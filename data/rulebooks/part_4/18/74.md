## Apples to Apples

### 1. Lore & Objective
Apples to Apples is a party game of humorous comparisons. Players win rounds by playing red noun cards that best match a green adjective card read aloud. The goal is to collect a target number of green cards by having your red cards chosen as the best match.

### 2. Components
- Red cards: Noun cards (people, places, things, concepts)
- Green cards: Adjective cards (descriptive words)

(Note: Exact card counts not specified in source.)

### 3. Setup
- Shuffle the red and green decks separately.
- Deal 7 red cards to each player.
- Choose a starting judge (rotates each turn).
- Place the green deck in the center.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. The current judge draws the top green card.
2. The judge reads the green card aloud.
3. Each other player selects 1 red card from their hand that they think best matches the green card.
4. Players place their chosen red cards face down in front of the judge.
5. The judge reveals the red cards and chooses the one they like best (funniest, most creative, most fitting, etc.).
6. The player who played the chosen red card wins the round.
7. The winner takes the green card as a point.
8. All players (except the judge) draw 1 red card to replenish their hand.
9. The next player becomes the judge.
10. Play continues clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Judging**: The judge decides the winning card using any criteria they prefer.
- **Hand Management**: Players maintain a hand of red cards and play one per round when not judging.
- **Turn Rotation**: The role of judge passes to the next player each round.
- **Card Drafting**: After each round, all non-judging players draw one red card.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Each green card won counts as 1 point.
- The game ends immediately when a player collects the target number of green cards:
  - 4 players: 8 green cards
  - 5 players: 7 green cards
  - 6 players: 6 green cards
  - 7 players: 5 green cards
  - 8 players: 4 green cards
- The first player to reach the target wins the game.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **What if a player runs out of red cards?** They draw during the replenish phase (step 8), so hands are maintained.
- **Can the judge play a card?** No. The judge does not play a red card during their turn.
- **Ties?** Not possible — the judge always chooses one winner.
- **What if the green deck runs out?** Shuffle the used green cards to form a new deck.
