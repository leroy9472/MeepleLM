## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Settlers of Catan – The Dice Game*, each player attempts to score the most points by building roads, settlements, cities, and soldiers on their personal map sheet of the island of Catan. The game simulates colonization and development through resource management, trading, and strategic placement.

Objective: Score the most points over 15 turns by constructing elements on your map sheet. Points are earned per build and recorded in a score track. Negative points are incurred if no construction is possible.

2. Components  
- 6 Resource dice (showing grain, ore, sheep, wood, brick, and gold)  
- 1 pad of 60 map sheets (one per player)  
- Writing implements (pen or pencil, ideally one per player)

3. Setup  
- Each player receives one map sheet.  
- Place the dice and writing tools within reach of all players.  
- Determine the first player by any agreed method.  
- Players will use their map sheet to track constructed elements and score points.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order. Each turn consists of three phases:  
1. **Collect Resources**  
   - Roll all six dice.  
   - May reroll up to six dice (i.e. any or all dice) once.  
   - May reroll up to six dice a second time.  
   - Final dice results are used for building.  
2. **Trade Resources**  
   - Use gold or jokers to convert resources:  
     - **Gold**: Trade 2 gold for 1 of any resource (no limit per turn).  
     - **Jokers**: Cross off the resource symbol from a field guarded by a soldier you’ve built. Use it to change one die to that resource type. Each field may be used only once per game. Multiple jokers may be used per turn.  
3. **Build**  
   - Spend resources from dice to build elements. Each die may be used only once per turn.  
   - Mark completed constructions on the map sheet (e.g. by outlining).  
   - Record total points earned this turn in the next available box on the score track (top right of sheet).  
   - If no construction is possible, mark a cross in the score box (−2 points).

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Resource Dice**: Show grain, ore, sheep, wood, brick, or gold. Rolled at the start of each turn.  
- **Building Rules**:  
  - **Roads**:  
    - First road is pre-built (free).  
    - Additional roads must connect to existing roads.  
    - May build past unoccupied settlement spaces.  
    - Cost: 1 wood + 1 brick.  
    - Worth 1 point each.  
  - **Settlements & Cities**:  
    - Must have a road leading to the space.  
    - Built in ascending point order: first the 3-point settlement, then 4, etc.  
    - Settlements and cities are scored independently (e.g., can build a 11-point city before a 3-point settlement).  
    - Settlements: 1 grain + 1 ore + 1 sheep + 1 wood. Worth 3–5 points.  
    - Cities: 2 grain + 3 ore. Worth 5–8 points.  
  - **Soldiers**:  
    - Built in ascending point order (e.g., 1-point soldier first).  
    - No road connection required.  
    - Cost: 1 grain + 1 ore + 1 sheep.  
    - Worth 1–3 points.  
    - Enable joker use: after building a soldier on a resource field, you may later cross off that field’s symbol to convert one die to that resource.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - Points from all constructions in a turn are summed and recorded in the next score box.  
  - If no build is possible, mark a cross (−2 points for that turn).

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends after each player has taken 15 turns (all 15 score boxes filled).  
- Total score = sum of all points in score boxes, minus 2 points for each cross (unsuccessful turn).  
- Highest total score wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I reroll gold dice?**  
  Yes. Gold dice may be rerolled like any other.  
- **Can I use multiple jokers in one turn?**  
  Yes, as long as each comes from a different guarded field and hasn’t been used before.  
- **Can I build multiple elements in one turn?**  
  Yes, if you have sufficient resources from dice (and trades), and each die is only used once.  
- **Do I have to build in order within a type?**  
  Yes. Settlements must be built in ascending point order (3 → 4 → 5…), same for cities and soldiers. You cannot skip a lower-point option and return to it later.  
- **What if I roll more of a resource than needed?**  
  Unused resources do not carry over. Only the current turn’s dice and trades count.  
- **Can I build a city without building the corresponding settlement?**  
  Yes. Cities and settlements are independent in build order.  
- **Can I build a road to a city without building the settlement in between?**  
  Yes, as long as the road connects properly. Settlements are not required to access cities.
