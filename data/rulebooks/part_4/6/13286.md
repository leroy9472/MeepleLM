## Gloria Mundi – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Gloria Mundi*, players take on the role of Roman statesmen fleeing Rome ahead of an advancing Visigoth army. The goal is to escape across the Mediterranean to Carthage in Africa. Players gather resources, build structures to aid their journey, and may delay the Visigoths by paying tribute. The first player to reach Carthage wins. If no one reaches Carthage, the player closest to it when the game ends wins.

### 2. Components  
- Game board (showing Rome, the Mediterranean route to Carthage, and the Visigoth track)  
- Player tokens (one per player)  
- Player screens  
- Production counters:  
  - Food (green)  
  - Gold (gold)  
  - Peace (white)  
  - Glory (purple, wild)  
- Production cards (by type: Food, Gold, Peace)  
- Building cards (with axe symbol on back)  
- Goth token  
- Building deck supply space and discard pile  
- Forum track (+5 to 0 spaces)

### 3. Setup  
#### Game Board  
- Place the board on the table.  
- Place production counters on their designated supply spaces.  
- Shuffle the building cards and place them face-down on the supply space next to the Forum.  
- Place the Goth token on its starting space at the top of the board (farthest from Rome).

#### Players  
Each player:  
- Chooses a Roman token and matching player screen.  
- Places their token on the Rome space in the center of the board.  
- Sets up their screen in front of them.  
- Takes 1 food, 1 gold, and 1 peace counter, placing them behind their screen.  
- Receives a hand of production cards based on player count (unused cards removed from game).  
- Places one of each type of production card (food, gold, peace) face-up in front of their screen.  

Starting player is chosen randomly. Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each player’s turn consists of five phases:

#### 1. Add a New Building Card to the Forum (Compulsory)  
- Draw the top card from the building deck and place it face-up on the +5 space of the Forum.  
- Shift all existing Forum cards down one space (e.g., +4 → +3, etc.).  
- Any card pushed from the 0 space is discarded.

#### 2. Play a Production Card (Compulsory)  
- The active player plays one production card from their hand into their play area.  
- This determines the production type for the turn (Food, Gold, or Peace), which will activate matching cards in Phase 3.

#### 3. All Players Activate Their Cards (Compulsory)  
- All players, starting with the active player, activate their cards of the current production type.  
- For each unoccupied production card of the active type, the player earns 1 matching production counter.  
- If a building is built on a production card, the player may choose to activate the building’s special ability **instead** of gaining a counter.  
- Players with multiple buildings may choose activation order.

#### 4. Buy a Building Card (Optional)  
- The active player may purchase one building card currently in the Forum.  
- Cost includes:  
  - The resource cost shown on the card (e.g., 2 food, 1 gold).  
  - An additional cost equal to the Forum space value (e.g., +4 requires 4 extra counters of any type).  
  - Glory counters may be used as wildcards for any resource.  
- To buy a building, the player must have an **unused** production card of the matching type (e.g., City buildings require a gold production card without a building).  
- After purchase:  
  - Pay all required resources.  
  - Place the building card on the appropriate production card in front of the player.  
  - Immediately gain the “Steps to Africa” benefit (move token toward Carthage).

#### 5. Pay Tribute to the Goth (Optional)  
- The active player may pay tribute to delay the Goth’s advance.  
- Tribute cost is determined by the icons on the space the Goth is about to move onto.  
- If the player pays:  
  - The Goth does **not** move.  
  - The tribute counters are placed in a line starting just ahead of the Goth, forming a tribute queue toward Rome.  
  - Glory counters may be used as wilds.  
- If the player **does not** pay:  
  - **If prior tributes exist**:  
    - The Goth advances to the space of the **last** tribute paid.  
    - All tribute counters are now "due." Starting with the active player, players take turns discarding one production card per tribute counter.  
    - If a discarded card has a building on it, the building is also discarded.  
    - Glory counters used in tribute must be paid with a card of the type they replaced.  
    - Once all counters are accounted for (or no player can pay), remaining unmatched counters go to the general pile.  
    - Players then take turns drawing one counter each from the pile until it's empty.  
  - **If no prior tributes exist**:  
    - The Goth moves forward one space.  
    - Players, starting with the active player, discard one production card per icon on the space the Goth entered.  
    - Discard rules apply as above.  
    - The active player’s turn ends after this phase.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Building Card Types  
- **City Buildings**: Must be built on **Gold** production cards.  
- **Farm Buildings**: Must be built on **Food** production cards.  
- **Peace Buildings**: Must be built on **Peace** production cards.  
- **Red Cards**: Special type (see below).

#### Building Card Details  
Each card includes:  
- **Name**  
- **Picture**  
- **Steps to Africa**: Movement granted when first purchased.  
- **Cost**: Resources needed to buy.  
- **Building Type**: Determines which production card it can be placed on.  
- **Special Ability**: Activated during Phase 3 (unless red card).

#### Special Abilities  
- **Spend A ⇒ B**: Spend resource A to gain B. If followed by "X", may be used multiple times.  
  - Example: “1 glory ⇒ 3 any (not glory)”  
- **Discard Building to…**: Discard another building to gain effect.  
  - Example: “Discard any building → move steps equal to its Africa value”  
  - Example: “Discard any building → gain counters equal to its cost”  
- **Produce B**: When activated, gain specified resources/steps.  
  - Example: “Gain 1 food & 1 step to Africa”  
- **Have A = B**: Gain B for each A you possess.  
  - Example: “1 food counter = 1 food counter” → gain 1 per food card you own  
- **Satisfy A : B**  
  - **Card Type : Resource**: When activated, all other cards of the specified type generate the resource. Replaces normal production.  
  - **Goth : Movement**: If the Goth is on a space requiring the specified tribute type, move 2 steps toward Africa.

#### Red Cards  
- **Not activated in Phase 3**.  
- **Two subtypes**:  
  1. **Built in Phase 4**:  
     - Can be placed on **any** production card.  
     - Effect: Convert one counter type to others at time of building.  
  2. **Played in Phase 5 (Tribute)**:  
     - Placed on a production card of the type shown.  
     - When the Goth moves and that card would be discarded, discard the red card instead.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when **any** of the following occur:  
- A player reaches Carthage.  
- The Goth reaches Rome.  
- A player has played all their production cards.  
- No building cards remain to be drawn in Phase 1.  

**Victory**:  
- The first player to reach Carthage **wins immediately**.  
- If the game ends otherwise, the player **closest to Carthage** wins.  
- In case of a tie, the player who is ahead on the track (closer to Africa) wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I activate multiple buildings on the same production card?**  
  No. Only one building can be built per production card.  
- **Can I use glory counters for the +value cost in the Forum?**  
  Yes. Glory counters are wild for all payment purposes.  
- **What happens if I can’t pay tribute when required?**  
  You skip your turn in the discard phase. The counter remains unpaid; continue with next player.  
- **Can I activate a building if I don’t use its production?**  
  Only if you choose to activate it instead of gaining the counter. You cannot skip both.  
- **Do I draw a new production card after playing one?**  
  No. Players have a limited hand; cards are played and not replaced.  
- **Can red cards be used more than once?**  
  No. Red cards used in tribute are discarded after use. Red cards built on production cards trigger their conversion once when built.
