## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The objective of Blackbeard is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the game. Victory Points are scored through:  
- 2 VP per Notoriety Point for retired pirates  
- 1 VP per 100 Net Worth (doubloons converted in port) for retired pirates  
- 1 VP per Notoriety Point for eliminated or surviving pirates (if not retired)  
- VP gains for Anti-Pirate (AP) players from damaging pirates, eliminating pirates via King’s Commissioners (KC), or surviving pirate attacks  

Pirates aim to loot merchant ships, attack ports, sack ports, and eventually retire in a safe location to maximize VP. The game ends when the General Pardon event card is played for the third time (standard) or after two full passes through the event deck with an added General Pardon (long game).

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows this sequence:  
1. Scurvy Check: All pirates with Scurvy lose 1 Crew Loyalty.  
2. D&R Resolution: Resolve any ongoing Drunkenness & Revelry.  
3. Draw Event Cards: Pirate player draws until holding 4. Resolve “Play Immediately” cards.  
4. Merchant Refresh: If fewer than 5 Merchant Ships on board, add face-down ships to reach 6.  
5. Pirate Actions Phase:  
   - Pirate player plays up to 1 Action card (may play multiple Event cards, but only 1 Action).  
   - Actions may be split among own Pirates (except diamond-icon cards).  
   - Pirate performs chosen action.  
6. Anti-Pirate (AP) Actions:  
   - Each AP player may take 1 AP Action during the Pirate player’s turn.  
   - AP Actions may not repeat against the same Pirate action.  
   - No AP Actions during Pirate drawing or deploying new Pirates.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Move**: Move between Sea Areas, Ports, or Transit Boxes. Cannot enter Sea Area with own KC.  
- **Find Merchant Ship**: Roll 1d6 + Ability (+1 if ship face-up). Success on 7+.  
- **Loot Merchant Ship**: After successful Find, roll 1d6 + Cargo Rating to determine loot value. Draw Hostage. Gain Notoriety = Cargo Rating. Choose to take cargo (adjust loyalty if roll = 3 or 8).  
- **Convert Merchant Ship**: Immediately after looting. Only Sloops, Schooners, Brigantines can be converted. Adjust Combat/Speed to max. Crew Loyalty ±1 based on hold size change.  
- **In-Port Activities** (1 action total, in order):  
  1. Ransom Hostages (same nationality port; never Arab/Portuguese)  
  2. Convert Doubloons to Net Worth (ratios vary by port type)  
  3. Refit (remove damage; Pirate ports remove all)  
  4. Buy Safe Haven (Pro-Pirate port only; cost 1d6×100 Net Worth)  
  5. Enter D&R (voluntary or involuntary)  
- **Attack Port**: Roll 1d6 + Combat + Ability + Info vs. 1d6 + Port Defense (2d6 if previously attacked). Success: gain 2×Port Value Notoriety, 100×Port Value×d6 doubloons, enter port, ship takes 1 damage.  
- **Sack Port**: Roll 1d6 + Cruelty vs. Port Defense. Success: gain 3×Port Value Notoriety, destroy port, crew loyalty +1.  
- **D&R Recovery**: In port. Voluntary: 1 action to clear. Involuntary: 2 actions. Upon full recovery: +1 Loyalty (non-Pirate port), +3 Loyalty (Pirate port).  
- **Booty Grab**: In same port as D&R Pirate. Grabber rolls 1d6 + Ability +1, target rolls 1d6 + Ability. Difference determines outcome: gain holds, lose loyalty, or duel.  
- **Retire**: Only in Pro-Pirate, Neutral (with LoM), or Safe Haven. Gain 2 VP/Notoriety, 1 VP/100 Net Worth.  
- **Deploy New Pirate**: Within hand and play limits. Requires Letter of Marque or Safe Haven.  

Anti-Pirate Actions:  
- **Deploy KC**: Roll 3d6 < Pirate Notoriety. Only one KC per player.  
- **Use KC**:  
  - Move  
  - Attack Pirate (intercept via Speed roll, then combat)  
  - Oust Pirate from port (1d6 + KC Combat vs. 1d6 + Pirate Combat +1 per extra Pirate)  
  - Attack Pirate Port (1d6 + KC Combat vs. each Pirate’s 1d6 + Combat)  
- **Use Warship**:  
  - Intercept via Speed roll, then combat.  
  - Warship wins: Pirate takes damage, loses loyalty, action canceled.  
  - Pirate wins: Warship removed, Pirate gains Notoriety = half Warship Combat (rounded down).  
- **Play AP Event Card**: Follow card text.  

Special Ship Rules (Flute, 3-Masted Square Rigger):  
- Speed: 1, Holds: 2, Combat: 4 (Flute); Speed: 1, Holds: 5, Combat: 7 (3-Masted)  
- −1 modifier to Find Merchant Ship rolls (1d6 + Ability −1; success on 7+)  
- Speed value underlined on counter as reminder  

KC Reaction Rule:  
- KCs may react to Pirate Actions in same or adjacent Sea Area every time such action occurs.  
- Only one KC may react per Pirate Action (first declaration wins).  
- Not an AP Action; can be used alongside one AP Action per turn.  
- KC moves into Pirate’s Sea Area if adjacent.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Scoring occurs immediately when:  
- Pirate converts doubloons to Net Worth  
- Pirate gains Notoriety (looting, sacking, combat)  
- AP damages pirate (1 VP per damage)  
- KC eliminates pirate (VP = half pirate’s Notoriety)  
- Pirate defeats KC (gains Notoriety = half KC’s Combat)  

Game ends when:  
- General Pardon played 3rd time (standard)  
- Two event deck passes + General Pardon (long)  

Final Scoring:  
- Retired Pirate: 2 VP/Notoriety, 1 VP/100 Net Worth  
- Eliminated (by non-KC): 1 VP/Notoriety, 0 Net Worth  
- Surviving (not retired): 1 VP/Notoriety, 0 Net Worth
