# MUNCHKIN — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
MUNCHKIN is a satirical dungeon-crawling card game where players compete to reach Level 10 before anyone else. The goal is to kill monsters, steal treasure, and betray allies — all in the name of personal advancement. The first player to reach Level 10 wins, but **the 10th level must be gained by defeating a monster in combat**. Cards and special abilities may override general rules.

- **Player Pawns**: Used to track levels on the game board (if used).
- **Six-sided Die**: Used for escape rolls during combat.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of **three main phases**:

#### Phase 1: Kick Open the Door
- Draw **one card face-up** from the Door deck.
  - **Monster**: You must fight it immediately. After combat, skip Phase 2.
  - **Curse**: Apply its effect immediately to you. Discard unless it has ongoing effects.
  - **Other Card** (Race, Class, Item, etc.): You may play it immediately or add it to your hand.

#### Phase 2: Look for Trouble or Loot the Room
(Only if you did **not** draw a monster in Phase 1)
- **Option A: Look for Trouble**
  - Play a monster from your hand and fight it.
- **Option B: Loot the Room**
  - Draw **one face-down card** from the Treasure deck into your hand.

#### Phase 3: Charity
- You may hold a maximum of **5 cards** in hand (Dwarves may hold 6).
- If you have more than the limit:
  - Give excess cards to the **lowest-level player(s)**.
  - If tied, divide as evenly as possible (you choose who gets extras).
  - If **you are the lowest level**, discard excess to the discard pile.

  - Items you are carrying
  - Cards from your hand (if playable)
  - Agreed portion of monster’s treasure

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I change equipment during combat?**  
  No. Equipment is locked once combat starts.

- **Can I discard items freely?**  
  No. Items can only be discarded via:
  - Selling
  - Trading
  - Card effects (Curses, Bad Stuff, abilities)
  - Discarding to power Class/Race abilities

- **What happens to my Hireling if I die?**  
  It is lost unless it has a GP value and was carried — then it’s looted like any item.

- **Can I play a Curse on myself?**  
  Yes — if it benefits you (e.g., to trigger a bonus or avoid a worse fate).

- **Do I get treasure if I defeat a monster without killing it?**  
  Only if the card says so. Examples:
  - **Charm Spell (Wizard)**: Take treasure, no level.
  - **Bribe**: May avoid fight but no reward.

- **Can I fight a monster I played from my hand?**  
  Yes — during "Look for Trouble" phase.

- **What if a deck runs out?**  
  Reshuffle its discard pile. If no discards, no more draws of that type.

- **Conflicts: Card vs. Rule**  
  **Cards override rules**. If a card says something different, follow the card.
