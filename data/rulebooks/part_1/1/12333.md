## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Twilight Struggle simulates the Cold War rivalry between the United States (USA) and the Soviet Union (USSR) from 1947 to 1991. Players compete to expand their ideological influence across the globe while avoiding nuclear war. Victory is achieved by gaining 20 more Victory Points (VP) than the opponent, controlling Europe when its scoring card is played, or forcing the opponent into a nuclear war (DEFCON 1). If no player achieves automatic victory, the game ends after 10 turns with final scoring.

### 2. Components
- Game map divided into regions and countries, with stability numbers and battleground indicators
- Influence markers (USA and USSR)
- Three card decks: Early War, Mid War, Late War
- The China Card (4 Ops, 5 Ops in Asia)
- Tracks: Turn Record, Victory Points (VP), DEFCON, Military Operations, Space Race
- Markers: Turn, VP, DEFCON, Military Ops, Space Race
- 54 event cards with Ops values, events, and star indicators (USSR ★, USA ☆, Neutral ★/☆)

### 3. Setup
1. Place markers:
   - DEFCON at 5
   - Turn Marker at Turn 1
   - VP, Military Ops, and Space Race markers at 0
   - DEFCON restriction tokens at levels 4, 3, and 2
2. Shuffle Early War deck; deal 8 cards to each player.
3. USSR starts with The China Card face-up (not counted in hand).
4. Place initial influence:
   - USSR: 3 in East Germany, 3 in North Korea, 1 each in Finland, Syria, Iraq, and 6 in Eastern Europe
   - USA: 5 in UK, 4 in Australia, 1 each in Canada, Iran, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, South Africa, Panama, and 7 in Western Europe

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn follows this sequence:
1. **Improve DEFCON**: Increase DEFCON by 1 (max 5)
2. **Deal Cards**: Refill hands to 8 cards (Turns 1–3) or 9 cards (Turns 4–10). The China Card does not count toward hand size.
3. **Headline Phase**: Simultaneously reveal one card for its event only. Resolve in order of descending Ops value (USA wins ties). Scoring cards resolve last. Cannot play The China Card.
4. **Action Rounds**: 6 rounds (Turns 1–3), 7 rounds (Turns 4–10). USSR acts first. Each player plays one card per round.
5. **Check Military Operations**: Compare Military Ops to current DEFCON. For each point below, lose 1 VP. Reset track to 0.
6. **Reveal Held Card**: In tournament play, reveal any held card. Holding a scoring card results in loss.
7. **Flip The China Card**: If passed facedown, flip to face-up for next player.
8. **Advance Turn Marker**: Move to next turn. Shuffle Mid War deck at end of Turn 3; Late War deck at end of Turn 7.
9. **Final Scoring**: After Turn 10, score all regions and determine winner.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Playing a Card
Each card may be used in one of four ways:
- **Operations (Ops)**: Spend all Ops on one action (place influence, coup, realignment).
- **Event**: Trigger the card’s event (only for own or neutral cards).
- **Opponent's Event**: Playing an opponent’s card for Ops triggers their event. You choose event timing (before or after Ops).
- **Space Race**: Discard card (once per turn) to attempt advancement. Event is ignored.

#### Operations Actions (choose one per card)
1. **Place Influence**
   - Place 1 marker per Ops.
   - Must be in or adjacent to a country where you had presence at start of the round.
   - Costs:
     - 1 Ops: uncontrolled or friendly-controlled country
     - 2 Ops: enemy-controlled country
   - Cost drops to 1 if control is flipped during placement.
   - Flip marker to solid side upon gaining control.

2. **Coup Attempt**
   - Target country must have opponent influence.
   - DEFCON restricts regions available for coups.
   - In battleground countries, DEFCON decreases by 1.
   - Coup value = Ops + die roll – (2 × Stability Number)
   - Opponent loses influence equal to positive result; excess becomes your influence.
   - Move Military Ops marker by Ops value of card.

3. **Realignment Roll**
   - 1 Ops = 1 roll.
   - Target any country with opponent influence (subject to DEFCON restrictions).
   - Both players roll; modifiers:
     - +1 for each adjacent controlled country
     - +1 if you have more influence in target
     - +1 if target adjacent to your superpower
   - Loser removes influence equal to difference in modified rolls.
   - Does not affect Military Ops.

4. **Space Race**
   - Once per turn, play card with Ops ≥ next space cost.
   - Roll die; succeed if result in specified range.
   - Advance marker; gain VP and/or special ability (only first player to reach space).
   - Second player cancels ability and gains lower VP.
   - Event is not triggered.

#### Control & Scoring
- **Country Control**: Your influence ≥ (Opponent influence + Stability Number)
- **Regional Scoring** (via scoring cards):
  - **Presence**: Control at least one country
  - **Domination**: Control more total countries and more battlegrounds (must include at least one non-battleground)
  - **Control**: Control more total countries and all battlegrounds
- **Scoring Points**:
  - Net difference between players is applied to VP track.
  - +1 VP per controlled battleground in region
  - +1 VP per controlled country adjacent to enemy superpower

#### The China Card
- Starts with USSR, face-up
- 4 Ops (5 Ops if played in Asia)
- When played, pass facedown to opponent
- Flipped face-up at end of turn
- Cannot be played in Headline Phase or if it would prevent playing a scoring card

#### DEFCON & Military Operations
- **DEFCON Track**: Starts at 5, increases by 1 at start of each turn
- **Nuclear War**: If DEFCON reaches 1, phasing player loses immediately
- **Coup Restrictions**:
  - DEFCON 4: No coups in Asia
  - DEFCON 3: No coups in Asia, Europe
  - DEFCON 2: No coups in Asia, Europe, Middle East
- **Military Operations**:
  - Required = current DEFCON level
  - Gained from coups and War events
  - Penalty: Lose 1 VP per shortfall
  - Free coup rolls do not count

#### Card Events
- **Starred Cards (*)**: Removed from game after being triggered as event
- **Underlined Cards**: Persistent effect; remain in play until canceled
- **Opponent Events**: Triggered when you play their card for Ops
- **Headline Events**: Resolved before Action Rounds; opponent implements their own event if played

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Victory Conditions
- **Automatic Victory**:
  - Reach +20 VP on track
  - Control Europe when Europe Scoring is played
  - Opponent causes DEFCON to reach 1
  - Wargames card played at DEFCON 2 (opponent gains 6 VP, game ends)
- **End of Game Victory** (after Turn 10):
  - Score all regions as if their scoring cards were played
  - +1 VP for holding The China Card
  - Player with higher VP total wins

#### Final Scoring
- Score all 6 regions (Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa, Central America, South America)
- Southeast Asia scoring card is not used in final scoring
- Apply all modifiers (battlegrounds, adjacency)
- Net VP difference determines winner

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Holding Scoring Cards**: Must play during turn received. Holding one at end of turn results in loss.
- **China Card**: Never mandatory to play. Can be held.
- **Event Timing**: When playing opponent’s card, you choose whether event or Ops happen first.
- **War Events**: Always count as Military Ops for the event’s owner, regardless of who plays the card.
- **Card Shortage**: If draw deck is empty, reshuffle discard pile (excluding removed cards).
- **Ties in Headline Ops**: USA resolves first.
- **Defcon Suicide**: Playing a card that lowers DEFCON to 1 on your turn causes you to lose.
- **Free Coup Rolls**: Do not count toward Military Ops; ignore DEFCON restrictions.
