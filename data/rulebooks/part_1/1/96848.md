### 1. Lore & Objective
In Mage Knight, players take on the role of powerful Mage Knights exploring a dangerous world, battling monsters, conquering sites, and gaining fame. The objective is to earn the most Fame Points by defeating enemies, completing objectives, and dominating scoring categories at the end of the game, which lasts 3–6 rounds or until a scenario-specific end condition is met.

### 2. Components
- Hero cards and Skill tokens  
- Deed decks (16-card personalized deck per player)  
- Map tiles (hexes for terrain, cities, keeps, etc.)  
- Mana dice (red, blue, green, white, gold, black)  
- Unit decks and Unit Offer cards  
- Advanced Action cards and Spell cards  
- Reputation track and fame points  
- Wound cards and discard piles  
- Round Order tokens and Tactic cards  
- Player mats, shields, crystals, and command tokens  

### 3. Setup
1. Choose a Hero: Each player selects a Hero with unique starting cards and skills.  
2. Map Setup: Place starting hex and two adjacent hexes. Add countryside and core tiles as per scenario.  
3. Mana Source: Roll 2 + X mana dice (minimum 3, at least half showing basic colors: red, blue, green, white) into the Source area.  
4. Draw Starting Hand: Each player shuffles their Deed Deck and draws 5 cards.  
5. Tactic Selection: Players choose Day Tactic cards to determine turn order and special abilities.  
6. Solo Variant Setup (if applicable):  
   - Use a Dummy Player with a randomized Hero.  
   - Remove Hero’s black skull skill token.  
   - Remove Spells 109–112.  
   - Set 3 units in Unit Offer.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of multiple turns, alternating between players. A round is either Day or Night, indicated by the Day/Night board.

**Round Structure:**
1. **Turn Sequence (per player):**  
   - Move across the board (spending movement points based on terrain).  
   - Interact with sites (fight, recruit, heal, explore).  
   - Play cards from hand to move, attack, block, or use abilities.  
   - Use 1 mana from the Source per turn (reroll and return die after use).  
   - At end of turn:  
     - Reroll used mana die and return to Source.  
     - Discard played cards and used crystals.  
     - Claim rewards (fame, spells, artifacts) if applicable.  
     - Discard down: Must discard 1 card if none were played; otherwise, discard any number.  
     - Draw back up to hand limit (normally 5).  

2. **End of Round Trigger:**  
   - A player may announce End of Round if:  
     - Deed Deck is empty at start of turn and has no cards in hand → **must** announce.  
     - Deed Deck is empty at start of turn but has cards in hand → **may** announce (but cannot play cards or use space benefits).  
     - Dummy Player’s deck is empty → End of Round is announced.  
   - After announcement, each other player takes **one final turn**.  

3. **Preparing for New Round:**  
   a. **Flip Day/Night Board** (Day 1 → Night 1 → Day 2 → etc.)  
   b. **Reroll Mana Dice:**  
      - At least half must show basic colors (red, blue, green, white).  
      - Black rolled during Day or Gold during Night → place in upper right of Source (depleted, unusable).  
   c. **Reset Unit Offer:**  
      - Return unrecruited units to bottom of unit deck.  
      - Reveal new offer: (# players + 2) units.  
      - Advanced Action cards from Monasteries go to bottom of Advanced Action deck.  
      - For each non-burned Monastery on board, add a new Advanced Action card to Unit Offer.  
   d. **Refresh Advanced Action Offer:**  
      - Remove lowest card → return to bottom of deck (or give to Dummy Player’s hand if used).  
      - Shift cards down, refill top spot.  
   e. **Refresh Spell Offer:**  
      - Remove lowest card → return to bottom of deck (or give 1 crystal of matching color to Dummy Player).  
      - Shift cards down, refill top spot.  
   f. **Each Player:**  
      1. Shuffle Deed Deck and draw new hand.  
         - Hand limit bonuses:  
           - +1 per owned Keep (if on or adjacent).  
           - +1 if in/adjacent to city with ≥1 shield; +2 if city leader.  
           - Only highest bonus applies.  
      2. Ready all units and skill tokens (wounded units remain wounded).  
      3. Choose new Tactic cards.  
         - Order: lowest fame chooses first; tiebreaker: last to play in prior round.  
         - Dummy Player chooses randomly.  
   g. **Rearrange Round Order Tokens** based on Tactic card numbers.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Movement
- Spend movement points based on terrain.  
- Cannot end turn on another player (except in cities or during combat).  
- Moving adjacent to rampaging enemy triggers combat.  
- Exploring new tile grants 1 fame (in intro scenario).  
- Split movement between moving and exploring.  
- Playing cards sideways: spend 1 card sideways to gain 1 extra movement, attack, block, or influence.

#### Mana System
- **Basic Colors:** Red, Blue, Green, White.  
- **Gold Mana:** Wildcard; usable only during Day.  
- **Black Mana:** Usable only during Night; not a wildcard — used to amplify spell effects.  
- **Mana Token:** Gained and used immediately; lost if not used by end of turn.  
- **Mana Crystal:** Stored in inventory indefinitely; convert to usable mana at any time (crystal discarded).  
- **Source:** Common mana pool.  
  - 1 mana per turn allowed from Source.  
  - After use, reroll die and return.  
  - Depleted: Black during Day or Gold during Night → set aside, unusable.  
- **Inventory Limit:** Max 3 crystals of any single basic color.

#### Combat Phases
1. **Ranged/Siege Attack Phase:**  
   - Only ranged or siege attacks allowed.  
   - Total attack value ≥ enemy armor to defeat.  
   - Can combine ranged and siege against ranged-susceptible enemies; **cannot** combine against siege-only enemies.  
   - Cards cannot be played sideways.  
   - Damage not tracked if insufficient — no partial effect.  

2. **Block Phase:**  
   - Surviving enemies attack.  
   - Block value ≥ attack value to fully block (binary result).  
   - Can play non-wound cards sideways to add to block.  
   - Units with block abilities may be activated.  
   - If not fully blocked, full damage passes through.  

3. **Assign Damage Phase:**  
   - Assign unblocked damage one attack at a time.  
   - May assign to Mage Knight or unwounded units.  
   - **To Unit:**  
     - Take 1 wound card.  
     - Reduce damage by unit’s armor.  
     - If damage remains, continue assigning.  
     - Resistant units absorb damage equal to armor once per combat.  
   - **To Mage Knight:**  
     - Take ⌈damage / armor⌉ wound cards into hand.  
     - Wound cards stay in hand permanently unless healed.  
     - **Knocked Out:** If wounds ≥ unmodified hand limit (level-based), discard all non-wound cards.  
   - **Special Damage Effects:**  
     - Brutal: Double damage if unblocked.  
     - Poison: Unit gets 2 wounds; Hero gains 1 wound in discard per wound taken.  
     - Paralyze: Unit destroyed; Hero discards all non-wound cards.  
     - Assassination: Damage must be assigned to Hero only.  
     - Cumbersome: Spend movement points to reduce attack value.  
     - Summon: Draw random brown token enemy for this phase only.  

4. **Attack Phase:**  
   - Defeat enemies by playing attacks ≥ total armor.  
   - Can use:  
     - Attack cards.  
     - Ranged/Siege attacks.  
     - Cards played sideways.  
     - Unit attacks (ready, healthy units only).  
   - Grouping enemies:  
     - Attack value must ≥ combined armor.  
     - Attack is inefficient if **any** enemy has resistance to attack type.  
     - Fortified enemies require Siege attacks only.  

5. **Combat Outcomes:**  
   - **Victory:**  
     - Rampaging enemy: removed; gain +1/+2 rep (Orc/Dragon).  
     - Adventure site (Dungeon, Tomb, etc.): mark with shield; claim reward at end of turn.  
     - Fortified site (Keep, Mage Tower, City): end turn on space; mark with shield.  
       - Mage Tower: gain spell from offer.  
       - City: see city assault rules.  
     - Monastery: burn (mark with shield); claim artifact.  
   - **Defeat:**  
     - Rampaging enemy: remains.  
     - Dungeon/Tomb: discard enemies; redraw next entry.  
     - Monster Den/Spawning Grounds/Ruins: enemies return.  
     - Fortified site: withdraw to attacking space.  
       - If unsafe, use Forced Withdrawal:  
         - Backtrack to safe space (accessible, not enemy keep, not occupied).  
         - Take 1 wound per space moved.  

#### Wounds & Healing
- **Wounded Mage Knight:**  
  - Wound cards in hand count toward hand limit.  
  - Cannot discard unless effect allows.  
- **Wounded Units:**  
  - Cannot activate or be assigned damage until healed.  
- **Healing:**  
  - Healing Points from cards, units, or villages.  
  - Spend:  
    - Mage Knight: 1 HP = remove 1 wound card to wound pile.  
    - Unit: HP = unit level; remove wound card. Poisoned units require 2 heals.  
  - Healing cannot be done during combat.  
- **Resting:**  
  - Skip actions and movement.  
  - Play special/healing cards.  
  - Discard 1 non-wound card + any number of wounds (not healing).  
- **Exhaustion:**  
  - Start turn with only wound cards → discard 1 wound.  
  - Cannot move or act.  
  - May play healing/special cards and use space benefits.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends after 3–6 rounds or when scenario condition is met.  
- **Fame Points:** Earned from defeating enemies, site rewards, and objectives.  
- **Bonus Points:** Awarded for leading in categories (e.g., most cities, keeps, artifacts).  
- **Final Score:** Fame Points + Bonus Points.  
- Highest score wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use black mana during the day?**  
  No. Black rolled during day is depleted and unusable.  
- **Can I store more than 3 crystals of one color?**  
  No, unless you are the Dummy Player (allowed in solo).  
- **What if I run out of cards mid-turn?**  
  Finish your turn. End of Round is announced at start of next turn if deck is empty.  
- **Can I block part of a multi-attack?**  
  No. Each attack is resolved individually. Must fully block each or take full damage.  
- **Can I assign damage to a resistant unit twice?**  
  No. A unit cannot be assigned damage twice in one combat, even if it resists the first.  
- **Can I heal during combat?**  
  No. Healing can only be done outside of combat.  
- **Does Forced Withdrawal trigger exploration?**  
  No. Backtracking does not trigger tile reveals or exploration effects.
