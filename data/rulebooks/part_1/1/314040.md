### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Passport & Alias Rules
- Each Passport has **3 aliases** (NATO, Neutral, Soviet).
- At the **start of your turn**, assume the alias matching your **current city’s affiliation**.
- Use **only** the abilities on that alias. Ignore all other text (e.g., Legacy-specific assets/flaws).

#### Player Actions (4 per turn)
- **Drive/Ferry:** Move to adjacent city.
- **Flight:** Discard city card to fly to any city. **Cannot fly directly between NATO and Soviet cities.**
- **Neutralize Agent:** Remove **1 Soviet Agent** from current city.
- **Share Intel:** Exchange 1 card with another player in the same city (each player spends 1 action).
- **Build Research Facility:** Discard matching city card to build in current city. **Cannot build in Soviet cities or cities with existing Facility.**
- **Assemble a Team:** At a Research Facility, discard **5 matching faction city cards** (NATO, Neutral, or Soviet) to place a Team of that affiliation.
- **Drive/Ferry a Team:** Move a Team to an adjacent city. **You must be in the same city as the Team.**
- **Solo Missions:** Complete one of your 3 secret missions:
  - **Intel Mission:** Move to NATO city, “pick up Intel” (1 action), deliver to designated Soviet city.
  - **Target Mission:** Move to target city, “capture target” (1 action), deliver to any Research Facility.
  - **Sabotage Mission:** Reach city, discard 3 specified cards, complete sabotage.
  - Completed missions are kept face down.

#### Mop Up (Remove Disease Cubes)
- **Cannot remove Disease Cubes directly.**
- To remove:
  1. Assemble a Team at a Research Facility.
  2. Move the Team (via Drive/Ferry a Team) to an infected city.
  3. Upon arrival, **Team automatically removes the Disease Cube**.
  - Teams remain in place and **prevent new Soviet Agents** from being placed in that city.

#### Launching Satellites
- **Requirements:**
  - City must have a **Research Facility** and an **assembled Team**.
  - **Cannot launch from Soviet cities.**
- **Action:** Spend 1 action to launch.
  - Take **Satellite Card** for that region.
  - Place **Satellite Token** on the region.
  - **Counter-Intelligence:** Immediately place **1 Soviet Agent** in each city in that region that does **not** already have an agent.

#### Symptoms
- When a player **enters a city with a Disease Cube**, draw **1 Symptom Card**.
- If a player accumulates **3 Symptoms**, they **die** and are removed from the game.
- Remaining players continue.

#### Double Agent Variant
- The player who drew **Spy Card 06-04d** is the **Double Agent**.
- They **secretly pursue Soviet objectives** while appearing cooperative.
- Their solo missions are interpreted as supporting the Soviet side.
