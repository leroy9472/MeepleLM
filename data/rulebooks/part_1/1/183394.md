## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Viticulture Essential Edition*, players take on the roles of vintners managing a Tuscan vineyard over multiple in-game years. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) by fulfilling wine orders, building prestige, and growing your estate. The game ends when any player reaches or exceeds 20 VP at the end of a year. The player with the most VPs wins. Tiebreakers: (1) Most Lira, (2) Total value of wine in cellar, (3) Total value of grapes on crush pads.

   - Places rooster above wake-up chart, cork on 0 of VP track, wine bottle on middle (0) of Residual Payment track.  
2. Place gray temporary worker on bottom row of wake-up chart.  
3. Shuffle four card decks and place on board.  
4. Randomly choose first player; give green grape token.  
5. Deal one Mama and one Papa card to each player.  
   - Choose one Mama and one Papa to keep; gain their starting resources (workers, cards, lira, etc.).

6. Players place initial resources (e.g., vines, visitors, lira) as indicated.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Harvesting Grapes  
- Harvesting a field sums all red and white grape icons on vines in that field.  
- One red and one white grape token are placed on crush pad (one per color).  
- Each field may be harvested only once per year.  
- If crush pad value slot is occupied, place token on next lowest available slot.  
- Vines remain after harvest.

#### Making Wine  
- Convert grape tokens on crush pad to wine in cellar.  
- Max 2 wines normally, 3 with bonus.  
- Types:  
  - **Red/White Wine**: 1:1 conversion. Value = grape value.  
  - **Blush**: 1 red + 1 white grape → 1 blush wine (value = sum).  
  - **Sparkling**: 2 red + 1 white grape → 1 sparkling wine (value = grape value).  
- Wine must fit in cellar:  
  - **Small Cellar**: Red/White wines only, values 1–3  
  - **Medium Cellar**: Red/White 1–6, Blush 4–6  
  - **Large Cellar**: All wines, Red/White 1–9, Blush 4–9, Sparkling 7–9  

#### Aging  
- At end of year, all grape and wine tokens increase in value by 1, if space allows.  
- Grapes on crush pads: can age up to value 9, even without cellar.  
- Wines in cellar: aging limited by cellar size.  
- If no higher slot available, token stays.

#### Structures  
- **Trellis** (£2): Required to plant vines with trellis icon.  
- **Irrigation** (£3): Required to plant vines with irrigation icon.  
- **Windmill** (£5): Gain 1 VP when planting a vine (max 1/year).  
- **Yoke** (£2): Grants private action space to harvest or uproot (1x/season).  
- **Cottage** (£4): Draw extra visitor card in Fall.  
- **Tasting Room** (£6): Gain 1 VP when giving tour if you have ≥1 wine in cellar.  
- **Medium Cellar** (£4): Required for blush and wines 4–6.  
- **Large Cellar** (£6): Must have Medium Cellar first; required for sparkling and wines 7–9.

#### Visitor Cards  
- Drawn in Fall.  
- Played in Summer (yellow) or Winter (blue) on designated action spaces.  
- Must be able to fully resolve effect to play.  
- Cannot play if effect would reduce VP below –5.  
- If deck runs out, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.

#### End-of-Year Phase  
1. **Check for Winner**: If any player has ≥20 VP, game ends after this year.  
2. **Age Tokens**: All grape and wine tokens increase by 1 (if space allows).  
3. **Return Workers**: All workers go back to player boards. Gray temporary worker returns to wake-up chart.  
4. **Collect Residual Payments**: Gain Lira equal to position on Residual Payment track (max 5).  
5. **Discard Cards**: All players discard down to 7 cards (any combination of vine, visitor, wine order).  
6. **Rotate First Player**: Pass green grape token counterclockwise.  
7. **Start New Year** with Spring.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory Points** earned by:  
  - Fulfilling wine orders (immediate VP)  
  - Visitor card effects  
  - Structures (Windmill, Tasting Room)  
- **Game End**: Triggered when any player reaches 20+ VP. Finish current year, then final scoring.  
- **Win Condition**: Most VP. Tiebreakers:  
  1. Most Lira  
  2. Total value of wine in cellar  
  3. Total value of grapes on crush pads
