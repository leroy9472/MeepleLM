     - Footprint paths: require 2 or 3 Boots.  
     - Mountain paths: require indicated Boots; reduced to 1 with Pickaxe.  
     - Monster paths: 1 damage per icon; prevent 1 damage per Sword spent or Sacrifice an Intern.  
     - Open Water: requires Canoe Token.  
     - One-way arrows: movement only in direction shown.  
     - Teleport: move directly; ignore path requirements.

   - **Hire a Coach**: On Coach space, spend 1 Boot + Gold equal to sum of departure and destination Coach space costs. Teleport to any Coach space.

   - **Clank!**:  
     - Gain Clank!: add cubes to Clank! Area.

   - **Dragon Attack**:  
     1. Move all Clank! Area cubes to Dragon Bag.  
     2. Draw cubes = current Rage Track number + 1 per Danger Card in Adventure Row.  
     3. Colored cube drawn = 1 damage to owner.  
     4. Black cube drawn = set aside.  
     5. Wight cube drawn = 1 damage to all players.  
     6. Intern cube drawn = return to supply.  
     7. If Dragon Bag is empty after attack, game ends; all remaining players are Knocked Out.  
   - **Health & Damage**:  
     - Damage: place cube on lowest available Health Meter space.  
     - Full Health Meter = Knocked Out.  
     - Heal: return cube to supply.  
     - Cannot take voluntary damage if no cubes in supply or would be knocked out.

     - **Volcano**: Enter = may trash 1 card from discard or play area.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - **Game End**: When all players are “off the clock”:  
     - **Escaped**: Reach HQ with Artifact → remove Figure, remove Clank! cubes, take Mug Token (+20 VP).  
     - **Knocked Out**: Health Meter full → out of game.  
     - If player is off the clock but has no Artifact or is in Danger Zone → scores 0.  
   - **Final Scoring** (for non-zero players):  
     - Artifact VP value (0 if no Artifact).  
     - 20/40 Artifact: worth 40 VP if player has at least 1 Dragon Egg.  
     - 1 VP per Gold.  
     - VP from cards in deck/hand/discard (top right corner).  
     - VP from tokens (Mug, Market Items, Secrets).  
     - 10 VP per 3 Seals of Excellence.  
     - VP from Patron effects.  
     - 1 VP per Clank! Cube on Shrines (max 1 per Shrine).  
   - **Winning**: Highest VP wins. Tiebreaker: most valuable Artifact.  

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Dragon Bag Empty**: Game ends immediately; all remaining players are Knocked Out.  
   - **Negative Clank!**: If not enough Clank! in Clank! Area, may remove later in turn. Leftover negative lost at turn end.  
   - **Healing at Full Health**: Not allowed.  
   - **Escaped Players**: On their turn, perform Dragon Attack: draw exactly 4 cubes (6 in 2-player), ignoring Rage Track and Danger.  
   - **Trashing vs Destroying**: Trashing is temporary (card returns after game); Destroying is permanent (legacy).  
   - **Event Cards**: Resolved immediately when revealed during refill, then discarded.  
   - **Contracts**: Carry over between games. Completed ones may be destroyed.  
   - **Mystic Fruit**: Flip to expended side when used; one-time use per game.
