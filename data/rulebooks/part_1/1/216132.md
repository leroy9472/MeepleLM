### 3. Setup
1. **Map Assembly**: Randomly select a side for each of the 4 Map Modules (A–D). Place them so the rocks showing the letters form a clockwise alphabetical ring in the center.
2. **Port Bonus Tiles**: Shuffle the 9 Port Bonus Tiles. Randomly place 4 adjacent to factories in the map corners, using the player-count arrows (1–2P or 3–4P).
3. **Market Board**: Flip to the correct side based on player count. Place Price Markers on starting prices. Place Goods tokens and tiles below the board in separate piles.
4. **Export Board**: Flip to correct side. Shuffle 9 Scoring Tiles, place 5 face-up randomly on the edge slots. Shuffle Export Contracts into a face-down stack. Place 1 face-up contract per crate (3 players: leave 1 crate empty).
5. **Player Setup**: Each player chooses a color and takes:
   - 1 Player Board
   - 4 each: Sheep, Cows, Cheese Dairies, Bakeries, Fields, Distilleries
   - 8 Workers (4 Woodcutters, 4 Miners)
   - 7 Merchant Cubes (5 on track, 2 in supply)
   - 1 Shipping Token (on first space of track)
   - 2 Technology Tiles (arrow-side up under Workers)
   - 1 Export Box Tile (correct side up)
   - 1 Glory Token (next to Export Board)
   - 1 Settlement Token (on Glory Track)
   - 4 Port Markers
   - 1 Turn Order Token
6. **Determine Start Player**: Randomly pick one. Place Turn Order Tokens clockwise on the Export Board.
7. **Clan Selection**: Shuffle Clan Tiles and Starting Tiles. Reveal #players + 1 of each. In reverse turn order, players choose a Clan + Starting Tile combo and gain the shown goods and money.
8. **Initial Worker Placement**: 
   - Starting player places 1 Worker (Woodcutter on Forest, Miner on Mountain) on any valid space, paying land + unit cost.
   - Continue clockwise.
   - Then, in reverse order, each player places a second Worker (same rules).
9. **2-Player Variant**: Shaded edge spaces are not used.
