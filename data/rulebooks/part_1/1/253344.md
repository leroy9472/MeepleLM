## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Cthulhu: Death May Die*, 1–5 players control 2–5 investigators attempting to stop an ancient Elder One from fully manifesting into the world. Each game combines an Elder One box and an Episode box. The goal is twofold:
- Disrupt the cult’s ritual as defined by the Episode.
- Kill the Elder One after it has been summoned and made vulnerable.

Failure occurs if:
- An investigator dies or goes mad before the Elder One is summoned.
- All investigators die or go mad after the Elder One is summoned.
- The Progression token reaches the final (8th) space on the Summoning track.

### 2. Components
- **Story Board**: Includes the Summoning track and space for cards.
- **Elder One Box**: Contains Elder One figure, 4 Elder One Stage cards, Minions card, 8 Mythos cards, and special tokens.
- **Episode Box**: Contains Episode card, Monsters card, 8 Mythos cards, 15 Discovery cards, tokens, and map tiles.
- **Investigators**: 2–5 investigator boards and figures, each with unique signature skills.
- **Tokens**: Wound, stress, sanity, fire, staircase, tunnel, gate, starting space, and various scenario-specific tokens.
- **Dice**: Standard black dice (with success, elder sign, tentacle, blank) and green bonus dice (success, elder sign, blank only).
- **Cards**: Mythos cards (16 total), Discovery cards (15), and Insanity cards (1 per investigator).

### 3. Setup
1. Place the Story Board, tokens, and dice within reach.
2. Choose an Elder One. Place its figure on the starting space of the Summoning track. Place the Minions card on the Story Board. Set out its 8 Mythos cards and any tokens. Stack Elder One Stage cards faceup in order (Stage 1 on top).
3. Choose an Episode. Take its 8 Mythos cards, 15 Discovery cards, Episode card, and tokens. Place the Monsters card on the Story Board.
4. Remove all enemy figures shown on the Elder One Minions and Episode Monsters cards. Place initial enemies on the board as directed; keep others in reserve.
5. Assemble the map using tiles as instructed on the back of the Episode card. Place tokens and initial figures. Flip the Episode card faceup and place it on the Story Board.
6. Shuffle all 16 Mythos cards together into one facedown deck.
7. Shuffle the 15 Discovery cards into a facedown deck.
8. Each player selects 1 investigator (2 in solo). Attach a colored base to the figure and place it on the starting space.
9. Place 6 tentacle markers per investigator: 3 on the first level of each skill, 1 each on the leftmost spaces of the Wound, Stress, and Sanity tracks.
10. Shuffle Insanity cards and deal 1 to each investigator. Place it faceup near their board.
11. Randomly choose a starting player. That player takes the Mythos deck and begins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn follows this sequence:
1. **Take 3 Actions**: Choose any combination of Run, Attack, Rest (in Safe space only), Trade, or Episode-specific actions.
2. **Draw Mythos Card**: Draw and resolve the top Mythos card in order (Special Effects, then Summon Enemies). Keep Elder One Summoning symbols visible.
3. **Investigate or Fight!**:
   - **Safe Space**: Draw and resolve a Discovery card.
   - **Unsafe Space**: Each enemy in your space attacks you (in order of your choice).
4. **Resolve End of Turn**:
   A. Resolve non-Elder One end-of-turn effects.
   B. Resolve Fire: Roll 1 die per Fire token on you; successes cause wounds, tentacles cause sanity loss. Discard all Fire tokens.
   C. Check Mythos Discard Pile: If 3 Elder One Summoning symbols are visible (or 1 card with 3 symbols), advance the Elder One/Progression token, resolve effects, then reshuffle the Mythos deck.
   D. Check Elder One Summoning: If Elder One entered a red space or ritual was disrupted, summon it to the board (move Stage 1 aside, reveal Stage 2, place Progression token).
   E. Resolve Elder One End of Turn Effects: In order (Stage 1 → 2 → 3 → Final), apply effects that refer to “you” (current investigator).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Movement**:
  - Run: Move up to 3 spaces. Passages require arrows on both sides. Staircases/tunnels connect matching tokens.
  - When leaving a space with enemies, all enemies follow.
  - Leaving a space with Fire tokens places 1 Fire token per space token onto your board.
- **Attacking**:
  - Target one enemy. Roll 3 black dice (+ bonus dice). Each success inflicts 1 wound.
  - Excess wounds beyond health are lost.
  - Brawling allows targeting multiple figures.
- **Rerolls**: Spend 1 stress to reroll 1 die (any roll, including enemy attacks). Can be used repeatedly until stress is maxed.
- **Sanity**:
  - Each tentacle rolled costs 1 sanity.
  - At Insanity Thresholds (🟫), stop, activate Insanity card, then level up 1 skill. Some thresholds grant +1 permanent bonus die to all rolls.
  - Sanity cannot be regained.
- **Stress & Wounds**:
  - Stress: Spend to reroll; maxed stress blocks rerolls and stress-based effects.
  - Wounds: Tracked on Wound track. Skull = death.
  - Rest: In Safe space, heal up to 3 total stress/wounds (any combo). Can be done multiple times per turn.
- **Discovery Cards**:
  - Draw when in Safe space (if deck not empty).
  - Claim Items, Companions, or Conditions by sliding under investigator board.
  - Companions: Absorb wounds (count as you taking them), grant skills. Die at max wounds.
  - Use un-timed Discovery effects anytime during your turn, except during other card/effect/resolution.
- **Dice Results (in order)**:
  1. Apply Successes (wounds or meet roll target).
  2. Resolve roll-tied effects.
  3. Apply Tentacles (sanity loss; trigger Insanity Threshold if reached).
- **Bonus Dice**:
  - From skills, cards, or Insanity Thresholds.
  - Only on investigator-initiated rolls (not enemy attacks or Fire rolls).
  - No limit; green dice have no tentacles.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: Defeat the Final Stage of the Elder One.
- **Lose Conditions**:
  - Any investigator dies or goes mad before Elder One is summoned.
  - All investigators die or go mad after Elder One is summoned.
  - Progression token reaches the 8th space.
- **Tie Resolution**: If win and lose conditions occur simultaneously, win takes precedence (e.g., last investigator and Elder One die at same time → win).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Enemy Definitions**:
  - Enemies = Cultists, Monsters, Elder One.
  - Monsters = non-Cultist, non-Elder One enemies.
  - Tokens (e.g., guards) are not enemies.
- **Summoning**:
  - Elder One summoned when entering first red space OR ritual disrupted.
  - Progression token replaces Elder One figure on track after summoning.
- **Elder One Combat**:
  - Cannot be attacked until ritual is disrupted.
  - Each Stage has separate health; excess wounds do not carry over.
  - All revealed Stage effects and dice remain in play.
  - Defeating a Stage counts as “killing an enemy.”
- **Death of Investigator**:
  - If before summoning → immediate loss.
  - If after summoning → discard all cards/tokens; continue.
  - If during turn → skip remaining phases except Mythos discard check.
- **Fire**:
  - Only extinguished if Episode allows.
  - If out of Fire tokens, use wound token for investigator; ignore for board.
- **Simultaneous Effects**: Resolved in player’s chosen order.
- **Component Limits**: Use only components from selected boxes; do not mix between scenarios.
