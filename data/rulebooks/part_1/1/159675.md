# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In Fields of Arle, players take on the roles of farmers in the East Frisian village of Arle during a period of agricultural prosperity. The region is famed for its fertile land, particularly suitable for flax cultivation. Players develop their farms by building dikes, reclaiming land, breeding livestock, cultivating fields, cutting peat, and running trade operations. The goal is to accumulate the most Victory Points (VP) over nine half-years (4.5 game years) through efficient resource management, strategic building, and diversified economic activity.

   - 1 Storage Board with Travel Destination Tiles face-up
   - 1 Harbour Board
   - 3 Wood, 3 Clay, 3 Peat, 3 Tea

## 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 9 alternating Summer and Winter half-years. Each half-year has three phases:

### Phase 1: Preparations
- Place 4 Workers (one per month: July–Oct for Summer, Jan–Apr for Winter) on the board, with the current Starting Player’s Workers on top.

### Phase 2: Work Phase
- Players take turns placing one Worker on an unoccupied Action Space of the current season.
- Once per half-year, a player may use an Action from the opposite season. Doing so transfers the Starting Player Marker to the opponent for the next half-year.
- If no one uses the Special Action, the Starting Player Marker passes to the player in 2nd place.
- Players may perform Anytime Actions during this phase.

### Phase 3: Inventorying
**After Summer (November):**
1. Empty Vehicles: Move Timber, Bricks, and Clothing to supply; place Travel Destination Tiles on the Travel Experience Track.
2. Receive Food from Cattle (1/2/3 for 1/3/5) and Sheep (1/2/3 for 2/5/7), max 6 total.
3. Harvest: 1 Grain per Grain Field, 1 Flax per Flax Field, 1 Wood per Forest.
4. Sustenance: Pay 3 Food and 2 Peat.
   - Substitute: Grain for missing Food; Wood/Timber for missing Peat.
   - Unpaid: -2 VP per missing item.

**After Winter (May):**
1. Empty Vehicles: Same as above.
2. Animal Reproduction:
   - Stalls: 2 animals → +1; Double Stall = 2 separate Stalls.
   - Stables: 2, 3, or 5 animals → +1; 4 animals → +2.
3. Shearing: 1/2/3 Wool for 1/4/6 Sheep.
4. Sustenance: Pay 3 Food.
   - Substitute: Grain or Animal for missing Food.
   - Unpaid: -2 VP per missing Food.

After Inventorying, advance the Half-Year Counter. The game ends after the 9th half-year.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Dike Building
- Dike tiles form a horizontal line (Dike Line) separating Mainland (buildable) from Tidal Flat (flooded).
- Move Dikes upward to reclaim land: each completed horizontal line of 3 Dikes unlocks 3 new Land Spaces.
- Only one Dike may connect to the Dike Line at a time.

### Ditch Digging
- First Ditch must connect to the Dike Line.
- Subsequent Ditches must connect to at least one other Ditch.
- Ditches cannot be placed above the Dike Line or on Dike tiles.
- Once placed, Ditches are permanent.
- If the Dike Line moves and disconnects the Ditch network, the player may dig 1 Ditch for free to reconnect.

### Using Ditches
- A Land Space bordered by at least 2 Ditches is "Dehydrated."
- Benefits:
  - Holds up to 3 Sheep.
  - Farmer Action: Plow 2 Fields per Plow on dehydrated land.
  - Dehydrates adjacent Moor Tiles (flip and add 4 Peat).

### Animal Husbandry
- **Stall**: 3 animals of same type.
- **Stable**: 6 animals of same type.
- **Double Stall**: 2 separate Stalls.
- **Dike**: 1 animal of any type.
- **Park**: 2 animals of any or different types.
- **Empty Land Space**: 2 animals of same type.
- **Dehydrated Land Space**: 3 Sheep.

### Tea and East Frisian Tea
- Pay 1 Tea to enhance an Action as if Tool were 1 space higher (not for Oven).
- Pay 1 East Frisian Tea to enhance Tool by 2 spaces (1 space for Oven).
- Pay 2 East Frisian Tea to take an Action twice (pay cost twice).
- Only one Tea/East Frisian Tea may be used per Action.
- Cannot improve past end of Tool track.

### Anytime Actions (during Work Phase)
- Load Vehicles with Building Materials or Fabrics to upgrade them (pay 1 Peat to turn Clay → Brick).
- Load Land Vehicles with Travel Destination tiles (immediately sell goods for Food).
- Use Peat Boats to exchange Peat for Goods 1:1.
- Use Green Small House Buildings (unlimited use).

## 6. Scoring & End Game
After the 9th Inventorying Phase, score VP as follows:

1. **Goods Tiles**: Bricks, Linen, Woolen, Leather = 1 VP each; Summer/Winter/Leather Wear = 2 VP each; Timber = 0.5 VP each.
2. **Equipment**: Sum VP of Vehicles, Plows, Peat Boats; -3 VP if no Large Vehicle.
3. **Travel Experience Track**: First empty space (from bottom) = VP value (max 10 VP).
4. **Tools**: Sum VP from all 10 Tool Tracks.
5. **Goods Track**: 
   - Space 15 = 3 VP
   - Spaces 11–14 = 2 VP
   - Spaces 7–10 = 1 VP
   - If Depot owned: Double total (only once).
6. **Home Board**: Sum VP from Buildings, Stalls, Stables, Forests, Parks; subtract:
   - 4 VP per hydrated Moor
   - 1 VP per dehydrated Moor
   - 1 VP per remaining Tidal Flat Space
7. **Animals**:
   - 2 VP per animal of type you have least of
   - 1 VP per animal of type you have second least of
   - 0 VP for most numerous type
8. **Unpaid Items**: -2 VP per unpaid Food or Peat from Inventorying Phases.

**Winning**: Highest VP wins. Tiebreaker: Player who would be Starting Player in a hypothetical 10th half-year.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Vehicle Loading**: Single spaces can hold Wood, Clay (→ Timber/Brick), or small Travel Destinations (Hage, Dornum, Beemoor). Double spaces cannot hold Wood/Clay or small tiles.
- **Travel Destinations**: Must be used immediately when loaded: sell at least one item for Food. Items can only be sold once. Cannot use goods from other vehicles.
- **Peat Boat Trade**: Can exchange Peat for any Goods at 1:1, even after game ends (if Peat Boat owned).
- **Tool Movement**: When using Master Action, you may move different Tool Indicators up to the number of Workbenches you have. Cannot move the same Tool twice.
- **Dike Movement**: Only Dike Builder (Summer) and Dike Warden (Winter) can move Dikes. Pairs of Shovels determine how many Dikes can be moved.
- **Animal Reproduction**: Only animals in Stalls and Stables reproduce. Newborns count for Wool collection immediately.
