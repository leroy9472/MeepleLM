### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the roles of Mayan tribes competing to develop their civilization through resource gathering, technological advancement, building construction, and appeasing the gods. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VP) by the end of the game, which occurs after one full revolution of the central Tzolk’in gear (26 turns). Victory is determined by final scoring of resources, monuments, and temple standings.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with central Tzolk’in gear (26 teeth) connected to 5 smaller gears:  
  - Palenque (jungle harvesting)  
  - Yaxchilan (resource gathering)  
  - Tikal (technology & construction)  
  - Uxmal (market & offerings)  
  - Chichen Itza (temple offerings)  
- 65 corn tiles (values 1 and 5)  
- 30 wood, 18 stone, 20 gold resource blocks  
- 13 crystal skulls  
- 24 workers (6 per player, 4 colors)  
- 28 player markers (7 per player)  
- 4 two-sided player boards  
- 4 scoring counters  
- 21 Starting Wealth tiles  
- 13 Monuments (yellow-backed)  
- 32 Buildings (14 Age 1 red-backed, 18 Age 2 brown-backed)  
- 1 Starting Player Marker (mask)  
- Plastic fasteners and stickers for gear assembly  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Assemble Board**: Attach gears using fasteners; apply stickers to Tzolk’in gear (4 food day markers).  
2. **Rotate Tzolk’in Gear**: Align arrow with a blue-green "End of Age" tooth.  
3. **Place Resources**:  
   - Corn in center of Tzolk’in gear.  
   - Wood, stone, gold, skulls in supply.  
4. **Jungle (Palenque)**:  
   - Place 1 Corn Harvest Tile on each field (spaces 2–5).  
   - On spaces 3–5, stack a Wood Harvest Tile atop each Corn Tile.  
   - For 3P: Use 3 fields per space; 2P: Use 2 fields per space.  
5. **Buildings & Monuments**:  
   - Deal 6 Age 1 Buildings face-up.  
   - Deal 6 Monuments face-up (5 in 3P, 4 in 2P).  
6. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player takes:  
     - 1 player board (light side up)  
     - 3 workers  
     - 7 markers (1 on each tech track start; 1 on each temple base)  
     - 1 scoring counter (on 0)  
     - 4 Starting Wealth tiles (drawn secretly)  
   - Each chooses 2 of 4 Starting Wealth tiles to keep; discard others. Apply bonuses immediately (resources, techs, temple advances, etc.).  
7. **Dummy Workers (2P/3P only)**:  
   - Shuffle remaining Starting Wealth tiles.  
   - Draw one at a time; place a dummy worker (non-player color) on the indicated gear space.  
   - If first dummy on a gear, place a second on the opposite space (except Chichen Itza).  
   - Continue until: 6 dummies (3P), 12 dummies (2P).  
   - Dummies remain for the entire game and block spaces.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:  
1. **Player Turns** (clockwise)  
2. **Food Day** (only on marked turns)  
3. **Advance the Calendar**  

#### Player Turn  
At the start of your turn:  
- **Optional: Beg for Corn**  
  - If you have ≤2 corn, you may discard all corn and take 3 from supply.  
  - This angers the gods: move down 1 step on any one temple.  
  - If you have no workers on gears and cannot afford to place a worker, you must beg (if possible).  

Then, choose **one** action:  

**A. Place Worker(s)**  
- Must have at least one available worker.  
- Choose a gear; place worker on the **lowest unoccupied space**.  
- Pay cost:  
  - Corn equal to the sum of the action space numbers.  
  - Additional corn based on **total number of workers placed this turn** (see player board).  
- Starting Player Space costs 0 but counts for placement cost.  
- Cannot place more workers than you can afford.  
- Cannot place 0 workers.  

**B. Pick Up Worker(s)**  
- Must have at least one worker on gears.  
- Remove one or more workers. For each:  
  - Perform the action where the worker stands, OR  
  - Pay 1 corn per step back to perform a lower action (even if occupied), OR  
  - Do nothing.  
- **Free Choice Actions** (Palenque 6–7, Yaxchilan 6, Tikal 6, Uxmal 6, Chichen Itza 10):  
  - When picking up from these, perform **any action** on that gear at no extra cost.  

**End of Turn**  
- If you constructed a building, refill the space with a new building from the current Age stack.  
- If you placed a worker on the Starting Player Space, take all corn accumulated on the Tzolk’in gear.  

#### Food Day (Occurs 4 times)  
Happens when the Tzolk’in gear arrow points to a food day tooth.  
1. **Feed Workers**  
   - Pay 2 corn per worker in play (on board or in personal supply).  
   - Lose 3 VP per unfed worker. VP can go negative.  
   - Farm buildings reduce feeding cost.  
2. **Change Buildings (End of Age 1 only)**  
   - After feeding, remove all remaining Age 1 buildings.  
   - Deal 6 Age 2 buildings.  
3. **Take Temple Rewards**  
   - **Middle of Age (Brown-Orange Days)**:  
     - Gain all resources and skulls shown on your current temple step **and all steps below**.  
     - If not enough skulls, **no one** gets a skull.  
   - **End of Age (Blue-Green Days)**:  
     - Gain VP shown on your current temple step.  
     - Highest player on each temple gets bonus VP (shown above temple).  
     - If tied, all tied players get half the bonus.  
     - Lower-left bonus is for Age 1; upper-right for Age 2.  

#### Advance the Calendar  
- Rotate Tzolk’in gear **1 day counter-clockwise**.  
- Workers on highest-numbered spaces (7 on most gears, 10 on Chichen Itza) are **pushed off** and returned to owners (no action).  
- **If no worker on Starting Player Space**:  
  - Place 1 corn on current tooth.  
- **If worker on Starting Player Space**:  
  - Retrieve worker immediately.  
  - Take or pass Starting Player Marker:  
    - If not current start player, take it.  
    - If already start player, pass to left.  
  - **Optional: Advance 2 days** if:  
    - Your player board is light side up.  
    - The second advance would **not** push any worker off a gear.  
    - If used, flip board to dark side.  
  - Skipping a food day this way does **not** skip the food day—it occurs next round.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Worker Placement**: Workers advance gears automatically; must place on lowest available space.  
- **Resource Types**:  
  - Resources: Wood, Stone, Gold (used for techs/buildings).  
  - Corn: Currency and food.  
  - Crystal Skulls: Limited (13); used for Chichen Itza actions and scoring.  
- **Angering the Gods**:  
  - Occurs when:  
    - Burning forest (discard wood to get corn on Palenque 3–5).  
    - Begging for corn.  
  - Effect: Move down 1 step on any one temple.  
  - Cannot do if already on bottom of all temples.  
- **Temple Advancement**:  
  - Ways to climb:  
    - Starting tiles  
    - Chichen Itza actions (deposit skull)  
    - Uxmal 1 (pay 3 corn)  
    - Tikal 5 (pay 1 resource)  
    - Building/tech bonuses  
  - Top space allows only **one player**.  
  - Reaching the top flips player board to **light side**, restoring 2-day advance ability.  
- **Technologies** (4 tracks: Agriculture, Resource Extraction, Architecture, Theology):  
  - Advance via Tikal 1 or 3.  
  - Cost: 1, 2, 3 blocks to reach levels 1, 2, 3.  
  - Level 4+ (repeatable): Pay 1 block for one-time bonus.  
  - Bonuses are cumulative.  
- **Buildings**:  
  - Construct via Tikal 2/4 or Uxmal 4.  
  - Immediate or ongoing effects (e.g., farms reduce feeding cost).  
  - Replenished from current Age stack.  
  - Age 1 → Age 2 at midpoint.  
- **Monuments**:  
  - Construct via Tikal 4 (choose monument instead of buildings).  
  - Not replenished.  
  - Score at end game based on tile effect.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End**: After the 4th Food Day (full gear rotation).  
**Final Scoring**:  
1. **Convert Resources to Corn** (market rate):  
   - Wood → 2 Corn  
   - Stone → 3 Corn  
   - Gold → 4 Corn  
2. **Convert Corn to VP**: 4 Corn = 1 VP  
3. **Crystal Skulls**: 3 VP each  
4. **Monuments**: Score VP as per tile effects  
5. **Sum all VP**  

**Tiebreaker**:  
1. Most workers on gears.  
2. If still tied, all tied players win.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can VP go negative?** Yes. Losing 3 VP per unfed worker can result in negative score.  
- **Begging with no temple room?** If on bottom of all temples and must beg, you cannot. If you have no workers on board and can't place, you may place 1 worker on cheapest space and lose all corn.  
- **Chichen Itza actions**: Each can be used only once (require skull). Cannot reuse if skull is gone.  
- **Free Choice Actions**: Can perform any action on the gear, including lower-cost ones, at no extra corn.  
- **Starting Player Space**: Corn taken can be used for feeding that round, but not for placement.  
- **2-Day Advance**: Cannot push a worker off a gear solely due to the second day. If worker is on space 6, advancing 2 days would push it off—invalid. If on space 7, it would be pushed off anyway—allowed.  
- **Temple Ties**: At end of age, tied highest players each get **half** the bonus VP (round down if odd).
