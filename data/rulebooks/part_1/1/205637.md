# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a cooperative Living Card Game set in the Lovecraftian universe. Players take on the roles of investigators battling eldritch horrors and unraveling dark conspiracies. The objective varies by scenario but generally involves advancing the Act deck to a favorable resolution by gathering clues and overcoming challenges, while preventing the Agenda deck from advancing to a negative outcome.

## 2. Components
- Investigator cards
- Player decks (assets, events, skills)
- Encounter deck (enemies, treacheries, locations)
- Agenda and Act decks
- Chaos bag with chaos tokens
- Tokens: resources, damage, horror, clues, doom
- Mini cards for investigators and enemies
- Location cards
- Scenario reference card

## 3. Setup
1. Choose a scenario and follow setup instructions in the Campaign Guide.
2. Each player chooses an investigator and builds a legal deck (exact size, max 2 copies per card, observe deckbuilding requirements).
3. Campaign only: Spend XP to purchase new cards, record unspent XP, apply trauma from previous scenarios.
4. Choose a Lead Investigator.
5. Assemble token pools (resources, damage, horror, clues/doom).
6. Construct the chaos bag according to scenario or campaign rules.
7. Each investigator:
   - Receives 5 resources
   - Plays "permanent" cards
   - Draws 5 cards (redraw any weakness cards)
   - Takes one mulligan (1–5 cards)
8. Set up scenario:
   - Place locations, agenda/act decks, encounter deck
   - Reveal starting location and place investigators
   - Place initial clues as instructed

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds through four phases:

### I. Mythos Phase (skip in Round 1)
1. Place 1 doom on the current agenda.
2. Check doom threshold: if total doom ≥ threshold, advance the agenda deck and remove all doom from play.
3. Each investigator draws 1 encounter card in player order.

### II. Investigation Phase
- Investigators take turns in any order.
- Each investigator has 3 actions per turn.
- Actions may be repeated and taken in any order.
- If engaged with a ready enemy, actions other than Fight, Evade, Parley, or Resign trigger an Attack of Opportunity.
- After each investigator completes their turn, flip their minicard to indicate completion.

### III. Enemy Phase
1. **Hunter Movement**: Ready, unengaged enemies with the Hunter keyword move one space toward the nearest investigator. If multiple equidistant, Lead Investigator chooses. If entering a location with investigators, they engage one (Lead Investigator chooses if conflict).
2. **Enemy Attacks**: Each ready, engaged enemy attacks the investigator it is engaged with. Resolve attacks in player order. Deal damage and horror simultaneously. Exhaust enemy after attack.

### IV. Upkeep Phase
1. Reset actions: flip investigator minicards to active side.
2. Ready all exhausted cards. Unengaged enemies at a location with an investigator immediately engage.
3. Each investigator draws 1 card and gains 1 resource.
4. Each investigator discards down to hand limit (8 cards).

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Available Actions (during Investigation Phase)
- **Move**: Move to connected location. First time entering: reveal location and place clue tokens equal to its clue value. Engaged enemies move with investigator.
- **Draw**: Draw 1 card. If deck empty, reshuffle discard pile and take 1 horror.
- **Resource**: Gain 1 resource.
- **Play**: Play an asset or event from hand by paying cost. Assets occupy slots (1 ally, 1 body, 1 accessory, 2 hand, 2 arcane). Exceeding limits requires discarding assets.
- **Activate**: Resolve an → ability on a card in play (controlled card, location, threat area, act/agenda).
- **Investigate**: Test Intellect vs. location's shroud. Success: gain 1 clue.
- **Fight**: Attack an enemy at your location. Test Combat vs. enemy’s fight value. Success: deal 1 damage. If failed and enemy engaged with another investigator, deal damage to that investigator.
- **Evade**: Evade one enemy engaged with you. Test Agility vs. enemy’s evade value. Success: exhaust enemy and move it to location (break engagement).
- **Engage**: Place an enemy at your location into your threat area (even if engaged with another investigator).

### Keywords
- **Aloof**: Does not automatically engage. Must use Engage action to fight.
- **Fast**: Does not cost an action to play. Cannot trigger Attacks of Opportunity.
- **Hunter**: Moves toward nearest investigator during Enemy Phase.
- **Massive**: Engages all investigators at its location when ready. Attacks each engaged investigator separately. Exhausted = not engaged.
- **Peril**: While resolving, no assistance from other players (no card plays, ability triggers, or card commitments).
- **Surge**: After resolving, draw another encounter card.
- **Unique (*)**: Only one instance of each unique card (by title) may be in play.
- **Retaliate**: If ready, performs an attack against an investigator who fails a skill test while attacking it. Does not exhaust.
- **Spawn**: Enemy enters play at specified location or engaged with drawer if no instruction.
- **Uses (X)**: Place X resource tokens of specified type on card when it enters play. Spend tokens to use abilities.

### Skill Tests
1. Determine skill type (Willpower, Intellect, Combat, Agility).
2. Commit cards from hand with matching icons (+1 per icon). Wild (?) icons match any skill. Each other investigator at location may commit 1 card.
3. Reveal chaos token from chaos bag.
4. Apply chaos symbol effect (refer to scenario reference card).
5. Calculate modified skill: base + modifiers + committed cards + chaos effect.
6. Compare to difficulty:
   - Success: modified skill ≥ difficulty (or auto-success effect)
   - Failure: modified skill < difficulty (or auto-fail effect)
7. Apply test results in investigator’s chosen order.
8. Discard committed cards and return chaos token to bag.

### Enemy Engagement
- Enemies are either engaged (in threat area) or unengaged (at location).
- Ready, unengaged enemies automatically engage investigators at their location.
- Lead Investigator chooses engagement target if multiple options.
- Prey instructions override normal engagement if conflict.

### Damage & Horror
- Assign damage to investigator or assets with health.
- Assign horror to investigator or assets with sanity.
- If damage ≥ health or horror ≥ sanity, card is defeated.
- Defeated investigator is eliminated. Clues dropped at location. In campaign, suffer trauma.

### Advancing Decks
- **Act Deck**: Spend group clues equal to current act’s value. No action required. Can be done any time.
- **Agenda Deck**: Advance when total doom in play ≥ current agenda’s threshold.
- To advance: remove all tokens, flip card, follow instructions, remove from play. Next card becomes current.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- Victory is scenario-dependent, usually by advancing Act deck to a favorable resolution.
- Defeat occurs if Agenda deck advances to a negative resolution or all investigators are eliminated.
- Encounter cards with →R# trigger resolution; consult Campaign Guide.
- If all investigators are eliminated, use "if no resolution was reached" outcome.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Attack of Opportunity**: Triggered when engaged with ready enemy and taking non-combat action. Enemies attack but do not exhaust.
- **Massive Enemies**: Engage all investigators. Attacks resolved one at a time (Lead Investigator chooses order). Attack of Opportunity only affects provoking investigator.
- **Retaliate**: Triggers after failed attack test, even if enemy not engaged. Does not exhaust.
- **Hidden Cards**: Added secretly to hand. Count toward hand size. Only controller can trigger abilities.
- **Mulligan**: One allowed during setup. Set aside 1–5 cards, draw replacements, shuffle originals into deck.
- **Grim Rule**: In case of ambiguity, resolve in the way most detrimental to players.
