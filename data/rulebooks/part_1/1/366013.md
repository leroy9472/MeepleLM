## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
This expansion, "Collision Course," introduces realistic collision mechanics to *HEAT: Pedal to the Metal*, reflecting the dangers of early 20th-century racing where collisions were rare but potentially fatal. The core objective remains unchanged: complete the required number of laps and cross the finish line first. However, this module adds risk during overtaking maneuvers, especially when passing two cars in the same space, which may trigger collisions involving the overtaking player and/or Legend (AI) cars.

Collisions occur based on Speed card values (for players) or Diamond values (for Legends). The rules simulate the chaos of close racing, punishing aggressive moves that misfire.

### 2. Components
- Player cars, player mats, gear pawns
- Speed cards (values 1–4), Stress cards, Heat cards
- Upgrade cards (Regular and Advanced)
- Legend cars and Legend cards (each with a Top Speed and Diamond value 0–3)
- Malfunction cards (only if using *Heat Crash* rules)
- Coins or markers (to track Legend damage)

*Note: Malfunction cards are only used if playing with the "Heat Crash" ruleset. If not, collisions are treated as Spin Outs.*

### 3. Setup
- Set up the base game of *HEAT: Pedal to the Metal*, including track, player positions, decks, and starting hands.
- Include Legend cars if using the Legends module. Place them randomly on the grid.
- Shuffle the Legend deck and place it face down.
- Prepare damage markers (e.g., coins) for tracking Legend collisions.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Shift Gears** – All players simultaneously choose gear.
2. **Play Cards** – Play number of cards equal to current gear.
3. **Reveal & Move** – Reveal cards, calculate speed, move.
4. **Adrenaline** – Last (or last two) players gain +1 Speed and/or +1 Cooldown.
5. **React** – Resolve Boost, Cooldown, and card symbols.
6. **Slipstream** – Optional 2-space move if adjacent or behind another car.
7. **Check Corner** – Pay Heat if speed exceeds limit; Spin Out if unable.
8. **Discard** – Optional discard of non-Heat/Stress cards.
9. **Replenish Hand** – Draw back to 7 cards.

**Collision Trigger**: When a player overtakes two cars in the same space (via speed or slipstream), a collision check occurs.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Collision During Overtaking Two Cars
- When a player overtakes two cars in the same space, **all three players** (overtaker + two overtaken) draw one card from their deck.
- **Stress Card Drawn**: The player’s car is damaged (partially leaves track). Take a Malfunction card and place it on top of the Stress card in the discard pile. If no Malfunction cards remain, the player **crashes**.
- **Speed Cards Drawn**: Compare values.
  - If two or more players have **identical Speed values**, their cars **collide**.
  - Each involved player takes a Malfunction card and places it on top of their Speed card in the discard pile.
  - If no Malfunction cards remain, the player **crashes**.
- **If a player crashes**:
  - **Overtaking player**: Move ends in the next available space behind the overtaken cars.
  - **Overtaken player**: Gear resets to 1st; position unchanged.
- **If no crash, but damage occurs**: Speed and gear unaffected. Overtaker completes move normally.

#### Multiple Occupied Spaces
- If a player passes multiple fully occupied spaces, resolve collision checks **independently**, starting with the rearmost.
- If the player **crashes** during one check, they do not proceed to later spaces.

#### Collisions with Legends
- A player may collide with a Legend when overtaking two cars in the same space, one of which is a Legend.
- Compare the **player’s Speed card** with the **Legend’s Diamond value** (0–3).
- **No value 4 in Diamonds**: A player drawing a Speed card with value 4 **does not collide** with a Legend.
- **Legend vs. Legend Collision**: Two Legends collide if their drawn cards show **identical numbers**, including 0.
- **Legend collision result**: The Legend receives a **damage marker**.

#### Handling Collisions Without "Heat Crash" Rules
If *Heat Crash* rules are **not used**:
- Treat every collision or track-exit damage as a **Spin Out**.
- **Overtaking car** ends behind the cars it tried to pass.
- Take **Stress cards** equal to the gear used during the collision.
- Move **Gear pawn to 1st gear**.
- If hand is full, place excess Stress cards on top of discard pile.
- Legends involved in collisions receive a **damage marker**.
- A Legend eliminated after **more than three collisions**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Standard *HEAT* win condition: First player to cross the finish line after required laps wins.
- **No scoring changes** from base game.
- **Legend elimination** does not affect victory; it only removes AI opponents from play.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a player collide with a Legend using Speed 4?**  
  No. Legends have no Diamond value 4, so a Speed 4 card cannot match.

- **Do Stress cards cause collisions?**  
  No. Only Speed cards (and their values) are compared for collisions.

- **What if multiple collision checks occur in one turn?**  
  Resolve each independently, in order from rearmost to frontmost. Stop if a crash occurs.

- **Can a Legend cause a crash without Malfunction cards?**  
  No. Without *Heat Crash*, Legend collisions only apply damage markers.

- **Is slipstreaming involved in collision checks?**  
  Yes. Overtaking two cars via slipstream triggers the same collision rules.

- **What happens if a player cannot take Stress cards due to hand limit?**  
  Excess Stress cards are placed on top of the discard pile.

- **How is damage tracked on Legends?**  
  Place a coin or marker beneath the Gear pawn, or use any visible method.

- **Can a Legend be "spun out"?**  
  No. Legends never spin out, slipstream, or use Heat/Cooldown. They only move based on their card and position relative to the Legends Line and corners.
