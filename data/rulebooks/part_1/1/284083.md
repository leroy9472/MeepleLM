## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine*, players are astronauts on a cooperative mission to discover the mysterious ninth planet at the edge of the solar system. The game consists of 50 unique missions, each with specific objectives. The crew wins a mission only if all assigned tasks are completed successfully by the correct players. The game is fully cooperative — all players win or lose together.

2. Components  
- 40 Large Cards:  
  - 36 Color cards (1–9) in four suits: Pink, Blue, Green, Yellow  
  - 4 Rocket cards (1–4) — act as trump  
- 36 Small Task Cards: miniature versions of color cards, indicating target cards to win  
- 10 Task Tokens: indicate order constraints (1st, 2nd, ..., last, before, after)  
- 5 Radio Communication Tokens: used for limited signaling  
- 5 Reminder Cards: track communicated cards  
- 1 Distress Signal Token: face-down at start, can be activated to pass cards  
- 1 Commander Token: given to player holding Rocket #4  
- 1 Rulebook / Logbook: contains all 50 missions, scoring, and symbols  

3. Setup  
1. Choose a mission from the logbook.  
2. Shuffle the 40 large cards and deal them face down equally among players:  
   - 3 players: one player gets an extra card (left unplayed at the end)  
3. Each player receives:  
   - 1 Radio Communication Token (green side up)  
   - 1 Reminder Card  
4. Place the Distress Signal Token face down.  
5. Shuffle the 36 task cards into a face-down deck.  
6. Determine the Commander:  
   - The player holding Rocket #4 takes the Commander Token.  
7. Prepare tasks based on the mission:  
   - Draw specified number of task cards face up.  
   - If task tokens are used, place them face up in order, left to right.  
   - Assign task cards to tokens in left-to-right order.  
8. Assign tasks:  
   - Commander chooses first task card (and matching token if applicable).  
   - Remaining players take turns clockwise until all tasks are assigned.  
   - Each player takes the task card and its associated token (if any).  
9. If no tasks are used in the mission, the Commander starts the first trick immediately.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. (Optional) Activate Distress Signal:  
   - Before the first trick, crew may activate the Distress Signal.  
   - All players pass one card (not a Rocket) to a neighbor (all left or all right).  
   - Flip token to active side; log use (+1 to attempt count).  
   - Remains active for all future attempts of the same mission.  
2. Commander starts the first trick.  
3. Trick Play:  
   - Players play clockwise.  
   - First card played sets the suit.  
   - Players must follow suit if able.  
   - If unable to follow, any card may be played.  
   - Rocket cards may only be played if player cannot follow suit, or if Rocket is led.  
   - Trick is won by:  
     - Highest Rocket, if any Rockets are played.  
     - Otherwise, highest card of the led suit.  
   - Winner collects trick, places it facedown.  
   - Winner leads next trick.  
4. Communication:  
   - After tasks are assigned, any player may use their Radio Communication Token once per mission.  
   - Place a color card (not Rocket) face up.  
   - Place token on it:  
     - Top: highest card of that suit  
     - Middle: only card of that suit  
     - Bottom: lowest card of that suit  
   - Add reminder card to hand.  
   - After playing the communicated card, discard reminder and flip token to red.  
5. Repeat until:  
   - All tasks are completed → Win  
   - A task card is won by wrong player → Lose  
   - A task token condition is violated → Lose  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Trick-Taking Rules:**  
  - Must follow suit if able.  
  - Rockets are trump and win unless a higher Rocket is played.  
  - Only cards of led suit (or Rockets) can win.  
- **Communication Rules:**  
  - One use per player per mission.  
  - Cannot communicate Rockets.  
  - Card must meet communicated condition (high, only, low).  
  - Token placement is permanent.  
- **Task Fulfillment:**  
  - A task is completed when the assigned player wins a trick containing the specified card.  
  - Multiple tasks may be completed in one trick.  
  - Completed task cards are turned face down.  
- **Task Tokens (Order Constraints):**  
  - Numbered tokens (1–5): task must be completed in exact order.  
  - Arrow tokens (>, >>, >>>, >>>>, Ω): indicate relative order (before/after).  
  - If multiple tasks with consecutive numbered tokens are completed in one trick, they are considered valid.  
  - Violating order → immediate loss.  
- **Special Mission Rules:**  
  - **Dead Zone:** Communication allowed, but token is placed red-side up next to card (no indication of high/only/low).  
  - **Disruption:** No communication until specified trick (e.g., "3" = first allowed before trick 3).  
  - **Commander’s Decision:** Tasks are face down; Commander asks each player "yes/no" if willing to take all tasks; assigns all to one player (not self).  
  - **Commander’s Distribution:** Tasks revealed one at a time; Commander asks each player "yes/no" interest; assigns each task (may self-assign); tasks must be evenly distributed (no player has 2+ more than another).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Mission ends immediately when:  
  - All tasks are completed → Success  
  - Wrong player wins a task card → Failure  
  - Task order violated → Failure  
- On success:  
  - Record number of attempts in logbook.  
  - If Distress Signal was used, add +1 to attempt count.  
- On failure:  
  - Reshuffle all cards and task cards.  
  - Redo mission with new card and task distribution.  
- Game progresses through 50 missions. Completion of all is the ultimate goal.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you look at old tricks?**  
  Only the most recently won trick may be viewed. All others are facedown and private.  
- **Can Rockets be passed via Distress Signal?**  
  No. Rocket cards cannot be passed under any circumstances.  
- **What if a player has no cards of the led suit?**  
  They may play any card, including a Rocket (if not led, only if no suit match).  
- **Can you win a trick with a Rocket if you could have followed suit?**  
  No. Rockets can only be played when unable to follow suit, or when Rocket is led.  
- **What happens in a 3-player game with the extra card?**  
  One player has 14 cards; the last card remains unplayed after the final trick.  
- **Can you use communication before tasks are assigned?**  
  No. Communication is only allowed after tasks are distributed.  
- **What if a player completes multiple tasks with order tokens in one trick?**  
  If the tokens are consecutive (e.g., 1 and 2), they are considered completed in correct order.  
- **Can you decline to use Distress Signal even if active?**  
  Yes. Once activated, it remains active, but players may choose not to pass cards on subsequent attempts.
