### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Le Havre*, players are businessmen in the French harbor town of Le Havre during the 19th and 20th centuries. The goal is to amass the greatest wealth by acquiring and using buildings and ships to gather and convert resources, generate income, and efficiently manage food requirements. Players must balance short-term survival (feeding workers) with long-term investment (constructing valuable buildings and ships). Victory is determined by total wealth at the end of the game.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
A game consists of a fixed number of rounds (7 turns each), followed by a final stage.

#### Player Turn Sequence:
1. **Supply Action (Mandatory)**  
   - Move your ship marker to the next free supply tile (clockwise).  
   - If face-down, turn it face-up.  
   - Place 1 token of each resource shown on the tile onto the corresponding offer space (standard side up).  
   - If the tile says "Interest": All players with loans pay 1 Franc to the supply. If unable, must take a loan first, then pay.

2. **Main Action (Mandatory)**  
   Choose one:  
   - **Take Goods**: Take all tokens (resources or Francs) from one offer space.  
   - **Use a Building**:  
     - Move your person disc to an unoccupied building (owned by town or another player).  
     - Pay entry fee (food or Francs) to owner (or supply if town-owned). " / " means pay one option.  
     - Perform the building’s action.  
     - You cannot stay in your current building.

3. **Additional Actions (Optional, during your turn)**  
   - **Buy Buildings/Ships**:  
     - Buy any building owned by the town or on top of a Building Proposal pile.  
     - Price = value (top-left number) unless otherwise stated ("Cost").  
     - Buy topmost visible ship card (price listed below value).  
     - Ships can be bought even without a Wharf.  
   - **Sell Buildings/Ships**:  
     - Sell any owned building or ship to the town for half its value (round down if odd).  
     - Sold buildings go to town; sold ships go to top of respective ship pile.  
     - Any person disc in sold building returns to owner.  
     - Cannot sell and buy same building in same turn.  
   - **Repay Loans**: Pay 5 Francs per loan at any time.

#### End of Round (after 7th turn):
- **Harvest**: If Round card says "Harvest":  
  - Each player with ≥1 grain gains 1 grain.  
  - Each player with ≥2 cattle gains 1 cattle.  
- **Feeding Phase**:  
  - Each player pays food equal to cooking pot symbol on Round card.  
  - Each ship reduces required food by amount shown on its card.  
  - Pay with food tokens or Francs (1:1).  
  - If unable, must take a loan.  
- **Town Constructs a Building**:  
  - If symbol: Take lowest-sort-order building from Building Proposals.  
  - If symbol: Reveal top card of Special Buildings pile.  
- **New Ship Card**: Flip Round card to ship side; place on corresponding ship pile (Wooden, Iron, Steel, Luxury Liner).  
- **Next Round**: Next player begins with Supply Action on first supply tile.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Resource Upgrades**: Flip tokens to upgraded side using building actions (e.g., grain → bread in Bakehouse).  
- **Energy**: Required for some upgrades. Generated via:  
  - Wood (1 energy) → Charcoal (3 energy) at Charcoal Kiln  
  - Coal (3 energy) → Coke (10 energy) at Cokery  
  - 1 good → 1 charcoal at Business Office  
- **Building Construction**:  
  - Use Construction Firm or Building Firms to construct buildings from top of Building Proposals.  
  - Pay required resources (wood, clay, iron, etc.).  
  - Brick can substitute for clay; steel can substitute for iron.  
- **Ship Construction**:  
  - Use Wharf to build ships. Pay resources and 3 energy.  
  - First player to build non-Wooden ship at a Wharf must modernize it with 1 brick (permanent).  
  - Receive food production token for ship.  
- **Entry Fees**: Paid when using another player’s or town’s building. Paid in food or Francs. Own buildings are free.  
- **Rounding**: Always round against player (down for gains, up for costs).  
- **No Token Limits**: Supplies are unlimited. Use multiplier tokens if needed.  
- **Change**: Francs can be exchanged freely. No change for food or energy overpayment.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Final Stage**: After last Round card is resolved:  
  - Each player takes one final main action.  
  - Supply and Buy actions are not allowed.  
  - May move to an occupied building (only in final stage).  
  - May sell buildings/ships or repay loans.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - Sum values of all buildings and ships (top-left number).  
  - Add bonus values from buildings with "+" symbol (e.g., Bank, Town Hall).  
  - Add cash (Francs).  
  - If owning Storehouse: Add ½ Franc per goods token (round down).  
  - Subtract 7 Francs per unpaid loan.  
- **Winner**: Player with highest total wealth wins. Ties result in multiple winners.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use a building I just bought?** Yes, if you have an action remaining.  
- **Can I build a ship without a Wharf?** No. Ships must be built at a Wharf (but can be bought without one).  
- **Can I modernize a Wharf without building a ship?** No. Modernization only occurs when building a non-Wooden ship.  
- **Can I sell a building during another player’s turn?** Yes, unless they are in the middle of an action.  
- **Can I use my own building multiple times?** No. You must leave and re-enter (possibly in final stage).  
- **What if a Building Proposal pile is empty?** It remains empty. Only available buildings can be used.  
- **Can I pay entry fee with upgraded goods?** Yes, unless specified otherwise.  
- **Can I use Wind Farm discount on Wharf energy cost?** No. Wind Farm only applies to building actions, not ship construction energy.
