# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Each player leads a tribe striving to rebuild the world after the ice recedes. The goal is to score the most points by exploring lands, building structures, populating locations, collecting artifacts, and advancing technologies. The game ends when the last major artifact is taken. Players then score purple points from multiple sources. The player with the most points wins.

## 2. Components
- **General**: Game board, 25 area tiles, 5 large location tiles, campaign deck (30 cards), 30 machine tokens, 48 slot module tokens, 8 minor artifact tiles, 1 end game tile, 39 citizen cards, 28 energy markers, 28 crate tokens, 2 action cubes
- **Player**: 4 player boards, 6 tribe boards, 10 artifact cards, 4 player aid cards, 4 switch tokens, 12 machine track markers, 80 progress markers, 16 resource markers

1. Place game board in center. Shuffle 5 starting area tiles and place face-up on marked spaces. Shuffle remaining 25 area tiles and place face-down elsewhere.
2. Shuffle 5 large location tiles and place one on each corner space (random side up). Return unused tile to box.
3. Shuffle citizen cards into a deck. Reveal 5 face-up next to it (display).
4. Sort machine tokens by color; place in piles and reveal 3 of each color.
5. Shuffle slot modules; place in pile and reveal 5.
6. Shuffle crates; place face-down stack near board.
7. Place energy markers in supply. Place action cubes nearby.
8. Stack minor artifacts with end game tile on top.
9. Place major artifacts face-up on crater spaces; use only those marked for player count.

**Player Setup**:
- Each player takes: player board, random tribe board (sun side up), 3 machine track markers (grey, green, yellow), 1 energy, 1 switch token (slid up), 6 starting citizen cards (same letter), 1 random artifact card (secret), 1 player aid card.
- Shuffle starting cards; place 3 face-down (resting area), 3 face-up (active area).
- Choose player color: take 5 small buildings, 3 large buildings, 7 population figures (place one on each icon), 2 pawns (one on 0 of point track, one on first space of hibernation track).
- Place 20 progress markers: one on each reward space of machine tracks, one on each space at bottom of tribe board.
- Place 4 resource markers on bottom space of each resource track.
- **Starting Resources**: P1: 1 crystal; P2: 1 crystal + 1 gear; P3: 1 crystal + 1 gear + 1 book; P4: 1 of each.
- **Solo**: Start with 1 crystal. Place 1 action cube on first space of progress track. Return other cube.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
1. Starting player takes first turn.
2. On your turn, perform up to 2 actions (same or different) OR hibernate.
3. Actions available: Play a card, Use switch token, Explore, Populate, Build.
4. Free actions (any time, any number): Trade crystals, Use unlocked machines, Open crates.
5. Players take turns clockwise until a player takes the last major artifact and the end game tile.
6. All other players take one final turn.
7. End game scoring begins.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Resources**: Gear, Book, Food, Crystal. Advance markers when gaining; move down when spending. Crystals can convert to any basic resource. If gain resource at top of track, excess is lost.
- **Points**: Blue points scored during game (advance point marker; gain rewards at bonus spaces). Purple points scored only at end game (no bonus rewards).
- **Range**: For Explore, Build, Populate. Initially from chasm; after first placement, from nearest own piece. Pay 1 food per space between origin and destination (not counting either). Cannot pass through unexplored tiles.
- **Progress Track**: Place progress marker when activating tribe ability or unlocking machine reward. Gain immediate rewards (energy, artifact, etc.) when covering bonus spaces. Score points from lowest visible space at game end.
- **Card Play**: Play card from active area to vacant card slot. Gain top effect in top slot, bottom effect in bottom slot. Fifth slot unlocked via Populate technology. Cards with slot symbols allow stacking.
- **Slot Modules**: Gain when playing certain cards. Place on module spaces. Gain effect if played card color matches module. Activate immediately if placed on activation symbol.
- **Machine Tracks**: Advance markers via Build rewards. Unlock rewards at certain thresholds. Some require 2 different markers. Unlock machines, artifacts, or bonuses. End game card bonus grants 2 points per card of color (excluding starting cards).

## 6. Scoring & End Game
**Trigger**: When last major artifact is taken, that player also takes end game tile. All other players take one last turn. Afterward, score purple points.

**Scoring**:
- Lowest visible points on progress track
- Points on unlocked technologies on tribe board
- Points from each large location where you have a population figure
- If end game card bonus unlocked: 2 points per card of shown color (excluding starting cards)
- 4 points for end game tile
- 2 points per minor artifact (artifacts collected after end game triggered)
- 1 point per 5 remaining resources (rounded down)
- Points from artifact card and major artifacts: Score all three categories on artifact card once. For each major artifact collected, score the category matching the artifact's color one additional time.

**Winning**:
- Most points wins.
- Tiebreaker 1: Most remaining unscored resources.
- Tiebreaker 2: Most total spaces advanced on three machine tracks combined.
- If still tied: Share victory.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hibernating**: Return energy to storage, move resting cards to active (face-up), move slotted cards to resting (face-down), slide switch token up, advance hibernation marker and gain reward. Can spend energy on machines before hibernating.
- **Minor Artifacts**: Unlimited supply. Used when artifact would be gained after game end triggered. Worth 2 points each.
- **End Game Card Bonus**: Only counts recruited cards (not starting cards) of the shown color.
- **Tiebreakers**: Resources > Machine track progress > Shared victory.
- **Solo Game End**: Ends when action cube passes top of progress track. Score compared to victory table (Survivor at 50+, up to Utopia at 180+).
