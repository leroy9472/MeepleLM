## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The goal is to gain the most Victory Points (VP) through strategic control of tiles, resource management, and use of special powers. Players manipulate tribes of meeples across the mystical city-state of Naqala, claiming territory, building structures, and acquiring powerful Djinns. Victory is determined by scoring points from coins, controlled tiles, structures, meeples, Djinns, and card sets.

2. Components  
- Game board formed by 30–42 tiles (depending on expansion), including Oasis, Village, Market, Sacred Place, Workshop, Chasm, Great Lake, and Fabulous City tiles  
- 90 meeples in 5 colors: Yellow (Viziers), White (Elders), Green (Merchants), Blue (Builders), Red (Assassins), and Purple (Artisans, in expansion)  
- 48+ resource cards (merchandise), including Fakir/Slave cards  
- Djinn cards with unique powers  
- 8–11 camels per player (color-coded), 1 tent per player (Artisans expansion)  
- Turn order and bid order tracks  
- Gold coins (50 per player: 9×5, 5×1)  
- Item markers (Artisans expansion): Precious (VP) and Magic (one-time effects)  
- "Whims of the Sultan" cards (Sultan expansion)  
- Mountain pieces (Artisans/Sultan expansions)  
- Optional: Round counter (Council of Naqala)

3. Setup  
- Form board: 5×6 grid (base), 6×6 or 6×7 (with expansions). Orient all tiles the same way.  
- Place impassable tiles: Chasm and Great Lake cannot hold meeples or movement.  
- Place mountain pieces on Workshop tiles; mountains block movement but not Red/Blue powers.  
- Place 3 random meeples on each tile (except Chasm and Great Lake).  
- Shuffle resource deck; lay out 9 face-up in a row.  
- Shuffle Djinn deck; reveal 3 face-up.  
- Place "Whims of the Sultan" cards on Fabulous City tiles if using expansion.  
- Each player takes:  
  - 8 camels (11 for 2 players), 1 tent (Artisans), 1 turn marker, 50 coins  
- Randomly place turn markers on bid order track (1–4, or 1–5 with 5 players).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round:  
1. Bid for turn order (simultaneous placement, pay coins)  
2. Players take full turns in turn order  
3. Clean-up: refill resource row to 9, Djinn row to 3, "Whims" to empty Fabulous Cities  
4. Repeat until end game triggered  
5. Final scoring  

5. Core Mechanics  

**Bid for Turn Order**  
- In bid track order, players place their turn marker on an open bid space (0–4 or 0–5)  
- Pay coins immediately; 0 bid pushes others down (max 3 on 0)  
- Turn order is determined by bid placement (lowest number goes first)  

**Player Turn**  
1. **Move Turn Marker**: Place on next open bid space  
2. **Move Meeples**:  
   - Pick up all meeples from a tile with ≥1 meeple  
   - Move orthogonally (no diagonal, no immediate backtracking)  
   - Drop 1 meeple per tile moved through  
   - Final meeple must land on a tile with at least one meeple of the same color  
3. **Check for Control**:  
   - Remove last dropped meeple and all matching color meeples from that tile  
   - If tile is now empty, claim it with a camel or tent  
4. **Tribe Actions**:  
   - **Yellow (Viziers)**: Keep; score 1 VP each + 10 VP per player with fewer at game end  
   - **White (Elders)**: Keep; worth 2 VP each, can be spent to activate Djinns  
   - **Green (Merchants)**: Return to bag; take that many resource cards from front of row  
   - **Blue (Builders)**: Return to bag; earn coins = (number of Builders + Fakirs discarded) × (number of blue-valued tiles adjacent + final tile)  
   - **Red (Assassins)**: Return to bag; "kill" 1 meeple up to (number of Assassins + Fakirs discarded) tiles away (orthogonal); or kill 1 Yellow/White meeple from opponent. If killing empties a tile, claim it.  
   - **Purple (Artisans)**: Keep; draw equal number of item markers, keep 1 (face-down), discard rest. Score 2 VP each, or 3 VP if you have the most.  
5. **Tile Actions** (on final tile):  
   - **Oasis**: Place 1 Palm Tree (mandatory)  
   - **Village**: Place 1 Palace (mandatory)  
   - **Small Market**: Pay 3 coins to take 1 of first 3 resource cards  
   - **Large Market**: Pay 6 coins to take 2 of first 6 resource cards  
   - **Specialized Market**: Pay 4 coins to take 1 of any visible cards  
   - **Sacred Place**: Pay 2 Elders or 1 Elder + 1 Fakir to take 1 face-up Djinn  
   - **Workshop**: Pay 1 Artisan or 2 Fakirs to take top item marker  
   - **Fabulous City**: Take face-up "Whim of the Sultan" card if present  
6. **Merchandise Sale (Optional)**:  
   - Sell sets of different resource cards (excluding Fakirs)  
   - Earn coins: 1/3/7/13/21/30/40/50/60 for 1–9 different cards  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after current round when:  
- A player places their last camel or tent  
- No legal moves remain (no tile with meeples allows valid move)  
- (Council of Naqala) After 10 rounds  

**Final Scoring**:  
- Coins: 1 VP each  
- Yellow Viziers: 1 VP each + 10 VP per player with fewer  
- White Elders: 2 VP each (4 VP with Shamhat)  
- Purple Artisans: 2 VP each (3 VP if most)  
- Djinns: VP value on card  
- Controlled tiles: VP value on tile  
- Palm Trees: 3 VP each (6 VP if adjacent to Great Lake; 5 VP with Haurvatat)  
- Palaces: 5 VP each (10 VP if adjacent to Great Lake)  
- Tents: Tile VP + 1 VP per adjacent red-valued tile (including self)  
- Fabulous Cities: 5/20/45/80/125 VP for controlling 1–5  
- Merchandise sets: 1/3/7/13/21/30/40/50/60 VP for 1–9 different cards  
- Items: Precious Items worth listed VP; Magic Items not scored  
- Djinns with end-game effects (e.g., Jafar, Shamhat, Ptah, Wilwit, etc.) apply  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Ties**: No official tiebreaker  
- **Legal Moves**: If a move exists, player must take it; others may point it out  
- **Movement Loops**: Allowed; can revisit tiles if not backtracking immediately  
- **Final Tile Color Match**: Can use meeples just dropped to satisfy color requirement  
- **Djinn Use**: Can be used anytime on your turn; once per turn unless specified  
- **Item Use**: Magic items used once per turn, then discarded  
- **Mountain Movement**: Only Flying Carpet ignores mountains, and only for last meeple drop  
- **End Game Trigger**: Game continues until all players have taken equal turns in the final round  
- **Camel Limit**: Cannot claim tile without camel/tent; must have one available  
- **Resource Cards**: Hidden information  
- **Fakirs/Slaves**: Interchangeable; used to boost actions or pay costs
