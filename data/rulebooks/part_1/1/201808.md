## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are rival thieves attempting to infiltrate Dragon Keep, steal valuable Artifacts, and escape alive. The dragon Nicki guards her hoard fiercely—noise (Clank!) and stolen treasures increase her rage. The ultimate goal is to become the Greatest Thief in the Realm by escaping with an Artifact and the most Victory Points (VP).  

**Primary Objectives:**  
- Steal at least **one Artifact**—failure to do so results in automatic loss.  
- Accumulate the highest VP total from Artifacts, Gold, acquired tokens, and deck cards.  
- Survive above the Grass Line (depths boundary) or escape the dungeon to score points.  

**Winning Conditions:**  
- Players knocked out **below the Grass Line** score 0.  
- Players knocked out **above the Grass Line** score their collected loot (if they have an Artifact).  
- Escaping players receive a **20 VP Mastery Token**.  
- Game ends immediately when the **Countdown Track reaches the Skull** or all players have exited/knocked out.  
- Ties broken by highest-value Artifact; further ties unresolved.
