## The Crew: Planet Nine & Deep Sea — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Crew is a cooperative, mission-based trick-taking game set in two sci-fi themes: *Planet Nine* (space exploration) and *Deep Sea* (underwater expedition). Players take on roles as crew members working together to complete a series of increasingly complex missions. The objective in each mission is for specific players to win specific tricks under strict communication constraints. Success requires strategic planning, non-verbal cues, and perfect coordination.

### 2. Components  
- **40 Large Cards**:  
  - 36 Color cards (four suits/colors, values 1–9)  
  - 4 Special cards: Rockets (Planet Nine) or Submarines (Deep Sea) – function as trumps  
- **96 Small Task Cards**: Each with a mission objective and difficulty value (scales by player count)  
- **Tokens and Accessories**:  
  - Communication tokens:  
    - *Planet Nine*: 1 Communication token and 1 Captain token per player  
    - *Deep Sea*: 1 Sonar token (green/red) and 1 Captain token per player  
  - Distress Signal token (buoy-shaped, two-sided)  
  - Reminder cards (gray, one per player)  
- **Mission Logbook / Mission Sheets**: Contains sequential missions with unique rules and setup instructions  
- **AI Characters**:  
  - *Planet Nine*: Jarvis (AI for 2-player mode)  
  - *Deep Sea*: Tonoja (AI for 2-player mode)

### 3. Setup  
1. **Choose Mission**: Refer to the Mission Logbook or Mission Sheet for rules, difficulty, and special conditions.  
2. **Deal Large Cards**:  
   - 3 players: One player receives 14 cards, others 13 (extra card not played)  
   - 4 players: Each receives 10 cards  
   - 5 players: Each receives 8 cards  
3. **Assign Captain**:  
   - *Planet Nine*: Player holding Rocket 4  
   - *Deep Sea*: Player holding Submarine 4  
   - Captain receives Captain token  
4. **Distribute Tokens**: Each player gets one communication token (Communication/Sonar) and a Reminder card  
5. **Prepare Task Cards**:  
   - Shuffle the 96 small Task cards  
   - Draw Task cards until the total difficulty value matches the mission requirement (as shown in life preserver symbol or mission text)  
   - Skip any card that would exceed the required total  
6. **Assign Tasks**:  
   - Starting with Captain, players take turns selecting one Task card clockwise until all are assigned  
   - If fewer Tasks than players, some players may receive no Tasks  
   - **Free Task Selection (purple octopus symbol)**: Players may discuss task distribution (but not hand contents)  
7. **Check for Impossibility**:  
   - Discard and replace any Task that creates an impossible condition (e.g., conflicting first-trick Tasks)  
   - If a player holds all required cards (e.g., all Submarines and needed Color card), reshuffle and redealt  
8. **Optional Distress Signal**:  
   - Players may activate the Distress Signal before play begins  
   - All pass one non-trump card (non-Rocket/non-Submarine) to adjacent player (direction chosen collectively)  
   - Signal remains active for the entire mission  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **First Trick**: Captain leads the first card  
2. **Trick Play Order**:  
   - Clockwise play  
   - Must follow suit (color or trump) if possible  
   - If cannot follow suit, may play any card  
   - **Trump Rule**: If a Rocket/Submarine is played, highest Rocket/Submarine wins  
   - **Lead Trump Rule**: If a Rocket/Submarine is led, players must follow with that suit if able  
3. **Winning a Trick**:  
   - Highest card of the led suit wins, unless trump played  
   - Winner places trick face up in front of them (only previous trick remains visible)  
   - Winner leads the next trick  
4. **Communication Phase (once per round)**:  
   - **Before any trick**, a player may place one Color card face up and use their communication token:  
     - Top = highest in that color  
     - Middle = only card in that color  
     - Bottom = lowest in that color  
   - Reminder card is placed into hand to indicate the public card is still part of it  
   - Once the card is played, discard Reminder and flip token to red side  
   - **Restrictions apply in some missions** (see Core Mechanics)  
5. **Distress Mechanic (once per round)**:  
   - Available only at the start of the mission (before first trick)  
   - All players pass one non-trump card to left or right (group decision)  
   - Can be triggered via Distress Signal or mission rule  
6. **AI Rules (2-player mode)**:  
   - Remove Rocket 4 / Submarine 4 from deck  
   - Deal 7 cards face down and 7 face up to AI (Jarvis/Tonoja)  
   - Reinsert Rocket 4 / Submarine 4 and deal remaining cards  
   - Captain plays for AI, using only face-up cards  
   - When a face-down card is uncovered, flip it after the trick  
   - AI may be assigned Tasks  
   - For Deep Sea, use 3-player task difficulty values  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Trump System**:  
  - Rockets (Planet Nine) and Submarines (Deep Sea) are trumps  
  - If any trump is played, highest trump wins  
  - If trump is led, must follow with trump if possible  
- **Communication Rules**:  
  - No verbal or physical hints about hand contents  
  - One communication action per player per mission (in most missions)  
  - Communication only allowed between tricks, not during  
  - Reminder card must be held until public card is played  
- **Special Communication Modes**:  
  - **Currents (red ? symbol)**: May place a Color card face up, but **no token placement** (token placed red side up beside it)  
  - **Rapture of the Deep (red –2 symbol)**: Place (number of players – 2) Sonar tokens in center. Any player may use one token for a communication (no discussion)  
  - **Unfamiliar Terrain (numbered Sonar symbols 1–9)**: Draw a random Color card (reroll if Submarine); result determines communication rule:  
    - 1–3: Normal  
    - 4–6: Currents  
    - 7–9: Rapture of the Deep  
- **Task-Specific Rules**:  
  - “Win exactly/at least X tricks”: evaluated at end of mission  
  - “Trick total < X” or “all values > X”: **Submarines/Rockets not counted**  
  - “More of color A than B”: zero allowed for B  
  - “As many of A as B”: must win at least one of each  
  - “Only odd/even cards”: **no Submarines/Rockets allowed**  
  - “No trick may be opened with pink card or Submarine/Rocket”: strict lead restriction  
- **Real-Time Missions (clock symbol)**:  
  - Players may choose to play under time limit (e.g., 3:30)  
  - If time runs out, mission fails  
  - If played untimed, “Currents” rule applies  
- **Task Allocation Variants**:  
  - Missions 14–16 (Deep Sea): One player takes all Tasks – Captain asks clockwise for volunteers; Captain must volunteer if others pass  
  - Mission 26 (Deep Sea): Two players take all Tasks – Captain asks for volunteers; Captain must volunteer if only one other does  
- **Player Count Variants**:  
  - **3 Players**: Remove all green cards and Rocket 1 (Planet Nine only)  
  - **5 Players**: After Mission 25, one player may transfer their Task to another player during each mission  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Mission Success**:  
  - All Tasks are completed by correct players  
  - Immediately advance to next mission in Logbook  
- **Mission Failure**:  
  - Wrong player completes a Task  
  - All cards played and Tasks not completed  
  - Time limit expired (real-time missions)  
  - Players may retry with **same Tasks** or draw **new Tasks**  
- **Epilogue Mode (Deep Sea)**:  
  - After completing main missions, continue playing starting at difficulty 18  
  - Increase difficulty by 1 after each success  
  - Track Distress Signal uses  
  - Free Task Selection applies  
  - Goal: See how high a difficulty you can reach  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I communicate after playing my public card?**  
  No. Each player may only perform one communication action per mission (unless Rapture of the Deep allows multiple shared tokens).  
- **What happens if I misrepresent my hand with a communication token?**  
  You are not required to correct it. The token cannot be repositioned once placed.  
- **Can I play my public card at any time?**  
  Yes, as long as you follow suit. Once played, discard Reminder card and flip token to red.  
- **Can the AI win a Task?**  
  Yes. If the AI (Jarvis/Tonoja) wins a trick that fulfills a Task assigned to it, the Task is completed.  
- **Do I have to complete Tasks in order?**  
  No. Tasks are completed as conditions are met. Multiple Tasks can be completed in one trick.  
- **Can I pass a trump card during Distress?**  
  No. Only non-trump cards (non-Rocket, non-Submarine) may be passed.  
- **What if I have no cards of a suit when it’s led?**  
  Play any card. You are not required to play a trump unless you cannot follow suit.
