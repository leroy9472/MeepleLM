# BRASS: BIRMINGHAM — COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE MANUAL

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Brass: Birmingham*, players assume the roles of industrial entrepreneurs in the West Midlands during England’s Industrial Revolution (1770–1870). The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VPs) by building industries, expanding networks, and selling goods across two eras: the Canal Era and the Rail Era. VPs are scored at the end of each era. The player with the highest total at the end of the Rail Era wins. Tiebreakers: highest income (marker position), then most money.

### 2. Components
- Game board (Day/Night side)
- Player mats (two-sided)
- Industry tiles (Cotton Mills, Coal Mines, Iron Works, Manufacturers, Potteries, Breweries)
- Link tiles (Canal and Rail)
- Resource cubes (Coal, Iron), Beer barrels
- Wild Location and Wild Industry cards
- Location and Industry cards
- Merchant tiles
- Player markers: Income, VP
- Character tiles (for turn order)
- Money (in various denominations)
- Progress Track (on board)

### 3. Setup
1. Choose board side (Day or Night).  
2. For player count < 4: remove excess Location cards, Industry cards, and Merchant tiles marked for higher player counts.  
3. Place 4 Wild Location and 4 Wild Industry cards face-up beside Shrewsbury.  
4. Shuffle remaining cards into a draw deck; place face-down on board.  
5. Shuffle Merchant tiles; place one face-up on each marked space (e.g., no Warrington in 2p, no Nottingham in 2p/3p).  
6. Place 1 Beer barrel next to each non-blank Merchant tile.  
7. Fill Coal Market (1 cube per space, leave one £1 space free) and Iron Market (1 cube per space, leave both £1 spaces free).  
8. Place remaining resources and money in General Supply.  
9. Each player:  
   - Takes matching player mat, Industry tiles, Link tiles, VP and Income markers.  
   - Places Industry tiles (black top half down) on mat, stacked by level and industry.  
   - Receives £17.  
   - Places VP marker on 0, Income marker on highest space of Income Level 10.  
   - Draws 8 cards for hand.  
   - Draws 1 card face-down for discard pile.  
10. Shuffle Character tiles; place randomly on Turn Order Track.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- The game spans two eras: Canal Era, then Rail Era.  
- Each era consists of 8 (4p), 9 (3p), or 10 (2p) rounds.  
- On a player’s turn:  
  1. Perform two actions (one card discarded per action).  
  2. Spend money (placed on Character tile).  
  3. Refill hand to 8 cards (if possible).  
- After all players complete their turns:  
  1. **End of Round**:  
     - Reorder Turn Order Track: least spender first, most last; ties retain relative order.  
     - Return spent money to bank.  
     - Each player gains income equal to their Income Level (negative = pay bank).  
     - If unable to pay negative income, sell Industry tiles (½ cost, rounded down) or lose 1 VP per £1 shortfall.  
- **End of Era**:  
  - Triggered when draw deck and all hands are empty.  
  - Score Link and flipped Industry tiles.  
  - Canal Era only: remove Level 1 Industry tiles from board, reset Merchant Beer, shuffle discards into new deck, deal 8 cards.  
  - Rail Era: game ends after scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Actions (Choose any two per turn)
- **Build**:  
  - Discard a Location card to build any Industry tile at named location (even if not in network).  
  - Discard an Industry card to build matching Industry in a location in your network (or any if you have no tiles).  
  - Discard Wild Location: build any Industry at any named location (excludes Farm Breweries).  
  - Discard Wild Industry: build matching Industry in any network location.  
  - Place lowest-level tile of chosen Industry on matching undeveloped space (prefer single-icon spaces).  
  - Pay cost (money, coal, iron) shown on player mat.  
  - Place resources:  
    - Coal Mine: place coal cubes (as shown).  
    - Iron Works: place iron cubes (as shown).  
    - Brewery: 1 beer (Canal Era), 2 beer (Rail Era).  
  - **Sell to Market**:  
    - Iron Works: immediately sell iron to market (fill highest-price spaces first).  
    - Coal Mine: if connected to Merchant (via link), sell coal to market (same as above).  
  - **Overbuilding**:  
    - Replace own tile: any Industry; return resources to supply.  
    - Replace opponent’s tile: only Coal Mine or Iron Works; only if no cubes of that resource exist on board or market.  
  - **Farm Breweries** (unnamed spaces): build only with Brewery Industry or Wild Industry card; must be in network (or no tiles). Link between Kidderminster-Worcester connects both to adjacent Farm Brewery.

- **Network**:  
  - Discard any card.  
  - Place Link tile adjacent to a location in your network (or any line if you have no tiles).  
  - **Canal Era**: £3 per canal tile (1 per action).  
  - **Rail Era**:  
    - 1 rail: £5 + 1 coal (must be connected after placement).  
    - 2 rails: £15 + 2 coal + 1 beer (beer from brewery only; if from opponent, must be connected to second rail after placement).

- **Sell**:  
  - Discard any card.  
  - Choose unflipped Cotton Mill, Manufacturer, or Pottery tile connected to matching Merchant.  
  - Consume required beer (shown top-right). Sources:  
    - Your Breweries (anywhere, no connection).  
    - Opponent’s Brewery (must be connected).  
    - Merchant beer slot (only when selling to that Merchant).  
  - Flip tile; advance Income marker by arrow value (bottom-right).  
  - Repeat for other eligible tiles.  
  - **Merchant Beer Bonus** (if using Merchant beer):  
    - Gloucester (Develop): remove lowest-level tile of any industry (no iron cost; not lightbulb Pottery).  
    - Oxford (Income): +2 Income spaces.  
    - Nottingham/Shrewsbury (VP): gain 3 or 4 VP.  
    - Warrington (Money): gain £5.

- **Develop**:  
  - Discard any card.  
  - Remove 1 or 2 lowest-level Industry tiles from mat (any industry, one at a time).  
  - Consume 1 iron per tile removed.

- **Loan**:  
  - Discard any card.  
  - Take £30 from bank.  
  - Move Income marker back 3 Income Levels (not spaces); place on highest space of new level.  
  - Cannot go below Income Level -10.

- **Scout**:  
  - Discard any 3 cards.  
  - Take 1 Wild Location and 1 Wild Industry card.  
  - Cannot perform if you have any Wild card in hand.

- **Pass**:

#### Network & Connections
- **Your Network**: A location is in your network if:  
  - It contains one of your Industry tiles, or  
  - It is adjacent to one of your Link tiles.  
- **Connected**: Two locations are connected if a path of Link tiles (any player) exists between them.

#### Resource Consumption
- **Coal**:  
  - Required for Rail links and some builds.  
  - Must be connected after placement.  
  - Source: closest connected unflipped Coal Mine (free; choose if tied).

- **Iron**:  
  - Required for Develop and some builds.  
  - No connection needed.  
  - Source: any unflipped Iron Works (free; can use multiple).  
  - If none: purchase from Market (£1–£6).  
- **Beer**:  
  - Required for Sell and double Rail build.  
  - Source:  
    - Your Breweries (no connection).  
    - Opponent’s Brewery (must be connected).  
    - Merchant beer slot (only during Sell to that Merchant).  
  - Cannot be purchased; if none available, action cannot be performed.

#### Flipping Tiles
- **Coal Mine, Iron Works, Brewery**: Flip when last resource is removed (by anyone). Owner gains Income (arrow value).  
- **Cotton Mill, Manufacturer, Pottery**: Flip via Sell action. Owner gains Income (arrow value).

### 6. Scoring & End Game

  2. **Score Flipped Industry Tiles**:  
     - Score VP shown in bottom-left hexagon of each flipped Industry tile.  
     - Unflipped tiles score nothing.
