3. **Die Tiles**:
   - Randomly place one die tile of each color on the three green ♦ spaces on 1st floor.
   - Fill remaining rooms in numerical order with random die tiles.

     - Gain Resource(s) from Resource card → place card in Lantern Area.
     - If Resource card grants Decree card, take it and place in Lantern Area.

4. **Lantern Reward**: If die taken from left end of bridge, gain all visible Lantern Rewards from your Domain Board.
5. **Perform Actions**: Based on where die was placed.
