### 1. Lore & Objective
Paladins of the West Kingdom is set in 900 AD West Francia, where players take on the role of nobles defending against outsiders like Saracens and Vikings. In solo play, the human player competes against an AI opponent to earn the most Victory Points (VP) over 7 rounds by building fortifications, spreading faith, and confronting enemies.

### 2. Components
- AI Player Board (reverse side of standard player board)
- 7 Monks, 7 Outposts, 7 Jars
- AI Attribute Markers (Blue/Influence, Black/Faith, Red/Strength)
- Resource Marker
- Scheme Cards (17 total, including 5 "King's Favour" cards)
- King’s Order Cards (6 total)
- King’s Favour Cards (10 total)
- AI Workshops
- Main game components: Townsfolk, Outsider, Wall, Suspicion, Debt, Tavern, and Paladin cards; Silver, Provisions, Workers

### 3. Setup
1. Assemble main board and set up central areas:
   - Place 5 face-up Townsfolk cards; 6 face-up Outsider cards
   - Place Wall deck; set Tax supply (5 Silver for 1 player)
   - Place Debt (unpaid side up) and Suspicion decks
   - Shuffle and place 3 King’s Order and 5 King’s Favour cards face down
   - Place Tavern deck
2. Set up AI:
   - Flip a player board to AI side
   - Place 7 Monks, 7 Outposts, 7 Jars on respective rows
   - Stack AI Attribute Markers at 0: Influence (bottom), Faith (middle), Strength (top)
   - Place Resource Marker on leftmost space of Resource Track
   - Set aside 5 "King’s Favour" Scheme Cards
   - Shuffle remaining Scheme Cards and place face down on AI board
3. Choose difficulty:
   - Easy: Reveal 1 King’s Order → place 1 AI Workshop on matching action
   - Standard: Reveal 3 → place 3 AI Workshops
   - Hard: Reveal 5 → place 5 AI Workshops
   - Reshuffle King’s Order deck and place 3 face down on main board
4. Place 1 AI Workshop on each face-down King’s Order card
5. Place 1 "King’s Favour" Scheme Card face up on each King’s Favour card

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- **Player starts each round**
- Players alternate turns until both pass
- On AI turn:
  1. Reveal top Scheme Card
  2. Attempt to perform action if possible (workers, requirements, availability)
  3. If not possible, perform leftmost available action on top row (Recruit → Pray → Trade → Conspire → Rest)
  4. Resolve action effects
  5. AI continues until out of workers or takes Rest action
- End of round: refresh cards, clear workers, prepare for next round

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Resource Track**: Instead of gaining resources, AI moves Resource Marker right 1 space per resource. When looping, increase lowest Attribute by 1 (top marker if tied).
- **Targeting via Resource Marker**: AI uses marker position to determine target for Townsfolk, Outsider, and King’s Favour cards. If unavailable, moves right (wraps to left).
- **Workers**: AI starts each round with (Round Number + 3) workers. All worker colors are interchangeable. Gains Suspicion when gaining Criminals.
- **Action Resolution**:
  - **Absolve**: If Influence ≥ leftmost Jar value, flip Jar, +1 Faith, remove 1 Suspicion, then either flip unpaid Debt or remove another Suspicion.
  - **Attack**: Target Outsider at Resource Marker position (within Strength limit). Gain rewards, keep card facedown.
  - **Commission**: Place leftmost Monk on main board. Prioritize: Free Recruit > Pay Debt (if any) > Pray > Gain 2 Workers > Gain 1 Worker > Gain 2 Silver > Remove 1 Suspicion. Leftmost space if tied. Gain +1 Influence.
  - **Conspire**: Gain 1 Suspicion card and 2 Workers. For each Tax icon on card, return that much Silver from Tax to supply and advance Resource Marker 1 space.
  - **Convert**: Target Outsider at Resource Marker position (within Faith limit). Gain Strength bonus, place card faceup below player board.
  - **Fortify**: If Influence ≥ requirement, place Wall card in leftmost slot, gain all rewards (choose left option if choice).
  - **Garrison**: Place leftmost Outpost. Same priority and rules as Commission. Gain +1 Faith.
  - **King’s Order**: Attempt rightmost revealed King’s Order not yet completed. If all completed, attempt rightmost one.
  - **King’s Favour**: Target King’s Favour card at Resource Marker position. If blocked, move right.
  - **Pray**: Remove all workers from right side of AI board. If none, gain 1 Worker. Shuffle all Scheme Cards.
  - **Recruit**: Discard Townsfolk at Resource Marker position, gain top-right rewards.
  - **Rest**: Advance Resource Marker 1 space + 1 per remaining worker. AI passes remainder of round.
  - **Trade**: Advance Resource Marker 1 space.
- **AI Restrictions**: Ignores all Silver and Provision costs. Does not carry workers between rounds.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
At end of Round 7, both players score:
- Completed King’s Orders
- Attribute Tracks (Faith, Strength, Influence)
- Commissions (5+ = bonus)
- Fortifies (5+ = bonus + VP from Wall cards)
- Garrisons (5+ = bonus)
- Absolves (5+ = bonus)
- Converts (AI scores minimum 1 VP per Converted Outsider)
- Debts (Paid = +1 VP, Unpaid = -3 VP)
- Silver/Provisions (1 VP per set of 3)
- Develops (6+ = bonus, player only)

**Win Condition**: Player wins if their total VP > AI’s VP.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **No valid target for action**: AI moves to next card to the right (wraps if needed). If no valid target, takes leftmost top-row action.
- **No Suspicion/Debt to remove**: Return 1 Silver from Tax to main supply (no Resource Marker movement).
- **Resource Marker loop**: Move marker back to start and increase lowest Attribute by 1 (top of stack if tied).
- **King’s Favour unavailable**: AI moves right along track. If all blocked, takes fallback action.
- **Ties in attribute values**: Topmost marker breaks tie.
- **Pray with no workers**: AI gains 1 Worker and reshuffles Scheme deck.
- **Multiple Scheme Cards**: Only reshuffled when Pray is taken, not between rounds.
