## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players take control of the Galactic Empire or Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. The Empire seeks to crush the Rebellion by discovering and destroying the hidden Rebel Base. The Rebels must grow their support across the galaxy and survive long enough for the Imperial regime to collapse under its own weight.  

Victory Conditions:  
- Empire wins immediately if:  
  - The Rebel Base system (revealed or hidden) is destroyed by the Death Star.  
  - Imperial units occupy the revealed Rebel Base system and no Rebel units remain in that system.  
- Rebel wins immediately if the Rebel Reputation marker and the Time marker occupy the same space on the Time Track.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:  
1. Assignment Phase  
2. Command Phase  
3. Refresh Phase  

Rebel player always goes first in each phase unless otherwise specified.

5. Core Mechanics  
Assignment Phase:  
- Rebel player assigns 1–2 leaders to mission cards (face down).  
- Imperial player does the same.  
- Leaders assigned must meet the mission’s skill requirement.  
- "Resolve" missions cannot be opposed. "Attempt" missions can be opposed.  

Command Phase:  
Players alternate taking actions until both pass. Actions:  
- Activate a System:  
  - Place a leader with tactic values into a system.  
  - Move ships from adjacent systems into the activated system (follow transport limits).  
  - Rebel units may move between Rebel Base space and adjacent systems (if base is hidden).  
  - If Imperial ground units enter the Rebel Base system, reveal it: move all units from Rebel Base space to the system.  
- Reveal and Attempt a Mission:  
  - Turn face-up a mission card.  
  - Opponent may send 1 leader from pool to oppose.  
  - Each player rolls dice equal to the number of matching skill icons on leaders in the system.  
  - Attacker needs more successes than defender to succeed.  
  - Each ⚀ is 1 success; ⚁ is 2 successes.  
  - If leader on the mission card attempts it, add 2 extra successes.  
  - Unopposed missions succeed automatically unless defender assigns a leader with 0 skill (forces roll).  
- Pass: Once passed, player can still oppose missions or add leaders to combat.

Combat:  
Triggered when opposing units occupy the same system.  
- Add Leader (optional): Defender may add 1 leader from pool.  
- Action Cards: Each player may play "Start of Combat" action cards if required leader is present.  
- Draw Tactic Cards: Each player draws number of tactic cards equal to highest tactic value of their leaders in the system (space or ground).  
- Combat Round:  
  - Space Battle (if both have space units):  
    - Attacker rolls dice based on space units (max 5 red, 5 black).  
    - Assign damage; defender blocks with tactic cards.  
    - Defender returns fire.  
  - Ground Battle (if both have ground units): same as space.  
  - Special Die (⚁): Can remove 1 damage from a matching-color unit.  
- Retreat:  
  - Attacker may retreat first, then defender (if they have a leader in system).  
  - Move ships and ground units to adjacent system (prioritize friendly units/loyalty).  
  - Cannot retreat to attacker’s origin.  
  - Death Star cannot retreat.  
- Repeat combat rounds until one side has no units.  

Refresh Phase:  
1. Play Objective Card (Rebel only): May play one completed objective card.  
2. Retrieve Leaders: Return all leaders to pools.  
3. Draw Missions: Each player draws 2 mission cards, discards down to 10.  
4. Probe Cards: Imperial draws 2 probe cards.  
5. Objective Card: Rebel draws 1 objective card.  
6. Advance Time Marker:  
   - If Recruit Icon: Each player draws 2 action cards, chooses 1 to keep, recruits leader shown, resolves "Immediate" effect. Other card goes to bottom of deck.  
   - If Build Icon: Each player places units on build queue from loyal/subjugated systems (not sabotaged or enemy-occupied). Subjugated systems use only leftmost resource icon.  
7. Deploy Units:  
   - Slide units down build queue.  
   - Units that fall off may be deployed (max 2 per system) to loyal/subjugated systems (not sabotaged or enemy-occupied).  
   - Rebels may also deploy to Rebel Base space.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Empire wins if:  
  - Rebel Base system is destroyed by Death Star.  
  - Imperial units occupy revealed Rebel Base system with no Rebel units present.  
- Rebel wins if:  
  - Rebel Reputation marker and Time marker are on the same space.  
Game ends immediately when either condition is met.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Captured Leaders:  
  - May be moved as Imperial ground units.  
  - Rescued if: no Imperial units in system, ability resolves, or rescue mission completed.  
  - Rescued leader returns to Rebel Base space.  
- Sabotage Markers:  
  - Prevent use of resource icons and deployment.  
  - Units may still be placed on build queue.  
- Subjugation:  
  - If no Imperial ground unit in subjugated system, remove marker; loyalty reverts to Rebel or neutral.  
- Rebel Base Relocation:  
  - If Empire discovers base and loses ground combat, Rebels may choose a new base from probe deck.  
  - If probe deck is empty, base stays until Empire wins combat or Rebels win.  
- Death Star:  
  - Can destroy planet after entering system.  
  - Max 3 planets destroyed per game.  
  - Must have space combat first if Rebels have space units.  
- Structures:  
  - Immobil, destroyed if alone and enemy has ground units (except Golan Arms Turret).  
- Unit Limits:  
  - Max 2 units deployed per system per Refresh Phase.  
  - Excess units return to build queue space 1.
