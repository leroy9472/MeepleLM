---

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Card Selection
- Each character selects 2 ability cards from their hand.
- One card is chosen as the **initiative card** (its initiative value determines turn order).
- Cards are placed face down, initiative card on bottom so it appears on top when revealed.

#### Ordering of Initiative
- Reveal all character and monster ability cards.
- Determine initiative order from lowest to highest.
- Monster sets act on the initiative value of their drawn ability card.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  - Character vs. monster: character goes first.
  - Two characters: compare second card’s initiative.

#### Character Turns
- On a character’s turn, they perform:
  - One **top action** from one card.
  - One **bottom action** from the other card.
- Actions may include:
  - **Move X**: Move up to X hexes. Costs 2 movement in difficult terrain (purple border).
  - **Attack X**: Deal base damage X. May have **Range Y** (ranged) or target adjacent (melee).
  - **Target X**: Hit up to X enemies.
  - **Area Effect**: Attack multiple hexes as shown in diagram.
  - **Push X / Pull X**: Force target to move X hexes away/toward.
  - **Heal X**: Restore X HP to self or ally.
  - **Loot X**: Collect money/treasure in current hex and Range X.
  - **Shield X**: Gain Shield X until end of round or scenario.
  - **Grant Action**: Allow another figure to perform one action.
  - **Destroy Obstacle**: Remove obstacle in range; place destruction tile.
  - **Suffer Damage**: Take unmodifiable damage.
  - **Conditions**: Apply effects like Stun, Immobilize, Poison, etc.

#### Initiative & Turn Order
- Characters and monster sets act in initiative order.
- Within a monster set: elites act first (by standee number), then normals.
- Each monster performs full turn before next acts.

#### Monster Turns
1. **Focus**:
   - Monster finds enemy it can reach with least movement.
   - Ignores line-of-sight.
   - Considers traps as obstacles.
   - If multiple valid targets, chooses one earlier in initiative order.
2. **Move**:
   - Moves toward focus using shortest path.
   - Avoids traps if possible.
   - For ranged attacks, moves away to avoid Disadvantage if possible.
3. **Attack**:
   - Performs attack as per ability card.
   - Uses monster attack modifier deck.
   - Applies conditions or bonuses from stat card (e.g., Muddle on all attacks).

#### Line-of-Sight
- Required for targeting.
- Draw line from any part of attacker’s hex to any part of target’s hex.
- Only walls block line-of-sight.

#### Damage & Killing
- Damage = Attack value + modifiers + attack modifier card.
- **Attack Bonuses**: +1 vs Poisoned target, Advantage/Disadvantage (draw 2 cards, best/worst).
- **Shield**: Reduces damage after modifiers.
- Monsters die when damage ≥ max HP. Remove standee, place money token.
- Characters die at 0 HP → **exhausted** (removed from map).

#### Conditions
- Last until end of target’s next full turn, unless otherwise noted.
- **Negative**:
  - **Immobilize**: Cannot Move.
  - **Stun**: Cannot perform any actions.
  - **Muddle**: All attacks gain Disadvantage.
  - **Disarm**: Cannot Attack.
  - **Poison**: All attacks vs. target gain +1 Attack. Prevents healing.
  - **Wound**: Suffer 1 damage at start of each turn. Removed by healing.
- **Positive**:
  - **Strengthen**: All attacks gain Advantage.
  - **Bless**: Shuffle Bless card (+2) into attack deck.
  - **Curse**: Shuffle Curse card (0) into target’s attack deck.

#### Elements
- **Infusion**: Performing an elemental action infuses that element (move token to "Strong").
- **Consumption**: Using an ability with ⊗ consumes the element (move to "Inert") for bonus.
- **Waning**: At end of round, all elements shift left (Strong → Waning → Inert).
- **Wild**: Players choose which element to infuse/consume.

#### Resting
- **Short Rest** (end of round):
  - Shuffle discard pile.
  - Move one random card to lost pile.
  - Return rest to hand.
  - May suffer 1 damage to keep desired card (once per rest).
- **Long Rest** (declare during card selection):
  - Turn occurs on initiative 99.
  - Choose one discard to lose.
  - Return rest to hand.
  - Heal 2, Self.
  - Refresh all spent items.

#### Negating Damage
- When taking damage, may instead:
  - Lose 1 card from hand, or
  - Lose 2 cards from discard pile.
- Prevents HP loss entirely.

#### Battle Goals
- Each player draws 2, keeps 1 secretly.
- If scenario succeeded and goal met, gain 1 check mark.
- Every 3 check marks = 1 perk.
