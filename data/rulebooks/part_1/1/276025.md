### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of player turns in clockwise order until a player reaches the final space. A turn has three phases:
- **Phase A: Sailing** – Move ship 1–7 spaces forward; cannot sail backward; must stop at hand symbol locations.
- **Phase B: Main Action** – Perform one main action based on location (city, village, quest, assistant, or homeward bound) and any free actions.
- **Phase C: Draw Cards** – Draw up to hand limit (4, upgradable to 6); may buy face-up display cards for £1 each.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **City Action**: Optional delivery of one good (discard matching card, place disc on market), then perform city-specific action.
- **Village Action**: Number of actions depends on movement points spent (1–3 = 1 action, 4–6 = 2, 7 = 3). Options include:
  - Discard all hand cards for £2.
  - Take £1.
  - Buy a card from hand or planning area.
  - Invest in a prestige building.
- **Quest Action**: Pay requirements (goods, swords, figures, etc.) to gain rewards and add tile to ship board. Score 3 VP for 4th quest, 2 VP for each additional.
- **Assistant Action**: Perform action from assistant card when ship is at same location. Can only use one per visit.
- **Combat**: Reveal combat token, choose nation to fight for, gain combat value. Spend combat value on actions:
  - Gain 1/2 influence for 2/5 combat points.
  - Annex/displace ownership marker at flag for 4/6 points.
- **Exploring**: Move explorer 1+ spaces on track, skip occupied spaces. Gain reward from final space. Cross barriers for influence or VP.
- **Free Actions**: Place card in planning area or complete career goal.
- **Ship Upgrades**: Remove both discs from an upgrade area to trigger:
  - Immediate bonuses (e.g., 3 VP, £5).
  - Ongoing effects (e.g., hand limit +2, free display cards).
  - Unlockable actions (e.g., new combat or village actions).
- **Legacy Tiles**: Alter rules (e.g., movement cost, new actions, restrictions) when placed.
