### 1. Lore & Objective
In 17th-century Central Europe, players take on the role of farming families striving to build successful farms after the Plague. The goal is to develop a balanced farm with fields, pastures, livestock, and a growing family while ensuring food sustainability. Victory is achieved through high scoring in various categories, with the highest total Victory Points (VP) determining the winner.

### 2. Components
- 3 game boards (main board, major improvements board, scoring overview)
- Farmyard boards (1 per player)
- Wooden components: family members (5 per player), stables (4 per player), fences (15 per player)
- Resource tokens: wood, clay, reed, stone
- Crop tokens: grain, vegetables
- Animal tokens: sheep, wild boar, cattle
- Food markers
- Cards: Action cards, Round cards, Occupation cards, Minor Improvement cards, Major Improvement cards, Begging cards, Summary cards
- House tiles: wood, clay, stone
- Starting Player marker

### 3. Setup
- Each player chooses a color and takes corresponding components.
- Place 2 wooden room tiles and 2 family members on the farmyard board.
- Assemble game boards and sort cards into decks.
- Sort Round cards by stage (Stage 6 at bottom), shuffle, and stack.
- For 3–5 players: place corresponding Action cards face-up on the main board.
- Deal 7 Occupation cards and 7 Minor Improvement cards to each player (remove unused cards based on player count).

- Place Begging cards face-up beside the play area.
- Each player takes a Summary card.
- Choose starting player: receives Starting Player marker and 2 Food; others receive 3 Food.
- Unlimited components: all except family members, stables, and fences are considered unlimited.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
**14 rounds divided into 6 stages. Each round has 4 phases:**
1. **Preparation Phase:** Draw a Round card and place it on the board. Replenish goods on accumulation spaces.
2. **Work Phase:** Starting with the starting player and proceeding clockwise, each player places one family member on an unoccupied action space and resolves its action. Repeat until all family members are placed.
3. **Returning Home Phase:** All family members return to the farmyard.
4. **Harvest Phase:** Occurs after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14:
   - **Field Phase:** Take 1 crop (grain or vegetable) from each sown field into supply.
   - **Feeding Phase:** Pay 2 Food per family member (1 for newborns). Use resources, improvements, or convert crops/animals to meet requirements. Take a Begging card for each missing Food.
   - **Breeding Phase:** For each animal type with 2+ adults, gain 1 baby if space is available.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Worker Placement:** Players place family members on action spaces; each space can be used only once per round.
- **Resource Acquisition:** Accumulation spaces provide increasing resources each round.
- **House Development:**
  - **Build Rooms:** Pay 5 of a building resource + 2 reed. Rooms must be orthogonally adjacent.
  - **Renovate:** Upgrade all rooms from wood → clay → stone. Requires 1 reed + 1 material per room.
- **Family Growth:** Requires room availability (except late-game action). Max 5 family members.
- **Cultivation:**
  - **Plow:** Place field tile adjacent to existing fields.
  - **Sow:** Use 1 grain/vegetable from supply + 2/1 from general supply to plant.
- **Animal Husbandry:**
  - **Fencing:** Enclose pastures (1 wood per fence). Each pasture holds one animal type, 2 animals per space.
  - **Stables:** Build for 2 wood. In a pasture, doubles its capacity. Unfenced stables hold 1 animal.
- **Cards:**
  - **Occupations:** Play for immediate effect; first is free, subsequent cost 1 Food.
  - **Improvements:** Pay cost to acquire; may have prerequisites. Major Improvements are shared; Minor Improvements are personal.
  - **Traveling Cards:** Passed to next player after use.
  - **Upgrade Cards:** Replace existing improvements.
