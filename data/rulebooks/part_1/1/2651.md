### 1. Lore & Objective
You are the head of a power company competing to supply electricity to the most cities. The goal is to strategically acquire power plants, purchase resources, and expand your network of cities. The winner is the player who can power the most cities at the end of the game.

### 2. Components
- Game board (Germany/USA map) with scoring track, player order track, and resource market
- 132 wooden houses (22 per player in 6 colors)
- 84 resource tokens:  
  - 24 coal (brown)  
  - 24 oil (black)  
  - 24 garbage (yellow)  
  - 12 uranium (red)
- Money (Elektro): denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50
- 42 power plant cards (numbered 03–50)
- 1 "Step 3" card
- 5 resource refill summary cards
- 6 payment summary cards
- Auction hammer and discount token
- Barriers for Step 2 and Game End

### 3. Setup
- **Map Selection**: Choose a contiguous zone of regions based on player count:
  - 2–3 players: 3 regions  
  - 4 players: 4 regions  
  - 5–6 players: 5 regions
- **Player Setup**: Each player receives:
  - 22 houses of one color  
  - $50 Elektro  
  - 1 house on scoring track (space 0)  
  - 1 house on player order track (random initial order)
- **Resource Market**:
  - Coal: 3 tokens each on spaces 1–8  
  - Oil: 3 tokens each on spaces 3–8  
  - Garbage: 3 tokens each on spaces 7–8  
  - Uranium: 1 token each on spaces 14 and 16
- **Power Plant Market**:
  - Place plants 03–06 in the "Actual Market" (top row)  
  - Place plants 07–10 in the "Future Market" (bottom row)
- **Draw Stack**:
  - Remove a number of random power plant cards face-down (based on player count: 8 for 2–3, 4 for 4, 0 for 5–6)  
  - Shuffle remaining cards  
  - Place power plant 13 face-down on top of the stack  
  - Place "Step 3" card face-down on the bottom of the stack  
  - Stack is placed next to the market

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds through five phases in order:

#### Phase 1: Determine Player Order
- Reorder players on the player order track by number of cities connected (most cities goes first).
- Tiebreaker: player with the highest-numbered power plant goes first.

#### Phase 2: Auction Power Plants
- Proceed in player order. Each player may:
  - **Choose a plant to auction**: Select any plant in the Actual Market. Minimum bid = plant number (or $1 if it has the discount token).
  - **Bid clockwise**: Players bid higher or pass. Passing removes you from that auction.
  - **Winner pays and takes plant**, then draws a replacement from the stack. Market is reordered numerically.
  - Player who wins places their house in the bottom row of player order; others remain in top row.
- If a player starts an auction but does not win, they may start another auction.
- A player may buy only one plant per round.
- **First round rule**: All players must buy a plant.
- **Discount token**: Starts on the cheapest plant in the Actual Market. Minimum bid = $1. If the plant is not bought, remove it and the token at the end of the phase.

#### Phase 3: Buy Resources
- Proceed in **reverse player order**.
- Players may buy resources for their power plants from the resource market.
- Price is shown on each space; cheapest available resources are bought first.
- A power plant can store up to **twice** the number of resources it needs to operate.
- Hybrid plants (coal/oil) can store any combination of coal and oil up to double the required amount.
- Ecological/fusion plants use no resources.

#### Phase 4: Building
- Proceed in **reverse player order**.
- Players may build houses in cities:
  - First house in a city: $10  
  - Second house: $15  
  - Third house: $20
- Connection cost: Pay the cheapest total route from an existing city in your network.
- You may pass through unoccupied or occupied cities without building.
- Update scoring track immediately after each new city.
- **Automatic removal**: If any player’s network size ≥ a plant number in the market, remove that plant and replace it.

#### Phase 5: Bureaucracy
1. **Earn Cash**:
   - In player order, each player declares how many cities they power (up to their plant capacity).
   - Income is based on number of cities powered (see payment table).
   - Discard required resources to supply.
   - Unused power is wasted.
   - Players with 0 powered cities receive $10 minimum.
2. **Resupply Resource Market**:
   - Based on player count and current Step, refill resources starting from the most expensive empty space.
   - Use the Resource Refill Summary Card.
   - If supply is exhausted, do not fully refill.
3. **Update Power Plant Market**:
   - **Steps 1–2**: Move highest-numbered plant from Future Market to bottom of draw stack. Draw a replacement.
   - **Step 3**: Remove the lowest-numbered plant from the market. Draw a replacement if possible.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Power Plants**:
  - Each has a number (minimum bid and tiebreaker), resource type(s), resource cost, and city capacity.
  - Maximum owned: 3 plants (2-player game: 4).
  - Buying a 4th (or 4th in 2p) requires discarding one. Resources may be moved to other plants if space allows.
- **Resource Storage**:
  - Standard: store up to 2× required resources.
  - Hybrid: store any mix of coal/oil up to 2× total required.
  - Ecological: no storage.
- **Plant Market Rules**:
  - Always sorted numerically.
  - In Steps 1–2: 4 in Actual Market, 4 in Future Market.
  - In Step 3: 6 plants total, all in Actual Market (no Future Market).
- **Step Triggers**:
  - **Step 2**: Begins at start of Phase 5 when any player builds:
    - 2 players: 10 cities  
    - 3–5 players: 7 cities  
    - 6 players: 6 cities
    - When triggered: remove lowest-numbered market plant and replace.
  - **Step 3**: Triggered when "Step 3" card is drawn:
    - **During Auction**: Place card at end of Future Market. After phase, remove it and lowest-numbered plant. No replacement.
    - **During Building or Bureaucracy**: Remove card and lowest-numbered plant. No replacement.
    - Shuffle remaining deck and place face-down.
    - Market now has 6 plants; all are auctionable.
- **Player Order**:
  - Determined each round by city count → highest plant number.
  - Auction: forward order. Resources and Building: reverse order.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **End Game Trigger**: Immediately after Phase 4, if any player has built:
  - 2 players: 21 cities  
  - 3–4 players: 17 cities  
  - 5 players: 15 cities  
  - 6 players: 14 cities
- **Final Scoring**:
  - Players determine how many cities they can power with current plants and resources.
  - Player who powers the most cities wins.
  - **Tiebreakers**:
    1. Most money
    2. Most cities in network
- **Note**: The player who triggered the end may not win if they cannot power all their cities.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **What if the draw stack is empty during Step 3?**
  - Continue removing the lowest-numbered plant each Phase 5. No replacement drawn.
- **Can you build multiple cities in one turn?**
  - Yes, as long as you can pay all connection and building costs.
- **Can you use a city built this turn to connect further?**
  - Yes. You may chain connections through newly built cities.
- **What happens if the "Step 3" card is drawn before Step 2?**
  - Trigger Step 2 first (if not already active), then immediately trigger Step 3.
- **Can you rearrange resources between plants?**
  - Yes, at any time, as long as the destination plant can store that resource type.
- **Do you earn money in the final Phase 5?**
  - No. The final Bureaucracy phase is skipped. Winner is determined by power capacity at end of Phase 4.
- **What if no one bids on a plant in Phase 2?**
  - If no plants are bought, remove the lowest-numbered plant from the market and replace it.
