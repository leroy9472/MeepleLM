## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Mansions of Madness: Second Edition is a cooperative, app-driven horror adventure game where investigators explore eerie locations, solve mysteries, and confront otherworldly threats. The scenario determines the objective, which is initially hidden. Investigators must uncover clues, complete puzzles, and survive supernatural dangers to succeed. Victory is achieved when the investigation is completed as defined by the scenario. However, individual investigators may have alternate or additional win conditions due to insanity effects.

2. Components  
- Investigator cards and figures  
- Monster cards and tokens (with stats: Awareness, Horror Rating, Brawn)  
- Map tiles (including overlapping and moving tiles in expansions)  
- Token pools: Search, Explore, Person, Interact, Fire, Barricade, Darkness, Rift, Water, Overgrowth, Rubble, Restraint, Key, Improvement, Elixir, Agenda  
- Decks: Damage, Horror, Common Items, Unique Items, Spells, Conditions, Elixirs (expansion), Agendas (expansion)  
- ID tokens (to differentiate unique monsters)  
- Clues (used for skill test modification and puzzle solving)  

3. Setup  
- Separate and organize decks: shuffle Damage and Horror decks; alphabetize item, spell, and condition decks.  
- Organize map tiles by size; group monsters with their tokens.  
- Launch the app, enable desired expansions, and select a scenario or continue a saved game.  
- Each player chooses an investigator, takes the corresponding card and figure, and inputs selection into the app. In solo play, choose 2 investigators.  
- Distribute starting possessions as instructed by the app.  
- Place starting map tile, investigators, and tokens as directed. Read the prologue.  
- Record progress if pausing: possessions, damage/horror, figure positions. The app saves board state automatically.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of two phases:  
1. **Investigator Phase**:  
   - Investigators take turns in any order.  
   - On a turn, perform up to 2 actions (same action may be used twice).  
   - After all turns, press END PHASE.  
2. **Mythos Phase**:  
   - App triggers Mythos events.  
   - App activates each monster (movement and attacks).  
   - App prompts horror checks: each investigator checks against the highest Horror Rating monster within range.  
   - Press END PHASE to begin next round.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Actions (up to 2 per turn)**:  
  - **Move**: Move up to 2 spaces. Movement can be split around other actions. Cannot move through walls or impassable borders unless allowed. Evade check required when leaving a space with a monster.  
  - **Search**: Tap a Search token in your space → SEARCH. Resolves via app.  
  - **Explore**: Tap an Explore token in your space or adjacent to a door → EXPLORE. Reveals new room.  
  - **Interact**: Tap a Person or Interact token → select action. Resolves via app.  
  - **Attack**: Select monster → ATTACK → choose attack type (Heavy, Bladed, Firearm, Spell, Unarmed).  
    - Melee: monster in same space.  
    - Ranged: within 3 spaces (cannot count through walls/doors).  
  - **Trade**: Trade possessions with investigators in your space; pick up/drop items in your space.  
  - **Push**: Push a monster or investigator to an adjacent space.  
    - Push monster: test Strength vs. monster’s Brawn.  
    - Push investigator: they test Strength; your difficulty = their result + 1.  
    - If successful, pushed figure moves 1 space; you may move 1 space toward them.  
  - **Steal**: Choose investigator in your space and skill (Strength, Agility, Observation). Both test skill. You gain 1 possession per excess success. If tied or worse, action fails.  
  - **Set Fire**: Requires a Light Source. Place Fire token in your space or adjacent space (if no fire already on board).  
  - **Extinguish Fire**: Test Agility. Discard 1 Fire token per success from your space or spaces you move into later in the round.  
  - **Move Barricade**: Move barricade in your space to block/unblock a door or Secret Passage.  
  - **Push Barricade**: Test Strength vs. barricade on other side of door/secret passage. On 2+ successes, move it away and move 1 space through.  
  - **Close Rift**: Test Lore. Discard 1 Rift token per success from your space or spaces you move into later in the round.  
  - **Remove Overgrowth**: Use a Bladed Weapon to discard all Overgrowth tokens in your space.  
  - **Remove Rubble**: Test Strength or use a Heavy Weapon to discard Rubble tokens.  
  - **General Component Action**: Perform actions listed on cards with "Action:" or action icon via app.  

- **Evading Monsters**:  
  - Required when leaving a monster’s space or performing non-Move/Attack action in it.  
  - Evade highest Awareness monster in space.  
  - Use app: select monster → EVADE.  
  - Failure may forfeit action or movement.

- **Skill Tests**:  
  - Roll dice = skill value (minimum 1).  
  - Spend 1 clue per 0 → convert to 1 .  
  - Test passes if successes ≥ difficulty (if specified).  
  - Used to negate damage/horror: prevent 1 per success.

- **Puzzles**:  
  - Solved via app. Types: Slide, Code, Lock, Tower, Line, Ring.  
  - Perform steps = skill value. Spend 1 clue per extra step.  
  - Progress saved if not completed.

- **Features**:  
  - **Barricades**: Block doors/secret passages. Investigators move them as action. Monsters destroy on 2+ Brawn successes.  
  - **Darkness**: Prevents clue spending and extra puzzle steps. Negated by Light Source or Fire.  
  - **Fire**:  
    - Investigators suffer 1 facedown damage when entering, acting (non-Move), or forfeiting action in fire.  
    - Monsters suffer 1 damage when starting activation or moving into fire.  
    - Spreads at start of each Mythos phase (1 token to adjacent space).  
  - **Secret Passages**: Connect spaces as if adjacent (if unblocked). Cannot count range through.  
  - **Rift**: After non-Move action or forfeited action, investigator becomes Lost in Time and Space. Close by testing Lore.  
  - **Water**: Stops movement (except Aquatic, Flying, Phasing monsters). Extinguishes fire.  
  - **Overgrowth**: Test Observation (difficulty = number of tokens) to exit. Bladed Weapon removes.  
  - **Rubble**: Prevents Search, Explore, Interact. Heavy Weapon or Strength test removes.  
  - **Restraint (Sanctum of Twilight)**: Monsters in space with restraint don’t need to be evaded. Group may discard restraint to stop monster movement.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Winning**: Complete the investigation as defined by the scenario.  
- **Losing**:  
  - All investigators eliminated.  
  - After an investigator is eliminated, remaining players get one more Investigator Phase. If investigation not complete, they lose.  
  - Scenario timer expires (objective becomes impossible).  
- **Insane Conditions**: May alter win conditions:  
  - **Neutral**: No change to win condition.  
  - **Additional Goal**: Complete investigation + personal goal (e.g., have spells, be not wounded).  
  - **Different Goal**: Win if investigation fails + personal goal (e.g., have 6+ items).  
  - **Sudden Victory**: Win immediately when condition met (e.g., 6+ rooms on fire, in space with one other with Bladed Weapon).  
- **Eliminated**: Drop all possessions, remove figure. Game ends after next Investigator Phase unless investigation complete.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Interrupting Movement**: You may Move 1 space → perform action → Move 1 space.  
- **Clue Spending**: Unlimited clues can be spent to convert dice or add puzzle steps.  
- **Facing**: Not tracked; movement and range are abstract.  
- **Multiple Effects**: Resolve in order presented by the app.  
- **Random Selection**: When choosing random facedown card, draw blindly.  
- **App Dependency**: All story, effects, and monster activation are app-controlled.  
- **Expansions**: Add new mechanics (e.g., moving tiles, elixirs, improvements, agendas) as described in setup.
