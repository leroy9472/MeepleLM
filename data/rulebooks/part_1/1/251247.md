### 3. Setup
1. Place the Energy Track, Management Board, Patent Office, and (if using expansion) Extra Management Board next to the Map.
2. Shuffle and place 4 Headstream Tiles faceup at the top of the Map.
3. Randomly place 5 Bonus Tiles faceup on the Energy Track.
4. Place 1 random Objective Tile at the end of the Energy Track.
5. Deal (player count -1) National Contracts faceup on the Contract Office.
6. Stack Private Contract Tiles into 3 facedown piles; display 2 faceup from each pile.
7. Draw one Neutral Dam Setup Tile per type (Mountains, Hills, Plains); place neutral dams accordingly and add 1 Water Drop behind each.
8. Stack Advanced Technology Tiles into 3 facedown piles; display 3 from the 'I' pile.
9. (Leeghwater) Stack External Work Tiles into 3 piles; display 3 from the 'A' pile.
10. (Leeghwater) Place 5 random Private Building Tiles faceup.
11. Randomly display Company Boards and Starting Contracts equal to player count; pair each with a random Executive Officer.
12. Randomly pick a first player. In clockwise order, each player selects a Company Board with matching Executive Officer and Starting Contract.
13. Each player takes:
   - 5 Bases, 5 Elevations, 5 Conduits, 4 Powerhouses (placed on Company Board)
   - (Leeghwater) 5 Buildings (placed on Extension Board)
   - 6 Credits, 6 Excavators, 4 Concrete Mixers
   - 12 Engineers, 1 Construction Wheel, 4 basic Technology Tiles (excluding wild tiles)
   - 1 Energy Marker (start at '30' on Energy Track, facedown)
   - 1 VP Marker (start at '10' on score track, facedown)
   - 1 Turn Order Token
14. Place Turn Order Markers on the Turn Order Track in reverse selection order.
15. (2–3 players) Place Engineers from unused companies on Action spaces with higher player count requirements.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 5 rounds. Each round consists of:
1. **Income and Headstreams Phase**: Gain income from uncovered icons; place water drops on Headstream Tiles.
2. **Action Phase**: Players take turns placing Engineers on action spaces to perform actions until all pass.
3. **Water Flow Phase**: All water drops flow down rivers, filling dams or exiting the board.
4. **Scoring Phase**: Score VPs based on Energy Track position, Bonus Tile, and Credit income.
5. **End of Round Phase**: Reset energy, update turn order, retrieve Engineers, refill tech tiles.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Construction Actions**: Use Technology Tiles and Machineries (Excavators/Concrete Mixers) on the Construction Wheel. Rotate the wheel to build Structures.
- **Structures**:
  - **Base**: Creates a dam (cost varies by terrain). Max one per basin per player.
  - **Elevation**: Increases dam capacity (built on Base). Max 3 levels (1 Base + 2 Elevations).
  - **Conduit**: Connects dam to powerhouse. Cost = 2 × production value in Excavators.
  - **Powerhouse**: Enables energy production. Max one per basin per player.
- **Production (Turbine Station)**:
  - Move water from your or neutral dam through a conduit to your powerhouse.
  - Energy = Water Drops × Conduit Value + Bonuses.
  - If using opponent’s conduit: pay 1 Credit and they gain 1 VP per drop.
  - May fulfill 1 Contract with this production.
- **Water Flow**: Water flows one drop at a time. Dams hold drops equal to their level. Full dams overflow.
- **Management Actions**:
  - **Water Management**: Place 2 drops on headstreams or 1 drop that flows immediately.
  - **Bank**: Gain 1 Credit per Engineer placed (unlimited).
  - **Workshop**: Rotate Construction Wheel by specified segments.
  - **Machinery Shop**: Pay Credits to gain Machineries.
  - **Contract Office**: Take 1 free or 2 for 1 Credit.
  - **Patent Office**: Pay 5 Credits to take an Advanced Technology Tile.
  - **External Works (Leeghwater)**: Discard Machineries to gain rewards.
  - **Private Buildings (Leeghwater)**: Build to unlock special actions.
- **Advanced Technology Tiles**: Grant special effects when used in construction (e.g., free placement, VP, resource gain).
- **Executive Officers**: Unique abilities (e.g., Wilhelm Adler: Bases always cost 3 Excavators; Dr. Octavius: Use multiple dams in one production).
- **Company Abilities**: Unlocked via Powerhouse construction (e.g., France: Fulfill contracts with 3 less energy; Germany: Second production action).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends after Round 5 Scoring Phase.
Final Scoring:
1. **Objective Tile**: Rank players based on condition. 1st: 15 VP, 2nd: 10 VP, 3rd: 5 VP. Ties: split points (round up).
2. **Resources**: 1 VP per 5 total of Excavators, Concrete Mixers, and Credits (in supply only).
3. **Water Drops**: 1 VP per Water Drop in personal dams.
4. **Private Buildings (Leeghwater)**: Score VP from activated buildings.
Tiebreaker: Most Energy produced in Round 5.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Tie for 1st on Energy Track**: Split 8 VP (6+2) among tied players (round up); no 2nd place.
- **Tie for 2nd**: All tied score 1 VP.
- **Red Border Costs**: Apply only when building on red-bordered spaces or using red-bordered action spaces.
- **Construction Wheel**: Resources return when segment reaches top after full rotation.
- **Multiple Dams in Production**: Only Dr. Octavius and Germany's ability allow this.
- **Neutral Dams**: Can be used by all players but cannot be modified.
- **Income**: Revealed immediately when building uncovers it; collected again each Income Phase.
- **End of Round Reset**: Energy reset to 0, but carry forward for turn order and bonuses.
