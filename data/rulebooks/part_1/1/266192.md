5. Core Mechanics  
**Action: Play a Bird**  
1. Select a bird card from hand.  
2. Choose habitat (forest, grassland, wetland) matching the bird’s habitat(s).  
3. Place action cube above the leftmost empty column in that habitat.  
4. Pay egg cost: discard eggs from any birds equal to column cost (0 for col 1, 1 for cols 2–3, 2 for cols 4–5).  
5. Pay food cost: discard food tokens matching bird’s cost.  
   - Wild (●) = any food  
   - OR (slash) = choose one  
   - No food (⊘) = none required  
   - Any 2 food tokens = 1 of any type (only during this action)  
6. Place bird card in leftmost empty slot of chosen habitat.  
7. If bird has “WHEN PLAYED” (white) power, activate it (optional).  

**Action: Gain Food**  
1. Place action cube in leftmost exposed slot of Forest row.  
2. Gain food tokens equal to number of ● icons shown: remove that many dice from birdfeeder, gain matching food.  
   - Dual-face die (e.g., worm/seed): choose one.  
3. Optional: if slot shows card-to-food bonus (⇒), discard 1 bird card to gain 1 additional food from remaining dice.  
4. Activate brown “WHEN ACTIVATED” powers on forest birds, right to left (optional).  
5. Move action cube to far left of row.  

**Action: Lay Eggs**  
1. Place action cube in leftmost exposed slot of Grassland row.  
2. Gain eggs equal to number of 0 icons shown.  
   - Distribute among birds, up to each bird’s egg limit (shown on card).  
   - Excess eggs are lost.  
3. Optional: if slot shows food-to-egg bonus (⊞⇒0), pay 1 food to gain 1 additional egg.  
4. Activate brown “WHEN ACTIVATED” powers on grassland birds, right to left (optional).  
5. Move action cube to far left of row.  

**Action: Draw Bird Cards**  
1. Place action cube in leftmost exposed slot of Wetland row.  
2. Draw cards equal to number of ■ icons shown.  
   - Choose from face-up tray cards or top of deck.  
   - Do not refill tray until end of turn.  
3. Optional: if slot shows egg-to-card bonus (0⇒■), discard 1 egg to draw 1 additional card.  
4. Activate brown “WHEN ACTIVATED” powers on wetland birds, right to left (optional).  
5. Move action cube to far left of row.  

**Managing the Birdfeeder**  
- If birdfeeder is empty, roll all 5 dice back in.  
- If all dice in birdfeeder show the same face (including if only 1 die), and you are about to gain food, you may re-roll all 5 dice.  
- The dual-face die (●) counts as its own unique face.  

**Bird Powers**  
- **Brown (WHEN ACTIVATED)**: Trigger during Gain Food, Lay Eggs, or Draw Cards actions, right to left. Optional.  
- **White (WHEN PLAYED)**: Trigger only when bird is played. Optional.

- **Tuck**: Place bird card face-down under another. Worth 1 VP at game end.  
- **Flocking**: Build a flock by tucking cards under a bird. Each tucked card = 1 VP.  
- **Hunting/Fishing**: Gain a token (e.g., rodent, fish) from supply; worth 1 VP.  

**Nest Types**  
- Platform, Bowl, Cavity, Ground  
- ★ = wild nest; counts as any nest type for goals, powers, and bonus cards.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
After Round 4:  
1. Points from each bird card (printed value).  
2. Points from each completed bonus card.  
3. Points from end-of-round goals (4 total, one per round).  
4. 1 point each for:  
   - Egg on a bird card  
   - Food token cached on a bird card  
   - Bird card tucked under another bird card  

**End-of-Round Goal Scoring**  
- **Green (Majority)**:  
  - Rank players by quantity of target item.  
  - 1st: 5 pts, 2nd: 2 pts, 3rd: 1 pt (varies by tile).  
  - Ties: combine points of tied and next place(s), divide by number of tied players, round down.  
  - 4th/5th: 0 pts (but must place cube).  
- **Blue (Item Count)**:  
  - 1 pt per item, max 5 pts.  
  - Must place cube even with 0.  

**Tiebreaker**  
- Most unused food tokens wins.  
- If still tied, victory is shared.
