# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The Automa is an AI opponent designed for solo and 2-player games of Gaia Project. It follows a scripted decision-making process using an Automa deck to simulate strategic behavior. The goal of the Automa is to score Victory Points (VP) through actions, passing, and end-game scoring, competing against human players.

## 2. Components
- Automa Decision Cards (numbered 1–15)
- Automa Faction Cards (e.g., Terrans, Firaks, Geodens, etc.)
- Player token (for VP and research tracks)
- Mines, satellites, and other structures as needed
- Automa deck and discard pile

## 3. Setup
### Automa Initial Setup
- Place 1 player token on the 10 VP space (0 VP if using Automalein difficulty).
- Place 1 player token on level 0 of each research area.
- Follow faction-specific setup on the Automa faction card (e.g., Firaks start at level 1 in "Gaia Project").
- Place Automa's two or three starting mines on its home planet type nearest the center of the board. Use "Directional Selection" from a random Automa card to break ties.

### Build the Automa Deck
- Start with 6 specific Automa decision cards (as listed on the faction card).
- Add 1 random card from the remaining deck.
- Total deck size: 7 cards.
- Rotate the bottom 3 cards 90 degrees (perpendicular) to indicate end-of-round passing trigger.

#### Difficulty Variants:
- **Automalein**: Remove card #2 from the game.
- **Automächtig**: Add card #9 to the starting deck.
- **Ultoma / Alptrauma**: Add cards #9 and #15 to the starting deck.
- **Alptrauma only**: Automa gains +1 VP whenever it gains VP (except end-of-game scoring).

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds in player turns. When it is the Automa’s turn:
1. **First Turn of the Round**:
   - Draw 2 cards: one action card (left), one support card (right).
2. **Subsequent Turns**:
   - Discard the support card.
   - Slide the action card to become the new support card.
   - Draw a new card as the action card.
     - If the drawn card is one of the bottom 3 (perpendicular) cards **and** has a red X in the passing section, the Automa passes. Turn ends.
     - Otherwise, place it as the new action card.
3. **Take Action**:
   - Perform the action shown on the action card.
   - Gain VP from the action card or faction card.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Automa Actions
#### Action: Upgrade
- **Valid Structures** (priority order):
  1. Planetary Institute (from Trading Station)
  2. Trading Station (from Mine)
  3. Academy (from Research Lab)
  4. Research Lab (from Trading Station)
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Closest to Automa’s planets.
  2. Directional selection (from support card).
- **Execute**: Replace structure accordingly.

#### Action: Build a Mine
- **Condition**: Mine available in supply.
- **Valid Planets**: Empty, within range (including Transdim Planets).
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Faction action tiebreaker (if applicable).
  2. Final scoring tiebreaker (if applicable).
  3. Fewest terraforming steps (Gaia = 1, Transdim = 2).
  4. Closest to Automa’s planets.
  5. Directional selection.
- **Execute**:
  a. Place mine.
  b. If not adjacent to another Automa structure, place a satellite in an adjacent non-planet hex.

> If unable to build a mine, perform an Upgrade instead.

#### Action: Power/Q.I.C. Actions
- **Valid Actions**: Any unused Power or Q.I.C. action.
- **Tiebreaker**: Numbered selection on support card.
- **Execute**: Place action token on chosen space. Automa gains no benefit.

#### Action: Advance Research Area
- **Valid Areas**: Any research area where Automa can advance or an advanced tech tile is available.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Highest current research level (Advance Highest Research).
  2. Numbered selection (Advance Random Research).
- **Execute**:
  a. If at level 4 and advanced tech tile is available, remove the tile (does not advance to level 5).
  b. Otherwise, advance 1 level.
- **Note**: Automa does **not** need to flip a federation token to reach level 5.

#### Action: Faction Action
Each Automa faction has a unique action:

- **Firaks**:
  1. Advance in "Gaia Project" research.
  2. Build a mine with range 4; tiebreaker favors Transdim Planet.
  - Gain 2 VP after action.

- **Terrans**:
  1. Upgrade with priority:
     1. Planetary Institute
     2. Trading Station (downgrade from Research Lab)
     3. Trading Station (upgrade from Mine)
     4. Academy
     5. Research Lab
  - Gain 2 VP after action.
  - **Ongoing**: After upgrading to Research Lab, take an "Advance Random Research" action.

- **Geodens**:
  1. Advance random research area.
  2. Take a Power/Q.I.C. action.
  - Gain 1 VP after action.
  - **Ongoing**: When building first mine on a planet type, gain +2 VP.

- **Hadsch Hallas**:
  1. Upgrade; if impossible, build mine with range 3.
  - Gain 1 VP after action.
  - **Ongoing**: After upgrading to Trading Station, gain +3 VP.

- **Xenos**:
  1. Build mine with range 2.
  2. Take a Power/Q.I.C. action (does **not** trigger ongoing ability).
  - Gain 2 VP after action.
  - **Ongoing**: When taking a Power/Q.I.C. action (not during faction action), resolve it twice (skip already taken action the second time).

- **Taklons**:
  1. Build mine with range 3; tiebreaker favors shortest distance to player’s planet.
  2. Take a Power/Q.I.C. action.
  - Gain 2 VP after action.

> Automa gains VP as specified after resolving the full faction action.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### During Game
- Automa gains VP:
  - From action cards (specified on card).
  - From faction actions (as described).
  - From round scoring tiles when passing.
  - **Alptrauma only**: +1 VP whenever it gains VP (not during end game).

### Automa Passing Procedure
When Automa passes:
1. Score VP from current round scoring tile:
   - Rounds 1–3: left number.
   - Rounds 4–6: right number.
2. Take the round booster indicated on the **support card**.
3. Place the old round booster to the right of the remaining boosters.
4. Rebuild Automa deck:
   - Collect all Automa cards used this round.
   - Add 1 random new card.
   - Shuffle and place into new deck.
   - Rotate bottom 3 cards 90 degrees.
5. If Automa passed before the human player, it takes the first player token.

### Final Scoring
Same as human players:
- **Final Scoring Tiles**: Score based on ranking (1st: 18 VP, 2nd: 12 VP, 3rd: 6 VP, 4th: 0 VP). Ties: pool points and divide.
- **Research Scoring**: 4 VP for each level 3, 4, or 5 reached in any research area.
- **Resource Scoring**: 1 VP per 3 total of credits, knowledge, and ore (combined).
- **Federation Structures**: Automa’s number of structures in federations = total structures – 1 (for scoring purposes).

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Empty Automa Deck**: If deck is empty when drawing, Automa passes immediately.
- **Cannot Perform Action**: If action is impossible (e.g., no mines to build), perform the next valid action in priority (e.g., Upgrade instead of Build Mine).
- **Tiebreakers**: Always use support card for tiebreakers (directional or numbered).
- **Satellite Placement**: Only placed when mine is not adjacent to another Automa structure. Counts for "Most Satellites" final scoring.
- **Transdim Planets**: When building a mine on a Transdim planet, place a Gaia Planet token (Automa does not use Gaiaformers).
- **Advanced Tech Tiles**: Automa removes the tile when advancing from level 4 to 5; does **not** gain a tech tile when upgrading to Research Lab or Academy.
