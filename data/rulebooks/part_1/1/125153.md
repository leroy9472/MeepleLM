   - Shuffle 16 Artist tiles and place them on matching spaces (1 blue, 1 red per art form: painting, sculpture, digital, photography).
   - Place 1 Artist face-up (initial fame marked with a white cube); all others face-down.
   - Place a random bonus tile on each artist; place a white Collector on each red artist.
   - Place both of each artist’s Signature tokens beside their tile.
   - Shuffle each art form’s Work of Art stack and place face-up beside the matching artist; place a number of random visitors (from the bag) on each topmost artwork equal to its ticket value.

8. Place 4 Visitors in the Plaza and 1 in each player’s Lobby.
9. Place 1 Reputation tile next to each Location.

11. Each player takes 10 money and 1 random Art Dealer and Curator card (kept secret).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Play proceeds clockwise starting with the Start Player.
- On a turn, a player:
  1. Picks up their Gallerist from its current Location.
  2. Optionally leaves an Assistant (from office or another location) on the vacated space (cannot leave on home space or black "Kicked-Out" spaces).
  3. Moves Gallerist to a different white Location space.
  4. If another player’s Gallerist or Assistant is present, that piece is moved to the black Kicked-Out space beside the location.
  5. Must perform one of the two main actions at the new Location.
  6. May perform one Executive Action (before or after the main action).
  7. After the turn, any Kicked-Out player may take a Kicked-Out Action.
- Play continues until two endgame conditions are met. Then, finish the current round, play one final round (no Kicked-Out actions), and proceed to Final Scoring.
