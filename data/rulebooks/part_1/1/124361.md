### 3. Setup  

#### Board Setup  
1. Choose board side:  
   - Imperium (3–5 players): 12 provinces, 30 cities  
   - Italia (2–4 players): 11 provinces, 25 cities  
2. Randomly place city tokens on cities with matching letters (A–D); flip face-up to show goods.  
3. For each province, determine the most valuable good (by value: cloth 7 > wine 6 > tool 5 > food 4 > brick 3). Place matching bonus marker in province box (goods side up).  
4. Prepare card decks:  
   - Remove decks with Roman numerals greater than player count (e.g., 2 players use only decks I and II).  
   - Shuffle each deck separately, then stack with I on top, II below, etc.  
   - Draw top 7 cards to form the display row.  
5. Place Concordia card and Praefectus Magnus card beside the board.

#### Player Setup

- 1 land colonist and 1 sea colonist placed in Roma

- 2 food, 1 cloth, 1 wine, 1 brick, 1 tool in storehouse (2 empty spaces)  
- 15 wooden houses  
- 7 starting personality cards  
- Scoring marker on 0 VP  
Randomly choose starting player:  
- 1st player: 5 sestertii  
- 2nd: 6 sestertii, ..., last: (5 + player position) sestertii  
- Last player receives Praefectus Magnus card

### 4. Gameplay Flow

1. Play one personality card from hand.  
2. Execute its action(s).  
3. Place card face-up on personal discard pile.  
Turn ends. Play passes to next player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Storehouse  
- 12 spaces; each holds 1 colonist **or** 1 good unit.  
- Colonists in storehouse occupy space; when placed on board, space becomes available for goods.  
- Cannot discard goods to make space.  
- If receiving more goods than available space, player chooses which to keep.  
- No trading between players. Goods and coins are unlimited.  

#### Personality Cards  

**Architect**  
1. **Move colonists**:  
   - Total movement steps = number of colonists on board.  
   - Land colonists move on brown lines; sea on blue.  
   - First step: from city onto adjacent line.  
   - Can move through occupied lines; cannot end on same line as another colonist.  
2. **Build houses** (after all movement):  
   - May build in any city adjacent to your colonists.  
   - Cannot build in Roma.  
   - Only one house per city per player.  
   - Cost:  
     - Goods: 1 food (brick city); 1 brick + 1 city-type good (other cities)  
     - Coins: brick=1, food=2, tool=3, wine=4, cloth=5  
     - **Coin cost multiplied by total number of houses in city after build** (e.g., building 3rd house: ×3). Goods cost unchanged.  

**Prefect** (choose one)  
- **Produce**:  
  - Choose a province with bonus marker showing goods (not coins).  
  - Take 1 unit of bonus good (2 if holding Praefectus Magnus). Flip marker to coin side.  
  - All players with houses in province receive 1 good per house (city-type).  
  - Pass Praefectus Magnus to player on right.  
- **Reset**:  
  - Collect coins equal to sum of visible coin sides on all bonus markers.  
  - Flip all markers back to goods side.  
  - Praefectus Magnus not triggered.  

**Mercator**  
1. Gain 3 sestertii (5 if card was purchased, not starting).  
2. Choose two types of goods. May buy, sell, or do both with those types.  
   - Trade at prices: brick=3, food=4, tool=5, wine=6, cloth=7  
   - Limited by storehouse space.  
   - Cannot trade salt.  

**Senator**  
- Purchase up to 2 cards from display.  
- Cost = goods on card (red field) + goods below card position (question mark = any good).  
- Cards go to hand.  
- After purchase(s), shift remaining cards left; refill display to 7 from deck.  

**Consul**  
- Purchase 1 card from display.  
- Pay only goods on card (red field); ignore cost below card position.  
- Shift cards left; refill display.  

**Diplomat**  
- Copy action of top card on another player’s discard pile.  
- Cannot copy Diplomat or Tribune.  
- If copying Prefect and holding Praefectus Magnus: trigger double bonus and pass card.  

**Tribune**  
1. **Recover cards**: Take all from discard pile into hand.  
   - If more than 3 cards recovered (including Tribune), gain 1 sestertius per card beyond 3.  
2. **Optional**: Pay 1 food + 1 tool to place 1 colonist (land or sea) from storehouse into Roma.  

**Colonist** (choose one)  
- **Build colonists**: Pay 1 food + 1 tool per colonist. Place in Roma or any city where you have a house.  
- **Cash bonus**: Gain 5 + 1 sestertius per colonist on board.  

**Specialist (Mason, Farmer, Smith, Vintner, Weaver)**  
- Produce 1 unit of matching good per house you have in cities of that type.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End Trigger  
Game ends when:  
- A player purchases the last card from the display, **or**  
- A player builds their 15th house.  
That player receives the **Concordia card** (+7 VP).  
All other players take **one final turn**.  

#### Final Scoring  
Group all cards (hand + discard) by god at bottom. Score each god separately:  

- **Vesta**:  
  - Sell all goods at face value (brick=3, food=4, tool=5, wine=6, cloth=7).  
  - Add to cash. Score 1 VP per full 10 sestertii (round down).  

- **Jupiter**:  
  - 1 VP per house in **non-brick** city.  
  - Max 15 VP per card.  

- **Saturnus**:  
  - 1 VP per province with ≥1 house.  
  - Max: 12 VP (Imperium), 11 VP (Italia) per card.

  - Count each type once. Max 10 VP per card.  

- **Mars**:  
  - 2 VP per colonist on board.  
  - Max 12 VP per card.

    - Smith (tool): 3 VP per city  
    - Vintner (wine): 4 VP per city  
    - Weaver (cloth): 5 VP per city
