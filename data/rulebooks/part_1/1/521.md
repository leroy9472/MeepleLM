## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Crokinole is a precision flicking game believed to have originated in 1876 in Perth County, Ontario, Canada, with the earliest known board crafted by Eckhardt Wettlaufer as a gift for his son. The game evolved from 19th-century British and South Asian games like shuffleboard, shove ha'penny, and carrom. The name "crokinole" likely derives from the French word *croquignole*, meaning "to flick" or "snap" with the finger.

The objective is to score points by flicking wooden discs across a circular board into high-scoring zones (20, 15, 10, or 5 points), while also knocking opponents’ discs into lower-scoring areas or out of play (into the ditch). The game ends when a player or team reaches a predetermined score (typically 100) or wins a set number of scoring rounds.

2. Components  
- Circular board (standard 26 inches in diameter) with a 2-inch outer ditch  
- Four concentric scoring zones:  
  - Center hole: 20 points  
  - Inner ring (surrounded by 8 pegs): 15 points  
  - Middle ring: 10 points  
  - Outer ring: 5 points  
  - Area between outer ring and ditch: 0 points (out of play)  
- 24 discs (12 per side), typically in two distinct colors  
  - Singles: 8 discs per player  
  - Doubles: 6 discs per player (12 per team)  
- Granular shuffleboard wax (placed in ditch for optional disc treatment)  
- Optional: third set of 12 discs for 3-player variant  

3. Setup  
- Players or teams are assigned seating, disc color, and starting order by chance or tournament organizer.  
- For 2 players: sit opposite each other, each with 12 discs (or 8 per NCA rules).  
- For 4 players: partners sit opposite each other, each player has 6 discs (12 per team).  
- For 3 players:  
  - Option 1: Two vs. one — partners split 12 discs (6 each), solo player has 12 discs.  
  - Option 2: Each player has 12 discs; third color required.  
- All discs are placed outside the board before play.  
- First player is determined randomly. In subsequent rounds, starting order rotates clockwise.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- A **round** consists of all players shooting all their discs, one at a time, clockwise.  
- A **game** consists of 4 rounds (in NCA-sanctioned play).  
- A **match** may consist of multiple games, depending on tournament rules.  
- Turn order:  
  1. Player places disc flat, touching or behind their quadrant’s outer boundary line (no more than halfway over quadrant dividers).  
  2. Waits for all motion from previous turn to stop.  
  3. Flicks disc with finger (index or middle), using thumb as fulcrum.  
  4. After shot:  
     - If valid: disc and any moved discs remain.  
     - If invalid: shooter’s disc and any discs it touched are removed to ditch.  
  5. Any disc fully in 20-hole is removed immediately and set aside.  
- After all discs are shot, scoring occurs.  
- Discs are cleared; next round begins.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Valid Shot Requirements**:  
  - If **opponent discs are on board**: shooter must make direct or indirect contact (via chain reaction) with at least one opponent disc.  
  - If **no opponent discs on board** ("open table"): shooter’s disc or a disc it strikes must end up touching or within the 15-point ring (including 20-hole). This is the "No Hiding Rule".  
- **Invalid Shot Penalty**: Shooter’s disc and all discs it touched (including 20s made) are removed and do not score.  
- **Out of Bounds**:  
  - If disc touches or crosses outer boundary, it is out of play and placed in ditch.  
  - **Spinning Disc Rule**: If disc crosses boundary but strikes only playing surface and returns under its own momentum, it remains in play.  
  - **Damage Stays Rule**: If disc crosses boundary, hits backboard or out-of-play disc, and re-enters, it is out of play, but all changes to other discs (including 20s scored) remain.  
- **Shooting Rules**:  
  - Only shooting hand, wrist, and forearm may touch board.  
  - Shooter must remain seated ("one cheek rule"), chair legs on floor, no other body contact with floor.  
  - No distractions during opponent’s turn.  
  - Disc must be flicked with finger; no aids (e.g., guards or cues) allowed.  
  - Shot is official once disc leaves finger.  
- **Wax**: Players may rub discs in wax in ditch. Only officials may apply wax to board.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After all discs are shot:  
  - Score all discs remaining on board.  
  - Add discs removed from 20-hole to owner’s total.  
- Scoring Rules:  
  - Disc touching a line scores the **lower** value of the two adjacent regions.  
  - To score 20, disc must be **completely in** and **lying flat** in center hole.  
  - Bottom edge of disc determines line contact (not visual edge from above).  
- **Round Scoring**:  
  - Total each player/team’s points.  
  - Subtract lower total from higher.  
  - Higher scorer adds difference to game total; lower scorer gets 0 for the round.  
- **End Game Conditions** (choose before play):  
  1. First to **100 points** wins.  
  2. After 4 rounds, highest total wins.  
  3. **Match Play**: Winner of each round gets 2 points; tie = 1 point each. First to **8 points** wins.  
- **Tiebreakers (Tournament)**:  
  - Each tied player/team takes 8 shots (4 per player in doubles).  
  - Only 20-hole counts (1 point per).  
  - Highest score wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you score with opponent’s disc?** Yes — if opponent’s disc goes in 20-hole due to your shot, it counts for them.  
- **Can you combo your own disc into opponent?** Yes — indirect contact via your own disc is valid.  
- **What if all discs are cleared?** Next shot must reach 15-ring or be removed.  
- **Chair movement?** Only allowed to retrieve fallen disc; board and chair otherwise immovable.  
- **Timing in tournaments?** If time runs out, one extra shot allowed to equalize turns.  
- **Coaching**: Singles — not allowed. Doubles — only by partner.  
- **Three-player scoring**:  
  - 1st place: 2 points  
  - 2nd place: 1 point  
  - 3rd: 0  
  - Tie for 1st: each gets 1 point; 2nd gets 0  
  - Tie for 2nd: both get 0; 1st gets 2
