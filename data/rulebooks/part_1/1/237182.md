### 1. Lore & Objective
In the woodland, multiple factions vie for control. The first player to reach 30 victory points (VP) wins immediately. Alternatively, a player may win by activating a dominance card (if they have at least 10 VP) and fulfilling its condition at the start of their Birdsong.

### 2. Components
- **Faction Boards**: Unique boards for each faction.
- **Pieces**: Warriors (wooden), buildings (square), tokens (circular), pawns, items, and markers.
- **Cards**: 54-card shared deck with suits (mouse, rabbit, fox, bird). Bird cards are wild.
- **Special Components**: Dominance cards (4), ambush cards (5), ruins, crafting pieces (e.g., workshops, roosts), and map with 12 clearings.

### 3. Setup
1. Each player chooses a faction and takes its board and pieces.
2. Place score markers at 0 on the score track.
3. Deal 3 cards to each player.
4. Place 4 ruins on marked slots on the map.
5. Set up item supply: 2 boots, 2 swords, 1 bag, 1 hammer, 2 coins, 2 crossbows, 2 torches.
6. Place faction-specific starting pieces per faction rules (e.g., Marquise places keep, warriors, and buildings).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn has three phases:
1. **Birdsong**: Faction-specific actions (e.g., Marquise places wood, Eyrie adds to Decree).
2. **Daylight**: Perform actions (e.g., move, battle, craft, build). Players may take up to 3 actions (Marquise can gain more with bird cards).
3. **Evening**: Draw cards, discard down to 5, and resolve end-of-turn effects.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Move**: Move warriors between adjacent clearings. Must rule origin or destination.
- **Rule a Clearing**: Have more warriors and buildings than any other player. Tokens and pawns do not count.
- **Battle**:
  1. Attacker chooses a clearing with warriors and a defender.
  2. Defender may play an ambush card (matching clearing’s suit). Attacker may cancel with a matching ambush.
  3. Roll two dice. Attacker deals hits equal to higher roll, defender to lower. Max hits = number of warriors.
  4. If defender is defenseless (no warriors), attacker gets +1 hit.
  5. Deal hits simultaneously. Remove warriors first, then buildings/tokens. Score 1 VP per enemy building/token removed.
- **Crafting**: Activate crafting pieces (e.g., workshops, roosts) in clearings matching the card’s crafting cost (bottom-left). Each piece used once per turn. Craft items for VP or persistent effects.
- **Dominance Cards**: Spend 10+ VP to activate. Win by ruling specified clearings at start of Birdsong. Available dominance cards can be taken by spending a matching suit card.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Scoring**:
  - 1 VP for each enemy building/token removed (in battle or otherwise).
  - VP from crafting items (listed on card).
  - Faction-specific methods (e.g., Marquise scores when building, Eyrie from roosts).
- **Win Conditions**:
  - Reach 30 VP.
  - Activate dominance card (≥10 VP) and fulfill its condition at start of Birdsong.
- **End Game**: Game ends immediately when a player wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Ambush**: Only one ambush card per battle. Can be played even if defenseless.
- **Crafting Limits**: Cannot craft if item is out of supply or duplicate persistent effect exists.
- **Tie for Rule**: Neither player rules the clearing.
- **Vagabond**: Pawn is not a warrior; cannot be removed. Moves regardless of rule.
- **Eyrie Turmoil**: If unable to complete Decree, lose VP, discard Decree (except Viziers), change leader, and end turn.
