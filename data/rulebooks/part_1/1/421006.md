## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-Earth*, two players compete for control of Middle-earth. One plays as the Fellowship of the Ring, striving to destroy the One Ring by guiding Frodo and Sam to Mount Doom. The other plays as Sauron, seeking to intercept the Ring-bearers and dominate all of Middle-earth.

The game is won immediately if any of the following three victory conditions are met:  
- **Quest of the Ring**:  
  - Fellowship wins if Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom.  
  - Sauron wins if the Nazgûl catches Frodo and Sam.  
- **Support of the Races**: A player collects 6 different Race symbols on their Green cards.  
- **Conquering Middle-earth**: A player has a Unit or Fortress in all 7 regions of the map.

If no victory condition is met by the end of Chapter 3, the player present in the most regions wins. In case of a tie, the game is shared.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Sauron takes the first turn; players alternate.  
- On your turn, choose **one** action:  
  A. **Take a Chapter Card**  
  B. **Take a Landmark Tile**

#### A. Take a Chapter Card  
Choose an **available** card (not covered). Then:  
- **Play it in front of you**:  
  - Pay any cost in Coins and/or Skills.  
  - Skills not present may be paid at 1 Coin per missing symbol.  
  - Apply immediate effect.  
  - Stack by color; keep effects visible.  
- **OR Discard it**:  
  - Gain Coins from reserve:  
    - Chapter 1: 1 Coin  
    - Chapter 2: 2 Coins  
    - Chapter 3: 3 Coins  
- End turn by revealing any newly uncovered cards.

#### B. Take a Landmark Tile  
Choose a **faceup** Landmark tile.  
- Pay its cost:  
  - **Coin cost**: Base cost + additional cost = number of your Fortresses already on board.  
  - **Skill cost**: As shown on tile. Pay 1 Coin per missing Skill.  
- Place tile in your play area.  
- Immediately:  
  - Place a Fortress pawn in the region shown.  
  - Apply unique effect (see Player Aid).  
- **Do not** reveal a new tile after this action.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card & Tile Costs  
- **Coins**: Paid to reserve.  
- **Skills**: Required symbols (Ruse, Strength, Courage, Knowledge, Leadership).  
  - 1 Coin = 1 missing Skill.  
  - No limit on Skill payments per turn.  
- **No cost** = free play.

#### Chaining (Chapter 2 and 3)  
- Cards with a chaining symbol (top-right) may be played **for free** if you have a card in your play area with a matching symbol.  
- If no match, play normally (pay Skills/Coins).  
- Example: Play a Green card with chaining symbol → later play another Green card with matching chain for free.

#### Card Effects by Color  
- **Grey**: Gain Skills (1 per symbol).  
  - Symbols separated by /: choose one per turn.  
- **Yellow**: Gain Coins (from reserve).  
  - Can substitute for Skills (1 Coin = 1 Skill).  
- **Blue**: Move character on Quest track (1 space per Ring symbol).  
  - Pass Bonus space? Gain its effect (e.g., extra Coin, turn).  
- **Green**: Race alliance.  
  - Enables Alliance token acquisition.  
- **Red**: Place Units.  
  - Choose 1 of 2 regions shown.  
  - Place all Units in chosen region.  
- **Purple** (Chapter 3 only): Special actions:  
  - Move 1 Unit to adjacent region  
  - Remove 1 enemy Unit  
  - Opponent loses 1 Coin  

#### Landmark Tile Effects  
Place Fortress in region and apply unique effect:  
- **Barad-dûr**: Place Fortress in Mordor. Secretly choose 1 card from discard, play for free.  
- **Bree**: Place Fortress + 2 Units in Arnor. Complete 2 movements.  
- **Erebor**: Place Fortress in Rhovanion. Take 5 Coins. Complete 1 movement.  
- **Grey Havens**: Place Fortress in Lindon. Take top 2 tokens of any Race, keep 1.  
- **Helm’s Deep**: Place Fortress + 3 Units in Rohan.  
- **Isengard**: Place Fortress in Enedwaith. Discard 1 Grey card from opponent. Move 1 space.  
- **Minas Tirith**: Place Fortress + 1 Unit in Gondor. Move 2 spaces.

#### Race Alliance Mechanics  
- **2 Matching Race Symbols** (on Green cards):  
  - Take top 2 Alliance tokens of that Race.  
  - Reveal both, choose 1 to keep, return other facedown.  
- **3 Different Race Symbols** (once per game):  
  - Take top token from each of 3 Races.  
  - Reveal all, choose 1 to keep, return others facedown.  
- A single symbol may be used in both conditions.  
- **Eagle symbol** (on some tokens) counts as a Race for Support victory.

#### Conquering & Conflict  
- **Conflict**: Triggered when placing/moving Units into a region with enemy Units.  
  - Each player removes one Unit. Repeat until one side has no Units.  
  - Fortresses do **not** trigger conflict.  
- **Movement**:  
  - Move one Unit per movement action to adjacent region.  
  - Resolve each movement and any conflict immediately.  
  - Same Unit may move multiple times.  
- **Conquest Victory**: Be present (Unit or Fortress) in all 7 regions.

#### Quest of the Ring  
- Fellowship: Move Frodo and Sam.  
- Sauron: Move Nazgûl (on top of Frodo/Sam piece).  
- Distance can only decrease.  
- Pass Bonus space? Gain effect (e.g., Coin, extra turn).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Immediate win conditions (trigger when met):  
1. **Quest of the Ring**:  
   - Fellowship: Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom.  
   - Sauron: Nazgûl catches Frodo and Sam.  
2. **Support of the Races**: Own 6 different Race symbols on Green cards.  
3. **Conquering Middle-earth**: Present in all 7 regions.
