  - To Bank (Hazard/Outlaw)
  - To Player (opponent's Building)
- If you reach Kansas City, end Phase A immediately.

#### PHASE B: Use Location Action
Actions depend on location:

- **Neutral or Own Building**: Use Tile Actions (in any order) OR 1 single Auxiliary Action.
- **Opponent's Building or Hazard/Outlaw**: Only 1 single Auxiliary Action.
- **Kansas City**: Perform all 5 subphases:
  1. **Foresight**: Choose one tile from each of the three Foresight columns and place it in its section (Hazard, Outlaw, Worker).
  2. **Worker Placement**: Workers go to Job Market row with Job Market Token. If placed on Token space, move Token down.
  3. **Trigger Effects**:

     - Gain $ equal to Breeding Value.
     - Discard entire hand.
     - Simmental: Trash stage 1/2 cards, gain next stage.
     - Brahman: Gain $4 per Brahman card (not added to Breeding Value).
  5. **Delivery**:

#### Place a Building
- Choose unplaced Building.
- Place on empty space or replace own Building.
- Cost: $2 per Builder required.
- Minimum Builders must be on your board.
- Replacing: Pay difference in cost and Builders.
- Removed Building is trashed.
- Some spaces grant extra actions (e.g., discard Grey Cattle to move Certificate Marker).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Movement**: Herder moves along Trail; Engine moves on Railroad.
- **Certificates**: Temporary (spent from track) and Permanent (from Station Master Tiles) boost Breeding Value.
- **Delivery**: Requires Breeding Value ≥ City Value; transport cost based on Engine position.
- **Building Placement**: Strategic use of Builders; replacement allows higher-cost buildings.
- **Branchlets (Rails to the North)**: Expand network to unlock Town Squares.
- **Objective Cards**: Flexible acquisition and timing for immediate and endgame benefits.
- **Exchange Token**: Draw 2 cards, discard 2 (usable anytime).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **End Game Trigger**: Job Market Token moves off bottom row → triggering player takes it. Each other player takes one final turn.
- **Final Scoring**:
  1. $5 → 1 VP
  2. Cattle Cards → VP as printed
  3. Buildings → VP as printed
  4. Objective Cards → Gain VP if fulfilled, lose if not (played cards only)
  5. City Deliveries → VP from City Crests
     - Oregon City: 3 VP per icon revealed on Auxiliary Board
  6. Workers:
     - 5th/6th space: 4 VP each
     - Cleared space: 3 VP
  7. Job Market Token: 2 VP
  8. Collected Tiles:
     - Hazard: VP as printed
     - Outlaw: VP as printed
  9. Station Master Tasks:
     - 1 VP per Worker
     - 3 VP per 2 Objective Cards
     - 3 VP per 2 Hazard Tiles
     - 3 VP per (Green + Orange Outlaw) pair
     - 3 VP per 2 Certificates
     - 3 VP per 2 Train Stations with Disc
     - 2 VP per Building

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Cannot Pay Hand Fees?** Pay what you can; movement continues.
- **No Discs Left?** Remove 1 from any Train Station.
- **Engine Movement**: Skip over other Engines; Turnout counts as extra space.
- **Last Railroad Space**: Stop, upgrade if possible, gain $3, move Engine backward to any free space.
- **Branchlet Placement**: Must be accessible via rail connection; only one per Town Square.
- **Objective Tasks**: Each fulfilled task counts for only one Objective Card.
