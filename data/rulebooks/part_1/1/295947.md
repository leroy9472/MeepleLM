## Cascadia — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Cascadia is set in the Pacific Northwest, where players draft habitat tiles and wildlife tokens to build interconnected ecosystems. The goal is to score the most victory points by:  
- Maximizing wildlife scoring patterns based on randomly selected Wildlife Scoring Cards.  
- Creating large contiguous habitat corridors (Mountains, Forests, Prairies, Wetlands, Rivers).  
- Winning majority control of habitat types.  
- Saving Nature Tokens for end-game points.  
The game ends after each player completes 20 turns. The player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the player with more Nature Tokens wins; if still tied, players share victory.

2. **Components**  
- 85 Habitat Tiles (including 25 Keystone Tiles)  
- 5 Starter Habitat Tiles  
- 100 Wildlife Tokens (20 each of: Grizzly Bear, Roosevelt Elk, Chinook Salmon, Red-Tailed Hawk, Red Fox)  
- 21 Wildlife Scoring Cards (4 per animal + 1 Family/Intermediate card)  
- 25 Nature Tokens (Douglas Fir cones)  
- 1 Cloth Bag (for Wildlife Tokens)  
- 1 Scorepad  

3. **Setup**  
- **Habitat Tiles**:  
  - 2 players: Use 43 tiles (or remove 42 from 85)  
  - 3 players: Use 63 tiles (or remove 22)  
  - 4 players: Use 83 tiles (or remove 2)  
  Shuffle selected tiles face-down into one or more stacks.  
- Place all Wildlife Tokens in the cloth bag and shuffle.  
- Randomly draw 1 Wildlife Scoring Card for each of the 5 animal types. Place them face-up in the center.  
- Give each player 1 random Starter Habitat Tile (placed in front of them).  
- Reveal 4 Habitat Tiles face-up in a row in the center.  
- Draw 4 Wildlife Tokens from the bag and pair one with each revealed tile.  
- Place Nature Tokens within reach.  
- Determine first player (e.g., who most recently saw wildlife in real life, or random choice).

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
On each turn, in clockwise order:  

**Step 1: Refresh Check (Before Selection)**  
- **4 Matching Wildlife Tokens**: Automatically replace all 4.  
  - Set aside the 4 tokens.  
  - Draw 4 new tokens from the bag, pairing each with a revealed tile.  
  - Return set-aside tokens to the bag.  
  - Repeat if condition persists.  
- **3 Matching Wildlife Tokens**: Active player may choose to replace them once per turn.  
  - Set aside the 3 matching tokens.  
  - Draw 3 new tokens and pair with tiles.  
  - Return set-aside tokens to the bag.  
- **Spend Nature Token (Optional, Multiple Uses Allowed)**:  
  - Option A: Replace any number of Wildlife Tokens (follow replacement process).  
  - Option B: Take any 1 of the 4 revealed Habitat Tiles and any 1 of the 4 Wildlife Tokens (bypassing pairings).  
  - Nature Tokens spent are returned to supply.

**Step 2: Select a Tile-Token Pair**  
- If no Nature Token is spent to override, select one of the four existing tile-token pairs.  
- Take both the Habitat Tile and its paired Wildlife Token.

**Step 3: Place Tile and Token**  
- **Place Habitat Tile**:  
  - Must be placed edge-adjacent to at least one tile already in your environment (including Starter Tile).  
  - Cannot overlap or move existing tiles.  
- **Place Wildlife Token**:  
  - Must be placed on a Habitat Tile that:  
    a) Does not already have a token.  
    b) Displays the matching wildlife icon (tiles show 1–3 wildlife options).  
  - You may place the token on the tile just acquired or any other eligible tile in your environment.  
  - If you cannot or choose not to place the token, return it to the bag.  
- **Keystone Tile Bonus**:  
  - If the placed Wildlife Token is on a Keystone Tile (marked with single wildlife icon, arrow, and droplet), gain 1 Nature Token from the supply.

**Step 4: Refresh Display**  
- Replace the taken Habitat Tile with a new one from the face-down stack(s).  
- Replace the taken Wildlife Token by drawing one randomly from the bag.  
- Do not shift existing tiles/tokens; refill empty spots.  
- If no tiles remain to refill, the game ends after this turn.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Tile Placement**: Adjacency required; terrain matching not required but beneficial for scoring.  
- **Token Placement**: Flexible placement across your environment if tile supports it.  
- **Nature Tokens**: Earned by placing wildlife on Keystone Tiles. Spendable for powerful actions:  
  - Take any tile + any token combo.  
  - Replace any number of wildlife tokens.  
- **Overpopulation Rules**:  
  - 4 identical tokens → automatic replacement.  
  - 3 identical tokens → optional replacement (once per turn).  
- **Wildlife Scoring Cards**: 5 random cards (one per animal) dictate unique scoring patterns.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
The game ends when a player takes the last tile and no tile remains to refill the display. Each player has placed exactly 20 tiles. Score in four categories:

**1. Wildlife Scoring Cards**  
Scoring varies per card. Examples from "A" cards:  
- **Grizzly Bear**: Score per pair of bears not adjacent to other bears.  
- **Roosevelt Elk**: Score for each elk in a straight line (connected side-to-side).  
- **Chinook Salmon**: Score per continuous run (each salmon adjacent to ≤2 others), runs not adjacent to other runs.  
- **Red-Tailed Hawk**: Score for each hawk not adjacent to another hawk.  
- **Red Fox**: Score for each unique animal type adjacent to the fox (including another fox).  

**2. Habitat Tile Corridors**  
- For each habitat type (Mountains, Forests, Prairies, Wetlands, Rivers):  
  - Score 1 point per tile in your largest contiguous group.  
  - Tiles are contiguous if they share a full edge of the same habitat type.

**3. Habitat Tile Corridor Majorities**  
- **Solo**: 2 points per habitat type with a group of 7+ tiles.  
- **2 Players**:  
  - 2 points to player with largest group.  
  - If tied, both score 1 point.  
  - No second-place points.  
- **3–4 Players**:  
  - 3 points to player with largest group.  
  - 1 point to player with second-largest group (if not tied).  
  - If 2 players tie for largest: both score 2 points; no second-place points.  
  - If 3–4 players tie for largest: each scores 1 point; no second-place points.  
  - Ties for second place: 0 points.

**4. Nature Tokens**  
- 1 point per unused Nature Token.

**Final Scoring & Tiebreaker**  
- Total all points.  
- If tied, player with more Nature Tokens wins.  
- If still tied, players share victory.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can I place a token on the tile I just placed?** Yes, if it supports that wildlife.  
- **What if no tile in my environment can support the wildlife?** Discard the token to the bag.  
- **Can I spend multiple Nature Tokens in one turn?** Yes. But only one can be used to take any tile + any token. Others can be used to replace wildlife tokens.  
- **When do overpopulation checks happen?** Before selecting a tile-token pair.  
- **Can I skip replacing 3 matching tokens?** Yes, it’s optional.  
- **Do I get a Nature Token if I place wildlife on a Keystone Tile via delayed placement?** Yes, as long as the tile is a Keystone and the wildlife matches.  
- **Can I use a Nature Token to take a discarded token?** No, only tokens currently in the display.  
- **What happens if the bag runs out of wildlife tokens?** The bag is the only source; tokens are returned after discards and replacements, so this should not occur.
