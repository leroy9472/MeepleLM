## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Pandemic Legacy: Season 2 is a cooperative, campaign-based board game set 70 years after a global pandemic has devastated civilization. Players are members of a surviving team working to rebuild society by reconnecting isolated cities, managing dwindling resources, and uncovering hidden knowledge. The overarching goal is to complete monthly objectives and ultimately deliver a cure sample to end the campaign. Over the course of the game, player choices permanently alter the game world through stickers, destroyed cards, and revealed legacy content. Success or failure impacts the final story outcome and scoring.

- Prepare Player Deck: 36 City cards, 8 Produce Supplies, 4 Rationed Events, 5 Epidemics.  
- Prepare Infection Deck: 27 Infection cards.  
- Shuffle and place 9 Infection cards (3 cubes in 3 cities; 3 Hollow Men in 3 cities).  
- Place 36 Supply Cubes in stockpile; 8 Plague Cubes nearby.  
- Set infection and incident markers to minimum.  
- Each player selects a character, places pawn in home city, and receives starting hand.  
- Shuffle Legacy Deck and follow current month’s instructions (e.g., STOP cards, missions).  
- Open required Dossier Doors per monthly directives.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn:  
1. Perform up to 4 actions (e.g., move, treat disease, build supply center, share knowledge).  
2. Draw 2 Player Cards (reshuffle discard if needed; Epidemic cards trigger outbreak steps).  
3. Draw infection cards per current infection rate:  
   - Place Plague cubes (if no supply cube present).  
   - Place Hollow Men figures (draw until city card after Hollow Men card).  
   - Intensify: reshuffle discard pile and place on top of deck.  
After each turn, check for game end conditions.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Legacy Progression**: Each month reveals new content via Legacy Deck (e.g., missions, rules, character abilities).  
- **Population Tracking**: Cities have population levels (0–8); supply centers increase population.  
- **Permanent Structures**: Build Supply Centers (discard 5 matching city cards), Shelters (discard 1 matching card), Satellite Towers (spend 2 supply cubes).  
- **Hollow Men**: Enemy units that spread Plague; can be moved via Broadcast Misinformation.  
- **Exposures**: Triggered by starting turn in infected or infested cities; advance exposure track on character card (may cause scars or death).  
- **Rule Changes**: New rules introduced monthly (labeled A–W); applied permanently.  
- **Search**: Reveal hidden content on cards by scratching off silver areas.  
- **Supply Lines & Sea Lanes**: Established using markers; enable special movement.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends in December or upon completing final objective (Deliver the Sample).  
- Final scoring is determined by card 12-08a/b ("The Final Reckoning").  
- Victory score depends on whether the sample was delivered and total population saved.  
- Multiple endings exist (e.g., delivered/not delivered) with narrative consequences.  
- Final score is recorded on Game Calendar.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Destroyed Components**: Do not permanently destroy cards; store in "Destroyed" bag for replay.  
- **Stickers**: Use removable labels or Post-its to preserve components for replay.  
- **Population Markers**: Use Bingo chips or cardboard squares to avoid permanent board damage.  
- **Legacy Deck Order**: Must be maintained (00-01 to 12-13); includes Events, Epidemics, Hollow Men Gather.  
- **Rulebook Changes**: Apply new rules beside original text; cover old rule with Post-it.  
- **Character Death**: If skull is revealed, character is retired but may still play (no further upgrades).  
- **Replay Reset**: Follow reset instructions to restore packages, doors, decks, and stickers for future campaigns.
