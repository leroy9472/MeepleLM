# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In "Barci #1 - Need No Education", Mechs seek to enter the School without formal education. The objective is to dig underground through magma, traverse it, and resurface next to the Teacher (Boss) outside the school. Victory is achieved when all Mechs are inside the School building. The Teacher (Boss) stands guard outside and cannot enter the school.

## 2. Components
- Map Tiles #1–#5 with dual sides (meadow and magma)
- Mech miniatures
- Minion figures
- Boss (Teacher) figure
- Command Cards
- Damage Cards
- Gear Tracker with Doom Tracker
- Minion Kill Tracker
- Lava Wall marker
- Rune Shields and Rune Coins
- Repair Pads
- Crystal Compass and Rune Die

## 3. Setup
- Place Map Tiles as per mission layout: Tile #1 (lower left), Tile #5 (upper right).
- Place Boss (Teacher) outside the school entrance.
- Mechs start on designated starting positions (implied near Tile #1).
- Lava Wall starts to the right of the starting tile.
- Minions spawn initially on the two lower meadow tiles (TBD exact positions).

## 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Player Phase**:
   - Draft Command Cards (Double Draft in first round).
   - Program or scrap cards.
   - Execute Command Lines in order.
2. **Minion Phase**:
   - Minions move toward Mechs.
   - New minions spawn on designated tiles.
   - Minions attack adjacent Mechs.
3. **Danger Phase**:
   - Move Lava Wall one step left.
   - If Lava Wall reaches next tile: Game Over.
   - Trigger Escalation Levels after Digging Cascades.
4. **Digging Action (Special)**:
   - Mandatory when all Mechs are on a Dig tile.
   - Scrap a command card → trigger Digging Cascade.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Digging
- **Allowed only on**:
  - Tile #1 (Meadow → Magma): DIG DOWN
  - Tile #5 (Magma → Meadow): DIG UP
- **Requirements**:
  - All Mechs must be on the Dig tile.
  - Last Mech to enter must scrap one unused command card.
  - If all Mechs are present, action is immediate and mandatory, ending the turn.

### Digging Cascade
1. Remove all Minions from the board (place on tracker).
2. Flip the current tile:
   - **DIG DOWN (Tile #1)**: Flip vertically so magma side faces down; 2 yellow rake fields and repair field point downward. Place Mechs in any direction on the 2 lower rows.
   - **DIG UP (Tile #5)**: Flip vertically so oil field points right; repair field left. Place Mechs on the 4 center fields, any direction.
3. Trigger next Escalation Level immediately.
4. Proceed to Minion Phase.

### Escalation Levels
- **Level 1 (after first Dig: DIG DOWN)**:
  - Minions can move and spawn on Magma tiles.
- **Level 2 (after second Dig: DIG UP)**:
  - Minions can move and spawn on all tiles.
  - Boss activates: gains Rune Shields, 6 lives, standard movement/attack rules apply.

### Boss Rules
- Cannot enter the School.
- Activated at Escalation Level 2.
- Has 6 lives.
- If Boss defeats the GG101 Mech: Game Over.
- Rune Shields active; disable by stepping on matching Rune Spaces.

### Movement & Hazards
- Mechs cannot move directly between meadow and magma tiles — must Dig.
- Lava Wall moves left each round; blocks movement; touching it = damage.
- Oil Slicks cause sliding until obstacle is hit.
- Minions do not push each other.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: All Mechs are inside the School building.
- **Loss Conditions**:
  - Lava Wall reaches the next tile (leftward progression).
  - Boss defeats GG101 Mech.
  - All Mechs are destroyed (not explicitly defined but implied via damage).

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can Mechs enter school before finishing digging?**  
  No — must complete Dig Up via Tile #5 to access the meadow next to Boss, then proceed to school.
- **What happens if not all Mechs are on the Dig tile?**  
  Digging cannot be initiated.
- **Who scraps the card during Dig?**  
  The last Mech to enter the Dig tile scrapes one unused command card. If that was their last, the next Mech to the left does it.
- **Does Digging count as a full turn?**  
  Yes — Digging ends the turn immediately for all Mechs.
- **Is the Boss affected by Oil?**  
  No — Boss does not slide on Oil (per general rules).
- **Can you win by defeating the Boss?**  
  No — defeating the Boss (reducing to 0 lives) is not sufficient. All Mechs must still enter the School.
