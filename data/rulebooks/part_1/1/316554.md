## DUNE: IMPERIUM — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are a Leader of one of the Great Houses vying for control of the spice melange on the desert planet Arrakis. Your goal is to gain Victory Points (VPs) through political influence, military strength, and strategic deck-building. The game ends when any player reaches 10 or more VPs or the Conflict Deck is empty. The player with the most VPs wins.

### 2. Components

- Reserve cards: Arrakis Liaison, The Spice Must Flow, Foldspace

   - Bottom: 4 shuffled Conflict III cards  
   - Middle: 5 shuffled Conflict II cards  
   - Top: 1 shuffled Conflict I card  
3. Shuffle the Imperium Deck and deal 5 cards face-up (Imperium Row).  
4. Place Reserve stacks: Arrakis Liaison, The Spice Must Flow, Foldspace.  
5. Shuffle the Intrigue Deck and place it face down.  
6. Each player:  
   - Chooses a Leader and starting deck (10 cards)  
   - Places 2 Agents on Leader, 3rd Agent (Swordmaster) beside board  
   - Places 1 disc on Score track (0, or 1 in 4-player)  
   - Places Combat marker on 0 of Combat track  
   - Places 1 cube on bottom of each Influence track  
   - Places 3 troops in garrison  
   - Takes 1 Water

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has 5 phases:  
1. **Round Start**: Reveal top Conflict card. Each player draws 5 cards.  
2. **Player Turns**: Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, take either:  
   - **Agent Turn**: Play 1 card, send 1 Agent to a matching board space, pay costs, gain space and card effects.  
   - **Reveal Turn**: Reveal all remaining cards, resolve Reveal effects, acquire cards using Persuasion, set Combat strength, then clean up.  
3. **Combat**: Players with troops in Conflict play Combat Intrigue cards (optional), then resolve rewards based on strength.  
4. **Makers**: Add 1 Spice to each unoccupied Maker space (The Great Flat, Hagga Basin, Imperial Basin).  
5. **Recall**:  
   - If any player has ≥10 VPs or Conflict Deck is empty → Endgame.  
   - Else: Return Agents and Mentat, pass First Player marker, begin new round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Agents**: Start with 2; gain 3rd via Swordmaster space (8 Solari).  
- **Cards**: Each has Agent box (Agent turn) and Reveal box (Reveal turn). Play one box per card per game.  
- **Acquire**: When acquiring a card, gain its Acquire effect once. Cards go to discard pile unless specified.  
- **Persuasion**: Gained from Reveal boxes. Used during Reveal turn to buy cards from Imperium Row or Reserve.  
- **Combat**:  
  - Strength = (2 × Troops in Conflict) + (1 × Swords revealed)  
  - Must have ≥1 troop in Conflict to have strength.  
  - Dreadnoughts count as 3 strength (with Rise of Ix).  
- **Control**: Win Control of Arrakeen, Carthag, or Imperial Basin via Conflict rewards. Gain bonus (1 Solari or 1 Spice) whenever any player sends an Agent there.  
- **Factions**:  
  - Gain 1 Influence per Agent sent to Faction space.  
  - At 2 Influence: gain 1 VP. Lose it if Influence drops below 2.  
  - At 4 Influence: gain permanent bonus.  
  - First to 4 Influence gains Alliance token and 1 VP. If overtaken, token and VP transfer.  
- **Intrigue Cards**:  
  - Plot: Play during Agent or Reveal turn.  
  - Combat: Play during Combat phase.  
  - Endgame: Play at game end.  
- **Graft**: Cards with Graft must be played with one other card. Both effects apply.  
- **Fremen Bond**: Activate if another Fremen card is in play.  
- **Infiltration**: Play cards with Infiltration icon to send Agent to occupied space.  
- **Dreadnoughts** (Rise of Ix): Gain from card or Tech tile. Deployable from garrison during Combat.  
- **Freighter & Shipping Track** (Rise of Ix): Advance Freighter or recall to gain rewards.  
- **Research & Tleilaxu Tracks** (Immortality):  
  - Research: Move token right for bonuses. At Genetic Marker I: Tleilaxu cards go to top of deck. At II: Research draws a card instead.  
  - Tleilaxu: Advance for rewards. Spend Specimens (from supply) to buy Tleilaxu Row cards.
