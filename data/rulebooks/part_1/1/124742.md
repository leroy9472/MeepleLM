- **Credits**: Currency for playing cards, triggering abilities, or breaking traces.  
- **Installing Cards**:  
  - Corp: Install Agendas, Assets, Upgrades, or Ice from HQ. Cards installed facedown (unrezzed) unless paid to rez.  
    - Ice install cost = number of ice already protecting that server.  
    - Only 1 Agenda or Asset per remote server. Unlimited Upgrades.  
  - Runner: Install Programs, Hardware, or Resources from Grip. Always faceup.  
    - Programs use Memory Units (MU). Runner starts with 4 MU.  
    - If MU exceeded, trash programs until within limit.  
- **Advancing Cards**:  
  - Corp spends 1 click + 1 credit to place an advancement token on a card.  
  - Agendas may be advanced even while unrezzed.

  - **Phases of a Run**:  
    1. **Initiation**: Declare server. Gain 1 temporary credit per Corp Bad Publicity.  
    2. **Confrontation**: Approach ice one at a time (outermost first).  
       - May jack out (except at first ice).  
       - Corp may rez approached ice or non-ice cards.  
       - If rezzed, Runner encounters ice.  
    3. **Encounter Ice**:  
       - Runner uses Icebreakers to break subroutines.  
       - Icebreaker strength must ≥ ice strength.  
       - Subtypes: Sentry, Barrier, Code Gate, Trap — must match for breaking.  
       - Unbroken subroutines resolve in order. “End the Run” subroutine ends run immediately.  
    4. **Access Phase**:  
       - After passing all ice, Runner may jack out.  
       - Corp may rez remaining cards.  
       - Access cards based on server:  
         - **R&D**: Top card (secret). May steal agenda or trash card if cost paid.  
         - **HQ**: 1 random card. May steal agenda or trash.

         - **Remote Server**: All cards in server. Steal agendas, trash cards if cost paid.  
       - All unaccessed/untrashed cards return to original state.  
- **Traces**:  
  - Triggered by card effect.  
  - Corp sets trace strength by spending credits.  
  - Runner sets link strength (from cards/identity) and may spend credits.  
  - If trace > link: trace successful (resolve “if successful” effects).  
  - If link ≥ trace: trace unsuccessful.

  - **Meat/Net Damage**: Trash 1 random card from Grip per point.  
  - **Brain Damage**: Trash 1 random card + reduce max hand size by 1 (tracked with brain token).  
  - If Runner must take damage with 0 cards in Grip, or max hand size < 0 at end of turn → flatlined (Corp wins).
