### 1. Lore & Objective
You are Spirits of nature defending your island from colonizing Invaders who harm the land and native Dahan people. The Invaders disrupt the natural balance, spreading Blight as they expand. The Spirits must grow in power and drive the Invaders off before the Island becomes irreversibly Blighted.

**Victory**: Achieve the current Terror Level's win condition:
- **Terror Level 1**: Remove all Invaders from the Island.
- **Terror Level 2**: Remove all Towns and Cities from the Island.
- **Terror Level 3**: Remove all Cities from the Island.
- **Immediate Victory**: Earn the 9th Fear Card.

**Defeat**: The game ends in defeat if:
- The Blight Card runs out of Blight while on its "Blighted Island" side.
- Any Spirit has no Presence left on the Island.
- The Invader Deck is empty when an Explore action requires a card.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn follows a strict sequence. Players act simultaneously within each phase.

1. **Spirit Phase**
2. **Fast Power Phase**
3. **Invader Phase**
4. **Slow Power Phase**
5. **Time Passes**

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Spirit Phase:**
- **Growth**: Choose one Growth option (e.g., add Presence, gain Energy, gain a Power Card, reclaim cards).
- **Gain Energy**: Gain Energy equal to the highest revealed number on your Energy Presence Track.
- **Play and Pay for Power Cards**: Play up to the number of cards allowed by your Card Plays track. Pay Energy cost immediately. Gain Elements from played cards.

**Fast Power Phase:**
- Resolve effects of Fast Powers (red bird icon) from Power Cards and Innate Powers. Resolution order is player's choice.

**Invader Phase:**
- **Blighted Island Effect**: If the Blight Card is on its "Blighted Island" side, follow its instructions.
- **Event**: Resolve the top Event Card (skip on the first turn).
- **Earned Fear**: Resolve all earned Fear Cards, using the effect for the current Terror Level. Discard after.
- **Invader Actions**:
  - **Ravage**: Invaders in lands of the Ravage card's type deal Damage (Explorer:1, Town:2, City:3) to the land and Dahan. If land takes 2+ Damage, add 1 Blight. Surviving Dahan fight back (2 Damage each).
  - **Build**: In lands of the Build card's type with Invaders, add a Town. If Towns > Cities, add a City instead.
  - **Explore**: Reveal top Invader Card. Add an Explorer to every land of the shown type that has a Town/City, is adjacent to one, or is Coastal.
- **Advance Invader Cards**: Move Ravage card to discard, Build card to Ravage space, Explore card to Build space.

**Slow Power Phase:**
- Resolve effects of Slow Powers (blue turtle icon) from Power Cards and Innate Powers. Resolution order is player's choice.

**Time Passes:**
- Discard all played Power Cards to personal discard piles.
- Heal all damaged pieces (Dahan, Invaders).
- Remove all temporary effects (Defend, tokens).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Scoring (Optional):**
- **Victory**: 5 x Difficulty + 10 bonus + 2 per Invader Card remaining in the deck.
- **Defeat**: 2 x Difficulty + 1 per Invader Card not in the deck.
- **Both**: +1 per 10 living Dahan, -1 per 10 Blight on the Island.

**End Game Conditions:**
- **Win**: Meet the current Terror Level's condition or earn the 9th Fear Card.
- **Lose**: Run out of Blight on the "Blighted Island" side, lose all Presence, or run out of Invader Cards.
- **Sacrifice Victory**: If a single effect causes both win and loss conditions, the players win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Targeting**: Range is measured from your Presence unless specified. "Your Land" means a land with your Presence.
- **Damage Allocation**: Players choose how to allocate Damage from Spirit Powers. Invader Damage to Dahan must destroy Dahan as efficiently as possible.
- **Power Effects**: You may skip a Power's text effects (but not Elements). If you resolve it, do as much as you can.
- **Cascading Blight**: Adding Blight to a Blighted land causes 1 additional Blight to be added to one adjacent land. This can cascade further.
- **Presence and Sacred Sites**: A Sacred Site is a land with 2+ of your Presence. Destroyed Presence is removed from play.
- **Fear Generation**: Destroying a Town generates 1 Fear; destroying a City generates 2 Fear. Removing or Replacing does not generate Fear.
- **Adversaries/Scenarios**: These add difficulty and modify rules. Apply their effects during setup and gameplay as specified.
