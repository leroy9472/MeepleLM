### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 5 Phases (A–E), each with 5 Rounds.

#### Phase Start  
- Remove all hex tiles from depots (except black depot tiles stay).  
- Randomly refill depots:  
  - 2 players: only depots 2 and 3  
  - 3 players: depots 2, 3, and one special depot with rotating Castle/Mine  
  - 4 players: all depots 1–6  
- Reveal 5 Goods Tiles for current phase (A–E) and place one on each round space (1–5).

#### Round Sequence  
1. **Roll Dice**:  
   - First Player rolls white die.  
   - All players roll their 2 dice simultaneously.  
2. **Place Goods Tile**:  
   - First Player places the top Goods Tile from current phase’s display onto the depot matching the white die roll.  
3. **Player Turns**:  
   - Players take turns in turn order (top to bottom on turn order track).  
   - On your turn:  
     - Perform 2 actions (1 per die).  
     - Optionally, once per turn, buy 1 tile from black depot for 2 Silverlings.  
     - Worker Tiles may be used at any time to adjust a die result by ±1 (e.g., 1 ↔ 6). Multiple Workers may be used on one die.  
4. **End of Round**:  
   - Proceed to next round until 5 rounds completed.  
5. **End of Phase**:  
   - Each player gains 1 Silverling per Mine in their estate.  
   - If player has Knowledge Tile #2: gain 1 Worker Tile per Mine.  
   - Proceed to next phase.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions (1 per die)  
Choose two of the following:

1. **Take a Hex Tile from Depot**  
   - Use die result to take 1 tile from matching-numbered depot.  
   - Place in storage (max 3 tiles). If full, discard 1 existing tile before taking new one.  
   - Cannot discard the newly taken tile.

2. **Add a Hex Tile to Estate**  
   - Move 1 tile from storage to estate.  
   - Must match:  
     - Die number (space number)  
     - Tile color (space color)  
     - Must be adjacent to an existing tile (except first tile, placed next to starting Castle).  
   - Trigger tile’s immediate effect.  
   - **Restriction**: No two identical building types in same region (city).

3. **Sell Goods**  
   - Use die to sell all goods of matching type from storage.  
   - Gain:  
     - 2/3/4 VP per good (2/3/4 players)  
     - 1 Silverling (regardless of quantity sold)  
   - Place sold goods face-down in sold goods area.

4. **Take Worker Tiles**  
   - Take 2 Worker Tiles from supply.  
   - Usable with any die result.

#### Optional Action: Buy from Black Depot  
- Once per turn, spend 2 Silverlings to take any tile from black depot.  
- Place in storage (subject to storage limits).  
- Can be done before, between, or after actions.

  - Score 1 VP per animal on tile.  
  - If matching animal type already in same pasture, re-score all prior matching animals (1 VP each).

6. May buy from any depot (not just black) once per turn.  
7. Gain +1 VP per animal tile when scoring (including prior tiles).  
8. Each Worker Tile adjusts die by ±2 (instead of ±1).

#### Scoring During Game  
- **Complete a Region**:  
  - Score VP based on size (1–8 hexes → 1–36 VP, per player board table).  
  - Score VP based on phase: A=10, B=8, C=6, D=4, E=2.  
  - Add both values.  
- **Complete a Color**:  
  - First player to fill all spaces of one color gets large Bonus Tile (5/6/7 VP).  
  - Second player gets small Bonus Tile (2/3/4 VP).  
  - Only 2 players can claim per color.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after Phase E. Final scoring:  
- 1 VP per unsold goods tile  
- 1 VP per Silverling  
- 1 VP per 2 Worker Tiles (round down)  
- All Knowledge Tile end-game bonuses (15–26)  
- All Bonus Tiles claimed  
- All completed regions and colors already scored during game.

**Winner**: Most VP.  
**Tiebreaker**:  
1. Fewer empty estate spaces  
2. Later in turn order

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Storage Full?** You may discard an existing tile to make space before taking a new one. Cannot discard the new tile.  
- **Turn Order Ties**: Multiple players on same space — topmost marker goes first.  
- **Worker Tile Use**: Can be used to adjust any die at any time (before or during action). Returned to supply after use.  
- **City Hall Action**: Full tile placement rules apply (adjacency, color, number), but die is not required.  
- **Goats Tile**: Special Animal tile that counts as any animal type. When scored, gives +2 VP if other animals added later. Counts as unique type for Knowledge #24.  
- **Park Tile**: Functions as any building during game; counts as one building type at endgame.  
- **Cloister**: Helps complete regions; increases region size by 1 for scoring (max size 8).
