The objective varies by scenario but typically involves defeating enemies, looting treasures, and achieving specific goals. Campaign progression unlocks new scenarios, buildings, and character classes.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Card Selection**: Characters secretly choose two ability cards; one determines initiative.
2. **Ordering of Initiative**: Reveal initiative values and arrange all figures (characters, monsters, summons) in turn order.
3. **Character and Monster Turns**: Each figure takes a turn in initiative order:
   - Characters perform two actions (one from each card).
   - Monsters perform one action based on their drawn ability card.
4. **End of Round**: 
   - Trigger end-of-round effects.
   - Shuffle decks with shuffle icons.
   - Move infused elements left (strong → waning → inert).
   - Perform short rests (optional).
   - Round bonuses expire.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Conditions**: Positive (e.g., Regenerate, Ward, Invisible, Strengthen, Bless) and Negative (e.g., Wound, Brittle, Bane, Poison, Immobilize, Disarm, Impair, Stun, Muddle, Curse). Conditions have specific durations and removal conditions.
- **Attack Resolution**:
  1. Apply attack bonuses/penalties.
  2. Draw attack modifier card (advantage/disadvantage modifies this).
  3. Apply target’s shield.
  4. Apply Ward/Brittle (they cancel each other).
- **Movement**: Normal movement costs 1 point per hex. Difficult terrain costs 2. Jump and Flying ignore most terrain.
- **Healing**: "Heal X" increases current HP. Regenerate provides "Heal 1, self" at the start of each turn.
- **Resting**:
  - **Short Rest**: End of round; lose 1 random card from discard, draw rest. Can lose 1 HP to redraw.
  - **Long Rest**: Card selection phase; lose 1 chosen card, draw rest; optionally heal 2 and recover spent items.
- **Monster AI**: Monsters act based on ability cards. They find focus (closest enemy via shortest path), move to attack, and follow automated behavior.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Ending a Scenario**: Play until the current round ends after the completion/loss condition is triggered.
- **Lost Scenario**:
  - All characters exhausted or loss condition met.
  - Choose: Return to Frosthaven (gain resources, gold, XP, Outpost Phase) or Replay (keep XP/gold, no resources, no Outpost Phase).
- **Completed Scenario**:
  - Gain loot resources.
  - Earn checkmarks for achieved battle goals (3 = 1 perk mark).
  - Gain perk marks for new masteries.
  - Read conclusion and gain rewards.
  - Gain inspiration (4 - number of characters).
  - Mark scenario as completed on map.
  - Return to Frosthaven (or play linked scenario).
- **Experience**: Tracked on blue dial. Gained from ability cards with experience icons, battle goals, and scenario completion.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Ties in Initiative**: Break with second card’s initiative; if still tied, party decides.
- **Monster Focus**: If no valid attack hex, monster doesn’t move or attack but performs other abilities.
- **Summons**: Act before summoner in initiative; use summoner’s attack modifier deck.
- **Kill Credit**: Given to figure causing damage (attack, retaliate, suffer damage). Forced movement into traps grants credit.
- **Exhaustion**: At 0 HP or <2 cards in hand/discards. Figure is removed; all cards go to lost pile.
- **Bless/Curse**: Add cards to deck. Bless = +2, Curse = -2. Cards return to supply after use.
