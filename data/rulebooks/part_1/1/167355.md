### 3. Setup
1. Place the board and shuffle room tiles (2s first, then 1s), placing one face down on each slot.
2. Place one exploration token face down on each room.
3. Place coordinates card face down near cockpit; set destination marker to B.
4. Set time marker to space 15 (green).
5. Place escape pods (2 for 1–2 players, 3 for 3–4, 4 for 5) alternating between sections A and B, locked side up.
6. Shuffle and place engine tokens face down on engine spaces (two per engine, one on top).
7. Place intruder board with 5 egg tokens and 3 random weakness cards.
8. Place intruder tokens in bag: 1 blank, 4 larva, 1 creeper, 3 adults, 1 queen, +1 adult per player.
9. Shuffle and place decks: item (3 colors), crafted items, event, intruder attack, contamination, serious wound.
10. Give each player a help card (numbered for player count), matching inventory holder, one personal and one corporate objective card (secret), and a character via draft.
11. Players take character board, miniature (placed in Hibernatorium), action deck, starting item, and quest items.
12. Place blue character corpse token in Hibernatorium. First player takes the starting player token.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
**Player Phase:**
1. Draw up to 5 action cards.
2. Pass first player token (except first turn).
3. Players take turns performing 2 actions each (or 1 and pass, or pass). Actions include movement, combat, room use, crafting, etc. Play continues clockwise until all pass.

**Event Phase:**
1. Move time track and self-destruct track (if active) right one space.
2. Intruder Attack: each intruder in combat attacks.
3. Fire Damage: each intruder in a room with fire takes 1 injury.
4. Resolve Event Card: intruders move (non-combat), then resolve card effect.
5. Intruder Bag Development: draw token and resolve effect.

Repeat phases until game end condition is met.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Actions**: Most cost discarding 1 or 2 action cards. Cannot use contamination cards to pay.
- **Movement**: Move to adjacent room. Closed doors block movement. Entering unexplored room reveals tile and exploration token.
- **Noise Rolls**: When entering empty room, roll noise die. 1–4: place noise marker in numbered corridor. DANGER: move nearby intruders or place noise markers. SILENCE: nothing. Slime converts SILENCE to DANGER.
- **Encounter**: Triggered when noise marker placement fails or via card. Discard corridor noise markers, draw intruder token. If hand size < token number, surprise attack.
- **Combat**: In same room as intruder = in combat. Can Shoot (discard ammo, roll combat die) or Melee (draw contamination card, roll die). Miss on melee = serious wound.
- **Injury & Death**: 3 light wounds = 1 serious wound. 4 serious wounds = death. 3 serious wounds + any wound = death. Can dress serious wound (flip card) to ignore effect.
- **Contamination**: Cards drawn from deck. Scanning reveals "INFECTED". If infected, place larva. Second larva = death (place corpse and creeper).
- **Room Actions**: Require 2 action cards and room must be functional (no malfunction cog). Cannot use in combat.
  - *Airlock Control*: Pick yellow room, close all doors, place airlock token. If doors opened, fails.
  - *Armory*: Add 2 ammo to one energy weapon.
  - *Cabins*: Start turn here without intruders → draw extra card.
  - *Canteen*: Remove 1 light wound. May scan hand’s contamination cards: remove non-infected. If any infected, place larva; if larva already, die.
  - *Cockpit*: Check coordinates or change destination (not if hibernating).
  - *Command Centre*: Open/close doors in corridors of one chosen room.
  - *Comms Room*: Send signal (mark on player board).
  - *Emergency Room*: Dress serious wound, remove dressed wound, or heal 1 light wound.
  - *Engine Control*: Secretly check status of all three engines.
  - *Engine Room*: Check engine status or repair/break using repair/tool card.
  - *Escape Pods*: Enter via working evacuation section. Hold 2 people. Can wait (auto pass), launch (survive), or exit.
  - *Evacuation Section*: Noise roll to enter pod. Fail if intruder appears.
  - *Fire Control*: Remove fire from one room. Intruders inside run away (draw event for direction).
  - *Hibernatorium*: If time track on blue, noise roll to hibernate (remove from game).
  - *Generator*: Start/stop self-destruct (cannot start if hibernating).
  - *Hatch Control*: Lock/unlock one escape pod.
  - *Laboratory*: Analyze corpse, carcass, or egg to reveal weakness.
  - *Monitoring Room*: Secretly look at one unexplored room and token.
  - *Nest*: Take one egg (noise roll). Destroy eggs via attack. Last egg gone = nest destroyed.
  - *Shower Room*: Remove slime. May scan hand’s contamination cards (same risk as Canteen).
  - *Slime Room*: Enter → get slime marker.
  - *Storage*: Search: draw 2 cards from one color deck, keep one.
  - *Surgery*: Scan all contamination cards in hand, deck, discard; remove infected. Remove larva. Then take 1 light wound, auto pass, shuffle action deck.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Game ends when:**
- Time track reaches red space: non-hibernating characters die.
- Self-destruct reaches red or 9th fire/malfunction placed: ship explodes, all die.
- Last non-hibernating character dies, hibernates, or escapes: move time or self-destruct to red and resolve.

**Victory Check (if at least one survived):**
1. **Engines Check**: Reveal top engine token of each engine. 2+ damaged → ship explodes, all hibernating die.
2. **Coordinates Check**: Reveal coordinates. If not Earth (or Mars for specific objective), hibernating characters die.
3. **Contamination Check**: Each survivor scans all contamination cards. If any infected or has larva, shuffle all cards and draw 4. If any contamination card drawn, character dies.
4. **Objective Check**: Reveal objectives. Player wins if objective fulfilled and survived.
