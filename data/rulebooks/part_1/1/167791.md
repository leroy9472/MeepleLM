## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Terraforming Mars*, players take on the role of powerful corporations competing to transform Mars into a habitable planet. The objective is to contribute the most to raising the planet’s global parameters—Temperature, Oxygen Level, and Oceans—to their maximum levels. Once all three are complete, the game ends, and the player with the highest Victory Points (VP) wins. Victory Points are earned through Terraforming Rating (TR), claimed Milestones, funded Awards, tile placement, and card effects.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game round is called a **Generation**, consisting of 5 phases:

#### PHASE 1 – Player Order (Skip Generation 1)  
- Pass First Player token clockwise.  
- Advance Generation marker by 1.

#### PHASE 2 – Research (Skip Generation 1)  
- Each player draws 4 Project cards.  
- May purchase any number at 3 M€ each.  
- Discard unkept cards face down.  
- No hand limit.  
- *Draft Variant:* In even/odd generations, pass cards clockwise/anticlockwise until each has 4, then buy.

#### PHASE 3 – Actions  
- Starting with First Player, each player takes 1 or 2 actions or passes.  
- Players may act multiple times until they pass.  
- When all pass, phase ends.  

**Available Actions:**  
1. **Play a card** – Pay cost, meet requirements, resolve effects.  
2. **Use a Standard Project:**  
   - Sell Patent: Discard any cards, gain 1 M€ each.  
   - Power Plant: Pay 11 M€ → +1 Energy production.  
   - Asteroid: Pay 14 M€ → +1 Temperature, +1 TR.  
   - Aquifer: Pay 18 M€ → place Ocean tile, +1 TR.  
   - Greenery: Pay 23 M€ → place Greenery, +1 Oxygen, +1 TR.  
   - City: Pay 25 M€ → place City, +1 M€ production.  
3. **Claim a Milestone** – Pay 8 M€, meet requirement, place cube. Max 3 per game.  
4. **Fund an Award** – Pay escalating cost (8 → 14 → 20 M€), place cube. Max 3 per game.  
5. **Use Blue Card Action** – Pay cost, resolve effect, mark as used. Once per generation.  
6. **Convert 8 Plants** → place Greenery, +1 Oxygen, +1 TR.  
7. **Convert 8 Heat** → +1 Temperature, +1 TR.  

#### PHASE 4 – Production  
- Move all Energy cubes to Heat.  
- Gain resources based on production levels.  
- Gain M€ = TR + M€ production (can be negative, down to -5).  
- Remove markers from used Blue cards.

#### PHASE 5 – Solar Phase
