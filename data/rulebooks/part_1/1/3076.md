## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Puerto Rico*, players are Spanish noblemen establishing plantations and constructing buildings on the island colony of Puerto Rico during the 1500s. The goal is to gain the most victory points (VPs) through two main paths:  
- **Shipping goods** to Europe via the Captain phase.  
- **Building structures** on your island, especially valuable large violet buildings.

The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most doubloons and goods combined wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Starting Resources**:  
   - Each player receives (N−1) doubloons (N = number of players).  
   - Starting player (Governor) is chosen randomly.

2. **Starting Plantations**:  
   - 3 players: 1st and 2nd place Indigo; 3rd places Corn  
   - 4 players: 1st and 2nd place Indigo; 3rd and 4th place Corn  
   - 5 players: 1st, 2nd, 3rd place Indigo; 4th and 5th place Corn  

3. **Face-up Plantations**:  
   - Shuffle all plantation tiles (excluding quarries).  
   - Create 5 face-down stacks. Reveal (N+1) tiles face-up.

4. **Quarries**:  
   - Place 8 quarry tiles in a separate face-up pile.

5. **Ships**:  
   - Use the three ships with capacities (N+1), (N+2), (N+3).  
   - Example: 4-player game uses 5-, 6-, and 7-space ships.

6. **Other Setup**:  
   - Place all buildings on the main board.  
   - Place doubloons in the bank.  
   - Set up Trading House, Colonist Ship, and role cards.  
   - Place N colonists on the Colonist Ship.  
   - Add VP chips: 75 (3P), 100 (4P), 122 (5P).  
   - Add colonists: 55 (3P), 75 (4P), 95 (5P).

7. **Optional Balance Rules (Recommended)**:  
   - Swap Factory (cost 8) and University (cost 7).  
   - Players starting with Corn receive 1 fewer doubloon.

8. **Expansions**:  
   - **Exp. II – Nobles**: Add 20 nobles. One noble replaces a colonist on the ship each Mayor phase.  
   - **Exp. IV – Festival**: Randomly select 1 plantation, 3 goods, and 1 column 3 building; lock them until goals are met.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in two phases:

#### A. Action Phase (Player Turns)  
1. Starting with the Governor, each player selects one **unused role card**.  
2. The player who chose the role performs the **action** and gains the **privilege** (bonus).  
3. All other players, in clockwise order, may perform the **action** (but not the privilege).  
4. Repeat until all players have chosen a role.

#### B. End of Round  
1. Place **1 doubloon** on each of the 3 unselected roles.  
2. Return all role cards to the center.  
3. Pass the **Governor card** clockwise.  
4. Begin the next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Roles & Privileges  
Each role has an **action** (available to all) and a **privilege** (only for the chooser):

| Role | Action | Privilege |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Settler** | Take 1 face-up plantation or quarry (if eligible) | May take a quarry instead of plantation |
| **Mayor** | Take 1 colonist from ship; reallocate colonists | Take 1 colonist from supply |
| **Builder** | Buy 1 building (pay cost minus quarry discounts) | Pay 1 doubloon less |
| **Craftsman** | Produce goods (corn: plantation only; others: building + colonists) | Take 1 extra good |
| **Trader** | Sell 1 good to Trading House (no duplicates) | +1 doubloon |
| **Captain** | Ship goods (1 VP per barrel; must ship if able) | +1 VP for first load |
| **Prospector** | No action | Gain 1 doubloon |

#### Building Rules  
- Each building may be built only once per game.  
- Buildings require **city spaces** (1 for small, 2 adjacent for large).  
- **Quarry Discount**: Each occupied quarry reduces building cost by 1 doubloon, up to column maximum (shown on board).  
- **Privilege Buildings**:  
  - *University*: Place 1 colonist on newly built building.  
  - *Hospice*: Place 1 colonist on newly settled plantation/quarry.  
  - *Hacienda*: Take 1 face-down plantation before normal turn.

#### Production & Goods  
- **Corn**: Only needs occupied plantation.  
- **Other goods**: Need occupied plantation + matching occupied production building.  
- **Factory**: Grants doubloons based on number of *types* of goods produced:  
  - 2 types: +1 doubloon  
  - 3 types: +2 doubloons  
  - 4 types: +3 doubloons  
  - 5 types: +5 doubloons  

#### Trading  
- Trading House holds up to 4 goods, 1 of each type.  
- **Office**: Allows selling a good even if already in Trading House.  
- **Markets**:  
  - Small Market: +1 doubloon when selling  
  - Large Market: +2 doubloons when selling  
- If Trading House fills, phase ends; goods return to supply.

#### Shipping (Captain Phase)  
- Each ship carries only **one type** of good.  
- No two ships may carry the same type.  
- Players must load **as much as possible** of one good type.  
- **Harbor**: +1 VP per load (including via Wharf).  
- **Wharf**: Once per phase, "ship" all of one good type to your own ship (score 1 VP per barrel).  
- **Spoiling**: After shipping, each player may keep:  
  - 1 barrel of any type  
  - + all barrels of 1 type (Small Warehouse)  
  - + all barrels of 2 types (Large Warehouse)  
  - All excess goods return to supply.

#### Mayor Phase Colonist Refill  
- After all players take colonists:  
  - Count total **empty building circles** (not plantations).  
  - Refill Colonist Ship with that many colonists.  
  - Minimum: 1 per player.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Triggers (game ends at end of round if any occur):  
- Not enough colonists to refill the Colonist Ship.  
- Any player occupies their **12th city space**.  
- Last VP chip is taken.

#### Final Scoring:  
1. **VP Chips**: All VPs earned during game (shipping, roles, buildings).  
2. **Building VPs**: Red number on each building (counts even if unoccupied).  
3. **Large Building Bonuses** (only if **occupied**):  
   - Guild Hall: 1 VP per small production building + 2 VP per large  
   - Residence: 4/5/6/7 VP for 9/10/11/12 occupied spaces  
   - Fortress: 1 VP per 3 colonists  
   - Customs House: 1 VP per 4 VPs earned (excluding building VPs)  
   - City Hall: 1 VP per violet building (including itself)  

#### Tiebreaker:  
Player with the most **doubloons + goods** (1 good = 1 doubloon) wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Privilege Requirement**: Must perform the action to get the privilege.  
- **Unoccupied Buildings**: Do nothing (except score VPs).  
- **Quarry Limits**: Max discount per column is fixed (e.g., Column 1: max 1 quarry discount).  
- **Hacienda + Construction Hut**: Cannot use both to take two quarries. Hacienda draws face-down; Construction Hut only applies to face-up tiles.  
- **Office Use**: Can sell same good type already in Trading House, but Trading House still holds max 4 goods.  
- **Wharf Use**: Counts as a "load" for Harbor bonus. Can be used even if regular ships are available.  
- **Factory Timing**: Doubloons awarded during Craftsman phase, after production.  
- **Secret VPs**: VP chips are hidden; final score is revealed only at end.
