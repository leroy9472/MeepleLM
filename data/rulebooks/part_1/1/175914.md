# FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Food Chain Magnate*, each player is the CEO of a fast food chain competing for customers in a growing city. The game simulates business strategy through hiring, training, marketing, and sales. Players build their company structure using employee cards and vie for control of demand on a dynamic map. The objective is to accumulate the most money by the end of the game.

The game ends when the bank runs out of money for the second time. The player with the most money wins. Ties are broken by turn order (earlier player wins).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of 7 phases:

1. **Restructuring**  
   Players secretly choose which employees are "at work" and which are "on the beach." Reveal and build company structure as a pyramid with CEO on top.

2. **Order of Business**  
   Players choose turn order based on number of open slots in their company structure (most open slots chooses first; tiebreaker: previous turn order).

3. **Working 9:00–5:00**  
   In turn order, each player performs actions for all employees at work, in this order:
   - Recruit
   - Train
   - Initiate Marketing Campaigns
   - Get Food & Drinks
   - Place New Houses and Gardens
   - Place or Move Restaurants

4. **Dinnertime**  
   Houses attempt to eat in numerical order. Resolve demand based on opportunity cost (unit price + distance), with tiebreakers.

5. **Payday**  
   Players may fire employees (except busy marketeers). Pay $5 salary for each employee with a money symbol.

6. **Marketing Campaigns**  
   Apply effects of active campaigns in numerical order. Each places one demand token on reachable houses.

7. **Clean Up**  
   - Discard unsold food/drink (unless player has freezer).
   - Return all employee cards to hand (except busy marketeers).
   - Flip "COMING SOON!" restaurants to "WELCOME."
   - Remove milestone cards that were claimed this turn.

Repeat until the bank breaks for the second time.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Company Structure
- Employees are arranged in a pyramid.
- CEO is always at work and has 3 initial slots.
- Managers (black cards) can have 2–10 subordinates.
- Only non-manager employees can be under managers.
- Managers cannot report to other managers.
- If more employees are played than fit, only CEO remains at work.

#### Actions (Phase 3)
All actions are performed in fixed order:

**A. Recruit**  
- Each recruitment action allows hiring one entry-level employee (marked with ▶).
- Recruiting Girl: 1 action
- Recruiting Manager: 2 actions
- HR Director: 4 actions
- If a card is unavailable, you may still "hire" it by immediately training it to a higher level (phantom hire).

**B. Train**  
- Each training action allows one employee on the beach to be upgraded.
- Return original card to supply, take new one to beach.
- Cannot train an employee more than once per turn unless ability allows.
- Intermediate cards need not be available during multi-step training.
- Cannot train employees currently at work or busy marketeers.

**C. Initiate Marketing Campaigns**  
- Each marketeer at work may place one campaign.
- Types and ranges:
  - Marketing Trainee: billboard only, range 2
  - Campaign Manager: billboard or mailbox, range 3
  - Brand Manager: billboard, mailbox, airplane, no range limit
  - Brand Director: any type, no range limit
- Duration: 1 to max listed on card (e.g., Trainee: max 2 turns)
- Placement:
  - Billboards, mailboxes, radios: on empty map square adjacent to a road
  - Airplanes: placed off-board, aligned with row/column
- Place wooden food/drink pieces equal to duration.
- Set marketeer aside with busy marker.

**D. Get Food & Drinks**  
- Kitchen Trainee: 1 burger or pizza
- Burger Cook / Chef: number of burgers listed
- Pizza Cook / Chef: number of pizzas listed
- Errand Boy: 1 drink of choice
- Cart Operator: range 2, 2 drinks per symbol passed
- Truck Driver: range 3, 3 drinks per symbol
- Zeppelin Pilot: range 4, 2 drinks per symbol (no roads, no U-turns)

**E. Place New Houses and Gardens**  
- New Business Developer allows:
  - Place a new house adjacent to any road
  - Place a garden adjacent to a gardenless house to form 2×3 rectangle
- Each house may have only one garden.

**F. Place or Move Restaurants**  
- Local Manager: place new restaurant within range 3 (by road) from existing restaurant. Placed "COMING SOON!" side up.
- Regional Manager: place or move any restaurant anywhere (entrance must face road). Immediate effect.
- With either manager at work, all your restaurants have drive-ins (entrances on all corners).

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Dinnertime (Phase 4)
- Houses eat in numerical order.
- Must have full demand met and road connection.
- Opportunity Cost = Unit Price + Distance
  - Unit Price: base $10; modified by:
    - Pricing Manager: –$1
    - Discount Manager: –$3
    - Luxury Manager: +$10
    - First to Lower Prices milestone: –$1
  - Distance: number of tile borders crossed from house to restaurant entrance
- Tiebreakers:
  1. Lowest opportunity cost
  2. Most waitresses
  3. Earlier turn order
- Income:
  - Per item sold: unit price
  - If house has garden: double unit price (bonuses not doubled)
  - Add milestone bonuses: +$5 per burger, pizza, or drink sold (if achieved respective "First Marketed" milestone)
- After all houses: $3 per waitress ($5 if "First Waitress Played" milestone)
- CFO or "First to Have $100" milestone: +50% to total income (rounded up)

#### Bank Breaks
- **First Break**: Reveal all face-down reserve cards. Add total to bank.
  - Determine CEO slots: most common slot number on reserve cards wins (tie: highest number).
  - All CEOs now have that many slots.
- **Second Break**: Game ends after Phase 4. Finish all payouts (IOUs allowed). Highest money wins.
