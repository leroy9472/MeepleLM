# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective  
In Ark Nova, players plan and build a modern, scientifically managed zoo. The goal is to balance appeal and conservation: attract visitors by adding diverse animals and increasing appeal, while supporting conservation projects to gain conservation points. The game ends when a player’s Conservation counter and Appeal counter meet or cross on the scoring track. Victory is determined by combining appeal with a base value from the conservation scoring area. The player with the highest victory points wins.

## 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Players take turns clockwise.  
- On your turn:  
  1. Choose one Action card.  
  2. Perform its action at strength X (slot number).  
  3. Optionally use X-tokens to increase strength (1 per token).  
  4. After action, move chosen card to slot 1, shift others right.  
- If the Break token reaches the end of the Break track during any action, a Break occurs after the turn ends.  
- Game ends when Conservation and Appeal counters meet or cross.  

## 5. Core Mechanics  

### Action Cards  
Each action is governed by the card’s position (slot 1–5). Strength = slot number + X-tokens used.  

#### Cards Action  
- Advance Break token 2 spaces.  
- **Side I**:  
  - Draw cards from deck per table; discard 1 if indicated.  
  - OR: If strength ≥ 5, "Snap" — take 1 card from display.  
- **Side II (upgraded)**:  
  - Draw from deck and/or display (within reputation range).  
  - Snap at strength ≥ 3.  
  - Can exceed reputation 9.  

#### Build Action  
- **Side I**:  
  - Build exactly 1 building:  
    - Standard enclosures (size 1–5)  
    - Petting Zoo (1 per zoo)  
    - Kiosk, Pavilion  
  - Cost: 2 money per space.  
  - Must be adjacent to existing building (or on border for first).  
  - Cannot build on spaces marked ; cannot build Reptile House or Large Bird Aviary.  
- **Side II (upgraded)**:  
  - Build multiple different buildings (total size ≤ X).  
  - Can build Reptile House and Large Bird Aviary (1 each).  
  - Can build on spaces.  
  - When building Reptile House or Aviary, may immediately move qualifying animals from standard enclosures into it.  

#### Animals Action  
- **Side I**:  
  - Play up to number of Animal cards indicated by strength.  
  - Steps per animal:  
    1. **Check conditions**: partner zoo, icon requirements, etc.  
    2. **Pay cost**: full cost; reduced by 3 per continent icon if matching partner zoo.  
    3. **Fill enclosure**:  
       - Standard: flip empty enclosure (≥ size, meets water/rock requirements)  
       - Special: place player tokens in Petting Zoo, Reptile House, or Large Bird Aviary  
    4. **Place card** next to zoo map.  
    5. **Execute effects**: immediate (including appeal, reputation, conservation).  
- **Side II (upgraded)**:  
  - May play animals from display (within reputation range), paying additional money equal to folder number.  
  - At strength ≥ 5, may increase reputation by 1 at start of action.  
  - Can play animals requiring upgraded Animals action.

- Gain 2nd partner zoo  
- Gain 2nd university  
- Reach 2+ on Conservation track  
- Reach 5+ on Conservation track (choose alternative)  

### Reputation Track & Display  
- Reputation determines "reputation range": cards in display at or below your reputation level.  
- Increase reputation to gain bonuses (once). At 15, each additional reputation gives 1 appeal.  
- Upgraded Cards action allows reputation >9.  

### Conservation Projects  
- Two types:  
  1. **Icon-based**: require specific number of icons (from cards, zoos, universities).  
  2. **Release into Wild**: discard matching animal (correct enclosure size); lose appeal; gain conservation.  
- Support each project only once.  
- Base projects are always available; others rotate above Association board (max 2/3/4 for 2/3/4 players).  

### Income & Breaks  
Break occurs when Break token reaches end of track. After current turn:  
1. Discard down to hand limit (3, or 5 with university).  
2. Remove Multiplier, Venom, Constriction tokens from Action cards.  
3. Return all association workers to notepad.  
4. Replenish partner zoos and universities.  
5. Discard display folders 1 and 2; shift cards down; refill from deck.  
6. Gain income:  
   a. **Appeal income**: money based on Appeal track position.  
   b. **Kiosk income**: for each kiosk, 1 money per adjacent:  
      - Unique building  
      - Special enclosure  
      - Pavilion  
      - Occupied standard enclosure  
   c. **Sponsor/income bonuses**: recurring income from cards and activated zoo map bonuses.  
7. Reset Break token to starting space.  

## 6. Scoring & End Game  

### End Game Trigger  
- At end of turn: if your Conservation and Appeal counters are in same scoring area or have crossed, game ends after all other players take one more turn.  
- During Break: if any player’s counters meet or cross, all players (including trigger) take one more turn.  

### Final Scoring  
1. **10 Conservation Points Rule**:  
   - If no player reached 10 conservation points, all players discard one Final Scoring card.  
2. **Score Cards**:  
   - Gain appeal/conservation from Final Scoring cards.  
   - Gain endgame effects from Sponsor cards (brown hourglass).  
   - +7 appeal if zoo map fully covered (excluding water/rock).  
   - +1 appeal per pavilion.  
3. **Victory Points**:  
   - Find white number in space where Conservation counter is.  
   - Victory Points = Appeal value + white number.  
   - Highest VP wins.  

### Tiebreakers  
1. Most supported Conservation Projects (tokens removed from zoo map).  
2. If still tied, players share victory.  

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Hand Limit**: Enforced only during Break.  
- **X-tokens**: Max 5. Cannot use during action to boost that same action if gained during it.  
- **"After Finishing" Effects**: Execute after moving Action card to slot 1.  
- **Cards Count Themselves**: Icon on card counts for effects.  
- **Double Icons**: Trigger effects twice.  
- **Constriction/Venom**: Affect action strength; removed after use or during Break.  
- **Flock Animals**: Can be played without flipping enclosure if matching herbivore already present.  
- **Solo Play**: Special setup; 6 rounds; win with ≥100 VP.
