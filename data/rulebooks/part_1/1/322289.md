- Place Land and Ocean Adventure tokens (player count dependent).
- Place HMS Beagle on the leftmost Beagle space.

**Player Setup:**
- Each player chooses a color and takes:
  - 4 Workers (place 4 on board; 5th unlocked later)
  - 5 Tents (on board)
  - 3 Explorers (1 on starting island)
  - 1 Ship (on leftmost Ocean space)
  - 12 Stamps (3 stacks of 4)
  - 6 Personal Lens tokens
  - 4 Coins and 1 Temporary Knowledge token
  - Markers at 0 on VP, Theory of Evolution, Turn Order, and Time tracks
- Deal 4 Crew cards; draft 3, discard rest.
- Place matching wax seals from Crew cards on leftmost spaces of 3 worker rows.
- Draft 1 silver/gold Objective pair; place in reserve.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the 5 rounds consists of 4 phases:

**1. Action Phase:**
- Players take turns placing one worker at a time (turn order from previous round).
- Place a worker on an available action space or pass.
- Pay any penalties (2 Coins in 3–4p, 3 in 2p) if the Diary section already has workers.
- Pay action costs and resolve all effects immediately.
- Actions include:
  - **Academy:** Take 1 wax seal from a scroll; pay scroll and placement costs.
  - **Exploration:** Move 1 Explorer up to value shown; skip occupied spaces.
  - **Navigation:** Move 1 Ship up to value shown.
  - **Correspondence:** Place up to X stamps on one envelope; perform stack-clearing actions.
  - **Unlock Lens:** Pay cost to place personal lens on locked location; perform its actions once.
  - **Establish Campsite:** Place a Tent on an empty campsite; perform site and Tent actions.
  - **Deliver Specimen:** Deliver a researched specimen to the Museum; gain rewards.
  - **Research Museum Specimen:** Mark a Museum specimen on your board.
  - **Reserve Turn Order:** Place worker in magnifying glass; gain 2 (3 in 2p) Coins.
  - **Gain Objective:** Take an Objective tile; place in reserve or on board.
- Achieve Objectives or Crew Cards at any time during your turn if requirements are met.

**2. Turn Order Phase:**
- If workers are on the Turn Order space, rearrange turn order so the leftmost worker is first.
- Other players follow in relative order.

**3. Reward Phase:**
- **Correspondence Majorities:** For each envelope:
  - 1st place (most stamps): perform top reward.
  - 2nd place: perform bottom reward.
  - Ties: all tied players perform the reward.
  - All reward recipients remove half their stamps (rounded up) to the used tray.
- **Beagle Goal Scoring:**
  - Score VPs for meeting the condition on the Beagle Goal tile below the HMS Beagle.
  - Subtract Lagging Penalties (each threshold between your Ship and the Beagle).
  - Minimum 0 VPs earned.
  - Flip tile face down.

**4. Cleanup Phase (skip in Round 5):**
- Move HMS Beagle to next Beagle Goal space.
- Return all workers to player boards.
- Refill Objective display: remove old, draw 2 new silver and 2 gold.
- Refill Academy: remove top scroll’s seals; shift others up; refill from supply.
- (Firelands) Advance Alfred’s Bonus Track if playing solo.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Wax Seal Requirements:** Workers must meet color/quantity requirements to place on action spaces. Purple seals are wild. Temporary Knowledge tokens can substitute for seals during placement (but not for Crew Cards).
- **Distinctions:** Workers gain silver (4th seal) and gold (6th seal) laurels. These grant bonuses when placing in Diaries:
  - Silver: +1 action (move, stamp, seal, or 2 Coins).
  - Gold: Extra stop during movement, split stamps, -1 Coin in Academy, or 3 VP.
- **Crew Cards:** Achieved when a worker has the required seals (order irrelevant). Flip card, assign to worker, perform actions. Purple seals count; Temporary Knowledge does not.
- **Objectives:** Complete by meeting requirements. Flip, pay placement cost, perform reward. Rewards include VP, research, discounts, and worker unlock.
- **Lens Unlocking:** Main Diary actions must be unlocked top to bottom per page. Special Diary actions can be unlocked in any order. Unlocking grants one-time use of the action.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
After Round 5, proceed to Final Scoring:

1. **Personal Board:**
   - Score VP for each achieved Objective.
   - +4 VP if both rightmost silver and gold Objectives are achieved.
   - +3 VP per worker with 5 wax seals.
   - +7 VP per worker with 6 wax seals (additional to 5-seal bonus).
   - +5 VP if all 5 Tents are placed.

2. **Theory of Evolution Track:**
   - Museum Modifier = 2 + number of fully completed Museum rows.
   - Multiply Modifier by number of Book spaces reached/passed on track (including endgame +1 from Objective).
   - Score total VP.

3. **Coins and Knowledge:**
   - +1 VP per 5 Coins.
   - +1 VP per Temporary Knowledge token.

**Tiebreakers:**
1. Farthest on Theory of Evolution track.
2. Most Coins.
3. Shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Academy Discounts:** Apply to total cost (scroll + placement), including Time Track penalties (Firelands).
- **Zero Movement:** Not allowed; minimum 1 space for Exploration/Navigation.
- **Tents:** Only one per campsite.
- **Seal Supply:** Limited; if exhausted, no more seals available.
- **Correspondence Rewards:** Stamps placed during rewards affect future rounds only.
- **Skipping Rewards:** You may skip a Correspondence reward, but must still remove half your stamps.
- **Lagging Penalty Cap:** If an Objective reduces penalties to max -2, each threshold is capped at -2 (e.g., 3 behind = -6 total).
- **Adventure Tokens:** When passing, draw card and resolve during your turn as a bonus action. Reshuffle discards if deck runs out.
