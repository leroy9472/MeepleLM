# Slay the Spire — Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Slay the Spire is a cooperative rogue-like deckbuilding adventure. Players take on the role of one of four characters attempting to climb a mysterious and ever-changing Spire. The goal is to grow stronger by improving their deck, collecting powerful relics, and defeating increasingly dangerous enemies and bosses. Victory is achieved by defeating the final boss of the chosen Act. Death occurs when any player’s HP reaches 0, resulting in game over.

- **Hand Size**: No maximum
- **Block vs HP Loss**: Block only prevents damage, not "Lose HP" effects
- **Token Limits**: Cannot gain more tokens than available; effect ignored
- **Cards Have No Memory**: Once played, cards don’t remember prior effects (e.g., Retain, cost changes)
- **Summon Behavior**: Summons stay in combat even if summoner dies
- **Multi-hit & Buffs**: All hits affected equally; Weak/Vulnerable removed after full attack
- **Playing Copies**: Multiple copies are separate; no Energy cost; each can have different targets
- **Golden Rule**: Card text overrides rulebook in case of conflict
