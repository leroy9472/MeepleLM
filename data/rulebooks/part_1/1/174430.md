### 1. Lore & Objective
Gloomhaven is a cooperative, campaign-driven dungeon-crawling game where players take on the roles of mercenaries exploring a dark fantasy world. The overarching goal is to complete scenarios, progress the story, unlock new content, and develop characters through experience, items, and perks.

The campaign progresses through linked scenarios, global achievements, and character personal quests. Players may play in **Campaign Mode**, following a story path with persistent progression, or **Casual Mode**, replaying unlocked scenarios without story rewards.

Victory in a scenario is achieved by fulfilling its specific success conditions. Failure occurs if all characters are exhausted before success. Even upon failure, players retain earned XP and loot.

### 2. Components
- Character mats, ability cards, and miniatures
- Monster stat cards, ability decks, and standees
- Attack modifier decks (player and monster)
- Scenario map tiles, overlay tiles (doors, traps, hazardous terrain, etc.)
- Tokens: HP, damage, money, conditions, elemental infusions
- Battle goal cards, personal quest cards
- Item cards and item design cards
- City and Road Event decks
- Campaign board, party sheet, character sheets
- Prosperity and reputation trackers
- Elemental infusion table
- Round tracker

### 3. Setup
1. **Choose Scenario**: Ensure prerequisites (global/party achievements) are met for Campaign Mode.
2. **Draw Road Event**: Only if traveling to a scenario not linked to the previous one or Gloomhaven.
3. **Set Scenario Level (L)**:
   - Recommended: Average character level / 2, rounded up.
   - Solo play: Increase Monster Level and Trap Damage by 1.
4. **Build Map**: Use Scenario Book to place map tiles and doors. Only reveal the starting room initially.
5. **Place Starting Elements**:
   - Place monsters, overlay tiles, and money tokens only in the starting room.
   - Use placement symbols (upper left: 2 players, upper right: 3, bottom: 4) — black: none, white: normal, gold: elite.
6. **Prepare Decks**:
   - Shuffle player attack modifier decks (standard: 6×+0, 5×+1, 5×−1, 1×+2, 1×−2, 1×2×, 1×Null).
   - Shuffle monster attack modifier deck (same composition, labeled "M").
   - Shuffle monster ability decks (e.g., Guard, Archer, Living Bones).
7. **Set Up Tracking**:
   - Elemental infusion table: all 6 elements in "Inert".
   - Damage, money, and condition token piles.
8. **Player Setup**:
   - Each player selects a character class (only one per class per scenario).
   - Set HP and XP trackers to level 1 values.
   - Receive 30 gold.
   - Equip items (head, body, legs: 1 each; hands: up to 2 one-hand or 1 two-hand; small items: level / 2, rounded up).
   - Choose 2 battle goal cards, keep 1 secretly.
   - Select ability cards for hand (up to hand size on character mat; start with level 1 cards).
9. **Apply Effects**: Read scenario intro and apply special rules.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Card Selection**:
   - Each player selects 2 ability cards face-down. One is leading (determines initiative).
   - Long rest if unable to play 2 cards.
2. **Determine Initiative**:
   - Reveal player leading cards and monster ability cards.
   - Order: lowest initiative to highest.
   - Tiebreakers: non-leading card, then players decide.
   - Players act before monsters on initiative tie.
3. **Character and Monster Turns**:
   - On your turn: perform top action of one card, bottom action of the other (order on card matters).
   - Use items before, during, or after actions.
   - Monsters follow automated rules: focus, move, attack per ability card.
4. **End of Round**:
   - Resolve 2× or Null: shuffle discard pile into deck at round end.
   - Move elemental infusions: Strong → Waning → Inert.
   - Clear active round bonuses.
   - Perform short rests (optional).
   - Advance round tracker if needed.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Attack**:
  - Base damage modified by attack modifier card.
  - Advantage: draw 2 cards, use best.
  - Disadvantage: draw 2, use worst.
  - Area attacks: each target is separate attack (separate modifier card).
  - Line of sight blocked only by walls.
- **Damage & Healing**:
  - Reduce HP or negate damage by losing 1 card from hand or 2 from discard.
  - Heal removes Wound and/or Poison tokens:
    - Poison: heal removes token, no HP restored.
    - Wound: heal removes token, normal HP gain.
    - Both: heal removes both, no HP gain.
- **Conditions**:
  - Only one of each type per figure.
  - Negative conditions apply even if attack does 0 damage.
  - Immune icons on monster stat cards indicate immunity.
- **Elemental Infusions**:
  - Using an elemental ability moves element to "Strong".
  - At end of round: Strong → Waning → Inert.
  - Can be consumed to augment abilities (not on same turn created).
  - Monsters always consume if able; all monsters of type benefit.
- **Summoning**:
  - Summon acts before summoner (initiative -1).
  - Uses Move+0, Attack+0, player’s modifier deck.
  - Cannot pick up loot.
  - Removed if summoner exhausted or ability card removed.
- **Resting**:
  - **Short Rest**: during cleanup. Shuffle discard, lose 1 randomly, rest to hand. Optional: suffer 1 damage to choose which to lose.
  - **Long Rest**: entire turn. Lose 1 from discard, return rest to hand. Heal 2, refresh items.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
