# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In *Race for the Galaxy*, players compete to build the most prosperous and powerful space empire. The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VPs) by settling worlds, developing technologies, producing and consuming goods, and strategically selecting game phases. The game ends when a player has 12 or more cards in their tableau or the initial VP pool is exhausted. The player with the highest VP total wins, with ties broken by the number of cards in hand and goods on worlds.

## 2. Components
- **Game Cards**: 114 cards (59 worlds, 50 developments, 5 start worlds)
- **Action Cards**: 7 different types per player (28 total), plus 8 duplicates for 2-player expert game
- **VP Chips**: 28 chips (18 × 1 VP, 6 × 5 VP, 4 × 10 VP)
- **Card Supply**: Formed from shuffled game cards after setup
- **Discard Pile**: Face-down pile for discarded cards

## 3. Setup
- **VP Pool**: Place 12 VP chips per player in a common pool; set aside extra chips for later use.
- **Action Cards**: Each player takes one of each of the 7 action cards (9 total in 2-player expert game).
- **Start Worlds**: Shuffle the 5 start worlds and deal one face up to each player. Return unused start worlds to the deck.
- **Initial Cards**: Shuffle remaining cards and deal 6 to each player. Each player discards 2 cards face down.
- **Windfall Goods**: Place a face-down card (good) on Alpha Centauri if in play.
- **Card Supply**: Remaining cards form the draw deck.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds in the following order, skipping phases not selected by any player:

### A: Action Selection
- All players simultaneously and secretly choose one (or two in 2-player expert game) action cards.
- Reveal all selected cards. Selected phases are executed in order: I. Explore, II. Develop, III. Settle, IV. Consume, V. Produce.

### I: Explore Phase
- **Action (All Players)**: Draw 2 cards, then keep 1 and discard 1.
- **Bonuses (Selecting Players Only)**:
  - *Explore: +5*: Draw 5 additional cards before choosing which to keep (total: draw 7, keep 1).
  - *Explore: +1, +1*: Draw 1 additional card and keep 1 additional card (total: draw 3, keep 2).
- In 2-player expert game, selecting both Explore bonuses results in drawing 8 cards and keeping 2.

### II: Develop Phase
- **Action (All Players)**: May place one development face down from hand.
- **Start of Phase Powers**: Players with "start of phase" Develop powers draw cards.
- **Reveal and Pay**: All players reveal developments. Pay cost by discarding cards equal to the development's diamond cost.
- **Bonus (Selecting Players Only)**: Discard one fewer card when paying (minimum cost: 0).
- **End of Phase**: Powers on newly placed developments activate next phase.
- **Additional Phase**: If any player selected two Develop actions, a second full Develop phase occurs (bonus applies to each).

### III: Settle Phase
- **Action (All Players)**: May place one world face down from hand.
- **Reveal and Pay/Conquer**:
  - *Non-Military Worlds (black circle)*: Pay by discarding cards equal to cost.
  - *Military Worlds (red circle)*: Conquer by having total Military ≥ defense value. No card payment.
  - *Contact Specialist*: Allows paying for a non-Alien military world at cost = defense - 1.
  - *Colony Ship*: Allows Contact Specialist to place a non-Alien military world at no cost.
- **Windfall Worlds (colored halo)**: Immediately place a face-down good on the world when settled.
- **Bonus (Selecting Players Only)**: Draw one card after placing a world.
- **Temporary Military**: Cards like *New Military Tactics* can be discarded for +3 Military until end of phase.
- **End of Phase**: Temporary military ends; new world powers activate next phase.
- **Additional Phase**: If any player selected two Settle actions, a second full Settle phase occurs (bonus applies to each).

### IV: Consume Phase
- **Action (All Players, Mandatory if Possible)**: Use all applicable consume powers to discard goods for VPs and/or cards.
  - Powers must be used if possible and to fullest extent when invoked.
  - Powers may be used in any order.
  - A good may be consumed even if not on the consuming world.
- **Bonuses (Selecting Players Only)**:
  - *Consume: $1:Trade*: Must sell one good (discard) before using other consume powers. Draw cards based on good type:
    - Alien Technology: 5 cards
    - Genes: 4 cards
    - Rare Elements: 3 cards
    - Novelty: 2 cards
    - Trade powers apply to this sale.
  - *Consume: 2x VPs*: Double VPs from all consume powers (except VPs from discarding hand cards).
- In 2-player expert game, selecting both Consume bonuses requires selling one good first, then consuming others for 2x VPs.

### V: Produce Phase
- **Action (All Players)**: Place a face-down good on each production world (colored solid circle) that lacks a good.
  - Good type matches world color.
  - Some worlds (e.g., Gem World) draw a card when producing.
- **Bonus (Selecting Players Only)**: Produce a good on one windfall world that lacks a good.

### E: Round End
- **Discards**: All players discard down to 10 cards.
- **Reclaim Action Cards**: All players take back their played action cards.
- **Check for Game End**: If any player has ≥12 cards in tableau or initial VP pool is empty, game ends after this round.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Card Uses**: Cards are used as (1) developments/worlds, (2) payment (discarded as money), or (3) goods (face-down on worlds).
- **Powers**:
  - Standard powers use icons; special powers have text.
  - Powers are cumulative and modify only the rules described.
  - Powers take effect starting in the phase *after* placement.
  - Mandatory unless "may" is used; must be fully resolved.
  - Resolved sequentially; cannot interrupt one power with another.
- **Costs**: Cannot be reduced below 0. Discounts apply before payment.
- **Military**:
  - Permanent and temporary (+3 from *New Military Tactics*).
  - Specialized (e.g., +4 vs Rebel worlds).
  - Total military must meet or exceed defense to conquer.
  - Cannot combine military and payment for military worlds.
- **Simultaneous Play**: Most actions are simultaneous; use player order (lowest start world number, then clockwise) for edge cases (e.g., limited card supply, VP exhaustion).

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game Ends** when:
  - Any player has 12 or more cards in their tableau, OR
  - No VP chips remain in the initial VP pool.
- **Final Scoring**:
  - VPs from cards in tableau (hex value).
  - VP chips collected.
  - Variable VPs from 6-cost developments (based on criteria met).
- **Winner**: Highest total VP.
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with the most cards in hand (after discarding) and goods on worlds. If still tied, all tied players win.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Empty Card Supply**: Immediately shuffle discard pile into a new supply.
- **VP Chip Shortage**: Use extra chips or track on paper.
- **Player Information**: All VP chips and hand sizes are public.
- **Timing Conflicts**: Use player order (lowest start world number, then clockwise) when order matters (e.g., final round, limited supply).
- **2-Player Expert Game**:
  - Each player has 9 action cards, selects 2 per round.
  - Selecting two Develop or Settle actions triggers two sequential phases.
  - Powers from first phase apply in second.
  - Opponent selecting one of the same actions gets bonus only in first phase.
  - Selecting both Consume bonuses requires Trade first, then 2x VPs.
