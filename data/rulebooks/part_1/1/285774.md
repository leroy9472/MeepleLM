  - Unique character already in play: discard and draw new encounter.  
  - If Obligation cannot be assigned: remove from game, draw new card.  
  - If Encounter Deck and discard pile are empty: players lose.

6. Scoring & End Game

- **Losing:**  
  - Any player’s identity is defeated.  
  - Main Scheme completes (advances past final stage).  
  - Encounter Deck and discard pile are both empty.  
- **Victory Display:** Cards with Victory X go here when defeated. Used for scoring or effects in campaign modes.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you attack if engaged with Guard minion?** No, cannot attack the villain. Other damage sources still apply.  
- **Does Overkill trigger if target has Tough?** No. Tough prevents damage from being “taken,” so Overkill does not trigger.  
- **Can multiple instances of Retaliate stack?** Yes. Each instance resolves separately.  
- **Does Requirement allow ignoring resource cost?** No. The specified resources must be spent.  
- **What happens if you exceed Ally limit?** Must discard an Ally before resolving “enter play” abilities.  
- **Can you play cards during another player’s turn?** Only Action abilities or Events with timing triggers.  
- **Does damage move through multiple Overkill targets?** No. Overkill damage is dealt only once (to identity or villain).  
- **Can you defend an attack with an exhausted Ally?** No. Defender must be ready.  
- **Does Villainous boost card stay in play?** No. Discarded after activation.
