# UNDERWATER CITIES — COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE MANUAL

### 1. Lore & Objective
The Earth is overpopulated, and Mars colonization remains distant. Humanity's last frontier is beneath the sea. Players compete to build the most advanced underwater nation—an archipelago of cities connected by tunnels, sustained by farms, desalination plants, and laboratories. The goal is to create a self-sustaining civilization, possibly exporting resources to the struggling world above. Victory is achieved by earning the most victory points through network development, production, and final scoring.

### 3. Setup
1. **Board Setup**  
   - Use 2-player side or 3–4-player side based on player count.
   - Place Era I deck on the board; set era marker on "1".
   - In 4-player games, place the action-cloning tile on the board.

2. **Player Setup**

     - 3 action tiles
     - 1 personal assistant card
     - 1 final scoring card
     - 1 player info card
     - 1 player board (randomly assigned; use side #1–4 for basic game)
   - Place starting nonsymbiotic city (white dome) on the lower-right corner of the player board.

3. **Metropolis Tiles**  
   - Shuffle brown metropolis tiles; deal one to each player. Place it in the upper-left hex on the player board.
   - Shuffle blue metropolis tiles; deal two to each player. Randomly assign to the two remaining hex spaces.

4. **Order of Play**  
   - Randomly place one marker from each player on the play-order track.
   - On the Federation track, place markers in reverse order:
     - 1st player: below track (on color-matched space)
     - 2nd player: space 4
     - 3rd player: space 3 (gains 1 extra credit)
     - 4th player: space 2 (gains 1 extra credit and 1 steelplast)

5. **Resources & Cards**  
   - Each player starts with: 1 kelp, 1 steelplast, 1 science, 2 credits.
   - Deal 6 Era I cards to each player. Choose 3 to keep; discard 3.

6. **Special Cards**  
   - Shuffle 1–2 credit special cards; place deck face down. Flip top card face up.
   - Place 6 random 3-credit special cards face up on the board.

7. **Government Contracts (Optional Variant)**  
   - Shuffle 8 contract cards; place 3 randomly face up on the board. Return rest to box.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Game lasts 10 rounds, divided into 3 eras:
  - Era I: Rounds 1–4
  - Era II: Rounds 5–7
  - Era III: Rounds 8–10
- Each round: 3 turns per player (in play-order track order).
- After each round: advance era marker.
- After rounds 4, 7, and 10: trigger Production phase.

**Turn Sequence**:
1. Discard down to 3 cards (if needed).
2. Play one card and choose one unoccupied action slot (or the always-available slot).
3. If card color matches slot color, resolve card effect (before or after action).
4. Perform at least part of the action slot’s effect.
5. Draw 1 card at end of turn.

**End of Round**:
1. Return all action tiles to owners.
2. In 4-player games, return action-cloning tile.
3. Reorder play-order markers based on Federation track (top of stack goes first).
4. Move all Federation markers below space 4.
5. Advance era marker.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Action Slots & Card Matching**  
  - 3 colored action slots (green, red, yellow). Each has a strength-inverse relationship:
    - Green: weakest actions, strongest card effects
    - Red: moderate
    - Yellow: strongest actions, weakest card effects
  - If card color matches slot color, resolve card effect.
  - If no match, discard card (no effect).
  - Always perform at least part of the slot’s action.

- **Card Types**  
  - **Instant (⚡)**: Resolve effect once, then discard.
  - **Permanent (∞)**: Ongoing effect; place near board.
  - **Action (A)**: Can be used when slot or card allows; limited to 1 use per era (rotate to indicate used).
  - **Production (⚙️)**: Triggers during Production phase.
  - **End-Scoring (⏱️)**: Triggers during final scoring.
  - **Special Cards (S)**: Drawn via special action; require credit payment to use if color-matched.

- **Hand Limit**  
  - Start each turn with 3 cards.
  - Must discard down to 3 before next turn.
  - Draw 1 card at end of every turn.

- **Action Cards Limit**  
  - Maximum 4 action cards (including Personal Assistant).
  - To claim a 5th, discard one first.
  - If discarded card is unused, use its action immediately.

- **Biomatter Usage**  
  - Can substitute for kelp or steelplast in building costs.
  - Can substitute for kelp to feed cities.

- **Building Rules**  
  - **Tunnel**: Pay 1 steelplast + 1 credit. Must connect to starting city via tunnel network.
  - **Nonsymbiotic City**: Pay 2 steelplast + 1 kelp + 1 credit.
  - **Symbiotic City**: Pay 1 steelplast + 1 kelp + 1 biomatter + 2 credits.
  - **Farm**: Pay 1 kelp.
  - **Desalination Plant**: Pay 1 credit.
  - **Laboratory**: Pay 1 steelplast.
  - Buildings and cities must be adjacent to an existing city or legal build site.

- **Upgrading Structures**  
  - Only buildings and tunnels can be upgraded (not cities).
  - Cost: 1 science (unless card specifies otherwise).
  - Upgrade by stacking a second token (building) or flipping tile (tunnel).
  - Upgraded structures produce more during Production.

- **Your Network**  
  - A city is connected if linked via tunnels to the starting city.
  - A building is connected if adjacent to a connected city.
  - Only connected structures produce or consume during Production.

- **Federation Track**  
  - Advance to gain bonuses (resources, points).
  - Position determines next round’s play order.
  - If advancing beyond space 1, gain 1 point per extra space.

- **Always-Available Slot**  
  - Unlocked even if occupied.
  - Grants 2 cards and 2 credits.
  - No color; card played is discarded without effect.

- **Action-Cloning Tile (4 Players Only)**  
  - Pay 1 credit to use.
  - Place your tile on a slot occupied by another player.
  - Can use card effect if colors match.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Production Phases (After Rounds 4, 7, 10)**:
1. **Produce**:
   - Connected buildings and adjacent tunnels produce.
   - Upgraded structures produce more.
   - Symbiotic cities produce 2 points each.
   - Bonus: 1 extra kelp and 1 extra point if a city has 2 upgraded buildings of the same type.
   - Apply production card and metropolis effects.
2. **Refresh Action Cards**: Rotate all used action cards to upright.
3. **Feed Cities**: Each connected city consumes 1 kelp.
   - If insufficient kelp, pay 1 biomatter per city.
   - If still insufficient, lose 3 points per city.
4. **End of Era**:
   - Remove current era’s deck and discard pile.
   - Shuffle next era’s deck; each player draws 3 cards.
   - Choose 3 to keep from hand (old + new); discard rest.
   - Advance era marker.

**Final Scoring (After Round 10)**:
1. **Brown Metropolis**: Score points if connected by two tunnels.
2. **End-Scoring Cards**: Resolve effects (e.g., convert resources to points).
3. **Connected Cities**:
   - 2 points: no buildings
   - 3 points: 1 type of building
   - 4 points: 2 types of buildings
   - 6 points: all 3 types of buildings
4. **Resources**:
   - Sell biomatter: 2 credits each.
   - Sell remaining resources (kelp, steelplast, science, credits): 1 credit each.
   - Convert every 4 credits into 1 point.

**Winning**:
- Most points wins.
- Tiebreaker: final play order (determined at end of last round).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you use part of an action?**  
  Yes. You may use only part of an action (e.g., build one tunnel instead of two), but must use at least part.

- **Can you use a card effect without using the action?**  
  No. You must use at least part of the action slot’s effect.

- **Can you discard a card even if it matches?**  
  Yes. Card effects are optional.

- **What if you can’t feed all cities?**  
  Pay kelp first, then biomatter, then lose 3 points per unfed city.

- **Do discounts stack?**  
  Yes. Combine multiple discounts, but cost cannot go below "free".

- **Can biomatter pay surcharges?**  
  No. Biomatter can only replace kelp or steelplast in base building costs, not surcharges.

- **Can you use an action card the turn you claim it?**  
  Yes.

- **Do unconnected structures score?**  
  No. Only connected cities and buildings count for scoring and production.

- **Can you use the always-available slot multiple times?**  
  Yes. It is always available, even if used by another player.

- **Can you use a card that lets you use "any occupied slot" on a cloned slot?**  
  Yes. A slot occupied by another player (even if also occupied by you via cloning) counts.

- **Are government contracts replaced when claimed?**  
  No. Once claimed, they are not replaced.
