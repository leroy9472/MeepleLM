### 1. Lore & Objective
In the struggling nation of Hegemony, players take on the roles of one of four classes—Working Class, Middle Class, Capitalist Class, or the State—each with unique goals. The Working Class aims to maximize prosperity by meeting population needs. The Middle Class balances production and consumption to boost prosperity. The Capitalist Class seeks to maximize wealth through profit. The State strives to maintain legitimacy by balancing class interests and managing societal issues. The player with the most Victory Points (VP) after five rounds wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round follows these phases:
1. **Preparation Phase** (skipped in Round 1): Move Round marker. Players perform role-specific steps.
2. **Action Phase**: Players take 5 turns in order: Working Class → Middle Class → Capitalist Class → State. Each turn: 1 Main Action (play card effect or discard for Basic Action), 1 optional Free Action.
3. **Production Phase**: Reverse order: State → Capitalist → Middle → Working. Steps: Produce Goods & Services, Cover Needs, Check IMF, Pay Taxes.
4. **Election Phase**: If Bills exist: Refill Voting Bag, Carry Out Elections for each Bill in order.
5. **Scoring Phase**: Players score VP based on class-specific conditions. State applies Event penalties and scores.

After Round 5: Check Loans, Calculate End-Game Score.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Action Cards**: Draw 5 per round (7 total hand). Play for effect (if policy requirement met) or discard for Basic Action. Free Actions (1 per turn) are class-specific.
- **Committed Workers**: Assigned Workers are turned sideways (committed). They cannot be moved, wages cannot be lowered, and Companies cannot be sold until after Production.
- **Production**: Operational Companies (all Worker slots filled) produce. Wages paid per Company (not per Worker). Workers uncommitted after Production.
- **Policies**: 7 Policies (1-7) with sections A/B/C. Changed via Elections. Affect mechanics like taxes, wages, costs.
- **Elections**: 
  - **Refill Bag**: Working Class adds ⌈Population/2⌉ cubes; Capitalist adds ⌈Operational Companies/2⌉; Middle Class adds max of its Population or Companies. State gains Influence based on lowest Legitimacy (rounded down).
  - **Carry Out Election**: Players declare for/against. Draw 5 cubes. Players secretly spend Influence. "In Favor" wins on tie. Proposer gains 3 VP; supporters with votes gain 1 VP.
- **Tax Multiplier**: Base from Taxation Policy. Modified by Welfare Policies. Used in Employment Tax.
- **Loans**: Taken when unable to pay. Pay 5¥ interest in Preparation. Pay 50¥ to discard (55¥ at end-game). Capitalist loses 5 VP per Loan at end-game.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Round Scoring**:
- **Working Class**: 2 VP per Trade Union.
- **Middle Class**: Gain 1 Prosperity (and VP) if Prosperity < number of fully operational Companies (Middle Class Worker(s) and Working Class Worker if slot exists).
- **Capitalist Class**: Transfer Revenue to Capital. Score VP from Wealth table. Gain 3 VP per space Wealth marker moves right.
- **State**: Sum of two lowest Legitimacy tracks. Move all Legitimacy to half (rounded up), then +1 per Legitimacy Token. 1 VP per matching Political Agenda Policy.

**End-Game Scoring**:
- **Working Class**: 1 VP per 10¥ remaining; VP based on number of Policies in section A (Socialist).
- **Middle Class**: 1 VP per 15¥; 1 VP per 2 Food or 3 of other stored resources; VP based on Policies in section B.
- **Capitalist Class**: -5 VP per Loan; 1 VP per 2 Food or 3 of other stored resources; VP based on Policies in section C (Neoliberal).
- **State**: 1 VP per 30¥ in Treasury; 1 VP per 2 Food or 3 of other Media Influence stored.

**Tiebreaker**: Compare number of Policies in preferred section (Working: A, Middle: B, Capitalist: C, State: matching Political Agenda). If still tied and State is among them, State wins. Else, most Voting cubes. Else, shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **IMF Intervention**: Triggered in Production if State Loans ≥ limit from Fiscal Policy and cannot pay 55¥ per Loan. Discard all Bills (each player gains 1 Influence per discarded Bill). Change Policies: Fiscal → C, Labor Market → A, Taxation → A, Welfare Health → A, Welfare Education → A, Foreign Trade → A. Apply changes (e.g., sell Public Companies, lower wages). State pays off Loans with available money. Move Legitimacy to half (rounded up).
- **Strike**: Place on up to 2 Companies with non-committed Workers and Wage <3. In Production, skip production (no Wage, no goods), gain 1 Influence, discard token. Middle Class: only skip employee's bonus production.
- **Demonstration**: Available if unemployed Workers > available slots by ≥2. Place token. If unresolved in Production, gain 1 Influence; others lose VP total = unemployed Workers + Trade Unions (max per player = their empty Company slots).
- **Trade Unions**: Assign skilled Worker to board slot. Requires ≥4 other Workers in that industry. Provides 1 Influence (Production) and 2 VP (Scoring). Dismantled if <4 Workers in industry.
- **Cooperative Farm**: Working Class card effect. Build with 3 unemployed unskilled Workers. Produces 2 Food in Production. Workers committed initially.
- **Free Trade Zone**: Capitalist-only. Store Food/Luxury. Avoid tariffs. Sell only to Foreign Market.
- **Voting Bag Empty**: Refill twice (no State Influence) then draw.
- **Immediate Vote**: Spend 1 Influence after Proposing Bill to trigger Election immediately.
