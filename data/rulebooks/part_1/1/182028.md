     - Military hand limit = number of Military Actions (face down)  
   - Resolve production, consumption, corruption, happiness  
   - Check for uprisings (if discontent workers exist)

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Row Management**:  
  - Cannot take more Civil cards than Civil Actions allow  
  - Action cards cannot be played on the turn they are taken  
  - Wonders cost 1 additional Civil Action per completed Wonder  
  - Only one Wonder can be under construction at a time  
  - Rotate Wonder sideways during construction; upright when complete  

- **Technologies**:  
  - Libraries: Produce Culture and Science equal to Age (I=1, II=2, III=3)  
  - Theatres: Produce 1 Happy Face + Culture equal to Age +1  
  - Arenas: Produce 2/3/4 Happy Faces + 1/2/3 Strength (I/II/III)  
  - Special Technologies: Immediate effect; later card replaces earlier of same type  
  - Leaders: Only one per Age may be taken; replacing a leader returns the Civil Action  

- **Military System**:  
  - Unit Strengths:  
    - Infantry: Base unit  
    - Cavalry: I-Knights (2), II-Cavalrymen (3), III-Tanks (5)  
    - Artillery: II-Cannon (3), III-Rockets (5)  
    - Air Force: III-Air Force (5); doubles strength of best army  
  - Armies: Match current Tactic card in type and number  
  - Outdated Units: If unit is 2 or more Ages below Tactic card Age, use lower bracketed value  
  - Exclusive Tactic: Held for one turn; next turn must be placed on Military Board and can be copied by others for 2 Military Actions  

- **Colonies**:  
  - No limit on number held  
  - Winning bid requires at least one military unit sacrificed (returned to Yellow Bank)  
  - Upper effect: Immediate (not reversed if colony lost)  
  - Lower effect: Permanent (reversed if colony lost)  

- **Pacts**:  
  - Only one Pact active at a time  
  - Can propose, accept, or cancel during Political Phase  

- **End of Age**:  
  - Advance to next Age deck  
  - Discard cards from Age two prior (e.g., Age I discarded at start of Age III)  
  - Remove antiquated Leaders, unfinished Wonders, Pacts  
  - Each player loses 2 yellow cubes  
  - If Age ends during first player’s turn, it’s the last round; otherwise, one more full round  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Final scoring occurs at end of Age IV:  
- 1 culture per Age I technology

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play an Action card the turn I draw it?**  
  No. Action cards cannot be played on the turn they are taken.

  No. Only one card per icon may be in play; newer replaces older.

  If any unit in an army is 2 or more Ages below the Tactic card Age, use the lower strength value on the Tactic card.

  Yes, but at the end of your turn, you must discard down to your Military Action count.

  Lose 4 Culture points per unpaid unit.
