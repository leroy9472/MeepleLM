## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Develop a civilization using one of 12 unique factions, each tied to a specific native terrain. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) after 6 rounds by expanding your territory, advancing in disciplines, building cities, and leveraging faction-specific powers.

### 2. Components  
- Main game board (with sides for 2, 3, or 4–5 players)  
- 14 faction boards (each with native terrain)  
- 7 planning display cards  
- 17 palace tiles (including red-backed #17 for solo/automa)  
- 12 competency tiles  
- 18 innovation tiles (number varies by player count)  
- Round score tiles (6 standard, 1 final round cover)  
- Round bonus tiles  
- Book action tiles (3 per game)  
- Science display with 4 discipline tracks  
- Turn order display  
- Resources: coins, tools, books, scholars, power tokens  
- Buildings: workshops, guilds, schools, universities, palaces, neutral buildings (towers, annexes, monument)  
- Spades (terraforming units)  
- Automa components (in solo mode): decision cards, faction cards, terrain priority cards, etc.

### 3. Setup  
**General Setup (2–5 players):**  
1. Choose board side based on player count. Use extension for 4–5 players.  
2. Randomly select 6 round score tiles. The tile with spades on the left cannot be used in rounds 5 or 6.  
3. Cover right side of round 6 score tile with a final round scoring tile of different building type.  
4. Place 3 random book action tiles on the board.  
5. Set up innovation display: place random innovation tiles on top row, competency tiles (red ribbon) on bottom.  
6. Place palace tiles: 1 red-backed (#17) + (1 + player count) random palace tiles face-up.  
7. Place science display and set all player markers at 0 on each of the 4 discipline tracks.  
8. Place turn order markers: start player on top of first column.  
9. Drafting phase:  
   - Lay out 7 planning display cards, each with 1 random round bonus tile and 1 random faction tile.  
   - Players draft in reverse order (last player chooses first), selecting one full set (planning display, faction, bonus tile).  
10. Place initial workshops:  
   - First, each player places one workshop on their native terrain.  
   - Then, starting with last player, each places a second workshop.  
11. Give starting resources and advance science markers per faction/planning display bonuses.

**Solo (Automa) Setup:**  
- Use 2-player setup with Automa.  
- Lay out 3 planning display cards, each with 2 random faction tiles.  
- Choose one set; Automa uses remaining factions. Assign Automa a native terrain and corresponding Automa Terrain Priority (ATP) card.  
- Place 5 round bonus tiles; give first to Automa, choose one for yourself, place 1 coin on each of the remaining 3.  
- Automa starts with turn order marker in second position.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has 3 phases:  
**Phase 1: Income**  
All players simultaneously gain resources shown on:  
- Faction board  
- Palace tile  
- Innovation tiles  
- Competency tiles  
- Round bonus tile  
- Discipline levels (if applicable)

**Phase 2: Actions**  
Players take turns in turn order, each taking **one action per turn** until all pass.  
Available actions:  
1. **Terraform & Build**:  
   - Terraform 1 space toward your native terrain (using spades).  
   - Must be within reach (adjacent or within sailing distance).  
   - Immediately build a workshop on the terraformed space.  
   - Excess spades may terraform additional spaces (no building).  
2. **Upgrade Building**:  
   - Upgrade any of your buildings (workshop → guild → school → university → palace).  
   - Guild upgrade gets discount if adjacent to opponent.  
   - Upgrading to school or university grants a competency tile.  
3. **Increase Sailing**: Pay cost to increase sailing value (extends reach over water).  
4. **Upgrade Terraforming**: Pay cost to reduce spades needed per terraform.  
5. **Develop Innovation**: Spend books (and 5 extra coins if palace unbuilt) to take an innovation tile.  
   - 1st: base cost  
   - 2nd: +1 book  
   - 3rd: +2 books  
   - Max 3 innovations per player.  
6. **Send Scholar**: Pay to send 1–3 scholars to science display, advancing on one discipline track.  
7. **Take Power Action**: Use an unclaimed power action (orange octagon).  
8. **Take Book Action**: Use an unclaimed book action.  
9. **Special Action**: Use one-time ability from faction, innovation, bonus tile, or competency tile (once per round).  
10. **Pass**:  
   - Return current round bonus tile.  
   - Choose a new one for next round.  
   - Place turn order marker on next round’s column.  
   - May gain VPs from "passing" effects (e.g., sealed envelope).

**Phase 3: Science Bonuses & Prep for Next Round**  
- Gain science bonus (if any) from round score tile.  
- Remove X-tokens from all orange octagonal action spaces.  
- Add 1 coin to each of the 3 unused round bonus tiles.  
- Flip next round score tile.  
- Flip new round bonus tiles (if applicable).

### 5. Core Mechanics  
**Resources & Conversion:**  
- **Coin**: Base currency.  
- **Tools**: Convert to coin (1:1). Used for terraforming and building.  
- **Books**: Convert to coin (1:1). Used for innovations.  
- **Scholars**: Convert to tools (1:1). Used for science advancement.  
- **Power**: Stored in 3 bowls.  
  - Gained via:  
    - Income  
    - Passing power thresholds on discipline tracks (requires key past level 7; only one player at level 12)  
    - Specific city/palace tiles  
    - Psychics faction ability  
    - Round score tiles  
    - Opponent building adjacent to your buildings (total power value of adjacent buildings; lose VP = total gained – 1)  
  - **Cycling Power**:  
    - Bowl 1 → Bowl 2  
    - If Bowl 1 empty: Bowl 2 → Bowl 3  
    - Exception: Remove 1 power from Bowl 2 (permanently) to move 1 from Bowl 2 to Bowl 3 (unlimited uses)  
  - **Spending Power**: Move from Bowl 3 to Bowl 1 during your turn to convert:  
    - 5 power → 1 scholar or 1 book  
    - 3 power → 1 tool  
    - 1 power → 1 coin  

**City Founding (Automatic):**  
Triggered when:  
- At least 4 directly adjacent buildings of same faction, **OR**  
  - 3 adjacent if one is a university  
  - 2 adjacent if one is a monument  
- Total power value of adjacent buildings ≥ 7 (or ≥ 6 with specific palace)  
- Annexes count as +1 building and +1 power  
Upon founding: choose 1 of 7 city tiles (grants key, one-time reward, 4–8 VP)

**Adjacency & Reach:**  
- **Adjacency**: Directly adjacent hexes or connected by bridge  
- **Reach**: Within adjacency + sailing value (determines terraforming/building range)

**Neutral Buildings:**  
- White towers: placed immediately when acquired; can terraform while placing  
- Purple annexes: placed one at a time later; increase building power and count toward city founding  
- Neutral university: does not grant competency tile

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after round 6. Final scoring includes:  
1. **Round Score Tiles**: VPs for terraforming, building, founding cities, advancing disciplines, etc.  
2. **Round Bonus Tiles**: VPs for riverside workshops, guilds, sending scholars  
3. **Palace Tile**: VPs for workshops, guilds, downgrading schools, taking flight  
4. **Competency Tiles**: VPs for border workshops, sending scholars  
5. **Faction Abilities**: Specific VP triggers (e.g., Illusionists gain VP for power actions)  
6. **City Founding**: Direct VP from city tiles  
7. **Sailing & Terraforming Upgrades**: Ongoing VP  
8. **Innovation & Competency Tiles**: Specific VP conditions  
9. **Passing Bonuses**: VP for passing with certain tiles  
10. **Endgame Bonuses**:  
   - Top 3 on each discipline track: 1st (4 VP), 2nd (2 VP), 3rd (1 VP)  
   - Largest connected building groups: 1st (4 VP), 2nd (2 VP), 3rd (1 VP)  
   - Leftover resources: 1 VP per 5 coins (after converting all resources to coin)  

Most VPs wins. Tiebreaker: highest position on science track.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I convert resources during another player’s turn?**  
  Yes. Resource conversion is not an action and can be done anytime.  
- **Do annexes trigger power gain when placed next to opponents?**  
  No. Only permanent buildings (not annexes) trigger opponent power gain.  
- **Can I build on partially terraformed land?**  
  No. Only fully terraformed land (to your native terrain) can support buildings.  
- **What if I can’t take all power from adjacent builds?**  
  Take as much as possible; still lose (total intended gain – 1) VP.  
- **Can I use spades from multiple sources in one action?**  
  Yes. Combine spades from terraforming track, book actions, power, etc.  
- **Do I get a competency tile for upgrading to neutral school?**  
  Yes. Only neutral university does not grant a competency.
