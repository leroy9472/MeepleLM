### 1. Lore & Objective
Twilight Imperium is a grand strategy board game set in a vast galaxy where players represent powerful space-faring factions vying for control. The ultimate goal is to achieve victory points (VPs) through political influence, technological dominance, military conquest, and economic strength. The first player to reach 10 victory points (or 14 in a longer game) wins immediately.

### 2. Components
- **Game Board**: Composed of system tiles forming a galaxy with Mecatol Rex at the center.
- **Faction Sheets**: Unique abilities, starting units, and technology for each of the playable factions.
- **Units**: Ships (Fighters, Destroyers, Cruisers, Dreadnoughts, War Suns, Flagships), Ground Forces (Infantry, Mechs), and Structures (PDS, Space Docks).
- **Command Tokens**: Used for actions, fleet limits, and strategy card abilities. Distributed across Tactic, Fleet, and Strategy pools.
- **Strategy Cards**: 8 types (Leadership, Diplomacy, Politics, Construction, Trade, Warfare, Technology, Imperial) that determine initiative and provide abilities.
- **Objective Cards**: Public (Stage I, Stage II) and Secret objectives that provide victory points.
- **Technology Cards**: Divided into four colors—Biotic (Green), Warfare (Red), Propulsion (Blue), Cybernetic (Yellow)—and Unit Upgrades.
- **Action Cards**: One-time use cards with various effects.
- **Agenda Cards**: Political decisions voted on after Mecatol Rex is claimed.
- **Promissory Notes**: Special one-time use abilities, including faction-specific ones.
- **Planet Cards**: Represent planets with Resource, Influence, and Technology Specialty values.
- **Trade Goods & Commodities**: Economic resources used for transactions and spending.
- **Exploration & Relic Decks**: Cards drawn when gaining control of planets or frontier tokens.

### 3. Setup
1. **Determine Speaker**: Randomly select the starting player who receives the Speaker token.
2. **Choose Factions**: Each player selects a faction and takes corresponding components (faction sheet, home system, units, tokens, tech deck, promissory notes).
3. **Build the Galaxy**:
   - Place Mecatol Rex in the center with the Custodians token.
   - Players place home systems equidistant on the outer ring.
   - Deal and place system tiles in rings from inner to outer, ensuring anomalies and wormholes follow adjacency rules.
4. **Prepare Common Areas**:
   - Shuffle and place decks (Action, Agenda, Exploration, Relic, Objective).
   - Place Strategy Cards face up with 1 Trade Good on unchosen cards each round.
5. **Player Setup**:
   - Place starting units in home system.
   - Gain starting technologies.
   - Place 3 Command Tokens in Tactic Pool, 3 in Fleet Pool, 2 in Strategy Pool.
   - Draw 2 Secret Objectives, choose 1 to keep.
   - Reveal first 2 Stage I Public Objectives.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game round consists of four phases:

**1. Strategy Phase**
- Starting with the Speaker, players choose 1 Strategy Card clockwise.
- In 3–4 player games, each player chooses a second card.
- Unchosen cards receive 1 Trade Good.
- Initiative order is determined by the lowest number on selected Strategy Card(s).

**2. Action Phase**
Players take turns in initiative order, repeating until all pass. Actions include:
- **Strategic Action**: Use primary ability of your Strategy Card; others may use secondary.
- **Tactical Action**: Spend a Tactic Pool token to activate a system and perform:
  - **Activation**: Place command token in a system without your existing token.
  - **Movement**: Move ships into the activated system, following movement rules and anomalies.
  - **Space Cannon Offense**: All players may fire Space Cannon abilities.
  - **Space Combat**: Mandatory if opposing ships present; resolve rounds including Anti-Fighter Barrage, combat rolls, hit assignment, and retreat.
  - **Invasion**: Bombard, commit ground forces, resolve Space Cannon Defense, then Ground Combat.
  - **Production**: Use Production-capable units to build new units by spending resources.
- **Component Action**: Use an ability labeled "Action" from cards, tech, or faction sheet.
- **Pass**: After using all Strategy Cards, a player may pass but can still resolve secondaries and transactions.

**3. Status Phase**
In initiative order:
1. Score up to 1 Public and 1 Secret Objective.
2. Speaker reveals next unrevealed Public Objective.
3. Each player draws 1 Action Card.
4. Remove all Command Tokens from the board.
5. Gain 2 Command Tokens and redistribute among pools.
6. Ready all exhausted cards (planets, tech, strategy).
7. Repair all Sustain Damage units.
8. Return Strategy Cards to the common area.

**4. Agenda Phase** *(Only after Custodians token is removed from Mecatol Rex)*
- **First Agenda**:
  1. Speaker reveals an Agenda card.
  2. Players vote clockwise starting left of Speaker; may negotiate transactions.
  3. Resolve outcome with Speaker breaking ties.
- **Second Agenda**: Repeat first agenda steps.
- **Ready Planets**: All players ready exhausted planet cards.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Command Tokens**:
  - **Tactic Pool**: Limits number of Tactical Actions.
  - **Fleet Pool**: Limits non-fighter ships per system.
  - **Strategy Pool**: Required to use secondary abilities of Strategy Cards.
- **Movement**:
  - Systems are adjacent if tiles touch or share matching wormholes.
  - Ships cannot move through enemy ships (except fighters).
  - Cannot move from a system with your command token.
  - Anomalies affect movement: Nebula (+1 defense, exit move=1), Gravity Rift (+1 move, 50% chance of destruction), Asteroid Field/Supernova (impassable).
- **Combat**:
  - **Space Combat**: Mandatory if opposing ships present. Defender applies +1 in Nebula. Anti-Fighter Barrage first, then combat rounds.
  - **Ground Combat**: No retreat. Active player chooses order if multiple planets.
  - **Bombardment**: Before committing ground forces; negated by Planetary Shield.
  - **Space Cannon**: Can fire during Movement step or as defense during invasion.
  - **Sustain Damage**: Cancel one hit per use; repaired during Status Phase.
- **Production**:
  - Only in activated system.
  - Production value is max units produced; cost paid via resources or Trade Goods.
  - Blockaded units (enemy ships present, no friendly ships) cannot produce ships but can produce ground forces.
- **Transactions & Deals**:
  - Active player may make one transaction per neighbor per turn.
  - Trade Goods, Commodities, Relic Fragments, and one Promissory Note may be exchanged.
  - Deals are binding only if resolvable immediately.
- **Technology**:
  - Research via Technology Strategy Card (primary: 6 resources, secondary: 4 resources + Strategy Token).
  - Prerequisites must be met using owned tech or exhausting matching planet specialty.
  - Unit Upgrades do not satisfy prerequisites.
- **Capturing Units**:
  - Non-fighter ships and Mechs captured are placed on capturer’s faction sheet.
  - Returned via transaction, ability, or blockade of capturer’s Space Dock.
  - Fighters and Infantry captured use tokens and return to supply when released.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Points**:
  - **Public Objectives**: Scored in Status Phase if requirements met and control all home system planets.

  - **Custodians Token**: First player to remove it gains 1 VP.
  - **Mecatol Rex Control**: Gain 1 VP via Imperial Strategy Card.
