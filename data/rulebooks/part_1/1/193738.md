### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Great Western Trail*, players take on the role of ranchers in 19th-century America, herding cattle from Texas to Kansas City and shipping them by rail to distant cities. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VP) through strategic use of buildings, workers, cattle, and railroads. Victory points are scored at the end of the game via multiple avenues: buildings, stations, objective cards, hazard tiles, money, and end-game bonuses.

### 2. Components
- Game board
- 4 player boards
- 4 player count tiles (3/4 players side)
- 54 worker tiles (18 each: cowboy, craftsman, engineer)
- 18 hazard tiles (6 each: flood, drought, rockfall)
- 22 teepee tiles (11 each: blue, green)
- 4 cattlemen
- 4 engines
- 56 player discs (14 per player)
- 4 certificate markers
- 92 cattle cards:
  - 56 player cattle cards (14 per player: Jersey, Dutch Belt, Black Angus, Guernsey)
  - 36 market cattle cards (Holstein, Brown Swiss, Ayrshire, West Highland, Texas Longhorn)
- 24 objective cards
- 4 starting objective cards
- 47 building tiles:
  - 7 neutral building tiles (A–G)
  - 40 private building tiles (10 per player, double-sided)
- 5 station master tiles
- 55 coins ($1 and $5)
- 1 job market token
- 1 scoring notepad
- 1 exchange token (per player, in expansions)

### 3. Setup
1. Place the game board in the center.
2. Randomly place one station master tile on each of the five station master spaces.
3. Place the 7 neutral building tiles on their designated spaces (A–G or randomly).
4. Place the job market token on the top dashed space of the job market.
5. Sort worker, hazard, and teepee tiles by the number on the back (①, ②, ③), shuffle each pile, and place them as the Kansas City supply.
6. Reveal 7 tiles from pile ① and place:
   - Teepee tiles in the Indian Trade section (lowest $ first)
   - Hazard tiles in their respective sections (lowest number first)
   - Return any that can’t be placed to the box.
7. Reveal tiles from pile ② and place worker tiles in the job market, starting beneath the player count indicator, filling left to right. Stop just before the job market token.
8. Fill the 6 foresight spaces in Kansas City: 2 from each of ①, ②, ③.
9. Shuffle the 36 market cattle cards and draw 7 (2p), 10 (3p), or 13 (4p) to form the cattle market, sorted by color.
10. Shuffle the 24 objective cards, place face down, and reveal 4 face up (general objective display).
11. Each player:
    - Chooses a color and takes matching player board, discs, engine, cattleman, certificate marker, and 10 private building tiles.
    - Uses the same side (all 'a' or all 'b') of building tiles; determined randomly or by agreement.
    - Places discs on all 14 disc spaces of the player board.
    - Places engine on the starting space (red building).
    - Places certificate marker on the "0" space.
    - Takes 14 player cattle cards (with star), shuffles into a personal deck, draws 4 to hand.
    - Receives a player count tile (3p/4p only), places it to cover Phase A.
    - Draws one starting objective card (randomly dealt), places it in personal objective area.
    - Starting player receives $6, next $7, then $8, then $9.
    - On first turn, place cattleman on any neutral building tile.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of three phases:
1. **Phase A: Move Cattleman**
   - Move at least 1 step, up to step limit (3 for 2–3p, 4 for 4p).
   - Each tile (building, hazard, teepee) is a location (1 step). Empty spaces are not.
   - Movement is forward only, following arrows; forks allow choice.
   - Cannot pass through Kansas City; must stop there.
   - Pay tolls when moving to or passing over locations with green/black hands:
     - Hazard/teepee: pay bank.
     - Opponent’s building: pay owner.
     - Amount depends on player count.
     - If unable to pay, pay what you can and continue.
2. **Phase B: Use Location Action(s)**
   - **On neutral or own building tile:**
     - Perform any or all local actions (in any order, once each), or
     - Perform one single auxiliary action.
   - **On opponent’s building, hazard, or teepee tile:**
     - Perform one single auxiliary action only.
   - **On Kansas City:**
     - Perform 5 subphases in order:
       1. **Foresight 1:** Choose one of two ① tiles, place it on the board (teepee, hazard, or job market). If placing a worker, move job market token down; if crossing yellow arrow, refill cattle market.
       2. **Foresight 2:** Same with ② tiles.
       3. **Foresight 3:** Same with ③ tiles.
       4. **Income:** Reveal entire hand. Total breeding value = sum of highest value of each cattle type. Optionally add temporary (move marker back) or permanent (from station master) certificates. Gain $ equal to total. Discard entire hand.
       5. **Delivery:** Choose city with value ≤ income. Cannot deliver to a city you’ve already delivered to (except Kansas City or San Francisco). Place one of your discs from player board onto city space:
          - White-corner disc → any city.
          - Black-corner disc → black-corner city only (unless no white discs left).
          - Pay transport cost: $1 per cross between your engine and city.
          - Trigger delivery actions if both adjacent cities have your discs.
          - Move cattleman back to start.
          - Refill foresight spaces.
3. **Phase C: Draw Up to Hand Limit**
   - Draw cards to reach hand limit (starts at 4, can increase to 6).
   - If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Worker Hiring:** Pay cost (modified by action) to hire from job market. Cannot hire from row with job market token. Immediate actions trigger if space has one.
- **Building Placement:** Place on empty space or upgrade existing building. Must have enough craftsmen. Cost: $2 per craftsman required (or difference when upgrading).
- **Engine Movement:** Move forward up to number of engineers. Skip occupied spaces. At turnout, may upgrade station by paying cost and placing disc.
- **Station Upgrades:** Pay cost, place disc, optionally take station master tile by replacing it with rightmost worker from any row.
- **Objective Cards:** Gain by action or foresight. Play from hand before Phase A or before/after any action in Phase B. Immediate action triggers; must fulfill tasks by game end or suffer penalty.
- **Auxiliary Actions:** Unlock by clearing disc spaces. Single or double (if both disc spaces cleared). Includes:
  - Gain $1 or $2
  - Draw/discard 1 or 2 cards
  - Move engine back 1 or 2 spaces, advance certificate marker
  - Move engine forward 1 or 2 spaces
  - Move engine back, trash 1 or 2 cards
- **Cattle Market:** Buy based on number of cowboys. Unused cowboys can add 2 market cards each.
- **Hazard Removal:** Pay cost to take hazard tile (worth VP at end).
- **Indian Trade:** Pay or gain money to take teepee tile (used for VP and objectives).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End:** Triggered when job market token moves off the bottom of the job market during a Kansas City visit. That player takes the token (worth 2 VP). All other players get one final turn.
- **Final Scoring (11 categories):**
  1. $5 → 1 VP
  2. Sum of VP on placed private building tiles
  3. Sum of VP from city crests and connections (green arrows only when both adjacent cities have your disc)
  4. Sum of VP from train stations with your disc
  5. Sum of VP on collected hazard tiles
  6. Sum of VP on cattle cards in deck (draw pile, hand, discard)
  7. Objective cards:
     - Played: score if all tasks fulfilled (+VP), else -VP
     - Unplayed: choose at end to score or remove from game (no penalty)
     - No double-dipping: each component used for only one objective
  8. Station master tile bonuses:
     - 1 VP per worker (including starting ones)
     - 3 VP per 2 objective cards (played)
     - 3 VP per 2 hazard tiles
     - 3 VP per green+blue teepee pair
     - 3 VP per 2 certificates (temp + perm)
  9. 4 VP per worker on 5th or 6th space of any worker row
  10. 3 VP for clearing the final step limit disc
  11. 2 VP for having the job market token
- Highest total VP wins. Tie: shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hand Fees:** If you can’t pay, pay what you can. Movement continues.
- **Disc Placement:** If no white-corner discs left, may use black-corner disc on white-corner city.
- **Engine Movement Backward:** Must move full required distance; can end on turnout and upgrade.
- **Double Auxiliary Action:** Can only be taken via specific action (e.g., on a building), not when using single auxiliary option.
- **Station Master Tile:** Can only be taken at moment of station upgrade.
- **Objective Cards:** Tasks cannot be shared between cards. Each must be fulfilled separately.
- **Deck Size:** Can be reduced to zero via trashing; play with fewer cards if needed.
- **Cattle Market Refill:** Only if below player count threshold and cards remain in stack.
