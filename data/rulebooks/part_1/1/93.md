## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In El Grande, players are Spanish nobles (Grandes) vying for influence across Renaissance-era Spain as the king’s health declines. The objective is to gain the most victory points by controlling regions through strategic placement of Caballeros (knights). The game ends after 9 rounds (or 6 in the short game), and the player with the highest score wins.

2. Components  
- Game board showing 9 regions (e.g., Galicia, Castilla, Granada) and round/scoring tracks  
- 1 King token (black pawn)  
- 1 Castillo (fortress that holds Caballeros)  
- 5 Grande pieces (large cubes, one per player color)  
- 50 Caballeros (small cubes: 10 per player)  
- 5 sets of 13 Power Cards (numbered 1–13, unique per player)  
- 55 Action Cards, sorted into 5 stacks by caballero symbol count (1–5)  
  - Stack 5 contains only the “Your Majesty” (King) card  
- 5 Secret Disks (one per player)  
- 1 Round Marker  
- 2 Mobile Scoreboards (used to modify region scoring)  
- 5 Player Score Markers  

3. Setup  
- Place the board with the appropriate side (2–3 or 4–5 players).  
- Place the Castillo on its board space.  
- Shuffle the 9 Region Cards. Reveal the top card and place the King in that region (King’s Region).  
- Deal one Region Card to each player to determine their Home Region. Players place their Grande and 2 Caballeros in this region. Return all Region Cards to the box.  
- Each player:  
  - Places 7 Caballeros in their Court (in front of them).  
  - Places 1 Caballero on the 0 space of the scoring track (used as score marker).  
  - Takes their 13 Power Cards and Secret Disk.  
- Remaining 21 Caballeros form the Province (reserve pool).  
- Sort Action Cards into 5 stacks by back symbol (1–5 caballeros), shuffle each, and place face-down beside the board.  
- Place the Round Marker on space 1 (or space 2 for the short game).  
- Randomly select the first player and give them the First Player Marker.

4. Gameplay Flow  
A round proceeds in the following steps:  
A. Advance the Round Marker. If it lands on a lily (rounds 3, 6, 9), trigger scoring after the round.  
B. Reveal the top card of each of the 5 Action Card stacks.  
C. Power Card Play:  
   - Starting with the player who went last in the previous round (or random first player in round 1), players take turns playing one Power Card face-up.  
   - No duplicate numbers may be played in the same round.  
D. Player Turns (in order from highest to lowest Power Card value):  
   1) Move up to the number of Caballeros shown on the Power Card from the Province to the Court.  
      - If the Province lacks enough Caballeros, players may move Caballeros from regions on the board (but not from the Castillo) to their Court.  
   2) Choose one of the 5 face-up Action Cards.  
   3/4) Perform the following in either order:  
      - Move up to the number of Caballeros shown on the Action Card from Court to the board.  
        - Valid locations: regions adjacent to the King’s Region or the Castillo.  
        - Cannot place in the King’s Region.  
        - May split Caballeros among multiple valid regions.  
      - Execute the special action on the card (optional). If executed, perform as much as possible unless "up to" is specified.  
   5) Discard the Action Card (except the King card, which returns face-down to its stack).  
E. End of Round:  
   - Discard any unchosen Action Cards from stacks 1–4.  
   - Replace the King card (stack 5) face-up.  
   - Discard all played Power Cards.  
   - The player who played the lowest Power Card becomes the First Player for the next round.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Power Cards: Determine turn order (high to low) and number of Caballeros drawn (0–6). Each card used once per game.  
- Action Cards: Allow placement of 1–5 Caballeros and a special action (e.g., move Grande, score a region early).  
- King’s Region:  
  - No Caballeros, Grande, or scoring tiles may enter or leave unless an action explicitly allows it.  
  - Adjacent regions are valid for placement.  
- Castillo:  
  - Not a region. Caballeros placed here are scored during general scoring.  
  - Before scoring, players secretly choose where their Castillo Caballeros will go using Secret Disks (King’s Region cannot be chosen).  
- Secret Disks: Used during scoring to redirect Castillo Caballeros.  
- Scoring Tiles: Can be placed in regions (one per region) to replace default scoring values.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Scoring occurs after rounds 3, 6, and 9.  
Sequence:  
1) Each player secretly selects a region on their Secret Disk (King’s Region not allowed).  
2) Open the Castillo: Score Caballeros inside as a region:  
   - 1st: 5 VP, 2nd: 3 VP, 3rd: 1 VP. Ties score the lower rank.  
3) Reveal Secret Disks. Move each player’s Castillo Caballeros to their chosen region.  
   - If King’s Region was chosen (illegal), return Caballeros to player’s Court.  
4) Score all 9 regions in order (top to bottom on board):  
   - Use scoring values in region (e.g., 7/4/2).  
   - Only 1st place scored in 2-player; 1st and 2nd in 3-player.  
   - Count Caballeros only (not Grande).  
   - Ties: all tied players receive the lower rank’s points.  
   - Bonuses (only if sole majority):  
     - +2 VP for controlling King’s Region.  
     - +2 VP for controlling Home Region.  
     - Bonuses stack if both conditions met.  
Game ends after 3rd scoring. Highest score wins. Ties are shared.
