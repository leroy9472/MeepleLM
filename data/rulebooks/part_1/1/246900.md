# Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Eclipse is a 4X space strategy game set in a galaxy recovering from the Terran-Hegemony War. Seven major species compete for dominance through exploration, technological advancement, economic development, and military conquest. The game lasts 8 rounds. Victory is determined by Victory Points (VP), earned through controlling sectors, researching technologies, building structures, forming diplomatic relations, winning battles, and completing species-specific objectives.

Place Starting Sectors in the Starting Zone closest to each player. Fill remaining Starting Zones with random Guardian Sectors (not in 6-player games), each with a Discovery Tile and a Guardian miniature.
- **Player Setup:**
  - Choose a Species Board and matching Species Tray.
  - Place Starting Sector adjacent to the Galactic Center.
  - Place 1 Interceptor (Orions get 1 Cruiser) on the Starting Sector.
  - Place 1 Influence Disc on the Starting Sector's Influence Space.
  - Place 1 Population Cube on each non-starred planet (Hydrans place one on an Advanced Science square).
  - Place all Colony Ships on the Species Board.
  - Place Influence Discs on the Influence Track (leave 3 in the tray, 5 for Eridani).
  - Place Storage Markers on the Storage Track at starting values.
  - Place Population Cubes on the Population Tracks at values 3-28.
- **Tech Tray Setup:** Draw the required number of regular Tech Tiles (Military, Grid, Nano) and place them in the Tech Tray. Place any Rare Tech Tiles drawn in the bottom row slots. Shuffle the Discovery Tiles and place them facedown near the Upgrade Tray.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the 8 rounds consists of four phases:
1.  **Action Phase:** Players take turns performing actions clockwise until all pass.
2.  **Combat Phase:** All battles are resolved.
3.  **Upkeep Phase:** Players pay upkeep and collect income.
4.  **Cleanup Phase:** The board is reset for the next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Actions (Action Phase):** Players spend Influence Discs from their track to perform actions.
  - **Explore:** Draw a sector tile from the stack corresponding to an adjacent zone. Place it if it connects via a wormhole (or Wormhole Generator tech). If placed, take any Discovery Tile (if undefended), place an Influence Disc (if no Ancients), and colonize planets using Colony Ships.
  - **Research:** Pay Science to take a Tech Tile from the Tech Tray and place it on your Species Board. The cost is reduced by the number of Techs you already have in that category (minimum cost applies).
  - **Upgrade:** Modify a Ship Blueprint by returning Ship Part Tiles to the tray and placing new ones from the tray. All ships of that type are instantly upgraded. Must have researched the required tech and not exceed energy production.
  - **Build:** Pay Materials to build one ship or structure in a sector you control. Starbases, Orbitals, and Monoliths require their respective techs. Only one Monolith and one Orbital per sector.
  - **Move:** Move one ship per activation up to its Movement Value (sum of Drives). Ships can only move through sectors connected by wormholes (or Warp Portals). Ships are pinned 1:1 by enemy ships or starbases, preventing movement.
  - **Influence:** Flip up to 2 Colony Ships. Then, for each activation, move an Influence Disc from your track or a sector you control to:
    - An uncontrolled sector adjacent to a sector you control or where you have a ship.
    - An uncontrolled sector where only you have a ship.
    - Back to the rightmost space on your Influence Track.
- **Passing:** The first player to pass gains 2 Money and the Start Player Tile for the next round. After passing, a player can only take Reactions (one Build, Upgrade, or Move activation per Influence Disc spent).
- **Diplomacy (4+ players):** Players with adjacent controlled sectors can form Diplomatic Relations by exchanging an Ambassador Tile and a Population Cube. This grants +1 VP and increases income. An "Act of Aggression" (ending an action with your ships in a sector the other controls or vice versa) breaks the relation. The aggressor takes the Traitor Tile (-2 VP).
- **Combat Phase:**
  - **Determine Battles:** Identify sectors with opposing ships.
  - **Resolve Battles:** In descending sector number order. For each sector:
    - Resolve battles between players in reverse order of entry. The player who entered last is the attacker.
    - Determine Initiative for each ship type (sum of Initiative symbols; defender wins ties).
    - Fire Missiles once, in Initiative order.
    - Conduct Engagement Rounds: In Initiative order, the active player chooses for their ship type to Attack or Retreat. If attacking, roll all dice for that type and assign hits to targets. A hit is scored if the die shows a burst (always a hit), or if (die roll + Computers - Shields) >= 6. Damage equals the number of bursts. A ship is destroyed when damage >= Hull value.
  - **Attack Population:** After battles, surviving ships attack population cubes. Each ship attacks once. If using Neutron Bombs (and enemy lacks Neutron Absorber), all population is destroyed automatically.
  - **Influence Sectors:** Players may place Influence Discs on uncontrolled sectors where they have ships (if no population remains).
  - **Discovery Tiles:** Players take Discovery Tiles from sectors they now control.
  - **Repair Damage:** Remove all Damage Cubes from surviving ships.
- **Upkeep Phase:**
  - Use any remaining Colony Ships to place population in sectors without enemy ships.
  - Collect Money Income (highest value on Money Population Track).
  - Pay Civilization Upkeep Cost (rightmost value on Influence Track). Pay by trading resources or abandoning sectors (returning Influence Discs and Population Cubes).
  - Collect Materials and Science Income (highest values on respective Population Tracks).
- **Cleanup Phase:**
  - Return all Influence Discs from the Action Track to the Influence Track.
  - Move all Population Cubes from Graveyards to their respective Population Tracks.
  - Flip all Colony Ships and Summary Tiles faceup.
  - Draw new Tech Tiles (number based on player count).
  - Advance the Round Marker.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends after the 8th round. Players score VP from:
- **Reputation Tiles:** 1-4 VP per tile (value on tile).
- **Ambassador Tiles:** 1 VP per tile.
- **Controlled Sectors:** VP value printed on the sector.
- **Monoliths:** 3 VP each (only if on a controlled sector).
- **Discovery Tiles (kept as VP):** 2 VP each.
- **Traitor Tile:** -2 VP.
- **Tech Track Progress:** 1 VP for 4 Techs, 2 VP for 5, 3 VP for 6, 5 VP for 7 in a single track.
- **Species Bonuses:**
  - Planta: +1 VP per controlled sector.
  - Descendants of Draco: +1 VP per Ancient ship on the board.
  - Eridani Empire: +1 VP per 3 VP in Reputation Tile value (Ancient Might).
  - Wardens of Magellan: +1 VP per Discovery Tile kept as a ship part.
  - Enlightened of Lyra: +1 VP per Shrine controlled.
  - The Exiles: +1 VP per Orbital controlled.
  - Artifact Key (Tech): +5 Resources per Artifact (♠) on controlled sectors.
  - Artifact Codex (Discovery): +1 VP per Artifact (♠) on controlled sectors.
- **Tiebreaker:** The player with the most total resources (Materials + Science + Money) wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Tech Tile Draw:** If more alien techs appear than there is space, place them in the nearest tech slot.
- **Lost Components:** Influence Discs are returned immediately after battles. Population Cubes are placed in the "graveyard" and returned during Cleanup.
- **Pinned Ships:** A ship is pinned if there is an equal number of enemy ships in the same sector. Unpinned ships can move through.
- **Discoveries:** Discoveries in sectors with NPCs (Ancients, Guardians) are earned after combat, not when first explored.
- **Retreat Penalty:** If all your ships attempt to retreat, you do not draw a Reputation Tile for participation (but still for ships destroyed).
- **Bankruptcy:** If you cannot pay your upkeep after trading and abandoning sectors, you are eliminated.
- **Stalemate:** If no player can destroy the other's ships, the attacker must retreat or be destroyed.
