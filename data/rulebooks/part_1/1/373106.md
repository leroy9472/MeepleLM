## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Sky Team*, players take on the roles of a pilot and co-pilot working together to safely land a commercial airliner at challenging airports around the world. Each scenario presents unique environmental and mechanical conditions—such as wind, fuel leaks, icy runways, or heavy air traffic—that require precise coordination and communication under pressure.

**Objective**: Successfully land the aircraft by meeting all endgame conditions, including correct speed, axis alignment, gear/flap deployment, and clearance of air traffic.

### 3. Setup  
#### Base Game Setup (e.g., YUL Montréal–Trudeau):  
1. Place Control Panel between players; sit side-by-side (Pilot on blue side, left).  
2. Align Airplane Axis disc so arrow points to top triangle (centered).  
3. Cover all 10 green lights with switches.  
4. Position Aerodynamics markers:  
   - Blue marker between 4 and 5  
   - Orange marker between 8 and 9  
5. Place red Brake marker just left of 2 on Brake track.  
6. Insert **Approach Track** into top-left slot, airport icon visible.  
7. Insert **Altitude Track** into top-right slot, showing 6000 ft.  
8. Place one Reroll token on each Reroll icon along Altitude Track.  
9. For each Traffic icon on Approach Track, place one Airplane token on that space.  
10. Place 3 Coffee tokens near board.  
11. Distribute:  
    - Pilot: 4 blue dice + blue screen  
    - Co-Pilot: 4 orange dice + orange screen  

#### Module Additions (if applicable):  
- **Kerosene Module**: Place Kerosene Track left of Control Panel; set marker to 20.  
- **Wind Module**: Place Wind Ring to right of Control Panel; center airplane token.  
- **Ice Brakes**: Cover original Brakes with Ice Brakes board.  
- **Intern Module**: Place Intern Board below Control Panel; place random Intern tokens face-up on each space.  
- **Kerosene Leak**: Place face-down Intern token on Kerosene die space (blocks use).  
- **Real-Time Mode**: Prepare 60-second timer.  

Select scenario from Flight Log booklet and apply its specific setup instructions.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts exactly **7 rounds**, descending from 6000 ft to 0 ft (runway). Each round proceeds as follows:

#### 1. Begin Round  
- Check Approach Track Current Position:  
  - **Traffic Icons?** → Roll Traffic die once per icon; add Airplane token to indicated space (1 = current, 6 = last space/airport).  
  - **Alarm Icon?** → Flip one random Alarm token face-up. Affected system is disabled until fixed.  
  - **Mute Icon?** → Skip strategy discussion phase.  

#### 2. Strategy Discussion  
- Players may discuss goals (“We need to slow down,” “Clear the first plane”) but **cannot** mention die values, placements, or specific numbers.  

#### 3. Dice Roll  
- Simultaneously roll all 4 dice behind screens.  
- **Real-Time Mode**: Start 60-second timer immediately.  

#### 4. Reroll Token  
- Remove Reroll token from current altitude space and return to supply.  
- At any time during the round, either player may spend a Reroll token to allow both players to reroll any number of their remaining dice **once**.  

#### 5. Dice Placement (Turn-Based)  
- The player whose color matches the arrow on the Altitude Track goes first.  
- Alternate placing **one die at a time** until all 8 dice are placed.  
- Rules:  
  - Only place on free spaces.  
  - Respect color constraints (blue/orange/both).  
  - Respect number constraints (e.g., Flaps 1/2 requires 1 or 2).  
  - **Mandatory**: Each round, both Axis and Engines must have one die of each color by end of round.  

##### Action Spaces:  
- **Axis**:  
  - After second die placed, compare values.  
  - If equal → no movement.  
  - If different → turn Axis Arrow toward higher die by difference in value.  
  - If arrow reaches or passes × → **SPIN**, immediate loss.  
- **Engines**:  
  - After second die placed, sum both dice.  
  - Compare total to Aerodynamics markers:  
    - < Blue → advance 0 spaces  
    - Between Blue and Orange → advance 1 space  
    - > Orange → advance 2 spaces  
  - **Wind Module Active?** → Add wind speed (from Wind Ring) to engine total.  
  - **Overshoot?** If airport is current position and you advance → **loss**.  
  - **Crash into traffic?** If advancing causes plane to pass over occupied space → **loss**.  
- **Radio**:  
  - Remove one Airplane token from space equal to die value (1 = current position).  
  - Pilot: 1 space | Co-Pilot: 2 spaces  
- **Landing Gear** (Pilot only):  
  - Deploy in any order.  
  - Slide switch to green.  
  - Advance blue Aerodynamics marker one space per deployment.  
- **Flaps** (Pilot only):  
  - Must deploy top to bottom (1/2 → 2/3 → 3/4 → 4/5).  
  - Slide switch to green.  
  - Advance orange Aerodynamics marker one space per deployment.  
- **Brakes**:  
  - Deploy in order: 2 → 4 → 6.  
  - Advance red Brake marker one space per deployment.  
  - **Ice Brakes Variant**:  
    - Must play matching dice above and below same number in same round.  
    - Marker advances only when pair is completed.  
    - Marker must exceed 5 by endgame.  
- **Concentration**:  
  - Any player, any die.  
  - Place Coffee token (max 3 on board).  
  - Coffee tokens can modify die values by ±1 (non-wrapping, 1–6 only).  
  - Any player may use any Coffee token at time of placement.  
- **Kerosene Action**:  
  - Pilot or Co-Pilot places die → move Kerosene marker down by die value.  
  - If no die placed here → lose 6 fuel at end of round.  
  - At 0 → **fuel exhaustion**, immediate loss.  
- **Kerosene Leak Variant**:  
  - Cannot use Kerosene action.  
  - Fuel loss = |Die1 – Die2| + 1 (based on Engines).  
- **Intern Training**:  
  - Place die on your color on Intern Board.  
  - Take closest token, place it like a die (cannot go on Concentration or be modified).  
  - Die value must differ from next available token.  
  - All tokens must be trained by landing, or **loss**.  

#### 6. End of Round  
1. **Optional Module Steps**:  
   - Kerosene: If no die on Kerosene space → lose 6 fuel. If at 0 → lose.  
2. **Decrease Altitude**:  
   - Advance Altitude Track one space (1000 ft).  
3. **Take Back Dice**.  
4. **Check Win/Loss Conditions**:  
   - If airport is in Current Position and altitude reaches 0 → proceed to Final Round.  
   - If airport reached too early → hold pattern (do not advance further).  
   - If altitude reaches 0 before airport → **crash**, immediate loss.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Cooperative Communication**: Limited discussion forces inference through actions.  
- **Turn-Based Dice Placement**: Alternating turns add tension and require predictive play.  
- **Shared Control**: Both players affect critical systems (Axis, Engines).  
- **Risk Management**: Balancing speed, fuel, traffic, and system failures.  
- **Time Pressure (Real-Time Mode)**: 60-second limit per round.  
- **Information Asymmetry**: Screens hide dice values; players must deduce intent.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Final Round Trigger:  
When Current Position = Airport **and** Current Altitude = Runway (0 ft).  

#### Final Round Rules:  
- Engine comparison now uses **Brake marker**, not Aerodynamics.  
- **Victory Condition**:  
  You win if **ALL** of the following are true:  
  1. No Airplane tokens remain on Approach Track.  
  2. Airplane Axis is centered (arrow pointing up).  
  3. All Landing Gear and Flap switches show green.  
  4. Brake marker > Engine total (after wind, if applicable).  
  5. (Ice Brakes) Brake marker > 5.  
  6. (Intern) All Intern tokens trained.  
  7. (Kerosene) Fuel > 0.  

Failure to meet any condition → **loss**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a die on a space with a green switch already lit?**  
  Yes, but no effect occurs.  

- **Can Coffee tokens be used on Intern tokens?**  
  No. Intern tokens cannot be modified.  

- **What if I can’t place all dice due to Real-Time mode?**  
  Round ends immediately. If Axis or Engines lack required dice → **loss**.  

- **Can I reroll after using a Coffee token?**  
  Yes — Coffee is spent at placement; rerolls happen before placement.  

- **Do Turbulence or Bad Visibility affect solo mode?**  
  Yes — if scenario includes them, apply normally.  

- **Can I train an Intern and use it the same turn?**  
  Yes — place die, take token, immediately use it.  

- **What happens if Wind Ring modifies speed past 12?**  
  Treat normally — still compare to Aerodynamics thresholds.  

- **Can I deploy Brakes out of order?**  
  No — must follow 2 → 4 → 6 sequence.  

- **If I pass a space with Traffic icon while advancing 2 spaces, do I roll?**  
  No — only roll if starting round on that space.  

- **Can I use multiple Coffee tokens on one die?**  
  Yes — up to 3, as long as final value stays within 1–6.
