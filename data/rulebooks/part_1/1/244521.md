# The Quacks of Quedlinburg — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In the city of Quedlinburg, quack doctors compete to brew the most potent potions during a 9-day bazaar. Players draw ingredient chips from their bags to fill their cauldrons (pots), aiming to reach high-value scoring spaces without causing an explosion. The goal is to accumulate the most victory points (VP) over 9 rounds by wisely managing risk, purchasing powerful ingredients, and leveraging special abilities from ingredient books.

### 2. Components
- 4 player pots (boards)  
- 1 scoring track with turn indicator  
- 1 flame marker (turn indicator)  
- 4 scoring markers  
- 4 droplets  
- 4 flasks  
- 4 rat stones  
- 4 bags  
- 20 rubies  
- 1 bonus die  
- 21b ingredient chips (various colors and values) + 3 replacement chips  
- 24 fortune teller cards  
- 12 ingredient books:  
  - 1 orange (pumpkin) – fixed  
  - 1 black (death’s head hawkmoth) – double-sided for player count  
  - 2 each of green (garden spider), blue (crow skull), red (toadstool), yellow (mandrake), purple (ghost’s breath) – grouped in sets (1–4)  

### 3. Setup
1. Place scoring track in center; flame on round 1.  
2. Place seal tiles on scoring track with "0" face up.  
3. Choose one set of ingredient books (e.g., Set 1 for beginners). Books are identified by number of bookmarks.  
4. Place orange and black books in play. Black book side depends on player count:  
   - 2-player: use side with 2 pots shown  
   - 3–4 players: use side with 3–4 pots shown  
5. Place green, blue, and red books from chosen set. Set yellow and purple books aside.  
6. Sort ingredient chips by color and place near corresponding books.  
7. Each player takes:  
   - 1 pot (use side without test tubes unless playing variant)  
   - 1 bag  
   - 1 scoring marker (on seal matching color)  
   - 1 droplet (on space 0 of pot)  
   - 1 rat stone (on small trivet)  
   - 1 flask (full side up on large trivet)  
   - 1 ruby (left of pot)  
8. Each player adds to their bag:  
   - 4 white 1-chips  
   - 2 white 2-chips  
   - 1 white 3-chip  
   - 1 orange 1-chip  
   - 1 green 1-chip  
9. Shuffle fortune teller deck; start player holds it.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of 9 rounds proceeds in phases:

#### A. Fortune Teller Card
- Start player draws and reads top card aloud.  
- Effects apply to all players.  
- Purple cards: immediate effect.  
- Blue cards: last entire turn or apply at end.  
- If card allows yellow/purple chip, only usable when those books are revealed (rounds 2 and 3).  
- Discard previous round’s blue card.

#### B. Rats (from round 2 onward)
- All non-leading players count rat tails between their score marker and the leader’s on the scoring track.  
- Move rat stone forward that many spaces from droplet (or current rat position).  
- Rat stone sets new starting point for chip placement this round.

#### C. Potions Phase (Simultaneous)
- All players draw chips from their bags one at a time.  
- Place first chip value spaces after droplet (or rat stone).  
- Subsequent chips go value spaces after last placed chip.  
- After each draw:
  - Resolve chip action (if blue, red, yellow — immediate)
  - Decide to stop or draw again
  - If white chip drawn and flask is full, may return it to bag (cannot prevent explosion)
- **Explosion**: If total value of white chips > 7, pot explodes. Place last chip, stop drawing.
- Players who stop or explode place bag on table.
- In round 9, players may draw simultaneously (on command like “Stir!”).

#### D. Evaluation Phase
1. **Scoring Space**: The space immediately after the last chip placed.
2. **A) Bonus Die**:  
   - Player(s) with highest scoring space who did not explode roll bonus die.  
   - If tie, all tied players roll.  
   - Outcomes: 1 VP, 2 VP, 1 ruby, move droplet 1 space, or add orange 1-chip to bag.
3. **B) Chip Actions**:  
   - In turn order, resolve effects of black, green, purple chips (evaluated after drawing).  
   - See ingredient books for effects.
4. **C) Rubies**:  
   - If scoring space has ruby icon, take 1 ruby (even if exploded).
5. **D) Victory Points (if not exploded)**:  
   - Take VP shown in beige square of scoring space.  
   - If on space 33, take 15 VP (from spoon).
6. **E) Buy Chips (if not exploded)**:  
   - Use green number (coins) from scoring space.  
   - Buy 1 or 2 chips of different colors.  
   - Cannot exceed supply.  
   - Costs from ingredient books.  
   - Leftover coins lost.
7. **F) End of Turn**:  
   - Spend 2 rubies to:  
     - Move droplet 1 space forward (permanent)  
     - Refill flask (flip to full side)  
   - May do either or both, multiple times if rubies allow.
8. **Clean-up**:  
   - Return all chips (drawn + purchased) to bag.  
   - Return rat stone to trivet.  
   - Pass fortune teller deck clockwise.  
   - Advance flame to next round.

#### Special Round Setup Rules
- **Round 2**: Reveal yellow ingredient book — yellow chips now purchasable.  
- **Round 3**: Reveal purple ingredient book — purple chips now purchasable.  
- **Round 6**: Each player adds 1 white 1-chip to their bag.  
- **Round 9**:  
  - Simultaneous drawing recommended.  
  - At end, may convert coins/rubies to VP:  
    - 5 coins = 1 VP  
    - 2 rubies = 1 VP  

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Bag Building**: Start with basic chips; buy stronger ones to reach farther.  
- **Push-Your-Luck**: Draw more to score higher, but risk explosion.  
- **Explosion**: Triggered when white chips sum > 7. Exploded players choose VP or shopping (not both).  
- **Chip Actions**:  
  - **Immediate (blue, red, yellow)**: Activate when drawn.  
  - **Delayed (black, green, purple)**: Activate during Evaluation Phase B.  
- **Catch-up Mechanism (Rats)**: Trailing players get rat stone boost based on gap to leader.  
- **Resource Management**: Rubies used to move droplet (start farther) or refill flask (prevent explosion).  
- **Flask**: Use once per turn to return most recent white chip (if not explosion-causing). Refill costs 2 rubies.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- After round 9, final scoring occurs.  
- Winner is player with highest VP total.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player who reached farthest space in round 9 wins.  
- If still tied, shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I look in my bag?** No.  
- **Can I use flask after explosion?** No — if white chip causes explosion, flask cannot be used.  
- **Do empty spaces block placement?** No — chips jump over gaps.  
- **Can I skip buying chips?** Yes.  
- **Can I use lower-tier chip action?** Yes — e.g., with 3 purple chips, may use 2-chip or 1-chip upgrade.  
- **Do chip actions stack?** No — only one bonus active at a time (e.g., blue chips: better bonus overrides).  
- **Can I save rubies?** Yes — no limit.  
- **Do overflow chips count?** Only white chips count toward explosion; all chips in overflow count for VP (value ÷ 2, round down).  
- **Simultaneous drawing in round 9**: Players draw together; to stop, reveal empty hand.
