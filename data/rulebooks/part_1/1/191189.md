**Turn Order Deck:**

- Shuffle the deck.

**Nemesis Setup:**
- Choose a nemesis and set its mat near the players.
- Set nemesis life according to its mat.
- Build the nemesis deck:
  - 9 nemesis-specific cards (3 per tier)
  - Add basic nemesis cards by player count:

    - 3 Players: 6 Tier 1, 7 Tier 2, 9 Tier 3
    - 4 Players: 9 Tier 1, 9 Tier 2, 11 Tier 3

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Turn Order:** Draw a turn order card to determine next turn.
2. **Player Turn:**
   - **Casting Phase:** Cast prepped spells. Must cast spells in closed breaches.
   - **Main Phase (any order, multiple times):**
     - Play a gem or relic
     - Gain a card (spend aether)
     - Gain a charge (spend 2 aether)
     - Focus a breach (pay focus cost)
     - Open a breach (pay open cost)
     - Prep a spell to a breach
     - Resolve a "While prepped" effect
     - Resolve a "TO DISCARD:" effect
   - **Draw Phase:** Place played gems/relics on discard pile. Draw until 5 cards in hand.
3. **Nemesis Turn:**
   - **Main Phase:** Resolve persistent effects of minions and powers (oldest first). Remove 1 power token from each power card. If a power card has 0 tokens, resolve its effect and discard.
   - **Draw Phase:** Draw a card from the nemesis deck:
     - **Attack:** Resolve immediately, then discard.
     - **Minion/Power:** Place in play with life/power tokens. Resolve "IMMEDIATELY:" effects.
     - **Empty Deck:** Unleash three times.
4. Repeat until game end.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Aether (①):** Currency gained by playing gems. Lost at end of turn if unspent.
- **Breaches:** Used to prep and cast spells. Closed breaches must be focused (rotated 90°) or opened (flipped). Spells in focused breaches must be cast next turn.
- **Prepping Spells:** Place a spell from hand to an opened breach or a breach focused this turn.
- **Charges:** Spent to activate mage abilities. Gain 1 charge per 2 aether spent. Max charges = ability cost.
- **Unleash:** Triggered by certain nemesis cards. Effect is unique to the nemesis.
- **"TO DISCARD:" Effects:** During a player's main phase, resolve the effect to discard a nemesis power card (prevents its resolution).
- **Exhausted:** When a player reaches 0 life:
  - Resolve Unleash twice.
  - Destroy one breach (discard prepped spell).
  - Discard all charges.
  - Cannot gain life.
  - Damage to exhausted player deals double damage to Gravehold.
  - Game ends if all players are exhausted.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Win Conditions (immediate win):**
- Nemesis has 0 life.
- Nemesis deck is empty and no minions or powers in play.

**Loss Conditions (immediate loss):**
- Gravehold has 0 life.
- All players are exhausted.
- Specific nemesis loss condition (e.g., Prince of Gluttons: all bellies full).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Deck Management:** Do not shuffle deck. When deck is empty, flip discard pile to form new deck.
- **Ambiguous Effects:** Players collectively decide (e.g., tied lowest life).
- **Card Order:** Cards are gained to discard pile immediately. Played gems/relics go to discard at end of turn (order chosen by player).
- **Multiple Effects:** Resolve in order written on card.
- **"OR" Effects:** Choose one option. If one cannot be resolved, choose the other.
