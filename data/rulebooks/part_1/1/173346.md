### 1. Lore & Objective
In 7 Wonders Duel, two civilizations vie for supremacy across three Ages by constructing buildings, developing economies, strengthening militaries, and advancing science. Victory is achieved through one of three paths:
- **Military Supremacy**: Move the Conflict pawn into your opponent’s capital.
- **Scientific Supremacy**: Collect 6 of the 7 unique scientific symbols.
- **Civilian Victory**: Score the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of Age III if no supremacy is achieved.

The game ends immediately upon a supremacy victory; otherwise, it concludes after Age III with final scoring.

### 2. Components
- 1 Game Board (with military track and Progress token spaces)
- 23 Age I cards, 23 Age II cards, 20 Age III cards
- 7 Guild cards (purple)
- 12 Wonder cards
- 4 Military tokens
- 10 Progress tokens
- Conflict pawn
- 31 Coins (in denominations of 1, 3, and 6)
- 1 Scorebook
- Rulebook and Helpsheet

### 3. Setup
1. Place the board between players. Position the Conflict pawn in the center of the track and place the 4 Military tokens on their designated spaces.
2. Shuffle the 10 Progress tokens and place 5 randomly on the board; return the rest to the box.
3. Each player takes 7 coins.
4. **Wonders Selection**:
   - Shuffle the 12 Wonder cards.
   - Reveal 4 face-up. First player takes 1, second player takes 2, first player takes the last.
   - Reveal another 4. Second player starts this round: takes 1, first takes 2, second takes the last.
   - Each player now has 4 Wonders, placed in a column to the left of their play area.
5. **Card Decks**:
   - From each Age deck (I, II, III), return 3 random cards to the box, unseen.
   - Randomly select 3 Guild cards and shuffle them into the Age III deck. Return the rest to the box.
6. Lay out the 20 cards of Age I in the prescribed pyramid structure (some face-up, some face-down).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Players alternate turns, starting with a randomly chosen first player in Age I.
- On your turn:
  1. Take an accessible card (not covered by others).
  2. Choose one of three actions:
     - **Construct the Building**: Pay its cost using your production and/or trading. Resolve effects.
     - **Discard for Coins**: Gain 2 coins + 1 per yellow card you own.
     - **Construct a Wonder**: Pay the Wonder’s cost; place the card under it. Resolve the Wonder’s effect.
  3. Reveal any newly accessible face-down cards.
- After all 20 cards of an Age are played:
  - Age ends.
  - The player with the weaker military (Conflict pawn on their side) chooses who starts the next Age. If tied, the last active player chooses.
  - Set up the next Age’s card structure.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Resource Production & Trading
- **Production**: Brown (raw materials), grey (manufactured goods), some yellow cards, and Wonders produce resources each turn. Resources are not consumed.
- **Trading**: For each missing resource, pay to the bank:
  > **Cost = 2 coins + number of that resource produced by opponent’s brown/grey cards**
- Some yellow cards reduce trade cost to 1 coin for specific resources.

#### Free Construction (Chaining)
- A card with a white chain symbol allows free construction of a later card that references it.
- Example: Build Baths (has 💠) → later build Aqueduct (costs 💠) for free.

#### Military
- Each shield (on red cards or Wonders) moves the Conflict pawn one space toward opponent’s capital.
- Entering a new zone triggers the Military token effect (e.g., opponent loses coins), then the token is removed.
- **Military Supremacy**: Win instantly if pawn reaches opponent’s capital.

#### Science & Progress Tokens
- 7 unique scientific symbols exist (6 on green cards, 1 on Law token).
- When you complete a pair (two of the same symbol), immediately take any Progress token from the board and apply its effect.
- **Scientific Supremacy**: Win instantly upon collecting 6 different symbols.

#### Wonders
- Each Wonder has a construction cost and a one-time effect.
- Only 7 Wonders may be built in total. When the 7th is completed, the 8th unconstructed Wonder is returned to the box.
- Wonder effects are resolved immediately upon construction.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
If no supremacy victory occurs, score VP at end of Age III:
- **Military VP**: Based on Conflict pawn position:
  - 0 VP (center), 2 VP (one zone), 5 VP (two zones), 10 VP (three zones).
- **Buildings**: VP shown on blue, green, yellow, and purple (Guild) cards.
- **Wonders**: VP shown on constructed Wonders.
- **Progress Tokens**: VP listed on each token.
- **Coins**: 1 VP per 3 coins (round down).
- **Guild Cards**:
  - **Builders Guild**: 2 VP per Wonder in the city with the most Wonders.
  - **Moneylenders Guild**: 1 VP per 3 coins in the richest city.
  - **Scientists, Shipowners, Traders, Magistrates, Tacticians Guilds**: 1 VP per card of the specified type in the city with the most of that type.
- **Tiebreaker**: Most VP from blue (civilian) cards. If still tied, shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Trading with Wonders**: Resources from Wonders (e.g., Great Lighthouse) count for production but **do not** affect opponent’s trade cost.
- **Chaining**: Only brown/grey/yellow cards provide chaining; Wonders do not.
- **Progress Token Choice**: When gaining a pair, you may choose any available token, regardless of symbol.
- **Discard Pile**: All discarded cards are face-down but can be viewed at any time.
- **Replay Effects**: If a Wonder grants an extra turn but no cards remain, the effect is lost.
- **Military Token Effects**: Applied only when pawn **enters** a new zone, not when passing through multiple in one turn.
