## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Pandemic Legacy Season 1 is a campaign-based cooperative board game where players take on roles in a global response team fighting the spread of deadly diseases over the course of a year (12–24 game sessions). The game evolves based on player decisions, with permanent changes made to the components via stickers, writing, and destruction. The objective is not to "win" in the traditional sense, but to complete the campaign and see how events unfold over time. Success is measured by cumulative performance across all games, tracked through a scoring system.

2. Components  
- Game board with cities and connections (includes drive/ferry routes between South America and Africa)  
- Disease cubes (4 colors) and outbreak markers  
- Player pawns, role cards, and character sheets  
- Player deck and infection deck  
- Legacy deck (contains scenario-specific instructions and events)  
- Research stations, military bases, and vaccination centers (represented by tokens and stickers)  
- Cure markers and infection rate tracker  
- Event cards (including funded event cards)  
- Objective cards  
- Scratch-off cards (used for revealing hidden content)  
- Writing implements (not included; recommended: fine-tip quick-dry marker)  
- Coin or scraper tool (for scratch-off cards)  
- Ziplock bag or container (for storing destroyed components)

3. Setup  
1. Refer to the Legacy Deck for scenario-specific setup instructions.  
2. Place the board and all game pieces within reach.  
3. Set outbreaks, cure markers, and objectives as directed by the current month’s Legacy card.  
4. Place the infection rate marker at the starting position.  
5. Infect 9 cities: draw 3 sets of infection cards—first 3 cities get 3 cubes each, next 3 get 2, last 3 get 1.  
6. Select 2 funded event cards randomly and shuffle them into the player deck.  
7. Deal player cards: 4 per player (2 players), 3 per player (3 players), 2 per player (4 players).  
8. Prepare the player deck by dividing it into 5 equal piles and placing one epidemic card in each (shuffle within pile).  
9. Players select characters and starting location (usually Atlanta or as specified).  
10. Use game-winning bonus if applicable (e.g., remove roadblocks, place quarantine, etc.).

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Players take turns performing up to 4 actions from a standard set: move, treat disease, share knowledge, build research station, discover cure.  
- After actions, draw 2 player cards.  
- Then draw infection cards equal to the current infection rate (from the bottom of the infection deck).  
- Resolve outbreaks when a city exceeds 3 cubes; chain reactions may occur.  
- Follow any special instructions from the Legacy deck during or after gameplay.  
- At the end of the game (win or lose), discuss and apply upgrades, scars, or other permanent changes as instructed.  
- Record results, including score and decisions, on tracking sheets.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Cooperative play: all players work together toward shared objectives.  
- Hand management: limited cards; must balance movement, cures, and events.  
- Infection spread: uses two-deck system (player and infection decks); epidemics increase infection rate and reshuffle discard pile into top of infection deck.  
- Legacy progression: permanent changes via stickers, writing on cards/boards, unlocking new rules, and destroying components.  
- Character development: earn upgrades and scars that modify abilities permanently.  
- Scenario variation: objectives and setup differ each month based on Legacy deck instructions.  
- Scoring: cumulative across games; used to determine final outcome regardless of individual game results.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Games are played over 12–24 sessions (approximately one per month).  
- Each game contributes to an overall score tracked externally (e.g., record sheet).  
- Final outcome is revealed in the December game; players reach this regardless of performance in earlier months.  
- At the end of each game, players choose upgrades (e.g., character abilities, starting assets) based on group discussion.  
- Destroyed or modified components remain changed for future games.  
- The campaign concludes with a definitive ending shaped by player choices and success level.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can players join/leave mid-campaign?** Yes. New players can join later; missing players can be skipped. Returning players should be briefed on changes.  
- **Do I need to leave the game set up between sessions?** No. The game can be fully packed away after each session.  
- **What if I accidentally destroy a card or scratch off too much?** Use the small white number in the corner of scratch cards to look up the text online. Keep destroyed items in a Ziplock bag for reference.  
- **What if we lose every game?** You still progress through the campaign. The story continues and culminates in a final game regardless of win/loss record.  
- **How do I track infections and epidemics?** Use the Pandemic Tracker:  
  - Infection Tracker: mark drawn infection cards, circle outbreak-only infections, cross out removed cards.  
  - Epidemic Tracker: track remaining cards in each player deck segment to anticipate epidemic draws.  
- **Writing tools:** Use a fine-tip, quick-dry marker (e.g., Ultra-fine Sharpie) to prevent smearing on glossy components.  
- **Scratch-off tips:** Use a coin or similar tool; avoid damaging underlying text. Tape may help lift foil cleanly but results vary.
