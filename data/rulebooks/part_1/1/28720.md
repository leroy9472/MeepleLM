### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each era (Canal, then Rail) consists of multiple rounds. A round consists of:  
1. **Turn Order Phase**: Players take turns in order  
2. **Action Phase**: Each player performs **2 actions** (1 action in Round 1 of Canal Era)  
3. **Turn Order Reset**: Reorder players by least to most £ spent  
4. **Refill Hands**: Draw up to 8 cards  
5. **Collect Income**: Gain or pay £ based on Income Track position  

Repeat until draw deck and all hands are exhausted → end of era.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions (Choose 2 per turn, 1 in first Canal round)  
- **Build Industry**  
  - Discard:  
    a) **Industry card** → build that industry in a location connected to your network (exception: 1st build can be anywhere)  
    b) **Location card** → build any industry in that location (no network required)  
    c) **Any 2 cards** → build any industry in any location (uses both actions)  
  - Must build lowest available tech level  
  - Pay cost shown on player mat  
  - Consume resources:  
    - **Coal**: From nearest connected unflipped coal mine; if none, pay market rate (must be connected to market trade icon)  
    - **Iron**: From any unflipped iron works; if none, pay market rate (no connection needed)  
  - Place resource cubes on tile as indicated  
  - **Special**:  
    - Level 1 industries only in Canal Era  
    - Shipyards cannot be built at Level 0; must be developed to Level 2 in Rail Era  
    - Canal Era: max 1 industry per player per city  
    - Rail Era: multiple industries per city allowed  

- **Overbuild**  
  - Replace existing industry with higher-tech version of same type  
  - **Own industry**: Always allowed; return cubes to supply  
  - **Opponent’s industry**: Only for coal mines and iron works; only if **no cubes of that resource** exist on board or in market  
  - Remove old tile; build new one as per Build rules  

- **Build Network Link**  
  - Discard any card  
  - Must connect to your network (your industry or link)  
  - **Canal Era**: Pay £3 per canal  
  - **Rail Era**: Pay £5 for one rail, £15 for two rails; each rail requires **1 coal** (from mine or market)  
  - Coal must be transported to link site before placement  

- **Sell Cotton**  
  - Discard any card  
  - Sell from one or more of your **face-up** cotton mills  
  - Options:  
    a) **To Port**: Must be connected to a face-up port (yours or another’s). Flip both cotton mill and port. Each owner gains income shown on tile.  
    b) **To Distant Market**: Must be connected to market trade icon. Flip one Distant Market tile per cotton mill sold. Move Cotton Demand marker down by value on tile.  
      - If marker reaches "X", action ends immediately; mill not flipped  
      - If not, gain income equal to marker value, then flip cotton mill and gain its income  
  - May sell multiple mills in one action  

- **Develop**  
  - Discard any card

  - **Cannot take loans once draw pile is exhausted in Rail Era**  

- **Pass**  
  - Discard any card to pass an action  

#### Flipping Tiles  
- **Coal Mine / Iron Works**: Flip when last cube is removed (by use or sale) → owner gains income shown on back  
- **Cotton Mill**: Flip when used to sell cotton → gain income  
- **Port**: Flip when used to sell cotton → owner gains income  
- **Shipyard**: Flip immediately when built

- **Preston**: Must build port in top box first if available  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Scoring occurs at the **end of Canal Era** and **end of Rail Era**.  

**Scoring Steps**:  
1. **Score Links (Canals or Rails)**  
   - 1 VP per **gold circle** adjacent to the link (on city spaces)  
   - Count both ends; opponent and external locations count  
   - Remove link tiles after scoring  

2. **Score Flipped Industry Tiles**  
   - Each flipped tile scores VP shown in bottom-left icon  
   - Unflipped tiles score nothing  
   - Tiles remain on board  

3. **End of Rail Era Only**:  
   - Score **1 VP per £10** held (round down)  

**End of Canal Era Maintenance**:  
- Remove all **canal links** and **Level 1 industry tiles** from board (not from player mats)  
- Reset Cotton Demand marker to top  
- Reshuffle Distant Market tiles into new face-down stack  
- Reshuffle draw deck: place deck tile (Nathan Rothschild side up) near bottom, with 2 cards per player beneath it  

**End of Game**:  
- Player with most VP wins  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Highest income  
  2. Most money  
  3. Earlier turn order (as if another round played)  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Negative Income**: Must pay bank. If insufficient £, remove industry tile(s), receive **½ cost (rounded down)**, use to pay. Repeat if needed.  
- **Hand Refill**: Refill to 8 cards each round. When deck is empty, continue until all hands are exhausted.  
- **Double Action Build**: Discard any 2 cards to build in any location (bypasses card requirements and network). Cannot be used on first turn of Canal Era.  
- **Shipyard Building**: Must be developed first; cannot build Level 0. Flip immediately when built.  
- **Overbuilding Opponent**: Only coal/iron works; requires **zero cubes of that resource** anywhere.  
- **Spent Money**: Placed in "Spent" box during actions; moved to bank when determining turn order.  
- **2-Player Variant**: Uses adjusted map, cards, and resources (see setup).
