## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West is a campaign-based evolution of the Ticket to Ride series, where players take on the roles of railroad tycoons building networks across the American West over multiple interconnected games. Over time, the game board, rules, and components permanently change based on player actions, unlocking new frontiers, mechanics, and story elements. The ultimate goal is to accumulate the most wealth (in dollars) over the course of the campaign by completing destination tickets, claiming routes, and leveraging legacy-specific events and bonuses.

Victory is determined at the end of each individual game, but long-term success depends on strategic decisions that affect future games. The final winner is the player with the highest total on their bank slip at the end of the campaign.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game in the campaign follows this turn structure:

**On Your Turn, Choose One Action:**
1. **Draw Train Cards**: Take 2 face-up cards (including locomotives) or 2 face-down from the deck. Cannot take both if one is a face-up locomotive.
2. **Draw Destination Tickets**: Draw 3 new tickets; keep at least 2.
3. **Claim a Route**: Play a set of train cards matching the route length and color to place your trains on a route. Routes may be regular, double, or tunnels (require additional cards).

**Special Mechanics (Unlocked During Campaign):**
- **Financier Employee (1877)**: When claiming a route, you may play up to 2 fewer train cards by paying $2 for each unplayed card.
- **Train Robbers! (Open Range)**: When a player claims a route using a locomotive, they may move the robber to a new city. Players with routes into that city must place $1 on the Dead Man’s Gulch card.
- **Treasure Hunting (Sierra Madre)**: Draw treasure map cards; if you collect the required number (initially 10, later reduced), scratch the Searching for Lost Treasure card for a cash reward.
- **Transcontinental Rail! (California)**: Damaged routes (e.g., from aftershocks) cannot be used unless repaired by discarding one locomotive per route.

**End of Game Triggers:**
- A player has 2 or fewer trains left.
- The Story Deck instructs a Game End.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Punching Completed Tickets**: After each game, players punch their completed tickets on their company’s color band. Each completed ticket is punched once.
- **Retiring Tickets**: If all circles on a ticket are punched (i.e., completed in every game), it is retired to the Dead Letter Office. Some retired tickets grant a postcard (IOU, favor, knowledge).
  - When retiring multiple tickets in one game, only one postcard may be taken.
  - Postcards are read aloud on the front; the back is kept secret until used.
- **Bank Slips**: Players total their earnings (from tickets, events, bonuses) and record on their bank slip. Total cannot go below $0.
- **Tiebreaker Rules**:
  1. Most completed tickets.
  2. Later turn order.
- **Caboose Card**: The last-place player takes the caboose card and stores it in their office.
- **Missed Games**: Players who missed a game receive a score revealed at the end of the campaign.

**Rulebook Updates**:
- After Game End, perform **Retire Tickets** after **Caboose** to ensure ties are broken using completed tickets.
- Retire and return tickets only after all ties are resolved.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Scoring Per Game**:
- **Completed Tickets**: Value in dollars as printed.
- **Uncompleted Tickets**: Subtract value.
- **Route Claims**: No direct point value, but enables ticket completion.
- **Bonuses**: From events, employees, postcards, etc.

**End of Campaign**:
- Final ranking is based on bank slip totals.

**After the Campaign**:
- Retire permanently:
  - Entire Story Deck
  - All postcards
  - Company bonus cards
  - Curse cards, ghost train, ghost die
  - Treasure map cards and Searching for Lost Treasure card
  - Robber

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: When do I punch a ticket?**  
A: After each game, punch each completed ticket once on your company’s color band.

**Q: Can I get more than one postcard when retiring tickets?**  
A: No. Even if multiple tickets grant postcards, you may choose only one per game.

**Q: What happens to Dead Man’s Gulch if the robber is jailed?**  
A: The card is retired (per errata). Any remaining coins return to supply.

**Q: How many punches does Dead Man’s Gulch have?**  
A: Four. The fourth punch triggers Postcard 405.

**Q: Can I use Postcard 123 during the game?**  
A: Yes. After claiming a route, you may retire it to add your color sticker to any trackbed (not tunnel) between two cities. If not used, return it to your office. Worth $6 at campaign end if still there.

**Q: What if the treasure map draw requirement is too hard?**  
A: In post-campaign play (1901), reduce required cards to 6 and award flat $10.

**Q: How is the robber moved in 1901 optional rules?**  
A: Optionally, move robber only when connecting to its current city, with new location needing an unclaimed route.
