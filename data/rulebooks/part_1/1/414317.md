## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Harmonies*, players build landscapes by placing colored tokens to create habitats for animals. The goal is to score the most points by strategically arranging tokens into scoring elements (Trees, Mountains, Fields, Water, Buildings) and placing animals in their required habitats. The player with the highest score wins; ties are broken by the number of animal cubes placed.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Pouch  
- 1 Central board (2–4 player side or Solo side)  
- 4 Personal boards (Side A or B)  
- 4 Reminder cards  
- 120 Tokens:  
  - 23 blue (water)  
  - 23 gray (mountains)  
  - 21 brown (wood)  
  - 19 green (trees)  
  - 19 yellow (fields)  
  - 15 red (buildings)  
- 66 Animal cubes  
- 4 Nature’s Spirit cubes  
- 32 Animal cards  
- 10 Nature’s Spirit cards  
- 1 Scoresheet pad  
- Rulebook  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place Central board with 2–4 player side faceup.  
2. Fill each of 5 spaces on Central board with 3 randomly drawn tokens from the Pouch.  
3. Shuffle Animal cards and place 5 faceup next to Central board; rest form draw pile.  
4. Each player takes:  
   - 1 Personal board (all players use same side: A or B)  
   - 1 Reminder card (matching Personal board side)  
5. First player is the one who last saw a magnificent landscape; point Central board arrow toward them.  

*(Optional: For solo or advanced variants, adjust setup accordingly.)*

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Starting with first player and proceeding clockwise, each turn consists of:  

**Mandatory Action:**  
- **Take and Place Tokens:** Take 3 tokens from one space on Central board. Place them on your Personal board following stacking rules.  

**Optional Actions (in any order, between token placements):**  
- **Take 1 Animal Card:** Choose 1 of 5 faceup Animal cards. Place it above your board. Take animal cubes equal to spaces on card and place on card. Max 4 cards above board.  
- **Place 1 Animal Cube:** Place bottom cube from an Animal card onto matching token in a completed habitat. Can be done multiple times per turn.  

**End of Turn:**  
- Refill all spaces on Central board to 3 tokens each.  
- Refill faceup Animal cards to 5 if needed.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Token Placement Rules  
- Can be placed on empty space.  
- Can stack:  
  - **Trees:** Green token on 0–2 brown tokens (height 1–3).  
  - **Mountains:** 1–3 gray tokens stacked.  
  - **Buildings:** Red token on brown, gray, or red token.  
- Cannot place under existing tokens.  
- Cannot place on space occupied by animal cube.  

#### Animal Card Placement  
- Habitat pattern must exactly match card (any orientation).  
- Tree and Mountain heights must match card.  
- Target token must be unoccupied.  
- Buildings: bottom token can be red, brown, or gray.  
- A single token can be part of multiple habitats.  
- Once placed, animal cube is final—even if structure changes.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Triggers (check after each turn):  
- A player has 2 or fewer empty spaces on their Personal board.  
- Pouch is empty when refilling Central board.  
End the current round so all players have equal turns.  

#### Scoring  

**Landscapes:**  
- **Trees:** 1 pt per height (e.g., 3 brown + 1 green = 4-height Tree = 4 pts).  
- **Mountains:** 1 pt per height, **but 0 pts if not adjacent to another Mountain**.  
- **Fields (yellow):** 5 pts per contiguous group of 2+ yellow tokens. Larger groups still score only 5 pts.  
- **Water – Side A (River):** Score best river. Length = shortest path. 1–6 tokens: 1 pt each. 7+: 4 pts each beyond 6th.  
- **Water – Side B (Islands):** 5 pts per island (area surrounded by blue tokens).  
- **Buildings:** 5 pts each, **only if surrounded by at least 3 different top token colors** (adjacent spaces, top layer only).  

**Animals:**  
- Score points shown on topmost empty space of each Animal card.  
- Completed card (all cubes placed) scores full points.  
- Incomplete cards score partial points; no penalty.  

**Nature’s Spirit Cards (optional):**  
- Deal 2 face down; choose 1 to keep, return other.  
- Place Spirit cube like animal cube.  
- Score based on card’s special condition (e.g., number of Mountains, connected yellow groups).  
- Points added to total.  

**Final Scoring:**  
- Sum Landscape and Animal points.  
- **Tiebreaker:** Most animal cubes placed. If still tied, share victory.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place tokens and do optional actions in any order?** Yes—after taking 3 tokens, you can place one, then take a card, place another, place a cube, etc.  
- **Can a token be part of multiple habitats?** Yes.  
- **Do I lose points if a habitat is broken after placing an animal?** No—placement is final.  
- **Can I take a card if I already have 4?** No—max 4 incomplete cards above board.  
- **What if Animal card draw pile runs out?** Refill from discard when replacing cards.  
- **Can I use both Nature’s Spirit and solo rules?** Yes, if desired.
