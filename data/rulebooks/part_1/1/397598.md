# Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
You are a Leader representing one of the Great Houses of the Landsraad or another powerful figure in the Imperium. The Emperor has granted House Harkonnen control of Arrakis, but a new force—Muad'Dib—has risen among the Fremen, threatening the balance of power. Your goal is to defeat rivals in combat, wield political influence, and form alliances with the four major Factions: the Emperor, Spacing Guild, Bene Gesserit, and Fremen. Victory Points (VP) are earned through Influence, Alliances, Conflict victories, and card effects. The game ends when any player reaches 10 or more VP, or the Conflict Deck is empty. The player with the most VP wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of five phases:
1. **Round Start**: Reveal top Conflict card. Each player draws 5 cards.
2. **Player Turns**: Players take turns (clockwise from First Player), choosing either:
   - **Agent Turn**: Play a card, send Agent to matching board space.
   - **Reveal Turn**: Reveal all remaining hand cards, resolve Reveal effects, acquire cards, set strength.
   - Once a player takes a Reveal Turn, they are skipped for the rest of the phase.
3. **Combat**: Resolve Conflict rewards based on strength. Players may play Combat Intrigue cards.
4. **Makers**: Add 1 spice to each unoccupied Maker space (Deep Desert, Hagga Basin, Imperial Basin, Habbanya Erg in 6-player).
5. **Recall**: Return Agents to Leaders. Pass First Player marker. If any player has ≥10 VP or Conflict Deck is empty, end game.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Deck-Building**: Acquire new cards during Reveal turns using Persuasion. Cards go to discard pile; reshuffle when deck is empty.
- **Agents & Cards**: Each card has Agent and Reveal effects. To send an Agent, play a card with a matching Agent icon. Only one Agent per space unless using Spy to Infiltrate.
- **Spies**:
  - Place via Spy icon (on card or space).
  - **Infiltrate**: Recall a Spy to place Agent on occupied space.
  - **Gather Intelligence**: Recall a Spy when placing Agent to draw 1 card.
  - **Spy Icon**: Use to send Agent to any space connected to your occupied observation post.
- **Influence & Alliances**:
  - Gain 1 Influence when sending Agent to Faction space.
  - At 2 Influence: gain 1 VP.
  - At 4 Influence: gain track bonus. First to 4 gains Alliance token and 1 VP. If passed, token and VP transfer.
- **Combat**:
  - **Units**: Troops (2 strength each), Sandworms (3 strength each).
  - **Strength**: Sum of units in Conflict + swords revealed.
  - **Sandworms**: Summon only if you have a Maker Hook and Conflict is not behind Shield Wall.
  - **Shield Wall**: Protects Arrakeen, Spice Refinery, Imperial Basin. Can be destroyed via effect (removes token).
- **Control**:
  - Win Control of Arrakeen, Spice Refinery, or Imperial Basin via Conflict reward.
  - Controller gains bonus when any player uses the space.
  - When same location is contested again, controller may deploy 1 troop from supply.
- **Battle Icons**: When winning a Conflict, check for matching battle icon (Crysknife, Desert Mouse, Ornithopter) on another face-up Conflict or Objective card. If matched, flip both face down and gain 1 VP. Wild icons can match any at endgame.
- **Sandworm Reward Doubling**: If you have ≥1 sandworm in Conflict, double your rewards (except Control or battle icons). For optional-cost rewards, pay cost again to gain effect again.
