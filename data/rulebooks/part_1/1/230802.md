## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Azul*, players take on the role of tile-laying artisans commissioned by King Manuel I of Portugal to decorate the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora with vibrant Moorish tiles. Inspired by the beauty of the Alhambra Palace, the goal is to earn the most victory points by strategically placing tiles on your wall to form patterns, while minimizing penalties from misplaced tiles.

The game ends immediately after the Wall-Tiling phase in which **at least one player completes a full horizontal row of 5 tiles** on their wall. Final scoring determines the winner.

---

### 3. Setup

2. Place Factory Displays in a circle:
   - 2 players: 5 displays

3. Place all 100 tiles into the linen bag.
4. The player who most recently visited Portugal becomes the Starting Player:

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:

1. **Factory Offer**  
2. **Wall-Tiling**  
3. **Prepare for Next Round**

Repeat until at least one player completes a horizontal row on their wall.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Phase 1: Factory Offer  
- The Starting Player places the Starting Player Marker in the center of the table.
- Players take turns clockwise.
- On your turn, choose **one** of the following:
  - **Take all tiles of one color** from a single Factory Display.  
    → Move all remaining tiles from that display to the **center area**.
  - **Take all tiles of one color** from the center area.  
    → If you are the **first** to take from the center this round, take the Starting Player Marker and place it on the **leftmost free space** of your **floor line**.

##### Adding Tiles to Your Board
After taking tiles:
- Add **all** selected tiles to **one** of your 5 pattern lines (left side of board), placing them **right to left**.
- Rules:
  - You may only add tiles to a pattern line if:
    - It is empty, **or**
    - It already contains tiles of the **same color**.
  - If the line becomes full (1–5 spaces, depending on row), it is **complete**.
    - Any excess tiles go to the **floor line**, placed **left to right**.
    - If the floor line is full, excess tiles go to the **box lid** (no penalty).
  - You **may not** place tiles of a color that already appears in the **corresponding wall row**.
  - You **may** place tiles directly on the floor line instead of a pattern line.
  - You **may** have multiple incomplete pattern lines with the same color.
  - You **must** take tiles; passing is not allowed.

This phase ends when **all Factory Displays and the center area are empty**.

---

#### Phase 2: Wall-Tiling  
All players act simultaneously.

For each **complete** pattern line, from **top to bottom**:
1. Move the **rightmost tile** to the **matching colored space** on the corresponding wall row.
2. **Score immediately** for that tile:
   - If no adjacent tiles (horizontal or vertical): **1 point**
   - Otherwise:
     - Score **1 point per tile** in the **horizontal line** (including itself)
     - Score **1 point per tile** in the **vertical line** (including itself)
     - Add both values for total points
3. Return all **remaining tiles** in the completed pattern line to the **box lid**.
4. **Incomplete** pattern lines remain untouched.

##### Special Case: Cannot Place Tile
- If the required wall space is **already occupied**, you **cannot** place the tile.
- In this case, move **all tiles** from that pattern line to the **floor line** (left to right).

---

#### Floor Line Scoring
After placing all possible tiles:
- For each tile (including the Starting Player Marker) on your floor line:
  - **Lose** points as indicated above each space:  
    - Spaces 1–2: -1 each  
    - Spaces 3–5: -2 each  
    - Spaces 6–7: -3 each  
    - (Total possible penalty: -17)
- Adjust score accordingly. **Score cannot drop below 0.**
- Return all tiles from the floor line to the **box lid**, **except**:
  - The **Starting Player Marker** is kept by its owner for the next round.

---

#### Phase 3: Prepare for Next Round  
- If **no player** has completed a full horizontal row on their wall:
  - The player with the Starting Player Marker **refills** each Factory Display with **4 tiles** drawn from the bag.
  - If the bag is empty:
    - Refill the bag with tiles from the **box lid**, then continue.
  - If there are not enough tiles to fully refill all displays, proceed with what is available.
  - Place the Starting Player Marker in the center.
  - Begin the next round.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Final Scoring (after Wall-Tiling phase when ≥1 player completes a row)  
All players score **additional points**:
- **+2 points** for each **complete horizontal row** (5 tiles)
- **+7 points** for each **complete vertical column** (5 tiles)
- **+10 points** for each **color** for which all 5 tiles are placed on the wall

#### Winning the Game  
- The player with the **most total points** wins.
- **Tiebreaker**:
  1. Most completed **horizontal rows**
  2. If still tied, **shared victory**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I place tiles in a pattern line if the wall already has that color?**  
A: No. Once a color is placed in a wall row, you cannot start or add to a pattern line in the same row with that color.

**Q: What if I complete a pattern line but the wall space is taken?**  
A: Move all tiles from that pattern line to your floor line.

**Q: Can I place tiles on multiple pattern lines in one turn?**  
A: No. All tiles taken must go to **one** pattern line (excess to floor).

**Q: Can I skip placing tiles on a pattern line and put them all on the floor?**  
A: Yes. This is allowed, though penalized.

**Q: What happens to the Starting Player Marker after scoring?**  
A: It stays with the player who took it until the next round begins. That player starts the next round and places it in the center.

**Q: Can I score zero during Wall-Tiling?**  
A: No. Even an isolated tile scores **1 point**.

**Q: Do adjacent tiles include diagonals?**  
A: No. Only **horizontal and vertical** adjacents count.

---

### Variant Play (Grey Wall Side)  
- Rules are identical **except**:
  - When placing a tile from a complete pattern line, you may place it in **any empty space** on the corresponding wall row.
  - However, **no color may appear more than once in any vertical column**.
- If a tile cannot be placed due to column conflict, move the entire pattern line to the **floor line**.

### Joker Tiles (Optional Expansion)  

#### Setup  
- 2 players: Remove 1 tile of each color, add 5 Joker tiles  
- 3–4 players: Remove 2 tiles of each color, add 10 Joker tiles  

#### Gameplay  
- During **Factory Offer**:
  - You may take **all Joker tiles** from a Factory Display or center.
  - If you do, you **may also** take **all tiles of one other color** from the **same location**.
  - All tiles taken (Jokers + other color) must go to **one pattern line**.
  - Pattern lines may contain **one color and/or Jokers**.
- During **Wall-Tiling**:
  - If a complete pattern line contains **at least one Joker**, **reorder** the tiles so the **rightmost** is a Joker.
  - Move the **Joker** to the wall.
    - If the line has **only Jokers**: place it on **any empty space** in the corresponding wall row.
    - If the line has **Jokers + one color**: place the Joker on the **space matching that color** (colored side only).
- **Restriction**: If a Joker occupies a colored space on the wall, you **cannot** place tiles of that color in the corresponding pattern line.
- **End Game**: Jokers **do not** count toward completing a color set (no +10 points for a color with 4 real tiles + 1 Joker).
