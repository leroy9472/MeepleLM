## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Lords of Waterdeep is a worker placement game where players take on the role of masked rulers of the city of Waterdeep, competing to gain influence through completing quests, building structures, and manipulating intrigue. The goal is to amass the most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the 8th round through:  
- Completing quests (immediate rewards and endgame scoring)  
- Fulfilling Lord-specific bonuses  
- Managing resources (adventurers, gold, intrigue cards)  
- Strategic building ownership  
- Minimizing penalties (e.g., corruption in expansions)  

In solo play, the player competes against a scripted AI opponent ("Pseudo" or "AI") that follows deterministic or probabilistic rules to simulate an intelligent opponent. The challenge lies in balancing long-term strategy with reactive play against the AI’s predictable yet adaptive behavior.

### 3. Setup  
#### Base Game (2–5 players)  
1. Each player selects a color, takes matching agents, control markers, and player mat.  
2. Place one extra agent near Round 5 space (used in Round 5).  
3. Place score markers at 0 on VP track.  
4. Place 3 VP tokens on each Round Track space.  
5. Reveal 3 building tiles in Builder’s Hall.  
6. Shuffle and deal:  
   - 1 Lord card (face down) per player  
   - 2 Quest cards (face up) per player  
   - 4 Quest cards (face up) at Cliffwatch Inn  
   - 2 Intrigue cards (face down) per player  
7. Determine starting player (e.g., most recent city visitor); they take first player marker.  
8. Distribute starting gold: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 depending on player order.  

#### Solo Variant Setup (SoCalDoug v1.0)  
1. Remove from game:  
   - Buildings: Palace of Waterdeep, The Zoarstar, Waymoot  
   - Lords: Larissa Neathal  
   - Quests: Recruit the Lieutenant, Place a Sleeper Agent in Skullport  
2. Give first player token to AI.  
3. AI does **not** receive starting gold or intrigue cards.  
4. AI draws Lord card matching player’s Lord bonus type (draw until match).  
5. Quests: Place face up in order; topmost = highest priority.  

#### Solo Variant Setup (Michele Esmanech / Sleepstupid)  
1. Set up as 2-player game.  
2. AI gets:  
   - Faction color and components  
   - One Lord card (face up or face down, depending on variant)  
   - VP marker at 0  
3. AI starts with 2 VP (instead of 4 gold).  
4. Player gets 5 gold (4 +1 for going second).  
5. AI is starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds as follows:  

#### Start of Round  
- Place 1 VP token on each faceup building in Builder’s Hall.  
- Resolve start-of-round effects on owned buildings.  
- In Round 5, all players gain an extra agent.  

#### Player Turns (Clockwise)  
While players have agents:  
1. **Assign Agent**: Place one agent on an unoccupied action space. Must be able to perform the action.  
2. **Optional: Complete Quest**: After assigning agent, may complete **one** quest if requirements are met.  
   - Mandatory quests must be completed first.  
   - Plot quests remain face up for ongoing effects.  

#### End of Round  
- Players with agents in Waterdeep Harbor reassign them to other action spaces (in order 1–3), resolving the new action.  
- Cannot reassign to Waterdeep Harbor.  
- Return all agents to pools.  
- Next round begins.  

Game ends after Round 8.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Worker Placement  
- Each agent placement grants a specific action.  
- Cannot place on occupied space (unless using Recover the Magister’s Orb or similar).  
- Must be able to fulfill action (e.g., pay cost for building).  

#### Quests  
- **Types**: Arcana (Wizard), Piety (Cleric), Skullduggery (Rogue), Warfare (Fighter), Commerce (any + gold).  
- **Plot Quests**: Ongoing effects after completion.  
- **Mandatory Quests**: Must be completed before other quests. Given via intrigue cards.  

#### Buildings  
- **Builder’s Hall**: Pay cost to build; place control marker; gain immediate VP and “When Purchased” effect.  
- **Owner Benefit**: Triggered whenever **any** player uses the building.  
- No limit on number of buildings in play (only limited by control markers).  

#### Intrigue Cards  
- Played at Waterdeep Harbor.  
- Effects vary: resource gain, disruption, quest manipulation.  
- Some require opponent decisions—player decides for AI in solo.  

#### Solo AI Behavior (SoCalDoug v1.0)  
AI follows priority hierarchy each turn:  
1. Get to 1 Quest (prioritize Lord’s VP bonus type)  
2. Match player’s number of buildings (up to 3)  
3. Play 1 Intrigue card per round (top of deck)  
4. Acquire top-priority needed resource  
5. Get to 2 Quests  
6. Acquire any needed resource  
7. Take first player marker (Castle Waterdeep)  
8. Reach 8 gold  
9. Build 4-VP building if behind in buildings  
10. Gain Intrigue card  
11. Gain resource matching Lord’s VP bonus  

In **Final Round/Turn**, AI prioritizes immediate VP:  
- 2 gold = 1 VP  
- 1 cube = 1 VP (matching Lord’s bonus preferred)  
- Buildings with VP chits  

#### Solo AI Behavior (Dice-Based Variant)  
- Roll D12 to determine AI action:  
  - 1–3: Cliffwatch Inn (specific spaces)  
  - 4: Grinning Lion Tavern  
  - 5: Builder’s Hall → build highest-VP available building  
  - 6: Waterdeep Harbor → play top intrigue card  
  - 7: Castle Waterdeep  
  - 8: Blackstaff Tower  
  - 9: Fields of Triumph  
  - 10: Random building (D10)  
  - 11: Skullport (D6)  
  - 12: Undermountain (D6)  
- If space occupied, move clockwise to next available.  
- AI scores VP immediately for:  
  - 1 adventurer = 1 VP  
  - 2 gold = 1 VP  
- Completes quests immediately if requirements met; scores VP.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
At end of Round 8:  

#### Player Scoring  
- 1 VP per adventurer in tavern  
- 1 VP per 2 gold (round down)  
- Lord bonus: +4 VP per completed quest matching Lord’s type  
- Plot quest bonuses (if applicable)  
- Subtract VP for uncompleted quests (in some variants: −5 each)  
- **Corruption Penalty** (Scoundrels of Skullport):  
  - Each corruption token in tavern = −X VP, where X = value of highest empty corruption track space  

#### AI Scoring  
- Tracks VP throughout game (immediate scoring for resources, quests, buildings)  
- At end: +4 VP per completed quest matching Lord’s type  
- Subtract corruption penalties  

**Winner**: Highest total VP. Tiebreaker: most gold.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can you assign an agent to a space you can’t use?**  
  A: No. You must be able to perform the full action (e.g., pay building cost).  

- **Q: Can you complete a quest after reassigning from Waterdeep Harbor?**  
  A: Yes. Reassignment is a full turn.  

- **Q: Does “gain resources” from plot quests count as “taking an action”?**  
  A: No. Only direct agent placements or intrigue cards count.  

- **Q: Can more than 10 buildings be in play?**  
  A: Yes. Limited only by control markers, not board space.  

- **Q: What if AI draws an unplayable intrigue card?**  
  A: (SoCalDoug) Discard and draw another. (Dice variant) Resolve immediately; if decision needed, player chooses.  

- **Q: Does AI complete quests in priority order?**  
  A: No. Completes **any** quest as soon as requirements are met.  

- **Q: What happens if no spaces are available?**  
  A: Round ends immediately.  

- **Q: Can you use “Bribe Agent” or “Zoarstar” on Waterdeep Harbor?**  
  A: Yes, to play an intrigue card—but cannot reassign the agent (no physical agent to reassign).  

- **Q: Does AI get owner benefits?**  
  A: Yes. When AI uses a building, owner (player or AI) gets benefit.  

- **Q: Can AI complete more than one quest per turn?**  
  A: No. Maximum one quest per agent placement.
