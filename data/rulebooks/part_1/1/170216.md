The world is approaching Ragnarök, the prophesied end of days. As a Viking clan leader, you seek to earn eternal glory by commanding your warriors in battle, pillaging provinces, completing divine quests, and dying valiantly. The player who accumulates the most glory by the end of the third Age wins and earns a place in Valhalla.

   - 4 players: keep all
   - 3 players: remove all "4+" cards
   - 2 players: remove all "3+" and "4+" cards

13. Give First Player Token to player born furthest north.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the three Ages consists of six phases in order:

**1. Gods' Gifts Phase**
- Players place any leftover card from previous Age face down on clan sheet.
- Deal 8 cards from current Age deck to each player.
- Draft: Players simultaneously select one card to keep, pass remaining cards left (right in Age 2), repeat until 6 cards kept.
- Discard remaining 2 cards per player.
- Players now have hand of 6 + possible leftover card.

**2. Action Phase**
- Players begin with Rage equal to current Rage stat.
- Starting with First Player, players take turns performing one action:
  - **Invade**: Pay Rage equal to figure's STR to place from reserve to empty village (not Yggdrasil). Leader invades free.
  - **March**: Pay 1 Rage to move any number of figures from one province to another (destination need not be adjacent). Cannot move Ships.
  - **Upgrade**: Pay Rage equal to card's STR to place Upgrade card on clan sheet in appropriate slot (replacing existing card if any). May immediately invade with corresponding figure for free.
  - **Quest**: Commit to Quest card by placing it face down on clan sheet. No Rage cost.
  - **Pillage**: Attempt to pillage province with your figure present (or in supporting fjord) and un-pillaged token.
- Action Phase ends when all players have 0 Rage OR all undestroyed provinces are pillaged.

**3. Discard Phase**
- Players discard all cards except one to keep for next Age.
- In Age 3, discard all cards.

**4. Quest Phase**
- Players reveal all committed Quest cards.
- For each completed Quest, gain Glory and raise one clan stat by 1.
- Discard all revealed Quest cards.

**5. Ragnarök Phase**
- Place current Ragnarök Token on indicated province ("destroyed" side up).
- All figures in that province and its supporting fjord are destroyed and sent to Valhalla.
- Each destroyed figure earns its owner Glory: 2 in Age 1, 3 in Age 2, 4 in Age 3.
- Move Doom Token to province indicated by next Age's Ragnarök Token.

**6. Release Valhalla Phase**
- All figures in Valhalla return to their owner's reserve.

**End of Age**
- Flip all Pillage Tokens back to reward side.
- Pass First Player Token to the left.
- Move Saga Token to first phase of next Age.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Rage**: Currency for actions. Players start each Action Phase with Rage equal to their Rage stat.
- **Battle Resolution**:
  1. **Call to Battle**: After Pillage declaration, players may move figures from adjacent provinces into battle.
  2. **Play Cards**: All participants simultaneously reveal one card. Only Battle cards add STR and trigger effects.
  3. **Resolution**: Highest total STR wins. On tie, all lose. Winner discards played cards, gains Glory equal to Axes stat. Losers keep cards, lose all figures in battle.
- **Pillage Rewards**:
  - +1 Rage stat
  - +1 Axes stat
  - +1 Horns stat
  - +5 Glory
  - Yggdrasil: +1 to all three stats
- **Quests**: Completed in Quest Phase. Most require having most STR in specific province/region. Ties fail.
- **Upgrades**: Cards provide permanent effects. Monster Upgrades add figure to reserve. Replacing cards discards old one.
- **Horns Limit**: Maximum figures on board equals Horns stat.
- **Yggdrasil**: No villages, so no limit on figures. Can only be reached via March.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after Release Valhalla Phase of Age 3. Final scoring:
- Glory from all sources during game
- **Legendary Stat Bonuses**:
  - +10 Glory for each clan stat at 4th or 5th level
  - +20 Glory for each clan stat at 6th (final) level
Player with most total Glory wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **0 Rage**: Cannot take any actions, even free ones. Can still participate in battles.
- **Passing**: Loses all remaining Rage, cannot take further actions.
- **Battle Effects Timing**: Effects that trigger "before comparing STR" resolve before winner determination.
- **Card Drafting**: In 2-player game, draft 2 cards at a time.
- **Ties**: In battle, all participants lose. In Quests, ties fail.
- **Figure Destruction**: Destroyed figures go to Valhalla, return next Age.
- **Multiple Effects**: Effects from different cards stack unless identical.
- **Leader Abilities**: Always retained even when upgraded.
- **Monster Limits**: Maximum 2 Monsters per clan. Replacing Monster card returns old figure to box.
