### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On each turn, the active player follows these steps in order:  

#### 1. Ship Action  
Choose one of the five ship rooms (must be different from previous turn). Apply effect:  
- **Bridge**: Draw 1 ability card, gain command, return all command tokens from crew and adventure cards to supply.  
- **Galley**: Draw 1 or 2 ability cards (1 if 1–2 players), gain command, optionally discard 1 ability card to remove 1 fatigue from any crew member.  
- **Deck**: Gain command, optionally draw up to 3 search tokens one at a time. Apply all damage shown, keep reward from only one token. Discard tokens after.  
- **Quarters**: Draw 1 ability card, gain command, return 2 or 3 command tokens (2 if 1–2 players) from crew/adventure cards to supply.  
- **Sick Bay**: Draw 1 ability card, gain command, restore 1 health to any crew member.  

A room cannot be used if it has 2 damage. If no room is usable, move action figure but take no effect.  

#### 2. Event  
Draw the top event card and resolve its effect. Events may present choices, challenges, or consequences.  
- If the event deck is exhausted:  
  - First time: Read paragraph 1.  
  - Second time: Read paragraph 1.2.  
  - Third time: Read paragraph F1.  
- Ongoing events remain active until discarded per card instructions.  

#### 3. Two Actions  
Perform any two actions (may repeat the same action twice). Skipping an action grants 1 command.  
Available actions:  
- **Travel**: Move ship to adjacent region. Optionally assign a crew member to participate (they gain 1 fatigue). Draw fate, add CRAFT skill, compare to travel table for movement range. Hazards trigger challenges when entered.  
- **Explore**: Visit a red-circled location in the current region. Read storybook entry, make choices, overcome challenges or combat. "Return to the ship" ends the action.  
- **Visit a Market**: Draw 7 market cards, purchase any. Place purchased cards faceup near ship. Return others to bottom of deck.  
- **Visit a Port**: Perform one or more of:  
  - **Inn**: Pay 4 coins to restore 1 health and remove 1 fatigue from all crew.  
  - **Shipyard**: Pay 1 material or coin per ship damage repaired.  
  - **Healer**: Pay 1 coin to fully heal one crew member.  
  - **Spend XP**: Spend XP to buy level cards (cost listed on card). Equip immediately.  

#### 4. End of Turn  
Pass the captain token to the left. Next player begins their turn.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Challenges  
1. Choose participating crew members (from your control or Captain Odessa). Crew with 2 fatigue cannot participate.  
2. Pay 1 command per crew member from another player to include them.  
3. Each participant gains 1 fatigue.  
4. Draw fate (ability card, check number, discard). Add total skill of participants.  
5. Use crew abilities, adventure cards, or discard ability cards from hand (+1 skill per card) to modify total.  
6. If total ≥ challenge number, succeed; else, suffer consequences.  
7. If not redirected, continue reading story as if succeeded.  

#### Combat  
- Triggered when story ends with "COMBAT" and enemy numbers.  
- Retrieve listed enemy cards, shuffle, place faceup in a row.  
- Distribute 4 combat action tokens:  
  - 4 players: 1 each  
  - 3 players: active player gets 2, others 1  
  - 2 players: 2 each  
  - 1 player: all 4  
- Place synergy tokens on matching crew boards.  

**Combat Round**:  
1. **Attack and Counterattack**: Players use tokens in any order.  
   - Choose crew member and weapon. Place token on crew board.  
   - Choose enemy target.  
   - Draw fate, add to weapon accuracy. Compare to enemy defense.  
     - Hit: Place damage adjacently (not diagonally). Cover heart symbols to defeat.  
     - Miss: Deal 1 damage after counterattack.  
   - If enemy not defeated, it counterattacks (damage = base + exposed symbols). Apply block from weapon.  
   - Splash damage: Up to half (rounded up) can go to adjacent enemies.  
   - Double/Triple hearts: Require 2 or 3 damage to cover.  
   - Flying: +1 defense vs. non-ranged weapons.  
   - Synergy: If damage placed on synergy square (red diamond), place your synergy token on another crew board. Can be used later.  
2. **End of Round**: Remaining enemies attack. Active player assigns targets. Damage must go to one crew per enemy. Apply end-of-round abilities (e.g., Regen, Disarm).  

Combat ends when all enemies are defeated or all crew have 0 health.  

#### Spending Command  
Command tokens can be spent at any time, even on others’ turns:
