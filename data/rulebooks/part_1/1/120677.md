### 3. Setup
1. Place game board and cult board in center.
2. Randomly draw 6 Scoring tiles and place face-up in order (left to right: Round 1 to 6), covering the right half of the top tile with the Game end token.
3. Shuffle 9 Bonus cards and randomly draw (3 + number of players) cards, placing them face-up.
4. Sort and place Favor tiles by type in 12 stacks.
5. Place Town tiles face-up nearby.
6. Players choose factions (or use pre-assigned for first game).
7. Each player takes faction board and colored components:
   - Place 7 Priests and 3 Bridges next to board
   - Place Structures on corresponding tracks
   - Markers: VP at 20, Shipping at 0 (except Mermaids at 1), Exchange at 3 Workers per Spade (except Darklings), Cult tracks at 0 (advance 1 space for each cult symbol on faction board)
   - Starting resources: Workers, Coins, Priests as shown
   - Distribute 12 Power tokens between Bowls I and II as shown
8. Starting player places first Dwelling on home terrain; players proceed clockwise.
9. Last player places second Dwelling; players proceed counterclockwise.
10. Last player chooses first Bonus card; players proceed counterclockwise.
11. Place 1 Coin on each unclaimed Bonus card.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round has three phases:

**Phase I: Income**
- Collect resources from built Structures, Bonus card, and Favor tiles (indicated by hand icon).
- Resources: Workers from Dwellings, Coins from Trading Houses, Priests from Temples/Sanctuaries, Power from Trading Houses/Strongholds.

**Phase II: Actions**
- Players take turns clockwise, each choosing one action until all pass.
- Actions (can repeat except Pass):
  1. **Transform and Build**: Transform one adjacent terrain (costs Spades), then optionally build Dwelling on transformed home terrain.
  2. **Advance Shipping**: Pay cost to move marker; gain VP and increase indirect adjacency range.
  3. **Lower Exchange Rate**: Pay cost to reduce Worker-to-Spade cost; gain VP.
  4. **Upgrade Structure**: Pay cost to upgrade (Dwelling → Trading House → Stronghold/Temple → Sanctuary); gain VP if applicable; take Favor tile when building Temple/Sanctuary.
  5. **Send Priest to Cult**: Permanently place Priest to advance 2 or 3 spaces on cult track; gain Power if passing icons; or return Priest to supply to advance 1 space.
  6. **Power Actions**: Spend Power for Bridge, resources, or free Spades (first come, first served; cover with token).
  7. **Special Actions**: Use once per round from Stronghold, Bonus card, or Favor tile (cover with token).
  8. **Pass**: Gain passing bonus from Bonus card, return card, take new one (except Round 6), become starting player.

**Phase III: Cult Bonuses and Clean-up**
- Award cult bonuses from Scoring tile (in next round's order).
- Remove Action tokens from used spaces.
- Add 1 Coin to each unclaimed Bonus card.
- Flip current Scoring tile face-down.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Adjacency**
- **Direct**: Share hex edge or connected by Bridge. Required for town founding, Trading House discount, and power leech.
- **Indirect**: Separated by ≤ Shipping value in river spaces. Sufficient for building and area scoring. Dwarves (Tunneling) and Fakirs (Carpet Flight) create indirect adjacency.

**Power System**
- 12 Power tokens distributed among Bowls I, II, III.
- **Gain Power**: Move from I→II, then II→III. Can sacrifice 1 token from II to move another from II→III.
- **Spend Power**: Move from III→I for Power actions.
- **Power Values**: Dwelling=1, Trading House=2, Temple=2, Stronghold=3, Sanctuary=3.
- **Leech Power**: When opponent builds/ups directly adjacent, gain Power equal to sum of your adjacent Structures' values, at cost of (Power-1) VP (minimum 0).

**Terraforming & Building**
- Transform terrain using Spades (1 per step on cycle; max 3 steps).
- Spades from: Worker exchange, Power actions (1 or 2 free), Bonus card, Favor tiles, faction abilities.
- Build Dwelling on home terrain adjacent to your structure (directly or indirectly).
- Cost: 1 Worker + 2 Coins (varies by faction).

**Town Founding**
- Automatic when 4+ directly adjacent Structures (3 if one is Sanctuary) have combined Power ≥7 (reduced to 6 with "Fire 2" Favor tile).
- Take Town tile: gain VP and one-time benefit (e.g., 1 Priest, 8 Power).
- Each Town provides a "key" to reach space 10 on one cult track.

**Cult Tracks**
- Advance by sending Priests (2 or 3 spaces) or advancing 1 space (returning Priest to supply).
- Gain Power when passing icons: 1 at 3, 2 at 5, 2 at 7, 3 at 10.
- Only one player per space 10; requires one Town per space 10 occupied.
- End-game: 8/4/2 VP for top three on each track.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after Round 6 (no Phase III cult bonuses).

**Final Scoring:**
1. **Cult Scoring**: 8/4/2 VP for highest/second/third on each of 4 cult tracks (ties rounded down).
2. **Area Scoring**: 18/12/6 VP for largest/middle/smallest connected area (directly or indirectly adjacent Structures; ties rounded down).
3. **Resource Conversion**: Convert all resources to Coins (1 VP per 3 Coins; Alchemists: 1 VP per 2 Coins).

Highest total VP wins; ties result in shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Spades from Cult Bonuses (Phase III)**: Can apply to multiple adjacent terrains; cannot spend Workers for more Spades; cannot build Dwellings.
- **Power Gain Limits**: If cannot gain all offered Power, gain what possible and pay VP for that amount.
- **Timing of Effects**: When building/upgrading triggers multiple effects (e.g., Favor tile, Town), resolve opponent Power decisions first.
- **Special Actions**: Must be able to perform effect to take (unlike Power actions).
- **Sacrificing Power**: Can do even if Bowl I is not empty.
- **Faction-Specific Clarifications**:
  - Dwarves: Tunneling costs 2 extra Workers; gain 4 VP per use; Structures connected via Tunneling count for area scoring.
  - Fakirs: Carpet Flight costs 1 extra Priest; gain 4 VP per use; can skip 2 spaces after Stronghold.
  - Mermaids: Can skip one river space when founding Town; place Town tile on river space.
  - Darklings: Pay Priests (not Workers) to transform; gain 2 VP per step.
  - Halflings: Gain 1 VP per Spade used.
