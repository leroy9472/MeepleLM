### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Clank! Negative:** If you gain negative Clank! but have no cubes in Clank area, skip. Can gain positive Clank! later to enable removal.  
- **Healing:** Heal from Health Meter rightmost cube to supply.  
- **Dragon Attacks:** Only triggered once per turn, even if multiple Dragon Attack cards revealed.  
- **Teleport vs Portal:** Teleport ignores all icons; portal costs 1 Boot and allows continued movement.  
- **Wayshrine:** Can mark only once per game; need cube in supply.  
- **Monster Detection:** Always 6 rooms regardless of difficulty.  
- **AI Opponent (Solo Variant):** Uses different movement logic; prioritizes Artifact; gains cards/gold via die roll; returns to Crypt after Artifact acquired.  
- **Quests! Expansion:** Adds quests, Arms & Armor, potions, countryside tiles, tolls. Not part of core game.  
- **Homebrew Expansions (Mummy’s Curse, Gold & Silk):** Add curses, gold nuggets, new market items. Require homemade tokens.
