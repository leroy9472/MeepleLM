### 4. Gameplay Flow
A chapter consists of two parts: Story and Encounter.

#### Story Phase
- Navigate locations using the map and time track.
- Perform checks (e.g., survival, barter) using white MIGHT cards/dice.
- Resolve events, gain clues, trade with Banksmith or Apothecary.
- Complete tasks; rewards are granted based on efficiency (empty time track spaces).
- Proceed to encounter.

#### Encounter Phase (Round Structure)
1. **Refresh Phase** (skip in Round 1 if ambushed):
   - Regenerate animus (REGEN value; companions always gain 2).
   - Retrieve cooldown 0 ability cards.
   - Companions reset archetype card cubes.

2. **Oathsworn Phase**:
   - Players take turns clockwise.
   - On your turn: perform 1 move action and/or play 1 ability card.
   - Play item cards, combat tokens, or special abilities.
   - Injury cards must be played first on your first turn.

3. **Encounter Phase**:
   - Draw and resolve the top stage card.
   - Activate large monsters (movement, attacks, facing).
   - Activate minions in order of proximity to target.
   - Resolve attacks and effects.

4. **End of Round Phase**:
   - Resolve end-of-round effects.
   - Discard "until end of round" cards.

Repeat until the encounter is defeated or all Oathsworn are unconscious.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Combat & Attacks
- **Attack Roll**: Draw MIGHT cards based on MIGHT track cubes + up to 10 white cards.
- **Criticals**: Draw an extra card for each critical symbol; repeat for additional criticals. Blanks from critical draws do not cause failure.
- **Failure**: Drawing 2+ blanks results in a miss (no damage). Triggers Determination Rule: regain spent Redraw/Empowered tokens and gain 1 combat token of choice.
- **Damage**: Total card values. Divide by target’s DEFENSE, round down.
- **Ranged Attacks**: Require Line of Sight (LoS). Trace from closest hex corners; blocked by obstacles, not characters.
- **Large Enemies**: Target closest HP die. Damage reduces die by 1 per full point; remove die at 0.

#### Line of Sight (LoS)
- Between closest corners of attacker and target hex.
- If in a straight line of hexes, use center-to-center.
- Blocked by any obstacle (including corner touch), not by characters.

#### Targeting Priority
1. Character who broke a location (if reaction)
2. Specific target on stage card or special rules
3. Closest Oathsworn in LoS
4. Oathsworn adjacent to enemy with Mob keyword (if attacker has Mob)
5. Rule of North then West (northernmost, then westernmost)

#### Keywords & Special Effects
- **Area of Effect (AoE)**: Affects all in area. For large targets, +1 damage per additional hex beyond first.
- **Battleflow**: After playing an ability card, move all cards in that cooldown position to the next lower position (0 returns to hand).
- **Caged**: Cannot act except pass or attempt escape (3 animus + survival check; +2 per adjacent friendly).
- **Chain Attack**: Targets multiple in sequence. Ignore lowest non-blank die per additional target.
- **Charge Through X**: Move X hexes in straight line, attack all in path.
- **Consumed**: Removed from board; spend 3 animus (1 for companion) to attack once per turn. Freed when location loses 6 HP or all HP dice broken.
- **Crippled**: Cannot move until end of next Oathsworn phase.
- **Empowered**: Upgrade MIGHT cards (white → yellow → red → black) before drawing.
- **Knockback**: Push character away; damage on collision with terrain or character.
- **Mob**: Group of enemies attack as one; total MIGHT used. Targets Oathsworn adjacent to another Mob enemy if tied.
- **Push**: Move character away; if blocked, place in closest unoccupied hex (NW rule).
- **Thrown**: Item placed on adjacent hex. Weapon thrown = unarmed; armor/gear thrown = no DEFENSE or ability.
- **Wave Attack**: 3-hex-wide line; not blocked by obstacles or LoS.

#### Combat Tokens
- **Redraw**: After drawing MIGHT cards, discard one and draw a new one. Can be used multiple times.
- **Empowered x3**: Before drawing, upgrade cards 3 times (e.g., one card +3, or three cards +1).
- **+2 Animus**: Move 2 animus from reserve to available.
- **Battleflow**: Battleflow all cards in one cooldown position.
- **Defense**: After damage is drawn, increase DEFENSE by 1 per token.

*Companions use +2 Animus and Battleflow tokens to: move 2, attack, or refresh MIGHT decks.*

#### Status Tokens
- **Bleed**: Lose HP when triggered.
- **Crippled**: Cannot move until end of next Oathsworn phase.
- **Poison**: Effects as per special rules.
- **Lethality**: Specific to Cur; empowers attacks.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### Defeating the Encounter

2. **Loot**:
   - Gain 3 common items from next chapter.
   - Gain 2 unique items (3 if extra from time track; +1 for Grim, +2 for Dread).
