## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Brazil: Imperial is a strategy game set during the historical development of Brazil across three eras: The Era of Exploration, The Era of Sail, and The Era of Rail. Players take on the roles of imperial leaders aiming to build the most prosperous empire in Terra Brasilis. The objective is to accumulate the most Victory Points (VP) by expanding territory, constructing buildings and cities, completing missions, acquiring paintings, and leveraging unique monarch abilities.

3. **Exploration Tiles**: Shuffle and place face down on all "?" hexes. Return extras to box.
4. **Common Board**:
   - Shuffle and place Combat and Gold card decks.
   - Shuffle City tiles and place face up in two equal stacks.
   - Separate Painting cards into three color decks (red, pink, blue). Reveal 2 from each to form a gallery of 6.
5. **Player Setup**:
   - Each player takes a Player board, matching color pieces (5 Military Units, 5 Palaces, 2 Mansions), and 6 Products (one of each type).
   - Place units, palaces, and products on designated spots.
   - Draw 2 Mission Cards per era (6 total), keep 1 per era, return others to bottom of respective decks.
   - Choose a Monarch board side and place it to the left of the Player board.
6. **Capital Selection**:

7. **Starting Player**: The player who selected the 1st Player tile begins the game. Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of two phases:
1. **Action Phase**: Place your current Era’s Action token on an unoccupied Action Arch to perform that action. You cannot perform the same action two turns in a row with the same token.
2. **Movement Phase**: Perform one free movement with a Military Unit to an adjacent hex. If your Action Arch grants an additional movement, you may use it before or after the free move.

**Era Progression**:
- When a player completes and reveals their current Era’s Mission Card, the game advances to the next Era.
- All players place their previous Era’s Action token face down under an Action Arch of their choice, gaining its bonus permanently.
- All players receive the new Era’s Action token.
- In Era III, revealing a completed Mission triggers the end of the current round and the game.
