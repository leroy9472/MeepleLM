## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the year 2079, after a global nuclear war, only 30,000 survivors remain. Players represent Tribes living in underground shelters, racing to prove their worth to «Convoy», an organization that rescues worthy survivors and relocates them to subaquatic colonies. The game lasts 6 Days (turns), during which players must gather resources, repair shelters, overcome deadly Events, and manage radiation. The Tribe with the most Survival Points (SP) at the end of Day 6 wins and earns evacuation.

The game lasts 6 Days (turns), each divided into three phases:  

#### DAWN  
1. Replenish Resources at each Location:  
   - Forest: 6/8/10 Wood (2/3/4 players)  
   - Mine: 6/8/10 Metal  
   - Fairgrounds: 6/8/10 Microchips

2. Flip next Event Card and apply effect (including lingering Events).  
3. Return Anti-Radiation Algae and Vegetable Tokens to their starting locations.  
4. In each City:  
   - Discard remaining Equipment Tiles; draw 3 new ones face up.  
   - Shuffle Search Tiles + 1 random "Lost In The City" Character Tile; discard others unseen. Reveal Search Tiles face up (6/8/10 based on player count).  
5. Place 1 Survivor on each empty space in the Cargo Ship.  

#### DAY  
In turn order, each player:  
1. Stands up one Idle Hero (lying down).  
2. Moves 1–2 Locations along green arrows.  
   - Must end on a different Location than start.  
   - Cannot stop on a Location occupied by own Hero.  
   - May pass through own Heroes.  
   - May end on opponent’s Location.  
3. On arrival:  
   - If no other Activated Heroes: Hero performs Actions equal to Strength.  
   - If other Activated Heroes present:  
     a. Apply Pressure on weaker Heroes (difference in Strength).  
     b. Defender may spend Ammunition (1 per Pressure point) to reduce tribute.  
     c. If not resisted, aggressor gains 1 Resource (defender’s choice) per Pressure point.  
4. Perform Actions:  
   - Scavenge 1 Resource per Action Point (Wood, Metal, Microchip, Ammunition, Water*).  
   - Hunt: Spend Actions equal to Prey’s Endurance (reducible by Ammunition). Gain Meat based on prior hunts of same type.  
   - Search City: Draw 1 Search Tile per Action; gain Resource/effect.  
   - Collect Equipment: Take 1 face-up Equipment (broken).  
   - Use Location Specials (e.g., Cargo Ship, Dam, Underwater Base).  

#### NIGHT  
1. Lie down all Heroes.  
2. **Overcome Events**: Spend required Resources to discard Event; gain SP at endgame.  
3. **Feed Survivors**:  
   - Pay full Supply cost for each Room with ≥1 Survivor (top-right corner).  
   - Pay 1 Water per Airlock row with ≥1 Survivor.  
   - For each missing Supply, discard 1 Survivor.  
4. **Manage Radioactivity**:  
   - Current turn’s radiation level: Day 1:1, Day 2–4:2, Day 5–6:3.  
   - Each Airlock Survivor prevents 1 point.  
   - Unblocked points move Radioactivity Tracer up.  
   - At level 11+, each extra point kills 1 Survivor.  
5. **Recruit Survivors**: Spend 1 Supply Resource to add 1 Survivor to Airlock (space required).  
6. **Build Rooms**: Spend 3 Material Resources to flip Room to Built. Move Survivors from Airlock to fill. Fully occupied Rooms activate abilities (once per turn).  
7. **Repair Equipment**: Pay cost (top-right) to move Equipment to right of Shelter. Usable once per turn.  
8. **Shelter Upkeep**:  
   - Discard all Meat.  
   - Keep only 2 Water.  
   - Reset used Equipment (flip back).  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Hero States**: Idle (lying) or Activated (standing). Only one per player per Location.  
- **Movement**: 1–2 moves per turn; must change Location.  
- **Pressure**: Activated Hero applies Strength difference to weaker opposing Activated Heroes. Defenders may spend Ammunition to reduce tribute.  
- **Action Limits**: Hero can perform Actions equal to Strength.  
- **Resource Types**:  
  - **Supplies** (Meat, Water, Canned Goods): Used to feed Survivors, recruit.  
  - **Materials** (Wood, Metal, Microchip): Used to build Rooms, repair Equipment.  
  - **Ammunition**: Used to reduce Hunting cost or defend against Pressure.  
- **Room Abilities**: Activated when fully occupied. Used once per turn.  
- **Equipment**: Broken when acquired. Repair to use ability (once per turn). Matching symbols on repaired Equipment yield +1 SP each at endgame.
