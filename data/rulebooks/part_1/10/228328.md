## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Rurik: Dawn of Kiev*, players are princes or princesses vying for the throne of Kievan Rus following the death of Vladimir the Great. The game spans four rounds of strategic maneuvering, where players use troops, advisors, and structures to claim power. Victory is achieved by earning the most victory points (VP) through controlling regions, building adjacent structures, collecting goods, advancing in warfare, fulfilling a secret agenda, and accomplishing deeds.

The player with the most VP wins. Ties are broken first by the number of regions ruled, then by the number of coins. If still tied, players share the title of Grand Prince or Princess.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 4 rounds. Each round has 3 phases:

#### Phase 1: Strategy Phase  
- Players take turns placing one Advisor on the Strategy Board.  
- **Advisor Power**: Higher number = higher placement power.  
- **Advisor Initiative**: Lower number = earlier action in Action Phase.  
- **Placement Rules**:  
  - May not place in a column with your Advisor unless you’ve placed in 3+ different columns.  
  - Empty column: place on top.  
  - Occupied column: bump all Advisors with lower number down; place on highest open space. Ties are not bumped.  
  - May add Coins as bribes (+1 power per Coin, returned before Action Phase).  
  - Full column: cannot place.  

#### Phase 2: Action Phase  
- In turn order, each player resolves their lowest-numbered Advisor.  
- Return any bribes to supply.  
- Take main action (or forfeit for 1 Coin).  
- May take **one of each** bonus action per turn (before/after main action):  
  - Play 1 Scheme Card  
  - Accomplish 1 Deed Card  
  - Use 1 Conversion Token  

**Main Actions (per icon):**  
- **Muster (Helmet)**: Place 1 Troop or Leader from supply into a region you occupy (have ≥1 Troop).  
- **Move (Boot)**: Move 1 Troop to adjacent region. May split points across troops.  
- **Attack (Sword)**: Attack Rebel or Opponent in a region where you have ≥1 Troop.  
  - *Vs. Rebel*: Remove Rebel, gain reward under base.  
  - *Vs. Opponent*: Opponent removes 1 Troop (Leader last). Advance Warfare Marker.  
    - **Casualty Check**:  
      - Reveal 1 Scheme Card (from one deck).  
      - +1 if opponent rules region.  
      - +1 if opponent has Stronghold there.  
      - If Casualty icon appears, remove 1 of your Troops. Discard all revealed cards.  
- **Scheme**: Draw number of Scheme Cards shown, keep 1, return rest to same deck (any order).  
  - Top space: give First Player Marker to any player (including self).  
- **Tax (Cart)**: Collect Goods from occupied regions.  
  - Rule region: 1 Tax point → 1 Good  
  - Not rule: 2 Tax points → 1 Good  
  - Goods go to Boat or Dock. May move freely.  
- **Build (Hammer)**: Build Structure in occupied region.  
  - Rule region: 1 Build point → 1 Structure  
  - Not rule: 2 Build points → 1 Structure  
  - Only 1 of each Structure type per region.  

**Structure Abilities:**  
- **Church**: Remove Rebel (no reward) or opponent’s non-Leader Troop → place 1 of your non-Leader Troops. Counts as Troop for rule. Opponent reveals +1 card on casualty.  
- **Market**: When taxing here, gain 1 extra Good of same type OR 1 Coin.  
- **Stronghold**: Counts as 1 Troop for rule. Opponent reveals +1 card when attacking you here.  

#### Phase 3: Claim Phase  
1. **Advance on Claim Tracks** (never move down):  
   - **Rule**: Move up if you rule required number of regions.  
   - **Build**: Move up if you have structures in required number of adjacent regions.  
   - **Trade**: Move up if you have required number of goods on your Boat.  
2. **Earn Income** (Rounds 1–3 only):  
   - 1 Coin for each Claim/Warfare Marker not on track.  
   - 1 Coin for each fully filled column on your Boat.  
3. **Choose Deed Cards**: In turn order, each player takes 1 from Deed Display. Refill after each choice.  
4. **Refresh Conversion Tokens**: Flip face-up.  
5. **Replenish Goods**: Place matching Good in each region with none.  
6. **Advance Round Marker**: Move forward. If it lands next to Advisors, collect them.  
7. **Intrigue Cards**: From Round 2 onward, activate leftmost Intrigue Card (immediate or ongoing). After Phase 3, discard it.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Ruling a Region**: Have more Troops than each other player and more than Rebels. Leader counts as 1 Troop. Ties → no one rules.  
- **Troop Removal**: Opponent chooses which Troop to remove (Leader last).  
- **Advisor Resolution**: Lowest number first. Ties → choose order.  
- **Bribes**: Increase power during Strategy Phase only. Coins returned before Action Phase.  
- **Bonus Actions**: One per type per turn.  
- **Goods & Boat**: Boat has 5 columns (1 per Good type). Full column = income. Goods may be freely moved between Boat and Dock.  

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After Round 4 Claim Phase:  
- **Claim Tracks**: Score VP based on position on Rule, Build, Trade tracks (1–8 VP each).  
- **Warfare Track**:  
  - 1st place: 3 VP (all ties get 3 VP, no 2nd place awarded)  
  - 2nd place: 1 VP (all ties get 1 VP)  
- **Agenda Card**: 2 VP if goal is met (tied for first/most counts).  
- **Deed Cards**: Score VP as shown (1 or 2 VP each).  

**Winning**: Most VP wins. Tiebreakers:  
1. Most regions ruled  
2. Most coins  
3. Shared victory

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **No Troops on Board**: Before resolving next Advisor, muster Leader + 1 Troop in any region.  
- **Cannot Take Action**: Forfeit for 1 Coin.  
- **Tied Advisors**: Choose which to resolve; other resolves next turn.  
- **Full Scheme Deck**: Shuffle discard pile and other deck to form two new decks.  
- **Leader Abilities**:  
  - *Agatha*: Move up to 2 troops with her for free.  
  - *Boris*: Reveal 1 less card when attacking; steal 1 Coin.  
  - *Maria*: Muster in adjacent unoccupied region once/round.  
  - *Mstislav*: Always costs 1 Tax/Build point in his region.  
  - *Predslava*: Move opponent’s troop for free; they gain 1 Coin.  
  - *Sudislav*: Spend Attack points as Muster points in his region.  
  - *Sviatopolk*: Rebels count as your Troops for rule; defeated Rebel → replace with your Troop.  
  - *Yaroslav*: Win ties for rule; opponents’ structures lose abilities in his region.  
- **Intrigue Variants**: 3 cards revealed; activate leftmost at start of Rounds 2–4. Effects vary (e.g., bribes cost Coins, bonuses).  
- **Deed Row Variant**: After last player chooses, discard row and refill 3 new cards.
