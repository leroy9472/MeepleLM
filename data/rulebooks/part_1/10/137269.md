## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In Victorian England, the discovery of Spyrium—a powerful mineral—revolutionizes industry. Players lead industrial conglomerates, competing to build factories, patent techniques, and employ key characters to earn Victory Points (VP). The player with the most VP after 6 turns wins.  

### 2. Components  
- Market Cards (Periods A, B, C)  
- Event Cards  
- Blue Numbered Tokens (1, 2, or 3)  
- Player Start Cards  
- Player Discs (4 per player): 3 for track markers, 1 to mark event use  
- Workers (7 per player): 3 start in hand, 4 beside board  
- Spyrium Crystals (unlimited supply)  
- Money (£, unlimited)  
- Bonus Tokens (2 per player): one for £5, one for extra worker  
- Score Track  
- Residence Track  
- Phase I/II Board Areas  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Sort & Shuffle Decks**:  
   - Separate Market Cards into Period A (turns 1–3), B (turns 4–5), C (turn 6); shuffle each into face-down decks.  
   - Shuffle Event Cards into a face-up deck placed on “Future Event” space.  
2. **Tokens**:  
   - Shuffle blue numbered tokens (1/2/3) and place face-down beside board.  
   - If top Event Card uses a token, place a random one face-up on it.  
3. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player chooses a color and places:  
     - 1 disc on 0 of Score Track  
     - 1 disc on space #2 (first space) of Residence Track  
     - 1 disc on Phase I area  
   - Receives:  
     - 1 Start Card  
     - 3 Workers (placed on Start Card)  
     - 2 Spyrium  
     - £8  
     - 4th disc (to mark event use)  
   - Remaining 4 Workers placed beside board (inactive).  
4. **Bonus Tokens**:  
   - Place both Bonus Tokens (worker and £5) of each player’s color next to space 8 on Score Track.  
   - When a player reaches 8 VP, they choose one bonus; the unused token moves to space 20.  
5. **Bank**:  
   - Place unlimited £ and Spyrium beside board.  
6. **First Player**:  
   - Randomly choose; give First Player Card.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows this sequence:  

#### **Beginning of Turn**  
1. **Revenue**: Each player gains £ equal to current Residence Track position.  
2. **Event Reveal**:  
   - Move top card from Future Event deck to Turn’s Event space.  
   - Reveal next Future Event card.  
   - If new Turn’s Event or revealed Future Event uses a token, place a random blue token face-up on it.  
3. **Market Setup**:  
   - Draw 9 cards from current period’s deck in 3×3 grid.  
   - Place tokens:  
     - 1 blue token on each Building or Technique card with Token symbol  
     - (Players − 1) tokens on each Character card with Token symbol  
4. **Reactivate Workers**: All players place their available workers on their Start Card (active).  
5. **Reset Phase**: Move all players’ phase discs to Phase I.  

#### **Action Phase (Clockwise from First Player)**  
Players take turns performing **one action per turn**, until all pass.  

##### **Phase I – Placement (Available Actions)**  
Choose one:  
- **Place Worker**: Place 1 worker from Start Card into the market **between two adjacent cards** or between a card and an empty edge space. Multiple workers allowed in same gap.  
- **Use Turn’s Event**: Place your 4th disc on Event Card to claim **one** of its effects. Can only be used once per turn.  
- **Proceed to Phase II**: Move your phase disc to Phase II area and immediately perform any Phase II action.  

##### **Phase II – Activation (Available Actions)**  
Choose one:  
- **Gain Money**:  
  - Remove one of your workers from the market.  
  - Choose one adjacent card. Gain £1 from bank **for each worker (any player)** still adjacent to that card.  
  - If both adjacent cards are gone, gain nothing.  
  - Place removed worker beside Start Card (inactive).  
- **Activate Card**:  
  - Remove one of your workers adjacent to a market card.  
  - Pay:  
    - £ cost shown in upper-right corner of card  
    - £1 for each other worker adjacent to the card  
  - Then resolve card type:  
    - **Character**: Take immediate effect. If card has tokens, use one (choose which), then discard token. Card remains in market.  
    - **Building**: Take card and place to **right of Start Card**.  
      - **New Space**: Pay £1 per building already owned (first space free).  
      - **Replace Any Building**: Discard old, no space cost.  
      - **Replace Matching Symbol**: Discard old, no space cost, **reduce building cost by £3** (min £0).  
      - Take any immediate effect (e.g., VP token, residence bonus).  
    - **Technique (Patent)**: Take card and place to **left of Start Card**. No space or ownership cost.  
- **Use Turn’s Event**: Same as in Phase I. Cannot use if already used.  
- **Use Own Building**:  
  - Choose a non-inclined (vertical) building.  
  - Incline (turn horizontal) to use once this turn.  
  - Pay any cost (Spyrium/workers) shown.  
  - Take one effect shown.  
  - Workers used are placed beside Start Card (inactive).  
- **Pass**: Only allowed if **no workers remain in market**. Once passed, player takes no more actions this turn.  

#### **End of Turn**  
When all players have passed:  
- Discard all Market cards and tokens.  
- Return Event Card to discard; retrieve all player discs from it.  
- Straighten (untap) all inclined buildings and techniques.  
- Pass First Player Card to the left.  
- Begin next turn.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### **Residence Track**  
- Players earn £ at start of turn equal to position.  
- Some cards grant **Residence Effect**: move up 1 space **or** gain VP equal to current position.  

#### **Tokens (Blue Circles)**  
- Used on certain Market and Event cards.  
- Values: 1, 2, or 3.  
- Draw randomly from face-down reserve when needed.  
- Discarded tokens go to a discard pile; reshuffle when reserve empty.  
- Characters with (Players − 1) tokens can be activated that many times.  

#### **Techniques (Patents)**  
- Permanent upgrades. Cannot be lost.  
- Provide ongoing effects and end-game VP (max 7 VP per technique).  
- Examples:  
  - **Crane**: Pay £3 less when building in new space; 1 VP per building at end.  
  - **Commerce**: Keep blue tokens from activated cards; 1 VP per kept token at end.  
  - **Lobbying**: Once per turn, activate a card without paying adjacent worker costs.  
  - **Taylorism**: Once per turn, reuse an inclined building.  

#### **Event Cards**  
- One per turn. Any player may use it once by placing disc.  
- Effects (examples):  
  - Trade 1 Spyrium for Residence bonus  
  - Gain £, Spyrium, or VP equal to face-up token value  
  - Pay £1 to straighten one inclined building  
  - Pay £1 per owned worker to gain a new worker  
  - In Phase II, place a worker directly into market  
  - Trade 1/3 Spyrium for £3/£6  
  - Trade £3/£6 for 3/5 VP  

#### **Buildings**  
- Score VP at end of game (value in top-left).  
- Types:  
  - **Mine**: Use with workers to gain Spyrium.  
  - **Factory/Workshop/Lab**: Use with workers + Spyrium for VP.  
  - **University**: VP = value of token taken at construction.  
  - **Residence**: Immediate Residence bonus when built.  
  - **Neighborhood**: Gain 1–2 extra workers (immediately active).  
  - **Luxury Home/Mansion/Palace**: VP only; no effect.  
- Can be replaced; matching symbol gives £3 discount.  

#### **Characters**  
- One-time effects when activated.  
- Examples:  
  - **Geologist**: Gain 2 Spyrium  
  - **Apprentice**: Pay 1 Spyrium → 3 VP  
  - **Engineer**: Pay 1 Spyrium → 4 VP  
  - **Banker**: Pay token value → 3 VP  
  - **Miner**: Gain Spyrium = token value  
  - **Architect**: Pay token value → Residence bonus  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after **Turn 6**. Final scoring:  
- **Money, Spyrium, Workers**: Worth nothing.  
- **Buildings**: VP shown in top-left corner. **Replaced buildings score 0**.  
- **Techniques (Patents)**: Up to **7 VP each**, based on objectives met (e.g., number of buildings, workers used, etc.).  
- **Commerce Technique**: 1 VP per blue token kept on activated Market cards.  
- **Bonus Tokens**:  
  - At **8 VP**: Choose £5 or extra worker (place on Start Card).  
  - At **20 VP**: Receive the other bonus.  

**Win Condition**: Most VP wins. **No tiebreaker**.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use the same building twice in one turn?**  
  Only if you have Taylorism or an Event allows it. Normally, buildings incline after use.  
- **Can I use Turn’s Event in both Phase I and II?**  
  No. Only once per turn per player.  
- **What if I run out of workers?**  
  You can still gain workers via Neighborhood buildings or Events.  
- **Can I activate a card with no workers adjacent?**  
  Yes, if you place a worker there first (in Phase I).  
- **Do replaced buildings count for technique scoring?**  
  No. Only buildings in your neighborhood at game end count.  
- **Can I pass with workers still on Start Card?**  
  Yes, but only if **no workers are in the market**. Workers on Start Card but not in market do not prevent passing.
