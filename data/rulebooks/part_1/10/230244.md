# Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Humanity has ruined Earth and launched the Black Angel, an interstellar ark carrying human genetic heritage. Multiple AIs (players) compete to earn the most Validation Points (VP) by managing resources, technology, and alien relations. The AI with the most VP when the Black Angel reaches planet Spes (or the Ravager deck is exhausted) wins.

2. Components  
- 1 Black Angel gameboard with 6 action spaces (2 per color: orange, gray, green)  
- 4 player boards (2–4 players)  
- 7 double-sided Space strips forming the Space board  
- 1 Black Angel figurine and 1 Planet Spes token/tile  
- 18 dice (6 per color: orange, gray, green)  
- 20 ship figurines  
- 64 robots (16 per player)  
- 12 Starting Technology tiles (3 per player)  
- 48 standard Technology tiles (16 per color)  
- 16 Advanced Technology tiles  
- 60 Mission cards (20 per color)  
- 30 Ravager cards  
- 40 resources, 30 Damage/Debris cubes  
- Player discs, score track, First Player token  
- 12 Hal cards (solitaire variant)  
- Player aids

3. Setup  
- Place Black Angel board in center; sort dice by color into supply areas (4 per color for 2p, 5 for 3p, 6 for 4p).  
- Arrange 5 (2p/1p) or 7 (3p/4p) Space strips in a chevron toward the board. Place Spes token on furthest strip.  
- Place Black Angel figurine on middle hex of center strip.  
- Shuffle and place 3 face-up stacks of standard Technology tiles (by color), standard side up. Draw 1 of each color to fill first 3 spaces of display (2 cost-2, 1 cost-1).  
- Shuffle Advanced Technology tiles face down; place 4 face up on board.  
- Form 3 Mission card decks (by color), shuffle separately.  
- Shuffle Ravager deck; remove 12 cards (2p/1p), 6 cards (3p), 0 (4p). Draw 2 Ravager cards, place each on its target action (1–6), adding 1 Damage cube to first empty space.  
- Each player:  
  - Choose color; take player board, 2 discs, 8 robots.  
  - Place 1 disc on 5 VP; 2nd disc on nearest compartment.  
  - Place 1 robot in each workstation; 5 in break room.  
  - Randomly place 3 Starting Technology tiles on highlighted grid spaces.  
  - Draw 1 Mission card of each color and 1 Ravager card.  
  - Place 1 resource, 1 debris, 1 ship in storage.  
  - Roll 1 die per color; place in compartment.  
- 2p: Assign idle player color; place 1 robot per workstation; roll dice for its compartment.  
- 1p: Assign Hal color; place Hal’s disc on VP track (based on difficulty); place 1 robot per workstation; roll Hal’s dice. Shuffle Hal’s card deck gray-side up.  
- Choose first player; distribute player aids clockwise; first player takes P1 token. Apply starting bonuses (e.g., P3/P4 may reserve a die for free).

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, choose one sequence:  
A. Action Sequence  
B. Reboot Sequence  

If unable to do A, must do B. In final round, may pass instead.

**Sequence A: Action Sequence**  
1. **Play a card (optional):**  
   - Place 1 Mission or Ravager card face down on a slot around your tech grid.  
   - Mission card: activates same-color tiles in row/column.  
   - Ravager card: activates all tiles in row/column.  
   - Activate tiles in any order. Only standard-side-up tiles can be activated. Advanced tiles never activate.  

2. **Perform an action with 1 die:**  
   - Choose die from your compartment or another player’s (pay 1 resource; cannot buy reserved dice).  
   - May spend 1 debris to flip your own die to opposite face (cannot flip bought dice).  
   - Use die on Black Angel board or Space board.  
   - Die value = number of activations. Must use at least 1 activation.  

   **On Black Angel board:**  
   - Match die color to action.  
   - If action has 2 Damage cubes, die value reduced by 1 (min 0).  
   - If Ravager card present, resolve topmost permanent effect before action. If cannot, still perform action but lose 1 VP.  
   - Actions:  
     - **Discover Technology:** 1 activation = take 1 standard tile (cost 1). 2 activations = take 1 cost-2 tile or 1 Advanced tile.  
       - Advanced tiles immediately replaced.  
       - Inject new tiles into grid following arrow direction; shift/eject existing tiles.  
       - Ejected debris returned to storage.  
     - **Repair Black Angel:** 1 activation = remove 1 Damage cube (from action or die). Convert to debris.  
       - Place debris on Lightning space of a tech tile to activate it, or in storage.  
     - **Destroy Ravagers:** 1 activation = destroy 1 Ravager card. All cards in same location must be destroyed together.  
     - **Command Your Ships:**  
       1. Move 1 ship ≤ die value hexes. Cannot enter asteroid hex unless Black Angel is there. Max 2 ships per hex (different players).  
       2. If die color matches hex and ship ends there, may place matching-color Mission card.  
          - Must place 1 robot from break room on card’s bonus to claim it.  
          - Tuck card under ship.  
       3. **Ravagers appear:** Count Ravager Ship icons on adjacent hexes. For each:  
          - Draw Ravager card; place on indicated action.  
          - Add Damage cube: first to action (1→2), then to same-color supply die (if available), else ignore.  
          - Max 3 Ravager cards per action; if full, discard and draw new.  
       4. **New Tech tiles appear:** Add 1–2 tiles (per card) to display in order, pushing existing tiles.  

   **On Space board (Activation Mission cards only):**  
   - Must have robot or ship on card.  
   - Use die of same color as card.  
   - 1 activation = apply card effect once.  
   - Owner of card (not you) gets 1 free activation after yours.  

3. **Draw card and return die:**  
   - Draw 1 Mission card matching die’s original color; add to hand.  
   - Advanced rules: draw 2, keep 1, discard other.  
   - Return die to supply.  
   - Hand limit: 6 Mission cards. Discard excess.

**Sequence B: Reboot Sequence**  
1. **Reroll dice:**  
   - Lose VP equal to total pips on dice in your compartment (including high-security). Return all dice to supply.  
   - For each robot in a workstation, take 1 die of matching color from supply (if available).  
     - If die is damaged (has Damage cube), lose 1 VP; return cube to supply.  
   - Roll new dice; place in compartment.  
   - Optionally, spend 1 resource to reserve 1 die (move to high-security area).  
   - 2p: Also reroll idle player’s dice if used or showing star.  

2. **Reset player board:**  
   - Discard all cards from around tech grid.  
   - Return all debris from tech tiles to storage.  

3. **Advance Black Angel:**  
   - Move figurine 1 hex away from board along Space strips.  
   - Eject all cards from first (closest) strip.  
     - Neutralization Mission cards: resolve “upon ejection” effects.  
     - All ejected cards: return to owners; tuck under same-color slot on player board.  
     - Return robots and ships to supply.  
   - Flip first strip over; place at far end; shift all strips toward board.  
   - If Spes token was on ejected strip: remove token, cover middle hex of flipped strip with Spes tile.  
   - If Black Angel lands on Spes hex: trigger endgame after current round.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Technology Tiles:**  
  - Standard side: one-time effects when activated (e.g., gain VP, ship, move ship, activate adjacent tile).  
  - Boost side (advanced): “1×” effects used once when performing matching action (e.g., set die to 3, change die color, gain 2 VP). Flip to standard side after use.  
- **Advanced Technology Tiles:** Scored at game end. Effects:  
  - 2 VP per tech tile of color in grid.  
  - 2 VP per ejected tech/debris in storage/Ravager in hand.  
  - 2 VP per Advanced tile in grid or ejected.  
  - 2 VP per card you own in Space.  
  - Max 4 VP per non-ejected or overflow-ejected Advanced tile.  
  - Ejected tiles in 3 dedicated spaces: base 4 VP + 2 VP per matching-color card tucked under.  
- **Mission Cards:**  
  - Activation: used via die on Space board.  
  - Neutralization: trigger “upon ejection” when Sequence B advances Black Angel.  
- **Ravager Cards:**  
  - When placed: inflict 1 damage.  
  - Permanent effects (top card only):  
    - Place Damage on next action clockwise.  
    - Place Damage on specific-color supply die.  
    - Discard Mission card to act.  
    - Discard Ravager card to act.  
    - Place 1 robot on card (returned when Ravager destroyed).  
- **Debris:** Spend 1 to flip your die. Use to activate tech tiles.  
- **Storage:** Ships, resources, debris stored on player board. Robots stored in break room.  
- **Ejection:** Cards on first strip ejected when Black Angel advances. Cards tucked under player board count for scoring.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Endgame triggered when:  
- Black Angel reaches Spes hex (during Sequence B).  
- Ravager deck is exhausted (during Sequence A).  
Finish current round, then play one final round. After final round:  
- Final scoring:  
  - VP from track.  
  - Advanced Technology tiles:  
    - In dedicated spaces: 4 VP + 2 VP per matching-color card tucked under.  
    - Elsewhere: max 4 VP each.  
  - If Black Angel on Spes: convert robots (break room), resources, ships (storage) to VP at 2:1 (total all, divide by 2, round down).  
- Highest VP wins. Tie: shared victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Robots:** Must come from break room. Cannot use supply robots.  
- **Mission card placement:** Only via Command Ships action. Must match die and hex color. Hex must be empty.  
- **Activating cards:** Cannot activate immediately after placing. Requires future turn.  
- **Die flipping:** Can flip own die with debris. Cannot flip bought die.  
- **Multiple activations:** Not required to use all. Must use at least one.  
- **Ravager effects:** Only top card matters. If cannot resolve, lose 1 VP but still act.  
- **Endgame:** After trigger, Black Angel stops advancing. Sequence B skips B.3 (no ejection).  
- **Hal (solitaire):**  
  - Gains VP instead of components.  
  - On turn: if dice, performs Action Sequence based on top card (A: top first; B: bottom first).  
  - If no dice, performs Reboot.  
  - When his card ejected, gains 3 VP.  
  - Always maximizes VP.  
  - Final scoring: Hal does not score endgame VP.
