## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
ZERTZ is the third game in Kris Burm’s Project GIPF series. It is a two-player abstract strategy game centered on sacrifice, spatial control, and forced captures. The objective is to be the first player to collect one of the following sets of marbles:  
- 2 marbles of each color (white, grey, black)  
- 3 white marbles  
- 4 grey marbles  
- 5 black marbles  

The game features a shrinking board and shared marbles, creating dynamic tension as players manipulate both placement and isolation to gain advantage.

### 2. Components  
- 6 white marbles  
- 8 grey marbles  
- 10 black marbles  
- 37 round board pieces (used to form hexagonal board)  
- 1 rulebook  

*Note: The game also includes ZERTZ-potentials (bonus components for use with GIPF), but these are not used in standalone ZERTZ play.*

### 3. Setup  
1. **Marble Pool**: Place 5 white, 7 grey, and 9 black marbles into a shared pool. (The extra 1 of each color is reserved for the tournament version.)  
2. **Board Assembly**: Arrange the 37 board pieces into a hexagonal shape (7 rings across). All pieces must be connected at the start.  
3. **Determine First Player**: Decide randomly or by mutual agreement who goes first.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On each turn, a player must choose **one** of the following two actions:

#### A. Place a Marble and Remove a Board Piece  
1. **Place a Marble**: Select any marble (white, grey, or black) from the pool and place it on any vacant board piece.  
   - Marbles are shared; neither player owns specific colors.  
2. **Remove a Board Piece**: After placing the marble, remove one **free** board piece.  
   - A "free" piece is:  
     - Vacant (no marble on it)  
     - Located at the edge of the board (can be removed without disturbing other pieces)  
   - If no free edge piece can be removed, skip this step.  
   - Removed board pieces are set aside and used later to hold captured marbles.  
   - This entire action (place + remove) counts as one complete turn.

#### B. Capture One or More Marbles  
1. **Capturing is compulsory** if possible.  
2. To capture:  
   - Jump over an adjacent marble with another marble.  
   - There must be a vacant board piece directly behind the jumped marble in a straight line.  
   - Jumps can be made in any of the six hexagonal directions.  
3. **Jumping Rules**:  
   - Any marble can jump over any other marble, regardless of color or who placed it.  
   - Multiple jumps in a single turn are **mandatory** if available (continuing from the landing spot).  
   - You may choose which capture sequence to take if multiple options exist (e.g., capture 1 vs. 2 marbles).  
4. **After capture**:  
   - The captured marble(s) are taken from the board and kept by the capturing player.  
   - No marble is placed from the pool this turn.  
   - No board piece is removed.  
   - The turn ends after all mandatory jumps are completed.

#### C. Isolating Marbles (Passive Capture)  
- If a move causes one or more **occupied** board pieces to become disconnected from the main board and contain **no vacant spaces**, the player may claim:  
  - All marbles on the isolated group  
  - The board pieces themselves  
- This capture occurs **as a result of a move**, not as a separate action.  
- It is **not compulsory**.  
- Example: Removing a connecting board piece isolates a single occupied piece → claim that marble.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Shared Marbles**: All marbles belong to both players; any color can be selected from the pool or used for captures.  
- **Board Shrinking**: The board gradually shrinks as edge pieces are removed, increasing tension and limiting space.  
- **Forced Captures**: If a capture is possible at the start of your turn, you must make it (and complete all possible jumps).  
- **No Pool? Use Captured Marbles**:  
  - If the pool is empty, you may use your **own captured marbles** as the source for placement.  
  - You may choose any color from your captured stock.  
- **Jumping Mechanics**:  
  - Like checkers: jump over adjacent marble to vacant spot behind.  
  - Multiple jumps required if continuation is possible.  
  - Direction may change between jumps.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when a player achieves **one** of the following:  
- 2 white, 2 grey, and 2 black marbles  
- 3 white marbles  
- 4 grey marbles  
- 5 black marbles  

**Special Cases**:  
- If the **pool is empty** and no one has won, continue using captured marbles.  
- If **all board pieces are occupied** before a win:  
  - The player who made the **last move** wins.  
  - This player captures all remaining marbles (the entire board is treated as an isolated group).  

The first player to meet a winning condition **wins immediately**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I skip capturing if I want to place a marble instead?**  
A: No. Capturing is **compulsory** if possible. You cannot choose to place a marble if a capture is available.

**Q: What if I place a marble that creates a capture for my opponent?**  
A: Your opponent **must** capture on their turn if the opportunity exists.

**Q: Can I remove a board piece that isolates a group?**  
A: Yes. If the isolated group has **no empty spaces** and contains marbles, you may claim them immediately.

**Q: What happens if I can’t remove a board piece after placing a marble?**  
A: You still complete your turn. Just placing the marble is sufficient. This typically happens when no edge pieces are vacant.

**Q: Can I capture using a marble I just placed?**  
A: No. You place the marble and remove a board piece — that’s your turn. You cannot capture the same turn you place a marble unless the capture was already available before your move.

**Q: Can I win by isolating marbles?**  
A: Yes. If the isolation gives you enough marbles to meet a winning condition, you win immediately.
