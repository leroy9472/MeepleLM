### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of four phases in order: **Green (Worker)**, **Yellow (Market)**, **Blue (Building)**, **Red (Noble)**.  
Each phase proceeds as follows:

#### A. Phase Start  
- Refill top row to 8 cards (10 if Market in play) from current phase’s deck.  
- Starting player (holds phase symbol) begins turn order.

#### B. Player Turns (in clockwise order)  
On your turn, choose **one** action:  
- **Buy a card** from display (pay cost with discounts)  
- **Take a card into hand** (free, max 3 cards unless Warehouse or Event used)  
- **Buy a card from hand** (pay as if from top row)  
- **Pass** (skip rest of phase)  

Passing does not affect turn order; play continues until all players pass consecutively.

  - −1 Ruble if buying from bottom row  
  - −1 Ruble per already-played card with same name

  - Ties: All tied for 1st score 1st-place points; no 2nd
