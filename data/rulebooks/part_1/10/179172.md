## 4. Gameplay Flow (per round)
**1. Events Step**
- Each player draws 1 Event card.
- Starting player reveals top City card; all follow instructions.
- Players take turns playing 1 Event card or passing. Play continues until all pass consecutively.

**2. Park Step**
- Players alternate taking 3 actions each (one at a time):
  - **Take**: Get a card via:
    - Take 1 from Market into hand
    - Draw 2 from Park/Event/Blueprint deck, keep 1
    - Discard 1 from hand → draw 5 Park cards, keep 1
  - **Build**: Pay cost to place Park/Showcase card:
    - Attractions go in leftmost empty space
    - Upgrades tuck under suitable attraction
    - Staff/Resources go left of Gate
    - Super attractions require ≥5 stars in park
  - **Demolish**: Remove 1 Park/Showcase card:
    - Removes all upgrades if attraction
    - Demolished cards go to discard (Showcase removed from game)
  - **Loose Change**: Gain 1 coin per attraction (open or closed)

**3. Guests Step**
- Count stars from open cards (attractions, upgrades, staff, resources, Gate)
- Cap total by guest capacity (base: 15)
- Income = guest count × base rate (usually 1 coin/guest) + ticket abilities

**4. Cleanup Step**
- Discard pinned Event cards
- Reopen all closed attractions
- Clear and refill Market
- Discard down to 5 cards in hand (Park + Event)
- Advance Starting Player marker

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Attractions**: Max 5 per park (incl. 1 super attraction). Built left-to-right. Cannot move after placement.
- **Upgrades**: Built on attractions. No duplicate names per attraction. Built-in upgrades count toward size/scoring but not abilities.
- **Hand Limit**: 5 Park + Event cards. Enforced in Cleanup.
- **Event Cards**: Two-part choices (top/bottom). Choose one effect. Some have types (Injunction, Inspection, Intrusion) that can be blocked.
- **Blocking**: Use defensive cards (e.g., Security Guards vs Intrusion) immediately when attacked.
- **Pinned Events**: Marked with pushpin; last until Cleanup.
- **City Deck**: 8 cards (4 Funfair → 4 Unfair). Final City card signals last round.
- **Blueprint Access**: Only during first 4 rounds via Park action. After that, only via specific cards.
- **Loans**: Take anytime (no action). Gain 5 coins per loan. Costs points at end (1 loan = -1 point).
- **Scoring Elements**:
  - Attraction Size: Points based on icon count (see scoring table)
  - Blueprints: Complete requirements → gain points; fail → -10 each
  - Coins: 2 coins = 1 VP
  - Other: Staff/resources score points as marked
  - Loans: Subtract points as marked

## 6. Scoring & End Game
When final City card is played, finish the round and score:
1. **Attractions**: For each attraction, count all icons (main card + all upgrades + built-ins). Score based on total:
   - 1 icon: 1 pt, 2: 3 pts, 3: 6 pts, 4: 10 pts, 5: 15 pts, 6: 21 pts, 7: 28 pts, 8: 36 pts, 9: 45 pts, 10: 55 pts, 11: 66 pts, 12: 76 pts, 13: 87 pts, 14: 99 pts, 15+: 112 pts
2. **Blueprints**: Reveal all. Score printed value if requirements met. -10 if not. Bonus sections optional (no penalty).
3. **Coins**: 1 VP per 2 coins.
4. **Other**: Add points from staff, resources, etc.
5. **Loans**: Subtract points equal to number taken.
6. **Tiebreaker**: 
   - Highest star total
   - Most completed blueprints
   - Most coins
   - Most Unfair merchandise worn
   - Rock/Paper/Scissors
