## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Jekyll vs Hyde is a two-player trick-taking game based on Robert Louis Stevenson's novella. One player assumes the role of Dr. Jekyll, striving to maintain balance and resist transformation. The other plays Mr. Hyde, aiming to dominate Jekyll’s identity. The game spans up to three rounds. Mr. Hyde wins if the Identity Marker reaches the final space on the track. If not, Dr. Jekyll wins after the third round.

2. Components  
- 21 Evil Cards: 3 suits (Wrath/red, Greed/green, Pride/purple), values 1–7  
- 4 Potion Cards: numbered 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+ (the "+" indicates a value "and a half")  
- 1 Game Board with Identity Track (10 spaces, Jekyll on right, Hyde on left)  
- 1 Identity Marker  
- 3 Suit Tokens (one per suit, used to track suit rankings)  

3. Setup  
- Choose roles: one player is Dr. Jekyll, the other is Mr. Hyde.  
- Place the board between players.  
- Place the Identity Marker on the first (rightmost) space — Dr. Jekyll’s domain.  
- Place the three Suit Tokens near the board.  
- Shuffle all 25 cards (21 Evil + 4 Potion).  
- Mr. Hyde deals 10 cards to each player.  
- The remaining 5 cards are set aside (not used until reshuffle).  
- Dr. Jekyll leads the first trick (since the marker starts in Jekyll’s domain).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:  
1. Preparation (card exchange)  
2. Trick-Taking (10 tricks)  
3. Progression of Evil (scoring and movement)  

Repeat for up to three rounds unless Hyde wins early.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Preparation Phase**  
- Round 1: Each player exchanges 1 card with opponent (simultaneously).  
- Round 2: Exchange 2 cards.  
- Round 3: Exchange 3 cards.  
- If a player holds 2 or more Potion Cards at the start of a round, they must include at least one in the exchange.  

**Trick-Taking Rules**  
- The starting player leads the first trick. Determined by Identity Marker:  
  - If on Jekyll’s side (right), Jekyll leads.  
  - If on Hyde’s side (left), Hyde leads.  
- First round: Jekyll always leads.  
- To lead:  
  - May play any card (suited or Potion).  
  - If a suited card is led, opponent must follow suit if able.  
    - May instead play a Potion Card even if they have the suit.  
    - If unable to follow suit, may play any card.  
  - If a Potion Card is led:  
    - The lead player names a suit.  
    - Opponent must play a card of that suit if they have one.  
    - If they don’t, they may play any card (including another Potion).  

**Determining Trick Winner**  
- If both cards are same suit: higher number wins.  
- If different suits: higher-ranked suit wins (regardless of number).  
- If a Potion is played:  
  - Resolve the Potion effect first.  
  - Then, higher number wins (Potions are ranked: 2+ > 2, 2+ < 3, etc.).  
- If both players play Potions:  
  - Effects cancel (no effect).  
  - Higher Potion value wins.  

**Suit Ranking (Dynamic per Round)**  
- No fixed suit order. Determined during play:  
  - First suit played becomes lowest-ranked.  
  - Second suit played becomes middle-ranked.  
  - Remaining suit becomes highest-ranked.  
- Use Suit Tokens to track current rankings on the board.  
- Potion Cards do not affect suit ranking.  

**Potion Effects** (based on opponent’s card or called suit)  
- Played onto or against a **Pride (purple)** card:  
  - Winner takes one trick (2 cards) from opponent’s won pile.  
- Played onto or against a **Greed (green)** card:  
  - Both players simultaneously exchange 2 cards from hand (1 if only one card left).  
- Played onto or against a **Wrath (red)** card:  
  - Remove all Suit Tokens from board.  
  - Reset suit rankings: next suit played becomes lowest, etc.  
- If a Potion is led and opponent cannot follow the named suit:  
  - Effect is based on the suit actually played in response.  
- If opponent plays a Potion in response to a Potion lead:  
  - No effect; highest Potion wins.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After 10 tricks, count tricks won by each player.  
- Calculate the gap: |Jekyll tricks − Hyde tricks|.  
- Move the Identity Marker toward Hyde’s side (left) by that many spaces.  
- If the marker reaches the last (leftmost) space at any point:  
  - Mr. Hyde wins immediately.  
- If not, proceed to next round:  
  - Remove Suit Tokens.  
  - Reshuffle all 25 cards (including set-aside 5).  
  - Repeat setup and exchange for next round.  
- After third round:  
  - If marker has not reached the final space, Dr. Jekyll wins.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can the Identity Marker move backward?**  
  No. Movement is always toward Hyde (left). Only the gap size matters, not who won more tricks.  
- **What if a player has only one card during a Greed Potion effect?**  
  Each player exchanges one card.  
- **Does leading a Potion and opponent failing to follow the named suit trigger the Potion effect?**  
  Yes, but the effect is based on the suit the opponent actually played.  
- **What happens if both players play Potions?**  
  No effect. Higher Potion value wins.  
- **Is the + value used only for winning tricks?**  
  Yes. Potion values are compared as 2.5, 3.5, etc., only for determining trick winner.  
- **When does the game end?**  
  Immediately if the Identity Marker reaches the last space. Otherwise, after the third round.
