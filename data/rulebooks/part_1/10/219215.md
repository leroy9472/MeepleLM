## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The village is under threat from Werewolves. The Mayor has discovered a Magic Word that can banish them—but he is now mute, able to communicate only through tokens. The Seer knows the word but must remain hidden. The Werewolves also know the word and will do anything to prevent the villagers from guessing it.  

**Objective**:  
- **Village Team (Mayor, Seer, Villagers)**: Discover the Magic Word during the Day Phase OR correctly identify the Werewolf(s) if the word is not guessed.  
- **Werewolf Team (Werewolf(s))**: Prevent the word from being guessed, OR—if the word *is* guessed—correctly identify the Seer.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Determine Roles**:  
   - 4–6 players: 1 Werewolf, 1 Seer, 1 Mayor, rest Villagers (total cards = players + 1)  
   - 7–11 players: 2 Werewolves, 1 Seer, 1 Mayor, rest Villagers  
   - 12+ players: 3 Werewolves, 1 Seer, 1 Mayor, rest Villagers  

2. **Deal Cards**:  
   - Shuffle all role cards.  
   - Deal one card face down to each player.  
   - Place one card face down in the center.  

3. **Mayor Setup**:  
   - The player with the Mayor card reveals it.  
   - That player takes the center card and looks at it secretly—this is their secret role.  
   - Place the token box in front of the Mayor.  
   - Position the mobile device near the Mayor but accessible to all.  

> If no one has the Mayor card, the player to the left of the last Mayor takes the center card (which is the Mayor card), reveals it, and proceeds. For the first game, re-deal until someone gets the Mayor.

4. **App Setup**:  
   - Open the Werewords app.  
   - Select roles (Mayor is always in play; others selected via square frame).  
   - Set player count (leftmost button above Play).  
   - Choose difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert).  
   - Adjust game timer (default 4 minutes; tap and hold to change).  
   - Optional: Use custom, community, or category word lists (via Gear button).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

#### Night Phase (App-Controlled)  
1. Mayor taps **Play** on app.  
2. All players close eyes.  
3. App prompts **Mayor** to wake up and tap secret role (e.g., Villager, Seer, Werewolf).  
4. Mayor selects Magic Word from 3–4 options (app displays).  
5. App confirms word to Mayor, then tells Mayor to close eyes.  
6. App prompts **Seer** to wake up; Seer sees the Magic Word, then closes eyes.  
7. App prompts **Werewolf(s)** to wake up; each sees the Magic Word and (if multiple) sees identity of other Werewolf(s).  
8. All players wake up. Day Phase begins.  

#### Day Phase  
- App starts timer (default 4 minutes).  
- Players take turns asking the Mayor **yes/no questions** about the Magic Word.  
- Mayor responds **only** with tokens:  
  - Yes (☑) / No (✗)  
  - Maybe (?)  
  - So Close (☑) – for near guesses  
  - Way Way Off (⊙) – may be placed in center or given to a player  
- Only one question at a time.  
- Mayor must answer every question; may not speak or gesture.  
- Players may discuss freely among themselves.  
- No external help allowed.  

**End Conditions for Day Phase**:  
- Time runs out (app alerts)  
- Last Yes/No token is used → Mayor taps **No More Yes/No Tokens** in app  

**Guessing the Word**:  
- A player may guess the full Magic Word directly:  
  - ✅ "Is the word 'apple'?" → valid  
  - ❌ "Is it a kind of fruit?" → invalid (even if 'apple' is implied)  
- If guess is correct:  
  - Mayor taps **Correct** in app.  
  - Gives **Correct** token to guessing player.  
  - Werewolf reveals role.  
  - 15-second round: Werewolf guesses who the Seer is by pointing.  
    - If correct → Werewolf team wins  
    - If incorrect → Village team wins  
- If guess is incorrect: game continues.

**If Word Is Not Guessed**:  
- 1-minute discussion (Mayor may now speak).  
- Players may claim any role (truthfully or not), but may not reveal cards.  
- After 1 minute, all players point at suspected Werewolf (cannot point at self).  
- Player with most votes reveals card:  
  - If Werewolf → Village wins  
  - If not → Werewolf team wins  
- **Tie for most votes**: All tied players reveal cards.  
  - If **any** is a Werewolf → Village wins  
  - If **no** Werewolf revealed → Werewolf team wins  
- **All players receive one vote** → Werewolf team wins automatically.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Mayor’s Role**:  
  - If Mayor is **Villager or Seer**: Wants word guessed. Should give truthful token answers.  
  - If Mayor is **Werewolf**: Wants to prevent guess. May lie with tokens and choose harder words.  

- **Token Use**:  
  - Limited supply of Yes/No tokens. Once gone, Day Phase ends.  
  - So Close: Use when a guess is very close (e.g., "Is it 'banana'?" when word is 'bandana').  
  - Way Way Off: Use when group is completely off track. Does not replace regular token.  

- **Seer’s Role**:  
  - Knows the word but must avoid revealing identity.  
  - Can subtly guide discussion, but over-participation risks exposure.  

- **Werewolf’s Role**:  
  - Knows the word.  
  - Should slow progress, waste tokens with unhelpful questions, and identify the Seer.  
  - If word is guessed, must identify Seer in 15 seconds to win.  

- **Multiple Werewolves**:  
  - 7–11 players: 2 Werewolves  
  - 12+ players: 3 Werewolves  
  - Werewolves see each other during Night Phase.  
  - If word is guessed: **Each Werewolf may point to a different player**. If **either** is the Seer → Werewolves win.  
  - If word is not guessed: Only **one** Werewolf needs to be correctly voted out for Village to win.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Village Team Wins If**:  
- Players guess the Magic Word AND the Werewolf(s) fail to identify the Seer.  
- OR, word is not guessed, but majority vote identifies at least one Werewolf (including in a tie).  

**Werewolf Team Wins If**:  
- Players fail to guess the word AND the vote does not identify a Werewolf (including all ties where no Werewolf is found, or all have one vote).  
- OR, word is guessed but the Werewolf(s) correctly identify the Seer.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Accidental Correct Button Press?** Tap **Whoops** in app to reverse endgame state.  
- **Guess at the Last Second?** If word is guessed as timer ends, Mayor should tap Correct. If app ends first, treat as failure to guess. Use **Whoops** to correct.  
- **Can the Mayor Ignore a Question?** No. Must respond to every question with a token.  
- **Can Players Ask Each Other Questions?** Yes, but only one question may be posed to the Mayor at a time.  
- **Can You Reveal Your Role Before Voting?** No. Cards remain hidden until final vote.  
- **What If the Mayor Is the Seer?**  
  - Mayor knows word from start (no need for Seer to wake up).  
  - Should choose easier words but avoid being too obvious.  
- **What If the Mayor Is a Werewolf?**  
  - Chooses harder word.  
  - May lie with tokens to mislead.  
  - Goal is same as other Werewolves.
