# Gentes — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

16. **Population Meeples**: Each player receives one of each type (6 total), placed on '0' spaces of Population Chart (3 left, 3 right).
17. **Starting Population**: Each player spends 4 Population Training Points to advance any 4 meeples (left or right) on their chart.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Game lasts 6 Rounds, grouped into 3 Eras:
- Era I: Rounds 1–2
- Era II: Rounds 3–4
- Era III: Rounds 5–6

Each Round has two phases:

#### Phase 1: Heyday Phase
- Players take turns clockwise, starting with Start Player.
- On turn, if player has empty Time Track space, they **must** perform an action.
- Player cannot voluntarily pass unless Time Track is full.
- Actions include:
  - Taking Action Tiles
  - Using Indicator Cube actions (via Civilization Cards or Hometowns)
  - Performing infinite actions (e.g., Tax Collector)
- Turn order continues until all players pass (Time Tracks full).

#### Phase 2: Decline Phase
Simultaneous steps:
1. Return Action Tiles to board.
2. Remove one Hourglass Token per Time Track space; slide remaining to left.
3. Return Indicator Cubes from Civilization Cards and Hometowns to supply.
4. Determine new Start Player (if Leader tile was taken).
5. Advance Round Marker; check for Era change.
6. Activate one City per region (red, yellow, green).
7. Activate Civilization Cards with Decline Phase effects.
8. Check hand limit: for each card beyond 3, place 1 Hourglass Token on Time Track (can double up).
9. If Round 6 completed → Final Scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Actions
Players perform actions by:
- Taking Action Tiles (most actions)
- Placing Indicator Cubes (on cards or Hometowns)
- Using infinite actions (no tile/cube needed)

Each action requires:
- Payment in coins
- Space on Time Track for Action Tile and Hourglass Tokens
- Meeting any prerequisites

##### Action Details:

**Tax Collector (Infinite Action)**
- No Action Tile needed.
- Option 1: Place 1 Hourglass → Gain 4 coins.

**Philosopher (Train Population)**

    - 2 People: Use bottom row (2-population costs); choose two careers ≤ paid cost
- Advance Population Meeples accordingly:
  - Right: Noble, Soldier, Priest
  - Left: Artisan, Merchant, Scholar
- **Population Rules**:
  - No meeple can go below 0.
  - Meeples in same row block each other:
    - Priest ↔ Scholar
    - Soldier ↔ Merchant
    - Noble ↔ Artisan
  - If movement would pass or land on blocked space, push opponent meeple back instead.
- **Training Track Update**:
  1. Remove used Training Cost Meeples.
  2. Slide remaining left to fill gaps.
