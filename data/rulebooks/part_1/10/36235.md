## The Duke — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the lawless outlying duchies, rival dukes battle for unclaimed lands where the king’s rule does not reach. Might makes right, and possession is power. Players command a small but versatile army of troops represented by dual-sided tiles, each side showing a different movement pattern. The goal is to outmaneuver your opponent and **capture their Duke** to win the game.

### 2. Components  
- **Game board**: 6×6 grid  
- **Player tiles (per player)**:  
  - Duke (2-sided)  
  - Footman (2-sided)  
  - Pikeman (2-sided)  
  - Ranger (2-sided)  
  - Champion (2-sided)  
  - Duchess (2-sided)  
  - Assassin (2-sided)  
  - Wizard (2-sided)  
- Additional alternate unit tiles (e.g., Robin Hood, Richelieu, Arthur, Morgana, siege weapons, etc.)  
- **Random draw bag or container** for tiles not yet deployed  

*Note: This is a print-and-play version; players must cut out and assemble tiles by matching front and back sides.*

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player places their **Duke** on their starting square (opposite corners of the board).  
2. All other unit tiles are placed face-down into a draw bag.  
3. Players alternate turns, with **White moving first**.  

*Optional Variants:*  
- **Musketeers, Light Side**: Remove Duke, Duchess, Assassin, Wizard. Choose 3 characters to begin; new tiles deploy to Duke’s starting square. Win by capturing Richelieu.  
- **Musketeers, Dark Side**: Remove Duke, Duchess, Wizard. Richelieu acts as Duke. Win when no enemy characters remain.  
- **Robin Hood, Light Side**: Remove Ranger, one Footman, one Pikeman, Assassin, and Duke. Robin Hood is Duke. Win when no enemy characters remain.  
- **Robin Hood, Dark Side**: Remove Duke, Champion, Duchess. Start with Sir Guy and 2 Footmen. New units deploy next to highest-ranking character (Prince John > Sheriff > Sir Guy). Win by capturing Robin Hood.  
- **King Arthur, Light Side**: Remove Duke, Duchess, Wizard, Champion, Assassin. Arthur is Duke. Character in Camelot gains command over adjacent 8 tiles. Flip Camelot when using ability.  
- **King Arthur, Dark Side**: Remove Duke, Duchess. Start with Morgana and 2 Footmen. Both Morgana and Mordred act as Duke. Win by capturing Arthur. Enemy non-character tiles in Camelot can be turned (rotated 180° and Camelot flipped).  
- **Siege Weapons / Robert E Howard / Reinforcements**: Optional alternate units that may be deployed instead of base units when drawn. Engineer is linked to all siege weapons.  
- **Reinforcements – City Troops**: Exchange none or all of each reinforcement tile for corresponding base tile(s).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, you **must** take **one** of the following actions:  

#### A. **Move a Tile**  
- Select one of your tiles on the board.  
- Move it according to the movement pattern shown on its **up-facing side**.  
- After completing the move:  
  - **Flip the tile** to its reverse side.  
  - If the destination square contains an **opponent’s tile**, **capture it** (remove from the board and place in opponent’s reserve/bag).  
  - Movement cannot jump over pieces unless the pattern allows it.  
  - You may not move into a square occupied by your own tile.  

#### B. **Deploy a New Tile**  
- Draw one tile at random from your bag.  
- Place it on an **empty starting square** (your Duke’s original position), **unless a variant rule changes deployment location** (e.g., Musketeers deploy to Duke start; Robin Hood dark side deploys next to highest-ranking unit).  
- Deployed tile starts on its **starting side** (indicated by symbol or context).  
- If the square is occupied, **capture the enemy unit** there.  

*Exception: Some abilities allow special deployment (e.g., Summon, Divination).*

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Tile Flipping  
- Every time a tile is moved, it **must be flipped** to its other side.  
- Each side has a unique movement pattern.  
- Movement patterns are not repeated; flipping creates evolving tactical options.  

#### Capturing  
- Occurs when a moving tile ends its path on a square occupied by an **enemy tile**.  
- The captured tile is removed and returned to the opponent’s bag/reserve.  
- Capturing is **not optional** if movement ends on an enemy tile.  

#### Enhanced Abilities  
Some tiles or game states grant special abilities:  

- **Summon (1)**: Place this tile on an empty square **orthogonally adjacent to your Duke**. Flip the **Duke**, but **not this tile**.  
- **Divination (11)**: Can only be used if tile is on **non-starting side**. Flip the tile, then **draw 3 random tiles** from your bag. Deploy **1** of them; return others to bag or **destroy** (remove from game) as desired.  
- **Escape (111)**: Sacrifice a friendly unit adjacent to this tile **or** return a captured **ransom** tile to opponent’s bag. Then move this tile to **either Duke starting square**, capturing any enemy there. Can unblock by sacrificing if both are blocked by friendly units.  
- **Ransom (IV)**: Return a captured enemy **ransom** tile to opponent’s bag; redeploy a captured **friendly escape** unit.  
- **Redeploy (V)**: Draw and deploy a new tile; return the **redeploy** tile to the bag. **Redeploy tiles cannot be commanded** (cannot be moved voluntarily).  
- **Link (VI)**:  
  - **Starting side**: Flip linker, then flip and optionally activate linked tile.  
  - **Non-starting side**: Flip linker, then **deploy first matching linked tile** drawn from bag (e.g., Engineer links to siege weapons). Units drawn during this process are counted and returned to bag if not used.  

#### Character Roles in Variants  
- In many variants, a **character tile (e.g., Arthur, Richelieu, Robin Hood)** replaces the Duke as the key unit.  
- Some variants change **win condition** (e.g., eliminate all enemy characters instead of capturing Duke).  
- Deployment rules may change (e.g., deploy next to highest-ranking unit).  

#### Camelot (King Arthur variants)  
- A special square or mechanic where:  
  - **Light Side**: Character in Camelot controls all 8 adjacent tiles. Use ability by **flipping Camelot**, not the character.  
  - **Dark Side**: Can **turn** any enemy non-character tile (rotate 180°) by flipping Camelot.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Standard Win Condition**: **Capture your opponent’s Duke**.  
- **Variant Win Conditions**:  
  - Musketeers (Dark), Robin Hood (Light), King Arthur (Light): Win when **no enemy characters remain** on the board.  
  - Musketeers (Light), Robin Hood (Dark), King Arthur (Dark): Win by **capturing a specific character** (Richelieu, Robin Hood, Arthur).  
- Game ends immediately when win condition is met.  
- There is **no scoring system**—the game is won by achieving the victory condition.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I pass my turn?**  
  A: No. You must either move a tile or deploy a new one.  

- **Q: Can I move a tile that has no legal moves?**  
  A: If no legal move exists for any of your tiles, you **must deploy** a new tile if possible. If your bag is empty and no moves are possible, you lose (though this is rare).  

- **Q: What happens when a tile is flipped and the new side has no moves?**  
  A: It remains on the board and may still be moved on a future turn if a path opens up.  

- **Q: Can I capture my own piece?**  
  A: No. You cannot move into a square occupied by your own tile.  

- **Q: Can I use Summon if the Duke is captured?**  
  A: No. Summon requires your Duke to be on the board.  

- **Q: What is a “ransom” or “escape” tile?**  
  A: These are special unit types designated in variants. Only specific tiles have these tags.  

- **Q: Can I deploy a tile if my starting square is blocked?**  
  A: Yes, if deploying to the starting square and it’s occupied by an enemy, you **capture** them. If occupied by your own unit, you cannot deploy there unless a variant allows alternate deployment (e.g., next to a leader).
