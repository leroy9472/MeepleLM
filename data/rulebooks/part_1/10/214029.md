## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
SpaceCorp is a strategic space exploration and development game spanning three eras: Mariners, Planeteers, and Starfarers. Players take on the role of corporations expanding humanity’s reach through research, discovery, production, and colonization. The ultimate goal is to earn the most profit (F) by the end of the Starfarers era through fulfilling contracts, establishing colonies, and leveraging technological advancements.

Victory is determined at the end of the Starfarers era:
- Most profit wins.
- Tiebreaker: highest total colony value → most Adaptation/Breakthrough cards → shared victory.

### 3. Setup  
**General Setup (All Eras):**
1. Place current era board; set Business Display beside it.
2. Place 7 orange Contract Fulfilled markers on their starting positions.
3. Prepare Discovery tile stacks:
   - **Mariners/Planeteers**: Shuffle e1 (6/6), e2 (3/14), e3 (0/8) tiles into face-down stacks.
   - **Starfarers**: Shuffle 16 Primary → 2×8 stacks, 12 Secondary → 2×6 stacks, 5 Alien tokens as separate stack.
4. Place 1st and 2nd Beyond markers on designated sites:
   - **Mariners/Planeteers**: Asteroid Belt
   - **Planeteers**: 1st → Ceres (free explore), 2nd → Vesta (unexplored)
   - **Starfarers**: 1st → Alpha Centauri, 2nd → Luhman 16
5. Each player takes:
   - HQ matching the era
   - Profit marker placed at 0 (3rd player starts at 1 in 3p; 4th at 1 in 4p)
   - 9 base markers (3 of each type), 2 teams (3 in Starfarers)
   - 1 tan Genetics cube and 1 black Revelation cube on Progress Wheel start
6. Deck preparation:
   - Set aside 12 “Start” cards.
   - Add 0 (2p), 2 (3p), or 4 (4p) Time cards to the era deck; shuffle.
   - Shuffle remaining Start cards and place on top of deck.
7. Starting hands:
   - **Mariners**: 1 Time card + 1 Chemical Drive (Start card)
   - **Planeteers/Starfarers**: 1 Time card + 2 random Start cards
8. First player:
   - **Mariners**: Last gazed at night sky
   - **Planeteers/Starfarers**: Previous 1st Beyond holder → least profit → random
9. Reveal 4 cards from deck into offer boxes.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows this sequence:

1. **Conduct an Action**  
   Choose one of: Research, Move, Explore, Build, Produce, Genetics, Upgrade, Special, Revelation (Planeteers+), Colonize (Starfarers only).

   Action value is calculated using:
   - Matching Infra from any one HQ (yours or opponent’s)
   - Playing one or more matching cards from hand
   - Base abilities
   - Progress card bonuses (Planeteers+)
   - Spending up to 3F to cover shortfall (Planeteers+)

   *Exception*: Upgrade and Special require playing a single card.

2. **Claim Contract(s)**  
   If prerequisites are met and contract unfulfilled, claim it. Gain listed F, slide orange marker to current era column. Multiple contracts may be claimed per turn.

3. **Opponents Claim Rewards**  
   For each use of opponent’s Infra or base, they draw 1 card (in turn order).

4. **Perform Free Team Transport**  
   Move one team that did **not** act this turn:
   - Must start and end at your base
   - At least one base must be a Spaceport
   - Any distance allowed

5. **Discard & Replenish**  
   - Discard all played non-Upgraded cards
   - Replenish empty offer boxes from draw deck (if available)

6. **Draw Phase**  
   If 4 or fewer cards in hand, draw 1 from deck.

*Edge cards* may be played during any player’s turn when conditions are met.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions  
**Research**  
- Only if ≤7 cards in hand
- Draw cards equal to Research value from deck or offers (one at a time)

**Move**  
- Must start or end at your base (cannot use opponent base after endgame triggered)
- Distance = 1 (lift-off) + region border costs + 1 (landing) + gravity penalties
- Gravity penalty applies if move starts or ends on high-gravity site (e.g., Earth +2)
- Mars North/South direct move costs 3 (no gravity penalty)
- Transit additions apply when departing certain outer planets
- First to Asteroid Belt/Oort Cloud takes 1st Beyond; second takes 2nd
- Teams in Beyond zones cannot act

**Explore**  
- Requires team at site with unexplored box and e# cost ≤ Explore value
- Draw tile from stack matching e#; place in exploration box
- Immediate rewards: F, Gen#, Rev#, P#, Base#, Col#
- Claim site by placing team on tile
- **Alien tiles**:
  - *Phobes*: Move one team to Sol unless you have Energy Fields; no benefits until Secure base built
  - *Introvs*: Cannot build bases unless you have Cooperative Empathy or Sensory Focus

**Build**  
- Requires team at site, no existing base, all exploration boxes filled
- Build value ≥ site’s b# (after modifiers)
- If opponent claimed site, they gain 2F
- **Starfarers**: One action builds bases on **all** Discovery tiles in system
- Base modifiers adjust cost (cannot go below 0)

**Produce**  
- Collect F from eligible tiles (have P# and your base)
- Produce value ≥ number of tiles collected from
- Gain total P# in F

**Genetics**  
- Move tan Genetics marker clockwise = action value
- Full orbit → gain 1 Adaptation card (choose from available; immediate F bonus)

**Revelation** (Planeteers+)  
- Move black Revelation marker clockwise = action value
- Full orbit → gain 1 Breakthrough card (choose from available; immediate F bonus)

**Upgrade**  
- Play one "May Upgrade as Infra" card to Infra slot (1–3)
- Cannot go in Research slot
- Same era: return old card to hand; previous era: remove from play
- New Infra available immediately

**Special**  
- Play one Special card (even if multiple held)
- Follow effect in grey box

**Colonize** (Starfarers only)  
- In region with:
  - All exploration boxes occupied by **your** bases
  - No existing colony
- Team presence not required
- Must accumulate CP ≥ colony tile value
- CP sources:
  - Sum of Discovery tile values in region
  - +1 CP if you have a nearby colony (≤20 distance)
  - +1 CP if Industrial base in region
  - +1 CP if 2+ bases in region
  - −1 CP if remove one of your teams from region
  - +1 CP if used Build value ≥8 (≥12 in multi-star system)
  - +1 CP if spend 5F
  - +1 CP if own Enviro Tolerance Adaptation

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End of Era Triggers  
An era ends when:
- 6 of 7 contracts are fulfilled → all other players get 1 more turn
- OR draw deck is exhausted → players may pass instead of acting:
  - 2p: after one pass, remaining player gets one turn
  - 3–4p: after two passes, remaining players each get one turn
- Edge exception: Intercept grants extra turn regardless

After endgame triggered, **cannot use opponent’s Infra or bases**

#### Era Transition  
**Mariners → Planeteers / Planeteers → Starfarers:**
1. **Legacy Production**: Choose one Discovery tile with P# and your base; move both to LP slot on HQ. Discard old LP tile.
2. **Cards**:
   - Keep Time cards and Infra cards on HQ
   - Remove all other era-specific cards
   - Progress cards remain
3. **Pieces**: Remove all teams/bases from board; return to HQ
4. **Discovery tiles**: Return to box
5. **Business Display**: Keep as-is
6. **Board**: Replace with next era
7. **Sideboard**: Flip Mariners board to Sideboard side (Mariners→Planeteers); keep in place (Planeteers→Starfarers)

#### Increased Contract Rewards  
- Unfulfilled Mariners contract → reward in Planeteers = sum of Mariners + Planeteers values
- Unfulfilled Planeteers contract → reward in Starfarers = sum of Planeteers + Starfarers values
- Unfulfilled Mariners contract → reward in Starfarers = sum of all three eras

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I use opponent’s base after end of era is triggered?**  
A: No. Base/Infra use restricted to own only once endgame triggered.

**Q: Can I claim multiple contracts in one turn?**  
A: Yes, if all prerequisites are met.

**Q: Do I need a team to Colonize?**  
A: No. Colonize only requires bases and no existing colony.

**Q: Can I build in a system with Phobes tile?**  
A: Yes, but no benefits until Secure base built (unless you have Energy Fields).

**Q: Can I use multipliers without additive cards?**  
A: Yes. Use one card as base value (e.g., x3, x3, x5 → treat as 3, x3, x5).

**Q: What happens if I can’t pay radiation penalty?**  
A: You cannot take the unshielded action.

**Q: Can I transport a team that explored but didn’t "perform an action"?**  
A: No. Explore is an action; team cannot be transported.

**Q: Can I use a base ability from a different region?**  
A: No. Base abilities only apply at their site or region.
