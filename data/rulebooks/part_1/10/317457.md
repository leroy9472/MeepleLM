### 1. Lore & Objective
In Dinosaur World, players build and manage their own dinosaur parks, aiming to create the most exciting, innovative, and lucrative attraction. The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VP) by constructing attractions, cloning dinosaurs, completing objectives, and managing park safety. While visitor deaths may occur, maintaining a safer park relative to opponents minimizes penalties.

- Second round: Draft in reverse order (1 tile of opposite type).
- Place tiles adjacent to Welcome Center. Score immediate VP if indicated.
- Leftover tiles go to discard piles.

*(Beginner variant: Use fixed tile pairs instead of random draft.)*

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round has 5 phases. All players must complete one phase before moving to the next.

1. **Hire Workers (Turn Order)**
   - Reveal (players + 1) Worker Database cards.
   - Players draft one card each in turn order, taking displayed Workers.
   - Discard used cards. Shuffle if deck is empty.

2. **Public Actions (Turn Order)**
   - Draw and roll (players + 2) DNA dice; place on Central Islands.
   - Players take turns performing one public action or passing.
   - Actions:
     - **Gather DNA:** Choose one die. Spend 1–3 Workers to gain its DNA × number of Workers. Return die to bag.
     - **Build a Dino Paddock:** Pay 2 Workers (or 1 Administrator) + Coin cost. Place tile adjacent to existing park tile. Cannot be adjacent to another Paddock.
     - **Build an Attraction:** Pay Coin cost. No Worker cost. Place adjacent to existing tile.
     - **Build a Special Building:** Pay 1 Worker + Coin cost. Place adjacent. Score immediate VP if shown.
   - After all pass, return DNA dice to bag.

3. **Private Actions (Simultaneous)**
   - All players place Workers on their Park board action spaces.
   - Each action space has 3 slots (max 3 uses per round).
   - Actions:
     - **DNA Refinement:** Combine 2 basic DNA → 1 advanced, or split 1 advanced → 2 basic. One transaction per Worker.
     - **VC Funding:** Gain Coins (amount depends on slot used; decreases by 1 per slot).
     - **Security:** Pay Coins to increase Security track. Cost depends on zone entered.
     - **Jeeple Garage:** Pay Coins to advance Jeeple Upgrade track. Reaching a new zone grants a Route token and Jeeple Bonus.
     - **Make Dinosaurs:** Spend DNA to place one Dino per Worker in a Paddock with empty slot. Pay base + slot DNA cost. Gain Threat and VP from slot.
   - Workers can be any color; colored Workers grant bonuses (e.g., Scientist gives +1 DNA when refining).

4. **Jeeple Tour (Simultaneous)**
   - Move Jeeple from Welcome Center/Park Entrance using Route tokens (1 per tile).
   - May visit each tile once per round.
   - When visiting a tile:
     - **Special Buildings/Attractions:** Place required Worker(s) to activate. Pay Excitement if required. Gain Excitement (printed value minus Boredom). Increase Boredom by 1 (max 5). Take tile action.
     - **Dino Paddocks:** Must have at least one Dino. Gain Excitement (sum of filled slot values minus Boredom). Increase Boredom by 1. Make one Danger roll (based on Dino type); gain 1 Death per icon rolled.
     - **No activation:** Still costs movement (Route token), but no effects.
   - Cannot revisit Welcome Center/Park Entrance.

5. **Income & Cleanup**
   - **Return Jeeple & Route Tokens:** Move Jeeple back; return tokens.
   - **Jeeple Bonus:** Gain all bonuses from slotted Jeeple Bonus tokens.
   - **Coin Income:** Gain Coins equal to current Excitement level.
   - **Reset Excitement:** Set to 0.
   - **Return Workers:** Return all placed Workers to supply.
   - **Evaluate Threat:** If Threat > Security, gain Death tokens equal to the difference.
   - **Cleanup Central Islands:**
     - Return DNA dice to bag.
     - Discard 2 Dino Paddock tiles (3 in 2-player); refill from stack.
     - Discard 2 Special Building tiles (3 in 2-player); refill.
     - *(If Paddock stack empty, shuffle discards. If Special Building stack empty, no more are drawn.)*
   - **Cleanup Public Notice Board:**
     - Set turn order: lowest VP first, highest last. Tiebreaker: previously later player moves ahead.
     - Advance Round Marker.
     - **Round 3 only:** Flip Welcome Center to Park Entrance side and move at least 3 spaces away.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **DNA Management:** Gather via dice, refine (combine/split), spend to make Dinosaurs.
- **Tile Placement:** All new tiles must be adjacent to existing park tiles. Dino Paddocks cannot be adjacent. No duplicate tile names.
- **Jeeple Movement:** Use Route tokens to move. Max one visit per tile per round.
- **Boredom:** Increases by 1 each time a tile is activated (max 5). Reduces Excitement gained.
- **Threat & Security:** Threat increases when making Dinosaurs. If Threat > Security at cleanup, gain Death tokens.
- **Danger Rolls:** Made when activating Dino Paddocks. Based on Dino type (Herbivore, Small Carnivore, Large Carnivore). Each icon rolled = 1 Death.
- **Objectives:** Score anytime during a round by placing Objective marker. If multiple players score same objective in same phase, turn order breaks tie.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after Round 5 (or 6 if Long Game variant).

**Final Scoring:**
- **VP from Coins:** 1 VP per $5.
- **VP from Objectives:** Scored during game.
- **VP from Attractions/Special Buildings:** Some have end-game scoring.
- **Death Penalty:**
   - Player with fewest Death tokens discards all.
   - All others discard same number.
   - Remaining Deaths are penalized:
     | Deaths | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10+ |
     |--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|
     | VP Lost | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 13 | 15 +1 per extra |
- **Total Score:** VP minus Death penalties.

**Tiebreakers:**
1. Most leftover DNA.
2. Last in turn order.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I gather DNA from a die I don’t fully use?** Yes. Choose any die, multiply DNA by Workers spent.
- **Can I build a tile not adjacent to any tile?** No. Must be adjacent.

- **Can I spend Excitement to activate a tile?** Yes, if (printed Excitement – Boredom) is negative.

- **What happens if I can’t place a Paddock?** You cannot purchase it.
- **Can I score an Objective during Cleanup?** Yes, at any time during a round.
- **Can I have more than one of the same Dinosaur type?** Yes. Only tile names are restricted.
- **What if I run out of DNA markers?** Use substitutes; supply is unlimited.
- **Can I save unused Workers?** Yes. Unplaced Workers are kept for next round.
