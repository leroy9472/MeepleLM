# SANTIAGO — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players are landowners on the Cape Verde Island of Santiago, where water is scarce. They compete to grow crops (bananas, coconuts, watermelons, grapes, peppers) by acquiring plantations, irrigating them with canals, and connecting same-type plantations into larger groups. The goal is to earn the most points (in escudos) by the end of the game through plantation income and remaining money. The player with the highest total score wins.

2. Components  
- Game board with thick and thin lines forming a grid  
- 1 spring pawn  
- 3 palm trees (used in variant)  
- 45 plantation tiles:  
  - 9 each of: bananas, coconuts, watermelons, grapes, peppers  
  - Each tile has 1 or 2 farmer icons (indicating number of farmers to place)  
- 110 farmers (22 in each of 5 player colors)  
- 15 blue canals (used to build irrigation network)  
- 5 proposed canals (1 in each player color)  
- 1 canal overseer token  
- 150 banknotes: denominations of 1, 2, 5, 20, and 50 escudos  
- Score track on board (for tracking points)

3. Setup  
A. Place the board in the center.  
B. Place the spring pawn on any intersection of thick lines. For first games, place it in the center (not on edge or corner).  
C. Place 3 palm trees on non-adjacent squares (not touching each other or the spring, even diagonally).  
D. Shuffle plantation tiles face-down and form stacks:  
- 3 or 4 players: 4 stacks of 11 tiles each (1 tile revealed and removed)  
- 5 players: 5 stacks of 9 tiles each  
E. Give each player:  
- 22 farmers in their color  
- 1 proposed canal in their color  
- 1 blue canal (personal additional canal)  
- 10 escudos (any combination)  
F. Place remaining blue canals near board:  
- 3 or 4 players: 11 canals  
- 5 players: 9 canals  
G. Form bank: remaining money sorted by denomination.  
H. First canal overseer: player who most recently worked on a farm or is oldest.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts:  
- 11 rounds for 3 or 4 players  
- 9 rounds for 5 players  
Each round consists of 7 phases:

Phase 1: Auction  
- Reveal top tile from each plantation stack.  
- Starting with player to the left of canal overseer, each player either:  
  - Bids a unique amount (not equal to any prior bid)  
  - Passes (bids nothing)  
- Bidding proceeds clockwise. Each player bids once. Auction ends after overseer’s bid.

Phase 2: New Canal Overseer  
- The player who passed first becomes the new canal overseer.  
- If no one passed, the lowest bidder becomes the new overseer.  
- That player takes the canal overseer token.

Phase 3: Place Plantations  
- Players place tiles in order from highest to lowest bid.  
- For each player:  
  - Pay bid to the bank  
  - Choose one revealed plantation tile  
  - Place it on any empty square (if square has palm tree, place palm tree on tile)  
  - Place farmers: one per farmer icon on tile  
- Players who passed:  
  - Act after all bidders  
  - If multiple passed, order is reverse of passing (last to pass goes first)  
  - Place one fewer farmer than shown (0 farmers if tile has 1 icon)  
- In 3-player games: one tile remains. Highest bidder places it adjacent to any non-desert tile (no farmers; neutral).

Phase 4: Build a Canal  
- Starting with player to the left of canal overseer, each player may:  
  - Propose a canal location by placing their colored proposed canal on a valid spot (must connect to network, on thick lines between intersections)  
  - Offer a bribe (≥1 escudo) to encourage overseer  
  - Support another’s proposal by adding a bribe (≥1 escudo) to it  
  - Pass (no action)  
- Multiple players may propose same location; bribes combine.  
- Canal overseer chooses:  
  - Accept one proposal: take all bribes for that location, place blue canal there  
  - Reject all: place canal anywhere valid, pay to bank 1 more than highest total bribe  
- Special: If all pass, overseer may build canal by paying 1 escudo; if unable/unwilling, no canal is built.  
- Return all proposed canals to owners; unsuccessful bribes returned.

Phase 5: Build an Additional Canal  
- Starting with player to the left of overseer, each player may:  
  - Place their personal blue canal on a valid spot (must connect to network, on thick lines)  
- Only one additional canal per round.  
- Once placed, phase ends.  
- Each player can do this only once in the game.

Phase 6: Drying  
- For each plantation tile not adjacent to any canal:  
  - Remove 1 farmer (return to box)  
  - If tile had only 1 farmer, it becomes neutral (no owner)  
  - If tile is neutral and non-irrigated, flip to desert side (permanent)  
- In last round: all non-irrigated tiles (even with farmers) become desert; remove farmers.

Phase 7: Income  
- Each player receives 3 escudos from the bank.  
- In last round: skip this phase.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Canal Network:  
  - Must start at spring  
  - Built on thick lines between intersections  
  - Must connect to existing network  
  - Can branch freely  
- Plantation Placement:  
  - Must be on empty square  
  - Can be adjacent to other tiles or not  
  - Can be placed on palm tree square (palm tree moves to tile)  
- Plantation Expansion:  
  - Orthogonally adjacent same-type tiles form one large plantation  
  - Canals or palm trees within do not break continuity  
  - Desert tiles break continuity  
- Drying:  
  - Unirrigated tiles lose 1 farmer per round  
  - Neutral unirrigated tiles become desert  
  - Desert cannot be restored  
- Palm Tree Scoring (variant):  
  - If a player has a farmer on a tile with a palm tree, palm tree counts as +1 farmer during scoring  
  - Does not prevent drying

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after:  
- 11 rounds (3 or 4 players)  
- 9 rounds (5 players)  
End game procedure:  
1. Final Drying:  
   - All non-irrigated plantation tiles become desert (flip over), even if they have farmers  
   - Remove all farmers from such tiles  
2. Scoring:  
   - Players keep all remaining escudos (1 point per escudo)  
   - For each plantation (connected group of same crop):  
     - Player scores: (number of tiles in plantation) × (number of their farmers in it)  
     - If player has farmer on tile with palm tree, add +1 to their farmer count for that tile  
   - Score each plantation separately per player  
   - Mark points on score track  
- Winner: player with highest total points  
- Tie: shared victory

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can a canal be placed diagonally? No. Canals must be on thick lines, which are orthogonal only.  
- Can a plantation tile be placed on a desert? Yes, if no other space is available (in 3-player game during Phase 3).  
- What if two players tie in bid? Bids must be unique; ties not allowed.  
- Can a player place a canal that doesn’t connect? No. All canals (Phases 4 and 5) must connect to existing network.  
- Can palm trees be on desert? No. If plantation with palm tree becomes desert, palm tree is returned to box.  
- Can a player with no money bid 0? Yes, by passing.  
- What if canal overseer cannot pay to reject all proposals? Then they must accept one proposal.  
- Can a player support their own proposal? Rules do not specify, but inferred as allowed (as “support a suggestion” is general).  
- Can a neutral plantation become owned again? No. Once neutral or desert, it remains so unless a farmer is placed via placement (but only during Phase 3, and only if tile is not desert).
