3. Place Reals from bank on the two Character Area money spaces as shown on left VdG Tile.
4. Players take turns clockwise placing one Action Disc or Additional Action Disc:

### 5. Core Mechanics

- **Action Selection**: Players place discs with sequence numbers; actions resolve in numerical order.
- **Free of Charge Action Marker (FFoCAM)**: Determines cost of actions. If your Sequence Number ≥ FFoCAM, action is free.
- **Character Control**: Hosting a character grants immediate power and ongoing end-of-round benefits.
- **Crew Requirements**: Launching ships requires crew of distinct colors.
- **Navigation**: Ships progress up the coast only if Landings are fully occupied.
- **Project Economy**: Players buy and launch ships to deploy in expeditions.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

**Q: Can I launch a ship during another player’s turn?**  
A: Yes. Launching can be done at any time, even during another player’s action.

**Q: Can I host a character I already control?**  
A: Yes. You may host a character you already have; you still use their power immediately.

**Q: What happens if I can’t pay the crew for a final launch?**  
A: You cannot launch. Only launched ships with captains score 3 VPs.

**Q: Can a ship move from Calicut to another Landing?**  
A: No. Calicut is the final Landing. Ships in complete Calicut are scored but discarded during navigation.

**Q: What if the Sailor bag is empty during refill?**  
A: Fill Recruiting Windows only with remaining Sailors. Do not refill beyond availability.

**Q: Can I take a bonus that is unavailable?**  
A: No. Bonuses are lost if not available, except money (which is unlimited).

**Q: Can I use Manuel I’s extra action in Phase 1 if I gain it during Phase 2?**  
A: No. The Additional Action Disc must be placed during Phase 1. If gained later (e.g., via hosting), it can only be used in future rounds.
