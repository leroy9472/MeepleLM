## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In Ex Libris, players are rival book collectors vying to become the Grand Librarian of a fantasy town. The Mayor will appoint the winner based on the quality and organization of their personal library. The goal is to impress the Official Inspector by building a bookshelf that excels in alphabetical order, shelf stability, prominent works, categorical variety, and alignment with a secret library focus—while minimizing banned books.

### 2. Components
- Town Board
- 18 Location Tiles (including Diviner’s Hut)
- 12 Library Tiles
- 12 Special Assistants (one per library)
- 8 Standard Assistants (2 per player in 2–4 player games)
- 152 Book Cards (each depicting multiple books across six categories)
- 6 Category Cards
- First Player Token
- Official Library Inspection Form (for scoring)
- Deck and discard pile areas

### 3. Setup
1. Place the **Town Board** in the center.
2. Place **Diviner’s Hut** face-up below the board. Shuffle the remaining 17 Location Tiles into a face-down stack.
3. Give the **First Player Token** to the player who most recently acquired a real book.
4. Shuffle the 12 **Library Tiles**, deal 2 to each player. In reverse player order, each player chooses one and discards the other.
5. Each player takes the matching **Special Assistant** and 2 **Standard Assistants** in their chosen color.
6. Shuffle the 6 **Category Cards**. Reveal one to the **Prominent Works** space and one to the **Banned Books** space.
7. Deal one remaining category card face-down to each player as their **Library Focus**. Return extras to the box.
8. Shuffle the 152 **Book Cards**, deal 6 to each player as a starting hand. Place the rest in two face-up stacks within reach.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of four phases:

#### I. Preparation Phase
- The first player reveals one Location Tile per player from the stack and places them face-up below the Town Board. (In Round 1, only N–1 tiles are revealed, as Diviner’s Hut is already present.)
- Follow any **preparation instructions** (e.g., deal cards to a tile’s card area). Splay cards so information is visible.

#### II. Placement Phase
- Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, players take turns placing one assistant (standard or special) on:
  - An unoccupied space on a Location Tile, or
  - One of the three home action spaces on their Library Tile.
- Players continue placing until all assistants are used.
- **Special Rules:**
  - If placing on a location with an **Instant Effect** (lightning bolt), resolve it immediately.
  - If placing on a location with a **Delayed Effect** (clock), it resolves later.
  - Placing your **Special Assistant** triggers its unique ability (see glossary).
  - Some locations have player-count restrictions (e.g., spaces numbered > player count are blocked).

#### III. Resolution Phase
- Resolve all Location Tiles in **numerical order** (starting with Diviner’s Hut):
  1. Resolve **Delayed Effects**.
  2. Discard any remaining cards on the tile.
  3. Return all assistants to their owners.
- Permanent Locations (on the board) are resolved **after** temporary ones.

#### IV. Cleanup Phase
- Move the **lowest-numbered** temporary Location Tile to the **Permanent Locations** section of the Town Board.
- Discard all other temporary tiles to a face-up discard pile. Shuffle if needed to refill the stack.
- Return assistants from home spaces.
- Check for **Final Round trigger**: a player has shelved 16 (2p), 14 (3p), or 12 (4p) books. If so, the next round is the final one.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Shelving Cards:**
  - First card can go anywhere.
  - Each subsequent card must be **orthogonally adjacent** to an existing one.
  - Bookshelf may not exceed **three rows** in height.
- **Home Actions (Library Tile):**
  - Placing an assistant on your Library Tile lets you:
    - **Draw 1 card**, or
    - **Shelve 1 card** from your hand.
- **Location Effects (Instant & Delayed):**
  - **Diviner’s Hut (1):** Draw 1 card per assistant placed. Take First Player token.
  - **Ye Olde Book Swap (2):** Trade 1 card from your hand with 1 from the tile. May shelve new card.
  - **Auction House (3):** When placing, choose a bid space (1–4). Outbid lower bids (return assistant). During resolution, discard cards equal to your bid to take all 3 auctioned cards.
  - **Donation Centre (4):** Discard 1+ cards (hand/library), then shelve up to 2 from hand.
  - **Community Centre (5):** Take 1 card from tile, then give 1 remaining card to any opponent. May shelve both.
  - **Wishing Well (6):** Discard X cards (hand only), draw X+1. May shelve 1.
  - **Gambling Den (7):** Each player with an assistant names a unique category. Reveal 4 cards. Player with most matching books in their named category wins all matching cards, may shelve 1 per assistant present.
  - **Librarians Lodge (8):** Perform once each, in any order:
    - A) Move a previously placed assistant from a location to a home space and take a home action.
    - B) Swap a shelved card with one in hand, another in shelf, or reposition within shelf.
  - **Book Collector (9):** Discard any number of cards. For every 2 category icons matching the tile’s card, draw 1 card (rounded down). May shelve up to 2 drawn.
  - **Book Seller (10):** Take 1 card from tile. May shelve it.
  - **Garbage Dump (11):** Name a category. Search discard pile, take 1 card with that category. May shelve it.
  - **Local Drafthouse (12):** Player on space 1 reveals 2 cards per assistant present. Players take 1 each in placement order. May shelve any taken.
  - **Mystery Shack (13):** Name a category. Look at all face-down cards, take any matching. Return others face-down. May shelve 1.
  - **Rummage Sale (14):** Take 1 card. Take 1 extra if another assistant is present (any player). May shelve all.
  - **Assistants Guild (15):** Move a previously placed assistant from your home space to a location occupied by an opponent. Return their assistant. If location has Instant Effect, activate it.
  - **Tax Collector (16):** Each opponent discards 1 card (hand/library) to tile. You may discard X cards to take X from tile. May shelve any taken.
  - **Yard Sale (17):** Reveal any number from hand. Opponents, in turn, may take/shelve 1 or pass. Repeat until done. For each taken/shelved, draw 2, then shelve 1 from hand.
  - **Shelfmasons Guild (18):** Shift any number of adjacent cards in one row, any direction. Shelf must remain connected.

- **Special Assistant Abilities:**
  - Abilities trigger when placed, before location effects.
  - **Timing Priority:** Location effects > previously placed special assistants (oldest first).
  - See full glossary in rulebook for details (e.g., Goblin Sneak pickpockets, Gelatinous Cube forces trade).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Final Round Trigger:** After Cleanup, if any player has met the book threshold (16/14/12), the next round is final.
- After the final Resolution Phase, proceed to scoring.

#### Final Scoring Steps:
1. **Voluntary Flipping:** Players may flip any book facedown before inspection.
2. **Alphabetical Order Check (A1):**
   - From left to right, top to bottom, flip any card not alphabetically/numerically after the prior card.
3. **Categorical Tally (A2):**
   - Count books (not cards) per category for each player.
4. **Shelf Stability Bonus (B1):**
   - Score 1 point per card in the largest rectangle that:
     - Is at least 2×2,
     - Includes the bottom row,
     - Is fully filled.
   - Facedown cards count.
5. **Prominent Works Awards (B2):**

3. Fewest banned books.
4. First to finish reading a book (humorous tiebreaker).
