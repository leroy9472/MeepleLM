## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The town of Scoville was founded in honor of Wilbur Scoville, creator of the Scoville Organoleptic Test for measuring pepper heat. Players are pepper breeders tasked with cross-breeding, planting, harvesting, and fulfilling orders to earn the most points. The goal is to generate the most heat—literally and competitively—by breeding the hottest peppers, fulfilling lucrative recipes and market orders, and managing resources wisely.

### 2. Components  
- Game board (assembled from four jigsaw-style segments)  
- Pepper cubes/tokens in 10 colors: Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Orange, Purple, Brown, White, Black, Phantom

G. Starting Plots:  
   - Each player takes Red, Yellow, Blue cubes.  
   - Randomly choose two to place on the two starting plots (adjacent to star). Return the third to supply.  
H. Turn Order:  
   - Randomly place player discs on Turn Order Track (1 to N, matching player count).  
I. Cross-Breeding Charts: Place within reach of all players.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of five phases:  
1. **Auction**  
2. **Planting**  
3. **Harvesting**  
4. **Fulfillment**  
5. **Time Check**

#### 1. Auction  
- **First Round Only**: No bidding. Use setup turn order.  
- **Subsequent Rounds**:  
  - Slide discs off track, preserving last round’s order.  
  - Players secretly bid any amount of coins (including $0).  
  - Reveal bids simultaneously.  
  - Highest bidder chooses turn order spot, then next highest, etc.  
    - Tie (bids > $0): Player earlier in previous turn order chooses first.  
    - $0 bidders: After higher bidders choose, $0 bidders fill remaining spots in previous turn order.  
  - Players pay bids to bank.  
  - In new turn order, each player selects one Auction card, takes shown peppers, discards card.  
  - Refill Auction House: Draw new cards from current stage deck (Morning or Afternoon).  
    - If deck runs out, shuffle discards to form new deck.

#### 2. Planting  
- In turn order, each player **must** plant one pepper from their supply.  
- Peppers must be placed orthogonally adjacent to an existing pepper (or starting plot).  
- Optional: Use **Plant One Extra Pepper** Bonus Action Tile to plant a second pepper (same rules).  
- **Award Plaques**:  
  - If a player plants a pepper color with remaining plaques, they take the top (highest-value) plaque.  
  - Only **one plaque per player per round**, even with two plantings.  
  - Player may skip first plaque to claim second (if eligible).

#### 3. Harvesting  
- In **reverse turn order**, each player moves their farmer up to 3 steps.  
- **First Round**: Place farmer on the central star (facing any direction). This is not a step.  
- **Subsequent Rounds**: Start from last round’s ending position.  
- **Movement Rules**:  
  - Move 1–3 steps along paths between plots.  
  - Cannot pass through or stop on another farmer.  
  - Cannot retrace path (no backtracking).  
  - May pivot at start of turn, but cannot reverse direction mid-move unless using **Double Back Once** tile.  
- **Harvesting Peppers**:  
  - After each step, if the farmer ends between two **planted** plots, crossbreed using the chart.  
  - Resulting pepper(s) go to player’s supply.  
  - Some combinations yield nothing (e.g., Brown + Orange).  
- **Bonus Actions**:  
  - **+1 Move**: Play to take a 4th step.  
  - **Double Back Once**: Play to reverse direction once during movement (allows retracing path).  

#### 4. Fulfillment  
In turn order, each player may do **all** of the following (in any order, each once max):  
- **Visit Farmers’ Market**:  
  - Choose one face-up Market card.  
  - Pay required peppers to supply.  
  - Take rewards (coins, peppers, points).  
  - Keep card behind screen (worth points at game end).  
- **Compete at Chili Cookoff**:  
  - Choose one face-up Recipe card.  
  - Pay required peppers to supply.  
  - Keep card behind screen (worth points at game end).  
- **Sell a Batch of Peppers**:  
  - Sell up to 5 of **one color** of peppers.  
  - Value per pepper = $1 for every **2 peppers of that color currently planted in the field**, rounded down.  
  - Example: 4 blue peppers planted → each sold blue earns $2.

#### 5. Time Check  
- **Morning Phase**:  
  - If **Recipe cards < players**: Skip to endgame (play one final round).  
  - Else if **Market cards < players**: Progress to Afternoon.  
    - Discard remaining Morning Market cards.  
    - Draw Afternoon Market cards (same number as initial).  
    - Replace Morning Auction deck with Afternoon deck (leave current auction cards).  
- **Afternoon Phase**:  
  - If **Market cards < players OR Recipe cards < players**: Play one final round.  
  - If **both < players**: Game ends immediately (no final round).

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Cross-Breeding Chart Rules  
Peppers are bred when a farmer moves between two planted peppers. Use the chart:  
- Find one pepper on left column, follow row to column of second pepper.  
- Result is at intersection.

**Breeding Rules Summary**:  
- **Primary (Red, Yellow, Blue)**:  
  - Primary × same = 2 of itself  
  - Primary × different Primary = Secondary (e.g., Red + Yellow = Orange)  
  - Primary × Secondary = Brown  
- **Secondary (Green, Orange, Purple)**:  
  - Secondary × same = Black  
  - Secondary × different Secondary = White  
- **Brown**:  
  - Brown × Brown = 2 Browns  
  - Brown × Black = Black  
  - Brown × White = White  
- **Black**:  
  - Black × Black = 2 Blacks  
- **White**:  
  - White × White = 2 Whites  
  - White × Black = Phantom  
- **Phantom**:  
  - Phantom × Primary = White  
  - Phantom × Secondary = Black  
  - Phantom × Brown = 2 Browns  
  - Phantom × Black = 2 Blacks  
  - Phantom × White = 2 Whites  
  - Phantom × Phantom = 2 Phantoms  
- **Any Primary or Secondary × Black or White** = 1 of itself  

#### Bonus Action Tiles  
- **Plant One Extra Pepper**: Use in Planting phase to plant second pepper.  
- **+1 Move**: Use in Harvesting to take a 4th step.  
- **Double Back Once**: Use in Harvesting to reverse direction once.  
- Any unused tile at game end = 4 points.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Endgame Triggers**:  
- Afternoon: Market cards < players → play one final round.  
- Afternoon: Recipe cards < players → play one final round.  
- Afternoon: **Both** < players → game ends immediately.  

**Final Scoring (points from)**:  
1. Market Cards (points shown)  
2. Recipe Cards (points shown)  
3. Award Plaques (points shown)  
4. Unused Bonus Action Tiles (4 points each)  
5. Coins: $3 = 1 point (round down)  

**Tiebreaker**: Most coins wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **No legal move in Harvest?** Skip turn.  
- **Run out of pepper cubes?** Use substitutes (coins, tokens).  
- **Can I use multiple Bonus Action Tiles per turn?** Yes, if available.  
- **Can I sell more than 5 peppers?** No. Max 5 of one color per round.  
- **Can I harvest between field edges?** Yes, outer paths count.  
- **Can I harvest between empty and planted plot?** No. Both must be planted.  
- **Can I plant on starting plots later?** Yes, if empty.  
- **Do Auction cards refresh before or after claiming?** After all players choose.
