## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   The parade has started in Wonderland—everyone is dressed up and excited. As a parade organizer, your goal is to keep people engaged, but participants quickly lose interest and leave when someone with a matching outfit or higher status joins.  
   **Objective**: Play all your cards while avoiding collecting cards from the parade. Collected cards contribute to your score negatively—**the lowest total score wins**.

2. **Components**  
   - 66 cards total: 6 suits (colours)  
   - Each suit contains cards valued 0 through 10 (11 cards per suit)  
   - No additional components required; game uses only the deck

3. **Setup**  
   - Shuffle the full deck of 66 cards  
   - Deal **5 cards face down** to each player (this is their hand)  
   - Place **6 cards face up** in a line on the table—this is the initial **Parade**  
   - Place the remaining deck face down as the **Draw Pile** near the Parade  
   - The end of the Parade (where new cards are added) is opposite the Draw Pile  
   - Determine a starting player; play proceeds clockwise

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   On a player’s turn, perform these steps in order:  
   1. **Play a Card (the Guest)**: Choose one card from your hand and place it face up at the **end of the Parade**.  
      - This played card does **not** count when evaluating the current length of the Parade for step 2.  
   2. **Check for Card Removal**:  
      - Let **N** = number of cards currently in the Parade **before** the Guest was played  
      - Let **V** = value of the Guest card  
      - If **V ≥ N**: No cards are removed. Skip to step 3.  
      - If **V < N**:  
        i. Starting from the end of the Parade (excluding the Guest), number the cards backwards: the last card before the Guest is position 1, the next is 2, etc.  
        ii. All cards in positions **greater than V** enter **removal mode**  
        iii. From these, the active player **must take**:  
            - All cards of the **same colour** as the Guest  
            - All cards with **value ≤ V**  
        iv. Place all taken cards **face up** in front of yourself, grouped by colour (values must remain visible)  
        v. **Close gaps**: Slide remaining Parade cards forward toward the front to fill any empty spaces  
        - Special Case: If a **0** is played, **all cards** in the Parade (before play) enter removal mode and are subject to the above rules  
   3. **Draw a Card**: Draw 1 card from the Draw Pile to restore your hand to 5 cards (if possible)

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Parade Growth**: The Parade grows by 1 card each turn when a card is played  
   - **Card Collection Trigger**: Playing a low-value card (relative to current Parade size) forces you to collect cards  
   - **Collection Rules**: Only cards in “removal mode” (positions > V) are eligible. From those, you take same colour OR value ≤ V  
   - **Hand Management**: Players maintain 5 cards until final round  
   - **Gaps Closed Immediately**: After removal, the Parade condenses—positioning is always contiguous

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - **End Game Triggers** (either condition ends the game after one final round):  
     - The **Draw Pile is exhausted**  
     - A player collects cards of **all 6 colours** during their turn  
   - **Final Round**:  
     - When either trigger occurs, **all players (including the triggerer)** get **one more turn**  
     - During this round, players **do not draw** after playing—hands decrease by 1 each turn  
     - Game ends when all players have **4 cards in hand**  
     - Note: Additional colour completions during final round do not extend play  
   - **Final Scoring Steps**:  
     1. Each player **discards 2 cards** from their hand  
     2. The remaining **2 cards** are added to their face-up collection in front of them  
     3. Cards still in the Parade are **discarded** and not scored  
   - **Per-Colour Scoring**:  
     For each of the 6 colours:  
     - Determine which player has the **most cards** in that colour (can be a tie)  
     - If a player has the **strict majority** (or ties for most):  
       - Their cards in that colour are worth **1 point each** (face down)  
     - All other players:  
       - Their cards in that colour are worth **their face value in points** (face up)  
     - **Exception for 2-Player Games**:  
       - A player scores **1 point per card** only if they have **at least 2 more cards** of that colour than the opponent  
       - Otherwise, they score the **sum of the values** of their cards in that colour  
   - **Total Score**: Sum of all colour scores  
   - **Winning**: The player with the **lowest total score** wins  
     - **Tiebreaker**: The player with **fewest total cards** wins

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Q: Does the played card count when checking parade length?**  
     A: No. Use the count **before** the card was added.  
   - **Q: What if multiple cards qualify under both rules (same colour and low value)?**  
     A: Take **all** that meet **either** condition—no overlap issues.  
   - **Q: How are cards arranged after collection?**  
     A: Group by colour, values visible (e.g., staggered). Helps with scoring transparency.  
   - **Q: Can you avoid taking eligible cards?**  
     A: No. You **must** take all cards that meet the criteria.  
   - **Q: What happens if the Parade is empty?**  
     A: Not possible—starts with 6 cards, and cards are only removed after playing, so minimum size is 0 only if all are taken. But playing a card adds one first.  
   - **Q: Do 0-value cards always remove all parade cards?**  
     A: Yes—since V = 0, all cards are in positions > 0 → all enter removal mode. Then you take any that match colour or value (≤0 → only 0s), but **all 0s and same-colour cards are taken**.
