## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Security alert! The hull has been breached—hostile intruders have planted bombs across the ship. You are part of an elite Bomb Defusal Team (BDT) tasked with neutralizing the threat before the ship is destroyed. Your mission: defuse enough bombs within 10 minutes to clear the central row and prevent total destruction. Work together quickly and strategically—time is running out!

### 2. Components  
- 54 Bomb Cards (numbered 1–6 points; higher = more difficult)

- 1 Cloth Dice Bag  
- 10-Minute Timer (physical or via the Renegade Games Companion App)  

*Note: Some rule variants reference 49 Bomb Cards or advanced cards—these are alternate configurations. The standard game uses 54 Bomb Cards.*

### 3. Setup  
**For Standard Difficulty (Training/Standard Level):**  
1. **Separate Components:**  
   - Separate Bomb Cards from Fuse Cards.  
   - Optionally remove the five 6-point Bomb Cards (2 double stacks, 3 large pyramids) for an easier game.  

2. **Deal Starting Cards:**  
   - Shuffle Bomb Cards.  
   - Deal **2 cards face-up** to each player (in front of them).  
     - *1-player game:* Deal **4 cards**.  
   - **Restriction:**  
     - If a player’s first card is worth 3 or 4 points, their second must be 1 or 2 points.  
     - *1-player game:* Must have at least **three different point values** among the four cards (e.g., 1,1,2,3 or 1,2,3,4).  
   - Redraw as needed; shuffle unused cards back into the deck.  

3. **Build Bomb Deck:**  
   - Form a face-down deck using the number of Bomb Cards based on player count and difficulty:  
     | Players | Standard | Advanced |  
     |--------|----------|----------|  
     | 1      | 21       | 26       |  
     | 2      | 21       | 26       |  
     | 3      | 21       | 26       |  
     | 4      | 26       | 31       |  
     | 5      | 31       | 36       |  
   - Return unused Bomb Cards to the box.  

4. **Create Central Row:**  
   - From the deck, deal **5 Bomb Cards face-up** in a row in the center.  

5. **Add Fuse Cards (Advanced Only):**  
   - For advanced difficulty, **shuffle 6 random Fuse Cards** into the bomb deck.  
   - Place the combined deck face-down next to the 5 face-up cards.  

6. **Prepare Dice:**  
   - Place all **25 dice** into the bag.  
   - Give the bag to any player to begin.  

7. **Start Timer:**  
   - Begin a **10-minute countdown** (app or physical timer).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows five steps. All players participate each turn.

#### Step 1: Draw and Roll Dice  
- The player holding the bag draws and rolls dice:  
  - **3–5 players:** Draw **number of players** dice.  
  - **2 players:** Draw **4 dice**.  
  - **1 player:** Draw **3 dice**.  
- Roll where all can see.  
- If too many drawn: return all, draw again.  
- If not enough: draw more until correct number.  
- If bag is empty when drawing: **lose immediately**.  

#### Step 2: Distribute Dice  
- Each player takes **one die** and places it on a **matching slot** on one of their Bomb Cards.  
  - *2-player game:* Each player takes **2 dice**.  
  - *1-player game:* Must place **all 3 dice**.  
- Dice must match the card’s icon requirements (color, number, equation, etc.).  
- **Illegal placement:** If discovered, **remove all dice** from that card and return them to the bag.  
- **Communication is key**—team must coordinate optimal placements.  

#### Step 3: Defuse Bombs  
- If **all requirements** on a Bomb Card are met:  
  1. Remove dice and return to bag.  
  2. Discard the Bomb Card (set aside face-down).  
  3. Choose **one** of the **5 face-up central cards** to replace it.  
  4. Draw a new card from the deck to refill the central row.  
  5. If the new card is a **Fuse Card**, resolve it immediately (see below), then draw another to refill.  
- *1- or 2-player games:* May defuse **before** placing all dice—allows strategic replacement mid-turn.  
- Multiple bombs defused in one turn: resolve **one at a time**.  

#### Step 4: Reroll Unused Dice  
- Any die **not taken** is rerolled by the bag holder.  
- After reroll, **each player** must remove **one die** from their cards that matches **either the color or number** of the rerolled die (if possible).  
- **Safe dice:** Dice under others in **Stacks or Pyramids** are **immune**.  
- Return **all removed dice + rerolled die** to the bag.  
- If multiple unused dice: resolve **one reroll at a time**, in any order.  

#### Step 5: Pass the Dice Bag  
- Pass the bag **clockwise** to the next player.  
- Next turn begins immediately.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Bomb Card Anatomy  
- **Point Value (1–6):** Upper-right corner. Scored if defused. Higher = harder.  
- **Dice Requirements:** Icons indicate what dice are needed (color, number, equations, etc.).  

#### Icon Reference  
| Icon | Meaning |  
|------|-------|  
| Solid color | Must match that color |  
| Solid number | Must match that number |  
| Color + number | Must match both |  
| Split color | Either color shown |  
| Split number | Either number shown |  
| Color or number | Match one or the other |  
| ? | Any die (wild) |  
| A or # | Player chooses color or number, but must be consistent across matching icons |  
| > or < | Adjacent dice must satisfy inequality (e.g., left die < right die) |  
| Same color | Dice must be same color |  
| Same number | Dice must be same number |  
| Different colors | Dice must be different colors |  
| Arrow (→) | Stacks: dice must be placed in order, stacked vertically |  
| Pyramid shape | Pyramid: bottom dice first; top die requires both below it |  

#### Special Bomb Types  

**Stacks**  
- One white slot; arrow indicates order.  
- Dice stacked **vertically** in sequence.  
- Bottom die = first requirement, etc.  
- If stack falls: **all dice returned to bag**.  

**Pyramids**  
- Two bottom slots, one top.  
- Bottom dice can be placed in any order.  
- Top die requires **both bottom dice** already placed.  
- If pyramid falls: **all dice returned to bag**.  

#### Fuse Cards (Advanced Difficulty)  
- Activate when drawn to refill the central row.  
- All players must return **one die** matching the **color or number** shown (if possible).  
- **Completed bombs are safe**—dice not removed.  
- After resolution, discard Fuse Card and draw a replacement.  
- **Scoring:** +2 points per Fuse Card activated.  

#### Illegal Moves & Errors  
- **Moving dice:** Not allowed.  
- **Placing a die that makes completion impossible:** Illegal. If discovered, **clear entire card**.  
- **Incorrect die on card:** Remove all dice from that card, return to bag.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Conditions  
- **Victory:** When the **last Bomb Card is taken from the central row**, stop the timer. **Win**.

  - *Exception: Insane Difficulty*—must defuse **all cards**, including personal ones.  
- **Loss:**  
  - Timer runs out before central row is cleared.  
  - Dice bag is empty when drawing.  

#### Scoring

- **+10 points** for winning  
- **+1 point** per **full 10 seconds** remaining on timer  
- **+ Points from all defused Bomb Cards**  
- **+2 points per Fuse Card activated** (advanced only)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move dice on my card?**  
  No. Once placed, dice cannot be moved.  

- **Can I place a die that makes the bomb impossible to finish?**  
  No. This is illegal. If discovered, clear the card.  

- **What happens to unused die after reroll?**  
  Return it to the bag with any removed dice.  

- **How many dice removed per reroll?**  
  One per player, if matching color or number.  

- **If a bomb is defused mid-turn, can I replace it before placing other dice?**  
  Yes—only in 1- or 2-player games.  

- **What if a Fuse Card is drawn after a bomb is defused?**  
  Yes, it activates. But **completed bombs are immune**.  

- **Insane difficulty: some players have cards, others don’t. What now?**  
  Continue rolling full player count. Only players with bombs must take dice. Unused dice trigger rerolls as normal.  

- **What if no Fuse Cards left to draw?**  
  In advanced variants: **lose** if you must draw one and can’t.
