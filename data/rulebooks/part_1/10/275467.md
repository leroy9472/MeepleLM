## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Letter Jam is a cooperative word deduction game. Each player has a secret letter that only others can see. The goal is to deduce your own hidden letters by interpreting clues formed from visible letters. Once all players believe they know their letters, they attempt to rearrange them into a valid word. The team wins if all or nearly all players successfully spell a real word using their letters, optionally enhanced with bonus letters or the wildcard.

### 2. Components  
- 64 letter cards  
- 1 wildcard card  
- 4 setup cards (for 2–6 players)  
- 1 pad of guessing sheets (60 sheets)  
- 6 pencils  
- 6 card stands  
- 6 red clue tokens  
- 9 green clue tokens  

### 3. Setup  
**Secret Word Setup:**  
1. Shuffle the deck of letter cards.  
2. Divide the deck roughly evenly among players.  
3. Each player uses their portion to form a 5-letter word (difficulty may be adjusted to 3–7 letters). Discard unused cards face down.  
4. Players may search through others’ discards if struggling.  
5. Once all have formed words, shuffle each 5-letter word and pass it to the right.  
6. Shuffle all discarded cards to form a draw deck; place it in the center.  
*(Optional: Use the Letter Jam app for word generation.)*

**Player Setup:**  
- Each player receives a face-down row of 5 (or adjusted number) letter cards.  
- Place the leftmost card in your card stand so it is visible to others but not to you.  
- Take a pencil and a guessing sheet. Fold the sheet to create a privacy screen.

**Setup Card & Nonplayer Stands:**  
- Choose the setup card matching the number of players. Place it in the center.  
- Place red and green clue tokens on designated spots.  
- Use all six card stands. For fewer than 6 players, the unused stands are nonplayer stands.  
- Give each nonplayer stand 1 green clue token.  
- Deal a stack of random cards (number per setup card) face down atop each nonplayer clue token.  
- Reveal the top card of each stack by placing it in the stand.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
**One Round Consists of:**  
1. **Observe Letters:** All players see 5 letters (from other players and nonplayer stands).  
2. **Choose a Cluegiver:**  
   - Players discuss potential clues.  
   - No information about specific players’ letters may be shared.  
   - All agree on one cluegiver.  
3. **Take a Clue Token:**  
   - First clue: take a red token.  
   - Subsequent clues: take a green token (see *Counting Clues*).  
4. **Spell the Clue:**  
   - Cluegiver uses numbered tokens to spell a word using visible letters (including nonplayer and wildcard).  
   - The same letter card may be used multiple times.  
   - Wildcard may represent one letter (used multiple times if needed), but not multiple different letters.  
5. **Record the Clue:**  
   - Players whose letters are used write the clue on their sheet, replacing their own letter with “?”.  
   - Keep sheets hidden.  
6. **Guess Your Letter:**  
   - Based on position in the clue, write possible identities for your letter.  
7. **Decide to Move On:**  
   - If confident, tip your card face down and record your guess at the bottom of your sheet.  
   - If unsure, keep the same letter for the next round.  
   - Players who move on return their card to their row (without looking) and advance their stand right.  
8. **Prepare for Next Round:**  
   - Players who moved on take the next letter from their row.  
   - If a nonplayer stand was used, discard its card and replace it with the next from its stack.  
   - When a nonplayer stack is exhausted, its green token is freed and placed on the setup card (grants extra clue).  
   - Return all numbered tokens to the center.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
**Clue Discussion Rules:**  
- **You may say:**  
  - Length of clue.  
  - Number of player letters used (not which ones).  
  - Number of nonplayer letters used (not which ones).  
  - Number of bonus letters used (not which ones).  
  - Whether the wildcard is used.  
- **You may NOT say:**  
  - Which players are helped.  
  - That your clue is obscure, a name, or unusual.  
  - That a player has a specific letter.  
  - That a letter appears multiple times.  

**Wildcard:**  
- Can represent one letter in a clue.  
- May be used multiple times in the same clue.  
- Cluegiver must not reveal what letter it represents.  

**Bonus Letters:**  
- When a player uses their last original letter and returns it, they draw a new one from the deck.  
- Their stand is placed in front of their row to indicate they are on bonus letters.  
- When this new letter is used in a clue, the player guesses aloud, then looks at the card.  
  - Correct guess: card becomes a bonus letter, placed near the wildcard.  
  - Incorrect guess: discard the card.  
- Draw a new card regardless.  
- Bonus letters can be used in clues like nonplayer letters. After use, they are discarded.  
- Can be used at endgame to help spell final word.  
- No limit on number of bonus letters.  

**Counting Clues (Token Rules):**  
- **4–6 players:**  
  - First clue: take red token.  
  - Subsequent clues: take green token.  
  - Once all red tokens are taken, the central green token becomes available.  
- **3 players:** First two clues use red tokens; after all reds are gone, three green tokens become available.  
- **2 players:** First three clues use red tokens; after all reds are gone, three green tokens become available.  
- Nonplayer stands contribute green tokens when their stacks are exhausted.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Conditions:**  
- No clue tokens remain for the next round.  
- OR all players agree no more clues are needed.  

**Final Word Formation:**  
- On guessing sheet, players write down their best guess for each letter.  
- Rearrange face-down cards to spell a valid word.  
- May replace any card with:  
  - A bonus letter  
  - The wildcard  
- Multiple middle-table cards may be used, but each by only one player.  
- Example: If guesses are B, N, H, C, M, but can’t spell a word, replace M with wildcard to spell BENCH.  

**Revealing Words:**  
- Players reveal their words one at a time (recommended: most confident first).  
- Word does not need to match original secret word.  
- Must be a real word whose meaning you know.  
- Words like HEROES (from HORSE + bonus E) are valid.  

**Winning:**  
- If all or nearly all players spell a valid word, the team wins.  
- Victory is shared equally.  

**Scoring (Optional):**  
- **Incorrect word:** 1 point per correctly guessed original letter.  
- **Correct word:**  
  - 3 × original word length  
  - +1 per letter beyond original length (e.g., 6-letter word from 5-letter original = +1)  
  - +1 per unused green clue token on setup card  
- Example: Original word HORSE (5 letters), spelled HEROES (6 letters) with bonus E, 2 green tokens left:  
  - Score: (3×5) + 1 + 2 = 18 points  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use my own letter in a clue?** No. Only letters you can see.  
- **Can I give a 10-letter clue?** Yes. Use imaginary tokens; describe positions clearly.  
- **I see two Rs. Can I use both?** Yes. You may use the same card twice or two different R cards.  
- **Are gray letters on my sheet not in the deck?** Yes. Use the wildcard if needed.  
- **Can players have different word lengths?** Yes. But longer words require more clues.  
- **Can I say my clue helps those who need it most?** You can say you have a good clue, but not who it helps.  
- **Can I move on from an unsure letter?** Yes, if your letter was used in any clue (current or past). No going back.  
- **Can I use info from others’ guesses?** Yes. Saying you’re sure/unsure is allowed and helpful. Only bonus letter guesses are spoken aloud.  
- **Can I make a smaller word at the end?** No. Use the wildcard or bonus letters to complete your original-length word.
