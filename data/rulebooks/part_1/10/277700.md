## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Merchants Cove is a competitive board game set in a bustling coastal town where players take on the role of merchants vying for wealth and influence. Over three rounds, players produce goods, recruit townsfolk, manage adventurers, and sell goods at piers to earn gold. The player with the most gold after Final Scoring wins. In case of a tie, victory is determined first by unsold goods on the Sale Shelf, then by fewest corruption cards, and finally shared if still tied.

2. Components  
- Main board with clock, piers, and faction halls  
- Player shop boards with action spaces  
- Goods (small and large, multiple colors)  
- Adventurers (by faction: Warrior, Bard, Wizard, Noble, Rogue, etc.)  
- Townsfolk cards (13 factions, 12 per faction)  
- Corruption cards  
- Timepieces and Gold trackers  
- Peddler module (optional solo/2-player AI)  
- Rogue cards (numbered 1–21, B1–B5, P1–P3, DIY)  
- Scenario modules (e.g., Halls of Plenty, Dragon Island)

3. Setup  
- Place board, clock, and piers.  
- Shuffle Townsfolk deck and place five face-up in the Town Square.  
- Each player receives a shop board, Timepiece, Gold tracker, and starting resources.  
- Place two Adventurers on each Sailing Boat.  
- Draw and resolve the Rogue card for the round (place in center).  
- Set Market Phase indicator to "12".  
- For Peddler: Place Peddler board, set Timepiece on clock, draw initial Peddler card and fill Customer Pool.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of four phases:

1. **Arrival Phase**  
   - Place 2 Adventurers on each Sailing Boat.  
   - Apply Arrival Rule from the current Rogue card (e.g., Kraken removes a Customer; Doppelgangers place into Faction Hall).

2. **Production Phase**  
   - Players take turns in Timepiece order.  
   - Choose an action: Produce Goods, Recruit Townsfolk, Activate Staff, or Secure Sponsorship.  
   - Move Timepiece according to action cost (in Hours).  
   - When a player’s Timepiece passes the Adventurer indicator, load an Adventurer from the bag onto a Sailing Boat.  
   - When a boat is filled, Dock it at an empty Pier on the same side of the island.  
   - When all Piers are filled, set Market Phase indicator after the leading Timepiece.

3. **Market Phase**  
   - Players sell Goods from their Sale Shelves to matching Customers at Piers:  
     - Bazaar (left): Large Goods only  
     - Grand Plaza (center): Small Goods only  
     - Black Market (right): Both sizes; draw 1 Corruption card when selling here  
   - Value = base price × number of matching Customers at Pier  
   - Gain Gold from active Market Phase Sponsorship icons  
   - Resolve Peddler sales if applicable (left to right; sell immediately even at lower value)

4. **Cleanup Phase**  
   - Return all Adventurers from Piers to the Adventurer bag  
   - Discard the rightmost Townsfolk card from the Town Square and refill  
   - Reset boats to Sailing positions  
   - Reset clock: Move Mouse token, advance round marker, reposition Timepieces  
   - Skip in Round 3; proceed to Final Scoring

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Rogue Cards**: Modify game rules each round. Examples:  
  - *Pirates*: No effect  
  - *Cultists*: Peddler always sells to them, drawing Corruption  
  - *Thieves/Robbers*: During Market Phase, each Rogue at a Pier counts as a Customer of each color not present  
  - *Kraken*: When drawn, return to bag, remove one Customer from a Sailing Boat and discard to bay  
  - *Raider*: When docking a boat with Rogues, may draw 1 Corruption to activate a Townsfolk ability, then discard it  
  - *Mind Controllers*: When drawn and placed, may draw 1 Corruption to return one Customer from that boat to bag  
  - *Backers*: When drawn, must place Rogue to force a boat to dock if possible  
  - *The Thief*: In Cleanup, leave Rogues on Piers (do not return to bag)  
  - *Conspirators*: When a boat with Rogues docks, all players may use Frame Action; penalty applies only to player on left  
  - *Witches*: Goods sold at a Pier with Rogues have base value reduced by 1  
  - *Loan Sharks*: When docking a boat with Rogues, may move 1 matching small Good from supply to Sale Shelf; if not, others draw Corruption  
  - *Fence*: When docking a boat with Rogues, may draw 1 Corruption to sell any 1 Good at 3× base value  
  - *Angry Paladin*: Final Scoring: Corruption gives positive Gold, Faction icons give negative Gold  
  - *Genies*: When docking a boat with Rogues, may draw 1 Corruption per Rogue to activate any 1 Staff Ability (no Townsfolk needed)  
  - *DIY*: When drawing a Rogue, place it aside on Dragon’s Island; when a boat docks on that side, replace one Adventurer with the Rogue  

- **Townsfolk Abilities**: Activated when recruited or via effects (e.g., Raiders, Genies). Examples:  
  - *Peddler*: Recruits Townsfolk, gains Goods, draws Adventurers  
  - *Locals, Mercenaries, Sailors*: Common in multiple Rogue effects  
  - *Artisans, Officials, Legends, Underworld, Lawyers, etc.*: Matched to specific Rogue cards  

- **Peddler AI Rules**:  
  - Operates as a second player using card-driven actions  
  - Draws two cards to form action sequence (left and right halves)  
  - Resolves action based on combined icons and multiplier  
  - Pays action cost once, regardless of multiplier  
  - Uses Location icons (Left/Right, Inner/Outer) to resolve ambiguity  
  - In Market Phase, sells left-to-right, draws 1 Corruption total at Black Market  
  - In Cleanup, shuffles all cards into deck  

6. Scoring & End Game  
After Round 3:  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - For each Faction icon on Townsfolk or Corruption cards: gain Gold = number of Adventurers in matching Faction Hall  
  - For each Corruption icon: lose Gold = number of Adventurers in the Lair  
  - Exception: *Angry Paladin* inverts this (Corruption = positive, Faction icons = negative)  
- **Victory**: Most Gold wins. Tiebreakers:  
  1. Most unsold Goods on Sale Shelf  
  2. Fewest Corruption cards  
  3. Shared victory if still tied  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Empty Adventurer Bag**: If bag is empty during Dragon Island or Kraken effect, move all Adventurers from Dragon Island into the bag before drawing.  
- **Clock Mechanics**:  
  - If players pass Market Phase token, place their Timepieces on top (do not reorder) when Market Phase starts.  
  - If Market Phase token is at "12" when passed, do not move it.  
  - Mice tokens may be passed during rounds 2 and 3.  
- **Peddler Sale Shelf**: After Cleanup, slide Goods left to preserve order.  
- **2-Seater Boat**: If all Piers are filled and a 2-Seater still has an Adventurer, send that Adventurer to Faction Hall or Lair.  
- **Faction Leaders (Module)**: Count as 1 Adventurer for Innkeeper majorities; count as 2 during Market Phase scoring.  
- **Rogue Card Conflicts**: Rulebook takes precedence over card icons (e.g., Raiders, Mind Controllers, Backers setup).  
- **Blacklisted Scenario**: Start with 3 Rogues in bag (not 4).  
- **Something Fishy Scenario**: Lose if no Rogue in matching Faction Hall when returning Townsfolk card.
