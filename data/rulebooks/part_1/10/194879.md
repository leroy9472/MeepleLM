## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the 25th century, a human expedition crashes on the mysterious planet Artemia. The survivors (the Hunted) must survive long enough for a rescue mission to arrive. One player takes the role of the alien Creature, which seeks to assimilate the survivors into the planet’s ecosystem.  

The Hunted win if the Rescue counter reaches the Victory space.  
The Creature wins if the Assimilation counter reaches the Victory space first.

2. Components  
- 10 Place cards (The Lair, Jungle, River, Beach, Rover, Swamp, Shelter, Wreck, Source, Artefact)  
- Rescue counter (blue) and Assimilation counter (pink)  
- 3 Will counters per Hunted player  
- 3 Hunt tokens: Creature, Target, Artemia  
- Marker counter (yellow, for the Beach)  
- Hunt deck (Hunt cards)  
- Survival deck (Survival cards)  
- Reserve of Place cards #6–10 (Swamp, Shelter, Wreck, Source, Artefact)  

3. Setup  
1. Place the Rescue and Assimilation counters on the board space corresponding to the total number of players.  
2. Arrange the 10 Place cards face-up in two rows of five (1–5 top, 6–10 bottom) in front of the Creature. Cards are adjacent if they share a horizontal or vertical edge.  
3. Place the Marker counter next to the Beach card.  
4. Form a Reserve of Place cards #6–10, with quantity based on player count (e.g., one copy per Hunted player).  
5. Shuffle and place the Survival deck near the Hunted.  
6. Shuffle and place the Hunt deck near the Creature.  
7. The Creature takes the 3 Hunt tokens and draws 3 Hunt cards.  
8. Each Hunted takes 3 Will counters, a full set of Place cards #1–5, and draws 1 Survival card.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn proceeds through four phases:  

**Phase 1: Exploration**  
- Each Hunted simultaneously plays one Place card face-down.  
- Before playing, a Hunted may:  
  - *Resist*: Lose 1 or 2 Will to retrieve 2 or 4 Place cards from their discard pile.  
  - *Give Up*: Regain all Will and discarded Place cards, but advance the Assimilation counter 1 space.  

**Phase 2: Hunting**  
- The Creature may place:  
  - Creature token (always allowed)  
  - Target token (if a played Hunt card has the Target symbol)  
  - Artemia token (if a Hunt card has the Artemia symbol OR the Rescue counter is on an “A” space)  
- Multiple tokens may be stacked on the same Place.  
- The Creature may play one Hunt card during this phase (unless specified otherwise).  

**Phase 3: Reckoning**  
- All Hunted reveal their Place cards. Resolve effects clockwise from the player left of the Creature:  
  - **No token**: Use the Place power OR retrieve 1 card from discard pile.  
  - **Target token**: Apply Hunt card effect, then use Place power OR retrieve 1 card.  
  - **Artemia token**: Discard 1 Place card from hand; cannot use Place power or retrieve card.  
  - **Creature token**: Lose 1 Will; cannot use Place power or retrieve card. Advance Assimilation counter 1 space.  
- If any Hunted loses their 3rd Will:  
  - Advance Assimilation counter 1 additional space.  
  - That Hunted regains all discarded Place cards and 3 Will counters.  

**Phase 4: End-of-Turn Actions**  
- Each Hunted discards their revealed Place card face-up (visible to Creature).  
- Creature retrieves all Hunt tokens.  
- Creature draws Hunt cards up to a hand of 3.  
- Move Rescue counter forward 1 space.  
- Begin next turn.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Hunt Cards**: Played during specified phase. One per turn unless Tracking is played. Discarded after use.  
- **Survival Cards**: One per turn per Hunted, during specified phase. Discarded after use.  
- **Card Timing**: If Hunt and Survival cards are played in the same phase, the Creature decides resolution order.  
- **Token Stacking**: Multiple tokens on one Place combine effects.  
- **Adjacency**: Horizontal/vertical only.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Rescue Counter**: Advances 1 space each Phase 4.  
- **Assimilation Counter**: Advances when:  
  - At least one Hunted is caught by Creature token (1 space)  
  - A Hunted loses their 3rd Will (1 extra space)  
  - A Hunted Gives Up (1 space)  
  - Specific card effects (e.g., Anticipation, VACCINE reverses it)  
- Game ends immediately when either counter reaches the Victory space.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Beach/Wreck Power Limit**: Only one Hunted per turn may activate the power (move Rescue counter). Others may retrieve 1 discard. Powers may stack.  
- **The Lair**: Cannot retrieve itself from discard during Reckoning (not yet discarded).  
- **The Artefact**: Cannot be copied. When played, resolve both Place cards one at a time. If both River and Artefact powers are available, choose one.  
- **Empty Decks**: If Survival deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form a new deck.  
- **Expert Variant**: A Hunted who loses their 3rd Will regains only 2 Will; must Give Up or be healed to regain the third.  
- **Hunt Card Effects**:  
  - *STASIS*: Prevents Rescue counter movement in Phase 4.  
  - *TRACKING*: Allows 2 Hunt cards next turn.  
  - *FLASHBACK*: Copies last discarded Hunt card.  
  - *CLONE*: Target token acts as a second Creature token.  
- **Survival Card Interactions**:  
  - *DODGE*: Avoids Creature token effects.  
  - *DETECTOR*: Avoids Artemia token effects.  
  - *SMOKESCREEN*: Hides discarded Place cards until end of turn.  
  - *STRIKE BACK*: Removes 2 random Hunt cards from Creature’s hand to bottom of deck.
