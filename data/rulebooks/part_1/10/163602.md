## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
XCOM is a cooperative board game where players take on specialized roles within the XCOM organization, defending Earth from an alien invasion. The goal is to prevent global panic from spreading while researching alien technology, defending the base, completing missions, and ultimately defeating a final invasion mission. The game is lost if two continents fall into panic or the XCOM base is destroyed.

2. Components  
- Role cards: Central Officer, Chief Scientist, Squad Leader, Commander  
- Budget Sheet with numbered credit track (1–24)  
- Emergency Funding card with bracketed credit values (S markers indicate start)  
- Continent boards: North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia  
- Crisis deck  
- Mission deck  
- Enemy deck  
- Tech cards  
- Success tokens  
- Assets (Soldiers, Scientists, Satellites, Interceptors)  
- Recruitment pool  
- Threat die (red) and standard dice  
- Invasion Plan tracker  
- Panic level indicators per continent  
- UFOs and Orbit track  
- Base damage markers ("!")

3. Setup  
- Assign roles: Each player takes a role card and associated assets/reserves.  
  - Central Officer: Manages Satellites, Threat level (set to "1"), UFOs, and Earth’s orbit.  
  - Chief Scientist: Manages Scientists, Tech cards, Success tokens, and research labs.  
  - Squad Leader: Manages Soldiers, Mission cards, Enemy deck, Base damage, and Invasion Plan.  
  - Commander: Manages Interceptors, Crisis deck, HQ assets, Panic levels, and Credit pool.  
- Place one of each Soldier type and two Interceptors in the Recruitment pool.  
- Shuffle Crisis, Mission, and Enemy decks.  
- Set Threat level to "1".  
- Place UFOs on continents as indicated by scenario or setup rules.  
- Set Base damage to 0; place red marker at "1" on Threat track.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of two phases:

**Timed Phase**  
1. Budget: Commander gains the number of Credits shown on the current Budget Sheet value.  
2. Crisis: Commander draws 2 Crisis cards, selects one to resolve, discards the other.  
3. Deploy Interceptors: Commander may deploy Interceptors to any continent.  
4. Emergency Funding: Commander may take any number of Credits from the Emergency Funding card (values in brackets). Mark used S spaces.  
5. Technology Available: Chief Scientist refills hand to 6 Tech cards.  
6. Assign Research: Chief Scientist assigns Scientists to Lab I, II, or III with a Tech card to research.  
7. Choose Mission: Squad Leader draws 2 Mission cards, chooses one, and places required Enemy cards face-down.  
8. Deploy Squad to Mission: Squad Leader flips Enemies and assigns up to 4 Soldiers.  
9. Enemy in the Base: Squad Leader draws top Enemy card and adds it to the Base.  
10. Defend the Base: Squad Leader may assign Soldiers to defend.  
11. UFOs: Central Officer places new UFOs as indicated; UFOs already in orbit may descend.  
12. Deploy Satellites: Central Officer may deploy Satellites to orbit.  
13. Ending Timed Phase: Players complete any "Timed" action on cards.

**Resolution Phase**  
1. Audit the Budget: Commander pays 1 Credit for each deployed Soldier, Scientist, Satellite, and Interceptor.  
   - Deficit: For each unpaid unit, increase panic on the most panicked continent by 1.  
   - Surplus: Commander may purchase Soldiers or Interceptors from Recruitment pool.  
   - Discard excess Credits beyond maximum (24).  
2. Resolve Crises: Commander draws and resolves Crisis cards one at a time.  
3. Resolve Tasks: Roll dice for all active tasks (Mission, Base Defense, Global Defense, Orbital Defense, Research).  
   - Roll one die per unit assigned + one red Threat die.  
   - Threat level starts at "1" and increases by 1 for each subsequent roll during the same task (resets between tasks).  
   - Base and Mission tasks do not reset Threat level between rolls.  
4. Research:  
   - Success: Add a Success token to the Tech card.  
   - Completion: Give the Tech card to the appropriate player.  
   - Loss: Success tokens remain; research continues next round.  
5. Orbital Defense:  
   - Success: Remove one UFO from orbit.  
   - Loss: Destroy one Satellite; for each UFO in orbit, increase panic on the least panicked continent.  
6. Global Defense:  
   - Success: Remove one UFO from the defending continent.  
   - Loss: Destroy one Interceptor; for each UFO over the continent, increase panic on that continent.  
7. Base Defense:  
   - One Soldier may be assigned per Enemy skill.  
   - Extra die if Soldier matches gold icon on Enemy.  
   - Extra die for Elite Soldiers.  
   - Success: Add Success token to Enemy card; if killed, give Salvage to Chief Scientist.  
   - Loss: Killed Soldiers are removed; each Enemy applies 1 damage to Base; all Enemies discarded.  
   - When Base reaches a red marker, apply critical effect from Invasion Plan.  
8. Mission:  
   - Same assignment rules as Base Defense.  
   - Success:  
     - Enemy Task: Add Success token; if killed, produce Salvage.  
     - Mission Task: Add Success token.  
     - Completion: Resolve mission reward.  
   - Loss: Assigned Soldiers are killed; Success tokens remain for continued progress.  
9. Input Panic Levels:  
   - Any continent at orange panic level has its UFOs moved to orbit.  
10. Refresh:  
   - Return units to Reserves.  
   - Flip tokens on Reserve cards.  
   - Restock all discarded cards (Mission, Crisis, Enemy, Tech).  
11. UFOs in Orbit: May disrupt communications next round and may descend to a continent.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Threat Level**: Starts at "1" and increases by 1 for each die roll within a single task. Resets between tasks.  
- **Dice Rolling**: Each unit contributes 1 die; add the red Threat die. Successes are counted based on Threat level (exact mechanic not specified, but implied via probability charts).  
- **Panic Management**: Each continent has a panic track. If two continents reach maximum panic (implied as "falling"), game is lost.  
- **Credit Economy**: Budget Sheet determines income. Emergency Funding allows borrowing with potential consequences.  
- **Progression**: Research and missions advance through Success tokens. Completed tech cards provide advantages.  
- **Alien Escalation**: UFOs trigger defenses; if not handled, they increase panic or damage base.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game does not use scoring. Victory and loss conditions are binary.  
- **Loss Conditions**:  
  - Two continents fall into panic (reach maximum level).  
  - XCOM base is destroyed (reaches final damage threshold).  
- **Win Condition**:  
  - Defeat the Final Mission (flip and complete the mission on the back of the Invasion Plan card).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Does Threat level reset between rolls in Base Defense or Mission?  
  A: No. Threat level increases per roll within the same task and does not reset during that task.  
- Q: Can Emergency Funding be used multiple times?  
  A: Yes, but each use consumes an S marker; once all S markers are used, Emergency Funding is no longer available.  
- Q: What happens when a continent's UFOs go to orbit?  
  A: When a continent reaches orange panic, all its UFOs are moved to Earth's orbit.  
- Q: Can you exceed the maximum credit limit during Budget phase?  
  A: No. Excess Credits beyond 24 must be discarded after Audit phase.  
- Q: Can you assign more than 4 Soldiers to a mission?  
  A: No. Maximum of 4 Soldiers may be assigned to a single mission.  
- Q: What happens to Success tokens on incomplete tasks?  
  A: They remain on the card and carry over to the next round.
