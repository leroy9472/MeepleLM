### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Specialists  
- **Missionary**: +1 Colonist when placed via Colonist Dock  
- **Merchant**: +$5 when placed via Colonist Dock; counts as 2 in Merchant Shipping  
- **Soldier**: Removes enemy colonists in Warfare; generates $ on successful Discovery  
- **Captain**: Counts as 2 in Merchant Shipping and Discovery  
- **Builder**: +4 VP (1st), +2 VP (2nd) in colony scoring; reduces Capital Building cost by $5  

#### Discovery  
- Expedition requires total strength ≥ Natives on tile  
- Success: claim tile, gain VPs, plunder (money, goods, soldiers)

     - 2nd place: 2 VP (+2 VP per Builder present)  
     - Tie for 1st: both get 2 VP  
     - Other ties: no points  

2. **Final Scoring (End of Game):**  
   - **Capital Buildings**: Score VPs shown  
   - **Discovery Tiles/Cards**: Score VPs shown  
   - **Economy**: VPs = total trade good income (from Income Phase)  
   - **Total VPs determine winner**

**Tiebreakers (in order):**
