## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In Kanagawa, players are disciples of the Master Hokusai, learning to create beautiful prints. The goal is to gain the most Harmony points by building a Print (your artwork) and improving your Studio, earning Diplomas based on composition and mastery. Victory comes through strategic use of resources, timing, and harmonious design across Seasons, Subjects, and Studio upgrades.

### 2. Components  
- 1 School board  
- 4 Starting tiles  
- 72 Lesson cards (18 per color: green/Tree, blue/Animal, red/Character, yellow/Building)  
- 1 Grand Master pawn  
- 1 Assistant pawn  
- 19 Diploma tiles (sorted by color into Print and Studio rows)  
- 15 Brush pawns  
- 3 Storm tokens  

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the School board in the center.  
2. Shuffle Lesson cards into a deck; place beside the board.  
3. Sort Diploma tiles by color into two rows above the board:  
   - **Top row**: Diplomas for Print (based on subjects in your Print)  
   - **Bottom row**: Diplomas for Studio (based on elements in your Studio)  
   - Within each color, sort by Harmony value (lowest to highest).  
4. Randomly distribute one Starting tile to each player.  
5. Each player places 2 Brush pawns in front of them (not yet in Studio).  
6. Choose first player; they take both the **Grand Master** and **Assistant** pawns.  

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A round consists of three steps:  

#### Step 1: Follow the Teachings of the Master  
- The first player (Grand Master) draws as many Lesson cards as there are players still at school.  
- Places them face-up or face-down on the next available row of the School board, according to space indicators.  

#### Step 2: Broaden Your Knowledge or Put It into Practice  
Players take turns clockwise:  
- **Broaden Your Knowledge**: Pass. You stay in school and wait for more cards to be added.  
- **Put It into Practice**: Leave school and:  
  a) Choose a full column of cards from the School board and take all cards in it.  
  b) Immediately add all taken cards to your Studio and/or Print (order of your choice).  
  c) Trigger any immediate effects (Brush, Assistant).  
  d) Move Brushes if needed (using Arrow icons).  
  e) Expand Print if possible (matching Brush + Landscape).  
  f) Check and optionally claim **Diploma(s)** you now qualify for.  

> **Note**: If you are the last player in school, you **must** take a column (even if only one card).  

#### Step 3: New Lesson  
- If players remain in school, the first player draws as many cards as there are remaining players.  
- Add them to the next row of the board, aligned under existing columns.  
- Return to Step 2.  

When all players have left school:  
- The player with the **Assistant pawn** takes the **Grand Master pawn**.  
- That player becomes first player of the next round.  
- Begin a new round with Step 1.  

> **Endgame Trigger**: When the last card is drawn from the deck, all remaining players must take a column (even if fewer columns than players). Game ends after this round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Studio vs. Print  
- **Studio**: Flip card upside-down; place under bottom half of Starting tile. Use for abilities and resources.  
- **Print**: Keep card right-side-up; place to the right of Starting tile. Use for scoring and Diplomas.  

#### Brush Mechanics  
- **Place a Brush**: At any time during your turn, place an uncommitted Brush (from in front of you) onto an empty Landscape icon in your Studio.  
- **Move a Brush**: Use one **Arrow (↔)** symbol per Brush moved. Each Arrow can be used only once per round.  
- **Painting Rule**: Each Brush can be used **once per round** to enable painting a card with matching Landscape.  
- **One Brush per Landscape**: No Landscape icon can host more than one Brush.  

#### Diploma Rules  
- **One per color**: You may claim only **one Diploma tile per color group** (Print or Studio).  
- **Immediate Claim**: When you qualify during "Put into Practice", you must immediately decide to take or leave a Diploma.  
- **Chaining Allowed**: Gaining a Diploma may grant new Studio elements (e.g., Brush, Arrow), which can trigger **additional Diploma claims** in the same turn.  
- **No duplicates**: Cannot take multiple Diplomas of the same color, even if higher value.  

#### Carryover Cards  
- For each **“Keep a Lesson card” (hand icon)** in your Studio, you may keep **one Lesson card** from round to round.  
- Card remains hidden (if face-down) or visible (if face-up).  
- Can carry the same card over multiple rounds.  

#### End of Game Conditions  
Game ends at the end of a round if:  
- The **deck is empty** (after all players take final cards), **OR**  
- One or more players have **11 Lesson cards in their Print** (plus Starting tile).  

Before scoring:  
- Use **Storm tokens** to change the Season on any card in your Print to any Season of your choice.  
- Place each Storm token on one card.  

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Final score is the sum of:  

- **+1** per Lesson card in your **Print** (including Starting tile)  
- **+1** per card in your **longest sequence of identical Seasons** (including Starting tile)  
- **+** or **–** from symbols on **Lesson cards in Print and Studio** (e.g., +1, –1)  
- **+** Harmony points from **Diploma tiles taken**  
- **+2** for the player with the **Grand Master pawn**  

> **Tie**: Players tie and share victory.
