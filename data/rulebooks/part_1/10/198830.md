# Heroes of Land, Air & Sea — Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In the world of Aughmoore, ancient factions vie for dominance across land, sea, and sky. Players take control of one of several unique races—each with distinct strengths, preferred terrain, and victory paths—competing to achieve supremacy through exploration, expansion, exploitation, or extermination. The game ends when one of the four "X-Objectives" is met, triggering final scoring.

**Victory Conditions (The 4 X-Objectives):**
- **eXplore**: All Land Exploration Tokens have been revealed.
- **eXpand**: A player has placed all their Serfs and Warriors into play.
- **eXploit**: A player has built all three of their Towers.
- **eXterminate**: A player destroys another player’s Capital City.

After the first objective is triggered, all players complete the current round. Final scoring determines the winner.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of three phases:

### 1. Action Selection Phase
Starting with the First Player and proceeding clockwise, each player:
- Places one Action Token on an available action space.
- Performs that action immediately.
- Play continues until all players have used both Action Tokens (2 actions per round).

There are two categories of actions:
- **Capital Actions** (Recruit, Build, Research, Tax) – can be **Followed** by other players using a Serf.
- **Command Actions** (March, Sail, Fly, Cast) – can be **Mustered** by the active player using a Serf to perform a second Command Action.

### 2. Collection Phase (Simultaneous)
All players:
- Collect Resources based on controlled Regions:
  - +1 Resource per Region (type depends on terrain: Plains=Food, Mountains=Ore, Forests=Mana)
  - +1 per Serf in a completed Building Worker Space
  - +2 per Tower
- Draw 1 Spell Card into Spell Library (discard down to Hand Limit if needed).
- Rotate exhausted Scribed Spells 90° to reset them.

### 3. Reset Phase
- Remove Action Tokens and Serfs from Action Slots back to Courtyard.
- Pass First Player Token clockwise.
- Begin next round.

#### Capital Actions (Can be Followed)

**Research Spells**
Choose one:
- **Conjure**: Draw 3 Spell Cards, keep as many as needed to reach Hand Limit (based on CC Level), discard the rest face down.
