### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Rats of Wistar*, players take on the roles of intelligent rats who escaped from a laboratory and now lead their families in a five-day challenge to become the leader of the colony. The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VP) by digging rooms, building beds, exploring the Farm, completing missions, claiming objectives, and creating inventions.

The player with the most VP at the end of 5 rounds wins. In case of a tie, the player first in turn order wins.
