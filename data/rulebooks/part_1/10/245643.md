### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### 1. Play a Card and Move  
- Must play **leftmost or rightmost card** from hand (5 cards).
- **Starter Cards**:
  - Number (1–5): Move 1 upright adventurer that many spaces.
  - +/–1: Move 1 adventurer forward or backward 1 space.
  - Die: Roll die, move that number of spaces.
- **Horus Cards** (gained during play):
  - *1–X*: Choose number in range; move 1 adventurer.
  - *1–Die*: Roll die, choose number from 1 to result.
  - *Advance All Adventurers*: Move all upright adventurers same number of spaces. Choose **1** to perform action.
  - *Advance Last to Second Last*: Move furthest-back adventurer to same space as next furthest. Perform action there.
  - *1 Adventurer Less*: Move 1–3 spaces; may claim treasure tile with 1 fewer adventurer than required.
- **Movement Rules**:
  - Only upright adventurers can be moved.
  - Skip empty spaces (no tile).
  - Starting from empty space: first move goes to next tile.
  - Passing an Anubis statue: immediately place your lying-down adventurer upright on the start space.
  - Cannot stop on Anubis statue spaces.

#### 2. Perform an Action  
Action depends on tile type where movement ends.

- **Treasure Tile**:
  - Compare number of your adventurers on tile to icon count.
  - If equal or more, take tile and score VP shown.
  - Check space: if it has an icon, draw top Temple tile of matching type and place face-up.
    - Place all adventurers on new tile (no action triggered).
  - If no icon, adventurers remain on empty space.

- **Temple Tile**:
  - **Scarab**: Take 1 face-down Scarab tile (score VP at end).
  - **Wild Treasure Tile**: Take 1 Wild Tile (use in sets).
  - **Scarab or Wild**: Choose one.
  - **Favor of Horus**: Take top card from **one** matching Eye-level stack on Horus board. Place in **middle** of hand.
  - **Tunnel**: Immediately move adventurer to next Tunnel tile toward center. If none, no move. If passing Anubis statue, activate your lying-down adventurer.

- **Horus Tile**:
  - Take either:
    - 1 Key, or
    - Top Horus card from stack matching tile’s Eye number.
  - If taking card, place in **middle** of hand — **no card drawn in Step 3**.

- **Osiris Tile**:
  - Immediately move adventurer forward number shown.
  - Perform action at final tile.
  - Never stop on Osiris tile.

#### 3. Draw a Card  
- If you **did not** gain a Horus card during your turn, draw 1 Starter Card and place it in **middle** of remaining 4 cards.
- If draw pile is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new draw pile (includes Horus cards).
- After this step, you always have 5 cards — unless you took a Horus card (then skip draw).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after a full round in which **2 or more adventurers** are in the Tomb Chamber. Final scoring:

1. **Adventurer Position**:
   - Score VP shown on **wall scarab** next to each upright adventurer’s space.
   - Adventurers on start or Anubis statues: 0 VP.

2. **Sarcophagi**:
   - First adventurer in Tomb Chamber: takes 5 VP sarcophagus.
   - Second: takes 3 VP sarcophagus.
   - Same player may take both (requires 2 keys).

3. **Keys**:
   - Each unused key: 1 VP.

4. **Treasure Sets**:
   - A set = 1 Vase, 1 Statue, 1 Jewelry.
   - Wild Tiles can substitute, but **no set can have more than 2 Wilds**.
   - **No set of all Wilds allowed**.
   - Scoring:
     - 1 set: 3 VP
     - 2 sets: 7 VP
     - 3 sets: 12 VP
     - 4 sets: 18 VP
     - 5 sets: 25 VP
     - 6 sets: 33 VP
     - 7 sets: 42 VP
     - 8+ sets: 52 VP

5. **Scarabs**:
   - Reveal all collected Scarab tiles.
   - Score VP shown on back.

**Total all VP**. Highest score wins.

#### Tiebreaker:
- If tied, player with **higher-value sarcophagus** wins.
- If neither has a sarcophagus, **shared victory**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move backward onto a Tunnel or Osiris tile?**  
  No. Movement is always **toward the Tomb Chamber** unless card says +/–1.

- **Can I use a Horus card to move backward?**  
  Only if the card allows (e.g., +/–1 card). Horus cards assume forward movement unless otherwise stated.

- **What happens if I can’t move with either end card?**  
  Discard one end card (left or right), skip action, then draw a card (unless you took a Horus card earlier).

- **Can I take a Horus card and then draw?**  
  No. Taking a Horus card (from Horus Tile or Favor of Horus) **replaces** the draw step.

- **Do I perform an action after Osiris movement?**  
  Yes — after final movement from Osiris tile, perform action of final tile.

- **Can multiple adventurers occupy the same tile?**  
  Yes.

- **Can I enter Tomb Chamber without a key?**  
  No. Must discard 1 key per adventurer entering.

- **Must movement be exact to enter Tomb Chamber?**  
  Yes. Cannot overshoot.

- **What if Horus stacks are empty?**  
  Cannot take a card from that stack. No replacement.
