## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
The goal of *Railroad Ink™* is to build efficient transportation networks by drawing routes on a personal board over 7 rounds (or fewer with expansions). Players score points primarily by connecting Exits via interconnected Routes (Highways and Railways), forming large Networks. Bonus points are earned for Longest Highway, Longest Railway, and using Central Spaces. The player with the highest total score wins; ties are broken by fewest Errors, then shared victory.

2. **Components**  
- 6 Markers (1 per player)  
- 4 Route Dice  
  - 3 dice: Straight Highway, Straight Railway, Curved Highway, Curved Railway, T-junction Highway, T-junction Railway  
  - 1 die: Overpass, Straight Station, Curved Station  
- 2 Lava Dice (Expansion)  
- 2 Meteor Dice (Expansion)  
- Player Boards (with Exits, Central Spaces, Scoring Table, Special Routes)  

3. **Setup**  
1. Each player takes one board and a marker.  
2. Place the 4 Route dice in the center.  
3. (Expansions only): Place Lava or Meteor dice if playing with those expansions.  
4. Players prepare their Scoring Table for tracking points and Errors.  

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
- Play proceeds over **7 rounds** (6 for Lava/Meteor expansions).  
- Each round:  
  1. Roll all active dice (Route + Expansion dice if applicable).  
  2. All players simultaneously draw the required Routes from the Route dice.  
  3. Apply expansion-specific rules (if any).  
  4. Mark drawn spaces with the round number.  
  5. Advance to next round.  
- After final round: Scoring phase begins.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Drawing Routes**:  
  - Must connect each new Route to an Exit or existing Route (unless using Special Route or expansion rule).  
  - All 4 dice results must be drawn if possible.  
  - Routes can be rotated or mirrored.  
  - Highways and Railways cannot directly connect; Stations are required.  
  - Overpasses allow crossing without connection.  

- **Special Routes**:  
  - Each player has 6 unique Special Routes on their board.  
  - Can use **1 per round**, up to **3 per game**.  
  - Once used, mark it off—cannot reuse.  
  - Enables creative connections beyond dice results.

- **Expansions (Optional)**:  
  - **Lava Expansion**:  
    - Game lasts 6 rounds.  
    - Each round, draw at least 1 Lava die result connected to existing Lava.  
    - Start with a Volcano in the Central Space.  
    - Open Lava sides count as Errors.  
    - Score: 5 pts per closed Lava lake, 1 pt per space in Largest Lava lake.  

  - **Meteor Expansion**:  
    - Game lasts 6 rounds.  
    - Meteor moves based on direction + distance dice from last impact (start at center).  
    - Draw Crater where Meteor hits; erase any Route there.  
    - Mark hit space with dot (erase previous).  
    - Can erase Crater later to draw a Route.  
    - Can spend a Special Route to ignore Meteor this round.  
    - Score: 2 pts per Route end connected to a Crater (not counted as Errors).

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
After Round 7 (or 6 for expansions):  
- **Networks**:  
  - Group connected Exits into Networks.  
  - Use Network Values track:  
    - 2 Exits = 1 pt, 3 = 3 pts, 4 = 6 pts, 5 = 10 pts, 6 = 15 pts, 7+ = 21 pts  
  - Stations connect Highways and Railways within a Network.  
  - Overpasses do **not** create connections.  

- **Bonus Points**:  
  - **Longest Highway**: Longest continuous Highway path (no branches/loops). 1 pt per space.  
  - **Longest Railway**: Same as Highway, for Railways.  
  - **Central Spaces**: 1 pt per Route segment drawn in the 9-center-space area.  

- **Errors**:  
  - Each open Route end not connected to another Route or board edge = 1 Error (mark with $\boxtimes$).  
  - Lose 1 point per Error.  
  - Exceptions: Crater-connected ends, Lava, Trail, Canyon, etc., depending on expansion.  

- **Final Score**:  
  - Sum all Network, Bonus, and Expansion points.  
  - Subtract Error penalties.  
  - Highest score wins. Tiebreak: fewest Errors → shared win.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can I skip drawing a die result?**  
  No, if it’s possible to legally draw it. Only skip if no valid placement exists.  
- **Can I use multiple Special Routes in one round?**  
  No. Max 1 per round, up to 3 per game.  
- **Do Stations count toward Highway/Railway length?**  
  Yes. Stations do not interrupt Longest Highway or Railway.  
- **Can I connect Highway to Railway without a Station?**  
  No. Only Stations allow cross-type connection.  
- **What happens if Meteor targets a filled space?**  
  Continue moving in same direction until finding empty space. Bounce off edges if needed.  
- **Can I rotate Special Routes?**  
  Yes, unless specified otherwise (standard assumption from core rules).  
- **Tie in Longest Route?**  
  Only one counts (e.g., two 8-length Highways → score 8 once).
