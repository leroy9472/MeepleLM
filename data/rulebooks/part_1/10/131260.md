## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Qwixx is a fast-paced dice-rolling game where players aim to mark as many numbers as possible in colored rows on their scoresheet to maximize their score. The goal is to strategically lock rows for bonus points while minimizing penalty points from failed actions.

This document covers the **Palette Variant** and the **Black Die Variant**, which can be played separately or combined.

---

### 2. Components  
- 2 white dice  
- 1 red die, 1 yellow die, 1 blue die (primary colors)  
- 1 black die (optional, for Black Die variant)  
- Scorecards with color rows (red, yellow, blue, orange, green, purple, and optional black row)  
- Pencils/pens for marking

Note: Green die is removed in the Palette Variant.

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player receives a scorecard.  
2. For the **Palette Variant**: Remove the green die from play. Use scorecards showing six color rows (red, yellow, blue, orange, green, purple) and optionally the black row.  
3. For the **Black Die Variant**: Add the black die to the dice pool.  
4. Decide turn order. Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On each turn, the active player follows these steps:

#### Step 1: Roll and Announce  
- Roll both white dice and all **unlocked** color dice (i.e., dice whose rows are not yet locked).  
- Announce the **sum of the two white dice** to all players.

#### Step 2: Optional White Dice Action (All Players)  
- Any player (including the active player) may mark **one number** in **any unlocked color row** that matches the sum of the two white dice.  
- Must follow left-to-right progression: you can only mark a number if all unmarked numbers to its left are already marked or skipped (and crossed out).  
- You cannot mark a number in a row if you have already skipped it in a previous turn.

#### Step 3: Optional Color Dice Action (Active Player Only)  
- The active player may choose **one** of the following:
  - Add **one white die** and **one color die** (of an unlocked row) and mark the result in the corresponding color row.
  - Combine **two primary color dice** to form a secondary color:
    - Red + Yellow = Orange
    - Yellow + Blue = Green
    - Red + Blue = Purple
  - (Black Die Variant only): Subtract **one white die** from the **black die** and mark the result in the **black row** (result must be 1–5).
- Numbers in the black row must be marked **left to right**; skipped numbers cannot be marked later.
- The active player must perform **at least one** of Step 2 or Step 3, or mark a "Mistake" (Pass) box.

#### Step 4: Locking a Row  
- A row is locked when a player marks the **last number** (the lock symbol).  
- Requirement: At least **5 of the first 10 numbers** in the row must be marked before locking.  
- Once locked:
  - The row is closed to **all players**.
  - The corresponding die is **removed** (for primary colors in standard rules), **but in the Palette Variant**, primary dice are **not removed** and can still be used to form secondary colors.
  - Secondary color rows (orange, green, purple) do not have an associated die, so no die is removed.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Left-to-right rule**: Numbers must be marked from left to right. You may skip numbers, but skipped numbers must be crossed out and can never be marked later.
- **Locking**: Only the active player can lock a row in Step 3. In Step 2, multiple players can lock a row simultaneously if they all mark the final number using the white dice sum.
- **Palette Variant Specifics**:
  - No green die is used.
  - Secondary color rows (orange, green, purple) are scored using combinations of two primary dice.
  - Primary dice remain in play even after their row is locked, to allow creation of secondary colors.
- **Black Die Variant Specifics**:
  - Add a black die.
  - Active player may use black die minus one white die to mark a number in the black row (values 1–5 only).
  - Black row is marked **left to right**, cannot skip and come back.
  - Black row does **not count** as a locked row for end-game triggering.
  - Scoring: Start with a base of **32 points**; subtract **1 point for each unmarked box** in the black row at game end.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### End Game Conditions (Palette Variant)  
The game ends immediately when:
- **Three color rows** have been locked (by any players), OR  
- Any player marks their **4th Mistake (Pass) box**.

> Note: The black row does **not** count toward the three locked rows.

#### Scoring  
- For each color row: count the number of marked boxes (including the lock if marked).
- Use the scoring table:
  - 1 mark = 1 point
  - 2 marks = 3 points
  - 3 marks = 6 points
  - 4 marks = 10 points
  - 5 marks = 15 points
  - 6 marks = 21 points
  - 7 marks = 28 points
  - 8 marks = 36 points
  - 9 marks = 45 points
  - 10 marks = 55 points
  - 11 marks = 66 points
  - 12 marks = 78 points
- **Black Row**: Start with **32 points**, subtract **1 point for each unmarked box** (i.e., each number not crossed off).
- **Penalties**: Subtract **5 points** for each Mistake (Pass) box marked.
- **Total Score**: Sum all row scores + black row score – penalty points.
- **Winner**: Highest total score wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use two white dice to mark the black row?**  
  No. Only black die minus one white die can be used.

- **Can I lock a row in Step 2 if others lock it too?**  
  Yes. Multiple players can lock the same row in Step 2 if they all mark the final number using the white dice sum.

- **Can I use a locked primary die to make a secondary color?**  
  Yes, in the **Palette Variant**, primary dice are **not removed** when their row is locked and can still be used to form secondary colors.

- **Can I mark a secondary color row using white dice?**  
  Yes, any player can mark a number in **any unlocked** row (including secondary colors) using the **sum of the two white dice** in Step 2.

- **Can I mark the black row out of order?**  
  No. Must mark from left to right. Skipped numbers cannot be marked later.

- **Does locking a secondary color row remove dice?**  
  No. There is no die associated with secondary color rows.

- **Can I mark a number in a color row using two white dice even after the color die is removed?**  
  Yes. Once a row is unlocked, players may continue to mark using the white dice sum, even if the color die is no longer in play.
