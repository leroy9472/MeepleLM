   - If **tan background (immediate)**: resolve effect now (players decide in clockwise order if choice involved).

2. **Orient the Event Card**  
   - Active player places card on city council space.  
   - May rotate card in 4 directions.  
   - Determines:  
     - Personal income for each player (symbol pointing to their direction)  
     - Number (0–3) the red arrow points to → spaces to move favor marker  

3. **Receive Personal Income**

   - If resource unavailable in supply, receive 1 VP instead.  
   - Place behind player screen (except VPs).  

4. **Award Favor**  
   - Move favor marker the number of spaces indicated by red arrow.  
   - Active player receives reward from space landed on.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Building Projects  
- Projects: Bridge (always present), Tower (added after Chapter II), others via event cards.  
- Use **Building Project** action to place your stone/wood on free spaces (grey=stone, brown=wood).  
- Receive 3 VP per resource placed.  
- Spaces may be filled in any order.  
- At end of each chapter, add 1 matching resource to each project (stone first if both spaces free).  

#### Donations  
- Use **Donation** to support a project.  
- Only one donation per player per project.  
- When project completes:  
  - Each donor receives bonus (VP + benefit)  
  - If benefit supply insufficient → all donors get nothing  
  - Donors retrieve donation seals  
- Hospital donors may immediately care for one plague victim (if have medical knowledge)  

#### Plague (Chapters III–IV)  
- After Chapter II: shuffle 11 plague markers, place face-down on 11 locations (10 houses, 1 outlaw).  
- Each round: drawn event card number (1–11) reveals infected location. Flip marker.  
- Number = medical knowledge required to care for them.  
- Use **Medicine** action: show sufficient medical knowledge → care for 1 or more locations (sum of requirements ≤ your knowledge)  
- Receive 2 VP + location-specific benefit per cared location  
- Outlaws (11): only 2 VP, no extra benefit  
- Cured locations are removed; no re-infection  

#### The Tower  
- 8 regular spaces (6 stone, 2 wood). Light blue top space filled when complete.  
- When 8 spaces filled:  
  - Player with most loyalty places metal resource and gets 3 VP  
  - Tie: each tied player gets 1 VP  
- Some event cards complete Tower immediately → fill remaining spaces from supply → award as above  
- If not completed by game end → no one gets metal or VP  

#### 2-Player Variant (WWE 2 Player.md)  
- **Setup Adjustments:**  
  - Grain pool: 5 (instead of 10)  
  - Piety pool: 6 (instead of 12)  
  - Loyalty pool: 7 (instead of 14)  
- **Buildings / End of Chapter:**  
  - Add 1 resource as normal  
  - Add **1 extra resource** to **2 buildings** with most open spaces  
  - Tie: favor building with most total spaces  
  - Still tied: favor building that has been out longest  
- **Houses:**  
  - Only **one house per resource type** across both players  
  - Example: if Player A builds Grain house, Player B cannot build second Grain house  
- **Favours2 (Favors in Rounds 3 & 4):**  
  - Only events 1, 2, 5, 6 in each chapter grant favor (i.e., first and last two)  
  - In **rounds 3 and 4**:  
    - Do **not** move favor marker  
    - Both players take only personal income  
    - No favor awarded  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after Chapter IV.  
- After paying mandatory duties:  
  - **Stone & Wood**: 1 VP each  
  - **Gold**: 1 VP per 2 gold (½ VP per gold)  
  - Other resources: no value  
- **Total VP = track + remaining resources + all bonuses**  
- **Tiebreakers (in order):**  
  1. Most Piety  
  2. Most Loyalty  
  3. Most Medical Knowledge  

#### Mandatory Duties (End of Each Chapter)  
- Pay:  
  - 2 Piety (lose 3 VP per missing)  
  - 2 Grain (lose 2 VP per missing)  
  - Gold = roll tax die (2–5) → lose 1 VP per missing gold  
- Penalties (next chapter):  
  - **Penance** (low piety): another player randomly discards 1 of your cards  
  - **Begging** (low grain): lose personal income in round 1  
  - **Royal Court** (low gold): play only 5 actions (still play/discard 1 card, no action)  
- **Protection**: Pay 1 Loyalty → avoid one penalty (still lose VP)  
- **Chapter IV Exception**:  
  - No penalties (no penance/begging/royal court)  
  - VP losses **doubled** for shortages  
  - Loyalty can still protect against **double** losses (but base loss still applies)  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build two houses with same income?**  
  No. You cannot build any house that duplicates an income type you already have.  
- **What if I can’t pay Outlaws favor?**  
  You cannot orient the card to point to Outlaws if you lack 1 gold.

- **What if I play Privilege but can’t repeat action?**  
  Nothing happens. Actions are voluntary.  
- **Do I pay medical knowledge when curing plague?**  
  No. You show it, but do not lose it.  
- **Can I rebuild on a space where a house was removed?**  
  Yes, if event allows removal (e.g., "In Kingsbridge..." event).  
- **Can I use loyalty to protect against multiple penalties?**  
  Yes, pay 1 loyalty per penalty.  
- **What if a donation bonus is unavailable?**
