### 1. Lore & Objective
Guards of Atlantis II is a team-based tactical board game where two teams compete across a modular battlefield. The primary objective is to defeat the opposing team by either pushing the battle zone into their throne zone, winning the final lane push, or depleting their life counters by defeating enemy heroes. Heroes grow stronger over time, and strategic coordination, positioning, and card play determine victory.

### 2. Components
- Game board with 7 zones (including throne and battle zones)
- Hero miniatures with colored bases
- Hero dashboards and level indicators
- 18 Action cards per hero (including Gold, Silver, Red, Blue, Green)
- Tie Breaker coin
- Wave counters (5 standard, 7 per lane in 8–10 player games)
- Life counters (6–8 depending on player count)
- Coins (currency for upgrades)
- Minion miniatures (Melee, Ranged, Heavy)
- Hero-specific tokens (e.g., Poison Marker, Turret, Zombies, Trees, Spells, etc.)
- Markers for active effects

### 3. Setup
1. Place the board and assign teams (Red and Blue).
2. Flip the Tie Breaker coin and place it near the board.
3. Place Wave and Life counters nearby (5 Wave, 6–8 Lives depending on player count).
4. Each player selects a hero and receives:
   - Miniature with colored base
   - Dashboard and level indicator (set to Level 1)
   - 18-card deck
   - Hero-specific tokens (if any)
5. Form starting hands: 3 Tier I cards + 2 basic (Gold/Silver) cards.
6. Place heroes on their team’s throne zone spawn points.
7. Place minions on spawn points in the central battle zone.
8. For 8–10 players: use double-lane map with separate battle zones and push tracking.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of 4 turns:
1. **Play One Card**: All players simultaneously choose and place a card facedown.
2. **Reveal & Resolve by Initiative**: Cards are revealed and resolved in descending initiative order.
   - Initiative ties: team on Tie Breaker resolves first, then coin flips.
   - Same-team ties: resolve in any order (no flip).
3. **Perform One Action**: Choose primary or secondary action (Move, Attack, Skill, Defense, Hold, Fast Travel, Clear).
4. **Card Resolution**: After action, place card face-up on dashboard.
5. **Turn Ends**: Repeat until all cards resolved.

After 4 turns:
1. **Minion Battle**: Team with fewer minions loses difference in minions (Heavy last).
2. **Push the Lane**: If one team has no minions, push battle zone toward their throne:
   - Remove all minions, respawn in next zone toward losing team’s throne.
   - Flip a Wave counter; if last one, the pushing team wins.
3. **Remove Tokens & Markers**: Clear all tokens and return markers.
4. **Retrieve Cards**: All players take back resolved and discarded cards.
5. **Level Up (Mandatory)**:
   - Spend coins equal to current level to level up.
   - Upgrade lowest-tier non-basic card: pick one of two same-color Tier+1 cards; the other becomes a hidden item under dashboard.
   - Cannot upgrade Tier III → IV until all Tier II are Tier III.
   - Unlock Ultimate at Level 8: gain a permanent passive ability.
   - If cannot afford level up, take 1 "pity coin" (no level gain).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Card Actions**:
  - **Attack**: Target adjacent (non-ranged) or within range. Minions die instantly. Heroes defend by discarding a card with Defense ≥ Attack Total.
  - **Movement**: Move up to boot value. Cannot move through obstacles (heroes, minions, terrain, tokens).
  - **Skill**: Apply card text as primary action.
  - **Defense**: Discard a card from hand to block an attack (only in response).
  - **Hold**: Do nothing.
  - **Fast Travel**: Replace Movement action. Move to any space in current or adjacent zone if no enemy units present in either.
  - **Clear Tokens**: Replace Attack action. Remove any adjacent tokens.
- **Attack Total**:
  - Card Attack + Attack Items + Minion Bonuses (adjacent melee/heavy +1, ranged within 2 +1) – Defender’s adjacent melee/heavy minions (–1 each).
- **Defense Total**:
  - Card Defense + Defense Items + Minion Bonuses (adjacent melee/heavy +1, enemy melee/heavy adjacent –1, enemy ranged within 2 –1).
- **Defeating a Hero**:
  - Remove from board; they respawn next turn before card resolution.
  - Attacker gains coins = hero’s level.
  - Attacker’s team gains assist coins = hero’s lowest card tier.
  - Defender’s team loses lives = hero’s lowest card tier.
- **Minions**:
  - Defeated (not removed) to gain coins: Melee/Ranged = 2, Heavy = 4.
  - Immune: Heavy cannot be targeted until all other friendly minions are gone.
  - Bonuses: Adjacent melee/heavy give +1 defense to friendly heroes, –1 to enemy.
  - Ranged minions within 2 spaces give –1 defense to enemy heroes.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends when:
- A team wins the **Last Push** (final Wave counter flipped).
- A team’s **battle zone reaches the enemy throne zone** during a push.
- A team **loses all life counters** from hero defeats.

Victory conditions:
- Pushing the lane into enemy throne wins immediately.
- Winning the final lane push wins the game.
- Depleting enemy lives wins the game.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Fast Travel**: Can only replace Movement action; cannot use during attack/skill movement. Zones must be empty of enemy units.
- **Clear Tokens**: Replaces Attack; removes any adjacent tokens; no card text applied.
- **Hero Respawn**: On your turn, before action, respawn on any empty throne spawn point.
- **Ties**: Between teams, use Tie Breaker coin. Same team: choose order.
- **Active Effects**: "This Turn", "Next Turn", "This Round" effects are canceled at end of round or when hero is defeated.
- **Obstacles**: Block movement, not line of sight or ranged attacks.
- **Upgrade Rules**: Must upgrade if possible. Must upgrade lowest tier first. Only non-basic cards can be upgraded.
- **Ultimate**: Gained at Level 8. Always active while hero is on board.
- **Discard Rules**: Defense requires discarding from hand. Cards with "discard a card" text follow same rule.
