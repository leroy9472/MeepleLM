## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Jambo is a competitive card game set in an African trading market. Players act as merchants buying and selling wares to earn gold. The objective is to be the first to reach a target amount of gold—50 gold in the solo variant, or 60 gold in the standard two-player game—triggering an endgame sequence.

### 2. Components  
- 110-card deck (40 wares, 70 non-wares: animals, people, utilities)  
- Two large market stands (6 spaces each)  
- Gold coins  
- Optional: Small market stands, huts (ritual, trading, store, spirit guard), relics (expansion modules)

### 3. Setup  
- Each player receives:  
  - One large market stand  
  - 20 gold coins  
  - 5 cards dealt from shuffled deck  
- Place remaining deck face-down as draw pile  
- In solo play:  
  - Assign one large market stand to Dummy player  
  - Give Dummy 20 gold  
  - Draw 1 Ware at random and set aside — this is the **Default Ware Type** for the game  
- You take the first turn

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows this structure:

#### A. Draw Phase (Optional)  
- Spend 1 AP to draw a card  
- You may keep it, ending the phase  
- Or discard it and repeat (only the last drawn card may be kept)

#### B. Play Phase (Optional)  
You may perform any number of actions using Action Points (APs), up to 5 per turn. Each action costs 1 AP.

Available Actions:
1. **Play Market Card**  
   - Build a small market stand (first costs 6 gold; all subsequent cost 3 gold)  
2. **Play Ware Card**  
   - Buy or sell wares listed on card  
   - Buy: pay left gold value per ware  
   - Sell: receive right gold value per ware  
   - Filling the 6th (2-cost) spot on large stand costs 2 gold  
   - After resolving, discard the card  
3. **Play Utility Card**  
   - Place face-up in play area (max 3 active)  
   - Does not activate when played  
   - If playing a 4th, discard one existing utility  
4. **Play Animal or People Card**  
   - Discard after resolving effect  
   - Some cards (e.g., Guard) can be played out of turn to block effects  
5. **Activate Utility Card**  
   - Tap card to activate effect  
   - Can activate even if played this turn  
   - Only once per turn per card  

#### C. Turn End  
- If 2 or more AP remain unspent, gain 1 gold  
- Untap all tapped utility cards

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Market Stand Rules  
- Fill wares from **top-left to bottom-right**  
- The 6th spot (bottom-right) on large stand costs 2 gold to fill  
- When a ware is removed, shift remaining wares **up** (toward top-left), skipping the 6th spot if desired  
- Maximum 3 utility cards in play  

#### Special Rules for Huts (Expansion)  
- **Ritual Hut**: Pay 3 AP → Draw top 3 cards, keep 1, discard 2 in any order  
- **Trading Hut**: Pay 2 AP → Move 2 wares from your market to supply, take 1 ware of choice into your market  
- **Store Hut**: Pay 1 AP → Move 1 ware between store and market  
  - Matching ware types on a ware card gain +1 gold when sold or -1 gold when bought  
  - Ware in store is protected (cannot be taken or sold)  
- **Spirit Guard Hut**: No cost → After draw phase, move 1 ware to spirit guard hut (only if empty)  

#### Solo Mode: Dummy Player Rules  
- Controlled by you using defined AI logic  
- Has own hand, market, and gold  
- Hand managed as a stack: draw face-down, play from top  
- During Dummy’s turn, resolve all cards in hand in order  

**Dummy Behavior Summary**:  
- **3/6-Ware Cards**:  
  - If has 2 (or 4 for 6-ware) matching wares, sell them for full price  
  - Else, if space and gold, buy all wares  
  - Else, discard all market wares for 1 gold each, then place new wares at no cost  
  - If supply insufficient, discard card  
- **Small Market**: Buy only if can afford (costs 6 first, then 3)  
- **Animals/People/Utilities**: Follow specific AI rules (see below)  

**Key Dummy Card Behaviors**:  
- **Arabian Merchant**: Bids 2 gold; you may pay 3 to steal cards. If Dummy <2 gold, you may take for 1 or discard  
- **Travelling Merchant**: Bids 3 gold; you must pay 4 to steal. If <3 gold, bids all, you must pay 1 more to take  
- **Cheetah**: Always gives you 2 gold if able; else you draw 2 cards  
- **Lion**: Uses Utility cards from Dummy’s hand + one from discard pile; you choose distribution of cards  
- **Tribal Elder**: Always makes you discard down to 3 cards. If already ≤3, Dummy draws up to 5 cards to play immediately  
- **Drummer / Kettle / Scale / Well**: Add cards to Dummy’s hand to be played immediately  
- **Mask of Transform**: Set aside; at start of next turn, add top discard to bottom of Dummy’s hand  
- **Psychic**: Discard all cards in Dummy’s hand, gain 2 gold per card  
- **Portuguese**: Discard all wares, gain 2 gold per ware  
- **Parrot / Throne**: Transfer wares between players  
- **Shaman**: Trade top-type wares for bottom-type wares; if impossible, gain 1 gold  
- **Leopard Statue / Basket Maker**: Buy ware matching bottom-most market ware (or Default Ware Type)  
- **Dancer**: Discard top 1–3 wares, gain 4 gold each  
- **Drums**: Discard top ware, draw and play 1 card immediately  
- **Weapons / Hyena / Guard / Crocodile**: Discard cards from your hand  
- **Rain Maker / Snake**: Affect your hand or utilities  
- **Wise Man / Leopard Statue**: Give Dummy gold or wares  

#### General Rules  
- Gold is public information  
- No hand limit  
- When gaining multiple wares (e.g., Carrier), leave extras in supply if no space  
- All small market stands cost 3 gold if any hut is in play  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Standard Game**: First player to **60 gold** at end of turn triggers endgame  
  - Opponent takes one final turn  
  - If opponent reaches **at least 60 gold**, they win  
  - Otherwise, triggering player wins  
- **Solo Variant**: First to **50 gold** wins  
  - Compare performance: higher your score when you win, or lower Dummy’s score when you lose, the better  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I activate a utility card the same turn I play it?**  
  A: Yes. Activation is allowed even on the turn of play.  

- **Q: What happens if I can’t fully resolve a card (e.g., no space for wares)?**  
  A: Do as much as possible. For example, Carrier gives up to 2 wares; leave extras in supply.  

- **Q: Can I play a Guard card during my own turn?**  
  A: Yes, but only to block an Animal card played by opponent during their turn. Guards are typically played out of turn.  

- **Q: How are ties resolved?**  
  A: In standard game, if both reach 60+ and are tied, the opponent wins by finishing last with equal or higher amount.  

- **Q: In solo mode, who resolves Dummy’s cards?**  
  A: You do, following the prescribed AI logic. You make choices only when specified (e.g., which cards to give).  

- **Q: What if Dummy draws a card that requires a choice (e.g., Lion)?**  
  A: You make the choice, but follow the rule: start with Dummy when distributing cards.  

- **Q: Can I use huts and relics together?**  
  A: Yes. Modules are independent and can be combined.  

- **Q: What happens to the Default Ware Type if Dummy’s market is empty?**  
  A: It is used as a fallback for cards that require a ware type (e.g., Carrier, Leopard Statue).
