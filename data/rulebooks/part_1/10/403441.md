### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Windmill Valley*, players take on the role of Dutch tulip farmers in the late 19th century Netherlands. You manage a farm, build windmills to dry the polders, plant colorful tulips, and enhance your operations through tools, market actions, and contracts. The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the game through strategic planting, windmill placement, fulfilling contracts, and achieving special conditions.

The game ends when any player reaches the final space on the Calendar track. After that, all players complete one full round, followed by one additional turn each, then proceed to final scoring.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn, perform these steps in order:

#### Step 1: Adjust Floodgate
Choose one:
- **No Change**: Floodgate stays.
- **Close Floodgate**: Move marker down any number of levels (free, no VP).
- **Open Floodgate**: Move up 1 or 2 levels (or from 1 to 3 in one move):
  - 1→2: Pay 1 Guilder, gain 1 VP
  - 2→3: Pay 2 Guilder, gain 3 VP
  - 1→3: Pay 3 Guilder, gain 4 VP  
  → You cannot both open and close in one turn.

**Restriction**: If Water Level is at 8, you **must** close Floodgate to level 1.

#### Step 2: Adjust Water Level
Based on Floodgate level:
- Level 1: No change
- Level 2: Move Water Level marker right 1 space
- Level 3: Move right 2 spaces  
→ Water Level cannot exceed 8.

#### Step 3: Rotate Wheels
- Rotate both wheels clockwise a number of steps equal to Floodgate level (1–3).
- You may spend **Tools** to change rotation:
  - 1 Tool = +1 or −1 step
  - Must rotate **at least 1**, maximum **4** steps total.

**Calendar Advance**: If the red spoke passes or aligns with the red arrow, move your marker one space forward on the Calendar. You may:
- Take the **common reward** (shown above the track)
- Choose **one unique reward** from the column (mark it with an "X" tile)

#### Step 4: Perform Action
Your Windmill board now shows two actions (one from each wheel). You may:
- Perform **one** of the two actions
- If either action has a **+** symbol, you may perform **both** (in any order)

Available actions:
- **Plant Tulip Bulbs**: Plant up to X bulbs (1, 2, or 3) from Storage into leftmost empty Patch in any row. If you cover a reward icon, gain it. Slide remaining bulbs left.
- **Build a Windmill**: Place a windmill on the Main board. Must:
  - Pay the cost (0–4 Guilder)
  - Be connected via path of windmills to the Market
  - Trace shortest path to Market; opponents gain 1 VP per their windmill on path
  - Gain all adjacent field rewards
- **Conduct Foreign Trade**:
  - Option A: Place 1 tulip (color not already on card) → gain two adjacent rewards. If 4 tulips now on card, return all to supply and place card under deck.
  - Option B: Take all tulips currently on the card into your Storage (return excess to supply)
- **Visit the Market**:
  - Pay the cost (1–3 Guilder)
  - Move your marker clockwise X spaces (1–3)
  - In each area you land, choose one reward and gain it once per marker in that area (max 3 times)
  - Once per turn, before moving, you may pay 1 Guilder to move a neutral marker to an area you will visit
  - If area is full, you may skip or pay 1 Guilder to another player to stack on their marker (gives access but doesn’t increase reward count)
- **Enhance the Wheels**:
  - Take 1 of the 4 available Wheel Enhancements:
    - Common (dark brown): Free
    - Uncommon (light brown): 1 Guilder
    - Unique (steel): 2 Guilder
  - Place on any action space on either wheel (replacing existing enhances)
  - Cannot install on spaces currently active
  - Before taking, may pay 1 Guilder to refresh all 4 tiles
  - Refill immediately after taking
- **Gain a Farm Enhancement**:
  - Take 1 of 3 available Farm Enhancement cards
  - Place as:
    - **Helper** (top of board): Gain ability (usable once per turn) + immediate VP (1, 3, or 6)
    - **Contract** (bottom of board): Scores at endgame
  - May pay 1 Guilder to refresh all cards
  - Refill immediately
  - If all Helper/Contract slots full, may replace a card (no VP bonus)
- **Lower the Water Level**:
  - Strength = action icon number (1, 2, or 3)
  - For each point of strength:
    - Water Level 6–8: Gain 2 Guilder **or** 2 VP
    - Water Level 3–5: Gain 1 Guilder **or** 1 VP
    - Water Level 0–2: Gain 1 Guilder
  - After gaining rewards, move Water Level marker left by strength amount (cannot go below 0)

#### Queen’s Wish
If at any time you meet the condition on the Queen’s Wish card, place your small marker on the highest uncovered space and immediately gain those VP. Cover with "X" tile.

#### Inability to Act
If you cannot perform **either** of your two actions, gain 2 Guilder and end your turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Tulip Storage**:
  - Holds up to 7 bulbs
  - Placing in 6th space: pay 1 Guilder
  - Placing in 7th space: pay 2 Guilder
  - If full or cannot pay, may **exchange** any bulb (no cost)
  - After using bulbs, slide remaining left

- **Wheel Enhancements**:
  - Modify actions on wheels
  - Some grant extra rewards or allow both actions
  - Replaceable; discarded tiles are returned to box

- **Farm Enhancements**:
  - **Helpers**: Immediate ability (once per turn), VP on placement
  - **Contracts**: Endgame scoring
  - Max 3 of each

- **Water System**:
  - Floodgate controls wheel rotation speed and Water Level rise
  - Water Level affects rewards from "Lower the Water Level" actions
  - Cannot exceed 8

- **Tools**:
  - Spend to adjust wheel rotation (±1 per Tool)
  - Max 4, min 1 rotation per turn

- **Guilder**:
  - Max 9; excess is lost
  - Cannot go below 0

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Trigger**: When any player reaches the final space of the Calendar track.

**End Sequence**:
1. Finish the current round (all players same number of turns)
2. Each player takes **one more turn**
3. Final scoring

**Final Scoring**:
1. **Contracts** (Farm board bottom):
   - Score each Contract card individually
2. **Empty Windmill Groups**:
   - For each group emptied, score:
     - White: 1 VP per white tulip planted
     - Yellow: 1 VP per yellow
     - Red: 2 VP per red
     - Violet: 2 VP per violet
     - Black: 3 VP per black
3. **Patches (Farm board)**:
   - **Rows**:
     - Complete row: score higher VP if all same color, else lower VP
   - **Columns**:
     - Complete column with 4 different colors: gain VP (top number)
     - Any column with duplicate colors (complete or not): lose VP (bottom number)

4. **Queen’s Wish**: Scored during game; no additional points
5. **Immediate Scoring Cards**: Already scored when triggered

**Tiebreakers**:
1. Most tulips planted (in Patches)
2. Most tulips in Storage
3. Most windmills on Main board
→ If still tied, players share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I perform actions in any order?** Yes, especially if using + actions or Helper abilities.
- **Can I use a Helper ability triggered by an action I just took?** Yes, even if the Helper was gained during the same turn.
- **What if a Wheel Enhancement type runs out?** Replace with a Common tile and cover cost with "X" tile.
- **Can I move a neutral marker just to block?** No — you must move it to an area you will visit during your Market action.
- **What if I can’t build a windmill due to connection?** You may still perform the action if you can pay and place (some enhancements allow disconnected builds).
- **Can I gain more than 9 Guilder?** No — excess is lost.
- **Do I have to take Calendar rewards?** No — optional, but advancing is mandatory.
- **Can I use a Helper ability more than once per turn?** No — once per turn, unless specified.
