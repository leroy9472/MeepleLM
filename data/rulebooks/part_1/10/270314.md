## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Cherry blossom season is upon the Zen gardens, and players compete to become the Master Gardener by cultivating the most harmonious and beautiful garden. Each player builds up to 3 garden columns (called "columns of cards") using cards featuring motifs: blue (water), green (vegetation), grey (stones), and pink (sakura trees). The goal is to strategically place cards to maximize points across three rounds, with final scoring rewarding all motifs and a special escalating scale for pink sakura cards.

### 2. Components  
- 120 Cards  
  - 34 blue motif cards  
  - 35 green motif cards  
  - 17 grey motif cards  
  - Pink motif cards make up the remainder (34 pink, inferred from total)  
- 1 Scorepad (per player or group)  
- Pen or pencil for scoring  

### 3. Setup  
- Shuffle the 120-card deck thoroughly.  
- Deal 10 cards face down to each player.  
- Place the remaining cards in a draw pile for later rounds.  
- Each player prepares a score sheet and writing tool.  
- Players may lay out space in front of them to build up to 3 vertical garden columns.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **3 rounds**. Each round follows this sequence:  

1. **Card Selection**:  
   - Each player selects **exactly 2 cards** from their hand and places them face down in front of them.  
   - The remaining cards in hand are passed to the adjacent player.  
     - Round 1: Pass clockwise  
     - Round 2: Pass counterclockwise  
     - Round 3: Pass clockwise  

2. **Card Placement**:  
   - After all players have passed, they reveal their selected 2 cards.  
   - Starting with the **last player to pass**, players take turns in **clockwise order** to place their selected cards.  
   - On a turn, a player may:  
     - Place both, one, or neither of the two selected cards into their gardens.  
     - Unused cards are placed face down on a discard pile.  

3. **Garden Building Rules**:  
   - Each player may have **up to 3 garden columns**.  
   - A new column can be started with any card.  
   - To add a card to an existing column:  
     - It must be **numerically lower than the current lowest card** in the column, or  
     - **Higher than the current highest card** in the column.  
     - Cards cannot be inserted in the middle.  
   - Columns are arranged vertically:  
     - Lower cards are placed **on top** of the column.  
     - Higher cards are placed **under** the column.  
     - This keeps numbers visible and maintains order.  

4. **Repeat**:  
   - Players draw 2 new cards from the passed hand and repeat selection and placement.  
   - This continues for **5 turns per round** (10 cards played per player).  
   - At the end of the round, all players’ hands are empty.  

5. **Scoring**:  
   - After **Round 1**: Score only **blue motif** cards — **3 points each**.  
   - After **Round 2**:  
     - Score **blue motif** cards — **3 points each** (again).  
     - Score **green motif** cards — **4 points each**.  
     - (Cumulative scoring: blue cards scored in both Rounds 1 and 2.)  
   - After scoring, deal **10 new cards** to each player from the draw pile.  
   - Gardens remain on the table — players continue building on them.  

6. **Round 3**:  
   - Same gameplay as previous rounds.  
   - No scoring until the **end of the round**.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Drafting**: Players select 2 cards per turn and pass the rest, enabling strategic control and interaction.  
- **Garden Construction**:  
  - Columns grow only outward (not inward).  
  - Players manage up to 3 independent sequences.  
  - Number order matters, but gaps are allowed.  
- **Motif-Based Scoring**:  
  - Blue: 3 points each (scored in all 3 rounds)  
  - Green: 4 points each (scored in Rounds 2 and 3)  
  - Grey: 7 points each (scored only in Round 3)  
  - Pink: Variable points based on total count (see scoring table)  
- **Cumulative Scoring**: Points are tallied after each round and added to the total.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After **Round 3**, final scoring:  
- **Blue cards**: 3 points each (third time)  
- **Green cards**: 4 points each (second time)  
- **Grey cards**: 7 points each (first and only time)  
- **Pink cards**: Scored once, based on total number laid:  

| Pink Cards | Points |
|------------|--------|
| 1          | 1      |
| 2          | 3      |
| 3          | 6      |
| 4          | 10     |
| 5          | 15     |
| 6          | 21     |
| 7          | 28     |
| 8          | 36     |
| 9          | 45     |
| 10         | 55     |
| 11         | 66     |
| 12         | 78     |

| 14         | 105    |
| 15         | 120    |

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I start a new column on any turn?**  
  Yes, as long as you have fewer than 3 columns.  

- **Can I skip placing a card even if it fits?**  
  Yes. Players may choose to discard any or both selected cards.  

- **Are blue cards scored every round?**  
  Yes — 3 points each after Round 1, again after Round 2, and again after Round 3.  

- **Do I lose my gardens between rounds?**  
  No. Gardens stay in play and are expanded in subsequent rounds.  

- **What if the draw pile runs out?**  
  The rules do not specify, but with 120 cards and 3 rounds of 10 cards per player, ensure enough cards are available based on player count. (Exact player count not specified, but typical play is 2–4 players.)  

- **Can I place both cards in different columns?**  
  Yes, as long as placement rules are followed.  

- **What happens to discarded cards?**  
  They go to a face-down discard pile. Not reused.
