### 1. Lore & Objective
Dice Hospital is a strategic game where each player manages their own hospital, receiving and treating patients represented by dice. The goal is to heal patients by increasing their die values through various hospital departments and specialists, discharging them when their value reaches 7 or higher. Players score points for discharged patients each round. At the end of 8 rounds, the player with the highest score—adjusted by subtracting points for fatalities and adding points for leftover blood bags—wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round has 6 phases:
1. **Patient Intake**
2. **Hospital Improvement**
3. **Hospital Activation**
4. **Neglected Patients**
5. **Discharged Patients**
6. **Shift Change**

After 8 rounds, proceed to End Game Scoring.

---

#### Phase 1: Patient Intake
- First Player draws 3 dice per ambulance (e.g., 12 dice in a 3-player game), rolls them, and re-rolls any 1s or 6s until all show 2–5.
- Dice are placed in ambulances from lowest to highest value, starting with lowest-numbered ambulance.
- For dice of same value across ambulances, the player to the right of First Player assigns placement.
- Players, starting with First Player (clockwise), choose one ambulance (First Player cannot take #1).
- The player who took the lowest-numbered ambulance gains a Blood bag token and the First Player token.
- Remaining ambulance dice return to the bag; the card stays for next round.
- Players place new patients into any empty untreated ward spaces (max 12 per player).
- If no space, remove existing patients (not new ones) as fatalities: return die to bag, take 1 Fatality token.

#### Phase 2: Hospital Improvement
- Players act in ambulance-number order.
- Each may take:
  - 1 face-up Department tile (attach to hospital board, adjacent to existing department), or
  - 1 face-up Specialist card (place near board, take matching-color meeple and place it on the card).
- Multiple copies of same improvement allowed.
- After all players act, each may return **one** improvement (new or old) to the bottom of its stack to gain 1 Blood bag token.

#### Phase 3: Hospital Activation
- Players activate hospitals individually (recommended for new players) or simultaneously.
- Place meeples (nurses or specialists) one at a time into unactivated departments to trigger effects.
- Each meeple and department can be used only once per round.
- When a patient is healed:
  - Increase die value by 1.
  - If first healing this round, move from untreated (top) to treated (bottom) ward space.
- Treated patients can be healed again.
- If healing raises value to 7+, patient is **discharged immediately**.
- **Specialist Effect**: After department effect, if conditions are met, trigger specialist’s ability (optional, once per activation).
- **Blood Bag Use**: At any time during activation, discard 1 token to:
  - Heal any patient 1 step, or
  - Temporarily change a die’s color for current effect resolution.
- Return healed die to treated space if first treatment.
- Place die in department of new color to track temporary change.
- Not all meeples must be used.

#### Phase 4: Neglected Patients
- All untreated patients (still in top ward row) decrease by 1.
- If a patient drops to 0, it becomes a fatality: die to bag, take 1 Fatality token.
- Some Administrator cards protect 1 neglected patient per color.

#### Phase 5: Discharged Patients
- Score points based on number of patients discharged this round:
  - 1: 1 pt, 2: 3 pts, 3: 5 pts, 4: 7 pts, 5: 9 pts, 6: 11 pts, 7: 14 pts, 8: 17 pts, 9: 21 pts, 10: 25 pts, 11: 30 pts, 12: 35 pts
- **Bonus**: If all 4 wards are empty, gain +5 points.
- All discharged patients return to the bag.

#### Phase 6: Shift Change
- All players:
  - Return nurses to Nurses' Station.
  - Return specialists to their cards.
  - Move treated patients back to untreated spaces.
  - Return ambulances to center.
- First Player:
  - Advance round marker.
  - Move unclaimed improvements to bottom of stacks (random order).
  - Reveal new (players − 1) Department tiles and Specialist cards.
  - In 2-player games: reveal one additional Department or Specialist.
