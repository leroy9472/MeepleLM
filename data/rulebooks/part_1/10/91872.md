# DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS BOARD GAME CAMPAIGN RULES

## 1. Lore & Objective
The campaign variant for *Legend of Drizzt* transforms the base game into a role-playing experience where heroes progress across adventures. The objective is to cooperatively complete each adventure's goals while developing your heroes through experience, gold, and blessings. The campaign links multiple adventures into a continuous narrative, allowing characters to grow in power and face increasingly difficult challenges.

## 2. Components
- Hero Sheets for tracking character progression
- Experience Points (XP) tokens
- Healing Surge tokens
- Treasure cards
- Monster, Encounter, and Treasure decks
- Gold (tracked separately)
- Blessed points (on Hero Sheets)
- Adventure Book with specific scenarios

## 3. Setup
- Choose an adventure from the Adventure Book.
- Shuffle Monster, Encounter, and Treasure decks separately.
- Each player selects a hero, taking the corresponding Hero card, Power cards, and figure.
- Set up cavern tiles, starting tile, and any quest tiles per adventure instructions.
- Start with 1 Healing Surge token shared by the party (unless specified otherwise).
- Set initial treasure cards per adventure setup.
- Determine first player.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Hero Phase**: Perform one action: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, or Two Moves. Use Utility powers or Hero Special Ability as desired.
2. **Exploration Phase**: If on an unexplored edge, draw and place a cavern tile with a monster.
3. **Villain Phase**: If no tile was placed or it had a black triangle, draw and resolve an Encounter card. Activate all monsters and traps controlled by players.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Refresh**: Heroes start each adventure fully healed with all powers available.
- **Healing Surges**: Recover all lost HP. Use HP value as Surge Value. Party starts with 1 Healing Surge per adventure.
- **Treasure Limits**: Each hero can hold 6 treasure cards maximum. Must discard down if exceeding limit.
- **Experience Points**: Earned from defeating monsters and villains. Villains provide XP equal to their level. Unspent XP converts to gold between adventures (1 XP = 1 gold).
- **Blessed Points**: Purchased for 10 gold between adventures. Can be used to:
  - Re-roll any dice roll
  - Cancel Encounter Cards (like XP)
  - Substitute for a healing surge
  - Turn a successful hit into a miss
- **Collecting Gold**: Each defeated monster/villain provides gold equal to its XP value to every party member.
- **Levelling Up**: Spend 5 XP during an adventure (on natural 20 attack roll) to level up. Flip hero card to increase HP, AC, Surge Value, choose new Daily Power, and gain critical attack ability. Only once per adventure.
- **Conditions**:
  - *Slowed*: Speed reduced by 2
  - *Dazed*: Can move OR attack, not both
  - *Immobilized*: Cannot move but can attack
  - *Paralyzed*: Take +1 damage, miss all attacks, skip turn
  - *Poisoned*: Take 1 damage at start of Hero Phase; end on 10+
  - *Stunned*: -4 to AC, miss turn
  - *Weakened*: -4 to attack rolls

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory**: Complete the adventure's objective.
- **Defeat**: Any hero starts their turn at 0 HP with no Healing Surges remaining and no Blessed points available.
- **Permanent Death**: Heroes reduced to 0 HP with no healing options are killed permanently and cannot participate in future adventures.
- **Adventure Progression**: After each adventure, increase difficulty tier. If won without using Healing Surges, increase by two tiers.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Multiple Monsters Same Type**: Activate each separately on your turn.
- **Monster Placement**: Place on mushroom patch; if occupied, place anywhere on tile.
- **Hero at 0 HP**: Figure is placed on its side. Cannot act but can be healed. Must use Healing Surge at start of turn if available.
- **Between Adventures**: 
  - Sell excess treasures (1 gold each)
  - Purchase new treasure cards (2 gold each)
  - Train in new power cards (cost increases with each training)
  - Seek blessings (10 gold each)
  - Convert unspent XP to gold
