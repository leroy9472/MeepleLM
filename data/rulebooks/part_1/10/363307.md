## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The game simulates ecological development across four Seasons on a shared planet. Players take on the role of forces shaping biomes, growing forests, and managing environmental balance. The objective is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) through seasonal scoring and end-game evaluation based on tree growth, sunlight exposure, forest connectivity, and biome fertility.

2. Components  
- Biome Cards (with symbols for Fertility, Aridity, or neutral)  
- Player Boards with Power Track  
- Sprouts, Small Trees, Big Trees (plant components)  
- Bush tokens  
- Lake tokens  
- First Player marker  
- Fertility Zone tracker  
- Sun marker for light direction  
- Game board representing the planet divided into Biomes  

3. Setup  
- Shuffle Biome Cards and place face-up in a row near the deck.  
- Each player receives a player board, plant components, and starts with an un-upgraded Power Track.  
- Determine starting player randomly; give them the First Player marker.  
- Set Sun marker to starting position (Spring).  
- Prepare Fertility Zone tracker (empty at start).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds over 4 Seasons: Spring (5 Rounds), Summer (4 Rounds), Autumn (3 Rounds), Winter (2 Rounds).  
Each Round has 3 Phases:

**Phase 1: Pick a Biome Card**  
a) Starting player selects one face-up Biome Card and places the First Player marker on the card closest to the deck (this determines next round’s starting player order).  
b) Remaining players pick one card each in clockwise order.  
c) The leftover card is added to the **Fertility Zone**:  
   - If the card has a **Fertility** symbol, add +1 to Fertility Zone total.  
   - If it has an **Aridity** symbol, subtract 1 (minimum 0).  
   - Neutral symbols have no effect.  
d) If the card with the First Player marker was not chosen, the original starting player retains the marker.  

**Phase 2: Perform an Action and Use Card Power (in any order)**  

**Available Actions** (first 3 only on Biome matching the picked card):  
- **Plant up to 3 Sprouts** in one matching Biome.  
- **Grow 2 different plants**:  
  - Sprout → Small Tree  
  - Small Tree → Big Tree  
- **Plant 1 Sprout and Grow 1 plant** (different from the planted sprout) in matching Biome.  
- **Plant 1 Sprout or Grow 1 plant anywhere** (any Biome, no match required).  

**Card Powers** (after upgrading Power Track):  
- **Small Tree Growth**: Grow Sprout → Small Tree  
- **Plant Sprout**: Plant 1 Sprout  
- **Big Tree Growth**: Grow Small Tree → Big Tree  
- **Gain Victory Points**: Earn VP as indicated on track  
- **Place Lake**: Place 1 Lake token in any Biome  
- **Plant Bush**: Add 1 Bush to any Biome  

> Before using the power, **upgrade your Power Track** by one level (unlocking stronger effects). Then use the upgraded power.

**Phase 3: End of Round**  
- Check if maximum Rounds for the current Season have been completed.  
- If so, trigger **End of Season Scoring**.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Biome Matching**: Most actions require player to have played a card matching the Biome where action occurs.  
- **Power Track**: A personal progression track that unlocks stronger card powers as it is upgraded each turn.  
- **Fertility Zone**: A global track modified by leftover cards; affects end-game scoring.  
- **Sunlight & Shadows**: At end of each Season, light direction determines which trees score.  
  - Small Trees cast a 1-space shadow in the direction away from the sun.  
  - Big Trees cast a 2-space shadow.  
  - Trees not in shadow gain VP; shadowed trees do not.  
- **Forest Formation**: Orthogonally adjacent Trees (Small/Big) and Bushes form a Forest.  
  - Only the **largest Forest** on a player’s side of the planet is scored each season.  
  - Score 1 VP per component (tree or bush) in that Forest.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
**End of Season Scoring (after Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter):**  
- **Light Scoring**:  
  - Adjust Sun position.  
  - Cast shadows from Big (2 spaces) and Small Trees (1 space).  
  - Trees hit by light score:  
    - Small Tree = 1 VP  
    - Big Tree = 2 VP  
  - Shadowed trees score nothing.  
- **Forest Scoring**:  
  - Identify all connected Forests (Trees and Bushes, orthogonal only).  
  - Score 1 VP per element in your **largest Forest**.  

**End Game Scoring (after Winter):**  
Score additional VP based on:  
- **Fertility Value** of Biome (equal to final Fertility Zone total)  
- Multiplied by the number of **Big Tree symbols** in the Biomes each player controls.  
> VP = (Fertility Zone total) × (number of Big Tree icons across all player-controlled Biomes)

Final score = Sum of all seasonal VP + End Game Scoring VP

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Tie in Forest Size**: If multiple Forests are tied for largest, player chooses which to score.  
- **Shadow Stacking**: Shadows can overlap; only the tip of the shadow matters. A tree beyond a shadow’s range but blocked by another shadow is still shadowed.  
- **Lake Placement**: Lakes block shadow projection. Shadows stop at Lake tiles.  
- **Power Track Max Level**: Track has a defined maximum (not specified here; see rulebook). Stop upgrading when maxed.  
- **Biome Control for End Game**: "Your Biomes" refers to areas where you have at least one plant (Sprout or larger).  
- **Aridity Effect**: Aridity reduces Fertility Zone by 1 when added; cannot go below 0.
