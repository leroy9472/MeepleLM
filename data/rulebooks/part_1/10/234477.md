The goal is to earn the most Honor by the end of the game through controlling territories, fulfilling secret objectives, and leveraging clan-specific strengths.

### 2. Components  
- Game board depicting provinces of Rokugan, including Shadowlands  
- Clan initiative cards  
- Neutral initiative cards

3. **Place Control Tokens**:

   - Set aside additional control tokens for initial placement.  
4. **Determine First Player**:  
   - Build an Initiative Deck using 1 clan initiative card per player.  
   - Add neutral initiative cards until the deck contains 4 cards total.  
   - The first card discarded from this deck determines the first player.  
5. **Initial Placement**:  
   - Starting with the first player, each player takes turns placing one of the set-aside control tokens, facedown, on any unoccupied province.  
   - Continue until all set-aside tokens are placed.  
6. **Prepare Game State**:  
   - Place the round tracker on the board (starting at Round 1).  
   - Each player draws combat tokens to a full hand (implied: up to 6, based on quick reference).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Clan Abilities  
Each clan has a unique ability:  
- **Unicorn Clan (Raid)**: May switch 2 of their tokens before combat reveal.  
- **Scorpion Clan (+Shinobi 3)**: Once per round, may look at 1 token on the board.  
- **Phoenix Clan (+Blessing 3)**: Ignore capital defenses when attacking.  
- **Lion Clan (+Army 6)**: Their Bluff token has +2 defense when placed to defend a province.  
- **Dragon Clan (+Blessing 3)**: Draws 1 additional combat token, then returns 1 non-Bluff token to the supply.  
- **Crane Clan (+Diplomacy)**: Wins ties during battle resolution.  
- **Crab Clan (+Navy 3)**: Faceup control token provides +2 bonus (context implies military or defense bonus in relevant provinces).  

#### Control Tokens  
- Placed **facedown** initially.  
- When a province is conquered, the winner places a **faceup** control token.  
- Shadowlands provinces do not grant honor for faceup tokens.  

#### Combat Tokens  
- Include types: Bluff, Army, Navy, Blessing, Raid, Diplomacy, Shinobi.  
- Most are placed **facedown**.  
- Bluff tokens are discarded after use.  
- Blessing tokens can be placed multiple per border (exception to placement rule).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
At the end of the final round, players earn Honor as follows:  
- **5 Honor** for each territory they control.  
- **Honor equal to the total number of flowers** in their controlled provinces (based on territory card values).  
- **Bonus Honor** from their **secret objective card**.  
- **No Honor** is awarded for:  
  - Shadowlands territories.  
  - Any faceup control tokens located in the Shadowlands.  

The player with the most Honor wins. Ties are broken by Crane Clan ability if applicable.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Tie Resolution**: Crane Clan wins all ties during battle resolution.  
- **Bluff Tokens**: Discarded after reveal; Lion’s Bluff grants +2 defense when defending.  
- **Unicorn Raid**: Token switching occurs **before** reveal, during Resolution Phase Step 3.  
- **Dragon Clan Draw**: Must draw 1 extra token, then return 1 non-Bluff token to supply.  
- **Scorpion Shinobi**: Ability usable **once per round**; player may look at **any one token** on the board.  
- **Phoenix Blessing**: Allows attacker to ignore capital province defensive bonuses.  
- **Crab Navy**: Faceup control token grants +2 (assumed to be combat strength or defense).  
- **Multiple Blessings**: May be placed on same border, unlike other token types.
