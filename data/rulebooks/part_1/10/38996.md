# Washington's War — Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
**Lore**:  
*Washington's War* is a two-player strategy board game simulating the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). One player controls the British forces, representing the Crown's attempt to suppress the rebellion. The other controls the American revolutionaries, striving for independence. The game emphasizes political control, military maneuver, and the shifting tides of public support.

**Objective**:  
The game ends when either:
- The "North's Government Falls—War Ends" card is played, or
- The game reaches 1783.

Victory is determined by **colony control**:
- **American Victory**: Controls **7 or more** of the 14 colonies (including Canada).
- **British Victory**: Controls **6 or more** colonies.
- If both or neither meet their threshold, **Britain wins by default**.

An **automatic victory** occurs if:
- No American/French CUs remain on the map (British win), or
- No British CUs remain in the 13 colonies (American win).

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Strategy Cards
- **Ops Cards (1, 2, 3 Ops)**:
  - **Play for Ops**: Perform one of:
    - Activate a General (must meet Strategy Rating).
    - Place Reinforcements.
    - Start/Play into Operations Queue.
    - Take PC Actions (number = Ops value).
  - **Exchange**: After opponent discards an Event, exchange an Ops card for it (American: 2/3 Ops only; British: any Ops).
- **Event Cards**:
  - **Play for Event**: Implement card text. Red-boxed = Battle Card (+2 DRM).
  - **Discard for Action**:
    - No action.
    - Take 1 PC action (adjacent to friendly PC).
    - Remove 1 enemy PC (adjacent to friendly PC, no enemy CU/General/CC).
- **Campaign Cards**:
  - **Minor**: Activate 2 Generals or 1 General + Landing Party.
  - **Major**: Activate 3 Generals or 2 Generals + Landing Party.
  - Generals activate one at a time; CUs cannot be moved by multiple Generals.
- **Special Event Cards**:
  - 7 cards marked "Must be Played".
  - Holder chooses when to play; if drawn from opponent, implement immediately.

### Movement
- **Standard Movement**:
  - Activated General moves up to 4 spaces with up to 5 CUs.
  - **American Mobility**: Move up to 5 spaces if no battle/overrun.
- **Wilderness Routes**:
  - Dotted lines count as 3 spaces.
  - Only Benedict Arnold may use Falmouth–Quebec route.
- **Naval Movement (British Only)**:
  - General + up to 5 CUs move from one eligible port to another.
  - **Eligible Ports**: Not blockaded, no American CU/PC, fortified ports require British PC.
- **Interception (American Only)**:
  - When British Army moves into a space with an American PC, American may intercept.
  - Roll ≤ General’s Agility to succeed.
  - Ends British movement; battle occurs.
- **Retreat Before Battle (American Only)**:
  - When British enters space, American may retreat.
  - Roll ≤ General’s Agility (Washington/Greene: +2).
  - Only 5 CUs may retreat.

### Combat
- **Attacker**: Activated Army is always attacker.
- **Battle Rating**:
  - Roll d6: 1–3 = half General’s rating (rounded down); 4–6 = full rating.
  - Cannot exceed number of CUs.
- **DRMs**:
  - **+X**: Number of CUs.
  - **+Y**: General’s Actual Battle Rating.
  - **British Regulars Advantage**: +1 (lost if 3+ CUs lost in battle or via event).
  - **Royal Navy Support**: +1 in port (not if blockaded; fortified port requires British PC).
  - **Militia Support**: +1 if most PCs in colony (Canada requires Montreal & Quebec).
  - **American Winter Offensive**: +2 if Washington attacks on last card of turn.
  - **Battle Card**: +2 if played.
  - **Discarded Event**: +1 (not Special).
  - **Interception Bonus**: +1 for Americans.
- **Combat Resolution**:
  1. Play/discard Battle Card or Event (+2/+1 DRM).
  2. Determine General’s Actual Battle Rating.
  3. Calculate Total DRM for each side.
  4. Roll d6 + DRM; attacker wins if ≥ defender.
  5. **Casualties**:
     - **Loser**: Roll d6: 1–3: -1 CU; 4–5: -2 CUs; 6: -3 CUs.
     - **Winner**: Roll d6; lose 1 CU if result ≤ losing General’s Agility.
  6. **Retreat**:
     - Attacker retreats to entry space.
     - Defender retreats to any adjacent legal space (not entry space).
     - **British Retreat by Sea**: From port, if not blockaded and fortified port has British PC.
  7. **Surrender**: If no legal retreat, CUs eliminated, General captured.
- **Overrun**: Activated Army (4–5 CUs) enters space with 1 enemy CU (no General). Remove CU; no roll for losses.

### Reinforcements

  - Twice per turn.
  - Play Ops card: bring in CUs = Ops value to any space without British CU/PC.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
**Victory Conditions**:
- **Automatic Victory**:
  - No American/French CUs → British win.
  - No British CUs in 13 colonies → American win.
- **Normal Victory** (at game end):
  - Count controlled colonies (14 total, including Canada).
  - Control = majority of PC markers in colony.
  - Canada: control both Montreal and Quebec.
  - **American**: Win if ≥7 colonies and Britain has <6.
  - **British**: Win if ≥6 colonies, or if both/neither meet thresholds.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Capturing Generals**: Army enters space with enemy General and 0 CUs → General captured. Washington captured → removed from game.
- **Overruns**: Occur before interception; moving Army removes CU and may continue.
- **Retreat by Sea**: Only from port; destination must be unblockaded, no American CU/PC.
- **Operations Queue**: Must continue until activated or abandoned; cannot span turns.
- **French Navy**: Affects all ports in Blockade Zone: no reinforcements, naval movement, landing parties, retreat by sea, or RN support.
- **Continental Congress Dispersed**:
  - American cannot use Ops cards or discarded Events to place/flip PCs.
  - Can still play Events to place PCs, use Ops to flip, or discard Events to remove.
- **Washington in Reinforcements**: Cannot be replaced via reinforcement if removed.
