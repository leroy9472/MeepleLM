## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Tribune: First Among Equals is a strategic board game set in ancient Rome, where players vie for power and influence by controlling parliamentary factions, earning divine favor, accumulating wealth, and gaining military and political prestige. The goal is to fulfill a specific number of victory conditions (determined by a randomly selected victory condition card at the start of the game). Alternatively, the game can be played in a point-scoring variant where the first player to control a certain number of factions triggers the endgame.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds, each with six phases:

#### Phase 1: Place Cards  
Cards are placed face-up or face-down on board areas based on location:
- I. Hot Springs: 1 face-up per space
- II. Forum Romanum: 1 face-up per space
- III. Latrine: 1 face-down
- IV. Curia: Face-up cards until total value ≥ 5 (unless a leader is placed)

**Important Event**: If the draw deck and discard pile are exhausted:
- Players with >7 cards discard down to 7.
- For any faction with ≥4 cards: discard 2 lowest.
- For any faction with 3 cards: discard 1.
- Factions with ≤2 cards: keep all.

#### Phase 2: Place Figures  
Players place figures clockwise, starting with the starting player. One figure per space.

**Options**:
- **City Areas (I–VII)**: Place figure to access area in Phase 3.
- **Parliamentary Groups**: Place on 1st or 2nd space to attempt takeover (cannot place on group you already control).
- **Coin Bowl**:
  - Large coin: +7 sesterces immediately.
  - Other spaces: +5 sesterces per figure.

**Exceptions**:
- **Atrium Auctionorum**:
  - First figure: turn 2 cards face-up.
  - Second figure: turn last card face-up.
  - One player cannot occupy both spaces.
- **Pantheon**:
  - Only players controlling Vestal Virgins may place a figure.
  - When placed, only that player may view the card.

#### Phase 3: Evaluate Areas  
Evaluate in order I–VIII. Players retrieve figures after evaluation. Empty areas discard cards.

- **I. Hot Springs**: Pay 1 sesterce per figure to take adjacent card.
- **II. Forum Romanum**: Pay 3 sesterces per figure to take adjacent card.
- **III. Latrine**: Reveal card; choose:
  - Take card value in sesterces and discard card.
  - Pay card value in sesterces to take the card.
  - Leader cards cost nothing.
- **IV. Curia**: Discard any card to take adjacent card.
- **V. Atrium Auctionorum**:
  - One figure: pay 1 sesterce to take both revealed cards; discard face-down.
  - Two figures: secret auction. High bidder takes all 3 cards, pays bid to other player. Tie: first player wins.
- **VI. Catacombs**:
  - 4-space: view 5 cards, pay 4 sesterces to buy one.
  - 3-space: same, pay 3.
  - 2-space: same, pay 2.
  - All paid sesterces go to Catacombs pool (not general supply).

  - Reveal card.
  - Discard a card of the same faction (any value) as sacrifice.
  - Success: gain Eternal Favor of the Gods marker.
- **VIII. Victory Column**:
  - Discard 2 cards of same faction to gain 1 laurel.
  - All players reveal pairs simultaneously.
  - Highest total value gains +1 laurel (tie: no extra; solo player: gets extra).

#### Phase 4: Parliamentary Group Control  
In fixed order (Gladiators → Senators), resolve takeovers.

To take control:
- Play ≥2 cards of the group.
- If contested (two players), second player acts first.

**Conditions to take control** (must meet **one**):

- Number of cards > opponent's played cards.

**Outcomes**:
- First controller: gains starting laurel.
- Gains faction marker (if not already owned).
- Gains **assumption benefit** (immediate reward).
- Cards played are discarded.

**Conflict Resolution**:
- Second player plays cards first.
- First player must beat second player's value or count.
- If first player wins: takes control; second player discards one card, returns rest.
- Second player may decline to challenge.

#### Phase 5: Use Parliamentary Group Abilities  
In same order (Gladiators → Senators), players controlling groups gain **control benefits**.

- **Gladiators**:
  - Take sesterces from Catacombs **or** draw 1 card.
  - May use assassin: remove highest card from opponent’s faction control set (not if ≤2 cards).
- **Legates**:
  - Gain Scroll marker (if not owned) **or** draw 1 card.
  - May pay sesterces = total value of all Legates cards in play to gain 1 legion.

- **Senators**:
  - Gain Scroll **or** draw 2 cards.

#### Phase 6: Auction of the Chariot  
- Players bid sesterces secretly.
- Highest bidder wins.
  - Places chariot on **one** of their controlled factions.
  - That faction is **blocked** next round: no figures, no control change.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I place a figure on a faction I already control?**  
A: No. You may only place on factions you do not control.

**Q: Can I control multiple factions in one round?**  
A: Yes, if you place figures on multiple uncontrolled factions.

**Q: What happens if I can’t pay for a card in Hot Springs/Forum?**  
A: You don’t get the card; figure is wasted.

**Q: Can I use the assassin more than once per round?**  
A: No. Each faction (Gladiators, Plebeians) allows one assassin use per control phase.

**Q: Can I bid 0 in the chariot auction?**  
A: Yes. But if all bid 0 or tie, chariot is set aside.

**Q: Can I place multiple figures in the same area?**  
A: Yes, except where restricted (e.g., Atrium Auctionorum: max one per player).

**Q: What if I lose Vestal Virgins—do I lose Temporary Favor?**  
A: Yes. Eternal Favor is retained.

**Q: Can I use the Proconsul figure in Phase 2?**  
A: Yes. It acts as an extra figure for the player who controls Patricians.
