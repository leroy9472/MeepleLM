### 3. Setup  
1. **Set Aside Mi-Go Braincase**: Place the Mi-Go Braincase card face up—it is not shuffled into the deck.
2. **Shuffle Deck**: Shuffle the remaining 24 cards to form a face-down draw deck.
3. **Remove One Card**: Remove the top card of the deck and set it aside face down (not used in the round).
4. **2-Player Game Only**: Reveal and set aside the next 5 cards face up (used for deduction).
5. **Deal Starting Cards**: Each player draws 1 card from the deck. Hands are kept secret.
6. **Choose Starting Player**: First round only—any player may be chosen. Subsequent rounds begin with the previous round’s winner.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in turns, starting with the starting player and proceeding clockwise.

#### Turn Sequence:
1. **Sanity Check (if applicable)**:  
   - If the player is **insane** (has ≥1 Insanity card in their discard), they must perform a Sanity Check:
     - Reveal the top X cards of the deck, where X = number of Insanity cards in their discard.
     - If **any** revealed card is an Insanity card (Necronomicon or Cthulhu), the player is **knocked out of the round**.
     - All revealed cards go to the player’s discard pile (effects not applied, **except** Necronomicon and Cthulhu Sane effect, which trigger immediately if revealed).
     - If the deck is empty and a Sanity Check cannot be completed, the round ends immediately.
2. **Draw**: Draw the top card from the deck (hand now has 2 cards).
3. **Play**: Choose one card from your hand to play. Apply its effect immediately.
   - If the card has **Sane and Insane effects**, you may choose the **Insane effect only if you are insane**.
   - You **must** apply the chosen effect, even if detrimental.
4. **Discard**: Place the played card in your discard pile (face up, visible to all).
5. **End Turn**: Play passes to the next player.

#### Insanity Rules:
- A player becomes **insane** as soon as an **Insanity card** (Necronomicon or Cthulhu) enters their discard pile.
- While insane, the player may choose the **Insane effect** when playing a dual-effect card.
- Insane players must perform a **Sanity Check** at the start of every turn.

#### Knocked Out of the Round:
A player is knocked out if:
- They fail a Sanity Check (reveal an Insanity card).
- A card effect directly knocks them out (e.g., Investigators guesses correctly).
- They play or discard The Necronomicon or Cthulhu (Sane effect).
- They play Mi-Go Braincase.
- They lose a Great Race of Yith or Hound of Tindalos comparison.
- They are forced to discard by Professor Henry Armitage or Mi-Go and the discarded card is Necronomicon or Cthulhu.

Knocked-out players:
- Discard their current hand without effect.
- Take no further actions until the next round.
- Cannot be targeted by card effects.

- **Discard Order**: Cards are discarded **after** their effects are resolved.
- **Hand Size**: Always 1 card unless an effect grants temporary second card.
