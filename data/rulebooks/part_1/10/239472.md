### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Abomination: The Heir of Frankenstein*, players are scientists in 1819 Paris competing to reanimate a monster from body parts, continuing the work of Victor Frankenstein. A mysterious benefactor (the Creature) sponsors the competition, while Captain Walton seeks to destroy it.

9. Each player takes:
   - 1 Character Card
   - 1 Laboratory Board
   - 1 Anatomy Card
   - 1 Player Reference Card
   - Francs = player count
   - 4 Scientist Meeples, 3 Assistant Meeples, 1 Score Marker (matching lab color)
10. Set attribute dials: Humanity = 0, Reputation = 1, Expertise = 1.
11. Place 1 Scientist and 2 Assistants on character card; rest aside.
12. Place score marker on 0 of score track.
13. Randomly determine First Player; give them First Player Creature Meeple.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round has 4 phases:
1. **Event Phase**: First Player draws and resolves top event/encounter card.
2. **City Phase**: Players take turns placing meeples on locations (Paris or Lab), resolving effects.
3. **Lab Phase**: All players simultaneously:
   - Build Monster Parts (multiple times)
   - Throw the Switch (once)
   - Preserve Materials (multiple times)
4. **Reset Phase**:
   - Decompose materials (unless ice block present)
   - Refresh cards (Hospital, Docks, Academy, Saint-Roch)
   - Return meeples to character cards
   - Advance Captain meeple 1 space (end game if reaches last space)

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Worker Placement
- Place Scientist or Assistant meeples on locations.
- Only Scientists can use certain spaces (marked).
- Bumping: Move opponent’s meeple to Bump Track, pay cost in Francs. Can bump own meeples for 0 cost if space available.
- First Player space: Take First Player meeple; cannot be bumped.

#### Building Monster Parts
1. Choose part (max 1 Head, 1 Torso, 2 Arms, 2 Legs).
2. Meet Expertise requirement.
3. Discard required materials (note worst decomposition stage).
4. Place muscle-side token on operating table (or flip to skin side if completing).
5. Gain 1 Expertise and VPs based on worst material stage, minus penalties for animal parts.

#### Throwing the Switch
- Requires at least 1 completed (skin-side) part.
- Flip 1–3 charged Leyden Jars.
- Roll 2 gray dice per jar flipped.
- Resolve results in order:
  1. **Damage (🡺)**: Place 1 marker per result. Cannot place second marker until all parts have one. If second marker placed, downgrade part and remove all damage.
  2. **Negative Humanity (🖤)**: Lose 1 Humanity (max 1 per roll).
  3. **Alive (⊙)**: Pay 1 Humanity per result to place ⊙ marker on skin-side part (Baptiste pays 2 Reputation).
  4. **Blank (⚡)**: No effect.
- Can use research cards for dice mitigation/re-rolls.

#### Attributes & Dials
- **Humanity**: Gain via Saint-Roch, Hospital Volunteer, Humanity cards, Dog Catcher. Max gain/loss per action is 1 unless specified. At -10, cannot gain/lose Humanity.
- **Reputation**: Gain via Lecture, Donate, Volunteer, Humanity, increase Humanity.
- **Expertise**: Gain via Advanced Research, Practice, Build/Complete Part, Cadaver/Scoundrel cards.
- **Francs**: Earn via Work, Sell, Lecture, Research cards, being bumped.
- Dial Icons (resolve when passed):
  - Gain 1 Assistant
  - Exchange 1 Assistant for 1 Scientist
  - Gain 1 Reputation
  - Lose 1 Reputation
  - Lose 1 Assistant (or Scientist if all upgraded)
  - Upgrade 1 gray die to blue (2 at 20 Expertise)
  - VP at game end based on highest dial value

#### Card Management
- Hand limit: 3 Research, 3 Humanity cards.
- Draw 4th? Discard one first.
- Play for effect (icons or text), then discard to bottom of deck.
- Research cards: Can play during action or for dice mitigation.

#### Materials & Decomposition
- Materials have decomposition stages I–IV (I freshest).
- Max 15 per stage on decomposition track.
- Bone: Max 12, never decomposes, added to bone space.
- Decompose: Without ice block, discard stage IV materials and stage II blood, shift I–III right.
- Ice block: Prevents decomposition; solid → half-melted → discarded.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends when:
- Captain reaches final story track space, or
- One or more players have all 6 monster parts alive at end of Lab Phase.

**End Game Scoring**:
1. **Alive Points**: VP for each part with ⊙ marker (from Anatomy Card).
2. **Bonus Objectives**: 10 VP each for achieved objectives.
3. **Reputation & Expertise Dials**: VP equal to highest value reached.
4. **Humanity Dial**: VP equal to highest or lowest value reached (player chooses gain or loss).
5. **Captain End**: If game ends via Captain, player with highest positive Humanity gains 5 VP (all tied players gain 5).

**Tiebreakers**:
1. Most alive monster parts
2. Most Francs
3. Turn order (First Player, then clockwise)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Downgraded Parts**: Do not lose EXPERTISE or VPs gained when built; can gain again if rebuilt.
- **Bumping**: Can bump own meeples for 0 cost if Bump Track has space.
- **Dice Rolling**: Must roll all dice at once; cannot roll one at a time.
- **Humanity at -10**: Cannot gain/lose Humanity; can still gain benefits from actions that would cost Humanity.
- **Reversing Dial Effects**: If dial moves past a space in opposite direction, undo the effect (e.g., lose Assistant if Reputation drops below 7).
- **Encounter Cards**: Must be resolved when triggered; if forgotten, discard without effect.
- **Animal Parts**: Can substitute for most materials, but not for level 3/4 blood. Penalizes VPs when building.
- **Preserved Materials**: Can only be sold at Market; cannot be used to build parts.
