     - Tie: Flip flag coin.

2. **Begin Match**  
   - First player reveals top card, places it in their park half, and puts flag on it. This card is now **in flag possession**.

3. **Attack Sequence**  
   - The player **without** the flag is on the **attack**.  
   - Reveal cards one by one from the top of your deck.  
   - Total power = sum of base power + power bonuses of all revealed cards in the current attack.  
   - Stop when total power **meets or exceeds** the card in flag possession.  
   - Take the flag and place it on your **last revealed card**.  
   - Slide all other revealed cards from that attack **underneath** the new flag card.

4. **Bench Placement**  
   - The player who lost the flag places that card and all cards underneath it **on their bench** (6 seats).  
   - Cards with the same name go on the same seat (cumulative effects apply).

5. **Switch Roles**  
   - Opponent is now on the attack. Repeat attack and bench steps.

6. **Win Condition**  
   A player wins the match if **either** happens during the opponent’s turn:
   - **Cannot Attack**: Opponent cannot reveal enough cards to match or exceed the flag card’s power (e.g., runs out of cards).  
   - **Bench Full**: Opponent must place cards on the bench but has **no empty seat** available.  

7. **Claim Trophy**  
   - Winner takes the **top trophy** from their park’s stack.  
   - Keep fans ★ on back **hidden** from other players.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I look at my deck during Match Phase?**  
  No. Only if a card effect allows it.  
- **Can I rearrange my deck?**  
  No, except via effects (e.g., Clairvoyant puts card on top).  
- **What if I pick a card with “When picked” effect but then remove it later?**  
  Effect still triggers when picked. Removal doesn’t undo it.  
- **Do bench effects stack for multiple copies?**  
  Yes. “From the bench” effects are cumulative for same-name cards.  
- **When does “Flag loss” trigger?**  
  Only when a card **loses** the flag (i.e., was in possession). Triggers **before** new flag possession effects.  
- **Can I use “During the attack” effects after gaining flag?**  
  No. Those effects end when a card gains flag possession.  
- **What if both players run out of cards simultaneously?**  
  The player **on attack** fails to meet power requirement → defending player wins.  
- **Can I remove cards after drawing but before picking?**  
  No. Removal is **after** picking, at end of Deck Phase.
