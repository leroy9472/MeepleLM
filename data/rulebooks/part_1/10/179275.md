- Each adventure features a different Hero facing a unique Boss across three floors.

- Bonuses are only active during that specific adventure and do not carry over.

4. Gameplay Flow

- The campaign proceeds adventure by adventure.  
- If an adventure is lost, choose to retry from the beginning or sacrifice one Bonus and retry with remaining Bonuses.

5. Core Mechanics

- Floor 2 (First Aid): When you use a potion, heal 1 additional damage.  
- Floor 3 (Speed): Ignore one cost (including choice costs on Perils).  
- Boss (Direct Hit): Increase any one die by 1 during a Combat encounter.

**Adventure 2: Warrior vs Yeti**  
- Floor 2 (Veteran): Start the game with any one Basic Skill.  
- Floor 3 (Guile): Use a die as any color.  
- Boss (Grit): After each Boss round, heal 1 damage.

**Adventure 3: Mage vs Minotaur**  
- Floor 2 (Prepared): Start the game with an extra potion.

**Adventure 5: Rogue vs Dragon**  
- Floor 2 (Fortitude): Reroll all of your 1s and 2s once per encounter.  
- Floor 3 (Recovery): When you descend, heal 1 damage.  
- Boss (Foresight): Reroll one die per encounter.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Victory Condition: Successfully defeat all five Bosses across the five adventures.  
- Loss Condition: Fail an adventure and either fail again on retry or lack Bonuses to sacrifice for retry.  
- No cumulative scoring; success is binary per adventure.  
- Progress is tracked by completing each adventure in sequence.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Do Bonuses stack within an adventure?  
  A: Yes. Once unlocked on a floor, the Bonus remains active for all subsequent floors and the Boss fight in that adventure.

- Q: Can I use multiple rerolls with Fortitude (Rogue vs Dragon)?  
  A: No. Fortitude allows rerolling all 1s and 2s once per encounter.

- Q: How does “Ignore one cost” (Speed) work on Perils?  
  A: It allows skipping a time or damage cost associated with a Peril choice.

- Q: Can I sacrifice more than one Bonus to retry?  
  A: No. Only one Bonus may be sacrificed per retry.

- Q: Is healing from Grit (Warrior) and Recovery (Rogue) automatic?  
  A: Yes. Heal 1 damage immediately after each Boss round (Grit) or upon descending (Recovery).
