# Among the Stars - Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
After a devastating intergalactic war, the major alien races formed the Alliance to promote peace, trade, and diplomacy. Players take on the role of leaders of alien races building space stations to serve as beacons of hope. The objective is to build the most efficient station over four years (rounds) and earn the most Victory Points (VPs). VPs are earned during play, from card abilities, meeting objectives, and end-game scoring. The player with the highest VP total wins.

## 3. Setup
### Base Setup (Non-Aggressive Mode)
1. **Separate Cards**: Separate Basic Location Cards from Special Location Cards (marked with "S" in lower right).  
2. **Adjust for Player Count**:
   - 3 players: Remove Basic Location Cards marked "4".
   - 2 players: Follow 4-player setup with virtual players (see below).
3. **Build Location Deck**:
   - Draw 6 Special Location Cards per player and shuffle into Basic Location Cards.
   - Example: 3 players → 18 Specials + all Basics (minus "4" cards) = Location Deck.
4. **Prepare Power Reactors**: Place Power Reactor Cards in a separate deck near the Score Board.
5. **Score Track**: Each player places a marker at 0 on the Score Board.
6. **Main Reactors**: Each player places their Main Reactor card in front of them with 2 Energy Cubes on it.
7. **Supply**: Place credits and Energy Cubes in the center (Supply).
8. **Optional Elements**:
   - **Races**: Shuffle Race Tiles; each player chooses or is dealt one.
   - **Objectives**: Shuffle Objective Cards; reveal face-up number equal to players.
   - **Aggressive Mode**: Shuffle Conflict Cards into deck at start of Year 2 (see below).

### 2-Player Variant
- Use 4-player setup: 2 real players, 2 virtual players.
- Virtual players:
  - Draw 6 cards each round but do not place markers, reactors, or receive credits.
  - Only 2 Objective Cards are used.
- Card Passing:
  - After selecting a card, pass remaining cards to adjacent virtual player.
  - Shuffle virtual player’s hand, remove 1 card randomly (place face-up in separate pile), pass rest to opponent.
  - Players may choose which card to remove for a more tactical game.

### Aggressive Mode Setup
- Use 12 Conflict Cards.
- After Year 1, shuffle 3 × player count Conflict Cards into Location Deck (e.g., 9 for 3 players).
- From Year 2 onward, each player draws 7 cards per round instead of 6.

### Ambassadors Expansion Setup
- **Ambassadors**: Use 3 for 2–4 players, 4 for 5–6 players.
- **Deck Building**:
  - Pick 15 Basic Locations (mix of base and Ambassadors sets).
  - Add 3–4 copies depending on player count.
  - Add 27–48 random Specials (see player count table).
- Shuffle into Location Deck.

### Other Options
- **Large Locations**: Include only left half of each in deck.
- **Expanding the Alliance / Revival**: Include corresponding cards.
- **Advisors**: Deal 1 Influence tile and 1 Advisor card per player.
- **Blueprints**: Deal 3 secret cards per player; each must keep at least 1.
- **Experimental Reactors / Events / Alliance Inspection**: Include decks if selected.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 4 rounds ("years"). Each round consists of 6 turns.

### Round Start
1. Each player takes 10 credits.
2. Draw 6 cards (7 if Aggressive Mode active).
3. Move Year Marker to current year; note passing direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise).

### Turn Sequence (Simultaneous)
1. **Select**: Each player chooses one card from hand and places it face down.
2. **Pass**: Pass remaining cards to next player (direction per Year Marker).
3. **Reveal & Act**: All players reveal selected card and choose one action:

#### Action 1: Build Location
- Place card orthogonally adjacent to existing card in your station.
- Pay credit cost (top right of card).
- Pay energy cost (if any) using Energy Cubes from reactors within 2 distance (orthogonal path).
- Gain VPs (bottom left of card).
- Resolve ability:
  - **White Box**: Immediate effect.
  - **Gold/Yellow Box**: Effect scored at game end.
- "Max 1" locations: Only one copy of each named card may be built.

#### Action 2: Discard and Build Power Reactor
- Discard selected card.
- Pay 1 credit.
- Take a Power Reactor card and place it adjacent to existing location.
- Place 2 Energy Cubes on it.
- Reactors provide energy and count as locations but have no color/type.

#### Action 3: Discard and Gain 3 Credits
- Discard selected card.
- Gain 3 credits from Supply.

### Playing Order & Timing
- Most actions are simultaneous.
- When abilities affect other players (e.g., take credits), resolve after all build/discard actions.
- If multiple players trigger effects simultaneously, resolve in order of current VP (high to low). Tiebreaker: most credits, then random.

### Passing Direction by Year
- Year 1 & 3: Pass left (clockwise).
- Year 2 & 4: Pass right (counter-clockwise).

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Adjacency**: Cards are adjacent only if sharing top, bottom, left, or right edge. Diagonal does not count.
- **Distance**: Number of orthogonal steps through built locations. Split stations do not count.
- **Energy Payment**: Energy Cubes may be taken from any reactor(s) within 2 distance. Multiple reactors may contribute.
- **Card Drafting**: Hand management and passing are central. Strategic discarding and building are key.
- **Virtual Players (2P)**: Cards removed from virtual hands are not in play and cannot be targeted by abilities referencing other stations.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
After 4 rounds, calculate final score:

1. **Objectives**: Gain VPs for met Objectives. Only one player may claim each. In case of tie, no one gains VPs.
2. **Delayed Abilities**: Gain VPs from abilities in gold/yellow boxes.
3. **Empty Power Reactors**: Gain 1 VP for each Power Reactor (including Main Reactor) with no Energy Cubes on top.
4. **Remaining Credits**: Gain 1 VP per 3 credits (rounded down).

### Final VP Calculation Example
- Base score: 63 VPs  
- Delayed abilities: +7 VPs  
- Empty reactors: 3 (Main + 2 Power) → +3 VPs  
- Credits: 5 → +1 VP  
- Objectives: +5 VPs (most Military)  
- Total: 79 VPs  

### Tiebreaker
1. Most locations (excluding Power Reactors).  
2. Most remaining credits.  
3. Shared victory.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Energy from Multiple Reactors**: Yes, as long as within 2 distance and total cost is met.
- **Distance Example**: If no direct path, distance is longer. E.g., A to B with gap → distance = 4.
- **"Max 1" Violation**: At round end, remove excess cards. Lose VPs gained, no credit refund.
- **Split Station**: Replace removed card with face-down Power Reactor as placeholder. Not counted in location total.
- **Qualeen Ability**: Reveals "Accelerated Construction" Objective immediately when fulfilled.
- **Humareen**: Gains VPs only for types actually built.
- **Restaurant Bonus**: Counts itself as Recreational location.
- **Sports Arena**: Bonus based on remaining years (e.g., built in Year 2 → +2).
- **Communications Beacon**: Gets bonus if tied for farthest from Main Reactor.
- **Negative VPs**: Player score cannot go below 0.
