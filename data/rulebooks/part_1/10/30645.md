### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Ward Elections (Held Every 4 Years)  
Elections occur in active wards in sequence:  
- Start with **Zone I, Ward 1**, follow arrows.  
- Then **Zone II, Ward 9**, follow arrows.  
- Then **Zone III, Ward 17**, follow arrows.  
- Only resolve elections in **active zones**.

**Winning a Ward**:  
- Players **must have at least one ward boss** in the ward to compete.  
- Each ward boss = 1 vote.  
- Players may **secretly bid** political favor chips matching **any immigrant color present** in the ward.  
- **All players announce** how many favor chips they have of each eligible color (public info).  
- Bids are **sealed** (e.g., in closed fist), then revealed simultaneously.  
- Add bid chips to ward boss count. Highest total wins.  
- **Tie**: No one wins. All ward bosses removed.  
- **Winner** leaves **one ward boss** in the ward; others remove all theirs.  
- All **bid chips** are returned to the supply.

**Special Ward Bonuses (immediately after winning)**:  
- **Ward 1 or 2**: Place **1 immigrant cube** (any color) from supply into **any active ward**. No favor chip gained.  
- **Ward 4 or 7**: Take **1 political favor chip** of any color.

#### Award Political Favor Chips (Post-Election)  
After all ward elections:  
- For **each immigrant color**, the player with the **most total cubes** of that color in **their won wards** becomes **Immigrant Leader** and gains **3 favor chips** of that color.  
- **Tie**: All tied players gain 3 chips.  
- Use Immigrant Leader track to mark leaders.

#### Score Victory Points & Assign Offices  
- **1 VP** per ward won.  
- **Ward 14 (Tammany Hall)**: Worth **2 VP**, still counts as one ward.  
- **Mayor**: Player who wins **most wards** becomes mayor, scores **+3 VP**, and places a ward boss in the Mayor box.

1. Most total political favor chips.  
2. Most green (Irish) favor chips.  
3. Most white (English) favor chips.  
4. Most orange/yellow (German) favor chips.  
5. Most blue (Italian) favor chips.
