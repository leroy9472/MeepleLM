### 1. Lore & Objective
This solitaire variant adapts *Star Wars: The Card Game* into a solo campaign experience spanning key events from the *Rebels* animated series through *Rogue One* and the original trilogy (Episodes 4-6). Players take the role of either the Light Side or the Dark Side, progressing through a series of episodic scenarios. The objective of each episode is to win the game according to the standard rules: the Light Side wins by destroying three of the opponent's objective cards, and the Dark Side wins by advancing the Death Star dial to 12 points (or a higher threshold for certain difficulty settings). Victory in an episode grants bonus cards to be used in the following episode.

### 2. Components
- A complete collection of *Star Wars: The Card Game* cycles, expansions, and core sets is required to assemble the decks as specified.
- "Champion" cards, which substitute for specific units in certain episodes, must be downloaded from the provided Fantasy Flight Games link.
- The game uses the standard components: objective cards, command cards (units, enhancements, events, fate), affiliation cards, Force cards, tokens (focus, damage, shield), the Death Star dial, and the Balance of the Force token.

### 3. Setup
1. **Select Force Allegiances**: Decide if the AI will play the Light Side or the Dark Side and take the corresponding Force cards.
2. **Select and Create Decks**: Choose the pre-constructed decks for both the player and the AI based on the current episode (e.g., for "Liberation of Lothal," the Light Side uses a Jedi deck and the Dark Side uses a Sith deck).
3. **Reveal Affiliation Cards**: Place the appropriate affiliation card for the AI in its play area.
4. **Set Balance of the Force**: Place the Balance of the Force token with the Light Side face up.
5. **Prepare Decks**:
    - Create the **AI Command Deck** by shuffling all cards from the AI's objective sets together.
    - Separate cards with zero Force icons and shuffle the remaining cards to form the initial **AI Command Deck**.
    - Draw a number of cards equal to the AI's Reserve value from the Command Deck to form the **Fate Deck**.
6. **Prepare Tokens**: Gather all focus, damage, and shield tokens into a token pool.
7. **Prepare Death Star Dial**: Set the Death Star dial to zero.
8. **Select Objective Cards**: Take the top three objective cards from both the AI's and the player's objective decks and place them face down in their respective areas.
9. **Draw Starting Hands**: The player draws a hand up to their Reserve size (and may take a mulligan). The AI's starting hand is formed by drawing a number of cards equal to its Reserve value from the AI Command Deck.
10. **Reveal Objectives**: Randomize and reveal the three objective cards for both players, one at a time, resolving any "when this card enters play" effects.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in alternating turns, with the Dark Side always going first. Each player's turn consists of the following phases:
1. **Balance Phase**
2. **Refresh Phase**
3. **Draw Phase**
4. **Deployment Phase**
5. **Conflict Phase**
6. **Force Phase**

The AI's actions are governed by a set of deterministic rules to simulate a human opponent. The player follows the standard game rules.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **AI Command and Fate Decks**: The AI's Command Deck contains all its cards. The Fate Deck is a subset used for Edge Battles. At the start of each AI turn, the Fate Deck is replenished to the AI's Reserve value.
- **AI Deployment Phase**: The AI draws cards from its hand one at a time. It pays for cards using its resource pool until it cannot pay for a card, at which point the deployment phase ends. Fate cards go to the Fate Deck, enhancements are attached to eligible units, and events are played immediately if they have a beneficial impact.
- **AI Attacker/Defender Pools**: At the end of the deployment phase, the AI splits its units into attackers and defenders. The number of attackers is half the total number of units, rounded up. Units with the most Blast damage are prioritized for the attacker pool.
- **AI Conflict Phase**: The AI always attacks the player's objective with the least damage capacity. If the first objective is destroyed, remaining attackers target the next objective in the order they were drawn.
- **AI Force Phase**: The AI commits one unit to the Force each turn, prioritizing the unit with the most Force icons. It can uncommit and re-commit a unit if it has three committed and a better one becomes available.
- **Card Selection Rules**:
    - **AI Card Selection (Positive)**: When the AI must choose a friendly card for a positive effect, it selects the highest-cost card.
    - **AI Card Selection (Negative)**: When the AI must choose a friendly card for a negative effect, it selects the lowest-cost card.
    - **Player Card Selection**: When the AI must choose an enemy (player) card, it selects the highest-cost card.
- **Golden Rule**: The AI will only play a card if it has a beneficial impact on itself or a detrimental impact on the player, and it will always try to maximize that impact.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Light Side Victory**: The game ends immediately if the Light Side destroys three or more of the Dark Side's objective cards.
- **Dark Side Victory**: The game ends immediately if the Death Star dial reaches 12 (or 16, 19, 22, or 25+ for Easy, Normal, Hard, and Insane difficulties when the AI plays the Light Side).
- **Deck-Empty Loss**: A player loses if they must draw a card from their command or objective deck and it is empty. If the AI must draw and cannot, its discard pile is shuffled to form a new command deck.
- **Win Bonus Cards**: If the player wins an episode, they receive specific bonus cards that start in play at the beginning of the next episode with no cost.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **AI Hand Management**: When an effect requires discarding from the AI's hand, discard the top card. When an effect requires drawing for the AI, draw from the Command Deck and add the card to the hand.
- **AI Resource Matching**: The AI ignores resource matching requirements and can spend resources on any card type.
- **AI Cannot Lose on Empty Deck**: If the AI's Command Deck is empty, shuffle its discard pile to form a new deck.
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: If the AI is playing the Light Side, the victory condition for the player is adjusted to a higher Death Star dial value to increase difficulty.
- **Edge Battle Rules**: The AI places one card from its Fate Deck into the Edge Stack for each of its participating units, up to its Reserve value. It will pass if it has two more cards in its stack than the player.
