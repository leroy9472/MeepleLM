## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Forbidden Island is a cooperative adventure in which players take on the roles of adventurers exploring a sinking island to recover four ancient treasures created by the lost Archean civilization: the Earth Stone, Statue of the Wind, Crystal of Fire, and Ocean's Chalice. These artifacts grant control over the elements but are protected by the island’s self-destruct mechanism.

**Objective**:  
Work together to:
- Capture all four treasures by collecting and discarding 4 matching Treasure cards on the correct island tiles.
- Bring all players to Fools' Landing.
- Discard a Helicopter Lift card to escape.

**Victory Condition**: All three above must be true simultaneously.

**Defeat Conditions (any one triggers loss)**:
- Both tiles associated with an unclaimed treasure sink.
- Fools' Landing sinks.
- A player cannot swim to an adjacent tile after their tile sinks (drowning).

- Discard cards to Treasure discard pile.

#### 2. Draw 2 Treasure Cards
- Draw 1 at a time.

  - **Sandbag** (2 in deck): Shore up any 1 tile (even if not adjacent). Can be played at any time.
- **Waters Rise! Card**:

  - Immediately:
    1. Move Water Level up 1 tick.
    2. Shuffle Flood discard pile into top of Flood draw pile.
    3. Discard Waters Rise! to Treasure discard pile.
  - No replacement card drawn.
  - If two Waters Rise! cards drawn in same draw phase:
    - Move Water Level up 2 ticks.
    - Shuffle Flood discard pile only once.

> **Note**: If Treasure deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck before drawing.

#### 3. Draw Flood Cards
- Draw number of Flood cards equal to current Water Level (e.g., 3 at Normal).
- Draw 1 at a time; resolve each immediately.

For each card:
- **Tile is dry**: Flip to flooded.
- **Tile is already flooded**: Sink it.
  - Remove tile and matching Flood card from game.
  - Cannot be saved (even by Sandbag).

**Pawn on Sinking Tile**:
- Must immediately move to adjacent remaining tile (orthogonal).
- **Exceptions**:
  - **Diver**: May swim to any nearest tile (including diagonal if closer).
  - **Explorer**: May swim diagonally.
  - **Pilot**: May fly to any remaining tile.

> If no adjacent tile exists → player drowns → game lost.

> **Note**: If Flood draw pile is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck and continue drawing.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I play a Special Action card during the Flood phase?**  
A: Yes. For example, play Sandbag to shore up a tile *before* it is flooded by a drawn Flood card.

**Q: Can the Navigator use the Pilot’s “fly anywhere” ability?**  
A: No. The Navigator can move the Pilot up to 2 tiles, but cannot use the Pilot’s special action.

**Q: Can I capture a treasure if I’m on a flooded tile?**  
A: Yes. Flooding does not prevent capture.

**Q: What happens if I draw a Waters Rise! card when the Flood discard pile is empty?**  
A: Move Water Level up 1 tick. No shuffling occurs.

**Q: Can the Diver move through multiple missing tiles?**  
A: Yes, as long as the path is linear and ends on a remaining tile.

**Q: Can I give a card to a player who is on a sinking tile?**  
A: Yes, as long as both players were on the same tile *before* the tile sank.

**Q: Can I use a Helicopter Lift to move players to a tile about to be flooded?**  
A: Yes. Movement happens immediately. The tile may flood later in the same turn.

**Q: Do I have to use all 3 actions?**  
A: No. You may take 0, 1, 2, or 3 actions.
