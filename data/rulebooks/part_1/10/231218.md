## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Black Sonata*, you are a scholar in Elizabethan London, circa 1600, pursuing the mysterious Dark Lady of Shakespeare’s sonnets. Your goal is to deduce her three hidden characteristics by gathering clues through careful observation and deduction. The Lady moves secretly across the city via a predetermined path. You must locate her multiple times to gain clues, deduce her traits, and finally confront her before time runs out.  

**Victory**: Successfully deduce all three of the Dark Lady’s characteristics and confront her in person.  
**Defeat**: Fail to confront her correctly, run out of fog cards, or let the countdown card reach zero.

### 2. Components  
- **1 game board**: Map of 11 locations in Elizabethan London, connected by paths.  
- **12 clue cards**: 2 cards per suit across 6 suits:  
  - Rose (red)  
  - Acorn (gold)  
  - Oak (green)  
  - Thistle (teal)  
  - Bluebell (blue)  
  - Sage (purple)  
  Each card features a historical woman and her three traits.  
- **1 clue mask card**: Covers the face-up clue deck to prevent premature suit memorization.  
- **32 stealth cards**: Backs show location landmarks; fronts have sequence letters (used to build movement paths).  
- **1 countdown card**: Thick border; starts at "2" and counts down each time the stealth deck cycles.  
- **11 location keys**: Cards with keyhole cutouts; used to check if the Lady is present during a search.  
- **10 fog cards**: Marked with "?" and no border; used to replace stealth cards during searches.  
- **7 deduction tokens**: Used to track which traits apply to the Dark Lady.  
- **1 player pawn**: Tracks your current location on the board.  
- **4 optional tracker tokens**: Help track possible Lady locations.  

> **Note**: All cards must be opaque. Transparency ruins the hidden movement system.

### 3. Setup  

#### Preparing the Play Area  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Place your **pawn** on any location.  
3. Place **deduction tokens** and optional **tracker tokens** near the lower-left corner.  
4. Shuffle the **fog cards** and place them face down to form the **fog deck**.  

#### Assigning the Dark Lady  
1. Shuffle the 12 **clue cards**.  
2. Take the top card **face down** and tuck it partially under the board — this is the **Dark Lady**.  
3. Find the other card of the **same suit** as the Dark Lady. Place it face down near the board.  
4. Stack all **11 location keys** on top of this suit card.  
5. Adjust difficulty (see *Adjusting the Difficulty*).  
6. Shuffle the remaining clue cards and place them **face up** under the **clue mask card** — this is the **clue deck**.  

#### Preparing the Stealth Deck  
1. Choose one of the **eight movement sequences** (see *Additional Stealth Deck Sequences*).  
2. Sort the **stealth cards** alphabetically (A–Z) by the character in the chosen sequence position.  
   - Optional: Use reverse order (Z–A) for variation.  
3. Discard any stealth cards not in the sequence.  
4. Turn the deck **face down** and **cut** it (move any block from top to bottom) to randomize the starting location.  
5. Set the **countdown card** to "2" and place it on the **bottom** of the stealth deck.  

> The stealth deck is held **face down** during play. The top card’s back shows the Lady’s current location.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this sequence:  

1. **Update the Lady’s Location**  
   - Move the top **stealth card** to the bottom of the deck.  
   - The new top card shows her new location via its back icon.  
   - If the **countdown card** reaches the top:  
     - Flip it to the next lower number (2 → 1 → 0).  
     - Place it at the bottom.  
     - If it shows **0**, the Lady escapes — **you lose**.  

2. **Player Turn: Choose One Action**  
   - **A. Move** your pawn to an adjacent location.  
   - **B. Search** for the Lady (if not blocked by fog).  
   - **C. Use a fog card** (if top of stealth deck is a fog card).  
   - **D. Pass** (do nothing).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Option A: Move Your Pawn  
- Move along a connected path to an adjacent location.  
- When you **first visit a location**, take the top **location key** from the stack and place it in the visited area.  
- Once **all 11 locations are visited**, the **suit card** under the keys is revealed and added to your clue pool.  

#### Option B: Search for the Lady  
**Only available if the top stealth card is NOT a fog card.**  

1. Slide the **top fog card** face down **under** the top stealth card (to hide the next location).  
   - If **no fog cards remain**, you **lose**.  
2. Place the top **stealth card** onto the **location key** matching your current location.  
3. Flip both cards together as a stack.  
   - **If the Lady appears** (black silhouette in the keyhole):  
     - You may **reveal the top clue card** by sliding it out from under the mask.  
     - Or, if you’ve deduced all traits, **confront her** (see *Confronting the Dark Lady*).  
   - **If she does not appear**: She is not here.  
4. **Discard the stealth card**.  
5. **Lady flees**:  
   - Advance the stealth deck by **one card per clue** you currently hold (including the new one, if gained).  
   - Move them as a **block** to avoid seeing them.  
   - **Countdown card** does **not** count toward the number advanced.  
6. After fleeing, the Lady **moves again** (next round starts with update).  

#### Option C: Use a Fog Card  
**Only available if the top stealth card is a fog card.**  

1. Slide a new **fog card** face down under the current fog card.  
   - If **no fog cards remain**, you **lose**.  
2. Flip the top **fog card** to reveal its action.  
3. Perform the action immediately:  
   - **Reveal a new clue card**  
   - **Move your pawn to any location**  
   - **Look ahead at the next five stealth card backs**  
   - **Discard this card and reveal a new clue card**  
4. Place the used fog card on the **bottom of the fog deck** (unless instructed to discard).  

#### Option D: Pass  
- Take no action. Proceed directly to the next round’s location update.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Winning the Game  
To win:  
1. Place **three deduction tokens** on the board’s deduction spaces, correctly matching the Dark Lady’s traits.  
2. On a subsequent turn, **search successfully** in your current location (Lady appears in keyhole).  
3. **Confront her**: Reveal the Dark Lady card.  
   - If your **three tokens exactly match** her traits → **You win!**  
   - If they do **not match** → **You lose.**  

> You **cannot** gain a clue and confront in the same turn.  

#### Scoring (Optional)  
If you win, calculate your score:  
1. Count **stealth cards above** the countdown card (not including it).  
2. Multiply **countdown number** by **sequence length** (e.g., 2 × 26 = 52).  
3. Add **2 points per fog card remaining**.  
4. Apply **difficulty adjustment**:  
   - Easy: –30  
   - Advanced: +5  
   - Expert: +5 per discarded fog card  

**Score Ranks**:  
- <20: Chimney-sweeper  
- 20–40: Golden lad/girl  
- 41–60: Fair youth/maid  
- >60: Immortal bard

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I confront the Lady the same turn I get my third clue?**  
  No. You must have already placed all three deduction tokens before searching to confront.  

- **What happens if I run out of fog cards?**  
  You lose immediately — both when searching and when using fog cards.  

- **Can I use a fog card action if I can’t perform it?**  
  No. If you cannot perform the action (e.g., no clue cards left to reveal), you lose.  

- **Do I advance the deck for fleeing if I have zero clues?**  
  No. Only advance if you have one or more clues.  

- **Does the countdown card count when advancing after a search?**  
  No. It does **not** count toward the number of cards moved, but must still be activated if revealed.  

- **Can I look at the Dark Lady card before confronting?**  
  No. It remains hidden until confrontation.  

- **What if the Lady doesn’t move in a sequence?**  
  Some sequences allow the Lady to stay in place. The top card still moves to the bottom — this maintains the correct path.
