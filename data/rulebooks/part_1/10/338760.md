## Imperial Steam Tips

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Imperial Steam is a strategy board game centered around building rail networks, managing resources, and gaining influence in hub cities across a historical European map. The objective is to maximize your final score through efficient delivery operations, strategic infrastructure development, and influence dominance—particularly in key cities like Trieste.

### 2. Components  
Not specified in source.

### 3. Setup  
- **Influence Bidding**: During initial setup, players bid for influence positions in cities. It is critical to bid high enough to secure access to workers in at least two cities. Falling too low risks being locked out if others occupy the available worker spots.
- **Worker Levels**: All workers level up at the start of round 2. Consider delaying major construction (track and factories) until after this point for increased efficiency.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- The game lasts **6–7 rounds**, typically ending around round 7.
- Players take actions to build rail, construct factories, transport goods, fulfill contracts, and expand influence.
- Income primarily comes from **deliveries**; access to **hub cities** is essential for consistent income.
- Resource market prices drop significantly by mid-game—plan purchases accordingly.

#### Recommended Early Game (Rounds 1–4):  
- Build track **only twice** in rounds 1–4.  
- Focus on securing key factory locations in cities before they’re taken.  
- Use early cash wisely: $40 in round 1 can buy a train + coal, an extra worker, 4 goods, an iron factory, or 4 influence points—many of which increase in cost later.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Shareholders  
- Creating shareholders provides immediate **cash infusions**, which are vital for early momentum.  
- Each shareholder costs **10% of final score** during endgame payout.  
- Having 3 shareholders reduces final score to **70%** (i.e., 700 from a gross 1000).  
- Balance short-term funding with long-term scoring loss.

#### Key Requirements  
- **Coal factories are required to claim city keys**.  
- **Big keys** are worth ~$100; **small keys** ~$50.  
- Keys contribute directly to city influence scoring.

#### Rail & Trieste Connection  
- If you reach **Trieste**, you may cash in contracts.  
- To do so, pay **$20 per connection used** on the shortest route to Trieste.  
- **Influence breaks ties** in route and track usage.

#### Passenger Cars  
- Can support movement but **take up storage space** otherwise used for goods and contracts—use judiciously.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Final scoring occurs after the last round in the following order:

1. **Take Final Income**  
   - Income is doubled if you possess the **Semmering token**.

2. **Sell Goods**  
   - All goods on trains and in warehouses are worth **$10 each**.

3. **Turn In City Keys**  
   - Big keys: ~$100  
   - Small keys: ~$50  
   - Must have a **coal factory** to claim keys.

4. **Player Influence Scoring**  
   - Score based on how many **hub cities** you match or exceed in influence:
     - 4 hub cities: $100  
     - 3 hub cities: $60  
     - 2 hub cities: $30  
     - 1 hub city: $10  

5. **Cash In Contracts**  
   - Only allowed if you have **reached Trieste**.

6. **Pay Rail Usage Fee**  
   - Pay **$20 per connection** used on the **shortest route** to Trieste.  
   - Influence determines tie-breaking for track usage.

7. **Pay Shareholders**  
   - Each shareholder reduces your final score by **10%**.  
   - Example: 3 shareholders → final score × 70%.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Why can’t I claim a city key?**  
  You must own a **coal factory** to claim any city key.

- **How is the route to Trieste determined?**  
  Always use the **shortest path**. In case of ties, **influence level** determines priority.

- **When should I build track?**  
  Recommended: build track only **twice in rounds 1–4**, then once per round afterward. Delaying early builds allows for upgraded workers in round 2.

- **Is creating shareholders worth it?**  
  Yes, especially early. An extra $40 in round 1 can purchase foundational assets before prices rise.
