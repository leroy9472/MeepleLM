## Caverna: Cave vs Cave – Solitaire Campaign Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are the leader of a dwarven tribe carving out a home in a mountain. In this solitaire campaign variant of *Caverna: Cave vs Cave*, your goal is to outperform increasingly difficult scoring thresholds across six games, while gradually adding new challenges to increase difficulty. Success allows you to permanently keep rooms for future games, simulating the growth of your cave over time.

### 3. Setup  
Set up a single-player game with campaign-specific modifications:

1. **Action Board & Tiles**:
   - Use the **1-player side** of the Action Board.
   - Place the 4 Action Tiles with dwarves on the back face-up on the unnumbered spaces (order does not matter).
   - Shuffle the 8 numbered Action Tiles and place them face-down on their matching numbered spaces (2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4).
   - **Remove the "Breach" Action Tile** from play → game lasts **7 rounds**.

2. **Cave Board**:
   - Use only **one Cave Board**.
   - Place Goods Indicators on '1' of each track. Keep Gold's '+10' side face down.
   - **No Start Player Token** is used.

3. **Room Tiles**:
   - Randomly **remove 3 of the 6 Light Grey-backed Rooms** from play.
   - Shuffle the 18 Dark Grey-backed Rooms.
   - Place **9 face-down** on your Cave Board (excluding the space with crossed pickaxes).
   - Form a **face-down draw pile** from the remaining 9 Dark Rooms.

4. **Round Tiles**:
   - You may choose to reveal round tiles in order or randomly — your choice.

5. **Special Rule Override**:
   - The restriction of having **more orange rooms than blue rooms does not apply** in this campaign.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game follows the standard 7-round structure of the solo version, with standard phases per round:

#### Phase 1: New Action  
Reveal the next Action Tile from left to right on the Action Board.

#### Phase 2: Action Phase  
On your turn:
- Choose a face-up Action Tile.
- Perform its action(s) in any order (each once).
- Push the tile to your side to mark it used.
- Tiles can only be used once per round.
- You may skip actions entirely.

**Special Solo Rule**:
- Whenever you **excavate exactly one tile**, flip the **top tile from the draw pile** and place it **face-up in the central display** (available for furnishing).

**Renovation Tile Exception**:
- You may use the Renovation Action Tile **regardless of your Gold amount** (ignore "more gold than opponent" rule).

#### Phase 3: End of Round  
- Each round specifies how many turns you take:
  - Rounds 1–3: 2 turns each
  - Rounds 4–6: 3 turns each
  - Round 7: 4 turns
- Return used Action Tiles to their spots.
- No turn passing (single player).

Game ends after **Round 7**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Excavating a Cavern  
- Remove an **accessible** face-down Room tile from your board (orthogonal path from Cave Entrance, unblocked by walls or other face-down rooms).
- Place it face-up in the **central display**.
- If the tile has "+", gain **1 Food**.
- If you excavate **exactly one tile** during your turn, **flip the top tile from the draw pile** and add it to the central display.

#### Furnishing a Cavern  
- Pay the cost (Wood, Stone, Gold) shown under a Room in the central display.
- Place the Room on an empty cavern space that matches its **wall configuration** (dark = required, light = optional).
- You may **rotate** the tile.
- Some actions require paying **Food or Gold** before furnishing (based on round number).

#### Room Actions  
- **Orange Rooms**: Activate when you take a 1, 2, or 3 Action Tile. Use up to that many **different** orange rooms (mark with Action Markers to avoid reuse).
- **Blue Rooms**: Always active when their trigger occurs.
- You may use the **Anytime Action**: Exchange Emmer, Flax, or Gold 1:1 for Food.

#### Wall Building & Razing  
- **Build Wall**: Spend 1 Food to place a wall between adjacent caverns. Get 2 Gold when you do.
- **Raze Wall**: Remove a wall, return it to supply, and gain the goods shown on the raze action.

#### Additional Cavern  
- If you **fully fill** your cave with face-up rooms, gain the Additional Cavern tile.
- Place it adjacent; it has 2 or 3 natural walls (your choice of side).
- Furnish it like any other cavern.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Final Scoring  
At the end of Round 7:
- Total **Victory Points (VP)** from all built Room Tiles (shown in shields).
- Add **number of Gold** you possess.
- **Other goods (Wood, Stone, Emmer, Flax, Food) are worth 0 VP**.

#### Winning the Campaign Game  
- Compare your score to the **target VP** for the game number:
  - Game 1: 50 VP
  - Game 2: 55 VP
  - Game 3: 59 VP
  - Game 4: 62 VP
  - Game 5: 64 VP
  - Game 6: 65 VP

If you **exceed the target**, you may **keep one room** for future campaign games.

#### Room Retention Rule  
- The **victory point value** of the kept room must be **≤ half the difference** between your score and the target.
- Example: You score **58** in Game 1 (target 50). Difference = **8**. Half = **4**.
  - You may keep **one room worth 4 VP or less**.
- Kept rooms are set aside and can be **automatically included** in future games’ setups (placed on your board or in display, as appropriate).

#### Campaign Progression  
After each game:
- Record your score and kept room (if any).
- **Choose one new challenge** from the list below to apply **permanently** to all future games in the campaign:
  - [ ] Cover the 10th "no tile" space in your cave with a dark tile
  - [ ] Start with 0 Food and 0 Gold
  - [ ] Start with 0 Emmer and 0 Flax
  - [ ] Start with 0 Wood and 0 Stone
  - [ ] Flip over the round track, remove the "Breach" action, and play 7 rounds (likely added by Game 6)

> Note: The last challenge is already in effect if using the solo rules. May indicate a misstatement — possibly meant to **extend to 8 rounds**? But source says "play 7 rounds", which is already standard. Interpret as-is.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I excavate more than once per turn?**  
A: Yes, if an Action Tile allows multiple excavations (e.g., Excavation Tile lets you do 1 or 2). But the **"flip a tile from draw pile" bonus only triggers if you excavate *exactly one* tile** during the turn.

**Q: What happens if the draw pile runs out?**  
A: The rule does not specify a reshuffle. If the pile is empty, the "flip after excavating one tile" effect does nothing.

**Q: Can I keep more than one room per game?**  
A: No. Only **one room** may be kept per game, even if you exceed the target by a large margin.

**Q: When do I apply the campaign challenges?**  
A: Choose **one new challenge after each completed game**. It applies **starting from the next game onward**.

**Q: Can I use a kept room in the same game I earned it?**  
A: No. Kept rooms are saved **for future games**.

**Q: Do kept rooms count toward scoring in future games?**  
A: Yes. Once used in a future game, they are scored normally.

**Q: Is the "more orange than blue rooms" rule active?**  
A: **No.** The campaign explicitly overrides this rule.
