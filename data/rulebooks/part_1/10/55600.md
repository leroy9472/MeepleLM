# Shipyard — Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 1870, steam power is transforming shipbuilding. As a shipyard owner, you compete to build the fastest, safest, and most powerful ships. Your completed vessels undergo shakedown cruises to score points based on speed, crew, equipment, and safety. Secret government contracts provide end-game scoring opportunities. The player with the most points at game end wins, with guilders as the tiebreaker.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A turn consists of 5 steps:  
1. **Advance Previous Action Card**  
2. **Choose New Action**  
3. **Collect Income**  
4. **Perform Action (with optional bonus)**  
5. **Shakedown Cruise (if ship completed)**  

After each lap (lead action returns to start), move countdown marker down. Discard contracts based on player count. Game ends when countdown reaches red space or any ship card stack is exhausted.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Turn Sequence  

**1. Advance Previous Action Card**  
- **3–4 players:** Move your action card to front of Action Track.  
- **2 players:** Move the card marked by two figures to front; place one figure next to the figure on your previous action.  
- Special: If lead catches up to last card, move trailing cards forward to maintain at least one empty space ahead.  

**2. Choose New Action**  
- Place your action marker on any unoccupied action **except** the one just moved to front.  
- You must be able to perform the action.  
- 2-player: On first turn, place two markers on same action.  

**3. Collect Income**  
- Earn **1 guilder per occupied action ahead** of your chosen action.  
- If you are furthest behind, earn **+1 guilder per 3 empty spaces** immediately before next action (rounded down).  

**4. Perform Chosen Action**  
Available actions:  
- **Build Ships:** Buy 1–3 ship cards (cost: 0–2 guilders). Must place legally (no gaps, must eventually complete ship).  
- **Purchase Commodities:** Buy 1 freight train (cost: 0–2 guilders).  
- **Rent Canal:** Buy 1 canal tile; connect to existing system. First tile: place ship figure on entry space.
