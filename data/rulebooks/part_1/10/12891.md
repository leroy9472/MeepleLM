# Friedrich – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

**Lore:**  
Friedrich is a strategic board game inspired by the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763). Frederick the Great of Prussia faces a coalition of European powers: Austria, France, Russia, Sweden, and the Holy Roman Empire. With only Hanover as an ally, Prussia is surrounded. The game captures the historical turning point when the sudden death of Empress Elizabeth of Russia led to peace, saving Prussia from defeat.

**Victory Conditions:**  
- **Prussia/Hanover (Frederick):** Wins when three of the four attacking nations (Russia, Sweden, Austria, France) exit the game due to historical events (e.g., death of a ruler). This ends the game immediately.  
- **Attackers (Russia, Sweden, Austria, Imperial Army, France):** Win by conquering all of their nation-specific objectives.  
  - **Russia:** 10 objectives  
  - **Sweden:** 5 objectives  
  - **Austria:** 12 objectives (8 primary, 4 secondary)  
  - **Imperial Army:** 5 objectives (2 primary, 3 secondary)  
  - **France:** 10 objectives  

**Eased Victory Conditions:**  
- If Russia and Sweden exit, **Elizabeth** takes control of the Imperial Army.  
- If France exits, **Pompadour** takes control of the Imperial Army.  
- When the Imperial Army changes hands, Austria and the Imperial Army only need to control their primary objectives to win.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

Each turn proceeds in the following order:  
1. **Prussia**  
2. **Hanover**  
3. **Russia**  
4. **Sweden**  
5. **Austria**  
6. **Imperial Army**  
7. **France**

Each nation’s action stage consists of:  
1. **Draw Tactical Cards** (number varies by nation and game phase)  
2. **Movement** (generals up to 3 cities, 4 on main roads; supply trains move one less)  
3. **Combat** (mandatory if adjacent to enemy)  
4. **Subsequent Conquests** (if enemy retreats, previously protected objectives may be conquered)  
5. **Supply Check** (face-down if out of supply; lose armies if still out next turn)

**Clock of Fate:**  
- Begins on turn 6.  
- At end of each turn, draw and resolve top Card of Fate.  
- Cards may reduce TC draws (e.g., English subsidy loss: Prussia and Hanover draw 4 and 1 instead of 7 and 2).  
- Game ends when three attackers exit (Prussia wins).

### 5. Core Mechanics

**Tactical Cards (TC):**  
- Used in combat and recruitment.  
- Value 2–13 in suits: spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs.  
- **Reserve Card:** Can be any suit and value 1–10 when played.  
- Discarded TC are sorted by suit; new decks used when exhausted.

**Combat:**  
- Triggered when a general is adjacent to an enemy.  
- **Initial Score:** Difference in army strength (negative for weaker player).  
- Weaker player plays first, adding TC value to score.  
- Once score ≥ 0, turn passes to other player.  
- Combat ends when a player cannot or will not play a TC.  
- **Defeat:** Loser loses armies equal to negative final score and retreats that many cities. Winner loses no armies.  
- **Score of 0:** Attacker plays first. Defender must play a TC of correct suit or accept draw (no loss, no retreat).

**Retreat:**  
- Directed by winner.  
- Must move as far as possible from victor.  
- Cannot revisit cities, jump units, or conquer objectives.  
- If retreat impossible, all armies lost.

**Supply:**  
- **Home Country:** Always in supply.  
- **Abroad:** Must be within 6 cities of own supply train via unblocked path.  
- **Out of Supply:** General flipped face-down. If still out next turn, loses all armies.  
- **Face-Down Generals:** Can move and fight. Stacks with face-up general become face-down.

**Recruitment:**  
- Costs 6 TC points per army, 6 per supply train, generals free (but require 6 points for first army).  
- Re-entry at depot cities. If blocked, use substitute re-entry sites (e.g., Prussia → Berlin spades sector).  
- Costs increase to 8 TC if depot is blocked.

**Objective Conquest:**  
- Conquered by moving over an unprotected objective.  
- Protected if enemy general is within 3 cities.  
- **Subsequent Conquest:** If objective is protected during movement, it can be conquered if all protecting generals retreat far enough during combat.  
- **Reconquest:** Only original nation can reconquer.

**Stacking:**  
- Up to 3 generals can stack on one city.  
- Treated as one unit until split.  
- Movement ends when stacking or splitting.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

**Win Conditions:**  
- **Prussia:** Wins when three attackers (Russia, Sweden, France, or Austria) exit due to Cards of Fate.  
- **Attackers:** Win by controlling all their objectives.  
  - Austria and Imperial Army may win with only primary objectives if Imperial Army changed hands.  
  - Sweden may win with only primary objectives if Russia exited.

**End Game Triggers:**  
- A nation wins if it controls all required objectives **before** or **after** drawing a Card of Fate.  
- If two nations win simultaneously, both win.  
- Prussia wins when three attackers exit (game ends immediately).

**Offensive Option (Expert Rule):**  
- Prussia may attempt to win by conquering all 14 Bohemian objectives.  
- Must declare intent in turn 3, setting aside a TC ≥10.  
- If Austria receives this card (via Prussian loss or supply failure), and a subsidy reduction occurs, the option fails.  
- If successful, Prussia wins. Otherwise, victory only by survival.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

**Q: Can Hanover and Prussia defend each other’s objectives?**  
A: No. Each nation defends only its own objectives and home territory.

**Q: What happens if a supply train is destroyed?**  
A: It is removed. Can be rebuilt for 6 TC points at depot or substitute site.

**Q: Can a general be out of supply during movement?**  
A: Yes. Supply is only checked at the end of the nation’s action stage.

**Q: Can you block an ally’s objective?**  
A: No. Intentionally blocking an ally’s objective is against the rules.

**Q: What if all TC of a suit are gone?**  
A: TC are reused when sets are exhausted. Fourth set used first, then rotate between most accumulated sets.

**Q: Can a Reserve card be used to stop combat on 0?**  
A: Yes. If no matching suit TC, player may play Reserve or accept draw.

**Q: What if a general cannot retreat the full distance?**  
A: Loses all armies.

**Q: Can stacked generals have different supply status?**  
A: No. If a face-up and face-down general stack, both become face-down.
