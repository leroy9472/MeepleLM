# Fugitive — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
After a successful heist, the Fugitive attempts to escape by moving from hideout to hideout. The Marshal pursues, trying to deduce the Fugitive’s path.  

**Win Conditions:**  
- **Fugitive wins** by playing Hideout 42, *unless* a Manhunt is triggered and the Marshal succeeds.  
- **Marshal wins** by correctly guessing *all* of the Fugitive’s hideouts, either during regular turns or via a successful Manhunt.

---

### 2. Components  
- **43 Hideout cards (numbered 0–42)**  
  - Each has a Hideout number and a Sprint value (+1 or +2, shown as footprints).  
- **Notepad and pen** (for the Marshal)  
- **Optional: Event cards and Placeholder cards**  
  - Event cards have effects that help the Fugitive, Marshal, or are neutral.  
  - Placeholder cards are used in Catchup Events variant.

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Place **Hideout 0** face-up in the center — this is the starting point.  
2. Sort remaining Hideout cards into three decks:  
   - **Deck A (4–14)**  
   - **Deck B (15–28)**  
   - **Deck C (29–41)**  
   Shuffle each deck and place them face-down.  
3. **Fugitive’s starting hand:**  
   - Cards **1, 2, 3, and 42**  
   - Draw **3 cards** from Deck A (4–14)  
   - Draw **2 cards** from Deck B (15–28)  
   - Draw **0 cards** from Deck C (29–41)  
4. **Marshal:** Receives the notepad and pen. No starting hand.  
5. **Optional Event Setup:** See *Game Play Variants*.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players alternate turns. **Fugitive goes first.**

#### First Turn:  
- **Fugitive:** Places **1 or 2** Hideout cards face-down to the right of Hideout 0.  
- **Marshal:** Draws **2 cards** (from any decks), then makes **one or more guesses**.

#### Subsequent Turns:  
- **Fugitive:**  
  1. Draws **1 card** from any deck.  
  2. May place **0 or 1** Hideout card face-down to the right of the last Hideout.  
     - If placing **0**, may draw **1 extra card** from the **lowest-numbered deck** that still has cards.  
  3. Can look at any face-down card in the center row at any time.  
- **Marshal:**  
  1. Draws **1 card** from any deck.  
  2. Makes **one or more guesses** (see *Guessing Rules* below).

Play continues until a win condition is met.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Placing Hideouts  
- A Hideout card must have a number **1, 2, or 3 higher** than the previous Hideout.  
- Cannot place a card with a **lower number** than the last Hideout.  
- Example: After #7, valid plays are #8, #9, or #10.

#### Sprinting  
- To jump **more than 3** above the last Hideout, the Fugitive must use **Sprint cards**.  
- Place **extra cards face-down under** the new Hideout — these are **Sprint cards**.  
- The **total Sprint value** (sum of footprints) must cover the excess.  
  - Example: From #7 to #12 → gap = 5 → need +2 Sprint (since normal max jump is +3).  
- The **number of Sprint cards played must be visible** (but not their values).  
- Fugitive may play **extra Sprint cards** (bluffing).  
- **No Sprint needed** for gaps ≤3.

#### Marshal’s Guessing  
- Marshal **announces one or more numbers** (1–41).  
- **If all guesses are correct:** Fugitive reveals each matching Hideout and its Sprint cards.  
- **If any guess is wrong:** **No cards are revealed**, even if some were correct.  
- Marshal **never guesses Sprint cards** — only Hideout numbers.

#### Manhunt  
Triggered **only when**:  
- Fugitive plays **Hideout 42**  
- AND the **highest revealed Hideout is #29 or lower**  

Then:  
- Marshal begins a **Manhunt** (immediately, out of turn order).  
- She guesses **one Hideout at a time**, face-down or not.  
  - If correct → continues.  
  - If wrong → Manhunt fails → **Fugitive wins**.  
- If she guesses **all remaining Hideouts correctly** → **Marshal wins**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **No scoring system** — game ends when a win condition is met.  
- **Fugitive wins** by playing #42 *and surviving Manhunt (if triggered)*.  
- **Marshal wins** by guessing **all** Hideouts (during play or Manhunt).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can the Fugitive skip playing a card?**  
  Yes. He may pass (place 0 cards). If he does, he may draw an extra card from the lowest available deck.

- **Can the Fugitive play Hideout 42 at any time?**  
  Only if it is 1–3 higher than the last Hideout, or with enough Sprint cards to reach it.

- **Can the Marshal guess #0 or #42?**  
  - **#0**: No — it’s already revealed.  
  - **#42**: Yes — but only *after* it has been played face-down. Once played, it’s a valid guess.

- **What happens when a player draws an Event card?**  
  - Resolve the event **immediately**, then draw **another card** to replace it.  
  - Exact setup depends on variant (see *Game Play Variants*).

- **Can the Fugitive look at his own played face-down cards?**  
  Yes — at any time.

- **Does the Marshal need to guess in order?**  
  No — she can guess any number at any time.

- **What if the Fugitive plays #42 but all Hideouts are already revealed?**  
  Fugitive wins immediately — no Manhunt (since Manhunt only triggers if highest revealed is ≤29).

- When Marshal **successfully guesses one or more Hideouts**, Fugitive draws and resolves one Event card.  
- Placeholder cards not used.

#### Helpful Events  
- Choose a player to help (Fugitive or Marshal).  
- Take all Event cards with that player’s icon.  
- Shuffle them **evenly into the three decks**.

- Other Event/Placeholder cards not used.

#### Catchup Events  
- Sort Event cards into 3 piles: Fugitive, Marshal, Neutral.  
- Shuffle 2 **Placeholder cards** into each of the three Hideout decks.  
- When a player draws a Placeholder:  
  - **1 face-down Hideout**: Draw Event from **Fugitive’s pile**  
  - **2 face-down Hideouts**: Draw from **Neutral pile**  
  - **3+ face-down Hideouts**: Draw from **Marshal’s pile**  
- Resolve event, then draw another card.
