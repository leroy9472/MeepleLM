## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Morels is a light strategy card game centered around foraging mushrooms in a forest. Players take turns collecting, selling, and cooking mushrooms to earn Mushroom Varietal Points (MVPs). The goal is to score the most MVPs by cooking sets of mushrooms before the forest is depleted.

### 2. Components  
- **Day Deck**: Contains mushroom cards including:
  - Morels (3)
  - Honey Fungus (10)
  - Tree Ear (8)
  - Lawyer’s Wig (6)
  - Hen of the Woods (5)
  - Shiitake (5)
  - Porcini (4)
  - Chanterelle (4)
  - Fairy Ring (4)
  - Baskets (5): Increase hand size
  - Destroying Angels (5): Reduce hand size
  - Moons (8): Trigger draw from Night Deck
  - Pans (11)
  - Butter (3): +3 MVP when cooking ≥4 mushrooms
  - Cider (3): +5 MVP when cooking ≥5 mushrooms
- **Night Deck**: Contains night versions of the 8 non-Morel mushrooms (1 of each). Night cards count as 2 mushrooms for cooking/selling.
- **Foraging Sticks**: Infinite supply; used to take cards from deeper in the forest.
- **Pan Tokens**: 1 per player at start; used for cooking.
- **Optional Foray Expansion Cards**: e.g., Rainstorm, Thief, Chef (used in solo variant).

### 3. Setup  
- Each player receives:
  - 1 pan token in play
  - 3 cards from the Day Deck
- Play Area:
  - 8 face-up cards from the Day Deck form the **forest**, laid out in a line or circle.
  - Foraging sticks placed nearby.
  - Night Deck shuffled and set aside.
- **Opening Hand Rules**:
  - **Basket**: Immediately place into play; increases hand size by 2.
  - **Moon**: Discard and draw a Night card (counts as 2 mushrooms).
  - **Destroying Angel**: Discard immediately (no replacement); reduces hand size temporarily.
- Hand size limit starts at 8 cards.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, choose **one** main action:

#### a) Take 1 card from the forest  
- You may take the **first or second card** (closest to decay) for free.
- To take a card from **position 3–8**, pay 1 foraging stick per position beyond the second (e.g., 4th card costs 2 sticks).
- You **cannot** exceed your hand limit when taking a card.
- **Card Effects Upon Pickup**:
  - **Basket / Destroying Angel**: Goes directly into play; does not enter hand.
  - **Moon**: Discard immediately and draw a Night card.
- After taking, proceed to maintenance.

#### b) Take all cards from the decay pile  
- You may take all cards in the decay pile only if doing so won’t exceed your hand limit.
- If the pile contains a **Basket**, it takes effect immediately (increases hand size).
- If it contains a **Destroying Angel**, apply its hand size reduction.

#### c) Cook 3+ identical mushrooms  
- Must have 3+ of the same mushroom type and an available **Pan** (token or card).
- Play mushrooms and (optionally) a Pan from hand into your play area.
- **Butter**: Can be played with 4+ identical mushrooms; adds +3 MVP.
- **Cider**: Can be played with 5+ identical mushrooms; adds +5 MVP.
- A mushroom counts toward **either** Butter **or** Cider, not both.
- You may cook multiple Butters/Ciders in one turn if conditions are met (e.g., 10 mushrooms can cook 2 Ciders).
- Once cooked, mushrooms are locked in the pan.

#### d) Sell 2+ identical mushrooms  
- Discard 2+ of the same mushroom type.
- Gain foraging sticks equal to their **sell value** (listed on card).
- Only one type may be sold per turn.

#### e) Play 1 pan  
- Play an empty Pan card from your hand into your play area.
- Does not cook mushrooms; prepares for future cooking.

### 2. Maintenance Phase (after main action)  
1. **Move 1 card to decay**:
   - Move the card **closest to the decay** (i.e., first card in forest) into the decay pile.
   - If decay already has **4 cards**, discard all 4 before adding the new one.
2. **Slide forest cards**:
   - Shift remaining forest cards toward the decay to fill the gap.
3. **Refill forest**:
   - Draw from the Day Deck to restore the forest to 8 face-up cards.
   - If the deck is empty, leave fewer cards.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Hand Size**:
  - Base limit: 8 cards.
  - Each **Basket** in play increases limit by +2 (stacks).
  - **Destroying Angel**:
    - When acquired, discard down to **4 + 2 per Basket**.
    - Effect lasts **1 turn per cooked pan of mushrooms**.
    - **Alternative Rule (Official)**: Effect lasts only **one turn**, regardless of cooked sets.
    - You may only have **one** Destroying Angel in play at a time.
- **Night Cards**:
  - Drawn when a Moon is picked.
  - Count as **2 mushrooms** for cooking and selling.
  - Sold alone (2+ sticks) or cooked with just 1 matching mushroom.
  - Count as 2 toward Butter/Cider thresholds.
- **Foraging Sticks**:
  - Gained by selling mushrooms.
  - Used to take cards from deep in the forest.
  - Not part of hand; infinite supply.
- **Cooking Scoring (MVPs)**:
  | Mushroom | Cook | Sell |
  |---|---|---|
  | Morels | 6 | 4 |
  | Honey Fungus | 1 | 2 |
  | Tree Ear | 1 | 2 |
  | Lawyer’s Wig | 2 | 2 |
  | Hen of the Woods | 3 | 1 |
  | Shiitake | 3 | 2 |
  | Porcini | 3 | 3 |
  | Chanterelle | 4 | 2 |
  | Fairy Ring | 3 | 2 |
  - Night versions **double** cooking value (e.g., Night Porcini cooked = 6 MVP each).
- **Butter & Cider Bonuses**:
  - Butter: +3 MVP (when cooking ≥4 of same type).
  - Cider: +5 MVP (when cooking ≥5 of same type).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End**: Triggered **immediately** when the **last card is taken from the forest**.
  - Cards may still remain in decay or hand.
- **Final Scoring**:
  - Sum MVPs from all **cooked mushrooms**.
  - Double MVPs for **Night cards**.
  - Add bonuses for **Butter (+3)** and **Cider (+5)** used.
  - Cards in hand, decay, or uncooked have **no value**.
  - Foraging sticks have **no value**.
- **Win Condition**:
  - Player with **most MVPs** wins.
  - **Tiebreaker**: Number of mushrooms **cooked** (not points).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I take the decay if it contains a Basket but I’m at hand limit?**  
  Yes. The Basket is played immediately, increasing your hand size before the other cards are added.
- **Can I take the decay if it contains a Destroying Angel and I’m at hand limit?**  
  No. The Destroying Angel takes effect **after** you take the cards, so you’d exceed your hand limit temporarily.
- **Can I cook mushrooms while under the effect of a Destroying Angel?**  
  Yes, but only if you have the required number in hand. Cooking **extends** the Destroying Angel’s duration by one turn per pan cooked.
- **Can I have two Destroying Angels?**  
  No. If you pick up a second, it results in an immediate loss (in solo) or is invalid (in base game).
- **Can I sell a Night card by itself?**  
  Yes. It counts as 2 mushrooms, so selling one Night card gives full sell value.
- **Can I cook a Night card with just one matching mushroom?**  
  Yes. Counts as 2 + 1 = 3, meeting the 3-mushroom minimum.
- **What if I can’t take any action?**  
  You **pass** (lose your turn) until you can act. Rare, but legal.
- **Does the game end when the Day Deck is empty?**  
  No. Ends only when the **forest is empty**, even if cards remain in the deck.
