# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The Borg, a cybernetic collective, seek to assimilate all life and technology. In this variant, players command a fleet to explore space, complete missions, and earn Victory Points (VP). The ultimate goal is to achieve a combined VP total of 14 while preventing the Borg from assimilating all homeworlds, occupying all habitable planets, or eliminating all player ships.

## 2. Components
- 9 Borg Ships (scout, small cube, sphere, cube, tactical cube, queen sphere, queen's ship)
- Control Tokens (for Borg influence)
- Unicomplex & Transwarp Conduit markers
- Player fleet ships, command cards, mission cards, location tiles, encounter deck

## 3. Setup
1. Construct a 5x5 grid of face-down location tiles with Command Posts at opposite ends.
2. Place remaining location tiles and encounter deck beside their consoles.
3. Shuffle mission decks (Science, Influence, Combat) and place beside mission console.
4. Determine player fleet size: 14, divided by number of players (rounded up).
5. Draft starting fleet: Shuffle respective fleet deck and draw ships until total size equals fleet size. Discard overshoots; restart if deck exhausts early.
6. Form reinforcement pool with remaining/discard ships.
7. Build command deck: Choose 4 subdecks from 10, shuffle into 40-card deck, draw 4-card starting hand.
8. Draw mission deck: Total mission cards equal to fleet size, based on cumulative SCI/INF/COM values from ships.
9. Draw 3 mission cards (face up, except Secret missions).
10. Place starting ships in Command Post deployment zone.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
1. Players take turns in order.
2. On a player's turn:
   - Move all ships
   - Make power adjustments
   - Play/discard command cards
   - Cycle mission card
   - Take 3 actions
3. After player turn:
   - If a 6 is rolled in any non-combat situation, Borg activates
   - If no Borg on board, place next Borg ship per arrival rules
   - If Borg present, Borg takes its turn immediately
4. Borg Turn:
   - Move using full movement, rolling 2d6 per sector for direction
   - Leave control tokens on entry, end, and every passed sector
   - Trigger combat if in sector with player ship
   - Execute automated action sequence
5. Repeat until victory or defeat condition met.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Borg Behavior
- No card draws
- Upon homeworld assimilation: place 3 tokens, prevent reinforcement, ship cannot leave map
- Borg ship pile: 9 ships in size order (3 to 9)
- Activation: When 6 rolled (non-combat), if no Borg on board, place next ship; if Borg present, end player turn and begin Borg turn

### Movement
- Full movement used each turn
- Per sector: roll 2d6 for direction (per Federation perspective chart)
- Unexplored space: do not reveal, place 2 control tokens, stop movement
- Control Tokens: placed on arrival and turn end (unless player ship present); one left on every passed sector
- Homeworld-bound: if homeworld assimilated, Borg ship cannot leave map; returns to assimilated homeworld when about to exit

### Combat
1. Borg rolls 1d6:
   - Roll = 6: Attempt crew transport (normal rules)
     - Success: assimilate crew, gain crew's bonuses (carry to next ship if destroyed)
     - No crew: target player loses all command cards this turn, then Borg takes 1 combat action
   - Roll ≠ 6: Take 2 combat actions (random target each)
- Ship destruction: discard ship, next in pile enters play

### Reinforcement
- Destroyed ships cannot be reused
- Reinforce per normal rules: select ship from pool without exceeding fleet size
- If fleet size insufficient due to losses, may take next larger ship even if exceeding 14/15 limit
- Fleet size increases by 1 after first ship loss
- No ships left = defeat

### Sabotage
- Beam away team to Borg ship (normal transport rules, crew leader required)
- Success: subtract 2d6 from any system for that turn (reroll at adjustment phase)
- Roll of 6 during sabotage: away team assimilated
- Ship destroyed: 1d6 roll; 6 = beamed to safety, else killed (discard crew)
- Borg ship leaves map: away team assimilated, carried to next Borg ship

### Rescue
- Attempt to rescue/kill assimilated crew (normal transport rules)
- Disassimilate attempt: roll 1d6
  - 4,5,6: successful, regain as normal crew
  - 2,3: crew dies (discard)
  - 1: crew takes control of rescuing ship, becomes Borg ship (all crew assimilated)

### Control & Structures
- 3rd control token in sector: automatically build Unicomplex
- 5th control token in sector: automatically build Transwarp Conduit
- Unicomplex: Cannot be destroyed; sector controlled by Borg permanently
- Transwarp Conduit: When Borg ship destroyed, new ship appears same turn at closest conduit to Federation homeworld, with full movement and action

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### Victory Condition
- Combined VP total of 14 AND no Borg cube present in space

### Defeat Conditions
- Borg assimilates all player homeworlds
- Borg occupies all habitable planets
- Players have no ships left on board and in reinforcement

### Scoring
- VP sources: mission completions, encounter successes, starbase construction, ship destruction
- First starbase: +2 VP
- First enemy ship destroyed: +2 VP
- Subsequent ship destructions: +1 VP
- Starbase upgrade: +1 VP

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Borg Queen Return**: Borg operate beyond 3D constraints; assimilation is not permanent death.
- **Multiple Control Tokens**: Each pass leaves a token; back-and-forth movement accumulates tokens rapidly.
- **Unicomplex & Transwarp Interaction**: Unicomplex enables permanent Borg presence; Transwarp allows immediate replacement after destruction, enabling two consecutive turns.
- **Fleet Size Increase**: Only after first ship loss; allows larger fleet but not infinite reinforcement.
- **Sabotage Carryover**: Away team assimilated if Borg ship leaves map; crew abilities carry to next Borg ship if ship destroyed with assimilated crew.
