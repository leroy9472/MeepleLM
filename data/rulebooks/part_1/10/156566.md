### 1. Lore & Objective
Eons ago, the Old Gods sealed chaos in a sacred urn, beginning the reign of men. The urn was entrusted to the Grand Wizard of Xidiit, but during a celebration for Ragnar Nelfaro, the urn was breached, releasing the Southern Host. This dark force corrupted creatures, turning them against humanity. The House of Nobles sends out Idrakys—noble heirs—to recruit armies, save cities, and restore order.

**Objective**: Become the "Savior of the Kingdom" by proving superior across three endgame assessments: Wealth, Influence with the magical community, and Reputation across the Kingdom.

### 4. Gameplay Flow (per Game Year)
**Phase 1: Secret Orders**
- All players simultaneously program 6 Orders on their Programming Board (one per wheel).
- Order types:
  - Move (choose road color)
  - Action (recruit or eliminate threat)
  - Wait

**Phase 2: Order Resolution**
- Reveal boards.
- Execute first Order of each player clockwise (First Player starts).
- Repeat for Orders 2 through 6.
- Cover executed Orders with Order token.

**Phase 3: City Tile Management**
- When last Unit is recruited:
  - Remove Recruitment tile → discard pile
  - Move Next Recruitment tile to City
  - Refill Next Recruitment from pile
- When threat is eliminated:
  - Remove Threat tile → discard pile
  - Move Next Threat tile to City
  - Refill Next Threat from pile
- Replenish piles if empty:
  - Recruitment pile: flip Threat discard pile → Recruitment side
  - Threat pile: flip Recruitment discard pile → Threat side
- If no tiles available and Threat Queue empty → trigger **Awakening of the Titans**

**Phase 4: Military Census (Years 4, 8, 12)**
- For each Unit type (Militia, Archers, Infantry, Clerics, Battle Mages):
  - Players secretly reveal count
  - Most revealed gets reward:
    - Militia: 1 Gold (value 1)
    - Archers: 2 Gold (value 1)
    - Infantry: place 1 Bard token adjacent to Idrakys
    - Clerics: place 2 Bard tokens (same or adjacent Regions)
    - Battle Mages: add 1 story to own Guild (max 4)
  - Tie: each tied player gets partial reward (1 Gold, 1 Bard, or 1 story)

**Phase 5: End of Game Year**
- Advance Year marker
- Pass First Player token left
- Begin next Game Year

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Movement
- Select road color icon → move Idrakys to adjacent City via that road.
- All moves must be completed.

#### Recruiting Units
- Must be in City with Recruitment tile.
- Must perform Action Order.
- Must take **least powerful** Unit present.
- Only **one Unit per City per Game Year**.
- If no Units left, tile is removed.

#### Eliminating Threats
- Must be in City with Threat tile.
- Must perform Action Order.
- Must have **all required Units** behind Screen.
- Return required Units to Barracks.
- Choose **2 of 3 rewards**:
  - **Gold Sovereigns**: take from Bank (kept secret)
  - **Bard tokens**: place in **adjacent Regions** (or Bastion if central)
    - Cannot choose if out of Bard tokens
  - **Sorcerers' Guild Stories**: place up to number shown next to City
    - Max 4 stories per Guild
    - Only one Guild per City
    - Only one color per Guild
    - Can expand existing Guild

#### Awakening of the Titans
Triggered when:
- Threat pile and Threat Queue are empty
- Cannot replenish Threat pile

**Effects**:
- Flip top Slumbering Titan tile in each pile → Raging Titan
- Trigger **Arrival of Reinforcements**:
  - Flip all Threat discard pile → Recruitment side
  - Add remaining Recruitment pile on top
  - Take top 2 → new Recruitment pile
  - Shuffle rest, flip → Threat pile
  - Top Threat → Next Threat space

#### Eliminating Raging Titans
- Can be done from **any City without tile**
- No specific Units required → pay **1 Unit per icon** (any type)
- Only **one Titan or threat per City per Year**
- Titan removed from game (not discarded)
- Action not mandatory even if Titan available

#### Reputation Scoring (Regions)
- Each Region has lyre symbol with two values (e.g., 3/1)
- After game, reveal Bastion
- Per Region:
  - Most Bard tokens → higher value
  - Second most → lower value
  - Tie for first: both get higher value, no second
  - Tie for second: all tied get lower value

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Game ends after Year 12** (or Year 9 in short game).  
Three **assessments** in random order:

1. **Wealth**: total value of Gold Sovereigns
2. **Influence**: total Sorcerers' Guild Stories on board (not in hand)
3. **Reputation**: sum of points from all Regions (based on Bard token placement)

**Assessment Procedure**:
- Each player places one Score token on Score Track for current category
- Rank players in Hall of Fame (highest to lowest)
- **Tiebreaker**:
  1. Total Units behind Screen
  2. Farthest from First Player (in play order)

**Elimination**:
- **1st Assessment**: last place eliminated (flip token to Eliminated)
  - 5-player: last **two** eliminated
- **2nd Assessment**: lowest active player eliminated
- **3rd Assessment**: lowest active player eliminated
- Last remaining player wins → "Savior of the Kingdom"

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I choose not to recruit if in a Recruitment City?**  
  No — if you perform Action and Units are present, you **must** recruit the weakest.

- **Can I eliminate a threat if I have extra Units?**  
  Yes — only required Units are returned to Barracks.

- **What if I can’t fulfill a Move Order?**  
  You must still move along the selected road color if possible. If no such road exists, the Order fails.

- **Can I place Bard tokens in a Region with an Empty token?**  
  No — in 3-player or short games, Regions with Empty tokens are inactive.

- **Can I build a Guild in a City with no tile?**  
  Only by eliminating a threat in that City first.

- **What happens if I win Battle Mage census but have no Guild?**  
  Keep the story token; place it when you build your first Guild.

- **Can I eliminate a Raging Titan and a regular threat in same turn?**  
  No — only one action per City per Game Year.

- **Do unused Actions give rewards?**  
  No — only successful recruitments or eliminations trigger tile replacement.

- **Can I exchange Gold Sovereigns?**  
  Yes — at any time (e.g., five 1s → one 5).
