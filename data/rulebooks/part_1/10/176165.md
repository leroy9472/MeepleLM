## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Dale of Merchants, players are animalfolk merchants competing to build the most impressive merchant stall and gain entry into the Guild of Extraordinary Traders. The objective is to be the first to complete your merchant stall by building ascending stacks of cards. In solo mode, a player wins by building 8 stacks. In cooperative mode (2 players), the team wins by building 10 stacks. The game is lost if the market is completely emptied by the Company (solo) or Guild (automa), which monopolizes all trade.

2. Components  
- 6 animalfolk decks (15 cards each): Snappy Scarlet Macaws, Dealing Giant Pandas, Thieving Northern Raccoons, Hoarding Flying Squirrels, Lucky Ocelots, Adapting Veiled Chameleons  
- 20 junk cards  
- 1 market board (5 slots)  
- 1 ocelot die (values: 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3)  
- Character cards and trap cards (from Dale of Merchants Collection)  
- Guild action cards, Supplies track, and automa components (for solo/automa mode)  

3. Setup  
- Choose (p + 1) animalfolk decks, where p is the number of players (3 decks for solo, 4 for co-op).  
- Each player forms a 10-card deck: one "1" card from each chosen animalfolk deck + junk cards to fill.  
- Return unused "1" cards to the box. Shuffle remaining animalfolk cards (2–5) to form the market deck.  
- Place 5 market cards face-up on the market board (right to left).  
- Each player draws 5 cards to start.  
- For solo/co-op vs. Company:  
  - Shuffle the opponent’s 10 or 20 cards into a face-up deck (the Company).  
  - Company’s purchasing power starts at 1.  
  - Company’s stalls, deck, and discard are represented by its deck; top card = active card.  
  - Company’s hand = top 5 cards of its deck.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Turns proceed in order: each player takes a full turn, then the Company takes a turn.  
- On a player’s turn:  
  1. Action Phase: Perform one action:  
     a) Market Action: Buy a card from the market by discarding cards from hand (value + slot cost).  
     b) Technique Action: Play a technique card (effects in order). If it has ⊕ (+), take an extra action.  
     c) Stall Action: Build a stack (1–8 or 1–10) using cards from one animalfolk set summing to the required value. Must build in order.  
     d) Inventory Action: Discard any number of cards.  
  2. Clean-up Phase:  
     a) Draw to 5 cards (shuffle discard if needed; use junk if both deck and discard are empty).  
     b) Slide market cards right; refill empty slots from market deck.  
- Company’s Turn:  
  - Purchases 1 (or 2 after first reshuffle) market card(s), starting from the rightmost.  
  - Place purchased cards on top of Company’s deck (counts as building stacks).  
  - After first market reshuffle, Company’s purchasing power increases to 2.  
  - If multiple "throw away" effects occur, only the first is resolved; max 1 card thrown away per turn.  
  - "Discard" = remove permanently; "discard pile" = top of Company’s deck.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Purchasing: Pay using hand cards (face value) and/or gold. Overpayment allowed only if all cards are necessary.  
- Stacks: Built in order (1 to 8 or 10). Each stack must sum exactly to its position number. Must use cards from a single animalfolk set (unless modified by card effects).  
- Deck Management: When deck is empty, shuffle discard to form a new deck. If both deck and discard are empty during clean-up, draw junk cards.  
- Company Interaction:  
  - Targeting Company’s deck, discard, or stalls = interact with top card of its deck.  
  - Company “discards” = throw away permanently.  
  - Company “purchasing” = building a stack.  
- Character & Trap Cards: Optional. Use only characters that don’t interact with opponents. Traps may be included per rules.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Win Condition:  
  - Solo: Build 8 stacks before the market is empty.  
  - Co-op: Build 10 stacks before the market is empty.  
- Loss Condition: Market is completely empty (Company has bought everything).  
- Game ends immediately when a player/team completes their final stack or when the market empties.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can you build a stack out of order?  
  A: No. Must build leftmost, lowest-value stack first (1, then 2, etc.).  
- Q: What happens when the market deck runs out?  
  A: Shuffle market discard to form a new deck. If both are empty, market remains partially filled.  
- Q: Does the Company ever draw cards?  
  A: No. Its deck is static; purchased cards are placed on top.  
- Q: Can the Company use technique cards?  
  A: No. It only purchases cards and builds stacks. Card effects are ignored.  
- Q: What if a card effect tells the Company to discard multiple cards?  
  A: Only the first discard is resolved; the rest are ignored.  
- Q: Can I use a passive card from my hand during another player’s turn?  
  A: Only if the card’s effect allows it and it’s not restricted to your turn.  
- Q: When does the Company’s purchasing power increase?  
  A: After the market deck is first reshuffled (not on a specific turn).
