# Pandemic: Rising Tide — Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In *Pandemic: Rising Tide*, players are Dutch civil officials working cooperatively to protect the Netherlands from rising sea levels and river floods during the Industrial Age. The country’s low-lying terrain makes it vulnerable to water damage, and players must construct modern hydraulic infrastructure to prevent catastrophic flooding.

**Win Condition**: Successfully build all 4 hydraulic structures:
- Afsluitdijk (Purple)
- Deltawerken (Orange)
- Normaliseringswerken (Yellow)
- Ruimte voor de Rivier (Green)

**Lose Conditions**:
- Cannot place required water cubes (supply exhausted)
- Cannot draw 2 Player cards when required (deck empty)

## 2. Components
- 1 Game Board (Netherlands map with regions, dike locations, sea zones)
- 50 Dikes (wooden pieces)
- 36 Water Cubes
- 7 Pawns
- 7 Role Cards
- 5 Pumping Stations
- 5 Ports
- 4 Hydraulic Structure Tokens
- 78 Player Cards:
  - 56 Region Cards (14 per color: Green, Yellow, Orange, Purple)
  - 14 Event Cards
  - 8 Storm Cards (difficulty-dependent)
- 56 Dike Failure Cards (2 per region)
- 1 Sea Level Marker
- 1 Reminder Marker
- 5 Reference Cards
- 12 Objective Cards (for variant play)
- 36 Population Cubes (variant only)
- 1 Population Loss Card (variant only)

## 3. Setup
### Board & Pieces
- Place board centrally.
- Place 1 dike at each red dike location (50 total; two locations start with 2 dikes).
- Place 4 hydraulic structure tokens at designated sites.
- Place 2 water cubes in **Noordzee** and **Zuiderzee** (seas).
- Add initial water cubes:
  - Wieringermeer: 1
  - Markerwaard: 2
  - Fleuveland: 2
  - Noordoostpolder: 2
- Set Sea Level marker to "2" on track.

### Degrade Regions
1. Shuffle Dike Failure deck.
2. Reveal 3 cards → degrade each region **3 times**:
   - Remove 1 dike per degradation if possible.
   - If no dike, add 1 water cube (max 3 per region during setup).
3. Reveal 3 more cards → degrade each **2 times**.
4. Reveal 3 more cards → degrade each **1 time**.
5. Discard all 9 cards face-up to form Dike Failure discard pile.

### Initial Water Flow
After degradation, resolve water flow:
1. For each region with **3 water cubes**, add water to adjacent low-elevation regions (not blocked by dikes or high land) until they have at least **2 cubes**.
2. For each region with **2 water cubes**, add water to adjacent unprotected regions until they have at least **1 cube**.

### Player Setup
- Shuffle Role Cards and deal 1 to each player; give matching pawn.
- All players start in **Delfland**.
- Give each player a Reference Card.
- Return unused Roles, Pawns, and Reference Cards to box.

### Player Deck
- Choose difficulty:
  - Introductory: 6 Storm Cards
  - Standard: 7 Storm Cards
  - Heroic: 8 Storm Cards
- Remove unused Storm Cards.
- Shuffle Event Cards into Region Cards.
- Divide combined deck into as many equal piles as Storm Cards used.
- Shuffle 1 Storm Card into each pile (face-down).
- Stack piles (smallest on bottom) to form Player Deck.
- Place Reminder Marker beside deck.

### Deal Initial Hands
- Deal face-up cards:
  - 2 players: 4 each
  - 3 players: 3 each
  - 4–5 players: 2 each
- Players keep cards face-up.
- First player is the one with the Region Card showing the shortest “Primary Defense Line.”

## 4. Gameplay Flow
On each player’s turn, follow these 5 steps:

### 1. Do 4 Actions
Choose any combination of actions (up to 4):

#### Movement
- **Drive/Ferry**: Move to adjacent region.
- **Sail**: Discard a Region Card to move to that region.
- **Charter Boat**: Discard a card matching your current region to move anywhere.
- **Return to Port**: Move to any region with a port.

#### Construction & Maintenance
- **Pump**: Remove 1 water cube from your region.
- **Build Dike**: If your region has **no water cubes**, place a dike in an adjacent dike location. Multiple dikes allowed per border. If none available, move one from elsewhere.
- **Build Pumping Station**: Discard a matching Region Card to build here. Only 1 per region. If none available, move one.
- **Build Port**: Discard a matching Region Card. Only 1 per region. If none available, move one.

#### Cooperation
- **Share Resources**: Give or take a Region Card matching your current region from another player in the same region. Both must agree.

#### Build Hydraulic Structure
- At a structure site, discard **5 matching-color Region Cards** to build:
  - **Afsluitdijk**: In Wieringermeer or Fryslan
  - **Deltawerken**: In Schouwen-Duiveland
  - **Normaliseringswerken**: In Rijn en IJssel
  - **Ruimte voor de Rivier**: In Roer en Overmaas

### 2. Operate Pumps
For each **pumping station** in a region with ≥1 water cube:
- Remove 1 water cube from **any low-elevation region** connected via water path (through regions with water cubes).
- Path cannot cross seas or dikes.
- Operate in any order.

### 3. Draw 2 Player Cards
- Draw top 2 cards from Player Deck.
- **If fewer than 2 cards remain → immediate loss**.
- **If a Storm Card is drawn**:
  1. **Sea Level Rises**: Move marker up 1. If crossing 2→3 or 3→4, add 1 cube to **both seas**.
  2. **Major Breach**: Draw **bottom card** from Dike Failure deck. Degrade that region **3 times** (remove dikes first, then add water if no dikes). If region already has 3 water cubes and no dikes → trigger **flood**.
  3. **When It Rains, It Pours**: Shuffle Dike Failure discard pile and place on top of draw deck.
- Resolve both Storms if two drawn (in sequence; Events may be played in between).
- Return Storm Cards to box. No replacements drawn.

### Hand Limit
- Maximum hand size: **7 cards**.
- After drawing, if over 7, immediately discard or play Event Cards down to 7.

### 4. Dikes Fail
- Draw **X Dike Failure cards**, where X = current Sea Level.
- For each card:
  - Degrade the region **1 time**:
    - Remove 1 dike if possible.
    - If no dike, add 1 water cube (unless already has 3).
    - If adding a 4th cube would occur → **flood** instead.
- Discard each card to Dike Failure discard pile.

### 5. Water Flows
Resolve in this order:
1. **If seas have 4 water cubes**, add cubes to adjacent unprotected regions until they have **at least 3**.
2. For each region with **3 water cubes**, add cubes to adjacent unprotected low-elevation regions until they have **at least 2**.
3. For each region with **2 water cubes**, add cubes to adjacent unprotected regions until they have **at least 1**.
- Water does **not** flow across dikes or into high-elevation regions.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Degradation
- Removing a dike or adding water due to Dike Failure.
- Priority: Remove dike → if none, add water → if already 3 water, cause flood.

### Floods
- Triggered when a 4th water cube would be added to a region.
- Place 1 water cube in each adjacent unprotected low-elevation region.
- If any of those regions already have 3 water cubes → **chain reaction flood**.
- During chain reaction, do **not** add cubes to regions that already flooded in this step.
- Seas cannot flood.

### Pumping Stations
- Not automatic; activated during **Operate Pumps** step.
- Can remove water from **any connected region** (via water path).
- Cannot cross seas or dikes.

### Event Cards
- Can be played **anytime**, including other players’ turns.
- **Cannot be played between drawing and resolving a card**.
- Not an action.
- Discard to Player discard pile after use.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### Win
- All 4 hydraulic structures are built.

### Lose
- Cannot place required water cubes (supply exhausted).
- Cannot draw 2 Player Cards when required.

Note: Game ends immediately upon meeting win or loss condition.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you build a dike in a region with water?**
  - Only if your role allows it (e.g., Carpenter).
  - Otherwise, must pump first.
- **Can you remove water from seas?**
  - No, unless **Afsluitdijk** is built (then Zuiderzee becomes a region).
- **Can you have more than 3 cubes in a region?**
  - No. Max 3 total (water + population in variant).
- **Do you reshuffle Player discard pile?**
  - No. Game ends if deck is exhausted.
- **Can you move a pumping station/port/dike?**
  - Yes, if none are in supply.
- **Can you play an Event between two Storms?**
  - Yes.
- **Can you use Sailing/Charter from a sea?**
  - Only after Afsluitdijk is built and Zuiderzee becomes a region.
- **Are Delfland and Flevoland adjacent?**
  - No.
- **Is the Afsluitdijk removed by Dike Failure?**
  - No. It is permanent.
