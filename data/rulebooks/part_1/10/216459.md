## THE LOST EXPEDITION — Comprehensive Reference Manual

In *The Lost Expedition*, players lead a team of three explorers through the Amazon jungle in search of the mythical lost city of Z—inspired by Percy Fawcett’s final, ill-fated expedition. The game simulates the real dangers of the Brazilian jungle, including wildlife, disease, terrain, and indigenous tribes.  

**Objective**: Be the first to advance your pawn to the final **Expedition card**, the Lost City of Z. In cooperative and solo modes, this results in a win. In head-to-head, it triggers a win condition depending on tiebreakers.
