## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Mahjong is a tile-based game for four players (can be adapted for 2–5) where the objective is to be the first to form a complete hand of 14 tiles consisting of four sets (either three-tile sequences called Chows, three-of-a-kind called Pongs, or four-of-a-kind called Kongs) and one identical pair (called an eye). The player who completes this hand declares Mahjong and wins the round. The game continues over multiple rounds with scoring based on hand composition and conditions.

### 2. Components  
Each Mahjong set contains 144 tiles (may vary slightly depending on rules), divided into:

- **Three Suits** (36 tiles each, 4 copies of each value):  
  - **Dots** (or Circles): 1–9  
  - **Bamboo** (or Sticks): 1–9  
  - **Characters** (or Cracks): 1–9  

- **Honour Tiles** (28 total):  
  - **Winds** (4 each): East, South, West, North  
  - **Dragons** (4 each): Red, Green, White  

- **Bonus Tiles** (8 total, optional):  
  - **Flowers**: Plum, Orchid, Chrysanthemum, Bamboo  
  - **Seasons**: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter  

Each player also uses a **Personal Wind** (their seat direction), and the game has a **Prevailing Wind** (starting with East). Score tallies or a score sheet are used to track points.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Shuffle Tiles**: Remove Flowers/Seasons if not used. Place all tiles face down and shuffle thoroughly.  
2. **Build the Wall**: Each player builds a wall of 18 tiles (or 17 if excluding Flowers/Seasons), two tiles high, pushed together to form a square.  
3. **Determine Winds**:  
   - Roll dice; highest becomes **East**. Others sit clockwise: South, West, North.  
   - Personal Winds remain fixed for the session.  
4. **Prevailing Wind**: Starts as **East** for first 4 games. After, rotates to South, West, North after dealer loses.  
5. **Choose Dealer**: East rolls a die; count that many walls clockwise. The player whose wall is landed on deals. Dealer keeps position until losing.  
6. **Create Kong Box**: Dealer rolls two dice, counts heaps from right edge of their wall, removes next heap to form the **Kong Box** (source of replacement tiles).  
7. **Deal Tiles**:  
   - Dealer takes first 2 heaps (4 tiles), then each player takes 2 heaps in turn until all have 6 heaps (12 tiles).  
   - Dealer takes 2 more tiles (now 14), others take 1 more (now 13).  
8. **Reveal Bonus Tiles**: Any Flowers or Seasons drawn are revealed and placed face-up in front of the player. They draw a replacement tile from the **Kong Box**.  
9. **Distribute Tallies**: Each player starts with 2,000 points (in tallies or on score sheet).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Starting Play**: Dealer discards one tile to begin.  
2. **Turn Order**: Play proceeds **counter-clockwise** (to the right). Each player must:  
   - Pick up one tile (from wall or discard pile)  
   - Discard one tile  
   - Always maintain 13 tiles in hand (excluding revealed Flowers/Seasons).  
3. **Drawing from Wall (Most Common)**:  
   - Player draws the next tile from the wall.  
   - May keep it or discard immediately.  
   - Sets made from wall draws can remain **concealed** (score higher).  
4. **Claiming Discarded Tiles**:  
   - **Chow** (sequence): May only claim the discard from the player **immediately to the left**, and only on your turn. Must meld immediately.  
   - **Pong** (triplet): Can claim any player’s discard to complete a Pong. Interrupts play; skipped players lose turn.  
   - **Kong** (quadruplet): Can claim any discard to complete a Kong. Must meld and draw a **replacement tile** from the Kong Box.  
   - **Mahjong (Out)**: Can claim any discard or draw from wall to complete winning hand. Ends game immediately.  
5. **Priority for Claims**:  
   - **Mahjong > Kong > Pong > Chow**  
   - Only one player can act per discard.  
6. **Kong Rules**:  
   - When completing a Kong (via discard or draw), player takes **one replacement tile** from Kong Box.  
   - If drawing the 4th tile to complete a concealed Kong, player must **reveal the set**, turning outer two tiles face-down to indicate concealment.  
7. **End of Round**: Game ends when:  
   - A player declares Mahjong (immediately), or  
   - Wall is exhausted (no winner).  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Sets**:  
  - **Chow**: 3 consecutive tiles of the same suit (e.g., 4-5-6 Dots). Only from left discard or self-draw.  
  - **Pong**: 3 identical tiles. Can be melded or concealed.  
  - **Kong**: 4 identical tiles. Counts as one set. Requires replacement tile.  
- **Bonus Tiles**:  
  - Flowers/Seasons are set aside and replaced from Kong Box.  
  - Score points if match Personal Wind or form full set.  
- **Concealed vs Melded**:  
  - Concealed sets (not revealed) score higher.  
  - Any set completed via discard must be melded (shown).  
- **Winning Conditions**:  
  - Must have four sets + one pair.  
  - Winning tile may come from wall (self-drawn) or discard.  
  - Hand must meet minimum scoring requirements (if applicable).
