## Crown of Emara — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Crown of Emara is a strategic board game set in a medieval kingdom where players act as aspiring nobles vying to earn the favor of the crown. Over six rounds, players manage resources, recruit advisors, grow their population, and construct buildings to build a balanced and prosperous realm.

**Objective:**  
At the end of the game, your final score is the **lower** of your Citizen score or Building score. The player with the highest such score wins. A balanced kingdom—neither too many citizens without homes nor too many buildings without people—is key to victory.
