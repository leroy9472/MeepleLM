## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Celestia*, players are adventurers traveling aboard a fragile aircraft through a mystical sky world to reach distant celestial cities. Inspired by Gulliver’s journeys, players brave storms, pirates, birds, and clouds to collect valuable treasure cards. The goal is to amass the most treasure points. The first player to reach 50 points—immediately before a new journey begins—wins. In case of a tie, the player with the fewest treasure cards wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each journey consists of multiple legs. Each leg follows this sequence:

#### 1. Captain Rolls the Dice  
- The Captain rolls as many dice as shown on the next City tile.  
- Each die shows one of four hazards: Clouds, Thunder, Damok-bird, Cannon, or blank.  
- The Captain does **not** play cards yet.

#### 2. Passengers Choose to Stay or Disembark  
- Starting with the player to the Captain’s left, each Passenger declares:  
  - “I will stay” → remains aboard  
  - “I will leave” → removes pawn, draws top Treasure card from current city  
- The Captain **cannot** disembark at this stage unless alone later.  
- After all decisions:  
  - **Ejection** card may be played (forces another passenger to leave)  
  - **Rowboat** may be chosen (see Expansion below)

#### 3. Captain Declares Success or Failure  
- The Captain evaluates their hand:  
  - Must play required Equipment cards if available (mandatory)  
  - Turbo cards are optional  
- The Captain announces:  
  - “I can overcome the challenges” → proceed to card play  
  - “I cannot overcome the challenges” → aircraft will crash  

#### 4. Special Cards May Be Played  
After the Captain's declaration, the following cards may be played:

| Card | When | Effect |
|------|------|--------|
| **Wind Gust** | After declaration, before card play | Captain must re-roll all blank dice |
| **Alternate Route** | If Captain declared failure | Captain may re-roll any number of dice |
| **Jet Pack** | If Captain declared failure | Player disembarks safely and takes a treasure from the farthest city reached |
| **Magic Spyglass** | If Captain declared failure | Aircraft automatically advances to next city with no card cost |
| **Helping Hand (A Little Help)** | After crash announcement | Passengers play face-down cards to assist; each helps with one hazard type |

> Note: All Helping Hand cards are discarded after use, even if unused. Unused ones count as -2 points each at game end.

#### 5. Captain Plays Cards or Crash  
- If Captain declared success:  
  - Plays required Equipment or Turbo cards (one per hazard die)  
  - Upgraded Equipment counts as two of same type  
  - Must play Equipment if available; Turbo is optional  
- If successful:  
  - Aircraft moves to next city  
  - All played cards discarded  
- If unsuccessful or blocked:  
  - Aircraft **crashes**  
  - No treasure collected by remaining players  
  - Aircraft returns to first city  
  - All players draw one Equipment card  
  - New journey begins

#### 6. Change Captain  
- The player to the left of the current Captain becomes the new Captain  
- If a player has reached 50 points before this new journey begins, the game ends

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Equipment Cards  
Each hazard requires a specific card:  
- Clouds → Compass  
- Thunder → Lightning Arrester  
- Damok-bird → Foghorn  
- Cannon → Cannon  

Multiple dice of same type require multiple cards (or one Upgraded Equipment + one regular).  
Blank dice require no cards.

#### Special Cards  
| Card | Who | When | Effect |
|------|-----|------|--------|
| **Ejection** | Captain or Passenger | After disembark decisions, before card play | Force another passenger to leave and take treasure |
| **Wind Gust** | Any player | After Captain's declaration | Captain must re-roll all blank dice |
| **Alternate Route** | Captain or Passenger | After crash declared | Captain may re-roll any dice |
| **Jet Pack** | Captain or Passenger | After crash declared | Player leaves safely, takes treasure from farthest city |
| **Magic Spyglass** | Captain or Passenger | After crash declared | Aircraft proceeds to next city automatically |
| **Mooring Line** | Any player | After Captain plays cards | Aircraft does not move; stays in same city |
| **Bandit** | Any player | Before dice roll | Captain must roll one extra die |
| **Grappling Hook** | Passenger who just left | After journey continues | Discard treasure, rejoin aircraft |
| **Desperate Need** | Captain | Before playing cards | Choose another player to become Captain; then decide to stay or leave |
| **New Equipment** | Any player | Before dice roll | Discard hand, draw same number of cards |
| **Spy** | Any player | Before dice roll | Look at any other player’s hand |
| **A Little Help** | Passengers only | After crash declared | Play face-down to assist; each card helps with one hazard type |
| **Rowboat** | Captain or Passenger | During disembark phase | Leave in rowboat instead of aircraft; travel independently |

#### Rowboat Rules (Expansion)  
- A player may choose to enter the rowboat instead of disembarking or staying.  
- Only one player per rowboat; first opportunity goes to player left of Captain.  
- Rowboat moves **after** aircraft each leg.  
- Rowboater rolls dice and uses their own cards to overcome hazards.  
- Rowboat card provides immunity to one hazard type (e.g., Clouds).  
- If rowboater fails, they are out of journey with no treasure.  
- Journey ends only when both aircraft and rowboat have crashed or finished.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends **immediately before a new journey begins** if any player has **50 or more points**.  
- Players total the values on their Treasure cards.  
- **Magic Spyglass**: Worth 2 points if unused.  
- **A Little Help**: Each unused card in hand = **-2 points**.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with **fewest treasure cards** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can the Captain disembark if alone?**  
  Yes—only if they are alone in the aircraft upon reaching a city. They may then choose to leave and take treasure.

- **What if the Captain can only succeed with Turbo cards?**  
  Captain may **choose** not to play them. If they don’t, they must declare failure.

- **What if a city runs out of treasure?**  
  Remove or flip the city tile. It is no longer a stop. No one may disembark there.

- **What happens at the final city (25)?**  
  All aboard disembark in clockwise order starting with Captain, each taking one treasure if available. Then a new journey begins.

- **What if the card deck runs out?**  
  Shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

- **Can the Captain use Desperate Need to pass role and then leave?**  
  Yes. After transferring Captaincy, the former Captain may choose to stay or leave.

- **Can players discuss?**  
  Yes! Negotiation and bluffing are encouraged.
