## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the land of Astoria during the Gilded Age, players compete as tycoons striving to dominate the commodity market, build towns, and control railroads. The objective is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the game through strategic production, selling, auctions, building purchases, and town acquisitions. The player with the highest VP total wins; ties are broken by remaining cash.

2. Components  
- Game Board: Features Commodity Market tracks, spaces for Railroad cards, Town cards, and Building tiles.  
- 6 Commodity Types (30 each): Wheat, Wood, Iron, Manufactured Goods, Coal, Luxuries.  
- Money: Denominations of $1, $5, $10, $20, $100.  
- 54 Price & Production Cards.  
- 24 Railroad Cards (varies by player count).  
- 16 Town Cards.

3. Setup  
- Shuffle the Price & Production deck; deal 3 cards to each player. Place the rest as a draw deck.  
- Set starting commodity prices: Place one token each on $1 (Wheat, Wood), $2 (Iron, Coal), $3 (Goods, Luxuries).  
- Give each player $10.

  - 2 Players: Remove Skunkworks, Sly Fox, Tycoon.  
  - 3 Players: Remove Skunkworks, Tycoon.  
  - 4 Players: Remove Skunkworks.  
  - 5 Players: Use all.  
  Shuffle and place face-down; flip 2 face-up.  
- Create the Town Deck: Order by VP—2VP on top, then 3VP, 4VP, 5VP. Flip top card.  
  - 2 Players: Remove one random Town card of each VP value.  
- Building Tiles: Shuffle 6 Basic Commodity Bonus Tiles (+1 side up); randomly place 4 face-up. Shuffle remaining Advanced Building Tiles into a stack to refill spaces.  
- Choose a starting player; they receive the Start Player Token and 1 free commodity.  
- Each player gains additional starting commodities based on turn order: 2nd player gets 2, 3rd gets 3, etc., all of different types.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise. On a turn, a player performs exactly one of five actions:  
  1. **Production**  
  2. **Sell a Commodity**  
  3. **Start a Railroad Auction**  
  4. **Purchase a Building**  
  5. **Purchase a Town**  
- After resolving the action, the player draws back to 3 Price & Production cards if applicable.  
- The round ends when all players have taken a turn. A new round begins with the next player clockwise.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Production**:  
  - Play a Price & Production card.  
  - Take up to 3 commodities shown in the Production area (fewer if limited by buildings).  
  - Increase prices of commodities shown in the Price area by $1 per icon.  
  - Commodity Bonus (B) Buildings: Gain +1 or +2 of matching commodity; only one B building may be used per turn.  
  - Production (P) Buildings (Cottage Industry, Factory): Increase max commodities taken to 4 or 5. Only one P building may be used per turn.  
  - Discard played card and draw a new one.  

- **Sell a Commodity**:  
  - Sell any number of one commodity type.  
  - Receive cash equal to current market price × units sold.  
  - Decrease that commodity’s price by number of units sold.  

- **Railroad Auction**:  
  - Select one of the two face-up Railroad cards.  
  - Minimum bid is shown on the card.  
  - Bidding starts with auctioneer; proceeds clockwise. Players may bid higher or pass.  
  - Winner pays bid and takes the card.  
  - If auctioneer does not win, they take another action.  
  - Replace the card with one from the deck.  
  - Two-player variant: Auctioneer may only bid once.  

- **Purchase a Building**:  
  - Pay the cost of any of the 4 face-up Building tiles.  
  - Take the tile; gain its ongoing benefit.  
  - Each building increases commodity storage limit by 1 (Warehouse increases by 4).  
  - Refill the space from the stack.  
  - Upgrade Option: Pay cost on back of double-sided tile to flip it (e.g., +1 to +2). Only one flip allowed.  

- **Purchase a Town**:  
  - Pay either:  
    - Specific commodity amount shown on left, or  
    - Any combination of commodities totaling the number on the right.  
  - Take the Town card.  
  - Replace with next from deck.  

- **Storage & Hand Limits**:  
  - Base commodity limit: 10. Increased by 1 per building owned (+4 if Warehouse).  
  - Base hand limit: 3 Price & Production cards. Increased by Smuggler (+1) or Black Market (+2).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Game Trigger**: When two of the following occur:  
  - Last Town Card is purchased.  
  - Last Railroad Card is auctioned.  
  - Last Building Tile is purchased.  
- Finish the current round (all players take a turn). Game ends after the last player’s turn.  

- **Scoring**:  
  - Town Cards: VP shown on card.  
  - Railroad Cards: Score VP based on set completion:  
    - 1 card: first number  
    - 2 cards: second number (total, not per card)  
    - 3 cards: third number  
    - 4 cards: fourth number  
  - Buildings: 1 VP each, plus any VP from special abilities (e.g., Mayor's Office, Bank).  
  - Town + Railroad Pair: 2 VP per pair (match one Town to one Railroad card, not set).  
  - Mission Cards (optional): Reveal and score as specified.  
- **Victory**: Highest VP wins. Tiebreaker: Most cash.

  No. Must sell at least one.  
- **Can I bid more than I have?**  
  No. Bids cannot exceed current cash.  
- **What happens if all players pass in an auction?**
