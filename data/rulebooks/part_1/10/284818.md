## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Caylus 1303*, players take on the role of master builders competing to gain the most Prestige Points (PP) by supplying the construction of the Castle of Caylus. The game spans 9 rounds, during which players develop the city, activate buildings, deliver resources, and construct monuments. The player with the highest PP at the end of the game wins.

In the solo variant "Anne," designed by dusk2dawn, the player competes against an automa (AI opponent) named Anne. The automa simulates a human opponent in a two-player game, with actions driven by a deck of 7 decision cards. The goal is to score more PP than Anne.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of four phases:  
1. **Planning Phase:** Players and automa take turns placing workers or passing.  
2. **Activation Phase:** Buildings are activated in order from City Gate up to the Provost.  
3. **Delivery Phase:** Players with workers at the Construction Site deliver bundles.  
4. **Stewardship Phase:** Residences are flipped, monuments built, workers recruited, Provost moved, round advances.  

Anne acts first in each Planning Phase. Her turn is resolved using the top card of the automa deck.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Automa Action Execution  
- Reveal top automa card.  
- Follow prioritized actions top to bottom.  
- Execute only one action per card.  
- If no action is possible, discard and draw a replacement.  

#### Action Priorities & Tie-Breaking  
- When multiple buildings satisfy a desired effect (e.g., "gain wood"):  
  1. Prefer building offering the most of the desired resource/effect (including bonuses).  
  2. If tied, prefer building closest to the City Gate.  

#### Out-of-Reach Buildings  
- Anne cannot place a worker on a building more than 3 spaces from the Provost.  
- This limit is **not** extended by Toll or Bailiff ability.  

#### Special Actions  

**Construction:**  
- Anne prioritizes Stone over Wood buildings.  
- Take top tile from appropriate stack (Stone or Wood).  
- Place on first available Road space.  
- Gain PP and place a House.  
- **Limits:** Max 3 Wood buildings, max 3 Stone buildings.  

**Lawyer:**  
- When Anne activates Lawyer, place a House on the starter building closest to the City Gate.  
- **Limit:** Can use Lawyer up to 3 times in the game.  

**Favor:**  
- Anne gains favors as per normal game rules.  
- Effects:  
  - Rounds 1–3: Benefit from random starter building (Anne gains nothing; no resource collection).  
  - Rounds 4–6: Gain 4 PP from Tailor.  
  - Rounds 7–9: Gain 4 PP from Church.  
- Then, take leftmost available character from the board (if any).  
- Anne does **not** steal characters from the player.  

**Delivery:**  
- Anne uses the Delivery automa card.  
- Place worker on Construction Site queue.  
- Deliver bundles as follows:  
  - Rounds 1–3: 1 bundle  
  - Rounds 4–6: 1 bundle  
  - Rounds 7–9: 2 bundles  
- Each bundle = 5 PP.  
- Anne **does not** need resources to deliver.  
- If Anne wins delivery contest, gain a Favor (as above).  

**Toll & Guilds Bridge:**  
- **Toll:** Move Provost up to 2 spaces so that the furthest building occupied by Anne is just before or at Provost. Move even if all buildings are already activatable.  
- **Guilds Bridge:** Move Provost up to 3 spaces (4 if Anne has Bailiff). Same strategy as Toll.  

**Monuments (Rounds 7–9):**  
- Anne builds one monument per round.  
- Take top monument tile and place on Anne’s residence closest to the City Gate.  
- Gain PP shown on monument.  
- **No bonus resources** from monument effect are gained.  

**Passing:**  
- When automa deck is empty, Anne passes.  
- Place Anne’s House on first available Guilds Bridge space.  
- Player incurs additional worker penalty if placing workers after Anne passes.  
- If player passes but Anne has cards left, Anne continues playing without penalty (like Night Worker).
