## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are a giant monster rampaging through New York City, battling other colossal creatures, destroying buildings, and gaining fame. The goal is to become **King of New York** by either:  
- Earning **20 Victory Points (★)**, or  
- Being the **last Monster standing**.  

The game ends at the end of any turn when one of these conditions is met. If all Monsters are eliminated in the same turn, no one wins.

#### 2. Resolve the Dice  
Resolve all dice of one type before moving to another. Order is player’s choice.

|-------|--------|
| **♥ (Heal)** | Heal 1♥ per die. Cannot heal in Manhattan unless via cards. Max 10♥. |
| **♦ (Energy)** | Gain 1 Energy cube per die. |
| **⚔ (Attack)** | Deal 1 damage per die:  
  - In Manhattan → All Monsters **outside** Manhattan take damage.  
  - Outside Manhattan → All Monsters **in** Manhattan take damage.  
  - If you deal at least 1 damage, you are "attacking." |
| **🡺 (Destruction)** | Destroy Buildings/Units in your borough. Each die = 1 Durability damage.  
  - Must destroy if possible; may choose suboptimal targets.  
  - Destroyed Building → Flip to Unit side, place in borough, reveal next Building.  
  - Destroyed Unit → Place in front of you. Cannot destroy newly revealed Unit on same turn. |
| **★ (Celebrity)** | If you roll **3 or more**, take the **Superstar** card. Gain 1★ +1★ per ★ beyond the third.  
  - While holding Superstar, gain 1★ per ★ rolled.  
  - Lost if another player rolls 3+ ★. |
| **💀 (Ouch!)** | Triggers military response:  
  - 1: Units in your borough attack **you** (1 damage per Unit).  
  - 2: Units in your borough attack **all Monsters in your borough** (1 damage per Unit).  
  - 3+: All Units in **all boroughs** attack (each Monster takes 1 damage per Unit in their borough).  
  - Also, take the **Statue of Liberty** card: gain +3★ until lost. Lose it if another player rolls 3+ 💀. |

#### 3. Move

> - Must enter if any track is open.  
> - On advancement, stay on same track (2-4 → 2-4, 5-6 → 5-6).  
> - If number of Monsters drops below 5, the 5-6 track is deactivated; Monster there must flee.

#### 4. Buy Cards  
- Buy any face-up card by paying its Energy cost.  
- Or pay **2♦** to discard all 3 face-up cards and replace them.  
- May buy and/or refresh in any order, multiple times.
