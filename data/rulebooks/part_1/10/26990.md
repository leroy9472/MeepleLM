### 1. Lore & Objective
Container is a 3–5 player economic strategy game where players build and operate a supply-and-demand system. The primary goal is to produce containers, sell them to other players, ship them to a foreign island, and profit from their secret end-game value. Players must balance production, trade, and shipping to maximize income while avoiding oversupply.

### 2. Components
- 5 Player Boards
- 1 Foreign Island Board

1. **Determine Starting Player**: Randomly chosen.
2. **Turn Order**: Clockwise.
3. **Per Turn**:
   - **Pre-Turn Actions**:
     1. Pay $1 interest per outstanding loan.
     2. (Optional) Beginner Variant: Sell one container from Factory or Harbor Store for $2.
   - **Main Actions**: Perform two of the following (one action may be repeated, except Produce):
     - **Buy Warehouse or Machine**: Pay cost shown on next available space.
     - **Buy Containers from Another Player’s Factory Store**: Pay listed price; containers go to your Harbor Store.

     - **Move Ship**:
       - To another player’s harbor: Optionally buy containers (goes to your Ship).
       - To Foreign Island: Trigger auction for all containers on your Ship.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Production**:
  - Each machine produces one container of its color per turn.
  - Factory Store capacity: 2 containers per machine.
  - Production is mandatory if supply allows; player chooses which to produce if capacity is exceeded.
- **Storage & Capacity**:
  - Harbor Store capacity: 1 container per warehouse.
  - Ship capacity: 5 containers.
- **Trading**:
  - Cannot buy your own containers.
  - Buying from a player’s Factory Store: Any number, but limited by Harbor capacity. Costs one action per selling player.
  - Buying from a player’s Harbor Store: Only when your Ship is docked; containers go to your Ship.
- **Shipping & Auction**:
  - When a Ship reaches the Foreign Island, an auction is held:
    - All other players submit blind bids for the entire cargo.
    - Ties: Tied players bid again; if still tied, seller chooses.
    - Seller may:
      - **Accept** the highest bid: Receive bid amount + matching government subsidy from bank.
      - **Decline**: Pay the highest bid to the bank and keep the cargo for own island area.
  - Auction ends the player’s turn immediately.
- **Loans**:
  - Take a $10 loan (Loan Document) at any time.
  - Max 2 loans per player.
  - Pay $1 interest per loan at the start of each turn.
  - Repay any time during your turn (after interest).
  - **Default**:
    - Unpaid interest: Bank seizes:
      1. 1 container from Foreign Island per loan.
      2. If none: 2 containers from Harbor Store.
      3. If not enough: 1 container per deficit from Factory Store.
      4. If no containers: 1 warehouse or machine (excluding “–” and $4/$6 spaces).
    - The player to the right of the delinquent player chooses what is seized.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **End Game Trigger**: When any two container colors are exhausted from the supply.
  - The triggering player finishes their turn; then the game ends.
- **Final Scoring**:
  1. **Discard Most Abundant Color**: Each player discards all containers of the color they have the most of.
     - Tie: Player chooses, **except** if the two-value color is tied for most, it **must** be discarded.
  2. **Score Remaining Containers**:
     - Use secret Value of Containers Card.
     - For the special two-value color: $10/container if at least one of each color is present; otherwise $5.
     - Other colors: Fixed $ value per card.
  3. **Bonus for Remaining Storage**:
     - $2 per container in Harbor Store.
     - $3 per container on Ship.
  4. **Debt**: Pay $11 per outstanding loan (principal + $1 interest).
  5. **Total**: Cash on hand + scored containers + bonuses – loan repayments.
- **Winning**: Highest total wins. Tiebreaker: Most containers on Foreign Island. If still tied, players share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I buy from multiple players in one action?** No. Each purchase from a different player costs one action.
- **Can I reorganize my stores without buying?** Yes. Reorganizing containers in your Factory or Harbor Store is a free part of the respective “buy” or “produce” actions.
- **What happens if I can't pay interest and have no assets?** You avoid paying the interest for that turn only.
- **Can I produce zero containers?** No. You must produce up to your capacity if containers are available.
- **Does declining an auction cost an action?** No. The auction and decision happen as part of the “Move Ship” action and end your turn.
- **House Rule (Recommended)**: Use 9/12/15 containers per color for 3/4/5 players for a shorter, more balanced game.
