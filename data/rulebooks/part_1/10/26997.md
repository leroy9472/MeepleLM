## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In 1989: Dawn of Freedom, players reenact the revolutions that swept Eastern Europe at the end of the Cold War. The Communist player attempts to maintain control through repression and reform, while the Democrat player leads protests and civil resistance to topple Communist regimes. Victory is achieved by earning the most Victory Points (VPs) through controlling countries, scoring during Power Struggles, and final scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Control
A space is controlled if:
Controller’s SPs – Opponent’s SPs ≥ Stability Number

#### Card Play
- **Events**: May be played for Event instead of Ops. Cards with * are removed if Event occurs.
- **Opponent’s Event**: If playing opponent’s card for Ops, Event occurs (opponent implements). Phasing player chooses whether Event occurs before or after Ops.
- **Scoring Cards**: Must be played the turn drawn. Cannot be held.

#### Operations
When playing a card for Ops, choose one option:

**Support Point Placement**:
- SPs placed one at a time.
- Must be placed with or adjacent to friendly SPs present at start of placement.
- Cost: 1 Ops in friendly/uncontrolled space; 2 Ops in opponent-controlled space.
- Cost may change during placement if control shifts.

**Support Checks**:
- Each Ops card grants two Support Checks.
- Target space must contain opponent SPs.
- Resolution: Roll 1D6 + Ops value + modifiers.
  - +1 per adjacent friendly controlled space
  - –1 per adjacent opponent controlled space
- Success if total > (2 × Stability Number).
- Remove opponent SPs equal to difference. If insufficient, add own SPs.

**Tiananmen Square Attempt**:
- One attempt per turn.
- Roll 1D6 + Ops value + modifiers:
  - +1 if own Event
  - +1 if second or later attempt for same space
  - +1 if Communist and Li Peng in play
- Success if total ≥ printed value in own color.
- Event not triggered; card discarded.

#### Tiananmen Square Track
Advancing and reaching a space before opponent grants benefits:
- **Reformer Memorialized/Discredited**: +1 to future Tiananmen rolls
- **Students Rally/Students Dispersed**: Play 1-Ops cards as 2-Ops
- **Foreign News/People's Daily**: Draw 3 cards, keep 1, discard 2
- **Hunger Strike/Students Arrested**: Remove 2 opponent SPs
- **Goddess of Democracy/Structure Removed**: Discard non-Scoring card and draw replacement at start of each turn
- **Local PLA Support/Rural Divisions Summoned**: Free 2-Ops Support Check at end of turn
- **Square Barricaded/Protestors Massacre**: Play one card per turn for Ops without triggering opponent’s Event
- **Political Pluralism/Most Favored Nation**: Play one card per turn for both Ops and Event

#### Power Struggles
Triggered when a Scoring card is played.

1. **Deal Cards**:
   - 6 cards for first controlled space
   - 2 cards for each additional space
   - Adjusted by Events (e.g., Roundtable Talks, National Salvation Front)

2. **Raise the Stakes** (optional):
   - Discard 3 cards to add +1 to VP and Support Loss die rolls
   - +2 if both players raise

3. **Card Play**:
   - Attacker (player who played Scoring card) starts.
   - Play a suited card (Petition, March, Strike, Rally in the Square), leader card (if controlling matching space type), or wild card.
   - Defender must match suit or use leader/wild.
   - Defender rolls to seize initiative: must roll ≥ attacker’s card rank.
   - Rally in the Square: automatic counterattack (no roll needed).
   - Wild cards skip response and attacker role swaps.

4. **Aftermath**:
   - **Support Loss**: Loser rolls die, applies modifiers, consults table for SPs to remove.
     - Modifiers: +2 if won by Rally, –2 if won by Petition, +1 per player who raised stakes, +1 if Yakovlev in play and Dem won
   - **Victory Points**: Winner rolls die, applies modifiers, consults table for VPs.
     - If Democrat wins and modified roll ≥4, Communist loses Power in country.
     - Communist may voluntarily surrender Power.
   - **Scoring**: Score country per 9.3.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### Victory Conditions
1. **Automatic Victory**: Reach +20 or –20 VPs (except during Final Scoring).
2. **Illegal Held Card**: Player with Scoring card at end of turn loses.
3. **New Year's Eve Party**: Communist may end game; Democrat may conduct one final Power Struggle.
4. **Final Scoring** (after Turn 10):
   - Score all countries.
   - Communist scores –4 VPs per country still in Power.
   - Add Country Scoring for each country.
   - Highest total wins.

#### Country Scoring
- **Presence**: Control ≥1 space → score Presence VP
- **Domination**: Control more spaces, more battleground spaces, and at least one non-battleground space → score Domination VP
- **Control**: Control more spaces and all battleground spaces → score Control VP
- Score highest level achieved.
- +1 VP per controlled battleground space.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Minimum Ops**: Non-Scoring cards always have minimum 1 Ops.
- **Event Modifiers**: Apply in aggregate (e.g., Prudence, Sinatra Doctrine).
- **Holding Cards**: Only non-Scoring cards may be held; Scoring cards cause loss.
- **Romanian Events**:
  - *The Crowd Turns Against Ceausescu*: Sits in front of Democrat until Romania Scoring; triggers after card deal.
  - *The Tyrant is Gone*: Sits until Romania Scoring; when resolved, Democrat chooses escape space; if captured, +2 VPs; if not, Communist –2 VPs.
- **Power Struggle Deck**: 52 cards: 36 suited (Petition x6, March x12, Strike x12, Rally x6), 12 leaders, 4 wilds.
- **Reshuffling**: Discard pile reshuffled when draw deck empty. *-marked cards not included.
