## Reef Encounter — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Reef Encounter is a strategic tile-placement and area-control game set in a vibrant coral reef ecosystem. Players take on the role of competing coral species striving to dominate the reef. The objective is to grow large corals, consume rival corals, manipulate coral strength dynamics, and ultimately score the most points by feeding corals to your parrotfish.

The final score depends on both the number of coral tiles eaten and their strength relative to other coral colors at game end. Victory comes not just from size, but from controlling the balance of power in the reef.

### 2. Components  
- **Polyp Tiles** (5 colors: white, yellow, orange, pink, grey) – Represent individual coral units; used to build corals on the reef.
- **Larva Cubes** (5 colors) – Required to place polyp tiles; match the color of tiles played.
- **Shrimps** – Mark ownership and protect corals; each player has a limited supply.
- **Parrotfish** (player containers) – Store tiles scored during the game; scoring occurs when corals are “eaten.”
- **Coral Strength Tiles (CSTs)** – 10 double-sided tiles on the open sea board showing strength relationships between coral colors (stronger vs. weaker).
- **Algae Cylinders** (4 colors: red, green, blue, purple) – Used to flip CSTs and lock their orientation.
- **Open Sea Board** – Secondary board holding CSTs and refill lots.
- **Main Reef Boards** – Multiple rocky tiles forming the play area; include starfish bonus spots and deep water zones (impassable).
- **Starfish Symbols** – Grant bonus polyp tiles when adjacent tiles are placed.

### 3. Setup  
1. Assemble the main reef boards into the playing area.  
2. Place the 10 Coral Strength Tiles randomly on the open sea board; ensure all are face-up and visible.  
3. Place one algae cylinder on the designated small circle of the open sea board (used for flipping).  
4. Shuffle remaining algae cylinders and place them nearby.  
5. Each player receives:
   - A parrotfish container
   - 2 shrimps
   - Initial supply: 1 larva cube and 1 polyp tile of each color (behind screen)
6. Fill the 5 refill zones on the open sea board with:
   - 1 larva cube
   - 3–4 polyp tiles (varied colors)
7. Determine starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, perform any number of actions in any order **except** eating, which must occur first if done. End your turn by refilling from one of the five zones.

#### Turn Order:
1. **Optional: Feed Parrotfish** (Action 1) – Must be first.
2. **Any combination of other actions**, in any order:
   - Grow corals (Actions 2 & 3)
   - Place or move shrimps (Actions 4 & 5)
   - Exchange tiles/cubes (Actions 6 & 8)
   - Use algae cylinder to flip or lock CSTs (Action 7)
3. **Refill** – Choose one of five zones to take its cube and tiles (Action 10).

You may skip all actions except refill.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action 1: Feed Your Parrotfish  
- **When:** Must be the **first action** of your turn.
- **Requirements:**
  - Coral must be at least 5 tiles large.
  - One of your shrimps must be on it.
- **Effect:**
  - Remove entire coral from board.
  - Return 4 tiles to supply.
  - Place remaining tiles into your parrotfish.
  - Shrimp is removed:
    - If **first feeding**, place shrimp on open sea board (unlocks ability to lock CSTs).
    - Subsequent feedings: shrimp is eaten (removed from game).
- **Limit:** Maximum 4 feedings per player.

#### Actions 2 & 3: Grow Corals (up to two times per turn)  
- Spend 1 larva cube (return to supply).
- Play up to 4 polyp tiles of matching color from **behind** your screen.
- Or play **unlimited** tiles from **in front** of your screen (consumed tiles).
- Place tiles orthogonally adjacent to form or extend corals.
- Cannot place in deep water (dark areas).
- **Bonus:** Adjacent to starfish? Draw 1 bonus tile of same color from supply.
- **Merging Rule:** Cannot merge two shrimped corals of the same color.
- **Consumption (Overgrowth):**
  - If your coral is ≥2 tiles and adjacent to a weaker coral (per CSTs) of unprotected tiles (not under shrimp protection), you may replace one such tile with your color.
  - Removed tile goes **in front of your screen** (consumed).
  - Only one tile may be consumed per placement action.
  - Shrimp protection extends to its tile and 4 orthogonally adjacent tiles.

#### Action 4: Introduce a New Shrimp  
- Place one of your shrimps on any unshrimped coral (yours or unclaimed).
- Only one shrimp per coral.
- Maximum 2 shrimps on the board at once per player.

#### Action 5: Move or Remove Shrimps  
- Move any of your shrimps to any valid tile.
- Can temporarily place on bare rock (not deep water).
- Must be on a coral at end of turn.
- Can remove shrimp (returns to supply); must use Action 4 to redeploy.

#### Action 6: Exchange Polyp Tile for Larva Cube  
- Spend 1 consumed tile (from in front of screen).
- Take 1 matching-color larva cube **and play it immediately** (official rule update: no hoarding).
- Cube goes behind screen only after being used.

#### Action 7: Exchange Polyp Tile for Algae Cylinder  
- Spend 1 consumed tile (from in front of screen).
- Take 1 algae cylinder of any color.
- **Must use immediately.**
- Two options:
  - **Flip CSTs:** Place cylinder on central spot → all CSTs with large algae of that color flip.
  - **Lock CST:** If you’ve fed at least once, place cylinder directly on a CST showing matching large alga → that tile is locked; others of that color flip.
- Only **one lock per turn**, but unlimited flips.
- Cylinder remains on board (either central spot or locked tile).

#### Action 8: Exchange Larva Cube for Polyp Tile  
- Spend 1 larva cube (from behind screen).
- Take 1 polyp tile of same color; place behind screen.
- Unlimited uses.

#### Action 9: Do Nothing  
- Perform no actions except refill.
- Still must refill (Action 10).

#### Action 10: Refill  
- Choose one of five refill zones.
- Take all polyp tiles and the larva cube; place behind screen.
- Refill the zone from supply (same composition as setup).
- Always the **last action** of your turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Triggers (game ends immediately when any one occurs):  
1. **All 10 Coral Strength Tiles are locked.**  
2. **One player feeds their 4th coral to their parrotfish.**  
3. **No legal move possible:** No player can place a tile (no valid larva/tile combo or space).

#### Final Feeding:  
- Players who did **not** trigger the end may feed **one final coral** (if able), losing **5 tiles** instead of 4.

#### Scoring:  
For each color in your parrotfish:
- Base value: **1 point per tile**.
- Plus **1 point for each coral color it is stronger than** (based on final CST orientation).
- So each tile is worth **1 to 5 points**.
- Total score = Σ (tile count × value per tile) across all colors.

**Example:** Pink is stronger than Yellow and Grey → each pink tile = 1 + 2 = **3 points**.

Highest score wins. Tie: fewest uneaten tiles wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I consume my own coral?** Yes, if it's unprotected and adjacent to a stronger, ≥2-tile coral of yours.
- **Can I place tiles on a coral guarded by opponent’s shrimp?** Yes, as long as not consuming protected tiles.
- **Can I grow a coral of a color I don’t have a larva cube for?** Only using consumed tiles from in front of screen.
- **What happens to a CST when locked?** It cannot be flipped again. Cylinder remains on it.
- **Can I lock multiple CSTs in one game?** Yes, but only one per turn, and only after first feeding.
- **Do locked CSTs still trigger flips?** No. Only unlocked CSTs with matching algae flip.
- **Can I move a shrimp onto a tile I just consumed?** Yes, if it's now part of your coral.
- **Can I feed a coral I just grew this turn?** Yes, if it meets size and shrimp requirements.
