### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Sticheln* (also known as *Stick 'Em*), players aim to maximize their point total over multiple rounds by skillfully avoiding cards of their self-chosen "Pain Color" (also called "Misery Color"). Each card matching this color counts negatively, equal to its face value. All other cards count as +1 point each. The player with the highest total score after all rounds wins.

### 2. Components
- 120 cards in six colors (red, yellow, green, blue, purple/violet, brown/gray), numbered 0–18 depending on variant.
- Rulebook.

### 3. Setup
- **Deck Composition by Player Count**:
  - 3 players: 0–8 in red, yellow, green, blue, purple (45 cards)
  - 4 players: 0–11 in red, yellow, green, blue, purple (60 cards)
  - 5 players: 0–14 in red, yellow, green, blue, purple (75 cards)
  - 6 players: 0–14 in red, yellow, green, blue, purple, gray (90 cards)
  - 7 players: 0–17 in six colors
  - 8 players: 0–18 in six colors
- Shuffle the appropriate deck and deal 15 cards to each player (14 cards each if 8 players).
- Any undealt cards (3 with 7 players, 2 with 8) are revealed and set aside.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Choose Pain Color**: Each player secretly selects one card from their hand and places it face down. All reveal simultaneously. The color of this card is their Pain Color for the round.
2. **Play Tricks**:
   - The youngest player leads the first trick.
   - In clockwise order, each player plays one card to the center.
   - No requirement to follow suit.
   - After all play one card, determine the trick winner.
   - Winner collects the trick and leads the next.
   - Repeat until all cards are played (14 tricks for 3–7 players, 13 with 8 players).
3. **Scoring**: Each player calculates their score for the round.
4. **Next Round**: Reshuffle all cards (including set-aside), deal anew. The player to the left of the previous dealer leads the first trick.

The game consists of a number of rounds equal to the number of players (e.g., 4 rounds with 4 players).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Lead Color**: The color of the first card played in a trick.
- **Trump**: Any card not of the lead color is a trump card (except 0).
- **0 Card Rule**: The 0 card is neutral and cannot win a trick.
- **Determining Trick Winner**:
  - If all cards are of the lead color, the highest number wins.
  - If any non-lead color card (trump) is played, the highest-numbered trump wins.
  - If multiple highest-value trumps are played, the first one played wins.
  - If all cards are 0, the player who led the first 0 wins the trick.
- **Special Case**: If all players play 0, no one wins; cards are discarded, and the same player leads again.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Per Round**:
  - Each card (including the revealed Pain Color card) matching a player’s Pain Color: subtract points equal to its number.
  - All other cards: +1 point each.
  - Total score = (positive cards) – (sum of Pain Color card values).
- **End Game**:
  - Play a number of rounds equal to the number of players.
  - Sum all round scores.
  - The player with the highest total wins.
  - If all scores are negative, the player with the least negative score wins.
  - Ties are possible.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can multiple players have the same Pain Color?**  
  Yes. Players may choose the same color.
- **Does the Pain Color card count toward scoring?**  
  Yes. It counts as a negative point card equal to its number.
- **Can a 0 win a trick?**  
  No. A 0 is neutral and cannot win, unless all cards in the trick are 0 — then the first 0 played wins.
- **What happens if a player cannot avoid winning Pain Color cards?**  
  They must accept the negative points. Strategy involves minimizing high-value Pain Color cards won.
- **Who deals in subsequent rounds?**  
  Any player may shuffle and deal. The player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick.
