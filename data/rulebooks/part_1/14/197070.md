## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Massive Darkness is a cooperative dungeon-crawling board game where players take on the roles of Heroes battling against the forces of darkness. The objective varies per quest but generally involves completing specific objectives such as defeating key enemies, retrieving artifacts, or escaping the dungeon. The team wins or loses together based on whether the quest objectives are met.

### 2. Components
- Hero miniatures and character sheets
- Enemy miniatures (Mobs, Agents, Bosses, Roaming Monsters)
- Dice (Yellow, Red, Blue, Green)
- Tokens (Wound, Level, Lightbringer, Door, Exit, Treasure, etc.)
- Cards (Event, Door, Treasure, Enemy)
- Game board tiles and zone markers
- Equipment and Skill cards

### 3. Setup
- Assemble dungeon tiles based on quest or random generation rules.
- Place Hero Starting Zone in a corridor on the first tile, furthest from the second.
- Set Level tokens on corridor zones: one per tile for dungeons ≤5 tiles; for larger dungeons, place Level 1 on first tile, Level 5 on last, and interpolate.
- Place Exit token on the final tile, as far from start as possible.
- Set Lifebringer with Wound tokens based on player count:
  - 1–2 players: 0 tokens
  - 3–4 players: 1 token
  - 5–6 players: 2 tokens
- Shuffle Event, Door, Enemy, and Treasure decks.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Action Phase**  
   Heroes activate in initiative order (1–6). Each Hero has 3 Action Points (AP) to spend on:
   - Movement (1 AP → 2 Movement Points)
   - Combat (1 AP)
   - Reorganize/Trade (1 AP)
   - Use Signature (0 AP, costs 1 XP)
   - Transmute (0 AP, requires 3 Equipment)
   - Disengage (1 AP): Move from Enemy zone after taking an immediate attack.
   - Focus (1 AP): Gain +1 to next Attack or Defense.
   - Assist (1 AP): Grant +1 to next Ally action.
   - Get Up (1 AP): Recover from Stunned.

2. **Enemy Phase**  
   Enemies activate by initiative. Each follows:
   - Step 1: Attack nearest valid target if in range.
   - Step 2: Move 1 zone toward target.
   - Step 3: Attack again if possible.
   - Step 4: Move 1 zone toward target.
   - Target Priority: In-range Hero with most XP → Line of Sight → Light Zone → Starting Zone.

3. **Experience Phase**  
   - Heroes may:
     - Transmute at Power Node Zones.
     - Spend XP to learn Skills.
     - Reorganize Inventory.

4. **Event Phase**  
   - First Player draws and resolves one Event Card.
   - Resurrect fallen Heroes using Lifebringer tokens.
   - Trade initiative order with other players.

5. **End Phase**  
   - Pass First Player token clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Combat**:  
  - Attack: Roll dice based on weapon (Melee: Range 0; Ranged/Magic: LoS, Range 1+).  
  - Defense: Defender rolls Defense dice.  
  - Hits: Wounds dealt = Hits - Shields.  
  - Bams/Diamonds: Trigger special effects (e.g., extra wounds, counter-damage).  
  - Counter-Attack: After a Hero attacks, surviving Enemies counter-attack immediately.

- **Shadow Mode**:  
  - Heroes in Shadow Zones (no light) gain access to Shadow Mode Skills.  
  - Enemies ignore Heroes in Shadow Zones unless attacked or in LoS.

- **Line of Sight**:  
  - Straight lines parallel to board edges; blocked by walls, closed doors, or board edges.  
  - No diagonal LoS.

- **Stunned**:  
  - Miniature laid on side; cannot act.  
  - Hero spends 1 AP to recover.  
  - Enemy uses full activation to recover.

- **Knocked Down**:  
  - Hero at 0 Health: lay miniature down, Health set to 1, add Wound token.  
  - Cannot act, ignored by Enemies unless no other targets.  
  - Dies if still down after one activation.  
  - Wound token removed only in Town Phase.

- **Enemy Types**:
  - **Minions**: Basic enemies; defeated for 1 XP.
  - **Boss**: Leads Mobs; 3 XP when defeated; only targetable after Minions are dead (unless Mob is Stunned).
  - **Agent**: Spawns Minions; 4 XP; only moves when provoked.
  - **Roaming Monster**: Unique enemies; 5 XP; spawn via quest rules.
  - **Mob**: Group of Minions + Boss; spawn with Treasure.

- **Mob Activation Rules**:
  - Ranged/Magic Enemies:
    1. Attack and move 1 away.
    2. Move 1 toward target.
    3. Attack and move 1 away.
    4. Move 1 toward target.

- **Dice Limits**:  
  - Max 3 dice per color. Excess:
    - Yellow → +1 Hit
    - Blue → +1 Shield
    - Red → +1 Hit or Bam (if usable)
    - Green → +1 Shield or Diamond (if usable)
