### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Parliament Rounds (PR)
- Players bid to start a company via auction.
- Turn order: Priority Deal starts; proceeds clockwise.
- Auctions:
  - Player selects an IPO company with available home station.
  - Bids in multiples of £5, starting at £0.
  - Must have ≥ £162 + bid amount.
  - Winner pays bid to bank, starts company.
- Starting a Chartered Company:
  - Choose par price (54–100).
  - Pay 3 × par for director’s share.
  - May buy up to 2 additional shares.
  - Company floats when 50% of shares are owned.
  - Treasury = 10 × par – £180 station fee.
  - Receives 3 station markers (£60 each).
- **Obligation:** Company must float by end of next Stock Round or pay fine (5 × par).

#### Stock Rounds (SR)
- Turn order: Priority Deal starts, then clockwise.
- Actions (in order):
  1. **Sell Shares:** Any number, as a block per company.
     - Price: Stock market value (½ if trainless, rounded down).
     - Stock price drops 1 space per share sold (zigzag), unless:
       - Company not yet floated
       - Stock price > 200 or < 40 (ignore 1st non-director share sold)
       - Stock price > 400 (ignore 1st and 2nd non-director shares sold)
       - After LNER formation
     - Cannot sell shares bought in same SR.
  2. **Buy or Start Shares:**
     - Buy 1 share per turn from:
       - IPO: Pay par (chartered)
       - Bank Pool: Pay stock price
       - Company: Pay stock price (to treasury)
     - Start Non-Chartered Company:
       - Buy director’s share from IPO.
       - Set stock price (54–200).
       - Pay 3 × stock price to company treasury.
       - Par = highest ≤ stock price.
       - Choose 2–7 station markers (£40 each).
       - Company floats when 50% owned (incremental capitalization).
- **Certificate Limit:** Based on player count:
  - 2: 25 | 3: 18 | 4: 13 | 5: 11 | 6: 10 | 7: 9 | 8: 8
  - After LNER forms: limit = highest number of shares held by any player.
- **End of SR:** Pass consecutively. Priority Deal passes to first passer.

#### Operating Rounds (OR)
- Turn order: Descending stock price; ties broken by top token in stack.
- Actions in order:
  1. **Merge (Start of Turn):** With another company by mutual consent.
     - Requires uninterrupted route between stations.
     - Shares merge 2:1.
     - New stock price = lower + ½ higher (round down).
     - If either company trainless, use ½ its price.
     - Surviving company continues if neither has operated.
  2. **Track Action (One Only):**
     - Lay 2 yellow non-N tiles
     - Lay 1 yellow N tile
     - Upgrade yellow → green
     - Upgrade green → russet
     - Place 1 small station
     - Build rail link to London (counts as track + station action)
  3. **Place 1 Station:** In open city on company route.
  4. **Run Trains:**
     - Must run all trains for which company has permits.
     - One run must include home station.
     - Additional runs must intersect at a large station.
     - Each train’s route must be continuous, no reuse of own track.
     - Cannot run port-to-port or red-to-red.
     - Each station/area scored only once per company.
     - **Freight:** Score start/end stations; +£20 per intervening hex (+£30 if port involved). Non-permanent freight must connect end-to-end.
     - **Express:** Score all large stations and off-board areas visited.
     - **Local:** Score all large and small stations (small = £20). +£10 per hex to treasury (not revenue).
     - N/M trains: Visit M stations, score N; choose which not to score.
  5. **Revenue:**
     - Director decides to pay dividends or retain.
     - Stock price movement:
       - No dividend: ←1
       - Dividend < stock price: no move
       - Dividend ≥ stock price: →1
       - Dividend ≥ 2× stock price: →2, up to →4
     - **George Hudson Manoeuvre:** If revenue ≥ £10 and < stock price, may use treasury funds (in £10 increments) to raise revenue to ≥ stock price. Must then pay dividend.
  6. **Buy Trains:**
     - From bank or other companies.
     - Cost: face value until next phase train sold; then ½ price.
     - Limits:
       - A–D: 3 per type
       - E–F: 2 per type
       - G–H: 3 total trains
     - May buy 1–3 warranties (£50 each, max 3 per train).
     - A/D trains come with 1 free warranty.
     - Warrantied trains do not rust.
  7. **Redeem Share:** Company buys 1 of its shares from bank pool at stock price.
  8. **Acquire (End of Turn):** Buy out another company.
     - Same as merger but surviving company does not operate further this OR.

#### Mergers & Refinancing (2:1 Share Merge)
- **Triggered by:** Merger, Acquisition, Refinancing.
- **Procedure:**
  1. Move IPO shares to bank pool.
  2. Calculate new stock price.
  3. Shareholders return ½ shares (rounded down); non-surviving first.
  4. Swap non-surviving shares 1:1 with surviving shares (bank first, then other shareholders).
  5. Sell unredeemable shares to bank at stock price (½ price if option).
  6. Redeem or relinquish option shares (½ stock price).
- **Assets Transfer:** Trains, treasury, permits, stations (up to 7).
- **Director:** Largest shareholder (≥3 shares); else receivership.

#### Receivership
- Triggered when director’s share is in bank pool.
- Company:
  - Cannot build track or place stations.
  - Runs trains for max revenue.
  - Retains revenue.
  - Buys 1 train from bank if affordable.
  - Bankrupt if trainless and cannot buy.

#### Bankruptcy
- Triggered by:
  - No train and cannot afford one (after refinancing).
  - Stock price drops to bankrupt space.
- Consequences:
  - Director’s share returns to IPO with original permit.
  - Trains, stations, treasury removed.
  - Shareholders compensated: ½ stock price (rounded down) if trainless; full price otherwise.
  - Shares go to bank pool.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **End Triggers:**
  1. **LNER Formation:** After first H train purchase, complete current OR set. Then:
     - No more PRs.
     - No new companies.
     - No mergers/acquisitions.
     - No track/station building.
     - Trains only from bank.
     - Share sales no longer affect price.
     - Certificate limit changes.
     - Perform 1 SR and 3 ORs (nationalization), then game ends.
  2. **Stock Market:** Any company reaches £340 → end after current OR.
  3. **Bank Break:** Bank runs out of money → end after current OR set.
- **Winner:** Highest personal wealth (cash + share value). Company treasuries do not count.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Home Station Placement:** On first OR, company may displace most recently placed rival station if no space.
- **Small Stations:** Do not block freight or express routes. Placed on green/russet tiles only.
- **London:** Up to 4 companies may have a token. Cannot trace routes through London.
- **Train Limits:** Excess trains not discarded. Cannot buy if at or above limit.
- **Phase Changes:** Triggered by first train purchase of new type. Rusts occur immediately.
- **Forced Train Purchase:**
  - Sell shares (at full price) or refinance (2:1 merge, gain 10× par).
  - Cannot combine methods.
  - After action, buy from bank.
