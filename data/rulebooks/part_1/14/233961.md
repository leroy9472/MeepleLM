## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The King has died under mysterious circumstances, leaving no heir. Five factions of the realm now vie for control. Players compete to win the support of at least three of the five factions by recruiting followers and gathering influence over two phases of play. The player who wins the majority of followers in at least three factions claims the throne and wins the game.

2. Components  
- 52 cards across 5 factions:  
  - 14 Goblins (0–9, five 0s)  
  - 10 Dwarves (0–9)  
  - 10 Undead (0–9)  
  - 10 Doppelgangers (0–9)  
  - 8 Knights (2–9, values 0–9 with two 0s and two 2s)  
- 2 overview cards  
- Additional faction cards (from expansions):  
  - Shadow cards (20 total, numbered 0–19)  
  - Moon card (Full/No Moon sides)  
  - TOXIC cards (3)  
  - POTION cards  
  - FIRE PHOENIX cards  
  - Red reveal strip (for hidden-value cards)  

3. Setup  
- Shuffle all base faction cards (Goblins, Dwarves, Undead, Doppelgangers, Knights) into a face-down deck.  
- Deal 13 cards to each player.  
- The youngest player leads the first trick.  
- Place the deck in the center.  
- For Shadows: Shuffle all 20 Shadow cards and randomly remove 10 (or 8 for a 12-card non-duo game).  
- For Poisoners: Reveal 3 TOXIC cards face-up at setup.  
- Place the Moon card on “No Moon” side.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of two phases:  

**Phase One: Recruit Followers (13 tricks)**  
Each trick proceeds as:  
1. Reveal: Flip the top card of the deck to the center.  
2. Play:  
   - Leader plays any card.  
   - Second player must follow suit (same faction) if able, unless playing a Doppelganger.  
3. Collect:  
   - Highest-value card of the leader’s faction wins. Tie → leader wins.  
   - Winner takes the center card into their Follower deck (face-down).  
   - Loser takes the top card of the deck into their Follower deck (may look, but keep hidden).  
   - If an Undead card is played, the winner adds it to their Score pile (face-up).  
   - Discard all played cards.  

**Phase Two: Gather Supporters (13 tricks)**  
- Players use their 13 Follower cards as their hand.  
- Each trick:  
  1. Play:  
     - Leader plays any card.  
     - Second player must follow suit if able.  
  2. Collect:  
     - Winner takes both played cards into their Score pile (face-up), unless modified by faction ability (e.g., Dwarves).  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Following Suit**: Must play same faction as leader if able.  
- **Doppelganger**: Can be played instead of following suit. Counts as same faction but does not copy abilities.  
- **Faction Powers (Selected Key Abilities)**:  
  - **Dwarves (Phase Two)**: Loser of trick collects all Dwarves played; winner collects non-Dwarves.  
  - **Dragons**: Player who plays the last Dragon leads the next trick.  
  - **Trolls**: Only one Troll may be added to score pile per trick. Remaining Trolls stay in center for future winners. Unclaimed Trolls discarded at end of Phase 2.  
  - **Seers (Phase One)**: Winner may peek at top deck card and choose it instead of center card.  
  - **Werewolves**: Moon alternates when a Werewolf wins. No Moon → lowest Werewolf wins; Full Moon → highest wins.  
  - **Vampires**: Can tuck non-Vampire cards under to add +1 each. Highest total value wins faction.  
  - **Zombies**: Winner takes all losing cards into score pile. Zombie card is discarded.  
  - **Ghosts**: May keep Ghost instead of winning card; discard the won card.  
  - **Awakener**: After Phase 1, discard pile becomes new deck. Winning with Awakener → draw random card from new deck into score pile.  
  - **Sun/Star Monks**: Must alternate factions when following suit (Sun → Star → Sun, etc.).  
  - **Sandworms**: Trick played face-down; abilities ignored until reveal.  
  - **Scorpions**: Adding Scorpion to score → draw random card from STUNG pile; modifies next played card.  
  - **Prophets**: If led, winner determined by total RUNEs in all score piles: ≤3 → lowest Prophet wins; ≥4 → highest wins.  
  - **Tinkerers (4+)**: “Explode” — discarded, but other won cards kept.  
  - **Valkyries**: If value is 3+ higher than led card, treated as that faction (no power copy).  
  - **Lightning Elementals**: Discard X from score to add +X to played card’s value.  
  - **Eagles**: Cannot lead two tricks in a row (unless only Eagles left).  
  - **Bearkin**: Win trick → place top deck card on bottom, draw new one (not final trick of Phase 1).  
  - **Peasants & Royals**: End game — Peasant stays only if Royal of same or up to 3 higher value exists. 0 Peasant always flees.  
  - **Racoons**: At end, LOOT-symbol Racoons count toward lowest card faction control.  
  - **Bards**: Longest sequence of consecutive values wins. Tie → normal scoring.  
  - **Griffons**: Keep face-up; future same-number cards get +5.  
  - **Automations**: Win trick → automatically win next trick (after reward, all discard, winner claims and leads).  
  - **Vikings**: Each Viking with matching number card counts as two for scoring.  
  - **Bugmen**: Must have another Bugman within ±2 value, or pass to left.  
  - **Ice Kings & Queens**: Matching number pairs “marry” and are removed from scoring.  
  - **Frostbeasts**: Discard all other won cards; only score Frostbeast.  
  - **Yetis**: Winner does not lead next trick. Highest non-Yeti leads. If all Yetis, loser leads.  
  - **Demons & Fire Elementals**: Value hidden (Odd/Even or High/Low) until all played; use red strip to reveal.  
  - **Tricksters**: At end, reveal real (✓) vs. fake (X) cards with red strip; remove fake.  
  - **Poisoners**: At end, remove all score pile cards matching any TOXIC value.  
  - **Minotaurs**: If led and winner, others return played cards to hand.  
  - **Satyrs**: If face-up spoil is Satyr, highest number wins (overrides other abilities).  
  - **Cyclops**: Fewest Cyclops wins (must have at least one). Tie → lowest value breaks.  
  - **Druids**: Lose trick → keep Druid as “Bear” for +3 on next play, then discard.  
  - **Unicorns**: Keep face-up; each adds -1 to all future non-Unicorn cards played.  
  - **Elves & Orcs**: No abilities. Duo cards: choose faction when played.  
  - **Wizards**: Win trick → gain random face-down POTION. Later, flip to modify a card’s value.  
  - **Shapeshifters**: Swap with reward card when played. If leads, treat as that faction.  
  - **Mermaids**: Keep face-up; each subtracts -1 from future played cards.  
  - **Phoenixes**: Lose with Phoenix → draw FIRE PHOENIX into hand (plays as normal Phoenix, no draw on loss).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After Phase Two, score each faction:  
  - Most cards in Score pile wins the faction.  
  - Tie → highest single card wins.  
- Player who wins at least three factions wins the game.  
- Special End Game Scoring:  
  - Peasants & Royals, Bugmen, Ice Kings & Queens, Vikings, Bards, Racoons, Cyclops, Tricksters, Poisoners: apply special rules before final count.
