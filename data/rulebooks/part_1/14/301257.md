## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the near future, magnetic levitation rail offers a clean, fast, and efficient public transit renaissance. Players are rail tycoons competing to build the most effective metro system across futuristic city maps. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) by strategically building track, delivering passengers, unlocking capabilities, and fulfilling Bonus VP cards. The game ends when all four commuter station types (Office, Store, Embassy, Studio) are built and the passenger bag is empty—after one final round. The player with the most VPs wins; ties are broken by fewest robots on the player board.

2. Components  
- 4 Player Boards  
- 4 Trains (one per player)  
- 18 Track Tiles per player (72 total: green, orange, yellow, blue)  
- 104 Passenger Tokens:  
  - 54 Robot Workers (18 steel, 18 gold, 18 copper)  
  - 50 Commuters (14 pink, 14 lilac, 11 coral, 11 purple)  
- 14 Station Tiles:  
  - 2 Factories, 2 Warehouses, 2 Labs, 2 Offices, 2 Stores, 2 Embassies, 2 Studios  
- 1 Hub Tile (Manhattan and certain maps only)  
- 1 Cloth Bag  
- 1 Scorepad  
- 1 Start Player Token  
- 4 Decks of 52 Bonus VP Cards (208 total)  
- Map-specific components (e.g., Strike Schedule, Moonbase stations, Mechs, VIPs, etc., depending on map variant)

3. Setup  
- Choose a map (e.g., Berlin, Manhattan, London, etc.). Setup varies slightly per map.
- Place the map in the center.
- Randomly place 3 starting stations (Factory, Warehouse, Lab) in designated hexes:
  - Berlin: Schillingstraße, Märkisches Museum, Jannowitzbrücke
- Place robots on starting stations per player count:
  - 2 players: 1 copper on Factory, 1 gold on Warehouse, 1 steel on Lab  
  - 3 players: +1 copper on Factory, +1 copper +1 steel on Warehouse, +1 gold +1 steel on Lab  
  - 4 players: +2 copper +1 steel on Factory, +2 gold +1 steel on Warehouse, +1 copper on Lab
- Place 1 matching passenger on each starting station.
- Place remaining robots in the cloth bag.
- Each player:
  - Selects a color and takes matching train, player board, 18 track tiles, and 1 Bonus VP card from each of the 4 decks.
  - Takes 1 robot of each type (steel, gold, copper); Player 4 takes an additional robot of choice.
  - Places train:
    - Berlin: On any starting station (take 1 robot from that station)
    - Manhattan: On the Hub
- (Optional) Draft Bonus VP cards: Each player takes one deck, drafts one card, passes the rest left, repeats until all have one of each type.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise, starting with the Start Player.
- On your turn, take 2 or more actions in any order (minimum 2; up to 5 with Extra Actions).
- Actions include: Track (build/remove), Move, Pick Up, Drop Off, Refill Station, Adjust, Build Station, Reverse Train.
- After actions, check for game end: if all four commuter station types exist and the bag is empty, finish the current round, play one more full round, then end the game.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Player Board**: Defines capabilities. Robots placed in specific sections grant units for actions.
  - **Units per Action**: Determines how many units you have for each action. First column is free.
  - **Extra Actions**: Each filled row grants an additional action per turn (max 3 extra).
  - **Capacity**: Max passengers train can carry.
  - **Unlock Passengers & Build Stations**: Fill columns to unlock ability to pick up, drop off, or build stations of that color.
- **Track Building**:
  - Cost: 1 unit per land hex, 2 units per river hex.
  - Must build from end of your line (or from Hub in Manhattan).
  - Only 2 track connections allowed per station per player.
  - Track may overlap other players’ tiles; curved tiles are functionally identical regardless of size.
- **Train Movement**:
  - 1 unit of MOVE = move to next station.
  - Train must stay on own track; cannot traverse incomplete links.
  - Can reverse at end of line automatically, or use REVERSE TRAIN action mid-line.
- **Passenger Handling**:
  - Pick Up: Load passengers at current station (robots always allowed; commuters only if unlocked).
  - Drop Off: Unload passengers matching current station color (or Hub, which counts as Factory, Warehouse, Lab).
  - Refill Station: Draw passengers from bag and place on current station (set aside matching colors and redraw).
- **Build Station**:
  - Requires 1 unit in BUILD STATION and unlocked column for that color (except Factory/Warehouse/Lab).
  - Place in recessed hex connected to your track.
  - Station comes with a passenger (place on your board); robots on hex go to station (matching color go back to bag).
  - First station of a new color: add all commuters of that color to the bag.
- **Adjust**: Move robots on your player board (1 unit per robot). Does not affect commuters.
- **Bonus VP Cards**: Scored at game end. Max 15 VPs per card. Score highest card, plus one additional per filled row in BONUS VP CARDS section.

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Trigger**: After a player’s turn, if:
- All four commuter station types (Office, Store, Embassy, Studio) are on the map
- Passenger bag is empty  
→ Finish current round, then play one final round. Then score.

**Scoring**:
- **Passengers**:
  - Pink & Lilac: 1 VP each
  - Coral & Purple: 2 VPs each
  - +1 VP per passenger if their column is filled in PASSENGER & LINK VPs
- **Links**:
  - 1 VP per completed track link (connection between two stations)
  - +1 VP per link for each filled row in PASSENGER & LINK VPs
- **Bonus VP Cards**:
  - Score highest card (max 15 VPs)
  - +1 additional Bonus VP card per filled row in BONUS VP CARDS section (each max 15 VPs)
- **Player Board Bonuses** (examples):
  - 4 VPs per filled row in Extra Actions
  - 5 VPs per empty row in Extra Actions
  - 3 VPs per filled column in Passenger & Links VPs (passenger color)
  - 4 VPs per empty column in Passenger & Links VPs
  - 4 VPs per filled row in Passenger & Links VPs (link rows)
  - 5 VPs per empty row in Passenger & Links VPs
  - 3 VPs per filled row in Units per Action
  - 3 VPs per empty row in Units per Action
  - 3 VPs per filled column in Unlock Passengers & Build Stations
  - 15 VPs if both pink and lilac columns are empty in Unlock Passengers & Build Stations
  - 5 VPs per filled row in Bonus VP Cards section
- **Track Bonuses** (examples):
  - 3 VPs per straight/curved tile on river hex (must be part of completed link)
  - 2 VPs per straight/curved tile in supply
  - 1 VP per tile overlapping others (completed link)
  - 1 VP per tile not overlapping others (completed link)
  - 3 VPs per tile in longest link between stations
  - 1 VP per tile not in completed link
  - 2 VPs per curved tile directly connected to station (completed link)
  - 2 VPs per tile not directly connected to station (completed link)
  - 1 VP per tile connected to two stations (only one tile in link)
  - 2 VPs per station your track does not connect to
- **Direct Connection Cards**: 1 VP per direct link between two specific stations (Hub counts as Factory, Warehouse, Lab; max 15 VPs per card)
- **Passenger Cards**: VPs for having/missing certain passengers (max 15 VPs per card)

**Winning**:  
Highest total VPs wins. Tiebreaker: fewest robots on player board. If still tied, play again.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build track through a recessed hex without a station?** No.
- **Can I have more than two track connections to a station?** No. Max two per player.
- **Can I build multiple tracks from the Hub?** Yes (Manhattan only), but each must go to a different station.
- **Does overlapping tiles require track intersection?** No. Tile overlap is sufficient.
- **Can I score a station for "2/STATION YOUR TRACK IS NOT CONNECTED TO" if it hasn’t been placed?** No. Only count placed stations.
- **Do passenger movements on player board take effect immediately?** Benefits (e.g., extra actions) take effect immediately; unit changes apply on next action.
- **Can I pick up passengers at a station I haven’t unlocked?** Yes, but only robots or unlocked commuter colors.
- **Can I drop off at the Hub?** Yes. Hub counts as Factory, Warehouse, and Lab.
- **What happens if I exceed Capacity?** Remove excess passengers to current station; if color matches, return to bag.
- **Can I build a loop?** Yes. You may remove any tile to break loop and build from new ends.
