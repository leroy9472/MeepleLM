### 3. Setup  
1. **Build the Island**: Assemble the 10 island pieces around the central circular tile to form a 10-sided island (La Isla).  
2. **Place Animal Tiles**: Randomly place 35 Small Animal Tiles (7 of each animal) onto the dark green jungle regions. Remove 1 extra tile of each animal from the game (do not use).  
3. **Prepare Scoring Track**: Place one Purple Marker at the bottom (space 0) of each animal’s scoring track on the board.  
4. **Player Setup**: Each player receives:  
   - 6 Explorers in their color  
   - 1 Cardholder  
   - 1 random Large Animal Tile (counts as 2 of that animal)  
   - 1 Resource Cube of each color (5 total)  
   - Place 1 Explorer on the 0/50 space of the shared VP track  
   - Place remaining 5 Explorers below slot C on their Cardholder  
5. **General Supply**: Place unused Explorers and Resources in a general supply next to the board.  
6. **Cards**: Shuffle the 180 cards and create multiple face-down draw piles.  
7. **Starting Player**: Choose a start player; they receive the Starting Player Card.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of two phases: **Card Phase** followed by **Action Phases A → B → C → D**.

#### Card Phase  
- All players draw 3 cards from the draw piles.  
- Each player places one card face-down under each of slots A, B, and D on their cardholder.

#### Action Phase A (Simultaneous)  
- Reveal the card under A and place it into one of the three top slots on the cardholder.  
- Only the top card in each slot is active.  
- Cannot place a card that duplicates an identical card already in another active slot.  
- The action on the top half of the card becomes available immediately and remains active until replaced.

#### Action Phase B (Simultaneous)  
- Reveal and discard the card under B.  
- Take the resource shown in the bottom-left corner of the card from the supply.  
- Some cards grant bonus effects if the received resource matches a specified type.

#### Action Phase C (Player Order)  
Starting with the current first player and proceeding clockwise:  
- **Option 1**: Place or move 1 Explorer  
  - If you have an Explorer in your personal supply, place it on any jungle space.  
  - Otherwise, move one of your existing Explorers from another space.  
  - Pay 2 Resources matching the color of the terrain where placing/moving.  
    - Exception: Some card effects reduce this cost to 1.  
  - Multiple Explorers may occupy the same space, but no more than one per player.  
- **Option 2**: Instead of placing/moving, take 1 Resource of any color from the supply.  

**Surrounding & Scoring Tiles**:  
- When your Explorers completely surround a jungle space (with 2, 3, or 4 sides depending on position), take the Animal Tile from that space.  
- Score VPs equal to the number of sides used to surround it (2, 3, or 4 VPs).  
- The Purple Marker for that animal advances one space on its track (see End Game scoring).

#### Action Phase D (Simultaneous)  
- Reveal and discard the card under D.  
- Advance the Purple Marker of the animal shown in the bottom-right corner by 1 space.  
- Score 1 VP for each Animal Tile (Small or Large) you own of that type.  
  - Large Animal Tiles count as 2 tiles for scoring purposes.  
- Some cards allow alternate effects (e.g., move a different marker, gain bonus).

#### End of Round  
- Pass the Starting Player Card to the left.  
- Begin a new round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Effects  
Cards may provide ongoing or one-time effects based on placement:

- **Action A (Top Half)**: Grants persistent abilities (e.g., use brown cube as any color, reduce placement cost on certain symbols, gain extra actions).  
- **Action B (Bottom Left)**: Grants resource + possible bonus (extra resource, VP, or marker movement) when receiving a specific color.  
- **Action D (Bottom Right)**: Advances animal marker + scores VPs + possible bonus (extra resource, VP, or alternate marker movement).  

#### Terrain & Symbols  
Jungle spaces have:  
- **Color (Terrain Type)**: Brown, Beige, Yellow, Gray, Green  
- **Symbols**: Backpack, Bottle, Hat, Rope, Tent  

Placing an Explorer on a space with matching symbol or terrain may trigger bonuses (from card effects), such as:  
- Gain 1 resource of choice  
- Gain 2 or 3 VPs  
- Reduce placement cost to 1 resource  
- Move any animal marker up 1 space and score accordingly  

#### Special Rules & Edge Cases  
- **Explorer Placement**: You may not place a second Explorer of your color on the same space.  
- **Moving Explorers**: Allowed when no Explorers remain in your supply.  
- **Surrounding**: Must fully enclose a tile with your own Explorers (adjacent edges). Once taken, the tile is removed and the space becomes empty.  
- **Cardholder Slots**: Some cards grant an additional slot (total of 4).  
- **Card Drawing**: Some cards let you draw 4 cards and discard 1 after assigning 3.  
- **Large Animal Tiles**: Always count as 2 tiles for set collection and scoring.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Most leftover Resources.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends at the end of the round when the **sum of the positions of all Purple Markers** on the animal tracks is:  
- **≥7** in a 2-player game  
- **≥9** in a 3-player game  
- **≥11** in a 4-player game  

Final scoring:  
- **+10 VP** per complete set of 5 different Animal Types (one Small or Large Tile per type).  
  - Large Tile = 2 of that animal → can help complete multiple sets.  
- **+VP equal to the current value (position) of each animal’s Purple Marker**, for each Animal Tile (Small or Large) you own of that type.  
  - Example: If the Dodo marker is at 4, and you have 2 Dodo Tiles, score 4 × 2 = 8 VPs.  
  - Large Tile counts as 2 → e.g., one Large Dodo = 4 × 2 = 8 VPs.  
- **+1 VP for every 2 remaining Resources** (round down).  
- **Most VPs wins**. Tie: player with the most leftover Resources wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I have two identical cards active?**  
  No. Cannot place a card in Action A if it duplicates an already active card in another slot.  

- **What happens when I cover a card in Action A?**  
  The old card is no longer active. Its effect ends immediately.  

- **Can I surround a tile with just one Explorer?**  
  No. Must fully enclose the tile (2, 3, or 4 adjacent sides) with your Explorers.  

- **Do I score VPs when I advance a marker during Phase D?**  
  Yes — immediately score 1 VP per Animal Tile you own of that type.  

- **Can I use wild resources (from cards) for anything?**  
  Yes — a resource that can be used as any color counts as that color for payment, matching, and effects.  

- **Can I trigger multiple bonuses when placing an Explorer?**  
  Yes — if card effects apply to terrain color, symbol, ring, or presence of other Explorers, all applicable bonuses trigger.  

- **Do I get a bonus when I take a surrounded tile?**  
  No — surrounding only grants VPs based on number of sides. No additional card-like bonuses unless specified.  

- **Can I move a marker during Phase D to a different animal than shown?**  
  Only if a card effect allows it (e.g., “You may move any marker instead of the [animal]”).
