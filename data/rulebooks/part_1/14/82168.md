2. **Distribute Materials**: Each player gets a Map Book and marker.  
3. **Shuffle Dangerous Sector Deck**: Place face-down within reach.  
4. **Determine Roles**:  
   - Separate Character Cards into Human (blue) and Alien (red) piles.  
   - Draw half the number of players from each pile. If odd number of players, draw one extra Alien card.  
   - Shuffle selected cards together and deal one to each player.  
   - Players keep identity secret.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Dangerous Sector Cards  
After moving into a Dangerous Sector (and not attacking), draw one card:  

- **Noise in Your Sector**: Announce your actual location: "NOISE IN SECTOR [X,Y]".  
- **Noise in Any Sector**: Announce any sector: "NOISE IN SECTOR [X,Y]" (can bluff).  
- **Silence**: Announce "SILENCE IN ALL SECTORS". Keep card.  
- **Item**: Announce "SILENCE IN ALL SECTORS". Keep card for use.  

> Discard Noise cards face-down after use. Keep Silence and Item cards until used. Reshuffle discarded Noise cards if deck runs out.

#### Attacking  
Only Aliens may attack unless using Attack Item or Soldier ability.  

**Steps**:  
1. After movement, announce "I ATTACK IN SECTOR [X,Y]".  
2. Any player in that sector must reveal themselves.  
3. That player is killed:  
   - Discard all held cards.  
   - Reveal Character Card.  
4. **Human killed**: Returns next turn as Alien from Alien Sector (no items or abilities).  
5. **Alien killed**: Eliminated permanently.  

> Attacking reveals Alien identity. Use carefully.

#### Alien Feeding  
- If an Alien kills at least one Human, their movement increases to **1–3 sectors per turn** for the rest of the game.  
- Bonus does not stack with multiple kills.

#### Items  
Only **Humans** can use Items (except specific Alien roles).  
Aliens may collect and hold Items to bluff as Humans.  

**Rules**:  
- Keep Items face-down.  
- Use at any time during your turn (even same turn drawn).  
- May use multiple per turn.  
- Each use is one-time; discard after use.  

**Item Types**:  
- **Attack**: Attack like an Alien. Still move only 1 sector.  
- **Teleport**: Move directly to Human Sector (in addition to normal move).  
- **Adrenaline**: Move 2 sectors this turn.  
- **Sedatives**: Avoid drawing Dangerous Sector Card this turn.  
- **Defence**: Play when attacked. Survive unharmed.  
- **Spotlight**: Name a sector. All players in that sector or adjacent must reveal coordinates.  
- **Clone**: Play when attacked. Avoid transformation. Next turn, restart from Human Sector (lose all cards).  
- **Sensor**: Force one player to reveal their current coordinates.  
- **Mutation**: Turn into an Alien. Play from current sector.  
- **Cat**: Before drawing a Dangerous Sector Card, play to declare **two** noises. If drew Noise in Your Sector, one must be real. Discard Silence/Item drawn as if it were a Noise card.

#### Character Abilities  
Each character has a unique power. Use secretly unless stated. Mark turn used with * on Movement Record.  

**Human Crew**:  
- **Captain**: Immune to first Dangerous Sector draw.  
- **Pilot**: Once, when drawing a Dangerous Sector Card, act as if played Cat (declare two noises).  
- **Psychologist**: Starts in Alien Sector.  
- **Soldier**: Can Attack once without Attack card.  
- **Executive Officer**: Once, skip movement. Still resolve sector effect.  
- **Co-Pilot**: Can Teleport once. Must reveal identity.  
- **Engineer**: At Escape Pod, draw 2 Escape Pod Cards, choose one. Shuffle unused back.  
- **Medic**: Once, force another player to reveal identity. Must reveal own.

**Alien Crew**:  
- **Blink Alien**: Can use Teleport Items without revealing identity.  
- **Silent Alien**: Can use Sedatives Items without revealing identity.  
- **Surge Alien**: Can use Adrenaline Items without revealing identity.  
- **Brute Alien**: Immune to attacks. Reveal identity when attacked.  
- **Invisible Alien**: Immune to Sensor and Spotlight. Reveal identity when targeted.  
- **Lurking Alien**: May attack without moving.  
- **Fast Alien**: First move, can go up to 3 sectors.
