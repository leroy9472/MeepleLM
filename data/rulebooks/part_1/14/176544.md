## Automania – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Automania is a strategic worker placement and tile management game set in a stylized automotive industry. Players act as factory owners competing to produce and sell cars across two markets—North American and European—over four rounds. The goal is to maximize victory points (VP) through car sales, fulfilled contracts, styling and production efficiency, and end-game bonuses for wealth.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with action area, markets, round track, scoring track, player order track  
- 72 Factory tiles (36 A-side, 36 B-side), including:  
  - Manager tiles  
  - Machine tiles  
  - Styling tiles (Spoiler, Muffler, Dice)  
  - Money / Victory Point (Autobuck/VP) tiles  
- 10 Neutral (gray) workers  
- Player sets (per color):  
  - 6 Colored workers  
  - 7 Car tiles (3 City, 2 Family, 2 Super)  
  - 1 Factory board (A/B sides)  
  - 1 Player order disc

4. Place 10 neutral workers near board.  
5. Shuffle 10 demand tiles and place one on each space in both North American and European markets. If both markets are identical, reshuffle.  
6. Shuffle 26 contract cards (excluding 'S' cards), place face-down as deck. Reveal top 3 as display.

   - Elon: Take yellow Electric car token (adds +1 star when used)  
   - Miao & OPO: Apply respective special powers

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:

#### Action Phase (in turn order)  
Players take turns performing one of two actions:

**A) Take an Action**  
1. **Place worker(s)** on one of 9 action spaces:  
   - If empty: place 1 worker  
   - If occupied by another player: place **more workers** than currently there (e.g., 2 to replace 1)  
   - Return displaced workers to their owners (neutral workers go to supply)  
   - **Cannot** place on a space with your own workers  
2. **Take a tile** (except for corner production space):  
   - Must take 1 tile from the **row or column** of the selected space  
   - If no tile available, cannot use that space  
3. **Place or discard tile** in your factory:  
   - **Manager tiles**: Place in office spaces. Pay office fee **only first time** using that space.  
     - Replace only with same portrait. No fee when replacing.  
   - **Machine tiles**: Place on any assembly line space. May replace any existing machine tile.  
     - Covering preprinted ★ removes its effect.  
   - **Styling tiles**: Place above a car type (City, Family, Super).  
     - Max 3 per car type, all must be **different types** (e.g., Spoiler, Muffler, Dice)  
     - Fees: $1 for 2nd, $2 for 3rd styling tile on a car  
     - Replace only with same styling type. No fee when replacing.  
   - **Money/VP tiles**: Take reward immediately, discard.  
4. **Carry out action**:  
   - **Produce a Car**:  
     - Pay cost: City $1, Family $2, Super $3  
     - Corner space allows choice of car type  
     - Choose market (NA or EU)  
     - Calculate popularity (★) from:  
       - Matching machine tiles vs. market demand (each match = 2–4 ★)  
       - Preprinted ★ on assembly line  
       - Styling tiles for car type  
       - Manager bonuses (e.g., Research)  
       - Workers on Marketing space: +1 ★ per worker  
     - Place car on ship space matching ★ value. If occupied, place on next lower free space.  
     - **Gold Medal**: Score immediate VP if placed on gold medal ship space.  
     - **Double demand**: If market has two identical demands, need two matching machine tiles to score both. Otherwise, score only one (highest value).  
     - **Yacht (18+ ★)**: May place on yacht if vacant. Score +9 VP immediately. Car not sold in sales phase. Returned after next sales phase.  
     - May voluntarily place on lower space.  
     - May choose not to place car (still pay cost).  
     - May return car from ship to factory at any time (except yacht).  
   - **Draw a Contract Card**:  
     - Take 1 from display or top of deck. Replace display if needed.  
     - If no cards left: gain 1 VP instead.  
     - When producing a car, may play **1 contract card** if requirements met.  
       - Show card, place face-down under factory board.  
       - Starting 'S' card: immediate $3 when played  
       - All contracts: +1 VP per silver medal at game end  

**Sponsor & Marketing Spaces (Optional)**  
- **Sponsor space**: At any time during your turn, place workers to gain $1 each.  
- **Marketing space**: When producing a car, place workers to add +1 ★ per worker.  

**B) Withdraw**  
- Place remaining workers on Sponsor space → gain $1 per worker  
- Move player disc to **empty** sales office  
- Sales office determines:  
  - # of cars you can sell in Sales Phase  
  - Turn order for next round  
  - Immediate bonus (if applicable)  
- Once withdrawn, cannot take more actions or use returned workers.  

Continue until all players have withdrawn.

#### Sales Phase  
1. Resolve **North American market first**, then **European**.  
2. In order of **highest ★ to lowest**, each player decides to:  
   - **Sell**: Move car to free sales space, take reward (money or VP)  
   - **Pass**: Leave car on ship for next round  
3. **Top sales space** in each market can hold unlimited cars.  
4. **Sales limit**: Total cars sold across both markets ≤ limit from sales office  
   - Marketing managers allow +1 car per manager  
5. **2-player game rule**: Only one car per row per market (except top space)  

#### New Round  
1. Advance round marker.  
2. **Lowest-scoring player** (tie: lower sales office #) chooses:  
   - Advance **left** or **right** pending demand tile in both markets  
   - Active tiles shift down; displaced tile moves to pending space in **opposite market**  
3. Return cars from sales spaces to owners (ships remain)  
4. Remove all unused factory tiles from board  
5. Place 18 new tiles:  
   - Round 2: A-tiles  
   - Rounds 3–4: B-tiles  
6. Move player order discs to new positions based on sales office choice  
7. Distribute new turn order tokens  
8. Return all workers to players  
9. Staff managers: take neutral workers as shown (only difference if replacing)

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Worker Placement**: Competitive placement with overbidding  
- **Tile Placement & Upgrades**: Strategic factory development  
- **Popularity Calculation**: Combines machine matches, styling, managers, and demand  
- **Sales Order**: Based on car ★ value, not player turn order  
- **Factory Customization**: Long-term investment in efficiency and flexibility  
- **Contract Fulfillment**: One per production action, scored at endgame (+VP, $)  
- **Resource Management**: Workers, money, car supply, and turn timing  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after **Round 4 Sales Phase**. Final scoring:

1. **Remaining Cars on Ships**:  
   - North American market: $1 each  
   - European market: 1 VP each  

2. **Silver Medals**:  
   - 1 VP per silver medal on **completed contract cards** and **factory tiles in play**  

3. **Wealth Bonus**:  
   - Most money: +10 VP  
   - 2nd most: +6 VP  
   - 3rd most: +3 VP  
   - 4th: 0 VP  
   - Tie: higher placement in sales office order wins (lower #)  

4. **Total VP**: Sum all sources. Highest wins.  

**Tiebreaker**: Player with **lowest-numbered sales office** (i.e., would go first next round) wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I produce a car if I can't place it on a ship?**  
  Yes, but you must still pay the production cost. You may not place it on a ship, and no ship bonus applies.  

- **Can I use the same demand tile twice?**  
  No. Each demand tile can only be matched once per car.  

- **Can I replace a styling tile with a different type?**  
  No. Styling tiles can only be replaced with the **same type** (e.g., Spoiler → Spoiler).  

- **Can I copy my own car in Miao’s ability?**  
  No. Miao cannot copy own cars or Elon’s electric car.  

- **What if all sales offices are taken when I withdraw?**  
  Impossible—withdrawals occur sequentially, and you must choose an **empty** office.  

- **Can I sell a car on the yacht?**  
  No. Yacht cars are not sold. They score +9 VP when placed and return to owner after next sales phase.  

- **Do I pay styling fees again when replacing?**  
  No. Fees are only paid when placing the 2nd or 3rd styling tile. Replacing does not incur fees.  

- **Can I use Marketing space workers after placing the car?**  
  No. Workers must be placed **before** placing the car on the ship.  

- **Can I take back a car from the yacht?**  
  No. Car remains on yacht until after next sales phase, then automatically returns.  

- **Can I fulfill a contract if I place car on lower ship space?**  
  Yes. As long as the car meets the requirements (type, styling, ★), contract can be played.
