## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
During the late night watch, the forest falls eerily silent—no wolf howls, no crickets. Orcs and Goblins, with superior night vision, launch a full-scale assault under the cover of darkness. The heroes must defend the Castle against this Midnight Madness. The objective is to survive the onslaught: players win if all monster tokens are drawn and no monsters remain on the board, with at least one Tower still standing. The player with the most kill points becomes the Master Slayer in Standard Mode. In Solo or Co-op Mode, players win or lose as a group—no individual scoring.

2. Components  
- Game board with six colored sections (Red, Green, Blue; two of each)  
- 6 Tower pieces  
- 6 Wall pieces  
- Monster tokens: Trolls, Orcs, Goblins, Bosses (Goblin King, Orc Warlord, Troll Mage, Healer), and Special Effect tokens (Giant Boulder, Plague, Draw 3/4 Monsters, etc.)  
- Player cards: Color- and ring-specific attack cards (Archer, Knight, Swordsman), Hero cards, and Special cards (Barbarian, Tar, Fortify Wall, Scavenge, etc.)  
- Tar token and 2 Fortify tokens  
- White die  

3. Setup  
1. Remove original Turn Order cards—do not use.  
2. Shuffle remaining cards and deal starting hands:  
   - 1–2 players: 6 cards  
   - 3–4 players: 5 cards  
   - 6 players: 4 cards  
   All hands are played FACE UP.  
3. Place 1 Tower in each of the six Castle spaces.  
4. Place 1 Wall on each border between Swordsman and Castle rings.

   - Challenging: 3 Trolls, 3 Orcs  
   - Uber: 3 Trolls, 3 Orcs  
7. Turn all starting monsters FACE DOWN and mix.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows this order:  
1. Draw Up – Draw to starting hand size (skip on first turn).  
2. Discard and Draw (Optional) – Replace cards:  
   - 1 player: replace 2 cards  
   - 2–6 players: replace 1 card  
3. Trade Cards (Optional) – Direct trades with current player:  
   - 2–5 players: 1 trade  
   - 1 or 6 players: 2 trades  
4. Play Cards – Play any number in any order. Cards must match color and ring (except multi-color or Hero cards).  
   - Each card does 1 damage. Multiple cards can target same monster.  
   - When a monster is hit, flip it FACE UP (if hidden), then apply damage.  
   - Resolve traps or boss abilities immediately upon flipping.  
   - Special Cards (e.g., Tar, Drive Him Back!, Scavenge) have unique effects.  
5. Move All Monster Tokens – Each moves one ring closer to Castle (same section).  
   - Into Wall: Wall destroyed, one monster (choice) takes 1 damage, others stay.  
   - Into Tower: Tower destroyed, one monster (choice) takes 1 damage, all advance to Castle ring.  
   - In Castle: Rotate one space clockwise; hitting Tower destroys it, monster takes damage.  
6. FACE UP All Swordsman Ring Monsters – Reveal FACE DOWN monsters in Swordsman ring one at a time (player’s choice of order), resolving traps or abilities immediately.  
7. Draw and Place New Monster Tokens –  
   - Normal/Challenging: Draw 2 FACE DOWN tokens  
   - Uber: Draw 3 FACE DOWN tokens  
   Roll die for each; place in Forest ring of matching section.

5. Core Mechanics  
- FACE DOWN Mechanics:  
  - Monsters start and may move FACE DOWN.  
  - If a FACE DOWN monster advances into a Wall or Tower, it flips FACE UP and resolves immediately.  
  - In multi-monster advance, flip one at a time (player’s choice), then choose which takes damage.  
- Special Tokens (Traps & Bosses):  
  - Healer: When flipped, heal all FACE UP monsters 1 damage.  
  - Goblin King: Draw and resolve 3 FACE DOWN tokens in Forest.  
  - Orc Warlord: Move all monsters in matching color one ring closer (or clockwise in Castle).  
  - Troll Mage: Move all monsters on board one ring closer (or clockwise in Castle).  
  - Giant Boulder: Rolls toward Castle; destroys all monsters in path. Stops at Wall, Tower, or Fortify. Can cross to opposite arc. First structure hit is destroyed.  
  - Plague Archers/Knights/Swordsman: All players discard all cards of that type.  
  - Draw 3/4 Monsters: Draw and resolve that many FACE DOWN tokens in Forest.  
  - Monsters Move Clockwise/Counter-clockwise: Rotate all monsters one section.  
  - Colored Monsters Move 1: Move all monsters in specified color one ring closer.  
- Special Cards:  
  - Brick & Mortar: Rebuild any missing Wall.  
  - Tar: Place on monster; it cannot move until start of next player’s turn. Remove Tar then.  
  - Drive Him Back!: Push any monster back to Forest ring of same section. Does not flip.  
  - Fortify Wall: Place Fortify token on Wall. When monster hits it, monster takes 1 damage, Fortify removed (Wall stays).  
  - Missing: Skip “Draw New Monsters” phase.  
  - Nice Shot: Play with any damage card to instantly kill a monster (after it’s flipped).  
  - Scavenge: Take any card from discard pile (except removed cards).  
  - Draw 2 Cards: Draw 2 extra cards (hand size may exceed limit).

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when all monster tokens have been drawn and no monsters remain on the board.  
- Players win if at least one Tower remains.  
- In Standard Mode:  
  - Kill Points: Boss = 4, Troll = 3, Orc = 2, Goblin = 1  
  - Player who directly kills a monster (via card) keeps the token.  
  - Master Slayer = player with most points. Tiebreaker: most monsters slain.  
- In Solo or Co-op Mode: No scoring. All win or all lose.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can you play a card on a FACE DOWN monster?  
  A: Yes, if it’s in the correct color and ring. When hit, flip it FACE UP, then apply damage and resolve ability.  
- Q: What if a FACE DOWN monster triggers a trap when advancing into a Wall/Tower?  
  A: Flip it immediately. Resolve trap (e.g., Giant Boulder rolls). Wall/Tower is not destroyed by the advance—only damage and destruction rules apply after resolution.  
- Q: Can you use Scavenge to retrieve a card just played?  
  A: Yes, during the same turn.  
- Q: Do you resolve new monster tokens immediately when drawn during another token’s effect?  
  A: Yes, but add them to the end of the current draw queue. Resolve original tokens first.  
- Q: Can Hero cards hit in Forest?  
  A: Only if specified by optional rules. Base Midnight Madness does not allow it.  
- Q: What happens if a monster is Tarred and then affected by a move effect (e.g., Orc Warlord)?  
  A: Tar prevents movement. The monster does not move, even from effects.
