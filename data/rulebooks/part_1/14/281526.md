## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Caravan Quests are special narrative-driven missions tied to the ongoing Campaign in *The Isofarian Guard*. They become available starting in Chapter 2 and are tied to specific Chapters—players may only begin a Caravan Quest for their current Chapter or earlier, but not future ones. Completing a Caravan Quest advances the story and provides unique rewards. These quests are hosted by Sethius, a traveling bard whose caravan moves across the land of Isofar after each Chapter.

The objective is to reach the Caravan Chip on the map, trigger the quest, and complete its storyline as directed by the Campaign Book. Caravan Quests cannot be repeated and require no other Side Quests (Bounty, Side, or otherwise) to be active.

2. Components  
- Caravan Chip (marks the current location of the caravan)  
- Scroll Chip (used in Side Quests; not used for Caravan Quests unless specified)  
- Guards (player-controlled characters)  
- Campaign Book (contains quest text, branching paths, and instructions)  
- Pencil (to mark completion with an "X")  
- Map of Isofar (with nodes indicating locations)

3. Setup  
- Place the Caravan Chip on the starting node specified for the current Chapter’s Caravan Quest (e.g., Node 61 for Chapter 2).  
- Ensure no other Side Quests or Bounty Quests are in progress.  
- Have the corresponding Campaign Book open to the correct quest pages.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. During the Exploration Phase, if the Guards are adjacent to or on the node with the Caravan Chip, they may choose to begin the Caravan Quest.  
2. Move the Guards to the Caravan Chip location.  
3. Begin the quest by referencing the designated pages in the Campaign Book.  
4. Follow the narrative prompts, which may include decision points, combat encounters, or exploration.  
5. If multiple parts exist, the text will instruct movement of the Scroll Chip to new nodes.  
6. Upon completion:  
 - Mark the quest square with an "X" using a pencil.  
 - Remove the Scroll Chip (if used).  
 - Leave the Caravan Chip in place until the Campaign Book instructs moving it.  

Note: Declining the quest means continuing normal exploration—draw a chip from the Event Bag as usual.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Triggering the Quest: Requires moving Guards to the Caravan Chip’s node.  
- Exclusivity Rule: No other Side Quests (Bounty, Side, or Caravan) may be active.  
- Progression: Some quests have multiple scenes; follow Campaign Book instructions for continuation.  
- Movement of Caravan: After each Chapter, the Caravan moves to a new node as directed by the Campaign Book.  
- Completion Tracking: Use pencil to mark completed quests on the campaign sheet.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Caravan Quests do not use traditional scoring.  
- Completion contributes to narrative progression and unlocks rewards (e.g., items, lore, stat bonuses).  
- Once completed, the quest is permanently marked and cannot be replayed.  
- Completion status is recorded in campaign save sheets for continuity into future campaigns.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
Q: Can I do a Caravan Quest from a previous Chapter?  
A: Yes, if you’ve progressed beyond that Chapter, you may complete earlier Caravan Quests.

Q: What happens if I have a Side Quest active?  
A: You must complete or abandon it before starting a Caravan Quest.

Q: Does the Caravan move during a quest?  
A: No. The Caravan Chip remains in place until the Campaign Book instructs relocation.

Q: Can I skip the battle phase during a Caravan Quest?  
A: Only if the Cinematic Mode rules are enabled and all enemies in the encounter have been previously defeated (per Cinematic Mode rules).

Q: Is the Scroll Chip always used in Caravan Quests?  
A: Only if the quest has multiple parts and the text explicitly instructs moving it.
