### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Installing & Rezzing  
- **Set Agenda / Node**: Place face down in Data Fort. Can trash existing card and replace it at no extra cost beyond the action.  
- **Install Upgrade**: Can go into active or empty Data Fort. Multiple Upgrades allowed per Fort.  
- **Install ICE**:  
  - First ICE on a server: Free  
  - Second: 1 Bit  
  - Third: 2 Bits  
  - nth ICE: (n–1) Bits  
  - Trash ICE at any time for free (no action or cost).  
- **Rezzing**:  
  - **Node / Upgrade**: Can be rezzed at:  
    - Start of either player’s turn  
    - After any action  
    - During a run: when Runner approaches or passes ICE  
    - Just before accessing Data Fort contents  
  - **ICE**: Can be rezzed when Runner approaches it during a run.  
  - **Operations**: Played and resolved immediately; discard after.  

#### Advancing & Scoring Agendas  
- Pay 1 Bit to place 1 Advancement Token on a card (1 action).  
- Agendas score when advancement requirement is met.  
- Scoring does not use an action, but can only occur:  
  - At the start of Corporation’s turn  
  - After any Corporation action  
- Once scored, move Agenda to score area. Cannot be advanced further.  
- Nodes can be advanced before and after rezzing.  

#### Tags  
- Runner receives a **Tag** when a trace is successful.  
- While tagged, Corporation may pay **2 Bits** to trash **1 Resource** the Runner has in play.  

#### Damage  
- **Meat, Net, or Brain Damage**: Each point causes loss of 1 random card from hand.  
- **Brain Damage**: Also reduces Runner’s hand size by 1 permanently per point.  

#### Runner Actions  

**Install Cards**:  
- Place vertically in appropriate row (programs, resources, hardware), face up.  
- Pay installation cost immediately.  
- Total MU of installed programs cannot exceed available MU.  

**Use Prep Cards**:  
- Play, pay cost, resolve effect, then discard.  

**Making a Run**:  
- Runner can always make a run (assumed basic equipment).  
- Choose server (R&D, HQ, Archives, or specific Data Fort).  
- If no ICE: access freely.  
- If ICE: resolve from outermost to innermost.  

**Dealing with ICE**:  
1. **Approach ICE**: Corp may rez it.  
2. **Break Subroutines**:  
   - Use Icebreakers matching ICE type (Sentry, Code Gate, Wall, Killer).  
   - Icebreaker Strength ≥ ICE Strength to break.  
   - Each subroutine must be broken or its effect suffered.  
   - If a subroutine says "End the run", failure to break ends run immediately; no further subroutines resolve.  
3. **Pass ICE**: After breaking all subroutines, Runner may **Jack Out** (end run) or continue.  
4. After passing all ICE, Runner may Jack Out before accessing.  

**Successful Run – Access Phase**:  
- **R&D**: Access top card.  
  - If Agenda: steal (score).  
  - If trashing allowed: pay cost to trash.  
  - Else: return to top of R&D.  
- **HQ**: Access 1 random card from hand.  
  - If Agenda: steal.  
  - If trashing allowed: pay cost to trash.  
  - Else: return to HQ.  
- **Archives**: Flip face-down cards face up; access all face-up cards.  
- **Data Fort**: Access all Nodes and Upgrades in the Fort.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Simultaneous Actions**: Runner acts first. Once Corporation takes an action, Runner cannot retroactively respond.  
- **Replacing Cards in Data Fort**: Agendas/Nodes can be trashed and replaced freely (only action cost applies).  
- **ICE Installation Cost**: Scales with number already on server (0, 1, 2, ... Bits).  
- **Trashing ICE**: Free, no action required.  
- **Rezzing Timing**:  
  - ICE: Only when approached during a run.  
  - Nodes/Upgrades: Multiple windows (turn start, after actions, during run).  
- **Accessing After Passing ICE**: Runner may Jack Out even after passing all ICE, before access.  
- **Hand Size Reduction**: Brain damage permanently reduces max hand size.  
- **Tag Use**: Corporation may spend 2 Bits anytime (during Runner's turn, even) to trash a Resource if Runner is tagged.
