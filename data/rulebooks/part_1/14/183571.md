## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
You are the Captain of the USS Crypsis, a RPTR-class starship on patrol in the Auborne system. After responding to a distress call, you discover it was a trap. With your crew, you must survive by managing internal and external threats until rescue arrives.  

**Objective**:  
- Destroy all external threats in the threat deck.  
- Survive to the point where no more threat cards can be drawn.  
- Maintain at least 1 Hull point.  

2. **Components**  
- 1 Ship Board  
- 6 Crew Dice  
- 1 Threat Die  
- 1 Gray Hull Tracker Cube (starts at 8)  
- 1 Green Shield Tracker Cube (starts at 4)  
- 36 Threat Cards (mix of Internal and External threats)  
- Optional: "Don't Panic!" cards (difficulty modifiers)  

3. **Setup**  
1. Place the Ship Board in the center.  
2. Set Hull Tracker to 8 and Shield Tracker to 4.  
3. Shuffle the Threat Deck and place it above the board.  
4. Draw 2 Threat Cards and place them in their designated zones:  
   - Internal Threats: Left side of the board (Internal Threat Zone)  
   - External Threats: Right side, aligned with their starting health on the Damage Track  
5. All Crew Dice are available to roll at the start.  

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Each round proceeds in six steps:  

1. **Roll available Crew Dice**  
   - Roll all dice from your available pool.  
   - Immediately lock any **Threat Detected (○)** results into the Scanners area.  

2. **Scan for Threats**  
   - For every 3 Threat Detected symbols in Scanners, draw a new threat card, then return all Threat Detected dice to the pool.  
   - If fewer than 3, they remain locked in Scanners until threshold is met.  

3. **Assign Crew to Stations/Missions**  
   - Assign dice to Crew Stations or Away Missions (on Internal/External Threats with crew icons).  
   - Resolve actions immediately.  
   - You may assign dice to incomplete missions to "lock in" progress.  
   - Unassigned dice remain unused.  

4. **Discover new threats**  
   - Draw 1 new threat card:  
     - Internal: Place on left side (Internal Threat Zone)  
     - External: Place on right side, aligned with starting health on Damage Track  
   - If the deck is empty, skip this step.  

5. **Activate threats**  
   - Roll the Threat Die.  
   - Activate all threats (Internal first, then External) that match the rolled number.  
   - Resolve effects top to bottom, left to right.  
   - Hull damage is applied to Shields first. If Shields are depleted, Hull takes remaining damage.  
   - If Hull reaches 0, you lose immediately.  

6. **Gather all available Crew**  
   - Return assigned dice to your pool.  
   - Dice in:  
     - Infirmary  
     - Scanners  
     - Distracted threats  
     - Assigned to incomplete Away Missions (optional to gather)  
     — are **not** automatically gathered.  
   - If you cannot gather **any** dice, you lose (crew incapacitated).  

5. **Core Mechanics**  

- **Crew Stations**:  
  - **Commander**: Change any die to any face, or re-roll unassigned dice.  
  - **Tactical**: Deal damage equal to number of dice to one or more External Threats.  
  - **Medical**: Return all dice from Infirmary to pool, OR return a Threat Detected die from Scanners.  
  - **Science**: Fully recharge Shields to 4, OR use Stasis Beam (place die on threat to suppress next activation).  
  - **Engineering**: Repair Hull by amount equal to number of dice (max 8).  
  - **Threat Detected (○)**: Must be placed in Scanners when rolled.  

- **Threats**:  
  - **External (▽)**: Cause Hull/Shield damage when activated. Placed on Damage Track.  
  - **Internal (□)**: Cause adverse effects (e.g., crew loss, action restrictions).  
  - **Away Missions**: Complete by assigning required crew symbols. Upon completion, move dice to "Returned" section.  
  - **Special Threats**:  
    - **Distracted**: Place 1 crew die on ? space when revealed. Unavailable until threat is resolved.  
    - **Time Warp**: Threats cannot exceed starting health.  
    - **Nebula**: Shields cannot be used or recharged. When destroyed, reset Shield Tracker to 0.  
    - **Boost Morale / Friendly Fire**: If effect is impossible, discard card with no effect.  

- **Scanners Mechanic**:  
  - Threat Detected dice are locked here.  
  - When 3 accumulate, draw a new threat card and reset all Threat Detected dice to pool.  
  - Can be cleared early using Medical action.  

- **Damage Track**:  
  - External threats start at their listed health value.  
  - Move down as damage is dealt.  
  - When reduced to 0, threat is destroyed and discarded.  

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- **Win Condition** (checked at start of Step 4):  
  1. No more cards in the Threat Deck to draw.  
  2. All External Threats are destroyed.  
  3. Hull is above 0.  
- **Loss Conditions**:  
  - Hull reaches 0.  
  - Cannot gather any Crew Dice at Step 6.  
  - Boazanian Sky Rook is completed (in Voltes V retheme).  

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can I assign a die to a mission I can’t complete?**  
  Yes. This "locks" the die to the mission for progress.  
- **Can I gather dice from a mission before completing it?**  
  Yes, during Step 6, you may choose to gather uncompleted mission dice.  
- **What happens if I roll 3 Threat Detected dice but already have 2 in Scanners?**  
  You now have 5 total. That’s 1 full set of 3 → draw 1 card, return 3 dice. 2 remain in Scanners.  
- **Can Science both recharge Shields and use Stasis Beam in one turn?**  
  No. Choose one action per die assigned.  
- **Can Commander change a Threat Detected die?**  
  Yes, before it is locked into Scanners. Once placed, it cannot be changed.
