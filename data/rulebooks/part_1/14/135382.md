### 1. Lore & Objective
In the dystopian "Sixth World" of Shadowrun, megacorporations dominate society while magic has returned. Players are shadowrunners—outsiders living in the margins—who must survive dangerous missions. In the "Are you not entertained?" mission, runners are captured and forced into a gladiatorial arena known as the 27th annual runner roundup. The team’s objective is to fight through waves of obstacles across four scenes to secure their release. The team wins by defeating all obstacles in all scenes. If any runner's HP reaches critical (i.e., takes damage while staggered), the mission ends immediately in failure.

### 3. Setup
1. **Deck Preparation**:
   - Remove from Normal Obstacle Deck: cards 12, 21, 30, 23, 28, 39, 34, 36.
   - Remove from Hard Obstacle Deck: cards 49, 53, 65.
   - Shuffle both decks separately.

2. **Player Setup**:
   - Each player chooses a Runner card and a Role (Face, Street Samurai, Decker, Mage).
   - Place Role card to the left of Runner card; place Runner card face up.
   - Shuffle starting deck (based on role) and place to the right of Runner card.
   - Draw starting hand (based on metatype).
   - Take starting nuyen as indicated on Runner card.
   - Place Health and Max Health markers according to starting HP.

3. **Mission Setup**:
   - Each runner adds one additional basic card of their choice per role.
   - Apply special rules:
     - **Slow Start**: Each runner takes 1 fewer extra basic card at start.
     - **At my signal, unleash hell**: When revealing the first Crossfire card, place it in discard and reveal the next.
   - Shuffle Black Market deck and reveal 6 cards face up.
   - Choose a starting runner (e.g., highest HP).
   - Shuffle Crossfire deck and place in front of starting runner.

4. **Scene Setup**:
   - At the start of each Scene, flip obstacles based on the table:
     - Scene 1: Number of runners + 1
     - Scene 2: Number of runners + 1
     - Scene 3: Number of runners + 2
     - Scene 4: Number of runners + 2
   - First, flip Hard Obstacle cards equal to Crossfire level.
   - Then flip remaining from Normal Obstacle deck.
   - First obstacle placed does not match selected runner’s role color.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Start of Round**:
   - Starting runner discards current Crossfire card (if any) and draws a new one.
   - Apply Crossfire event (primary and level-triggered effects).

2. **Turn Sequence** (clockwise, starting with starting runner):
   - **Play Cards**: Play cards one at a time from hand, placing them next to target obstacles. Resolve non-damage abilities. Cards remain in play until damage is applied.
   - **Apply Damage**: Apply damage from played cards to chosen obstacle. Damage must clear levels left to right. Partial damage resets at turn end.
   - **Take Damage**: Obstacles facing the current runner attack. Total damage (Attack Strength + triggered abilities) is applied at once.
   - **Draw & Buy Cards**:
     - If 3 or fewer cards in hand, draw 2.
     - Buy any number of Black Market cards affordable with current nuyen. Replace bought cards immediately.
   - **End Turn**: Pass to next runner. If starting runner’s turn ends, begin new round.

3. **Scene End**:
   - After any turn ends with no obstacles in play:
     - Scene 1 and 3: Each runner heals 1 HP.
     - Scene 2: Each runner heals 2 HP.
     - Reveal Black Market cards until 6 are shown.
     - Runners may buy from Black Market; no restock after purchase.
     - Discard unsold Black Market cards before next scene.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Damage Types**:
  - Colored (Black, Blue, Green, Red): Must match damage track color.
  - Colorless (e.g., ②): Any color or mixed; cannot clear colored levels.
- **Defeating Obstacles**:
  - Clear all levels of damage track left to right.
  - When defeated, resolve "DEFEATED:" ability.
  - Distribute nuyen: current runner takes first, then clockwise.
- **Healing and Staggered**:
  - Healing cannot exceed starting HP.
  - At 0 HP: become Staggered.
    - Shuffle hand and discard into deck.
    - Draw 1 card at start of turn.
    - Cannot draw or buy cards during Draw & Buy phase.
    - If healed 1+ HP while staggered, draw 2 cards and recover.
  - Taking damage while Staggered: go Critical → mission fails.
- **Black Market**:
  - At start of each scene, reveal cards equal to number of obstacles.
  - After defeating an obstacle, current runner may buy one card ≤ obstacle’s value.
  - Unspent nuyen distributed clockwise starting with runner to the right.
  - After scene ends, restock to 6 cards; unsold cards discarded.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: Defeat all obstacles in all four scenes.
  - Karma Reward: 4 per runner.
- **Loss Condition**:
  - Any runner goes Critical → mission fails immediately.
  - All runners staggered or critical during abort → loss.
  - Karma Reward: 0.
- **Karma Modifiers**:
  - Based on total upgrades (in Karma):
    - 10–20: +4 Karma
    - 21–40: +3
    - 41–50: +2
    - 50–60: +1
    - 60+: 0
- **Special Rules Impact**:
  - **Slow Start**: (+1 Karma)
  - **At my signal, unleash hell**: +1 Karma per Crossfire card discarded this way.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I play cards with no target?** Yes. You may play cards even if no obstacle is present.
- **Can I move cards after playing?** Yes. You may reposition previously played cards before applying damage.
- **What happens to unspent nuyen?** Distributed to other runners clockwise starting with runner to the right.
- **When is Black Market restocked?** Never. After buying, replace only the purchased card. At scene end, restock to 6 cards before purchase phase, then discard unsold.
- **Can I buy multiple cards after defeating an obstacle?** No. Only one card per defeated obstacle, and only if ≤ obstacle’s value.
- **What if Black Market deck runs out?** Shuffle discard to restock. If no discard, market remains empty.
- **Can assist abilities be used during scene end purchase?** No. Assist abilities only during another runner’s turn.
- **What happens if multiple obstacles are defeated in one turn?** Buy one card per obstacle, in order defeated. Distribute nuyen for each separately, starting with current runner.
