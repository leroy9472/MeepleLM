## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Emperor Trajan is constructing the Forum Trajanum, a grand monument to his reign. Each player governs a Colonia (a city founded by Trajan) and seeks to develop it while sending envoys to Rome to contribute to the Forum. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) through building, citizen management, envoy placement, and fulfilling Trajan’s tasks across 3 Cycles.

The player with the most VP after the third Cycle wins. Tiebreakers: most active Citizens, then most remaining Resources.

2. Shuffle Street Cards into 3 face-down piles of 8; place one on each Cycle’s card space.  
3. Lay out Mosaic Boards:  
   - 2 players: 3 Mosaic Boards  
   - 3 players: 4 Mosaic Boards  
   - 4 players: 5 Mosaic Boards  
   Arrange randomly; align grids.  
4. Place Column Fragments:  
   - 3 VP Plinth → Trajan Column space  
   - 2 VP Pillar → 2nd Street Card pile  
   - 1 VP Capital → 3rd Street Card pile

6. Sort Building Tiles:  
   - Double Tiles: place half showing gray+color, half showing 2 colors  
   - Single Tiles: stack by color, half face-up, half face-down  
   Position double tiles above Forum, single tiles below.  
7. Supply: place Coins, Workers, Builders, Assistants, Tribunes, and Multiplication Markers near board.  

#### Player Boards (Colonia)  
Each player:  
1. Choose Player Board side (A: uniform layout; B: unique per player).  
2. Place Slide Bar: top-left of Prestige Track, basic side up (Trajan head in 3rd box).  
3. Place 4 Construction Cranes: one per color, in corners, face-up.

   - From 3 Female Envoys, randomly select 1; flip to show Citizen (Patrician, Merchant, or Craftsman); place on leftmost space of matching row.  
   - Flip remaining 2 Envoys to Citizens; place on any two diagonally opposite Cranes.  
5. Fill remaining spaces:  
   - Shuffle remaining 31 Colonia Tiles (envoy side up), place face-down on all empty spaces except Temples (4 spaces, never built on).  
   - One tile remains; place it face-down on river space (bottom-right), may peek.  
6. Starting Resources:  
   - 1 Tribune, 1 Builder, 1 Assistant, 1 Coin  
   - 1 Worker of each color → randomly distribute one per player (others to supply)

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 3 Cycles. Each Cycle:  
- 4 Rounds  
- 1 Scoring Phase after 4th Round  

#### Round Setup  
1. Draw 2 Street Cards from current Cycle’s pile; place face-up.  
2. **At start of Cycle II and III**: move Column Fragment from next pile to top of Trajan Column. Top number = base VP for Triumphal Columns.  

#### Phase 1: Simultaneous Tile Selection  
1. Each player takes 1 Colonia Tile from each street indicated by the 2 Street Cards.  
   - May take from corners (Construction Cranes).  
   - May look at first tile before taking second.  
   - **Tribune Use**: spend 1 Tribune to ignore a Street Card and take tile from anywhere.  
   - If unable to take 2 tiles and unwilling to spend Tribune(s):  
     - Take 1 or 0 tiles  
     - Do not pass a tile  
     - Right neighbor picks 1 face-up tile previously passed to them (removes it from game)  
2. Choose 1 tile to keep; pass the other face-down to right neighbor.  

#### Phase 2: Turn Order (Clockwise)  
On your turn:  
1. **Place Tiles**:  
   - Flip both tiles face-up.  
   - Choose 1 to use; discard the other.  
   - **Tribune Use**: spend 2 Tribunes at start of turn to use both tiles.  
2. **Gain Benefit from Used Tile**:  
   - If Resource: gain immediately (Worker, Builder, Assistant, Coin, Tribune, Upgrade).  
   - If Citizen: place in matching row (left space if first, right if second).  
     - First Citizen: grants ability (see *Citizens*).  
     - Second Citizen: gain one-time bonus (Envoy, Area Bonus, Coin/Tribune, Coin/Assistant, Worker, Builder).  
     - If placing second in row with inactive first → reactivate first.  
3. **Discard Handling**:  
   - Opponent’s tile → place face-up to right of your board.  
   - Your tile → place face-down on Ship space (becomes Envoy for Forum).  
   - Citizen tile used → remains on board.  
4. **Optional Building Action**:  
   - Spend required resources to build 1 Structure Tile on empty space (not Temples).  
   - **Single Gray**: 1 Builder → Library, Market, Basilica, Triumphal Column  
   - **Single Color**: 1 matching Worker → Fountain, House, Stable, Park  
   - **Double Tile**:  
     - Gray + Color → 1 Builder + 1 matching Worker  
     - 2 Colors → 2 matching Workers  
     - Assistants can substitute for color flexibility.  
   - **Gain Building Benefit**:  
     - **Gray Building**:  
       - Triumphal Column: VP = Column Fragment value + 1 VP per Active Citizen  
       - Library/Market/Basilica: move Forum Marker 1 space forward; gain benefit from current or previous space  
       - After 4th on a track: move marker to Trajan Column; score VP (same as Triumphal Column)  
     - **Color Building**: place 1 Envoy (from Ship) on Forum in matching color area  
       - If double color → place 2 Envoys  
       - Must place in existing incomplete area unless ability allows otherwise  
       - Completing area → gain 1 Area Bonus (Tribune, Assistant, Coin, Upgrade, 2 VP)  
       - Patrician II → gain 2 different bonuses  
5. Pass Starting Player Figure to right.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Citizens  
- 6 per player: 2 per class (Patrician, Merchant, Craftsman), 2 rows each.  
- **Active**: face-up; requires payment of 1 Coin per row during Scoring Phase.  
- **Inactive**: face-down; no abilities, no VP multipliers.  
- **First in Row**: grants special ability.  
- **Second in Row**: grants one-time bonus; increases row multiplier to x3.  
- **Reactivation**: if first is inactive and second is placed → first reactivated.  

#### Special Abilities  
- **Patrician I**:  
  - Ignore color area rules (can start new area even if one in progress)  
  - Score 1 VP for Envoys diagonally adjacent to Eagles  
- **Patrician II**: gain 2 different Area Bonuses when completing area  
- **Merchant I**:  
  - Flip Slide Bar over when activated  
  - When gaining Upgrade, advance to next Cypress Tree  
- **Merchant II**: once per turn, exchange 1 Coin, Tribune, or Assistant for another  
- **Craftsman I**: twice per turn, exchange 1 Assistant for 1 Worker of any color  
- **Craftsman II**: once per turn, exchange 1 Assistant for 1 Builder  

#### Resources  
- **Builder**: build gray structures  
- **Worker**: build colored structures; 2 same-color Workers = 1 Builder  
- **Assistant**: convert Worker to any color; used in exchanges  
- **Tribune**:  
  - Spend 1 to take tile from anywhere  
  - Spend 2 to use both tiles in Phase 2  
- **Coin**: pay for Citizens during Scoring Phase  
- **Upgrade**: move Slide Bar 1 space right → increases Trajan Scoring VP  

#### Forum Mechanics  
- **Color Areas**: connected same-color spaces on Mosaic Boards  
  - First placement in color → start new area  
  - If area in progress → must place there  
- **Eagles**:  
  - Cannot place Envoys on Eagles (except via Library 3rd benefit)  
  - Score:  
    - On Eagle: 2 VP  
    - Orthogonally adjacent: 1 VP  
    - Diagonally adjacent (Patrician I): 1 VP  
- **Largest Connected Area**: score VP based on size and Slide Bar position (value below number)

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Scoring Phase (after each Cycle)  
1. **Pay Citizens**:  
   - Pay 1 Coin per row with ≥1 Citizen  
   - Unpaid rows → flip Citizens to inactive  
2. **Construction Crane Scoring**:  
   - For each uncovered Crane this Cycle:  
     - Cycle I: 3 VP per matching-color Structure  
     - Cycle II: 2 VP per  
     - Cycle III: 1 VP per  
   - Flip Crane to colorless side after scoring  
   - Bonuses:  
     - 1st & 4th Cranes: gain 1 Honorary Citizen (place as Citizen or Envoy)  
     - 2nd Crane: 2 VP per orthogonally adjacent built space  
     - 3rd Crane: remove any number of scored Cranes from board  
3. **Colonia Scoring**:  
   - For each row:  
     - Count different Gray Structures (max 4)  
     - Multiply by:  
       - 0 Citizens: x1  
       - 1 Active Citizen: x2  
       - 2 Active Citizens: x3  
4. **Forum Scoring**:  
   - Eagles: 2 VP per Envoy on Eagle, 1 VP per orthogonally adjacent  
   - Patrician I: +1 VP per diagonally adjacent  
   - Largest Connected Area: score VP based on size and Slide Bar (value below number)  
5. **Trajan Scoring**:  
   - Each Trajan Card has 2 Tasks:  
     - Building Task (pattern on board)  
     - Collecting Task (resources, markers, etc.)  
   - VP per completed task = value above Trajan Head on Slide Bar (3, 5, or 7)  
   - Can complete each task multiple times (using different configurations/resources)  
   - No worker conversion or Tribune use during evaluation  

#### End of Game  
After Cycle III Scoring Phase:  
- Total all VP  
- Winner: most VP  
- Tiebreakers:  
  1. Most Active Citizens  
  2. Most Remaining Resources
