## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Honshu is set in feudal Japan, where players take on the roles of noble lords and ladies expanding their domains. The objective is to build a personal map of land tiles over 12 rounds to maximize final scoring through forests, towns, lakes, factories, and production resources. Victory comes from strategic map expansion and resource management.

### 2. Components  
- 40 Wooden Resources: 10 each of blue, brown, grey, and yellow  
- 6 Starting Province Cards (A-side: symmetric setup; B-side: asymmetric setup)  
- 60 Map Cards (numbered 1–60)  
- 8 End of Game Scoring Cards  
- 5 Player Order Cards (numbered 1–5)  
- 5 Scoring Summary Cards  
- 1 Score Pad  

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Place all resources in a central common pool.  
2. Choose either A-side or B-side of the Starting Province Cards. Shuffle and deal one to each player, face-up.  
3. Place one matching resource on each production square of the Starting Province Card.  
4. Deal one random Player Order Card and one Scoring Summary Card to each player, face-up.  
5. Shuffle the 60 Map Cards and deal 6 to each player face-down. The remainder form a draw pile.  
6. Reveal one random End of Game Scoring Card at the beginning of the game (optional rule).  

Players begin with their Starting Province Card as the foundation of their map.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **12 rounds**, each consisting of two phases:

#### Card Selection Phase (called Trick-Taking Phase in earlier rules)  
**For 3–5 Players:**  
- In player order (1 to 5), each player plays one Map Card face-up.  
- Optionally, a player may place one resource from their map onto their played card:  
  - The first resource played this round can be any type.  
  - Subsequent resources must match the type of the first.  
  - Each resource increases the card’s value by 60.  
- After all cards are played, a new player order is determined by descending total card value (card number + 60 per resource).  
- Players then select one of the played Map Cards in this new order (1st picks first).  
- Used resources return to the common pool.  

**For 2 Players:**  
- Two Map Cards are revealed from the draw pile to form **Pair A**.  
- Both players simultaneously reveal one Map Card from hand—this forms **Pair B**.  
- The player with the higher-numbered card wins and chooses either Pair A or B.  
- **Before** the winner takes their pair, the loser may **remove two resources** from their map to instead take either pair.  
- The unchosen pair goes to the other player.  
- Each player discards one card from their pair and proceeds to the Map Phase with the remaining card.

#### Building Phase (called Map Phase in earlier rules)  
- Each player places their acquired Map Card into their personal map.  
- Placement rules:  
  - At least one square must overlap (be on top of or under) a previously placed card.  
  - At least one square must remain visible.  
  - **Lake squares must always be visible and cannot be hidden.**  
- Place one matching resource on each **new** production square.  
- If a new card covers an existing production square with a resource, that resource is returned to the pool.

#### Round Progression  
- The player holding Player Order Card #1 starts the next Card Selection Phase.  
- Exceptions:  
  - **After Round 3**: Players pass remaining 3 hand cards to the player on their **left**.  
  - **After Round 6**: Deal 6 new cards from the draw pile to each player.  
  - **After Round 9**: Players pass remaining 3 hand cards to the player on their **right**.  
  - **After Round 12**: Proceed to Final Scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Area Types on Map Cards  
- **Forest**: Each visible forest square scores 2 points in final scoring.  
- **Town**: Each town square scores 1 point, but **only the largest town district** (orthogonally connected group) counts.  
- **Production Square**: Receives a matching resource when placed. Can be used:  
  - In Card Selection Phase to boost card value by 60.  
  - In final scoring to deliver to matching factory.  
- **Factory**: In final scoring, unused resources can be moved to matching factories for 1 point each. Only one resource per factory.  
- **Lake**:  
  - Must remain visible—cannot be covered.  
  - Scoring: First lake square in a district = 0 points; each additional = 1 point.  
- **Desert/Fallow**: No gameplay effect. Used only as a tiebreaker in final scoring (2016 rules use "Fallow", 2017 use "Desert").

#### Scoring Rules  
- A single square **cannot be scored more than once**.  
- Holes in the map are allowed—no requirement for continuity.  
- Players may place a card over their own previous cards, including production squares (resource is discarded if covered).  
- Players may take their own played Map Card during selection if available.

#### End of Game Scoring Cards  
One is revealed at game start. Examples:  
- Card 4: Each lake square worth 2 points (overrides normal lake scoring).  
- Card 5: Town squares adjacent to exactly 4 others score 4 points each.  
- Card 6: Score visible empty production squares **before** moving resources to factories.  
- Other effects include bonus points for forests, deserts, or extra factory scoring.

#### Drafting Variant (Official)  
Can replace Card Selection Phase:  
- **3–5 Players**:  
  - Simultaneously choose 1 card from hand, place face-down next to map.  
  - Pass remaining hand face-down: **clockwise rounds 1–6**, **counterclockwise rounds 7–12**.  
  - Do not look at passed cards until selection.  
- **2 Players**:  
  - Simultaneously choose 1 card, place face-down.  
  - Draw 1 card from draw pile.  
  - Discard 1 card from new hand.  
  - Pass remaining cards face-down to opponent.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Final scoring occurs after Round 12. Players total points from:  

- **Forests**: 2 points per visible forest square.  
- **Towns**: 1 point per square in the **largest** town district.  
- **Lakes**:  
  - Normal: First square in each lake district = 0; each additional = 1.  
  - Modified by End of Game Scoring Cards (e.g., 2 points per lake square).  
- **Factories**:  
  - 1 point per resource delivered to matching factory.  
  - Some cards allow two resources per factory or bonus points.  
- **Production Squares**: Some scoring cards award points for visible empty ones (scored **before** factory delivery).  
- **Desert/Fallow**: Used only as tiebreaker (e.g., 2x2 block scoring).  

**Total all points. Highest score wins.** Ties broken by desert/fallow scoring if applicable.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Are resources limited?**  
  Yes—only 10 of each color. When pool is empty, no more can be taken. (Designer suggests unlimited, but official rules state limited.)  

- **Can I take one of my own cards in Card Selection Phase?**  
  Yes—if you are picking and your card is still available, you may take it.  

- **In 2-player: Does the loser act before the winner chooses?**  
  No. Winner picks a pair first. Then, the loser may pay 2 resources to steal either pair.  

- **Must all cards form a continuous map?**  
  No. Holes and disconnected sections are allowed.  

- **Are blue resource tiles lakes?**  
  No. Blue resources represent a resource type, not lakes.  

- **Can a square contribute to multiple scoring types?**  
  No. Each square can only be scored once.  

- **End of Game Scoring Card 5: Town square adjacent to 4 others and in biggest district?**  
  Worth 4 points (per ruling).  

- **Card 6: Empty production squares scored before or after factory delivery?**  
  Before.  

- **Is there an official draft variant?**  
  Yes—adopted from Hokkaido. Can replace standard Card Selection Phase.
