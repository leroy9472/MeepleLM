## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of the following steps:

#### 1. Draw Token  
- Current player (Town Crier) draws 1 token from the bag and announces its symbol.
- If it's a **Joker**, the current player continues drawing until a non-joker is drawn. That non-joker symbol is used.
  - After resolution, **all tokens are returned to the bag**.
  - Play passes clockwise; bag goes to next player.

#### 2. Assign Legions  
All players may deploy **1 legion** to an objective card matching the drawn token, via:
- **Mobilizing:** Place a legion from personal supply.
- **Redeploying:** Move a deployed legion from one objective to another matching the symbol.

> Note: Players may act simultaneously.

#### 3. Complete Objectives  
Any player who has filled **all spaces** on an objective may announce **“Ave Caesar!”**  
Resolution order: **lowest objective number first**.

For each completed objective:
1. Remove all legions from the card → return to supply.
2. Resolve the card’s **power** (immediate or permanent).
3. Move the objective to your **completed area**.
4. **Claim reward** (if eligible and applicable).
5. Draw a **replacement objective** from the public offering.
6. Refill the public offering from the draw pile.

> Note: Once announced, completed objectives cannot be targeted by negative effects.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I complete multiple objectives in one turn?**  
A: Yes, if multiple are filled. Resolve in order of **lowest objective number first**.

**Q: What happens if I miss claiming a Quantity Objective?**  
A: You **lose eligibility forever**. Must claim immediately upon qualifying.

**Q: Can I redeploy a legion to a card that doesn’t match the drawn symbol?**  
A: No. Redeployment must be to a card matching the **current drawn token**.

**Q: Can I use a completed objective’s power after the game ends?**  
A: No. Powers are resolved **at completion**. End-game scoring powers are evaluated during final scoring.

**Q: What if the public offering runs out of cards?**  
A: Refill only when a card is taken (via completion or replacement). If draw pile is empty, offering remains as-is.

**Q: Can two players complete the same objective type?**  
A: Yes, but only one may claim a **Color/Senator** or **Quantity** reward. Resource Control can change hands.
