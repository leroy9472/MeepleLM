# 1812 – The Invasion of Canada: Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In 1812, the United States declared war on Great Britain, leading to a campaign to invade Canada. Players take on the roles of the five military factions involved: American Regulars, American Militia, British Regulars, Canadian Militia, and Native Americans. The objective is to gain control of enemy Objective areas (starred cities or forts) and accumulate Control Markers. The side with the most Control Markers when the game ends wins.

### 2. Components
- Game map depicting American and British homeland areas, waterways, and Objective areas
- Colored units for each faction:
  - Blue: American Regulars
  - White: American Militia
  - Red: British Regulars
  - Yellow: Canadian Militia
  - Green: Native Americans
- Unit Force Pools: Reserve units not on the board
- Muster Areas: Designated zones where units are placed each turn
- Control Markers: Used to indicate which side controls an Objective area
- Round Marker Pawn: Tracks current round
- Turn Order Markers (including blank die for American Militia)
- Draw bag for randomizing turn order
- Two decks of cards:
  - Movement Cards
  - Special Cards (faction-specific)
- Battle Dice:
  - American Regulars & British Regulars: 2 dice each
  - American Militia, Canadian Militia, Native Americans: 3 dice each

### 3. Setup (Full Campaign Scenario)
1. Assign factions: Each player takes one faction (American Regulars, American Militia, British Regulars, Canadian Militia, Native Americans). With fewer than five players, one player may control multiple allied factions.
2. Place starting units as shown on the map.
3. **British Homeland Reinforcements**:
   - British Regulars, Canadian Militia, and Native Americans each place 4 additional units in any red British homeland area(s), with at least one unit per area.
4. **American Homeland Reinforcements**:
   - American Regulars and American Militia each place 6 additional units in any blue American homeland area(s), with at least one unit per area.
5. Shuffle each faction’s card deck. Each player draws 3 cards.
6. Place Round Marker on "1" of the Round Track.
7. Place American Militia turn order marker (blank die) on the 1st turn space. Place remaining four turn order markers into the draw bag.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of five turns—one per faction—determined by random draw after the first round.

At the start of each round (except Round 1):
- All five turn order markers are placed in the draw bag.
- At the beginning of each turn, draw a marker to determine which faction acts.
- After the faction completes its turn, place the marker on the next available turn space.
- Continue until all five factions have taken a turn.

An individual **Player Turn** consists of four phases:

#### 1) Place Enlistments and Fled Units
- Place new units from your Unit Force Pool into your Muster Area(s) as indicated.
  - **American Regulars & American Militia**: Enlistments go to Albany (unless modified by cards).
  - **British Regulars & Canadian Militia**: Enlistments go to Montreal.
  - **Native Americans**: One green unit must be placed in the Six Nations Muster Area; one additional green unit may be placed in any area already containing a Native American unit.
- All units in the Fled Units space are also returned to Muster Areas.
- If enemy units occupy a Muster Area, no units can be placed there and enlistments for that area are lost.

#### 2) Play Cards
- The active player **must play exactly one Movement Card** (including Truce Cards if no others are available).
- May play **up to two Special Cards** alongside the Movement Card. Effects can be used before or after movement.
- Special Cards that place units use units from the Unit Force Pool; if empty, use Fled Units (except Napoleon Defeated, which requires units in the Pool).
- Played cards are **removed from the game**, except Truce Cards, which are placed along the western edge of the map.

**Movement Rules**:
- An **army** is a group of units in the same area (can include allied units).
- You may move up to the number of armies shown on the Movement Card.
- Each army may move up to the number of areas shown on the card.
- No army or unit may move more than once per turn.
- To move an army, you must control at least one unit in it (you may include allied units).
- Movement stops upon entering an enemy-occupied area.
- Armies cannot pick up or drop off units during movement.
- Splitting units in an area creates separate armies (each counts toward movement limit).
- Multiple armies may merge into one area.

**Water Movement**:
- Minor rivers (black lines): crossable without boats.
- Lakes and large rivers (grayed-out sections): require Water Movement Card, Canoes, or Fishing Boats.
- Water Movement Card: allows armies adjacent to the same large body of water to move directly to any other adjacent area—even if enemy-occupied.
- **Canoes (Native American Special Card effect)**: Up to 5 Native American units from up to 5 different areas (on same water body) move to one area.
- **Fishing Boats (Native American Special Card effect)**: Two armies (up to 3 units each) from up to two areas move to one area (same water body).

**Out of Bounds**:
- Beige boundary territories cannot be entered.
- Islands in water bodies are not playable areas.

**Objectives**:
- Starred cities and forts are Objectives.
- When you control an enemy Objective, place your side’s Control Marker on it.
- If Fort Erie/Queenston is controlled by Americans, place **two** Control Markers.
- If your units leave or are removed from an Objective, remove your Control Marker; control reverts to enemy.

#### 3) Resolve Battles
- Occur whenever opposing armies occupy the same area.
- Active player chooses resolution order if multiple battles exist.
- Assign relevant Special Cards before battle begins.

**Battle Procedure**:
- The side whose **Homeland Area** hosts the battle rolls first (has initiative), regardless of attacker/defender status.
- Players alternate rolling Battle Dice until only one side remains.
- Each faction rolls dice equal to the number of its units in the battle, up to faction maximum:
  - American Regulars, British Regulars: max 2 dice
  - American Militia, Canadian Militia, Native Americans: max 3 dice
- Results:
  - **Hit**: Opponent removes one unit of their choice from the battle.
  - **Flee**: Move one of your own units (matching die color) to the Fled Units space.
  - **Command Decision (blank face)**: Move one of your units from the battle into an adjacent **Friendly Area**.
    - Friendly Area: empty or allied-occupied area in your or allied Homeland, or enemy-occupied allied area where a battle is ongoing.
    - Native Americans may move into unoccupied enemy Homeland Areas via Command Decision.
    - Units that moved via water cannot use Command Decision to move out by water.
    - Attacking side determines order of Command Decisions (e.g., Native Americans can open a path into enemy area before British units follow).

#### 4) Draw Cards
- Draw back up to a hand of 3 cards.
- If deck is exhausted, play with remaining cards.
- **Special Rule**: If a player ever holds 3 Special Cards, they must immediately reveal them, reshuffle into their deck, and draw 3 new cards.

**Allied Cooperation**:
- Players on the same side may show and discuss their cards freely.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Turn Order**: Randomized each round via draw bag (except Round 1, where American Militia goes first).
- **Unit Types & Roles**:
  - Regulars: Stronger dice limits (2 max), represent professional armies.
  - Militia: More dice (3 max), represent local forces.
  - Native Americans: High mobility and flexibility in movement and Command Decisions.
- **Card Play**:
  - Movement Cards define movement capacity.
  - Special Cards provide powerful one-time effects.
  - Truce Cards do not count toward the 3-Special-Card reshuffle rule.
- **Fled Units**:
  - Units removed by Flee results go to Fled Units space.
  - Return to Muster Area during next Place Enlistments phase.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End Check**: After Round 3 and at the end of each subsequent round.
- **End Condition**: Game ends if **all Truce Cards** of one or both sides have been played.
  - British Allies: 3 Truce Cards
  - American Allies: 2 Truce Cards
- **Victory**: The side with the **most Control Markers** on the map wins.
- **Ties**: Possible; game ends in a tie if both sides have equal Control Markers.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I play a Special Card that places units if my Unit Force Pool is empty?**
  - Yes, unless otherwise specified (e.g., Napoleon Defeated requires units in Pool). Otherwise, pull from Fled Units.
- **Can I move an army consisting only of allied units?**
  - No. You must have at least one of your own units in the army to move it.
- **Can I use a Command Decision to retreat into an enemy area?**
  - No. Only into **Friendly Areas** (defined above). Native Americans are an exception: they may move into **unoccupied enemy Homeland Areas**.
- **Does War Cry allow movement from non-adjacent areas?**
  - No. Only from adjacent areas. Up to one Native American unit from each adjacent area may move into the chosen area.
- **Can I use Fife and Drum with a Warship Movement Card?**
  - No. Fife and Drum cannot be played with a Warship card. Same restriction applies to War Hawks and Forced March.
- **Can I place units via Hometown Support in an enemy-occupied Objective?**
  - Yes. The card allows placement even in enemy-occupied areas.
- **Can I convert Canadian Militia to British Regulars after movement?**
  - No. Training card must be played **before** any movement occurs.
- **Can I use William Harrison to trigger a second battle?**
  - Yes. The victorious army may move into an adjacent area, even if enemy-occupied, potentially starting another battle.
