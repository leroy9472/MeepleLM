### 3. Setup  
**A. Route Setup (First Game)**  
1. Place the starting tile.  
2. Select and orient the 3 terrain tiles as shown in the illustration (may require flipping).  
3. Attach the 3 temple tiles as illustrated.  
4. Place 4 gems of matching color on each temple tile.  
5. Shuffle the 8 guardian tokens; place one face down on each guardian space. Return extras to box.  
6. Shuffle the 6 blockades face down. Place one randomly on each connection between terrain tiles, then reveal it. Return unused blockades to box.  
7. Final destination: treasure chamber (end of route).

**B. Player Setup**  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 2 playing pieces  
  - 1 expedition board  
  - Base deck of 8 cards (as listed above)  
- Shuffle your deck to form a draw pile.  
- Draw 4 cards to start.  
- The player who sat down first is starting player. They:  
  - Take the starting player hat  
  - Place one playing piece on starting space #1  
- Other players, clockwise, place one piece on next empty starting space.  
- In 2-player game:  
  - Starting player places pieces on spaces #1 and #3  
  - Other player places on #2 and #4  

**C. Marketplace Setup**  
- Sort all 54 expedition cards by type (18 types).  
- Place the 6 card types with ● symbol in bottom right corner on the market board (6 piles).  
- Place the remaining 12 card types face up next to the market board (not on it).  
- Place gold coin supply next to market.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has **3 phases**:  

**Phase 1 – Play Cards**  
Play any number of cards to:  
- **Move** your playing piece(s), or  
- **Buy** up to 1 new card from the market  

You may move first, then buy, or just do one. Cards used for movement must be played before buying.  

**Phase 2 – Discard Cards**  
Place all played cards (except those removed from game) face up on your discard pile.  
You may choose to keep unplayed cards (e.g. items, experts) in hand or discard them.  

**Phase 3 – Draw Cards**  
Draw cards until you have 4 in hand.  
If draw pile is empty, shuffle discard pile to form a new draw pile, then draw the rest.  

Play proceeds clockwise.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Movement  
- Path includes terrain types:  
  - **Landscape** (green jungle, yellow village, blue water)  
  - **Torch** (orange, cave areas)  
  - **Base Camp** (red)  
  - **Mountains** (black): cannot enter  
- Each space has a **power** (number of symbols) indicating difficulty.  
- To move onto a space:  
  1. Card symbol must match space color/symbol.  
  2. Card power ≥ space power.  
- Leftover power from a card can be used to continue moving (subtract used power).  
- You may stop moving at any time (lose leftover power).  
- Cannot combine multiple cards to move onto one space.  

#### Special Spaces  
- **Base Camp (red)**:  
  - Play **any one card** from hand.  
  - That card is **removed from the game** (not discarded).  
  - Useful for thinning weak cards.  
- **Mountains (black)**: Cannot enter.  
- **Occupied spaces**: Cannot move onto space with any playing piece (including your own).  

#### Buy New Cards  
- Spend card values to buy **one card per turn**.  
- **Card values**:  
  - Yellow cards with coin symbol: worth their power in coins  
  - All other cards: worth ½ coin each  
- Gold coins can be used in addition (see below).  
- Place purchased card face up on discard pile (enters deck next shuffle).  
- If a market pile is sold out, access cards from piles next to board.  
- Whenever there’s a vacant spot on market board, you may buy any face-up card (even off-board). If you do, place that pile on the board.  

#### Item Cards (× symbol)  
- Can be used **once per game**.  
- After use, **remove from game** (do not discard).  
- Exception: If played without using ability (e.g. for ½ coin), place above board, then discard.  
- Cards with black price: Can only be bought, not taken via effects.  

#### Blockades  
- Obstacles on connections between terrain tiles.  
- First player to attempt passage must **remove** the blockade by:  
  - Playing cards that meet the blockade’s symbol and power requirement (like movement), OR  
  - Letting each other player perform an action (e.g. draw card, remove card from hand, etc.)  
- Player who removes blockade **keeps it** (used as tiebreaker).  
- After removal, all players may pass freely.  
- Cave tokens or guardians behind blockades are inactive until blockade is removed.  
- You may continue moving after removing a blockade.  

#### Gold Coins  
- Max 3 coins per player.  
- Gain coins from:  
  - Guardian activation (others gain)  
  - Certain cards (e.g. Hunter, Gatherer, Treasure Map)  
  - Idle action: If you do **neither move nor buy** a card, gain 1 coin at end of turn (if <3)  
- Spend coins to:  
  - Move onto yellow landscape space with coin symbol (1 coin = 1 such move)  
  - Buy cards (any number, combined with card values)  
- Cannot use coins to pay for effects that require card payment.  

#### Guardian  
- When your movement ends adjacent to a guardian:  
  - If face down, **reveal it** (remains face up).  
  - **Activate** the guardian (no card needed). Effects apply to **other players**:  
    - Each gains 1 gold coin (max 3)  
    - Each may draw 1 card (shuffle discard if needed)  
    - Each may remove 1 card from hand (optional, return to box)  
  - **You** lose all your gold coins.  
- Guardian can be "reset": if you move away and stop on a non-adjacent space, next adjacent stop reactivates it.  
- Cannot be reactivated in same turn unless reset.  

#### Temple & Gems  
- Each temple has 3 spaces.  
- When your movement ends on a temple space:  
  - Collect **1 gem** of that temple’s color.  
  - You can only collect **1 gem per temple**.  
  - Place gem in front of you.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Game Trigger**: A player collects 1 gem from each of the 3 temples and reaches the treasure chamber.  
  - That player removes their piece to free space.  
  - Final round begins: all other players get **one more turn**.  
- After final round, game ends.  
- **Winner**:  
  - If only one player reached treasure chamber → they win.  
  - If multiple players reached:  
    1. Most blockades collected wins.  
    2. If tie: highest-numbered single blockade wins.  
    3. If still tied: player who reached first wins.  

#### 2-Player Game Rules  
- Each player controls **two pieces**.  
- Must reach treasure chamber with **both pieces** (after collecting gems) to win.  
- On your turn, for each card played, choose which piece it applies to.  
- Cannot split card power between pieces.  
- Pieces block each other (no stacking).  
- If both players finish on final turn, apply normal tiebreakers.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use multiple gold coins to move?**  
  No. Only 1 gold coin per turn can be used for movement (1 yellow space).  
- **Can I combine gold coins and cards for movement?**  
  No. Movement is either by card(s) or 1 gold coin (on yellow coin space).  
- **Can I use a card for both movement and buying?**  
  No. Each card used once per turn, either for movement or buying.  
- **What happens if I run out of cards during draw phase?**  
  Shuffle discard pile into new draw pile, then draw remaining cards.  
- **Can I keep cards in hand beyond my turn?**  
  Only unplayed cards (e.g. items, action cards). You may choose to discard them in Phase 2.  
- **Can I activate a guardian twice in a row?**  
  Only if you leave its adjacent space and return later (reset).  
- **Can I move through a blockade without removing it?**  
  No. Must remove it first.
