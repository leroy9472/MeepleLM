# Horseless Carriage – Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Players are industrialists in the early automotive era, competing to build the most profitable car manufacturing company. The goal is to maximize wealth by selling cars to buyers in a dynamic market shaped by evolving technology and consumer demand.

**Objective:** The player with the most Wealth at the end of the game wins. Wealth is earned by selling cars. Players must develop technology, build factories, and strategically sell cars before opponents.

## 2. Components
- **Main Board (Market Board):** 8×8 grid of market niches, divided into four price segments and four quadrants (I–IV).

## 3. Setup
1. **Board Setup:**
   - Place Market Board. Attach Spec Axes to read "0 1 2 3".
   - Randomly place two Research Tracks beside the board (X and Y axes). Point Obsolescence Marker at the X-axis track.
   - Place remaining 3 Research Tracks off-board in a column.
   - Place one brand piece per player on the first tech space of active tracks; on start space (left of first tech) for off-board tracks.
   - Place a Minimum Spec Indicator (wooden stick) between start and first tech on each track.
2. **Player Setup:**
   - Each player chooses a color and receives:
     - 1 main factory floor tile
     - 1 Research Department, 1 Planning Department (place immediately)
     - 3 Dealerships, 4 Marketing Departments
     - 9 Market Windows (3 sizes)
     - 17 Player Cards
     - 10 Brand Pieces
   - Place 6 Factory Floor Expansions per player nearby.
3. **Tracks:**
   - **Historical Focus Track:** Randomly assign players left to right.
   - **Gantt Chart Track:** Assign in reverse player order (last player gets 1, second-last gets 2, etc.).
   - **Wealth Track:** All players start at 0.
   - **Assembly Capacity:** All players start at 1.
   - **Punch Clock Marker:** Start at 8× player count.
4. **Market Demand:**
   - Draw (player count + 1) Neutral Buyer Cards. Place buyers in Quadrant I.
   - Place $6 Price Marker in the lowest (darkest) price segment.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each year consists of 8 phases:

1. **Research**  
   (Order: Highest Engineering Focus → Lowest)  
   Each Research Department = 1 action. For each:
   - Move own Assembly Capacity marker +1, OR
   - Move any player’s marker +1 on any Research Track.  
   → Cannot move same marker twice per turn.

2. **Set Focus**  
   (Order: Most Gantt → Least; tie: Highest Engineering)  
   Each player:
   - **Spend all Gantt** and place Focus Marker on any open spot, OR
   - **Pass** (keep Gantt and position).  
   → After all act: Fill remaining spots on Focus Track with passed players, preserving relative order.

3. **Build Factory**  
   (Simultaneous; conflict: Highest Engineering)  
   Players place tiles:
   - Any number, if placement is legal.
   - Must follow adjacency, access, and connection rules.
   → After placement: Add 1 Factory Floor Expansion (adjacent, Keep Clear unblocked).  
   → Move Focus Marker down to Historical Focus Track.

4. **Print Sales Brochures**  
   (Simultaneous)  
   - **Gantt Gain:** +1 per Planning Department (advance Punch Clock if passing clock symbol).
   - **Publish Specs:** For each Dealership:
     - Specs = sum of Spec Indicators connected to adjacent Mainlines.
     - If multiple Mainlines: use lowest spec per dimension.
     - If specs < Minimum Specs (all 5 dimensions): Dealership inactive.
   - **Market Window:** Based on adjacent Marketing Departments:
     - 0 → Small (2×1)
     - 1 → Medium (2×2)
     - 2+ → Large (3×3)

5. **Sell, Sell, Sell!**  
   (Order: Highest Sales Focus → Lowest; repeat until all pass)  
   On turn:
   - Choose active Dealership.
   - Place Market Window (if not already placed).
     - May overhang board; may overlap other windows.
     - Cannot cover any niche exceeding dealership’s specs.
   - Choose one niche within window with buyers.
   - Sell all possible cars (type and quantity limited by:
     - Buyer types present
     - Mainline types and remaining Assembly Capacity
     - Must sell all possible types if eligible).
   - Gain $ = Price Marker of segment + $1 (Truck) or +$2 (Sports Car).
   - Place sold cars on Mainlines to track capacity.
   → End: Remove all Market Windows and reset.

6. **Finish?**  
   (Admin)  
   Game ends if:
   - Punch Clock Marker has been flipped to "FINISH", OR
   - No Factory Floor Expansions were placed this round (Year 7).  
   → If not, continue.

7. **Advance Expectations**  
   (Admin)  
   - Remove Research Track pointed to by Obsolescence Marker.
   - Increase its Minimum Spec by 1 (move wooden stick, place/flip cardboard tile).
   - Move Obsolescence Marker to the other active track.
   - Choose new Research Track from off-board (excluding the one just removed):
     - Highest **Innovation** wins: sum of all player spaces ahead of its Minimum Spec.
     - Tie: Player marker furthest right → Topmost track.
   - Place new track and matching Spec Axis (starts at current Minimum Spec).

8. **Grow Demand**  
   (Order: Highest Engineering → Lowest)  
   - Each player plays 1 card face-down to any quadrant (card’s year number ≤ current round).
   - Reveal all cards:
     - Place Spark Markers as shown.
     - For each punch clock icon: advance Punch Clock Marker.
     - Discard cards permanently.
   - Generate Buyers from Sparks:
     - 1 Spark → up to 2 Buyers of matching type per niche.
   - Draw Neutral Buyers:
     - Quadrant I: (Player Count – 2) cards
     - Quadrant II: 1 card
     - Quadrant III: 1 card
     - Place buyers directly (ignore Spark limits).
   - Shuffle Neutral Cards back.
   - **Set Prices:** From top-right to bottom-left:
     - Assign $6, $4, $3, $2 to first four segments with buyers (skip empty ones).

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Technology & Access
- **Technology Access:** To build a Technology Station, you must:
  - Have your marker on or past it on its Research Track, OR
  - Access via patent sharing: If you are in position Z on Engineering Focus, you can use tech researched by the Zth player on that track.
    - 1st: any tech by anyone
    - 2nd: tech by ≥2 players
    - 3rd: tech by ≥3 players, etc.
- **Spec Indicators:** Each Technology Station must have ≥1 adjacent Spec Indicator pointing to it (matching type). Can add more later if accessible.

### Factory Placement Rules
- **General:**
  - Tiles must be fully on black grid.
  - Must connect to Loading Bay or another tile (orthogonal adjacency).
  - Cannot block "Keep Clear" zones.
- **Specific:**
  - **Mainline & Dealership:** Must be adjacent (mutual).
  - **Marketing Department:** Must be adjacent to Dealership.
  - **Technology Station:**
    - Must connect to Mainline via matching manufacturing step (A/B/C/D).
    - Must be unique in its manufacturing zone (connected group of same-step tiles).
    - Must have ≥1 Spec Indicator.
- **Floor Expansion:** Add one per round (if available), adjacent to factory, not blocking Keep Clear.

### Selling
- **Eligibility:** Dealership must meet Minimum Specs on all 5 dimensions.
- **Market Window:** Size based on Marketing Departments. Placement must not cover niches exceeding specs.
- **Selling:** Must sell all possible cars in chosen niche. Cannot combine dealerships.
- **Scoring:** Price Marker value + bonus: Truck (+$1), Sports Car (+$2).

### Time & Game End
- **Punch Clock:** Advances when:
  - Any marker lands on a punch clock space.
  - A card with punch clock icons is played.
  - When it reaches 0, flip to "FINISH".
- **Game End:** Triggered at Phase 6 if:
  - Punch Clock is flipped, OR
  - No floor expansions placed (Year 7).
- Game continues until Phase 6 even if clock hits 0 earlier.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Winner:** Player with most Wealth.
- **Tiebreaker:** Among tied players, highest Sales Focus wins.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I build the same Technology Station multiple times?**  
  Yes, but not in the same manufacturing zone (same-step group connected to same Mainline).

- **Can I add a Spec Indicator to an existing station later?**  
  Yes, if you have access to the tech and space.

- **What if two players tie in Innovation?**  
  Use rightmost player marker, then topmost track.

- **Do Neutral Buyers respect Spark limits?**  
  No. They are placed regardless.

- **Can a Market Window be rotated?**  
  No. Must align with grid (cards show orientation).

- **What if a segment has no buyers during price setting?**  
  It is skipped. Lower segments may get higher prices.

- **Can I sell fewer cars than possible?**  
  No. Must sell all possible cars in the chosen niche.

- **When does the game end exactly?**  
  At the start of Phase 6, if either end condition is met.
