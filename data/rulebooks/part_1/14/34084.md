### 1. Lore & Objective  
Witch's Brew is a competitive card drafting and role selection game in which players take on magical roles to gather ingredients, brew potions, and collect shelves and cauldrons to earn victory points. The goal is to amass the most points by the end of the game through strategic use of role cards and spellbooks.

The game ends when four Raven cards have been revealed. Players then tally their points. In case of a tie, the player with the most combined ingredients and gold wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game is played over a series of **Sets**. Each Set proceeds as follows:

#### Start of a Set:
- Each player is dealt 5 role cards.
- The remaining role cards are set aside face-down (unused for this Set).
- The current spellbook card is visible to all.

#### Order of Play:
1. The starting player selects a role card from their hand and declares: “I am the [Role].”
2. Play proceeds clockwise:
   - If a player does **not** have the same role card, they say “Pass.”
   - If a player **does** have the same role card, they may:
     - **Challenge**: Say “I am the...” — the previous player discards their card face-down to the unused pile, and the challenger now holds the role.
     - **Accept Favor**: Say “So be it!” — the previous player keeps the role, and the challenger immediately performs the **favor** (bottom action on the card, if possible).
3. This continues until no player challenges.
4. The last player to claim the role performs the **bold action** (main role ability).
5. The next player (clockwise) begins the next round by choosing a new role.

After all 5 roles have been claimed (or passed), the Set ends.

#### End of a Set:
- The top spellbook card is moved to the bottom of the spellbook deck.
- A new Set begins: each player is dealt 5 new role cards.
- The last player to successfully claim a role in the previous Set becomes the starting player for the next Set.

The game continues until **four Raven cards** have been revealed during Set endings. After the current Set finishes, the game ends and scoring begins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I use a spellbook ability if I don’t have the matching role?**  
A: Yes. The spellbook is available to **any player** who chooses to use the Grey role (Warlock) action.

**Q: Can I brew multiple potions in one turn?**  
A: No. You only brew once when you successfully claim a Blue role.

**Q: Can I take a potion vial when using OPTIO or MAGUS-type spellbooks?**  
A: No. When acquiring a cauldron via spellbook, you **cannot** pay an extra ingredient to gain a potion vial.

**Q: What happens if I have no ingredients when targeted by Begging Monk?**  
A: You contribute 0 (1/4 of 0 = 0). The player still pays 1 less due to Red card rule.

**Q: Can I use the favor if I don’t have the required resources?**  
A: No. You may only take the favor action if you can fully perform it.

**Q: Do unused role cards go back into the deck?**  
A: No. Unused cards from a Set are discarded face-down and not reused until a full reshuffle (if any). The game typically ends before reshuffling.
