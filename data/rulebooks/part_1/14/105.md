## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Eight fierce mythological creatures battle in a five-round gladiatorial tournament. Players act as gamblers, backing champions through strategic betting and influencing combat outcomes using creature powers. The objective is to earn the most gold by placing high-value bets on creatures that survive all five rounds. The earlier a bet is placed, the more it's worth—creating tension between early commitment and vulnerability to opponent targeting.

### 2. Components  
- **12 Creature Cards** (red-backed): Represent the combatants; 8 are used per game. Each has a unique special power.  
- **132 Combat Cards** (blue-backed): Numbered 0–10 for each of the 12 creatures (11 per creature). Represent strength in battle.  
- **11 Spectator Cards** (blue-backed): Neutral cards with values 0–10. Played on any creature; void special powers.  
- **3 Referee Cards** (blue-backed):  
  - **2 Prefects**: Take any visible combat card into your hand.  
  - **1 Magister**: Name a creature; all players with secret bets on it must reveal them.  
- **25 Bet Tokens**: 5 tokens in each of 5 colors (one set per player). Used to place visible and secret bets.

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player takes 5 bet tokens of one color.  
2. Select 8 of the 12 creature cards (by choice or randomly); place them face-up in a line. Set aside the unused 4 creature cards and their corresponding combat cards.  
3. Shuffle all remaining blue-backed cards (combat, spectator, referee) into a draw deck.  
4. Deal 8 cards face-down to each player. Players may look at their hands.  
5. Place the remaining deck face-down as the draw pile; place a discard pile nearby.  
6. Randomly choose the starting player. Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **5 rounds**, each ending when one creature is eliminated. Each player’s turn follows four phases:  

#### Phase 1: Place a Bet  
You may:  
- **Place a normal bet**: Put one bet token above a creature in the **current** combat row. Only one visible bet per creature per round.  
- **Place a secret bet**: Only in **Round 1**, before any elimination. Place a combat card (face-down) from your hand and put a bet token on it to secretly bet on that creature. **Skip Phase 2** this turn.  
- **Reveal a secret bet**: Turn over the combat card, show it, place the token above the creature card (not the current row), and discard the combat card.  
- **Pass**: Do nothing.  

> **Note**: You may make **only one secret bet per game**.

#### Phase 2: Play a Card  
You **must** play a card if able. If you placed a secret bet this turn, **skip this phase**.  

Play one of:  
- **Combat Card**: Play under its matching creature. Covers previous card. Cannot play on eliminated creatures.  
- **Spectator Card**: Play on **any** surviving creature. Overrides previous card.  
- **Referee Card**: Resolve effect, then discard.  
  - **Prefect**: Take any visible combat card (current or previous row) into your hand.  
  - **Magister**: Name a creature; all players with secret bets on it must reveal them.  

> **Creature Power Activation**: If you are the **backer** of the creature and play a **Combat Card** (not Spectator) from your hand, immediately use its special power.

#### Phase 3: Discard and Draw Cards  
- **Discard**: You may discard up to 3 combat cards of **eliminated creatures**, showing each to opponents.  
- **Draw**: If you have fewer than 8 cards, draw until you have 8.  
> **Exception**: If the **last card** is drawn from the deck, the game ends immediately (even mid-turn).

#### Phase 4: Check for Creature Elimination  
A creature is **eliminated** if:  
- All remaining creatures have a card (Combat or Spectator) in the **current combat row**, **and**  
- One creature has the **single lowest** combat value (ties prevent elimination).  

When a creature is eliminated:  
- Turn its creature card face-down.  
- Begin a **new combat row** below the current one.  
- Start the next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Bets & Payouts  
- **Visible Bets**: Placed above the current combat row. Value depends on **round placed**:  
  - Round 1: 4 gold  
  - Round 2: 3 gold  
  - Round 3: 2 gold  
  - Round 4: 1 gold  
  - Round 5: 0 gold  
- **Secret Bets**:  
  - Worth **5 gold** if the creature survives.  
  - Only one per player.  
  - Only placed in **Round 1**, before first elimination.  
  - Multiple secret bets allowed on same creature.  

> **Bet Timing**: Only one visible bet per creature per round. Bets cannot be placed on eliminated creatures.

#### The Backer  
- The **backer** of a creature is the player with the **highest total bet value** on that creature.  
- **Unrevealed secret bets do not count** toward backer status.  
- If tied for highest bet value, **no player is the backer**.  
- Only the backer can activate the creature’s power when **they play a Combat Card** from hand.

#### Creature Powers  
Powers activate **only when the backer plays a Combat Card** on that creature.  

| Creature | Power |
|--------|-------|
| **Amazon (Scouting)** | Draw 3 cards from the deck. If last card drawn, game ends immediately. |
| **Colossus (Endurance)** | Retrieve one of your bet tokens (even from eliminated creatures or secret bets). |
| **Cyclops (Stunning Blow)** | Choose a player. Randomly take half (round up) of their hand, place face-down. They cannot use these next turn. Return during their Phase 3. |
| **Daimon (Wealth)** | Place one visible bet (not secret) on any creature in **any row** that lacks a bet. Value equals original round (e.g., bet in Row 1 = 4 gold). |
| **Ettin (Multiple Heads)** | Play a second card this turn (extra Phase 2). Only once per turn. |
| **Gorgon (Stone Gaze)** | Choose a player and name a surviving creature. They must give you one combat card of that type. If not, show hand. Cannot give Cyclops-stunned cards. |
| **Magus (Foresight)** | In **Phase 3**, discard up to 3 combat cards (any creature, surviving or not). Stack and discard face-up without revealing individually. |
| **Seraphim (Clarion Call)** | Choose a creature **eliminated this game** and activate its power. If using Troll’s power, retrieve a **Seraphim** card. |
| **Titan (Steal)** | Choose player with ≥3 cards. Draw 3, keep 1, return 2. You may reveal contents, but not show cards. Cannot take Cyclops-stunned cards. |
| **Troll (Regeneration)** | Take one visible **Troll** combat card from any previous combat row into your hand. |
| **Unicorn (Teleportation)** | Swap any two visible combat cards of the **same creature** (even Unicorn). |
| **Wyrm (Fiery Breath)** | Discard one visible combat or spectator card from **another** creature in current row. New top card is revealed. |

> **Spectator Rule**: If a Spectator card is played on a creature, or a Combat card is played **on top of a Spectator**, the creature’s power **cannot activate**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when:  
- **5 rounds are completed** (3 creatures remain), **or**  
- **The last card is drawn** from the deck (immediate end).  

At game end:  
1. All players **reveal secret bets**.  
2. For each bet (visible or secret), if the creature **survived**, add its value.  
3. Player with **most gold** wins.  
> **Tiebreaker**: The tied player who took the **most recent turn** wins.

#### Stalemate Rule (Optional / Clarified)  
If no player can legally play a card and the current round cannot end:  
- Shuffle **all cards from Round 1 combat row** into a new draw deck.  
- Each player draws **1 card**.  
- Play continues; players draw **1 card per turn** (unless Amazon power used).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can two players have secret bets on the same creature?**  
  Yes. Multiple secret bets allowed.  

- **Does revealing a secret bet let me become backer?**  
  Yes. A revealed secret bet counts as **5 gold** toward backer status.  

- **Can I use a creature’s power if I play a card via Prefect or Unicorn?**  
  No. Only if **you play a Combat Card from your hand** and are the backer.  

- **Can I use Amazon’s power if I have fewer than 8 cards?**  
  Yes. Amazon draws 3 cards regardless of current hand size.  

- **Can I play a Spectator on a creature with a Spectator underneath?**  
  Yes. But power remains voided.  

- **What happens if I play Wyrm’s power and discard a card that was covering a lower one?**  
  The next card down becomes the current combat value.  

- **Can I use Seraphim to activate a power that requires a card (e.g., Troll)?**  
  Yes. But when using Troll’s power via Seraphim, retrieve a **Seraphim** card, not a Troll card.
