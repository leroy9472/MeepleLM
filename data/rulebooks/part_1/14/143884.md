3. Choose a starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn has three phases:

#### 1. Roll Dice  
- Roll **one die** at the start of the game.  
- Once the **Train Station** is built, the player may choose to roll **one or two dice**.  
- When rolling two dice, only the **sum** matters.

#### 2. Earn Income (Activate Buildings)  
All players may earn income based on the roll. Resolve in this order:

##### a. Red Cards (Restaurants) – 3, 9, 10  
- Activated when rolled.  
- The **active player pays** the owner(s) of matching Red cards.  
- If multiple players own activated Red cards, pay in **counter-clockwise order** (right first).  
- Pay only what you can; no debts. Unpaid amounts are forgiven.

##### b. Blue & Green Cards  
- **Blue (Primary Industries):** 1, 2, 5, 9, 10  
  - All players collect income from the bank.  
- **Green (Secondary Industries):** 2, 3, 4  
  - Only the **active player** collects income from the bank.  
- **Special Blue Triggers (7, 8, 11, 12):**  
  - Green cards that trigger on these numbers pay only if the active player owns matching Blue cards (e.g., Furniture Factory triggers on 7, 8, 11, 12 if player owns any Blue card).

##### c. Purple Cards (Major Establishments) – 6  
- Only the **active player** may use effects:  
  - **Stadium:** Gain 2 coins from each player.  
  - **TV Station:** Take 5 coins from one player of your choice.  
  - **Business Center:** Swap one non-Purple building with another player.

#### 3. Construction (Optional)  
- Pay to build **one** of the following:  
  - **One Establishment** from the supply (pay cost to bank)  
  - **One Landmark** (pay cost, flip face-up)  
- You may **not** do both.  
- **Restrictions:**  
  - Only **one copy** allowed per **Purple** building type (Stadium, TV Station, Business Center)  
  - Unlimited copies of Blue, Green, Red buildings  
- Landmarks may be built in **any order**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Income Activation Order:**  
  Red → Blue/Green → Purple  
  This ensures payments to others happen **before** collecting your own income.  
- **Multiple Copies:** Each copy of a building triggers its effect.  
- **Shopping Mall Effect:** Increases income from Bakery, Convenience Store, and Café by +1 each.  
- **Amusement Park:** Grants an **extra turn** if doubles are rolled (only when built).  
- **Radio Tower:** Allows **one re-roll per turn** (only when built).  
- **Train Station:** Unlocks use of **two dice**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition:** First player to **flip all four Landmarks face-up** wins immediately.  
- Game ends **as soon as** the fourth Landmark is completed.  
- No final scoring — it’s a race.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I roll two dice before building Train Station?**  
  A: No. Only after Train Station is built.

  A: Each copy pays individually.

  A: No. Pay what you can; remainder is forgiven.  
- **Q: What order do I pay multiple Red card owners?**  
  A: Counter-clockwise (starting with player to your right).  
- **Q: Can I use Business Center to take a Purple building?**  
  A: No. Only non-Purple (non-tower) buildings can be swapped.  
- **Q: Does Shopping Mall bonus stack with multiple Bakeries?**  
  A: Yes. Each Bakery gets +1 coin (so 2 coins each instead of 1, if Shopping Mall is built).
