## Cleopatra: Corruption & Auction-Less Variant

### 1. Lore & Objective  
This variant modifies the base game *Cleopatra* by removing the auction mechanic and reworking the corruption system to balance player actions and reduce randomness. The objective remains to accumulate the most talent points by completing monuments, managing priests, and reducing corruption—now with adjusted scoring and action rules.

### 2. Components  
- Base game components of *Cleopatra* (monument tiles, priest dice, corruption tokens, talent tokens, player pyramids, etc.)  
- No additional components required

### 3. Setup  
- Set up the base game as normal for 2-player or multiplayer mode  
- Use the Corruption & Auction-Less Variant rules from the start of the game  
- No auction track or bidding is used  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Players take turns in clockwise order  
2. On a turn, a player may perform standard actions (e.g., build a monument, recruit priests, etc.)  
3. When performing a **Build action**:  
   - Instead of rolling the Great Priest die and placing dice on the altar for auction, the player may **pay 3 talents** to roll all 5 priest dice  
   - Each **Ankh** symbol rolled removes **1 corruption token** from the player’s pyramid  
   - This ability can be used **only once per build action**  
   - Optional rule: Limit corruption removal to **1 per build action**, regardless of number of Ankh symbols rolled (to reduce randomness)  
4. Play continues until end-game conditions are met (as defined in the base game)

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Auction Replacement**: The auction phase is entirely removed. Player interaction shifts to strategic monument building and corruption management.  
- **Corruption Penalty**: At the end of the game, each point of corruption a player has results in a talent loss based on triangular numbers:  

| Corruption | Talent Loss |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | -1          |
| 2        | -3          |
| 3        | -6          |
| 4        | -10         |
| 5        | -15         |
| 6        | -21         |
| 7        | -28         |
| 8        | -36         |
| 9        | -45         |
| 10       | -55         |
| 11       | -66         |
| 12       | -78         |
| 13       | -91         |
| 14       | -105        |
| 15       | -120        |

- **Talent Calculation**: Final score = Total talents earned – triangular penalty based on corruption level

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- End game triggers as per base game rules  
- Final scoring:  
  - Sum all talent points earned during the game  
  - Apply corruption penalty using the triangular number table above  
  - Player with the highest resulting score wins  
- In case of a tie, standard tiebreakers from the base game apply (if any)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use the die roll ability more than once per turn?**  
  No. It can only be used once per **build action**, even if multiple builds are made in a turn.  

- **What happens if I have no corruption tokens?**  
  Rolling Ankh symbols has no effect, but the 3-talent cost is still paid.  

- **Can I choose not to pay 3 talents and still build?**  
  Yes. The player may build normally without triggering the die roll, as long as they follow base game build requirements.  

- **Does the corruption penalty ever reset?**  
  No. Corruption accumulates and is only penalized at the end of the game.  

- **Is this variant compatible with expansions?**  
  Yes, as long as the core auction and corruption mechanics are present.
