## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Caylus: Magna Carta is a strategic card-based adaptation of the classic worker placement game. Players act as nobles developing their estate by constructing buildings, influencing the Provost, and contributing to the construction of the royal castle. The goal is to earn the most prestige points (PP) through buildings, resources, deniers, and gold by the end of the game.

2. Components  
- 64 cards total:  
  - 4 sets of 12 player cards (1 set per player)  
  - 5 neutral building cards (pink)  
  - 8 prestige building cards (7 blue, 1 bonus)  
  - 1 first player card  
  - 1 bridge card  
  - 1 castle card  
- Resource cubes: Wood (W), Stone (S), Food (F), Gold (G)  
- Deniers (currency)  
- Provost pawn  
- Castle tokens (valued at 4, 3, or 2 PP)  
- Workers (used to activate buildings)

3. Setup  
- Place the Peddler card on the table. Shuffle the neutral building cards and place the appropriate number to the left of the Peddler:  
  - 1 player: 1 neutral card + Peddler  
  - 2 players: 2 neutral cards + Peddler  
  - 3 players: 3 neutral cards + Peddler  
  Set aside remaining neutral cards.  
- Place the Provost on the Peddler card.  
- Place the 8 prestige building cards face up to the side of the road.  
- Place the Bridge and Castle cards at the start of the road.  
- Remove Castle tokens based on player count:  
  - 1 player: remove 2 of each token (4, 3, 2)  
  - 2 players: remove 1 of each  
  - 3 players: no removal  
- Sort remaining Castle tokens by value and place them next to the Castle card.  
- Each player:  
  - Shuffles their 12-card deck and places it face down.  
  - Draws 3 cards.  
  - May discard all 3 and draw 3 new cards (only once; discarded cards go face up to personal discard pile).  
  - Receives: 2 Food, 2 Wood, 4 Deniers.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn consists of 6 phases:

**Phase 1: Income**  
Each player receives:  
- 2 Deniers  
- +1 Denier per residential building they own  
- +1 Denier if they own the Hotel  
- Draw 1 card if they own the Library

**Phase 2: Actions**  
Players take turns in clockwise order, each performing one action per round until all pass. Actions:  
- Draw 1 card from own deck: 1 Denier  
- Replace all cards in hand: 1 Denier (discard current hand face up, draw 3 new)  
- Place a worker on a building: 1 Denier (cannot place on residential or prestige buildings)  
- Build a building from hand: pay resource cost shown on card  
- Build a prestige building: pay cost and place on top of own residential building (see Build Prestige Building below)  
- Pass: end your turn. First player to pass receives 1 Denier.

**Phase 3: Move Provost**  
In passing order (order players passed), each may move the Provost ±1 to 3 cards along the road, paying 1 Denier per card moved. Movement can be in either direction.

**Phase 4: Activate Buildings**  
Activate buildings in order from first on the road up to and including the building where the Provost is located.  
- Only buildings with workers are activated.  
- Activation is optional.  
- Owner gains secondary benefit (O) even if building is not activated.  
- Primary benefit (B) only applies if activated.

**Phase 5: Build Castle**  
In passing order:  
- Players may offer batches (1 Food, 1 Wood, 1 Stone) to the Castle to claim the top Castle token.  
- If no player offers at least one batch, remove the top 2 Castle tokens (they are lost).  
- The player who contributed the most batches this turn receives 1 Gold cube.  
  - Tie broken in passing order.

Note: Gold cubes can substitute for any resource.

**Phase 6: End of Turn**  
- Move the Provost forward 2 spaces (or as many as possible if near end).  
- Pass the First Player card to the left.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Worker Placement**: Placing a worker (1 Denier) enables activation during Phase 4.  
- **Building Construction**: Pay resources to play building cards from hand.  
- **Prestige Buildings**: Built in 3 steps:  
  1. Build a Lawyer (from hand) and place a worker on it.  
  2. When Lawyer is activated, pay 1 Food to flip one of your buildings to its residential side.  
  3. In a later turn, build a prestige building on top of your residential building by paying its cost.  
  - Note: Lawyers never become residential.  
- **Provost Influence**: Controls activation range in Phase 4. Players can bribe to shift it.  
- **Castle Contributions**: Strategic batch offers to claim high-value tokens; risk of losing tokens if no one contributes.

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends at the end of the turn when the last Castle token is acquired.  
Final scoring:  
- Castle tokens: 4, 3, or 2 PP each as marked  
- Buildings: PP shown in top-right corner of each visible building card  
- Gold cubes: 1 PP each  
- Resource cubes (non-gold): 1 PP per group of 3  
- Deniers: 1 PP per group of 3

Total all to determine winner.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Gold Substitution**: Gold cubes can be used in place of any single resource (Food, Wood, Stone).  
- **Hand Management**: Replace all cards action discards entire hand face up; draw 3 new. Only allowed once per game? No—source says only the initial redraw is limited to once. Later replacements are allowed normally.  
- **Ties in Castle Phase**: Player who contributed most batches gets gold; tie broken by passing order.  
- **Residential Flip**: Only one building may be flipped per Lawyer activation.  
- **Prestige Building Placement**: Must be built on a player’s own flipped residential building.  
- **Provost Movement**: Can move backward or forward, up to 3 spaces, at 1 Denier per space.  
- **Activation Range**: From first building to Provost’s current location, inclusive.
