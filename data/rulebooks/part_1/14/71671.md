## THUNDERCATS: DARK ECLIPSE — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Mumm-Ra, the Ever-Living Source of Evil, has summoned the greatest enemies of the Thundercats during a rare planetary conjunction known as the Dark Eclipse. The Thundercats must work together to defend the Cat's Lair from advancing Threats.  

**Objective**: Prevent the destruction of Cat's Lair by stopping Threats from reaching critical zones. The Thundercats win if they deplete the Threat deck without triggering any defeat conditions. They lose immediately if one or more defeat conditions are met.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On a player’s turn:  

#### 1) DRAW A THREAT CARD  
- Draw the top card from the Threat deck.  
- Move the corresponding Threat token **one area to the right** (toward Cat’s Lair).  
- Apply the **Threat Effect** based on the zone it enters (see *Threat Effects*).  
- Place the card in the discard pile.  

> **Exception**: If **Grune’s Thundrainium effect is active**, drawing Grune again only advances his token — no effect is applied.  

#### 2) PERFORM THREE DIFFERENT ACTIONS  
Each action must be taken in a **different location** on Third Earth. Available actions:  

| Location | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Cat's Lair** | Challenge a Threat or Enemy to move it backward |
| **Kingdoms of Third Earth** | Move Snarf and/or recruit Warriors |
| **Shadowrealm** | Move 5 Warriors to a Kingdom bag |
| **Castle Plun-Darr** | Remove up to 5 counters from a bag; return Mutants to Castle, Warriors to bag |
| **Feliner** | Take 1 Ally token |
| **Cat's Paw** | Take Level 1 Equipment or upgrade to higher level (same color) |
| **Unicorn Forest** | Trade Warriors/Allies with one other player |
| **River of Despair** | Challenge an active or hidden Enemy |
| **Tower of Omens** | Move Tower Marker up OR spend it to trigger an effect |

> **Note**: Actions are limited to one per location per turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Challenges  
To challenge a Threat or Enemy at **Cat’s Lair** or **River of Despair**:  
1. Choose target (Threat or Enemy).  
2. Commit any number of your Warriors to Shadowrealm.  
3. Roll the die.  
4. Add die result + number of Warriors committed.  
5. Add Equipment bonus (if applicable).  
6. Commit any number of Allies from your stock to Feliner.  
7. Add number of Allies committed.  
8. If total ≥ target’s **Challenge Power**, you win.  

- **Win**: Threat moves **one area backward** (no effect triggered).  
- **Lose**: Nothing happens.  

> **Challenge Power** varies by Threat and zone. It decreases when moved backward.  

#### Threat Effects  
When a Threat is drawn and moved, apply its effect based on **Effect Energy** (determined by skull icons in the zone it enters):  

| Threat | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Shadowmaster** | Roll die → remove **Effect Energy** Warriors from the indicated Kingdom bag → place in Shadowrealm |
| **Warbot** | Roll die → add **Effect Energy** Mutants from Castle Plun-Darr to indicated Kingdom bag |
| **Mumm-Ra** | Draw **Effect Energy** Enemy cards → place face up on River of Despair (active) |
| **Spidera** | Roll die → place Enwebbed tile on indicated Kingdom; return Snarf to Rainbow Fields |
| **Grune** | Player **must spend actions** to overcome Thundrainium effect before doing anything else:<br>- Effect Energy 1: roll white, blue, or green<br>- Effect Energy 2: roll white or blue<br>- Effect Energy 3: roll white<br>Failure ends turn; next player continues attempt. |
| **Skytomb** | Move the Threat **farthest behind** (including itself) forward one space (no effect applied) |

> **Note**: No effect is applied when a Threat enters the **Control Room**.

#### Enemy Mechanics  
- Active Enemies (face-up at River of Despair) apply persistent effects (e.g., block actions, boost Threats).  
- Challenge an Enemy:  
  - Combat Power = 3  
  - Win: discard Enemy face-up  
  - Lose: Enemy remains active or in draw pile  
- When **all 4 Enemies** of a set are defeated, trigger the corresponding **Event**:  
  - **CATAPULT BARRAGE**: Move 3 different Threats back one space each  
  - **EYE-BEAM SALVO**: Move one Threat back 3 spaces  
  - **JAGA INTERVENES**: Take up to 15 Warriors from Shadowrealm and distribute freely  
  - **THUNDERCATS HO!**: Next 3 turns skip drawing a Threat card  

#### Tower of Omens  
- **Option 1**: Move Tower Marker up one space  
- **Option 2**: Trigger any effect at or below current marker level, then reset marker to bottom:  
  1. Defeat any Enemy without challenge (reshuffle pile)  
  2. Move one Threat back one space  
  3. Examine and rearrange top 6 Threat cards  
  4. Take 2 Warriors from Shadowrealm  
  5. Move Snarf to adjacent Kingdom (no recruiting)  

#### Thundercat Powers  
Each Thundercat has a unique ability:  
- **Cheetara**: Perform 4 actions (all in different locations); draw 2 Threat cards, choose 1 to play  
- **Lion-O**: Draw 2 Threat cards, choose 1 to play, return other to top/bottom of deck  
- **Bengali**: Recruit 4 counters instead of 3; add 2 Power per Ally (committed before die roll)  
- **Jagara**: Can predict Ally needs (exact power not specified in text)  

> Powers vary difficulty based on combination and turn order.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### DEFEAT Conditions (immediate loss):  
At the end of any turn, if:  
- ≥1 Threat in **Control Room**  
- ≥3 Threats in or past **Drawbridge** (i.e., in fortress or control room)  
- ≥5 Threats on or past **Drawbridge** (any zone right of drawbridge)  

#### VICTORY Condition:  
- Deplete the Threat deck.  
- After applying the last Threat’s effect and completing all actions, **none** of the defeat conditions are met.  

> Victory achieved through cooperation and strategic resource management.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you recruit in an Enwebbed or Frozen Kingdom?**  
  No. Recruitment is only possible in non-Enwebbed, non-Frozen Kingdoms.  

- **What happens if a bag has fewer than 3 counters when recruiting?**  
  Take all available counters. Return Mutants to bag, keep Warriors.  

- **Can Snarf move into a Frozen Kingdom?**  
  No. Snarf cannot move to a Frozen Kingdom. If already there when Frozen, may leave normally.  

- **Can you challenge a Threat in the treeline?**  
  No. Skytomb cannot be challenged until it moves beyond treeline. Others can be challenged once past.  

- **What happens if Grune’s effect is active and you draw another Threat?**  
  You **must first attempt** to overcome Grune’s effect using your actions. Only after success can you act normally.  

- **Can you use Tower effects if marker is at top?**  
  Yes. You may still spend the marker to use any effect, then reset it.  

- **Do Empowered Threat Cards trigger effects twice?**  
  No. Move the Threat two spaces, but apply the effect **only once**, based on the **final zone entered**.  

- **Can you take an Ally if Feliner is empty?**  
  No. Action is not available.  

- **Can you use Cat’s Paw if Mole Master is active?**  
  No. Mole Master blocks all Cat’s Paw actions until defeated.  

- **Do Threats trigger effects when moved backward?**  
  No. Effects only apply when moving forward via card draw.
