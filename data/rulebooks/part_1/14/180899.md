## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Ponzi Scheme, players take on the role of financial fraudsters running fraudulent investment operations inspired by Charles Ponzi’s 1919 scam. Players raise funds by claiming to invest in bogus industries, using new investor money to pay promised returns. The goal is to grow your virtual empire long enough to survive the inevitable financial collapse.  

Objective:  
Be one of the surviving players when another player goes bankrupt by failing to pay due interest. Survivors score points based on the scale of their industries and luxury assets. The player with the highest score wins.

7. Each player takes:  
   - 1 Time Wheel (Clock Board)  
   - 1 Time Marker (placed next to the arrow/hand space, between 5 and 1)  
   - 1 Player Screen  
   Place the Time Wheel in front of you with space to rotate.  
8. The player best at keeping their word becomes the starting player; give them the Start Player Marker.  
9. Game begins. Players start with no money, shares, or fund cards.

5. Core Mechanics  

Funding Phase  
- Starting with the Start Player and proceeding clockwise, each player may:  
  - Fund: Take 1 Industry Tile and 1 Fund Card, OR  
  - Pass (not allowed in Round 1).  
- To Fund:  
  1. Take 1 Industry Tile from the market.  
     - You cannot take a 4th tile of any industry unless via Clandestine Trade.  
     - Group tiles of same type in front of you; visible to all.  
  2. Take a Fund Card based on the number of tiles you now have in that industry:  
     - 1st tile → 1st Funding Row  
     - 2nd tile → 2nd Funding Row  
     - 3rd tile → 3rd Funding Row  
  3. Take cash from the Bank equal to the Fund Card’s value; hide behind screen.  
  4. Place the Fund Card on your Time Wheel at the number matching its payment period. Stack if needed, but keep details visible.  
- Restock:  
  - If fewer than 9 Fund Cards are on the board, draw to refill to 9.  
  - Rearrange by value: lowest three in first row, highest in third.  
  - If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form a new deck.

Clandestine Trade or Purchase a Luxury Good  
- Begins with Start Player, clockwise. Skipped in Round 1.  
Each player may:  
A. Offer a Clandestine Trade:  
  - The target player must share at least one industry with you.  
  - Choose a common industry. The other player cannot refuse involvement.  
  - Secretly place money in the Trading Envelope and hand it to the other player.  
  - The other player chooses:  
    - SOLD!: Takes the money and gives you one tile of the chosen industry.  
    - COUNTER OFFER!: Adds an equal amount of money, returns envelope, and takes one tile of the chosen industry from you.  
  - You cannot refuse the chosen response.  
  - All money involved remains private.  
B. Purchase a Luxury Good:  
  - If any Luxury Goods remain, pay its value to the Bank.  
  - Take the card/tile and place it in front of you (public).  
  - Only one per round. Cannot trade or sell.  
C. Pass.  

Pass the Start Player Marker  
- Current holder passes the marker to the left.  
- The new holder chooses and removes one Fund Card from the market.  
  - If it’s a Starting Fund Card, return it to the box (removed from game).  
  - All other removed cards go face up to a Discard Pile.  
- Restock the market to 9 cards using the deck.  
- Re-sort by value: lowest three in first row, highest in third.  
- If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile (excluding removed Starting Cards) to form a new deck.

Market Crash  
Trigger: If the number of Bear Fund Cards in the market ≥ number of players.  
When triggered:  
1. Remove all Bear Fund Cards from the market.  
2. Combine removed Bear cards, discard pile, and remaining deck; shuffle to form a new deck.  
3. Refill the market to 9 cards; sort by value.  
4. Starting with the new Start Player, each player must discard one Industry Tile:  
   - Must discard from the industry in which they have the most tiles.  
   - If tied, choose freely among the largest groups.  
   - Return tile to its market pile.

Advance Time (Turn the Wheel)  
- All players rotate their Time Wheel one space clockwise.  
- If Market Crash occurred, rotate two spaces.  
- When a Fund Card passes over or lands on "5":  
  - Move it to the arrow/hand space (due position).  
- Do not move the Time Marker; only rotate the wheel.

Pay the Interest  
- All players check if any Fund Cards are now at the arrow/hand space.  
- For each such card, pay the listed interest to the Bank.  
- If any player cannot pay all due interest:  
  - That player is bankrupt.  
  - The game ends immediately.  
- If all players pay successfully:  
  - Move each paid Fund Card to the number on the wheel matching its payment period (e.g., a card with "3" period goes to space "3").  
  - These cards remain on the wheel for future cycles.  
- Begin a new round with the Start Player.

6. Scoring & End Game  
End Condition:  
- Game ends immediately when one or more players fail to pay due interest.  
- All bankrupt players lose.  
- If all players go bankrupt simultaneously, no one wins.  

Scoring (for surviving players):  
- Industry Points: For each industry, score points equal to the sum of 1 + 2 + ... + n, where n = number of tiles in that industry.  
  - Example: 3 tiles → 1+2+3 = 6 points  
  - 2 tiles → 1+2 = 3 points  
  - 1 tile → 1 point  
- Wealth Points: Score points from Luxury Goods cards held (value varies; e.g., 4 points for a fountain).  
- Total Score = Industry Points + Luxury Goods Points  

Tiebreaker:  
1. Player with the most remaining cash wins.  
2. If still tied, player with the highest-value Fund Card (largest single fund amount) wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
Q1. What if someone forgot to turn the wheel or turned it incorrectly?  
- Use the Time Marker (fixed next to arrow) as reference. All players’ markers should align with the same number. Adjust any incorrect wheels to match.

Q2. How should I price a Clandestine Trade?  
- Use past outcomes: if your offers are often countered, your price is too low. If you always buy successfully, you may be overpaying. Adjust based on observed market behavior.

Q3. What if a counter offer has the wrong amount?  
- Inform the player privately. Return the envelope for correction. Do not reveal the amount to others.  
- If uncertain, retrieve your initial money, return the rest, and restart the offer.

Q4. Can I use a calculator or take notes?  
- Yes, but calculators do not guarantee success—many calculator users go bankrupt.  
- Notes are encouraged and can be shared for bluffing or analysis.

Q5. Can I have more than 3 tiles in an industry?  
- Only through Clandestine Trade. You cannot acquire a 4th tile via Funding.

Q6. Does a Market Crash trigger again if Bear cards still meet the threshold after restocking?  
- No. Only one crash per round. Even if Bear count remains high, no second crash occurs until the next round.
