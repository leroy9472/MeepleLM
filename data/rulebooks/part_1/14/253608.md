## 18Chesapeake - Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
18Chesapeake simulates 19th-century railroad development in the Chesapeake Bay region of the United States. Players act as investors buying private companies and public railroad shares, building track, operating trains, and managing dividends. The goal is to maximize personal net worth through stock appreciation, dividends, and cash holdings when the game ends.

The game ends immediately if a player goes bankrupt during emergency money raising. Otherwise, it ends when the bank runs out of money ("bank breaks"). In that case:
- If the break occurs during a stock round: complete the stock round and one full set of operating rounds.
- If the break occurs during operating rounds: complete the current set of operating rounds.

The winner is the player with the highest total value: cash on hand + market value of shares + face value of private companies (if game ends before Phase 5).

9. Randomize seating. Give Priority Deal card to first player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game alternates between Stock Rounds (SR) and sets of Operating Rounds (OR). The number of ORs per set depends on the current phase:
- Phase 2: 1 OR per set
- Phase 3–4: 2 ORs per set
- Phase 5–D: 3 ORs per set

The phase advances when certain trains are purchased:
- Phase 3: first 3-train bought
- Phase 4: first 4-train bought
- Phase 5: first 5-train bought
- Phase 6: first 6-train bought
- Phase D: first D-train bought

After each full set of ORs, a 2/3/4-train is exported (removed from the game).

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Private Company Auction
- Begins the game.
- Starting with Priority Deal, players clockwise choose:
  - Buy cheapest private at face value
  - Bid on a higher-value private (min $5 above face or last bid)
  - Pass
- Bids must be multiples of $5. Winning bidder pays bid; losers get money back.
- If a company is bought at face value while others have bids, resolve those bids immediately.
- After resolution, next player to the left of the buyer acts.
- If all pass consecutively:
  - If no sales: P1 (Delaware & Raritan) price drops $5, Priority Deal passes to first passer. Repeat until someone buys or P1 reaches $0.
  - If some sold: conduct one OR (privates pay revenue, train exported), then resume auction.
- Ends when all privates are sold and P6's associated company has par value set.

#### Stock Round
Players take turns starting with Priority Deal, proceeding clockwise. Each turn:
1. **Sell Certificates (optional):**
   - Any number of shares, in any order.
   - Constraints:
     - No selling in first SR.
     - No private companies sold to bank pool.
     - No President's certificate in bank pool.
     - Max 50% of a company's shares in bank pool.
   - Stock price drops one row per share sold (if possible).
   - Player receives current stock price per share.
2. **Buy One Certificate (optional):**
   - Pay bank:
     - IPO: par value
     - Bank pool: current stock price
   - Constraints:
     - Cannot buy a company's stock if sold it this SR.
     - Cannot exceed 60% ownership.
     - Must have certificate space (see below).
   - If buying President's share:
     - Set par value ($70, $80, $95).
     - Pay 2× par to bank.
     - Place markers on par and stock charts.
- **Certificate Limit:** Max shares a player can hold:
  - 2–3 players: 20
  - 4 players: 16
  - 5 players: 13
  - 6 players: 11
  - Shares of companies in yellow on stock market do not count.
- **Change of Presidency:** If a player owns more shares than current president (min 20%), they swap President's certificate for two 10% shares.
- **Company Floatation:** When 60% of a company's shares are sold:
  - Company gets 10× par in cash from bank.
  - President takes charter, places station markers.
  - Company operates next OR set.
- **End of Stock Round:**
  - Ends when all players pass consecutively.
  - Priority Deal passes to left of last buyer/seller.
  - For each company with 100% of shares in player hands (none in IPO or bank pool), stock price moves up one space.

#### Operating Round
Order: descending stock price, then rightmost, then topmost on stack.

Each company's turn (in order):
1. **(Optional) Buy Private Company:** In Phases 3–4 only. Buy from player for 50%–200% face value. Company may not sell privates.
2. **Lay or Upgrade Track:**
   - Lay one yellow tile, or upgrade one tile to next available color.
   - Must extend company route or increase city value.
   - First action: place home station (free), then lay/upgrade.
   - Pay terrain costs if marked.
   - Cannot build on private-owned hexes unless private is owned by a company.
3. **Place Station Marker (optional):**
   - One per turn on reachable city.
   - Costs: $40 (2nd), $60 (3rd), $80 (4th).
   - Home station placed free on first operation.
4. **Run Trains:**
   - Each train runs separate route.
   - Route must include company station, visit ≥2 revenue locations (cities, off-boards).
   - Max locations = train number (D-train: unlimited).
   - Value = sum of locations visited.
   - Cannot pass through full cities without own station.
5. **Distribute Earnings:**
   - **Withhold:** All earnings to company treasury. Stock moves left/down.
   - **Pay Dividends:** 10% of total to each share holder.
     - Player shares: paid to player.
     - Bank pool shares: paid to company.
     - IPO shares: lost.
     - Stock moves right/up.
   - Must do one or the other; no partial payouts.
6. **Purchase Trains:**
   - May buy if under train limit:
     - Phases 2–3: 4 trains
     - Phase 4: 3 trains
     - Phases 5–D: 2 trains
   - Sources:
     - Bank or bank pool: face value
     - Another company: any price ≥$1, ≤buyer's treasury
   - D-trains available after first 6-train bought.
   - In Phases 6/D: may trade in any train for D-train at cost of $700 (simultaneous exchange).
   - If purchase reduces limit, excess trains discarded to bank pool (no compensation) in operating order.
   - **Mandatory Purchase:** If company has route with ≥2 revenue locations but no train, must buy one.
     - If cannot afford, trigger Emergency Money Raising.

#### Emergency Money Raising
Triggered when company must buy train but lacks funds.
- President may contribute personal funds (max amount needed).
- Train from another company: price ≤ face value.
- If still short:
  - Must buy cheapest available train (bank, pool, or other company ≤ face value).
  - President sells shares to raise funds (chooses which/when to stop).
  - Cannot change presidency of operating company during process.
  - If still cannot buy train: player bankrupt, game ends immediately.
  - Bankrupt player's score = value of unsellable shares + face value of privates.

#### Train Export
At end of each OR set:
- Remove cheapest available 2/3/4-train from game.
- Triggers phase change if applicable (e.g., 4-train export starts Phase 4).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends if:
- Bank runs out of money: complete current phase's OR set (or SR + one OR set), then end.
- Player bankrupt during emergency raising: end immediately.

Final scoring:
- Player wealth = Cash + Market value of shares + Face value of private companies (if game ended before Phase 5).
- Company assets (trains, treasury) do not count.
- Highest total wins.
