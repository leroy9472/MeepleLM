## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Compete to become Master of the Hanseatic city-states during the 14th Century by criss-crossing the Baltic Sea in a merchant ship, acquiring valuable goods, and establishing market stalls in key cities. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) through strategic trading, selling, and city dominance.

### 2. Components
- 1 Game Board (depicting 9 Hanseatic cities connected by sea routes)
- 78 Goods Markers (6 colors; each color has: 4×1-barrel, 5×2-barrels, 4×3-barrels)
- 60 Market Stalls (15 per player in 4 colors)
- 1 Merchant Ship
- 22 Talers (coins)
- 4 Moneybag Tiles (to track player money)
- 5 Supply Spaces (on board, lower right)

### 3. Setup
- **Goods Markers**:  
  - 2 players: Remove all markers of 2 colors.  
  - 3 players: Remove all markers of 1 color.  
  - 4 players: Use all 6 colors.  
- Shuffle remaining Goods Markers face-down. Place 1 on each circular Warehouse Space (1 or 2 per city). Reveal all face-up.  
- Place leftover markers into 5 equal piles on the 5 Supply Spaces (in order: lower-left to upper-right).  
- Place Merchant Ship in Copenhagen.  
- Each player receives:  
  - 15 Market Stalls (same color)  
  - Matching Moneybag Tile  
  - 3 Talers (placed on tile)  
- Choose Start Player (important for endgame).  

**Initial Market Stall Placement**:  
In clockwise order, each player:  
1. Places 2 Market Stalls in any city (except Copenhagen).  
2. Repeats for 2nd and 3rd placements, each in a different city.  
   - Opponents may share cities.  
   - No stalls in Copenhagen during setup.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each player completes all 4 phases in order. Play proceeds clockwise.

#### Phase 1: Income
- Gain 3 Talers (add to Moneybag Tile).  

#### Phase 2: Replenish Goods Markers (Optional)
- If any Warehouse Spaces are empty, you may pay 1 Taler to replenish **all** empty spaces.  
- Fill spaces in numerical order (printed on board).  
- Take markers from the 1st Supply Stack; when empty, use 2nd, and so on.  
- **Mandatory** if no goods are on the board at the start of your turn.  
- Once triggered, **all** empty spaces must be filled.

#### Phase 3: Carry Out Actions
You may perform any number of actions, in any order, as long as you can pay for them.  
The Ship must be in a city to perform an action there.  
Only **1 action per city per visit**. To act again in the same city, move the Ship out and return.  
You may move the Ship before, between, or after actions.

##### Actions:
- **Move Ship**:  
  - Pay 1 Taler per segment.  
  - Move along routes in direction of arrows.  
  - Includes overland route between Tønsberg and Stockholm.

- **Purchase Goods**:  
  - Take 1 face-up Goods Marker from the current city.  
  - Pay 1 Taler to:  
    - The player with **majority** of Market Stalls in that city, or  
    - The **bank** if no stalls exist or there’s a tie.  
  - Free if you have the majority.

- **Set Up Market Stalls**:  
  - Discard 1 of your face-up Goods Markers.  
  - Place up to **1 Market Stall per barrel** shown on the discarded marker (e.g., 3-barrel → 3 stalls).  
  - No cost in Talers.  
  - Place as many as you can if limited by supply.  
  - No limit per city. Stack stalls for clarity.

- **Sell Goods**:  
  - Must be in a city where you have **at least 1 Market Stall**.  
  - Sell **2 or more** Goods Markers of the **same color**.  
  - May sell multiple colors at once, if ≥2 of each.  
  - Flip sold markers face-down (safe for scoring).  
  - Remove **1** of your Market Stalls from that city (only 1, regardless of quantity sold).  
  - **All opponents** lose **1** Goods Marker of each sold color (if they have it; choice of which to lose).

#### Phase 4: Taxes and Tolls
- You may keep a maximum of:  
  - 3 Talers  
  - 3 face-up Goods Markers  
- Excess Talers → bank.  
- Excess Goods Markers → removed from game.  
- Player chooses which excess goods to discard.  
- This limit **only applies at the end of your turn**.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Ship Movement**: Central to actions; movement costs 1 Taler per leg.  
- **Market Stalls**: Required to sell goods; also grant city control for free purchases.  
- **Goods Flow**:  
  - Start on board → purchased → used to build stalls or sold.  
  - Sold goods are flipped and safe; unsold are vulnerable to taxes.  
- **Player Interaction**:  
  - Pay opponents for goods if they control a city.  
  - Selling goods forces opponents to discard matching colors.  
- **Replenishment**: Drives game length; uses stacks in fixed order.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### End Game Trigger:
- When a player replenishes using markers from the **5th (last) Supply Stack**, the game ends after the current round (all players get equal turns).

#### Scoring:
Each player scores:
- **1 VP** per **unsold** (face-up) Goods Marker  
- **1 VP + 1 VP per barrel** for each **sold** (face-down) Goods Marker  
  - E.g., 1-barrel sold = 2 VP; 3-barrel sold = 4 VP  
- **2 VP** per city where you have **at least 1 Market Stall**  
- **+2 VP bonus (total 4 VP)** if you are the **only player** with stalls in that city (monopoly)  

#### Optional Expansion Scoring (if used):
- +2 VP: Most stalls in a single stack (highest single city?)  
- +3 VP: Player who triggered final round  
- +4 VP: Most cities with at least 1 Market Stall  
- +5 VP: Most sold goods of a single barrel type (e.g., most sold 1-barrel goods)  
- In case of tie for any bonus: **all tied players receive the VP**

#### Winning:
- Most Victory Points wins.  
- **Tiebreaker 1**: Most Market Stalls on the board.  
- **Tiebreaker 2**: Share the win (if still tied).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I move the Ship without performing an action?**  
  Yes. Movement is free to place; you may sail through cities without acting.

- **Can I act in a city, leave, return, and act again?**  
  Yes. Only one action per city **per visit**.

- **What if I can’t pay to move or act?**  
  You may still take Income and Replenish (if mandatory). Otherwise, skip actions.

- **Who gets paid when buying goods?**  
  - Majority holder in city → gets 1 Taler  
  - Tie or no stalls → pay bank  
  - You have majority → free

- **Can I sell just 1 good?**  
  No. Minimum 2 of same color.

- **Do I have to sell all goods of a color at once?**  
  No. You may sell 2 now, keep others for later.

- **What happens if an opponent has only 1 good of a sold color?**  
  They lose that 1 good.

- **Can I have more than 3 Talers or Goods during my turn?**  
  Yes. Taxes only apply at **end of turn**.

- **Does moving the Ship count as an action?**  
  No. Movement is separate.

- **Can I replenish if not all warehouses are empty?**  
  Yes, as long as at least one is empty — it’s optional unless board is empty.
