## BattleCon: War of Indines — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
BattleCon: War of Indines is a competitive fighting card game where players control powerful characters known as Fighters, each with unique abilities, styles, and finishers. The objective is to reduce your opponent’s life total to zero before they do the same to you. Matches take place over a series of Beats (rounds), during which players choose and resolve attacks using a unique card-and-token-based combat system.

   - Custom board layouts may be used (as indicated in setup notes).  

3. **Finisher Selection**  
   - Both players simultaneously select one of their Fighter’s two Finishers.

   - Each player discards one Style card face-up.  

5. **Fighter Setup (Advanced Fighters Only)**

   - Set the Beat Counter to the starting number (typically 6 or as specified by format).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A match consists of a series of **Beats** (rounds). Each Beat follows this sequence:

#### 1. Set Attack Pairs  
- Each player selects one Style card from their hand to form an Attack Pair (Attack + Style).  
- Cards are held secretly until Reveal.

#### 2. Ante  
- The player who was **Active** in the previous Beat goes first.  
- Both players place one Style card from hand into their Ante pile (face-down unless otherwise specified).

#### 3. Reveal Attack Cards  
- Players simultaneously reveal their Attack Pairs.  
  - **I. Reveal Effects**: Trigger any “On Reveal” effects.  
  - **II. Determine Active & Reactive Players**:  
    - Compare **Priority** values. Higher Priority becomes Active.  
    - Tie? Compare **Range** (lower Range wins Priority tie).  
    - Still tied? Active status flips from last Beat (or random if first Beat).  
  - **III. Resolve Clash (if necessary)**:  
    - If both attacks hit and would deal damage, both resolve fully (no cancellation).  
  - **IV. Start of Beat (SoB) Effects**:  
    - Active player resolves all SoB effects first, then Reactive player.

#### 4. Active Player Attack  
- **I. Before Activating (BA) Effects**:  
  - Active player resolves any “Before Activating” effects (order chosen by player).  
- **II. Check Range**:  
  - Attack must be within range to hit. Range may be modified.  
- **III. On Hit Effects**:  
  - Trigger if attack successfully hits (based on range and evasion).  
- **IV. Deal Damage (if any)**:  
  - If attack hits and has damage, deal damage to opponent.  
- **V. On Damage Effects**:  
  - Trigger if damage is dealt (even if blocked or reduced to 0).  
- **VI. After Activating (AA) Effects**:  
  - Resolve regardless of hit, miss, or damage.

#### 4B. Reactive Player Attack (if not stunned)  
- If Reactive player is not stunned, they resolve their attack using the same steps (BA → AA), with Reactive player now acting as attacker.

#### 5. Recycle  
- **I. End of Beat (EoB) Effects**:  
  - Active player resolves EoB effects first, then Reactive player.  
  - Includes abilities that trigger “at the end of each Beat.”  
- **II. Cycle Discard Piles**:  
  - Move all discarded cards to a temporary pile (not yet reshuffled into deck).  
- **III. Reduce Beat Counter by 1**  
  - When counter reaches 0, proceed to End Game.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Priority  
- Determines who becomes Active. Higher Priority wins.  
- If tied, lower Range wins. If still tied, Active status alternates.  

#### Range  
- Each attack has a Range value. Must be ≤ current distance to hit.  
- Distance starts at 3; can be modified by movement or effects.  
- Some cards (e.g., Flash Shell) allow movement.  

#### Damage  
- Dealt when an attack hits and has a damage value.  
- Can be reduced or prevented by effects (e.g., Stun Guard).  

#### Stun  
- A stunned player cannot perform their Reactive attack.  
- Some effects grant Stun Guard to prevent stun.  

#### Ante  
- Each Beat, one Style is discarded to the Ante pile.  
- Ante cards may be referenced by certain abilities.  

#### Finishers  
- Selected at setup.  
- Provide powerful alternate Base and Finisher abilities.  
- Replace default Base and Finisher.  

#### Unique Fighter Mechanics  
- **Rukyuk Amberdeen**: Uses Ammo Tokens; each Style consumes specific ammo.  
- **Tatsumi Nuoc & Juto**: Controls Juto as a separate entity; Juto has 4 life.  
- **Sagas Seities**: Uses Mirror Token to copy opponent’s attacks or effects.  
- **Zaamassal Kett**: Uses Paradigm Cards to shift abilities and stats dynamically.  
- **Danny the Sinner**: Summons Monster Tokens with unique effects.  
- **Robert the Saint**: Gains Blessing Tokens (Vis, Vox, Malleus, Sapiens) for passive bonuses.  
- **Ernie the Geek**: Uses Game Tokens to modify stats (Power, Priority, Range, Stun Guard).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition**: Reduce opponent’s life total to 0.  
- **Alternate Win**: If Beat Counter reaches 0 and neither player is at 0 life, the player with higher life wins.  
  - Tie? Compare total damage dealt during game (as tracked by players).  
  - Still tied? Sudden Death: play one additional Beat with no draw phase.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What happens if both players have same Priority and Range?**  
  - Active status flips from previous Beat. First Beat: flip a coin or random choice.  

- **Can an attack with 0 damage trigger On Damage effects?**  
  - Yes. As long as damage is *dealt* (even if reduced to 0), On Damage effects trigger.  

- **Does Stun prevent SoB or EoB effects?**  
  - No. Stun only prevents the Reactive attack. SoB and EoB effects still resolve.  

- **Can BA/AA effects be used if attack misses?**  
  - BA effects: Yes (they occur before hit check).  
  - AA effects: Yes (they occur regardless).  

- **Are Ante cards visible?**  
  - Typically face-down, unless a card effect specifies otherwise.  

- **When are Unique Abilities with “end of each Beat” triggered?**  
  - During Step 5.I (End of Beat Effects), after EoB effects of Active player, then Reactive.
