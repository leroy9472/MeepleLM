## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

**Rebel Objective:**  
Destroy the shield generator on Endor by advancing the Rebel Strike Team along the Shield Assault Track. Once shields are down, attack and destroy the Death Star (requires rolling a 6 on one die from an adjacent sector) to win.

**Empire Objective:**  
Destroy all Rebel ships — including X-wings, Y-wings, B-wings, the Millennium Falcon, and any fighters on Rebel fleet markers — before the Death Star is destroyed. The Death Star and Executor are not required for victory.

### 3. Setup

1. Assemble the gameboard and place all tokens and ships as shown in the manual.
2. One player takes the Empire role, the other the Rebels.
3. Each player shuffles their 30-card Order Deck and draws 6 cards to form a starting hand.
4. Place decks face down; create discard piles nearby.
5. Position:
   - Executor in designated starting sector with all undeployed TIE fighters
   - Rebel fleet markers with assigned fighters in starting sectors
   - Rebel Strike Team on the start space of the Shield Assault Track
   - Luke and Vader hit tokens at the beginning of their respective tracks

**4-Player Variant (Teams):**  
- Two players per side (Rebel Alliance and Empire)
- Shared Order Deck per team
- Each player draws 6 cards, plays 2 per round
- Play order: Rebel 1 → Empire 1 → Empire 2 → Rebel 2 (clockwise)
- Teammates may discuss strategy and show cards, but cannot exchange them

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow

Each round consists of three phases:

#### 1. Plan Assault
- Simultaneously, each player selects 3 cards (2 in 4-player) from hand and places them face down as an **Order Pile** (top = first order, bottom = last).
- Remaining hand cards are set aside until the next draw phase.

#### 2. Take Turns Giving Orders
- Rebel player goes first.
- Players alternate flipping the top card of their Order Pile and choosing **one** of the available orders to execute.
- After playing, the card is discarded face up.
- If a player earns **Bonus Orders** during the round, draw that many cards from the top of your deck and place them **face down at the bottom** of your Order Pile (to be played at the end of the current round).
- If one player still has cards after the opponent is out, they continue taking **back-to-back turns** until their pile is empty.

#### 3. Draw Cards
- Each player draws 3 cards (2 in 4-player) from their deck to replenish their hand to 6.
- If a deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck and continue drawing.

Repeat the round until a victory condition is met.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### A. Attack on the Death Star

**Movement Rules:**
- Ships may move into adjacent sectors only if the sector is **friendly or empty**.
- Cannot move into or through sectors containing enemy ships.
- The Death Star sector is impassable.
- Selected ships of the same type must all move to the **same adjacent sector**.
- Movement is **optional** and occurs **before** attacking.
- **Millennium Falcon** and **Executor** may move up to **2 sectors** in a single move.
- **TIE Fighters** may be **deployed** (4 new fighters) into the sector containing the Executor.
- **Fleet Ships (Rebel Fleet Markers):** Contain backup fighters. Activated via order, fighters may be moved to an adjacent sector.

**Attack Rules:**
- Attack from one sector to **one adjacent sector**.
- All ships of the selected type in the attacking sector may participate, even if they didn’t move.
- Maximum of **5 dice** per attack.
- Roll all dice at once; **attacker assigns hits** to enemy ships.
- **TIE Fighters** may attack immediately after deployment.

**Combat Resolution – Hit Thresholds:**

| Ship Type               | Hit on |
|-------------------------|--------|
| X-wings, TIE Fighters   | 3+     |
| Y-wings                 | 4+     |
| Millennium Falcon, B-wings, Rebel Fleet Markers, Executor | 5+     |
| Death Star (after shields down) | 6     |

- **Fighters & Fleet Markers:** Destroyed immediately when hit.
- **Special Ships (Millennium Falcon, Executor):** Have hit tracks. Each hit moves the token down one space. Destroyed when track is full.
- **Executor Destroyed:** All undeployed TIE fighters are destroyed.
- **Fleet Marker Destroyed:** All fighters on it are destroyed; flip marker to inactive side.

**Death Star Attack (Empire):**
- Must first target **face-up Rebel Fleet Markers**.
- Roll 2 dice; if **at least one die is 5 or 6**, the marker and all fighters on it are destroyed.
- Once no face-up markers remain, may target **any sector** to destroy all ships in it (including Millennium Falcon).

**Rebel Attack on Death Star:**
- Only allowed **after shield generator is destroyed**.
- Must attack from **adjacent sector**.
- Roll dice (up to 5); if **any die shows a 6**, Death Star is destroyed and Rebels win.

#### B. Shield Assault (Endor)

- **Rebel Order: Shield Assault**
  - Roll all 5 dice.
  - Each die that meets or exceeds the number on the **next space** of the track advances the Rebel Strike Team by 1.
  - If a Stormtrooper occupies the space, the target number is increased by 1.
  - When advanced onto a Stormtrooper space, **remove the Stormtrooper** and return it to the Empire supply.

- **Empire Order: Shield Ambush**
  - Place up to 3 Stormtroopers on the next 3 unoccupied spaces ahead of the Rebel Strike Team.
  - Each Stormtrooper increases the required roll on that space by 1.
  - Cannot place if no Stormtroopers are available.

- **Victory Condition Trigger:** When Rebel Strike Team reaches the end of the track, **shields are down**. Rebels may now attack the Death Star.

#### C. Luke vs. Darth Vader Duel

- Both characters have 4-hit tracks.
- **Redemption Spaces:** Last 3 spaces on Vader’s track (3, 2, or 1 hit remaining) are red.

**Rebel Orders:**
- **Luke Skywalker:** Roll 4 dice; each 4, 5, or 6 deals 1 hit to Vader.
- **Darth Vader Redeemed:** Can only be played if Vader is on a red space and Luke is alive. Destroys both Vader and Emperor.

**Empire Orders:**
- **Darth Vader:** Roll 4 dice; each 4, 5, or 6 deals 1 hit to Luke.
- **Emperor:** Deal **2 hits** to Luke immediately.

**Restrictions:**
- Cannot play Luke order if Luke is destroyed.
- Cannot play Vader/Emperor orders if Vader is destroyed.
- Cannot play Emperor order if Vader is redeemed.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

**Q: Can I attack without moving?**  
A: Yes. Movement is optional.

**Q: Can multiple ship types attack in one turn?**  
A: No. Only the ship type matching the order card may attack.

**Q: Can the Death Star attack a sector with only fighters (no fleet marker)?**  
A: Yes, but only after all face-up Rebel Fleet Markers have been destroyed.

**Q: What happens to fighters on a destroyed fleet marker?**  
A: They are destroyed immediately.

**Q: Can TIE Fighters enter the Death Star?**  
A: Only after Rebel ships have entered — they may follow, but cannot initiate entry.

**Q: Can the Executor enter the Death Star?**  
A: No.

**Q: What happens if I can't use an order (e.g., Vader is dead)?**  
A: You must still play a card and choose an available order. If no orders on the card are valid, the turn is lost.

**Q: Do Bonus Orders carry over between rounds?**  
A: No. They are played **within the same round** and placed at the bottom of the current Order Pile.

**Q: Can I re-roll dice?**  
A: Not in base rules. Some variants allow re-rolls based on duel lead.
