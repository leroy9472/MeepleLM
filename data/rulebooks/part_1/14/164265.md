## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Witness is a cooperative deduction game inspired by the Blake and Mortimer comic series. Players take on the roles of four characters—Blake, Mortimer, Nasir, and Labrousse—who must work together to solve mysteries by sharing hidden clues through a structured whispering process. The objective is to correctly answer three case-specific questions after collectively gathering and transmitting all available information. Success depends on accurate memory, clear communication, and teamwork.

2. Components  
- 1 Case booklet (contains case introductions and difficulty levels)  
- 1 Questions booklet (holds questions for each case)  
- 1 Solutions booklet (contains correct answers to all questions)  
- 4 Clue booklets (one each for Blake, Mortimer, Nasir, and Labrousse)  
- 2 double-sided Whisper tiles (used to track whisper rounds and direction)  
- 4 Character standees with plastic bases  
- 1 Yellow "M" standee with plastic base (used as a round tracker)  
- 1 notepad (for player notes)

3. Setup  
- Choose a case number from the back of the Case booklet based on difficulty (Beginner, Normal, Difficult, Diabolical).  
- Each player takes the Clue booklet and Character standee matching one of the four characters: Blake, Mortimer, Nasir, or Labrousse.  
- Players sit around the table, ideally in the order shown in the rulebook (character seating order implied but not specified).  
- Place one Whisper tile in the center of the table (either side may be used).  
- Place the Yellow "M" standee on the first square of the Whisper tile.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Case Introduction**: One player reads the case introduction aloud from the Case booklet.  
2. **Clue Review**: Each player privately reads their clue on the matching page in their Clue booklet. Clues can be reviewed at any time.  
3. **Whisper Rounds (4 rounds total)**:  
   - Players whisper simultaneously in pairs, as indicated by the Whisper tile’s current square.  
   - The whispering player shares **all** clues they know: their original clues plus any previously received clues.  
   - The receiving player listens but does **not** share their own clues in return.  
   - No questions may be asked during whispering; only requests for repetition are allowed.  
   - After each round, move the Yellow "M" to the next square on the Whisper tile.  
4. **Note-Taking Phase**: After the fourth whisper round, players secretly write down what they remember. No communication is allowed.  
5. **Question Phase**: Open the Questions booklet to the case page. Read each of the three questions aloud one at a time. After each, every player writes their answer privately. No discussion is permitted.  
6. **Scoring**: Open the Solutions booklet and read the correct answers. Each correct answer is worth 1 point per player.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Whispering Rules**:  
  - Only two pairs whisper at a time, as shown on the current square of the Whisper tile.  
  - Example sequence (based on provided example):  
    1. Nasir → Labrousse; Mortimer → Blake  
    2. Labrousse → Mortimer; Blake → Nasir  
    3. Nasir → Labrousse; Mortimer → Blake  
    4. Labrousse → Mortimer; Blake → Nasir  
  - Players must pass on **all** accumulated information during their turn to whisper.  
  - Whispering must be done quietly so the other two players cannot hear.  
- **Memory & Note-Taking**: Players must rely on memory during whispering; notes are only allowed after the final round.  
- **No Communication**: During note-taking and answering questions, all actions are done in silence and secrecy.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After all three questions are answered, compare each player’s answers to the Solutions booklet.  
- Each correct answer = 1 point. Maximum score = 12 points (4 players × 3 questions).  
- Team performance feedback:  
  - 12 points: “Old fellow! You've reached perfection!”  
  - 10–11 points: “Goodness! You almost had it!”  
  - 7–9 points: “Damn! Just a few small mistakes!”  
  - 6 points or less: “Devil! Share your clues and try the case again!”  
- The game ends after scoring. Teams may replay cases or attempt new ones.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I take notes during whispering?**  
  No. Notes can only be taken after the fourth whisper round.  
- **What if I forget a clue?**  
  Memory is a core mechanic. Forgotten clues cannot be recovered unless repeated during a whisper.  
- **Can I ask clarifying questions during whispers?**  
  No. You may only ask the whispering player to repeat what they said.  
- **Do I give my clues when I receive them?**  
  No. Receiving clues does not require you to give yours. Only the player whose turn it is to whisper shares information.  
- **Can we change the whisper order?**  
  No. The order is fixed by the Whisper tile and must be followed exactly.
