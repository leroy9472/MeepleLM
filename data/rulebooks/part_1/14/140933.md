## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are architects competing over three rounds to construct buildings that win Prizes and Awards. Each round, players build a structure using dice as building materials, attempting to fulfill both their hidden Blueprint and public Prize criteria. The goal is to earn the most points from Prizes, Awards, and Blueprint bonuses. After three rounds, the player with the highest total score wins.

### 2. Components  
- 32 dice (8 each in 4 colors: Orange/Wood, Green/Recycled, Black/Stone, Clear/Glass)  
- 24 Blueprint cards  
- 9 Award cards (3 Gold, 3 Silver, 3 Bronze)  
- 12 Prize cards (3 of each type)  
- 4 player screens  
- 1 scoreboard  
- 1 cloth bag  
- 4 scoring markers  

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Place all 32 dice in the cloth bag.  
2. Place Award and Prize cards in face-up stacks near the scoreboard.  
   - 3-player game: Use only Gold and Silver Awards; remove Bronze.  
   - 2-player game: Use only Silver Awards; remove Gold and Bronze.  
3. Shuffle Blueprint cards and form a face-down deck.  
4. Give each player:  
   - 1 screen  
   - 1 scoring marker  
5. Each player draws 1 Blueprint card and places it behind their screen, visible only to them.

6. Draw two dice from the bag for "In-Demand Materials":  
   - Must be different colors.  
   - If same color, return one and redraw until two different colors are shown.  
   - Place these on the scoreboard to determine tiebreakers.

7. Draw and roll dice for the initial pool:  
   - 2 players: 8 dice  
   - 3 players: 9 dice  
   - 4 players: 7 dice  
   - Sort by value.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game consists of **three rounds**. Each round follows this sequence:

#### A. Determine Turn Order  
- **Round 1**: The player who most recently visited a building under construction goes first.  
- **Rounds 2 & 3**: The player with the **lowest score** from the previous round goes first.  
- Play proceeds clockwise.

#### B. Build Phase  
On your turn:  
1. Select **one die** from the pool and place it on your Blueprint card according to Placement Rules.  
2. Draw a replacement die from the bag, roll it, and add it to the pool.  

Repeat until each player has placed **6 dice**.

**Two-Player Game Exception**:  
- After selecting your die, **discard one die** from the pool.  
- Draw **two** replacement dice (roll both, add to pool).

#### C. Placement Rules  
- Dice may be placed:  
  a) On an empty space of the Blueprint (hatched spaces are forbidden).  
  b) On top of a previously placed die **only if** the die below has a **value equal to or less than** the die being placed (e.g., a 3 can go on 1, 2, or 3).  
- If a die cannot be legally placed, it is **removed from play**.  
- Once placed, a die **cannot be moved or rerolled**.  
- Die values **cannot be changed** after rolling.

#### D. Scoring Phase  
After all players have placed 6 dice:

##### i. Blueprint Bonus  
- Any player whose building **exactly matches** their Blueprint card (correct die positions, heights, and values) scores **6 points**.

##### ii. Materials Scoring  
Score each material type across all buildings before moving to the next:

- **Orange (Wood)**: Each orange die scores **2 points per adjacent die** (sharing a face). Scored individually.  
- **Green (Recycled)**: Total score based on number of green dice used:  
  - 1: 2 pts  
  - 2: 5 pts  
  - 3: 10 pts  
  - 4: 15 pts  
  - 5: 20 pts  
  - 6: 30 pts  
- **Black (Stone)**: Each black die scores based on **level** (stack height):  
  - 1st level (bottom): 2 pts  
  - 2nd level: 3 pts  
  - 3rd level: 5 pts  
  - 4th level or higher: 8 pts  
- **Clear (Glass)**: Each clear die scores **the value shown on its top face**, regardless of being covered.

Update scores on the scoreboard.

##### iii. Awards  
Award cards are distributed based on performance in each category. Specific award criteria are not listed in the source, but scoring is done per material type and likely corresponds to top performers.

##### iv. Prizes  
One of each Prize type is awarded per round. A building may win multiple Prizes. Criteria:

- **Skyscraper Prize**: Building has a **height of 5 or greater** (stack of 5+ dice).  
- **Structural Integrity Prize**: Building includes **4 or more dice with the same value**.  
- **Geometry's Prize**: Building includes dice showing **all values 1 through 6**.  
- **Materials Prize**: Building includes **5 or more dice of the same color**.

If no building meets a Prize’s criteria, it is **not awarded**.  
If multiple players qualify, use **In-Demand Materials** to break ties:  
1. Compare number of dice in the **first in-demand color**.  
2. If still tied, compare the **second in-demand color**.  
3. If still tied, the player who acted **later in turn order** wins.

##### v. Tiebreaking for Awards  
Same as for Prizes: use In-Demand Materials (first, then second), then turn order (last player wins).

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Dice as Materials**: Each color represents a material with unique scoring.  
- **Blueprint Matching**: Exact replication yields 6-point bonus.  
- **Stacking Rules**: Dice can only stack on equal or lower values.  
- **In-Demand Materials**: Two randomly drawn colored dice break ties.  
- **Hidden Information**: Blueprints are private; Prize and Award cards are kept face down until game end.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After three rounds:  
1. Reveal all Award and Prize cards.  
2. Sum total points (each card has a point value in the upper-left corner).  
3. Player with highest total wins.

**Tiebreakers (in order):**  
1. Most **Prizes**  
2. Most **Gold Awards**  
3. Most **Silver Awards**  
4. Most **Bronze Awards**  
5. If still tied: **share the victory**

**End of Round Procedure (for rounds 1–2):**  
- Return all dice to the bag  
- Discard used Blueprint cards  
- Remove scoring markers from scoreboard  
- Begin new round
