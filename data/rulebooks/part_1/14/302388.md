# Back to the Future: Back in Time – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
It's October 1985—until Doc Brown’s DeLorean time machine sends players back to 1955. You must ensure George McFly and Lorraine Baines fall in love to secure Marty McFly’s existence. Then, drive the DeLorean to 88 mph on Hill Valley’s Main Street at precisely 10:04 p.m., when a lightning strike powers the flux capacitor and sends the DeLorean back to 1985.

**Game Objective:**  
This is a cooperative game—players win or lose together. To win, two conditions must be met when lightning strikes at 10:04 p.m.:

- **George and Lorraine are in love:**  
  The Love Meter Cube must be in the Heart Zone (one of the three heart-marked spaces), and at least one McFly Photo section must be face-up.

- **The DeLorean is ready for time travel:**  
  The DeLorean Mover must be in one of the three highlighted spaces of the Ready Zone on Main Street.

> ⚠️ **Important:** The game does NOT end the moment these conditions are met. Players must survive until the final turn (10:04 p.m.), and both conditions must still be true when lightning strikes.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn has two phases:

#### 1. Turn Tracker Phase (except first player’s first turn)
Move the Turn Tracker Cube one space right. Resolve all icons in the column **top to bottom**:

- **Draw New Trouble Card (Level 1, 2, or 3):**  
  Reveal top card of the specified Trouble Deck. Place it face-up at the location shown. Activate its effect immediately. Remove any previously unresolved Trouble Card.

- **Draw New Movement Card(s):**  
  Reveal top Movement Card. Move George, Lorraine, and Biff as shown, in order.  
  If icon has ×2, draw and resolve two cards.

- **Check Love Meter:**  
  - If Love Meter Cube is in 0–12: Flip **1** McFly Photo section face-down.  
  - If in Double Photo Zone (negative spaces): Flip **2** sections face-down.  
  - If in Heart Zone: No flip.  
  - If icon has ×2: Perform check **twice** (flip 2 or 4 sections).  
  > If the last photo section is flipped face-down → Marty disappears → **immediate loss**.

#### 2. Action Phase
During this phase, the active player may:

- Move up to 6 spaces using Power Tiles
- Attempt Challenges
- Modify Die Rolls
- Use Item Cards
- Use Special Character Power (once per turn)

Actions may be performed in any order. After using a Power Tile, flip it face-down (exhausted). It refreshes at end of turn.

---

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Moving Your Character
- Use a Power Tile to move up to the number of spaces shown (max 6).
- Diagonal spaces are not adjacent.
- Movement ends if you stop to take an action.
- Use another Power Tile to continue moving.

#### Escorting George and Lorraine
- While moving, you may escort **one** of George or Lorraine.
- You may pick them up or drop them off during movement.
- Cannot escort through or into Town Square.

#### Special Character Powers (use once per turn, no Power Tile needed)
- **Marty McFly – "This Is Heavy!":** Move Lorraine up to 2 spaces toward you. (Not through Town Square.)
- **Doc Brown – "Great Scott!":** Move to DeLorean’s location. (Cannot escort during this move.)
- **Jennifer Parker – "Follow Me!":** Move Marty, Doc, or Einstein up to 2 spaces toward you.
- **Einstein – "Bark! Bark!":** If Biff is within 1 space, move Biff up to 2 spaces in any direction. (Not through Town Square.)

#### Challenge Types
To attempt a challenge, you must be at the correct location.

| Challenge | Requirement | Resolution |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Influence Love** | At same location as **both George and Lorraine** | For each **Love ♥ or Wild**, move Love Meter up 1 space. |
| **Move DeLorean** | At same location as **DeLorean** | For each **Speed ⚡ or Wild**, move DeLorean 1 spot forward. To move past Doc’s House, you must have all 3 DeLorean Parts. |
| **Fight Biff** | At same location as **Biff** (who is **not** knocked down) | Roll **1 Courage ♦ or Wild** to knock Biff down. For each additional ♦ or Wild, place 1 Knockdown Token (max 3). |
| **Prepare DeLorean** | At same location as a **DeLorean Part Tile** | Roll required number of **Knowledge 🔍 or Wild** symbols (shown on tile) to obtain the part. Flip tile and place at Doc’s House. |
| **Opportunity Challenge** | At same location as **Opportunity Card** + any character requirement met | Roll required symbol(s). If successful, gain reward (Power Tile, Item Card, etc.). Discard card and draw a new one to replace it. |
| **Trouble Challenge** | At same location as **Trouble Card** | Roll required symbol(s). If successful, gain reward. Discard card. **Do not draw a replacement.** |

> **Note:** Only one Trouble Card is ever active.

#### Rolling Dice for Challenges
1. **Choose dice** based on face-up Power Tiles. Max 2 dice per color.
2. **Exhaust Power Tiles** used to contribute dice.
3. **Roll all selected dice.**
4. **Step-by-step resolution:**
   - **1. Lock Biffs:** Set aside all ⭕ dice. These cannot be rerolled.
   - **2. Reroll (optional):** Reroll any unlocked dice. Any ⭕ rolled must be locked.
   - **3. Modify Die Rolls:** Use Power Tiles or Item Cards (e.g., Reroll All, Change to Wild).
   - **4. Resolve Advantages:** Apply challenge results (e.g., move Love Meter, move DeLorean).
   - **5. Resolve Biff Dice (⭕):**  
     - Move Biff 1 space toward nearest of George/Lorraine.  
     - If Biff is already with one or both, each ⭕ lowers Love Meter by 1.  
     - If Biff is **knocked down**, each ⭕ removes 1 Knockdown Token. When tokens are gone, next ⭕ stands him up.

> Wild (⭐) = any symbol.

#### Assisting Other Players
- Players at same location may assist.
- Assisting players may:
  - Exhaust Power Tiles to roll dice
  - Use Power Tiles or Item Cards to modify rolls
- Active player must roll at least 1 die.
- All assisting Power Tiles/Item Cards are exhausted and unavailable until **after** assisting player’s next turn.
- Rewards go to **active player only**.

#### Item Cards
- Gained from resolving Opportunity or Trouble Challenges.
- Placed **face-down** when acquired (cannot be used that turn).
- May be used **once per turn**; flip face-down after use (except Backpack).
- **Backpack:** Allows holding 2 extra Power Tiles (max 10). Never exhausted.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends in one of two ways:

1. **Instant Loss:**  
   The sixth McFly Photo section is flipped face-down → Marty ceases to exist → **players lose immediately**.

2. **Final Turn (10:04 p.m.):**  
   When Turn Tracker Cube reaches final space:
   - **Win:** Love Meter Cube is in Heart Zone **AND** DeLorean is in Ready Zone.
   - **Lose:** Either condition fails.

> The game continues until 10:04 p.m., even if objectives are met early.

A: Yes. Biff remains knocked down and keeps tokens.
