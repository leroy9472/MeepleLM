## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the enchanted land of Brew, the seasons exist simultaneously and day-night cycles rotate unpredictably. Players take on the role of mystics striving to restore balance by gathering ingredients, claiming forests, training magical creatures, and brewing powerful potions. The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the game through these actions.

2. Components  
- 1 Village board (Day/Night sides)  
- 1 First player marker  
- 4 Character boards  
- 16 Forage dice (4 per player)  
- 8 Element dice (2 per player)  
- 20 Forest cards  
- 36 Creature cards (sorted by season: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)  
- 32 Potion cards  
- 4 Reference cards  
- 96 Ingredient tokens:  
  - 24 Herbs

3. Setup  
1. Place the Village board in the center with the Day side faceup.  
2. Remove Forest cards not matching player count; shuffle and place face-down as a deck.  
3. Reveal Forest cards equal to player count to form the Forest row.  
4. Shuffle Potion cards; place face-down as a draw pile. Reveal 4 to form the Potion market.  
5. Create supply piles: ingredients, VP tokens, scorch tokens.  
6. Sort Creature cards into 4 season-based faceup piles; place next to the board.  
7. Each player chooses or is randomly dealt a Character board.  
8. Players collectively decide whether to use Character powers (all use powers or none do).  
9. Each player takes:  
   - 4 Forage dice in their color  
   - 2 white Element dice  
   - 1 Energy Berry  
   - 1 reference card  
10. Assign the first player marker (e.g., last person to brew tea).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
- The game lasts 4 rounds.  
- At the start of each round:  
  - All players roll all 6 dice (4 Forage, 2 Element).  
  - Players take turns clockwise, starting with the first player.  
- Each turn consists of:  
  1. **Place 1 die** (mandatory)  
  2. **Brew 1 Potion** (optional)  
  3. **Drink 1 Potion** (optional)  
- Actions may be taken in any order.  
- Once all players have no dice left, the round ends.  
- End of round steps:  
  - Claim forests (if controlled)  
  - Use end-of-round creature powers  
  - Check game end condition  
  - Retrieve dice, flip Village board, reveal new Forest row, pass first player marker  

5. Core Mechanics  
**Die Placement Rules:**  
- A Forage die can be placed on a matching ingredient space or Creature space in a Forest.  
- An Element die can be placed on any ingredient/Creature space in a Forest or on matching Element spot in the Village.  
- Top two "Any die" spaces on the Village board can accept any die and cannot be blocked.  
- Only one die per space unless powers allow stacking.  

**Gathering Ingredients:**  
- Placing any die on an ingredient space grants 1 of that ingredient.  
- Water Element die in a Forest grants +2 (total 3) of the ingredient.  

**Training Creatures:**  
- Place any die on a Creature space to train a creature.  
- Choose one from the top of any season pile.  
- Maximum 3 trained creatures; training a 4th requires releasing one.  

**Controlling Forests:**  
A player controls a Forest at round end if:  
- They have more Forage dice than each other player individually, **AND**  
- Their Forage dice outnumber total Element dice in the Forest.  
- Ties mean no control. Element dice (even your own) count against control.  

**Element Dice Powers (used when placed in Forests):**  
- **Water**: Gather +2 of the ingredient (3 total).  
- **Fire**: Place on top of any die (yours or opponent’s); covered die no longer counts for control.  
- **Wind**: Return one of your Forage dice from a Forest space to your pool; gather/train normally.  

**Forcing Dice:**  
- Spend matching ingredient or 1 Energy Berry to place a Forage die on a non-matching space.  
- No gathering/training occurs. Only applies to ingredient/Creature spaces.  

**Scorching:**  
- Some powers allow placing a scorch token on an empty Forest space.  
- Scorched spaces are unusable and ignored for control.  

**Potion Mechanics:**  
- **Brewing**: Pay ingredients to take a Potion from market or reservation.  
- **Reserving**: Reveal top Potion deck card; reserve it or swap with one from market.  
- **Drinking**: Use once per Potion; resolve effect and tuck behind character board.  
- Reserved Potions cost same, only you can brew them.  

**Creature Release & Scoring:**  
- Released creatures score 1 VP.  
- If released into a matching-season claimed Forest, score 3 VP.  
- Each Forest accepts only one creature.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Final scoring includes:  
- **Brewed Potions**: Score VP on all brewed (drunk or in hand).  
- **Claimed Forests**: Sum VP on all claimed Forest cards.  
- **Released Creatures**: 3 VP if in matching Forest, 1 VP otherwise.  
- **VP Tokens**: Total VP collected during game.  
- **Leftover Ingredients**: 1 VP per 3 ingredients (round down; includes Energy Berries).  
- **Tiebreaker**: Most leftover ingredients wins; if still tied, share victory.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I brew/drink with no dice left?** No. Must have at least one die to perform either action.  
- **Can I use Element powers in the Village?** No. Only in Forests.  
- **Can I stack more than two dice?** Yes. Only the top die counts for control.  
- **Can I scorch a space with a die?** No. Only empty spaces.  
- **Can I return a die from a scorch space?** No. Scorched spaces are inactive.  
- **Do I gather when using Wind to return a die?** Yes. You still gather/train from the space.  
- **Can I place on a blocked Village Element space?** No. Only top two "Any die" spaces are unblockable.  
- **What happens to dice on a released Creature?** Set aside until end of round; not usable.
