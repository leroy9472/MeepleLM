   - On the coal space matching the player count, place 2 coal tokens per player; continue placing 2 per player on each lower coal space.  
3. **Token Supplies**:  
   - Shuffle gold tokens face-down.  
   - Place coal, whistle, and resource tokens in supply near the board.  
4. **Shares**: Sort railroad shares by type; stack each in numerical order (1 on top).  
5. **Upgrades (Cogs)**:

     - 7 in the rightmost column.  
     - 1 each at top and bottom of the second column from right.  
   - Tiles must not create a route that only goes backward.

   - Reveal 3 face-up next to the stack.  
10. **Player Setup**:  
    - Each player draws 1 whistle token and 3 random tiles.  
    - Must have at least one tile with a stop; if not, discard and draw until one is obtained.  
    - Choose color; take trains:  
      - 2–3 players: 5 trains  
      - 4 players: 4 trains  
      - 5 players: 3 trains

    - Each East Coast stop holds at most one train.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Game lasts **9/10/11/12 rounds** in **5/4/3/2-player** games.  
- **Start of Round**:  
  - Start player takes all tokens from the next space on the turn track and distributes evenly to all players (each gets 1 whistle or 2 coal).  
- **Player Turns**:  
  - Proceed clockwise. On your turn:  
    - Spend up to 4 tokens (coal or whistle) on actions (movement, upgrades).  
    - Optionally purchase up to 2 Upgrades.  
    - Actions may be done in any order.  
  - **Passing**: If you cannot or choose not to spend tokens on movement, gain 1 whistle token. You may still buy upgrades.  
- **End of Turn**:  
  - Return spent tokens to supply.  
  - Refill hand to 3 tiles from face-up display or draw pile.  
  - Replenish face-up display to 3 tiles.  
  - **Last Round Exception**: Skip hand refill.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Train Movement  
- **Coal Token**:  
  - Move one train 1 stop along the track.  
  - Must end in same column or further west (left).  
  - Cannot end on small stop occupied by opponent’s train.  
  - May pass through small stops occupied by your own trains.  
  - Must stop at Large Stops (black hexagons), which can hold multiple trains.  
- **Whistle Token**:  
  - Move 1 or 2 stops in **any direction** (east allowed).  
  - First stop is **bypassed** (no effect, may be occupied).  
  - Second stop is **activated** (resources, effects).  
  - Cannot retrace path in second move.  
  - May use whistle as coal (1 stop, west only).  

#### Playing Tiles  
- If movement leads off the board:  
  - Play a tile from hand into the empty space.  
  - Continue movement onto it.  
  - If no stop, play a second tile.  
  - If still no stop, play a third tile — **must end at a stop** by third tile.  
- Tile must be placed so track connects and continues forward (not backward-only).  

#### Activating Stops  
- **Resource Stop (small circle)**: Gain 1 resource of shown type.  
- **Coal Yard**: Gain 2 coal.  
- **Trading Post**: Make up to 2 trades:  
  - 1 common → 1 common / 1 whistle / 2 coal  
  - 1 rare → 2 common / 1 rare  
- **General Store**: Gain 1 resource of your choice.  
- **Town**:  
  - Spend shown resources → gain VPs and top share of named railroad.  
  - Fail to spend → lose VPs (no effect if score ≤ 0).  
  - Can visit multiple times.  
- **Gold Mine**: Take 1 face-down gold token (3–5 points).  
- **Stock Market**: Gain listed VP per share owned; discard 1 share.  
- **Whistle Factory**: Gain 1 whistle.  
- **Black Market**:  
  - Swap 1 stock → 1 gold, or  
  - Swap 1 gold → 1 stock (must be available on board).  
- **Scrap Yard**: Discard 1 tile from hand → gain either:  
  - All resources shown on tile, or  
  - 2 coal  
  - If discarding Special tile, must take 2 coal.  
- **End Tile**:  
  - Spend shown cost → gain VPs  
  - Fail → lose VPs  
  - Then remove train from board; place on empty resource track space; gain shown resources.  
  - “?” = choose 1 resource/token (coal, whistle, gold).  

#### Upgrades (Cogs)  
- Buy up to 2 per turn.  
- From supply: pay shown resources.  
- From player: pay resources to supply + 1 rare resource to owner.  
- Star value = VP at game end.  
- Most allow spending 1 coal for special action (counts as 1 action).  

**Upgrade List**:  
- **Coal Car**: Spend 1 coal → gain 2 coal  
- **Open Wagon**: Spend 1 coal → do 2 trades (Trading Post rules)  
- **Mine Cart**: Spend 1 coal → gain 1 gold  
- **Toll Station**: Opponents must pay you 1 resource to leave a stop where you have a train (or cannot move)  
- **Compass**: When refilling hand, look through stack and choose tile; reshuffle  
- **1st Class Cabin**: Spend 1 coal → gain 4 VP per 3 shares owned  
- **Blocking Signal**: Opponents cannot move into stops where you have a train  
- **Caboose**: Spend 1 coal → reuse current stop’s effect  
- **Safe**: Spend 1 coal → remove 1 of your shares; take 1 available share from board  
- **Warehouse**: Spend 1 coal → gain any 1 resource  
- **Extra Boiler**: Hand limit = 5; no penalty for Special tiles in hand at end  
- **New Whistle**: Spend 1 coal → gain 1 whistle  

#### Rocky Mountains Expansion (Optional)  
- **Mountain Spaces**: Can place tiles on mountain hexes by paying cost (shown on tile).  
- **Upgrades**:  
  - **Dynamite Cart**: Reduce mountain placement cost by 1 (green: 1 coal → free if 1 whistle; brown: free)  
  - **Mining Complex**: Gain 1 gold whenever placing a tile in mountains  
  - **Mountain Sheds**: If move includes mountain tile(s), gain 1 coal  
  - **Tunnel Network**: Spend 1 whistle → skip contiguous empty mountain spaces to end in or adjacent to mountains  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game Ends When**:  
- Final round completes (per turn track), **or**  
- A player removes their last train from the board (after finishing the round).  

**Final Scoring**:  
- **Majority in Each Stock Type**: 15 VP to player with most shares.  
  - Tie: player with lowest-numbered share wins.  
- **Upgrades**: Sum star values of owned upgrades.  
- **Gold Tokens**: Sum face-down values.  
- **Unused Resources**:  
  - 1 VP per common resource  
  - 3 VP per rare resource  
- **Leftover Tokens**: 1 VP per 2 coal/whistle tokens  
- **Penalty**: –10 VP per Special tile in hand  

**Winning**:  
- Highest total VP wins.  
- Tie: player with most total railroad shares wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Hand Size**: Max 10 resources. On 11th, discard one.  
- **Tile Draw**: If stack is empty, only use face-up tiles.  
- **Movement Loops**: Can loop back to same stop if track allows.  
- **Whistle Bypass**: Can skip End Tile, avoid penalty, and still place train on resource track.  
- **Upgrade Actions**: Can use multiple per turn as long as within 4 token limit.  
- **End Game Trigger**: Game ends **after** the round in which a player removes their last train.  
- **Blocking Signal**: Does not affect trains already on a stop when upgrade is bought.  
- **Toll Station**: Only applies when opponent **leaves** a shared stop.
