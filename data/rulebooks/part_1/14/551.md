## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Battle Cry is a wargame simulating Civil War-era battles using command cards to direct troop movements and combat. The objective is to capture six enemy unit flags. The game supports head-to-head play, solo play, and grand-scale multiplayer scenarios.

2. Components  
- Gameboard (standard or combined for Grand Battle Cry)  
- Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery units (each with flag and figures)  
- Generals (with flags)  
- Command Cards (e.g., Assault, Skirmish, All-Out Offensive)  
- Battle dice (6-sided, with unit symbols, flags, and crossed sabers)  
- Terrain features (woods, hills, buildings, fences, fieldworks, waterways)

3. Setup  
- Choose a scenario; set up terrain and armies accordingly.  
- Each player is dealt a number of command cards as specified by the scenario.  
- In Grand Battle Cry: two boards are joined; Commander-in-Chief receives cards and distributes to Field Generals.  
- Hexes on the boundary between center and flank are considered part of both sections.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn consists of four steps:  
1. Play a Command Card (or discard if none usable).  
2. Order and move units as allowed by the card.  
3. Battle with ordered units.  
4. Draw a new command card.

In Grand Battle Cry:  
1. Commander-in-Chief selects 1–3 cards, assigns to Field Generals (or plays special cards directly).  
2. Field Generals play cards in their flank’s sections.  
3. Field General without a card may roll a die to act on initiative.  
4. All ordered units are moved (complete all movement before battling).  
5. Battle with ordered units.  
6. Commander-in-Chief discards played cards and draws 2 new cards (max hand size enforced).

5. Core Mechanics  
Unit Types & Movement:  
- Infantry: Move 1 hex AND battle (fire or melee).  
- Cavalry: Move up to 3 hexes AND melee (or fire dismounted).  
- Artillery: Move 1 hex OR battle.  
- General: Move up to 3 hexes; may attach to a unit (sharing movement).  

Combat:  
- Range & Dice:  
  - Infantry: 4 hex range; 4 dice, -1 per clear hex to target.  
  - Artillery: 5 hex range (6 on hill); 5 dice, -1 per clear hex.  
  - Cavalry: 1 hex (adjacent); 3 dice.  
- General Bonus: Attached general adds 1 die (or 2 with rule mods) to combat.  
- Terrain Effects:  
  - Woods, buildings, waterways (no bridge): block movement/line of sight.  
  - Hill: +1 range for artillery; does not block LOS for artillery.  
  - Fieldworks: -2 dice to attackers; grants +1 morale.  
  - Buildings: -2 dice to attackers.  
  - Fences: -1 die to attackers; adjacent units gain +1 morale.  
- Line of Sight: Blocked by terrain, units, or generals unless specified (e.g., artillery on hill).  

Morale & Status:  
- Units check morale when hit by flags, attempt battle-back, or near eliminated general.  
- Roll dice equal to morale level (base 3); need at least one unit symbol or crossed sabers.  
- Morale modifiers:  
  - +1: Elite unit, adjacent to general, in landmark/fieldworks, or supported by two non-adjacent friendly units.  
  - -1: Each figure lost, each extra flag beyond first in a single roll, flank attack, or after first flag.  
- Spent units: If a "Spent" unit takes a flag, it is Routed: retreats 1 hex per flag, facing rear.  

Special Actions:  
- Battle-Back: Surviving adjacent defender may counterattack after melee if morale passed. No battle-back on flank attacks, move-battle-move, or if original attacker is defending.  
- Breakthrough Charge: If melee eliminates or forces retreat of enemy, unit may advance and melee again (+1 die). Automatic if general attached. Only once per turn.  
- Evading Melee: Cavalry or lone general may retreat 1–2 hexes before melee; only crossed sabers affect them if they do.  

Command Cards (Examples):  
- All-Out Offensive: Order all units and generals (standard); in Grand Battle Cry, Commander-in-Chief plays directly, each Field General rolls 4 dice to determine ordered units.  
- Assault: Order all units in Left, Center, or Right Flank.  
- Attack: Order 3 units in a flank.  
- Skirmish: Order 1 unit in a flank.  
- Probe: Order 2 units in a flank.  
- Coordinated Attack: Order 1 unit in each of Left, Center, Right.  
- Bombard: Order all Artillery; each may move or battle twice.  
- Leadership: Order all generals; attached units move and battle with them.  
- Call for Reinforcements: Bring in undeployed units.  
- Rally: Heal a unit; roll one die per command card held. Replace figure for each matching symbol.  
- Counter-Attack: Duplicate opponent’s last card (standard); in Grand Battle Cry, can copy section or special order.  
- Force March: Order all Infantry in one section; may move 3 hexes without battling.  
- Hit and Run: Order all Cavalry; immune to battle-back.  
- Sharp Shooter: Target one enemy general directly.  
- Short of Supplies: Target one unit (own or enemy); restricts actions.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when one player captures six enemy unit flags.  
- In Campaign Play: Pre-battle die rolls based on previous flag captures and victory count affect starting strength.  
- In Grand Battle Cry: Game ends per scenario conditions; may involve deck exhaustion and attacker/defender status.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can a unit be ordered more than once per turn? No.  
- Can a general move through a friendly unit? Yes, and may attach.  
- Can a unit attack through a friendly unit? No, unless LOS rules allow (e.g., artillery on hill).  
- What happens if a unit cannot retreat? Lose one figure per uncompleted hex.  
- Can a routed unit be ordered? Yes, but must still retreat first.  
- Can a unit in fieldworks be attacked from the rear? Yes; rear attack grants +2 dice.  
- Can a Field General play a card in either section? Yes, if it’s a section card for their flank.  
- Can a player exceed hand limit when drawing? No; must discard down.  
- Can a unit gain morale level from multiple sources? Yes; all modifiers are cumulative.
