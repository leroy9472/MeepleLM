## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Circle the Wagons: Wild West Reputation (CTWR) is a strategic card-driven expansion that enhances town-building in the base game. Players use Reputation cards to subtly reshape their towns during scoring by reinterpreting icons or territories. The objective is to optimize your town’s layout by leveraging these flexible reinterpretations to maximize scoring opportunities.

2. Components  
- 6 Reputation Cards: Charming, Prospecting, Frontier, Dry, Ranch, Hunting  
- (Note: Base game components not included in this file; assumed from context)

3. Setup  
- After setting up the base game, take the 6 Reputation Cards and shuffle them.  
- Deal 3 cards to each player.  
- Each player selects 1 card face down to keep.  
- Pass the remaining 2 cards to the opponent (in 2-player).  
- From the received 2 cards, each player picks 1 to add to their hand.  
- Discard the final unselected card(s) from the game.  
- Each player now has 2 Reputation Cards; at the end of the game, they will choose one to play.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Normal gameplay proceeds per base game rules.  
- Reputation Cards have no effect during play.  
- At the end of the game, just before final scoring:  
  - Each player reveals one of their two Reputation Cards (choice is private).  
  - Apply the chosen card’s effect.  
  - Final scoring is then calculated with modifications in place.

5. Core Mechanics  
Reputation Card Effect (choose one of two options per card):  
- A) Treat one Icon as if it were any other Icon.  
- B) Treat one Territory as if it were any other Territory.  

Each specific card enables this effect on predefined types:

| Card        | Icon Effect Applies To | Territory Effect Applies To |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Charming    | Wagon                  | Water                       |
| Prospecting | Mine                   | Mountains                   |
| Frontier    | Fort                   | Snow                        |
| Dry         | Beer                   | Desert                      |
| Ranch       | Cow                    | Plains                      |
| Hunting     | Gun                    | Forest                      |

Example: Playing *Ranch* allows you to either:
- Treat one Cow icon as any other icon (e.g., as a Beer or Mine), OR  
- Treat one Plains territory as any other territory type (e.g., as Forest or Desert).

Only one effect from one card is used per player.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After all players reveal and apply their chosen Reputation Card effect:  
  - Recalculate all scoring conditions from the base game with modified icons/territories.  
  - Players score based on updated configurations.  
- The player with the highest total score wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I use both effects on a single Reputation Card?  
  A: No. Choose only one: either the Icon or the Territory effect.  

- Q: Can I play both of my Reputation Cards?  
  A: No. You must choose one to reveal and use. Discard the other unused card.  

- Q: Can I reinterpret an icon/territory to match something that doesn’t exist in the game?  
  A: No. You must choose an existing icon or territory type present in the base game.  

- Q: When can I decide which Reputation Card to play?  
  A: You choose which card to play during end-game scoring, after all placements are complete but before scoring begins. This allows for strategic response to opponents’ layouts.
