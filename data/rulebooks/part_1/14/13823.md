## Fairy Tales — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The object of the game is to collect cards to gain the highest total points by the end of the game. Players use drafting and simultaneous card play to build a collection of 12 cards over four rounds, with card abilities affecting which cards remain face-up and contribute to scoring.

2. Components  
- A deck of cards featuring:  
  (1) Name  
  (2) Points (some marked with "*" or special symbols indicating variable scoring)  
  (3) Number (quantity of that card in the game)  
  (4) Type  
  (5) Effect or Ability (with icons indicating "Hunt", "Open", or "Close" ability types)  

3. Setup  
1) Shuffle all cards to form a single deck.  
2) Place the deck in the center of the table.  
3) Players sit around the table.  
4) Determine starting player (not specified—any method acceptable).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of four rounds. Each round follows this sequence:  
1) Drafting Phase  
2) Playing Cards Phase (three plays)  
After four rounds, proceed to scoring.

5. Core Mechanics  

Drafting:  
1) Deal five cards face down to each player.  
2) Each player looks at their cards and selects one to keep.  
3) Place the chosen card face down in front of them.  
4) Pass the remaining cards simultaneously:  
   - 1st and 3rd drafts: pass to the LEFT  
   - 2nd and 4th drafts: pass to the RIGHT  
5) Repeat steps 2–4 until all cards are selected (each player ends with five drafted cards).  

Playing Cards:  
After drafting, players play three cards:  
1) Each player selects one card from their five drafted cards and places it face down.  
2) All players reveal their cards simultaneously.  
3) Resolve abilities in this order:  
   a. Hunt  
   b. Open  
   c. Close  

Ability Resolution Order:  
- Abilities are resolved in strict order: Hunt → Open → Close, based on icons on the cards.

1) Hunt:  
- Only affects cards played in the current round (not previously played cards).  
- Cards affected by Hunt are turned face down.  
- These face-down cards contribute 0 points and have no further effects.  
- Hunt effects are resolved immediately upon reveal.

2) Open:  
- Turns face up cards of a specified type (as indicated by the icon).  
- The number of cards to open is specified on the ability.  
- Can affect cards already in play (including own previously played cards).  
- Can target the card with the Open ability itself.

3) Close:  
- Turns one card of a specified type (as indicated by the icon) face down.  
- Face-down cards score 0 points and lose all abilities.  
- Can affect the player’s own cards.  
- Can target the card with the Close ability itself.

Repeat the Playing Cards phase three times per round (each time playing one card). After three plays:  
- Three cards are now in play (some possibly face down due to abilities).  
- Two cards are set aside unused (do not count toward score or have any effect).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
After the fourth round:  
1) Set aside all face-down cards (they score 0 points and have no effects).  
2) Sum the points of all face-up cards in front of each player.  
3) Cards with variable points (marked with "*" or special symbols) are scored according to game effects and interactions.  
4) Player with the highest total wins.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can Open/Close affect cards from previous rounds?  
  A: Yes, unless restricted by the ability text. Open and Close can affect any card in play, regardless of round.  
- Q: Can a card’s ability affect itself?  
  A: Yes. Open and Close abilities can target the card they are on.  
- Q: Are Hunt effects permanent?  
  A: Yes. Cards turned face down by Hunt are out of scoring and cannot be flipped back up unless another ability allows it (e.g., Open).  
- Q: Can I look at my face-down played cards?  
  A: Yes. Players may examine their own face-down played cards at any time.  
- Q: What happens to unused cards (the two discarded after playing)?  
  A: They are set aside and have no effect on scoring or abilities.
