## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Primordial Soup*, players control tribes of primeval amoebas in an early stage of Earth's history, before higher life forms existed. The goal is to evolve your tribe by acquiring Gene cards and increasing your population, thereby advancing on the Scoring Ladder. Victory is achieved by being the first to reach the Finish Zone on the Scoring Ladder, or by being the furthest along when the game ends.

### 2. Components
- 1 Game Board (featuring the Primordial Soup, a central Compass, and a Scoring Ladder)
- 28 Amoebas (in 4 colors and shapes, 7 per player)
- 37 Biological Points (BP): 30 small (1 point), 7 large (5 points)
- 25 Damage Point (DP) beads
- 220 Foodstuff cubes (55 in each of 4 colors)
- 4 Score Markers (in 4 colors)
- 33 Gene Cards (including Advanced Genes)
- 11 Environment Cards (each showing drift direction and Ozone Layer Thickness)
- 2 Dice
- 4 Reference Booklets (detailing phases and Gene effects)

### 3. Setup
1. Place the board in the center. Each player chooses a color and takes all amoebas of that color and 4 BP.
2. Place 2 Foodstuff cubes of each color on every board space.
3. Separate Gene Cards: in a 3-player game, use only those marked with "3" in the corner; in 4-player, use all except those with a star.
4. Shuffle Environment Cards and place one face-up on the Compass.
5. Determine starting player: each rolls 2d6; highest roller places their score marker on any "1–4" space (or "1–3" for 3 players), second-highest on next available, etc.
6. Amoeba Placement:
   - In **Ascending Order** (starting with player on "1"), each places one amoeba on an empty space. In 4-player, each receives 1 DP; in 3-player, no DP.
   - Then in **Descending Order** (starting with leader), each places a second amoeba (no DP).
   - No space may contain more than one amoeba.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds through six phases in order:

#### Phase 1: Movement and Feeding (Ascending Order)
- Players act in Ascending Order (lowest on ladder first).
- For each amoeba (in numerical order 1–7):
  - **Drift**: Move 1 space in the direction shown on the Environment Card. Obstacles (board edge, Compass) block movement.
  - **Move Using Strength**: Pay 1 BP, roll 1d6:
    - 1–4: Move in compass direction (1=West, 2=North, etc.)
    - 5: Stay in place
    - 6: Choose direction
  - Movement blocked by obstacles.
- **Feeding**:
  - Amoeba must eat 3 cubes, not of its own color.
  - 4 players: 1 cube of each of the other 3 colors.
  - 3 players: 1 cube of one color, 2 of the other (player chooses).
  - If food is insufficient, amoeba **starves**: eats nothing, gains 1 DP.
- **Excretion**: If fed successfully, replace eaten cubes with 2 of own color.
- **Food Shortage**: If not enough replacement cubes, food is not replenished.

#### Phase 2: Environment and Gene Defects
- Replace the current Environment Card with a new one.
- **Gene Defects** (do not occur in Round 1):
  - Each player sums Mutation Points (MP) of their Gene Cards.
  - If total MP > Ozone Layer Thickness (on current card), player must reduce the difference:
    - Pay with BP (1 BP = 1 point)
    - Or give up Gene Cards (value = MP on card)
    - Or both
  - Any excess points lost (no refunds).
  - Discarded genes return to the pool.

#### Phase 3: New Genes (Descending Order)
- Players act in Descending Order (highest on ladder first).
- Each may buy Gene Cards using BP.
- Cannot buy duplicate genes.
- Cannot buy a basic Gene if you already have its Advanced version.
- To buy an **Advanced Gene**:
  - Must give up a specific prerequisite Gene.
  - Must have owned the prerequisite for at least one full round.
  - Pay the BP cost.
  - Advanced Genes count as two cards in scoring.
- Gene card rules override standard rules.

#### Phase 4: Cell Division (Descending Order)
- Each player receives 10 BP (3–4 players).
- Spend BP to divide amoebas: 6 BP per new amoeba.
- New amoebas:
  - Have no DP.
  - Must be placed adjacent (orthogonally) to an existing same-color amoeba.
  - Cannot occupy a space with same-color amoeba.
- Special cases:
  - Only 1 amoeba on board: 2nd may be placed anywhere (cost 6 BP).
  - No amoebas on board: place 1 amoeba anywhere for free.

#### Phase 5: Deaths
- **Natural Death**: Amoebas with 2+ DP die.
- Remove from board; replace with 2 Foodstuff cubes of each color in play.
- Dead amoebas can be reused later.

#### Phase 6: Scoring (Descending Order)
- Move score markers up the Scoring Ladder based on:
  - Number of live amoebas.
  - Number of Gene Cards.
- **Scoring Notes**:
  - Advanced Genes (e.g., AGGRESSION, ARMOR) count as 2 cards.
  - RAY PROTECTION does not count toward scoring.
  - Skip occupied spaces on the ladder (no stacking).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Mutation Points**: Gene Cards have MP values. Total MP must not exceed Ozone Layer Thickness, or Gene Defect penalty applies.
- **Gene Effects**:
  - **Defense**: Pay 1 BP to convert attack into fight (die roll).
  - **Escape**: Pay 1 BP to flee from attack.
  - **Substitution**: Flexible feeding (e.g., 3:1:0 instead of 1:1:1).
  - **Ray Protection**: Reduces MP total by 2; if discarded, counts as 4 points.
  - **Longevity**: Dies at 3+ DP instead of 2.
  - **Frugality**: Eats only 2 cubes.
  - **Struggle for Survival**: Attack another amoeba to avoid starvation.
  - **Division Rate**: Division costs 4 BP instead of 6.
- **Advanced Genes**: Require giving up a basic Gene and meeting timing restrictions. Examples:
  - **Persistence** (requires Speed): Retry failed gene actions.
  - **Movement II** (requires Movement I): Choose movement direction freely.
  - **Aggression** (requires Struggle for Survival): Kill another amoeba in Phase 5.
  - **Armor** (requires Defense or Escape): Blocks attacks in Phase 1; survives Aggression in Phase 5 with 1 DP.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End**: After Phase 6, if any score marker reaches the **Finish Zone** (final 10 spaces), the game ends.
- **Alternative End**: Game ends after the last Environment Card is drawn.
- **Winner**: The player whose marker is furthest along the Scoring Ladder wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Ties in Starting Roll**: Re-roll until order is clear.
- **No Available Food**: Amoeba starves, gains DP.
- **No Space for New Amoeba**: Cannot divide if no legal placement.
- **Gene Card Unavailability**: Must wait until returned to pool.
- **Dummy Player (for 2 players)**:
  - Use 3-player setup with dummy.
  - Movement: roll d6; 1–5 = direction from card, 6 = drift.
  - Feeding: if choice, roll d6 per color, eat color with highest roll.
  - Gene Defects: discard randomly until under Ozone limit.
  - Buys 1 random gene per turn.
  - Cell Division: roll d6 to pick parent (re-roll 8), d4 for direction.
  - Scores normally.
