# Dave's Kraftwagen – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

In *Kraftwagen*, players take on the role of car manufacturers in the early 20th century, during the rise of the automobile industry in Germany. The goal is to research, design, build, race, and sell cars to meet buyer demand, while earning points through sales, Grand Prix racing, and award achievements. The player with the most points after three game turns wins.

### 2. Components

- 1 game board  
- 4 player mats (each with 3 workshops, canteen, Grand Prix car space)  
- 41 car body tiles (values 1–7)  
- 39 engine tiles (values 1–7)  
- 8 buyer tiles (4 preferences: car body, engine, prestige, price)  
- 50 research cards (32 developments, 9 engineers, 9 instant actions)  
- 9 engineer markers  
- 56 price markers:
  - 24 colored (8 orange, 8 purple, 8 blue — 1 set per turn)
  - 32 white (for scoring)
- 10 action tiles (1–3 actions each)  
- 56 workers (14 per player, 4 colors)  
- 4 player cars (1 per player)  
- 1 marker token (black)  
- 4 start tiles  
- 10 award tiles  
- 12 V6 expansion specialty tiles (A, B, C sets of 4)

### 3. Setup

1. **Action Track (Rondel):**
   - Place 1-action tiles, then 2-action tiles, then the 3-action tile. Shuffle within categories.
   - (V6 Expansion) Shuffle A, B, and C specialty tiles into separate decks. Place top A tile in the 11th position (in front of 3-action tile).

2. **Research Cards:**
   - Shuffle deck and place face-down on board.
   - Reveal 2 face-up cards.

3. **Buyers:**
   - Sort 8 buyer tiles by preference and place face-up on board.
   - Place marker token on “S” space of buyer track.
     - (2p) Start on space 2 instead.

4. **Market:**
   - Place appropriate colored price markers on market:
     - Turn 1: Orange (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10)
     - Turn 2: Purple (2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12)
     - Turn 3: Blue (3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15)
   - Add white price markers next to buyer stacks:
     - “2” for car body
     - “1” for engine, prestige, and price
     - (Each turn, add another set even if markers remain.)

5. **Players:**
   - Each takes:
     - Player mat
     - 4 workers (place in canteen)
     - 1 car (place in pit lane)
     - 1 worker (place on 0 lap tracker)
   - Place 4 start tiles near board.

6. **Action Order:**
   - Take 1 worker per player from supply and place randomly on spaces behind last action tile.
   - Player farthest from last action tile is start player.

7. **Start Tile Selection:**
   - In reverse order (starting with player just before start player), each chooses a start tile and performs listed actions.
   - Flip tile to development side (each player gains 1 car body and 1 engine research point).
   - (2p) Randomly draw 2 start tiles; players choose one.

8. **2-Player Adjustments:**
   - Market limited to 4 cars per turn.
   - Only 3 buyers may be selected.
   - Non-player cars placed on spaces 3 and 6 of track (do not move but count in scoring).

### 4. Gameplay Flow

Each of the 3 game turns consists of:

1. **Preparation**
2. **Action Phase**
3. **Scoring Phase**

#### 4.1 Preparation
- Place correct colored price markers on market.
- Add white price markers (value 1 or 2) to buyer stacks (even if markers remain).

#### 4.2 Action Phase
- Players take turns in dynamic order: the player whose worker is last (furthest from action tiles) goes next.
- A player turn consists of:
  - **I. Take an Action Tile and Perform All Actions (if possible)**
  - **II. Optionally Move a Car to Market**

**Action Selection:**
- Player chooses any action tile in the chain.
- Move their worker to that tile’s space.
- Move the tile to the front of the chain (advances gap clockwise).
- Perform all actions on tile (if possible), in any order.

**Action Types:**
- **Hire Worker:** Take 1 worker from supply to canteen. (If no workers left, skip.)
- **Research:** Take 1 of 2 face-up research cards. Discard the other. Draw 2 new cards (reshuffle discard pile if needed).
- **Car Body:** Take a car body tile equal to your current research level. Place in empty workshop. If full, return one body/engine to supply.
- **Engine:** Take an engine tile equal to your current research level. Place in:
  - Empty workshop (return old if full), or
  - Grand Prix car (replace old engine; old goes to supply).
  - (Cannot use this engine to place car in market.)
- **Buyer:** Take 1 available buyer and place on lowest-numbered empty active buyer space (1–4). Take all price markers adjacent to that buyer.
  - If all 4 active buyers are placed, move marker token down 1 space on buyer track.
  - If token reaches 0, scoring follows this turn.
- **Grand Prix:** Advance your car on track by number of spaces equal to your GP engine value. Skip occupied spaces. Each time you cross the finish line, advance lap counter by 1.

**V6 Expansion Actions:**
- **A Tiles:**
  - Worker + take 3 engine (ignore research level)
  - GP + replace GP engine with next higher value (if Bugatti, move car immediately)
  - Car body + gain 1 point per worker in canteen
  - Engine + remove 1 car from market for 3 points (parts return to supply)
- **B Tiles:**
  - Worker + take 5 car body (ignore research level)
  - GP + sell 1 engine or body from factory for its value in points
  - Car body + replace GP engine with next higher value
  - Engine + take top card from research discard pile and perform research action
- **C Tiles:**
  - Worker + sell 1 engine or body from factory for its value in points
  - GP + take 6 engine (ignore research level)
  - Car body + gain 1 point per worker in canteen
  - Engine + remove 1 car from market for 7 points (parts return to supply)

After taking V6 tile, discard it and place next tile from current round stack (A/B/C) at front of action track. Reshuffle stack when empty.

#### 4.3 Move Car to Market (Optional)
At end of turn, player may place a car on market if they have:
- 1 car body (from workshop)
- 1 engine (from workshop)
- ≥1 worker (from canteen)
- 1 colored price marker
- (Optional) 1 engineer marker (if applicable)

Place all components together on market. Values must be visible. Car cannot be changed once placed.

**Exception:** Rudolf Diesel allows changing one category (body, engine, workers, price) by discarding a "change" marker.

If 6th car is placed (or 4th in 2p), action phase ends.

### 5. Core Mechanics

- **Dynamic Turn Order:** Determined by position on action track. After a turn, if an action tile is at the end, move it to front until a worker is last.
- **Research Activation:**
  - Development cards must be activated by placing a worker from canteen.
  - Unactivated cards do not count.
  - If a player gains a worker and has an inactive development, they must activate it immediately.
  - Start tile is automatically active.
- **Engineers:**
  - Players may use multiple engineers per turn, but only **one engineer marker per phase**:
    - Action Phase: Bugatti, Porsche, Daimler, Otto, Diesel
    - Car to Market: Horch, Maybach
    - Scoring: Opel, Benz
  - No car may have more than 1 engineer marker.
- **V6 Expansion:**
  - Specialty tiles add powerful one-time effects.
  - Only current round’s tiles are active.
  - Replace outdated V6 tiles when passed or used.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Scoring Triggers (end of action phase):
- 6th car placed on market (4th in 2p)
- Buyer track marker reaches 0

Scoring occurs in two parts:

**I. Grand Prix Scoring:**
- Rank cars by position on track:
  - 1st: 7 points
  - 2nd: 4 points
  - 3rd: 2 points
- Score for laps completed:
  - 1 lap: 1 point
  - 2 laps: 3 points
  - 3 laps: 5 points
  - 4 laps: 6 points
  - 5+ laps: 7 points +1 per additional lap
- Take white price markers from supply.
- Reset: Move all cars to pit lane, lap counters to 0.

**II. Buyer Scoring:**
- Active buyers (1–4, or 5 with Benz) each buy one car in order.
- Each buyer has a preference:
  - Car Body: highest body value
  - Engine: highest engine value
  - Prestige: most workers
  - Price: lowest price
- Tiebreaker: lowest price
- Price preference buyer: owner takes colored price marker **and** a white marker of same value.
- All other sales: owner takes only colored price marker (face down).
- After all buyers, remove all cars from market (sold or not).
  - Return bodies, engines, workers to supply.
  - Remove used engineer markers to box.
- Unused colored price markers go to white marker supply.
- Return active buyers to stacks.

#### Award Tiles (First to Achieve):
- **Grand Prix Race:** Complete 1st lap (3 pts) or 2nd lap (7 pts)
- **Buyer:** First to place 2nd buyer of any preference (3 pts) — can be triggered by Benz
- **Market:** First to place 2nd car on market (3 pts)
- **Car Body:** First to place 3 (3 pts) or 6 (7 pts) body in workshop — upgrades don’t count
- **Engine:** First to place 4 (3 pts) or 7 (7 pts) engine in workshop — upgrades don’t count
- **Worker:** First to use all 14 workers (7 pts)
- **Engineers:** First to own 3 engineers (7 pts)

#### End of Game:
- Game ends after 3rd scoring phase.
- Total points = sum of:
  - All colored and white price markers
  - All award tiles
- Highest score wins. No tiebreaker.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **More buyers than cars?** Yes. Excess buyers go unsatisfied; no sale.
- **Unlimited components?** Car bodies and engines are unlimited. Use coins if needed.
- **Engineer limits:**
  - Only one engineer marker per phase.
  - No car may have more than one engineer marker.
- **Research cards:**
  - Must take best available body/engine per research level.
  - Instant actions are resolved immediately.
  - Development cards require worker activation.
- **V6 tiles:**
  - Only one V6 tile active per round.
  - Replace previous round’s tile when passed or used.
- **Diesel ability:** Can change body, engine, workers, or price — but only once per marker.
- **Ties in buyer preference:** Buyer chooses lowest-priced car among tied options.
- **Price preference buyer:** Pays 2× price (owner takes colored + white marker of same value). Opel triples it.
