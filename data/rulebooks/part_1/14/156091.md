### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Sons of Anarchy: Men of Mayhem*, players control rival outlaw motorcycle gangs competing to become the most successful criminal enterprise. The game centers on earning the most cash through illicit activities such as trafficking contraband, exploiting locations, and engaging in violent conflicts known as Throwdowns. The ultimate goal is to survive six rounds and finish with the highest cash total.

### 2. Components
- 4 Clubhouse Cards  
- 4 Player Blinds  
- 24 Site Tiles (5 Starting Sites + 19 Random Sites)  
- 36 Anarchy Cards (including 4 Hardcore Anarchy Cards)  
- 1 Reaper Patch  
- 4 Dice  
- 20 Members (5 per color)  
- 20 Prospects (5 per color)  
- 24 Contraband Tokens  
- 24 Guns  
- 16 Heat Tokens  
- 34 Order Tokens  
- 136 Cash Bills  

### 3. Setup
1. **Play Area**: Place the five Starting Sites: Charming Police Station, St. Thomas Hospital, Emergency Room, Cut & Bag Op, and Gun Factory. Shuffle the 19 Random Sites and place 6 face down beneath the Starting Sites. Return remaining Random Sites to the box.
2. **Anarchy Deck**: Remove the red-striped Hardcore Anarchy Cards (unless playing with Hardcore rules). Shuffle the remaining Anarchy Cards and place 15 face down to form the draw pile. The rest are unused.
3. **Game Mode**: Players collectively decide whether to play **Unleaded** (all use standard Clubhouse sides) or **High Octane** (each chooses which side of their Clubhouse Card to use).
4. **Choose Gangs**: Each player rolls a die. The highest roller chooses their gang first. Play proceeds clockwise. The last player to pick receives the Reaper Patch and starts the first round.
5. **Starting Amounts**: Each player takes the number of Members, Prospects, Cash, Guns, Contraband, and Heat shown on their Clubhouse Card.
6. **Hidden Assets**: Cash, Guns, and Contraband are hidden behind player blinds. Clubhouse Cards, Heat, Dudes, and Order Tokens are public information.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the 6 game rounds proceeds in the following order:
1. **Claim Order Tokens**: Players receive Order Tokens equal to the number of Members in their gang plus Base Orders from their Clubhouse Card.
2. **Reveal New Cards**:  
   - Reveal 2 face-down Random Sites (if any remain).  
   - Reveal Anarchy Cards: 1 in Round 1, 2 in Round 2, and 3 in Rounds 3–6.  
     - **Obstacle**: Immediate effect on all players.  
     - **Hassle**: Persistent rule for the round.  
     - **Opportunity**: Temporary location usable like a Site.  
     - **Last Call**: Resolved at the end of the Black Market phase.
3. **Issue Orders**: In Patch Order (starting with Patch Holder), players spend Order Tokens to perform actions:  
   - **Ride**: Move any number of Dudes from one Location to another (not to rival Clubhouses or the ER).  
   - **Exploit**: Use a controlled Site’s ability (only if uncontested). Place an Order Token on the Site. May **Boost** for an additional Order Token.  
   - **Throw Down**: Initiate a conflict at a contested Site where you have at least one Member.  
   - **Recruit**: Add 1 Prospect to your Clubhouse (max 5).  
   - **Patch In**: Promote 1 Prospect to Member (cost: 1 Cash, 1 Gun).  
   - **Sit Tight**: Spend an Order Token to do nothing.  
   - **Club Orders**: Some High Octane Clubhouses grant unique actions.
4. **Black Market**:  
   - Each gang secretly selects up to their Heat-limited amount of Contraband to sell.  
   - All reveal simultaneously.  
   - Total Contraband sold determines price per unit (see Scoring).  
   - Each gang selling gains 1 Heat.
5. **Last Calls**: Resolve any Last Call Anarchy Cards in order.
6. **Clean Up**:  
   - Remove Order Tokens from Sites and Opportunity Cards.  
   - Return Dudes on Opportunity Cards to their Clubhouse.  
   - Discard used Anarchy Cards.  
   - Roll for injured Dudes in the Emergency Room (1–3: die and return to Recruit Pool; 4–6: survive and return to Clubhouse).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Dudes**: Members (on motorcycles) and Prospects (on foot). Only Members contribute to Order Tokens and can initiate Throwdowns.
- **Heat**: Tracks police attention. Exceeding 4 Heat forces a Member to "Take the Fall" (return to Recruit Pool, Heat reduced to 1). If no Members remain, the gang is eliminated ("Right to Remain Silent").
- **Reaper Patch**: Grants initiative (acts first each round), wins ties in Throwdowns, and breaks scoring ties. Acquired by controlling and exploiting the Charming Police Station or defeating the current Patch Holder in a Throwdown.
- **Throwdowns**: 3-step conflict resolution:  
  1. **Call for Backup**: Spend Order Tokens to bring Dudes from other Locations.  
  2. **Pull Guns**: Secretly commit Guns (max one per Dude). All Guns used are discarded. Using any Gun grants 1 Heat.  
  3. **Get Bloody**: Roll a die and add bonuses: +1 per Prospect, +2 per Member, +3 per Gun. Highest total wins. Patch Holder wins ties.  
  - **Injuries**: Each Gun used injures one rival Dude (chosen by the injured player), sent to the ER.  
  - **Pile-Up Throwdowns** (3+ gangs): All follow steps; highest roll wins. Injuries assigned in Patch Order.
- **Transactions**: Exploiting Sites may allow:  
  - **Sell**: Trade Guns/Contraband for Cash.  
  - **Spend**: Buy Guns/Contraband with Cash.  
  - **Swap**: Exchange Guns for Contraband or vice versa.  
  - **Skim**: Take items for free.  
  - **Steal**: Take items from a rival (may peek if insufficient).  
  - **Gain/Drop**: Increase or decrease Heat or other resources.  
  - **Max Limits**: Most transactions have a maximum usage per Exploit. Boosts and Skim/Gain/Drop are single-use.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- The game ends after Round 6 (when the 15th Anarchy Card is revealed).
- Players reveal hidden assets. The player with the most Cash wins.
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Reaper Patch Holder wins.  
  2. Most Guns.  
  3. Final Throwdown: All tied players roll a die and add Throwdown bonuses for all their Dudes (regardless of location). Highest total wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Tied for Most Heat on Last Call Cards**: All tied gangs are affected.  
- **No Member to Take the Fall**: Gang is eliminated.  
- **Guns at Hospital/Police Station**: Prohibited.  
- **Order Tokens**: Public unless playing "Under the Radar" variant.  
- **Exploiting a Site**: Must control it (only your Dudes present). Can Boost without using main ability (pay cost).  
- **Injuries in Throwdowns**: Applied after resolution. If winner’s Dudes are all injured, loser still retreats, leaving Site uncontrolled.
