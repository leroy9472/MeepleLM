## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Goal: Be the first to reach or surpass the king’s position on the scoring track, or have the most victory points (VP) when the action deck is exhausted. Victory is determined by VP, with ducats as a tiebreaker.

2. Components  
- Game board composed of land tiles  
- Royal City tile (placed centrally)  
- Action cards (marked A–D)  
- Chancery row (area to sell cards)  
- Player pieces: castles, knights, crest tokens  
- Ducats (currency)  
- King token  
- Scoring track  

3. Setup  
1. Assemble the board:  
   - Place the Royal City tile in the center.  
   - Shuffle the remaining land tiles and place them face-up around it in any order and orientation to complete the board.  

2. Prepare the action deck:  
   - Sort action cards by letter (A, B, C, D).  
   - Shuffle each letter group separately.  
   - Stack them in order: A on top, then B, C, D.  
   - Place the deck on its designated space; place discard pile and Chancery row nearby.  

3. Distribute player materials:  
   - Each player chooses a color and receives:  
     - 15 knights  
     - 4 castles (2 or 3 players) or 3 castles (4 players)  
     - 3 random action cards  
     - 7 ducats  
     - 1 crest token  

4. Place scoring markers:  
   - All crest tokens start at position 0 on the scoring track.  
   - Place the king token at:  
     - 30 VP (4 players)  
     - 40 VP (3 players)  
     - 50 VP (2 players)  

5. Castle and knight placement:  
   - Starting with the oldest player, proceed clockwise.  
   - On each turn, a player places:  
     - One castle on any unoccupied meadow space.  
     - One knight on an adjacent meadow or forest space (orthogonally adjacent).  
   - Castles of the same color must be at least 6 spaces apart (not diagonally).  
   - In 2-player games, each player also places all pieces for a third neutral color using the same rules.  
   - The last player to place a castle takes the first turn. Play proceeds clockwise thereafter.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, follow these steps in order:

1. **Collect Income**  
   - Receive 1 ducat for each *distinct type* of mine you control.  
     - Example: If you control at least one iron mine and one silver mine, you receive 2 ducats.  
   - **Monopoly Bonus**:  
     - When you gain your 3rd or 4th mine of the same type, immediately gain 5 VP.  
     - If you later lose control of at least 3 mines of that type (i.e. control fewer than 3), immediately lose 5 VP.  
     - This is not a recurring bonus each turn—it triggers only when crossing the threshold.

2. **Take One Main Action**  
   Choose one of the following:

   a. **Sell an Action Card to the Chancery**  
      - Reveal one card from your hand.  
      - Place it face-up in the Chancery row.  
      - Gain ducats equal to the number in brackets on the card.  

   b. **Play an Action Card**  
      - Pay the cost shown in red (not in brackets).  
      - Carry out *one* of the actions shown on the card (even if two symbols are present, choose only one).  
      - Discard the card to the discard pile after use.  

   Available actions include:  
   - **Place Borders**: Place 1, 2, or 3 border markers as shown.  
     - Cannot be placed between adjacent pieces of the same color.  
     - Cannot be placed inside an existing Domaine.  
     - If a new Domaine is formed (a castle completely surrounded), score immediately.  
     - Remove any surplus border markers not needed to define the Domaine.  
   - **Place Knights**: Place 1 or 2 knights.  
     - Must be placed on meadow or forest, orthogonally adjacent to your castle or knight (not separated by a border).  
     - Placing on a forest costs 1 ducat per knight.  
     - Cannot place on city, village, or mine.  
     - Cannot place if out of knights.  
   - **Expand Domaine**: Expand one of your Domaines by 1 or 2 spaces.  
     - First space must be adjacent to your Domaine.  
     - Second expansion can be from the first new space or another space in the same Domaine.  
     - Cannot expand into:  
       - Spaces occupied by enemy figures  
       - Another of your own Domaines  
     - Can expand into an opponent’s territory only if your Domaine has more knights than theirs.  
     - Move your scoring marker forward for each territory gained; move opponent’s marker back for each lost.  
   - **Deserter**:  
     - Choose an opponent’s knight in a Domaine adjacent to one of yours.  
     - Return it to their supply.  
     - Add one of your knights to your Domaine (pay 1 ducat if placed on forest).  
     - Cannot select a knight that would break connectivity to its castle (i.e. must remain connected via adjacent same-color pieces).  
   - **Alliance**:  
     - Choose one of your Domaines and an adjacent opponent’s Domaine.  
     - Rotate a border marker between them 90°.  
     - These two Domaines may no longer expand into each other for the rest of the game.

3. **Refill Hand**  
   - Draw cards until you have 3 in hand.  
   - Options:  
     - Draw the top card from the action deck, OR  
     - Take any face-up card from the Chancery.  
   - **Restriction**: If you sold a card to the Chancery this turn, you may not take that same card back.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Domaine Formation**: A castle is surrounded by border markers and/or board edges to form a Domaine. Once formed, it can be expanded via "Expand Domaine" action.  
- **Control of Mines**: Players gain income based on mine *types* they control (not total number).  
- **Scoring During Play**:  
  - VP gained/lost immediately upon gaining/losing monopoly (3+ mines of same type).  
  - VP adjusted immediately when a new Domaine is formed.  
- **Chancery Use**: Serves as a marketplace—players can sell cards for income or later acquire others’ discarded cards.  
- **Turn Order**: Clockwise; determined by last player placing a castle.

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends in one of two ways:

1. **Immediate Win**:  
   - A player moves their crest token to or beyond the space occupied by the king.  
   - That player wins immediately.  

2. **Deck Exhaustion**:  
   - When a player draws the last card from the action deck, continue play until all players have played or sold all cards in hand.  
   - No further cards may be drawn from deck or Chancery.  
   - After final turns, proceed to final scoring.

**Final Scoring**:  
- Award 5 VP to player(s) with the most ducats (all tied players receive 5).  
- Award 3 VP to player(s) with the second-most ducats (all tied players receive 3).  
- Total VP includes:  
  - Territory control (via scoring track)  
  - Mine monopolies (5 VP per type with 3+ mines)  
  - Ducat bonuses  

**Determine Winner**:  
- Highest VP wins.  
- Tie: player with the most ducats wins.  
- If still tied, all tied players share victory (per tie rules).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I take back the card I just sold?**  
  No. If you sold a card to the Chancery this turn, you may not take it when refilling your hand.  

- **Can I form multiple Domaines in one turn?**  
  Yes, if border placements cause multiple castles to become fully enclosed, score each immediately.  

- **Can I expand into a neutral area?**  
  Yes, as long as it’s adjacent and unoccupied.  

- **What if I can’t place a knight due to lack of spaces or knights?**  
  You simply cannot take that action.  

- **Do I get income from mines inside a Domaine that is later broken?**  
  Income is based on current control. If you lose control of a mine, you no longer receive income from it.  

- **Can I rotate a border with Alliance if no marker is present?**  
  No. You can only rotate an existing border marker 90°.  

- **Can I place borders that don’t form a Domaine?**  
  Yes. Borders can be placed strategically even if no Domaine is completed.
