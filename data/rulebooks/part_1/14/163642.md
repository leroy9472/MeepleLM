### 1. Lore & Objective
In the intergalactic commerce hub Chimera Station, players splice genetic components—brains, claws, leaves, and tentacles—onto their workers to gain advantages in resource gathering, module construction, and strategic control. The goal is to earn the most prestige points by the end of five rounds through building modules, commanding station areas, researching advancements, and leveraging unique perks.

### 2. Components
- 1 game board featuring the Command Hub, Reactor, Splicing Lab, and default modules
- 40 station module tiles
- 28 genetic components (7 each of brains, claws, leaves, tentacles)
- 24 worker pieces (6 per player, adjusted for player count)
- 4 player mats (double-sided: A for standard, B for advanced)
- 4 research markers
- 4 score markers
- 22 perk cards
- Coin and food tokens (unlimited supply)
- 2 countdown tokens (to lock Command Hub B)
- 4 round markers
- 1 start player marker
- 6 starting resource cards
- Module and perk card supplies

### 3. Setup
1. Place the board in the center. Cover Command Hub Slot B with a countdown token.
2. Place the round marker on Round 1.
3. Each player takes a player mat (recommended: A-side for new players), research marker (on Tier 1), and workers:
   - 2 players: 4 workers each
   - 3 players: 3 workers each
   - 4 players: 2 workers each
4. Set aside 2 workers per player; place the rest in the worker pool.
5. Place component supplies near the board.
6. Shuffle 40 module tiles; deal 6 face-up in the Reactor spaces.
7. Shuffle perk cards; deal 3 face-up near the board.
8. Place coin and food in general supply.
9. Randomly choose the start player and give them the start player marker.
10. Draft starting resource cards:
    - 2P: use two $2+$ cards
    - 3P: use two $2+$ and one $3+$
    - 4P: use all cards
    - Draft in reverse turn order (last player chooses first)
11. Gain resources from your card. If it shows a research symbol, advance to Tier 1 and claim the perk.
12. Keep your starting resource card for potential Reactor flush.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of four phases in order:

#### Station Progress (Start of Round 2, 3, 5)
- **Round 2**: Remove first countdown token.
- **Round 3**: 
  - Remove second countdown token (Slot B unlocked).
  - Deal 3 new perk cards (now 6 face-up).
  - All players advance 1 tier on research track (choose in turn order if multiple gain perks).
  - Module build points now double.
- **Round 5**:
  - Deal 3 new perk cards.
  - All players advance 1 tier on research track.
  - Module build points now triple.

#### Placement Phase
- In clockwise order from start player, each player places one worker from their pool until all are placed.
- Workers may be placed on:
  - An unoccupied module (board or own perk)
  - Splicing Lab (must change components)
  - Worker Lounge (gain 1 food or 1 coin)
- Must be able to fulfill the module’s effect to place there.
- **Special Action**: Once per game, discard your starting resource card to flush the Reactor (remove any modules, refill from supply). This can be done before or after placing a worker.

#### Splicing Lab Phase
- Resolve workers in Splicing Lab in order: Slot A → B → C.
- Each worker is placed on any legal space (except Splicing Lab) and activates its effect.
- If an effect grants a worker to your pool, place it before resolving the next Splicing Lab slot.

#### Feeding Phase
- Retrieve all workers to your pool.
- Pay 1 food per worker.
- For each food short:
  - Lose 1 attached component (return to supply), or
  - If no components, lose 2 points per food owed.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Genetic Components
- Max 2 components per worker (3 only with Geneticist perk).
- **Brain**: Score points equal to module value when placed.
- **Double Brain**: When commanding modules, count your own occupied modules too.
- **Claw**: Displace opponent worker with 0–1 components; displaced worker goes to Worker Lounge (owner gains food or coin).
- **Double Claw**: May displace any opponent worker.
- **Leaf**: Exempt from food cost during Feeding.
- **Double Leaf**: Also produces 2 food at start of each Feeding Phase.
- **Tentacle**: At end of turn, gain +1 food or +1 coin if you gained that resource.
- **Double Tentacle**: Also gain +1 component (same type) if you gained a component. If supply empty, score 2 points per component.

#### Building a Module
- Place worker on Constructor or build-capable module.
- Choose a face-up module from Reactor.
- Pay its coin cost.
- Gain points equal to module’s star value:
  - Rounds 1–2: ×1
  - Rounds 3–4: ×2
  - Round 5: ×3
- Place module adjacent to Command Hub or existing module.
- Slide remaining Reactor modules left; refill empty spaces.
- Gain the **build bonus** of the space where the module was placed.

#### Build Bonuses
- Coins/Food/Points: Gain shown amounts.
- Coins/Food/Points = Round Number: Gain that many.
- Component: Choose one from supply; if empty, score 2 points.
- Research: Advance 1 tier, gain reward.
- Recall: Return one placed worker to your pool.
- Reactor Reward: Gain current visible Reactor rewards.
- Activate Adjacent: Activate an adjacent module as if you placed a worker there (cannot affect the placed worker, e.g., Autosurgeon).

#### Commanding Modules
- Use Command Hub (Slot A or B) or compatible module.
- Score points equal to total value of modules occupied by **opponents’ workers**.
- With double brain worker: also count your own occupied modules.

#### Refilling the Reactor
- Done via Boiler Room or Tanning Salon.
- Gain rewards based on worker components and current Reactor drain level:
  - Drained 1: Nothing
  - Drained 2: 1 point
  - Drained 3: 1 food
  - Drained 4: 1 coin
  - Drained 5: 1 component
  - Empty: 1 research tier
- Refill empty Reactor spaces from supply.

#### Perks
- **Acquisition**: When gaining a perk, choose from face-up display. If <3 face-up, draw replacement.
- **Types**:
  - *Passive*: Ongoing ability.
  - *Module*: Private module you can activate.
- Some perks give points equal to current round when acquired.

#### Research Track (A-Side)
- Tier 1: Start
- Tier 2: Gain 1 perk
- Tier 3: Gain 1 worker
- Tier 4: Gain 1 perk
- Tier 5: Gain 1 worker
- Tier 6: Gain 1 perk
- Tier 7: Take 2 components of choice
- Tier 8: Score 8 points (repeats for further advances)

### 6. Scoring & End Game
After Round 5:
- **Resources**:
  - 1 point per 3 coins
  - 1 point per 2 food
- **Components**: 2 points each (attached or in pool)
- **Perks**: Score end-game points as printed
- **Module Bonuses**: Architect (+1 per build), Workshop (1 per module adjacent to Command Hub), etc.

**Winning**: Highest score wins. Tiebreaker:
1. Most components (attached or in pool)
2. If still tied, rule jointly.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Start Player Marker**: Can only be claimed once per round, first player to use Command Hub Slot A.
- **Command Hub B (locked)**: Counts as buildable space even when locked.
- **Vineyard Scoring**: Only modules adjacent to Command Hub count; central girder does not.
- **Double Tentacle Bonuses**: Max +1 food, +1 coin, +1 component per turn; all at end of turn.
- **Flushing Reactor**: Can be done once per game; no Reactor rewards gained.
- **Splicing Lab Phase**: Gained workers must be placed before next Splicing Lab slot resolves.
- **Worker Displacement**: Cannot displace from Splicing Lab, Worker Lounge, Dispatch Station, or modules stating "cannot be displaced."
- **Catering Service**: Cannot copy modules without point value.
- **Morale Center**: "Displacing" workers; cannot move from non-displaceable spaces.
- **Feeding**: Components lost are returned to general supply.
