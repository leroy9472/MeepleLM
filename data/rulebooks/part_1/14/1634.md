### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Combat**: Roll D6 to hit (must equal or exceed target’s Weapon Skill). Damage determined by weapon + Strength vs. target’s Toughness and armour.
- **Spellcasting**: Wizard spends Power points to cast spells; roll equal to or above Casting Number (usually 4+) to succeed.
- **Movement**: Warriors move up to their Move value; obstacles and pinning affect movement.
- **Pinning**: Warriors adjacent to Monsters cannot move away unless they break pinning (roll required).
- **Treasure**: Found after combat or in rooms; includes gold, healing items, permanent upgrades.
- **Events**:
  - *Travelling*: Random events during journey (e.g., Plague Town, Witch’s Potion, Ambush).
  - *Settlement*: Events during rest (e.g., Gambling, Duel, Investment).
- **Special Abilities**: Monsters and items have unique abilities (e.g., Fear, Regenerate, Magic Resistance).
- **Death & Healing**: Warriors at 0 Wounds are unconscious. Can be revived by healing, spells, or items. Permanent stat loss possible from certain attacks.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Gold**: Earned from treasure, combat, and events.
- **Experience**: Warriors gain Battle-levels by spending gold on training.
- **Victory**: Complete dungeon objectives (e.g., defeat boss, retrieve artifact).
- **Defeat**: All Warriors fall to 0 Wounds and cannot be revived.
- Game continues across multiple dungeons with persistent character progression.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
