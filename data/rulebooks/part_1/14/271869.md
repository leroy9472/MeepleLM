## Sushi Roll - Solo Variant - Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Sushi Roll is a dice-rolling, resource management game set in a bustling sushi restaurant. In this solo variant, you play against an AI opponent using a structured decision tree to simulate competitive gameplay. Your goal is to score more points than the AI across three rounds by collecting and strategically using sushi dice, managing tokens, and optimizing end-of-round and final scoring.

2. Components  
- Dice (in various colors: white, green, red, grey, etc.)  
- Chopsticks tokens  
- Menu tokens  
- Pudding tokens  
- Player boards  
- Conveyor belts (red and grey)  
- Dice bag  
- Scoring tokens  

3. Setup  
- Set up as if playing a 2-player game.  
- You receive:  
  - Grey conveyor belt  
  - 2 chopsticks tokens  
  - 3 menu tokens  
- AI receives:  
  - Red conveyor belt  
  - 2 chopsticks tokens  
  - 3 menu tokens  
- Place the red conveyor with the AI, grey with you.  
- Place all dice in the bag.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of 3 rounds. Each round proceeds as follows:  

1. **Draw Dice**  
   - Draw 8 dice for the AI and place them on the red conveyor.  
   - Draw 8 dice for yourself and place them on the grey conveyor.  

2. **Build AI Priority List**  
   - From the 16 total drawn dice, identify all unique colors present.  
   - Take one die of each color from the bag (not from conveyors).  
   - Shuffle these and arrange them in random order.  
   - Move the blue die to the front (optional: skip for easier game).  
   - Turn each die to its highest value. Set green die to "wasabi".  
   - Place this line of dice as the AI’s priority list.  

3. **Play Turns Until All Dice Are Chosen**  
   - The player with the red conveyor is the **active player**.  
   - Turns proceed in the following structure:  

   **A. Roll Dice**  
   - Active player rolls all their conveyor dice and places them back.  
   - Passive player (grey) does the same.  

   **B. Take Turn**  
   - Only the **active player** may act.  
   - The active player may:  
     - Use any number of **Menus** or **Chopsticks** (optional).  
     - Then **must** choose one die from their conveyor to keep (move to tray).  

   **C. Swap Conveyors**  
   - After the turn, swap conveyor belt ownership:  
     - Red goes to the player who just played; grey to the other.  
   - Repeat from A until all dice are taken from conveyors.  

4. **End of Round Scoring** (with AI special rules)  
   - **AI Nigiri Distribution**:  
     - If AI has unused wasabi and nigiri (white dice), place nigiri on wasabi (1 per wasabi).  
   - **Unused Wasabi Conversion**:  
     - Any leftover wasabi (uncovered) is converted into either a chopstick or menu token — choose the type the AI has fewer of.  
   - **Maki Scoring (Modified)**:  
     - AI scores: 3 points + 1 point for each maki it has **more than you**.  
     - If AI has 0 maki, it scores 0.  
     - You score:  
       - 0 if you have no maki  
       - 3 if you have fewer than AI  
       - 6 if you have more than AI  
   - All other scoring follows base game rules (see Core Mechanics).  

5. **Pudding Distribution**  
   - After scoring, collect pudding tokens based on pudding dice taken.  
   - Pudding tokens are kept for final scoring.  

6. **Start New Round**  
   - Return all dice to the bag.  
   - Repeat setup for next round (draw 8 each, rebuild AI priority list, etc.).  

After 3 rounds: proceed to final scoring.

5. Core Mechanics  

- **Dice Values**  
  - All dice have low, medium, high values:  
    - Non-green:  
      - Low = leftmost value on player board  
      - High = rightmost value on player board  
    - Green (wasabi/chopsticks):  
      - Low = single chopstick  
      - Medium = double chopstick or menu  
      - High = wasabi  

- **Token Use**  
  - **Menu**: Return 1 menu → reroll any number of your dice.  
  - **Chopsticks**: Return 1 chopstick → swap one die from your conveyor with one from another player’s.  

- **AI Decision Tree**  
  On its turn, AI follows this logic:  
  1. **Try to get a HIGH VALUE die**  
     a. **Hold**: If AI has a high-value die on its conveyor, take the best one (by priority list).  
     b. **Steal**: If active, has chopsticks, and you have high-value dice →  
        - Discard chopstick  
        - Take your best die (by AI priority)  
        - Return its worst die (by priority) to your conveyor  
     c. **Make**: If has menus and non-green dice on conveyor →  
        - Discard menu → reroll all its dice  
        - If high-value die appears, take best one  
        - Else, if still has tokens, discard another to reroll again  
  2. **Last Resort Rule**:  
     - If none of the above succeed, take the best die available on its conveyor (by priority).  

- **Priority vs. Value**  
  - Value beats priority:  
    - A medium-value die of low priority > high-priority low-value die.  
  - Within same value, use priority list order.  

- **Green Die Rule**  
  - If no white dice are in play (on either conveyor), move green die to **bottom** of AI priority list for the remainder of the round.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After 3 rounds, perform **Final Scoring**:  
  - **Pudding Scoring**:  
    - Most pudding tokens: +6 points  
    - Fewest pudding tokens: **No penalty in 2-player game** (i.e., you do not lose 6)  
    - Ties: all tied players receive full points (or penalty, if applicable)  
  - **Unused Tokens**:  
    - Score 1 point per set of 2 unused menu/chopstick tokens (any combination)  
  - **Total Points**:  
    - Add all round points and final bonuses  
    - Highest total wins  
    - Tiebreaker: most pudding tokens  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What if the AI has no chopsticks or menus?**  
  - It skips the steal/make steps and goes to last resort.  
- **Can the AI use multiple chopsticks/menus per turn?**  
  - No — AI uses only one per attempt, as per decision tree.  
- **When does conveyor swapping happen?**  
  - After each full turn (after die is taken), swap red/grey conveyors.  
- **What if the AI rerolls and gets no high-value die?**  
  - It may spend a second token to reroll again (if available), otherwise takes best available.  
- **Do I give my tokens to the AI when I use them?**  
  - Yes — whenever you use a menu or chopstick, give that token to the AI.  
- **Is the AI ever passive when using chopsticks?**  
  - Yes — only the active player (red conveyor) may use chopsticks.
