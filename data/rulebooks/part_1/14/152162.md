## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   - **Objective**: Be the player with the most Diamond Points at the end of the game by securing Diamond Crystals in your Vault and Showroom.  
   - **Victory Condition**: The player with the highest Diamond Point total wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most points in their Vault wins. If still tied, players share the victory.

2. **Components**  
   - 60-card deck (4 suits: Diamonds, Hearts, Spades, Clubs; each suit numbered 1–15)  
   - 110 small Diamond Crystals (1 point each)  
   - 25 large Diamond Crystals (5 points each)  
   - 6 Vaults (one per player; stores Crystals secretly)  
   - 6 Player Aid cards (illustrate Suit Actions)  

3. **Setup**  
   - Place all Diamond Crystals in the middle as the **Supply**.  
   - Each player receives:  
     a. 1 Vault  
     b. 3 small Diamond Crystals (placed in their **Showroom**, visible to all)  
     c. 1 Player Aid card  
   - Randomly select the first **Dealer**.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   - **Round Structure** (repeat for required number of rounds):  
     1. **Deal**: Dealer shuffles the full 60-card deck and deals 10 cards to each player. Unused cards are set aside unseen.  
     2. **Passing**: Dealer chooses 1, 2, or 3 cards to pass. All players simultaneously pass that number of cards to the player on their left.  
     3. **Trick Play**:  
        - First trick: Player to the left of the dealer leads.  
        - Subsequent tricks: Winner of the previous trick leads.  
        - Players must follow suit if able. If unable, they may play any card and immediately take the **Suit Action** of the suit they played.  
        - Trick winner is the player who plays the highest card of the led suit.  
        - Winner collects the trick cards face-down into their play area and takes the **Suit Action** of the led suit.  
     4. **Round End**: After all cards are played:  
        - Count cards taken in each suit.  
        - Award **End-of-Round Suit Actions** in this order:  
          i. Most Diamonds → Diamonds Suit Action  
          ii. Most Hearts → Hearts Suit Action  
          iii. Most Spades → Spades Suit Action  
          iv. Most Clubs → Clubs Suit Action  
          (Tie in any suit → no action awarded for that suit)  
        - Any player who won **no tricks** receives **two Diamonds Suit Actions**.  
     5. **Next Round**: Dealer rotates left. Reshuffle all 60 cards and repeat.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Suit Actions** (taken immediately when earned):  
     - **Diamonds**: Take 1 small Diamond Crystal from Supply → place in **Vault**.  
     - **Hearts**: Take 1 small Diamond Crystal from Supply → place in **Showroom**.  
     - **Spades**: Move 1 small Diamond Crystal from your **Showroom** → **Vault**.  
     - **Clubs**: Take 1 small Diamond Crystal from **another player’s Showroom** → place in your **Showroom**. (If target has none, nothing happens.)  
   - **When Suit Actions Are Earned**:  
     1. Cannot follow suit → take Suit Action of card played.  
     2. Win a trick → take Suit Action of the **led suit**.  
     3. End of round: Most cards in a suit → take one Suit Action (in order listed above).  
     4. End of round: Won no tricks → take two Diamonds Suit Actions.  
   - **Card Exchange**: Players may exchange five 1-point Crystals (from same location: Vault or Showroom) for one 5-point Crystal.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - **Number of Rounds**:  
     - 2 players: 4 rounds  
     - 3 players: 6 rounds  
     - 4 players: 4 rounds  
     - 5 players: 5 rounds  
     - 6 players: 6 rounds  
   - **Final Scoring**:  
     - Crystals in **Vault**: worth **2 points each** (per point value)  
     - Crystals in **Showroom**: worth **1 point each** (per point value)  
     - Example: 21 points in Vault = 42 points; 5 in Showroom = 5 points → Total: 47  
   - **Tiebreaker**: Among tied players, highest Vault points wins. If still tied, share victory.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Clubs Action – No Crystals Available?** If the player with the Thief Token (in original version) or targeted player has no Crystals in Showroom, the Clubs action does nothing.  
   - **Multiple Suit Actions in One Round?** Yes – e.g., winning tricks in multiple suits, failing to follow suit, and end-of-round bonuses can stack.  
   - **Vault Full?** No limit; store as many Crystals as earned.  
   - **Can You Move Large Crystals with Spades?** No. Only 1-point Crystals are used in Suit Actions. Large Crystals are for scoring only.
