## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Factory Manager*, players take on the role of factory owners striving to maximize profits over 5 rounds. The goal is to optimize production and storage while managing energy costs and worker allocation. The player with the most Elektro (money) at the end of the fifth round wins. In case of a tie, the player with the higher income in the final round wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player chooses a color and takes:  
     - 7 workers (4 placed in canteen, 3 available)  
     - 3 markers (Production = 2, Storage = 3, Energy = 4)  
     - 18 Elektro  
     - 1 factory board  
     - 1 set of 5 factory tiles (A, B, C, D, or E; based on back label)  
   - Place 3 storage tiles and 2 machine tiles on first 5 spaces of the factory floor.  

2. **Central Setup**:  
   - Place money, shut down markers, and seasonal workers in the center.  
   - Shuffle and randomly deal one “At Game Start” player order tile to each player.  
   - Shuffle remaining player order tiles into a draw stack.  
   - Arrange factory tiles on storage board by type and price (cheapest at bottom).  
   - For number of players: use only tiles labeled for that player count (e.g., 2–5 and 3–5 for 3 players).  
   - Shuffle 6 factory tiles with X on back; randomly remove 3, place remaining 3 face up in market area.  
   - Shuffle 8 energy price tiles, remove 3 at random, place remaining 5 face down as draw stack.  
   - Place energy price marker on space 1 (cost: 1 Elektro per unit).  

*First Game Exception*: Place a “0” energy price tile on top of the draw stack for easier start.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 5 rounds. Each round has 5 phases:

#### Phase 1: Auction New Player Order (Reverse Order)  
- Draw one new player order tile per player; place face up.  
- Player with highest current player order tile starts.  
- In clockwise order, players bid using available workers to win a new tile.  
  - Minimum bid: 0 workers  
  - Maximum bid: must leave at least 1 available worker  
  - Passing is final  
- Winner takes tile, places bid workers on it (workers are now locked).  
- Winner’s old tile is flipped face down.  
- Next auction starts with player holding next highest old tile (unless winner was starter, then second-highest starts).  
- Last player takes remaining tile for 0 bid (may voluntarily add workers).  
- After all tiles are assigned, shuffle old player order tiles back into draw stack.  
- New player order (lowest to highest) determines turn order for next phases.

#### Phase 2: Preparing the Market (Forward Order)  
- Players act in order from lowest to highest player order tile.  
- Each player selects **one factory tile per available worker** from the storage board.  
  - Must take the cheapest (lowest) available tile in any chosen column.  
  - Can select multiple tiles from same column.  
- After all players choose, **last player (highest tile)** may add extra tiles:  
  - 2 players: 0 extra  
  - 3 players: 1 extra  
  - 4 players: 2 extra  
  - 5 players: 3 extra  
  - Optional: may add fewer or none.  
- 3 X-marked tiles remain in market from start.

#### Phase 3: Factory Actions (Forward Order)  
Players take all actions in order (lowest to highest tile). Each player may:

**A. Buy & Place Factory Tile**  
- Spend 1 available worker to buy **one tile** from market.  
- Pay cost (discounts from player order tile apply; min. 0 Elektro).  
- Place tile on empty space on factory floor.  
  - First 10 spaces: free  
  - Last 2 spaces: pay 10 Elektro **only the first time** each is used  
- May place tile next to factory for later use (no worker needed when placing later).  
- Can place previously purchased tiles without using a worker.

**B. Tear Down Factory Tile**  
- Spend 1 available worker to remove a tile from factory floor.  
- Tile is removed from game after turn.  
- Space becomes available immediately.

**C. Hire Seasonal Workers**  
- After using all available workers for actions, player may hire up to 2 seasonal workers.  
- Cost: 7 Elektro each (discounts apply).  
- Seasonal workers:  
  - Equal to normal workers in function  
  - Last until end of Phase 3 next round  
  - Can be re-hired by paying again  
  - Cannot be used during the phase they are hired (only for next round)  

After all players finish:  
- Return all remaining market tiles to storage board (including X tiles).

#### Phase 4: Bureaucracy and New Energy Price  
All players act simultaneously, but resolve in player order (lowest to highest).

1. **Return Workers**:  
   - All workers (including seasonal) are returned to available pool.  
   - At least **1 worker must remain available** at end of round.

2. **Update Factory Tracks**:  
   - **Production**: Sum all dark numbers (●) on production symbols.  
   - **Storage**: Sum all dark numbers (●) on storage symbols.  
   - **Energy Consumption**:  
     - Sum white numbers (+) on energy symbols  
     - Subtract dark numbers (●)  
     - Minimum: 1 (even if calculation yields 0 or less)

3. **Place Workers in Canteen**:  
   - Sum white numbers (+) on worker symbols  
   - Subtract dark numbers (●)  
   - Place that many workers in canteen (min. 0)  
   - Remaining workers are available next round.

4. **Shut Down Equipment (if needed)**:  
   - **Machines**: Must shut down if not enough workers in canteen.  
   - **Robots**: Cannot have more active robots than active machines.  
     - Max: 1 robot per machine  
     - Extra robots must be shut down.  
   - Players may voluntarily shut down machines/robots.  
   - Place shut down marker on tile.  
   - Shut down tiles:  
     - Do not contribute to production, storage, or energy  
     - Do not consume energy  
     - Do not require workers

5. **Reveal New Energy Price**:  
   - Draw top energy price tile.  
   - Move energy price marker **that many spaces forward** (0, +1, or +2).  
   - Price starts at 1; can go higher.

#### Phase 5: Distribute Income  
All players receive income simultaneously:

- **Earnings** = lower of Production or Storage  
- **Energy Cost** = Energy Consumption × Current Energy Price  
- **Income** = Earnings – Energy Cost  
- **Round 5 Only**: Income is **doubled** (after subtracting energy cost)  
- Take Elektro from bank.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Worker Management**: Available workers drive auctions, purchases, and teardowns. Must retain at least one.  
- **Player Order Dilemma**: Bidding high gains better turn order but costs workers; lower order gives better market access but later purchase.  
- **Market Mechanism**:  
  - Players stock market with cheapest tiles first.  
  - First player buys first but has limited choice.  
  - Last player stocks best tiles but buys last.  
- **Factory Optimization**: Balance production and storage; minimize energy cost.  
- **Energy Risk**: Rising energy prices penalize inefficient factories.  
- **Discounts**: Player order tiles 4–12 grant discount per tile bought and per seasonal worker hired.  
- **Tear Down & Rebuild**: Remove inefficient tiles to make space or reduce energy.  
- **Shut Down**: Temporarily disable machines/robots to save workers or energy.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after **5 rounds**.  
- **Winner**: Player with most Elektro.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with higher income in **Round 5** (after doubling).

---

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Available Workers**: Must always have at least 1 at end of round (including Round 5).  
- **Tile Placement**: Purchased tiles can be stored beside factory; placing later requires no worker.  
- **10 Elektro Fee**: Only paid once per last two factory spaces.  
- **Robots**: Can own more than machines, but only as many can be active as there are active machines.  
- **Energy Cost**: Never below 1.  
- **Seasonal Workers**: Cannot be used in the phase they are hired. Last until end of Phase 3 next round.  
- **Discounts**: Apply per tile and per seasonal worker; do **not** apply to 10 Elektro space fee.  
- **X Tiles**: Remain in market until bought; return to storage if not purchased.  
- **Energy Price Movement**: Marker moves **number of spaces** on tile (not additive cost).  
- **Negative Income**: Allowed; player pays bank (reduces cash).
