## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Snow Tails is a fast-paced dog sled racing game set in the snowy Arctic Circle. Players control sleds pulled by huskies, racing across challenging terrain. The objective is to cross the finish line ahead of opponents while managing speed, drift, and hazards. Victory is determined by race position, with points awarded across a series of races in a season.

### 2. Components  
- 8 x Straight track tiles (double-sided, some with special features)  
- 2 x U-turns (double-sided)  
- 1 x Start tile (double-sided)  
- 1 x Finish tile (double-sided)  
- 5 x Wooden sleds  
- 4 x Corner track tiles (double-sided)  
- 5 x Centre swivels  
- 5 x Brake markers  
- 5 x Dog decks (each: 4 cards of values 1–5; total 20 canine cards per deck)  
- 20 x Dent cards  
- 5 x Sled mats  
- 20 x Wooden saplings  
- 1 x 'Big Paws' token (non-functional, thematic)  

### 3. Setup  
- Assemble a track using any combination of track tiles. The starter track “The Nutcracker” is recommended for beginners.  
- Place the Start tile at the beginning and the Finish tile at the end. Yellow flags are on the left; red flags on the right.  
- Each player selects a sled color and takes:  
  - 1 sled token  
  - 1 sled mat  
  - 1 brake marker  
  - 1 dog deck  
- Place brake marker at “3” on the sled mat. Dogs start at 3 (pre-printed).  
- Shuffle each dog deck and place it face down beside the sled mat.  
- Determine starting player (e.g., “huskiest voice”) and assign turn order.  
- Starting player chooses any free starting space on the Start tile. Others follow in order. Each space holds one sled.  
- Draw starting hand:  
  - 1st–3rd place: 5 cards  
  - 4th place: 6 cards (5 + 1 bonus)  
  - 5th place: 7 cards (5 + 2 bonus)  
- Bonus depends on starting position, not number of players.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in race order (1st, 2nd, etc.). Ties are resolved by inside position on corners or proximity to red flag on straights.

**Each turn consists of three phases:**  
1. **Play 1–3 Canine Cards**  
   - Must play at least one card.  
   - All played cards must have the same value (e.g., 4, 4-4, or 4-4-4).  
   - One card may be played to:  
     - Left dog  
     - Right dog  
     - Discard pile (to adjust brake)  
   - Cards on dogs stack (only top card counts).  
   - Playing to discard pile sets brake to that value.  
   - If no canine cards (e.g., after collision), draw dent card and canine cards up to 5, then continue turn.  

2. **Move Sled**  
   - **Speed** = (Left dog value + Right dog value) – Brake value  
   - **Drift** = Absolute difference between dog values. Drifts toward stronger dog.  
   - Must use all speed unless collision occurs.  
   - Drifts require crossing black track lines diagonally.  
   - Drifts can be distributed throughout movement, but all must be used if possible.  
   - If drift > speed, excess drift is ignored.  
   - Speed ≤ 0: sled does not move.  
   - **Balanced Sled (dogs equal):**  
     - Optional bonus movement = current race position (e.g., 3rd = +3).  
     - Bonus added to speed; taken as straight forward movement after normal move.  
     - Cannot partially take bonus.  
     - Not available on first turn (leaving start).  
     - Bonus counts toward corner speed limits.  

3. **Return Hand to 5 Cards**  
   - Draw from dog deck to reach 5 cards.  
   - If hand > 5, discard canine cards down to 5 (not played, no brake effect).  
   - Dent cards count toward hand size and cannot be discarded.  
   - If dog deck is empty, reshuffle all used canine cards (except top cards on dogs) into a new deck. Brake cards are reshuffled.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Hazards  
- **Exceeding Corner Speed Limit:**  
  - Draw 1 dent card per point over limit when crossing red line.  
  - Continue movement.  
  - Bonus movement counts toward speed.  
- **Collision with Another Sled:**  
  - Movement and turn end immediately.  
  - Sled stops before collision space.  
  - Do **not** refill hand (but discard down to 5 if over).  
- **Collision with Track Side or Obstacle:**  
  - Movement ends immediately.  
  - Draw 1 dent card.  
  - Then refill hand to 5.  
  - Obstacles: saplings, chasm columns, snowdrift walls.  
- **Hitting a Sapling:**  
  - Remove sapling.  
  - Take 1 dent card.  
  - Continue movement and turn.  
- **Chasm:**  
  - Center columns block movement (treat as track side).  
  - Free spaces allow diagonal movement.  
- **Snow Drift:**  
  - Only green-ticked spaces are passable.  
  - Diagonals allowed between free spaces.  

#### Special Movement Rules  
- **Race Order on Ties:**  
  - On corners: inside sled leads.  
  - On straights approaching corner: inside (relative to next corner) leads.  
  - On final straight: inside = red flag side.  
- **Drift Mechanics:**  
  - Only possible with unbalanced dogs.  
  - Cannot drift voluntarily with balanced dogs.  
  - Must attempt to use all drift during turn.  
- **Dent Cards:**  
  - Count toward hand size.  
  - Cannot be played or discarded.  
  - 5th dent card incapacitates sled (removed from race).  
  - Sleds that cross finish line before 5th dent still count as finished.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Race Finish:**  
  - All players who cross finish line in a round are considered finished.  
  - Winner is the sled furthest past the finish line.  
  - Tiebreaker: sled closer to red flag (chequered flag side) wins.  
  - Play continues until all players finish or are eliminated.  

- **Racing Season (Multiple Races):**  
  - Points per race:  
    - 1st: 5  
    - 2nd: 3  
    - 3rd: 2  
    - 4th: 1  
    - 5th: 0  
  - Season winner: Most points after all races.  
  - Tiebreakers:  
    1. Winner of last race  
    2. Largest whiskey collection (thematic)  

- **Starting Order for Next Race:**  
  - Reverse finishing order from previous race.  
  - Last place chooses first, then second-last, etc.  
  - Ties: resolved by random draw.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Speed Limit + Collision:**  
  - Penalty for speed limit is based on speed at red line, even if collision stops movement.  
  - Both dent cards (for speed) and no-refill (for collision) apply.  
- **Bonus Movement Timing:**  
  - Based on position at start of **turn**, not round.  
  - Can be used even if blocked by another sled (counts as “all or nothing”).  
- **Balanced Sled Bonus After Finish:**  
  - Yes, if balanced when crossing finish line, bonus may be taken (even if blocked).  
- **Hand Refill After Finish:**  
  - Do not refill hand after crossing finish line.  
- **Sleds After Finish:**  
  - Removed at end of round they finish. Do not block future rounds.  
- **First Turn Bonus:**  
  - Balanced sled bonus not available on first turn (leaving start).
