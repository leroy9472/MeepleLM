## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Cockroach Poker is a bluffing game featuring eight types of creatures no one likes: Bat, Fly, Cockroach, Toad, Rat, Scorpion, Spider, and Stink Bug. Players attempt to "pass off" cards onto others by making truthful or false claims about the hidden card’s identity. The goal is to avoid being the first player to collect four of the same creature or to run out of cards when it's your turn to play. The first player to meet either losing condition loses; all other players win.

2. Components  
- 64 cards total  
  - 8 creature types (Bat, Fly, Cockroach, Toad, Rat, Scorpion, Spider, Stink Bug)  
  - 8 cards of each creature, each in a unique color  
- Rulebook (in multiple languages)  

3. Setup  
- Shuffle all 64 cards.  
- Deal all cards face down to players.  
- It is acceptable for players to have unequal numbers of cards.  
- The player to start is chosen arbitrarily (e.g., youngest player or agreed upon).  

Special Setup for 2 Players:  
- Remove 10 cards at random from the shuffled deck before dealing (do not look at them).  
- The "pass the card" option is not available in 2-player games.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds as follows:  

1. Starting Player Offers a Card:  
   - The current starting player selects one card from their hand.  
   - They place it face down on the table and slide it to any other player of their choice.  
   - While doing so, they declare a creature type (e.g., “Cockroach”). This claim may be true or false.  

2. Recipient’s Options:  
   The receiving player may choose one of the following:  

   a. Accept the Card:  
   - Before revealing the card, the player declares “True” (believes the claim) or “False” (doubts the claim).  
   - The card is then revealed:  
     - If the player’s judgment is correct (e.g., said “True” and it was a Cockroach), the *original player* takes the card and places it face up in front of them.  
     - If the player’s judgment is incorrect, the *receiving player* takes the card and places it face up in front of them.  

   b. Pass the Card (only in 3+ players):  
   - The player may peek at the card.  
   - They must then pass it to another player who has not yet seen it.  
   - When passing, they must either:  
     - Repeat the previous claim, or  
     - Make a new claim about the creature type.  
   - The card continues to be passed from player to player, each time to someone who hasn’t seen it, until all players have had a chance.  

3. Final Player:  
   - The last player to receive the card (who hasn’t seen it) cannot pass it further and must accept it.  
   - They declare “True” or “False” regarding the most recent claim and resolve the judgment as above.  

4. End of Round:  
   - The player who ends up taking the card (and placing it face up) becomes the starting player for the next round.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Bluffing: Players use deception by making false claims about card identities.  
- Deduction: Players use logic and memory to judge whether a claim is likely true or false.  
- Passing Mechanic: In games with 3+ players, cards can be passed with updated claims, increasing bluffing complexity.  
- Turn Order: The player who receives and keeps the card starts the next round.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when one of the following occurs:  
- A player accumulates four face-up cards of the same creature (a "four-of-a-kind"). That player loses.  
- A player is required to start a round but has no cards in hand. That player loses.  

When the game ends, all other players win collectively. There is no individual winner; it is a shared victory among all non-losing players.

Special End Conditions for 2 Players:  
- A player loses if they collect five of the same creature (five-of-a-kind).  
- A player loses if they have no cards in hand when it's their turn to play.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can a player pass a card to someone who has already seen it?  
  A: No. A card may only be passed to players who have not yet seen it.  

- Q: Can a player change the claim when passing, even if the original claim was true?  
  A: Yes. Players may make any claim when passing, truthful or not.  

- Q: What happens if a player runs out of hand cards but still has face-up cards in front of them?  
  A: They can continue playing as long as they have at least one card in hand when their turn comes. If they have no hand cards when it's their turn to start a round, they lose.  

- Q: Does the starting player have to offer a card from their hand?  
  A: Yes. If they have no cards in hand, they cannot make a play and lose immediately.  

- Q: Are face-up cards ever used during play?  
  A: No. Face-up cards are only used to track losses. Only hand cards are played.  

- Q: Can a player pass the card to themselves?  
  A: No. The card must be passed to another player.
