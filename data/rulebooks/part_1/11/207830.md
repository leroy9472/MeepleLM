## 5-Minute Dungeon — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *5-Minute Dungeon*, players work together to defeat five increasingly difficult dungeons. Each dungeon is led by a boss, and your team must clear all Door Cards, Challenge Cards, and finally defeat the Boss Mat within 5 minutes. The ultimate goal is to defeat all five bosses—including The Dungeon Master—without running out of time or cards. If your party fails at any point, you restart from the first dungeon.

There are no turns—players act simultaneously, racing against the clock.

### 2. Components  
- **Hero Mats (5 double-sided)**: Each represents a unique hero with a special ability. One side per mat is used at a time.
- **Hero Decks (5 color-coded)**: Each deck corresponds to a Hero Mat and contains:
  - **Resource Cards**: Feature one or more of these symbols: Sword, Arrow, Scroll, Jump, Shield.
  - **Action Cards**: Unique per hero; have black borders and special effects.
- **Boss Mats (5)**: Represent the final challenge of each dungeon (e.g., Baby Barbarian, The Grime Reaper).
- **Door Cards**: Challenges requiring symbol matches to defeat.
- **Challenge Cards**: Include:
  - **Mini-Bosses**: Tougher than regular Door Cards; cannot be defeated by hero abilities.
  - **Events**: Immediate effects (e.g., discard cards, draw extra cards); can be canceled by the *Cancel* Action Card.
- **Timer**: Required for gameplay (physical or app-based).

### 3. Setup  

#### Choose Heroes  
- Each player selects a Hero Mat and takes the matching-colored deck.
- Place the Hero Mat in front of you.
- Shuffle your deck and place it face-down on the “Draw Pile” space.
- Draw starting hand based on player count:

| Players | Starting Hand Size |
|--------|--------------------|
| 2      | 7                  |
| 3      | 6                  |
| 4      | 5                  |
| 5      | 4                  |

> **Two-Player Rule**: Each player uses **two decks shuffled together** (i.e., each player has two Hero Mats and two decks).

#### Prepare the Dungeon  
- Place the current **Boss Mat** in the center.
- Build the dungeon stack:
  - Use **20 Door Cards** for Boss #1 (Baby Barbarian).
  - Add **2 Challenge Cards per player**.
- Shuffle all cards and place them face-down on the Boss Mat, covering the boss’s symbols.

> For subsequent dungeons, refer to the Boss Mat for required Door Card count.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Defeating Cards  
There are **three ways** to defeat most cards:

1. **Matching Symbols**  
   - Play Resource Cards showing symbols that match those on the Door Card.
   - Multiple players may contribute.
   - Used cards are **swept away** (not discarded).

2. **Using Action Cards**  
   - Specific Action Cards defeat certain card types (e.g., *Holy Hand Grenade* defeats any challenge).
   - Played cards are **swept away** after use.

3. **Using Hero Abilities**  
   - Discard **3 cards face-up** to your Discard Pile.
   - Announce and activate your hero’s ability.
   - **Cannot use ability** if fewer than 3 cards in hand.
   - Some abilities only work on specific card types (Monster, Obstacle, Person).
   - **Using an ability does not count as playing a card**, so it **does not restart the timer** if paused.

> **Refilling Hands**:  
> - Refill immediately after playing/discarding to reach starting hand size.
> - Do not refill if hand size exceeds starting number.

#### Running Out of Cards  
A player who runs out of cards in both hand and draw pile is inactive until:
- Another player uses an ability or card that lets them draw (e.g., *Divine Shield*, *Enrage*, *Animal Companion*).
- Their discard pile is returned to their deck (e.g., via *Heal*).

If **all players** run out of cards, the game is lost.

#### Challenge Cards  
- **Mini-Bosses**: Require more symbols to defeat. Cannot be beaten by hero abilities.
- **Events**: Trigger immediate effects (e.g., *Sudden Illness*: all players discard 2 cards).  
  - Can be **canceled** by playing *Cancel* before resolving the event.
  - If canceled, the card is treated as if it never appeared.

#### Boss Mats  
- After clearing all dungeon cards, reveal the Boss Mat.
- Bosses have:
  - A **number** (1 to 5).
  - Required **symbols** to defeat.
- Players may play Resource Cards matching the boss’s symbols.
- Only **Holy Hand Grenade** can defeat a Boss directly.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Winning  
You win the **entire game** by defeating all five bosses in sequence:
1. Baby Barbarian  
2. The Grime Reaper  
3. Queen of Spiders  
4. The Warlock  
5. The Dungeon Master  

After defeating a dungeon:
- Collect all cards and return decks to respective players.
- Place next Boss Mat.
- Build new dungeon per that boss’s requirements.
- Reset timer to 5 minutes.

> Between dungeons, players may:
> - Switch heroes
> - Add or remove players
> - Reconfigure decks (as long as two-player rule is followed)

#### Losing  
The party loses if **any** of the following occur:
- Timer reaches zero before defeating all cards and the boss.
- All players have no cards in hand or draw pile.
- The current card cannot be defeated (no matching symbols, no usable Action Card, no valid ability).

Upon loss, **restart from Boss #1**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I play partial matches against a boss?**  
A: Yes. You may play Resource Cards with symbols that match unfulfilled requirements. Example: If the boss needs Sword and Arrow, a Sword & Shield card can be played to fulfill the Sword.

**Q: Can Magic Bomb be used against bosses?**  
A: Yes. It provides one of each symbol. You don’t have to use all symbols.

**Q: Does using a hero ability restart the timer?**  
A: No. Only playing a card restarts the timer. Discarding or using abilities during paused time is allowed.

**Q: Can I choose which cards to recover with Health Potion or Healing Herbs?**  
A: No. Cards must be drawn from the **top** of the discard pile.

**Q: If Ambush is canceled, are the next two cards considered defeated?**  
A: No. The card is ignored entirely. Proceed to flip the next card normally.

**Q: Can Holy Hand Grenade defeat Mini-Bosses and Curses?**  
A: Yes, except for **Sheepified**, which prevents playing Action Cards (so *Holy Hand Grenade* cannot be played at all).

**Q: What happens if I trigger an ability while refilling my hand?**  
A: Abilities take precedence. Resolve the ability first, then refill your hand if needed.
