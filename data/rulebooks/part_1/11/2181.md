## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Contract Bridge – Joker Variations introduces one to four Joker cards into standard Bridge gameplay to increase unpredictability, strategic depth, and scoring dynamics. The core objective remains winning the number of tricks bid during the auction, but with added complexity from Joker powers, hidden cards, and variable scoring. Variants support 1, 2, or 4 Jokers, altering deck size, trick count, and partnership strategy.

The game is intended for players who agree in advance on Joker rules, power levels, scoring weightings, and whether Jokers are wild or fixed in suit. These variations aim to refresh traditional Bridge with surprise elements and expanded bidding considerations.

### 2. Components  
- Standard 52-card deck  
- 1, 2, or 4 Joker cards (depending on chosen variation)  
- Optional arbiter (neutral non-player for suit assignment verification)  
- Scorepad for tracking contract results, bonuses, and penalties  

Jokers may be colored (e.g., red/black) and optionally marked with suits ($\spadesuit, \heartsuit, \diamondsuit, \clubsuit$) in the 4-Joker variant.

### 3. Setup  

#### General Setup Rules:
- Choose Joker variation: x1 (53c), x2 (54c), or x4 (56c).
- Assign Joker power level **before bidding**:
  - **Major**: Jokers High in Trump and No Trump
  - **Major/Minor**: Jokers High in Trump, Low in No Trump
  - **Minor/Major**: Jokers Low in Trump, High in No Trump
  - **Minor**: Jokers Low in all contracts
- Determine if Jokers are **wildcards** (can shift suit until played) or **fixed-suit**.
- Assign suits to Jokers **before bidding**, unless using wildcard rule.

#### Sub-Variation Setups:

**x1 Joker (53 cards, 13 tricks):**  
- Deal 13 cards to each player (N, E, S, W).  
- The 53rd card is dealt face-down to one player and remains hidden until endgame.  
- This hidden card belongs to the player’s team and scores bonus/penalty points at round end.

**x2 Jokers (54 cards, 13 tricks):**  
- Deal 13 cards to each player.  
- The 53rd and 54th cards are dealt face-down to two players (one per team), remaining hidden until endgame.  
- Black Joker assigned to $\clubsuit$ or $\spadesuit$; Red Joker to $\diamondsuit$ or $\heartsuit$.  
- Arbiter verifies suit assignments if not pre-declared.

**x4 Jokers (56 cards, 14 tricks):**  
- Each Joker is permanently assigned to a suit: one per $\spadesuit, \heartsuit, \diamondsuit, \clubsuit$.  
- Marked visibly (e.g., labeled or stamped) to prevent disputes.  
- Deal 14 cards to each player.  
- Play 14 tricks instead of 13.  
- Adjust bidding baseline:
  - **Parity**: First 6 tricks are "book", so 1-suit bid = 7 tricks, up to 8-suit bid = 14 tricks.
  - **Non-Parity**: First 7 tricks are book, so 1-suit bid = 8 tricks, up to 7-suit bid = 14 tricks.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

1. **Pre-Bidding Phase**  
   - Assign Joker power type (Major, Minor, etc.).  
   - Assign suits to Jokers (unless wildcards).  
   - Declare if wildcards are allowed.  
   - In x1/x2 variants, hidden cards are dealt face-down and set aside unseen.

2. **Bidding Phase**  
   - Standard Bridge bidding applies, adjusted for 14-trick limit in x4 variant.  
   - Players may adjust high card point (HCP) valuations due to Joker inclusion:
     - **Jokers High**: Joker = 5 HCP  
     - **Jokers Low**: Joker = 1 HCP  
     - **Uncertain (e.g., Major/Minor)**: Average value = 3 HCP  
   - Partnerships must develop signaling conventions for Joker possession and suit (not specified in rules).

3. **Play Phase**  
   - Normal trick-taking rules apply.  
   - Jokers follow suit if possible; trump otherwise.  
   - **Ranking**:
     - **Jokers High (JJJ)**: Ranked above Ace in their suit  
       > JJJ – A – K – Q – J – 10 – ... – 2  
     - **Jokers Low (JJ)**: Ranked below Jack in their suit  
       > A – K – Q – J – JJ – 10 – ... – 2  
   - Trump status determines Joker rank per pre-set power rule.

4. **Wildcard Rule (Optional, for x1/x2 only)**  
   - Joker can change suit to match declared trump at end of bidding.  
     - Red Joker → $\diamondsuit$ or $\heartsuit$  
     - Black Joker → $\clubsuit$ or $\spadesuit$  
   - Cannot shift in x4 variant (fixed to suit).

5. **Endgame Scoring Phase**  
   - Reveal face-down cards (in x1/x2 variants).  
   - Score contract as normal (tricks made vs. bid).  
   - Apply bonus/penalty for hidden cards:
     - Value based on card rank and Joker power setting.
     - See tables below.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Joker Power Types & HCP Values  
| Power Type        | Trump Contract | No Trump Contract | Joker HCP (Trump) | Joker HCP (NT) | Avg. HCP |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------|
| Major             | High           | High               | 5                  | 5              | 5        |
| Major/Minor       | High           | Low                | 5                  | 1              | 3        |
| Minor/Major       | Low            | High               | 1                  | 5              | 3        |
| Minor             | Low            | Low                | 1                  | 1              | 1        |

> Note: Average HCP used when Joker's role is uncertain pre-bid.

#### Hidden Card Scoring (x1 and x2 Variants)  
At endgame, face-down cards are revealed and scored as bonus (if team made contract) or penalty (if failed).

Two suggested point systems:

**Standard Increment System**  
| Card | Points |
|------|--------|
| A    | 20     |
| K    | 18     |
| Q    | 16     |
| J    | 14     |
| 10   | 10     |
| 9–2  | Face value |

**Enhanced Increment System**  
| Card | Points |
|------|--------|
| A    | 30     |
| K    | 25     |
| Q    | 20     |
| J    | 15     |
| 10   | 10     |
| 9    | 10     |
| 8    | 10     |
| 7–2  | 5      |

> Applies regardless of Joker power. Joker power affects only in-play rank, not hidden card value.

#### Honours Bonus (Above the Line)  
If a player holds 4+, 5, or 6 honour cards (including Joker if applicable), their side earns extra points:

- 4 honours: e.g., 150 pts AtL  
- 5 honours: e.g., 175 pts AtL  
- 6 honours: 200 pts AtL  

> Example: Holding 4 Aces + Joker in No Trump → 175 pts AtL  
> Exact values are house-rule adjustable.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

1. **Contract Scoring**  
   - Standard Bridge scoring applies for tricks, vulnerability, doubles, etc.  
   - Adjusted for 14-trick maximum in x4 variant.

2. **Hidden Card Adjustment (x1/x2 only)**  
   - Team owning face-down card gains **+points** if contract succeeded.  
   - Team owning face-down card gains **–points** if contract failed.  
   - Value determined by card and agreed system (standard or enhanced).

3. **Honours Bonus**  
   - Awarded **Above the Line** after play ends.  
   - Based on highest concentration of honours in a single hand.  
   - Joker counts as honour **only if ranked high** in the contract.

4. **Draws (x4 Variant Only)**  
   - With 14 tricks, it’s possible to tie (7–7).  
   - No winner; no contract points awarded.  
   - Honours and other bonuses still apply.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can the Joker be played at any time?**  
A: No. Must follow suit if able. If void, may play Joker (as trump or discard depending on context).

**Q: How is Joker rank determined in No Trump?**  
A: Based on pre-agreed power type: High, Low, or dependent on contract.

**Q: What if teams disagree on Joker suit assignment?**  
A: Use an arbiter (neutral party) to verify before play begins.

**Q: Can the Joker be used as a wildcard in x4 variant?**  
A: No. In x4, each Joker is fixed to a suit and cannot shift.

**Q: Does the hidden card count toward hand strength during bidding?**  
A: No. It is unknown to all players and not part of any hand until endgame.

**Q: Is the Joker considered an honour for honours scoring?**  
A: Yes, if it ranks high (JJJ) in the final contract. Not counted if low (JJ).

**Q: Can both teams have hidden cards in x2 variant?**  
A: Yes. One face-down card goes to each team (e.g., N and E), increasing strategic uncertainty.
