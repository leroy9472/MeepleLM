## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Combat Commander: Pacific is a tactical-level wargame simulating combat between Japanese and Allied forces (US and Commonwealth) during the Pacific Theater of World War II. Players use Fate cards to activate units, maneuver, and engage in combat to gain Victory Points (VPs) through unit elimination, exiting units off the enemy map edge, or controlling objectives. The player with the most VPs at game end wins.

### 2. Components
- Unit counters (Japanese, US, Commonwealth)
- Fortifications (bunkers, trenches, pillboxes, mines)
- Weapons (HMGs, mortars, flamethrowers, satchel charges)
- Leaders, Heroes, Scouts, Sogecki (sniper)
- Aircraft (Dove Bomber, Fighter)
- Radios
- Objective chits (Open and Secret)
- Exit Point markers
- Sighting markers
- Smoke, Starshell, Blaze markers
- Melee, Surrender, Time, and VP markers
- Casualty Track and Time Track
- Infiltration Boxes (A, B, C)
- Fate Deck cards (Japanese and Allied)
- Order and Event cards
- Dice (white and colored)
- Track Display and Artillery Box

### 3. Setup
1. Determine Posture (Banzai, Attacker, Defender, Recon, Invader) per scenario.
2. Roll for Troop Quality (Elite/Line/Green) for US/CW.
3. Draw Objectives:
   - Player 1 (P1) draws 1 Open and 1 Secret objective.
   - Player 2 (P2) draws 1 Secret objective.
4. Simultaneously choose OB (Order of Battle) cards; adjust VP by OB Point Value.
5. Roll for Leaders (use white die only); apply modifiers.
6. Support Rolls: Player with VP marker rolls first; must purchase at least one unit. Opponent repeats if VP crosses "0".
7. Assign Posture:
   - If VP at "0": Both players → Recon.
   - If P1 has VP: P1 → Defender, P2 → Attacker.
   - If "Banzai Force": Japan → Banzai (quality = Line).
8. Map-specific adjustments:
   - River on Attacker edge → Attacker becomes Invader.
   - River on Defender/Recon/Banzai edge → rotate map 90° clockwise.
9. Defender purchases fortifications (up to available VP; no mixed FP mines).
10. Setup by Posture:
    - Defender: 8 hexes deep (wide map), 12 hexes deep (narrow map).
    - Attacker: 2 hexes deep (wide), 3 hexes deep (narrow).
    - Invader: Half or fewer units on map edge; rest on Time Track.
    - Recon: 4 hexes deep (wide), 6 hexes deep (narrow); higher Initiative sets up first.
    - Banzai: Along edge or on "1" of Time Track.
    - Fortifications: 8/12 hexes deep (same as Defender); vs. Invader: any non-water hex without enemy.
    - Infiltrators: Use Infiltrate order mechanics.
11. Decide Day/Night:
    - If Japan is Banzai/Attacker/Invader → chooses Day/Night.
    - Otherwise → Day.
12. Marker Setup:
    - Control: Defender controls all objectives initially.
    - Time: "0".
    - Surrender: Refer to OB.
    - Mines: Refer to Fortification rules.
    - Sudden Death: Jap Order + US/CW Order; modifiers: +1 (narrow map), -1 (wide map).
13. Sightings: Purchase up to 8 markers at 1 VP each; deploy within setup area.
14. Deal Cards: Higher Initiative takes Initiative card, shuffles Fate deck, draws hand.
15. Start: Banzai/Attacker/Invader goes first. If both Recon, higher Initiative starts.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Active Player Phase:**
   - Play up to OB limit of Orders (or Pass).
   - May play Actions in response to opponent.
   - Discard up to Discard Limit (US:5, CW:4, Japan:3; Night:2).
   - Draw back to hand size (based on Posture: Invader 7, Attacker 6, Recon 5, Defender 4, Banzai 3).
2. **Inactive Player Phase:**
   - Play permissible Actions (e.g., Opportunity Fire) in response.
3. **Turn End:** Switch active player.

**Die Roll Triggers:**
- Resolved before applying die roll results.
- Cannot trigger during another trigger resolution.
- On last card of Fate deck: trigger resolves after Time Marker Advance.

**Time Advance:**
- Triggered by "Time!" die roll or exhausting Fate deck.
- Reshuffle discard into draw pile.
- Triggering player makes Sudden Death roll (if Time ≥ Sudden Death threshold; roll < Time ends game).
- Defender gains 1 VP.
- Reinforcements on current Time space enter (inactive player first).

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Hand & Discard:**
- Hand size determined by Posture.
- Discard Limit: US=5, CW=4, Japan=3; Night reduces to 2.

**Initiative:**
- Initiative card cancels last die roll and forces re-roll (unlimited uses).
- Holder wins tie at game end.

**Line of Sight (LOS):**
- Obstacles block LOS at same level; create one Blind Hex behind.
- Smoke hinders LOS through, into, or out of hex.
- Blaze blocks LOS entirely.
- Intervening units do not block LOS.
- Largest hindrance applies (non-cumulative).

**Cover & Hindrances:**
- Cover reduces Fire Defense roll.
- Hindrances reduce FP or targeting roll.
- Overstacked hex (≥8 soldiers): Cover reduced by 1 per extra soldier.

**Combat:**
- **Fire Attack:**
  - Requires LOS and range to enemy not in melee.
  - Attack Total = FP + Command ± Elevation + Die Roll.
  - Defense Total = Morale + Command + Cover + Die Roll.
  - Results:
    - AT ≥ 2×DT: Eliminate.
    - AT > DT: Break.
    - AT = DT: Suppress (Break if moving).
    - AT < DT: No effect.
- **Fire Groups:**
  - Adjacent chain of units; FP = FP of one unit + 1 per additional unit.
  - Ordnance cannot participate.
- **Ordnance (mortars, aircraft, radios):**
  - Targeting roll: multiply dice; must exceed range + hindrance.
  - If hit, Fire Attack roll: FP + Die Roll (no Command or Hindrance).
- **Melee:**
  - Triggered at start of Allied player’s turn in hexes with both sides.
  - Allied player chooses resolution order.
  - Melee FP = sum of unit FP +1 per boxed FP.
  - Japanese rolls first; lower total loses all units. Tie → both eliminated (unless bunker/pillbox: defender wins).
- **Opportunity Fire (Op Fire):**
  - During enemy Move, after MP expenditure.
  - One Fire Attack per MP spent.
  - Ordnance cannot Op Fire.
  - Attacking unit must be activated for Op Fire.

**Posture Effects:**
- Banzai: Hand size 3; Charge order usable; eliminated units go to Time Track.
- Defender: Hand size 4; gains 1 VP per Time Advance.
- Invader: Hand size 7; half forces start on Time Track.

**Night Rules:**
- Discard Limit = 2.
- Terrain costs +1 MP.
- Night Hindrance = range to target (negated by starshell).
- No Communication Established or Air Support.

**Special Units:**
- **Leader:** Activates units in Command Radius; adds Command to FP, Morale, Range, Movement.
- **Hero:** Can be activated multiple times; no elimination/exit VPs; returns to countermix when lost.
- **Scout:** Spots for mortars anywhere; no Command bonus.
- **Sogecki:** Ordnance; multiplies dice on Fire Attack; affects one unit.

**Orders:**
- **Advance:** Move 1 hex ignoring terrain; no Op Fire; may enter enemy hex (triggers melee).
- **Asset Denied:** Jam enemy weapon, disrupt radio, or abort aircraft.
- **Asset Request:** Establish/Restore radio, Fire for Effect, Bombing/Strafing Run, Repair weapon, Illumination.
- **Charge (Japan only):** Rally and activate all unactivated Japanese units for Move; Allied Op Fire before movement.
- **Fire:** Standard fire attack; may form Fire Group.
- **Infiltrate:** Hide (roll reinforcement into Infiltration Box) or Reveal (place unit from Box to Sighting marker hex).
- **Move:** Spend MPs; Op Fire possible.
- **Reconnoiter:** Look at top Fate card; choose to keep, discard, or return.
- **Revive:** Spend points (1–5) to suppress or rally units.
- **Pass:** Discard up to limit; draw to hand size.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Victory Points (VP):**
- **Elimination:**
  - Squad: 2 VP
  - Team: 1 VP
  - Leader: 1 VP + 1 VP per Command point
  - Hero: 0 VP
- **Exit:** Off enemy edge via Exit Point; costs 1 MP; earns 0–3 VP based on Exit Point.
- **Objectives:**
  - Open: Awarded immediately on control change.
  - Secret: Awarded at end of game.
  - Building: Entire building must be enemy-free.
  - Control: Last sole occupant gains control.

**Game End Conditions:**
- Allied player places unit on Surrender marker → automatic loss.
- Player’s last unit eliminated and no units in Infiltration Box → loss.
- Player’s last unit removed (non-elimination) and no Infiltration Box units → loss.
- Sudden Death roll succeeds (roll < Time when Time ≥ Sudden Death threshold).
- Time Advance triggers Sudden Death check.

**Final Scoring:**
- If no automatic loss, compare VP totals.
- VP = 0 or tie → Initiative card holder wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Initiative Use:** Can be passed unlimited times; cancels die roll and trigger.
- **Die Triggers:** Cannot chain during trigger resolution.
- **Melee Timing:** Only Allied player triggers melee at start of turn.
- **Overstacking:** Only penalized during gameplay, not setup.
- **Sighting Markers:** Moved to any hex generated by random trigger.
- **Starshells:** Disperse on Disperse trigger; illuminate 3-hex radius.
- **Caves:** Japanese units can Advance between caves; immune to fire from upslope.
- **Errata:**
  - Cards A-3, C-31, C-32: Event is "Stealth", not "Low Crawl".
  - Scenario D: Draw six random hexes (not nine).
