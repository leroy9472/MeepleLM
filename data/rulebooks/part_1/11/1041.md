### 1. Lore & Objective  
San Marco is a strategic board game set in Renaissance Venice, where players compete as aristocratic families vying for influence across the city's districts. The objective is to score the most prestige points by strategically placing aristocrats, building bridges, and controlling key districts over three passages (phases) of play. Victory is determined by final scoring after the third passage.

### 2. Components  
- Aristocrats (cubes) – 25 per player in each player color  
- Prestige stones (circles) – 1 per player in each color  
- Bridges – 1 per player (2 per player in a 3-player game)  
- Game board featuring 6 numbered districts and a scoring track  
- Stone tablet area with two columns (I and II) for turn order  
- Sundial marker (orange circle)  
- Two card decks:  
  - Action cards (dark back)  
  - Limit cards (light back)  
- One six-sided die  

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player takes 25 aristocrats, 1 prestige stone, and 1 bridge (2 if playing with 3 players).  
2. Place each player’s prestige stone on space "0" of the scoring track. Place the orange sundial marker on space "1".  
3. Shuffle the Action and Limit card decks separately and place them face down.  
4. Each player rolls the die 4 times, placing 2 of their aristocrats into the district shown on each roll.  
   - If a player rolls the same number all 4 times, they may re-roll until at least one different number appears.  
5. Starting with the start player, each player places one of their bridges between two districts and places 1 of their aristocrats on it to claim ownership.  
   - No more than 3 bridges may connect any pair of districts.  
   - In a 3-player game, each player places both of their bridges during this step.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of 3 passages. Each passage contains multiple turns until the passage ends.

**Turn Order:**  
- The start player rotates left at the beginning of each turn.

**Each Turn Proceeds in 4 Steps:**  
1. **Assign Roles on Stone Tablet**  
   - The start player places their prestige stone in the top-left box (Column I, top row).  
   - Other players’ stones are drawn randomly:  
     - 3 players: Both remaining stones go under the start player’s in Column I (3 total, stacked).  
     - 4 players: First drawn stone goes under start player in Column I; second and third go in Column II (top and bottom).  
   - Top row = Distributors; bottom row(s) = Decision-Makers.

2. **Distributors Draw and Deal Hands**  
   - Each Distributor draws:  
     - 3 players: 6 Action and 4 Limit cards  
     - 4 players: 5 Action and 3 Limit cards  
   - They divide these into hands equal to the number of stones in their column:  
     - 3 players: 3 hands (1 for each player)  
     - 4 players: 2 hands per column (each Distributor makes 2 hands)  
   - Each hand must contain at least 1 card.

3. **Players Choose and Play Hands**  
   - Players choose hands in this order:  
     - 3 players: Decision-Maker I-1 → Decision-Maker I-2 → Distributor  
     - 4 players: Decision-Maker I → Distributor I → Decision-Maker II → Distributor II  
   - Decision-Makers can only choose from the two hands created by the Distributor above them.  
   - To play a hand:  
     - Resolve all Action cards in any order.  
     - Place all Limit cards face up in front of the player.

4. **Check Passage End Condition**  
   - After all hands are played, check how many players have fewer than 10 total Limit card points:  
     - If 2 or 3 players have <10: continue with another turn.  
     - If only 1 or 0 players have <10: the passage ends.  
   - In a 2-player game during final round: only 1 Distributor and 1 Decision-Maker.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Effects  
- **District Card**:  
  - Play 1 aristocrat into the matching numbered district.  
  - Then, optionally move that aristocrat across one of your bridges to an adjacent district.

- **Bridge Card**:  
  - Place a new bridge from the supply between two districts.  
  - If no bridges remain in supply, take control of another player’s bridge (remove their cube).  
  - You may then relocate that bridge to any valid connection.  
  - Maximum of 3 bridges (from different players) allowed between any two districts.

- **Transfer Card**:  
  - Replace 1 opponent’s aristocrat in any district with one of your own.

- **Banishment Card**:  
  - Name a district and roll the die. Remove that many aristocrats from the district (including your own if needed).  
  - All removed cubes return to their owners’ supplies.

- **Doge Card**:  
  - First use: Place the Doge in a district to score it immediately.  
  - Subsequent uses: Move the Doge to a new district to score it.  
  - Movement rules:  
    - Cross an opponent’s bridge by paying them 1 prestige point (can go negative).  
    - Cross a canal (no bridge) at a cost of 2 prestige points.  
  - Only the player holding the Doge may score districts.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Scoring a District  
- When a district is scored (by Doge placement or endgame):  
  - The player with the most aristocrats scores the higher value shown on the district.  
  - The player with the second-most scores the lower value.  
  - Tie for first: both score the lower value.  
  - Tie for second: tied players score nothing.

#### End of a Passage  
- All players with fewer than 10 Limit points receive bonus points:  
  - Bonus = (Highest Limit total in passage) – (Player’s Limit total)  
- If only one player has the fewest Limit points (regardless of being below 10), they perform an extra Banishment (as if playing the card).  
- Advance the sundial marker by 1.  
- Start player rotates left.

#### Final Scoring (End of Game)  
- The game ends after the third passage.  
- All six districts are scored, regardless of Doge position.  
- Total all scored points.  
- The player with the highest score wins.  
- Tiebreaker: compare number of aristocrats in the San Marco district (District 1). Most wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I pay prestige to cross my own bridge?**  
  No. You only pay when crossing an opponent’s bridge.

- **Can I use a Bridge card to move a bridge I just took over?**  
  Yes. Taking over a bridge (via Bridge card) allows you to immediately relocate it.

- **Can I play a Banishment and remove only opponents’ pieces?**  
  Only if the required number can be met without your own. If not, you must remove your own aristocrats too.

- **Can I score a district multiple times?**  
  Yes, if the Doge is moved there again after another district was scored.

- **What happens when the card decks run out?**  
  Decks are reshuffled when exhausted (implied by standard card game mechanics; not explicitly stated but assumed).

- **Can I have negative prestige points?**  
  Yes, especially when paying to cross bridges or canals using the Doge.
