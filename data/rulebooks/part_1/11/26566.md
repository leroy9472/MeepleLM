## Homesteaders — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Players are settlers in the Old West developing land into towns and cities over 10 rounds. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by building structures, managing resources, and contributing to railroad development. The city will be named after the player with the highest score.

2. **Components**  
- Auction board with three auction spaces (Auction 1, 2, and 3)  
- Auction tiles (Settlement, Town, City), sorted by stage and round  
- Building tiles: Residential, Industrial, Commercial, Special (categorized by stage: Settlement, Town, City)  
- Player screens, bid markers, worker tokens, rail line tokens  
- Resources: Wood, Food, Steel, Gold, Livestock, Copper  
- Trade chits, Debt chits, Silver coins, VP chips  
- Railroad Development Track (shared progress track)  
- Homesteader start tiles (one per player)  
- (5-player variant only): Double Auction marker, extra Homesteader tile, player screen, black cubes)

3. **Setup**  
- Each player receives:  
  - 1 worker  
  - $6 (silver)  
  - 1 Homesteader start tile (player color)  
  - 1 player screen  
  - 2 player markers (one for bidding, one for Railroad Development Track)  
- Public: workers, rail lines, buildings  
- Hidden: resources, money, trade chits, debt, VP  
- Auction 1: Place round-specific tiles face-up in order; players may view entire pile  
- Auction 2: Shuffle tiles in order—4 Settlement (top), 4 Town, 2 City (bottom)—and place face-down; reveal top tile each round  
- Auction 3: Same as Auction 2; used only in 4-player games  
- Building Supply:  
  - Rounds 1–4: Settlement and Settlement/Town buildings available  
  - Round 5: Remove unbuilt Settlement-only buildings; add Town buildings  
  - Round 9: Remove unbuilt Town-only buildings; add City buildings  
- 2-player game: Only one copy of each building except Farm, Market, Foundry (two copies each)  
- Randomly choose starting player

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Each of the 10 rounds consists of three phases:

**A) Setup Phase**  
- Retrieve bid markers from previous round  
- Reveal top tile of each face-down auction pile (Auction 2 and 3)  
- Discard old auction tiles  
- In Round 5 and Round 9: Remove expired-stage buildings not yet built

**B) Income Phase**  
- Allocate workers to worker slots on buildings  
- Collect income:  
  - Automatic income from buildings  
  - Worker income (if workers assigned)  
  - $1 per rail line owned  
- All income is collected behind player screen  
- Pay $1 per worker (active or idle) to the bank  
  - Payment may come from cash, gold (no change), marketplace, or debt

**C) Auction Phase**  
- Bidding order: Starting player, then clockwise  
- Players may:  
  - Bid on any auction space (minimum $3, maximum $21)  
  - Pass (exit auction for the round)  
- Bidding rules:  
  - Must outbid current highest bid by at least $1  
  - May bid more than available cash (take debt)  
  - Once passed, player is out for the round  
- After passing or being outbid:  
  - Advance personal marker on Railroad Development Track  
  - Choose one bonus from any space reached or passed  
- Neutral bid token (2-player only):  
  - Starts at $5 on any auction  
  - Increases by $1 if both players win an auction; max $9  
  - Decreases by $1 when a player passes; minimum $3  
  - Start player places neutral bid before first bid

**Building Phase**  
- After all bids resolved:  
  - Winner of Auction 1 builds first, becomes next start player  
  - Then winners of Auction 2, then Auction 3 (if applicable)  
- To build:  
  - Pay auction bid (via cash, gold, marketplace, or debt)  
  - Pay building cost in resources (may use marketplace)  
  - Receive building bonus (once only, after construction)  
- Auction tiles not won are discarded  
- Some auction tiles grant immediate benefits (workers, railroad advancement) instead of building actions

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Worker Allocation**: Workers assigned to buildings to generate income or activate abilities  
- **Resource Management**: Buy/sell resources via marketplace at any time  
- **Marketplace Actions (available anytime)**:  
  - Recruit worker: 1 trade chit + 1 food  
  - Buy resource: Pay listed price  
  - Sell resource: Gain 1 VP per sale  
- **Debt**:  
  - Take $2 per debt chit (at any time)  
  - Repay at any time for $5 per chit  
- **Gold**: Worth $5; no change given when used  
- **Railroad Development Track**:  
  - Triggered by: passing in auction, winning auction with "advance" bonus, or building a "track-advance" building  
  - When advancing: move marker and claim one bonus from any space reached or passed  
  - If already at end: still choose any bonus without moving  
- **Building Rules**:  
  - Cannot build duplicate named buildings  
  - Must match building type to auction won (e.g., Settlement auction → Settlement building)  
  - Bonuses (e.g., VP, resources) taken only once after construction

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- After Round 10, conduct one final Income phase  
- Then, players may use Marketplace freely (sell resources, recruit workers, repay debt)  
- Final scoring:  
  - VP chips  
  - Building base VP values  
  - Building bonus VP (end-game bonuses)  
  - 2 VP each for: Gold, Livestock, Copper  
  - Wood, Food, Steel: no VP  
  - Debt penalty:  
    - 1st unpaid debt: -1 VP  
    - 2nd: -2 VP  
    - 3rd: -3 VP, etc.  
    - Total penalty = sum of penalties (e.g., 3 debts = -6 VP)  
- Highest total VP wins  
- Tiebreaker: Most silver (money)

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **May I use the marketplace during the auction phase?**  
  Yes. Marketplace may be used at any time, including during income or auction phases.  
- **Can I pay worker wages with gold?**  
  Yes, but $5 gold piece used as payment gives no change.  
- **What if I can’t pay my workers?**  
  You must pay $1 per worker. If short, take debt or use marketplace.  
- **Can I win an auction and choose not to build?**  
  No. Winning an auction requires immediate building (if building-type tile) or taking benefit (if non-building tile).  
- **Can I sell resources for VP more than once?**  
  Yes. Each sale gives 1 VP, regardless of resource or frequency.  
- **What happens if I advance on Railroad Track past multiple bonuses?**  
  You may choose any one bonus from any space reached or passed.  
- **Can I take debt during final scoring?**  
  No. Final scoring allows only marketplace use and debt repayment, not new debt.  
- **5-player variant: The Double Auction**  
  - After Income phase, starting player selects one auction bay as "Double Auction" and places marker  
  - In that bay, top two bidders both win  
  - Both pay, build, and gain all benefits (including track advancement, bonuses)  
  - Highest bidder builds first and becomes start player (if Auction 1)  
  - Bidding rule: must outbid all others; cannot bid into second place directly  
  - Third place or lower = outbid
