## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   Each player is a zookeeper building a zoo to attract visitors. The goal is to score the most points by strategically collecting animals, filling enclosures, and managing resources. The player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most coins wins. If still tied, the game ends in a tie.

2. **Components**  
   - 5 Zoo boards (each with enclosures of varying sizes)  
   - 5 Expansion boards (face-down initially)  
   - 112 Square Tiles:  
     - 88 Animal tiles (11 each of 8 types; each type has 2 fertile males and 2 fertile females)  
     - 12 Vending Stall tiles (3 each of 4 types)  
     - 12 Coin tiles  
   - 16 Round Offspring tiles (2 per animal type)  
   - 5 Delivery Trucks (3-space capacity)  
   - 30 Wooden Coins  
   - 1 Red Wooden Disk (marks end-game stack)  

3. **Setup**  
   - **Player Count Adjustments**:  
     - 2 players: Remove 3 animal types (and their offspring)  
     - 3 players: Remove 2 animal types  
     - 4 players: Remove 1 animal type  
     - 5 players: Use all animal types  
   - Each player receives:  
     - 1 Zoo board  
     - 1 Expansion board (placed face-down)  
     - 2 Coins  
   - Shuffle all square tiles face-down into multiple stacks.  
   - Set aside a stack of 15 tiles and place the red wooden disk on top.  
   - Place the remaining tiles in stacks on the table.  
   - Place the round offspring tiles in a supply bank.  
   - Place a number of delivery trucks equal to the number of players in the center.  
   - Choose a starting player; play proceeds clockwise.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   The game consists of multiple rounds. On a player's turn, they choose one of the following actions:  
   a. **Add a Tile**: Draw and reveal the top tile from any stack (except the end-game stack until others are exhausted), and place it on an empty space of any unclaimed delivery truck.  
   b. **Take a Delivery Truck**: Choose a truck with at least one tile, take it and all its tiles, then pass for the rest of the round.  
   c. **Perform a Money Action**: Spend coins to perform one of several actions (see below).  

   A round ends when all players have taken a delivery truck. Return empty trucks to the center. The next round begins with the player who took the last truck.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Tile Placement (after taking a truck)**:  
     - **Animals**: Place in an empty enclosure space or in the barn. Each enclosure may hold only one animal type. The same animal type may be in multiple enclosures. If no legal enclosure space exists, the animal must go to the barn.  
     - **Vending Stalls**: Place on an empty stall space or in the barn. If no stall spaces are available, it must go to the barn.  
     - **Coin Tiles**: Add to your coin supply; interchangeable with wooden coins.  
     - **The Barn**: May hold any number and type of tiles (animals, stalls). A tile may be placed in the barn even if a legal enclosure space exists.  
   - **Offspring**:  
     - Each animal type has 2 fertile males and 2 fertile females.  
     - When a male and female of the same type are in the same enclosure, they immediately produce one offspring.  
     - Place the offspring tile in the enclosure if space allows; otherwise, place in the barn.  
     - Each fertile animal can produce offspring only once.  
     - Offspring are treated as regular animals.  
     - Offspring are not produced in barns or on trucks.  
   - **Money Actions (costs paid to the bank unless otherwise noted)**:  
     - **Move (1 coin)**:  
       - Move 1 animal tile from barn to an empty enclosure space.  
       - Move 1 vending stall tile to any empty stall space or to the barn.  
     - **Exchange (1 coin)**:  
       - Swap all tiles of one animal type in one location (enclosure or barn) with all tiles of another animal type in a different location.  
       - Must involve exactly two non-empty locations.  
       - The destination must have enough space.  
       - Vending stalls may not be exchanged.  
     - **Purchase (2 coins)**:  
       - Buy any animal or vending stall tile from another player's barn.  
       - Pay 1 coin to the owner, 1 coin to the bank.  
       - The seller cannot refuse.  
     - **Discard (2 coins)**:  
       - Remove any tile from your own barn from the game.  
       - Both coins go to the bank.  
     - **Expand Zoo (3 coins)**:  
       - Turn your expansion board face-up, gaining 1 new enclosure and 1 stall space.  
   - **Enclosure Bonus**:  
     - When a player places a tile on the last empty space of an enclosure, they receive bonus coins equal to the number shown on the enclosure.  
     - No bonus if the bank is out of coins.  
     - No bonus if the enclosure is filled as a result of an Exchange action (including via offspring from such an exchange).

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - **End Game Trigger**: When a player draws the first tile from the stack covered by the red wooden disk, finish the current round. Then proceed to scoring.  
   - **Scoring**:  
     - **Enclosures**:  
       - **Filled (no empty spaces)**: Score the larger number shown (e.g., 8/5 → 8).  
       - **One empty space**: Score the smaller number shown (e.g., 8/5 → 5).  
       - **Two or more empty spaces**: Score +1 per animal tile **only if** at least one vending stall is present in the associated stall spaces.  
     - **Vending Stalls**:  
       - +2 points for each **type** of vending stall placed on stall spaces.  
       - -2 points for each **type** of vending stall in the barn.  
     - **Barn Penalties**:  
       - -2 points for each **type** of animal in the barn.  
   - **Final Scoring**: Total all positive and negative points.  
   - **Winning**: Highest score wins. Tiebreaker: most coins. If still tied, the game is a tie.
