## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Roll Through the Ages: The Bronze Age is a dice-rolling civilization-building game where players develop their societies through technological advances, monument construction, and city expansion. The objective is to score the most points by acquiring developments, completing monuments, building cities, and avoiding disasters.

### 2. Components  
- 4 Pegboards  
- 24 Pegs (6 per player: food + 5 goods)  
- 7 Dice  
- 1 Score Sheet Pad  
- Pencil (not included)

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player receives:  
   - 1 pegboard  
   - 6 pegs (1 food, 5 goods: Wood, Stone, Pottery, Cloth, Spearheads)  
   - 1 score sheet  
   - 1 pencil  
2. Set pegs:  
   - Food peg at '3'  
   - All goods pegs at '0' (far left)  
3. Determine starting player:  
   - They draw a star on their score sheet  
   - Receive 3 dice to begin  
4. Adjust for player count:  
   - 2 players: Cross out Temple and Great Pyramid on all score sheets  
   - 3 players: Cross out Hanging Gardens on all score sheets  
   - 4 players: All monuments available  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each player takes a turn in clockwise order. A full turn consists of 5 steps:

#### 1. Roll Dice and Collect Goods and Food  
- Roll 1 die per city (start with 3 cities = 3 dice)  
- You may roll up to 3 times:  
  a. First roll: Set aside any dice showing "Skull & 2 Goods"  
  b. Re-roll remaining dice; set aside any new skulls  
  c. Optional third roll: Re-roll non-skull dice  
  d. After third roll, keep all results  
- Dice faces:  
  - 3 Food  
  - 2 Food or 2 Workers (choose one)  
  - 1 Good  
  - 2 Goods and 1 Skull  
  - 3 Workers  
  - 7 Coins  

**Collect Goods:**  
- Count total goods (including from skull sides)  
- Add one good at a time starting from Wood → Stone → Pottery → Cloth → Spearheads  
- When reaching top, loop back to Wood  
- If a row is full, still count the good but do not advance peg  
- Each position right of '0' counts as 1 good  

**Collect Food:**  
- Move food peg right for each food symbol  
- Max 15 food  
- Excess beyond capacity is lost  

#### 2. Feed Cities and Resolve Disasters  
**Feed Cities:**  
- Spend 1 food per city (1 per die rolled)  
- For each unfed city, check 1 disaster box  

**Resolve Disasters (if >1 skull rolled):**  
- **Drought (2 skulls):** Check 2 disaster boxes unless you have Irrigation  
- **Pestilence (3 skulls):** Each opponent checks 3 disaster boxes unless they have Medicine  
- **Evil Invasion (4 skulls):** Check 4 disaster boxes unless you have Great Wall  
- **Revolt (5+ skulls):** Lose all goods unless you have Religion (if all players have Religion, opponents lose all goods)  

*Note: Pestilence affects opponents only; others affect self unless prevented.*

#### 3. Build Cities and Monuments  
- For each Worker symbol rolled, check off 1 box in a City or Monument  
- **City:** When all boxes filled, circle the die icon. Gain +1 die in future turns (max 7 dice)  
- **Monument:** When all boxes filled:  
  - First player to complete circles the **left (higher)** point value  
  - Other players cross out the left number and may later circle the **right (lower)** value  
  - Uncompleted monuments score nothing  

*LATE Variant: Ships – Pay 1 Wood + 1 Cloth to buy a ship (requires Shipping development)*

#### 4. Buy One Development  
- May buy **exactly one** development per turn  
- Pay using:  
  - Coins rolled × 7 (or ×12 with Coinage)  
  - Goods: Spend entire type of good at its current track value (no change given)  
- Developments can only be bought once per player  
- Circle points and check box when purchased  

| Development | Cost | Points | Effect |
|------------|------|--------|--------|
| Leadership | 10 | 2 | Reroll 1 die after final roll |
| Irrigation | 10 | 2 | Drought has no effect |
| Agriculture | 15 | 3 | +1 food per food die |
| Quarrying | 15 | 3 | +1 stone when collecting stone |
| Medicine | 15 | 3 | Pestilence has no effect |
| Coinage | 20 | 4 | Coins worth 12 instead of 7 |
| Caravans | 20 | 4 | No need to discard goods over 6 |
| Religion | 20 | 6 | Revolt causes opponents to lose goods |
| Granaries | 30 | 6 | Sell food for 4 coins each |
| Masonry | 30 | 6 | +1 worker per worker die |
| Engineering | 40 | 6 | Convert 3 workers to 1 stone |
| Architecture | 50 | 8 | +1 point per completed monument |
| Empire | 60 | 8 | +1 point per city |

#### 5. Discard Goods in Excess of 6  
- Total goods = number of peg positions right of '0'  
- Reduce to ≤6 goods by moving pegs left  
- Exception: Caravans development negates this step  

Pass dice to next player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Pegboard Progression:** Goods are collected in fixed order: Wood → Stone → Pottery → Cloth → Spearheads (looping)  
- **Scoring Triggers:** Game ends when any player buys 5th development OR all monuments are completed by any player  
- **Player Order:** Final turn goes to player immediately right of start player (star-marked)  
- **Trading (Variant):** Active player may trade goods/food with others (no inter-player trades); with ships, may trade 1 good for another via bank  
- **Preservation (LATE):** Spend 1 pottery to double current food before rolling (max 15)  
- **Smithing (LATE):** With 5+ skulls, invade opponents without Great Wall for 4 pts each; spend spearheads for +2 pts each  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game ends when:**  
- One player buys their 5th development (6th in longer game), OR  
- All monuments have been completed by at least one player  

*Note: 2-player uses 5-dev limit; 3-player uses 6-dev; 4-player uses 7-dev (per QR source)*

**Final Scoring:**  
1. Add points from:  
   - Completed Developments (circled)  
   - Completed Monuments (circled value)  
2. Add Bonus Points:  
   - **Architecture:** +1 per completed monument  
   - **Empire:** +1 per city (including starting 3)  
3. Subtract 1 point per checked disaster box  

**Winning:** Highest total wins. Tiebreaker: Most valuable remaining goods (sum track values).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Max Dice:** 7 (from 3 starting + 4 cities)  
- **Max Food:** 15; excess beyond that is lost  
- **Goods Spending:** Must spend entire good type; no partial spending or change  
- **Monument Availability:** Once first player completes a monument, others can still complete it for lower points  
- **Disaster Tracking:** Checked boxes count as -1 point each at end  
- **Solitaire Rules:** Play 10 full rounds; all monuments active; Pestilence and Revolt affect you; reroll skulls allowed
