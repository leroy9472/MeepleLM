## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In a dystopian futuristic arena, five combatants battle using advanced weaponry. The objective is to score the most points by damaging and eliminating opponents. Though the setting is grim, the game is a stylized, over-the-top experience where players respawn after being killed. Victory is determined through scoring damage, killshots, and performance in the final frenzy.

2. Components  
- Game board: 2 double-sided pieces, forming 4 arena configurations  
- 1 killshot track board (used in Deathmatch mode)  
- 1 domination board (for Domination Mode)  
- 1 turret board (for Turret Mode)  
- 21 weapon cards  
- 24 powerup cards  
- 36 ammo tiles  
- 5 player sets (each includes):  
  - 1 player board  
  - 1 figure  
  - 1 action tile  
  - 20 damage tokens  
  - 3 ammo cubes in each color (red, yellow, green)  
- Point tokens (unspecified quantity)  
- 1 bot card (used in games with a bot)  
- 8 skulls (used on killshot or skull box track)

3. Setup  
- Choose two sides of the game board to assemble the arena. Recommended configuration depends on player count:  
  - 3–4 players: Use the smaller map  
  - 4–5 players: Use the larger map  
  - Any number: Use the balanced map  
- Place 5 to 8 skulls on the killshot track. 5 is recommended for first games; 8 for standard play.  
- Shuffle powerup cards and place them face-down near the board.  
- Shuffle weapon cards and place them face-down near the board.  
- Deal 3 weapon cards face up to each spawnpoint.  
- Shuffle ammo tiles and place one face-down on each non-spawnpoint square.  
- Place point tokens near the board.  
- Choose a starting player and give them the starting player marker.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Players take turns clockwise.  
- On your first turn:  
  1. Draw 2 powerup cards.  
  2. Choose 1 to keep.  
  3. Reveal the other; spawn on the spawnpoint matching its color.  
  4. Discard the revealed card.  
- On each turn, perform 2 actions (in any order, may repeat):  
  a. Run Around: Move 1–3 squares.  
  b. Grab Stuff: Move 1 square (or 2 with 3+ damage), then take the item in that square.  
  c. Shoot People: Play a weapon card, target legally, pay costs, deal damage.  
- At end of turn:  
  1. Reload any number of unloaded weapons by paying full reload cost.  
  2. Score any player boards that received a killshot (11th damage).  
  3. Replace grabbed ammo tiles and weapons at spawnpoints.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Movement: Adjacent squares only (not diagonal); through doors, not walls.  
- Grabbing Ammo: Remove tile, take depicted ammo cubes (max 3 per color), draw powerup if shown, discard tile.  
- Grabbing Weapons: On spawnpoint, choose one of three weapons. Pay cost shown (top cube is free). If holding 3 weapons, drop one (place it back at spawnpoint, becomes grabbable).  
- Shooting: Play weapon from hand, pay optional/alternate mode costs (via ammo or powerup discard), resolve effects. Weapon becomes unloaded.  
- Adrenaline Actions:  
  - With 3+ damage: Grab Stuff allows up to 2 moves before grabbing.  
  - With 6+ damage: Shoot People allows 1 move before shooting.  
- Marks: Placed on opponents via weapons or powerups. When you damage a marked player, all your marks on them convert to damage. Max 3 marks per player from you.  
- Damage & Death:  
  - 11th damage = killshot. 12th = overkill. >12 = wasted.  
  - When killed: score the board, reset damage, draw 1 powerup, discard 1, respawn at spawnpoint matching discarded card.  
  - Overkill grants a revenge mark to the victim, who gives it to the attacker.  
- Scoring on Death:  
  - First Blood: 1 point to first damager.  
  - Damage Points: 8/6/4/2 to top four damagers. Ties broken by earliest damage.  
  - Killshot token goes to killshot track. Overkill token placed on same space.  
  - Skull from track placed on dead player’s board, reducing future scoring value.  
  - Diminishing rewards: Each prior kill reduces top damage reward (8→6→4→...).

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Standard (Final Frenzy) End Condition: Triggered when last skull is removed from killshot track.  
  - All undamaged players flip boards to low-reward side (2/1/1/1 for damage).  
  - All players take one final turn.  
  - Final turn actions depend on turn order:  
    - Before starting player: Choose 2 from:  
      - Move up to 4 squares  
      - Move up to 2, grab  
      - Move up to 1, reload, shoot  
    - Starting player and after: Choose 1 from:  
      - Move up to 3, grab  
      - Move up to 2, reload, shoot  
  - Score any boards killed during final frenzy (flipped to 2-1-1-1 side).  
- Final Scoring:  
  - Score all remaining damaged boards normally (no killshot).  
  - Score killshot track: 8/6/4/2/1 for most tokens. Tiebreaker: earlier killshot wins.  
  - Total points. Highest wins.  
- Tiebreaker: Player with more killshot track points wins. If still tied, players without killshots remain tied (and are mocked).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can you shoot yourself? No. You cannot be damaged by your own weapon.  
- Can you move after grabbing or shooting? No. Actions do not allow move-after-effect. Adrenaline actions allow move-before.  
- What happens to marks when a player respawns? Marks remain on the board.  
- Can you exceed 3 powerups? Only when respawning — draw one, then discard one to return to 3.  
- Can you use multiple powerups on one action? Yes, if applicable.  
- Can you use Targeting Scope on a mark-only effect? No — it requires dealing damage.  
- Can you use Newton or Teleporter on the bot? Newton: yes. Teleporter: no.  
- What happens if multiple players die on one turn? All are scored. Double kill bonus (+1 point) if you caused two kills.  
- Can you damage a spawnpoint? Yes, in Domination Mode — it tags the spawnpoint.  
- Can you commandeer a turret without taking ammo? Yes — when grabbing ammo on a turret square, you may forgo a cube or card to place your token on the turret instead.  
- Does turret damage trigger marks? No — turret damage does not convert marks to damage.
