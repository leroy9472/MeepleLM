### 3. Setup  

1. **Use 3-player setup rules** for map and initial token placement, with the following modifications:  
   - Omit Step 7 of the standard 3-player setup.  
   - Instead, choose **two other wolf pack colors** to represent AI opponents.

2. **AI Player Boards**:  
   - Take the wolf-art side of each AI’s player board to track their region scoring tokens and prey tokens.

3. **Place AI Starting Units**:  
   - For **each AI color**:  
     - Place **1 Lair and 1 Alpha Wolf** on the top-right hex of a water source on two **different tiles**, neither of which has a crescent moon token.  
     - Place **1 pair of pack wolves** (2 Pack Wolves) on the top-right and lower-left hexes of a water source that:
       - Does **not** already have a Lair and Alpha, and  
       - Does **not** have a crescent moon token.

4. **Prepare AI Action System**:  
   - Place the **5 AI action tiles** (Grasslands, Cliffs, Tundra, Desert, Forests) into a cup or bag.  
   - Shuffle thoroughly.

5. **Player Setup**:  
   - Set up your own player board and place your wolves following standard 3-player snake draft rules.  
   - As the first player, take **1 Bonus Action Token**.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

#### Player Turns  
- On your turn, take **any 2 actions** (can be the same action twice).  
- Pay action costs by flipping terrain tiles matching the destination hex.  
- You may take **additional actions** by spending Bonus Action Tokens.  
- After actions, check the Moonlight Board: if a component was placed on a moon phase matching player count, trigger **Region Scoring** for matching tokens.

#### AI Turns  
After your turn, resolve **one AI activation per AI pack** (in any order). For each:  
1. Draw **one random action tile** from the bag.  
2. Resolve the corresponding action.  
3. **AI performs only one action per turn**, even if multiple effects could trigger.  
4. Return the tile to the bag after use (unless specified otherwise).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### AI Action Tile Effects  

**Grasslands** – Move Wolves  
- Move up to **2 of the AI’s pieces** (1 Alpha + 1 Pack Wolf) up to **3 hexes each**.  
- Target: Nearest **current region scoring tile** with the most of their color.  
- Priority for movement:  
  1. Region with most of their color.  
  2. Region with no presence.  
- If control is even across regions, split movement toward respective tiles.  
- If AI already **dominates** the region (most control), **flip the tile** and perform the action on the back.

**Cliffs** – Build Den  
- An Alpha Wolf builds a **Den** on its current space or adjacent space (if space is not occupied by two pieces).  
- Must be adjacent to Alpha.  
- Cannot build on enemy Pack Wolf or over another territory marker.

**Tundra** – Build Lair  
- An Alpha Wolf upgrades a **Den of their color** into a **Lair**.  
- Requirements:  
  - Den must be adjacent to **Water Source** and occupied or adjacent to AI Alpha.  
- If AI already has a Lair on that tile, **flip the tile** and do the back-side action.  
- If back-side action is impossible, **draw a new tile**.

**Desert** – Howl at Lone Wolf  
- An Alpha Wolf **converts a Lone Wolf token** 1–2 hexes away into a **Pack Wolf** of their color.  
- The **third** Lone Wolf converted by this AI becomes an **Alpha Wolf** instead.  
- If no Lone Wolves are nearby, **flip the tile** and do the back-side action.  
- If back-side action is impossible, **draw a new tile**.

**Forests** – Dominate Enemy Wolf  
- An Alpha Wolf **converts** an enemy wolf (player or other AI) 1–2 hexes away into their **Pack Wolf**.  
- The **third** such domination converts the enemy into their **Alpha Wolf**.  
- If no valid targets, **flip the tile** and do the back-side action.  
- If back-side action is impossible, **draw a new tile**.

#### AI Behavior Rules  
- AI follows **same movement and placement rules** as players.  
- AI **prioritizes region scoring tiles** with the most control.  
- AI **cannot be dominated or moved** by the player.  
- AI **gains prey tokens** when first to have 3 of their color surrounding a prey stack.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Triggering End Game  
- Game ends **immediately** when a component is placed on the **Full Moon** space of the Moonlight Board (player-count-specific).  
- Final scoring occurs after that player’s turn concludes.

#### Player Scoring  
- Standard scoring:  
  - VP from **Region Scoring Tokens** won.  
  - VP from **Hunting Track** (one of each prey type).  
  - VP from **Player Board tracks** (Lairs, Attributes, etc.).

#### AI Scoring  
AI earns VP as follows:  
- **Victory Points** from Region Scoring phases (same as players).  
- **2 VP** per remaining **Pack Wolf** on the board.  
- **4 VP** per **Den** of their color.  
- **6 VP** per **Alpha Wolf**.  
- **8 VP** per **Prey Token** collected.  
- **10 VP** per **Lair**.

*Total AI score = sum of all above.*

#### Winning the Game  
- You win if your **total VP > both AI packs’ VP**.  
- Tie-breakers (if applicable):  
  1. Most Region Scoring Tokens.  
  2. Most wolves on the board.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can AI flip tiles multiple times during a turn?**  
A: No. Only one action per AI per turn.

**Q: What if the AI draws an action they can’t perform and the flipped side also can’t be done?**  
A: Draw a new tile until a valid action can be performed.

**Q: Can AI dominate another AI’s wolf?**  
A: Yes. "Enemy wolf" includes both player and other AI packs.

**Q: Do AI packs trigger region scoring?**  
A: Yes. Placing any piece (Den, Wolf, etc.) on the Moonlight Board can trigger scoring.

**Q: Can AI build a Lair on a tile without water?**  
A: No. Must be adjacent to Water Source, per standard rules.

**Q: Do AI packs earn Bonus Action Tokens from hunting?**  
A: No. Only VP. Bonus Actions are player-only.

**Q: What happens when AI surrounds prey?**  
A: They immediately take the **top prey token**, place it on their player board, and gain **8 VP at endgame**.
