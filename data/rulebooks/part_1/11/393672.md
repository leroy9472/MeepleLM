### 4. Gameplay Flow  

#### START OF ROUND  
1. **Select 2 Cards**: Choose two ability cards to play. The top ability from one card and the bottom ability from the other will be used this round.  
2. **Choose Initiative Card**: Designate one of the two selected cards as your initiative card.  
3. **Monster Action Resolution**: For each monster type with at least one figure on the board:  
   - Roll the monster action die.  
   - Move the white initiative cube to the action indicated by the die result on the monster stat sheet.  
4. **Determine Initiative Order**:  
   - Compare initiative values (top number in each column) on your initiative card and all rolled monster actions.  
   - Turn order proceeds from **lowest to highest** initiative value.  
   - **Tie Rules**:  
     a. If tied with a monster, the character acts first.  
     b. All monsters of the same type act at the same initiative, in ascending numeric order (e.g., Monster 1, then Monster 2, etc.).  
   - **Long Rest Rule**: If long resting, character acts on initiative 99.

#### CHARACTER AND MONSTER TURNS  
1. **Perform Actions**: Execute the two chosen abilities (top from one card, bottom from the other) in any order.  
2. **Attacking Procedure**:  
   a. **Attack Modifiers Include**:  
      - Fixed bonuses/penalties (e.g., +1, –1) from abilities or conditions (e.g., poison).  
      - Attack modifier die result.  
      - Target’s shield bonus (reduces incoming damage).  
   b. **One Modifier per Target**: Each individual target in an attack receives a separate attack modifier die roll.  
   c. **Roll Die**: Roll the attack modifier die and use the value at the intersection of the current row and the die face column (e.g., $, , $).  
   d. **Apply Modifier**: Add or subtract the rolled value from the base attack value.  
   e. **Move Tracker**: After resolving the modifier, move the attack modifier tracker cube down one row on the modifier table.  
3. **Advantage and Disadvantage**:  
   a. **Advantage**: Roll two modifier dice on the same row; attacker chooses one. Monsters always pick the better result.  
   b. **Disadvantage**: Roll two modifier dice on the same row; attacker must use the worse result.  
   c. **Interaction Rules**:  
      - Multiple instances of advantage or disadvantage do not stack.  
      - If both advantage and disadvantage apply, they cancel out (treat as neither).  
   d. **Ranged Adjacent Penalty**: Any ranged attack against an adjacent enemy automatically suffers disadvantage.

#### END OF ROUND  
1. **Trigger End-of-Round Effects**: Resolve any scenario, item, or card effects that trigger at the end of the round.  
2. **Update Active Ability Cards**:  
   a. **A-side in Active Area**: Flip to B-side and return to hand.  
   b. **B-side in Active Area**: Place in discard pile.  
   c. **Lost Icon**: If the card has the lost icon, place it in the lost pile (regardless of side).  
3. **Short Rest Opportunity**:  
   - If you have at least two cards in your hand and/or discard pile, you may perform a short rest.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### RESTING  
Resting allows recovery of cards but requires losing one card.  
- **Eligibility**: Must have at least two cards in hand and/or discard pile (includes persistent B-side cards not used with lost icon).  

**Short Rest (End of Round)**:  
1. Return all discard pile cards to hand.  
2. Flip all B-side cards in hand to A-side.  
3. Lose one card at random from hand.  
   - Optionally, suffer 1 damage to reject the lost card and lose a different random card instead (once per short rest).  

**Long Rest (Card Selection Step)**:  
1. Declare long rest — this is your entire turn.  
2. Acts on initiative 99.  
3. Steps:  
   a. Return all discard pile cards to hand.  
   b. Flip all B-side cards in hand to A-side.  
   c. Lose one card of your choice from hand (mandatory).  
   d. Optionally perform "Heal 2, self".  
   e. Optionally recover all spent items (can be used the same turn).  

**Card Loss During Rest**:  
- Must lose a card.  
- If no hand cards, lose from active area (only cards without lost icon).  
- If no valid cards to lose, complete rest steps and check for exhaustion next round.

#### LOST ACTIONS  
1. Actions with the **lost icon** require placing the card in the lost pile after use (even partial use).  
2. If used for an active bonus, the card moves to the lost pile when the bonus ends.  
3. If the lost action has a **special icon** (implied unrecoverable):  
   - Place in lost pile **upside down** (rotated 180°).  
   - Cannot be recovered until the end of the scenario.

#### CHARACTER DAMAGE  
When damage is dealt:  
- **Option 1**: Reduce hit point dial by full amount.  
- **Option 2**: Negate damage by discarding or losing cards:  
   - Discard one A-side card from hand, **or**  
   - Discard two B-side cards from hand, **or**  
   - Lose one card from hand or discard pile.  
- Cards selected during Card Selection step are not yet in hand/discard and **cannot** be used to negate damage.  
- **Note**: Even if damage is negated, **conditions or effects** from the source still apply.

#### EXHAUSTION  
A character is exhausted and loses the scenario if either occurs at the **start of a round**:  
- Hit points reduced to 0.  
- Fewer than two cards in hand **and** fewer than two cards total in hand + discard pile (required to rest).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Not specified in source. Omitted.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I rest if all my cards are in play?**  
  No — you must have at least two cards in hand and/or discard pile to rest.  

- **Can I use a recovered item the same turn I long rest?**  
  Yes — item recovery during long rest allows immediate use.  

- **What happens if I negate all damage with cards but am at 1 HP?**  
  You remain in play as long as HP > 0 and have sufficient cards.  

- **Do conditions apply even if damage is negated?**  
  Yes — poison, stun, etc., from an attack still take effect.  

- **Can I gain advantage/disadvantage more than once?**  
  No — multiple instances do not stack. If both are present, they cancel.  

- **Ranged attack on adjacent enemy?**  
  Automatically has disadvantage, regardless of other factors.
