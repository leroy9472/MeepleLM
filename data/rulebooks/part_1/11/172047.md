## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The city is under siege by supernatural forces embodied by one of the Seven Sins. The Sin player controls monstrous entities and corruptive influences threatening humanity. The Hero players control agents of F.A.I.T.H., tasked with completing story-specific missions to save the city. Victory is achieved by completing all missions in sequence. The Sin player wins if the hero reserve is depleted (i.e., a hero dies with no replacement available).
