### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 7 seasons. Each season has two phases:

#### Open Season Phase (Skip steps 1–5 in Pre-Season)  
1. **Determine Player Order**: By reputation (tiebreak: facilities, credits).  
2. **Assign Visitors**:  
   - First player takes all visitors in their column.  
   - Bonus visitors: First player may take 2, then players take 1 each in order until supply or space runs out.  
3. **Receive Credits**: 1 credit per visitor.  
4. **Resolve Breaking News**: Move upcoming card to active; resolve effect. Draw new upcoming card.  
5. **Refresh City Center**: Draw 1 tile to 2nd/3rd/4th facility stacks. Replace if empty.  
6. **Draw Specialists**: 2 new to Job Market; push existing to Independent Contractor space.  
7. **Worker Placement**: In player order, place 1 worker per turn on unoccupied action spaces until all are placed.  
8. **Proceed to Upkeep**.

#### Upkeep Phase  
1. **Feed Carnivores**: Must feed as much as possible.  
   - Tyrannosaurus: 2 goats, Pterodactyl/Raptor: 1 goat.  
   - Fishery reduces aquatic carnivore cost by 1.  
   - Mutants: May feed 2 goats to spawn another mutant (once per season).  
2. **Rampage Checks**: For:  
   - Invalid pen size/enclosure (Brontosaurus exempt).  
   - Multiple species in habitat (Ankylosaurus exempt).  
   - Brontosaurus penned or open space shared.  
   - Pterodactyl not in Biodome.  
   - Unfed carnivore.  
   - Roll one die per dinosaur (Tyrannosaurus rolls two).  
3. **Score Visitor VPs**: Gain 3 VP per 2 surviving visitors. Return all to supply.  
4. **Score Dinosaur & Facility VPs**:  
   - Stegosaurus: +1 credit each.  
   - Triceratops Observatory: +1 VP per triceratops in others’ parks.  
   - Petting Zoo: +1 VP per species with ≥2 individuals.  
   - Park Mascot: +1 VP per unique species.  
   - Tour Bus: +1 VP per player ahead in order.  
   - Fine Diner: +1 VP per hotel.  
   - Food Court: +1 credit per hotel.  
5. **Return Workers** to owners.  
6. **Advance Visitor Overlay** one column left.  
7. **Next Season**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Dinosaur Cloning (DinoGenics IOM Action)  
- Discard exact DNA requirement to place dinosaur.  
- Mutant: Discard any 3 DNA cards.  
- DNA Splice (Manipulation Card): Discard requirement +1 DNA; placed dinosaur must match one discarded.  

#### Habitat Rules  
- **Pen Requirements**: Must meet minimum fenced spaces and be fully enclosed (Brontosaurus exempt).  
- **Biodome**: Counts as any-sized pen; holds up to 2 compatible dinosaurs (same species or with Ankylosaurus). Satisfies Pterodactyl flight requirement.  
- **Aquatic Habitats**: Size 1 (Ichthyosaur, Plesiosaurus) or Size 2 (Megalodon, Mosasaur, Spinosaurus). Size 1 can share.  
- **Open Space**: Only for Brontosaurus and Dreadnoughtus; must be unpenned and unshared.  

#### Rampage Checks  
Triggered when placing or during Upkeep if:  
- Pen invalid.  
- Species cohabitation (Ankylosaurus exempt).  
- Brontosaurus penned or open space shared.  
- Pterodactyl not in Biodome.  
- Carnivore unfed.  

**Die Results (6-sided)**:  
- **Rampage Fatality (2/6)**: Kill 1 visitor (gain Scandal), damage accessible structure.  
- **Rampage Slash (3/6)**: Damage accessible structure.  
- **Naïve Visitor (1/6)**: Gain 1 credit if ≥1 visitor present.  

**Special Rules**:  
- **Tyrannosaurus**: Roll two dice; apply both results.  
- **Raptor**: On Slash, also cause 1 visitor fatality (gains Scandal).  
- **Pachycephalosaurus**: At start of Upkeep, if bordering another species’ habitat (not open space), resolve Rampage Check and gain 3 VP.  
- **Spinosaurus**: Destroy 1 dinosaur in park when placed or during Upkeep feeding.  

**Structure Damage Priority**:  
1. Facility in pen or adjacent.  
2. Closest fence to edge (destroyed = open space).  
3. Commercial facility (player’s choice).  
4. Damaged hotel kills all visitors inside (Scandal per death).  
5. Visitor Center: No damage, but gain extra Scandal if targeted.  

**Cascading Rampages**: If one rampage damages a structure causing another dinosaur to violate rules, it must also rampage.  

#### Feeding & Resources  
- **Goats**: Gained from Goat Farm (1/season), Farm action (+3).  
- **Fishery**: Reduces aquatic carnivore feeding cost by 1.  
- **Plesiosaurus**: Does not require feeding.  
- **Mutant**: Optional feeding (2 goats) to spawn new mutant (once/season).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Corrupted T-Rex**: Resolves rampage check every feeding stage; ignores placement checks.  
- **Therizinosaurus**: Gains 3 VP per season if in habitat of 4+ spaces.  
- **Triceratops**: +1 dinosaur value per every 2 in shared pen.  
- **Pachycephalosaurus**: Gains 3 VP if bordering another species’ habitat (not open space) at start of Upkeep.  
- **Fence Rearrangement**: Allowed when placing fences, using manipulation, or after breaking news.
