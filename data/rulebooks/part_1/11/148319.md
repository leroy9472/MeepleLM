## Tragedy Looper — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
**Lore:**  
The Protagonists possess the ability to loop back in time to prevent recurring tragedies. However, a hidden Mastermind is orchestrating events to ensure the tragedy unfolds regardless of their efforts. Each loop allows the Protagonists to gather more information about roles, plots, and culprits.  

**Objective:**  
- **Protagonists win** by surviving one full loop without triggering any loss condition.  
- If the Protagonists fail all loops, in advanced scenarios they may still win via a **Final Guess** (correctly identifying all character roles).  
- **Mastermind wins** if the Protagonists fail every loop *and* fail the Final Guess (if applicable).  

In **First Steps** scenarios, there is **no Final Guess** — survival is the only path to victory.

### 2. Components  
- Character cards (with abilities, Paranoia limit, Goodwill requirement)  
- Location boards (School, Shrine, City, Hospital in First Steps)  
- Card decks:  
  - Protagonist action cards (Goodwill, Paranoia, Movement, Forbidden cards)  
  - Mastermind action cards (Intrigue, Paranoia, Movement, Forbidden cards)  
- Tokens:  
  - Goodwill ( )  
  - Paranoia ( )  
  - Intrigue ( )  
- Loop and Day trackers  
- Leader token  
- Plot/Role/Incident summary sheets  
- Script cards (define Set, plots, subplots, incidents, loop/day count)

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Select a **Script** from a Set (e.g., First Steps).  
2. Reveal:  
   - Number of loops  
   - Number of days per loop  
   - List of possible plots and subplots  
   - List of scheduled Incidents (day + description)  
3. Place characters in starting locations (e.g., Doctor and Patient in Hospital).  
4. Shuffle Protagonist decks and deal to players.  
5. Mastermind reviews secret scenario card (active plot/subplot, roles, culprits).  
6. Place Loop counter at max, Day counter at 1.  
7. Give Leader token to starting player.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each **Day** has 5 phases:

#### 1. Morning Phase  
- Plot- or role-triggered effects may occur (Mastermind resolves silently).

#### 2. Playing Cards Phase  
- **Mastermind** plays **3 cards face-down**, max 1 per character/location.  
- **Protagonists** each play **1 card face-down**, starting with Leader.  
  - Max 1 Protagonist card per character/location.  
  - May play on same target as Mastermind.  
  - Cards not used yet may be saved for later.

#### 3. Resolve Cards (Mastermind)  
Cards resolve in this order:  
1. **Forbidden Movement** → cancels movement.  
2. **Movement cards** → combine if opposing directions (e.g., vertical + horizontal = diagonal).  
   - Movement to **forbidden location** (e.g., Shrine Maiden to City) is **canceled**.  
3. **Other Forbidden cards** (e.g., Forbid Goodwill, Forbid Paranoia).  
4. **All other cards** (Goodwill, Paranoia, Intrigue, etc.).  
- **Once-per-loop cards** are set aside until loop reset.

#### 4. Abilities Phase  
- **Mastermind Abilities**:  
  - Use hidden role abilities (e.g., Conspiracy Theorist places Paranoia).  
  - Announce only the **result**, not the role or reason.  
- **Protagonist Goodwill Abilities**:  
  - Leader declares use of a character’s ability if they meet Goodwill threshold.  
  - Mastermind resolves outcome.  
  - **Goodwill tokens are not removed**.  
  - Some roles allow or require **Goodwill refusal**.

#### 5. Incidents Phase  
- For each **scheduled Incident**:  
  - If **culprit is alive** and has **Paranoia ≥ their Paranoia limit**:  
    - Incident **occurs**.  
    - If no valid target, **effect fails**, but Mastermind says: “The incident occurs, but nothing happens.”  
  - Else: Mastermind says: “Nothing happens.”  
- **No character can be culprit of more than one Incident.**

#### 6. Night-time Phase  
- Pass Leader token clockwise.  
- Some roles/plot effects trigger at night (e.g., Serial Killer).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Character Stats  
- **Goodwill ( )**:  
  - Placed only by Protagonists.  
  - Enables use of character’s Goodwill ability when threshold is met.  
  - Not removed when used.  
- **Paranoia ( )**:  
  - Placed by either side.  
  - Triggers **Incidents** when culprit reaches their Paranoia limit.  
- **Intrigue ( )**:  
  - Placed only by Mastermind.  
  - Triggers **Roles** and **Plot loss conditions**.  
  - Can be placed on **characters or locations**.  

#### Card Interactions  
- **Forbidden Movement**: cancels any movement on same character.  
- **Movement Combinations**:  
  - Vertical + Horizontal = Diagonal  
  - Diagonal + Vertical = Horizontal (and vice versa)  
  - Same direction cards **do not cancel**.  
- **Forbidden Intrigue**:  
  - Only one Protagonist may play this per day.  
  - If **two or more** are played, **all are canceled**.  
- **Bluffing**:  
  - Mastermind may play non-Intrigue cards on locations (no effect, for bluff).  
  - Protagonists have no reason to bluff.

#### Roles, Plots & Subplots  
- **Plots and subplots determine which roles are in play.**  
  - E.g., *Murder Plan* → includes Killer, Key Person, Brain.  
  - *An Unsettling Rumor* → includes Conspiracy Theorist.  
- Each character has **at most one role**.  
- Roles not tied to plot are **"Person"**.  
- Roles may grant Mastermind abilities (e.g., Brain places Intrigue).  

#### Incidents  
- Independent of plots/roles.  
- Each has:  
  - Scheduled day  
  - One culprit (any character)  
  - Possible target requirement  
- Culprit must be alive and at Paranoia limit to trigger.  

#### Table Talk  
- **Recommended rule**: Players may not tell each other what cards they are playing.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Loop ends** when:  
  - Final day is completed.  
  - A **loss condition is triggered** (immediate reset).  
- **Loss conditions** (restart loop):  
  1. **Plot/Role-based**:  
     - E.g., 2+ Intrigue on School (Place to Protect).  
     - E.g., Key Person dies.  
  2. **Incident-based**:  
     - E.g., Protagonists killed.  
  3. **Loop End Condition**:  
     - Some plots cause loss **if condition is met at loop end**.  
- **Mastermind must reveal** if loss was due to Protagonist death.  
- **Board resets** on loop loss:  
  - Characters to starting positions.  
  - All tokens removed.  
  - Cards reset.  
- **Protagonists win** if they complete **any one loop** without loss.  
- **Final Guess** (advanced only):  
  - After last loop, guess all roles.  
  - Win if all correct.  
  - **Not available in First Steps**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can two movement cards cancel?**  
  Only if they result in movement to a **forbidden location** (e.g., diagonal move to City for Shrine Maiden). Otherwise, they combine.  
- **What happens if two Forbidden Intrigue cards are played?**  
  They **cancel each other**, even on different locations.  
- **Does using Goodwill remove tokens?**  
  No. Tokens stay; ability can be used multiple times if threshold is met.  
- **Can a character without a role be an Incident culprit?**  
  Yes. Any character can be a culprit.  
- **Can a character have no role and no incident?**  
  Yes.  
- **Does triggering an Incident restart the loop?**  
  No. Only if it triggers a **loss condition** (e.g., kills Key Person).  
- **Can Mastermind play Intrigue on a location?**  
  Yes. Some plots use location-based Intrigue.  
- **Can Protagonists play cards on locations?**  
  Only **Forbidden Intrigue** (to block). Other cards have no effect.  
- **Is Paranoia removed during reset?**  
  Yes. All tokens and positions reset.  
- **Can Goodwill be used on a dead character?**  
  No. Character must be alive to use ability.
