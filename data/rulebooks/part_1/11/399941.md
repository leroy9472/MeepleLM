## River of Gold – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the realm of Rokugan, the River of Gold flows through six distinct regions, symbolizing prosperity and trade. Players take on the role of influential merchants from one of four clans—the Crab, Crane, Mantis, or Scorpion—seeking to build trade empires by constructing buildings, sailing ships, and delivering goods to customers. The goal is to earn the most victory points by gaining regional influence, claiming masteries, completing customer deliveries, and scoring during final endgame evaluation.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, follow these steps in order:  
1. **Spend Divine Favor** (optional)  
2. **Take an Action** (choose one):  
   - Build a Building  
   - Sail a Ship  
   - Deliver to a Customer  
3. **Claim Masteries** (if eligible)  
4. **Roll Your Die** (end turn)

Turns proceed clockwise until game end is triggered.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Spend Divine Favor  
- Spend 1 divine favor to increase or decrease your die result by 1.  
- Results wrap: 6+1 = 1; 1–1 = 6.  
- Sun marker tracks current favor.  
- Moon marker sets maximum storage.  
- Cannot exceed moon marker; excess favor is lost.

#### Build a Building  
- **Prerequisites**: Die shows region number; at least one empty shore space in that region; sufficient Koku.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Pay Koku cost printed on the shore space.  
  2. Choose any building tile from the building row.  
  3. Place it on an empty shore space in the matching region.  
  4. If you took the last tile in the row, gain 1 divine favor.  
  5. Place a clan marker on the build bonus and gain that influence in the region.  
  6. Move your influence marker along the track, collecting rewards passed or reached.  
- **Refill Building Row**: Slide tiles left; draw new from Era 1 (or Era 2 after Emperor’s Visit).  
- **Game Triggers**:  
  - Last Era 1 tile moved → Emperor’s Visit (end of turn).  
  - Last Era 2 tile moved → Game end triggered (end of turn).

#### Sail a Ship  
- **Prerequisites**: Must own at least one ship (Standard or Royal).  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Choose one of your ships.  
  2. Move it downriver by die value (count only gold spaces).  
  3. If ship goes off the river, return it to the top starting space and continue movement ("completing your journey").  
  4. **Visitor Rewards**: Collect from each of the 4 adjacent shore spaces:  
     - Building present: take visitor reward (shown on pointed end).  
     - Empty space: gain 1 Koku.  
  5. **Owner Rewards**: All owners of buildings touched collect owner rewards (flat end).  
     - Starting and Imperial Market buildings grant no owner rewards.  
  6. **End of River Bonus**: If ship completes journey, gain 3 Koku **or** 1 trade good of your choice.  
  7. Discard the last tile in the building row and refill as normal.  
- Triggers same era transitions as Build action.

#### Deliver to a Customer  
- **Prerequisites**: Die matches region number on customer card; you have required trade goods.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Choose one eligible customer card from hand.  
  2. Discard trade goods matching the order.  
  3. Place card faceup near your clan board.  
  4. Gain delivery rewards (e.g., influence, upgrade ship, etc.).  
  5. Draw 2 new customer cards.  
  6. Discard 1 card from hand (faceup).  
     - If deck is empty, reshuffle discard pile.  
- Ongoing abilities activate immediately if applicable.

#### Claim Masteries  
- After taking your action, check all 3 revealed mastery cards.  
- If you meet or exceed the requirement, claim the highest unclaimed reward on that card.  
- Place a clan marker on the reward space and score the listed points.  
- Each mastery can be claimed only once.  
- Multiple masteries may be claimed per turn.

#### Roll Your Die  
- At the end of your turn, roll your die for use on your next turn.

#### Resource Management  
- **Maximums**:  
  - 25 Koku  
  - 6 of any one trade good (Silk, Rice, Porcelain)  
- Excess resources are lost when gained.  
- **Exchanges (at any time)**:  
  - 2 of the same trade good → 1 of any other trade good  
  - 5 Koku → 1 divine favor (advance sun marker by 1)

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End Trigger  
- When the last Era 2 tile is moved to the building row, the active player triggers the game end at the end of their turn.  
- That player scores.  
- Each other player takes **one additional turn**.  
- Then proceed to final scoring.

#### Final Scoring  
Each player scores:  

1. **Regional Influence** (per region):  
   - Award points based on region scoring tile (1st, 2nd, sometimes 3rd).  
   - Players with no influence in a region score 0.  
   - Ties: Sum tied positions’ points, divide evenly (round down).  
   - **Elder Bonus**: If you delivered to an Elder in the region, **double** your score for that region.  
     - Applies only to endgame scoring, not track rewards.  

2. **Customers Delivered**:  
   - 1 point per customer delivered.  

3. **Customer Endgame Bonuses**:  
   - **Merchants**: 1 point per 5 leftover Koku (rounded down) – per merchant.  
   - **Nobles**: 1 point per building of specified type you own – per noble.  
   - **Artisans**: 1 point per 3 leftover trade goods (rounded down) – per artisan.  
   - **Elders**: Already scored via regional doubling.  
   - **Monks**: No endgame bonus.  

#### Winning  
- Highest total score wins.  
- Tiebreaker:  
  1. Most leftover divine favor.  
  2. If still tied, share victory.

#### 2-Player Scoring Adjustment  
- On region scoring tiles, the second point value is used **only if** the 2nd-place player is within 5 spaces of 1st place.  
- Otherwise, 2nd place scores 0.
