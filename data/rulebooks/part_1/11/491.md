## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Kardinal & König (Cardinal and King), set in 12th-century Europe, challenges players to expand religious influence across nine countries. Players represent religious orders placing monasteries (cloisters) and counsellors (advisors) to gain supremacy. The goal is to score the most points through strategic placement, majority control, alliances, and monastery chains. The player with the highest score at the end wins; ties are broken by the player with the most remaining tokens.

2. **Components**  
- 55 playing cards (color-coded by region):  
  - Green: Bayern (Bavaria) & Burgundy (12 cards)  
  - Blue: Franken & Aragon (13 cards)  
  - Yellow: Lothringen (Lorraine) & Italien (Italy) (11 cards)  
  - Red: England & Schwaben (10 cards)  
  - Purple: Frankreich (France) (9 cards)  
- 100 monastery tokens (20 each in 5 colors)  
- 40 advisor/counsellor tokens (8 each in 5 colors)  
- 5 scoring markers (one per color)  
- 1 black start player marker  
- Game board depicting 9 European countries, roads, circular advisor seals, and 15 alliance squares (numbered 1–15)  
- Optional components for variants: Vatican board, King color set, Special Action cards

3. **Setup**  
- Place board in center. Each player chooses a color and takes all matching monasteries, advisors, and scoring marker. Place marker at 0 on score track.  
- Determine starting player; they receive black start marker.  
- Adjust card deck:  
  - 5 players: Use all 55 cards  
  - 4 players: Remove 1 card of each color  
  - 3 players: Remove 2 cards of each color  
- Shuffle remaining deck. Deal 3 cards face-down to each player. Place deck face-down beside board. Reveal top 2 cards face-up.  
- (Optional variants add extra setup steps, e.g., Vatican board, King’s hand, etc.)

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Players take turns clockwise, starting with the start player. Each turn consists of:

1. **Play Cards (1–3)**  
   - Choose 1–3 cards from hand.  
   - May discard 1 card instead of placing pieces.  
   - Use cards to place pieces in **one** country (except in 2-player variant).  
   - Each card corresponds to two countries (e.g., green = Bayern or Burgundy); Frankreich cards only for France.  
   - Two cards of same color = "wild" (joker), allowing play in any country.  
   - Max 3 cards played per turn → max 2 pieces placed in one country.

2. **Place Tokens**  
   - In **empty country**: Only **1 monastery** may be placed.  
   - In **non-empty country**: Up to **2 pieces** (monasteries and/or advisors).  
   - **Monastery placement**:  
     - Must be on an empty monastery symbol (location).  
     - One per location only.  
   - **Advisor placement**:  
     - Placed on circular seal.  
     - Max number of advisors in a country = number of monasteries of the player with the most in that country.  
     - Advisors may be placed even if player has no monastery there.  
     - No advisors allowed if no monasteries exist in the country.

3. **Discard Used Cards**  
   - Discard all played cards (except in "The King" variant, where one may be kept).

4. **Replenish Hand**  
   - Draw cards to restore hand to 3.  
   - Choose from: face-up cards or top of draw deck.  
   - Replace any taken face-up cards immediately from deck.  
   - Always maintain 2 face-up cards.

5. **Trigger Intermediate Scoring**  
   - If draw deck is exhausted after replenishing, **immediate intermediate scoring** occurs.  
   - Discard pile is shuffled into a new draw deck.  
   - Unused face-up cards are not shuffled in.  
   - Players refill hands to 3.  
   - Play resumes with player to the left of previous start player.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Card Use**: Cards are dual-use by country pair (except France). Pairs of same color = wild.  
- **Placement Limits**:  
  - 1 piece max in empty country (only monastery).  
  - 2 pieces max per turn, in one country.  
  - Advisors limited by majority monastery count.  
- **Joker Rule**: Two same-color cards = wild; can place in any country.  
- **Passing**: Discarding 1 card is allowed instead of placing pieces.  
- **Hand Management**: Always end turn with 3 cards.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- **Intermediate Scoring**  
  Triggered when draw deck is exhausted the **first** time.  
  Score all countries:  
  - 1st place (most monasteries): 1 point per **all** monasteries in country (any color)  
  - 2nd place: 1 point per monastery of the **1st-place** player  
  - 3rd place: 1 point per monastery of the **2nd-place** player  
  - 4th place: 1 point per monastery of the **3rd-place** player  
  - 5th place: 1 point per monastery of the **4th-place** player  
  - Tie for 1st: All tied players score full total (e.g., sum of all monasteries)  
  - No monasteries = 0 points  

  After scoring:  
  - Shuffle discard pile into new draw deck  
  - Reveal 2 face-up cards  
  - Refill hands  
  - Continue play (next player starts round)

- **Final Scoring** (after second deck exhaustion)  
  Occurs after last player’s turn. All players have equal turns.  
  1. **Repeat Intermediate Scoring** for all countries.  
  2. **Alliance Scoring** (15 numbered squares):  
     - For each alliance (e.g., Square 4 = France + Aragon):  
       - A player scores **only if** they have:  
         a) Advisors in **both** countries  
         b) **Majority** (or tie for most) in **each** country  
         c) Their majority is **at least tied for highest** in both  
       - Score: 1 point per **all** advisors in **both** countries (any color)  
       - Example: Blue has 2 in Italy, 1 in Burgundy; Red has 1 in each → Blue scores total advisors (4+2=6) if conditions met  
       - Tie in a country → all tied have majority  
       - If no player satisfies all conditions → 0 points for that alliance  
  3. **Monastery Chains**:  
     - Score for each **continuous chain of 4 or more** monasteries connected by roads  
     - Count only connected monasteries in a straight path; branches do not count  
     - 1 point per monastery in chain  
     - Chains can cross country borders  
     - Sea routes do not count  

- **Game End Triggers**  
  Game ends when:  
  - Draw deck is exhausted **second** time (after final turn)  
  - OR no more legal moves (all monastery spots filled, advisors maxed, or players out of pieces)  

- **Winning**  
  Highest total score wins. Tiebreaker: player with most unused tokens (monasteries + advisors) wins.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can I play a joker in an empty country?**  
  Yes, but you may only place **1 monastery**.  
- **Can I place 2 advisors in an empty country?**  
  No. No advisors can be placed until at least one monastery exists.  
- **Can I place a monastery and an advisor in same turn?**  
  Yes, if country already has a monastery and advisor limit allows.  
- **What if two players tie for 2nd in monastery count?**  
  Both score points based on the 1st-place player’s monastery count.  
- **Can a player score multiple alliances?**  
  Yes, if they meet criteria in multiple pairs.  
- **Do chains include opponent’s monasteries?**  
  No. Only your own monasteries count toward chain scoring.  
- **Can I use 3 cards to play in two countries?**  
  No. Standard rules limit to **one country per turn**. Only 2-player variant allows split placement.  
- **Can I score an alliance if I have majority in one but not both countries?**  
  No. Majority in **both** is required.
