# JAWS — Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Relive the events of Spielberg’s *Jaws* across two cinematic acts. One player takes the role of the Shark, stalking swimmers and evading detection. The others play the Crew — Quint, Brody, and Hooper — who must track and subdue the predator. In Act 1, the Shark hunts swimmers around Amity Island while the Crew tries to attach tracking barrels. In Act 2, the battle moves to the Orca, where the Crew must destroy the Shark before it sinks the boat or kills them all.

**Victory Conditions:**
- **Shark Wins:** If all 3 Crew Members are eliminated OR the Orca is completely destroyed (all 8 Boat Tiles removed).

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Act 1: Amity Island

#### 1. Event Phase
- Draw top **Amity Event Card**.
- Place swimmers as indicated (e.g., "N W EE" = 1 at North, 1 at West, 2 at East).
- Resolve event text (e.g., bonus actions, special rules).
- **Michael (x2 swimmer)** is only placed if explicitly stated.

#### 2. Shark Phase
- **Actions (up to 3, any order):**
  - **Move:** To adjacent water space (no diagonals).
  - **Eat 1 Swimmer:** Remove 1 swimmer from current space.
- **Power Token (optional, 1 per round, used only once per game):**
  - **Feeding Frenzy:** Eat all swimmers in space as 1 action.
  - **Evasive Moves:** Do not trigger Motion Sensors this round.
  - **Out of Sight:** If Binoculars or Fish Finder are used, say “not there nor nearby” (even if false).
  - **Speed Burst:** Move up to 3 spaces as 1 action (only once per game).

**End of Turn Announcements:**
- **Swimmers Eaten:** State number and beach. Remove swimmers. Advance clip on Swimmer Track. If clip reaches 9, Act 1 ends.
- **Motion Sensors Triggered:** Announce which floating barrels were entered (not when or how many times).
- **Power Token Used:** Announce use, place token face-down in front of you.

#### 3. Crew Phase
Each Crew Member takes up to 4 actions (in any order, one at a time).

**Quint:**
- **Move:** 1 space in water (adjacent only).
- **Rescue 1 Swimmer:** Remove 1 swimmer from current space.
- **Pick Up Barrels:** From dock, water, or Hooper’s boat (each source = 1 action).
- **Launch a Barrel (once/round):** Into own or adjacent water space.
  - If Shark is there: Shark announces hit, attach barrel to Shark board.
  - If second barrel is attached, Act 1 ends immediately.
  - If no Shark: Barrel remains in water as Motion Sensor.

**Brody:**
- **Move:** 1 space on land (adjacent only).
- **Rescue 1 Swimmer:** Remove 1 swimmer from current space.
- **Pick Up 1 Barrel:** From Shop (center space). Can carry only 1 at a time.
- **Drop 1 Barrel:** At any dock.
- **Use Binoculars (once/round):** At any beach. Shark must announce if present. If so, place Shark Mover there.
- **Close a Beach (once/round):** At Mayor’s Office or Amity PD. Close any empty beach.
  - First event that would place swimmers: flip token to "Opening Soon".
  - Next such event: remove token.

**Hooper:**
- **Move:** Up to 2 adjacent water spaces (as 1 action).
- **Rescue 1 Swimmer:** Remove 1 swimmer from current space.
- **Pick Up Barrels:** From dock or water (each source = 1 action).
- **Give Barrels to Quint:** If in same space, give all barrels to Quint.
- **Use Fish Finder (once/round):** Place in current water space.
  - Shark must say:
    - “Here” → place Shark Mover.
    - “Nearby” → in adjacent water space.
    - “Not there nor nearby” → not in space or adjacent.

### Act 2: The Orca

#### 1. Resurface Options
- Reveal top 3 **Resurface Cards**, place face-up on spots A, B, C.

  - **Shake Off Symbol** (fishhook) — removes attached weapons.
- Place **Small Resurface Tokens** in corresponding water zones.

#### 2. Shark Chooses
- Secretly select one of A, B, C using a **Large Resurface Token** (face-down).
- Optionally play **1 Shark Ability Card** face-down under token (discarded after round).

  - If total > Evade Value: Success.
  - Wounds = Total Hits – Evade Value.
  - Apply card effects.
- **Attachable Weapon:**
  - Automatically attaches (no roll).
  - Effect active until shaken off.

#### 6. Shark Attacks
Choose **one** target:

**Attack the Boat:**
- Must be adjacent to boat space.
- Roll dice shown on Resurface Card.
- **Undamaged Tile:** Smaller number = damage (flip tile), larger = destroy (remove).
- **Damaged Tile:** Single number = destroy.
- If boat damaged/destroyed, all crew on it fall into water space.

**Attack a Crew Member:**
- Must be in water and in same or adjacent water space.
- Roll dice shown. Each hit = 1 wound.

**Bonus Attacks:**
- After main attack, roll 1 die per crew member in same or adjacent water space.
- Each hit = 1 wound.

**Elimination:**
- If a Crew Member’s Wound Track reaches X, remove meeple and discard all Gear Cards.

## 6. Scoring & End Game

### End of Act 1
Act 1 ends when:
- Shark eats 9 swimmers (immediate end), OR
- Crew attaches 2nd barrel to Shark (immediate end).

**Proceed to Act 2.** The number of swimmers eaten determines card distribution:
- Shark gets that many **Shark Ability Cards**.
- Crew (as a group) gets that many **Crew Gear Cards** (divided among players).

### End of Game
Game ends when:
1. **Shark Wins:** All 3 Crew eliminated OR all 8 Boat Tiles destroyed.
2. **Crew Wins:** Shark’s Wound Track reaches X.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can multiple barrels float in one space?** Yes. No limit.
- **Does Out of Sight affect Barrel launch?** No. Shark must still announce if hit.
- **Does Motion Sensor trigger if Shark passes over dock/boat?** No. Only floating barrels in water trigger.
- **Can Crew skip attacking even if targeted correctly?** Yes.
- **Are Melee Weapons discarded after use?** Only if card says so. Default is no.
- **Can Firearm target any water space regardless of position?** Yes.
- **Can two Resurface Cards show same zone?** Yes. Shark can still choose based on dice/evade.
