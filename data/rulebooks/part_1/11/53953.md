### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Party Deck:** Each player's personal deck. New cards go to discard pile; reshuffle discard when deck is empty.
- **Gold Value:** Used to purchase cards. Calculated from revealed cards during Village visit.
- **Leveling Up Heroes:**
  - Destroy Level 1 or 2 Hero in hand.
  - Pay XP cost shown on card.
  - Take next-level Hero from matching stack; place on discard pile.
  - Cannot level up same Hero type twice per turn.
  - Militia can level up to any Level 1 Hero for 3 XP.
- **Combat:**
  - **Attack Value:** Sum of Attack and Magic Attack bonuses.
  - **Light Penalties:** Based on Monster rank:
    - Rank 1: -2 Attack (needs 1 Light)
    - Rank 2: -4 Attack (needs 2 Light)
    - Rank 3: -6 Attack (needs 3 Light)
  - Light from cards (e.g., Torch, Flaming Sword) reduces penalty (max reduction = penalty).
  - Unequipped Weapons provide no benefit.
  - Disease cards in hand: -1 to Attack or Magic Attack.
- **Trophies:** Monster cards with ★ symbol. When revealed in hand, grant ongoing bonuses (e.g., Light, Attack).
- **Breach Effects:** Trigger once when Monster reaches Rank 1 (e.g., Tyxr the Old forces all players to discard 2 cards).
- **Spoils:** After defeating Monster, purchase one card of specified type using gold from revealed cards (e.g., Gray Ooze allows purchase of Food card).
- **Destroying Cards:** Permanently remove from game (except Disease and XP, which return to supply).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End:** Triggered when Thunderstone reaches Rank 1.
  - If you defeated a Monster in Rank 1 and Thunderstone moves there, you claim it.
  - Otherwise, Thunderstone is not claimed.
- **Scoring:**
  - Combine all cards: deck, hand, discard pile, any controlled cards.
  - Total VP from all cards (number in lower right corner).
- **Winning:**
  - Highest VP wins.
  - Tie: Player with Thunderstone wins.
  - Tie and no Thunderstone: Shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I attack a Monster I can't defeat?** Yes. You must attack a Monster if you choose "Enter the Dungeon."
- **Can I use a Weapon without a Hero?** No. Weapons must be equipped to a Hero to provide benefit.
- **What happens to cards destroyed by Battle Effects?** They remain in play until end of battle, then are destroyed.
- **Can I use a Trophy effect from a Monster in my hand against another Monster?** Yes. Trophies are active when revealed in hand.
- **Do I draw cards before or after resolving Breach?** Breach is resolved during battle resolution, before discarding hand.
- **Can I level up a Hero after buying it?** Yes, during same Village visit, after purchase.
- **What if next-level Hero is unavailable?** Cannot level up.
- **Can I use Banish to rearrange hall and end game without claiming Thunderstone?** Yes. Banish lets you refill hall; if Thunderstone moves to Rank 1, game ends immediately without being claimed.
