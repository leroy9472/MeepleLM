## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
The players collaboratively build the medieval city of Carcassonne, expanding its streets, markets, residential areas, and walls. Through strategic tile placement and follower deployment, players earn points during and at the end of the game. The player with the highest score wins.

2. **Components**  
- 75 city tiles (featuring street segments, residential areas, markets, and buildings)  
- 70 wall pieces  
- 2 short walls (used only when regular walls don’t fit next to the city gate)  
- 12 towers (wooden pieces)  
- 1 city gate  
- 32 followers (8 per player in 4 colors)  
- 1 scoring track  
- 2 storage bags (for tiles and wooden pieces)

Tile types include:  
- Markets: Fish, Grain, Livestock (brown background)  
- 32 public buildings (gray oval symbol)  
- 7 historic buildings (labeled: Petit Puits, Grand Puits, Tour Carrée, L’Épicerie, Saint Sernin, Saint Nazaire, Château Comtal)  
- Residential areas

3. **Setup**  
- Each player takes 8 followers in their color, places one on space 0 of the scoring track, and keeps the remaining 7 in their supply.  
- The 12 towers are divided equally among players.  
- Shuffle the 75 tiles and divide them into 3 face-down stacks:  
  - Stack 1: 30 tiles  
  - Stack 2: 25 tiles  
  - Stack 3: 20 tiles  
- Place Stack 1 within reach; set aside Stack 2, Stack 3, all walls, short walls, and the city gate for later use.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Players take turns clockwise. On each turn, a player performs the following actions in order:  
1. **Draw and Place a Tile**: Draw the top tile from the current stack and place it adjacent to at least one existing tile, matching street segments continuously. Tiles may not connect only at corners.  
2. **Place a Follower (Optional)**: May place one follower from their supply on the newly placed tile, on a street (as citizen), market (as seller), or residential area (as steward). Only one follower per turn.  
3. **Score Completed Features**: If the placed tile completes a street or market, score it immediately. Residential areas are never scored mid-game.

5. **Core Mechanics**  

**Tile Placement Rules**  
- Must place tile adjacent to at least one tile by full side (not corner).  
- Street segments must continue existing streets (cannot dead-end into non-wall tile).  
- Markets, residential areas, and other features need not match adjacent tiles.

**Follower Placement Rules**  
- Only one follower per turn.  
- Must be placed on the tile just played.  
- Cannot place on a feature (street, market, residential area) that continues an existing feature already occupied by any follower (even your own).  
- Cannot place on a feature that is completed by the tile if no prior follower was present.  
- Stewards on residential areas are placed lying down; citizens and sellers stand upright.

**Scoring Completed Streets**  
- A street is complete when both ends terminate in a crossing, feature, or wall (or forms a loop).  
- 1–3 tiles: 1 point per tile (total tiles, not segments).  
- 4+ tiles: 2 points per tile (double scoring).  
- The player with the most citizens on the street scores; ties mean all tied players score fully.

**Scoring Completed Markets**  
- A market is complete when fully enclosed (no gaps) and fully bordered.  
- Score = (number of tiles in market) × (number of unique market types present: fish, grain, livestock).  
- Only one instance of each type counts.  
- Player with most sellers scores; ties mean all tied players score fully.

**Returning Followers**  
- After scoring a street or market, all citizens and sellers on that feature return to their owners’ supplies.  
- Returned followers may be reused on future turns.

**Residential Areas**  
- Scored only at game end.  
- Follower (steward) remains on tile until game end.  
- Area defined by being enclosed by streets, markets, or walls.  
- Ownership: player with most stewards in a residential area (or tied for most) owns it.  
- Score: 2 points per adjacent market (complete or incomplete, any type).

**Walls, City Gate, and Tower Phase (Starting with Stack 2)**  
- After last tile from Stack 1 is drawn, players begin drawing from Stack 2. Walls and towers now enter play.  
- After any tile causes scoring (of street or market), the following occurs **after** scoring:  
  - First scoring after Stack 2:  
    - Scoring player takes city gate; each other player takes 1 wall.  
    - Gate placed first by scoring player next to any tile.  
    - Others place walls clockwise adjacent to gate or previous wall.  
  - Subsequent scoring (Stack 2):  
    - Each player takes 1 wall and adds it to the city wall (adjacent to existing wall or gate).  
  - When placing a wall, player may **immediately** place a follower from their supply on it as a **guard**, provided:  
    - There is no guard on the wall directly opposite (across the city).  
  - After all walls are placed, the scoring player may place one of their towers at either end of the city wall.  
    - Score = 1 point per wall between new tower and previous tower or gate.  

**Stack 3 Phase**  
- After last tile from Stack 2 is drawn, players draw from Stack 3.  
- After each scoring:  
  - Each player places **2 walls** (in clockwise order, two full rounds).  
  - After placing each wall, player may place a guard (if opposite wall has no guard).  
  - Scoring player may place a tower at the end of the wall line and score distance as before.  
- If insufficient walls, players take as many as possible in clockwise order, starting with scoring player, up to two rounds.

**Special Rule: 2 Players**  
- During Stack 2 phase: each player builds **2 walls** per scoring.  
- During Stack 3 phase: each player builds **4 walls** per scoring.  
- Players alternate placing 1 wall each until their quota is met.  
- First gate/wall round (Stack 2): scoring player places gate, then opponent places 1 wall, then scoring player places 1 wall, then opponent places 1 wall.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  

**Game End Conditions**  
The game ends immediately when **any** of the following occur:  
- The last wall piece is placed.  
- The last tile is placed (resolve all scoring and wall building).  
- The two ends of the city wall are **5 or fewer wall spaces apart**.

**Final Enclosure**  
- Complete the city wall by placing remaining walls or assuming they are built (even if no walls left).  
- **Score any streets or markets completed by these final walls.**

**Final Scoring**  
- **Remove followers from incomplete streets and markets** – no points awarded.  
- Score the following:

**Residential Areas (Stewards)**  
- For each residential area, determine owner(s): player(s) with most stewards.  
- Each owner scores **2 points per market adjacent** to the residential area.  
- Adjacent markets need not be complete or large.

**Guards on Walls**  
- Each guard scores for the row or column of tiles directly in front of it (toward city center).  
- Score continues until an empty space or edge of city is reached.  
- **Public buildings (gray oval)**: 2 points each  
- **Historic buildings (labeled)**: 3 points each  
- If two guards face each other across an empty space:  
  - Each scores only up to the empty space.  
  - If the space is later filled, both guards score across the full row/column.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can a tile complete multiple features?** Yes. Score all completed streets and markets in any order.  
- **Do walls block tile placement?** Yes. No tiles may be placed outside the city wall or gate.  
- **Can a wall complete a street or market?** Yes. Immediately score the feature, but this does **not** trigger another wall-building phase.  
- **Can a player run out of followers?** Yes. They continue playing tiles but cannot place followers until some are returned via scoring.  
- **Tiebreaker?** Highest total score wins. Rules do not specify tiebreaker beyond that.
