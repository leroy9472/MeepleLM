## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Thunder Alley is a NASCAR-inspired racing board game for 2 to 7 players. Each player controls a team of 3 to 6 racing cars. The objective is to achieve the highest total score by the end of the race, based on finishing positions and lap leadership.

### 2. Components  
- Race track board with sectors and lanes  
- Car counters (per player color, 3–6 per team)  
- Race cards (with movement types and special instructions)  
- Wear markers (Temporary and Permanent: Suspension, Tire, Fuel, Gray Body Damage)  
- Lap Led / Turn Leader tokens  
- Position Markers (for scoring placement)  
- Event Cards  
- Team Bar (used to resolve card effects)  
- First Player Marker  
- Lapped Car Markers  

### 3. Setup  
- Determine number of players and assign teams (3–6 cars each).  
- Shuffle Race Deck; each player draws a card to determine turn order via the Team Bar (leftmost color acts first).  
- Place cars on the starting grid in determined order.  
- Each player draws up to their Hand Size: number of starting cars + 1 (minimum 4, maximum 6).  
- Place Event Deck face down.  
- Place AI decks (if playing solo/AI) next to respective team mats (3 cars per AI team).  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
**Turn Sequence (as printed on board):**  
1. **Deal Cards**: Starting with First Player, each player draws up to their hand size (max 6).  
2. **Perform Action Segments**:  
   - In clockwise order, each player activates one unactivated car per turn until all cars are activated.  
   - For each activation:  
     a. Choose an unactivated car.  
     b. If car has 6+ Wear Markers → retire immediately (take lowest Position Marker).  
     c. Optionally retire car (voluntary).  
     d. Play one Race Card: apply movement type and special instructions.  
     e. Move car according to movement rules (Solo, Draft, Pursuit, Lead).  
     f. Apply wear marker as indicated by card.  
     g. Flip car counter over (indicates activation).  
3. **End of Turn Sequence**:  
   a. **Determine Leader(s)**: Award Turn Leader Marker(s) to car(s) in leading sector.  
   b. **Draw & Resolve Event Card**:  
      - Ignore if any car has finished the race.  
      - Note flag color (Green, Yellow, Red) for pit implications.  
   c. **Perform Pit Stops**:  
      - Starting with First Player, each player may pit none, some, or all cars.  
      - Pitting removes all Temporary Wear Markers.  
      - Cars re-enter track from apron using Solo Movement with reduced speed (smaller number on card).  
      - First move out of apron must be lateral.  
      - If leader changes after pitting, award new leader a Turn Leader Marker.  
   d. **Determine First Player**: Player controlling current leader receives First Player Marker.  
   e. **Remove Lapped Cars**: Any car with Lapped Car Marker not ahead of leader is retired; take lowest available Position Marker.  
   f. **Discard**: Players may discard any unwanted Race Cards.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Movement Types  
- **Solo Movement**: Car moves independently. May use any path (forward/lateral), spend all MPs unless bump attempt fails.  
- **Draft Movement**: Links cars both in front and behind when moving forward. Activated car must link at start. Lateral movement allowed before linking. Once linked, no lateral movement.  
- **Pursuit Movement**: Only pushes cars in front. Activated car must move forward to link. After movement, must move one lane outward (if possible).  
- **Lead Movement**: Only pulls cars behind. Activated car must have car(s) behind to form link. Diagonal forward move allowed once per turn (all linked cars follow).  

**General Movement Rules**:  
- Linking is determined **only at start** of movement; no “pick-ups” mid-move.  
- Car behind is linked **only on forward movement**.  
- Activated car must use all Movement Points (MPs), except:  
  - May burn last 1–2 MPs on failed Forward/Lateral Displacement (bumping).  
- Wear Effects:  
  - 3+ Wear Markers: subtract 1 MP per card played.  
  - 6+ Wear Markers: car is retired upon activation.  

#### Special Card Instructions  
- Take precedence over basic rules. Examples:  
  - **CLEAN AIR (Solo)**: If active car is solo and race leader, may move any number of sectors (no MP limit).  
  - **UNDERSTEER (Pursuit)**: After move, must shift one lane outward.  
  - **SLINGSHOT (Lead)**: May make one diagonal forward move during movement; all linked cars follow.  

#### Corners & Lane Changes  
- Entering/exiting corners: Active player chooses lane.  
- Diverging/Converging Lanes (corners):  
  - During Draft/Pursuit, active car may break line and choose path; followers must follow.  
  - AI prioritizes team cars, longest line, then inside lane.  

#### Event Cards  
- Draw one per turn (unless race is ending).  
- Flag determines pit behavior:  
  - **Green Flag / First Red Flag**: Normal pit stops allowed.  
  - **Yellow Flag**: Triggers restart sequence:  
    1. Line up non-pitting cars (darker lanes).  
    2. Conduct pit stops.  
    3. Move non-pitted cars forward.  
    4. Pitted cars return to back of pack.  
    5. Remove all Lapped Car Markers.  
  - **Second Red Flag**: Ends race immediately.  

#### Pit Stops  
- Remove all Temporary Wear Markers.  
- Exit via apron:  
  - First move must be lateral.  
  - Movement uses lower number on Race Card.  
  - Ignore wear penalties when exiting.  
- AI Pit Stops (if applicable):  
  - On last lap, after Event Card, AI may pit based on roll (Green: 1d6 + Temp Wear ≥7; Yellow: ≥4).  
  - AI uses 2 Solo Movement upon return.  

#### Lapped Cars  
- A car is lapped if overtaken by leader (same or behind sector).  
- Can remove Lapped Marker by moving ahead of current leader.  
- At end of turn, lapped cars not ahead of leader are retired.  
- During Yellow Flag restart: all Lapped Markers removed.  

#### AI Rules (Solo Mode)  
- AI uses dedicated decks (4 cards per team).  
- On AI turn: draw card → follow activation rule → move accordingly.  
- AI maximizes forward progress unless instructed to link.  
- On last lap: if any AI car can finish, activate it instead.  
- AI Pit Stops: after Event on last lap, roll to determine if AI pits.  
- AI does not receive wear tokens (in some variants), but may still pit.  

#### Finishing the Race  
- First car to cross finish line on final lap gets 1st Place Position Marker + extra Turn Leader.  
- Once any car finishes:  
  - No more pit stops.  
  - No more Turn Leader awards.  
  - Continue Action Phase in rounds until all cars have activated or finished.  
  - After each full round, remove finished cars and award Position Markers by track order.  
- Final scoring: Award Position Markers to remaining cars by running order.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when all cars have either finished or been retired.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - Position Markers: 1st (10 pts), 2nd (8), 3rd (6), 4th (5), 5th (4), 6th (3), 7th (2), 8th (1), rest (0).  
  - Turn Leader Markers: +1 pt each.  
- **Total Score**: Sum of Position and Turn Leader points for all team cars.  
- **Win Condition**: Player with highest total score wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with highest-placed car wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Multiple Leaders?** All cars in lead sector get Turn Leader Marker.  
- **AI vs Player Wear?** In official AI rules, AI may or may not receive wear (depends on variant).  
- **Displacement (Bumping)**: If move requires displacing another car (e.g., lateral into occupied space), pay MP cost and push car back.  
- **Diagonal Movement**: Only allowed in Lead Movement (SLINGSHOT card), and all linked cars follow.  
- **Team Bar Usage**: Used when Event Card doesn’t specify car. Read left to right; first color with active car applies.  
- **Lapped Car Removal**: Happens **after** pit stops and leader check.  
- **Endgame Timing**: Once any car finishes, skip pit stops and Turn Leader awards in subsequent turns.  
- **Second Red Flag**: Instantly ends race; score based on current positions.
