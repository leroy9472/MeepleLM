### 1. Lore & Objective  
The objective of Yedo with Bots & Solo Mode Variant is to have the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game. The game ends either after Turn 11 or immediately when the "Kill the Shogun" mission is completed.

This variant allows non-human players (Bots) to participate, enabling solo and expanded multiplayer games. All standard Yedo rules apply unless modified by this variant.
