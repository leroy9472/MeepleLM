## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Palm Island*, you lead a fledgling village on a newly discovered island. Through strategic upgrades of your 17-card deck, you develop resources, expand your infrastructure, and earn victory points (VPs). The game lasts 8 rounds. The goal is to maximize your score by upgrading buildings, completing feats, and efficiently managing resources. The player with the highest score wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 or 2 Player Decks (17 cards each)  
- 6 Feat Cards  
- 5 Cooperative Cards (Disasters & Abilities)  
- 14 Competitive Cards (Outposts)  
- 1 Reference Card  
- 1 Round Tracker  
- Stored Resource Dividers (optional)  
- Villager Cards (W) – unique ability cards  

### 3. Setup  
**Solo Setup:**  
- Choose either the red or blue 17-card deck.  
- Identify the start marker (white sun icon) on each card. Flip and rotate all cards so the start marker is in the top-left corner of the front side.  
- Shuffle the deck while preserving orientation.  
- Insert the Round Tracker as the last card.  
- Optional: Note initial deck order before play.  
- You may look at the top 3 cards at any time during the game.  

**Villagers (Optional Solo Mode):**  
- Shuffle Villager deck, draw 3 unique Villagers.  
- Place them in front of the Round Tracker in selection order.  

**Feats (Solo):**  
- Earned Feat cards may be used in future games.  
- Place earned Feats (oriented with unlock marker in top-left) at the back of the deck before starting.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn, choose **one** of the following:  
1. **Take an action** on either of the top two cards.  
2. **Discard** the top card (move it to the back of the deck, unrotated and unflipped).  

If neither top card can be acted upon, **you must discard the top card**. You may never discard the second card directly.

**Available Actions (on active area of card):**  
- **Store (↻):** Pay listed cost, rotate card 90° clockwise, place at back of deck. Resources on active area are now stored.  
- **Rotate (↷):** Pay cost, rotate card 180° (same side), place at back.  
- **Flip (⤾):** Pay cost, flip card front-to-back (no rotation), place at back.  

You may peek at the back of either top two cards when deciding to act.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
**Resource Payment:**  
- Pay costs using stored resource cards.  
- Rotate stored cards **90° counterclockwise** (in place) to spend their resources.  
- Extra resources on a stored card are lost after payment.  
- "/" symbol means **OR** (choose one). Grouped resources mean **AND**.  

**Resource Limit:**  
- Maximum of **4 stored resource cards** may protrude from the deck.  
- To store a 5th, **reset one existing stored card** by rotating it 90° counterclockwise (in place) to deactivate it.  

**Drawing Stored Resources:**  
- If a stored resource card becomes the **top card**, immediately rotate it 90° counterclockwise and move it to the back of the deck (resetting it).  

**Round Progression:**  
- When the **Round Tracker** is the top card, the round ends.  
- Flip or rotate it to the next round number (1–8), then place at back.  
- For rounds 5–8, use the smaller numbers on the reverse side (1/5, 2/6, etc.).  
- You **cannot act** on the Round Tracker when it is the second card.  

**End of Game:**  
- Game ends after completing **Round 8**.  
- All stored resources and card states are preserved for scoring.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Total **Victory Points (★)** from the active area of all cards in your deck.  
- **Tiebreakers (in order):**  
  1. Most upgrades (↑) on cards.  
  2. Most stored resources.  

**Feats (Solo Only):**  
- At game end, check if you meet criteria on any Feat card.  
- If met, **earn** the Feat for future games.  
- Feats like *Axe of Greatness*, *Tooth of the Beast*, etc., require specific building upgrades (e.g., 3 Loggers at level 2).  
- Before game start, some Feats allow pre-game actions, then are set aside.  
- Others are placed at the back of the deck and can be used like buildings (except *Monument of Glory* – one-time use).  

**Villagers (W):**  
- Recruited by paying their cost when in top two positions.  
- Place immediately **behind the Round Tracker** upon recruitment.  
- **Active Villagers (Builder, Elder, etc.):** Effects last the round. Rotate 90° left to mark active.  
  - Builder: Deactivate after use.  
  - Elder: Remains active for game.  
- **Passive Villagers (Merchant, Priest, Chief):** Provide endgame VPs. Remain in deck.  
- **Resource Villagers (Wayfinder, Rider):** Can be stored like resource cards. Reduce final VP total.  
- First recruitment possible at **end of Round 1** (if Villagers are placed before Round Tracker).  

**Cooperative Mode (2 Players):**  
- Each player uses their own shuffled deck.  
- Simultaneous play; pause when **Round Tracker** appears.  
- Choose one **Disaster Card** (e.g., Shipping, Rebuild, Storage).  
- Cost scales with player count (e.g., “per player” costs doubled for 2 players).  
- At end of round, players **combine resources** to pay for disaster progress (rotate or flip card).  
- Must complete disaster by end of Round 8 or **all lose**.  
- Group score = player with **fewest VPs**.  
- Optional: Use one **Cooperative Ability Card** (upgradeable, shared ability).  

**Competitive Modes:**  
- **Casual Competitive:**  
  - One player sets deck order; others match.  
  - Draw 3 unique Outposts (Forest, Sea, Mountain).  
  - At end of each round, players may buy an Outpost if they meet criteria.  
  - If multiple players qualify, **no one gets it**.  
  - Outposts add to final score.  
- **Speed Competitive:**  
  - Same setup.  
  - Outposts placed face-up in central area (4 available, decreasing).  
  - First player to reach Round Tracker buys first, then others in order.  
  - Rotate purchased Outpost 180° and place **just after Round Tracker**.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
