## Conflict of Heroes: Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Conflict of Heroes is a tactical-level World War II board game simulating squad- and vehicle-based combat on the Eastern Front. Players alternate activations to maneuver units, engage in firefights, and achieve scenario-specific objectives. Victory is determined by controlling key terrain, destroying enemy units, or fulfilling mission orders.

The core gameplay emphasizes realism, command decision-making, and historical accuracy through unit differentiation, terrain effects, and dynamic action point economy.

### 2. Components  
- **Unit Counters**: Represent infantry squads, vehicles, guns, engineers, mortars, and trucks. Each has defined movement, firepower (FP), defense ratings (Front/Flank DR), and action costs.  
- **Hit Counters**: Used to track combat damage (e.g., Pinned, Suppressed, Berserk, Immobilized). Backs are color-coded: black = full loss, blue/red = color-specific loss.  
- **Action Cards**: Introduce fog-of-war, special abilities, and command options (e.g., Dual Actions, Extra Grenades, Bogged Down).  
- **Command Action Point (CAP) Track**: Tracks available command points for enhanced actions.  
- **Map Boards**: Hex-grid terrain including woods, buildings, hills, bunkers, barbed wire, and roads.  
- **Land Mine Counters**, **Hasty Defense Counters**, **Spotting Markers**, and **Fortification Markers**.  
- **Dice (d6)**: Used for combat resolution, rallying, and random events.

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose a Firefight (scenario) and place map boards as specified.  
2. Set starting CAP levels per scenario or standard rules (based on force size and leadership).  
3. Place units according to setup instructions or diagram (if discrepancy, diagram takes precedence).  
4. Shuffle Action Card deck and deal starting hand (number varies by scenario).  
5. Place hit counters, land mines (if applicable), and spotting markers off-board as needed.  
6. Hidden units are placed face-down within 1 hex of their original position (new hiding rule).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game proceeds in **Rounds** (formerly "Turns"):

1. **Initiative**: Determine active player (varies by scenario; may alternate).  
2. **Activation Phase**:  
   - Active player activates one or more **Fresh** units.  
   - May share activation using a **7AP pool** (9.0 Shared Activations).  
   - Units may take individual or **Group Actions** (move, fire, rally, etc.).  
   - Opponent may **React** after each action (unless group action).  
3. **Opportunity Actions**:  
   - Spent or fresh units may take opportunity moves or fire if triggered.  
   - Group opportunity actions allowed (all participants marked **Spent**).  
4. **Command Actions**:  
   - Use **CAPs** to perform actions (e.g., move, fire, rally) with **Spent**, **Fresh**, or activated units.  
   - No AP cost; instead, CAPs are deducted.  
5. **Passing**:  
   - When both players pass consecutively (or all but one pass in 3–4 player games), the **Round ends**.  
   - A player may **Stall** by spending 1AP or 1CAP to delay passing.  
6. **End of Round**:  
   - Reset spent units to **Fresh**.  
   - Draw Action Cards if required.  
   - Check victory conditions.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action Points (AP) & Command Action Points (CAP)  
- Each unit has 7AP per activation.  
- **CAPs** are abstract leadership points used to perform actions outside activation (e.g., rally, move, fire).  
- CAP level decreases when a unit is destroyed and placed on the CAP track at or below current level.  

#### Movement  
- **Foot Units**: Pay AP based on terrain (e.g., clear = 1AP, woods = 2AP).  
- **Tracked Vehicles**: Gain bonus movement in corn/wheat fields. Cannot cross small balkas.  
- **Wheeled Vehicles**:  
  - No bonus movement except on roads.  
  - +1AP when passing other vehicles **on roads only**.  
  - Cannot enter barbed wire or cross walls.  
- **Hidden Movement**:  
  - +3AP in covering terrain, +6AP in open terrain.  
- **Group Movement**:  
  - Units adjacent or in continuous line may group move.  
  - Pay movement cost of slowest unit + terrain cost.  
  - Only one reaction allowed by enemy after full group completes move.  

#### Line of Sight (LOS)  
- Determined from center of hex to center of hex.  
- **Plateau Effect**: Units on high ground can see further; blind spots exist behind slopes.  
- **Enhanced LOS**: Units in woods/buildings may be visible only at close range or direct adjacency.  
- **Walls**: Block LOS and provide +1DM; count as covering terrain for hidden units if LOS crosses wall.  

#### Combat  
- **Attack Values**:  
  - Units have **Blue FP** and **Red FP**.  
  - Always attack matching color DR (blue FP vs. blue DR, red FP vs. red DR).  
  - No splitting FP; no cross-color attacks.  
- **Firegroups (Group Firing)**:  
  - One **Fire Leader** (pays firing cost).  
  - Supporting units must:  
    - Be adjacent or in same hex.  
    - Have LOS, range, and target in arc of fire.  
    - Not have FP-reducing hit markers.  
    - Be within **standard range** (not long range) of target.  
  - Each supporter adds +1FP to fire leader.  
- **Vehicle Hits**:  
  - Losing red or blue FP means unit cannot attack matching DR type.  
  - **Gun Damage** counter disables one color FP.  

#### Hidden Units  
- May be hit by **any fire type** (not just red FP).  
- When multiple hidden units in hex:  
  - **Mortar/artillery fire** affects only unit with **lowest flank DR** (even if hit is scored).  
- **Hiding**:  
  - Unit may hide in a hex **one hex away** from original position (reduced from two).  
- **Revealing**: Occurs when moving, firing, or forced by card/effect.

#### Special Rules  
- **Bunkers**: All foot units may enter and fire from bunkers.  
- **Land Mines**:  
  - Cleared only by: mortar/artillery fire, CC attack (foot unit), or engineer.  
  - **Engineers** reveal but do **not trigger** mines.  
  - In AtB: Mines have blue FP 8; attack flank DR using normal rules.  
- **Loading/Transporting**:  
  - Trucks carry **one unit only** (exception: German truck may carry LMG + Rifle unit in AtB).  
  - APCs: Combined LMG units only.  
- **Close Combat (CC)**:  
  - **+4FP**: Rifles, SMGs, Pioneers, Tanks, Armored Cars, APCs.  
  - **–2FP**: MGs, Guns, Mortars, Wagons, Trucks.  
  - Use **red FP** against units with red DR.  
  - All other SoS CC rules apply.  
- **Walls**:  
  - +1DM against all fire.  
  - +1AP to cross (foot and tracked).  
  - Wheeled units cannot cross.  
- **Cautious Movement (Optional)**:  
  - Combined rule: foot unit entering DM bonus terrain may use cautious movement.  
  - No penalty if entering vehicle cover or DM-protected hex.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Victory determined per **Firefight** (scenario). Common objectives:  
- Control victory hexes or markers.  
- Destroy specific units.  
- Eliminate enemy force.  
- Exit units off map edge.  

End of game typically occurs after a set number of rounds or when objective is achieved. Players compare victory points or mission success.

#### CAP Adjustment on Unit Destruction  
- When unit is destroyed, place it on CAP track starting from max CAP, moving down.  
- If placed at or below current CAP level, reduce CAP by 1.

#### Rallying  
- Draw hit counter face-down.  
- **Hiding stats is mandatory** (no optional concealment).  
- Rally roll: d6 vs. required number (varies by counter):  
  - Pinned, Suppressed, Unnerved: 7+  
  - Cowering, Panicked, Berserk: 8+  
  - Stunned: 7+  
  - Vehicle Panicked: 9+, Stunned: 10+  
- Group Rally: 5AP/CAP for adjacent units; simultaneous; no mutual bonus.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a truck group move with infantry into a building?**  
  No. Movement restrictions still apply during group movement.  
- **Do supporting units in firegroup need to pay firing cost?**  
  No. Only fire leader pays AP/CAP.  
- **Can a spent unit join a group command action?**  
  Yes. Spent, fresh, or activated units can group using CAPs.  
- **Can engineers clear mines without triggering them?**  
  Yes. They reveal and clear without triggering attack.  
- **Can a unit with only red FP attack a blue DR?**  
  In AtB: Yes. Add modifiers, halve total FP, then attack.  
- **Can airplanes group with other units?**  
  No. Airplane units cannot group with any units.  
- **Can you use the same weapon card twice?**  
  No. Unless firefight states otherwise, each weapon card may be used once per game.  
- **Do hit counters affect weapon card use?**  
  Yes. Effects (e.g., FP loss, AP cost) apply when using weapon cards.  
- **Can a pinned unit be transported?**  
  Yes. Pinned unit cannot move under own power but may be loaded/transported.
