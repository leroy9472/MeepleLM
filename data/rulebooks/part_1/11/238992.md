   - Each player chooses one of each type to keep; discard the rest.  
   - Place chosen Origin (face-up) on the left, Motivation (face-up) in the middle, and Destiny (face-down) on the right of the player board.  

2. **Starting Hand & Tokens**:  
   - Each player receives 1 Hero card (hidden) and 3 Experience tokens.  
   - Place Hero marker on the third space of the Corruption track (neutral).  

3. **Story Decks**:  
   - Shuffle Act I, II, and III decks separately.  
   - Lay out 4 face-down cards per Act (5 if 4 players).  
   - Flip only the Act I cards face-up.  

4. **Other Decks**:  
   - Shuffle Hero and Antihero decks; place near the story area.  
   - Place runes and Experience tokens within reach.  

5. **First Player**:  
   - The player who most recently read a novel goes first.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Players take turns clockwise.  
- On a turn, a player may:  
  1. Gain a Trait or Attempt a Challenge (one per turn).  
  2. Journey: Spend 1 XT to replace a face-up story card.  
  3. Play Hero/Antihero cards or use card effects.  
- After action(s), replace any claimed or discarded story card from the same Act deck.  
- Play ends when one player tucks their third card under their Destiny. All other players get one final turn.  

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Traits
- Identified by one white banner and a white text box.  
- Acquired by meeting the requirement listed on the card.  
- Tucked under current storyline card (Origin → Motivation → Destiny).  

#### Challenges
- Identified by two white banners and a difficulty number on the left.  
- Player declares a path (top or bottom); +1 difficulty if path has +1 icon.  
- **Difficulty**: Must meet or exceed the number shown.  

#### Rune Casting
- **Core Runes**: Always cast all 3.  
- **Ability Runes**:  
  - 1 basic rune per matching attribute icon in your story.  
  - Special rune (3 dots) available only when you have 3+ icons of that attribute.  
  - Max 3 runes per attribute (1 special + 2 basic).  
- **Dark Runes**:  
  - Spend 1 XT per Dark Rune (max 3 per attempt).  
  - Moon side: +2 successes but move Corruption marker down 1.  
  - Cannot use if at max Corruption (CCCC).  
- **Success**: Total ≥ difficulty → succeed, tuck card.  
- **Failure**: Discard card, gain 1 XT.  

#### Hero/Antihero Cards
- Draw when:  
  - Rune result shows △ (Hero), ▽ (Antihero), or both (choose).  
  - Story card has Hero/Antihero icon.  
- Playable anytime unless restricted by card text or Corruption track.  
- Played cards go face-up beside tableau; worth 1 point each at endgame.  

#### Ending an Act
- When a player has 3 cards under a storyline card (Origin, Motivation, Destiny), they end that Act.  
- At the start of their next turn, if they are the first to complete an Act, reveal all face-down cards of the next Act.  
- All players may take cards from any revealed Act, but must complete 3 cards under current storyline card before progressing.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Re-attempting Challenges**:  
  - Do not repurchase Dark runes.  
  - Can add new Dark runes or card effects before second cast.  
  - Only apply Corruption from second attempt.  
- **Hero/Antihero Cards**:  
  - Not part of "Story" for Destiny card scoring.  
  - Can be played during a challenge after runes are cast if timing allows.  
- **Runes**: Shared pool; no ownership.  
- **Multiple Paths**: Can take Act II cards while still on Act I, but tuck under Origin.  
- **Deck Depletion**: Reshuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
- **No Valid Options**: May replace one face-up card without paying Journey cost.
