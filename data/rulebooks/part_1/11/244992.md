## The Mind — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
All players form a single team attempting to play their cards in ascending order across a series of levels. The goal is to complete all levels without losing all lives. Success requires silent coordination and shared intuition. The team wins collectively by completing the required number of levels based on player count.

2. Components  
- 100 number cards (numbered 1–100)  
- 12 level cards (numbered 1–12)  
- 5 life cards  
- 3 throwing star (shuriken) cards  

3. Setup  
- Determine player count and set up accordingly:  
  - 2 players: Levels 1–12, 2 lives, 1 throwing star  
  - 3 players: Levels 1–10, 3 lives, 1 throwing star  
  - 4 players: Levels 1–8, 4 lives, 1 throwing star  
- Place level cards in a face-up stack with level 1 on top.  
- Set lives and throwing star face-up; unused lives and stars form a supply.  
- Shuffle the 100 number cards.  
- For level 1, deal 1 card to each player. Players hold cards secretly.  
- Place remaining number cards face-down in a draw pile.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each level proceeds as follows:  
1. **Dealing**: At level N, each player receives N cards (reshuffle full deck each level).  
2. **Concentration Phase**: All players place one hand palm-down on the table. When ready, all remove hands to begin play.  
3. **Playing Cards**:  
   - Players may play cards at any time, in no fixed order.  
   - Each player must always play their lowest-value card when they play.  
   - Cards are placed one at a time into a single face-up pile in the center.  
   - No verbal or prearranged nonverbal communication is allowed.  
4. **Refocusing**: At any time, a player may call “stop.” All players return hands to the table, refocus, then remove hands to resume.  
5. **Errors**:  
   - If a player plays a card higher than another player’s lowest card, play stops immediately.  
   - The team loses 1 life (remove a life card).  
   - All players holding cards lower than the incorrectly played card must discard them.  
   - Team refocuses and continues the same level.  
6. **Throwing Star (Shuriken) Use**:  
   - Any player may raise a hand to suggest using a throwing star.  
   - If all players raise their hands, the star is used.  
   - Each player discards their lowest card.  
   - One throwing star is returned to the supply.  
   - Team refocuses and continues.  
7. **Level Completion**:  
   - If all players play all their cards in correct ascending order, the level is complete.  
   - The completed level card is removed and placed in the box.  
   - Proceed to next level: reshuffle all 100 cards, deal N+1 cards per player.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Silent Play**: No communication of card values, hints, or signals.  
- **Lowest Card Rule**: A player must play their lowest card when they decide to play.  
- **Error Detection**: Any player holding a lower card than the one just played can stop the game.  
- **Throwing Star**: A strategic tool to discard low cards when progress is stalled.  
- **Refocusing**: Allows team to reset timing and mental synchronization.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Rewards**: Completing specific levels grants bonuses:  
  - Level 2: +1 throwing star  
  - Level 3: +1 life  
  - Level 5: +1 throwing star  
  - Level 6: +1 life  
  - Level 8: +1 throwing star  
  - Level 9: +1 life

  - 4 players: Complete levels 1–8  
- **Loss Condition**: Lose all lives.  
- **Blind Mode (Optional Challenge)**:  
  - After completing all required levels, the team may continue in blind mode.  
  - Cards are played face-down.  
  - At end of level, stack is revealed.  
  - Any incorrect sequence costs 1 life.  
  - Game continues under same rules.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a player play multiple cards in a row?**  
  Yes, if they hold consecutive low cards (e.g., 23 and 24), they may play them one after the other.  
- **What happens if two players play simultaneously?**  
  The card with the lower value takes precedence. If higher card is played first, it triggers an error.  
- **Can throwing stars be used after losing all lives?**  
  No — if the last life is lost, the game ends immediately.  
- **Are unused throwing stars carried over?**  
  Yes — up to a maximum of 3.  
- **Can you use a throwing star even if it’s not needed?**  
  Yes, as long as at least one is available and all players agree.
