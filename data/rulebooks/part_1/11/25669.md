## Qwirkle — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Qwirkle is an abstract tile-placement game often described as “Scrabble for people who can't spell.” Players score points by placing tiles to form lines based on matching either color or shape—but not both—without duplicates. The objective is to score as many points as possible by creating and extending lines, completing “Qwirkles” (lines of six unique tiles sharing one attribute), and potentially ending the game first when the tile bag is empty.

2. Components  
- 108 wooden tiles: 3 tiles each of 6 colors and 6 shapes  
  - Colors: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple  
  - Shapes: Circle, 4-Pointed Star, Diamond, Square, 8-Pointed Star, Cloverleaf  
- 1 draw bag (optional, for tile storage and mixing)  
- Optional: scoring sheet, pen, cardboard tiles (for colorblind version)  

Note: Black-and-white or colorblind-friendly versions replace colors with letters (A–F) and shapes with numbers (1–6).

3. Setup  
- Place all tiles face-down in a draw bag or pile.  
- Each player draws 6 tiles to form their hand (kept secret).  
- Players reveal the largest group of tiles in their hand that match by a single attribute (color or shape, no duplicates).  
- The player with the largest such group starts the game by playing those tiles.  
  - In case of a tie, the oldest player among those tied begins.  
- Play proceeds clockwise.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, they must perform **one** of the following actions:

a) Play Tiles:  
- Place one or more tiles in a single line (row or column) on the grid.  
- All played tiles must lie in the same row or column and share exactly one attribute: either all the same color or all the same shape (but not both).  
- No duplicate tiles (same color + same shape) are allowed in any line.  
- Tiles may be placed adjacent to existing tiles, but every line formed or extended must follow the matching rule.  
- A single tile may score points for both a row and a column if it completes or extends both.  
- After playing, draw replacement tiles from the bag to restore a hand of 6 tiles.

b) Trade In Tiles:  
- If unable or unwilling to play, a player may trade any number of tiles from their hand.  
- Set aside chosen tiles, draw an equal number from the bag, then return the traded tiles to the bag.  
- This action is mandatory if a player cannot legally play and tiles remain in the bag.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Lines: A valid line consists of 2 or more tiles in a straight row or column where all tiles share one attribute (color or shape), with no duplicate tiles.  
- Scoring:  
  - Score 1 point per tile in each line extended or created.  
  - If a move extends multiple lines (e.g., a tile completes both a row and a column), score all affected lines.  
  - Completing a line of exactly six tiles (all six shapes of one color, or all six colors of one shape) is a “Qwirkle” and earns 6 bonus points (total: 12 points — 6 for tiles, 6 bonus).  
- Tile Management:  
  - Always draw back to 6 tiles after playing, if possible.  
  - If the bag is empty, no drawing occurs.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game End Conditions:  
  - The game ends when the draw pile is exhausted and one player plays their final tile.  
  - That player scores 6 bonus points for ending the game.  
- Final Scoring:  
  - All players tally their accumulated points during play.  
  - The player who empties their hand when the bag is empty scores +6 bonus.  
  - No penalties for remaining tiles.  
- Winner: The player with the highest total score wins.

Bonus Point Reminder:  
- Qwirkle (completing a 6-tile line): +6 bonus (total 12 pts for the play)  
- First player to empty hand when bag is empty: +6 bonus

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I play tiles that extend both a row and a column?  
  Yes. If a tile contributes to two valid lines, score both. Each line must independently satisfy the color/shape rule.

- Can a line have more than six tiles?  
  No. A line may never exceed six tiles because there are only six unique shapes and six unique colors. A line must stop at six.

- Can I play a tile that creates a valid line in one direction but invalid in another?  
  No. All lines (row and column) that include newly placed tiles must be valid.

- What if I can’t play any tiles?  
  If tiles remain in the bag, you must trade at least one tile. If the bag is empty and you cannot play, you may pass (no action; no draw).

- Can two tiles of the same color and shape be on the board?  
  No. Each tile is unique. There is only one tile for each color-shape combination.

- Does the starting line have to be six tiles long?  
  No. The starting player plays the largest matching set they have, which could be 2–6 tiles.
