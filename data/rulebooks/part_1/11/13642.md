## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Sous Louis XIV*, players take on the role of courtiers vying for influence in the court of the Sun King. Over four rounds, players use influence cards and markers to gain favor with 12 key figures (Personages) at court, earn Mission chips, fulfill secret Missions, and accumulate Victory Points. The goal is to amass the most Victory Points by the end of the fourth round through completed Missions, collected shields, and endgame bonuses. In case of a tie, the player with the most influence markers in their private supply wins.

- Place the Louis XIV figure beside the gold coins.
- Place components near the board:
  - **Money cards**: shuffle all 8, return 4 to box, place remaining 4 face down beside gold coins.
  - **Intrigue cards**: shuffle, place face down between Tiles 11 and 12.
  - **Influence cards**: shuffle, place face down below Tile 11 (Jules Mazarin).
  - **Mission cards**: sort into 3 face-down decks by color (pale, medium, dark blue), place at bottom of play area.
  - **Mission chips**: place near relevant tiles:
    - Crowns: between Tiles 5–6 and 9–10
    - Letters: between Tiles 8–9
    - Others: next to their matching Personage (Tiles 1–4, 5, 9)
  - **Shields**: shuffle, place face down above play area.

#### Player Setup
Each player receives:

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **4 rounds**, each with **4 phases**:

#### Phase 1: Resupply
1. **Money**: Reveal top Money card. Each player takes indicated amount. Place Louis XIV figure on the tile shown (1–4).
2. **Missions (not in Round 1)**: Starting with the starting player, players resolve effects of any face-up Mission cards that trigger during this phase (e.g., gain gold, markers, cards).
3. **Influence Cards**: Each player draws 5 Influence cards.

#### Phase 2: Influence  
Players take turns clockwise, starting with the starting player. On a turn:
- Play **1 Influence card** face up.
- Use it to either:
  - **Place Influence markers**:  
    - **Personage card (portrait)**: Place up to 3 markers from private supply on matching tile.  
      - May move markers diagonally to adjacent tiles, up to two jumps.  
      - Must leave **at least one marker behind** on each tile moved from.  
    - **Joker card (tapestry)**: Place up to 2 markers on any tile(s), with optional single diagonal move (again, leave at least one behind if moving).
  - **Retrieve markers**:  
    - **Personage card**: Take up to 3 of your markers from common supply to private supply.  
    - **Joker card**: Take up to 2 of your markers from common supply to private supply.

> A player may do **only one** action per card: place OR retrieve.

Continue until each player has **1 card left**. The last card is **discarded with no effect**.  
After all cards are played, **shuffle all Influence cards** and place face down below Tile 11.

#### Phase 3: Evaluation  
Evaluate tiles in numerical order (1 to 12). Before each tile is evaluated:
- A player may play **1 Intrigue card** (if they hold the one matching the tile).
  - They may place:
    - 1 marker from **common supply**, OR
    - Up to 2 markers from **private supply**.
  - Then discard the Intrigue card face down under the pile.

Each tile has one of three conditions:

##### A. Money (💰)
- **Majority holder**: Gets reward for free; places all their markers on this tile into **common supply**.
- **Others with markers**: May **pay** the indicated gold to buy the reward; keep markers in **private supply**.
- **Tie for majority**: No one gets free reward; all may buy. All markers returned to **private supply**.

##### B. First Place ("1.")
- **Only the majority holder** gets the reward; places markers in **common supply**.
- **Tied majority**: No one gets reward. All take markers back to **private supply**.

##### C. Influence Markers (⬜)
- All players with **at least the required number** of markers get the reward.
- Markers go back to **private supply**.
- Majority is irrelevant.

**Exception: Louis XIV is on the tile (Tiles 1–4 only)**
- **Most markers**: Gets tile’s reward + **1 Crown chip**; markers to **common supply**.
- **Second most**: Gets tile’s reward; markers to **private supply**.
- **Tie for first**: All tied get only the tile’s reward (no Crown); markers to **common supply**.
- **Others**: As per normal (nothing for "First Place", may buy for "Money").

**Tile Flipping**
After evaluation:
- **Money or First Place**: Flip tile if **one player had clear majority**.
- **Influence Markers**: Flip tile if **at least one player received the reward**.
- **Do not flip in Round 4** (but still resolve marker placement).

#### Phase 4: Missions  
Starting with the starting player, each player may:
- Reveal a Mission card by returning **both required chips** to supply.
  - **?** = any chip.
  - **Crown** = can substitute for any chip (2 crowns can fulfill any card).
- Immediately draw a **new Mission card** from any of the 3 decks.
- May continue revealing cards if able (using new chips/cards).
- Turn ends when player cannot or chooses not to fulfill another card.

**Chip Limit**:  
- After this phase, each player may keep **only 1 Mission chip**.
- Discard excess chips: gain **1 face-down shield per chip discarded**.

After all players finish, pass the **starting player marker** clockwise. Begin next round.

> In **3-player game**: Starting player in **Round 4** receives top Intrigue card during Resupply Phase.

A: No. You must choose **one action**: place OR retrieve.

**Q: What happens if I have no markers in common supply for a card effect?**  
A: The effect fails. No substitution unless rule allows (e.g., private supply may be used for placement if common is empty).

A: No. Intrigue cards are played **before** evaluation, **before** Louis XIV effects.

**Q: Do I have to use a Mission card effect?**  
A: No. Revealed cards may be used **optionally** each phase.

**Q: What if the Influence or Intrigue deck runs out?**  
A: Shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

**Q: Can I use a Mission card immediately after drawing it in the same Missions phase?**  
A: Yes, as long as you have the chips.

**Q: In 2-player game, how does dummy player work?**  
A: At start of Influence phase:
- Place 2 markers on Louis XIV tile.
- Reveal top 3 Influence cards; for each Personage card, place 2 markers on that tile (skip Jokers). Discard revealed cards.

Dummy never scores.
