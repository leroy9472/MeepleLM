4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 13 rounds. Each round, players take turns in clockwise order. On your turn, follow these steps:

Step 1: Plan  
- Reset (optional): If your 3 locked dice show equal values, reset them to 1, 2, 3.  
- Rounds 1–10: Choose a night die from your main reserve. Use it to bump a locked die into your action pool. The bumped die’s slot determines your bonus:  
  - Slot #1 (Crafting): Craft a basic good based on the *new* die’s value (use crafting chart).  
  - Slot #2 (Lantern): Gain 1 lantern OR move 1 illuminated die from special reserve to action pool.  
  - Slot #3 (Coins/Wheel): Gain 2 coins OR rotate market wheel 1 space clockwise.  
- Rounds 11–13: No main reserve dice. Choose one locked die and move it to action pool. Take its bonus:  
  - Slot #1: Gain 1 basic good of your choice (no chart).  
  - Slot #2 and #3: Same as before.

Step 2: Move  
- Choose 1 die from your action pool (night or illuminated). Move your wagon pawn clockwise that many spaces on the Ringway.  
- You may discard 1 horseshoe to move +1 or -1 space (only once per turn).

Step 3: Act  
- Your wagon is adjacent to two districts. You may activate:  
  - 1 district: if only 1 die in action pool.  
  - 2 districts and the building between them: if both a night die and illuminated die are in action pool.  
- Place die(s) from action pool onto action spaces to activate. Die values do not matter.  
- Resolve actions in any order. Fully resolve each before next.

Step 4: Rest  
- Retrieve used night die to spent pile. Discard used illuminated die to supply.  
- End of rounds 4, 7, 9, 10:  
  - Remove 1 night die from spent pile (out of game).  
  - Reroll remaining spent night dice and return to main reserve.  
  - (Round 10: no dice to reroll after removal.)  
- Reroll any set-aside market dice and return to matching wheel sections (max 2 per section).  
- Slide companion cards toward deck; refill row to 3 face-up cards. If rightmost card lacks travel die, add one.  
- Refill empty hero card and deed card slots from respective decks.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Locked Dice**: 3 slots with fixed actions. Bumping dice triggers bonuses. Reset if all three match.  
- **Action Pool**: Holds 1 or 2 dice (night or illuminated). Used for movement and activation.  
- **District Activation**:  
  - Great Bazaar: Buy goods (cost = sum of section values; second good of same type free), optionally rotate wheel or change 1 market die.  
  - Queen’s Commissions: Take top commission from any stack.  
  - Dark Market: Spend 1+ coins to move marker 1–4 spaces clockwise; gain shown reward (2 goods or 1 commission/deed).  
  - Ringway Inn: Sell 1–3 goods to a hero (gain coins based on market value; +$1 and 1 blazing quartz per upgraded good); recruit hero (gain bonus: lantern, horseshoe, or storage).  
  - Yurg’s Excursions:  
    - Ruins of Yin: Move marker 1 + 1 per hero on wagon (max 4); gain shown upgraded good. Optionally spend 1 lantern to roll ruins die for bonus.  
    - Travel: Lead caravan to outlying town. Choose companion, route (Dark Road or Shortcut, costing 3 lanterns), and destination. Others may join. Resolve event: reveal card, roll travel dice (1 per traveler +1 if companion allows), players choose dice in order (leader first on Dark Road; left of leader first on Shortcut). Each gains benefit or pays cost. Travelers deliver commissions/heroes. Leader gains 1 (Dark Road) or 2 (Shortcut) good fortunes (choose from: illuminated die, deed, 3 coins (first time: 5), or wagon upgrade).  
- **Wagon Upgrades**: Max 1 per player. Effects:  
  - Craft upgraded good in slot #1  
  - Gain lantern + move illuminated die in slot #2  
  - Gain 3 coins or 1 prestige in slot #3  
  - Extra storage (2x2)  
  - Free ruins die roll  
  - Second steed  
- **Companions**: Trigger abilities by paying cost (usually blazing quartz). Loyal companions keep ability; stray pass to left after use.  
- **Deeds**: Hidden objectives. Gain bonus when acquired. Score VP, coins, or prestige at end.
