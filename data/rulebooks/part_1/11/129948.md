## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Each player leads a princely family tasked with building magnificent structures across the cities of Carrara. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VPs) by constructing buildings, scoring cities and building types, collecting objects, and fulfilling endgame objectives. The King will inspect progress during scoring events, rewarding families with VPs, coins, and rare objects. Victory is determined through final scoring after the game ends.

- Place 1 block of each color in Section I of the wheel (6 total).  
- Shuffle building tiles and place 9 face-up on the board.  
- Place remaining buildings face-down as draw pile.  
- Place one object of each type on the board; rest beside board.  
- Place 8-cost buildings face-up beside board.  
- Place 8 upgrade tiles beside board.  
- Shuffle each deck of objective cards (brown, purple, gray, green); draw one of each and place on Objectives board.  
- Each player takes:  
  - A player board (use advanced side for expansion)  
  - A screen  
  - 20 coins  
  - 1 starting block (1st: black, 2nd: blue, 3rd: green, 4th: red)  
  - 8 scoring markers: 1 placed on scoring track at 0, 7 kept in reserve  
- Place point markers in general supply.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise, choosing one of three actions:

#### a) Buy Blocks  
1. **Optional (Advanced)**: Choose to rotate the wheel or not.  
   - If rotating: turn wheel clockwise one section.  
2. **Refill Section I**: Draw blocks from bag and place in Section I until total blocks on wheel = 11. (Skip if not rotating or bag empty.)  
3. **Buy blocks**: Select one section. Buy any number of blocks from that section.  
   - Cost depends on section and color (e.g., Section I: white=$6, yellow=$5, red=$4, etc.).  
   - If color not shown in section, blocks of that color are free.  
   - Must buy at least one block if possible.  
   - If unable to buy (no money or no free blocks), reveal holdings, take $2 from bank.  
   - After purchase, blocks go behind player screen.

*Special Cases*:  
- Bag empty: no refill, but action may proceed.  
- Wheel and bag empty: cannot perform action unless another action is possible.  
- No rotation option only available if expansion is used.

#### b) Build Buildings  
1. Take one of the 9 face-up buildings from the board.  
2. Build it in one of the 6 cities on your player board.  
3. Pay cost by returning blocks to the bag.  
   - Block colors used determine eligible cities:  
     - Livorno, Pisa, Lucca: accept all colors  
     - Viareggio: no white/yellow  
     - Massa: no white/yellow/red  
     - Lerici: no white/yellow/red/green  
   - If multiple colors used, city must accept the "worst" (most restricted) color.  
4. Refill building space from draw pile.  
5. **Advanced Only**:  
   - Building an 8-cost building grants an upgrade tile (choose one available).  
   - May **upgrade** an existing building by replacing it with a higher-cost one, paying only the difference. New building can be different type. Old tile is removed from game.

#### c) Score  
Player may score one of the following. Each scoring option may be used only once per game.

**i. Score by Building Type**  
1. Choose a building type you have built (e.g., Palazzo).  
2. Score all buildings of that type:  
   - For each, multiply building cost × city value (x3, x2, etc.).  
   - Choose VP or $ for each building (e.g., x3 city gives 3VP or $3 per cost point).  
3. Take 1 object per building scored (based on building’s object icon).  
4. Place scoring marker on that type on your player board.

**ii. Score a City**  
1. Choose an unmarked city on game board.  
2. Must have built minimum buildings:  
   - Livorno, Pisa, Lucca: 2 buildings  
   - Viareggio, Massa, Lerici: 3 buildings  
3. Add total cost of all buildings in that city, multiply by city value.  
4. Choose VP or $ for entire sum.  
5. Take 1 object per building in the city.  
6. Place scoring marker on city on game board.

**iii. Score by Building Category (Advanced Only)**  
1. Choose either City (orange) or Land (green) buildings.  
2. Add total cost of all buildings in chosen category.  
3. Multiply by category value:  
   - City: ×$1 per cost point  
   - Land: ×1 VP per cost point  
4. No objects collected.  
5. Place scoring marker on corresponding space on player board.

*After any scoring action, move scoring marker on track and store coins/objects behind screen.*

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Hidden Resources**: Blocks, coins, and objects are kept private.  
- **Wheel Mechanic**: Rotating wheel changes block availability and cost by section.  
- **Scoring Limits**: 6 scoring actions per player (6 markers).  
- **Upgrade Tiles (Advanced)**:  
  - Acquired only by building an 8-cost building.  
  - Placed on city or building category space to increase its value.  
  - Each tile is unique; once taken, not available to others.  
- **Additional Purchase**: After any action, spend $10 to buy one object from board (only one per object type per game). Objects not replenished.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game ends when**:  
1. The 30th building is built, OR  
2. A player completes all three objective card conditions **and** announces game end.  

**Announcing End**:  
- Player must have met all three conditions (minimums on Top, Object, and Building cards).  
- Announce after completing action.  
- Immediately gain 5 VPs.  
- Complete current round (all players get equal turns).  
- Only one player may announce end; others cannot even if they meet conditions.

**Final Scoring (All Players)**:  
- **Object Card (purple)**: Score as specified (e.g., 3VP per object, or 5VP per pair, etc.).  
- **Building Card (gray)**: Score as specified (e.g., sum of building costs, or fixed bonuses).  
- **Coins**: Every $5 = 1 VP (unless Object Card specifies $2 = 1 VP).  
- **Advanced Only**:  
  - Each object **not** counted by Object Card = 1 VP.  
  - Apply Bonus Points Card (green) effects (e.g., most buildings in city, etc.).  

**Tiebreaker**: Player with the most blocks wins. If still tied, multiple winners.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I score a building type I’ve upgraded?** Yes. Score based on final building cost and location.  
- **Can I score a city with mixed building types?** Yes. All buildings in that city count.  
- **What if I can’t rotate or refill the wheel?** You may still buy blocks from current wheel layout.  
- **Can I buy an object if none are on the board?** No. Purchase only possible if object is available.  
- **Can I announce game end on my first turn?** Yes, if all conditions are met.  
- **What if I announce end but fail verification?** Game continues. No penalty, but no 5VP bonus.  
- **Do upgrade tiles affect scoring?** Yes. Use updated city or category values when scoring.
