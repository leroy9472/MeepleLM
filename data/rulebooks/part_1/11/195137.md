### 1. Lore & Objective
Catacombs is a dexterity-based board game where one player takes on the role of the Overseer, controlling monsters and the Catacomb Lord, while 2–5 other players control Heroes exploring a dungeon. The Heroes aim to survive increasingly difficult rooms, collect gold, purchase items, and ultimately defeat the Catacomb Lord in the final battle. The Overseer’s objective is to eliminate all Heroes before they destroy the Catacomb Lord.

### 2. Components
- Hero player mats, portrait cards, and rules cards
- Catacomb Lord player mat, portrait card, setup card, and rules card
- Monster pieces and monster cards (by family: Dungeon, Infernal, Mythological, Undead, Vermin)
- Room cards (Battle and Special)
- Item cards and spell cards
- Poison cards
- Gold coins
- Shot pieces: Melee, Rush, Missile, Fireball, Giant Fireball, Boulder, Ice, Shield, Target, Lightning, Hook
- Special tokens: Devoured! card, Teleported! card, Spring Tokens, Wyvern Egg Tokens
- Barrier walls
- Health trackers
- Familiar and ally pieces

### 3. Setup
1. **Choose Sides**: One player is the Overseer; others control Heroes (1–2 Heroes each depending on player count).
2. **Select Heroes and Catacomb Lord**: Players choose 4 Heroes; players and Overseer agree on a Catacomb Lord (from Sorcerer to Dragon in increasing difficulty).
3. **Distribute Components**: Each Hero player receives their hero mat, portrait card, rules card, starting items/spells, and wooden piece. The Overseer receives the Catacomb Lord mat, cards, and controls monster pool and gold.
4. **Prepare Room Deck**: Sort room cards into Level 0, 1, and 2 decks. Shuffle and stack in order: Level 0 > Level 1 > Merchant > Level 1 > Level 1 > Healer > Level 2 > Catacomb Lord’s Lair.
5. **Board Setup**: Unfold barrier walls. Place all components outside. The space between the board and walls is the Shadow Realm.
6. **Starting Gold**: Begin with 5 gold unless otherwise agreed.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Exploration Phase**: Flip the next room card.
2. **Setup Phase**:
   - Place the board and obstacles.
   - The Overseer sets up monsters in the monster start zone.
   - Heroes place their pieces in the hero start zone.
3. **Battle Phase**:
   - Heroes take turns performing one action each (basic shot sequence, item, spell, or ability).
   - Order is player-determined.
   - After all Heroes act, the Overseer activates each monster using their shot sequences.
   - Rounds repeat until all monsters are destroyed/frozen or all Heroes are dead.
4. **Resolution Phase** (if at least one Hero survives):
   - Heroes collect gold equal to the value of monsters they destroyed.
   - Return monster pieces to the pool.
5. Proceed to the next room.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Shots
- **Melee**: Flick hero/monster piece; 1 damage.
- **Rush**: Same as melee, no damage; used for movement.
- **Bite**: 2 damage melee.
- **Ranged Shots**: Use separate pieces placed within 2.5 cm (1") of the attacker:
  - Missile: 1 damage.
  - Fireball: 1 damage.
  - Giant Fireball: 2 damage.
  - Boulder: 3 damage.
  - Ice: Freezes target (cannot act until ice is knocked off); Catacomb Lords immune.
  - Target: Second chance if first shot misses; damage only to declared target.
  - Shield: No damage; used for positioning; returned near owner after sequence.
- **Roll Shot**: Roll character piece on its side; 2 damage if it hits.

#### Shot Sequences
- A sequence consists of multiple shots (e.g., Rush > Melee).
- “Or” indicates a choice; must be declared before acting.
- If part of a sequence is impossible, skip it and continue.

#### Shot Modifiers
- **Chain (Yellow)**: Cannot damage the same target consecutively in a sequence.
- **Critical (Red)**: +1 damage.
- **Fear (White)**: Attacker may immediately rush the target piece.
- **Petrify (Gray)**: Target is instantly removed from the game (Heroes only).
- **Poison (Green)**: Target loses 1 HP and draws poison cards; death if total poison ≥ starting HP.
- **Corrosion (Brown)**: Randomly destroy one of the target’s item cards (or lose 3 gold if none).
- **Stun (Blue)**: Target can only perform Rush shots until hit by a teammate’s melee/rush.
- **Regeneration (Pink)**: Restore 1 HP after damaging an enemy.
- **Transform (Purple)**: Monster changes form after hitting (e.g., Fire Spirit → Fire Wall).
- **Devour (Overseer only)**: Target takes 1 damage and is placed on Devoured! card (removed from play until room ends or monster is destroyed). Only one character per shot.

#### Defensive Properties
- **Nullify**: Prevents damage and effects of specific shots.
- **Reflect**: Nullifies shot and deals 1 damage back to attacker.

#### Special Actions
- **Summon**: Place a monster within 2.5 cm of the summoner; it performs a melee shot and its full sequence.
- **Open Portal**: Swap positions of two friendly pieces.
- **Teleport**: Hero removed and placed on Teleported! card; returns next turn with a melee shot.
- **Repeat**: Monster takes another turn immediately.

#### Monster Types
