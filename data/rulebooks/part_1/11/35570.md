## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Tinners' Trail is set in early 19th-century Cornwall, focusing on the tin and copper mining industry. Players represent mining conglomerates competing to earn the most victory points (VPs) through external investments. The game emphasizes historical elements such as water flooding in mines, technological developments (e.g., steam pumps, adits, ports, trains), and fluctuating ore prices. Victory is achieved by strategically investing money earned from mining into external ventures, with VPs being the sole source of scoring.

2. Components  
- Game board depicting Cornish mining regions  
- 24 Mine pieces (6 per player)  
- 12 Player tokens (3 per player): used for money, time, and order of play  
- 48 Investment cubes (12 per player)  
- 8 Steam pump discs  
- 10 Miner pieces  
- 8 Port pieces  
- 3 Train pieces  
- 4 Adit pieces  
- 65 Water cubes (blue)  
- 60 Copper cubes (orange)  
- 50 Tin cubes (white)  
- 3 special dice (showing tin, copper, and water)  
- Money and Time tracks on board  
- Investment Display (4 columns, one per turn)  
- Ore Price table (shows market values based on die rolls)  
- Available Developments box  
- Order of Play box  

3. Setup  
- Each player selects a color and takes:  
  - 6 mines  
  - 3 player tokens (for money/time tracking and order of play)  
  - 12 investment cubes  
- Randomly determine starting player order; place tokens in the Order of Play box from top to bottom.  
- Seed starting areas with printed copper/tin cubes. For each such area, roll all 3 special dice and add corresponding cubes (white for tin, orange for copper, blue for water).  
- Clear areas (8 total) start empty and are not seeded at setup.  
- Each player starts with £15: place one token at £15 and another at £0 on the Money Track.  
- Set up Available Developments box and Steam Pump discs per turn 1 schedule:  
  - Miners, ports, trains, adits: place 1 of each in the box.  
  - Steam Pumps: place 1 disc in the first box.  
- Place black pawn (auction marker) near the board.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 4 turns. Each turn follows 7 phases:

**Phase 1: Determine Ore Prices**  
- Roll 3 dice and sum for tin price. Roll again for copper.  
- Modify result:  
  - +1 if it’s Turn 1.  
  - -1 if it’s Turn 4.  
  - +1 if previous price was at minimum.  
  - -1 if previous price was at maximum.  
- Place a white (tin) or orange (copper) cube on the Ore Price table to mark current prices.

**Phase 2: Available Developments**  
- Remove leftover developments from previous turn.  
- Refill Available Developments box per turn schedule:  
  - Turn 1: 1 miner, 1 port, 1 train, 1 adit  
  - Turn 2: 2 miners, 2 ports, 2 trains, 1 adit  
  - Turn 3: 2 miners, 2 ports, 2 trains, 1 adit  
  - Turn 4: 2 miners, 2 ports, 2 trains, 1 adit  
- Add Steam Pump discs cumulatively:  
  - Turn 1: 1 stack of 1 disc  
  - Turn 2: stacks of 1 and 2 discs  
  - Turn 3: stacks of 1, 2, and 2 discs  
  - Turn 4: stacks of 1, 2, 2, and 3 discs  
- The "Improve Steam Pumps" action can be taken once per available stack.

**Phase 3: Player Actions**  
- Players take actions in order determined by:  
  - Initially: player highest in Order of Play box.  
  - After first action: player with least Time Points spent. Ties broken by position in Order of Play (top first).  
- Each action costs Time Points (1–3); players have 10 Time Points per turn.  
- Actions (in order of typical use):  

| Action | Time Cost | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Build Mine** | 2 | Auction for right to build in an area with no mine. Winner pays bid, places mine. If area was clear, roll dice after auction to add cubes. Max 6 mines per player. |
| **Mine Ore** | 1 | From area with your mine: take up to Mining Capacity cubes (mix of tin/copper). Cost per cube = number of water cubes in area. After mining, add 1 water cube to area. Base capacity = 2; +1 per port, miner, or train in area. |
| **Place Miner** | 1 | Add miner to any area. Increases Mining Capacity by 1 in that area. Max 1 per area. |
| **Build Port** | 2 | Only in coastal areas. Remove 1 water cube. Increases Mining Capacity by 1. Max 1 per area. |
| **Build Adit** | 3 | Place across border between two adjacent areas. Remove 1 water cube from each area. Add 1 copper and 1 tin to each area. Max 1 adit per border. If area is clear, effects apply when cubes are later added. |
| **Build Train** | 2 | In any area. Remove 2 water cubes from that area. Remove 1 water cube from each adjacent area. Increases Mining Capacity by 1 in that area only. Max 1 per area. |
| **Improve Steam Pumps** | 1 | Take one stack of steam pump discs. Remove 1 water cube per disc, from any areas. Discs returned to supply after use. |
| **Sell Pasties** | 1 | Gain £1. |
| **Pass** | 0 | Move token to leftmost empty space in Order of Play box. Cannot act further. When only one player remains active, they may take one final action before passing. |

- Auctions: Active player selects area. Bidding starts at £1, clockwise. Winner pays bid, spends 2 Time Points, places mine. Non-winning active player remains active.
- Developments can be placed on any area (yours or unowned), but only one of each type per area (except steam pumps, which are temporary).
- Phase ends when all players pass.

**Phase 4: Sell Ore**  
- Sell all tin and copper cubes at current market prices (from Ore Price table).  
- Add revenue to money total.  
- Return cubes to supply.  
- Cannot carry ore between turns.

**Phase 5: External Investments**  
- Players invest in turn order (Order of Play box), round-robin style.  
- On your turn, you may:  
  - Place one investment cube in any available space in the current turn’s column.  
  - Pay the cost shown (left of box); gain VPs shown (in box).  
  - Max 2 cubes per box (same or different players).  
  - Max 12 cubes per player over game.  
- Repeat investment rounds until all players pass.  
- **This is the only way to score VPs.**

**Phase 6: Prospecting**  
- First and second players in Order of Play box each choose a different clear area (no cubes, no mine).  
- Roll 3 dice and add cubes as shown.  
- Modify roll based on developments:  
  - **Adit connected**: -1 water, +1 tin, +1 copper per adit.  
  - **Train in area**: -2 water.  
  - **Each adjacent train**: -1 water.  
  - **Port in area**: -1 water.  
- If no clear areas remain, skip this phase.

**Phase 7: End of Turn**  
- Proceed to next turn. Game ends after Turn 4.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Time Track System**: Controls action order. Players with fewer Time Points spent act next. Passing locks in turn order for next round.  
- **Water Management**: Central challenge. Water increases mining cost and accumulates after mining. Removed via ports, trains, adits, steam pumps.  
- **Ore Price Fluctuation**: Random with modifiers based on turn and previous extremes. Drives strategic timing of mining.  
- **Investment Decay**: Earlier investments yield higher VP returns. Forces trade-off between liquidity and scoring.  
- **Area Development Synergy**: Adits benefit two areas; trains drain adjacent regions; ports require coast.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after Turn 4.  
- Score VPs from investment cubes on Investment Display.  
- **Tiebreakers in order**:  
  1. Most money.  
  2. Most tin and copper cubes in areas with your mines.  
  3. Highest position in Order of Play box.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build a mine in a clear area?** Yes. Roll dice to add cubes after winning auction.  
- **Can I mine in an area with no water?** Yes. Cost is £0 per cube.  
- **Can I use steam pumps on any area?** Yes, even unowned or mine-less areas.  
- **What if I run out of Time Points?** You must pass.

- **Do adits add cubes to empty areas?** No. Effects are deferred until cubes are added.  
- **Can I build a port inland?** No. Must border sea.  
- **Does train increase capacity in adjacent areas?** No. Only in its own area.  
- **Can I save steam pump discs?** No. Must use or lose them in the same action.
