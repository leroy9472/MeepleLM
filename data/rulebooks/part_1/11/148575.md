# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Marvel Dice Masters is a two-player dice-building game where players act as masterminds commanding teams of Marvel characters to battle each other. The goal is to reduce the opponent's life to zero through strategic dice rolling, character deployment, and ability usage. This manual includes both standard rules and a solitaire variant.

## 2. Components
- Custom dice (character and action dice)
- Character cards
- Basic action cards
- Color reminder cards
- Two dice bags
- Play mat or designated play areas (Bag, Prep Area, Reserve Pool, Field, Attack Zone, Used Pile)

## 3. Setup
### Standard Setup:
1. Each player chooses a team according to chosen format (Basic, Tournament, Draft)
2. Place basic action cards in center of table with three matching dice each
3. Place player-specific character cards near each player with their dice
4. Each player places 8 sidekick dice in their bag
5. Determine starting player
6. Set starting life (10 for learning game, 15 for Basic, 20 for Tournament)

### Solitaire Variant Setup:
1. Player assembles their deck and dice collection
2. Create a "Scripted Opponent" (S.O.) deck using same rules
3. Set up two parallel rows of character/action cards organized by cost
4. Basic actions in a row between them
5. Both player and S.O. start with 8 sidekick dice and chosen life total

## 4. Gameplay Flow
### Turn Order:
1. **Clear and Draw Step**
2. **Roll and Reroll Step**
3. **Main Step**
4. **Attack Step**
5. **Clean Up**

### Scripted Opponent Purchasing Rules:
- Player always takes first turn
- When player purchases dice, S.O. automatically purchases same number of dice
- S.O. purchases from least expensive to most expensive cards
- S.O. does not purchase dice during their own turn

### Scripted Opponent Decision Rules (THE GOLDEN RULE):
When S.O. has choices regarding abilities, globals, or effects, follow the scripted decision tree in exact order.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Energy Types:
- Fist (melee)
- Bolt (blasts)
- Mask (wits)
- Shield (toughness)
- Generic (determination) - worth 2 energy but cannot pay specific costs
- Wildcard (?) - becomes any single energy type

### Turn Steps:
**Clear and Draw Step:**
- Move all unused energy from reserve pool to used pile
- Draw 4 dice from bag
- If bag has fewer than 4 dice, refill from used pile and draw to 4
- If still fewer than 4 dice drawn, take 1 damage and gain 1 generic energy per die short

**Roll and Reroll Step:**
- Roll all dice in prep area plus newly drawn dice
- Choose any/all dice to reroll simultaneously (one reroll opportunity)
- Place all rolled dice in reserve pool
- For S.O.: Roll all dice in prep area, keep character/action faces, reroll others once

**Main Step:**
- Perform any number of actions in any order:
  - Purchase dice by paying energy cost
  - Field characters by paying fielding cost
  - Use action dice
  - Use global abilities
- Both players can use global abilities
- At end: unfielded characters go to used pile

**S.O. Main Step Sub-steps (in order):**
1. **Play Actions:** Must play all actions suitable for Main Step
2. **Field Characters:** Must field all affordable characters starting from most expensive
3. **Use Global Abilities:** Must use all affordable Globals suitable for Main Step

**Attack Step:**
1. **Declare Attackers:** Attacking player moves characters to attack zone
2. **Declare Blockers:** Defending player assigns blockers
3. **Use Actions and Global Abilities:** Attacking player first, then both players
4. **Assign and Resolve Damage:** Simultaneously

**S.O. Attack Step Rules:**
- **Declare Attackers:** Must keep 2 characters passive (ideally sidekick + character), attack with others
- Exception: If total attack value ≥ player's life, attack with all characters
- **Declare Blockers:** Must defend if able
  - Start with lowest defense character blocking highest attack attacker
  - Continue in order of ascending defense vs descending attack
  - Can assign up to 2 blockers per attacker
- **Play Actions:** Must play all remaining actions in reserve
- **Use Global Abilities:** Must use all affordable Globals

**Clean Up:**
- Characters that blocked (or were blocked) but weren't knocked out return to field
- All damage cleared from dice
- Unblocked attacking characters go to used pile
- All actions in reserve pool go to used pile
- All card effects end (except "while active" effects)

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends immediately when a player's life reaches zero
- Player who reduces opponent's life to zero wins
- No life can go below zero
- Player cannot gain life beyond starting amount

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
**Q: Can unused non-generic energy be moved to used pile without spending?**
A: No. Energy must be spent or retained.

**Q: When can opponents use global abilities?**
A: During Main Step after each action, and during Attack Step after blockers declared. Reactives can be used when appropriate (e.g., after damage assigned).

**Q: Do simultaneous effects resolve at the same time?**
A: No. Active player's effects resolve first, then inactive player's. Within a player's effects, player chooses order.

**Q: What happens when a bag is empty during draw?**
A: Move all dice from used pile to bag, shuffle, then draw.

**Q: Can you avoid paying costs?**
A: No. If you cannot pay a cost, you cannot perform the action.

**Q: How do burst symbols work?**
A: Mandatory effects that trigger when rolled. One burst (★) and two bursts (★★) are different. Card must have matching burst text.

**Q: What does "while active" mean?**
A: When one or more dice of that character are in the field. Effect occurs once regardless of number of copies.

**Q: Can you partially spend energy dice?**
A: Yes for non-generic energy dice. Spin down to lower energy face. Generic energy cannot be partially spent.

**Q: How are global abilities used?**
A: Available to both players. Can be used multiple times if cost paid multiple times. Active player has priority when both want to use simultaneously.
