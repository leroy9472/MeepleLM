## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Brew Crafters*, players compete to build the most successful brewery over 3 years (12 seasons). The goal is to earn the most reputation points (RP) by brewing beer, upgrading facilities, conducting research, and completing special actions. The player with the highest reputation at the end of the game wins. Tiebreaker: most money; if still tied, shared victory.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each season has 4 phases:

#### 1. Restock Phase  
- **Market Action Board**: Add ingredients/money as shown by orange arrows on spaces. Accumulate leftovers.  
- **Brewery Board – Farm**:  
  - Spring: Plant ≤2 Hops/Fruit from storehouse.  
  - Fall: Each Hops → 3 Hops; each Fruit → 2 Fruit. Any remaining rots after fall.  
- **HI – Hire Interns**: If you hired interns 1–2 seasons ago, take an intern from this season’s space.  
- **CF – Community Farm**: Winter/Spring: Add 1 Malt/Hops/Fruit to CF space; take topmost (lowest-numbered) CF token.

#### 2. Market Action Phase (Turn Order)  
- Players place one shopper per unoccupied Market Action space (only one per space).  
- Actions:  
  - **Non-Restocking**: Do what it says.  
  - **Restocking**: Take all accumulated goods (even if exceeding storage).  
  - **Private Investor**: Become next Start Player in Brewery Phase.  
  - **Form Local Partnership**: Take one remaining Local Partnership card.  
  - **Hire New Shift**:  
    - 2nd shift ($$): Must have brewed 3 batches (any type).  
    - 3rd shift ($$$): Must have brewed 9 batches.

  - **TM – Traders Market**: Make 1 of the listed trades.  
  - **EA – Employment Agency**: Do what it says (varies).  
  - **CF – Community Farm**: Same as restock phase.

#### 3. Brewery Phase (Turn Order)  
- Players place hired brewery shifts on Brewery Action Board (multiple allowed per space).  

**Actions**:

  - *Farm*: Gain 1 Hops or 1 Fruit immediately. Use for planting/harvesting.  
  - *Mash Tun*: Gain 1 Malt per full season remaining (max 6). When brewing 2 batches in Double System, use 1 less Malt per batch. Cannot use with Brewpub.

  - *Hops Infusers*: Gain 1 Hops. Add marker to each fermentation tank (1 in Single, 2 in Double, 1 in Brewpub). When brewing **ales**, pay +1 Hops to gain 2 RP immediately.

- **Process Beer and/or Collaborate**:

  2. Move BREW → BOTTLE.  
  3. Brew up to:  
     - 1 batch (Single),  
     - 2 batches (Double),

- **Collaborate** (3–5p only): Do what Collaboration area says; take Collaboration token.

- **DSR – Develop Secret Recipe**: Choose unused advanced recipe; place face up/down in front of you. Place 5-RP coin on it (gold medal). Only you can brew it, but must reveal to do so.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Worker Placement**: Two types:  
  - Market Phase: 1 shopper per space.  
  - Brewery Phase: Multiple shifts allowed per space.  
- **Resource Management**: Store up to 12 ingredients unless Storehouse built. Overflow → discard down to capacity.  
- **Brewing**:  
  - Basic → Advanced unlock.  
  - Brewpub bypasses bottling.  
  - Double System allows 2 batches.  
- **Payment Timing**: All $ costs paid at end of **Winter**, not when acquired.  
- **Special Effects (from cards/tiles)**:  
  - *Malt/Hops/Yeast Converters*, *Purchaser*, *Spices Importer*, *Coffee Roaster*  
  - Seasonal: Planting (Spring), Harvest (Fall), Holiday Help (free action), Market Helper (extra Market action + 1 Malt)  
  - Market Triggers: e.g., Malt Buyer (4 Malt for $1), Logistics Coordinator (+1 Malt/Hops if ≥2 types)  
  - Brewery Triggers: e.g., Brewing Breakthrough (+1 RP per batch), Brewmaster (+1 RP for 2 batches, +3 for 3), Growth & Management (+2 RP for new recipe)  
  - Endgame Scoring Bonuses: e.g., Tasting Room Manager (score Tasting Room value), Marketing Specialist (+1 RP per gold label), Operations (1 RP per built building)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Storage Overflow**: If receiving more ingredients than capacity, take all, then discard down to limit.  
- **Double Processing & Mash Tun**: When brewing 2 batches, use 1 less Malt per batch. Only works with Double System.  
- **Hops Infusers**: Only grant +2 RP when brewing **ales** and paying +1 Hops. Markers placed on all tanks (Single: 1, Double: 2, Brewpub: 1).  
- **Tour & Tasting Room Installation**: Must have: 2nd shift, ≥$6 on board, brewed 1 advanced recipe. Grants immediate RP = full seasons remaining.  
- **Secret Recipes**: Can be brewed only by owner; must be revealed when used. Counts toward Tour & Tasting Room scoring.  
- **Community Farm**: Tokens drafted in order (1 → 4). Harvest split equally; remainder drafted by token order.  
- **Interns**: Can substitute for shoppers or shifts. Return to supply at end of season if used or claimed but unused.  
- **Payment**: All $ costs (shifts, board, skilled workers) paid **only in Winter**, all at once.
