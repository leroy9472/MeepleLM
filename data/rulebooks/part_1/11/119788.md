3. Setup  
1. Assign Components:  
   - Each player chooses or randomly draws a race and receives:  
     - Homeland tile  
     - Matching Player Board  
     - 10 miniatures  
     - Cloth bag  
     - 6 Development markers  
     - 6 Civilization Cubes (1 each of Red, Green, Purple, Blue, Orange, Yellow)  
2. Determine First Player: Randomly select.  
3. Mapmaking:  
   - Randomly place 1 Central Hexagon tile face-down at the center.  
   - Place 6 Borderland Hexagon tiles face-down around it.  
   - For 5 players, add 2 extra Borderland tiles on opposite sides.  
   - Each player connects their Homeland tile to the map as shown in diagrams.  
   - Place 3 miniatures of each player’s race in their Capital City hex (outside the city).  
4. Ruin Tokens:  
   - Sort by back (bronze, silver, gold) and shuffle separately.  
   - Place 2 face-down Ruin tokens on each Ruin space in Homelands.  
   - When hexagons are revealed, place 2 Ruin tokens (silver on Borderlands, 3 gold on Central Hexagon Ruin spaces) and 1 Ghost miniature per city and Ruin stack.  
   - Optional: Play with full map visible from start.  
5. Race War Only:  
   - Shuffle Homelands face-up (Neutral side) and let players choose.  
   - Each player picks one of their two Race Tiles and applies its effects.  
6. Extra Cube & Development Markers:  
   - Each player takes 1 extra Civilization Cube (any non-grey color) and places all cubes in their bag.  
   - Place Development markers: 1 at level 3, 1 at level 2, 1 at level 1, 3 at level 0 (on any rows).  
7. Advanced Technology Cards:  
   - Divide 64 cards into 4 decks by type:  
     - Deck I: Exploration & Warfare  
     - Deck II: Trade & Growth  
     - Deck III: Progress & Science  
     - Deck IV: Conversion & Renewal  
   - Shuffle each deck. Reveal 2 cards from each (8 total), placing a grey cube on each as a placeholder.  
8. Starting Cubes:  
   - Each player draws 3 random cubes from their bag and places them in the “available cubes area” on their board.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Players take turns in clockwise order.  
- On a turn:  
  1. Upkeep:  
     - Remove all Fortress tokens in play.  
     - If fewer than 3 miniatures on board, place from reserve to Capital City to reach 3.  
     - Resolve any “beginning of turn” effects.  
  2. Actions (in any order):  
     - Mandatory: Place all cubes from “available cubes area” onto technology activation spaces or into “unused cubes area”.  
     - Optional: Activate cities, explore ruins, upgrade civilization.  
  3. End of Turn Phase:  
     - Move remaining “available cubes” to “unused cubes area”.  
     - If bag has cubes: draw up to 3.  
     - If bag is empty: perform Reset, then draw 3 cubes.  
- Reset (triggered when bag is empty or at end of turn when applicable):  
  - Move miniatures from cities and ruins to outside (same hex).  
  - Return all cubes from “unused cubes area” and activated technologies to bag.  
  - Cubes on incomplete or continuous-effect technologies may be kept or returned (player’s choice).  
  - Shuffle bag and draw 3 cubes.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Technology Activation**:  
  - Base Technologies (on Player Board): Two mutually exclusive activation sets. Completing one set activates its effect. Cubes remain until Reset.  
  - Advanced Technology Cards: One activation set. Completing it grants effect.  
  - Cubes may be placed in any order. Grey cubes only go on grey spaces.  
- **City Activation**:  
  - Move a miniature into an unoccupied city. Gain effect immediately. Miniature is locked until Reset.  
- **Exploring Ruins**:  
  - Move a miniature into an unoccupied ruin with tokens. Take top token. Can use immediately or store (max 1 stored). Miniature locked until Reset.  
- **Upgrade Civilization**:  
  - Reduce a Development marker:  
    - Level 4 or 5 → 0: gain 1 cube of that color.  
    - Level 6 → 0: gain 2 cubes of that color.  
  - Only if cubes are available in reserve.  
- **Movement**:  
  - 1 Movement point = move 1 hex.  
  - Terrain costs:  
    - Enter forest or mountain: +1 MP  
    - Exit mountain or swamp: +1 MP  
    - Between same terrain: no extra cost  
  - If entering hex with enemy (not in city/ruin), movement stops. Must attack to continue.  
- **Attack**:  
  - 1 Attack point removes 1 Ghost or enemy miniature.  
  - Fortresses absorb attacks first.  
  - Killing second+ enemy of same color returns it to owner; if player has killed one of each opponent, gain 1 Gem.  
- **Ranged Attack**:  
  - Attack adjacent hex. No VP for kill. Ghosts removed from game; enemy miniatures returned to reserve.  
- **Fortress**:  
  - Place token in hex with own miniature. Absorbs 1 attack. Removed at start of next turn.  
- **Miniature**:  
  - Place one from reserve in a Homeland city hex (outside city).  
- **Develop**:  
  - Advance Development markers. Multipliers (2x, 3x) can be split across rows.  
- **Gem**:  
  - Gain 1 VP (Gem).  
- **Advanced Technology Effects**:  
  - **Cloning**: Place miniature in any hex with own presence.  
  - **Cube Drawing**: Draw cubes from bag to “available cubes area”.  
  - **Cube Generation**: Add cube from reserve to bag.  
  - **Cube Restoration**: Return one cube from board to bag.  
  - **Espionage**: Copy effect of opponent’s Advanced Technology.  
  - **Fly**: Flying movement ignores terrain and enemy blocking.  
  - **Negative Develop**: Force opponent to decrease one Development marker.  
  - **Continuous Effects**: Last until game end. Cubes may remain during Reset.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Game Conditions** (triggered during a player’s turn):  
  - Short Game: 1 condition  
  - Regular Game: 2 different conditions  
  - Long Game: All 3 conditions  
  1. Player has 12+ VP (2 players: 15+)  
  2. Player acquires 5th Advanced Technology  
  3. Player places last miniature on map  
  - When triggered, player gains corresponding Objective Tile(s). All other players get one final turn.  
  - Note: “Prime Objective” variant replaces “Last Miniature Placed” with: any player with a miniature in the Central Hexagon (free of enemies/Ghosts/ruins) at the start of their turn gains the “Last Miniature Placed” Objective Tile.  

- **Final Scoring**:  
  1. **VP Area**: 1 VP per Gem  
  2. **Ghosts Killed**:  
     - 1 Ghost = 1 VP  
     - 2 Ghosts = 3 VP  
     - 3 Ghosts = 6 VP  
     - 4+ Ghosts = 6 + (n–3) VP  
  3. **Enemy Miniatures Killed**:  
     - 1 VP per enemy killed  
     - Only after completing a full set (one per opponent), successive kills grant VP  
  4. **Civilization Cubes**: 1 VP per non-grey cube owned  
  5. **Objective Tiles**: 2 VP each  
  6. **Advanced Technology Cards**: VP value printed on card  
  7. **Territory Control**:  
     - Homeland Hexagon: 1 VP each  
     - Borderland Hexagon: 2 VP each  
     - Central Hexagon: 4 VP  
     - Control: majority of miniatures in hexagon  
     - Ghosts count: if Ghosts ≥ all players’ miniatures, no control  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Most hexagons controlled (by count)  
  2. Most non-grey cubes  
  3. Last in turn order

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Cubes on Technologies**:  
  - Cubes stay on technologies after activation until Reset.  
  - Only cubes on continuous-effect technologies may be left during Reset (even if incomplete).  
  - Cubes on non-continuous or activated techs must go back to bag.  
- **Technology Activation Order**:  
  - Effects may be used in any order, even interwoven with other actions.  
- **Plundering with No Gems**:  
  - If adjacent opponent has no Gems, effect does nothing for that player.  
- **Game End via Adjacent Effect**:  
  - Only the active player can trigger end game. Others get one final turn.  
- **Espionage Loops**:  
  - “Espionage” cannot target another “espionage” effect.  
  - “Cube restoration” effects cannot target other restoration effects.  
- **Corruption Effect**:  
  - Cannot skip cube removal. Must fulfill all effects to activate.
