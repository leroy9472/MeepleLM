## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the year 2075, cats have taken control of Earth and now seek cosmic dominance. Players lead rival Cat Aeronautics and Space Agency centers, competing to send astronauts into space to explore planets, moons, and deep space. The goal is to score the most points through exploration, completing goals, and fulfilling special conditions. The game ends when one player places all 8 of their astronauts in space or after 11 rocket failures. The player with the most points wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the **cosmic mat** in the center of the table.  
2. Place the **4 goal tokens** next to the mat.  
3. Form a **supply pile** of all point tokens, accessible to all players.  
4. Place the **cosmic failure token** on the first space of the cosmic failure track.  
5. Each player takes:  
   - A player board  
   - 8 astronaut tokens of one color  
   - 8 identical-function astronauts (no differentiation by player)  
6. **Optional Variants Setup:**  
   - **Exploration:** Shuffle 20 exploration tokens; place 5 face-up on designated spaces of the cosmic mat.  
   - **Secret Missions:** Deal 4 secret mission tokens to each player; each chooses 3 to keep (secret), returns 1.  
   - **UFO:** Shuffle 14 expedition tokens into a face-down pile. Place the **UFO marker** on space 25 (+ symbol). Place UFO tokens in a stack beside the mat, value 5 on top.  

The player who most recently piloted a rocket starts first.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **cosmic expeditions**, each led by a starting player (commander). Expeditions repeat until the game ends.

#### Cosmic Expedition Phases:
1. **Takeoff Phase**  
2. **Travel Phase(s)** (repeated until crash or disembarkation)  
3. **Landing Phase** (after each non-crashing travel)  
4. **End of Expedition**  

After each expedition, the **rocket board passes clockwise** to the next player.

---

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Takeoff Phase  
- The starting player places the **rocket marker** on space 0 of the cosmic mat.  
- They choose one of their astronauts and place it on the **first seat** of the rocket board.  
- Remaining players, in clockwise order, each place one astronaut on the next available seat.  
- The starting player becomes the **commander** until their astronaut disembarks or the rocket crashes.  

> **Astronaut Ability Note:** If the first astronaut has the satellite-start ability, the rocket starts at space 3 instead of 0.

---

#### Travel Phase  
Each travel phase has three stages:

**Stage 1: Roll and Group Dice**  
- The commander rolls **all available dice** (initially 6).  
- Group dice by result (each unique result is a group; single die may be a group).  
- Only dice matching **symbols adjacent to the rocket marker’s current space** may be used.  
  - Symbols:  
    - Dot (●): move 1 space  
    - Two dots (●●): move 2 spaces  
    - Three dots (●●●): move 3 spaces  
    - Afterburner (🔥): value = current space number (e.g., on space 4 → 🔥 = 4)  

**Stage 2: Choose and Move**  
- Commander selects **one or more full groups** of usable dice.  
- Rocket moves **sum of selected dice values**.  
- Multiple afterburner astronauts in rocket allow using more than one as value-1 die (see astronaut abilities).  

**Stage 3: Discard Used Dice**  
- Discard all **used non-afterburner** dice to the cosmic mat.  
- **Afterburner dice (🔥)** are **not discarded** — they remain for next travel phase.  
- If no dice remain for next phase, the commander takes one back (must always have at least one die).  

> Exception: If an expedition token grants “Keep the dice,” used dice are not discarded.

---

#### Crashing the Rocket  
- If **no rolled dice match** the symbols at the current space → **rocket crashes**.  
- Move **cosmic failure token** forward one space.  
- All astronauts still on rocket return to their owners’ player boards.  
- **Exception:** Astronauts with the “crash survival” ability may disembark if on a planet or unoccupied moon.  
- Expedition ends. Rocket board passes to next player.

---

#### Landing Phase  
Occurs after **every non-crash travel phase**, **only if rocket is on space 6 or higher**.

Each player, starting with the commander and proceeding **top to bottom** on the rocket board, chooses:  
- **Stay in rocket**, or  
- **Disembark** at current location.

##### Disembarking Options:

**On a Moon:**  
- Must be adjacent to current space.  
- Place astronaut on **unoccupied moon farthest from rocket** (highest value).  
- **Only one astronaut per moon.**  
- Immediate points: value shown on moon (1, 3, 5, or 10).  
- If all moons occupied → no one can disembark here.

**On a Planet:**  
- Must be adjacent to current space.  
- Place astronaut on planet. **No limit** on astronauts per planet.  
- **Points scored at end of game** based on majority control.  
- Stack astronauts **in order of disembarkation** (bottom to top).  
- Same-color astronauts: place side-by-side in a row.

**In Deep Space (space 25):**  
- **All astronauts must disembark.**  
- Commander’s astronaut → **comet**: 7 points  
- All others → **galaxy**: 5 points each  
- No limit on number per area.  
- Points awarded immediately.

---

#### Change of Commander  
- If the **current commander disembarks**, the **next astronaut on the rocket** becomes new commander.  
- New commander inherits **unused dice** and leads future rolls and decisions.  
- Rocket board remains with original holder (for turn order clarity).

---

#### Goals  
First player to meet a condition during a **landing phase** takes the corresponding **goal token** (only one player per goal):  
1. **4 astronauts on 4 different planets**  
2. **3 astronauts on 1 planet**  
3. **4 astronauts on 4 different moons**  
4. **2 astronauts in deep space** (comet or galaxy)  

Each goal token is worth **5 points** at endgame.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Triggers (whichever comes first):  
- A player places their **8th astronaut** in space → finish current expedition, then end game.  
- **11th rocket crash** → cosmic failure token reaches end → end game immediately.

#### Final Scoring  
Each player totals:  
1. **Immediate points from:**  
   - Moons (awarded when disembarking)  
   - Deep space (5 or 7 points)  
   - Exploration tokens (1/2/3 points each)  
   - UFO tokens (value shown)  
   - Goal tokens (5 each)  
   - Secret missions (2/5/10 each, if completed)  
2. **Endgame planet points:**  
   Score planets **in order from start to end** of track. For each planet:  
   - **1st place:** 5 points → to player with **most astronauts**  
   - **2nd place:** 3 points → to player with **second most**  
   - **3rd place:** 2 points → to **all other players with ≥1 astronaut**  
   - **Ties:** Player who **disembarked first** gets higher rank.  
   > Only one player can get 1st, one can get 2nd, all others with presence get 3rd.

#### Winning  
- Highest total score wins.  
- Tie → shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can the rocket start at space 3 more than once?**  
A: Yes, if the starting astronaut has the satellite ability, the rocket always starts at space 3, regardless of previous expeditions.

**Q: What happens if all dice are unusable but an afterburner astronaut is present?**  
A: If the current space allows movement with value 1 and an afterburner astronaut is in the rocket, the commander may use it as a die → no crash.

**Q: Can a player use multiple afterburner astronaut abilities in one travel phase?**  
A: Yes. Each afterburner astronaut can be used once per expedition. Commander may use multiple in one phase if desired.

**Q: What happens if the space-time tunnel moves the rocket onto another exploration token?**  
A: Immediately activate the new token. Repeat if chain continues.

**Q: Can a player complete a secret mission after placing the astronaut?**  
A: Yes, as long as the astronaut is placed on the correct moon or planet (matching the space number on the token), the mission is fulfilled when the condition is met during a landing phase.

**Q: Do planet points depend on order of placement?**  
A: Only for tie-breaking. Majority is based on count; order breaks ties.

**Q: Can a player disembark on a moon that’s not adjacent?**  
A: No. Only moons adjacent to the rocket’s current space are accessible.
