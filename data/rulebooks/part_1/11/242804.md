## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Lowlands*, players manage sheep farms in a low-lying region protected by a communal dike. Rising floodwaters threaten the land each round. Players must balance expanding their farms, breeding sheep, contributing to the dike, and managing resources. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game during the **Storm Surge Phase**, with ties broken by position on the Dike track.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### **Turn of the Tide**  
1. Each player discards down to **8 Resource cards**.  
2. Place **3 new Flood cards** face-down on each Sea space.  
3. Reveal the **leftmost face-down Flood card**.  
4. Add **Flood pieces** (blue tokens) equal to the number shown, left to right.  
   - When 12 Flood pieces are placed, start a new level (stack on top).  

#### **Work Phase**  
Players take turns placing **1 Farmer** on an Action Space. Each Farmer provides 2, 3, or 4 Action Points.  
- **Repeat Actions**: Pay 1 Coin for 2nd use, 2 Coins for 3rd use of the same action.  
- **Resource Substitution**: Pay 2 identical Resources to represent 1 of any other type.  
- **Unspent Action Points**: Draw 1 Resource card per unspent point (from face-up display first, then deck).  
- **Labourers**: Up to 2 per action (except Buy/Sell Sheep: max 1). Move when Labourer icon is uncovered on Income Board or Dike track.  

**Actions**:  
- **A. Build a Farm Expansion**  
  - Spend Action Points (tile’s top-left number) and Resources (top-right).  
  - Buildings require placing a Building Marker from Income Board.  
  - Terrain-specific tiles (Tree, Bush, Lake) must be placed on matching spaces.  
  - Brown edges on Buildings act as Fences.  
  - Replace tile from stack (Storm Surge tiles not replaced).  
  - **Labourer**: Pay 1 fewer Resource.  

- **B. Contribute to the Dike**  
  - Spend Action Points and matching Resources (same type as current Construction Yard Marker).  
  - Advance Resource Marker 1 space per Resource paid.  
  - When marker reaches end, build next Dike Segment (3 brown → 4 green → 6 light green).  
  - For each Resource paid, advance your Dike Point Marker 1 space.  
  - **Must invite 1 opponent to help**:  
    - If they help, you gain **+1 Dike space**.  
    - Helper may pay up to your number of Resources, advancing their marker 1 per Resource.  
  - **2-player variant**: Pay 1 Coin to reveal cards from deck equal to Resources spent; advance Resource Marker for each match.  
  - **Labourer**: Gain +1 Action Point.  

- **C. Build and/or Move Fences**  
  - Spend 1 Action Point to:  
    - Move 1 Fence to another gap, or  
    - Build 1 Fence from Income Board (pay 1 Resource; same type each time).  
  - Fenced Pasture spaces hold 1 Sheep each.  
  - **Labourer**: Gain +1 Action Point.  

- **D. Buy or Sell Sheep**  
  - Choose **Buy** or **Sell**, not both.  
  - **Buy**: Pay Action Points and Coins per Value Track to buy from one row.  
  - **Sell**: Gain Coins per Value Track by selling to one row.  
  - **Labourer**: -1 Coin to buy, +1 Coin to sell (max 1 Labourer).  

- **E. Draw Resource Cards**  
  - Draw 1 card per Action Point spent.  
  - Take from face-up display first, then deck.  
  - Refill display after.  
  - **Labourer**: Gain +1 Action Point.  

#### **Upkeep Phase**  
1. **Breeding**: Gain 1 Sheep for every 2 Sheep on your Farmyard Board (place if space available).  
2. **Income**: In turn order, gain all visible Income (Cards, Coins) from Income Board.  
3. **Retrieve Farmers**: Return all Farmers to supply.  
4. **Reset Sheep Market**: Return Sheep to original icons.  
5. **First Player**: Player furthest on Dike track (top on ties) takes First Player Marker.  
6. **Reveal Flood Card**: Reveal leftmost face-down Flood card and add Flood pieces.  
   - In final Upkeep, skip steps 3–5.  

#### **High Tide**  
Compare **Dike level** vs **Flood level**:  
- **Dike Holds** if:  
  - Dike level > Flood level, OR  
  - Equal level and Dike segments ≥ Flood pieces.  
- **Dike Breaks** otherwise.  

- **Dike Holds**:  
  - Each player gains 1 Coin per Dike point above the player with the fewest.  
  - Move Value Marker **1 right**.  

- **Dike Breaks**:  
  - Each player gains 1 Dike Breach Token per Dike point below the leader.  
  - Move Value Marker **1 left**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After the third High Tide, begin **Storm Surge Phase**:  
1. Score all buildings and features with **!** icon.  
2. **Check Dike status**:  
   - **Holds**: Discard all Dike Breach Tokens.  
   - **Breaks**: Discard 1 Sheep per Dike Breach Token.  
     - If short on Sheep, pay Coins equal to Sheep value (per Value Track).  
     - If short on Coins, lose 1 VP per missing Coin.  
3. Score:  
   - **Dike Points**: Dike points × current Value Track value.  
     - If past last space, add 20 to Dike points.  
   - **Sheep**: Number of Sheep × current Value Track value.  
   - **Expansion Tiles**: VP shown on shields.  
   - **Coins**: 1 VP per Coin.  
   - **Resource Cards**: 1 VP per 2 cards in hand.  
4. **Highest VP wins**. Tiebreaker: player furthest on Dike track (top on stack).
