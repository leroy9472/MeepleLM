# Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Maharaja, ruler of a vast Indian realm, embarks on a tour of seven cities. Players take on the roles of Rajas competing to impress the Maharaja by building palaces and establishing presence in cities. The goal is to be the first to build seven palaces or have the most palaces when the game ends after 10 rounds. Victory is determined by palace count, with gold and character card rank as tiebreakers.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Place Maharaja**: Put the Maharaja pawn on the starting location.  
2. **Place Character Cards**: Lay cards 1–6 face-up beside the board. Card 7 (Yogi) is for advanced play only.  
3. **Shuffle Governors**: Randomly place the 7 governor tiles face-up on the governor track (spaces above arrow).  
4. **Distribute Player Materials**: Each player takes:  
   - 1 architect (place on starting location)  
   - 7 palaces (in player color)  
   - 4 houses (in player color)  
   - 15 gold (e.g., one 10-value and one 5-value coin)  
   - 1 action disc  
5. **Unused Colors (if <5 players)**: For each unused color, place one outer palace of that color into each city’s garden.  
6. **Select Character Cards**:  
   - Youngest player chooses first; others select in clockwise order.  
   - Numbers determine turn order and tiebreakers.  
7. **Place Initial Houses**:  
   - In order of ascending character card number, each player places one of their 4 houses in any village (free of cost).  
   - Repeat this process for all 4 houses (each player places 1 house per round, 4 rounds total).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of five phases:

#### Phase 1: Move the Maharaja  
- Move the Maharaja to the city corresponding to the governor tile at the **bottom** of the governor track.

#### Phase 2: Move a Governor  
- Take the governor tile from the bottom of the track and place it **above the topmost** governor. This marks progression through the game (round counter).

#### Phase 3: Choose Actions  
- All players **simultaneously and secretly** select 2 actions using their action disc.  
- You may choose the same action twice.  
- Actions are not revealed until execution phase.

#### Phase 4: Execute Actions  
- Players take turns in **ascending order of character card number** (1 → 6).  
- On your turn:  
  - Reveal your two selected actions.  
  - Perform both actions in any order.  
  - You may interleave parts of actions (e.g., build one house, exchange character, then build palace).  
  - During your turn, you may move your architect freely as a free action.  
- After a player completes their turn, they do not act again this round.  
- If a player cannot or refuses to complete an action, **all other players receive 2 gold from the bank**.

#### Phase 5: Scoring  
- Score the city currently occupied by the Maharaja.  
- All players earn points based on presence:  
  - Architect in city: 1 point  
  - Each house in city: 1 point  
  - Each outer palace: 1 point  
  - Central palace: 3 points  
- Points determine gold rewards via scoring table (based on number of players).  
- Tiebreaker: Lower-numbered character card gets higher reward.  
- If only one player scores points, they receive **+5 gold** bonus.  
- Points are **not** cumulative toward final victory; only used for gold distribution.
