### 3. Setup

   - 2 Players: 16 tiles

4. **Lantern Card Supply**:  
   - 2 Players: 5 cards per color  
   - 3 Players: 7 cards per color  
   - 4 Players: 8 cards per color  
   Form 7 face-up stacks by color.  
5. **Dedication Tokens**:  
   - Sort into 3 stacks by type:  
     - Four of a Kind  
     - Three Pair  
     - Seven Unique  
   - Arrange each stack in descending order of value (highest on top).  
   - Adjust by player count:  
     - 4 Players: Use all tokens  
     - 3 Players: Remove all tokens with 4 dots  
     - 2 Players: Remove tokens with 3 or 4 dots  
   - Set aside 3 grey (generic) Dedication Tokens (worth 4 Honor each).

7. **Start Player**: The player facing red receives the Start Player Marker.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, actions must be taken in this order:

#### 1. Exchange a Lantern Card (Optional)  
- Once per turn, spend **2 Favor Tokens** to exchange 1 Lantern Card from your collection for 1 of any color from the supply.  
- Cannot be done on the first turn (no Favor Tokens available).  
- Must be done before any other actions.

#### 2. Make a Dedication (Optional)  
- Once per turn, return a valid set of Lantern Cards to the supply to claim the top Dedication Token of the corresponding type:  
  - **Four of a Kind**: 4 cards of the same color  
  - **Three Pair**: 2 cards each of 3 different colors (6 total)  
  - **Seven Unique**: 1 card of each of the 7 colors  
- If the stack is empty, take a **grey Dedication Token (4 Honor)** instead.  
- **Mandatory if holding >12 Lantern Cards**: Before placing a tile, you must make a dedication or discard down to 12.  
- Must be done before placing a tile.

#### 3. Place a Lake Tile (Mandatory)  
- Place one Lake Tile from your hand face up, adjacent to at least one existing tile (edge-to-edge, not diagonal).  
- **Matching Bonuses (Active Player)**:  
  - For each **matching color** on adjacent edges, gain 1 Lantern Card of that color (max 4).  
  - For each **Platform** on a tile involved in a color match (including the newly placed tile), gain 1 Favor Token.  
- **Orientation Bonuses (All Players)**:  
  - Starting with the active player and proceeding clockwise, each player gains 1 Lantern Card matching the color on the side of the newly placed tile they are facing.  
  - If a color is out of supply, that player receives nothing.  
- **Draw Phase**: After placement, if tiles remain in the draw pile, draw 1 Lake Tile to replenish hand to 3.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Hand Limit**: If you have **more than 12 Lantern Cards** at any point before placing a tile, you **must** either make a dedication or discard down to 12.  
- **Tile Placement**: Must be adjacent to at least one tile. Orientation matters for color distribution.  
- **Favor Tokens**:  
  - Unlimited supply. If supply runs out, use any substitute.  
  - Earned by matching adjacent tiles that have Platforms.  
- **Dedication Tokens**:  
  - Unlimited via grey tokens. If a stack is empty, replace it with a grey token (4 Honor). If claimed, replace again.  
- **Starting Tile**: The boat on the starting tile is **not** a Platform.  
- **Turn Order**: Always clockwise. Start Player Marker passes implicitly.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Condition**: Game ends when the last Lake Tile is placed.  
- **Final Turns**: After the last tile is placed, each player takes **one final turn** (in clockwise order, starting with the original start player) to:  
  - Exchange Lantern Cards (if possible)  
  - Make a Dedication (if possible)  
  - **No tile placement or drawing** (hands may be empty).  
- **Scoring**:  
  - Sum the Honor points from all Dedication Tokens claimed.  
- **Tiebreakers (in order)**:  
  1. Most Favor Tokens  
  2. Most Lantern Cards remaining  
  3. Shared victory (officially allowed)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Are Dedication Tokens unlimited?**  
  Yes. If a stack is empty, place a grey token (4 Honor) in its place. Replace it again if claimed.  
- **Are Favor Tokens unlimited?**  
  Yes. Use substitutes if supply runs out.  
- **How many Lake Tiles?**  
  36 total. The starting tile is included in this count.  
- **Is the boat on the starting tile a Platform?**  
  No. It does not trigger Favor Token gains.  
- **Does the Start Player Marker have other uses?**  
  No official function beyond turn order. Some players use it to mark the last-placed tile for reference.  
- **Does hand limit affect turn order?**  
  No. Discarding or dedicating to meet the 12-card limit is part of your turn and does not alter turn sequence.  
- **What if a Lantern Card color runs out?**  
  That color is temporarily unavailable. Players due that color receive nothing until cards are returned to supply.
