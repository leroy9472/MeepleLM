5. Shuffle 4 legendary directors and place face-down stack on designated space.  
6. Shuffle remaining production tiles and place face-down beside board.  
7. Shuffle 7 neutral screenplays (no studio number) and place face-up in a stack; only top card visible.  
8. Players select starting player; that player takes popcorn marker.  
9. Each player takes:  
   - 1 studio screen (used to hide tokens; not used in 2-player game)  
   - 3 screenplays matching their studio number  
   - 12 $1,000,000 tokens (10 tokens in 5-player game)  

Unused studio screens and screenplays are returned to box.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 4 rounds, each representing a production trimester. Each round consists of visiting 8 locations on the board in clockwise order, starting with the Legendary Director location.

**Before Each Round:**
- Reveal top legendary director tile and place on Legendary Director space.  
- Randomly place face-down tiles on both Party locations: number of tiles = number of players.  
- Randomly place face-up tiles on 5 City locations: 2 or 3 tiles per location as marked.  

**During Each Round:**
1. Visit each of the 8 locations in order.  
2. Resolve location (auction or party).  
3. Winner receives tiles and immediately allocates or discards them.  
4. If a screenplay is completed, immediately score it, draw a new screenplay (if available), and continue placing tiles.  
5. After all locations are resolved:  
   - After Rounds 1–3: Award one 5-point Best Movie trophy.  
   - After Round 4: Award 5 final trophies (10 points each).  

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Legendary Director & City Locations (Auction)
- First player (popcorn marker holder) begins bidding.  
- Players may bid any number of tokens (including 0) or pass.  
- Bids must exceed previous bid; players cannot bid more than they have.  
- Once a player passes, they are out of the auction.  
- Winner pays bid amount to center of board, takes all tiles, and receives popcorn marker (becomes next first player).  
- All other players split the paid tokens equally; any remainder stays in center for next auction.  

#### Party Locations (No Auction)
- All tiles are revealed face-up.  
- Players take 1 tile each in order based on total number of **actors and stars** on all their screenplays (completed or not).  
- Player with most actors/stars chooses first; then second most, etc.  
- Tiebreaker: player with popcorn marker, then clockwise order from first player.  
- Popcorn marker does **not** change after party locations.  

#### Placing Tiles
- Immediately after receiving tiles, player must place or discard each.  
- Tiles must be placed on matching icon spaces (e.g., director on director chair).  
- **Stacking**: Same-type tiles may be stacked on incomplete screenplays; only top tile counts.  
- **Blank spaces (empty circles)**: May be filled with actor, camera, music, or special effects tiles (not director or star). Only same type may be stacked.  
- **Directors**: One per screenplay; cannot go on blank spaces.  
- **Stars**: Only go in star space (bottom of screenplay); may be stacked; optional for completion.  

#### Contract Tiles (Jokers)
- Can replace any tile **except** stars.  
- Can be placed on blank spaces or over existing director/actor/camera/music/effects tiles on incomplete screenplays.  
- Once a contract is placed on a space, **only contracts** may be stacked on it thereafter.  

#### Completing a Screenplay
- A screenplay is complete when **all mandatory spaces** are filled.  
- Star space is **not mandatory**.  
- Once complete, no further tiles (including stars) may be added.  
- **Immediate Actions Upon Completion**:  
  1. **Score the screenplay**: Sum yellow stars on screenplay icon and on all topmost tiles.  
  2. **Place rating marker**: Use corresponding value; if “+” is available, take it first. If exact value is unavailable, use next lowest.  
  3. **Draw new screenplay**: Take top neutral screenplay if stack is not empty.  
  4. **Place remaining tiles**: Any unplaced tiles may now be used on new (or existing) screenplays.  

#### Trophies
- Only completed screenplays are eligible.  
- A screenplay may win multiple trophies.  

**During Game (5-point trophies):**  
- **Best Movie (after Rounds 1–3)**: Awarded to highest-rated completed screenplay. “+” breaks ties.  

**End of Game (10-point trophies):**  
- **Movie of the Year (3)**: Highest-rated screenplay in each genre (drama, action, comedy).  
- **Best Director**: Player with most star symbols on **director tiles** (not contracts) in completed screenplays. No award if tied.  
- **Worst Movie**: Completed screenplay with lowest rating.  

**First Movie (5-point, immediate):**  
- Awarded as soon as first screenplay in each genre (drama, action, comedy) is completed.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends after Round 4, once final trophies are awarded.

**Final Score =**  
- Sum of all **screenplay rating markers**  
- Plus sum of all **trophy values** (5 or 10 points)  
- Plus **number of remaining $1,000,000 tokens** (1 point each)  

**Tiebreaker**: Player with the highest-rated screenplay (highest marker, “+” counts higher) wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I save tiles for later?** No. Unplaced tiles must be discarded immediately.  
- **Can I place a star after completing a screenplay?** No. Star must be placed before final mandatory space is filled.  
- **What if I win tiles but can’t use them?** Discard unused tiles; they are removed from the game.  
- **What if no screenplay is completed by end of Round 1–3?** The Best Movie trophy is not awarded and is removed from the game.  
- **Can a contract tile be used as a director?** Yes, but it does **not** count toward Best Director trophy.  
- **Can I stack a contract on a director?** Yes, but then only contracts may be stacked on that space.  
- **What if I complete a screenplay during a party?** Score it immediately, draw new screenplay, and continue placing tiles before next player chooses.
