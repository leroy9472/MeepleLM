## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game is a solitaire and multiplayer strategy card game based on the acclaimed board game. Players take on the role of noble landowners developing their estates by acquiring and building projects, managing resources, and scoring points. The goal is to amass the most Victory Points (VP) over five rounds by completing sets of cards, selling goods, collecting bonuses, and managing animals and resources.

In solo mode, you compete against AARON (an automated opponent), whose performance is determined by a growing stack of cards and VP total. Victory is achieved only if your final VP exceeds AARON’s.
