## 13 DAYS: THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS – COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE MANUAL

### 1. Lore & Objective  
As President Kennedy (USA) or Premier Khrushchev (USSR), players reenact the 13-day Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The objective is to emerge with the most Prestige, representing historical legacy and diplomatic dominance. Prestige is earned by dominating battlegrounds and agenda objectives across military, political, and world opinion arenas. The game ends after three rounds and an Aftermath phase. The player with the most Prestige wins. In case of a tie, the player holding the Personal Letter wins.

Triggering nuclear war at any point results in an immediate loss. If both players trigger it simultaneously, both lose.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game is played over 3 rounds. Each round consists of 8 steps:

1. **Escalate DEFCON Tracks**  
   Move all DEFCON markers (both players) up one step on their respective tracks.

2. **Draw Agendas**  
   Shuffle the Agenda deck. Deal 3 cards to each player.  
   Each player places their 3 Flag counters on the corresponding battlegrounds/DEFCON tracks shown on their drawn cards.  
   Each player secretly selects one Agenda card to tuck face-down beneath the board (this is their hidden agenda).  
   Return the other two Agenda cards to the deck without revealing them.

3. **Strategy Cards & Initiative**  
   Each player draws 5 Strategy cards.  
   The player trailing in Prestige chooses who goes first. If tied, the USSR chooses.  
   Players alternate playing one Strategy card per turn for 4 turns (8 total plays).  
   A card can be played in two ways:  
   - **Command**: Use its Influence value to place or remove cubes (not both) on a single battleground. Max 5 cubes per player per battleground.  
     - Placing or removing more than one cube affects the connected DEFCON track: escalation/deflation = (number of cubes – 1).  
     - The player holding the Personal Letter may play it with a Command to add +1 Influence. Then pass it to the opponent.  
     - If playing an opponent’s card for Command, the opponent may trigger its Event before the Command action.  
   - **Event**: Play cards associated with your own superpower or UN to trigger their special effect.  
     - Events override normal rules unless they contradict the 5-cube limit.  
     - If the Event has a DEFCON icon, it affects DEFCON tracks normally when placing/removing cubes.  
     - If no DEFCON icon, DEFCON is unaffected.  
     - Opponent’s Event cards cannot be played as Events by you.

4. **Save Card for Aftermath**  
   After 4 turns, each player has 1 Strategy card left. Tuck it face-down beneath the board to form the Aftermath stack.

5. **World Opinion Bonus**  
   For each of the three World Opinion battlegrounds (Television, United Nations, Alliances), the player with the most Influence cubes triggers the effect (tie = no effect). Resolve in this order:  
   - **Television**: Escalate or deflate one of your DEFCON tracks by 1 step.  
   - **United Nations**: Take the Personal Letter card from your opponent (if they have it).  
   - **Alliances**: Draw the top Strategy card. Choose to add it to the Aftermath stack or discard it face-up.

6. **Resolve Agendas**  
   Reveal the two hidden Agenda cards. Retrieve Flag counters.  
   If an Agenda has a DEFCON icon, escalate all DEFCON markers in the DEFCON 2 area of that track by one step.  
   Resolve both Agendas simultaneously:  
   - **Battleground Agendas**: Prestige = difference in Influence cubes + bonus (0–2).  
     - Cuba (political/military) and Atlantic are connected. Each additional connected battleground you dominate adds +1 Prestige.  
   - **DEFCON Track Agendas**: Prestige = difference in DEFCON steps +1.  
   - **Personal Letter Agenda**: The player holding the Personal Letter gains 2 Prestige.  
   No player may lead by more than 5 Prestige. Awarded Prestige is applied immediately. Discard resolved Agenda cards.

7. **Check for Nuclear War**  
   A player loses instantly if:  
   - Any of their DEFCON markers is in the DEFCON 1 area  
   - All three of their DEFCON markers are in the DEFCON 2 area  
   These conditions are checked only at this step, but can be violated earlier in the round.

8. **Advance Round Marker**  
   Move the Round marker forward. If it reaches the Aftermath phase, proceed to endgame.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Influence Cubes  
- Limited resource (17 per player).  
- Can be placed or removed via Command or Events.  
- Max 5 per player per battleground.  
- Removed cubes return to stock.  
- Cannot move cubes directly unless an Event allows it (e.g., Wave and Smile).

#### DEFCON Tracks  
- Three tracks: Military, Political, World Opinion.  
- Each has steps from 5 (calm) to 1 (nuclear war).  
- Markers escalate/deflate based on cube placement/removal:  
  - Effect = (number of cubes placed/removed – 1) per battleground.  
- DEFCON markers cannot go beyond track limits.

#### Personal Letter  
- Starts with US player.  
- Can be transferred via World Opinion (UN effect) or by playing it with a Command.  
- Grants +1 Influence when used in Command.  
- Breaks Prestige ties at game end.

#### Initiative  
- Determined by Prestige: trailing player chooses who goes first.  
- If tied, USSR chooses.

#### Opponent’s Strategy Cards  
- Can be played for Command.  
- When played, opponent may trigger the Event first.  
- Cannot be played as Events by you.

#### Aftermath  
- After 3 rounds, reveal the Aftermath stack (6–9 cards).  
- Discard all UN cards.  
- Count total Command value (Influence cubes) on US and USSR cards.  
- Player with higher total gains +2 Prestige. Tie = no award.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
At the end of Round 3:  
1. Resolve Aftermath:  
   - Reveal saved cards.  
   - Count Command values on US/USSR cards only.  
   - Higher total gains +2 Prestige.  
2. Compare Prestige:  
   - Higher Prestige wins.  
   - Tie: Player holding the Personal Letter wins.  
   - If both triggered nuclear war, both lose.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I play 0 cubes with a "Command up to X" card?**  
A: Yes. "Up to" includes 0.

**Q: Do Events without DEFCON icons affect DEFCON?**  
A: No. Only Events with DEFCON icons affect DEFCON tracks.

**Q: Can I move cubes directly between battlegrounds?**  
A: Only if an Event allows it (e.g., Wave and Smile). Otherwise, remove then place.

**Q: Who dominates a DEFCON track?**  
A: The player whose marker is higher (more escalated).

A: No. They may choose to trigger it or not.

**Q: Can I play the Personal Letter without a Strategy card?**  
A: No. It must be played alongside a Strategy card used for Command.

A: Yes. Agendas award Prestige to whoever dominates, regardless of who chose it.

**Q: What if two players tie on an Agenda?**  
A: No Prestige is awarded for that Agenda.

**Q: Can DEFCON markers exceed the track limits?**  
A: No. They stop at the top (step 1) or bottom (step 5).
