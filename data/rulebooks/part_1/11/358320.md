4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Travel Phase**:  
   - Players decide which location to fly to next using the Flight Board.  
   - Cross off visited locations on the world map only when instructed; circle them when visited.  
   - Movement may trigger Event or Quest Cards based on location number.  

2. **Action Phase**:  
   - Players take turns performing actions (e.g., explore, rest, craft, trade, use abilities).  
   - Use Adventure Cards and Resources to overcome challenges.  
   - Manage Stamina and Power using tokens.  

3. **Event/Quest Resolution**:  
   - Draw and resolve Event or Quest Cards based on location.  
   - Level 1–3 Event Cards introduce environmental, social, or survival challenges.  
   - Quest Cards may require resource collection, combat, or skill checks.  

4. **Combat Phase (if triggered)**:  
   - Set up enemies using Enemy Cards and Combat Deck Board.  
   - Use Combat Cards (e.g., Pistol, Disorient, Flank) and Combat Die.  
   - Apply Damage, Status, and Enemy Buffs as needed.  
   - Synergy Tokens may be spent for coordinated attacks.  

5. **End of Round**:  
   - Replenish limited resources.  
   - Record progress in the Journey Log.  
   - Pass the Active Player Token clockwise.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **World Map Navigation**: Locations are numbered; players must follow narrative or card instructions to unlock or cross off locations. Circling = visited, crossing off = completed or blocked.  
- **Resource Management**: Common and quest resources are used to survive, craft, or complete quests.  
- **Card-Based Actions**: Players use Adventure and Ability Cards to perform actions or modify outcomes.  
- **Combat System**:  
  - Players play Combat Cards from hand.  
  - Roll the Combat Die to determine hit success or effect.  
  - Enemy Cards specify health, damage, and behaviors.  
  - Status Tokens (e.g., Weakened, Frightened) affect performance.  
- **Stamina & Power**: Stamina Tokens track exhaustion; Power Tokens fuel special abilities.  
- **Ability System**: Ability Cards grant passive or active bonuses (e.g., Dodge, Lucky, Herbalist). Some are fate-based (e.g., Aim (Fate 5)).  
- **Progression**: Completing quests unlocks new locations, cards, or story beats in the Storybook.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is no traditional scoring system.  
- The game ends when the group completes the final quest or reaches a story conclusion as defined in the Storybook or Quest Cards.  
- Success is measured by:  
  - Number of completed Quest Cards.  
  - Survival of all characters.  
  - Completion of personal character arcs (tracked in Journey Log).  
  - Achievement Sheet tracks milestones (e.g., "Defeat Helthark", "Discover 10 Locations").  
- The Journey Log records narrative decisions and outcomes.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I revisit a circled location?**  
  Yes, unless the rules or a card effect specifically blocks it.  
- **What happens when I draw an Orfash Curse Card?**  
  Resolve its effect immediately; these are narrative or mechanical penalties tied to the Ofash Cultists questline.  
- **Can I use multiple Ability Cards at once?**  
  Yes, if their effects are compatible and not restricted by timing.  
- **What does the Bonus Time Token do?**  
  Likely grants an extra action or reroll; exact use depends on context or card reference.  
- **How are Enemy Buff Cards applied?**  
  Drawn or assigned to enemies during combat to increase difficulty (e.g., Deadly adds damage, Tenacious prevents knockdown).  
- **What is the Pocket Watch for?**  
  Likely a tracking tool for time-based events or turn order modifiers.
