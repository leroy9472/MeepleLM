### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds. Each round consists of one turn per player, starting with the Start Player and continuing clockwise.

Each turn has two phases:

#### Phase A: Placing the Trader Tower  
- The current player (tower player) rolls both dice.  
- The red and blue die results form coordinates (e.g., red=3, blue=4 → space 3/4).  
- Place all 5 tower discs as a stack on that space.  
- If the space is the Market (4/4, 4/5, 5/4, 5/5), advance the Round marker one space.  

#### Phase B: Moving the Trader Tower  
- The tower moves orthogonally only (no diagonals).  
- From its current field, the tower may move to an adjacent field.  
- On each move, leave 1 disc behind in the field just exited.  
- The tower can move up to 4 times (visiting up to 5 fields total, including start).  
- A field cannot be revisited.  
- After each placement (including initial), the tower player may offer the building’s action.  

#### Offering and Negotiating Actions  
- When the tower lands on a building, the action becomes available.  
- All players (including tower player) may take only **one action per turn**, unless using a special card.  
- The tower player may:  
  - Take the action themselves.  
  - Accept an offer from another player to perform the action.  
- If no one pays for the action, it expires.  
- Binding deals can be made for:  
  - Immediate action at current building.  
  - Future action at a neighboring building (finalized only when adjacent).  
- Offers may include:  
  - Money (in 5-ducat increments).  
  - Goods: wares, cards, special tokens, owner markers.  
  - Rights to the product of the action.  
- Illegal: Promises, rule changes, future actions, intangible rights.  
- The tower player must accept an offer if they cannot or will not take the action.  

#### Building Actions  
Available only when the tower places a disc on the building.

- **Warehouses (4)**: Take 1 of each of 2 wares shown. If a ware is unavailable, take what is possible. Action still counts as taken.  
- **Guild Hall**: Take 1 Large Order card.  
- **City Hall**: Take 2 Small Order cards.  
- **Post Office**: Take 2 Message cards.  
- **Cathedral**: Take 2 owner markers of your color.  
- **Special Token Buildings (6)**: Take 1 special token from beside the building.  
  - Includes: Coach House ("Any Start Space"), Park ("1 Further Action"), Harbour ("1 of Any Ware"), Tavern/Restaurant ("1:1 Trade"), Palace ("1 Building Action")  
- **Villas (4)**: Choose **one**:
  - Take the top Privilege card into hand, OR  
  - Fulfill a Large Order (if you have the required wares).  
- **Street Fields**: No action. Used only for owner marker placement.  
- **Market**: No action. If tower starts here (via roll), advance Round marker.  

#### Fulfilling Orders and Messages  
- **Large Order**:  
  - Must be fulfilled at the named Villa on the card.  
  - Pay 3 required wares to supply.  
  - Receive 100 ducats and choose 1 special card.  
  - Card goes face-up under stack.  
- **Small Order**:  
  - Can be delivered **in addition** to a building action.  
  - Deliver required good to supply.  
  - Receive 40 ducats.  
  - Can be played even if building action is not available.  
  - Only 1 per turn.  
- **Message**:  
  - Deliver by visiting both buildings listed on the card **in the same turn**.  
  - Order of visit doesn’t matter.  
  - No need to take actions at either building.  
  - Discard card, receive 30 ducats.  
  - Multiple messages can be delivered per turn.  

#### Special Tokens (Play by returning to supply)  
- **"Any Start Space" (wheel)**: Replace dice roll; place tower anywhere. If placed in Market, advance Round marker.  
- **"1 Further Action" (tree)**: Take one additional building action this turn. Cannot repeat same building. Tower must have moved between actions.  
- **"1 of Any Ware" (crate)**: Take any 1 ware from supply. Can be played before, during, or after an action. Not during negotiations or other players’ turns.  
- **"1:1 Trade"**: Trade any 1 good from supply for any 1 good from your play area. Return card to supply.  
- **"1 Building Action" (building)**: Take an action at any building where you have an owner marker.  
  - Building need not be visited by tower.  
  - Does not prevent others from using it.  
  - Cannot be used to deliver a Small Order at current building.  

#### Placing Owner Markers  
After the tower player finishes moving:  
1. Tower player begins.  
2. Players take turns clockwise.  
3. On your turn:  
   - Choose a street space with a tower disc.  
   - Place **one** owner marker on **any building orthogonally adjacent** to that street.  
   - Remove the tower disc from that street space.  
4. To remove an opponent’s marker:  
   - Pay 1 of your own markers (sacrifice).  
   - Opponent’s marker returns to supply.  
   - You may then place 1 of your markers on that building (optional).  
5. You may place multiple markers over time, but only one per turn.  
6. You may not place if no valid building is accessible via a tower-occupied street.  

#### Owner Marker Benefits  
- Whenever **any player** takes an action in a building where you have an owner marker, you receive 10 ducats from the bank.  
- You do **not** receive ducats when you take the action in your own building.  
- At game end, receive 10 ducats per owner marker **on the board**.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Turn Order**: Clockwise; each player is tower player once per round.  
- **Movement**: Orthogonal only; max 5 fields; no repeats; leave disc behind.  
- **Actions**: One per player per turn, unless modified by special cards.  
- **Negotiation**: Only between tower player and one opponent. Binding once finalized.  
- **Goods**: Include wares, cards, special tokens, owner markers. Money is not a good.  
- **Timing of Special Cards**: Must be played **before, during, or after** your action. Not during negotiations or other players’ turns.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when the Round marker reaches the space showing the number of players. The game ends **after** the player to the right of the Start Player completes their turn. All players have equal turns.

Final scoring:
1. **Privilege Cards**:  
   - Each card lists one building.  
   - Score chains of adjacent buildings:  
     - 2 adjacent: 20 ducats  
     - 3 adjacent: 40 ducats  
     - 4 adjacent: 70 ducats  
     - (i.e., n adjacent buildings = 10 × n² ducats)  
   - Isolated cards: 10 ducats each.  
2. **Owner Markers**:  
   - 10 ducats each for markers **on buildings**.  
   - Markers in supply do not count.  
3. **Money**: Each ducat = 1 point.  
4. **Unused Goods**: Have no point value.  

**Final Score = Ducats (money + earned) + Privilege points + Owner marker points**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I deliver a Small Order without taking the building action?**  
  Yes. You can deliver a Small Order at any building, even if you didn’t take its action, as long as you are taking an action somewhere.  

- **Can I use "1 Building Action" to repeat a building’s action this turn?**  
  Yes. Unlike "1 Further Action", this allows repeating a building’s action, even if already used.  

- **Can I negotiate to move the tower to a street?**  
  Yes. Useful for enabling owner marker placement.  

- **Can I offer goods I will receive from the action?**  
  Yes. The product of the action can be part of the negotiated deal.  

- **Can I use a special card on the same turn I acquire it?**  
  Yes, as long as it's during or after an action.  

- **What happens if a card stack runs out?**  
  When a stack is exhausted, shuffle the face-up discard pile and place it face-down.  

- **Tiebreaker**:  
  - Most ducats wins.  
  - Tie: Player with most unused goods (wares, cards, markers) wins.
