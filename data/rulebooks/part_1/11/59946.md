1. **Choose an Adventure**: Select one from the Adventure Book and follow its specific setup instructions.
2. **Prepare Decks**: Shuffle the Monster, Encounter, and Treasure decks separately.

4. **Draw Starting Item**: Each player draws Treasure cards, discarding non-Items until they draw one. Place the Item faceup in front of them.

7. **Determine First Player**: Randomly or mutually decide who goes first. Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each player’s turn consists of three phases:

#### 1. Hero Phase
- **At 0 HP**: If a hero has 0 HP, they must use a Healing Surge token at the start of their turn. If none are available, the heroes lose.
- **Choose One Action**:
  - Move, then Attack (or attempt to disable a trap)
  - Attack (or attempt to disable a trap), then Move
  - Make two Moves

#### 2. Exploration Phase
- Triggered **only** if the hero is on a space adjacent to an unexplored edge of a tile.
- **Draw and Place Tile**:
  - Draw a dungeon tile and place it so the triangle points toward the hero’s tile.
- **Add Monster**:
  - Draw a Monster card. If the player already controls that monster type, discard and draw again.
  - Place the monster figure on the bone pile (skull icon) of the new tile.
  - Place the Monster card faceup in front of the player (now under their control).
- After placing the tile, the hero may continue moving or attacking if action(s) remain.

#### 3. Villain Phase
- **Draw Encounter Card** if:
  - No tile was placed this turn, OR
  - A tile with a **black triangle** was placed.
- **Cancel Encounter (Optional)**: Spend 5 XP (discard Monster/Villain cards totaling 5 XP) to cancel the Encounter card and ignore its effect.
- **Resolve Encounter Card** (if not canceled):
  - **Event**: Resolve once and discard.
  - **Environment**: Apply effect to all players. Replace any existing Environment card.
  - **Trap**: Place the trap marker on the active hero’s tile. If a trap already exists there, discard this card and draw another Encounter card. The Trap card is placed in front of the drawing player.
- **Activate Villain(s)**: If in play, activate each Villain once, following their tactics.
- **Activate Controlled Monsters and Traps**: In the order they were acquired, activate each Monster and Trap the player controls. Follow the Monster’s tactics script, activating all copies of the same monster type.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Movement
- Heroes move a number of **squares** equal to their Speed (shown on Hero card).
- Diagonal movement is allowed unless blocked by walls.
- Cannot move through walls or into a square occupied by a monster.
- Can move through another hero’s square but cannot end movement there.
- Monsters move by **tiles** and cannot move diagonally.
- A large monster (occupying multiple squares) counts as being on every tile its base touches.

#### Status Conditions
- **Slowed**: Speed reduced to 2. Mark with Slowed token.
- **Immobilized**: Speed reduced to 0. Mark with Immobilized token.
- **Dazed**: May move or attack, but not both.
- **Paralyzed**: Cannot move, attack, or use powers. Takes +1 damage from attacks. Ends after the phase.
- **Poisoned**: At the end of the hero’s turn, take 1 damage if result > 10 on a d20 roll.
- **Stunned**: –4 to Armor Class and automatically misses attacks.
- **Weakened**: –4 to attack rolls.
- All conditions end at the end of the hero’s next turn unless otherwise specified.

#### Powers
- **At-Will Powers**: Can be used every turn. Not flipped.
- **Daily Powers**: Flipped face-down after use. Cannot be reused until flipped back (via item or leveling).
- **Utility Powers**: Flipped after use. Cannot be reused unless flipped back.
- Powers may be used with or without movement, depending on action choice.

#### Combat
- To attack, choose a target within range and line of effect (no wall blocking).
- Roll 1d20, add Attack Bonus from power and modifiers.
- If total ≥ target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits.
- Deal damage as listed. Apply modifiers.
- **Critical Hit**: Rolling a natural 20 deals +1 damage.
- **Critical Miss**: Rolling a natural 1 is an automatic miss and failure (no “miss” effect applies).

#### Defeating Monsters
- When a monster reaches 0 HP:
  - Remove its figure.
  - The player who delivered the killing blow draws **one** Treasure card.
  - The player who controls the monster discards its Monster card to the **Experience Pool**.
    - If multiple players control it, the attacker discards if they control it; otherwise, go clockwise to find the first controller.

#### Defeating Heroes
- At 0 HP, lay the hero figure on its side.
- Cannot move, attack, or use powers. Ignored by monsters.
- Can still be affected by healing and other effects.
- At the start of their next turn, **must** spend a Healing Surge to recover HP equal to their Surge Value.
- If no Healing Surges remain, the heroes lose.

#### Traps
- Placed via Encounter card. Marker goes on the active hero’s tile.
- If tile already has a trap, discard the card and draw another Encounter.
- Controlled by the player who drew it.
- Activates during Villain Phase like a monster.
- A hero on the same tile may attempt to disable it:
  - Roll d20 ≥ number on Trap card → disable and discard trap.
- No action cost.

#### Experience Points (XP)
- Monster cards list their XP value.
- Villains are worth XP equal to their level.
- XP is stored in the shared Experience Pool (defeated Monster/Villain cards).
- Used for:
  - Canceling Encounter cards (cost: 5 XP)
  - Leveling up (cost: 5 XP)

#### Leveling Up
- Triggered when a hero rolls a **natural 20** on an attack or trap-disabling roll.
- May spend 5 XP to level up immediately.
- Flip Hero card to 2nd level side:
  - Increased HP (do not remove existing damage)
  - Increased AC
  - Increased Surge Value
  - Choose a new Daily Power
  - Gain ability to make **critical attacks** (+1 damage on natural 20)
- The **Level Up** Treasure card also allows leveling without rolling a 20.

#### Treasure Cards
- Draw one per turn maximum, typically when defeating a monster.
- Types:
  - **Items**: Provide lasting benefits. Can be kept or given to adjacent hero.
  - **Blessings**: Play immediately. Affect all heroes. Last until end of next turn, then discard.
  - **Fortunes**: Play immediately for one-time benefit. Discard after.
  - **Level Up**: Allows hero to level up (see above).

### 6. Scoring & End Game

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use more than one power per turn?**  
  Yes, if you have actions remaining. But you may not make two attacks in one turn unless a power allows it.

- **Can I disable a trap instead of attacking?**  
  Yes. This replaces an attack action. Roll d20 ≥ number on trap card.

- **What happens if I draw a Monster I already control?**  
  Discard it and draw another until you get a new type.

- **Can I use a Utility power during another player’s turn?**  
  Only if the card specifies it can be used as a reaction or outside your turn.

- **Do I draw a Treasure card for each monster defeated in a turn?**  
  No. Only **one** Treasure card per turn, regardless of how many monsters are defeated.

- **Can I cancel an Environment card with XP?**  
  Yes, but the existing Environment card remains in play. Only the new one is canceled.

- **Can monsters move diagonally?**  
  No. Monsters move by tiles and cannot move diagonally.

- **Can I continue moving after placing a tile?**  
  Yes. If you have movement left, you may move onto the new tile or away.

- **Can I attack after placing a tile?**  
  Yes, if your action allows an attack after moving.
