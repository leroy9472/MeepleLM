## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Ca$h'n Guns is a bluffing and negotiation game set in a world of backstabbing mobsters dividing loot after a heist. Players use foam guns to threaten each other in a tense mix of bluffs ("Click!") and real shots ("Bang!"). The goal is to survive and collect the most loot without being shot or outmaneuvered.

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player receives:  
   - 5 "Click!" cards  
   - 3 "Bang!" cards  
2. Shuffle loot cards and create **8 piles of 8 cards** each.  
3. Reveal the top card of each pile + 1 "Desk" card → form the initial loot display (8 loot cards + 1 special card).  
4. Place Godfather token beside starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in 7 phases:

#### 1. Loot!  
- Flip 8 loot cards and the Desk card face up.  

#### 2. Choose Bang! or Click!  
- Each player secretly selects one card from their hand: "Bang!" or "Click!"  
- Place chosen card face down in front of them.  

#### 3. Hold-Up  
- All players count aloud: “1, 2, 3”  
- On “3”, everyone simultaneously points their foam gun at a target.  

#### 4. Godfather’s Privilege  
- The Godfather may **order one player to change their target**.  
- This happens before courage is revealed.  

#### 5. Courage  
- Count “1, 2, 3” again.  
- Each player chooses:  
  - **Lie down** (surrender, avoid damage)  
  - **Stay standing** (risk damage for loot)  
- If your **target lies down**, you must discard your bullet (Bang!) **face down**.  

#### 6. Card Effects  
- Reveal all played cards:  
  - **Click!**: No effect  
  - **Bang!**: If your target stayed standing → they take a **wound** and lie down.  

#### 7. Loot Sharing  
- Starting with the Godfather, players **who are still standing** take one loot card each in clockwise order.  
- The Godfather takes an **extra share** (represented by flipping their token).  
- After distribution, pass the Godfather token to the next eligible player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Wounds  
- Taking a hit from a "Bang!" while standing = 1 wound.  
- A player with **2 wounds** is **eliminated** (dead) for the remainder of the game.  

#### Loot Cards & Powers  
Some loot cards grant special powers. Examples:  
- **Loader**: Take a "Bang!" from discard pile, but **only if** you can discard a "Click!" card. If no "Click!" in hand, effect fails.  
- **The Dictator**: Prevent one player from taking a specific type of loot **this turn only**.  
- **The Professional**: Steal a **random** loot card from another player.  
- **The Smart**: Discard a bullet **face down** (as per standard rules).  
- **The Junk Dealer**: Exchange a visible loot card with a random card from any unrevealed loot pile.  
- **The Blackmailer**: Force the Godfather to give you a loot card — **Godfather chooses which one**.  

#### Expansions  

##### More Cash’n More Guns  
- **Imitator (Surprise Card)**: Gain another player’s power card **in addition** to your own. If both grant special guns, you may replace your current gun or wait.  
- **Small Gun (Surprise Card)**: Grants a second gun that fires automatically at a different target.  
  - Keep it **only if it does no damage**.  
  - If it hits (even if main gun misses), it is discarded.  
- **Fake Painting**: Activate by **deducting $20,000** from your total loot value (not physical cards).  

##### Team Spirit  
- **Shadow Trade**: Players trade cards **face down**; discussion allowed but risky.  
- **Swap in the Shadow**: You may trade with a dead teammate — they choose the card as if alive.  
- **Desert Sparrow**: If targeted by Godfather’s Privilege, **Godfather’s order takes precedence**. Sparrow’s power applies to **final target only**.  
- **Mercenaries Module**:  
  - Cards placed under envelope tokens are **lost** and do not count toward bonuses.  
  - **Diamond Bonus**: Only counts cards in players’ possession; cards under envelopes ignored.  
  - **Fake Double Diamonds**: Worthless; not useful under diamond envelope.  
  - **Counterfeit Notes**: Only counted if **last Godfather** decides to count them.  
  - **Paintings**: Value based on **collection size under the envelope**.  
  - **Fake Painting under envelope**: Can be activated by **paying $20,000** — only when placed under mercenary tile. **Team members may contribute**.  
  - **Key & Case**: If either or both are under envelopes → both worth **$0**.  
- **Flash Bang (Surprise Card)**:  
  - May target **teammates**.  
  - Observer may give **true or misleading hints** (e.g., “You’re aiming at your teammate”), but **cannot falsely claim misalignment**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when **all loot cards are distributed**.  
- Players total the **monetary value** of their loot.  
- **Diamonds**: Most diamonds = Diamond Bonus (value specified on token).  
- **Paintings**: Score based on set size (larger collections = higher value).  
- **Fake Painting**: Worth $0 unless activated by paying $20,000.  
- Highest total wins. Ties broken by fewest wounds.  

#### Special Case: No One Takes Loot  
- If **no one is standing** during loot phase:  
  - Loot cards **remain** for next round.  
  - **Next round adds 8 new cards** → up to 16 cards to split.  
  - Godfather **does not change**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Loader with no Clicks?** → Cannot gain Bang; effect fails.  
- **The Dictator blocking**: Only applies **this turn**, not permanently.  
- **Blocked player with no legal loot?** → Skips turn, can take loot next round.  
- **Dead players**: Cannot act, but may still be involved in trades (choose own card).  
- **Godfather token flip**: Represents extra loot share; flip back after next distribution.  
- **Fake Painting activation**: Deduct $20,000 from total — no need to discard physical cards.
