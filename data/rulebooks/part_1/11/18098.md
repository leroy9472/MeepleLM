# Napoleon’s Triumph – Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Napoleon’s Triumph simulates the 1805 Battle of Austerlitz, where Napoleon lured the Allied army into attacking, then counterattacked decisively. The game captures this historical trap through asymmetric victory conditions and reinforcement timing.

**Objective:** A player wins by either:
- Inflicting enough losses to demoralize the enemy (decisive victory), or
- Controlling key objective locales at game end (marginal victory).

## 2. Components
- 140 wooden playing pieces (units)
- 18 metal leader pieces (commanders)
- 15 wooden markers (Time Track, Morale Track, Command Tracks)
- 2 game boards
- 2 sheets of stickers (for commanders)
- 2 copies of rules booklet

Units are blue (French) or red (Allied) and represent:
- Infantry (1–3 strength)
- Cavalry (1–2 strength)
- Artillery (1 strength)
- Guard Infantry (3 strength, elite)
- Heavy Cavalry (3 strength, elite)

## 3. Setup
(1) Choose scenario:  
- **2 December Scenario:** All Allied pieces start on map. Estimated time: 2 hours.  
- **1 December Scenario:** Two Allied corps start on map; others enter as reinforcements. Estimated time: 3 hours.

(2) Assign sides.

(3) Place markers:  
- Time Track: Black marker at first round.  
- Morale Track: Red (Allied) and blue (French) markers at starting morale.  
- Command Tracks: Black markers for tracking command usage.

(4) Organize armies into corps:  
- Each corps = 1 commander + 1–8 units.  
- Units assigned face-down to commanders.  
- Minimum units per commander specified on Army Display.  
- Allied player assigns all corps.  
- French player assigns on-map corps (Bernadotte’s and Davout’s start off-map as reinforcements).

(5) Place corps:  
- Allied and French on-map corps placed in setup locale matching commander’s name.  
- Units may be in reserve or blocking any approach, but all must be in same position.

(6) French detachments:  
- French player may detach up to 6 units from on-map commanders.  
- Detached units may move up to 2 locales from original commander.  
- Cannot be placed in or adjacent to red, green, or black objective locales.

(7) French fixed battery:  
- French player turns one artillery unit face-up and names it fixed battery.  
- If in reserve, must reposition to block an approach in setup locale.  
- Cannot move during game.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
- Game proceeds in rounds (spaces on Time Track).
- Each round:  
  1. **Allied Turn:** Allied player executes up to 5 corps commands and 3 independent commands.  
  2. **French Turn:** French player executes any number of corps commands and up to 4 independent commands.  
  3. **End of Turn:** Both players may perform out-of-sight "shuffles" of units in same position to maintain secrecy.  
  4. **Advance Time Track.**

**Night Round (1 December Scenario only):**  
- No attacks allowed.  
- Each side regains half (rounded down) of morale losses, up to 4 points.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Corps
- A corps is 1 commander + 1–8 units.  
- All units in a corps must be in the same position.  
- A commander cannot detach its last unit. If all units are eliminated, the commander is eliminated.  
- Corps can move through a locale with capacity less than corps size if moving by road and not ending there.

### Commands
Players execute commands during their turn. One command must finish before starting another.

**Corps Commands (issued by commander):**  
- **Corps Move:** Move commander and all or part of corps. Units may be detached before move.  
- **Detach Move:** Detach 1+ units from corps and move them together. Corps does not move. Units cannot move by road.  
- **Attach:** Attach one unit (detached or from another corps) to the corps. Both unit and commander must be in same position.

**Independent Commands (for detached units):**  
- **Unit Move:** Move one detached unit. If attached, it may be detached as part of the command.

**Command Limits:**  
- Allied: 5 corps commands, 3 independent commands per turn.  
- French: Unlimited corps commands, 4 independent commands per turn.  
- Each unit may be moved only once per turn.

**Command Tracking:** Opponent places marker on Command Track for each command used.

### Movement
- Movement occurs via commands.  
- Multiple pieces in a single command move together.  
- Pieces may not cross or block impassable approaches.

**From Reserve:**  
- To block an approach in same locale.  
- To reserve in adjacent locale.

**From Approach:**  
- To reserve in same locale.  
- To reserve in adjacent locale across that approach.

**Road Movement:**  
- Must start in reserve.  
- Along main road: up to 3 locales.  
- Along local or mixed roads: up to 2 locales.  
- Must end in reserve, unless all moving units are cavalry. Cavalry may end blocking an approach if road crosses it.  
- Units briefly turned face-up to confirm cavalry status.

**Corps Road Movement (2+ units):**  
- Cannot enter locale if reserve contains units that moved in earlier that turn.  
- After entering, no other units may move into or through that reserve for the rest of the turn.  
- Must stop if entering locale adjacent to one containing enemy corps of 2+ units.

**Reinforcements:**  
- Enter via road movement on reinforcement entry locales (blue for French, red for Allied).  
- Must use command (Unit Move or Corps Move).  
- Cannot use enemy-occupied entry locale.  
- French reinforcements: May receive two move commands on entry turn (first must be road move).

### Attacks
An attack occurs when pieces attempt to move into an enemy-occupied locale.

**Attack Procedure:**

1. **Attack Threat:** Attacker names attack approach. Does not reveal attacking pieces or command.

2. **Retreat Option:** Defender chooses:
   - **Retreat:** All defending pieces in locale retreat (see Retreat rules). Attacker moves in.
   - **Defend:** Names defending pieces from:
     - All units blocking defense approach (must all be named).
     - Any or all units in defense reserve (with restrictions: max 1 detached unit, no prior defense on other approach, no prior retreat after combat).

3. **Feint Option:** Attacker may declare feint:
   - If declared, attack ends here. Attacking pieces do not enter defense locale.
   - If defending pieces are in reserve, defender must move at least one to block defense approach.
   - Road attacks by cavalry must be feints.

4. **Defense Declaration:** Defender names 0–2 defense leading units from defending pieces:
   - Wide approach: 0–2 units. Narrow: 0–1.
   - Units in reserve: Cannot be paired unless same type and same corps. Strength 1 units cannot lead.

5. **Attack Declaration:** Attacker names:
   - Command(s) used.
   - Attack width (wide or narrow; if narrow, chooses which defense leading unit to engage if two present).
   - Attack leading units from attacking pieces:
     - Infantry/cavalry: Strength 2 or 3. Cannot lead if strength 1.
     - Artillery: Must be blocking attack approach. Cannot lead via Corps Move.
     - Cavalry cannot lead if defense approach obstructed.
     - Units cannot be paired unless same type.

6. **Initial Result:**  
   - Add strengths of attack leading units.  
   - Subtract 1 if attack leading units are infantry and defenders are blocking.  
   - Subtract 1 if terrain penalty matches attack leading unit type and defenders are blocking.  
   - Unless attack leading units are artillery, subtract total strength of defense leading units.

   **Winner:**  
   - >0: Attacker wins.  
   - <0: Defender wins.  
   - =0: Defender wins if blocking; otherwise, side with more units wins (French win ties).

7. **Counter-Attack:** If attack leading units are not artillery, defender may counter-attack with 1–2 units:
   - Must not be leading units.
   - Two units only if same type and same corps.
   - Infantry only if attacker won initial result. Cavalry always may.
   - Artillery cannot counter-attack.
   - Each counter-attacking unit takes immediate 1-strength loss.

8. **Final Result:** Subtract reduced strength of counter-attacking units from initial result. Reapply winner tests.

9. **Attacker Losses:**  
   - If artillery-led: No losses.  
   - Otherwise: 1 loss per defense leading unit + number of points final result is below 0.  
   - Apply to leading units first (evenly, defender chooses odd); excess to other attacking units (attacker chooses).

10. **Defender Losses:**  
   - 1 per cavalry/infantry attack leading unit + number of points final result is above 0 – 1 per defense leading artillery unit.  
   - Apply to leading infantry/cavalry first (evenly, attacker chooses odd); then counter-attacking units (evenly, attacker chooses odd); then other defending units (defender chooses).

11. **Completion:**  
   - **Artillery-led:** No movement. All pieces stay.  
   - **Attacker wins (non-artillery):** Defenders retreat. Attackers move to defense reserve.  
   - **Defender wins:** Attackers blocking approach withdraw to attack reserve. All attacking units detached from corps except one per corps (attacker chooses). If defenders were in reserve, defender must move at least one to approach.

After attack, all face-up units turned face-down.

**Combined Attacks:**  
- Two or more Corps Moves may combine if same position and same attack approach.  
- Two Unit Moves may combine if both artillery and blocking same attack approach.

**Post-Attack Rules:**  
- If attack led by artillery, second non-artillery attack allowed across same approach same turn (different pieces).  
- If feint or attacker loss, no further attack across that approach.  
- If attacker wins (non-artillery/artillery), only attacking pieces may enter defense locale that turn.

### Retreats
- Occurs when defenders lose and attack not led by artillery.
- All defending pieces in locale must retreat.
- Artillery eliminated.
- Infantry/cavalry on non-defense approaches lose 1 strength (narrow) or 2 (wide). Retreating player chooses units.
- Infantry in reserve (not defending) lose 1 (narrow defense) or 2 (wide). Cavalry in reserve take no loss.
- Retreat to adjacent locale: not attack locale, not enemy-occupied, not across impassable, not exceeding capacity.
- Units unable to retreat are eliminated.
- Corps retreating: All but one unit detached (retreating player chooses).
- Retreating units turned face-up at start, face-down at end.

### Morale
- Tracked on Morale Track.
- Losing army loses 1 morale point per strength point lost in attack or retreat.
- If morale at 1, next loss causes demoralization, unless from artillery attack (artillery attacks cannot cause demoralization).
- French gain 4 morale points when first reinforcement unit enters.

### Elite Units
- **Heavy Cavalry:** 3-strength cavalry. First commitment (lead, counter-attack, retreat, loss) causes 2-point morale penalty (cannot demoralize).
- **Guard Infantry:** 3-strength infantry. First commitment causes 4-point morale penalty (cannot demoralize). Cannot pair with non-Guard in lead or counter-attack.
- **Guard Attack:** May be declared in Step 1 if attack includes Guard. Must not be obstructed, not a feint, and leading units must be Guard. Subtract 1 from each 1- or 2-strength defense leading unit. If defeated, attacker loses 3 additional morale and cannot declare more Guard Attacks.

### The Santon (Optional)
- If French fixed battery in Santon:  
  - Must set up in reserve.  
  - May lead attack/defense from reserve across any approach.  
  - Approach penalties apply even if defending from reserve.  
- Other artillery in Santon cannot lead attack/defense.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends immediately if one army is demoralized (morale reduced to 0). Undemoralized army wins decisive victory.
- If no decisive victory, marginal victory awarded after final round.

**Marginal Victory Conditions:**
- **No French Reinforcements:** Allied wins if Allies control at least one blue star and French control no green, red, or black stars. Otherwise, French win.
- **With French Reinforcements:** French win if Allies control no blue stars and French control at least one green, one red, and one black star. Otherwise, Allied win.

**Control of Objective Locale (red, black, green, blue stars):**
- Occupied by a corps with at least one infantry or artillery unit.
- Road path exists from locale to main road reinforcement entry locale (Allies: 2, French: 1), no enemy-occupied locales on path.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a unit be moved and attached in same turn?** Yes. Use Unit Move, then Attach command.
- **Can two artillery units attack together?** Yes, if both blocking same approach and each uses a Unit Move command.
- **Can a corps attack and then detach units?** No. A commander can only give one corps command per turn.
- **Can a unit retreat to a locale at capacity?** No. Retreat cannot exceed capacity. Excess units eliminated.
- **Can a commander be a defending piece alone?** No. Must be with at least one unit from its corps.
- **Can the same units defend twice on same approach?** Yes, if first defense was an artillery attack.
- **Can cavalry end road move on approach?** Only if all moving units are cavalry and approach crossed by road.
- **Can a corps move through a full locale by road?** No. Corps road movement restrictions apply: cannot enter locale if reserve already occupied by units that moved in.
