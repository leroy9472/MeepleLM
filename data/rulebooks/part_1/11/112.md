## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Condottiere*, players take on the role of mercenary generals (Condottieri) vying for control of Renaissance Italian city-states. Through shifting alliances, betrayal, and tactical card play, the goal is to establish dominance by controlling a chain of adjacent regions. Victory comes through military strength, political maneuvering, and clever use of special cards.

### 2. Components  
- **Deck of 110 cards**, including:  
  - **Mercenary Cards**: Orange border, numbered 1–10  
    - 10 × 1-strength  
    - 8 × each of 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 10-strength  
  - **Special Cards** (non-mercenary, not affected by Winter, Spring, Drummer, or Scarecrow unless specified):  
    - Courtesan (12) – strength 1, red border  
    - Heroine (3) – strength 10, not a mercenary  
    - Winter (3)  
    - Spring (3)  
    - Drummer (6)  
    - Scarecrow (16)  
    - Bishop (6)  
    - Surrender (3)  
- **Condottiere Token**: Determines turn order and battle location  
- **Control Markers (Pawns)**: One set per player, to claim regions  
- **Favor of the Pope Token** (used with Bishop card)  

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose a starting player.  
2. Deal **10 cards face down** to each player.  
3. The starting player takes the **Condottiere token** and places it on any unclaimed region to begin the first battle.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of multiple battles. A round ends when only one player has cards left in hand.  

**Battle Sequence**:  
1. **Choose Battle Site**: The player with the Condottiere token selects an unclaimed region (no control marker or Pope token).  
2. **Turn Order**: Starting with the Condottiere holder, players take turns clockwise.  
3. **Player Actions (on turn)**:  
   - **Play a card** face-up in front of them (adds to battle line)  
   - **Pass** (may not play further cards this battle, but can still win)  
   - Players may pass even on their first turn.  
4. **Battle Ends When**:  
   - All players have passed  
   - A **Surrender** card is played  
   - A **Bishop** card is played  
   - (Note: One player may continue playing after others pass)  
5. **Resolve Battle**:  
   - Compare total strengths (modified by special cards)  
   - Determine winner and Condottiere token transfer  
   - Discard all played cards  
6. **Discard Hands**: Any player with **no Mercenary cards in hand** may discard their entire hand.  
7. **Check for End of Round**:  
   - If only one (or zero) players have cards left → new round begins  
   - That player may keep up to **2 cards**, discards the rest  
   - Shuffle all cards and discards; deal **10 cards + 1 per controlled region** to each player

  - **2–3 players**: 6 total regions **or** 4 adjacent regions  
  - **4–6 players**: 5 total regions **or** 3 adjacent regions  
- If all regions are claimed and no one meets victory condition:  
  - Player with **most regions** wins  
  - If tied: **Final battle**  
    - All players discard hands  
    - Shuffle all 110 cards  
    - Deal **10 + 1 per controlled region** to each  
    - Battle begins; player to **left of Condottiere holder** goes first  
    - If final battle ties: **tied players share victory**  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you play after others pass?** Yes. A single player may continue playing cards indefinitely.  
- **Do Spring/Winter stack?** No. Only one of each can be active; new one cancels the other.  
- **Is Heroine affected by Drummer?** No. Heroine is not a Mercenary.  
- **Can Scarecrow retrieve opponent’s Mercenary?** Only if house-ruled; standard rules allow retrieval of **own** Mercenary only.  
- **What if no one plays a card?** Battle ends with no winner. Condottiere passes left.  
- **Can you choose not to place the next battle?** Yes. The Condottiere holder may pass the token to the player on their left instead.
