# Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Spyfall is a social deduction game where one player is the spy, unaware of the current location, while all others know the location and their role within it.  
- **Spy Objective**: Identify the location without being exposed, or survive until the end of the round.  
- **Non-Spy Objective**: Identify and vote out the spy without revealing the location through careless questions or answers.

2. Components  
- 208 cards: 26 location decks (each with 7 role cards and 1 spy card)  
- 26 ziplock bags (one per location)  
- Rulebook with location reference  
- Stopwatch or timer (not included)

3. Setup  
- Sort cards into 26 location decks, each in its own ziplock bag. Each deck contains 7 role cards and 1 spy card.  
- Choose a dealer for the first round (e.g., the most suspicious-looking player).  
- Dealer randomly selects one ziplock bag (location deck).  
- From the selected deck, dealer deals one card to each player, face down.  
  - Number of cards dealt = number of players.  
  - The spy card is included; all others are role cards for that location.  
- Players look at their cards privately for a few seconds, then place them face down.  
- Recommended round length: 8 minutes.  
- Number of rounds: Agreed upon before the game (recommended: 5 rounds).

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Dealer starts the timer and asks the first question to any other player by name.  
- Players take turns asking one question at a time:  
  - Only one question per turn (no follow-ups).  
  - The player who answers then asks a new question to any player except the one who just asked them.  
  - Questions should be relevant to the location but not reveal it outright.  
- Non-spies know both the location and their role (e.g., "Pilot" on an Airplane) and should answer in character.  
- The spy must ask and answer carefully to blend in while gathering clues.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Questioning Rules**:  
  - One question per player per turn.  
  - No immediate back-and-forth (cannot ask the player who just asked you).  
  - Answers can be any form (short, long, evasive, in-character).  
- **Roleplay**: Players may choose to roleplay their assigned character (e.g., "Knight" in Crusader Army), which adds depth but is optional.  
- **Timer**: Round lasts until one of three end conditions is met.

6. Scoring & End Game  
A round ends when any of the following occur:  
1. **Time Runs Out (8 minutes)**:  
   - Dealer leads a vote, starting with themselves, going clockwise.  
   - Each player publicly accuses one player of being the spy.  
   - If all votes point to the same player (unanimous), and that player is the spy → non-spies win.  
   - If not unanimous or the accused is innocent → spy wins.  
2. **Player Calls a Vote (Accusation)**:  
   - Any player may pause the timer once per round to accuse another and call a vote.  
   - If all other players agree (unanimous), the round ends.  
     - If the accused is the spy → non-spies win; accuser gets +1 point.  
     - If the accused is innocent → spy wins.  
   - If vote fails (not unanimous), play resumes.  
3. **Spy Ends the Round**:  
   - Spy may reveal their card at any time (except during a vote) and guess the location.  
   - Spy consults the rulebook’s location list and names the location.  
   - If correct → spy wins.  
   - If incorrect → non-spies win.  

**Scoring**:  
- **Spy Wins**:  
  - 2 points for winning  
  - +2 if they correctly guess the location  
  - +2 if players unanimously vote for an innocent player  
- **Non-Spies Win**:  
  - 1 point each for winning  
  - +1 point for the player who initiated a successful accusation vote  

**Round Cleanup**:  
- Used location deck is removed from the game (cannot be reused).  
- The spy from the current round becomes the dealer for the next round.  

**End of Game**:  
- After the agreed number of rounds, the player with the most points wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can the spy ask obvious questions?**  
  Yes, but doing so may draw suspicion. Questions should sound natural.  
- **What if two players want to speak at once?**  
  Follow the turn order: the last responder asks the next question.  
- **Can non-spies reveal the location to catch the spy?**  
  No — doing so helps the spy win by making it impossible to guess correctly without exposure.  
- **What if the spy is caught but the location was nearly revealed?**  
  Still a non-spy win as long as the spy was identified.  
- **Can the same location appear twice?**  
  No — each location is removed after use.  
- **Can the spy vote during a group vote?**  
  Yes — the spy votes like any other player when time runs out.
