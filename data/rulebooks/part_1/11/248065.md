## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Zombicide: Invader is a cooperative survival game set on the mining station PK-L7, where players control Survivors fighting against Xenos—alien creatures that have turned aggressive and zombie-like. The core objective is to complete mission-specific goals (such as retrieving objectives, rescuing characters, or eliminating threats) while surviving waves of Xenos. Campaign play enhances the narrative, linking missions together for long-term progression, character development, and persistent consequences.

The ultimate goal across a campaign is to successfully complete all five missions. Failure occurs if Survivors are eliminated and no replacements remain.

### 2. Components
- Survivor miniatures and ID cards  
- Xeno miniatures (Workers, Tanks, Hunters, Abominations, Driller variants)  
- Equipment cards (standard and prototype)  
- Objective tokens (white, blue, red, etc.)  
- Danger Level tracker  
- XP and Armor trackers  
- Noise tokens  
- Injury tokens (house rule; use tokens from other games if unavailable)  
- Mold and Pit tokens (for combined gameplay)  
- Zombie miniatures and cards (optional crossover content)  
- All-Out Dice (custom dice with Explosion, numbers 2–5, Alien Head)  
- Skill Dice (Black, Red, Blue, White 8- or 12-sided dice with special results)  

### 3. Setup
1. Choose a Mission and set up the board according to its layout.
2. Place Spawn Zones and assign appropriate Xeno spawn cards based on current Danger Level.
3. Shuffle the Equipment deck (standard or modified with combined rules).
4. Place objective tokens as specified by the mission.
5. Each Survivor starts with:
   - 3 Armor points
   - 1 Starting Equipment card
   - Oxygen tank if required (e.g., exterior zones)
6. For campaign play:
   - Apply campaign-specific starting gear retention
   - Add pre-placed Zombie cards in zones with facedown or red objectives (if using Zombie rules)
   - Resolve additional Xenos spawn at start of Missions 02–05 based on increasing Danger Level (Blue → Yellow → Orange → Red)

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round follows this sequence:

#### 01 – Players’ Phase
The First Player activates all their Survivors, then play proceeds clockwise. Each Survivor has 3 Actions per turn.

**Available Actions:**
- **Move**: Spend 1 Action to move 1 Zone. Spend +1 Action if starting in a Zone with Xenos.
- **Search**: Once per turn, in a room free of Xenos and Mold. Draw 1 card from the Equipment deck. Soldiers can only Search in Security Rooms.
- **Door Activation (Free, 1x/turn)**: Place or remove a closed door token on an opening (not in Mold Zones or where door is destroyed).
- **Reorganize/Trade**: Exchange Equipment with another Survivor in the same Zone. Attach/detach ammo (Plenty of Bullets, Energy Cell, Canister).
- **Combat Action**:
  - **Melee Action**: Requires equipped Melee weapon.
  - **Ranged Action**: Requires equipped Ranged weapon.
- **Take/Activate Objective**: Interact with an objective in the same Zone.
- **Make Noise**: Place a Noise token in the current Zone.
- **Do Nothing**: Lose remaining Actions.
- **Machine Actions**: Requires Remote Control skill or token. Includes controlling Bots or Sentry Guns.

**Dual-Wielding:** Two identical weapons with Dual symbol can be used together in one Ranged or Melee Action (both must target the same Zone).

**Concentrated Attack:** Before rolling, declare one target. Multiply damage by number of hits. Only declared target can be hit; excess damage is lost.

#### 02 – Xenos’ Phase
**Step 1 – Activation: Attack or Move**
- All Xenos spend 1 Action:
  - **Attack**: If in same Zone as a Survivor, they must Attack.
  - **Move**: Otherwise, move toward Survivors using shortest path (ignoring closed doors). Split evenly between equal paths.
  - **Spoiler Abominations**: Place Mold tokens in room/corridor Zones during Move.
  - **Hunters**: Get 2 Actions; repeat activation step after all Xenos act once.

**Line of Sight Rules:**
- Corridors & Exterior Zones: Straight lines parallel to board edges; no diagonal vision.
- Rooms: See into all adjacent Zones connected by an opening. Limited to 1 Zone distance.
- Line of Sight blocked by walls unless opening exists.

**Targeting Priority:** When multiple targets are valid, players choose elimination order.

**Step 2 – Spawn**
- Draw Xeno card for each Spawn Zone (clockwise).
- Spawn level determined by highest Danger Level among Survivors.
- If out of miniatures (except Abominations), place remaining, give Abominations extra activation, then spawn Spoiler Abomination.

#### 03 – End Phase
- Remove all Noise tokens.
- Pass First Player token clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Ammo Types:**
- **Bullet Icon**: Solid ammo; cannot be used in exterior zones.
- **Energy Icon**: Powered; usable anywhere.
- **Prototype**: Special weapons requiring Energy Cells.

**Noisy Equipment:** Using certain gear produces Noise tokens, attracting Xenos.

**Friendly Fire:** Ranged attacks that miss automatically hit Survivors in target Zone.

**Line of Sight & Movement:**
- Mold Zones:
  - Active Mold = Room for LOS; Inactive Mold = Corridor.
  - Cannot spread on exterior zones.
  - Removes Zone special properties (e.g., no Oxygen refill).
  - Mission lost if 2+ Spawn Zones linked by continuous Mold.
- Airlocks: Separate interior from exterior. Require Oxygen tank to enter exterior. No LOS through closed airlock doors.

**Machine Actions:** Controlled via Remote token or Skill. Machine gains XP like Survivor; user’s Skills do not apply.

**All-Out Dice (Advanced Rule):**
- Optional dice system using custom results:
  - **Explosion (1)**: Fumble – weapon malfunctions (flip face down); dual-wield: flip one per Fumble; ≥2 Fumbles = broken.
  - **Alien Head (6)**: Hit + Taunt – all Xenos in one chosen Zone gain activation toward attacker.
  - **2–5**: Normal hit results.
- Can be used for All-Out Attacks (higher risk/reward).
- Unarmed All-Out Attack: Roll All-Out Pool; Alien Head = 1 Damage; Fumble = Survivor laid down; ≥2 Fumbles = also take 1 Damage.

**Skill Dice (Advanced Rule):**
- Acquired instead of standard Skills.
- Types: Black, Red, Blue, White (most powerful).
- Used during All-Out Attacks to add special effects (e.g., extra hits, surge, re-roll, defense).
- Opportunity Action allows reuse of used Skills in same turn (Melee only).

**Campaign Mechanics (Fanmade Rules):**
- **Equipment Retention:**
  - Reach Orange Danger Level: Keep 1 standard Equipment.
  - Reach Red Danger Level: Keep 2 standard OR 1 Prototype.
  - All Survivors keep Starting Equipment.
- **Knocked Out (KO):**
  - At 0 Armor, Survivor is KOed: lay model down, discard Equipment, lose half XP (rounded up), gain 1 Injury.
  - KOed Survivor cannot act, ignored by Xenos.
  - Can be Assisted by Survivor in same Zone (no Xenos present).
- **Assist Action:**
  - Stand up KOed Survivor and restore 1 Armor.
- **Elimination:**
  - KOed at mission end OR 3rd Injury = eliminated.
  - Return ID and miniature to box; new Survivor replaces in next mission.
  - Campaign lost if no Survivors left.
- **Injuries:**
  - Permanent for campaign.
  - At start of each mission, lose 1 Armor per Injury.
  - 3 Injuries = elimination.
- **Repair:** At end of mission, repair all Armor loss (but not Injuries).
