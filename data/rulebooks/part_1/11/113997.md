## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   In *Mysterium*, one player takes on the role of the Spirit — the soul of a former mansion owner wrongly accused and executed for a crime. The other players are Investigators (or Psychics) invited to uncover the truth. Through cryptic dreams, the Spirit guides the Investigators to reconstruct the events of the crime: identifying who (Character), where (Location), and what (Item) were involved. The ultimate goal is to determine the true culprit among the suspects. The game must be completed within 7 rounds (days). If the Investigators correctly identify the true culprit within this time, all players win. If not, the Spirit remains trapped and all players lose.

2. **Components**  
   - 84 Dream Cards (green or blue backs)  
   - 19 Character Cards (brown and blue backs)  
   - 19 Location Cards (brown and blue backs)  
   - 20 Item Cards (brown and blue backs)  
   - 6 Investigator Boards (one per player color)  
   - 12 Wooden Player Discs (2 per player: 1 for guessing, 1 for marking secret sets)  
   - 6 Clock Tokens (to track progress on Investigator Boards)  
   - 1 Calendar Board (7-day tracker)  
   - 1 Round Marker (tracks current day)  
   - (Optional) Spirit Board (from expansion)  

3. **Setup**  
   - Choose one player to be the Spirit; others are Investigators.  
   - Based on player count and difficulty, draw and place face-up a specific number of Character, Location, and Item cards (brown backs) on the table. Return unused brown-backed cards to the box.  
     - Easy: 6 cards per type (4 players), up to 10 (6 players, hard)  
   - Place the Calendar Board nearby and set the Round Marker to Day 1 (Monday).  
   - Each Investigator chooses a color and receives:  
     - 1 Investigator Board  
     - 1 Clock Token (placed on "What?" at start)  
     - 1 Wooden Disc (for guessing)  
   - The Spirit receives:  
     - Dream Card deck  
     - 1 Wooden Disc in each Investigator’s color (to mark secret sets)  
   - The Spirit finds matching blue-backed Character, Location, and Item cards for those on the table.  
   - For each Investigator, the Spirit secretly creates a face-down set of one Character, one Location, and one Item, placing the matching-colored wooden disc on each set.  
   - Unused blue-backed cards are returned to the box.  
   - The Spirit draws 6 (or 7, in Full Investigation variant) Dream Cards.  

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   The game lasts up to 7 rounds and consists of two main phases:  
   - **Phase 1: Reconstruction of Events**  
     - Goal: Each Investigator must identify their assigned Character, Location, and Item in order: first Item, then Location, then Character.  
     - Each round has three phases:  
       1. **Dream**  
          - The Spirit gives one or more Dream Cards to an Investigator to hint at their current unknown (Item → Location → Character).  
          - No hints about Location or Character may be given until the prior element is guessed.  
          - After giving cards, the Spirit draws back to full hand (6 or 7).  
          - The Spirit may discard entire hand and redraw, limited by difficulty:  
            - Easy: Once per round  
            - Normal: 3 times per game  
            - Difficult: Once per game  
            - Very Difficult: Never  
       2. **Oneiromancy (Investigation)**  
          - Investigators discuss Dream Cards and each places their wooden disc on the face-up card they believe is theirs.  
          - The Spirit must remain silent and give no verbal or physical cues.  
       3. **Mysterious Signs**  
          - The Spirit reveals whether each guess was correct.  
          - Correct: Flip the hidden card, discard used Dream Cards, move Clock Token down.  
          - Incorrect: Keep Dream Cards for future reference.  
          - Move Round Marker forward.  
          - Return wooden discs.  
     - Repeat until all Investigators have correctly guessed all three elements.  
   - **Phase 2: Finding the True Culprit**  
     - The Spirit selects one of the correctly guessed Character sets as the true culprit.  
     - Shuffle all assigned Character cards and secretly draw one — this is the culprit. Place it face down.  
     - Remove all non-Character cards from play.  
     - The Spirit gives exactly 3 Dream Cards: one hinting at the Character, one at the Location, one at the Item — but does not say which is which.  
     - Investigators discuss and must reach a majority vote on the culprit.  
     - The Spirit reveals if correct.  
       - Correct: All players win.  
       - Incorrect: Round ends. No new Dream Cards are given. Repeat Oneiromancy with same 3 cards.  
       - If the Round Marker reaches Day 7 and no correct guess is made, all players lose.  

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Dream Card Communication**: The Spirit communicates only through symbolic Dream Cards.  
   - **Progressive Revelation**: Each Investigator uncovers their set in sequence: Item → Location → Character.  
   - **Majority Rule**: In the final phase, a majority vote is required to accuse a culprit.  
   - **Hand Management**: The Spirit maintains a hand of 6 (or 7) Dream Cards, redrawing after each distribution.  
   - **No Verbal Clues**: The Spirit may not speak, gesture, or otherwise hint — doing so results in immediate loss.  

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - **Win Condition**: Investigators correctly identify the true culprit during Phase 2 within 7 rounds.  
   - **Loss Condition**:  
     - Round Marker reaches Day 7 (Sunday) and culprit is not identified.  
     - Spirit breaks silence or gives non-card hints.  
   - There is no individual scoring; the game is fully cooperative. Victory or defeat is shared.  

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **What if the Spirit has no useful cards?**  
     They may discard and redraw based on difficulty limits.  
   - **Can Investigators help each other?**  
     Yes — once an Investigator completes their set, they may assist others in interpretation.  
   - **What happens to guessed cards?**  
     Correct Item and Location cards are returned to the box. Correct Character cards remain for Phase 2.  
   - **Can the Spirit change their mind about the culprit?**  
     No — the culprit is chosen at the start of Phase 2 and remains fixed.  
   - **What if there’s a tie in the final vote?**  
     Discussion continues until a majority is reached. No accusation can be made without majority.  
   - **2-Player Variant**: One Investigator plays two sets simultaneously, managing two boards and two sets of cards.  
   - **Full Investigation Variant**: Spirit starts with 7 Dream Cards. In Phase 2, the Spirit gives 3 Dream Cards (Character, Location, Item) without labeling, and players must deduce all three elements of the culprit’s set.
