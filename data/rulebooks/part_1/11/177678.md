### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the 7 rounds consists of:
1. **Round Setup**
2. **Perform Actions**
3. **Rewards Phase**

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Phase 1: Round Setup
- **Alliance Tiles**: Draw and place 1 face-up tile in each empty Marriage and Diplomatic Mission slot in active cities (5 cities total, fewer in 2P/3P). Do not refill filled slots.
- **Action Dice**: Roll all Action Dice and place each on the board in the area matching its color.
- **Assignment Tiles**: Shuffle the 10 Assignment Tiles and place 2 per die color above corresponding dice areas.

#### Phase 2: Perform Actions
- Players act in turn order. Each turn, a player may:
  - **Take an Action**: Select a die from the board and place it on a matching-color Action Slot on their board, then perform one of three actions.
  - **Pass**: Move Turn Order Token to "Passed" area; no further actions this phase.
- A player may take up to 4 actions per round. After 4 actions, must pass on next turn.
- To take a die, a player must:
  - Have a matching empty Action Slot.
  - Pay any difference in value between the die and the slot cost (if die < slot value).
  - Be able to perform one of the actions linked to that slot.
  - Not have already taken 4 actions.

**Actions** (when placing a die on an Action Slot):
1. **Hire Helper**:
   - Take 1 Helper from supply.
   - Place it on an empty Helper slot matching the ring color on the Hire Helper icon (not the Action Slot color).
   - Pay the cost shown on the Helper slot.
   - Helper remains and provides bonuses when activated.

2. **Assignment Action**:
   - Choose one of the two Assignment Tiles in the matching color column.
   - Spend required male or female meeples from personal supply to general stock.
   - If the tile shows a range (e.g., ".3"), spend 1–3 meeples and gain the bonus multiple times.
   - Receive the bonus (e.g., advancement, Florins, VP).
   - Assignment Tiles remain and can be reused by others.

3. **Signoria Action** (depends on Action Slot color):
   - **Yellow (Florins)**: Gain 3 Florins.
   - **Red (Marriage)**:
     - Take 1 female meeple from personal supply.
     - Place in lowest-numbered empty city slot (choose either if tied).
     - Pay dowry equal to slot value (1–4 Florins); may pay up to 4 additional Florins.
     - Gain 2 VP per Florin paid (dowry + extra).
     - If a matching Alliance Tile is in the city’s Marriage Slot and needed for your Marriage Plan (and not already collected), take it and place face-up in your Marriage Row.
     - Note: Can marry even if ineligible for tile, or if tile already taken—just to gain VP.
   - **Purple (Offspring)**:
     - Count how many of your male family members (including you) have Brides.
     - Roll 1 white die per bride:
       - 1–3: Gain 1 female meeple
       - 4–6: Gain 1 male meeple
     - Take new meeples from general stock to personal supply. If stock is insufficient, take only what’s available.
   - **Grey (Diplomatic Mission)**:
     - Take 1 male meeple from a Career Track with rank ≥ the lowest city slot value in a chosen city (rank = space number, 1–4).
     - Place meeple in the lowest-numbered empty city slot (choose either if tied).
     - Score VP equal to the value adjacent to the Career Track space the meeple was on (1–13).
     - If the city’s Diplomatic Mission slot has an Alliance Tile matching your Career Plan (and not already collected), take it and place face-up in the corresponding Career Row.
     - Note: Can perform mission for VP even if ineligible for tile.
   - **Turquoise (Tracks)**:
     - Spend 1–4 Advancement Points (equal to die value).
     - Points may be split across:
       - Placing a male meeple from personal supply onto the bottom of a Career Track.
       - Advancing a male meeple one space up a Career Track.
       - Advancing your Initiative Token one space up the Initiative Track.
     - Bonuses:
       - Reaching 4th space on any Career Track: gain 2 Florins.
       - Reaching 6th space on any Career Track: gain 2 advancements on Initiative Track.
     - On Initiative Track, if moving to a space with other players’ tokens, place yours on top. Stack order breaks ties in turn order.
     - Cannot exceed top of Initiative Track (value 10).

**Helper Activation**:
- After performing any action, player may activate all Helpers in the same column (color) as the Action Slot used.
- Activation order: top to bottom.
- Each Helper provides a specific bonus (e.g., extra movement, VP, Florins, face-down Alliance Tile).

#### Phase 3: Rewards Phase
1. **Score Initiative VP**: Each player gains VP based on current position on Initiative Track.
2. **Establish New Turn Order**:
   - Reorder Turn Order Tokens to match Initiative Track (highest first).
   - Break ties using stack order (top disc first).
   - Reset all Initiative Tokens to '0', stacked in new turn order (first player on top).
3. **Reward Tiles**:
   - Each player sums values of dice they took.
   - If sum ≤ personal Threshold (base = 13, up to 22 via bonuses), gain reward.
   - **Rounds 1–5**: Choose either:
     - Bonus shown on current Reward Tile, OR
     - 3 Florins.
     - Then, optionally: Add a Bride to an unmarried brother (meeple on left of Player Board). Gain VP shown on that brother’s space. In rounds 2–5, also gain 2 Florins.
   - **Rounds 6–7**: Gain VP shown on current Reward Tile. Optionally, pay exactly 5 Florins to gain 5 VP (only once).
   - Discard current Reward Tile. Return meeples used to adjust threshold to general stock.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after Round 7. Final scoring:
1. **Career Meeples**: For each male meeple still on a Career Track, gain half the VP value of its space (rounded down).
2. **Delivering the Plan**: For each Career or Marriage Row with at least 3 Alliance Tiles (face-up or face-down), gain VP shown on all tiles in that row.
3. **Winning**: Highest VP wins. Tiebreaker: highest position on Turn Order Track (use stack order to break ties).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Full Cities**: Use Open Gates variant (pay 4 Florins for Marriage, place rank 4 meeple for Diplomatic Mission). Meeple returns to general stock; score VP but no tile.
- **Alliance Tiles Exhausted**: Use face-down proxies if stack runs out.
- **General Stock Exhausted**: Take only available meeples.
- **Multiple Actions**: A player may take up to 4 actions per round.
- **Threshold Adjustment**: Some Assignment Tiles or Helpers allow increasing Threshold by spending meeples.
- **Face-Down Alliance Tiles**: Gained via certain bonuses. Can be placed on any row. Count toward "at least 3 tiles" for scoring but do not need to match plan.
