## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Players are animals in a magical forest competing to collect the most delicious fruits and turn them into fabled juices. The goal is to be the first to buy a certain number of fabled juices, depending on player count, and win the game by having the most juices when the end condition is met.

### 2. Components
- 240 Location Cards (#1–#58: 4 copies each; #59: 8 copies)
- 60 Fruit Cards (12 each of: bananas, coconuts, grapes, pineapples, strawberries)
- 6 Wooden Animals & 6 Matching Animal Tokens
- 1 Wooden Thief Token
- 5 Fruit Tokens
- 3 Double Turn Tokens
- 3 Wild Tokens
- 10 Fruit-Mix Cards
- Start Player Marker (unused animal)

### 3. Setup
1. **Initial Game Setup**:
   - Place the Location Deck in order: #1 on top, #59 on bottom.
   - Draw the 4 cards each of Locations #1–#6 and place them as separate stacks (6 stacks of 4).
   - Shuffle the 60 Fruit Cards and deal 2 to each player. Place the rest face-down as the draw stack.
   - Each player chooses an animal and matching token.
   - Set aside the thief, fruit tokens, double turn tokens, wild tokens, and fruit-mix cards (not used in first game).
   - Choose a start player and give them an unused animal as the start marker.

2. **Subsequent Games**:
   - Use the 24 Location Cards remaining from the previous game as the new setup.
   - The loser of the previous game becomes the new start player.
   - Shuffle and deal 2 fruits per player.
   - Ensure all required components (tokens, thief, etc.) are available based on the current locations.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn has two steps:

#### Step 1: Move to a New Location
- You must move your animal to a different location card.
- If the location is occupied, give 1 fruit (your choice) from your hand to each player already there.
- If you have fewer fruits than players, give to as many as you can (choose recipients).
- If you have no fruits, you move without giving any away.

#### Step 2: Use Action or Buy Fabled Juice
Choose **one**:
- **Use the Location’s Action**: Follow the text on the card. If you cannot meet requirements and the card has a signpost (most do), you may instead draw 1 fruit.
- **Buy the Location as a Fabled Juice**: Pay the fruit cost shown on the card. Smoothies count as any fruit. Discard the fruits, take the location card (place face down as a juice), and draw a new location card:
  - If it's a new location, start a new stack.
  - If it's an existing location, place it on top of the matching stack.
  - If you buy the last card of a stack, remove your animal from the board and return it to your play area.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Drawing Fruits**: Always take into hand. If the draw stack is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new stack.
- **Hand Limit**: None.
- **Exchanges**: When a player must give a fruit, they choose which one.
- **"Another Player" vs. "Any Player"**: "Another player" excludes yourself; "any player" includes you.
- **Signpost Rule**: If you cannot fulfill a location’s requirement and it has a signpost, you forfeit the action and draw 1 fruit instead.
- **"Any Number"**: Includes 0 (e.g., discarding 0 fruits is allowed).
- **Market**:
  - Created when first market location is drawn: place 5 fruits face-up in a row.
  - If market empties, refill to 5 at the end of the action (unless the action specifies refill at start).
  - Trade only with the market, not players.
- **Thief**:
  - Added when Location #16 is drawn.
  - When you move to a location with the thief, you must first place 1 fruit from your hand into the market (the thief steals from you).
  - The thief must always move to a new location when used.
- **Tokens**:
  - **Fruit Tokens**: Permanent discount; use instead of a matching fruit when buying a juice. Keep after use.
  - **Wild Tokens**: Can substitute for any 1 fruit when buying a juice.
  - **Double Turn Tokens**: Use at the end of your turn to take another full turn immediately (cannot use in the same turn you acquire it).
  - **Fruit-Mix Cards**: Count as 1 fruit; when used to pay, discard the card.
- **Secured Fruits (Location #12)**: Place fruits face-down under your token. Not counted in hand. Can take them back at any time (all or nothing).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **End Game Trigger**:
  - 2 players: 5 fabled juices
  - 3 players: 4 fabled juices
  - 4–5 players: 3 fabled juices
- When a player meets the trigger, finish the current round so all players have equal turns.
- **Winning**:
  - Player with the most fabled juices wins.
  - Tie: Player with more fruits in hand wins.
  - Still tied: Share victory.
- **Special Rule for Location #59**: To win, a player must have bought Location #59 at least once. If no one has, the game continues until someone does. Only players who own #59 are eligible to win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Empty Draw Stack**: Shuffle discard pile to form new draw stack.
- **Buying Last Card of a Stack**: Return your animal to your play area. On next turn, move to any location.
- **Market Refill**: After actions that empty the market, refill to 5 at the end of the action—unless the action says "refill at start."
- **Thief Movement**: Must move to a different location; cannot stay or move to same spot.
- **Token Pools Empty**:
  - Fruit/Wild/Double Turn Tokens: If pool is empty, all players return their tokens; then you take one.
  - Fruit-Mix Cards: If pool is empty, take 2 market fruits instead.
- **Location #59 in Final Game**: If drawn after game end is triggered, ignore the "must buy" rule and end game normally.
- **Multiple Players Tied for Richest/Poorest**: Eligible for effects (e.g., Location #10, #15).
