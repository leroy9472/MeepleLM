# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The 3 Year Solo Campaign is an unofficial variant for Stardew Valley: The Board Game, designed for solo play over three full in-game years (12 seasons total). The objective is to fulfill all campaign goals by the end of the third year.

- Complete all yearly goals as outlined on the campaign sheet.
- Success is achieved only if all goals are completed by the end of Year 3.
- Failure occurs if any required goal remains unfulfilled at the end of Year 3.

Intermediate goals may be completed early, but final totals must be met cumulatively (e.g., Year 2 requires 4 animal products and Year 3 requires 8 — only 8 total are needed, with the first 4 counting toward both).

## 2. Components
This variant uses all standard Stardew Valley board game components, with the following special handling:
- Epic Items Deck
- Mermaid’s Pendant (from Epic Items)
- Standard and Random Season Decks
- Community Center Bundle Cards
- Campaign Sheet (player-made or printed)
- Grandpa Goals (replaced by campaign sheet)

## 3. Setup
Follow standard solo setup rules, then apply the following modifications:

### Game Duration
- The game spans 3 full years (12 seasons).
- Year 1: Use the Standard Season Deck.
- Years 2 and 3: Use a Random Season Deck (4 random cards per season).

### Mermaid's Pendant
- Take the top 7 cards from the Epic Items deck.
- Shuffle the Mermaid’s Pendant into these 7 cards.
- Place all 8 cards face-down on top of the Epic Items deck.

### Bundles
- All Bundle Cards are used and shuffled normally.
- Place each room’s Bundle deck face-up at its respective Community Center room.
- Players can see all possible bundles from the start.

### Player Setup
- Choose one character (solo rules apply).
- Select a starting tool; it remains fixed for all 3 years.
- Grandpa Goals are not used — they are replaced entirely by the campaign sheet.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each year follows the standard round structure:
1. **Season Phase**: Draw and resolve Season Cards.
2. **Planning Phase**: Move pawns and trade (in solo, plan actions).
3. **Action Phase**: Perform actions using Action + Action or Action + Move + Action.
4. **End of Turn**: Trigger one End of Turn Effect as many times as possible.

At the end of each season:
- When a Season End Card is drawn, resolve its effects.
- Immediately draw the next Season Card (no pause between seasons).
- After Winter ends, remove Winter tiles and place Spring tiles.

### Year Transition
At the end of each year (after Winter):
1. Remove Winter tiles and place Spring tiles.
2. Take 3 Profession Upgrade cards and choose one to keep.
3. Prepare the next year’s Season Deck (Random for Years 2 and 3).
4. Begin the next year.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Bundles
- No hearts are required to turn in bundles.
- One Heart Token allows you to cycle through a room’s Bundle deck: move the top card to the bottom.
- When a bundle is completed:
  - Gain its reward.
  - If it's the last bundle in the room, gain one Epic Item.

### Goal Completion
- Goals are tracked via the campaign sheet.
- Complete goals from left to right on the sheet.
- You may complete Year 2 or Year 3 goals during earlier years.
- Only the final year’s total must be met (intermediate goals are not strict checkpoints unless playing on higher difficulty).

### Winter Season Ending
- Treat Winter like any other season.
- After Winter ends:
  - Replace Winter tiles with Spring tiles.
  - Draw 3 Profession Upgrades, keep 1.
  - Start the next year with the new Season Deck.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### Winning the Game
- Victory is achieved only if all goals on the campaign sheet are fulfilled by the end of Year 3.
- If all goals are met, you win.
- If any goal remains unfulfilled, you lose.

### Difficulty Options
- **Standard Mode**: Must meet all intermediate and final goals. Failing an intermediate goal results in loss.
- **Relaxed Mode**: Only the final goals at the end of Year 3 must be fulfilled. Intermediate goals can be ignored.

### FAQ / Clarifications
- Goals are **not cumulative** — totals are progressive.
  - Example: Year 2 requires 4 animal products, Year 3 requires 8. Only 8 total are needed.
- Bundles can be cycled using Heart Tokens (1 Heart = move top bundle to bottom).
- The Mermaid’s Pendant will appear during gameplay and can be obtained normally once drawn.
- All buildings, animals, tools, and upgrades persist between years unless specified otherwise.
