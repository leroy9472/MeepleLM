## Attika — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Attika is a strategic tile-placement and resource management game set in ancient Greece. Players act as builders developing the landscape by placing buildings to expand settlements and connect sacred shrines.  

**Objective:**  
Be the first player to either:  
- Place your 30th building, or  
- Connect two shrine hexes on the main board with a continuous, connected line of your buildings.  
The first player to meet either condition wins immediately.

### 3. Setup  
**Board Setup:**  
- Shuffle the game board tiles face-down.  
- Reveal and place them face-up according to the layout shown in the rulebook (based on player count).  
- Black hexagons on the layout represent **shrines**.

**Player Setup:**  
- Each player takes:  
  - 1 player board  
  - 30 building tokens of one color  
- Create 4 face-down stacks from the 30 buildings:  
  - 1 stack of 6 black-backed buildings  
  - 3 stacks of 8 white-backed buildings each  
- Place the top building from each of the 4 stacks face-up on the corresponding spaces of your player board.  
- Shuffle the 60 landscape cards and deal:  
  - 2-player game: 4 cards to 1st player, 5 to 2nd  
  - 3-player game: 4, 5, 6 respectively  
  - 4-player game: 4, 5, 6, 7 respectively  
- Choose a starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, choose **one** of the following two actions:

#### Option A: Draw 2 Buildings  
- Draw the top building from **any** of your 4 stacks (you choose which stack).  
- You may immediately **build it** to the main board if you can pay the cost (see *Building Rules*).  
- If not built, place it face-up on your player board in the matching space.  
- Repeat this process one more time (total of 2 draws).  
- After both draws are resolved, you may **forfeit up to 2 draws** to draw 1 landscape card each time (max 2 cards).  
  - You can only draw cards **after** completing both draws.

#### Option B: Build 3 Buildings  
- Take up to 3 buildings from your player board and place them on the main board.  
- You may choose to build fewer than 3.  
- For each build you **forfeit**, you may draw 1 landscape card instead.  
  - You may draw up to 3 cards this way (one per forfeited build).  
  - Cards can only be drawn **after** any buildings you chose to build.

> **Note:** You cannot mix actions—you must fully complete one of the two options per turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Building Costs  
- Each building has a cost shown on its face (e.g., symbols like stone, wood, etc.).  
- To build, you must pay the required symbols using:  
  - Symbols on the **target hex** and its **six adjacent hexes** (including landscape tiles and buildings)  
  - **Landscape cards** from your hand  
- **Card Conversion:** Any 2 landscape cards = 1 of any symbol (wild/joker).

#### Free Building Rule  
- If you place a building **adjacent** to another of your buildings that comes **directly before it** in the arrow chain on your player board, the new building is **free**.  
  - Example: The Tower is free if built adjacent to your Fortress.  
- **Conditions for free build:**  
  - Must be your own building  
  - Must be in correct forward order (no skipping or reverse)  
  - The lead building (first in chain) is **never free**

#### Settlements  
- A **settlement** is any group of your connected buildings (orthogonal adjacency).  
- You may have multiple settlements.  
- **Starting a new settlement** (placing a building not adjacent to any of your existing buildings):  
  - Costs **1 extra landscape card per existing settlement** you already have.  
  - Example: If you have 2 settlements, starting a third costs 2 extra cards.

#### Amphoras  
- When you complete a **building group** (all 4 buildings in one of the 7 sections of your player board) and they are **all connected** in a single group on the board, you gain 1 **amphora**.  
- Amphoras can be spent during your turn:  
  - Spend 1 amphora to gain **+1** to your current action:  
    - When **drawing**: draw 1 extra building (max 3 total)  
    - When **building**: build 1 extra building (max 4 total)  
  - You may spend multiple amphoras for greater effect.

#### Expanding the Board  
- When a player **depletes one of their 4 building stacks** (draws the last token), immediately after resolving the draw:  
  - Add 1 new land tile to the main board  
  - The new tile must:  
    - Touch at least one existing land tile or shrine  
    - Be placed in any orientation  
  - This expansion can open new building spaces and affect future play.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
There is **no scoring**—the game ends **immediately** when a player meets **either** of the following conditions:  
1. Places their **30th building** on the board  
2. Connects **two shrine hexes** with a continuous, connected line of their buildings  

That player **wins instantly**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build a building not on my player board?**  
  No. You can only build buildings currently face-up on your player board.  
- **Can I build out of order on my player board?**  
  Yes, as long as the building is face-up on your board, you may build it at any time.  
- **Do I get an amphora if my completed group is not connected?**  
  No. The four buildings must be part of a **connected group** on the main board.  
- **Can I use amphoras to draw more than 3 buildings?**  
  Only if you use them to boost the "Draw 2" action. With 1 amphora, you can draw up to 3 buildings (2 base + 1 from amphora).  
- **Can I place a new land tile anywhere?**  
  Only if it touches an existing land tile or shrine. Orientation is free.  
- **Do landscape cards have individual values?**  
  No. They are generic resources; only the ratio (2 cards = 1 symbol) matters.
