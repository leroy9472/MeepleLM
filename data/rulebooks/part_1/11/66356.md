### 1. Lore & Objective
The ancient Red Dragon Ashardalon has taken residence at Firestorm Peak, gathering monster soldiers to raid nearby settlements. Heroes must descend into the volcanic dungeon to defeat villains, overcome hazards, and ultimately stop Ashardalon’s reign of terror. The objective varies by adventure but generally involves defeating a villain, completing a mission (e.g., rescuing prisoners, destroying portals), and escaping the dungeon.

### 2. Components
- Hero cards and figures (e.g., Vistra, Quinn, Keyleth, Tarak, Hezkan)
- Monster and Villain cards and figures
- Dungeon tiles (including Start Tile, Long Hallway, Chamber Entrance, Vault, Tunnel Exit, Secure Exit)
- Treasure cards (items, gold values)
- Encounter cards (Traps, Hazards, Curses, Events, Environment)
- Tokens: Healing Surge, Door, Scorch Mark, Trap markers (Pit, Boulder, Lava), Shield, Gear, Time
- Power cards (At-Will, Utility, Daily)
- Experience (XP) pile
- Condition markers (Dazed, Poisoned)
- Adventure-specific components (e.g., Altar, Vast Gate, Ancestral Crystal)

### 3. Setup
1. Choose an adventure and follow its specific setup (e.g., tile stack order, starting location).
2. Shuffle Monster, Encounter, and Treasure decks.
3. Each player selects a Hero, takes matching Hero and Power cards, and places figure on starting tile.
4. Each Hero draws one Treasure card (must be an Item).
5. Prepare Dungeon Tile stack per adventure instructions.
6. Place Healing Surge tokens (usually 2–4) beside the Start Tile.
7. Shuffle Door tokens and place nearby.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn has three phases:
1. **Hero Phase**:
   - If Poisoned, take 1 damage.
   - If at 0 HP, use Healing Surge if available.
   - Perform actions: Move (up to Speed), Attack, Disable Trap, Use Item/Power.
   - May move then attack, attack then move, or make two moves.
   - After defeating monsters, draw one Treasure card (keep or give to another Hero).
   - Remove Dazed condition.
   - Roll 10+ to remove Poisoned.
2. **Exploration Phase**:
   - If on an unexplored edge, draw and place a Dungeon Tile.
   - Draw a Monster card and place figure on scorch mark (if scorch is occupied, player chooses placement).
   - If tile has black triangle, note for Encounter draw.
3. **Villain Phase**:
   - If no tile was placed or placed tile has black triangle, draw an Encounter card (may spend 5 XP to cancel).
   - Activate Villain (if in play).
   - Activate each Monster and Trap card in order of acquisition.
   - Monsters follow tactics (move, attack, spawn, etc.).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Movement**: Move up to Speed in squares; cannot enter monster or wall squares. Diagonal movement allowed.
- **Combat**: Roll d20, add Attack Bonus. If ≥ target’s AC, deal damage.
- **Monster Placement**: New monsters placed on scorch marks; if occupied, player chooses square.
- **Treasure**: One Treasure card per turn. Can give to another Hero only when first received.
- **Conditions**:
  - *Dazed*: May only Move or Attack (not both).
  - *Poisoned*: Take 1 damage at start of Hero Phase; roll 10+ at end to remove.
- **Powers**:
  - *At-Will*: Can be used every turn.
  - *Daily/Utility*: Flip after use; cannot reuse unless reflipped (e.g., by item or campaign rule).
- **Line of Sight**: Not required; heroes and monsters can attack through open paths (not walls).
- **Large Monsters**: Can occupy multiple tiles; considered in all overlapping tiles.
- **Experience (XP)**: Shared party resource. Used to cancel Encounters (5 XP) or Level Up (after natural 20, spend 5 XP).
- **Healing**: Healing Surge restores full HP. Other Heroes can heal unconscious Hero with items/spells (limited to effect amount).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Winning**: Complete adventure objective (e.g., defeat villain, escape with prisoners, destroy portal).
- **Losing**: Any Hero starts turn at 0 HP with no Healing Surges left.
- **Treasure & XP**: Defeated monsters and villains add their cards to XP pile. Treasure cards are drawn immediately after kill (one per turn).
- **Leveling Up**: Roll natural 20 on attack/disable roll, spend 5 XP to flip Hero card to Level 2 (increased HP, AC, Surge, gains critical hit ability).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Long Hallway**: Draw second tile and place it. If second tile has black triangle, draw one Encounter card during Villain Phase.
- **Monster Summoning**: If a monster places a tile or summons another monster during Villain Phase, no additional Encounter is drawn.
- **Treasure from Multiple Kills**: One Treasure card per turn, even if multiple monsters killed.
- **Pit Trap**: Heroes on tile when Pit is drawn must roll to avoid falling in. While in pit, not considered closest to monsters. Roll 10+ at start of Hero Phase to escape.
- **Boulder Trap**: Deals 2 damage to all Heroes on tile when drawn. Activates during Villain Phase: if Heroes present, deal 2 damage; if not, move one tile toward closest Hero.
- **Flying Carpet**: Can move up to 6 tiles; ignores Pit Trap. Only owner can move it. Cannot place trap when using Carpet for movement.
- **Dazed**: Cannot make two moves; only one action (Move or Attack).
- **Curses**: Stack; each requires separate 10+ roll to remove.
- **Villain XP**: Equal to villain’s level.
- **Healing Unconscious Hero**: Yes, via item/spell from another Hero (amount specified by item, not Surge value).
- **Line of Sight**: Not required; open path suffices (cannot fire through walls).
- **Experience Pile**: Shared; any Hero can spend XP to cancel Encounters or Level Up.
