   - A score token (placed on clap-o-meter)  
   - 2 acrobats (1 blue, 1 yellow)  
3. Shuffle Public Demands cards by color; place face-down stacks on board. Reveal the top card of each.  
4. Shuffle Component tiles; place 6 face-up on board.  
5. Shuffle 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Act tiles into separate stacks. Draw (number of players + 1) 1st Act tiles and place face-up.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **3 Circus Acts**, each with **4 phases**:

#### Phase 1: Preparation  
- **1st & 2nd Act**: Starting with the first player, each player takes **one Component tile OR one Act tile** in clockwise order. On their next turn, they take the other type.  
- **3rd Act**: Players take one 3rd Act tile (no Component tiles).  
- After selecting tiles, players retrieve corresponding components from the reserve.  

> *Note: Guest Star tiles only grant the meeple; other components on the tile indicate scoring conditions.*

#### Phase 2: Presentation  
- All components must start outside the circus ring.  
- When all players are ready, music starts (via app/website). All players build simultaneously.  
- Components must:  
  - Be fully inside the circus ring (including entrance).  
  - Be placed on their designated side (beams and barrels may lie flat).  
  - Components on the ground must support at least one other component.  
- Players may use only some of their components.  
- When finished, a player raises hands and says **“Tadaaaa!”**  
- First two to finish claim Speed bonus tokens.  
- When music ends, all building stops immediately.

#### Phase 3: Evaluation  
Players score applause based on:  
1. **Public Demands Cards**:  
   - Score indicated applause if pattern matches exactly (including orientation, angle, and position).  
   - Manufacturing tolerance is allowed (e.g., slight inclines).  
   - Same component can count for multiple cards.  
   - A card can be scored multiple times if at least one element differs.  
   - If a component violates a laying rule, it scores **0**, and **nothing above it scores**.  
   - Extra support components are allowed and do not void scoring.  

2. **Acrobat Meeples**:  
   - **Beginners (Blue)**: 1 applause each if touching the ground.  
   - **Intermediates (Yellow)**: 1 applause each if **not** touching the ground.  
   - **Experts (Red)**: Score applause equal to height in zones (measured with ruler). Only if carrying **no** components.  

3. **Guest Stars** (from 2nd Act onward):  
   - Each has a unique scoring condition:  
     - **Clown**: Knock it down just before evaluation. Score only components still standing afterward.  
     - **Mr. Muscle**: Score ⌊(components carried) / 2⌋ applause.  
     - **Tarzan**: Must be higher than all other components. Can yell “Aaah!” anytime during prep.  
     - **And... Hop! / Clumsy**: Apply only to human components (Acrobat meepees and human Guest Stars).  
     - **Around the Ring / The Great Chain**: “Back of the track” refers to the back of the circus ring (with footprints). Animals must touch the ring while moving around.  

4. **Speed Bonus**:  
   - 1st finisher: 2 applause  
   - 2nd finisher: 1 applause  
   - *Not used in 3rd Act.*

5. **3rd Act Specifics**:  
   - Presentation is **player-by-player**, starting with the player with the **least applause**, then clockwise.  
   - Guest Star applause is **doubled**.  
   - Challenges on 3rd Act tiles must be completed to score.  
   - Some tiles require specific music (indicated by symbol).  

#### Phase 4: End of Act  
- Players keep all components.  
- The player with the **lowest score** becomes the new first player (tie: youngest).  
- New first player:  
  - Discards one Public Demands card of their choice.  
  - Reveals the next card from the same pile.  
- Return remaining tiles and current Scoring tile to the box.  
- Draw 6 new Component tiles and (number of players + 1) tiles for the next Act.  
- Flip next Scoring tile to mark progression.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Exact Matching**: Public Demands require precise replication (position, angle, orientation). Tolerance for manufacturing flaws is allowed.  
- **Component Stacking**:  
  - Ground components must carry at least one other.  
  - Misplayed components (invalid placement) score 0 and invalidate all components above.  
- **Guest Stars**: Unique abilities with specific conditions. Only the meeple is taken; other elements on tile are scoring clues.  
- **Timing**: Music controls time limit (~1.5–2 minutes, depending on track).  
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Acts increase in complexity with Guest Stars and solo performances.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Applause is tracked on the clap-o-meter.  
- After 3rd Act evaluation, the game ends.  
- **Final Scoring Includes**:  
  - Public Demands  
  - Acrobat meeple bonuses  
  - Guest Star bonuses (doubled in 3rd Act)

      - Triggered when:  
        1. Components fall  
        2. Cymbal crash (after 1 minute, then every 20 seconds)  
        3. Player forgets to say “Tadaaaa!”  
      - Max 5 tomatoes per player per act.  
      - End-game:  
        - Most tomatoes: **–3 Applause**  
        - Least tomatoes: **+3 Applause** (shared if tied)  
    - **Awards**:  
      - Each player starts with one Award token.  
      - Must give it to another player **before game ends**, with explanation.  
      - Each Award = **+2 Applause**  
      - If not given: **–4 Applause**  
- **Winner**: Player with most applause. Tie = shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Must all components be used?**  
  A: No. Unused components do not affect scoring.  
- **Q: Can a meeple’s arm position affect beam alignment?**  
  A: Yes, but minor inclines due to manufacturing are tolerated (e.g., arm height ≈ barrel height).  
- **Q: Does “middle of beam on barrel” require exact center?**  
  A: Yes, the midpoint must be supported by the barrel/horse.  
- **Q: Can a barrel straddle two animals?**  
  A: No. Must be fully on one.  
- **Q: Do I score if a challenge condition never occurs?**  
  A: Yes (e.g., “I’m Fine!” scores even with no animals).  
- **Q: Can animals score for “Around the Ring” without touching the ring?**  
  A: No. Must touch the ring while moving around.  
- **Q: Can Tarzan be on a component that’s on top, but not the highest?**  
  A: No. Tarzan must be higher than all other components.  
- **Q: Do speed bonuses apply in 3rd Act?**  
  A: No. They are not awarded.  
- **Q: Can a player win multiple Public Demands with the same setup?**  
  A: Only if at least one element differs (e.g., different meeple, position, orientation).  
- **Q: What if a player knocks down their act during setup?**  
  A: They can rebuild until music starts. No penalty.
