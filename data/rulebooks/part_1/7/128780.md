1. **Lore & Objective**
   - In *Pax Porfiriana*, players are wealthy landowners (Hacendados) in late 19th-century Mexico during the rule of dictator Porfirio Díaz. The goal is to accumulate enough Prestige Points (Loyalty, Outrage, Command, or Revolution) to topple Díaz during one of four Topple events. If no player succeeds by the fourth Topple, the player with the most gold wins.

2. **Components**
   - 207 Play Deck Cards: 4 Topple cards, 29 Headlines, 58 Enterprises, 40 Partners, 23 Black cards, 23 Orange cards, 30 Troops
   - 13 Other Cards: 6 Hacendado cards, 4 Regime cards, 2 Public cards, 1 Play Aid card
   - 60 Disks: 35 white (1 gold), 15 red (5 gold/unrest), 10 blue (10 gold/jail)
   - 75 Cubes: 15 each in five player colors (income, prestige, connection, extortion, speculation)
   - Additional: Bear/Bull discard pile, gold supply

3. **Setup**
   - Separate double-sided cards (Hacendado, Regime, Public).
   - Build the Play Deck: Take 50 cards + 10 per player, divide into 6 stacks, add 1 Topple card to 4 stacks, stack them with non-Topple stacks on top.
   - Deal 12 cards to form the Market (2 rows of 6).
   - Place Public Cards (Teddy Roosevelt, Catholic Church) beside the Market.
   - Place Regime cards with "Pax Porfiriana" on top, color-side up.
   - Shuffle and deal 1 Hacendado card per player, gray side up.
   - Each player gets 15 cubes, placing 2 on their Hacendado.
   - Randomly choose starting player.
   - Starting player gets 4 gold, each next player gets +1 gold (5, 6, 7 in 4p).
   - Remaining cards go to the box.

4. **Gameplay Flow**
   - Players take turns in clockwise order.
   - Each turn has four phases:
     1. **Action Phase**: Perform up to 3 actions (2 if jailed).
     2. **Discard Headlines Phase**: Discard Headline/Topple cards in the 0-cost Market column to the Bear/Bull discard pile (no effect).
     3. **Restore Market Phase**: Slide Market cards left and refill empty spaces from the deck.
     4. **Income Phase**: Gain 1 gold for each of your cubes in play (except on unrest-affected cards).
   - After Income Phase, play passes left.

5. **Core Mechanics**
   - **Actions**:
     - Buy Market Card: Pay cost based on column (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16). Second buy per turn costs 2 actions. Hand limit: 5 cards.
     - Buy Public Card: Pay cost, play immediately (either side), does not count toward hand limit.
     - Play Card: Pay cost to play from hand. Effects depend on card type.
     - Redeploy Troop: Move a troop to another destination, pay connection cost. Removes unrest equal to firepower.
     - Sell Card: Discard a card (in hand or in play) to gain gold equal to current Regime’s Economy value.
     - Buy Land: Spend 2 actions to add an Income Cube to a Ranch or Plantation. Cost = number of cubes already on the card.
     - Upgrade Connection: Pay cost to place a Connection Cube on any enterprise’s connection oval.
     - Police: Pay 3 gold (0 if troop present or during Martial Law) to remove 1 unrest or get out of jail (restores 3rd action).
     - Speculation: Place a cube on a Market card. If opponent buys it, they pay you.
   - **Card Types**:
     - **Enterprise**: Provide income based on Regime (Mines = Mine Value, Banks = Economy).
     - **Partner**: Provide abilities and Prestige Points.
     - **Troop**: Can extort opponents’ enterprises (gain income) or protect your own. Firepower determines combat strength.
     - **Black/Orange Cards**: One-time effects. Victim-Awarded cards go to target’s Grudge Pile as Prestige.
     - **Headline/Topple**: Immediate effect when bought. Topple interrupts game for win check.
   - **Regime**: Determines income values and special effects. Changes via cards. Types:
     - Pax Porfiriana: Mines=2, Economy=3. Loyalty Prestige earns kickbacks.
     - U.S. Intervention: Mines=3, Economy=2. U.S. troops ignore jurisdiction.
     - Martial Law: Mines=2, Economy=2. Police actions cost 0.
     - Anarchy: Mines=1, Economy=1. All troops ignore jurisdiction.
   - **Unrest**: Red disks disable all abilities and income on a card.
   - **Depression**: Triggered by discarding a Bear on another Bear. Mines and Banks lose all income. Players pay 1 gold per card in play or discard it.
   - **Grudge Pile**: Public stack of Victim-Awarded cards. Counts for Prestige.
   - **Private Army**: Troops on flipped Hacendado. Must match faction color. Protects from assassination.

6. **Scoring & End Game**
   - **Topple Sequence**:
     - Triggered when a Topple card is bought.
     - Player chooses orientation (may apply Achilles Heel if matching Regime).
     - Players, starting left of buyer, may:
       - Flip Hacendado to gain Prestige.
       - Discard "During Toppling" cards to modify Diaz’s defense.
       - Play Assassination card (from hand) to kill a flipped Hacendado (cost: 3 + 3 per Private Army troop).
     - **Win Condition**: Player with most Prestige of current Regime type must exceed "Tripartite" score (Diaz’s 2 points + 2 lowest opponents’ points).
     - **Ties**: Most gold, then most income.
   - **Variants**:
     - 2-player: Tripartite = Diaz (2) + Vice President (1) + opponent.
     - 3-player (Diaz Senility): Diaz has 1 point in 1st and 4th Topples.
     - 5-6 player (Iron Hand): Tripartite = Diaz + 2 highest opponents.
   - **End Game**:
     - If 4th Topple is played/discarded with no winner, or all players pass with 4th Topple in Market, player with most gold wins (tiebreaker: income).

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**
   - **Jailed**: Lose 1 action per turn. Pay 3 gold (1 during Martial Law) to get out (immediately regain action).
   - **Sacking**: If an extorted enterprise loses all income cubes, it is Sacked (returned to owner’s hand), troop is discarded or retreated.
   - **Slave Revolt**: If unrest > cubes on a slave enterprise (upside-down Revolution icon), Liberator gains it as Prestige.
   - **Strife**: When triggered, players with both factions in play must discard one entire faction.
   - **Retreat**: If your troop’s enterprise is lost, you may retreat it to your Private Army by flipping Hacendado (if matching faction) and paying cost.
   - **Speculation**: You can move a speculation cube only with a Speculation action. Cubes return if card is bought/discarded.
