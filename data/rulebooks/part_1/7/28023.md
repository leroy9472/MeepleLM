## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Jamaica, players are pirate captains racing clockwise around the island of Jamaica to be the first to return to Port Royal. The goal is to amass the most victory points by the end of the game. Points are scored based on final position on the track, gold (doubloons), treasure cards, and cursed treasure penalties. The game ends when any player reaches Port Royal, after which all players complete the current round.

2. Components  
- Game board depicting a circular island route with spaces for ports, sea, and pirate lairs (skull rocks)  
- 6 player ships and matching 5-hold cargo boards  
- 66 action cards in 6 colors (11 per player)  
- 2 action dice (morning and evening)  
- 1 combat/shortage die (with circle, square, skull, and star symbols)  
- 80 doubloon tokens  
- 45 food tokens  
- 45 gunpowder tokens  
- 12 treasure cards (4 powers, 8 score modifiers)  
- 9 treasure tokens (placed on pirate lairs)  
- Compass marker (indicates Captain)  
- (Optional expansions: Crew, Port Marketplace, Ghost Ship, Solo variants)

3. Setup  
- Place 9 treasure tokens on the 9 pirate lair spaces (skull rocks) on the board.  
- Shuffle 12 treasure cards, randomly select 9, place them facedown beside the navigation box; return 3 to the box unseen.  
- Form a bank of doubloons, food, and gunpowder within reach.  
- Each player receives:  
  - 1 ship and matching cargo board  
  - 1 deck of 11 action cards in their color  
  - 3 doubloons and 3 food tokens (placed in separate holds)  
- Place each player’s ship on Port Royal, facing clockwise.  
- Shuffle each player’s action deck and place it facedown above their holds; draw 3 cards to form starting hand.  
- Randomly select the starting Captain; give them the compass and 2 action dice.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in the following order:  
1. **Dice Roll**: Captain rolls both action dice and assigns one to the morning (left) and one to the evening (right) slot in the navigation box.  
2. **Card Selection**: All players simultaneously choose one action card from their hand and place it facedown on their discard pile.  
3. **Action Resolution**: Starting with the Captain and proceeding clockwise, each player:  
   - Reveals their action card.  
   - Resolves the morning (left) action using the morning die.  
   - Resolves the evening (right) action using the evening die.  
4. **End of Round**:  
   - Each player draws one card to replenish their hand to 3 cards (shuffle discards if deck is empty).  
   - Pass the compass clockwise to the next player, who becomes the new Captain.  
Repeat until a player reaches Port Royal.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Loading Actions** (circle, square, octagon):  
  - Load the number of resources (doubloons, food, gunpowder) shown on the die into an empty hold.  
  - If no empty hold exists, empty a hold containing a different resource type (return to bank), then load.  
  - If all holds contain the same resource type, the action is ignored.  
- **Movement Actions** (green forward / red backward arrows):  
  - Move exactly the number of spaces shown on the die.  
  - If movement ends on a space occupied by another ship, combat occurs before paying space cost.  
  - After movement and combat, pay the cost of the space:  
    - Port: pay doubloons as marked  
    - Sea: pay 1 food per white square  
    - Pirate Lair: free; if treasure token is present, remove it and draw a treasure card  
  - **Shortage Rule**: If unable to pay full cost, pay what you can, then move backward to the first space where you can pay in full. Resolve combat and payment at that space. Use shortage die if needed to determine backward movement path.  
- **Combat**:  
  - Triggered when a player moves into a space occupied by another (except Port Royal).  
  - Attacker chooses how many gunpowder to spend, then rolls combat die. Combat strength = die roll + gunpowder.  
  - Defender does the same.  
  - Higher total wins. Rolling a star is an instant win (defender cannot roll if attacker rolls star).  
  - Winner chooses one:  
    a) Steal contents of one hold from loser  
    b) Steal one treasure card (faceup or facedown)  
    c) Give one cursed treasure to loser  
  - Ties result in no effect.  
- **Treasure Cards**:  
  - **Powers (faceup)**:  
    - Morgan’s Map: Hand size increases to 4  
    - Sarah’s Sabre: Reroll your die or force opponent to reroll (even on star)  
    - Lady Beth: +2 to combat die  
    - 6th Hold: Gain an additional cargo hold  
  - **Score Modifiers (facedown)**:  
    - +3, +5, +7 (treasures)  
    - -2, -3, -4 (cursed treasures)  
  - Treasures can be stolen or given during combat.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End**: When any player reaches Port Royal, they stop immediately and skip any remaining evening action. All other players complete their full turn (including evening actions). The game ends after the round concludes.  
- **Final Score** =  
  - Position value (white number on current space; -5 if on or before the -5 space)  
  + Total doubloons in holds  
  + Sum of all treasure card values (positive or negative)  
- **Winning**: Highest score wins. Tiebreaker: player furthest along wins. If still tied, players share victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you move backward from Port Royal?** Yes, but you must complete a full clockwise circuit to finish.  
- **Can you pay for a space with resources gained in the same turn?** No, resources must be available before paying (e.g., cannot load doubloons in morning to pay for a port in evening).  
- **What happens if you run out of action cards?** Shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck when you need to draw.  
- **Can you fight multiple ships?** No, choose one opponent to fight if multiple are present.  
- **No combat in Port Royal**: Even if ships occupy the same space, no battle occurs.  
- **Stealing 6th Hold**: You gain both the hold and its contents.  
- **Loading same resource type**: If all holds contain the resource you’re loading, action is skipped.  
- **Shortage die results**:  
  - Circle: Move to last Port space  
  - Square: Move to last Sea space  
  - Skull: Move to last Pirate Lair  
  - Star: Stay in place
