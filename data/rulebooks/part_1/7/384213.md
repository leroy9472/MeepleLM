## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
You are a small-town French cheesemaker in the early 20th century, managing a creamery by making, aging, and selling artisanal cheeses. The goal is to earn the most Prestige Points by strategically producing cheese, fulfilling Orders, gathering Resources, and optimizing scoring across four Venues (Festival, Fromagerie, Bistro, Villes). The player with the highest Prestige Points at game end wins.

2. **Components**  
- 4 Board Quadrants  
- 12 Inserts (with sides I/II for different setups)  
- 1 Resource Tile (divided into 4 quadrants: Structures, Livestock, Fruit, Orders)  
- 2 Resource Trays  
- 4 Player Boards  
- 12 Workers (3 per player in 4-player game; types: Soft, Hard, Bleu)  
- 60 Cheese Tokens (15 per player)  
- 36 Structure Tokens  
- 36 Livestock Tokens  
- 36 Fruit Tokens  
- 36 Order Cards  
- 6 Customer Tokens  
- 8 x3/x5 Tokens (for Resource tracking)  
- 32 Structure Tiles (used in advanced mode)  

3. **Setup**  
- Select 4 Inserts matching player count (use side I for first game). Slot into Board quadrants.  
- Assemble the 4 Board quadrants into any configuration, one facing each player.  
- Place Resource Tile in center, random orientation.  
- For 2 players: sit opposite each other; for 4 players: sit in square formation.  
- Place one random Customer Token on each Villes quadrant.  
- Shuffle Order Cards and split roughly in half; place one pile in each Resource Tray.  
- Each player chooses a color: takes 15 Cheese Tokens, 3 Workers (Soft, Hard, Bleu), and attaches Workers to matching Bases.  
- Each player takes a random Player Board.  
- Determine starting Resources: take 2 Resources matching the quadrant to your left, and 1 Resource from the opposite quadrant (based on Resource Tile layout).  

*Advanced Mode – Structure Tiles:*  
- Draft 4 random tiles. Keep 1, pass rest left; repeat until each player has 4 tiles.  
- Place any number of chosen tiles over printed abilities on your Player Board. Return unused tiles.  

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Each turn follows this sequence:  
1. **Retrieve Workers**: Take back any of your Workers currently facing you (i.e., in your current quadrant).  
2. **Simultaneous Actions**: All players act at the same time in their current quadrant. You may perform:  
   - One **Gather Resources** action, and/or  
   - One **Make Cheese** action  
   (in either order).  
3. **Rotate Board**: After all players finish, rotate the board 90° clockwise.  
4. Repeat until game end.

*Note:* In rare deadlock cases (players waiting to see others’ moves), resolve by having players act clockwise starting from the one facing the Structure quadrant of the Resource Tile.

5. **Core Mechanics**  

**Make Cheese**  
- Place a Cheese Token on an empty cheese space in your current quadrant.  
- Cover it with a Worker matching the Cheese Type (Soft, Hard, Bleu).  
- Cheese spaces have Ages:  
  - Bronze (Aged 1 month): Worker returns in 1 turn  
  - Silver (2 months): 2 turns  
  - Gold (3 months): 3 turns  
- Some spaces require a Fruit Token (indicated by icon). Use one from your basket and move it to the spent area.  
- You can only Make Cheese once per turn.  
- In 1–3 player games, some spaces are blocked (marked with ∅).  

**Gather Resources**  
- Place one available Worker on an empty space in the Resource Tile quadrant facing you.  
- Spaces are labeled 1, 2, or 3. Take that many Resources of the type shown in that quadrant:  
  - Structures → Structure Tokens  
  - Livestock → Livestock Tokens  
  - Fruit → Fruit Tokens  
  - Orders → Order Cards  
- Worker stays out for a number of turns equal to the value (1, 2, or 3).  
- You can only Gather Resources once per turn.  
- Worker type (Soft/Hard/Bleu) does not matter.  
- Resources are unlimited; swap with x3/x5 tokens if trays run low.  

**Resource Usage**  

*Fruit*  
- Used to make Fruited Cheeses (must spend 1 Fruit per such cheese).  
- Used to make Jam (by placing Cheese Token on a Jam space; no Worker needed).  
- At game end: score = (number of Fruit used for Fruited Cheeses) × (number used for Jam).  

*Livestock*  
- Kept in your Player Board’s pasture.  
- Use Milking Parlours: spend required Livestock to place a Bonus Cheese (Cheese Token without Worker) of specified type and age in current quadrant.  
- Can use multiple Milking Parlours per turn.  
- Can combine with regular Make Cheese action.  
- If placing Bonus Cheese on Fruited Cheese or Jam space, must use Fruit.  

*Orders*  
- Draw Order Cards and place face-up to the left of your board.  
- Each Order requires a Cheese Type and Age (e.g., Bleu, Gold).  
- When you place a Cheese Token that matches, you may complete the Order immediately (move card to right of board).  
- Only one Order per Cheese Token.  
- Cannot complete Orders retroactively.  
- Bonus Cheeses can fulfill Orders.  
- At game end: score based on number of completed Orders (see scoring rubric).  

*Structures*  
- Gain Structure Tokens via Gather Resources (Structures quadrant).  
- Place on left side of Player Board (holding area).  
- Unlock Structure abilities by spending tokens to fill scaffolding spaces on your board.  
- Abilities vary by board but follow parallel mechanics (e.g., all leftmost abilities do same function, different output).  
- Once unlocked, abilities can be used any time, any number of times.  
- Scoring abilities evaluated at game end.  

6. **Scoring & End Game**  

**Game End Trigger**  
- When any player places their final Cheese Token, they announce game-end.  
- All players complete the current turn. Then game ends.  

**Final Scoring**  
Score Prestige Points from:  
- **Venues** (scored individually):  
  - *Festival*: Score based on size of orthogonally adjacent groups of your Cheese Tokens (diagonals don’t count). Free Sample spaces count as all players’ cheese. Use board’s scoring table. Multiple groups allowed.  
  - *Fromagerie*:  
    - Immediate bonus when placing on shelves with icons:  
      - : gain 2 different Resources  
      - : gain 1 of any Resource  
      - : discard 1 unused Resource to gain any Resource  
    - At game end: score points based on number of different shelves with your cheese (use scoring rubric). Add point bonuses for cheeses on shelves with “+” icons.  
  - *Bistro*:  
    - Each table has 2 plates. Place 2 of your Cheese Tokens on same table to make a pairing.  
    - At game end: score per plate based on number of pairings you made (see rubric).  
      - E.g., 1 pairing → Bronze plate = 1 pt, Silver = 3 pts, Gold = 5 pts.  
  - *Villes*:  
    - Cheese spaces influence regions: Bronze = 1 region, Silver = 2, Gold = 3.  
    - For each region, highest influence takes Customer Token (value depends on player count).  
    - Tie: flip token to “tied” side; tied players score reduced value (0 in 1–2 player games).  

- **Orders**: Score based on number of completed Orders (see rubric).  
- **Fruit**: Score = (Fruited Cheeses made) × (Jams made).  
- **Unused Resources**: 1 Prestige Point per 2 unused Resources (round down).  

**Final Scoring Steps**  
1. Remove all Workers from board.  
2. Score all above categories.  
3. Total Prestige Points.  

**Winning**  
- Highest score wins.  
- Tie: player who placed more Cheese Tokens wins.  
- Still tied: shared victory.  

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can I use a Resource the same turn I gather it?** Yes.  
- **Do Cheese Tokens age fully to score?** Yes — all Cheese Tokens on board count, even if not fully aged.  
- **Can I place Bonus Cheese and regular cheese in same turn?** Yes.  
- **Can I use Structure abilities during first turn?** Only if you can afford them.  
- **What if no cheese space matches an Order Card (Corporation)?** Card is placed on Corporation Board and scored at game end.  
- **What if all Order Cards are used?** Shuffle discard pile to form new deck.
