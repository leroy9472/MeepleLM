# Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
This game is a variant of Coup with modified character actions and additional rules. Players represent powerful figures using influence, deception, and economic power to eliminate opponents. The objective is to be the last player with at least one influence (card) remaining.

2. Components  
- Character cards (including standard Coup roles and possible variants)  
- Coins  
- Player cards (influences)  
- Treasury (coin supply)  

3. Setup  
- Each player receives 2 influence cards and 2 coins (unless otherwise specified).  
- Shuffle remaining cards into a draw deck.  
- Place all coins in the treasury.  
- (Coup: Incorporation variant) Evenly distribute factions among players in alternating order. Players on the same faction cannot target each other with Coup, Assassinate, Steal, or block Foreign Aid while multiple factions exist. Challenges are still allowed. When only one faction remains, all targeting restrictions are lifted.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order. On your turn, you must:  
1. Take exactly one action.  
2. If you have 10 or more coins, you **must** launch a Coup.  
3. Other players may respond with blocks or challenges.  
4. Resolve the action, block, or challenge accordingly.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Actions:**  
- **Income**: Take 1 coin (cannot be blocked).  
- **Foreign Aid**: Take 2 coins. Can be blocked by Duke.  
- **Coup**: Pay 7 coins to launch a Coup (standard).  
  - Pay 6 coins to launch a Coup if you have 2 cards.  
  - Pay 5 coins to launch a Coup if you have 1 card.  
- **Steal**: Take 2 coins from another player. Can be blocked by Captain or Ambassador.  
- **Assassinate**: Pay 3 coins to attempt assassination. Can be blocked by Contessa.  
  - If blocked and not challenged successfully, you do **not** lose the 3 coins.  
- **Exchange**: Swap up to 2 cards with the deck (Ambassador ability).  
- **Joker Aid**: If using Joker rules, take 2 coins or exchange up to 2 cards.  
  - Joker Aid is blocked by Stealing (contextual interpretation).  

**Challenges:**  
- Any player may challenge an action they believe is falsely claimed.  
- If you are challenged and cannot prove the role:  
  - You lose one influence (card).  
  - **Exception**: You may instead pay the challenger 2 coins to avoid losing a card (applies both when challenging others and being challenged).  
- If you are challenged and can prove the role:  
  - The challenger loses one influence.  
  - You return the card and draw a new one (if applicable).  

**Blocks:**  
- Blocks are declared by a target player.  
- A block can itself be challenged.  
- If a block is challenged and the blocker cannot prove the role, they lose an influence.  
- If the block is valid, the action fails and (in the case of Assassinate) the assassin does **not** lose coins.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when only one player has influence cards remaining.  
- That player wins immediately.  
- There is no scoring; victory is determined by elimination.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I use an action if I don’t have the card?  
  A: Yes, but if challenged and you cannot prove it, you lose influence (or pay 2 coins to avoid it).  
- Q: Do I lose coins when I attempt to Assassinate and get blocked?  
  A: No, only if the action resolves (i.e., not blocked or block fails).  
- Q: Can same-faction players challenge each other?  
  A: Yes. Faction rules only restrict Coup, Assassinate, Steal, and blocking Foreign Aid. Challenges are allowed.  
- Q: When does the 10-coin Coup rule trigger?  
  A: At the start of your turn. If you have 10 or more coins, you must perform a Coup and cannot take any other action.
