## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the present day on an isolated island in the Pacific, a mother velociraptor defends her babies from a team of scientists. The scientists aim to either capture three baby raptors or incapacitate the mother by giving her five sleep tokens. The raptors win by either escaping with three babies into the jungle or eliminating all scientists. The game is a tactical, asymmetric duel between two players.

### 2. Components  
- Game board:  
  - 6 square tiles (each with 9 spaces)  
  - 4 L-shaped tiles (each with 3 spaces and one half-space exit)  
- Two board sides: jungle or savannah (chosen at setup)  
- 1 mother raptor figurine  
- 5 baby raptor figurines  
- 10 scientist figurines  
- 10 fire tokens  
- 5 sleep tokens  
- 9 Raptor Action cards  
- 9 Scientist Action cards  
- 2 player aids (one for each side)  
- 3D rocks (placed on non-circle/half-circle spaces)

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose board theme (all tiles jungle or all savannah).  
2. Randomly arrange the 6 square tiles into a 2×3 rectangle.  
3. Randomly place the 4 L-shaped tiles along the short edges of the rectangle.  
4. Place 3D rocks on all spaces without a circle or half-circle.  
5. Raptor player places:  
   - Mother raptor on one of the two central square tiles.  
   - One baby raptor on each remaining tile (one per tile).  
6. Scientist player places:  
   - One scientist on each L-shaped tile (on any space of their choice).  
   - Remaining 6 scientists in reserve next to player aid.  
7. Each player shuffles their 9 Action cards, places the deck face-down, and draws 3 cards.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds as follows:  
1. **Card Selection**: Each player chooses one card from their hand and places it face-down.  
2. **Card Reveal**: Both cards are revealed simultaneously.  
3. **Card Resolution**:  
   - If cards are equal: both are discarded, no effects occur.  
   - If cards differ:  
     - The player with the **lower card** resolves their **card effect first** (if possible).  
     - The player with the **higher card** gains **action points (AP) equal to the difference** between the two card values and uses them for actions.  
   - The player who gains AP **does not** trigger their card's effect.  
4. **Action Phase**: The higher-card player spends AP on actions (see Core Mechanics).  
5. **End of Round**:  
   - Each player draws a new card to replenish hand to 3 cards.  
   - If a player’s draw pile is empty, they shuffle their discard pile to form a new draw pile before drawing.  
   - Played cards are placed face-up in front of each player (visible to opponent).  
6. Play continues to next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action Points (AP)  
- AP are spent by the player who played the higher card.  
- AP can be freely split among active units.  

#### Unit Actions  

**Baby Raptor (active only if upright)**  
- Move 1 space orthogonally (1 AP).  
- Reaching a half-space (exit) on an L-tile = **escape** (removed from board).  

**Mother Raptor**  
- Move any distance in a straight line (1 AP).  
  - Obstacles: rocks, fire tokens, occupied spaces.  
  - If mother has sleep tokens: **lose AP equal to number of sleep tokens** before first move (only once per turn).  
- Kill adjacent scientist (1 AP) → remove scientist.  
- Wake adjacent sleeping baby (1 AP) → set upright.  
  - Cannot wake a baby put to sleep this turn.  
- Put out adjacent fire (1 AP) → remove fire token and **all orthogonally connected** fire tokens.  

**Scientist (active only if upright)**  
- Move 1 space orthogonally (1 AP).  
  - Can move through fire, but **cannot end turn on fire**.  
- Stand up (1 AP) → set upright if frightened.  
  - Cannot stand up same turn they were frightened.  
- Put adjacent baby to sleep (1 AP) → lay figurine down.  
- Capture adjacent sleeping baby (1 AP) → remove from board, place on Scientist player aid.  
- Shoot mother (1 AP) → at any distance in straight line.  
  - Line of sight blocked only by **rocks** or **active scientists**.  
  - Cannot shoot diagonally.  
  - Grants mother **1 sleep token**.  
- **Only one aggressive action per scientist per round** (sleep, capture, shoot).  

#### Card Effects  

**Raptor Cards**  
1. **Mother’s Call & Shuffle**: Move 1 awake baby to mother’s tile (clear path required). Shuffle deck (including this card).  
2. **Disappearance & Observation**: Remove mother. After scientist’s turn, place her back anywhere. Next turn, scientist must reveal card before raptor chooses.  
3. **Fear**: Frighten 1 scientist (lay down). Scientist inactive until stood up (next turn, costs 1 AP).  
4. **Mother’s Call (x2)**: Move up to 2 awake babies to mother’s tile (clear path).  
5. **Recovery (x2)**: Remove 2 sleep tokens from mother OR wake 2 babies OR 1 of each.  
6. **Disappearance & Observation**: Same as card 2.  
7. **Recovery (x3)**: Remove 3 sleep tokens OR wake 3 babies OR mix.  
8. **Fear (x2)**: Frighten up to 2 scientists.  
9. **No effect**  

**Scientist Cards**  
1. **Sleeping Gas & Shuffle**: Put 1 baby to sleep (on same or adjacent tile). Shuffle deck.  
2. **Reinforcements**: Place 1–2 scientists from reserve on edge spaces of **square tiles only** (not L-tiles).  
3. **Jeep (x2)**: Make up to 2 jeep moves (any distance straight line, remove fire tokens on path). Can split between scientists.  
4. **Sleeping Gas (x2)**: Put 1–2 babies to sleep (same/adjacent tile).  
5. **Fire (x2)**: Place 2 fire tokens orthogonally adjacent to a scientist or existing fire.  
6. **Reinforcements**: Same as card 2.  
7. **Fire (x3)**: Place 3 fire tokens (same rules).  
8. **Jeep (x4)**: Make up to 4 jeep moves (same rules).  
9. **No effect**  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when one condition is met:  

**Raptor Wins if**:  
- Three baby raptors have escaped (via half-spaces).  
- No scientists remain on the board.  

**Scientist Wins if**:  
- Mother has **5 sleep tokens** (neutralized).  
- Three baby raptors have been **captured** (not just put to sleep).  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Diagonals**: Never allowed for movement or line of sight.  
- **Same Card Value**: Both discarded, no effect.  
- **Sleep Tokens**: Mother must pay sleep token cost **once per turn** before moving.  
- **Frightened Scientist**: Cannot act until stood up (next turn, costs 1 AP).  
- **Sleeping Baby**: Can only be woken by mother or captured by scientist.  
- **Aggressive Action Limit**: Each scientist limited to **one** per turn (sleep, capture, shoot).  
- **Fire Placement**: Must be orthogonally adjacent to scientist or existing fire (including newly placed).  
- **Jeep Movement**: Removes all fire tokens on path.  
- **Reinforcements**: Can only be placed on **square tiles**, never on L-tiles.  
- **Recovery Effects**: Can be split between mother and babies.  
- **Disappearance**: Mother cannot act while off board. Reappears after scientist’s action phase.
