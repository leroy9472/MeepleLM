### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows these phases in order:  
1. **Upkeep Phase** – Resolve upkeep effects (e.g., Burn, Poison).  
2. **Income Phase** – Gain 1 CP and draw 1 card. *Start Player skips this on their first turn.*  
3. **Main Phase (1)** – Play Upgrade or Main Phase Action cards, or sell cards for 1 CP each.  
4. **Offensive Roll Phase** – Roll dice up to 3 times; activate one Offensive Ability if possible.  
5. **Targeting Roll Phase** – *Only in games with >2 players:* Roll to determine target.  
6. **Defensive Roll Phase** – If an Attack was made, the Defender rolls to activate their Defensive Ability.  
7. **Main Phase (2)** – Same as Main Phase (1).  
8. **Discard Phase** – Sell cards until you have 6 or fewer in hand.
