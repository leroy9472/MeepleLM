### 1. Lore & Objective
In 1775: Rebellion, players represent the major factions of the American Revolutionary War. The British side includes the British Regulars and Loyalist Militia, supported by Hessian mercenaries and Native American allies. The American side includes the Continental Army and Patriot Militia, later supported by French Regulars. The game simulates the struggle for control of the 13 American colonies, Maine, Nova Scotia, and Quebec.

**Objective**: The side that controls the most colonies when the game ends wins. The game ends starting at the end of Round 3 (and each subsequent round) if either side has played both of its Truce Cards. The game can end in a tie.

### 2. Components

### 3. Setup (Campaign Scenario)
1. **Choose Factions**: Each player takes one faction. With fewer than 4 players, one player controls both factions on a side.
2. **Place Starting Units**: Place units as shown on the map in each Area.
3. **Place Control Flags**:
   - British: Delaware, Quebec, Nova Scotia
   - American: Connecticut, Rhode Island
4. **Place Additional Units**:
   - Draw a Turn Marker randomly. The drawn side places 4 units per faction in areas with their side’s units. Return the marker, then the other side does the same.
5. **Create Reinforcement Stockpiles**:
   - Unused units form each faction’s stockpile.
   - Set aside 4 Native American, 12 Hessian, and 10 French units as allied reserves.
6. **Draw Cards**: Each player uses cards 01–12, shuffles, and draws 3.
7. **Place Round Marker**: On Round I of the Round Track.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- **Rounds**: Game lasts 3–8 rounds. Each round ends after all 4 factions take a turn.
- **Turn Order**: At the start of each round, all 4 Turn Markers are placed in the bag. One is drawn per turn, determining the active faction. The order is random each round.
- **Turn Phases (in order)**:
  1. **Event Cards**: Play up to two Event Cards (timing per card text).
  2. **Reinforcements Phase**
  3. **Movement Phase**
  4. **Battle Phase**
  5. **Draw Cards Phase**

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Reinforcements Phase
- Place 4 units from your stockpile into **City Areas** within colonies your side controls.
- If fewer than 4 units available, place all remaining.
- All of your units in the **Fled Units Space** are also placed in City Areas you control.
- If your side controls no colonies, you cannot place reinforcements or fled units.

#### Movement Phase
- Must play **one and only one** Movement Card.
- An **Army** is a group of units in one Area. Must include at least one of the active faction’s units.
- Move up to number of armies equal to icons on card; each army moves up to distance shown.
- Armies stop upon entering an area with enemy units or neutral Native Americans.
- No unit may move more than once per turn.
- **Water Movement**:
  - **Water Movement Card**: Move armies between areas adjacent to same body of water (even if enemy-occupied).
  - **Warship Card** (British Regulars, Continental Army): Move up to 2 armies across any water.
  - **Boat Card** (Loyalist, Patriot Militia): Move two armies of up to 3 units each to one destination.
- **River Crossings** (greyed out): Allow land movement across rivers; mark end of water areas.

#### Battle Phase
- Triggered when opposing units occupy the same area after movement.
- **Defender** (non-active side) rolls first.
- Each faction rolls Battle Dice equal to number of their units (capped at 2 or 3 dice).
- **Results** (applied in order):
  - **Flee**: Move one of your units to Fled Units Space.
  - **Hit**: Opponent removes one of their units to their stockpile.
  - **Command Decision** (blank face): Move one of your units to an adjacent area (not solely enemy-occupied; may include friendly, neutral Native Americans, or upcoming battle areas).
- Armies that entered by water cannot Command Move out by water.
- **Native Americans in Battle**:
  - If both sides have Native American units, they flee one-by-one (equal numbers) until only one side or neither has them.
  - If a side is left with only Native American units, they join the opposing side.

#### Draw Cards Phase
- Discard played Movement and Event Cards.
- If a Truce Card was played, place it face-up beside the board.
- Draw back to 3 cards.
- **No Movement Cards?** If hand has only Event Cards, show hand, reshuffle, and draw 3 new cards.

#### Event Cards
- Up to two may be played per turn.
- Timing specified on card (Reinforcement, Movement, or Battle phase).
- Cards that place units use Reinforcement Stockpile (or Fled Units if empty).
- Truce Cards are Movement Cards; must be played if it's your only Movement Card.
- Allied units (Hessian, French, Native Americans) enter via specific Event Cards.

#### Control
- A **Colony** is controlled if:
  - Your side has units in at least one Area of the colony.
  - No enemy units or **neutral** Native American units are present in any Area of the colony.
- Native Americans are **neutral** if alone in an area. They become **allied** when friendly units enter.
- Control Flags are placed when control is gained; removed if control is lost.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End Check**: Starting at the end of Round 3, and after each round, check if **both Truce Cards** of one or both sides have been played. If yes, game ends.
- **Victory**: The side controlling the most colonies wins.
- **Tie**: Game ends in a tie. (Flavor: “America becomes a southern province of French Canada.”)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Multiple Battles**: Active player chooses resolution order.
- **Command Move into Native Area**: Unit may move into area with neutral Native Americans, who then become allied.
- **Fled Units**: Placed during Reinforcements Phase; cannot be placed if no colonies controlled.
- **Card Refresh**: If no Movement Cards in starting hand or after reshuffle due to all-Event hand, reshuffle and redraw.
- **Allied Unit Placement**: To move allied units (e.g., French), your faction must have a unit in the area to form an army.
- **Truce Card Play**: Inevitable — each faction has one; 8 Movement Cards per deck; must play one per turn.
