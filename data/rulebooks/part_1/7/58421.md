## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Egizia is set in ancient Egypt, where players take on the roles of powerful nobles overseeing construction projects across the kingdom. The goal is to earn the most victory points over five rounds by building monuments, managing resources, and fulfilling secret objectives (Sphinx cards). Victory is achieved through strategic placement of ships along the Nile, efficient crew management, and cooperation in construction efforts.

2. Components  
- 1 game board depicting the Nile with card spaces, round spaces, and building sites  
- 4 player tableaus (with stone and market tracks)  
- 32 ships (8 per player in 4 colors)  
- 96 stones (24 per player)  
- 16 construction crew tiles (4 per player: 3 regular, 1 Joker)  
- 44 grain start cards  
- 56 Nile cards (22x1/2, 22x3/4, 12x5)  
- 29 Sphinx cards  
- 20 grave tiles (12 used, 8 returned to box)  
- 4 player sequence tiles (1–4)  
- Water ring  
- 4 Scarab tiles (for scoring >50)  
- 1d3 and 1d6 dice (used in solo variant)  

3. Setup  
- Place board in center; position water ring on middle irrigation space.  
- Each player:  
  - Takes a tableau and matching ships, stones, and crew tiles.  
  - Places regular crew tiles on space 1, Joker on space 2.  
  - Places 1 stone each on scoring track (player 1 at last place), stone market (top), grain market (top), and stone tracker on tableau.  
  - Receives N+1 stones (Player 1: 2, Player 2: 3, etc.).  
  - Draws 1 Sphinx card and keeps it face-down.  
- Shuffle grave tiles; place 12 randomly on grave spaces, turn over first 4. Return 8 unused to box.  
- Shuffle Sphinx cards into face-down stack. Separate Nile card decks by round (1/2, 3/4, 5).  
- For 2–3 players: cover third building space at each site with unused stone.  
- Solo variant (Cleopatra & Imhotep):  
  - Set up AI player boards with crews as above.  
  - Remove:  
    - “# of players last level achieved” Sphinx cards  
    - “most productive quarry/field” Sphinx cards  
    - “Draw +2 Sphinx cards” river card  
    - Grave tiles 7 and 8  
  - Human player starts with 2 stone and goes first.  
  - Use 1d3 and 1d6 for AI actions.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has 7 phases:  
1. Lay out Nile cards  
2. Place ships along the Nile  
3. Feed construction crews  
4. Produce stones  
5. Build  
6. Bonus for cooperation in building  
7. Determine player order for next round  

Repeat for 5 rounds.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Nile Card Placement**:  
  - 10 cards drawn per round from appropriate deck (1/2 in r1–2, 3/4 in r3–4, 5 in r5).  
  - Cards discarded at end of round if unused.  
- **Ship Placement**:  
  - Players place ships in turn order (1–4).  
  - Ships must be placed downstream of previous placements.  
  - Three space types:  
    - Nile card: take card, place ship, resolve if "immediately"  
    - Round space: resolve action (e.g., Edfu, Thebae)  
    - Building site: reserve spot or speculate if full  
- **Feeding Crews**:  
  - In score order (leader first), compare total crew strength to available grain.  
  - Grain sources: start card, fields (based on water ring), Nile cards.  
  - Penalty per unfed crew: based on position on grain market (1–3 VP loss).  
- **Producing Stones**:  
  - In player order (1–4), advance stone marker by quarry output. Max 25 stones.  
- **Building**:  
  - Process sites top to bottom: Sphinx → Obelisk/Graves → Temple/Pyramid.  
  - At each site, build in order from closest to Nile.  
  - Use 1 crew (plus Joker if desired) to build; pay stones equal to value of action.  
  - Sphinx: draw up to crew strength cards (max 5), keep 0–1, return rest for 1 VP each.  
  - Obelisk: build bottom-up, all bricks supported.  
  - Graves: take tiles in order; flip next when taken.  
  - Pyramid: build left to right; complete rows trigger bonus (most stones = 1 VP per stone, leftmost breaks ties).  
  - Temple: build columns bottom-up, then tops.  
- **Cooperation Bonus**:  
  - After building, score: 1 ship = 1 VP, 2 ships = 3 VP, 3 ships = 6 VP.  
  - Scored in score order (leader first).  
- **Turn Order**:  
  - Reordered by score (lowest first). Ties broken by position on track (later arrival gets lower number).

6. Scoring & End Game  
Final scoring after round 5:  
1. **Sell Stones**: Players with marker on bottom two spaces of stone market sell stones at 2:1 (rounded down).  
2. **Grave Tile Bonus**:  
   - 1–10 total: 2 VP  
   - 11–20: 5 VP  
   - 21+: 9 VP  
3. **Sphinx Cards**: Score all fulfilled conditions. Player may choose order.  
- Winner: highest total. Tie: player furthest forward on scoring track.

Solo Variant AI Rules:  
- AI movement: roll 1d3, move that many empty spaces from last position.  
- AI gains crews normally per circle space.  
- AI takes river cards without using them, scores 1 VP immediately.  
- At Edfu: earns 1/1/2/2/3 VP in rounds 1–5.  
- AI prioritizes lowest crew; uses Joker if tied.  
- Water ring adjustment: roll 1d3 again; left on 1, no change on 2, right on 3.  
- At river end: if 1–2 options, roll until one is valid; if only one option, take it.  
- AI building:  
  - Use max crews (except Sphinx).  
  - At non-Sphinx sites, roll 1d6:  
    - Obelisk: 1–3  
    - Graves: 4–6  
    - Temple: 1–3  
    - Pyramid: 4–5–6  
  - Sphinx: use lowest non-Joker crew, gain that many VP, take 1 Sphinx card (face down).  
- AI end scoring:  
  - 6 VP per Sphinx card (instead of card value)  
  - Bonus: +1 VP per river card from rounds 3–4, +2 VP for round 5 cards  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Feeding Penalty Order**: Always in score order (highest score first).  
- **Unused Nile Cards**: May be played before final scoring.  
- **Sphinx Card Limits**: Max 5 cards per visit; “+2 cards” requires paying for at least one.  
- **Building Zone Limits**: Only one crew (color) per zone per player per round. Joker may be added.  
- **Prospecting**: Only builds if someone ahead fails to build.  
- **Tie Breaking**:  
  - Turn order: later arrival on space gets lower number.  
  - Pyramid row: leftmost stone breaks tie.  
- **Market Bonuses**: Can be triggered multiple times; at bottom, receive bonus per overstep.  
- **Card Combos**: Allowed (e.g., “place upstream” + “place on occupied”).
