## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
King Manuel I has commissioned the finest garden designers to create a magnificent garden for Queen Maria of Aragon. In *Azul: Queen’s Garden*, players compete to design the most beautiful garden by arranging colorful tiles representing plants, trees, and ornamental features.  

**Objective**: Over 4 rounds, score the most victory points (VPs) by placing tiles in patterns on your garden board, scoring during each round, and maximizing endgame bonuses. The player with the highest score wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player takes:  
   - 1 garden board, 1 storage board, 1 fountain board (placed centrally), 3 jokers (placed on storage).  
2. Place scoring board in center; set rotary wheel to starting position.  
3. Place each player’s scoring marker on space 15 of the scoring track.  
4. Place all 108 tiles in the bag.  
5. Shuffle garden expansions and form 4 face-down round stacks:  
   - 2 players: 5 per stack  
   - 3 players: 7 per stack  
   - 4 players: 8 per stack  
6. Place 1st round stack in display area; next 3 stacks above scoring board.  
7. Place top garden expansion of 1st stack in display area; place exactly 4 random tiles on it.  
8. Form supply stack with remaining garden expansions; place shield token on top.  
9. Place first player marker in display area.  
10. Place tower and jokers next to scoring board.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of **three phases**:

#### Phase 1: Player Actions (clockwise)  
Players take turns performing one of four actions until all pass:  
**A) Acquire Tiles & Garden Expansions**  
- Choose **all tiles/expansions of one color** OR **all of one pattern**, regardless of color.  
- Cannot take identical hexagons (same color + pattern); must choose one if duplicates exist.  
- All acquired tiles/expansions go to storage.  
- **Storage limits**: 12 tiles, 2 garden expansions. Cannot exceed limits.  
- **After taking from round stack**:  
  - Move top garden expansion (with any remaining tiles) to display area.  
  - Refill top of stack with 4 random tiles from bag.  
  - If garden expansions in display become empty, flip them face-up (reveal pavilion and hexagon).  

**B) Place a Tile**  
- Select a tile from storage.  
- Pay its placement cost (shown on garden board) by discarding additional tiles/expansions:  
  - All discarded hexagons must be:  
    - Same pattern, different colors, OR  
    - Same color, different patterns.  
  - Jokers can substitute any missing hexagon (but not the tile being placed).  
- Place tile on garden board:  
  - On empty space, adjacent to none OR  
  - Adjacent to one or more tiles, matching **color or pattern** of at least one.  
- **Group Rule**: Cannot create or extend a group (adjacent same color or pattern) that contains two identical hexagons.  
- **Reward**: If tile placement fully surrounds a fountain/statue/bench/pavilion, gain jokers (1–3 depending on element). Place immediately in storage; excess lost if no space.

**C) Place a Garden Expansion**  
- Option 1: Use one from storage (pay cost as with tiles).  
- Option 2: Spend **exactly 6 VPs** (move scoring marker back 6 spaces; score cannot go negative) to take a **face-down** expansion from supply.  
- Place on free expansion area around fountain board, in any orientation.  
- Follow same adjacency rules as tile placement.

**D) Pass**  
- Discard any number of tiles/expansions from storage; score their **negative values** (tree: -1, bird: -2, etc.).  
- First player to pass:  
  - Takes first player marker.  
  - Loses 1 VP (move marker back 1 space).  
- Passed players take no further turns. Phase ends when all pass.

#### Phase 2: Scoring  
- Rotary wheel indicates 3 scoring categories (colors/patterns) for the round.  
- Each player scores:  
  - 1 point per hexagon in garden matching **each** of the 3 categories.  
  - A single hexagon can score up to 3 times (if matches multiple categories).  
  - 1 point per visible **pavilion** in garden.  
- Update scoring markers on track.

#### Phase 3: Prepare Next Round (skip after Round 4)  
- Rotate rotary wheel to next position.  
- Discard all tiles from face-down garden expansions in display to tower.  
- Return all garden expansions in display to supply (face down).  
- Move next round stack to display area.  
- Fill top garden expansion with 4 random tiles from bag.  
- First player places first player marker next to new stack.  
- Next round begins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Hexagon**: A tile or garden expansion space with a specific **color + pattern**.  
- **Group**: Adjacent tiles sharing same **color** OR same **pattern** (but not both). One tile can belong to both a color and pattern group.  
- **Jokers**: Can be used to pay placement costs. Cannot be placed in garden. Discarded jokers return to supply.  
- **Tile Supply**: If bag runs low, refill from tower. If still insufficient, continue with fewer/no tiles.  
- **Storage Management**: Critical for planning acquisitions and placements.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after **Phase 2 of Round 4**.

#### Final Scoring Steps:  
1. **Empty Storage**:  
   - Each remaining **joker**: +1 VP  
   - Each remaining **tile/expansion**: -VP equal to its pattern value (tree: -1, bird: -2, butterfly: -3, flower: -4, lily: -5, tulip: -6)  

2. **Evaluation Track Scoring**:  
   - Evaluation marker moves down track: 6 colors, then 6 patterns.  
   - For each category, score all **groups of 3+** matching hexagons.  
   - Each hexagon in group scores points based on its **pattern value**.  
   - **Bonus**: +6 VP for each group of **6 or more** hexagons.  
   - A hexagon can score multiple times (once per qualifying group).  

3. **Winner**: Highest total score. Tie = shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a tile not adjacent to any others?** Yes, anywhere free.  
- **Can I create a group with two identical hexagons?** No. Even indirectly connected, this is illegal.  
- **Can I use jokers to place a garden expansion?** Yes, same as tiles.  
- **What if I can’t fill a garden expansion with 4 tiles?** Proceed with available tiles.  
- **Can I pass with full storage?** Yes, as long as you can’t or don’t want to act.  
- **Can I place a garden expansion without placing a tile on it immediately?** No. Only when first tile is placed does it enter play.  
- **Can I take a face-up garden expansion?** Yes, if your selection includes its color or pattern.
