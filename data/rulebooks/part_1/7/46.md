## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Medici*, players are merchants competing over three days at a bustling Mediterranean market during the era of the powerful Medici family. Each day, players participate in auctions to acquire goods—cloth, fur, grain, dye, spice, and rare gold—to load onto their ships. The goal is to earn the most money (florins) by the end of the third day. Money is tracked on a circular score track and is both the currency used during bidding and the final victory point total.

Players earn money in two ways each day:  
- **Ship Value Bonus**: Based on the total value of goods loaded (sum of numbers on tiles), with higher totals earning larger payments.  
- **Commodity Dominance**: By shipping the most or second-most of each of the five goods types, tracked on pyramid-shaped commodity tracks. Bonus florins are awarded for reaching top levels on these tracks.

The player with the most florins after three days wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Choose Colors**: Each player selects a color and takes:  
   - 1 large ship mat  
   - 6 player counters in their color  
   - (2-player only) 1 small ship extender, placed adjacent to the large mat to create a 7-space ship  

2. **Place Board**: Position the board in the center.  
   - Place 1 player counter on the bottom (8th) level of each of the five commodity pyramids.  
   - Place one red commodity scoring marker on each red circle around the central crest.  
   - Stack the two blue day counters on the central blue symbol (1 fleur-de-lis on top).  

3. **Set Starting Money**:  
   - 2–4 players: place money marker at 40  
   - 5–6 players: place money marker at 30  

4. **Prepare Commodity Deck**:  
   - Shuffle all 36 tiles.  
   - Remove tiles based on player count:  
     - 2–3 players: remove 18 tiles  
     - 4 players: remove 12 tiles  
     - 5 players: remove 6 tiles  
     - 6 players: use all 36 tiles  
   - The remaining tiles form a face-down draw pile (or go in the bag). Do not look at removed tiles.  

5. **Starting Player**: Randomly choose the first active player. Give them the start player token.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each day consists of alternating **Auction Phases** and ends with a **Scoring Phase**. Repeat for three days.

#### Auction Phase  
On a player’s turn as active player:  
1. **Draw 1–3 Tiles**:  
   - Draw one tile and reveal it.  
   - May draw a second, then a third (max 3).  
   - Cannot skip or reorder; tiles are revealed in order.  
   - Once drawn, tiles must be auctioned as a group.  
   - May draw more tiles than they can carry, but at least one player must be able to bid.  

2. **Auction the Group**:  
   - Bidding starts with the player to the left of the active player.  
   - Each player has **one chance** to bid or pass, in clockwise order.  
   - Bids must exceed the current highest bid.  
   - Active player bids **last**.  
   - Minimum winning bid: **1 florin** (cannot win with 0).  
   - Cannot bid more florins than you have.  

3. **Resolve Auction**:  
   - Highest bidder takes all tiles in the group and places them face-up on their ship.  
   - Pays bid amount by moving money marker **backward** on the track.  
   - If all players pass, the group is discarded.  

4. **Next Player**:  
   - Pass the start player token to the left.  
   - That player begins a new auction.  

#### End of Day Triggers  
The day ends when **one of the following occurs**:  
- All players except one have filled their ships → the last player draws remaining cards from the deck to fill their ship (no cost, no choice).  
- The draw pile is empty → day ends immediately (ships may have empty holds).  

> Players may count remaining tiles in the pile but may not look at them.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Ship Capacity  
- Standard: 5 tile capacity per day (7 in 2-player game with extenders).  
- Cannot bid on a group that would exceed capacity.  
- When ship is full, player is out for the day (cannot bid or start auctions).  

#### Scoring the Day  

**1. Ship Value Bonus**  
- Sum the numbers on all tiles in each ship (gold tile counts for 10).  
- Rank players from highest to lowest total.  
- Award payments based on number of players:  

| Players | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th |  
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|  
| 2      | 20  | 10  | –   | –   | –   | –   |  
| 3      | 30  | 20  | 10  | –   | –   | –   |  
| 4      | 30  | 20  | 10  | 5   | –   | –   |  
| 5      | 30  | 20  | 10  | 5   | 0   | –   |  
| 6      | 30  | 20  | 15  | 10  | 5   | 0   |  

- **Ties**: Add the corresponding place values and divide among tied players (round down).  
  - Example (5 players): Two players tie for 3rd/4th (10 + 5 = 15). 15 ÷ 2 = 7 each.  

**2. Commodity Dominance**  
- For each of the five goods:  
  - Move each player’s counter up their pyramid by the number of that good on their ship.  
  - Gold tile does **not** count toward any commodity.  
- After updating, award:  
  - 1st place: 10 florins  
  - 2nd place: 5 florins (in 2-player game, 2nd gets **0**)  
- **Ties**: Add awards and divide (round down). Even players at the bottom level can tie and earn.  

**3. Pyramid Bonus**  
- Any player whose counter is in the top 3 levels of a commodity pyramid earns:  
  - Level 6 (top): +20 florins  
  - Level 7: +10 florins  
  - Level 8 (bottom): +5 florins  
- Bonuses are **not shared**; all qualifying players receive full bonus even if tied.  
- Counters **stay in place** for future rounds (cumulative).  

> Use red scoring markers to track which commodities have been scored.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- After scoring, remove the top blue day counter.  
- **Next Day Setup**:  
  - Gather all 36 tiles, shuffle, and remove the appropriate number based on player count.  
  - Player with **fewest florins** becomes the new starting player.  
  - In case of tie, choose randomly.  
- Repeat for three days.  
- **End of Game**: After scoring Day 3, the player with the most florins wins.  
- **Tie**: All tied players win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I draw 3 tiles if I can’t carry them?**  
  Yes, as long as at least one other player can carry them.  

- **What if I’m the last player and the deck is empty?**  
  Your ship sails with empty holds. No penalty, but lower value and fewer commodities.  

- **Can I go below 0 florins?**  
  No. You cannot bid more than you have.  

- **Do I have to bid?**  
  No. You may pass at any time.  

- **What happens to discarded tiles?**  
  Set aside with removed tiles. Not used until next day.  

- **Can I win with a bid of 0?**  
  No. Minimum bid to win is 1.  

- **Does the gold tile count for commodity scoring?**  
  No. Only the five regular goods (cloth, fur, etc.) count.  

- **Can I move beyond the top of a commodity track?**  
  No. Maximum is level 1 (top).  

- **Are pyramid bonuses split on ties?**  
  No. Each qualifying player gets the full bonus.  

- **Can I look at the remaining tiles?**  
  No. You may only count how many are left.
