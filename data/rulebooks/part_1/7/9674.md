## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Einfach Genial ("Simply Ingenious") is a strategic tile-placement game designed by Reiner Knizia. Players aim to score points in six colored symbols by placing tiles with matching symbols adjacent on the board. The goal is to maximize your lowest-scoring color. Victory is determined by having the highest such minimum score among all players.

A player wins immediately if they reach 18 in all six colors (rare).

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board with three grids (white, light-grey, dark-grey)  
- 120 game tiles (each showing two colored symbols — either identical or different)  
- 1 tile bag  
- 4 tile trays (racks)  
- 4 score boards (each with six colored tracks from 0 to 18)  
- 24 scoring counters (6 per player, one per color)

### 3. Setup  
- Detach and distribute one score board and one tile tray per player.  
- Place all tiles in the bag and shuffle.  
- Each player draws 6 tiles and places them on their tray, hidden from others.  
- Each player places their 6 scoring counters at "0" on their score board, matching colors.  
- Board usage by player count:  
  - 1–2 players: white grid only  
  - 3 players: white + light-grey grids  
  - 4 players: all three grids  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Starting with the youngest player, turns proceed clockwise. On a turn, a player:

1. **Places one tile** on two adjacent empty spaces on the board.  
2. **Scores points** for both symbols on the tile.  
3. **Draws tiles or exchanges** to restore hand to 6 tiles.

After first round, tiles may be placed anywhere with two adjacent empty spaces.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Tile Placement  
- Tiles must occupy two adjacent empty hexes.  
- Tiles may not be placed outside the active grid or on printed starting symbols.  
- No stacking; tiles must go on empty spaces.  
- Tiles do not need to match adjacent symbols to be placed.  
- First turn: each player must place a tile adjacent to a printed starting symbol. Only one tile may be placed next to each starting symbol.  

#### Scoring  
- Score **both symbols** on the tile, even if identical.  
- For each symbol, count **in five directions** radiating from the tile (excluding the direction toward the other symbol on the tile).  
- Count only **unbroken lines** of matching symbols (including starting symbols).  
- Total number of matching symbols in all valid directions = points scored for that symbol.  
- Advance the corresponding scoring counter by that many points.  
- Maximum per symbol: 18 (in standard play).  

#### Bonus Turn ("Genial")  
- If a scoring counter reaches **exactly 18**, the player calls “GENIAL” and earns a **bonus turn**.  
- The bonus turn is taken **before drawing new tiles**.  
- The player plays another tile from their hand, scores, and may trigger additional bonus turns.  
- Multiple counters reaching 18 in one turn = multiple bonus turns.  
- Bonus turns continue until no new 18s are reached.  
- After all bonus turns, the player draws to replenish their hand to 6.  

#### Tile Exchange  
- A player may **exchange all 6 tiles** only if:  
  - They have **no tile** showing any symbol that currently has the **lowest score** on their board.  
  - If multiple colors tie for lowest, the player must lack **all** such symbols to exchange.  
- To exchange:  
  - Reveal all tiles to opponents.  
  - Set aside current tiles.  
  - Draw 6 new tiles.  
  - Return original tiles to the bag.  
  - Turn ends immediately (no bonus turn or draw).  
- Exchange and bonus turn can occur on same turn.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when **no two adjacent empty spaces** remain in the playable area.  
- Final score for each player = the **lowest value** among their six scoring counters.  
- **Winner**: the player with the highest such minimum score.  
- **Tiebreaker**: if minimum scores are tied, compare next-lowest scores, then next, etc. Color does not matter.  
- **Immediate win**: a player who reaches 18 in all six colors wins instantly.  

#### Team Play (4 players, 2 teams)  
- Teammates sit opposite each other. No communication during play.  
- Use two score boards end-to-end (0–18 → 0–18 = max 36 per color).  
- One player tracks both team members’ scores using one set of counters.  
- Reaching 18 on first board: counter moves to 0 on second board; bonus turn granted.  
- Reaching 18 on second board: another bonus turn, but no further scoring.  
- Tile exchange follows same rules as individual play.  

#### Solo Play  
- Use only white grid.  
- No tile tray: draw and play one tile at a time.  
- Use two score boards end-to-end (max 36 per color).  
- No tile exchange.  
- No bonus turns (even if 18 is reached).  
- Game ends when no legal moves remain.  
- Final score = lowest of the six counters.  
- Maximum possible score: 36, but score is still the lowest counter.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Mismatched placement allowed?** Yes. Tiles need not match adjacent colors. Strategic blocking is valid.  
- **Must tiles connect?** Only on first turn (must be adjacent to starting symbol). After that, any two empty adjacent spaces.  
- **Multiple Genial in one turn?** Yes — one bonus turn per counter reaching 18.  
- **Bonus from bonus tile?** Yes — if a bonus turn causes another counter to reach 18, another bonus turn is earned.  
- **Scoring beyond 18?** In standard play: points over 18 are lost. In solo/team: counter moves to second board; excess points lost.  
- **Exchange again if still no low-color tile?** No — only one exchange per turn. Must wait until next turn.  
- **Can you swap after declaring Genial?** Yes — but only if conditions are met.  
- **Scoring ties:** compare lowest counter, then next-lowest, etc. — not by color.  
- **Solo scoring:** score is still the lowest counter, not sum. Max per color is 36, but final score is min of six.
