## UNFATHOMABLE – Solo and Two-Player Variant Rules (by Inadlecos)

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Unfathomable is a hidden-loyalty, cooperative survival game set aboard a mysterious ocean liner. In these solo and two-player variants, players work against hidden threats and procedural challenges to survive the journey and reach the destination before the ship succumbs to the depths or the traitor sabotages the mission.

The objective remains consistent with the original game: survive the voyage by managing resources, completing skill tests, and reaching the required distance (12 waypoints). Victory conditions are resolved per original rules—either through successful arrival or failure due to resource depletion, passenger loss, or traitor victory.

### 2. Components  
The following components are used in both solo and two-player modes:
- Character standees (selected from the full roster)
- Skill cards (Influence, Lore, Observation, Strength, Will, Treachery)
- Chaos deck
- Loyalty cards (Human, Hybrid)
- Journey marker
- Waypoint/scale cards
- Mythos cards
- Resource trackers (Fuel, Morale, Supplies, Crew)
- Betrayal Ability cards (for Hybrid character)

*Note: Specific character abilities from the base game are assumed present but not detailed here.*

### 3. Setup  

#### Solo Mode:
- Choose **3 characters**; designate one as the starting character.
- Set all resources to **6**, except **Fuel = 7**.
- Place the **journey marker** on the second space of the track (resetting returns it here, though effects may move it to space 1).
- Prepare a loyalty deck: **2 Human cards + 1 Hybrid card**. Do **not** deal loyalty cards at setup.
- All other elements follow original game setup.

#### Two-Player Mode:
- Each player chooses **2 characters** (total of 4).
- Set all resources to **6**, except **Fuel = 7**.
- Place the **journey marker** on the second space.
- Prepare a loyalty deck: **3 Human cards + 1 Hybrid card**. Do **not** deal loyalty cards at setup.
- All other elements follow original game setup.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

#### General Turn Order:
1. Resolve Journey Phase (move journey marker, reveal waypoint/scale card).
2. Resolve two actions per character in turn order.
3. After second scale card is revealed: **Awakening Phase**.
4. End of round: check for end-game triggers.

#### Awakening Phase (Both Modes):
- After resolving the **second scale card**, shuffle and deal one loyalty card face down to each character.
- Reveal each character’s loyalty **at the start of their turn**.
- When the **Hybrid character’s turn begins**, they immediately perform the **"Reveal as Traitor"** action per original rules.
  - This uses one of their two actions.
  - Thereafter, the Hybrid acts under traitor rules (see Core Mechanics).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Resolving Skill Tests:
- The active player (controlling characters) chooses which character contributes which skill card.
- Add:
  - **Two cards from the Chaos deck**
  - **One card from the Treachery skill deck** (simulates sabotage)
- Total cards = player contributions + 3 random (chaos ×2 + treachery ×1)
- Resolve test normally (sum values, compare to difficulty).

#### Hybrid/Traitor Behavior (Solo Mode Only – AI Control):
Once revealed, the Hybrid character follows strict AI rules per turn (two actions, none repeated):

1. **Use Betrayal Ability**: Spend an action to play the highest-value betrayal ability card that has an effect. If none, use next lowest with an effect.
2. **Attack Human**: If a human is in the same space, spend an action to attack them.
3. **Defeat Passenger**: If a passenger is in the same space, spend an action to defeat it.
4. **Move** (if no other action applies), in this priority:
   - To space with **most Depths** (tie: random)
   - Else, to space with **most Passengers** (tie: random)
   - Else, to space with **most Characters** (tie: random)
5. **If in Dungeon**:
   - Must first spend an action to **Exit Dungeon** by discarding **12 cards** (starting with lowest value).
   - Then move to **Boiler Room**.

*Note: In two-player mode, the player who controls the Hybrid plays it freely after reveal.*

#### Journey Completion Rule (Both Modes):
- After **four scale/waypoint cards** have been revealed:
  - If total distance traveled is **less than 12**, draw and resolve **one Mythos card per missing waypoint**.
  - Captain is considered active player during resolution.
- After this, the game proceeds as if **12 waypoints** were reached.
- The **journey marker need only reach the Arrival space one final time** to trigger endgame.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- End game and victory/loss conditions follow **original rules**.
- Players win or lose collectively (unless Hybrid is revealed, in which case traitor may win alone).
- In two-player mode:
  - One player controls the **Hybrid** after reveal.
  - The other controls the **remaining loyal characters**.
  - They play competitively from that point.

---

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: When exactly is the Awakening Phase triggered?**  
A: After resolving the **second scale card** (i.e., after the second Journey Phase that reveals a scale card).

**Q: Are loyalty cards shuffled back if not all are used?**  
A: Not specified; assume unused loyalty cards remain out of play.

**Q: Can the Hybrid repeat actions?**  
A: No. The rules state: “none of them may be repeated” per turn.

**Q: Who resolves Mythos cards when distance is short?**  
A: The **Captain** acts as active player during resolution.

**Q: What happens if the Hybrid is revealed early?**  
A: They immediately perform the “reveal as traitor” action as their first action, then follow traitor rules for remainder of game.
