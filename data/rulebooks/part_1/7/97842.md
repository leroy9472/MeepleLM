## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In accordance with your late uncle’s eccentric last will, your goal is to spend your inheritance as quickly as possible. The winner is the first to declare bankruptcy—having no money and no properties—or, if no one goes bankrupt, the player with the least wealth (cash plus property value) by the end of Round 7. The game celebrates reckless extravagance over prudent saving.

End Game Triggers:  
- A player declares bankruptcy (must own no money, no properties, and may go into debt).  
- End of Round 7 (whichever comes first).

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has 5 phases:

1. **Setup**  
   - Deal cards to offering board spaces based on round and board layout.  
   - (Round 1 only): After setup, each player discards down to 2 cards from initial hand.

2. **Planning**  
   - Starting player chooses a plan first, then clockwise.  
   - Each plan determines:  
     - Number of cards drawn (immediately, without peeking).  
     - Number of errand boys.  
     - Number of actions.  
     - Turn order for the round (leftmost plan goes first).  
   - Players draw cards from any combination of the 4 regular decks (Events, Helpers & Expenses, Properties, Companions).  
   - (2-player variant): Starting player blocks one plan with a dummy marker; second player blocks another, then chooses; starting player chooses last.

3. **Errands**  
   - Players take turns placing errand boys (leftmost plan first).  
   - Each player places one errand boy per available slot (1 or 2, depending on plan).  
   - Errand options:  
     - **Card Offering**: Take one visible card from the offering board.  
       - On 2–3 player board, some spaces have 3 cards: first player takes any of 3, second takes from remaining 2, third card is lost.  
     - **Player Board Extension**: Take one extension (if available) and attach to right of your board.  
     - **Property Market**: Rearrange the 4 modifier tokens in any order.  
     - **Unknown Card**: Draw 1 card from any regular deck (only once per player per round).  
     - **Opera**: Spend 2£ immediately.  
     - **Special Cards**: Take one from the special deck (if available).  
   - Companion Wild Card is a unique offering; taking it gives a reusable slate-bordered card.

4. **Actions**  
   - Players take turns in planning order (leftmost first).  
   - Use action counter to track available actions.  
   - Play and activate cards:  
     - **White-bordered (Events)**: Use once, pay cost, discard. May use companion cards to increase spending.  
     - **Black-bordered (Helpers, Expenses, Properties)**: Play to board (uses actions and possibly money).  
       - **Helpers**: Provide ongoing abilities.  
       - **Expenses**: Activate to spend money each round (no action needed if specified).  
       - **Properties**: Must be maintained (activated) to avoid depreciation (except farms).  
     - **Slate-bordered (Companions)**: Used with white or black cards.  
       - With white cards: discard to increase cost.  
       - With black cards: discard to place companion token (uses 1 action per token).  
     - **Companion Wild Card**: Can substitute for any companion card; must be returned to offering board if unused by end of round.  
     - **Special Cards**: Powerful effects; discard after use (return to box).  
   - Cards may grant extra actions, draw cards, or allow free actions.

5. **End of Round**  
   - **Discard Down to 2**: Keep max 2 cards. Companion Wild Cards cannot be kept.  
   - **Depreciate Properties**: Any property not maintained (activated) loses 1 value level (except farms, which do not depreciate).  
   - **Reset Cards**: Slide activated black-bordered cards back up (cover checkmark).  
   - **Clean Up Offering Board**: Discard all remaining offering cards (Special Cards go back to box).  
   - **Return Markers & Figures**: Return planning markers, errand boys, action counters.  
   - **Move Round Counter**: Advance to next round.  
   - **Pass Starting Player Marker**: Clockwise to next player.  
   - (With Getting Sacked expansion): Distribute income based on employment card.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Spending Money**: You cannot go into debt while owning properties. Once property-free, you may spend beyond zero to go into debt.  
- **Card Types**:  
  - White-bordered: One-time use, discard after.  
  - Black-bordered: Play to board, may be activated.  
  - Slate-bordered: Companion cards, used in conjunction.  
  - Special: High-impact, single-use.  
  - Wild: Substitute for any companion.  
- **Turn Order**: Based on planning phase placement (leftmost acts first in errands and actions).  
- **Property Mechanics**:  
  - Buy: 1 action + adjusted price (market modifier).  
  - Maintain: 1 action + cost to prevent depreciation.  
  - Sell: 1 action, receive money based on current value + market modifier.  
- **Helper Effects**: Include extra actions, draw bonuses, reduced action costs, spending boosts.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when:  
  - A player declares bankruptcy (no money, no properties, may be in debt), OR  
  - End of Round 7.  
- **Winner**:  
  - Player with largest debt (negative money).  
  - If no debt: player with least total wealth (cash + property value).  
    - Property value = current marker value + 5£ (helpers and modifiers not counted).  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player who chose the leftmost plan in the final round.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I go into debt before selling all properties?**  
  No. You must sell all properties first. Only then can you spend beyond zero.  
- **Can I discard a property to make space?**  
  No. Properties must be sold on the market.  
- **Can I use a Helper ability if the card is not activated?**  
  Yes. The lower ability (privilege) is always active.  
- **Can I use multiple companions on one event?**  
  Yes, if the event allows multiple types. Discard each companion card used.  
- **What happens to Companion Wild Card if unused?**  
  Return it to the offering board at end of round.  
- **Can I use a helper that gives extra actions to play white-bordered cards only?**  
  Yes. Some helpers grant actions restricted to white-bordered cards.  
- **Can I rearrange property market tokens multiple times?**  
  Only once per round—when you send an errand boy there.  
- **Do farms depreciate?**  
  No. But they can be maintained (costs money) and do not lose value.
