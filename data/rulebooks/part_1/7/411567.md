## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are members of a heist crew attempting to pull off a high-stakes robbery. Each player takes on a unique role with special abilities that affect information sharing, card manipulation, and hand outcomes. The objective is to successfully complete a heist by forming the strongest poker hand while navigating challenges that may disrupt plans or reveal secrets.

A heist fails if any Challenge Card condition causes a collective guess to be incorrect during the Showdown.

### 2. Components  
- Standard 52-card deck  
- Pocket cards (player-held cards)  
- Chips in multiple colors:  
  - White chips (1-star and higher-value)  
  - Orange chips  
- Challenge Cards (10)  
- Specialist Cards (10)

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose one Challenge Card and one Specialist Card to use for the game.  
2. Shuffle the deck.  
3. Deal pocket cards based on the active cards:  
   - Normally: 2 pocket cards per player  
   - With **Security Cameras** (Challenge #10): Deal 3 pocket cards per player  
4. Apply effects that trigger "after dealing pocket cards" in numerical order if multiple are active:  
   - **Quick Access** (#1): Do not distribute white chips  
   - **Investor** (#3): Each player announces number of face cards (J, Q, K) they hold  
   - **Math Whiz** (#8): Each player announces sum of card values (J/Q/K = 10, A = 11)  
   - **Mastermind** (#4): Choose a card value (2–A); each player reveals how many of that value they have  
   - **Coordinator** (#6): Each player passes one pocket card to the player on their left  
   - **Hacker** (#5): One player draws an extra card, then discards one  
   - **Con Artist** (#9): Shuffle and redistribute all pocket cards randomly  
   - **Jack** (#7): One player replaces one of their pocket cards with a wild J (no suit)  
5. Distribute chips according to round and active Challenge Cards.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds over four rounds:

#### Round 1: Pre-Flop  
- Players may use abilities from Specialist Cards.  
- White chips are distributed unless prevented by **Quick Access**.  
- If **Blackout** is active: discard all previous chips (only relevant in multi-round games).  
- If **Noise Sensors** or **Ventilation Shaft** are active: flip designated chips (1-star or highest-value) to dark side; these become locked and cannot change ownership.

#### Round 2: Flop  
- Reveal community cards (Flop).  
- Check **Motion Detector** (#3): If any Flop card is J, Q, or K → player with white 1-star chip discards and redraws pocket cards.  
- Check **Laser Tripwires** (#7): If *none* of the Flop cards is J, Q, or K → player with highest-value white chip discards and redraws pocket cards.  
- Distribute white chips unless **Quick Access** is active.  
- Apply **Blackout** if active: discard chips from prior rounds.  
- Flip chips as required by **Noise Sensors** or **Ventilation Shaft**.

#### Round 3: Turn  
- Distribute white/orange chips as normal unless modified:  
  - **Hasty Getaway** (#5): Do *not* distribute orange chips after this round  
- Apply **Blackout** if active.  
- Flip chips as needed.

#### Round 4: Showdown  
- Final hands are revealed.  
- Before revealing, check active Challenge Cards:  
  - **Retina Scan** (#4): All other players collectively guess one of the revealed hand’s pocket cards (rank only, 2–A). If incorrect → heist fails.  
  - **Fingerprint Scan** (#9): All others collectively guess the hand’s ranking (e.g., “Straight”, “Full House”, “Royal Flush”). If incorrect → heist fails.  
- Resolve winner based on standard poker hand rankings, modified by **Muscle** if active.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Chip Mechanics  
- **White Chips**: Typically distributed each round; represent influence or control.  
- **Orange Chips**: Distributed after Turn unless **Hasty Getaway** is active.  
- **Locked Chips** (dark side):  
  - **Noise Sensors**: 1-star white chips for Rounds 1–3 are flipped and locked.  
  - **Ventilation Shaft**: Highest-value chips for Rounds 1–3 are flipped and locked.  
- **Blackout**: At start of each round, discard all chips from previous rounds.

#### Card Mechanics  
- **Pocket Cards**: Initial hand; modified by certain Specialist Cards.  
- **Community Cards**: Flop and Turn cards affect challenge triggers.  
- **Wild J** (**Jack** Specialist): A joker-style card (rank J, no suit) used to replace one pocket card.

#### Information Sharing  
- **Informant**: One player shows one pocket card to another.  
- **Getaway Driver**: One player reveals current hand strength (e.g., “Two Pair”).  
- **Investor**: All announce number of face cards held.  
- **Math Whiz**: All announce total point value of cards.  
- **Mastermind**: All announce count of a chosen rank.

#### Hand Resolution  
- Standard poker hand rankings apply.  
- **Muscle**: One player’s hand beats all others of the same rank (e.g., their Two Pair beats another’s Two Pair).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is no traditional scoring system.  
- The game ends at the Showdown.  
- A **heist succeeds** if:  
  - The final hand is revealed  
  - And all collective guesses (from **Retina Scan** or **Fingerprint Scan**) are correct  
- A **heist fails** if:  
  - Any collective guess is incorrect  
- Victory is determined by successful completion of the heist, not individual hand strength.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: What happens if both Motion Detector and Laser Tripwires trigger?**  
A: Only one can trigger. If *any* Flop card is J/Q/K → Motion Detector activates. If *none* are → Laser Tripwires activates. They are mutually exclusive.

**Q: Who chooses which player uses Hacker, Getaway Driver, etc.?**  
A: Unless specified, the group chooses one player to activate the ability.

**Q: Can the wild J from Jack card be discarded?**  
A: Yes, it can be discarded normally (e.g., via Hacker or forced redraw).

**Q: Does Con Artist override other post-deal effects?**  
A: Yes. If **Con Artist** is active, all pocket cards are shuffled and redistributed, making earlier announcements (Investor, Math Whiz, etc.) based on original cards irrelevant.

**Q: When exactly are guesses made for Retina Scan and Fingerprint Scan?**  
A: Immediately before the final hand is revealed. Guesses must be unanimous or jointly decided by all non-hand players.

**Q: Can multiple Challenge or Specialist Cards be used?**  
A: The documents do not specify; assume one of each type is used unless house rules allow more.
