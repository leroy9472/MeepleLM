# Creature Comforts — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In **Creature Comforts**, players are forest animal families preparing their homes for winter in the village of Maple Valley. Over the course of eight months (or six in a short game), players gather resources, craft Comforts, build Improvements, and adapt to seasonal changes. The goal is to create the coziest, most comfortable home by scoring the most Victory Points (VP) through crafted Comforts, built Improvements, empty Cottage slots, and leftover resources.

The game ends when the final Valley cards are discarded and winter arrives. The player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, all tied players win together.

### 3. Setup

#### General Setup
1. Place the game board. Insert the River Dial randomly (aligning with gaps in the surrounding ring) and place the Hilltop tile.
2. Prepare Valley card stacks:
   - Forest and Meadow stacks each: Spring (bottom), Summer, Fall (top). Shuffle within each season.
   - Flip stacks face down so only top (Spring) card is visible.
3. Create supply piles:
   - Goods: Wood, Stone, Fruit, Mushrooms, Yarn, Grain
   - Non-Goods: Coins, Stories, Lesson Learned tokens (keep separate)
4. Comfort Cards: Shuffle into a face-down deck. Reveal 4 face-up in the Owl’s Nest.
5. Improvement Cards: Shuffle into a face-down deck. Reveal 6 face-up in the Workshop ladder (slots 1–6).
   - Place Improvement tokens (Wheelbarrows, Almanacs) nearby.
6. Traveler Cards: Shuffle face down and place in the Inn.
7. Determine Early Bird (starting player). Give them:
   - The Worm token
   - The 4 Village dice
   - Bonus Coin if applicable (see player count chart on p.5)

#### Player Setup
Each player:
- Chooses a family (color) and takes:
  - 1 Home Board
  - 4 Workers
  - 4 Cottages
  - 2 Family Dice
- Places all 4 Cottages on Cottage slots of their Home Board.
- Draws 3 Comfort Cards, keeps 2 (hand is secret), discards 1 to a shared face-up discard pile.
- Receives starting Coin if applicable (based on player count and chart).

> Optional: For a **short game** (6 months), remove 1 random Spring and 1 random Summer card from both Forest and Meadow stacks before setup.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game plays over **8 months** (6 in short game), each consisting of **6 steps**:

#### Step 1: New Traveler
- Flip the top Traveler card face up in the Inn.
- Read the card aloud.
- If it has an **"Immediately"** power, resolve it now (e.g., Canada Lynx: all players give 2 different Goods to the player on their left).

#### Step 2: Family Dice
- All players roll their **2 Family dice** and place them on their Home Board.
- Values are locked for the month.

#### Step 3: Placement
- All players simultaneously place up to 4 Workers on locations (1 per location per player).
- Multiple players may occupy the same location.
- Workers may be moved freely until all players are satisfied.
- Placement order does not matter except in:
  - **Owl’s Nest**: First player to resolve may take desired Comforts.
  - **Workshop**: First player may build desired Improvements.

#### Step 4: Village Dice
- Early Bird rolls the **4 Village dice** and places them on the Hilltop tile.
- Values are locked for the month.

#### Step 5: Player Turns
Starting with the Early Bird and proceeding clockwise, each player takes a turn in this order:

**A. Add Family Dice to Pool**  
- Place your 2 Family dice onto the Hilltop. You now have a pool of 6 dice (2 Family + 4 Village).

**B. Assign Dice**  
- Assign dice from the pool to your Workers’ locations.
- You may also assign **Family dice** (not Village dice) to **Glades** (if any exist).
- You may spend **Lesson Learned tokens** to modify die values by +1 or –1.
  - Multiple tokens may be used on one die.
  - Cannot modify below 1 or above 6.
  - Cannot change a blank face (if any) into a number or vice versa.
  - Place token beside die with + or – side up; do not alter die.

**C. Resolve Locations & Glades**  
- Resolve each location/Glade where you've met the requirements.
- Resolve in any order.
- Take back your **Worker** and any **Family dice** assigned there.
- Leave **Village dice** in place for next players.

**D. Unresolved Workers**  
- Bring home any Workers not resolved.
- Gain **1 Lesson Learned token** per unresolved Worker.

**E. Craft Comforts**  
- You may craft **any number** of Comforts from your hand.
- Pay exact cost (Goods, Coins, Stories) as shown on card.
- Return resources to supply.
- Place crafted Comfort face up near your Home.
- You may freely move Goods between your Home and Comforts that allow storage until final scoring.

**F. Clean Up Turn**  
- Return your Family dice to your Home Board (if not already).
- Carefully return all **Village dice** to the Hilltop (do not change values).
- Discard any spent Lesson Learned tokens to the supply.
- If you have **more than 3 Comfort cards in hand**, discard down to 3 (choose which).

Then pass to next player.

#### Step 6: Upkeep
After all players have taken turns:
1. **End of Month Traveler Power**: If the current Traveler has a monthly effect, resolve it now.
2. **Discard Valley Cards**:
   - Discard the top Forest and Meadow cards.
   - Reveal the next cards in each stack.
   - If no cards remain, **winter has arrived** → go to **Scoring**.
3. **Rotate River Dial** one notch clockwise.
4. **Owl’s Nest Refresh**:
   - Discard the leftmost Comfort.
   - Shift remaining cards left.
   - Deal a new Comfort into the rightmost slot.
5. **Workshop Refresh**:
   - Discard the bottom (slot 6) Improvement.
   - Shift remaining Improvements down.
   - Deal a new one into the top slot.
6. **Discard Traveler** from the Inn.
7. **Pass the Worm** clockwise → new Early Bird.
8. New Early Bird takes the Village dice for next month.
9. Begin next month with **Step 1: New Traveler**.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Locations
Each location has specific dice requirements and rewards.

| Location | Requirements & Effects |
|--------|------------------------|
| **The Valley** | Two Forest and two Meadow locations active per month. Seasonal availability: <br>– Spring: No Grain<br>– Summer: No Mushrooms<br>– Fall: No Yarn<br><br>Examples of possible actions:<br>- One die ≤3 → 1 Wood<br>- Two dice summing to ≤5 → 2 Wood, 2 Mushrooms<br>- Three consecutive dice → 2 Stories, 1 Coin<br>- Exactly 5 and 6 → 1 Fruit, 1 Yarn |
| **The River** | Uses River Dial. Three sections with changing die requirements:<br>- Match one of three shown → 1 Stone<br>- Match one of two shown → 2 Stone<br>- Match one specific die → 1 Stone + 1 Coin |
| **The Owl’s Nest** | Two options:<br>1. Assign any die → choose 1 visible Comfort from the 4 displayed.<br>   - Slide cards left, refill rightmost from deck.<br>2. Assign a die → draw 1 or 2 Comforts blindly:<br>   - Die 1–4: draw 1 card<br>   - Die 5–6: draw 2 cards |
| **The Workshop** | Assign one die → may build an Improvement in slot 1 through (die value).<br>- Must have at least 1 Cottage left.<br>- Pay full resource cost.<br>- Take Improvement, place lowest remaining Cottage on it.<br>- Slide higher Improvements down, refill top slot.<br>- Some Improvements grant tokens (Almanac, Wheelbarrow).<br>- Some become **Glades** (placed above board). |
| **The Inn** | Benefit depends on assigned die and current Traveler.<br>- Green arrow with number: perform action up to that many times.<br>- Green arrow with 🎲 symbol: perform up to die value times.<br>- No arrow: perform once.<br>- Example: Black Bear lets you spend 1 Fruit for 1 Good, up to die value times. |
| **The Market** | Assign any die → perform any number of trades:<br>- 1 Coin → 1 Good<br>- 2 matching Goods → 1 any Good<br>- 3 any Goods → 1 Coin |
| **Glades** | Built from certain Improvements. No worker placement.<br>- On your turn, assign **1 Family die per Glade** (not Village dice).<br>- Resolve effect as described on Glade card.<br>- Often benefits both you and the Glade owner. |

#### Goods Symbol
- The symbol 🟦 means **any Good** (Wood, Stone, Fruit, Mushrooms, Yarn, Grain).
- Two matching Goods: 🟦🟦 (same type)
- Two different Goods: 🟦🟥 (different types)

#### Lesson Learned Tokens
- Used to modify **one die** by +1 or –1 per token.
- Can stack multiple tokens on one die.
- Cannot exceed 6 or go below 1.
- Cannot change blank faces (if any).
- Gained when:
  - Worker is unresolved at end of turn (1 per worker)
  - Some Improvements or Travelers

#### Cottages
- You start with 4 Cottages on your Home Board.
- Each time you build an Improvement, you must place one Cottage from your Home onto it.
- You can build at most 4 Improvements.
- At scoring, you score the VP value of **empty** Cottage slots on your Home Board.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

**Q: Can I assign Village dice to Glades?**  
A: No. Only **Family dice** can be assigned to Glades.

**Q: Can I reassign dice after resolving a location?**  
A: No. Once you resolve a location, the dice assigned there (especially Village dice) are locked in place. You must finalize all assignments before resolving.

**Q: What happens if the Comfort deck runs out?**  
A: Shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck. If no discard pile, no more draws.

**Q: Can I craft a Comfort I don’t have in hand?**  
A: No. You must hold the Comfort card to craft it.

**Q: Can I use a Lesson Learned token gained this turn to modify dice?**  
A: No. You gain Lesson Learned tokens **after** resolving, so they cannot be used until a future month.

**Q: Do Glades count as locations for worker placement?**  
A: No. Workers cannot be placed on Glades during Placement.

**Q: Can I build the same Improvement twice?**  
A: No. You may not build more than one of the same Improvement.

**Q: Can I move resources between Comforts during the game?**  
A: Yes. You may freely move stored resources between your Home and Comforts until final scoring.
