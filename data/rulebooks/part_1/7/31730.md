## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the role of investors and railroad barons during the late 19th-century American railroad expansion, racing to connect eastern rail lines to Chicago. The goal is to maximize personal wealth through strategic investment in railroad companies and influencing their development. The player with the most cash at the end of the game wins. Shares themselves do not count toward victory.

  - 24 green (NYC)  
  - 11 black (Wabash)

### 3. Setup  
#### Board Setup  
- Place one locomotive of each color (except black) on its starting hex.  
- Place remaining locomotives and shares on their respective charters.  
- Place income markers on the income track at their starting positions (PRR:7, B&O:6, C&O:5, NYC:8). Wabash marker is set aside.  
- Place development houses:  
  - 1 on Detroit (1), Wheeling (3), Pittsburgh (4) on the Industrial City track  
  - 20 in general supply on the board  
- Set all three action dials to "Start" (green).  

#### Player Setup  
- Choose a banker. Distribute $120 total among players:  
  - 2 players: $60 each  
  - 3 players: $40 each  
  - 4 players: $30 each  
  - 5 players: $24 each  
  - 6 players: $20 each  
- Money is kept open and visible.  
- Conduct initial share auction in order: PRR ($7 min), B&O ($6), C&O ($5), NYC ($8).  
  - Starting bidder chosen randomly (or oldest player).  
  - Bidding proceeds clockwise; players may bid or pass. Once passed, cannot re-enter.  
  - Highest bidder pays amount to the company's charter (not the bank) and takes the share.  
  - If no bids, starting bidder gets the share for free.  
  - Winner becomes starting bidder for next auction.  
- The player who wins the PRR share begins the game.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn:  
1. **Choose an action**: Auction, Expand Route, or Develop.  
2. **Move the corresponding indicator** one space to the right.  
3. **Take (or decline) the action**. Players may choose an action but perform nothing.  
4. **Check for Dividend Phase**: If two indicators are in the red, a Dividend Phase occurs immediately **before** the next player's turn.  
   - Pay dividends to all shareholders  
   - Reset all indicators to Start  
   - Advance Detroit one space on Industrial City track (increasing income of companies there by 1)  
5. Play continues clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action A: Auction a Share  
- May auction any available share (Wabash excluded until Chicago reached).  
- **Minimum bid** = Current company income ÷ (number of shares already sold + 1), **rounded up**.  
- Active player starts bidding; clockwise bidding follows with increasing offers.  
- Highest bidder pays amount to the **company charter** and takes the share.  
- If all pass, share remains unsold on charter.  

#### Action B: Expand Route  
- Player must own **at least one share** in the company being expanded.  
- May expand up to **3 connected hexes**. Branching allowed.  
- New hexes must connect to existing network of the same company.  
- Cannot expand into start hexes (except Fort Wayne, which is also a city).  
- **Placement limits**:  
  - Only one locomotive total per Forest or Mountain hex (any company)  
  - Multiple companies may occupy City, Industrial, and Plain hexes (one per company)  
- **Cost** = Red number in hex × total number of locomotives in hex (including new one)  
  - Paid from **company charter** to the bank  
  - Company cannot spend more than it has (no loans)  
- **Income increase upon placement**:  
  - City/Mountain hex: + black number in train symbol  
  - If developed (has house): + additional number in house symbol  
  - Industrial City (Detroit, Wheeling, Pittsburgh): + current value on Industrial City track  
  - Forest/Plain: no income increase  
- If a locomotive is placed in **Chicago**, trigger **Chicago Phase** after placements.  

#### Action C: Develop  
- Can develop a hex if **at least one locomotive** (any company) is present.  
- **Cannot develop**:  
  - Start hexes (except Fort Wayne)  
  - Chicago  
  - Plains  
- **Development options**:  
  - **City/Mountain/Forest**: Place one house from general supply. Each hex may be developed only once.  
    - City/Mountain: All companies present increase income by number in house symbol.  
    - Forest: Company present gains **$2 to its charter** (income unchanged).  
  - **Industrial City (Wheeling, Pittsburgh)**: Move marker one space right on Industrial City track.  
    - All companies present increase income by **difference** between old and new track values (1 for Wheeling, 2 for Pittsburgh).  
  - **Detroit**: Cannot be developed by players. Automatically advances one space after each Dividend Phase.  

#### Chicago Phase  
Triggered when **any company** places a locomotive in Chicago.  
1. Company increases income as normal.  
2. **Immediate dividend** paid to shareholders of that company only:  
   - Amount = Company income ÷ shares sold, **rounded up**  
   - Paid from bank  
3. **If this is the first time Chicago is reached**:  
   - Open Wabash Railroad  
     - Place black locomotive on Fort Wayne  
     - Set Wabash income marker to 1 (or 3 if Fort Wayne already developed)  
   - Player who reached Chicago auctions first Wabash share (minimum bid = current income / 1 = income)  
     - If no bids, share remains on charter  
   - Wabash shares now available for future auctions  

#### Dividend Phase  
Triggered when **two action indicators are in the red** at the start of a player’s turn.  
1. **Pay General Dividends**:  
   - For each company, dividend per share = income ÷ shares sold, **rounded up**  
   - Paid from **bank** to players  
2. **Reset all action indicators** to Start (green)  
3. **Advance Detroit** one space on Industrial City track (income of companies there increases by 1)  
4. **Check end game condition**: If Detroit reaches 8, game will end after next Dividend Phase  
5. Current player then takes their turn  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### End Game Trigger  
Game ends when **one or more** of the following occur:  
- 3 or more companies have **0 locomotives** left on their charter  
- 3 or more companies have **0 shares** left on their charter  
- 3 or fewer houses remain in the general supply  
- Detroit’s income reaches 8  

**The game ends immediately after the next General Dividend Phase** following the trigger.  

#### Final Scoring  
- Players count **only cash**  
- Shares have no value  
- **Player with the most money wins**  
- In case of a tie, tied players **share the victory**  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I choose an action but do nothing?**  
  Yes. You must move the dial, but may choose not to perform the action. This is a strategic way to limit future actions.  
- **What happens if two triggers occur at once?**  
  The game still ends after the next Dividend Phase. Only one Dividend Phase is needed regardless of how many triggers are active.  
- **Is player money public?**  
  Yes. All financial information is open.  
- **Can a company go bankrupt?**  
  No. A company simply cannot expand if it lacks funds. It can still pay dividends.  
- **Can I develop a hex with only an opponent’s train?**  
  Yes. As long as at least one locomotive is present (any company), you may develop it.  
- **Does developing Fort Wayne affect Wabash income when opened?**  
  Yes. If Fort Wayne is already developed when Wabash opens, Wabash starts with income 3 instead of 1.  
- **What if all shares of a company are sold?**  
  No more shares can be auctioned. The company can still expand and pay dividends.  
- **Can Wabash expand into New York?**  
  Yes. Only Wabash can expand into New York (cost: $6). It gains $8 income there.
