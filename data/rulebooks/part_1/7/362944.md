# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
War of the Ring: The Card Game is a 2–4 player competitive game based on The Lord of the Rings. Two teams — the Free Peoples and the Shadow — vie for victory through strategic card play, combat, and scenario-specific goals.

The Free Peoples strive to complete their quest (typically represented by progressing along Paths), while defending their lands. The Shadow seeks to disrupt the quest, corrupt the Ring-bearer, or overwhelm the Free Peoples through military force.

Victory is achieved either by:
- Leading the opposing team by 10 or more Victory Points (VP) at any Victory Check, or
- Having more VP after the final path combat is resolved. In case of a tie, the Shadow wins.

## 2. Components
- **120 Faction Cards**: 60 Free Peoples (Dunedain, Dwarf, Elf, Hobbit, Rohan, Wizard), 60 Shadow (Isengard, Monstrous, Mordor, Southron).
- **41 Location Cards**:
  - 7 Free Peoples Battlegrounds
  - 7 Shadow Battlegrounds
  - 27 Paths (numbered 1–9)
- **41 Tokens**:
  - 1 Starting Player token
  - 4 Ring tokens (2 per side)
  - 20 Combat tokens (5 per icon type)
  - 16 Corruption tokens
  - 1 Turn Order marker
  - 1 Turn Order tracker
  - 4 Player aids
- Each player requires:
  - A draw deck
  - A cycle pile
  - An eliminated pile
  - A reserve area
  - A scoring area (shared per team)

## 3. Setup
### General Setup
- **Select a Scenario** (e.g., Trilogy, Two-Player Duel, The Return of the King).
- **Prepare Decks**:
  - Each player uses a pre-defined faction composition.
  - Shuffle all cards of the appropriate factions into a 30-card deck.
- **Battleground and Path Decks**:
  - Separate Free Peoples and Shadow battlegrounds; shuffle each into a deck.
  - Assemble Path deck: stack paths 1–9 in order (3 copies per path).
- **Draw Cards**:
  - Players draw 7 cards, then cycle 2 (standard setup).
  - Adjustments apply per scenario.
- **Starting Player**:
  - Assigned per scenario (e.g., Frodo in Trilogy, Witch-King in Return of the King).
  - Place starting player token accordingly.

### Expert Drafting Rules (Optional)
- **Battleground Drafting**:
  - Free Peoples player draws 3 battlegrounds, chooses one; Shadow chooses one; third discarded.
  - Repeat for second pick.
  - Add undrawn 7th battleground to form a 5-card deck.
  - Shadow repeats the process for their battlegrounds (choosing first).
- **Deck Drafting**:
  - Each player drafts their 40-card deck by repeatedly drawing 3 cards, eliminating 1, cycling 2, until deck is complete.
  - Shuffle final deck.
- **Final Setup**:
  - Both players draw 7 cards, cycle 2.

### The Return of the King Scenario
- **Players**:
  - Witch-King (Shadow): Mordor, Monstrous, Southron factions.
  - Aragorn (Free Peoples): Dunedain, Elf, Hobbit, Rohan, Wizard factions.
- **Starting Player**: Witch-King.
- **Battlegrounds**:
  - Shadow: Umbar, Harad, Minas Morgul, Morannon.
  - Free Peoples: Minas Tirith, Pelargir, Dol Amroth.
- **Paths**: Use paths 7, 8, and 9 only.
- **Draw**: Each player draws 6 cards. No cycling.
- **Duration**: Exactly 3 rounds.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round follows this sequence:

### 1. Location Step
- Starting player activates:
  - One battleground (random from their team’s deck, unless scenario specifies).
  - One path (random next-numbered path, unless scenario specifies).
- Resolve activation text of both.
- Reactivating a battleground (from scoring area) triggers its text again; its defense icons are ignored if reactivated by opponent.

### 2. Action Step
- Players take turns in scenario-defined order (e.g., Frodo → Witch-King → Aragorn → Saruman).
- On your turn, take one action or pass.
- Play continues until all players pass consecutively.

**Available Actions**:
- Play 1 card from hand (must cycle another card).
- Move 1 character or army from reserve to active path/battleground.
- Cycle 1 card from hand.
- Winnow: eliminate 2 cards to draw 1.
- Use an action to resolve “use an action to…” text on a card in play.
- Use a Ring token (if available).

**Passing**:
- Allowed if:
  - Hand size ≤ carryover limit (starts at 2), or
  - Hand size < each opponent’s hand size.

### 3. Combat Step
- Starting player chooses order of combat resolution.
- **Battleground Combat**:
  - Defender: team matching battleground ownership (Free Peoples or Shadow).
  - Attacker: opposing team.
  - Steps:
    1. Count attacker’s × icons.
    2. Cancel × icons with battleground ● defense (including tokens).
    3. Defender cancels remaining × icons by eliminating cards.
    4. Leftover defender cards are cycled.
    5. All attacker cards are eliminated.
  - If all × icons canceled → defender wins.
  - Else → attacker wins.
  - Winner places battleground in scoring area.

- **Path Combat**:
  - Defender: Free Peoples.
  - Attacker: Shadow.
  - Steps:
    1. Count attacker’s ● icons.
    2. Cancel ● icons with path ● defense (including tokens).
    3. Free Peoples cancel remaining ● icons by eliminating cards.
    4. Leftover Free Peoples cards are cycled.
    5. All Shadow characters eliminated.
  - If all ● icons canceled → Free Peoples win path (place in scoring area for VP).
  - Else → Shadow gains corruption tokens = uncanceled ● icons (path placed face down).

### 4. Victory Check
- Calculate team VP:
  - Battlegrounds: printed VP.
  - Paths (Free Peoples): printed VP.
  - Corruption tokens (Shadow): 1 VP each.
  - Unused Ring tokens: 1 VP each (at game end).
- If one team leads by ≥10 VP → immediate win.
- After final path: higher score wins. Tie → Shadow wins.

### 5. Draw Step
- Players draw cards based on scenario:
  - Trilogy: Free Peoples draw 3, Shadow draw 4.
  - Two-Player Duel: Gandalf draws 4, Witch-King draws 6.
  - Return of the King: Witch-King draws 6, Aragorn draws 4.
- Pass starting player token to next player.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Carryover Limit**: Max hand size at end of Action Step (starts at 2).
- **Cycle**: Place card face down in cycle pile. When draw deck is empty, recycle cycle pile into new draw deck.
- **Eliminate**: Permanently remove card to eliminated pile.
- **Forsake**: Eliminate a card from hand, reserve, or top of draw deck (cannot peek at top card).
- **Remove**: Eliminate a card from anywhere (draw deck, cycle pile, hand, in play); reshuffle deck if removed from draw deck.
- **Winnow**: Eliminate 2 cards to draw 1.
- **Leadership Icons (⊗, ⊙)**: Count only if character is supported by same-faction army on same battleground.
- **Support**: One army supports one character; army and character can be lost separately.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### Scoring
- **Battlegrounds**: Winner gains printed VP.
- **Paths**:
  - Free Peoples: gain printed VP if they win.
  - Shadow: gain 1 VP per corruption token from path loss.
- **Corruption Tokens**: 1 VP each, gained when Free Peoples fail path combat.
- **Ring Tokens**: Unused tokens worth 1 VP each at game end.

### End Game Conditions
- Immediate win if one team leads by ≥10 VP after Victory Check.
- Game ends after combat on final path (e.g., path 9 in Trilogy, path 6 in Fellowship).
- If no immediate win, team with higher VP wins. Tie → Shadow wins.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you activate a path already used?**  
  No. Each path can be activated only once per game.

- **What happens if a battleground deck is empty?**  
  Draw from opponent’s deck. If both empty, skip battleground activation.

- **Can you pass with 3 cards if opponent has 4?**  
  Yes, if your hand size < each opponent’s.

- **What happens when you play the last card in hand?**  
  You must forsake a card (from hand, reserve, or top of deck) to satisfy the cycle cost.

- **Can items be transferred between characters?**  
  No. Items cannot be transferred.

- **Do defense tokens on a path cancel attack icons before character defense?**  
  Yes. Path defense (including tokens) cancels attack icons first.

- **Can you use a Ring token more than once?**  
  No. Usage depends on scenario:
  - Trilogy: once per game.
  - Two-Player Duel: once per round.
  - Return of the King: once per game, draw 2 cards.

- **What if you can’t eliminate a card when required?**  
  No penalty. But you cannot gain a benefit (e.g., winnow) if you cannot eliminate.

- **Can you play the same character twice in one round?**  
  No. Even if cycled and redrawn, you cannot play the exact same character or item card twice in one round.
