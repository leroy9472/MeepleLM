## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Argent: The Consortium is set in the World of Indines, where Chancellor Nostros Calahaan has retired, prompting a contest among candidates to be elected the new Chancellor. Players represent influential figures who must gather support from 12 hidden Consortium Voters by gaining resources, researching spells, recruiting supporters, and strategically placing mages across the University. The winner is the player who wins the most Voter cards. In case of a tie in Voter count, the player with the most Influence Points wins. If Influence is tied, the player whose marker reached that space first (bottom of the stack) wins.
