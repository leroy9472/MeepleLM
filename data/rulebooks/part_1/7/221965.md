## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Fox in the Forest is a trick-taking card game for 2 players. The objective is to score points by winning tricks, but players must be careful not to win too many, as exceeding a threshold results in zero points for that round. The first player to reach the target score (16, 21, or 35 depending on game length) wins.

2. Components  
- 33-card deck with 3 suits  
- Each suit contains ranks: Ace, 2–10, and Queen (ranks 1–11; Ace = 1, Queen = 11)  
- No additional components required

3. Setup  
- The dealer shuffles the 33-card deck.  
- Deal 13 cards to each player.  
- Place the remaining 7 cards face down as the Draw Deck.  
- Reveal the top card of the Draw Deck; this is the Decree Card and determines the Trump Suit for the round.  
- The non-dealer leads the first trick.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Players take turns playing one card each to form a trick.  
2. Non-dealer leads the first trick.  
3. The other player must follow suit if able. If unable, they may play any card.  
4. Card abilities trigger when the card is played, with timing as specified.  
5. After both cards are played, determine the winner of the trick:  
   - If any trump cards are played, the highest trump wins.  
   - Otherwise, the highest card of the lead suit wins.  
6. The winner of the trick takes both cards (face down) and leads the next trick.  
7. Repeat for 13 tricks (one full round).

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Following Suit**: The player who did not lead must follow suit if possible.  
- **Trump Suit**: Determined by the Decree Card. Trump cards beat all non-trump cards.  
- **Card Abilities** (activate when played):  
  - **Queen (11)**: When led, if the opponent has cards of that suit, they must play either the Ace (1) or their highest card in that suit.  
  - **9**: In a trick with only one 9 played, treat that 9 as if it belongs to the trump suit for determining the winner.  
  - **7**: Each 7 won in a trick is worth 1 point.  
  - **5**: After playing, draw one card from the Draw Deck, then return any one card from your hand to the bottom of the Draw Deck face down.  
  - **3**: After playing, you may exchange the Decree Card with a card from your hand.  
  - **Ace (1)**: If played and you lose the trick, you lead the next trick.  
- **Timing Clarifications**:  
  - The Fox (Queen) and Woodcutter (3) abilities take effect immediately.  
  - The Witch (9) ability does not affect the trick until after both cards are played.  
- **Card Visibility**: Players may not look at the faces of cards they have already won.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After 13 tricks, each player scores points based on the number of tricks won, using the following chart:  
  - Winning 0–5 tricks: score = number of tricks won  
  - Winning 6–7 tricks: score = 0  
  - Winning 8–13 tricks: score = number of tricks won  
  (Note: 6 and 7 tricks yield 0 points — avoid these!)  
- Additionally, each 7 won is worth 1 extra point.  
- The non-dealer becomes the dealer for the next round.  
- Game ends when a player reaches:  
  - 16 points (short game)  
  - 21 points (regular game)  
  - 35 points (long game)  
- If tied, the player who won more tricks in the final round wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I look at my won tricks?** No. Players may not examine the faces of cards they have taken.  
- **What if I have the Queen’s suit but not the Ace?** You must play your highest card in that suit.  
- **Can I play a 3 and not exchange the Decree Card?** Yes — “may” means it’s optional.  
- **Does playing a 9 make it trump?** Only for comparison in that trick — and only if only one 9 is played.  
- **When do I draw for playing a 5?** Immediately after playing the 5. Then return any card to the bottom of the deck face down.  
- **Can the Decree Card be changed?** Yes, by playing a 3 and choosing to exchange it.  
- **Does Ace ability trigger if I win the trick?** No — only if you play the Ace and lose the trick.
