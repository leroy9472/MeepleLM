## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Euphoria*, players are low-level managers in a dystopian society striving to gain control by increasing their authority. Workers are represented by dice, and their knowledge (die values) must be carefully managed—too much knowledge leads to instability. The goal is to place all 10 of your Authority stars (tokens) on the board through strategic worker placement, resource management, and faction allegiance.

**Objective**: Be the first player to place all 10 Authority stars on the board. If multiple players complete this on the same turn, tiebreakers are applied in order: highest Morale, lowest Knowledge, most Authority stars in markets, most in territories, then lowest total worker roll.

### 3. Setup
1. **Territories**: Place Unavailable Territory markers on each faction’s star so that open spaces = number of players.
2. **Markets**: Shuffle market tiles and place one face-down on each of the 6 construction sites. Icarus has 3 pre-built markets (Wind Saloon, Nimbus Loft, Breeze Bar, Sky Lounge).
3. **Tunnels**: Place a miner meeple at the start of each tunnel. Cover the end-space exclusive action with an Unavailable Action marker.
4. **Allegiance Tracks**: Place progress tokens at the start (left of Tier 1).
5. **Recruits**: Shuffle recruit deck. Deal 4 to each player. Each chooses:
   - 1 face-up (active)
   - 1 face-down (hidden)
   - Discard 2 face-down
6. **Ethical Dilemmas**: Shuffle and deal 1 face-down to each player.
7. **Player Pieces**:
   - 10 Authority tokens
   - 4 worker dice (2 in play, 2 in reserve pool)
   - Morale token on 1 of Morale track
   - Knowledge token on +3 of Knowledge track
8. **Resources & Commodities**: Place near corresponding areas:
   - Euphorian: Energy, Gold
   - Subterranean: Water, Stone
   - Wastelander: Food, Clay
   - Icarite: Bliss
9. **Starting Player**: Each player rolls 2 worker dice. Highest sum wins. Tiebreaker: oldest player. Keep dice as starting knowledge.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn, choose **exactly one** of the following actions. You may not pass.

#### 1. Place One Available Worker
- An available worker is one under your control not on the board.
- You may place **all workers showing the same number** at the start of your turn (e.g., two 4s = place both).
- When placing, pay cost (gray square), gain benefit (white circle).
- You may bump your own or others’ workers from **Temporary Use** spaces.

**Worker Placement Types**:
- **Temporary Use** (dotted square with arrow): May be occupied; placing here bumps existing worker.
- **Exclusive Action** (uncovered at tunnel end): Same as Temporary Use, but only usable by players with active recruit of that faction.
- **Multi-Use** (large rectangle): Unlimited workers; no bumping (e.g., commodity areas).
- **One-Time Use** (solid gray square): Pay cost to place; cannot be bumped (e.g., construction sites).

#### 2. Retrieve Any or All Workers
- Pay:
  - 1 Food **or** 1 Bliss → gain 2 Morale (cost is flat regardless of workers retrieved)
  - **OR** pay nothing → lose 1 Morale (allowed even at Morale 1; no loss if at 1)
- Retrieve any number of your workers.
- **Immediately roll all retrieved workers**.
- Check total knowledge: sum of all available workers’ values + current Knowledge track level.
  - If ≥16, **lose one worker** with highest knowledge (return to reserve pool).
  - Only one worker lost per turn, even if total is much higher.
  - Check only occurs when at least one worker is rolled.

#### 3. Resolve Ethical Dilemma (Once per game)
- Pay cost: either shown commodity **or** any 2 artifacts.
- Choose:
  - Place 1 Authority star on the Ethical Dilemma card, **or**
  - Draw 2 recruit cards, keep 1 (face-down or face-up if faction already activated), discard other.
    - If faction already activated, new recruit is immediately face-up.
    - If faction has reached Tier 4, immediately place star on recruit.

**Trading**: On your turn, you may freely trade resources, commodities, and artifact cards with other players.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Morale Track (♥)
- Determines maximum artifact hand size.
- If you exceed hand size, draw first, then discard down.
- If you lose Morale and exceed hand size, discard immediately.
- At 1 Morale: may retrieve workers for free (no loss), but cannot pay Morale for benefits.
- At 6 Morale: may still gain Morale (no effect).

#### Knowledge Track (♣)
- Adds to total when checking knowledge.
- At +6: may still gain Knowledge (no effect).
- When retrieving or gaining workers, roll and check total:
  - Sum = all available workers’ dice + Knowledge track value
  - If ≥16 → lose highest-knowledge worker
  - Only one worker lost per turn
  - Check only when rolling at least one die

#### Commodity Areas (Generator, Farm, Aquifer, Cloud Mine)
- Multi-Use spaces; any number of workers.
- Total Knowledge of all workers there determines benefit:
  - 1–4: Gain 1 Commodity, advance allegiance 1
  - 5–8: Gain 1 Commodity, lose 1 Knowledge
  - 9+: Gain 2 Commodities, gain 1 Knowledge
- Advance allegiance **immediately** and **non-optionally**.
- You may place even if at max/min Knowledge.

#### Tunnels
- Temporary Use space: pay cost (resource), advance miner 1 space, gain **one** benefit (resource **or** artifact).
- At space 6: all hidden recruits of that faction are **revealed (activated)**.
- At space 9: remove Unavailable Action marker → Exclusive Action space is now usable (only by players with active recruit of that faction).
- You may still use the tunnel action even after miner reaches end.

#### Construction Sites
- One-Time Use spaces: pay resource shown to place worker.
- Market is built when:
  - 2–3 players: any 2 spaces occupied
  - 4 players: any 3 spaces occupied
  - 5–6 players: all 4 spaces occupied
- Workers must be **simultaneously** present.
- If a worker is retrieved before completion, market is not built.
- When built:
  - Flip market tile, uncover Temporary Use action
  - Return workers to owners → roll and check knowledge
  - All contributors place **1 Authority star** on the market
  - All others suffer penalty (listed on tile)

#### Markets (Constructed and Icarite)
- To use a market: place worker on Temporary Use space, pay cost.
- Gain benefit, then:
  - Place 1 Authority star on **faction’s star territory**
  - Advance that faction’s allegiance 1 level
- **Icarite Markets (pre-built)**:
  - **Wind Saloon**: Discard 3 artifacts (or 2 matching) → advance allegiance, place star
  - **Nimbus Loft**: Pay 3 resources → advance allegiance, place star
  - **Breeze Bar**: Pay 1 Bliss + 1 other commodity → advance allegiance, draw 2 artifacts
  - **Sky Lounge**: Pay 1 Bliss + 1 other commodity → advance allegiance, gain 2 resources (any combo)

#### Artifact Markets
- Place worker on Temporary Use space.
- Pay: 3 different artifacts **or** 2 matching artifacts.
- Then:
  - Place 1 Authority star on:
    - Empty faction territory space, **or**
    - Constructed market of that faction (if no star there yet)
  - Advance allegiance 1 level
- **Cannot** place stars on Icarite pre-built markets via this method.

#### Recruit Abilities
- Only active (face-up) recruits’ abilities may be used.
- Hidden recruits activate when:
  - Their faction’s tunnel miner reaches space 6, **or**
  - Their allegiance track reaches Tier 3
- Some abilities trigger on placement, retrieval, bumping, etc.
- Example: *Amanda the Broker*: When your worker is bumped, pay 1 Bliss to **choose** its knowledge instead of rolling.

#### Authority Star Placement
You may place Authority stars on:
- Constructed markets (max 1 per player per market)
- Faction territories (no limit per player until space fills)
- Active recruit cards (once faction reaches Tier 4)
- Resolved Ethical Dilemma card (1 star)

  1. Highest Morale
  2. Lowest Knowledge
  3. Most Authority stars in markets
  4. Most Authority stars in territories
  5. Roll all active workers: lowest total wins

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I place more than one worker per turn?**  
  Only if you roll doubles at the start of your turn—you may place all matching dice, one at a time.

- **Can I bump my own worker?**  
  Yes, from Temporary Use spaces.

- **What happens when a worker is bumped?**  
  Owner retrieves it, rolls it, checks knowledge (sum with others + track). May lose worker if ≥16.

- **Can I use a recruit ability that requires losing Morale if at 1?**  
  Only if the ability does not require **paying** Morale. You may lose Morale when retrieving even at 1 (no effect).

- **Can I place a star on an Icarite market?**  
  Yes, by using Nimbus Loft, Breeze Bar, or Sky Lounge (placing star on Icarite territory), **but not** via artifact market.

- **Can I combine recruit abilities that affect card draw?**  
  No. Card draw abilities cannot be combined.

- **Can I use a worker just retrieved this turn?**  
  No. Retrieved workers must be rolled and checked before becoming available for placement (next turn).

- **Do I have to use allegiance bonuses?**  
  Tier 1–3 bonuses are automatic and mandatory when reached. Tier 4 requires placing stars on recruits.
