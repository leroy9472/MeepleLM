# 6 Nimmt: The Ascension Variant – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
The objective of 6 Nimmt: The Ascension Variant is to avoid accumulating penalty points, known as "Cattle Heads" (or "bullheads"). Each Cattle Head counts as 1 penalty point. The game ends when at least one player reaches 66 or more points. The winner is the player with the fewest points at that time. Alternatively, a player may win immediately by scoring 66 or more points in a single round ("Shoot the Moon" bonus rule).

### 2. Components
- 104 cards numbered 1 to 104
- Each card displays a number of Cattle Heads (penalty points) based on its value:
  - All cards: at least 1 Cattle Head
  - Cards ending in 5 (e.g., 5, 15, 25): 2 Cattle Heads
  - Multiples of 10 (e.g., 10, 20, 30): 3 Cattle Heads
  - Multiples of 11 (e.g., 11, 22, 33): 5 Cattle Heads
  - Card 55 (multiple of 11 and ends in 5): 7 Cattle Heads
- Players need paper and pencil for scorekeeping
- Each player has a personal "Horn Pile" (or "Bull Pile") to store taken cards

### 3. Setup
1. Shuffle the full deck of 104 cards.
2. Deal 10 cards face down to each player. Players keep their cards hidden and may arrange them in ascending order.
3. Place the top 4 cards from the remaining deck face up in the center of the table. These form the starting cards of the four rows.
4. Each row begins with one card and may contain up to 5 cards.
5. The rest of the deck is set aside and not used until the next round.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. Each round consists of 10 hands (turns), one for each card in players’ hands.
2. In each hand:
   a. All players simultaneously choose one card from their hand and place it face down.
   b. All cards are revealed simultaneously.
   c. Cards are resolved in ascending order of value: the player with the lowest card plays first, then the next lowest, and so on.
   d. Each player places their card into one of the four rows according to placement rules.
   e. If placing a card triggers a row take (by P1 or P3), the player takes the five cards in that row, and their card starts a new row.
   f. If a card cannot be placed due to being too low, the player chooses a row to take (P2).
   g. After all cards are placed, rows are reordered to maintain ascending order by first card value.
3. Repeat for 10 hands.
4. After the 10th hand, calculate scores.
5. If no player has 66 or more points, re-deal and begin a new round.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Row Management
- There are always exactly four rows.
- Rows are maintained in ascending order based on the value of the first card in the row.
- After any card placement that changes row composition, rows are reordered so that Row 1 has the lowest starting card, Row 2 the next lowest, etc.

#### Placement Rules (P1–P3)
**P1: Sixth Card Rule**  
If a player places the sixth card in a row (i.e., the row already has five cards), they must:
- Take the five existing cards into their Horn Pile.
- Their played card becomes the first (and only) card in a new row.
- The new row is inserted into the correct position so that all rows remain in ascending order by first card.

**P2: Lowest Card Rule**  
If a played card is lower than the first card of every existing row:
- The player must choose one row to take.
- They take all five cards in that row into their Horn Pile.
- Their played card becomes the first card of a new row.
- Rows are reordered so that all rows are in ascending order by first card.

**P3: Between Cards Rule**  
If a played card has a value that lies strictly between the first and last cards of any existing row (i.e., it could fit inside the sequence but not at the end), then:
- The player must take that entire row into their Horn Pile.
- Their played card starts a new row in the same position.
- Rows are reordered to maintain ascending order by first card.

> Note: This rule replaces the standard "least difference" rule for determining row placement. In this variant, placement is determined by value range inclusion, not proximity.

#### Row Reordering
After any row is taken and replaced:
- The new row (started with the played card) is placed in the correct numerical position.
- All rows are sorted so that Row 1 has the lowest first card, Row 2 the next lowest, etc.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- At the end of each round, each player counts the total Cattle Heads from all cards in their Horn Pile.
- This score is added to their cumulative total.
- The game ends immediately after any round in which one or more players have 66 or more points.
- The player with the lowest total score wins.

**Bonus Variant: Shoot the Moon**  
- If a player accumulates 66 or more Cattle Heads in a single round, they win the game immediately, regardless of their previous score.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
**Q: Can a card trigger both P2 and P3?**  
A: No. P2 applies only when the card is lower than all first cards. P3 applies when the card falls between the first and last card of any row. These are mutually exclusive.

**Q: What happens if multiple rows are affected in one round?**  
A: Cards are resolved in ascending order. Each card is placed and its effect (row take, new row, reordering) is fully resolved before the next card is processed.

**Q: How are ties in card value handled?**  
A: The source does not specify. In standard 6 Nimmt!, ties are resolved by player order or shared placement, but this variant does not clarify. Default assumption: cards are unique (1–104), so no ties occur.

**Q: Can a row have fewer than 5 cards?**  
A: Yes. Rows can have 1 to 5 cards. A new row starts with 1 card and grows until it is taken.

**Q: Is the "least difference" rule used?**  
A: No. This variant replaces the standard "least difference" rule with P3 (Between Cards Rule). Placement is determined by whether the card fits within the range of an existing row, not by proximity to the last card.
