### 1. Lore & Objective
Madeira is set in the 15th century, where players represent settlers developing the Portuguese island of Madeira. The economy evolves from wheat to sugar to wine production. Players aim to gain the most Prestige Points (PP) by fulfilling the Crown's Requests, managing resources, and strategically using buildings, characters, and guilds. The game ends after 5 rounds, and the player with the most PP wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of 5 rounds has 5 phases:

**Phase A: Round Setup**
1. Place Characters: Shuffle 4 Character tiles and place on Buildings, skipping the one matching the current round (I–V).
2. Roll Pirate Dice: Roll 3 black dice, place in City Watch.
3. Roll Guild Dice: Roll 3 turquoise dice per row on Guild Board.
4. Choose Guild: In turn order:
   - Select a row.
   - Take the 3 Guild Dice.
   - Place Turn Order disc on that row (sets Phase B order).
   - Take 1 Crown’s Request from that row.
   - Flip back any Guild Favors of that guild to active.

**Phase B: Character Actions**
- In turn order, players either:
  - **Place a Guild Die**: On a Character. Pay Bread if die < Region number. Place Action Marker on Building. Take Character Action immediately.
  - **Place a Pirate Die**: Use one from City Watch. Return 1 Worker from City Watch to supply. Take Character Action. No Action Marker placed.
  - **Pass**: Move Turn Order disc to an empty Passing space. Gain Reals or perform Passing Action.

**Dice Limits**:
- Max dice per Character = number of players.
- Max 1 Pirate die per Character.

**Character Actions**:
- **Steward**: Move up to 2 of your Workers to any Fields where you have none.
- **Guild Master**: Pay 2–5 Wood (as per column) to take a Guild Favor. Can buy Wood if needed and have access.
- **Commander**: Move up to 2 Ships to empty Market or Colony slots. Pay 1 Wood per Ship from supply. Discard goods to gain Reals (Market) or activate King’s Reward (Colony).
- **Mayor**: Move up to 2 Workers (your own or Neutral) between City spaces. Then gain resources based on cities where you have Workers:
  - Porto Santo: 2 Bread per own Worker, 1 per Neutral.
  - Funchal: 2 Reals per own Worker, 1 per Neutral.
  - Machico: 2 Wood per own Worker, 1 per Neutral (only if you have wood access).
- **Harvest**: Instead of Character Action, harvest all your Fields in the Character’s Region. If using the empty building, harvest one Field twice.

**Phase C: Building Actions**
- Resolve Buildings 1 to 5 in order.
- For each Building with Action Markers:
  - Roll all dice on its Character.
  - In turn order (Passing Column), each player with an Action Marker chooses:
    - **Pay Cost**: Cost = Base (10/9/8 for 4/3/2 players) – sum of Guild dice (min 0). Then perform Building Action once.
    - **Take Pirates**: Gain 1 + value of Pirate die (if any).
- Building Actions depend on Workers in Region:
  - **Moinho (Region 2)**: 1–2 Workers → 2 Bread; 3+ → 5 Bread.
  - **Capitania (Region 2)**: 1–2 Workers → 1 PP + move 1 Worker; 3+ → 3 PP + move 2 Workers.
  - **Alfândega (Region 1)**: 1–2 Workers → move 1 Worker to Colony; 3+ → move 2 Workers to Colonies. Gain 1 PP per Ship in Colony moved to.
  - **Casa da Coroa (Region 3)**: 1–2 Workers → flip 1 Guild Favor face-up; 3+ → flip up to 2.
  - **Fortaleza (Region 3)**: 1–2 Workers → move 1 Worker to City Watch (discard up to 3 Pirates); 3+ → move up to 2 Workers (discard up to 3 Pirates each).

**Phase D: Maintenance**
1. **Honor**: Player with most Workers in City Watch (no tie) may return one to supply for 4 PP.
2. **Income**: For each Worker in a Colony, gain the good depicted.
3. **Upkeep**: Pay 1 Wood per Ship. Can buy Wood if needed and have access. For each unpaid Wood, take 1 Pirate.
4. **Feeding**: Pay 1 Bread per Worker on board. Windmill level feeds that many automatically. For each unpaid Bread, take 1 Pirate.

**Phase E: Crown’s Requests**
- **Rounds 1, 3, 5**: Each player scores 1, 2, or 3 Crown’s Requests (discard after scoring). Must assign different targets if scoring multiple of same type.
- **Rounds 2, 4**: Convert Fields:
  - Round 2: Convert Wheat → Sugar (if no Wood).
  - Round 4: Convert Sugar → Wine (if no Wood).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Guild Favors**: Can be used once per action (before taking it) to gain benefits (e.g., extra wood, Reals, move ships). Flipped to inactive after use. Reset when choosing same guild.
- **Windmill**: Free actions during Phases B, C, D:
  - Discard 2 goods → take 1 good.
  - Discard 2 Wheat → move up 1 space.
  - At top: Discard 2 Wheat → 1 PP.
  - Move down 1 space → 1 Bread or 3 Reals.
  - At bottom: Lose 1 PP → 1 Bread or 1 Real.
- **Wood Access**: Required to buy or take Wood. Access via:
  - Worker on Field with Wood → buy from that Field.
  - Worker on Forest Field → buy from general supply.
- **Pirate Dice**: Allow extra actions but risk gaining Pirates if not paying Building costs.
- **Passing**: Determines next round’s turn order and grants immediate benefits.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Resources**: Convert all Goods, Wood, Bread to Reals (1:1). Score 1 PP per 5 Reals.
- **Pirates**:
  - Most: -16 PP
  - Second: -8 PP
  - Third: -4 PP
  - Fourth: -2 PP
  - Tiebreaker: turn order (earlier loses fewer).

- **Winner**: Highest total PP. Tiebreaker: turn order.
