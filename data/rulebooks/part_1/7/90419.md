## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Airlines Europe*, players are investors in the early days of European passenger aviation, competing to earn the most victory points (VP) by strategically investing in and expanding airline networks. The goal is to own the most valuable shares in airlines at the time of scoring, leveraging route expansion, share control, and strategic timing. The game ends after three scoring phases, and the player with the most VP wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On each turn, choose **one** of four actions:

#### A) Buy 1–2 Route Licenses and Take 1 Share  
- Pay cost shown in cheapest available circle on a route.  
- Place one airplane of the chosen airline on that circle.  
- Move airline’s marker forward on scoring track by route cost.  
- Route must connect to airline’s home airport via existing routes.  
- Only one airplane per airline per route.  
- May buy a second license (same or different airline) following same rules.  
- After 1 or 2 purchases, draw **1** share (from stock market or top of deck).  
  - If taken from market, refill market from deck.  
  - If a scoring card is drawn, trigger scoring (see below).  

**Bonus Connections**: If a route completes a connection for one of the four smallest airlines (green, orange, gray, white) to its target city, advance its marker by the bonus value (7 or 8) and return marker to box.  

#### B) Play Share Cards and Receive Dividends  
- Play from hand:  
  - Any number of shares from **one** airline, **or**  
  - One share each from **two** different airlines.  
- Add played shares to portfolio (public).  
- Receive 2 million Euros per share played.  

#### C) Acquire Air ABACUS Shares  
- Discard from hand and/or portfolio:

  - 3 shares → 2 Air ABACUS shares  
- Add Air ABACUS shares to hand. Discarded shares are out of game (except in 2-player).  
- Max 2 Air ABACUS shares per turn.  

#### D) Take Cash  
- Take 8 million Euros from the bank.  

**Bank Bankruptcy**:  
- If bank lacks funds, all players with >8 million return excess to bank.  
- Remove all face-up stock market cards from game.  
- Draw 5 new cards to refill market.  
- Then complete the action.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Route Expansion**: Increases airline value on scoring track.  
- **Share Portfolio**: Only shares in portfolio (not hand) score.  
- **Stock Market**: 5 face-up shares; replenished when taken.  
- **Scoring Triggers**: Drawing a scoring card (from deck or market refill) interrupts play.  
- **Air ABACUS**: No routes; only acquired via Action C; scores fixed points per round.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Triggering Scoring**:  
- When a scoring card is drawn (during action A or market refill), scoring begins.  
- Scoring card is given to next player (clockwise).  

**Scoring Procedure**:  
1. **Empty Stock Market**:  
   - Starting with player holding scoring card, each player takes one face-up share from market (no refill during this).  
   - Remaining market cards and scoring card are removed from game.  
   - Refill market with 5 cards from deck.  
2. **Score Airlines**:  
   - Score each airline in order from highest to lowest on scoring track.  
   - For each airline:  
     - Players announce number of shares in portfolio.  
     - VP awarded based on position (1st, 2nd, etc.) using values under airline’s marker.  
     - **Ties**: Add VP values for tied positions; divide equally, round up.  
     - Players must have at least one share to score.  
   - **Air ABACUS** scores last with fixed values:  
     - 1st scoring: 4/2/1/0  
     - 2nd scoring: 8/4/2/1/0  
     - 3rd scoring: 16/8/4/2/1  
3. **Resume Play**: Next turn starts with player who held scoring card.  

**Game End**:  
- Game ends immediately after **third scoring**.  
- Player with most VP wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Most Air ABACUS shares.  
- **Still tied**: Shared victory.  

**Premature End**: If all airlines are blocked (no valid routes), conduct final scoring immediately.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Hand Size**: Always public; number of cards visible.  
- **Portfolio Display**: Must be face-up, grouped by airline.  
- **Scoring Card Drawn During Market Refill**: Given to next player; they trigger scoring.  
- **2-Player Variant**:  
  - Discarded shares form face-down pile (not removed).  
  - At 3rd scoring, create fictitious 3rd player with:  
    - Remaining Air ABACUS shares  
    - Stock market shares  
    - Remaining deck  
    - Discard pile  
- **Power Grid Route Restriction (Variant)**:  
  - Phase 1 (before 1st scoring): 1 plane per route  
  - Phase 2 (before 2nd scoring): 2 planes per route  
  - Phase 3 (before 3rd scoring): 3 planes per route (if available)  
  - Prevents early dominance by small airlines.  
- **Multiple Shareholder Scoring (Variant)**:  
  - If one player leads by >1 share, they may split holdings.  
  - Example: 7 vs 2 → split 3 and 4 → score 1st and 2nd.  
  - Split is notional and temporary.
