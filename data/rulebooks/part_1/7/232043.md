## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
You are a royal vying to expand your kingdom by claiming and developing diverse terrains. The goal is to build the most prosperous 5×5 (3–4 players) or 7×7 (2 players) kingdom by strategically placing dominoes, collecting taxes, constructing buildings, and earning the Queen’s favor. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

2. Components  
- 48 domino tiles (each with two terrain squares)  
- 4 starting tiles (single-square castles)  
- 4 3D castle standees (one per player)  
- 8 King meeple pawns (2 per player in 2-player games, 1 otherwise)  
- 22 black Knight meeple figures  
- 32 Building Tiles (grey side up initially)  
- 1 Builders' Board  
- 15 grey Towers  
- 1 Queen meeple  
- 1 Dragon meeple  
- 42 Coins (values: 1, 3, and 9)  
- 1 Scoring Pad  

3. Setup  
- Shuffle all 48 dominoes and place them in the box as a draw pile, number-side down.  
- Place the Builders' Board in the center. Shuffle the 32 Building Tiles and place them grey-side-up on the red square of the board (this is the draw pile).  
- Take the top 6 Building Tiles and place them face-up on the 6 spaces of the Builders' Board track.  
- Place the Dragon on the "Cave" space and the Queen nearby.  
- Each player takes:  
  - 1 starting tile and places their castle on it  
  - 1 Knight  
  - Coins totaling 7 in value (e.g., seven 1s or mix of 1s and 3s)  
  - 1 King meeple (2 in 2-player games)  
- Draw the first 4 dominoes from the pile, arrange them number-side down in ascending order (lowest at top), then flip them face-up.  
- Randomly draw player pawns one at a time; players place their pawn on a domino to claim it.  
  - In 2-player games: First player places 1 pawn, second player places 2 pawns, first player places final pawn.  
  - In 3-player games: One domino is left unclaimed and discarded each round.  
- After all pawns are placed, draw 4 new dominoes, arrange numerically, and flip face-up.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 12 rounds. Each round proceeds in this order:  
1. Players take turns in order of their pawn position on the domino column (lowest number goes first).  
2. On a turn, perform these actions in sequence:  
   A. **Placement (Mandatory)**: Add your claimed domino to your kingdom.  
   B. **Collect Tax (Optional)**: Use 1 or 2 Knights to collect coins.  
   C. **Construct Building (Optional)**: Buy and place a building.  
   D. **Bribe Dragon (Optional)**: Pay 1 coin to remove a building from the board.  
   E. **Select New Domino (Mandatory)**: Place your pawn on a domino in the next line.  
3. After all players complete their turns:  
   - Return Dragon to the cave.  
   - Slide remaining building tiles left to fill gaps.  
   - Refill the Builders' Board to 6 tiles from the draw pile.  
   - Draw 4 new dominoes, arrange numerically number-side down, then flip face-up.  
   - In 3-player games, discard the unclaimed domino.  
4. Repeat for 12 rounds.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Placement Rules**:  
  - Kingdoms must fit within a 5×5 grid (3–4 players) or 7×7 grid (2 players).  
  - At least one terrain on the placed domino must match an adjacent terrain in your kingdom.  
  - The starting tile is "wild" — any terrain can connect to it.  
  - Once placed, dominoes cannot be moved.  
  - If a domino cannot be legally placed, it must be discarded (only if no legal placement exists).  

- **Collect Tax (Knights)**:  
  - After placing a domino, you may place 1 or 2 Knights on the two halves.  
  - For each Knight, collect coins equal to the size of the connected territory it enters.  
  - Knights remain on the board for the rest of the game.  
  - You may place Knights even in territories already containing Knights.  

- **Construct Building**:  
  - Requires at least one open red construction square in your kingdom (not necessarily on the newly placed domino).  
  - Choose any available building from the Builders' Board.  
  - Pay the listed cost (reduced by 1 if you host the Queen).  
  - Place the building red-side-up on any open red square.  
  - Collect immediate bonuses (e.g., extra Knights or Towers).  
  - Ongoing bonuses:  
    - "+coin/Knight": Gain extra coins equal to total Knights when collecting tax.  
    - "+coin/Tower": Gain extra coins equal to total Towers when collecting tax.  
  - Only one building per red square.  

- **Bribe the Dragon**:  
  - Only allowed if:  
    - Dragon is in the cave  
    - You do not host the Queen  
  - Pay 1 coin to the bank.  
  - Choose any building tile on the Builders' Board, remove it (discard to box), and place the Dragon on that space.  
  - Only one player per round may bribe the Dragon.  

- **Select New Domino**:  
  - After completing previous actions, place your King meeple on any domino in the next line.  
  - This determines both your domino for next turn and your play order (lower numbers go first).  
  - In 2-player games, each player performs all actions twice per round (once per King).

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After the 12th round, players take a final turn (actions A–D only — no new domino selection).  
- Final scoring:  
  - **Coins**: 1 point per 3 unused coins (round down).  
  - **Territories**: For each connected terrain group:  
    - Multiply number of squares by number of crowns in the group.  
    - Groups without crowns score 0.  
    - The Queen, if hosted, is placed on the largest territory and counts as 1 extra crown.  
  - **Buildings**: Score points based on lower-right symbols:  
    - Number: Fixed points  
    - "2 with X": 2 points per territory of that terrain type  
    - "1/Tower": 1 point per Tower in kingdom  
    - "1/Knight": 1 point per Knight (used or unused)  
  - **Tiebreaker**: Player with the largest single territory wins. If still tied, all tied players win.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I discard a domino I can legally place?**  
  No. If a legal placement exists (within grid and matching terrain), you must place it.  
- **Can the Queen be moved during the game?**  
  Yes. She moves to the player with the most (or tied for most) Towers immediately when that condition is met.  
- **Can I use the Dragon if I have the Queen?**  
  No. Only players not hosting the Queen may bribe the Dragon.  
- **What happens to the Dragon if no one uses it?**  
  It remains in the cave and is reset there during round cleanup.  
- **Can I build on a red square not on the domino I just placed?**  
  Yes. Any open red square in your kingdom is eligible.  
- **Do I get ongoing bonuses immediately?**  
  Yes, but only when you collect tax. For example, if you build a "+coin/Knight" building, you gain extra coins the next time (and every time) you collect tax.  
- **Can I place a Knight on a territory with a building?**  
  Yes. Buildings and Knights coexist; the Knight still taxes the territory size.
