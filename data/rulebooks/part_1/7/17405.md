# 1846 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *1846: The Race for the Midwest*, 3–5 players take on the roles of tycoons investing in and operating railroads across the midwestern United States from 1846 to 1935. Inspired by real historical railroads, players aim to build profitable networks, manage stock portfolios, and leverage private companies to maximize personal wealth. Victory is determined solely by a player’s final cash and stock value.

**Objective:** At game end, the player with the highest total of cash on hand and stock portfolio value (based on final stock prices) wins.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Stock Round
- **Order:** Clockwise, starting with Priority Deal holder.
- **Actions per player turn (in order):**
  1. **Sell any number of shares** (optional).
     - President selling causes stock price to drop one column left.
     - Max 50% of shares in Stock Market.
     - President certificate cannot be sold to Stock Market.
     - Only President may sell shares before a corporation operates.
  2. **Buy one certificate** (optional).
     - From Stock Market (pay bank) or corporate treasury (pay treasury).
     - Cannot buy shares in a corp you just sold from.
     - Max 60% ownership per player per corporation.
     - Certificate Limit applies (see below).
- **End of Round:**
  - All players pass consecutively → round ends.
  - Priority Deal passes to left of last buyer/seller.
  - **Stock Price Adjustment (in price order):**
    - Right one column if 100% held by players.
    - Left one column if any shares in Stock Market.

#### Operating Round
**Order of Operations:**
1. **Private Companies:** Owners receive income from bank.
2. **Independent Railroads:** Michigan Southern, then Big 4 operate.
3. **Corporations:** In descending stock price order (top to bottom for ties), **except** first Operating Round: use **reverse** order.

**Corporation Operations (in order):**
A. **Issue or Redeem Shares**
   - **Issue:** Move shares from treasury to Stock Market. Receive one step *less* than current price per share.
   - **Redeem:** Buy shares from Stock Market. Pay one step *more* than current price per share.
   - Max issue: (shares held by players) – (shares in Stock Market).
   - No stock price change from issuing/redeeming.

B. **Build Network (in any order)**
   - **Lay up to 2 tiles:**
     - Only 1 may be an upgrade.
     - First must be yellow in empty hex.
     - Second: yellow tile or upgrade.
     - Cost: $20 or terrain cost (whichever higher), plus hexside costs (bridge/tunnel) if connecting.
     - Must connect new track to existing token (exceptions: MC, O&I, LSL).
   - **Place up to 1 token:**
     - Cost: $80 (or $40 for reserved city if connected).
     - Must connect to city (exceptions: B&O in Cincinnati, PA in Fort Wayne).
     - Cannot place in reserved city if another corp owns it (pre-Phase IV).

C. **Run Routes**
   - One route per train.
   - Route must:
     - Include at least one city with operating corp’s token.
     - Visit each location only once.
     - Not pass through blocked cities (all spots occupied).
     - Not visit multiple Chicago city spots.
     - Not run E to E.
   - **N/M Trains:** Visit up to M locations, count up to N for revenue.
   - **East-West Bonus:** Route from E to W off-board earns bonus equal to sum of listed E and W values.
   - Track must be distinct per route.

D. **Dividend Declaration & Stock Adjustment**
   - Choose:
     - **Full:** Pay revenue ÷ 10 per share to shareholders.
     - **Half:** Retain ⌊revenue/2⌋ in treasury; pay remainder ÷ 10 per share.
     - **Retain:** Keep all in treasury.
   - **Stock Price Adjustment (based on payout vs. current price):**
     - < 0.5 × price → left 1
     - ≥ 0.5 × price, < 1 × price → no move
     - ≥ 1 × price, < 2 × price → right 1
     - ≥ 2 × price, < 3 × price → right 2 (if price ≥ $165 → right 3)
     - ≥ 3 × price and price ≥ $165 → right 3

E. **Buy Trains**
   - From bank (list price) or consenting corp (≥ $1).
   - Must own at least one non-phased-out train at end of turn.
   - **Forced Purchase:** If no train after running, must buy:
     - Use treasury → issue shares (stock drops per share issued) → President cash.
     - If President cannot raise cash → bankrupt.

#### Private Company Purchases
- During operations, corp may buy Private Company from player for $1–face value.
- **Abilities (usable after purchase, before removal):**
  - **Michigan Central / Ohio & Indiana:** Lay 2 free yellow tiles in reserved hexes. Must connect if both laid.
  - **Lake Shore Line:** Free upgrade in Cleveland or Toledo (green tiles available).
  - **Chicago & Western Indiana:** Free token in Chicago (if none already there).
  - **Meat Packing Co.:** Place $30 marker in St. Louis or Chicago (adds to route revenue).
  - **Steamboat Co.:** Place/move $20 Port marker (adds per port symbol on route).
    - Owner may assign marker to corp/IR before purchase.
- **Removal:**
  - All Private Companies removed at start of **Phase III**, except Mail Contract (remains).
  - **Markers** (Meat Packing, Steamboat) remain until **Phase IV**.

#### Independent Railroads
- Operate before corps: Michigan Southern, then Big 4.
- Lay track, run 2-train, split revenue 50/50 with owner.
- **When purchased:**
  - Pay ≤ face value (exclude debt).
  - Corp must have train space.
  - Cannot run 2-train in purchase round.
  - Add train and treasury to corp; replace token.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End:** After the Stock Round + 2 Operating Rounds in which the bank runs out of money.
  - Add removed $500s to bank to complete payments.
  - **Alternative end:** All but one player bankrupt.
- **Scoring:**
  - Each player totals:
    - Cash on hand.
    - Stock portfolio value (shares × final stock price).
    - **If game ends before Phase III:** Add list price of held Private Companies.
  - Ignore corporate treasuries.
- **Winner:** Highest total.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **President Certificate in Stock Market:**
  - No one may sell shares.
  - Buying 20% → becomes President (swap shares).
  - Corp operates passively: runs routes (max revenue), retains, shifts price left 1 (or 2 if no train).
- **Bankruptcy:**
  - President fails forced train purchase → bankrupt.
  - All shares sold to Stock Market (even >50% or Pres cert).
  - Cash raised added to corp treasury.
  - May cause Presidency change; new Pres must buy train.
  - Certificate Limit unchanged.
- **Ties in Stock Price Order:** Resolve top to bottom in column.
- **Certificate Limit:** Depends on corps in play and players:
  - 3 players: 8
  - 4 players: 9
  - 5 players: 10
  - Each 20% cert or Private Co. counts as one.
- **Phasing:**
  - Phase I: Yellow tiles only, Train Limit 4.
  - Phase II: Green tiles available.
  - Phase III: Brown tiles, remove Private Cos (except Mail Contract), phase out I-trains, Train Limit 3.
  - Phase IV: Gray tiles, remove markers, phase out II-trains, Train Limit 2.
  - Advance phase when first train of next phase bought.
