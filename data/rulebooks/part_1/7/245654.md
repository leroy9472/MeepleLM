## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Railroad Ink™ is a route-building puzzle game where players compete to create the most efficient and interconnected transportation networks. Over a fixed number of rounds, players simultaneously draw routes based on shared dice rolls, aiming to connect Exits through Highways and Railways. The goal is to maximize points by connecting Exits into large Networks, building long continuous Highways and Railways, and utilizing special features like Central Spaces and optional expansions.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Player Board per player  
- 6 Special Routes (marked on each board)  
- 4 Route Dice  
- 2 River Dice (Expansion)  
- 2 Lake Dice (Expansion)  
- 1 Marker per player (for tracking)  

Note: Additional dice and mechanics are introduced in various expansions.

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player takes one board and a marker.  
2. Place the 4 Route dice in the center of the table.  
3. Optional expansions (e.g., River, Lake) require their respective dice to be rolled alongside the Route dice.  
4. No initial drawing; play begins with the first dice roll.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **7 rounds** (6 if using River or Lake expansion).  
Each round proceeds as follows:  
1. **Roll Dice**: Roll the 4 Route dice (and any expansion dice).  
2. **Simultaneous Drawing**: All players draw the rolled Route patterns on their boards.  
3. **Optional Special Route**: Use one of the 6 unique Special Routes (only once per game, max 3 per game, 1 per round).  
4. **Mark Round**: Write the round number in all newly drawn spaces.  
5. Proceed to next round.  

Game ends after the final round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Route Dice  
- **3 standard dice**: Show one of:  
  - Straight Highway  
  - Straight Railway  
  - Curved Highway  
  - Curved Railway  
  - T-junction Highway  
  - T-junction Railway  
- **1 special die**: Shows one of:  
  - Overpass (allows Highway and Railway to cross without connecting)  
  - Straight Station (connects Highway and Railway)  
  - Curved Station (connects Highway and Railway)  

#### Drawing Rules  
- Must draw **all 4** rolled routes if possible.  
- Each route must connect to an Exit or existing route by at least one side.  
- Routes may be **rotated or reversed** freely.  
- **Highways and Railways cannot connect directly**—must use a Station.  

#### Special Routes  
- Located on top of board; 6 available, each usable **once per game**.  
- Can use **up to 3 Special Routes total**, and **only 1 per round**.  
- Mark used Special Routes to track availability.  

#### Overpasses and Stations  
- **Overpass**: Allows Highway and Railway to cross; does **not** connect them.  
- **Station**: Allows Highway and Railway to connect; must be placed where both route types meet.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Scoring Categories  
- **Connected Exits**:  
  - Count each group of connected Exits (Network).  
  - Score based on Network size using the **Network Values table**:  
    - 2 Exits: 1 point  
    - 3: 3  
    - 4: 6  
    - 5: 10  
    - 6: 15  
    - 7+: 20  

- **Longest Highway**:  
  - Longest unbroken chain of connected Highway segments.  
  - Score **1 point per space**.  
  - Stations do not break continuity.  
  - If tied, only one counts.  

- **Longest Railway**:  
  - Same as Highway, but for Railways.  

- **Central Spaces**:  
  - 9 central spaces of the board.  
  - Score **1 point per occupied** central space.  

#### Penalty: Errors  
- At game end, check all **unconnected route ends**.  
- Each open end (not connected to another route or board edge) is an **Error**.  
- Mark with ⊗.  
- **Lose 1 point per Error**.  

#### Final Score  
- Sum all points from Networks, Longest Routes, and Central Spaces.  
- Subtract Error penalties.  
- Highest score wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Fewest Errors.  
- If still tied, share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip a route if I can’t place it?**  
  Yes, if it cannot be legally placed (no valid connection).  
- **Can I use more than 3 Special Routes?**  
  No. Max 3 per game, 1 per round.  
- **Do Overpasses count as connections?**  
  No. They allow crossing but do not connect Highway and Railway.  
- **Can a route loop back on itself?**  
  Yes, but only the longest **unbranched** path counts for Longest Highway/Railway.  
- **Can I use a Special Route to connect Highway and Railway?**  
  Only if the Special Route includes a Station.
