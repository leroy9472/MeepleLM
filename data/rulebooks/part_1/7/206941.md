# First Class — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In "First Class," players are railroad tycoons competing to attract prestigious passengers and build luxurious trains. Inspired by the Orient Express, players earn Victory Points (VP) through train construction, route expansion, fulfilling contracts, and end-game scoring. The game ends after 6 rounds. After final scoring, the player with the most VP wins. In case of a tie, all tied players share the victory.

3. Setup  
- Choose 2 Modules (A–E) to play with; combine their cards with the 72 Base Game ("X") cards.  
- Shuffle each color stack (Green/1, Blue/2, Red/3) separately to form 3 Action card decks of 40 cards each.  
- Sort Train Car cards into 6 stacks by value: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 12.  
- Stack Locomotive tiles in descending order: 15, 14, 13, 12, 8, 7, 6, 5 (top to bottom). Place Constantinople tile beside the stack.  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 1 Player board  
  - 1 Coin  
  - 3 Conductors (1 placed on Scoring track at 0/50, 2 on board)  
  - 1 Locomotive (placed on starting space of board)  
  - 6 Wooden cubes  
  - 4 Mail Car cards  
  - 2 Train Car cards (0-point, placed as first cars in upper and lower trains)  
- Shuffle End of Game cards. The player to the right of Start Player draws (N+1) cards, chooses one, and passes the rest counterclockwise. Each player keeps one. Return leftover card to deck.  
- Reveal 4 End of Game cards face up near the play area.  
- Lay out 18 Green Action cards (Round 1–2) in 3 rows of 6. Place Start Player tile to the left of the top-left card.  
- Assign Start Player (figure).

4. Gameplay Flow  
- The game lasts 6 rounds, divided into 3 eras:  
  - Rounds 1–2: Green Action cards  
  - Rounds 3–4: Blue Action cards  
  - Rounds 5–6: Red Action cards  
- Each round:  
  1. Reveal 18 Action cards in 3×6 grid (if starting a new stack).  
  2. Players take 3 turns each, starting with Start Player, proceeding clockwise.  
  3. On a turn, a player either:  
     - Takes 1 Action card and performs its action(s), or  
     - Takes 1 Action card and upgrades 1 Train Car instead, or  
     - Takes the Start Player tile (if available).  
  4. After all players take 3 turns (or display empties), round ends.  
  5. Perform intermediate scoring after Rounds 2, 4, and 6.  
- After Round 6, perform final scoring.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Action Card Use**:  
  - Perform all possible actions on a card. Place card face-down next to player board.  
  - Or, ignore action and upgrade 1 Train Car by 1 value level (e.g., 0→1, 1→2).  
- **Start Player Tile**:  
  - Taking it grants immediate bonuses to all players (as shown on tile).  
  - The taker becomes Start Player for next round and scoring phase.  
  - After taking, remove the leftmost card from the top row.  
- **Train Construction**:  
  - Trains start with a 0-point car. Add cars to the right.  
  - Upgrade rules:  
    - Can only upgrade eligible cars (e.g., 0→1, 1→2, etc.).  
    - Cannot skip levels.  
    - Cannot upgrade a car beyond the one to its left.  
    - If multiple cars of same value, upgrade leftmost first.  
  - **Mail Car**: When adding a 5th car to a train, immediately add a Mail Car as the 6th. Mail Car grants a one-time bonus (e.g., move Locomotive, upgrade). Cannot be upgraded. Worth 0 points.  
  - **Locomotive Tile**: When adding a 9th car, immediately add the top Locomotive tile as the 10th (Engine). Grants 1–2 immediate upgrades. Train is now complete (no more cars). Locomotive tile earns its VP in each scoring if Conductor has reached it.  
- **Route & Movement**:  
  - **Locomotive**: Moves along route (Paris to Orient). Earns VP when passing "Victory Point" cities. Earns bonuses when passing "Bonus" cities (collected in scoring phases).  
  - **Route Cards**: Extend route to the left. Contain cities with bonuses or VP.  
  - **Conductor**: Moves along train cars. Only cars to the left of or under Conductor score VP.  
- **Coins**:  
  - Stored on player board (12 spaces), filled left to right, bottom to top.  
  - Spend during turn or scoring phase for:  
    - Column 1: Take a 0-point Train Car.  
    - Column 2: Move Locomotive 1 city OR move 1 Conductor 1 car.  
    - Column 3: Upgrade 1 Train Car by 1 level.  
    - 4 Coins (any columns): Take 1 End of Game card.  
    - 1 Coin (any): Gain 1 VP.  
- **End of Game Cards**:  
  - Each player starts with 1. Can buy more for 4 Coins or gain via Action cards.  
  - When taken, perform its action immediately, then keep face-down.  
  - Refill display to 4 cards at end of turn.  
- **Clearing Action Rows**:  
  - When # of taken cards in a row = # of players, discard remaining cards in that row.  
  - Start Player tile is not removed unless taken.  
- **Contracts (Modules A, B, C, D)**:  
  - Placed face up when taken.  
  - Fulfill when requirements met (e.g., train composition, Mail Cars placed, etc.).  
  - Receive bonus once upon fulfillment (can be during turn or scoring).  
  - Completed contracts go face-down with action cards.  
- **Module-Specific Mechanics**:  
  - **Module B (Celebrities & Postcards)**:  
    - Celebrity: Place in first free train car. Doubles that car’s VP in scoring (if Conductor passed).  
    - Postcard: Assign to a Route card. Doubles its bonus in scoring.  
  - **Module C (Who is the Murderer?)**:  
    - Each player draws 1 "Murderer" card (secret). One is guilty.  
    - "Suspect Yourself" card: Take 1 Evidence token.  
    - "Suspect Others" card: All other players take 1 Evidence token.  
    - "Destroy Evidence" card: Keep; at end, discard 1 (1 card), 3 (2 cards), 5 (3 cards), or +1 per extra.  
    - "Remove Evidence" token: Discard 1 other token.  
    - Endgame: Murderer takes 2 more tokens. All reveal. Player with most fingerprints is eliminated. If Murderer avoided elimination, gains +20 VP.  
  - **Module D (Passengers & Baggage)**:  
    - Assign to first free car (passenger: upper, baggage: lower).  
    - Bonus triggers when: car ≥1-point AND Conductor passed it.  
    - Passenger: Gain coins (one-time + 1 per prior passenger).  
    - Baggage: Gain VP (one-time + 2 per prior baggage).  
  - **Module E (Switches & Mechanics)**:  
    - Place in gap between trains (1st between cars 1–2, 2nd between 3–4, etc.). Can cover old.  
    - **Switch**: In scoring, earn VP if pointed car is upgraded and Conductor passed.  
    - **Mechanic**: Immediate bonus. When left car meets upgrade req, upgrade right car. Flip when both done.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Intermediate Scoring (after Rounds 2, 4, 6)**:  
  1. **Route Bonuses**: For each "Bonus" city space Locomotive has reached or passed, collect bonus once. Can collect in any order. If Locomotive moves during scoring and passes new bonus, collect immediately.  
  2. **Train Points**: For each Train Car (except Mail) and Locomotive tile that Conductor has reached or passed, score face value. Sum both trains.  
  - May fulfill contracts or spend coins before/during scoring.  
- **Final Scoring (after Round 6)**:  
  - 1 VP per Coin on player board.  
  - End of Game Cards:  
    - Group by type (Train Car, Conductor, Locomotive).  
    - For each type:  
      - Count number of Base Game ("X") cards of that type you have.  
      - Sum VP values on End of Game cards of that type.  
      - Multiply: (count) × (sum) = VP for that type.  
    - Total all three types.  
  - Unfulfilled contracts score nothing.  
- **Winner**: Highest total VP wins. Tie: all tied players win.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **No 0-point Train Cars in supply?** Take a 0-point car from one of your trains (rightmost) and place it where needed. Replace with new one when supply available.  
- **No Evidence tokens left?** (Module C) Draw at random from player with most. If tie, active player draws first, then clockwise.  
- **Can I spend coins between Postcard bonus actions?** Yes. A Postcard doubles a Route card’s bonus as two separate action frames. You may spend coins between them.  
- **Can I upgrade a car in a completed train?** Yes. Adding a Locomotive tile stops adding cars, but upgrades are allowed.  
- **Can a player earn Constantinople points twice?** Yes. Each Conductor (upper and lower) can independently be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd to reach a Locomotive. Place cubes accordingly.  
- **What if I can’t perform all actions on a card?** Do as much as you can. Unused actions are lost.  
- **Can I take Start Player tile and keep it if I’m already Start Player?** Yes. You remain Start Player and gain the tile’s bonuses.
