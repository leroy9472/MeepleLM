## Port Royal - Solitaire Variant (Comprehensive Reference Manual)

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Port Royal – Solitaire Variant*, you play as a lone trader in the bustling Caribbean port, competing against a dummy AI opponent. The dummy player does not build a tableau but participates mechanically to simulate multiplayer dynamics. The objective is to score more victory points than the dummy player after two full passes through the deck.

### 2. Components  
- Standard *Port Royal* deck:  
  - 50 Ship cards (5 nationalities/colors)  
  - 60 Person cards (including Settler, Captain, Priest, Trader, etc.)  
  - 6 Expedition cards  
  - 4 Tax Increase cards  
- 1 six-sided die (d6)  
- Coins (at least 20 recommended)  
- Discard pile area  
- Personal tableau for solo player  

---

### 3. Setup  
- Each player (including the dummy) starts with **3 coins**.  
- Shuffle the deck to form the draw pile.

- The dummy player has no hand or tableau but maintains a virtual coin supply.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players alternate turns. On each turn:

#### A. Solo Player Turn (if active):  
1. **Discovery Phase**: Reveal cards one at a time into the harbor until you choose to stop or **bust** (reveal two ships of the same nationality).  
   - If an **Expedition** is drawn, set it aside (only active player can fulfill).  
   - If a **Tax Increase** is drawn, resolve immediately (see Scoring & End Game).  
2. **Trade & Hire Phase**:  
   - Based on number of different ship colors in harbor (0–3: 1 card, 4: 2 cards, 5: 3 cards), you may take that many cards.  
   - For each card taken:  
     - **Trade**: Take coin value from a Ship card.  
     - **Hire**: Pay hire cost to take a Person card into your tableau.  
   - Pay **1 coin to the dummy player** per card taken.  
   - Use Person abilities immediately (e.g., Admiral, Governor).  

#### B. Dummy Player Turn (if active):  
1. **Discovery Phase**:  
   - Roll a d6. Draw that many cards into the harbor.  
     - If an **Expedition** is drawn, set it aside and continue drawing.  
     - If a **Tax Increase** is drawn, resolve and discard, then continue drawing.  
   - Do not bust — duplicates allowed.  
2. **Trade & Hire Phase**:  
   - The dummy may take **up to 1 card** from the harbor.  
   - The dummy follows a strict AI logic:  
     - **Case A**: Cannot afford any Person and no Ships to trade → gains 1 coin and ends turn.  
     - **Case B**: Cannot afford any Person but Ships available → takes the Ship giving the most coins (leftmost in case of tie).  
     - **Case C**: Can afford Person(s) but no Ships → hires the most valuable (highest VP) affordable Person. Tiebreak: cheapest, then leftmost.  
     - **Case D**: Can afford Person(s) and Ships available → rolls d6. If roll ≥ solo player’s current coin total, takes best Ship; else hires best Person.  
   - If taking a card during solo player’s turn (passive role), dummy must:  
     - Pay 1 coin to solo player.  
     - Only hire a Person if it can pay the solo player.  
     - Only take a Ship if it gives **at least 2 coins** (net gain of 1 after paying solo).  

#### C. After Dummy's Turn:  
- Remaining cards stay in harbor until next Discovery Phase.  
- Proceed to next turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Expeditions  
- Set aside when drawn.  
- To fulfill: discard required symbols (Settler, Captain, Priest, or Jack of All Trades).  
- Only **active player** can fulfill an Expedition.  
- Dummy player **can fulfill** Expeditions when active.  

#### Tax Increase  
- When drawn, all players with **12 or more coins** halve their coins (round down).  
- Then, the player with **fewest coins** takes 1 coin from the bank.  
  - If tied, **both players** take 1 coin.  
- Ignore sword or VP effects on Tax cards.  

#### Person Abilities (Solo Player Only)  
- **Trader**: +1 coin when trading a ship of matching color.  
- **Merchant**: +1 VP per matching-color ship traded (end game).  
- **Clerk**: Draw +1 card when taking a matching-color ship.  
- **Sailor/Pirate**: Use swords to repel ships during Discovery.  
- **Mademoiselle**: -1 to hire cost (min 0).  
- **Jester**: Gain 1 coin if no cards available on opponent’s turn.  
- **Admiral**: +2 coins if 5+ cards in harbor on your turn.  
- **Vice Admiral**: +1 coin if 3–4 cards in harbor.  
- **Gunner**: Gain coins equal to number of ships in harbor minus 1.  
- **Governor**: Take 1 extra card (pay 1 coin per card to active player).  
- **Passenger**: Worth VP at end game (value on card).  

> Note: **Dummy player does not use Person abilities.**

#### Bust Condition  
- Only applies to **solo player** during their Discovery Phase.  
- Drawing two ships of the same nationality ends the turn immediately.  
- Dummy player **does not bust** — may have duplicate ships.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End Trigger**: When the draw deck is empty for the **second time**, the game ends.  
  - First time: shuffle discard pile to form new draw deck.  
  - Second time: complete current turn, then ensure both players have had equal turns.  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - Count victory points from:  
    - Person cards in tableau (shield value).  
    - Expeditions fulfilled (each worth 3 VP).  
    - Merchant cards: +1 VP per matching-color ship traded.  
    - Passenger cards: as marked.  
  - **Governors**: Worth **-2 VP each** in extended scoring (per Extended Game Variant).  
- **Winner**: Player with **more VP** wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Most coins.  

> Note: In this solitaire variant, **12 VP does not trigger game end** — only deck exhaustion does.
