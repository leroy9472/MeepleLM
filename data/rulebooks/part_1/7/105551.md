## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Archipelago is set during the Age of Discovery (1492–1797), where players take on the role of explorers commissioned by European nations to discover, colonize, and exploit islands. The goal is to balance expansion and commercial gain with the well-being of the local population to avoid rebellion. The game ends when a secret end-game condition is met or if the archipelago gains independence due to rebellion. Victory is determined by scoring victory points (VP) based on secret objectives, public trends, and built wonders.

### 3. Setup

3. Colony Stability (III): Place Population and Rebellion markers at 0.
4. Surplus Workers (IV): Place marker at 0.
5. Form 3 piles of 8 Explorer tokens each.
6. Shuffle Evolution deck and place face-down; place top 5 cards on Evolution track (readable orientation).

12. Determine random starting player order.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn proceeds in 6 phases:
1. **Disengagement**: Untap evolution cards, disengage harvesting units, stand up rebels.
2. **Order of Play**: Players blind bid florins; highest bidder sets turn order. Ties: rebid once, then order unchanged.
3. **Population Effects**: Apply effects from Boards I–IV in order:
   - Board I (Domestic Market): Excess resources increase surplus workers or rebellion.
   - Board II (Export Market): Excess resources increase surplus workers.
   - Board III (Colony Stability): Population level increases surplus workers and/or rebellion.
   - Board IV (Surplus Workers): High surplus increases rebellion.
4. **Balance of the Archipelago** (skip Turn 1):
   - Reveal top Evolution card back (ignore red zones).
   - **Domestic Crisis**: All citizens become rebels. Players contribute resources (from domestic market or personal stock) to stand up citizens (rate per card). Each remaining rebel increases Rebellion by 1.
   - **Export Crisis**: Players contribute to export demand. Shortfall increases Rebellion by 1 per missing resource.
   - **Event**: Resolve as described (e.g., move Rebellion down based on temples).
5. **Actions**:
   - Players take turns placing action discs on action wheel until all are spent.
   - On a player’s turn, they may:
     - Perform one main action (by placing disc)
     - Use one evolution card
     - Use one market or port (but not both)
   - Action types:
     - **Taxes** (limited): Gain income per active unit and building. Rebellion +1.
     - **Harvest** (unlimited): Assign active non-engaged units to harvest one resource type. Ships only harvest fish. Requires permission if region controlled by opponent via town. Units become engaged.
     - **Transaction** (unlimited): Buy or sell one resource on domestic or export market.
     - **Exploration** (limited): Choose top or second tile from deck. Must place adjacent to at least two existing tiles and connect landscape. Must have adjacent active unit to move to new tile. Gain explorer token, place one resource in domestic market, take one behind screen, increase surplus workers by number of huts.
     - **Reproduction** (once per player per turn): In each region with exactly 2 active citizens, add a third. Population increases. Rebels do not reproduce.
     - **Recruitment** (unlimited): Pay current rate on Surplus Workers board to hire workers. Place in regions where you have active units. Max 3 citizens per player per region.
     - **Migration** (unlimited): Move active non-engaged units to adjacent region or unoccupied building. Sea convoys allowed with own ships (ships can link for multi-hex transport).
     - **Construction** (unlimited): Build ship, town, market, port, or temple. Requires active non-engaged citizen (ship can build port). Builder becomes engaged (except when building a ship).
6. **Evolution Card Purchase**:
   - Each player must choose:
     - Buy one card and rotate one other card, or
     - Rotate two cards
   - Rotated card with skull facing arrow is discarded.
   - Refill empty slots from Evolution deck.
   - If a red-bordered crisis/event is revealed, resolve it immediately.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Engaged Units**: Units that have performed an action that engages them (harvest, construction, market/port use). They remain on resources/buildings until Disengagement phase.
- **Active vs Rebel Citizens**: Active citizens stand; rebels lie down. Rebels cannot act or contribute to income.
- **3-Citizen Limit**: Max 3 citizens per player per region.
- **Control**:
  - A building is controlled by having an active unit on it.
  - A town grants control of the entire region, including other buildings.
  - Controlling a town allows indirect control of market/port/temple in region.
- **Sea Convoys**: Ships allow citizens to cross water. Ship does not use migration action.
- **Explorer Tokens**: Can be converted into any one resource during a crisis or action requiring resources.
- **Evolution Cards**:
  - **Character/Progress Cards**: Activated by paying cost and tapping (rotating). Rainbow arrow = usable by others (pay owner +1f).
  - **Wonders**: Built, not activated. Pay cost, spend action discs, place citizen (removed from game). Worth VP if built.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End Game Triggers** (immediate end at end of current player’s turn):
- Any player meets their secret end-game condition (e.g., 3 explorer piles exhausted, population ≥20, etc.).
- Rebellion marker passes Population marker → Archipelago Independence.

**Who Wins?**
- If Independence and no Separatist: All lose.
- If Independence and Separatist present: Separatist wins alone.
- Otherwise: All win; determine Grand Winner by VP.

**Scoring**:
1. **Objective Cards** (all players):
   - Reveal all non-Separatist/Pacifist objective cards.
   - For each, rank players by victory condition (top 3 score: 3, 2, 1 VP).
   - Ties: both get points; next rank not skipped.
2. **Trend Card**:
   - Score 2–4 VP based on ranking (e.g., temples controlled).
   - **Benefactor Variant**: Score based on florins placed during game (4/3/2 VP).
3. **Evolution Cards**:
   - Built wonders: VP as shown.
   - Character cards (e.g., King, Pope): VP as shown.

**Tiebreaker**: Most money behind screen.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you harvest in a region with a town controlled by another player?** Yes, with permission.
- **Can you use a market and port in the same round?** No, only one per round.
- **Can you build and use a market in the same round?** Yes. Building engages the citizen, but you can still use the market that round by engaging the same citizen.
- **Can rebels reproduce?** No.
- **What happens if you can’t place an explored tile?** Action fails; tile is discarded.
- **Can you use another player’s evolution card?** Only if it has a rainbow arrow. Pay activation cost +1f to owner.
- **Does using a port/market require an unengaged unit?** No, but the unit becomes engaged.
- **Can a temple prevent rebellion in its region?** Yes. Temple occupants never rebel. Controller can stand up all local rebels for free during a crisis.
- **Can you recruit if surplus workers is 0?** No.
- **Can you harvest fish with a citizen?** No, only ships.
