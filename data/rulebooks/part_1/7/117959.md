## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Set in the royal court of Versailles between 1670 and 1690, players take on the roles of courtiers vying for influence and favor from key members of the French royal family. By strategically placing dice representing their influence, players earn favors that grant advancements in five key areas: Fortune, Lands, Influence, Reroll, Titles, and Charges. The ultimate goal is to gain the highest rank in Charges by the end of the game, proving oneself the most powerful courtier.

### 2. Components  
- Printed game board featuring characters of the royal court (e.g., King, Queen, King’s Mother, etc.), each associated with a number from 1 to 6.  
- Pencil (for tracking scores; optional if using dice variant).  
- Colored six-sided dice: one set of 6 dice per player (each player chooses a color).  
- White six-sided dice: used to represent neutral courtiers.  

### 3. Setup  
- Each player selects a color and receives 6 dice of that color.  
- All players roll one die. Place each die on the board space matching its number (e.g., a roll of 3 goes to the character labeled "3").  
- Remove any dice that match in number and color (i.e., eliminate duplicates? Clarification needed — see Edge Cases).  
- The player whose remaining die is closest to the King (as defined by board layout) becomes the first player.  
- Each player starts with:  
  - Influence: 1 (minimum to remain in court)  
  - All other scores (Fortune, Lands, Titles, Charges, Reroll): 0  

At the beginning of each turn, players receive dice:  
- Base: 2 colored dice + 2 white dice = 4 dice total.  
- Influence modifies this:  
  - For each point of Influence (max 6), gain +1 die (up to 6 dice total).  
  - If Influence grants fewer than 4 dice, supplement with white dice to reach 4.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game lasts 6 turns (4 in Blitz variant). One turn consists of the following phases:

#### Phase 1: Dice Distribution  
- All players receive dice based on current Influence (minimum 4 dice, up to 6).  
- Composed of colored and white dice as per rules above.

#### Phase 2: Dice Rolling and Placement (in turn order)  
- Starting with the first player, each player rolls all their dice.  
- Group all dice showing the same number.  
- Place all dice of a given number onto the board space corresponding to that number (e.g., all 5s go to “King’s Mother” if she is labeled 5).  
- Only dice of the same number are placed; remaining dice (unmatched numbers) are kept.  
- Players take turns repeating this process until all dice have been rolled and placed.  

> Note: Players may re-roll retained dice in subsequent rounds of the same turn (see Core Mechanics).

#### Phase 3: Favor Resolution  
After all dice are placed, resolve each character space (numbered 1–6):  
- On each space, determine which player has the most dice of their color.  
- Only consider dice of a single number — the number matching the space.  
- White dice are treated as a neutral player.  
- If multiple colors tie for highest count, **all non-matching dice are eliminated**, and **no player gains the favor**.  
- If white dice win the space, **no player gains the favor**.  
- The winner (if any) earns one favor from that character.  

A player **can only gain one favor per character**, even if they dominate multiple numbers. They **choose which type of favor** they receive.

#### Phase 4: Claiming Favors  
Favors are awarded in fixed order:  
1. Queen (Marie Anne d'Autriche)  
2. King’s Mother  
3. King’s Brother  
4. King’s Wife  
5. King’s Mistress  
6. King  

Each player who won a character’s favor chooses one of the following benefits:

- **Fortune**: +1 Fortune. Can be spent later to acquire Titles or Charges.  
- **Lands**: +1 Lands. Required for acquiring Titles.  
- **Influence**: +1 Influence. Increases dice per turn. If Influence reaches 0, the player is eliminated.  
- **Reroll**: +1 Reroll token. Can be used to re-roll all or part of a throw; after use, reduce Reroll score by 1.  
- **Titles**: +1 Title, **only if** current Fortune + Lands ≥ new Title value. If Fortune is used, reduce Fortune by the amount contributed.  
- **Charges**: +1 Charge, **only if** current Fortune + Title ≥ new Charge value. If Fortune is used, reduce Fortune by the amount contributed.  

> Players cannot exceed 6 in any favor category.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Dice Placement**: Dice must be placed on the board space matching their face value. All dice showing the same number must be placed together on that number’s space.  
- **Favor Competition**: Per space, only the dominant color (most dice) wins. Ties eliminate all involved parties. White dice can block wins.  
- **Score Limits**: No category may exceed 6 points.  
- **Resource Spending**:  
  - Fortune is a flexible resource used to meet thresholds for Titles and Charges but is consumed when used.  
  - Lands and Titles are prerequisites for advancement.  
- **Rerolls**: Players may spend a Reroll token at any time during their roll phase to re-roll any subset of their dice.  
- **Elimination**: If Influence drops to 0, the player is out of the court and removed from the game. (See Variants for Vengeance option.)

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends after **6 turns** (or 4 in Blitz variant).  
- Final ranking:  
  1. Highest **Charge** score wins.  
  2. If tied, highest **Title** score breaks the tie.  
  3. If still tied, highest **Fortune** score breaks the tie.  
  4. If still tied, **all players lose** — none managed to secure lasting power.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: What happens during initial setup if multiple players roll the same number?**  
  A: The rules state to “eliminate matching dice,” but it's ambiguous whether this refers to same number or same number and color. Most likely interpretation: remove dice that match in number — regardless of color — leaving the highest unique roll. If all match, continue rerolling until one stands out.  

- **Q: Can a player gain multiple favors from the same character?**  
  A: No. A player may only gain **one favor per character**, even if they dominate multiple rolls on that space over time.  

- **Q: Can you have more than 6 dice in hand?**  
  A: No. Maximum dice per turn is 6, even if Influence would grant more.  

- **Q: Can you use Reroll tokens outside your turn?**  
  A: No. Rerolls can only be used during your own roll phase.  

- **Q: What happens if a player cannot claim a favor due to cap (e.g., already at 6 Lands)?**  
  A: The player must choose a different favor type that is not maxed out. If all are maxed, no favor is taken.  

- **Q: Can eliminated players interact further?**  
  A: Only in **Vengeance variant**: eliminated players roll 4 white dice per turn, potentially blocking others.
