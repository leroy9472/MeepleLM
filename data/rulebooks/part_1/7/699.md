## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
This document compiles multiple house rules, custom systems, and errata for the board game *HeroQuest*. The core objective across all variants remains consistent with the original game: heroes explore dungeons, complete quest objectives, and survive encounters with monsters controlled by the Evil Wizard (Zargon). Players may use these rules to customize heroes, expand gameplay mechanics, introduce progression systems, or modify core rules for increased complexity or balance.

The overarching goal for players is to succeed in quests by overcoming traps, monsters, and puzzles. These supplemental rules allow for greater character customization, strategic depth, and long-term campaign progression.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Combat
- **Attack**: Roll combat dice equal to weapon or ability value. Each skull = 1 hit.
- **Defend**: Target rolls combat dice equal to defense value (base 2 + armor/shield bonuses). Each white shield cancels one hit.
- **Unarmed Combat**: 1 combat die to attack; defender rolls +1 die.
- **Ranged Attacks**: Require line of sight. Adjacent enemies may block unless Point Blank Shot is known.
- **Diagonal Attacks**: Only allowed if weapon or ability permits.

#### Line of Sight
- Measured from center of square to center of square.
- Blocked by walls, furniture, and doors.
- Corners may be grazed only once; grazing two corners blocks LOS.
- Figures do not block LOS when revealing room contents or searching.

#### Traps
Types include:
- **Pit Trap**: 1 BP damage, ends turn.
- **Falling Block**: 3 dice attack; each skull = 1 BP damage.
- **Spear Trap**: 1 die attack; skull = 1 BP damage.
- **Teleport Trap**: Moves hero from A to B.
- **Jumping a Trap**: Roll 1 die; skull triggers trap.
- **Disarming**: Roll 1 die; success avoids triggering (modified by skills/toolkit).

#### Searching
- **Treasure**: Roll 2D6 on Treasure Chart (in HQSE2.0b) or draw Treasure Card.
- **Traps/Secret Doors**: Zargon makes concealed Perception roll (HQSE2.0b), or player rolls based on class (Zargon’s House Rules).
- Rooms can be searched multiple times if furniture is present (HeroQuest XP).

#### Spellcasting
- **Mage**: Uses mana points (3 × Mind); no roll to cast.
- **Cleric**: Must roll D6 ≥ spell level to succeed; limited uses per spell level.
- **Bard**: Uses lyre; rolls D6 for song success.
- **Scrolls**: One-time use; require Lore skill.
- **Spell Access**: Requires minimum Mind score (e.g., Mind 6+ for Amethyst spells).

#### Movement
- Standard: 2D6 if monsters in sight; variable otherwise (Zargon’s House Rules).
- Reduced by 1 per 2 BP damage.
- Diagonal movement allowed; cannot move over corners.
- Run Action adds D6 to movement.

#### Carrying Capacity
- Equal to 10 − Strength.
- Exceeding reduces movement and Dexterity rolls.
- Max 3 points over capacity.

#### Poison
- Lose 1 BP at end of each turn.
- Stopped by antidote, leaving dungeon, or Neutralize Poison.
- Not cumulative.
- Affects only living creatures.

#### Attributes and Rolls
- **Strength (Str)**: Used for breaking doors, smashing chests.
- **Dexterity (Dex)**: Used for dodging, thieving, trap disarming.
- **Perception (Prc)**: Used for detecting traps and secret doors.
- Roll D6; success if ≥ value on sheet (e.g., 4+). 6 always succeeds, 1 always fails.
