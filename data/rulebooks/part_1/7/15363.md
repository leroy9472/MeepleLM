## Nexus Ops Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the year 2315, galactic corporations race to control a moon rich in Rubium, a powerful energy source. Players command factions—Ares Inc., Black Helix, Galactic Syndicate, Zyborg Technologies—deploying troops, exploring terrain, and completing missions. The objective is to be the first to earn 12 Victory Points (VPs) by completing Secret Missions, Mission cards, or through alternate victory conditions. The game ends immediately when a player reaches 12 VPs or when a player is eliminated.

2. Components  
- 164 Plastic Figures:  
  - 48 Humans, 32 Fungoids, 32 Crystallines, 24 Rock Striders, 16 Lava Leapers, 12 Rubium Dragons  
- 4 Player Boards (one per faction)  
- 108 Cards:  
  - 40 Mission Cards  
  - 36 Secret Mission Cards  
  - 32 Energize Cards  
- Game Board Tiles:  
  - 6 single-hex, 6 double-hex, 4 triple-hex (home bases)  
- Monolith Tile and 3D Monolith  
- 24 Exploration Tokens (standard and 6 with blue borders for optional use)  
- 65 Rubium Gems (50 × 1, 15 × 5)  
- 6 Dice  
- 1 First Player Token (for Vortex variant)  

3. Setup  
1. Randomly determine the first player.  
2. Each player selects a color and takes matching units and player board.  
3. Place the 3D Monolith in the center. Surround it with 6 single-hex tiles in a ring, then 6 double-hex tiles in an outer ring. Attach home-base tiles according to player count (diagram-based).  
4. Shuffle Secret Mission and Energize decks; place near the board.  
5. Place one face-down Exploration token on each of the 18 non-home-base hexes.  
6. Starting rubium: First player gets 8; each subsequent player gets 3 more (e.g., 8, 11, 14, 17 in 4-player).  
7. First player receives the Starting Player Marker.

4. Gameplay Flow (per player turn)  
1. **Deploy**: Purchase units using Rubium. Place them on any of your home base hexes. Play Deploy Phase Energize cards.  
2. **Move**: Move each unit one hex. Some units have special movement (e.g., Rock Striders move 2).  
3. **Explore**: Flip face-down Exploration tokens in hexes you occupy.  
   - Unit: Add one of that type to the hex.  
   - Mine: Leave token as a mine.  
   - Both: Add unit and leave mine.  
4. **Fight**: Resolve battles in contested hexes you’re in.  
   - Battles occur in Order of Battle (right to left on player board: Rubium Dragons → Lava Leapers → Rock Striders → Crystallines → Fungoids → Humans).  
   - Units attack simultaneously by type.  
   - Attacker wins if they eliminate all defender’s units. Defender draws 1 Energize card if eliminated on another’s turn.  
5. **Income**: Gain Rubium equal to mine value for each mine you control with at least one Human, Fungoid, or Crystalline.  
6. **Draw**:  
   - Draw 1 Secret Mission card. May play immediately if condition met.  
   - If you control the Monolith, draw 2 Energize cards.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Controlled vs Contested**: A hex is controlled by a player if only they have units there. Contested if multiple players have units.  
- **Dragon Breath**: At end of Move phase, Rubium Dragon in controlled hex may breathe into adjacent hex. Roll ≥4 to destroy one unit (target chooses casualty). Not a battle; no card play or Energize draw.  
- **Energize Cards**:  
  - Draw 1 when you lose a battle on another’s turn.  
  - Draw 2 if you control Monolith at end of your turn.  
  - Deploy Phase cards: Play only during Deploy.  
  - Battle cards: Any player may play during battle; attacker first, then defender, then clockwise.  
- **Secret Mission Cards**: Play only on your turn when condition is met. Only one red-VP card per battle win.  
- **Faction Powers**:  
  - **Ares Inc.**: Artillery – Adjacent Humans can fire into battle if uncontested.  
  - **Black Helix**: Cloning – Gain 1 free Human per 2 lost (next turn).  
  - **Galactic Syndicate**: Banking – Gain 1 extra Rubium per 2 unspent.  
  - **Zyborg**: Cyber Augmentation – Humans move 2 through explored, uncontested terrain.  
- **Monolith Powers**:  
  - Ares: Guided Missiles – Humans attack up to 2 hexes away, +1 to rolls.  
  - Black Helix: Gene Splicing – Gain Rock Strider per 2 Fungoids/Crystallines lost.  
  - Galactic Syndicate: Speculative Investment – Gain 3 extra Rubium + mine value when taking mine.  
  - Zyborg: Rubium Exoskeleton – Humans add +2 to rolls, attack during Rock Strider phase.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory Points**: Earned from Secret Mission and Mission cards.  
- **Win Conditions**:  
  1. A player reaches 12 or more VPs → wins immediately.  
  2. A player is eliminated (no units, insufficient Rubium/cards to buy more) → remaining player with most VPs wins.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Most controlled hexes.  
  2. Most units on board.  
  3. Game is a draw if still tied.  
- Optional VP thresholds: 10 (faster) or 14 (longer) VPs.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Critical Objective**: Play after battle ends if both sides have survivors. Triggers new battle; previous battle cards do not carry over.  
- **Frenzy**: Playing two in one battle has no extra effect.  
- **Outflank**: Can be played any time before dice are rolled for that unit type.  
- **Multiplayer Battles**: Attacker chooses one defender. Eliminating that defender = win, even if others remain.  
- **Mutual Destruction**: Attacker wins, defender draws Energize card.  
- **Discarding Cards**: Any time during your turn, discard Secret Mission or Energize cards for 1 Rubium each.  
- **Team Play (4-player)**: Teams of two, sitting opposite. Win at 20 combined VPs. Pass one card to teammate after Draw phase.  
- **Vortex Variant**: Replaces Monolith. Units are sucked and blown between hexes; one hex is destroyed each turn. No unit entry.  
- **Intercepted Transmissions**: Secret Missions are public. Active player fulfills one, then refills line.  
- **Alternate Units**: Back of player boards used. Includes Clones, Shardians, Sporlings, etc., with special rules.
