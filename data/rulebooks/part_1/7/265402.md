# IN THE HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN KING  
**Comprehensive Reference Manual**

### 1. Lore & Objective
Generations after being driven from their ancestral home beneath the mountain by Gnomes, the trolls feel the mountain collapse and call to return. As a leader, you rally trolls from the Mud, Fire, Ice, and Moon clans to reclaim the ruins, rebuild the kingdom, and earn honour through excavation, statue recovery, and great hall construction. The player with the most honour at the end of the game becomes the Mountain King.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Recruit trolls to generate a cascading flow of resources.
- Excavate tunnels using minerals to score honour.
- Move statues toward the mountain’s heart and place them on matching clan pedestals for bonus points.
- Dedicate Great Halls to score large endgame points.
- Be the first or second to complete your trollsmoot (10 trolls) to earn Coronation tokens.

   - 6 starter troll cards
   - Gate tile
   - Score marker
B. Place score markers at 0 on track.

D. **Build Starting Trollsmoot**:
   - Shuffle 6 starter troll cards.
   - Draw 2, choose 1 to place in a slot on mat; keep other in hand.
   - Repeat until 4 trolls are placed (1 card left unseen in deck).
   - Gain starting (bottom-row) resources from chosen trolls.
   - Slide mat up to hide starting resources.
   - Bonus resources:
     - 2nd/3rd players: gain starting resources from card in hand
     - 4th/5th players: gain from hand + unseen card
   - Return unused starter trolls to box.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, perform these steps in order:

#### 1. Spells & Workshops (Optional)
- **Cast 1 Spell**:
  - Spend 1 Rune on any face-up spell in spellbook.
  - Resolve effect.
  - If 3rd Rune is placed, return spell to bottom of deck; draw new one.
- **Activate 1 Workshop**:
  - Your network must touch at least one entrance of the workshop.
  - Activate once per open entrance (regardless of who controls them).
  - Each activation is independent.
  - Resources gained go to your storage.

#### 2. Recruit or Dig (Must Do One)
**If you have 10 trolls, you must Dig.  
If you lack minerals to Dig, you must Recruit.  
If neither possible, skip.**

- **Recruit a Troll**:
  1. **Choose Troll**:
     - Level-1: Free
     - Level-2: Spend 1 Coin bribe on each of the 2 Level-1 trolls beneath it (2 total)
     - Level-3: Spend 1 Coin on each of 2 Level-2 and 3 Level-1 trolls beneath (5 total)
  2. **Take Troll**:
     - Remove chosen troll; gain all bribes on it.
     - Replace with new troll from same level deck.
     - If Level-2: gain pedestal from it; place random one from bag on replacement.
     - If Level-3: take any available pedestal from bag; place reminder token on replacement.
  3. **Retire Trolls**:
     - Any horde troll with 4 bribes retires: discard to bottom of deck, return bribes, replace.
  4. **Add to Trollsmoot & Cascade**:
     - Place new troll above and between two existing trolls.
     - Activate: new troll + all directly beneath it in pyramid (downward cascade).
     - Each activated troll gains resources (from supply) for symbols not already covered.

- **Dig a Tunnel**:
  1. Choose tunnel tile from supply.
  2. **Pay Cost**: Spend number of identical minerals = number of squares in tile.
  3. **Score Honour**: Use chart on player mat (based on mineral and size).
  4. **Place Tunnel**:
     - Must be adjacent to your network (gate, tunnel, or great hall).
     - Cannot touch opponent's network (diagonal OK).
     - Cannot go off board or overlap tiles/workshops/heart.
  5. **Rubble Spaces**: Spend 1 Hammer per rubble space covered.
  6. **Buried Statues**: Unearthed statues are placed on same space in new tunnel.
  7. **Buried Resources**: Gain immediately to storage.
  8. **Add Pedestal?**:
     - If tunnel has anchor (hole), and you have matching clan pedestal, may place it.
     - **Restriction**: Only 1 pedestal per clan per mountain tier (5 tiers: dark gray → yellow).
     - Gain matching pedestal point token (face down, worth honour at end).
     - Must place pedestal immediately; cannot add later.
  9. **Establish Workshop?**:
     - If new tunnel is adjacent to empty workshop site, place any available workshop there.

#### 3. Great Hall (Optional)
- Take 1 Great Hall from supply.
- Place it over existing tunnels in your network.
- Covered tunnels must exactly match hall’s shape and size (no gaps).
- No cost.
- **Effects**:
  - Any covered pedestals are removed (you keep point tokens; restriction remains).
  - Statues remain in same positions.
  - Great hall counts as a tunnel for adjacency.
  - Protruding tunnel sections become separate tunnels.
  - Hall scores:
    - Smaller number if altar is empty.
    - Larger number if any statue is on altar (only one statue per hall scores).

#### 4. Move Statues (Optional)
- Spend carts to move unearthed statues in your network.
- 1 cart = 1 move:
  - To another space in same tunnel, OR
  - To any space in adjacent tunnel (orthogonal only).
- **Tunnel Definition**:
  - Tunnel tile
  - Great hall tile
  - Gate
  - Tunnel portion under a great hall
- **Cart Types**:
  - Clan cart (Fire/Ice/Moon symbol): move only matching clan statue
  - Wild cart (spiral or in storage): move any statue
- Only 1 statue per tunnel tile scores at endgame.

#### * Trading with Supply (Any Time)
- Spend any 4 resources → gain 1 resource of your choice from supply to storage.
- May do multiple times per turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Trollsmoot**: Pyramid of trolls (max 10) that generate resources via cascades when new troll is added.
- **Network**: Connected tunnels, great halls, and gate. Workshops are not part of network.
- **Adjacency**: Orthogonal only (no diagonals).
- **Resource Spending**: Spent resources return to supply. Prefer spending from trolls to free them for regeneration.
- **Pedestal Placement**:
  - Only on anchors during tunnel placement.
  - One per clan per tier.
  - Doubles statue value if matching clan is placed on it.
- **Workshops**:
  - Access via network adjacency.
  - May activate once per open entrance.
  - 11 types (e.g., Cartwright, Runesmithy, Toolforge) allow resource conversion.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### Game End Trigger
- First player to recruit 10th troll takes Coronation token (5 honour).
- Second player to do so takes second token (3 honour) → triggers endgame.
- In 2-player: only 3-honour token; triggers endgame when taken.
- After second token is claimed:
  - Finish current round.
  - Each player gets 2 more turns.
  - Then final scoring.

#### Final Scoring
Add to in-game honour:
1. **Coronation Tokens**:
   - 5 honour (first)
   - 3 honour (second)
2. **Pedestal Point Tokens**: Reveal and add values.
3. **Leftover Resource Sets**:
   - Move all resources from trolls to storage (clan carts become wild).
   - Form sets of 3 identical resources = 1 honour each.
   - May trade 4:1 with supply first to complete sets.
4. **Great Halls**:
   - Smaller value if altar empty.
   - Larger value if any statue is on altar.
5. **Statues**:
   - Each tunnel (including gate) may score 1 unearthed statue.
   - Score based on tier (from outer to inner: dark gray → yellow).
   - **Basic Value**:
     - Dark gray: 1
     - Gray: 2
     - Brown: 4
     - Orange: 7
     - Yellow: 10
   - **On Matching Pedestal**: Double value.
   - Statues in great halls only score via hall’s altar (not tier-based).

#### Example Final Score
- Tunnels: 43
- Coronation: 3
- Pedestal points: 11
- Resource sets: 1
- Great halls: 0 + 15 = 15
- Statues: 20 (Fire, yellow, pedestal) + 10 (Ice, yellow) + 8 (Fire, light gray, pedestal) = 38  
**Total: 111**

#### Winning
- Highest total honour wins.
- **Tiebreaker**: Lowest sum of levels of recruited trolls.
