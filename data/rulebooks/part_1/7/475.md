## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the early 18th century, the Grand Mogul empire is collapsing. Players take on the roles of Maharishis and princes vying for control over northwestern India. The goal is to gain the most influence by strategically placing palaces, collecting goods, and winning influence over provinces and cities. The player with the highest score after 12 provinces are visited wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Game board (12 provinces, 49 cities, scoring track)  
- 12 Octagonal province tiles  
- 16 Bonus tiles (15 square, 1 Taj Mahal +4)  
- 24 Oval influence tiles (6 each of Vizier, General, Monk, Princess)  
- 1 Gold ring (crown)  
- 100 Palaces (20 per color, 5 colors)  
- 5 Scoring markers  
- 100 Cards:  
  - 84 Colored cards (21 each in red, yellow, green, violet; 2 symbols per card)  
  - 12 White cards (1 symbol each)  
  - 4 Special cards (different back; +1 Elephant, +1 Grand Mogul, +2 Points, Free Color Change)  
- 2 Black figures (current province, starting player)  
- 1 Pedestal (to hold province tile)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place province tile #12 in the Agra province. Shuffle and randomly place the remaining 11 province tiles in other provinces.  
2. Place the Taj Mahal +4 bonus tile on the fortress city of Agra. Shuffle the other 15 bonus tiles and place one face-up on each of the remaining 16 fortress cities.  
3. Place one of each oval influence tile (Vizier, General, Monk, Princess) and the crown in the Court area (upper-right corner).  
4. Place the 4 special cards face-up beside the board.  
5. Shuffle the 96 normal cards (84 colored + 12 white).  
6. Deal 6 cards face-down to each player.  
7. Set up card supply:  
   - 3 players → 5 face-up cards  
   - 4 players → 7 face-up cards  
   - 5 players → 9 face-up cards  
   Place the rest as a draw pile.  
8. Each player chooses a color, takes all palaces of that color, and places their scoring marker at 0.  
9. Place the current province marker on province #1.  
10. Randomly choose the starting player and give them the starting player marker.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of 12 visits, one per province in numerical order.

#### Each Visit:
1. **Prepare the Visit**  
   - Move the current province marker to the next province.  
   - Move that province’s tile to the Court area (on the pedestal).  
   - Replace any missing influence tiles and the crown in the Court.  
   - Lay out a fresh card supply (same number as initial setup).

2. **Player Turns (Clockwise)**  
   Starting with the starting player, each player on their turn must:  
   a) **Play 1 or 2 cards**, or  
   b) **Withdraw** from the visit.

   - **Playing Cards**:  
     - First card must be a colored card (red, yellow, green, violet).  
     - On first turn, any color may be chosen.  
     - On subsequent turns, must play same color as first card.  
     - May optionally play one white or special card with the colored card.  
     - Cards are played face-up in front of the player, overlapping to show all symbols.  
     - Special cards return to hand when withdrawing; others are discarded.

   - **Withdrawing**:  
     - Player compares their played cards to all remaining (non-withdrawn) players.  
     - For each symbol where they have the **strict majority** (more than any other single player), and the corresponding token is still available, they claim it:  
       - **Vizier, General, Monk, Princess**: Take the oval influence tile.  
       - **Grand Mogul**: Take the crown.  
       - **Elephant**: Take the province tile.  
     - Resolve effects immediately:  
       - **Advisor tile**: Place a palace on any empty city in the current province. If on a fortress, take the bonus tile.  
       - **Crown**: Place a "crown palace" on any city (even occupied). Do **not** take bonus tile if placed on a fortress.  
       - **Province tile**: Keep for endgame scoring.  
     - Score points (see Scoring).  
     - Discard all played normal cards. Keep special cards.  
     - Take 2 cards from the face-up supply (last player takes only 1).  
     - If withdrawing with no cards played, draw 1 card from the deck **before** taking supply cards.

3. **End of Visit**  
   - All players who have **two identical influence tiles** return them and take the corresponding special card (from board or player).  
   - Return the crown to the Court (leave palace on board).  
   - Move starting player marker clockwise.  
   - Proceed to next visit.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Color Lock**: Once a player plays a colored card, all future cards in that visit must match that color.  
- **Majority Wins**: Only strict majority (no ties) wins influence. Withdrawn players’ cards are ignored.  
- **Card Supply**: 5/7/9 face-up cards depending on player count. Refilled each visit.  
- **Palace Placement**:  
  - Normal palaces only on empty cities.  
  - Crown palace may be placed on any city.  
  - Multiple palaces can occupy a city (but only one normal per player).  
- **Special Cards**:  
  - Played with a colored card.  
  - Return to hand after use.  
  - Effects:  
    - +1 Elephant / +1 Grand Mogul: Add one symbol.  
    - +2 Points: Score immediately when played.  
    - Free Color Change: Break color lock for that turn only.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### During Withdrawal:
- **Bonus Tiles**:  
  - **+4 / +2**: Score immediately, discard tile.  
  - **Draw Card**: Take top card from deck, discard tile.  
  - **Commodity (Rice, Tea, Spice, Gems)**: Score 1 point + 1 point for each matching commodity already owned (including this one). Keep tile.  
- **Province Tile**:  
  - Score 1 point per commodity on tile + 1 point for each matching commodity already owned.  
- **Palaces**:  
  - **+1 point** for placing at least one palace.  
  - **+1 point** for each **province** (not city) connected via uninterrupted chain of your palaces.  
    - Chain must follow roads.  
    - Broken by empty cities or opponent’s palaces.  
    - Crown palace counts as your palace for connection.

#### End of Game (After 12th Visit):
Each player scores:  
- **1 point** per white card (normal or special) in hand.  
- **1 point** per card in the **one color** they have the most of (if tie, choose one).  
- **No points** for leftover colored cards not in majority color.

**Winner**: Highest total score.  
**Tiebreaker**: Most cards in hand.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Uncontested Majority**: If all others withdraw, last player wins all available majorities they hold (even if only one symbol).  
- **Ties**: No player wins the tied symbol. Token remains in Court.  
- **No Winner for Province Tile**: If no one has majority in Elephant, remove tile from game.  
- **Multiple Bonuses**: Score sequentially; each bonus may trigger scoring for previous ones.  
- **Special Card Already Held**: If a player already has a special card, they still return two matching influence tiles at end of visit.  
- **Palace Limit**: Unlimited; use substitute markers if needed.  
- **2-Player Variant**:  
  - After each turn, draw 1 card to "Unrest" pile.  
  - If unrest card matches color of another in unrest (not white), discard it and trigger **Protest**:  
    - If any symbol appears most in unrest (strict majority), remove that token from Court.  
    - Discard all unrest cards. Only one protest per visit.  
  - At visit end, unclaimed province tile is removed; other tokens returned.
