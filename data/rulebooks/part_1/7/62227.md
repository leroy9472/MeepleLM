# Labyrinth: The War on Terror

## 1. Lore & Objective
Labyrinth simulates the strategic struggle between the United States and Islamist extremists from 2001 onward. The US aims to promote good governance in Muslim countries to eliminate extremism. The Jihadist player seeks to establish Islamist rule across the Muslim world or inflict such damage on the US that it withdraws from the region.

**Victory Conditions:**

- **US Wins instantly if:**
  - Muslim countries with a total of **12 Resources** have **Good Governance**
  - At least **15 Muslim countries** (of 18) have **Fair or Good Governance**
  - There are **no Jihadist cells** on the map

- **Jihadist Wins instantly if:**
  - Countries with **6 or more Resources** are under **Islamist Rule**, including **at least two adjacent countries**
  - **US Prestige is 1** and **15 Muslim countries** have **Poor or Islamist Rule Governance**
  - A **WMD Plot is resolved in the US** without being countered

- **End of Game (Reshuffle):**
  - If no instant victory, the US wins if more than twice as many Resources are under Good Governance as under Islamist Rule (counting green Regime Change markers as Islamist Rule for this calculation). Otherwise, the Jihadist wins.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Card Play
- Cards can be used for **Operations (Ops)** or **Events**
- Playing an opponent's event card **triggers their event**
- Exception: The **first Plot operation each turn** by the Jihadist **does not trigger** a US event
- **Reserves:** Play 1- or 2-value cards to store value (max 2). Can be spent later to boost an Ops card to value 3 (except Reassessment)

### US Operations
Must target one country per card. Ops value must meet or exceed country's Governance requirement:
- Good: 1+
- Fair: 2+
- Poor: 3 only
- Islamist Rule: Only Regime Change (3-value card)

**Operations:**
- **War of Ideas (WoI):**
  - In Muslim country: Improve Neutral → Ally or Ally Governance (Poor→Fair→Good). Roll 5+ (modified). If fails by 1, place first Aid marker.
  - In non-Muslim country: Roll Posture (1–4 Soft, 5–6 Hard). If matches US Posture, Prestige +1.
- **Deploy:**
  - Move troops from one location to another (including Troops Track).
  - Destination must be Ally (Muslim) or Regime Change country.
  - **Regime Change:** Hard Posture, 3-value card, deploy ≥6 troops to Islamist Rule country. Roll Governance, Alignment → Ally, Sleeper cells → Active, Roll Prestige.
  - **Withdraw:** Soft Posture, 3-value card, remove troops from Regime Change country. Remove Aid, place Besieged Regime, Roll Prestige.
- **Disrupt:**
  - Target must be Ally, have ≥2 troops, or be non-Muslim.
  - With ≥2 troops or Hard Posture: affect 2 cells; else 1.
  - Remove Active cells, activate Sleeper cells, or remove cadre.
  - If last cell removed, place cadre.
  - If ≥2 troops present, Prestige +1.
- **Alert:**
  - 3-value card required.
  - Reveal and remove 1 Plot. WMD Plots are permanently removed.
- **Reassessment:**
  - Play two 3-value cards (no Reserves).
  - Change US Posture (Hard ↔ Soft).

### Jihadist Operations
Can target multiple countries. Card value = number of dice rolled. Governance determines success range:
- Good: 1
- Fair: 1–2
- Poor: 1–3
- Islamist Rule: automatic

**Operations:**
- **Recruit:** Place Sleeper cell in country with cell or cadre. Remove cadre if present. Automatic success in Regime Change countries.
- **Travel:** Move cell between countries. Adjacent travel automatic. Non-adjacent: roll ≤ Governance. Success → Sleeper; failure → removed.
- **Jihad:**
  - Target Muslim countries (not Iran) not under Islamist Rule.
  - Minor Jihad: Each success worsens Governance by 1 level, removes 1 Aid.
  - Major Jihad: Requires cells > troops by 5+ and activate all Sleepers. Two successes on one card shift Poor → Islamist Rule.
  - Failed roll removes cell.
  - If 3 dice rolled for Major Jihad in Poor country and fails, place Besieged Regime, shift Alignment toward Ally.
  - Becoming Islamist Rule: Alignment → Adversary, Funding + country's Resources, Prestige → 1 if troops present, activate Pakistan WMD.
- **Plot:**
  - Target any country not under Islamist Rule.
  - 1 cell per die roll (must be Active after).
  - Each success places a Plot marker (value ≤ card value) or WMD, face down.
  - Plots resolved at end of US Action Phase.

### Resolving Plots
At end of each US Action Phase, resolve all unblocked Plots in any order:
- **Funding:**
  - Muslim or Iran, Fair/Poor: +1; Good: +2
  - Non-WMD, non-Muslim: +Plot#; if Good: +2×Plot#
  - WMD in non-Muslim, or any Plot in US: Funding → 9
- **Posture:**
  - Non-Muslim: roll Posture. WMD: Jihadist may reroll. Schengen: roll 2 other Schengen countries.
- **Prestige:**
  - If troops present: -1; if WMD: →1. If in US: roll Prestige.
- **Governance/Aid:**
  - Muslim: roll dice = Plot# (3 if WMD) as Jihad attempt. Each success removes 1 Aid, worsens Governance (not to Islamist Rule).

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Instant Win:** Achieve any victory condition during play.
- **End of Game:** When deck is exhausted for agreed reshuffle count:
  - US wins if Good Governance Resources > 2 × Islamist Rule Resources (including green Regime Change as Islamist Rule)
  - Otherwise, Jihadist wins.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Testing:** Only test unmarked countries. Once marked, ignore future "Test" instructions.
- **US Troops Track:** Not part of the US for game effects (e.g., Disrupt in US ≠ +1 Prestige).
- **Plot Shuffling:** Jihadist may shuffle Plots in a country to hide values.
- **Besieged Regime:** Can exist in Islamist Rule countries.
- **Oil Price Spike:** Bring a card from discard pile into hand. Oil countries' Resources +1 per active Oil Price Spike.
- **FATWA (Solitaire):** Follow specific solitaire steps including additional 1OP play.
- **Event Refusal:** Cannot refuse opponent's event when triggered.
- **Cadre Removal:** Jihadist may remove cadres during any Jihadist Action Phase.
