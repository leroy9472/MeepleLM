   - 2 players: Use 2 Quests, each beneath two color dots.

   - 4 Gold
   - 1 Column of each color (R/Y/G/B)
   - VP equal to their Disc number (1–4)
   - Order of Play disc (1 to start, others clockwise)
6. Choose 5 of 8 Families; return others to box. Shuffle selected cards into draw pile.
7. Deal (3 × player count + 1) cards face-up to form the Agora.

   - Place Oracle board above Pediment.
   - Deal 4 cards face-up to Oracle.
9. Place Level Bonus (3) and Family Bonus (10) tiles matching chosen Families beside play area.
10. If Ares is in play, place Prestige Points in common supply.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of 5 Epochs consists of 4 phases:

### Phase I: Awakening (Skip in Epoch 1)
1. Discard remaining Agora cards to discard pile.
2. If Apollo is in play, move Oracle cards to Agora.
3. Refill Agora to (3 × players + 1) cards from draw pile.
4. If Apollo is in play, refill Oracle with 4 new cards.
5. If draw pile is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.

### Phase II: Actions
- Players take 4 turns each, in disc order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1...).
- On each turn, take either:
  - 1 Quest tile, or
  - 1 Family card from Agora.
- Must end phase with exactly:
  - 3 Family cards
  - 1 Quest tile
- To take a card or Quest:
  - Must meet Acquisition Condition (matching Column(s)).
  - Black circle = any color Column.
  - For Quests (2-player): need one of two colors above tile.
- After taking card/Quest:
  - Place in Domain (for cards) or beside board (for Quests).
  - Dismiss exactly 1 Column (any color, not necessarily used).
- If unable to take Family card:
  - Take top card from draw pile, place face-down in Domain = Citizen.
  - Cannot take Citizen if able to take Family card or still need Quest.
- If unable to take Quest:
  - Pass turn after taking 3 Family cards.
  - After all players finish, take remaining Quest and flip to incomplete side.

#### Card Powers in Phase II
- **Instantaneous (lightning)**: Use immediately upon taking card.
- **Permanent (infinity)**: Always active while in Domain.
- **Activate (arrow)**: Use once per Epoch; tap card (turn sideways); untaps at end of Epoch.
- **Trigger (circle)**: Use once per game; place Trigger ring when acquired; return ring when used.
- **Eleusis (snake)**: Activate only if at least one other Eleusis card in Domain.
- Powers may be used in any order during your turn; multiple powers allowed.
- Cannot use powers during other players’ turns.
- Athena card effects (e.g., allow transfers): current player transfers first, then others in turn order.

### Phase III: Writing the Legends
1. **Reallocate Order Discs**:
   - Discs assigned by Quest number taken (1 → Disc 1, etc.).
   - Incomplete Quest → highest-numbered Disc.
   - Tiebreaker: earlier current disc keeps earlier position.
2. **Receive Benefits**:
   - All players gain VP and Gold shown on their Quest.
3. **Transfer Cards**:
   - In new turn order, each player may transfer cards from Domain to Elysium.
   - Max transfers = Lyre symbol on Quest.
   - Each transfer costs Gold = Level of card (1, 2, or 3).
   - Cannot use Gold gained from transfer to pay for that transfer.
   - After transfer, return Quest tile to Pediment in order.

#### Rules of Legends
- Every transferred card must:
  - Start a new Legend, or
  - Add to an existing Legend.
- Two Legend types:
  - **Family Legend**: 2–3 cards, same Family, different Levels.
  - **Level Legend**: 2–5 cards, same Level, different Families.
- Cards may be added in any order.
- Multiple incomplete Legends allowed.
- Once in Legend, card cannot be moved or discarded.
- Single cards in Elysium at game end are removed and worth 0 VP.
- If transferring card with Trigger ring, return ring to supply.
- Tapped cards may be transferred.

#### Citizens
- May be transferred only to Legends with at least 2 cards.
- Acts as wildcard, replacing missing card.
- Transfer cost = Level of card being replaced.
- Player does not declare which Family/Level it represents.
- Does not become part of replaced Family (important for Chronos cards).
- Each Citizen in Elysium at end of game costs 2 VP.
- Can be discarded from Domain for card powers requiring discarding a card.

#### Legend Bonuses
- **Family Legend**:
  - 1st to complete: 5 VP Bonus tile.
  - 2nd to complete: 2 VP Bonus tile.
  - Same player may earn both by completing two Legends of same Family.
- **Level Legend**:
  - 1st to have at least 2 cards: gains Level Bonus tile (Level 1 = 3 VP, Level 2 = 6 VP, Level 3 = 9 VP).
  - If another player has more cards in same-Level Legend, they steal the tile.
  - Tile cannot be stolen once a player has 5-card Legend of that Level.

### Phase IV: End of Epoch
1. Return all 4 Columns to player boards.
2. Untap all Activate cards in Domain.
3. Advance Epoch marker one space.
4. Begin next Epoch with Phase I.

## 5. Core Mechanics

   - Scores all different Families (up to 5, excluding Citizens).
   - VP not physically taken; just recorded.
5. Score Legends:

     - 3 cards = 4 VP
     - 4 cards = 8 VP

6. Score Prestige Points (if Ares in play):
   - Most PP: 16 VP
   - Second: 8 VP
   - Third: 4 VP
   - Fourth: 2 VP
   - Ties: Split cumulative VP of tied ranks.
   - 0 PP = 0 bonus VP.
