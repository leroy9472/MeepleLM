## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Star Trek: Ascendancy*, players represent major galactic civilizations—such as the Federation, Klingons, and Romulans—expanding their influence across uncharted space. The goal is to achieve galactic dominance by developing systems, researching advancements, and asserting control through colonization, invasion, or cultural hegemony. Victory is achieved by either:
- Reaching Ascendancy Level 5 and controlling your home system, or
- Controlling three home systems (including your own).

### 2. Components
- Home System discs (one per player)
- System discs (planetary systems, phenomena, civilizations)
- Space lane connectors and dice
- Control Nodes, Production Nodes, Research Nodes, Culture Nodes
- Starbase tokens
- Ship and Fleet markers
- Command, Production, Research, and Culture tokens
- Advancement decks (Federation, Klingon, Romulan)
- Project cards and Advancement cards
- Warp Tokens
- Exploration Cards (Crisis, Discovery, Virgin, Civilization)
- Borg components (optional): Borg Cubes, Spire tokens, Borg Command Console

### 3. Setup
1. Place each player’s Home System 18" apart and at least 5" from the table edge.
2. Each player begins with:
   - Home System fully developed (1 Control Node, 1 Production Node, 1 Research Node, 1 Culture Node)
   - 3 Ships in Home System
   - 5 Command Tokens (1 exhausted)
   - 3 Production, 3 Research, 3 Culture tokens
   - 1 random Advancement card
   - Ascendancy Level 1
3. Shuffle and stack System discs:
   - Remove 2 System discs per player and set aside.
   - Shuffle remaining systems (including phenomena) and place the set-aside discs on top.
4. Shuffle each faction’s Advancement deck separately.
5. (Optional – Delta Quadrant) Place Transwarp Hub centrally; include Borg decks and components.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game round consists of three stages:

#### STAGE 1: Initiative Stage
- Players who have made First Contact bid resources (Production, Research, or Culture) to determine turn order.
- No two players may bid the same amount.
- Highest bidder chooses first from Turn Order Cards; others select in descending bid order.
- Players without First Contact receive random turn order.

#### STAGE 2: Execution Stage
Players take turns in initiative order, completing both phases:

**Building Phase:**
- Build Ships (1 Production each) at Home System or Starbase.
- Form Fleets (3+ Ships) without Command cost if built together.
- Colonize Systems: Spend 1 Ship + 1 Culture to place Control Node on undeveloped system.
- Place Nodes:
  - Production Node: 2 Production (requires red/wild capacity)
  - Research Node: 2 Research + 1 Production (requires blue/wild capacity)
  - Culture Node: 2 Culture + 1 Production (requires yellow/wild capacity)
- Commit 1 Research token per active Project.
- Upgrade Weapons/Shields using Research tokens (cost shown on Command Console).

**Command Phase:**
- Spend Command Tokens (1 per action) to:
  - **Move:** Impulse (2 sectors) or Warp (place Warp Token; add more with Commands; exit using total Warp Tokens).
  - **Discover Systems:** Move beyond unconnected space lane end; draw Exploration Card.
  - **Brave Hazards:** Roll per ship in hazardous systems; survive to claim Research Token.
  - **Initiate Space Battle:** Attack adjacent or same-sector rival ships.
  - **Invade Planet:** Attack developed system you occupy.
  - **Attempt Cultural Hegemony:** Exhaust Command + 1 Culture; roll d6 + Ascendancy vs. Hegemony Resistance.
  - **Commission Starbase:** Place in controlled system (max = Ascendancy Level).
  - **Form Fleet:** Exhaust Command to group ≥3 ships at Home System or Starbase.
  - **Launch Project:** Draw 2 Advancement cards; add to Projects (max = # Research Nodes).
  - **Use Special Rules:** Exhaust Advancement or Command as specified.

#### STAGE 3: Recharge Stage
1. Check for victory.
2. Generate Resources:
   - 1 each per Node type
   - Trade Agreements yield shown resources
   - Some Advancements grant bonuses
3. Refresh all exhausted cards, tokens, and Trade Agreements.
4. Add 1 Warp Token to each ship at warp.
5. Resupply Phenomena with Research Tokens (if empty).

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Movement
- **Impulse:** Move up to 2 sectors via space lanes.
- **Warp:** Exhaust Command to enter warp (place Warp Token); add more with Commands. Exit by moving up to (Warp Tokens + Warp icons from Advancements) systems.
- Cannot move through uncontrolled hostile sectors without permission.
- Warp movement ends upon discovery or hazard.

#### Combat
**Space Battles:**
- Initiated by attacker; exhaust 1 Command.
- Roll 1 die per ship. To hit: roll ≥ (your Weapons + enemy Shields).
- Simultaneous rolls unless First Strike applies (attacker hits before defender rolls; first round only).
- Starbase adds +1 die (does not fight alone).
- Attacker chooses casualty ships.
- After casualties, attacker decides to retreat/continue; then defender.
- Retreat at impulse speed through existing lanes.
- Winner may move surviving ships at impulse speed to one sector.

**Planetary Invasions:**
- Must occupy system with rival structures.
- Attacker rolls per ship; defender rolls per node (Control, Production, Research, Culture).
- Starbases do not participate.
- Results:
  - **More hits than nodes:** Success — place Control Node.
  - **Fewer hits:** Collateral Damage — attacker destroys one node per hit (Control last).
  - **Equal hits:** Total Annihilation — all nodes destroyed; system must be recolonized.
- Capturing Research Node: defender gives one active Project to attacker.
- Capturing Starbase: attacker gains one Command Token (exhausted).

**Cultural Hegemony:**
- Exhaust Command + 1 Culture to attempt.
- Roll d6 + your Ascendancy.
- Must exceed Hegemony Resistance:
  - For players: (# Nodes + Starbase + their Ascendancy)
  - For warp-capable civilizations: (# Nodes + Warp Tokens)
- Success: spend 1 Culture to take control (place Control Node).
- No effect on pre-warp civilizations (must colonize).

#### Advancements
- Research Projects require tokens equal to cost (top-left number).
- Max Projects = number of Research Nodes.
- Complete by reaching required tokens; move to Advancement area.
- Effects vary by type (Military, Exploration, Espionage, etc.).
- Some grant Warp, Command, or Culture Tokens upon completion.
- Exhausted cards (flipped face down) cannot be used; refresh during Recharge Stage.

#### Trade Agreements
- Exchange when adjacent or in same sector as rival.
- Grants "At Peace" status; allows request to pass through rival-controlled space.
- During Recharge, gain pictured resources.
- Breaking peace (attack) returns Trade Cards.
- Max one agreement per rival.

#### Hazards & Phenomena
- Hazardous systems require die roll per ship ending movement there.
- Roll ≥ (Hazard Level – Ship Shields) to survive.
- Survivors claim Research Token (from supply or on phenomenon).
- Phenomena do not draw Exploration Cards.

#### Borg (Optional Rules)
- Automated opponent using Build and Command phases.
- Builds Nodes, Cubes, and assimilates systems.
- Transwarp Hub enables faster expansion.
- Victory: defeat all players if 6 Spires are built.
- Players win by achieving standard victory while resisting Borg.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Ascendancy increases by controlling systems with all three node types.
- Victory conditions:
  - Reach Ascendancy Level 5 **and** control your home system.
  - Control three home systems (including your own).
- Game ends immediately when a player meets either condition.
- Borg win if they build a 6th Spire.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I move through my own controlled systems with enemy ships?** Yes.
- **Can Fleets split?** No; disband and reform if needed.
- **Do exhausted Trade Agreements generate resources?** No; only active (unexhausted) ones.
- **Can you hegemonize a pre-warp system?** No; must colonize during Building Phase.
- **Can multiple players attack the same Borg Cube?** No; only the activating player may attack.
- **Do Advancements that affect "Rivals" work on the Borg?** Yes, unless specified otherwise.
- **Can you use Advancements from other factions?** Only your own Advancements are usable.
- **What happens to Warp Tokens when conquering a warp-capable system?** Discard them.
