### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game consists of **3 rounds**.  
Each round proceeds as follows:  
1. All players simultaneously choose **1 card** from their hand to keep, placing it face-down in front of them.  
2. All players reveal their chosen cards at the same time (call “Sushi… Go!”).  
3. Each player passes their **remaining hand** to the player on their **left**.  
4. Repeat steps 1–3 until all cards are played (i.e., players have no cards left in hand).  
5. Score all collected cards (except pudding).  
6. Discard all non-pudding cards.  
7. Begin next round by dealing a new hand of the same size as the first round.  

**Passing Direction Variant (Optional):**  
- Round 1: Pass left

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Scoring (per round unless noted)  
- **Nigiri:**  
  - Squid: 3 points  
  - Salmon: 2 points  
  - Egg: 1 point  
- **Wasabi:**  
  - If played, the **next nigiri** you play must be placed **on top** of it.  
  - That nigiri is worth **triple points**.  
  - Wasabi with no nigiri scores 0.  
  - Multiple wasabi cards can be played, but each can only hold one nigiri.  

- **Tempura:**  
  - Each **set of 2** tempura cards = 5 points.  
  - Unpaired tempura = 0 points.  
  - Multiple sets allowed (e.g., 4 tempura = 10 points).  

- **Sashimi:**  
  - Each **set of 3** sashimi cards = 10 points.  
  - Fewer than 3 = 0 points.  
  - Multiple sets allowed (e.g., 6 sashimi = 20 points).  

- **Dumplings:**  
  - Score based on total count:  
    - 1 dumpling = 1 point  
    - 2 = 3 points  
    - 3 = 6 points  
    - 4 = 10 points  
    - 5 or more = 15 points  

- **Maki Rolls:**  
  - Score based on **number of maki roll icons** (not number of cards).  
  - At end of round:  
    - Most maki: 6 points  
    - Second most: 3 points  
  - Ties:  
    - If tied for **first**, split 6 points (round down), no second-place points awarded.  
    - If tied for **second**, split 3 points (round down).  
  - You must have **at least one maki card** to score.  

- **Chopsticks:**  
  - Worth 0 points.  
  - On a future turn, you may use it to play **2 cards** instead of 1.  
  - To use:  
    1. Have chopsticks already in front of you.  
    2. On your turn, place **first card** face-down.  
    3. Before reveal, call “Sushi Go!” and place **second card** face-down.  
    4. Reveal both cards simultaneously.  
    5. Return chopsticks to your hand before passing.  
  - Only **one chopsticks** may be used per turn, even if you have multiple.  

- **Pudding:**  
  - Not scored during rounds.  
  - Kept in front of you across all 3 rounds.  
  - Scored **only at the end of the game**:  
    - Most pudding: +6 points  
    - Least pudding: –6 points  
    - Ties: split points (ignore remainder)  
    - If all players have same number: no one scores  
  - **In 2-player games:** Only most pudding scores +6; least does **not** lose points.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- After each round, score applicable cards (except pudding), then discard them.  
- After 3 rounds:  
  1. Total all round scores.  
  2. Add final pudding score.  
- **Winner:** Player with highest total score.  
- **Tiebreaker:** Most pudding cards.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I save Wasabi for later?**  
  Yes, but the **next** nigiri you play must go on it. You cannot skip.  
- **Can I use Chopsticks on the same turn I play them?**  
  No. Chopsticks must already be in front of you from a previous turn.  
- **Can I play two Chopsticks in one turn?**  
  No. Only one chopsticks effect per turn, even if you have multiple.  
- **What if I have Wasabi but no Nigiri?**  
  The wasabi scores 0.  
- **Can I use Chopsticks to take a Wasabi or Pudding?**  
  Yes. All cards are valid targets.  
- **What if two players tie for second in Maki?**  
  They split 3 points (e.g., 1 point each).  
- **Do I have to use Chopsticks if I have them?**  
  No. Use is optional.
