## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
ATLANTIS RISING is a cooperative game where players portray the leading citizens of Atlantis, working together to save their civilization from destruction. The island is threatened by earthquakes, floods, and divine wrath. Players must gather resources, manage flooding, and construct a Cosmic Gate to transport the population to safety.

**Objective:**  
Successfully build all components in the Blueprint, including the Power Core, before all 37 island tiles are flooded. If the Power Core is built, all players win. If the center tile floods or no tiles remain to flood when required, all players lose.
