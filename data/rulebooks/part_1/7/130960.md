### 1. Lore & Objective
Triumph & Tragedy is a strategy game set between 1936 and 1945, simulating the geopolitical struggle among three Factions: the Axis (fascist), the West (capitalist), and the USSR (communist). Players compete through economic development, military conquest, technological advancement, and diplomacy. Victory can be achieved in four ways: Economic, Military, Atomic, or Hegemony Victory.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
#### New Year Phase
1. **Advance Year**
2. **Victory Check**: If any Faction has ≥25 VPs → Economic Victory
3. **Reshuffle** Action and Investment decks
4. **Peace Dividends**: Deal 1 face-down chit to each Faction at peace (not in battle/VoN last year)
5. **Turn Order**: Roll 1d6; consult faction tracks for order

#### Production Phase (in Turn Order)
1. **Blockade Check** (Factions at War only): Adjust POP/RES if Trade Routes are blocked
2. **Determine Production Level** = min(IND, POP, RES)
   - At Peace: ignore RES
   - Great Power without MainCapital → Production = 0
3. **Spend Production** (1 Production = 1 unit step or 1 card)
   - Build/upgrade units
   - Buy Action or Investment cards
4. Remove all Blockade markers

#### Government Phase (in Turn Order)
Players take turns playing cards or passing. Ends after 3 consecutive passes.
Options:
- **Diplomacy**: 1 Action Card → gain Influence on Neutral
- **Industry**: Investment Cards with total Factory Value ≥ current Factory Cost → +1 IND (max 2/year)
- **Technology**: 2 Investment Cards with same Tech → Achieve Tech (reveal or place in Secret Vault)
- **Intelligence**: 1 Investment Card with Intel function → immediate effect
- **Pass**

After cardplay:
- Resolve Diplomacy: apply Influence/Control
- Adjust POP/RES
- Discard to HandSize Limit (each Secret Tech reduces limit by 1)

#### Seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall)
1. **Command Phase**: Players commit 1 Command card face-down or pass
   - After 3 passes, reveal cards
   - Command Order = alphabetical by card letter
2. **Player Turns** (in Command Order):
   - **Movement Phase**: Move up to Command Value units
   - **Combat Phase**: Resolve Active Battles
3. **Supply Phase** (Factions at War only):
   - Units without Supply Line lose 1 CV (Fortresses exempt)
   - Summer only: Blockade Phase → mark untraceable POP/RES

#### Winter (USSR only)
Same as above, but movement/combat limited to USSR territory.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Diplomacy & Neutral Status
- **Unaligned Neutral**: 0 Influence → no POP/RES access
- **Associate**: 1 Influence → grants POP/RES to influencing Faction
- **Protectorate**: 2 Influence → same as Associate; attack requires DoW on Protector
- **Satellite**: 3+ Influence → full control; units placed per Muster Value; territory becomes Friendly
- **Repudiation**: Remove own Influence at any time
- **Violation of Neutrality (VoN)**: Enter Neutral Territory → triggers Armed Minor deployment, removes Influence, rivals draw 1–3 Action Cards based on Capital Muster Value

#### Declaration of War (DoW)
- Required before entering Rival Territory or Protectorate
- Declarer flips "Peace With" to "DoW", Victim removes marker (revealing -1 Factory Cost)
- Factions become Enemies and at War
- Declarer gains Surprise: FirstFire for that Combat Phase

#### Unit Types & Movement
- **Ground Units (G)**: Infantry, Tanks, Fortresses
- **Air Units (A)**: Air Forces
- **Naval Units (N)**: Fleets, Carriers
- **Submarines (S)**: Subs
- **Convoys**: Ground Units at Sea (no combat action)

Movement Rules:
- **Land Movement**: Start in Land Area; stop on Enemy units (except AFs/Subs)
- **Sea Movement**: Start in Sea/Coastal Area; stop on Enemy units (except Subs)
- **Air Movement**: Can pass through Enemy Areas; start in Sea → must end in Friendly Land
- **Strategic Movement**: Double range if moving only through Friendly Territory and not Engaging/Disengaging
- **Disengaging**: Move out of Battle into adjacent Friendly Area (cannot re-engage)

#### Combat
- **Combat Phase**: Active Player designates Active Battles
- **Combat Rounds**:
  - Units act by Class order (Fortress → AF → Fleet → Carrier → Sub → Infantry → Tank → Convoy)
  - Within class: Defender acts before Attacker (unless FirstFire)
- **Actions**: Fire, Retreat, ReBase (ANS only)
- **Retreat Rules**:
  - Cannot retreat to Enemy/Rival/Neutral areas
  - Attackers must retreat to entry area if they entered that turn
  - Ground units cannot retreat to Sea unless Friendly-occupied
  - AFs must ReBase to retreat
- **ReBase**: Free move during Combat/Supply Phase for ANS to undisputed Friendly Land Area

#### Special Combat Rules
- **Invasion Battles**: Max 1 GU per Coastal border (2 with LST Tech); invading units take no Combat Action first turn
- **Strategic Bombing**: Requires Precision Bombsight; AF over Enemy MainCapital attacks IND at I1
- **Raids**: ANS aggression without Ground Support; does not block retreats; Raiders must retreat at round end
- **Sea Battles**: Continue until one side remains; AFs must ReBase after each round; Subs may Escape
- **BattleGroups**: Only one per Combat Round joins a Sea Battle
- **Carrier Strike**: Fire N1 and immediately ReBase/Retreat

#### Supply & Blockade
- **Supply Line**: Chain from GU to Friendly MainCapital/SubCapital through Friendly/Open Sea areas
- **Unsupplied GUs**: Lose 1 CV in Supply Phase
- **Trade Route**: Chain from POP/RES to MainCapital (max 1 Land + 1 Sea segment); blocked by Enemy units or Escaped Subs
- **Blockade**: Mark POP/RES without Trade Route; reduces Production
- **Med Blockade**: Black RES cannot route around Africa; if forced, cannot count for Production

#### Technology
- **Achieving Tech**: Play 2 matching Investment Cards
- **Secret Vault**: Place Tech-pair face-down; reduces HandSize by 1; reveal at any time
- **FirstFire**: Units fire before enemies of same type without it
- **Atomic Research**: 4 levels in order; each grants +1 VP; 4th level enables Atomic Victory

#### USA Mechanics
- **West Influence**: 1–2 → access to USA POP/RES; 3+ → becomes West Satellite
- **USA Public Opinion**: West gains 1 Influence in 1941–1944 unless already Satellite
- **VoN by Axis**: USA immediately becomes West Satellite; place 1942 units; 1943/1944 units arrive in next productions
- **USA as West Satellite**: Factory Cost -1; USA Fortresses in Washington (4 CV) and New York (2 CV); USA units arrive in 1942–1944 at 1/2/3 CV per type

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### Victory Conditions
- **Economic Victory**: ≥25 VPs at start of New Year
- **Military Victory**: Control 2 Enemy MainCapitals/SubCapitals simultaneously
- **Atomic Victory**: Reveal 4th Atomic Research level and have AF within range of Enemy MainCapital
- **Hegemony Victory**: Most VPs at end of 1945 (calculate as 1946, ignoring blockades)

#### Victory Points (VPs)
- Production Level (incl. blockades)
- +1 VP per Atomic Research level
- +2 VPs per Enemy MainCapital/SubCapital controlled
- + Peace Dividend values
- -1 VP per DoW issued

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Three-Faction Battles**: At start of Combat, specify which enemy to target; units from targeted faction can participate
- **Escaped Subs**: Face-down in Sea Area; block Trade Routes; can be re-engaged optionally
- **Fortresses**: Immobil, exempt from Supply, max 1 per Land Area
- **HandSize Compliance**: After Government Phase, discard excess; Secret Techs count against limit
- **Emergency Command**: Wrong-season card = value 2 (4 for Axis); can move in Friendly areas only; no Combat
- **Unit Creation**: Must be in Home Territory (except Fortresses); cannot create in Battle or OOS
- **Satellite Units**: Placed when nation becomes Satellite; use Controller’s Great Power units
