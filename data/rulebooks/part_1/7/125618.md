## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players are pirate crew members seeking to amass the greatest fortune over three campaigns (weeks) of looting. The goal is to accumulate the most doubloons by collecting and converting booty, managing crew abilities, and strategically timing plays. The richest player at the end of the third campaign wins and is said to bring the mythical pirate utopia, Libertalia, to life.

2. Components  
- 1 game board with 6 daily loot spaces under a ship  
- 6 pirate dens (player mats)  
- 6 score tokens  
- 6 crew marker cards (color-coded)  
- 180 character cards (30 per player, one deck per color)  
- 1 score track  
- 50 booty tokens:  
  - 4 Chests (5 doubloons each)  
  - 6 Jewels (3 doubloons each)  
  - 10 Goods (1 doubloon each)  
  - 6 Spanish Officers (triggers character discard)  
  - 6 Sabers (allows discard of adjacent player’s character)  
  - 8 Treasure Maps (3 maps = 12 doubloons)  
  - 10 Cursed Relics (−3 doubloons each at rest)  
- 118 doubloons:  
  - 13 × 10-value  
  - 15 × 5-value  
  - 45 × 1-value  
- Bag or cup for random draw of booty tokens  

3. Setup  
- Randomly assign player colors by drawing crew marker cards face-down.  
- Each player takes:  
  - Their color-den, score token, crew marker, and 30-card deck  
  - Place score token at 0 on the score track  
  - Take 10 doubloons (1 × 5, 5 × 1)  
- Place all booty tokens in a bag and shuffle.  
- Draw 6 × number of players booty tiles (e.g., 24 for 4 players) and distribute evenly across the 6 daily spaces (4 tiles per space in 4-player).  
- Youngest player shuffles their deck and draws 9 cards. Read ranks aloud.  
- All players select the same 9 ranks from their decks to form identical starting hands.  
- Place unused decks aside; place crew marker on top.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each campaign consists of 6 looting days and 1 rest day. Repeat for 3 campaigns.

**Looting Day Phases (Days 1–6):**  
1. **Sunrise**:  
   - Each player selects one character card and places it facedown.  
   - Reveal all cards.  
   - Sort by rank (top left, 1–30) from low to high.  
   - Break rank ties using Influence (silver banner number, high wins).  

2. **Day**:  
   - Resolve Day abilities in order from lowest to highest rank.  
   - Abilities are mandatory unless stated otherwise.  

3. **Dusk**:  
   - Resolve in order from highest to lowest rank.  
   - Each player takes one booty tile from the current day’s space.  
   - Immediately resolve effects if the tile is:  
     - **Spanish Officer**: Discard the character just played (do not add to den). Place Spanish Officer face-down in den.  
     - **Saber**: Choose a character from a player adjacent to you (left or right) and discard it. If neither adjacent player has characters in their den, nothing happens. Place Saber face-down in your den.  
   - Otherwise, place booty face-down in den and move played character to den face-up.  
   - Remaining booty stays on board until the end of the campaign.  

4. **Night**:  
   - All characters currently in players’ dens resolve Night abilities.  
   - Order: highest to lowest rank (using Influence to break ties).  
   - Abilities repeat each night as long as the character remains in the den.  

**Rest Day (Day 7):**  
- Resolve Rest (End of Campaign) abilities for all characters in the den.  
- Calculate score:  
  - Doubloons in den  
  - + Chests (5 each), Jewels (3 each), Goods (1 each)  
  - + 12 doubloons per set of 3 Treasure Maps (incomplete sets = 0)  
  - − 3 doubloons per Cursed Relic  
  - Sabers and Spanish Officers are worth 0  
- Move score token on track by total.  
- Discard all characters in den and graveyard. Return all booty and doubloons to bank/bag.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Rank & Influence**:  
  - Rank (1–30, top left) determines turn order.  
  - Influence (silver banner, bottom left) breaks ties when ranks are equal.  
- **Hand Management**:  
  - Start with 9 identical cards.  
  - At end of campaign, keep unplayed cards (usually 3) and add 6 new shared cards.  
  - Some cards (e.g., Parrot, Recruiter, Surgeon) alter hand size.  
- **Special Actions by Phase**:  
  - **Day**: One-time, resolved at play (low to high rank).  
  - **Dusk**: One-time, resolved when taking booty (high to low).  
  - **Night**: Repeating, resolved every night while in den (high to low).  
  - **End of Campaign**: One-time, resolved only on Day 7 if character is in den.  
- **Doubloons**:  
  - If required to lose more than owned, reduce to 0 and continue.  
  - All mandatory actions proceed even if full cost can’t be paid.  
- **Tie-Breaking Variants (optional)**:  
  1. **Flags**: Use player flags in line; leftmost wins, winner moves to end.  
  2. **Tokens**: Assign 1–6 tokens; high number wins, winner trades with loser.  
  3. **The Hook**: Place Hook token on each day; player who takes it gains tie priority.  
  4. **D6**: Roll die for each tie.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Scoring occurs only on the Rest Day (Day 7) of each campaign.  
- Final score = sum of scores from all 3 campaigns.  
- Winner: player with highest total on score track after 3rd campaign.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Doubloons**: If loss exceeds holdings, reduce to 0 and resolve remainder of action.  
- **Parrot (1)**: Discard Parrot to immediately play another card in correct rank order. New card’s ability triggers.  
- **Cabin Boy (5)**: Does not take booty; remaining booty stays on board but is discarded at end of campaign.  
- **Waitress (8)**: Optional Night action: discard 1 treasure map to gain 3 doubloons.  
- **Voodoo Witch (11)**: Gain 2 doubloons per discarded character in graveyard. Graveyard empties after each campaign.  
- **Mutineer (13)**: Discard lowest-ranked character in den (not self). Gain 2 doubloons. Can target higher ranks. If alone, no effect.  
- **Brute (14)**: Discard highest-ranked character on ship. If Brute is highest, discard self.  
- **Topman (16)**: Gain 5 doubloons only if you have strictly the fewest characters in den. No gain on ties.  
- **Spanish Spy (17)**: Discard all Spanish Officers in den; draw one booty tile per discard. Drawn tiles have no effect.  
- **Cook (18)**: Take extra booty tile if available. If both Spanish Officer and Saber are taken, discard Cook.  
- **First Mate (28)**: Counts toward den character total for scoring (e.g., Quarter-master, Bosun).  
- **Graveyard**: All discarded characters go here. Removed from game at end of each campaign.  
- **Booty Discards**: Return immediately to bag.  
- **Hand Size Variants**: Parrot, Recruiter, and Surgeon can cause players to have different hand sizes.
