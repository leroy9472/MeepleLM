## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In the aftermath of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s death in 1791, his widow Constanze seeks the aid of his most generous patrons to complete his unfinished Requiem in D minor. Players take on the roles of these patrons, vying to influence the completion of the Requiem while recounting their personal memories and contributions to Mozart’s legacy. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by funding musical works, documenting memories, traveling across Europe, and supporting composers in finishing the Requiem. The player with the highest VP at the end of five game rounds wins.
