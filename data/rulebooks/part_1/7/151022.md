## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**
   - In the futuristic year 2045, baseball has evolved with Naturals (humans), Robots (hitters), and Cyborgs (bionic pitchers). The game simulates fast-paced 6-inning mini-games representing highlights of real baseball.
   - **Objective**: Win the most mini-games in a series (e.g., best-of-7 or best-of-11). Each mini-game is won by scoring more runs than the opponent.

2. **Components**
   - 4 Starting Team Decks (15 cards each): Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Boston
   - 60-card Free Agent Deck (FA-##)
   - 4 Stadium Mats (with Runs Scored and Games Won tracks)
   - 60 Wooden Pawns: Red (Fast), Blue (Average), White (Slow) Base Runners/Batters
   - 4 Home/Visitor Pennant Markers
   - Runs Scored and Games Won Markers

3. **Setup**
   - Each player:
     - Selects a 15-card Starting Team Deck and places it face down on the Lineup space of their Stadium Mat.
     - Draws 6 cards into hand.
     - May place one card face down on the On Deck circle, then draws a replacement card.
     - Places Runs Scored and Games Won markers on “0”.
     - Determines randomly who is Visiting (plays first) or Home Team; sets Pennant accordingly.
   - Shuffle the Free Agent Deck and reveal 6 cards face up as the Buy Row.
   - Place pawns within reach.

4. **Gameplay Flow**
   - A series consists of multiple mini-games.
   - Each mini-game has 6 rounds (“Innings”), where each player plays one card per turn.
   - Turn order:
     1. **Play Card**: Active player plays a card from hand to In Play Box.
        - Optionally, discard a card with PH icon to play On Deck card or top card of Lineup (Pinch Hitting).
     2. **Resolve Immediate Action**: If the card has a conditional Immediate Action, resolve it if conditions are met.
        - Offensive (green): affects own play.
        - Defensive (red): affects opponent.
     3. **Resolve Opponent’s Threatened Hits**: Resolve each uncancelled Hit Box from opponent’s last card:
        - Advance Base Runners (starting from highest base).
        - Move Batter to appropriate base (or score on Home Run).
     4. **Place Own Threatened Hits**: Place colored pawns (by speed icon) on Home Plate for each Hit Box on played card.
   - After both players play 6 cards:
     - **Visitor Save**: Visiting player may reveal On Deck card or top Lineup card to use a Defensive Immediate Action (red), then discard it.
     - Resolve any remaining Threatened Hits from Home Team’s last card.
   - **Scoring**: Team with more runs wins the mini-game. Ties trigger Extra Innings.

5. **Core Mechanics**
   - **Base Running**:
     - **Slow (White)**: Advances number of bases equal to hit.
     - **Average (Blue)**: Same as Slow, but scores from 2nd on a Single.
     - **Fast (Red)**: Advances one extra base beyond hit value.
     - Only one runner per base; runners cannot pass each other.
   - **Immediate Actions** (examples):
     - **Leadoff**: If first card played, execute hit immediately.
     - **Glove**: Cancel one opponent Threatened Hit.
     - **Curve**: Cancel all hits if opponent’s card is a Robot.
     - **Stolen Base**: Advance all Average/Fast runners one base.
     - **Quick Eye**: Execute hit if opponent’s top card is a Cyborg.
   - **Pinch Hitting**: Discard a PH-icon card to play On Deck card or top Lineup card.
   - **Visitor Save**: After Home Team’s last card, Visitor may use a Defensive Immediate Action from On Deck or top Lineup card.

6. **Scoring & End Game**
   - After mini-game:
     - Winning team advances Games Won marker by 1.
     - Reset Runs Scored markers to 0.
     - Remove all Base Runners.
     - Discard On Deck card or return it to top of Lineup.
   - **Extra Innings** (if tied):
     - Keep Base Runners on base.
     - Each player draws 3 cards.
     - Simultaneously play one card face down, then reveal.
     - Resolve Home Immediate Action, then Visitor Immediate Action.
     - Resolve Threatened Hits.
     - If still tied, repeat with remaining cards. If all 3 played and still tied, draw 3 new cards.
   - **Buy Round**:
     - Total revenue (green circle) from all cards in In Play Box (including Extra Innings).
     - Player with lowest revenue chooses who buys first (tie: loser of mini-game decides).
     - Buy cards from Buy Row (cost in red diamond); refill Buy Row after each purchase.
     - For each new player bought, send one played card to Minor Leagues (face down, out of game).
     - Remaining played cards go to Dugout.
     - Unplayed Extra Innings cards discarded.
   - **Series End**: First to win required number of mini-games (4 in best-of-7, 6 in best-of-11).

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**
   - **When to shuffle Dugout?** Only when needing to draw a card and Lineup is empty.
   - **Can you look at opponent’s Dugout?** Yes, all discard piles are public.
   - **Can Immediate Actions cancel hits from Immediate Actions?** No. Only Threatened Hits from Hit Boxes can be cancelled.
   - **What if a card has no Hit Boxes?** Speed icon is irrelevant unless modified by expansions.
   - **Does speed affect initial base placement?** No. Batter always goes to 1st on Single, 2nd on Double, etc., regardless of speed.
   - **Can you Pinch Hit in Extra Innings?** Yes, by discarding a PH card to play On Deck or top Lineup card.
