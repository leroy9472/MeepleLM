## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
You are a treasure hunter on the island of Tobago, seeking forgotten treasures buried across its varied terrain. By combining clue cards, players narrow down the possible locations of treasures. The goal is to be the first to reach a fully revealed treasure site, contribute to its discovery, and claim valuable treasure cards. The player who collects the most gold coins from treasure cards at the end of the game wins.

### 2. Components
- Game board (3 double-sided sections, forming 32 possible island configurations)
- 4 huts, 3 palm trees, 3 statues (placed during setup)
- 60 compass roses (15 per player in up to 4 colors)
- 68 site markers (17 per color: grey, brown, black, white)
- 21 amulets
- 52 clue cards
- 39 treasure cards (including 10×2, 9×3, 11×4, 6×5, 3×6 gold value cards)
- 2 curse cards
- 3 clamps (used to assemble the board)
- 4 ATVs (All-Terrain Vehicles, one per player)

### 3. Setup
1. Assemble the island using the three board sections and clamps. Choose any combination of sides (a/A, b/B, c/C).
2. Place 4 huts, 3 palm trees, and 3 statues:
   - No two identical objects may be fewer than four spaces apart (i.e., at least three hexes between).
   - Statues must not be adjacent to the ocean and must face one of the six surrounding spaces.
3. Form the treasure deck:
   - Shuffle the two curse cards into the bottom 27 treasure cards.
   - Place the top 12 treasure cards on top (curse-free).
4. Place the 21 amulets in a supply pile.
5. Each player takes:
   - 1 ATV (place on any island space)
   - 15 compass roses (in their color)
   - 4 clue cards (6 in a 2-player game)
6. Create four treasure map areas:
   - Sort site markers into four colored piles (grey, brown, black, white).
   - Each player draws one clue card and places it face-up under an empty treasure map pile.
   - Place one of their compass roses on that clue card.
7. Shuffle remaining clue cards to form the draw deck.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn:
1. You may **raise a treasure** or **collect an amulet** at any time.
2. Choose **one** of the following actions:
   - **A) Play a clue card**
   - **B) Move your ATV up to 3 legs**
   - **C) Exchange your entire hand of clue cards** (only if you have no amulets and haven’t played any this turn)
3. At any time during your turn, you may **play one or more amulets** to gain special powers.

After your action, your turn ends unless extended by amulet use.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Playing a Clue Card
- Place a clue card under any treasure map column.
- Mark it with one of your compass roses.
- Draw a replacement clue card.
- The clue must:
  - Not contradict existing clues in the column.
  - Reduce the number of possible treasure locations by at least one space.
  - Leave at least one possible location.

#### Moving Your ATV
- Move up to 3 legs per turn.
- A **leg** is:
  - Any distance within the same terrain type.
  - Moving into an adjacent space of a different terrain type.
- ATVs may enter spaces with palm trees, huts, statues, or other ATVs, but **not** the ocean.
- Movement ends if:
  - You raise a treasure.
  - You pick up an amulet (ends that leg only).
- You may not pick up amulets during movement granted by an amulet power.

#### Raising a Treasure
- Conditions:
  - Only one site marker of that color remains on the board.
  - Your ATV occupies that space.
- Procedure:
  1. Place one of your compass roses below the last clue card in the column.
  2. Remove the site marker.
  3. Each player draws one treasure card per compass rose they have in the column.
  4. Cards are passed face-down to the player who raised the treasure.
  5. Add one extra card from the deck and shuffle all cards.
  6. Reveal cards one at a time. Starting from the bottom compass rose, players may claim or pass.
  7. Claiming a card returns the compass rose to the owner.
  8. Unclaimed cards are discarded.
  9. After distribution, the **last player to claim** starts a new treasure map by playing a clue card (unless the first revealed card was a curse; then the treasure raiser starts it).
  10. Place one amulet per statue on the coastal space they face (if unoccupied), then rotate each statue 60° clockwise.

#### Cursed Treasures
- If a curse card is revealed during distribution:
  - Distribution stops immediately.
  - Remaining treasure cards are discarded.
  - The curse card is removed from the game.
  - Any player with compass roses on the map must:
    - Discard an amulet, or
    - Discard their most valuable treasure card.
  - Compass roses are returned to owners.

#### Amulet Powers
You may play any number of amulets during your turn. Each grants one of the following:
- **Play a clue card** – Extra action to play and mark a clue card.
- **Move your ATV** – Extra 3-leg movement. Cannot pick up amulets during this move.
- **Exchange clue cards** – Discard all and redraw same number.
- **Remove a site marker** – Remove any site marker of a color (but at least one must remain on the board).
- **Protect against a curse** – Discard to avoid losing your most valuable treasure card when cursed.
- **Double-Claim (Optional Rule)** – Place 2 compass roses on a newly played clue card, or add a second rose to one of your clues that has only one.
- **Swap compass roses (Optional Rule)** – Swap positions of two single roses or two double-claim sets on the same treasure map.

#### Collecting Amulets
- If your ATV starts your turn on an amulet, collect it as a free action.
- If you move into an amulet space, you must end that leg to collect it.
- You may collect multiple amulets in one turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- The game ends when the treasure deck is exhausted **after** completing a treasure distribution.
- If more cards are needed during distribution, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.
- After the final distribution, the game ends immediately.
- Players total the gold value of all treasure cards in their possession.
- The player with the most gold wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you raise a treasure at the start of your turn?** Yes. You may raise it before taking your action.
- **Can you raise multiple treasures in one turn?** Yes, if you use amulet-powered movement to reach others.
- **Can treasures be under huts, statues, or palm trees?** Yes.
- **Can you use an amulet to move after playing a clue card?** Yes, at any time during your turn.
- **Can you pick up an amulet after exchanging your hand?** Only if you used an amulet to do so; otherwise, exchanging without an amulet forfeits your turn.
- **What if no clue can reduce a treasure’s possible sites?** In turn order, each player removes one site marker from a treasure not yet narrowed to one location, then play continues.
- **Are ocean spaces valid?** No. The ocean surrounds the island but is not part of it.
