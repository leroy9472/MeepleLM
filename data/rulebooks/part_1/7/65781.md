## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
London is a strategy board game set in historical London, where players act as developers and city planners expanding their influence across the city. The goal is to amass the most Victory Points (VPs) by building infrastructure, acquiring boroughs, managing poverty, and strategically using loans and public institutions. Players must balance economic growth with social consequences (Poverty) to win.

### 2. Components  
- Three shuffled decks of cards: Deck A (top), Deck B (middle), Deck C (bottom)  
- Card Display (used for discarding and card access)  
- Building counters (to place in boroughs)  
- Borough markers (track ownership)  
- Underground counters (for Underground network)  
- Poverty cubes/disks (track Poverty Points)  
- Money ($1, $3, $5 denominations)  
- Loan tokens (each worth $10)  
- Score track (optional: 2017 version may use Prestige track)  
- Player aids and score sheets  

### 3. Setup  
- **Deck Setup**: Shuffle Decks A, B, and C separately. Stack them with Deck C on the bottom, then B, then A on top.  
- **Player Start**: Each player receives:  
  - £5  
  - 5 Poverty Points (PPs)  
  - 6 cards  
- **Card Display**:  
  - 2 players: 3 slots per row  
  - 3 players: 4 slots per row  
  - 4 players: 5 slots per row  
  - Discarded cards go to the top row first; when full, overflow to bottom row. When both rows are full and a discard is needed, remove top row from game, shift bottom row up, place new discards in bottom row.  
- **First Player**: Randomly determine starting player. Play proceeds clockwise.  
- **First Building Placement**: First player must place in one of the three central starting boroughs: City, Southwark & Bermondsey, or Westminster. Subsequent placements must be adjacent to an existing building (including opponents’), with bridges allowing adjacency across the Thames.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each player’s turn follows this sequence:

1. **Draw a Card**  
   - Take 1 card from either the deck or the Card Display.  
   - Hand size may exceed 9 during this phase.

2. **Take One Action** (choose exactly one):  
   - **Play Cards**:  
     - Play one or more cards to your Building Display.  
     - To play a card, discard a card of the same color to the Card Display.  
     - Cards with a stone base may be placed.  
     - A card may start a new stack or be placed on top of a previously played (but not same-turn) card.  
     - Permanent powers (text above card image) take effect immediately.  
     - Action-only cards (Huguenots, Jewish Refugees, Wren, Paupers) are removed after use and do not require a same-color discard.  
   - **Run City**:  
     - Activate some or all cards in your Building Display, in any order.  
     - For each activated card: pay costs, gain benefits, flip cards if indicated.  
     - Special: Activating an Underground card allows placement of 2 Underground counters.  
       - First counter must be in City or adjacent borough.  
       - All counters must be placed in boroughs with buildings (any player’s).  
       - Counters must be adjacent to existing Underground counters (bridge required to cross Thames; pay £3 per crossing).  
       - Each borough can have only one Underground counter.  
     - After activation, calculate Poverty change:  
       PPs gained = (Number of stacks in Building Display) + (Cards in hand) – (Number of boroughs you control)  
     - You cannot go below 0 Poverty.  
   - **Buy Land**:  
     - Pay the cost shown on the borough.  
     - Draw the number of cards indicated.  
     - Place your building counter in an unoccupied borough.  
     - First placement must be in one of the three starting boroughs.  
     - All other placements must be adjacent to any occupied borough (including opponents’).  
     - Adjacency across the Thames requires a bridge.  
   - **Draw 3 Cards**:  
     - Take 3 cards from the deck.  
     - No other action may be taken this turn.

3. **Discard Down to 9 Cards**  
   - If your hand exceeds 9 cards, discard down to 9, placing excess in the Card Display (top row if possible).

**Loans**:  
- May be taken at any time during your turn if you need money.  
- Each loan provides £10.  
- Repay £15 per £10 loan at end of game; unpaid loans cost 7 VP each.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Poverty System  
- Poverty accumulates during the game through:  
  - Running the City: PPs = Stacks + Hand cards – Boroughs  
  - End of Game: 1 PP per card in hand  
  - Loans: In base 2010 rules, no loan-based PP; in 2017 and hybrid rules, +1 PP per £10 of outstanding loans after Running the City.  
- At end of game:  
  - All players add 1 PP per card in hand.  
  - The player with the lowest PP discards all their PPs.  
  - All other players discard the same amount.  
  - Remaining PPs are penalized per the Poverty Table:  
    - 1–2 PPs: –1 VP  
    - 3 PPs: –2 VP  
    - 4 PPs: –3 VP  
    - 5–10 PPs: –1 VP per PP  
    - 11+ PPs: –10 VP, then –3 VP per PP over 10  

#### Boroughs  
- **2010 Rules**:  
  - No Borough cards; VP awarded at end of game based on borough value on board.  
  - Each owned borough reduces Poverty by 1 when Running the City.  
- **2017 Rules**:  
  - 20 Borough cards; 3 available at a time.  
  - Buying a Borough grants immediate Prestige (not EOG).  
  - New Borough card covers previous one; only current card’s “Running the City” effects apply.  
  - 6 Boroughs have special “Running the City” effects (Poverty changes):  
    - Hammersmith (–1), Paddington (–1), Battersea (–2)  
    - Southwark & Bermondsey (+1), Wandsworth (+2)  
    - Greenwich (–3), Hackney (–1), Kensington (–1), Lambeth (–1)  
- **Hybrid Scenarios**:  
  - Option 1: Use 2017-style small cards with 2010 £/Cards/VP values and 2017 Poverty values. All “Running the City” texts remain active (no stacking).  
  - Option 4: Use 2010 rules but:  
    - Start with 0 Poverty (not +5)  
    - +1 PP per £10 loan  
    - –1 PP per 2 Boroughs (rounded down) when Running the City  

#### Underground  
- **2010**:  
  - Activate by discarding any card during Run City.  
  - Place 2 counters; pay £3 to cross Thames.  
  - EOG: 2 VP per counter in your borough.  
- **2017**:  
  - Activate: Gain 3 Prestige +1 per owned borough. Pay £2 if you own both north and south boroughs.  
  - No EOG benefit (no counters used).  
- **Hybrid Option 5**: Use 2010 counters with 2017 card effects.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Trigger**:  
- When the last card is drawn from the deck, the current player finishes their turn.  
- Then, each other player takes one final turn.  

**End of Game Scoring**:  
1. **Repay Loans**: Pay £15 per £10 loan. Unpaid loans cost 7 VP each.  
2. **Final Poverty Calculation**:  
   - Add 1 PP per card in hand.  
   - Total PPs = current PPs + hand cards.  
   - Lowest PP player discards all PPs.  
   - All others discard that same amount.  
   - Remaining PPs are penalized per Poverty Table.  
3. **Victory Points**:  
   - 1 VP per £3 (round down)  
   - Borough VPs: as marked on board (2010) or card (2017/hybrid)  
   - +2 VP per borough with your Underground counter (2010/hybrid only)  
   - VPs from all cards in Building Display (even if flipped or covered)  
   - VPs gained during play (e.g., from card effects)  
4. **Deduct**:  
   - 7 VP per unpaid £10 loan  
   - Poverty penalties (per table)  

**Winning**:  
- Highest total VP wins.  
- Tiebreakers in order:  
  1. Fewest Poverty Points  
  2. Most Boroughs controlled  
  3. Highest single VP-valued card in Building Display  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I go below 0 Poverty?**  
  No. Minimum is 0, both during and after Running the City.  
- **Can I play a card without discarding a same-color card?**  
  Only if it’s an action card (Huguenots, Wren, etc.), which are removed after use.  
- **Can I place a building in a non-adjacent borough?**  
  No. After the first placement, all must be adjacent to any occupied borough (own or opponent’s), with bridge required to cross Thames.  
- **What happens when Card Display is full?**  
  Top row is removed from game, bottom row moves up, new discards go to bottom row.  
- **Can I use a permanent power more than once?**  
  No. Permanent powers trigger once when the card is played.  
- **Do flipped cards still score VP?**  
  Yes. All cards in Building Display score their stated VP, regardless of flip or coverage.  
- **Can I take a loan during another player’s turn?**  
  No. Loans can only be taken during your own turn.
