## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players lead research teams in an underwater station, programming bots to gather crystals, conduct research, and control sectors. The goal is to score the most Knowledge Points (KP), referred to as Victory Points (VP) in some sources, over four rounds.

2. Components  
- 6 Sectors forming the Research Station  
- 6 Center Tiles (double-sided, selected by player count)  
- 1 Headquarters board with Programming Section, Play Order Track, Pass Order Track, Knowledge Track, and Full Circle Counting Track  
- 7 Programming Tiles  
- 7 Program Cards (4 used per game)  
- 4 Player Boards (each with Bot/Program Symbols, Submarine slots, and Supply areas)  
- 4 Base Labs (1 per player)  
- 30 Lab Expansions  
- 41 Research Cards  
- 20 Crystals  
- 38 Time Markers  
- 15 Octopods  
- 4 Scientists, 4 Engineers, 24 Submarines (6 per player), 64 Bots (16 per player)  
- 2 Counters per player (KP and Full Circle Counting Track)  
- 3 Setup Overview Cards (by player count)

3. Setup  
1. Assemble the 6 Sectors in random order.  
2. Create face-down stacks of Research Cards and Lab Expansions.  
3. Place 1 Research Card next to the red area and 1 Lab Expansion next to the green area in each Sector.  
4. Stack Center Tiles (5 on bottom to 2 on top) with random orientation in the center of the Station.  
5. Assemble the Headquarters.  
6. Shuffle Program Cards and place 4 face-up next to HQ; use top card to place 7 Programming Tiles on HQ spaces, then discard it.  
7. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
   - 1 Base Lab (randomly assigned; letter indicates Starting Sector)  
   - 1 Player Board  
   - 6 Submarines (place on Player Board)  
   - 1 Scientist (place in blue area of Starting Sector)  
   - 1 Engineer (place on Start space of Programming Section)  
   - 1 KP counter (on 0 of Knowledge Track)  
   - 1 Full Circle counter (on 0+ of Full Circle Track)  
   - 16 Bots (14 on Player Board, 1 on Programming space matching white area color in Starting Sector)  
8. Players adjacent to a '0' Lock gain 3 Time Tokens; others gain 4.  
9. Starting player places 1 Bot on first space of Play Order Track; others follow clockwise.  
10. Using the Setup Card for player count:  
   - Place resources (Octopods, Crystals, Submarines) in Starting Sectors as specified.  
   - Deploy neutral Submarines/Bots in empty Sectors if playing 2 or 3 players.  
11. Draw and place additional Base Labs to assign remaining Sectors.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- The game lasts 4 Rounds.  
- On a turn, choose one of three actions:  
  a) Program a Bot  
  b) Carry Out an Action with a Programmed Bot  
  c) Pass  
- Turns proceed in Play Order Track order until all players pass.  
- End of Round: Perform Intermediate Scoring, refill Station, prepare next round.  
- After Round 4: Conduct Final Scoring. Highest KP wins.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Program a Bot**:  
  - Move Engineer 1 space along arrows in HQ; place a Bot on the corresponding Program Symbol on your board.  
  - OR once per round, pay 3 Time Tokens to place a Bot on any available Program Symbol (mark with 1 Token in top-right corner of board).  
  - Max 2 programmed Bots at a time. Exceeding this requires returning one Bot to supply (gain 2 Time Tokens).  
  - At any time, return a programmed Bot to supply for 2 Time Tokens (free action).  

- **Carry Out an Action with a Programmed Bot**:  
  1. Optional: Move Scientist to another Sector, paying Time Tokens for each Lock (0–2) crossed.  
  2. Place Scientist in a colored Action Area matching a programmed Bot.  
  3. Move that Bot to the Control Space of the Sector. Displaced Bot goes to Loading Station.  
     - Loading Station limits: 2P=2 Bots, 3P=4 Bots, 4P=5 Bots.  
     - If limit exceeded, each player returns all but 1 Bot to supply.  
  4. Perform the Action:  
     - **Expand Lab (Green)**: Take top Lab Expansion; if it has letter(s), place 1 Bot from supply in corresponding Sector(s). Max 5 Expansions.  
     - **Take Time Markers (Yellow)**: Take up to capacity from Sector; if fewer than 2, take from supply to total 2.  
     - **Take Crystals (Black)**: Take up to capacity.  
     - **Catch Octopods (Purple)**: Catch up to capacity; score KP: 1=1, 2=3, 3=6, 4=10, 5=15, >5=21. Return to supply.  
     - **Place Submarine (Blue)**: Place leftmost Submarine in Sector; pay Time Tokens shown; score KP from Center Tile. Max 1 per Sector.  
     - **Take Research Card (Red)**: Take top card if space available; score KP from Center Tile. Cards are permanent.  
     - **Program a Bot (White)**: Place next Bot from supply on Program Symbol matching white area’s symbol. If occupied, gain 2 Time Tokens instead.  

- **Pass**: Move Engineer to next free space on Pass Order Track. No further actions this round.

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Intermediate Scoring (after each round)**:  
1. Gain 1 Time Token per deployed Submarine.  
2. Return 3-Time-Token marker (if used) to supply.  
3. Use Research Cards with (II) symbol.  
4. Calculate KP:  
   a) **Majority on Control Spaces**: Most Bots on Control Spaces → 6 KP. Tie → 3 KP each.  
   b) **Bots in Play**: Highest uncovered number in a column without a deployed Submarine → KP equal to number.  
   c) **Crystals**: Score KP: 1=1, 2=3, 3=6, 4=10, 5=15, >5=21.  
   d) **Octopod Penalty**: For each Sector you control, lose KP based on leftover Octopods: 1=-1, 2=-3, 3=-6, 4=-10, 5=-15, >5=-21.  
5. Adjust KP counter: Pay 1 Crystal per red line crossed. If unable, return 1 programmed Bot (no Time Tokens). Cannot fall behind red line.  
6. Refill Station:  
   - Place new Research Card and Lab Expansion in each Sector.  
   - Add resources per Center Tile (remove old Time Markers; add Crystals/Octopods to existing).  
   - In 2/3P: Place neutral Submarines (max 1 per color per Sector; move clockwise if full).  
7. Discard top Center Tile.  
8. Reorder Play Order Track to match Pass Order Track.  
9. Return Engineers to Start space.  
10. Rearrange Programming Tiles per next Program Card; discard that card.

**Final Scoring (after Round 4)**:  
1. **Lab Letters**: Score KP for unique letters in Lab: 1=1, 2=3, 3=6, 4=10, 5=15, >5=21.  
2. **Time Tokens**: 1 KP per remaining Time Token.  
3. **Submarines**: 5 KP if all 6 deployed.  
4. **Completed Lab**: 5 KP for 5 Expansions.  
- Red lines ignored.  
- **Tiebreakers**: Most Bots on Control Spaces → Most Crystals.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Lab Capacity**: Limits apply to Research Cards (2), Crystals (2), Octopods (2), Time Markers (4) initially. Expansions increase capacity.  
- **Returning Bots**: Can return a programmed Bot at any time for 2 Time Tokens, except when paying to cross a red line (no reward).  
- **Neutral Pieces (2/3P)**: Unused colors are neutral; used for Submarines and Bots in empty Sectors.  
- **Research Cards**:  
  - Permanent: Trigger when Engineer lands on tile, when catching Octopods, or during movement.  
  - One-time: Use immediately or during Intermediate Scoring.  
  - Do not stack; cannot be discarded.  
- **Control Space**: Only one Bot per Sector; displaced Bot goes to Loading Station.  
- **Passing**: Can pass even with programmed Bots; they remain for next round.  
- **Final Scoring**: No crystal cost for red lines; all points count.
