## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In One Night Ultimate Werewolf, players take on secret roles as members of the Villager team or the Werewolf team (and possibly other factions). The game lasts a single night followed by a day phase, during which players debate and vote to eliminate a player. The goal is to achieve team-specific victory conditions based on who lives or dies.

2. Components  
- Role cards (including Villager, Werewolf, Minion, Tanner, Hunter, Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Drunk, Mason, Insomniac, and others)  
- Center cards (3 more role cards than players are used, placed face-down in the center)  
- Optional: tokens or markers to track roles, artifacts, or status effects (e.g., "Mark of Love", "Diseased")  
- Free companion app (recommended for managing wake order and announcements)

3. Setup  
- Choose a set of role cards: use 3 more cards than the number of players.  
- Shuffle all role cards and randomly deal one to each player.  
- Place the remaining 3 cards face-down in the center of the table.  
- Players close their eyes and keep them closed unless instructed otherwise.  
- Use the app or an announcer to guide wake-up phases in correct order.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of a single night phase followed by a day phase:  
1. Night Phase: Roles wake up in a specific order to perform actions.

  - If Tanner is in play, Werewolves win only if no Werewolf dies **and** Tanner survives.

- **Villager Team** (Villager, Seer, Mason, Robber (if didn’t steal evil role), etc.):  
  - Win if at least one Werewolf dies.  
  - If no Werewolf is in play, Villagers win only if **no one dies**.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Robber steals a role that wakes later**: Robber does **not** wake again, even if the new role would normally wake.  
- **Doppelgänger views a role**: The role’s effect is tied to the **Doppelgänger player**. If the role is later moved (e.g., by Troublemaker), the Doppelgänger still retains the original viewed role.  
- **Optional vs. Mandatory Actions**:  
  - Optional: Doppelgänger, Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Insomniac  
  - Mandatory: Werewolves, Masons, Drunk, Minion  
- **Hunter effect**: Triggers only if Hunter is eliminated. The targeted player dies regardless of vote count.  
- **Prince**: Cannot be killed (not in base game, but referenced in expanded content).  
- **No Werewolves in play**:  
  - Villagers win only if no one dies.  
  - Minion wins if someone dies (but not Minion) and Tanner survives.  
  - Tanner wins if he dies.
