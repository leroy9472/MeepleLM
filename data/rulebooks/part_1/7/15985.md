## Dungeon Brawl — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Dungeon Brawl is a chaotic, fun-focused board game inspired by Blood Bowl and dungeon-crawl mechanics. It is not intended as a serious competitive game but as a social, high-energy experience best played with 4 or more teams. The objective is to be the first team to carry the ball into any declared "end zone" located at the far reaches of the dungeon.

### 2. Components
- Dungeon tiles (e.g., Warhammer Quest, Master Maze, or custom boards)
- Player miniatures (4 per team)
- 10 numbered teleporters (0–9)
- 6–16 chest/barrel markers (one contains the ball)
- 4–6 trap markers per coach (mix of blanks, pits, spiked pits)
- Ball token
- Rosters for tracking player status
- Dice (D6, D10)

### 3. Setup
**Dungeon Layout:**
- Central starting room: At least 10×10 squares. All teams begin here.
- For 8+ teams: Use two connected central rooms.
- Dungeon entrance: Located off the central room; point where injured players return.
- End zones: 1–2 areas in distant corners of the dungeon, far from the center.
- Corridors: Mostly 2 squares wide; rooms vary in size.

**Game Element Placement:**
- **Teleporters (10 total, numbered 0–9):** Placed evenly throughout the dungeon by the game commissioner. Avoid placing near end zones.
- **Chests (6–16):** One contains the ball. Placed by the commissioner, closer to the center than teleporters. Never in end zone rooms.
- **Trap Markers (4–6 per coach):**
  - 6 per coach (≤6 coaches): 1 spiked pit, 2 pits, 3 blanks
  - 4 per coach (7+ coaches): 1 spiked pit, 1 pit, 2 blanks
  - Coaches place traps face-down (neutral side up). Traps may block corridors only if one is a blank (cannot fully block with two pits).
  - Traps cannot be placed to completely obstruct passage unless one is a blank.

**Team Setup:**
- Each coach selects 4 players (max 1 Big Guy or Star player).
- Teams start in the central room; all 4 players adjacent, at least 2 squares from other teams.
- Coaches use rosters to track player status (normal → hurt → crippled → dead).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Player Turns:** Coaches take turns. On a turn:
   - First, warp any opponent players currently on teleporters.
   - Then, activate one or more of their players in any order.
2. **Player Activation:**
   - Move, block, open chests, pass, or blitz.
   - Turnover events end only that player’s action, not the entire team’s turn.
3. **End of Turn:** Proceed to next coach.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Movement:**
- Move up to MA in squares.
- Diagonal movement allowed, but not around corners, traps, or obstacles.
- "Go For It!" costs 2 extra MA; failure causes fall and armor roll (no team re-rolls).
- Tackle zones and dodging work as in Blood Bowl.

**Teleporters:**
- Stepping on a teleporter: Roll D10. Player appears on teleporter with that number.
  - If roll matches current teleporter number: player is "lost in space" and removed.
- **With the ball:**
  - Roll separately for player and ball.
  - Ball scatters 1 square from its destination teleporter.
  - If player and ball land on same teleporter, possession is retained.
- **Unwilling entry (e.g., block into teleporter):**
  - Immediate warp.
  - Player remains on teleporter until next coach’s turn, when all such players are warped.
- **Warp Push:** If warping player lands on an occupied teleporter, the other player warps again (cannot stay) and may be lost or pushed elsewhere.

**Blocking & Blitzing:**
- Blocks use standard Blood Bowl mechanics.
- Blitzing allowed with all players; no limit per turn.
- **Assisting from third-party players:**
  - Players from other teams in adjacent squares may choose whom to assist.
  - Cannot assist if in another team’s tackle zone (to prevent disputes).

**Chests:**
- To open: Move adjacent, spend 1 MA.
- **If no ball:** Chest explodes. All adjacent players suffer a "Mighty Blow" (Block result with +1 to armor and injury rolls).
- **If ball is inside:** Ball appears where chest was. Player may pick it up if they have MA left to enter the square (normal catch rules apply).

**Traps (Pits, Spiked Pits, Blanks):**
- Triggered when a player steps on the marker (flip to reveal).
  - **Blank:** Nothing happens. Remove marker.
  - **Pit:** Player falls in. Roll armor and injury.
  - **Spiked Pit:** Player falls in. Roll injury immediately (no armor roll).
- Multiple players can occupy a pit.
- **Ball in a pit:** Dropped beneath the player. Does not scatter.
- **Escaping a pit:**
  - Roll Agility check.
  - +1 to roll if not carrying the ball.
  - Failure: Stay in pit until next turn.
- **Passing from a pit:**
  - Roll 1D6. On 1: fumble, ball stays in pit (turnover).
  - On 2–6: ball scatters 1 square from target square (or caught if player present).

**Passing:**
- **Normal Pass:** As in Blood Bowl.
- **Bounce Pass:** Thrown at wall at 45° or 22.5° angle; reflects like a billiard ball.
  - Can be any pass type (Quick, Short, Long, Bomb).
  - Distance: 1D6 squares per range unit (e.g., Long Pass = 3D6 squares).
  - Scatter or catch rules apply upon landing.
  - Fumble rules apply.

**Injury & Status:**
- All injuries are temporary (reset after game).
- **First injury:** Player becomes "hurt" — loses all skills.
- **Second injury:** Player becomes "crippled" — Strength halved (round down).
- **Third injury:** Player is "dead" — permanently removed.
- **Injury Roll Results:**
  - **Badly Hurt:** Knocked down; becomes hurt.
  - **Serious Injury:** Removed from dungeon; becomes crippled if not already. Returns via entrance next turn if still alive.
  - **Dead:** Counted as two injuries. Removed. Returns next turn if not yet dead (i.e., from normal → crippled).

**Returning to Play:**
- Injured players (Serious Injury or Dead result) return via dungeon entrance on next turn if not fully dead.
- Crippled status applies upon return if second injury occurred.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition:** A player carrying the ball enters any end zone.
- Game ends immediately when condition is met.
- No scoring system — single winner by objective.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you block through a teleporter?** No. Movement and blocks must follow legal paths.
- **What if a warping player rolls the same number twice in a row?** On first roll: lost in space. Second roll doesn't occur.
- **Can you assist a block from within a pit?** Yes, if adjacent and not in another team’s tackle zone.
- **Can a player in a pit be targeted for a pass?** Yes. Ball scatters from square above the pit.
- **Do trap markers block movement?** Only if placed as a pair (blank + pit). Two pits side-by-side are illegal.
- **Can a player with 0 MA still act?** Yes — can still be involved in blocks, catches, or open chests if adjacent (but cannot move).
