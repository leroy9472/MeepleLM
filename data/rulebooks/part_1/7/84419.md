## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Space Empires 4X is a classic 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) space strategy game. Players grow their empires by colonizing planets, gathering resources, researching technologies, and building fleets. The primary objective is to eliminate all other players by destroying their Homeworlds. Victory is achieved when only one player remains.

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player selects a color and places their Homeworld and Home System markers in their designated Home System.  
2. Shuffle face-down System markers: colored-border markers go in Home Systems, white-border markers in Deep Space.  
3. Place Homeworld in a hex of the player’s Home System.  
4. Each player starts with:  
   - 1 Ship Yard (SY) at Homeworld  
   - 2 Colony Ships  
   - 2 Mining Ships  
   - 2 Scouts  
   - Initial CP income: 20 CP from Homeworld  
5. Player order for Turn 1 is determined by die roll.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each full cycle consists of three turns followed by an Economic Phase:  

**Per Turn (in player order):**  
1. **Movement Phase**  
   - Move units according to Movement Technology Level.  
   - Colonize planets, reveal systems, trigger exploration effects.  
2. **Combat Phase**  
   - Mandatory combat in hexes with opposing combat-capable units.  
   - Resolve battles one at a time (attacker chooses order).  
3. **Exploration Phase**  
   - Reveal face-down System markers in hexes occupied by units.  
   - Resolve immediate effects (e.g., Black Hole, Supernova).  

**After 3 Turns: Economic Phase (simultaneous)**  
1. Collect Colony Income  
2. Collect Mineral/Space Wreck Income  
3. Deduct Maintenance Costs  
4. Bid for Player Order (using CPs)  
5. Purchase Technology and Units  
6. Place New Units at Ship Yards  
7. Adjust Colony Counters (growth)

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Movement  
- **Movement Tech Levels**:  
  - Level 1: 1 hex per turn  
  - Level 2: 1 hex in Turns 1–2, 2 in Turn 3  
  - Level 3: 1 in Turn 1, 2 in Turns 2–3  
  - Level 4: 2 hexes all turns  
  - Level 5: 2 in Turns 1–2, 3 in Turn 3  
  - Level 6: 2 in Turn 1, 3 in Turns 2–3  
  - Level 7: 3 hexes all turns  
- Non-combat ships (Colony Ships, Miners, MS Pipelines, Mines) move only 1 hex per turn.  
- Units cannot enter unexplored, Nebula, or Asteroid hexes unless adjacent at start of turn; movement ends upon entry.  

#### Combat  
- **Initiation**: Occurs when enemy combat-capable units share a hex.  
- **Attacker/Defender**: Moving player is attacker.  
- **Battle Resolution Steps**:  
  1. Move units off board; eliminate decoys.  
  2. Reveal all units.  
  3. Defender detonates mines (after minesweeping).  
  4. Form battle lines by Class (A → E).  
  5. Determine Combat Screening (player with more combat ships may screen up to the difference).  
  6. Apply Fleet Size Bonus (+1 Attack if one side has 2× more unscreened combat ships).  
  7. Resolve fire by Class (A fires before B, etc.).  
     - Tiebreaker: Higher Tactics Tech fires first.  
     - Still tied: Defender fires first.  
     - In Asteroids/Nebulae: All ships are Class E; Tactics breaks ties.  
  8. Apply hits; destroy ships when hits ≥ Hull Size.  
  9. Repeat combat rounds until one side retreats or is destroyed.  
- **Retreat**:  
  - Allowed after first firing round.  
  - Must retreat to adjacent hex without enemy units.  
  - Must be closer to or same distance from a friendly colony (ignoring battle hex colony).  
  - Bases and Ship Yards cannot retreat.  

#### Colonization  
- A Colony Ship may land on a planet to begin colonization.  
- Colony Ship is removed; planet becomes a colony (1 CP) in next Economic Phase.  
- Barren planets require Terraforming Technology.  
- Colonies grow: 1 CP → 3 CP → 5 CP over Economic Phases.  

#### Technology  
- Purchased during Economic Phase.  
- Types: Attack, Defense, Tactics, Ship Size, Movement, Ship Yard, Terraforming, Exploration, Cloaking, Scanners, Fighters, Point Defense, Mines, Mine Sweepers.  
- Attack/Defense Tech cannot exceed Hull Size.  
- Ships built with current tech; existing ships must upgrade at Ship Yards (cost: Hull Size CP, must stay idle for full turn).  

#### Special Units  
- **Decoys**: Non-combat; removed when revealed. Can be built for 1 CP at any colony.  
- **Bases**: Built at income-producing colonies. Immovable, no maintenance, participate in combat, cannot retreat.  
- **Ship Yards**: Built at income-producing colonies. Enable ship construction. Capacity increases with Ship Yard Tech.  
- **MS Pipelines**: Form chains for trade bonus (+1 CP per connected colony) and movement aid (extra hex for ships on chain).  
- **Fighters & Carriers**:  
  - Fighters require Carrier or colony.  
  - Carriers protect fighters; cannot be targeted until fighters are destroyed.  
  - Fighters upgrade at Ship Yards (1 CP per squadron).  
- **Raiders & Cloaking**:  
  - Cloaked Raiders avoid combat if enemy lacks Scanners or has lower Scanner Tech.  
  - In combat, Cloaked Raiders have Class A and +1 Attack in first round.  
- **Mines & Mine Sweepers**:  
  - Mines destroy one ship each when triggered.  
  - Mine Sweepers remove mines before detonation (1 or 2 per sweeper, based on tech).  

#### Exploration Effects  
- **Black Hole**: Enter → roll 1–6 to survive (7–10 = destroyed).  
- **Supernova**: Must retreat to previous hex; impassable thereafter.  
- **Lost in Space**: Player to right shifts unit 1 hex; may trigger combat or exploration.  
- **Danger!**: All units destroyed; marker removed.  
- **Minerals**: Towed by Miners; provide one-time CP bonus.  
- **Space Wreck**: Grants free tech upgrade (roll to determine).  
- **Warp Points**: Allow instant travel between matching numbers.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory Condition**: Eliminate all other players by destroying their Homeworlds.  
- Homeworld destroyed at 5 CP if hit.  
- Game ends immediately when only one player remains.  
- No formal scoring; survival and expansion are key.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you retreat into a hex with your own colony?** Yes, if it meets retreat distance rules.  
- **Do blockaded colonies grow?** Yes, but do not produce income.  
- **Can you screen individual ships?** No; only groups. But groups can be split before combat.  
- **Do fighters count for fleet size bonus?** Yes, each squadron counts as one combat-capable ship.  
- **Can a Carrier retreat and leave fighters behind?** Only if another Carrier or colony is present to absorb them.  
- **Do Mines work against cloaked Raiders?** Only if enemy has Scanner Tech ≥ Cloaking Tech.  
- **Can you build a Ship Yard on a newly colonized planet?** No; must wait until it produces income (i.e., flipped to 1 CP).  
- **Is movement required to deliver minerals?** No; can be deposited when entering or leaving a colony hex.  
- **Can Raiders attack colonies?** Only after defeating all enemy combat ships in the hex.  
- **Can you use MS Pipeline movement bonus and Black Hole slingshot together?** No; optional rules prohibit combining.
