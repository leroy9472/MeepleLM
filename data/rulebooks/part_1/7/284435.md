## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Nova Luna is a tile-laying strategy game where players build personal displays of tiles to complete color-based goals. The goal is to be the first to place all 20 of your goal discs by completing goals on your tiles. The game emphasizes planning, spatial reasoning, and adaptability as tile availability diminishes over time.

### 2. Components
- 68 tiles in 4 colors (17 each of blue, red, turquoise, yellow)
- 84 discs (21 per player in 4 colors: 1 used as a player disc, 20 as goal discs)
- 1 Moon Wheel (circular board with outer selection track and inner moon track)
- 1 Marker (for the selection track)

### 3. Setup
1. Place the Moon Wheel in the center of the table.
2. Place the Marker on the space above the golden field ("new moon" position) on the outer selection track.
3. Shuffle all tiles face-down and place 11 randomly drawn tiles face-up on the spaces around the Moon Wheel.
4. Form draw piles from the remaining face-down tiles and place them near the board.
5. Each player selects a color and takes 21 discs of that color (1 for player tracking, 20 for goals).
6. For turn order: Each player places 1 disc in the center; one player draws them randomly to form a stack (first drawn at the bottom, last on top). Place this stack on the starting space of the moon track. The top disc determines the first player.

*Beginner Note:* For easier games, reduce goal disc count: 3 players use 18 discs, 4 players use 16.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns in order determined by their position on the moon track:
- The player whose disc is furthest behind takes the next turn.
- If multiple discs are tied for furthest back, the one on top of the stack goes.

On a player’s turn, perform these steps in order:

#### 1. Fill the Selection Track (Optional/Required)
- If 1 or 2 tiles remain on the selection track, you may refill it.
- If 0 tiles remain, you must refill it.
- Refill clockwise starting from the space after the Marker.
- Leave existing tiles in place; only fill empty spaces.
- Draw from face-down piles until the track has 11 tiles or no more tiles remain.

#### 2. Select a Tile and Move the Marker
- From the Marker, choose one of the next 3 face-up tiles in clockwise order (skip empty spaces).
- Take that tile.
- Move the Marker to the space from which you removed the tile.
- You must select a tile each turn; skipping is not allowed.

#### 3. Advance Player Disk
- Move your player disc clockwise on the moon track by the number shown in the top-left corner of the selected tile (1–7).
- If the space is occupied, place your disc on top of the stack.

#### 4. Place Tile
- Add the selected tile to your personal display.
- First tile starts your display.
- Subsequent tiles must be placed orthogonally adjacent to an existing tile.
- Place tile with number in top-left corner upright (rotation allowed, but orientation doesn’t affect rules).
- You must place a tile each turn; saving is not allowed.

#### 5. Complete Goals
- Each tile has 0–3 goals (circles with colored dots).
- A goal is completed when adjacent (orthogonal) tiles match the required colors and quantities.
- The tile's own color never counts toward its goals.
- Chains: Orthogonally connected tiles of the same color form a chain. Only one tile in the chain needs to be adjacent to the goal tile. The total chain length counts toward goal fulfillment.
- Example: A “2 Blue” goal can be met by two separate blue tiles adjacent to the goal tile, or one blue tile adjacent to the goal and another blue tile adjacent to the first.
- Diagonals do not count.
- Each goal is independent—even on the same tile—and may share tiles.
- For each completed goal, cover it with one of your goal discs.
- Multiple goals can be completed in a single turn across any tiles in your display.

After completing goals, if you have no goal discs left, you win. Otherwise, play continues.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Turn Order:** Determined dynamically by player disc positions on the moon track.
- **Tile Selection:** Limited to the next 3 available tiles after the Marker.
- **Tile Placement:** Must form a connected orthogonal display.
- **Goal Completion:** Based on orthogonal adjacency and color-matching; chains amplify value.
- **Refill Rule:** Triggered when ≤2 tiles remain on the selection track.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends under two conditions:
1. **Win by Completion:** A player places all 20 goal discs (or 18/16 in beginner games). That player wins immediately.
2. **Win by Tile Exhaustion:** If no tiles remain to refill the selection track, the game ends. The winner is the player with the fewest goal discs remaining.
   - Tiebreaker: Among tied players, the one who would take the next turn wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I place a tile that doesn’t help complete goals?**  
  Yes. There are no color restrictions on placement.

- **Do diagonally adjacent tiles count for goals?**  
  No. Only orthogonally adjacent (up/down/left/right) tiles count.

- **Can the same tile help complete multiple goals?**  
  Yes. A single tile (or chain) can contribute to multiple goals, even on different tiles.

- **What happens if I complete a goal after placing a tile, but later place another tile that breaks the adjacency?**  
  Once a goal is completed and covered with a disc, it remains completed. Future changes do not undo it.

- **If multiple players are tied for furthest back, how is turn order resolved?**  
  The disc on top of the stack takes the turn.

- **Can I skip refilling the selection track if only 1 or 2 tiles remain?**  
  You may choose not to refill if 1 or 2 tiles remain. But if 0 tiles remain at the start of your turn, you must refill.
