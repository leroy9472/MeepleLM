## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The heroines battle a powerful boss in a fast-paced, pattern-based combat game. The objective is for the heroines to break all of the boss’s shields before being overwhelmed. The boss wins if all heroines lose their lives.

2. Components  
- Heroine boards (one per player)  
- Boss boards  
- Action Point (AP) markers  
- Pattern cards (unique to each heroine and boss)  
- Bullets (tokens used as damage/activation resources)  
- Team action cards (used in multiplayer only)  
- Shield slots on boss board  
- Incoming bullet area (shared)  
- Center bullet pool  

3. Setup  
- Each player selects a heroine board:  
  - Place AP marker at the top of the AP track.  
  - Shuffle their heroine-specific pattern deck.  
  - Draw 3 pattern cards face up in front of them.  
  - Perform any unique setup per heroine abilities.  
- Each player draws 10 bullets into their current supply from the center.  
- Place 3 team action cards into powerup slots (solo mode: skip this step).  

- Select a boss board:  
  - Shuffle the boss pattern deck and place it near the board.  
  - Reveal the top pattern card into the active pattern area.  
  - Place shields on every shield slot except the topmost one.  
  - Perform any unique boss setup effects.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds. Each round has two phases:

### 1. Heroine Round  
**Option Phase:**  
Players take turns performing any of the following in any order:  
- Place bullets onto patterns.  
- Use actions (spend AP to activate abilities).  
- Use patterns (complete a pattern by fulfilling its bullet placement requirements).  
- Use team actions (multiplayer only).  
- Place all cleared bullets (from completed patterns) into the boss’s incoming area.  

**End Phase:**  
- Ensure all bullets are placed.  
- Draw pattern cards up to hand size (normally 3).  

**Cleanup Phase:**  
- Reset all AP markers to the top of the AP track.  

### 2. Boss Round  
**Activate Pattern:**  
- Apply the effect on the active boss pattern card to each heroine who did *not* complete the pattern.  
- Effects are applied directly; no rotating or mirroring of patterns is allowed.  

**Prepare Next Round:**  
- Draw bullets from the center into the current supply equal to the Intensity number shown on the bottommost revealed shield slot.  
- Draw a new boss pattern card and place it face up as the new active pattern.  

**Break Shields:**  
- Compare total bullets in the boss’s incoming area to the break point values on shield slots (from top to bottom).  
- If the total meets or exceeds a shield’s break point, break that shield.  
- Continue checking and breaking shields in order until no more can be broken.  
- If *any* shield was broken:  
  - Return all bullets in the boss’s incoming area to the center.  
- If *no* shields were broken:  
  - Bullets remain in the boss’s incoming area and carry over to the next round.  
- Resolve all effects on newly broken shield slots, in order from top to bottom.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Patterns (Heroine):** Players complete patterns by placing required bullets. Completing a pattern clears those bullets and sends them to the boss’s incoming.  
- **Action Points (AP):** Used to activate special actions. Reset at the end of each heroine round.  
- **Bullets:** Represent damage or energy. Placed by players to complete patterns; accumulate in boss’s incoming to break shields.  
- **Boss Patterns:** Trigger negative effects on heroines who fail to complete them. Changed each round.  
- **Shield Breaking:** Requires sufficient bullets in incoming. Breaking shields removes them and may trigger effects.  
- **Team Actions (Multiplayer only):** Shared actions available in team play, stored in powerup slots.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
There is no scoring system. The game ends immediately when:  
- **Win Condition (Heroines):** The boss has no shields remaining at the end of a boss round (after all steps are completed), *and* all heroines are still alive.  
- **Loss Condition (Heroines):** Any heroine reaches 0 life.  
  - That heroine is removed from the game.  
  - All their bullets return to the center.  
  - Shield break requirements adjust based on the number of remaining heroines.  
- **Boss Win:** All heroines are eliminated.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Shield Break Order:** Shields are broken sequentially from top to bottom. Only one shield is broken at a time, and checks resume after each break.  
- **Carryover Bullets:** If no shield is broken, bullets stay in incoming. They accumulate over rounds.  
- **AP Reset:** AP is fully reset during the Cleanup Phase of the Heroine Round.  
- **Pattern Completion:** A pattern must be fully matched exactly (no rotation/mirroring) to be considered complete.  
- **Simultaneous Effects:** Resolve effects on broken shields in top-down order.  
- **Boss Pattern Effect Timing:** Applied only to heroines who did *not* complete the current boss pattern.
