### 1. Lore & Objective
In the StarCraft universe, three factions—Terran, Zerg, and Protoss—vie for dominance across the galaxy. Players control one of six faction leaders and compete to achieve either a Normal Victory by accumulating 15 conquest points (20 if Aldaris is in play), a Special Victory by fulfilling unique faction-specific objectives during Stage III of the game, or an End-game Victory if two "The End Draws Near" Event cards are played.

Special Victory Conditions:
- **Jim Raynor**: Control at least 6 areas containing minerals and/or gas.
- **Arcturus Mengsk**: Control every area on two different planets.
- **Queen of Blades**: Control at least 3 areas that provide conquest points.
- **Overmind**: Have a base on at least 3 different planets.
- **Tassadar**: Control more areas than each opponent.
- **Aldaris**: Win when two "The End Draws Near" Event cards are played.

### 2. Components
- Faction sheets (with unit build limits, resource costs, and technology access)
- Plastic unit figures (ground and flying)
- Order tokens (standard and special/gold)
- Base, worker, transport, building, and module tokens
- Resource cards (minerals and gas)
- Depletion, guard, and conquest point tokens
- Combat decks (standard and reinforcement cards)
- Technology decks
- Event decks (Stage I, II, III)
- Planet tiles with navigation routes (including Z-Axis routes)
- Conquest point track
- Leadership cards (Stage I, II, III)

### 3. Setup
1. Randomly select the first player and give them the First Player token.
2. Each player chooses a faction and takes its components.
3. Place each faction's conquest point marker at 0 on the track.
4. Prepare the Event deck:
   - Shuffle Stage I, II, and III Event cards separately.
   - Remove cards based on player count:
     - 5 players: 5 from I and II
     - 4 players: 10 from I and II
     - 3 players: 15 from I and II
     - 2 players: 20 from I and II
   - Stack decks: Stage I on top of Stage II on top of Stage III.
5. Each player shuffles their Combat deck and draws 6 cards (8 for Terran players).
6. Each player draws 2 random planet tokens and takes the corresponding planets.
7. First player places a planet; others place clockwise, adjacent to existing planets.
8. After first round, last player places their second planet, continuing counterclockwise.
9. Players place Z-Axis navigation routes starting with the first player.
10. Players take Resource cards corresponding to planets where they placed bases.
11. Starting forces are placed on the base planet (per faction sheet or Leadership card).
12. Players take starting worker tokens and place them in their worker pool.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of three phases:

**1. Planning Phase**
- Players take turns placing one order token (face down) on a planet they control or adjacent to one.
- Special (gold) orders require corresponding R&D modules.
- One Defend Order may be played per phase, placed face up in a friendly area and executed immediately.

**2. Execution Phase**
- Players reveal and execute one order from the top of a planet's stack.
- May choose to draw an Event card instead of executing the order.
- If unable to execute, draw an Event card.
- Special orders are placed in the Special Order Pool if executed; limit based on R&D modules.

**3. Regrouping Phase**
All players perform steps simultaneously:
1. **Destroy Bases & Transports**: Bases with enemy units; transports not connected to friendly base.
2. **Lose Resource Cards**: If no base on planet or area has enemy presence.
3. **Gain Resource Cards**: For each friendly area on planets with a base; take empty areas if sole controller.
4. **Retrieve Workers**: Move all assigned and unavailable workers to the Worker Pool.
5. **Gain Conquest Points**: For each controlled area with conquest points.
6. **Check for Normal Victory**: 15+ (or 20+) conquest points.
7. **Check for Special Victory**: Achieve faction-specific objective in Stage III.
8. **Play Event Cards**: Reveal and play one; discard rest. "The End Draws Near" cards must be played.
9. **Discard Combat Cards**: Down to hand limit (6, 8 for Terran).
10. **Pass First Player Token**: To the left.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Order Execution**
- To "execute" an order, you must perform at least one action:
  - Build: Construct at least one unit, building, or module.
  - Mobilize: Move at least one unit.
  - Research: Draw combat cards and an event card (technology purchase optional).
- If unable or unwilling, draw an event card instead.

**Combat Sequence**
1. Place order token in contested area.
2. Use Start of Battle abilities (attacker first).
3. Draw Combat Cards: Attacker draws 3 (5 if Special Mobilize), Defender draws 1.
4. Attacker establishes skirmishes (front-line pairings).
5. Assign supporting units (attacker first if both have supports).
6. Place Combat Cards (attacker first).
7. Resolve Skirmishes:
   - Reveal cards.
   - Compare attack vs health (include bonuses).
   - Destroy opposing front-line unit if attack ≥ health.
   - Discard cards (except splash damage).
8. Resolve Splash Damage.
9. Resolve Retreats.

**Unit Types and Targeting**
- Units are ground or flying.
- Combat capabilities determine targetability (ground icon, flying icon, both, or neither).
- Supporting units only add support if their front-line unit can target the enemy front-line.

**Cloaking**
- Cloaked units destroyed in skirmish may withdraw to a friendly or empty area on the same planet.
- Withdrawal occurs after "Destroy Units" step.
- Defender withdraws first if both sides must withdraw.
- Does not protect against pre-skirmish destruction (e.g., Charon Boosters).

**Splash Damage**
- Triggered when a combat card with "Splash Damage" keyword destroys at least one opposing unit during skirmish resolution.
- Only triggered by attack value, not by card effects (e.g., Spawn Broodling does not trigger splash).
- Each triggered splash card forces opponent to destroy one surviving unit after battle.

**Collateral Damage**
- If a front-line unit with Collateral Damage survives skirmish resolution, owner may destroy:
  - One enemy base,
  - One enemy installation, or
  - All enemy workers in the area.
- Resolved after all skirmishes in a battle.

**Defensive Module (Brood War)**
- After support assignment, defender may switch two of their units between skirmishes.
- May switch supporting and front-line units within a single skirmish.
- New front-line unit must be targetable by opponent.

**Assist Module (Brood War)**
- One assist unit per area does not count toward unit limit.
- Optional to use.

**Guard Tokens (Brood War)**
- Discard to gain +2 health in each skirmish when defending.
- Cannot stack with other health bonuses (e.g., Hero abilities, Defensive Matrix).
- Player chooses highest applicable bonus.

**Mind Control**
- At end of "Destroy Units" step, if opposing front-line unit survives, it is "stolen."
- Controlled by the player who used Mind Control.
- Uses top card from original owner's Combat deck.
- Mind-controlled non-Protoss units can use reinforcement cards with "Any" keyword.

**Heroes**
- Immune to:
  - Splash damage,
  - Mind control,
  - Technology card abilities that destroy units.
- Can only be destroyed in combat via attack value or forced retreat with no legal destination.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Victory Conditions**
- **Normal Victory**: 15+ conquest points (20+ if Aldaris in play).
- **Special Victory**: Achieve faction-specific objective in Stage III.
- **End-game Victory**: Two or more "The End Draws Near" cards played.
- **Elimination Victory**: Only one player remains with units or bases.

**Game End**
- Game ends immediately if any victory condition is met during Regrouping Phase.

**Tiebreakers**
1. Most conquest points.
2. Most total resources (minerals + gas).
3. Most controlled areas.
4. Most bases.
5. Most workers in pool.
- For Special Victory ties: Most conquest points, then above tiebreakers.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Skirmish with Zero Units**: If a player loses all units to a Start of Battle ability, battle continues. Cards are drawn, retreats resolved, and end-of-battle triggers occur.
- **Infest Command Center**: Cannot be used if no battle occurs (e.g., attacking base with no units). Requires battle to trigger.
- **Strategic Areas (Brood War)**: When controlling a strategic area, all orders on that planet are treated as special orders and do not go into the Special Order Pool.
- **Industrial Strategy**: May only be used once per Regrouping Phase.
- **Versatile Strategy**: If stolen via "Informant," the stealing player may play a second Event card that phase.
- **Maelstrom**: Protoss player decides to use after attacker chooses to move or draw event card.
- **Assist Module**: Allows one assist unit per area to ignore unit limit; applies in multiple areas.
- **Defend Order**: Does not count toward "Start of Battle" ability limit.
- **Retreat Event Card**: Defender retreats all units; attacker loses excess units (if over limit) and their Event card.
