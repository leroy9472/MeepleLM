# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
As the grandmaster of a militaristic order during the Middle Ages, you lead your knights across Europe to defeat enemies, erect buildings, and spread your influence. The game ends when the influence token supply is exhausted. The player with the most Influence Points (IP) wins, representing the order that achieved the greatest legacy before being disbanded by King Philip due to its growing power.

## 2. Components
- 1 double-sided game board (2-player / 3–4-player)
- 4 player boards
- 6 action wedge tiles per player (24 total)
- 12 action tokens per player (48 total)
- 3 knight tokens per player (12 total)
- 16 building tokens per player: 4 castles, 4 churches, 4 farms, 4 banks (64 total)
- 5 troop tokens per player (20 total)
- 2 knight order tiles per player (10 total), choose 1
- 32 enemy tokens: Prussian, Slav, Saracen
- 30 building bonus tiles

- Influence tokens (140 for 2 players, 200 for 3, 260 for 4)

## 3. Setup
### Player Area Setup
1. Each player chooses a color and takes:
   - 1 player board
   - 6 action wedge tiles
   - 12 action tokens (place 2 on each wedge)
   - 3 knight tokens (place 2 on castle row, set 1 aside)
   - 16 buildings (4 of each type on corresponding rows)
   - 5 troop tokens (place in order I–V, yellow banner up)
   - 2 knight order tiles (choose 1, return the other)
2. Randomly arrange one player’s action wedges; all others match that order.
3. Apply knight order setup effects (e.g., Knights of the Holy Sepulchre add 1 token to each Travel wedge).

### Game Board Setup
1. Place board with 2-player side up.
2. Place 1 Prussian and 1 Slav token on the top space of their strength tracks.
3. Shuffle remaining enemy tokens and place one on each flag space. Saracen tokens show building/troop icon face up.
4. Shuffle building bonus tiles face down, then place them face up on matching spaces (all 30 used).
5. Randomly determine start player. In reverse order, each player places their remaining knight on a starting region (no duplicates).
6. Stack enemy majority tiles into 3 piles (Saracen, Prussian, Slav), 1st place on top.
7. Place 140 Influence tokens in supply.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise starting with the first player. On your turn, choose:
- **Resolve an Action**: Use one action wedge.
- **Upgrade a Wedge**: Flip a wedge to its upgraded side.

After resolving or upgrading, distribute action tokens as described below.

### Resolve an Action
1. Choose a wedge with at least 1 action token.
2. Count tokens on the wedge (X). Add bonuses based on action type (e.g., Crusade bonuses from mustered troops).
3. Perform the action.
4. Collect all tokens from the wedge and distribute one per wedge clockwise, starting with the next wedge.

If the wedge is upgraded, you may split tokens between the two actions (at least 1 per action). Resolve one fully before starting the other. Distribute all tokens together after both actions.

### Upgrade a Wedge
1. Set aside tokens on the wedge.
2. Flip wedge to upgraded side.
3. Return tokens.
4. Optionally, distribute tokens from any wedge as normal.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Actions
#### Travel
- Distribute X + bonuses (from castles, churches) as movement points among your knights.
- Move knights between regions with building spaces.
- Leaving a region: 1 point.
- Leaving a region with an enemy: 2 points.
- Knights may move through enemy-occupied regions.

#### Muster
- Cost = level of next unmustered troop.
- Must have X + farm bonuses ≥ cost.
- Collect IP = troop level.
- Flip troop to mustered side (grants +1 to Crusade actions).

#### Crusade
- Choose region with your knight and enemy token.
- Enemy strength: check track (Prussian/Slav) or 6 (Saracen).
- Must have X + bonuses (troops, castles) ≥ enemy strength.
- Defeat enemy:
  - Prussian/Slav: collect IP = strength, advance their strength track +1, keep token.
  - Saracen: choose:
    - Place next building of type shown on token in that region, or flip next troop.
    - Collect IP = building/troop level.
    - Or, collect 3 IP.
  - Keep Saracen token.

#### Influence
- Collect IP = X + bonuses (churches, farms, banks).

#### Build
- Cannot build in region with enemy or existing building.
- Must have knight in region.
- Choose building type. Cost = level of next available building.
- Must have X + bank bonuses + region discounts ≥ cost.
- Place building in central square.
- Collect IP = building level.
- If castle, place unlocked knight (from board) in same region.
- Building bonus tiles grant extra IP for specific building types.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### End Game Trigger
When the last Influence token is taken, finish the current round (all players equal turns). Then score.

### Scoring
#### Enemy Majority Bonuses
For each enemy type (Saracen, Prussian, Slav):
- 1st place: 5 IP (most tokens)
- 2nd place: 2 IP (second most)
- Must have at least 1 token to qualify.
- Tie for 1st: split 5 IP, no 2nd place.
- Tie for 2nd: split 2 IP.

#### Level IV Buildings
- **Castle**: 4 IP per set of 3 different enemy tokens (Saracen, Prussian, Slav).
- **Church**: 6 IP.
- **Farm**: 1 IP per knight on board + 1 per mustered troop.
- **Bank**: 4 IP per level IV building you have (including this one).

Total all IP. Highest score wins.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I resolve an upgraded wedge using only one action?** Yes, assign all tokens to one action (must assign at least 1 to each if doing both).
- **What if I can’t muster due to insufficient X + bonuses?** You cannot muster that troop. Wait until you have enough.
- **Can I build in a region with an enemy if I crusade first?** Yes, crusade to remove enemy, then build later (not in same turn unless via Saracen bonus).
- **Do building bonus tiles affect cost or only IP?** Only IP. Cost reductions are shown on region or via action bonuses.
- **Can multiple players build in the same region?** No. Only one building per region.
- **What happens if influence supply runs out?** Continue collecting; use extra tokens or markers to track overage.
- **Can I upgrade all six wedges?** Yes. After that, you can still "Upgrade a Wedge" to distribute tokens.
