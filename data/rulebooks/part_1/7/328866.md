## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *My Father's Work*, players are Victorian-era mad scientists inheriting their father’s journal and estate. Over three generations, they conduct unethical experiments, upgrade their estate, and navigate public suspicion and personal insanity. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VP) by completing experiments, upgrading the estate, completing the inherited Masterwork, and leveraging journal knowledge.

The game ends after three generations. The player with the most VP wins. Ties are broken first by completion of the Masterwork, then by number of Estate Upgrades.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
A game consists of **3 Generations**, each with **3 Rounds** (Early, Middle, Late). Each round follows this sequence:

#### Start of a Generation
1. Consult the Storybook app.
2. Each player draws one card from A, B, and C Experiment decks (starting hand of 3).
3. Activate Start of Generation abilities and suffer penalties from Estate Upgrades.

#### Start of a Round

#### During a Round
- Players take turns clockwise, beginning with the Start Player.
- On your turn:
  - Place one or more pieces from your Quarters on a single Town or Estate location.
  - Perform the location’s effect immediately.
  - If placing in Town and the location already has any worker (yours or another’s), pay $1.
  - Your Self never pays $1 in Town and performs the action twice (unless marked with No Self Bonus symbol: ×1).
  - Multiple workers of the same type can be placed together for multiple effects.
  - You may only perform one Estate action per turn.
- You may pass at any time. Once all players pass, the round ends.

#### End of a Round
1. Workers on Insanity Track, Record Knowledge, or Perform Experiment become Lost.
2. All other workers return to Quarters.

4. Consult the Storybook app.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Player Pieces
- **Servant (circle base)**: Mainly for Town actions. Cannot perform Estate actions without risk.
- **Spouse (circle base with spikes)**: Functions as Servant; may be targeted by specific effects.
- **Caretaker (square base)**: Can only perform Estate actions. No penalties for Estate actions.
- **Self (hexagon base)**: Can act in Town or Estate. In Town, performs action twice and avoids $1 fee. Cannot use ×1 locations for double effect.

#### Town Actions
- **Resource Gathering**:
  - Park: Chemical
  - Blacksmith: Gear
  - Cemetery: Body
  - Farmer’s Market: Animal
  - Traveling Caravan/Library: Knowledge (Chemistry, Biology, Engineering, Occult)

- **Builder’s Office**: Pay $ cost to buy an Estate Upgrade. Place on next available Estate plot (left to right). Resolve penalties immediately. Slide and refill display after purchase.

#### Estate Actions
- **Estate Affairs**: Draw 3 Experiment cards (any decks), keep 1, discard 2. Or gain $1 instead.
- **Record Knowledge**: Pay required Knowledge cubes to advance one Journal Track one space. Gain 1 free Knowledge of that type per space advanced. Unlock abilities at levels 2 and 3:
  - Chemistry: Gain 1 Servant from Lost at Start of Generation.
  - Biology: Store 2 Resources at End of Generation.
  - Engineering: Counts as a completed B Experiment when building Experiment Pyramid.
  - Occult: Free Occult Knowledge is wild but incurs Start of Generation penalties.
- **Vanity Estate Upgrades**: When reaching level 3 on any Journal Track, immediately build one Vanity Upgrade (pay plot cost if needed).
- **Perform Experiment**: Place Self, Caretaker, or 2 Servants. Pay costs (Ingredients, Knowledge, Experiment levels). Complete card: gain rewards (VP, Resources, etc.), suffer penalties (Insanity, Creepy, Angry Mob). Stored Experiments and Journal levels count toward level requirements.

#### Experiment Levels
- **A**: Cost = Ingredients only. Always provides Knowledge.
- **B**: Cost = Ingredients + Knowledge + 1 completed A.
- **C**: Cost = Ingredients + Knowledge + 1 A + 2 B.
- **Masterwork (D)**: Cost = Ingredients + Knowledge + 1 A + 2 B + 3 C.

#### Tracks
- **Angry Mob / Creepy Track**:
  - Shared track. Suspicion Marker sets max Angry Mob position.
  - Angry Mob moves left when angered; Creepy moves right when performing creepy actions.
  - If Angry Mob overtakes your Creepy marker, you cannot perform Town actions (except Church).
  - Church allows movement backward on Creepy track.
- **Insanity Track**:
  - Individual. Moving right grants bonuses/penalties per space.
  - Landing on a space with a Compulsion card: draw one (keep secret).
