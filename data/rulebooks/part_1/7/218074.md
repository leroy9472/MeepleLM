## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Detective: City of Angels is set in 1940s Los Angeles, where players assume the role of LAPD homicide detectives investigating complex crime stories. The objective is to solve the case by correctly identifying the culprit (Suspect), murder weapon (Weapon), and motive (Motive). In Sleuth Mode, the player acts alone using a paragraph-based system to interrogate suspects and uncover evidence, aiming to solve the mystery before time runs out.

### 2. Components
- City Board (map of Los Angeles divided into five districts)
- Detective Board (Sleuth/Head-to-Head side)
- Detective Miniature
- Action Cubes (4)
- Leverage Markers
- Stress Markers (3)
- Final Guess Marker
- Day Marker
- Case Cards (placed along the top of the City board)
- Suspect Standees and Bases
- Sleuth Casebook (contains numbered paragraphs for responses)
- Detective Casebook (contains case briefings)
- Investigation Sheet (for note-taking)
- Sleuth Card (double-sided, case-specific)

*Note: Components like Scratch tokens, Solve tokens, Bribe-a-Snitch tokens, Knowledge markers, Evidence Removed cards, and markers are not used in Sleuth Mode and should be returned to the box.*

### 3. Setup
1. Place the City board on the table. Position the Day marker on Day 12 and the Final Guess Marker on the Final Guess space.
2. Place your Detective board with the Sleuth/Head-to-Head side up. Put your 4 Action cubes in the Available spaces, choose a Detective miniature, and place your Leverage markers nearby.
3. Place the three Stress markers on your Detective board with their grayed-out side faceup.
4. Take the Sleuth casebook, Detective casebook, and an Investigation sheet; place them within reach. Set the Chisel casebook aside.
5. Choose a case (e.g., Blood on the Pier for first-time players). Remove all cards from the case’s tuckbox.
6. Return Response cards and Search cards to the tuckbox without looking at them.
7. Place Case cards facedown along the top of the City board in their designated spaces.
8. Place the case’s double-sided Sleuth card next to your Detective board.
9. Place the punchboard with Suspect standees next to the City board.
10. Read the case briefing in the Detective casebook. As instructed:
   - Flip specified Case cards faceup.
   - Place the Crime Scene marker.
   - Punch out and place Suspect standees as directed.
11. Fill out your Investigation sheet with known suspects and Case card information.
12. Follow any Special Rules (e.g., adjusting starting Day marker).
13. Place your Detective miniature at any Police Station location.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Each turn represents one day. The detective has 4 actions per day.
- Actions may be taken in any order and repeated.
- After using actions, move the Day marker down one space.
- The game ends when:
  - The detective successfully solves the case.
  - The Final Guess is reached and the case remains unsolved (Case Goes Cold).

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Actions (choose up to 4 per day):**
- **Move**: Move anywhere within your current district. Locations on borders count for both districts. Any location can be reached in 3 or fewer moves.
- **Search Location**: Search your current location. Consult the Search grid on the Sleuth card to find the corresponding paragraph number in the Sleuth casebook. Read and follow instructions. These responses are always truthful; no challenge allowed.
- **Search Suspect**: Search a suspect at your current location. Use the Search grid to find the paragraph number in the Sleuth casebook. Read and follow instructions. Responses are always truthful; no challenge allowed.
- **Question Suspect**: Ask a suspect about a Case card you have knowledge of. Use the Question grid on the Sleuth card to find the paragraph number. Read the response. You may then choose to challenge the answer.

**Discovering New Elements:**
- **New Case Cards**: Discovered via searches or questions. Mark on Investigation sheet. Knowledge is tracked via notes.
- **New Suspects**: Revealed when searching locations. Flip suspect’s Case card faceup, place standee, and immediately ask one free question (no action cost).

**Challenging a Question:**
- After reading a suspect’s response, you may challenge if you believe it is a lie.
- Mark the challenge on your Investigation sheet.
- Turn to the indicated challenge paragraph in the Sleuth casebook.
  - **Successful Challenge**: Gain 1 Leverage over the suspect. Place Leverage marker beneath suspect’s Case card.
  - **Unsuccessful Challenge**: Gain 1 Stress (flip a Stress marker to colored side).
- After challenging a specific question, you cannot ask it again.

**Stress System:**
- Receiving a third Stress flips all Stress markers back to gray and moves the Final Guess Marker up one space (reducing time to solve).
- Stress does not reset between Overtime periods.

**Leverage:**
- Spend 1 Leverage over a suspect **before** reading the initial response paragraph.
- After spending, read the initial paragraph, then immediately read the challenge paragraph, ignoring any instruction to gain Leverage or Stress.
- Leverage grants the most useful response and blocks other players from bribing (not applicable in solo play).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Winning**: Solve the case by making a correct Final Guess.
- **Final Guess**: Triggered when the Day marker reaches the Final Guess Marker.
  1. Write down your guess: Suspect (with Case card letter), Weapon (with Case card letter), Motive.
  2. Assign numbers using the chart on the back of the Sleuth casebook.
  3. Add numbers to get a paragraph number.
  4. Turn to that paragraph:
     - If it begins with “The Captain calls you into his office to congratulate you…” and names your case, you solved it.
     - Otherwise, the guess is incorrect.
- **Overtime**:
  - **First Overtime**: 3 extra days. Day marker set to Day 3, Final Guess Marker reset.
  - **Second Overtime**: Another 3 days if first guess fails.
  - After three incorrect guesses, the Case Goes Cold (loss).
- **Final Rating**:
  - Solved within first 12 days: Hard Sleuth
  - First Overtime: Wisehead
  - Second Overtime: Palooka
  - Case Goes Cold: A Sap, Rube, 'n Boob

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I search a location with no Search card?**  
  Yes. Use the “All Other Locations” entry on the Search grid.
- **Can I question a suspect about a card I haven’t seen?**  
  No. You must have knowledge of the Case card (seen it or it’s faceup).
- **Can I challenge after using Leverage?**  
  No. You still read the challenge paragraph, but ignore gain instructions.
- **What if I challenge and get the same response?**  
  The suspect was telling the truth. You gain Stress.
- **Can I ask the same question after a failed challenge?**  
  No. Once challenged, the question is locked.
- **What happens if I run out of Leverage?**  
  You simply cannot spend it until you earn more via successful challenges.
- **Do I reset Stress after Overtime?**  
  No. Carry over Stress into Overtime periods.
