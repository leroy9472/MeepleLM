## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Etherfields is a narrative-driven, campaign-based board game where players take on the roles of Dreamers navigating surreal, ever-changing dreamscapes. The overarching goal is to progress through a series of Dreams by first exploring the DreamWORLD — a persistent overworld map — and then entering Dreamscape phases to complete specific objectives. Success in these Dreams unlocks new areas, items, and story content, advancing the campaign.

The immediate objective in each full game cycle is to:
- Traverse the DreamWORLD map.
- Trigger and survive Slumbers (encounters with dream entities).
- Collect Keys to meet entry conditions for Dream Gate tiles.
- Enter a Dream via a Dream Gate, complete its goal in the Dreamscape phase, and return to continue the campaign.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game alternates between two major phases:

#### A. DreamWORLD Phase  
**Objective**: Move across the DreamWORLD map, draw Fate/Slumber cards, collect Keys, and prepare for the next Dream.

1. **Choose Next Dream Gate**:

2. **Traverse DreamWORLD**:
   - Move Team mini between connected locations.
   - At certain spaces, draw:
     - **Fate Cards**: May place a Slumber Map Tile, apply Quirks, or trigger events.
     - **Slumber Cards**: If drawn at Slumber location, resolve:
       - Spawn an Entity (e.g., Wraith) → Enter Dreamscape.
       - Option to Skip (consequences per s.770) or Enter Slumber.
       - Delta Phase card may appear, introducing new mechanics.
3. **Encounter Slumber**:
   - Take top tile from **Slumber Map Deck**.

   - Defeat or resolve Entity within 4 turns.
   - Chase out Wraith (if applicable) to gain loot.
   - Return Slumber Map Tiles to deck after phase ends.
5. **Prepare for Dream**:

### 5. Core Mechanics

- **Ether**: Currency used to buy Items or Influence cards at Shops.
- **Distress**: Negative status; accumulates during failed actions or entity encounters.
- **Shining Gems**: Special resource; usage depends on Dream.
- **Turn Tracking**: Turn Cards manage phase order and escalating difficulty.
- **Entity Behavior**: Entities (e.g., Wraiths) spawn during Slumbers; must be dealt with in Dreamscape.
- **Quirks**: Temporary modifiers applied during Slumbers or Dreams; remain until resolved.
- **Clock Mechanic**: Players can use the Clock (resource) for extra moves or safety when time-constrained.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **No traditional scoring system**.
- Victory is measured by **campaign progression**:
  - Completing Dreams.
  - Unlocking new Dream Gate tiles.
  - Advancing narrative via Secret Scripts.
- **Game ends** when the final Dream in the campaign is completed (not detailed in provided files).
- Success is binary per Dream: complete goal or fail (based on Turn exhaustion, death, or unmet conditions).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use Deliverance during early Slumbers?**  
  No — per source, “I don't believe you can use the Deliverance Secret Scripts reference in the bottom right at this time.”

- **What happens if I can’t place a Slumber Map Tile?**  
  If no valid space, follow Fate card instruction; otherwise, tile placement may be offset but must align coordinate symbols.

- **How to save mid-session?**  
  Stack components as follows: hand (face-up), deck (face-down), discard (face-up), sealed (face-down), active mask (face-up), tokens with Ether. Note DreamWORLD location and Dreamscape state. Reconstruct when resuming.

- **Do I reshuffle the Influence Deck before first play?**  
  Not required initially, but acceptable if already done.

- **What if I miss an action on the Dreamscape?**  
  It’s acceptable. The game will not block progress for non-critical missed actions.

- **Where do Wisdom Cards go?**  
  Place in 9-slot sleeve for ongoing reference.

- **How are Slumber Decks organized?**  
  - Slumber Deck (tiles II-37 A-D): A (different back) on bottom, others shuffled on top.
  - Slumber Map Deck: Starting tiles face-up on B2/B3; rest face-down in slot.
