### 1. Lore & Objective
The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Rune Lords is an adventure path set in the region of Varisia. Ancient evils tied to the fallen Thassilonian Empire are stirring, threatening towns like Sandpoint. Players take on the roles of heroes who must confront goblins, cultists, ogres, stone giants, and ultimately the reawakening Runelord of Greed, Karzoug. The objective across the adventure path is to defeat the villains and henchmen at the heart of each threat, close locations, and ultimately save the region from destruction.

### 2. Components
The game uses various card types:
- **Adventures**: Sequences of scenarios (e.g., Burnt Offerings, Skinsaw Murders).
- **Scenarios**: Individual game sessions with a specific goal, villain, and set of locations.
- **Locations**: Cards representing places in the world, each with a deck of cards to explore.
- **Villains & Henchmen**: Monster cards that players must defeat.
- **Boons**: Cards players can acquire, including Weapons, Spells, Armor, Items, Allies, and Blessings.
- **Blessings Deck**: A central deck that is advanced each turn; if it runs out, the players lose the scenario.

### 3. Setup
1. **Choose an Adventure**: The Rise of the Rune Lords Adventure Path is played in a specific order: Burnt Offerings, The Skinsaw Murders, The Hook Mountain Massacre, Fortress of the Stone Giants, Sins of the Savior, and Spires of Xin-Shalast.
2. **Select a Scenario**: Each adventure consists of 5-6 scenarios played in a set order (e.g., Attack on Sandpoint, then Local Heroes).
3. **Prepare the Scenario**:
    - Place the Scenario card in the center.
    - Set up the Blessings Deck (typically 25 cards for most scenarios).
    - Select the required Location cards (number and type depend on player count) and shuffle their decks.
    - Shuffle the required Villain and Henchmen cards into the location decks as specified.
4. **Prepare Characters**: Each player chooses a character (e.g., Valeros, Ezren), builds their starting deck according to their character card, and draws a starting hand.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On a player's turn, they perform the following steps in order:
1. **Advance the Blessings Deck**: Flip the top card of the Blessings Deck to the discard pile. If the deck is empty, the players lose.
2. **Give a Card** (Optional): Give a card from their hand to another character at the same location.
3. **Move** (Optional): Move their character to another location, triggering any movement effects.
4. **Explore** (Optional): Explore the top card of their current location's deck once per turn. This involves:
    - Flipping the card over.
    - Optionally evading it.
    - Resolving the encounter (attempting to acquire a boon or defeat a bane).
    - Applying any effects that happen after the encounter.
5. **Try to Close a Location** (Optional): If a location has no cards in its deck, a player may attempt to close it by succeeding at a check or fulfilling a requirement.
6. **Reset Hand**: Discard down to or draw up to their hand size.
7. **End Turn**: Pass the turn to the next player.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Encountering Cards**:
    - **Boons**: Attempt a "Check to Acquire" using the listed skill(s). If successful, add the card to your hand; if you fail, banish it.
    - **Banes (Monsters, Barriers, Villains, Henchmen)**: Must attempt a "Check to Defeat." If you fail, the bane is undefeated and shuffled back into the deck, and you take damage (discard cards from your hand equal to the difference between the check difficulty and your roll).
- **Closing Locations**:
    - **Temporarily Close**: Can be done during a villain encounter to prevent it from escaping there. Only requires fulfilling the "When Closing" requirement.
    - **Permanently Close**: Done when a location deck is empty. Requires fulfilling the "When Closing" requirement and triggers the "When Permanently Closed" effect.
- **Defeating a Villain**: After defeating a villain, you must close its location. You then examine the location deck. If there are no other villains, banish all cards and the location is permanently closed. If other villains remain, the location is only temporarily closed, and the defeated villain cannot escape there.
- **Winning the Scenario**: The victory condition is defined on the Scenario card. Common goals include defeating a specific villain, closing all locations, or collecting a certain number of allies.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Rewards**: Upon winning a scenario, each character gains a reward as specified (e.g., a card feat, a skill feat, a power feat, or a random card of a specific type).
- **Losing**: The players lose if they cannot advance the Blessings Deck (i.e., it is empty) or if all characters die.
- **Dying**: A character dies if they are ever required to draw a card from their deck and cannot. Their deck, hand, and discard pile are buried (put in the box). The game continues until all characters are dead.
- **Between Scenarios**: Players keep their character decks and any cards they acquired. They replay failed scenarios until successful before moving to the next.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Multiple Checks**: If a bane requires multiple checks (e.g., Combat 17 or Fortitude 12 then Combat 21), you must attempt both sequentially, even if you fail the first.
- **Player Choice**: The player who encounters a card must be the one to resolve it. Other players can help by playing cards, but they cannot make the checks for you.
- **Card Effects**: Cards do exactly what they say and nothing more. If a card says it works on "your check," it only works on your own check, not another player's.
- **Impossible Actions**: If a card instructs you to do something impossible (e.g., examine a card from an empty deck), ignore that part of the instruction.
- **Summoning**: Summoned cards are retrieved from the box and banished after the encounter. They do not come from or return to location decks.
