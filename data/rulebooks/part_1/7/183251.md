## Karuba — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Karuba, players lead expeditions of four adventurers each to navigate a dense jungle island in search of ancient temples. The goal is to guide adventurers from the beach to their matching-colored temples while collecting gold nuggets and crystals along the way. Victory is achieved by earning the most victory points through temple treasures, gold, and crystals.

2. Components  
- 4 island boards (one per player)  
- 16 adventurers (4 each in brown, blue, purple, yellow)  
- 16 temples (4 each in brown, blue, purple, yellow)  
- 144 jungle tiles (4 sets of 36 tiles, numbered 1–36; backs are color-coded but functionally identical)  
- 16 temple treasures: 4 stacks of values (2, 3, 4, 5) in each of the 4 colors  
- 12 gold nuggets (worth 2 VP each)  
- 64 crystals (worth 1 VP each)

3. Setup  
- Each player takes 1 island, 4 adventurers, 4 temples, and 1 set of 36 jungle tiles.  
- Prepare temple treasure stacks based on player count:  
  - 2 players: 5, 3  
  - 3 players: 5, 3, 2  
  - 4 players: 5, 4, 3, 2  
- Create 4 face-up stacks (by color), sorted with highest value on top. Place in center.  
- Place gold and crystals in center within reach.  
- All players cooperatively place adventurers and temples:  
  - One player places an adventurer on a beach number and its matching-colored temple on a jungle number.  
  - Minimum distance: 3 spaces between adventurer and temple of same color.  
  - All other players replicate this placement on their boards.  
  - Repeat until all 4 colors are placed.  
- Randomly choose starting player ("expedition leader").  
  - They shuffle their jungle tiles and place them face-down.  
  - All other players sort their tiles by number and place them face-up.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- The expedition leader reveals the top tile and calls out its number.  
- All players simultaneously locate the tile with that number in their set.  
- Each player chooses one of two actions:  
  A. **Place Tile**: Lay the tile on any empty space of their island.  
    - Number must be in upper-left corner.  
    - Tile need not connect to other tiles.  
    - If tile has gold/crystal symbol, all players take one from supply and place it on the tile.  
  B. **Discard Tile & Move Adventurer**:  
    - Move one adventurer up to as many steps as the number of paths on the tile’s edge (2, 3, or 4).  
    - Movement must follow connected paths; no leaping over tiles or multiple adventurers per tile.  
    - Movement points cannot be split between adventurers.  
- After all players resolve their action, repeat with next tile.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Tile Placement**: Tiles may be placed anywhere, even isolated. Paths may dead-end.  
- **Movement**:  
  - Only one adventurer per tile.  
  - Adventurers may turn at intersections.  
  - Movement ends when steps are used or adventurer reaches destination.  
- **Collecting Treasures**:  
  - To collect gold or crystal: end movement on a tile containing one. Take it and place it on the adventurer’s portrait.  
  - Passing by does not allow collection.  
- **Reaching a Temple**:  
  - If an adventurer ends movement on the temple space of matching color:  
    - Take the top remaining treasure of that color.  
    - Leave adventurer on temple; it cannot move again.  
  - If multiple players reach same-color temple in same turn:  
    - First player takes top treasure.  
    - Subsequent players take next available treasure of that color.  
    - If lower value, they take crystals to make up the difference (e.g., 3-point treasure + 1 crystal = 4 points if top was 4).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when:  
  - The last of the 36 tiles is revealed by the expedition leader, OR  
  - Any one player has all 4 adventurers reach their temples.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - Temple treasures: printed value  
  - Gold nuggets: 2 VP each  
  - Crystals: 1 VP each  
  - Unclaimed gold/crystals on tiles are not scored.  
- **Tiebreaker**:  
  - Player with most jungle tiles placed wins.  
  - If still tied, players are joint winners.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can tiles be rotated?  
  A: No. Number must always be in upper-left corner.  
- Q: Can I place a tile that blocks my adventurer?  
  A: Yes, but not advised. Be cautious of dead-ends.  
- Q: Can I move an adventurer already at a temple?  
  A: No. Once at a temple, it remains there.  
- Q: Can I discard a tile but not use all movement points?  
  A: Yes. Movement points may be forfeited.  
- Q: What if I can’t find the called tile?  
  A: All players have identical sets. You must have it—search carefully.
