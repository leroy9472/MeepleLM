### 1. Lore & Objective
Cooper Island is a strategy game where players explore and develop their own peninsula on a shared island. The goal is to earn the most points over 5 rounds by expanding territory, building structures, fulfilling orders, and gaining helm points through actions and movement of ships around the island. Victory is determined by final scoring, with ties broken by the player who has fewer uncharted spaces on their peninsula.

  - 3 players: Use A, B, C; 3 peninsula and bay tiles.
  - 2 players: Use A, B, C, D; 2 peninsula and bay tiles.

- Place royal order cards:
  - 4p: All 8 cards.
  - 3p: 6 random cards.
  - 2p: 4 random cards (remove card #8).
- Shuffle small and large building decks; place beside board.

**Player Setup:**

- Places 1 crate lid of their color on each of the 5 cargo ship cards.
- Takes player board, worker board, buildings (2 small, 2 large, 1 fortress), and places them on designated spots.
- Places cartographer marker on 0 of track.
- Places 2 normal workers in available workers area; 2 normal below on round spaces; 2 special on square spaces.
- Places 4 milestone tokens face-up on milestone spaces (any order).
- Places 5 ruin tokens (ruin side up) on ruin spaces of their peninsula.
- Places 1-sail ship (clockwise) and 2-sail ship (counter-clockwise) on harbor space.
- Places 6 income boat tokens and 6 islet tiles in personal reserve.
- Places 1 meadow tile on start space of peninsula with 1 food cube on it.
- Takes 1 coin and places it on any storage spot.
- Starting player and left neighbor place cartographer on 3; others on 4.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 5 rounds. Each round has three phases:

**a) Income Phase (simultaneous):**
Players perform income actions in any order:
- Place 1 islet tile from reserve onto peninsula:
  - Landscape hex must be uncharted, adjacent to existing landscape, not on ruin.
  - Islet side covers 1/2 sand bank (other half visible).
  - First islet must go to right of harbor.
  - Place matching resource cube; perform islet action once (or forfeit).
- Place 1 double landscape tile from reserve:
  - Can place on 2 uncharted hexes (at least one adjacent to existing landscape, neither occupied by ruin).
  - Or stack on 2 existing matching landscape tiles (same height, empty).
  - Settlements can go on any landscape.
  - Can use cartographer action to "shim" one hex up by 1 level.
  - Place resource cubes. Mountain level 3+ can produce stone or gold (player choice).

**b) Worker Phase (turn order):**
- Player with Cooper token starts.
- On turn, place 1 worker from available area to a worker space (shape must match: round or square).
- If placing on another player’s worker stack, pay 1 coin or 1 resource cube (from storage or landscape) to that player’s marketplace.
  - If unable/unwilling, opponent takes 1 coin/cube from supply; you place 1 anchor token under a sail ship (evenly distributed).
- Only the first player to cover a bonus symbol gets to use it.
- Perform action(s) immediately. Special workers have enhanced abilities.

**c) Clean-up Phase (simultaneous):**
All players perform 7 steps together:
1. **Feed Workers:** Pay food cubes ≥ total feeding value on feeding row.
   - For each missing food, place 1 anchor under a sail ship (distribute evenly).
   - If fully fed, gain 1 helm point for each uncovered rightmost feeding value.
2. **Reactivate Assets:** May do one:
   - Pay 2 coins to flip 1 face-down large building card.
   - Pay 1 coin to return 1 used crate lid to unused area.
   - If fortress built, can do both for free.
3. **Gain Statue Bonus:** 1 helm point per statue on peninsula.
4. **Gain Passage Bonus:** 1 helm point if all 3 top peninsula spaces are covered.
5. **Return Workers:** Return all workers to available area.
6. **Clear Marketplace:** Return leftover coins/resources to supply.
7. **Move Harbormaster:** Stand upright and move to next cargo ship. Game ends after moving from last ship.

### 5. Core Mechanics

**Milestones:**
When you achieve:
- 2 income boats on landing spaces
- 2 buildings on peninsula
- 2 statues on peninsula
- 2 crate lids acquired from cargo ships  
Flip milestone token face down. Later, move it to a hire space to gain reward:
- +2 helm points
- Move 1 worker from below to available area:
  - If normal: just gain worker.
  - If special: must assign 1 available worker to a free royal order card (can be the new one if no others available).
  - Increases feeding cost; may grant helm points if fully fed.

**Gaining Helm Points:**
- Must assign all points from one action to a single ship.
- Move ship that many steps (clockwise for 1-sail, counter-clockwise for 2-sail).
- Passing islet: perform its action immediately.
- Reaching bay: gain log book token, perform action (or forfeit), place token in front of you.
- Reaching harbor: gain log book token, perform action, then pay 1 coin/resource:
  - To opponent if their harbor (to their marketplace)
  - To supply if your own
  - If not paid, take 1 anchor; opponent (if theirs) takes 1 coin/resource from supply.
- Ships with anchors cannot move until anchors are removed (1 helm point per anchor).
- Multiple ships can occupy same space.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after clean-up phase of round 5.

**Final Scoring:**
1. **Helm Points:**
   - Log book tokens: 5 points each.
   - Spaces each ship is past last harbor or bay: 1 point per space.
2. **Royal Order Cards:** Score based on level achieved (not cumulative). If you have a worker on a card, score as normal. If not, may copy another player’s card (reduction of 1 point; 0 if below first stage).
3. **Building Cards:** Gain points for face-up cards with fulfilled tasks.
4. **Leftovers:** Combine coins/resources in storage, cartographer steps, and double landscape tiles in reserve. Divide by 5, round down → points.
5. **Anchor Tokens:** −1 point each.

**Winning:**
- Most points wins.
- Tie: player with fewer uncharted spaces on peninsula wins. If still tied, shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Building Placement:** Must be on highest available space. Can clear space via anytime actions.
- **Special Worker Assignment:** When gaining special worker via hire, must assign a worker (possibly itself) to royal order card.
