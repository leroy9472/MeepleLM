## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Dinosaur Island: Rawr ’N Write*, players compete to build the most successful dinosaur-themed park. The goal is to attract visitors, create thrilling dinosaur exhibits, and manage security threats. Players collect DNA to clone dinosaurs, construct attractions, hire specialists, and develop infrastructure—all while managing the inherent dangers of escaped dinosaurs and park disasters. Victory is determined at the end of three seasons by scoring Victory Points (VP) based on dinosaurs, buildings, specialists, excitement, and objectives.
