## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players control robots racing across a dangerous factory floor to touch numbered flags in sequence. The first robot to touch all flags in order wins. Robots must navigate hazards, avoid destruction, and outmaneuver opponents through simultaneous programming.

### 2. Components  
- Factory Floor boards (including Docking Bay)  
- Robot figures  
- Program sheets (one per robot)  
- Archive markers (one per robot)  
- Program cards (movement instructions)  
- Option cards  
- Damage tokens  
- Life tokens (3 or 4 per player)  
- Power Down tokens  
- Flags (checkpoints)  
- Board elements: conveyor belts, lasers, pits, repair sites, pushers, gears, etc.

### 3. Setup  
1. Assemble the course using Factory Floor boards as per chosen layout. Place flags in numbered order.  
2. Each player selects:  
   - A robot figure  
   - Matching Archive marker  
   - Program sheet  
3. Place 3 life tokens on each Program sheet (4 if 5+ players).  
4. Place Damage tokens, Power Down tokens, and Factory Floor Guides near the board.  
5. Shuffle Program and Option decks; place face down beside the board.  
6. Determine starting player. Players place robots and Archive markers on Docking Bay spaces #1, #2, etc., in clockwise order, with robots facing the main board.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn consists of five phases repeated over 5 registers:

1. **Programming Phase**  
   - Deal Program cards (9 minus 1 per Damage token)  
   - Players secretly assign 5 cards to registers #1–#5  
   - Announce Power Down (takes effect next turn)  

2. **Register Phases (1–5)** – Repeat for each register:  
   a. **Reveal Program Cards**: All players reveal register card simultaneously.  
   b. **Robots Move**: In priority order (highest card number first), execute movement. Colliding robots push each other.  
   c. **Board Elements Move**:  
      - Express conveyor belts move 1 space  
      - Express + normal conveyor belts move 1 space  
      - Currents move 1 space  
      - Pushers push if active  
      - Gears rotate 90°  
      - Crushers activate if applicable  
   d. **Resolve Lasers & Events**:  
      - Board and robot lasers fire – 1 damage to first robot in line of sight  
      - Flamers, radioactive waste, and other hazards deal damage  
   e. **Touch Checkpoints**:  
      - Robots on flags or repair sites place Archive markers  
      - Flags touched count toward victory  

3. **Cleanup Phase** (after Register 5):  
   - Repair: Robots on wrench spaces discard 1 Damage token  
   - Robots on wrench+hammer spaces discard 1 Damage token and draw 1 Option card  
   - Discard Program cards from unlocked registers  
   - Powered down robots: announce whether to remain powered down  
   - Destroyed robots re-enter on Archive marker with 2 Damage tokens (player chooses orientation)  
   - Locked registers persist until damage is repaired  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Programming & Movement  
- Each player is dealt 9 Program cards, minus 1 per Damage token  
- Choose 5 cards to program into registers #1 to #5 (left to right)  
- Cards are executed in register order (1 → 5)  
- Movement priority: higher-numbered cards move first within each register  
- Robots push others when colliding; cannot move through walls  

#### Locked Registers  
- At 5+ Damage: Register #5 locks  
- 6 Damage: Registers #4–5 lock  
- 7 Damage: Registers #3–5 lock  
- 8 Damage: Registers #2–5 lock  
- 9+ Damage: All registers lock  
- Locked cards remain in place and re-execute until damage is repaired  
- Repair must unlock registers in reverse order (#1 first, then #2, etc.)  

#### Powering Down  
- Announced during programming phase; takes effect next turn  
- At start of turn: remove all Damage tokens  
- Robot does not move or execute Program cards  
- Still affected by board elements (e.g., conveyor belts move it)  
- May choose to remain powered down  

#### Destruction  
A robot is destroyed if:  
- Receives 10th Damage token  
- Moves into a pit, drain, or off the board  
- Crushed by active crusher  

When destroyed:  
- Discard 1 Option card (player’s choice)  
- Discard 1 Life token  
- Robot re-enters on last touched flag (Archive marker) with 2 Damage tokens  
- Final Life token lost = elimination from game  

#### Board Elements  
- **Conveyor Belts**: Move robots 1 space; turning belts rotate robots  
- **Pits/Drains**: Destroy robot on contact  
- **Lasers**: Deal 1 damage to first robot in line of sight  
- **Flamers**: Deal 1 damage when entered or occupied during activation phase  
- **Pushers**: Push robots 1 space when active  
- **Gears**: Rotate robot 90°  
- **Repair Sites**:  
  - Single wrench: repair 1 Damage  
  - Wrench+hammer: repair 1 Damage + draw 1 Option card  
- **Radioactive Waste**: 1 Damage + draw 1 Option card  
- **Chop Shops**: Choose one:  
  - Discard Option card and draw new one  
  - Replenish ammunition for an equipped Option  
  - Draw Option card (if none held)  

#### Virtual Robots  
- Destroyed robots re-enter as virtual robots  
- Do not interact with other robots (no pushing, no laser fire)  
- Interact with all board elements  
- Materialize when alone on a space  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Victory condition: First robot to touch all flags in numerical order  
- Touching a flag places Archive marker and counts toward victory  
- Game ends immediately when a player touches the final flag  
- Optional: Continue play to determine runners-up  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Simultaneous Movement**: All cards revealed at once; movement resolved by priority  
- **Ties in Priority**: No tiebreaker – cards with same number move in player order (Dock # order)  
- **Timer Rule**: When only one player remains programming, start 30-second timer. If time runs out, left neighbor randomly fills remaining registers  
- **Option Cards to Prevent Damage**: May discard Option card(s) at time of damage to avoid receiving Damage token (1 card per 1 damage)  
- **Reprogramming Locked Registers**: Cannot change locked cards; must repair damage to unlock  
- **Robot on Multiple Hazards**: Resolve in phase order: movement → board elements → lasers → end-of-phase effects  
- **Teleporters**: Robot executing movement on teleporter moves forward (movement value +2) from matching colored exit  
- **Portals**: Robot entering one portal immediately moves to matching portal unless occupied
