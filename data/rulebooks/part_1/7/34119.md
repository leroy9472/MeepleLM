# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In *Tales of the Arabian Nights*, players become heroes or heroines in an epic story inspired by the classic tales told by Scheherazade. You travel across a magical and dangerous world filled with wonders, perils, and legendary beings. Your goal is to fulfill a personal destiny by collecting a secret combination of Destiny Points and Story Points, then return to Baghdad to win.

The true joy of the game lies in experiencing and narrating a unique, unfolding story—each playthrough is a new adventure.

**Win Condition**: Be the first to meet your secret goal (summing to 20 points between Destiny and Story Points) and return safely to Baghdad.

## 2. Components
- 1 mounted game map
- 1 Book of Tales (paragraph-based story outcomes)
- 1 Reaction Matrix booklet
- 1 deck of Encounter cards (Character, Terrain, and City types)
- 1 deck of Treasure cards
- 1 deck of Status cards
- 1 deck of Quest cards
- 6 Player References
- 6 Character stand-ups with stands
- 1 special Destiny Die (faces: +, –, blank)
- 2 standard six-sided dice
- 3 sets of player markers (each set includes: Identity, Wealth, Origin, Destination, Quest, Story, and Destiny markers)

## 3. Setup
1. Each player chooses a character and matching color set of markers.
2. Place your Character in Baghdad.
3. Place your Destiny and Story Point markers on the "1" space of their respective tracks.
4. Place your Wealth marker on "Poor".
5. Shuffle and deal 1 Quest card face-up to each player. Place the rest face-down near the board.
6. Shuffle the Encounter deck and place it beside the board with the "Morning" marker.
7. Shuffle the Treasure deck and place it face-down nearby.
8. Sort Status cards by type and place them face-up near the board.
9. **Set Victory Goal**: Each player secretly decides how many Destiny and Story Points they need to win, as long as the total is exactly 20. Conceal these tokens under your Player Reference.
10. Roll two dice; highest roller goes first (ties re-rolled).
11. **Choose Skills**: In turn order, each player selects one Skill marker three times (no duplicates). All start at Talent level (Talent side up).

## 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn, follow these phases in order:

1. **Pass the Book of Tales**  
   - Give the Book of Tales to the player on your left (Reader).  
   - Give the Reaction Matrix to the player on your right (Matrix Reader).  
   - In 2-player games, one player handles both.

2. **Check Treasures and Statuses**  
   - Announce any active effects from your treasures or statuses.

3. **Move Your Character**  
   - Move up to your land or sea movement rate (based on Wealth Level).  
   - Combined movement cannot exceed the higher of the two rates.  
   - No more than the slower rate may be used on that terrain type.  
   - Example: Princely wealth = 5 sea / 3 land → max 5 spaces, max 3 by land.

4. **Resolve Your Encounter**  
   - Draw the top Encounter card (unless in a Place of Power).  
   - Follow the card type (Character, Terrain, or City) to determine the paragraph or matrix.
   - Use the Encounter Chart, Reaction Matrix, and Destiny Die to resolve the encounter.

5. **Play Cards and Resolve Quests**  
   - If in a city, you may play a matching City Encounter card.  
   - Check if your Quest is complete. If yes, take the reward and draw a new Quest.

6. **Check for Victory**  
   - If in Baghdad and your Destiny/Story goal is met, declare victory.  
   - All other players get one final turn.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Encounters
Each encounter has four steps:
1. **Discover Who or What You Have Encountered**  
   - Roll 1d6 + terrain/gem value (if any) + bonus for Destiny Points (3–4 = +1, 5+ = +2).  
   - Max total = 12. Use this number on the Encounter Chart to find the encounter and Reaction Matrix.

2. **Choose Your Reaction**  
   - The Matrix Reader reads available reactions (e.g., Aid, Attack, Court).  
   - You choose one. Note the base paragraph number.

3. **Determine Your Destiny**  
   - Roll the Destiny Die:  
     - **–**: use paragraph number –1  
     - **blank**: use base paragraph  
     - **+**: use paragraph number +1  
   - If you have a Master-level skill listed in any of the three possible paragraphs, you may choose that paragraph directly (no roll required).

4. **Read the Result Paragraph**  
   - The Reader reads the result aloud.  
   - Effects in brackets indicate gains/losses:  
     - **D**: Destiny Points  
     - **S**: Story Points  
     - **W**: Wealth Level (with possible max/min)  
     - Skills: Gained at Talent level; if already owned, upgrade to Master  
     - Statuses: Apply immediately (italicized)  
     - **Treasure**: Gain the specified or random treasure

### Skills
- Each skill has Talent and Master sides.
- At Master level, you may bypass the Destiny Die if your skill appears in any of the three possible paragraphs.
- "Mandatory" skill sections must be used if you have the listed skill/status/treasure.

### Places of Power
- 10 hidden locations on the map with one-way exit arrows.
- Cannot enter normally.
- Gain an "opportunity to enter" via a story result → place Destination marker on it.
- While marked, you may move there normally (movement ends immediately).
- Only one Destination marker allowed at a time.
- If moved directly to a Place of Power by an effect, go there immediately and resolve the encounter.
- After encounter, move to the space indicated by the arrow (unless told otherwise).

### Wealth
- Determines movement (land and sea).
- Ranges: Beggar → Poor → Respectable → Rich → Princely → Fabulous.
- **Fabulous wealth requires owning at least one treasure**.
- If you lose your last treasure while Fabulous, drop to Princely.
- Never below Beggar; never above Fabulous.

### Selling Treasures
- May sell any treasure when ending your turn in a city (after encounters and card plays).
- Gain Wealth as shown on the card, up to the maximum listed.
- Return the card to the deck.

### Death
- If your character dies:
  - Move to Baghdad.
  - Remove Origin, Quest, and Destination markers.
  - Reduce Wealth to Poor.
  - Lose all treasures and statuses.
  - Keep skills, Destiny Points, and Story Points.
  - Continue playing (your sibling takes over).
- If you meet your goal before dying, you may still declare victory.

### Quests
- Each player starts with one face-up Quest card.
- Complete requirements (listed on card) to gain reward and draw a new Quest.
- Quests may involve locations, skills, statuses, or treasures.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory**: Be the first to meet your secret Destiny/Story goal and return to Baghdad.
- Upon declaring victory, all other players get one final turn.
- After that, any player in Baghdad who meets their goal wins.
- **Tiebreakers** (in order):
  1. Most Statuses
  2. Most Skills
  3. Shared victory if still tied

- Destiny and Story Points cannot go below zero.
- You cannot choose an action that would reduce either below zero.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Movement with Destination Marker**: If your Destination marker is on a Place of Power, you may move there as if it were a normal space.
- **Free Movement**: If an encounter grants a free move (e.g., “move to any coastal space”), no second encounter unless you land on a Place of Power.
- **Master Skills**: You may choose to roll the Destiny Die even if you could bypass it with a Master skill.
- **Status Effects**: Must be followed every turn. Other players should enforce them.
- **City Encounter Cards**: Keep them after drawing; play later in the named city for a die-roll reward.
- **Encounter Deck Exhaustion**: When deck runs out, reshuffle discards and replace marker: Morning → Noon → Night → Night (fourth+ use).
