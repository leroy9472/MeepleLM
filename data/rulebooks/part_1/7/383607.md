### 1. Lore & Objective
In the solo mode of Barcelona, you compete against Gaudi, a renowned architect representing an automated opponent. The objective is to earn more Victory Points than Gaudi by constructing buildings, developing infrastructure, and completing projects in 19th-century Barcelona, all while balancing adherence to Ildefons Cerdà’s urban plan.

### 2. Components
- Main Board
- Side Board
- Player Board (Automa side used for Gaudi)
- 8 Solo Cards (Gaudi deck)
- 1 Wooden Meeple (Gaudi's meeple)
- Citizen Tokens (Working, Middle, Upper Class)
- Building Tiles, Street Tiles, Intersection Tiles, Cobblestone Tiles
- Public Service Tiles, Modernisme Tiles, Sagrada Familia Tiles
- Coins and Cloth Tokens
- Building Markers, Passengers, Modernisme Markers
- Cerdà Scoring Tiles

### 3. Setup
1. Set up the game as a 2-player game with these adjustments:
   - Use the Automa side of the player board for Gaudi.
   - Place Gaudi’s meeple on the central street crossing.
   - Do not place Coins or Cloth in Gaudi’s Warehouse.
   - Shuffle the 8 Solo Cards to form the Gaudi deck.
   - Place Sagrada Familia tiles with only Victory Point benefits on Gaudi’s board. Randomly remove one tile of each level from the remaining pool.
   - Give the First Player token to the human player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Players take turns starting with the human player.
- On Gaudi’s turn:
  1. Flip the top card of the Gaudi deck.
  2. Move Gaudi’s meeple to an empty street crossing based on priority rules.
  3. Draw and stack 2 Citizens (prioritizing Upper > Middle > Working Class) where the meeple is placed.
  4. Perform the action(s) shown on the flipped card.
  5. Attempt to construct a Building.
  6. After Cerdà Scoring phases, reset Gaudi’s meeple and Cerdà marker (after first two scorings), and reshuffle the Gaudi deck.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Gaudi Reward (GR):**  
- Gaudi converts all Coins and Cloth into GR immediately.
- 1 GR = 2 VP (Easy), 3 VP (Normal), or 4 VP (Hard).
- GR is used during Cerdà Scoring and final scoring.

**Selecting a Street Crossing:**  
Gaudi moves his meeple according to this priority:
1. A street crossing with his own Intersection tile.
2. A location where he can build a Building after placing Citizens.
3. A crossing without the player’s Intersection tile.
- In case of ties, use the arrow on the top card of the Gaudi deck (rotating clockwise from Gaudi’s current position) to break the tie.
- If no valid adjacent crossings exist, check 2, 3, etc., spaces away.

**Performing Actions:**  
If Gaudi cannot perform the action on the flipped card, draw a new card until he can. If the deck runs out, reshuffle the discard pile.  
Actions include:
- **Place Cobblestone:** Place leftmost tile following adjacency rules; gain benefits in priority order listed on the card.
- **Build Wide/Narrow Streets:** Build adjacent to meeple, prioritizing beneficial spaces; use arrow to break ties.
- **Build Intersection:** Choose intersection with highest adjacent benefit total; convert Coins/Cloth into GR.
- **Take Modernisme Project:** Take the tile indicated by the card’s arrow; place on rightmost empty space on Gaudi’s board.
- **Improve Modernisme Project Space:** Move leftmost bottom-position marker to top.
- **Build Public Service:** Choose most expensive unbuilt service (left to right); gain Cerdà progress and VP, then draw a new card and perform its action instead of the building’s ability.
- **Place Passenger:** Place on adjacent street (prioritize own streets, avoid opponent’s); if placed on a built street, score it normally, then draw a new card and perform its action instead of the street’s action.
- **Move on Sagrada Familia Track:** Advance one step; if passing a tile slot, gain the corresponding Sagrada Familia tile and its benefits.

**Construct a Building:**  
After performing actions, Gaudi attempts to build, prioritizing:
1. Level-3 Buildings
2. Level-2 Buildings
3. Level-1 Buildings
4. Corner Buildings  
- If multiple options, use the arrow on the Gaudi card to select.
- Gaudi gains standard rewards but **does not move back** on the Cerdà track when building Level-2 or Level-3 buildings.
- If more Citizens are available than needed, use the arrow (centered on the building site) to select which ones to use.

**Adjusted Solo Mode (Gaudi 2.0):**  
- The Automa deck is used only for card backs (direction indicators).
- Gaudi prioritizes placing Citizens in the direction shown on the back of the top card, moving clockwise until he finds a buildable location.
- Placement priority:
  1. Own intersection + can build
  2. Can build (no intersection)
  3. Player’s intersection + can build
  4. Anywhere (cannot build)
- After building, Gaudi moves his meeple again in the direction shown on the card.
- Gaudi is affected by building types:
  - Loses Cerdà track steps when building blue (Level-3) and pink (Level-2) buildings.
  - Prioritizes green (Level-1) over pink if first building.
  - Blue remains highest priority when possible.
- For Public Services: takes leftmost/most expensive and **performs the action**.
- For Modernisme Projects:
  - Always takes the highest-scoring tile (leftmost in case of tie).
  - Upgrades from right to left.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Cerdà Scoring:**  
Triggered when a Citizen track section is filled to a scoring marker.  
- Gaudi scores: (Cerdà Tile VP) × (Gaudi’s Cerdà Track Multiplier) × (GR Value based on difficulty).
- After scoring, reset Gaudi’s Cerdà marker (after first two scorings) and meeple to center.
- Reshuffle Gaudi deck.

**Final Scoring:**  
- **Cobblestones:** Rightmost uncovered value on Gaudi’s board.
- **Passengers:** Rightmost uncovered value on Passenger track.
- **Modernisme Tiles:** For each tile, score (Tile VP) × (Marker Multiplier) × (GR Value).
- **Empty Modernisme Spaces:** Score as if they had a 1 GR tile (in updated solo mode).
- Gaudi takes one final turn if the player triggers game end.

**Winning:**  
The player wins if they have more Victory Points than Gaudi. Ties or lower scores result in a Gaudi victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **No valid action on card:** Draw a new card until one can be performed.
- **No valid street crossing:** Expand search radius (2, 3, etc. spaces) using priority list and arrow tiebreaker.
- **Gaudi cannot build:** Skip building phase.
- **Gaudi reaches end of Sagrada track:** Further advancements have no effect unless playing with difficulty variant (+1 GR per extra step).
- **Deck runs out:** Reshuffle discard pile to form a new deck.
- **Modernisme tile stack empty:** Replenish from discard pile.
