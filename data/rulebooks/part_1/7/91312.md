## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Ankh-Morpork, the chaotic city-state of Discworld, has fallen into disarray following the disappearance of its ruler, Lord Vetinari. Players assume the roles of powerful factions vying for control. Each player has a secret victory condition based on their Personality card. The goal is to achieve personal dominance through influence, wealth, chaos, or control—depending on your identity—before the city descends into complete anarchy.

2. Components  
- Game board depicting 12 city areas (numbered 1–12), each with a name, building cost, and adjacency defined by borders or bridges  
- 4 sets of 12 minion pieces (one color per player)  
- 4 sets of 6 building pieces (one color per player)  
- 12 trouble markers  
- 1 twelve-sided die  
- Money: 35 silver ($1) and 17 gold ($5) coins  
- 7 Personality cards (Lord Vetinari, Lord Selachii, Lord Rust, Lord de Worde, Dragon King of Arms, Chrysoprase, Commander Vimes)  
- 12 City Area cards (one per district)  
- 101 Player cards: 48 green-bordered and 53 brown-bordered  
- 12 Random Event cards  
- 4 demon pieces and 3 troll pieces  
- 4 Player Aid cards  

3. Setup  
(1) Place the board in the center. Shuffle the 12 Random Event cards and place them face down beside the board. Place the 12 trouble markers, die, demon/troll pieces, and money (Bank) nearby.  
(2) Shuffle the 53 brown-bordered Player cards, then place the shuffled 48 green-bordered cards on top to form a single draw pile. Deal 5 cards face down to each player.  
(3) Each player selects a color and takes:  
 a) 12 minions and 6 buildings of that color  
 b) $10 from the Bank (money is public)  
 c) 1 Personality card (kept secret)  
 d) 1 Player Aid card  
(4) Each player places one minion in The Shades, The Scours, and Dolly Sisters.  
(5) Place one trouble marker in each of those three areas.  
(6) Shuffle Personality cards before dealing; set aside unused ones without revealing.  
(7) Place the 12 City Area cards face up beside the board for all to see.  
(8) Determine the first player randomly using the die.  

Note: In 2-player games, remove Chrysoprase from Personality cards and remove Hubert and Cosmos Lavish from the brown deck before shuffling.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn:  
1. At the start of their turn, check victory condition (if met, declare victory).  
2. Play one card from hand.  
3. Resolve actions from left to right; all actions are optional except Random Event (mandatory).  
4. Complete each action fully before beginning the next.  
5. After finishing, if hand size is less than 5, draw from the draw pile to reach 5.  
6. Play passes clockwise.  

A player may play additional cards during their turn if an action allows “Play another card.” Interrupt cards may be played at any time, even out of turn.

5. Core Mechanics  
Place a Minion:  
- Place in an area where you already have a minion, or adjacent to one.  
- If you have no minions on the board, place in any area.  
- No limit on minions per area.  
- If all minions are on the board, you may remove and reposition one following placement rules.  

Trouble Markers:  
- Place a trouble marker whenever a minion is placed or moved into an area with ≥1 other minion (including your own, trolls, or demons).  
- Only one trouble marker per area.  
- Remove the trouble marker if any minion is removed or moved from the area.  
- Effects:  
 a) Assassination only allowed in areas with a trouble marker.  
 b) Cannot build in an area with a trouble marker.  

Place a Building:  
- Must have at least one of your minions in the area.  
- Cannot build if the area has a trouble marker or another building.  
- Pay the cost shown on the board/City Area card to the Bank.  
- Take the matching City Area card (face up in front of you).  
- You may only have 6 buildings; to place a 7th, remove one first (returning its City Area card).  
- Cannot use a newly acquired City Area card’s ability until your next turn (except Small Gods).  

Assassination:  
- Remove one minion (not your own), troll, or demon from an area with a trouble marker.  
- This also removes the trouble marker.  

Remove a Trouble Marker:  
- Remove one trouble marker from any area of your choice.  

Take Money:  
- Take the amount shown in the gold circle from the Bank.  

Scroll:  
- Perform the text action at the bottom of the card.  

Random Event (Mandatory):  
- Draw the top Random Event card and resolve its effect.  
- After resolution, remove the card from the game (each event occurs only once).  

Play Another Card:  
- Play another card from your hand immediately. Chain continues if new card has same icon.  

Interrupt:  
- Can be played at any time, even out of turn.  
- Does not count as an action if played on your turn.  
- Must be played promptly; cannot be used retroactively.  

City Area Cards (once per turn, cannot use same turn acquired unless Small Gods):  
- The Shades: Place a trouble marker in The Shades or adjacent area (must contain ≥1 minion).  
- Dolly Sisters: Pay $3 to place one of your minions in Dolly Sisters or adjacent area.  
- Dimwell: Pay $3 to place one of your minions in Dimwell or adjacent area.  
- Isle of Gods: Pay $2 to remove one trouble marker from the board.  
- Unreal Estate: Draw one card, then discard one.  
- The Scours: Discard one card to take $2 from the Bank.  
- Nap Hill & Longwall: Take $1 from the Bank.  
- The Hippo & Dragon's Landing: Take $2 from the Bank.  
- Seven Sleepers: Take $3 from the Bank.  
- Small Gods: Pay $3 per piece to protect a minion or building from a Random Event effect.  

Random Events:  
- The Dragon: Roll die; remove all minions, buildings, and trouble markers from that area.  
- Flood: Roll die twice; affected areas adjacent to the river are flooded. Players move minions from flooded areas to adjacent non-flooded areas, starting with active player.  
- Fire: Roll die; if building present, remove it and continue rolling for adjacent buildings until fire stops.  
- Fog: Reveal and discard top 5 cards of draw pile.  
- Riots: If ≥8 trouble markers on board, game ends immediately.  
- Explosion: Roll die; remove any building in that area.  
- Mysterious Murders!: Each player rolls die and removes one minion of their choice from that area. If only your minions are there, you must remove one.  
- Demons from the Dungeon Dimensions: Roll die 4 times; place one demon in each area rolled. Place trouble marker if none present. Demons block area control, card use, and scoring.  
- Subsidence: All players pay $2 per building; unaffordable buildings are removed.  
- Bloody Stupid Johnson: Roll die; if matching City Area card is in play, remove it from game and owner removes one minion from that area.  
- Trolls: Roll die 3 times; place one troll in each area. Place trouble marker if area has minions. Trolls count as neutral minions.  
- Earthquake: Roll die twice; remove buildings from those areas.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when:  
(1) A player meets their Personality condition at the start of their turn.  
(2) The “Riot” Random Event is drawn and ≥8 trouble markers are on the board.  
(3) A player draws the last card from the draw pile.  

Personality Victory Conditions (must be true at start of turn):  
- Lord Vetinari: Have minions in 11 (2p), 10 (3p), or 9 (4p) different areas, all demon-free.  
- Lords Selachii, Rust, de Worde: Control 7 (2p), 5 (3p), or 4 (4p) areas. Control = more pieces (minions + buildings) than any other single player and more than total trolls; no demons allowed.  
- Dragon King of Arms: 8+ trouble markers on board.  
- Chrysoprase: Net worth ≥$50 (cash + sum of building costs − $12 per loan card held).  
- Commander Vimes: Wins if no one else wins when draw pile is exhausted.  

If draw pile is exhausted and no Vimes:  
- Score points:  
 • 5 points per minion on board  
 • Building points = its monetary cost  
 • 1 point per $1 cash  
 • −15 points per unpaid loan (Dent or Bank card)  
- Tiebreaker: Player with highest-cost City Area card wins. If still tied, joint victory.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can you place a minion in an area with only your minions?  
 A: Yes. A trouble marker must still be placed.  
- Q: Can you build in an area with trolls or demons?  
 A: Yes, as long as you have a minion, no trouble marker, and no building.  
- Q: Can Small Gods protect against demons?  
 A: Yes. Pay $3 to prevent a demon from being placed in an area with your piece.  
- Q: Can you use Dimwell/Dolly Sisters to place a minion adjacent to your minion?  
 A: No. The ability allows placement in Dimwell/Dolly Sisters or adjacent areas—regardless of where your minions are.  
- Q: Can Wallace Sonky block card text effects?  
 A: Yes, but only text effects (e.g., Career, Dr. Whiteface), not symbol actions (e.g., Assassination).  
- Q: Can you pass your turn?  
 A: Yes, unless the card has a Random Event icon (must be resolved).  
- Q: Do interrupts protect against Random Events?  
 A: Only some (e.g., Fresh Start Club, Susan, Igor); Gaspode and Wallace Sonky do not.  
- Q: Can you discard Fools’ Guild or Dr. Whiteface via Scours/Unreal Estate?  
 A: No. These are permanent hand-reduction cards and cannot be discarded.
