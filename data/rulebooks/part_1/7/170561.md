4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has 4 phases:  
1. Roll Phase: Active player rolls 2 dice. Values (each die and sum) activate matching Citizen cards.  
   - Domain cards may modify dice (once per card)  
   - Crimson Seas: For each 6 rolled (die or sum), place 1 Resource of choice on Exekratys  
   - Monster Event: If roll matches activation number, resolve effect before Harvest  
2. Harvest Phase: All players activate Citizens  
   - Active player uses left (on-turn) powers  
   - Others use right (off-turn) powers  
   - Doubles: Activate matching cards twice  
   - Thief activates first, targeting any player  
   - Coxswain: If no Citizens activate or if doubles, gain 1 Resource of choice  
3. Action Phase: Active player takes 2 actions (may repeat)  
   - Slay a Monster: Pay Strength/Magic cost, gain rewards, add to Victory stack  
   - Recruit a Citizen: Pay Gold cost (base +1 per copy owned), add to tableau  
   - Build a Domain: Match required Role icons, pay Gold, gain rewards  
   - Gain a Resource: Take 1 Gold, Strength, or Magic  
   - Gain a Map: Take 1 Map from supply  
   - Engage an Agent: Use face-up Agent ability, return to bottom of deck  
   - Sail: Pay 1 Map, visit island:  
     - Araby: Buy Goods (pay Gold), refill slots  
     - Nae Aerie: Buy Tomes (pay Gold), refill slots  
     - Exekratys: Take all of one Resource type  
     - Amarynth: Rescue Noble (pay 9 +1 per Noble owned), refill slot  
   - Flip a Tome: Spend Tome to pay cost as shown  
   - Use a Relic: Activate "As an action..." ability  
   - Build Ward Tower: Pay 9 of one Resource type (Gold, Strength, Magic), place Banner  
4. End Phase:  
   - Flip used Tomes face-up  
   - Check end-game conditions  
   - Pass dice to left

5. Core Mechanics  
- Activation: Dice values (each and sum) trigger Citizens with matching numbers  
- Resource Tracks: Move tokens right to gain, left to spend. Use +10 markers beyond 10  
- Magic Use: Can substitute for Gold or Strength, but must spend at least 1 non-Magic  
- Role Icons: Worker, Soldier, Shadow, Holy. Used for Domain requirements and Duke scoring  
- Exhausted Stacks: When stack emptied, add top card from Exhausted/Event deck  
- Monster Events: Activate on matching roll, resolve effect, remain in play until replaced  
- Ward Towers: Each completed tower (3 Banners) gives -1 to slay cost (any Resource)  
- Nobles: Role icons count toward Domains and Duke scoring

6. Scoring & End Game  
End Game triggered if:  
- All Monsters slain  
- All Domains built  
- Exhausted stacks = 2 × player count  
- Insufficient Goods, Tomes, or Nobles to refill islands (Crimson Seas)  

Final scoring:  
- Slain Monsters: VP on cards  
- Built Domains: VP on cards  
- Victory tokens on board  
- Duke card: VP based on criteria (Role icons, Resources, etc.)  
- Goods: Match sets score: 1=2, 2=4, 3=7, 4=12, 5=18, 6=25 VP  
- Nobles: VP as indicated  
- Ward Tower Banners: 5 VP each (flipped side)  
- Tomes: 1 VP each  

Tiebreaker: Fewest cards in tableau. If still tied, share victory.
