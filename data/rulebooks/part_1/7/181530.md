## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Runebound is set in the fantasy world of Terrinoth, where players take on the roles of heroes facing threats from ancient cabals, dark rituals, and powerful villains. The objective of the game depends on the chosen scenario, but generally involves completing quests, defeating enemies, and ultimately confronting a major villain or preventing a catastrophic event. Victory is achieved when the scenario-specific victory condition is fulfilled, such as defeating a final boss or stopping a ritual.

2. Components  
- Game board depicting the realm of Terrinoth  
- Hero cards and corresponding combat tokens  
- Adventure gems (combat ✘, exploration A, social ✣)  
- Time token and time track  
- Story deck and story quest tokens  
- 3 adventure decks: Combat, Exploration, Social (30 cards each)  
- Skill deck (60 cards, made from 6 skill sets)  
- Asset deck (formed from 3 of 6 available sets)  
- Gold and damage tokens  
- Prepare tokens  
- Envelope cards (Unbreakable Bonds expansion)  
- Party skill cards (Unbreakable Bonds expansion)  
- Combat boards and enemy tokens (Unbreakable Bonds)  
- Scenario-specific components (e.g., cabal citadels, ritual trackers)  

3. Setup  
- Place adventure gems on matching hexes on the board.  
- Choose a scenario and shuffle its story cards into the base story deck.  
- Separate adventure cards into 3 decks by type (combat, exploration, social). Shuffle in scenario-specific adventure cards to make 30-card decks.  
- Each player chooses a hero, takes starting gold and combat tokens, and draws skill cards equal to their hand size.  
- Heroes are placed on starting locations (shrine, stronghold, or town) of their choice.  
- Resolve hero setup abilities, then flip hero card to active side.  
- Create asset deck from 3 of 6 available sets; deal 3 cards faceup to each city market.  
- Place time token on first space of time track.  
- Follow any scenario-specific setup rules (e.g., placing cabal citadels, adding story quest tokens).

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Players take turns in clockwise order.  
- On your turn, spend 3 actions (→) to Move, Shop, Adventure, Rest, Train, or Prepare.  
- After all players complete their turns, advance the time token one space.  
- When time token reaches a story space, draw and resolve a story card.  
- When time token reaches a gem refresh space (6th and 12th), flip all adventure gems faceup (except those in hero hexes).  
- The time token moves through the track twice: Act 1 (token faceup) and Act 2 (token flipped to "2").  
- Game ends when scenario victory condition is met.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Actions: Each turn, spend 3 actions. Actions can be repeated.  
- Move: Spend 1 action to move 1 adjacent hex or roll dice equal to speed. Match terrain symbols to move. Wilds match all. Roads allow movement using any die. Water dice required for rivers/swamps.  
- Shop (in city): Draw 1 asset card into market. Must either buy or discard 1 card. Always 3 cards in market after action. Sell assets for full price. Only 1 asset per type allowed.  
- Adventure (2 actions): In hex with faceup gem, flip gem and draw matching adventure card (combat, exploration, social).  
- Rest: Spend 1 action. In civilized hex (city, town, shrine, stronghold): heal all damage. In wilderness: roll 5 terrain dice, heal 1 per matching terrain.  
- Train: Spend 1 action. Draw skill cards equal to max hand size, then discard down to hand size.  
- Prepare: Spend 1 unspent action to gain a prepare token. Later, spend token to take 1 extra action. Only 1 prepare token allowed.  
- Exert: Discard 1 skill card to: reroll 1 terrain die, reveal 1 extra card during attribute test, or use a skill/ability.  
- Combat: Initiated by drawing enemy card. Player to right controls enemy. Combat proceeds in rounds: cast tokens, determine initiative (gold symbols), alternate actions. Use symbols to deal damage (physical/magic/enemy), block (shields), use agility (flip/recast), trigger surge abilities (once per round), or double symbols. Retreat after combat actions by rolling 1 die and moving out of hex.  
- Attribute Tests: Reveal cards from skill deck equal to attribute value. Need at least 1 success (star) to pass. Can exert to reveal extra cards.  
- Learning Skills: Spend trophies (facedown adventure cards) to learn skills. Cost is number of orbs (matching trophy type). Learned skills must not exceed attribute values in body/mind/spirit.  
- Time Track: Advances each round. Triggers story cards, gem refreshes, and Act transition.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is no traditional scoring. Victory is determined by scenario completion.  
- Defeating a villain wins the game (for that hero).  
- In cooperative play, all players win or lose together based on scenario goals (e.g., destroy all cabal citadels, defeat final boss).  
- Game ends immediately when victory or loss condition is met (e.g., Margath reaches Tamalir, all cities devastated).
