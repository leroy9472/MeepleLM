## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
You are Taylor Minde, a rookie pilot stranded behind enemy lines. After a failed engagement, your ship’s experimental SAVIOR protocol resets the battle, giving you repeated chances to defeat the alien mothership. The objective is to destroy all sections of the mothership before the final warp ends or your hull is destroyed.

**Win Condition:** Defeat all mothership sections before the final warp.
**Loss Conditions:** Hull reaches zero OR final warp ends with the mothership still active.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game consists of **warps** (rounds). Each **warp** contains multiple **turns**, determined by token draws.

Each **turn** has four steps:

#### Step 1: Enemy Arrivals
- Refill empty slots in the enemy row (up to 4 total), left to right.
- Draw from the top of the enemy deck.
- If deck is empty, refill as many as possible. Do not slide cards together.

#### Step 2: Pilot Actions
You may take any action any number of times, limited only by tokens.

Available actions:
- **Fire Lasers**: Assign laser token (1–3) to a target. Stuns it. If total laser value ≥ hull stat, **destroy** it. Gain destroy reward. Tokens go to discard.
- **Perform Maneuvers**: Assign maneuver token (value 1) to a target. Stuns it. If total ≥ speed stat, **evade** it. Gain evade reward. Tokens go to discard.
- **Repair Shields**: Discard energy token. Gain shields equal to **twice** the energy value. Cannot exceed max.
- **Use a Power Token**: Use one from your pool for its effect. Most count as lasers/maneuvers and stun. Effects vary (e.g., Warhammer instantly destroys one enemy).
- **Buy Tokens**: Discard energy tokens. Gain new tokens from supply with total cost ≤ energy spent. New tokens go into the bag.
- **Activate a Skill**: Assign required tokens (energy/laser/maneuver) to skill card. Must meet or exceed cost in one turn. Once activated, use it at any time during this step. Then exhaust (rotate sideways). Can only be used once per warp.
  - *Ongoing Skills*: Remove tokens from game when used. Effects last for the rest of the game.

At end of step: Move all tokens from **pool** to **discard**. Tokens in **hold** remain.

#### Step 3: Enemy Attacks
Resolve left to right:
1. If target has tokens below it → **stunned**, skip.
2. Else, deal damage equal to attack value.
   - Reduce **shield** by 1 per damage.
   - When shields = 0, reduce **hull**.
3. For each point of shield damage, **remove one token from discard pile** (out of game). If not enough, remove as many as possible.
4. Move tokens from below enemy to above it (no longer stunned).

Mothership attacks (if applicable) occur after all enemy attacks.

#### Step 4: Pilot Plans
- Shake bag, draw 5 tokens into pool.
- If bag is empty during draw → **end of warp**.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Stun**: Assigning any action (laser, maneuver, power token) stuns a target for the turn. Prevents attack and ability use.
- **Tokens**:
  - **Pool**: Tokens available this turn.
  - **Hold**: Limited storage (per starfighter). Tokens survive warp.
  - **Discard**: Tokens used or left in pool. Returned to bag at end of warp.
  - **Supply**: Source for buying or gaining tokens.
- **Rewards** (gained when defeating enemies):
  - Gain laser, energy, maneuver, or power tokens (from supply → bag).
  - Increase shields.
  - Draw 3 tokens into pool.
  - Return 2 tokens from discard to bag.
  - Gain any one token.
  - Gain a skill card.
- **Power Tokens** (examples):
  - *Photon Blast*: Counts as 2 lasers on two adjacent targets.
  - *Warhammer*: Instantly destroy one enemy (cannot stun others with lasers this turn).
  - *Rupture*: Remove from game; gain 4 value-1 tokens (energy/laser/maneuver) into pool.
  - *Enhance*: Upgrade energy or laser tokens in pool to next value.
- **Mothership Sections**:
  - Each has stats, attack, rewards.
  - Defeated with energy, lasers, or maneuvers depending on section.
  - Place damage marker when defeated.
  - Some motherships have conditions to attack (e.g., must clear enemies first).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
There is no scoring. Game ends immediately upon:
- **Win**: All mothership sections defeated before final warp.
- **Loss**: Hull reaches zero OR warp marker reaches end of track.

Do not complete current turn.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Q: Can "enemy" effects target mothership sections?**  
  A: No. "Enemy" = enemy cards only. "Target" = enemy cards or mothership sections.

- **Q: Does warp end if bag has fewer than 5 tokens?**  
  A: Yes. Warp ends during Step 4 if you cannot draw 5 tokens.

- **Q: Do defeated mothership sections carry over between warps?**  
  A: Yes. Damage markers stay. Tokens are reset.

- **Q: Can you stun a target that cannot be evaded/destroyed?**  
  A: Yes. Stun works regardless of defeat method.

- **Q: When are rewards resolved?**  
  A: Immediately upon defeating target in Step 2. Drawn tokens go directly to pool and can be used that turn.

- **Q: Are rewards mandatory?**  
  A: Yes.

- **Q: Can power tokens like Photon Blast stun?**  
  A: Yes. They are assigned to targets and count as attacks.

- **Q: Do removed tokens return?**  
  A: No. Tokens removed due to shield damage are out of game permanently.
