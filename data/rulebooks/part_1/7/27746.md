## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Colosseum*, players take on the role of Roman impresarios competing to stage the most spectacular events in the Colosseum over five turns. The goal is to attract the highest number of spectators in a single event. The player who achieves this wins; ties are broken first by wealth, then by number of Star Performer Awards.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 5 turns. Each turn consists of 5 phases, completed in clockwise order. A player may pass in any phase.

#### Phase 1: Investing  
Each player may make **one** investment:  
- **Buy an Event Program**: Pay listed cost. May buy any available program (no restriction on number order).  
- **Expand Arena**: Pay 10 coins to add one expansion tile (left or right).  
- **Buy Season Ticket**: Pay 10 coins; place in arena. Multiple allowed.  
- **Construct Emperor’s Loge**: Pay 5 coins. Only one per arena.

**Additional Investment**:  
- After first investment, a player may spend **2 Emperor Medals** or discard an **Additional Action Token** to make a second investment.  
- This may be repeated if resources allow.

#### Phase 2: Acquiring Event Asset Tokens  
- Players take turns initiating auctions (starting with start player).  
- **Auction Process**:  
  1. Active player selects a market and makes opening bid of **8+ coins**.  
  2. Bidding proceeds clockwise; each player may bid higher or pass.  
  3. A player who passes cannot re-enter bidding for that auction.  
  4. Winner pays bid and takes all 3 tokens.  
  5. Winner is **excluded** from initiating or bidding in further auctions this phase **unless** the active player changes.  
- **Refill Rules**:  
  - Markets refill **only** when the **initiating player wins** an auction.  
  - Refill using leftover green tokens first, then draw from bag (orange tokens).  
  - If active player loses, they may initiate another auction until they win or pass.  
- Phase ends when every player has had a chance to initiate.

#### Phase 3: Trading Event Asset Tokens  
- Players take turns initiating trades (start player first).  
- Only the **active player** may trade; others may offer trades **with them only**.  
- Tradeable items: coins and standard asset tokens.  
- No future promises; trades resolved immediately.  
- Special tokens (Joker, Additional Action) **cannot be traded**.  
- Tokens acquired during trade **cannot be re-traded** in the same phase.

#### Phase 4: Producing an Event  
Each player may produce **one** event.

**Step 1: Move Nobles**  
- Roll **1 die** (values I–III), or **2 dice** if player has Emperor’s Loge.  
- Move nobles **clockwise**:  
  - One noble may move sum of two dice, or  
  - Two nobles may move separately (one per die).  
- If a noble **ends movement** on a Resting Area, player gains **1 Emperor Medal**.  
- After dice movement, player may spend Emperor Medals to move **any noble** 1–3 spaces forward or backward.  
  - Multiple medals may be used.  
  - **No medal earned** if noble lands on Resting Area via medal move.

**Step 2: Announce and Produce Event**  
- Choose one Event Program from hand.  
- Arena must be large enough (size based on program number).  
- Must use **all applicable standard asset tokens** to maximize score.  
- Joker may substitute for any one standard token; **not required** to use.  
- Score is **not reduced** if Joker is used.

**Step 3: Calculate Spectators (Score)**  
Base score from program, adjusted for missing tokens. Add:  
- +5 per **previous event produced** (turn earlier events face-down)  
- +5 per **Season Ticket**  
- +4 per **Star Performer Award** (only if asset type used in event)  
- +7 if **Emperor** is in your arena  
- +5 per **Consul** in your arena  
- +3 per **Senator** in your arena  
- +3 per **Podium**  
- +3 per **Emperor Medal spent** (discard when used)

**Finalize Event**:  
- Move score marker **up** only if this score exceeds previous highest.  
- Receive **coins = total spectators** (regardless of score marker movement).

#### Phase 5: Closing Ceremony  
*(Skipped after Turn 5)*  
- **Discard**: Each player who produced an event discards **one** asset token used in that event. Discarded tokens are **removed from game** and **visible to all**.  
- **Podium Award**: Player with **highest score** takes a podium.  
  - Tie: richest player wins.  
  - Further tie: roll both dice.  
- **Asset Theft**: Player with **lowest score** steals **one standard asset token** from the podium winner.  
  - Cannot steal Joker or Additional Action.  
  - Tie: poorest player wins.  
  - Further tie: roll both dice.  
- Pass start player token to the left.  
- Advance turn marker.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Star Performer Awards  
- Awarded to first player with **≥3 tokens** of a standard type (Gladiators, Priests, etc.) and **more than any other player**.  
- Joker does **not count** toward count.  
- **Dynamic Transfer**:  
  - If another player gains more of that type, they take the award.  
  - If current holder drops below 3 tokens, award goes to player with ≥3 and most tokens.  
  - If **tie**, award is **set aside** (no one holds it).  
- May be awarded during setup.  
- Trade resolution: Complete trade **before** reassigning award.

#### Emperor Medals  
May be used **anytime**, saved, or reused. Each medal grants one of:  
- +3 spectators during event production  
- Move any noble 1–3 spaces (after dice movement)  
- Receive 6 coins  

**Pair Use**: Spend **2 medals** to make **one additional investment** in Phase 1.  
- Multiple pairs may be used for multiple extra investments.  
- Medals are **returned to supply** after use.

#### Special Asset Tokens

- **Emperor Token**: Immediately exchange for **1 Emperor Medal**. If none available, token is lost.  
- **Additional Action Token**:  
  - Use: Make **second investment** in Phase 1, **or**
