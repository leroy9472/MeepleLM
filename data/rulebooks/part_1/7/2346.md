## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
DVONN is the fourth game in the GIPF project, a two-player abstract strategy game. The objective is to control more pieces than your opponent by stacking them and maintaining connectivity to the red DVONN pieces. The game ends when no more moves are possible, and the player who controls the highest stack wins.

### 2. Components
- 1 hexagonal game board (5×6×5 layout, 49 spaces)
- 23 white pieces
- 23 black pieces
- 3 red DVONN pieces
- 1 rulebook
- 1 storage bag (mentioned in multiple language versions)

### 3. Setup
1. Determine the starting player randomly.
2. The starting player takes the 23 white pieces and 2 DVONN pieces; the other player takes the 23 black pieces and 1 DVONN piece.
3. Place the board horizontally between players so each has 9 spaces along their edge.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in two distinct phases:

**Phase 1: Placing Pieces**
- Players alternate placing one piece at a time on any vacant space.
- Placement order is strictly: White (DVONN), Black (DVONN), White (DVONN), then alternating Black and White regular pieces.
- Phase ends when all 49 spaces are occupied.

**Phase 2: Moving Stacks**
- The same player who started Phase 1 begins Phase 2 immediately after placing their final piece.
- Players alternate turns moving one piece or stack per turn.
- Movement continues until neither player can move.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Ownership**: A stack is controlled by the player whose color is on top.
- **Single Piece Movement**: A single piece (height 1) moves exactly 1 space in any direction, must land on an occupied space.
- **Stack Movement**: A stack of height N must move exactly N spaces in a straight line. Each space (empty or occupied) counts toward the total.
- **Landing**: Moves must end on an occupied space (never empty), but may cross empty spaces.
- **Blocked Pieces**: A piece or stack surrounded on all 6 adjacent spaces cannot move.
- **DVONN Pieces**: Single DVONN pieces cannot be moved, but stacks can move onto them. A stack containing a DVONN piece can be moved by its controller.
- **No Passing**: Players must move if any legal move is available.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Isolation Rule**: Any piece or stack not connected (directly or via chain) to at least one DVONN piece is immediately removed from the board.
- **DVONN Survival**: The 3 DVONN pieces remain in play even if isolated (they are always "connected to themselves").
- **End Condition**: The game ends after the last possible move. If one player cannot move, the other continues until they also cannot move.
- **Rare Reactivation**: If a previously blocked piece becomes unblocked due to opponent's moves, the player must resume moving if possible.
- **Scoring**: Players stack all pieces they control into a single tower. The player with the taller stack wins.
- **Tie**: If stacks are equal height, the game is a draw. Players should count pieces due to potential manufacturing thickness variations.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Who starts Phase 2?** The player who placed the first DVONN piece (White) starts Phase 2, regardless of who placed the last piece.
- **Can you move over empty spaces?** Yes, as long as the total movement equals the stack height and ends on an occupied space.
- **What happens when a move disconnects pieces?** All disconnected pieces/stacks (not linked to any DVONN) are immediately removed, regardless of who caused it.
- **Can you be forced to eliminate your own pieces?** Yes. Since passing is not allowed, players may be forced to make moves that isolate their own stacks (common in endgame).
- **Do removed pieces count for anyone?** No. Removed pieces are out of the game entirely.
- **Can a DVONN piece be on top of a stack?** Yes, and the player whose color is on top controls the stack.
