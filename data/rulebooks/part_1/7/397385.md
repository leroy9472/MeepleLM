## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the late 17th-century Caribbean, players take on the roles of pirate captains seeking fame, fortune, and legendary status. The goal is to amass the most victory points (VP) over three rounds by raiding, exploring, upgrading ships, constructing residences, completing quests, and burying treasure. The game ends after three rounds, and the player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most buried treasure wins; if still tied, the victory is shared.
