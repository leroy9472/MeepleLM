## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative card game set in a comic book universe where players control heroes battling powerful villains and dynamic environments. The objective is for the heroes to work together to defeat the villain by reducing the villain character card to 0 or fewer HP. If all heroes are incapacitated, the villain wins.

2. Components  
- Hero decks (40 cards each), one per hero  
- Villain decks (25 cards each)  
- Environment decks (15 cards each)  
- Hero character cards (with front and back sides)  
- Villain character cards (two-sided)  
- Tokens or dice to track HP  
- Trash piles for each deck  

3. Setup  
- Choose one villain and one environment.  
- Each player selects a hero, places the hero character card in front of them, and shuffles their hero deck.  
- Place the villain and environment decks adjacent to each other, with the villain character cards between them.  
- Follow any "Start of Game" instructions on the villain character card.  
- Each player draws the top 4 cards from their hero deck.  
- The game begins with the Villain Turn.

4. Gameplay Flow  
A full round consists of:  
1. Villain Turn  
2. Hero Turns (one per hero, clockwise)  
3. Environment Turn  

Repeat until victory or defeat.

- Play: Reveal and resolve the top card of the villain deck.  
- End: Resolve any “End of Villain Turn” effects.

Hero Turn:  
- Start: Resolve any “Start of Turn” effects for that hero.  
- Play: Optionally play one card from hand.  
- Power: Optionally use one power from a card in play (each power can be used only once per turn, even if multiple powers are allowed).  
- Draw: Optionally draw one card. If no card was played and no power used, draw two cards instead.  
- End: Resolve any “End of Turn” effects.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Targets: Any card with HP is a target.  
- Damage: Has a type (e.g., Energy, Melee, Psychic). Damage types may interact with specific cards.  
- Dealing Damage:  
  1. Check for redirection or type alteration.  
  2. Check immunity.  
  3. Apply bonuses (e.g., from Nemeses).  
  4. Apply damage reduction.  
  5. Apply damage prevention.  
  6. Reduce target’s HP.  
  7. Destroy target if HP ≤ 0 (except hero/villain character cards).  
- Incapacitated Heroes: When a hero reaches 0 or fewer HP, remove all their cards from play and flip their character card to the incapacitated side. On their turn, they may only use one of the listed incapacitated abilities.  
- Nemeses: If a hero’s icon appears on the villain character card (or vice versa), they are nemeses. All direct damage between them is increased by 1.  
- Flipping Villains:  
  - Baron Blade flips when reduced to 0 HP on his front side; must be defeated again on his back side.  
  - Citizen Dawn flips when 5 Citizen cards are in the villain trash; becomes immune to damage and plays two cards per turn until 3 Citizens are in play.  
  - Grand Warlord Voss flips based on minion count.  
  - Omnitron flips every villain turn; cannot be defeated until no Devices are in play.  
- Reshuffling: If a deck is empty when drawing, playing, or revealing, shuffle its trash to form a new deck.  
- H Value: Equal to the total number of heroes in play (active or incapacitated), used for card effects.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Heroes win if the villain character card is reduced to 0 or fewer HP.  
- Heroes lose if all hero character cards are incapacitated.  
- Some villains or environments may have alternate win/loss conditions.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Simultaneous Effects: Resolve in the order the cards were played.  
- Ties (e.g., highest HP): Players choose which target is affected.  
- Drawing Cards: If a player neither plays a card nor uses a power, they draw two cards. Skipping a turn (via effect) prevents all actions, including drawing.  
- Maximum HP Changes: Increasing or decreasing a target’s maximum HP adjusts current HP by the same amount. Cannot exceed maximum when regaining HP.  
- Immunity: Prevents HP loss from damage, but damage can still be redirected or trigger other effects.  
- Limited Cards: Only one copy of a Limited card (by name) can be in play. Additional copies are discarded upon play.  
- Ongoing/Equipment: Remain in play until destroyed by an effect that specifically targets them.  
- One-Shot Cards: Resolve effects and go to trash.  
- Tracking Effects: Cards that track damage or events only count from the moment they enter play.
