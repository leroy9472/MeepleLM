1. Lore & Objective

The objective is to win rounds by being the last player standing or having the highest-value card when only two remain, earning Affection Tokens. The first player to earn a set number of tokens (typically 3–7, depending on player count) wins the game.

2. Components  
- 16 cards (various roles with values 0–9)  
- Affection Tokens (used for scoring)

3. Setup  
- Determine number of players (2–4).  
- Shuffle the full deck.  
- Deal 1 card to each player.  
- Draw 1 additional card and place it face down (this starts the discard pile).  
- Remaining cards form the draw deck.  
- Give the starting player the first-player marker (optional).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order. Each turn proceeds as follows:  
1. Draw: Draw 1 card from the deck. You now hold 2 cards.  
2. Play: Choose 1 of your 2 cards to play and resolve its effect.  
3. Discard: Discard the played card.  
- After playing, your turn ends.  

The round ends when:  
- Only one player remains (others eliminated), OR  
- The draw deck is exhausted.  

5. Core Mechanics  
Card Effects (in order by value):  
- **0-Jester**: Choose a player. If that player wins the round, you gain 1 Affection Token.  
- **0-Assassin**: If another player targets you with a Guard, that player is eliminated instead of you. Discard Assassin and draw a new card.  
- **1-Guard**: Name a number (not 1) and choose a player. If that player has that number in hand, they are eliminated.  
- **2-Priest**: Choose a player; look at their hand.  
- **2-Cardinal**: Choose two players; they swap hands. You may look at one of the two hands.  
- **3-Baroness**: Choose one or two players; look at their hands.  
- **3-Baron**: Choose another player. Secretly compare hands. Lower value is eliminated. Ties: no effect.  
- **4-Handmaid**: You cannot be targeted by other players’ card effects until your next turn.  
- **4-Sycophant**: Choose a player. The next card played (by anyone) that requires choosing a player must choose them, if possible.  
- **5-Prince**: Choose a player. They discard their hand and draw a new card. If they discard the Princess, they are eliminated.  
- **5-Count**: If this card is in your discard pile at the end of the round, add 1 to the value of the card in your hand when determining winner.  
- **6-King**: Choose another player. Trade hands with them.  
- **6-Constable**: If you are eliminated and this card is in your discard pile, gain 1 Affection Token.  
- **7-Countess**: Must be played immediately if you hold it along with the King or Prince.  
- **7-Dowager Queen**: Choose another player. Secretly compare hands. The higher value is eliminated.  
- **8-Princess**: If you discard this card (by playing it or via Prince), you are eliminated.  
- **9-Bishop**: Name a number (not 1) and choose a player. If correct, gain 1 Affection Token. That player may discard their hand and draw a new card.  

Special Rules:  
- **Hand Limit**: Always 1 card in hand. After drawing, you must play one card.  
- **Elimination**: Players who are eliminated discard their hand and take no further actions in the round.  
- **Handmaid Protection**: While protected, ignore all card effects targeting you (except Sycophant enforcement).  
- **Sycophant Enforcement**: The next card effect requiring a target must include the chosen player if possible. If not possible (e.g., only self-targeting), ignore.  
- **Princess Loss**: Discarding the Princess (any way) causes immediate elimination.  
- **Countess Compulsion**: If you hold Countess + King or Prince, you must play Countess.  
- **Ties**: When comparing hands (Baron, Dowager Queen), ties result in no elimination.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
At the end of each round:  
- If one player remains: they win the round.  
- If deck runs out: all remaining players reveal hands. Highest value wins.  
  - Apply **Count** effect (add 1 if in discard).  
  - **Princess beats Bishop** in ties (per source).  
- Winner receives 1 Affection Token.  
- **Jester**: If the chosen player wins, the Jester holder gains 1 Affection Token.  
- **Constable**: If eliminated with Constable in discard, gain 1 Affection Token.  
- **Bishop**: If guess is correct, gain 1 Affection Token (regardless of round outcome).  

First player to earn a predetermined number of Affection Tokens wins:  
- 2 players: 7 tokens  
- 3 players: 5 tokens  
- 4 players: 4 tokens  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play the Countess voluntarily?** Only if not holding King or Prince. If you do, you may.  
- **What if Sycophant is played last?** It affects the very next card played, even in a new round.  
- **Can I target myself?** No, unless a card allows it (none currently do).  
- **Does Prince force discard of Princess?** Yes. If a player discards Princess via Prince, they are eliminated.  
- **Can Guard name 1?** No. Cannot guess "1".  
- **Can I use Guard on a Handmaid-protected player?** Yes, but effect resolves after protection ends (next turn).  
- **What if all players are eliminated simultaneously?** No one wins. No token awarded.  
- **Can Bishop’s target refuse to redraw?** No — “may” means they have the option. They can choose not to.
