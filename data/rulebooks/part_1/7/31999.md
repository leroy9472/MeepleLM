## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
TZAAR is the second game in the GIPF project, a strategic two-player abstract game. The objective is to either eliminate one of your opponent’s three piece types entirely or force them into a position where they cannot make a mandatory capture on their turn.

2. Components  
- 1 game board (hexagonal grid with a central gap, 60 intersection points as playing spaces)  
- 60 playing pieces:  
  - 30 white: 6 Tzaars, 9 Tzarras, 15 Totts  
  - 30 black: 6 Tzaars, 9 Tzarras, 15 Totts  
- 1 storage bag  
- Rulebook (multi-language)

3. Setup  
- Players sit opposite each other with the long side of the board oriented between them.  
- All 60 pieces are placed randomly on the board’s intersections (playing spaces), filling every space.  
- Colors are determined by lot; White moves first.  

Alternative setups:  
- Fixed starting position (see Diagram 4)  
- Tournament version: Board starts empty. Players alternate placing one piece at a time (any type, in any order) until all 60 are placed. White begins. Then regular gameplay starts.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- **First Turn (White only):** One action — must be a capture.  
- **All Subsequent Turns:** Two actions per turn, in order:  
  1. **First Action (Mandatory):** A capture of an opponent’s piece or stack.  
  2. **Second Action (Choice):** Choose one of:  
     - Make a second capture  
     - Strengthen (stack) one of your own pieces  
     - Pass  

Actions may use the same or different pieces.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Movement & Capture:**  
  - A piece or stack moves in a straight line along the grid lines, over any number of empty spaces, and captures the first opponent’s piece or stack it encounters.  
  - Cannot jump over occupied spaces.  
  - Cannot move to an empty space; all movement must result in a capture (first action) or stacking (second action).  
  - The central gap in the board blocks movement; pieces cannot move across it.  

- **Strength & Stacking:**  
  - Strength is determined solely by height (number of pieces in a stack), not type.  
  - A piece/stack can capture an opponent’s piece/stack of equal or lesser height.  
  - Stacking: To strengthen, move one of your pieces/stacks onto another of your pieces/stacks (adjacent or in a straight line over empty spaces).  
  - Stacks can be of any height and are treated as a single unit (moved and captured whole).  
  - Any of your pieces/stacks can stack onto any other of your pieces/stacks, regardless of type or height.  
  - The type of a stack is determined only by the top piece. Internal pieces lose their type identity for game purposes.

- **Key Restrictions:**  
  - Cannot move to an empty space.  
  - Cannot jump over other pieces.  
  - Cannot move through the central gap.  
  - Stacks can only contain pieces of one color.  
  - Order of actions must be followed strictly: mandatory capture first, then optional second action.

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when one of the following occurs:  
1. A player captures the last remaining visible piece of a type (Tzaar, Tzarra, or Tott) from the opponent.  
   - "Visible" means: single pieces or the top piece of a stack.  
   - Pieces buried within a stack do not count toward type presence.  
2. A player cannot perform the mandatory first-action capture on their turn.  

The player who triggers either condition wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you capture with a stack?** Yes, as long as the stack is at least as tall as the target.  
- **Can you stack any piece onto any other?** Yes, any of your pieces/stacks can stack onto any other of your pieces/stacks.  
- **Does stacking count as a move?** Yes, stacking is the second action option.  
- **Can you pass the first action?** No, the first action (capture) is mandatory.  
- **Can you use the same piece for both actions?** Yes.  
- **What happens if all your pieces are stacked?** As long as the top pieces of your stacks represent all three types, you are still in the game.  
- **Can you move through the center?** No, the board has no central space; movement cannot cross it.
