# Legends of Andor — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The heroes must protect the land of Andor from evil creatures and complete specific quests across five separate Legends. Each Legend presents a unique story and goal revealed through Legend cards. The heroes win a Legend by completing its goal before the Narrator reaches the "N" space on the Legend track. The game is lost if the Narrator reaches "N" or if too many creatures enter the castle (based on the number of golden shields, which depends on player count).

- Place the Narrator on the "A" space of the Legend track.  
- Each player chooses a hero and takes the matching hero board, dice, time marker (wooden disk), and strength cube.  
- Place article tokens on the equipment board.  
- Shuffle fog tokens and place them face-down on designated spaces.  
- Place well tokens, gemstones, rune stones, and farmers as directed by the Legend.  
- Read Legend card A1 aloud to begin.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds in days. Each day has 7 regular hours per hero, plus up to 3 overtime hours (each costing 2 willpower).  
- On a hero’s turn, they may:  
  - Move (1 hour per space)  
  - Fight (1 hour per battle round)  
  - Pass (1 hour)  
  - Use “move prince” or “move shield dwarves” (1 hour per action)  
- After acting, the next hero clockwise takes their turn.  
- A hero ends their day by placing their time marker in the sunrise box. The first to do so places it on the rooster space.  
- When all heroes end their day, execute sunrise box steps in order:  
  1. Resolve top event card  
  2–6. Move creatures in order: gors → skrals → wardraks → trolls → wardraks  
     - Move each creature along the arrow toward the castle  
     - If destination is occupied, move one additional space  
  7. Refresh all wells (flip face-up) unless a hero occupies the space  
  8. Advance Narrator 1 space on Legend track  
     - If a star is reached, draw and resolve the corresponding Legend card  
- New day begins with the hero on the rooster space. All heroes regain 7 hours and up to 3 overtime hours.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Movement**: Costs 1 hour per space. River can only be crossed via bridges. Multiple heroes may occupy the same space.  
- **Fighting**:  
  - Hero rolls all dice (number based on current willpower).  
  - Battle value = highest die + strength points.  
  - Helm: doubles identical dice values (cannot combine with witch’s brew).  
  - Witch’s brew: doubles one die per round (front or back side; cannot combine with helm).  
  - Creature rolls: highest die counts; identical dice are summed if total > other dice.  
  - Difference in battle values is subtracted from loser’s willpower. Draw = no effect.  
  - Battle ends when one side has 0 willpower.  
    - Hero wins: choose gold or willpower reward; Narrator advances 1 space.  
    - Hero loses: lose 1 strength (if >1), gain 3 willpower.  
- **Fighting Together**:  
  - One hero invites others to battle (all must be on same/adjacent space).  
  - All participants spend 1 hour.  
  - Total strength of all heroes + sum of each hero’s highest die = collective battle value.  
  - If heroes win, divide reward. Only final round participants receive reward.  
  - Wizard may use ability to flip another hero’s die immediately after roll.  
- **Free Actions** (no time cost, even out of turn, if not in sunrise box):  
  - Activate fog token (if ending move on it)  
  - Empty well (+3 willpower)  
  - Pick up/drop tokens (gold, gemstones, articles)  
  - Trade with adjacent hero or via falcon  
  - Buy from merchant (when on merchant space)  
  - Use articles (e.g., wineskin, shield, falcon)  
- **Articles**:  
  - Wineskin: use one side per move to move 1 space free  
  - Shield: block 1 willpower loss in battle or negate negative event card (2 uses)  
  - Bow: attack adjacent creature; archer rolls dice one at a time, may stop  
  - Helm: sum identical dice values in battle  
  - Telescope: reveal adjacent face-down tokens (no activation)  
  - Falcon: trade small items, gold, gems between any two heroes (1 use/day)  
  - Witch’s brew: double one die per battle round (2 uses)  
  - Medicinal herb: use for free move, +willpower, or +battle value (value not split)  
  - Rune stones: collect 3 different colors → gain black die (higher value than hero dice)  
- **Special Rules**:  
  - Fog tokens: activate only when ending move on them  
  - Wells: empty for +3 willpower; refresh at sunrise unless occupied  
  - Gemstones (Legend 5): place on space to lure creature there at sunrise  
  - Rubble: remove via fight action; battle value must meet or exceed rubble value  
  - Farmers: carry and bring to castle; each allows 1 extra creature in castle  
  - Prince Thorald / Shield Dwarves: move up to 4 spaces per “move prince” action (1 hour); adds 4 strength if in battle with creature

6. Scoring & End Game  
- No cumulative scoring. Victory is determined per Legend.  
- Win: Complete Legend goal before Narrator reaches "N".  
- Lose:  
  - Narrator reaches "N"  
  - Too many creatures enter castle (exceed golden shields)  
  - Specific Legend failure condition (e.g., Tarok not defeated in time)  
- After defeating Tarok (Legend 5), game ends immediately—Narrator moves to "N".
