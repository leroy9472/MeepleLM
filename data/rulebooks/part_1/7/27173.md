## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   The players lead Viking groups to explore islands near their homeland, settling craftsmen and nobles while defending against ship attacks using warriors. The goal is to score the most victory points (VPs) after 6 rounds by strategically placing tiles and Vikings, managing resources, and optimizing endgame bonuses.

2. **Components**  
   - 1 game board with selection wheel  
   - 4 player bases (homelands)  
   - 76 tiles: 62 island tiles, 14 ship tiles, 4 start tiles  
   - 78 Vikings (13 each in blue/fisherman, yellow/goldsmith, green/scout, red/noble, black/warrior, gray/boatsman)  
   - 45 coins (10×10, 15×5, 20×1)  
   - 8 player markers (2 per player in 4 colors)  
   - 1 start player token (ship)  
   - 25 special tiles (for "progress version")  
   - 1 cloth bag  
   - 4 scoring summary cards  

3. **Setup**  
   - Place board in center; position wheel (initial position unimportant).  
   - Each player takes:  
     - 1 homeland base  
     - 1 start tile (unused tiles removed if <4 players)  
     - 1 scoring summary card  
     - Coins: 30 (2p), 25 (3p), 20 (4p)  
     - 2 player markers: one on score track at 10, one on homeland to show color  
   - Stack 6 face-down tile piles of 12 on board supply spaces.  
   - Place remaining coins as bank.  
   - Put all Vikings in cloth bag; mix thoroughly.  
   - Choose start player; give them start player token.  

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   Each of 6 rounds follows this sequence:  
   1. **Lay Out Offering**:  
      - Draw next stack of 12 tiles.  
        - First island tile → space 0; subsequent islands → increasing values (1,2,...).  
        - First ship tile → space 11; subsequent ships → decreasing values (10,9,...).  
      - Draw 12 Vikings from bag.  
        - Place clockwise from 0 in order: blue, yellow, green, red, black, gray (by color group).  
   2. **Acquire Sets**:  
      - Players take turns (clockwise) buying 1 tile/Viking set.  
      - Pay cost shown (0–11).  
      - May only buy set at 0 if:  
        - Its Viking is last of its color on wheel, OR  
        - Cannot afford any other set (may trade 1 VP for 1 coin to avoid).  
      - After buying 0-set, rotate wheel clockwise to next available set.  
      - On first turn, place both start tile and acquired tile.  
   3. **Place Tile**:  
      - **Ship**: Top row.  
        - First 3 ships → any of columns 1–3 (must touch another after first).  
        - Later ships → fill columns left to right (4+).  
      - **Island Tile**: Rows 2–6.  
        - Must orthogonally touch homeland or existing island tile.  
        - Must match edges: land–land or sea–sea.  
        - Cannot rotate; must be placed right-side up.  
        - If unplaceable, discard tile.  
   4. **Place Viking**:  
      - May place on newly placed island tile **only if**:  
        - Tile is in row matching Viking’s color.  
      - Otherwise, place Viking on homeland next to boatsman graphic.  
      - Gray boatsmen always go to homeland.  
      - Only one Viking per island tile.  
   5. **Scoring**:  
      - **Small Scoring** (Rounds 1,3,5):  
        - 3 gold per non-threatened goldsmith.  
      - **Large Scoring** (Rounds 2,4,6):  
        1. **Boatsmen Use**: Discard boatsmen to move Vikings from homeland to empty island tiles:  
           - 1 boatsman → all of 1 color OR 1 of each available color.  
           - Must use all boatsmen in final large scoring (Round 6).  
        2. **Ships & Warriors**:  
           - Warrior directly below ship → repels it.  
           - Repelled ship: gain gold/VP shown.  
           - Unrepelled ship: threatens all Vikings below down to row matching sail color.  
           - Threatened Vikings earn no points/gold.  
        3. **Nobles**: 2 VP each (if not threatened).  
        4. **Scouts**: 1 VP each + 1 VP per non-threatened goldsmith/fisherman directly below.  
        5. **Goldsmiths**: 3 gold each (if not threatened).  
   6. **Next Round**:  
      - Pass start player token to left.  
      - Begin new round.  

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Threatened Vikings**: A Viking is threatened if in a column under a ship, down to the row matching the ship’s sail color, and no warrior is directly beneath the ship.  
   - **Tile Placement**:  
     - Islands must connect orthogonally and match terrain edges.  
     - Ships build a continuous row starting in columns 1–3.  
   - **Viking Placement**:  
     - Only matching row or homeland.  
     - Cannot move once placed (except via boatsmen).  
   - **Resource Management**:  
     - Trade 1 VP for 1 gold at any time (score cannot go below 0).  
   - **Wheel Rotation**: After 0-set is taken, rotate wheel clockwise to bring next set to 0 (reducing all prices).  

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   After Round 6:  
   - **Unrepelled Ships**: Pay value shown (gold first, then VP if insufficient).  
   - **Gold**: 1 VP per 5 gold (keep remainder).  
   - **Boatsmen**: 10 VP to player(s) with most remaining.  
   - **Completed Islands**: 7 VP to player(s) with most.  
     - A completed island has no gaps: left end, middle(s), right end.  
   - **Longest Island**: 5 VP to player(s) with longest (most tiles).  
   - **Feeding (Over/Under Supply)**:  
     - Each non-threatened fisherman on island feeds 5 Vikings (including self).  
     - Count all Vikings (on islands and homeland).  
     - +2 VP per extra Viking fed (over supply).  
     - –1 VP per unfed Viking (under supply).  
   - **Tie Break**: Most gold. If still tied, shared victory.  

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Can I place a Viking on a tile not just acquired?**  
     No. Only the tile just acquired may receive its Viking (if row matches).  
   - **What if I can’t place a tile?**  
     Discard tile; place Viking on homeland.  
   - **Can I use boatsmen to move Vikings between islands?**  
     No. Only from homeland to islands.  
   - **Can I save boatsmen for final scoring?**  
     You must use them in final large scoring if Vikings can be moved.  
   - **What if multiple players tie for boatsmen?**  
     All tied players get 10 VP.  
   - **Can I trade VP for gold after going negative?**  
     No. Score and gold cannot go below 0.  
   - **Do fishermen on homeland feed anyone?**  
     No. Only non-threatened fishermen on islands produce fish.
