## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Scientists have cloned dinosaurs, and players act as zoo managers organizing dinosaur enclosures to attract visitors. The goal is to strategically place dinosaurs in your zoo to maximize victory points based on specific pen requirements and end-game scoring conditions.

2. Components  
- 5 Zoo boards (each with Summer and Winter sides)  
- 60 dinosaurs (10 each of 6 different species, including T-Rex)  
- 1 placement die  
- 1 draw bag  
- Bonus components from expansions (not required for base game):  
  - Laboratory and Infirmary board and 6 extra dinosaurs (alternate module)  
  - 15 bonus scoring cards and 10 die-dodging tokens (Special Attractions expansion)  
  - Aerial Show and Marina boards (official expansions)  

3. Setup  
- Choose number of players (2–5).  
- Each player takes one Zoo board and places it in front of them. All players must use the same side (Summer recommended for beginners).  
- Adjust dinosaurs in the draw bag based on player count:  
  - 2 players: Remove 2 of each species (48 in bag)  
  - 3 players: Remove 4 of each species (36 in bag)  
  - 4 players: Remove 2 of each species (48 in bag)  
  - 5 players: Use all 60 dinosaurs  
- Place remaining dinosaurs back in the box.  
- Youngest player takes the placement die.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game is played over two rounds (four rounds for 2 players). Each round consists of six turns.

- **Start of Round**: Each player draws 6 dinosaurs from the bag (5 per player in 5-player game with Laboratory/Infirmary variant).  
- **Turn Sequence**:  
  1. The player with the placement die rolls it.  
  2. All players simultaneously choose one dinosaur from their hand.  
  3. All players reveal their chosen dinosaur.  
  4. Players place their chosen dinosaur:  
     - The die roller may place their dinosaur in any legal pen or in the River.  
     - All other players must obey the die’s placement condition (see Placement Die).  
     - If a player cannot or does not wish to place legally, they may place the dinosaur in the River.  
  5. After placement, players pass remaining dinosaurs (hidden) to the player on their left.  
  6. The die is passed to the player on the left.  
- Turns repeat until all dinosaurs are placed (6 turns per round).  
- After Round 1, begin Round 2 using the same rules.  
- After Round 2 (or Round 4 for 2 players), the game ends.

5. Core Mechanics  
**Placement Die Conditions** (applies to all players except the roller):  
- **Woodlands**: Place in a pen in the woodlands section (upper half: Forest of Sameness, Woody Trio, King of the Jungle).  
- **Grasslands**: Place in a pen in the grasslands section (lower half: Prairie of Love, Solitary Island, Meadow of Differences).  
- **Restrooms**: Place on the restroom side (right side: King of the Jungle, Meadow of Differences, Solitary Island).  
- **Food Court**: Place on the food court side (left side: Forest of Sameness, Woody Trio, Prairie of Love).  
- **Empty Pen**: Place in a pen with no dinosaurs.  
- **Watch Out for T-Rex**: Place in a pen that does not already contain a T-Rex. (You may still play a T-Rex as long as the pen is T-Rex-free.)

**Pen Rules (Summer Side)**  
- **Forest of Sameness** (upper left): Only one species allowed. Must fill left to right with no gaps. Scores points equal to number of dinosaurs in it.  
- **Meadow of Differences** (mid right): Each dinosaur must be a different species. Must fill left to right with no gaps. Scores points equal to number of dinosaurs.  
- **Prairie of Love** (lower left): Any species. Scores 5 VP per same-species couple (2+ of same species). Multiple couples of same species allowed.  
- **Woody Trio** (mid left): Holds up to 3 dinosaurs (any species). Scores 7 VP only if exactly 3 dinosaurs are present.  
- **King of the Jungle** (upper right): Holds 1 dinosaur. Scores 7 VP if your zoo has at least as many of that species as each opponent. Otherwise 0.  
- **Solitary Island** (lower right): Holds 1 dinosaur. Scores 7 VP only if that species appears nowhere else in your zoo. Otherwise 0.

**Pen Rules (Winter Side)**  
- **A Well-Ordered Wood** (upper left): Only two different species, alternating strictly (e.g., A/B/A/B/A/B). Cannot skip spaces. Scores points equal to number of dinosaurs.  
- **Lovers’ Bridge** (mid left and right): Two sub-pens (one on each side of River). Scores 6 VP per same-species couple with one in each sub-pen. Each sub-pen is treated separately for T-Rex bonus.  
- **The Pyramid** (bottom right):  
  - Bottom row: first 3 dinosaurs  
  - Middle row: next 2 dinosaurs  
  - Top row: final dinosaur  
  - No two same-species dinosaurs may be adjacent (horizontally or vertically).  
  - Scoring: 1 VP per bottom, 2 VP per middle, 3 VP per top dinosaur.  
- **The Lookout** (upper right): Holds 1 dinosaur. Scores 2 VP for each dinosaur of the same species in the zoo of the player to your right.  
- **Quarantine Zone** (lower left): Holds 1 dinosaur. At game end, move it to another pen or River, obeying all placement rules.

**The River**  
- Not a pen.  
- Any dinosaur may be placed here at any time (if placement rules prevent legal pen placement).  
- Each dinosaur in the River scores 1 VP at game end.

**T-Rex Bonus**  
- Each pen containing at least one T-Rex scores 1 additional VP.  
- Multiple T-Rexes in a pen still grant only 1 bonus VP.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after Round 2 (or Round 4 in 2-player game).  
- Players score each pen individually based on its rules.  
- Add 1 VP for each pen containing at least one T-Rex.  
- Add 1 VP for each dinosaur in the River.  
- Total all points.  
- **Tiebreaker**:  
  1. Fewest T-Rexes in zoo.  
  2. If still tied, players share the win.

**Optional Mode: Summer/Winter**  
- Play one game on Summer side, one on Winter side.  
- Add both scores. Highest total wins.

**2-Player Variant**  
- Game lasts 4 rounds instead of 2.  
- At start of each round, draw 6 dinosaurs.  
- Each turn:  
  - Roll die.  
  - Choose one dinosaur to place.  
  - Discard one dinosaur to the box.  
  - Pass remaining dinosaurs to opponent.  
- After 4 rounds, each player will have 12 dinosaurs.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place in the River even if I could place in a pen?** Yes.  
- **Can I place a T-Rex under “Watch Out for T-Rex”?** Yes, as long as the pen does not already contain a T-Rex.  
- **Can a pen have multiple T-Rexes?** Yes, but still only earns 1 bonus VP.  
- **King of the Jungle: What if an opponent has the same number?** You still score 7 VP if you have ≥ all opponents.  
- **Solitary Island: Can I place a species later in another pen?** No — if the species is elsewhere, Solitary Island scores 0.  
- **Can I pass a dinosaur I just received?** Yes — passing is simultaneous and continuous.  
- **Quarantine Zone: Can I move the dinosaur to a pen that requires specific placement?** Yes, but only if the move obeys all rules (e.g., no breaking adjacency rules in The Pyramid).  
- **Tie in draft order for Special Attractions expansion**: Use tiebreakers in order: unused die-dodging tokens, most T-Rexes, most colors, most in one pen, then random.
