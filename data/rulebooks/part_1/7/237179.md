# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
You are a scientist at Lightning Technologies working to perfect the Weather Machine, while corporate spies from Kydarkovia Inc.—Agent White and Agent Pink, collectively known as "the Saboteurs"—attempt to sabotage your efforts. Your goal is to restore the company’s reputation by surpassing the Saboteurs’ Target Value in Climate Points (CP) while meeting key research and funding goals. The Saboteurs aim to overwhelm the system with extreme weather or exhaust the Security Report deck.

## 2. Components
- 2 Saboteur pawns (Agent White, Agent Pink)
- 20 Security Report cards
- 12 Challenge cards
- Priority aid (Priority indicator)
- Hideout board
- Game components from base Weather Machine (not detailed here, assumed present)

## 3. Setup
1. Set up the base 2-player game with the following modifications:
   - Do **not** block the rightmost action space in each Main Location (2, 3, 4).
2. Prepare Goal tiles:
   - Remove all Goal tiles with a majority icon in the top right and the tile requiring 3 Award tokens.
   - Randomly select 2 Goal tiles of each color. If two have the same center icon, discard duplicates and draw until all are unique.
   - Remove all other Goal tiles. The Saboteurs do not use Goal tiles.
3. Assign a player color to the Saboteurs. They do not use a Laboratory, Voucher markers, or Investment/Subsidy tiles.
4. Place the Saboteurs’ Scoring marker at 35 CP (initial Target Value).
5. Place both Turn Order and Initiative markers with you (human player) first.
6. Designate an area near the board as the Saboteurs’ Hideout:
   - Place both Saboteur Bots in the Hideout.
   - Randomly select 2 different Chemicals from the leftmost spaces of the Supply and place them in the Hideout.
7. Prepare the Security Report deck:
   - Shuffle all 20 Security Report cards and place face down to the left of the Hideout board.
   - Reveal cards one by one until the first card depicting a Main Location appears. Place it face up to the right of the Hideout (discard pile).
     - Move the corresponding Research token (matching Location and weather) to the Hideout.
     - Place the depicted Saboteur on the middle action space of that Location.
   - Continue revealing until a card depicting a Main Location and the **other** Saboteur appears. Place it on top of the discard pile.
     - Move the corresponding Research token to the Hideout.
     - Place the depicted Saboteur on the middle action space of that Location. If occupied, use the rightmost space.
   - Shuffle the remaining Security Report cards (excluding the 2 discarded) and return as the draw deck.
   - Reveal the top card of the deck and place it face up above the Hideout board as the **Current Report**. The top card of the discard pile is the **Previous Report**.
8. (Optional) Select 1 or more Challenge cards to increase difficulty.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
- Turns alternate between you and the Saboteurs.
- You take the first turn in Round 1 after performing the Post-Setup Supply Round (Saboteurs do not participate).
- Turn order proceeds normally based on Initiative and Turn Order markers. If Saboteurs Take the Initiative, they get two consecutive turns.
- On your turn, follow standard 2-player actions with the addition of **Call Security**.
- On the Saboteurs’ turn, follow a fixed sequence based on the Current Report and their automated logic.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Your Turn
1. Use a Subsidy or Investment tile.
2. Move your Scientist.
3. Perform actions (including **Call Security** any number of times).
4. Place Research tokens.

#### Call Security (Free Action)
- Can only be performed during step 3 of your turn, at any Location.
- Pay 1 Voucher (matching Location type or Science) to:
  - Draw 2 cards from the Security Report deck.
  - You now have 3 cards: Current Report + 2 new.
  - Choose 1 to return to the top of the deck, 1 to discard, and 1 to become the new Current Report.

### Saboteurs’ Turn (in order)
1. **Move Saboteur**: Place the Saboteur depicted on the Current Report at the Location shown. If Lativ is shown, move to Lativ’s current Location.
   - Priority for action spaces:
     - Main Locations: leftmost → rightmost → middle (if left/right full).
     - Supply: leftmost unoccupied.
   - If cannot move (full, already there, or Lativ in Office), move to next Main Location (numerically, looping).
2. **Raise Target Value**: If moved to a Main Location, raise Target Value by 1 for each piece (Lativ, your Scientist, other Saboteur) to the left of their action space.
3. **Move Lativ**: If Saboteur moved to Lativ’s Location, move Lativ to the next Location (numeric order). Resolve Lativ’s task (e.g., discard Research token in 2-player mode).
4. **Perform Nefarious Plan**: Based on the Location moved to (see below).
5. **Discard Current Report**.
6. **Reveal New Current Report**: Reveal top card of deck and place face up above Hideout.
7. **Check for Havoc**: If Saboteurs can complete a set of Research tokens:
   - **If Citation space is locked** (unpublished weather):
     - Needs 1 Research token of each color for that weather (3 total).
     - Remove set from game.
     - Place top Level 3 Extreme Weather tile on R&D (cover existing, return markers/Breakthroughs).
     - Discard top Security Report card.
     - Remove Lock token from Citation space.
   - **If Citation space is unlocked** (published weather):
     - Needs 1 Research token of two different colors for that weather (2 total). An Award token can substitute for one.
     - Remove set from game.
     - Choose:
       - Raise Target Value by 5, **or**
       - Discard top Security Report card (only if deck not empty).
   - **Priority for multiple sets**:
     - Prioritize sets that unlock new weather types first.
     - If tied, start with weather on Previous Report and proceed left-to-right (Snow → Rain → Wind → Sun → Fog → Snow).

### Nefarious Plans by Location

#### Location 1: Supply
1. Move Saboteurs’ Initiative marker to the leftmost space. If already there, raise Target Value by 2 instead.
2. Take 2 Chemicals from Supply into Hideout:
   - Select Chemical from section with fewest Supply Vouchers.
   - If tied, take the one they have least of in Hideout.
   - If still tied, take topmost/bottommost based on Priority indicator on Previous Report.

#### Location 2: Government
- If on left symbol ( "&" ), start at step 1. If on right symbol ( “/” ), skip to step 3.
1. Take 1 Chemical from Supply (same method as above).
2. Flip a blue-side-up Subsidy tile based on weather (from Previous Report) and Priority indicator (top/bottom). If none available, flip from next branch.
3. Choose a branch:
   - Ignore branches that are full or where Saboteurs have no matching Chemicals.
   - Choose branch that gains a Research token helping most to complete a set (priority: completes set > matches existing weather > any).
   - If tied, choose first in weather sequence starting from Previous Report.
   - If no branch possible, discard top Security Report card and take 1 Chemical. Skip rest.
4. Place a Bot from Hideout on empty Bot space in chosen branch (matching Chemical). Move matching Chemical from Hideout to Supply (rightmost empty space).
5. Take top/bottom Subsidy tile (by Priority indicator), remove from game, and replace with required Machine Part from reserve.
6. Take Research token from branch to Hideout. If none, raise Target Value by 5.
7. If all Bot spaces now full, Government activates that branch.

#### Government Runs Machine
- When a branch is completed (all Bot spaces full):
  - Raise Target Value by 3 for each Saboteur Bot in the branch.
  - Follow standard Government activation steps (e.g., place Government marker on Extreme Weather tile).

#### Location 3: Lativ's Lab
- If on left symbol, start at step 1. If on right, skip to step 2.
1. Place an Award token in Hideout (Saboteurs never win Nobel).
2. Choose a branch:
   - Ignore full branches, no matching Chemicals, or no matching Experiment tile in display.
   - Choose branch with most Bots (including yours).
   - If tied, choose one helping most to complete a set.
   - If still tied, choose first in weather sequence starting from Previous Report.
   - If no branch possible, discard top Security Report card and take 1 Chemical. Skip rest.
3. Place a Bot from Hideout on top/bottom space (by Priority indicator) in chosen branch (matching Chemical). Move required Chemical from Hideout to rightmost empty Supply space.

#### Location 4: R&D
- If on left symbol, start at step 1. If on right, skip to step 3.
1. Place a Bot from Hideout in Research space:
   - Based on weather and Priority indicator from Previous Report.
   - If no space, go to next branch.
   - No extra cost for bottom space.
2. If have matching Chemical (left of space), move it from Hideout to space. Then:
   - Take Research token from branch to Hideout. If none, raise Target Value by 5 and remove Lock token if able.
3. Choose a branch:
   - Ignore full branches or no matching Chemicals.
   - Choose branch helping most to complete a set.
   - If tied, choose first in weather sequence starting from Previous Report.
   - If no branch possible, discard top Security Report card and take 1 Chemical. Skip rest.
4. Place Bot from Hideout on top/bottom space (by Priority indicator) in chosen branch. Move required Chemical to space left of Bot.
5. Take Research token from branch to Hideout. If none, raise Target Value by 5 and remove Lock token if able.

### Breakthrough
- When you perform a Breakthrough using a Saboteur Bot, raise Target Value by 2 per Saboteur Bot used.
- Saboteurs never perform Breakthroughs.

### Running an Experiment
- If an experiment runs:
  - For each Saboteur Bot in the branch, return it to Hideout and raise Target Value by CP shown on Experiment tile.
  - Saboteurs take 1 Research token (if available) when their turn comes.
- If experiment **does not run** but at least one Saboteur Bot is present:
  - Place a new Extreme Weather tile (as if it ran).
  - Saboteurs do not return Bots.
  - No rewards given.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends immediately in one of three ways:

### Win Immediately: Restore Lightning Technologies
At the beginning of your turn, if:
- Your CP > Target Value.
- You meet conditions for ≥4 Goal tiles.
- ≥2 of your Funding markers are on or beyond the 5th space (0 is starting space).
→ You win.

### Win After Final Scoring: Time Runs Out
If any standard end-game condition occurs:
- You gain Nobel Prize.
- Last Experiment tile placed in display.
- Government Machine completed.
- All R&D Research spaces occupied.
→ Play one more full round, then proceed to Final Scoring.

**Final Scoring**:
1. Resolve any remaining experiments (do not place new Extreme Weather tiles).
2. Raise Target Value by 30.
3. Perform Final Scoring **only for you** (not Saboteurs).
→ If your CP > Target Value, you win.

### Lose Immediately: Saboteurs Succeed
If either occurs:
- At end of your turn, ≥2 Level 3 Extreme Weather tiles are on the board.
- At beginning of Saboteurs’ turn, all Security Report cards are in discard pile.
→ You lose immediately.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can Saboteurs gain Vouchers or Machine Parts?** No. They never spend or gain Vouchers, Machine Parts, Subsidies, or Investment tiles. If they would gain an Investment tile, raise Target Value by 5 instead.
- **Can I look at the Security Report deck?** You may count remaining cards but not look. You may look through the discard pile but not rearrange it.
- **What if both Saboteurs are in the same Location?** Only one moves per turn. The other remains.
- **What if a Location action space is full?** Saboteur moves to next Main Location in order.
- **What if Security Report deck is empty during a “discard” effect?** The effect simply fails; no card is discarded.
