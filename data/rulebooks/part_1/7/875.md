### 1. Lore & Objective
Roads & Boats is a civilization game focused on logistics, transportation, and resource transformation rather than warfare or territorial control. Players build and manage transport networks to produce goods, research technologies, and construct a shared Wonder. The goal is to accumulate the most wealth points by the end of the game through stock, coins, gold, and contributions to the Wonder.

### 2. Components
- **For each player (4 colors):**  
  - 30 wooden transporters (land and water)  
  - 15 player-colored walls (wooden rods)  
  - 40 player-colored wonder bricks  
  - 1 home marker  
  - 1 research table with 8 glass stones  
  - 1 player aid  
- **Shared components:**  
  - 15 neutral walls  
  - 33 neutral (white) wonder bricks  
  - 18 mines and 18 matching bags  
  - 140 hexagonal terrain tiles (woods, pasture, rock, mountains, desert, sea, rivers)  
  - Plastic cover sheet and non-permanent marker  
  - Goods (cardboard squares): trunks, boards, paper, clay, stone, fuel, iron, gold, coins, stock, geese  
  - Buildings (cardboard squares): woodcutter, quarry, sawmill, papermill, clay pit, stone factory, coal burner, mine, mint, stock exchange, raft factory, wagon factory, etc.  
  - Game board with phase chart, sequence chart, temple row, and Wonder track  

### 3. Setup
**Map Creation:**  
- Custom setup: ~10 land tiles per player. Players take turns placing 2 tiles clockwise, ensuring each new tile borders at least one existing tile.  
- Rivers must flow naturally from source to sea; they cannot run off the map.  
- Cover the completed map with the plastic sheet.

**Player Order:**  
- Draw praying figures randomly and place them in order from closest to farthest from the temple.  
- The sequence markers on the sequence chart follow this order (farthest from temple plays first in conflicts).

**Starting Positions:**  
- Players choose starting tiles in order from the sequence chart.  
- Must be at least one empty tile between players.  
- Place home marker on chosen tile.  
- Initial resources: 3 donkeys, 5 boards, 1 stone, 2 geese on home tile.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of four phases, resolved simultaneously unless a conflict arises:

1. **Production Phase:**  
   - **Primary Producers:** Automatically produce goods (e.g., woodcutter → trunks).  
   - **Secondary Producers:** Produce if fed input (e.g., sawmill turns trunks into boards).  
   - **Transporter Factories:** Produce new transporters if input is provided.  
   - **Livestock:** Two donkeys or two geese on an empty pasture tile produce one offspring.  
   - **Research:** 2 geese + 1 paper on a tile with a player’s transporter produces a research point.  
   - **Exchange:** Transporters on the same tile can freely exchange goods.

2. **Movement Phase:**  
   - Each transporter moves once per turn.  
   - **Land Transporters:** Move over roads (donkeys can move 1 tile without roads).  
   - **Water Transporters:** Move on rivers and sea; docking ends movement.  
   - Pick up/drop goods during movement; goods can only be moved by one transporter per player per turn.  
   - Transporters can carry other empty transporters (cannot move after being carried).  
   - Geese follow transporters unless carried.

3. **Building Phase:**  
   - Requires a player’s transporter on the target tile.  
   - **Buildings:** Construct using boards and stones (e.g., quarry: 2 boards, 2 stones).  
   - **Roads:** 1 stone per segment, drawn on plastic sheet.  
   - **Bridges:** 1 stone; connects roads across rivers.  
   - **Walls:** 1 stone; blocks opponents. Can be strengthened (2nd wall: +2 stones, 3rd: +3, etc.).  
   - **Demolish Walls:** 2 sets of boards for 1st wall, +1 set per additional wall layer.  
   - **Mines:** Place 3 gold + 3 iron in bag; produce 1 resource per turn.  
   - **Mine Shafts:** Replenish mine bag (cost: 1 iron, 1 fuel) if "New Shafts" researched.

4. **Wonder Phase:**  
   - Players spend goods from their home tile (with a transporter present) to buy bricks.  
   - Cost: 1st brick = 1 good, 2nd = 2 goods, etc. After 4 rows are filled, cost increases by +1.  
   - Bricks placed leftmost on lowest incomplete row.  
   - After all players, add one neutral brick.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Ownership:** Only transporters and goods on them belong to players; buildings and unattended goods are shared.  
- **Rivers:** Split tiles; require bridges or a boat acting as a ferry to cross.  
- **Transport Limits:** Max 8 transporters per player (max 5 land, 5 water). Excess must be destroyed at a factory.  
- **Research:** Enables building oil rigs, truck/ship factories, and advanced mines (specialized: 4 gold/iron; big: 5 gold + 5 iron).  
- **Mine Output:** Random draw from mine bag; bags can be refilled with research.  
- **Conflict Resolution:** At start of any phase, players may trigger turn order.  
  - Step 1: Starting from closest to temple, players may move their praying figure to the back of the line.  
  - Step 2: Starting from farthest from temple, players choose their turn order position.  
  - Used to resolve disputes over goods or building access.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End Conditions:**  
- Game ends immediately when a brick is placed on the player-count symbol on the Wonder.  
- Also ends after the 33rd neutral brick is placed (33 turns max).

**Scoring:**  
- **Goods on Transporters:**  
  - Gold: 10 points  
  - Coins: 40 points  
  - Stock: 120 points  
- **Wonder Bricks:** Each row scores 10 points, divided equally among players' bricks (rounded down).  
- **Tiebreaker:** Player closest to the temple wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use goods from another player’s transporter?** Only with their permission.  
- **Can I build a road over an opponent’s wall?** Yes, but only they can use it.  
- **What happens if I block a docked boat with a wall?** The boat is immediately moved to the adjacent sea tile.  
- **Can I upgrade a factory I didn’t build?** Yes, if your transporter is present when you research it.  
- **Can geese be left at sea?** No; they must follow a departing transporter or be on an oil rig.
