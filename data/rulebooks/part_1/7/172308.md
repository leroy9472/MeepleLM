### 3. Setup  
1. **Board**: Place board with desired side up. Use purple banner side for full rules with Mountain, Forest, and Hill Tiles.  
2. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player chooses a color and takes:  
     - 10 Role Cards  
     - 2 Pawns (place one in each Castle region)  
     - 1 VP Marker (place on 10 of VP Track)  
     - 1 Potion each of Orange, Green, and Purple

10. **Bewitched Roles (for <5 players)**:  
    - Shuffle 10 Role Cards of an unused color into a deck.  
    - Reveal:  
      - 2 players: 3 Bewitched Roles  
      - 3 players: 2 Bewitched Roles  
      - 4 players: 1 Bewitched Role  
    - These cards cost -3 VP when played.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 7 Rounds. Each Round consists of multiple Turns until all players have played 4 Role Cards.

#### Round Setup  
- Each player secretly selects 4 of their 10 Role Cards to use this round.  
- Reveal new Event Card for the round (except Round 1).  
- Discard previous Bewitched Roles and reveal new ones (if applicable).  

#### Turn Sequence  
1. **Start Player** plays a Role Card face-up and declares **Brave** or **Cowardly**.  
2. **Turn Order (Clockwise)**:  
   - If a player does **not** have the same Role Card, they say "Next".  
   - If a player **does** have it, they **must** play it and choose **Brave** or **Cowardly**.  
     - **Cowardly**: Immediately perform the action, OR  
       - Take an Expansion Card from a face-up pile, OR  
       - Use 1 owned Expansion Card and return it to the bottom of the pile with fewer cards.  
     - **Brave**: Does **not** act yet. The last player to choose Brave this turn will act at the end.  
       - Any earlier Brave declarations are canceled if a later player chooses Brave.  
3. **After All Players Have Acted**:  
   - The **last player** to choose Brave performs their action.  
   - That player becomes the **new Start Player** for the next turn.  
   - If **no one** chose Brave, the original Start Player remains.  
4. **End of Turn**: Played cards go to discard pile (face-up).

- **Expansion Cards**: Can be taken or used during Cowardly turn; returned to smaller pile.  
- **Event Cards**: Apply unique rule per round; some trigger at round end.  
- **Non-Obligatory Actions**: Players may choose not to perform actions even if legal.  
- **No Movement Rules**:  
  - Cannot move into Water or areas with Cloud Tiles.  
  - Pawns start in Castle regions.
