   - 2 players: 36 cards

   - 4 players: 15 cards
   Set aside. Remaining cards form Draw Deck. Reveal 9 cards in 3×3 grid.
3. **Player Setup**:
   - Choose color; place score marker at 0.
   - Place 1 cube on Battery space (center of rondel).
   - Take 5 Transport Tokens, 4 HK$, 5 Secured District Markers (on check-mark spots), 1 "0-6" marker, 1 Locked Marker.

4. **Starting Player**: Randomly choose. Give Start Player Marker. Place 1 cube on any empty location (counter-clockwise order, starting to right of Start Player).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of 8 phases, played in turn order (clockwise):

1. **Roll Resource Dice and Plan Cards** (simultaneous):
   - Roll 3 Resource Dice. Re-roll duplicates until all show different resources. Place on matching rondel segments.
   - Each player places 0–1 card face-down in each unlocked slot (max 3 initially; 4th unlocks later).

2. **Deploy Volunteers and Specialists**:
   - In turn order, reveal face-down cards one at a time.
   - **Volunteer Cards (red, yellow, blue)**: Gain resources matching die color (by number of cubes on card). Use Transport Tokens (1 per space) to shift resource type around rondel.
   - **Specialist Cards (purple)**: Perform actions listed (e.g., gain $, VP, retrieve cards, gain GPS/Batteries). Pay costs as indicated.

3. **Objectives**:
   - Complete goals from Objective Cards, Emergency Plans, or Restore Power goals.
   - Pay costs (resources, $, meet requirements like card sets, Scout Tiles, or connected locations).
   - Take immediate effect (VP, $, cube placement).
   - Move card to destination: hand or check-mark area.
   - **Multi-goal Cards**: Complete goals in any order. Mark completed goals with cube. May complete card early for completion effect, or wait. Only receive bonus if all goals completed.
   - **Restore Power Goals** (on player board):
     - Unlock 4th slot (remove Locked Marker).
     - Unlock 0-6 Marker (place on Phase 8 spot).
     - Each grants 10 VP, usable once per game.

4. **Scout**:
   - Choose a district adjacent to your cube with Scout Tiles.
   - Look at all tiles privately. May collect one.
   - To collect:
     - Choose Simple or Advanced challenge.
     - Form Search Team: 1+ cards from hand (not Doctor).
     - Total Search Icons: from team + check-mark area + face-down Scout Tiles + GPS Tokens (3 each).
     - Must meet or exceed challenge number.
   - If successful: take reward, place tile next to board:
     - **Face-up** if first of that reward type.
     - **Face-down** if duplicate (back-side Search Icon becomes permanent).
     - Randomly send one team card to Hospital.
   - **Probe Challenge**: If taking tile with lowest Simple challenge in district, need only 4 Search Icons. No reward; place tile face-down.

5. **New Objectives**:
   - In turn order, choose to buy one card or pass.
   - Card cost depends on row:
     - 3 cards: $4
     - 2 cards: $3
     - 1 card: $2
   - Must have open Objective spot (max 3).
   - After all players pass consecutively, phase ends.
   - If a row empties, refill with 3 cards from Draw Deck (may trigger End Game).

6. **Clean Up**:
   - Starting player discards rightmost card from each row. Refill empty rows from Draw Deck (may trigger End Game).
   - In turn order:
     - Return all Food/Water cubes to supply.
     - **Food**: 1 cube = $2
     - **Water**: 1 cube = $1, or 2 cubes = 1 GPS Token
     - **Check-mark Bonuses**:
       - "Feed the masses!": 2 Food = 4 VP (any number of times)
       - "Clean the water supply": 2 Water = $7 (any number of times)
   - May discard 1 Objective Card.

7. **Secure Districts**:
   - If a district is now surrounded by one player’s cubes (one per location), it is secured.
   - For each newly secured district:
     - Remove Scout Tiles to box.
     - Each securing player places one Secured District Marker (or cube if none left) in district.
     - All players score VP based on number of cubes surrounding district:
       - 1–2: 2 VP
       - 3: 3 VP
       - 4: 5 VP
       - 5: 7 VP
       - 6: 10 VP
       - 7: 14 VP

8. **Refresh Hand**:
   - In turn order, if hand has ≤4 cards (or ≤6 if 0-6 Marker unlocked), may refresh.
   - Take all cards from slot with most cards (choose if tie) into hand.
   - If refreshed, may perform any number of unlocked Check-mark Actions (once each):
     - From player board (unlocked by placing Secured District Marker)
     - From cards in check-mark area
   - Pass Start Player Marker clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Resource Dice**: Determine available resources each round. Must be unique.
- **Volunteer Cards**: Generate resources. Flexible via Transport Tokens.
- **Specialist Cards**: Enable actions like gaining $, retrieving from Hospital, gaining GPS/Batteries.
- **Batteries**: Wild resource (cost $5). Can substitute any resource except Food/Water during Clean Up.
- **Transport Tokens**: Can be spent to shift resource type (Deployment) or skip locations (cube placement). Buy for 1 VP each (can go negative).
- **Search Icons**: Used in Scout phase. Total from hand, check-mark area, face-down Scout Tiles, GPS Tokens.
- **Check-mark Actions**: Unlocked via securing districts or completing multi-goal cards. Usable during Refresh Hand or with Leader card.
- **Card Sets**: For requirements, cards of specified colors must be in same slot (any order).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **End Game Trigger**: When Draw Deck runs out.
- **Final Round**: Finish current round, then play one more full round. Use Reserve Deck as needed.
- **Final Scoring**:
  1. Sell all resources for $1 each. Convert $5 → 1 VP as often as possible.
  2. Score VP for face-up Scout Tiles:
     - 1–2: 2 VP
     - 3: 3 VP
     - 4: 5 VP
     - 5: 7 VP
     - 6: 10 VP
     - 7+: 14 VP
  3. Score VP for:
     - Each card in hand
     - Each card in bottom slots
     - (Cards in Objective area or Hospital do not score)
- **Winning**: Most VP wins. Tiebreaker: most remaining HK Dollars. If still tied, shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use Battery for Food/Water in Clean Up?**  
  No. Batteries cannot be wasted as Food or Water.
- **Can I use Doctor in Search Team?**  
  No. Doctor has no Search Icons and cannot be used in Scout phase.
- **Can I complete an objective without using its cube placement?**  
  No. All costs and requirements must be met, including cube placement if specified.
- **Can multiple players secure the same district in one round?**  
  Yes. All who complete the surrounding place a marker and unlock a check-mark action. All players score VP based on surrounding cubes.
- **Can I refresh hand with 5 cards if 0-6 is unlocked?**  
  Yes. Unlocking 0-6 allows refresh with 6 or fewer cards.
- **Do face-down Scout Tiles count toward collection scoring?**  
  No. Only face-up Scout Tiles count for final scoring.
- **Can I use Check-mark Actions without refreshing?**  
  Only if using Leader card during Deployment. Otherwise, must refresh to use.
