### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each mission consists of four phases:

#### 1. Preparation
- The Mission Leader chooses the **Intensity** (number of cards to deal):
  - Minimum 3 in the first mission.
  - Minimum 1 in all subsequent missions.
- Cards are drawn from the Trials pile and dealt face down, one at a time, starting with the Mission Leader.
- If the Trials pile runs out, stop dealing—some players may have fewer cards.

#### 2. The Mission
Players take turns clockwise, starting with the Mission Leader. On their turn, a player (who hasn’t withdrawn) chooses **one** action:

- **Play a Trial Card**:
  - Place Threat cards in No Man’s Land.
  - Place Hard Knock cards in front of their Grizzled.
  - If the card has a **Trap**, draw and play one additional card immediately. If that card has a Trap, ignore it.
- **Use a Good Luck Charm**:
  - Only if their Grizzled card is face up.
  - Discard **one** Threat card from No Man’s Land matching their charm.
  - Flip their Grizzled card face down.
- **Make a Speech**:
  - Only if they possess a Speech token.
  - Announce one Threat type (e.g., "Shells").
  - All non-withdrawn players may discard **one** card (Threat or Hard Knock) with that Threat.
  - Remove the Speech token from the game.
- **Withdraw and Play a Support Tile**:
  - Announce withdrawal.
  - Secretly choose one of their Support tiles and place it face down on their Grizzled card.
  - Place hand face down on their character card (cards are saved for next mission).
  - Once withdrawn, their Hard Knocks no longer affect the mission.

**End of Mission Triggers**:
- **Success**: All players have withdrawn. Discard all cards in No Man’s Land.
- **Failure**: 3 identical Threats are present in No Man’s Land **and/or** non-withdrawn players’ Hard Knocks. Shuffle No Man’s Land cards back into the Trials pile.

> Unplayed cards remain in hand. Hard Knocks stay in play.

#### 3. Support
- All players reveal their Support tiles and give them to the indicated player.
- Count Support received:
  - If **one player received more** than all others:
    - **Success**: May discard 2 Hard Knocks **or** flip their Grizzled card face up (recover charm).
    - **Failure**: May discard 1 Hard Knock.
  - If tied, no benefit is granted.
- Players keep received Support tiles for future use.
- **Defeat Check**: If any player has 4 or more Hard Knocks (e.g., Wounded counts as 2), the game ends in defeat.

#### 4. Morale Drop
- Count total cards remaining in players’ hands.
- Move that many cards (minimum 3) from the Morale pile to the Trials pile.
- **Defeat Check**: If the Monument card is revealed, the game ends in defeat.
- Pass the Mission Leader token clockwise.
- The outgoing Mission Leader takes a Speech token if any remain.

A new mission begins.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Threats
Six types:
- **Night**, **Rain**, **Snow** (weather)
- **Mask** (gas), **Shell**, **Whistle** (enemy assault)

Each Threat appears on 14 cards. Cards may show multiple Threats.

#### Hard Knocks
- 19 cards representing personal trauma.
- Types include:
  - **Phobias** (Shell Shock, Fear of Gas, etc.)
  - **Trauma** (e.g., Trauma of Rain, Trauma of Night)
  - **Status Effects** (e.g., Wounded, Clumsy, Mute)
- Played to a player’s area when drawn or triggered.
- Some restrict actions (e.g., Entête prevents withdrawal with 2+ cards).

**Merry Christmas**: One-time use. Discard to remove **one** Hard Knock card.

#### Support Tiles
- Indicate direction of support:
  - ▶: next player to the right
  - ◀: next player to the left
  - ▶▶: second player to the right
  - ◀◀: second player to the left
- Secretly chosen when withdrawing.
- Received tiles are kept permanently.

#### Speech Tokens
- Allow group discard of a specific Threat.
- Cannot benefit withdrawn players.
- Removed from game after use (except in 2-player with Chaplain).

#### 2-Player Variant (Chaplain)
- Add a virtual player: **The Chaplain**.
- He receives 3 Support tiles (excluding ◀◀ and ▶▶).
- At mission start, he randomly selects and plays a Support tile, then withdraws.
- Speech tokens return to supply after use.
- Trials pile starts with 20 cards; Morale pile with 39.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

- **Victory**: Peace card visible **and** all players have no cards in hand.
- **Defeat**:
  - Any player has 4 or more Hard Knocks.
  - Monument card is revealed.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I withdraw with no cards?** Yes—even if a Hard Knock would prevent it.
- **Can I withdraw with no Support tiles?** Yes—just place hand face down.
- **Trap on a Hard Knock?** Draw and play the card, but do not trigger a second Trap.
- **Conflict between Hard Knocks?**
  - On same player: older card takes priority.
  - On different players: current player’s Hard Knocks apply first.
- **Clumsy**: When withdrawing, draw and play one card (Trap not activated).
- **Wounded**: Counts as **2 Hard Knocks** for defeat, but only **1** to discard when receiving support.
- **Mute**: Cannot make speeches, but can still support.
- **Tyrannical**: Prevents passing of Mission Leader token—no new speeches gained.
- **Frantic**: At mission start, draws 2 extra cards after dealing.
- **Fragile**: Others cannot withdraw while they have cards in hand.
- **Demoralised**: During Morale Drop, count hand size +1 (minimum 4 cards moved).
- **Panique**: Support tile is chosen randomly.
- **Etourdi**: When withdrawing, remove one Support tile from the game permanently.
