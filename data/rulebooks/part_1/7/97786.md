## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Small World Underground*, players lead fantastical races through conquest and decline across a dynamic underground map. The goal is to amass the most Victory coins by strategically occupying regions, leveraging unique race abilities and special powers, and managing your empire's rise and fall over a fixed number of turns.

### 2. Components
- Race Banners (with token counts)
- Special Power Badges
- Race Tokens (in player colors)
- Storage Tray
- Game Turn Marker and Track
- Victory Coins
- Map with various terrain types (Mines, Mudpools, Chasms, Rivers, etc.)
- Unique markers: Great Ancient, Volcano, Silver Hammers, Mystic Crystals, Mushroom Armor, Queen, Ghost, etc.
- Righteous Relics and Popular Places tokens
- Reinforcement Die

### 3. Setup
1. Select the appropriate map for player count; place the Game Turn marker on Round 1.
2. Place Mountains, Black Mountains, and Monster tokens as indicated.
3. Shuffle Race Banners and Special Power Badges; lay out 6 Race/Power combos face-up. Place remaining combos in a stack beneath.
4. Each player starts with 5 Victory coins.
5. Determine starting player (e.g., "most pointed ears").
6. Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn follows this sequence:
1. **Active Phase**: Choose to either:
   - **Expand**: Use your active race to conquer new regions.
   - **Go Into Decline**: Retire your current race and select a new Race/Power combo.
2. **Redeployment**: Reorganize your tokens, leaving at least one per occupied region.
3. **Scoring**: Collect 1 Victory coin per occupied region plus bonuses from race, powers, relics, and places.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Conquest Rules
- First conquest must be from the map edge (including river ends).
- Subsequent conquests must be adjacent unless modified by race/power.
- Cost to conquer: 2 + 1 per defender token or obstacle (Lost Tribes, Monster, etc.).
- River regions cost only 1 token to conquer but must be emptied during redeployment unless race allows otherwise (e.g., Kraken).
