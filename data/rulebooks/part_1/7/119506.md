### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in the following phases:

#### 1. Slave Catcher Phase  
- Roll the die to determine movement:  
  - Each number corresponds to a Slave Catcher color/path.  
  - That Slave Catcher moves **one space forward** along its path.  
  - If the **Walking Slave symbol** is rolled, **no Slave Catcher moves**.

> **Note:** If a Slave Catcher enters a space with a slave, that slave is **captured** (see Capturing Slaves below).

#### 2. Planning Phase  
- Players may **buy up to 2 tokens** (Conductor, Support, or Fundraising).  
- Only tokens from the **currently active Period Column** are available.  
- **Support Tokens cost $10** in Period 1 (1800–1839), prices vary in later periods.  
- **Fundraising Tokens are free** during Planning Phase.  
- **Unlock next Period** only after **all Support Tokens** in current Period are purchased.

#### 3. Action Phase (clockwise from Lead Player)  
Each player may perform **up to five actions** in any order:  
1. **Play a Conductor and/or Fundraising Token** (maximum 2 tokens per turn).  
2. **Buy and resolve one Abolitionist Card** from the Abolitionist Queue.  
3. **Gain the benefit of your Role Card**.  
4. **Use your Role Card’s one-time Special Ability**.  
5. **Pass** – collect $3 (Period 1), $4 (Period 2), or $5 (Period 3).

> **Notes:**  
> - You may pass at any time during your turn to take the cash instead of further actions.  
> - You may play **two tokens**, but not more.  
> - Tokens are **removed from the game** after use, **except** the last grey Conductor Token, which returns to the board for repurchase.

#### 4. Slave Market Phase  
- Move **3 different slaves**, each **one space**, from plantations toward freedom.  
  - Use **Conductor Tokens** (each allows one movement action).  
  - A single slave **cannot be moved twice by the same Conductor Token**, but may be moved multiple times using different tokens, cards, or abilities.  
- Slaves can move along **any path**, regardless of color.  
- If a slave ends movement on a space with **$**, collect that amount from the bank.  
- After moving, **check for Slave Catcher triggers**:  
  - If a slave ends on a space connected to a Slave Catcher path, that Slave Catcher moves **one space closer**.

> **Capturing Slaves:**  
> - If a Slave Catcher ends its movement on a space with a slave, the slave is **captured**.  
> - Captured slaves are returned to the **Slave Market Cards**, starting from the **bottom card** and working upward.  
> - If a Slave Market Card is full, slaves overflow to the next card up.  
> - If **no space remains** on any Slave Market Card, place the slave on the **Slave Lost Track**.  
> - If the **Slave Lost Track fills up and another slave must be added, the game is lost immediately**.

#### 5. Abolitionist Queue Maintenance  
- After an Abolitionist Card is purchased or resolved:  
  - **Remove it from the Queue**.  
  - **Slide remaining cards to the right**.  
  - **Draw a new card** from the current Period Deck to refill the leftmost empty space.  
- **For 1–2 players:** Discard the **two rightmost cards** in the Queue after each round.

#### 6. End of Round  
- Check victory conditions:  
  - Have all **Support Tokens** been purchased?  
  - Have enough **slaves reached Canada**?  
- If yes to both, **immediate victory**.  
- If not, and it is **end of Round 8**, the game is lost.  
- Otherwise, pass the **Player Lantern Token** clockwise and begin a new round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Conductor Tokens  
- Allow movement of slaves.  
- Each use permits **one movement action** (move one or more slaves one space each, depending on token).  
- Colored tokens are **removed after use**.  
- The **last grey Conductor Token** returns to the board after use.

#### Abolitionist Cards  
- Resolved **immediately** when purchased.  
- **Normal cards**: discarded after use.  
- **Reserve Cards (grey background)**: kept on player’s mat for later use (max one per player).  
- Cost varies by card and position in Queue.  
- Can be purchased **only during Action Phase** (unless otherwise stated).

#### Fundraising Tokens  
- Provide passive income:  
  - **Period 1 & 2 Fundraising Tokens**: Gain $1 for **each slave on a Green space**.  
  - **Period 3 Fundraising Tokens**: Gain $1 for **each slave on a Blue space**.  
- Collected during Action Phase.

#### Opposition Cards  
- Remain in the Abolitionist Queue and **affect gameplay while present**.  
- Examples:  
  - **Fugitive Slave Act**: Reduce movement from tokens by 1 slave (e.g., "move 3 slaves" becomes "move 2").  
  - **Pennsylvania Hall**: Prevent buying Support Tokens in Planning Phase (still allowed in Action Phase).  
  - **Tough Crossing**: Cannot move slaves to Canada using Conductor Tokens.  
  - **U.S. Marshals**: When triggered, all Slave Catchers return to start; any slaves on those spaces are captured.

#### Stretch Cards (Optional)  
- Can **replace** base game cards (not added on top).  
- Balance:  
  - Period 1: 13 cards (9 for 1–2 players)  
  - Period 2: 17 cards (13 for 1–2 players)  
  - Period 3: 10 cards (all player counts)  
- Negative Cards can be added to the pool for random selection during setup.
