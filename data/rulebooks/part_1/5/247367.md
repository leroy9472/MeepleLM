## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The game simulates strategic warfare across three domains—Air, Land, and Sea. The goal is to be the first player to reach 12 Victory Points (VPs) by winning battles through superior theater control or forcing opponents to withdraw.

2. Components  
- 3 Theater Boards (Air, Land, Sea)  
- 18 Battle Cards (6 per type: Air, Land, Sea)  
- 2 Supreme Commander Cards (determine turn order and VP rewards)  
- 14 Score Markers (2 sixes, 6 threes, 6 ones)  
- Supply Tokens (used for strength boosts)  

3. Setup  
1. Randomly place the 3 theater boards in a row between players.  
2. Shuffle the 2 Supreme Commander cards and deal 1 facedown to each player. Reveal them; the player with the 1st Player card takes the first turn.  
3. Shuffle the 18 matching battle cards and deal 6 to each player. Keep hands secret.  
4. Place the remaining cards aside as a deck.  
5. Place all supply tokens in a pile near the play area.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Players alternate turns starting with the 1st Player.  
- On your turn, choose one of three actions: Deploy, Improvise, or Withdraw.  
- Continue until one player withdraws or both have played all 6 cards.  
- Resolve battle outcome and score VPs.  
- Prepare for next battle by rotating theaters, swapping Supreme Commander cards, and redealing hands.  
- Check for victory after each battle.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Theaters: Three columns (Air, Land, Sea). Adjacent theaters are side-by-side; no wraparound.  
- Cards: Each has Strength (large number), Type (color/icon), and Tactical Ability (Instant or Ongoing).  
- Deployment:  
  - Deploy: Play a card faceup to its matching theater. Must cover previous cards on your side. Triggers Tactical Ability immediately.  
  - Improvise: Play a card facedown to any theater. Counts as Strength 2, no ability.  
  - Withdraw: End the battle; opponent wins.  
- Covered/Uncovered: Newly played cards cover older ones. Covered cards still contribute strength and ongoing abilities.  
- Tactical Abilities:  
  - Instant: Triggers when card is played faceup or flipped faceup. Resolves fully even if card is flipped facedown mid-resolution.  
  - Ongoing: Active only while card is faceup.  
- Key Actions:  
  - Flip: Turn a card faceup or facedown. Can affect own or opponent’s cards unless specified.  
  - Move: Relocate a card to another theater (same side). Place on top.  
  - Destroy: Remove card to bottom of deck. If destroyed upon play, ability does not trigger.  
  - Play: Placing a card from hand into a theater. Different from Move or Flip.  
- Non-Matching Theaters: Cards may end up in incorrect theaters via abilities. No penalty; strength still counts.  
- Supply Tokens: Worth +1 strength. Placed in theaters via card effects.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- If neither player withdraws: Winner (controls most theaters) scores 6 VPs.  
- If a player withdraws: Winner scores VPs based on number of cards left in withdrawing player’s hand, per the Supreme Commander card chart.  
- Tie in theater control: 1st Player wins the tie. Empty theater: 1st Player controls it.  
- After scoring, check for 12 VPs. First to 12 wins.  
- Optional: Play to 18 VPs for a longer game.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I examine my facedown cards? Yes.  
- Can I examine opponent’s facedown cards? No.  
- What happens if multiple instant abilities trigger? Resolve in order triggered; fully resolve each before next.  
- Does “play” include moving or flipping? No. Move and Flip are distinct.  
- If a card is destroyed immediately after being played (e.g., Blockade), does its ability trigger? No.  
- Can ongoing abilities affect the card itself? Yes, unless stated otherwise.  
- “You” in abilities refers to the card’s owner.  
- If a card ability contradicts general rules, the card ability takes precedence.  
- If part of an ability is impossible, skip that part; rest resolves.  
- Cards played via abilities follow normal deployment rules unless stated otherwise.
