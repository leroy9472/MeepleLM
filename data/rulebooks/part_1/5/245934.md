### 3. Setup  

1. **Game Board**: Place in center of table.  
2. **Player Boards**:  
   - Each player takes 4 random Frame Parts and assembles them into a square.  
   - Place their City District Board inside the frame with the shovel handle pointing to the top right.  
   - Place 9 Writ (Banderole) tokens on the 9 designated spaces on the board.  
   - Place Resource Board next to City District Board.  
   - Choose a color and take 1 Patrician and 5 Marker Discs of that color.  

3. **Patrician Placement**:  
   - Each player places their Patrician on any unoccupied blue rectangle space on the central Game Board. Multiple meeples may occupy the same space.  

4. **Forum Cards**:  
   - Separate the 60 Forum Cards into A, B, C, D piles by back symbol. Shuffle each pile.  
   - Draw and shuffle the following for placement:  
     - 2 players: 2A + 2B + 2C + 2D → 8 cards  
     - 3 players: 2A + 3B + 2C + 3D → 10 cards  
     - 4 players: 3A + 3B + 2C + 4D → 12 cards  
   - Shuffle the selected cards and place them face-up on the Forum spaces of the Game Board:  
     - 2 players: Leave 4 corners empty  
     - 3 players: Leave 2 opposing corners empty  
     - 4 players: Fill all 12 spaces  

5. **Other Components**:  
   - Shuffle Fountain Cards and place face-down beside board.  
   - Sort VP Cards into 5 face-up piles by value.

     - Dark Green (black back): Shuffle and place 1 tile face-up on each of the 11 bottom-margin spaces.  
   - Place Goods, Coins, and Bread in supply piles.  

6. **Starting Player**:  
   - Give Starting Player Token to youngest player (or player born furthest from 1 BC).  
   - That player places one Marker Disc on space 0 of the Prestige Track (top of board).  
   - Other players place their Marker Discs on top in clockwise order.  

7. **Starting Victory Points**:  
   - 2 players: P1 = 8 VP, P2 = 9 VP

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

The game consists of **4 Phases**, each with **7 Rounds** of tile selection, followed by a **Forum Phase** (scoring). After the 4th Forum Phase, final scoring occurs.

#### Round Structure (per player):  
1. **Move Patrician**:  
   - Must move to one of the two adjacent blue rectangle spaces.  
   - May pay **1 Bread** to stay in place or move to **any** space.  
   - Multiple Patricians may occupy the same space.  
   - If the new space has no Building Tiles, move again in the same direction until landing on a space with tiles.  

2. **Take Building Tile**:  
   - Take 1 tile from the Blueprint space adjacent to the Patrician’s current space.  

3. **Place Tile**:  
   - First tile must go on the **Shovel space**.  
   - All subsequent tiles must be placed **orthogonally adjacent** to an existing tile.  
   - Tiles may be rotated but must **match all adjacent edges** (e.g., pond to pond, villa to villa, grass to grass).  
   - Frame counts as **grass**, so only tiles with grass edges may be placed adjacent to it.  

4. **Resolve Tile Effects**:  
   - **Covering a Writ**: Remove Writ token and advance Marker Disc **1 space** on Prestige Track (stack on top if occupied).  
   - **Completing a Landscape (2–4 tiles)**: Gain **(number of tiles – 1)** of the corresponding resource (Fish, Herbs, Grapes, Chickens).  
   - **Completing a Dwelling (2 halves)**: Gain reward based on roof color:  
     - **Merchant (Gold)**: Return all Goods to supply; gain 1 + 1 Coin per Good returned.  
     - **Granary (Brown)**: Gain 2 Bread.  
     - **Administration (Silver)**: Advance 2 spaces on Prestige Track. If blocked, gain 1 VP per unadvanced space.  
     - **Craftsman (Green)**: Take **1 Dark Green tile** from bottom of board and place immediately (triggering further effects if applicable).  
   - **Single-Tile Buildings**:  
     - **Market**: Gain 1 Coin.  
     - **Bakery**: Gain 1 Bread.  
     - **Fountain**: Draw top 2 Fountain Cards; choose 1 to keep, return 1 to bottom of deck. (On future draws, you may return any card from your stack.)  
   - **Villas**: No immediate reward. Score at end of game based on chimney count.  

5. **Tile Removal (2- & 3-player games only)**:  
   - 2 players: After 2nd tile taken from a Blueprint, discard remaining 2 tiles.  
   - 3 players: After 3rd tile taken, discard the last tile.  

Play proceeds clockwise until all 28 tiles are taken.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Forum Phase (after each of 4 Phases):  
1. **Order of Play**:  
   - Players act in order of **Prestige Track position**, highest first.  
   - Ties: Player with disc on **top** of stack goes first.  

2. **Scoring Action**:  
   - On turn, player selects **two adjacent Forum Cards** with an **empty circle between them**.  
   - Places one Marker Disc on that circle, **locking that card pair** for the rest of the game.  
   - May choose the **order** in which to resolve the two cards (enabling chaining rewards).  

3. **Card Types**:  
   - **A & B Cards (Red Stripe)**: Require **spending** resources.  
     - A: Same type of goods (e.g., 3 Fish)  
     - B: Mixed goods (e.g., 1 Fish, 1 Herb, 1 Grape)  
     - Goods may be replaced with **Coins**.  
   - **C & D Cards (Green Stripe)**: Require **owning** features.  
     - C: Related to **Villas** (chimneys or completed villas)  
     - D: Related to **Landscapes, Dwellings, Markets, Bakeries, Fountains**  
   - For **any card**, may pay **3 Bread** to fulfill requirement **once**.  
   - May fulfill a card **multiple times** (e.g., if you have 6 Fish and card needs 2, you score 3 times).  

4. **Penalty**:  
   - If cannot meet **either** card’s requirement: **Lose 4 VP**  
   - If cannot meet **both**: **Lose 8 VP total**  

5. **Rewards**:  
   - VP, Coins, Bread, or Prestige Track advancement — all gained immediately.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

After the **4th Forum Phase**, final scoring occurs:

1. **Remaining Items**:  
   - Sum all Goods, Coins, Bread, and unused face-down Building Tiles.  
   - Divide by **2**, round **down** → gain that many VP.  

2. **Prestige Track**:  
   - Gain VP equal to current space number (e.g., space 10 = 10 VP).  

3. **Frame Achievements**:  
   - Each of 4 Frame Parts has **2 goals** (8 total).  
   - Draw a straight line from each arrow across the board.  
   - If the line passes through **at least one completed** building/landscape of the required type, score the indicated VP.  
   - **Incomplete** or **unmatched** types do **not** count.  
   - Each goal scored **once**.  

4. **Fountain Cards**:  
   - Reveal all kept Fountain Cards.  
   - Gain VP for **each completed** building/landscape shown (e.g., “1 VP per completed Garden”).  
   - Multiple cards of same type → score each.  

5. **Villas**:  
   - For **each completed Villa**, count **chimneys** and score VP based on total:  
     - 2 chimneys: 1 VP  
     - 3 chimneys: 3 VP  
     - 4 chimneys: 4 VP  
     - 5 chimneys: 7 VP  
     - 6+ chimneys: 10 VP  
   - **Incomplete villas** score **nothing**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

- **Can I skip placing a tile?**  
  Yes. If unable or unwilling to place, place tile **face-down** on Resource Board storage — it stays there permanently.  

- **Can I place a tile that doesn’t complete a match?**  
  No. All edges must match adjacent tiles or the frame (which counts as grass).  

- **Do I have to move my Patrician?**  
  Yes, unless you pay **1 Bread** to stay or teleport.  

- **Can I use Bread earned during Forum Phase on the same turn?**  
  Yes. Rewards are immediate and can be used for second card.  

- **Can I use Coins on C/D Cards?**  
  No. Coins only substitute for **goods** on A/B Cards.  

- **Can I score the same Forum Card twice?**  
  Only if paired with a **different card** in a later phase. The **pair** is blocked, not the individual card.  

- **Tiebreaker**:  
  - Most VP wins.  
  - Tie: Most **Writs (Banderoles)** remaining on board.  
  - Still tied: Player on **lowest** space of Prestige Track wins.
