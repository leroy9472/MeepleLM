# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The goal of Civilization is to be the first player to reach the end of the Progress Chart (AST). Advancement requires accumulating points through cities, civilization cards, and resources, while managing population, trade, and calamities. Players represent ancient civilizations competing through expansion, technology, and strategy.

## 2. Components
- Game board with zones, floodplains, volcanoes, and Progress Chart (AST)
- Population tokens (round pieces, used for units, treasury, and stock)
- City markers (square pieces)
- Ships (4 per player)
- Trade cards (numbered 1–9, with commodity types)
- Calamity cards (level 2–9, red or black back)
- Civilization (Civ) cards
- Player mats (for tracking stock, treasury, census)
- Progress and census markers

## 3. Setup
- **Player Count & Starting Positions**:
  - 2 players: Choose 2 of: Asia/Hattusas, Crete/Knossos, Thrace/Odessus
  - 3 players: Add Illyria (north edge, zone 5)
  - 4 players: Add Assyria (NE corner, zone 2), Babylon/Susa
  - 5–7 players: Add Egypt/Hieraconopolis, Illyria, Italy/Tarquinii, Thrace (north edge, zone 3)
- **Mysticism Cards**: 1 for 2–3 players, 2 for 4–7 players
- **Starting Tokens**: Each player places 1 token at their starting zone
- **Trade Cards**: Shuffle stacks 1–2 and deal one card from each stack per player; choose nation in ascending order of card value
- **Initial Setup**: Place city marker on AST start position

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round follows this sequence:

1. **Taxes (E1)**: Pay 2 tokens per city from Stock to Treasury. If unable, Revolt occurs: player with most Stock takes the city.
2. **Population Expansion (E2)**: Add 1 token to zones with 1 token; add 2 to zones with 2+.
3. **Census (E3)**: Update population count; move census marker.
4. **Ships (E4)**: Spend 1 token to maintain, 2 to build. Levy from Treasury or map.
5. **Movement (E5)**: In Census Order (most tokens first). Units move 1 land zone or on/off ships. Ships move 4 zones (5 with Cloth Making), carry 5 tokens, enter open sea with Astronomy.
6. **Conflict (E6)**:
   - If zone exceeds population limit, attrition: smallest force removes first (simultaneous if tie).
   - City attack: 7 attackers needed (8 if defender has Engineering). Defender eliminated → city becomes 6 tokens.
   - Multiple attackers: fight each other first.
7. **Build Cities (E7)**:
   - 6 tokens on city site (white/black square), 12 otherwise.
   - Max 9 cities per player.
   - Remove surplus population after building.
8. **Acquire Trade Cards (E8)**:
   - Order: Fewest cities first, then reverse AST.
   - Take 1 card per city from each stack (stack 1 first).
   - Buy Gold (level 9 card) for 18 Treasury tokens.
   - Red calamity cards must be revealed.
9. **Trade (E9)**:
   - Simultaneous, face-down trades between two players.
   - Minimum 3 cards traded.
   - Declare: number of cards, total value, one card type.
   - Can trade level 6–9 calamities; black calamities received must be resolved this round.
10. **Acquire Civilization Cards (E10)**:
    - Order: Reverse AST.
    - Pay with trade cards (returned to stack bottoms) and Treasury tokens (exact change).
    - Max 11 Civ cards; cannot use new card credits in same turn.
    - Credit system: Arts → Law, Crafts → Democracy, Science → Philosophy.
11. **Resolve Calamities (E11)**:
    - Resolve in ascending order (level 2 to 9).
    - Max 2 active calamities per player.
    - Effects:
      - **Volcano/Earthquake (2)**: Eliminate all units in volcano zone; if none, reduce one city and one adjacent opponent city.
      - **Famine (3)**: Lose 9 units; order others to lose up to 20 total (max 11 per player). Pottery reduces loss by 4 per Grain card.
      - **Civil War (4)**: Requires ≥35 units. Split 35: player selects 15, nominee selects 20. Player chooses side. Philosophy: only 15 split, chosen by player with most Stock. Democracy: 45 split (15+30).
      - **Flood (5)**: Lose 17 units on floodplain; remove up to 10 from opponents on same plain. Engineering limits loss to 7.
      - **Epidemic (6)**: Lose 16 units; order others to lose up to 25 total (max 10 per player). Must leave 1 unit per zone. Medicine: lose 11, others lose max 5.
      - **Civil Disorder (7)**: Reduce cities beyond 4. Law: up to 5. Democracy: up to 6.
      - **Iconoclasm & Heresy (8)**: Reduce 4 cities; may reduce 2 opponent cities. Law: reduce 3 (max 1 opponent). Philosophy: reduce 2 (opponents immune).

12. **Return Excess Cards (E12)**: Keep max 6 trade/calamity cards. Return excess to stack bottoms.
13. **Alter AST (E13)**:
    - Move marker one step forward if conditions met:
      - Early Bronze: 2 cities
      - Late Bronze: 3 Civ card colors
      - Early Iron: 7 Civ cards
      - Late Iron: 1000+ points (Civ cards + Treasury + Trade cards)
    - If no cities, move marker back one step.
    - If below threshold in Late Iron, move back.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Unit Points (UP)**: Token = 1 UP, City = 5 UP (except Epidemic: 4 UP)
- **Orders**:
  - **AST Order**: Fixed top-to-bottom
  - **Census Order**: Most tokens to least (AST breaks ties)
  - **Fewest Cities**: Least to most (reverse AST breaks ties)
- **Support**: 2 tokens required per city. Unsupported cities reduced after conflicts.
- **Agriculture**: +1 population limit in occupied zones (not during conflict).
- **Special Abilities**:
  - **Cloth Making**: Ships move 5 zones
  - **Astronomy**: Ships cross open sea
  - **Metal Working**: Opponent removes first in conflict (if no tie)
  - **Engineering**: +1 flood protection; requires 8 attackers
  - **Medicine**: Reduces Epidemic damage
  - **Law/Democracy/Philosophy**: Reduce effects of Civil Disorder, Iconoclasm, Civil War

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: First player to reach the final circle on the AST.
- **Tiebreaker**: Total points = Civilization card values + Treasury tokens + Trade card values.
- **Scoring Components**:
  - Civilization cards: face value
  - Treasury: 1 per token
  - Trade cards: sum of card values

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Token Shortage**: Use substitutes. If no tokens for city reduction, eliminate city.
- **Revolt with No Eliminated Player**: Player with most Stock after taxes takes city.
- **Simultaneous Conflict**: All players with equal forces remove tokens at once.
- **Calamity Trading**: Black calamities received in trade must be resolved; cannot be re-traded.
- **Civ Card Limits**: Max 11 cards; excess returned during E12.
- **Movement with Ships**: Units may board, move, and disembark in same turn; ships may retrace path.
- **Census Timing**: Flip all tokens to colored side; update chart before movement.
