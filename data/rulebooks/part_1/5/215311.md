3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center. Choose one of the two tracks.  
2. Give each player a score sheet and writing tool.  
3. Shuffle the 6 Speed-8 cards and 6 Power cards separately into face-down piles.  
4. Shuffle the 42 regular speed cards and deal them equally:  
   - 2 players: 21 each  
   - 3 players: 14 each  
   - 4 players: 10 each (2 left over, return to box)  
   - 5 players: 8 each (2 left over, return to box)  
   - 6 players: 7 each  
5. Place driver plaques beside the board.  
6. Randomly place all 6 cars on the starting grid (6-space staggered formation).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Auction Phase**:  
   - Reveal the top Speed-8 and Power card.  
   - Each player secretly selects a speed card from hand as a bid (value in $M = number on matching color).  
   - Reveal all bids. Highest value wins. Tiebreakers:  
     - More cars on the bid card  
     - No wild symbol (white car)  
   - Winner:  
     - Records bid amount on score sheet  
     - Takes matching driver plaque and Speed-8 card  
     - Places Power card face up in front of them  
   - Bid cards return to owners’ hands.  
   - Repeat until all cars are auctioned.  
   - Players with multiple Power cards choose one to keep; return others.  

2. **Race Phase**:  
   - Player controlling the car in pole position (1st place) starts.  
   - Turns proceed clockwise.  
   - On a turn, a player plays one speed card from hand or uses a Speed-8 card.  
   - Move each car on the card the number of spaces shown.  
   - Order of movement: top to bottom on card, unless player has Tricky power.  
   - After resolution, discard regular speed cards. Speed-8 cards are used once and set aside.  
   - Players with no cards and all cars finished discard remaining Speed-8 cards and exit race.  

3. **Betting Phase**:  
   - Betting occurs when any car first crosses one of three betting lines.  
   - After movement resolves, each player secretly bets on which car will finish in 1st place.  
   - Bets are recorded on score sheet.  
   - Players may bet on any car, including their own. Multiple bets on same car allowed.  

4. **Finishing the Race**:  
   - When a car crosses the finish line, place it in the winner’s space by the track.  
   - If all of a player’s cars finish, they discard remaining cards and take no further turns.  
   - If cards run out before all cars finish, remaining cars stay in place.  
   - Final order: cars on track are ranked by position; ties broken by inside lane advantage.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Speed Cards**: Move cars forward (straight or diagonal) the number of spaces indicated. Full movement required if possible.  
- **Wilds (White Cars)**: Can represent any car color not already on the card.  
  - Exception: Unpredictable power allows wild to represent a color already on the card.  
  - Two wilds must target different cars.  
- **Power Cards**: Override standard rules:  
  - **Aggressive**: +1 movement to your car if it’s first on the card.  
  - **Cunning**: You control movement of your cars, even on others’ turns.  
  - **Determined**: If movement is only through rectangular spaces, gain +2 movement immediately.  
  - **Strategic**: Skip moving one car on the played card.  
  - **Tricky**: Choose order of car movement.  
  - **Unpredictable**: Wilds can target cars of a color already on the card.  
- **Lane Movement**:  
  - Forward movement only. Diagonal moves allowed if new space is ahead.  
  - Cars cannot move through others. Diagonal passage between two adjacent cars allowed.  
  - Cars may be deliberately jammed.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
1. **Car Payouts**:  
   - 1st: $6M | 2nd: $4M | 3rd: $2M | 4th–6th: $0  
   - Only cars that cross finish line earn payout.  
2. **Betting Payouts**:  
   - Based on when bet was placed and final position:  
     - Bet 1: 1st = $6M, 2nd = $4M, 3rd = $2M  
     - Bet 2: 1st = $4M, 2nd = $2M  
     - Bet 3: 1st = $2M  
3. **Net Winnings**:  
   - Sum car payouts and betting winnings.  
   - Subtract total auction bids.  
   - Highest net profit wins.  
   - Tiebreaker: Higher-finishing car wins.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **No Bids on a Car**: Set aside. At auction end, players without cars bid on set-aside cards. If still no bids, car races unowned (can still be bet on).  
- **No Matching Color to Bid**: Use a wild card to bid. Value = number on card.  
- **All Players Must Own a Car**: When # remaining cars = # players without cars, only those players may bid.  
- **Two-Player Variant**:  
  - Speed-8 cards remain face up.  
  - Form individual draw piles; draw 7-card hands.  
  - Play card from hand or use Speed-8; draw after playing from hand.  
- **Timely Betting Variant**:  
  - Players draw reduced hands based on player count.  
  - Speed-8 cards remain face up.  
  - Draw replacement after playing from hand.  
  - Betting restriction: Bet on Bet 1 → cannot bet on Bet 2 or 3. Skip Bet 1 → may bet on both Bet 2 and 3.  
- **War of Whispers Variant**:  
  - No ownership. Players predict final order at each betting line.  
  - After Bet 1, may swap two predictions. Repeat at Bet 2 and Bet 3.  
  - Score 1 point per correct position. Bonus: 6/3/1 pts for perfect prediction at Bet 1/2/3.  
  - Winner: Most points. Tiebreak: Position of car on player’s driver plaque.  
- **Dice Auction Variant**:  
  - Use D6 dice for bidding.  
  - Simultaneous hidden bid. Highest number wins.  
  - Tiebreak: Fewer cars owned → roll-off.  
  - Last car: Player without a car wins for $3M.  
- **A.I. Mode (Rubber Band A.I.)**:  
  - A.I. uses face-down speed decks.  
  - Normal: Speed-8 cards face up; used when deck empty.  
  - Hard: Speed-8 shuffled in; reused if move ≤4, unless causes jam.  
  - A.I. movement:  
    - Shortest path (inside lane), avoids jam if possible.  
    - Forces opponents onto longest path, zigzagging.  
  - Power Cards: Player gets fewer as A.I. count increases.  
  - Cheating A.I. counter: Tracks advantage; used in final scoring.  
  - Winning: Player total > A.I. total → win. Ultra Victory if still wins after adding A.I.’s unused cards.
