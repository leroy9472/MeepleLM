## BLITZKRIEG! Solo Rules — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *BLITZKRIEG!*, players simulate strategic military command during World War II, competing to gain control over key theatres of operations and accumulate 25 war victory points. In solo mode, the human player takes the role of the Allied (or Axis, with Nippon Expansion) forces, facing off against an AI bot that follows deterministic rules to simulate an opponent. Victory is achieved by outmaneuvering the AI in campaign control and war victory point accumulation.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Player Role**: You play as the Allied player (or Axis with Nippon Expansion).  
2. **Draw Units**:  
   - Draw 3 unit tokens for yourself (your reserve).  
   - Draw 5 unit tokens for the AI bot and place them face up in a row (its reserve).  
3. **Stratagem Cup**:  
   - Place all 8 stratagem tokens into the cup except "Steamroll" (set it aside).  
4. **Difficulty Setup** (AI pre-advancement):  
   - Roll d6 three or four times (based on difficulty), each roll determining a theatre to advance:  
     - 1 = Western Europe  
     - 2 = Pacific Ocean  
     - 3 = Eastern Europe  
     - 4 = Africa & Middle East  
     - 5 = South East Asia  
     - 6 = Your choice  
   - Advance the respective battle track(s) in the AI’s favor:  
     - **Easy**: 3 rolls, +1 space each  
     - **Medium**: 3 rolls, +2 spaces each  
     - **Hard**: 4 rolls, +2 spaces each  
   - If a theatre is rolled multiple times, advance it multiple times.

5. **Nippon Expansion Setup (Optional)**:  
   - Play as Axis (German) player; AI is Japanese.  
   - Randomly select 2 of the 4 starting campaigns and advance their tracks +2 in AI’s favor.  
   - AI takes the first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players alternate turns. The AI bot takes the first turn in solo mode.

#### On the AI Bot’s Turn:  
1. **Draw Stratagem**:  
   - Draw one stratagem token from the cup.  
   - Discard the previous stratagem back into the cup.  
   - *On first turn*: Place "Steamroll" back into the cup after use.  
2. **AI Placement Procedure**:  
   - Follow the three-step procedure (Theatre → Position → Unit) using current stratagem and game state.  
3. **Draw Unit**:  
   - Draw 1 unit for the AI and place it at the end of its reserve row. Slide units forward to fill any gaps.

#### On Your Turn:  
Follow standard *BLITZKRIEG!* turn phases:  
1. Place a unit from your reserve.  
2. Resolve the battle space effect.  
3. Move the battle marker.  
4. Draw a new unit.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### AI Bot Turn Procedure  
The AI selects actions using a priority-based decision tree.

##### Step 1: Selecting a Theatre  
Choose the first applicable option:  
- A theatre the AI can **close and win** with one placement.  
- A campaign the AI can **close and win** with one placement.  
  - Ignore campaigns where no legal unit can be placed.  
- Apply **stratagem theatre filter** (if any).  
- If multiple theatres remain:  
  1. Most empty spaces in open campaign  
  2. Highest VP value in open campaign  
  3. Top > Bottom (Western Europe > Pacific > Eastern Europe > Africa & Middle East > South East Asia)

##### Step 2: Selecting a Position  
Choose the first applicable option:  
- A position that **closes and wins** the theatre/campaign.  
  - Ignore positions where no legal unit can be placed.  
- Apply **stratagem position filter** (if any).  
- Otherwise, prioritize by:  
  1. Propaganda (if AI has ≥20 VP)  
  2. Strategic advantage  
  3. Propaganda (if player leads by ≥3 VP)  
  4. Industrial production (if AI has ≤4 units)  
  5. Research (Improved Research > Research)  
  6. Bombing  
  7. Tactical advantage  
  8. Industrial production  
  9. Propaganda  
  - If tied: Left > Right

##### Step 3: Selecting a Unit  
Choose the first applicable option:  
- A unit that **closes and wins** a theatre/campaign.  
- Apply **stratagem unit filter** (if any).  
- If position has no effect: Prefer non-zero-value units.  
- If position is last in campaign: Prefer non-blitz units.  
- If AI has ≥20 VP: Choose only highest strength units.  
- If multiple units remain: Roll d6 (1 = leftmost, 2 = next, etc.; loop if needed).

#### Stratagem Effects  
Each stratagem modifies AI preferences:

- **Big Guns**:  
  - Prefers special weapons (if any exist); else, only units that cause "greatest change".  
- **Counterattack**:  
  - Theatre: Only where player is in lead.  
  - Unit: Only units that cause "greatest change".  
- **Economic Warfare**:  
  - Theatre: Prefers those with Industrial Production or Bombing spaces.  
  - Position: If AI has ≤4 units → IP > Bombing; else → Bombing > IP.  
- **For the Glory**:  
  - Theatre: Highest VP campaigns, then those with VP spaces.  
  - Position: Prefers VP (Propaganda) spaces.  
- **Rapid Deployment**:  
  - Unit: Always chooses leftmost valid unit.  
- **Research & Development**:  
  - Theatre: Those with Research spaces.  
  - Position: Research spaces.  
  - Unit: If non-research space selected, prefer special weapons.  
- **Secure**:  
  - Theatre: Only where AI is in lead.  
- **Steamroll**:  
  - Repeats the previous stratagem. On first turn, treated as no effect.

#### "Greatest Change" Priority  
Used to evaluate impact of a move (in decreasing priority):  
1. Turns player lead → AI lead  
2. Turns tie → AI lead  
3. Turns player lead → tie  
4. Increases AI lead (more extreme)  
5. Decreases player lead (more extreme)  
6. Any change that doesn’t cause player to win  
7. Any other change

#### AI Effects Execution  
- **Industrial Production**: Add drawn unit to end of AI’s reserve.  
- **Research**: Draw special weapon → add to cup (not reserve).  
- **Research Industry**: Draw special weapon → place at end of reserve.  
- **Strategic Advantage**: Advance any *other* theatre’s battle track; cannot reach final space.  
- **Tactical Advantage**: Advance current theatre’s battle track.  
- **Propaganda**: Advance AI’s war victory marker.  
- **Blitz Unit Placed**: If AI has ≥1 unit left, repeat Step 2 (same stratagem, same theatre).  
- **Bombing Effect (by player)**: Discard one non-special weapon from AI’s reserve (player’s choice). If all are special weapons, discard one of those.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game Ends When**:  
  - A player reaches **25+ war victory points** at end of their turn.  
    - If **AI** reaches 25 first: Player gets one final turn; highest score wins.  
    - If **player** reaches 25 first: Player wins immediately.  
    - Tie at 25+: Player wins.  
  - A player cannot place a unit (no legal units in reserve): Opponent wins.

- **Scoring**:  
  - **Closing a Campaign**: Winner gains VP equal to campaign value.  
  - **Victory Point Icons**: Gain 1 VP per icon passed on battle track.  
  - **Propaganda Spaces**: Directly advance war victory track.  
  - **Closing a Theatre**: Gain VP for all closed campaigns in it + track icons.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can AI close a theatre via Strategic Advantage?**  
  No. Strategic Advantage cannot move a marker to the final space. Only Tactical Advantage or unit placement can close a theatre.

- **What happens if "Steamroll" is drawn on first turn?**  
  No effect — no prior stratagem to repeat. Proceed normally.

- **Can AI place on a closed campaign?**  
  No. Only active (topmost open) campaigns are eligible.

- **How are ties broken in unit selection with d6?**  
  Units are ordered left to right. d6 roll: 1=leftmost, 2=next, ..., 6=loops back as needed.

- **Does "Research" add to reserve or bag?**  
  AI’s Research adds to cup (not reserve). Research Industry adds directly to reserve.

- **Can AI use Spy or Scientist?**  
  Yes. Scientist is treated as 3-strength Airforce. Spy copies opponent’s last unit.

- **What if AI has no valid move?**  
  If AI cannot place any unit, player wins immediately.
