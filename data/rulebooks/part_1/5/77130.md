### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn has five phases, completed in order by all players:

**2. Trade**
- Collect trade from all city outskirts and Scouts.
- Negotiate trades: Trade points, Culture tokens, Resource tokens, Culture Event cards, non-binding promises.

**3. City Management**
Each city takes one action:
- **Produce**: Build a Figure, Unit, Building, or Wonder (cost ≤ city’s production).
- **Devote to the Arts**: Gain 1 Culture +1 per Culture icon in city outskirts (2 base if Metropolis).
- **Harvest a Resource**: Take 1 resource from an adjacent square.
- **Start a Building Program** (expansion): Place marker; next production action doubles city’s production.

Spending Culture: At any time, spend Culture (and Trade, if required) to advance on Culture track.

**4. Movement**
- Move figures (Army, Scout) up to travel speed (starts at 2; increases with tech).
- No diagonal movement.
- Discover unexplored tiles by spending 1 movement adjacent to them.
- Explore Huts (peaceful) or Villages (battle with barbarians).
- Enter enemy squares: Scouts die; Armies trigger battle.
- Disband figures to Fortify city (Army) or create Caravan (Scout).

**5. Research**
- Simultaneously, each player may research one Tech.
- Must meet Trade cost and have space in Tech Pyramid.
- Trade dial reduces to 0 +1 per Coin on Economy dial.

**Combat**
1. **Assemble Battle Force**
   - Draw battle hand: 3 +2 per extra Army in square +1 if Fundamentalism +3 if defending city.
2. **Calculate Combat Bonuses**

   - +6 for defending non-capital city
   - +12 for defending capital
   - +4 for walled city

   - Units have Strength (damage dealt) and Health (damage to kill).
   - Trumping (Mounted > Artillery > Infantry > Mounted): Trumping unit deals damage first.
   - Aircraft cannot be trumped.
4. **Resolve Battle**
   - After all units played, calculate final combat value:
     - Sum Health of surviving units
     - Subtract total Wounds
     - Add Combat Bonus card value
   - Highest total wins; ties to defender.
   - Winner loses 1 Army per 2 units killed (last Army immune).
