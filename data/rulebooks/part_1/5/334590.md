# FOR NORTHWOOD!

## 1. Lore & Objective
For Northwood! is a solo hand management and precision trick-taking game. You play as a diplomat striving to peacefully unite the woodland kingdom of Northwood by visiting eight fiefs and winning over their rulers through strategic dialogue (trick-taking). The objective is to visit each fief exactly once, ending each visit with a score exactly matching the fief’s target value (0–7), thereby turning its ruler friendly. At the end of the game, victory points from friendly fiefs are totaled. You win by scoring 16 or more victory points.

## 2. Components
- **32 Dialogue Cards**: Numbered 1–8 in four suits: Claws (♠), Flowers (♥), Leaves (♦), Eyes (♣).
- **24 Character Cards**: Six per suit (Jack, Queen, King, Prince, Lady, Baron). Twelve have a crown icon (advanced use).
- **1 Visiting Card**: Tracks your current location; has an arrow and a score chart on the back.
- **8 Fief Cards**: Numbered 0–7, each with a victory point value (1–4 stars).
- **1 Deck**: Composed of the 32 dialogue cards.
- **Piles**: Discard pile and score pile (used during play).
- **Optional**: Advanced Challenge Booklet (for scenario play).

## 3. Setup (Introductory Game)
1. **Arrange Fiefs**: Place the 8 fief cards in a row from 0 (left) to 7 (right).
2. **Set Aside Crowned Cards**: Remove the 12 character cards with the crown icon (not used in introductory play).
3. **Allies**: Place the four Jacks (one of each suit) under the fiefs as your starting allies. Order does not matter.
4. **Rulers**: Shuffle the 8 Kings and Queens. Deal one face-up on each fief card, slightly offset upward. Their suit is the trump for that fief.
5. **Visiting Card**: Place it above the fiefs, arrow side up, pointing down.
6. **Deck**: Shuffle the 32 dialogue cards. Place face-down under the allies.
7. **Piles**: Leave space for discard and score piles.
8. **Starting Hand**: Draw 8 cards from the deck.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game consists of 8 visits, one per fief. During each visit:

### A. Choose a Fief to Visit
- Select any unvisited fief.
- Move the visiting card above that fief.

### B. Bring in Friendly Rulers (Optional)
- Any number of previously won (friendly) rulers may substitute for your allies.
- Each substitute replaces one ally and grants access to their ability for this visit only.

### C. Play Dialogues (Tricks)
Repeat the following until the deck or your hand is empty:

1. **Activate Ally Ability (Optional)**: Exhaust one ally (rotate 90° right) to use their ability. Only one per trick.
2. **Ruler’s Statement**: Reveal the top card of the deck and place it face-up in the discard pile.
3. **Your Response**: Play one card from your hand:
   - Must follow suit if able.
   - If unable to follow suit, any card may be played.
4. **Scoring**:
   - You score a point if:
     - Your card is higher and of the same suit as the ruler’s statement, **or**
     - The ruler’s statement is not in the trump suit (ruler’s suit), but your response is.
   - If you score, place your card in the **score pile** (face up). Otherwise, place it in the **discard pile**.

### D. Ending the Visit
- The visit ends immediately when either your hand or the deck is empty.
- Count cards in the score pile:
  - If count **exactly matches** the fief’s target number (0–7), the ruler becomes **friendly** (slide card down).
  - If not, the ruler is **removed** and the fief is flipped face down.
- Remove all substitutes.
- Reset all exhausted allies (rotate back).
- Shuffle all dialogue cards (score and discard) into a new deck.
- Draw 8 cards for the next visit.
- Repeat until all fiefs are visited.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Trick-Taking Rules
- **Following Suit**: Must play same suit as ruler’s card if possible.
- **Trump Suit**: Equal to the ruler’s suit. Playing a trump card when the lead is not trump scores a point.
- **Scoring**: Only one card per trick (yours) can score. Determined immediately.

### Ally Abilities (One Use Per Visit)

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Memory Rule**: You may freely inspect discard and score piles.
- **Invalid Abilities**: If an ability cannot be performed (e.g., no cards to discard), it does nothing.
- **Partial Execution**: If a draw/move instruction exceeds available cards (e.g., “draw 3” with only 2 left), do as much as possible.
- **Order of Operations**: When moving multiple cards, choose the order.
- **Ties in Value**: When multiple cards have same value (e.g., Lady of Claws), you choose which to discard.
- **Exhaustion**: Only one ally may be activated per trick. Exhaustion resets after each visit.
- **Scoring Edge Cases**:
  - Playing a trump card when the lead is trump does **not** score unless your card is higher.
  - Playing a non-trump on a non-trump lead never scores, regardless of value.
