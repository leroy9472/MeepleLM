### 1. Lore & Objective

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A round proceeds as follows:  
1. **Role Selection Phase**:  
   - The **Governor** selects a role, takes its card, and performs the **action + privilege**.  
   - Other players (in clockwise order) perform the **action only**.  
   - The next player (clockwise) selects a new role.  
   - This continues until all players have selected one role.  
   - In **2-player games**, the Governor selects a second role after the opponent (3 roles per round).  

2. **End of Round**:  
   - Return all used role cards to the center.  
   - Pass the **Governor card** to the left.  
   - **Chapel owners** may place 1 card from hand face-down under their chapel.  
   - Check hand limits:  
     - Max **7 cards** (or **12** if owning a **Tower**)  
     - Excess cards are discarded.
