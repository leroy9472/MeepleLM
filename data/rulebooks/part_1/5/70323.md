## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Players take on the role of giant monsters rampaging through Tokyo, earning Victory Points (★) through destruction, survival, and strategic use of powers.  
The game ends and a player wins immediately when one of the following occurs:  
- A monster reaches **20 Victory Points**.  
- A monster is the **last one remaining** (all others eliminated).  
Note: If a monster reaches 20★ but is eliminated (0 Life) on the same turn, they do **not** win.

2. **Components**  
- 1 Tokyo board (featuring Tokyo City and Tokyo Bay)  
- 66 Power Cards  
- 28 counters:  
  - 3 Smoke Cloud  
  - 1 Mimic  
  - 12 Shrink Ray  
  - 12 Poison Spit  
- 8 dice:  
  - 6 black dice (used by all players)  
  - 2 green dice (used only with specific cards)  
- 6 Monster Boards  
- 6 cardboard monster figures + 6 plastic stands  
- Energy cubes (approx. 50, used for purchasing cards)

3. **Setup**  
- Each player chooses a monster, takes the matching figure, Monster Board, and sets:  
  - Life Points = 10  
  - Victory Points = 0  
- Place the Tokyo board in the center.  
  - With **2–4 players**: Only Tokyo City is active.  
  - With **5–6 players**: Both Tokyo City and Tokyo Bay are active.  
  - "Tokyo" refers to both locations when used in rules or cards.  
- Shuffle the 66 Power Cards into a deck.  
- Reveal the top 3 cards face-up next to the deck (the "store").  
- Place the 6 black dice in the center. Set the 2 green dice aside.  
- Form a shared pool of Energy cubes.  
- Determine the first player:  
  - All players roll the 6 black dice.  
  - The player with the most **Attack** (claw) symbols goes first.  
  - In case of a tie, tied players reroll until a first player is determined.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn consists of the following phases in order:

**1. Start of Turn (if in Tokyo)**  
- If you begin your turn in Tokyo (City or Bay), gain **2 Victory Points**.

**2. Rolling and Rerolling the Dice**  
- Roll all 6 black dice.  
- You may reroll any number of dice **up to two times** (3 rolls total).  
- You may choose to keep or reroll any dice on each reroll, including dice kept previously.  
- Some cards may grant additional rerolls.

**3. Resolving the Dice**  
Resolve all final dice results in any order. Dice symbols:

- **1 / 2 / 3 (Victory Points)**  
  - Rolling **three of the same number** (e.g., 1-1-1) earns Victory Points equal to that number (e.g., 1★ for three 1s).  
  - Each **additional die** of that number earns **+1★** (e.g., four 2s = 2★ + 1★ = 3★; five 3s = 3★ + 2★ = 5★).  
  - Rolling fewer than three of a number earns **0★** for that number.

- **Energy (Lightning Bolt)**  
  - Gain 1 Energy cube per symbol.  
  - Energy cubes can be saved between turns and spent to buy cards.

- **Heal (Heart)**  
  - Gain 1 Life Point (♥) per symbol **only if outside Tokyo**.  
  - Cannot exceed 10 Life.  
  - **No healing from dice while in Tokyo** (but cards may allow it).

- **Attack (Claw)**  
  - Each claw deals **1 damage** to target monsters.  
  - Targeting depends on location:  
    - **In Tokyo**: All monsters **not in Tokyo** take 1 damage each.  
    - **Outside Tokyo**: All monsters **in Tokyo** take 1 damage each.  
  - A monster is "attacking" only if at least one claw is rolled.  
  - If a monster is reduced to 0♥, they are **eliminated**.

**4. Entering or Yielding Tokyo**  
- If **Tokyo is unoccupied**, the first monster on their turn to roll **at least one claw** must:  
  - Move into Tokyo (City first, then Bay if City occupied).  
  - Gain **1★** for entering.  
  - No damage is dealt this turn.  
- If **attacked while in Tokyo**, you may **yield** (flee) to the attacker:  
  - You still take the damage.  
  - The attacker moves into Tokyo and gains 1★.  
- If eliminated **by an attack** while in Tokyo, the attacker takes control.  
- If eliminated **by a card effect** (not an attack), Tokyo becomes unoccupied.  
- **Tokyo Bay rules (5–6 players only)**:  
  - Both Tokyo City and Tokyo Bay are "in Tokyo".  
  - If both are occupied, an attacker damages both. Either or both may yield.  
  - If both yield, the attacker takes Tokyo City.  
  - If player count drops below 5, Tokyo Bay closes: its occupant must leave.

**5. Buying Cards**  
After resolving dice, you may:  
- **Purchase** any face-up card by paying its Energy cost.  
  - "Keep" cards remain in front of you and provide ongoing effects.  
  - "Discard" cards are resolved immediately and discarded.  
- **Sweep the store**: Pay 2 Energy to discard all 3 face-up cards and reveal 3 new ones.  
- You may buy cards and sweep the store in any order, as long as you have Energy.  
- Purchased or swept cards are replaced immediately from the deck.  
- Cards cannot increase Life above 10 unless explicitly stated.

**6. End of Turn**  
- Resolve any card effects that trigger at the end of the turn.  
- Pass the dice to the player on the left.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Energy**: Collected via dice, used to buy cards or sweep store.  
- **Life & Elimination**: Max 10♥. At 0♥, monster is eliminated.  
- **Tokyo Control**: Grants VP bonuses and changes attack targeting.  
- **Card Types**:  
  - **Keep**: Permanent ability until eliminated.  
  - **Discard**: One-time effect.  
- **Counters**: Poison and Shrink counters remain in play even if the card that placed them is discarded.  
- **Dice Reroll Clarification**: Cards that say "reroll" grant an extra reroll during your turn, unless specified otherwise.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- Victory is achieved if:  
  - You reach **20★** and survive the turn (i.e., not eliminated).  
  - You are the **last monster standing**.  
- Game ends immediately when either condition is met.  
- If all monsters are eliminated simultaneously, **no one wins**.  
- Tokyo bonuses:  
  - +1★ for entering Tokyo.  
  - +2★ at the start of each turn if in Tokyo.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can I heal in Tokyo?**  
  No, not from dice. Only via cards.  
- **Is card damage considered an attack?**  
  No. Cards like Gas Refinery deal damage but are not "attacks"—you cannot yield Tokyo from them.  
- **What if I roll 3 hearts in Tokyo?**  
  You gain no Life from the dice, but if a card (e.g. from Power Up) allows drawing an Evolution card on 3 hearts, you may still do so.  
- **Can I voluntarily leave Tokyo?**  
  No. Only by yielding after being attacked.  
- **Do I have to enter Tokyo if it's empty?**  
  Yes, if you roll at least one claw and no one else has entered yet.  
- **What happens to Tokyo Bay when players drop below 5?**  
  It closes. The monster in Tokyo Bay must leave Tokyo (cannot stay in City unless it’s unoccupied).  
- **Can I use Energy immediately after gaining it?**  
  Yes. Energy gained from dice can be spent during the same turn’s card phase.  
- **Can I buy a card and then sweep the store?**  
  Yes. Actions can be done in any order as long as you have Energy.
