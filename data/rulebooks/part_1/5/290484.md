# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective

Unsettled is a cooperative survival game set in a sci-fi universe where players take on the roles of explorers stranded on an alien planet after a spaceship crash. The crew must work together to complete Survival Tasks unique to each planet, gather resources, and return to the Scarab — their escape vessel — before time runs out or their endurance is depleted.

The overarching goal is to survive by completing all objectives of the chosen Survival Task and returning all explorers (conscious or unconscious) and LUNA (the ship’s AI robot) to the Scarab tile. Victory is achieved when this condition is met. If all explorers lose their endurance and become unconscious, the game ends in defeat.

## 4. Gameplay Flow

On a player’s turn, they perform the following actions in any order:

1. **Set Focus (Mandatory)**:
   - Place all 3 Focus Cubes:
     - 2 on available action spaces (must qualify for them).
     - 1 on REST (required every turn).
   - Rotate cubes as indicated (↑ to increase, ↓ to decrease).
   - If a cube is at 0 (sandtimer face) and must be decreased, advance the Time Marker by 1 per required decrease.

2. **Move Explorer (Optional)**:
   - Move 1 orthogonally to an adjacent node.
   - If on an edge node with unrevealed Environment Cards, may reveal a new node by moving into an empty space.
   - Resolve all node-edge symbols and “When Entering” effects immediately.
   - Cannot split movement; movement ends if a Focus action is taken or a new node is revealed.

3. **Program LUNA to Move and/or Scan (Optional)**:
   - Move LUNA 1 node (base movement).
   - LUNA ignores node-edge effects and “When Entering” effects.
   - May scan current node for Data or Materials (if not already present).
     - Roll corresponding d8; place result on node.
     - Resources must be collected later via Analyze Data or Unearth Materials.

4. **Take Free Actions (Optional, Anytime)**:
   - Use Breakthrough abilities.
   - Consume Discoveries.
   - Exchange inventory with local explorers.
   - Forfeit Opportunities.
   - Use Structure abilities.
   - Move Distress cards.
   - Abandon Scientific Pursuit.

5. **End Turn**:
   - Retrieve all Focus Cubes (preserving orientation).
   - Resolve regrouping effects:
     - Flip built Structures to active side.
     - Return destroyed Structures to board.
     - Complete Opportunities or Survival Task actions.
   - Play passes clockwise.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Focus
- 3 types: Awareness (Blue), Wonder (Green), Energy (Orange).
- Used to activate action spaces by placing cubes.
- Each cube has 3/2/1 pips; orientation shows current level.
- REST must be used every turn; increases Focus by 1 and advances Time by 1.
- If a cube at 0 is used for a ↓ action, advance Time instead.

### Movement
- Base movement: 1 per turn.
- Orthogonal only; no diagonals.
- Reveal new nodes by moving into empty spaces; draw top Environment Card.
- Resolve edge effects (e.g., gain Insight ◆, lose Time ⧖) during movement.
- “When Entering” effects apply to all entering explorers.

### LUNA
- Can move 1 node per turn.
- Can scan for Data or Materials (not both; not if already present).
- Required for many actions (e.g., Analyze, Unearth).
- Primary Function varies by planet; can be activated from anywhere.
- Robotics Breakthroughs often allow remote programming of LUNA.

### Comprehension & Breakthroughs
- Gain Insight to advance Scientific Pursuit Cube.
- When cube advances off top of Insight Track:
   - Gain 1 Comprehension token (white disc) in that discipline.
   - Draw 1 Breakthrough Card of same discipline.
   - Reset cube to bottom of track.
- Comprehension is shared among all explorers on the same node.
- Breakthroughs are free actions usable once per player turn.

### Structures
- Buildable on nodes with cogwheel build sites.
- Types: Research Hut (Robotics), Laboratory (Chemistry), Workshop (Engineering).
- To build: Perform BUILD action; either advance Time by 1 or have matching Comprehension.
- Place Structure face-down with Focus cube on it; flip at end of turn.
- Free actions available once built:
   - Research Hut: Spend 1 Data → gain 1 Insight.
   - Laboratory: Spend 1 Material → increase any Focus by 1.
   - Workshop: Spend 1 Power → move LUNA 1 node.
- To destroy: Perform DESTROY action on Structure’s node; advance Time by 1; return Structure at regroup.

### Opportunities
- Revealed via INVESTIGATE action on uninvestigated node.
- Place Investigated Token and Moment Marker.
- Reveal top Opportunity Card; resolve left-column effects.
- Opportunity provides new action space.
- Complete by using its action; discard card and return Moment Marker at regroup.
- Max 2 active Opportunities; may forfeit as free action (if not engaged or occupied).

### Discoveries & Anomalies
- Gained via Opportunities or other effects.
- Claim Discovery Token; draw Anomaly Card.
- Place Discovery on Anomaly.
- Consume as free action if required Comprehension is present on node:
   - Trigger Anomaly’s discard effect.
   - Discard both Discovery and Anomaly.
- Scientific Properties (gold badge) are always active if possessed.

### Resources
- **Data**: Scanned by LUNA; collected via Analyze Data.
- **Materials**: Scanned by LUNA; collected via Unearth Materials.
- **Power**: Gained via Charge Power (move from lower to upper Dynamo).
- Resources are shared.
- Spending: Return to supply (Data/Materials) or lower Dynamo (Power).

### Time & Group Trust
- **Time**:
   - Advances when:
     - REST is used.
     - Crossing Time symbols on node edges.
     - Using actions with Time cost.
     - Using Focus at 0.
   - When Time Marker passes final space: reset to start; all players lose 1 Endurance.
   - Timeline Triggers resolve when marker lands on them.

- **Group Trust**:
   - Two states: High (white) or Low (black).
   - Decrease → move to Low; all players flip Traits to black side.
     - If already Low, distribute -2 Focus instead.
   - Increase → move to High; flip Traits to white.
     - If already High, distribute +2 Focus instead.

### Distress
- Gained from cards or effects.
- Place on any dashboard action except REST.
- Prevents use of that action.
- Can be removed via SUPPORT action (by another explorer).
- If cannot gain Distress (full or deck empty), all players lose 1 Endurance.

### Endurance
- Lose 1 for each E effect suffered.
- Move Endurance Cube down track.
- At bottom: explorer becomes unconscious (cannot act).
- If all explorers unconscious: game lost.

## 6. Scoring & End Game

### Victory Conditions
- Complete all Survival Task objectives.
- All explorers (conscious or unconscious) and LUNA must be on the Scarab.
- Victory achieved immediately when condition is met.

### Defeat Conditions
- If all explorers lose all Endurance and become unconscious: game lost.

### Hollow Victory
- Survival Task completed and at least one explorer reaches Scarab, but not all.
- Considered a partial win.

### End Game Trigger
- Game ends immediately upon:
   - All crew + LUNA on Scarab (win).
   - All explorers unconscious (lose).

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can I use a Breakthrough on my own turn twice?**  
  No. Each Breakthrough can be used only once per player turn (including your own).

- **Can unconscious explorers contribute to tasks?**  
  Yes. They count as present for Survival Task requirements, can be carried, and exchanged with.

- **Can I move a Distress card during another player’s turn?**  
  Yes. Moving a Distress card is a free action.

- **What happens if I can’t pay a Breakthrough cost?**  
  You cannot use the Breakthrough.

- **Can I Investigate a node with an active Opportunity?**  
  No. Each node can be Investigated only once.

- **Do I need to be on a node to use a Structure ability?**  
  No. Structure abilities can be used from anywhere.

- **Can I REST without advancing time?**  
  No. REST always advances Time by 1.

- **Can I use multiple MOVE actions?**  
  Only via TRAVERSE or other effects. Base movement is 1 per turn.

- **Can I scan a node that has one resource but not the other?**  
  Yes. LUNA can scan for the missing resource type.

- **Can I use a Discovery without the required Comprehension?**  
  No. Required Comprehension must be present on your node.
