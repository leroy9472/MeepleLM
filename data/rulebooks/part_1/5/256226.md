## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the role of glaziers competing to furnish the stained glass windows of the Palace of Sintra. The objective is to score the most victory points (VPs) by the end of 6 rounds. The game ends after the 6th round, followed by final scoring. The player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, the player who broke the least glass (i.e., lost the fewest points on the broken glass track) wins. If the tie persists, players share victory.

2. Components  
- 9 Factory Displays  
- 4 Palace Boards (one per player color)  
- 32 Pattern Strips (8 per player color, double-sided)  
- 4 Glaziers (one per player color)  
- 8 Markers (2 per player color: 1 for scoring, 1 for broken glass)  
- 100 Pane Pieces (20 each in 5 colors)  
- 1 Scoring Board with Round Indicator (spaces I–VI)  
- 1 Starting Player Tile ("1" Tile)  
- 1 Glass Tower (stained glass box)  
- 1 Drawstring Bag  

3. Setup  
1. Arrange Factory Displays in a circle:  
   - 2 players: 5 displays  
   - 3 players: 7 displays  
   - 4 players: 9 displays  
   Return unused displays to the box.  
2. Place the Glass Tower beside the Factory Displays.  
3. Each player:  
   - Chooses a color and takes the matching Palace Board.  
   - All players must agree to use the same side (A or B) of their Palace Board.  
4. Each player:  
   - Takes 8 Pattern Strips of their color, shuffles them, and places one above each spire on their Palace Board.  
   - Ensures the Pattern Strip with grey Joker spaces is joker-face down.  
5. Each player places their Glazier above the leftmost Pattern Strip.  
6. The player who most recently cleaned a window takes the Starting Player Tile ("1" Tile).  
7. Place the Scoring Board nearby. Each player places:  
   - One scoring marker on '0' of the score track.  
   - One broken glass marker on '0' of the broken glass track.  
8. Starting Player:  
   - Takes one Pane Piece of each color, randomizes them, and places them on Round Indicator spaces II–VI.  
   - Places remaining 95 Pane Pieces in the bag.  
   - Draws one additional Pane Piece and places it on space I of the Round Indicator.  
9. Starting Player fills each Factory Display with 4 randomly drawn Pane Pieces from the bag.  
10. Bag is placed nearby for use during the game.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in turns, starting with the Starting Player and continuing clockwise. On a turn, a player must choose one of two actions:  
- **Advance a Pattern**, or  
- **Reset Glazier**  

Play continues until all Pane Pieces are removed from Factory Displays and the center. Then, End of Round procedures are triggered.

**Action 1: Advance a Pattern**  
Step 1: Pick Pane Pieces of One Color  
- Option A: Take all pieces of one color from a single Factory Display. Move any remaining pieces from that display to the center.  
- Option B: Take all pieces of one color from the center.  
  - If first to take from center this round:  
    - Take the Starting Player Tile.  
    - Move your broken glass marker down one space.  

Step 2: Place Pieces on One Pattern Strip  
- All picked pieces must be placed on the same Pattern Strip.  
- The selected strip must be under or to the right of your Glazier (never to the left).  
- If placing on a strip to the right, move your Glazier to that strip first.  
- If the strip lacks enough matching spaces:  
  - Excess pieces are "broken."  
  - Move broken glass marker down one per broken piece.  
  - Place broken pieces in the Glass Tower.  
- Grey Joker spaces accept any color.  
- You must place pieces if possible; you cannot voluntarily break all.  

Step 3: Check if Pattern Strip is Complete  
- If the strip under your Glazier now has 5 pieces:  
  a. **Intermediate Scoring**:  
     - Score 1 point for each piece matching the current round’s color (top of Round Indicator).  
  b. **Remove and Retain**:  
     - Remove all 5 pieces. Choose one to keep, place others in Glass Tower.  
     - Place retained piece in the Palace Window below the strip.  
     - If top window slot is empty:  
       - Place piece there, flip Pattern Strip to reverse side, Glazier remains.  
     - If top slot is occupied:  
       - Place piece in bottom slot, window is complete.  
       - Remove Pattern Strip from play. Glazier remains above empty slot.  
  c. **Score Window**:  
     - Score points below the filled window slot.  
     - Also score points below any windows to the right that already contain one or two pieces.  

**Action 2: Reset Glazier**  
- Move Glazier to above the leftmost Pattern Strip.  
- Cannot move above an empty slot.  
- Cannot choose this action if Glazier is already on the leftmost strip.  
- Turn ends.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Turn Order**: Clockwise, starting with Starting Player.  
- **Starting Player**: Determined by who holds the "1" Tile. At start of round, they return it to center. First to take from center gets it for next round.  
- **Glazier Movement**: Can only move right during placement or reset to leftmost.  
- **Joker Spaces**: Grey spaces on one Pattern Strip per player accept any color.  
- **Broken Glass**:  
  - Marker moves down for each broken piece or for first center pickup.  
  - If marker reaches bottom (–18), player loses 18 points, marker resets to top.  
- **Round Indicator**:  
  - Shows current round color (top piece).  
  - After round ends, top piece is removed and placed in Glass Tower.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
After 6 rounds:  
1. **Pattern Strips**: Score 1 point for every 3 Pane Pieces remaining on Pattern Strips (round down).  
2. **Broken Glass**: Lose points equal to value shown next to your marker on the broken glass track.  
3. **Final Scoring (choose A or B)**:  

**A-Scoring (Ornaments):**  
- 4 ornaments (◆) on board. For each:  
  - 4 surrounding pane pieces = 10 points  
  - 3 = 6 points  
  - 2 = 3 points  
  - 1 or 0 = 0 points  

**B-Scoring (Windows & Colors):**  
- Count completed windows (both slots filled).  
- Count total pane pieces of the most-used color in your windows.  
- Final Score = (Completed Windows) × (Most-Used Color Count)  

**Winning:**  
- Highest total score wins.  
- Tiebreaker: Fewest points lost to broken glass.  
- If still tied: Shared victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip placing pieces to break them?**  
  No. If you can place at least one piece on a reachable strip, you must.  
- **What if my Glazier is on an empty slot?**  
  It stays there. You can only place on strips to the right or reset to leftmost non-empty.  
- **Can I use Joker Strip during setup faceup?**  
  No. Must be joker-side down at start.  
- **What if bag is empty during refill?**  
  Refill bag with all pieces from Glass Tower and continue.  
- **Can I take from center more than once per round?**  
  No. Only once, and only the first taker gets the Starting Player Tile and penalty.  
- **What if no pieces left on Factory Displays but center has pieces?**  
  Play continues until center is also empty. Round ends only when both are clear.
