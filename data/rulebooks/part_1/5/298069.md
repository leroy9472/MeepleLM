3. Setup  
1. Set Up Players:  
   - Each player chooses a color and takes:  
     - 2 Runner Figures of their color  
     - 1 Player Board  
     - 1 Phase Token (placed on green "Roll Phase" side)  
     - 7 Light Gray Dice and 2 Dark Gray Dice (placed in Draw Zone)  

2. Choose Card Set:  
   - Select one of the predefined card sets (e.g., "Race 1 [First Game]") from the rulebook.  
   - Unused cards are returned to the box.  

3. Set Up Racetrack:  
   - Place the racetrack (chosen or suggested by card set) in the center.  
   - Place one runner figure from each player on the start space.  
   - Place the fan track adjacent to the racetrack.  
   - Place the second runner figure from each player on the bleachers of the fan track.  
   - Place the 8 selected ability cards around the racetrack.  

4. Set Up Dice Trays:  
   - Assemble dice boxes and place them next to their matching color ability card.  
   - Fill each tray with corresponding dice (e.g., red dice in red tray).  
   - Place unused gray dice in a pile near the play area.  

5. Set Up Token Trays:  
   - Use 4 empty dice boxes as trays for Credits (⑤) and Handtokens (④).  
   - Split Credits and Handtokens roughly evenly between trays.  

6. Determine Start Player:  
   - Randomly select a start player.  
   - Place the Start Player Die in their Roll Zone.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds. Each round consists of two phases:  
1. Roll Phase (simultaneous)  
2. Run Phase (simultaneous)  

After all players complete the Run Phase, the Start Player Die is passed clockwise, and a new round begins. The game ends when any player reaches the finish space.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Zones**: Each player has:  
  - Draw Zone: Dice available to draw  
  - Roll Zone: Dice being rolled  
  - Active Zone: Hits (non-blank results) used for actions  
  - Discard Zone: Used or discarded dice  

- **Roll Phase Steps**:  
  1. **Draw**: Draw dice from Draw Zone to Roll Zone until you have your draw amount.  
     - Base draw amount: 9  
     - +1 per Handtoken (④) owned  
     - +1 per red line between you and the leader on the racetrack  
     - If Draw Zone is empty, move Discard Zone to Draw Zone and continue.  

  2. **Roll**: Roll all dice in Roll Zone.  
     - **Hit**: Any die showing a symbol (not blank)  
     - **Miss**: Blank side showing  

  3. **Move Hits to Active Zone**: Move all hits to Active Zone. Misses remain in Roll Zone.  

  4. **Push or Pass**:  
     - **Pass**: Flip phase token to red "Run" side.  
     - **Push**: Reroll all misses.  
       - You risk busting if you have 3+ dice in Active Zone or previously risked busting.  
       - If you roll all misses and are at risk, you **bust**.  

- **Busting**:  
  - Move all Active Zone dice to Discard Zone.  
  - Optionally move any Roll Zone dice to Discard Zone.  
  - Advance on fan track by 1 space and gain rewards.  
  - Flip phase token to Run side.  

- **Run Phase Steps**:  
  1. **Use Abilities, Resolve ⑤, Determine Total**:  
     - Use Run abilities.  
     - Resolve red card effects (compare ⑤).  
     - Determine total ⑤ and ④.  

  2. **Move**:  
     - Move 1 space per ⑤.  
     - Spend 4 ⑤ or ④ to gain 1 ⑤.  
     - If you end movement in a reward space (and didn’t start there), gain the reward.  
     - Movement effects (e.g., Jet Pack, Shortcut) can be used mid-movement.  

  3. **Buy**:  
     - Spend ⑤ and ④ to buy up to 2 different dice.  
     - Place bought dice in Discard Zone.  

  4. **Discard**:  
     - Move all Active Zone dice to Discard Zone.  
     - Keep Roll Zone dice for next round.  
     - Flip phase token to Roll side.  

  - After all players finish, pass Start Player Die clockwise.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Game Trigger**: Any player reaches the finish space.  
- **How to Win**:  
  - If only one player reaches the finish space: that player wins.  
  - If multiple players reach it in the same round:  
    - Winner is the one who moves the farthest beyond the start space.  
    - If still tied, play an additional round. Repeat until tie is broken.  

- **Fan Track**:  
  - Advance 1 space when you bust or gain a fan (④).  
  - Gain ⑤ and ④ shown on the space.  
  - Fan count = number of spaces advanced (used by some abilities).  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Busting with Fewer Dice**: Once you risk busting (by pushing with ≥3 Active dice), you continue to risk busting on all subsequent pushes, even if Active dice drop below 3.  
- **Using Abilities**:  
  - Now: Use immediately when die is placed in Active Zone.  
  - Active: Ongoing effect while die is in Active Zone.  
  - Run: Use during Run Phase.  
- **Power Symbols**: If you use a power symbol ability, you must resolve both the regular and power effects.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  - For ⑤ comparisons: Start Player Die breaks ties (clockwise from start player).  
  - For movement ties: Additional round(s) until resolved.  
- **Water Spaces**: Cannot enter unless an ability allows it (e.g., Undercover Fish, Bahama Llama).  
- **Shortcuts**: Pay cost to jump to matching shortcut space. Can be used mid-movement.  
- **Jet Pack**: Double remaining ⑤ when entering the space.  
- **Public Supply**: If a dice tray is empty, dice cannot be bought until returned via "Lose a Die" effects.  
- **Free Dice**: Gaining a die for free (e.g., via reward) does not count toward the 2-dice purchase limit.
