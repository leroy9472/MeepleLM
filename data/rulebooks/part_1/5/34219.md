## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Biblios*, players take on the role of abbots building their monastic library by acquiring valuable books and manuscripts. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VP) by having the highest total card value in each of five color categories. Victory points are determined by dice values associated with each category, which can be modified during the game using Church cards.

### 2. Components  
- Deck of cards in five colors:  
  - Monks (Brown)  
  - Pigments (Blue)  
  - Holy Books (Green)  
  - Manuscripts (Yellow)  
  - Forbidden Tomes (Red)  
- Gold cards (numbered 1, 2, 3)  
- Church cards (with +1, –1, or +2/–2 die-modification abilities)  
- Scriptorium board with five colored zones  
- Five six-sided dice (one per color category), initially set to 3

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the Scriptorium in the center and set each die to 3.  
2. Remove cards based on player count:  
   - 2 players: Remove 2 of each gold card (6 total), then 21 random cards  
   - 3 players: Remove 1 of each gold card (3 total), then 12 random cards  
   - 4 players: Remove 7 random cards  
3. Shuffle the remaining cards into a draw deck.  
4. Choose a non-payment penalty method:  
   - **Standard**: Each other player takes one random card from the bluffer’s hand  
   - **Medieval Bluff (variant)**: Bluffer discards one random card, chosen by the player to their left  
5. Randomly select a starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in two distinct phases:

#### Phase 1: Gift Phase  
While the draw deck is not empty:  
1. Active player draws **(number of players + 1)** cards one at a time.  
2. For each card, places it into one of three zones:  
   - **Personal hand (face down)** – exactly 1 card per turn  
   - **Auction pile (face down)** – exactly 1 card per turn  
   - **Public Pool (face up)** – remaining cards (1 per opponent)  
   - Once placed, cards cannot be moved.  
3. After placement:  
   - The active player adds their chosen card to their hand.  
   - Other players, in clockwise order, each take **one** card from the Public Pool into their hand.  
4. Pass the draw deck to the next player clockwise.  
5. **Church Card Note**: If a player acquires a Church card during this phase (into their hand), they may immediately use it to adjust die values (see Church Cards section), then discard it.

The phase ends when the draw deck is exhausted.

#### Phase 2: Auction Phase  
1. Shuffle the Auction pile to form the **Auction deck**.  
2. Starting with the original first player, each player in turn:  
   a. Reveals the top card of the Auction deck  
   b. Bidding begins with the player to their left  
   c. Players may **bid higher** or **pass**  
   d. Once a player passes, they cannot re-enter bidding for that card  
   e. Bidding continues until only one player remains (winner)  
   f. If all players pass, the card is discarded  
3. Winner pays according to card type:  
   - **Non-Gold Card (color card)**: Bid in gold value. Pay with gold cards from hand. No change given. Excess payment is allowed.  
   - **Gold Card**: Bid in number of cards to discard. Pay by discarding that many cards face down (any type).  
4. If the winner **cannot or will not pay**:  
   - Penalty is applied per chosen method  
   - The card is re-auctioned; the penalized player **cannot participate**  
5. After resolution, the next player clockwise becomes active.  
6. **Church Card Note**: If a Church card is won, the player may immediately use it (adjust die(s)), then discard it. Game pauses for resolution.  
7. Phase ends when Auction deck is exhausted.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Placement (Gift Phase)**: Strategic allocation of drawn cards to personal hand, auction, or public pool. Players must place exactly one card to each destination (personal, auction, public).  
- **Bidding**:  
  - Open bidding with clockwise order  
  - No bluffing allowed unless you can pay  
  - Highest bidder wins; payment must be fulfilled  
- **Church Cards**:  
  - When acquired (into hand), player may:  
    - Use it to modify die values, then discard  
    - Or discard it unused  
  - **Single-die cards**: Adjust one die up or down by 1  
  - **Double-die cards**: Must adjust two different dice (each by ±1); cannot adjust the same die twice  
  - Cannot be saved; resolved immediately upon acquisition  
- **Penalty for Non-Payment**:  
  - Standard: Each other player takes one random card from the bluffer’s hand  
  - Medieval Bluff: Player to bluffer’s left randomly selects one card for bluffer to discard  
  - Card is re-auctioned without the bluffer

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Condition**: Game ends when the Auction deck is fully resolved (all cards auctioned or discarded).

**Scoring Steps**:  
1. For each of the five color categories:  
   - Players reveal all cards in that color  
   - Sum card values  
   - Player with **highest total** wins the die value in VP for that category  
2. **Tie-breaking per category**:  
   - Compare the **letter in the bottom-right corner** of the cards  
   - Player with the card closest to **"A"** wins (alphabetical order)  
   - If still tied, the category has **no winner** (no one scores the die)  
3. **Final Victory Points**: Sum of all dice won  
4. **Overall Tie-breakers**:  
   - Most gold cards remaining in hand  
   - If still tied: Highest total in **Monks (Brown)** category  
   - If still tied: Highest total in **Pigments (Blue)**, then **Holy Books (Green)**, **Manuscripts (Yellow)**, **Forbidden Tomes (Red)** in order

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a Church card in the Public Pool?**  
  Yes, but it is not resolved until a player takes it into their hand.  
- **Can I use a Church card won in auction immediately?**  
  Yes. Game pauses for resolution before continuing.  
- **Can I bid more cards than I have for a gold card auction?**  
  No. You cannot bid more cards than are in your hand.  
- **What if I win a bid but cannot pay exactly?**  
  For gold bids: You may overpay (no change), but must pay at least your bid using available gold cards.  
- **Are Public Pool cards public knowledge?**  
  Yes. Once taken, they are known. House rule suggestion: Keep them face-up in front of the player.  
- **Can I adjust a die beyond 1 or 6?**  
  No. Dice are clamped to range 1–6.  
- **What happens if all players pass in an auction?**  
  Card is discarded. Turn ends. No penalty.
