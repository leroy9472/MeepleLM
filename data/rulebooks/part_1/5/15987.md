# ARKHAM HORROR  
The Definitive Reference Manual  

---

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 1926, the city of Arkham is under siege by otherworldly forces as gates to alien dimensions begin to open. Players take on the roles of Investigators—ordinary people uncovering forbidden truths—who must explore Arkham and its surrounding Other Worlds to close gates, seal them permanently, and prevent the Ancient One from awakening.  

**Victory Conditions (Group Win):**  
- Close all gates and possess a number of gate trophies equal to or greater than the number of investigators.  
- Place 6 or more Elder Sign tokens on Arkham locations.  
- Defeat the Ancient One during the Final Battle.  

**Defeat Conditions (Group Loss):**  
- The Doom Track fills.  
- Too many gates are open (more than 8, or more than half the number of players, rounded down).  
- No gate markers or monsters remain in their respective pools.  
- Terror Level reaches 10 and twice the monster limit is on the board.

- **Arrested**: Go to jail, lose half money, lose next turn  

#### Special Rules  
- **Spells are Items**: Count toward discard totals.
