---

5. **Core Mechanics**  

**A. Explore the Depths**  
- Reveal cards one at a time from the Exploration deck onto the Exploration Track.  
- **Ally Revealed**:  
  - Offer to each opponent clockwise: first purchase costs 1 Pearl, second 2, third 3.  
  - Each opponent may buy only one Ally per turn.  
  - If no one buys it:  
    - You may take it for free (ends turn), or  
    - Leave it and draw another.  
  - If the last space is filled and no one buys, you must take it and gain 1 Pearl.  
- **Monster Revealed**:  
  - **Fight**: Automatic victory. Gain rewards based on Threat Track position. Reset Threat token. Turn ends.  
  - **Keep Exploring**: Move Threat token down one space. Monster stays on track. Continue.  
  - If Monster is revealed on the last space, you must fight it and gain 1 extra Pearl.  
- **End of Exploration**:  
  - All remaining Allies go face down to matching Race stacks in the Council.  
  - Monsters discarded.  
  - Kraken Allies go to a Race stack of your choice.  

**B. Request Support from the Council**  
- Take all cards from one face-down Race stack in the Council.  
- Add to your hand without looking.  
- Hand limit: 12 Ally cards. Excess must be discarded or paid for with Pearls (1 Pearl per extra card).  
- Kraken cards cannot be discarded this way.  

**C. Recruit a Lord**  
- Pay the cost shown on a Lord card:  
  - Exact number of different Races required (bubbles).  
  - Mandatory Race (large bubble) must be included.  
  - Total value of Allies ≥ cost value.  
  - May use Pearls or Nebulis (1 per missing point; Nebulis only after Pearls exhausted).  
  - Kraken Allies count as any Race and grant Nebulis when played.  
- Discard all used Allies except one with the lowest value (affiliated).  
  - Kraken Allies are discarded and grant Nebulis but are not affiliated.  
- Place Lord in front of you ("free").  
- **Lord Powers**:  
  - Arrow (→): One-time effect when recruited.  
  - No arrow: Semi-permanent (lasts until used to control a Location).  
- **Refill Court**:  
  - Slide Lords right.  
  - If ≤2 Lords remain, refill all spaces and gain 2 Pearls.  
  - If insufficient cards to refill, trigger endgame.  

**D. Control Locations**  
- Triggered when you gain your 3rd Key (from Monster fight, Lord, or Loot card).  
- Options:  
  - Take one face-up Location, or  
  - Draw 1–4 Location tiles, choose one, place others face-up.  
- Place chosen Location in front of you.  
- Slide Lords used to control it underneath (powers hidden).  
- Discard Key tokens used.  
- **Sanctuary Locations (Kraken)**:  
  - Draw Loot cards one at a time.  
  - Stop anytime to keep rewards.  
  - If a duplicate value is drawn, discard all duplicates and end search.  
  - Rewards: VPs, Pearls, Monster tokens, Ally draws, or Keys.  

**E. Sentinel Tokens (Kraken)**  
- Acquired via Watcher, Vigil, or Lookout Lords.  
- Use to reserve:  
  - A Lord in Court  
  - A Council stack  
  - A face-up Location  
- Only you may claim the reserved item.  
- Reclaim token after taking the item; may reuse next turn.  

**F. Leviathan Combat (Leviathan)**  
- When "Keep Exploring" on Monster:  
  - Roll 2 dice, place new Leviathan in matching zone on Border.  
  - If zone occupied, suffer penalty, replace Leviathan.  
- To fight a Leviathan:  
  - Discard required Ally (per Leviathan card).  
  - Roll die; attack = Ally value + die roll.  
  - Damage = number of Resistance levels met or exceeded.  
  - Gain rewards per damaged Health level.  
  - On kill: keep Leviathan card.  
  - Most Leviathans killed earns Scourge of the Abyss (+5 IP).  

**G. Nebulis (Kraken)**  
- Black pearls used like currency (1 per transaction, after Pearls).  
- Gained from:  
  - Kraken Ally cards (when played or in hand at game end)  
  - Opponents paying you  
- Scoring: −1 IP per Nebulis.  
- Kraken Mini: −5 IP to player with most Nebulis (changes on ties).  

---

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
**End Game Triggers** (game ends after current player finishes, then others get one final turn):  
- Any player recruits their 7th Lord.  
- Court cannot be fully refilled (≤2 Lords left, not enough to refill).  
- Leviathan deck is empty.  
- Either Monster token deck is empty.  

**Final Steps**:  
1. Each player takes one last turn.  
2. **Affiliate Remaining Allies**:  
   - For each Race, affiliate the lowest-value Ally in hand.  
   - Discard others.  
   - Kraken cards: gain Nebulis, then discard (no affiliation).  
3. **Scoring**: Sum:  
   - **Locations Controlled** (per tile formula)  
   - **Lords Recruited** (VPs on cards)  
   - **Strongest Affiliated Ally per Race** (highest value of each Race)  
   - **Monster Tokens Held** (values 2–4)  
   - **Loot Cards** (VPs from Sanctuary searches)  
   - **−1 IP per Nebulis**  
   - **−5 IP** if holding Kraken Mini  
   - **+5 IP** if holding Scourge of the Abyss  

**Tiebreakers**:  
1. Most Pearls  
2. Highest-value Lord  
3. Most Lords

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Hand Limit**: Max 12 Ally cards. Excess: pay 1 Pearl per extra or discard. Kraken cards exempt.  
- **Kraken Cards**: Wild for recruitment, grant Nebulis, never affiliated.  
- **Ambassadors**: Can control a Location alone (no Keys needed). Slide under Location.  
- **Assassin Power**: Rotates Lord 90°; only IP counts, no Powers or Keys. Can still be replaced by Traitor/Schemer.  
- **Master of Magic**: Power applies to future recruitments (affiliation happens before power triggers).  
- **Tie for Nebulis**: Player currently holding Kraken Mini keeps it until overtaken.  
- **Loot Card Monster**: Draw Ally until success; raise Threat Track per Monster.  
- **Sentinel Conflicts**: Only one Sentinel per board region (Court, Council, Locations).
