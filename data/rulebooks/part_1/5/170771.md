## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows three phases:

#### I. Time Phase  
1. **Effects Cleanup**: Apply damage first, then other effects (e.g., Fire tokens deal 1 HP).  
2. **Powers Refresh**: Flip used powers with refresh icon face-up.  
3. **Powers Cooldown**: Rotate all used powers 90° clockwise.  
4. **Soul Enhancements / Resurrection**:  
   - Spend Soul Points to increase Soulrank: cost = (target Soulrank)².  
   - Cannot enhance if another hero has lower Soulrank.  
   - Resurrect: Spend current Soulrank in Soul Points while in active shrine.  
5. **Flip Gem Bookmarks** (track active hero).

#### II. Battle Phase (repeat for each hero)  
**Hero Turn**  
- **1 Movement Activity**: Can be split with Actions/Free Actions, but not Combat.  
  - Evade: If not dominating area with enemies, receive one reaction attack per enemy when leaving.  
- **X Combat Activities**: Used to make attacks (weapon, item, or power with Red Fist icon).  
- **X Action Activities** (choose any number, once per round unless noted):  
  - Dash: Gain +1 movement OR stand up after being K.O.’d.  
  - Focus an Attack: +1 hit on next attack (must be declared before rolling).  
  - Provoke Master Enemy: Modify Menace token of Master Enemy in Line of Sight.  
  - Bash Chest/Locked Door (if not engaged): Draw and resolve Trap card, then open.  
  - Reorganize Equipped Items (if not engaged): Swap equipped items.  
  - Exchange Item/Crowns (if not engaged): Pass one item or crowns; receiver may equip if slot free.  
  - Search (if not engaged): Flip Search token, roll Red die, apply result, remove token.  
- **Unlimited Free Actions**:  
  - Open Normal Door: Draw and resolve Trap card, then open.  
  - Open Magic Lock: Free Action if carrying Magic Key.  
  - Pick Up/Drop Items or Crowns (if not engaged).  
  - Evade: Move out of enemy area (subject to reaction attacks).  

**Enemy Turn**  
- If enemies present: Draw Encounter card and resolve it.  
- Active hero flips gem bookmark.  

#### III. Event Phase  
- If top Event card unrevealed: Draw and resolve it. Place revealed on top of deck.  
  - Night/Day cards are placed beside deck after resolution.  
- If top card revealed: Discard it.  
- When Event deck runs out, reinforcements arrive (victory condition in *Spittlesnot*).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Combat System  
**Engagement**: Entering enemy area triggers engagement; attacks only allowed within same area.  

**HIT Stage**:  
1. Roll dice: 1 Blue die if unarmed or using non-weapon item/power.  
2. Apply modifiers:  
   - +1 if attacker’s faction dominates area (Supremacy).  
   - +1 if attack was Focused.  
   - Use pre-roll effects (e.g., Critical chance, AoE).  
3. Sum hits.  
   - **Critical**: Triggered if at least one hit is rolled (even if blocked); draw Critical token.  
   - **Bash**: Defender is pushed back 1 area if at least one hit lands.  
   - **Lethal**: Resolved before normal hits; ignores armor and defense dice.  
   - **AoE {X}**: Affects primary target and all same-faction units in target area and adjacent areas within X range.  

**DEF Stage**:  
1. Apply resistances/weaknesses.  
2. Armor reduces hits unless target is K.O.’d or hit is Lethal.  
3. Spend Magic Shields to block hits (including Lethal), after armor.  
4. Roll 1 Blue die per remaining hit (max as specified on card; 1 if no armor).  
5. Use defensive effects (e.g., rerolls).  
6. Suffer damage = Hits – Shields (min 0).  
7. Apply death effects or damage reactions.  

#### Line of Sight (LoS)  
Trace line from source area’s Sight Mark to target’s without crossing:  
- Blocking terrain  
- External map edge  
- Non-target areas with enemy figures (only if source is hero)  
- Limited to 5 spaces  

#### Area Control  
- **Controlling**: More figures of one faction than opposing in an area.  
- **Dominating**: At least twice as many; grants +1 hit to attackers.  

#### Special Effects  
- **Fire**:  
  - Fire I/II token placed on character or map.  
  - During Time Phase: Fire I deals 1 HP and is removed; Fire II deals 1 HP and flips to Fire I.  
  - All characters in area with Fire token suffer same effect.  
- **Critical/Bash/AoE**: Only one instance per attack applies; duplicates are wasted.  
- **Lethal**: Always skips armor and defense dice.  
- **Hidden**: Hidden heroes cannot be targeted directly (except by AoE or global effects).  

#### Conditions  
- A character can have multiple different conditions but not the same twice.  
- If duplicated, discard second and suffer 1 wound.  
- Examples: Poisoned, Stunned, Slowed.  

#### Soul Points & Soulrank  
- Spend during Time Phase to increase Soulrank: cost = (new Soulrank)².  
- Cannot enhance if another hero has lower Soulrank.  
- Soulrank determines number of Powers and Talents (via Soul Gem).  
- Soulrank Formula:  
  - I=1, II=2, III=3, IV=4, V=5, VI=6, VII=7  
  - Soulrank/2: I/II=1, III/IV=2, V/VI=3, VII=4  

#### Companions  
- Activated by owner during owner’s turn.  
- Count as hero for spawn formulas and area control if Hero Count ≥1.  
- Cannot perform Actions or Free Actions, equip items, or be healed by heroes.  
- Can receive buffs (e.g., Bless).  

#### Resurrection (Ghost Soul)  
- Upon death:  
  - Drop items, lose Soulrank (min I), flip to Ghost Soul side.  
  - Draw enemy power if killed by Green/Blue enemy (unless already at max).  
- Ghost Soul abilities (once per turn):  
  - Soul Shout  
  - Recall (to active shrine)  
  - Move (fly, ignore hindrances)  
- Resurrect: Spend Soul Points equal to current Soulrank in active shrine during Time Phase.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Victory Conditions (*Spittlesnot*)**:  
- Locate Peach (§9) **before** Day card is discarded (§6).  
- Survive until Event deck is exhausted (reinforcements arrive).  

**Failure Conditions**:  
- Day card discarded before Peach is found.  
- All heroes defeated.  

**Rewards (if victorious)**:  
- 50 Crowns per hero  
- 2 Soul Points per hero  
- 2 Treasure cards per hero  
- Optional: Rescue Gremlina (§14: +2 SP), Untie her (§15: +1 SP), or Abandon (§16: risk save vs coin loss)  

**Loot Collection**:  
- At quest end, surviving heroes automatically collect all Loot, Crowns, and Items within base movement range, up to inventory limit.  
- Excess must be left behind.  
- Discarded Treasure cards return to deck after quest.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Rerolls**: No die can be rerolled more than once. Cannot use pre-reroll result.  
- **Same Effect Stacking**: Identical effects from same-named items/powers do not stack unless used at different power levels.  
- **Hidden Heroes**: Cannot be targeted directly (including by "closest hero" behavior). Only affected by AoE or global effects.  
- **Stunned Enemies**: Complete current movement, skip rest of turn. Condition removed after next skipped activation.  
- **Critical/Bash/AoE**: Only one instance per attack triggers; extras are wasted.  
- **Magic Shields**: Can block Lethal hits, but only **after** armor is applied.  
- **Doors/Chests**: Opening always requires Trap card draw unless specified otherwise (e.g., §3 gate).  
- **Combat vs Attack**: "Combat Activity" is a resource; "Attack" is the full HIT/DEF sequence. Some powers allow extra attacks without spending Combat Activity.  
- **Soul Point Storage**: Max 10 carried into ACT II quests; excess discarded.  
- **Bags/Backpacks**: Each occupies 1 slot; max 1 Bag and 1 Backpack per hero (same-effect restriction).
