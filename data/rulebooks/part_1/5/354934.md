Townsfolk Card Uses:  
- Play to Exhausted Pile: gain items on brown background (top-left).  
- Discard to Discard Pile: gain all items (brown and red backgrounds).  
- Tuck beneath Board: improves future Harvests. One per available space (1 base + 1 per Hut built).  
- Food Icons (tan background): used only when Story Book events allow.

1. Barge must be on left-most Canal Card.  
2. Spend Workers and Cowrie Shells shown on the Canal Card.  
3. Move Barge off the Board.

1. Spend Provisions shown below the Barbarian Card.  
2. Spend Workers shown on the left of the Barbarian Card.
