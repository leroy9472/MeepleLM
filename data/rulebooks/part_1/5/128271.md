## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the role of urban planners in the futuristic city of Ginkgopolis, constructing and expanding districts made of towering buildings grown from Ginkgo Biloba trees. The goal is to earn the most Success Points (SPs) by strategically building, exploiting resources, and gaining control over districts. The game ends when either the building tile supply is exhausted for the second time or any player places their final resource in the city. The player with the most SPs after final scoring wins.

2. Components  
- Building Tiles: Numbered 1–25 across three colors (Red, Yellow, Blue)  
  - Tiles 1–3 of each color: used to form the initial 3×3 city grid  
  - Tiles 4–20: shuffled to form the main building supply  
  - Tiles 21–23 ("New Buildings"): shuffled together, used as optional expansion  
  - Tiles 24–25 ("Prestige Buildings"): placed face-up per color, 24 atop 25  
- Urbanization Tokens (A–L): placed around the initial city grid  
- Cards:  
  - 12 Urbanization Cards (A–L)  
  - Building Cards (1–25 per color), matching tiles  
  - Character (Employee) Cards with special abilities  
  - Expert Cards (expansion)  
  - Event Tiles (expansion)  
- Resources: Ownership Markers (colored tokens, referred to as "resources")  
- Success Point (SP) Tokens (1, 3, 5, 10)  
- Construction Site Pawns ("Cranes")  
- Player Screens and New Hand Tokens (2 per player)  
- First Player Token

3. Setup  
- Form the Starting City: Randomly place the 9 Building Tiles (1–3 in each color) in a 3×3 grid.  
- Place Urbanization Tokens: Arrange tokens A–L in alphabetical order around the perimeter of the grid.  
- Prepare Building Tile Supply:  
  - Shuffle tiles 4–20 (R/Y/B) into face-down stacks.  
  - For 2–3 players: remove 6 random tiles from the game.  
  - If using New Buildings (21–23): remove 3 tiles from 4–20.  
  - If using Prestige Buildings (24–25): remove 3 tiles from 4–20.  
  - If using Green Spaces: remove 3 tiles from 4–20.  
  - Shuffle New Buildings (21–23) and place face-down.  
  - Place Prestige Buildings (24–25) face-up per color, 24 atop 25.  
- Form the Draw Deck:  
  - Combine 12 Urbanization Cards (A–L) and 9 Building Cards (1–3 per color).  
  - Shuffle and place face-down.  
  - For 2–3 players: discard the top 7 cards face-up next to the deck.  
- Sort Remaining Building Cards: Stack by color, numbered 4–20 ascending, placed near the board.  
- Player Setup:  
  - Each player chooses a color, takes a player screen, and 2 New Hand Tokens.  
  - Starting Resources:  
    - 2 players: 25 resources  
    - 3 players: 20 resources  
    - 4 players: 18 resources  
    - 5 players: 16 resources  
  - Deal 4 Character Cards to each player. Draft 3 by selecting one and passing the rest left until each has 3. Return unused cards to the box.  
  - Players take starting resources, tiles, and SPs as shown on their 3 Character Cards (top-left corner), placing them behind their screen.  
  - Place Character Cards face-up in front of the screen, grouped by action type.  
  - The starting First Player takes the First Player Token.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:

**Phase 1: Choose a Card**  
- Simultaneously and secretly, each player selects one card from their hand of 4.  
- Optionally, before selecting, a player may discard a New Hand Token to discard their entire hand and draw 4 new cards (twice per game).  
- The chosen card may be played alone or with a Building Tile (placed face-down on the card).  
- The 3 unselected cards (and First Player Token, if held) are placed face-down in front of the player’s screen.

**Phase 2: Resolve Actions**  
- Starting with the First Player and proceeding clockwise, each player reveals their card (and tile, if played).  
- The action resolved depends on the card type and whether a tile was played:

| Card Type | Played With Tile? | Action |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Urbanization Card | No | **Exploit Undeveloped Land**: Take 1 Building Tile or 1 Resource from the general supply. |
| Building Card | No | **Exploit Building**: Gain resources based on building color and height:  
Red = Resources (1 per level)  
Blue = Tiles (1 per level)  
Yellow = SPs (1 per level) |
| Urbanization Card | Yes | **Urbanize (Develop Land)**:  
1. Place tile where matching Urbanization Token (A–L) is located.  
2. Place 1 Resource (from behind screen) and 1 Construction Site Pawn on the tile.  
3. Move the Urbanization Token to an adjacent empty edge (orthogonal only), maintaining alphabetical order.  
4. Exploit all orthogonally adjacent buildings (gain resources as if exploiting them). |
| Building Card | Yes | **Construct (Develop Building)**:  
1. Place tile on building matching the card.  
2. Return any displaced Resources to their owner (owner places behind screen). If owner is opponent, they gain 1 SP per resource.  
3. Place Resources from behind screen equal to the new building’s level (1 per floor).  
4. Place a Construction Site Pawn on the tile.  
5. Penalties:  
   - If new tile number < covered tile number: pay difference in SPs to supply.  
   - If new tile color ≠ covered tile color: pay 1 Resource to supply.  
6. Keep the played Building Card in your tableau (face-up). It grants ongoing bonuses. |

- If a player cannot complete the required action (e.g., lacks resources), they take the tile back and instead perform the Exploit action for that card type.  
- After resolving the action, the player gains any applicable bonuses from cards in their tableau (e.g., "Exploiting Bonus", "Urbanizing Bonus", "Constructing Bonus").

**Phase 3: Prepare for Next Round**  
- Pass the 3 unused cards (and First Player Token, if present) to the left.  
- Starting with the new First Player, each player draws 1 card from the deck to restore their hand to 4 cards.  
- If the deck is exhausted:  
  1. Identify all tiles with Construction Site Pawns.  
  2. Retrieve the corresponding Building Cards and add them to the discard pile.  
  3. Shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.  
  4. For 2–3 players: discard the top 7 cards face-up.  
  5. Return all Construction Site Pawns to the supply.  
- The First Player Token is passed to the left.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Adjacency**: Always orthogonal (not diagonal).  
- **Districts**: Formed by 2+ orthogonally adjacent buildings of the same color. Single tiles do not form districts.  
- **Tile Supply Replenishment**:  
  - When the Building Tile supply (4–20) is exhausted for the first time:  
    1. Each player simultaneously chooses how many tiles (0 or more) to return from behind their screen.  
    2. All returned tiles are revealed; players gain 1 SP per tile returned.  
    3. Tiles are shuffled to form a new face-down supply.  
- **New Hand Tokens**: Can be used twice per game to discard and redraw entire hand. Each unused token is worth 2 SP at game end.  
- **Green Spaces (Optional)**:  
  - May be taken once per turn by spending 1 tile draw.  
  - Score 1 SP per floor of each adjacent building.  
  - Adjacent resources count toward district control.  
- **Prestige Buildings (Optional)**:  
  - Can be taken by spending 3 tile draws per tile (face-up 24–25).  
  - Placed face-up in supply: 24 atop 25 per color.

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Conditions** (trigger end after current round):  
- The Building Tile supply is exhausted for the second time.  
- Any player places their last resource in the city.  

**Final Scoring**:  
Players earn SPs from:  
1. All SP tokens behind their screen.  
2. All cards in their tableau with the “=” icon (endgame bonus).  
3. 2 SP for each unused New Hand Token.  
4. **District Control**:  
   - A district is 2+ orthogonally adjacent buildings of the same color.  
   - **1st Place**: Most resources in the district → earns SP equal to total resources (all players) in the district.  
   - **2nd Place**: Second-most resources → earns SP equal to their own resources in the district.  
   - **Tiebreakers**:  
     1. Player with tallest building in the district.  
     2. If still tied, player with highest-numbered tallest building wins.  
   - **Sole Control**: If one player owns all resources in a district, they score both 1st and 2nd place (2 SP per resource).  

**Winning**: Player with the most SPs wins. No tiebreaker specified.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a tile on a building of a different color?** Yes, but you must pay 1 Resource to the supply.  
- **Can I play a lower-numbered tile on a higher-numbered building?** Yes, but you must pay the difference in SPs to the supply.  
- **What if I play a Construct action but can’t pay the cost?** Take the tile back and perform the Exploit action with the card instead.  
- **Do I get SPs for returning my own resources when building on my building?** No. Only opponents gain SPs when their resources are displaced.  
- **When do Construction Site Pawns get removed?** When the deck is reshuffled — their corresponding cards are added to the discard pile, and pawns are returned to supply.  
- **Can I use both New Hand Tokens?** Yes, up to two times per game.  
- **Do single buildings score?** No. Only districts of 2+ same-color adjacent buildings score.
