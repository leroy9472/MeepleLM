## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Castle Combo, players act as rulers recruiting characters from the Castle and Village to build their 9-character tableau. The Messenger pawn indicates the current recruitment location. Each character provides an immediate ability and end-game points based on scoring conditions. The goal is to achieve the highest score after all players have 9 cards in their 3×3 tableau.

2. Components  
- 39 Castle cards (gray back)  
- 39 Village cards (brown back)  
- 1 Messenger pawn  
- 52 Gold tokens (40 × 1, 12 × 5)  
- 44 Key tokens (36 × 1, 8 × 3)  
- 1 double-sided game aid (icon reference)  
- 1 score pad  
- Rulebook  

Gold and Keys are unlimited; use substitutes if needed.

3. Setup  
- Shuffle Castle cards into a deck; place centrally. Reveal top 3 cards in a row beside the deck.  
- Repeat for Village cards; place below Castle row.  
- Place Messenger pawn beside the Village row.  
- Each player receives 15 Gold and 2 Keys.  
- Remaining Gold and Keys form the supply.  
- Randomly select the starting player.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise until each has 9 cards. On your turn, follow these steps in order:  

1. Spend a Key (optional)  
   - Spend 1 Key to either:  
     a) Move the Messenger pawn to the other location (Castle ↔ Village).  
     b) Discard all 3 face-up cards in the current Messenger location and reveal 3 new cards from that deck.

2. Buy a Card (mandatory)  
   - Take one of the 3 face-up cards in the location where the Messenger pawn is.  
   - Pay its Gold cost (top-left corner).  
   - Discounts from previously placed cards reduce cost (minimum 0 Gold).  
   - A card’s own discount does not apply to its purchase.  
   - Alternatively, take a card face down: pay nothing, gain 6 Gold and 2 Keys, but it scores 0 points and has no ability.

3. Apply the Card's Ability (mandatory)  
   - Resolve the card’s ability immediately after placing it.  
   - The card counts itself unless the ability is a discount.  
   - Abilities scale based on your tableau unless otherwise specified.  
   - "Opponents" refers to all other players; "neighbor" means left or right player (you choose).

4. Move the Messenger & Refill Displays (mandatory)  
   - If the purchased card has a Messenger icon, move the pawn to the indicated location (gray = Castle, brown = Village).  
   - If the card was taken face down or has no icon, the pawn does not move.  
   - Refill both Castle and Village displays to 3 face-up cards using their respective decks.

Edge Case – Empty Location  
If a deck is exhausted and its discard pile is shuffled but still cannot refill to 3 cards, remove that location from the game. The Messenger remains by the remaining location. Messenger icons no longer affect movement. Spending a Key still refreshes the remaining row.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Tableau Placement:  
  - First card can go anywhere.  
  - Subsequent cards must be orthogonally adjacent to an existing card.  
  - Final layout must be a 3×3 grid (max 3 per row/column).  
  - Position matters for scoring (e.g., corners, center).

- Discounts:  
  - Stack all applicable discounts (Castle, Village, or both).  
  - Cannot reduce cost below 0 Gold; no refund.

- Icon Reference (Key Abilities):  
  - Gain 1 Gold / 2 Keys / 3 points  
  - Castle/Village Banner (type identifier)  
  - Discount icons (Castle, Village, or both)  
  - Per: Nobility, Scholarship, Faith, Military, Craftsmanship, Peasantry shields  
  - Per different shield type in tableau  
  - Per different shield type absent from tableau  
  - Per set of 1 Scholarship + 1 Peasantry  
  - Per set of 3 identical shields  
  - Scoring by row/column:  
    - Scholarship on all 3 cards in a row  
    - Different shield types in a column  
    - Faith on all 5 cards in a cross (row + column)  
  - Purse: Store leftover Gold at game end (capacity printed)  
    - Gain points per Gold stored (e.g., 2 pts per Gold)  
    - Gain 1 pt per Gold across all purse cards  
  - Positional scoring: if card is in one of specified grid positions  
  - Card types: 1 shield, 2 shields, cost 0, cost 4, cost 5+, has discount, face-down, has purse  
  - Discard actions: choose 1 card to discard from Castle or Village row

6. Scoring & End Game  
After all players have 9 cards:  
- Place leftover Gold on purse-scoring cards (up to printed capacity).  
- Score each card using its red-numbered scoring scroll.  
- Each Key = 1 point.  
- Unstored Gold = 0 points (but used for tiebreaks).  
- Face-down cards = 0 points (except via Carpenter effect, not detailed here).  

Final Score = Sum of all card points + Key points.  
Tiebreaker: Most leftover Gold. If still tied, players share victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I use a discount on a face-down card? No – face-down cards are taken without cost.  
- Do I apply ability if I take a card face down? No – all effects are ignored.  
- Can I place a card not adjacent? No – all except the first must be orthogonally adjacent.  
- Does a card count itself for its ability? Yes, unless it's a discount.  
- Can I move the Messenger twice in one turn? No – only one Key may be spent per turn.  
- What if both decks are empty? Game continues until all players have 9 cards. Refill only when possible.
