3. **Starting Player**:
   - Randomly choose first player (receives Starting Player Token and 6 Coins).
   - 2nd player receives 7 Coins.
   - 3rd and 4th players receive 8 Coins each.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- **Rounds**: The game is played over 2 Rounds. Each Round ends when a player moves their Ship to the last River space.
- **Turn Order**: Clockwise, starting with the first player.
- **Each Turn** consists of 3 Phases:
  1. **Phase A**: Move 1 Action Strip to the bottom of the Action Board. Pay VP penalty if moving one of the bottom two strips. Carry out all effects on the strip from left to right.
  2. **Phase B**: Move Ship up to the number of spaces indicated by the Action Strip. Must move at least 1 space. Gain reward from the space where movement ends.
     - Skip spaces with other players’ Ships (except Harbors).
     - In Round 1, take upper river arm at fork; in Round 2, take lower arm.
     - If first to cross a Lock in a Round, trigger Interim Scoring after completing Phase B.
     - If Ship reaches final space, the Round ends after Phase C.
  3. **Phase C**: Push Action Strips up to close the gap, restoring one strip per row.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Action Types** (determined by Action Strip):
  - **Play/Discard Card**: Optional card play or discard for 2 Coins (except Builder).
  - **Primary Action**: Only active player performs.
  - **Secondary Action**: All players may perform, starting with active player (except Pioneer).
- **Key Actions**:
  - **Explore**: Reveal gray Building Tile, place adjacent to existing tile or via bridge. Gain reward.
  - **Develop**: Place 1 Inhabitant from Ranch on unoccupied Building Site. Pay cost or gain reward.
  - **Upgrade**:
    - *Inhabitant to House*: Pay 1 Inhabitant from Ranch. Replace Inhabitant with House from topmost non-vacated tier.
    - *House to Settlement*: Pay 2 Inhabitants from Ranch. Must be adjacent to ≥3 Presences (any player). 3rd Settlement: +1 Inhabitant or 4 VP; 4th: +2 Inhabitants, or 1 Inhabitant + 4 VP, or 8 VP. If another Settlement already in Region, lose 5 VP.
  - **Cattle-Breeding**:
    - Place Cattle Pasture Tile on unoccupied adjacent space. Gain reward.
    - Place 1 Cattle: Choose Pasture with ≤3 Cattle. Pay Inhabitants based on current Cattle count (0:1, 1:2, 2:3, 3:4). 4th Cattle: +1 Inhabitant or 4 VP; 5th: +2 Inhabitants, or 1 Inhabitant + 4 VP, or 8 VP. Gain 2 Coins per adjacent House (any player).
  - **Settle**: Choose Region with uncovered reward. Place Region Marker and gain reward. All players gain 1 Coin per Presence in the other 3 Regions.
  - **Hire**: Gain 1 Inhabitant and Explore once. All players may pay 3 Coins or discard 3 Cards to gain 1 Inhabitant.
  - **Progress**: Modernize (place Lever) once. All players may Modernize once by paying 1 Inhabitant or drawing 1 Card.
  - **Builder**: Gain 3 Coins. Play 1 Card or draw 2 Cards. All players may play/discard 1 Card for 2 Coins.
- **Special Projects**:
  - On Scoring Tiles: Instead of playing a card, pay costs to realize a project. Gain 2 Inhabitants (1 to Ranch, 1 to project space), VP, and advance 1 space on Income Track. If it’s your chosen Scoring Tile, VP is doubled.
- **Tier Bonus**:
  - If all pieces are removed from Tier 1 or 2 of Player Board, move the adjacent Inhabitant to Ranch.
- **Lever Use**:
  - Levers provide one-time effects (e.g., reduce costs, gain resources, facilitate upgrades). Used by moving lever down. Reset at each Interim Scoring.
- **Ship Movement**:
  - Maximum movement = number on Action Strip.
  - Harbors can hold multiple Ships; other spaces hold one.
  - Move downriver only. Cannot exceed final space.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Interim Scoring** (4 total: 2 per Round):
  - Triggered when first player crosses a Lock in a Round.
  - After 4th Interim Scoring, Round continues until all players have equal turns. Final Interim Scoring then occurs.
  - Steps:
    1. Each player may play 1 Card or Upgrade (can do both once).
    2. Score 1 Scoring Tile:
       - Take lowest-numbered available Scoring Marker (1–4 VP).
       - Place on unclaimed space under any Scoring Tile.
       - Gain or lose VP based on condition. If it’s your chosen Scoring Tile, VP is doubled.
    3. Receive Income:
