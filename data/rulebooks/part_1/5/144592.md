### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:

#### Phase A: Stock Exchange  
1. Reveal top Stock Exchange card.  
2. First player selects one of two coordinate intersections (based on player count).  
3. Place bracket so the right angle encloses the largest possible area on the Art Nouveau board. This defines the active play area.

#### Phase B: Action Phase  
Players take turns clockwise, choosing one of the following:  
- Place an assistant on the **Art Nouveau Board**  
- Place an assistant on the **Brussels Board**  
- **Pass**

##### Art Nouveau Board  
- Each space can be used only once per game.  
- To take an action:  
  - Place assistant on an unoccupied space within the active bracket.  
  - Place a bid of at least 1 BF.  
  - Take the action immediately (optional).  
- Secondary Actions: If another player uses a space where you have a building, you may trigger your bonus.  
- Actions:  
  - **Workshop**: Draw 1 colored artwork + 1 extra per exhibition tile you own. Choose 1 to keep; return others to bottom of stack.  
  - **Sale**: Move workshop cursor orthogonally a number of spaces equal to your artworks. Sell one artwork of a color not currently displayed in the shop. Earn VP and BF based on cursor position. Place artwork in a shop window.  
  - **Royal Theatre**: Pay row cost (in BF) to take a public figure card. Immediately use its ability. Then:  
    - Discard it, or  
    - Rotate 90° and keep it (must pay upkeep at game end).  
    - Slide cards right; refill from deck.  
  - **Materials**: Take 2 noble materials of your choice.  
  - **Construction**:  
    - Pay construction cost (based on building row and compass).  
    - White cubes (jokers) can substitute for any material.  
    - If no jokers used, score 5 VP.  
    - Rotate one compass pointer clockwise (cannot overlap with other).  
    - Place building on any unoccupied space.  

##### Brussels Board  
- Spaces can be used multiple times.  
- Cost increases with usage:  
  - 2–3 players: Each use requires 1 more assistant than previous.  
  - 4–5 players: First two uses cost 1 assistant; third and fourth cost 2; fifth and sixth cost 3.  
- No bidding required.  
- Actions:  
  - **Market**: Gain 3 white joker materials.  
  - **Stock Exchange**: Gain BF amount shown on current Stock Exchange card.  
  - **50th Anniversary Park**: Choose any one action from the Art Nouveau Board (no bid, no auction).  
  - **Grand Plaza**: Activate up to N public figures (where N = your Royal Palace track position). Rotate each used figure 90°.

##### Passing  
- First player to pass:  
  - Takes current exhibition tile.  
  - Gains 1 BF + 1 BF per different color of artwork in their possession.  
- Other players: Gain 1 BF per different color of artwork when they pass.

   - Player with most symbols becomes new first player.  
   - Tie: closest clockwise from current first player.  
3. **Use Bonus Cards**:  
   - **Tuck**: Place under one of the four end-game scoring rows on your board (max 1 per row per round). Increases end-game multiplier.
