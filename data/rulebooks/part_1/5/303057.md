## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Pan Am was the world's first global airline, pioneering air routes across continents. In this game, players lead fledgling airlines competing during Pan Am’s rise from 1927 to 1968. The goal is twofold:
1. Claim Routes by acquiring Airports, Planes, and Destinations.
2. Use income from operating and selling Routes to buy Pan Am Stock.

The player with the most Stock at the end of seven rounds wins.

   - Randomly select one Event card per round (1–7) and stack them face down.
   - Shuffle Destination cards and place in a face-down deck at Destinations (B); flip four face up.
   - Shuffle Directive cards and place face down at Directives (E).
   - Place Pan Am Route Markers, Money, Stock, Pan Am Die, and Stock Marker near the board.
   - Place Cruiser and Jet Tiles over their respective bidding tracks in the Planes (C) area.

2. **Player Setup**:
   - Each player takes:
     - A player mat and matching-colored components.
     - 2 Trimotors and 1 Clipper placed on their fleet; remaining planes go to hangars.
     - 5 Airports placed near Airports (A).
     - Income Tracker on 0.
     - Engineers: 5 (2 players), 4 (3 players), 3 (4 players).
   - Each player draws:
     - 2 Destination cards (face up).
     - 1 Directive card (kept hidden).
     - $12.
   - The player who most recently flew becomes the first player and takes the First Player Marker.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the 7 rounds has four phases:

**1. Event Phase**
- Reveal the top Event card.
- Resolve the Event immediately unless otherwise stated.
- Adjust Stock Price as indicated:
  - ↑: Increase by $1.
  - ↓: Decrease by $1.
  - Number: Set Stock Price to that value.

**2. Engineer Phase**
- **Priority Access Step** (skip in Round 1):
  - Players with Engineers in Directives (E) from the prior round assign them first, left to right, to any space in areas A–D.
- **Assignment Step**:
  - Starting with the first player, players take turns placing one Engineer at a time into areas A–E.
  - **Bidding Tracks (A–C)**: Spaces indicate cost. To place on an occupied track, place on a higher space; the lower Engineer returns to its owner.
  - **Work Sites (D–E)**: Engineers placed left to right in empty spaces.
  - Players pass when out of Engineers.
  - Unassigned Engineers are set aside and returned next round.

**3. Resolution Phase**
Resolve Engineers in order: A → B → C → D → E.

- **If unable to pay bid**:
  - Sell Stock at current price minus $2 per share.
  - If still insufficient, lose all money and fail to gain the action’s benefit.
  - Selling Stock is only allowed at this time.

**A. Airports**:
- Pay bid cost.
- Place an Airport on any unoccupied city. If none available, move an existing Airport.
- Take back Engineer.
- Increase Income by 1 only if placing a new Airport (not when moving).

**B. Destinations**:
- Pay bid cost.
- Take the Destination card and any bonus money shown.
- Take back Engineer.
- After all resolutions: Add $1 to each remaining face-up Destination card; refill empty slots from the deck.

**C. Planes**:
- Pay bid cost.
- Take a Plane of the bid type and place it on your fleet.
- If no planes of that type remain, pay but gain nothing.
- Take back Engineer.
- **Availability**:
  - Cruisers available starting Round 3 (remove tile at end of Round 2).
  - Jets available starting Round 6 (remove tile at end of Round 5).

**D. Routes**:
- Must have:
  - A Plane with range ≥ Route distance.
  - Landing Rights in both cities.
- **Landing Rights methods**:
  1. Your Airport in the city.
  2. Own the city’s Destination card (not discarded).
  3. Discard one Destination card from the same region as the city (grants rights for one Route).
  4. Discard two Destination cards of the same region (different from city’s region) (grants rights for one Route).
- Discard required cards.
- Place a Plane on the Route’s distance diamond.
- Increase Income by the Route’s distance.
- Take back Engineer.

**E. Directives**:
- Draw a Directive card (keep hidden).
- Do **not** take back Engineer—remains for Priority Access next round.

**4. Pan Am Phase**
- **Expansion Step**:
  - Roll the Pan Am Die the number of times shown on the Event card.
  - Die symbols:
    - Path symbols (South American, European, Asian-Pacific): Follow path from Miami until an unclaimed Route is found. Pan Am claims it.
      - If claimed by a player, that player sells it to Pan Am.
    - Pan Am symbol: Each player, starting with the first, may sell one Route (anywhere) to Pan Am.
  - **Selling to Pan Am**:
    - Earn Route Bonus: Distance 1 → $5, 2 → $9, 3 → $12, 4 → $14.
    - Replace your Plane with a Pan Am Route Marker; return Plane to your fleet.
    - Reduce Income by the Route’s distance.
    - Pan Am Routes are permanently blocked.
- **Income Step**:
  - Each player earns cash equal to their Income Tracker value.
- **Stock Step**:
  - Starting with the first player, each may buy any amount of Stock at current price.

**End of Round**:
- Pass First Player Marker clockwise.
- Remove Cruiser Tile at end of Round 2; remove Jet Tile at end of Round 5.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Engineers**: Primary action enablers; placed during Engineer Phase, resolved in Resolution Phase.
- **Bidding Tracks**: Competitive placement; higher bids displace lower ones.
- **Landing Rights**: Required to claim Routes; obtained via Airports, matching Destination cards, or discards.
- **Route Claiming**: Core action; requires Plane and Landing Rights.
- **Stock Market**: Dynamic pricing via Event cards; buying occurs every round.
- **Pan Am Expansion**: Forces route sales and income reduction; drives strategic route selection.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends after Round 7.
- **Winner**: Player with the most Stock.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Most Money.
  2. Shared victory if still tied.

**Income Recalculation**:
- Income = Number of Airports on board + Sum of distances of all claimed Routes.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I claim a Route without Landing Rights?**
  - Only if a card (Event or Directive) allows a "free Route"—then no Landing Rights needed.
- **Can I upgrade a Plane not in my fleet?**
  - No. Only Planes currently on your player mat can be upgraded.
- **Can I upgrade to a Plane not yet available?**
  - No. Cannot upgrade to Cruisers before Round 3 or Jets before Round 6.
- **What happens if I can't pay for a bid?**
  - Sell Stock at current price minus $2. If still short, lose all money and gain no benefit.
- **Can I sell Stock outside the Resolution Phase?**
  - No. Only when failing to pay a bid.
- **Can I claim a Route longer than my Plane’s range?**
  - No. Plane range must be ≥ Route distance.
- **Do discarded Destination cards go to a discard pile?**
  - Yes, but no mechanic uses the discard pile; assume reshuffled when needed.
- **Can I use a Directive card without an Engineer in the correct area?**
  - Only if the card does not require resolving an Engineer. Cards that say “when resolving an Engineer” require one in that area.
