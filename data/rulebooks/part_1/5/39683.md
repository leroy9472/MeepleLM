   - Take 5 Cash and 1 Loan card  
   - At end of game, move Scoring marker back 1 space per Loan

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Path of Prosperity**: Main scoring track; movement costs increase per space
- **Card Acquisition**: Via Card phase (4 cards, play 2) or Two-pack (cost based on Helpers/Market Stalls)
- **Vegetable Economy**: Grow → Harvest → Sell/Trade/Deliver → Earn Cash
- **Storage**: Storehouse limits carryover; upgrade from 1 to 4 for 2 Cash
- **Customer Types**:  
  - Regular: 4-round commitment, penalty for missed delivery  
  - Casual: one-time, bonus/penalty based on customer balance
- **Helpers**: One-time use abilities; only cards that can be discarded freely
- **Two-pack**: Strategic card draw; stacking allows delayed use

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends after Round 9 (when Home Field is fully harvested)
- **Final Scoring**:
  1. Move Scoring marker back 1 space per Loan card
  2. Player farthest on Path wins
- **Tiebreakers**:

  2. Most vegetables in fields and Storehouse
  3. If still tied, players share victory
