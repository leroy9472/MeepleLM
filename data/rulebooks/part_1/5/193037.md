## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Dead of Winter is a thematic survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. Players are leaders of a colony of survivors, working together to fulfill a main objective while managing limited resources, morale, and crises. However, among them may be a betrayer working toward a secret personal goal. The game balances cooperation with hidden agendas.

The game ends immediately when any of the following occur:
- Morale track reaches zero
- Round track reaches zero
- Main objective is completed (checked during Colony Phase)

Win/Lose Condition:  
Each player wins only if they complete their **secret objective**, regardless of whether the main objective is achieved. If a player fails their secret objective, they lose.

**Roll Action Dice**  
- Each player rolls 1 die + 1 per survivor they control. All dice go into a shared unused pool.

**Player Turns**  
- Starting with first player, each takes any number of actions before passing.

   - If two dice on Raxxon match code on top experiment card:  
     - Vote: Thumbs Up → discard card safely

   - Unruly Helpless Survivors count as 2  
   - If insufficient food:  
     - Add starvation token to food supply  
     - Decrease morale by number of starvation tokens present  
3. **Check Waste**:  
   - For every 10 cards (rounded down), decrease morale by 1  
4. **Resolve Crisis**:  
   - Shuffle all contributed cards, reveal one at a time  
   - +1 for matching symbol, -1 for non-matching  
   - If total ≥ number of non-exiled players → crisis prevented  
     - If total ≥ players +2 → gain 1 morale  
   - Contributed cards are removed from game  
5. **Add Zombies**:
