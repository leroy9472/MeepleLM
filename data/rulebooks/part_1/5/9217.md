## Saint Petersburg — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In Saint Petersburg, players take on roles in building Czar Peter the Great’s new capital. By acquiring workers (income), buildings (victory points), and aristocrats (mixed rewards), players aim to maximize their victory points. The game simulates economic development and strategic planning during a transformative era. The player with the most victory points at the end wins.

     - 4 players: 8 cards

     - 2 players: 4 cards  
   - Rotate the Worker deck 90° to indicate the starting phase.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of 4 phases in fixed order:  
1. Worker Phase  
2. Building Phase  
3. Aristocrat Phase  
4. Trading Card Phase  

Each phase proceeds as follows:  

#### (1) Actions Phase  
- The player holding the phase's Start Player marker acts first; play proceeds clockwise.  
- On their turn, a player chooses one of:  
  a) **Buy a card**: Pay cost (top-left number), place card in play area.  
  b) **Add to hand**: Take 1 card from board (any row), add to hand (free).  
  c) **Play from hand**: Pay cost, place 1 card from hand into play area.  
  d) **Pass**: May act again later.  
- Actions continue until all players pass consecutively.  

#### (2) Scoring  
- **Worker Phase**: Score all Workers (coin value = rubles from bank).  
- **Building Phase**: Score all Buildings (shield value = VPs, advance on track).  
- **Aristocrat Phase**: Score all Aristocrats (coin and/or shield values).  
- Scoring includes all cards played in current and prior rounds.  
- Start player scores first; others follow clockwise.  

#### (3) Card Renewal  
- Dealer adds cards from the *next* deck to the *top row* until there are 8 cards total on the board.  
- Remaining cards from previous phase are shifted to the right (no row change).  
- Rotate the *current* deck back to flat position; rotate the *next* deck 90° to indicate next phase.  

#### (4) End of Trading Phase → End of Round  
- Discard all cards in the bottom row.  
- Move all remaining cards from top row to bottom row (shifted right).  
- Add Worker cards to top row to total 8 cards.  
- Rotate Worker deck 90°.  
- Players pass Start Player markers:  
  - 2–4 players: pass left to next player  
  - 5 players: pass two left (not applicable here; max 4 in sources)  
- New round begins with Worker phase.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Costs & Discounts  
- Base cost is top-left number.  
- Discounts are cumulative, but minimum cost is **1 ruble**.  
- Discounts:  
  - −1 ruble per identical card (same name/illustration) already in play  
  - −1 ruble if bought from bottom row  
  - −1 ruble per relevant special building:  
    - Carpenter Workshop: −1 to all Building purchases  
    - Gold Smelter: −1 to all Aristocrat purchases  

#### Trading (Exchange) Cards  
- Cannot be placed directly; must **replace** an existing card of same color:  
  - Blue (Building) trading card → replace any Building  
  - Orange (Aristocrat) trading card → replace any Aristocrat  
  - Green (Worker) trading card → replace only matching symbol (e.g., Lumberjack → Carpenter Workshop)  
- Cannot replace another trading card.  
- Cost:  
  - If trading card cost > replaced card cost: pay difference  
  - If trading card cost ≤ replaced card cost: pay 1 ruble  
- All normal discounts apply.  

#### Hand Rules  
- Max hand size: 3 cards  
- **Warehouse** card increases hand limit to 4  
- Cards in hand cannot be discarded except by playing them  
- At game end: −5 VP per card in hand  

#### Special Cards  
- **Aristocrats Love Theater**: During Building scoring, gain 1 ruble per Aristocrat in play  
- **Unattractive Job, But**: During Aristocrat scoring, gain 1 ruble per Worker in play  
- **Virtual Village Pays for Itself**: Pay 2 rubles to play. If replaced by trading card, worth 6 rubles  
- **Good, But Dangerous**: Hand limit increased to 4  
- **Don’t Spend Too Much**: After each Building scoring, may buy up to 5 VPs at 2 rubles each (cannot sell VPs for money)  
- **Czar Peter Can Do It All**: Can be replaced by any green (Worker) trading card  
- **Observatory**:  
  - Worth 1 VP if ability not used  
  - During Building phase, instead of normal action, may draw top card from any deck (not last card), then buy, add to hand, or discard  
  - After use, flip face-down (no VP). Turn face-up at start of next round  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game ends** when the Dealer places the **last card** of any deck (Worker, Building, Aristocrat, or Trading).  
- Complete all phases of the current round.  
- Then perform final scoring:  
  a) **Aristocrats**: Score VPs based on number of *different* aristocrats (see board table).  
     - 5-player variant: +10 VP per different aristocrat above 10 (not applicable here)  
  b) **Money**: 1 VP per full 10 rubles  
  c) **Hand cards**: −5 VP per card in hand  
- **Total** all VPs (including track). Highest wins.  

#### Tiebreakers (in order):  
1. Most money  
2. Most aristocrats (total, not unique)  
3. Most buildings  
4. Most workers  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **No cards bought or added in a phase?**  
  - Still score normally. Dealer adds no new cards but rotates decks to indicate phase change.  
- **Can you play a card from hand in a different phase than its type?**  
  - Yes. Any card can be played from hand in any phase.  
- **Can you buy a Worker in the Building phase?**  
  - Yes. Any non-purple card can be bought in any phase.  
- **Can you pass and then act later?**  
  - Yes. Passing does not lock you out; you may act when your turn comes again.  
- **Can you use Observatory if only one card remains in a deck?**  
  - No. You cannot draw the *last* card of any deck with Observatory.  
- **What if not enough cards to refill to 8?**  
  - Add as many as available. Game continues normally.
