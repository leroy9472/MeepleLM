4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of 5 phases:

**PHASE 0 – EVENT**  
- Start player reveals top Event Card  
- Resolve immediately (in turn order) or apply effect for the round  
- If card adds a Good, place it on Neutral Trading Space (if available)

**PHASE 1 – DRAWING (Simultaneous)**  
1. Retrieve:  
   - Move any Goods from Action Spaces (Action Board, Role, Extensions, Assets, Traveller Strip) to unoccupied Planning Spaces  
   - Return unused Coins from Assets/Extensions to supply  
2. Draw:  
   - Draw random tiles from bag to fill unoccupied Planning Spaces  
   - If bag is empty, empty Container into bag and continue drawing  
   - If still insufficient, leave spaces empty  

**PHASE 2 – PLANNING (Simultaneous)**  
- Move Goods/Coins from Planning Spaces to Action Spaces (Action Board, Role, Extensions, Assets, Traveller Strip)  
- Coins required for Extensions/Assets must be placed now  
- Cannot relocate tiles from previous rounds  
- Players declare planning complete in turn order (start player first)  

**PHASE 3 – ACTIONS (Turn Order)**  
- Start player takes first action; play proceeds clockwise  
- On your turn, take 1 Action or Pass  
- Once passed, no further actions  
- Phase ends when all players have passed  

Before your first action, place your Player Pawn on any Location.  
Before/after any action, you may move:  
- **By Foot**: Discard 1 Food to move 1 space  
- **By Cart**: Use 1 Cart to move 1–3 spaces (first Cart free; each additional requires 1 Food)  

To take an action:  
- Meet its requirements (tiles/coins placed)  
- Your Player Pawn must be at the correct Location (including for Role/Extension actions)  
- For Traveller actions: Pawn must be at Traveller's Location, or use an Extension with extra Traveller Action space  

After action:  
- Place used tiles and newly gained tiles into Container  
- Coins gained go to supply; spent coins return to supply  

**PHASE 4 – CLEANUP**  
1. Pass Start Player Marker to left  
2. Reset all Carts (slide back to left)  
3. Refill Extension Strip:  
   - If ≥1 Extension bought: slide down, refill from stack  
   - If none bought: discard bottom Extension, slide down, refill  
4. Move Traveller Pawn clockwise to next unoccupied Location  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Movement**: Use Food (1 per space) or Carts (1–3 spaces; first free, others cost 1 Food)  
- **Action Spaces**: Use tiles/coins placed during Planning to activate actions  
- **Goods Flow**:  
  - Gained goods go to Container  
  - Container feeds bag when empty  
  - Warehouse stores completed rows  
- **Extensions**:  
  - Buy 1 per round at Market  
  - Pay cost on tile + slot cost on Extension Strip  
  - Cannot duplicate Role or existing Extension actions  
- **Orders**:  
  - Only 1 unfulfilled Order at a time  
  - Deliver goods over multiple actions  
  - On completion: gain 1 Corn, store immediately  
- **Road Construction**:  
  - Spend 1 Stone + 1 Wood to advance Road Marker  
  - Reward: 1 extra Planning Space or 1 Corn (immediately stored)  
- **Storing Goods**:  
  - Use "Store Goods" action at Village  
  - Store from bottom-left to top-right  
  - One Good type per row (except Corn)  
  - First tile in row determines type  
  - Cannot start new row for a Good with incomplete row  
  - Corn:  
    - Must be stored immediately (unless using temporary storage Extension)  
    - Can fill any row (except Corn-only rows)  
    - If row started with Corn, only Corn may be stored there until completed  
- **Traveller Actions**:  
  - Buy Opals: Spend any number of Goods to gain 1 Opal per Good  
  - Spend Opals:  
    - 1 Opal → 1 low-value Good (from Neutral or opponent’s Trading Post)  
    - 2 Opals → 1 high-value Good (from Neutral or opponent’s Trading Post)  
  - Buy Asset: Spend 1 Good to gain 1 Asset Card (Stage I only; Stage II unlocked later)  
  - Only 1 Traveller action per round  

6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger**:  
- Any Location depleted of all items (tiles, cards, carts)  
- Not enough Extensions to refill Extension Strip  
→ Finish current round, then play 1 final round. Then score.

**Final Scoring**:
