   - Any number of Quick Actions (see below)  
3. May skip either or both of Basic Action and Special Effect.  

After all players have played 5 cards, proceed to End Round Phase.

#### End Round Phase (Simultaneous)  
All players:  
1. **Tuck 1 played card** under the leftmost slot of Study Board (symbol remains active; special effect lost).  
2. Return remaining 4 played cards to hand.  
3. **Receive Income**:  
   - From completed rows/columns on Bookshelf (per arrow rewards)  
   - From Income tiles in ! slots

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Basic Actions (based on symbols visible on Desk)  
Action value = number of matching symbols on Desk (including current card), unless otherwise specified. May use lower value.  

**Work (Ruler & Pencil)**  
- Move Work Marker forward up to action value.  
- Gain **coins = spaces moved**.  
- Special Spaces: must stop to activate.  
- Objective Space: must meet volume requirement (3 Green, 1 Blue; potions = 1 volume each).  
- Even if at end, can still perform to gain coins.  

**Technology (Cog)**  
- Move **1 Student** forward up to action value.  
- Cannot split between Students unless using Edmond Halley.  
- Collect Bonus tokens when passed or landed on.  
- Must stop on Special/Master spaces to activate.  
- Objective Space: meet volume requirement (varies).  
- Max 1 Student of same color on final space of each path.  

**Travel (Compass)**  
- Move Scientist up to action value.  
- Pay travel costs (coins) along route before moving.  
- Collect Bonus tokens when passed or landed on.  
- Place Travel cube only when **stopping** on:  
  - City, University, Ancient Land, Objective, Master space  
  - Take immediate bonus from City tile if placing cube  
- Cannot place cube on space already occupied by own cube  
- VP rewards for placing 9th–12th cubes: 1/2/4/8 VP  
- No limit on Scientists per space  

**Lessons (Graduation Cap)**  
- Take **1 face-up Action card** of value ≤ action value.  
- Card goes to hand; not replaced until End Round Phase.  

**Study (Book)**  
- Place **1 Bookshelf tile** on shelf level ≤ action value.  
- Must satisfy space requirement:  
  - Volume (colored books): must have on Desk or Master cards  
  - University/Ancient Land: must have cube on space  
  - Use 1 Potion = 1 Volume (multiple times)  
  - Use 3 Potions = 1 University/Ancient Land requirement  
- Take bonus if tile uncovers one (e.g., immediate coin)  
- Only 1 tile per action  

**Joker (Jester Cap)**  
- Can be used as any Basic Action type.  
- Counts toward symbol count **only when played**.  
- After tucking or staying on board, **does not count** toward future action values.  

#### Special Effects (Top of Action Cards)  
Active **only during the turn the card is played**, unless otherwise noted.  
Examples:  
- Spend 3 Coins → place second Bookshelf tile (split action value)  
- Gain 1 VP per available volume of shown color (from Desk + Masters)  
- Spend 2 Coins → place second Travel cube during this action  
- Discard card → take any face-up Action card  

#### Quick Actions (May Perform Any Number, 1x Exception)  
- **Flip 2 Cards**: Spend 1 Coin → reveal 2 face-down Action cards from any deck  
- **+1 Action Boost**: Spend 2 Coins → increase current Basic Action value by 1 (**once per turn**)  
  - Cannot boost tile/Master card actions  
- **Buy Potion**: Spend 3 Coins → gain 1 Potion  
- **Enroll Student**: Spend 5 Coins → place 1 Student from supply on Start of Technology Track  

#### Master Cards  
Played by:  
- Landing on Master space (Work, Tech, Map)  
- Placing 9th Bookshelf tile  
- Using Special Action: "Spend 3 Coins to activate effect of a played Master card"  
- Using William Gilbert or Maria Winkelmann  

Once played, card is discarded and grants VP at end of game (value on card).  
Effects are **one-time use**.  

Key Examples:  
- **Robert Boyle**: Study 4, split among multiple books; must meet requirements  
- **Edmond Halley**: Technology 4, split among multiple Students  
- **René Descartes**: Lessons 1 → immediately perform Basic Action of chosen card (value = symbols on Desk +1)  
- **Maria Winkelmann**: Place Travel cube on any valid space (not Master or Objective)  
- **Galileo Galilei**: Travel 3 → place cube on each space passed (only valid spaces)  
- **Blaise Pascal**: Travel 5 → no cost to move  

#### Specialization Tiles  
Two types:  
- **! Mark**: Take matching **Income tile**, place in ! slot on Study Board (recurring income)  
- **Development icon**: Take matching **Development tile**, place in leftmost free drawer slot  

Only 4 of each Income type available; if exhausted, no more can be taken.

- **"5 VP per Ancient Land visited"**: 5 VP × number of Ancient Lands with your cube  
- **"4 VP per Student at end of Tech Track"**: 4 VP × number of Students on final space  
- **"4 VP per Master card played"**: 4 VP × number of played Master cards  
- **"5 VP per 3 different volumes"**: 5 VP per 3 distinct colors (from Action cards in hand + played + Master cards)  
- **"3 VP per pair of Action cards"**: 3 VP per pair (round down); exclude Starting Action cards  
- **"2 VP per Potion in supply"**: Max 14 VP  
- **"2 VP per Bonus token"**: Max 14 VP  
- **"4 VP per 3 Book tiles placed"**: 4 VP per 3 placed (total)

- 1 VP per **unvisited** University  
- 1 VP per **empty income slot**  
- 2 VP per **unreached Special Space** on Work Track (4 total)  
- 2 VP per **Student still in supply**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I use coins earned during a Work action to pay for +1 boost?**  
A: No. All costs must be paid before performing the action.  

**Q: Can I use a potion from income just earned to satisfy a Study requirement?**  
A: No. Requirements and payments are resolved before effects.  

**Q: Can I place a cube on a space I pass through using Galileo Galilei?**  
A: Yes, but only on valid spaces (City, University, etc.), not Villages.  

**Q: Can I place a Travel cube on a space already occupied by my Scientist but not my cube?**  
A: Yes, if you stop there.  

**Q: Can I move a Travel cube if I run out?**  
A: Yes. Move any of your existing cubes to a new location (you lose presence at old location).  

**Q: Does Robert Boyle’s split action allow using potion after first book?**  
A: No. All costs must be paid before action begins.  

**Q: Does René Descartes’ chosen card count toward symbol total?**  
A: Yes. The card is used for its action, but not played — it stays in hand.  

**Q: Can I use Special Action to activate a Master card not yet played?**  
A: No. Only **played** Master cards can be activated this way.  

**Q: Can I use Maria Winkelmann to place cube on City and get bonus?**  
A: Yes. Placing a cube (by any means) triggers City tile bonus.  

**Q: Can I use Stephen Hawking to move a book to a space with requirement?**  
A: Yes. Requirement is ignored.
