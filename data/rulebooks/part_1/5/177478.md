# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In *IKI: A Game of Edo Artisans*, players take on the role of Oyakata (masters) managing a row of artisans and shopkeepers in Edo-era Japan. The goal is to accumulate the most *IKI points*—a measure of cultural refinement and success—over the course of a year (13 rounds). The player with the highest IKI score at the end of the New Year's round wins. In case of a tie, victory is determined first by highest firefighting power, then by the player whose marker is on top of the stack if tied.

   - General Supply: Remaining Mon, rice, sandals, lumber, Koban go to bank (Bugyo-sho).

6. **Player Order**:
   - Round 1: Starting player is “best craftsman” (random or agreed). Play proceeds clockwise.
   - From Round 2 onward: Player order determined by Firefighting Power (highest first; ties broken by topmost marker).

7. **Special Setup for Player Count**:
   - **2–3 Players**: Block the "X" space on the Way of Life Track.
   - **2 Players Only**:
     - Block the 4 central corner stalls (with unused Kobun).
     - Only 4 Nagaya groups are scored for harmony (no 5th group).

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the 13 rounds consists of two phases:

### Phase 1: The Way of Life
- Players place their cylinder on an empty space of the Way of Life Track in descending order of Firefighting Power.
- Spaces: "X" (1–4 movement, skip Step A), or 1, 2, 3, 4 (fixed movement).
- Only one cylinder per space.
- "X" space not used in 2–3 player games.

### Phase 2: Movement and Actions
Players take turns left to right on the Way of Life Track ("X", 1, 2, 3, 4).

#### Step A: Hiring or Income
- **Hiring**: Choose one face-up occupation card. Pay cost in Mon. Use coins on card toward payment. Place card in empty stall. Pay extra 2 Mon for central corner stalls. Place Kobun on first experience space. Gain firefighting bonus if shown.
- **Income**: Receive 4 Mon from bank.
- **Exception**: Players on "X" skip Step A.

#### Step B: Move Oyakata and Do Business
- **Move**: Move Oyakata exactly the number of spaces shown on Way of Life Track. Spend 1 Sandal token per additional space. Ox Cart ability allows +1 free movement.
- **Passing Start Point**: If Oyakata passes the starting point, all owned on-board occupation cards gain 1 experience. Retire if max level reached.
- **Do Business**: At destination space, may:
  - Use the Shop action.
  - Use one occupation card behind the shop (own or opponent’s).
  - Use both, in any order.
- **Using Opponent’s Card**: Their Kobun gains 1 experience after the deal. Own cards do not gain experience.
- **End Turn**: Return cylinder to player area.

### End of Round
- All players complete turns → round ends.
- **Non-Payday Month**:
  - Place 1 Mon on each unhired card (max 2 Mon per card).
  - Add 4 new cards of current season to hiring pool.
- **Payday Month (End of March, June, Sept, Dec)**:
  - Remove all fish, pipe, tobacco tokens; replace with next season’s.
  - Discard all unhired occupation cards; return coins to bank.
  - Replenish hiring pool with 4 cards of next season.
- **Fire Month (End of May, Aug, Nov)**:
  - Fire strength: May = 5, Aug = 8, Nov = 10.
  - Highest firefighting player draws a fire tile to determine affected Nagaya.
  - Fire starts at outer corner, spreads inward, strength –1 per space.
  - Fire stops if it hits a card whose owner has ≥ current fire strength.
  - Otherwise, card is destroyed (returned to owner), Kobun removed.
  - Fire dies at center regardless.
- Move Calendar to next month.

### Payday (End of Each Season)
Conducted in this order:
1. **Salary**:
   - Active cards: Pay salary based on current experience level.
   - Retired cards: Pay highest (rightmost) salary.
   - Grey salary spaces only active after retirement.
2. **Nagaya Harmony Bonus**:
   - 5 groups: 4 Nagayas + 1 group of 4 central corner stalls.
   - For each group, if ≥2 cards of same type (color), score:
     - Points = (Number of same-type cards) × (Number of your Kobun in group of that type).
   - Cards in central corners count in two groups.
3. **Food Payment**:
   - Pay 1 rice bale per active (non-retired) occupation card.
   - Cannot pay? Discard one card per missing rice bale (your choice).
   - Buildings and retired cards do not require rice.

### Final Round (New Year)
- Skip Phase 1.
- Players take turns in order of Firefighting Power (highest first).
- **No Step A** (no hiring or income).
- Move Oyakata to any space on Main Street.
- Do business as usual (shop and/or one occupation card).
- Passing start point does NOT trigger experience gain.
- Game ends after all players complete turn.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Occupation Cards
- **Types (by frame color)**:
  - Red: Master Craftsman
  - Brown: Artisan
  - Green: Shop Seller
  - Yellow: Street Peddler
  - Purple: Special
- **Hiring**: Pay cost, place in stall, place Kobun on leftmost experience space.
- **Experience Gain**:
  1. Opponent uses your card.
  2. Your Oyakata completes a circuit (passes start point).
  3. Pay 2 Mon to level up any card (via specific card ability).
- **Retirement**: When Kobun would advance beyond last space, retire card:
  - Remove from board.
  - Place in front of you (counts for endgame scoring).
  - Kobun returned to supply.
  - Still earns highest salary on future paydays.

### Construction Cards
- **Building Action**: Use hammer icon (from Construction Site or card ability).
- **Cost**: Pay resources shown.
- **Placement**: On empty stall. Pay 2 extra Mon for central corner.
- **Kobun**: Place one on card. Remains until game end or destruction.
- **Scoring**: Earn IKI points at game end as printed.
