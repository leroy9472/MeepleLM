## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Bonfires atop the towers of nearby cities have gone dark. As gnomes who depend on their light and energy, players journey to sacred islands to rekindle the Bonfires. The Guardians of Light have withdrawn and will only return faith to those who prove themselves through completing tasks. The objective is to ignite Bonfires, fulfill tasks, and earn the most points during final scoring.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

#### I. Place a Fate Tile  
- **Prerequisite**: You may have at most 1 Action Tile in your supply. You may discard excess at any time.  
- Take top or bottom Fate Tile from your personal supply.  
- Place it in your Fate Area:  
  - Must be orthogonally adjacent to at least one existing Fate Tile  
  - Must not extend beyond Fate Area boundary  
  - Must not cover another Fate Tile  
- Gain:  
  - Action Tiles shown on the placed Fate Tile  
  - Additional Action Tile for each symbol type in a connected group (including adjacent symbols on existing tiles)  
  - Gold or yellow Action Tile if placed over matching symbol in Fate Area  

#### II. Use Action Tiles (Choose one)  
- **Build a Path Tile**:  
  - Pay 1 green Action Tile (first 3 Path Tiles) or 2 (last 3)  
  - Take 1 face-up Path Tile or top of draw pile; connect to your Path  
  - Refill display if needed  
  - Max 6 Path Tiles per player  
  - *Special*: If all 4 display tiles show same crystal color, discard them and draw 4 new ones  

- **Move Ship**:  
  - First move: Pay 1 blue Action Tile to go to any island  
  - Subsequent:  
    - Pay 1: move 1 step along ship route  
    - Pay 2: move 2 steps  
    - Pay 3: move to any island  
  - **Free Extra Action** after moving:  
    - *Receive Task*: Ship on Task Island → pay red Action Tiles (1/2/3 for 1st/2nd/3rd Offering Tile) + Resource from Offering Tile and Island → replace Task with your Offering Tile (face down), take Task  
    - *Retrieve Guardian*: Ship on Guardian Island (color you don’t have) → pay 1 white Action Tile → take Guardian to Starting Tile  

- **Make Guardian Procession**:  
  - Pay 1+ white Action Tiles  
  - Move each Guardian up to that many steps forward  
  - Start with furthest-ahead Guardian  
  - Each Path Tile/Bonfire holds only 1 Guardian  
  - For each step, choose:  
    - Move forward → gain Resource if ends on Path Tile  
    - Move to adjacent Bonfire (requires Portal) → scores points at game end  

- **Use Great Bonfire**:  
  - First use: Pay 1 purple Action Tile to rotate to any space  
  - Subsequent:  
    - Pay 1: rotate 1 space clockwise  
    - Pay 2: rotate 2 spaces

#### III. Ignite a Bonfire  
- Flip a completed Task to Bonfire side  
- Take adjacent Novice and place on any High Council space without a Novice of your color  
- Gain bonus from that space (see Appendix II)  

**Bonus Action (Unlimited)**:  
- If you fulfill a Common Task and Neutral Novice is still present:  
  - Place Neutral Novice on High Council space without a Neutral Novice  
  - Gain bonus from that space  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Action Tile Substitution**:  
  - Missing Action Tile? Use 1 yellow or any 2 other Action Tiles  
  - Missing Resource? Use 1 Gold or any 2 other Resources  
- **Fate Area Expansion**: Strategic placement maximizes Action Tile gain via symbol grouping  
- **Task Fulfillment**: Conditions vary (Guardians, Portals, Gnomes, Resources, etc.)  
- **Procession**: Enables Resource gain and Guardian positioning for endgame points  
- **Great Bonfire Rotation**: Shared mechanism; enables Portal acquisition and rewards  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger**:  
- When High Council has:  
  - 1–2 players: 7 Novices  
  - 3 players: 10 Novices  
  - 4 players: 13 Novices  
- Starting Player takes Countdown Tiles and places pile on their Extension  
- After each Starting Player turn:  
  - Pass highest-numbered Countdown Tile clockwise  
  - Each player may pass instead of acting, gaining points equal to tile number  
  - When tile returns to Starting Player, return to box and pass next tile  
- Game ends when “1” tile is returned to box  

**Final Scoring**:  
- **Bonfires**: 2–8 points each (printed value)  
- **Guardians next to Bonfires**: 2–8 points each (as shown on board)  
- **Portals adjacent to Bonfires**: 2 points each  
- **Path Tiles with matching crystal color to adjacent Bonfire**: 2 points each  
- **Common Tasks fulfilled**: 4 points each  
  - Exception: “Have 7 Tasks or Bonfires” → 7 points if you have 7 Bonfires  
- **Fate Tiles in personal supply**: 3 points each  
- **Action Tiles/Resources in supply**: 1 point per 2 (round down)  

**Winning**:  
- Highest score wins  
- Tiebreaker: Most Bonfires
