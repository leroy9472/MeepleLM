## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *The Godfather: Corleone's Empire*, players take on the roles of rival crime families vying for control of New York City's underworld. Through strategic placement of family members and thugs, completing lucrative jobs, and bribing key allies, players expand their influence across seven city turfs. The goal is to amass the most money by the end of Act IV, including endgame bonuses for turf dominance and job completion.

### 2. Components
- Game board depicting 7 turfs (including Central Park)
- Don Corleone figure
- Police Car token

  **For 5 players**: Draw 3 blue tiles and place them on Turfs 1, 2, and 3 (Wall Street, Brooklyn, Upper East Side).
- Shuffle Job cards and place face-down stack by board. Reveal public Job cards:  
  2p = 2, 3–4p = 3, 5p = 4.
- Shuffle 6 Act I Ally cards; place face-up: 2p = 1, 3p = 2, 4p = 3, 5p = 4. Return remainder to box.
- Place neutral figures (Mayor, Union Boss, Police Chief) near board.
- Each player receives:
  - 1 metal suitcase
  - 9 control markers (3 in 2p)
  - 3 Family Member figures (keep Don in hand, place Consigliere on Act II and Heir on Act IV of Act Track)
  - 1 × $1, 1 × $2, 1 × $3 card
  - 2 random Job cards (kept hidden)
- Award Horse Head token to starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each Act consists of five phases in order:
1. **Open New Business**
2. **Family Business**
3. **Turf War**
4. **Bribery**
5. **Tribute to the Don**

After Act IV, proceed to endgame scoring.

#### 1. Open New Business
- Add one Business tile to the lowest-numbered available Turf.
- Acts I and II: use blue tiles.
- Acts III and IV: use red tiles.

#### 2. Family Business
- Starting with the first player, proceed clockwise.
- On a turn, a player performs **one** of the following actions:
  - Play a Thug
  - Play a Family Member
  - Complete a Job
  - Play an Ally
- Players **cannot pass**. Once a player has no remaining Family Members or Thugs, they are skipped for the rest of the phase—even if they could still complete jobs or play allies.
- Play continues until all players have exhausted their figures.

#### 3. Turf War
- For each Turf (1 through 7), determine influence:
  - Each figure (Family Member, Thug, or neutral) in the Turf or in an adjacent Family Member space contributes 1 Influence.
  - Neutral figures (Mayor, Union Boss, Police Chief) count as a neutral faction (1 Influence each).
- The player with the most Influence gains control by placing a control marker in the Turf’s Control Space.
  - If tied (including ties involving the neutral faction), **no** control marker is placed.
  - Place new markers **on top** of existing ones.
- If a player runs out of control markers, they may move one from another Turf.
- Only the **topmost** control marker determines current control (for benefits). Lower markers count only for endgame scoring.

#### 4. Bribery
- Players secretly bid Money cards **from their Suitcase** into the lid.
- Bids are revealed simultaneously.
- Highest bidder chooses first from face-up Ally cards, then next highest, etc.
- **Ties** are broken by turn order (starting from Horse Head).
- Losing bids remain in the bidder’s Suitcase; winning bids go back to supply.
- Players who bid 0 may not take an Ally.
- **No Bribery Phase in Act IV.**

#### 5. Tribute to the Don
- Players take back all played Ally cards into their hand.
- Discard down to the hand limit for the current Act (shown on Act Track).
  - Ally cards discarded are **removed from the game**.
  - Job cards go to discard pile.
  - Money and other cards return to supply.
- In **Act IV**, after discarding to 2 cards, players place any $ cards among those two into their Suitcase. Other cards are discarded.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Actions
**Play a Thug**  
- Place on an unoccupied square (Thug) space of a Business.
- Use all abilities on the **Front (bottom)** of that Business.
- If the Turf is controlled by **another player**, that player also uses the ability.
- Active player decides who resolves first.
- You do **not** receive the ability if you control the Turf.

**Play a Family Member**  
- Place on an unoccupied round (Family Member) space between Turfs.
- Use all abilities on the **Back (top)** of **all Businesses in adjacent Turfs**.
- Resolve in any order.
- Controlling players of affected Turfs **do not** get the ability.
- Central Park is special: not a controllable Turf; its Back ability (suitcase) can be used when adjacent.

**Complete a Job**  
- Discard required Illegal Goods from hand (Narcotics are wild).
- Take benefits (action and/or $) into hand.
- Place completed Job card into your Suitcase.
- If completing a **public** Job, it is **not replaced** until next Act.
- If a Job allows “gun down,” remove a figure and place it **face-down in the Hudson River**. It returns in the next Act’s Entr’acte.
- If a Job allows a “shake down,” the Turf controller also gets the ability.

**Play an Ally**  
- Play one Ally card per Act (returned to hand at Tribute).
- Use the Ally’s ability.
- Neutral figures:
  - Mayor → placed in Family Member space
  - Union Boss → placed in Thug space
  - Police Chief → placed in Turf area (not in a space)
- Multiple players may have different Ally cards active simultaneously.

#### Key Rules
- **No Change Rule**: Players cannot exchange cards between hand, suitcase, and supply except during endgame scoring.
- **Card Availability**:
  - If an Illegal Goods pile is depleted, no cards of that type can be taken.
  - If a Money denomination is depleted, take the **next lower available** denomination.
  - If Job deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form a new deck (if possible).
- **Figures**: Refers to Thugs and Family Members.
- **Hand Limit**: Enforced at end of each Act during Tribute.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
At the end of Act IV:
- During Tribute, players keep only **2 cards** in hand.
- Any **Money cards** among those two may be placed into the Suitcase.
- All other cards in hand are discarded.
- Open Suitcases and separate contents:
  - Money cards
  - Job cards (by color)

#### Endgame Bonuses
- **Turf Dominance Bonus**: $5 for each Turf where you have the **most total Control markers**.
  - Tie: player with marker **highest in the stack** wins.
- **Jobs Bonus**: $5 for each color of Job (yellow, blue, green, gray) where you have the **most cards**.
  - Tie: **all tied players** receive $5.

**Winning**: Player with the most total money wins.  
**Tiebreaker**: Most Turf Dominance Bonuses.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **"Take" or "Gain"**: Both mean take into your **hand**, not suitcase.
- **Cannot take proper money denomination**: Take same number of **next lower denomination** available.
- **First Player marker changes**: New holder does **not** take an immediate turn. They win bribery ties from that point.
- **No empty space for figure**: If you have a figure to place but no legal space, you **pass and are out of the round**.
- **Shakedowns with multiple abilities**: Resolved individually; active player chooses order.
- **Move figure back to same space**: Allowed.
- **Play Thug without shakedown**: You may place a Thug just to block, even if you can’t fulfill the shakedown. The Turf controller still gets the ability.
- **Complete a Job without fulfilling all actions**: **All job actions must be carried out if possible**.
- **Gun down Neutral figures**: **No**. Only player-owned figures can be gunned down.
- **Same Ally held by multiple players**: Each may use it on their turn.
- **Ally abilities not listed**: Ally only does what is printed. E.g., Act 2 Mayor does **not** perform a shakedown unless specified.
- **Small Time Bookie**: Transfer money **directly from supply to suitcase**.
- **Police Evidence Manager**: Can gain only the goods pictured (not Narcotics).
- **No control markers left**: Can take one from **any Turf**, not just from a stack where you have majority.
- **Endgame bonuses and card availability**: Bonuses are paid **regardless** of available money cards.
