## DICE FORGE: HERO AID — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are a mortal hero competing in a divine tournament orchestrated by the Gods to determine who is worthy of ascension to godhood. The tournament takes place across celestial Islands, each shaped by a different deity. Your goal is to earn the most Glory Points (VP) by upgrading your dice, completing Heroic Feats, and gathering divine blessings. The player with the highest Glory Points at the end of the game wins and earns a seat among the Gods.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of one turn per player, in clockwise order, starting with the First Player. Each turn has four steps:

#### Step 1: All Players Receive Divine Blessings  
- All players **roll both dice**, place them on their Inventory, and **apply effects in any order**.
- Effects typically grant resources (Gold, Sun/Moon Shards).
- In **2-player games**, this step occurs **twice** per turn.
- If multiple players trigger effects simultaneously (e.g., copying), resolve in turn order (active player first).

#### Step 2: Active Player May Activate Reinforcements  
- The active player may activate any card with a **reinforcement effect** (e.g., cog symbol), in any order.
- Each effect may be used **once per turn**.

#### Step 3: Active Player Performs One Action  
The active player chooses **one** of the following:

**A. Make an Offering to the Gods**  
- Spend Gold to take **one or more different** die faces from the Sanctuary.
- Immediately **forge** each face onto one of your dice:
  1. Remove an existing die face.
  2. Attach the new face.
  3. Place the removed face near your Inventory (cannot be reattached).
- You may not acquire the same die face twice in one turn.

**B. Perform a Heroic Feat**  
1. Pay the required **Sun and/or Moon Shards** shown next to the card.
2. Move your **Hero Pawn** to the portal of the Island with the feat (if not already there).
3. If the portal is occupied, **oust** the other player:
   - They return their pawn to their starting portal.
   - They immediately receive a **Divine Blessing** (roll both dice, apply effects).
4. Take the top card from the stack.
5. Apply its effect (if any).
6. Place the card face down in one of three piles:
   - **Pile 1**: No permanent effect (only VP)
   - **Pile 2**: Conditional permanent effect (e.g., triggered by events)
   - **Pile 3**: Active during Step 2 when you are the active player

> You may perform the same feat multiple times (if card stack remains).

#### Step 4: Active Player May Perform an Extra Action  
- Spend **2 Sun Shards** to take **one additional action** (A or B).
- This may be done **only once per turn**.

> End of turn: Next player becomes active.

#### End of Round  
- When all players have taken a turn, advance the **Round Tracker**.
- Game ends after:
  - **9 rounds** (2 or 4 players)
  - **10 rounds** (3 players)

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Divine Blessing  
- Roll both dice, apply effects in any order.
- Occurs:
  - At the start of every player’s turn (Step 1)
  - When a player is ousted
  - Via card effects

#### Minor Blessing  
- Roll **one** die, apply its effect.
- Only occurs via card effects (e.g., Silver Hind).

#### Forging Die Faces  
- Only way to upgrade dice.
- Must remove an existing face to attach a new one.
- Removed faces are discarded permanently.

#### Heroic Feat Cards with Permanent Effects  
Examples from Hero Aid:
- **Blacksmith’s Hammer**:
  - Attach card to Inventory.
  - Take a Hammer token, place on "I" side at start of track.
  - When gaining Gold, may spend **some or all** to advance Hammer token.
  - Reaching end: Gain 10 VP → flip token to "II" side, reset.
  - Reach end again: Gain 15 VP → discard card, set token aside.
  - May hold multiple Hammers: stack under current; when one track ends, start next.
- **Blacksmith’s Chest**:
  - Attach tile to Inventory → increases reserve limits (e.g., Gold to 18).
- **Great Bear**:
  - Gain 3 VP whenever you oust another hero or are ousted.
- **Tenacious Boar**:
  - Take card from Temple Gardens.
  - Choose another player as **face bearer**.
  - Bearer must forge the matching die face onto one die (cannot remove it later).
  - Whenever that face is rolled, card owner gains 1 VP, 1 Sun, 1 Moon, or 3 Gold.
  - Effect not blocked by Minotaur.
- **Satyrs**:
  - All other players roll dice, apply no effects.
  - You choose **2** of their rolled faces and apply those effects as your own.
- **Minotaur**:
  - All other players roll dice, but:
    - Resource-giving faces cause loss instead.
    - Celestial Ship faces do nothing.
  - Losses beyond 0 are ignored.
  - Players may choose which resource to lose if multiple options.
- **Celestial Ship**:
  - Take one die face from Temple Gardens and forge it immediately.
- **Guardian’s Owl**:
  - Gain 1 VP or 1 Gold.
- **Guardian’s Shield**:
  - Four variants (one per resource).
  - When paired with another die face:
    - If you gain the matching resource → gain **2 extra** (Reward A)
    - If you gain a different resource → gain the resource shown (Reward B)
  - Choice must be made before applying reward.

#### Special Die Faces  
- **×3 Face**:
  - Multiply the other die’s result by 3.
  - If choice involved, choose first, then multiply.
- **Copy Face**:
  - Copy one face from an opponent’s die.
  - With **3** on die: choose which die to copy, then multiply by 3.

#### Linked Effects  
- Some die faces allow forging from Sanctuary at a discount (e.g., –2 Gold).
- If multiple players trigger during Step 1, resolve in turn order.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

    - Tokens (e.g., overflow)
- **Highest total wins**.

> Resources beyond max track (e.g., Gold >12) are lost.
> Glory Points: Upon reaching 100, take a token, reset marker to 0.
