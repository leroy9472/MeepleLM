## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Doppelt So Clever is a strategic dice-rolling game by Wolfgang Warsch for 1–4 players. Players take turns being the Active Player, rolling six dice and selecting one die per roll to score on their personal score sheet. Unused lower-valued dice are placed on the Silver Platter for Passive Players to use. The goal is to maximize your total score across five colored sections, using actions and bonuses wisely. The player with the highest score wins; ties are broken by the highest single-section score.

2. Components  
- 1 Score sheet per player  
- 6 dice (white, yellow, blue, green, pink, silver)  
- 4 felt-tip pens (one per player)  
- Game box with printed Silver Platter area  

3. Setup  
- Each player takes a score sheet and pen.  
- Choose a starting player, who takes all 6 dice.  
- The game lasts:  
  - 4 rounds (4 players)  
  - 5 rounds (3 players)  
  - 6 rounds (1–2 players)  
- At the start of each of the first three rounds, each player gains one bonus action (Reroll, Die Back, or Extra Die).  
- At the start of round 4, each player chooses one wild bonus (black ?).

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds. In each round:  
1. One player is the Active Player; others are Passive Players.  
2. The Active Player rolls all 6 dice and performs up to 3 actions:  
   a. Choose one die to use.  
   b. Mark the corresponding space on their score sheet.  
   c. Move all dice with values lower than the chosen die to the Silver Platter.  
   d. Roll remaining dice again (if any).  
   e. Repeat for up to 3 selections.  
   f. After the third selection (or if no dice remain), place all unused dice on the Silver Platter.  
3. After the Active Player finishes, all Passive Players simultaneously:  
   a. Choose one die from the Silver Platter.  
   b. Use it on their own score sheet.  
   c. Multiple players may use the same die.  
   d. If a Passive Player cannot use any die from the Silver Platter, they may use one die from the Active Player’s score sheet.  
4. The next player clockwise becomes the Active Player.  
5. After all players have been Active once, the round ends.  
6. Players may use Extra Die actions at the end of the round.

5. Core Mechanics  

### White Die (Wild)  
- Can be used as any color (silver, yellow, green, pink).  
- When used with blue die: sum blue + white for blue area (even if one die is on Silver Platter or already used).  

### Silver Area  
- Cross out one field matching the value of the silver (or white-as-silver) die.  
- Additionally, cross out fields matching the color and value of any dice moved to the Silver Platter *after* selecting the silver die.  
- Cannot use silver die if the matching number is already marked.  
- Passive players using silver die only mark one field (no extra marks from platter).  
- Scoring: Points based on number of marks per row (see gray stars at bottom).  

### Yellow Area  
- First occurrence: circle a number matching the yellow (or white-as-yellow) die.  
- Second occurrence: cross out the same number.  
- Bonuses are triggered when a full row or column is *circled* (not crossed).  
- Scoring: Based on number of *crossed* fields (see yellow stars at top).  

### Blue Area  
- Use sum of blue and white die (in any order).  
- Fill from left to right, no skipping.  
- Each number must be ≤ the previous number.  
- Scoring: Points equal to the number in the white star above the last filled box.  

### Green Area  
- Fill from left to right, no skipping.  
- Multiply die value by the multiplier in the current box.  
- After two boxes are filled, compute: (left value) – (right value); write result in green star above.  
- Negative results are allowed.  
- If only one box in a pair is filled at game end, score 0 for that pair.  
- Scoring: Sum of all values in green stars.  

### Pink Area  
- Fill from left to right, no skipping.  
- Write die value in current box.  
- Bonus is earned only if die value ≥ minimum shown in the box.  
- No restrictions on value entered.  
- Scoring: Sum of all entered numbers.  

### Actions  
Earned by completing action tracks or at start of rounds. Circle to earn, cross out to use.  

- **Reroll (Active Only):** Reroll all dice just rolled (not on sheet or platter). Cannot keep any.  
- **Die Back (Active Only):** Retrieve one die from Silver Platter before a roll. Cannot use before a Reroll.  
- **Extra Die:** Use any die again at end of round (after all Active/Passive actions). Can use multiple times per round, but each die only once via this action.  

### Bonuses  
- Triggered by:  
  - Completing a row/column in silver (all marked) or yellow (all *circled*)  
  - Filling a space with a bonus symbol (? or number)  
  - Completing an action track (last circle)  
- Must be used immediately.  
- Types:  
  - **? Bonus:** Immediately mark any available space in any color area (1–6 for green/pink, 2–12 for blue, mark/circle for silver/yellow). Yellow: only cross if already circled.  
  - **Number Bonus:** Write that number in next available space in green or pink area.  
  - **X Bonus:** Mark any available field in yellow, blue, or green area.  
- Black ? (Round 4): Wild bonus—choose any color when using.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after the last Passive Player completes their action in the final round.  
- Players may use Extra Die actions, but unused Reroll actions expire.  
- Score each section:  
  - Silver: Sum row points (from gray stars)  
  - Yellow: Points from number of crossed fields (yellow stars)  
  - Blue: Points from star above last filled box  
  - Green: Sum of all green stars (pair differences)  
  - Pink: Sum of all entered numbers  
- Fox Bonus: Each fox = value of your lowest-scoring section  
- Total Score = Sum of all five sections + Fox Bonus  
- Winner: Highest total. Tiebreaker: highest score in a single section. If still tied, share victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip a space in left-to-right areas?** No. Must fill from left to right, no skipping.  
- **Can I use a die I can’t apply?** Active Player: Yes, but must still place lower dice on platter. Passive Player: Must use a die if possible; if none usable, may use Active Player’s sheet die.  
- **Can multiple Passive Players use the same platter die?** Yes.  
- **Can I use Reroll after using Die Back?** Yes, as long as it’s before the next roll.  
- **Can I use Extra Die on a die already used this turn?** Yes, but only once per die per round via Extra Die.  
- **Does Silver Area bonus apply when Passive?** No. Only dice moved *after* silver selection count. Passive use gives only one mark.  
- **Can I use a bonus to fill a space I can’t legally fill?** No. Must follow section rules (e.g., blue must be ≤ previous).  
- **What if I can’t use a bonus immediately?** You must still use it if possible. If no legal use, forfeit it.
