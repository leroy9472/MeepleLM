## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Gizmos is a card-based strategy game where players take on the role of inventors building increasingly complex machines (Gizmos) to earn victory points. The goal is to out-invent your opponents by constructing powerful combinations of Gizmos that generate energy, accelerate research, and maximize scoring.

The game ends when one player builds their 16th Gizmo or their 4th Level 3 Gizmo. After all players have had an equal number of turns, the player with the most victory points wins.

### 2. Components  
Each player receives:  
- 1 Dashboard (includes action sections and storage limits)  
- 1 Energy Ring (to hold marbles)  
- 1 Starting Gizmos card (placed under the "File" section at start)  

Game-wide components:  
- 3 shuffled decks of Gizmo cards: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3  
- 4 Level 1 cards, 3 Level 2 cards, and 2 Level 3 cards placed face-up in the Display  
- Energy Dispenser (holds marbles; 6 marbles in the Energy Row at start)  
- 60 marbles (in multiple colors) placed in the top of the Energy Dispenser  

Note: Remove 20 cards from the Level 3 deck before setup.

### 3. Setup  
1. Give each player:  
   - A Dashboard (use the darker "1st player" board to determine starting player)  
   - An Energy Ring  
   - The Starting Gizmos card (place under the "File" section of the Dashboard)  

2. Shuffle each of the Level 1, 2, and 3 Gizmo decks separately.  
3. Create the Display:  
   - Reveal 4 Level 1 cards face-up in a row  
   - Reveal 3 Level 2 cards face-up  
   - Reveal 2 Level 3 cards face-up  
4. Assemble the Energy Dispenser and place all marbles in the top. 6 marbles will roll into the Energy Row.  
5. Remove 20 cards from the Level 3 deck and return them to the box.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order, starting with the first player. On your turn, perform exactly one of the following four actions:

#### Actions:
1. **File (Folder Icon)**  
   - Take 1 face-up Gizmo card from the Display and place it face-up in your Archive.  
   - Replace the vacated spot with the top card from the corresponding Level deck.  
   - You cannot File if your Archive is at capacity (starts at 1; can increase via effects).

2. **Pick (Hand Icon)**  
   - Take 1 marble from the Energy Row and place it in your Energy Ring.  
   - You cannot Pick if your Energy Ring is full (starts at 5; can increase via effects).  
   - Marbles taken must be from the visible Energy Row.

3. **Build (Wrench Icon)**  
   - Choose 1 Gizmo card:  
     - From your Archive, or  
     - Directly from the 9-card Display (Level 1–3)  
   - Pay the required energy (marbles) shown in the bottom-left of the card. Return paid marbles to the top of the Energy Dispenser.  
   - Place the built card under the matching section on your Dashboard (based on top-left icon).  
   - The card becomes active immediately.

4. **Research (Magnifying Glass Icon)**  
   - Based on your current Research capacity (starts at 3; can increase), draw that many cards from the top of one Level deck (Level 1, 2, or 3).  
   - Look at all drawn cards. Choose one option:  
     a) Return all cards to the bottom of the deck in any order. Take no further action.  
     b) Choose one card to File (add to Archive), return the rest to the bottom of the deck in any order.  
     c) Choose one card to Build (pay its cost), return the rest to the bottom of the deck in any order.  
   - If you File or Build during Research, the corresponding Gizmo effects **are triggered**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Dashboard Anatomy  
- **Storage Limits (left section):** Shows starting limits for:  
  - Energy Ring (marble storage): 5  
  - Archive (filed cards): 1  
  - Research capacity: 3  
  These can be increased by card effects.

- **Converter Section:** Explains how certain Gizmos convert one energy type to another (see List of Effects).

- **Action Sections (4):** Correspond to the four actions. Built Gizmos are placed under these sections and activate when the corresponding action is taken.

- **Archive:** A virtual area where players store filed Gizmo cards before building.

#### Gizmo Card Anatomy  
- **Top Left:** Action type (Folder, Hand, Wrench, Magnifying Glass) — determines where built card goes on Dashboard  
- **Top Middle:** Card effect (see List of Effects)  
- **Top Right:** Victory Points (VP) awarded at game end  
- **Bottom Left:** Energy cost (colored marbles required to build)

#### Triggering Gizmo Effects  
After performing an action:  
- Activate **all built Gizmos** under that action’s section on your Dashboard.  
- You may trigger each Gizmo **only once per turn**.  
- Order of activation is chosen by the player.  
- You may choose **not to trigger** any or all of them.  
- A Gizmo built on the same turn **can be used**, but **not triggered by the same action that built it**.

> Example: If you Build a Gizmo using the Build action, you cannot use its Build effect that same turn.

#### Capacity Limits  
- If you exceed a capacity (Energy Ring, Archive, Research), excess is **lost**.  
- You **cannot swap out** cards or marbles.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when **any player** meets **one** of these conditions:  
- Has built their **16th Gizmo**, or  
- Has built their **4th Level 3 Gizmo**

Then:  
- Continue play until all players have had an equal number of turns (i.e., finish the round).  
- All players reveal their built Gizmos and score:  
  - Sum of VP values on built Gizmo cards  
  - Add any VP tokens earned during the game (if applicable)  

**Winning:**  
- Highest total VP wins.  
- Tiebreakers in order:  
  1. Most Gizmos built  
  2. Most leftover marbles in Energy Ring  
  3. Furthest from first player (i.e., last player wins)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I trigger a Gizmo I just built?**  
  Yes, but not from the same action that built it.  
  Example: A Build-action Gizmo built via Build cannot trigger that turn. But if built via Research, it can trigger on a later Build action.

- **What if the Display has empty spots?**  
  Refill immediately after taking a card, if the deck has cards. If a deck runs out, leave the spot empty.

- **Can I choose not to use a Gizmo effect?**  
  Yes. You may skip any or all effects during triggering.

- **Do I have to return cards in a specific order during Research?**  
  No. You may reorder the returned cards in any way when placing them back on the bottom of the deck.

- **What happens if I can’t File during Research due to Archive limit?**  
  You may still choose option (a) or (c). Option (b) is only available if you can File the card.

- **Can I Build a card directly from the Display during Research?**  
  Yes, as long as you pay the cost. This uses option (c).
