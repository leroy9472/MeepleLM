## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Furnace*, players take on the roles of 19th-century industrialists building industrial empires by acquiring company cards, extracting and processing resources, and upgrading operations. The goal is to amass the most money over four rounds. Victory is determined by total wealth, with tiebreakers based on number of cards and then resources.

### 2. Components  
- 36 double-sided Company cards  
- 5 single-sided Start-up cards  
- 4 sets of 4 colored Capital discs (values 1–4)  
- 1 neutral "2" Capital disc  
- 4 Player Color tokens  
- 4 Capitalist cards  
- 1 First Player token  
- Round counter (2 pieces)  
- 40 Coal cubes, 20 Iron bars, 15 Oil drums  
- 4 Multiplication tokens (×3, ×5)  
- 12 Upgrade tokens  
- 61 Money tokens  
- 1 six-sided die (used in 2-player and solo variants)  

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player:  
   - Chooses a color and takes matching Capital discs and Player token.  
   - Draws a random Start-up card and gains the starting resources shown.  
   - Draws a random Capitalist card and takes the neutral "2" disc if applicable.  
2. Place the Round counter at "1".  
3. Shuffle the Company deck and place it on the Round counter, upgraded side up.  
4. Randomly determine the first player and give them the First Player token.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 4 rounds. Each round consists of two phases:

#### Auction Phase  
1. **Deal Market Row**:  
   - 2 players: 6 cards  
   - 3 players: 7 cards  
   - 4 players: 8 cards  
   Cards are dealt basic side up. The top card is randomly reinserted into the deck before dealing.  
2. **Bidding**:  
   - Players take turns placing one Capital disc on any card, clockwise from the first player.  
   - Restrictions:  
     - Only one disc per player per card.  
     - No duplicate disc values on a single card.  
   - Bidding continues until all players have placed all 4 discs (or 5 if they have the neutral "2").  
3. **Resolve Auction (Left to Right)**:  
   - For each card:  
     - If no disc is present, discard the card.  
     - If discs are present:  
       - Highest bid wins the card (placed basic side up in front of the winner).  
       - All other bidders are compensated based on the card’s compensation effect, multiplied by their disc value.  
       - Winner does **not** receive compensation.  
   - Players retrieve all discs.  

#### Production Phase  
All players resolve simultaneously:  
1. **Order**: Players may arrange their cards in any order (unless playing with Production Chain variant).  
2. **Resolving Cards**:  
   - Each card may be activated once per phase.  
   - Basic side up: Only basic effect may be used.  
   - Upgraded side up: Both basic and additional effects may be used, resolved top to bottom.  
   - No effect may be inserted between a card’s effects.  
3. **Start-up Card Effects**:  
   - Gain 1 Upgrade token.  
   - Upgrade any number of owned Company cards (cost: 1 Coal + 1 Upgrade token each).  
   - Cannot upgrade Start-up card.  
   - Upgrades must be done **before** activating a card’s effects to use the additional effect in the same round.  
4. **Resource Management**:  
   - Extraction: Mandatory. Gain resources as shown.  
   - Processing: Optional. Discard left-side resources to gain right-side ones, up to the number of times shown × disc value (if compensated) or player choice (if owner).  
5. **End of Phase**:  
   - Pass First Player token to the left.  
   - Advance Round counter.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Extraction**: Mandatory gain of resources. Multiplied by disc value during compensation.  
- **Processing**: Optional conversion. Limited by arrow number × disc value (for compensation) or player choice (for owners).  
- **Upgrading**: Flip a Company card to its upgraded side. Costs 1 Coal + 1 Upgrade token. Enables additional effects.  
- **Capitalist Cards**: Grant unique abilities (e.g., extra disc, disc value +1, re-resolve a card).  
- **Production Chain Variant**: Cards must be in a fixed left-to-right chain. Resolved in order. New cards inserted without changing existing order.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
At the end of Round 4:  
1. Each player totals their **money**.  
2. **Winner**: Most money.  
3. **Tiebreakers**:  
   - Most cards.  
   - Most resources.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Multiple discs from one player (e.g., Varvara Morozova)**: Each disc resolved individually. Non-winning bids get compensation. If highest bid is tied in value, the bidder does **not** win the card and is compensated; the other player with the same value wins.  
- **Annie Malone (re-resolve a card)**: Can re-resolve any card, even out of order. If card was upgraded after first use, both effects are available.  
- **Nikolay Vtorov (extra "2" disc)**: Must place all 5 discs. If unable to place the last disc, auction ends for that player.  
- **Resource shortages**: Use Multiplication tokens or substitutes. Supply is unlimited.  
- **Upgrading mid-phase**: Can upgrade a card during Production Phase, but must do so **before** resolving its effects to use the additional effect in that round.
