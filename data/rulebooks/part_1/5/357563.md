## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
At the heart of the Mediterranean, rival cities seek wealth and glory. As one of the most talented architects of ancient Greece, your goal is to build a thriving city by strategically placing districts, plazas, and quarries. You must manage stone resources wisely, construct harmonious districts that meet specific placement conditions, and maximize your victory points through effective use of plazas and elevation. In Solo mode, you compete against a virtual opponent—the Illustrious Architect—at one of three difficulty levels: Hippodamos (Easy), Metagenes (Medium), or Callicrates (Hard). You win by scoring more points than the Illustrious Architect; in case of a tie, the player with more Stones wins.

2. Components  
- 61 City tiles (each with 3 construction hexes: Districts, Plazas, or Quarries)  
- 4 Starting tiles (1 per player)  
- 40 Stone cubes  
- 1 Chief Architect marker  
- 1 scorepad  
- 4 Player aids (showing construction hex distribution per player count)  

3. Setup  
- Select City tiles based on player count:  
  - 2 players: tiles marked “2+”  
  - 3 players: tiles marked “2+” and “3+”  
  - 4 players: tiles marked “2+”, “3+”, and “4”  
- Create 11 face-down stacks:  
  - 2 players: 3 tiles per stack  
  - 3 players: 4 tiles per stack  
  - 4 players: 5 tiles per stack  
  Optional: For longer games with 2 or 3 players, use all tiles to create 19 stacks (2 players) or 15 stacks (3 players).  
- Place remaining tiles face up in a line in the center—this is the **Construction Site**. At the start of each round, it must contain 2 more tiles than the number of players.  
- Each player (Architect) takes:  
  - 1 starting tile (placed in front of them)  
  - Starting Stones:  
    - 1st player: 1 Stone  
    - 2nd player: 2 Stones  
    - 3rd player: 3 Stones  
    - 4th player: 4 Stones  
- The Chief Architect marker goes to the player who most recently climbed a hill.  
- Remaining Stones are placed in the common reserve.  

For Solo Mode (vs. Illustrious Architect):  
- Set up as a 2-player game.  
- You are the 1st player.  
- You receive: 1 starting tile, 1 Stone, and the Chief Architect marker.  
- The Illustrious Architect receives: 1 starting tile and 2 Stones.  
- It is recommended to separate the Illustrious Architect’s area from yours.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds in clockwise order, beginning with the Chief Architect. Each turn consists of two actions:  
1. Take a tile from the Construction Site  
2. Add it to your city  

The game progresses in rounds. When only one tile remains in the Construction Site:  
- Move that tile to the front of the line.  
- Replenish the Construction Site by revealing one stack of tiles (placed face up, left to right).  
- Pass the Chief Architect marker to the left.  
- Play continues with the new Chief Architect.  

The game ends when only one tile remains and no stacks are left to replenish the Construction Site. The last tile is not played.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Taking a Tile**  
- Choose any tile from the Construction Site.  
- Pay 1 Stone for each tile preceding it (e.g., taking the 4th tile costs 3 Stones).  
- If you cannot pay, you must take the first tile (no cost).  
- Spent Stones return to the reserve—**except in Solo mode, where your spent Stones go to the Illustrious Architect**.  

**Adding a Tile to Your City**  
- A tile may be placed on the 1st level or higher.  
- **1st level**: Must share at least one edge with an existing tile.  
- **Higher level**: Must cover exactly 3 hexes across at least 2 different tiles (cannot float over empty space).  
- A tile consists of 3 hexes: Quarries, Plazas, or Districts (Housing, Market, Barracks, Temple, Garden).  
- Covered hexes are no longer active.  

**Quarries**  
- No points, but when covered by a tile, gain 1 Stone from the reserve.  

**Plazas**  
- Multiply points of matching Districts at game end. Stars on Plazas are cumulative.  
- A matching Plaza (same color/type) must exist in your city for a District to score.  
- Plazas on higher levels do not score extra.  
- Starting tile includes a Housing Plaza (blue).  

**Districts**  
To score points, a District must:  
1. Meet its placement condition.  
2. Have at least one matching Plaza in your city.  

Placement Conditions:  
- **Housing (Blue)**: Only the largest contiguous group scores.  
- **Market (Yellow)**: Cannot be adjacent to another Market.  
- **Barracks (Red)**: Must be on the edge of your city.  
- **Temple (Purple)**: Must be completely surrounded (6 adjacent tiles).  
- **Gardens (Green)**: No placement condition.  

**District Value**  
- Based on level: 1 point per level (1st level = 1, 2nd = 2, etc.).  
- Value is used in scoring calculation.  

**Solo Mode – Illustrious Architect’s Turn**  
- After your turn, simulate the Illustrious Architect:  
  - Always tries to acquire the **cheapest City tile with a Plaza**.  
  - If unable (no such tile or insufficient Stones), takes the **first tile** in the Construction Site.  
  - Spent Stones return to the common reserve.  
- Place the acquired tile in their area—**no placement rules apply during play**.  
- At game end, all their Districts are considered to automatically satisfy placement conditions.  
- You may inspect their collected tiles at any time.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when only one tile remains in the Construction Site and no stacks are left.  

**Scoring (All Players)**  
For each District type:  
1. Sum the **Values** of all qualifying Districts (those meeting placement conditions).  
2. Sum the **Stars** from matching Plazas.  
3. Multiply: (Total Value) × (Total Stars) = Points for that District type.  

Additionally:  
- Gain **1 Victory Point per Stone** in your supply.  

**Illustrious Architect Scoring (Solo Mode)**  
Scored based on difficulty level:  
- **Hippodamos (Easy)**: All Districts treated as 1st level (value = 1 each).  
- **Metagenes (Medium)**: All Districts treated as 1st level. Gain **+2 points per Quarry** owned.  
- **Callicrates (Hard)**: All Districts treated as **2nd level** (value = 2 each).  

**Win Condition**  
- You win if you score **more points** than the Illustrious Architect.  
- In case of a tie, the player with more Stones wins.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What happens to Stones I spend?**  
  In Solo mode, they go to the Illustrious Architect. In multiplayer, they return to the reserve.  
- **Can I take a tile I can’t place?**  
  No—every tile taken must be placed according to placement rules.  
- **Do Plazas on higher levels give more points?**  
  No—only Districts gain value from elevation.  
- **Can the Illustrious Architect run out of Stones?**  
  No—they only spend from the reserve, and you give them your spent Stones.  
- **Are the Illustrious Architect’s tiles scored normally?**  
  No—placement conditions are waived at scoring; only their District count, Plaza stars, and difficulty rules matter.  
- **Can I use variants in Solo mode?**  
  Yes—the solo rules do not prohibit using the optional variants (e.g., doubling points for extra conditions).
