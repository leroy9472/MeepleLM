### 1. Lore & Objective
BattleLore Second Edition is a two-player fantasy wargame where each player commands an army on opposing sides of a modular battlefield. The objective is to either accumulate 16 or more Victory Points (VPs) while having more VPs than the opponent at the start of a turn, or to eliminate all of the opponent's units.

### 2. Components
- Game board with hex grid
- Plastic unit figures (Daqan Lords in blue, Uthuk Y'llan in red)
- Unit reference cards
- Deployment cards (unit, terrain, decoy)
- Command cards
- Lore cards (faction-specific and neutral)
- Terrain tiles (clear, hill, forest, water, building, rubble, cavern, hoard, plaguelands, blood field, crystal spire, graveyard, barricade)
- Tokens and markers (VP, lore, banner, ford, bridge, neutral, effect markers: blight, bleed, panic, stun, poison, shield, inferno)

### 3. Setup
1. **Board & Factions**: Place the board centrally. Players choose or randomly determine factions (Daqan or Uthuk).
2. **Scenario Selection**: Each player shuffles their scenario deck, draws 3 cards, chooses 1, and reveals it simultaneously.
3. **First Player**: Determined by alphabetical order of scenario card name (then lowest number if tied).
4. **Terrain Placement**: Follow scenario card instructions to place terrain tiles, banner markers, and ford tokens (starting with first player).
5. **Army Muster**:
   - Each player has 50 muster points (55 if including a command tent).
   - Build an army of exactly 18 deployment cards (units, terrain, decoys).
   - Optional: Draft neutral units in alternating turns (first player takes 1, opponent up to 2, then alternate 1 each until both pass).
6. **Deploy Cards**: Place 18 deployment cards face-down on colored deployment hexes. Terrain cards must go on non-terrain hexes.
7. **Reveal & Deploy Units**: Flip cards face-up. Remove decoys. Gain 1 lore token per unspent muster point (max 5). Replace cards with units and terrain.
8. **Special Terrain Deployment**:
   - **Caverns**: For each Razorwings unit, replace one hill tile on player's half with a cavern tile.
   - **Hoard**: For each Great Dragon unit on a clear hex (not center row), place a hoard tile.
   - **Plaguelands/Blood Field/Graveyard/Crystal Spire/Barricade**: Place on clear hexes as mustered.
9. **Lore Deck Customization (Optional)**: Replace up to 5 cards in lore deck with available faction or neutral lore cards (max 2 copies per name).
10. **Draw Hands**: Draw 6 command cards and 3 lore cards. Secretly return 2 command cards and 1 lore card to the bottom of their decks. Final hand: 4 command cards, 2 lore cards.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn has two phases:

**I. Main Phase**
- **Command Step**: Play one command card. Either resolve its text or order one friendly unit anywhere.
- **Order Step**: Declare ordered units. Ordered units must be in sections specified by the command card (left, center, right). Each unit can be ordered once per turn.
- **Move Step**: Move each ordered unit up to its movement value. Movement ends immediately when entering forest, building, ford, rubble, hoard, cavern, or barricade hexes. Units cannot occupy the same hex.
- **Attack Step**: Each ordered unit may perform one attack (melee or ranged). Declare target, roll combat dice, resolve results (strike, cleave, pierce, morale, lore, heroic), suffer damage, resolve retreats, gain lore, allow counter, and advance if applicable.

**II. Upkeep Phase**
- **Victory Point Step**: Gain VPs for friendly units occupying banner markers (per scenario) and any other VP conditions.
- **Draw Step**: Draw one command card.
- **Lore Step**: Choose one:
  - Gain 2 lore tokens.
  - Gain 1 lore token and draw 1 lore card.
  - Draw 2 lore cards, then discard 1.
  - Hand limit: 4 lore cards.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Combat**:
  - **Melee Attack**: Target adjacent unit. Roll dice equal to combat value.
  - **Ranged Attack**: Target within range and line of sight (LOS). LOS is blocked by units (except from hills) and blocking terrain (forest, building, hill, rubble, barricade, etc.).
  - **Dice Results**:
    - **Strike (⚔️)**: 1 damage in melee.
    - **Cleave (🗡️)**: 1 damage in melee if attacker is not weak.
    - **Pierce (🎯)**: 1 damage in ranged.
    - **Morale (⚑)**: Target retreats 1 hex directly away.
    - **Lore (♦)**: Gain 1 lore token per result not committed.
    - **Heroic (👑)**: Triggers unit abilities.
  - **Weak Units**: Units reduced to 1 figure (except legend units) cannot cause damage from ⚔️ or 🗡️.
  - **Counter**: If target survives and remains adjacent, it may counter (cannot trigger another counter).
  - **Advance**: Move into target's original hex if it was eliminated or retreated.
- **Movement & Terrain**:
  - **Forest/Building/Ford/Hoard/Cavern/Rubble**: Movement ends immediately upon entry.
  - **Barricade**: End movement or suffer 1 damage to continue.
  - **Water**: Impassable unless ford or bridge present.
  - **Flying**: Can move through impassable terrain and unit-occupied hexes (cannot end there). Ignores terrain combat effects.
- **Retreats**: Move directly away. Cannot move into impassable terrain, off-board, or enemy unit → suffer 1 damage per unresolved retreat. Supported (would retreat into friendly unit) → ignore retreat.
- **Lore Cards**: Spend lore tokens equal to cost. Play one per turn. Resolve effect, then discard.
- **Effect Markers**:
  - **Blight**: Movement = 1, unit is weak. Remove by spending 2 lore during Order Step.
  - **Poison**: Each ⚔️ in attack causes 1 damage. Remove by spending 2 lore.
  - **Stun**: Unit cannot move, attack, counter, or retreat. Remove by spending 2 lore.
  - **Bleed**: Roll 1 fewer die (min 1). Remove by spending 2 lore.
  - **Panic**: Each ⚔️ in attack causes self-damage. Remove by spending 2 lore.
  - **Shield**: Ignore 1 damage (marker removed when damage is prevented).
  - **Inferno**: Non-flying unit entering suffers 1 damage and ends movement. Marker removed.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Conditions**:
  1. **Elimination**: Immediately win if all opponent's units are eliminated.
  2. **Victory Points**: At the start of your turn, if you have ≥16 VPs and more than your opponent, you win.
- **VP Sources**:
  - Occupying banner markers (per scenario).
  - **Hoard Hex**: 3 VP if your unit occupies enemy's hoard hex at start of turn.
  - **Command Tent**: 2 VP if your unit occupies enemy's command tent at start of turn.
  - **Scenario Objectives**: e.g., eliminate unit on water (Uthuk A1).
- **Tiebreaker**: If both reach 16+ VPs simultaneously, game continues. Winner of final scenario in a campaign gains bonus VPs.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Advance Multiple Times**: Yes, if multiple conditions are met (e.g., Pursue + normal advance).
- **Flying & Terrain**: Flying units ignore terrain combat effects but can be affected by specific terrain like Caverns or Plaguelands.
- **Unstoppable vs. Cannot Counter**: Abilities that say "cannot counter" (e.g., Riverwatch Riders) override Unstoppable.
- **Shield vs. Building**: Shield must be used before other damage prevention effects (e.g., building's ignore 1 damage).
- **Timing**: If multiple effects trigger at the same time, active player chooses resolution order.
- **Mandatory Abilities**: If an ability uses "do" or "must", it is mandatory unless "may" is specified.
