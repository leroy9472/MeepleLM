### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Ghost Stories*, players take on the roles of Taoist priests (Fat-Si) defending a village from supernatural forces led by Wu-Feng, Lord of the Nine Hells. Wu-Feng’s ashes are buried in the village cemetery, and he seeks to reclaim his funerary urn and return to the world of the living. The Taoists must cooperate to exorcise Wu-Feng’s incarnations and prevent the village from falling into darkness.

**Objective**: The players win collectively by successfully exorcising all incarnations of Wu-Feng present in the game. The game ends in defeat if all Taoists die, three village tiles become haunted (four in Initiation mode), or the last ghost card is drawn before all Wu-Feng incarnations are defeated.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn consists of two phases:

#### Yin Phase (Ghosts)
1. **Ghost Actions**:
   - **Haunter Ability**: For each ghost with this ability, advance its Haunting figurine. If it reaches the edge of the board, haunt the first unhaunted tile in front of the ghost and reset the figurine.
   - **Tormentor Ability**: For each such ghost, roll the Curse die and apply the effect (e.g., haunt a tile, lose Qi, discard Tao tokens, draw a ghost).
2. **Board Overrun?**: If the player’s board has 3 ghosts, they lose 1 Qi and skip drawing a new ghost.
3. **Arrival of a Ghost**: If the board is not full, draw the top ghost card and place it:
   - Colored ghosts (red, green, blue, yellow) go on their matching board if possible.
   - Black ghosts go on the active player’s board if possible.
   - If no space on the target board, place it on any board.
   - Apply the left-stone ability immediately upon placement.
   - If all 12 spaces are occupied, lose 1 Qi instead.

#### Yang Phase (Taoist)
1. **Move (optional)**: Move the Taoist to an adjacent tile (including diagonally).
2. **Action**: Choose one:
   - **Request Help from a Villager**: Use the ability of the tile where the Taoist stands.
   - **Attempt an Exorcism**: Roll the 3 Tao dice to defeat a ghost on an adjacent space. Success requires dice results matching or exceeding the ghost’s resistance (white faces are wild). Tao tokens of the correct color can be spent to meet resistance. Multiple Taoists on the same tile may pool tokens.
     - On a corner tile, a Taoist may attempt to exorcise two adjacent ghosts in one roll.
3. **Place a Buddha (optional)**: If the player has a Buddha figurine, they may place it on an empty ghost space they are facing. Two may be placed from a corner if both spaces are free.
4. **Yin-Yang Use**: The Yin-Yang token may be used before or after any step to either:
   - Request help from any villager without being on that tile.
   - Flip a haunted tile back to active.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Exorcism**: Roll 3 Tao dice. Match or exceed the ghost’s resistance in the ghost’s color (white = wild). Tao tokens of the correct color can cover deficits. If dice alone meet resistance, exorcism is mandatory.
- **Ghost Abilities**:
  - **Left Stone**: Triggered when the ghost is placed.
  - **Middle Stone**: Triggered each Yin phase (Haunter, Tormentor).
  - **Right Stone**: Triggered when exorcised (curses and rewards).
- **Buddha Figurines**: Placed via Buddhist Temple. When a ghost is placed on a space with a Buddha, it is immediately discarded without triggering abilities.
- **Taoist Powers**:
  - **Yellow (Bottomless Pockets)**: Take 1 Tao token of any color before moving.
  - **Red (Dance of the Twin Winds)**: After moving, move another Taoist 1 space.
  - **Blue (Second Wind)**: Attempt two exorcisms or use a village ability twice (independent rolls).
  - **Green (Strength of the Mountain)**: Roll a 4th Tao die during exorcism; immune to Curse die.
- **Yin-Yang**: Can be regained by exorcising certain ghosts. May be used and regained in the same turn.
- **Death of a Taoist**: A Taoist with 0 Qi is dead. All possessions are lost. The board remains active; ghosts continue to act. The player still participates in decisions and may win. Resurrection is possible via the Cemetery tile.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Win Condition**: Exorcise all Wu-Feng incarnations. The game ends immediately after the final exorcism, but any curse from the last incarnation must be resolved without causing defeat.

**Loss Conditions**:
1. All Taoists are dead.
2. Three village tiles are haunted (four in Initiation mode).
3. The last ghost card is drawn and Wu-Feng is not yet defeated.

**Scoring**:
- +10 points for victory (Initiation, Normal, Nightmare)
- +20 points for victory (Hell)
- +1 point per remaining Qi
- +1 point per ghost remaining in deck (if won); -1 per ghost if lost
- -3 points per dead Taoist
- -4 points per haunted village tile
- +2/+4/+6 points for defeating 1st/2nd/3rd Wu-Feng in Nightmare/Hell (3-4 players)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Multiple Ghosts on a Board**: Apply Haunter and Tormentor effects from right to left.
- **Exorcising Two Ghosts**: Dice must meet the combined resistance. Tao tokens can be used. If dice alone can exorcise one or both, exorcism is mandatory for those possible.
- **Neutral Boards (1–3 Players)**:
  - Receive 3 Qi at start.
  - No Yang phase; only Yin phase steps 1 and 2.
  - Cannot draw ghosts (no step 3).
  - If overrun, lose 1 Qi; if at 0 Qi, a player takes the loss.
- **Power Tokens (1–3 Players)**: Allow use of a neutral board’s power during Yang phase. Multiple tokens can be used in one turn for different powers. Tokens are placed on the center tile and collected when a Taoist ends their turn there.
- **Yin-Yang in Same Turn**: Can be used, regained via reward, and used again in the same turn.
- **Buddha Interaction with Incarnations**: Only Uncatchable can be affected by Buddhas. Other incarnations ignore Buddha effects.
- **Nameless Incarnation**: White faces on dice are ignored. Circle of Prayer token is discarded upon arrival.
