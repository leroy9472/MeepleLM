## San Juan – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the new world of San Juan, players compete to become the most prosperous citizen by building a thriving city. You take on various roles—Builder, Producer, Trader, Councillor, or Prospector—to produce goods, trade for cards, and construct buildings. Victory is achieved through strategic use of roles, efficient building, and maximizing victory points.

**Objective:** Be the player with the most victory points at the end of the game. The game ends immediately after any player builds their 12th building.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds until one player builds their 12th building.

**Each Round:**  
1. The **governor** (starting player) selects one of the 5 role cards.  
2. That player performs the **action and privilege** of the role.  
3. Remaining players, in clockwise order, perform the **action** (but not the privilege).  
4. The next player (left of governor) selects a new role; repeat until all players have chosen a role.  
5. At round end:  
   - Return all role cards to the center.  
   - Pass the **governor card** clockwise.  
   - **Before the next round begins**, the new governor:  
     - Reminds chapel owners to place a card under their chapel.  
     - Enforces hand limits (7 cards, or 12 with a tower).  

**2-Player Game Exception:**  
- After each player picks a role, the **governor picks a second role**.  
- Thus, 3 roles are used per round: Governor → Opponent → Governor.  
- The **library** may only be used once per round by the governor.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Roles (Action & Privilege)  

| Role        | Action | Privilege |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Builder** | Each player may build **one** building by paying its cost in cards from hand. | Builder pays **1 card less**. |
| **Producer** | Each player may produce **one good** on an empty production building by drawing a card and placing it face down on it. | Producer may produce **a second good**. |
| **Trader** | Each player may **sell one good**. The trader reveals the top trading card to set prices. | Trader may sell **a second good**. |
| **Councillor** | Each player draws 2 cards, keeps 1, discards 1. | Councillor draws 5 cards, keeps 1, discards 4. |
| **Prospector** | No action for other players. | Prospector draws **1 card**. |

> **Note:** Only the player who selects the role gets the **privilege**. All players get the **action**.

#### Building Rules  
- To build: Play a card from hand face up, pay its cost by discarding cards.  
- **Production buildings (multi-colored):** You may have multiple of the same type.  
- **City buildings (blue):** Only **one copy per player** allowed.  
- **Cost cannot be reduced below 0.**

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End:** Ends immediately after the **Builder phase** in which any player builds their **12th building**. Do not continue the round.

**Scoring Order:**  
1. **Victory points** from all buildings (number on bottom).  
2. **1 VP per card** under **Chapel**, **Harbor**, or **Bank**.  
3. **Monument Bonuses:**  
   - **Guild Hall:** 1 VP per production building + 1 VP per **type** of production building.  
   - **City Hall:** 1 VP per city building (including itself).  
   - **Triumphal Arch:**  
     - 1 monument: 4 VP  
     - 2 monuments: 6 VP  
     - 3 monuments: 8 VP  
4. **Palace:** After all other points, divide total VP by 4 (round down), add that many VP.  
5. **Cathedral (expansion):** 4 VP for first opponent’s 6-cost building, 3 for second, etc.  
6. **Residence (expansion):** 4 VP for first set of 3 different same-cost buildings, 3 for second, etc.  

**Tiebreaker:** Players tied for most VP add:  
- Number of cards in hand  
- Number of goods on production buildings  
Highest total wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Hand Limit:** Enforced **only at the start of a new round**, not during. Tower allows 12 cards.  
- **Library + Role Privilege:** Library **doubles** the privilege (e.g., Builder pays 2 less).  
- **2-Player Game:** Governor picks twice; library can only be used once per round.  
- **Crane Overbuilding:**  
  - Cannot build over another crane.  
  - Cannot build same building over itself.  
  - Covered building loses function; goods are lost.  
  - Cards under **Chapel** still count for VP.  
- **Trading Card Stack:** Always return used card to **bottom** of stack, even if no goods sold.  
- **Event Cards:** Never in hand; resolved immediately when revealed.  
- **Multiple Privileges:** Effects stack (e.g., Builder + Quarry + Library = pay 3 less).  
- **Palace Calculation:** Done **last**, after all other VP are totaled.
