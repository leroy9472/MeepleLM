### 1. Lore & Objective
At the Japanese Imperial court, the Chinese Emperor gifted a giant panda to celebrate a diplomatic alliance. Players, as court members, collaborate to cultivate a bamboo grove, grow bamboo of three colors (green, yellow, pink), and manage the gardener and panda. In the cooperative variant, players work together toward a shared goal: completing objectives to earn a collective score. The group wins by maximizing shared victory points through fulfilled objectives.

### 2. Components
- 28 plot tiles  
- 28 green, 26 yellow, 24 pink bamboo sections  
- 20 irrigation channels  
- 9 improvement tokens (3 enclosures, 3 fertilizers, 3 watersheds)  
- 46 objective cards (divided into plot, gardener, panda categories)  
- 1 shared board (printable)  
- 4 individual player boards  
- 8 action tokens (2 per player)  
- 1 weather die  
- 1 panda figure  
- 1 gardener figure  
- 1 Emperor card  

### 3. Setup
- Place the pond tile in the center. Put the gardener and panda on it.  
- Shuffle the remaining plot tiles into a face-down draw pile.  
- Form three face-down objective decks by category (plot, gardener, panda), each with 8 cards. Place them on designated spaces on the shared board. Return unused objective cards to the box.  
- Each player takes one individual board and two action tokens. No personal objectives are dealt.  
- Place irrigation channels and improvement tokens in the reserve next to the board.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise. On each turn, perform two steps in order:

#### 1. Determine Weather Conditions
- Starting from the second round, roll the weather die.  
- Apply the result:  
  - **Sun**: Gain a third action (must differ from the two regular actions).  
  - **Rain**: Place one bamboo section on any irrigated plot (max 4 per plot).  
  - **Wind**: Perform two identical actions (optional).  
  - **Storm**: Move the panda to any plot; it eats one bamboo section.  
  - **Clouds**: Take one improvement token from the reserve (place immediately or save). If none available, choose another weather effect.  
  - **? (Wild)**: Choose any of the above weather effects.  
- If the result is **?**, instead of choosing weather, add one objective card from the top of any category deck to the shared board (face-up, available to all).

#### 2. Perform Actions and Complete Objectives
- Take two different actions (unless Wind was rolled).  
- Action options:  
  - **Plots**: Draw 3 plot tiles, choose 1 to place legally, return the other 2 to the bottom of the draw pile.  
  - **Irrigation**: Take one irrigation channel (use immediately or save).  
  - **Gardener**: Move gardener in a straight line; grow bamboo on the plot where it stops and adjacent irrigated plots of the same color.  
  - **Panda**: Move panda in a straight line; eat one bamboo section from the final plot.  
  - **Objective (not allowed in this variant)**: Drawing objectives is prohibited.  
- Bamboo eaten by the panda is pooled next to the shared board (not assigned to individuals).  
- At any time during their turn, players may complete objectives if conditions are met (no action cost). Completed objectives are placed face-up near the shared board.  

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Plot Placement**: New plots must be adjacent to the pond or to two existing plots.  
- **Irrigation**: Channels connect plots to the pond (cannot border the pond). A plot is irrigated if: adjacent to pond, has a channel on any edge connected to the pond network, or has a watershed.  
- **Bamboo Growth**:  
  - First irrigation triggers one bamboo section (two if fertilizer present).  
  - Gardener movement grows one section (two if fertilizer) on the final plot and adjacent irrigated plots of the same color.  
  - Max height: 4 sections per plot.  
- **Improvements**:  
  - Each plot holds one improvement (built-in or token).  
  - **Enclosure**: Panda cannot eat here.  
  - **Fertilizer**: Double growth (max still 4).  
  - **Watershed**: Self-irrigating; cannot start irrigation network.  
- **Objective Completion**:  
  - **Plot**: Configuration must match and all plots must be irrigated.  
  - **Gardener**: Bamboo configuration must exist; gardener must be on relevant plot.  
  - **Panda**: Required bamboo sections must be in the shared eaten reserve. Return them to supply upon completion.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End**: Triggered when the group completes a total of 9 objectives (regardless of player count). The player who completes the 9th takes the Emperor card. All other players get one final turn.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - Sum points from all completed objectives.  
  - Add 2 points for holding the Emperor card.  
  - **Chibis Expansion Rule**: Gain +3 points for each complete set of three objective types (plot, gardener, panda).  
- **Winning**: The group’s total score is evaluated. No individual winner—success is shared.  
- **Tie**: Not applicable (cooperative mode).  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Weather ?**: If rolled, add one objective to the shared board instead of applying weather.  
- **Panda Eating**: Eaten bamboo goes to a shared reserve, not individual boards.  
- **Improvement Placement**: Can be done as a free action during a player’s turn, on any empty (no bamboo, no improvement) plot.  
- **Irrigation Placement**: Stored channels can be placed as a free action.  
- **Objective Drawing**: Not allowed in this cooperative variant.  
- **First Round**: Skip weather roll.  
- **Max Bamboo Height**: 4 sections per plot; no growth beyond that.  
- **Movement Rules**: Gardener and panda move in straight lines from edge to edge; cannot cross gaps. Must move at least one plot to trigger action.
