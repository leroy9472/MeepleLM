## SCHOTTEN TOTTEN — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the Scottish Highlands, the villages of North-Scotsbury and South-Scotsbury annually dispute the boundary stones that mark their shared pasture. Each spring, as snow melts, the stones shift—prompting fierce competition to reassert control. Players act as village elders, deploying clan members (cards) to form superior tactical groups at each boundary stone.  

**Objective**: Be the first to claim either:
- Three adjacent stones, or  
- Any five stones in total.  

The game ends immediately upon meeting either condition.

### 2. Components  
- **54 Clan Cards**: Six suits (colors), values 1–9 (9 cards per suit).  
- **9 Stone Tiles**: Represent contested boundary stones, placed in a line.  
- **10 Tactic Cards** (Variant only): Special ability cards, divided into:
  - *Elite Troops* (3 types): Joker, Spy (7), Shield-Bearer (1/2/3)
  - *Combat Modes* (2 types): Blind Man’s Bluff, Mud Fight
  - *Ruses* (5 types): Recruiter, Strategist, Banshee, Traitor
- **Optional Player Aids**: Reference cards for formations and Tactic effects.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, perform these actions **in order** (unless Expert Variant is used):

#### 1. Play a Card  
- Play **one card** face-up on your side of any **unclaimed stone**.
- You may only have **up to 3 cards** on your side of any one stone.
- You may not play on a claimed stone.
- Cards remain fixed once played; order of play does not affect formation strength.

**Tactics Variant Additions**:
- May play either a **Clan Card** or a **Tactic Card**.
- **Restriction**: You may not play more than **one Tactic Card more** than your opponent has played.
- Tactic Cards are played:
  - *Elite Troops*: On your side of a stone (like Clan Cards).
  - *Combat Modes*: On the stone tile itself.
  - *Ruses*: Face-up beside the deck (discard pile); resolve effect immediately.

#### 2. Claim Stones  
After playing, check if you can claim **any unclaimed stone**, not necessarily the one just played to.

**Conditions to Claim**:
- You have **3 cards** on your side of the stone.
- Your formation is **stronger** than your opponent’s, OR
- You can **prove** the opponent cannot beat your formation, even if they haven’t completed 3 cards.

**Proof Rule**:
- You may only use **publicly visible cards** (on table) to prove impossibility.
- Cards in hand or deck composition are unknown and cannot be used in proof.

**Ties**:
- If formations are equal in type, higher **sum of card values** wins.
- If sum is tied, the player who **played their third card first** wins.

**Tactics Variant Clarification**:
- When claiming a stone where only one side has 3 cards, consider only unplayed **Clan Cards**, not Tactic Cards, when evaluating possible counter-formations.

#### 3. Draw a Card  
- Draw **one card** to restore hand size:
  - Base Game: Draw from Clan deck.
  - Tactics Variant: Draw from **Clan or Tactic deck** (player’s choice).
- If a deck is empty, skip drawing.
- Play passes to opponent.

**Expert Variant**:
- Turn order: **1. Claim**, **2. Play**, **3. Draw**.
- Allows claiming before playing, increasing strategic depth.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Formations (Ranked Strongest to Weakest)
1. **Color Run** (Straight Flush): 3 same-color cards in consecutive values (e.g., Red 4,5,6).
2. **Three of a Kind**: 3 cards of same value (e.g., 7,7,7).
3. **Color** (Flush): 3 same-color cards, any values.
4. **Run** (Straight): 3 consecutive values, any colors (e.g., 2,3,4).
5. **Sum** (Wild Rabble): Any 3 cards; compared by total value.

> **Note**: Runs need not be played in order. Formation strength depends only on final composition.

#### Tactic Cards

**Elite Troops** (played like Clan Cards):
- **Joker (x2)**: Choose color and value (1–9) when claiming. Each player may play **only one** Joker. Second Joker held until game end.
- **Spy (7)**: Value 7; choose color when claiming.
- **Shield-Bearer (1/2/3)**: Choose value (1, 2, or 3) and color when claiming.

**Combat Modes** (played on Stone Tile):
- **Blind Man’s Bluff**: Compare only **sums** of cards; formations ignored.
- **Mud Fight**: Requires **4 cards** on at least one side to claim.

**Ruses** (played face-up beside deck; resolve effect):
- **Recruiter**: Draw 3 cards (from either/both decks). Choose 2 cards from your **entire hand** and return them to the **bottom** of their respective decks.
- **Strategist**: Move one of your cards (Clan or Tactic) from an unclaimed stone to another unclaimed stone, or discard it face-up.
- **Banshee**: Discard one opponent’s card (Clan or Tactic) from an unclaimed stone, face-up.
- **Traitor**: Move one **Clan Card** from opponent’s side of an unclaimed stone to your side of another unclaimed stone.
