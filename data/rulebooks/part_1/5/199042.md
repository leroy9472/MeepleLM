## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of **four steps** (five in advanced variants):

### Step 1: Reveal and Resolve Dark Arts Events
- Reveal the number of Dark Arts cards indicated by the current Location.
- Resolve each event one at a time. Effects may include:
  - Adding Villain Control tokens to the Location.
  - Forcing Heroes to lose Health or discard cards.
- If the Dark Arts deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

### Step 2: Resolve Villain Abilities
- Each Villain has an ability that triggers each turn or under specific conditions.
- Resolve abilities from **left to right**.
- If a Horcrux is active (Game 7+), resolve its effect after Dark Arts but before Villains.

### Step 3: Play Hogwarts Cards & Take Hero Actions
As the active Hero, perform any of the following in any order:
- **Play Cards**: Gain Attack (■) or Influence (●) tokens. Set played cards aside (in a "play area").
- **Assign Attack**: Assign ■ tokens to Villains. When a Villain's Health equals assigned ■, it is defeated.
- **Acquire Cards**: Spend ● to buy face-up Hogwarts cards. Immediately place acquired cards in your discard pile.
- **Use Hero Abilities, Proficiencies, or Charms** (if applicable).

> **Note**: Cards are considered "played" even if their effects are blocked (e.g., by the Basilisk). Played cards are not in hand or discard pile until end of turn.

### Step 4: End of Turn
1. **Check Location Control**: If Villains have enough control tokens, they take the Location. Discard it and reveal the next.
2. **Replace Defeated Villains**: If a Villain was defeated, replace it with the next from the stack at the end of the turn.
3. **Refill Hogwarts Cards**: Replace any acquired cards with new ones from the deck.
4. **Discard Played Cards**: Move all played cards to your discard pile.
5. **Discard Unused Tokens**: Discard unused ■ and ● tokens.
6. **Draw 5 Cards**: Draw a new hand. If your deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Health & Stun
- Starting Health: 10.
- If Health drops to 0, the Hero is **Stunned**:
  - Discard all saved ■ and ● tokens.
  - Discard half your hand (round down).
  - Add 1 Villain Control token to the Location.
  - You may continue your turn if it’s yours.
  - At the end of the current turn, reset Health to 10.

### Card Play & Discard
- Played cards go to a "play area," not directly to discard.
- Discard effects (e.g., Neville’s Remembrall) trigger when a card is discarded due to:
  - Villain/Dark Arts effects
  - Hero choice (e.g., to activate an effect)
  - Being Stunned
- Discarding at end of turn does **not** trigger discard effects.

### Deck Management
- When deck runs out and a draw is required, shuffle discard pile to form a new deck.
- Newly acquired cards go directly to discard pile and will be shuffled in when needed.
- No cards are removed from the deck during the game.

### Horcruxes (Game 7+)
- Horcruxes are stacked face up. Destroy them one by one.
- To destroy: Roll House dice (via card effects) and match required symbols.
- Symbols can be accumulated over multiple turns.
- Active Hero who completes the roll collects the Horcrux and gains its power (usable only on their turn).
- Voldemort cannot be attacked until all Horcruxes are destroyed.
- Die rolls used on Horcruxes do not grant their normal benefits.

### Potions (Advanced Games)
- Potions Board has shelves with Ingredients.
- Each turn, gather one Ingredient per shelf if requirements are met.
- Ingredients can be used to brew face-up Potions.
- Completed Potions can be played immediately (for banish effect) or go to discard pile.
- Discarded Ingredients go to bottom of board; when exhausted, flip and reuse.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win**: Defeat all Villains.
- **Lose**: Villains control all Locations.
- No traditional scoring; victory is binary.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
### Timing Order
When multiple effects trigger simultaneously, resolve in this order:
1. **Stunning** (immediate, interrupts all)
2. **Dark Arts Cards**
3. **Active Horcrux**
4. **Voldemort**
5. **Villain Cards** (left to right)
6. **Discard Effects of Hogwarts Cards**
7. **Hogwarts Cards Played**
8. **Hero Abilities**
9. **Proficiencies**
10. **Horcrux Abilities (earned)**

> Card text always overrides timing rules.

### Key Clarifications
- **Discard Effects**: Trigger only if discarded due to effect, choice, or Stun. Not from end-of-turn discard.
- **Card Play**: A card counts as "played" even if its effect is blocked.
- **Banishing**: Optional unless forced (e.g., Cornelius Fudge).
- **Villain vs. Creature**: Some effects only trigger on Villains, not Creatures.
- **Polyjuice Potion**: Counts as an Item, not an Ally.
- **Multiple Voldemorts**: Only one in play at a time unless variant rule used.
