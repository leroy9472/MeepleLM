## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The Resistance is a social deduction game where players are either members of the Resistance trying to complete missions, or Spies secretly sabotaging them. The objective for the Resistance is to complete 3 missions successfully. The Spies win by causing 3 missions to fail, or if 5 consecutive mission teams are rejected during team voting.

2. Components  
- Character Cards (Resistance and Spy)  
- Mission Cards (Success and Fail)  
- Vote Tokens (Approve and Reject)  
- Team Tokens  
- Score Markers (Blue for success, Red for failure)  
- Leader Token  
- Round Marker  
- Vote Track Marker  

3. Setup  
- Select the game board/tableau for the number of players (5–10).  
- Use the correct number of Resistance members and Spies based on player count:  
  - 5: 3 Resistance, 2 Spies  
  - 6: 4 Resistance, 2 Spies  
  - 7: 4 Resistance, 3 Spies  
  - 8: 5 Resistance, 3 Spies  
  - 9: 6 Resistance, 3 Spies  
  - 10: 6 Resistance, 4 Spies  
- Shuffle and deal one Character Card face down to each player.  
- Randomly select a starting Leader and give them the Leader Token.  
- Place the Round Marker on Mission 1 and the Vote Track Marker at 0.  
- Give each player one Approve and one Reject Vote Token.  

Spies Reveal Phase:  
- All players close their eyes.  
- Spies open their eyes, identify each other, then close their eyes.  
- All players open their eyes.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three stages:

STAGE 1: Team Proposal  
- The Leader selects a team of operatives (possibly including themselves) for the current mission.  
- The required team size is indicated on the board for each mission.  

STAGE 2: Voting  
- All players vote secretly using their Vote Tokens: Approve or Reject.  
- If the majority votes Approve, the team is approved and proceeds to Stage 3.  
- If half or more vote Reject (including ties), the team is rejected. Then:  
  - Increase the Vote Track by 1.  
  - Pass the Leader Token clockwise to the next player.  
  - Repeat Stage 1 with the new Leader.  
- If 5 teams are rejected in a row, the Spies win immediately.  

STAGE 3: Mission Resolution  
- Each team member receives one Success and one Fail Mission Card.  
- Each team member secretly selects one card to play face down.  
- The Leader collects, shuffles, and reveals the cards.  
- Mission outcome:  
  - If all cards are Success, the mission succeeds.  
  - If one or more Fail cards are played, the mission fails—**except** for Mission 4 with 7+ players, which requires **two Fail cards** to fail.  
- Place a Blue Score Marker for success or Red for failure on the mission track.  
- Clear the Vote Track.  
- Move the Leader Token clockwise.  
- Advance the Round Marker to the next mission.  
- Begin the next round with Stage 1.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Secret Roles: Players know their own role only. Spies know each other at the start.  
- Team Building: Leader proposes team; all players vote.  
- Hidden Voting: All players vote on team proposals. Majority required to approve.  
- Secret Mission Play: Only team members play mission cards. Resistance must play Success; Spies may play either.  
- Dynamic Leadership: Leader passes clockwise after each mission (regardless of outcome).  
- Vote Track: Tracks consecutive failed team proposals. Reaches 5 → Spies win.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends immediately when one of the following occurs:  
  - The Resistance completes 3 successful missions → Resistance wins.  
  - The Spies cause 3 missions to fail → Spies win.  
  - 5 consecutive mission teams are rejected → Spies win.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Tied Vote: A tied vote counts as a rejection.  
- Mission 4 (7+ players): Requires two Fail cards to be sabotaged. One Fail is not enough.  
- Leader on Team: The Leader may include themselves in the mission team.  
- Vote Track Reset: The Vote Track resets to 0 after any mission is attempted (successful or failed).  
- Shuffling: The Leader shuffles the played Mission Cards to conceal who played what.
