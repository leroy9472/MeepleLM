## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Feed the Kraken*, players take on secret roles as Sailors, Pirates, or members of the Cult, each striving to guide the ship to their faction’s destination. The game is set during a cursed sea voyage where trust is scarce and manipulation is key.

**Victory Conditions:**
- **Sailors** win if the ship reaches **Bluewater Bay** (east).
- **Pirates** win if the ship reaches **Crimson Cove** (west).
- **Cult** wins if:
  - The ship reaches the **Kraken** in the north (Cult Victory), **or**
  - The **Cult Leader** is sacrificed on a "Feed the Kraken" space.

All players on the same team win together—even if eliminated before the end.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

Each round consists of four phases:

#### 1. Appointing the Navigation Team
- Captain chooses:
  - One player as **Lieutenant**
  - One different player as **Navigator**
- Cannot appoint self or off-duty players.
- Lieutenant and Navigator must be different.

#### 2. A Question of Loyalty (Mutiny Phase)
- Captain asks: “If you are not satisfied with my decision, let your guns speak!”
- All players (except captain) secretly place 0+ guns in one fist.
- All reveal fists simultaneously.
- Captain counts total revealed guns.
- Check Crew card: if total ≥ required number, mutiny succeeds.

**Resolving a Mutiny:**
- Player who revealed the **most guns** becomes new captain.
- Tie: tied players raise hands. Current captain eliminates tied players one by one until only one remains (who becomes captain).
- All mutineers (including new captain) discard **revealed guns**.
- Round ends; new captain begins next round.
- Off-duty players can mutiny and become captain.

**No Mutiny:**
- All players return guns to supply.
- Proceed to Navigation.

#### 3. The Navigation
- **Captain** draws top 2 navigation cards.
- **Lieutenant** draws next 2 cards.
- Both look at their cards, then:
  - Discard one card face down to Deep Sea (discard pile)
  - Place other card face down into Captain’s Logbook
- Close and shake logbook to randomize order.
- Pass logbook to **Navigator**.
- **Navigator** looks at both cards, discards one face down to Deep Sea.
- Keeps one card in logbook, returns to captain.
- Captain reveals chosen card and resolves effects in order:

1. **Move Ship**: Follow arrow color (blue, red, yellow) on current map space.
2. **Map Action**: If new space has an icon, resolve it immediately (see Map Actions).
3. **Navigation Card Action**: Resolve icon on card (see Navigation Card Actions).

**Silence Rule:** No communication during navigation until card is revealed.

#### 4. Off-Duty
- After navigation, give off-duty signs to players based on count:
  - 5 players: Navigator and Lieutenant get off-duty signs.
  - 6 players: Navigator gets off-duty sign.
  - 7+ players: No off-duty signs (unless Long Journey variant specifies otherwise).
- Players previously off-duty return to active status.
- Navigator and Lieutenant badges return to captain.
- Off-duty players:
  - Cannot be chosen as Navigator or Lieutenant
  - Can participate in mutinies
  - Can become captain
  - Off-duty sign ignored if too few players available

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Supply Line (Long Journey Only)
- When ship crosses supply line, each player refills gun supply to **3 guns** from general supply.

#### Re-shuffle
- If draw pile has <4 cards before navigation:
  - Combine draw pile and discard pile (keep face down)
  - Shuffle thoroughly → new draw pile
- Résumé cards (face-up in front of players) are never shuffled back in.
- Exception: If Archivist, Smuggler, or Look-Out causes mid-navigation depletion, reshuffle when pile is empty.

#### Denial of Command
- After seeing both cards in logbook, **Navigator** may refuse to navigate:
  - Says: “I will not carry out these commands but jump overboard instead!”
  - Places both cards face down in discard pile.
  - Is **eliminated** (silent, cannot reveal faction).
  - Triggers **Emergency Navigation**.

#### Emergency Navigation
1. Captain appoints **emergency navigator** (can be off-duty).
2. No mutiny allowed.
3. Lieutenant remains same.
4. New navigation proceeds immediately.
5. If emergency navigator also jumps, repeat process.
6. After successful navigation, game resumes normally.

**Fewer than 3 Players Left:**
- Captain randomly fills open roles (e.g., draws two cards, randomly picks one to represent lieutenant’s choice).

#### Character Cards
- Each player has one facedown character card.
- Can be revealed **once** at any time (unless effect turns it facedown again).
- Provides unique ability (see card).
- Remains face up after use.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

  - Ship reaches **Bluewater Bay** → **Sailors win**
  - Ship reaches **Crimson Cove** → **Pirates win**
  - Ship reaches **Kraken** → **Cult wins**
  - **Cult Leader** fed to Kraken on Feed the Kraken space → **Cult wins**
- All players reveal faction chips from sea bags.
- Teammates win together.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

**Q: Can a player win if eliminated?**  
A: Yes. As long as they were on the winning team, eliminated players win.

**Q: Can the captain choose themselves for map actions?**  
A: No, except for Cabin Search and Flogging—captain chooses another player.

**Q: What happens if the Cult Leader is converted via Conversion ritual?**  
A: Impossible. Cult Leader is already a Cultist. Only Sailors or Pirates can be converted.

**Q: Can a player be converted after Cabin Search or Flogging?**  
A: No. Players who underwent Cabin Search or Flogging are **unconvertible**.

**Q: Can a player without tongue become captain?**  
A: No. They are permanently ineligible.

**Q: Can a player without tongue participate in mutiny?**  
A: Yes. Their guns count toward total, but during captain selection, their gun count is treated as 0.

**Q: Does Drunk action affect off-duty players?**  
A: Yes. Drunk transfers captaincy to next player (clockwise) with fewest résumés—off-duty status ignored.

**Q: Can Emergency Navigator be off-duty?**  
A: Yes. Off-duty restriction is lifted during emergency.

**Q: Can the Cult win if the Cult Leader jumps overboard?**  
A: No. Only sacrifice via **Feed the Kraken** action counts.
