## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

In *Arboretum*, players act as curators designing beautiful tree paths in their arboretum. The goal is to score the most points by creating high-value paths of ascending-numbered tree cards while strategically managing hand cards to claim scoring rights.

This solo variant, *The Garden of Non-Forking Paths*, pits you against a hidden-information AI opponent named Q. You win not by beating a score, but by outmaneuvering Q in both number of scored paths and total points.

### 2. Components

- 48-card deck: 6 suits (tree species), each with cards numbered 1–8 (48 cards total)
- Player’s hand and arboretum area
- One shared face-up discard pile
- Tableau for Q’s face-up arboretum (built from your discards)
- Face-down pile for Q’s hidden hand
- Scorepad (optional)

### 3. Setup

1. Prepare the deck: Use 6 suits (48 cards), as in a 2-player game.
2. Shuffle and place the deck face-down in the center.
3. Deal 7 cards face-down to yourself.
4. Reveal the top card of the deck and place it face-up to form the initial discard pile.
5. Q starts with:
   - An empty face-up arboretum (tableau)
   - An empty face-down hand

### 4. Gameplay Flow

Players take turns until the deck is exhausted. You take all turns.

On your turn, follow these steps in order:

1. **Draw 2 Cards**  
   Draw one at a time. Each card may come from:
   - The top of the face-down deck  
   - The top of the face-up discard pile  
   You may mix sources. You may look at the first card before choosing the source of the second.

2. **Play 1 Card to Your Arboretum**  
   Place one card from your hand face-up in your arboretum:
   - First card can be placed anywhere.
   - Subsequent cards must be placed orthogonally (not diagonally) adjacent to an existing card.
   - Cards remain fixed once placed.

3. **Discard 1 Card**  
   Choose one card from your hand and place it:
   - **Face-up** into Q’s arboretum (tableau), not your discard pile.

4. **Refill Discard and Draw for Q**  
   After discarding:
   - Draw **one card** from the deck and place it face-up on the discard pile.
   - Draw **one card** from the deck and add it **face-down** to Q’s hand.

   (If the deck runs out during this step, stop when impossible.)

After your turn, your hand must contain exactly 7 cards.

### 5. Core Mechanics

- **Q’s Arboretum**: Built entirely from cards you discard. These are face-up and public.
- **Q’s Hand**: Built from cards drawn during step 4. These are face-down and hidden from you.
- **Q’s Scoring Eligibility**: At game end, for each suit with at least two cards in Q’s arboretum, Q attempts to score it.
- **Q Scores a Suit Only If**:
  - Q has the highest sum of that suit in their hidden hand compared to your hand.
  - (If tied, both you and Q may score the suit, per standard tie rules.)

- **Special Rule: The 8/1 Rule**  
  If you hold the "1" of a suit and Q holds the "8", Q’s "8" counts as 0 when determining who has the higher sum.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

**Game End**: The game ends when a player must draw from the deck and it is empty. You complete your turn fully (including discarding and refilling discard/Q’s hand as possible), then scoring begins.

**Final Scoring Steps**:

1. **Reveal Q’s Hand**  
   Turn over all cards in Q’s hidden hand.

2. **Determine Scoring Rights per Suit**  
   For each suit:
   - All players (you and Q) reveal cards of that suit in their hand.
   - Calculate the sum for each.
   - **Exception**: If you have the "1" and Q has the "8" of the same suit, Q’s "8" counts as 0.
   - Highest sum wins the right to score that suit.
   - Tie: both you and Q may score.
   - If no one has the suit in hand: all players may score.

3. **Q’s Scoring Limitation**  
   Q can only attempt to score a suit if they have **at least two cards** of that suit in their face-up arboretum.

4. **Score Paths**  
   Each player scores their **single highest-scoring path** per suit they have the right to score.

   **Path Definition**:  
   - Orthogonally adjacent cards in ascending value.
   - First and last card must be of the suit being scored.
   - Intermediate cards can be any suit.
   - Values need not be consecutive.

   **Scoring a Path**:
   - 1 point per card in the path.
   - +1 point per card if: path is ≥4 cards and all same suit.
   - +1 point if path starts with "1".
   - +2 points if path ends with "8".

   (A card may be used in multiple paths.)

5. **Win Conditions**  
   You win **only if both**:
   a. You score **at least as many** suits as Q.  
   b. Your **total score is strictly higher** than Q’s.

   If either condition fails, you lose.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **What if the deck runs out during step 4?**  
  Complete as much as possible. If only one card remains, use it to refill the discard pile; Q does not get a hand card. If zero, skip step 4.

- **Can Q have a suit in hand but not in arboretum?**  
  Yes. But Q cannot score that suit unless they have at least two cards of it in their arboretum.

- **Can I score a suit Q has a higher hand sum in?**  
  Yes — if you have the highest sum, you gain scoring rights, regardless of Q’s arboretum strength.

- **Can a single card be used in multiple paths?**  
  Yes, for different suits.

- **What if Q’s arboretum has only one card of a suit?**  
  Q cannot score that suit, even if they have high hand sum.

- **Ties in hand sum?**  
  Both you and Q may score that suit’s best path.
