- Advance person track marker by the number on the played card.  
- **Wildcard Card**: Play to take any available person tile.  
- **Displacement**: If palace is full, may remove an existing person (permanently discarded) to make space.  
- **No Recruitment?**: If player declines to displace, new person is discarded and marker does **not** advance.  
- **Note**: This phase is **skipped** in round 12.

#### Phase 3: Event

  - **Peace**: Nothing happens.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Initiative**: Determined by person track position. Top marker chooses first in each phase.  
- **Recruitment**: Requires playing a person card. Gains initiative based on tile number.  
- **Resource Management**: Yuan, rice, fireworks, palace floors, and person cards must be balanced.  
- **Event Adaptation**: Players must prepare for upcoming events using action and person choices.  
- **Privileges**: One-time purchase; Large gives 2 VP, Small gives 1 VP in scoring.  
- **Monks**: Score at game end: Buddha symbols × palace floor count where monk resides.  
- **Palaces**: Max 3 floors. Unoccupied ones decay after each event.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after the 12th round’s scoring phase.

**Final Scoring**:  
- 2 VP per **person** in palaces  
- Monks: **Buddha symbols × palace floor level** (per monk)  
- Sell remaining **rice** and **fireworks** for 2 yuan each  
- 1 VP per **3 yuan** (after selling)  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player farthest ahead on person track wins

**[Expansion Additions]**
