### 5. CORE MECHANICS  

#### 1. ROLL DICE  
- Roll **6 gray dice** (plus yellow dice if allowed by a card/tile).  
- Up to **3 rolls** per turn. After each roll, you may **set aside** any dice.  
- You may re-roll set-aside dice in later rolls (e.g., change your mind).  
- After final roll, resolve all dice.  

#### 2. RESOLVE DICE  
Resolve in any order. All dice must be used.  

##### VICTORY POINTS (★)  
- **Three-of-a-kind of 1, 2, or 3**: Gain ★ equal to the number.  
  - **111** → 1★  
  - **222** → 2★  
  - **333** → 3★  
- **Each additional matching die** → +1★  
  - Example: Four 2s → 2 + 1 = 3★  

##### WICKEDNESS POINTS  
- **111** → Gain **2 Wickedness Points**  
- **222** → Gain **1 Wickedness Point**  
- **333** → No Wickedness Points  
- Move your **Wickedness counter** up the gauge.  
- If you **pass or land on 3, 5, or 7**, take **one Wickedness tile** from that level.  
  - Only one tile per threshold (never repeat).  
  - Tiles are kept face-up and remain active unless discarded.  

##### ENERGY CHARGES (⚡)

- Store in front of you; spend to buy cards or activate effects.  

##### SMASH (💥)  
- **If you are in Tokyo**: All monsters **outside Tokyo** lose 1♥ per 💥.  
- **If you are outside Tokyo**: All monsters **in Tokyo** lose 1♥ per 💥.  
- Monsters wounded by 💥 may **Yield** (voluntarily leave Tokyo).  
  - Yielding monsters **still lose the ♥**.  
- **Wounding via cards/tokens ≠ Smash**: Only 💥 allows yielding.  
- **Elimination**: If a monster reaches **0♥**, it is **eliminated**. Discard its cards, tiles, and energy.  

##### HEAL (♥)

- **Starting your turn in Tokyo grants 2★** (including extra turns).  
- **Tokyo Bay has same rules as Tokyo City**.  
- If player count drops to **4 or fewer**, any monster in **Tokyo Bay must immediately leave** (even if not their turn), unless Tokyo City is empty (then move there).  

#### 4. BUY POWER CARDS

  - Spend **2⚡** to **discard all 3 market cards** and **reveal 3 new ones**.  
  - Can do this multiple times if you have energy.  
- **Power cards may heal monsters in Tokyo**, overriding dice limitation.  

#### 5. END OF TURN

- Pass dice **clockwise** to next player.  

### 6. SCORING & END GAME
