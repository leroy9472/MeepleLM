Players deploy astronauts via ships to claim zones, extract valuable resources (Ice, Sylvanite, Celerium), complete secret missions, and leverage unique character abilities to gain points. The goal is to score the most victory points over 10 rounds by controlling zones, fulfilling missions, and capitalizing on discoveries.

- Character cards (9 per color)  
- Ship cards (with capacities and destinations)  
- Destination tokens (1 per Mars zone and Phobos)  
- Resource tokens: 5 Ice (1 VP), 3 Sylvanite (2 VP), 3 Celerium (3 VP)  
- Event deck: Discovery, Action, and Mission cards

### 3. Setup  
1. **Prepare Game Board**: Assemble Mars in center; place Phobos and Lost in Space Memorial nearby.  
2. **Construct Launchpad**: Connect dock pieces to form 3 docks.  
3. **Prepare Priority List**: Randomly arrange one of each destination token in a column near the launchpad.  
4. **Prepare Ships**:  
   - Place Phobos destination token on rightmost dock if no Phobos ship is drawn.  
   - Shuffle ship deck; draw 2 cards and place faceup in left and middle docks.  
   - Replace any "Unknown Destination" ship; shuffle back into deck.  
   - Place remaining deck near launchpad.  
5. **Prepare Automa Players**:  
   - Choose two opponent colors (Automa).  
   - For each Automa:  
     - Remove Recruiter, Explorer, Femme Fatale, Soldier, and 2 random character cards.  
     - Shuffle these 6 removed cards and place facedown.  
     - Place remaining 3 cards (unseen) on top in random order.  
   - Place astronauts of each color in their play area.  
6. **Prepare Player Area**: Choose your color; gather character cards and astronauts.  
7. **Place Starting Astronauts**: Randomly place one astronaut from each player on each docked ship.  
8. **Place Resources**: Randomly place one facedown resource token in each Mars zone and on Phobos. Place one leftover token near supply.  
9. **Deal Starting Mission**:  
   - Shuffle mission cards.  
   - Deal 1 facedown to each Automa, 2 to you.  
   - Choose one mission to keep; return the other to deck.  
10. **Create Event Deck**: Shuffle remaining mission cards, discovery cards, and action cards together. Place facedown near supply.  
11. **Prepare Supply**: Sort point tokens by type. Place Ice Monopoly card faceup near supply.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 10 rounds. Each round follows these phases:  

1. **Choose Character**  
   - You choose one character card facedown.  
   - Reveal the top card from each Automa’s deck and place it facedown.  
   - Reveal all cards simultaneously.  

2. **Resolve Character Effects (Countdown 9 to 1)**  
   - Reveal cards in descending order (9 → 1).  
   - If multiple players reveal same number, resolve in clockwise order starting with previous round’s last resolver.  
   - Fully resolve each character effect before proceeding.  
   - Ships may launch during resolution (e.g., via Secret Agent).  
   - Discard used character cards to owner’s discard pile.  

3. **Land Launched Ships**  
   - Each launched ship (full or triggered) lands in its destination zone.  
   - Unload all astronauts into the zone.  
   - Flip facedown resource token in the zone faceup.  
   - Return ship card to discard pile; return destination token to supply.  

4. **Draw New Docked Ships**  
   - For each empty dock, draw one ship card and place faceup.  
   - If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  

5. **Assign New First Player**  
   - The player (or Automa) who resolved their character last becomes the new first player.  

6. **Advance Round Tracker**  
   - Move the tracker to the next notch.  
   - If it lands on a Production Phase or Reveal Discovery Phase, resolve it immediately.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Automa Behavior  
Automa actions are determined by their revealed character cards and the Priority List:  
- When placement choice is required (e.g., which ship to board), use the Priority List:  
  - Match destination token at top of list to a docked ship.  
  - If no match, use top token for "Unknown Destination" ship.  
- After using a token for decision, move it to the bottom of the Priority List.  
- Specific Automa card behaviors:  
  - **Recruiter (9)**: Remove card from game; shuffle remaining 8 character cards to form new deck.  
  - **Explorer (8)**: Move one astronaut from each adjacent zone into the zone at the top of the Priority List.  
  - **Scientist (7)**: Draw top event card; if Discovery, assign it facedown to outer zone at top of Priority List.  
  - **Secret Agent (6)**: Roll d2/d3 to choose which ship launches early.  
  - **Saboteur (5)**: Roll d2/d3 to choose which ship is destroyed.  
  - **Femme Fatale (4)**: Replace opponent’s astronaut in zone at top of Priority List where both colors are present.  
  - **Soldier (2)**: Kill astronauts in zone at top of Priority List with opponents present. Move astronauts from top non-Phobos zone (roll d3 for number moved).  
  - **Pilot (1)**: Place destination token from top of Priority List on ship (roll d2/d3 to choose ship).  

#### Production Phase (occurs 3 times)  
- Each zone with a faceup resource produces tokens equal to the dot count (1, 2, or 3).  
- Majority rules:  
  - Single leader: receives all tokens.  
  - Tie: tokens divided evenly (round down); remainder stays in zone.  
  - No astronauts: tokens remain in zone.  

#### Reveal Discovery Phase  
- Flip all discovery cards faceup.  
- Resolve effects based on phase icon:  
  - **Reveal Phase**: Immediate effect.  
  - **Third Production Phase**: Affects production (e.g., Even Ground, Mining Incident).  
  - **Final Scoring**: Affects final points (e.g., Subterfuge).  
- Action cards revealed this way are discarded.  
- Mission cards revealed go to respective Automa’s area for scoring.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Final Scoring Phase (after Round 10):**  
1. **Combine Automa Scores**:  
   - Treat both Automa colors as a single opponent.  
   - Add their point tokens and mission points together.  
2. **Score Missions**:  
   - Reveal all mission cards.  
   - Complete missions based on criteria (e.g., presence in zones, majority).  
   - Ties count as completion.  
3. **Ice Monopoly**:  
   - Player(s) with most Ice tokens gain 9 points.  
   - Tie: divide 9 points (round down).  
4. **Add Discovery Effects**: Apply point adjustments from discovery cards.  
5. **Total Score**:  
   - Sum mission points, point token values, and discovery adjustments.  

**Winning**:  
- **Beginner Mode**: You win if your score > each Automa individually.  
- **Expert Mode**: You win if your score > combined Automa score.  

**Tiebreakers**:  
- Highest total score wins.  
- Tie: player with most point tokens (any type) wins.  
- Still tied: share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Priority List Usage**: Only used when multiple choices exist. If only one valid action, resolve it without consulting list.  
- **Unknown Destination Ship**: First astronaut placed determines destination using a token from supply.  
- **Destination Token Supply**: Only one per zone available; returned when ship lands.  
- **Scientist Drawing Discovery**: If all outer zones have discovery cards, discard drawn discovery and look at one in play.  
- **Dead Astronauts**: Sent to Lost in Space Memorial (not a playable zone).  
- **Phobos**: Not adjacent to any zone; cannot have discovery cards.  
- **Travel Agent (3)**: Effect skipped entirely if no ship has room for 3 astronauts.  
- **Femme Fatale & Soldier**: Can target own astronauts if required.  
- **Mining Incident vs. Synergy**: Mining Incident takes precedence; no tokens produced.  
- **Subterfuge**: On tie for second-most, distribute tokens; if only one player present, tokens remain.
