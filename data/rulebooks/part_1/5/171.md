## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Chess is a two-player strategy game with origins over 1,500 years ago in Asia. The modern form, known as International Chess, evolved in Europe over 500 years ago and is now played globally. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king — that is, to place the king under threat of capture in such a way that no legal move can prevent its capture on the next turn.

### 2. Components  
- 64-square board (8×8 grid) with alternating light and dark squares  
- 32 pieces: 16 white and 16 black, consisting of:  
  - 1 King  
  - 1 Queen  
  - 2 Rooks  
  - 2 Bishops  
  - 2 Knights  
  - 8 Pawns  

### 3. Setup  
- The board is placed so that each player has a light-colored square on their right-hand corner ("white on right").  
- Pieces are arranged as follows (from left to right from White’s perspective):  
  - Rank 1 (White): Rook (a1), Knight (b1), Bishop (c1), Queen (d1 — on own color), King (e1), Bishop (f1), Knight (g1), Rook (h1)  
  - Rank 8 (Black): Rook (a8), Knight (b8), Bishop (c8), Queen (d8 — on own color), King (e8), Bishop (f8), Knight (g8), Rook (h8)  
  - Rank 2: White pawns on a2–h2  
  - Rank 7: Black pawns on a7–h7  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. White moves first.  
2. Players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn (except during castling).  
3. On each turn, a player must make a legal move.  
4. If a player has no legal move and their king is not in check, the game ends in stalemate (a draw).  
5. If the king is in check and cannot escape, the game ends in checkmate — the opponent wins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Piece Movement  
- **King**: Moves one square in any direction. Cannot move into check.  
- **Queen**: Moves any number of squares in any straight direction (orthogonal or diagonal).  
- **Rook**: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.  
- **Bishop**: Moves any number of squares diagonally. Remains on same color throughout the game.  
- **Knight**: Moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction, then one square perpendicular. It is the only piece that can jump over others.  
- **Pawn**:  
  - Moves forward one square; on its first move, may move two squares forward.  
  - Captures diagonally forward one square.  
  - Cannot move backward.  

#### Special Moves  
- **Castling**:  
  - The king moves two squares toward a rook; the rook moves to the square adjacent to the king on the opposite side.  
  - Conditions:  
    - Neither king nor rook has moved.  
    - No pieces between them.  
    - King is not in check.  
    - King does not pass through or end on a square under attack.  
  - Two types: kingside (O-O), queenside (O-O-O).  
- **En Passant**:  
  - If a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opposing pawn, the opposing pawn may capture it "en passant" as if it had moved only one square.  
  - This capture must be made on the very next move.  
- **Promotion**:  
  - When a pawn reaches the eighth rank, it is promoted to any other piece (queen, rook, bishop, or knight) of the same color. Most often promoted to a queen.  

#### Capture  
- A piece captures by moving onto a square occupied by an enemy piece, which is then removed from the board.  
- Pawns capture diagonally, not in the direction they move.  

#### Check and Checkmate  
- **Check**: A king is in check when it is under threat of capture on the next move.  
- A player in check must resolve it by:  
  - Moving the king to a safe square.  
  - Capturing the attacking piece.  
  - Blocking the attack (except against knights or pawns).  
- **Checkmate**: Occurs when a king is in check and no legal move can remove the threat. The game ends; the player delivering checkmate wins.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Winning Conditions  
- Checkmate: Opponent's king cannot escape capture.  
- Resignation: A player concedes defeat.  
- Time forfeit: In timed games, a player loses when their time runs out.  

#### Draw Conditions  
- **Stalemate**: The player to move has no legal moves and is not in check.  
- **Insufficient material**: Neither player can checkmate (e.g., king vs. king, king vs. king and bishop, etc.).  
- **Threefold repetition**: The same position occurs three times with the same player to move and all possible moves identical.  
- **Fifty-move rule**: No pawn move or capture has occurred in the last 50 consecutive moves by each player.  
- **Mutual agreement**: Either player offers a draw; if accepted, the game ends in a tie.  

#### Scoring  
- Win: 1 point  
- Draw: ½ point each  
- Loss: 0 points  
- Recorded as:  
  - White win: 1–0  
  - Draw: ½–½  
  - Black win: 0–1  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Touch-move rule**: In formal play, touching a piece with the intent to move obligates the player to move it (if it has a legal move). Announcing "I adjust" (or "j'adoube") before touching a piece avoids this.  
- **Castling with attacked rook**: The rook may pass through or end on an attacked square; only the king must avoid moving through or into check.  
- **Promotion without replacement**: A pawn may be promoted even if the desired piece (e.g., a second queen) is not physically available — an upside-down rook or token may be used.  
- **En passant timing**: Must be executed immediately after the double-step pawn move; otherwise, the right is lost.  
- **King vs. king endgame**: Always a draw due to insufficient mating material.
