### 1. Lore & Objective
Imperium is a deck-building game where players lead a civilization through history, expanding their influence, managing internal unrest, and pursuing victory through strategic development. Each civilization has unique mechanics and win conditions. The goal is to score the most victory points when the game ends, or win via collapse if the unrest pile is exhausted.

Key civilization-specific objectives:
- **Arthurians**: Complete quests and play the Graal card to trigger the end game.
- **Utopians**: Accumulate 24 Population Tokens and trigger the Solstice ability on their Shangri-La Journey Card.
- **Vikings**: Play their Harald Hardrada card to end the game.
- **Standard Civilizations**: Trigger end game by exhausting the main deck, developing the last development card, or flipping King of Kings face down.

### 2. Components
- Civilization-specific cards (Nation Decks, Power Cards, State Cards)
- Common Cards: Region, Tributary, Uncivilised, Civilised, Fame, Unrest

13. Tuck an Unrest card under each Region, Tributary, and Uncivilised card in market.
14. Place Progress token on each Civilised card in market without a ● icon.
15. Place Solstice Card randomly between two players; player to the left starts.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds clockwise starting with the player to the left of the Solstice Card.

On your turn, choose one:
- **Activate**: Take actions and use exhaust abilities.
- **Innovate**: Discard hand, then break through for a card.
- **Revolt**: Return any number of cards from hand to unrest pile.

Then **Clean Up**:
1. Add 1 Progress to any card in market (Carthaginians: 1–2 Materials; Qin: 1 Population).
2. Remove all Action and Exhaustion tokens from state card and cards in play.
3. Place 3 Action and 5 Exhaustion tokens on state card (Utopians: 3 Exhaustion).
4. Discard any number of cards from hand.
5. Draw up to hand size of 5.

After clean-up, next player takes turn. When Solstice Card is between you and next player, resolve Solstice phase before next round.

**Solstice Phase:**
- All players simultaneously resolve Solstice effects in any order.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Taking Actions:**
- Remove 1 Action token from state card.
- Play a card from hand; resolve effect.
- Place card in discard pile unless pinned or otherwise specified.
- Cards with ● or ● icon require matching state.

**Exhaust Abilities:**
- Move 1 Exhaustion token from state card to a card (or power card) without one.
- Resolve the exhaust effect.
- Cannot use if no Exhaustion tokens on state card.

**Break Through For:**
- Declare suit.
- Options:
  1. Take card from market of declared suit.
  2. If ●: take top of Uncivilised Deck.
  3. If ●: take top of Civilised Deck.
  4. If ●: take top of Region Deck.
  5. If no deck or empty: reveal from Main Deck until finding card of suit; take it and shuffle others back. If none found, gain 2 Progress.

**Reshuffling:**
- If draw deck empty and need to draw:
  - **Barbarian State**:
    1. If no exhaustion on Nation Deck and have Exhaustion on state card, place top Nation Deck card in discard. Move 1 Exhaustion from state to Nation Deck.
    2. If ● card placed, flip state card to Empire.
    3. Shuffle discard into new draw deck.
    - *Arthurians*: Place ● (nadir) card in play, not discard. Do not flip state.
    - *Vikings*: Placing ● (zenith) triggers game end. Do not flip state.
    - *Utopians*: Skip step 1 (no Nation Deck).
  - **Empire State**:
    1. If no exhaustion in Development Area and have Exhaustion on state card, pay cost of one Development card to develop it (place in discard). Move 1 Exhaustion from state to Development Area.
    2. Shuffle discard into new draw deck.

**Garrison**: Place card from hand under another card. Garrisoned cards score but are out of play. If garrisoning card is removed, garrisoned card goes with it.

**Acquire**: Take card from market of specified suit; gain tokens on it; if unrest underneath, take that too. Replace with new card and tuck unrest underneath if applicable.

5. Arthurian player plays Graal ● card.
6. Utopian player has ≥24 Population and triggers Shangri-La Solstice.

  - Cards with XVP: worth indicated VP.
  - Cards with ?: worth VP if condition met.
  - Cards with *: worth variable VP as specified (max 10 from * cards).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Reshuffling with empty Nation Deck (Vikings)**: When placing Harald Hardrada, game ends immediately.
- **Arthurians playing Graal**: Must be active quest; triggers end game.
- **Utopians journey**: Must have 24+ Population and trigger Solstice on Shangri-La card.
- **Multiple end conditions**: Resolve normally; if collapse occurs after scoring trigger, collapse takes precedence.
- **King of Kings**: Cannot be drawn while face-down cards remain in Fame Deck. When resolved, flip face down to end game.
- **Exhaustion limits**: Utopians only use 3 Exhaustion tokens per turn.
