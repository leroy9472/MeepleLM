### 4. Gameplay Flow (7 Rounds)
Each round follows this sequence:

**a) Starting Player Bid**
- All players secretly bid money.
- Highest bidder pays bank and chooses starting player.
- Tie: re-bid (must bid higher); if still tied, highest die roll wins.

**b) Party Platform Conference**
- Starting with starting player, each player:
  1. Draws to 3 cards if hand < 3.
  2. May discard any number from hand and draw replacements.
  3. May discard one face-up Party Policy card and replace it with one from hand.

**c) Shadow Cabinet Actions**

  - **Coalition:** Place coalition tile in state (enables coalition formation).

**d) Form Coalitions (Current State Only)**

- **Voluntary:** At least 2 matching policies → both agree.
- **Forced:** At least 3 matching policies → one may force coalition.

**e) Buy & Place Media Markers**

- Continue until all pass consecutively.
- **Media Control Resolution (after purchase):**
  - Starting with last state (furthest from current), then counterclockwise:
    - If a party has plurality of media markers in a state, they may exchange one face-up Public Opinion card with one from Exchange Pool.
    - New card must not duplicate or contradict existing face-up opinions in that state.
    - Discard old card; draw new card to maintain 6 in Exchange Pool.

**h) Convert Meeting Markers to Votes (Non-Current States)**
- Starting with furthest state, then counterclockwise:
  - Each party may convert some or all meeting markers (must have ≥5 to convert).
  - **Votes = Meeting Markers × (Coincidence + Popularity)**
    - **Coincidence Rating:** +1 per matching policy/opinion, –1 per contradiction.
      - Key Issue: ±2 instead.
    - **Popularity Rating:** Value on popularity track (–3 to +3).
    - **Minimum:** 0.5 vote per marker (round down final total).
    - Minimum total multiplier is 0.5.
  - Converted markers returned to supply.
  - Vote markers placed on vote track (max 50; ties resolved by stacking, last on top wins).
- **Cleanup:** If a party has >50% of total votes in a state, they may exchange one face-up Public Opinion card with one from Exchange Pool (same rules as media control).

- **Media Control:** Plurality of media markers grants opinion exchange and poll immunity.
- **Coalitions:** Forced or voluntary based on policy overlap.

- **Secured National Opinions:** Protected from replacement unless contradicted.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Final VPs from:
- **Total Seats Won:** Sum of seats from all 7 elections.
- **National Media Markers:** Sum of values on National Board (higher in earlier rounds).
- **Party Membership:**
  - Total membership.
  - Bonus: 1st = +10 VP, 2nd = +6 VP.
  - Ties for 1st: divide 16 VP equally (round down); no 2nd bonus.
- **National Opinion Matches:**
  - Star value for each matching Party Policy.
  - +5 VP bonus for each **secured** match.

**Total Score = Sum of all above. Highest wins.**
