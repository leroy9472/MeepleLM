5. Core Mechanics  
- Running the Race:  
  - House (or app) announces “And they’re off!”  
  - Rolls 2 dice, announces sum, moves corresponding horse 1 space right.  
  - Continues rolling rapidly; players bet in real time.  
  - Bonus Moves: Triggered when same number is rolled twice consecutively.  
    - 6/8 (red): +1 space  
    - 5/9 (orange): +2 spaces  
    - 2/3, 4, 10, 11/12 (blue): +3 spaces  
    - 7 has no bonus.  
    - Bonus Moves reset after third roll; new pair required.  
  - House calls “Snake Eyes!” (2) and “Boxcars!” (12) for VIP tracking.  
  - Announces each horse crossing the RED LINE; on third crossing, shouts “No more bets!”  
  - Race ends immediately when any horse reaches the 15th space (finish line).

- Placing Bets:  
  - Players place Bet Tokens on open Bet Spots before “No more bets!” or finish.  
  - Simultaneous, first-come, first-served.  
  - One token per spot; no moving or removing once placed.  
  - Bets can be placed on:  
    - Win, Place, Show (by horse number)  
    - Color Bets (left column: color wins; right: 7 horse finishes 5th or worse)  
    - Prop Bet Cards (e.g., “2/3 horse beats 8 horse”)  
    - Exotic Finish Cards (3 spots per card; max 1 token per card per player)  
  - Players may not place multiple tokens on same spot or same card.

- Resolving Bets:  
  - Winning bets: Payout = Bet Token value × multiplier on Bet Spot.  
  - Losing bets: Pay amount in red circle on Bet Spot (if present).  
  - No negative debt; players with no chips owe nothing.  
  - Bonus Bet Tokens:  
    - Value multiplies payout.  
    - Losing bets: Pay both Bet Spot and Token red circle amounts.  
    - Tokens with “2” and special symbol: negate losing payment (no cost on loss).  
  - House resolves bets using Win/Place/Show Tokens to mark top 3 finishers.

- Win, Place, Show Rules:  
  - Win: 1st place only  
  - Place: 1st or 2nd  
  - Show: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd  
  - Ties:  
    - 2+ horses tie for 2nd → all considered 2nd and 3rd; no one behind shows.  
    - Otherwise, 3rd or tied for 3rd = Show.

- Prop Bets:  
  - 5 face-up cards per race; resolved after race, then replaced.  
  - Bet that one horse finishes ahead of another or group.  
  - Ties = losing bet.

- Exotic Finish Bets:  
  - 1 Exotic Card revealed per race (up to 4 by final race).  
  - Each card has 3 Bet Spots.  
  - Player may place only 1 token per card.  
  - Examples: Photo Finish, Blow, Start, etc.

- VIP Cards:  
  - After races 1–3, each player dealt 2 VIP Cards, chooses 1 to keep.  
  - Benefits last for remainder of game.
