### 1. Lore & Objective

The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by efficiently managing resources, completing Orders, and excelling in the Queen’s Contests.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Place Boards**: Hive Board (side based on player count: 1–2 or 3–4) and Woodland Board (side “A” for standard game) in the center.  
2. **Hive Tile Stacks**: Sort Standard Hive Tiles into 6 stacks by type; place each in its designated Hive Box.  
3. **Supply**: Place Coins, Pollen, and Honey (sorted by type) near the Woodland Board.  
4. **Queen’s Contest Cards**:  
   - Sort into 3 color groups (Speed and Final).  
   - Randomly draw 1 of each type; place on Hive Board.  
   - Seed Speed Contest payouts:  
     - 2 Players: 20 coins on 1st place  
     - 3 Players: 20/10 on 1st/2nd  
     - 4 Players: 20/10/5 on 1st/2nd/3rd  
5. **Order Cards**:  
   - Sort into 2 types.  
   - Create 3 stacks (per player count: 2–4 players use all, 2-player adjusts).  
   - Place face down; flip top card of each stack face up.  
6. **Market Trackers**: Place 1 resource (Pollen or Honey) at top of each Market column. In 2-player, shift all down one space.  
7. **First Player**: Player who woke up earliest; receives First Player Marker.  
8. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each chooses a color; takes Player Board, 4 Starting Hive Tiles, 10 Beeples, 1 Forage Token, 1 Fan Token, and Player Aid.  
   - Starting Resources (based on turn order):  
     - P1 & P4: 1 Beeples, $5  
     - P2: 1 Beeples, $10  
     - P3: 1 Beeples, $15  
   - Place Starting Hive Tiles on Player Board to match Configuration Card (drawn randomly; green = Standard, yellow = Veteran). All players copy same configuration.  
9. **Nectar Field**:  
   - Sort Nectar Tiles by type (Wildflower, Rosemary, Cherry Blossom, Acacia).  
   - Remove tiles based on player count (e.g., 2 players remove 2 per type).  
   - Shuffle and place face up, one per space, in Field.  
10. **Forage Tokens**: Each player places Forage Token on a unique starting space along left edge (reverse turn order or random).  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, choose **A) Take a Tile** or **B) Recall Beeples**.  
If you lack enough Beeples to place in any Hive Box, you **must** Recall.

#### A) TAKE A TILE  
1. **Make a Beeline**:  
   - Assign 1+ available Beeples to a Hive Box.  
   - Stack all into one Beeline.  
   - If the Hive Box has existing Beelines, your Beeline must be **exactly 1 Beeples taller** than the tallest existing Beeline.  
   - Cannot choose if you lack sufficient Beeples.  
2. **Expand the Hive**:  
   - Take 1 Hive Tile from that Hive Box.  
   - Place in your Hive, touching at least one existing Hive Tile (yellow edge to yellow edge).  
   - **Decree Hive Tiles cost 5 Coins** (paid to supply). Others are free.  
3. **Take Hive Actions**:  
   - If placement creates **one or more completely surrounded empty cells**, activate all Action Icons on adjacent Hive Tiles.  
   - Activate in any order; all are mandatory.  
   - Each Action Icon can only be activated once per turn (even if adjacent to multiple new cells).  
   - Possible Actions: Forage, Produce, Market, New Bee, Accounting, Decree.

#### B) RECALL BEEPLES  
1. **Retrieve Beeples**:  
   - Remove all your Beeples from all Hive Boxes (including New Bee Box).  
   - Return to your Player Board.  
2. **Scout for Nectar**:  
   - Move your Forage Token up to 1 space (orthogonal only, no diagonal).  
   - **Cannot spend Coins** for extra movement.  
   - **Do not collect Nectar or gain Pollen**.  

#### Optional Actions (any time during your turn):  
- Move a Nectar Tile from your **NECTAR JAR** (if using Honey Pot expansion) to a matching empty Cell in your Hive.  
- Pay **any opponent 5 Coins** to move a Nectar Tile from **their NECTAR JAR** to your matching empty Cell (they cannot refuse).  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Hive Actions (triggered during Take a Tile)  
- **Forage**: Move Forage Token orthogonally. 1 space free; $2 per extra space.  
  - On Nectar Tile + matching empty Cell: collect Nectar.  
  - On empty space or unplaceable Nectar: gain 1 Pollen.  
- **Produce**: Place Fan Token in any space in your Hive.  
  - Each adjacent Nectar Tile produces 1 matching Honey (if empty).  
  - Remove Fan after.  
- **Market**: Choose one:  
  - **Sell**: Sell any quantity of 1 Honey type or Pollen. Gain Coins = current Market value per unit. Then drop that resource’s value by 1. If already at bottom, drop another resource of your choice.  
  - **Complete Order**: Discard required resources to complete a face-up Order. Gain the Order Card (for endgame VP). Activate the Action Icon below that stack (Forage, Produce, or Market). Must take before turn ends. At turn end, flip next Order in stack face up.  
- **New Bee**: Move 1 of your Beeples from Supply to Nursery (in New Bee Hive Box). You gain it on your next Recall. Counts for Contests immediately.  
- **Accounting**: Gain 5 Coins.  
- **Decree**: Take any one of the other five Hive Actions (even if already taken this turn).  

#### Cell Patterns  
Empty cells require specific border configurations to accept Nectar:  
- **Wildflower**: 3 surrounding Hive Tiles  
- **Rosemary / Cherry Blossom**: 4 surrounding Hive Tiles  
- **Acacia**: 5 surrounding Hive Tiles  

#### Queen’s Contests  
- **Speed Contests**: First to complete gets Coins immediately.  
  - Payouts: 1st (20), 2nd (10), 3rd (5).  
  - In 2–3 player games, last place gets nothing.  
- **Final Contests**: Score VP at game end.  
  - Payouts: 1st (20), 2nd (10), 3rd (5).  
  - **Tie Rules**:  
    - 2 players tie: both get full payout; next drops one rank.  
    - 3+ tie: all get full payout; no further payouts.  
  - Last place never scores (unless tied for last, then full payout).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Trigger (when either occurs):  
- **Four of five** resources cannot drop further (Market markers at bottom).  
- **Two of three** Order stacks are empty.  

After trigger, all players get **equal turns** (last player takes final turn).  

#### Final Scoring (sum all):  
- **Coins**: 1 VP per Coin.  
- **Honey & Pollen**: 1 VP per unit left in your Hive.  
- **Final Contests**: VP based on placement.  
- **Orders**: VP listed on each completed Order Card.  

#### Tiebreakers:  
1. Most remaining Resources (Honey + Pollen).  
2. Most completed Orders.  
3. Shared victory if still tied.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I activate the same Action type multiple times in one turn?**  
  Yes, if multiple distinct icons are triggered (e.g., two Produce icons). But each individual icon activates only once.  
- **Can I complete an Order during a Market Action from a Hive Action?**  
  Yes. Must complete before turn ends.  
- **Does New Bee count for contests before I recall?**  
  Yes. As soon as placed in Nursery.  
- **Can I sell zero units in Market?**  
  No. Must sell at least one to trigger value drop.  
- **Can I move Forage Token during Recall if I don’t want to?**  
  You may, but not required. Movement is optional.  
- **Can I use Decree to take another Decree?**  
  No. Decree lets you take any of the **other five** actions.
