## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *London*, players take on the role of prominent architects rebuilding the city after the Great Fire of 1666, guiding its development into the 20th century. The objective is to earn the most prestige by the end of the game through strategic development of buildings, acquisition of boroughs, and management of resources and poverty.

2. Components  
- Development board  
- 101 City cards (divided into Decks A, B, and C)  
- 20 Borough cards  
- 4 Score trackers  
- 48 Coin tokens (£1 and £3 denominations)  
- 12 Loan tokens (£10 each)  
- 44 Poverty tokens (1, 5, and 10 denominations)

3. Setup  
- Place the development board in the center.  
- Each player chooses a score tracker and places it on the 0 space of the prestige track.  
- Each player receives £5 into their building display (public information).  
- Separate City cards into Decks A, B, and C. Shuffle each deck, then stack them with C on the bottom, B on top of C, and A on top of B to form the City deck.  
- Deal 6 City cards to each player.  
- Place the three starting Borough cards (City, Westminster, Southwark & Bermondsey) face-up beside the board.  
- Shuffle the remaining 17 Borough cards to form the Borough deck.  
- The player who set up the game is the first player.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, in order:  
1. (Optional) Return Loan: Pay £15 to repay a £10 loan.  
2. Draw: Take 1 City card from the City deck or the Development board.  
3. Action: Perform one of the following:  
   a. Develop your City: Play one or more City cards from hand. To play a card, discard a card of the same color (brown, blue, pink) unless it’s an Action card. Pay any additional cost. Place the card on a new or existing stack. Cards cannot be stacked on others played this turn.  
   b. Buy Land: Purchase one of the three face-up Borough cards. Pay its cost. Place it on top of your previous Borough card (splayed to show location symbol). Gain immediate benefit (cards, prestige, poverty reduction).  
   c. Run your City: Activate face-up City cards in any order. For each:  
      - Pay activation cost (money or discard a card).  
      - Resolve effect.  
      - Flip face-down if required.  
      Must activate the top Borough card’s running effect (if any).  
      Then gain 1 Poverty token per:  
      - Stack in building display  
      - £10 of loans  
      - Card in hand  
   d. Draw 3 Cards: Draw exactly 3 cards from any combination of City deck and Development board.  
4. Discard: If holding more than 9 cards, discard down to 9. Discarded cards go to the top row of the Development board. If full, use bottom row. If both full, remove bottom row from game and shift top to bottom.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **City Cards**:  
  - Colored: Brown (economic), Blue (science/culture), Pink (politics), Grey (Paupers).  
  - Action Cards (e.g., Wren, Coffee House): Played during Develop action; no discard cost; removed from game after use.  
  - Pauper Cards: Cannot be played or discarded normally; only via card effects or over hand limit.  
- **Borough Cards**:  
  - Provide immediate prestige, card draw, or poverty reduction.  
  - Only the top Borough card’s ongoing and activation effects are active.  
  - Location symbols show N/S and river adjacency.  
- **Loans**:  
  - Take when unable to pay a cost or voluntarily. Gain £10 and a £10 Loan token.  
  - Repay at start of turn: £15 per £10 loan.  
  - Generate 1 Poverty per £10 when Running City.  
  - Unpaid loans lose 7 Prestige at game end.  
- **Poverty**:  
  - Accumulated during Run City action.  
  - Reduced by certain cards (e.g., Workhouse, Boroughs).  
  - Affects final scoring via poverty table.  
- **Card Drawing/Discarding**:  
  - Development board has 3/4/5 columns per row for 2/3/4 players.  
  - Cards discarded to top row; overflow to bottom; full board clears bottom row.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End Trigger**: City deck is empty at the end of a player’s turn.  
- Other players take one final turn.  
- Final Scoring Steps:  
  1. Gain 1 Poverty per card in hand; discard hand.  
  2. Gain Prestige from all City cards in display (face-up, face-down, covered).  
  3. Repay loans: £15 per £10.  
  4. Gain 1 Prestige per full £3 remaining.  
  5. Lose 7 Prestige per unpaid loan.  
  6. Poverty Adjustment: Player with least Poverty returns all theirs; others return that number.  
  7. Lose Prestige based on remaining Poverty using the board’s poverty table.  
- **Winning**: Highest Prestige wins. Tiebreakers:  
  1. Fewest Poverty  
  2. Most Borough cards  
  3. Highest Prestige value on a single City card

7. FAQ or Edge Cases
