## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The objective of the **Alternative Mob Difficulty Scaling** rules is to increase game difficulty and improve progression dynamics by adjusting mob composition and leader strength. The core goals are:  
- Bring more Minion miniatures into play, especially at low player counts.  
- Make the game harder without significantly extending playtime.  
- Improve Darkness Track progression (easier early, more intense late).  
- Empower Mob Leaders with increased health, dice, and XP rewards.

### 2. Components  
These rules do not introduce new physical components. They modify existing game elements:  
- Mob Minitures (Minions and Leaders)  
- Darkness Track  
- Mob Leader stats (health, enemy dice, XP)  
- Player count scaling logic  

No additional tokens, cards, or boards are required, though a modified Darkness Track may be used to track Minion spawn counts.

### 3. Setup  
Apply the following during standard game setup:  
- Determine number of Heroes (solo play counts as 2 Heroes).  
- Set initial Minion count per Mob:  
  - Minions = Number of Heroes / 2, rounded down.  
  - Example: 3 Heroes → 1 Minion per starting Mob.  
- Adjust Mob Leader health:  
  - Health multiplier = Number of Heroes / 2, rounded up.  
  - Example: 3 Heroes → ×2 health multiplier for Leaders.  
- Mob Leaders gain +1 Enemy Die (black die) in combat, up to a maximum of 6 Enemy Dice total per Mob.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
#### During Quest Play:  
- **Hero Phase**: Standard actions (Move, Attack, Trade, Recover, Special).  
- **Enemy Phase**: Mobs perform 2 actions, targeting closest Hero.  
- **Level Up Phase**: Heroes spend XP, gain skills, increase level.  
- **Darkness Phase**: Advance Darkness Track. Trigger spawn events as normal.  

#### Minion Spawn Scaling:  
- At Darkness Track spaces 2, 4, and 6, all *future* Mobs spawn with +1 additional Minion.  
- This stacks cumulatively:  
  - Round 1: Base Minion count  
  - Rounds 2–3: +1 Minion  
  - Rounds 4–5: +2 Minions  
  - Round 6+: +3 Minions  
- Example (3 Heroes):  
  - Round 1: 1 Minion  
  - Rounds 2–3: 2 Minions  
  - Rounds 4–5: 3 Minions  
  - Round 6+: 4 Minions  

#### Mob Leader Rules:  
- Health scaled by Hero count (rounded up).  
- +1 Enemy Die in combat (added to pool from Minions).  
  - Max 6 Enemy Dice per Mob.  
  - Example: 1 Leader + 3 Minions = 4 Enemy Dice.  
- Killing a Mob Leader grants **3 XP** (instead of 2) to all Heroes.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Minion Count Formula**:  
  - Initial = floor(Heroes / 2)  
  - Increases by 1 at Darkness Track spaces 2, 4, and 6.  
- **Mob Leader Health Multiplier**: ceil(Heroes / 2)  
- **Enemy Dice Cap**: 6 per Mob (Leader + Minions)  
- **XP Reward**: 3 XP to all Heroes per Mob Leader kill.  
- **Solo Play**: Treated as 2 Heroes for all calculations.  
- **Mob Activation**: Standard rules apply (2 actions, target closest Hero).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Standard MD2 victory and defeat conditions apply.  
- No changes to quest completion, XP accumulation, or level progression.  
- Increased difficulty comes from:  
  - More Minions later in the game.  
  - Stronger Leaders (health, dice).  
  - Higher XP rewards encourage aggressive play.  
- Game ends when quest objectives are met or Darkness Track reaches defeat space.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Does the +1 Enemy Die from the Leader count toward the 6-die limit?**  
A: Yes. The Leader adds 1 black die to the pool; total cannot exceed 6.  

**Q: Is the Leader’s health multiplier applied to base health or current level health?**  
A: Applied to the Leader’s current level health value (i.e., after level scaling).  

**Q: Do Minion increases apply retroactively to existing Mobs?**  
A: No. Only Mobs spawned *after* the Darkness Track reaches spaces 2, 4, or 6 are affected.  

**Q: Does killing a Leader with no Minions still give 3 XP?**  
A: Yes. The XP bonus applies regardless of Minion count.  

**Q: Can a Mob exceed 6 Enemy Dice if it has many Minions?**  
A: No. Total Enemy Dice are capped at 6, even if Minions + Leader would exceed it.  

**Q: Are Roaming Monsters or Bosses affected?**  
A: No. These rules apply only to standard Mobs (Leader + Minions).
