## Codenames: Pictures — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Two rival Spymasters know the secret identities of locations on a 5x4 grid of picture cards—each representing an Agent (Red or Blue), an Innocent Bystander, or the Assassin. The Spymasters must guide their Field Operatives to identify and contact only their own team’s Agents using one-word clues. The objective is to be the first team to contact all of their Agents. The game ends immediately in a loss if any team reveals the Assassin.

2. Components  
- Picture Cards (20 used per game, arranged in a 5x4 grid)  
- Key Deck (determines identity of each card: Red Agent, Blue Agent, Innocent Bystander, Assassin)  
- Agent Tiles (7 per team, plus one Double Agent Tile)  
- Innocent Bystander Tiles (4)  
- Assassin Tile (1)  
- Key Card Stand (for Spymasters to view the Key Card privately)  

3. Setup  
1. Divide players into two teams: Red and Blue. Each team selects a Spymaster.  
2. Spymasters sit adjacent to each other at one end of the table; Field Operatives sit opposite.  
3. Shuffle Picture Cards and place 20 in a 5x4 grid, face-up, with arrow indicators pointing to the top-left corner from the Field Operatives’ perspective.  
4. One Spymaster shuffles the Key Deck and draws one Key Card. Both Spymasters view it and place it on the stand so only they can see it.  
5. The lit starting team (Red or Blue) on the Key Card begins. That team must contact one extra Agent.  
6. Each Spymaster places their 7 Agent Tiles beside them. The starting team’s Spymaster takes the Double Agent Tile, flips it to their color, and adds it to their stack (total: 8 Agent Tiles).  
7. Place 4 Innocent Bystander Tiles and 1 Assassin Tile between the Spymasters.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds in turns, starting with the designated team.  
- On a team’s turn:  
  a. Spymaster gives a one-word Clue and a number.  
  b. Field Operatives discuss and guess one location at a time.  
  c. After each guess, the Spymaster reveals the identity using the Key Card:  
     - Own Agent: place matching Agent Tile. Team may guess again.  
     - Innocent Bystander: place Bystander Tile. Turn ends.  
     - Opponent’s Agent: place opponent’s Agent Tile. Turn ends.  
     - Assassin: place Assassin Tile. Game ends—giving team loses.  
  d. Team may continue guessing until:  
     - They make an incorrect guess (non-own Agent),  
     - They choose to stop, or  
     - They reach (N + 1) guesses, where N = the number in the Clue.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Clue Rules:  
  - Must be a single word (no phrases, abbreviations, or compound words).  
  - Must relate to the image content, not card position, letters in name, or color/shade.  
  - Wordplay (e.g., homonyms) is allowed, but Spymaster cannot indicate multiple meanings.  
  - Spymaster must spell out the clue if requested by team.  
  - No singing, accents, gestures, or facial cues.  
- Expert Clues (optional):  
  - "Unlimited": Spymaster says a word and “unlimited” instead of a number. Team may guess freely, but doesn’t know how many correct answers remain.  
  - "Zero": Clue with number 0. Team may guess freely, but no Agent matches the clue.  
- Guessing Limit: Maximum guesses per turn = N + 1, where N is the clue number. This allows catching up on missed prior clues.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when:  
  - One team contacts all their Agents → that team wins.  
  - Any team reveals the Assassin → that team loses immediately.  
  - A team contacts an opponent’s Agent or Innocent Bystander → their turn ends.  
- A team may accidentally help the opponent by revealing their Agent.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- What if the clue word appears in the picture name? → Not allowed. Clue must not reference letters or names.  
- Can the Spymaster clarify after giving the clue? → No. No verbal or nonverbal feedback is allowed once the clue is given.  
- Can Field Operatives ask for spelling? → Yes. Spymaster must spell the clue if asked.  
- What if all 20 cards are revealed without finding all Agents? → Game continues until all Agents are found or Assassin is revealed.  
- Can a team win if the other team reveals the Assassin? → Yes. The team that did *not* touch the Assassin wins.
