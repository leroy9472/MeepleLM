## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Antiquity is a strategic worker placement game set in a late medieval Italian-inspired environment. Players develop their civilizations by constructing cities, harvesting resources, and managing pollution and famine. The objective is to fulfill the victory condition of a chosen patron saint by building a cathedral. Each patron saint offers a unique victory condition and special ability. Alternatively, choosing Santa Maria as a patron saint requires fulfilling any two victory conditions but grants access to all special abilities.

2. Components  
- 22 wooden cubes (workers) per player in 4 colors (red, blue, yellow, black)  
- 4 cities and 16 inns per player  
- Building sets: most buildings available once per player, except:
  - Storage (16 total)
  - Fountain (16 total)
  - Cart Shop (16 total)
  - Fishery (12 total)  
- 4 player aids (each with city map, cost charts, saint tracker)  
- 12 city maps (3 per player)  
- 16 exploration counters (4 types: grain, olives, wine, sheep)  
- Famine level board and marker  
- 16 hexagonal map tiles (2 per player)  
- Hexagonal grass markers  
- Pollution counters  
- 48 goods counters per type (10 types: grain, olives, wine, sheep, fish, dye, pearls, gold, stone, wood)  

3. Setup  
- Assemble the countryside board using 2 map tiles per player in one of the standard configurations.  
- Sort exploration counters: 1 of each food type (grain, olives, wine, sheep) per player. Shuffle and place face-down on exploration hexes.  
- Each player chooses a color and receives:
  - 22 workers
  - 4 cities
  - 16 inns
  - 1 player aid with large city map
  - 6 wood
- Houses are placed on the "Cost of Housing" chart with 1 worker on each.  
- Randomly determine starting turn order using workers; place on turn order track.  
- Players choose starting city locations in reverse turn order.  
  - Must be fully on a designated starting tile.  
  - One city per starting tile.  
  - Cities may be built over any terrain, including sea.  
- Place famine level marker at 0.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of 10 phases:

1. **All Rise**  
   - Return workers from city buildings to supply.

2. **City Building (Secret Phase)**  
   - Simultaneously, players:
     - Build new city buildings by paying required resources.
     - Place workers on buildings to activate them.
   - Buildings function across all cities.
   - Cathedral construction triggers immediate saint selection.

3. **Determine Turn Order (Countryside Phase)**  
   - Order based on total workers on Cart Shops and Explorers.
   - Fewest acts first.
   - Ties retain previous round’s relative order.

4. **Countryside Building**  
   - In turn order, players may build:
     - One countryside building per manned Cart Shop.
   - Must be within zone of control (ZOC).
   - Actions may be interleaved (e.g., build inn, then expand ZOC, then build mine).

5. **Store Goods**  
   - Store leftover goods in manned Stores (1 good per square).
   - Excess goods discarded.
   - San Christofori/Santa Maria: unlimited storage in cathedral.

6. **Harvest**  
   - Collect 1 good from each countryside producer (farm, mine, woodcutter, fishery).
   - Goods under worker are harvested last.
   - When no goods remain:
     - Return worker to supply.
     - Remove empty fishery.

7. **Explore**  
   - Manned Explorer reveals one face-down exploration counter in ZOC.
   - Gain the resource shown.
   - If food is revealed, famine level increases by 1.

8. **Famine**  
   - Gain graves = Famine Level – (total food in harvest, stores, cathedral).
   - Granary reduces graves by 3.
   - Place graves:
     - First in empty city spaces.
     - Then on buildings (max 1 grave per square; never on houses).
   - Buildings with graves become unusable.
   - Cannot place grave → eliminated.
   - Famine Level increases by 1 after phase.

9. **Pollution**  
   - Generate 3 pollution per city.
   - Place pollution on unpolluted, unoccupied hexes in ZOC.
   - Manned Harbour allows sea pollution.
   - Manned Dump blocks others’ pollution in your ZOC.
   - Each Fountain reduces pollution by 1.
   - Manned Dump reduces own pollution by 4.
   - Unplaceable pollution → 1 grave per unplaced counter.

10. **Check Victory**  
   - Players with cathedrals check victory conditions.
   - Simultaneous check.
   - Tiebreaker: most unpolluted hexes in ZOC.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Zone of Control (ZOC):**  
  - Base: 2 hexes from city or inn (no sea crossing).  
  - Manned Harbour: adds adjacent sea and coastal hexes.  
  - Manned Stables: extends ZOC to 3 hexes.  
- **Building Costs:**  
  - Houses: variable cost (free for first 4, then food/luxury goods).  
  - Stores: 1 wood, any rectangular size; one worker to man.  
  - Other buildings: fixed cost (e.g., 1 wood, 1 stone).  
- **Countryside Buildings:**  
  - **Woodcutter:** on unpolluted forest. Costs 1 wood. Produces wood per adjacent forest.  
  - **Farm:** on unpolluted meadow. Costs 1 seed (same type). Pollutes adjacent meadows.  
  - **Mine:** on mountain. Costs 1 wood. First mine in range sets resource (gold/stone).  
  - **Fishery:** 2-hex building on shore. Costs 1 wood. Adjacent sea must be unpolluted.  
  - **Inn:** Costs 1 food. Requires Brewery. Extends ZOC.  
  - **City:** Costs 1 food, 1 wood, 1 stone, 2 luxuries. Must be in ZOC, not adjacent to other cities.  
- **Special Buildings:**  
  - **University:** man once to activate connected faculties.  
  - **Faculty of Philosophy:** ignore "different type" requirement for building costs.  
  - **Faculty of Theology:** raze cathedral (once/turn). Santa Maria cannot be razed.  
  - **Hospital:** remove 5 graves.  
  - **Forced Labour:** harvest 3 goods; discard first, keep next two.  
  - **Faculty of Alchemy:** clean one polluted area (center + adjacent).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Victory is achieved by fulfilling the patron saint’s condition:

- **San Nicolo:** 20 workers (in cities or countryside).  
- **San Giorgio:** enclose another player’s entire ZOC (can reach all their reachable hexes).  
- **Santa Barbara:** build every type of city building at least once.  
- **San Christofori:** store 3 of each food and luxury good.  
- **Santa Maria:** fulfill any two of the above conditions.  

Game ends immediately when a player meets their condition.  
Tiebreaker: most unpolluted hexes in ZOC.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can buildings be rearranged?**  
  Only Santa Barbara (and Santa Maria) may rearrange buildings during City Building phase.  
- **Can a cathedral be rebuilt?**  
  Yes, only if razed by Faculty of Theology. Santa Maria cannot be razed.  
- **What happens if I run out of a building type?**  
  If a limited building (e.g., Fishery) is exhausted, no more can be built until one is freed.  
- **Can I build over pollution?**  
  Yes, except for inns, fisheries, and cities — pollution must be removed first.  
- **Do goods under worker count for storage?**  
  Yes, they are part of your supply and count toward San Christofori’s condition.  
- **Can I trade buildings?**  
  No. Only goods and promises (non-binding) may be traded.  
- **Does Famine Level reset?**  
  No. It increases by 1 each turn after Famine phase.
