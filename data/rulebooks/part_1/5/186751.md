# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In "The Search for Prometheus," Hephaestus and Hades form an alliance to infiltrate Tartarus and free Prometheus, defying the will of Zeus. However, Zeus and Ares intercept their plan, seeking to stop them at all costs. The true conflict emerges not between gods and Titans, but between divine factions—Hephaestus and Hades versus Zeus and Ares—over control of fate and rebellion.

**Primary Objectives**  
- **Hephaestus & Hades**: Calm Cerberus by removing all Rage tokens.  
- **Zeus & Ares**: Exit the Olympus map through a blue area.  
- **Alternate Loss Condition**: If any god is killed or Cerberus is destroyed, the opposing side wins immediately.

## 2. Components
- Two game maps: **Styx** and **Olympus**  
- Miniatures for gods, heroes, monsters, and troops  
- Tokens:  
  - Net tokens (8) and lure tokens (4)  
  - Rage tokens (Omphalos) for Cerberus (4)  
  - Bait tokens (12)  
- Dashboards and unit cards  
- Art of War (AoW) cards  
- Activation cards  
- Omphalos (divine stone) tokens and cards

## 3. Setup
### Maps
- Place **Styx** and **Olympus** maps adjacent as specified.
- **Blue areas**: Deployment zones for Hephaestus and Hades.
- **Red areas**: Deployment zones for Zeus and Ares.

### Team Composition
| Players | Recruitment Points | Teams |
|--------|---------------------|------|
| 4      | 8                   | Individual control: Hephaestus, Hades, Zeus, Ares |
| 3      | 12                  | Teams: (Hephaestus + Hades) vs. (Zeus + Ares) |
| 2      | 12                  | Same as 3-player: (Hephaestus + Hades) vs. (Zeus + Ares) |

### Unit Deployment
#### Hephaestus & Hades
- On **Styx Map**: Each player places their god in a blue deployment zone of their choice.
- On **Olympus Map**: Place 12 bait tokens face-down across the map (one per area; none on deployment zones).
- Acamas and Medusa: Placed on any blue area of the controlling player’s choice.

#### Zeus & Ares
- On **Styx Map**:  
  - Cerberus starts on the orange-highlighted area.  
  - Caucasian Eagle placed on any red area of its player’s choice.  
- On **Olympus Map**: Zeus and Ares placed on any red area of their choice.
- All other units enter during first activation; player chooses which map.
- Place 4 Omphalos tokens as shown on Styx map.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Start of Turn Phase**  
   - Resolve end-of-round effects.  
   - Draw 1 card.  
   - Choose to pass (draw second card) or continue.

2. **Activate a Unit Phase**  
   - Discard matching activation card.  
   - Declare simple actions (up to 2) or 1 complex action.  
   - Resolve start-of-activation powers.  
   - Perform actions.  
   - Resolve end-of-activation powers.

3. **Activate Another Unit Phase**  
   - Discard 1 AoW card to activate a second unit.

4. **End of Turn Phase**  
   - Optionally discard 1 AoW card to perform troop recall.  
   - Next player’s turn begins.

**Special Rule: Map Separation**  
- Units cannot move, attack, or use powers between maps.  
- **Exception**: Recall maneuver allows a troop to be recalled to:  
  - The area of a god the player controls (regardless of map), or  
  - One of the player’s deployment areas on any map.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Cerberus' Rage
- Starts with 4 Rage tokens (Omphalos on base).  
- **Special Rules**:  
  - Blazing Fire costs no Art of War cards.  
  - May always use Mighty Throw Talent regardless of roll results.  
  - If enemies are present in its area, **must attack** (simple attack or power); cannot move until area is clear.  

- **Calm Action** (by Hephaestus or Hades):  
  - Simple action.  
  - Removes 1 Rage token.  
  - Counts as the unit’s attack action for that activation.

- **Enrage Action** (by Zeus or Ares):  
  - Performed by any unit in same area as Cerberus and an unclaimed Omphalos.  
  - Moves Omphalos to Cerberus’ base as a Rage token.  
  - Cerberus cannot enrage itself.

### Hephaestus' Net
- 8 net tokens and 4 lure tokens placed face-down on Olympus map at start.  
- When an enemy unit enters an area with a token:  
  - Flip token.  
  - If **net**, unit is **trapped**.  
  - If **lure**, nothing happens.

- **Cautious Move (Zeus & Ares units only)**:  
  - Special action.  
  - Move up to normal speed.  
  - Stops movement upon entering an area with a token.

### Trapped Units
- Net token placed on unit’s base.  
- **Effects**:  
  - Cannot perform actions, use talents, or use powers.  
  - Suffers -1 Defense.  
- **Removal**:  
  - Trapped unit ends activation (automatically removed).  
  - OR friendly unit in same area uses simple action and discards 1 AoW card.  
- **Movement**:  
  - If moved (e.g., by Mighty Throw), net is removed.  
  - If moved into another token area, it may be trapped again.

- **Petrification tokens** can coexist with net tokens.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### Victory Conditions
- **Hephaestus & Hades Win If**:  
  - Cerberus has **0 Rage tokens** remaining.

- **Zeus & Ares Win If**:  
  - A god (Zeus or Ares) **exits Olympus map through a blue area**.

- **Instant Loss Conditions (for either side)**:  
  - A **god is killed** → opposing side wins.  
  - **Cerberus is destroyed** → opposing side wins.

### Victory Bonus
- Winner(s) gain pre-deployed units in **Scenario 3** of the campaign.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can units move between maps?**  
  No. Maps are fully separate except for Recall maneuver.

- **Can a unit be trapped and petrified simultaneously?**  
  Yes. Net and Petrify tokens can stack.

- **Does removing a Rage token count as calming Cerberus?**  
  Yes. Each Calm action removes one Rage token.

- **Can Cerberus be moved while enraged?**  
  Only by effects that bypass its "must attack" rule (e.g., Mighty Throw), but it still cannot move freely while enemies are in its area.

- **What happens to bait tokens when flipped?**  
  They are removed from the game with no effect.

- **Can a unit with Cautious Move avoid being trapped?**  
  Yes, by stopping movement when entering a token area. However, if forced to move (e.g., Mighty Throw), it will trigger the trap.
