## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are the CEO of a smartphone startup aiming to dominate the global market. Your goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) over 5 rounds by selling goods, controlling regions, researching technologies, and securing patents and directives. The player with the most VP at the end of Round 5 wins. Ties are broken first by number of Technologies researched, then by number of Patents.

### 2. Components  
- Game Board (world map with regions, phase/round track, technology & improvement areas)  
- VP Scoreboard (tracks player scores)  
- 5 Player Sets:  
  - 2 Pads (black and white icons)  
  - Player Screen  
  - Organizer Box (with sections for goods, progress markers, office markers)  
  - 12 Progress Markers (stairs)  
  - 18 Office Markers (buildings)  
  - 20 Goods Markers (cubes)  
  - 1 Starting Improvement Tile (2x1, player-colored)  
- Shared Components:  
  - 6 Patent Tiles  
  - 6 Technology Tiles (double-sided)  
  - 27 Improvement Tiles (2x1, yellow side for crate use)  
  - 20 Crate Tokens (1x1, yellow)  
  - 7 Retailer Tiles (S, M, L sizes)  
  - Round and Phase Markers  
  - Steve AI Components (Steve’s Pad, Marker, Rulebook) – optional  
  - Directive Tiles (expansion)  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place game board, VP scoreboard, and round/phase markers (Round 1, Phase 1).  
2. Place 6 Patent tiles on matching tech spaces at bottom of board.  
3. Place 6 Technology tiles next to patents (choose side; recommend non-darkened corners for first game).  
4. Shuffle 2x1 Improvement tiles into face-down stack; reveal 5 face-up in Improvement Block.  
5. Place Crate Tokens next to stack.  
6. Each player:  
   - Choose color, take matching components.  
   - Place starting Office Marker in home region (per screen).  
   - Place VP cube on VP board on color-matched starting space.  
   - Place price cube on "5" in Price Block (left to right by VP board order).  
   - Take starting 2x1 Improvement tile.  
7. **Retailer Placement (2–4 players):**  
   - 2 players: Cover China, Canada, Caribbean, all unoccupied M-regions.  
   - 3 players: Cover Europe, RSA, all unoccupied M-regions.  
   - 4 players: Cover Canada, 1 unoccupied M-region.  
   - 5 players: No Retailers.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of 8 phases:

#### Phase 1. Planning  
- All players simultaneously arrange their 2 Pads behind screens.  
- Rules:  
  - Pads must be parallel/perpendicular.  
  - One Pad must cover 1–4 cells of the other.  
  - 2x1 Improvements may be placed face-up on Pads, covering exactly 2 cells (may overhang only if 4G tech is researched).  
  - Improvements may be placed facedown off-board to produce 1 Goods each in Phase 3.  
- Covered cells = inactive. Exposed symbols = active.  

#### Phase 2. Set Prices  
- Base price: 5.  
- Each active −$ on Pad reduces price by 1.  
- Each active +$ on Pad increases price by 1.  
- Move price cube accordingly in Price Block.  

#### Phase 3. Production  
- Each active  
- Each covered cell on Pads produces 1  
- Each facedown Improvement or Crate Token produces 1  
- Additional production may come from Technology effects.  

#### Phase 4. Improve Production (SKIP in Round 5)  
- In Priority Order:  
  - If player has active  
  - Otherwise, gain 1 Crate Token (produces 1  
- New Improvements cannot be used until next round.  

#### Phase 5. Research Technology  
- In Priority Order:  
  - Gain 1 Progress Marker (  
  - Spend all  
  - To research a Technology, place  
  - First player to complete research takes Patent tile, removes it, and places 1 Office Marker on tech.  
  - Patent removal reduces tech cost by 1 for all other players.  
  - Unspent  
- Players may complete research immediately if they now meet reduced cost on their turn.  

#### Phase 6. Logistics  
- In Priority Order:  
  - Gain 1  
  - Place all  
  - Must be placed in regions adjacent to existing  
  - Once  
  - New  
- **Retailer Rule:** When completing a region with a Retailer, place  
- Bonus actions may be triggered (see Retailer Bonuses).  
- May spend 1  
- Technologies may modify this phase (e.g., WI-FI allows 2nd  

#### Phase 7. Selling Goods  
- In Priority Order:  
  - Sell  
  - Must have  
  - Cannot sell in regions with Retailers.  
  - Must place  
  - **Red Buyers:** Pay up to shown number. Player’s price must be ≤ number.  
  - **Purple Buyers:** Pay any price, but player must have required Technology.  
  - Only 1  
  - Must sell from left to right; cannot skip willing buyers.  
  - Extra  
- Technologies may allow exceptions (e.g., NFC allows direct sale without placing  

#### Phase 8. Receive VP  
- **Goods Sold:** Multiply number of  
- **Region Control:**  
  - Player with most  
  - 2nd place VP awarded if indicated.  
  - Tiebreaker: Player with leftmost  
- Record VP on scoreboard.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Priority Rule  
Turn order is determined at start of each phase:  
1. Lowest price first.  
2. Tie? Lowest current VP (excluding endgame bonuses).  
3. Still tied? Player with lowest starting VP (top row of VP board) goes first.  

#### Improvements  
- 2x1 tiles:  
  - Face-up on Pads: Covers 2 cells, modifies active symbols.  
  - Face-down off-board: Produces 1  
- Cannot be used same round acquired.  

#### Technologies  
Each grants a permanent or one-time bonus. Examples:  
- **GPS:**  
- **WI-FI:** Once per round, add 2nd  
- **NFC:** Sell up to 3  
- **4G:** Improvements may overhang Pads; sell 1  
- **LI-ION:**  
- **GAMEPAD:** Reduce tech cost by 1.  

#### Retailers  
- Block selling in region.  
- Players may still expand into region via Logistics.  
- Place  
- Gain one-time bonus (e.g., goods, research, price change, move  
- Cannot have more than 1  

#### Directives (Expansion)  
- Public goal tiles (5/6/7/8 for 2/3/4/5 players).  
- Any player who meets goal may claim it **during relevant phase**, once per round.  
- Only one Directive per player per round.  
- Claimed tile placed face-up; flipped face-down at end of round.  
- Score VP at end of game.  

#### Steve (AI)  
- Optional opponent.  
- Uses fixed Pad.  
- Phases followed per rulebook:  
  - Phase 4: Takes top Improvement, places in Delay.  
  - Phase 5: Prioritizes techs with Patent, then cheapest.  
  - Phase 6: Moves to largest, least occupied region (alphabetical tiebreak).  
  - Phase 7: Sells 1  
- Scores VP normally.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After Phase 8 of Round 5:  
1. Add VP from:  
   - Goods sold and region control (as normal).  
   - Patents (shown on tile).  
   - Retailers (red VP number next to  
   - Directives (if expansion used).  
2. Total VP determines winner.  
**Tiebreakers:**  
1. Most Technologies researched.  
2. Most Patents.  
3. Shared victory if still tied.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place Improvements under Pads?** Yes, as long as both cells are on a Pad.  
- **Can I skip a willing buyer?** No. Must sell to leftmost willing buyer first.  
- **Can two players tie on price and VP?** Yes. Tiebroken by starting VP (top row of scoreboard).  
- **Can I change Pad position after Phase 1?** No. Decision is final.  
- **Do covered cells from Improvements produce goods?** No. Only Pad overlap and active  
- **Can I have more than one** Only via Technology (e.g., WI-FI) or Retailer bonus.  
- **Can I sell to purple buyers before red?** No. Must go left to right.
