## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In **MINDBUG**, players command hybrid creatures in tactical battles against their opponent. The core twist is the **Mindbug** mechanic: whenever you play a creature, your opponent may hijack it using a Mindbug. Victory comes through clever timing, bluffing, and tactical combat—playing powerful cards at the wrong time can backfire catastrophically.

**Objective**: Reduce your opponent’s life total to zero to win immediately.

### 2. Components
- 48 Creature Cards  
- 4 Mindbug Cards  
- Rules Sheet  

*(Note: Additional tokens or dice may be used to track life, but unused creature cards are the default.)*

### 3. Setup

1. **Deal Mindbugs**:  
   Each player receives 2 Mindbug Cards. Place them face up in front of you (active and visible).

2. **Shuffle and Deal Decks**:  
   Shuffle the 48 creature cards. Deal 10 cards face down to each player as their personal draw pile.  
   The remaining 28 cards form a reserve pile (used for life tracking and replacements).

3. **Draw Starting Hands**:  
   Each player draws 5 cards from their draw pile.

4. **Set Life Points**:  
   Each player starts with 3 life points. Take 3 cards from the reserve pile and place them face down in front of you to represent life. Rotate them sideways for clarity.  
   *(Optional: Use tokens or dice instead.)*

5. **Determine First Player**:  
   Each player reveals a random card from the reserve pile. Compare power values. The player with the higher power goes first. Retie on ties.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

Players take turns. On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

#### A. Play a Creature Card
- Select any card from your hand and place it face up.
- **Opponent Response**:
  - If they have at least one active (face-up) Mindbug, they may **spend one** to hijack the creature.
    - They place the creature in **their** play area.
    - The **Play** effect triggers for **them**.
    - They turn one Mindbug face down (used).
    - Your turn ends, and you immediately take **another turn**.
  - If they **refuse** or **cannot** spend a Mindbug:
    - You place the creature in **your** play area.
    - Resolve its **Play** effect (if any).
    - Your turn ends.

> **Note**: Mindbug hijacking only applies when a card is **played from hand**. Cards entering play via effects (e.g., from discard) cannot be Mindbugged.

#### B. Attack with a Creature
- Choose **one** creature in your play area to attack.
- **Opponent Response**:
  - They may choose **one** creature from their play area to block.
    - If they block:
      - Compare power values.
      - Lower power creature is **defeated** (sent to its owner’s discard pile).
      - If powers are equal, **both** creatures are defeated.
    - If they **do not block**, they **lose 1 life point**.
- **Hunter Keyword Interaction**:
  - If the attacking creature has **Hunter**, you may **choose** which enemy creature must block (if any is available).
  - That creature **must** block if able.
  - You cannot choose to attack directly if using Hunter.

> **Note**: Attack order and blockers are decided before combat resolution.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Keywords
Each keyword appears on creature cards and modifies gameplay:

- **Frenzy**: If this creature attacks and **survives** its first attack, it may attack **a second time** this turn.
- **Hunter**: When this creature attacks, you may **choose** the blocking creature (if any). That creature **must** block.
- **Poisonous**: This creature **always defeats** the enemy creature in combat, even if its power is lower.  
  *(If enemy has equal or higher power, both are defeated.)*
- **Sneaky**: This creature can **only be blocked** by creatures with **Sneaky**.  
  *(It may block normally.)*
- **Tough**: If this creature would be defeated and is **not exhausted**, exhaust it (rotate 90°) instead.  
  *(Exhausted creatures function normally—can attack, block, use abilities.)*

#### Triggers
Abilities activate under specific conditions:

- **Play**: Triggers when the creature enters play (regardless of how).  
  - If hijacked via Mindbug, **the hijacker** resolves the Play effect.
- **Attack**: Triggers **when the creature attacks**, before blocker is chosen.
- **Defeated**: Triggers **when the creature is moved from play to discard pile** (e.g., in combat or via effect).  
  - Does **not** trigger if the creature is taken control of, returned to hand, or discarded from hand.

#### Constant Abilities
Abilities without a trigger word (Play/Attack/Defeated) are **always active** while the creature is in play and conditions are met.

#### Drawing Cards
- After playing, discarding, or otherwise removing a card from hand, **immediately draw cards** until you have **5 cards in hand**.
- This happens **before** any other effects (e.g., before Mindbug hijack or Play effects).
- If your draw pile is empty, do not draw.

#### Resolving Effects
- Resolve as much of an effect as possible.
- If part cannot be resolved (e.g., discard 2 cards but only have 1), resolve what you can and ignore the rest.

#### Simultaneous Effects
- When multiple effects occur at the same time (e.g., two creatures defeated in combat), the **active player** chooses resolution order.

#### Game Terms
- **Allied Creature**: A creature in **your** play area.
- **Enemy Creature**: A creature in **opponent’s** play area.
- **Discard**: Move a card from **hand** to **discard pile**.
- **Steal**: Take a card from **opponent’s hand** into **your hand**.
- **Take Control**: Move a creature from opponent’s play area to **your** play area.  
  - Does **not** trigger Play effects.
  - State (e.g., exhausted) is retained.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: Reduce opponent’s life to **0**. You win **immediately**.
- **Lose a Life**: Remove one life card from your life pile. If you have no life cards left, you lose.
- **Gain a Life**: Take a card from the reserve pile and add it to your life pile (e.g., via card effect).

Game ends when one player reaches 0 life.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

**Q: Can I Mindbug a creature that was played via an effect (not from hand)?**  
A: No. Mindbug only works when a creature is **played from hand**.

**Q: If I Mindbug a creature, do I get to use its Play ability?**  
A: Yes. The **Play** effect triggers for **you**, as the one who controls it when it enters play.

**Q: Does Frenzy allow a second attack if the creature is blocked but survives?**  
A: Yes. As long as it is **not defeated**, it can attack again.

**Q: Can a Sneaky creature block a non-Sneaky attacker?**  
A: Yes. Sneaky only restricts **blocking the Sneaky creature**, not its ability to block.

**Q: What happens if a Tough creature is defeated while exhausted?**  
A: It is **defeated** and sent to discard pile (Tough only triggers if not exhausted).

**Q: If I lose a turn due to an effect, do I still draw to 5?**  
A: No. Drawing only happens when you **remove a card from hand**, not on turn start.

**Q: Can I use a Mindbug on a creature my opponent Mindbugged from me?**  
A: No. You cannot Mindbug a creature that was already hijacked.
