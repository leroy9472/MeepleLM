## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In a post-apocalyptic world, players lead one of four factions (New York, Appalachian Federation, Merchants Guild, or Mutants) in building a new State. The goal is to expand influence through conquering land, developing regions, and undermining rivals. Victory is achieved by being the first to reach 25 Victory Points (VP) and maintaining the highest score after final scoring.

### 2. Components

  - Resources: 30 Bricks, 30 Guns, 30 Fuel, 30 Iron (unlimited; use substitutes if needed)  
  - Workers: 38  
  - Tokens:  
    - 10 Shields  
    - 13 Ammo (wild resource)  
    - 9 Developments (yellow bulldozer)  
    - 20 Red Contact  
    - 20 Blue Contact  
    - 30 Grey Contact  
    - 7 Universal Contact  
    - 4 Multiplier Tokens  
- **Cards**:  
  - 88 Base Game Cards  
  - 50 New Era Cards (Expansion)  
  - 50 Winter Cards (Expansion)  
  - 12 Connection Cards (sorted by color)  
- **Player Materials**:

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the VP Board in the center.  
2. Form the General Supply with listed components.  
3. Shuffle the Base Game Cards with **one** expansion deck (New Era or Winter). Place face-down as the main deck; leave space for discard pile. Return unused expansion to box.  
4. Separate Connection Cards by color, shuffle each color deck individually, and place face-down near the main deck.  
5. Each player takes a Faction Board and places it in front of them. Place their Scoring Marker next to the "1" space on the VP Board.  
6. Deal 6 cards from the main deck to each player. Each player keeps 4 and discards 2.  
7. Randomly choose the First Player and give them the First Player Token.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of four phases:  
1. **Lookout Phase**  
2. **Production Phase**  
3. **Action Phase**  
4. **Clean-up Phase**  

Rounds continue until a player reaches 25 VP. Complete the current Action Phase, skip Clean-up, and proceed to Final Scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Phase 1: Lookout Phase  
1. Reveal the top card of each Connection Card deck and place it face-up on its deck.  
2. Draw (number of players + 1) cards and place them face-up in the play area.  
   - Starting with the First Player and proceeding clockwise, each player selects one card to add to their hand.  
   - Discard the remaining card.  
3. Repeat step 2: draw (players + 1) cards.  
   - This time, starting with the **last player** and proceeding **counter-clockwise**, each selects one card.  
   - Discard the last remaining card.  
- There is **no hand limit**.  
- If the main deck runs out, reshuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

#### Phase 2: Production Phase  
All players simultaneously collect goods from:  
- **Faction Board**: Receive goods shown on your board.  
- **Deals**: Receive goods from each active deal (cards placed under Faction Board).  
- **Production Locations**: Each Production Location (top row of your tableau) produces its goods.  
- **Open Production Locations**: Function as Production Locations and produce normally.  
- **Cards** drawn from deck, **VPs** added to marker, all other goods taken from supply.  
- If deck is empty, reshuffle discard pile.

#### Phase 3: Action Phase  
Players take turns clockwise, performing **one action at a time**. A player may pass at any time, ending their participation in the phase. Once passed, a player is immune to:  
- Razing of their Locations  
- Use of their Open Production Locations  
- Other interactions targeting their cards
