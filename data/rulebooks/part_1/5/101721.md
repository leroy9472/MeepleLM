### 1. Lore & Objective
- **Objective**: Defeat your opponent's Mage by reducing their Life to zero.
- **Lore**: In Apprentice Mode, players take on the role of powerful spellcasters—such as the Priestess, Warlock, Beastmaster, or Wizard—battling for supremacy in the realm of Etheria. Each Mage commands unique magical forces, from divine blessings to dark necromancy, but all share the same goal: total victory over their foe.

### 2. Components
- Mage cards (Priestess, Warlock, Beastmaster, Wizard, Druid, Necromancer)
- Spellbooks with spell cards (Creatures, Enchantments, Incantations, Attacks, Equipment)
- Mana tokens
- Action markers (face-up/face-down)
- Quickcast markers
- Condition markers (Burn, Cripple, Stun, Weak, Rot, etc.)
- Vine markers (Druid-specific)
- Initiative marker
- Game board (arena)
- Dice (attack dice and 12-sided effect die)

### 3. Setup
- **Arena**: Use a 2×3 zone grid (Apprentice Mode size).
- **Mage Placement**: Each Mage starts in opposite corners.
- **Starting Stats (Apprentice Mode)**:
  - **Life**: 24
  - **Channeling**: 10
  - **Armor**: 0
  - **Melee Attack Dice**: 3
  - **Starting Mana**: 10 in supply
- **Spellbooks**: Each player builds a spellbook using two Apprentice spellbooks (e.g., Beastmaster + Wizard). The Beastmaster is recommended for beginners.
- **Initiative**: Determine starting initiative (alternates each round).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds, each divided into two main stages:

#### Ready Stage
1. **Initiative Phase**: Pass initiative to the other player.
2. **Reset Phase**: Flip all action markers, quickcast markers, and ready markers to active (face-up).
3. **Channeling Phase**: Each Mage gains mana equal to their Channeling (10).
4. **Upkeep Phase**:
   - Pay upkeep costs (e.g., Upkeep +X).
   - Apply condition effects (e.g., Burn, Rot, Poison).
5. **Planning Phase**: Each Mage chooses up to 2 spells from their spellbook to cast this round.
6. **Deployment Phase**: Cast spells assigned to Spawnpoints (if any).

#### Action Stage
1. **First Quickcast Phase**: Each Mage may use their quickcast action (in initiative order).
2. **Action Phases**: Players alternate activating creatures (including Mages) to take actions:
   - Activate a creature (flip action marker, remove guard).
   - Take one of the following:
     - Move + Quick Action
     - Full Action (no move)
   - Repeat until all creatures have acted.
3. **Final Quickcast Phase**: Each Mage may use their quickcast action if not already used.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Actions**:
  - **Move Action**: Move one zone.
  - **Quick Action**: Guard, cast quick spell, make quick attack, or take a second move.
  - **Full Action**: Cast full spell or make full attack.
- **Quickcast Action**: Once per round, a Mage may cast one quick spell before or after any friendly Action Phase, or during Quickcast Phases.
- **Casting Spells**:
  - Pay mana cost and spend action (quick or full).
  - **Creatures**: Summoned into a zone, get face-down action marker.
  - **Enchantments**: Cast face-down; reveal later by paying reveal cost.
  - **Incantations & Attacks**: One-time effects; discarded after use.
  - **Equipment**: Attached to Mage; provides ongoing effects.
- **Attacks**:
  - **Melee Attack**: Targets same zone; triggers damage barriers and counterstrikes.
  - **Ranged Attack**: Targets within range and line of sight; ignores guards.
  - **Zone Attack**: Affects all in zone; Unavoidable.
- **Combat Sequence**:
  1. Declare Attack
  2. Avoid Attack (Defense roll)
  3. Roll Dice (attack and effect die)
  4. Apply Damage and Effects
  5. Additional Strikes (Doublestrike, Triplestrike)
  6. Damage Barrier (if triggered)
  7. Counterstrike (if applicable)
  8. Attack Ends
- **Conditions**:
  - Markers track ongoing effects (e.g., Burn, Stun, Cripple).
  - Some have removal costs (pay mana to remove).
  - Effects apply during Upkeep Phase (e.g., Burn rolls damage).
- **Hindering**: Moving into or out of a zone with enemy creatures ends movement unless Fast or Elusive.
- **Guarding**: As a quick action, a creature can guard—gain Counterstrike and protect the zone.
- **Line of Sight (LoS)**: Required for targeting; blocked by walls (not in Apprentice Mode).
- **Destruction**: When damage ≥ Life, object is destroyed and placed in discard pile.
- **Obliterate**: Destroy and remove from game; prevents resurrection effects.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: Reduce opponent's Mage to 0 Life.
- **Lose Condition**: Your Mage is destroyed.
- **No Scoring System**: Game ends immediately when one Mage is defeated.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a Mage cast more than 2 spells per round?**  
  No, only 2 spells can be planned per round unless using quickcast or special abilities.
- **Can you guard with a creature that has no melee attack?**  
  Yes, guarding only requires the ability to take a quick action.
- **Does a Mage have a Defense?**  
  No, Mages cannot use Defenses against attacks.
- **Can you use quickcast during a creature’s Action Phase?**  
  Yes—before or after any friendly Action Phase.
- **What happens if a creature has both Fast and Slow?**  
  The traits cancel each other out; creature acts normally.
- **Can you target a creature with Stuck?**  
  Yes, but it cannot move. Stuck only restricts movement and actions.
- **Do Burn markers persist after damage kills a creature?**  
  No—burn is removed when the creature is destroyed.
