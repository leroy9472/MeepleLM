# 1. Lore & Objective

Imperial Struggle is a two-player game set between 1697 and 1789, depicting the rivalry between France and Britain. Players compete across economic, diplomatic, and military domains during six Peace Turns and four Wars: the War of the Spanish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, and the American War of Independence. Victory is achieved through control of regions, commodities, and strategic assets, with the ultimate goal of surpassing the opponent in Victory Points (VP).

The game ends immediately if a player achieves an automatic victory, or after Turn 6 via Final Scoring. France wins if VP ≥ 30; Britain wins if VP ≤ 0. If no automatic victory occurs, the winner is determined by Final Scoring.

# 5. Core Mechanics

## Action Points (AP)
Three types:
- **Economic Action Points (C)** – shift Markets  
- **Diplomatic Action Points (✔)** – shift Political spaces, draw Event cards  
- **Military Action Points (O)** – build/repair Forts, deploy Squadrons, buy Bonus War Tiles, remove Conflict markers

AP are granted by Investment Tiles (Major and Minor Actions) and Event cards.

## Investment Tiles
Each tile provides:
- One Major Action (2–4 AP)
- One Minor Action (2 AP of different type)
- Optional Event play (cross symbol)
- Optional Military Upgrade (cycle symbol)

Minor Action Restrictions:
- Only one expenditure per Minor Action
- Cannot remove opposing flags or Squadrons unless the space has a Conflict marker

## Action Round Sequence
1. Select an Investment Tile
2. Optionally play an Event card (if tile allows)
3. Resolve tile actions (Major, Minor, Military Upgrade) in any order

## Event Cards
- Pro-British (top) and pro-French (bottom) versions
- May only play version matching your nation
- Bonus Condition must be met at time of play to receive bonus effect
- Event must be fully resolved before tile actions
- Played cards are removed from the game

## Ministry Cards
- Selected at start of each Era; may replace one in the second turn
- Keywords (Finance, Mercantilism, Governance, Style, Scholarship) trigger Event bonuses
- Abilities may be used once per turn or at end of turn

## Advantages
- Gain control by flagging all spaces connected to a pentagon
- May use once per Peace Turn; cannot be used in the same Action Round it is gained
- Max 2 per Action Round, one per Region
- Cannot be used if any connected space has a Conflict marker

## Debt and Treaty Points
- **Debt**: Can be taken to gain 1 AP per point; cannot exceed Debt Limit
- If forced to take Debt over Limit, opponent gains 1 VP per excess
- Passing allows reduction of Debt by up to 2
- **Treaty Points (TRP)**: Wild AP; excess over 4 are lost at end of each Peace Turn

## Connection and Isolation
- **Market Shift Requirement**: Must be connected to a Territory, Fort, Naval space, or friendly Market (not Isolated, no Conflict)
- **Isolated Market**: Flagged Market that cannot trace a path via friendly, conflict-free Markets to a Territory, Fort, or Naval space at start of Action Round
- Isolated Markets cost 1 to shift
- Building a Fort or deploying a Squadron in a connected Market breaks Isolation

## Protected Spaces
- A flagged Market connected to a friendly Squadron or undamaged Fort is Protected
- Shifting a Protected Market costs +1
- Removing a Conflict marker from a Protected Market costs 1 O

# 6. Scoring & End Game

## Automatic Victory Conditions
- After any Scoring Phase: one player wins all 4 Regional Awards and all 3 Global Demand Awards
- VP ≤ 0: Britain wins
- VP ≥ 30: France wins
- After any War: one player wins all theaters by maximum possible margin

## Scoring Phase (Peace Turns)
1. **Regional Scoring**: For each Region, player with more flags and Squadrons wins the Award. Ties: no award. Red number (e.g., "2") requires winning by that margin.
2. **Prestige Scoring**: In Europe, player with more Prestige spaces (green borders) gains 2 VP.
3. **Global Demand Scoring**: For each of 3 drawn commodities, player with more Markets gains reward from Global Demand Table (by Era).

## Final Scoring (Turn 6)
If no automatic victory:
- **Prestige**: 2 VP to player with more Prestige spaces (include USA spaces if present)
- **Available Debt**: 1 VP per 2-point difference (max 4 VP)
- **Commodities**: 1 VP per commodity with majority of Markets
- **Conquered Territories**: 2 VP per friendly flag in opponent’s starting Territory

Final VP determines winner:
- VP ≥ 16: France wins
- VP ≤ 14: Britain wins
- VP = 15: player with more Available Debt wins; if tied, Britain wins
