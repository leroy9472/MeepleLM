### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Deckbuilding Phase
- **Duration**: 20 minutes total, split into three intervals:
  1. 7 minutes (after initial setup)
  2. 7 minutes (after dealing 6 more cards and revealing Type Metagame)
  3. 6 minutes (no new selling allowed)
- **Setup Steps**:
  1. Flip player boards to Deckbuilding side.
  2. Combine all personal cards into the Binder.
  3. Deal 6 Store cards face-down to each player (cannot look until timer starts).
  4. Place top 9 Store cards face-down in Store Area (10 visible including top card).
  5. Reveal a new Elemental Metagame Card.
  6. Start 7-minute timer.

- **Actions (during timer)**:
  - **Build Your Deck**: Select up to 8 Singles, 1 Deck Box, and 2 Accessories. No duplicates allowed.
  - **Make a Collection**: Create a set of 2–8 cards sharing at least one Element or Type, all with different Star Ratings. Only one collection per phase (two in 2-player Duel Mode).
  - **Buy from Store**: Pay the cost (top-right number) to take any face-down Store card. Replace with top card from Store Deck.
  - **Fuse for Promo**: Spend 5/7/9 cards to get Bronze/Silver/Gold Promo. Place a Sell Marker on the Promo pile (only one fusion per type per phase).
  - **Sell to Aftermarket**: Place a card and a Sell Marker in Aftermarket; receive M$ equal to its Star Rating. Cannot resell or remove.
  - **Buy from Aftermarket**: Pay Star Rating in M$ to buy a card; return Sell Marker to owner.
  - **Trade with Players**: Equal-value trades (Star Ratings + M$). Can include Friendship Cards for favors.

- **End of Phase Cleanup**:
  1. Turn in collections (score VP, cards removed from game).
  2. Move non-deck cards to Binder.
  3. Retrieve Sell Markers.
  4. Discard Store and Aftermarket cards to Store Discard.

#### Tournament Phase
- **Setup**:
  1. Flip boards to Tournament side.
  2. Hold deck in hand; set Binder aside.
  3. Place Deck Box and Accessories on Tournament Board.
  4. Set RP to zero.
  5. First player: highest previous placement (or last to open pack if first round).

- **On Your Turn**:
  - **Play a Single (Required)**: Play one card to the leftmost empty slot in your Tableau.
  - **Use an Action (Optional)**: Use one "Action:" effect, then flip the card face-down. Can be done before or after playing a card.

- **Card Effects**:
  - **Play**: Triggers immediately upon playing.
  - **Next**: Triggers on your next played card.
  - **Flip**: Triggers when card is flipped face-down.
  - **Ongoing**: Active while face-up.
  - **Top**: Active only if card is rightmost face-up card.
  - **Score**: Triggers at end of tournament.
  - **Reaction**: Optional; triggers when condition is met, then flip card.

- **Priority Order**: Top > Ongoing > Play > Next > Score. Reactions and Flips resolve immediately after triggering.

- **Top Card**: Rightmost face-up card in Tableau. Used for clashes and Top effects.

- **Clashing**:
  - Triggered by card effects.
  - Each participant reveals top Store card; add its Star Rating to their Top Card’s Star Rating.
  - Highest total wins; tie means no winner.
  - Revealed Store cards go to Aftermarket (if full, discard all to Store Discard first).

- **End of Tournament**:
  1. Activate Score effects: Tableau (left to right), Deck Box, Accessories, Metagame.
  2. Award VP based on RP (Tournament VP Chart).
  3. Resolve ties: sum VP for tied ranks, divide evenly (round down).
  4. Distribute Prize Support: Bronze Promo (Round 1), Silver Promo (Round 2).
  5. In normal mode: return cards to Binder, reset for next Deckbuilding.
  6. In final round: proceed to final scoring.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Final VP Sources**:
1. **Tournament VPs**: From each round’s placement.
2. **Collection VPs**: From completed collections each round.
3. **Wealth**: 1 VP per 4 Millennium Dollars (round down).
4. **Friendship Cards**: VP from cards received (max 6 VP per player).

**Tiebreaker**:

**Special Cases**:
- **Infinite Loops**: Player is removed from tournament but scores as if they won 1st place. Cards returned to box; gain M$ equal to sell value (except in final round).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Face-Down Cards**: No Star Rating, Element, Type, or text. Count as cards for positional effects.
- **Flipping**: Cards cannot be flipped back up. "Flip" always means turn face-down.
- **Targets**: Must choose legal target if possible. Cannot target face-down cards unless specified.
- **Effect Resolution**: Complete current effect before resolving triggered effects (e.g., Play effect resolves before Flip effect from being flipped).
- **Simultaneous Effects**: Resolve in priority order: Top > Ongoing > Play > Next > Score.
- **Revealing**: Show card, then return to original state (e.g., hand or face-down slot).
- **"This"**: Refers to the card the effect is on.
- **Store Depletion**: Shuffle Store Discard to form new Store Deck.
- **Aftermarket Limit**: 12 cards during Tournament; overflow clears all to Store Discard.
- **Illegal Deck**: Randomly remove cards until within limits (8 Singles, 1 Deck Box, 2 Accessories).
