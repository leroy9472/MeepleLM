5. (Rat) Draw new Rat card, place over old one.
6. (Ancient Beasts) Draw and reveal new Relic card, place over old one.

**Fall**:

   - Active player chooses order to activate locations.
   - Resolve locations in tea order.

   - Archers, Bombers, Crossbowmen shoot: left to right, tea order. Each places one wound on any horde in their section.
   - Check for defeated hordes.
2. **Assault Phase**:
   - For each wall section (left to right):
     - Compare total offensive power of hordes vs. wall defense (wall level + 2 per barricade).
     - If offensive > defense, wall is breached.
     - (Special) If Ladder is in first row, wall is automatically breached.
   - **Breach Effects**:
     - Each player gains 1 shame token for each horde card in the section they have no soldier on.
     - All archers, bombers, crossbowmen on wall are killed.
     - (Black Powder, if Ladder in first row) Soldiers in rest zones killed, war machines destroyed.
     - Kill soldiers on hordes per lethality; may save by paying 2 Chi.
   - Discard all barricades.
   - (Black Powder) Score for soldiers in towers: 2 honor per unbreached adjacent wall, gain shame per breached.
   - (Black Powder) If Ram in first row or Trebuchet in third row, destroy top wall section(s).
3. **End Game Check**: If any end condition is met, proceed to scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Tea Order**: Determines turn order in multiple-player actions. Highest on tea stack acts first.
- **Clerk Placement**: Players place clerks on locations during command card resolution. Regular locations (red) require all spots filled to activate. Special locations (green) activate with any clerk.
- **Advanced Activation**: Some cards allow activating locations without filling them; no shame gained if alone.
- **Resource Management**: Gain resources from production locations with overseers. Donate to warehouse for honor.
- **Soldier Recruitment**: In Barracks, pay cost to recruit soldier. May attack immediately or place in rest zone.
- **Wall Building**: In Builders' Encampment, pay cost (warehouse first) to build wall level (gain honor equal to cost) or barricade (2 honor).
- **Horde Defeat**: When all vital spots covered:
  - All players with soldiers on horde gain 2 honor.
  - All players gain 2 honor per archer in that wall section.
  - Player with most soldiers on vital spots claims card (tea order tiebreak).
  - Kill soldiers per lethality; may save by paying 2 Chi.
  - Survivors go to rest zone.
  - Slide remaining hordes forward.
- **Breach**: When wall defense < horde offense:
  - Gain shame for each horde card you're not on.
  - Kill soldiers on hordes and archers on wall.
  - (Black Powder) Additional effects for siege engines.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End Game Conditions** (trigger immediately):
- All 3 walls built to maximum (2 walls in 3-player).
- Shame token pool empty.
- Time token on last slot.
- (Genghis Khan) Genghis Khan defeated (all vital spots covered).

**Final Scoring**:
- Lose 5 honor for each soldier with a shame token under it.
- Gain honor for each claimed horde card without shame token on it.
- Gain honor from Artifact cards (end-game goals).
- Highest honor wins. Tie: highest on tea track wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Shame Tokens**: Must be placed under a soldier or on a horde card. If unable, lose 5 honor. If pool empty, lose 5 honor instead.
- **Tiebreakers**: Tea order breaks all ties (e.g., claiming hordes, moving Rat).
- **Soldier Saving**: Pay 2 Chi to save a soldier from death; goes to rest zone.
- **War Machines**: Built in Builders' Encampment. May shoot when built, when placing spearman in tower, or when defeating horde and claiming card.
- **Genghis Khan**: Can be attacked when defeating any horde. Cover all vital spots on his card and two skill cards to defeat him.
- **Rat Movement**: Must move to different location; cannot stay. Player meeting condition moves it; tie to higher tea.
- **Resource Use**: When building, use warehouse resources first, then personal supply.
