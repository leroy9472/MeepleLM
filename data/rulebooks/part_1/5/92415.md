## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Skull is a game of bluffing, strategy, and nerve. Players use coasters marked with either a flower or a skull, attempting to outwit opponents by hiding their own skulls while guessing where others may have hidden theirs.  

**Objective:** Be the first player to successfully complete two challenges (flip over your mat twice) or be the last player remaining.

### 2. Components  
- Each player receives:  
  - 4 coasters (each with one side showing a flower, the other a skull)  
  - 1 player mat (double-sided: skull side and flower side)  
- 1 game box (used to discard lost coasters)  

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player takes 4 coasters and a matching-colored/style mat.  
2. Randomly choose the starting player.  
3. Each player:  
   - Places all 4 coasters face-down into their hand (so others cannot see the back: flower or skull).  
   - Places their mat in front of them with the **skull side up**.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A game of Skull is played over multiple rounds. Each round ends when a challenge is attempted and resolved. The game ends when one player has flipped their mat to the flower side twice (winning the game) or only one player remains (others eliminated).

**Round Structure:**  
1. **Simultaneous Placement Phase**:  
   - All players simultaneously place **one coaster** face-down on their mat.  
   - Players may bluff, lie, or tell the truth about what they placed (flower or skull), but **must not reveal** the coaster.

2. **Turn-Based Placement or Challenge Phase**:  
   - Starting with the current first player and proceeding clockwise, each player must:  
     - Place another coaster face-down **on top of their existing stack**, OR  
     - **Start a challenge** (bidding phase begins).  
   - Players with **no coasters left in hand must start a challenge**.  
   - Players may stack multiple coasters over several turns.

3. **Challenge/Bidding Phase**:  
   - A player announces they are starting a challenge and makes a bid (minimum 1).  
   - The bid is the number of coasters they claim they can flip without revealing a skull.  
   - The maximum bid is the total number of coasters currently on all players’ mats.  
   - Bidding proceeds clockwise: each player either:  
     - **Increases the bid** (by any amount greater than the current bid), or  
     - **Passes** (and is out of the challenge).  
   - Once all but one player have passed, the last remaining bidder **must attempt the challenge**.

4. **Attempting the Challenge**:  
   - The challenger must flip exactly **their bid number** of coasters, **without revealing a skull**.  
   - Rules for flipping:  
     - Must start with **their own coasters**, flipping from the top of their stack.  
     - After flipping all of their own coasters (if needed), they choose **any other player’s stack** and flip the **top coaster only**.  
     - They may choose different players’ stacks freely after each flip.  
     - If a **skull is revealed**, the challenge **fails immediately**.  
     - If the challenger completes the bid without revealing a skull, they **succeed**.

5. **Resolving the Challenge**:  
   - **Success**:  
     - The challenger flips their mat to the **flower side** (first success).  
     - If this is their **second successful challenge**, they **win the game**.  
     - Otherwise, a new round begins.  
   - **Failure**:  
     - The challenge stops immediately when a skull is revealed.  
     - The challenger **loses one coaster** (see below).  
     - No other coasters are flipped.  
     - Players may choose to reveal their coasters, but are not required to.

6. **Coaster Loss (After Failed Challenge)**:  
   - If the revealed skull belonged to the **challenger**, they **choose secretly** which of their remaining coasters to discard (without showing).  
   - If the skull belonged to **another player**, that player **randomly selects one** of the challenger’s coasters (without looking) and discards it to the box.

7. **Starting a New Round**:  
   - All players retrieve their remaining coasters into their hands.  
   - The **next first player** is determined as follows:  
     - If the challenger **succeeded**, they become the new first player.  
     - If the challenger **failed but was not eliminated**, they become the new first player.  
     - If the challenger was **eliminated**, the player whose **skull caused the elimination** becomes the first player.  
     - If the challenger revealed **their own skull**, they **choose** the next first player.

8. **Elimination**:  
   - A player is **eliminated** when they have **no coasters left**.  
   - Eliminated players take no further part in the game.  
   - The game continues until one player wins by succeeding at two challenges or is the last player remaining.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Bluffing & Hidden Information**: Players hide whether their coasters are flowers or skulls.  
- **Stacking**: Players build a stack of coasters face-down; only the top coaster can be flipped during a challenge.  
- **Bidding**: Players bid competitively; must increase or pass. Last bidder attempts the challenge.  
- **Challenge Attempt**: Must flip own coasters first, then any others’ top coasters, up to bid number.  
- **Coaster Loss**: After failure, lose one coaster—either self-selected (if own skull) or randomly chosen by opponent (if opponent’s skull).

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is no traditional scoring. Victory is achieved by:  
  1. Successfully completing **two challenges** (flipping your mat twice), OR  
  2. Being the **last player remaining** (all others eliminated).  
- The game ends **immediately** when either condition is met.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I bid 0?**  
  No. Minimum bid is 1.  
- **Can I bid more than the total number of coasters on mats?**  
  No. Maximum bid is the total number of coasters currently on all mats.  
- **Can I flip a coaster from the middle of a stack?**  
  No. Only the **top coaster** of any stack can be flipped.  
- **What if I have no coasters in hand?**  
  You **must start a challenge** on your turn.  
- **Can I pass during the bidding even if I still have coasters?**  
  Yes. Passing removes you from the current challenge only.  
- **Do players reveal coasters after a failed challenge?**  
  No. Coasters remain face-down unless the owner chooses to reveal.  
- **What happens if multiple players are eliminated?**  
  The game continues until one player remains or someone wins by two successes.  
- **Can I win by elimination even if I’ve never succeeded a challenge?**  
  Yes. Last player standing wins, regardless of challenge successes.
