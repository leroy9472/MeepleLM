## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are the mayor of a tiny town hidden in the forest, built by woodland creatures. Resources are scarce, and space is limited. Your goal is to construct a prosperous town on a 4x4 grid by placing resource cubes and converting them into buildings that score Victory Points (VP).  

The game ends when all players complete their towns. Final scoring includes VP from buildings, penalties for empty squares (-1 VP each), and special monument abilities. The player with the most VP wins.  

### 2. Components  
- 6 player boards (4x4 grids)  
- 90 wooden resource cubes in 5 types:  
  - WOOD (brown)  
  - WHEAT (yellow)  
  - BRICK (red)  
  - GLASS (blue)  
  - STONE (gray)  
- 126 wooden buildings in 7 types (blue, red, gray, orange, green, yellow, black)  
- 25 Building cards (1 Cottage + 24 others)  
- 15 Monument cards  
- 15 Resource cards (used only in variants)  
- 6 wooden monuments  
- 1 Master Builder hammer  
- 1 scorepad  

### 3. Setup  
1. Give each player a 4x4 player board.  
2. Leave Resource cards in the box (unless playing Town Hall or Solo variant).  
3. Place the **Cottage** Building card face-up in the center.  
4. Sort remaining Building cards into 6 piles by symbol on the back.  
5. Shuffle each pile and draw 1 card from each, placing them face-up next to the Cottage.  
   - Recommended first game: Cottage, Chapel, Farm, Tavern, Well, Theater, Factory.  
6. Return unused Building cards to the box.  
7. Place resource cubes and buildings (excluding monuments) in a shared supply.  
8. Determine starting player: the player who most recently built something in real life. Give them the Master Builder hammer.  
9. Shuffle Monument cards and deal 2 face-down to each player.  
10. Each player chooses 1 Monument card to keep (secret), discards the other.  
11. Give each player the matching wooden monument piece; return extras to the box.  
12. Optional: Play without monuments for first game.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in 4 steps:  
1. **Name Resource**: The Master Builder calls one of the 5 resource types.  
2. **Place Resource**: All players simultaneously take a cube of that type and place it in an empty square on their board.  
   - Must place unless no space remains.  
   - Resources cannot be moved once placed.  
3. **Construct Buildings**: Players may simultaneously construct any buildings for which they have the required resource layout.  
   - Announce constructions.  
   - Remove resources, return to supply.  
   - Place matching wooden building in one of the vacated squares.  
4. **Pass Master Builder Token**: The hammer passes clockwise. The new Master Builder waits for all players to finish before starting the next round.  

A player may construct multiple buildings in one round, but each resource can only be used for one building. Buildings do not need to be built immediately.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Resource Placement  
- Only 1 resource or building per square.  
- Resources can only be removed by building.  
- Once placed, resources are fixed.  

#### Building Construction  
- Layouts may be rotated or mirrored.  
- To construct:  
  1. Remove required resources in correct shape.  
  2. Take matching building from supply.  
  3. Place it in one of the vacated squares.  
- Any player can build any displayed building (except other players’ monuments).  
- Building cards remain in display and are not replaced.  
- Cannot construct before placing the resource in the same round.  

#### Monuments  
- Only the player who holds the card can construct it.  
- May be built once, in any round.  
- Upon construction:  
  - Read card aloud.  
  - Place card face-up.  
  - Resolve immediate effects (e.g., abilities).  
- Scoring occurs at game end.  
- Monuments are not in general supply.  

#### Cavern Rule (Optional)  
- Players may set aside up to 2 resources named by others (not on the board).  
- Can place them later on empty squares.  
- No scoring impact.  

#### Feeding Cottages  
- Cottages ( ) must be "fed" by red buildings (e.g., Farms) to score 3 VP.  
- Unfed Cottages score 0 VP.  
- Other buildings (e.g., Wells) may score based on adjacent Cottages, regardless of feeding.  

#### Completing Your Town  
- A player’s town is complete when they cannot (or choose not to) place or build further.  
- That player exits the game and begins scoring.  
- They no longer act as Master Builder.  
- Remaining players continue.  
- If only one player remains, they continue naming resources until their town is complete.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends when all players have completed their towns.  

**Final Steps**:  
1. Remove all remaining resource cubes (except those stored on Warehouses).  
2. Score:  
   - Each building: based on its scoring rule.  
   - Each empty square: -1 VP.  
   - Monuments: resolve end-game scoring.  
   - Coins (if Fortune expansion): 1 VP each.  

**Tiebreakers (in order)**:  
1. Fewest turns as Master Builder.  
2. Fewest empty squares.  
3. Most Cottages.  
4. Shared victory.  

**Additional Rules**:  
- Resources and buildings are unlimited (use substitutes if needed).  
- "Adjacent" means orthogonally (up/down/left/right), not diagonal.  
- Negative scores are possible.  
- Red buildings (e.g., Farms) never score VP on their own.
