## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
The objective of the Robot Player is to enable solo or cooperative play in Star Wars: Armada. It provides structured decision-making guidelines for controlling a fleet without requiring full human-like AI. The Robot simulates intelligent behavior by following best practices approximately 70% of the time and introducing random decisions 30% of the time (adjustable to 60%/40% for more randomness). It does not replace a human opponent entirely but reduces self-second-guessing during solo play.

### 2. Components
- 10-sided die (D10)
- Coin (for binary decisions)
- Ship cards (optional for tracking)
- Dry-erase markers (if using sleeved cards)

### 3. Setup
#### Standard Obstacle Placement
- Divide setup area into 4 horizontal sections (Far Left, Near Left, Near Right, Far Right Flank) and 3 vertical sections (Robot edge, center, Human edge).
- Roll D10:
  - Horizontal: 1–3 Far Left, 4–5 Near Left, 6–7 Near Right, 8–10 Far Right
  - Vertical: 1–3 Robot edge (3–5 range), 4–7 Center, 8–10 Human edge (3–5 range)
- Place obstacle at least distance 1 from others; use largest remaining obstacle.

#### Ship Deployment
- Roll to select ship order:
  - 1–3: 2 Squadrons
  - 4–5: Smallest Ship
  - 6–7: Largest Non-Flagship
  - 8–9: Flagship
  - 10: Objective Ship
- First ship placement: roll horizontal flank as above.
- Subsequent ships: 1–7 same section as previous, 8–10 new section (re-roll).
- Place ships based on Movement Profile:
  - Forward-facer: Distance 2–3, face target
  - Broadsider/Flanker: Distance 2–3, 45° angle
  - Escorter: Distance 1–2 behind friendly target
  - Runner: Distance 1–2, face open board
- Ships start at speed 2 unless modified by scenario.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Determine Ship Activation Order** (per Robot turn):
   - 1–7: Apply list top-down
     - Best Attack (significant damage potential)
     - Most Threatened (heavily damaged or under fire)
     - Objective Ship
     - Pass Token (delay for tactical advantage)
     - Smallest to Largest by hull points
   - 8–10: Roll randomly among applicable ships

2. **Determine Command Type**:
   - Vanilla: 1–3 NAVIGATE, 4–5 CONCENTRATE FIRE, 6–7 SQUADRON, 8–10 ENGINEERING
   - Mover: 1–7 NAVIGATE, 8–10 ENGINEERING
   - Carrier: 1–6 SQUADRON, 7–8 NAVIGATE, 9–10 ENGINEERING
   - Attacker: 1–5 NAVIGATE, 6–8 CONCENTRATE FIRE, 9–10 ENGINEERING

3. **Execute Commands**:
   - **Navigation**: Accelerate if target activated; decelerate if not
   - **Engineering**: Repair face-up damage → face-down → shields (most damaged first)
   - **Squadron**: Activate max squadrons starting with closest
   - **Concentrate Fire**: Add die (black → blue → red) or reroll (blank black → blank red → accuracy blue)
   - **Tokens**: Spend if beneficial (e.g., activate squadron, repair shield)

4. **Attack**:
   - Attack priority (1–7 top-down, 8–10 random):
     - Target Ship
     - Closest Ship
     - Most Damaged
     - Least Damaged
     - Squadrons
   - Use largest attack first; target weakest hull zone
   - Prioritize hull zones matching enemy movement profile if equal

5. **Move**:
   - Follow Movement Guideline Priorities:
     1. Stay on board
     2. Avoid ramming friendly ships
     3. Double arc enemy
     4. Avoid obstacles
     5. Ram enemy (1–7 unless ≤2 HP remaining; always if destroys enemy)

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Ship Characteristics
Each ship must have assigned:
- **Preferred Range**: Long, Medium, or Short
- **Target Selection** (roll D10):
  - 1–7: Apply list top-down
    - Objective Ship
    - Flagship
    - Largest non-Flagship
    - Largest Carrier
    - Most Damaged (or closest if none)
    - Squadrons
  - 8–10: Re-roll
- **Movement Profile**:
  - Forward-facer: Nose toward target
  - Broadsider: Side toward target
  - Flanker: Curve to avoid enemy's strong side
  - Escorter: Stay within range 3 of friendly target
  - Runner: Stay away from enemies (near destruction: Small=1HP, Medium=2HP, Large=3HP)

#### Command Type Assignment
Assign based on fleet composition:
- Vanilla: Balanced use
- Mover: Speed-focused
- Carrier: Squadron-heavy
- Attacker: Damage-focused

#### Defense Token Usage
Spend tokens to minimize damage:
- Scatter: Only if evade wouldn't suffice
- Evade:
  - Long: Cancel worst die
  - Medium/Short: Reroll worst die
- Brace: Reduce 3+ damage; use red only to avoid destruction
- Redirect: Spread to avoid hull damage
- Salvo: Use on ships; red only in Squadron Phase Round 6

#### Obstruction
When obstructed, remove die in order: Red → Blue → Black

#### Upgrades
- Use at first opportunity
- Do not waste (e.g., pass tokens to ships without them)
- For conditional upgrades (e.g., turn-based), flip coin or choose

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends after 6 rounds or when all ships of one player are destroyed
- Score = Total fleet cost of destroyed enemy ships + victory tokens × objective value
- Tie: Second player wins
- Victory tokens scored via objectives (e.g., objective ship destruction, token collection)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Random Decisions**: Use coin flip or D10 (1–5 vs 6–10) when choices are equal
- **Overlapped Squadrons**:
  - Human ship overlaps: Robot places on hull zone farthest from its forces
  - Robot ship overlaps: Human chooses placement
- **Raid Tokens**: Always spend matching command token to cancel; spend dial if no tokens
- **Near Destruction**: Triggers Runner profile
- **Salvo Token**: Only use during Squadron Phase Round 6 if red; otherwise prefer on ships
- **Human Judgment**: When rules allow discretion, make best choice for Robot; if unclear, flip coin
