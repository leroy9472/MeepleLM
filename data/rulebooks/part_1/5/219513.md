## Barenpark — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are park architects designing bear parks by strategically placing enclosures, animal houses, and green areas. The goal is to score the most points by efficiently filling park areas, completing achievements, and claiming valuable bear statues.

### 2. Components  
- 16 Park Areas (4 with Entrances, 12 without)  
- 52 Green Areas:  
  - 16 Food Streets  
  - 10 Toilets  
  - 10 Playgrounds  
  - 16 Rivers  
- 28 Animal Houses (values 1–7):  
  - 7 Polar Bear Houses  
  - 7 Gobi Bear Houses  
  - 7 Koala Houses  
  - 7 Panda Houses  
- 12 Enclosures (values 6–8):  
  - 3 Panda Enclosures  
  - 3 Polar Bear Enclosures  
  - 3 Gobi Bear Enclosures  
  - 3 Koala Enclosures  
- 16 Bear Statues (numbered 1–16)  
- 30 Achievement Tiles (10 types, 3 per type)  
- 1 Supply Board (organizes Green Areas, Animal Houses, Enclosures)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the Supply Board in the center.  
2. Stock Green Areas:  
   - Use all 10 Toilets and 10 Playgrounds.  
   - Use 4 × number of players of Food Streets and Rivers (e.g., 8 each for 2 players, 12 for 3, 16 for 4).  
3. Stock Animal Houses:  
   - 2 players: Use values 6, 4, 2 (one of each shape)  
   - 3 players: Use values 6, 5, 4, 3, 2  
   - 4 players: Use all values (7–1)  
   - Stack each shape’s tiles with highest on top.  
4. Place all 12 Enclosures on the Supply Board (use all regardless of player count).  
5. Lay out Bear Statues in numerical order:  
   - 2 players: Use even numbers only (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16)  
   - 3 players: Use 3–14  
   - 4 players: Use all (1–16)  
6. Shuffle the 12 Park Areas without entrances and form two face-up stacks of 6.  
7. Give each player a random Park Area with entrance; place it with entrance closest to them and icons correctly oriented.  
8. Determine starting player (e.g., last to visit a zoo). Distribute starting tiles:  
   - P1: Toilet  
   - P2: Playground  
   - P3: Playground (in 4P), Food Street (in 3P)  
   - P4: Food Street  
   Place in personal supply.  
9. Variant: Randomly select 3 of 10 Achievement types. Stack each type with highest value on top. In 2-player games, remove the lowest-value tile from each stack.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, perform these steps in order:  
**A. Place a Tile**  
- Place exactly one tile from your supply into your park.  
- Placement rules:  
  - Must fit within park boundaries (may span multiple Park Areas).  
  - Cannot hang over edge or overlap another tile.  
  - Cannot cover a Pit (except in expert Pit Variant on final turn).  
  - May rotate or flip tile.  
  - Must be orthogonally adjacent to an existing tile or Bear Statue (exception: first tile may be placed anywhere valid).  
- If unable to place, skip to **Passing**.

**B. Evaluate Icons**  
For each icon covered by the placed tile, resolve in any order:  
- **Green Wheelbarrow**: Take any Green Area (Toilet, Playground, Food Street, River) into your supply.  
- **White Cement Truck**: Take the top Animal House of your choice, OR take a Green Area instead.  
- **Orange Excavator**: Take any Enclosure, OR take an Animal House or Green Area instead.  
- **Construction Crew**: Take the top Park Area from either stack.  
  - Place it orthogonally adjacent to an existing Park Area (edges fully aligned).  
  - Must be correctly oriented (icons face you).  
  - Cannot place below entrance (closer to you than entrance).  
  - Max 4 Park Areas per player (no 5th board allowed).  
  - If one stack is empty, take from the other.

**C. Place a Bear Statue**  
- If a Park Area (with or without entrance) is fully covered (except Pit), take the highest-numbered Bear Statue available and place it on the Pit.  
- If multiple Park Areas are completed this turn, place a Bear Statue on each.

**D. Claim an Achievement (Variant)**  
- If you meet the requirement of any available Achievement, take the top tile from its stack.  
- You may claim multiple types in one turn, but only one tile per type (no duplicates).  
- Achievements remain available until claimed.

**Passing**  
- If you cannot place a tile, you must pass.  
- Take one free Green Area of your choice into your supply.  
- Your turn ends immediately.  
- You may not pass if you can legally place a tile.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Tile Placement**: Strategic tiling with adjacency and orientation rules.  
- **Icon Harvesting**: Gain new tiles by covering icons; Excavator offers most flexibility.  
- **Park Expansion**: Add new Park Areas via Construction Crew icons.  
- **Bear Statues**: Awarded for completing Park Areas; higher numbers are better.  
- **Achievements**: Optional goal-based scoring (3 selected per game).  
- **Supply Management**: No limit on tiles in supply; passing grants a free Green Area.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger**:  
- When a player completes their 4th Park Area (covers all non-Pit spaces), each other player takes one final turn. Then the game ends.  
- Alternative end: If no legal moves remain and no one completed 4 areas, game ends immediately.

**Final Scoring**:  
- Add points from all tiles in your park:  
  - Animal Houses  
  - Enclosures  
  - Green Areas  
  - Bear Statues  
- Add points from any Achievements claimed.  
- **Winner**: Highest total wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**:  
  1. Most points in unplaced tiles (supply).  
  2. If still tied, all tied players win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a tile that only covers a Pit?** No. Tiles may not cover Pits at any time (except expert variant on final turn).  
- **Can I place a Park Area diagonally?** No. Must be orthogonally adjacent with full edge alignment.  
- **Can I take a lower-value Animal House?** No. You take the top (highest-value) tile unless the pile is empty.  
- **Do Bear Statues count for adjacency?** Yes. They count as tiles for adjacency when placing new tiles.  
- **Can I claim an Achievement I completed earlier but didn’t claim?** Yes, as long as you meet the condition at the time of your turn.  
- **What if both Park Area stacks are empty?** You cannot gain a new Park Area via Construction Crew.  
- **Can I rotate a Park Area when placing it?** No. Must be placed with correct orientation (icons facing you).
