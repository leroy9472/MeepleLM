## DIXIT — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Dixit is a creative storytelling and card-matching game where players attempt to interpret abstract imagery through imaginative clues. The objective is to score points by either leading others to guess your card (without being too obvious) or correctly identifying the storyteller’s card.

2. Components  
- A deck of illustrated cards (typically 84)  
- Voting cards or tokens for each player (number varies with player count)  
- Score tokens or a score track (optional)  
- Player tokens or voting sliders (if using portable scoretrack or voting cards)

3. Setup  
- Each player draws 6 cards from the deck (7 cards in a 3-player game).  
- Choose a starting player (the first storyteller).  
- Place the deck and voting tools within reach.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows these steps:  
1. **Storyteller Chooses Clue**: The active player (storyteller) selects one card from their hand and gives a clue (word, phrase, sound, or association) that relates to it.  
2. **Other Players Submit Cards**: Each other player selects one card from their hand that matches the clue in some way and submits it face-down.  
3. **Shuffle and Reveal**: The storyteller shuffles all submitted cards (including their own) and places them face-up in random order.  
4. **Voting**: All other players secretly vote for the card they believe is the storyteller’s using tokens or voting tools.  
5. **Scoring**:  
   - Reveal votes and determine which card received the most (or any) votes.  
   - Score points based on who found the correct card.  
6. **Draw Back**: All players draw cards to restore their hand to 6 (or 7 in 3-player).  
7. **Next Round**: Play passes clockwise; new player becomes storyteller.

3-Player Variant Rule:  
- Each non-storyteller plays **2 cards** during submission.  
- Hand size is **7 cards**.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Clue-Giving**: The storyteller must give a clue that is neither too obvious nor too obscure.  
- **Card Submission**: Other players contribute cards that plausibly fit the clue.  
- **Blind Voting**: Players vote without knowing others’ choices.  
- **Scoring Triggers**:  
  - Whether **all**, **none**, or **some** players identify the storyteller’s card determines base scoring.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Scoring is applied after each round:

| Scenario | Storyteller | Correct Guessers | Card Owner (non-storyteller) |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **All or none** guess correctly | 0 points | 2 points | +1 point per vote on their card |
| **Some (but not all)** guess correctly | 3 points | 3 points | +1 point per vote on their card |

Additional Notes:  
- Players earn **+1 point** for each vote their submitted card receives, regardless of whether it was correct.  
- The game ends when the deck runs out and a player cannot refill their hand after a round.  
- The player with the **highest score** wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Ties in voting?** Multiple cards can receive votes; only the storyteller’s card earns guessing points.  
- **Lonely vote (veto)**: In some house rules or expansions, a card that receives exactly one vote (especially the storyteller’s own card) may trigger special scoring, but per official rules here, it does not.  
- **Alternative rule mentioned**: Storyteller gives clue *before* seeing their cards — this is optional.  
- **Maximum bonus**: A non-storyteller can earn up to 5 points per round: 2 or 3 for guessing correctly, plus up to 2 or 3 bonus points if both other players (in 3-player) vote for their submitted card.
