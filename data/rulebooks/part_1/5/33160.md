## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Endeavor is a strategy game of empire-building across the globe during the age of exploration. Players develop their nation through industry, culture, finance, and politics to earn the most Glory points over 7 rounds. The goal is to expand influence by shipping to regions, occupying cities, drawing asset cards, and constructing buildings, while managing population and status tracks effectively.

2. Components  
- Game board showing world regions (Africa, Far East, South America, Central Asia, Europe & Mediterranean)  
- Player boards (1 per player)  
- Building tiles (Levels 1–5, in types: Market, Shipyard, Workshop, Bank, Barracks, Guild Hall, Docks, Fortress, Theater, Cartographer, Trade Office, University, Exchange, Museum, Parliament)  
- Population markers (30 per player)  
- Status markers (4 per player: Industry, Culture, Finance, Politics)  
- Trade tokens (with icons for Industry, Culture, Finance, Politics, Glory, and Action)  
- Asset cards (by region, including Slavery and Governor cards)  
- First Player Marker  
- Scoring chips (5, 10, 50 points)

3. Setup  
- Place the board centrally.  
- Randomly distribute one Trade token (glory-side down) on each City, Connection, and Shipping Track space.  
- Sort Asset cards by region and stack face-up in order: bottom to top = 5-4-3-2-1 (or 5-4-3-2-1-0 for Slavery and Europe & Mediterranean). Place Governor cards next to their respective decks.  
- Prepare building stacks:  
  - Level 1: 5 each of Market, Shipyard, Workshop  
  - Level 2: 4 each of Bank, Barracks, Guild Hall  
  - Level 3: 3 each of Docks, Fortress, Theater  
  - Level 4: 2 each of Cartographer, Trade Office, University  
  - Level 5: 1 each of Exchange, Museum, Parliament  
- Give each player:  
  - 1 player board  
  - 30 Population markers  
  - 4 Status markers (set to 0 on tracks)  
- Place 1 Population marker in the activation circle of the starting building (if applicable).  
- Randomly select first player and give them the First Player Marker.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 7 rounds. Each round has 4 phases:

1. **Build Phase** (turn order)  
   - Each player must build 1 building.  
   - Choose from available tiles.  
   - Must meet Industry level requirement (cannot build above current Industry level unless no lower-level buildings remain).  
   - May build duplicate buildings.  
   - Only one Level 5 building allowed per player.  
   - Gain status icons (Industry, Culture, Finance, Politics) if building has them.

2. **Growth Phase** (turn order)  
   - Add Population markers from supply to Harbor.  
   - Number added = current Culture level.  
   - If supply is insufficient, add as many as possible.

3. **Salary Phase** (turn order)  
   - Move Population markers from buildings back to Harbor.  
   - Number of moves = current Finance level.  
   - Choose which markers to return if more markers on buildings than allowed payments.  
   - Excess payments are lost if fewer markers than payments.

4. **Action Phase** (turn order, continues until all pass)  
   - Players take one action at a time until all pass.  
   - Actions can be taken by:  
     a) **Activating a Building**: Move 1 Population marker from Harbor to empty activation circle of a building and perform its action(s).  
     b) **Spending a Blue Trade Token**: Discard a blue Action token to perform its action.  
   - Available Actions:  
     - **Ship**: Move 1 marker from Harbor to the farthest unclaimed space on a region’s Shipping Track. Take the Trade token there.  
       - If track is full, marker is placed beside track; no token gained.  
       - Europe & Mediterranean cannot be shipped to.  
       - When last space is taken, region opens:  
         - Governor card awarded to player with most markers on track (tiebreaker: closest to deck).  
         - Governor card may be placed in free Governor slot or normal slot.  
         - Region is now open for Occupy, Draw, and Attack actions.  
         - Europe & Mediterranean is open from start.  
     - **Occupy**: Move 1 marker from Harbor to unoccupied city in open region. Take Trade token.  
       - Requires presence: ≥1 marker in region (on track or in city).  
       - All players have automatic presence in Europe & Mediterranean.  
       - Controlling a Connection: If you occupy both cities of a connection, take its Trade token.  
     - **Attack**: Spend 2 markers.  
       - Remove 1 from Harbor to supply.  
       - Replace opponent’s marker in a city with your own (opponent’s marker returns to supply).  
       - Requires presence in region.  
       - Can create connection control.  
     - **Payment**: Move 1 marker from activation circle of any building back to Harbor (freeing it for future activation).  
     - **Draw**: Take top card from open region’s deck.  
       - Must have ≥ number of markers in region as card value.  
       - In Europe & Mediterranean: only markers in cities count; both decks (Europe and Mediterranean) can be drawn from using any city.  
       - May exceed card limit when drawing.  
       - **Abolition of Slavery (Card 5 in Europe deck)**:  
         - When drawn, all players discard all Slavery cards (set aside face-down).  
         - Lose corresponding status icons.  
         - Remaining Slavery cards on board are removed.  
         - Discarded Slavery cards count as -1 Glory each at endgame.  
     - **Pass**:  
       - Check card limit (equal to Politics score).  
       - Discard down to limit.  
       - May keep 1 extra Slavery card beyond limit (max 5 cards total).  
       - May keep 1 Governor card in free slot (does not count toward limit).  
       - Discarded cards return to decks (in original order), except:  
         - Governor cards are removed from game.  
         - Slavery cards are kept face-down near player board for penalty.  
       - May rearrange cards in slots.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Status Tracks**: Industry, Culture, Finance, Politics determine build level, growth, salary, and card limit.  
- **Building Activation**: Powers actions; can have single or dual (e.g., Action + Action). Dual actions may be taken in different regions (2nd ed. rule).  
- **Population Management**: Markers used for activation, shipping, occupying, attacking. Must be returned via Salary.  
- **Region Opening**: Triggered by filling Shipping Track; awards Governor card and unlocks actions.  
- **Presence**: Required for actions in a region; defined as ≥1 marker in region (cities or shipping track). Always present in Europe.  
- **Card Drawing**: Based on card value and presence; optional discard rule allows access to discarded cards from Europe (2nd ed.).

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after 7 rounds (or when Build phase fills last building space).  
Score Glory points as follows:  
1. **Cities & Connections**:  
   - 1 Glory token per Glory icon on each city you occupy.  
   - 1 Glory token per connection you control (both cities occupied by you).  
2. **Status Tracks**:  
   - Push marker down to next space with an icon; sum all icons passed.  
3. **Cards**:  
   - Sum Glory icons on all held Asset cards.  
4. **Empty Governor Slot**:  
   - 3 Glory tokens if free Governor slot is empty.  
5. **University Building**:  
   - 3 Glory tokens per University built.  
6. **Leftover Population**:  
   - 1 Glory token per 3 markers remaining in Harbor.  
7. **Penalties**:  
   - Lose 1 Glory per Slavery card discarded (set aside face-down).  
   - No penalty for non-discarded Slavery cards.  
- Winner is player with most Glory points. Tie = shared victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I activate a building without an activation circle?** No. Only buildings with activation circles can be activated.  
- **Can I use a blue token to perform any action?** Yes, if the token has the matching action icon.  
- **What happens if I can’t pay salary?** You return as many markers as possible. Excess payments are lost.  
- **Can I occupy a city without taking the Trade token?** No—occupying always includes taking the token.  
- **Do neutral tokens count for presence?** Only in official variants (e.g., 2P/3P with neutrals); not in base game.  
- **Can I use dual-action buildings in different regions?** Yes (2nd edition rule).  
- **When does Abolition of Slavery trigger?** When any player draws Card 5 from Europe deck. All players immediately discard Slavery cards.
