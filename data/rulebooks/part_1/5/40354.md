# Comprehensive Reference Manual

Maria simulates the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), where players take on the roles of historical leaders vying for dominance in Central Europe. The game centers on political maneuvering, military campaigns, and shifting alliances.

**Objective**: A major power wins immediately if it empties its victory marker (VM) pool during any stage of the game. If no power achieves this by the end of the fourth winter, the major power with the lowest total winter score wins.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn follows this sequence:
1. **Politics Stage** (Advanced only)
2. **Austria Places Hussars**
3. **Action Stage: France & Bavaria**
4. **Action Stage: Prussia & Saxony**
5. **Action Stage: Austria & Pragmatic Army**

After every 3 turns, conduct **Winter**:
- Recruit troops (4 TCs per troop)
- Re-enter generals
- Winter scoring (secretly record 1 point per VM in pool)

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Stacks and Troops
- Only one piece per city, except two generals may stack.
- Stack conditions: same power or cooperating powers (France-Bavaria, Prussia-Saxony, Austria-Pragmatic Army).
- In a stack, lower-rank general is supreme commander (on top).
- Stack troop total is shared (2–16 troops); transfer freely between stacked generals of same power.
- Each general must have 1–8 troops.

### Supply
- Inside home country: always in supply.
- Outside: must be ≤6 cities from own supply train; path cannot go through enemy pieces.
- Out of supply:
  - Face-up general: flip face-down, lose 1 troop.
  - Face-down general: stay face-down, lose 2 troops.
- Back in supply: flip face-up.
- **Hussar Penalty**: If tracing supply through hussar, pay 1 TC per city in path. If unable to pay, suffer out-of-supply consequences and reveal all TCs.

### Movement
- General: 3 cities (4 if entire move on main road)
- Supply Train: 2 cities (3 on main road)
- **Force March** (generals only):
  - Up to 8 cities on main road only.
  - Cannot enter or pass through enemy-controlled fortress.
  - Cannot enter city adjacent to enemy piece.
- **Conquering Fortresses**:
  - Only face-up general can conquer.
  - Conquer by moving out of unprotected enemy fortress.
  - Fortress is protected if friendly or cooperating general is within 3 cities.
  - Cannot conquer while force marching.
- **Re-entering Supply Trains**:
  - Cost: 4 TCs.
  - Location: friendly-controlled major fortress in home country or cooperating minor power's major fortress.
  - Cannot move in current turn.
- **Retroactive Conquest**:
  - Mark protected fortress with "?" when exiting.
  - If unprotected at retroactive conquest phase, it is conquered.

### Combat
- Must attack adjacent enemy generals (even on different maps).
- Attacker chooses order if multiple combats.
- **Combat Resolution**:
  1. Reveal troop counts.
  2. Player with fewer troops plays first TC of their general's sector suit.
  3. Players alternate playing TCs until one cannot/will not play.
  4. Final negative score = troop loss and retreat distance.
- **Tie**: If score reaches zero and player cannot play TC (excluding Reserve), combat is a tie (no losses).
- **Retreat**:
  - Winner chooses path.
  - Must retreat full distance, as far from winner as possible.
  - Cannot enter city twice or any occupied city.
  - If cannot retreat fully, lose all troops and remove general.

### Politics (Advanced Game)
- **Reveal 2 Political Cards**.
- **Determine Trump**: Most recent combat winner chooses suit. If none, reveal TCs until non-Reserve; its suit is trump.
- **Place TCs**: Major powers may place 1 TC face-down (left to right order).
- **Determine Influence**: Reveal cards. Non-trump cards return to hand. Sum trump value + conserved TCs. Reserve = 16. Highest sum wins; tiebreaker: rightmost on display.
- **Select Cards**: Highest influence chooses to:
  - Conserve TCs (remain on display)
  - Select a Political Card (if it shows their coat of arms)
- Once both cards are selected, remaining powers take back TCs.
- **Execute Cards**: Follow instructions and/or shift political markers (Italy, Russia, Saxony).

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### Victory Conditions
- **Immediate Win**: Any major power empties its VM pool at end of any action stage, political stage, or Imperial Election.
- **End of Game**: After 4th winter, lowest total winter score wins.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Power that could have played most VMs if available wins.
  2. Maria Theresa wins all ties; Louis XV loses all ties.

### Winter Scoring
- After each winter, each major power secretly records 1 point per VM in pool.
- Total after 4 winters; lowest score wins.

### Victory Boxes
- **Battle Victory**: 1 VM per 3 troops eliminated (or 1 VM if general removed with <3 troops). Winner gains, loser loses.
- **3 Electors**: Control 3 of 4 fortresses (Mainz, Trier, Köln, Mannheim) → 1 VM.
- **Emperor**: Austria or France gains 1 VM based on Imperial Election.
- **Italy**: Austria or France gains 1 VM when political card triggers it.
- **Silesia**: Prussia gains 1 VM when it annexes Silesia.

### Imperial Election (1742)
- 9 elector fortresses (e.g., Berlin, Dresden) grant 1 vote each.
- Automatic votes for Francis (Austria): Austria, Pragmatic Army, neutral Saxony.
- Others choose candidate: Charles Albert (France) or Francis Stephen (Austria).
- Voting: clockwise starting with Austria; no abstentions.
- Winner: Francis → Austria gains VM; Charles → France gains VM.
