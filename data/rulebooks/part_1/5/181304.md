## Mysterium: Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the roles of psychics and one ghost. The ghost was murdered and now haunts a mansion, trying to communicate with psychics during a séance to uncover the identity of their murderer. The psychics must interpret abstract vision cards to determine the correct suspect (character), location, and weapon tied to each psychic’s assigned mystery.  

The ultimate goal is for all psychics to correctly identify their assigned character, location, and object within 7 rounds. If successful, the ghost then gives one final clue (three vision cards) to help the psychics identify which suspect was the actual murderer. If the group correctly identifies the true culprit, all players win and the ghost’s soul is freed.

### 3. Setup  
#### Player Roles  
- One player becomes the **ghost**; all others are **psychics**.  
- The ghost may remain silent, using knocks (one = yes, two = no) to confirm intuitions.

#### Clairvoyancy Tokens  
Distribute based on total players:  
- 2–3 players: 0 tokens  
- 4–5 players: 4 tokens (numbered 1–4)  
- 6–7 players: 6 tokens (numbered 1–6)  

Each psychic receives:  
- 1 intuition token  
- 1 sleeve  
- 1 clairvoyancy level marker (placed at “0” on the track)  

Place the **clock** with the hour hand at I (1st hour). The space in front is the discard area for clairvoyancy tokens.

Arrange progress boards in order: Character, Location, Object, Epilogue. Place the clairvoyancy track around the epilogue board, using the side matching the player count.

#### Ghost Screen Setup  
The screen has columns for each psychic and rows for Character, Location, and Object.

1. Shuffle **psychic character cards** and draw the number indicated by player count.  
2. Find matching **ghost character cards** and give them to the ghost.  
3. The ghost shuffles these and places one per psychic in their column behind the screen. Return extras to the box.  
4. Repeat for **location** and **object** cards.  

Each psychic now has a hidden triplet: character, location, object.

The ghost receives:  
- 6 culprit tokens  
- 3 crow markers (base)  
- Ghost tokens (one per psychic, placed behind screen)  
- Vision deck: draw 7 cards to start  

#### Difficulty Settings (Crow Markers)  
- Easy: 1 crow per round  
- Medium: 3 crows per game  
- Hard: 1 crow per game

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game has two phases. Phase 1 lasts up to 7 rounds.

#### Phase 1: Reconstruction of Events  
**Goal:** Each psychic identifies their assigned character, then location, then object.

Each round has two steps:

##### Step 1: Vision Interpretation  
- The ghost gives **one or more vision cards** to a psychic, placing them faceup.  
- Places the matching **ghost token** against the screen to mark that psychic has received cards.  
- Draws back up to 7 vision cards.  
- Repeats until all psychics have received at least one card.  

Once all have cards, the **sand timer is started**.

Psychics may:  
- Discuss interpretations freely  
- Examine their vision cards and psychic cards  
- Place their **intuition token** on any candidate card (character, location, or object)  
- Move intuition tokens until time runs out  

**Clairvoyancy Tokens (✓ and ×):**  
- Any psychic may place **one token per intuition token** (not their own)  
- ✓ = agree, × = disagree  
- Only one token per intuition token allowed  
- Tokens discarded after use; returned at start of **round 4**  
- Correct ✓ or × advances the psychic who played it by 1 on the clairvoyancy track  

**Discarding Vision Cards (Crows):**  
- At any time, the ghost may **discard all or part of their hand** and draw back to 7  
- Each such action uses **one crow marker**  
- Limited by difficulty setting  

##### Step 2: Spectral Manifestation  
The ghost reveals whether each psychic guessed correctly, in any order.

- **Correct guess:**  
  - Flip the ghost card behind the screen  
  - Psychics who played a ✓ token advance 1 on clairvoyancy track  
  - Psychic takes the psychic card, places it in sleeve  
  - Discards vision cards  
  - Moves intuition token to next progress board (e.g., from Character to Location)  

- **Incorrect guess:**  
  - Psychics who played a × token advance 1 on clairvoyancy track  
  - Psychic keeps vision cards and intuition token remains on current board  
  - Will receive additional vision cards in future rounds  

After resolving all psychics:  
- Move hour hand forward 1 hour  
- If clock reaches **VIII**, game ends in loss  

**Early Completion Bonus:**  
If a psychic completes all three cards before round 7, they:  
- Move intuition token to "Mission Accomplished" on epilogue board  
- Advance clairvoyancy marker **1 space per remaining round**  
- Continue helping others and using clairvoyancy tokens  

Repeat rounds until:  
- All psychics have all 3 cards → proceed to **Phase 2**  
- Clock reaches VIII → all players lose

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Vision Cards  
- Abstract, symbolic artwork  
- Used by ghost to suggest character, location, or object  
- Can be reused across rounds  
- Ghost may discard and redraw (limited by crow markers)  

#### Clairvoyancy Track  
- Tracks psychic insight  
- Advances based on correct use of ✓/× tokens  
- Used in Phase 2 to determine voting order and tie-breaking  

#### Crow Markers  
- Allow ghost to refresh vision hand  
- Limited by difficulty  
- Placed on screen when used

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Phase 2: Revealing the Culprit  
**Only played if all psychics completed their triplets before round 8.**

##### Step 1: Suspect Line-up  
- Psychics remove cards from sleeves and group them into **suspect triads**  
- Each triad gets a **numbered ghost token** (1 to N)  
- Unused psychic cards and progress boards returned to box  
- Psychics retrieve all clairvoyancy tokens  

##### Step 2: Shared Vision  
- Ghost selects **3 vision cards** that each relate to one element (character, location, object) of the **true culprit’s triad**  
- Shuffles and places them **face down** in center  
- Secretly places matching **culprit token** face down on epilogue board  

##### Step 3: Straw Poll (Voting)  
- Psychics vote **secretly** using clairvoyancy tokens  
- Voting order based on clairvoyancy level:  
  - Level 1: Sees **1** vision card before voting  
  - Level 2: Sees **2** vision cards before voting  
  - Level 3: Sees **all 3** vision cards before voting  
- Each psychic places a **numbered clairvoyancy token** in their sleeve, indicating their chosen suspect group  

**Vote Reveal:**  
- Highest clairvoyancy psychic (eldest on tie) collects sleeves and reveals votes  
- Votes are placed on corresponding suspect groups  

**Determine Chosen Group:**  
- Group with **most votes** wins  
- Tie: broken by **highest clairvoyancy level** among voters for tied groups  
- Still tied: **eldest player’s choice** breaks the tie  

**Final Reveal:**  
- Reveal culprit token  
- If chosen group contains true culprit → **all win**  
- Otherwise → **all lose**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can multiple psychics be assigned the same character?**  
A: No. Each psychic has a unique combination. Duplicate assignments are avoided during setup.  

**Q: Can the ghost speak?**  
A: The ghost may remain silent (recommended). If they speak, they risk giving direct clues, which breaks immersion. Knocking (1 = yes, 2 = no) is a silent alternative.  

**Q: What happens if a psychic finishes early?**  
A: They move to "Mission Accomplished" and gain +1 clairvoyancy per remaining round. They continue helping others and using clairvoyancy tokens.  

**Q: Can clairvoyancy tokens be reused?**  
A: Yes. Discarded after each round, but **returned at the start of round 4**.  

**Q: Can the ghost give different numbers of cards to different psychics?**  
A: Yes. The ghost may give 1 card to one psychic and 3 to another.  

**Q: What if the vision deck runs out?**  
A: Shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.  

**Q: Can a psychic change their intuition token placement after seeing others’ choices?**  
A: Yes, until the sand timer runs out.  

**Q: Do vision cards have to exactly match the element?**  
A: No. The ghost uses symbolic, interpretive clues. Exact matches are rare; thematic or emotional resonance is key.
