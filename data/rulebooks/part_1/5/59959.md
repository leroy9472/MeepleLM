# LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL — COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE MANUAL

### 1. Lore & Objective
In 1888, Jack the Ripper stalks the streets of Whitechapel, targeting vulnerable women known as "the Wretched." One player takes the role of Jack, attempting to murder five victims over four nights while evading capture. The other players are detectives working cooperatively to deduce Jack’s movements and arrest him before he returns to his secret hideout.

**Objective:**
- **Jack wins** by successfully committing five murders (one per night, two on Night 3) and escaping back to his hideout each night without being caught.
- **Detectives win** by arresting Jack during any night or preventing him from reaching his hideout within 15 moves.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game consists of **4 Nights**, each divided into two parts:

#### FIRST PART: HELL (Jack's Preparation Phase)
1. **Jack: Preparing the Scene**  
   Receive Special Movement tokens:
   - Night 1: 3 Coach, 2 Alley  
   - Night 2: 2 Coach, 2 Alley  
   - Night 3: 2 Coach, 1 Alley  
   - Night 4: 1 Coach, 1 Alley

2. **Jack: The Targets are Identified**  
   Place Woman tokens face-down on red-numbered circles:
   - Night 1: 8 Women (5 marked)  
   - Night 2: 7 Women (4 marked)  
   - Night 3: 6 Women (3 marked)  
   - Night 4: 4 Women (1 marked)  
   On subsequent nights, cannot place on circles with existing Crime Scene tokens.

3. **Police: Patrolling the Streets**  
   Reveal top Head of the Investigation tile. That detective:
   - **Night 1:** Places 7 Police Patrol tokens face-down on any yellow-bordered crossings.
   - **Nights 2–4:** Places 5 tokens on previous night's Policeman pawn locations (colors/fakes can differ), and 2 on unoccupied yellow-bordered crossings.

4. **Jack: The Victims are Chosen**  
   Turn all Woman tokens face-up. Replace red-marked ones with Wretched pawns. Remove unmarked tokens. Place Time of the Crime token on Roman numeral I.

5. **Jack: Blood on the Streets**  
   Decide: Kill or Wait.
   - If **Kill**:
     - Replace one Wretched pawn with a Crime Scene token.
     - On Night 3, do this twice (Double Event).
     - Proceed to *A Corpse on the Sidewalk*.
   - If **Wait** and Time token ≠ V:
     - Move Time of the Crime token forward one space.
     - Head of the Investigation moves each Wretched pawn to an adjacent, unoccupied circle.
       - Cannot move adjacent to or across a Police Patrol token.
       - Cannot enter a circle with a Crime Scene token.
       - If no legal move, stays in place.
     - Jack reveals one Police Patrol token:
       - If fake (blank), remove it.
       - If real, leave it face-up.
     - Return to step 5.

6. **Jack: A Corpse on the Sidewalk**  
   - Record the crime scene number on the move sheet in the cell corresponding to the current Time of the Crime numeral (row = current night).
   - Place second Jack pawn on the Move track at the current Time of the Crime space.
   - Jack is now located at the crime scene.

7. **Police: Alarm Whistles**  
   - Reveal all remaining Patrol tokens.
   - Replace color-marked tokens with matching Policeman pawns.
   - Remove fake tokens.
   - Remove all Wretched pawns from board.

#### SECOND PART: HUNTING (Chase Phase)
1. **Jack: Escape in the Night**  
   - Move to an adjacent numbered circle via dotted lines.
   - Cannot move through a crossing occupied by a Policeman pawn unless using a Coach.
   - Secretly record destination on move sheet (next space in current night’s row).
   - Advance Jack pawn one space right on Move track.
   - May use a Special Movement token instead of normal move.
     - **Coach:** Move through two adjacent circles (record both), may pass through Policemen.
     - **Alley:** Move to any circle on the same block perimeter.
   - If Jack lands on his hideout via normal move, may declare escape and end the night.
   - If no legal move and no tokens left, Jack loses.

2. **Police: Hunting the Monster**  
   - Starting with Head of the Investigation, detectives move their Policeman pawns clockwise.
   - Each pawn may move up to 2 crossings (along dotted lines, ignoring circles).
   - Can move over other pawns, but cannot end on same crossing.

3. **Police: Clues and Suspicion**  
   For each Policeman pawn, choose one action:
   - **Looking for Clues:** Announce adjacent circle numbers one by one. Jack places a Clue token if that number appears anywhere in current night’s row on his sheet. Action ends when a clue is found or no more adjacent circles.
   - **Executing an Arrest:** Announce one adjacent circle. If it matches Jack’s current location (most recent number on sheet), Jack is arrested and loses.
   - **Optional – Rushing:** Move a pawn to an adjacent crossing (used during Clues phase).
   - **Optional – Area Arrests:** Announce all adjacent circles; if any is Jack’s current location, he is caught.

   If Jack is not caught and hasn’t escaped, repeat from Hunting Phase 1.

#### End of Night
- Remove all Clue tokens.
- Leave Policeman pawns and Crime Scene tokens.
- Remove Special Movement tokens and Jack pawn from Move track.
- Discard unused False Clue tokens (if used).
- Jack advances to next Night on Night track.

#### Special Rule: Third Night (Double Event)
- Jack kills two Wretched pawns.
- Records both crime scene numbers in two consecutive cells: one under current Time of Crime numeral, one to the right (order chosen by Jack).
- Second murder counts as Jack’s first move.
- Detectives act first: Hunting starts at Phase 2.
- Jack begins escape from the second (rightmost) recorded location.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Jack’s Movement:** Must move each turn. Records path secretly. Maximum 15 moves per night.
- **Special Movements:**
  - **Coach:** Two moves in one turn; may pass through Policemen; uses two move spaces.
  - **Alley:** Teleports within same city block; cannot be blocked by Police.
- **Clue System:** Detectives search locations Jack has visited (not current location); only one Clue token per circle.
- **Arrest:** Only possible during Clues phase by naming Jack’s exact current location.
- **Hideout Rule:** Final move into hideout must be a normal move, not a Special Movement.
- **Waiting Mechanic:** Jack can delay killing, forcing Wretched to move and revealing Police positions.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Jack wins** if he completes all four nights, having killed five victims and escaped to his hideout each time.
- **Detectives win** if:
  - They arrest Jack during any night.
  - Jack cannot make a legal move and has no Special Movement tokens.
  - Jack fails to reach his hideout within 15 moves.

---

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can Jack stay on a circle and then enter hideout next turn?**  
  No. If Jack moves to his hideout, he must either declare escape or move away immediately. He cannot “wait” on it.

- **Can Jack use Special Movement on first turn?**  
  Yes, including after a murder or during the Double Event.

- **Can multiple clues be placed on the same circle?**  
  No. Only one Clue token per circle, even if Jack visits multiple times.

- **What if a Wretched has no legal move?**  
  It remains in place.

- **Can Police move through Jack?**  
  Yes. Movement does not reveal Jack unless an arrest is attempted.

- **Does Jack know where Policemen are after they’re revealed?**  
  Yes. Once Patrol tokens are revealed and replaced with pawns, Jack knows their positions.

- **Can Jack use a Coach to return to his starting circle?**  
  No. Both moves must be to new, different circles.

- **Can Jack be caught in a crime scene circle?**  
  Yes, if detectives arrest him there and it is his current location.
