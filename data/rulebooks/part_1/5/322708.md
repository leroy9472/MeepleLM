### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of two phases:  

#### **Hero Phase**  
- Heroes take turns in any order (chosen by players).  
- On their turn, a Hero may:  
  1. Perform a **Maneuver Action** (gains Movement Points = Speed stat).  
  2. Perform up to two other actions (any type, including another Maneuver).  
- Actions include:  
  - **Maneuver**: Gain movement points.  
  - **Combat**: Attack an adjacent or ranged enemy.  
  - **Explore**: Interact with terrain or exploration tokens.  
  - **Organize**: Flip any card in play (Hero, Attack, Skill, Companion).  
  - **Unique (◆)**: Use a card ability (costs 1 or 2 actions).  
- After actions:  
  - Spend remaining movement (e.g., via **Glide** keyword).  
  - Resolve abilities (e.g., **Prepared** token removal).  

#### **Darkness Phase**  
1. **Time Passes**:  
   - Infected Heroes suffer damage = number of Infection tokens.  
   - Terrified Heroes suffer fatigue = number of Terreur tokens.  
   - Each Hero may discard 1 Fatigue token.  
2. **Enemy Activation**:  
   - Enemies activate one by one (order shown in app).  
   - For each:  
     - Gain Movement Points = Speed.  
     - Choose target (priority: assigned target → closest Hero → lowest Health).  
     - Move toward target (must end within attack range).  
     - Attack (if possible).  
3. **Quest Events**: App may trigger story events, spawn enemies, or update objectives.  
4. **Enemy Tactics**: App may preview a special enemy activation for next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Movement  
- Spend 1 Movement Point to enter an adjacent tile.  
- **Blocked by**: 3D terrain (except barricades, stairs), other Heroes/Enemies (unless passing through).  
- **Gained**:  
  - Maneuver Action → Speed MP (reduced to 1 if **Engaged**).  
  - **Glide** keyword → Move up to X tiles without spending MP.  
- **Water Strata**: Spend +1 MP to exit.  
- **Stairs/Escalators**: Allow vertical movement between levels.  

#### Combat  
**Hero Attack (Combat Action)**  
1. Choose enemy in range and line of sight.  
2. Select weapon (face-up on Attack Card).  
3. Roll attack die (from Hero card).  
4. Modify roll:  
   - Convert **Advantage (+)** to **Success (★)** by assigning Fatigue.  
   - Spend **Surge (4)** to use Augmented abilities.  
5. Enter successes in app → App calculates damage:  
   - Base = Weapon Damage × Successes.  
   - +1 per Success per **Weakness** type (if enemy is vulnerable).  
   - +20% if enemy is **Exposed**.  
   - -20% if enemy is **Weakened**.  
6. Enemy reduces damage by random value (0 to Defense value).  

**Enemy Attack**  
- During activation, enemy attacks target.  
- Hero defends by rolling defense die.  
- Each **Success (★)** reduces damage by 1.  
- **Advantage (+)** → Convert to Success by assigning Fatigue.  
- **Surge (4)** → Use Augmented abilities.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use both sides of a Skill card?**  
  No. Only the face-up side is active. Flip via Organize action.

  Yes. You may reroll 1 die per Canalisé token, after seeing initial roll.  
- **What happens if I can’t assign fatigue?**  
  You suffer 1 damage per unassigned fatigue.  
- **Do barricades block movement?**  
  No, but they do not block line of sight either.  
- **Can I attack through an overhang?**  
  Yes, if line of sight is clear. Overhangs only block if line passes under without valid exit tile.
