## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Let's Go! To Japan*, players are travelers competing to plan and experience the most personally fulfilling dream vacation across Tokyo and Kyoto. Over 13 planning rounds, players build a 6-day itinerary by placing Activity Cards, then “go on their trip” in a final scoring round. The player with the most Victory Points (VP) wins by maximizing experiences, managing mood, and fulfilling personal goals.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **13 Rounds**, each with three phases:  
1. **Draw Cards**  
2. **Play Cards**  
3. **End of Round**  

After Round 13, the **Final Round ("Going On A Trip!")** begins for scoring.

#### 1) Draw Cards  
Players draw cards simultaneously based on the Round Tracker:  

| Round | Draw | Play | Pass |  
|-------|------|------|------|  
| 1–6 | 1 Tokyo + 1 Kyoto | 1 | 1 |  
| 7 | 2 Tokyo + 2 Kyoto | 2 | 2 |  
| 8–12 | 1 from either deck | 1 | 1 |  
| 13 | 1 from either deck + 1 from player board stack | 1 | 0 |  

- In Round 13, players draw their choice of 1 card from Tokyo or Kyoto, then the 1 remaining card from their player board (cannot look before choosing deck).  

#### 2) Play Cards  
Each player plays the number of cards indicated (1 or 2) from their hand to their itinerary.  

**Actions Available**:  
- **Plan an Activity**  
- **Go For a Walk**  
- **Use Research Token(s)**  
- **Earn Day Bonus** (if 3rd card placed in a day)  

##### Plan an Activity  
- Place a card in any day column (Mon–Sat).  
- May place **on top, underneath, or between** existing cards.  
- Cards must **overlap** so upper icons are visible.  
- Max **3 cards per day** (except Extra Walks).  
- Once placed, cards **cannot be moved or removed**.  
- **No card** may be played on the day with the Day Trip Card.  

##### Go For a Walk  
Instead of playing a card:  
1. Discard 1 card from hand to discard pile.  
2. Take 1 **facedown** card from either Tokyo or Kyoto deck.  
3. Place it **facedown** in any day column (as 3rd or 4th card).  
4. Gain **1 Research Token**.  

> *Note: Facedown Walk Cards are always counted as the city on their back, even if revealed as yellow later.*  

##### Research Tokens  
At any time **after drawing, before passing**, a player may:  
- Discard **1 Research Token** → Draw **3 cards** (any combo from Tokyo/Kyoto decks) → Immediately discard **3 cards** to the faceup pile.  
- May use **multiple** Research Tokens per round, completing each draw/discard before the next.  
- Unused Research Tokens are worth **1 VP** each at game end.  

##### Day Bonus  
When a player places the **3rd card** in a day column:  
1. Count how many **icons** in the 3 cards match the day’s **Favorable Condition Token**.  
2. Choose one reward (may take lesser reward):  

| Matches | Reward |  
|--------|--------|  
| 1 | Move Mood Tracker Token **1 space right** |  
| 2 | Gain **2 Research Tokens** OR **1 Wild Token** |  
| 3+ | Gain **1 Luxury Train Token** OR take an **Extra Walk** |  

##### Extra Walk  
- Take 1 **facedown** card from either deck.  
- Place it as a **4th card** in the same day.  
- **No Research Token gained**.  
- Otherwise treated like a regular Walk card during scoring.  

#### 3) End of Round  
- **Pass Cards**: Remaining cards are passed:  
  - **Rounds 1–7**: Pass to **left** neighbor.  
  - **Rounds 8–13**: Pass to **right** neighbor.  
- Place passed cards **facedown** on the upper-right corner of the recipient’s board.  
- Move Round Tracker Token **1 space right**.  
- After Round 13, proceed to **Final Round**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Anatomy  
- **Top Section**: Icons for Experience Track and Mood Track movement.  
- **Top-Right**: Base VP value.  
- **Bottom Section**: “Highlight of the Day” bonus (requirements + bonus VP).  
- **City**: Blue (Tokyo), Pink (Kyoto), Yellow (neutral — player chooses city).  

#### Mood Tracker  
- Moves left (stress) or right (happiness) during final scoring.  
- **Rightmost space**: Move Happiness Token 1 right, reset Mood to center.  
- **Leftmost space**: Move Stress Token 1 right, reset Mood to center.  
- If Happiness/Stress Token is already at rightmost, it stays; Mood still resets.  

#### Experience Track  
- Each icon advances its token 1 space.  
- Max score per track: **15 VP** (for reaching 12).  
- If a token passes 12:  
  - Move back to 0.  
  - Take a **+12 Token** (for tracking).  
  - Token stops scoring beyond 15 VP.  

#### Trains  
Required when switching cities between days.  
- **Starting Train Token**: Free (no VP effect).  
- **Luxury Train Token**: +2 VP, +1 Happiness (Mood Tracker right).  
- **Regular Train Token**: -2 VP (taken from supply).  

> *Yellow Cards*: Player chooses city when placing trains.  
> *Walk Cards*: Always count as city on back.  

Any Train Token used counts toward "Highlight of the Day" requirements.  

#### Wild Tokens  
- Can be used **at any time during Final Round** to move **1 Experience Token 1 space right**.  
- Can fulfill "Highlight of the Day" Experience requirements and scoring.  
- **Cannot** be used for Mood, Research, Train, or Walk effects.  

#### Walks (Final Round)  
When scoring a **facedown Walk or Extra Walk card**:  
1. **Reveal** the card.  
2. Choose:  
   - **Play face-up**: Activate all card effects. Place **Walk Token** on card (counts as Walk icon).  
   - **Leave face-down**: Gain 1 Happiness (Mood right), 1 Walk icon, and **2 VP** (only if in "Highlight of the Day" position).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Final Round: "Going On A Trip!"  
Players score from **Monday to Saturday**, top to bottom per day.  

**For each card (top to bottom)**:  
- Score **VP** (top-right).  
- Advance **Experience Tokens** per icons.  
- Move **Mood Tracker** per icons (reset if hits end).  
- For **facedown Walk/Extra Walk**: Reveal and choose to activate or leave down.  

**After all cards in a day**:  
- Score **“Highlight of the Day” bonus** if requirements met.  
  - Based on **icons and tokens activated up to that point** (including current card).  
  - Future icons do **not** count.  

#### Final Scoring  
Sum:  
1. **Itinerary Days**: All base VP + bonus VP from "Highlight of the Day".  
2. **Happiness/Stress Trackers**:  
   - Happiness: +1 VP per space right.  
   - Stress: -1 VP per space right.  
3. **Experience Tracks**:  
   - Score VP at furthest space reached (max 15).  
4. **Trains**:  
   - +2 VP per Luxury Train **used**.  
   - -2 VP per Regular Train used.  
   - Unused Luxury Trains: 0 VP.  
5. **Research Tokens**: +1 VP each (flip to 1 VP side).  

**Total all points**. Highest score wins.  

#### Tiebreaker  
1. Sum total **spaces moved** by all 5 Experience Tokens.  
2. If still tied, players share victory.

A: Yes. So do **facedown Walk Cards** (they show a Walk icon).
