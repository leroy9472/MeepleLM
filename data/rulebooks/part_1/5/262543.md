## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Wavelength is a social guessing game where two teams attempt to align their thinking with a hidden target on a spectrum between two opposing concepts (e.g., "Hot - Cold", "Safe - Dangerous"). One player per turn — the Psychic — knows the target’s location and gives a clue to guide their team. The goal is to rotate a red dial as close as possible to the hidden target zone. Teams earn points based on proximity, and the first to reach 10 points wins.

### 2. Components  
- Wavelength device (plastic housing with rotating wheel and red dial)  
- Blue screen (hides target)  
- Wavelength cards (double-sided, each with two opposing concepts)  
- Two team "head" markers (for score tracking, 0–10)  
- One pencil/guessing token (for non-active team’s left/right guess)  
- Card slot in device tray  

### 3. Setup  
1. Divide players into two teams.  
2. Place the Wavelength device upright in the box tray with the blue screen visible.  
3. Place each team’s head marker at “0” on their respective score track.  
4. The team going second moves their marker up 1 space (starts at 1 point).  
5. Draw one Wavelength card (or use “Advance” cards for higher difficulty) and insert it into the slot beneath the wheel.  
6. Choose the starting team; their Psychic begins the first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in turns. On each turn:  
1. **Psychic Phase**: The active team’s Psychic draws a card, spins the wheel to randomize the target, peeks at the target zone, and gives a clue.  
2. **Team Phase**: The Psychic’s team discusses and sets the red dial where they believe the target is.  
3. **Left/Right Phase**: The opposing team guesses whether the 4-point center is to the left or right of the dial, placing the pencil token accordingly.  
4. **Scoring Phase**: The Psychic reveals the target. Points are awarded.  
5. **Turn Transition**: The other team takes the next turn, unless the Catch-Up Rule applies.

Play continues until a team reaches 10+ points at the end of a turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Target Randomization**: The Psychic closes the blue screen, spins the wheel using the notched edges, then opens the screen fully to check the target. If the 4-point wedge is not visible, they must close and spin again.  
- **Clue Giving (Psychic)**:  
  - Must give a single, concise thought related to the spectrum.  
  - Cannot use words from the card or their synonyms (e.g., cannot say “peace” on “Peaceful - Warlike”).  
  - Cannot use numbers, percentages, or ratios (unless part of a proper noun, e.g., “Three’s Company”).  
  - Cannot invent fictional or hypothetical concepts (e.g., “a Batman movie directed by Wes Anderson”).  
  - Can use proper nouns (e.g., “Gandhi”, “Freddy Krueger”).  
  - Puns, rhymes, homonyms, and wordplay are discouraged and often violate “on topic” rules.  
- **Dial Placement**: The active team discusses openly (including input from the non-active team) and sets the dial. Final placement is binding once agreed upon.  
- **Left/Right Guess**: The non-active team places the pencil token in the LEFT or RIGHT slot to predict the direction of the 4-point wedge relative to the dial.  
- **Reveal & Scoring**:  
  - **Active Team**: Scores points based on the wedge the dial lands in (2, 3, or 4 points). If the dial is on a boundary, they score the higher value.  
  - **Non-Active Team**: Scores 1 point if their left/right guess is correct, **unless** the active team scored 4 points.  
- **Catch-Up Rule**: If the active team scores 4 points **and** is still behind after scoring, they immediately take another turn with a new Psychic.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when a team reaches 10 or more points at the end of a turn.  
- The team with the most points wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: If scores are tied, each team takes one additional “sudden death” turn. The team with the higher score after that round wins (including left/right point). If still tied, repeat.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Visible wedge on opposite side**: Ignore any partial target visible on the far side of the spectrum. Only the side containing the 4-point center matters.  
- **Clue uses a word from the card in a proper noun?** Allowed if on topic (e.g., “Happy” by Pharrell on “Sad Song - Happy Song” is acceptable).  
- **Can the Psychic clarify after giving a clue?** No. After closing the screen, the Psychic must remain silent and neutral. Any accidental or intentional leakage is resolved by group consensus (often results in a re-clue).  
- **Can teammates touch the dial?** Yes. Any team member may adjust it during discussion.  
- **What if the 4-point zone is barely visible?** Valid, as long as any part is in view. Do not spin again unless it’s completely hidden.
