# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
At the height of its power, the Roman Empire spanned vast territories and influenced major advancements in engineering, architecture, science, art, and literature. By the 5th century, political corruption, economic crisis, and military overextension weakened the Empire, enabling aggressive barbarian tribes to invade. In *Pandemic: Fall of Rome*, players take on roles within the Roman Empire, working cooperatively to defend cities, raise armies, and forge alliances with invading tribes.

**Objective**: Prevent the fall of Rome by either forging alliances with or eliminating all five barbarian tribes (Anglo-Saxons/Franks, Vandals, Huns, Visigoths, Ostrogoths) before the Empire collapses.

Players win if all five tribes are neutralized—either through alliance or complete removal from the board. The game ends in loss if:
- Roma is sacked.
- The Decline marker reaches the 8th space.
- A player cannot draw 2 Player cards.
- There are insufficient barbarian cubes to place during an invasion or revolt.

## 2. Components

  - 22 Vandals (red)
  - 20 Huns (green)
  - 24 Visigoths (yellow)
  - 14 Ostrogoths (blue)

- **6 Forts** (1 starts in Roma)
- **5 Alliance Tokens** (one per tribe)

## 3. Setup
### 1. Prepare Board and Pieces
- Place the board centrally.
- Place 1 fort in Roma; others near the board.
- Place legions in the supply.
- Place barbarian cubes and alliance tokens in their designated supply areas.

  1. Flip 3: Add 3 matching barbarians to each city shown.
  2. Flip 3: Add 2 matching barbarians to each city shown.
  3. Flip 3: Add 1 matching barbarian to each city shown.
- Place these 9 cards faceup on top of the Roma cards in the discard pile.

### 3. Prepare Player Components
- Give each player 1 random Role card, matching pawn, and Reference card.

### 4. Prepare Player Deck

- Return unused Revolt cards to the box.

### 5. Begin Play

## 4. Gameplay Flow

1. **Do 4 Actions**

After step 3, the turn ends. Play proceeds clockwise.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Migration Path Order**: Always check pictured city first, then move backward along path.
- **Revolt Card Draw**: Draw from **bottom** of Barbarian deck.
- **Intensify Step**: Shuffle only the **discard pile**, place on top of existing deck.
- **Event Cards**:
  - Can be played anytime except between drawing and resolving a card.
  - Not an action.
  - "Corrupt" option moves Decline marker down 1 before resolving.
- **Sacking & Defense**: Legions defend against cubes added during sacking/revolt.
- **Chain Reaction Sacking**: Do not sack a city twice from the same Barbarian card.
- **Role Sharing (Solitaire)**: 3 roles share one hand; use green pawn to track turn order.
- **Treasury (Solitaire)**: Unlimited storage; Plot allows deposit/withdraw of matching City cards.
- **Roma Caput Mundi Variant**: Legions cannot enter Roma. Adding a barbarian to Roma moves Decline marker instead.
