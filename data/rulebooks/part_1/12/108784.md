## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The Ascension Campaign is a persistent, multi-game experience where players embark on Major and Side Quests to earn points, unlock powerful abilities, and ultimately achieve victory. The overarching goal is to be the first player to reach 150 Campaign Points through in-game achievements, quest completion, and strategic play across multiple Ascension games.

2. Components  
- Standard Ascension game components (core set or compatible edition)  
- Campaign Score Sheet (one per player)  
- Quest cards (Major and Side Quests)  
- Honor tokens (including external supply)  
- Rune tokens (for certain quests)  
- Soul Gems (if included in base game)  

3. Setup  
- Each player receives a Campaign Score Sheet.  
- At the start of the campaign, no quests are active.  
- Players begin with their standard Ascension starting deck unless modified by a quest.  
- Choose a first game of Ascension to begin the campaign.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Before each game:  
   - Review active quests and apply their persistent effects.  
   - Apply any "from the next game" benefits unlocked in prior sessions.  
2. During the game:  
   - Play a standard game of Ascension with all normal rules.  
   - Track achievements completed during the game (e.g., defeating high-power foes, acquiring specific card types).  
   - Check off completed achievements on the Campaign Score Sheet.  
3. After the game:  
   - Calculate total Points:  
     - Standard Awards (as defined in base game or campaign rules)  
     - Dishonorable Acts (if applicable)  
     - Underlined achievements performed during the game  
   - Record total Points on the Campaign Score Sheet.  
   - Unlock new quest benefits if achievement conditions were met.  
   - Proceed to the next game in the campaign.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Persistent Quest Effects**: Once a quest achievement is checked, its benefit applies starting from the *next* game.  
- **Honor from Outside the Pool**: Some quests grant extra honor not taken from the game’s honor pool.  
- **Deck Modifications at Start**: Certain quests allow replacing Apprentices or adding cards to the starting deck or discard pile.  
- **Rune Currency**: Some quests grant Runes usable only for specific acquisitions.  
- **Conditional Card Effects**: Some abilities trigger only when acquiring cards of specific factions (Void, Enlightened, Lifebound, Mechana).  
- **Event Interactions**: If an Event card is in play, certain abilities treat it as belonging to a faction (e.g., Void Event, Enlightened Event).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Players accumulate Points over multiple games.  
- Points come from:  
  - Standard Awards (e.g., most constructs, most heroes)  
  - Dishonorable Acts (e.g., most banished cards)  
  - Specific underlined achievements completed during the game  
- The first player to reach **150 Points** wins the campaign.  
- Alternative: If a sudden win is undesirable, replace **Coalition Victory** (Quest 4) with a 30-point award instead of an immediate win.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Do quest benefits stack?**  
  A: Yes, unless they conflict. Multiple faction-based acquisition bonuses can coexist.  
- **Q: When does “from the next game” take effect?**  
  A: The benefit applies starting in the game *after* the achievement is checked. It does not affect the current game.  
- **Q: Can I use external honor at any time?**  
  A: Only when a quest specifically grants it and allows immediate use. Honor is typically granted at the time the condition is met.  
- **Q: How are random cards determined (e.g., for Elective Affinities)?**  
  A: Randomly select from available cards in the appropriate faction with cost within the specified limit.  
- **Q: Can I trigger multiple “once per round” abilities?**  
  A: Yes, as long as they are from different quests and have different triggers.  
- **Q: What happens if a card is banished via Emri’s Battle Gear?**  
  A: The card is removed from the game (banished), not placed in discard.  
- **Q: Does “start the game with” mean hand or deck?**  
  A: Cards placed in the discard pile at start begin there; others (e.g., Fanatic) are added to the starting deck.
