## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Quarto is a strategic two-player game originally invented by Blaise Müller in 1989. The version described here, *SET Quarto*, adapts the gameplay using cards from the SET® card game. The core objective remains unchanged: be the first player to create a line of four cards sharing at least one common property (Number, Color, Filling, or Form), known as a "Quarto", and call "Quarto!" to win.

The game emphasizes logic, spatial reasoning, and foresight. It is notable for its elegant symmetry: players do not choose which card they place; instead, they give a card to their opponent, who must play it. This unique mechanic forces players to think carefully about both board positioning and piece characteristics.

### 2. Components  
- A standard SET® deck (used partially)  
- 16 SET® cards selected based on specific criteria (see Setup)  
- Optional: 16 unused SET® cards to serve as a physical board (placed face-down in a 4×4 grid)

Note: No additional components (dice, tokens, etc.) are required.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Prepare the Deck**: From the full SET® deck, select only the 16 cards that **do not** have any of the following features:  
   - Number: Three  
   - Color: Blue  
   - Filling: Striped  
   - Form: Wave (or Squiggle, depending on edition)  
   This leaves cards with:  
   - Number: One or Two  
   - Color: Red or Green  
   - Filling: Solid or Empty  
   - Form: Oval or Diamond  

   Each combination of these values yields exactly 16 unique cards (2⁴ = 16), forming the complete Quarto deck.

2. **Prepare the Board (Optional)**: Use 16 other unused SET® cards, placed face-down in a 4×4 grid. These represent the playing fields. Players will place their cards face-up on top of these.

3. **Lay Out Available Cards**: Place the 16 prepared playing cards face-up in two columns of eight, adjacent to the board.

4. **Determine First Player**: Decide randomly or by mutual agreement who goes first.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players alternate turns. On each turn:

1. **Select a Card**: The current player chooses **one** card from the available pool (face-up cards outside the board).
2. **Give to Opponent**: The selected card is handed to the opponent.
3. **Place the Card**: The opponent places the given card face-up on **any empty field** of the 4×4 board.

Once a card is placed on the board, it cannot be moved.

A player may win during their turn **only if they complete a Quarto by placing the fourth card** in a line. However, if a player fails to call "Quarto!" after completing such a line, the **opponent may immediately call "Quarto!" and win**, provided they notice it before making their move.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Properties of Cards  
Each card has four binary properties:
- **Number**: One or Two  
- **Color**: Red or Green  
- **Filling**: Solid or Empty  
- **Form**: Oval or Diamond  

A **Quarto** is formed when **four cards in a line** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) share **at least one** of these properties.

Example: Four cards all showing “Red” form a Quarto, regardless of other attributes.

#### Winning Condition  
- A player wins by **completing a Quarto line** and **calling "Quarto!"** before the opponent acts.
- If a Quarto is formed but not called, the **opponent can steal the win** by calling it first.
- If neither player calls it, the Quarto is **lost** and ignored for the rest of the game.

#### Draw Condition  
The game ends in a draw if:
- The board is full (all 16 cards placed), and
- No valid Quarto has been called.

It is mathematically possible to reach a full board with **no Quarto present**, even under extended winning patterns (see Variants).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win**: First player to successfully call "Quarto!" after completing a line wins.
- **Loss**: A player who completes a Quarto but fails to call it may lose if the opponent calls it first.
- **Draw**: If the board fills without a called Quarto, the game is a draw.

There is no scoring system; each game results in a win, loss, or draw.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can a single line satisfy multiple Quarto conditions?**  
A: Yes. For example, a row could have all Red and all Solid cards. It still counts as one Quarto; multiple shared properties do not change the win condition.

**Q: Can a card be part of more than one Quarto?**  
A: Yes. A single card can contribute to multiple lines (e.g., a row and a diagonal), and multiple Quartos can exist simultaneously.

**Q: What happens if a player accidentally calls "Quarto!" without a valid line?**  
A: The rules do not specify, but standard practice is that the call is invalid, play continues, and the opponent gains a tactical advantage.

**Q: Is optimal play known?**  
A: Yes. Like standard Quarto, SET Quarto can end in a draw with perfect play from both sides.
