### 1. Lore & Objective
Scarface 1920 is set in Chicago during Prohibition (1920–1933), a time of organized crime, corruption, and bootlegging. Players lead one of four gangs—The Chicago Outfit, North Side Mob, Black Wolves Gang, or The Seven Gems—each led by a notorious historical figure (Al Capone, Dean O'Banion, Stephanie St. Clair, or Arnold Rothstein). The objective is to amass the most wealth by controlling neighborhoods, running illegal businesses, and managing criminal operations. The game ends when the "Prohibition Ends at Last!" News card is revealed, and the player with the most money wins.
