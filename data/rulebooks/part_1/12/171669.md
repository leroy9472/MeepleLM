## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
The game simulates exploration and interaction with Native American tribes during a historical expedition. Players take on the role of explorers seeking to document discoveries, gather knowledge, and establish relationships with tribes. The goal is to score the most victory points (VP) by exploring Discovery cards, collecting sets of species, and earning tepees from Tribe cards.

2. **Components**  
- 55-card deck (Tribe and Discovery cards, double-sided)  
- Colored dice (5 per player)  
- Gray neutral dice (6, 8, or 10 depending on player count)  
- Camp board (with Left and Right banks)  
- Player boards  
- Journal covers (score cards, with side indicating player count)  

3. **Setup**  
- **Card and Die Count by Players**:  
  - 2 players: 30 cards, 6 gray dice  
  - 3 players: 40 cards, 8 gray dice  
  - 4 players: 50 cards, 10 gray dice  
- Remove excess cards and gray dice randomly.  
- Shuffle remaining deck and place near board, **Discoveries side up**.  
- Place gray dice in a neutral pool near the Meeting Area.  
- Draw 3 Tribe cards and place face-up on the **left side** of the board (Meeting Area).  
- Draw 3 Discovery cards and place face-up on the **right side** of the board (Reconnaissance Area).  
- Each player takes:  
  - A player board  
  - A journal cover (correct side up for player count)  
  - 5 dice of one color  
- Starting player is chosen randomly.  
- Starting player selects one of the 3 face-up Discovery cards and places it in their **Exploration Zone**. Replace it with a new card from the deck. Proceed clockwise until each player has one Discovery card.  
- All players roll their 5 dice and place them in the **Dice Stock** area on their player board.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Play proceeds clockwise. On a turn, a player chooses **one** of two actions:  
- **A. Play Dice** – Use dice from stock to perform actions  
- **B. Rest** – Recover dice from the board  

After actions (if any), replenish Tribe and Discovery cards to 3 each if needed. Turn ends.

5. **Core Mechanics**  

**A. Play Dice**  
- Play **only dice showing the same face** this turn. At least one die must be played.  
- Multiple actions may be performed, but each action space may be used only once per turn.  
- Actions are performed in any order.  
- Dice used in actions are placed in the Action Zone (on player board or Tribe cards).  

**Available Actions (One-Turn Actions):**  
- **Take Friendly Tribe**: Discard 1 Negotiate die to the **Journal/Negotiate bank** (right side of Camp board). Take 1 face-up Friendly Tribe card and place it on your player board. Take and roll 1 gray die; place it in your Dice Stock. Cannot use gray die this turn.  
- **Take Wary Tribe**: Discard 2 Negotiate dice to the Journal/Negotiate bank. Take 1 Wary Tribe card and place it on your player board. Take and roll 1 gray die; place in Dice Stock. Cannot use gray die this turn.  
- **Changing the Dice**: Discard 1 die (any type) to the appropriate bank. Then, change 1 or 2 dice from your stock to show the **same face** (you choose the face). These dice cannot be used until next turn.  
- **Change Plans**: Discard 1 die (any type) to a bank. Swap your current Exploration Zone Discovery card with one of the 3 face-up cards in the Reconnaissance Area.  

**Exploration Actions (Usually Multi-Turn):**  
These require placing prerequisite dice (on player board or Tribe cards) and later triggering with a **Journal die**.  
- **Horseback Riding**: Place 1 Horseshoe die. Trigger with 1 Journal die → Explore 2 Rivers.  
- **Hiking**: Place 1 Walk die (counts as one action). One Walk die is discarded immediately. Trigger with 1 Journal die → Explore 3 Rivers.  
- **Mountain Expedition**: Place 3 matching dice (any type). Two are discarded. Trigger with 1 Journal die → Explore 2 Mountains.  
- **Special Efficiency**: With 4 Journal dice, Mountain Expedition can be completed in one turn.  

**Exploration Rules**:  
- Must follow path on Discovery card **from bottom to top**.  
- Must complete **one full path** without splitting or rearranging moves.  
- Leftover movement from one card **cannot** be used on another unless completing a second card **immediately**.  
- **Maximum 2 Discovery cards** may be explored per turn.  
- To explore a second card: Use leftover movement from first card **and** additional actions to fully satisfy second card’s path.  
- If two Discovery cards are explored in one turn, the player takes an **immediate bonus turn**.  

**Using Tribe Cards with Permanent Effects**  
- Cards 1–36: Provide enhanced or alternative exploration actions.  
- Cards 39–42 (Yankton Sioux): Once per turn, treat one die as showing the face shown on the card. Physically rotate the die.  
- Cards 43–46 (Tetons Sioux): Once per turn, treat one die showing the card’s face as if it were the face you chose to play. Rotate die to match.  
- Cards 47–48 (Flathead): Once per turn, you may use **only 2 dice**, and they may show **different faces**. With both Flathead cards, use **3 dice with different faces**.  
- Cards 49–50 (Blackfeet): When determining who has the most gray dice (for gray die acquisition), you are considered to have **one fewer gray die** than actual.  
- Card 51 (Arikara): Ignore tribe type when taking Tribe cards. A Wary tribe costs only 1 Negotiate die. You may take two Tribes of the same type in one turn (e.g., two Friendly or two Wary).  
- Cards 52–53 (Wishram): When Changing the Dice, the 1 or 2 dice changed **do not need to show the same face**.  
- Cards 54–55 (Wanapum): When Changing the Dice, you may change **one additional die** (total of 2 or 3 dice). All changed dice must show the same face **unless** you also have Wishram (52–53).  

**Special Exploration Cards (1–36):**  
- Cards 1–13: More efficient versions of standard exploration actions.  
- Cards 14–21: Explore **X Rivers OR Y Mountains** (choose one).  
- Cards 22–26: Explore **X Rivers THEN Y Mountains** (in order).  
- Cards 27–31: Explore **X Mountains THEN Y Rivers** (in order).  
- Cards 32–33 (Clatsop): When exploring, treat **one River as a Mountain or vice versa** (only one conversion allowed).  
- Card 34 (Tenino): Add **1 River** to a River exploration. Only applies if used with another River action.  
- Card 35 (Multnomah): Add **2 Rivers** to a River exploration. Only applies with another River action.  
- Card 36 (Nez Perce): Add **1 Mountain** to a Mountain exploration. Only applies with another Mountain action.  

**Cards with Immediate Effect**  
- Cards 37–38 (Minnetaree): When acquired, immediately take one of the 3 face-up Discovery cards and place it **on the Minnetaree card**. You may explore this card **instead of** your Exploration Zone card. After exploration, move it to your Journal. Minnetaree card remains empty and **cannot be reused**. If not explored by game end, discard the Discovery card.  

**B. Rest – Recover Dice**  
Choose **one** option:  
1. Take **all dice** (any color) from the **Right bank** of the Camp board.  
2. Take **all dice** (any color) from the **Left bank** of the Camp board.  
3. Take **all or part** of your **colored dice** from **anywhere** (your board, Tribe cards, Camp board, other players’ boards).  
- Roll all recovered dice and place in Dice Stock.  
- Turn ends.  

**Gray Die Acquisition Rule**:  
- If you need a gray die and none are in the neutral pool, the player with the **most gray dice** in their **Stock + Action Zone** must give you one (they choose which).  
- If tied, you choose which player gives it.  
- Gray dice **cannot be used in the same turn** they are acquired.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- **Game End**: When a player **cannot refill** their Exploration Zone (no face-up Discovery card available), their game ends. All other players take **one final turn**.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - **Discovery Cards**: VP shown on each card in your Journal.  
  - **Species Sets**: Collect at least one card of each species type. Score based on number of types:  
    - 1 type: 3 VP  
    - 2 types: 8 VP  
    - 3 types: 15 VP  
    - 4 types: 24 VP  
    - (Deck contains: 7 Plants, 6 Mammals, 5 Birds, 4 Fish)  
  - **Tepees**: Count tepees on **Tribe cards** and **Discovery cards** in your Journal. Rank players:  
    - 2 Players: 1st = 12 VP, 2nd = 6 VP  
    - 3 Players: 1st = 12 VP, 2nd = 6 VP, 3rd = 0 VP  
    - 4 Players: 1st = 12 VP, 2nd = 6 VP, 3rd = 3 VP, 4th = 0 VP  
    - Ties: Combine ranks and split VP equally (e.g., two tied for 1st in 4p: (12+6)/2 = 9 VP each).  

- **Win Condition**: Player with most VP wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Most dice on player board (including Dice Stock, Action Zone, Tribe cards). If still tied, share victory.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can I use a die from my stock immediately after Changing the Dice?**  
  No. Dice changed via "Changing the Dice" action cannot be used until the **next turn**.  
- **Can I explore two Discovery cards in one turn without a bonus turn?**  
  Yes, but only if you have enough actions to complete both. A bonus turn is granted **only if you successfully complete two**.  
- **Can I use Clatsop and Tenino on the same move?**  
  Yes, as long as each effect is applied legally (Clatsop: one River↔Mountain conversion; Tenino: +1 River to a River action).  
- **Can I use Flathead with Tribe card actions that require different die types?**  
  Yes. Flathead allows using fewer dice with different faces, enabling access to multi-type actions.  
- **What happens to Minnetaree if the attached Discovery card is not explored?**  
  Discard the card at game end. The Minnetaree card stays but provides no benefit.  
- **Can I recover my own dice from my Dice Stock during Rest?**  
  No. Option 3 ("Take your dice wherever they are") excludes your Dice Stock.
