## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
'Age of Industry' is a business strategy game set during the 19th-century industrial revolution. Players aim to earn money by building and operating industries such as cotton mills, factories, coal mines, iron works, ports, and ships. The ultimate goal is to accumulate the most victory points (VPs), which are derived from money (every $5 = 1 VP), industry counters on the board (each worth VPs equal to its technology level), and railway profits, minus penalties for outstanding loans.

2. Components  
- 1 double-sided game board (Germany / New England)  
- 5 sets of player counters (red, blue, yellow, green, purple) including:  
  - Cotton mills  
  - Factories  
  - Iron works  
  - Coal mines  
  - Ports  
  - Ships (only one '0' value ship per player)  
  - 12 railway counters per player  
- 66-card deck (industry and location cards)  
- 5 player displays (one per player)  
- 1 turn order token per player  
- 24 loan counters ($10 each)  
- 18 market counters  
- ~30 black coal cubes and ~30 orange iron cubes  
- Plastic money: ~40 gold ($5), ~30 silver ($1)  
- Player order display

3. Setup  
- Choose board side (Germany recommended for first play).  
- Each player selects a color and takes matching counters, player display, and turn order token.  
- Place industry counters on player display in tech-level order (lowest on left); follow display layout for quantity per level.  
- Randomly determine starting player; place turn order tokens clockwise on display.  
- Form bank with money; place loans nearby.  
- Shuffle 66-card deck; deal 6 cards to each player.  
- Place draw pile face down; reveal 2 cards face up beside it.  
- Fill coal and iron demand displays:  
  - Place 1 coal cube per black space on coal demand display  
  - Place 1 iron cube per orange space on iron demand display  
- Shuffle market counters face down; place one on each market space; flip face up (including "No Demand" counters). Return extras to box.  
- New England variant: When building a ship, place coal cubes in connected coal import location after construction.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has three phases:  
1. **Player Actions**  
   - First round: each player takes 1 action.  
   - Subsequent rounds: each player takes 2 actions (can repeat same action).  
   - Actions: Build Industry, Build Railway, Sell Goods, Development, Take Two Cards, Pass.  
   - Players act in turn order.  
   - After actions, place spent money in box next to turn order token.  
2. **Determine New Order of Play**  
   - Reorder players by money spent (least spent = first).  
   - Ties retain relative order.  
   - Return all spent money to bank.  
3. **Pay Interest on Loans**  
   - Pay $1 interest per $10 of outstanding loans.  
   - No interest on a loan taken to pay interest.  
Game ends after a full round when:  
- Draw deck is empty  
- At least one player has no cards in hand  
- Discard pile is not reshuffled  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Building Industry**  
  - Requires playing 1 card (industry or location).  
  - **Industry Card**: Build specified industry type in a location connected to your network.  
  - **Location Card**: Build any legal industry in a location matching card color.  
  - **Wild Build**: Combine both actions to build any legal industry in any legal space using any card.  
  - Must build lowest tech-level available counter of that type.  
  - Tech 0 factories and ships cannot be built; must be removed via Development.  
  - Costs and material requirements (coal/iron) shown on player display.  

- **Network & Connectivity**  
  - A location is part of your network if:  
    - You have an industry there  
    - You have a railway connected to it  
    - It is connected via sea lane to your ship or a location in your network  
  - Sea lanes require:  
    - Port at each end  
    - Ship in intervening space (flipped or not)  
  - Pennsylvania (New England): no transshipment (cannot move in and out immediately).  

- **Coal & Iron Movement**  
  - Required for building certain industries and railways.  
  - Must come from closest source (measured in rail/sea links).  
  - Sources:  
    - Coal mines / iron works (any player)  
    - Demand display (if connected to port or distant port symbol)  
  - Cost to take from demand display: pay amount shown on cheapest available row; if empty, $4 per cube.  
  - When building coal mine/iron works:  
    - Place cubes as shown under counter on display  
    - If connected to port/distant port and demand display has space, move cubes to display (fill cheapest first) and collect payment  
    - This only occurs at moment of construction  

- **Overbuilding**  
  - Can overbuild own counters (same space) if new counter is higher tech level and legal for space.  
  - Can overbuild opponent’s coal mine or iron works only if:  
    - No coal/iron cubes on map or in demand display  
    - New counter is same type and higher tech level  
  - Overbuilt counter is removed from game (not returned to display).  
  - Overbuilding a ship: do not refill coal, do not reset market, do not flip.  

- **Building Railways**  
  - Place one railway counter on a link between two locations.  
  - Must connect to your network at one end.  
  - First railway: $1  
  - Subsequent railways: $1 + 1 coal + 1 iron (moved to either end)  

- **Selling Goods**  
  - Action: Sell from one or more cotton mills/factories.  
  - Must be connected (rail/sea) to unused port or market.  
  - Flip both industry and destination (port/market).  
  - Level 1 ports accept only cotton; higher-level ports accept both.  
  - Market must match good type (cotton/factory).  
  - Owner of industry and port (if applicable) collects profit immediately.  

- **Flipping Counters**  
  - Cotton mills / factories: when sold via port/market  
  - Ports: when used for sale  
  - Coal mines / iron works: when last cube is removed  
  - Ships: when all coal is taken and connected market is flipped  
  - Flip immediately; collect profit from player display  

- **Development**  
  - Discard 1 card to remove any counter from your display (permanently).  
  - Only leftmost (lowest tech) counters can be developed.  
  - Required to remove tech 0 factories and ships.  

- **Take Two Cards**  
  - Draw 2 cards from face-up display and/or draw deck.  
  - Replace face-up cards immediately.  
  - Max hand size: 9 cards.  

- **Pass**  
  - Discard 1 card (unless no cards and no deck).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Railway Profits**:  
  - Each railway earns $2 + $1 per occupied space at each end  
  - Occupied spaces: any industry counter, market (flipped or not), village  
- **Repay Loans**: Pay back any amount possible.  
- **Convert Money to VPs**:  
  - Divide remaining money by 5 → VPs (e.g., $23 = 4 VPs)  
  - Return excess money to bank; use money to track VPs  
- **Score Industry Counters**:  
  - Each counter on board = VPs equal to tech level (flipped or not)  
- **Loan Penalty**:  
  - Lose 5 VPs per $10 of outstanding loans  
- **Winner**: Highest VP total. Tiebreaker: higher position in turn order.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use opponent’s railways?** Yes, for movement and connectivity.  
- **Can I sell through opponent’s port?** Yes, no permission needed.  
- **Can I build a port without coal/iron if required?** Yes, can take from demand display if connected to port/distant port.  
- **When do cubes go to demand display?** Only when building coal mine/iron works or ship (if connected).  
- **Can I use cubes from a just-built mine for my build?** Yes, if the mine is connected and cubes are moved to demand display.  
- **What if I can’t pay interest?** Take a loan; no interest on that loan.  
- **Can I overbuild a port with a cotton mill?** No; must match space type.  
- **Do flipped counters count for railway scoring?** Yes, as occupied spaces.  
- **Can I develop a counter I just built?** No, only counters on display.  
- **Can I pass without a card?** Only if no cards in hand and no draw deck.
