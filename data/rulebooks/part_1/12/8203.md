## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Hey! That’s My Fish! is a strategic tile-laying and movement game where players control penguins foraging across a fragmented arctic ice sheet. The objective in the base game is to collect the most fish by moving penguins across ice floes and removing them from the board. Variants introduce alternate goals such as survival, cooperation, or chaotic tile effects.

### 2. Components  
- Hexagonal ice floe tiles with 1, 2, or 3 fish (standard set)  
- Penguin player tokens (color-coded)  
- Optional variant components:  
  - Killer whale token (Roaming Danger)  
  - Hidden whale stickers (Hidden Danger)  
  - Special tiles: teleportation, exchange, broken (I & II), reversal, floating ice  
  - Scorekeeping tools (for Group Effort)  

### 3. Setup  
#### Base Game Setup  
- Shuffle all ice floe tiles face down, then arrange them face up into 8 alternating rows: 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8 tiles (total ~121 tiles).  
- Players choose colors and receive penguins:  
  - 2 players: 4 penguins each  
  - 3 players: 3 penguins each  
  - 4 players: 2 penguins each  
- Players take turns placing one penguin on any empty 1-fish tile.  

#### Variant Setups  
**VARIANT SETUP #1**  
- Use red-lettered side of tiles.  
- Ignore bright blue hexes.  
- Cover dark blue hexes.  

**VARIANT SETUP #2**  
- Use purple-lettered side of tiles.  
- Central dark blue hex is either impassable, always passable, or may be covered with a 0 or -2 tile.  

**OFFICIAL VARIANT (Cornett & Jakeliunas)**  
- All standard rules apply.  
- A penguin may "push" an adjacent opponent’s penguin into the water if there is a gap or board edge directly behind it in a straight line. The pushing penguin moves onto the vacated tile; the pushed penguin is removed. The original tile is not removed.

**4-PLAYER CO-OPERATIVE (ludopath)**  
- 4 players, 2 teams of 2.  
- Each player controls 2 penguins of their color.  
- Turns alternate between teams.  
- Team score is the sum of both teammates’ collected fish.  

**ROAMING DANGER (jeRm!)**  
- Add a killer whale token starting on the central 3-fish tile.  
- After moving a penguin, move the whale straight forward a number of spaces equal to the fish on the tile just vacated.  
- Whale stops at board edges or when landing on a penguin (which is then removed).  
- A player cannot lose their last penguin to the whale.  

**HIDDEN DANGER (The Warp)**  
- Attach killer whale stickers to the back of one 3-fish tile (and optionally one 2-fish tile).  
- When a penguin moves off a tile with a hidden whale, discard the tile and remove the penguin.  

**SURVIVAL VARIANT (nnf1's son)**  
- Goal: Have the most penguins remaining on the board.  
- Setup: Place penguins anywhere (fish count irrelevant).  
- Movement: Penguins move one tile at a time in straight lines.  
- After moving, remove any empty tile with the same fish count as the destination.  
- A penguin unable to move is removed.  
- Game ends when no player can affect connected ice areas.  
- Winner: Most penguins remaining. Tiebreaker: Most fish on remaining tiles.  

**GROUP EFFORT (RichardV)**  
- Penguins may share tiles.  
- Move one or all penguins from a tile as a group.  
- Tile is removed only when fully vacated.  
- Score = (fish on tile) × (number of penguins leaving).  
- Setup: No more than one penguin per 1-fish tile at start.  

**NEW TILES (Ludivers variant)**  
- **Teleportation Tile (1x2-fish, 3x1-fish):** Teleport to any tile of same fish value.  
- **Exchange Tile (2x2-fish, 2x1-fish):** Swap with opponent’s penguin on tile of same fish value.  
- **Broken Tile (double-sided I & II):** Cannot stop on it. Passing over breaks it further. II becomes I; I breaks completely.  
- **Reversal Tile:** Force opponent to return their lowest-value collected tile to the board adjacent to your penguin.  
- **Floating Ice Tile:** Move any edge tile to reconnect or extend the board.  
- All special tiles are discarded when vacated.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Starting Player:** Youngest player begins; play proceeds clockwise.  
2. **Player Turn:**  
   a. **Move:** Choose one penguin. Move in a straight line any distance, stopping before gaps, penguins, or edges.  
   b. **Remove Tile:** Pick up the tile the penguin started on.  
3. **End of Turn:** If playing with variants, trigger special effects (e.g., move whale, use special tile).  
4. **Pass or Out:** If no legal moves, player is out. Remove all their penguins and tiles they occupy.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Movement:**  
  - Straight line only.  
  - Cannot change direction.  
  - Cannot jump gaps or penguins.  
  - Must stop when blocked.  
- **Tile Removal:**  
  - Tile under starting penguin is removed after move.  
  - Cannot move onto removed or occupied tiles.  
- **Isolation:**  
  - If a penguin cannot move, it is out of the game.  
  - In variants, isolated penguins may remain until end.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Base Game:**  
  - Game ends when all penguins are out.  
  - Score = total fish on collected tiles.  
  - Tiebreakers:  
    1. Most tiles collected.  
    2. Shared victory if still tied.  
- **Group Effort:** Score = sum of (fish × penguins) per vacated tile.  
- **Survival Variant:** Winner has most penguins remaining; tiebreaker = fish on remaining tiles.  
- **Cooperative:** Team score = sum of both players’ fish.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move zero spaces?** No. Movement must be at least one tile.  
- **Can I move over my own penguin?** No. Penguins block movement regardless of color.  
- **What if the killer whale has no valid path?** It does not move (Roaming Danger).  
- **Can I use a reversal tile if opponent has no tiles?** No. Effect cannot be resolved.  
- **Can I float a tile to connect isolated sections?** Yes, if it’s an edge tile and movement is valid.  
- **Do broken tiles count as gaps?** Yes. They cannot be landed on and break after being passed over.  
- **Can I push an opponent into the water if it’s their last penguin?** Yes, unless variant restricts it (e.g., Roaming Danger).
