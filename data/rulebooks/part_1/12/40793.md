## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
You are in the Wild Wild West, where gold, land, and power draw pioneers to Dice Town. The objective is to become the most influential figure by accumulating Victory Points (VP) through gold nuggets, dollars, property claims, equipment cards, and holding the Sheriff Badge at game end.

2. Components  
- 1 Game board  
- 5 Dice cups  
- 25 Poker dice (5 per player)  
- 43 $1 bills  
- 30 Gold nuggets  
- 19 General Store cards  
- 25 Property Claim cards  
- 1 Sheriff Badge card with stand  
- Optional expansion components (River cards, Outlaw cards, Ranch cards, Indian die, Cowboy cards, Rodeo cards, Cow figures, Prairie board)

3. Setup  
- Place the board.  
- Shuffle General Store cards and form a face-down deck above the General Store.  
- Shuffle Property Claim cards, place face-down deck above Town Hall, and reveal the top 3 face-up.  
- Place all 30 gold nuggets on the Gold Mine.  
- Place $3 on the Bank space.  
- Give each player: 1 cup, 5 dice, $8.  
- Youngest player (or random) receives the Sheriff Badge.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of two phases:  
Phase 1: Poker Hand Phase  
- All players simultaneously roll 5 dice in their cup, hidden from view.  
- Each player secretly looks under the cup, keeps 1 die under it, and takes the rest into hand.  
- Players simultaneously reveal the kept die and place it in front of them ("locked").  
- Repeat with remaining dice (placing into cup, rolling, keeping one).  
- Players may keep more than one die per roll: for each die beyond the first, pay $1 per extra die to the Stagecoach.  
- A player may choose to keep no die: this costs $1 to the Stagecoach.  
- If any player finishes their 5-dice hand early, all others get one final roll with remaining dice and must keep the result (no cost, even if multiple dice are kept).  

Phase 2: Action Phase  
After all hands are revealed, resolve locations in this order:  
1. Gold Mine  
2. Bank  
3. Stagecoach  
4. General Store  
5. Saloon  
6. Sheriff  
7. Town Hall  
8. Doc Badluck  

In case of a tie at any location, the current Sheriff decides the winner. Bribes are allowed.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Gold Mine**: Player with the most 9s takes 1 nugget per 9.  
- **Bank**: Player with the most 10s takes all money on the Bank.  
- **Stagecoach**: No player wins. Move all money from Stagecoach to Bank.  
- **General Store**: Player with the most Jacks draws as many cards as Jacks rolled, keeps one, discards the rest face-down. Reshuffle discard if deck runs out. In Round 1, winner performs this action twice.  
- **Saloon**: Player with the most Queens chooses one opponent and takes as many cards (General Store or Property) as Queens rolled, keeps one, returns the rest.  
- **Sheriff**: Player with the most Kings takes the Sheriff Badge. Badge grants tie-breaking authority and is worth 5 VP at game end.  
- **Town Hall**: Player with the best poker hand (ranked: 5 of a kind > 4 of a kind > Full House > Straight > 3 of a kind > 2 pair > 1 pair > High card) takes the bottom-most face-up Property Claim. For each Ace in hand, takes one additional face-up claim (max 3). Remaining face-up cards slide down; refill from deck to 3.  
- **Doc Badluck**: Any player who did not win a reward this round (even if they won a location but received nothing of value) may use Doc Badluck. Choose one action based on dice rolled:  
  - 9 or 10: Protect up to 2 Property Claims in hand by placing them face-up in front of you (immune to theft).  
  - J or Q: Draw and keep 1 General Store card.  
  - K: All other players give you $2 (or $1 if they have only $1).  
  - A: All other players give you 1 gold nugget (if able).  
  - If multiple players use Doc Badluck, Sheriff decides resolution order.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends at the end of any round where:  
- All gold nuggets are taken from the Gold Mine, OR  
- All Property Claim cards are taken (no more in deck or face-up).  

Victory Points are scored as:  
- 1 VP per gold nugget  
- 1 VP per $2 (round down)  
- 5 VP for holding the Sheriff Badge  
- VP from Property Claim cards (value printed)  
- VP from General Store equipment cards (value printed)  

Tiebreaker:  
1. Most Property Claim cards  
2. Sheriff decides  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: If I win the Bank but it's empty, can I go to Doc Badluck?  
  A: Yes, if you earned nothing of value.  
- Q: If I win a General Store card but it's stolen in the Saloon, can I use Doc Badluck?  
  A: No — you earned something, even if lost.  
- Q: Tie for best poker hand at Town Hall?  
  A: Compare hand strength (e.g., 4 Kings > 4 Jacks). For Full House, compare triple first, then pair. For straights, Ace-high beats non-Ace-high. If identical, Sheriff decides.  
- Q: Can multiple players use Doc Badluck?  
  A: Yes. Sheriff decides order of resolution.  
- Q: Is Doc Badluck used in 2–3 player games?  
  A: Rarely, but possible. Normal if never visited.  
- Q: Can I bribe the Sheriff?  
  A: Yes — with money, nuggets, or cards.
