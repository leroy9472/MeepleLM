### 1. Lore & Objective
The kingdom is in grave danger as acolytes conspire to resurrect the vile Unhallowed. As four mighty adventurers, players must secure nine locations to prevent the breaking of ancient seals. The objective is to survive five rounds of combat, defeat creatures, manage resources, and prevent the Unhallowed from rising. Victory is achieved by completing all five rounds with at least one adventurer having an unexhausted ability at the end of the final round.

### 2. Components
- 4 adventurer cards  
- 1 camp card  
- 1 location card  
- 12 creature cards (each with two creatures)  
- 6d8 dice  
- 6d6 dice  
- 9 blue cubes (8 for tracking blue adventurer abilities, 1 for future location tracking)  
- 9 red cubes (8 for tracking red adventurer abilities, 1 for horde tracking)  
- 2 yellow cubes (1 for tracking current round, 1 for firewood)  
- 1 green cube (for tracking current location)

### 3. Setup
1. **Camp Card Setup**  
   - Place the camp card within reach.  
   - Place a yellow cube on "1" to indicate round 1.  
   - Place another yellow cube on "7" in the firewood tracker.  
   - Place a red cube on "0" on the horde tracker.

2. **Location Card Setup**  
   - Place the location card nearby.  
   - Roll a d8 to determine the first location (reroll 8s, as the Forbidden Tower is only for round 5).  
   - Place a green cube on the selected location.  
   - If a future location is predetermined (via camp action), place a blue cube on it.

3. **Adventurer Selection**  
   - Each player selects an adventurer and takes 3 corresponding dice (d6 for red characters, d8 for blue).  
   - Each adventurer starts with 3 equipped abilities: 2 refreshed (cube on full shield), 1 exhausted (cube on slashed shield).  
   - The remaining 2 abilities are not equipped and do not receive cubes.  
   - Place a cube on the tent icon of the special camp action to indicate the adventurer has not rested.

4. **Creature Deck Preparation**  
   - Shuffle all 12 creature cards (rotating some 180° for variety).  
   - Set the deck near the location card.

5. **Player Count Adjustments**  
   - 4 players: Each controls one adventurer.  
   - 3 players: One player controls a flex adventurer during the watch phase.  
   - 2 players: Each controls two adventurers.  
   - 1 player: Controls all four adventurers.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round follows this sequence:
1. **Determine Next Location** (roll d8, reroll duplicates or 8 until valid)
2. **Roll Dice** (all players roll their dice)
3. **Camp Phase** (one adventurer rests, uses dice for camp actions)
4. **Watch Phase** (remaining adventurers battle creatures)
5. **End Round** (clear line, advance location, repeat)

**Final Round (Round 5):**  
- All adventurers go on watch (no rest).  
- The horde is added to the creature line.  
- Exhausting an ability can increase firewood by 2 at any time.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Camp Phase Actions**  
  The resting adventurer assigns dice to:
  - **Chop Wood** (max 3): +2 firewood per die.
  - **Scout Ahead** (max 3): Look at top 2 creature cards, rearrange, return to top/bottom. Each additional die must be higher than the previous.
  - **Check Map** (max 1): Roll d8 twice, choose one unvisited location as next. Requires die ≥4. Cannot change final location.
  - **Heal** (max 1): Refresh one exhausted ability. Requires die = 6.
  - **Equip** (max 1): Swap one equipped ability with an unequipped one. Exhausted status carries over.
  - **Special Camp Action**: Unique per adventurer, used once per game when resting.
  - **Rune Actions** (require doubles or triples):
    - **Seal**: Swap an active Unhallowed with one from the graveyard.
    - **Vanquish**: Reduce horde by 1.
    - **Bolster**: All on-watch adventurers may reroll any number of dice.

- **Watch Phase**  
  - **Set Up Line**: Draw face-down creature cards equal to the current location’s creature count.
  - **Reveal Creatures**: Reveal number of creatures based on firewood level (7 = 2 revealed, 12 = 3, etc.), starting from the front.
  - **Combat Actions**:
    - **Direct Attacks**: Combine dice to meet or exceed a revealed creature’s health. Melee adventurers (sword icon) can only attack first position; ranged (bow icon) can attack first or second.
    - **Abilities**: Spend a die on an unexhausted ability to activate it once. Alternatively, exhaust the ability (without spending a die) to activate it. An ability can be used twice in a round: once with a die, once by exhaustion.
    - **Passive Abilities**: Do not require dice or exhaustion; use as described (some limited to once per round).

- **Unhallowed Activation**  
  - Each Unhallowed has a skull number. When revealed, if the skull number matches the current round, rotate the card so the Unhallowed is on top and must be faced.
  - When an Unhallowed activates this way, exhaust one adventurer ability of your choice (unless activated by Acolyte’s power).

- **Damage & Exhaustion**  
  - If a creature is not defeated, it goes to the graveyard and increases the horde by 1.
  - Exhaust a number of abilities equal to the creature’s damage value, chosen from adventurers on watch.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: Survive all 5 rounds with at least one unexhausted ability among the adventurers after the final battle.
- **Lose Conditions**:
  - All adventurers on watch have all abilities exhausted at the end of any round.
  - Firewood reaches 0 and no ability can be exhausted to increase it.
  - (Note: Unlike original, no Unhallowed deck depletion loss condition.)

**Final Round Specifics**:
- The horde lengthens the creature line.
- If the deck runs out, defeated creatures are rotated, shuffled, and added to the end of the line while reducing the horde tracker.
- Creatures sent to the horde during the final round do not extend the line.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Unhallowed Activation**: Only skull number matching current round triggers ability exhaustion (not Acolyte-triggered).
- **Creature Deck**: Shuffle graveyard back into deck every round.
- **Rerolling Location**: Reroll d8 if result is 8 or a previously visited location.
- **Ability Usage**: An ability can be used twice—once with a die, once by exhaustion.
- **Firewood at 0**: Must exhaust an ability to gain +2 firewood immediately.
- **Adventurer Exhaustion**: An adventurer cannot participate in watch if all abilities are exhausted at the start.
- **Final Round Horde**: Use horde tracker to manage overflow; defeated creatures cycle back into line until horde is clear.
