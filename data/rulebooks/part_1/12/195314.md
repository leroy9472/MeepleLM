Expand your garden experience with a full-flavored mode for larger groups. By combining two copies of *Herbaceous*, players gather herbs, plant them wisely, and score points by filling containers with matching herbs. The goal is to earn the most points by the end of the game.

**The King's Gardener (Solo Variant)**  
You, an aspiring gardener, challenge Herbaceous—the current Royal Gardener—in a 10-round contest of wits and strategy. Using tactical planting and potting, you must outscore the AI gardener to win the King’s favor.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

#### General Turn Order (Multiplayer)
Each turn:
1. **Draw** a card from either Deck 1 or 2.
2. **Plant** the drawn card into:
   - Your Private Garden
   - Community Garden
   - Discard Pile  
   (Only one location per turn.)
3. **Pot Herbs (Optional)**  
   - Use matching herbs from your **Private Garden** to fill one of your containers.
   - Follow container rules (e.g., 4 of a kind in Large Pot).
   - Only **one container** may be potted per turn.

> Play proceeds clockwise. When a deck is exhausted, draw from the other.

#### Game End (Multiplayer)
- Game ends when **both draw decks are exhausted**.
- Final turn: All players get one last action (draw, plant, optional pot).
- Proceed to **Scoring**.

#### Solo Variant: Turn Structure (10 Rounds)
Each round has two phases:

##### Phase 1: Solo Player (SP) Turn
1. **Pot Herbs (Optional)**  
   - Follow base game rules.
   - Only **one container** per turn.
2. **Plant (Required)**  
   - Take the **top face-down pile of 6 cards**.
     - Keep first 3 face-down.
     - Place remaining 3 face-down in **AI’s Private Garden area** (for AI’s use next turn).
   - Reveal first 2 cards → choose which to play in:
     - SP Private Garden
     - Community Garden
     - Discard Pile
   - Reveal 3rd card → now with 2 revealed cards, assign one each to the two remaining locations.

##### Phase 2: AI (Al) Turn

**1. Pot Herbs (AI)**
- AI may pot **even in partially filled containers**.
- May pot **multiple herbs at once**, but only **one container per turn**.
- Priority Order:
  1. Left to right across containers.
  2. For SH1-type herbs: Use **AI’s Private Garden first**, then **Community Garden**.
  3. If no SH1 available, move to next container.

**Special Rules for Large Pot (Blue) with SH1:**
- Each time AI **pots an SH1**, score value **decreases by 2**, from 22 → 20 → 18 → 16 → 14.
- At **5 SH1s potted**, score starts **increasing** (+2 per additional SH1): 14 → 16 → 18 → 20 → 22.
- Score **never drops below 14**.

**Glass Jar (Special Herbs):**
- AI attempts to collect 3 different Special Herbs (values 1, 2, 3).
- Priority:
  - Take highest-value Special Herb from gardens.
  - If same value, take from **Community Garden first**.
  - If all 3 types present, take all and claim **Herb Biscuit** if available.
  - If none in gardens:
    - Search **Discard Pile** (top-down).
    - If still none, search **Draw Pile** (top-down), then **shuffle remainder** into new Draw Pile.

> AI follows base rule: First to complete Glass Jar with 3 different Special Herbs **immediately claims Herb Biscuit**.

**2. Plant (AI)**
- AI uses the **3 face-down cards** placed in its Private Garden area during SP’s turn.
- Reveals one at a time.
- Places **one card each** into:
  - AI’s Private Garden
  - Community Garden
  - Discard Pile  
  (Player chooses order.)

### 5. Core Mechanics

- **Potting**: Convert matching herbs into container points.
  - Large Pot: 4 of a kind
  - Wooden Planter: 3 of a kind
  - Small Pots: 2 pairs
  - Glass Jar: 3 different Special Herbs
- **One Container Per Turn**: Only one container may be potted per player per turn.
- **Herb Biscuit**: Awarded to first player (or AI) to complete the Glass Jar. Worth **3 points**.
- **Community Garden**: Shared space; any player may draw from it for potting.
- **Discard Pile**: Cards here may be retrieved by AI in solo mode.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Multiplayer
- Game ends when **both draw decks are exhausted**.
- Players score:
  - **Large Pot**: 22 → 14 points (based on how many herbs potted)
  - **Wooden Planter**: 3 of a kind = 15 pts
  - **Small Pots**: 2 pairs = 12 pts
  - **Glass Jar**: 3 different Special Herbs = 10 pts + **Herb Biscuit (3 pts)** if earned
- Highest total wins.

#### Solo Variant
- After 10 rounds, proceed to scoring.
- **Extra Potting Action**:
  - After final round, if SP has an **empty container**, may pot one last time.
  - AI may **complete one of first three containers** if not full, following left-to-right priority.

**Final Scoring**:
- Follow base game scoring rules.
- SP wins if **score > AI**.
- **Tiebreaker**:
  1. Compare **Large Pot (Blue)** scores.
  2. If still tied, **AI wins**.

**Last Round AI Rule**:
- At start of **10th AI turn**, if **Glass Jar is incomplete**, AI **must complete it**:
  - Take needed Special Herbs from:
    - Gardens (priority: Community → Private)
    - Discard Pile (top-down)
    - Draw Pile (top-down, then reshuffle)
  - May take **multiple cards** if needed.
- If already complete, AI pots normally.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

**Q: Can I pot from the Community Garden?**  
A: Yes, you may use herbs from your **Private Garden** and the **Community Garden** to pot, but only one container per turn.

**Q: What happens if one deck runs out?**  
A: Continue drawing from the other. Game ends only when **both decks are empty**.

**Q: Can two players have the same color markers?**  
A: Yes. It’s expected in 5–8 player games and useful in Team Variant.

**Q: How does AI handle virtual SH1?**  
A: The AI treats SH1 as already present in Wooden Planter and Small Pots. It cannot physically plant them there, but they count toward completion.

**Q: What if AI needs a Special Herb not in play?**  
A: It may retrieve from **Discard**, then **Draw Pile**. After retrieval, shuffle remaining draw cards.

**Q: Does SP go first every round in solo mode?**  
A: Yes. Turn order is fixed: SP → AI, repeated for 10 rounds.

**Q: Can AI pot multiple containers in one turn?**  
A: No. Only **one container per turn**, though it may add multiple herbs to an already started container.
