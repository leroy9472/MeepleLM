## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Each player guides multiple empires across history in *History of the World* (Hasbro 2001 edition), from ancient civilizations to modern nations. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) over seven Epochs (rounds) by controlling capitals, cities, monuments, seas, and achieving regional dominance across the globe. Civilizations rise and fall, and players adapt strategies with each new empire they lead.

The player with the highest VP total at the end of Epoch VII wins.

- Colored player pieces: Armies, Fleets, Forts, Capital tokens, Monument tokens  
- Double-sided Empire cards (organized by Epoch)  
- Event cards (by color, including Sumeria)  
- VP track with markers  
- Strength markers  
- Dice: white (attacker), black (defender)  
- Pre-eminence markers (used optionally)

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board in the center. Each player takes all pieces of one color and places:
   - Their VP marker at 0 on the VP track
   - Their Strength marker (I Army) at 0 on the VP track
2. Event Cards:
   - Place the white Sumeria Event card face-up beside the board.
   - Sort remaining Event cards by color, shuffle each pile, and place face-down near the board.
   - Each player draws one card from each color pile (9 total). Remaining cards are removed from the game.
3. Empire Cards:
   - Sort by Epoch (I to VII).
   - Shuffle each Epoch deck separately, then stack them with Epoch I on top and Epoch VII on bottom.
4. Determine First Player:
   - All players roll both dice; highest roll goes first (re-roll ties).
5. Set Up Sumeria:
   - The first player takes 4 white Sumeria tokens and 1 Capital token.
   - Places 1 Sumeria token and the Capital token in Lower Tigris.
   - Places the remaining 3 Sumeria tokens in or adjacent to any region containing a Sumeria token (max 3 per region).
   - This player controls Sumeria for defense and retreats only; does not score for them.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 7 rounds (Epochs). Each Epoch proceeds as follows:

#### A. Empire Distribution  
- Order: Begins with the player with the lowest Strength rating. Ties broken by:
  1. Most VP
  2. Lowest Empire card number from previous round
- Each player, in turn:
  - Draws the top Empire card and looks at it secretly.
  - May keep it (if no card already kept) or pass it face-down to another player (who doesn’t already have one).
- Once all players have a card, they reveal them.
- Any leftover cards from the current Epoch are removed from the game.

#### B. Player Actions (by Empire Card Number)  
Players take turns in ascending order of their revealed Empire card numbers (e.g., 1, then 2, etc.). Missing numbers are skipped.

Each turn has 6 phases:

##### Phase 1: Play 'Start-of-Turn' Event Cards (Optional)  
- May play up to 2 Event cards now.
- Cards labeled “play during turn” can be played at any time during the turn.
- No more than 2 Event cards may be played per turn.

##### Phase 2: Buying Units  
- Reveal Empire card; advance Strength marker on VP track by its Strength value (cumulative).
- Gather number of Army tokens equal to Strength value (use correct Epoch side).
- May convert Armies to Fleets or Forts during Expansion (1:1).
- Fleets:
  - Only if Empire card shows Fleet symbol (with listed seas/oceans).
  - “Ocean+” allows building in adjacent seas.
  - Must build at least one Fleet if unable, forfeit one build (remove one Army from supply).

##### Phase 3: Initial Placement  
- Place 1 Army in the Start Land shown on Empire card.
- If star symbol has capital name, place Capital token too.
- Any enemy units in Start Land must retreat:
  - To adjacent land region occupied by same player, same Epoch/unit type.
  - Armies cannot retreat over water (except straits with arrows).
  - If no valid retreat path, units are eliminated.
- Any Fort in Start Land is destroyed.
- Stacking limit: 3 armies + 1 fort per land region.

##### Phase 4: Expansion  
- Place remaining units one at a time into:
  - Regions already occupied by player, or
  - Adjacent to occupied regions (land or sea).
- Fleets:
  - Must be adjacent to player-controlled land or connected via water to such land ("port rule").
  - Max 2 fleets per sea; unlimited in oceans.
  - Fleets in Caspian Sea are invalid and removed.
- Forts:
  - Spend 1 Army to place 1 Fort in a controlled land region.
  - Max 1 Fort per region.
  - Fort adds +1 to defender's die roll.
  - Fort destroyed when last defending army is removed.

##### Combat (Triggered During Expansion)  
Occurs when placing a unit into a region with another player’s unit.

**Land Combat:**
- Attacker rolls 2 white dice.
- Defender rolls 1 black die.
- Highest single die wins; re-roll ties.
- Loser removes 1 unit.
- Battle continues until:
  - Defender eliminated, or
  - Attacker calls off attack.
- Attacker may commit additional units one at a time from supply.

**Defender Rolls 2 Dice (instead of 1) When:**
- Attacking into difficult terrain (mountains, forest/jungle, Great Wall) located in defender’s region
- Attacking across water (including straits)
- Attacking across a strait not controlled by attacker

**Special Rules:**
- Fort: +1 to defender’s die roll (does not count as a unit)
- Automatic Victory: Attacking player’s own former empire (same color)
- Amphibious Assault: Treated as difficult terrain (defender rolls 2 dice)
- Oceans: Combat is optional

**Naval Combat:**
- Same as land combat but:
  - No fort or terrain bonuses
  - Fleets only

**Outcome of Combat:**
- If attacker wins and occupies land:
  - Fort and City tokens destroyed
  - Capital flipped to City side
  - Monuments remain and change ownership

##### Phase 5: Build Monuments  
- Must build a monument if possible.
- Requirements:
  - Control at least 2 resource symbols (pickaxe/shovel) not used this turn
  - No cost
- Placement priority:
  1. Capital city
  2. City site
  3. Resource site
- Cannot build if no valid site or monument already present.
- Monuments never destroyed except by specific Event cards.

##### Phase 6: Scoring  
Player scores VP for:
- 2 VP per Capital controlled
- 1 VP per City controlled
- 1 VP per Monument controlled
- 1 VP per Sea (not ocean) controlled
- Area scoring (by colored region):
  - **Presence**: At least 1 army → base VP
  - **Domination**: At least 3 armies and more than any other player → 2× base VP
  - **Control**: All regions in area → 3× base VP
- VP values vary by Epoch (see board chart)
- Score includes all armies (current and remnants from past empires)

After all players complete turns, the Epoch ends.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Stacking Limits  
- Land: max 3 armies + 1 fort of one player
- Sea: max 2 fleets of one player
- Oceans: unlimited fleets, multiple players allowed
- Only one player’s units per land/sea region at end of turn

#### Unit Movement & Placement  
- No movement outside Initial Placement (except retreats)
- Expansion only into adjacent or connected regions
- Fleets require port access; lose connection → destroyed

#### Event Cards  
- Most are self-explanatory
- **Minor Empires**: Act like normal empires but all actions resolved in Phase 1; score during player’s Phase 6
- **Vacant Lands**: Units removed, but Capitals/Cities/Monuments remain; next occupier claims without combat
- **Barbarians**: Follow normal combat rules; reduce capitals to cities, destroy cities

#### Optional Rules  
- **Monuments**: Use player-colored side; worth 2 VP if controlled by builder, 1 VP otherwise
- **Fortresses**: Spend 2 Strength points to build (reverse of Fort marker); +1 die bonus and wins ties
  - Can upgrade existing Fort to Fortress using Event card that allows unit placement

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after Epoch VII scoring.
- Final VP = cumulative score from all Epochs.
- Pre-eminence markers (if used): Drawn by leader after each Epoch; add bonus VP at end (details not fully specified in source).
- Highest total VP wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I move units outside Initial Placement?**  
A: No. Only retreats (forced movement) occur during Initial Placement.

**Q: What happens to fleets when land connection is broken?**
