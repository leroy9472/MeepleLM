## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *La Citta*, players are Italian nobles competing to build the most desirable cities over six years. The goal is to attract and sustain the largest population by providing services in culture, education, and health, while managing food and gold. Victory is determined by citizen count, city completeness, and avoiding food shortages in the final year.

2. Components  
- Game board with hexagonal terrain tiles (fields, mountains, lakes)  
- Player sets: castles, colored citizens, action cards (3 per player), gold coins  
- Politics cards (e.g., Cathedral, Hospital, Rich Harvest, Golden Times, Bread & Games, Master Builder, etc.)  
- Voice of the People cards (showing culture, education, or health)  
- Building tiles: small (farm, quarry, market, fountain, statue, school), medium (palace, bath, hospital), large (cathedral, university)  
- Food tokens  
- Start player marker  

3. Setup  
- Board Extent:  
  - 2 players: use only light green (white) hexes  
  - 3 players: include brown hexes  
  - 4–5 players: use entire board  
- Place terrain tiles:  
  - Use defined layouts from rules OR place randomly (experienced variant)  
- Initial Cities:  
  - Each player places 2 cities:  
    1. Starting player places first, then counterclockwise for first city each  
    2. Last to place first city places second city, then clockwise for second cities  
  - Cities must be at least 3 hexes apart  
- Place 3 gray citizens on each starting castle  
- Food: Each player takes food tokens equal to food symbols adjacent to their cities (castles count as farms)  
- Politics Cards: Shuffle and place 7 face-up; rest form draw pile  
- Voice of the People deck: placed separately  
- Start Player: Player to the left of the last to place a second city takes the marker  

4. Gameplay Flow (6 Rounds = 6 Years)  
Each year consists of 8 phases:  
1. **Change Start Player**: Pass marker left (skip in Year 1)  
2. **New Voice of the People**: Reveal 1 card face-up, place 3 face-down  
3. **Quarry Earnings**: Each quarry earns $1 per adjacent mountain (can earn $2 if between two)  
4. **Population Growth**: Add 1 citizen to each city if population limits allow  
5. **Political Rounds (5 rounds)**:  
   - Players take turns (clockwise) playing 1 card per round  
   - Options:  
     - Play 1 of own 3 Action Cards (usable once per year)  
     - Play 1 of 7 face-up Politics Cards (immediate effect; replace with new card)  
   - If unable/unwilling to act: draw top Politics Card face-down (counts as pass)  
6. **Reveal Voice of the People**: Turn 3 face-down cards face-up  
   - Determine majority service (one service with most cards) or tie between two  
7. **Defection (Migration)**:  
   - In turn order, for each of your cities, compare to opponent cities within 1–2 hexes along paths  
   - If your city has more service points in the majority service (or either tied service, your choice), move 1 citizen from opponent city to yours  
   - Only 1 citizen moves between any two cities  
   - If city overfills, excess goes to common supply  
   - After migration: all buildings must be manned  
     - Move citizens within city to save buildings; demolish unmanned ones  
     - City must remain contiguous; demolish from extremities  
     - If farm demolished, return food tokens  
8. **Feed Citizens**:  
   - Must have ≥ food tokens as citizens  
   - If short: remove 1 citizen per missing food token  
     - Remove from castles or extremities  
     - Demolish buildings if needed  
   - Penalty: next year, forfeit first political action by turning an Action Card face-down  
   - Note: Rich Harvest card cannot be used in Year 6  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Action Cards (3 per player, reusable yearly)**:  
  ① Take $2  
  ② Build small building (requires spare citizen)  
  ③ Found new city (once/year): move 1 citizen from existing city, add 2 new; gain food from adjacent fields  
- **Politics Cards (examples)**:  
  - Golden Times: Pay $0/$2/$5 to add 1/2/3 citizens  
  - Bread & Games: Pay $0/$2/$5 to add 1/2/3 attraction points (temporary service boost)  
  - Rich Harvest: Double a farm’s food output (cannot use in Year 6)  
  - Master Builder: Build any building (cost: $1 small, $2 medium, $4 large)  
  - Closeness to the People: Pay $2 to view all 3 hidden Voice cards  
- **Building Rules**:  
  - Must be placed so arches face same direction  
  - Cannot connect two cities with a building  
  - Fountain/Public Bath: must be adjacent to lake  
  - Farm: adjacent to fields  
  - Quarry: adjacent to mountains  
  - Market: allows city to exceed 5 citizens; provides 1 free citizen  
  - Fountain/Bath: required (with Market) to exceed 8 citizens  
- **Population Limits**:  
  - 1–5: all cities  
  - 6–8: requires Market  
  - 9+: requires Market + Fountain or Public Bath  
- **New Cities**:  
  - Max 1 per year  
  - ≥3 hexes from any other city  
  - Requires 1 citizen from existing city + 2 new citizens  
  - Must remain connected (via paths) to other cities  
- **Demolition**:  
  - Unmanned buildings are demolished  
  - Cities must remain connected; castle is last to be removed  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after Year 6  
- Scoring:  
  - +1 VP per citizen  
  - +3 VP per city that has at least 1 of each service (Culture, Education, Health)  
  - –5 VP if unable to feed citizens in Year 6  
- Tiebreaker: not specified in sources  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Feeding before Migration (Variant)**: Some sources suggest feeding before migration, but standard is after  
- **Rich Harvest in Year 6**: Explicitly prohibited  
- **Service Ties in Voice of the People**: Player chooses which service to use for their cities  
- **Multiple Migrations**: Only 1 citizen moves between any two cities per turn  
- **Building Placement**: Cannot link two cities; must maintain city separation  
- **Action Card Reuse**: All 3 Action Cards reset face-up each year  
- **Politics Card Refill**: After playing one, replace immediately to maintain 7 face-up  
- **Passing**: Only by taking top Politics Card face-down if no legal action
