## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Ticket to Ride: London is a streamlined version of the Ticket to Ride series, set in London. Players build transport routes using buses to connect locations across the city.  

**Primary Objectives:**  
- Claim routes between adjacent locations.  
- Complete destination tickets by connecting their two endpoints with a continuous path of claimed routes.  
- Fully connect all locations within each colored district to earn district bonus points.  

The player with the most points at game end wins.

### 2. Components  
- Game board depicting London with routes between locations.  
- Bus tokens (player pieces, one set per player).  
- Score marker for each player.  
- Transportation cards (colored and wild "bus" cards).  
- Destination ticket cards (showing two locations and point values).  

*(Note: Physical components like plastic buses and cards are assumed standard.)*

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Each player takes:  
   - A set of bus tokens.  
   - A score marker placed at 0 on the score track.  
3. Shuffle transportation cards and deal 2 face down to each player.  
   - Bus cards are wild and can substitute for any color.  
   - No hand limit.  
4. Reveal 5 transportation cards face up beside the board.  
   - If 3 or more are bus (wild) cards, discard all 5 and replace with 5 new ones.  
5. Shuffle destination tickets and deal 2 to each player face down.  
   - Each player must keep at least 1; discarded tickets go to the bottom of the deck.  
6. Place both decks near the board.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds clockwise. On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:  

#### a. Draw 1 or 2 Transportation Cards  
- Draw from the face-up display or the draw deck.  
- If drawing a face-up **bus (wild)** card, it is the **only** card you may take that turn.  
- After drawing, immediately replace any drawn face-up card with a new one from the deck.  
  - If the replacement is a bus card and you haven’t taken your second card yet, you may take it.  
- If the deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.  

#### b. Claim One Route  
- Choose any unclaimed route on the map.  
- Discard one transportation card per bus token required to claim the route.  
  - Route colors must match the card color, **or** use bus (wild) cards.  
  - For **gray routes**, choose one color and use only that color (including wilds as that color).  
- Place your bus tokens on the route.  
- Move your score marker according to the **Route Scoring Table** (points based on route length).  
- **Double routes**: Two routes between the same locations.  
  - **In all games**: A single player cannot claim both.  
  - **In 2-player games**: Once one is claimed, the other is **forbidden** (cannot be claimed by anyone).  

#### c. Draw Destination Tickets  
- Draw **2** destination ticket cards from the top of the deck.  
- You **must keep at least 1**; return the other(s) to the bottom of the deck.  
- If only 1 card remains, you must keep it.  
- Tickets remain secret until scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Route Claiming**: No requirement to connect to existing routes. Any route may be claimed if cards and buses are available.  
- **Transportation Cards**: Unlimited hand size. Bus cards are wild.  
- **Double Routes**:  
  - Same player may never claim both.  
  - In 2-player games, one claimed = other is blocked.  
- **District Scoring**:  
  - Each location belongs to a numbered, color-coded district.  
  - To score a district, **all locations** in that district must be connected (directly or indirectly) via your routes.  
  - Score the number shown in the circle (e.g., District 1 = 1 point per location? Clarified below).  
  - **No penalty** for failing to complete a district.  
- **Ticket Completion**:  
  - Gain points listed on ticket if connected.  
  - Lose same number of points if not connected by game end.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Game End Trigger  
- When any player has **2 or fewer** bus tokens left, the game enters its final round.  
- All players (including the one who triggered the end) take **one more turn**.  

#### Final Scoring  
1. **Route Points**: Confirm points from all claimed routes.  
2. **Destination Tickets**:  
   - Reveal all tickets.  
   - Add points for completed tickets.  
   - Subtract points for uncompleted tickets.  
3. **District Bonuses**:  
   - For each district where **all locations** are connected by your routes, score the **number shown in the circle** (e.g., District 1 = 1 point? Source ambiguity).  
   - Based on solo rules example: District 1 has 2 locations; completing it scores **1 point**. Likely, the number = points for full connection.  
4. **Total Score**: Sum route points, ticket points (positive and negative), and district bonuses.  

#### Tiebreaker  
- Player with the **most completed destination tickets** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I claim a route not connected to my network?**  
  Yes. No adjacency requirement.  
- **Can I claim both routes in a double route pair?**  
  No. Same player may never claim both.  
- **In 2-player game, if one route is claimed, can opponent claim the other?**  
  No. The second route is **forbidden** and cannot be claimed by anyone.  
- **Do I announce ticket completion during the game?**  
  No. Keep completions secret until final scoring.  
- **What if I run out of destination tickets?**  
  If only 1 card remains when drawing tickets, you must keep it. If deck is empty, you cannot draw tickets.  
- **Can I draw transportation cards even if I can’t claim routes?**  
  Yes. Drawing cards is always a valid action.
