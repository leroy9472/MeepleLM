### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Card precedence**: Card text overrides rulebook
- **Hand visibility**: Opponents may know how many cards you hold, but not which ones
- **Energy tokens**: Gained when drafting/investing cards with tokens
- **Heroic Tactics**: Separate deck/hand; unaffected by effects targeting regular deck/hand unless specified
- **Multiple abilities**: Can only use "once per situation" abilities once per qualifying situation
- **Costs**: Must be fully paid to use card/ability
