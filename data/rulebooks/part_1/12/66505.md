## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are the head of a trading house in Hamburg’s Speicherstadt (warehouse district). Using strategic bidding and resource management, you acquire trade cards that represent ships, infrastructure, and services. Your goal is to earn the most victory points through contracts, goods, buildings, and special abilities. The game ends when the final "4th Fire" card is drawn. The player with the highest score wins; in case of a tie, the player with more coins wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board (showing Speicherstadt with water spaces, building spaces, and score track)  
- 54 trade cards in 5 types:  
  - Winter (A): 12 cards  
  - Spring (B): 13 cards  
  - Summer (C): 13 cards  
  - Autumn (D): 15 cards  
  - 4th Fire (E): 1 card (end-game marker)  
- 20 workers (4 per player in 5 colors)  
- 25 coins  
- 1 metal coin (first player marker)  
- 45 goods cubes:  
  - 9 coffee (brown)  
  - 9 tea (green)  
  - 9 saffron (yellow)

1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Put all 45 goods cubes into the bag; place it next to the board.  
3. Place all coins in a stockpile next to the board.  
4. Each player:  
   - Chooses a color  
   - Places 1 worker on the 0 space of the score track  
   - Places remaining 3 workers in front of them  
   - Receives 5 coins  
   - Takes 1 market hall card  
5. Remove specific Autumn (D) trade cards based on player count:  
   - 2 players: Port, Fireman (value 3), Mayor, Truck  
   - 3 players: Boatsmen Church, Fireman (value 3), Mayor, Truck  
   - 4 players: None  
   - 5 players: Boatsmen Church, Fireman (value 3), Mayor, Truck  
6. Sort trade cards by season (A, B, C, D, E).  
7. Shuffle each season’s deck, then stack in order:  
   - Bottom: 4th Fire (E)  
   - Then: Autumn (D)  
   - Then: Summer (C)  
   - Then: Spring (B)  
   - Top: Winter (A)  
   All face-down. Place as draw pile next to board; leave space for discard pile.  
8. The player who most recently visited Hamburg becomes first player and takes the metal coin.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has 5 phases:  
1. **Supply**  
2. **Demand**  
3. **Purchase**  
4. **Loading**  
5. **Income**  

Repeat until the 4th Fire card is revealed and resolved.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### 1) Supply  
- Draw and reveal trade cards face-up onto the water spaces:  
  - 2 players: 3 cards  
  - 3 players: 4 cards  
  - 4 players: 5 cards  
  - 5 players: 6 cards  
- If any **Ship** cards are revealed:  
  - For each ship, draw 3 random goods cubes from the bag and place them on the ship.  
- If a **Fire** card is revealed:  
  - Immediately halt regular phase flow.  
  - All players sum the values of their **Fireman** cards.  
  - Player with highest sum gains points shown on Fire card.  
  - Player with lowest sum loses same number of points.  
  - In case of tie: all tied players gain/lose points.  
  - If all sums are equal: no one gains or loses.  
  - Resolve Fire card, discard it, then draw a replacement card to refill water spaces.  
  - Continue with Demand phase.

#### 2) Demand  
- Starting with first player, then clockwise, each player places 1 worker on a trade card.  
- Place worker on the lowest unoccupied building space of chosen card.  
- Repeat until all players have placed all 3 workers.  
- Rules:  
  - You must place a worker each time (cannot pass).  
  - You may place multiple workers on the same card.  
  - If a card has 8 workers already, no more can be added.  
  - It’s allowed for a card to have no workers (no demand).  

#### 3) Purchase  
- Process cards from left to right (as placed in Supply).  
- For each card:  
  - Starting with the player whose worker is lowest on the card (i.e., first placed), that player decides whether to buy.  
  - **Buying**: Pay coins equal to number of workers on the card. Take the card and place it in front of you. All workers return to owners.  
  - **Not Buying**: Remove your worker. Price drops by 1. Next player (by worker position) may now buy at reduced price.  
  - Continue until someone buys the card or all decline.  
- If no one buys: discard the card.  
- Note: You cannot pay with the metal coin.

#### 4) Loading  
- Only occurs from Spring (B) onward, and only if at least one Ship has been purchased.  
- Players take turns clockwise starting with first player. Optionally, all may act simultaneously to speed play.  
- Actions (only with cards you own):  

##### Ship  
- When you buy a ship, immediately unload it: remove all goods.  
- For each good, choose one action:  
  - Place on a matching **Contract**  
  - Sell to a **Merchant**  
  - Store in **Warehouse**  
  - Use in **Market Hall** (convert, sell, keep)  
- At end of Loading phase, no goods may remain on ships. Unused goods go to stock (not bag).

##### Contract  
- Place goods from ships, warehouse, or market hall onto contracts.  
- Goods must match contract type (e.g., brown cube on coffee).  
- Contracts:  
  - Small: 2 goods → 5 pts  
  - Medium: 3 goods → 8 pts  
  - Large: 4 goods → 11 pts  
- Goods can be added in steps. Once placed, cannot be removed.  
- Only completed contracts score at game end.

##### Merchant Cards (Coffee Roaster, Tea Taster, Spice Trader, Carpet Trader, Vulcanizer)  
- Sell any number of matching goods.  
- Receive 1 coin per good sold.  
- Put goods into stock (not bag).  
- Each merchant pays for one type:  
  - Coffee Roaster: brown (coffee)  
  - Tea Taster: green (tea)  
  - Spice Trader: yellow (saffron)  
  - Carpet Trader: red (carpet)  
  - Vulcanizer: white (rubber)

##### Warehouse  
- Store or retrieve goods.  
- Max 4 goods in warehouse at any time.  
- At game end: 1 point per good in warehouse.

##### Market Hall  
- Each player has one. Use during Loading:  
  - **Convert**: Return 3 goods to stock, take 1 different good from stock.  
  - **Sell**: Return 2 goods to stock, take 1 coin.  
  - **Keep**: Store up to 1 good in market hall for next round.

#### 5) Income  
- Each player receives 1 coin from stock.  
- Players who bought **no trade card** this round receive **1 additional coin** (total 2).  
- First player passes the metal coin to the left.  
- If stock lacks coins, use external tokens (e.g., dice, real coins).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when **4th Fire (E)** is the last card in the draw pile.  
- Reveal and resolve it as a normal Fire card (points based on Fireman values).  
- After resolution, game ends.  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - **Contracts**: Score only completed ones (5/8/11 pts). Incomplete = 0.  
  - **Counting Office**:  
    - 1: 2 pts  
    - 2: 5 pts  
    - 3: 9 pts  
    - 4: 14 pts  
  - **Chamber of Commerce**: 1 pt per coin owned.  
  - **Port**: 1 pt per Ship owned.  
  - **Boatsmen Church**: 3 pts  
  - **St. Michaelis**: 4 pts  
  - **Warehouse**: 1 pt per good stored  
  - **Merchants (Coffee Roaster, etc.)**: 1 pt each  
  - **Bank**: Does not score points; gives income only  
  - **Fireman**: Do not score directly, but used in Fire events  
- Total all points. Highest score wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with more coins wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **All 8 building spaces occupied**: No more workers can be placed on that card.  
- **No workers on a card**: Discard the card during Purchase phase.  
- **No coins in stock during Income**: Use substitute tokens.  
- **Multiple Fires**: Each Fire card resolves immediately when drawn.  
- **Goods Stock vs. Bag**: Goods sold, expired, or converted go to **stock**, not back to bag. Only initial draw uses the bag.  
- **Market Hall Keep Limit**: Only 1 good may be kept in market hall between rounds.  
- **Simultaneous Play**: Loading phase may be done simultaneously for speed, but no trading between players is allowed.
