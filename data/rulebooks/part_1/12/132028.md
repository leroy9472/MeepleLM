## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear (CoH) is a tactical World War II board game simulating small-unit combat on the Eastern Front. Players take command of German or Soviet forces in historically inspired firefights. The objective varies by scenario but generally involves eliminating enemy units, capturing key terrain, or achieving mission-specific goals.

Victory is determined by Victory Points (VPs), scored through:
- Eliminating enemy units
- Destroying or preserving specific high-value units (e.g., KV tanks)
- Controlling strategic hexes via control markers at game end

### 2. Components  
- Hexagonal game map(s)  
- Unit counters (infantry, vehicles, guns) with stats for movement, fire power, defense, etc.  
- Hit, smoke, spent, and control markers  
- Order cards (used for 'spent' checks and AI activation)  
- Command Action Points (CAPs) tracker  
- Action cards (green, red, bonus)  
- Dice (2D6)

*Note: Hidden units and smoke are tracked via specific counters. Some scenarios include mission-specific components like mine counters or control markers.*

### 3. Setup  
1. **Map**: Set up the designated map(s) per scenario (e.g., Map 2 and 12 for "Panzerkoloss Ahead").  
2. **Units**: Place units according to scenario setup instructions, including entry edges and reinforcement rounds.  
3. **Markers**:  
   - Place smoke, control, or mine counters as directed.  
   - Use neutral markers on specified hexes if required.  
4. **Decks**:  
   - Shuffle order cards (Solo: use specified deck, e.g., 05–43).  
   - Draw initial action cards per scenario (e.g., 2 in Round 1, then 1 per round).  
5. **CAPs**: Set starting CAPs per side (e.g., German: 12, Soviet: 10).  
6. **Initiative**: Roll 2D6; highest goes first. Tie? Re-roll. Up to 2 CAPs may be spent to modify roll.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

#### Round Progression  
Each round follows this sequence:  
1. **Flip spent counters** – Reactivate spent units.  
2. **Reduce/remove smoke counters** – Decrease +2DM smoke to +1DM; remove +1DM.  
3. **Reset CAPs** – Restore full CAPs for the round.  
4. **Draw cards** – Draw action cards per scenario rules.  
5. **Resolve off-board artillery** – Apply indirect fire if applicable.  
6. **Apply reinforcements** – Enter units per scenario schedule.  
7. **Initiative** – Roll for turn order (2D6, CAPs may modify).

#### Turn Progression  
Players alternate turns. On your turn, choose one:  
- **Action with unspent unit**: Move, fire, rally, or command.  
- **Command action**: Use CAPs to perform an action on any unit (does not change spent status).  
- **Card action**: Play an action card.  
- **Stall**: Gain 1 AP. Perform a 'spent' check on the active unit.  
- **Pass**: End your turn.  

Play continues until both players pass consecutively → next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Spent Check  
After performing an action (except command or card), if the AP cost ≥ number on drawn order card → flip unit to spent.  
- **Ignore spent check**: If card has symbol, player may ignore (AI cannot).  

#### Movement  
- Base AP cost: Top-right of counter (red = foot, blue = vehicle).  
- Terrain costs: Add AP per terrain chart (e.g., woods, rough).  
- Backward move: +1 AP.  
- Pivot: Free at end of move; otherwise 1 AP or 1 CAP.  
- **Bonus Move**: Vehicles with icon(s) may move extra hex(es) per action.  

**Hidden Movement**:  
- +3 AP into cover, +6 AP into open.  
- All other modifiers ignored.  
- Units hide by spending 7 AP if out of enemy LOS (foot, un-hit, unburdened).  

#### Rally Action  
Attempt to remove hit marker from a non-eliminated unit not adjacent to enemy:  
- Active unit: 5 AP + 'spent' check.  
- Any unit: 5 CAPs (no spent check).  
- Action card: Rally at no cost if specified.  

**Rally Attempt**:  
- Roll 2D6 ≥ number on hit counter → remove hit.  
- +1 if in cover.  
- +1 if stacked with friendly un-hit unit.  

#### Combat Action  
A unit may fire if:  
- **Line of Sight (LOS)**: Clear from center to center; no blocking terrain in path.  
- **Arc of Fire**: Target is in one of the 3 front hexes.  
- **Range**: Distance ≤ 2 × unit’s range stat.  

**Resolve Combat**:  
1. **Attack Value (AV)** = FP + 2D6 + CAPs (max 2)  
   - FP used: Red (soft) vs soft DR, Blue (armored) vs armored DR  
   - FP modifiers:  
     - Adjacent: +3 FP  
     - Distance > range: -2 FP  
     - Same hex: -2 FP (white box FP) or +4 FP  
2. **Defense Value (DV)** = DR + Terrain Modifier (+1 for cover)  
   - Use front DR if in frontal arc, else flank DR  
3. **Result**:  
   - AV ≥ DV + 4 → Eliminate target  
   - AV ≥ DV → Target takes hit  
   - Else: No effect  

**Taking a Hit**:  
- If already has hit → Eliminated (return to pool).  
- Else → Draw hit token, opponent places under counter.  
- **Range combat**: Hits all enemy units in hex (roll individually).  
- **Close combat**: Hits one enemy unit.  
- **Eliminated unit**: -1 total CAPs for rest of game.  

#### Line of Sight (LOS)  
- **Blocking Terrain**: Woods, buildings, hills, smoke.  
- **Elevation**:  
  - Woods/buildings on L0 = L1 blocking; on L1 = L2 blocking.  
- **Plateau Effect**:  
  - Unit on L1: Can see first higher hex (L1/L2), but nothing beyond at same/lower level.  
  - Unit on L2: Cannot see lower elevations if obstructed by same-or-higher blocking terrain.  
- **Blind Spots**:  
  - One-hex blind spot behind L1 obstruction when viewed from L2.  
  - Infinite blind spot behind same-level or higher terrain.  
- **Steps for LOS**:  
  1. Draw line from unit to target.  
  2. Adjust for terrain + woods/buildings.  
  3. Apply plateau/blind spot rules based on elevation.  

#### Smoke  
- **+1DM Smoke**:  
  - Does not block LOS.  
  - Defender gains +1DM.  
  - Acts as L1 blocking terrain for DM assignment.  
- **+2DM Smoke**:  
  - Acts as L2 blocking terrain.  
  - Blocks LOS (cannot pass through).  
  - Creates plateau effect: Obscures all lower elevations.  
- Smoke is cumulative: Two +1DM = +2DM.  

#### Hidden Units  
- No facing until revealed.  
- Revealed when:  
  - Takes any action except hidden move or stall.  
  - Shares hex with non-hidden unit.  
  - Enemy unit enters within 2 hexes (open) or same hex (cover).  
- **Attacks on hidden hexes**:  
  - Resolve against lowest front DR (direct fire) or flank DR (artillery/mortar).  
  - If one hidden unit hit → all in hex revealed.  
- **Hiding**: Un-hit, unburdened foot unit out of LOS may spend 7 AP to hide within 1 hex.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when round marker reaches specified round (e.g., Round 5 = Mission Track 20).  
- Final VPs scored per scenario:  
  - **Panzerkoloss Ahead**:  
    - German: 1 VP per Russian unit eliminated, 2 VP per KV destroyed, 3 VP per control marker.  
    - Soviet: 1 VP per German unit eliminated, 2 VP per surviving KV, 3 VP per control marker.  
- Highest total VPs wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a unit move and pivot for free?** Yes, pivot at end of move is free.  
- **Can CAPs be used to modify rally rolls?** No, only AV rolls.  
- **Do smoke counters block movement?** No, only LOS and fire.  
- **Can a spent unit be commanded?** Yes, using CAPs (command action).  
- **Can hidden units be targeted?** Yes, but resolve against lowest DR in hex.  
- **Do eliminated units affect CAPs immediately?** Yes, -1 CAP per eliminated unit for rest of game.  
- **Can you stall with a spent unit?** Yes, but must still make a spent check.  
- **Can you use bonus move after pivoting?** Yes, if action allows.
