## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players are farmers in the Upper Midwest of 19th-century America, growing crops, fulfilling contracts, and shipping goods via riverboats to gain influence in New Orleans. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) over four rounds by strategically managing workers, crops, estate features, and riverboat contracts. The player with the highest VP after Final Scoring wins.

4. Shuffle the 56 Cultivation Cards and place face down near the boards.  
5. Shuffle the 17 Opportunity Cards, deal four face up on the New Orleans Board, and place the rest face down nearby.  
6. Place Barns (8), Wells (8), Surveyors (28), and Coins (25) in general supply.  
7. Separate Crop Tiles into 1-, 2-, and 3-Hex piles. Stock the Scoring and Crop Tile Board with face-up tiles in designated areas; place remaining tiles face down nearby.  
8. Place the 5 Phase Tiles face up within reach.  
9. Each player takes:  
   a. 1 random Player Board  
   b. 1 Harbour Master, placed on the Harbour Track starting space based on player count  
   c. 13 Workers  
   d. 2 Surveyors  
   e. 3 Coins  
   f. 2 Score Markers (–/50 and 100/150). Place –/50 marker on 0 of Scoring Track; keep 100/150 in reserve.  
   g. First Player is randomly chosen and receives the First Player Marker.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 4 Rounds. Each Round consists of:  
- Start-of-Round Restock (skip in Round 1)  
- Phase Tile Draft  
- 5 Phases in fixed order:  
  1. Cultivation  
  2. Planting  
  3. Harvesting and Shipping  
  4. Opportunity  
  5. Scoring  

After Round 4, conduct Final Scoring.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Start of Round (Rounds 2–4):**  
- Refill empty spaces on Scoring and Crop Tile Board with face-up Crop Tiles.  
- Refill empty Riverboat spaces on New Orleans Board with top tile from respective stack.  
- Refill all four Opportunity Card spaces with face-up cards.  

**Phase Tile Draft:**  
- Starting with First Player and proceeding clockwise, players take turns selecting one Phase Tile until all 5 are claimed. Some players may receive multiple tiles.  

**Phase 1: Cultivation**  
- The player with the Cultivation Phase Tile takes one Worker from the Round Track and places it on any empty field on their board.  
- They then draw 8 Cultivation Cards face down and reveal them one at a time, calling out the field color (or “wild” for multicolor).  
- All players with Workers in supply must place one Worker on an empty field matching the revealed color.  
  - If no matching field is available, place on any empty field.  
  - Wild cards allow placement on any field.  
- Spending 1 Coin: Ignore the revealed color and place on any empty field.  
- Players without Workers in supply do not participate.  
- Continue until all 8 cards are processed.  

**Phase 2: Planting**  
- The player with the Planting Phase Tile gains 1 Coin.  
- Starting with that player and proceeding clockwise, each player selects one Crop Tile from the Scoring and Crop Tile Board and places it under 1, 2, or 3 adjacent Workers (not already under a crop).  
  - Tile must match the number and shape of covered fields.  
  - Field color and crop type do not matter.  
  - Tile cannot be moved once placed.  
- Placing a 2-Hex Tile: Gain 1 VP immediately.  
- Placing a 3-Hex Tile: Gain 2 VP immediately.  
- Spending 1 Coin: Instead of taking a face-up tile, select a 1- or 2-Hex Tile (not 3-Hex) from the respective draw pile. Must take one tile. Shuffle pile afterward.  
- Exception: If no face-up tile can legally be placed by a player whose Workers remain uncovered, refill the entire Crop Board immediately.  
- Continue until all Workers from Phase 1 are under Crop Tiles.  

**Phase 3: Harvesting and Shipping**  
- The player with the Harvesting and Shipping Phase Tile advances their Harbour Master 1 space.  
- Starting with that player and proceeding clockwise, each player may claim Riverboat Tiles in up to two actions (three in Round 4). On a turn, a player may:  
  - Claim one Riverboat Tile from the New Orleans Board, or  
  - Pass (and take no further actions this phase).  
- To claim a Riverboat: Remove a number of Workers equal to the boat’s capacity from a single crop type on your board. Return removed Workers to personal supply.  
- Take the Riverboat and place it in the leftmost empty indentation on your Player Board.  
- Immediately gain the benefit shown on the Riverboat (e.g., Coin, Surveyor, Agent).  
- Spending 1 Coin: Take a Riverboat Tile of matching capacity from the draw pile instead of the display. Cannot do so if the pile is empty.  
- Harvesting Bonus: As soon as a player has 9 or more crops of one type (anywhere on board), they immediately gain one Estate Feature of choice (Barn, Well, or Surveyor). This can trigger once per crop type.  

**Estate Features:**  
- Barn: Place on an empty field space (no crop, no worker). Scores 2 VP per adjacent crop of one type (max 12 VP).  
- Well: Place on a Crop Hex (with or without Worker) of a crop type not already containing a Well. Scores 1 VP per tile in the contiguous group of that crop type, including itself.  
- Surveyor: Keep in supply. Used in Scoring Phase.  
- If a feature is unavailable in supply, player may take any other.  

**Agents:**  
- Some Riverboat benefits or Scoring Phase actions allow sending a Worker from personal supply to New Orleans (place in your colored section). These become Agents.  
- Agents are permanent; they no longer count toward worker supply.  
- Score 1 VP per Agent each Scoring Phase.  

**Phase 4: Opportunity**  
- The player with the Opportunity Phase Tile gains 1 VP.  
- Starting with that player and proceeding clockwise, each player selects one face-up Opportunity Card from the New Orleans Board and places it next to their board.  
- They immediately gain the bonus above the card’s space:  
  - 2 Harbour Master Moves  
  - 1 Surveyor  
  - 1 Agent (send 1 Worker to New Orleans)  
  - 1 Coin  
- Spending 1 Coin: Instead of taking a face-up card, take any card from the draw pile (must take one). No bonus is received. Shuffle pile afterward.  
- Any remaining cards are placed on the bottom of the draw pile.  

**Phase 5: Scoring**  
- The player with the Scoring Phase Tile chooses one:  
  - Take 1 Coin  
  - Advance Harbour Master 1 space  
  - Send 1 Worker to New Orleans (become Agent)  
- Starting with that player and proceeding clockwise, each player may use up to 2 Surveyors (3 in Round 4) to score:  
  - **Barn:** Place Surveyor on Barn. Score 2 VP per adjacent crop of one type (max 12 VP). Final score is locked.  
  - **Well:** Place Surveyor on Well. Score 1 VP per tile in the contiguous group of matching crop type. Final score is locked.  
  - **Opportunity Card:** Place Surveyor on card. Score VP as specified. Final score is locked.  
- Each item may be scored only once. Surveyors remain in place.  
- After all players have acted:  
  - Score 1 VP for each Surveyor currently on the board (active).  
  - Score 1 VP for each Agent in New Orleans.  
- Advance Score Markers accordingly. Flip marker from – to 50 after first pass of 0; replace with 100/150 marker at second pass (set to 100), flip to 150 at third pass.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
After Round 4, conduct Final Scoring:  
- **Coins:** 1 VP per Coin in personal supply.  
- **Field Coverage:** 7 VP per field color (white, grey, orange, mustard, brown) that is completely covered by Crop Tiles and/or Barns.  
- **Unscored Estate Features:** 2 VP per Barn, Well, or Surveyor not yet scored.  
- **Harbour Scoring:**  
  - Determine player whose Harbour Master is farthest along the track.  
  - In case of tie, player with earliest Phase Tile (from Round 4) wins.  
  - That player scores full VP (equal to capacity) for each Riverboat Tile their Harbour Master has arrived at or passed.  
  - All other players score half the value (rounded up) of their Riverboats up to their Harbour Master’s position.  
  - Riverboats beyond the Harbour Master score nothing.  
- **Agent Bonus:**  
  - Rank players by number of Agents in New Orleans.  
  - 1st: 20 VP  
  - 2nd: 10 VP  
  - 3rd: 5 VP  
  - 4th: 0 VP  
  - Tiebreaker: Player with earlier Phase Tile (Round 4) ranks higher.  
  - A player must have at least 1 Agent to score.  
- Highest total VP wins. Ties result in shared victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **No Workers Left?** A player with no Workers in supply skips Cultivation Phase.  
- **No Matching Crop Tile?** If no face-up tile can cover remaining Workers, refill the entire Crop Board.  
- **No 1-Hex Tiles Left?** If no 1-Hex tiles remain and all Workers are on single hexes, remove Workers and skip Planting.  
- **Harbour Master Position:** Only Riverboats at or before the Harbour Master’s position score.  
- **Phase Tile Tiebreakers:** Used in Final Scoring for Harbour and Agent rankings. Based on player’s Phase Tile from Round 4 (earlier = better).  
- **3-Player Game Rule:** After Round 3, pass First Player Marker to player farthest behind on score track (top marker breaks ties).  
- **Multiple Phase Tiles:** A player may gain multiple bonuses in one round if they draft multiple Phase Tiles.  
- **Estate Feature Exhaustion:** If Barns, Wells, or Surveyors are unavailable, player may take any other.  
- **Scoring Lock:** Once a Barn, Well, or Opportunity Card is scored, it cannot be re-scored even if improved.
