### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Playing Cards  
- If a card offers multiple actions, the player chooses **one**.  
- A character or group can **move and/or attack only once per action**.

#### Movement  
- Characters/groups **move first, then attack**.  
- Movement is only allowed through or into **empty spaces**.  
- **Staircases** cost 1 movement point to ascend/descend.  
- Characters on staircases can attack those directly above or below.

#### Attacking and Defending  
- After moving, a character may attack any target within range and line of sight (LOS).  
- **Roll attack dice** as indicated on the Reference Chart.  
- Defender may roll **defense dice** if allowed. Each **block** result reduces hits by 1.  
- Characters **without damage tracks** are removed after 1 hit.  
- Characters **with damage tracks** record hits; they are removed when the counter reaches the red space.

#### Line of Sight (LOS)  
- Determine LOS by drawing a line between centers of two hexes.  
- LOS is **blocked** if a figure or obstruction lies in the path.  
- If the line runs along a hex edge, LOS is blocked **only if both adjacent hexes** contain obstructions.  
- **Doors** block LOS but not movement. Attack only possible from adjacent hexes on either side.

#### Special Spaces  
- **Doors** (Throne Room, Generator Core): Block LOS, allow adjacent-only attacks.  
- **Staircases**: Cost 1 movement point per floor; allow vertical attacks.  
- **Staging Zones** (light first-floor spaces):  
  - TF may place troops here when moving from battlefield to palace.  
  - Cannot move or attack the turn they are placed.  
  - If blocked by Naboo figures, units that cannot be placed are lost.  
- **Viceroy**: Immobilized, cannot be attacked or moved through, blocks LOS.

#### Theed Palace Battle  
- All Naboo characters (except Jedi/Sith) have **movement of 4**.  
- If the **real Queen is killed**, all Palace Guards’ movement is reduced to **2**.

#### Window Ledge Movement  
- When a "Window Ledge Movement" card is played:  
  - Naboo may move characters from a window-front hex to an empty hex above or below (or continue movement).  
  - Moving between floors counts as **1 space**.  
  - If destination is blocked, move is invalid.  
  - The card may instead be used for normal movement/attack.

#### Generator Core Battle (Jedi vs. Sith)  
- Jedi and Sith may **split movement and combat** during their turn.  
- After declaring an attack, attacker declares how many combat dice to roll (up to allowed maximum).  
- Defender rolls **full defense dice** for each attack.  
- Jedi/Sith may **only attack adjacent** characters.  
- If playing **"Special Attack Twice"** card, **maximum of 3 dice** per single attack.  
- Jedi/Sith **always roll defense dice**, even if attack misses.  
  - If green defense die shows a **hit**, the defender scores a **counter-hit** (regardless of range).  
  - Attacker does **not** roll defense dice for this hit.

#### Planes of Naboo (Battlefield)  
- Groups cannot be combined or split.  
- Half-hex spaces: cannot be occupied, moved through, or fired through.

#### Range  
- A unit with range 2 can attack a target 2 hexes away, but the **first hex must be empty** (unless specified otherwise).  
- **Catapults** may fire through occupied hexes.

#### The Shield  
- Groups can only attack enemies on the **same side** of the shield.  
- Hexes **intersected by the shield line**:  
  - May be attacked from or attack either side.  
  - **AATs and MTTs cannot enter** these hexes while shield is active.  
- If **either Fambaas is killed**, the shield **goes down** — all units may move and fire freely across the shield area.

#### Droids  
- Droids moved from battlefield to palace **must come from the same group**.  
- Newly deployed droids (via action card):  
  - Taken from **previously destroyed stocks** (if available).  
  - Placed in any **empty hex adjacent to an MTT**.  
  - If **all MTTs are destroyed**, no new droids may be deployed.

#### Bonus Cards  
- Awarded when a player **clears a hex of enemy units**.  
- Player chooses **1 bonus card** face down from either their **Battlefield or Palace deck**.  
- Bonus cards are **not revealed** until played in the next round, after the 4 main action cards.

#### Droid Control Ship Battle (Anakin’s Starfighter)  
- Anakin’s fighter must pass through **one empty slot per grid** to advance.  
- **TF Player** rolls gray dice (number per grid or Starfighter card). Each **hit** result may be placed on an **empty slot**, blocking it.  
- **Naboo Player** rolls 2 standard dice, sums result, and attempts to move through that numbered slot.  
  - If **blocked**, Anakin **cannot move**.  
  - If **empty**, Anakin moves to next space.  
- **Either way, Anakin’s turn ends after one attempt**.

#### Starfighter Cards  
- TF may play Starfighter cards (via action card) **faceup on top of a grid**.  
- Multiple cards can be stacked on one grid.  
- When Anakin moves through a card-covered grid:  
  - The **top card is removed**.  
  - Anakin must then attempt the grid or next card beneath.  
- This continues until Anakin clears all cards and the grid, or is blocked.  
- Used Starfighter cards are **discarded and not reused**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when **one player meets their win condition**.

**Naboo Victory**  
- **Destroy the Droid Control Ship** (Anakin successfully clears all grids and reaches final space).  
- **AND** have **a majority of characters (at least 3)** in the **throne room**.

**Trade Federation Victory**  
- Reduce the number of Naboo pieces in the palace to **2 or fewer**.

Note: Both conditions must be checked at the moment the Droid Control Ship is destroyed. If Naboo fails to have 3 in throne room at that time, TF wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can bonus cards be played out of order?**  
  No. Bonus cards are played **after** the 4 main action cards, in the order they were collected.  
- **What happens if a player cannot draw cards?**  
  They draw as many as possible. Play continues.  
- **Can Jedi/Sith attack through doors?**  
  No. They must be adjacent or have unblocked LOS. Doors block LOS.  
- **Can Anakin move multiple times per turn?**  
  No. Anakin attempts **one movement per turn** — roll, resolve, turn ends.  
- **What if all slots on a grid are blocked?**  
  Anakin cannot advance until TF removes some blocks (e.g., by discarding cards).  
- **Can a character attack after using window ledge movement?**  
  Yes, as long as it hasn’t already attacked that action.  
- **Does killing a decoy Queen reduce Palace Guard movement?**  
  No. Only the **real Queen’s death** triggers movement reduction.
