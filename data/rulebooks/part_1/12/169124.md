### 1. Lore & Objective

Flick 'em Up! is a flicking-based tabletop game set in the Wild West. Players take on the roles of lawmen or outlaws in a variety of scenarios involving shootouts, heists, rescues, and duels. The overarching theme is fast-paced, tactical flicking combat where precision and strategy determine victory.

Each scenario presents unique objectives for the two teams (lawmen and outlaws). Examples include eliminating key targets, stealing gold, rescuing hostages, or defending town buildings. Victory is achieved by completing scenario-specific goals or by outlasting the opposing team when the clock strikes 12:00.

### 3. Setup

1. **Choose Playing Surface**  
   - Flat, smooth, and large enough to accommodate all pieces  
   - Accessible from all sides  
   - Pieces must slide easily

2. **Choose a Scenario**  
   - Refer to the 10-scenario booklet  
   - Each scenario provides:  
     - Story and objectives  
     - Map layout  
     - Starting positions  
     - Clock time and hat color  
     - Special rules and victory conditions

3. **Form Teams**  
   - 2–10 players split into two teams: lawmen and outlaws  
   - Teams should be as equal as possible  
   - With odd numbers, one team has one extra player

4. **Prepare Components**  
   - Place team boxes near the play area  
   - Equip each cowboy with a numbered hat matching their tile  
   - Set town hall clock to the scenario-specified time (e.g., 6:00)  
   - Orient hats to the starting color (e.g., red side up)  
   - Place figures, buildings, and tokens according to scenario layout

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow

- The game proceeds in **rounds**, each representing one hour on the town hall clock  
- A round ends when all available cowboys have played  
- The clock advances one hour after each round

#### Turn Order

- Each team determines its own internal turn order (Player 1, 2, etc.)  
- Play alternates between teams  
- The first turn of each round is taken by the cowboy holding the **initiative token ("Pretzel")**  
- That cowboy’s team’s first player must use that cowboy  
- Then, the other team chooses any of their available cowboys  
- Teams alternate until all available cowboys have played

> Note: If a team takes the last turn of a round and also has the initiative in the next round, they may take two turns in a row.

#### Cowboy Availability

- Cowboys are available if their hat color matches the current clock hour color  
  - Clock hours alternate between red and blue  
- After a cowboy acts, flip their hat to the opposite color  
- When all hats are flipped, advance the clock and start a new round  
- Dead cowboys’ hats remain in play to maintain turn balance

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Actions

On a turn, a player may take **up to two actions** with their chosen cowboy, in any order, including:

- **Move**  
- **Shoot**  
- **Take/Drop/Exchange tokens** (only inside buildings, unless scenario says otherwise)

A player may take one action or none. After acting, flip the cowboy’s hat.

#### The Flick

- Flicking is done with one finger (index), **without thumb resistance**  
- The flick should be controlled, not a hard snap  
- Applies to movement and shooting

#### Move Action

- Replace the cowboy with the **movement disc**  
- Flick the disc in the desired direction  
- If the disc:  
  - **Does not touch any object, figure, or support block**:  
    - Movement is successful  
    - Place cowboy where disc stops  
    - Reorient cowboy as desired  
  - **Touches any object, figure, or support block, or leaves the table**:  
    - Movement fails  
    - Return cowboy to starting position  
    - Reorient cowboy as desired  
    - Displaced objects are reset  
    - Action is lost (but second action may still be used)

#### Entering/Exiting Buildings

- **Entering**:  
  - Flick movement disc **from front** between the two support blocks  
  - Touching the inside of support blocks is allowed  
  - Success if any part of disc crosses the door line  
  - Place cowboy on one of the support blocks  
- **Exiting**:  
  - Place disc behind building, flick through support blocks  
  - Same success condition  
  - Touching supports is allowed

> Note: Entry/exit may be blocked; obstructing objects may be moved aside (but not fallen cowboys)

#### Shoot Action

- Place a **bullet (gray disc)** to the left or right of the cowboy (1 bullet distance)  
- Flick the bullet toward an enemy cowboy  
- A **hit** occurs if the bullet **knocks the cowboy over** (no ricochet required, but must hit first)  
  - If bullet hits multiple cowboys, only the first is hit  
  - Fallen cowboys cannot be hit again until stood up  
  - Hitting a teammate causes same effect

#### Consequences of Being Hit

- Lose 1 hit point (place token in team box)  
- Cowboy remains **fallen**  
- Stands up when next activated  
- If last hit point is lost:  
  - Remove cowboy and tile to team box  
  - Place carried items on Undertaker’s support blocks  
  - Place hat in matching box slot, color side up  
  - If the cowboy had the initiative token, transfer it to the shooter

> Dead cowboys still “play” each round to maintain turn count — no actions, just flip hat

#### Shooting with Two Pistols

- A cowboy with 2+ pistols may shoot **two bullets in one action**  
  - One bullet per side  
  - Flicked one after the other  
- Cannot shoot more than twice even with 3 pistols

#### Shooting from Inside a Building

- Place bullet behind the building  
- Flick through the door (between support blocks)  
- All standard shooting rules apply

#### Take/Drop/Exchange Tokens

- Only allowed **inside a building** (unless scenario says otherwise)  
- Cowboy may:  
  - Take a token (place in inventory)  
  - Drop a token (place on support block)  
  - Exchange one token for another (counts as one action)  
- Maximum of **2 tokens per cowboy**  
- To take a **facedown token**, flip it — action is used regardless of whether it is taken

#### Dynamite (Scenario 4+)

- Use the **red octagon**  
- Flick it like a bullet  
- Upon stopping, it **explodes** in a radius of one movement disc  
  - Cowboys in range: lose 1 HP, knocked over  
  - Cowboys in buildings: lose 1 HP, placed in front of either support block, knocked over  
  - Objects/buildings in range: removed from play  
- Dynamite is removed after explosion

#### Winchester Rifle (Scenario 6+)

- Requires **rifle barrel** and bullet  
- Place barrel next to cowboy (1 bullet distance)  
- Aim barrel toward target  
- Place bullet in barrel and flick  
- Only way to use the rifle

#### Duels (Scenario 2+)

- Triggered when opposing cowboys occupy the same building  
- Move dueling cowboys to a **reserved duel area**  
- Player who entered last shoots first  
- Miss? Opponent advances (width of movement disc) and shoots  
- Alternate until one is hit  
- Winner ejects loser from building (flick cowboy through door)  
- If more than two cowboys duel:  
  - All on one team shoot/advance before the other team responds  
  - Duel ends when only one team remains

#### Special Figures & Rules

- **Hostage (Scenario 8)**:  
  - Attached to escorting cowboy  
  - Moves with cowboy during move action  
  - If cowboy is hit, hostage transfers to closest standing cowboy  
  - Cannot be shot — doing so causes **immediate loss** for the shooter’s team

- **Witness (Scenario 7)**:  
  - Neutral figure, part of lawmen team  
  - Can’t shoot or carry weapons  
  - Only one who can pick up **facedown evidence**  
  - If killed before both evidence pieces are found, outlaws win

- **Gallows (Scenario 9)**:  
  - Old Man Cooper starts on barrel  
  - Outlaws free him by **shooting with a rifle** to knock him down  
  - Closest outlaw escorts him if standing  
  - Lawmen can recapture and return him to gallows

- **Onslaught (Scenario 10)**:  
  - Outlaws have only 1 HP  
  - When killed, they respawn outside town with 1 HP  
  - Carried items are lost

#### Special Powers (Variant)

- Flip cowboy tile to activate power:
  - **Ricochet**: Bullet may bounce off objects before hitting a cowboy  
  - **Mulligan**: Once per turn, retry a failed movement flick

### 6. Scoring & End Game

The game ends when:

- A **scenario objective is met**, or  
- The **clock strikes 12:00 (midnight or high noon)**

Victory depends on the scenario:

| Scenario | Lawmen Win If | Outlaws Win If |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Kill 3 outlaws | Kill 3 lawmen |
| 2 | Kill Big Daddy Cooper | Kill the Sheriff |
| 3 | 7+ gold in Bank | 7+ gold in Saloon |
| 4 | Outlaws fail to exit with 5 gold | Outlaws carry all 5 gold outside town |
| 5 | ≥2 clean barrels at midnight | ≥3 poisoned barrels at end of any round |
| 6 | Eliminate 3 enemies OR have 4+ enemies down/killed at round end | Same as lawmen |
| 7 | Deliver 2 evidence to Sheriff’s Office | Witness dies or clock hits 12 |
| 8 | Daughter in Sheriff’s Office OR with lawman at 12 | Daughter with outlaw at 12 |
| 9 | Old Man Cooper hanged at 12 | Old Man Cooper with outlaw at 12 |
| 10 | (Two-phase) Most surviving lawmen after both phases | — (team scores compared) |

Tiebreakers vary by scenario (e.g., remaining hit points, number of kills).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Flick technique**: Use index finger only; no thumb or table resistance  
- **Finger hits object**: Reset all displaced pieces  
- **Reorienting cowboy**: Counts as a move action  
- **Entering buildings**: Must be from the front; touching inner supports allowed  
- **Multiple cowboys in building**: Max 2 per team; duel starts immediately if enemy enters  
- **Fallen cowboy blocking door**: Cannot be moved; must be shot or flicked away  
- **Bullet hits cowboy then cactus**: Still a valid hit  
- **Hostage placement**: In front or behind escort (player’s choice)  
- **Two pistols in duel**: Yes, shoot twice per turn  
- **Picking up tokens**: One per action; flipping facedown token uses action  
- **Duel during turn**: Does not cost an action; cowboy still gets second action after  
- **Ejected cowboy hits object**: Object stays in new position  
- **Knocked-over barrel**: Stand it up; return tokens on top  
- **Moving object to enter building**: Leave it aside; do not return
