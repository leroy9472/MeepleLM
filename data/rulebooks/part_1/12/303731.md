Victory is achieved by strategically managing stamina, card sequences, positioning, and timing attacks while responding to the monster’s dynamic behavior patterns.

- Hunter boards and miniatures  
- Combat board with four sectors (front, rear, left/right flank)

- Behavior deck and behavior cards  
- Action decks (one per hunter)  
- Attrition deck

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Sequence**: Up to 5 cards played during Action Phase. Order matters for triggers.  
- **Stamina**: Paid by discarding cards (1 stamina per ↓ icon) or using Stamina tokens.  
- **Threatened**: Gain token if you don’t move. During Attrition, draw 2 cards and use worst outcome. Discard when moving.  
- **Aggro**: Player with aggro token goes first each round. Gained by playing Aggro cards or Taunting.  
- **Struggle**: Monster resource. At ≥3 per player, triggers Unleash (all players suffer monster damage, struggle reduced to 1 per player).  
- **Behavior Cards**: Trigger based on specific conditions (see Reaction Icons).  
- **Wounds**: Monster suffers a wound when damage ≥ toughness (on stance card). Reduces health by 1.  
- **Terrain Effects**:  
  - **Water**: Max sequence = 3.  
  - **Fire**: Cannot play cards. Flips from red → yellow → removed.  
  - **Brush**: Hide to pause turn; resume after another player’s turn.  
  - **Plateau**: Cancel behavior card and perform Riding Check.  
  - **Rock**: Prevent attrition damage.  
  - **Cyricae**: +weapon level damage when playing Attack card.  
  - **Baethanis**: Heal weapon level at start of turn.  
  - **Synaea**: Pay weapon level damage to draw 1.  
  - **Wildmaw**: Suffer weapon level damage at end of turn if threatened.  
- **Riding Check**:  
  1. Reveal top attrition card and top action card.  
  2. Compare attrition value vs. stamina icons on action card.  
  3. If stamina ≥ attrition: deal weapon damage, place in any sector.  
  4. Else: suffer monster damage, place in front sector.  
  5. Discard both cards.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition**: Reduce monster health to 0.  
- **Lose Conditions**:  
  - All hunters KO’d.  
  - Specific monster abilities cause instant loss (e.g., Morkraas in Stance 3 if Unleash occurs).  
- **KO Rules**:  
  - When damage ≥ total health (non-depleted equipment), player is KO’d.  
  - Remove damage/tokens, discard hand and sequence, add Wound card, deplete armor or helm, lay miniature down, give aggro to next standing player.  
  - At start of next turn: flip KO token (red → white).  
  - At start of following turn: remove token, draw hand, stand up, resume play.
