## River Valley: Glassworks – Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the serene River Valley, colorful glass fragments carried by the river have drawn clever woodland creatures eager to build thriving glassworks. As a player, you run a glassworks business, gathering glass from the river to fill your inventory. Your goal is to strategically collect and arrange glass pieces to maximize your victory points (VP) at the end of the game. The player with the highest score wins.

- F: 1 First Player Marker  
- G: 132 Glass Pieces, by color:  
  - 22 white

3. Setup  
1. Place all colored glass pieces in the bag, **excluding black**. Add black pieces **only if playing with 5 players**.  
2. Place the playmat in the center of the play area.  
3. Randomly place the 6 river tiles on the 6 designated spaces on the playmat.  
4. Draw glass pieces from the bag and place them on each river tile, matching the number of stones (Ⓞ) shown on the tile.  
5. Fill the lake (end of the river) with 5 glass pieces drawn from the bag.  
6. Each player:  
   - Assembles their glassworks board (solo side face down).  
   - Takes the matching character pawn and places it on the first space of their inventory track.  
   - Takes a pan and draws 3 glass pieces from the bag into it.  
7. The player who most recently saw a real river takes the first player marker.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Players take turns in clockwise order.  
- On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:  
  A. **Place & Gather**: Place glass from your pan onto a river tile, then gather glass from an adjacent tile.  
  B. **Draw**: Take 4 glass pieces from the lake into your pan.  
- After resolving the action, the turn passes clockwise.  
- The game ends when a player reaches or passes 17 on their inventory track (see Game End).

5. Core Mechanics  
**Place & Gather Action**  
1. Choose 1 glass piece from your pan.  
   - Place it on a river tile that has a matching **shape** in one of its corners.  
   - Then, gather **all** glass pieces from **one adjacent river tile** (not the lake).  
2. **OR**, place **2 glass pieces of the same shape** on **any** river tile (shape need not match corner), then gather from one adjacent river tile as above.  
3. After gathering:  
   - Remove the now-empty river tile and place it at the start of the river (farthest from the lake).  
   - Shift all other river tiles forward to fill the gap.  
   - Refill the now-last tile with glass pieces from the bag equal to the number of stones (●) on it.  
4. Add all gathered glass pieces to your **glassworks** (not your pan).  
5. Move your character pawn forward on your inventory track by the number of pieces added.

**Adding to Your Glassworks**  
- When adding glass:  
  - **New color**: Place it in the next empty **column** (left to right). You may choose the order if adding multiple new colors.  
  - **Existing color**: Add to the matching column, filling **bottom to top**.  
- If a column is full or you already have 7 different colors, any excess or new 8th (or 9th) color goes to **overflow**.  
- Overflow holds excess glass; these pieces cannot be used and will penalize scoring.

**Draw Action**  
1. Take **4 glass pieces** from the lake and add them to your **pan**.  
2. Your pan holds a maximum of **5 pieces**.  
   - If you exceed 5, place excess pieces of your choice into **overflow**.  
3. Immediately refill the lake back to **5 pieces** from the bag.

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Trigger**  
- When a player reaches or passes **17** on their inventory track, the game enters final rounds.  
- All players with fewer than 3 pieces in their pan draw from the bag until they have 3.  
- Finish the current round (all players have taken the same number of turns).  
- Then, each player takes **1 final turn**.  
- After final turns, proceed to scoring.

**Final Scoring**  
1. **Score All Rows** (bottom to top):  
   - Each row scores VP based on the number of **consecutive filled spaces from the left**.  
   - If the first space is empty, the row scores **0 VP**.  
   - Row VP values are listed at the bottom of the glassworks grid.  
2. **Score Tallest 2 Columns**:  
   - Identify the two tallest filled columns (by number of pieces).  
   - In case of ties, score the **leftmost** columns first.  
   - Each selected column scores VP equal to the value on its **highest filled space**.  
3. **Score Overflow**:  
   - Lose **3 VP** for **each** piece in overflow.  
- Total score = Row VP + Column VP – Overflow penalty.  
- Highest score wins. In case of a tie, players share victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Does shape matter when adding to the glassworks?**  
  A: No. Only **color** matters when placing in the glassworks. Shape only matters when placing in the river.  
- **Q: Can I gather from the lake?**  
  A: No. The lake is not a river tile. You can only gather from river tiles.  
- **Q: Can I gather from a tile with no glass?**  
  A: Yes. You may choose any adjacent tile, even if empty. You simply gather nothing.  
- **Q: What if the bag runs out during river refill?**  
  A: The rules do not specify. Assume the game is designed to avoid this; if it occurs, refill as many as possible.  
- **Q: Can I choose which glass to add when gathering multiple colors?**  
  A: When adding new colors, you **choose the order** in which to place them in empty columns.  
- **Q: What happens to glass in overflow?**  
  A: It stays there until scoring, where it incurs a 3 VP penalty each. It cannot be used.  
- **Q: Can I place 2 different shapes on a tile for the “2 same shape” option?**  
  A: No. You must place **2 pieces of the same shape** to use that option.
