### 1. Lore & Objective
Each player controls a wizard moving through a maze. The objective is to score 2 Victory Points (VPs) or be the last wizard alive. VPs are earned by killing enemy wizards or capturing and returning their treasures to your home base.

### 2. Components
- Wizard figures and colored bases  
- Sector boards (with sides A and B)  
- Life dials (track 15 starting life, max 20)  
- Treasure markers (2 per player)  
- Hat tokens (identify ownership of spells/objects)  
- Crack, energy, and stun tokens  
- Portal tokens  
- Random direction overlay and die  
- Magic cards: Attack, Counter, Energy, Item, Neutral (from selected schools)  
- Object markers (e.g., stone blocks, thornbushes, walls, doors)

### 3. Setup
1. Each player chooses a wizard and colored base, then takes matching sector board, life dial, treasure markers, and hat tokens.  
2. All players agree to use side A or B of the sector boards. Shuffle boards under the table and build the map based on player count (per rulebook diagrams). Place portals as shown.  
3. Place wizard in home base (magical circle) and one treasure in each treasure start square.  
4. Set aside 12 White Cantrip cards; return Black Cantrip cards to the box (unless using Custom Spellbook).  
5. Select three additional magic schools (e.g., Alchemy, Elemental, Mentalism). Shuffle these with White Cantrips to form the Magic Deck. Return unused cards to the box.  
6. Deal 5 cards to each player.  
7. Set life tracker to 15. Randomly choose starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn has three phases:

**1. Time Passes Phase**  
- Resolve "when time passes" effects on maintained spells.  
- Remove 1 energy token from each maintained temporary spell. If last token is removed, discard the spell.  
- If stunned, discard 1 stun token and remain stunned for the turn.

**2. Move and Cast Phase**  
- Spend Movement Points (base 3) to move orthogonally (not diagonally).  
- Make one attack (not on first turn).  
- Play/use Magic Cards in any order.  
- Optional: Boost speed once per turn by discarding an Energy card or card with energy value. Gain movement equal to the energy value.  
- Wizards may move through or end in a square with another wizard.  
- Wrap-around: Exiting one edge re-enters opposite edge. Portals connect matching colors.

**3. Discard and Draw Phase**  
- Discard any number of cards.  
- Draw up to 2 cards, not exceeding hand limit (usually 7).  
- Reshuffle discard pile if deck runs out.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Movement**  
- Base speed: 3 MP.  
- 1 MP to move orthogonally.  
- Doors in home sector are always unlocked; others require spells to open.  
- Open doors may be held open during your turn; they re-lock when you leave.  
- No MP cost to open or pass through doors.

**Attacking**  
- One attack per turn (not on first turn).  
- Attack via:  
  - Attack spell (counts as attack)  
  - Punch (adjacent or same square, 1 physical damage)  
  - Item (e.g., dagger)  
- Target declares attack; defender may play Counter spell.  
- Stunned wizard may move OR attack, not both. If attacking, cannot leave square voluntarily.

**Magic Cards**  
- **Types**: Attack, Counter, Energy, Item, Neutral.  
- **Range**:  
  - Caster: self only  
  - Adjacent: same or adjacent square, within LOS  
  - Within LOS: visible target, any distance  
  - Anywhere: no LOS or distance requirement  
- **Duration**:  
  - Instant: resolves and discards  
  - Temporary: place in play with energy tokens; maintain each turn  
  - Permanent: stays in play until discarded  
- **Boosting**: Discard Energy card to replace spell’s energy (not add). Affects duration or effect if specified.

**Line of Sight (LOS)**  
- Trace line between center dots of caster and target.  
- Walls (including columns) block LOS.  
- LOS through portals or wrap-around treats connected squares as adjacent.  
- LOS through objects, treasures, wizards, or creatures is allowed unless they "fill the entire square."

**Objects**  
- Inanimate items: walls, doors, stone blocks, dropped items.  
- Mobile objects (round markers) can be picked up (1 MP).  
- Immobile objects (square markers) fixed.  
- Carried items count toward hand size.  
- Dropping items costs no MP.

**Treasures**  
- Pick up in current square (ends Move and Cast Phase).  
- Carry one treasure at a time (insert marker into base).  
- Drop in current square (no MP cost).  
- Stealing enemy treasure and dropping it in your home base scores 1 VP (lost if moved).

**Damage & Destruction**  
- 3 damage = 1 crack on object.  
- Stone wall: 5 cracks to destroy.  
- Door: 3 cracks to destroy.  
- Outer walls, treasures, and unspecified objects: indestructible.  
- Destroyed walls: place destroyed wall marker.

**Stunned Wizards**  
- May move OR attack, not both.  
- If attacks, cannot leave square voluntarily.  
- Other actions (picking up objects, casting non-attack spells) allowed.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Win Conditions** (immediate win):  
- Score 2 VPs.  
- Be the only wizard alive.

**VP Sources**:  
- Killing enemy wizard: 1 VP (direct attack only). Take cards from hand.  
- Enemy treasure in your home base: 1 VP (lost if treasure is moved).

**Death**:  
- Wizard reduced to 0 or less life is eliminated.  
- All carried items dropped where died.  
- Maintained spells discarded.  
- Treasure markers remain in play.  
- Indirect death (e.g., Wall of Fire) grants no VP.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Doors**: Must have LOS to center of door to target. Held open only during caster’s turn.  
- **Picking up treasure**: No MP cost, but ends Move and Cast Phase.  
- **Picking up objects**: Costs 1 MP.  
- **Dropping objects**: No MP cost.  
- **Multiple Counters**: May play multiple counters to same spell; resolve in turn order (active player first).  
- **Spell Types**: Card used as one type (e.g., Pain Link as Counter is a Counter for duration).  
- **Wall of Fire**: Blocks LOS.  
- **Featherweight**: “Back” means away from attacker. Cannot open doors while being pushed.  
- **Visionstone**: Works through one wall and two connected columns. Not through outer edges.  
- **Lightning Bolt**: One attack/source; damage reduced as whole. Bounces off walls.  
- **Mist Body**: Cannot be attacked, but can be damaged by non-attack effects (e.g., Destroy Wall).  
- **Big Man Form**: Blocks movement/passage; Lightning Bolt ends when hitting wizard.  
- **Wall of Earth**: Played in response to attack; blocks LOS and spell effects for duration of attack.
