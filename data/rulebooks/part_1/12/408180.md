## Evergreen Farms — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The goal of Evergreen Farms is to make the Moon self-sustaining in terms of food by building greenhouses and farms within the lunar base. Players expand agricultural infrastructure to claim scoring goals based on farm presence and structural dominance.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Evergreen Farms Corporation Board  
- 18 Plant Tokens (12 of value 1, 6 of value 3)  
- 9 Evergreen Project Cards  
- 5 Evergreen Farms Corporation Tokens  
- 12 Farm Tiles (4 of each size: 1, 2, 3)  
- 1 Evergreen Farms Storage Box  
- 1 Evergreen Farms Reference Card (Solo Mode)  
- 1 Corporation Sheet

### 3. Setup  
- Place Plant Tokens next to the main board.  
- Sort Farm Tiles by size and place them on corresponding spaces on the Evergreen Farms board.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Evergreen Farms integrates into the main game’s three phases per round:  
- **Shuttle Phase**: No specific Evergreen action.  
- **Action Phase**: Players may use Corporation Actions or Project abilities tied to Evergreen.  
- **Maintenance Phase**: Triggers benefits when retrieving astronauts from the crater.

#### Corporation Token  
- When activated, gain 2 Plants.  
- Plants are unlimited; use substitutes if supply runs out.

#### Corporation Action  
- Spend 1/3/5 Plants to build a Farm of size 1/2/3 in a sector where you already have a structure.  
- After placing the Farm, mine the resource (Titanium or Rare Earth) of that sector.

**Example**: Nestore spends 3 Plants to place a size 2 Farm in a sector with his Laboratory. He places the Farm and gains 1 Titanium from the sector.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Maintenance Phase – Farm Benefits  
When retrieving astronauts from the crater (after Corporation Maintenance), the player who gains an astronaut also gains benefits from Farms in that row, regardless of whether they can house the astronaut.

- **Size 1 Farm**: Gain 1 VP  
- **Size 2 Farm**: Gain 1 Reputation  
- **Size 3 Farm**: Gain 2 VP

**Example**: Nestore retrieves an Engineer. The row contains a size 3, size 2, and size 1 Farm. He gains 2 VP (from size 3), 1 Reputation (from size 2), and 1 VP (from size 1) = 4 VP and 1 Reputation.

#### Claiming Goals  
At the end of your turn, you may claim any available Evergreen Farms goal if you meet the conditions.

**Goals**:
- Have a majority of **structure size** in a row with at least a **total Farm size of 4**: score 4 VP (2 VP in 2-player game; 2 VP slot not claimable in 2-player).
- Have a majority of **structure size** in a row with at least a **total Farm size of 5**: score 8 VP (6 VP in 3-player game; 6 VP slot not claimable in 2- or 3-player).
- Have a majority of **structure size** in a row with at least a **total Farm size of 7**: score 12 VP (10 VP in 2-player game; 10 VP slot not claimable in 2-player).

**Note**: "Majority of structure size" means your total structure sizes in the row exceed all other players'.  
**Example**: Nestore has total structure size 6 (Dome, Lab, Workshop); Matthieu has 1 (Dome). Total Farm size = 6 → Nestore claims the medium goal (8 VP).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **During Game**: Score VP when claiming goals.  
- **Maintenance Phase**: Gain VP and Reputation from Farms when retrieving astronauts.  
- **Endgame**: No additional Evergreen-specific endgame scoring.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q**: Can I build a Farm in a sector without a Solar Panel?  
  **A**: Yes, as long as you have a structure there. Powering is not required for Farms.  
- **Q**: Do Farms produce resources?  
  **A**: No. They only enable mining during the Corporation Action and trigger benefits during Maintenance.  
- **Q**: Can I claim multiple Evergreen goals in one turn?  
  **A**: No. You may claim multiple goals at the end of a turn, but only **one per corporation** during the entire game.  
- **Q**: What if two players tie in structure size?  
  **A**: You must have a **strict majority** to claim a goal. Ties prevent claiming.
