## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Players take on the role of cat ladies collecting cats, food, toys, costumes, and catnip. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VP) by strategically gathering cards and feeding cats. Unfed cats penalize the player. The player with the highest VP wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most fed cats wins. If still tied, the first to win the next game wins.

2. **Components**  
- 102 Game cards  
- 13 Stray cat cards  
- 6 Victory point tokens (each worth 2 VP)  
- 1 Cat token  
- 60 Food cubes:  
  - 20 Chicken (red)  
  - 20 Tuna (blue)  
  - 15 Milk (white)  
  - 5 Wild (purple)  
- 1 Rulebook  

3. **Setup**  
- Shuffle the 13 Stray Cat cards into a face-down deck. Reveal 3 face-up beside the play area.  
- Prepare the main deck:  
  - **2 players**: Remove all cards marked "3+" and "4"; then randomly remove and discard 2 more.  
  - **3 players**: Remove all cards marked "4"; then randomly remove and discard 2 more.  
  - **4 players**: Use all cards; no removal.  
- Shuffle the main deck and deal 9 cards face up in a 3x3 grid.  
- Place food cubes, cat token, and VP tokens off to the side.  
- The player with the most real-life cats goes first.  
- The player to their right places the cat token next to one row or column (blocking it).  

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
On your turn:  
1. **Take a row or column**: Choose an entire row or column (3 cards) from the 3x3 grid, **except** the one the cat token is adjacent to.  
2. **Resolve cards**:  
   - **Cat cards**: Place in front of you.  
   - **Food cards**: Discard and take 1 food cube (or 2 if x2 food card). Wild food = 1 purple cube.  
   - **Costume cards**: Keep in hand.  
   - **Catnip cards**: Keep in hand.  
   - **Toy cards**: Keep in hand.  
   - **Lost Cat cards**: Keep in hand.  
   - **Spray Bottle cards**: Keep in hand.  
3. **Move cat token**: Place it next to the row or column you just took.  
4. **Refill**: Draw 3 cards from the main deck to refill the emptied row or column.  
5. **Optional actions (anytime during your turn)**:  
   - Play 2 Lost Cat cards to:  
     - Gain 1 face-up Stray Cat (add to your cats)  
     - OR gain 1 VP token (worth 2 VP)  
   - Play 1 Spray Bottle card to move the cat token to any row or column (blocking it).  

Turn passes clockwise. Game ends when a row/column must be refilled but the deck is empty.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Feeding Cats**: At game end, each cat must be fully fed using food cubes.  
  - Fully fed: Gain VP as shown on card.  
  - Not fed: Lose 2 VP (no partial credit).  
- **Food Types**: Chicken (C), Tuna (T), Milk (M). Wild cubes can substitute any.  
- **Cat Colors**: Black (B), Orange (O), White (W). Some cats score based on color combos.  
- **Special Cat Abilities** (only if fully fed):  
  - **Cow**: 2 VP per food cube fed to her (any number allowed).  
  - **Waffle**: Feed 1–4 food of **one type** (C, T, M); worth 3 VP per food.  
  - **Bronte**: 2 VP per other cat fed that eats the same food type as her.  
  - **Sir Cuddleface**: 4 VP per set of B, O, W cats fed.  
  - **Black Cat**: 2 VP per Black cat fed.  
  - **Orange Cat**: 2 VP per Orange cat fed.  
  - **White Cat**: 2 VP per White cat fed.  
  - **Zoroaster**: 2 VP per Costume.  
  - **Macak**: Counts as an extra Catnip.  
  - **LeVar Purrton**: Multi-colored; counts as all colors.  
  - **Florence, Antoinette, Eliot**: Score for themselves based on color.  
  - **Hemingway**: 7 VP if you feed the most cats; otherwise 3 VP.  
- **Costumes**:  
  - Most costumes: +6 VP (shared if tied).  
  - 0 costumes: –2 VP.  
- **Catnip**:  
  - 1 catnip: –2 VP  
  - 2–3 catnip: +1 VP per fully fed cat  
  - 4+ catnip: +2 VP per fully fed cat  
- **Toys**: Score per unique set:  
  - 1 unique toy: 1 VP  
  - 2 unique toys: 3 VP  
  - 3 unique toys: 5 VP  
  - Multiple sets allowed.  
- **Stray Cats**: Must be fed like regular cats. Acquired by discarding 2 Lost Cat cards.  
- **Lost Cat Cards**: Discard 2 to gain a Stray Cat or a VP token. Worth nothing otherwise.  
- **Spray Bottles**: Play to move cat token (block a row/column). Worth nothing otherwise.  
- **Food Penalty**: Player(s) with the **most** leftover food after feeding lose 2 VP (all tied players lose 2 VP).

6. **Scoring & End Game**

Final scoring:  
1. Feed all cats. Unfed cats: –2 VP each.  
2. Score fed cats (including stray cats) using their abilities.  
3. Apply food penalty: Most leftover food → –2 VP (all ties included).  
4. Score costumes:  
   - Most → +6 VP (shared)  
   - 0 → –2 VP  
5. Score catnip based on count and number of fully fed cats.  
6. Score toys by unique sets.  
7. Score VP tokens: +2 VP each.  
8. Total all VP.  
Winner: Highest total. Tiebreakers:

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can I take partial food?** No. Cats must be fully fed or score –2 VP. No partial feeding.  
- **Can wild food cubes be split across different cats?** Yes. Wild cubes are flexible.  
- **Can I play multiple spray bottles in one turn?** Yes, if you have them. Each allows one move of the cat token.  
- **Can I play Lost Cat cards on the same turn I acquire them?** Yes.  
- **Do stray cats count toward fed cat totals for abilities?** Yes.  
- **Do unfed cats count toward color totals?** No. Only fed cats count for abilities.  
- **Can I use food cubes to feed a cat more than required?** Yes, but excess doesn’t help (except for Cow and Waffle).  
- **Is the cat token ever moved outside of a player’s turn?** No. Only via Spray Bottle or after taking a row/column.  
- **What if the main deck runs out but no row/column is empty?** Game continues until a refill is needed and impossible.  
- **Can I use Spray Bottle to unblock the row I want to take?** Yes, during your turn before taking cards.
