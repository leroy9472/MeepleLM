## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Ecos: First Continent*, players take on the roles of primordial forces of nature shaping the first continent. Through terrain formation, forest growth, mountain raising, and species placement, each player pursues a unique vision of planetary grandeur. The game ends when a player reaches or surpasses 80 Victory Points (VP) after a Wild Element token is drawn. The player with the most VP at that moment wins.

For a shorter game, players may agree to play to 60 VP instead.

### 3. Setup  
**For 3–6 Players (Standard Setup):**  
1. Assemble and place the Score Board within view of all players. Choose scoring style (left-to-right or serpentine).  
2. Each player selects a color and takes:  
   - 1 Dial Token (placed in play area, “START” edge up)  
   - 1 Score Marker (placed on 0 of Score Board)  
   - 7 Energy Cubes (from supply)  
3. Create the initial landscape using:  
   - 1 Desert Tile  
   - 1 Grassland Tile (placed adjacent to Desert)  
   - 2 Water Tiles (one on each side of the Desert–Grassland connection)  
4. Place remaining Map Tiles in type-sorted stacks.  
5. Place Animal, Forest, and Mountain Tokens near the play area.  
6. Place all 40 Element Tokens into the Element Bag and shuffle.  
7. Determine the first Harbinger: the player who most recently took a hike. They receive the Element Bag.  
8. Prepare starting hands using one of the following methods:

#### Preset Hands (Footprint or Leaf Icons):  
- **Footprint Method (First Game):**  
  - Sort 72 animal-footprint cards into 6 piles of 12 by icon.  
  - Players randomly choose one pile as their starting hand.  
  - From this hand, identify the 3 cards with darker footprints — these are the starting active cards (placed face-up). The other 9 remain hidden in hand.  
- **Leaf Method (Subsequent Games):**  
  - Same as above, but using leaf icons on opposite side of cards.  
- Unused cards are shuffled into their respective decks (brown/blue).  

#### Drafting (Optional):  
- **Blue Cards (35 total):** Deal 5 face-down to each player. Keep 1, pass the rest left. Repeat until each has 4 blue cards.  
- **Brown Cards (70 total):** Deal 9 face-down. Keep 1, pass right. Repeat until each has 8 brown cards.  
- Combine for 12-card hand. Choose 3 to be active (face-up); rest go to hand.  
- Shuffle undrafted cards back into decks.  

#### 2-Player Game Variants:  
- Each player receives 12 brown and 6 blue cards (instead of 8 and 4).  
- Start with 5 active cards (instead of 3).  
- If using presets, choose 2 additional active cards from hand.  
- If drafting: deal 2 blue and 4 brown initially, then draft remaining cards 2 at a time.  
- Harbinger draws **2 Element Tokens per turn** (instead of 1).  

Preset deck pairings for 2P:  
- Lion vs. Antelope  
- Rhino vs. Gorilla  
- Gorilla/Bird of Paradise vs. Impala Lily  
- Daisy vs. Aloe

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- There are no turns. Play proceeds in rounds defined by Element Token draws.  
- The **Harbinger** draws Element Tokens from the bag and announces them.  
- All players act **simultaneously** in response to each Element drawn.

**Per Element Token Draw, Each Player Must Choose One:**  
1. **Place 1 Energy Cube:**  
   - Place one Energy Cube from personal supply onto a matching element icon on an active card.  
   - If no cubes are available, move a cube from another card and place it (following rules).  
2. **Rotate Dial Token 90° Clockwise:**  
   - Required if unable to place a cube. Optional otherwise.

After all players act:  
- Any active card with all Energy Cube spots filled is **completed** (“ECO!”).  
- Resolve completed cards in **clockwise order**, starting with Harbinger.  
- After resolution, Harbinger draws next Element Token.  

**Wild Element Token:**  
- Allows players to place a cube on **any** Energy spot (matching any element).  
- After resolution of all effects:  
  - Check if any player has ≥80 VP (or 60 in short game).  
    - If yes, game ends after this round.  
    - If no, return all Element Tokens to bag, shuffle, and pass bag to player on Harbinger’s left (new Harbinger).  
  - Play continues.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Completing a Card ("ECO!")  
When a player fills the last Energy spot on a card:  
1. Announce “ECO!”  
2. When it’s their turn to resolve (clockwise from Harbinger):  
   - Remove all Energy Cubes from the card to personal supply.  
   - Resolve effects **top to bottom**.  
   - If card has multiple leaves (uses), rotate it 90° clockwise.  
   - If only one leaf remains, discard the card.  

**Interrupt Rule:**  
- If a preceding player’s resolution changes the board state, a player may choose to **cancel** their ECO: remove the last-placed cube and rotate Dial instead.  
- Only allowed if another player resolved before them.  

**Simultaneous Resolution Exception:**  
- If a card’s effect **does not affect the board or other players**, it may be resolved immediately without waiting.  

#### Using Your Dial  
- Each time a player rotates their Dial (instead of placing a cube), it turns 90° clockwise.  
- After **2 rotations**: May reset Dial to “START” to **Gain a Card**.  
- After **3 rotations**: Must reset Dial to “START” to either:  
  - **Play a Card** (from hand to active area), or  
  - **Gain an Energy Cube** (add to personal supply).  

Resetting the Dial is **optional** after 2 rotations, but **mandatory** after 3.

#### Gaining Cards  
When gaining a card (via Dial or effect), choose one:  
- Draw 2 cards (either both from one deck or one from each), keep 1, discard the other face-up to a shared discard pile.  
- Take any 1 face-up card from the discard pile.  

**Deck Characteristics:**  
- **Brown Cards**: Focus on map building and terrain manipulation.  
- **Blue Cards**: Focus on scoring Victory Points.  

#### Playing Cards  
- Move a card from hand to active area (face-up, side with most leaves at top).  
- It becomes eligible for Energy Cube placement.  

#### Card Effects  
All effects are resolved **top to bottom**.  
If a card has a **placement effect (↓)** and you **cannot fulfill all placements**, you **cannot resolve any subsequent effects**.

##### Placing Map Tiles  
- Add a new tile so at least one edge touches an existing tile.  
- Types: Grassland, Desert, Water.  

##### Placing Mountain Tokens  
- Place on any **Land Tile (Desert or Grassland)** without an existing Mountain.  
- Cannot be placed on Water.  

##### Placing Forest Tokens  
Forest capacity depends on tile and Mountain presence:  
- **Desert, no Mountain**: 0  
- **Desert, with Mountain**: 1  
- **Grassland, no Mountain**: 1  
- **Grassland, with Mountain**: 2  

##### Placing Animal Tokens  
- Place on a tile that:  
  1. Matches the animal’s terrain requirements (via tabs on token).  
  2. Has **no other animal** on it.  
- **Exception:** If no empty valid tiles exist, may place on a valid tile **with other animals**.  

**Animal Placement Rules (from tabs):**  
- Green tab: Grassland only  
- Brown tab: Desert only  
- Blue tab: Water only  
- Multiple tabs: Any of indicated types  
- Gorilla: Any tile with a Forest  
- Leopard: Any tile with a Mountain  

##### Moving Animals  
- May move onto tiles with other animals.  
- May move onto terrain that doesn’t match their placement rules, **except**:  
  - Land-only animals cannot move to Water.  
  - Water-only animals cannot move to Land.  
- Movement is specified by card effect (number of spaces, which animals).

##### Gain an Element  
- Place an Energy Cube on any **other** active card (matching element).  
- Cannot place on the card generating the effect.  
- Instead of placing, may rotate Dial.  
- **Note:** Cube placement from Gain Element can trigger chain reactions.

##### Gain Energy Cubes  
- Take from supply and add to personal stock.  
- Players never lose Energy Cubes permanently.

##### Gain Victory Points (VP)  
- Move Score Marker up Score Board.  
- Announce reaching 80 VP (or 60) so Harbinger knows game end is imminent.

##### Impact Cards  
- Identified by **red sidebar**.  
- Can destroy or alter landscape (e.g., replace tiles, remove animals).  
- No special rules beyond effect text.  
- Announce when playing to alert other players.

##### Replacing or Removing Map Tiles  
- **Land → Water**: Remove all Mountains, Forests, and Land-only Animals.  
- **Water → Land**: Remove all Water-only Animals.  
- **Desert ↔ Grassland**: All tokens (Mountains, Forests, Animals) transfer.  
- **Remove without replacement**: All tokens on tile are removed.

#### Key Definitions  
- **Adjacent**: Within one space. Includes same tile or directly touching tiles. A tile/token is never adjacent to itself.  
- **Community**: Contiguous group of same-type Animal tokens. A single isolated animal is a community of 1. “This community” refers to the one just added to.  
- **Habitat**: Contiguous group of same-type:  
  - Mountains  
  - Forests  
  - Map Tiles (Water, Grassland, Desert)  
  A single isolated token/tile is a habitat of size 1. “This habitat” refers to the one just added to.  
- **Landmass**: Contiguous group of Land Tiles (Desert and/or Grassland). Water tiles break landmasses. “This landmass” refers to the one just added to.

#### Running Out of Tokens  
- If no tokens of required type are available, remove one from the board and place it following normal rules.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End Condition:**  
  - After a **Wild Element** is drawn and all effects resolved,  
  - And **at least one player has ≥80 VP** (or 60 in short game).  
- The game ends immediately.  
- **Winner:** Player with the most VP.  

**Tiebreaker:**  
- If tied, pass Element Bag to next player (new Harbinger).  
- Draw and resolve one more Element Token.  
- Recheck scores.  
- If still tied, repeat until one player leads.  
- **Note:** Any player can win — not just those originally tied.

**No Final Scoring Phase.** Game ends when condition is met.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a cube on a card using a Gain Element effect and then complete it the same turn?**  
  Yes, as long as the cube placement completes the card and all effects are resolved after cube removal.

- **Can I use a Gain Element effect to place a cube on a card I just played this turn?**  
  Yes, if the card has an open spot.

- **What if I complete a card that lets me gain an element, and that lets me complete another card?**  
  You may resolve the second card **immediately after** finishing the first, even mid-resolution of other players’ ECOs (if it’s your turn).

- **Can Dial effects interrupt card resolution?**  
  Yes. If gaining elements allows 3 Dial rotations, you may gain a cube or play a card **during** resolution.

- **Can I move an Energy Cube from a completed card to activate another?**  
  No — cubes are removed **before** effect resolution. However, Gain Element effects from the card can place new cubes.

- **Do I have to use all effects of a card?**  
  Yes, unless a placement effect (↓) cannot be completed — then **no** subsequent effects are resolved.

- **Can animals be stacked?**  
  No — only via placement exception when no empty valid tiles exist.
