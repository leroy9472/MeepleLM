# BRITANNIA REFERENCE MANUAL

### 1. Lore & Objective
**Lore:**  
Britannia is a historical strategy game depicting the invasions, migrations, and conflicts in Britain from 45 AD to 1085 AD, covering the Roman conquest, Anglo-Saxon settlement, Viking raids, and the Norman Conquest. Each nation represents a people group with unique historical goals and victory conditions.

**Objective:**  
Each nation earns Victory Points (VPs) through specific actions such as occupying territories, eliminating enemy units, achieving leadership titles (Bretwalda, King), and fulfilling nation-specific conditions. The player controlling multiple nations accumulates VPs across all their nations. The player with the highest total VPs at the end of Turn 16 wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each nation takes a full turn in fixed order. A turn consists of:
1. **Population Increase Phase**
2. **Invasion Phase** (place new units in sea areas)
3. **Movement Phase**
4. **Battle Phase**
5. **Victory Point Count Phase** (if applicable)
6. **Overpopulation Check**

**Major Invasion Exception:**  
During Major Invasion turns (e.g., Turn 4: Saxons), phases 3 and 4 (Movement and Battle) occur **twice**.

**Turn Sequence Example (Major Invasion):**  
1. Population Increase  
2. Invasion  
3. Movement → Battle  
4. Movement → Battle  
5. VP Count  
6. Overpopulation

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Population Increase
- At the start of a nation’s turn:
  - Count:
    - 2 points per **normal area** occupied
    - 1 point per **difficult terrain (hiland)** occupied
    - Add leftover points from previous turn (max 5 saved)
  - For every **6 points**, add **1 new army**.
  - Leftover points go to the Population Track (max 5).
- **Exceptions:** Romans, Norwegians, Normans do not gain population this way.

#### Movement
- **Normal armies:** 2 areas
- **Cavalry, Romans, or armies with a leader:** 3 areas
- **With leader:** Movement not stopped by difficult terrain
- **Straits:** Crossing consumes all movement
- **Boat Movement:** Available to certain nations; allows movement through one sea area (e.g., Picts, Saxons)
- **Overrun:** If moving armies outnumber defenders 2:1 or more, they may move through the area without stopping (non-attacking units only)
- **Stacking Limits:**
  - Normal areas: 3 units (one overstack allowed: up to unlimited)
  - Difficult terrain: 2 units (one overstack allowed: up to 4)
  - **Roman Forts and Burhs** do not count toward stacking limits

#### Battles
- Occurs when opposing armies occupy the same area after movement.
- **Simultaneous dice rolls:**
  - One die per army
  - **Hit on:**
    - Normal armies: 5+
    - Cavalry/Romans: 4+
  - **Elimination on:**
    - Normal armies: 6
    - Cavalry/Romans: 6 only
    - Defenders in difficult terrain: 6 only
  - **Leaders:** Add +1 to all allied dice rolls (no combat value alone)
- **Mixed Forces:** 6s must eliminate harder-to-hit units first (e.g., cavalry before infantry, Roman armies before forts)
- **Retreats:**
  - After combat, **defender** may retreat first, then **attacker**
  - **Defender retreats to:**
    - Adjacent area occupied only by own units, **or**
    - Adjacent vacant area not adjacent to enemy (except battle area)
  - **Attacker retreats to:** Area(s) from which they entered
- **Raider Withdrawal:** Raiders may retreat back to their starting sea area even if no land route exists

#### Overpopulation
- At the end of a nation’s turn:
  - Maximum armies = **2 × number of areas occupied**
  - Remove excess armies (player chooses), but **no area may be emptied**
- **Exceptions:** Jutes, Angles, Saxons in Turns 4 and 5 are exempt

#### Roman Forts
- Built when a Roman army is **sole occupant** of an area for the first time (even moving through)
- Acts as a normal army in combat (hit on 5+, eliminated on 6+), but:
  - **Cannot move**
  - **Not eliminated until all Roman armies in area are gone**
  - **Does not count toward stacking limit**
- Forts removed at start of Turn 6
- **Roman Roads:** Free movement between areas with Roman forts (if fort existed before current phase)

#### Submission
Nations may submit to Romans under conditions:
- **Welsh:** ≤5 areas
- **Brigantes:** ≤3 areas
- **Picts:** ≤3 areas
- **Belgae:** ≤4 areas (only in Turn 1)

**Effects:**
- Romans gain VPs for occupied areas
- Subject cannot attack Romans or other subjects
- Subject receives half population points and half VPs at Turn 5
- Romans may move through but not end turn in subject areas
- Ends at start of Turn 6

**Angles may also accept Brigante submission** (Turns 6–11), with similar effects.

#### Special Units & Mechanics
- **Saxon Burhs:**
  - Cost: 2 population points
  - Built in Turns 12–13
  - Max: 8 − number of Saxon-controlled areas
  - Count as normal armies for stacking, population, overrun
  - In Turns 14–16, losses must be applied to burhs first
- **Raider Mechanics:**
  - Raiders (italicized on Turn Record) may return to sea to score VPs
  - Must return to sea to complete raid and score points
  - Picts in Turns 4–5 may return to land of origin via sea

#### Leaders
- Appear on specified turns (e.g., Arthur in Turn 7)
- **Add +1 to all combat rolls** of nation’s armies
- **Allow 3-area movement and ignore difficult terrain**
- **Removed at start of nation’s next turn** (except Harold, William, Harald Hardrada, Svein Estrithson, who remain until death or game end)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a nation attack during a retreat?**  
  No. Retreats are non-combat movements.

- **Can raiders settle permanently?**  
  Yes. Raiders may choose to remain on land and become regular armies (forfeit raid VP).

- **Do Roman forts block movement?**  
  No. Enemy units may move through fort-occupied areas, but must stop and fight.

- **Can a nation have multiple leaders?**  
  No. Only one leader per nation at a time (except Turn 16 "Four Kings").

- **What if no nation qualifies for King?**  
  No one gains the title or VPs.

- **Can a submitted nation attack after Romans leave?**  
  Yes. Submission to Romans ends at Turn 6. Submission to Angles ends at Turn 12.

- **Are sea areas counted for population?**  
  No. Only land areas contribute to population calculation.

- **Can overstacking occur during movement?**  
  Yes. Limits are enforced only at end of movement phase, population increase, and retreats.

- **Can a leader be eliminated alone?**  
  Yes. If not accompanied by an army, the leader is removed without combat.
