- Players place starting units (Worldship, 1 Star Sloop, 1 Starfarer) on empty space nodes in reverse turn order

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Active player chooses an action (not the same as previous round)  
- Takes credits from action space (if any)  
- Performs action  
- Other players, clockwise, choose:  
  - Follow: perform same action  
  - Refresh: collect income, reset command, draw power cards up to hand limit  
  - Any Action: pay 2 command to perform any action  
- Active player passes commander token to the left  
- Repeat until game end is triggered

5. Core Mechanics  
**Actions:**  
- Move & Attack: Move a group of units (pay 1 command per region). Hazards require die roll (equal or higher to pass). End movement may trigger control, battle, or token reveal.  
- Research & Build: Place goods on building tracks (reducing future costs) or on technologies (to research). Build buildings (leftmost only) by paying credits. Buildings increase income (Cities), hand limit (Bases), command (Academies), and score VP.  
- Card Action or Diplomacy: Play action card (pay cost, meet requirements) or use diplomacy (play power cards, roll die ≤ total power to place influence).  
- Recruit: Pay unit cost to place units on controlled planet with building or with Worldship. Active player draws 2 Empire cards, keeps 1.  
- Scavenge: Active player refreshes; others may refresh or pay 1 command for any action.  

**Combat:**  
- Attacker and defender each choose up to 3 units. Bases do not count toward limit.  
- Roll dice for selected units and bases; take highest single die.  
- Add power from units and bases.  
- Both players must play power card if able (face down), reveal simultaneously, add card power.  
- Highest total wins; ties go to defender.  
- Winner gains 1 VP, places control cube (if applicable), discards card.  
- Loser may keep or discard card and draw replacement.  
- Loser retreats all units to nearest region with their control cube (or nearest empty space node).  

**Deliveries:**  
- Play delivery card when ending movement at pickup location; place cargo token.  
- Deliver by ending movement at destination; gain reward, discard card and token.  
- Cargo may be stolen in battle (winner takes card and cargo).  
- Only one delivery active per player.  

**Empire Cards:**  
- Draw when recruiting as active player.  
- Score VP when requirements are met at scoring.  
- Can be scored twice.  

**Technologies & Abilities:**  
- Cloaking: Ignore hazards when moving.  
- War Bots: Recruit War Bots during Recruit action.  
- Nanopacking/Spore Pods: Use 4 units in battle (instead of 3).  
- Bioneural Circuits: Draw +1 card when refreshing.  
- Plasma Drilling: Gain +2 credits when gaining income.  
- Quantum Sensors: Reroll 1 die per turn.  
- Medusa Drive: Move 1 extra region free when moving group with Worldship.  
- Linguistics: Gain 1 VP per ally token at scoring.  
- Bartering: Gain 1 VP per completed delivery.  
- Scavenger Bots: Pick up 1 goods token per turn while moving.  
- Parasites: Place parasite token on inhabited planet (with unit present); gain that planet's ally ability (but not VP or recruitment).  
- Enhanced Reflexes: Roll +1 die in battle.  
- Gene Splicing: Recruit allied units for 1 less credit.  
- Ansible: Keep both Empire cards when drawing 2.  
- Bioneural Network: +1 command on track.  
- Energy Matrix: +1 power when defending in battle.  
- Warp: Discard 1 Empire card to move Worldship and units to any region.  
- Quantum Editing: +1 VP per completed Empire card at scoring.  
- Worldship Lab: Gain 4 credits when gaining a technology.  
- Cybernetics: Gain 3 VP at scoring if all technologies are researched.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when last card of power deck is drawn.  
- Play continues until first player is active again, then each player gets one more turn.  
- Final scoring:  
  1. Building Tracks: 1+ VP per built building  
  2. Technologies: 1 VP per researched tech (+ bonuses from some techs)  
  3. Influence: VP for each planet where you have most (or tied) influence  
  4. Control Cubes: VP for each controlled region  
  5. Empire Cards: VP for completed cards (may be scored multiple times)  
- Colonization card may be played at any time before score card is drawn; scores VP based on buildings, influence, and control.  
- Winner: Most VP. Tiebreakers: most units, then most influence, then most credits.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you discard power cards freely?** No. Cards may only be discarded through use (combat, actions, diplomacy).  
- **Can you exceed hand limit?** Yes, only through non-refresh effects (e.g., missions). During refresh, draw only up to limit.  
- **Can you attack without moving?** Yes, pay 1 command to start battle in same region.  
- **Do bases count toward unit limit in battle?** No. Bases add 1 die and 1 power but do not count as units.  
- **Can you lose influence by attacking?** Yes. Attacking an inhabited planet (surface) removes all your influence there, regardless of outcome.  
- **Can you have multiple deliveries?** No. Only one delivery active at a time. Picking up a new one discards the old.  
- **Can you build on a planet without a control cube?** No. Must control the region (have control cube) to build.  
- **Can you build on your Worldship?** Yes. Worldship has 3–4 building spaces; some require power card discard.  
- **When do you pay power costs?** At end of turn; total all power costs (technologies, Worldship builds) and discard cards to meet total.  
- **Can you pass through another player's units?** Yes. No battle unless you end movement there and choose to attack.
