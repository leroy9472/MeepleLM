### 1. Lore & Objective
Fight through Darkness to either collect all 5 crystal shards or knock out all 5 of the Bot's characters. The Bot will pressure you and steal your crystal shards. Victory is achieved by collecting all 5 shards; defeat occurs if all your characters are knocked out.

### 2. Components
- Player faction components: 5 character cards, matching miniatures, 30 action cards, 5 colored crystal shards, colored bases
- Bot components: Solo deck (Adventuring Party and Unquiet Dead characters), 42 map cards, Summoning Stone (First Player Marker), damage tokens
- Game board (Dungeon or Ruins side)

### 3. Setup
1. Choose a player faction (not Adventuring Party or Unquiet Dead) and set up their components.
2. Position Adventuring Party character cards (Harm, Thom, Kris, Alena) in a row. Place their Unquiet Dead counterparts (Swordsman, Guard, Hermit, Maid) above them. Place Archer and Lord cards to the left of Maid.
3. Draw 10 map cards for yourself and 10 for the enemy deck.
4. Choose 5 map cards for your character starting positions (do not place on board yet).
5. Shuffle your remaining 5 map cards with the 10 enemy map cards to create a 15-card enemy deck.
6. Deal one map card to each Adventuring Party character and place their figures on the board.
7. Deal 5 map cards in a row (numbered 1-5), placing a crystal shard on each corresponding board space.
8. Place the Summoning Stone (First Player Marker) on the median-numbered card (space 3).
9. Place the remaining 6 map cards in a facedown stack near the Unquiet Dead cards.
10. Shuffle your character deck and draw 7 cards.
11. Shuffle the Adventuring Party and Unquiet Dead decks separately.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. Player turn: Reveal characters, play cards, take actions
2. End turn: Draw 3 cards (up to 7 max)
3. Enemy turn: 
   - Adventuring Party picks up crystals if on space with shards
   - Draw 2 cards from Adventuring Party deck (unless all killed)
   - For each card, the pictured character acts according to Adventurer Actions
   - If dead character drawn, draw again
   - After Adventuring Party actions, draw 1 card from Unquiet Dead deck (after first resurrection) or 2 cards (if Lord is active)
   - Resolve Unquiet Dead actions based on skull/hand symbols
   - Resolve Archer and Lord actions if active
4. Repeat until game end

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Character Revelation**: Must reveal at least one unrevealed character at start of turn
- **Crystal Collection**: Place collected shards on the character card that picked them up
- **Bot Movement**: 
  - Adventuring Party moves toward nearest crystal, then toward player characters with shards, then toward nearest player character
  - Unquiet Dead moves based on card symbols (skull/hand)
- **Combat**: 
  - Attack with appropriate cards, defender may play defense cards
  - Adventuring Party defends if drawn card matches attacked character
  - Unquiet Dead defends if drawn card has appropriate defense icon with matching symbol
- **Resurrection**: 
  - When Adventuring Party member dies, corresponding Unquiet Dead character enters play
  - Archer spawns when first resurrection occurs
  - Lord spawns when all shards are off board or all Adventuring Party members are dead
- **Regeneration**: If two identical Unquiet Dead character cards are drawn on same turn and that character was previously killed, it resurrects at Summoning Stone

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory**: Collect all 5 crystal shards
- **Defeat**: All player characters are knocked out
- Player gains no points for killing enemy characters
- Game ends immediately upon victory or defeat

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Tie Decisions**: Player makes all tie decisions
- **Climbing**: Enemy characters ignore climbing costs
- **Defense**: 
  - Adventuring Party: Draw card from their deck; if art matches attacked character, defense succeeds
  - Unquiet Dead: Draw card from their deck; if has defense icon with matching symbol (skull/hand), defense succeeds
- **Archer Activation**: Makes ranged attack against player character in line of sight, prioritizing those carrying shards. Within 2 spaces = Heavy Ranged Attack. If no targets, moves toward closest character with shard.
- **Lord Activation**: Performs Heavy Melee Attack on all player characters in same space. If none, moves toward closest shard, then toward character with shard, then toward nearest character.
- **Unquiet Dead Card Drawing**: Draw 1 card per turn normally, 2 cards per turn when Lord is active
- **Thom's Special Rule**: Heals Adventuring Party characters in same/adjacent space. If none remain, moves toward nearest crystal, then toward character with shard, then toward weakest character.
