## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the dark streets of Whitechapel, Mr. Jack hides among nine suspects while being pursued by Holmes, Watson, and their dog Toby. The game is asymmetric and lasts up to eight turns.  

- **Inspector (Investigator) Objective**: Identify Mr. Jack by eliminating all but one suspect before the end of turn 8.  
- **Mr. Jack Objective**: Collect six hourglasses by remaining hidden during the Appeal for Witnesses phase or win by default if no player achieves their goal by the end of turn 8.  

If both players meet their objectives on the same turn:  
- Before turn 8: The game continues. The Inspector wins if Mr. Jack becomes visible in a subsequent turn; Mr. Jack wins if he remains unseen until the end of turn 8.  
- On turn 8: The Inspector wins only if Mr. Jack is visible. Mr. Jack wins if he remains unseen.  

If neither player meets their objective by the end of turn 8, Mr. Jack wins.

2. Components  
- 9 double-sided street tiles (Areas): One side shows a suspect (Suspect side), the other is blank (Empty side). These form a 3×3 grid District.  
- 9 Alibi cards: Each represents one of the nine suspects and displays 0, 1, or 2 hourglasses.  
- 3 Detective tokens: Holmes, Watson, and Toby (the dog).  
- 4 double-sided Action tokens: Featuring the actions: Holmes / Watson / Dog, Joker, Rotation (×2), Exchange, and Alibi.  
- 8 double-sided Time tokens: Numbered 1–8 on one side; hourglass symbol on the reverse.  

3. Setup  
- Shuffle the 9 street tiles and place them in a 3×3 grid with the Suspect side face up. Orientation is random.  
- Place Detective tokens:  
  - Holmes adjacent to the top-left tile.  
  - Watson adjacent to the top-right tile.  
  - Toby adjacent to the center-bottom tile.  
- Rotate each of these three tiles so that a wall is adjacent to the Detective token (per setup illustration).  
- Mr. Jack draws one Alibi card secretly, notes the character (his identity), and places it face down. The remaining Alibi cards form a draw pile.  
- Place the 8 Time tokens in ascending order (1 to 8), number side up, next to the board.  
- The player starting the first turn is determined by the magnifying glass/knife icon on the Time token 1: magnifying glass = Investigator starts; knife = Mr. Jack starts.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has two stages:  
**Stage 1: The Manhunt (Action Phase)**  
- **Odd Turns (1, 3, 5, 7)**: Investigator starts.  
  1. Toss the 4 Action tokens to randomize which actions are available.  
  2. Investigator chooses one action and resolves it.  
  3. Mr. Jack chooses two of the remaining three actions and resolves them (order optional).  
  4. Investigator resolves the final action.  
- **Even Turns (2, 4, 6, 8)**: Mr. Jack starts.  
  1. Flip all 4 Action tokens to reveal the opposite sides (previously unused actions).  
  2. Mr. Jack chooses one action and resolves it.  
  3. Investigator chooses two of the remaining three actions and resolves them (order optional).  
  4. Mr. Jack resolves the final action.  

Note: Action tokens remain in place after being tossed; their reverse sides are used in the next turn.

**Stage 2: Appeal for Witnesses (Reveal Phase)**  
- Mr. Jack declares whether his character is visible to any Detective.  
  - A character is visible if in a Detective’s line of sight and not blocked by a wall or barricade.  
- Resolution:  
  - If Mr. Jack **is visible**:  
    - The Investigator flips all Suspect-side tiles that are **not** in a Detective’s line of sight to their Empty side (eliminating those suspects).  
    - The Investigator takes the current Turn token (removing it from play; Jack gains no hourglass).  
  - If Mr. Jack **is not visible**:  
    - The Investigator flips all Suspect-side tiles that **are** in a Detective’s line of sight to their Empty side.  
    - Mr. Jack takes the current Turn token and flips it to its hourglass side (adds one hourglass to his total).  

Important: When flipping tiles, maintain the original wall orientation.

5. Core Mechanics  
All actions are mandatory when chosen.  

**Action Details:**  
- **Holmes / Watson / Dog**: Move the corresponding Detective token one or two spaces clockwise around the perimeter of the District. Multiple Detectives may occupy the same space.  
- **Joker**:  
  - If chosen by the Investigator: Must move one Detective token (player’s choice) one space clockwise.  
  - If chosen by Mr. Jack: May either move one Detective one space clockwise, or choose not to move any Detective.  
- **Rotation (×2 tokens)**: Rotate any one tile 90° or 180° in either direction to alter line of sight. A tile may not be rotated more than once per turn.  
- **Exchange**: Swap the positions of any two tiles without changing their orientation.  
- **Alibi**:  
  - If chosen by the Investigator: Draw and reveal an Alibi card. If the character is still a suspect, flip their tile to the Empty side. Jack loses the hourglasses shown on the card (but only if the character was still in play).  
  - If chosen by Mr. Jack: Draw an Alibi card, keep it face down, and add its hourglass value to his total. The card is not revealed.  

**Visibility Rules:**  
- A Detective sees in straight lines along connected streets, until blocked by a wall, barricade, or edge of the board.  
- The barricade on the grey character’s tile counts as a wall.  
- Only the current Turn token is used in each round; it is either taken by the Investigator or converted to an hourglass by Mr. Jack.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Investigator Wins** when, after the Appeal for Witnesses, only one suspect remains.  
- **Mr. Jack Wins** when he accumulates **six hourglasses** from:  
  - Hourglasses on Alibi cards he has drawn during the game.  
  - Hourglass sides of Time tokens he has collected (from being unseen).  
  - Note: The initial Alibi card drawn during setup does **not** count toward the six-hourglass goal.  
- If both conditions are met on the same turn:  
  - Before turn 8: Game continues. Investigator wins if Mr. Jack becomes visible in a future turn; Mr. Jack wins if he stays hidden until turn 8 ends.  
  - On turn 8: Visibility determines the winner as described above.  
- If no player has won by the end of turn 8, Mr. Jack wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Does the setup Alibi card count toward Jack’s 6-hourglass goal?**  
  A: No. Only Alibi cards drawn during gameplay count.  

- **Q: Can a tile be rotated more than once in a single turn?**  
  A: No. Once a tile is rotated, it cannot be rotated again that turn, even by a different player or action.  

- **Q: Must a player move a Detective when choosing the Holmes/Watson/Dog action?**  
  A: Yes. The corresponding Detective must be moved 1 or 2 spaces clockwise.  

- **Q: Must the Investigator move a Detective when choosing the Joker?**  
  A: Yes. The Investigator must move one Detective one space. Mr. Jack may choose not to move.  

- **Q: When is the winner determined?**  
  A: After the Appeal for Witnesses phase. A player must meet their win condition at this point.  

- **Q: Can multiple Detectives occupy the same space?**  
  A: Yes. There is no limit.  

- **Q: Are gaslight hexes considered obstacles?**  
  A: Yes. All gaslight tiles are treated as obstacle hexes (walls).  

- **Q: Does flipping a tile during Exchange or Rotation affect visibility immediately?**  
  A: Yes, but visibility is only assessed during the Appeal for Witnesses phase, not during the Manhunt.
