## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 15th-century Tuscany, players take on the roles of influential nobles striving to develop their regions during the Italian Renaissance. By strategically placing tiles representing villages, agriculture, cities, monasteries, quarries, and more, players expand their domains, trigger special effects, and earn victory points.  

The game lasts three rounds. After each round, players score points on a shared scoring track. At the end of the third round, a final scoring occurs. The player with the most victory points on the red scoring track wins.

### 3. Setup  

#### Shared Setup:
1. Place the **scoring board** in the center.
2. Shuffle the **Region Cards** and form a draw pile; place discard pile area nearby.
3. Shuffle the **Yield Cards** and form a separate draw pile.
4. Sort the **25 square bonus tiles** into 5 face-up stacks by type.
5. Place the **8 color bonus tiles** adjacent to the scoring board, "1" side up.
6. Place **marble tokens**, **worker tokens**, and **blue hexagons** near the board.
7. Shuffle the **32 neutral beige-backed hex tiles** and place them face down in small stacks.
8. Reveal **8 neutral hex tiles** and place them face up in two rows of four in the center.

#### Per Player Setup:
Each player receives:
- 1 **player board**
- 22 **hex tiles** of their color (including starting castle)
- 2 **counters** (thin and thick) of their color
- 1 **50/100 victory point marker**
- 5 **Region Cards** (drawn secretly)
- 3 **Region boards** (one each of A, B, C)

**Setup Steps:**
1. Assemble your **Region** by placing the three Region boards (A, B, C) side-by-side, long edge to long edge. They may be rotated but must align so no row is offset by more than one hexagon.
2. Place your **starting castle** on any dark green hex within your Region.
3. Place your 21 non-starting hex tiles face down, sorted into **3 stacks of 7 tiles** on your player board (Stacks 1, 2, 3).
4. Place both **counters**:  
   - Thin counter on **50** of the inner (red) scoring track  
   - Thick counter on **50** of the outer (green) scoring track
5. Choose **1 square bonus tile** and place it next to the matching icon on your player board.  
   - If it is the **+1 Storage Space** tile, immediately advance your green track marker **2 spaces**.
6. The **youngest player** becomes the starting player and takes the **starting player card**.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **three rounds**, each ending when a player empties a specific stack of tiles. Players take turns clockwise, performing **one action per turn**.

#### Round End Triggers:
- **End of Round 1**: When any player places the **7th tile from Stack 1** (leftmost), the round ends after that turn.
- **End of Round 2**: When any player places the **7th tile from Stack 2** (middle), the round ends after that turn.
- **End of Round 3**: When any player places the **7th tile from Stack 3** (rightmost), all other players get **one final turn**, then the game ends.

After each round, **Scoring** occurs. Final scoring follows the third round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Player Actions (Choose One Per Turn):
1. **Draw Region Cards**  
   - Draw **2 Region Cards** (no hand limit).  
   - For each **+1 Region Card** bonus tile you have, draw **1 additional card**.  
   - If the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.

2. **Take a Hex Tile**  
   - Take **1 face-up neutral hex tile** from the central display and place it in your **hex storage space** on your player board.  
   - If your storage space is full, **remove the existing tile from the game** (return to box) before placing the new one.  
   - Then, **replace** the taken tile by taking the **top tile from your leftmost stack** (Stack 1, then Stack 2, then Stack 3 as stacks are emptied) and placing it **face up** in the central display.  
   - **Special Rule – 5-of-a-Color**:  
     If placing a tile causes **5 tiles of the same type** (e.g., 5 villages) to be visible in the central display, **remove all 5** and replace them with **5 new neutral tiles** from the face-down stack. Repeat if necessary.

3. **Place a Hex Tile**  
   To place a tile from your player board onto your Region board:
   - **Discard 2 Region Cards** matching the **color** of the tile you are placing.  
     - **Alternative Costs**:  
       - Use **3 cards of the same color** to replace **one** required card.  
       - Use **4 cards** (2 pairs of same color) to replace **both** required cards.  
   - **Use Workers**:  
     - 1 worker = 1 card (can replace one or both required cards).  
     - If using 2 workers, no cards are needed.  
     - Return used workers to supply.
   - Placement Rules:
     - Must be **adjacent** to an already placed tile (except first tile, which must be adjacent to starting castle).
     - Must be placed in a **zone of matching color** (e.g., orange village tile → orange zone).

#### Tile Effects (Triggered When Placed):
- **Castle (Dark Green)**:  
  Take any face-up neutral hex tile and **immediately place it** on your Region board (following all placement rules). Gain its **effect and scoring**.
- **City (Red)**:  
  Take **any square bonus tile** and place it next to your player board. If all 5 of a type are taken, choose another.
- **Agriculture (Light Green)**:  
  Gain **1 VP** on the green track **per new agriculture type** on the tile. Types: Olives, Grapes, Wheat, Livestock.  
  - A tile may show 1 or 2 types. Only **types not already present** in that zone count.
- **Inn (Blue)**:  
  Take **1 blue wooden hexagon** and place it in your storage.  
  - If no storage space: Gain **2 VP** on the red track instead.  
  - Later, you may place this hexagon as a **wild tile** on any colored space.  
    - Must discard **2 cards of the space’s color** (or use worker/card alternatives).  
    - Counts as that tile type for **scoring and effects** (e.g., as agriculture, it counts as a new type).
- **Quarry (Gray)**:  
  Take **1 marble token** and place it on your player board.
- **Village (Orange)**:  
  Take **1 worker token** and place it on your player board.
- **Monastery (Yellow)**:  
  Draw **3 Region Cards** (bonus tiles do **not** apply).
- **Wagon (Beige)**:  
  Draw **1 Yield Card**, gain its reward, then discard it.  
  - For each **+1 Yield Card** bonus tile, draw **1 extra card** and gain its reward.

#### Using Marble and Workers:
- **Marble**: Once per turn, return **1 marble** to the supply to take **any one action** again (e.g., draw cards, take a tile, place a tile). Can duplicate the same action.
- **Workers**: Used as card substitutes when placing tiles (see above).

#### Scoring (Immediate, During Turn):
After placing a tile:
- **Complete a Zone**: If all hexes in a **contiguous same-color zone** are filled:
  - 1 hex = **1 VP**  
  - 2 hexes = **3 VP**  
  - 3 hexes = **6 VP**  
  Awarded on the **green scoring track**.
- **Complete a Color**: If you are the **first** to fully cover **all spaces of one color** across your Region:
  - Gain **VP equal to the number** on the corresponding **color bonus tile**.
  - Then **flip the tile to its "2" side** (or remove it if already on "2").

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### After Each Round:
1. **Transfer Points**:  
   Add the value on your **green scoring track** to your **red scoring track**.  
   - Do **not reset** the green track.
2. **Update Marker**:  
   - If total on red track ≥ 50, place your marker on **50**.  
   - If ≥ 100, flip to **100** side.

#### Final Scoring (After Round 3):
All players gain **1 VP on the red track** for each:
- Unplaced **hex tile** (in stacks or storage)
- Unused **blue hexagon**
- Unused **marble token**
- Unused **worker token**
- Every **3 cards** in hand (round down)

#### Winning:
The player with the **most VP on the red scoring track** wins.

#### Tiebreakers (in order):
1. Most **empty spaces** on Region board (i.e., least developed).
2. Fewest **VP on green scoring track**.
3. Fewest **Region cards** in hand.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use marble to take an action before my turn?**  
  No. Marble can only be used **once per turn**, during your own turn.

- **Can I place a wild hexagon (blue token) on any space?**  
  Yes, but you must still discard **2 cards of the space’s color** (or use workers/alternatives) when placing it.

- **What happens if I can’t take a bonus from placing a tile?**  
  - If no storage space for a blue hexagon (from Inn): Gain **2 VP** on red track.  
  - If no bonus tiles available (e.g., all +1 Worker taken): Take any other available type.

- **Do agriculture types carry over between zones?**  
  No. Each **light green zone** is scored independently.

- **Can I use a worker and a card combo?**  
  Yes. Example: 1 worker + 1 matching card = valid for one required card.

- **What if the Yield deck is empty?**  
  Shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

- **Can I use marble to draw cards, then use marble again?**  
  No. Marble grants **only one additional action per turn**.
