## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
This is a simplified Warhammer wargame inspired by Warhammer Age of Sigmar (AOS) and Warhammer Underworlds (WHU), designed for accessibility and fast gameplay. The objective is to earn more Glory Points than your opponent by the end of the game, either through controlling objectives or achieving military victory by destroying enemy units.

There are two primary win conditions:  
- **Glory Points Victory**: Score points by controlling objective markers placed on the battlefield.  
- **Military Victory**: Eliminate the opposing army entirely.

The game supports solo play via an Automata system, where one player controls both sides or faces an AI-like opponent.

### 2. Components  
You will need:  
- **Figurines**: Representing units; can be Warhammer Underworlds fighters, other miniatures, or even LEGO/Playmobil figures.  
- **Dice**:  
  - 3 WHU dice sets (white = attack, black = defense, blue = spellcasting)  
  - 1 standard D6 (six-sided die)  
  - 1 D12 (twelve-sided die)  
- **Measuring Tools**:  
  - Flexible 12-inch (30 cm) tape measure (can be homemade and laminated)  
- **Glory Tokens / Objective Markers**:  
  - Customizable number of glory pawns and objective points placed on the board  
- **Optional Decorations**: Terrain elements (hills, bridges, trees, etc.) with tactical effects  
- **Automata Action Deck (for solo play)**: 12-card deck determining AI behavior (Aggression, Control, Position, Defense, Magic)

---

### 3. Setup  
**Board & Objectives**:  
- Roll off to determine who sets the board first.  
- Loser places their board edge first; winner chooses final board orientation.  
- Place objective markers (number and position decided by players; suggested: 26 objective pawns for 100 miniatures, 50 total Glory Points available).  
- Glory pawns respawn automatically on unoccupied objectives when no unit is present.

**Unit Placement**:  
- Roll off for fighter placement.  
- Player placing the last fighter gains +1 critical on their first roll-off.  
- Winner of initial roll-off chooses who goes first.

**Solo Play (Automata Rules)**:  
- Choose your warband and an Automata warband.  
- Separate Automata fighters and their cards.  
- Automata warband always activates first each round.  
- Construct a 12-card Action Deck from Aggression, Control, Position, Defense, and Magic cards based on desired AI behavior.  
- Place Automata fighters according to playstyle or board logic.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this sequence:

#### 1. **Spell Phase**  
- Magicians may attempt to cast one spell per turn.  
- Use blue WHU dice to cast. Successes on **Spiral** or **Critical (!)** symbols.  
- If only Criticals succeed, the caster suffers backlash and is destroyed.  
- Spells cannot be blocked except by an opposing wizard. In wizard duels, both roll defense dice and make armor saves.

#### 2. **Movement Phase**  
- Units move up to:  
  - Infantry: 8 inches  
  - Mounted (horses, wolves): 10 inches  
  - Special Units: 12 inches  
  - Flying Units: Any distance  
- Add 1D6 to movement for normal moves.  
- Units with fewer than 6 models can split movement if needed.  
- Climbing: Only archers, heroes, or champions can climb terrain up to 2 inches high via gradual slopes (no vertical walls).  
- Line of sight blocked by terrain >1 inch tall.

#### 3. **Shooting Phase**  
- Ranged attacks allowed against visible targets within range:  
  - Archers: 3 inches  
  - Crossbows: 4 inches  
  - Cannons/Large Projectiles: 10 inches (increased by elevation)  
- Height increases range; measure in straight line.  
- Only base models or heads of large creatures can shoot.

#### 4. **Charge Phase**  
- Charging unit adds **1D12 + 1D6** to base movement.  
- Must end base-to-base with enemy unit.  
- If charge fails, unit does not move. Choose another unit.

#### 5. **Combat Phase**  
- Triggered when units are base-to-base.  
- **Attack Dice**:  
  - Special Units (dragons, ogres, champions): 4 dice  
  - Elite Infantry/Cavalry: 2 dice  
  - Regular Infantry: 1 die  
- **Defense Dice**:  
  - Special Units: 2 dice  
  - Others: 1 die  
- Roll attack (white) vs. defense (black) dice.  
- Successes on **Axes** or **Critical (!)**.  
- **Critical-only resolution**:  
  - If attacker succeeds only on Crits → attacker loses 1 model  
  - If defender succeeds only on Crits → defender loses 1 model  
- **Injury Allocation**:  
  - 1 successful hit = 1 model removed  
  - Wounds allocated one at a time to engaged models  
  - Multiple attackers combine into single attack/defense roll if targeting same unit

#### 6. **Armor Save Phase**  
- After defense dice are rolled, perform armor saves:  
  - Roll D6 per defense die  
  - Must roll ≥ armor value to re-roll that defense die  
  - Armor Values:  
    - Knights/Elite Infantry: 2  
    - Infantry: 3  
    - Small Units (e.g., goblins): 4  
  - Special Units: may re-roll defense dice once automatically (no save roll required)

#### 7. **Automata Turn (Solo Play)**  
- At start of round, draw top card from Automata Action Deck  
- Execute primary action with bonus (e.g., +1 damage, +1 die)  
- If no unit can perform action, try next line on card  
- Prioritize actions:  
  - Combat: Attack enemy with least support, most friendly support, closest  
  - Movement: Move farthest unit that can reach objective  
- Inspire fighters at end of round: spend 1 Glory per 2 wounds (min 2 for 3–4 wound models)  
- Inspire leader first, then highest wounds, then adjacency priority

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Unit Composition  
- Standard unit: 2–6 models of same type  
- Special Units: Count as individual units (e.g., dragon, cannon, champion)  
- Lone models: If separated during combat, removed from play ("lost warrior")

#### Dice Resolution  
- **Axes**: Standard success  
- **Shields**: Cancel axes  
- **Critical (!)**: Counts as success, but triggers penalties if only source of success  
- **Spiral**: Spell success only  
- Only Crit cancels Crit  
- Shields cancel Axes

#### Special Units  
- 4 attack dice, 2 defense dice  
- May re-roll defense dice once  
- Can divide movement between 4 attacks to reposition or escape  
- Can join ongoing combat or act independently  
- Flying units can attack any ground unit  
- Cannons: 10" range, target any visible unit, +2 bonus if elevated

#### Terrain Rules  
- Elevation:  
  - +1" attack range for archers/crossbowmen per 1" height  
  - +2 range for cannons per 2" height  
- Blocks line of sight if >1" tall or in front of model  
- Climbing: Only certain units allowed; ascent must be gradual (≤1" step)  
- Scenery must allow enemy access—no unassailable perches

#### Spellcasting  
- Three spell types (based on blue dice used):  
  - 3 dice: Range 3", kills 2 models  
  - 2 dice: Range 4", kills 3 models  
  - 1 die: Range 6", kills 4 models  
- Measure in straight line; height doesn’t extend spell range  
- Only wizards can counter spells (duel system)

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Victory Conditions**:  
- **Glory Points**: Awarded at end of game for:  
  - Controlling objectives (player-defined value)  
  - Eliminating enemy units (optional: Automata gains Glory per wound dealt)  
- **Military Victory**: Destroy all enemy units  
- **Tiebreaker**: If both players have same Glory, military dominance decides

**End Phase (Per Round)**:  
- Score and discard objective cards  
- Upgrade fighters (if applicable)  
- Discard Power cards  
- Draw up to 3 Objective and 5 Power cards

**Solo Play – Automata Glory**:  
- Automata earns Glory based on:  
  - Wounds dealt  
  - Objectives held at end of round  
- Adjust scoring if too easy/hard (e.g., increase Glory per wound)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can a unit move through allies?**  
A: No. Units cannot pass over other models or bases (except flyers).

**Q: What happens if a spell fails?**  
A: No effect. If only Crits succeed, caster is destroyed.

**Q: Can two units attack the same enemy in one turn?**  
A: Yes. They combine attack dice into one roll; defending unit rolls defense once.

**Q: Can a lone model fight?**  
A: No. If a unit is reduced to one model and not adjacent to others, it is removed.

**Q: Do I have to charge if in range?**  
A: No, but you must engage if able—either move toward or fight.

**Q: Can I use terrain to block spells?**  
A: Yes. Terrain >1" tall breaks line of sight for spells and ranged attacks.

**Q: Can a special unit attack four times separately?**  
A: Yes. It can split its four attacks across different targets, repositioning between each.
