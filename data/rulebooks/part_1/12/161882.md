## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Irish Gauge is a strategic railway-building game set in Ireland where players invest in and expand railway companies to earn dividends and increase share value. The goal is to amass the most wealth by the end of the game through smart investment, track expansion, and efficient use of dividends.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Game Board (map of Ireland with hexes)  
- 16 Share Certificates (3–4 per railway, in 5 colors: yellow CBSC, purple WLW, orange BCD, blue GSW, red MGW)  
- 95 Locomotives (19 each in 5 colors)  
- 5 Railway Dividend Disks (1 per railway)  
- 30 Dividend Cubes (10 each of 3 colors: white, pink, black)  
- 1 Cloth Bag  
- 70 Currency Cards (denominations not specified)  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board in the center.  
2. Sort Share Certificates by color and stack them face-up beside their matching positions on the board, highest value at the bottom.  
3. Place matching locomotives next to each share stack.  
4. Place the 5 Railway Dividend Disks beside the Dividends Per Share box.  
5. Put 12 Dividend Cubes (4 of each color) into the bag.  
6. Randomly draw 1 cube and place it on each City on the board to assign initial Special Interests.  
7. Return remaining 18 cubes to the bag for gameplay.  
8. Place starting locomotives:  
   - Yellow CBSC in Cork  
   - Purple WLW in Limerick  
   - Orange BCD in Belfast  
   - Blue GSW in Dublin  
   - Red MGW in Dublin  
9. Give each player £20. Place remaining currency near the board.  
10. Randomly choose a starting player.

**Initial Auction Order:** CBSC → WLW → BCD → GSW → MGW  
- Starting player opens bidding; bidding proceeds clockwise.  
- Minimum bid = large printed value on the share.  
- Players may not reenter after passing.  
- If all pass, opening bidder gets the share for free.  
- Winner pays bid amount to the bank and becomes the opening bidder for the next share.  
- After all five initial shares are auctioned, the owner of CBSC takes the first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

#### Auction a Share  
- Choose the topmost available share from any railway.  
- You are the opening bidder; minimum bid = printed face value.  
- Bidding proceeds clockwise; players may not reenter after passing.  
- Winner pays bid to the bank and takes the share.  
- You do **not** need to own shares in the railway to auction it.

#### Place Railway Track  
- You must:  
  - Own at least one share in the railway.  
  - Have at least one unused locomotive for that railway.  
- You have 3 Build Points per turn (must use at least 1; unused points do not carry over).  
- New locomotives must connect via same-color track back to the railway’s starting city.  
- Only one locomotive per railway per hex.  

**Build Costs:**  
- Empty Easy (light green) hex: 1 BP  
- Empty Urban (blue-outlined) hex (Town or City): 1 BP  
- Empty Difficult (dark green) hex: 2 BP  
- Hex occupied by another railway (any type): +0.5 BP (rounded up if needed)  
- **Only one railway may occupy a Difficult hex.**

**Major City Dividend (immediate payout):**  
- When a railway connects **Belfast, Dublin, and Galway**, all shareholders split £12.  
- Divide £12 by number of shares held; round up. Pay each shareholder per share.

#### Place a Special Interest  
- Select a **Town** (urban hex without a cube) that is connected to a railway in which you own at least one share.  
- Look into the bag and choose **any** remaining Dividend cube.  
- Place it on the white square in the Town’s hex, converting it to a **City**.  
- If this is the **last cube drawn from the bag**, the game ends at the end of this turn.  
- Note: Players may inspect the bag contents at any time outside of Call for Dividends.

#### Call for Dividends  
- Draw 3 Dividend cubes blindly from the bag (or all remaining if fewer than 3).  
- Place them in the Drawn Dividends display row on the board (order doesn’t matter).  
- Each **color drawn** activates all Cities with that color’s Special Interest cube.  
- A color pays only once, even if multiple cubes of that color are drawn.  

**Payout Conditions (per railway):**  
A railway pays dividends **only if** it meets **one** of:  
- Connects to **at least one paying City** and **at least one Town**, OR  
- Connects to **two or more paying Cities**  

**Payout Calculation:**  
- Each connected **paying City** = £4  
- Each connected **Town** = £2  
- Total income ÷ number of shares sold (round up) = payout per share  
- Pay all shareholders accordingly  

Optional: Use the Dividend Track on the board to track income potential, but final payout depends on drawn cubes.

> **NO NULL ACTIONS:** If you cannot perform Auction, Place Track, or Place Special Interest, you **must** Call for Dividends.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Turn Order:** Clockwise; starts with CBSC shareholder after initial auction.  
- **Build Points:** 3 per turn, non-transferable, non-storable.  
- **Track Placement:** Must maintain connection to starting city.  
- **Special Interest Placement:** Non-random; player chooses cube and eligible Town.  
- **Dividend Drawing:** Blind draw of 3 cubes; drives scoring.  
- **Game End Trigger:** Last cube drawn during **Place a Special Interest** or **Call for Dividends**. Game ends at the end of that turn.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends immediately after the turn in which the **last Dividend cube is drawn from the bag**.  
- This can occur during:  
  - **Place a Special Interest** (if placing the last cube)  
  - **Call for Dividends** (if drawing the last cube)  
- At the end of that player’s turn, the game ends.  
- **Final Score = Cash in hand + Sum of face values (large numeral) of all owned Share Certificates**  
- Highest total wins. Ties are possible.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I auction a share of a railway I don’t own?** Yes. Ownership not required.  
- **Can two railways share a Town or Easy hex?** Yes, but only one per hex per railway.  
- **What if I can’t build 3 points worth?** Spend as many as you can (minimum 1 locomotive placed).  
- **Can I place a Special Interest in a Town not yet connected to my railway?** No. Must be connected.  
- **Do I have to use the Dividend Track?** No. It’s optional for tracking income potential.  
- **Tie in auction?** Highest bidder wins. If tied, winner is the player closest to auctioneer in turn order.  
- **What if no one wants to auction?** A player must eventually Call for Dividends (due to no-null-action rule).  
- **Can a railway earn Major City Dividend more than once?** No. Only once per game, when first connecting all three major cities.
