## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Tsuro is a game of paths and enlightenment, where players guide their markers along winding paths across a grid. The Dragon and the Phoenix are legendary guardians overseeing the balance of luck and destiny. The objective is to stay on the board by avoiding collisions and falling off the edge. The last player remaining wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board (with outer edge start marks)  
- 8 player markers (dragon, phoenix, or beads depending on edition)  
- 35 or 64 path tiles (depending on edition; standard is 35)  
- 1 Dragon tile (used for draw priority; not always used in first game)  

*Note: Some editions (e.g., Kosmos) include 64 tiles and a dual-sided board (Phoenix side for 2–4 players, Dragon side for 5–8).*

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Set the Dragon tile aside next to the board.  
3. Shuffle the path tiles and deal 3 face-down tiles to each player.  
4. Stack the remaining path tiles face down to form the draw pile(s).  
   - For Kosmos edition: use 2–3 stacks as draw piles.  
5. The oldest player is first (though designer suggests random choice).  
6. Clockwise from first player, each player:  
   - Chooses a marker.  
   - Places it on any start mark (white/dark brown mark on outer edge).  
   - May place adjacent to another player.  

*Note: In 2-player game, each player controls 2 markers.*

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has three phases, executed in order:  

**A) Play a Path Tile**  
- The active player selects one tile from their hand.  
- Places it in an open square directly adjacent to their marker.  
- Tile may be rotated into any of four orientations.  
- Once placed, tile remains fixed for the rest of the game.  

**B) Move Markers**  
- **Active player's marker:** Moves along the path on the newly placed tile, continuing until it reaches an open end.  
- **Other adjacent markers:** Any marker adjacent to the newly placed tile must also move along their path to its end.  
- **Elimination conditions:**  
  - If a marker reaches the edge of the board → eliminated.  
  - If two markers collide (paths connect) → both eliminated.  
- A player may not intentionally eliminate themselves unless no safe move exists.  

**C) Draw Path Tiles**  
- **Normal draw phase:**  
  - Starting with the active player, each player with fewer than 3 tiles draws one, proceeding clockwise.  
  - Drawing continues until all players have 3 tiles or the draw pile is empty.  
- **Dragon tile rules:**  
  - If the draw pile is empty and a player cannot draw, they take the Dragon tile.  
  - The player holding the Dragon tile draws first when new tiles become available (from eliminated players).  
  - When that player draws, they return the Dragon tile to the side.  
  - If an eliminated player had the Dragon tile, it is set aside and claimed by the next player unable to draw.  
- **Tile replenishment:**  
  - Tiles from eliminated players are shuffled into the draw pile.  
  - Optional Advanced Rule: Active player may exchange tiles with eliminated player(s) before their tiles are returned.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Path Continuity:** Each path tile has 4 paths connecting 8 edge points. Paths may cross but remain distinct.  
- **Grid System:** Tiles form a 6×6 grid. Each tile occupies one square.  
- **Movement:** Markers always move to the end of their current path after a tile is placed.  
- **Simultaneous Movement:** All affected markers move after tile placement, in no specific order (but active player moves first in case of tie).  
- **Hand Limit:** Players may never hold more than 3 path tiles.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Winning:**  
  - The last player with a marker on the board wins.  
- **Ties:**  
  - If all remaining players are eliminated on the same turn → tie.  
  - If all tiles are played and 2+ players remain → shared victory.  
- **No scoring system:** Game is won by survival.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I play a tile that causes my own elimination?**  
  A: Only if no other legal move exists. Self-elimination is not allowed otherwise.  

- **Q: What happens if the Dragon tile holder is eliminated?**  
  A: The Dragon tile is set aside. The next player who cannot draw (due to empty pile) takes it.  

- **Q: Can two players tie if one is eliminated after the other during the same turn?**  
  A: No — if multiple are eliminated simultaneously, it’s a tie. But if only one remains after movement, that player wins.  

- **Q: What if the draw pile is empty and no one has the Dragon tile?**  
  A: The first player during the draw phase who needs a tile but cannot get one takes the Dragon tile.  

- **Q: In 2-player game, how are turns structured?**  
  A: Each player controls two markers. On their turn, they play two full turns (tile, move, draw) — one for each marker, in any order.  

- **Q: Can a path loop endlessly?**  
  A: No — due to finite board and tile placement rules, endless loops are impossible without invalid play.  

- **Q: Do you draw a tile even if eliminated?**  
  A: No — eliminated players do not draw. Their tiles go into the draw pile.
