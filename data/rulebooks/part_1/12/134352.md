### 1. Lore & Objective
Two Rooms and a Boom is a social deduction, hidden roles game where players are split into two teams: the Red Team and the Blue Team. The Blue Team aims to protect the President, while the Red Team's Bomber attempts to be in the same room as the President when the bomb detonates. The game ends after three timed rounds of hostage exchanges. If the Bomber and President are in the same room at the end, the Red Team wins; otherwise, the Blue Team wins. A Gambler, included with an odd number of players, wins by correctly predicting which team won.

### 2. Components
- Rulebook
- 2 Leader cards (one for each room)
- Character cards:
  - President (Blue Team)
  - Bomber (Red Team)
  - Red Team cards (up to 8)
  - Blue Team cards (up to 8)
  - Gambler (Grey, neutral)
- Stopwatch (not included)

### 3. Setup
1. **Prepare the deck**: Include one President, one Bomber, and an equal number of Red and Blue Team cards (one per player). Add the Gambler if there is an odd number of players.
2. **Divide players**: Randomly split players into two rooms (or separate areas) with equal or nearly equal numbers.
3. **Deal cards**: Each player receives one facedown character card. Cards are secret but may be revealed during play.
4. **Start timer**: Begin the first round with a 3-minute timer.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- The game consists of **3 timed rounds**: 3 minutes, 2 minutes, and 1 minute.
- During each round:
  - Players remain in their rooms.
  - No communication between rooms is allowed.
  - Players may speak freely, reveal cards, or form alliances.
  - Each room elects or changes leaders as needed.
- At the end of each round:
  1. The leader selects hostages to exchange.
  2. Leaders meet in the neutral "parlay" area between rooms.
  3. Hostages are exchanged simultaneously.
  4. Timer is reset for the next round (except after the final round).

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Basic Rules
1. **Stay in your room**: Players cannot move between rooms during a round.
2. **No inter-room communication**: No yelling, signaling, or eavesdropping.
3. **No card trading**: Players cannot swap character cards.

#### Leaders
- The **first player nominated** in a room becomes leader and takes the leader card.
- **Abdication**: The current leader may hand the leader card to a willing player (who may accept or decline). No immediate reversal ("no givesy-backsies").
- **Usurping**: Any player can raise a hand and point to a new nominee. If **more than half** the room points to the same player, that player becomes the new leader.

#### Hostage Exchange
- At the end of each round, the leader selects hostages (cannot select themselves).
- Number of hostages depends on player count and round:
  - **6–10 players**: 1 hostage per round
  - **11–13 players**: 2, 2, 1
  - **14–17 players**: 3, 2, 1
  - **18–21 players**: 4, 3, 1
  - **22+ players**: 5, 4, 1
- **Process**:
  1. Leader announces selections to their room.
  2. Leader goes to the parlay point (between rooms).
  3. Once both leaders meet, the next round timer starts.
  4. Leaders call for hostages; they switch rooms.
  5. Leaders return to their rooms.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- After the final (1-minute) round, hostages are exchanged as usual.
- The bomb detonates: all players in the Bomber’s room gain the "dead" condition.
- **Red Team wins** if the President is in the same room as the Bomber.
- **Blue Team wins** if the President is not with the Bomber.
- **Gambler**: Before card reveals, must publicly guess which team won. Wins if correct, loses if wrong.
- All players then reveal their cards. A neutral meeting area may be used for the reveal, but players must remain in their final room groups to avoid confusion.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Color Revealing**: Not allowed in games with 10 or fewer players. Players must fully reveal or not reveal at all.
- **Tie or Dispute**: If unresolved, flip a coin or let the game owner decide.
- **Leader Unavailable**: If a leader leaves or is incapacitated, a new leader must be nominated immediately.
- **Advanced Play**: With experienced players, consider 5 rounds (5, 4, 3, 2, 1 minutes) and advanced character cards (not detailed in basic rules).
- **Burying a Card**: With an odd number of players, include the Gambler instead of burying. Burying is optional with even numbers but requires inclusion of President's Daughter and Martyr as backups.
