## Jump Drive — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players build space empires by playing Development and World cards. The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VPs) by strategically placing cards that provide VPs, income (card draw), and special abilities. The game ends when at least one player reaches 50 VPs. The player with the most VPs wins. In case of a tie, the tied player with the most cards in hand plus total income wins.

### 2. Components  
- 4 Survey Team Cards (gold-backed)  
- 112 Game Cards (Developments ◇ and Worlds ○)  
- 84 VP Chips (20×10, 12×5, 52×1)  
- 8 Explore Markers (double-sided: 〇 and *)  
- 4 Reference Cards  
- Rulebook and Solo Variant Materials  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place one Survey Team card face-up per player in the center of the table. Return extras to the box.  
2. Shuffle all 112 game cards. Deal 7 cards face-down to each player.  
3. Each player chooses 5 cards to keep, discards 2 face-down.  
4. Place VP chips and Explore markers nearby.  
5. Form a draw pile from remaining cards; place discard pile next to it.  

*First Game Variant:* Use preset hands A–D; skip shuffling and discarding.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds simultaneously in the following steps:

#### Step 1: Select Cards  
Players choose one of four actions, placing selected cards face-down:  
- Place 1 Development (◇)  
- Place 1 World (○ or ◎)  
- Place 1 Development and 1 World (◇ + ○)  
- Or: Draw and Place an Explore Marker  

*Survey Team Option:* Once per game, a player may take a face-up Survey Team card instead of playing a Development from hand. Pay its cost normally.

#### Step 2: Reveal and Pay  
Players reveal selected cards and resolve payment/conquest:

**Option a) Place 1 Development (◇)**  
- Pay cost in cards (discard from hand).  
- Cost reduced by 1 if no World is played (discount applies only to Development).  

**Option b) Place 1 World (○ or ◎)**  
- If black cost (e.g., ③): discard that many cards.  
- If red defense (e.g., ⑤): must have equal or greater Military icons (+1) in empire.  
- After placement, draw 1 card.  

**Option c) Place 1 Development and 1 World (◇ + ○)**  
- Pay full cost for both (no discount).  
- No card draw for placing a World.  
- Development must be played before World; its effects may apply to World placement.  

**Option d) Explore Action**  
If unable or unwilling to place cards:  
1. Place an Explore Marker (〇 side up).  
2. Draw 2 + number of Explore icons (〇) in empire (including 3 on marker).  
3. Discard number of cards equal to Explore icons in empire (net gain: 2 cards).  
4. Flip marker to * side.  

*Note:* Explore Marker’s icons count only for this action, not for future card powers.

#### Step 3: Score VPs  
All players score VPs for all cards in their empire:  
- Fixed VPs: as printed.  
- Conditional VPs: based on:  
  - Number of specific icons (e.g., Military, Chromosome, Explore)  
  - Presence of specific card types or colors  
  - Another player’s empire (choose one opponent)  
- Duplicates score separately.  
- "With" effects (e.g., "with a Rebel World") do not stack with multiple copies.  

Place VP chips under cards or marker to track per-round gains.

*Check Game End:* If any player has ≥50 VPs, proceed to final scoring.

#### Step 4: Collect Income  
Players draw cards equal to their Income (S) icons:  
- Order: Player with most VPs draws first.  
- Tie for most VPs: begin with player closest clockwise to original dealer.  
- Proceed clockwise.  

*Deck Management:*  
- If draw pile is exhausted, reshuffle discard pile into new draw pile.  
- After drawing, apply hand limit: discard down to 10 cards if over.  

Begin next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Anatomy  
- **Top Left:** Type and Cost/Defense  
  - *Type:* Novelty, Rare Elements, Genes, Alien Technology, or gray (no type)  
  - *Cost (black):* Cards to discard (Developments and non-Military Worlds)  
  - *Defense (red):* Military icons required to conquer Military Worlds (◎)  
- **Middle Left:** Icons (〇 Explore, +1 Military, × Chromosome)  
- **Bottom Bar:** VP value, Income (S), and special power  

#### Payment & Conquest Rules  
- Cannot use a card’s own icons to pay for itself (not yet in empire).  
- Cannot mix payment and conquest.  
- Cannot pay for Military Worlds unless using Contact Specialist.  
- Cannot conquer non-Military Worlds.  

#### Contact Specialist  
- Allows placing a Military World (◎) as if it were non-Military.  
- Pay cost in cards = Defense – 1.  
- Cannot be combined with Military Convoy.  

#### Second World Placement  
**Colony Convoy (non-Military World):**  
- Discard Colony Convoy to place a second non-Military World at –2 cost.  
- –2 applies only to second World.  
- Can be used in same or later round.  
- Can combine with Contact Specialist to place Military World via payment.  

**Military Convoy (Military World):**  
- Use unused Military strength after first conquest to place second Military World.  
- Cannot be used if first Military World was placed via Contact Specialist.  
- Second world placed after reveal/payment, before scoring.  

*Note:* If a player drew a card for not placing a Development, that card can be used as the second World.

#### Explore Marker  
- Use when not placing any cards.  
- Provides card draw and discard for refresh.  
- Flips to * after use; can be reused in future (no limit).  
- Its 3 Explore icons count only for that turn’s draw.  

#### Survey Team  
- Once per game, take from center instead of playing Development.  
- Counts as a Development; can benefit from discounts.  
- Pay cost normally (discard 1 card if used alone).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends immediately when any player reaches **50 or more VPs**.  
- Final scoring is continuous—no additional scoring phase.  
- **Winner:** Player with most VPs.  
- **Tiebreaker:**  
  1. Most cards in hand + total income (sum of S icons).  
  2. If still tied, players share victory.  

*Note:* No final scoring round; game ends after VP check in Step 3.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **What happens if I have no cards to pay cost?** You may still place a card if cost is reduced to 0 (e.g., via discount). Otherwise, you must Explore.  
- **Can I use a World’s Income the turn it’s placed?** No. Income is collected at end of round, after scoring.  
- **Do VP chips accumulate under cards?** Yes. Each round, sum all VPs from cards and collect total.
