## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the ancient Egyptian oasis of Faiyum, players take on the role of pharaoh’s advisors tasked with transforming a swampy, crocodile-infested basin into fertile farmland and a thriving economic center. Under the reign of Amenemhet III, you must harvest resources, build infrastructure, and earn the pharaoh’s respect through strategic development.

The objective is to gain the most reputation by efficiently using cards to harvest, build, trade, and develop the land. All structures and workers on the board are shared among players; only reputation, money, and resources are personal. The player with the highest reputation at the end of the game wins. In case of a tie, the player with more leftover money and resources wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order. On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

#### a) Play a Card from Your Hand  
- Place card face up on top of your personal discard stack.
- **Option 1: Use the full action** (must complete entire action; partial use not allowed).
- **Option 2: Gain $2** (if you cannot or do not want to use the action).

**Card Action Types**:
- **Harvest Actions**:
  - Place 1 worker upright on an undeveloped resource space (wheat, grape, stone).
  - Gain the resource shown.
  - Remove crocodile from wheat/grape spaces (gain $1 for each crocodile removed).
  - Stone spaces are crocodile-free.
  - After harvest, space remains undeveloped but cannot be harvested again until worker is removed.
- **Build Actions**:
  - Build on crocodile-free spaces (initially: red space, dam road spaces, building sites, stone spaces).
  - Build settlements, workshops, roads, bridges, or upgrade settlements to towns.
  - Place building blocks on monument sites (4 total sites, up to 15 blocks).
  - Roads and bridges:
    - Must start at a settlement, building site, or extend existing road/bridge.
    - May only branch at settlements or building sites.
    - Cannot create junctions on resource spaces.
  - First direct connection between two settlements, two building sites, or a settlement and building site earns **+1 reputation**.
    - Direct = no intervening settlements/building sites.
    - Only awarded once per pair.
- **Commerce Actions**:
  - Place 1 worker upright on a developed space (settlement, town, workshop, etc.).
  - Worker remains until removed via administration or card effect.
- **Other Actions**: As described on individual cards.

**Important Rules**:
- Structures and workers on the board are **common property** — any player may use them.
- Only reputation, money, and resources are personal.
- **Roses are wild**: Any basic resource (grape, stone, wheat) may be substituted with 1 rose when paying costs.
- You may replace **one** basic resource with $3 per action.
- Cannot use money or resources gained during an action to pay for that same action.
- Max **1 worker per space**.
- Developed spaces cannot be harvested.
- A space may have a settlement **or** a workshop, but not both.

#### b) Buy a Card from the Card Market  
- Only the **4 lowest-numbered cards** in the market (current market) are available for purchase.
- Pay the price shown below the card ($3, $4, $5, or $7).
- If the card has a discount token, reduce price by $1.
- After purchase:
  - Remove discount token and return it to the general supply (available for next administration).
  - Draw top card from draw pile and insert into market in correct numerical order.
  - Maintain ascending order across all 8 market slots.
  - Keep discount tokens on remaining cards when reordering.

#### c) Carry Out Administration  
Follow these three steps in order:

**I. Gain Income**  
- Gain $3 minus number of cards in hand (minimum $0).
- Remove up to 2 upright workers from any spaces; gain $1 per worker removed.
- Take top 3 cards from your discard stack into your hand (or all if fewer than 3).

**II. Buy Back More Cards**  
- Pay $1 to take each additional card from the top of your discard stack.
- May do this any number of times.
- Do not disturb order of remaining cards in discard stack.

**III. Replace Cards in Market**  
- **For 2–3 players**:
  - Remove 2 lowest cards from current market:
    - Prioritize cards with discount tokens.
    - If only one has discount, remove it + next lowest.
    - If none, remove two lowest.
  - Place discount tokens on all remaining cards in current market without them.
  - Draw 2 cards from draw pile, insert into full market in correct order (no discounts on new cards).
- **For 4–5 players**:
  - Remove 1 lowest card from current market (prioritize discounted; if none, remove lowest).
  - Place discount tokens on all remaining cards in current market without them.
  - Draw 1 card from draw pile, insert into market (no discount).

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Cycling**: Cards are played to a discard stack. Administration allows retrieval — top cards first. Order of play matters.
- **Card Market**:
  - 8-card market, sorted numerically.
  - Only 4 lowest available for purchase.
  - After purchase or administration, new cards refill market from draw pile.
  - Discount tokens rotate and are reused.
- **Shared Board**:
  - All structures and workers are common.
  - Players benefit from each other’s development.
- **Resource Substitution**:
  - 1 rose = any basic resource.
  - $3 = 1 basic resource (once per action).
- **Reputation**:
  - Gained via card actions, building first connections, removing crocodiles ($1 = 1 reputation), and claiming disaster cards at endgame.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger**:
- After the last card is drawn from the draw pile, players draw from the “final turns” stack.
- This stack contains 4 natural disaster cards (yellow-bordered, 122–128).
- When the **4th disaster card** is placed in the market (on the rightmost future slots), the endgame begins.

**Final Phase**:
- Administration action is **no longer allowed**.
- On your turn, you may:
  - Play a card
  - Buy a card (if available)
  - **Quit the game** by taking the highest-reputation disaster card still in the market.
- After quitting, you are out.
- When buying a card during final phase, draw a new card from the final turns stack and place it in the market (maintain order).
- The last player to quit gains **no reputation** (no disaster card available).

**Final Scoring**:
- Total reputation from:
  - Card actions
  - First connections (+1 per pair)
  - Crocodile removal ($1 = 1 rep)
  - Disaster cards claimed
- Highest reputation wins.
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with more total money and resources wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use only part of a card’s action?**  
  No. Actions must be completed fully or not at all.

- **Can I use money gained during an action to pay for it?**  
  No. All costs must be paid before the action begins.

- **Can two players use the same space?**  
  No. Only one worker per space. Once placed, it blocks others until removed.

- **Do I get reputation for every road built?**  
  Only for the **first direct connection** between two settlements/building sites. Subsequent connections or extensions don’t score.

- **Can I build on a space with a worker?**  
  Yes. Worker remains; space becomes developed.

- **Are roads across the lake possible?**  
  Yes, via bridges. The channel is crossed only by the initial dam road and bridges.

- **Can I substitute multiple resources with $3?**  
  No. Only **one** basic resource per action may be replaced with $3.

- **What happens if I run out of wooden pieces?**  
  Limited components may run out. If so, no more can be placed.

- **Can I use roses for $3 substitution?**  
  No. Roses replace resources, not money. $3 substitution is for resources only.

- **Solo Game Differences**:
  - No discount tokens.
  - Start with $4.
  - Administration:
    - Buy-back cost increases: $1, $2, $3, etc.
    - Replace any 2 cards in market (not just lowest).
  - Campaign mode: Complete 7 goals; unlock achievements in order.
