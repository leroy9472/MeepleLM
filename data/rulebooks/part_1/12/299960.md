## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the early Renaissance, players act as chancellors of emerging universities competing for academic prestige. The goal is to build the most prestigious institution by recruiting exceptional students and professors, advancing research, and managing resources effectively. Victory is determined by accumulating the most Prestige Points through various end-game scoring mechanisms.

2. Components  
- 1 double-sided game board (player count dependent)  
- 20 Research Cards (4 per letter A–D)  
- 48 Student Tiles (4 per faculty: Art, Law, Medicine, Mathematics)  
- 48 Professor Cards (4 per faculty)  
- 4 University Boards  
- 28 Bookshelves (7 per player color)  
- 100 Textbooks (25 per color)  
- 20 Dictionaries  
- 24 Masters (6 per color)  
- 6 Tutors  
- 24 Setup Cards  
- 10 Chancellor Cards  
- 12 Bust Cards  
- 9 Glory Tiles (3 per type)  
- 50 Ducats (coins: 30×1, 10×5, 10×10)  
- 12 Markers (3 per color)  
- Round Marker, Phase Marker  
- 16 Ignotus Cards (2-player mode only)  
- 9 Price Tiles (6× 2/4, 3× 3/3)

3. Setup  
1. Place the game board to match player count (2–4 players).  
2. Sort Research Cards by letter; randomly place one faceup per letter to form the Research Track.  
3. Sort Student Tiles by faculty. Place stacks of 2 (3 in 4-player) identical tiles on matching Campus spaces.  
4. Sort Professor Cards by faculty. Randomly select 2 different Professors per faculty; place stacks of 2 (3 in 4-player) on matching Academy spaces.  
5. Sort Glory Tiles by letter; randomly place one faceup per letter in the Hall of Fame.  
6. Place 1A, 1B, 1C Glory Tiles on corresponding Hall of Fame spaces.  
7. Place Round Marker on '1' of Round Track; Phase Marker on leftmost Phase Track space.  
8. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
   - 1 University Board  
   - 7 Bookshelves  
   - 6 Masters (4 on Archive, 2 in supply)  
   - 25 Textbooks (in supply)  
   - 3 Markers (1 on Prestige Track '0', 1 on Turn Order Track, 1 on Research Track 'Start')  
   - 4 random Setup Cards  
   - A, B, C Bust Cards (stacked on Hall of Fame)  
9. Draft Setup Cards: Each player keeps 1, passes 3 left; repeat until all have 4 cards, then each discards 1.  
10. Sum values on top of 3 kept Setup Cards. Lowest total becomes 1st player (tiebreaker: lowest card number). Assign Turn Order Track accordingly.  
11. Stack player Markers in Turn Order on Research Track 'Start' (1st on top).  
12. Shuffle Chancellor Cards. Reveal 2, place on B and C Bust Cards. Reveal additional (player count +1) faceup.  
13. In turn order, each player selects 1 faceup Chancellor Card for their play area. Remaining card goes on A Bust.  
14. In turn order, each player arranges 6 Bookshelves in Display (numbered side up), 7th Bookshelf to the right.  
15. Gain starting resources from Setup Cards (Textbooks, Research Steps, Prestige, Students, etc.). Discard Setup Cards.  

2-Player Specific Setup:  
16. Shuffle Ignotus Cards into a deck.  
17. Assign unused color to Ignotus: 1 University Board, 7 Bookshelves, 3 Masters, 1 Marker.  
18. Place Masters on Archive; Marker on Research Track 'Start'.  
19. Arrange Bookshelves: 1/1/1/1/2/2 ascending in Display; 3 Bookshelf to the right.  
20. Add Ignotus Textbooks to general supply.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 6 Rounds. Each Round has 3 Phases:  

2-Player Only:  
- Before Action Phase, reveal top Ignotus Card:  
  a) Advance Marker X Green Research Steps (auto-advance to Milestones, no bonus).  
  b) Add Y Textbooks to Display.  
  c) Place 1 Master on each specified Action space (no action performed).  

1) Action Phase  
In turn order, players choose one:  
- SEND MASTERS: Place 1+ Masters (or Tutors) from Archive to 1 Action space (Board or own Student). Perform Action.  
- GIVE A LECTURE: Choose a ready Professor. Pay textbook cost. Perform action. Exhaust Professor.  
- PASS: Exhaust all Professors. Move unused Masters to Dormitory. Cannot act further this Round.  

Action continues until all pass.  

2) Administrative Phase  
1. Turn Order: Player with most Masters on Bishop space becomes 1st (tie: first placed). Others ordered similarly. Those without remain in prior relative order.  
2. Book Storage Check: Storage limit = value above rightmost occupied 'A' Lecture Hall. Return excess Textbooks to supply.  
3. Book Reputation Track: Place 1 Textbook per player on track, ordered by Research Track position (topmost breaks ties).  
4. Ready all Professors.  
5. Move all Masters to Archive.  
6. Advance Round Marker. If at end, skip Income Phase and proceed to End Game.

3) Income Phase  
1. Display Clean-up: Gain 1 Ducat per Display Textbook. Slide Bookshelves left using 7th Bookshelf. Discard any Textbook on pushed-out shelf.

- **Display Cycling:** Always slide left. Removed Bookshelf becomes new 7th.  
- **Chancellor Abilities:** Not actions. Can be used any time during your turn.  
- **Ignotus Transactions:** When buying from Ignotus’s Display, pay supply (not Ignotus).  
- **Prestige Track:** Cannot go below 0.  
- **Multiple Uses:** Bishop and Colloquium can be used multiple times per Round.  
- **Passing:** Exhaust Professors and move Masters to Dormitory. Turn Order resets next Round via Bishop.
