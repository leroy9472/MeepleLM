### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **three races**. Each race follows this sequence:

#### A. Prepare Race  
- Draw one Horse Card per horse color and place it next to the matching betting area.  
- Place the corresponding horse on space 0 (or starting line).  
- Place Pace Chip on space #18.  

#### B. Betting Phase  
- **Race 1:** Randomly choose first player.  
- **Races 2 & 3:** Player with the most money bets first. Ties broken randomly.  
- Betting proceeds in clockwise order.  
- Each player places **one betting chip per round**, face-up (standard) or face-down (Hidden Bets variant).  
- Repeat for **three rounds**, so each player places **three bets**.  
- Restrictions:  
  - A player cannot place more than one bet on the same horse.  
  - Multiple players may bet on the same horse.  
- *Hidden Bets Variant:*  
  - Add a fourth betting round.  
  - Players use a 0-value chip; all bets are placed face-down and revealed after the race.  

#### C. Racing Phase  
1. Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise:  
   - Roll the D6.  
   - Choose any horse with a **face-up card** and move it forward the number of spaces shown on its card for the symbol rolled.  
   - Flip that horse’s card face-down — it cannot move again until all other horses have moved.  
2. Movement Rules:  
   - Only **one horse per space** (standard rule).  
   - If a horse’s destination is occupied, move it backward to the **first empty space behind** that point. It may not move at all if blocked.  
   - *Crowded Field Variant:* Multiple horses can occupy the same space. All start on space 0.  
3. After all horses have moved once (all cards face-down):  
   - Flip all horse cards face-up. Repeat the turn cycle.  
4. Ongoing Track Events:  
   - The **first horse to reach or pass space #18** receives the Pace Chip in its betting area.  
   - The **first horse to cross the finish line** is placed in Spot 1; second in Spot 2; third in Spot 3. Remove its card.  
   - The race ends immediately when the **third horse finishes**.  
   - The horse in **last place** is placed on Spot 7.  

#### D. Payouts  
1. **Main Payouts (Top 3 Horses):**  
   - Count total **bets** (not chips):  
     - A 1-chip = 1 bet  
     - A 2-chip = 2 bets  
   - Use the payout table on the board:  
     - Match the horse’s finishing position (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with the total number of bets placed on it.  
     - Each player receives the listed amount **per bet they placed** on that horse.  
     - Example: A player with a 2-chip (2 bets) on a horse that pays 350 for 2 bets → 350 × 2 = 700.  
   - *Alternative Payouts Variant:* Count number of **chips**, not bets. Each chip earns one payout regardless of value.  

2. **Pace Bonus:**  
   - Every player who bet on the horse with the Pace Chip receives **£100 per bet**.  
   - Paid even if the horse did not finish in top 3.  

3. **Last Place Penalty:**  
   - Every player who bet on the last-place horse pays **£100 per bet** to the bank.  
   - Players pay as much as they can if unable to cover full amount.  

4. **Third Race Multiplier:**  
   - All payouts (main, pace, penalty) are **doubled** in the third race.  

5. After payouts:  
   - Return all betting chips to players.  
   - Discard the 7 used Horse Cards.  
   - Reset for next race.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Betting Strategy:** Players distribute 3 bets across different horses, balancing risk and reward.  
- **Horse Movement:** Determined by die roll and horse card. Each horse has unique movement values for each die face.  
- **Turn Order in Racing:** Fixed clockwise; players must move a horse if possible.  
- **Blocking & Positioning:** Horses cannot share spaces (standard), leading to traffic jams, especially early in the race.  
- **Pace Chip:** Incentivizes betting on fast-starting horses, even if they don’t win.  
- **Penalty Risk:** Bets on slow horses can result in losses.  

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends after **payouts for the third race**.  
- The player with the **most money** wins.  
- In case of a tie, the tied player with the most bets placed wins (if specified), otherwise resolved per house rule.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can a horse move zero spaces?**  
A: Yes. If movement would place it in an occupied space and no prior empty space exists, it stays put.  

**Q: What happens if two horses tie for reaching space 18?**  
A: The first to reach or pass it during movement gets the Pace Chip. Turn order breaks ties.  

**Q: Can I bet on a horse that already has bets from others?**  
A: Yes. Multiple players can bet on the same horse.  

**Q: Do I get paid for both pace and placement?**  
A: Yes. If a horse wins pace and finishes in top 3, both payouts apply.  

**Q: What if I can’t pay the last-place penalty?**  
A: Pay as much as you can. Negative balances are allowed.  

**Q: Are 0-value chips used in standard game?**  
A: No. Only in Hidden Bets variant for bluffing. They do not count as bets.  

**Q: How are payouts calculated in third race?**  
A: All payout amounts (main, pace, penalty) are doubled.
