# RESIST!  
A Solitaire Game about the Spanish Maquis and their Battle Against Franco  

## 1. Lore & Objective

Spain, 1936. General Franco seizes power, sparking civil war and repression. After the Republic’s defeat, loyalists continue resistance as "maquis," hiding in the mountains to fight Franco’s regime using guerrilla tactics honed in WWII France. You lead this resistance, making dangerous choices to strike back and inspire hope.  

**Objective**:  
Earn victory points by defeating Missions. Win by choosing to end the resistance and totaling enough points from defeated Missions. Lose if you fail two Missions, lose five civilians, or draw a hand of only Spies.

## 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has 4 phases:  

### 1. PLAN  
A) **Play Maquis**:  
   - Play any number of Maquis from hand.  
   - Choose **Hidden** (less powerful, stays in deck cycle) or **Revealed** (stronger, discarded after round).  
   - Perform **PLAN** or **PLAN/ATTACK** actions if applicable.  
   - Resolve actions fully or not at all.  

B) **Choose Mission**:  
   - Select one Available Mission to attack.  
   - Flip any remaining face-down Enemies at that Mission face-up.  

### 2. ATTACK  
A) **DEFEND Effects Trigger**:  
   - Activate DEFEND effects on the chosen Mission and its Enemies.  

B) **Play Remaining Maquis**:  
   - Play all remaining Maquis from hand.  
   - Perform **ATTACK** or **PLAN/ATTACK** actions.  

C) **Defeat Targets**:  
   - Total **Attack Strength**:  
     - Use **Revealed Attack** value for Revealed Maquis.  
     - Use **Hidden Attack** value for Hidden Maquis.  
   - Use Attack Strength to defeat **Targets** (chosen Mission + its Enemies) one at a time.  
   - To defeat a Target, reduce Attack Strength by its **Defense value**.  
   - Defeated Enemies → Enemy Discard Pile.  
   - Defeated Mission → Defeated Missions Pile.  
   - Resolve **DEFEAT** effects immediately.  
   - Stop when no more Targets can be defeated. Excess Attack Strength is lost.  
   - Resolve **SURVIVE** effects on undefeated Enemies, then place them in Enemy Discard Pile.  

### 3. AFTERMATH  
A) **Check for Civilian Loss**:  
   - Some effects draw Civilian cards to Graveyard.  
   - If total civilians ≥ 5 → **Lose immediately**.  

B) **Mission Outcome**:  
   - **SUCCESS**: Defeated the Mission.  
     - Draw top card from Mission Deck → Available Missions.  
     - Draw Enemies from Enemy Deck equal to new Mission’s Garrison → place face-down beside it.  
     - If Enemy Deck empty, shuffle Enemy Discard Pile to form new deck.  
   - **FAILURE**: Did not defeat the Mission.  
     - Flip Mission face-down.  
     - Do **not** draw a new Mission.  
     - If this is the **second failed Mission** → **Lose immediately**.

     - **Continue**: Proceed to RECOVER.  
     - **End**: Proceed to Ending the Game.  
   - If no Available Missions remain, must end.  

### 4. RECOVER  
A) **Clean Up Played Maquis**:

   - Hidden Maquis + any Spies in hand → **Hidden Discard Pile**.  

B) **Draw New Hand**:

## 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Maquis Persona**:  
  - When played, choose **Hidden** or **Revealed**.  
  - Hidden Maquis go to Hidden Discard.  
  - Revealed Maquis go to Revealed Discard.  
  - Cards in hand/decks are neither Hidden nor Revealed until played.  

- **Actions**:  
  - Maquis have actions under **PLAN**, **ATTACK**, or **PLAN/ATTACK**.  
  - Action can only be used if played in matching phase.  
  - Must perform action **fully** or not at all.  

- **Effects Timing**:  
  - **DEFEND**: Triggers at start of ATTACK phase.  
  - **DEFEAT**: Triggers only when Target is **defeated** (not discarded).  
  - **SURVIVE**: Triggers if Target is **not defeated**.  
  - Multiple effects: Resolve in player’s chosen order.  

- **Card Management**:  
  - **Discard**:  
    - Maquis/Spy → Hidden Discard Pile  
    - Enemy → Enemy Discard Pile  
  - **Remove from Game**: Place in box. Not discarded.  

- **Getting Recruits**:  
  - Maquis from **Recruit Deck** can be brought in via:  
    - Defeating "Jailbreak at the Prison" Mission  
    - Defeating an Enemy **Jailor**  
    - Using Antonio or Ramona’s revealed actions  
    - Other specific effects  

- **Target Defeat**:  
  - You do **not** need to defeat all Enemies to win a Mission.  
  - Choose which Targets to prioritize.

## 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Winning**:  
- Choose to **end the resistance** during AFTERMATH.  
- Total **Victory Points** from Defeated Missions pile.  
- Use scoring table (implied in rules): higher points = better outcome.  

**Losing Conditions** (trigger immediate loss):  
1. Fail **two Missions**  
2. Lose **5 or more civilians** (Graveyard total ≥ 5)  
3. Draw a hand of **only Spies** during RECOVER  

If you lose, do **not** score points.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Out of Cards?**  
  - If deck empty when drawing, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
  - If still not enough, draw as many as possible.  

- **Discarding vs. Defeating**:  
  - Discarding an Enemy does **not** trigger DEFEAT effects.  
  - Only defeating triggers DEFEAT.  

- **Removing from Game**:  
  - Place card in box. Not in any discard pile.  

- **"In Play"**:  
  - Maquis are "in play" only after being played to the table.  
  - Not in play while in hand, deck, or discard.  

- **"Revealed/Hidden" Status**:  
  - Only applies to Maquis **in play**.  
  - Not defined in hand or decks.  

- **Must Play Drawn Cards?**  
  - Yes. Any Maquis drawn during a round **must be played**.  
  - Cannot save for next round.  

- **Can I Save Attack Strength?**  
  - No. Unused Attack Strength is lost at end of ATTACK phase.  

- **Multiple DEFEND/SURVIVE Effects**:  
  - Resolve in **player’s chosen order**.  

- **Enemy Garrison Limits?**  
  - No limit. Missions can have more Enemies than Garrison via effects.  

- **Timing Example**:  
  - Enemy Engineer (+1 Defense) triggers before Benigno’s (-1 Defense) because DEFEND effects resolve before ATTACK actions.  

- **Using Actions with Missing Requirements**:  
  - Cannot use an action unless you can perform it fully (e.g., can’t use Antonio’s hidden action without a Spy in hand).
