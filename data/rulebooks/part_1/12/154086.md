## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the role of Prospectors in the Wild West, managing resources, building settlements, and exploiting mining opportunities. The goal is to gain the most victory points by strategically building camps and settlements, influencing Boomtown offices, completing investments, shipping metals, and maximizing endgame scoring through terrain influence and contiguous building groups.

2. Components  
- Game Board (4 outer sections, 8 terrain tiles, 1 water tile)  
- 56 Mining Tokens (Copper, Silver, Gold, Forest)  
- 4 Player Boards  
- 48 Camp Pieces (12 per player, 10 per player in 4-player game)  
- 48 Influence Tokens (12 per player)  
- 12 Stagecoaches (3 per player)  
- 12 Miner Score Tokens (1 per player)  
- 20 Investment Cards  
- 5 Investment Bonus Tiles (1–5 points)  
- 12 Shipping Bonus Tiles (Copper: 4,7; Silver: 5,8; Gold: 6,9)  
- 4 Boomtown Office Tokens (selected from 12)  
- 1 4VP Token  
- Resource Cubes: Wood, Stone, Copper, Silver, Gold  

3. Setup  
1. Assemble the 4 outer board sections into a frame.  
2. Shuffle the 8 Terrain Tiles. Place the Water Tile in the center. Arrange the 8 Terrain Tiles around it so that 6 border the Water Tile and 1 is on each end.  
   - In 3- or 4-player games: All Terrain Tiles are face-up.  
   - In 2-player games: The two end tiles (not touching water) are placed face-down and unused.  
3. Shuffle the 56 Mining Tokens and place one on each matching-color terrain hex. Flip face-up only the 12 Mining Tokens adjacent to the Water Tile.  
4. Place Resource Cubes in supply.  
5. Each player selects a color and takes:  
   a. 1 Player Board  
   b. 1 Miner Score Token → place on 0 of main score track  
   c. Camp Pieces: 12 each in 2/3P; 10 each in 4P  
   d. 12 Influence Tokens  
   e. 3 Stagecoaches → place on starting space of each shipping track  
6. Shuffle 12 Office Tokens, randomly select 4, and place them in the Boomtown grid (bottom-left) in any arrangement to fit in a 3×3 grid. Fill the remaining space with the 4VP Token.  
7. Shuffle 20 Investment Cards, display 8 face-up near the board; return the rest to the box.  
8. Place Investment Bonus Tiles:  
   - 2P: Use 1, 2, 3-point tiles  
   - 3P: Use 1, 2, 3, 4-point tiles  
   - 4P: Use all 5 tiles (1–5 points)  
9. Place Shipping Bonus Tiles:  
   - For each metal (Copper, Silver, Gold), place the lower-value tile on the first bonus space and the higher-value tile on top of the second bonus space.  
10. Randomly determine Starting Player. Distribute Player Order Tokens clockwise. Non-playing positions are returned to the box.  
11. Each player takes starting resources as shown on their Player Order Token and places them in the indicated bins of their Supply Track.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order. Each turn consists of three steps in order:  
1. Activate Your Supply Track  
2. Use Metals  
3. Build or Loot  
After all players have placed all their Camp Pieces, each player takes one final turn (only Steps 1 and 2). Then proceed to Final Scoring.

5. Core Mechanics  
**Step 1: Activate Your Supply Track**  
- Choose one non-empty bin on your Supply Track.  
- Move all resources upward as far as possible, leaving exactly one resource in each bin passed.  
- Resources reaching the top (Usage Area) can be used this turn.  
- If no resources reach the Usage Area, you proceed to Loot.  
- Unused resources in the Usage Area are discarded at the end of your turn.

**Step 2: Use Metals**  
Use any metals (Copper, Silver, Gold) in your Usage Area in any order, with the following limits:  
- **Investments (max 1 per turn):**  
  - Pay required metals to the bank.  
  - Take the Investment Card and place it in front of you.  
  - Score immediate points shown on card.  
  - Resolve any special ability immediately.  
  - Take the highest remaining Investment Bonus Tile and score its points.  
- **Boomtown (max 1 per turn):**  
  - Pay the metal from the row above and the column to the right of the desired office.  
  - Place one Influence Token on an unoccupied space in that office.  
  - Each office has two spaces; both can be occupied (by same or different players).  
  - If placing on the 4VP Token, score 4 points immediately.  
- **Shipping (unlimited per turn):**  
  - Return any number of metals to the bank.  
  - Move your Stagecoach forward 1 space per metal shipped.  
  - Skip over Shipping Bonus Tile spaces: take the topmost tile and score its points immediately.  
  - Score 2 points when passing the 2-point threshold; 3 points when passing the 3-point threshold on each track.

**Step 3: Build or Loot**  
Must choose one:  
- **Build a Camp:**  
  - Pay 1 Wood or 1 Stone.  
  - Choose a revealed Mining Token. Replace it with a Camp.  
  - Take all resources from the token and place them in one bin of your Supply Track.  
  - Gain 1 influence in that terrain: place the Mining Token face-down on the leftmost available space of the corresponding Influence Track.  
- **Build a Settlement:**  
  - Pay 1 Wood and 1 Stone.  
  - Replace a revealed Mining Token with a Camp + Influence Token underneath.  
  - Take resources and place in one bin of Supply Track.  
  - Gain 2 influence: place the Mining Token on the Influence Track, skipping one space.  
- **Loot:**  
  - If you cannot or choose not to build.  
  - Place one Camp in the Wanted area and lose 1 point immediately.  
  - Choose a revealed Mining Token, take its resources (place in one bin of Supply Track).  
  - Remove the Mining Token from the game.  
  - No influence gained. Hex remains empty.

**Completing the Build Action (after Build or Loot):**  
- Immediately reveal the resource side of all Mining Tokens adjacent to the chosen hex.  
- Place all acquired resources into one bin of your Supply Track.  
  - Bin 1: 0 points  
  - Bin 2: 1 point  
  - Bin 3: 2 points  
  - Bin 4: 3 points  
- Score points immediately. Resources can be placed in a bin that already contains resources.

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End:**  
- When the last Camp is placed, each player takes one final turn.  
- Final turn: Only Steps 1 and 2 (Activate Supply Track, Use Metals). No Build or Loot. No new resources are acquired.

**Final Scoring:**  
1. **Building Groups:** Score 2 points per building in your largest contiguous group (Camps and Settlements count).  
2. **Boomtown:** Score endgame bonus points for each Office you influenced (as printed on the Office Token). If you occupy both spaces in an office, score the bonus twice.  
3. **Looting Penalties:**  
   - Most Wanted: Player with most Camps in Wanted area loses 1 point per Camp.  
   - Second Most Wanted: Next highest loses 1 point per 2 Camps (rounded down).  
   - Tie for Most Wanted: All tied players receive Most Wanted penalty; Second Most Wanted penalty is ignored.  
   - Tie for Second Most Wanted: All tied players receive the penalty.  
4. **Terrain Bonuses:** For each terrain type, award:  
   - 1st place: Points as printed (Copper: 12/8, Silver: 10/6, Gold: 8/4, Forest: 6/2)  
   - 2nd place: Points as printed  
   - Tie: Winner is player with more Settlements in that terrain.  
   - If still tied for 1st: Add 1st and 2nd place points and divide (rounded down).  
   - If still tied for 2nd: Split 2nd place points (rounded down).  
   - In 2-player games: No 1st place bonus. Player with most influence gets 2nd place points. Other player gets nothing.

**Winning:**  
- Highest total score wins.  
- Tiebreaker:  
  1. Fewest Camps in Wanted area.  
  2. Most resources remaining in Supply Track.  
  3. If still tied, rematch.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I choose an empty bin to activate?** No. You must activate a bin with at least one resource.  
- **Can I save resources between turns?** No. Unused resources in the Usage Area are discarded at the end of each turn.  
- **Can I build anywhere?** Yes. No adjacency requirement, though contiguous groups score better.  
- **Can I influence the same Boomtown office twice?** Yes, if both spaces are available. You may occupy both and score the bonus twice.  
- **Do I place a Camp every turn?** Yes — as a Camp, Settlement, or in the Wanted area.  
- **What happens to the Mining Token after Loot?** It is removed from the game.  
- **Can I ship metals even if I don’t complete a full shipment?** Yes — each metal shipped moves your Stagecoach one space and may trigger thresholds or bonus tiles.  
- **Are Influence Tokens limited?** No — if you run out, use substitutes.
