## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Fellowship of the Ring must journey from Bag End to Mount Doom in Mordor to destroy the One Ring before Sauron captures the Ring-bearer. Players cooperate to advance through scenarios, manage corruption, and survive events. The game is won if the Ring is successfully destroyed at Mount Doom. It is lost if the Ring-bearer is captured by Sauron or the final event in Mordor occurs.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
#### Master Board  
- Move marker to next location.  
- If location has text (e.g., Bag End, Rivendell), resolve all actions in order.  
- If location is a scenario (Moria, etc.), set up the Scenario Board and begin play.  

#### Scenario Board  
Each player takes a turn in clockwise order, starting with the Ring-bearer:  
1. **Reveal Event Tile(s)**  
   - Reveal tiles until an Activity symbol (Fighting, Hiding, Traveling, Friendship) is revealed.  
   - For non-Activity tiles:  
     - **Sundial**: Advance Event marker; resolve next event.  
     - **Sundial + 3 items**: Group must discard 3 cards, or 1 card + 1 token + 1 shield, or next event occurs.  
     - **Eye/2 spots**: One player moves 2 spaces toward darkness, or Sauron moves 1 space.  
     - **Ring spot**: Ring-bearer moves 1 space toward darkness.  
     - **Eye/black square**: One player activates Sauron, or Sauron moves 1 space.  
     - **Black spot**: Active player moves 1 space toward darkness.  
     - **Rectangle**: Active player discards 1 card.  
   - Repeat until an Activity tile is revealed.  
2. **Take One Action**  
   - **Play 1 or 2 cards**: One white and one grey (except Pippin, who may play two of same color).  
   - **Draw 2 Hobbit Cards**  
   - **Move backward 1 space** on Corruption track.  
3. **Discard unwanted cards** (optional).  
4. **Cleanup**: Discard used cards and revealed Event Tiles.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Using the Ring  
- Once per scenario, the Ring-bearer may put on the Ring:  
  1. Place Ring over their Hobbit.  
  2. Roll Threat Die; resolve consequences.  
  3. Advance any Activity marker by (4 – number of symbols on die).  
- Spaces passed or landed on are ignored.  
- May be used before Step 1b, 2a, 2b, or 3 of a turn.  

#### Calling Gandalf  
- Any player may discard 5 Shields to use a Gandalf Card.  
- Active player chooses which card to use:  
  - **Foresight**: Look at top 3 Event Tiles; reorder them.  
  - **Guidance**: Use as double Joker to pay cost or move marker 2 spaces.  
  - **Healing**: Move one Hobbit back 2 spaces on Corruption track.  
  - **Magic**: Ignore next event (cannot prevent final Mordor event).  
  - **Persistence**: One player draws 4 Hobbit Cards.  

#### Yellow Feature Cards (playable anytime)  
- **Athelas**: Prevents penalty for missing Life Tokens.  
- **Belt**: Avoid one die roll.  
- **Elessar**: Move one Hobbit back 1 space.  
- **Lembas**: Draw cards to refill hand to 6.  
- **Miruvor**: Pass one card to another player.  
- **Mithril**: Ignore one die roll result.  
- **Phial**: Skip revealing Event Tiles this turn.  
- **Staff**: Ignore Sundial + 3 items tile.  

#### Character Abilities  
- **Frodo**: Use any white Hobbit card as a Joker.  
- **Sam**: Reduce die roll movement by 1 (max 1 space saved).  
- **Pippin**: May play two cards of same color.  
- **Merry**: Needs only two types of Life Tokens at scenario end.  
- **Fatty**: Draws 2 extra cards at end of each scenario.  

#### End of Scenario  
Occurs when:  
- Main Activity Line reaches end, OR  
- Last Event Tile is resolved.  

Then:  
1. **Life Tokens Check**: Each player must have 1 Heart, 1 Sun, 1 Ring token. For each missing type, move Hobbit 1 space toward Sauron (Merry moves 1 less).  
2. **New Ring-bearer**: Player with most Ring tokens becomes Ring-bearer. Tie: closest clockwise from current. If none have Ring tokens, player to left becomes Ring-bearer.  
3. **Draw Cards**: New Ring-bearer and Fatty (if in play) draw 2 Hobbit Cards.  
4. **Return Tokens**: All Heart, Sun, Ring tokens returned to pool.  
5. **Advance Master Board**: Move marker to next location. If scenario, Ring-bearer starts.  

#### Elimination  
- A player is eliminated if their Hobbit reaches or passes Sauron on Corruption track.  
- Also eliminated if unable to discard required cards or shields.  
- Discard all cards and tokens; keep Shields for scoring.  
- Game continues unless Ring-bearer is eliminated.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends when:  
1. **Ring Destroyed**: Fellowship wins.  
2. **Ring-bearer eliminated**: Fellowship loses.  
3. **Final Mordor Event occurs**: Fellowship loses.  

#### Scoring  
- **If Ring is destroyed**: All players score 60 + total Shields collected (including eliminated players).  
- **If Ring not destroyed** (Ring-bearer caught or final Mordor event): All players score value of current space on main Activity Line. Shields not counted.  
- **Competitive variant**: If Ring destroyed, each player scores 60 + their own Shields. If Ring-bearer caught with ≥3 Ring tokens, only that player scores main track value; others score 0.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you play multiple Yellow Cards in one turn?** Yes, anytime.  
- **Can Gandalf be called during another player’s turn?** Yes.  
- **Can Belt prevent die roll when using the Ring?** No.  
- **Can Mithril reduce spaces moved with Ring?** No — only prevents die consequences.  
- **If scenario ends mid-turn, do remaining die rolls occur?** Only if triggered before elimination.  
- **Can players discuss card holdings?** Yes, but cannot show cards or exchange them unless a card allows it.
