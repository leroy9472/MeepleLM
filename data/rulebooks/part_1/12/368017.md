   - Place pile in center of play area.

   - Reveal a number based on players:  
     - 2P: 10 tokens

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, follow these steps in order:

1. **[Optional] Flip Action**  
   - If any row or column in the Market contains only Resource Cards, you may flip **one** of them to its Building side (free action).  
   - Cannot flip Building Cards back to Resource side.

2. **Draft Two Cards**  
   Choose **one** of the following:
   - **Option A**: Take the top two cards from the Draw Pile. These are **Resource Cards only** and cannot be used as Buildings.  
   - **Option B**: Take **two orthogonally adjacent cards** (up/down/left/right) from the Market.  
     - If the card is a **Building**, you **must construct it immediately**.  
     - If the card is a **Resource**, you may **save it in hand** or use it to pay now.

3. **Pay Construction Costs (if applicable)**  
   - For each Building drafted, pay its cost (shown at bottom of card) using:
     - Discard Resource Cards from hand, or  
     - Use permanent resource points from previously constructed Buildings (top-right icon).  
   - Each permanent resource can be used **only once per turn**.  
   - **Ingenuity Resources** act as wilds (replace any resource type).  
   - If you cannot pay for **all** drafted Buildings, you cannot take them.

4. **Place Constructed Buildings**  
   - Place successfully paid-for Building Cards face up in your City tableau.  
   - Permanent resources are now available for future turns.

5. **Claim Civic Token (if applicable)**  
   - If you constructed a **Civic Building** (has civic icon: ), take **one** Civic Token from the supply.  
   - Tokens remain visible and are scored at game end.

6. **Refill Market (if Market cards were taken)**  
   - Refill **only if you drafted from the Market**.  
   - Replace each empty space with a card from the Draw Pile, one at a time, in reading order (top-left to bottom-right).  
   - **Flip rule**:  
     - If a **Resource Card** was taken → place new card **face up as a Building** (flip to Building side).  
     - If a **Building Card** was taken → place new card **face up as a Resource** (Resource side up).  
   - If you drew from the Draw Pile, **skip refill**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Permanent Resources**: Generated by constructed Buildings (top-right icon). Can be used to pay for future buildings. One use per resource per turn.  
- **Resource Cards**: Collected and discarded to pay costs. Cards with two symbols = 2 of that resource.  
- **Ingenuity**: Acts as a wild resource (can substitute for any type).  
- **Civic Buildings**: Do not provide permanent resources or direct points. Grant access to Civic Tokens.  
- **Market Dynamics**: Composition shifts based on what players take. Strategic flipping and refill rules create evolving opportunities.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End**:  
- The game ends when the Draw Pile is depleted and a refill is required but impossible.  
- Each player takes **exactly 17 turns**.  
- Final Market will have 14 cards.

**Scoring**:  
Players score:
- **Points on constructed Building Cards** (printed value)  
- **Civic Tokens** (each has unique scoring condition):  
  - **Civic Token 1**: 2 points per **economy** permanent resource  
  - **Civic Token 2**: 3 points per **set** of energy + community permanent resources (e.g., 2 energy + 2 community = 6 pts)  
  - **Civic Token 3**: 3 points per permanent resource type with **3 or more** (e.g., 3+ economy = 3 pts, 3+ ecology = 3 pts)  
  - **Civic Token 4**: 2 points per **unspent Ingenuity Resource Card** in hand

**Final Score Example**:  
- Buildings: 24 pts  
- Civic Token 1: 8 pts  
- Civic Token 2: 6 pts  
- Civic Token 3: 6 pts  
- Civic Token 4: 4 pts  
- **Total**: 48 pts

**Tiebreaker**:  
- Most unspent Resource Cards.  
- If still tied, players **share the victory**.
