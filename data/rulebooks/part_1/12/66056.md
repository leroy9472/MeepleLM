## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Rivals for Catan is a two-player (or two-team) strategy game set in the Catan universe, where players build principalities, expand settlements, and compete for victory points through economic, military, and cultural dominance. The goal is to be the first to reach the required number of victory points:  
- **12 victory points** in most games  
- **13 victory points** in *The Era of Barbarians*  

Victory is checked at the end of a player’s turn.

### 2. Components  
Each player needs:  
- 1 player board (principality)  
- 1 scoring card with tracks for Victory, Strength, Commerce, Skill, and Progress  
- Wooden tokens for tracking points on scoring tracks  
- 3 explorer ships (for *The Era of Explorers*)  
- 1 Explorer Harbor (card)  
- 10 sea cards (islands, pirates, shipwrecks) arranged in a 3×3 grid  
- 7 cubes or markers for card play tracking  

Shared components:  
- Basic and Theme card decks  
- Event card deck (varies by theme game)  
- 2 dice: Production die (1–6) and Event die (symbols)  
- Special marker cards (e.g., Triumph, Manifesto of Humane Conduct)  
- Public Feeling card (in *The Era of Prosperity*)  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player receives a scoring card and places wooden tokens on the starting positions (red spaces) of each track.  
   - Each player takes a Basic stack of cards and draws 3 cards as their starting hand. Card order must not be changed.  
   - Place 1 Public Feeling card near the board in *The Era of Prosperity*.  

2. **Theme-Specific Setup**:  
   - **The Era of Explorers**:  
     - Place the Explorer Harbor face-up next to one of your starting settlements.  
     - Shuffle the 9 remaining sea cards and place them face-down in a 3×3 grid beside the harbor.  
     - Place 3 explorer ships on the harbor: 1 active (ship side up), 2 inactive (blank side up).  

   - **The Era of Barbarians**:  
     - Win condition: 13 victory points.  
     - Event deck setup:  
       - Set aside 3 *Barbarian Attack* cards and the *Yule* card.  
       - Shuffle remaining Basic Set event cards with *Retreat of the Barbarians*, place 3 face down.  
       - Place *Yule* on top.  
       - Shuffle the 3 *Barbarian Attack* cards with the other 6 event cards and place them on top of *Yule*.  
     - The *Triumph* marker card has no building cost. When you build your first city, take it and place it adjacent to any region. It can be moved at any time.  

   - **The Era of Prosperity**:  
     - Introduces **contentment points ("stars")**, tracked like resources on regions.  
     - Stars are used to activate Public Feeling effects and pay for certain buildings.  
     - Once per turn, you may pay 2 stars to gain 1 resource of your choice.  
     - Stars are not resources: they cannot be traded or lost in Brigand Attacks.  

   - **The Era of Sagas**:  
     - Introduces **wisdom points ("owls")**.  
     - Place sage cards (region expansions) to earn owls: when the adjacent region’s number is rolled, the sage gains 1 owl.  
     - Owls are used to activate certain expansion or action cards (e.g., *Grove of Peace* costs 1 owl).  
     - Event deck setup:  
       - Set aside 2 *Insurrection* cards and *Yule*.  
       - Shuffle other Basic Set cards with *Taxation*, place 3 face down.  
       - Place *Yule* on top.  
       - Shuffle 2 *Insurrection* cards with remaining 7 event cards and place on top.  
     - The *Manifesto of Humane Conduct* marker card is free. Take it when building your first city and place it adjacent to any region. It can be moved at any time.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players alternate turns. Each turn follows this sequence:  

1. **Roll Dice**  
   - Roll the **Production die** (1–6) and **Event die** (symbol).  

2. **Brigand Attack Check**  
   - If the Event die shows **Brigand Attack**:  
     - Any player with **more than 7 unprotected resources** loses all wool and gold.  
     - Resources on region cards are protected; hand-held resources are not.  

3. **Gain Resources**  
   - Each player rotates **region cards** matching the Production die number to show +1 resource.  
   - Maximum of **3 resources per region card**.  

4. **Resolve Event Die**  
   - **Trade (Scale)**: If you control the **scale token**, take 1 resource of your choice from your opponent.  
   - **Celebration (Harp)**: If you have the most **skill points**, gain 1 resource of your choice. Otherwise, both players gain 1 resource.  
   - **Plentiful Harvest**: Each player gains 1 resource of their choice.  
   - **Event Card**: Draw and resolve the top event card. All players follow instructions.  
     - If *Yule* is drawn, reassemble the event deck as per theme rules.  
     - If *Barbarian Attack* or *Insurrection* is drawn, resolve it, then place it under the top 4 cards (not bottom).  

5. **Action Phase (Build, Trade, Play Cards)**  
   - Perform actions in any order:  
     - **Build**: Pay resources (rotate region cards) to play cards from hand or available face-up theme cards.  
       - One copy max of cards marked (1x).  
       - Must meet prerequisites.  
       - Units/buildings placed above/below region cards.  
     - **Trade**: Trade 3 of one resource for 1 of another. Some cards improve ratio (e.g., 2:1).  
     - **Play Action Cards**: Play any number. Some require prerequisites.  
     - **Discard Option**: You may discard **1 building or unit** you previously built.  
   - After building, **advance on scoring tracks** if the card has:  
     - **Victory point symbol**: Move victory token.  
     - **Strength symbol**: Move strength token. First to 3+ and more than opponent gains **axe token** (+1 VP).  
     - **Commerce symbol**: Move commerce token. First to 3+ and more than opponent gains **scale token** (+1 VP).  
     - **Skill symbol**: Move skill token. Most skill points triggers resource gain on Celebration.  
     - **Progress symbol**: Increases hand limit by 1 (default is 3).  

6. **Replenish Hand**  
   - Draw from **Basic** or **Theme** deck until hand size = 3 + progress points.  
   - Or pay **2 resources** to select a card from the top 3 of a deck.  
   - If over hand limit, discard excess to **bottom** of respective deck. Do not mix decks.  

7. **Optional Card Exchange**  
   - Return 1 card from hand to bottom of any draw deck.  
   - Then:  
     - Draw 1 card from top of same deck, **or**  
     - Pay 2 resources to choose 1 card from same deck.  
   - Do not change deck order.  

8. **End of Turn Check**  
   - If you have **12 VP** (or **13 in The Era of Barbarians**), you win immediately.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Explorer Ships (*The Era of Explorers*)  
- **Build**: Pay 1 lumber + 1 wool. Turn ship to active side. Max 3 ships.  
- **Use**: Up to 3 actions per turn (1 per ship). Can be used on turn built.  
- **Range**: Determined by **sail points** from buildings (e.g., Sailmakers' Shop = 1).  
  - Each point = 1 movement in horizontal/vertical direction from Explorer Harbor.  
- **Actions**:  
  - **Discovery**: Turn over a face-down sea card. Place explorer ship on it. Follow "Discovery" text. Ship returns to harbor after turn.  
  - **Mission**: Visit a discovered (face-up) sea card. Follow "Mission" text. If successful, rotate card 90°. Max 1 action per sea card per turn.  
- **Fighting Pirates**:  
  - Total your **cannon points** from buildings.  
  - Roll Production die, add cannon points.  
  - If sum > pirate strength: win reward.  
  - If sum < pirate strength: **lose explorer ship** (turn to blank side).  
  - Tie: re-roll.  
- **Lost Ships**: Return to harbor at end of turn. Can be rebuilt later.  
- **Mission Limits**:  
  - Only one player can reach **level 3** (3rd rotation) on a given sea card type.  
  - Opponent may still perform missions but cannot reach level 3.  

#### Special Symbols  
- **Cannon Points**: Required to fight pirates.  
- **Sail Points**: Determine explorer ship movement.  
- **Wildcard Resource**: In *The Era of Explorers*, this symbol = 1 resource of your choice.  
- **Wisdom Points (Owls)**: Earned via sages. Used for card effects. Not tradable.  
- **Contentment Points (Stars)**: Earned via buildings. Used for Public Feeling effects and construction. Not tradable.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory Points**: From building cards, tokens (axe, scale), and mission completions.  
- **Axe Token**: Awarded if you have ≥3 strength points and more than opponent. Worth 1 VP.  
- **Scale Token**: Same, for commerce. Also grants resource theft on Trade rolls.  
- **Win Condition**:  
  - **12 VP** in most games.  
  - **13 VP** in *The Era of Barbarians*.  
- Victory is checked **after** all turn actions and hand replenishment.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
