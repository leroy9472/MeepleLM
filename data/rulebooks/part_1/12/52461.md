Each round consists of:  
1. **Beginning of Round**

2. **Action Phase**  
   - Starting player places a pawn (Player or Additional Action) on any unoccupied action space.  
   - Actions on Player boards can be taken multiple times (multiple pawns allowed).  
   - Main board actions can only be taken once per round (one pawn per space).  
   - Play proceeds clockwise until all pawns are placed or players pass.  
3. **Income & Cleanup Phase**  
   - Gain Gold equal to current Income (except in Round 9).  
   - Retrieve all pawns.  
   - Return all Additional Action pawns to supply.  
4. **Generation End (after last round of each Gen)**  
   - Gain Honor equal to current Prestige.  
   - Gain 1 Honor per child born this Generation.  
   - Return all Additional Action pawns to supply.  
   - If no children born, player is eliminated.  

**Generation Start (Gen II & III only)**

- Discard old Complication cards.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Family Tree**: Built vertically—Gen I (Head of Family), Gen II (children), Gen III (grandchildren), Gen IV (great-grandchildren, for scoring only).  
- **Marriage & Children**:  
  - **Marry**: Use Friend card to marry a current-gen family member. Pay cost/receive dowry, adjust Income/Prestige, resolve effect, draw child.

  - **Have Children**: Draw 1 Child card (or pay 1 Honor to choose gender).  
  - **Hire Fertility Doctor (Main Board)**: Pay 2 Gold + 1 Friend to draw 2 Child cards.  
- **Complications**:  
  - Draw Complication → choose: lose child, or lose mother (discard mother, draw until child).  
  - Only one Complication per Generation affects you.  
  - Head of Family cannot die; must lose child.  
- **Remarrying**: Only original family members (not Friends) can remarry after losing spouse. Child count carries over.  
- **Main Board Actions (one use per round)**:  
  - **Acquire Title**: Pay cost, gain Prestige/Income/Friends, place Title card.  
  - **Contribute to Community**: Pay cost, gain Honor/Prestige/Friends.  
  - **Buy a Mansion**: Pay 3 Gold + 1 Friend → +2 Prestige.  
  - **Initiate Venture**: Pay 2 Friends, lose 1 Prestige → +1 Income.  
  - **Undertake Mission**:  
    - Gen I–II: Draw 2 Mission cards, keep 1 (fulfill during game for rewards).  
    - Gen III: Draw 1, place face-down under Patron (unlocks 1 minor goal).  
  - **Hire Fertility Doctor**: As above.

    - 1 Friend: free  
    - 2 Friends: pay 1 Gold  
    - 3 Friends: pay 2 Gold  
    - If only 1 Friend remains face-up, take it free and replenish.  
- **Friend Card Rules**:  
  - Face-up Friends replenished only when all are taken.  
  - If deck runs out, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.
