## A Study In Emerald — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In an alternate 1882, the Old Ones have ruled Earth for centuries. Players secretly belong to one of two factions: the **Restorationists**, who seek to assassinate the royal Old Ones and incite revolution, or the **Loyalists**, who protect their rulers and aim to provoke war. Victory is determined by secret identities, hidden agendas, and Victory Points (VPs). The player with the most VPs wins—unless their faction has the lowest-scoring player, in which case their entire side is eliminated.

### 3. Setup
1. Shuffle the 6 Secret Identity cards and deal one face-down to each player. Return the rest to the box unseen.
2. Each player selects a color and takes:
   - 1 Main Agent counter
   - 10 Initial cards (shuffled into a draw deck)
   - 6 Influence cubes (Available stock), with the remaining 14 placed in the Pool
   - 15 Control discs
3. Shuffle the 60 Game cards:
   - 4 cards per city stack (4–5 players)
   - 3 cards per city stack (2–3 players)
   Place stacks face-down in the 12 Game Card boxes. Turn the top card face-up. If it is an Agent, place the matching Agent counter on it.
4. Place the 12 City cards face-up in the City Card box (alphabetical order).
5. Shuffle the 12 Permanent Effect cards and place them face-down beside the board. Draw the top 2 and place them face-up on display.
6. Shuffle the 22 Double Agent counters face-down. Deal:
   - 2 per player (4–5 players)
   - 3 per player (3 players)
   - 4 per player (2 players)
7. Place one Track marker on the 0 space of the War track and one on the 0 space of the Revolution track.
8. Each player places one Control disc on the 0 space of the Victory Points (VP) track.
9. Shuffle the Sanity counters into a face-down pile beside the board.
10. Each player shuffles their Initial deck and draws 5 cards.
11. Randomly determine the first player. In player order, each player places their Main Agent counter (human side up) in any city box. Multiple agents may occupy the same city.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Play proceeds clockwise.
- On your turn, perform exactly **2 actions** (any combination, in any order).
- After your actions, draw back to 5 cards. If your draw deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck.
- If you lose a card from your hand (out of turn), draw a replacement immediately. You always start your turn with at least 5 cards.
- Cards may be used for **only one purpose**: either their symbol(s) (cubes, gold, bombs, arrows) or their text action—not both.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Actions
- **Place Influence Cubes:** Play 1+ cards with cube symbols. Take that many cubes from your Available stock and place them on a single face-up Game card, Permanent Effect card, or in a City box. Cannot overpay unless using a 2-cube card with only 1 cube left.
- **Claim One Card:** Only as your **first action** and before any free actions.
  - You may claim a Game card, Permanent Effect card, or City card.
  - Requirement: You must have more Influence points than any other player, with at least one point from an Influence cube.
  - Influence = cubes + agents in the city.
  - Tiebreaker: Most agents in the city.
  - **Game Card:** Place on discard pile. If Agent, place counter in city and put your Control disc on it. Turn next card face-up. If last card claimed, move War marker up 2 spaces and draw a new Permanent Effect card.
  - **Permanent Effect Card:** Place face-up in front of you. No replacement drawn.
  - **City Card:** Take from deck or current controller. Place Control disc in city. Gain VPs equal to city value. Previous controller loses VPs and disc.
  - After claiming, your cubes go to Limbo; others return to their owners.
  - If card has Sanity symbol, draw 1 Sanity counter.
- **Retrieve Influence Cubes:** Play 1+ cards with cube symbols. Retrieve that many of your cubes from anywhere (Limbo, City boxes, cards) and place in Available stock. Cannot overpay unless using 2-cube card with only 1 cube to retrieve.
- **Buy Influence Cubes:** Play 1+ cards with gold symbols. For every 2 gold, take 1 cube from your Pool and add to Available stock. Must spend in multiples of 2. Cannot overpay.
- **Move Agents:** Play 1+ cards with gold symbols. Move 1+ of your agents (including Main Agent). Cost per connection is shown on board. Must use cheapest route. Cannot overpay unless cost is 1 and you play a 2-gold card.
- **Move Markers:** Play 1+ cards with arrow symbols. Choose one arrow per card:
  - Pink arrow: Move Revolution marker
  - Green arrow: Move War marker
  - Marker cannot go below 0. Must be able to move at least 1 space.
- **Discard Cards:** Discard 1+ cards. May hide identities by only showing the top card.
- **Reveal Your Secret Identity:** Only if doing so ends the game (e.g., your adjusted VP total meets the end-game threshold).
- **Reveal Double Agent:** Reveal one of your Double Agent counters. Take control of that Agent from another player. Replace their Control disc with yours. They return the Agent card to their hand, deck, or discard pile; you place it on your discard pile.
  - **Sherlock Holmes Exception:** If revealed and controller is a Restorationist, they may reveal identity to keep control.
  - **Professor Moriarty Exception:** If revealed and controller is a Loyalist, they may reveal identity to keep control.
- **Card Action:** Play a card for its text action.
  - "Free Action": Does not count toward your 2 actions.
  - "One Use Action": Card is removed from the game after use.
- **Pass:** End your turn early.

#### Assassinations & Hiding
- **Assassinate Royalty:**
  - Use Agent card (in matching city) or Hired Assassin card (any city with your agent).
  - Must match Bomb defense of the royal.
  - Bomb points = Bomb symbols on agents in city + Bomb symbols on cards played (not the action card).
  - Success: Place Control disc, gain VPs, draw Sanity counter.
  - If Mad counter drawn and Agent used, Agent is removed (exceptions: Sherlock Holmes, Professor Moriarty, Vampires).
- **Assassinate Agent:**
  - Same as above, but match city's Bomb defense.
  - Target must be controlled by a player "Known to the Authorities."
  - Cannot target Main Agent unless they have no other agents.
  - Success: Take Agent counter and Control disc (for end-game scoring).
- **Hide Royalty:** Same as Assassinate Royalty, but place Safe counter and your Control disc. Gain VPs and draw Sanity counter.

#### Known to the Authorities
- All players start unknown.
- Become known when you have actual or potential VPs:
  - Control city, assassinate/hide royalty, control agent with VP potential, War/Revolution track at VP level.
- Once known, agents can be targeted. Cannot become unknown again.

#### Special Card Actions
- **Bismarck:** Lock a city you control. All cubes (including yours) go to Limbo. Other players move agents out for free. Only your agents can enter. Only you can place cubes on its Game cards. No zombies allowed.
- **Vampires:** Flip one of your agents to vampire side, or convert another player's agent (if you have a vampire in same city and they are known). Vampires can assassinate, cannot be assassinated, not lost to Mad Sanity. If you are Loyalist, gain 1 VP per vampire at game end.
- **Zombies:** 1) Kill 1 agent per city where you have zombies (if legal target). 2) Place up to 3 zombies (in city with your agent/zombie or adjacent to one). Zombies can be killed by any assassination-capable card.
- **Cthulhu:** Destroy a city. All agents and cards removed. Players move Main Agents out. All other players draw Sanity counter. City is blocked.
- **Society of Leopold:** Remove all vampires and zombies. Vampire and Zombie cards become useless.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### Ending the Game
Game ends immediately when any of:
- War or Revolution marker reaches the top (space 15).
- A player reaches the VP threshold (based on player count).
- A Restorationist's Main Agent is killed (assassination, Shoggoth, or 3rd Mad Sanity counter).
- A player plays the Zombie card as their first action with all 8 zombies on board.

#### Scoring Victory Points
- **While Identity is Secret:** Score only for:
  - Cities controlled
  - Royalty assassinated or hidden
  - Necronomicon card (3 VPs)
- **When Identity is Revealed (or at game end):**
  - **All Players:**
    - Each controlled city: VP value shown
    - Necronomicon: 3 VPs
  - **Restorationists:**
    - Each assassinated royal: VP value shown
    - Revolution track: Highest VP-earning space reached
    - Non-vampire agents with VP symbol
    - Black Hand: +2 VPs per assassinated royal
  - **Loyalists:**
    - Each hidden royal: VP value shown
    - War track: Highest VP-earning space reached
    - Vampires: 1 VP per vampire agent (including Main Agent) if you control the Vampire card
    - Zombies: 8 VPs if you control the Zombie card and all 8 zombies are in play
    - Yog-Sothoth: 2 VPs per agent sacrificed to it
    - +1 VP per Restorationist agent you assassinated

#### Winning the Game
1. All players reveal identities and adjust VPs.
2. If all players are on the same side, highest VP wins.
3. If both sides present:
   - The side with the **lowest individual VP total** is eliminated.
   - If tie, Loyalists are eliminated.
   - The highest-scoring player on the remaining side wins.
4. If tie on winning side: Most Control discs wins. If still tied, share the win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Sanity Counters:** Draw when claiming Sanity-symbol card or assassinating/hiding royalty. "Sane" is discarded. "Mad" is kept. At 3 Mad counters, reveal identity. If Restorationist, game ends. If no counters left, assume 3 Mad counters drawn.
- **Hand Size:** Always start turn with 5 cards. If forced to lose a card, draw replacement immediately.
- **Double Agent:** Cannot reveal an assassinated agent. Only unclaimed or controlled agents.
- **Bismarck:** All cubes, including your own, go to Limbo.
- **Cthulhu:** Even if you go mad and die, the card's effect still occurs.
- **Tiebreakers:** For claiming, most agents in city breaks ties. For winning, most Control discs on board breaks ties.
