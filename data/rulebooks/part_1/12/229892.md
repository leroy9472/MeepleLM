### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn consists of:  
1. **Pre-Turn Actions** (mandatory, in order):  
   - Pay Interest: $1 per Loan to Bank (or Broker I/II in Investment Bank mode).  
   - Win Broker Auction (Investment Bank only): If holding Payment Card, collect won items and pay bid.  
2. **Normal Turn Actions** (choose any two):  
   - Buy a Machine or Warehouse  
   - Buy Containers for Harbor Store  
   - Produce Containers for Factory Store (once per turn)  
   - Sail the Ship  
   - Call the Broker (Investment Bank only)  

Play proceeds clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Pay Interest  
- At start of turn, pay $1 per Loan Card.  
- Max 2 Loans per player.  
- If unable to pay, Bank seizes 1 Container per unpaid Loan:  
  Order: Island → Ship → Investment Bank Dock → Harbor Store → Factory Store.  
- Player to the right chooses color if multiple options exist.

#### Buy Machine or Warehouse  
- Pay cost shown in next available slot on Player Board.  
- Cannot buy Machine of a color already owned.  
- Max 4 Warehouses per player.  
- Max one Machine per color.  
- Action can be taken twice per turn.

#### Buy Containers for Harbor Store  
- Buy from one other player’s Factory Store only.  
- Cannot exceed Warehouse capacity (1 container per Warehouse).  
- Pay listed price to factory owner.  
- Immediately place in Harbor Store and set new price ($2–$6).  
- May re-price all Harbor Store containers during this action.  
- May take action twice to buy from different players.

#### Produce Containers  
- Pay $1 to player on your right (Union Boss).  
- Produce 1 container per Machine (same color).  
- Cannot exceed Factory Store capacity (2 per Machine).  
- May re-price all Factory Store containers.  
- Must produce all possible containers if supply allows.  
- Limited to once per turn.

#### Sail the Ship  
- Move one area per action:  
  - Open Sea ↔ Player Harbor  
  - Open Sea ↔ Foreign Island  
  - Open Sea ↔ Investment Bank (if in use)  
- Cannot move directly between harbors or to own harbor.  
- **At Player Harbor:** May buy containers for Ship (up to 5 max). Purchase happens at end of move.  
- **At Foreign Island:** Conduct auction for all Ship containers. Turn ends immediately.  
- **At Investment Bank:** Load won containers from personal dock (if any).  

#### Auction at Foreign Island  
- All other players secretly bid using Money Cards (at least one card).  
- Simultaneously reveal bids.  
- Tie: Tied players make one additional secret bid. If still tied, active player chooses winner.  
- **Active player chooses:**  
  a) Accept highest bid: receive bid amount from bidder + equal government subsidy from Bank.  
  b) Decline all bids: pay highest bid amount to Bank, keep containers on Island. No subsidy.  
- Turn ends immediately.  
- $0 bids allowed. If all bid $0 twice, shipping player must accept at $0 cost.

#### Call the Broker (Investment Bank Only)  
- May not be used if ending game or if you just won an auction.  
- Place Broker Arrow on desired Broker Space (Containers or Money).  
- Place Payment Card by your board.  
- Bid:  
  - For Money: Place Containers (from Factory or Harbor Store) on Payment Card.  
  - For Containers: Place Money Cards on Payment Card.  
- Others may increase bid:  
  - +$1 for Money, +1 Container for Container bids.  
- Player losing Payment Card gets bid items back + free re-pricing.  
- Winner collects items at start of next turn (Money to hand, Containers to personal dock).  
- Bid payment distributed:  
  - Money: $1 per Broker in order (I→II→III→I…).  
  - Containers: 1 per Broker in order.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger:**  
- Game ends when any two container colors are depleted from supply.  
- Active player finishes turn; then scoring begins.  

**Final Scoring:**  
1. Reveal Container Value Cards.  
2. For each player:  
   - If they have at least one of each color on Island: their “5/10” color is worth $10 each. Otherwise, $5.  
   - Discard all containers of the color they have most of on Island.  
     - Tie: Player chooses, **unless** the “5/10” color is tied — then it must be discarded.  
   - Score remaining Island containers per Value Card.  
   - Add:  
     - $2 per container in Warehouses  
     - $3 per container on Ship  
     - $3 per container at Investment Bank personal dock (if in use)  
   - Subtract $11 per outstanding Loan.  
3. **Winner:** Highest total wins.  
   - Tiebreaker: Most containers in Factory Store.  
   - Still tied: Shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Passing:** Not a formal action, but possible by moving Ship without buying or re-pricing only.  
- **Empty Ship Auction:** Not allowed.  
- **Loan Repayment:** Can repay at any time during turn **after** paying interest.  
- **Auction Timing:** Turn ends immediately upon reaching Island — cannot repay loans after auction.  
- **Investment Bank Auctions:** Unresolved auctions at game end award Payment Card holder the bid.  
- **Bankruptcy:** Possible. A player with no money, containers, and 2 loans cannot pay interest and cannot recover — effectively out of game.  
- **Pricing:** Stacked containers in same price slot each cost full price (e.g., two $3 containers cost $6 total).  
- **Changing Money:** Players may make change freely at any time.  
- **Container Limits:** 3 per player +1 per color (total 17 in 5-player), plus 3 extra if Investment Bank used.
