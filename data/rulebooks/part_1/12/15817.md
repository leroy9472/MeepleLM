## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
It is 1821 in the Philippines, under nominal Spanish rule. In secret, native traders run a black-market maritime trade using fragile boats to smuggle goods like ginseng, silk, nutmeg, and jade into Manila. These ventures are risky—boats may sink, pirates may attack—but successful deliveries drive up prices on the black market. Players are merchants investing in goods, hiring accomplices, and manipulating voyages to maximize profit.

**Objective**: Accumulate the highest fortune by the end of the game. A player’s fortune is their cash in PESOS plus the black market value of owned shares, minus 15 PESOS for each unredeemed loan (encumbered share).

The game ends immediately after a round in which one or more wares reach a value of 30 on the black market.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with sea routes (0–13), port (A, B, C), shipyard (A, B, C), black market track (0–30), pilot island, pirate boat, insurance office  
- 3 dice (colored to match wares: ginseng, silk, nutmeg, jade)  
- 20 ware shares (3 each of ginseng, silk, nutmeg; 4 jade)  
- 20 accomplices (4 per player in 3–4 player games; 3 per player in 4-player game)  
- Peso coins (total 120–150 depending on player count)  
- Harbor cash box (central bank)  
- 4 value markers (one per ware, placed on black market track)

---

### 3. Setup  
- Each player receives:
  - 30 PESOS
  - 3 accomplices (4 in 3-player game)
- Shuffle 20 ware shares face down. Each player draws 2 shares—these are their starting stock, kept secret.
- Remaining shares are laid out by type next to the board for all to see.
- Place each ware’s value marker on the lowest space (0 or 5) of the black market track.
- Place punts, dice, and ware loads near the board.

**3-player variant**: Players get 4 accomplices each. The 2nd accomplice placement occurs before the 1st boat movement (so: placements 1 & 2 → move → placement 3 → move → placement 4 → move).

**2-player variant**:
- Deal 4 piles of 2 shares face down. Each player takes one pile.
- Remaining 4 shares form a hidden “dummy player” hand.
- Dummy places workers 2nd (after HM, before other player) unless it becomes Harbor Master.
- Harbor Master minimum bid = half of previous winning bid (rounded down). If no one meets it, dummy becomes HM.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round (voyage) follows this sequence:

#### 1. Auction and Perform Harbor Master (HM) Role  
- **Auction**:
  - Starting with previous HM (oldest player first in Round 1), players bid clockwise.
  - Players may pass; once passed, cannot re-enter.
  - Bids must be payable using current cash and available credit (via shares).
  - Winner pays bid to harbor cash box and becomes HM.
  - If no bids, previous HM retains role.
- **HM Actions** (in 3-player+ games):
  - **Buy a share**: Pay current black market price (minimum 5 PESOS) for any available share.
  - **Choose 3 wares to load**: One ware is left out.
  - **Set starting positions**: Assign each boat to a route (0–5), total starting spaces = 9.
  - **Choose start player** (optional in variants): HM places first; others follow clockwise.

**3-player variant HM actions**:
- After auction, HM chooses 1 of 4 actions.
- Last player to pass chooses 1 of remaining actions.
- Second-to-last passer gets final action.
- Actions resolved in fixed order: Buy Share → Load Goods → Place Boats → Choose Start Player.

**2-player variant**:
- HM chooses 1 action, other player chooses 1, HM gets remaining.
- Dummy never bids; if no one meets minimum bid, dummy becomes HM and:
  - Draws 1 of its 4 hidden shares—this is the *unloaded* good.
  - Randomly selects 1 of the other 3 to "buy" (no payment).
  - Sets all boats to start at space 3.
  - Dummy places workers first, then former HM, then other player.

#### 2. Place Accomplices and Move Boats  
Three rounds of placement and movement (four placements in 3-player game):

- **Accomplice Placement**:
  - Starting with HM (or designated first player), each player places one accomplice on a vacant space and pays cost to harbor cash box.
  - Spaces:
    - **Ware spaces**: On boats (3 spaces each for ginseng, silk, nutmeg; 4 for jade). Pay cost shown. Pawns split profits if boat reaches Manila.
    - **Port/Shipyard**: Adjacent to docking spaces A, B, C. Earn fixed reward if boat docks/lands there.
    - **Pirate**: Two spaces—captain (front), second pirate. Pirates may board or plunder boats on space 13.
    - **Pilot**: Small pilot (2 PESOS), large pilot (4 PESOS). Act before 3rd dice roll.
    - **Insurance Agent**: Pay nothing; receive 10 PESOS immediately. Must later pay repair costs for boats in shipyard.
  - A player may pass at any time—no further placements.
  - **Blind Passenger Rule**: If a player has no money and no unencumbered shares, they may place accomplices for free (except on Insurance Agent).

- **Boat Movement**:
  - After each placement round (except final), HM rolls 3 dice (one per loaded ware) and moves corresponding boats forward that many spaces.
  - Boats passing space 13 go to next available port space (A → B → C).
  - After 2nd movement:
    - Any boat on space 13 may be **boarded** by pirates if space available.
    - If no space, pirate may displace non-pirate pawn (variant rule).
    - Captain boards first; if he boards, second pirate becomes new captain.
  - Before 3rd movement:
    - **Pilots act**:
      - Small pilot: move any one boat ±1 space.
      - Large pilot: move one boat ±2, or two boats ±1 each.
      - Cannot affect boats already in port.
  - After 3rd movement:
    - Any boat ending on space 13 is **plundered**:
      - All non-pirate pawns removed.
      - Pirates split profit from that boat (paid by bank).
      - Pirate captain decides whether boat goes to port or shipyard.
    - Boats past 13 go to port.
    - Other boats go to shipyard (A, B, C in order).

#### 3. Profit Distribution  
- **Pirates**: Split profit of each plundered boat (value shown on boat). Paid by harbor cash box.
- **Ware Pawns**: If boat reaches port, pawns split profit shown on boat.
- **Port Masters**: Earn reward if boat docks in adjacent port space.
- **Shipyard Masters**: Earn reward if boat lands in adjacent shipyard space.
  - Paid by **Insurance Agent** if one exists; otherwise by harbor cash box.
- **Insurance Agent**:
  - Received 10 PESOS at placement.
  - Pays repair costs for all shipyard boats (to players or bank).
  - May take loans to pay; if still short, harbor cash box covers remainder.
  - No obligation to repay bank-covered amounts.

#### 4. Raise Ware Values  
- For each ware delivered to Manila (port), advance its value marker **+1 level** on black market (e.g., 5 → 10).
- If **any ware reaches 30**, this was the final round. Proceed to end game.
- Reset boats, wares, and return all accomplices to players.
- Begin next voyage with HM auction.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Taking Credit (Loans)  
- At any time, a player may **encumber** a share to take **12 PESOS** from bank.
  - Place share face-down in play area.
- To **repay**, pay **15 PESOS** to bank; return share to active stock.
- At game end, each encumbered share:
  - Is **not scored** for its market value.
  - Costs **–15 PESOS** to the player.

#### Blind Passenger  
- A player with **no money** and **no unencumbered shares** may place accomplices for free (except on Insurance).
- Continues until they earn money or take credit.

#### Pirates (Official Variant)  
- After 2nd movement: Pirates may **board** boats on space 13 if space available.
  - If no space, pirate may **displace** a non-pirate pawn (not another pirate).
  - Captain boards first; second pirate becomes new captain if captain boards.
- After 3rd movement: Pirates **plunder** any boat on space 13.
  - All non-pirate pawns removed.
  - Pirates split profit.
  - Captain decides destination (port or shipyard).

#### 2-Player Dummy Worker Placement  
- After each placement phase, roll the die *not* associated with a loaded ware.
- Result determines where dummy places:
  - **1**: Cheapest free space (A → B → C)
  - **2**: 1st/2nd placement: left boat; 3rd/4th: insurance
  - **3**: 1st/2nd: middle boat; 3rd/4th: front-most boat (highest return)
  - **4**: 1st/2nd: right boat; 3rd/4th: pilots (small → big)
  - **5**: Pirates—always board highest-value boat first; if full, displace non-dummy pawn
  - **6**: Shipyard—cheapest free space (A → B → C)
- If space occupied, move to next (wrap from 6 → 1).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends **immediately after** a round in which **one or more wares reach 30** on the black market.

Each player calculates their **fortune**:
1. Count all **PESOS** in cash.
2. Add **value of each owned share** (current black market price).
3. Subtract **15 PESOS** for each **encumbered (loaned) share**.

**Highest total wins.** No tiebreaker specified.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a player place multiple pawns on same boat or space?**  
  Yes—on any space with open slots (boats have limited spaces; port/shipyard/pilot/pirate have 1 each).

- **What if a player can’t pay insurance costs?**  
  They must take loans if possible. If still short, harbor cash box pays the rest. No repayment required.

- **Can pilots move a boat past 13?**  
  Yes—this counts as arrival in port.

- **Can a boat be moved to 13 by pilots?**  
  Yes—but pirates do **not** activate unless it ends there after a dice roll.

- **What if all boats fail to reach 13?**  
  All go to shipyard. Pirates get nothing unless they plundered on 3rd roll.

- **Can a player bid more than they can pay?**  
  No—maximum bid = cash + available credit (12 per unencumbered share).

- **What if no one wants to be HM in 2-player game?**  
  Minimum bid = half previous bid (rounded down). If no one meets it, dummy becomes HM.

- **Do encumbered shares count toward scoring?**  
  No—they are not scored, and cost –15 each.
