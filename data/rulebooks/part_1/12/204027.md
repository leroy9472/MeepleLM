## Cottage Garden — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
As gardeners, players compete to design beautiful flowerbeds using colorful flower tiles, flowerpots, and garden cloches. The goal is to score the most points by completing flowerbeds and advancing scoring markers on dual tracks. The game emphasizes spatial planning and efficient use of limited space.

2. Components  
- 1 double-sided Nursery board (1-3 or 4-player side)  
- 36 Flower Tiles (puzzle-shaped cardboard tiles of varying sizes)  
- 9 Flowerbeds (each with light and dark sides)  
- 1 green Gardener die (numbered 1–6)  
- 1 Wheelbarrow (cardboard piece)  
- 1 Parasol token (cardboard)  
- 30 Cat tokens  
- 16 Flower Pot tokens  
- 2 Beehive bonus tiles (1 with two beehives, 1 with one)  
- 4 Planting Tables (player boards)  
- 12 orange Scoring Cubes (3 per player)  
- 12 blue Scoring Cubes (3 per player)

3. Setup  
- Place Nursery board in center, showing side matching player count (1-3 or 4 players).  
- Fill 16 Nursery spaces with random Flower Tiles.  
- Place remaining 20 Flower Tiles in a line (Garden Path) next to Nursery; place Wheelbarrow at one end.  
- Each player receives:  
  • 1 Planting Table  
  • 3 orange and 3 blue Scoring Cubes (on Starting Space)  
  • 2 Flowerbeds (one light side up, one dark side up)  
  • 2 Cat tokens  
- Place General Supply beside Nursery:  
  • 1 Flowerbed (light side up)  
  • Parasol, remaining Cats, Flower Pots, Beehives  
- Place Gardener die:  
  • On “1” face (3–4 players) or “2” face (1–2 players)  
  • On corresponding starting space on Nursery board  
- Return unused components to box.  
- Starting player: last person to have weeded a garden.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn consists of four phases:  
1. Refilling Phase  
2. Planting Phase  
3. Scoring Phase  
4. Gardener Phase  

Turns proceed clockwise.  
- 2 players: 32 turns before Final Round  
- 3 players: 26 turns  
- 4 players: 25 turns  

5. Core Mechanics  
**Refilling Phase**  
- Identify Gardener Row: the row/column (or diagonal in 4-player) aligned with Gardener die.  
- If 3 or 4 spaces in Gardener Row are empty:  
  1. Take Flower Tile from front of Garden Path (in front of Wheelbarrow).  
  2. Place it on the empty space closest to Gardener.  
  3. Move Wheelbarrow forward one space.  
  4. Repeat until row is full or no tiles remain.  
- If only 1 or 2 spaces are empty: optional “Ramble” action.  
  • Return 1 Cat to General Supply to trigger full refill (same steps).  

**Planting Phase**  
Must take one of:  
a) **Take a Flower Tile**: Select one from Gardener Row and immediately place it on one of your Flowerbeds.  
b) **Take a Flower Pot**: Take one from General Supply and immediately place on a Flowerbed.  
- Additionally: **Mouse Hunt** – Place any number of Cats from reserve onto empty spaces on your Flowerbeds (optional, free action).  

**Planting Rules**  
- Flower Tiles may be rotated and flipped before placement.  
- Must fit entirely within a Flowerbed (no overhang).  
- May not overlap tiles, pots, cats, or edges.  
- May cover printed Flower Pots or Garden Cloches on the board (but these will not score).  
- Once placed, tiles cannot be moved.  
- Same rules apply to Flower Pots and Cats.  
- Parasol: may temporarily take any Nursery tile to test fit; mark space with Parasol. Return before turn ends.  

**Scoring Phase**  
- A Flowerbed is complete when all spaces are filled (by tiles, pots, cats, or printed features).  
- Score immediately:  
  • Move **one** orange cube forward on orange track: 1 space per **visible** Flower Pot (printed or token).  
  • Move **one** blue cube forward on blue track: 1 space per **visible** Garden Cloche (printed or token).  
- Covered pots/cloches and cats score nothing.  
- Cannot split score between cubes of same color. Choose which cube to move.  
- Reaching Target Space (20 points):  
  • Only one step from 14/15 to Target Space. Any excess movement is lost.  
  • First player to reach Target Space takes 2-Beehive tile.  
  • Second player takes 1-Beehive tile.  
  • Each beehive = 1 point at game end.  

**Special Rules for Planting Table**  
- Crossing red line (with mice) forward: gain 1 Cat (may use immediately).  
- Moving last of 3 orange/blue cubes from Starting Space: gain 1 Flower Pot (must place immediately).  
- Max 2 Cats in reserve at end of turn: if more, place excess immediately (may trigger scoring).  
- If all cubes of one color are on Target Space, no further scoring in that color.  

**Cleanup & Replacement**  
After scoring:  
1. Return Flower Pots and Cats from Flowerbed to General Supply.  
2. Return all Flower Tiles to end of Garden Path (any order).  
3. Flip scored Flowerbed to opposite side and place in General Supply.  
4. Take other Flowerbed from General Supply and place beside remaining one (do not flip).  

**Gardener Phase**  
- Move Gardener die one space clockwise.  
- When reaching Turning Space:  
  • 2/4 players: Turning Space = Starting Space  
  • 3 players: Turning Space is 2 spaces before Starting Space  
  • Increase Gardener die value by 1.  
- When die shows “6”, Final Round begins.

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Final Round**  
- Begins when Gardener die shows “6”.  
- Immediately discard all Flowerbeds with ≤2 Flower Tiles (pots/cats don’t count).  
- Rule changes:  
  • Before each turn: lose 2 points by either:  
    - Move 1 orange cube back 2 spaces, or  
    - Move 1 blue cube back 1 space.  
  • If forced to move from Target Space (20), lose 5–6 points.  
  • Completing a Flowerbed: remove it (no replacement).  
  • If no Flowerbeds at start of turn: skip phases 1–3, only perform Gardener Phase.  
  • Bonuses (Cat, Flower Pot) still apply if triggered.  
  • Moving back across red line does not grant Cats.  

**End of Game**  
- Game ends when all Flowerbeds are removed.  
- Final scoring:  
  • Each orange cube: 1–15 points (or 20 if on Target Space)  
  • Each blue cube: 2–14 points (by twos; or 20 if on Target Space)  
  • Each beehive: 1 point  
  • No points for cubes on Starting Space or Cats in reserve  
- Highest score wins. Tiebreaker: most beehives.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I score both Flowerbeds in one turn?**  
  Yes, if both are completed (e.g., via Cat placement). Choose scoring order.  
- **What if I can’t refill due to lack of tiles?**  
  Refill as many spaces as possible. Remaining spaces stay empty.  
- **Can I score after moving cubes backward?**  
  Yes. Moving back may cross red line again forward (grants Cat).  
- **Can I use a Flower Pot to complete and score a Flowerbed?**  
  Yes. Immediate scoring applies.  
- **Do I get a Cat when moving cube backward across red line?**  
  No. Only forward movement grants Cats.  
- **Can I choose which cube to move when scoring?**  
  Yes. You may choose any orange or blue cube.  
- **What if all my cubes are on Target Space?**  
  Cannot score further in that color.
