## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You command a fleet in the Caribbean, representing a nation vying for wealth and dominance. Your flotilla consists of a merchant ship, a pirate ship, and influence over one of two navy ships. The goal is to earn doubloons through trade, piracy, and naval warfare, then use that wealth to flip all five of your personal development and victory cards face-up. The first player to flip their Victory card wins—provided all four prior Development cards are already face-up.

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board (Caribbean sea with ports, beaches, and distant sea zones)  
- 10 ships:  
  - 4 Merchant ships (1 per player)  
  - 4 Pirate ships (1 per player)  
  - 2 Navy ships (Yellow and Purple)  
- 65 Goods cubes (13 in each of 5 colors)  
- 30 Doubloons:  
  - 10 gold (value 5)  
  - 20 silver (value 1)  
- 44 Movement cards  
- 44 Fortune cards  
- 24 Development cards (6 cards each at costs: 5, 8, 11, 14)  
- 8 Victory cards (4 at 10-doubloon cost, 4 at 20-doubloon cost)  
- 4 Player identification cards (used to complete development card display)  
- 4 First-player selection cards  

### 3. Setup  
- Place the board in the center.  
- Place both Navy ships on their designated starting spaces.  
- Place Goods cubes near their corresponding ports.  
- Shuffle the Fortune cards into a face-down deck. Each player draws 1.  
- Shuffle the Movement cards. Deal 2 to each player. Form a draw deck with the rest.  
- Separate Development cards into 4 decks by cost (5, 8, 11, 14). Shuffle each deck.  
- Deal 1 card from each deck to every player. Players place these face-down in front of them in ascending order (left to right: 5, 8, 11, 14). Return unused cards to the box.  
- Place one Victory card (10-value for shorter game, 20-value for longer) to the right of each player's Development cards.  
- Deal one First-player selection card to each player and reveal them. The player with the Black Fleet card is first.  
- Each player takes their colored Merchant and Pirate ships.  
- Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise:  
  - Place your Merchant ship on one of the three spaces adjacent to any port.  
  - Load it with 3 Goods cubes matching the port’s color.  
- Pirate ships start off the board.  
- The first player begins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, resolve the following steps **in exact order**:

1. **Play a Movement card**  
   - Choose and reveal one Movement card from your hand.  
   - The top three lines show movement values for:  
     - Navy ship (color-matched to card)  
     - Pirate ship  
     - Merchant ship  
   - The bottom line shows Fortune card effects at end of turn (draw 1, draw 2, or discard 1).

2. **Move Ships, Perform Actions, and Play Fortune Cards**  
   - You may move:  
     - Your Pirate  
     - Your Merchant  
     - The Navy ship shown on your Movement card (only one navy per turn)  
   - Movement Rules:  
     - Each ship may move up to its Movement card value.  
     - Ships move only on sea spaces.  
     - Ships may move through friendly ships (yours or the navy ship you control).  
     - Ships may not move through opponent ships.  
     - A ship may not end its movement on a space occupied by another ship.  
     - Move ships in any order, but complete one ship’s full movement before starting another’s.  
   - Actions:  
     - Each ship may perform **one action** per turn (before, during, or after movement).  
     - Actions include attacking, selling/loading, or burying treasure.  
   - Fortune Cards:  
     - Play any number during your turn.  
     - Effects are as printed; card text overrides rulebook.  
     - Cannot play during other players’ turns.

3. **Draw Cards**  
   - Draw enough Movement cards to have 2 in hand (usually 1).  
   - If your played Movement card has a draw symbol, draw the indicated number of Fortune cards.  
   - Maximum hand size: 3 Fortune cards. Discard down if exceeded.  
   - If a card requires discarding a Fortune card and you have none, no effect.  
   - If a deck is empty, reshuffle its discard pile to form a new deck.

4. **Optional: Flip a Development/Victory Card**  
   - Pay the doubloon cost of **one** face-down Development or Victory card in front of you.  
   - Flip it face-up.  
   - Development cards may be flipped in any order.  
   - Victory card may only be flipped **after** all four Development cards are face-up.  
   - You may only flip **one card per turn**, regardless of wealth.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Navy Ship  
- Role: Sink opposing Pirate ships.  
- Movement: Up to value on Movement card (typically 2–3).  
- Action: Before, during, or after movement, attack an adjacent **opposing Pirate**.  
  - The Pirate is sunk and returned to its owner.  
  - You gain 2 doubloons.  
  - If the Pirate was carrying a treasure (goods cube), return the cube to its port’s stock.  
- Cannot attack own or allied ships.  
- Attacking counts as the Navy ship’s one action.

#### Merchant Ship  
- Role: Transport and sell goods (max 3 per ship).  
- Starts fully loaded.  
- Action: If adjacent to a port, may **sell all cargo** and immediately **load 3 new goods** of the port’s color.  
  - Selling price: 2 or 3 doubloons per cube (indicated on port).  
  - Cannot sell goods in a port that does not accept their color.  
  - Loading without selling first is **not allowed**.  
- If Merchant is sunk, at the start of your next turn:  
  - Place it adjacent to any port.  
  - Load 3 goods of that port’s color.  
  - Then take your full turn.  
- Selling and loading is a single action.

#### Pirate Ship  
- Role: Steal goods from Merchants and bury them as treasure (max 1 treasure per Pirate).  
- Entering Play:  
  - If Pirate is not in play (sunk or first turn), at the start of your turn:  
    - Place it on any distant sea zone.  
    - It then moves and acts normally.  
- Action Options:  
  - **Steal from Merchant (if empty)**:  
    - Attack adjacent **opposing Merchant**.  
    - Take 1 goods cube (placed in hold; now called treasure).  
    - Gain 2 doubloons.  
    - If Merchant is now empty, it is sunk and returned to owner.  
    - Stealing is an action.  
  - **Bury Treasure (if carrying one)**:  
    - While on a beach space, bury the treasure.  
    - Return the cube to its port’s stock.  
    - Gain doubloons as shown on the beach (e.g., 4, 5, or 6).  
    - Burying is an action.  
- Cannot both steal and bury in the same turn (only one action per ship).  
- Cannot attack own or allied ships.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory Condition**: Flip your Victory card face-up (cost: 10 or 20 doubloons).  
- **Prerequisite**: All four Development cards must already be face-up.  
- **Final Round Trigger**: As soon as any player flips their Victory card, the final round begins.  
- The final turn belongs to the player immediately to the right of the first player (Black Fleet).  
- All players get the same number of turns.  
- **Winner**:  
  - The player who flipped their Victory card wins.  
  - If multiple players flipped it, the richest (most doubloons) wins.  
  - Tie in wealth? Co-winners (rare).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I do two actions with one ship?**  
  No. Each ship may perform only one action per turn—unless a Development or Fortune card explicitly allows more.  
- **Can I attack my own ships?**  
  No. Never. Not even to trigger effects.  
- **Can I load cargo without selling?**  
  No. Must sell first, then load. If attacked and partially looted, you cannot reload until you sell what remains.  
- **Can I move and attack with the same ship?**  
  Yes. Move before, during, or after—action can occur at any point in movement.  
- **Can I use Fortune Cards on other players’ turns?**  
  No. Only during your own turn.  
- **What happens if I run out of Movement or Fortune cards?**  
  Reshuffle the respective discard pile to form a new draw deck.  
- **Do card effects override the rules?**  
  Yes. If a Fortune or Development card contradicts the rulebook, **the card text takes precedence**.  
- **What are the skulls on the board?**  
  Pirate lairs. Their use is revealed only through specific Development or Fortune cards.  
- **Can I flip multiple Development cards per turn?**  
  No. Only one Development or Victory card may be flipped per turn.  
- **Can a Pirate bury treasure the turn it returns from being sunk?**  
  Yes. After placing it on a distant sea zone, it can move and bury if conditions are met.  
- **Can a Merchant sell and reload the turn it returns after being sunk?**  
  Yes. After placement and loading, it can take a full turn, including selling.
