### 1. Lore & Objective
Haggis is a climbing, trick-taking, shedding card game where players aim to be the first to play all their cards ("go out") while strategically capturing scoring cards and placing bets on their performance. The ultimate goal is to accumulate the highest score over multiple rounds.

### 2. Components
- **114 Cards**:
  - 90 Suit Cards: 2-10 in five suits, two copies each
  - 12 Court Cards: 4 Jacks, 4 Queens, 4 Kings (double-sided)
  - 12 Betting Cards: 4 Baby Bets (5 pts), 4 Little Bets (15 pts), 4 Big Bets (30 pts)
- 14 Player Aid Cards

### 3. Setup
**For 2 Players:**
1. Prepare a deck of 36 suit cards using one copy of 2-10 in any four suits.
2. The last player to travel to Scotland becomes the lead player.
3. Place one Jack, Queen, and King in front of each player (court cards are part of the hand).
4. Shuffle the 36 suit cards and set aside 8 cards face down (The Haggis).
5. Deal 14 suit cards face down to each player. Each player’s hand consists of 14 suit cards + 3 court cards = 17 cards total.
6. Place one Baby, Little, and Big Bet in front of each player (not part of hand).

**For 3 Players:**
1. Prepare a deck of 45 suit cards using one copy of 2-10 in all five suits.
2. The last player to travel to Scotland becomes the lead player.
3. Place one Jack, Queen, and King in front of each player.
4. Shuffle the 45 suit cards and set aside 3 cards face down (The Haggis).
5. Deal 14 suit cards face down to each player. Each player’s hand consists of 14 suit cards + 3 court cards = 17 cards total.
6. Place one Baby, Little, and Big Bet in front of each player.

**Game End Conditions:**
- Suggested: 250 points (short game) or 350 points (long game); or 6/8 rounds (2p), 6/9 rounds (3p). Play continues until target is met regardless of time.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Betting Phase**: Before playing any card, players may place a bet (Baby: 5, Little: 15, Big: 30) predicting they will go out first. Bets cannot be altered or retracted once made.
2. **Lead**: The player with the fewest points leads the first trick. If tied, the player to the left of the previous round's leader leads.
3. **Trick Play**:
   - The lead player plays a valid combination (Single, Set, Sequence, Stair, or Bomb).
   - Players must play a higher-ranking combination of the same type and size, play a bomb, or pass.
   - A bomb beats any non-bomb; only a higher bomb can beat a bomb.
   - Players who pass may still play later in the same trick if it hasn't ended.
4. **End of Trick**:
   - **2 Players**: Trick ends when one player passes.
   - **3 Players**: Trick ends when two players pass consecutively.
   - Winner captures cards unless trick was won by a bomb (then opponent captures).
   - Winner leads next trick; if winner has gone out, player to their left leads.
5. **Going Out**:
   - When a player plays their last card(s), they "go out."
   - **2p**: Round ends immediately. The player who went out wins.
   - **3p**: Round is paused. The first player to go out records the number of cards in the hand of the player with the most cards. Play continues. When a second player goes out, the round ends immediately.
6. **Ending the Round**:
   - The player who went out first captures the remaining cards in the other player's hand and the Haggis (2p), or the last player's hand and Haggis (3p).
   - In 3p, the second player to go out captures the cards from the final trick.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Combinations**:
  - **Single**: One card.
  - **Set**: Two or more cards of the same rank.
  - **Sequence (Run)**: Three or more consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 5♠, 6♠, 7♠).
  - **Stair**: Two or more consecutive sets of the same size and shared suits (e.g., 4♠, 4♦, 5♠, 5♦).
- **Court Cards (J, Q, K)**:
  - Can be played as their natural rank.
  - Can be used as wild cards for any lower-ranked card when played with at least one suit card.
  - A combination of multiple court cards without a suit card is always a bomb.
- **Bombs**:
  - Special combinations that can beat any play except a higher bomb.
  - Types (ranked low to high):
    1. 3-5-7-9 (four different suits, no wilds)
    2. J-Q
    3. J-K
    4. Q-K
    5. J-Q-K
    6. 3-5-7-9 (same suit, no wilds)
  - When a bomb wins a trick, the captured cards go to an opponent (winner chooses in casual play; in tournament, player who last played before bomb wins them).
- **Passing**: A player may pass but can still play later in the same trick if it hasn't ended.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Scoring Categories:**
- **Opponent's Hand**: 5 points per card remaining in the opponent's hand at the time of going out.
- **Captured Cards**: 
  - *Old Rule*: 3,5,7,9 = 1pt; J = 2pts; Q = 3pts; K = 5pts.
  - *New Rule (recommended)*: 1 point per card captured, regardless of rank.
- **Bets**:
  - If successful: player scores the bet amount.
  - If unsuccessful: the player who went out first scores the bet amount, and any player who did not bet also scores the full bet amount (not split).

**End of Game**:
- Game ends when a player reaches the agreed score (e.g., 250 or 350) or number of rounds.
- The player with the most points wins. If tied, play additional rounds until a winner emerges.

**Next Round Setup**:
- The player with the lowest overall score leads the next round.
- If tied, the player to the left of the previous round's leader leads.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a player bet after passing?** Yes, as long as they haven’t played a card. The non-lead player can pass initially and bet before playing their first card.
- **What happens if all players pass in betting?** The round proceeds without bets; the player with fewest points leads.
- **Can court cards be used in 3-5-7-9 bombs?** No. Wilds cannot be used in 3-5-7-9 bombs.
- **Do court cards count in hand size?** Yes. Unplayed J, Q, K count toward the number of cards in hand for scoring.
- **Who captures cards if a bomb wins?** An opponent captures them. In casual play, the winner chooses; in tournament, the player who last played a non-bomb combination captures them (if bomb was led, player to the right captures).
- **Can a player go out by playing a bomb?** Yes. If the bomb is the last card(s), the player goes out, and the opponent captures the trick.
