## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Fauna is an animal trivia game where players estimate the habitats and physical characteristics of animals. The goal is to score the most points by correctly guessing or closely approximating an animal’s geographic range and physical measurements (weight, length, height, total length, tail length). Points are awarded for correct guesses and adjacent guesses, encouraging educated estimation even when exact knowledge is lacking.

### 2. Components
- 1 double-sided world map board (Metric / Imperial)
- 180 double-sided animal cards (360 animals total)
- 42 guess tokens (7 per color, 6 player colors)
- 30 black evaluation markers
- 1 animal reference booklet
- 1 card box

### 3. Setup
1. Place the world map board in the center with the preferred unit side (Metric or Imperial) face up.
2. Each player chooses a color and takes 7 guess tokens. Place one token on the "1" space of the scoring track to mark starting score.
3. Place the evaluation markers near the board.
4. Shuffle and place all animal cards into the card box (full box recommended, though only 10–15 used per game).
5. The player with the most exotic pet becomes the starting player and takes the card box.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of three phases:

**I. Placing Guess Tokens**
- Starting player reveals the top animal card’s front side (visible to all).
- On the card: animal class, names, illustration, number of wild habitats, and measurable aspects (weight, length, height, total length, tail length).
- Starting with the starting player and proceeding clockwise, each player places one guess token:
  - On an empty space on the world map (land or sea), or
  - On an empty space in one of the applicable measurement scales.
- Sea areas include islands within them unless marked as land areas (e.g., Caribbean includes islands; Japan is part of Northwest Pacific Ocean).
- After all players place a token, the turn order repeats from the starting player.
- On subsequent turns, players may:
  - Place another guess token, or
  - Pass.
- Once a player passes, they cannot place more tokens this round.
- Phase ends when all players have passed.

**II. Evaluation**
1. Reveal the bottom half of the animal card:
   - Correct wild habitat areas (highlighted on map).
   - Average values for each measurable aspect in both units.
2. **Evaluate Map Areas:**
   - Place black evaluation markers on correct areas.
   - Score points for:
     - Correct area: points based on total number of areas (see scoring table).
     - Adjacent area (shares border or connected sea/land): lower points, only if animal is found in 16 or fewer areas.
   - Adjacent areas connected by dashed white lines or sea-land proximity.
   - Each token scores only once (priority: correct over adjacent).
3. **Evaluate Scales:**
   - For each applicable measurement scale:
     - Correct space: 7 points.
     - Adjacent space: 3 points.
     - No points otherwise.
4. **Token Cleanup:**
   - Tokens that scored are returned to their owners.
   - Tokens that didn’t score are returned to the supply.

**III. Starting Player Change & Preparation**
- Pass the card box to the player to the left of the current starting player.
- Each player retrieves 1 guess token from the supply (if available).
- Any player with fewer than 3 guess tokens replenishes to 3.
- The next round begins with the new starting player.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Guessing Mechanism:** Players place tokens on map areas or measurement scales.
- **Scoring for Proximity:** Partial credit given for adjacent guesses on both map and scales.
- **Token Management:** Players start with 7 tokens; must manage risk of losing tokens on incorrect guesses.
- **Progressive Rounds:** Game continues until a player reaches endgame threshold.
- **Animal Card Use:** After evaluation, card is discarded to the bottom of the box.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Scoring Table – Map Areas:**
| Number of Areas | Correct Area | Adjacent Area (only if ≤16 areas) |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 1                | 10 pts       | —                             |
| 2–3              | 9 pts        | —                             |
| 4–5              | 8 pts        | —                             |
| 6–7              | 7 pts        | —                             |
| 8–9              | 6 pts        | —                             |
| 10–12            | 5 pts        | —                             |
| 13–16            | 4 pts        | 1 pt                          |
| 17–20            | 3 pts        | —                             |
| 21–25            | 2 pts        | —                             |
| 26+              | 1 pt         | —                             |

**Scoring – Scales:**
- Correct space: 7 points
- Adjacent space: 3 points
- No points otherwise

**Game End:**
- Game ends immediately after evaluation when any player reaches:
  - 2–3 players: 120 points
  - 4–5 players: 100 points
  - 6 players: 80 points
- The player with the most points wins.
- In case of a tie, all tied players win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Is the Mediterranean Sea adjacent to the North Atlantic Ocean?** Yes.
- **Do sea depth colors affect gameplay?** No, only visual.
- **Are Iberian Peninsula and Atlas Mountains adjacent?** No – separated by Strait of Gibraltar.
- **Is Tasmania adjacent to mainland Australia areas?** No – only adjacent to Tasman Sea.
- **Is Japan part of Northwest Pacific Ocean?** Yes – sea areas include islands within unless marked as land.
- **Are Turan Depression and Western Asia adjacent?** No – separated by Caspian Sea (no dashed line).
- **Are Arabia and Horn of Africa adjacent?** No – separated by Red Sea.
- **Is Red Sea part of Northern Indian Ocean?** Yes – and it is adjacent to Eastern Sahara and Sahel.
- **Difference between 0 and N/A?**
  - 0: extremely small (first space on scale is correct).
  - N/A: insufficient data – no points possible for that scale.
- **Central America** includes southern Mexico for gameplay.
- **Katanga** is retained as a habitat area despite historical dissolution.
- **Green-bordered cards** are easier; **black-bordered cards** are harder (optional difficulty indicator).
