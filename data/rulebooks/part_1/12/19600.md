### 1. Lore & Objective
Antike is a strategy game about ancient civilizations competing not through territorial dominance, but by attracting influential historical figures—Kings, Scholars, Generals, Citizens, and Navigators. Players represent ancient nations such as Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians, and Persians, striving to achieve cultural and military supremacy. The objective is to be the first to acquire a set number of Ancient Personalities (victory points), or, in certain cases, to destroy an opponent’s temple when all personalities are claimed.

### 2. Components

  - 7 Generals
  - 6 Citizens
  - 5 Navigators
- Resource markers: Iron (blue), Marble (white), Gold (yellow), in 1-, 2-, and 5-unit denominations
- 30 coins (usable as 1-unit resources)
- 20 white temples (reduced to 14 for 2 players)
- 150 city discs (25 per nation, 6 colors)
- 102 legions (17 per nation, 6 colors)
- 102 galleys (17 per nation, 6 colors)
- 36 octagonal game stones (6 per nation, for rondel and progress tracking)

### 3. Setup
#### General Setup:
1. **Choose Board Side**: West (Roman Empire) or East (Alexander’s Empire).
2. **Determine Participating Nations**:
   - 2 players: 4 nations total (each player controls 2)
     - West: One player controls Romans & Phoenicians; other controls Germans & Greeks
     - East: One player controls Persians & Phoenicians; other controls Greeks & Arabs
   - 3–6 players: 1 nation per player
3. **Distribute Materials**:
   - Each nation receives:
     - 1 Iron, 2 Marble, 3 Gold
     - 25 city discs, 17 legions, 17 galleys, 6 octagonal stones
4. **Place Starting Cities**:
   - Each nation claims 3 cities (1 gold, 1 iron, 1 marble) based on number of players, as listed on nation cards.
   - Use nation card rows: Line 3 (3 nations), Line 4 (4 nations), etc.
5. **Prepare Bank**:
   - Sort Personality cards into 5 stacks (Kings, Scholars, etc.), lowest number on top.
   - Place temples, resources, and coins beside the board.
6. **Determine First Player**:
   - Nation with red dot on its card for the current player count goes first.

#### 2-Player Specific Adjustments:
- Use **half-map** (left or right side only) per scenario.
- Use **board dividers** to block unused half.
- Use **revised progress chart overlay**.
- **Temple count**: 14 available (instead of 20).
- **Victory condition**: First nation to acquire **10 personalities** or destroy opponent’s last city.
- **Arming cost**: 2 Iron per unit (instead of 1).
- **Know-How costs**: Basic 6/3, Advanced 9/5 (instead of 7/3 and 10/5).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn consists of:
1. **Take a Coin**: Receive 1 coin from the bank (usable as any 1-unit resource). If none remain, take 1 resource of your choice.
2. **Move on Rondel**:
   - Move 1–3 spaces clockwise for free.
   - Pay 1 resource per space beyond 3.
   - Cannot stay on same action; to repeat, move 8 spaces (pay 5 resources).
   - First turn: may choose any action freely.
3. **Perform Rondel Action**:
   - **Production (Marble, Iron, Gold)**: Gain 1 resource per matching city (3 if city has temple).
   - **Temple**: Spend 5 Marble to build a temple in a city you own (max 1 per city).
   - **Arming**: Spend 1 Iron to add a unit:
     - 1 unit per city without temple
     - 3 units per city with temple
     - Galleys only in sea-border provinces; legions only in land-border provinces.
   - **Know-How**: Spend Gold to learn advancements:
     - Basic: Wheel, Sailing, Market, Monarchy (cost: 6 if first, 3 if not)
     - Advanced: Roads, Navigation, Currency, Democracy (requires matching Basic; cost: 9 if first, 5 if not)
     - First to learn a Know-How gains a Scholar.
   - **Maneuver (x2 on rondel)**:
     - **Phase 1: Movement** – Move units across borders (legions: land; galleys: sea). Battles occur 1:1 if desired.
     - **Phase 2: Conquest** – Conquer a city if active units ≥ city defense strength.
4. **Found Cities** (optional):
   - Spend 1 Gold, 1 Iron, 1 Marble per city.
   - Must have at least 1 military unit in the province.
   - Foreign units do not block founding.
5. **Win Personalities** (automatic):
   - Check conditions at end of turn. Claim immediately if met and cards available.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Rondel Movement**: Forces progression; limits repetition unless costly.
- **Resource Production**:
  - Base: 1 per city of type
  - With temple: 3 per city
  - Market: +1 to production
  - Currency: +2 to production
- **Temple Effects**:
  - Triples production, arming, and defense in city.
  - Defense: +2 (from 1 to 3) if city has temple.
- **Military Movement**:
  - Base: 1 maneuver per unit
  - Wheel: Legions get 2 maneuvers
  - Roads: Legions get 3
  - Sailing: Galleys get 2
  - Navigation: Galleys get 3
- **Conquest**:
  - City defense = base (1 or 3) + defending units present + Monarchy (+1) or Democracy (+2).
  - Attacking units must have maneuvers remaining.
  - Defender loses city, temple, and all units.
- **Personality Acquisition**:
  - **Kings**: 1 per 5 cities
  - **Scholars**: 1 per new Know-How learned (first to learn)
  - **Generals**: 1 per temple destroyed (via conquest)
  - **Citizens**: 1 per 3 temples owned
  - **Navigators**: 1 per 7 seas controlled (province with own galley at turn end)

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Conditions**:
  - Standard: First to reach required number of personalities:
    - 6 nations: 7
    - 5 nations: 8
    - 4 nations: 9
    - 3 nations: 10 (or 12)
  - 2-Player Variant: First to **10 personalities** or **destroy opponent’s last city**.
  - Tiebreaker: If all 35 personalities are claimed with no winner, first to destroy a temple wins.
- **Scoring**:
  - Personalities are permanent; once acquired, never lost.
  - Score tracked via octagonal stones on board’s score track.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you trade?** No. Resources, units, or favors cannot be exchanged between players.
- **Can you transport legions over water?** No. Legions cannot cross sea borders; galleys required for sea movement.
- **Can legions and galleys fight each other?** No. Only same unit types battle. However, both can participate in city defense/conquest.
- **Can you attack without conquering?** No. Conquest requires explicit Phase 2 action.
- **Can a city be attacked more than once per turn?** No. Only one conquest attempt per turn.
- **What if bank runs out of resources?** Cannot produce or build if supply is exhausted (except coins: replace with resource if unavailable).
- **Can you conquer your own city?** No. Only foreign cities can be conquered.
- **Can you use a unit that moved to help conquer?** Only if it has maneuvers remaining. Units that used all maneuvers to move cannot participate in conquest.
- **What happens to a destroyed temple?** Returns to bank; any nation can rebuild it.
