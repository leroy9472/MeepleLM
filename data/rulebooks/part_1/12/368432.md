# The Fox Experiment – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 1958, Russian geneticists Dmitri Belyaev and Lyudmila Trut began an experiment to domesticate silver foxes by selectively breeding only the friendliest individuals each generation. Inspired by this real-world study, in *The Fox Experiment*, players simulate multiple generations of fox breeding over five rounds. The goal is to score the most points by:  
- Breeding foxes with high friendliness (trait symbols)  
- Completing scientific studies  
- Attracting patrons  
- Unlocking upgrades  
- Earning end-game rewards  

The game ends after the 5th round, and the player with the highest total score wins.

#### Phase 3: Research (Simultaneous)  
1. **Score Studies**:  
   - Assign **one pup** to **one study level**  
   - Pup must meet or exceed minimum marked spaces on required traits  
   - Levels must be completed **left to right**  
   - One pup = one level only  
   - Place/move fox meeple to completed level  
2. **Collect Trait Tokens**:  
   - For each trait, gain 1 token per marked circle **only from best fox in that trait**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I select a fox I made last round?**  
A: Yes, if it’s in the kennel and not taken by another player.

A: Yes. You can unlock upgrades **twice per round**: after Selection and after Research.

**Q: What happens if I can’t complete a study level this round?**  
A: Nothing. Studies can be completed over multiple rounds. Just keep trying.

**Q: Can I use a science card during another player’s pup breeding?**  
A: Yes. Science cards can be played at any legal time, even during others’ actions in simultaneous phases.

**Q: Do friendly tokens count toward supply scoring?**  
A: Yes. Counted with trait tokens: 1 pt per 2 total.

**Q: Can I unlock a patron upgrade if all patrons are taken?**  
A: Yes. You may place your meeple even if others are already there.
