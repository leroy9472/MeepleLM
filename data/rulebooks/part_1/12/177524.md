## ICECOOL — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In ICECOOL, players take on the roles of penguins in a school where one penguin serves as the Hall Monitor (Catcher) each round, tasked with catching the other penguins (Runners). The Runners attempt to collect fish tokens from doors marked with their color. The goal is to earn the most victory points by collecting fish cards (awarded for fish tokens and ID cards) over the course of the game. The game ends when every player has served as the Hall Monitor once (twice in 2-player games). The player with the highest total victory points wins.

2. Components  
- 4 Plastic Penguins (in 4 colors)  
- 16 Wooden Fish Tokens:  
  - 12 colored fish (3 per player)  
  - 4 White fish (used to connect rooms)  
- 5 Cardboard Room Boxes  
- 45 Fish Cards (worth 1, 2, or 3 victory points each)  
- 4 Color Reminder Cards (portrait cards)  
- 4 Penguin ID Cards  
- (Promo additions may include: Pawclaw, The Emperor, Honeycombs, Snowflakes, Emerald Fish, Walruses, Artifacts, Blocked Door, Portals, etc., depending on expansions used)

3. Setup  
a. Room Assembly:  
- Arrange the 5 room boxes so that the color dots at the bottom of doorways match.  
- Clip the 4 white fish tokens onto the designated white clip spots at the tops of walls to hold the structure together.  

b. Player Setup:  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 1 penguin  
  - 1 color reminder (portrait) card  
  - 1 ID card (except in Race mode)  
  - 3 fish tokens of their color  

c. Card Setup:  
- Shuffle the fish cards to form a face-down draw pile.  

d. First Hall Monitor:  
- The player who most recently saw a real penguin becomes the first Hall Monitor.  
- In games of 6+ players: the next player clockwise is also a Hall Monitor.  

e. Optional Promo Setup (if used):  
- Pc (Pawclaw): Place Pawclaw on the center room’s hockey table dot.  
- E (The Emperor): Place The Emperor on the same dot.  
- EF (Emerald Fish): Clip the emerald fish onto any door top.  
- W (Walruses): Stand 3 walruses in the centers of rooms 3, 4, and 5.  
- A (Artifacts): Lay out 4 artifacts (glowing side up); each player takes one clockwise starting with the Hall Monitor.  
- BD (Blocked Door): Hall Monitor slides the blocked door card between boxes to block a doorway.  
- P (Portals): Apply Portal stickers to designated wall/floor locations as per layout.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this sequence:

Phase 1: Round Setup  
- Runners: Attach one of their fish tokens to each of the three doors marked with a fish symbol (per layout).  
- Hall Monitor: Place their penguin anywhere within the red border in the Kitchen (room 2).  
- Promo Adjustments: Set up any active promo components (e.g., walruses, artifacts, blocked door).

Phase 2: Turn Order  
- Turns proceed clockwise, starting with the player to the left of the Hall Monitor.  
- In Race Mode (R): Players form 2-player teams; turns alternate between team members.  
- Each turn consists of one flick, unless extra turns are earned.

Turn Structure:  
a. First Turn (Runner): Place penguin on the red circle in the Classroom (room 1).  
b. Subsequent Turns: Flick penguin from its current position.  
c. Red Line Adjustment: If penguin is near a wall or stuck in a door, move it to the closest point on the red border before flicking. If visible in two rooms from above, choose which room’s red border to use.  
d. Flick: Use one of three techniques:  
  - Straight: Flick center of base.  
  - Curve: Flick side to curve in that direction.  
  - Jump: Flick head to jump over walls/doors.  

Events During/After Flick:  
- Runner through own fish door: Take fish token and draw 1 fish card (must fully pass through; jumping over doesn’t count).  
- Runner touches Hall Monitor (or vice versa): Hall Monitor takes Runner’s ID. Runner continues playing.  
- Runner stuck in door: Before next flick, place penguin on red line of visible room. Must fully pass through in one move to claim fish.  
- Penguin jumps out of bounds: Return to starting point of turn; turn ends (but may still use Ice Skates).  
- Another player’s flick moves your penguin: Effects still trigger (e.g., through door → take fish; into Catcher → lose ID).  

Optional Actions (during turn):  
- Ice Skates: At end of turn, flip two 1-point fish cards face up to take an extra turn. Cards remain in hand and count for points. Can chain multiple times.  
- Pc: Spend 1 honeycomb to flick Pawclaw instead; place honeycomb in adjacent box corner.  
- E: Spend 1 snowflake to draw a new card (tuck old under deck); spend 2 to flick again.  
- EF: Pass through emerald fish door → take it; touch penguin holding it → swap.  
- BD: Hit blocked door → may reroute to another doorway.  
- P: Touch a portal → after resolving fish/ID, place at other portal.  
- W: Knock over walrus → take another turn; stand walruses back up before next player.  
- A (Artifacts): Use once per round:  
  - Sundial: Reset turn and replay.  
  - Trap: Place in room; when another penguin touches it, you flick their penguin.  
  - Teleport: Place in room; move to it before/after turn, then remove.  
  - Platform: Place on T-wall junction adjacent to your room; start next turn from it.  

Phase 3: End of Round  
Round ends if:  
- Any Runner collects all 3 of their fish tokens.  
- Hall Monitor collects all ID cards.  
- (2p): Hall Monitor catches Runner twice.  
- (R): A team collects all 3 fish tokens and both penguins are in the finish room.  

End-of-Round Procedure:  
a. EF: Player holding emerald fish takes 1 Emerald Fish card (worth 3 points).  
b. Each player draws 1 fish card per ID they possess (including their own).  
c. Return all fish tokens and ID cards to owners for next round.  
d. New Hall Monitor: Player to the left (6p+: next two players clockwise).  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Movement: Flicking penguin; techniques affect trajectory.  
- Catching: Physical contact between Catcher and Runner exchanges ID.  
- Scoring Triggers:  
  - Collecting fish token → draw 1 fish card.  
  - Holding ID at round end → draw 1 fish card per ID.  
- Extra Turns:  
  - Ice Skates: Two 1-point cards → extra turn.  
  - W: Knock over walrus → extra turn.  
  - E: Spend 2 snowflakes → extra flick.  
- Special Conditions:  
  - Stuck in door: Move to red line, must fully pass through in one flick.  
  - Out of bounds: Return to start of turn; turn ends.  
  - Portals: Teleport between linked spots.  
  - Artifacts: One-time use per round.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when each player has been Hall Monitor once (twice in 2-player games).  
- Total Victory Points: Sum of all fish card values.  
- E Variant: Add 1 point per unspent snowflake.  
- Tournament Rules: Each fish = 1 point, each ID = 1 point; ignore point values on cards.  
- Tiebreakers:  
  - Standard: Most fish cards → if still tied, share victory.  
  - Tournament: Most victories → victory points → coefficient → pre-final ranking (if final tie).  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Does jumping over a fish door count?  
  A: No. Must fully pass through.  

- Q: What if my penguin rotates back into the door after passing through?  
  A: Still counts; take fish and card.  

- Q: Can I use Ice Skates after being pushed through a door by another player?  
  A: Yes, if you end your turn with two 1-point cards face up.  

- Q: Can I touch my penguin outside my turn?  
  A: Only to move it to the red line. Any other contact counts as a flick.  

- Q: What if my penguin is pushed into the Catcher during another player’s turn?  
  A: You lose your ID; Catcher gains it.  

- Q: Can I use an Artifact after using Ice Skates?  
  A: Yes, if it’s during your turn.  

- Q: In Race Mode, must both penguins be in the finish room to win?  
  A: Yes, and all team fish tokens collected.  

- Q: Do face-up fish cards count toward final card count for tiebreakers?  
  A: Yes; all cards in hand count, regardless of orientation.
