## SAIL: Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
SAIL is a cooperative trick-taking game for 2 players. You and your partner are sailors navigating treacherous waters, racing toward the safety of the End tile while evading the storm and battling the Kraken. Your success depends on strategic card play, careful coordination, and managing the ship’s progress and health.

**Objective**: Work together to move your ship from the Start tile to the End tile before the storm overtakes you or the Kraken destroys your vessel. Win by reaching the End tile. Lose if any of the loss conditions are met.

Each game consists of up to 5 rounds. A round ends when one player wins their 4th trick.

#### Round Structure:
1. **Deal**: Deal 9 cards to each player from the Player Deck.

3. **Action Phase (Trick Play)**:
   - The player with the Round Disc on their side leads the first trick.
   - Players alternate playing cards until one wins 4 tricks.
4. **End of Round**:
   - Kraken deals damage based on Meeple position.
   - Shuffle hands and discard into new Player Deck.
   - Advance Round Disc, reset Trick Cubes.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Trick Play  
- **Lead**: The player with the Round Disc closer to them leads the first trick. Subsequent tricks are led by the previous trick winner.
- **Following Suit**: The second player must follow suit (color) if able. Otherwise, may play any card.
- **Winning a Trick**: The highest card of the lead suit wins. Winner advances their Trick Cube by 1.
- **Discard**: Both cards are discarded after resolution.

#### Actions (from Card Combinations)  
When two cards form a matching symbol pair, perform the corresponding action immediately:

| Symbol Pair | Action |
|------------|-------|
| Wheel + Wheel | Move ship forward toward trick winner. |
| Wheel + Kraken | Move ship toward winner. Then Kraken damages ship once. |
| Wheel + Tentacle | Move ship toward winner. Then Kraken damages twice. |
| Wheel + Kraken Card | Place Kraken Card at bottom of Kraken Deck (damage Kraken). |
| Two Wheels of same value | Move ship straight forward 1 space (2 normal moves). |
| Cannon + Any | Trigger Cannon Action sequence. |

#### Cannon Actions (triggered by Cannon + Any combo):  
Reveal and resolve the top card of the Player Deck:
1. Move ship toward trick winner.
2. Place revealed card at bottom of Kraken Deck.
3. Move ship straight forward 1 space.
4. Flip another card (repeat steps 1–4 if it’s a Cannon).

> If Player Deck is empty, skip flip.

#### Kraken Damage  
- For each damage instance:
  - Remove top card from Kraken Deck to discard pile.
  - **Exception**: If top card is the Kraken Card:
    - Move Kraken Meeple one space clockwise on track.
    - Place Kraken Card at bottom of Kraken Deck.
- If Kraken Meeple reaches final space ("Dead"), you lose.
- If Kraken Card is the only card in the deck, you lose.

#### Movement Rules (Map Features)  
- **Islands**: Ship cannot enter. Movement fails.
- **Kraken Spaces**: After moving in, Kraken damages ship once.
- **Edge of Board**: Movement off edge fails.
- **Whirlpool (Expansion)**: Move again in same direction.
- **Amy Slip (Expansion)**: Move any discard to bottom of Kraken Deck.
- **Crow’s Nest (Expansion)**: Exchange one card with partner immediately.

#### Pirate Abilities (Base Game)  
- **Orange Wheel Pirate**: Must win trick containing an Orange Wheel (Grey 6, 7, or 8).
- **Cannon, Reveal 2**: Double card draw from Cannon Action also applies when drawing a Cannon via Cannon Action.
- **Two Tentacle/Wheels of Same Value**: “Instead” only applies to movement; damage still occurs.

#### Pirate Abilities (Expansion)  
- **Send Cards to Kraken Deck**: After Exchange Phase, send a card to bottom of Kraken Deck.
- **Cannon+Wheel Action**: Available to both players; trick winner takes the card.
- **Two Exchange Phases**: Both players exchange twice before trick play.

> Unless stated, abilities only apply to the owning player. Abilities triggered by winning a trick only activate if the winner has the relevant Pirate Card.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Win Condition  
- **Immediate Win**: Ship reaches the End tile.

#### Lose Conditions (Immediate Loss)  
- End of Round 5 and ship hasn’t reached End.
- Start of Round 3 and ship not past first storm (column 5 or as per scenario).
- Start of Round 5 and ship not past second storm (if applicable).
- Kraken Card is the only card in the Kraken Deck.
- Kraken Meeple reaches final space ("Dead").
- A single action causes both win and loss → **you win**.

> Storms are vertical columns. To "pass" a storm, the ship must be fully to the right of the storm column.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I look at the discard or Kraken Deck?**  
  Yes. All card information is open.

- **What happens if a movement would trigger multiple effects?**  
  Resolve in order: movement → island/edge check → Kraken/Whirlpool/Crow’s Nest/Amy Slip.

- **Do I move if I trigger a Wheel+Kraken action but land on an island?**  
  No. Movement fails due to island, but **Kraken still damages**.

- **Can I use Pirate abilities during the Exchange Phase?**  
  Only if the ability allows it (e.g., Expansion Pirate with two exchanges).

- **What if the Player Deck runs out during a Cannon Action chain?**  
  Stop when no more cards to flip. No further effects.

- **Does "Move straight forward" count as two moves?**  
  Yes. It advances the ship two spaces forward (same column).

- **Are expansions required?**  
  No. Base game uses simpler scenarios. Expansion pirates and maps increase difficulty and options.
