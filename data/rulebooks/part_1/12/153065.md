## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In **Linko!** (also known as *Abluxxen*), players compete to shed their hand while collecting and protecting cards in front of them. The goal is to maximize victory points (VP) by playing as many cards as possible to your stack and minimizing the number of cards left in your hand when the game ends.

### 2. Components  
- 104 number cards: 8 suits, each numbered 1–13  
- 5 joker ("X") wild cards  
- 1 Linko card (optional, used to track turn order)  
- Total: 110 cards  

### 3. Setup  
1. Shuffle the deck and deal **13 cards** to each player.  
2. Place the remaining deck in the center as the **draw pile**.  
3. Reveal the top **6 cards** of the draw pile to form a **card row** (face-up market).  
4. Place a discard pile area to the left of the draw pile.  
5. (Optional) Place the **Linko card** in front of the starting player (youngest player, or determined otherwise).  

> **Duel Variant Setup (2 players only):**  
> - Each player receives **11 cards + 2 jokers**.  
> - A **ghost player** is dealt 13 cards, displayed face-up.  
> - All 13s and jokers from the ghost’s hand are moved to the card row, paired with existing cards.  
> - Replenish the ghost’s hand to 13 cards; repeat if more 13s/jokers appear.  
> - The ghost never takes turns or snatches cards.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds clockwise. On your turn:

1. **Play Cards**:  
   - Play **1 or more cards** of the **same number** face-up in front of you, forming a stack.  
   - Cards are splayed so all played cards remain visible.  
   - New sets are placed **on top** of previous ones, forming layered stacks.  
   - **Jokers ("X")** are wild:  
     - When played with number cards, they take that number.  
     - When played alone or with other jokers, they count as **value 14**.

2. **Compare and Snatch (Clockwise, Starting Left):**  
   For each opponent (and ghost in Duel), check the **topmost layer** of their stack:  
   - If you played the **same number of cards** AND your card value is **higher**, you **must snatch**.  
   - Snatching is **compulsory** when conditions are met.  
   - You may snatch from **multiple opponents**, but **only once per player per turn**.  
   - Process snatches **in clockwise order**, starting with the player to your left.  
     - In **Duel**, snatching from the **ghost occurs first**, then the opponent.

3. **Snatching Resolution (Per Opponent):**  
   When you snatch an opponent’s top layer:  
   - **Option A**: Take their cards into **your hand**.  
     - The opponent **draws an equal number** of cards (from draw pile or card row).  
   - **Option B**: Let the opponent choose:  
     - (i) Take the snatched cards **back into their hand**, OR  
     - (ii) **Discard** them and draw an equal number of replacement cards.  
   - **Important**: Snatched cards **cannot stay in the stack** — they must be moved.  
   - In **Duel**, if snatching from the **ghost**, you **must take the cards** — no choice.

4. **Drawing and Replenishing:**  
   - Players may draw from either the **draw pile** or **card row**.  
   - After a player finishes drawing all required cards, **replenish the card row** to 6 cards from the draw pile (if possible).

5. **End of Turn:**  
   - Once all snatching is complete, your turn ends.  
   - Pass the turn to the next player clockwise (move Linko card if used).

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Stacks**: Players build stacks in front of them. Only the **topmost layer** (most recent play) is relevant for snatching.  
- **Snatching Conditions**:  
  - Same number of cards played  
  - Higher card value  
  - Checked **once per opponent per turn**, in clockwise order  
- **Wild Cards ("X"/Jokers)**:  
  - Value 14 when played alone or in a group of Xs  
  - Match any number when played in a set with number cards  
- **Card Row (Market)**:  
  - 6 face-up cards available for drawing  
  - Replenished **only after** a player finishes drawing  
  - In Duel: Taking a **card pair** from the row counts as drawing **one card**

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Triggers (Immediate):**  
- A player plays their **last card** (empties their hand), OR  
- The **draw pile is empty** AND the **card row has fewer than 6 cards** (i.e., cannot be replenished)  

> **Note**: In Duel, the ghost is replenished even if the game ends mid-turn — as long as the pile allows.

**Scoring:**  
- **+1 VP** for each card **played in your stack**  
- **–1 VP** for each card **remaining in your hand**  
- Card values do **not** affect scoring — only count.  

**Winning:**  
- The player with the **most VP wins**.  
- In case of a tie, **all tied players win**.  
- For multi-round games: Track scores per round; highest total after all rounds wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you snatch with a single card?**  
  Yes — as long as the opponent has a single card on top and yours is higher.  
- **Can you snatch your own cards?**  
  No — only other players (or ghost in Duel).  
- **Can you play different numbers in one turn?**  
  No — all cards played must be the **same number**.  
- **What happens if multiple snatches occur?**  
  Resolve each in **clockwise order**. The active player chooses whether to take each set.  
- **Can a player be snatched twice in one turn?**  
  No — only the **top layer** is checked, and only **once per player**.  
- **When does the card row get replenished?**  
  Only **after** a player finishes **all drawing** (from row or draw pile).  
- **What happens if the draw pile runs out during a snatch?**  
  The game ends **immediately** after the current turn finishes (or mid-turn if no cards left to draw).  
- **In Duel: Do you have to snatch from the ghost if able?**  
  Yes — and you **must take the cards** into your hand.  
- **Can you discard your own cards?**  
  No — only as a result of being snatched and choosing to discard.
