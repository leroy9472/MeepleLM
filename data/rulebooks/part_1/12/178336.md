     - 4 players: 13 spaces  
     - 3 players: 11 spaces  
     - 2 players: 9 spaces  
2. **Arrange Area Tiles**: Place the 5 area tiles randomly around the central board to form a hexagon.  
3. **Place Markers**:  
   - Ferris wheel car on the start space (⊙) at the bottom of the Ferris wheel.  
   - Round marker on the far left of the round track (start of Round 1).  
4. **Prepare Draw Deck**:  
   - Shuffle all 91 cards (main exhibits, midway tickets, influential figures) into one deck.  
   - Remove cards based on player count:  
     - 2 players: Remove 1 midway ticket and 1 main exhibit from each of the 5 categories (6 total).  
     - 4 players: Remove 5 midway tickets, 2 Daniel Burnham, 1 George Davis, and 1 Bertha Palmer cards (9 total).

7. **Assign Start Player & Bonus Cards**:  
   - Randomly choose the first player.  
   - Give each player the start bonus card matching their turn order (Player 1, Player 2, etc.).  
   - Each player performs the action(s) on their card.  
8. **Select Scoring Reference Cards**: Use the two that match the number of players. Return the others to the box.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game is played over three rounds, each ending with a scoring phase triggered when the Ferris wheel car completes a full rotation. Players take turns in clockwise order.

**On your turn:**  
1. Place a supporter  
2. Play influential figures (if any)  
3. Collect cards from the area  
4. Add three new cards to the board  

After your turn, if the Ferris wheel car stopped at the start space, a **Scoring Phase** occurs before the next player’s turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Step 1: Place a Supporter  
- Choose any area and place one of your supporters there.  
- If you have no supporters in your supply, you may remove one from any area to use.

#### Step 2: Play Influential Figures  
- If you collected influential figure cards on your previous turn, you must play or discard them now, in any order.  
- You cannot save them for later turns.  
- Actions:  
  - **Daniel Burnham**: Add 1 supporter to the same area where you just placed.  
  - **George Davis**: Add 1 supporter to an adjacent area (areas on either side of the base are not adjacent).  
  - **Bertha Palmer**: Move any one supporter (yours or an opponent’s) from any area to any other area.  
  - **Cyrus McCormick, Charles H. Schwab, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, George Westinghouse, George Pullman**: Add 1 supporter to the area indicated on the card.

#### Step 3: Collect Cards  
- Take all face-up cards from the area where you placed your supporter.  
- Cards are placed face up in front of you (visible to all).  
- For each **midway ticket** collected, move the Ferris wheel car forward one space.  
  - If it lands on the start space (⊙), it stops. This triggers a **Scoring Phase** at the end of your turn.  
  - It does **not** skip over the start space.  
- You **only** collect cards from the area where you placed your supporter.  
- Influential figures may let you add supporters elsewhere, but you do **not** collect cards from those areas.

#### Step 4: Add Three New Cards  
- Add 1 card from the draw deck to the area where you placed your supporter.  
- Then add 1 card to each of the next two **available** areas in clockwise order.  
  - An area is "available" if it has fewer cards than its capacity (marked by arrows: 3↓ or 4↕).  
  - If an area is full, skip it and continue clockwise.  
- If the draw deck runs out, reshuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Scoring Phase (Triggered 3 Times)  
Occurs when the Ferris wheel car stops at the start space. It happens after the current player’s turn and before the next player’s turn.

**Step 1: Redeem Midway Tickets**  
- **Leader Bonus**: The player with the most midway tickets gains 2 points (in midway coins). If tied, all tied players gain 2.  
- **Redeem Tickets**: All players gain 1 point per midway ticket.  
- Discard all redeemed tickets.

**Step 2: Score Areas**  
Score each of the 5 areas one at a time, starting with the area to the left of the base and proceeding clockwise.

- **Leader Medals**: Awarded based on supporter majority:  
  - 1st place (most supporters): gains a leader medal (2 or 4 points, per reference card).  
  - 2nd place (only in 3–4 player games): gains a leader medal (if applicable per reference card).  
  - Ties:  
    - Tie for 1st: All tied players gain a medal and can approve exhibits. No 2nd place is awarded.  
    - Tie for 2nd (4 players only): Players may approve 1 exhibit but do **not** gain a medal.  
- **Approve Exhibits**:  
  - 1st place: Can approve up to 3 matching main exhibit cards (discard card, gain approval token).  
  - 2nd place: Can approve 1 matching card (if applicable).  
  - Only main exhibit cards matching the area’s category can be approved.  
  - Use the scoring reference card for exact numbers based on player count.

**Step 3: Recall Supporters**  
- For every **pair** of supporters you have in an area, remove one (round down).  
  - Example: 5 supporters → recall 2; 6 → recall 3; 1 → recall 0.  
- Move the round marker forward one space on the track.

After the first two scoring phases, begin the next round. After the third, proceed to end game.

#### End of Game  
After the third scoring phase, the game ends. Players total their points:

1. **Midway Coins**: Each is worth its face value (1 or 2 points).  
2. **Leader Medals**: Each is worth its printed value (2 or 4 points).  
3. **Approved Exhibit Tokens**:  
   - Group tokens into sets of unique categories (one per category per set).  
   - Score per set:  
     - 1 token: 1 point  
     - 2 unique: 3 points  
     - 3 unique: 6 points  
     - 4 unique: 10 points  
     - 5 unique: 15 points  
   - Unapproved main exhibit cards are worth 0 points.

**Winning**:  
- Highest total score wins.  
- Tiebreaker order:  
  1. Most approved exhibit tokens  
  2. Fewest unapproved main exhibit cards  
  3. Shared victory
