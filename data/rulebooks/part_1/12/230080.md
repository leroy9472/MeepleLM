### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Majesty: For the Realm*, players compete to build the wealthiest realm by enlisting citizens with unique abilities. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) through strategic character placement, resource management, and interaction with opponents. The game ends when each player has 12 Character Cards in their realm, after which final scoring determines the winner.

### 2. Components
- 8 Location Cards per player (Mill, Brewery, Cottage, Guard-House, Barracks, Inn, Castle, Infirmary), each with A and B sides
- Character Cards: Tier 1 (green backs), Tier 2 (red backs), including split cards representing two characters
- Worker Cards (one per player) with meeple storage slots
- Meepees (worker tokens)
- Coin/Point chips: copper (1), silver (2), gold (10), gems (50), and high-value tokens (dagger, goblet, ring, circlet = 100 each)
- Optional: 16-card Young Suitor deck for solo mode

### 3. Setup
1. **Location Cards**: Each player takes one of each of the 8 Location Cards and arranges them in numerical order, A-side up, in front of them.
2. **First Player**: Shuffle a number of Worker Cards equal to the number of players (including the knight card), deal one face down to each player. Reveal; the player with the knight is first. Place Worker Card next to realm.
3. **Meepees**: Each player places 5 meepees on their Worker Card. Remaining meepees form a general supply.
4. **Coins**: Form a shared supply of all coin types.
5. **Character Deck**:
   - Shuffle Tier 2 Character Cards (red backs) into a face-down deck.
   - Shuffle Tier 1 Character Cards (green backs), then remove:
     - 2P: 6 cards
     - 3P: 14 cards
     - 4P: 26 cards
   - Place removed cards on top of Tier 2 deck.
   - Place Tier 1 deck on top to form full deck.
6. **Display**: Reveal top 6 cards of the deck into a face-up display row. Keep meepees on cards if present.

*Optional Variants*:
- **B-Sides**: Flip all Location Cards to B-side during setup.
- **Mixed Sides**: All players use identical mix of A and B sides.
- **Full Deck**: Shuffle Tier 1 and Tier 2 together without removing any cards.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise starting with the first player. On a turn:

1. **Draft a Character**:
   - Choose any face-up Character Card from the display.
   - If selecting a card not in the front position, place 1 meeple on each card skipped (from front to just before selected).
   - Cannot draft a card if insufficient meepees to pay for skipped cards.
   - Gain all meepees on the selected card: place on Worker Card if space; any overflow placed next to it.

2. **Place and Activate**:
   - Place the drafted Character Card under its matching Location (e.g., Miller → Mill).
   - For split cards (e.g., Brewer/Witch), choose which character to use and place accordingly.
   - Activate the Location’s abilities in order (top to bottom), resolving fully before moving on.

3. **End of Turn**:
   - Any meepees adjacent to Worker Card are returned to supply; gain 1 VP per meepee returned.
   - Slide remaining display cards left to fill gap.
   - Draw a new card from the deck to refill the back position (rightmost). Keep meepees on cards.

Play continues until all players have exactly 12 Character Cards (including those in Infirmary).

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Location Activation (A-Side)
- **Mill**: Gain 2 VP per Miller.
- **Brewery**: Gain 2 VP and 1 meeple per Brewer. Then, announce: all players (including self) with ≥1 Miller gain 2 VP.
- **Cottage**: Heal top card from Infirmary (return face up to matching Location; no activation). Then gain 2 VP per Miller, Brewer, and Witch.
- **Guard-House**: Gain 2 VP per Guard, Soldier (Knight), and Innkeeper. Guards defend against attacks.
- **Barracks**: 
  - Attack: For each opponent, compare your Knights vs their Guards. If you have more, opponent moves leftmost Character to Infirmary (face down). Only one card per opponent.
  - Then gain 3 VP per Knight.
- **Inn**: Gain 4 VP per Innkeeper. Then announce: all players (including self) with ≥1 Brewer gain 3 VP.
- **Castle**: Gain 5 VP and 1 meeple per Noble.
- **Infirmary**: Stores wounded characters. No activation. At game end: lose 1 VP per card.

#### Location Activation (B-Side)
- **Brewery**: Gain 1 meeple per Miller and Brewer. If you have ≥1 Innkeeper **and** ≥1 Noble, gain 10 VP (once only).
- **Inn**: Identify the Character type you have most of. Gain 2 VP per character of that type. (If tie, pick one; score based on Innkeepers × 2 × count.)
- **Castle**: 
  - May convert up to 5 times: 1 meeple ↔ 1 VP (either direction).
  - Then gain 4 VP per Noble **and** per character in your Infirmary.
- **Infirmary**: At game end: lose 2 VP per card. If you have the most cards in Infirmary, lose 10 VP (all tied players lose 10 VP).

#### Special Rules
- **Infirmary**:
  - Cards placed face down, leftmost character first.
  - Order cannot be changed; cards not counted for activations.
  - Healing returns top card to its Location without activating that Location.
- **Split Cards**: When healed, player chooses which side to use.
- **All-Player Effects** (black "all" icon): Trigger other players to gain VP based on their own realms.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends when all players have 12 Character Cards (in realm or Infirmary). Final scoring:

1. **Infirmary Penalty**:
   - A-Side: Lose 1 VP per card in Infirmary.
   - B-Side: Lose 2 VP per card. Additionally, lose 10 VP if you have the most cards in Infirmary (all tied players lose 10 VP).

2. **Variety Bonus**:
   - Count number of Locations with ≥1 character.
   - Score = (number)² VP.

3. **Majority Bonuses**:
   - For each Location, compare player totals in that Location.
   - Player(s) with most characters gain the VP shown on the bottom-right of the Location Card.
   - In case of tie, all tied players gain the full amount.

**Winning**: Player with most VP wins. Tie = shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I attack myself?** No. Barracks attack targets all *other* players.
- **Do Infirmary characters count for activations?** No. Only active (face-up) characters count.
- **Can I heal a split card and choose where to place it?** Yes. Player chooses which half to use.
- **Do I gain VP for meepees returned at end of turn?** Yes. 1 VP per meepee returned from overflow.
- **What if display runs out of cards?** Refill after each turn; deck is large enough to last.
- **Can I skip a turn?** No. Must draft a card if able. If unable to afford any card, must pass? → Not specified; assumed you can always take front card (free).
- **Can I place meepees on display even if I don’t take a card?** No. Only as cost to draft.
- **Can I heal even if Cottage has no Witch?** Yes. Any character placed at Cottage triggers healing (A-side).
- **Do All-Player effects trigger on opponent turns?** Yes. If you have Brewers, you gain VP when someone activates Brewery.
