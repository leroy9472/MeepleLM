## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Players are competing corporations working to terraform Mars by raising temperature, increasing oxygen levels, and placing ocean tiles. The goal is to be the most successful corporation by earning the most Victory Points (VP) through terraforming, milestones, awards, and card effects. The game ends when two of the three global parameters (oxygen, temperature, oceans) are complete. The player with the highest VP wins.

2. **Components**  
- Game board (with oxygen, temperature, and VP tracks)  
- 7 Ocean tiles  
- Transparent tracking cubes (for oxygen and temperature)  
- Player cubes (for VP tracking)  
- Dice pool: Colored dice (yellow, red, blue, green, grey) representing resources  
- Wild tokens  
- Project cards (green, red, blue)  
- Corporation cards  
- Milestone tiles  
- Bonus cards  
- Award dice (placed on board during setup)

3. **Setup**  
- Place the board in the center.  
- Place tracking cubes at 0% oxygen and -32°C.  
- Stack 7 Ocean tiles on their board icon.  
- Each player chooses a color, places their VP cube at 0 on the VP track.  
- Place all dice and wild tokens near the board (dice pool).  
- Shuffle Project cards and place face down as a draw deck; place discard pile nearby.  
- Shuffle Bonus cards and place a face-down stack:  
  - 1–2 players: 4 cards  
  - 3 players: 6 cards  
  - 4 players: 8 cards  
- Randomly select 3 milestone tiles and place them on the board.  
- Roll 3 different-colored dice and place them on the Award spots.  
- Deal 5 Project cards to each player.  
- Deal 2 Corporation cards to each player; each chooses one, returns the other.  
- In player order:  
  - Reveal Corporation card  
  - Gain starting bonus (red box)  
  - Take and roll dice shown in brown production box  
- First player gives one of their resource dice to the last player (first-player penalty).

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
- Play proceeds clockwise.  
- On your turn, choose **one** of the following:  
  - **Production Turn**  
  - **Action Turn**  
- After all players complete their final turn when the end condition is triggered, proceed to scoring.

5. **Core Mechanics**  

**Production Turn**  
1. Keep up to 3 of your current resource dice (return the rest to the pool).  
2. Discard any number of cards from hand.  
3. Draw cards until you have 5 in hand.  
4. Take and roll all dice shown in the brown boxes of your Corporation and played green cards.  
   - If dice are unavailable in the pool, take as many as possible and gain **1 wild token** (regardless of deficit).  
5. Flip back all used blue cards (they are now available for use again).

**Action Turn**  
Consists of **1 Support Action** followed by **1 Main Action** (order matters).  

*Support Action (choose one):*  
- Gain and roll 1 die of your choice from the dice pool.  
- Discard 1 resource die to change the face of another die (rotate to any side).  
- Discard 1 resource die to draw 2 Project cards.  
- Use a support action on an unused blue card (then rotate it sideways to mark as used).

*Main Action (choose one):*  
- Play a card from your hand (pay exact cost in resources).  
- Use a main action on an unused blue card (pay cost if any, then rotate sideways).  
- Perform a second support action.  
- Standard Actions:  
  - Pay 3 heat (red) → Raise temperature 1 step, gain 2 VP (1 VP if temperature is complete).  
  - Pay 3 water (blue) → Place an ocean tile on a blue hex, gain 2 VP (1 VP if oceans are complete).  
  - Pay 4 plant (green) → Place a forest tile on any non-ocean hex.  
    - Gain 1 VP per adjacent city tile.  
    - Raise oxygen 1 step, gain 2 VP (1 VP if oxygen is complete).  
  - Pay 3 city (grey) → Place a city tile on a non-adjacent-to-city hex.  
    - Gain 2 VP + 1 VP per adjacent forest tile.  
  - Pay 3 credit (yellow) → Gain 2 VP.

*Free Actions:*  
- Some blue cards have green-arrow actions that can be used **at any time** during your turn.  
- After use, rotate the card sideways.  
- Blue cards are reset (flipped back) during your next Production Turn.

**Tile Placement Rules**  
- **Ocean**: On blue hexes only. Gain 2 VP (1 VP if complete).  
- **Forest (Greenery)**: On any empty non-ocean hex.  
  - Gain 1 VP per adjacent city.  
  - Raise oxygen 1 step, gain 2 VP (1 VP if complete).  
- **City**: Cannot be adjacent to another city.  
  - Gain 2 VP + 1 VP per adjacent forest.  
- **Special (Brown) Tiles**: Place on matching symbol hex; gain hex bonus.

**Bonus & Milestone Triggers**  
- **Bonus Cards**: When your VP reaches 5 or 12, **at the end of your turn**, secretly view the bonus stack, choose one, play it immediately for free (no dice gain until next Production), return others face down.  
- **Parameter Bonuses**:  
  - Oxygen: Bonuses at 4% and 10%.  
  - Temperature: Bonuses at -24°C, -16°C, and 0°C.  
- **Milestones**: First player to meet a requirement gains the tile immediately (worth 4 VP at game end). Examples:  
  - Legend: 6 red cards  
  - Monopoly: 7 dice of same color  
  - Scientist: 3 blue cards  
  - Terraformer: 16 VP  
  - (See full list in source)

**Dice & Resources**  
- 5 colors: yellow (credits), red (heat), blue (water), green (plants), grey (city/steel/titanium).  
- Each die has:  
  - 3 common faces (50%)  
  - 2 uncommon (33%)  
  - 1 rare (17%)  
- Icons:  
  - ? in die: any resource of that color  
  - White ? : any resource of any color  
  - White die: any color die  
  - Pink arrows around die: rotate one die to any face  
  - Red border with – : opponents lose 1 of that resource (if able)  
- Wild tokens: Spend as any resource.  
- If dice unavailable during production: gain 1 wild token (max 1 per turn).

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
**Trigger**: Game ends when **2 of 3 global parameters** are complete (oxygen = 14%, temperature = 8°C, oceans = 7 tiles).  
- All players (including the one who triggered it) get **one final turn**.  
- After final turns:  
  1. Discard all resources and cards in hand.  
  2. Score final VP:  
     - **Milestones**: 4 VP per tile.  
     - **Awards**: For each of the 3 award icons:  
       - Most: 5 VP  
       - Second most: 3 VP  
       - Tie for first: all tied get 5 VP, no second place  
       - Tie for second: all tied get 3 VP  
       - In 2-player: no second-place VP  
     - **Cards**: Sum all red-ribbon VP symbols on played cards.  
     - Terraforming VP (already gained during game) is included in final total.  
- **Tiebreaker**:  
  1. Highest production (sum of all dice icons in brown boxes on corporation and green cards).  
  2. If still tied, shared victory (or re-match).
