### 3. Setup  
**Standard Game (2–5 Players):**  
1. Remove Broken Tablet and Broken Pendant cards for 2–3 players; remove only Broken Pendant for 4 players. Use all for 5 players.  
2. Deal 1 Tent card to each player.  
3. Shuffle remaining treasure cards.  
4. Deal 4 treasure cards face-down to each player.  
5. Place 5 treasure cards face-up in the center as the Marketplace.  
6. Choose one monument tile and set up chambers as per its instructions.  
7. Shuffle the appropriate number of Map, Sandstorm, and Thief cards into the deck:  
   - 2 players: 6 Maps, 2 Sandstorms, 2 Thieves  
   - 3 players: 6 Maps, 3 Sandstorms, 3 Thieves  
   - 4 players: 6 Maps, 4 Sandstorms, 4 Thieves  
   - 5 players: 6 Maps, 5 Sandstorms, 5 Thieves  
8. Place deck face-down as the dig site.  
9. Determine starting player (e.g., lowest total hand value).

**Optional Variant Setups (See below for details):**  
- **Gold Coin Tokens (GCT):** Give each player 1 or 2 GCT at start (varies by sub-variant).  
- **Explorers Expansion:** Shuffle Explorer role cards, deal 2 to each player, choose 1 to keep.  
- **Ancient Artifacts:** Shuffle 4 face-up above marketplace; if Papyrus is among them, place rest face-down as a stack.  
- **Market Goal Cards:** Place (number of players +1) goal cards face-up.  
- **Solo Mode:** Start with 8 cards; only 2 Maps in deck; use "Buried Ruins" monument.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn:  
1. **Draw Phase (Dig for Treasure):**  
   - Draw top card of deck.  
   - **Treasure:** Add to hand.  
   - **Thief:** Reveal, discard, steal 1 random card from any opponent. Then draw again.  
   - **Sandstorm:** Reveal, discard. All players discard half their hand (round down) to marketplace. Tent may be discarded to avoid effect. Then draw again.  
   - Repeat until a treasure or thief is drawn.

2. **Action Phase (Any Order, Monument Once):**  
   - **Trade at Marketplace:** Exchange cards 1:1 by value (top number). May trade any number of cards.  
   - **Explore Monument:** Discard required number of Map cards (per chamber). Take all cards from one chamber into hand.  
   - **Sell to Museum:** Lay down complete sets of matching treasures (e.g., 3 Pot Shards). Scoring based on bottom chart. Cannot add to previous sets. Multiple sets of same type allowed.  
   - **Optional Variant Actions (if in play):**  
     - Invoke 1 Ancient Artifact per turn (cost ≥3 value in cards or GCT).  
     - Use Explorer abilities (e.g., Merchant swap, Professor add from market).  
     - Use GCT to trade, ship goods, or pay gatekeeper.  
     - Use Nomad ability to collect discarded sandstorm cards.  

3. **End of Turn:**  
   - Resolve any end-of-turn effects (e.g., Variant 1: add card to market after selling).  
   - Next player takes turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Trading:** Equal value exchange at marketplace. Value = top number on card.  
- **Selling Sets:** Score points based on number of cards in set (per bottom chart). Only one score per set.  
- **Sandstorm:** Discard half hand (round down). Tent negates once per storm. Discarded cards go to market (except in solo mode).  
- **Thief:** Steal one random card from opponent.  
- **Monument Exploration:** Requires Map cards. Chamber contents taken into hand.  
- **Winning Ties:** Most money wins. Tiebreaker: player with fewest total cards sold.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger:**  
- Deck is empty AND all players pass consecutively (i.e., skip drawing/selling).  
- First player who passed must then sell at least one set.  
- Game ends when all players have no cards in hand.

**Scoring:**  
- Score each complete set using the “Selling Chart” (bottom of cards).  
- **Optional Additions (if variants used):**  
  - **GCT:** Each remaining Gold Coin Token = $1 (1 VP).  
  - **Market Goal Cards:** Completed goals scored as indicated (e.g., 5 points).  
  - **Pot Shard/Parchment Expert (Variant 8):** Red/White meeple = 10 points to player with most cards of that type.  
  - **Entombed Cards (Pharaoh):** Can form new sets at end game.  
  - **Ancient Scroll (Artifact):** Can add cards to already sold sets.

**Final Score =**  
Sum of:  
- All sold sets  
- GCT tokens  
- Goal cards  
- Expert meeples  
- Any other scored bonuses

Highest total wins. Tiebreaker: fewest total cards sold.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I sell a single card?** Yes. It scores based on the 1-card value.  
- **Can I have multiple sets of the same type?** Yes, but cannot combine into one.  
- **Can I trade with zero-value cards?** No. All trades must match value.  
- **What if the deck runs out during a draw?** Stop drawing. Continue with actions.  
- **Can I use multiple Explorer powers in one turn?** Only one per turn unless specified (e.g., Pharaoh can entomb once per turn).  
- **What happens to invoked Artifacts?** Turn face-down. When all 4 are down, flip all face-up at end of turn.  
- **Can I invoke an Artifact without doing anything else?** Yes, as long as cost is paid.  
- **Solo Mode Win Condition:** Expose 5 of 6 treasure types in private collection before deck runs out.  
- **GCT Usage:** Can be used to pay for trades, gatekeeper, insurance, or monument access. Public information.  
- **Jaffer the Banker:** Source of GCT via card trades. Only gives GCT, never receives. GCT from shipping comes from bank, not Jaffer.
