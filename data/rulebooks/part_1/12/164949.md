# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In *Time of Crisis*, players represent heads of powerful Roman families during the turbulent 3rd century AD. The objective is to amass legacy points by gaining control of provinces, becoming Emperor, defeating enemies, and managing political influence. Victory is achieved by ending the game as Emperor with at least 60 legacy (or 40 in the short game), followed by bonus legacy based on turns spent as Emperor. The player with the most legacy wins.

## 2. Components
- Game board depicting the Roman Empire
- 6 six-sided dice
- 4 player mats
- Counters: 33 Roman Legions, 24 Generals, 32 Governors, 12 Militia, 50 Barbarians (5 tribes), 36 Improvements (12 each of Basilica, Limes, Amphitheater), 64 markers (Castra, Quaestor, Mob, Seat of Power/Breakaway, No Place Governor, First Player)

## 3. Setup
### 3.1 Game Setup
- Place board in center. Each player takes all components in one color (6 Governors, 6 Generals, 6 Seat of Power/Breakaway, 1 Legacy, 1 Emperor Turns), places Legacy and Emperor Turns at 0 on score track, and sets other counters nearby.
- Create a starting deck: 3 Red 1, 3 Blue 1, 3 Yellow 1 cards. Place in Available Pile. Unused 1-value cards go back to box.
- Place remaining Influence cards in face-up stacks by value and color beside board.
- Place Improvement counters in face-up stacks.
- Sort Barbarians by tribe and place all inactive in their homelands.
- Place Diocletian event card at bottom of shuffled Event deck (shuffled with top 3 events).

### 3.2 Player Setup
- Randomly determine first player; place First Player marker.
- Starting with first player and proceeding clockwise, each selects a starting province (not Italia).
- Place starting Governor in 1 space on support track, and starting General with 1 full-strength Legion and 1 Militia in provincial capital.
- Place Neutral Governors in 1 space of all unselected provinces. Set Italia support to 8 (number of Neutral-governed provinces).
- Each player secretly selects 5 cards from Available Pile to form starting hand.

### 3.3 Player Count Variants
- **Three Players**: Place No Place Governor markers on Hispania, Africa, Aegyptus. Do not place Neutral Governors there. Use 3-player Crisis Table. Remove Nomads. Italia starts at support 6.
- **Two Players**: Place No Place Governor markers on Britannia, Hispania, Africa, Aegyptus, Syria, Galatia. Do not place Neutral Governors. Use 2-player Crisis Table. Remove Nomads and Sassanids. Italia starts at support 4.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of 8 phases per player, in order:
1. **Upkeep**: Remove all Quaestor and Castra markers.
2. **Crisis**: Roll 2d6 on Crisis Table and resolve.
3. **Take Actions**: Play cards to generate influence and perform actions.
4. **Support Check**: Reduce support for troubled provinces and remove Governors if support ≤ 0 or Mobs ≥ support.
5. **Expand Pretender Empire**: Pretenders add Breakaway markers to eligible adjacent provinces.
6. **Gain Legacy**: Score legacy based on provinces, improvements, and status (Emperor/Pretender).
7. **Buy/Trash Cards**: Spend political points (support minus Mobs) to buy/trash cards.
8. **End of Turn**: Add Mobs, flip inactive barbarians to active, refill hand to 5.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Influence & Actions
- Play cards to generate Military (Red), Senate (Blue), Populace (Yellow) influence.
- Influence can be spent in any order. Unused influence is lost at turn end.
- Events on cards may be used at any point during turn.

#### Military Actions
- **Recruit General**: Spend Military = General’s cost. Place in Available Leaders.
- **Add Legion to Army**: Spend Military = number of Legions after addition. Army must have General and be in governed province.
- **Create Army**: Spend 1 Military. Place 1 Legion + General from Available Leaders in governed province.
- **Train Legions**: Spend 1 Military. Flip 1 reduced-strength Legion to full.
- **Move Army**: Spend 1 Military per move to adjacent region. Free move into/out of capital if empty.
- **Initiate Battle**: Spend 1 Military. Battle occurs immediately.
- **Disperse Mob**: Spend 1 Military. Subtract 1 support, remove Mobs = number of units in army.

#### Senate Actions
- **Recruit Governor**: Spend Senate = Governor’s cost. Place in Available Leaders.
- **Place Governor**: Replace Governor in target province. Votes needed = 2 × support level. Modify: +1 per enemy unit in capital, −1 per your unit in capital (min 1). Roll 1d6 per Senate influence spent. 2–5 = 1 vote, 6 = 1 vote + bonus die. Neutral target: 1 = 1 vote. Success: Remove Mobs and Militia, place your Governor, reduce support by 1 (min 1), adjust Italia support.
- **Recall Governor**: Spend 2 Senate. Return your Governor to Available Leaders, place Neutral Governor at 1, adjust Italia support.

#### Populace Actions
- **Increase Support Level**: Spend Populace = value of next higher support space. Cannot be used in Italia.
- **Place Militia**: Spend 2 Populace. Place in capital of governed province with no enemy units and no existing Militia.
- **Hold Games**: Spend 2 Populace. Remove 1 Mob.
- **Build Improvement**: Spend 3 Populace. Province must have no Mob, active Barbarians, Rival Emperor, or enemy army in capital. Improvements:
  - **Amphitheater**: No Mob added during End of Turn.
  - **Basilica**: +1 die when placing Governor in Italia.
  - **Limes**: Invading Barbarians enter and pass through on inactive side.

### Combat
- **Units & Dice**:
  - Legion, Militia, Barbarian: 1d6
  - Barbarian Leader: 2d6
  - Rival Emperor: 3d6
- **To Hit**:
  - Full-strength Legion: 3+
  - Barbarian, Leader, Rival Emperor: 4+
  - Reduced Legion, Militia: 5+
  - 6 = hit + bonus die (unlimited).
- **Damage**: Simultaneous. Full-strength Legion flipped on hit; all others eliminated.
- **Hit Allocation**: Attacker allocates hits on Barbarians freely. Defender takes hits in order: Militia, Barbarians (Foederati), Legions.
- **Victory**: Most hits wins (tie → defender). If one side eliminated, other wins. Winner gains 2 legacy +1 per Barbarian counter removed.
- **Retreat**: Defeated Roman army in capital must retreat to province. Defeated Barbarians return to homeland active.
- **Advance**: Victorious Roman army may advance into vacant capital.

### Event Cards
- **Castra**: Place on army you command. When attacked, hits reduced by 1. Removed start of next turn or if army attacks, moves, or retreats.
- **Flanking Maneuver**: Play before battle (you are attacker). After seeing results, re-roll all your dice. Must use new result. One per battle.
- **Praetorian Guard**: Attempt Place Governor in Italia using Military influence, ignoring Quaestor or units in capital.
- **Tribute**: Flip all barbarians of one tribe in one province to inactive. They defend normally but cause no support loss.
- **Foederati**: Remove one non-leader barbarian from region within 1 movement of your army. If army has fewer barbarians than legions, it joins; else, return to homeland inactive.
- **Damnatio Memoriae**: Play after becoming Emperor. Subtract legacy from former Emperor = your support in Italia. Place Mobs = former Emperor’s Italia support in your provinces.
- **Quaestor**: Place in province you govern. To gain vote in Place Governor, need 3+ die roll. Removed start of next turn or if replaced as Governor.
- **Mob**: Place in province without one. Reduces income and may cause Governor removal.
- **Pretender**: Play if not Emperor, govern ≥2 adjacent provinces with ≥3 support. Place Seat of Power in one, Breakaway in others.

### Mobs
- Reduce province’s political points by 1 per Mob.
- During Support Check, if Mobs ≥ support, Governor is removed.
- During End of Turn, add 1 Mob to each governed province with a Mob and no Amphitheater.
- Removed by Disperse Mob, Hold Games, or Governor replacement.

### Pretenders
- Created via Pretender event. Seat of Power province is capital; others marked Breakaway.
- Pretender provinces immune to Place Governor.
- During Expand Pretender Empire, add Breakaway to adjacent governed provinces with ≥3 support.
- Occupying Breakaway capital removes marker and replaces Governor at 1.
- Occupying Seat of Power capital dissolves empire (remove all markers).
- Sole Pretender gains 1 legacy per Pretender province.
- Emperor gains legacy = Italia support − number of Pretender provinces.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### Gain Legacy Phase
1. **Pretender**: +1 legacy per Seat of Power/Breakaway province (if only Pretender).
2. **Emperor**: Remove your Pretender markers. Gain legacy = max(0, Italia support − # Pretender provinces). Advance Emperor Turns if no Pretenders/Rival Emperors.
3. **All Players**: +1 legacy per governed province, +1 per improvement.

### Game End
- Triggered when a player ends turn as Emperor with ≥60 legacy.
- Game ends after all players have taken equal turns.
- **OR** immediately if Diocletian event is drawn.
- **Bonus Legacy**: Based on Emperor Turns:
  - 1st: 10
  - 2nd: 6
  - 3rd: 3
  - 4th: 0
  - Tie: all tied players receive same bonus.
- **Victory**: Most legacy wins. Tiebreakers:
  1. Current Emperor
  2. Current Pretender
  3. Most provinces
  4. Most legions
  5. Highest die roll.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
