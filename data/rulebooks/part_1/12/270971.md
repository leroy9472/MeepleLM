1. Lore & Objective  
The Roman Empire has fallen, and Europe enters a transformative era. As lords, players compete to build the most prosperous and glorious medieval domain in Iberia.

3. Setup  
- Form the supply: Sort buildings by type, walls by length, dice by color.  
- With 2 players: Return 1 of each building type and 1 die of each color to the box.  
- Place tracking tokens next to supply:  
  - 4 players: Use all 5 tokens  
  - 2–3 players: Use 3 tokens (return 2 to box)  
- Each player takes:  
  - 1 player board, 1 screen, 6 resource pegs  
  - 3 yellow dice, 1 gray die  
  - 1 Keep, 3 Longhouses, 1 Farm, 3 walls (length 4)  
  - Scorched areas:  
    - 2 players: 2 each  
    - 3 players: 1 each  
    - 4 players: 0  
- Set pegs on resource track:  
  - 0 Trade Goods, 1 Stone, 2 Wood, 3 Food  
  - 0 Culture, 0 Disaster  
- Players secretly arrange their starting domain (Keep, Farm, Longhouses, Walls, Scorched Areas) behind screens.  
- Reveal domains.  
- Each player rolls gray die; highest swords becomes starting player and places black peg in (Roll) spot on their board.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game is played in rounds of 6 steps. Each step is completed by all players before moving to the next.  
- Step 1: ROLL — Simultaneous  
- Steps 2–6: Turn-based, clockwise from starting player  

Steps:  
1. ROLL  
2. COLLECT  
3. FEED  
4. DISASTERS  
5. BUILD  
6. EXTORT  

At end of round:  
- Check if game end condition is met (see Scoring & End Game).  
- If not, starting player passes black peg to left; new starting player places it in (Roll) spot.  

5. Core Mechanics  
**Dice Rolling (Step 1)**  
- Roll all dice simultaneously behind screen.  
- First roll: Set aside any skulls (cannot be rerolled).  
- Optional second roll: Reroll any non-skull dice.  
- Set aside new skulls.  
- Optional third roll: Reroll any non-skull dice (including previously set-aside non-skull dice).  
- After final roll, reveal all dice.  
- White dice showing feather: May be rerolled openly in player order (can use another die, even with skull).  

**Collect (Step 2)**  
- Add resources (trade goods, stone, wood, food) and culture shown on dice.  
- Culture only from white and blue dice.  
- Add:  
  - 1 food per Farm  
  - 2 wood per Lumber Mill  
- Excess beyond track capacity is lost.  
- If culture peg exceeds track: Record “+25” on score sheet, reset peg to 0.  

**Feed (Step 3)**  
- Subtract 1 food per die in pool.  
- For each die not fed: Advance disaster track 1.  
- If disaster track exceeds capacity: Record “–25” on score sheet, reset peg to 0.  

**Disasters (Step 4)**  
- If any skulls rolled, resolve one disaster (total skulls determine effect).  
- Resolve in clockwise order starting with starting player.  
- Effects (from Appendix):  
  - 1 skull: Remove 1 resource of your choice  
  - 2 skulls: Gain disaster points equal to number of clustered buildings (orthogonally adjacent)  
  - 3 skulls: Give 1 scorched area to each opponent  
  - 4+ skulls: Remove 1 building (chosen by player) and return to box  

**Build (Step 5)**  
- Starting player first, then clockwise.  
- 1 build per hammer (🪓) rolled.  
- Spend required resources to build 1 wall or 1 building.  
- Structures must be available in supply.  
- Walls: Any length; buildings: As listed.  
- Placement: Any orientation, must fit.  
- Walled Building: Fully enclosed by orthogonally adjacent walls and/or keeps.  
- Diagonally adjacent structures are not adjacent for adjacency or clustering.  
- If last building of a type is taken: Flip a blank tracking token to X side.  
- Benefits are cumulative (e.g., 2 Monasteries = set 2 dice).  

**Extort (Step 6)**  
- Starting player first, then clockwise.  
- Demand 1 resource (food, wood, stone, trade good) from each player with fewer swords (⚔️) showing.  
- Target must have the resource.  
- Protection: If a player’s shields (🛡️) ≥ another’s swords, they are immune to that player’s extortion.  
- If target cannot or refuses to pay: Advance disaster track 2 per unpaid resource.  
- Resources extorted from others are added to your track.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Condition**  
- Game ends at end of round if:  
  - 4 players: 5 building types exhausted  
  - 2–3 players: 3 building types exhausted  
- Or, in solo: After 8 rounds.  

**Scoring**  
- Buildings: Score base points. Walled buildings worth double.  
- Bonus Points:  
  - Market: 10 pts if all 8 orthogonally adjacent spaces are empty  
  - Guildhall: 10 pts if adjacent to 4 different building types  
  - University: 5 pts per die in your pool  
  - Cathedral: 10 pts per die in your pool  
  - Harbor (Collector Set): 4 pts per burgher (blue) die  
  - Great Hall (Collector Set): 4 pts per noble (gray) die (must be completely walled when built)  
- Culture: 1 pt per culture point. Player(s) with most (≥1) gain 5 bonus pts.  
- Walled Area: Player(s) with largest total enclosed area gain 10 bonus pts.  
  - Count interior spaces and building-occupied spaces (except keeps) fully enclosed by walls.  
  - Scorched areas not counted.  
- Disasters: –1 pt per disaster point on track.  

**Winning**  
- Highest score wins.  
- Tiebreakers:  
  1. Most trade goods  
  2. Most stone  
  3. Most wood  
  4. Most food  
- If still tied, share victory.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a building be both walled and adjacent to a scorched area?** Yes, as long as fully enclosed by walls.  
- **Do keeps count toward enclosed area size?** No, but spaces they occupy are counted.  
- **Can you build on a scorched area?** No.  
- **Can walls be placed diagonally?** Yes, but diagonal walls do not enclose.  
- **Can you reroll a white die with feather after resolving all steps?** No — reroll immediately after final dice reveal, before resolving feathers.  
- **Can you extort from a player with same number of swords?** No — only from those with fewer.  
- **Do skulls from Sir Philippe affect you in solo?** No — only your own skulls trigger disasters affecting you.
