## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players are descendants of the Sapa Inca Pachacuti, competing to gain fame by spreading the Inca Empire. Victory is achieved through worship, crafting tapestries, conquests across four regions (Chinchaysuyu, Antisuyu, Qullasuyu, Kuntisuyu), constructing steps and statues, and other achievements. The player with the most Victory Points (VP) after the third Festival wins.

2. Components  
- 1 Game Board  
- 40–45 Workers (9 per color, adjusted by player count)  
- 20 Passive Buildings, 19 Production Buildings  
- 35 Weaving tiles (including 4 starting Weavings)  
- 12 Small Statues, 6 Large Statues  
- 4 Multiplier tiles (resources)  
- 1 Festival tile, 1 Coricancha tile  
- Resources: 25 Stone, 25 Corn, 30 Potato, 20 Gold (unlimited via proxies)  
- 42 God cards, 30 Army cards, 1 Draw Bag  
- Player components per player:  
  - 1 High Priest  
  - 10 Conquest markers  
  - 5 Steps markers  
  - 1 Scoring marker  
  - 1 Temple marker  
  - Player aid  

3. Setup  
1. Place board; form general supply of resources.  
2. Each player receives all personal components. Place scoring marker at 10, Temple marker at bottom of track.  
3. Randomly rotate Coricancha tile (or use board-printed version for first game).  
4. Adjust Workers:  
   - 2 players: 40 Workers in play (remove 1 of each color)  
   - 3 players: 35 Workers (remove 2 of each color)  
   - 4 players: all 45  
5. Each player draws 2 Workers from bag. If same color, draw a third and return one duplicate.  
6. Fill Village with Workers per player count (queue between corn/potato icons).  
7. Place Nomads (number per player count).  
8. In 2-player games, place 1 Worker on each marked top-terrace space.  
9. Shuffle Production and Passive Buildings separately; reveal 2 of each type → Building Market (4 total).  
10. Shuffle Army cards into deck; place near market.  
11. Separate Statues by God icon; place near market.  
12. Set aside 4 starting Weavings. Remove Weaving tiles as follows:  
   - 3 players: remove #4 tiles  
   - 2 players: also remove #3+ tiles  
   - Shuffle rest; reveal top Weaving.  
13. Determine first player (e.g., last to harvest vegetable).  
14. Each player picks one starting Weaving (in turn order). Return unused.  
15. Give each player 2 Stone.  
16. Shuffle God cards; deal 8 to each player. Each keeps 3, plays 5 face-up for benefits.  
   - Benefits resolved in reverse turn order.  
   - Used cards shuffled back; form central offer: 3/4/5 cards for 2/3/4 players.  
17. Place Festival tile nearby.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, choose one:  
A. Place a Worker  
B. Perform 2 different secondary actions  

After main action:  
- Optionally recruit 1 Worker from Village (pay 1 corn or potato)  
- Enforce Worker limit: max 2 at turn end. Excess removed.  
- Replenish Building Market to 2 of each type.  

Festival triggered if Village empties at turn end.

5. Core Mechanics  

Worker Placement (Option A):  
- Cost: Discard matching God card **or** pay 1 gold.  
- Must also pay Roaming + Descending costs in food (corn/potato).  
  - **Roaming Cost**:  
    - Same section: 0  
    - Adjacent section: 1  
    - Non-adjacent: 3  
  - **Descending Cost**:  
    - Top terrace: 0  
    - Middle: 2  
    - Bottom: 5  
  - Reduced by 2 per Steps marker above (same section). Owner gains 1 VP per use.  
- Number of tasks = 1 + Worker abilities + 1 per adjacent same-color Worker.  
- Tasks distributed as evenly as possible among 3 adjacent icons.  

Worker Abilities:  
- **Architect**: +1 task on blue spaces  
- **Craftsman**: +1 task on green spaces  
- **Courier**: -1 total placement cost; +1 task if first in segment  
- **Priest**: Pay 1 potato for +1 task; draw 1 God card after tasks  
- **Warrior**: Draw 1 Army card; retrieve 1 adjacent non-Warrior Worker  

Tasks:  
- **Collect Resources**: Gain 3 potato, 2 corn, 2 stone, or 1 gold  
- **Construct Building**: Pay cost; may discard 1 God card to replace 1–2 market buildings  
- **Build Steps**: Pay 3 stone → gain 4 VP, 1 corn, 2 potato. Must build upper before lower in section. Owner of upper Steps gains 2 VP when lower built.  
- **Build Statue**:  
  - Small: 3 stone → 3 VP  
  - Large: 3 stone + 2 gold → 9 VP  
- **Purchase Weavings**: Draw 3 (incl. face-up); buy 1/2/3 for 1/3/6 corn. Leftovers offered to others (1 each, 2 corn). Must add to tapestry end or start new.  
- **Training**: Draw 2 Army cards, keep 1, discard other  
- **Produce One**: Gain benefit of 1 face-up Production Building (remains face-up)  
- **Merchant**: Gain rewards from matching connections in Tapestries  

Secondary Actions (Option B – choose 2 different):  
- **Move High Priest**: 1–2 steps clockwise; activate action or gain 1 gold  
- **Pray**: Take 2 God cards (from offer or deck)  
- **Train**: Draw 2 Army cards, keep 1, discard other  
- **Recruit**: Take 1 Worker from Nomads; refill from bag  

High Priest Actions (triggered by moving):  
- **Produce**: All players may flip face-down Production Buildings to gain benefits. Active player may flip 1 face-up before/after.  
- **Worship**:  
  - Active: Discard 1 large Statue → +3 steps; 1 small → +1 step (max 1 each)  
  - Others: Discard 1 Statue → +1 step  
- **Offering**:  
  - Active: Pay 2/4/6 corn → +1/2/3 steps  
  - Others: Pay 3 corn → +1 step  
- **Conquest**:  
  - Move 1 Worker (Village or Nomads) to Casualties of War  
  - All players may play Army cards (1 potato each); active plays first free  
  - In turn order: place 1 Conquest marker (discard/flip Soldiers as required)  
  - Active player may place second marker  
- **Rejuvenate**:  
  - All: Pay 1 food per Building/Army card to flip face-up  
  - Active: Pay food; may flip 1 free  

Recruit at End of Turn:  
- Pay 1 corn or potato to take Worker from either end of Village  
- Triggers Festival if last Worker taken  

Festival (Scoring):  
Triggered when Village empties. Active player takes Festival tile and gains:  
- 1 VP (1st), 2 VP (2nd), 4 VP (3rd)  

Resolved before next turn:  
1. All players perform free Merchant action  
2. Gain VP and left-side benefit at current Temple position  
3. Conquest scoring: Most markers per region → VP = number in Casualties of War. Tie: rightmost marker wins.  
4. Pay 1 potato per God card in hand. Lose 2 VP per missing potato.  
5. Skip next steps if 3rd Festival  
6. Refill Village from bag  
7. Festival Card Draw:  
   - 2-player: Fewest VP → 2 cards, Most → 1  
   - 3-player: Fewest → 2, Middle → 2, Most → 1  
   - 4-player: Fewest → 2, Second → 2, Third → 1, Most → 1  
   - Ties: closest clockwise to active player has “more”  
   - Then: each may play up to 3 God cards for benefits (shuffled back)  
8. Refresh Building Market  

6. Scoring & End Game
