3. Setup

- Each player chooses a color and takes the corresponding 14 armies and 3 cities.  
- Each player places 3 armies on the starting region.  
- For 2 players only: Alternate placing 10 neutral (third color) armies on any regions until all are placed.  
- Place coin tokens in a supply pile.  
- Starting coins:  
  - 5 players: 8 coins  
  - 4 players: 9 coins  
  - 3 players: 11 coins  
  - 2 players: 14 coins  
- Bid to determine first player (see Gameplay).

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Bid for First Player**:  
   - All players simultaneously and secretly bid coins using a closed fist.  
   - Reveal bids simultaneously.  
   - Highest bidder wins, pays their bid to the supply.  
   - Tiebreaker: Youngest player wins. If all bids are 0, youngest player wins.  
   - Winner chooses who takes the first turn.  
   - Only one bid occurs per game.

2. **Turn Sequence (Clockwise Order)**:  
   - On your turn, choose one of the six face-up cards.  
   - Pay the coin cost based on the card’s position (from left to right): 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3.  
   - Take the card and perform its action immediately.  
   - Optional: You may take the card and ignore the action.  
   - Actions include:  
     - **Place Armies**: Place up to X armies (shown on card) on your starting region or any region with your city. Armies may be split across regions.  
     - **Move Armies**: Move armies up to X times total (e.g., move one army X times, or multiple armies with total moves ≤ X). Movement is land-only; cannot cross dotted ocean lines.  
     - **Move Over Land and/or Water**: Same as Move Armies, but may move between regions connected by dotted lines (treat as adjacent).  
     - **Build a City**: Place one of your cities on any region where you have at least one army. Multiple cities (from any players) may occupy the same region.  
     - **Destroy Army**: Remove one army (any player) from any region.  
   - "And" actions: Perform both.  
   - "Or" actions: Choose one.  
   - After taking a card:  
     - Slide remaining cards left to fill the gap.  
     - Draw a new card and place it in the rightmost position.  
   - Play passes to the next player clockwise.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Control of Regions**: A player controls a region if they have more armies in it than any other player. Cities count as one army. Tied armies = no control.  
- **Control of Continents**: A player controls a continent if they control more regions within it than any other player. Tie = no control.  
- **Goods Collection**: Each card provides one good (e.g., Crystals, Spices). Wild cards can substitute for any one good.  
- **Scoring Goods**: Points are based on number of cards of the same good, as shown on the card (e.g., 1 Crystals = 1 VP, 2 = 2 VP, 3 = 3 VP, 4 = 5 VP).  
- **Card Availability**: Cards are always replenished to maintain 6 face-up options.  
- **Optional Rule**: Players may take a card and ignore its action.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when each player has acquired a set number of cards:  
  - 2 players: 13 cards each  
  - 3 players: 10 cards each  
  - 4 players: 8 cards each  
  - 5 players: 7 cards each  
- Final scoring:  
  - **Regions**: 1 VP per region controlled.  
  - **Continents**: 1 VP per continent controlled.  
  - **Goods**: Score each set of goods using the point values on the cards. Wild cards may be assigned to any good (one extra per Wild).  
- **Victory**: Player with the most total VP wins.  
- **Tiebreakers (in order)**:  
  1. Most coins  
  2. Most armies on the board  
  3. Most controlled regions

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Tied Bids**: Youngest player wins. Applies even if all bid 0.  
- **Neutral Armies (2-player)**: Do not belong to any player; count toward control if present.  
- **City Placement**: Must have at least one army in the region.  
- **Movement**: "Move Armies" and "Move Over Land and/or Water" allow flexible distribution of movement actions.  
- **Destroy Army**: Can target any player’s army, including your own.  
- **Wild Cards**: Assigned during scoring; one Wild = +1 to any one good.  
- **Goods Tokens (Variant)**: If used, randomly place one on each region marked with a triangle. Controlling that region grants +1 of the depicted good.  
- **Alternate Tiebreaker (Variant)**: Roll a die instead of using age for bidding tie.
