### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Player Main Phase  
During this phase, perform any of the following actions in any order and any number of times:  

##### ACTION: Move Your Leader (Once per Turn)  
- Move your Leader to any adjacent Province.  
- Adjacent = shares a border OR is connected via anchor (anchor Provinces are mutually adjacent).  
- Movement is unaffected by other Leaders, Banners, or Defense towers.  

##### ACTION: Gain an Ally (Once per Turn)  
- If conditions are met, gain an available Ally card and place it next to your player mat.  
- Allies grant persistent abilities.  
- Once gained, an Ally cannot be lost, even if conditions are no longer met.  

##### ACTION: Use an “Action” Ability  
- Play a card with an "Action:" ability from your hand.  
- Place it in your play area.  
- Resolve the ability.  
- You do **not** gain Labor or Strength from this card this turn.  

##### ACTION: Promote a Card  
Upgrade a card using Labor and/or Strength.  
Steps:  
1. Choose 1 card from hand or discard pile to Promote.  
2. Play cards from hand to pay Promotion cost (HAMMER/Labor or SWORD/Strength).  
   - Use either Labor **or** Strength from each card, not both.  
   - Cannot use the promoted card itself to pay.  
   - Cannot promote cards already played (in play area).  
3. Retrieve the named card from the Upgrade deck and place it in your discard pile.  
4. Return the promoted card to its starting location:  
   - Realm deck → place on bottom.  
   - Starter card → remove from game.  
- Promotions must be done one at a time.  
- **Wandering One**: Promotes into a random card from the Numerai upgrade deck.  

##### ACTION: Cull Cards  
Remove cards from your deck at the cost of gaining Cruelty.  
Steps:  
1. Play a card from hand for its Strength (×).  
2. Select up to that many cards from hand or discard pile.  
3. Return selected cards to starting location:  
   - Realm deck card → place on bottom of deck.  
   - Starter card → remove from game.  
4. Gain 1 Cruelty for **each** card culled.  
- Cannot cull the card used to pay Strength.  
- Cannot cull already played cards (in play area).  
- Cannot reduce total cards (hand + deck + discard + play area) below 5.  
- Any remaining Strength is lost.  

##### ACTION: Build a Structure  
Unlock persistent abilities and gain Influence at endgame.  
Steps:  
1. Choose a Structure that is next in line on one of your Structure trees.  
   - Must have built all prior Structures in that tree.  
2. Pay Labor cost using cards from hand:  
   - At least one card must be from the matching Faction (unless General tree).  
   - Any extra Labor is lost.  
3. Move your cube to that Structure on your player mat.  
- Structure ability is active immediately and permanently.  
- Previous Structures in the same tree remain active.  

##### ACTION: Conquer a Province  
Only possible if your Leader is in an uncontrolled or enemy-controlled Province.  

**Uncontrolled Province**:  
1. Choose Attacking Troops: Play 1+ cards for Strength. The highest Strength card determines dice rolled.  
2. Resolve "When you play this" or "Conquer" effects (in any order).  
3. Roll Attack dice: number = Strength of highest card played.  
4. Resolve rerolls (if any).  
5. Calculate Strength: sum of dice + all cards played **except** the one with highest Strength.  
6. Success if total ≥ Province’s current defense (towers: 3-defense = +3, 1-defense = +1).  
7. If successful:  
   - Place your Banner on a tower piece.  
   - Recruit 2 cards from the Realm deck (top cards → discard pile).  
8. Resolve Ruin: for each Ruin symbol rolled, remove 1 defense (remove tower pieces).  

**Controlled Province (vs. Defender)**:  
1. **Attacker**: chooses 1+ cards, places facedown, announces count.  
2. **Defender**: chooses any number of cards **with defend icon**, places facedown, then draws that many cards.  
3. Reveal all cards.  
4. Resolve effects:  
   - Attacker first: "When you play this" or "Conquer" effects.  
   - Then Defender: "When you play this" or "Defend" effects.  
5. Roll dice: both roll number = Strength of their highest card.  
6. Reroll: Attacker first, then Defender.  
7. Total Strength: dice + all cards **except** highest Strength card.  
8. Attacker wins if:  
   - Total Strength ≥ (Province defense + Defender’s total Strength)  
9. If Attacker wins:  
   - Place Banner, remove Defender’s Banner.  
   - Recruit 2 cards from Realm deck.  
10. Resolve Ruin:  
   - Defender’s Ruin: Attacker must Cull cards played during this action with total Strength ≥ Ruin rolled.  
     - No Cruelty gained from this Cull.  
   - Attacker’s Ruin: remove defense from Province (1 per Ruin).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End of Year Scoring (After Each Year)  
1. **Per Controlled Province**: gain Influence = current defense value.  
2. **Per Controlled Realm**: gain Influence for each Realm where you control ≥2 Provinces:  
   - Year 1: 4 Influence per Realm  
   - Year 2: 8 Influence per Realm  
   - Year 3: 12 Influence per Realm  
- If a player reaches 50 Influence, use a second cube to track beyond 50.  

#### End of Game Scoring (After Year 3)  
Add:  
1. Influence value of **every card** in hand, deck, and discard pile.  
2. Influence value of each Ally you have.  
3. 1 Influence for each Structure built.  
4. Additional Influence from each Level 4 Structure built (value specified on Structure).  
- **Winner**: player with most total Influence.  
- **Tiebreaker**: player who gained the most Influence during the **3rd End of Year Scoring** wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move through enemy-controlled Provinces?** Yes. Movement is unrestricted.  
- **Can I build Structures out of order?** No. Must complete prior Structures in the tree.  
- **Can I use a card’s Labor and Strength in the same turn?** Only if used separately (e.g., Labor for Build, Strength for Cull). Cannot use both from same card unless played twice.  
- **What happens if a Realm deck is empty during recruitment?** You do not recruit cards from it.  
- **Can I recruit a second card during End Phase if the deck has only one card?** Yes, as long as it’s not empty.  
- **Can I Cull cards to below 5 total?** No. Minimum total cards (hand, deck, discard, play area) is 5.  
- **Do I gain Cruelty when forced to Cull by Ruin?** No. Only voluntary Culls grant Cruelty.  
- **Can I use an Ally’s ability the turn I gain it?** Yes, immediately.  
- **What happens when defense reaches zero?** Province can still be controlled; place Banner directly on Province.  
- **Can 3-defense and 1-defense towers be swapped?** Yes: 1 × 3-defense = 3 × 1-defense, and vice versa.  
- **Morality caps**: At 12 Cruelty or Mercy, gaining another gives 1 Influence instead.
