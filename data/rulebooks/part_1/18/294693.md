## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Nokosu Dice is a trick-taking game for 3–4 players combining cards and dice as playable components. The goal is to score the most points over multiple rounds by winning tricks and achieving specific scoring conditions. "Nokosu" (Japanese for "to leave") refers to the leftover die players keep, which may trigger bonus points if its value matches their trick count. Players may also earn bonuses by successfully declaring they will win zero tricks.

### 2. Components  
- 40 Number Cards: 5 suits (colors), ranks 0–7  
- 25 Dice: 5 dice per suit (color), each die a D6  
- 1 Dice Bag  
- 4 Zero Tricks Declaration Cards (one per player)  
- Rule Sheets (English and Japanese)

### 3. Setup  

#### For 4 Players:  
- Shuffle and deal 10 cards to each player  
- Each player draws 2 dice, rolls them, and keeps in front  
- Dealer draws 13 dice, rolls them, and places in the center  
- Players draft 3 dice each from the center (starting left of dealer), one at a time, until 1 die remains  
- This last die sets the trump for the round  
- Each player receives a Zero Tricks Card (placed face up)  

#### For 3 Players:  
- Remove all 7s and all cards/dice of one full color  
- Return removed components to the box  
- Deal 9 cards to each player; 1 card remains unused (set aside face down)  
- Each player draws and rolls 1 die  
- Dealer draws 10 dice, rolls, and places in center  
- Players draft 3 dice each from center (starting left of dealer), until 1 die remains  
- This die sets trump  
- Each player has 4 dice total (1 drawn + 3 drafted)  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Trump Determination**: The undrafted die in center sets trump  
2. **Zero Tricks Declaration**: Starting left of dealer, each player may declare Zero Tricks:  
   - If declared, return one die to the bag and flip Zero Tricks Card face down  
3. **Trick Play**:  
   - First trick: led by player left of dealer  
   - Subsequent tricks: led by previous trick winner  
   - Each player plays one card or die per trick  
   - Must follow suit if possible  
   - Trumps beat non-trumps; highest trump wins  
   - If no trump, highest of led suit wins  
   - Ties: last-played card/die of same strength wins  
4. **Duration**:  
   - 4 players: 14 tricks (10 cards + 4 dice per player)  
   - 3 players: 12 tricks (9 cards + 3 dice per player)  
5. **Hand End**: After final trick, scoring occurs  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Trump Suit  
The central die determines trump. Any card or die matching its **color or number** (or both) is a trump.  
**Trump Hierarchy (from strongest to weakest):**  
1. Same **color and number** as trump die  
2. Same **number** as trump die (all colors equal strength)  
3. Same **color** as trump die (ranked by number: high to low)  

**Important Notes:**  
- A trump no longer belongs to its original color suit  
- Cards and dice are functionally equivalent: e.g., blue 4 card = blue 4 die  
- Players who **did not declare Zero Tricks** keep one die unplayed ("Nokosu die")  
- Players who **declared Zero Tricks** play all 4 dice and have no leftover die  

#### Following Suit  
- Must follow the **lead suit** if possible  
- If lead is a trump (matches trump die in color or number), must follow with a trump if able  
- If unable to follow suit or trump, may play any card or die  

#### Trick Resolution  
- Strongest trump wins  
- If no trump played, highest of lead suit wins  
- If equal strength (same suit and value), the **last-played** item wins  

### 6. Scoring & End Game
