- Give each player 2 coins. Keep coins visible.  
- Place remaining coins in the center as the Treasury.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise.  
- On a turn, the active player chooses **one action** (must act, cannot pass).  
- If a player starts their turn with 10 or more coins, they **must** take the Coup action.  
- After the action is declared:  
  1. Other players may **challenge** the action.  
  2. Target(s) may **counteract** (if applicable).  
- Challenges are resolved **before** counteractions or action resolution.  
- Order of resolution:  
  1. Action claim & target declaration (challenge if desired)  
  2. Additional claims of same action (challenge if desired)  
  3. Counteraction claims (challenge if desired)  
  4. Counteraction(s) applied  
  5. Original action applied  
- A player is eliminated when they lose all face-down Influence cards (lives).  
- Game ends when one player remains.

5. Core Mechanics  
**Influence & Lives**  
- Each face-down Influence card is a life and represents hidden role allegiance.  
- When a player loses a life, they reveal one face-down card (their choice).  
- Revealed cards remain visible and no longer count as influence.  
- Eliminated players reveal all cards, return coins to Treasury, and exit.

**Actions**  
- Players may take any available action, regardless of actual Influence cards.  
- **General Actions** (always available, cannot be challenged or counteracted):  
  - **Income**: Take 1 credit from Treasury.  
  - **Coup**: Pay 7 credits to Treasury; target loses a life. Always succeeds.  
- **Role Actions**: Must claim a role in play. Can bluff.  
  - **Communications** (Deck interactions):  
    - **Producer (C1)**: Take 1 random card from Deck and 1 from target (target's choice). May swap any with own cards, then return 1 to Deck and 1 to target. Target may claim Producer to avoid exchange.  
    - **Director (C2)**: Take 2 random cards from Deck. May swap any with own, then return 2 to Deck.

    - **General (F03)**: Pay 5 credits; all others lose a life. Targets may claim General to avoid.  
    - **Mercenary (F04)**: Pay 3 credits; place Disappear token on target. If still present at end of target's next turn, target loses a life. Target may claim Mercenary (when targeted or on next turn) to remove token and avoid loss.

    - **Protestor (S15)**: Pay 2 credits; declare target. If not challenged, another player may pay 3 credits to join Riot; target loses life. If no one joins, action fails (no refund). After Riot forms, target may claim Protestor to avoid.  
    - **Foreign Consular (S16)**: Take both Treaty tokens; keep one, give one to another player. The two cannot target each other (including with Coup) unless final two players.  
    - **Missionary (S17)**: When losing a life (not via Coup), may claim Missionary. Put card aside face-down, draw 1 from Deck. If challenged and fails, lose another life (may claim Missionary again). If successful, challenger loses a life.  
    - **Customs Officer (S18)**: Take both Tax tokens; keep one, place one on a role card. Before claiming that role, players must pay 1 credit to token holder. If holder is eliminated, remove token.  
    - **Intellectual (S19)**: When losing a life, may claim Intellectual. Put card aside face-down, take 5 credits. If challenged and fails, lose another life. If successful, challenger loses a life.  
    - **Lawyer (S110)**: When a player is eliminated, may claim Lawyer to take all their coins. If multiple claim, divide equally; excess to Treasury.

**Counteractions**  
- Can be claimed by target (or any player for some roles) to block certain effects.  
- Operate like Role Actions: can bluff, must prove if challenged.  
- If not challenged, counteraction succeeds.  
- If successful, only the blocked effect is negated (e.g., life loss prevented, but cost still paid).  
- Counteractions are resolved after challenges, before action resolution.

**Challenges**  
- Any player may challenge a Role Action or Counteraction (General Actions cannot be challenged).  
- Must be declared before next claim or action resolution.  
- Challenged player must reveal if they hold the claimed role.  
  - If they do: challenger loses a life. Challenged player returns card to Deck, shuffles, draws replacement (keeps secret). Then action proceeds.  
  - If they don’t: challenged player loses a life. Action fails; any paid costs are returned.  
- Multiple challenges: resolved in order declared, then clockwise from active player.
