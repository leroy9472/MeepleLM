### 1. Lore & Objective
In KREMLIN, players represent political factions vying for control of the Soviet Politburo. The game simulates the power struggles, purges, and intrigue characteristic of Soviet leadership politics. The objective varies slightly by variant but generally centers on controlling the Party Chief during three successful October Parades. If no player achieves this by Turn 10, the winner is determined by control of the Party Chief or by a scoring system in certain variants.

### 2. Components
- Game board with Politburo, Candidate, and People slots
- 26 Politician cards (including "Nestor Aparatschik" as starting Party Chief)
- 34 Intrigue cards (Advanced Game)
- Influence Point (IP) markers and sheets
- Stress Point (SP) markers (for aging)
- Cure, Sick (+), Double Sick (++), and Suspicion (?) markers
- 20-sided die
- Faction markers

### 3. Setup
- Shuffle Intrigue cards (red: 1–36) and place face down.
- Each player receives:
  - Influence Point sheet
  - Full set of faction IP markers
  - 3 random Intrigue cards
- Place "Nestor Aparatschik" in the Party Chief slot with a + marker.
- Shuffle remaining 25 Politicians; deal 12 into Politburo and Candidate slots.
- Place 4 oldest remaining Politicians in the People box; rest are ordered by age beneath.
- Players secretly assign 10 Influence Points (IP) to 10 Politicians (1–10, one each).
- After assignment, players may declare IP publicly at any time.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of eight phases:
1. **Cure**: Sick (+ or ++) Politburo members may go to the Sanatorium. Aging occurs.
2. **Purge**: KGB Head may attempt to purge Politburo or Candidate members.
3. **Spy Investigation**: Defense Minister may conduct Trials, Condemnations, Investigations, or Burning Dossiers.
4. **Health**: All Politburo members roll on Health Table; +++ results in death.
5. **Funeral Commission**: If Party Chief is vacant, Foreign Minister nominates a successor.
6. **Replacement**: Party Chief shifts, promotes, or demotes members; automatic promotions by age fill vacancies.
7. **Rehabilitation**: Politburo members may return exiled politicians from Siberia.
8. **Parade**: Party Chief attempts to "wave" at the October Parade; success marks faction progress.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Influence & Control**: Players declare IP to control Politicians. Most declared IP wins. First to declare 11 IP gains undisputed control (10+ marker).
- **Aging**: 
  - +1 SP for being Party Chief
  - +1 SP per + or ? marker
  - +1 SP if in Weak position
  - -1 SP if in Strong position
  - Max 1 SP aging per turn in Cure Phase (Swiss variant)
- **Purge**: 
  - KGB Head rolls d20 ≥ Purge Number (PC: 18, 1st Level: 14, 2nd Level: 10, Candidates: 6)
  - +3 if target is in Sanatorium
  - Success: target sent to Siberia; KGB Head ages 1 SP
  - Failure: KGB Head ages 3 SP; phase ends
- **Spy Investigation**:
  - Trial: Requires 2 Innocent votes to acquit; else, target to Siberia
  - Condemnation: Instantly sends a Candidate to Siberia (cost: 2 SP)
  - Investigation: Place ? on any member (cost: 1 SP per ?)
  - Burning Dossiers: Remove ? (cost: 1 SP per ?)
- **Strengths & Weaknesses** (Advanced):
  - +2 to Purge Number if in Strength slot
  - -2 to Purge Number if in Weak slot
  - -1 SP aging if in Strength; +1 SP if in Weak
- **Sanatorium**: Inactive; cannot vote or act; ages only for + and ? markers

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Conditions**:
  - Standard: First faction to control the Party Chief during three Parade waves wins.
  - If no three waves by Turn 10, controller of Party Chief at end of Turn 10 wins.
  - Sudden Death: If Politburo vacancies exceed available members, highest-ranking active member’s controller wins.
- **Scoring (Modern Variant)**:
  - 1 pt per successful wave or active 2nd Level member
  - 2 pts per active 1st Level member
  - 3 pts for controlling active Party Chief
  - Tie: Americans win (all lose)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Tie in Influence**: First to declare current total controls; simultaneous declaration resolved by die roll.
- **Inactive Politicians**: In Sanatorium or without declared IP; succession rules apply.
- **Exile**: Politicians may self-exile before Purge or Trial; return via card, IP discard, or card discard.
- **Retirement**: At age 96, retire at end of phase; cannot initiate aging actions.
- **Cure Marker Removal**: Automatic if healthy for full previous year.
