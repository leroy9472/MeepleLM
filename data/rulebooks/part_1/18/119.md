### 1. Lore & Objective
Players act as stall owners in a bustling medieval marketplace, competing to earn the most Heller and Pfennig (coins) over three rounds. The goal is to strategically place market stalls and influence the placement of customer and rogue tiles to maximize profits. Wealthy customers generate income, while rogues cause losses. Special tiles like the Fire, Coin Sack, and 'Böser Blick' (Evil Eye) add complexity and risk. The player with the most coins after three rounds wins.

### 2. Components
- **40 Market Stalls**: 10 per player color. The number of lines (strikes) on a stall indicates its merchandise level, affecting profit and risk.
- **22 Figure Tiles**:
  - 12 Customer Tiles (black numbers 1–6): Pay the stall owner 1–6 coins per unit of merchandise.
  - 6 Rogue Tiles (red numbers 1–6): Cost the stall owner 1–6 coins per unit of merchandise.
  - 1 Coin Sack Tile: Doubles the value of all Figure Tiles (positive and negative) in its row and column.
  - 2 Fire Tiles: Indestructible; divide their row and column into two independent sections for scoring.
  - 1 'Böser Blick' Tile (Evil Eye): In its row and column, only Rogue Tiles are scored; Customer Tiles are ignored.
- **1 Round Counter**: Tracks the current round (1 to 3).
- **Coins (Heller and Pfennig)**: Used for scoring and tracking player wealth.

### 3. Setup
1. Mix all 22 Figure Tiles and place them face down near the board.
2. Give each player:
   - 50 starting coins.
   - 10 Market Stalls in their color (10 stalls per player, though exact distribution by strike level is unspecified).
3. Each player draws one Figure Tile secretly and places it face down in front of them (to be used later).
4. Place the Round Counter on space "1".
5. Randomly choose a starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game is played over 3 rounds. On a player's turn, they must take one of the following actions:
- **Place a Market Stall**: Place one of your Market Stalls on an empty space.
- **Draw and Place a Figure Tile**: Draw one face-down Figure Tile and place it face up on an empty space.
- **Place Your Hidden Tile**: Place the Figure Tile you drew at the start of the round on an empty space.

A player may pass only if none of the three actions are possible. Once placed, Market Stalls and Figure Tiles cannot be moved. Play proceeds clockwise. A round ends when all spaces on the board are occupied.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Board Scoring**: Each row or column is scored when fully occupied. A player may choose to score immediately or wait until the end of the round.
- **Scoring Formula**: For each row or column, a player’s score is calculated as:
  > (Total value of Figure Tiles in the line) × (Merchandise level of the player’s Market Stall in that line)
- **Double Scoring**: Each Market Stall and Figure Tile scores twice—once for its row and once for its column.
- **Special Tile Effects**:
  - **Fire Tile**: Divides its row and column into two separate sections; each section is scored independently.
  - **Coin Sack Tile**: Doubles the total value of all Figure Tiles in its row and column (both positive and negative).
  - **'Böser Blick' (Evil Eye)**: In its row and column, only Rogue Tiles are scored; Customer Tiles have no value.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- After a line (row or column) is scored, players gain or lose coins accordingly. Negative scores must be paid to the supply (players can go into debt).
- At the end of each round:
  - All Market Stalls and Figure Tiles are removed from the board.
  - The Round Counter advances to the next number.
  - Players retrieve only their 1-strike Market Stalls; all others are removed from the game.
  - Used Figure Tiles are reshuffled and placed face down.
  - Each player draws a new hidden Figure Tile.
  - The player with the most coins becomes the starting player for the next round.
- The game ends after 3 rounds. The player with the most coins wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a player score a line before it's full?** No, a line must be fully occupied to be scored.
- **What if a player cannot take any action?** They may pass.
- **How are ties handled?** The rules do not specify a tiebreaker.
- **What happens to unused Market Stalls?** They remain with the player for future rounds, but only 1-strike stalls are returned after each round.
- **Can the Coin Sack and Fire interact?** Yes; the Coin Sack doubles values in each section created by Fire.
- **Does 'Böser Blick' affect the Coin Sack?** The Coin Sack still doubles values, but only Rogue Tiles contribute to the base value in its row/column.
