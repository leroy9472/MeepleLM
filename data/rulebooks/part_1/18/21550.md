## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
TriPakus is a strategy tile-placement game designed for three players. Inspired by square-grid polyomino games (e.g., Blokus), it adapts the core concept into a triangular grid with radial symmetry. The goal is to place all of your pieces on the board by following strict placement rules. The player who successfully places the most pieces—leaving the fewest unplayed segments—wins. The game emphasizes spatial reasoning, forward planning, and efficient use of limited space.

### 2. Components  
- **Game Board**: A large triangular board made of 19 segments per side, assembled from three interlocking sections.  
- **Playing Pieces**: Each player uses one color. For each color:  
  - 22 unique pieces composed of 1 to 6 connected triangular segments.  
  - Pieces include all possible distinct shapes formed by 1–6 unit triangles, up to rotation and reflection.  
- **Materials**:  
  - Game board sections (3 sheets) printed on white or card stock.  
  - Playing pieces (3 copies of Side A and 3 of Side B), printed on three contrasting colors of card stock.  
  - Glue, scissors, and scrap paper for assembly.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Assemble the Board**:  
   - Print 3 copies of the game board section.  
   - Glue overlapping edges (by one row of triangles) to form a large triangle with 19 segments per side.  
2. **Assemble Playing Pieces**:  
   - Print Side A and Side B of the playing pieces on three different colors (one set per player).  
   - For each color: glue Side A and Side B back-to-back, ensuring alignment.  
   - After drying, cut out the 22 individual pieces per color.  
3. **Distribute Components**:  
   - Each player selects one color and takes all 22 pieces of that color.  
4. **Determine First Player**:  
   - Players agree on turn order (e.g., youngest first, or random draw).  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Initial Placement (First Round)**:  
   - The first player places any piece so that it occupies one corner triangle of the board. The piece must align with the board’s triangular grid.  
   - The second player places a piece in a different corner.  
   - The third player places a piece in the remaining corner.  
   - All placements must fully lie on the board and match the grid orientation.  

2. **Continuing Play**:  
   - After all three players have placed their first piece, play continues clockwise.  
   - On a turn, a player places one piece of their color such that:  
     - It touches **at least one** of their previously placed pieces **corner-to-corner** (point-to-point).  
     - It does **not** touch any of their own pieces **side-to-side** or **corner-to-side**.  
     - It **may** touch opponent pieces on any edge or corner.  
   - All parts of the placed piece must lie within the board.  
   - If a player cannot legally place any remaining piece, they **pass** and skip future turns.  

3. **Turn Order**:  
   - Play proceeds in a fixed clockwise order.  
   - Passing does not affect turn order—players continue to be offered turns until no one can play.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Piece Placement Rules**:  
  - Must align exactly with the triangular grid.  
  - Must touch own color only **corner-to-corner** (diagonally adjacent).  
  - No adjacency (side or corner) is allowed between a new piece and any same-color piece except corner-to-corner contact.  
- **Piece Inventory**:  
  - Each player has 22 pieces, ranging from 1 to 6 triangle segments in size.  
  - Total segments per player: 89 (sum of all piece sizes).  
- **Passing**:  
  - A player unable to place any piece passes.  
  - A passed player is skipped in subsequent rounds but may re-enter if a move later becomes possible (though in practice, once passed, they usually cannot return).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Condition**:  
  - The game ends when **no player** can place any more of their pieces.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - Each player counts the **number of triangle segments** in their **unplayed pieces**.  
  - Each segment = 1 point.  
  - **Lowest score wins**.  
- **Tournament Bonus (Optional Rule)**:  
  - A player who plays **all 22 pieces** earns a bonus:  
    - **–15 points** if the **single-triangle piece** is played **last**.  
    - **–10 points** if all pieces are played but the last piece is **not** the single.  
  - Bonus applies per game and can be earned multiple times in a tournament.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I touch my own piece on a corner and a side in the same placement?**  
  No. Only corner-to-corner contact is allowed with your own color. Any side or corner-to-side contact with your own piece is invalid.  
- **Can I place a piece that only touches an opponent’s piece?**  
  Yes, but only if it also touches **one of your own pieces** corner-to-corner. You cannot place a piece in isolation.  
- **Can I pass and then play again later?**  
  Technically yes if a later move becomes legal, but due to board congestion, this is rare. Most players pass permanently once they cannot move.  
- **What if two players finish all pieces and one cannot?**  
  Play continues until the remaining player can no longer move. Then scoring occurs.  
- **Are rotations and reflections of pieces allowed?**  
  Yes. Players may rotate or flip any piece to fit it on the board, as long as it aligns with the grid.
