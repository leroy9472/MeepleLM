## 5. Core Mechanics

### Stock Round Actions
A player may:
- Sell any number of shares
- Sell short one share of a 5- or 10-share company (if not already owning shares)
- Buy one share or start a new company via IPO auction
- Act for a company: take loans and/or buy back company shares

### Starting a Company (IPO)
- Select available company and open city (not Toronto).
- Auction President's Certificate: bids $100–$400 in $5 increments.
- Winner pays bid (cash and/or private companies at face value).
- Stock price = bid ÷ 2 (rounded down).
- Declare company size (2/5/10-share based on phase).
- 5-share company must buy 1 station ($50); 10-share must buy 3 stations ($150) before SR ends (loans allowed).

### Operating Round Sequence
1. Set interest rate (based on total loans).
2. Pay mail contracts (if company has train).
3. Companies operate in descending stock price order (Liquidation companies do not operate).
4. For each company:
   a. Lay or upgrade one track tile (pay $20 for second tile, max one upgrade)
   b. Place one station marker (if available)
   c. Run trains (routes may not begin/end at coal mines)
   d. Pay, half-pay, or withhold dividends
   e. Buy trains (from bank, other companies, or open market)
   f. Pay interest on loans (president covers if company cannot)
   g. Repay loans (only time loans cannot be taken)
5. Export top remaining train at end of OR.

### Merger & Acquisition Round
**Order of Operations:**
1. **Conversions & Mergers** (white area, in operating order)
2. **Liquidations** (red area, in reverse order of entry)
3. **Acquisitions** (grey area, reverse operating order)
4. **Friendly Sales** (white area, reverse operating order)

**Conversions:**

- Other players may buy one share or sell.
- 5-share must buy 1 station ($50); 10-share must buy 2 stations ($100) (max 8 total stations).
- Failure to buy stations → Liquidation.

**Mergers:**
- Two 2-shares → 5-share (2:1 share exchange).
- Two 5-shares → 10-share (1:1 share exchange).
- Combine assets; surviving company continues.
- New price: sum (5-share) or average rounded down (10-share).
