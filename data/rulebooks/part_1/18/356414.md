## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
**Objective**: In *Space Station Phoenix – SoloPlay*, you compete against a simulated opponent (SSP – SoloPlay System Player) to earn the most points by building your space station, managing resources, and acquiring aliens. The game ends when one of the following occurs:  
- You complete your station (build all 9 sectors),  
- Either you or SSP reaches 40+ points, or

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

Each round consists of the following sequence:

#### 1. Start of Round Maintenance  
- **Cycle Ship Column**:  
  - If your action marker is on a ship card, move the top card of that column to the bottom. Marker moves with the card.  
  - *Exception*: Skip if it’s the first action of the game or if your last action was income from a neutral ship.

- **Populate Ship Array with Resource Cubes**:  
  - Remove all cubes from ship cards.  
  - Draw cubes based on SSP’s current score:  
    - 0–9: 3 cubes  
    - 10–19: 4 cubes  
    - 20–29: 5 cubes  
    - 30+: 6 cubes  
  - Draw from a mix of 5 of each color (15 total).  
  - Place cubes on cards by column (based on color indicator), top to bottom.  
    - Only one cube per card.  
    - If more than 3 of a color are drawn, excess cubes cannot be placed.

- **SSP Scoring from Cube Placement**:  
  - 1 point per cube placed on a **facedown card**.  
  - 2 points per cube **not placed** (due to color overage).  
    - Example: 5 metal cubes drawn → 2 unplaced → SSP scores 4 points.

- **Diplomacy Advancements for SSP**:  
  - If 2+ cubes of a color are drawn, SSP may advance Diplomacy markers.  
  - For each column with **most cubes placed**:  
    - Identify the highest faceup card with a cube.  
    - If it’s a Diplomacy-type card (e.g., Farm, Ice, Diplomacy), advance the corresponding SSP Diplomacy marker 1 space.  
    - If not a Diplomacy card or is facedown, check the card above it (repeat if needed).  
  - **Scoring Notes**:  
    - If a Diplomacy track is full, SSP scores **2 points** instead of advancing.  
    - If no marker is advanced in a column with cubes, SSP scores **1 point per faceup card with a cube** in that column.

#### 2. Take Actions  
You may take actions until you choose to **Take Income**.

- **Move Action Marker**:  
  - Must move to a different ship card or neutral ship.  
  - Cannot act on the same card/ship as last income.

- **Pay Costs**:  
  - **Gem Cost**: Pay the gem cost on the ship card.  
  - **Owner Fee**: If the card has a cube, it’s “occupied” by SSP → pay the **additional gem cost** to SSP’s scoring area.  
  - **Movement Cost**:  
    - No cost if:  
      - Orthogonally adjacent to previous position  
      - Moving to/from neutral ship  
      - First action of the game  
    - Otherwise: Pay **1 gem per orthogonal step** (max 3 gems).

- **Mark Ship as Used**:  
  - Place a gem on the ship card or neutral ship → cannot be used again until income is taken.

- **Take Action** (per ship type):  
  - **Dismantle**:  
    - Only if ship is unused and has **no cube** on it.  
    - Flip card **facedown** (not removed). Gain metal as shown.  
  - **Construction**: Build a sector if you have metal.  
  - **Transport**: Trade resources for aliens or resources.  
  - **Expedition**: Roll dice, select results, gain resources or humans.  
  - **Diplomacy**: Pay to advance on a track.  
  - **Farm / Ice Collector**: Gain food or water.

- **Diplomacy Bonuses (after action)**:  
  - All players (you and SSP) gain bonuses based on track position.  
  - **SSP Bonuses**:  
    - Only gains gems or points.  
    - If SSP is leader at level 2: scores **1 point** instead of 2 gems.  
    - At level 4 (or 5 if not tied): scores **1 point + 2 gems**.

#### 3. Take Income (End of Round)  
Instead of taking another action, you may **Take Income**.

- **Do Not Move Action Marker**  
- **Collect Income**:  
  - From hub (e.g., 1 gem per ship)  
  - From occupied living quarters with **orange (income) bonus**

- **SSP Scoring**:  
  - Scores **1 point per action you took** this round (number of gems placed on ships).  
  - Gains aliens based on its current score:  
    - 0–4: 1 alien (gold only if no choice)  
    - 5–9: up to 2 colors  
    - 10–19: up to 3 colors  
    - 20+: no limit  
  - **Alien Selection Rule**:  
    - Prefers colors it has **fewest of** (including zero).  
    - You choose in case of tie.  
  - **Human Gain**:  
    - If SSP gains **1 alien** after reaching **5+ points**, it also takes **1 human**.  
    - If no humans, scores **1 point** instead.

- **Cleanup**:  
  - Remove all gems from ship cards and neutral ships.  
  - Return your neutral ship marker to your board **unless** you took income on a neutral ship (then leave it there → cannot use neutral ships next round).

#### 4. Check End Game Conditions  
End the game if:  
- You complete your station (all 9 sectors built)  
- You or SSP reaches **40+ points**  
- **4 or fewer aliens** remain in the supply  

If not, start a new round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

- **Ship Card Array**: Dynamic action selection grid. Cubes indicate “SSP occupation” → higher cost to use.  
- **Action Cost**: Combination of base gem cost, owner fee (to SSP), and movement cost.  
- **Dismantling**: Flip card facedown → removes from play until reset via income.  
- **Alien Acquisition**: Via Transport or Expedition actions. Must follow placement rules (color-matched quarters for aerobic aliens).  
- **Diplomacy Tracks**: Shared bonuses after certain actions. SSP gains points/gems based on position.  
- **SSP Behavior**: Fully deterministic: reacts to cube draws, your actions, and scoring thresholds.
