## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
During the Edo period, traders used higaki kaisen (trading ships) to transport goods from Osaka to Edo. As a trader, you manage the acquisition, transport, and sale of goods to earn Victory Points (VPs).  

**Objective**: Be the player with the most VPs at the end of the game. VPs are earned by selling goods when ships reach Edo. The game ends when any player has 8 or more Achievement tokens. In case of a tie in VPs, the player with more Achievement tokens wins. If still tied, all tied players win.

  - Card values: 11×"2", 9×"3", 7×"5" per color  
  - Each card has:  
    - **Value**: Coin value when spent

### 3. Setup  
1. Place board in center.  
2. Shuffle all cards into a face-down draw pile.  
3. Place Achievement tokens in supply, sorted by color.  
4. Place all 4 ships in Osaka.  
5. Draw 5 cards face-up to Market; 3 cards face-up to Farm.  
6. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
   - 1 Trader piece  
   - 1 Reservation piece  
7. Each player draws cards one at a time until total value ≥ 8. This forms their starting hand (kept secret; number of cards may be revealed).  
8. **Start player**: Player with lowest total value. Tiebreakers:  
   - Fewest cards  
   - Random if still tied  
9. Starting with start player and proceeding clockwise, each player takes 1 Achievement token of any color.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, choose **one** action:

#### A. Buy Goods  
- Spend cards from hand (as coins) to buy **all unreserved goods in Market** + **your reserved card** (if any).  
- Total coin value must be ≥ total value of goods being bought.  
- No change given; excess is lost.  
- Discard spent cards to discard pile.  
- Place bought goods face-up in front of you (organized by color = merchandise).  
- **Advance ships**:  
  - For each color of goods bought:  
    - 1 good → corresponding ship advances 1 space  
    - 2+ goods → ship advances 2 spaces  
- **If a ship reaches Edo**, immediately trigger **Payment Phase** (see below).  
- Return your Reservation piece if you bought your reserved card.

#### B. Take Coins  
- Take **1 unreserved card** from Market **or** your reserved card.  
- Add it to your hand (no hand limit).  
- Return your Reservation piece if you took your reserved card.

#### C. Reserve Cards  
- If you have your Reservation piece (i.e., not already used), place it on **1 unreserved card** in Market or Farm.  
- You may not reserve a card already reserved by another player.  
- Reserved card can only be taken or bought by you.  
- Reservation remains until:  
  - You take/buy it (you get piece back), or  
  - Market is refreshed (see below)

---

### 5. Refreshing Market and Farm  
**Trigger when**:  
- A player buys goods, OR  
- At start of a player’s turn, Market is empty or contains only others’ reserved cards  

**Refresh steps**:  
1. Move **all cards from Farm to Market** (reservations stay on cards).  
2. Draw **2 cards** to Market.  
3. Draw **3 cards** to Farm.  
- If draw pile is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new draw pile.

### 6. Payment (When Ship Reaches Edo)  
When one or more ships arrive in Edo, **resolve each separately**, starting with the active player’s ship (the one that triggered arrival). For each arriving ship:

#### 1. Scoring (Selling Goods)  
- All players **must sell all merchandise** of the arriving ship’s color.  
- For each player:  
  - Form a **set** of all goods of that color.  
  - **Base unit price** = highest card value in the set.  
  - **Add bonus**: +$1 per Achievement token you have of that color.  
  - **Total value** = (unit price) × (number of cards in set)  
  - **Round up** total to nearest multiple of 5.  
  - For every 5 points in rounded total, claim **1 card** as a VP (face-down under your Trader piece).  
  - Claim **lowest-value cards** first from the set.  
  - If not enough cards in set, draw from deck to fulfill VP claims.  
  - Discard any remaining goods in the set.

> Example: 3 green goods (5,3,2), highest = 5, you have 2 green tokens → unit price = 7. Total = 7×3 = 21 → rounds up to 25 → 5 VPs. Take 3 from set, 2 from draw pile.

#### 2. Acquire Achievement Tokens  
- For **each payment** in which you scored **at least 1 VP**, take **1 Achievement token** of the corresponding color.

#### 3. Sunk Ships (Black Tide)  
- Any ship on a wave space (Enshunada) is **sunk**.  
- All players **discard all merchandise** of that color **unless insured**.

#### 4. Insurance  
- Starting with active player, then clockwise, each player may:  
  - Discard a card with **Insurance icons** to protect goods.  
  - Each icon on discarded card insures **1 good** of the **same color** as the card.  
  - Mark insured goods by **rotating them 90°**.  
  - Insured goods are **not discarded** even if ship is sunk.  
  - Insured goods are **still sold** during payment.

#### 5. Return Ships  
- Ships that reached Edo return to **Osaka**.  
- Sunk ships return to **Anori** (anchor space).

### 7. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game ends immediately** after any player receives their **8th or more Achievement token** (during Step 2 of Payment).  
- Final scoring:  
  - Only VPs under Trader pieces count.  
  - Remaining goods, cards in hand, or unclaimed cards have **no value**.  
- **Winner**: Player with most VPs.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Most Achievement tokens  
  2. If still tied, all tied players win.

### 8. FAQ / Edge Cases  
- **Can I reserve a card in Farm?**  
  Yes, during Reserve action.  

- **Can I buy only part of Market?**  
  No. You must buy **all unreserved goods** and **your reserved card** if you buy.  

- **What if I can’t pay exactly?**  
  You may overpay, but no change. Underpayment is invalid.  

- **Can I insure goods of a color different from the card?**  
  No. Insurance only works for goods of the **same color** as the discarded card.  

- **Can I insure more than one good at a time?**  
  Yes, by discarding multiple cards or a card with multiple icons (e.g., a "2" card has 2 icons → insures 2 goods).  

- **Do Achievement tokens ever deplete?**  
  No. They are never spent, only acquired. Use substitutes if supply runs out.  

- **What if draw pile is empty during payment?**  
  Shuffle discard pile to form new draw pile, then continue.
