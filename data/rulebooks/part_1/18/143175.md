1. Lore & Objective  
In *Kashgar: Merchants of the Silk Road*, players take on the role of spice merchants building and managing three caravans along the Silk Road. The goal is to earn victory points (VP) by fulfilling Order cards and acquiring high-value Person cards. The game ends at the end of the round when any player reaches 25 or more VP.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Play proceeds clockwise starting with the first player.  
2. On a turn, a player must choose one of the following actions using the top card of any of their caravans:  
   a) **Caravan Action** (white box):  
      - Pay any listed cost (resource cost on left of dividing line).  
      - Perform the action.  
      - Place the used card at the back of its caravan.  
      - Any new cards acquired are placed at the back of the same caravan.  
   b) **Parting Action** (red box):  
      - Pay any listed cost.  
      - Perform the action.  
      - Remove the card from the game (return to box).  
      - Any new cards acquired are placed at the back of the same caravan.  
   c) **Pass**:  
      - Move the top card of a caravan to the back of that caravan.  
      - No action is performed.  
      - Cannot pass if the card has a "!" symbol (e.g., Patriarch, Matriarch, Gate Keeper).  
3. After the action, the next player takes their turn.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Caravans**: Each player has 3 caravans. Only the top card is active. Cards cycle from front to back when used (Caravan action or Pass). Parting actions remove the card permanently.  
- **Resources**:  
  - Gold and Spices: Max 9. Excess is lost.  
  - Mules: Max 6.  
- **Fulfilling Orders**:  
  - 4 face-up Order cards are always available.  
  - To fulfill an Order:  
    1. Must have at least the required number of Mules (shown on left). These are not spent.  
    2. Pay the cost (spices, gold, mules) shown at the bottom.  
    3. Take the Order card and place it face-up in front of you.  
    4. Draw a new Order card to refill the display to 4.  
  - Some actions allow fulfilling an Order **for free**, ignoring both Mule requirement and cost.  
- **Patriarch & Matriarch**:  
  - **Patriarch (front)**:  
    - Caravan Action 1: Draw 2 Standard cards, keep 1, discard the other.  
    - Caravan Action 2: Flip to Matriarch side, place at back.  
    - Must perform one action; cannot pass.  
  - **Matriarch (back)**:  
    - Caravan Action: Search Standard discard pile and take 1 card to back of caravan.  
    - Must perform action; cannot pass.  
- **Card Acquisition**:  
  - Standard cards: Discarded face-up to a common pile.  
  - Special and Order cards not kept: Returned to bottom of their decks.  
- **Special Card Types**:  
  - **Aristocrat**: Parting action allows starting a 4th caravan using the spare Patriarch.  
  - **Cup Bearer, Imposter, Gypsy, Noblewoman**: Allow removing cards from caravans (reducing size).  
  - **Farrier, Guild Lord**: Draw 3 Orders; fulfill up to 2 for free, return others under deck.  
  - **Scribe**: Fulfill a small contract for free (ignores Mule requirement and cost).  
  - **Maid**: Gain +1 Gold and +1 of a single spice per Patriarch (not Matriarch). All gains must be the same spice.  
  - **Village Beauty (Parting)**: All players must move their Patriarchs to the front of their caravans. Matriarchs unaffected.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory Points**:  
  - From fulfilled Order cards (value shown).  
  - From certain Person cards (e.g., Farmer: 1 VP per Wheat Field Order fulfilled).  
- **End Game Trigger**: When any player reaches 25 or more VP, the current round finishes (all players complete their turns).  
- **Final Scoring**: Sum VP from all fulfilled Orders and qualifying Person cards.  
- **Win Condition**: Player with the most VP wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: The tied player who most recently earned points wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **"!" Cards (Patriarch, Matriarch, Gate Keeper)**: Cannot be passed; must perform a Caravan or Parting action.  
- **Scribe and Free Orders**: “Fulfill for free” ignores both cost and Mule requirement.  
- **Maid’s Effect**: Can only gain one type of spice (plus Gold), even if multiple Patriarchs are present.  
- **Deck Runs Out**: Rules silent. Recommended: shuffle discard pile to form new deck when drawing Standard cards. For Special/Order cards, return unwanted cards to bottom of deck, so depletion is rare.  
- **Caravan Size Minimum**: No official rule, but house rule suggests minimum of 2 cards per caravan to prevent abuse of single-card engines.  
- **Farrier Balance**: Considered strong; house rule suggests increasing cost to +2 Mules.  
- **Early Order Access**: House rule: place 1 Spice Merchant per player in discard pile at start to ensure early access.
