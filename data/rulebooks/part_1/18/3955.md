# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Bang! is a Wild West-themed card game of hidden roles and deduction. Players take on roles such as Sheriff, Outlaws, Deputies, and Renegade, each with conflicting goals.

- **Sheriff**: Eliminate all Outlaws and the Renegade.
- **Deputies**: Assist the Sheriff; win when the Sheriff wins.
- **Outlaws**: Kill the Sheriff; win if the Sheriff is killed and the Renegade is not the sole survivor.
- **Renegade**: Be the last player alive.

## 2. Components
- Role cards (Sheriff, Deputies, Outlaws, Renegade)
- Character cards (with unique abilities and life points)
- Bullet tokens (to track life points)
- Playing cards (BANG!, Missed!, Beer, weapons, specials)
- Player boards (optional, for organization)

## 3. Setup
1. Determine number of players (4–7 recommended; 8 with Dodge City expansion).
2. Assign roles:
   - 4 players: 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 2 Outlaws
   - 5 players: 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 2 Outlaws, 1 Deputy
   - 6 players: 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 3 Outlaws, 1 Deputy
   - 7 players: 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 3 Outlaws, 2 Deputies
   - 8 players: 1 Sheriff, 2 Renegades, 3 Outlaws, 2 Deputies
3. Shuffle and deal one role card face down to each player. Sheriff reveals identity.
4. Shuffle character cards and deal one face up to each player. Announce character and ability.
5. Sheriff gains +1 life point (bullet).
6. Each player draws a starting hand equal to their current life points.
7. Place remaining cards in a draw pile; create discard pile nearby.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Play proceeds clockwise. Each turn has three phases:

1. **Draw 2 cards**  
   Draw two cards from the draw pile. If the pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

2. **Play any number of cards**  
   - Only one BANG! card may be played per turn unless ability or card allows otherwise.
   - Brown-bordered cards are played and discarded.
   - Blue-bordered cards (e.g., weapons, Mustang, Barrel) are played in front of you and remain in play.
   - Limit one copy of each card name in play per player.
   - Weapons: Only one in play at a time; discard old when playing new.

3. **Discard excess cards**  
   Discard down to hand size equal to current life points.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Distance**: Minimum number of seats between players clockwise or counterclockwise. Default attack range is 1.
- **Weapons**: Increase attack range. Number in sight indicates max distance.
- **Mustang**: Other players see you at +1 distance.
- **Appaloosa (Scope)**: You see other players at -1 distance (minimum 1).
- **BANG!**: Play to attack a player within range. Target may cancel with a Missed! card.
- **Missed!**: Cancel one BANG! or similar attack.
- **Beer**: Regain 1 life point. Can be played on your turn or out of turn to avoid elimination (only if losing last life point).
- **Duel**: Challenge any player. Players alternate discarding BANG! cards. First unable to discard loses 1 life.
- **Indians!**: All other players must discard a BANG! or lose 1 life.
- **Gatling**: All other players must discard a Missed! or lose 1 life.
- **Jail**: Play on another player (not Sheriff). At start of their turn, they draw: Heart = escape, else skip turn.
- **Dynamite**: Play on yourself. At start of next turn, draw: 2–9♠ = explode (lose 3 life), else pass to next player.
- **Barrel**: When targeted by BANG!, draw: Heart = cancel hit.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends when:
- **A) Sheriff is killed**:
