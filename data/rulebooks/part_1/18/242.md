## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Junta*, players represent powerful families in a fictional banana republic, vying for control and wealth through political manipulation, bribery, assassination, and coups. The goal is to amass the most money in your Swiss Bank Account by the end of the game.

The game ends immediately when there are fewer than 8 money cards available for the President to draw. The player with the most money in their Swiss Bank Account wins.

### 2. Components
- Political Cards (Influence, Event, Vote, Bribe, Assassin, Donation)
- Cabinet Position Cards (President, Minister of Internal Security, Generals, Admiral, Air Force Commander, Secretary of War, Foreign Secretary, Labor Secretary)
- Money Cards (Foreign Aid and Domestic Income)
- Unit Counters (Palace Guard, Army Brigades, Police, Gunboat, Marines, Paratroops, Airstrikes, Special Bodyguard, and various rebel units)
- Location Markers (for tracking player whereabouts)
- Swiss Bank Account and Cash On-Hand tracking
- Coup Excuse Marker
- Bank Is Safe / Closed For Lunch markers
- Prez’s Cousin and Bodyguard markers

### 3. Setup
- Each player draws 5 political cards to start.

  - Palace Guard in Palace
  - 1st, 2nd, 3rd Army Brigades in their respective Barracks
  - Police in Police Station
  - Gunboat in Docks
  - Marines in Marine Barracks
  - Paratroops and Airstrikes off-map
- Shuffle money decks (Foreign Aid and Domestic Income) and place within reach.
- Set Coup Excuse marker to “No Excuse.”

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn follows this sequence:

**1. Draw Political Cards**  
Each family draws 2 political cards. Maximum hand size is 6 cards (including face-up Influence cards).

**2. Assign Cabinet Positions**  
The President assigns all cabinet roles under these constraints:
- Each family must receive at least one position.
- The President cannot hold a second position.
- No family may control more than one General.
- No family may hold more than two cabinet positions.
- The President must assign all Brigade Generals and the Minister of Internal Security.

**3. Budget Phase**
- President draws 8 money cards (4 Foreign Aid, 4 Domestic Income — or more/less depending on Foreign/Labor Secretaries).
- President proposes how to distribute the funds.
- Roll call vote is held in two rounds:
  - Voting order: clockwise from President.
  - Each cabinet position and eligible card contributes votes.
  - President breaks ties.
- **If budget passes**: Funds are distributed as proposed. Proceed to location phase.
- **If budget fails**:
  - Minister of Internal Security may force passage:
    - Place all Police units in Chamber of Deputies.
    - Funds distributed as proposed.
    - Bank is “Closed for Lunch” — no banking this phase.
    - Coup Excuse triggered.
  - If Minister declines, President keeps all money. No banking occurs. Coup Excuse triggered.

**4. Location Choice**
Each player secretly chooses a location:
- Options: Palace, Bank, Headquarters, Home, Mistress, Nightclub, Cathedral, Market, University, Wealthy Neighborhood, Slum, Docks, Embassy.
- A player may choose to go into exile by placing their marker in a Foreign Embassy.
- The President may resign to go into exile.

**5. Assassinations**
- Minister of Internal Security declares first (1 free attempt).
- Other players (clockwise from Minister) may declare attempts using Assassin cards.
- Each attempt must specify target and location.
- The Minister cannot target the Bank two turns in a row (use “Bank Is Safe” marker).
- Resolution: clockwise from Minister.
  - Success: target loses all cards and cash, is eliminated for the turn. Assassin gains target’s cash.
  - Failure: no effect (unless card specifies otherwise).
  - If assassin dies before resolution, assassination fails.
- Any successful assassination triggers a Coup Excuse.

**6. Banking**
- Players present at the Bank may transfer money between Cash On-Hand and Swiss Bank Account.
- If budget failed and Minister did not force it, banking is skipped.
- If budget failed and Minister forced it, banking occurs after Coup phase.

**7. Coup Phase (if Coup Excuse exists)**
A Coup Excuse occurs if:
- Budget failed
- Minister forced budget
- Any successful assassination
- A “Coup Excuse” card was played

**Initiating a Coup:**
- Any player in HQ or with a Coup Excuse may start a coup by:
  - Moving a unit
  - Announcing bombardment of the Palace
  - Playing a card that places new units on the map (red units)

**Coup Structure:**
- 7 phases: 1 Rebel-Only round, then 6 regular rounds.
- First player to act becomes First Rebel.
- All others are Loyalists unless they act.
- President is always Loyalist.

**Movement:**
- One stack per player per phase may move to an adjacent area.
- First mover rotates clockwise each phase.
- Paratroops and Marines may land and move in same phase.
- Units may be transferred to another player during movement.

**Combat:**
- After movement, combat occurs in contested areas (not Embassies).
- Declare fire order: clockwise from President.
- Three volleys per combat:
  - Gunboat (3 dice) and Airstrikes (6 dice) fire before first volley.
  - Each unit rolls 1 die per full strength (round up). Palace Guard in Palace roll 2 dice.
  - Hits on 6. Each hit destroys one unit (defender chooses which).
- After three volleys, side with fewer losses stays. Loser retreats to adjacent area (must be empty or have owner’s permission). No retreat = destruction.

**8. Coup Aftermath**
- Starting with First Rebel, each player declares “Pro-Junata” or “Pro-President.”
- President must declare Pro-President.
- An area is Pro-President if:
  - Unoccupied
  - Contains any Pro-President unit
- Otherwise, it is Pro-Rebel.
- Control 3+ of 5 red target areas (Palace, Chamber of Deputies, Bank, Cathedral, Docks) to win the coup.

**Outcomes:**
- **Loyalist Victory**: President may send one Rebel (not in exile) to the Firing Squad. Victim’s cash goes to President.
- **Rebel Victory**: All Rebels vote for new President (one vote each). First Rebel breaks ties. New President may send one player (not in exile) to the Firing Squad. Cash goes to new President.
