## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players build a 3D structure using uniquely shaped pieces in their chosen color. The goal is to maximize the number of squares of their color visible from above when the game ends. Players also aim to place all their pieces to avoid point penalties. The player with the highest score wins.

2. Components  
- 1 turntable  
- 1 game board (mask): four available (A, B, C, D), chosen at setup  
- 4 sets of 11 plastic 3D pieces (each set in a distinct color: red, blue, yellow, green)  
- Total: 44 pieces  

3. Setup  
- Place the turntable on a flat surface.  
- Select one of the four masks (A, B, C, or D) and place it in the center of the turntable.  
- Each player chooses a color and takes all 11 pieces of that color.  
- Determine the first player (no specific method provided).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
- The game proceeds in turns, clockwise.  
- **Round 1 (Initial Placement):**  
  1. The first player places one piece anywhere on the game board, fully within the mask’s perimeter.  
  2. Each subsequent player places one piece such that it is adjacent (shares a face) with at least one already-placed piece.  
- **Round 2 and Beyond:**  
  - On a player’s turn, they must place one piece of their color.  
  - The placed piece must be adjacent on at least one full face to a piece of their own color already in play.  
  - It may also touch pieces of other players.  
  - Players continue in clockwise order.  
- **End of Play:**  
  - A player unable to place a piece on their turn is eliminated from further play.  
  - The game ends when all players are unable to place any more pieces on their respective turns.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Placement Rules:**  
  - All pieces must be placed from above.  
  - No part of a piece may extend beyond the mask’s perimeter.  
  - No piece may "overhang" — all parts of a piece must be supported from directly below (by the board or another piece).  
  - No gaps, holes, or tunnels may be created that cannot be filled by future pieces placed from above.  
- **Height Restrictions:**  
  - The mask defines a maximum height limit per square.  
  - An overall height restriction is also imposed based on the number of players, which may override local square limits.  
- **Adjacency:**  
  - First round: must touch any existing piece (any color).  
  - Subsequent rounds: must touch at least one face of a piece of the player’s own color.  
- **Turn Order:**  
  - Players take one turn per round until they can no longer place a piece.  
  - Players may not pass if a legal move is available.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when all players are unable to place any more pieces.  
- **Scoring:**  
  - Each player scores +1 point for every square of their color visible from directly above.  
  - Each player loses −1 point for each of their unplayed pieces.  
- **Winning:**  
  - The player with the highest total score wins.  
  - In case of a tie, no tiebreaker is specified.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a piece touch only an opponent’s piece in round 2+?**  
  No. In round 2 and beyond, a piece must be adjacent to at least one of the player’s own previously placed pieces. Touching only opponent pieces is invalid.  
- **What constitutes “visible from above”?**  
  Only the top-facing squares that are not obstructed by any higher piece (of any color) count. Overlapping or shadowed squares do not score.  
- **Can you place a piece that creates a cavity?**  
  No. Players may not create gaps, holes, or tunnels that cannot be filled from above in future turns. All voids must remain accessible from the top.  
- **Are height limits per square or overall?**  
  Both: individual squares on the mask may have specific height limits, and the number of players determines a global maximum height that may further restrict building.
