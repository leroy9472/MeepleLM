## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Dynasties*, two players take on the roles of rival warlords in ancient China, drawing inspiration from legendary generals like Sun Tzu and King Shao. The game simulates strategic territorial control across five provinces during nine dynastic turns. The objective is to gain control of provinces at key scoring intervals (3rd, 6th, and 9th turns) and manipulate the scoring track to secure victory.

Victory is achieved either by moving the scoring marker completely to your side of the track at any time, or by having the marker on your side after the final (9th) turn. In case of a tie on the scoring track, the player with more armies in reserve wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board showing five provinces: Xinjiang, Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, and Mandarin  
- 2 decks of Action cards (light and dark, one per player)  
- 8 Warlord cards (3 Sun Tzu cards for white, 3 King Shao cards for black, 2 extras)  
- 42 cubes (21 white, 21 black) representing armies  
- 9 scoring tiles (each with three values: 3rd, 6th, and 9th turn points)  
- 1 large pawn (tracks current Dynasty/turn)  
- 1 small pawn (tracks score difference on scoring track)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board centrally. Randomly select 5 of the 9 scoring tiles and place one below each province name on the side of the board. Discard the remaining 4 tiles.  
2. Each player chooses a color (white or black). The white player takes the light-colored deck; the black player takes the dark deck. Each takes 21 cubes in their color.  
3. Place the large pawn on "1" (start of Dynasty 1). Place the small scoring pawn on the middle (green) space of the scoring track.  
4. Each player takes the six yellow-numbered Action cards (1–6) into hand. Shuffle the remaining cards in their deck and draw 4 additional cards.  
5. **Variants (optional):**  
   - *Basic Game:* Use only cards 1–10, +1, –1, Plague; remove +2, +3, and Warlord cards. Start with 21 armies.  
   - *Expert Game:* Include +2 and +3 cards. Start with 18 armies. Players may discard a white-numbered or Plague card from hand to draw 1 extra army (from the 3 set aside).  
   - *Warlord Variant:* Each player selects one of their three Warlord cards (Sun Tzu or King Shao) to keep; discard the other two. This card may be played once during the game.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each Dynasty (turn) proceeds in the following phases:

#### Phase 1: Card Deployment  
Each player secretly places one Action card face down beside each of the five provinces on their side of the board.

#### Phase 2: Card Reveal Order  
- **First Dynasty:** Reveal cards in fixed order from Xinjiang to Mandarin (left to right or right to left depending on player position).  
- **Subsequent Dynasties:** The player with **fewer armies on the board** chooses the reveal order.  
  - In case of a tie, the player who chose last retains the right.  
  - If no one has yet chosen, continue using the first-turn order.

#### Phase 3: Resolve Battles  
For each province, reveal cards simultaneously and resolve combat:

| Card Played | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Numbered 1–10 | Higher number wins by difference. Winner removes opponent’s armies first, then places own armies equal to the difference. |
| +1 | Equals opponent’s card +1. Max difference = 1. |
| –1 | Equals opponent’s card –1. Max difference = 1. |
| +1 vs –1 | +1 wins; difference = 1 in favor of +1 player. |
| +1 vs +1 or –1 vs –1 | Cancel out; no change. |
| 6 | Must mark the province with a cube (from reserve or any controlled province). This marks that the player has used a “6” in that province. Can only be used once per province per player. |
| Plague | Cancels combat. Armies in the province are reduced by half (rounded down). A single army cannot be eliminated — at least one remains. |
| +2 | Acts like +1 but player must permanently remove 1 army from the game. |
| +3 | Acts like +1 but player must permanently remove 2 armies from the game. |

**Army Placement Rules:**  
- Winner must place armies equal to the net difference after removing enemy armies.  
- If insufficient armies in reserve, player must move armies from adjacent (bordering) provinces.  
- If no adjacent armies available, move from any controlled provinces, starting with adjacent ones.

#### Phase 4: Post-Combat  
After all five provinces are resolved:  
- Return all **yellow-numbered (1–6)** cards to hand.  
- Remove all **white-numbered (7–10, +1, –1, Plague, +2, +3)** cards played this turn from the game (discard permanently).  
- Draw 2 cards from deck: choose 1 to add to hand, place the other on the bottom of the deck.  
  - *Exception:* If a player played their "1" card in the previous turn, they draw 3 cards and add 2 to hand.  
- Advance large pawn to next Dynasty.  
- After 3rd, 6th, and 9th turns: conduct scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Scoring Tiles  
Each tile shows three values:  
- First number: VP value at end of **3rd Dynasty**  
- Second number: VP value at end of **6th Dynasty**  
- Third number: VP value at end of **9th Dynasty**  

Example: A "2–3–5" tile awards 2 points on turn 3, 3 on turn 6, and 5 on turn 9.

#### Scoring Procedure  
At the end of turns 3, 6, and 9:  
- For each province, the player with **at least one cube** controls it and scores the corresponding VP value.  
- Sum total points for each player.  
- Compute **difference** in scores.  
- Move the small scoring pawn that many spaces toward the higher-scoring player.

#### Victory Conditions  
- **Immediate Win:** If at any time the scoring pawn reaches the red space on a player’s side, that player wins immediately.  
- **Final Win (after 9 turns):** Player whose side the scoring pawn is on wins.  
- **Tiebreaker:** If the pawn is in the center, the player with more armies in reserve wins.

#### Warlord Cards (Optional Variant)  

**Sun Tzu (White) Cards – Choose One:**  
- Place 1 additional army in any province you control.  
- Remove 1 enemy army from any province (during first 6 turns).  
- When playing 7–10, declare it as a “6” instead (does not use 6-marking; can still play 6 later).  
- Move 1 of your armies to a neighboring province (during first 6 turns).

**King Shao (Black) Cards – Choose One:**  
- Begin game with scoring pawn 1 space toward your side.  
- Play your “6” twice in one province (must mark with second cube).  
- Cause Plague to reduce a province to **exactly 1 army** (even if only one was present).  
- Remove 1 enemy army from any province (during first 6 turns).

> Warlord cards are played **once per game**, at any time (before or after battles, but not during), unless otherwise restricted.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Scoring occurs at the end of **Turns 3, 6, and 9**.  
- After scoring, move the scoring pawn by the **point difference** between players.  
- Game ends:  
  - Immediately if scoring pawn reaches a red end zone.  
  - Otherwise, after Turn 9.  
- Final winner:  
  - Player with scoring pawn on their side.  
  - If tied (center), player with more reserve armies wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: What if I can’t place all armies due to reserve shortage?**  
A: You must take armies from the board — starting with adjacent provinces you control. If none adjacent, take from any controlled province.

**Q: Can I use a +1 or –1 against a Plague?**  
A: No — Plague takes precedence and cancels the combat entirely. No card comparison occurs.

**Q: Can I play a “6” in a province where I have no presence?**  
A: Yes. You must place a cube to mark it, either from reserve or by taking from another province.

**Q: Does playing a “6” trigger army placement?**  
A: No. Playing a “6” only requires marking the province. Combat outcome is resolved separately.

**Q: Can I play my Warlord card during combat?**  
A: No. Warlord actions may be played **before or after** a battle, but not during resolution.

**Q: What happens if both players play Plague?**  
A: Combat is canceled. Apply Plague effect once: reduce armies by half, rounded down (minimum 1).

**Q: Can I discard a +2 or +3 to gain an army in Expert Game?**  
A: No. Only white-numbered (7–10) or Plague cards can be discarded for an extra army.
