## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Terra Nova, players represent factions expanding across a shared landscape by terraforming terrain, building settlements, and establishing trade dominance. The goal is to score the most victory points (VP) over 5 rounds through strategic expansion, town founding, sailing progression, bonus tiles, and end-game scoring.

2. Components  
- Game board (2–4 player side)  
- 8 round scoring tiles (5 used per game)  
- 6 power actions (marked with X-tokens at start)  
- Money (coins)  
- Terrain tiles  
- Bonus tiles  
- Player faction mats (with sides A and B)  
- Faction tokens  
- Power tokens (8 per player: 2 in Bowl I, 2 in Bowl II, 4 in Bowl III)  
- Houses (8 per player), trading posts (4), palaces (2), bridges (3), town tiles (4)  
- Player aids  
- First player token  
- Turn order mat (for variant)

3. Setup  
- Place board on 2–4 player side.  
- Shuffle 8 round scoring tiles; place 5 face-up on round spaces.  
- Place an X-token next to each of the 6 power actions.  
- Place money and terrain tiles near the board.  
- Shuffle bonus tiles; place (number of players + 3) face-up. Return the rest to the box.  
- Randomly assign first player token (or use dropout variant).  
- In clockwise order, each player selects a faction.  
- Place one faction token on the 0 space of the point track.  

Player Setup:  
- Choose side A (recommended for beginners) or B of faction mat.  
- Take starting money shown in top-left of mat.  
- Take 8 power tokens: place 2 in Bowl I, 2 in Bowl II, 4 in Bowl III.  
- Place 1 faction token on 0 space of sailing track.  
- Place 8 hours, 4 trading posts, 2 palaces on matching spaces of faction mat.  
- Place 3 bridges and 4 town tiles beside mat.  
- Take matching player aid.  
- In turn order, each player places one house on a terrain matching their color. Then repeat in reverse order.  
- In reverse order, each player chooses one bonus tile and places it face-up.  
- Place 1 coin on each of the 3 remaining unchosen bonus tiles.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has three phases:  
1. **Income Phase**  
   - All players gain income (money and/or power) from their faction mat and bonus tile.  
   - To gain power:  
     - First, move all power from Bowl I → Bowl II.  
     - Then, move all power from Bowl II → Bowl III.  
     - If all power is already in Bowl III, no additional power is gained.  
   - Spending power:  
     - Power can only be spent from Bowl III.  
     - Spend power to use power actions or convert to 1 coin per power spent.  
     - After spending, move spent power tokens to Bowl I.

2. **Action Phase**  
Players take turns performing one action until all drop out. On your turn, choose one of the following 7 actions:  

- **Terraform and Build**  
  - Target hex must be adjacent to your building or reachable via river within your sailing value.  
  - If terrain ≠ home terrain: pay 6 coins per shovel (count shovels between terrains on mat).  
  - Place your terrain tile.  
  - Optionally build a house: pay 4 coins, place leftmost house on hex. Return used house to rightmost open slot on mat.  

- **Upgrade a Building**  
  - House → Trading Post:  
    - Adjacent to opponent’s building: pay 7 coins.  
    - Not adjacent: pay 10 coins.  
    - Replace house with leftmost trading post; return house to mat.  
  - Trading Post → Palace: pay 14 coins. Choose which palace to place.  

- **Increase Sailing**  
  - Pay 8 coins. Move 1 space forward on sailing track. Gain immediate VP (amount not specified in source).  
  - Higher sailing value = more river spaces can be crossed to reach build sites.  

- **Build a Bridge**  
  - Pay 10 coins. Place bridge on a river hex adjacent to your building.  
  - The hex on the other side of the bridge is now considered adjacent.  
  - Max 3 bridges per player.  

- **Power Actions** (Orange octagons)  
  - 6 available on board; each can be used once per round.  
  - Spend power from Bowl III to activate.  
  - Examples:  
    - Single Shovel: Terraform one hex. May pay 6 coins for second shovel.  
    - Double Shovel: Terraform two separate hexes (each adjacent to your building). Can only build on one. Cannot buy extra shovels.  
  - Remove X-token after use.  

- **Special Actions**  
  - Found on bonus tiles or palaces.  
  - Function like power actions but cost no power.  

- **Drop Out of the Round**  
  - First player to drop out takes the first player token.  
  - Trigger all closed scroll (📜) icons on your bonus tile, mat, or palace.  
  - Exchange current bonus tile for a new one (cannot keep same).  
  - Flip new bonus tile face-down to indicate dropout.  
  - Once all players drop out, round ends.  

Free Action:  
- On your turn, you may spend any amount of power from Bowl III to gain 1 coin per power spent (in addition to main action).

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Adjacency**: Hexes share an edge. Bridges extend adjacency across rivers.  
- **Terraforming Rules**:  
  - Must fully transform terrain to match your home terrain.  
  - Cannot partially terraform (e.g., green → red → yellow). Must go directly to home terrain.  
- **Power Flow**:  
  - Gain: Bowl III ← Bowl II ← Bowl I (in sequence).  
  - Spend: Only from Bowl III → Bowl I.  
- **Town Founding**:  
  - Triggered when 4 adjacent buildings have combined town value ≥7.  
    - House = 1, Trading Post = 2, Palace = 3.  
  - Claim one town tile, gain its bonus, place face-down on one building.  
  - New buildings adjacent to existing towns join the town; do not trigger new town founding.  
  - Sailing > 0 allows building across rivers to form new towns.  
- **Power Gain from Others**:  
  - When a player builds or upgrades a building, all adjacent opponents gain 1 power per adjacent building they own.  
  - You do not gain power from your own actions.  
  - Players who have dropped out still gain power this way.

6. Scoring & End Game  
After 5 rounds:  
- **Round Scoring**: After each round, flip scoring tile face-down (no mid-game scoring detailed).  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - Money: 1 VP per 3 coins (round down).  
  - Connected Buildings:  
    - Count largest group of mutually reachable buildings (via adjacency or bridges).  
    - 1st place: 12 VP, 2nd: 8 VP, 3rd: 4 VP.  
    - Ties: Combine VP values and divide equally among tied players.  
  - Bonus Tiles: Score bonuses as per tile effects (not detailed in source).  
  - Sailing Track: VP gained when increasing sailing (amount not specified).  
  - Towns: Bonuses from town tiles (not specified in source).  
- Winner: Highest total VP. Ties are shared.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I spend power if Bowls I or II have tokens?**  
  Yes. You can spend from Bowl III regardless of Bowl I/II status.

  - First to drop out gains start player token.
