## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
**Objective**: The goal of *Ride the Rails* is to earn the most money over six rounds by strategically acquiring shares in railroads, building track networks, and transporting passengers across the United States. Players earn money through dividends from railroad usage, track-building bonuses, and passenger transport rewards.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Game Board (U.S. map with cities, routes, and tracking charts)  
- 5 Player Boards  
- 162 Locomotives (27 each in 6 colors: Red, Blue, Orange, Yellow, Purple, Black)  
- 52 Wooden Passengers  
- 6 Tracker Disks (one per railroad color)  
- 1 Hexagonal Tracker  
- 15 Player Disks (3 per player: 2 for money tracking, 1 for turn order)  
- 1 Round Marker  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Place one Passenger on each city hex.  
3. Place the 6 colored Tracker Disks and the white Hexagonal Tracker on their starting positions on the counting chart (colored disks at 0, hexagon at 1).  
4. Place all locomotives in a supply near the board.  
5. Each player chooses a color and takes:
   - Their player board
   - 3 player disks (2 for money, 1 for turn order)
6. Each player places:
   - One disk on the $0 space of both the 1s and 100s money tracks
   - One disk on a random space of the turn order track
7. Place the Round Marker on Round 1.
8. Only Red and Blue locomotives are available for Round 1.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has 3 phases:

#### PHASE 1: Take a Share (Reverse Turn Order)  
- Each player takes one locomotive from the available supply and places it in the leftmost empty space on the matching railroad on their player board.  
- This grants a Share in that railroad, enabling:
  - Building its tracks
  - Receiving dividends when its links are used  
- Available railroads per round:
  - Round 1: Red, Blue
  - Round 2: + Orange
  - Round 3: + Yellow
  - Round 4: + Purple
  - Round 5: + Black
  - Round 6: No new railroads

#### PHASE 2: Build Railroad Track (Normal Turn Order)  
- Players take turns placing locomotives on the board.  
- Maximum placements per player:
  - 3 players: 8 (7 if building in mountains)
  - 4 players: 5 (4 if building in mountains)
  - 5 players: 4 (3 if building in mountains)
- **Mountain Penalty**: Building in any mountain hex reduces total allowed placements by 1 (only once per turn).  
- Cannot place last remaining locomotive on a mountain if it would violate the reduced limit.  
- Must own at least one Share in a railroad to build its tracks.  
- Can build multiple railroads per turn, within share ownership and placement limits.

##### Placement Rules  
- **First locomotive of a railroad** must be placed in a city displaying its color (exceptions below).  
- **Subsequent locomotives** must be adjacent to an existing locomotive of the same railroad.  
- **One locomotive per railroad per hex**.  
- **Maximum two locomotives per hex**, except:
  - **Chicago**: Unlimited locomotives
- **Multi-colored East Coast cities** (6 total): Maximum one locomotive total (any color), and any railroad may occupy up to two of these.

##### Railroad Starting Rules  
- **Red & Blue (Round 1)**: Must start in one of the 6 multi-colored East Coast cities; cannot start in the same city.  
- **Orange (Round 2)**: Can start in any multi-colored East Coast city or Chicago.  
- **Yellow (Round 3)**: Can start in Chicago or one of the **three westernmost cities with exactly one locomotive**.  
  - If Chicago has exactly one locomotive and is among the three westernmost, only three choices.  
  - If four cities tie for westernmost, player may choose from all four or Chicago (five choices).  
- **Purple (Round 4)**: Must start in one of the four Purple/Black West Coast cities.  
- **Black (Round 5)**: Can start in any city with fewer than 2 locomotives, or in Chicago.  
  - Note: Multi-colored East Coast cities can hold only one locomotive, so Black cannot start there unless empty.

##### Building Bonuses  
- **Chicago Bonus**: $2 immediately when placing any track in Chicago (including first placement).  
- **$5 Cities Bonus**: First player to build into one of the four green $5 cities earns $5. No bonus if starting there or if another player already built there.  
- **Transcontinental Bonus**: $12 if connection is made in a **city hex**, $8 if in a **rural hex**.  
  - Paid only once, to the player who makes the final connecting placement.  
  - Connection must link a West Coast Purple/Black city to an East Coast multi-colored city via a chain of different railroads.  
  - Only the **final placement** determines bonus value.  
  - Rural hexes in the route are allowed; passengers cannot ride through them, but bonus is still paid.  
  - Sequential placement matters: player can control bonus by placing rural connection first, city connection second.

#### PHASE 3: Ride the Rails (Normal Turn Order)  
- Each player transports one Passenger from their current city to another city.  
- Must trace a valid route using **Links**, where a Link is a continuous path of same-color locomotives between two cities.  
- Route may use multiple railroads and pass through multiple cities.  
- No loops: each hex visited only once.  
- Active player chooses which railroad’s Link to use if multiple same-color links exist between cities.  
- **Dividends**: Each railroad used pays $1 per Link used to every player for each Share they own in that railroad.  
- **Passenger Reward**: Active player earns dollars equal to **number of Links + 1**, which equals the number of cities visited (start + intermediate + end).  

##### Tracking Method (Heavy Cardboard Method)  
- Instead of paying dividends immediately, **accumulate totals** across all players’ rides:
  - Leave Tracker Disks on the chart to record total Links used per railroad.
  - Reset Hexagonal Tracker to 1 at the start of the phase.
- After all players have ridden:
  - Pay dividends based on **total accumulated Links per railroad**.
  - Each player receives $1 per Share × total Links for each railroad.
- Reset all Tracker Disks to 0 and Hexagonal Tracker to 1 after payouts.

##### Edge Cases  
- If no Passenger has a valid route, player skips the phase.  
- Passenger can start and end in same city only if a valid non-looping route exists (e.g., via detour).  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Shares**: Acquired in Phase 1; determine building rights and dividend eligibility.  
- **Track Building**: Limited by player count and mountain penalties; governed by adjacency and city rules.  
- **Route Tracing**: Uses Links (same-color continuous paths); players choose path and railroad usage.  
- **Dividends**: Based on number of Links used per railroad, paid per Share.  
- **Bonus Triggers**: Immediate upon qualifying placement (Chicago, $5 cities, Transcontinental).  
- **Turn Order Adjustment**: After each round, players reorder by money (lowest to highest). Ties: swap positions.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Ongoing Scoring**:
  - Money earned from:
    - Building bonuses (Chicago, $5 cities, Transcontinental)
    - Dividends (per Share × Links used)
    - Passenger transport (Links + 1)
- **Final Scoring**: After Round 6.
  - Player with most money wins.
  - Ties are possible.
- **Money Tracking**:
  - Use two disks per player: 1s track (0–99) and 100s track.
  - If over $100, place second disk on 100s track.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q**: Can I use a railroad I don’t have a Share in?  
  **A**: Yes, to ride passengers. But you only earn dividends from railroads you have Shares in.  

- **Q**: Can two railroads start in the same city?  
  **A**: Yes, except Red and Blue in Round 1—they must start in different East Coast cities.  

- **Q**: Can I build multiple tracks in mountain hexes?  
  **A**: Yes, but total placements reduced by 1 regardless of number of mountain hexes.  

- **Q**: Does the Transcontinental bonus require a passenger to be able to ride it?  
  **A**: No. Bonus is paid based on connection, even if route includes rural transfers (which block passenger travel).  

- **Q**: Can a railroad start in a city not showing its color?  
  **A**: Only if allowed by special rules (e.g., Yellow in western cities, Black in low-occupancy cities). Normally, must start in a city showing its color.  

- **Q**: What if no valid passenger route exists?  
  **A**: Player skips the Ride the Rails phase. Board state unchanged.
