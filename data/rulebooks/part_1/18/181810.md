## Kodama: The Tree Spirits — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The forest is growing, and as caretakers of the Kodama—tree spirits—you must cultivate a lush, harmonious tree over three seasons. The goal is to score the most points (denoted by $\clubsuit$) by strategically placing branch cards to form contiguous lines with matching icons and fulfilling the conditions of Kodama cards. The player whose tree best satisfies the spirits wins lasting honor.

### 2. Components  
- 65 Branch cards  
- 20 Kodama cards  
- 12 Decree cards (4 Spring, 4 Summer, 4 Fall)  
- 12 Player tokens (2 for each of 6 icons: caterpillar, cloud, firefly, flower, mushroom, star)  
- 1 Season token  
- 1 First player marker  
- 6 Trunk cards  
- 1 Score track  

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the score track in the center. Put the season token on “Spring.”  
2. Shuffle and deal one Trunk card to each player. Place it at your edge of the table, oriented so the tree grows toward the center.  
3. Place your two player tokens (matching the icon on your trunk) on the “0” spaces of the score track.  
4. Shuffle the Kodama deck and deal 4 cards to each player. These remain secret.  
5. Shuffle each season’s Decree cards (Spring, Summer, Fall) separately. Reveal one Decree card per season, placing them faceup beside the play area (only Spring’s is used initially).  
6. Return unused components (extra trunks, tokens, etc.) to the box.  
7. Shuffle all Branch cards to form a deck. Place it face down.  
8. Draw 3 Branch cards and place them faceup in the center to form the display.  
9. The player wearing the most green becomes first player and takes the first player marker.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **3 Seasons** (Spring, Summer, Fall). Each Season has three phases:  
1. **Decree Phase**  
2. **Growing Phase** (4 rounds)  
3. **Kodama Phase**

After Fall’s Kodama Phase, the game ends.

#### Decree Phase  
- Reveal the Decree card for the current season. Read it aloud. It sets a special rule for that season.  
- Discard the previous season’s Decree card at the start of a new season.

#### Growing Phase  
Each player takes **4 turns**, starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise. On your turn:

**Step 1: Play a Branch Card**  
- Choose one of the 3 faceup cards from the display.  
- Connect it to your tree by matching its extending branch to a branch on another card.  
  - The new card must touch **only one** existing card.  
  - The connection must be where the branch extends beyond the card edge.  
  - Must not cover any icons.  
  - Must not hang over the edge of the table.  
  - Cannot cause you to score more than **10 points this turn** (from Step 2 only; Decree points ignored).  
- Once placed, cards cannot be moved.

**Step 2: Score Points**  
After placing the card:  
- Look at the **icons on the card you just played**.  
- Score 1 point for **each instance** of those icons in a **contiguous line** from the new card down to the trunk.  
  - The line must follow connected branches.  
  - Scoring stops if an icon is missing on a card in the line.  
  - Scoring never “doubles back” at forks.  
  - Only icons in this continuous path count.  

> Example: You play a card with 2 fireflies. The path from this card to the trunk includes 3 other cards, with fireflies on 2 of them. You score 4 points (2 from new card, 1 each from two others).

**Step 3: Refill the Display**  
- Draw a card from the deck and place it faceup in the empty spot in the display.  
- If you are the **first player**, advance the season token to the next season after your turn (after 4th round of a season).

#### Kodama Phase  
After all 4 rounds of the Growing Phase:  
- In turn order, each player chooses **one** of their 4 Kodama cards to score.  
- Score points as described on the card (e.g., "Score 3 points for each flower in a contiguous line from the trunk").  
- Once scored, return the Kodama card to the box.  
- Pass the first player marker:  
  - Give it to the player with the **lowest score**.  
  - In case of a tie, give it to the tied player **closest to the left** of the current first player.

Repeat for Summer and Fall.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Branch Card Placement Rules  
- Must connect **branch-to-branch** (edge extension touching another card’s branch).  
- Only one card may be touched.  
- No covering icons.  
- No overhang.  
- Max **10 points per turn** from placement scoring (excluding Decree bonuses).  

#### Scoring Mechanics  
- Points come from two sources:  
  1. **Branch placement**: Score based on icons on the placed card and matching icons in the **contiguous path to the trunk**.  
  2. **Kodama cards**: Score once per season based on specific conditions (e.g., number of stars, longest branch line, etc.).  

- Scoring is **path-dependent**: only cards in the unbroken chain from the new card to the trunk count.  
- Icons not on the placed card are **ignored** for that turn’s scoring.  

#### Decree Cards  
- Season-specific special rules. Examples not provided in text, but must be followed during the relevant season.  
- Discarded at the start of the next season.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after the **third Kodama Phase** (end of Fall).  
- Each player will have played 3 Kodama cards and have **1 unused** in hand (not scored).  
- Final scores are compared on the score track.  
- The player with the **most points** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a card that doesn’t score?**  
  Yes. You may place any legal card, even if it scores 0 points.  

- **What if the display has duplicate cards?**  
  Allowed. Cards are refilled immediately after removal.  

- **Can I place a card that connects to my trunk?**  
  Yes. The trunk counts as a card. The branch must connect to an extending branch on the trunk card.  

- **Do I score for icons on the trunk?**  
  Yes, if they are in the contiguous path and match icons on the card you just played.  

- **What if I can’t legally place any card in the display?**  
  You must still take a card and attempt placement. If no legal placement exists, the rules do not specify—assume the player must pass or forfeit the turn (house rule may be needed).  

- **Can the same icon appear multiple times on one card?**  
  Yes. Each instance counts individually when scoring.
