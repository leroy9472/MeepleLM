- Shuffle the blue quest deck.
- Place the turn marker on space 1 of the turn track.
- Shuffle the event card deck.

2. **Actions**:
   - **Town Action**: Regain health/energy, buy/sell items, purchase power cards.
   - **Travel Action**: Draw a blue quest card; fight one or both creatures listed.
   - **Dungeon Action**: Enter and complete the dungeon.
   - **Overlord Action**: Fight the Overlord.
3. **Character Death**: A dead character is out until the next Town action, at which point they are automatically revived.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Actions**: Players follow a fixed action track. During Travel actions, draw from the blue quest deck and choose which creature(s) to fight.
- **Town Actions**: During a Town action, a character may:
  - Regain health and energy tokens equal to their level.
  - Sell or purchase item cards from the merchant deck.
  - Purchase power cards from their class deck.
- **Combat**:
  - Players may freely distribute damage among party members, up to their current health.
  - Combat follows the standard sequence: Attack Phase (Dice Pool, Reroll, Place Tokens), Defense Phase (Ranged Strike, Damage, Resolution).
- **Leveling**: After a Town action that includes leveling, characters gain 3/4 of the next level’s max health and energy and choose a talent.
- **Dungeons**: Enter and complete the dungeon as per standard rules. Only one action is allowed per turn while in a dungeon.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory**: Players win by defeating the Overlord during the final Overlord action.
- **Defeat**: If the Overlord is not defeated by the time the action track reaches the Overlord phase, the players lose.
- **No scoring system**: The game is binary—either the party defeats the Overlord or fails.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Damage Distribution**: Players may assign damage freely among characters, as long as no character receives more damage than their current health.
- **Character Death**: A character who dies is removed from play and returns automatically at the next Town action.
- **Dungeon Progression**: Dungeons must be completed in the order specified by the action track.
- **Item Management**: Players may buy and sell items during Town actions. Items can be stored in the bag (up to 3) or equipped.
- **Power Cards**: Players can purchase power cards during Town or Training actions and store them under the spellbook token.
