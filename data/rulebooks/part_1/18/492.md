## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the mystical lands of Persia and Arabia, heroes vie for magical artifacts within the Caliph’s palace. To gain entry and influence, players send citizens (represented by numbered tokens) to gather treasure from dragon caves, gain abilities in the city, and bribe or outwit the palace guard. The player who collects the most artifacts by the end of the game wins. Ties are broken by the number of Scroll artifacts held.

2. Components  
- Game board with 5 Dragon Caves (bottom), 4 City spaces (middle), and 6 Palace spaces (top: 1 Palace Guard + 5 Palace Rooms)  
- 5 Player Screens  
- 40 Tokens (8 per player in 5 colors; values: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 — no '3')  
- 10 Palace Guard Tokens (numbered 1–10)  
- 1 Camel Token  
- 30 Artifact Tiles (5 each of 6 types: Aladdin’s Lamp, Counterspell, Double, Flying Carpet, Key, Scroll)  
- Treasure Pieces: 5 types (crowns, pearls, gemstones, trophies, gold bars); 14 small (value 1) and 5 large (value 3) per type  
- 45 Treasure Cards (15 per player count: 3, 4, or 5 players)  
- 21 Magic Spell Cards  
- Rulebook and Summary Sheet  

3. Setup  
- Place board in center. Each player takes a screen and 8 tokens of one color, placing them face-up behind their screen.  
- Shuffle 10 Palace Guard tokens and place face-down near board.  
- Form treasury (bank) with all treasures. Each player takes 3 small treasures of any kind.  
- Youngest player takes camel and is starting player.  
- Artifact Setup (Magic Version):  
  - Remove one full set of 6 artifact types per player less than 5.  
  - Each player receives 1 Aladdin’s Lamp.  
  - Shuffle remaining artifacts into stacks of 5, place face-down above each palace room.  
  - Use only as many palace rooms as players (3 rooms for 3 players, etc.).  
- Treasure Cards: Use set matching player count (indicated on card back), shuffle, place face-down beside board.  
- Magic Spell Cards: Shuffle and place face-down near Aladdin’s Tent.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in phases:  
1. **Vizier Phase**  
   - Reveal top artifact in each palace room (if not already face-up).  
   - Reveal top Treasure Card; place indicated treasures in Dragon Caves (from treasury).  
   - Shuffle Palace Guard tokens and place one face-down in Palace Guard space.  

2. **Token Placement Phase**  
   - Starting with the start player and proceeding clockwise, each player places one token face-down on the board per turn.  
   - Players continue until all 8 tokens are placed.  
   - Valid placement spaces:  
     - Dragon Caves with at least one treasure  
     - Any of 4 City spaces (Aladdin’s Tent, Djinn’s House, Market, Caravanserai)  
     - Palace Guard space  
     - Palace Rooms with available artifacts  
   - Restrictions:  
     - No more than 5 tokens per player per Palace Room  
     - No tokens in empty Dragon Caves or inactive Palace Rooms  

3. **Tallying Phase** (in order: Dragon Caves → City → Palace Guard → Palace Rooms)  
   - Tally spaces one at a time. Only tokens in current space are revealed; others remain hidden.  
   - **Dragon Caves (left to right):**  
     - Reveal all tokens. Each player sums their token values.  
     - Highest total wins first shelf, second highest wins second shelf, etc.  
     - Number of shelves = number of players (max 4 or 5, depending on game size).  
     - Ties broken in player order (starting player first, then clockwise).  
     - Unclaimed treasures return to bank.  

   - **City (right to left):**  
     - Reveal tokens. Only strongest player gains benefit:  
       - **Aladdin’s Tent:** Draw 2 Spell Cards, keep 1, give 1 to second player (or discard if none).  
       - **Djinn’s House:** May use powers of two artifacts this round.  
       - **Market:** Exchange 1 small treasure for 3 small treasures (any type).  
       - **Caravanserai:** Choose new starting player; transfer camel.  
     - Ties broken in player order.  

   - **Palace Guard:**  
     - Reveal Palace Guard token.  
     - Each player reveals their token(s) here.  
     - To enter Palace, player’s total must ≥ Guard’s strength.  
     - If lower, may bribe with treasures equal to the difference.  
     - If unable or unwilling to bribe, player removes all Palace Room tokens and cannot participate in Palace scoring.  
     - **Key Artifact:** Allows entry regardless of Palace Guard result.  

   - **Palace Rooms (left to right):**  
     - Reveal all tokens. Determine strength per player.  
     - Strongest eligible player may buy artifact.  
     - **Cost Mechanism:**  
       - One treasure type per token used.  
       - Number of treasures per type = value of token.  
       - Example: Tokens 5 and 2 → pay 5 of one type and 2 of another.  
     - If buyer declines or cannot pay, next strongest may attempt.  
     - Unbought artifacts remain for next round.  

4. **Artifact & Spell Activation**  
   - **Artifact Use:**  
     - Each player may activate one artifact per round (two if won Djinn’s House).  
     - Place artifact in front of screen to activate.  
     - Effects:  
       - **Aladdin’s Lamp:** May play any number of Spell Cards this round.  
       - **Counterspell:** Cancel one opponent’s Spell Card when played.  
       - **Double:** One of your tokens counts as two of same value.  
       - **Flying Carpet:** Place in a space during tallying; acts as a '3' token.  
       - **Key:** Ignore Palace Guard requirement.  
       - **Scroll:** No in-game effect; used only for endgame tiebreak.  
   - **Spell Cards:**  
     - Played only if player has Aladdin’s Lamp.  
     - Played at any time during round, except on already-tallied spaces or Palace Guard space.  
     - If multiple players play, resolve in player order (starting player first).  
     - Effects are immediate and one-time.  
     - Full list:  
       - **2nd Chance:** Move any face-up or face-down token to another untallied space. Retain original orientation.  
       - **Abracadabra:** When buying an artifact, choose any from the room’s stack.  
       - **And the Last Will Be First:** Swap values of 1 and 9 for current and future spaces (not already tallied).  
       - **Charity:** Take 3 small treasures or 1 large (value 3) from bank.  
       - **City Tax:** Each other player pays 2 treasures per city token or removes it.  
       - **Donation:** Each player returns treasures. If a player has <5, they reveal and return all. The caster also returns 5.

       - **Sacrifice:** Each player returns treasures. If a player has <7, they reveal and return all. The caster also returns 7.  
       - **Smuggler:** After last Dragon Cave is tallied, if any city space is empty, you are strongest there. If Flying Carpet is later played there, resolve by player order. Caravanserai: may take camel if empty.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Token Strength:** Sum of token values in a space.  
- **Tiebreaking:** Always in player order (starting player first, then clockwise).  
- **Treasure Economy:** Large = 3 small. Exchange 3 small ↔ 1 large of same type at any time.  
- **Artifact Cost:** Determined by number and value of tokens used.  
- **Spell Timing:** Spells may be played during any phase, but not after a space is tallied. Responses allowed in player order.  
- **Flying Carpet & Double:** Count as real tokens for tax, scoring, and removal effects.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends immediately when the last artifact is bought.  
- Players count total artifacts.  
- Winner: Player with most artifacts.  
- **Tiebreakers (in order):**  
  1. Most Scroll artifacts  
  2. Player holding camel (starting player)  
  3. Most remaining treasure (house rule; not universal)  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use Double on a Flying Carpet?** Yes. It creates a second '3' token. Cost increases accordingly.  
- **Can I use Counterspell on a Spell played on me?** Yes. It cancels any Spell Card.  
- **Can I play Spell Cards after tokens are placed but before tallying?** Yes, as long as space not yet tallied.  
- **Can I use Artifact powers during Palace Guard resolution?** No, except Key and Spy.  
- **What if I play Flying Carpet after a space is resolved?** Invalid. Must be played as space is tallied.  
- **Can I use Parasite to copy Double or Flying Carpet?** Yes, if opponent used it first.  
- **Does Taboo! block Smuggler?** No. Smuggler doesn’t place a token; it grants strength.  
- **Can I use Aladdin’s Lamp to play multiple spells?** Yes, if you have the cards.
