## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Curious Cargo*, players compete to dominate a midnight market dealing in strange and valuable goods—robot parts, energy capacitors, and mysterious green jiggly substances. Each player runs a cargo facility, building conveyor systems to ship goods while intercepting their opponent’s shipments. The goal is to become the undisputed king of Curious Cargo by strategically constructing shipping lines, managing truck deliveries, and earning stars and points.

**Primary Objective**: Be the first to meet one of the end game triggers and then score more stars and points than your opponent. Players must ship at least 2 of each good type to be eligible to win.

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player takes a matching **Player Board** (use board #1 for first game), placed with board number in bottom-right corner.  
2. Each player takes a **Shipping Board**, placed adjacent to their Player Board with the 2-color side face up.  
3. Fill all empty spaces on the **Shipping side** of each player’s Shipping Board with corresponding **Goods**.  
4. Determine starting player: the one who most recently rode in a truck.  
5. Place **Turn Order Track** parallel to player boards. Place both **Forklifts** on space 0, with starting player’s on top.  
6. Place **Conveyor tiles** in the bag, shuffle, and set within reach.  
7. Place **Truck tiles**, **Construction tokens**, **Trucking tokens**, and **Splitters** in supply. Return purple Splitters to box (not used in 2-player base game).  
8. Give each player **5 Scaffolding tiles**.  
9. Shuffle **Truck deck** and deal **3 Truck cards face down** to each player.  
10. Each player **selects one card to keep**, gives the other two to their opponent. *(Skip in first game—keep all three.)*

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in **rounds**, each consisting of two phases:

1. **Construction Phase** (in turn order)  
2. **Trucking Phase** (in turn order)

After each phase, perform **End of Phase Cleanup**. The game ends when an **End Game Trigger** is met.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Construction Phase  
On their turn, a player may take up to **3 actions** from:
- **Draw a Conveyor tile** into hand (from bag).  
- **Play a Conveyor tile** from hand or storage.

Actions may be repeated and done in any order.

Additionally, a player may **use one Construction token** per turn to:
- Gain **2 extra actions**, or  
- **Place a Splitter** they own onto their board (requires spending the token).

##### Playing Conveyor Tiles  
- Play with **sand-colored side up**.  
- Must be placed **entirely within the teal grid** of the Player Board.  
- Cannot cover **machines, walls, or numbered spaces**.  
- **No adjacency requirement**—tiles need not connect to existing lines.  
- **Stacking allowed**, but tiles must lie flat.  
- Use **Scaffolding tiles** to support overhangs.  
- If a tile covers a **Gear symbol**, take **1 Construction token** from supply (if available).

##### Active Connections  
An **active connection** is a continuous line (by color) from a **machine port** to a **numbered loading dock** (1–9).  
After placing a tile:
- Count total active connections.  
- If this number **exceeds** your current position on the **Turn Order Track**, move your **Forklift** forward to match.  
- Collect **bonuses** for all spaces landed on or passed through.  
- If tied with opponent, place your Forklift **on top**.  
- **Never move backward**, even if connections are later broken.

##### End of Construction Phase Cleanup  
- Any **Conveyor tiles in hand** go into **storage**. Player chooses order and placement.  
- Cannot rearrange existing storage.  
- If a player has **more than 3 of any token type** (Construction, Trucking, Splitters), return excess to supply.

---

#### Trucking Phase  
Begin with **initial Loading and Unloading**. Then, in turn order, each player chooses **one** of the following actions:

1. **Play Truck Cards**  
   - Spend up to **2 Action Points (AP)**.  
   - Play one card at a time, discarding it after use.  
   - Place the corresponding **Truck tile** on **either player’s Shipping side**.  
   - Trucks enter with rear at **street number 1**.  
   - If space occupied, push existing trucks forward.  
   - Any part extending past **street 10** is **removed** from the facility.

2. **Discard a Truck Card for Conveyor Tiles**  
   - Receive number of **Conveyor tiles** shown on the card.

3. **Discard Conveyor Tiles for a Truck Card**  
   - Discard:  
     - Top tile from **each of two stacks** in storage, **or**  
     - Top **2 tiles** from a **single stack**.  
   - Draw **1 Truck card** from deck.

*Discarded cards and tiles are removed from the game.*

Additionally, a player may **use one Trucking token** per turn:
- Draw **1 Truck card**.  
- Gain **2 AP** to spend on playing Truck cards.  
- Must spend **at least 1 AP** by end of turn.

##### Loading and Unloading  
Occurs:
- At **start** of Trucking Phase.  
- **After every Truck card played**.

**Loading (Shipping Side)**  
- Goods **automatically load** onto empty truck spaces adjacent to **active Shipping connections**.  
- **Same good types cannot be adjacent** on a truck.  
- Cannot load onto **blocked spaces** (marked with X).  
- **Mandatory** if possible.  
- If multiple loads would cause adjacent duplicates, **choose which connection to use**.  
- Take goods from **leftmost available** spot on Shipping Board.

**Unloading (Receiving Side)**  
- Goods **automatically unload** if adjacent to **active Receiving connection** of same color.  
- **Mandatory**.  
- Place good in **leftmost empty Receiving slot** of that type.  
- Max **4 slots per good type**—excess goods are **removed from game**.

**Truck Movement Between Facilities**  
- Truck exiting **your Shipping side** → enters **opponent’s Receiving side**.  
- Truck exiting **your Receiving side** → **removed from game** (with goods).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Triggers  
Game ends **after the phase** in which any of these occur:
- A player **ships the required number of goods** (as shown on Shipping Board).  
- A player **reaches a star** by:
  - Receiving their **4th of any one good type**, or  
  - Making **10 active connections** (reaching space 10 on Turn Order Track).  
- **Conveyor draw bag is empty**.  
- **Truck deck is empty**.

#### Winning Conditions  
To be **eligible to win**, a player must have **shipped at least 2 of each good type**.  
If neither player meets this, the game is a **draw**.  
If both fail, also a **draw**.

Otherwise, winner is determined in order:

1. **Most stars** wins.  
   - Stars are earned by:
     - Receiving **4th of any good type** (1 star per type).  
     - Reaching **10 active connections** (1 star).  
2. **Tiebreaker: Most points**.  
   Points from:
   - **Shipping**: Rightmost filled column for each good = points (per column).  
   - **Bonus**: Complete **5 or 6 columns** → bonus points (8 pts for 6).  
   - **Receiving**: Rightmost filled Receiving slot for each good = points.  
   - **Turn Order Track**: Points shown on current space (e.g., space 9 = 4 pts).  
   - **Unused components**: 1 pt each for **unused tokens** and **Splitters**.  
3. **Final tiebreaker**: Player **ahead on Turn Order Track** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build lines that don’t connect?** Yes. Only active connections (to numbered docks) matter.  
- **Can I play a tile that doesn’t create a connection?** Yes.  
- **What if I can’t legally load a good?** Choose which active connection to use (if multiple).  
- **Can I send trucks to my own side only?** Yes, but sending to opponent can block or redirect.  
- **Do Splitters count as covering Gears?** Yes—if a Splitter covers a Gear, take a Construction token.  
- **Can I use both a token and an action on same turn?** Yes—tokens are **in addition** to normal actions.  
- **What happens if both players trigger end game?** Game ends after the phase; scoring proceeds normally.  
- **Can I use Scaffolding after placing a tile?** Yes, as needed to support overhangs.
