### 3. Setup  

#### Board Setup  
- Place **assist tiles** vertically in order: yellow, blue, green, brown.  
- To the left of each assist tile, place development tiles in a horizontal row:  
  - 2 players: 3 tiles per row  
  - 3 players: 4 tiles per row  
  - 4 players: 5 tiles per row  
- Place **Phase Marker** on the first blue pit water field (Spring of Year 1) on the Year Wheel.  
- Place **Year Marker** on Year 1.  
- Place **player scoring markers** at 0/50 on the scoring track.  

#### Resource Board & Action Discs  
- Place resource boards (one per player).  
- Place action discs into the main bag according to player count:  
  - **2 players**: 7 black, 7 brown, 4 yellow  
  - **3 players**: 10 black, 10 brown, 7 yellow  
  - **4 players**: 13 black, 13 brown, 10 yellow  
- Draw **3 discs** and place in each player’s **Reserve Pool** (left side).  
- Draw **6 discs** and place in each player’s **Action Pool** (right side). Bag should now be empty.  

#### Player Setup  
- Each player chooses a color and takes 11 player discs.  
- Place **18 coal cubes** on the player board as indicated (in Pinge and Tunnel).  
- Randomly determine **turn order**; place player discs on the Year Wheel in order.  

#### Resources  
- Coal, wood, food, and pit water are unlimited.  
- Keep supplies accessible.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **3 years**, each consisting of **3 Action Phases** (Spring, Summer, Autumn) and **1 Scoring Phase** (Winter).

Each **Action Phase** proceeds in this order:  
1. **Refill Resource Boards** *(skip in first phase of first year)*  
   - Return all used/unused action discs to the bag.  
   - Move 3 discs from each player’s **Reserve Pool → Action Pool**.  
   - Draw 3 new discs from the bag into each **Reserve Pool**.  
   - If any Action Pool has fewer than 6 discs, refill it from the bag until full (bag will empty).  
2. **Spring & Autumn Only**: Each player receives **1 pit water** and places it in their mine.  
3. **Take Action Discs (up to 2 times)**  
   - **Step 1**: In turn order, each player takes all discs of one color from one Action Pool.  
     - If the chosen pool has a symbol, also take **1 pit water**.  
   - **Step 2**: If player has fewer than 5 total discs, may take a second set (same rules), up to **5 total**.  
     - In **Spring of Year 1 only**, if player takes fewer than 5 discs, may **return 1 pit water** to supply.  
   - Place 1st take on **Cart Field 1**, 2nd on **Cart Field 2**.  
4. **Determine New Turn Order**  
   - Add values of discs in **Cart Field 1** using the action disc value chart (black=1, brown=2, yellow=3).  
   - Reorder players from **lowest total → highest total**.  
   - Tie: reverse current turn order.  
5. **Plan Actions**  
   - Players simultaneously (or in new turn order) place action discs on workers (Farmer, Farmhand, or Development).  
6. **Execute Actions**  
   - In turn order, players resolve all actions.  
   - Each worker performs all its actions before the next player’s worker acts.  
   - Player decides order of their own workers’ actions.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Workers & Actions  
Each worker can perform actions using placed discs:  

- **Farmer & Farmhand**  
  - To gain resources: place **1+ discs of same color** on worker.  
    - Yellow disc(s) → gain 1 food per disc  
    - Brown disc(s) → gain 1 wood per disc  
    - Black disc(s) → either:  
      - Remove 1 or 2 **pit water**  
      - **Excavate 1 coal**  
  - **Coal Excavation Rules**:  
    - Coal taken **left-to-right**.  
    - In **Pinge**: can mine up to the first unoccupied wood space.  
    - In **Tunnel**: requires **at least 1 wood placed** in tunnel.  
    - A worker may mine in **Pinge OR Tunnel**, not both per turn.  
    - Excavated coal from Pinge goes directly to **Farm**.  
    - Excavated coal from Tunnel goes to **Shaft**; must be reeled up by Haspelknecht.  
  - **Bonus**: In **Summer**, if Farmer produces at least 1 food, gain **1 bonus food**.  
  - **Synergy**: If Farmer and Farmhand both produce same resource or work in same mining area (excavate or remove water), the **second worker activated gets an extra action** (equivalent to one additional disc).  

- **Haspelknecht (Tunnel-only)**  
  - Can **reel up coal** from Shaft to Farm, or **remove pit water from Shaft**.  
  - Requires **<2 pit water in Shaft** to lift coal.  
  - Only the Haspelknecht can remove water from the Shaft.  

#### Development Actions (1x per phase)  
- Place discs **matching required color** on a worker to activate a development purchase. Grey discs are wild.  
- Place **one of your player discs** on the development tile.  
- **Purchase Rules**:  
  - Can buy any tile in **top (yellow) row**.  
  - For **lower rows**, must be adjacent to a tile you already own, OR buy one already owned by another player.  
  - If buying from another player, pay **1 resource** (type depends on row) to the player with the top disc.  
  - **Costs for non-yellow rows**:  
    - Grey/Blue row: $1  
    - Green row: $2  
    - Brown row: $3  
- **VP Bonus**: Based on **purchase order** in the row: first buyer gets highest bonus, decreasing down.  
- **Each development can be purchased once per player**. Stack discs if multiple players buy same tile.  

**Development Abilities (1x use per phase)**:  
- **Coal Digger**: Pay 1 yellow disc, 1 food, or $1 → perform **2 actions** (each: remove 1–2 water or excavate 1 coal)  
- **Coal Miner**: Pay 1 yellow disc or $1 → **excavate 3 coal** from Tunnel → Shaft (cannot work in Pinge)  
- **Haspelknecht**: Pay 1 yellow disc, 1 food, or $1 → perform **3 actions** (each: remove 1–2 water or lift 1 coal from Shaft to Farm)  

#### Pit Water Management  
- While mining **Pinge**, all pit water accumulates there.  
- When **Tunnel opens** (i.e., mining begins there), all water flows to **Shaft**.  
- **Pinge is exhausted** when all coal removed:  
  - Remaining pit water moves to Shaft.  
  - Wood returned to supply.  
  - Replace Coal-digger & Pinge tile with **Coal-miner & Haspelknecht** tile.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after **3 years**. Final scoring includes:

- **Coal in Farm Area**:  
  1/2/3/4/+ coal = 0/0/2/3/1+ VP  
- **Tunnel Sections Emptied**:  
  +VP per emptied section (value shown on board)  
- **Development Bonuses**:  
  - +1 VP per emptied Tunnel section with **matching symbol** on owned developments  
  - +1 VP per **Handcart or Coal Driver** development owned  
  - +VP for **building symbols** on developments:  
    1/2/3/4 symbols = 1/3/6/10 VP  
  - +1 VP per **unused Action Marker** from development tiles  
- **Money Left**:  
  $1/$2/$3/$4 = 2/5/9/14 VP; each additional $ = +6 VP  
- **Penalties**:  
  - Debt chits: -1 VP for 1st, -2 VP for each additional  
  - Pit water: -1 VP for each beyond **1 remaining**  
- **Bonus**:  
  - +2 VP if all 7 coal excavated in **Year 1**  
  - +1 VP if all 7 coal excavated in **Year 2**  
  - +1 VP if **1 wood stored** in Farm during Storage phase  

**Winning**: Highest VP wins.  
**Tiebreaker**: Most coal removed. If still tied, earlier turn order wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use wood immediately after gaining it?**  
  Yes. Wood can be placed in Tunnel at any time when owned.  
- **Can I mine coal from both Pinge and Tunnel in same turn?**  
  No. A worker may mine in **only one area** per activation.  
- **Can I use a development ability without owning it?**  
  No. Must have placed a disc on the tile to use its ability.  
- **What happens if I can’t refill Action Pools to 6?**  
  Boards may have fewer than 6. Final board may be short.  
- **Can I store more than one resource during Storage?**  
  No. Each player may store **1 total resource** (food, wood, or coal).  
- **Can I use synergy bonus if both workers do different actions in same area?**  
  No. Only if both produce **same resource** or work in **same mining area** (excavate/remove water).
