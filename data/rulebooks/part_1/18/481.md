## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players compete to become the heir of Charlemagne (Carolus Magnus) by building castles across his empire. Control over five paladin clans is used to gain influence in territories. The goal is to either build all of one’s castles or control the most castles when few regions remain.

2. Components  
- 15 territory tiles  
- Emperor (Charlemagne) figure  
- Paladin cubes in 5 colors (total 15 of each color)  
- Colored cylinders (clan markers), one per color  
- Player sets:  
  - 5 numbered discs (1–5)  
  - Court card (to track paladin color control)  
  - Castles:  
    - 2 players: 10 each  
    - 3 players: 8 each  
    - 4 players: 10 shared per team (black or white)  
- Dice (3 or 4, depending on player count) with color faces and crown wilds  
- Colored cylinders for clan control  

3. Setup  
1. Arrange the 15 territories in a circle, leaving small gaps. Place the Emperor on one territory at random.  
2. Randomly place one paladin cube of any color on each territory (3 cubes of each color used total).  
3. Each player takes:  
   - A Court card  
   - Numbered discs (1–5) in their color  
   - Appropriate number of castles:  
     - 2 players: 10 castles each  
     - 3 players: 8 castles each  
     - 4 players: Teams share 10 castles (black or white); each player has personal discs and Court  
4. Determine starting paladin reserves:  
   - 2 players: Each rolls 7 dice (3 dice used; 4th die not used)  
   - 3 players: Each rolls 9 dice  
   - 4 players: Each player rolls 7 dice (3 dice used per roll)  
   - Take one paladin cube per die result; crown = choose any color  
   - Place cubes in player reserve  
5. Place remaining paladin cubes, dice, and clan markers (cylinders) within reach.  
6. Randomly choose starting player for first round.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has two phases:  

A. Opening Phase – Disc Selection  
- Players simultaneously choose and reveal one numbered disc (1–5).  
- All played discs must have different values unless unavoidable (e.g., last round before reset).  
- Turn order is determined by disc value: lowest to highest.  
- In case of duplicate values (only possible when resetting), the player who played earlier takes precedence (lower effective number).  
- After all 5 discs are used, players retrieve them for reuse.  

B. Action Phase – Player Turns (in disc order)  
Each player performs the following in sequence:  

1) Play Paladins  
- 2 or 4 players: Play exactly 3 paladins from reserve  
- 3 players: Play exactly 4 paladins from reserve  
- Paladins may be placed:  
  a) On any territory (to influence regional control)  
  b) Beside matching color on own Court (to vie for clan control)  
- All paladins must be played; none can be saved.  

2) Check Clan Control  
- For each color, compare number of paladins on players’ Courts.  
- The player with the most of a color takes control by placing the colored cylinder on their Court.  
- In case of tie, current controller retains control.  
- Control is per player (not team), even in 4-player game.  

3) Move Emperor  
- Move Emperor clockwise 1 to N steps, where N = value of disc played in Opening Phase.  
- Each territory or merged region counts as 1 step.  
- Emperor must move at least 1 step.  

4) Evaluate Region & Build/Merge  
- When Emperor stops, evaluate control of that region:  
  - Each player’s control value =  
    - Number of paladins they control (via clan ownership) in the region  
    - Plus number of their castles in the region  
  - The player (or team in 4-player) with the highest total gains majority.  
  - In case of tie, no action is taken.  
- If majority is achieved:  
  - The controlling player/team places one of their castles (or team castle) in the region, replacing any existing castles of other players.  
  - Only one castle is placed per turn, even if multiple territories are in the region.  
- Merging:  
  - If the newly built castle is adjacent to another territory/region with same-colored (or team) castle, merge them into one region.  
  - All paladins and castles from both areas are combined.  
  - Merged regions count as one movement step.  
  - Merging does not trigger control evaluation.  

5) Replenish Paladin Reserve  
- Roll dice:  
  - 2 or 4 players: Roll 3 dice  
  - 3 players: Roll 4 dice  
- Take one paladin per die result:  
  - Color shown = take that color  
  - Crown = choose any color  
- If a color is exhausted in the supply, all players return equal numbers from their Courts to the supply until cubes are available.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Turn Order: Determined by numbered discs (1–5); reused in cycles.  
- Clan Control: Individual-based; achieved by having the most paladins of a color on Court.  
- Region Control: Based on sum of controlled paladins in region + owned castles.  
- Movement: Emperor moves 1–N steps clockwise; merged regions count as one space.  
- Castle Placement: Only when Emperor stops and majority control is achieved.  
- Merging: Automatic when adjacent same-color (or team) castles exist; irreversible.  
- Team Play (4 players):  
  - Teams share 10 castles (black or white).  
  - Control of regions is determined by summing team members’ controlled paladins.  
  - Discs, Courts, and paladin reserves are individual.  
  - No sharing or transferring of paladins between teammates.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when either condition is met:  
A) A player or team places their final castle:  
   - 2 or 4 players: 10th castle placed → that player/team wins  
   - 3 players: 8th castle placed → that player wins  
B) 3 or fewer separate regions remain (due to merging):  
   - The player or team with the most castles on the board wins.  
- No tiebreakers; if tied, the game ends in a draw (per original rules).  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can paladins be played to a teammate’s Court in 4-player?  
  A: No. Paladins can only be played to own Court or to territories.  

- Q: What happens if a player cannot play a unique disc?  
  A: When resetting after playing all 5 discs, duplicates may occur. The player who played earlier in the previous round is considered to have the lower number.  

- Q: Do merged regions affect movement?  
  A: Yes. Each merged region counts as a single step during Emperor movement.  

- Q: Can you build a castle in a region that already has your castle?  
  A: Only if you gain majority control when Emperor stops there. If already in control, no new castle is placed unless replacing opponent’s.  

- Q: Are castles removed when a region is taken over?  
  A: Yes. All opponent castles in the region are removed and replaced 1-for-1 with the new controller’s castles.  

- Q: Can you decline to build a castle even with majority?  
  A: No—majority triggers mandatory castle placement (unless all castles already built).  

- Q: How are exhausted paladin colors handled during replenishment?  
  A: If a color is out of supply, all players return equal numbers from their Courts until supply is restored.  

- Q: Can Emperor stay in place?  
  A: No. Must move at least 1 step.  

- Q: Do paladins in territories contribute to clan control?  
  A: No. Only paladins on a player’s Court affect clan control.  

- Q: Can a player control a clan with zero paladins in play?  
  A: Yes, if they have the most on their Court—even if only one.
