## Tides of Time – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Tides of Time is a card-based strategy game where players build a tableau of powerful locations and wonders to earn Victory Points (VPs). The goal is to outscore opponents over three rounds by fulfilling the conditions of Scoring Cards and leveraging synergies between cards.

### 2. Components  
- Player cards (divided into suits: Temple, Stronghold, etc.)  
- Scoring Cards (reveal one per round)  
- Victory Point (VP) tokens  

*(Note: Specific quantities not provided in source.)*

### 3. Setup  
- Each player begins with a personal tableau.  
- At the start of each round, a Scoring Card is revealed that determines how players earn VPs that round.  
- Players draft or acquire cards during the round to build toward scoring conditions.  

*(Note: Full setup details such as number of cards dealt or starting conditions are not in the source.)*

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Reveal Scoring Card**: One Scoring Card is revealed per round.  
2. **Play Cards**: Players play cards to their tableau during the round (exact draft/draw method not specified).  
3. **Score**: At the end of the round, players score VPs based on the current round’s Scoring Card.  
4. **Repeat**: This occurs over three rounds.  
5. **Final Scoring**: Total VPs from all rounds determine the winner.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Scoring  
- Each Scoring Card is evaluated **independently**.  
- A single card or symbol may contribute to **multiple** Scoring Cards in the same round.  
- However, each card/symbol is counted **once per Scoring Card**.  

#### Key Card Effects  

**The Roof of the World**  
- Doubles the number of your **most numerous suit(s)**.  
- Only the **suit count** is doubled — not the number of physical cards, printed text, or VPs.  
- The doubled suit count applies to **all** scoring purposes.  
- Provides **0 VPs** on its own.  

**The Sapphire Port**  
- Scored **after** all other cards.  
- Grants **8 VPs** if you scored the **highest single VP total from one card** that round.  
- Its **own 8 VPs are not counted** when determining eligibility (cannot self-trigger).  
- Can benefit from doubled suits (e.g., via The Roof of the World) when other cards generate high VPs.  

**Kings Nest**  
- Wins **all ties** in majority counts.  
- **Exception**: You must have **at least one** of the suit to qualify.  
- You **do not win** a tie if both players have **zero** of a suit.  

**The Molehill**  
- Grants **8 VPs** to the player with the **most suits** that have **exactly one card**.  
- **The Roof of the World does not affect this**: it doubles suits, not cards.  
- Having one card in a suit still counts as one card — suit doubling doesn’t create additional single-card suits.  

**The Maze of the Damned**  
- Grants **13 VPs** if you have **at least one card of every suit** (a full set).  
- The wording is **"For a set"**, not "For each set".  
- Therefore, you earn **13 VPs once** if condition is met — **not doubled** even with The Roof of the World.  

#### Errata & Clarifications  
- **Kings Nest**: Works with **The Molehill**, but **not with The Roof of the World** (per v2 rules).  
- **The Great Library of Ahm / Golden Ziggurat / Old Man's Pass / Blood-tear Spring**: You must have **at least one** of the relevant symbol to be eligible to score.  
- **The Sky Pillars**: Corrected text reads **"For each set of suits"**, not "For each set of cards".

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game lasts **3 rounds**.  
- After each round, players score VPs based on the round’s Scoring Card.  
- Some cards (e.g., The Sapphire Port) require final scoring order to be known before resolving.  
- Total VPs from all rounds are summed.  
- Highest total wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a card count for multiple scoring cards?**  
  Yes — each Scoring Card is evaluated separately. The same card can contribute to multiple conditions.  

- **Does The Roof of the World double VPs?**  
  No — it only doubles the **number of suits**, not VPs, card text, or card count.  

- **Can The Sapphire Port trigger itself?**  
  No — its own 8 VPs are **not counted** when determining which card gave the most VPs.  

- **Does Kings Nest win 0–0 ties?**  
  No — you must have **at least one** of the suit to be eligible.  

- **Does The Roof of the World help The Molehill?**  
  No — The Molehill counts suits with **exactly one card**. Doubling suits doesn’t change card count.  

- **Does The Maze of the Damned give 26 VPs with The Roof of the World?**  
  No — it awards **13 VPs** if you have a full set of suits. It does not scale with multiple sets.
