## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The goal is to be the last player with at least one survivor or, if multiple players survive all rounds, to have the most Victory Points (VP). Players lead survivor groups across a zombie-infested landscape, scavenging resources, battling hordes, and surviving encounters over 8 rounds (or until the adventure deck runs out). The journey ends when only one player remains, or after the final round, when VP are tallied.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Lead survivor and 1 bidding marker per player (by color)  
- 4 grey survivors, 4 blue ammo, 4 red gas, 4 yellow adrenaline tokens per player  
- Initiative tiles (numbered 1–4)  
- Auction board with bid spaces (0–10)  
- Adventure deck: Level 1, 2, and 3 encounter cards  
- Zombie tokens (10 provided)  
- Tokens: Map, Wheel, Molotov Cocktail, Scope, Timmy, Infected, Wounded  
- Dice: Black (standard survivor dice), Red (horde dice)  
- Epilogue cards (face-up during setup)  
- Optional: Contaminated area tiles, CAR KEYS (for Journey Variant)

### 3. Setup  
- Each player chooses a color and takes matching lead survivor, bidding marker, and 4 each of survivors, ammo, gas, adrenaline.  
- Randomly deal one initiative tile to each player.  
- Place all bidding markers on the "0" space of the auction board.  
- Shuffle Level 3, Level 2, and Level 1 cards separately.  
  - Remove 4 random cards from each level (return to box).  
  - Create the adventure deck: place 3 cards face-down at the bottom, then 1 face-down on top.  
  - If playing with 1–3 players, remove all cards with poker symbols (J, Q, K, A in bottom-left).  
- Lay out epilogue cards face-up.  
- Place all tokens, dice, and zombies within reach.  

*Player Count Adjustments:*  
- **3 players**: Draw 6 cards in Planning Phase → 3 paths of 2 cards.  
- **2 players**: Same as 3p, plus place a +2 key on the 3rd path.  
- **1 player**: 3 paths:  
  - 1st path: both cards face-down. Take 2 random resources before flipping.  
  - 2nd path: left card face-up, right face-down.  
  - 3rd path: both face-up, pay +2 resources due to +2 key.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Repeat the following 3 phases for 8 rounds or until the adventure deck is exhausted or only one player remains:

#### Planning Phase  
- Player with initiative #1 draws 8 cards (6 if <4 players) and arranges them into 4 (or 3) rows of 2 cards each ("paths").  
- If a player is eliminated:  
  - After 1st elimination: place +2 key on 4th path (must pay 2 resources to take it).  
  - After 2nd elimination: move +2 key to 3rd path, add +4 key to 4th path.  
- In 1-player mode, paths have special visibility rules.

#### Auction Phase  
- Starting with initiative #1, players take turns:  
  - Move bidding marker to a higher-numbered space than current position, or  
  - Pass (can re-enter bidding later unless all pass consecutively).  
- Only one marker per space (except "0").  
- Max bid is 10; cannot bid more than total available resources.  
- Auction ends when all players pass in a row.  
- Assign new initiative tiles: highest bidder gets #1, etc.  
  - Ties at 0: maintain previous relative order.  
- All players pay resources equal to their final bid (any combination).  
- Return all bidding markers to "0".

#### Encounter Phase  
- Players take turns in new initiative order.  
- On your turn:  
  - Choose one remaining path (row).  
  - Resolve left card completely, then right card.  
  - If you survive, take both cards (face-down) and any indicated tokens.  

**Card Resolution (3 Steps):**  
1. **Scavenge**: Take resources shown in top-left corner.  
2. **Event**:  
   - Black text: resolve immediately.  
   - Red text: applies to the upcoming fight.  
   - Die rolls: use black dice; count matching icons regardless of β symbols.  
3. **Fight**: Defeat number of zombies shown (bottom-right).  

**Fight Options:**  
- **Ranged Attack (Optional)**: Spend ammo. Roll 2 black dice per ammo spent. Each Ⓞ kills 1 zombie. Other results ignored.  
- **Flee**: Before melee, spend 2 gas. Return card to box. Gain no points.  
- **Melee**: Roll black dice = number of survivors (including lead).  

**Horde Rules (if red skulls present):**  
- Before rolling, swap up to # of survivors black dice for red dice (1 per skull, max = # of survivors).  
- Rolling on red die: kills 1 of your survivors instantly.  

**Combat Resolution:**  
- Fight continues until zombies or survivors are eliminated.  
- If you win: take card (face-down) and any tokens.  
- If all your survivors die: you are eliminated.  

**Special Combat Effects:**  
- **Casualty**: After any loss, spend 1 adrenaline or lose 1 survivor.  
- **Opportunity Kill**: Spend 1 adrenaline to kill 1 zombie (anytime during fight).  
- **Bonus Kill**: Kill 1 zombie; may spend 1 adrenaline to kill another.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Bidding**: Strategic resource investment for turn order.  
- **Resource Management**: Ammo (ranged), gas (flee/travel), adrenaline (survival), survivors (dice count).  
- **Horde vs Regular**: Hordes require red dice substitution and risk survivor loss on .  
- **Tokens (require card activation):**  
  - **Map**: Worth 6 VP at game end.  
  - **Wheel**: Treat hordes as regular zombies (no red dice).  
  - **Molotov Cocktail**: Discard to kill entire zombie group/horde. Take card.  
  - **Scope**: Discard to avoid losing 2 survivors (e.g., from red die).  
  - **Timmy**: Kill a specific 6-strong horde OR lose 3 ammo.  
  - **Infected/Wounded**: Lose 1 survivor (immediate effect).  
- **Elimination & Path Keys**:  
  - 1st elimination → +2 key on 4th path.  
  - 2nd elimination → +2 key on 3rd path, +4 key on 4th path.  
  - To take a keyed path, pay the required resources before scavenging.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends when:  
- Only one player has survivors after an Encounter Phase → that player wins immediately.  
- All players have 0 survivors → no winner.  
- Adventure deck is exhausted or 8 rounds completed → score VP.  

**Scoring (for surviving players):**  
- +VP from face-down cards (top-right number).  
- +3 VP for each epilogue card earned:  
  - Most adrenaline, ammo, gas, survivors (1 card per category).  
  - Tie: no one gets the card.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Most VP → if tied, most remaining survivors.  

*1-player mode additional scoring:* +1 VP per set of 1 survivor, 1 gas, 1 ammo, 1 adrenaline.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I bid 0 and still get a turn?** Yes. Passing is allowed; initiative order is based on final bid.  
- **Can I use adrenaline after losing last survivor?** No. If all survivors die and you can’t pay adrenaline cost, you are eliminated.  
- **Can I use tokens anytime?** Only when activated by a card. Molotov, Scope, Wheel, etc., are discarded when used.  
- **Can I reroll dice?** No. Dice are rolled once per phase.  
- **Can I scavenge if I flee?** No. Fleeing skips fight and gives no rewards.  
- **Can I use Bonus Kill after Opportunity Kill?** Yes, as long as you kill a zombie during your action.  
- **Are tokens unlimited?** Yes.  
- **Do I shuffle the deck?** No. Deck is never shuffled after setup.
