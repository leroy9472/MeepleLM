## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Players take on the roles of opposing wizards—Light (white) and Dark (black)—competing for control over the mystical "great void" at the center of the board. The game is a re-theming of *Rosenkönig*, originally set during the War of the Roses.

**Objective**: The winner is the player who controls the greatest total value of **joined (contiguous) territory** at the end of the game, where territory value is calculated as the square of the number of connected spaces.

### 2. Components
- 1 game board (hexagonal grid with center space marked by an ice star/sun symbol)
- 24 movement cards (8 directions, each with cards of distance I, II, III)
- 8 wizard cards (4 per player, one set white/light, one set black/dark)
- 52 double-sided powerstones (light on one side, dark on the other; e.g., from Othello)
- 1 king wizard marker (or crown marker; can be substituted with a coin or token)

Note: Components may be sourced from other games or printed from BGG.

### 3. Setup
1. Place the board between the two players. One player sits with the ice star/crown at the top of the board facing them (upside-down text).
2. The player sitting with the ice star at the top controls the **white (light)** wizard; the other controls the **black (dark)** wizard.
3. Place the 52 powerstones in a supply next to the board.
4. Shuffle the 24 movement cards and deal **5 face-up** to each player.
5. Place the remaining movement cards face-down as a draw pile.
6. Players place their 5 movement cards in front of them, oriented so the ice star (or crown) on the cards matches the orientation of the one on the board.
7. Each player places their 4 wizard cards beside their movement cards.
8. Place the king wizard marker on the central space (marked with the ice star).

The **Red/Dark player** begins the game. (Note: In original *Rosenkönig*, Red starts; this carries over to the Dark/Black player in Ice Wizards.)

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players alternate turns. On each turn, a player must choose **exactly one** of the following three actions:

1. **Play a Movement Card**  
2. **Draw a Movement Card**  
3. **Play a Wizard Card and Movement Card Together**

If no legal action is possible, the player must **pass**, and the opponent continues to take turns until a legal move becomes available.

#### 1. Play a Movement Card
- Choose one of your face-up movement cards.
- Move the king wizard marker in the direction and distance shown (I, II, or III spaces).
- The marker **must move the full distance** shown.
- The destination space **must be empty** (no powerstone of either color).
- The movement **must not take the marker off the board**.
- **Before** placing the marker on the new space:
  - Place a powerstone of your color on that space.
  - Then place the king wizard marker on top.
- Discard the movement card to a discard pile.
- **Do not draw a replacement.**

#### 2. Draw a Movement Card
- You may draw a card **only if you have fewer than 5 movement cards**.
- Draw the top card from the draw pile and place it **face-up** in front of you, oriented to match the board (ice star up).
- When the draw pile is exhausted, **shuffle the discard pile** to form a new draw pile.

#### 3. Play a Wizard Card and Movement Card Together
- You may do this **only if you have unused wizard cards** (max 4 per player, one-time use).
- Discard one movement card **and** one wizard card.
- Move the king wizard marker according to the movement card.
- The destination may be a space occupied by an **opponent's powerstone**.
- **Before** placing the marker:
  - Flip the opponent’s powerstone to your color.
- Place the king wizard marker on the flipped stone.
- Discard both the movement card and the wizard card (wizard cards do not return).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Movement**: Always initiated by playing a movement card. Direction and distance are fixed.
- **Territory Building**: Every time you move (via action 1 or 3), you place or flip a powerstone, claiming a space.
- **Zugzwang**: Players must move if any legal action is available—even if disadvantageous.
- **Card Management**: Players maintain up to 5 movement cards. Drawing is optional but limited by hand size.
- **Wizard Cards**: Allow capture of opponent territory by flipping their powerstone. Powerful for breaking up large territories or claiming key spaces.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### End Game Triggers
The game ends immediately when **either** of the following occurs:
- Both players have 5 movement cards and **neither can make a legal move**.
- A player places the **last available powerstone** on the board.

#### Scoring
- A **territory** is a group of orthogonally connected (edge-sharing) spaces with your color powerstones. Diagonal adjacency does not count.
- For each territory, score **(number of spaces)²**.
  - Example: 5 connected spaces = 25 points.
- Total score = sum of all territory scores.

#### Tiebreakers (in order):
1. **Highest score** wins.
2. If tied, player with the **largest single territory** wins.
3. If still tied, player with the **most powerstones** of their color on the board wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I move to a space with my own powerstone?**  
  No. All moves (even with wizard cards) require the destination to be either empty or occupied by an **opponent’s** powerstone (only wizard card allows the latter).

- **Can I use a wizard card to move to an empty space?**  
  No. Wizard cards **only allow movement to opponent-occupied spaces**. If you want to move to an empty space, use a regular movement card.

- **What if I have no legal move?**  
  You must pass. Your opponent continues taking turns until a move becomes possible.

- **Do I have to use a wizard card if it's my only legal move?**  
  Yes. If playing a wizard + movement card is your only legal action, you **must** do so.

- **Are movement cards reused?**  
  Yes, but only after the draw pile is exhausted. The discard pile is shuffled to form a new draw pile.

- **Can I play a wizard card without a movement card?**  
  No. Wizard cards must be played **with** a movement card.
