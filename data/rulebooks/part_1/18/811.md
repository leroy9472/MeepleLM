### 1. Lore & Objective
Rummikub is a tile-based game that combines elements of rummy, dominoes, and mah-jongg. The objective is to be the first player to play all tiles from your rack by forming valid sets (groups or runs). The game emphasizes strategic planning, manipulation of existing sets, and efficient use of jokers.

### 2. Components
- 106 tiles:  
  - 104 numbered tiles: Two complete sets of numbers 1–13 in four colors (black, red, blue, orange).  
  - 2 joker tiles (wild cards).  
- 4 player racks (holds up to 24 tiles each).  
- Optional: Timing device for competitive play.

### 3. Setup
1. Place all tiles face down and shuffle thoroughly.  
2. Each player draws one tile; highest number goes first. Return tiles and reshuffle.  
3. Each player takes 14 tiles (two stacks of 7) and places them on their rack.  
4. Remaining tiles form the pool (draw pile), arranged in face-down stacks.  
5. No trump tile is used in standard play.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Play proceeds clockwise.  
- On a turn, a player must:  
  1. **Draw** one tile from the pool **OR**  
  2. **Play** one or more tiles from the rack.  
- Players who have not yet made their initial meld must draw if they cannot fulfill it.  
- After drawing or playing, the turn ends with no further actions.  
- A player may manipulate existing table sets only after completing their initial meld.  
- Turn limit: 1 minute (enforced in tournament play).  
- Game ends when a player empties their rack and calls "Rummikub!"

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Sets
- **Group**: 3 or 4 tiles of the same number, each in a different color.  
  - Example: Red 7, Blue 7, Black 7.  
- **Run**: 3 or more consecutive numbers in the same color.  
  - Tile 1 is always low (1-2-3 valid; 12-13-1 invalid).  
  - Example: Blue 4-5-6.

#### Initial Meld
- First play must total **at least 30 points** using tiles from the player’s rack only.  
- Jokers used in initial meld count as the value of the tile they represent.  
- Players may delay entry by drawing instead.  
- No building on or manipulating table sets before initial meld.

#### Melding & Manipulation
- After initial meld, players may:  
  - Add tiles to existing sets (extend runs or complete groups).  
  - Manipulate sets using combinations such as:  
    - Removing a tile from a group to form a new set.  
    - Splitting a run to create multiple valid runs.  
    - Combining tiles from multiple sets with rack tiles to form new sets.  
- At the end of the turn, only valid sets may remain; no loose tiles allowed.

#### Joker Rules
- Jokers are wild and can substitute for any tile.  
- A player may retrieve a joker by replacing it with the actual tile it represents (from rack or table).  
- Retrieved joker **must be used immediately** in a new set, along with **at least one tile from the player’s rack**.  
- A joker **cannot be retrieved before** the player has made their initial meld.  
- A set containing a joker can be split or manipulated, but if the joker is freed, it must be used in the same turn.

#### Time Limit & Penalties
- **1-minute turn limit** (monitored in official play).  
- If time expires during manipulation:  
  - All tiles must be returned to original positions.  
  - Player draws **3 penalty tiles** from the pool.  
  - If original positions cannot be recalled, leftover tiles go to the bottom of the pool, and player draws an equal number.  
- Players who fail to make initial meld when able:  
  - **100-point penalty** if unable.  
  - **200-point penalty** if able but chooses not to.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- When a player calls "Rummikub!" (empties rack):  
  - Other players sum the face value of tiles on their racks.  
  - Each score is recorded as a **negative** amount.  
  - Winner receives a **positive** score equal to the sum of all others' negative scores.  
- If the pool is exhausted and no further moves are possible:  
  - Player with **lowest rack value** wins.  
  - Each player subtracts winner’s total from their own; result is their negative score.  
  - Winner receives the sum of all negative scores as a positive total.  
- Joker on rack at end: **50-point penalty**.  
- No meld made: 100 or 200-point penalty as above.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you play a tile you just drew?**  
  No. Tiles drawn during a turn cannot be played until a future turn.  
- **Can you manipulate a set with a joker?**  
  Yes, but if the joker is freed during manipulation, it must be used immediately in a new set with at least one tile from your rack.  
- **What if two players tie in games won?**  
  Winner is determined by highest total score.  
- **Can you retrieve a joker and save it?**  
  No. The joker must be played immediately in a new set.  
- **What if a player has three doubles (same number and color) at start?**  
  In championship rules, player may request a redeal for all players at the table.
