# Tortuga 1667 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 1667, pirates sail the Caribbean near the Spanish Galleon, united in plunder—but divided by secret loyalties. Each player is a pirate secretly loyal to either Britain or France; in odd-player games, one player may be Dutch. The goal is to ensure your nation holds the most treasure when the Spanish Armada card is revealed. Deception, alliances, and betrayal are key—no pirate is truly trustworthy.

**Win Condition:**  
- The nation (British or French) with the most treasure across ships and Tortuga wins when the Spanish Armada is revealed.  
- In games with a Dutch player and a tie: Dutch wins.  
- In games without a Dutch player and a tie: Continue play with a new event row; first nation to take the lead wins.

  - Third → First Mate of Flying Dutchman  
  - Continue alternating until all drawn.  
- Remaining pawns are out of game.

#### E. Treasures
