## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
D-Day Dice is a solo or cooperative dice-chaining wargame set during the Normandy invasion of WWII. Players command Allied units advancing from beach landings toward a fortified German bunker. The objective is to survive combat, manage resources, and reach the Bunker to assault it. Victory is achieved by defeating the German forces within the Bunker and surviving the mission.

### 2. Components  
- 6 custom dice (results: Soldier, Courage, Tool, Star, Skull)  
- Unit marker with chevrons (track unit strength)  
- Specialist cards (e.g., Medic, Lieutenant, Captain)  
- Item cards (e.g., Bangalore Torpedo, Grenade, Mine Detector)  
- Award/Decoration cards (earned through achievements)  
- Map sectors (numbered N-01 to N-20) with terrain, DEF values, and icons (MGF, Landmines)  
- Playmats and player aids (e.g., Phase tracker, CRT)  

---

### 3. Setup  
- Choose a Starting Sector (e.g., N-01 to N-08). If multiple are available, select one.  
- Place your Unit in the chosen Starting Sector.  
- Add any printed resources (Soldiers, Courage, Tools, etc.) shown on the Starting Sector to your Unit.  
- Set Unit marker to first chevron.  
- Shuffle Specialist, Item, and Award/Decoration decks.  
- Prepare German Final Tally (if playing with AI opponent).  

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
All Units play simultaneously, following these phases in order:

#### PHASE 1 — ROLL THE DICE  
- Roll 6 dice.  
- Lock 2 dice of your choice.  
- Re-roll the remaining 4 dice up to 2 times.  
- Final set of 6 dice is your “Final Tally.”  

#### PHASE 2.A — UPKEEP  
- Count all results in your Final Tally.  
- Apply sector bonuses/penalties (add or subtract results).  
- Include any persistent effects (e.g., RWB bonuses, Leadership).  

#### PHASE 2.B — ADJUST THE UNIT MARKER  
- Advance your Unit marker one chevron.  
- If no chevrons remain, you **must move** during Phase 4.  

#### PHASE 3 — RECRUIT, FIND, TRADE, PURCHASE  
- **Recruit 1 Specialist** per turn by spending Stars.  
- **Find 1 Item** per turn by spending Item Points.  
- **Purchase 1 Award/Decoration** per turn:  
  - Spend 6 Courage (random draw).  
  - Or earn via special conditions (e.g., rolling one of each symbol).  
- **Trade resources** with another player in the same sector (unless restricted).  

#### PHASE 4 — MOVE  
- You may **Advance** (forward), move **laterally**, or **stay**.  
- **Cannot move backward** or **revisit** any sector.  
- **Maximum 3 turns** in any one sector.  
- If moving:  
  1. Resolve terrain effects (e.g., Landmines: roll 1d6 for Soldier loss).  
  2. Apply movement benefits (e.g., Whistle, Battle Cry).  
  3. Satisfy new sector requirements (e.g., have required Specialist).  
  4. Pay Courage cost to **Advance** (if applicable).  
  - If under **Battle Cry**, ignore requirements and Courage cost.  
- If unable to complete all steps, Unit is **destroyed**.  
- After successful move, **adjust Unit marker** to appropriate side.  

#### PHASE 5 — COMBAT  
- Lose Soldiers equal to the **DEF** of your current sector.  
- If sector has **MGF (Machine Gun Fire)** icon, roll for MGF (lose additional Soldiers).  
- Optional: Use **Combat Results Table (CRT)** to fight back:  
  - Use items (e.g., Grenade, Bangalore Torpedo) to reduce DEF.  
  - Calculate odds (Allied strength vs. DEF).  
  - Roll with modifiers (Leadership, Equipment).  
  - Apply German losses to DEF (cumulative).  
  - Earn Courage/Awards for eliminating resistance.  

#### PHASE 6 — ASSAULT (Bunker Only)  
- Triggered when a Unit enters the Bunker.  
- After both sides resolve Phase 5, compare forces:  
  - Allied strength = remaining Soldiers + Specialists (1 each).  
  - German strength = Bunker DEF.  
- If Allied > German:  
  - Win assault.  
  - Draw 1 Decoration (if other Units remain).  
  - Game continues.  
- If Allied ≤ German:  
  - Assault fails.  
  - Unit may be destroyed (per scenario rules).

  No. Cannot trade in top row sectors or sectors adjacent to the Bunker. Dice trading still allowed.

  No. You **must move** during next Phase 4.
