## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the roles of rival brothers vying for dominance over Grecian lands. Victory is determined by accumulating Victory Points (VPs) through acquiring Reward cards, completing Feat cards, and retaining Hero cards. The player with the most VPs at game end wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most face-down Feat cards wins.

### 2. Components  
- 174 Unit Cards (Soldiers, Beasts, Oracles, Spirits, Heroes)  
- 12 Reward Cards (divided into 3 Cities of 4 cards each)  
- 6 Feat Cards per player (identical sets)  
- 40 Coins (shared pool; players limited to 20 total)  
- Optional: Relic Cards, Challenge Cards, Whim Cards (expansions)  

### 3. Setup  
1. Shuffle all Unit Cards and place them face-down to form a shared deck.  
2. Place 40 coins beside the deck.  
3. Shuffle the 12 Reward Cards and deal them into 3 face-down stacks (4 cards each) to form Cities.  
4. Each player receives:  
   - 1 of each of the 6 Feat Cards (placed face-up)  
   - 4 Unit Cards  
   - 4 Coins  
5. Determine first player (oldest player, or via Emissary of War variant).  

*Optional Variants:*  
- **Card Drafting:** Players draft cards to build individual decks.  
- **Deck Building:** Players construct pre-built decks within limits.  
- **Test of Skill:** Each player uses a unique 50-card deck.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, complete these steps in order:

#### Step 1: Wealth  
- Gain 3 Wealth Actions (first player gets only 2 on their first turn).  
- Each action: draw 1 Unit Card or gain 1 Coin.  
- **Wealth Action Bonus:** If all actions are the same type, gain +1 extra (4 cards or 4 coins).  
- Announce intentions; do not look at drawn cards until step ends.  

#### Step 2: Surge  
- Spend coins to play Unit Cards from hand.  
- Pay the Cost (gold number) to place a Unit on your side of any City.  
- **Unit Placement Rules:**  
  - Max 5 Units on your side of any City (City Limit).  
  - Soldiers, Oracles, Spirits, Heroes = 1 Unit  
  - Beasts = 2 Units  
- **Unit Abilities Triggered:**  
  - **Soldier:** Ability triggers immediately upon entering a City (mandatory unless "may" is used). Includes movement from hand, deck, discard, or between Cities.  
  - **Beast:** May be played normally (no ability), or discarded after paying cost to activate its ability.  
  - **Oracle/Spirit/Hero:** No immediate effect when played.  
- Once per Surge Step, play **1 Reward Card** from hand for its effect, then place it face-down in your play area.  

#### Step 3: Portent  
- Activate each Oracle ability **once per turn**, in any order.  
- Abilities that reveal cards from the deck: unrevealed/unkept cards are discarded.  
- Cards added to hand (e.g., via Cloudcall Pegasus) are not considered "drawn."  

#### Step 4: Feat  
- Check Feat Cards. If conditions are met, announce and flip the card face-down.  
- Multiple Feats can be completed per turn.  
- Feats are checked **before** War Step.  

#### Step 5: War  
- A City is **War-torn** if:  
  - Opponent has ≥3 Units in the City, **or**  
  - Total Units (both players) ≥5  
  - *Beasts count as 2 Units for both conditions.*  
- **Battle Resolution:**  
  - Sum Strength (red number) of all Units on each side.  
  - Higher total wins. On tie: player with more Soldiers wins. If still tied, no winner.  
  - Winner takes top Reward Card into hand, keeps **1 Unit** in City.  
  - Loser keeps **2 Units** in City.  
  - **Important:** Winner cannot keep a Beast (counts as 2 Units).  
  - All other Units are discarded.  
- Resolve all War-torn Cities.  

#### Step 6: Offering  
- **Optional:** Discard 1 Unit Card from hand to gain cards/coins equal to its Offering Value (blue number).  
- Discard down to **7 cards** in hand (includes Unit and Reward cards).  
- Return excess coins to pool to max **10 coins**.  
- Flip all **Enraged Units** you control back face-up.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Enraged Status  
- Only **non-Beast** Units (Soldiers, Oracles) can be Enraged.  
- When Enraged: flip face-down → becomes a Beast with Strength 4, loses all abilities.  
- Counts as a Beast for City Limit and War-torn.  
- Cannot be Enraged if it would exceed City Limit.  
- Flipped face-up at end of **Offering Step**.  

#### Beasts  
- Count as **2 Units** for:  
  - City Limit  
  - War-torn condition  
  - Battle discard rules (winner cannot keep one)  
- Count as **1 card** for:  
  - Drawing  
  - Discard effects  
  - Offering  

#### Drawing & Discarding  
- If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
- Revealed cards (e.g., Oracle effects) go to discard unless ability specifies otherwise.  
- You may search your discard pile at any time.  
- When retrieving a card from discard (e.g., Hades’ Caress), show it to opponent.  

#### Reward Cards  
- Begin face-down in Cities.  
- Won during War Step → added to hand.  
- Can be played **once** during Surge Step for effect → placed face-down in play area.  
- **Scoring:**  
  - 2 VPs if in hand at game end  
  - 1 VP if face-down in play area  
- Cannot be forced to discard or reveal.  

#### Feat Cards  
- 6 per player, face-up at start.  
- Flip face-down when completed.  
- **Scoring:** 2 VPs per face-down Feat.  
- Conditions include:  
  - Discard 3+ Units from opponent in one turn (Hades)  
  - 5+ Units in one City (Ares)  
  - Draw 5+ cards in one turn (Poseidon)  
  - 1 Beast in each City (Artemis)  

#### Spirits & Heroes  
- **Spirit:** When played, choose one ability. Or, pay Invoke cost and discard to use both.  
- **Hero:** Not typically played into Cities. Discard ability can be used during opponent's turn if condition met. Worth 1 VP in hand at game end.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Conditions (check at end of turn):  
- Opponent has **5 face-down Feat Cards**, **or**  
- **2 or more Cities** have no Reward Cards left  

When triggered:  
- If due to Feats, **opponent gets one final turn**.  
- If due to Cities, game ends **immediately after active player's turn**.  

#### Scoring:  
- **2 VPs** per face-down Feat Card  
- **2 VPs** per Reward Card in hand  
- **1 VP** per face-down Reward Card (used)  
- **1 VP** per Hero Card in hand
