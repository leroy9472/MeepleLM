## BAUSACK — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
BAUSACK (also known as SAC NOIR) is a dexterity-based building game designed by Klaus Zoch. It features 66–70 uniquely shaped wooden blocks and offers multiple game variations, each emphasizing balance, strategy, and player interaction. The core concept revolves around building towers from irregular blocks under specific rules. Players must balance risk, stability, and resource management depending on the chosen variant.

The objective varies by game mode:
- **Knock Out**: Be the last player with a standing tower.
- **Pile It High / Well Stacked**: Build the tallest tower.
- **Building Chain / Baukette**: Use the most pieces or keep your tower standing longest.
- **Tower of Babel**: Be the first to earn 5 points (diamonds/beans) by surviving tower collapses.
- **3x Red Wins**: Be the first to successfully place three red blocks on your tower or have the last standing tower.

### 2. Components  
- 66–70 wooden building blocks (irregular shapes, including red pieces in some sets)  
- 1 fabric sack containing 60 play diamonds (also called "beans" in some versions)  
- 1 measuring tool (mentioned in one source, not used in rules)  
- Optional: "Zoch piece" (special foundation block used in variants)

### 3. Setup  
- Empty all blocks from the sack and spread them in the center of the table for shared access.  
- Play on a stable, flat surface without tablecloths to prevent unintended movement.  
- Each player receives **10 diamonds** (play money) at the start of auction-based games (Knock Out, Pile It High, Well Stacked, 3x Red Wins, Baukette).  
- Spent diamonds are returned to the sack.  

**Per Game Setup:**  
- **Knock Out / Well Stacked / 3x Red Wins / Pile It High**: Standard setup with 10 diamonds per player.  
- **Building Chain / Baukette**: All players use a “Zoch piece” (6×3×1.5 cm block) as foundation if available; others find a piece of similar surface area.  
- **Tower of Babel**: No personal towers; all players contribute to a shared tower. No money used.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Gameplay differs significantly by variant. Below is a breakdown of the core mechanics and flow.

#### General Rules (Apply to All Variants)  
- **Foundation Rule**: The first block a player uses becomes their foundation. All subsequent pieces must be placed on top of it and cannot touch the table.  
- **No Touching**: Players may not touch existing parts of their or others’ towers with hands. The only way to adjust a piece is by using the block currently being placed.  
- **No Table Contact**: Do not shake or bump the table. Violators may be disqualified.  
- **Spacing**: Keep towers far enough apart so that one collapse does not affect others.

#### Auction Mechanics (Used in Knock Out, Pile It High, Well Stacked, 3x Red Wins, Baukette)  
Two main auction types exist:

**1. Highest Bidder (a.k.a. Best Offer)**  
- Auctioneer selects a block and starts bidding (minimum 1 diamond).  
- Bidding proceeds clockwise. Players can raise the bid or pass.  
- Highest bidder pays their bid into the sack and takes the block.  
- If no one bids, the auctioneer must take and build the block.

**2. By Refusal (a.k.a. Refuse / Risk Auction variants)**  
- Auctioneer selects a block and says “By Refusal!”  
- Starts with “zero” bid and passes to left neighbor.  
- Each player must either:  
  - Take and build the block, or  
  - Bid one more diamond than the previous player to pass it on.  
- The player who accepts the block builds it and pays nothing.  
- All others who bid must pay their last bid to the sack.  
- If the block returns to the auctioneer, they must bid or take it.  
- **Critical Rule**: If a player cannot afford the required bid, they must take the block.

**Special Cases:**  
- A player with 0 diamonds can still initiate auctions.  
- In “Highest Bidder,” they can only bid 0 and hope no one else bids.  
- In “By Refusal,” they are forced to take any piece passed to them if they can’t match the bid.

### 5. Core Mechanics by Game Variant  

#### **Knock Out** (Ages 12+, 2–6 players, 30–45 min)  
- Goal: Last tower standing.  
- Each player builds own tower.  
- Auctioneer chooses block and auction type (Highest Bidder or By Refusal).  
- After auction, next player clockwise becomes new auctioneer.  
- When a tower falls, that player is eliminated. All their blocks return to the center pile.  
- Winner: Last player with standing tower.  
- **Variant: Knock-Out-For Sure**  
  - Each player starts with one “Zoch piece.”  
  - If offered a block via By Refusal and cannot or will not take it, they may pass the block to the left and place their Zoch piece into that player’s tower instead.  
  - They exit the auction without paying.  
  - Zoch piece cannot be used as foundation.

#### **Pile It High** (Ages 8+, 2–6 players, ~30 min)  
- Goal: Build the tallest tower.  
- Auction types: Highest Bidder and **Give Away**.  
- **Give Away Auction**: Winner chooses which opponent must build the block.  
  - Opponent can:  
    1. Accept and build it themselves, or  
    2. Challenge the giver to place it on their tower.  
  - If the tower collapses during placement by the giver, the **giver’s turn ends**, and they cannot build further that round. The opponent may rebuild their tower to its prior height and continue.  
- If a tower falls, that player is out. Remaining height counts.  
- A player may voluntarily stop building and lock their height.  
- Game ends when all but one tower has fallen or no one dares build higher.  
- Winner: Tallest standing tower.

#### **Well Stacked** (Ages 10+, 2–6 players, ~30 min)  
- Goal: Have the tallest surviving tower.  
- Auction types: **Take** (same as Highest Bidder) and **Risk Auction**.  
- **Risk Auction**:  
  - Auctioneer selects a block and gives it directly to another player.  
  - Recipient chooses:  
    1. Build it themselves — if tower falls, they are out.  
    2. Force the auctioneer to build it on their tower — if it falls, **auctioneer is out**. Recipient may rebuild their tower.  
- Auctioneer may place the piece as destabilizingly as possible.  
- Players may stop building voluntarily.  
- Game ends when only one tower remains.  
- Winner: Tallest surviving tower.

#### **Building Chain / Baukette** (Ages 6+, 2–5 players, ~30 min)  
- Goal: Keep tower standing longest; if all pieces used, tallest wins.  
- All players use Zoch piece (or equivalent) as foundation.  
- **Piece Selection Phase**:  
  - Youngest player picks any block and places it in front of them.  
  - Repeat until each player has 12 blocks (or 20 each if only 2 players).  
  - Arrange blocks in a line (chain) extending from foundation.  
- **Gameplay**:  
  - Youngest starts. On turn, take the **first unused block** from **any player’s chain**.  
  - Build it on your own foundation.  
  - Once a chain is used up, fewer options remain.  
- If tower falls, player is out. Their blocks are removed. Unused blocks in their chain remain available.  
- Winner: Last tower standing. If all pieces used, tallest tower wins.  
- **Tip**: Play best-of-three. Loser of round 1 starts round 2; first eliminated in round 2 starts round 3.

#### **Tower of Babel** (Ages 5+/8+, 2–8 players, 20–30 min)  
- Goal: Be first to collect 5 diamonds.  
- Cooperative tower building.  
- Youngest player places first block (foundation).  
- Players take turns placing one block on the shared tower.  
- When tower collapses, the player who placed the **last successful piece** (i.e., the one before the collapse) takes 1 diamond.  
- Rebuild a new tower from scratch.  
- Game continues over multiple rounds.  
- Winner: First to 5 diamonds.  
- **Variation**: Draw blocks blindly from sack instead of selecting.

#### **3x Red Wins** (Ages 12+, 2 players, ~30 min)  
- Tactical 2-player game.  
- Only auction type: **Highest Bidder**.  
- Winner of auction may:  
  - Keep the piece and add it to their own tower, or  
  - Offer it to opponent, who **must build it**.  
- Multiple foundations allowed, but each new piece must increase overall height. Foundations must touch.  
- Winning conditions (either):  
  - First to place **third red block** on their tower, or  
  - Have the **last standing tower** if both are still up.  
- Play multiple rounds. Loser of previous round starts next.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
| Game | Winning Condition |
|------|-------------------|
| **Knock Out** | Last tower standing |
| **Pile It High** | Tallest tower when all others have fallen or stopped |
| **Well Stacked** | Tallest tower when all others have fallen |
| **Building Chain** | Last tower standing; if tie, tallest wins |
| **Tower of Babel** | First to collect 5 diamonds |
| **3x Red Wins** | First to place 3 red blocks OR last tower standing |

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I touch my tower to steady it?**  
  A: No. Only the block being placed may be used to nudge other blocks. Hands must not touch the tower.

- **Q: What if I run out of diamonds?**  
  A: You continue playing. In Highest Bidder, you can only bid 0. In By Refusal, you must take any block passed to you if you can’t afford the bid.

- **Q: Can I choose not to build anymore?**  
  A: Yes, in Pile It High and Well Stacked, you may stop voluntarily. You keep participating in auctions but cannot add more blocks.

- **Q: What happens when a tower falls?**  
  A: In solo-tower games (Knock Out, Pile It High, Well Stacked), the player is eliminated. Blocks return to center (except in Baukette/Building Chain, where only built blocks are removed). In Tower of Babel, only the last builder before collapse scores.

- **Q: Can I place blocks beside the foundation?**  
  A: No. All pieces must be placed **on top** of the foundation or prior pieces. Nothing may touch the table.

- **Q: Can I use multiple foundations?**  
  A: Only in **3x Red Wins**, and they must touch. All other games require a single foundation.

- **Q: What if two players win simultaneously?**  
  A: In Tower of Babel, only one player scores per collapse. In others, tiebreakers: height (taller wins), or play an extra round.
