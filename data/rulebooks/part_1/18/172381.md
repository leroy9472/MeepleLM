### 1. Lore & Objective
Each player leads their own village, starting with a small farmyard and one villager in each of five professions: Abbot, Councilman, Traveller, Craftsman, and Merchant. The goal is to gain the most Prestige Points (PP) by developing your village through buildings, fields, travel, customers, and monks, while managing the passage of time and recurring rat invasions. The game ends when a set number of villagers have died (9/14/18 for 2/3/4 players). The player with the most PP wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Rat Invasion**: Triggers only if rat reaches the large rat invasion space. All players affected, even if they didn't trigger the roll.
- **Story Points**: Only those moved to the main house count. Tree points are lost in rat invasions and do not score.
- **Villager Death**: If no chronicle space, use lowest-numbered anonymous grave. Grave numbers are for counting only.
- **Meeting Place Tile**: If on a served customer, return tile to Meeting Place. Can be moved via Meeting Place's banner action.
- **Craft Buildings**: Only one per type allowed. When purchasing, choose any card from the column.
- **Travel Cards**: Must be acquired in order A→B→C→D→E. Gray banners on cards add costs for next travel. Chapel D card (8 PP) ends travel early.
- **Cloister Church**: Starts with 1 monk (window). Limits total monks to 5 (max 6 including itself).
- **Sanatory Church**: Can avoid rat invasions twice by placing markers. After two uses, invasions affect you normally.
- **Trading Church**: When using Steward's Office, reveal one extra card (7 total), take one free, then pay for others.
- **Travel Church**: After drawing a travel card, may reject it (bottom of stack), draw next, and must take it. Shuffle stack afterward.
- **Guild Council**: Markers are wild goods; can pay for any good or act as plow on fields.
- **Area Council**: At end, gain 1 PP per card in marked categories (Travel, Craft, Served Customers, Church/Monks, Fields).
- **Population Council**: At end, gain 4 PP per living villager type with a marker on the card.
- **Component Limits**: Cards are limited; if out, cannot acquire. Story points, black markers, day laborers are unlimited (use substitutes).
