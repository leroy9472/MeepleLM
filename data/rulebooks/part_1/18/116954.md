## Butterfly Garden – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the warmth of spring, butterflies emerge and flutter along winding paths. Players lay path tiles to guide butterflies from fountain tiles toward their own flowerbeds. The goal is to attract the most and loveliest butterflies by directing them to your Flowerbeds. The player with the most points from collected butterflies at the end of the game wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Gameboard  
- 1 Bag  
- 4 Player Screens  
- 54 Path Tiles  
- 7 Fountain Tiles  
- 24 Player Tokens (4 colors, 6 each)  
- 24 Butterflies and Bases (1 Purple, 5 Pink, 6 Blue, 12 additional in reserve)  

Note: Excess player tokens are returned to the box after setup.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the Gameboard in the center of the table.  
2. Each player chooses a color and takes the matching Player Screen and 6 Player Tokens.  
3. Place the 7 Fountain Tiles on the Gameboard as shown in the example (1 in center, 6 around edges).  
4. Place Player Tokens on the marble areas (gateways) around the board according to player count:  
   - 2 players: 1&1/2&2/1&1/2&2/1&1/2&2  
   - 3 players: 1&1/1&2/3&3/3&1/2&2/2&3  
   - 4 players: 1&2/2&3/1&4/4&2/3&1/3&4  
   Return unused tokens to the box.  
5. Place butterflies on Fountain Tiles:  
   - Center Fountain: 1 Purple, 5 Pink  
   - Each of the 6 outer Fountains: 1 Blue Butterfly each  
6. Place remaining butterflies in a reserve area next to the board.  
7. Shuffle all 54 Path Tiles and place them in the Bag.  
8. Starting Player is chosen. Each player, in clockwise order, draws 2 random Path Tiles from the Bag and places them behind their Player Screen (hidden from others).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, follow these steps in order:  
1. **Place a Path Tile**  
2. **Move Butterflies**  
3. **Draw a Path Tile**  

Play proceeds clockwise. The game ends immediately when no butterflies remain on the Gameboard.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### 1. Placing Path Tiles  
- Choose one of your two hidden Path Tiles to place.  
- Place it on any empty hexagonal space on the board.  
- A Path Tile **cannot** be placed such that both ends of a path directly connect to the edge of the board (i.e., "dead-end" placement against board edges is invalid).  
- Tiles may be rotated freely.  
- Placement may connect to existing paths, Fountain Tiles, or Flowerbed Entrances.

#### 2. Moving Butterflies  
When a Path Tile is placed adjacent to a tile containing a butterfly, butterflies move:  
- **Butterflies must move** if their path is extended.  
- Movement follows the newly connected path **to its end**—butterflies do not stop midway.  
- **Order of movement**:  
  - If the center Fountain Tile is involved, **Pink Butterflies move first**.  
  - The **Purple Butterfly moves only after all Pink Butterflies have left** the center.  
- **Collisions**:  
  - If two butterflies meet on the **same path**, they **both fly away** and are returned to the box.  
  - Butterflies on different paths of the same tile (3 paths per tile) do not collide.  
- **Arriving at a Flowerbed**:  
  - The edge sections between Fountain Tiles are **Flowerbed Entrances**, each holding up to 3 Path Tiles.  
  - The Flowerbed belongs to the player(s) whose token(s) are placed at that gateway.  
  - If **one player** owns the Flowerbed, they take the butterfly and place it behind their screen.  
  - If **two players** share the Flowerbed:  
    - One player takes the arriving butterfly.  
    - The other player takes a butterfly of the **same color** from the reserve.  
  - Collected butterflies are hidden behind player screens and scored at game end.

#### 3. Drawing Path Tiles  
- At the end of the turn, draw one random Path Tile from the Bag and place it behind your screen.  
- If the Bag is empty, the player ends their turn with only one tile (or fewer).  
- Players always have up to 2 tiles in hand, except when the Bag is exhausted.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends **immediately** when no butterflies remain on the Gameboard.  
- Players reveal their collected butterflies and score:  
  - **Purple Butterfly**: 3 points  
  - **Pink Butterfly**: 2 points  
  - **Blue Butterfly**: 1 point  
- The player with the **most points wins**.  
- **Tiebreaker**: All tied players win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a tile that doesn’t trigger butterfly movement?**  
  Yes. You may place a tile that doesn’t connect to any butterfly-holding tile. No movement occurs.  
- **What if I place a tile that connects to multiple butterfly paths?**  
  All affected butterflies move along their respective paths. Resolve movement for each butterfly or group in logical order (e.g., center first, then others).  
- **Can a butterfly return to a fountain?**  
  No—once a butterfly leaves a fountain, it moves forward only. Fountains are not destinations after initial placement.  
- **What if the reserve runs out during a shared Flowerbed collection?**  
  The rule implies reserve butterflies are sufficient. If not, game assumes adequate supply.  
- **Do butterflies move if the new tile only connects sideways, not extending the path?**  
  No—only if the path is extended in the direction of travel. A butterfly only moves if the path it is on is continued forward.
