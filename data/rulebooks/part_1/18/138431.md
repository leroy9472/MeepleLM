### 4. Gameplay Flow  
**Turn Sequence:**  
1. **Refresh Phase**  
   - Refresh all standard and reaction powers, skills, energy shields, and Guard tokens.  
   - Discard used passive devices.  

2. **Strategy Phase**  
   - **Alpha Agent Promotion:** Players choose Alpha Agent (Mar > Bio > Inf > Sni > Hul if tied).  
   - **Get GD Wings:** If any alien was killed last round, each operative agent rolls 3 green dice:  
     - 1+: Bronze (Basic Tactic)  
     - 1+: Silver (Skill)  
     - 2+: Gold (Improved Tactic)

     - Return 1 inoperative agent by discarding 1 Alien Tech Fragment.  
     - Gain 1 Generic Device or random Improved/Alien Weapon by discarding 4 fragments.  
   - **Mission Status Check:** Check Storybook’s “Mission Status” table. First matching condition determines mission outcome.  

3. **Battle Phase (clockwise from Alpha Agent)**  
   - **Agent Turn (Operative agents only):** In any order:  
     - **Movement:** Up to movement value. Cannot move through aliens.  
     - **Action:** Perform one action (e.g., Search, Evade, Unjam, Use Device).  
     - **Combat:** Ranged or melee attack.  
   - **Alien Turn (after each agent):**  
     - Draw Close Encounter card.  
     - Activate matching alien types per card.  
     - Apply AI rules: Movement → Combat.  

4. **Event Phase**  
   - Alpha Agent draws Event card.  
   - Resolve effects in order:  
     - **Standard:** Immediate effect, discard.  
     - **Special:** Refer to Storybook for narrative impact.  
     - **Weather:** Lasts until replaced by another weather event.  
     - **Teleport:** Spawn signal or alien.  
     - **Move:** Move signal until it enters agent LOS (then Reveal).  

Repeat until mission ends.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Line of Sight (LOS):** Clear center-to-center path. Blocked by walls, doors, or terrain. Diagonal through blocking hex = no LOS.  
- **Combat:**  
  - **Hit Roll:** Attacker rolls red dice as per weapon.  
  - **Defend Roll:** Defender rolls 1 blue die per hit. Each shield cancels one hit.  
  - **Energy Shield Armor:** Cancel hits before rolling defense dice.  
  - **Wounds:** Reduce HP. At 0 HP, agent becomes **Bleeding** (1 hex move, forfeit combat, may use 1 power/action). Dies if suffers another wound.  
- **Alien Activation:**  
  - Draw Close Encounter card → activate matching alien types.  
  - Teleport if none on board.  
  - Assign cards per rules (first player clockwise without card, or to controller of same species).  
- **Signals:**  
  - Reveal when entering agent LOS.  
  - Draw top alien card, assign to player.  
  - Movement directed by Event card.  
- **Alien Tech Fragments:**  
  - Earned when:  
    - First alien killed in Battle Phase.  
    - Agent rolls die during Search action.  
  - Max 1 per method per round.  
  - 4 fragments = Reinforcement option.
