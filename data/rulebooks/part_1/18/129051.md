## Building Score Track for Le Havre: The Inland Port — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Building Score Track is a tool used in *Le Havre: The Inland Port* to calculate the end-game value of a player’s buildings. It functions similarly to the Warehouse scoring boards but is adapted for tracking building values in increments that reflect their coin worth. The goal is to accurately compute the total value of all owned buildings using a movement-based scoring system on a grid.

### 2. Components  
- **Building Score Track**: A grid with numerical values increasing vertically in steps of 10 and horizontally in steps of 2.  
- **Player Cube**: One unused player cube is placed on the track to represent the current score during calculation.

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player selects one of their unused cubes.  
2. Place the cube at the "0" position located in the lower-left corner of the Building Score Track.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Used during the final scoring phase of *Le Havre: The Inland Port*. After all game actions are complete, players score each building in turn by moving their cube across the track according to its value and the allowed movement types.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
**Scoring via Movement**  
Each type of move corresponds to a specific coin value:  
- ➝ Right: +2 coins  
- ↗ Up & to the right: +12 coins  
- ↑ Up: +10 coins  
- ↖ Up & to the left: +8 coins  

To score a building:  
1. Determine the building’s point value in coins.  
2. Move your cube from its current position using any combination of the above moves that sum to the building’s value.  
3. Continue this process for each building.

**Grid Wrapping Rule**  
- If a move would take your cube to the far-right column, you may transfer your cube to either of the other two squares (columns) that share the same numerical value, then continue scoring from there. This avoids edge limitations.

**Special Rule for Variable-Value Buildings**  
Four buildings have values dependent on resources:  
- Fish Factory  
- Grain Silo  
- Brick Factory  
- Wood Factory  

If the resource count for any of these is **odd**:  
- Option 1: Pay 1 coin to the bank → add 1 coin to the building’s value.  
- Option 2: Subtract 1 coin from the building’s value → take 1 coin from the bank.  

This ensures the final value used in scoring is even (since all other building values are divisible by 2).

**Tip for Efficient Scoring**  
It is recommended to score a building worth 8–12 coins first, using only horizontal (→ +2) or diagonal-up-left (↖ +8) moves along the 0 row. This positions the cube near the center column, simplifying future movements and reducing the chance of hitting the far-right edge early.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The Building Score Track is used once, at the end of the game.  
- After all buildings are scored, the final position of the cube indicates the total coin value of the player’s buildings.  
- This total contributes directly to the player’s final score.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I use any combination of moves to reach a building’s value?**  
A: Yes. You may mix move types (e.g., one ↑ +10 and one ➝ +2 to score a 12-value building), as long as the total equals the building’s value.

**Q: What happens if I run out of space on the top of the grid?**  
A: The vertical limit is not specified; assume the track can be extended conceptually upward if needed. In practice, the maximum building value total should fit within the printed grid.

**Q: Do I have to follow a specific path?**  
A: No. Players choose the most efficient or convenient path based on current cube position and desired future flexibility.

**Q: Are the diagonal moves restricted in direction?**  
A: Only ↖ (+8) and ↗ (+12) are defined. Downward or lateral diagonal moves are not valid for scoring.
