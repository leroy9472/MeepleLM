# De Vulgari Eloquentia — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In late medieval Italy, scholars and merchants seek to shape the development of Volgare—the vernacular language—into a respected literary form. Players compete to become the most renowned scholar by earning Victory Points (VPs) through acquiring knowledge, manuscripts, status, and influence.

**Objective:** Accumulate the most VPs by the end of the game. In case of a tie, the player with the most knowledge wins.

### 2. Components
- Game board showing map of Italy, turn track, and action tracks
- Player pawns and discs (for tracking positions)
- Manuscript tiles (levels 1–4 and Lingua Volgare level 8)
- Event tiles (numbered 1–10 and Papal event tiles)
- Canticle tiles (5 small tiles for Franciscan cities)
- Papal Library tiles (numbered 2–4, one wild tile)
- Cubes: Red (Politicians), Black (Nobles), Yellow (Abbesses), Green (Amanuenses)
- Player screens and colored discs
- Ducats (money)
- Turn marker (purple pawn)

### 3. Setup
1. **Turn Track:**
   - Place Event tile "10 – Stupor Mundi" on Turn 10.
   - Randomly draw one of the remaining Event tiles (1–9) and place it on Turn 1.
   - Fill Turns 2–9 in sequence, wrapping after 9.
   - Place 5 Papal Event tiles face-down on Turns 12–16.

2. **Map:**
   - Randomly place the 5 Canticle tiles face-up on their marked spaces.
   - Shuffle each manuscript level deck (1–4), draw (P–1) tiles per level (P = player count), place face-up on respective tracks.
   - Place Lingua Volgare (8) tile below level 4 track.

3. **Cubes:**
   - Place cubes on Turn Track spaces according to player count:
     - Turns 1–7: As specified (e.g., 3 red, 3 black, 4 yellow, 5 green in 5-player).
     - Turns 8–11: No cubes initially.
   - Unused cubes go in bag.

4. **Players:**
   - Each takes a color: pawn, 20 discs, screen, 10 ducats (visible).
   - Randomly place one disc per player on Turn Order track (bottom of board).
   - Stack discs on space 1 of Knowledge track in reverse turn order (last player on bottom).
   - In reverse turn order, place pawns on unoccupied starting cities: Torino, Vicenza, Ancona, Taranto, Catania.
   - All players start as Merchants.

5. **Other:**
   - Shuffle Papal Library tile deck, place face-down beside its track.
   - Lay out Friar and Cardinal tiles face-up.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of 13–16 turns has four phases:

#### Phase 1: Event
- Advance turn marker.
- Reveal Event tile for the current turn and place it on the map.
- **Exception:** On Turns 12–16, flip one Papal Event tile. If the second red tile is revealed, this is the final turn. All players move to Rome immediately.
- Remove previous Canticle tile; flip current one if applicable.
- Move unused cubes from previous turn to next available Turn Track space (priority: Red → Black → Yellow → Green).
- Refill manuscript tracks to (P–1) face-up tiles per level. If a level cannot be refilled:
  - Shift all higher-level manuscripts up one row (cost reduced by 1 action).
  - Place Lingua Volgare (8) on the now-empty level 1 row (costs 4 actions, can be taken from any region).

#### Phase 2: Charity (Turns 1–11 only)
- If any Friars or Cardinals exist:
  - Richest Merchant pays 5 ducats to each Friar and 10 to each Cardinal, **provided** Merchant has more money.
  - If tied for richest, each recipient chooses their benefactor.
  - If no eligible Merchant, bank pays.
  - Payments are resolved one at a time; wealth is re-evaluated after each.

#### Phase 3: Turn Order
- Reorder players: lowest on Knowledge track goes first (bottom of stack is most advanced).
- Player furthest on Rest track becomes first player, then removes their disc from the track.

#### Phase 4: Actions
Each player takes 5 actions in any order. Each action type may be used only once per turn.

**Available Actions:**
- **Movement (1–5 actions):** Move 1 space per action. Cost: 10 ducats if more than 1 action spent. Sea movement between harbors on same sea costs 3 actions. May mix land/sea.
- **Salterio (1 action):** Gain 3 knowledge (or 4 if last on Knowledge track).
- **Small Business (1 action):** Gain 10 ducats.
- **Orient (1–5 actions):** Advance toward end (6 spaces). Merchants at end gain +10 ducats when taking city economic benefit.
- **Riddle from Verona (1–5 actions):** Must be in blue zone. Gain VP based on final position: 4/5/6 VP.
- **Messenger (1–5 actions):** Advance toward end (8 spaces). To collect knowledge at Bologna:
  - Turns 1–7: Pay 20 ducats + 2 Abbesses → gain 15 knowledge.
  - Turns 8+: Pay 10 ducats + 1 Abbess → gain 10 knowledge.
- **Papal Library (1–5 actions):** Available Turn 12+. Reach numbered space → draw same number of Papal tiles. Keep 1, return others to top in any order. Can only do this once per game.
- **Canticle of the Sun (1–5 actions):** Available in active Franciscan city:
  - Turns 2, 6, 10–12: Only cities matching tile number.
  - Turns 14–16: Any Franciscan city.
  - Cost: 1 Abbess per space. Final scoring: 1st = 9 VP, 2nd = 4 VP.
- **Take Abbess (1 or 4 actions):** Pay 15 ducats (1 cube) or 30 ducats (2 cubes). Free if in Abbey.
- **Take Politician (1 or 4 actions):** Pay 30 ducats (1 cube) or 60 ducats (2 cubes).
- **Take Noble (1 or 4 actions):** Free. May discard immediately for 20 ducats each.
- **Take Amanuensis (1 or 4 actions):** Free. Place in front of screen.
- **Take Manuscript (1–4 actions):** Must be in matching color region, have sufficient knowledge, and pay actions equal to current row. Only one per turn.
- **Rest (1–5 actions):** Advance on track to gain turn order advantage next round.

**Map Interactions (before or after movement only):**
- **Event Tile:** Take benefit (ducats/knowledge), flip tile. Merchants only get money.
- **City Bonus:** Place disc to claim benefit (only once per city):
  - Coin: Merchant gains ducats.
  - Book: All gain knowledge.
  - Convent: Merchant → Friar (lose half money, round up).
  - Cathedral: Friar → Cardinal (pay 40 ducats + 1 red or black cube).
  - Abbey: Convert all Amanuenses (front of screen) to 3 knowledge each or move all behind screen for 1 VP each at game end.
- **Stupor Mundi (Turn 10):** Player in Brindisi may summon auction. Others may join in turn order. Bidding uses cube vote values (Red=3, Black=2, Yellow=1). Summoner gets +2 bid advantage. Winner gains 10 knowledge.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Knowledge Track:** Determines turn order (lowest goes first), manuscript eligibility, and tiebreaker.
- **Cubes:**
  - Red (3 votes), Black (2 votes), Yellow (1 vote): Used for status upgrades, Stupor Mundi, Messenger, Canticle.
  - Green: Converted at Abbey to 3 knowledge or 1 VP each.
- **Status Progression:**
  - Merchant → Friar (Convent, lose half money).
  - Friar → Cardinal (Cathedral, pay 40 ducats + red/black cube).
  - Cardinals cannot revert.
- **Manuscript Escalation:** When a level is depleted, higher levels shift down in cost. Lingua Volgare (8) enters when level 1 is depleted.
- **Cube Return:** Discarded cubes return to earliest available Turn Track space (priority: Red, Black, Yellow, Green).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
After final turn, conduct **Final Election**:

**Status Upgrades (optional, in knowledge order if tied):**
- Merchant → Banker: Pay 7 votes → 6 VP.
- Friar → Monk: Pay 10 votes → 11 VP.
- Cardinal → Camerlengo: Pay 11 votes → 14 VP.
- Cardinal → Pope: Pay 17 votes → 22 VP. Only one Pope. Loses VP from Cardinal tile.

**Final Scoring:**
- **Manuscripts:** 1 VP per level. Lingua Volgare = 8 VP.
- **Color Set:** 5 VP for owning at least one of each of 5 colors (dual-color count as one).
- **Canticle Track:** 1st = 9 VP, 2nd = 4 VP.
- **Riddle from Verona:** 1st = 4/5/6 VP based on position.
- **Papal Library Tile:** 2, 3, or 4 VP (as printed).
- **Wealth:** Richest player:
  - Merchant/Banker: 7 VP.
  - Other: 3 VP.
- **Unused Cubes:** 3 VP for highest total vote value (Red=3, Black=2, Yellow=1).
- **Amanuenses:** 1 VP each for those behind screen.
- **Character Tiles:** VP as printed (except Pope, who gains no tile VP).
- **Tiebreaker:** Most knowledge.
