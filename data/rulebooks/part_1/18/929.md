## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
El Gran Dalmuti is a social simulation card game with abstract mechanics that can be roleplayed. The core objective is to be the first player to empty your hand. Players are ranked from highest (Gran Dalmuti) to lowest (Gran Peón), and rankings shift each round based on finishing order. The game is typically played over multiple rounds, with cumulative scoring determining the overall winner.

### 2. Components  
- A custom 80-card deck:
  - Cards numbered 1 to 12, with quantity matching value: one 1, two 2s, ..., twelve 12s.
  - Two Jokers (value 13), the highest single cards but worst when played alone.
- Optional:
  - Score tracking sheet or paper.
  - Status markers (for tracking end-of-round rankings and seating).
  - Tokens or coins (for Decrees variant).
  - Decree cards (for Decrees variant).
  - Place cards (to label player roles).

### 3. Setup  
**Number of Players:** 5–8 recommended; minimum 5, ideal 6+.

**Initial Seating & Roles:**
1. Shuffle all cards and deal one to each player.
2. Rank players by card value: lowest number is best.
   - 1 = Gran Dalmuti (highest rank)
   - 2 = Pequeño Dalmuti
   - 3, 4, ... = Comerciantes (Merchants)
   - Second-to-last = Pequeño Peón
   - Last = Gran Peón (lowest rank)
3. Jokers count as 13 (worst).
4. Break ties by dealing additional cards until resolved.

**Seating Order:**
- Gran Dalmuti chooses seat.
- Others sit clockwise: Pequeño Dalmuti → Comerciantes → Pequeño Peón → Gran Peón (to the right of Gran Dalmuti).

**Card Distribution:**
- Gran Peón shuffles; Gran Dalmuti may cut.
- Deal all cards one at a time, starting with Gran Dalmuti, going clockwise.
- Unequal hand sizes are allowed.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
**Before Play:**
1. **Taxation:**
   - Gran Peón gives two best cards to Gran Dalmuti; receives any two cards back.
   - Pequeño Peón gives best card to Pequeño Dalmuti; receives one card back.
   - Jokers are never considered “best cards” for taxation.
   - All exchanges are face-down.
2. **Trade (Merchants Only):**
   - Only if ≥2 Merchants exist.
   - Each Merchant may perform **one** trade: exchange one face-down card with another Merchant.
   - First Merchant initiates offers; if rejected, may offer to others.
   - Trade is simultaneous with taxation.
3. **Revolutions:**
   - **Greater Revolution:** If Gran Peón receives both Jokers, they may declare a Greater Revolution.
     - All players swap with their symmetric opposite (Gran Dalmuti ↔ Gran Peón, etc.).
     - No taxation or trade occurs.
     - New Gran Dalmuti chooses seat; game proceeds.
   - **Minor Revolution:** Any other player receiving both Jokers may declare a Minor Revolution.
     - No taxation or trade.
     - Normal gameplay begins.

**During Play:**
- **First Hand:** Gran Dalmuti starts.
- **Playing a Trick:**
  - A play consists of 1+ cards of the same number, optionally accompanied by Jokers.
  - Jokers can substitute for any card in a group, taking on its value.
  - A play of only Jokers counts as 13s.
  - Next play must match the number of cards and be of lower value (better).
- **Trick Flow:**
  - Starting with the first player, each player in clockwise order may:
    - Play a better combination, or
    - Pass.
  - Once all players pass consecutively after a play, the trick ends.
  - The last player to play starts the next trick.
  - If that player has no cards, the next active player to their left starts.
- **End of Round:**
  - When all but one player have emptied their hands, the round ends.
  - Remaining player must play all remaining cards (no passing).

**Rank Assignment for Next Round:**
- Players ranked by order they emptied hands:
  1. First → Gran Dalmuti
  2. Second → Pequeño Dalmuti
  3. Third → Primer Comerciante
  4. Fourth → Segundo Comerciante, etc.
  - Second-to-last → Pequeño Peón
  - Last → Gran Peón

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Values:** 1 (best) to 12 (worst); Jokers = 13 when alone, can mimic other values when grouped.
- **Group Play:** Must play same number of cards as current trick. Value is determined by base card (Jokers copy it).
- **Passing:** Optional; no obligation to play even if able.
- **Hand Size:** Varies by player and round; no standard hand size.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Per-Round Scoring:**
- Each player earns points equal to the number of players who finished **after** them.
  - Example: In a 7-player game:
    - 1st place: 6 points
    - 2nd: 5 points
    - ...
    - 7th: 0 points

**Philanthropy Bonuses:**
- **Gran Dalmuti Bonus (+1):** If Gran Peón finishes in any position except last.
- **Pequeño Dalmuti Bonus (+1):** If Pequeño Peón finishes not last or second-to-last.

**Final Victory:**
- Game is usually played over a fixed number of rounds or until a cumulative score is reached.
- Total score = sum of all round scores + applicable bonuses.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Ties in Initial Draw:** Resolve with additional cards until ranking is clear.
- **Uneven Card Distribution:** Normal; occurs due to 80-card deck and variable players.
- **Jokers in Taxation:** Never considered "best cards"; Peón cannot give Joker if it's their only good card.
- **Trade Rules:**
  - Only one trade per Merchant.
  - Cannot trade if only one Merchant.
  - Trade is blind (face-down).
- **Revolution Timing:**
  - Greater Revolution: Only Gran Peón can trigger by receiving both Jokers.
  - Minor Revolution: Any non-Peon with both Jokers may trigger.
  - Revolutions cancel taxation and trade.
- **Scoring Example:**
  - 6 players: Finish order A, C, B, F, E, D
    - A: 5 pts (5 after), +1 bonus (F not last) → 6
    - C: 4 pts + ? → depends on Pequeño Peón status
- **Status Markers:** Optional tools to track finish order and seating; can be used instead of memory or notes.
