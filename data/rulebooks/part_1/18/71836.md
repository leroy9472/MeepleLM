## The Doors of Dreams — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the dream world of Onirim, you are a dreamwalker trapped in a surreal labyrinth of shifting chambers. Your goal is to escape by finding the eight Door cards—two of each color (red, blue, green, brown)—and placing them on the table. To do so, you must navigate through chambers, manage nightmares, and use strategy to avoid waking up trapped in the dream forever.

**Victory Condition:** Obtain all 8 Door cards simultaneously.  
**Defeat Condition:** Attempt to draw a card when the deck is empty.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has three phases:

#### Phase 1: Play or Discard  
Choose one card from your hand to either **play** or **discard**.

- **Play a Card**:  
  - Place it face-up to extend your labyrinth row.  
  - **Golden Rule**: The new card must **not share any symbol** (Sun, Moon, Key) with the previously played card.  
  - If this card is the **third consecutive card of the same color**, you **obtain the matching Door card**:  
    - Search the deck for the corresponding colored Door card.  
    - Place it in front of you.  
    - Immediately **shuffle the deck**.

- **Discard a Card**:  
  - Place it in the **discard pile** (not Limbo).  
  - If it’s a **Key card**, trigger a **Prophecy** before moving to Phase 2:  
    - Look at the top 5 cards of the deck.  
    - **Discard one** of them (mandatory).  
    - Return the other 4 to the top of the deck in **any order**.

#### Phase 2: Draw  
Draw cards one at a time from the top of the deck until you have **5 cards in hand**. Resolve each drawn card as follows:

- **Labyrinth card**: Add it to your hand. Continue drawing if needed.  
- **Door card**:  
  - Option 1: Discard a **Key card of the same color** from your hand → **gain the Door card** (place in front of you). Then continue drawing.  
  - Option 2: Place the Door card into **Limbo** → draw a replacement.  
- **Dream card (Nightmare)**: Immediately resolve one of the following options:  
  1. Discard a **Key card** from your hand.  
  2. Place **one of your obtained Door cards** into the Limbo pile.  
  3. Reveal the **top 5 cards** of the deck:  
     - Place any **Door** or **Dream** cards into **Limbo**.  
     - Discard all other (Labyrinth) cards.  
  4. **Discard your entire hand** → draw a new hand as in setup:  
     - Draw cards until you have **5 Labyrinth cards**.  
     - Any **Door** or **Dream** cards drawn go to **Limbo** (no triggering effects).  
     - You **cannot gain Doors** during this process.  
  - After resolving, **discard the Nightmare card** and continue drawing.

Repeat Phase 2 until your hand has 5 cards.

#### Phase 3: Shuffle  
Shuffle all cards currently in the **Limbo pile** back into the deck.  
End of turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

- **Labyrinth Row**: A sequence of played Labyrinth cards. Only the last card matters for symbol compatibility.  
- **Color Runs**: Only **three consecutive cards of the same color** (regardless of symbols) trigger Door discovery.  
  - A different color breaks the chain.  
- **Prophecy (Key discard)**: Strategic tool to manipulate the top of the deck.  
- **Limbo vs Discard**:  
  - **Limbo**: Cards temporarily out of play (Doors, Dreams during draw, or from Nightmares). Returned to deck at end of turn.  
  - **Discard pile**: Used for played/discarded Labyrinth cards and resolved Nightmares.  
- **Deck Shuffle Triggers**:  
  - After obtaining a Door via 3-in-a-row.  
  - After each turn (when Limbo is shuffled back in).

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

- **Victory**: You win immediately upon having **all 8 Door cards** on the table. No need to complete the turn.  
- **Defeat**: You lose if you are required to draw a card (to reach 5 in hand) and **the deck is empty**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

- **Can I play a card that breaks the symbol rule?**  
  No. You must choose a card that does **not share any symbol** with the previous card.

- **What if I can’t play or discard because all cards share a symbol with the last played card?**  
  You must **discard** one of them. Discarding bypasses the symbol rule.

- **Can I trigger a Door by drawing a third color in hand?**  
  No. Only **playing** the third consecutive card of a color triggers the Door.

- **Can I use a Key of different color to claim a Door when drawing it?**  
  No. You must discard a **Key of the same color** as the Door drawn.

- **What happens if the deck runs out during a Nightmare’s “reveal top 5” effect?**  
  Reveal as many as possible. Only existing cards are subject to Limbo or discard.

- **Can I gain a Door during a full-hand discard recovery?**  
  No. During setup-style recovery, Door and Dream cards go directly to Limbo without effect.
