### 1. Lore & Objective
The Mafia business is thriving, but the Capo appears old and tired. Five families compete to take control through influence, power plays, and backroom deals.

### 3. Setup
1. Place the board within reach of all players.  
2. Each player chooses a family, takes the corresponding Player Board, 25 Influence markers, Scoring Meeples, and $5.  
3. Place "Killer" Mac Pheeto face-up in the Capo (Position #9).  
4. Shuffle remaining Gangster cards. Deal face-up to Positions 8 (Underboss) through 5 (Racketeer), ensuring each Gangster type (Thug, Hitman, Conman, Gambler) appears at least once. Replace duplicates until all types are represented.  
5. Shuffle remaining Gangster cards and deal face-up to Positions 4–1 and all three Associate spaces.  
6. Place remaining Gangster cards face-down as the Gangster Deck.  
7. Shuffle Influence cards and deal 4 to each player. Place the rest face-down as the Influence Deck.  
8. Place a Checkmark marker on "The Commission" space of the Phase Track; set the other 4 nearby.  
9. Place all players’ Scoring Meeples on "0" of the Respect track.  
10. Place Neutral Influence markers, coins, dice, and money near the board.  
11. The player who looks most like a mobster takes the Capo Ring (first player). If unsure, the first to quote a gangster movie accurately goes first.  
12. Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player places 1 Influence marker on any Gangster. Repeat this two more times so each player has placed 3 Influence markers total.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the 5 rounds consists of 6 phases, resolved in order:

#### 1. The Commission
- Players take turns (starting with Capo Ring holder) performing one action:
  - Play an Influence card to place markers on specified Gangster type(s) or position (red icon).
  - Play an "OR" card to use only its special ability.
  - Discard any Influence card to place 1 Influence marker on any Gangster (ignoring card text).
  - Pass (and take no further actions this phase).
- After all players have acted once, players still in may now use "The Ante":
  - When playing a card, pay money to bank to set an Ante. Subsequent players must match or exceed it to play a card; otherwise, they must pass.
- Once all players pass, phase ends.

#### 2. The Crew
- **Determine Control**: Starting with Capo (#9), descending to #1:
  - Player with most Influence markers controls the Gangster.
  - No control if: no markers, or neutral markers are majority/tied for majority.
  - Ties broken by player holding Capo Ring.
  - Controlling Capo immediately takes Capo Ring.
- **Calculate Money & Respect**:
  - Based on Gangster card and Position modifiers.
  - Can gain or lose money and Respect.
  - Associates do not generate money or Respect.
- **Gangster Actions**: Starting with Third Guy (#1), ascending to Capo:
  - Controlling player chooses one action:
    - Use Position special ability.
    - Use Gangster’s special ability (if any).
    - "Make a Move" on adjacent higher-positioned Gangster.
    - Pass ("Eat a cannoli").
  - "Make a Move":
    - Roll Move die, add Gangster’s printed Respect value (not Position bonus).
    - Total must exceed target Position number.
    - Capo Ring symbol (●) = automatic success; Knife (⚔) = automatic failure and death.
    - Success: Swap Gangsters, both turned sideways (inert), attacker gains 4 Respect, defender loses 4 Respect, add 1 Neutral marker to successful Gangster.
    - Failure: No swap, attacker loses 4 Respect, add 1 Neutral marker.
    - Death: Gangster removed ("Sleepin’ wif da fishes"), all markers returned, attacker loses 4 Respect.
  - "Whacking a Gangster":
    - Pay $10 ($20 if targeting Capo), roll Whack die.
    - Gun or Capo Ring = success: target killed, controller loses 4 Respect, attacker gains 4 Respect.
    - X = failure: attacker loses 4 Respect.
    - Knife = failure and attacker’s Gangster dies.
  - Blackmail: If Gangster has Blackmail coin, controlling player needs permission from Blackmail owner to act; else must pass.
  - Omertá: Omertá coin prevents action except pass.

#### 3. The Fence
- **Draw Cards**: Based on number of Gangsters controlled (not Associates):
  - 0 = 4 cards
  - 1 = 3 cards
  - 2+ = 2 cards
  - Tied Gangsters do not count toward any player.
- **Buy Cards**: Players may buy additional Influence cards for $10 each (must declare quantity before drawing).

#### 4. The Feds
- **Attention Check**: Check each Gangster (Capo down to #1):
  - 3 players: 9+ Influence → sent to Prison
  - 4 players: 10+ → Prison
  - 5 players: 11+ → Prison
  - All Influence markers returned; Gangster placed in Prison.
- **Rotate Gangsters**: All sideways Gangsters turned upright.

#### 5. The Family
- **Fill Capo Position** (if empty): Highest-ranked active Gangster becomes Capo; controller takes Capo Ring.
- **Fill Other Positions**: From highest to lowest rank:
  - Choose Gangster from directly connected lower rank.
  - If none, choose any lower-ranked Gangster.
  - If none, choose an Associate.
  - If none, draw from Gangster Deck.
  - Controlling player of designated "appointing" position decides (e.g., Capo decides Underboss; Enforcer decides First Guy). If uncontrolled, Capo Ring holder decides.
- **Fill Associate Spaces**: Draw from deck.
- No Gangster may be promoted more than once this phase.

#### 6. Bookkeeping
- Place Checkmark on next space of Bookkeeping track.
- Place new Checkmark on "The Commission" to start next round.
- After 5th Checkmark, game ends.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Influence Control**: Players place Influence markers via cards to gain control.
- **Die Rolls**:
  - Move die (● success, ⚔ failure/death)
  - Whack die (gun/● = success, X = failure, ⚔ = death)
  - Number die (used for tiebreaks)
- **Blackmail**:
  - Coin placed with player’s Influence marker.
  - Does not count as marker; marker on coin counts for control.
  - One per Gangster; removed if marker is removed.
  - Blackmailer controls action permission.
- **Omertá**: Prevents action except pass.
- **Second Chance**: Pay $10 to re-roll any die; multiple players can re-roll same die.
- **Shakedown**: Discard any Influence card at any time for $8.
- **Negotiation**: Players may trade money, cards, promises; deals are non-binding.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
After 5 rounds:
1. Final Respect Calculation: Award Respect for each controlled Gangster (money not awarded; no actions).
2. Sell Cards: $8 per Influence card.
3. Convert Money to Respect: 1 Respect per $10 (rounded down).
4. Highest total Respect wins.

**Tiebreakers**:
1. Player with Capo Ring.
2. Player controlling highest-numbered active Gangster.
3. Player with most money.
4. Player with most Influence markers on board.
5. Player with most Influence cards in hand.
6. Highest roll on Number die.
7. First player to throw game off roof.
