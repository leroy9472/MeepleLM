## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Summer Camp, players compete to earn the most experience points by collecting merit badges, acquiring valuable cards, and advancing on activity paths. In solo mode ("Spoiled Brats"), you play against 1–3 AI opponents representing spoiled rich campers who gain cards without paying energy and receive extra movement benefits. The objective remains the same: score the most experience points by the end of the game through badges, cards, and final pawn positions.

2. Components  
- Game board with lake and 9 path boards (3×3 layout)  
- 4 player boards (1 per player)  
- 12 pawns (4 sets of 3)  
- 7 activity packs (Adventure, Arts & Crafts, Cooking, Friendship, Games, Outdoors, Water Sports)  
  - Each: 28 cards, 4 merit badges  
- Base pack:  
  - 64 base cards (Lights out!, S'mores, Scavenger Hunt, Free Time)  
  - 6 merit badges (3 Participation, 3 Camp All-Star)  
- 24 snack bar tokens  
- Starting Camper Patch  
- AI Action Decks (created during setup)  

3. Setup  
- Choose 3 activity packs to play (e.g., Cooking, Outdoors, Water Sports).  
- Assemble the game board: place lake board on top, then arrange 9 path boards in any 3×3 configuration below.  
- For each chosen activity:  
  - Place its 4 merit badges at the end of one path (stacked high-to-low based on player count).  
  - Shuffle remaining 24 cards into a draw pile to the left of the path; reveal 2 face-up cards beside it.  
- From base pack:  
  - Place Participation and Camp All-Star badges on designated lake board spaces (stacked high-to-low by player count).  
  - Create face-up supply piles for S'mores, Scavenger Hunt, and Free Time cards to the right of the board.  
- Each player:  
  - Chooses a color (player board and 3 pawns).  
  - Creates starting deck: 7 Lights out! + 1 Move 1 Space card from each chosen activity (10 cards total).  
  - Shuffles deck, places on draw pile section of player board.  
  - Draws starting hand:  
    - Start player: 3 cards  
    - Next: 4 cards  
    - 3-player: 5th card  
    - 4-player: 6th card  
- AI Setup (Solo Mode):  
  - For each AI opponent:  
    - Assign a player board and 3 pawns (no starting deck or energy tokens).  
    - Create AI Action Deck:  
      - From each of the 3 chosen activity decks, remove and shuffle:  
        - 1 random 1-point card  
        - 1 random 2-point card  
        - Total: 6 cards  
      - Add “Free Time” cards based on difficulty:  
        - Hard: # of AI opponents  
        - Normal: 1  
        - Easy: 0  
      - Shuffle to form AI Action Deck.  
  - You are the starting player.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise. All players (including AI) take equal turns.  
- On a player’s turn:  
  1. Play cards for actions or energy.  
  2. Buy cards from display using energy.  
  3. End turn: discard hand and played cards, draw 5 new cards, refill display, check for badges.  
- After each human player turn, resolve AI turns in clockwise order.  

5. Core Mechanics  
AI Turn Sequence:  
- Draw top card from AI Action Deck.  
- Interpret card:  
  - Activity (e.g., Cooking) → corresponds to that path.  
  - Point value (1 or 2) → column in display (1 = leftmost, 2 = middle).  
  - AI gains the card in that row/column.  
  - AI moves corresponding pawn forward by number of spaces equal to column (1 or 2).  
- Special Cards:  
  - “Free Time” card: AI moves all 3 pawns forward 1 space each.  
- Bonus Movement:  
  - When AI gains extra movement (e.g., from landing on bonus space), move the AI’s camper closest to the starting line.  
  - If tied, human player chooses.  
- AI Deck Management:  
  - When deck runs out, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
- AI Limitations:  
  - Do not pay energy for cards.  
  - Do not interact with Energy Tokens.  
  - Do not use card effects that involve drawing/discarding (e.g., Friendship or Games deck effects that target players).  
  - Effects referencing “player to your left/right” are resolved assuming AI order is clockwise.  
  - AI gains snack bars when card effect grants them but does not spend them.  
    - Each 2 snack bars = 1 experience point at endgame.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Endgame Trigger:  
- When any player collects all 3 final-path merit badges (i.e., reaches end of all 3 paths), complete the current round so all players have taken equal turns.  

Final Scoring (All Players and AI):  
- Merit Badges: Sum experience points from all badges collected (Participation, All-Star, Activity).  
- Cards: Sum experience points (star icon) on all cards in deck (hand, draw pile, discard pile).  
- Final Position: For each pawn not on final bridge space, score points shown above its current space on lake board.  
- AI Bonus: 1 VP per snack bar token held.  
- Total all points. Highest score wins. Tiebreaker: most snack bar tokens.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: What if the AI draws a card from an empty column?  
  A: The AI still performs the movement based on column number. If no card is present, they gain nothing but still move.  
- Q: Can AI benefit from Friendship or Games deck effects?  
  A: No. Any effect requiring the AI to draw, discard, or receive cards is skipped. AI does not have a deck.  
- Q: How are multiple AI opponents handled?  
  A: Each has its own AI Action Deck and player board. Resolve their turns one at a time in clockwise order.  
- Q: What if the AI gains a card that gives an immediate bonus (e.g., snack bar)?  
  A: The AI gains the snack bar but does not use it during gameplay. It counts toward endgame scoring (1 VP per 2 tokens).  
- Q: Do AI pawns block or interact with player pawns?  
  A: No. Multiple pawns (AI or player) may occupy same space. No interaction occurs.  
- Q: Can AI earn participation or all-star badges?  
  A: Yes. If AI moves all 3 pawns past first or second bridge space, they collect the highest available badge of that type.
