     - Plus bonus spaces from Caravaneer card:  
       - Level 1: +2 spaces max  
       - Level 2: +4 spaces max  
   - Cannot land on current space.  
   - Must be able to fulfill destination's requirement.  
   - Wine can substitute any resource.  

   **City Actions:**  
   - **Babylon:**  
     - Spend 1 resource → 3 VP  
     - Spend 2 resources → 6 VP (can do both)  
     - Plus: irrigate one unirrigated garden space.  
   - **Card Cities (e.g., Nineveh, Assur):**  
     - Pay required resource(s) → buy next available court card (Banker, Caravaneer, Palace).

     - Pay required resource(s) → buy and plant a plant card.  
     - Must plant on **irrigated tile** (at least one full side irrigated).  
     - Plant level must match garden level unless boosted with Gardener cards:  
       - Discard 1 Gardener card = +1 planting level  
       - E.g., Level 1 plant + 2 Gardeners → can plant on level 3  
     - Level 4 garden tile = counts as level 3 (requires level 3 plant)  
     - After planting:  
       - Player with most irrigation cubes around tile scores VP equal to plant’s base level (1 or 2). Tie = no score.

**End Game Trigger:**  
- Game ends at end of round when:
