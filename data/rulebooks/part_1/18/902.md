## Meuterer – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Meuterer is a strategic card-driven board game of power struggles, trade, and mutiny aboard a merchant ship sailing between islands. Players assume roles with unique abilities and compete to gain the most victory points over 8 (4 players) or 9 (3 players) rounds. The core tension lies in the balance between cooperation and betrayal: the Captain leads the voyage and earns docking rewards, but any player can attempt a mutiny to seize control.

**Objective:** Be the player with the highest total victory points at the end of the game by:
- Successfully docking at valuable islands (as Captain or Mutineer),
- Winning trade conflicts by selling wares,
- Leveraging role-specific abilities, and
- Strategically participating in or preventing mutinies.

### 4. Gameplay Flow (Per Round)  

#### Phase 1: Captain Chooses Mate’s Bonus  
- The Captain selects one of the numbered Captain cards (0, 1, 2, or 3) and places it face up. This is the number of victory points they will pay to the Mate if the mutiny is prevented.

#### Phase 2: Offer Wares & Choose Actions  
Starting with the Captain and proceeding clockwise:  
Each player, on their turn, may either:  
- **A) Play one Warenkarte face-up** in front of them (to sell later), or  
- **B) Pass** by placing all remaining hand cards **facedown** in front of them.  

**When a player passes:**  
- They take **all available Aktionskarte cards**, choose **one**, and return the rest **face down** to the center.  
- **Captain’s pass:** After passing, the Captain places the **white Fahrtziel card** X islands **clockwise** from the current ship location, where X = number of facedown cards in their hand.  
- **Other players’ pass:** They simply choose an Action card as above.

> **Note:** Players may continue playing wares until they pass. The Captain must pass eventually to set the destination.

#### Phase 3: Reveal Action Cards  
- All players reveal their chosen Action cards.  
- If the **Meuterer** card was taken, that player places the **blue Fahrtziel card** Y islands **clockwise** from the current ship, where Y = number of facedown cards the Mutineer has.

#### Phase 4: Resolve Mutiny (if Meuterer was chosen)  
- A mutiny occurs **only if Meuterer is chosen**.  
- Starting with the Captain, each player **involved in the mutiny** may play **one Konflikt (Conflict) card** per turn, clockwise.  
  - **Captain and Maat:** Play cards in front of the Captain.  
  - **Meuterer and Schiffsjunge:** Play cards in front of the Mutineer.  
  - **Handler and Lademeister:** Cannot play Conflict cards; any previously played are ignored.  
- Total conflict points:  
  - Each Conflict card = 1 point  
  - **Maat card = +1 automatic conflict point** (even if no card is played)  
- **Winner:** Side with more total points. **Ties are won by the Mutineer.**

#### Phase 5: Distribute Victory Points  
**Case A: No mutiny or mutiny failed**  
- **Captain:** Scores **Captain value** of island under **white Fahrtziel**.  
- **Maat:** Gains **1 VP** + **bonus VP** from Captain’s chosen card (0–3).  
- **Captain loses** the bonus VP they gave to the Maat.  
- **Meuterer and Schiffsjunge:** Score **0** from docking.  

**Case B: Mutiny successful**  
- **Meuterer:** Scores **Captain value** of island under **blue Fahrtziel**.  
- **Meuterer becomes new Captain** and takes both Captain cards.  
- **Schiffsjunge:** Gains **2 VP**.  
- **Old Captain and Maat:** Score **0** from docking.  

**All players: Sell Wares**  
- For each good type (e.g., Ruby), players reveal how many they played.  
- Only players who played **at least one** of a good can score for it.  
- Scoring per good:  
  - **1 player has most:** 2 VP  
  - **2 players tied for most:** 1 VP each  
  - **3+ players tied:** 0 VP  
- **Exception:** The **Handler (Merchant)** always scores the **highest available VP** for any good they sold, **even if tied**.

#### Phase 6: Move Ship & Update Islands  
- **Turn all islands except current and new destination to passive (dark side).**  
- **Move Ship card** to the island under the **Fahrtziel card** (white if no mutiny, blue if mutiny succeeded).  
- **Flip that island to active (light side).**

#### Phase 7: Clean Up & Draw Cards  
- **Discard all played Warenkarte and Conflict cards.**  
- **Remove Fahrtziel cards** from the board.  
- **Return all Aktionskarte cards face down to the center.**  
- **Draw phase:** Starting with the Captain, each player draws to **5 cards.**  
  - **Lademeister:** Draws **3 extra cards**, chooses which to keep to complete a 5-card hand, discards the rest **under the discard pile.**

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Role Selection:** Only one player per role per round. Choosing early gives access to desired roles; choosing late allows reaction to others.  
- **Destination Control:** The Captain and Mutineer set destinations based on **number of facedown cards** in hand.  
- **Conflict System:**  
  - Conflict cards are played during mutiny resolution.  
  - Maat provides automatic +1 conflict point.  
  - Tie goes to Mutineer.  
  - Handler and Lademeister are neutral.  
- **Trade Scoring:**  
  - Goods are only valuable in **quantity dominance**.  
  - Merchant wins all ties.  
- **Hand Management:**  
  - Number of facedown cards = strategic tool for setting destination and bluffing.  
  - Lademeister gains card selection advantage.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends after:  
  - **8 rounds** (with 4 players)  
  - **9 rounds** (with 3 players)  
- **Final scoring:** Sum all victory points from:  
  - Docking rewards (Captain or Mutineer)  
  - Role bonuses (Mate, Schiffsjunge)  
  - Trade sales  
- **Highest total wins.**  
- **Note:** Captain can have **negative score** if they pay more to the Mate than they earn.

**Q: Can the Captain play Conflict cards during a mutiny?**  
A: Yes. The Captain and Maat are on the same side and may play Conflict cards.
