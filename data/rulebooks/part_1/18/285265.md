## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The time has come to determine the most powerful druid to claim the throne. Players take on the role of druids competing to collect power points through summoning creatures, utilizing abilities, forging artifacts, and claiming Rune Stones. The game ends when a player reaches or exceeds 65 power points. After all players complete their turns, final scoring occurs. The player with the most power points wins. There is no tiebreaker.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### **Summon Creatures**  
- Choose any number of cards from your hand **of a single color** (or multicolor/white).  
- Total the **Magic Points** (shown in upper corners). White (dragon/druid) cards count as any color.  
- Spend total Magic Points to buy any Creature cards from the display, up to the sum.  
  - Cost of each card = position in display (leftmost = 1, rightmost = 6).  
  - Purchased cards **do not need to match** the color of Magic Points used.  
- Place **all played cards** and **summoned cards** into your discard pile.  
- Refill display: shift remaining cards right, then refill empty spaces from top of deck.  
  - If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  

#### **Utilize Abilities**  
- Play **exactly 2 cards** from hand.  
- Use abilities of both cards in any order; may skip either or both.  
- **Card with higher number:**  
  - If Creature → place in **general discard pile**  
  - If Druid (100–107) → **remove from game**  
- **Card with lower number:** → place in **player’s own discard pile**  

**Ability Types:**  
- **Basic:** Perform as shown (e.g., take gem, roll die, gain ore, gain card).  
- **Choice (OR):** Choose one of two options.  
- **Swap:** Return gems to supply to gain points/gems.

#### **Forge Artifacts**  
- May forge **up to 2 Artifacts** from **different Smithies**.  
- To forge:  
  - Spend **gems** matching color and number shown below Smithy, **or**  
  - Spend **3 Ore** (alternative cost; works for any Smithy)  
- Wild gems can substitute for any colored gem.  
- Place Artifact on matching color space in one of two rows on your board.  
  - If no space available, cannot forge that Artifact.  
- **Wild Artifact:**  
  - Costs 4 gems (any color)  
  - Can be placed on any empty space (including Wild space)  
  - Can only forge **one per turn**  
- **Smithy Bonuses (only if paying with gems):**  
  - Die Roll → gain shown reward  
  - Ore → take 1 ore  
  - 3 Points → gain 3 power points  
  - Bonuses can be used immediately (e.g., to help forge second Artifact)  
- After forging, refill empty Smithies from Artifact supply.  
  - If supply runs out, shuffle face-up discard pile to form new supply.  

#### **Exchange Artifacts for Rune Stones (Free Action)**  
- May be done **after** main action, **before** refilling hand.  
- For **each row** on player board with **at least 2 Artifacts**:  
  - May discard **all Artifacts in that row** to:  
    - Gain **3/6/10/15 points** for discarding 2/3/4/5 Artifacts  
    - Gain **1 Rune Stone** (if fewer than 4 and type not already owned)  
- Discarded colored Artifacts → face-up discard pile  
- Discarded Wild Artifacts → return to Wild Smithy stack  
- Discarded Rune Stones → placed face-up next to board (reshuffled if supply runs out)  

#### **Refill Hand**  
- Draw cards from personal deck until hand has 4 cards.  
- If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
- If fewer than 4 cards total, draw all available.
