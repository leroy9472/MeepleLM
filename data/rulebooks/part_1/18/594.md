## Sleuth — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Sleuth is a logic deduction game in which players take on the roles of detectives attempting to identify a single missing gem card. Through strategic questioning and careful tracking of information, players use deductive reasoning to determine the exact combination of gem, type, and color of the hidden card. The objective is to be the first to correctly identify the missing gem.

2. Components  
- 36 Gem Cards: Each features a unique combination of:  
  • Gem: Diamond, Pearl, Opal  
  • Type: Solitaire, Pair, Cluster  
  • Color: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow  
- 54 Search Cards: Used to interrogate opponents. Three types:  
  • One Element Cards: Feature one attribute (e.g., "Blue", "Cluster")  
  • Two Element Cards: Feature two combined attributes (e.g., "Blue Clusters", "Diamond Pairs")  
  • Free Choice Cards: Can be used as either one or two-element questions. "Free Choice [Color]" cards require that color as one of the elements when used as a two-element question.  
- 1 Pad of Information Sheets: Used by players to track known card distributions and eliminate possibilities.

3. Setup  
1. Each player receives an Information Sheet to track evidence. Sheets are folded in half to keep notes private.  
2. The dealer shuffles the Gem Deck and removes **one card unseen** — this is the missing gem. It is placed out of sight.  
3. Deal the remaining Gem Cards face down:  
   - 3 players: 11 cards each  
   - 4 players: 8 cards each  
   - 5 players: 7 cards each  
   - 6 or 7 players: 5 cards each  
4. Any remaining Gem Cards (not dealt or removed) are revealed and placed face up in the center. All players record these on their sheets. These cards are out of play.  
5. Each player picks up their hand and secretly records their own cards on their sheet.  
6. Shuffle the Search Deck. Deal **4 Search Cards face up** to each player. The rest form the Drawing Deck, placed face down in the center.  
7. Play begins with the player to the dealer’s left and proceeds clockwise.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, they may choose **one** of the following actions:

**Option 1: Interrogate an Opponent**  
1. Select one of your face-up Search Cards.  
2. Use it to ask a valid question of any opponent:  
   - **One Element Card**: Ask how many of their Gem Cards match the element (e.g., "How many Pairs do you have?"). The opponent announces the number to all players.  
   - **Two Element Card**: Ask the opponent to pass you all matching Gem Cards (e.g., "Please pass your Blue Opals"). They pass them face down, announcing the number aloud. You view and record their identities, then return them immediately.  
   - **Free Choice Card**: May be used as either a One or Two Element question. If used as a Two Element, you may not combine two of the same category (e.g., two gems). For "Free Choice Blues", one element must be blue.  
3. Discard the used Search Card.  
4. Draw one Search Card from the Drawing Deck to replace it.

**Option 2: Refresh Search Cards**  
1. Discard all 4 of your face-up Search Cards.  
2. Draw 4 new Search Cards from the Drawing Deck.

After completing either action, the turn ends and play passes clockwise.

If the Drawing Deck runs out, discard the used Search Cards are reshuffled to form a new deck.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Information Gathering**: Every interrogation yields public information (the number of matching cards) and, in the case of Two Element questions, private information (exact identities). All players should record this data.  
- **Deduction**: Players use process of elimination. Since all 36 Gem Cards are known, and some are visible (center), in hands, or missing, tracking who holds what allows deduction of the missing card.  
- **Free Choice Cards**: Flexible tools. "Free Choice Yellows" can ask about any combination involving yellow (e.g., Yellow Diamonds, Yellow Solitaires, or just number of Yellow cards).  
- **Turn Flexibility**: Players may skip interrogation to refresh their Search Cards, improving future questioning options.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- At any time (even out of turn), a player may **announce they are solving the mystery** by circling the suspected missing gem on their Information Sheet.  
- If a player chooses to interrogate **without using one of their face-up Search Cards**, they may do so **only if** they commit to making a guess **immediately after** receiving the answer. This counts as their turn.  
- When a player announces a solution:  
  1. Play stops.  
  2. The player checks the missing gem **secretly**.  
     - If **correct**: Reveals the card and wins. Game ends.  
     - If **incorrect**: Replaces the card secretly. The player is **eliminated** — they cannot win or take further actions (except answering interrogations truthfully). Game continues.  
- The game ends when a player correctly identifies the missing gem.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I ask a question not on any of my face-up cards?**  
  Yes, but only if you commit to guessing the missing gem after the answer. This uses your turn.  
- **Do I have to use a Search Card to interrogate?**  
  Normally yes, unless you are making a final guess attempt.  
- **What happens when the Drawing Deck is empty?**  
  Used Search Cards are gathered, shuffled, and become the new Drawing Deck.  
- **Can I see the Gem Cards when a Two Element question is answered?**  
  Yes — only the interrogator sees them, briefly, before returning them.  
- **Can I combine two of the same category with a Free Choice card?**  
  No. For example, you cannot ask for "Blue Greens" or "Diamond Opals". Only one element from each category (gem, type, color) is allowed.
