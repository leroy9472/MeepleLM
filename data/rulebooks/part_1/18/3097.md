### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Track & Gauges
- **Types:** Narrow (dashed), Standard (solid), Dual (white).
- **Laying:** One tile per OR. Must extend a legal route from a station.
- **Upgrading:** Replace yellow→green (Phase 6), green→brown (Phase 10).
- **Terrain Costs:**
  - Standard/Dual: Full cost.
  - Narrow only: 25% cost.
  - P2 Private halves standard gauge costs.
- **Connections:** Narrow can dead-end into standard (and vice versa). Dual accepts both.

#### Station Tokens
- Each corp starts with 3 tokens (paid at startup).
- Place one per OR on a city reachable by route.
- Blocks rivals from routing beyond the city.
- Cannot block an unoperated corp's home city.
- Garibaldi may start in Caltanissetta, Ragusa, Terranova, Trapani, or Messina.

#### Routes & Trains
- **Route Rules:**
  - Must include ≥2 non-port locations (cities/towns).
  - May change gauge only at cities/towns.
  - Cannot traverse same hex/town twice.
  - Ports are endpoints only.
- **Train Movement:**
  - **4H/6H/8H/10H/16H:** Standard = 1 hex, Narrow = 2 hexes.
  - **R6H:** Narrow = 1 hex, Standard = 2 hexes.
  - **E-Train (variant):** Unlimited range on non-narrow track; doubles revenue in Catania, Messina, Palermo, Siracusa.
- **Revenue:** Sum of location values on route. Must claim maximum possible.

#### Stock Market & Dividends
- **Dividend Declaration:**
  - **Pay:** Distribute full revenue to shareholders (10% per 10% share). Treasury shares earn for corp.
  - **Withhold:** All revenue to corp treasury.
- **Stock Movement:**
  - **Right 1 column:** Dividend ≥ current stock price.
  - **Left 1 column:** No dividend paid.
  - **Down 1 row:** If at column end.
  - **Up 1 row:** If at column end and would move right.
- **End of SR Adjustment:**
  - **Down 1 row:** If any shares in Bank Pool.
  - **Up 1 row:** If all shares held by players (and not at top).

#### Certificates & Ownership
- **Certificate Limit:** 7 (3p), 6 (4p), 5 (5p). Includes privates.
- **60% Max Ownership:** No player may own >60% of a corp.
- **Last Certificate:** 20% share, costs 2×market price. Always at bottom of stack. Cannot be split or traded for two 10% certs.
- **President:** Owner of president's certificate (20%). Changes if another player exceeds their shareholding.

#### Starting a Corporation
- Take next available corp (lowest place card).
- Set initial par: L.68, L.100 (Phase 4+), L.144 (Phase 6+), L.216 (Phase 10+).
- Buy 20%-40% (president's cert + 0–2 regular certs) → funds to treasury.
- Corp buys 3 tokens (L.30–L.130 fee) → place one in home city.

#### Financial Activities
- **Sell Treasury Shares:** Any number → Bank Pool at market price. Move stock ↓1 row per share. Cannot sell "Last" if regular certs remain.
- **Buy Back from Pool:** One certificate from Bank Pool at market price. Cannot do if sold shares this turn.

#### Private Companies
- **Auction:** Waterfall style. Bid ≥L.5 over face or prior bid. Auction if multiple bids.
- **Revenue:** Paid at start of each OR to owner (player or corp).
- **Corporate Purchase:** Phases 6–10 only. Buy from players (L.1 to 2×face). Cannot buy from other corps.
- **Close:** When first 12H train is bought (Phase 12 start).

#### Train Purchases
- **From Bank:** Buy cheapest available (4H→6H→etc.). After first 16H, R6H also available.
- **From Other Corps:** Any price ≥L.1. President must agree.
- **Forced Purchase (Emergency):**
  - Corp has route but no train and insufficient funds.
  - President contributes personal cash.
  - If still insufficient, sells shares (cannot change presidency).
  - Must buy cheapest bank train. Ends with L.0 treasury.
  - If still impossible, corp closes.
- **Train Limits:**
  - Phases 4–6: 4 trains
  - Phase 8: 3 trains
  - Phase 10–16: 2 trains
- **Excess Trains:** Discard to Bank Pool (no compensation) when limit reduces.

#### Corporation Closure
**Triggers:**
- Stock enters "Closed" box.
- Cannot buy train after emergency fundraising.
- Garibaldi loses only station in Messina earthquake.

**Effects:**
- Remove corp, tokens, trains, privates, stock.
- Shareholders get nothing.
- Treasury to bank.
- Corp available to restart in next SR (last in order).
- Home city spot reserved.

#### Messina Earthquake
- **Trigger:** Purchase of first 12H train.
- **Effects:**
  - Remove Messina tile (downgrade to yellow).
  - Remove all tokens in Messina.
  - Garibaldi closes if Messina is only station.
  - Cannot upgrade Messina until after next SR.

#### Variants
- **Bonds (4.7):** Corp may issue L.500 bond (stock ↓1 column). Pay L.50 interest/turn. Repay to move stock ↑1 column. Outstanding bond reduces final stock value by L.100.
- **Electric Dreams (7):** Buy E-token (L.1100/L.800), then E-trains (L.550). Unlimited range on non-narrow track. Doubles revenue in 4 major cities.
