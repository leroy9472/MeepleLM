4. **Move Assistant**: Move Assistant to Architect's District.
5. Pass turn clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Actions (available in respective Districts)

#### Free Actions (any time during turn)

#### Scoring Trigger
Occurs when a Barge becomes empty:
1. Active player gains 1 Gold from Time Track.
2. All players return all local Resources to supply.
   - For each yellow/brown/white Resource lost: advance 1 step on matching Mastery track.
   - For each blue Resource lost: gain 1 Water tile.
   - For each green Resource lost: gain 1 Garden tile.
   - (Only 1 advancement/tile per player, regardless of quantity lost)
3. Score District:
   - **Common Districts (1-3)**: Each Building scores VP = (size + adjacent Garden tiles) × VP value at Mastery marker position.
   - **Port**: 1 VP per Claim marker in same row/column as your House (2 VP if in both).
   - **Ziggurat**: Score rightmost Claim marker on each Ziggurat tile using tile's scoring rule.
4. Return all dice to Barge and roll new values.
5. If Time Track empty, trigger Final Scoring.

#### Final Scoring
When last Gold is removed from Time Track:
1. Continue until all players have equal turns.
2. Play one additional full round (empty Barges trigger partial scoring: only steps 2 and 7).
3. Score all 5 Districts one final time using regular rules.
4. Reveal and score Urban cards.
5. Winner has most VP. Tiebreaker: most Gold, then shared victory.
