    - **Edict:** Resolve effects in order, then discard  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Burning Metals:**  
  - Burn 1 metal per turn initially; increases via Training track (max 4)  
  - Burn metal token by placing on card; return to track at end of turn  
  - Can Burn without powering a card (e.g., to trigger Ally effects)  
- **Flaring:**  
  - Flip metal token to dark side to use beyond Burn limit  
  - Flared metals stay flipped; cannot be used until refreshed  
  - Flaring counts as Burning for effects  
- **Refreshing Flared Metals:**  
  - Discard a card to refresh a Flared metal matching one of its vial metals  
  - Or use effect with ⊙ symbol  
  - Can refresh metal flared this turn  
- **Atium:**  
  - Single-use; return to supply after use  
  - Cannot be Flared  
  - Can substitute for any metal  
  - When used as non-Atium metal, counts as both  
  - Atium cards can power any card (sideways) or refresh any metal (discard)  
- **Card Types:**  
  - **Action Cards:** Vertical; played for effects; discarded at turn end  
  - **Ally Cards:** Horizontal; stay in play until defeated; provide ongoing effects  
- **Using Cards as Metals:**  
  - Play sideways to show vial; powers another card  
  - Does not count toward Burn limit  
  - Triggers Savant ability  
- **Market:**  
  - Buy cards with Coins; go to discard pile immediately  
  - Replace bought card immediately from Market deck  
  - Boxings cost 2 Coins; discard later to gain 1 Coin  
- **Combat:**  
  - Damage (×) accumulated during turn; used in Attack Phase  
  - Allies: Defeated if damage ≥ Defense (no partial damage)  
  - Defender Allies: Must be killed before player or non-Defender Allies can be targeted  
- **Mission Tracks:**  
  - Advance using Mission (□) icons  
  - 12 points to reach top  
  - Mid-track and top rewards: one-time or permanent
