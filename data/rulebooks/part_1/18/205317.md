### 1. Lore & Objective
DOOM: The Board Game is a thematic tactical game based on the iconic video game series. Players take on the roles of either Space Marines fighting against demonic hordes or the Invader player controlling the demons. The core conflict centers on missions with asymmetric objectives: marines aim to complete specific goals (e.g., retrieving samples, escorting objectives), while the Invader seeks to stop them by accumulating frag tokens through eliminating marines.

The "Hurt Me Plenty" edition modifies core rules to rebalance the game in favor of the Invader, addressing perceived imbalances where marines had disproportionate advantages in smaller groups due to squad card bonuses. Additional solo and co-op variants allow for fully cooperative play using AI systems for demon control.

### 2. Components
- Marine figures and cards (including class cards)
- Demon figures and cards
- Portal tokens (blue, yellow, red)
- Threat cards and objective cards
- Event cards and event decks
- Glory Kill cards
- Initiative cards (marine and invader)
- Action cards (weapon sets, UAC Marine cards)
- Condition tokens (damage, stunned, fragged)
- Argent Power tokens
- Health kits, weapon tokens, grenades
- Teleporter tokens
- Objective tokens
- Dice (red, black)
- D6 and D8 dice for AI variants

### 3. Setup
**Base Setup:**
1. Assemble map tiles per mission guidelines.
2. Place portal stacks (e.g., Blue-Yellow-Red) and other tokens (health kits, weapons) as specified.
3. One player becomes the Invader; others control marines.
4. Each marine selects a figure, marine card, and two starting weapons (no duplicates). Form a 10-card action deck with UAC Marine cards and weapon sets.
5. The Invader chooses one of two drawn invasion cards and prepares corresponding demon cards face down. Creates an 18-card event deck from three chosen sets.
6. Shuffle Glory Kill deck and place in play area.
7. Marines deploy figures on or adjacent to active teleporters.

**Hurt Me Plenty Adjustments:**
- Do not use squad cards even with fewer than four marines.
- For 3 marines: designate a "Team Leader" who activates twice per round.
- For 2 marines: each activates twice per round.
- For 1 marine: activates four times per round.

**Solo/Co-op Setup:**
- No human Invader player.
- Use automated AI systems for demon movement and activation.
- Glory Kill and class cards are removed from marine use.
- Event deck used only for defense.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of two phases:

**Status Phase:**
1. **Spawn Demons:** Invader may summon from one faceup portal.
2. **Prepare Initiative Deck:** Include one marine initiative card per marine (plus extras based on player count) and one invader card per demon type present.
3. **Ready Demons:** Exhausted demon cards are readied.
4. **Draw Event Cards:** Invader draws up to six event cards.
5. **Gain Argent Power:** Discard up to three event cards to gain equivalent Argent Power tokens.

**Activation Phase:**
- Reveal initiative cards one at a time.
- **Marine Activation:** 
  - Respawn if fragged.
  - Ready class card if exhausted.
  - Perform one main action and any number of bonus actions.
  - Draw cards to refill hand to size (typically 3).
- **Demon Activation:** 
  - Exhaust a demon card and activate all demons of that type.
  - Move and attack using available movement points.
  - Use Argent Power abilities when applicable.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Movement:**
- 1 MP to move to adjacent space.
- +1 MP to enter difficult terrain or enemy-occupied space.
- +1 MP to open doors.
- Large figures ignore terrain effects.
- Flying demons ignore blocking/impassable terrain and difficult terrain for movement cost.

**Combat:**
1. Declare defender (within range and line of sight).
2. Roll attack dice (based on card).
3. Defender reveals defense card (from action deck for marines, event deck for demons).
4. Apply 'While Defending' and 'While Attacking' effects.
5. Calculate damage: damage icons minus shield icons. Dodge cancels all damage.
6. Tough demons add +1 defense automatically.

**Glory Kill:**
- Triggered when a marine moves into a space with a staggered demon.
- Demon is instantly fragged.
- Marine draws one Glory Kill card and recovers 2 damage.
- In "Hurt Me Plenty", Glory Kill cards are discarded when the marine is fragged.

**Summoning Demons:**
1. Choose a faceup portal.
2. Choose invasion group (blue/yellow/red) from invasion card.
3. Place demons in descending order, adjacent to portal.
4. Gain Argent Power as indicated.
5. **(Hurt Me Plenty)** Portal token remains faceup and can be reused unless closed by marines.

**Portal Tokens:**
- Three tiers (blue, yellow, red), each flipped per threat card rules.
- Marines can spend 1 MP during activation to close (discard) a faceup portal.
- Prevents further summoning from that portal unless reopened.

**Argent Power:**
- Spent to activate abilities marked with Argent Power icon.
- Gained by discarding event cards (up to 3 per Status Phase) or during summoning.
- Tokens placed on demon cards or invasion card, then distributed after summoning.

**Fragged:**
- Figure removed when damage ≥ health.
- Marines respawn at start of next activation on any active teleporter.
- Invader gains 1 frag token per marine fragged.
- Demons removed; if all of a type are fragged, flip card facedown.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Mission Objectives (Examples):**
- **Sample Collection:** Marines collect objective tokens; Invader gains frags (7/7/6/5 for 1/2/3/4 marines).
- **Asset Extraction:** Marines carry objective to teleporter; same frag threshold.
- **Guard Duty:** Marines gain progress tokens; Invader gains frag if demons control objectives.
- **Eliminate Hostiles:** Clear all demons and portals; Invader gains frag each round if not achieved.
- **Priority Escort:** Move objective to destination; Invader gains frag if marines fail.

**Victory Conditions:**
- Game ends immediately when either side achieves their objective.
- In solo/co-op modes, marines win by completing objective; lose if Invader reaches frag threshold (typically number of marines +1).

**Operation Victory:**
- First side to win 4 missions wins the operation.
- If tied after 7 missions, winner of final mission wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Glory Kill After Telefrag:** Telefragging a staggered demon counts as a Glory Kill.
- **Multiple Demons in Same Space:** Allowed; small figures cannot end movement in occupied space.
- **Large Figure Placement:** Must be as close as possible without displacing others if summoning site is blocked.
- **Line of Sight:** Draw line from any corner of attacker to any corner of defender; walls/doors block LOS.
- **Cover:** Determined by drawing lines from attacker’s corner to all defender’s corners; if any line crosses wall, terrain, or figure, defender has cover.
- **AI Demon Movement (Solo):** Use 8-sided die and movement chart unless specified (e.g., Pinkies move directly toward nearest marine).
- **Event Deck Depletion (AI):** When reshuffled, Invader gains 3 Argent Power tokens distributed by initiative priority.
- **Tie in Demon Activation Order (AI):** Resolve by base initiative or group size rules depending on variant.
