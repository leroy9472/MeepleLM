### 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn, perform in order:
#### PHASE A: Move Rancher
- Move your Rancher forward at least 1 step, up to your Step Limit.
- Skip empty spaces. Multiple Ranchers can occupy the same space.
- Pay fees when passing over Farmer Tiles or opponent's Buildings with hands (Black: $1, Green: $2 in 2/3p; $1 in 4p).
- Use a shortcut to Buenos Aires if your Engine has passed the corresponding Railroad space (3,6,9,12,17,23).
- If you reach Buenos Aires, end Phase A immediately.

#### PHASE B: Use Location Action
Actions depend on location:
- **Neutral or Your Building**: Use all Tile Actions (in any order) OR 1 single Auxiliary Action.
- **Opponent's Building**: Use 1 single Auxiliary Action.
- **Farmer Tile**: HELP THAT FARMER OR 1 single Auxiliary Action.
- **Buenos Aires**: Perform 6 subphases:
  1. **Extra Delivery**: Use a Disc from a Quay to deliver grain to a city quarter (pay grain cost, gain bonus).
  2. **Income**: Reveal hand. Sum breeding value of each *different* Cattle Card type. Add Permanent Certificates (from Station Master Tiles) and/or spend Temporary Certificates (move Certificate Marker back). Gain $ equal to total. Return Exhaustion Cards to deck, discard rest.
  3. **Loading**: Place 1 Disc from your board onto a Ship with value ≤ your Breeding Value. Pay grain cost (reduced by Permanent Grain). Pay $2 per missing grain. Gain Ship bonuses. Exception: Ships 0 and 18 can be used multiple times.
  4. **Foresight A**: Choose 1 of 2 Tiles in Foresight A, move to board.
  5. **Foresight B**: Choose 1 of 2 Tiles in Foresight B, move to board.
  6. **Foresight C**: Choose 1 of 2 Tiles in Foresight C, move to board.
     - After Foresight C, if you placed a Worker Tile:
       - If it filled the Job Market Token's space, move the Token down.
       - If Token passes yellow arrow → refill Cattle Market to initial count.
       - If Token passes blue arrow → let 3 Ships of matching color depart (move discs to Quays, replace with 2 new Ships).
       - If Token moves off bottom → trigger End Game.
     - Move Rancher to trail start.

#### PHASE C: Draw Cards
Draw up to your hand limit (4,5,6 based on cleared disc spaces).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Cattle Cards**: Used for discarding to gain rewards, determining breeding value in Buenos Aires, and providing strength for helping Farmers.
- **Worker Hiring**: Pay cost (modified by action) to place Worker Tile on leftmost free space of its row. Workers grant abilities (e.g., Machinists move Engine).
- **Help a Farmer**: On a Farmer Tile, use Strength to claim it. Strength = Strength icons on board (from Workers, disc spaces) + Strength from revealed Cattle Cards (1–2 cards: 1 Exhaustion; 3–4: 2 Exhaustion). If total ≥ Farmer's requirement, gain Tile, money, and choose to place it next to board (2 VP) or as Worker (pay cost, perform action).
- **Place a Building**: Pay $2 per required Carpenter to place a new Building or replace an existing one (pay difference in cost). Gain immediate action if covered.
- **Cattle Market**: Spend $ to buy Cattle Cards based on number of Gauchos. Each Gaucho can be used once per action. Unused Gauchos can add 2 cards to market.
- **Train Station Upgrade**: When Engine stops on a Turnout, pay cost to upgrade. Place 1 of your Discs (color rules apply). If Station Master Tile is present, replace it with a Worker from the rightmost space of its row to gain the Tile (immediate bonus + endgame VP).
- **Auxiliary Actions**: Become available by clearing disc spaces. Can be single or double (if both spaces cleared). Examples: Gain $, draw/disc cards, move Engine, move Certificate/Grain Marker.
- **Exchange Token**: Spend at any time to draw up to 2 cards, then discard same number.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End Game Trigger**: Job Market Token moves off the bottom of the board. The triggering player takes the Token. Each other player gets 1 final turn.

**Final Scoring**:
1. $5 → 1 VP
2. Placed Buildings → VP as printed
3. Discs on Ships → VP as printed (Ship 0: -2 VP)
4. Discs in Cities/Quays → VP as printed
5. Train Stations → VP as printed (last station counts per disc)
6. Farmer Tiles next to board → 2 VP each
7. Cattle Cards with VP → sum VP; Exhaustion Cards → -2 VP each
8. Objective Cards → fulfill all tasks: +VP; else: -VP. Each fulfilled task counts for only one card.
9. Station Master Tiles → VP based on condition (e.g., 3 VP per 2 Ships)
10. Workers on 5th/6th space → 4 VP each
11. Cleared disc space (right 1) → 2 VP
12. Job Market Token → 2 VP

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Cannot Pay Fees**: Pay what you can. No penalty.
- **No Discs to Place**: Remove 1 of your Discs from a Train Station of your choice.
- **Disc Color Mismatch**: Can place a dark-corner disc on a white-corner space, but not vice versa.
- **Engine Movement**: Ignore spaces occupied by other engines. Turnouts count as extra spaces.
- **Hand Limit**: Discard to 4 at start of first turn, then draw to limit each Phase C.
- **Empty Decks**: Shuffle discard pile to form new draw stack when needed.
