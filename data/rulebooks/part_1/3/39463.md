### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Cosmic Encounter*, each player assumes the role of a unique alien species vying for dominance in a chaotic galaxy. The primary objective is to establish colonies on foreign planets. The first player to control five foreign colonies wins. If multiple players reach this condition simultaneously, they share victory.

### 2. Components
- Player-specific components: 5 planets, 20 ships, 1 colony marker per player.
- Shared components: Warp (central board with colony track), Hyperspace Gate, Destiny Deck, Cosmic Deck (containing Encounter, Reinforcement, Artifact, and Flare cards), and optional decks (Reward, Hazard, Tech, Essence, Moon, Lux).
- Optional components: Alien sheets, Flare cards, Tech cards, Space Station markers, Moon tokens, Lux tokens, Special Ship markers, and various tokens (e.g., Grudge, Saboteur, Yin-Yang).

### 3. Setup
1. Each player chooses a color and takes matching planets, ships, and colony marker.
2. Place 4 ships on each of the 5 planets; place the warp in the center; set colony markers to "0".
3. Prepare the Destiny Deck: include one card per chosen player color plus Wild and Special cards; shuffle.
4. Choose Aliens: Shuffle Flare cards and deal two to each player. Each player selects one matching Alien sheet to keep, keeps the corresponding Flare, returns the other, and places their chosen Alien sheet facedown.
5. Add all Flares to the Cosmic Deck. If fewer than 5 players, add random Flares to total 10. Shuffle the Cosmic Deck.
6. Deal 8 Cosmic cards to each player.
7. Reveal Destiny cards until a player’s color is drawn; that player is first. Shuffle the deck.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
A player’s turn consists of 1–2 encounters. A second encounter is allowed only if the first is won or a deal is successfully made.

**Phases of an Encounter:**
0. **Start Turn (First Encounter Only):**  
   - If the offense has no Encounter cards, discard hand and draw 8. Repeat until at least one Encounter card is obtained.  
   - If the offense runs out of Encounter cards later, the turn ends immediately.

1. **Regroup:**  
   - Offense retrieves 1 ship from the warp and places it on any colony.  
   - If no colonies exist, place the ship directly on the Hyperspace Gate.

2. **Destiny:**  
   - Offense draws the top card of the Destiny Deck.  
   - **Color Card:** Encounter occurs in that player’s system.  
   - **Own Color:** Offense may attempt to remove a foreign colony from their home system or re-establish a lost home colony (if planet is empty).  
   - **Wild:** Offense chooses any player for the encounter.  
   - **Special:** Encounter details are specified.  
   - If only one card remains in the deck, shuffle discard pile into it before drawing.

3. **Launch:**  
   - Offense points the Hyperspace Gate at a planet in the target system.  
   - Commits 1–4 ships from any colonies to the gate.

4. **Alliance:**  
   - Offense invites allies (cannot invite defense).  
   - Defense invites allies (cannot invite offense).  
   - Starting left of offense and proceeding clockwise, players accept or decline invitations.  
   - Allies commit 1–4 ships: offensive allies to the gate, defensive allies beside the target planet.

5. **Planning:**  
   - Offense and defense simultaneously select an Encounter card (Attack, Negotiate, Morph) and place it facedown.  
   - If defense has no Encounter cards, discard hand and draw 8; repeat until at least one Encounter card is obtained.  
   - If offense has no Encounter cards, turn ends immediately.

6. **Reveal:**  
   - Both main players reveal their Encounter cards.  
   - Resolve card interactions:
     - **Attack vs. Attack:** Higher total (card + ships) wins. Ties favor defense.
     - **Attack vs. Negotiate:** Attack wins, but negotiator collects Compensation.
     - **Negotiate vs. Negotiate:** Allies return ships. Main players have 1 minute to make a deal (must involve card or colony exchange). Failure results in both sending 3 ships to warp.
     - **Morph:** Becomes a copy of opponent’s card. If both play Morph, both lose; all ships go to warp.
   - Reinforcement cards may be played after reveal, in response, until all pass.

7. **Resolution:**  
   - **Offense Wins:** Offense and offensive allies place ships on the planet. Defense and defensive allies’ ships go to warp (bystanders unaffected). Each new foreign colony advances the colony marker.
   - **Defense Wins:** Offensive ships go to warp. Defensive allies gain rewards: for each ship committed, draw 1 card or retrieve 1 ship from warp.
   - **Successful Deal:** Deal terms executed. Ships on gate return to offense.
   - **Unsuccessful Deal:** Main players each send 3 ships to warp.
   - **Compensation:** When a player loses by playing Negotiate against Attack, they take 1 random card per ship lost from the winner’s hand (up to entire hand).

After resolution:
- Discard all revealed Encounter cards.
- If offense won or made a deal and it was the first encounter, and they have Encounter cards, they may take a second encounter (starting at Regroup).
- Otherwise, turn ends; play passes clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Encounter Cards:** Attack (numerical value), Negotiate (deal attempt), Morph (copies opponent’s card).
- **Reinforcement Cards:** Played after Reveal, add to totals.
- **Flare Cards:** Powerful one-time effects; return to hand after use. Only one Flare per encounter. If played by matching alien, use "Super" effect; otherwise, "Wild" effect.
- **Artifact Cards:** One-time effects; discarded after use.
- **Alien Powers:** Unique abilities tied to Alien sheets. Mandatory or optional, used in specified phases.
- **Losing Alien Powers:** If a player controls fewer than 3 home colonies, flip Alien sheet facedown. Regain when 3+ home colonies exist.
- **Zapping Powers:** "Cosmic Zap" Artifact cancels a power’s use if it requires "use"; cannot zap passive effects.
- **Timing Conflicts:** Resolve in order: Offense → Defense → Others (clockwise from offense).
- **Cosmic Quake:** If Cosmic and discard piles are empty and a draw is needed, all players discard hands, shuffle discard pile into new deck, and draw 8 cards.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Victory is achieved by having 5 foreign colonies.
- The colony track on the warp tracks each player’s foreign colonies.
- Game ends immediately when any player reaches 5 foreign colonies. If multiple do so simultaneously, they win together.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Empty Home Planet:** Defense still owns the planet; defends with 0 ships.
- **Bystanders:** Colonies on the target planet not involved in the encounter; unaffected by outcome.
- **No Colonies:** If a player has no colonies, retrieved ship from Regroup is placed on the Hyperspace Gate.
- **Compensation:** Only main player receives it; based on their ships lost, not allies’.
- **Reinforcements:** Played after Reveal; order: offense → defense → clockwise.
- **Morph vs. Morph:** Both lose; all ships go to warp.
- **Drawing Cards:** If defense has no Encounter cards, they may play phase-legal non-Encounter cards, then discard and draw 8.
