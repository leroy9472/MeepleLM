## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Santorini is a strategy board game where players take on the roles of Greek gods, each with unique powers, to outmaneuver their opponents. The primary objective is to be the first to move one of your Workers onto a level 3 space by moving up during your turn. Additional win conditions may be introduced by certain God Powers. In the solo variant Santowerini, the player defends the city from enemy invaders by constructing buildings and defeating enemies.

### 2. Components
- Game board (5×5 grid)
- 10 building blocks (2 of each color: white, black, blue, red, yellow)
- 4 domes
- 2 player pawns (Workers) per player
- God Power cards (Simple and Advanced)
- Promo cards (e.g., Tyche, Proteus, Scylla, Eris, Castor & Pollux, Maenads, Asteria, Iris, Hippolyta, Nyx, Hydra, Pegasus)
- 6-sided die (for solo mode)
- Additional tokens for special powers (e.g., Whirlpool Tokens, Coin Tokens)

### 3. Setup
- **Challenger Role**: The Challenger selects God Power cards equal to the number of players. All God Powers must be compatible with the player count.
- **God Selection**: Starting clockwise from the player to the left of the Challenger, each player selects a God Power. The Challenger picks last.
- **Starting Player**: The Challenger chooses the starting player.
- **Worker Placement**: Players place their two Workers on unoccupied spaces on the board, clockwise from the starting player.
- **Special Setup**: Some God Powers require additional setup (e.g., Bia places Workers first; Eros places Workers on opposite edges; Proteus places three Workers).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- **Turn Order**: Players take turns in clockwise order.
- **Turn Structure**: On your turn, select one of your Workers and perform the following:
  1. **Move**: Move your selected Worker to one of the eight neighboring spaces. You may move up one level or down any number of levels. The destination space must be unoccupied (no Worker or dome).
  2. **Build**: Build a block or dome on an unoccupied space neighboring the moved Worker. You can build on any level, but must choose the appropriate block or dome for the level being built.
- **God Powers**: Use your God Power according to its timing and effect. Some powers modify movement, building, or provide additional actions.
- **Forced Moves**: Some powers force opponent Workers into different spaces. A forced Worker is not considered to have moved.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Movement**: Move to a neighboring space, up one level or down any number of levels. Cannot move into an occupied space.
- **Building**: Build a block or dome on a neighboring unoccupied space. Domes cap a tower at level 3.
- **Win Conditions**:
  - Move one of your Workers up onto a level 3 block during your turn.
  - Some God Powers provide alternative win conditions (e.g., Chronus wins with five Complete Towers; Maenads win if their Workers neighbor an opponent's Worker on opposite sides).
- **Lose Conditions**:
  - Unable to perform a move and build on your turn.
  - In solo mode, losing occurs if all buildings are destroyed, an enemy reaches a target zone, all builders are defeated, or unable to perform move-then-build.
- **God Power Interactions**:
  - "Forced" is not "Moved": A Worker forced into a space is not considered to have moved.
  - Domes are not Blocks: Powers affecting blocks do not affect domes.
  - "Cannot" or "Must" rules must be obeyed, or you lose.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Winning**: Instantly win if one of your Workers moves up onto a level 3 block during your turn. Some God Powers add additional win conditions.
- **Losing**: Lose if you cannot perform a move and build on your turn.
- **Solo Mode Scoring**:
  - Score points equal to the scenario level.
  - Bonuses: +2 for "First!", +2 for "Stayin' alive", +2 for "Buildings, buildings everywhere".
  - Campaign bonus: +2 for Expert, -2 for Easy.
  - Ranks: Novice (0-9), Apprentice (10-19), Assistant (20-29), Journeyman (30-39), Master (40-49), Guild Master (50+).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Forced Moves**: A Worker forced into a space is not considered to have moved.
- **Winning via Force**: Being forced onto level 3 does not count as a win.
- **Multiple Moves**: Additional moves (e.g., Artemis, Triton) are separate moves, not a single long move.
- **God Power Conflicts**: Apply your own powers first, then opponent's.
- **Solo Mode**: Enemies attack and move based on die rolls and orientation toward buildings. Players can defeat enemies by building on adjacent lower-level spaces.
