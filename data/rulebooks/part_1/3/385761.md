## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Beyond the Sea of Mists lies Alula, a mysterious continent where balance shapes ever-changing landscapes. Players explore its biomes, encounter denizens, discover wonders (Uddu, Okiko, Goldlog), and complete quests to earn fame. The goal in the base game is to have the highest fame after 8 rounds. In the solo mode, the objective is to beat your own high score.

2. Components  
- 68 Region cards  
- 45 Sanctuary cards  
- 1 Score pad  

Each Region card features:  
- Exploration duration (1–68 hours, unique per card)  
- Biome type (River/Spring, Mushroom Forest/Fall, Cave City/Summer, Rocky Desert/Winter, or Mystical Haven)  
- Clues (bonus icons for Sanctuary access)  
- Wonders: Uddu (mineral), Okiko (animal), Goldlog (plant)  
- Denizens with quests (may include prerequisites)  

Sanctuary cards may include:  
- Night Exploration icon (no duration)  
- Clues  
- Wonders (Uddu, Okiko, Goldlog)  
- Colored frieze (biome type)  
- Side quests for additional fame  

3. Setup  
For solo play using the "Beat your own high score" variant:  
- Set up as a four-player game.  
- Shuffle the 68 Region cards and deal 3 to the player (or 5 if using the advanced variant).  
- Reveal 5 Region cards face up in the center (market).  
- Shuffle Sanctuary cards into a separate face-down deck and place beside the Region deck.  
- Opponents do not have hands or tableaus.  

Advanced Variant (optional):  
- Deal 5 Region cards, choose 3 to keep, return 2 to the deck, then shuffle and reveal 5 for the market.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 8 rounds. Each round consists of three phases:

1. **Exploring a Region**  
   - Player selects one card from hand and places it face down.  
   - Reveal it and place it to the right of the previous card in their tableau.  
   - If this card’s exploration duration is higher than the previous one (or if it’s the first card), the player gains access to Sanctuary cards.  
     - Receive 1 Sanctuary card + 1 additional for each Clue icon in their tableau (from both Region and Sanctuary cards).  
     - Choose one Sanctuary to keep; return the rest to the bottom of the Sanctuary deck.  
     - Note: No Sanctuary is earned on Round 1 (no prior card).  

2. **Opponent Simulation (Solo Mode Only)**  
   - Draw 5 new Region cards and place them in a line from right to left (selection row).  
   - Player plays their next card face up beneath this row.  
   - Draw 3 cards from the Region deck—these represent opponents’ exploration cards.  
   - Arrange the 3 opponent cards face up above the selection row in ascending order of exploration duration.  
   - Determine turn order: lowest exploration duration goes first.  
   - For each opponent card with a lower duration than the player’s:  
     - Use the following table to determine which of the 5 selection cards they pick:  

       | Duration Range | Selected Card (from left to right) |
       |----------------|------------------------------------|
       | 1–13           | Card 1                             |
       | 14–26          | Card 2                             |
       | 27–40          | Card 3                             |
       | 41–53          | Card 4                             |
       | 54–68          | Card 5                             |

     - If the intended card is already taken, select the next available card to the right.  
     - If no cards remain to the right, wrap around to the leftmost card and continue.  
     - Place the opponent’s card on top of the selected Region card to mark it as taken.  
   - Opponents playing after the player have no effect; discard their cards and any unselected Region cards.  

3. **Drafting & Refreshing Market**  
   - After resolving all earlier players (including simulated opponents), the player selects one card from the remaining available cards in the selection row.  
   - Add it to their hand (unless it's the 8th round).  
   - Discard the remaining unselected Region cards (including any not chosen by opponents or player).  
   - Replenish the market: reveal 5 new Region cards for the next round.  
   - Repeat for 8 rounds.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Exploration Duration**: Determines turn order each round. Lower = earlier action.  
- **Sanctuary Access**: Triggered only when current Region card has a higher duration than the previous one.  
- **Clues**: Each Clue (on any face-up card) grants +1 Sanctuary draw when accessing Sanctuaries.  
- **Quests & Prerequisites**: Some denizens require visible Wonders (Uddu, Okiko, Goldlog) on Region or Sanctuary cards to score fame.  
- **Biomes**: Represented by frieze patterns. Used in scoring sets and specific quests.  
- **Solo Opponent Behavior**: Simulated via 3 drawn cards; their choices are determined by duration-based lookup and left-to-right availability.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After playing 8 Region cards, proceed to scoring.  
- Flip all Region cards face down; keep Sanctuary cards face up.  
- Reveal Region cards one by one from right to left (last played first).  
- For each card, score fame based on all currently revealed Region cards and all Sanctuary cards.  

Scoring Types:  
- 1 Fame per visible Clue icon  
- 2 Fame per visible Uddu (mineral)  
- 4 Fame per visible Okiko (animal)  
- 3 Fame per visible Goldlog (plant)  
- 2 Fame per visible Mushroom Forest (Fall) AND River (Spring) biome  
- 4 Fame per visible Cave City (Summer) biome  
- 10 Fame per complete set of 4 different biomes  
- 4 Fame per visible Nighttime Exploration  
- Additional fame from Sanctuary side quests  

Important: Some quests require prerequisites (e.g., specific Wonders) to score their Fame value. These must be met at the time of scoring.  
- After scoring all Region cards, total fame from Sanctuary side quests.  
- Sum all fame. Highest total wins.  
- Tiebreaker: Player with the lowest exploration duration among all 8 cards in their tableau wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use the same Wonder for multiple quests?**  
  Yes. Wonders can satisfy multiple quest prerequisites.  

- **Do Sanctuaries count toward biome counts and prerequisites?**  
  Yes. Sanctuaries with a colored frieze count as that biome type.  

- **What happens if all 5 selection cards are taken before my turn?**  
  This cannot happen. Only 3 opponents act before you (in solo mode), so at least 2 cards remain available.  

- **Can I play a Sanctuary card on the 8th round?**  
  Yes, if you earned Sanctuary access during the 8th round, you may choose and play one Sanctuary card during the draft phase, even though you do not draw a new Region card.  

- **Are Clues cumulative across rounds?**  
  Yes. All Clue icons on face-up Region and Sanctuary cards count when determining number of Sanctuary draws.  

- **Do opponent cards affect anything besides card selection?**  
  No. Opponent cards only determine which Region cards are removed from the selection row. They do not score, collect, or interact beyond that.
