### 1. Lore & Objective
The goal of Cyclades is to be the first player to control two Metropolises at the end of a cycle (three in a two-player game), or to collect all five Divine Artifacts for an immediate victory. In team play (4 or 6 players), the first team to control three Metropolises wins.

### 2. Components
- Game board (islands or continents variant)
- Player colors: Troops, Fleets, Territory Markers, Offering Markers
- Building tiles: Port, Fortress, Temple, University, Theater, Metropolis, Necropolis
- Mythological Creature cards and figurines (e.g., Minotaur, Kraken, Pegasus)
- Hero cards and figurines (e.g., Achilles, Ulysses)
- Divine Artifact cards and figurines (e.g., Zeus’ Lightning, Winged Sandals)
- Magic Items cards
- Divine Favors tiles
- Priest, Philosopher, and Priestess cards
- Gold Pieces (GP)
- Hades Threat tile and column
- Combat dice

### 3. Setup
- Choose board (islands or continents). For continents, randomly place one of each building (Port, Fortress, Temple, University) on designated spaces.
- Each player takes 5 GP (7 GP in Titans expansion), units (8 Fleets, 8 Troops), and screen.
- Shuffle Mythological Creature deck (including Heroes and Artifacts) and place face-down. Reveal three face-up on the track (costs: 4, 3, 2 GP).
- Shuffle 4 (or 5 with Titans) God tiles and place face-up above Apollo. Number of visible Gods = players – 1; others are set aside for future cycles.
- Shuffle Divine Favors and Magic Items decks; place face-down.
- Randomly draw and reveal 2 Special Metropolis cards.
- Randomly draw and reveal Monument cards equal to player count.
- Determine starting order by shuffling offering markers and placing on turn track.
- In Titans expansion: players bid in a preliminary round to choose starting territories, receiving bonuses based on the God they win (e.g., Poseidon: 1 Fleet + 1 Port).
- First cycle skips Revenue phase.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each cycle proceeds in this order:
1. **Hades Roll**: First player rolls 2 dice; advance Hades column. If ≥9, Hades replaces the last visible God; reshuffle Divine Favors.
2. **Refresh Creatures**: Discard 2 GP creature if unused; shift others right; refill from deck.
3. **Refresh Gods**: Shuffle and place Gods (number = players – 1). If Hades was active, return to stack and reshuffle.
4. **Divine Favor**: Place a tile next to the last visible God before Apollo (if Hades inactive).
5. **Revenue Phase**: Gain 1 GP per controlled Prosperity Marker (cornucopias or placed markers). Necropolis owner collects all stored GP.
6. **Hero Maintenance**: Pay 2 GP per hero or discard a Priestess to retain each.
7. **Offerings Phase**: Players bid in turn order for Gods. Apollo is free and allows multiple bidders. If outbid, immediately rebid elsewhere. Bids resolve simultaneously; payment reduced by 1 GP per Priest (min 1 GP).
8. **Actions Phase**: In God order:
   - Perform free recruit (e.g., Ares: 1 free Troop).
   - Perform actions in any order: Recruit, Build, Special Action, Buy Creature/Hero/Artifact, Use Divine Favor, Sacrifice Hero, Move Titans.
   - Pay costs as actions are taken.
   - Place turn marker on lowest available turn track space.
9. **Combat**: Triggered when units enter enemy-occupied space. Resolve immediately.
10. **End of Cycle**: If Hades was active, remove all Undead units and reset Hades to 0. Check victory.

- **Zeus**: Recruit Priest (0,4 GP), Build Temple (2 GP), Replace a Creature card (1 GP).
- **Athena**: Recruit Philosopher (0,4 GP), Build University (2 GP).
- **Kronos**: Recruit Titan (2 GP), or Build a free building from Gods above him; if top God, get free Titan.
- **Hades**: Recruit 1–5 Undead units (0,1,2,3,4 GP), Build Necropolis (2 GP), Move units if at least one Undead is present.

- Removed if upkeep unpaid or killed in battle.

#### Divine Favors

- **Sea Battle**: Defender gets +1 per adjacent Port.
- Lowest total loses 1 unit; ties: both lose 1.

- Repeat until one side eliminated or retreats.

#### Movement
- Fleets move via Special Actions (Poseidon, Sylph) or Creature powers.
- Troops move via Ares (fleet chain), Titans, or Pegasus.
- Units cannot pass through enemy-occupied land without combat (except with Cap of Invisibility).

### 6. Scoring & End Game

- **No Attack on Last Island**: Forbidden unless it would immediately grant victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Creature Discard**: Figurine creatures are discarded at start of owner’s next action; non-figurine are discarded after use.
- **Chimera**: When discarded, shuffle discard pile into draw pile.
- **Monuments**: Require two specific buildings; remain when Metropolis is built.
- **Egyptian Reinforcements**: Not Creatures; special attack costs 1 GP; abilities only trigger on special attack.
