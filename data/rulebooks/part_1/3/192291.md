## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
You are dining at a deluxe sushi feast where you curate your own menu from a variety of sushi dishes represented by cards. The goal is to score the most points over three rounds by collecting and combining cards strategically. Points are earned through card-specific scoring rules, and the player with the highest total at the end of the third round wins.

2. **Components**  
- 181 Cards (including Nigiri, Maki Rolls, Dumplings, etc.)  
- 22 Menu Tiles (showing available card types in play)  
- 8 Player Pawns (colored)  
- 1 Game Board (with score track)  

3. **Setup**  
- Place the game board in the center.  
- Each player selects a color and places their pawn on the "0" space of the score track.  
- Choose a menu from the options (e.g., My First Meal, Sushi Go!, Create Your Own Menu).

  - Nigiri cards are always used.  
  - 1 type of rolls.  
  - 3 types of appetizers.  
  - 2 types of specials.

  - All players simultaneously choose 1 card from their hand and place it face-down.  
  - All reveal their chosen cards.  
  - Pass remaining hand to the player on the left.  
  - Pick up the new hand and repeat.
