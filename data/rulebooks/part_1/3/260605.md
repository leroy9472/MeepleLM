## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Camels race around a track while players bet on outcomes. The game ends when any camel crosses the finish line. The player with the most Egyptian Pounds (EP) wins.

2. Components  
- 1 game board with track and finish line  
- 5 colored racing camels (green, yellow, red, blue, purple)  
- 2 crazy camels (black, white)  
- 5 colored dice (matching racing camels)  
- 1 gray die (for crazy camels)  
- 20 betting tickets (4 per color: values $5, $3, $2, $2)  
- 5 pyramid tickets (worth 1 EP each)  
- 80 Egyptian Pound (EP) coins (50×1, 30×5)  
- 40 finish cards (5 per player character)  
- 8 spectator tiles (1 per character) with cheering/booing sides  
- 8 partnership cards (1 per character, used only with 6+ players)  
- 1 starting player marker  

3. Setup  
- Place board in center; organize EP supply (bank).  
- Sort betting tickets by color, stack per color: bottom to top → $2, $2, $3, $5. Place on matching ticket tents.  
- Place pyramid tickets as a stack on their board space.  
- Give each player:  
  - 3 EP  
  - 5 finish cards (same character)  
  - 1 spectator tile (same character)  
- For 6+ players only: give each a partnership card, placed “available” side up.  
- Determine camel starting positions:  
  - Roll 5 colored dice: place each racing camel on space 1, 2, or 3 per die result. Stack camels on same space (order arbitrary). All face clockwise.  
  - Roll gray die twice: place black and white crazy camels on spaces 16 (1), 15 (2), or 14 (3). If same space, stack (order arbitrary). Face counterclockwise.  
- Place all 6 dice into the pyramid; cap it and place on board.  
- Give starting player marker to youngest player.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:  
  1. **Move Camels**  
     - Take 1 pyramid ticket (worth 1 EP at leg end).  
     - Shake pyramid, reveal 1 die:  
       - Colored die: move matching camel 1–3 spaces clockwise.  
       - Gray die: determine which crazy camel to move (see Core Mechanics).  
     - Move the camel unit (camel + any on top). If landing on another camel unit, stack on top.  
     - Place revealed die on a free dice tent.  
  2. **Claim 1 Betting Ticket**  
     - Take top ticket from any color stack.  
     - No cost. You may hold multiple tickets of same/different colors.  
  3. **Place or Move Your Spectator Tile**  
     - Place on any empty space (not space 1, not adjacent to another spectator tile).  
     - If already on board, may move it (same placement rules).  
     - Choose cheering (forward) or booing (backward) side up.  
     - When any camel lands on it: gain 1 EP from bank.  
     - Tile remains until end of leg or moved.  
  4. **Bet on Overall Winner or Loser**  
     - Choose one of your finish cards.  
     - Place it face down on either:  
       - “Overall Winner” pile  
       - “Overall Loser” pile  
     - Cards stay permanently; you may place multiple over game.  
  5. **Enter Betting Partnership (6+ players only)**  
     - Available only once per leg per player.  
     - Choose another player with “available” partnership card.  
     - Exchange cards (cannot be refused); flip both to “partnership” side.  
     - At leg end, both partners may copy **one** ticket award (betting or pyramid) from each other.  
     - Reset to “available” after leg scoring.  
- A leg ends when **5 of 6 dice** have been revealed (one die remains in pyramid).  
- Then, conduct **Leg Scoring** (see Scoring & End Game).  
- Reset components; next leg begins with new starting player.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Camel Stacking**:  
  - Camels on same space form a stack. Top camel is in lead.  
  - When a camel moves, it carries all camels above it.  
  - If a camel unit lands on another, it jumps on top.  
- **Crazy Camels (Black/White)**:  
  - Move counterclockwise when gray die is revealed.  
  - Carry any camels on their back backward.  
  - **Exceptions for movement**:  
    - If only one crazy camel carries racing camels, move that one (regardless of die color).  
    - If one crazy camel is directly on top of the other, move the top one.  
  - Crazy camels are **ignored** in rankings (never first/last).  
- **Spectator Tile Effects**:  
  - When a camel unit lands on it:  
    - **Cheering side**: move camel unit 1 space forward (stack on top if occupied).  
    - **Booing side**: move camel unit 1 space backward (placed **underneath** if occupied).  
  - Effect applies immediately; owner gains 1 EP.  
- **Movement Direction**:  
  - Racing camels always face clockwise.  
  - Crazy camels always face counterclockwise.  
  - Orientation remains even during backward movement.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End of a Leg (after 5 dice revealed)**:  
  1. **Starting Player**: Pass marker to player left of the one who took the last pyramid ticket.  
  2. **Rank Racing Camels**:  
     - Ignore crazy camels.  
     - Farthest clockwise space = lead. Top camel in stack is first.  
  3. **Settle Bets**:  
     - For each **betting ticket** on:  
       - **Winning camel**: gain printed value ($5, $3, or $2)  
       - **Second place**: gain 1 EP  
       - **3rd–5th place**: lose 1 EP  
     - For each **pyramid ticket**: gain 1 EP  
  4. **Clean Up**:  
     - Return all betting tickets to stacks (bottom to top: $2, $2, $3, $5)  
     - Return pyramid tickets to board stack  
     - Return spectator tiles to players  
     - Return 5 revealed dice to pyramid  
- **End of Game**:  
  - Triggered when **any camel unit crosses the finish line** (space beyond space 16).  
  - Immediately end current leg and perform **one final leg scoring**.  
  - Then perform **Game-End Scoring**:  
    1. **Overall Winner Bets**:  
       - Reveal “Overall Winner” pile from bottom to top (oldest to newest).  
       - For cards matching the **winning camel**:  
         - 1st correct card: 8 EP  
         - 2nd: 5 EP  
         - 3rd: 3 EP  
         - 4th: 2 EP  
         - 5th and beyond: 1 EP  
       - For incorrect cards: lose 1 EP each  
    2. **Overall Loser Bets**:  
       - Reveal “Overall Loser” pile same way.  
       - For cards matching the **last racing camel** (bottom of stack if tied):  
         - Same payout: 8, 5, 3, 2, 1+ EP  
       - Incorrect cards: lose 1 EP each  
     - **Note**: Crazy camels ignored. If a crazy camel carries racing camels across finish line backward, those camels count as last.  
  - All players count EP. Highest total wins. Tie = shared victory.  
  - No player can go below 0 EP.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I claim multiple betting tickets per turn?**  
  No. One per turn, but you may claim one each turn during a leg.  
- **Can I move my spectator tile multiple times?**  
  Yes, each time using the “Place or Move” action.  
- **What if no space is available for spectator tile?**  
  You may still use other actions. Wait until space opens.  
- **What happens if the last die in pyramid is never revealed?**  
  Leg ends after 5 dice are revealed. The 6th die stays unrevealed and is returned during reset.  
- **Can I bet on both overall winner and loser?**  
  Yes. You may place finish cards on both piles over the game.  
- **Do pyramid tickets expire?**  
  No. Collected each leg and paid at leg end. Reset after.  
- **Can a spectator tile be on the same space as a camel?**  
  No. Must be placed on empty space (no camels or tiles).  
- **What if a camel is moved backward onto space 1?**  
  Legal. Space 1 can be occupied, but spectator tiles cannot be placed there.
