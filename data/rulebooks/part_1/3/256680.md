### 1. Lore & Objective
The Curse deck represents the dark influence of the sorcerer Azkol, who seeks to protect his Dark Tower from Heroes. The Curse cards introduce additional rules and challenges that hinder the Heroes' progress. While the base game’s objective remains unchanged—complete the Main Goal and defeat the Adversary—the Curse deck modifies gameplay to increase difficulty. Success with Curse cards results in a "limited victory," with the number of Skulls collected indicating how incomplete the triumph is.

### 2. Components
- Curse deck: A set of cards divided into parts by letter codes:
  - **S**: Setup
  - **G**: Game
  - **B**: Battle with ordinary Foes
  - **D**: Dungeons
  - **BA**: Battle with the Adversary
  - **SA**: Setup with Alliances (added if Alliances expansion is used)
  - **GA**: Game with Alliances (added if Alliances expansion is used)
- Skull tokens (used as penalty markers on Curse cards)

### 3. Setup
1. Divide the Curse deck into parts by letter code (S, G, B, D, BA, and if applicable, SA, GA).
2. Shuffle each part separately.
3. Optionally, split the **G** part into two sub-decks.
4. Place the shuffled parts in random order on the table.
5. Draw cards one at a time from the top of each part until reaching the required **Curse Points** total:
   - Base game: **10 Curse Points**
   - With Alliances expansion: **13 Curse Points** (10 + 3)
   - Later games may increase difficulty to 15 or 20 Curse Points.
6. Place selected Curse cards face up next to the game board.
7. If using Alliances expansion, include at least two cards from **SA** and **GA** parts.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Curse card effects are active and **override standard rules**.
- Players proceed with normal gameplay via monthly turns, events, and actions.
- At the end of each turn, a Skull must be dropped into the Tower.
- Events may trigger based on app prompts.
- Curse cards may impose restrictions on actions, resources, combat, and progression.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Curse Points
- Each Curse card has a Curse Point value in the bottom-left corner.
- Total Curse Points determine difficulty.
- Exceeding the target by 1–2 points indicates a stronger challenge.

#### Violating Curse Card Rules
If a player breaks a condition on a Curse card:
1. Acknowledge the violation.
2. Take a Skull from the supply and place it on the violated card.
   - If no Skulls remain in supply, the game may end.
- Victory with Skulls on Curse cards is "incomplete"—the number of Skulls indicates the degree of limitation.

#### Modes
- **Random and Anarchy Mode**: Shuffle all Curse deck parts together and draw cards until target Curse Points are met.

#### Specific Curse Effects (Examples)
- **Resource Limits**: 
  - Max 20 Warriors (30 from Month 5), max 7 Spirits (10 from Month 4), max 12 Influence (20 from Month 5).
- **Corruption Rules**:
  - Players start with 1 Corruption.
  - Max 3 Corruptions allowed.
  - First Corruption is permanent and cannot be removed.
- **Guild Restrictions**:
  - No Guild boards or Companions (except meeting place).
  - Guilds start at Rank 0; require 5 Influence to upgrade to Rank 1.
  - Max Guild Rank is 3.
  - Cannot upgrade Guild if its Kingdom has 2+ Skulls on buildings.
- **Combat Rules**:
  - Cannot use Advantages exceeding Foe level.
  - After defeating Foes, roll Haggle die; “Evil Merchant” result causes Corruption unless 1 Spirit is paid to reroll.
  - After battle, rotate used Gear/Treasures 90°; they are disabled until restored via Haggle die roll.
- **Dungeon Rules**:
  - Cannot exit until target room is found.
  - After every second Advantage used, take a Skull; 4 Skulls cause Corruption.
  - First two rooms cannot reduce difficulty.
- **Adversary Rules**:
  - Cannot reduce Adversary cards to minimum level.
  - After reducing two Adversary cards in a row to minimum, gain a Corruption.
  - Discard one Companion when entering Adversary battle.
  - Must fulfill Adversary card requirements before lowering level.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Condition**: Complete the Main Goal and defeat the Adversary.
- **Victory Quality**: Determined by Skulls on Curse cards:
  - Each Skull = a mark of incomplete victory.
  - Fewer Skulls = purer triumph.
- **Loss Conditions**:
  - Any Hero gains a third Corruption.
  - Sixth month ends.
  - No Skulls available in supply when required.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Skull Supply Depletion**: If violating a Curse card requires a Skull but none are available, the game ends immediately.
- **Multiple Rule Conflicts**: Curse card text takes precedence over all other rules.
- **Alliances Expansion Interaction**: When using Alliances, include at least one card from SA and one from GA.
- **Haggle Die in Reinforce**: Can be rolled before Reinforce even if Reinforce is restricted by Curse cards (unless explicitly forbidden).
- **Item Reuse**: Rotated (disabled) items can be restored by rolling a positive result on the Haggle die during a turn.
