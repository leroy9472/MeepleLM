## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Welcome to *Crime City*, a quiet city overrun with crime. As detectives, your objective is to solve criminal cases by examining a detailed city map and using a deck of case cards. Each case presents a mystery that unfolds through sequential tasks. Players must work cooperatively to observe, deduce, and locate specific scenes on the map that answer each task. The ultimate goal is to solve all tasks in a case correctly and uncover the full story behind each crime.

### 2. Components  
- 1 City map (large, detailed illustration of Crime City)  
- 120 Case cards (divided into multiple cases, each marked with a case icon and card number)  
- 16 Envelopes (one for each case, used to store case cards)  
- 1 Magnifying glass (+ sticker to apply)  

### 3. Setup  
- Apply the sticker to the magnifying glass.  
- Sort the case cards by case, placing each deck into its corresponding envelope in numerical order. Avoid looking at card backs.  
- Unfold the city map on a large table or hang it on a wall. Ensure:  
  - All players can view the map clearly from all sides.  
  - The area is well-lit (daylight or bright lamp) to see small details.  
  - The map remains unobstructed (no drinks or cards on top).  
- Place the case decks beside the map, not on it.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Assign a Lead Investigator** – This player reads card texts aloud and manages the deck.  
2. **Begin a Case** – Take a case deck (e.g., "The Top Hat") and place it next to the map.  
3. **Reveal Start Card** – The Lead Investigator shows the front (image of the main character) and reads the back (crime overview) aloud.  
4. **Solve Tasks Sequentially** –  
   - The next card’s front describes a task (black background). Read it aloud.  
   - Players search the city map to find the matching scene.  
   - Once a solution is proposed, the Lead Investigator checks the card’s back:  
     - If correct: read the text and show the image; set the card aside.  
     - If incorrect: do **not** read the text; return the card to the top of the deck; continue investigating.  
   - The Lead Investigator may give hints if the group is stuck but must not actively solve.  
5. **Progress Through the Deck** – Repeat until all tasks in the case are solved.  
6. **Use the Magnifying Glass** – For close inspection of map details.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Observation**: Success depends on noticing small visual details on the city map.  
- **Cooperation**: All players contribute to solving tasks; avoid dominance by one player.  
- **Clue Symbol (★)**: Indicates information useful for later tasks in the same case.  
- **Multiple Tasks**: If a card says *“(Move this card next to the deck so that the question below can also be seen!)”*, it allows working on multiple questions simultaneously. Up to four questions may be open at once.  
- **No Guessing**: Solutions must be visually confirmed on the map.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is no numerical scoring system.  
- A case is **solved** when all tasks are correctly answered in sequence.  
- The game ends when the group completes a case or chooses to stop.  
- After solving all cases, players can explore hidden puzzles on the map (e.g., “Why was a man pushed into the water?”). Answers available at www.micromacro-game.com.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What if we can’t find the solution?**  
  Re-examine the map, use the magnifying glass, and consider earlier clues. If stuck, consider the advanced version rules to reveal solved questions for hints.  
- **Can the Lead Investigator help?**  
  Only by giving subtle hints if the group is off track. They must not solve the task.  
- **What if we see the answer accidentally?**  
  Try to avoid pre-revealing card backs. Use security inserts (optional) to block views of final card backs in envelopes.  
- **Can we play cases out of order?**  
  Yes, but beginners should follow the recommended order:  
  1. The Top Hat (intro)  
  2. The Car Accident  
  3. The Bank Heist  
  4. Leo Moustache  
  5. Dead Cat  
  (Stars indicate increasing difficulty.)
