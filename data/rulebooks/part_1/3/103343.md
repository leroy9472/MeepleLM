## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
The game simulates the struggle for control of Westeros among the great houses following the death of King Robert Baratheon. The primary objective is to gain dominance by controlling regions containing castles or strongholds.

**Victory Conditions:**
- A player immediately wins by controlling 7 areas containing a castle or stronghold.
- If no player achieves this during the game, the player with the most such areas after 10 rounds wins.
- **House Targaryen Victory:** Collect 7 loyalty tokens (tracked on the victory track) at any time to win immediately.

**Tiebreakers (in order):**
1. Number of strongholds controlled (castles count as 1, strongholds as 2 for this purpose).
2. Higher position on the supply track.
3. Most available power tokens.
4. Higher position on the Iron Throne track.

### 3. Setup
1. **Board & Decks:** Place the game board in the center. Shuffle the wildling deck and place it on the board with the threat token on '2'. Shuffle Westeros decks I, II, and III (and IV if Targaryen is playing) and place them facedown.
2. **Neutral Forces:** Place neutral force tokens on the board based on player count:
   - 3 players: 14 tokens marked '3'
   - 4 players: All 12 tokens marked '4-6', '4-5', and '4'; place King's Court overlay
   - 5 players: 9 tokens marked '4-6' and '4-5'
   - 6 players: No neutral forces
3. **Player Assignment:** Each player chooses or is randomly assigned a house. Take all corresponding components.
4. **Tracks:** Place victory, supply, and influence tokens on their respective tracks as indicated on player screens. Slide influence tokens left to fill gaps for fewer than 6 players.
5. **Dominance Tokens:** The player in 1st position on each influence track claims the corresponding dominance token (Iron Throne, Valyrian Steel Blade, Messenger Raven).
6. **Units & Garrison:** Place starting units and the garrison token on each player's home area.
7. **Power Pool:** Place all power tokens in a central pile. Each player takes 5 (7 for Targaryen).

*(Mother of Dragons Expansion Setup adds vassals, Essos board, loyalty tokens, and loan system.)*

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds, up to a maximum of 10. Each round consists of three phases:

1. **Westeros Phase** (Skipped in Round 1)
2. **Planning Phase**
3. **Action Phase**

After the Action Phase, a Clean Up step occurs. The game ends after Round 10 or when a player reaches 7 victory points.

### 5. Core Mechanics

**Westeros Phase:**
1. **Advance Round Marker:** Move the marker one space. If it reaches 10, the game ends.
2. **Draw Westeros Cards:** Reveal the top card from decks I, II, and III (and IV if Targaryen is playing).
3. **Advance Wildling Track:** Count the number of wildling icons on the revealed cards and move the threat token that many spaces. If it reaches 12, resolve a Wildling Attack.
4. **Resolve Westeros Cards:** In order (I, II, III, IV), resolve the effects of the revealed cards. Common effects include:
   - **Supply:** Players adjust their supply token based on controlled supply icons.
   - **Mustering:** Players may recruit new units in areas with castles or strongholds.
   - **Clash of Kings:** Players bid power tokens to determine positions on the three influence tracks.
   - **Wildling Attack:** Triggers an immediate Wildling Attack.

**Planning Phase:**
1. **Assign Orders:** Each player simultaneously places one order token facedown on each area they control that has a unit. A player may use special order tokens (starred) only up to the number of stars shown on their King's Court track position.
2. **Reveal Orders:** All players flip their order tokens faceup simultaneously.
3. **Use Messenger Raven:** The player holding the Messenger Raven token may choose one action:
   - **Replace an Order:** Swap one of their revealed order tokens with an unused one from their supply.
   - **Look at Wildling Card:** Look at the top card of the wildling deck and choose to place it back on top or at the bottom.

**Action Phase:**
Orders are resolved in three steps, cycling through turn order (determined by the Iron Throne track) until all orders of a type are resolved.

1. **Resolve Raid Orders:**
   - A raid order can remove one adjacent enemy order token of the following types: Raid, Support, or Consolidate Power.
   - A *special* raid order can also remove an adjacent Defense order.
   - If a Consolidate Power order is raided, the raider gains 1 power token and the target discards 1 power token ("pillaging").
   - A land-based raid cannot target a sea area. A sea-based raid can target an adjacent land or sea area.

2. **Resolve March Orders:**
   - The player may move any number of units from the area with the march order into one or more adjacent areas.
   - Units may split up, but only one combat can be initiated per march order.
   - **Movement Restrictions:**
     - Footmen, knights, and siege engines cannot enter sea areas or ports.
     - Ships can move into adjacent sea areas or friendly connected ports, but not into land areas.
   - **Combat:** If units move into an area with enemy units, combat is initiated after all non-combat movement is complete.
   - **Establishing Control:** If a player vacates a land area, they may leave a power token to maintain control.

3. **Resolve Consolidate Power Orders:**
   - The player removes the order token and gains 1 power token from the power pool, plus 1 additional token for each power icon in the area.
   - A *special* consolidate power order can instead be used to initiate mustering in that area (if it contains a castle or stronghold).

**Combat:**
Combat occurs when a player marches into an area with enemy units.

1. **Call for Support:** Both attacker and defender may request support from adjacent areas with a support order. The player controlling the supporting area decides whether to grant support and to whom. A support order can support multiple combats.
2. **Calculate Initial Combat Strength:**
   - **Units:** Footman/Knight/Ship = 1/2/1. Siege Engine = 4 if attacking/supporting an attack on a castle/stronghold, otherwise 0.
   - **Order Bonuses:** March order bonus for attacker. Defense order bonus for defender.
   - **Support:** Combat strength of supporting units (plus +1 for special support order).
   - **Garrison:** The strength of the garrison token is added to the defender.
3. **Choose and Reveal House Cards:** Attacker and defender each secretly choose one house card. These are revealed simultaneously.
4. **Use Valyrian Steel Blade:** The holder may use the token to add +1 to their combat strength. If used, flip it to its faded side.
5. **Calculate Final Combat Strength:** Combine initial strength with modifiers from house cards and the Valyrian Steel Blade.
6. **Combat Resolution:**
   - **Determine Victor:** Highest final strength wins. Tie goes to the player higher on the Fiefdoms track.
   - **Casualties:** The loser must destroy a number of units equal to the winner's sword icons minus the loser's fortification icons (minimum 0). The loser chooses which units to destroy.
   - **Retreat:** The losing army must retreat.
     - **Attacker:** Retreats back to the area they marched from.
     - **Defender:** Retreats to one adjacent empty or friendly area (not the attacker's origin).
   - **Routing:** All retreating units are placed on their side (routed). Routed units have no combat strength and cannot move. If forced to retreat again, they are destroyed.
   - **Siege Engines:** Cannot retreat and are destroyed if they lose.
   - **Clean Up:** Remove the attacker's march order. If the attacker wins, remove the defender's order and any power token in the area.

**Mustering:**
- Triggered by a Westeros card.
- Castles provide 1 mustering point; strongholds provide 2.
- Costs: Footman/Ship = 1 point; Knight/Siege Engine = 2 points (can be upgraded from a footman for 1 point).
- Units must be placed in the area that generated the points. Ships go to an adjacent port or sea area (not one with enemy ships).

**Ship Transport:**
- Land units can move between two land areas connected by consecutive sea areas containing friendly ships.
- Routed ships can be used for transport.
- Enables movement and combat initiation across sea areas.

**Ports:**
- Separate areas that can only hold up to 3 friendly ships.
- Controlled by the owner of the adjacent land area.
- Ships in a port can raid, march to, or support combat in the adjacent sea area, but not in the adjacent land area.
- A consolidate power order in a port is ineffective if the adjacent sea area has enemy ships.

**Controlling Areas:**
- A player controls a land area if they have a unit there or have established control with a power token.
- A power token is placed when vacating an area via a march order.
- Control of an enemy home area is maintained by units or a power token. If vacated without a token, control reverts to the original house.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Track:** Players move their VP token forward for each castle or stronghold they control. A stronghold counts as 2 points.
- **Game End:** The game ends immediately if a player reaches 7 on the victory track. Otherwise, it ends after the 10th round.
- **Winner:** The player with the highest position on the victory track wins. Use tiebreakers if necessary.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Routed Units:** Cannot be chosen as casualties and are destroyed if forced to retreat.
- **Supply Limits:** Are only checked when a Supply Westeros card is resolved. An army is 2 or more units in an area.
- **Garrisons:** Are destroyed permanently if their home area is lost in combat.
- **Tides of Battle (Optional):** After house cards are revealed, both players draw a card from the Tides of Battle deck. The Valyrian Steel Blade can be used to redraw one's card. The card adds combat strength and may add sword, fortification, or skull icons (which cause an unblockable casualty).
- **Alliances:** Are non-binding. Players may not show order tokens, house cards, or bids to opponents.
