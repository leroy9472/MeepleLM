### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Phase 1: Research (3 Actions)  
In turn order, each player takes 3 actions using scientists (levels 1–3):  
- **Research DNA**: Assign scientist to a DNA die. Gain DNA = die value × scientist level.  
  - Wild symbols: Level 2+ scientists may take any combination of DNA types in that rarity.  
  - Special symbols (worker, paddock): Only level 3 can claim; effect is free and permanent.  
- **Increase Cold Storage**: Increase DNA limits by total equal to scientist level (any distribution).  
- **Procure Dino Recipe**: Take recipe if scientist level ≥ recipe’s minimum level. Place in park.  
- **Pass**: Move unused scientist to worker pool (usable in Worker Phase).  
  - Passing does not end your turn; you must take 3 actions.  
  - Pass space is never occupied; multiple passes allowed.  

**After all actions**:  
- Unclaimed die with highest threat pips increases all players' threat level for the round.  

#### Phase 2: Market (2 Actions)  
In turn order, each player takes 2 actions:  
- **Hire Specialist**: Pay row cost. Max 3 specialists. Replacing one loses its benefits.  
- **Build Attraction**: Pay row cost + attraction cost. Place on park board.  
- **Buy Lab Upgrade**: Pay row cost. May replace existing upgrade (lose old effect).  
  - Dino Research II ($3) and DNA Refinement II ($5) must replace their base versions.  
- **Purchase DNA**: Pay row cost ($2–$5), gain DNA. Discard any 1 item from that row (even if empty).  
- **Pass**: Collect $2. May pass both actions for $4 total.  

#### Phase 3: Worker Phase  
Assign workers (and passed scientists) to lab board slots (each used once):  
- **Refining DNA**: Spend basic DNA to gain advanced (1 worker; II allows second).  
- **Create Dinosaurs**:  
  - Pay DNA cost per recipe.  
  - Dinosaur must fit in available paddock.  
  - Increase threat and excitement levels as shown (excitement max 20).  
- **Increase Security**: Pay cost per level. Each level requires 1 worker.  
  - Levels above 10 cost $5 each.  
- **Upgrade Paddock**: Pay cost equal to new capacity (1–4). 1 worker per upgrade.  
- **Venture Capital**: Gain $3 (1st worker), $2 (2nd), $1 (3rd).  

#### Phase 4: Park Phase  
1. **Attract Visitors**:  
   - Draw visitors = excitement level.  
   - Collect $1 per **patron** (yellow), even if not placed.  
2. **Manage Lines**:  
   - Place **hooligans (pink)** first, then **patrons (yellow)**.  
   - Max 1 visitor per dinosaur in exhibit.  
   - Leftover visitors remain at entrance.  
3. **Dinosaurs on the Loose**:  
   - Total Threat = Player Threat + Round Threat (from leftover die).  
   - If Total Threat > Security:  
     - Remove visitors = difference.  
     - **Patrons eaten first**, then hooligans, then those at entrance.  
     - Lose 1 VP per visitor eaten (regardless of type).  
4. **Score Victory Points**:  
   - 1 VP per surviving **patron** in park.  
   - At food attractions: choose 1 VP or $2 per patron.  
   - Hooligans and unplaced patrons score nothing.  

#### Phase 5: Cleanup Phase  
1. **Reset Turn Order**: Lowest VP goes first. Ties retain previous order.  
2. **Refresh Market**:  
   - Discard all items in $2 row.  
   - Slide remaining items up.  
   - Refill empty slots.  
3. **Reveal New Dino Recipes**: Flip next tile if slot is empty.  
4. **Return Workers & Scientists**: To respective pools.  
5. **Remove Visitors**: All returned to bag.  
6. **Resolve Plot Twists**: Trigger end-of-round effects.
