## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
- This is a legacy city-building game where players develop their own city over 24 episodes (8 chapters, 3 episodes per chapter).  
- The goal is to strategically place buildings on your personal game board to maximize your score each episode and earn progress circles.  
- Over time, permanent changes (stickers, rule modifications) are introduced via secret envelopes, evolving the game.  
- The final winner is determined by the total number of progress circles colored in after all 24 episodes.

2. Components  
- 1 personal game board per player (front side used initially)  
- 24 polynomial "building" tiles per player, matching the animal symbol and color on their board (8 yellow residential, 8 red public, 8 blue industrial)  
- Construction card deck (24 cards, shared among all players)  
- 1 scoring cube per player (starts at 10 on the score track)  
- Secret envelopes (8 total, one opened per chapter) containing:  
  - Rule modifications  
  - Overview scoring charts  
  - Stickers for game boards or tiles  
  - Additional materials or hints  
- Writing utensil (to name your city and mark progress)

3. Setup  
- Each player:  
  - Names their city in the top-left box of their board.  
  - Places scoring cube on 10 of the score track.  
  - Takes 24 building tiles matching their board’s animal and color (8 per color: yellow, red, blue).  
- Shuffle the construction card deck and place it face down. This is the shared draw pile.  
- Place discard pile area next to it.  
- **Important**: Do NOT open any secret envelopes until instructed. Each chapter begins with opening a new envelope.  
- Later episodes may have additional setup steps introduced via the secret envelopes.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds in rounds until the episode ends.

1. **Reveal Construction Card**:  
   - Flip the top card of the construction deck and place it face up in the discard pile.  
   - This card shows a building tile (color and shape) to be placed by all players.

2. **Place Building or Pass**:  
   - All players simultaneously take the matching building tile from their stock and place it on their board.  
   - Placement rules:  
     - Must be placed on open light green spaces only.  
     - Cannot be flipped, only rotated.  
     - Cannot be moved once placed.  
     - Cannot overlap prior buildings or cover gray mountain or dark green forest areas.  
     - Cannot cross the river (cannot have parts on both sides).  
     - Can cover rocks (neutral or beneficial depending on scoring).  
     - Can cover trees (penalized in scoring).  
   - **First building**: Must have at least one side adjacent to the river.  
   - **Subsequent buildings**: Must have at least one side adjacent to a previously placed building (diagonal does not count).  
     - Adjacency can be across the river.  
   - If a player cannot (or chooses not to) place the building:  
     - They may **pass**: lose 1 point (move scoring cube down), and place the tile face down in front of them.  
     - Once score reaches 0, passing is no longer allowed.  
     - They may **exit the episode** (no point loss) and sit out the rest of the episode.

3. **Next Round**:  
   - When all players have placed, passed, or exited, begin the next round (flip next card).  
   - The episode ends when either:  
     - All construction cards have been revealed, or  
     - All players have exited the episode.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Tile Placement**:  
  - Players place one tile per round based on the shared construction card.  
  - Tiles must follow adjacency rules and terrain restrictions.  
- **Scoring During Episode**:  
  - Score is tracked in real time using the scoring cube.  
  - Passing costs 1 point.  
- **Score Adjustments at End of Episode**:  
  - +1 per visible tree (each tree in a square counts; some squares have 2 trees → +2)  
  - -1 per visible rock (each rock counts; 2 rocks → -2)  
  - -1 per empty light green space  
  - Future chapters introduce group scoring:  
    - Buildings of the same color form a "group" if connected by adjacent sides (not diagonal).  
- **Score Boundaries**:  
  - If score reaches **50**, immediately color in one progress circle. Score is capped at 50 for the remainder of the episode.  
  - If score drops below 0, negative points carry over and are deducted from future positive gains in the same episode.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After final placement, apply end-of-episode scoring adjustments using the current overview chart (from secret envelope).  
- **Progress Circle Awards**:  
  - **2-player games**:  
    - Highest score: colors in **2** progress circles.  
    - Other player: none.  
  - **3–4 player games**:  
    - Highest score: colors in **2** progress circles.  
    - Second highest (or loser of tie for first): colors in **1** progress circle.  
    - Others: none.  
- **Tiebreaker**:  
  - Fewest empty light green squares in the top row.  
  - If still tied, compare second row, then third, etc.  
- **Stickers**:  
  - Secret envelopes may instruct players to add stickers to their board or tiles.  
  - Stickers go on squares with a small dot in the center (empty green spaces).  
  - Buildings may be temporarily moved to apply stickers after the game.  
- **Final Victory**:  
  - After 24 episodes, the player with the most colored progress circles wins.  
  - Tiebreaker: highest total score across all episodes (if tracked).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a building across the river?**  
  No. The building cannot have parts on both sides of the river.  
- **Can I place a building diagonally adjacent to a prior one?**  
  No. Adjacency requires a shared side (orthogonal only).  
- **Can I pass if my score is 0?**  
  No. Once score is 0, you must either place the tile or exit the episode.  
- **Do I lose points for covering trees during the game?**  
  No. Tree penalty is only applied at the end: -1 per covered tree (i.e., +1 per *visible* tree).  
- **What if I can’t place a tile and don’t want to pass?**  
  You may exit the episode with no penalty.  
- **Are rocks always bad?**  
  Yes, unless modified by a secret envelope rule. Each visible rock is -1 at scoring.  
- **What happens to unplayed cards?**  
  If all players exit early, unplayed cards are not revealed. Episode ends immediately.  
- **Can I place a building on a stickered space later?**  
  Yes, unless the sticker modifies the space to be impassable (per future rules).  
- **Do group rules apply every episode?**  
  Only in episodes where the overview chart or rule sheet specifies it (typically from Chapter 2 onward).
