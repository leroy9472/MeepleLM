    - 1 kept aside (to mark chosen action).
12. Each player gains starting resources per chosen Island Card:
    - Draws [X] Earth Cards to hand.
    - Composts [Y] cards from hand to personal discard pile.
    - Takes [Z] Soil, places next to board.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
1. Starting with First Player and proceeding clockwise, players take turns.
2. On a turn, the Active Player:
   - Chooses 1 of 4 Actions (Plant, Compost, Water, Grow).
   - Resolves the "top" effect of that action.
   - All other players resolve the "bottom" effect.
   - All players simultaneously activate abilities matching the chosen action's color.
3. After turn, pass Active Player Token clockwise.
4. Game ends at the end of the round when any player plants their 16th card (completing 4x4 tableau). That player claims 7 VP bonus.
5. All players complete the round (equal turns).
6. Proceed to Final Scoring.
