# HanaMINIKoji Animal love - Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In HanaMINIKoji Animal Love, two players compete to win the favor of seven Geishas by collecting the most Item Cards associated with each Geisha. Each Geisha has a preferred item type, and players earn favor by having more of that item than their opponent.

**Winning Conditions:**
- Win the favor of **4 Geishas**, OR  
- Accumulate **11 or more Charm Points** (sum of Charm Points from won Geishas).

If one player wins 4 Geishas and the other reaches 11+ Charm Points in the same round, the player with 11+ Charm Points wins.

The game ends immediately when a winning condition is met during Scoring.

### 2. Components
- **7 Geisha Cards** – Each shows a unique item type and Charm Point value (ranging from 1 to 4).
- **21 Item Cards** – Representing 7 types (matching Geishas), 3 of each type.
- **8 Action Markers** – 4 per player (2 sets of 4 different actions, colored or distinguishable by player).
- **7 Victory (or Favor) Markers** – One per Geisha, placed in the center at start.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of **3 phases**:

#### Phase 1: Deal
- Only in the first round. Subsequent rounds skip this phase.
- Starting player removes 1 random card from the full deck and sets it aside unseen.
- Shuffle remaining 20, deal 6 to each player, place 8-card deck aside.

> **Note**: In expansions, this removal step is skipped.

#### Phase 2: Action
- Players alternate turns, starting with the current starting player.
- Each player takes **4 turns** (so 8 total actions per round).
- On your turn:
  1. **Draw 1 card** from the Item Deck.
  2. **Perform 1 action** using one of your face-up Action Markers.
  3. **Flip the used Action Marker face-down** (each action can only be used once per round).

##### Available Actions:
1. **Secret**  
   - Choose 1 card from your hand and place it **face-down** under your Secret marker.  
   - Revealed and scored during Scoring. You may check it anytime.

2. **Discard (Trade-off in some versions)**  
   - Choose **2 cards** from your hand and place them **face-down** under your Discard marker.  
   - These are **not scored** this round. You may check them anytime.

3. **Gift**  
   - Choose **3 cards** from your hand and reveal them.  
   - **Opponent chooses 1** of the 3 and places it on **their side** next to the matching Geisha.  
   - You place the **remaining 2** on **your side** next to their matching Geishas.

4. **Competition**  
   - Choose **4 cards** from your hand and reveal them.  
   - Split them into **two sets of 2 cards each**.  
   - **Opponent chooses 1 set** and places both cards on **their side**.  
   - You place the **remaining 2** on **your side**.

> All played cards (from Gift, Competition, and revealed Secret) are placed next to corresponding Geishas and will be counted during Scoring.

#### Phase 3: Scoring and Update
1. **Reveal Secrets**: Both players reveal their **Secret card** and place it next to the appropriate Geisha.
2. **Compare Item Counts** for each Geisha:
   - If one player has **more cards** of that Geisha’s type → that player **wins the Geisha**.
   - Move the **Victory Marker** to the winner’s side.
   - If **tied** or **no cards played** → marker **stays in center** (neutral).
3. **Calculate Results**:
   - Count how many Geishas each player has won.
   - Sum the **Charm Points** of won Geishas.
4. **Check for Win**:
   - If a player has **4+ Geishas** OR **11+ Charm Points** → **game ends**, that player wins.
   - If both conditions are met by different players in same round, the **11+ Charm Points** player wins.
5. **If no one wins**, proceed to **Update**:
   - Collect **all Item Cards** (table, hands, discards, deck, box) and **shuffle into a new deck**.
   - **Victory Markers stay in place** (no reset).
   - Both players **flip Action Markers face-up**.
   - **Second player becomes new starting player**.
   - Begin next round at **Phase 1: Deal** (with new random card removed).

> **Optional Rule (3-Round Limit)**: Game ends after 3 rounds max. If no one has won, winner is:
> 1. Most Geishas won.
> 2. Tiebreaker: Most Charm Points.
> 3. If still tied: shared victory.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Hidden Information**: Hands are secret; only actions reveal cards.
- **Asymmetric Control**: In Gift and Competition, opponent chooses which card(s) go to you.
- **Resource Management**: Only 4 actions per round; must balance commitment, denial, and bluffing.
- **Card Economy**: Drawing 1 card per turn increases hand size; strategic discarding and commitment are key.
- **Progressive Scoring**: Victory Markers persist; game state evolves across rounds.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Charm Points**: Each Geisha is worth a fixed number (1 to 4), shown on her card.
- **Scoring**: Only at end of each round (Phase 3).
- **Win Conditions**:
  - Win **4 Geishas**, OR
  - Earn **11 or more total Charm Points** from won Geishas.
- **Tiebreaker in Victory**: If one player wins 4 Geishas and the other earns 11+ Charm Points in the same round, the **11+ Charm Points player wins**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I play a card to a Geisha with no Victory Marker movement?**  
  Yes. Even if you don’t win, it may matter in future rounds or for Charm Point totals.

- **What if I have no cards of a type?**  
  You can still win a Geisha if opponent has zero and you have at least one.

- **Can I use the same action twice?**  
  No. Each Action Marker is used once per round, then flipped.

- **What happens to discarded cards?**  
  They are returned to the deck at round end, along with all other cards.

- **Is the removed card public?**  
  No. It is hidden and not revealed at any time.

- **Can I look at my Secret or Discard pile?**  
  Yes. You may check your own hidden cards at any time.

- **What if the deck runs out during Phase 2?**  
  The deck starts with 8 cards and 8 draws occur (4 per player), so it should exactly run out. No reshuffling during a round.
