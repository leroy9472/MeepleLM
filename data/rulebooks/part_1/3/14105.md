## 5. Core Mechanics

### Unit Movement
- **Foot Units**:
  - Light Infantry, Light Bow/Sling: Move 1–2 hexes and battle.
  - Auxilia: Move 1 hex and battle, or 2 hexes and not battle.
  - Medium Infantry: Move 1 hex and battle.
  - Warrior: Move 1 hex and battle, or 2 hexes and battle (must battle after 2-hex move).
  - Heavy Infantry: Move 1 hex and battle.
  - Heavy War Machine: Move 1 hex, cannot battle if moved.
- **Mounted Units**:
  - Light Cavalry: Move 1–4 hexes and battle.
  - Medium Cavalry: Move 1–3 hexes and battle.
  - Heavy Cavalry/Chariot/Elephant: Move 1–2 hexes and battle.

### Combat
- **Ranged Combat**:
  - Only missile-capable units may fire.
  - Range: Typically 2 hexes (3 for Light Sling Infantry).
  - Dice: 2 if unmoved, 1 if moved.
  - Line of sight required; cannot fire through obstructions.
  - Target cannot evade or battle back.
- **Close Combat**:
  - Against adjacent enemy units.
  - Dice rolled based on unit type (e.g., Heavy Infantry: 5 dice).
  - Sword symbols count as hits unless unit is immune (e.g., Light units).
  - Leader symbols score hits if friendly leader is attached or adjacent (except vs. Elephants).

### Special Rules
- **Leaders**:
  - Attached leaders move with units; may detach using helmet-symbol cards.
  - Provide +1 hit on helmet rolls in Close Combat.
  - Allow attached foot units (non-War Machine) to make bonus Close Combat after Momentum Advance.
  - Bolster Morale: Attached unit may ignore 1 flag.
  - Casualty Checks: Roll 2 dice if unit loses blocks (2 helmets = leader eliminated); roll 1 die if unit is eliminated (1 helmet = eliminated).
- **Momentum Advance**:
  - After eliminating or forcing retreat of enemy unit, attacker may move into vacated hex.
  - Cavalry may move +1 hex after Momentum Advance.
- **Bonus Close Combat**:
  - Eligible units after Momentum Advance: Warriors, non-Warrior foot units with attached leader, all mounted units.
  - Optional; may target any adjacent enemy.
- **Evade**:
  - Eligible units: Light units (including Auxilia), War Machines, Medium/Heavy Cavalry vs. foot, Heavy units vs. foot/elephant.
  - Defender rolls evade move (2 hexes toward own edge); attacker rolls combat dice but only matching symbols hit.
  - Evading unit cannot battle back.
- **Retreats**:
  - 1 flag = 1 full movement toward own edge.
  - Warriors retreat 2 hexes per flag; Elephants and Auxilia retreat 1 hex per flag.
  - Blocked retreat: Lose 1 block per unfulfilled hex.
- **Bolster Morale**:
  - Ignore 1 flag if:
    - Leader attached (and survives casualty check).
    - Supported by 2 adjacent friendly units (leader alone counts as support).
    - Full-strength Warrior.
    - On terrain that allows flag ignore (e.g., Fortified Camp).
  - Effects are cumulative.

### Elephants
- **Combat**:
  - Roll same number of dice as target unit would roll (exceptions: 3 dice vs. Elephant, Camel, Warrior, Heavy Chariot; 1 die vs. Leader).
  - Re-roll sword hits for additional damage.
  - Immune to sword hits.
  - No benefit from leaders.
- **vs. Cavalry/Chariot**:
  - Ignore 1 red square hit and 1 flag.
  - Forces +1 hex retreat per flag rolled.
- **Retreat (Rampage)**:
  - Before retreating, roll 2 dice per adjacent unit or lone leader: match symbol to score hit.
  - If retreat path blocked, blocking units lose 1 block per unfulfilled retreat hex.
  - Lone enemy leader in path is eliminated (Victory Banner).

### Terrain Effects
- **Broken Ground**: Mounted units stop and cannot battle if entered; max 2 dice in combat.
- **Forest**: All units stop; only Light, Auxilia, Warrior may battle after entering; max 2 dice in Close Combat, 1 in Ranged; blocks line of sight.
- **Hill**: Max 2 dice when attacking uphill; max 3 (foot) or 2 (mounted) when attacking downhill; blocks line of sight beyond one hill.
- **Rampart/Fortified Camp**: Ignore 1 sword and 1 flag; Fortified Camp reduces attacker’s dice by 1.
- **River (Fordable)**: Stop upon entry; max 2 dice in combat.
- **Marsh**: Stop upon entry; roll 1 die: unit symbol = lose block, leader symbol = leader eliminated.
- **Scalable City Wall**: Stop upon entry/exit; max 2 dice in combat; ignore 1 sword and 1 flag; blocks line of sight.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- Gain 1 Victory Banner for each enemy unit or leader fully eliminated.
