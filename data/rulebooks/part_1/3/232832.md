## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the role of crystal traders striving to construct powerful Golems by acquiring, upgrading, and trading crystals. The objective is to earn the most points by claiming Point Cards (Golem Cards), collecting bonus tokens, and holding valuable crystals at the end of the game.

The game ends when a player claims their 5th Point Card in a 4- or 5-player game, or their 6th in a 2- or 3-player game. After completing the current round, final scoring determines the winner.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Point Card Display**:  
   - Shuffle the Point Cards (Golem back) and place them face-down into a deck.  
   - Reveal 5 cards face-up in a row to the left of the deck.  

2. **Token Placement**:  
   - Place a pile of **Copper Tokens** (2 × number of players) above the **leftmost (1st)** Point Card.  
   - Place a pile of **Silver Tokens** (2 × number of players) above the **second-leftmost (2nd)** Point Card.  

3. **Starting Merchant Cards**:  
   - From the Merchant Card deck (Crystal back), identify the 10 cards with a **purple border** on the face-up side.  
   - Each player receives:
     - One "Create 2" card (gain 2 yellow crystals)
     - One "Upgrade 2" card (upgrade 2 crystals)
   - Return any unused starting cards to the box.

4. **Merchant Card Display**:  
   - Shuffle the remaining Merchant Cards and form a face-down deck.  
   - Reveal 6 cards face-up in a row to the left of the deck.  

5. **Crystal Bowls**:  
   - Separate crystals by color and place them in diamond-shaped bowls in this order (left to right):  
     **Yellow → Green → Turquoise → Magenta**  
   - This reflects increasing value.

6. **Caravan Cards**:  
   - Take one Caravan Card per player, including the **First Player Caravan Card** (marked with a purple crystal icon).  
   - Shuffle and deal one to each player face-down.  
   - All reveal their cards; the player with the **purple crystal icon** becomes the first player.

7. **Starting Crystals**:  
   Based on turn order, give each player the following crystals:  
   - 1st Player: 3 Yellow  
   - 2nd Player: 4 Yellow  
   - 3rd Player: 4 Yellow  
   - 4th Player: 3 Yellow + 1 Green  
   - 5th Player: 3 Yellow + 1 Green  

   Players place these in front of their Caravan Card (or Storage Card).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise, starting with the first player. On a turn, a player must choose **one** of the following four actions:

#### 1. Play a Merchant Card  
- Play one card from your hand face-up in front of you and resolve its effect immediately.  
- Cards have one of three effects:

**a. Gain Crystals (no arrow)**  
- Take the depicted crystals from the bank and add them to your caravan.  

**b. Upgrade Crystals (↑ grey arrow)**  
- Exchange a lower-tier crystal for the next higher one (e.g., Yellow → Green, Green → Turquoise, etc.).  
- You may use multiple upgrades on the same crystal or split them across different crystals.  
- Each upgrade symbol allows one upgrade step.  

**c. Trade Crystals (↓ purple arrow)**  
- Exchange the crystals shown **above** the arrow for those **below** the arrow.  
- You may perform this trade multiple times if you have sufficient crystals.  

> At the end of your turn, ensure your caravan holds **no more than 10 crystals**. Discard excess to the bank.

#### 2. Acquire a Merchant Card  
- Choose one face-up card from the Merchant Card display.  
- To acquire it:
  - Place **one crystal** from your caravan **on each card to the left** of your chosen card (i.e., for each card skipped over).
  - If you take the **leftmost card**, no payment is required — it’s free.
- Take the chosen card into your hand.
- Collect any crystals currently on that card (placed by others during prior acquisitions).
- Slide remaining display cards left to fill the gap.
- Draw a new card from the deck to refill the rightmost slot.

> You may now have more than 10 crystals temporarily; discard down to 10 at the end of your turn.

#### 3. Rest  
- Take all Merchant Cards you have previously played (face-up in front of you) and return them to your hand.  
- This is your entire action. No other effects occur.

#### 4. Claim a Point Card  
- Choose a face-up Point Card from the display.  
- You must have **all crystals shown** on the card in your caravan.  
- Return those crystals to the bank.  
- Take the Point Card and place it **face-down** in front of you (points are hidden until scoring).  
- If you claimed the **leftmost or second-leftmost** card, also take **one token** from the pile above it:
  - Leftmost: take one **Copper Token** (3 pts)
  - Second-leftmost: take one **Silver Token** (1 pt)  
- Slide remaining Point Cards left to fill the gap.
- Draw a new card from the deck to refill the rightmost slot.

> If the **Copper Token supply runs out**, slide the Silver Token pile to the **leftmost position**. From now on, only the leftmost card grants a token (Silver), and the second-leftmost grants nothing.

> You may exceed 10 crystals during the action, but must discard down to 10 at the end of your turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Caravan Limit  
- Maximum of **10 crystals** allowed in your caravan at the **end of your turn**.  
- If over 10, discard excess to the bank. You choose which to discard.

#### Crystal Upgrading Path  
Crystals upgrade in this sequence:  
**Yellow → Green → Turquoise → Magenta**  
- Each upgrade step requires one upgrade action (symbol).  
- Example: Turn 1 Yellow → 1 Green using one ↑; then 1 Green → 1 Turquoise using another ↑.

#### Crystal Supply  
- Crystals are **unlimited**. If supplies run out, use substitutes (e.g., coins, dice).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End Trigger  
- The game ends when a player claims their:  
  - **6th Point Card** in a **2- or 3-player** game  
  - **5th Point Card** in a **4- or 5-player** game  
- Complete the current round so that all players have taken an equal number of turns (i.e., play continues clockwise until the player before the first player takes their turn).

#### Final Scoring  
Each player totals points from:

- **Point Cards**: Sum the point values shown on all claimed cards.
- **Tokens**:  
  - Each **Copper Token** = **3 points**  
  - Each **Silver Token** = **1 point**
- **Remaining Crystals**:  
  - Each **non-yellow crystal** (Green, Turquoise, Magenta) = **1 point**  
  - Yellow crystals are worth **0 points**

#### Winning  
- The player with the **most points** wins.  
- In case of a tie, the **player who took their turn last** (i.e., furthest clockwise from the first player) wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I upgrade a crystal beyond Magenta?**  
A: No. Magenta is the highest tier. Any extra upgrade actions on a Magenta crystal are wasted.

**Q: Can I trade or upgrade during the same turn I acquire a card?**  
A: No. Only one action per turn. Playing a card, acquiring a card, resting, or claiming a Point Card — each is a full turn.

**Q: What happens if I can’t fill the Merchant or Point Card display?**  
A: If the deck runs out, leave empty slots unfilled. Continue play until game end condition is met.

**Q: Can I claim a Point Card if I have more than 10 crystals?**  
A: Yes, as long as you have the required crystals. But you must discard down to 10 at the end of your turn.

**Q: Do I get a token if I claim the second-leftmost card after the Copper runs out?**  
A: No. Once Copper tokens are gone and Silver is moved to the leftmost position, only the **leftmost** card gives a token (Silver), and the second-leftmost gives nothing.

**Q: Can I acquire a Merchant Card and immediately play it?**  
A: Yes, but not on the same turn. You acquire it on one turn, then play it on a future turn.
