## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
The goal of Vindication is to restore your lost Honor and become the most honored player by the end of the game. Players take on the role of flawed characters seeking redemption through exploration, conquest, and overcoming challenges.

In the **Myths & Wonders** expansion, players may trigger a cooperative battle against Ronak, an ancient force of destruction. The objective during this event is to collectively fill all attribute spheres on the Myths & Wonders board to defeat Ronak and be rewarded with loot cards. If all players lose their champions, Ronak wins and resets the conflict.

8. The player on the lowest-numbered starting space gets the First Player token.
9. Draw region tiles from the bag and place them adjacent to starting positions.
10. For **Guilds & Monuments**: each player takes a Monument board and Guild Favor token.
11. For **Myths & Wonders**: place Ronak tile in center, 6 black cubes around it; remove one Academy or Inn from the bag.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Play proceeds clockwise starting with the First Player.
- On a turn, a player may perform **three main actions** in any order and **any number of bonus actions**.
- A round ends when all players have taken a turn.
- The game ends when an End Game Trigger condition is met: finish the current round, then all players take one final turn.

#### Main Actions:
1. **Activate a Person**:
   - Activate own character (free): gain 1 Strength, Knowledge, or Inspiration (or 2 if vindicated).
   - Activate a Companion (pay 1 Influence): gain attributes shown, and use its ability this turn.
2. **Move**:
   - Move up to current speed (starts at 2).
   - Cannot end on another player’s space.
   - After movement, reveal adjacent unexplored hexes by drawing from the bag.
   - If no legal move, dilute 1 cube (Influence → Potential) for +2 movement.
3. **Visit a Region or Rest**:
   - **Visit**: Use adjacent region’s ability (e.g., gain card, upgrade speed, gain attributes).
   - **Rest**: Augment 1 cube (move one sphere right: Potential → Influence or Influence → Conviction).

#### Bonus Actions (unlimited use unless specified):
- **Convert Heroic Attributes**: Spend 1 cube each from two basic attributes to gain 1 heroic attribute (e.g., Strength + Inspiration → Courage). Return one cube to Influence.
- **Gain Proficiency Tile**: Spend 3 of one attribute to take a Proficiency tile of that color (limited supply).
- **Gain Control of a Region**: Spend 1 Conviction to claim an adjacent region you visited this turn. Gain 2 Honor. Opponents gain 2 Honor when visiting it.
- **Recover Influence**: Return any cube (except from Potential) to Influence. If from a Companion, discard it and lose its Honor.
- **Vindicate Yourself**: If Honor ≥25 and no cubes in Potential, flip character tile to light side. Gain 5 Honor. Now gain 2 attributes when self-activating.

#### Guilds & Monuments Expansion – 4th Action:
- **Place Guild Favor Token**:
   - Must move to a new location each turn.
   - Cannot place where another player’s token is.
   - Effects depend on location:
     - **Fortifying Regions**: On your controlled region → flip to fortified side (immune to takeover).
     - **Diplomacy**: On opponent’s region → split Honor (1 each) when others visit.
     - **Barricade**: On empty triangle → gain 2 Honor when opponent lands on or passes through.
     - **Allegiance**: On your Companion → return 1 Influence when activated (instead of paying).
     - **Empowerment**: On your Relic → add 1 Influence when used (instead of removing).
     - **Commendation**: On your Trait → gain 1 Honor each time used.
     - **Destiny’s Fate**: On defeated Monster → roll dice twice, choose result (non-stacking).
     - **Leadership**: On your board → augment 1 Potential → Influence and 1 Influence → Conviction; prevents dilution in that area.
     - **Monument Reconstruction**: On your Monument → contribute attributes/conviction to complete it. Once done, score 15 Honor.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Influence Cubes**: Represent resources. Located in:
  - Player board: Potential (locked), Influence (usable), Conviction (special use).
  - Main board: in attribute spheres (1 cube = 1 influence of that type).
  - Companions: cubes show activation count.
- **Attributes**:
  - Basic: Strength (Red), Knowledge (Blue), Inspiration (Yellow)
  - Heroic: Courage (Orange), Wisdom (Green), Vision (Purple)
  - Heroics formed by converting two basics (e.g., S + I = C).
- **Conviction**: Used to control regions, prevent companion death, or empower draws.
- **Empowered Draw**: Spend 1 Conviction to draw top 3 face-down cards + face-up card; choose one, shuffle rest back.
- **Vindication**: Flip character tile when Honor ≥25 and no Potential cubes. Grants +5 Honor and doubles self-activation yield.
- **Region Control**: Spend Conviction to control a region. Gain 2 Honor immediately, 2 when others visit, and 2 more at game end.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **End Game Trigger**: When any face-up End Game Trigger card condition is met, finish the current round, then all players take one final turn.
- **Final Scoring**:
  - **Mastery Tiles**: Awarded per attribute to player with most "mastery total":
    - 1 per card of that color
    - 2 per Proficiency tile
    - Treachery cards do not count
    - Tie → no one gets the tile
  - **Secret Quests**: Reveal and score Honor for completed objectives.
  - **End Game Bonuses**: From cards (e.g., Monster, Trait) with end-game Honor.
  - **Controlled Regions**: 2 Honor each (4 if adjacent to your fortified monument in Leaders & Alliances).
  - **Loot Cards**: Awarded after defeating Ronak (Myths & Wonders).
- **Total Honor** determines winner.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Most Conviction
  2. Least Potential
  3. Least trigger tokens collected

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I move 0 spaces?** No. Must move at least 1. If blocked, dilute 1 cube for +2 movement.
- **Can I recover cubes from Potential?** No. Only from Influence, Conviction, or other areas.
- **What if I lose a Companion with pets?** Transfer pets to another Companion for free. If none, pets are under your character (no benefit). Abandoning Companion loses pets.
- **Can I use a Proficiency tile after spending it?** No. Once spent (as 2 attributes), it is removed from the game.
- **Can I control a region without visiting it?** No. Must visit the same region this turn.
- **What happens if Ronak wins?** All attribute cubes on the battle board return to players’ Influence. Black cubes reset. Play continues until Ronak is provoked again.
- **Can I use multiple Guild Perks in one turn?** Yes, if you can afford the rapport cost. Each perk can be used once per turn.
- **What if I can’t place my Guild Token?** You must be able to move it to a valid, unoccupied location. If impossible, the game state may require resolution via house rule (not specified).
