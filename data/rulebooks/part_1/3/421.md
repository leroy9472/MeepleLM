### 1. Lore & Objective
The goal of 1830 is to amass the greatest combined wealth in personal cash and stock value when the game ends. Company treasuries do not count toward a player’s final wealth. The game simulates railroad investment and operation in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada, where players act as robber barons buying, selling, and operating railroads for profit.

### 2. Components
- Game board (1830 Classic and 1830+ sides)
- 144 cards: private company certificates, railroad corporation certificates, train cards (2s through diesels), and a priority deal card
- 12 corporation charters
- 180 bills ($1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500) totaling $12,000
- 155 hexagonal tiles: 139 track tiles (yellow, green, brown, gray), 16 board tiles
- 35 tokens: 34 station tokens, 1 miscellaneous token
- 40 markers: 24 share markers, 2 round markers, 3 license markers, 5 uncertainty markers, 6 number markers

### 3. Setup
- Choose a banker.
- Distribute $2400 equally among players.
- Place the 1830 Classic board face up.
- Place 6 private company certificates (SV, CS, DH, MH, CA, BO) face up.
- Stack initial offering share certificates on the board with the president's certificate on top.
- Stack trains: 6x 2-trains, 5x 3-trains, 4x 4-trains, 3x 5-trains, 2x 6-trains, 6x diesels.
- Use only yellow and tan track tiles initially.
- Place 8 corporation charters (PRR, NYC, C&O, B&M, B&O, Erie, NNH, N&W) next to the board.
- Auction private companies: players bid or pass, starting with the banker. Highest bidder chooses first, next highest chooses next, etc.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Stock Round (SR):** Players take turns to sell shares, buy one share, and optionally sell more shares. The round ends when all players pass consecutively. Priority Deal card passes to the left of the last active player.
2. **Operating Round (OR):** Private companies pay revenue. Then, floated corporations operate in order of descending stock value (tiebreakers: rightmost, then topmost). Each corporation:
   - May lay or upgrade one track tile.
   - May place one station token (home station placed free on first turn).
   - Must run trains on legal routes.
   - Chooses to pay dividends or retain revenue.
   - Adjusts stock price (right for dividends, left for withholding).
   - May purchase trains.
3. **Phases:** Triggered by train purchases:
   - Phase 2: First 3-train bought → green tiles allowed, 2 ORs between SRs.
   - Phase 4: First 4-train bought → 2-trains removed, max 3 trains per corp.
   - Phase 5: First 5-train bought → brown tiles allowed, privates close, max 2 trains, 3 ORs.
   - Phase 6: First 6-train bought → 3-trains removed, diesels available.
   - Phase 7: First diesel bought → 4-trains removed.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Stock Market:**
  - Selling one 10% share drops price one row.
  - Fully player-owned at SR end → price up one row.
  - Dividends paid → price right one column (up if at row end).
  - No dividends → price left one column (down if at row end).
  - Yellow/orange/brown zones grant special privileges (see below).
- **Certificate Limits:**
  - Max 5 certs (60%) per corp, except in orange/brown zones where limits are lifted.
  - Total cert limit by players: 28 (2p), 20 (3p), 16 (4p), 13 (5p), 11 (6-7p).
  - Yellow/orange/brown zone shares do not count toward total limit.
  - Brown zone: buy multiple shares in one turn.
- **Private Companies:**
  - SV, CS, DH, MH, CA, BO.
  - Effects:
    - CS: Free tile lay on B-20.
    - DH: Free tile and station on F-16.
    - MH: Exchange for 10% NYC share.
    - CA: Receive 10% PRR share.
    - BO: Receive B&O presidency.
  - Sellable between players at any price in SRs (after first).
  - Corporations may buy privates in ORs (after first 3-train) for 0.5x to 2x face value.
  - Close when first 5-train is bought (except BO closes when B&O buys first train, MH closes when exchanged).
- **Track Laying:**
  - Must connect via legal route to a station.
  - No track may end off-grid or against blank/gray/red sides.
  - Upgrades must preserve all existing track.
  - Special cases: NYC may lay A7 on E-19; Erie may lay oo2 on E-11 when green tiles available.
- **Running Trains:**
  - Route must include at least one of the corp’s stations.
  - Max cities = train number (diesels unlimited).
  - No reusing track or city in one route.
  - Opposing stations block routes unless you have a station or space.
  - Red hexes only as start/end.
- **Train Purchases:**
  - Must buy train if legal route exists and no train owned.
  - Buy from bank (in order), open market (face value), or other corps (any price ≥$1).
  - Phase limits: 4 trains (early), 3 (after 4-train), 2 (after 5-train).
  - Excess trains discarded to open market.
  - Forced purchase: if corp can’t afford, president pays difference. If still short, sell shares. Bankruptcy if still insufficient.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **End Triggers:**
  - Bank runs out of money → complete current OR set, then end.
  - Player bankruptcy → game ends immediately.
- **Final Wealth:**
  - Player cash + value of all owned shares (price × quantity) + face value of any remaining privates.
  - Highest total wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Change of Presidency:** When another player exceeds your share count, exchange president’s cert for two 10% certs from them. If tie, player clockwise from you becomes president.
- **Receivership:** If corp forced to buy train and combined corp+president funds insufficient, corp takes loan, manager rotates cert, no dividends until loan repaid.
- **Tile Upgrades:** Must maintain all existing track; orientation must match.
- **Station Placement:** Must have legal route; first station free at home city; costs $40 (first additional), $100 (later).
- **Revenue Calculation:** Sum of city values on route; president chooses payout (all dividend or all retained); bank pool shares pay into corp treasury.
