### 1. Lore & Objective
Dead of Winter is a thematic, cooperative survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. Players control groups of survivors in a colony trying to endure the harsh winter and complete a shared main objective. However, among them may be a hidden betrayer whose secret goal is to sabotage the colony.

**Objective:**  
- The game ends immediately if the main objective is completed, morale reaches zero, or the round track reaches zero.  
- Each player wins only if they personally complete their secret objective. Otherwise, they lose.  
- In cooperative variants, all players share the goal of completing the main objective.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of two phases:

#### Player Turns Phase
1. **Reveal Crisis:**  
   - Reveal the top crisis card.  
   - (Long Night Bandits): Place bandits as instructed. If no instructions, place 2 bandits randomly.

2. **Roll Action Dice:**  
   - Each player rolls 1 die + 1 per survivor they control.  
   - Place all dice in the unused pool.

3. **Player Turns:**  
   - Starting with the first player, each player takes a turn.  
   - During a turn:  
     - The player to the right draws a crossroads card.  
     - It triggers if the active player meets its condition at any time.  
     - Player performs actions until passing.  
   - Actions include: attack, search, barricade, clean waste, attract, use abilities, play cards, move, request, hand off, spend food, add cards to crisis, or vote to exile.

#### Colony Phase
1. **Raxxon Containment Code (Long Night):** Check and resolve if applicable.  
2. **Pay Food:**  
   - Remove 1 food token per 2 survivors (including helpless) at colony (rounded up).  
   - If insufficient food:  
     - Add 1 starvation token.  
     - Decrease morale by number of starvation tokens in supply.  
3. **Check Waste:**  
   - For every 10 cards (rounded down) in the waste pile, decrease morale by 1.  
4. **Resolve Crisis:**  
   - Shuffle and reveal cards added to the crisis.  
   - Each matching symbol = +1 point. Non-matching = –1 point.  
   - If total < number of non-exiled players → resolve crisis.  
   - If total ≥ number of non-exiled players → crisis prevented.  
   - If total ≥ number + 2 → colony gains 1 morale.  
5. **Add Zombies:**  
   - Colony: 1 zombie per 2 survivors (rounded up), placed in order (1–6).  
   - Non-colony: 1 zombie per survivor.  
   - Noise tokens: Roll D6 per token; add zombie on 3 or lower.  
   - Overrun: If no space and no barricade, kill lowest-influence survivor.  
6. **Bandits Scavenge (Long Night):** Each active bandit draws 1 card from its location, adds it face up to bandits’ hideout.  
7. **Check Main Objective:** If completed, game ends immediately.  
8. **Move Round Tracker:** Move down 1. If reaches 0, game ends.  
9. **Pass First Player Token:** Pass to the right.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Actions Requiring a Die
- **Attack:** Spend die ≥ survivor’s attack value. Kill zombie and roll for exposure.  
- **Search:** Spend die ≥ survivor’s search value. Draw 1 card; may make noise to draw more.  
- **Barricade:** Spend any die to place barricade in empty entrance.  
- **Clean Waste:** Spend any die; remove 3 cards from waste pile (colony only).  
- **Attract:** Spend any die; move 2 zombies to current location.  
- **Survivor Ability:** Use if die ≥ ability’s number.  
- **Bandits Hideout (Long Night):** Spend die to attack, search, or attack the hideout; roll die to determine effect.

#### Free Actions (No Die Cost)
- **Play a Card:** Use effect, equip, or discard.  
- **Add Card to Crisis:** Add from hand or equipped items (face down).  
- **Move Survivor:** Once per survivor per turn. Roll for exposure after.  
- **Spend Food Tokens:** Spend 1 token to increase any unused die by 1.  
- **Request:** Ask for card; if given, must be played immediately (not added to crisis).  
- **Hand Off:** Transfer equipped item to survivor at same location.  
- **Vote to Exile:** Initiate vote; all players vote yes/no. Majority wins; first player breaks ties.

#### Killing Zombies
- Always roll for exposure after killing a zombie.  
- At colony, choose which zombie to kill.

#### Adding Survivors
- Add survivor card and standee to colony.  
- May use immediately, but no extra die until next roll.  
- Cannot add if no colony space.

#### Killing Survivors
A survivor dies when:  
- Overrun (lowest influence)  
- 3+ wounds (includes frostbite)  
- Bitten (roll exposure)  
- Card effect  

**Effects:**  
- Remove standee and card.  
- Decrease morale by 1.  
- Equipped items: return to hand (colony) or shuffle into location deck (non-colony).  
- If leader dies, choose new leader.  
- If last survivor dies: discard hand, draw new survivor, make leader. (Player Elimination: player is out.)

#### Exile
- Triggered by vote. Exiled player:  
  - Draws exiled secret objective.  
  - Moves all colony survivors to non-colony locations (no exposure roll).  
- Rules for exiled:  
  - Cannot vote or add cards to crisis.  
  - Cannot spend food tokens (but may play food cards to boost dice).  
  - Cannot add to waste pile (cards removed from game).  
  - Colony does not lose morale if their survivor dies.  
  - New survivors appear at non-colony locations.  
- (Long Night Bandits): Non-betrayer exiled player becomes bandit leader.  
- (Critical Rule): If 2 exiled players and neither is betrayer → morale drops to 0.

#### Morale
Decreased by:  
- Survivor killed: –1  
- Starvation: –1 per starvation token in supply  
- Waste: –1 per 10 cards (rounded down)  
- Exile: 2 exiled non-betrayers → morale to 0  
- Crisis: if not prevented  
- Card effects  

Increased by:  
- Crisis prevented with +2 or more → +1  
- Certain card effects  

Game ends immediately if morale reaches 0.

#### Long Night Modules
- **Improvements:**  
  - Place advancement tokens via effects.  
  - If tokens ≥ requirement, add to colony blueprint and activate.  
- **Bandits:**  
  - Placed via crisis or effects.  
  - Attackable; count as survivors for zombie addition.  
  - Hideout: can be attacked or searched.  
- **Raxxon:**  
  - Search requires exposure roll.  
  - Use pill items to gain side-effect cards.  
  - Special zombies: only killed by attack; must be targeted first.  
  - Containment Code: place dice at Raxxon during player turns; resolve in colony phase.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Ties:** First player breaks all ties (voting, simultaneous effects).  
- **First Player Token:** Passes to right unless Long Night vote prevents it.  
- **Colony Occupancy:** If full, cannot trigger crossroads or play cards that add survivors.  
- **Random Locations:** Roll D6, match to location number.  
- **Card Counting:** Number of cards matters, not card values (e.g., "Food 3" = 1 card).  
- **Action Dice:** Shared among survivors in a group; not tied to individuals.  
- **Equipped Items:** Cannot be unequipped except via hand off or crisis.  
- **Crossroads Cards:** Must be drawn every turn; if not triggered, return to bottom.  
- **Limited Actions:** Movement is once per survivor per turn; other actions can be repeated.  
- **Killing Zombies:** Always roll for exposure.  
- **Remove vs. Kill:** “Remove” does not decrease morale unless specified.  
- **Exposure Roll Timing:** After movement or zombie kill.  
- **Frostbite:** At start of turn, survivors with frostbite tokens gain an additional wound.  
- **Bite Spread:** Spreads to lowest-influence survivor; stops if killed or blank roll.  
- **Player Elimination:** If enabled, player is out when last survivor dies.  
- **Solo Play:** Uses special rules with imaginary second player, prestige track, and period-based mechanics.
