- Fill board columns: 4 W cards (left), 8 S cards (middle two columns), 4 E cards (right).  
- Choose correct campfire board for player count (2–3–4 players). Place it next to the main board.

  - Each player selects one full row of 4 cards from the board and draws 1 card from the N deck.  
  - Refill the emptied row immediately.  
- Each player chooses a side of their starting ground card and places it in their meadow area.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Game lasts 6 rounds (2–3 players) or 8 rounds (4 players).  
- Players take turns clockwise.  
- On your turn:  
  1. Place one path token in an unoccupied notch on either:  
     - Main board → perform top action (draw card + optionally play one)  
     - Campfire board → perform bottom action (special action + optionally claim goal)  
  2. Resolve action based on placement.  
  3. Optionally fulfill a goal if on campfire board.  
- After all players exhaust path tokens:  
  - Collect all path tokens.  
  - Pass first player token to the left.  
  - Advance round marker.  
- At halfway point (when round marker passes hourglass):  
  - Discard all board cards and shuffle them into their decks.  
  - Replace S deck holder with N deck holder.  
  - Refill board with new cards from W, N, N, E columns.  
- Game ends after final round.

5. Core Mechanics  
**Main Board Action (Top):**  
- Place path token in a notch.  
- Move along row/column in direction indicated; count spaces equal to number on token. ? = choose 1–4.  
- Take that card. Refill spot immediately.  
- Optionally play one card from hand (can be the one just drawn).  

**Campfire Board Action (Bottom):**  
- Place path token in unoccupied notch.  
- Choose one of four special actions:  
  1. Take any face-up card from the board (cannot play a card this turn).  
  2. Take 2 road tokens (cannot play a card).  
  3. Look at top 3 cards of any deck; take 1, put other 2 on bottom in any order (cannot play).  
  4. Play up to 2 cards from hand (cannot draw).  
- After action, optionally claim a goal if eligible.  

**Claiming Goals:**  
- On campfire board, adjacent goal tokens form pairs.  
- If you have both symbols of a pair visible in your meadow, you may place one of your bonus tokens in the space between them.  
- Only one bonus token per pair.  
- Must place during a campfire board turn.  
- Place in order: 2, then 3, then 4.  

**Card Types & Play Rules:**

  - Must meet all requirements (symbols visible in meadow).  
  - Can use "choice" requirements (A/B = pick one).

Solo Variant (Rover):  
- Setup: Use 2-player campfire board. Place 3 random goals. Block 2 notches.  
- Rover uses a face-down pile of opponent-colored path tokens.  
- Rover goes first each round.  
- On Rover’s turn:  
  - Flip top token.  
  - If ?: place on campfire (any free notch) → no card drawn.  
  - Else: place on main board (use solo game token + color markers to determine position), take indicated card, add to Rover’s deck.  
- Rover does not claim goals or use bonus tokens.  
- After each round: collect all tokens, shuffle Rover’s pile.  
- At halfway: same as multiplayer.  
- End game: after 6 rounds.  
- Score player and Rover (all cards in Rover’s deck).  
- Compare to solo scoring table:  
  - <39: Distracted  
  - 40–49: Fruitful trek  
  - 50–59: Amazing species  
  - 60+: Collection worth displaying  
- Player wins if score ≥ Rover’s.

Solo Campfire Variant:

- Choose unused color for solo opponent; set aside its 3 bonus tokens (2, 3, 4) as pool.  
- When player draws a ? path token:  
  - Place on unused campfire notch.  
  - If no notch available: discard, skip bonus phase, end turn.  
  - Else:  
    - If no bonus tokens left in pool: skip.  
    - Else: roll D6.  
      - Roll 6: reroll.  
      - Roll 1–5: consult placement chart; place lowest-value bonus token in corresponding goal pair space (or nearest clockwise if occupied).  
- Solo player scores points for placed bonus tokens.  
- Difficulty:  
  - Each ground card in solo deck = 1 point (base)  
  - Or = 2 points (hard mode)

- **Can I cover a ground symbol?** No. Ground symbol must remain visible.  
- **Can I use a symbol covered by another observation card?** No. Only visible symbols count.  
- **Can I ignore all requirements by discarding cards?** No. At least one requirement must be met.  
- **Bench action:** Place path token on bench → play 1 card (no draw).  
- **Solo game: Rover’s ? token** → place on campfire, no card drawn.  
- **Solo Campfire: Rolling 6** → reroll until 1–5.  
- **Ties in solo game?** Player wins if score ≥ Rover’s.
