### 1. Lore & Objective  
Paths of Glory simulates World War I, focusing on strategic operations across Europe, the Near East, and surrounding regions. Players control either the Central Powers (CP) or the Allies (AP), competing for control of Victory Point (VP) spaces and fulfilling strategic objectives. The game ends when a player achieves an automatic victory, an armistice is declared, or the turn limit is reached. Victory is determined by the VP track position and specific endgame conditions.

**Objective:**  
- CP wins automatically if VP ≥ 20 during War Status Phase.  
- AP wins automatically if VP ≤ 0 during War Status Phase.  
- Otherwise, at Combined War Status ≥ 40 (Armistice) or Turn 20:  
  - AP wins if VP ≤ 9.  
  - CP wins if VP ≥ 13, or VP ≥ 11 if Treaty of Brest-Litovsk has been played.  
  - Draw otherwise.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with regions, supply sources, and VP spaces  
- Unit counters (Armies, Corps) for CP (e.g., GE, AH, TU) and AP (e.g., FR, BR, RU, US)  
- Fort markers  
- Trench markers (Level 1 and 2)  
- Strategy Cards (Mobilization, Limited War, Total War decks)  
- Trackers: Victory Point (VP), War Status (3 markers), Replacement (RP), Turn, Russian Capitulation  
- Event markers (e.g., MEF Beach Head, Siege, Destroyed Fort)  
- Reserve Box and Replaceable Units Box  
- Dice (d6)  

### 3. Setup  
- Place units per setup table (rulebook p32 or board symbols). Optional: Move 1 RU Corps to Lutsk and 1 AH Corps to Stanislaw from Reserve.  
- Set markers:  
  - Turn Marker on August 1914  
  - VP Marker on 10  
  - War Status Markers on 0  
  - Replacement Markers (GE, AH, Allied, BR, FR, RU) on 0  
  - US Entry Marker on "US Neutral"  
  - Russian Capitulation Marker on "God Save the Tsar"  
  - Mandated Offensive (MO) Marker on MO Tables  
  - Action Round Charts: 6 Action Markers per player  
- Shuffle Mobilization decks; set Limited and Total War decks aside.  
- CP may add "Guns of August" to hand. Each player draws 7 cards.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows this sequence:  
1. **Mandated Offensive (MO) Phase**  
2. **Action Phase** (6 alternating rounds; CP starts)  
3. **Attrition Phase**  
4. **Siege Phase**  
5. **War Status and Victory Check Phase**  
6. **Replacement Phase** (AP first)  
7. **Draw Strategy Cards Phase**  
8. **End of Turn Phase** (Advance Turn Marker)  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
**Mandated Offensive (MO):**  
- Each player rolls 1d6; place MO marker on result.  
- If result is "None" or neutral nation, no effect.  
- If nation’s capital is enemy-controlled, shift MO marker right (AH requires both Vienna and Budapest captured).  
- French MO becomes "French Mutiny" after event; no attack required, but French attacks without US in FR/BE/GE incur -1 VP.  
- GE MO is "None" after "H-L Take Command" event.  
- RU MO is "None" after "Bolshevik Revolution" event.  
- If MO not fulfilled, -1 VP during War Status Phase.  

**Action Phase (6 rounds):**  
Each player takes one action per round:  
- **Operations (OPS):** Spend OPs to activate spaces for Move or Attack (not both).  
  - Cost: 1 OP per nationality in space. Exceptions:  
    - BE units in Antwerp, Ostend, Calais, Amiens count as BR.  
    - FR and US units in FR/GE count as one nationality.  
    - MEF Army: 3 OPs if supplied via MEF Beach Head.  
    - Other Allied corps via MEF Beach Head: +1 OP each.  
  - Move: Complete all moves before combat. Units gain control of entered spaces (except besieging forts).  
    - CP cannot end move in Amiens, Calais, Ostend until "Race to the Sea" played or CP War Status ≥ 4 (except after combat advance).  
    - Units cannot enter neutral spaces (except Limited Greek Entry).  
    - Only NE Armies (MEF, BR NE, FR OR, RU CAU, TU YLD/AoI) can enter NE map.  
    - Only 1 RU Corps can move/SR between "To Caucasus" and NE per turn.  
  - Attack: Designate target space. Cannot attack space with only retreated units.  
    - Multi-national attack requires one space with all participating nations.  
    - London attacks require support from FR/BE.  
- **Strategic Redeployment (SR):**  
  - Cost: Corps = 1 SR point, Army = 4 SR points.  
  - Cannot play SR in two consecutive rounds. "Salonika" counts as SR.  
  - Move unit through friendly spaces to supplied friendly space (including besieged enemy forts).  
  - OOS units cannot SR. Unit can SR only once per round.  
  - Sea SR: All nations (except RU) can SR by sea between friendly ports.  
    - CP: Only via GE/RU ports (not besieged Riga).  
    - AP: Only via non-GE/RU ports (via Constantinople only if Gallipoli Allied-controlled).  
  - Restrictions:  
    - CP cannot SR into Amiens, Calais, Ostend until War Status ≥ 4 or "Race to the Sea".  
    - Max 1 CP Corps SR to/from NE per turn (TU Corps exempt).  
    - RU units SR only in Russia/Russian NE; max 1 RU Corps to/from NE per turn.  
    - Max 1 BR (including AUS) Corps SR by sea to/from NE per turn.  
  - Reserve SR:  
    - Corps to/from Reserve requires unit of same nationality in destination (not for BR ANA/TU SN).  
    - Corps to Reserve: Any friendly space.  
    - Cannot SR if nation’s capital enemy-controlled/besieged (except BE, SB).  
- **Replacement (RP):**  
  - Mark RP points per card on General Records Track.  
  - Cannot play RP in two consecutive rounds.  
  - "A" RPs for Allied minor nations (ANA, AUS, BE, CND, MN, PT, RO, GR, SB).  
  - US gains 1 RP per Allied card after "Over There" played.  
- **Event:**  
  - Execute card instructions.  
  - Cards with * are removed after use.  
  - Neutral Entry: One neutral nation per turn (BU, GR, IT, RO). US/TU enter via other mechanics.  
  - Reinforcement: One per nation per turn; all units must be placeable in supply.  
    - Armies: Nation’s capital or friendly supply source. FR Armies to Orleans if Paris full. US Armies to any FR port.  
    - Corps: Reserve Box (except BR ANA, TU SN).  
- **Offer Peace Terms:**  
  - CP if VP ≥ 11, AP if VP ≤ 9.  
  - If accepted, game draw.  
  - If rejected, offering player rolls d6; adjust VP per Peace Terms Table.  
- **Automatic Operation (1 OP):** Free action without card.

**Attrition Phase:**  
- OOS units eliminated: Armies permanently, Corps to Replaceable Box.  
- OOS friendly space without intact fort becomes enemy-controlled.  
- Trench Attrition: OOS L2 trenches become L1; L1 trenches removed.  
- Exceptions: TU units in Medina in supply; SB units always in supply in Serbia.

**Siege Phase:**  
- Roll 1d6 for each besieged fort. Fort destroyed if roll > Loss Factor.  
- -2 DRM in August/September 1914.

**War Status Phase:**  
- Adjust VP per table (e.g., MO failure: +1 VP for opponent).  
- Check automatic victory (CP VP ≥ 20 or AP VP ≤ 0).  
- Check armistice (Combined War Status ≥ 40).  
- Check War Commitment Level:  
  - War Status ≥ 4: Add Limited War deck, reshuffle. TU enters war (no neutral entry limit).  
  - War Status ≥ 11: Add Total War deck, reshuffle.  
- Note: "OberOst" and "Race to the Sea" depend on War Status, not War Commitment.

**Replacement Phase:**  
- Spend RP points (AP first). Unused points lost.  
- Cannot spend RP if nation’s capital enemy-controlled/besieged (except BE, SB; OOS unbeseiged Paris OK).  
- Units with dot (●) cannot take replacements.  
- Units tracing supply to non-native source (e.g., GE units to Sofia/Constantinople) cannot receive RP.  
- Recreated Armies: Place as reinforcements. Exceptions:  
  - SB Army: Belgrade or Salonika (if controlled).  
  - BE Army: Brussels, Antwerp, Ostend (if supplied); else Calais.  
  - BR ANA Corps: Rebuilt in Arabia, not Reserve.

**Draw Cards Phase:**  
- Draw to 7 cards.  
- Discard all combat cards from previous turn. May discard in-hand combat cards before drawing.  
- If CP at Total War and AP not, AP may discard IT/RO Entry cards as combat cards.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **VP Changes:**  
  - Gain VP by capturing red VP spaces, enemy MO failure, or card effects.  
  - VP marker starts at 10; moves up for CP gains, down for AP gains.  
- **End Conditions (any):**  
  - Automatic victory during War Status Phase.  
  - Armistice (Combined War Status ≥ 40).  
  - End of Turn 20.  
- **Final Victory:**  
  - AP win: VP ≤ 9.  
  - CP win: VP ≥ 13, or VP ≥ 11 if Treaty of Brest-Litovsk played.  
  - Draw otherwise.
