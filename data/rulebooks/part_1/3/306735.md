## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Under Falling Skies is a solo dice management game set during an alien invasion. Players must defend their city and advance research to stop the alien threat before the mothership destroys their base.  

**Objective**: Advance your research marker to the top of the research track (space 11) to win.  

**Losing Conditions**:  
- The damage marker reaches the skull (maximum damage).  
- The mothership descends to the row marked with a skull.  

### 2. Components  
- 5 worker dice (3 gray, 2 white)  
- 1 excavator  
- 1 research marker  
- 1 energy marker  
- 1 damage marker  
- Mothership tile with 5 drop points  
- 5 purple ships (aliens)  
- 4 white ships (aliens)  
- Sky tiles (4)  
- City tile (e.g., Roswell)  
- Base tiles A and B  
- Robot dice (blue, used in full game)  
- Campaign components (notebook, scenario cards, character cards, etc.)  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place city tile (blue side up) and align base tiles below it as indicated.  
2. Stack sky tiles above city tile in gradient (dark on top).  
3. Set threat level (0–4); flip that many sky tiles randomly to "goopy" side.  
4. Place mothership above sky tiles, aligned with 5 columns.  
5. Place one purple ship on each drop point.  
6. Set research, energy, and damage markers to starting positions.  
7. Place excavator on starting space.  
8. Set white ships aside (for spawning).  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has three phases:  

#### **1. Dice Phase**  
- Roll all 5 worker dice (3 gray, 2 white).  
- Place one die per column (one die may be placed ahead of the excavator).  
- When placing a die:  
  - All ships in that column descend by die value (or die value –1 if placed in AA gun room).  
  - Ships trigger effects where they land (not spaces passed).  
  - If a ship descends into the city, base takes 1 damage; ship returns to mothership.  
  - After placing a white die, re-roll all unplaced dice.  
- If a die is placed ahead of the excavator:  
  - Distance ahead must be ≤ die value.  
  - Does not trigger room effect.  
- Move red damage marker down one space (lose if it hits skull).  

#### **2. Rooms Phase**  
- Resolve rooms in any order. Remove dice after resolving.  
- You may choose not to use a die, but must still remove it.  
- Room effects:  
  - **AA Gun**: No effect in this phase (already reduced movement in Dice Phase).  
  - **Excavated Tunnel**: No effect.  
  - **Energy Room**: Gain energy equal to room value (max 8).  
  - **Jet Fighter Room**: Destroy all ships on explosion spaces with value ≤ room value.  
    - Purple ships return to mothership.  
    - White ships are removed from the game.  
  - **Research Room**: Move research marker up spaces whose total value ≤ room value.  
    - Win immediately if marker reaches space 11.  
  - **Robot Room (Full Game)**: Install a robot die (value = room value, max 6) in an excavated space. Robot starts exhausted.  
- **Excavating**:  
  - If a die was placed ahead of excavator, pay 1 energy to move excavator to that space.  
  - Distance moved must be ≤ die value (illegal otherwise).  
- **Multi-space Rooms**: Only activate if all spaces have dice. Value = sum of dice ± modifier.  
- **Energy Cost**: If room has lightning icons, pay that much energy to activate.  

#### **3. Mothership Phase**  
1. **Move Mothership Down One Row**  
   - Any ships in that row return to mothership (not drop points).  
2. **Resolve Mothership Action** (based on icon in rightmost column):  
   - **Excavator –n**: Move excavator back n spaces (not beyond start).  
   - **Research –n**: Move research marker down n spaces (not below start).  
   - **White Ship +n**: Add n white ships to mothership (for spawning).  
   - **Blast**: Take 1 damage.  
   - **Skull**: Lose immediately.  
3. **Spawn Ships**  
   - Spawn all ships on mothership to drop points, up to 5.  
   - **Order**: Purple ships first, then white.  
   - **Placement Rules**:  
     - First, fill drop points in columns with no ships.  
     - Then, fill columns where the highest ship is farthest from mothership.  
     - If tied, player chooses.  
   - Unspawned ships remain on mothership for next round.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Die Placement**: One per column. White die placement triggers re-roll of remaining dice.  
- **Excavator**: Only one die may be placed ahead. Moving it costs 1 energy and must be legal (distance ≤ die value).  
- **Enemy Ships**:  
  - Move when dice are placed.  
  - Trigger space effects upon landing.  
  - Descending into city = 1 damage.  
- **Robots (Full Game)**:  
  - Installed in excavated rooms via robot rooms.  
  - Exhausted when used (rotated 45°).  
  - Value decreases by 1 after use; removed if value drops below 1.  
  - Ready at end of Rooms Phase.  
- **Energy**: Max 8. Spent to activate rooms or move excavator.  
- **Research**: Progress is per room; multi-space rooms needed to reach 11.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win**: Research marker reaches space 11 (immediately).  
- **Lose**:  
  - Damage marker reaches skull.  
  - Mothership reaches skull row.  
- **End of Round**: Game ends immediately upon win or loss.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip using a die?** Yes, but must remove it.  
- **What if I can’t pay energy cost for a room?** Room has no effect.  
- **Can robots be in unexcavated rooms?** No. If excavator moves back over a robot, remove it.  
- **Do ships on mothership move with it?** Yes, if they are at the bottom of the tile.  
- **Can I use a robot in the same turn it’s installed?** No. Newly installed robots are exhausted.  
- **What if all columns have ships during spawn?** Spawn in column with highest ship farthest from mothership.  
- **Can white ships return after being shot down?** No. Only purple ships return to mothership.  
- **Does mothership movement in Dice Phase trigger its effect?** No. Only movement in Mothership Phase triggers row effect.
