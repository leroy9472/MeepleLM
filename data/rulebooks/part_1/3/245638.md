7. **Turn Order**: Randomly determine; place lions on flags accordingly.
8. **Character Deck**: Shuffle Level II and III decks; place II on top of III. Keep Level I separate.
9. **Favor & Crown Tokens**: Place 4 favor tiles left of Castle. Place cap tile above 2-crown favor tile. Place 4 crown tokens on first matching-color card in display (top to bottom, right to left).
10. **Character Display**: Place 4 cards per row (Upper, Central, Lower City) from character deck.
11. **Starting Cards**: Form 2-card pairs: 4 pairs (4P), 3 pairs (3P), 2 pairs (2P). Place near board.
12. **Starting Choices**:
   - In reverse turn order: Take a card pair OR place pilgrim on a free corner.
   - In turn order: Take the other action and gain influence/immediate bonus.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round has six phases:
- **A. Roll Dice**: First player rolls all dice in the pool.
- **B. Draft Dice**: In turn order, players take one die, place in holder, and assign to a city location:
  - Castle: Dice must be in ascending order (1–6, left to right).
  - City (Upper/Central/Lower): Dice must be in descending order (6–1, left to right).
  - Die tokens count as neutral dice in <4P games.
- **C. Retrieve Dice**: Resolve locations top to bottom (Castle → Upper → Central → Lower). Within each, resolve dice left to right:
  - **Castle**: Take a favor tile (immediate bonus, crowns).
  - **City**: Acquire a character card (pay cost in guards/coins = die value), gain influence, trigger bonuses.
  - **Distress Action**: If unable/unwilling, gain up to 2 coins and 2 guards.
  - **<4P Rule**: When a die token is triggered, discard highest-influence card (leftmost tiebreaker); flip token face down. After location, discard remaining cards and flip tokens back up.
- **D. New Player Order**: Total crowns (from tokens, favor tiles, current turn order spot). Highest becomes first player; reverse order among ties.
- **E. Influence Income**: In new order, activate each die on player board by color:
  - Gray: Guards
  - Orange: Coins
  - Purple: Pilgrim steps
  - Green: Victory points
  - White: Choose any color’s reward
  - Reward value based on position on matching influence track. Max 20 coins/guards.
- **F. Invest in Voyage**: In new order, each may invest in one voyage (pay cost in coins/guards), place disc on wind rose. Multiple players per voyage allowed.

After Phase F:
- If no cards left in deck, end game.
- Else, reset: return favor tiles, refill 12 character cards, reposition crown tokens.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Dice Drafting**: Dice determine turn order, card cost, and income type.
- **Card Acquisition**: Pay cost in guards/coins based on die value; gain influence and bonuses.
- **Pilgrim Movement**: Triggered by purple income or card effects. Move along one-way roads; place disc on monasteries to claim bonuses.
- **Turn Order**: Based on crown count each round.
- **Bonuses**:
  - Immediate: Triggered when card acquired.
  - Phase C: Triggered when acquiring matching-class card.
  - Phase E: Ongoing income modifiers.
  - Game End: Scored in final tally.
- **Diplomas**: Icons on cards/monasteries; score sets of unique icons (1–5) for VP.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
