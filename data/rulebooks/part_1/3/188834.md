### 3. Setup  
1. **Select Fascist Track** based on player count:  
   - 5–6 players: 1 Fascist + Hitler (Hitler knows the Fascist)  
   - 7–8 players: 2 Fascists + Hitler (Hitler does **not** know Fascists)  
   - 9–10 players: 3 Fascists + Hitler (Hitler does **not** know Fascists)  
2. Place the appropriate Fascist track next to the Liberal track.  
3. Shuffle all 17 Policy tiles (6 Liberal, 11 Fascist) into one deck; place face down on Draw pile card.  
4. Prepare one envelope per player containing:  
   - 1 Secret Role card (Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler)  
   - 1 corresponding Party Membership card (Liberal or Fascist)  
   - 1 Ja! Ballot card  
   - 1 Nein Ballot card  
5. Shuffle envelopes and deal one to each player. Players view their Secret Role **in secret**.

- **5–6 players:**  
  - "Everyone close your eyes."

  - "Everyone open your eyes."

  - "Everyone close your eyes and make a fist."  
  - "All Fascists **who are not Hitler**, open your eyes and acknowledge each other."  
  - "Hitler, keep eyes closed but extend your thumb."  
  - "Fascists, note who has the thumb—this is Hitler."  
  - "Everyone close eyes and lower hands."  
  - "Everyone open your eyes."

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:

#### 1. Election  
- **Pass Presidency**: The President placard moves clockwise to the next player (even if previously in power).  
- **Nominate Chancellor**: President selects any eligible player as Chancellor Candidate.  
  - **Eligibility**: The **last elected** President and Chancellor are ineligible to be nominated as Chancellor.  
  - **Exception**: In 5-player games, only the last elected **Chancellor** is ineligible; the last President may be nominated.  
- **Vote**: All players vote **Ja!** (Yes) or **Nein** (No) simultaneously.  
  - **Success**: If **majority** (more than 50%) vote Ja!, the government is elected.  
  - **Failure**: If tied or Nein majority, government fails.  
    - President placard moves clockwise.  
    - Election Tracker advances by 1.  
    - If **3 failed elections in a row**:  
      - Enact top Policy tile from deck (face up).  
      - Ignore any Presidential Power.  
      - Reset Election Tracker.  
      - All players become eligible for Chancellor.  
      - If <3 cards remain, shuffle discard pile into new deck.

#### 2. Legislative Session  
- President draws **top 3 Policy tiles**, views them secretly, discards one face down.  
- Passes remaining 2 to Chancellor.  
- Chancellor views the 2, discards one face down, enacts the last by placing it face up on correct track.  
- **No communication** allowed between President and Chancellor during session.  
- **No random selection** (e.g., shuffling, flipping randomly). Players must intentionally choose.  
- Discarded tiles are never revealed.  
- If <3 tiles remain in deck, reshuffle discard pile (excluding unused drawn tiles) into new deck.

#### 3. Executive Action  
Only if a **Fascist Policy with a power** is enacted. President **must** use the power before next round.

**Presidential Powers (based on Fascist Policy count):**  
- **1–2 Fascist Policies**: **Investigate Loyalty**  
  - President picks a player (not previously investigated).  
  - Player shows their **Party Membership card** (not Secret Role).  
  - President sees loyalty (Liberal/Fascist), returns card.  
  - President may lie about result.  
- **3–4 Fascist Policies**: **Call Special Election**  
  - President chooses any player to be next Presidential Candidate.  
  - After this election, normal rotation resumes.  
  - Special Election bypasses term limits.  
- **5 Fascist Policies**: **Policy Peek**  
  - President views top 3 Policy tiles, returns them in same order.  
- **6 Fascist Policies**: **Execution**  
  - President executes one player by name.  
  - If player is Hitler → Liberal victory.  
  - Otherwise, player is removed (no speech, voting, or role reveal).  
  - Game continues.

**Veto Power (after 5 Fascist Policies enacted):**  
- After President discards one and passes two to Chancellor:  
  - Chancellor may say: “I wish to veto this agenda.”  
  - President may say: “I agree to the veto.”  
    - Both policies discarded.  
    - President placard passes left.  
    - Election Tracker advances by 1 (counts as failed government).  
  - If President refuses, Chancellor must enact one policy as normal.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Hidden Roles**: Only Fascists know Hitler’s identity (except in 5–6 player games, Hitler knows the Fascist).  
- **Lying Permitted**: Players may lie about policy draws, investigations, etc.  
- **Truth Enforcement**:  
  - Hitler **must** reveal identity if elected Chancellor after 3 Fascist Policies.  
  - Hitler **must** reveal identity if executed.  
- **Term Limits**: Last elected President and Chancellor cannot be nominated as Chancellor (with 5-player exception).  
- **Election Tracker**: Resets whenever a policy is enacted (by government or populace).  
- **Discard Pile**: Reshuffled when deck has <3 cards.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends immediately when any win condition is met.

**End Game Triggers:**  
- 5 Liberal Policies enacted → **Liberal Victory**  
- 6 Fascist Policies enacted → **Fascist Victory**  
- Hitler elected Chancellor **after** 3 Fascist Policies → **Fascist Victory**  
- Hitler executed → **Liberal Victory**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a player be investigated twice?** No. Each player may be investigated only once.  
- **Can the President pass policies one at a time?** No. Both must be passed simultaneously to avoid signaling.  
- **Can Hitler be nominated as Chancellor if ineligible?** No. Term limits apply regardless of role.  
- **What if the deck runs out during draw?** Reshuffle discard pile (excluding drawn but not yet discarded tiles).  
- **Does Special Election skip players?** No. After Special Election, normal order resumes.  
- **Can a dead player’s role be revealed?** No. Only Hitler is revealed upon execution. Others remain secret.  
- **Can you veto a Liberal policy?** No. Veto only applies when **Fascist** policies are drawn and passed.  
- **Does veto trigger Presidential Power?** No. Vetoed policies do not enact; no power is granted.
