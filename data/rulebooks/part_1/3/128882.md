### 1. Lore & Objective
Avalon is a game of deception and deduction set in the world of King Arthur. Players are loyal servants of Arthur attempting to complete quests to rid the world of evil. However, Minions of Mordred have infiltrated the group, aiming to sabotage these quests. The Good team wins by successfully completing 3 quests. The Evil team wins by sabotaging 3 quests or, if the Good team completes 3 quests, by correctly identifying and assassinating Merlin.

### 2. Components
- Player role cards (including Merlin, Assassin, Morgana, Mordred, Percival, and various Good and Evil roles)
- Leader token
- Quest success and failure cards
- Lady of the Lake token
- Excalibur token (in some variants)
- Mission success/failure tracking tokens

### 3. Setup
1. Assign the leader token to a random player.
2. Shuffle player role cards based on player count, including Merlin (Good) and Assassin (Evil).
3. Deal one role card to each player face down.
4. Conduct the secret identity reveal:
   - All players close eyes.
   - Minions of Mordred (Evil players) open eyes to acknowledge each other.
   - Minions close eyes, then give a thumbs up/down signal.
   - Merlin opens eyes to identify the Minions of Mordred.
   - All players open eyes.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Team Selection**: The leader selects a team for the quest based on the required number for that mission.
2. **Voting**: All players simultaneously vote to approve or reject the team.
   - If majority approves, the quest proceeds.
   - If majority rejects, the leader token passes left, and a new leader proposes a team.
   - If 5 consecutive teams are rejected, the Evil team wins immediately.
3. **Quest Resolution**: 
   - Each team member receives one success and one failure card.
   - Players secretly choose one card to play face down into the quest pile.
   - The leader collects and shuffles the cards before revealing them.
   - If all cards are success, the quest passes. If at least one failure card appears, the quest fails.
   - The 4th quest (in games with more than 7 players) requires 2 or more failure cards to fail.
4. **Repeat** until 3 quests are passed or failed.
5. **Assassination Phase**: If Good completes 3 quests, the Evil team (led by the Assassin) must collectively guess Merlin's identity. If correct, Evil wins.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Team Building**: Leader selects team, all players vote.
- **Voting Patterns**: Early in the game, players often vote to reject teams they're not on to avoid suspicion.
- **Quest Mechanics**: Good players must play success cards; Evil players may play either success or failure.
- **Lady of the Lake**: After the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quests, the player with the token may check another player's loyalty (but not their role), then passes the token.
- **Character Abilities**:
  - Merlin knows all Evil players but must remain hidden.
  - Percival knows Merlin but doesn't know which player is Merlin vs. Morgana.
  - Mordred is Evil but unknown to Merlin.
  - Morgana appears as Merlin to Percival.
  - Assassin leads the Evil team in identifying Merlin at game end.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Good wins by completing 3 successful quests.
- Evil wins by either:
  - Causing 3 quests to fail, or
  - Correctly identifying Merlin after Good completes 3 quests.
- Immediate Evil victory if 5 consecutive team proposals are rejected in a single round.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hammer Rule**: The 5th proposed team for any mission must pass, regardless of votes, or Evil wins.
- **Fourth Mission**: In games with more than 7 players, the 4th quest requires 2 failure cards to fail.
- **Lady of the Lake Chain**: Information from the Lady creates a chain of trust, but the first player's allegiance is unknown.
- **Double Fail**: When two Evil players on a mission both play failure cards (except on the 4th mission), it can reveal too much information to Good.
- **Excalibur**: In variants with Excalibur, a player can convert a failure card to success, adding strategic depth.
