### 1. Lore & Objective
Go is an ancient Chinese board game, possibly the oldest in the world, played by two players who aim to control more territory on the board than their opponent. The game emphasizes strategy, balance, and negotiation, promoting a win-win mindset rather than total conquest. Black moves first, and players take turns placing stones on the intersections of a grid. The goal is to surround empty areas and capture opponent’s stones to maximize one’s score.

### 2. Components
- **Board**: A grid of intersecting lines, typically 19×19, but also 13×13 or 9×9 for beginners. The board has marked points called "hoshi" or star points.
- **Stones**: Two sets of stones, black and white. Black has one more stone than white (e.g., 181 black, 180 white on a 19×19 board).
- **Bowls**: Containers for holding stones during play.

### 3. Setup
- The board starts empty.
- Black always moves first.
- Players sit opposite each other.
- In handicap games, Black places 2 or more stones on star points before White’s first move.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. Players alternate turns, placing one stone per turn on an empty intersection.
2. A stone or group of connected stones is captured when all its adjacent liberties (empty neighboring points) are occupied.
3. Players may pass instead of playing a stone.
4. The game ends after two consecutive passes.
5. Dead stones are removed, and territory is counted.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Liberties**: Empty adjacent points next to a stone or group. A group must retain at least one liberty to avoid capture.
- **Chains**: Connected stones of the same color that share liberties.
- **Capture**: Removing opponent’s stones when their last liberty is filled.
- **Suicide Rule**: A move that leaves one’s own group with no liberties is illegal unless it captures opponent stones.
- **Ko Rule**: A player cannot immediately recapture a single stone if doing so would repeat the previous board position. A move elsewhere must be played first.
- **Eyes**: Empty spaces fully surrounded by a player’s stones. A group with two or more eyes is alive and cannot be captured.
- **Seki**: A mutual life situation where neither player can capture the other’s group without self-capture. No points are scored for the shared liberties.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- The game ends after two consecutive passes.
- Players agree on which groups are dead and remove them from the board.
- **Scoring**:
  - One point for each empty intersection in a player’s territory (surrounded by their living groups).
  - One point for each captured stone (prisoner).
- **Komi**: White receives 5.5 or 7.5 points compensation for moving second, preventing draws.
- The player with the higher total score wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you play in your own territory?** Yes, but it reduces your score by one point.
- **What if a dispute arises about dead stones?** Play resumes under special rules: the player who did not pass last moves first, and each pass gives a prisoner to the opponent. Play continues until the group is captured or proven alive.
- **How are dame (neutral points) handled?** They are filled during or after the game and do not count toward either player’s score.
- **Can a game end in a draw?** No, due to komi (e.g., 5.5 points), the score difference is always odd, ensuring a winner.
