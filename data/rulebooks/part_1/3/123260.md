#### General Setup

2. **Tile Stacks**:  
   - Shuffle A, B, and C stacks separately.  
   - Place the One More Round tile into the bottom half of the C stack (specifically: shuffled with 6/9/12 C tiles for 2/3/4 players).  
3. **Real Estate Market**:  
   - Draw 7 tiles from the A stack and place faceup in the 7 leftmost spaces (from $0 to $10).  
4. **Goal Tiles**:  
   - Shuffle 20 Goal tiles.  
   - Reveal 2/3/4 public goals on the Market Board for 2/3/4 players.  
   - Discard any revealed goal involving Lakes or Investment Markers.  
5. **Basic Tiles**: Place 4 of each (Suburbs, Community Park, Heavy Factory) on designated Market Board spaces.

#### Player Setup  
For each player:  
1. Randomly choose a start player. Give them the Start Player Marker.  
2. Each player takes:  
   - One color set: Borough Board, Income Cylinder, Reputation Cube, Population Meeple, 3 Investment Markers, 3 Wood Pieces  
   - $15 in coins  
   - 2 random face-down Goal Tiles  
3. **Private Goal**: Each player looks at their 2 goals, keeps one (face-down), returns the other to the box.  
4. **Initial Placement**:  
   - Place Population Meeple on 2 of the Population Board.  
   - Place Income Cylinder on 0 of Income Track.  
   - Place Reputation Cube on 1 of Reputation Track.  
   - On Borough Board:  
     - Place Suburbs tile in center slot.  
     - Place Community Park adjacent (right or above, depending on board orientation).  
     - Place Heavy Factory adjacent to Community Park.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, perform these actions in order:  

#### 1. Place One Building Tile or Investment Marker  
Choose **exactly one** of the following:  

**a) Take a Tile from the Real Estate Market**  
- Pay the tile’s cost + the market cost above it.  
- Place the tile adjacent to any of your existing tiles (faceup or facedown).  
- Resolve effects in **Tile Effect Resolution Order** (see below).  

**b) Take a Basic Tile**  
- Take one of: Suburbs, Community Park, or Heavy Factory.  
- Pay only the tile’s printed cost (no market cost).  
- Place it like any other tile.  
- **Then**: Choose and discard one tile from the Real Estate Market (pay only the market cost, if any).  

**c) Take a Tile as a Lake**  
- Choose any tile from the Real Estate Market.  
- Pay **only** the market cost (tile cost is ignored).  
- Flip it facedown and place adjacent to your tiles.  
- Gain $2 for each adjacent **faceup** Industrial, Civic, Residential, or Commercial tile.  
- Note: Lakes are the backs of A, B, and C tiles (not basic tiles).  

**d) Place an Investment Marker**  
- Choose one of your tiles (including Lakes) without an existing marker.  
- Pay the tile’s original cost again.  
- Place marker on the tile’s upper-left corner.  
- **Double all conditional effects** of the tile for the rest of the game.  
- **Then**: Choose and discard one tile from the Real Estate Market (pay only market cost).  

#### 2. Collect or Pay Money (based on Income)  
- If Income ≥ 0: collect that amount from the supply.  
- If Income < 0: pay |Income| to the supply.  
- If you can’t pay:  
  - Pay what you can.  
  - Lose 1 Population per unpaid $1.  
  - Population cannot go below 0.  

#### 3. Adjust Population (based on Reputation)  
- If Reputation > 0: increase Population by that amount.  
- If Reputation < 0: decrease Population by that amount.  
- If Population would drop below 0: pay $1 per point owed. If you can’t pay, nothing further happens.  

**Red Line Effects (Population Track):**  
- When Population **crosses upward** past a red line: immediately reduce Income and Reputation by 1 each.  
- When Population **drops below** a red line: immediately increase Income and Reputation by 1 each.  
- Income and Reputation cannot go below -5 or above 15.  

#### 4. Add a New Tile to the Real Estate Market  
- Slide remaining tiles right to fill the gap.  
- Draw a new tile:  
  - First from A stack, then B, then C (in that order).  
  - If the **One More Round** tile is drawn:  
    - Set it aside.  
    - Draw a replacement from C stack.  
    - Continue normal turn.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Tile Effect Resolution Order  
When placing a tile, resolve in this order:  
1. Pay tile cost (tile + market).  
2. Immediate effect (top-right of tile).  
3. Conditional effect on placed tile (bottom).  
4. Conditional effects from **adjacent** tiles.  
5. Conditional effects from **non-adjacent** tiles in your borough.  
6. Effects from **other players’ tiles** that affect you.  
7. Effects your tile has on **other players’ boroughs**.  

#### Tile Types & Categories  
- **Residential (Green)**: Often boosts Population, interacts with schools, parks.  
- **Industrial (Yellow)**: Often boosts Income, may hurt Reputation.  
- **Commercial (Blue)**: Often boosts Income, interacts with offices, restaurants.  
- **Civic (Gray)**: Often boosts Reputation, may cost Income.  

#### Icons & Interactions  
Some tiles trigger based on icons:  
- Restaurant, Office, Airport, School, Skyscraper, Car Dealership  
- Example: Business Supply Store gains +1 Income per Office icon in play.  

#### Investment Markers  
- Double **conditional effects** only.  
- Do **not** double icons or immediate effects.  
- Do **not** count as two tiles.  
- Do **not** re-trigger adjacent tile effects when placed.  

#### Lake Mechanics  
- Backs of A/B/C tiles only. Cost $0.  
- When placed: gain $2 per adjacent faceup non-Lake tile.  
- When placing a faceup tile next to a Lake: gain $2.  
- With Investment Marker on Lake: gain $4 per adjacent faceup tile.  
- Waterfront Realty: gain extra $2 per adjacent non-Lake tile; with Investment Marker, gain $4 extra (total $6).  

#### Tile Progression  
- Tiles drawn in order: A → B → C.  
- One More Round tile appears in C stack. Signals game end.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End of the Game  
- When One More Round tile is revealed:  
  - Set it aside.  
  - Finish the current round.  
  - All players take **one more full round** (same number of turns).  
- After last player’s turn, proceed to final scoring.  

#### Final Scoring  
**Red lines are ignored** during final scoring.  

**Step 1: Award Goals**  
- **Public Goals**: Award Population bonus to the **single player** who meets the goal. Ties = no one scores.  
- **Private Goals**: Only the owner can score. Score only if **no other player** ties.  
- All goals are scored based on tiles **in your own borough only**.  

**Step 2: Convert Money to Population**  
- Return money to supply.  
- Gain 1 Population per $5 (round down).  
- Keep leftover money ($0–$4) as tiebreaker.  

#### Winning and Tiebreaking  
1. Highest Population wins.  
2. Tie? Highest Reputation.  
3. Tie? Highest Income.  
4. Tie? Most leftover money.  
5. Still tied? Play another game to decide.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can Income/Reputation go beyond -5 or 15?** No. Cap at extremes.  
- **Do Investment Markers trigger adjacent tile effects?** No. Placement does not re-trigger other tiles.  
- **Can you have multiple of the same tile?** Yes. Effects stack.  
- **When does “after this one” trigger?** Only for tiles placed **after** the referenced tile.  
- **Do red lines affect Income/Reputation during final scoring?** No. Ignore during scoring.  
- **Can a Lake be adjacent to another Lake?** Yes, but no $2 gained for adjacency between Lakes.  
- **Can you place tiles on top of the Borough Board?** No. Must be adjacent to tiles.  
- **Does “for every” include the tile itself?** Yes, unless specified otherwise.  
- **Does “each of your” include the tile itself?** Yes, if it matches the type.  
- **What happens if you can’t pay negative Income?** Pay what you can, lose Population for the rest.
