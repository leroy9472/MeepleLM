## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Five clans compete for dominance over the Isle of Skye. Players act as chieftains, expanding their clan territories by purchasing and placing landscape tiles, managing gold income, and strategically scoring victory points (VPs). The player with the most VPs after the final round wins and becomes King of Skye.

2. Components  
- 1 double-sided game board (use front for 2–4 players, back for 5 players)  
- 16 scoring tiles  
- 73 landscape tiles (green backs)  
- Gold coins  
- 5 player screens  
- 5 landscape tiles with castles (color-coded backs)  
- 5 scoring tokens (one per player color)  
- 5 discard markers (axes)  
- 1 starting player marker (piper)  
- 1 round token  
- 1 cloth bag  
- Rulebook  

3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center. Use the front side for 2–4 players, back for 5 players.  
2. Shuffle the 16 scoring tiles and place one face-up on each of the spaces labeled A–D on the board. Return the remaining 12 to the box.  
3. Place the round token on the first space of the round track.  
4. Form a general supply of gold coins next to the board.  
5. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
   - 1 player screen  
   - 1 castle landscape tile (in their color)  
   - 1 scoring token  
   - 1 discard marker  
   (Return unused components to the box.)  
6. Each player places their scoring token on space "0" of the scoring track.  
7. Each player places their castle tile face-up in front of them—this is the first tile of their clan territory.  
8. The youngest player takes the starting player marker.  
9. Place all landscape tiles into the cloth bag and shuffle thoroughly.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 6 rounds (5 rounds in a 5-player game). Each round proceeds through six phases:

1. Income  
2. Draw Tiles and Set Prices  
3. Discard a Tile  
4. Buy a Tile  
5. Build  
6. End of Round and Scoring  

After the final round, conduct Final Scoring.

Phase 1: Income  
Each player receives:  
- 5 gold (from their castle)  
- +1 gold per whisky barrel tile connected to their castle via roads  
Starting in Round 3:  
- Additional gold = (number of players ahead on the scoring track) × (gold value shown next to current round on round track)

Phase 2: Draw Tiles and Set Prices  
- Each player draws 3 landscape tiles from the bag and places them face-up in front of their player screen.  
- Behind their screen, each player:  
  - Assigns their discard marker to one tile (to be returned to the bag)  
  - Assigns at least 1 gold to each of the other two tiles (set prices)  
- Remaining gold is kept hidden in hand.  
- Once all players are ready, remove screens simultaneously.

Phase 3: Discard a Tile  
- Each player returns the tile marked with their discard marker to the bag.  
- Shuffle the bag thoroughly.

Phase 4: Buy a Tile  
- Starting with the starting player, players take turns clockwise.  
- On your turn, you may:  
  - Buy one tile from another player by paying its set price in gold.  
    - The buyer takes the tile and places it beside their screen.  
    - The seller receives the paid gold and takes back the gold they assigned to that tile.  
  - Pass (if unable or unwilling to buy).  
- After all players have bought or passed:  
  - Each player takes any remaining tiles in front of them.  
  - All gold assigned to those tiles is lost and returned to the general supply.

Phase 5: Build  
- All players must place all tiles acquired this round (purchased or kept) into their clan territory, following:  
  - Each new tile must share at least one full edge with an existing tile (including other tiles placed this turn).  
  - Matching terrain types must align on shared edges (pasture–pasture, mountain–mountain, water–water).  
  - Roads do not need to connect.  
- If a tile cannot be placed legally, it is returned to the bag (no refund of gold).  
- Note: Completed areas are fully enclosed by different terrain types (roads do not block or enclose).

Phase 6: End of Round and Scoring  
- All players score VPs based on the scoring tile(s) active for the current round (indicated by A–D on scoring track).  
- Each scoring tile is used exactly three times during the game.  
- Players advance their scoring token by the number of VPs earned.  
- A player must have at least one qualifying feature to score a tile (e.g., at least one whisky barrel for whisky scoring).  
- In case of a tie for first place on competitive scoring tiles (e.g., "most whisky"):  
  - All tied players receive full top-tier points (5 VPs).  
  - Second-place points (2 VPs) are not awarded unless there's a tie for second.  
- Pass the starting player marker clockwise.  
- Move the round token forward one space.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Tile Drafting & Auction: Players simultaneously select and price tiles, then participate in a turn-based auction.  
- Territory Building: Expand your clan’s land with terrain-matching placement.  
- Dynamic Income: Base income + conditional bonuses based on whisky and position.  
- Scoring Rotation: Four scoring tiles rotate through use, each active three times.  
- Final Scoring: Based on scrolls, gold conversion, and completed areas.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Final Scoring occurs after the last round. Players earn VPs for:  

Scrolls (on placed tiles):  
- 1 VP per 2 sheep (round down)  
- 1 VP per 2 whisky barrel tiles (round down)  
- 1 VP per 2 ships (round down)  
- 1 VP per cattle  
- 1 VP per broch (round tower)  
- 1 VP per farm  
- 1 VP per lighthouse  

Bonus: If a scroll is in a completed area (fully enclosed by different terrain), score double VPs.  

Gold Conversion:  
- 5 gold = 1 VP (any leftover gold)  

Winning:  
- Highest total VPs wins.  
- Tiebreaker: Remaining gold after conversion.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I assign more than 1 gold to a tile?** Yes—minimum is 1, but you may assign more.  
- **What if I can’t place a tile during Build?** Return it to the bag. No money is refunded.  
- **Do roads need to connect?** No. Roads may start/end at edges.  
- **Are roads considered terrain for completing areas?** No. Only pasture, mountain, and water enclose areas.  
- **Can a tile be part of multiple completed areas?** Yes, if fully enclosed in multiple ways.  
- **Can a tile be part of multiple scoring squares?** Yes—squares of 4 tiles can overlap.  
- **What if I have no gold to assign during pricing?** You must still assign at least 1 gold per kept tile. If you have no gold, you cannot legally set prices—this should be avoided via income management.  
- **Do I get my assigned gold back if my tile isn’t bought?** No—only if it is bought. Otherwise, it is lost.  
- **Can I buy my own tile?** No—only from other players.  
- **Does the discard happen before or after revealing prices?** After. Discard is Phase 3; prices are revealed in Phase 2.
