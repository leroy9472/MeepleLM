**Winning**  
- Highest Star total wins.  
- Tiebreakers: Most Gold → Fewest Class-colour Dice.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Boost Dice**: Colourless; can be used anywhere; value 7–8.  
- **Disguise (Trait)**: Alignment unaffected by Trait arrow, but must move toward Evil per card.  
- **Search (Skill)**: Can look in bag; pick any die (TUME). Gain 2 Gold if Yellow placed. Cannot replace Boost Die with standard die.  
- **Sleight of Hand (Skill)**: Moving die does not trigger new Attribute Action or Gold. Close gaps after move.  
- **Jewelled Dagger/Longsword**: Allow values >6 for Attribute scoring only. Do not affect Trait requirements.  
- **Open Lock**: Cannot use discounts when buying from top of Market Deck. Trait purchase still moves Alignment.  
- **Charisma Token**: Counts as 1 Gold in Market Phase only.  
- **Familiars (F&F)**: Not an Attribute row; Familiar action not an Attribute Action. Scored separately.  
- **Call to Adventure (F&F)**: Triggers change in Roll Phase dice count (2 per card → 1 per card).
