### 1. Lore & Objective

For over a century, the city-state of Thandar has thrived as a beacon of peace through trade. Born from the once-warlike Empire’s shift toward diplomacy, Thandar now draws people from every nation and species. Yet beneath its prosperity lies constant political and physical conflict.

In **Hero Realms**, players take on the roles of powerful heroes building personalized decks of actions, items, and champions to gain influence, defeat rivals, and dominate through strength or cunning.

**Objective**: Be the last player standing by reducing all other players’ Health to zero. Players start with 50 Health. In solo or team modes, victory conditions may vary.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

Each turn has three phases:

#### 1. Main Phase
At any time during this phase, you may:
- Play cards from your hand.
- Use **Expend**, **Ally**, or **Sacrifice** abilities.
- Spend Gold to **Acquire** cards from the Market.
- Use Combat to **Attack** opponents or their Champions.

#### 2. Discard Phase
- Lose all unspent Gold and Combat.
- Discard all in-play **Actions** and **Items**.
- Discard all cards remaining in hand.
- **Prepare** all your Champions (return them to vertical orientation).

#### 3. Draw Phase
- Draw 5 cards from your personal deck.
- If your deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck and continue drawing.

> If your deck is exhausted mid-turn, reshuffle your discard pile immediately to continue.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Card Types
- **Actions & Items**:
  - Played for immediate effect (primary ability).
  - Remain in play until Discard Phase.
  - May have **Expend**, **Ally**, or **Sacrifice** abilities.

- **Champions**:
  - Remain in play until stunned or sacrificed.
  - Start in **prepared** (vertical) state.
  - Can use **Expend** ability by turning sideways.
  - Have **Defense** value: damage equal to or exceeding this in one turn stuns them.
  - **Damage does not carry over** between turns.

#### Expend Ability (●)
- Turn card sideways to use.
- Can be used any time during your Main Phase, including the turn played.
- Cards with "prepare" effects can allow reuse in same turn.

#### Ally Ability (faction icon)
- Trigger when you have **at least one other card of the same faction** in play.
- Can be used **once per turn**, at any time during your Main Phase.
- Order of play does not matter.

#### Sacrifice Ability (🔥)
- Use by placing card in the **Sacrifice Pile**.
- Only triggers if you activate the ability — not if removed another way.
- **Fire Gem exception**: If a Fire Gem would go to Sacrifice Pile, return it to its stack instead.

#### Gold & Combat Pools
- **Gold Pool**: Accumulates from card effects. Used to buy cards from Market.
- **Combat Pool**: Accumulates from card effects. Used to attack.

> Unused Gold and Combat are lost at the end of your turn.

#### Acquiring Cards
- Pay Gold equal to card’s cost (top-right corner).
- Place acquired card into your **discard pile**.
- Replace Market slot with top card of Market Deck.
- Acquiring is **not playing** — abilities do not trigger.

#### Attacking
- **Combat Pool** is used to attack.
- **Attack a Champion**: Assign any amount of Combat. If total damage ≥ Defense, **stun** it (send to owner’s discard pile).
- **Attack a Player**: Reduce their Health by Combat spent.
- **Guards (black shield)**:
  - While a player has a prepared Guard, they and their non-Guard Champions **cannot be targeted**.
  - Must stun all Guards before attacking player or non-Guard Champions.

> Champions with Expend abilities that grant Combat do **not attack directly** — Combat goes to your pool.

#### Stun
- A Champion is stunned when:
  - Damage taken in one turn ≥ its Defense.
  - An effect explicitly says “Stun target champion.”
- Stunned Champion goes to owner’s discard pile.
- Champions **prepare at end of their owner’s turn**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

- **Health** is the score. Starts at 50.
- A player is **eliminated** when Health ≤ 0.
- **Victory**:
  - **Free-for-All**: Last player standing wins.
  - **Hunter - First Blood**: First player eliminated → player to their right wins.
  - **Hunter - Last One Standing**: Continue after eliminations; teammate to eliminated gains 10 Health and draws 1 card. Last player standing wins.
  - **Hydra (2v2)**: Teams share Health (start at 75). Last team with surviving player(s) wins.
  - **Emperor (3v3)**: Emperors have 60 Health, Commanders 50. Defeating Emperor ends game.
  - **Solo Modes**: Defeat the Boss/Demon. Lose if your Health ≤ 0 or Boss reaches 100 Health.
