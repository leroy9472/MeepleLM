### 1. Lore & Objective

Combat Commander is a card-driven, squad-level wargame set during World War II in Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific. Players take control of opposing forces (e.g., Axis vs. Allies) and use a hand of Fate cards to activate units and perform actions. The objective is to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) by the end of the game through three primary means:

- Eliminating enemy units
- Voluntarily exiting friendly units off the enemy’s map edge
- Controlling map objectives

The game ends when one of the following occurs:
- A player must place an eliminated unit on their Surrender marker
- A player’s last unit on the map is eliminated
- A player’s last unit voluntarily exits the map
- A successful Sudden Death roll is triggered

In case of a tie in VPs, the player holding the Initiative card wins.

### 3. Setup

1. **Choose a Scenario**:
   - Determine forces, map, starting positions, and special rules.
   - Example: In "The Ardennes," both sides receive mid-game mortar reinforcements.

2. **Prepare the Board**:
   - Place Track Display, Time marker, Sudden Death marker, VP marker, and Year marker as specified.
   - Place Objective chits (open or secret) as directed.
   - Mark initial Objective control with control markers.

3. **Deploy Units**:
   - Players set up units according to scenario rules (e.g., Axis first, Allies last).
   - Follow stacking limits: maximum 7 soldier figures per hex.

4. **Prepare Decks**:
   - Shuffle Fate decks; each player draws to hand size based on Posture:
     - Attack: 6 cards
     - Recon: 5 cards
     - Defend: 4 cards
   - Place Objective and Smoke/Blaze chits in separate draw cups.

5. **Determine First Player**:
   - As specified in scenario (e.g., Allies first in "The Ardennes").

6. **Place Reinforcements**:
   - Units under Time Track spaces are set up when the Time marker advances to that space.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

1. **Active Player Phase**:
   - Play up to the number of Orders allowed by OB (Order Limit).
   - Each Order activates one unit or player (except Heroes, who may activate multiple times).
   - After each MP expenditure during a Move, the inactive player may respond with Actions.

2. **Order Execution**:
   - Orders include: Fire, Move, Advance, Recover, Rout, Artillery Request, Artillery Denied, Command Confusion.
   - Actions (e.g., Op Fire, Assault Fire) may be played by either player during any turn.

3. **Die Triggers**:
   - Any die roll may trigger: Event!, Jammed!, Sniper!, or Time!.
   - Triggers pause gameplay and resolve immediately (except non-Time triggers on last card, which resolve after Time Advance).

4. **End of Turn**:
   - Draw back to hand size.
   - If the last card is drawn, advance the Time marker.

5. **Time Marker Advance**:
   - Triggered by Time! roll or drawing last card.
   - Steps:
     1. Reshuffle draw and discard piles.
     2. Sudden Death roll (if Time ≥ Sudden Death space).
     3. Defender gains 1 VP.
     4. Remove one Smoke marker.
     5. Reinforcements enter play.
     6. Players may play "Dig In" Actions.

6. **Turn Rotation**:
   - Players alternate turns until game end.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Orders

- **Fire**:
  - Declare firing unit(s) and target in Range and LOS.
  - Ordnance requires Targeting Roll (multiply dice; must exceed range minus hindrance).
  - Fire Group: FP of one unit +1 per additional unit. Ordnance cannot join.
  - Attack Total = FP + Command + Elevation + Die Roll – Hindrance.
  - Defense Total = Morale + Command + Cover + Die Roll.
  - Result: Break if Attack > Defense; Suppress (or Break if moving) if equal.

- **Move**:
  - Activate unit; spend MPs to move.
  - Group movement: all units must start and end in same hex; limited by lowest MP.
  - +1 MP if unit enters a Road hex during move.
  - +1 MP to enter higher elevation.
  - 1 MP to exit enemy edge.
  - Transfer Weapon: 1 MP during move.

- **Advance**:
  - Move into adjacent hex ignoring MP and terrain cost.
  - Can enter enemy-occupied hex (triggers Melee).
  - Cannot be targeted by Op Fire.
  - Can exit enemy edge or cross Cliff (if no Weapon).

- **Recover**:
  - Player activates self.
  - Remove all Suppressed markers.
  - Rally Roll for each broken unit: Roll < Morale = Rally; = Morale = Suppress; > Morale = No effect.

- **Rout**:
  - Activate player (self or opponent).
  - Rout Roll for each broken unit: Roll < Morale = No effect; = Morale = Suppress; > Morale = Retreat by difference.
  - Retreating unit moves toward friendly edge, ignoring MP and Wire, but not Mines.
  - Eliminated if retreats off friendly edge, into enemy hex, impassable hex, or across Cliff.

- **Artillery Request**:
  - Choose Battery Access (fix broken Radio) or Fire for Effect.
  - Fire for Effect requires unbroken Radio and unbroken, unactivated Leader.
  - Steps:
    1. **Spotting**: Place SR in LOS of Leader.
    2. **Accuracy**: Targeting Roll (multiply dice). Hit: SR drifts 1 hex per die. Miss: SR drifts direction (white die) and distance (colored die).
    3. **Impact**: 7-hex area. Smoke: place random markers. Artillery: Attack Roll per hex using Radio FP. Fortification destroyed if roll equals Vulnerability number.

- **Artillery Denied**:
  - Break opponent’s Radio (eliminate if already broken).

- **Command Confusion**:
  - No effect. Dud card.

#### Actions

- **Opportunity Fire (Op Fire)**:
  - Inactive player plays Fire card during opponent’s Move.
  - One attack per MP expenditure.
  - Ordnance cannot be used.
  - Units activated for Op Fire remain active for entire Move Order.

- **Assault Fire**:
  - After Move activation, fire with units that have boxed FP as one attack.
  - Ordnance: only one may fire, must roll to hit first.

- **Sniper!**:
  - Reveal top card; check hex number.
  - Fix/Eliminate broken weapons in or adjacent to hex.
  - Then break one unit in or adjacent to hex.

- **Jammed!**:
  - All weapons currently firing become broken (does not reduce current attack).

- **Event!**:
  - Draw top card and execute event.

#### Line of Sight (LOS)

- Draw line between center dots of hexes.
- Obstacles (e.g., Wall, Blaze) block LOS.
- Hindrances (e.g., Smoke, Woods) reduce targeting rolls and FP.
- Smoke hinders LOS into, out of, and through hex.
- Units do not block LOS.

#### Stacking

- 7 soldier figures per hex.
- 1 Weapon, 1 Suppressed, 1 Veteran per unit.
- 1 Smoke, 1 Blaze, 1 Fortification per hex.
- Enforced at end of turn; overstacked units eliminated unless Deploy Event used.

#### Initiative

- Holder may cancel last die roll and re-roll, then pass card.
- Unlimited uses; not part of hand.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Victory Points

- **Elimination / Involuntary Exit**:
  - Squad: 2 VP
  - Team: 1 VP
  - Leader: 1 VP + Command
  - Hero: 0 VP

- **Voluntary Exit**:
  - Same VP values; unit placed on Time Track (can return as reinforcement).

- **Objectives**:
  - Open: VP awarded immediately when controlled.
  - Secret: VP awarded at game end.
  - VP values cumulative; changing control subtracts then adds VP.

#### Game End Conditions

1. Player places eliminated unit on Surrender marker → Loses.
2. Player’s last unit eliminated → Loses.
3. Player’s last unit voluntarily exits → Compare VPs; higher wins (tie to Initiative).
4. Sudden Death roll < Time marker space → Compare VPs; higher wins (tie to Initiative).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can a unit fire twice in one turn?**  
  No. Units may only fire once per turn, even if activated by different Orders or Actions.

- **Can Op Fire target a unit in a hex with other units?**  
  Yes. All units in the target hex must make Defense Rolls.

- **What happens if a Fire Attack reduces FP to 0 or less due to Hindrance?**  
  The attack cannot be made unless Actions increase FP to at least 1.

- **Can a broken unit be activated?**  
  Yes, for Orders or Actions, but it cannot fire Weapons.

- **Can a unit transfer a Weapon during Advance?**  
  No. Advance ignores MP, but Weapon transfer requires 1 MP.

- **Does Road bonus apply if unit only moves along Road hexside?**  
  No. Unit must enter a Road hex (not just cross Road hexside) to gain +1 Movement.

- **Can a unit in a Blaze hex be targeted?**  
  Yes, but LOS is blocked through Blaze hex.

- **What happens if a Melee hex has no enemy units at start of turn?**  
  Remove Melee marker. No Melee occurs.

- **Can a unit Retreat through Wire?**  
  Yes. Wire effects are ignored during Retreat.

- **Can a unit with a negative Movement modifier move?**  
  Yes, unless modified Movement is 0 or less and no Advance or Rout is used.
