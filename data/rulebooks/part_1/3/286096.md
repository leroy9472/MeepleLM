## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Tapestry*, players create unique civilizations from the dawn of humanity into the distant future. Through advancement in science, technology, exploration, and military, players build their income, expand their capital cities, and collect tapestry cards that narrate their civilization’s story. The objective is to earn the most victory points (VP) by the end of the game.

The game ends for each player after their 5th Income Turn. Once all players complete their 5th Income Turn, the player with the most VP wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most remaining resources wins.

### 5. Core Mechanics

  - Upgrade to gain circle (middle) or square (top) benefits.
  - Top row requires you or a neighbour to meet prerequisite.

- **Military**:
  - *Core Action: Conquer* – Place an Outpost on a territory adjacent to yours with ≤1 token.
  - Roll both Conquer Dice, choose one benefit.
  - If conquering an opponent, topple their Outpost (now controlled by you).
  - Opponent may play a **Trap Card** to prevent conquest (you still gain die benefit).
  - Outposts cannot be removed; max 2 per hex.
