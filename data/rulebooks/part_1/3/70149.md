## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Ora et Labora*, players take on the role of monastic leaders developing their cloister and surrounding countryside. The goal is to score the most victory points (VPs) through strategic building, resource management, and settlement placement. Victory points are earned from:  
- Goods (especially wine/whiskey, which are worth 1 VP each)  
- Building cards (each has a VP value)  
- Settlements (score based on their own "dwelling value" and adjacent buildings)  

The game ends after a trigger condition based on player count, followed by final actions and scoring.

### 2. Components  
- Game board (different sides for player counts and variants)  
- Production wheel (two sides: short game and standard/long)  
- Building cards (A–D tiers, starting buildings, cloister-specific)  
- Settlement cards (player-colored, with dwelling values)  
- Goods indicators (wood, clay, peat, grain, livestock, coin, wine/whiskey, grapes, stone, joker)  
- Clergymen: each player has 3 (1 prior, 2 lay brothers); solo uses a neutral player  
- Landscape tiles: districts (horizontal), plots (vertical), heartland (starting)  
- Resource cards: forest (wood), moor (peat)  
- Blue building marker (tracks settlement phases)  
- Starting player marker  

Note: Grapes and stone are only used in France variant; Ireland variant uses whiskey instead of wine.

### 3. Setup  
#### Board & Wheel  
- Choose board side based on player count:  
  - 1–2 players: use 1–2P side  
  - 3–4 players: use 3–4P side  
- Choose wheel side:  
  - Short games (3–4P): front (0,2,3,4...)  
  - All others (including solo, 2P long): back (0,1,2,2...) or front for 2P long  
- Place wheel with beam pointing to "Bible" icon.  
- Place blue building marker on space in front of "A" pile.

#### Cards & Supplies  
- Remove building cards not applicable:  
  - 3 players: remove "4" and "3+" cards  
  - 4 players: remove "4" cards  
- Choose country variant:  
  - France: use grapes/wine; remove malt/beer tiles  
  - Ireland: use whiskey; remove flour/bread and grapes/wine tiles  
- Sort building cards into face-up piles: Starting, A, B, C, D  
- Place one settlement card per player near each pile (A–D), and four at start  
- Place goods indicators on "A" space of wheel:  
  - Standard: wood, clay, peat, grain, livestock, coin, joker  
  - France: add grape indicator beside board  
  - Stone enters later (round 13)  
- Joker (orange square) can represent any good, even grapes/stone before they enter.

#### Player Setup  
Each player receives:  
- 1 heartland landscape  
- 3 clergymen (1 prior, 2 lay brothers)  
- 8 settlement cards (4 at start, 4 distributed during game)  
- 1 clay, 1 wood, 1 peat, 1 grain, 1 livestock, 1 coin  
- Landscape tiles sorted by cost (lowest on top)

For solo:  
- No starting goods  
- Landscape piles face down (most expensive first)  
- Neutral player uses Builder’s Market  
- Goal: 500 points  
- Use all buildings except Carpentry, Grapevines, and C-Quarry (France variant)

For 3–4P short:  
- Each player gets only 1 prior, 1 lay brother  
- Use 2P buildings (3P) or 3P buildings (4P)

For 2P long:  
- Use all buildings except Carpentry, C-Grapevine, C-Quarry (France)  
- Use front of wheel  
- Round structure differs (see below)

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this sequence:

1. **Retrieve Clergymen**  
   - If all your clergymen are placed, take them back.

2. **Rotate Production Wheel**  
   - Advance wheel one space counter-clockwise.  
   - Beam pushes goods indicator from space 10 forward.  
   - Reset that good’s indicator to 0.  
   - In France variant: after round 8, place grape indicator at 0.  
   - In round 13, stone enters game after beam passes stone symbol.

3. **Settlement Phase (if triggered)**  
   - Triggered when beam passes A, B, C, D, or E pile.  
   a. Move blue building marker to space in front of next pile (or E).  
   b. Each player may buy 1 landscape tile (once per phase).  
   c. Each player may build 1 settlement from their supply (pay food/energy cost).  
   d. Distribute 1 new settlement card to each player.  
   - Note: E phase occurs only at game end in 3–4P.

4. **Action Phase**  
   - Players take turns in clockwise order, each taking 1 action.  
   - Starting player takes one additional action.  
   - Actions (choose one per turn):  
     a. **Place a clergyman**  
     b. **Fell trees / Cut peat**  
     c. **Build a building**  
   - Free actions (anytime):  
     - Buy 1 landscape tile (once per round and once per settlement phase)  
     - Convert grain → straw  
     - Exchange: $5 ↔ 5×$1, wine → $1, whiskey → $2  

5. **Pass Starting Player Marker**  
   - Pass to next player clockwise.

#### Player Count Variations  
- **3–4 players**: Each player 1 action, starting player gets extra  
- **2 players (standard)**: Active player takes 2 actions, then other player takes 2 actions per round; rotate wheel each turn  
- **2 players (long)**: Starting player takes 2 actions, other player 1 action per round; round-based  
- **Solo**: Take 2 actions per round; neutral player builds under specific conditions

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### A. Place a Clergyman  
- Place on your own unoccupied building to use its function.  
- May place without using function.  
- Use another player’s clergyman:  
  - Pay $1 ($2 after winery/distillery built), or discard 1 wine (France) / 1 whiskey (Ireland)  
  - Owner chooses which clergyman to send (if available)  
  - Cannot refuse  
- If prior is available, may immediately use a newly built building  
- Clergymen remain in diocese until bonus round  

#### B. Fell Trees / Cut Peat  
- Remove a forest card → gain wood; remove moor card → gain peat  
- Amount determined by production wheel  
- Reset wood/peat indicator to 0  
- Can be done even with no cards left or indicator at 0 (gain nothing)  
- Does not use a clergyman  

#### C. Build a Building  
- Pay resource cost (wood, clay, straw, stone, coin)  
- Place on empty landscape space  
- Restrictions:  
  - Cloister buildings: must be orthogonally adjacent to another cloister building  
  - Coast/Hillside: some buildings require these terrains  
  - Mountain: only Quarry or Castle  
  - Water: only Houseboat (Ireland)  
- Districts must be placed flush above/below heartland or other districts  
- Coastal plots: left of heartland; Mountain plots: right  
- Cost number must be in lower-right corner  
- After placement, add forest/moor cards to matching spaces  

#### D. Landscape Purchase  
- Once per round and once per settlement phase  
- Districts: expand vertically  
- Plots: coastal (left), mountain (right)  
- Adjacency rules:  
  - Coastal: at least 1 coast space adjacent to existing coast  
  - Mountain: at least 1 hillside space adjacent to existing hillside  

#### E. Goods Production & Joker  
- When producing any good (via building, tree/peat action), move that good’s marker to 0  
- Joker can be used to collect any good, even grapes/stone before they enter  
- Joker valid for production buildings, tree felling, peat cutting  

#### F. Special Rules by Player Count  
- **3–4P Short**:  
  - All players gain 1 of the produced good immediately  
  - Each round, all players gain goods shown on wheel (those passed by beam)  
- **2P Long**:  
  - Use front of wheel  
  - Active player: 2 actions; other: 1 action  
  - Game ends when ≤3 buildings left in open display  
- **Solo**:  
  - Landscape tiles face down  
  - Neutral player gains buildings during settlement phases (or via variant)  
  - If wheel pushes marker at 10, it is removed from game  

#### G. Neutral Player (Solo)  
- No forests/moors of its own  
- Builder’s Market in top-left corner  
- Pay $ to general supply to use its clergyman  
- At start of each settlement phase: all unbuilt buildings go to its heartland  
- Can rebuild over unoccupied buildings (cloister over cloister only)  
- Ignore terrain requirements  
- May pay to place neutral’s prior on new building immediately  
- If all 3 of its men are used, it takes them back

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Triggers  
- **3–4 players**: When beam passes "E" space on wheel  
  - Proceed to bonus round:  
    a. All players retrieve priors  
    b. Each player takes 1 final action:  
       - Build a building and use prior, OR  
       - Place prior on any building (occupied or opponent’s, no cost)  
    c. Resolve 5th (E) settlement phase  
    d. Final scoring  
- **2 players (standard)**: When D buildings are available and ≤1 building left in open display  
  - Active player finishes turn  
  - Rotate wheel  
  - Other player takes 1 final action  
  - No bonus round or E settlement  
- **2P long**: When D buildings are available and ≤3 buildings left  
  - Finish current round  
  - Score immediately  
- **Solo**: Same as 2P standard, but goal is 500 points  

#### Scoring  
Total VPs from:  
1. **Goods**:  
   - Each coin, wine, whiskey, relic, etc. worth 1 VP  
   - Note: wine = 1 VP + $1; whiskey = 1 VP + $2  
2. **Buildings**: Sum of VP values on all built cards  
3. **Settlements**:  
   - Each settlement scores:  
     - Its own dwelling value (red shield)  
     - Plus dwelling values of orthogonally adjacent buildings  
   - Water spaces have dwelling value 3 even if unoccupied  
   - Negative dwelling values count if adjacent  

Example: Shanty Town (–3) adjacent to buildings with values 2, 2, 6 → total = –3 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 7 VP  

Highest score wins. Tie = all win.
