## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Calico*, players compete to create the coziest quilt by placing colorful and patterned patch tiles onto their personal quilt board. The goal is to attract cats by forming pattern-based groups, sew buttons by creating color groups, and fulfill design goals. The player with the most points from cats, buttons, and completed design goals wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most cat tokens wins; if still tied, the one with more button tokens wins; otherwise, the victory is shared.

### 2. Components  
- 4 Dual-layer Quilt Boards  
- 108 Patch Tiles (6 colors × 3 patterns × 6 each; 6 sets of 18)  
- 24 Design Goal Tiles (6 per player)  
- 6 Black + White Patch Tiles  
- 5 Double-sided Cat Scoring Tiles (each with 2 cats)  
- 80 Cat Tokens (matching scoring tiles)  
- 1 Cloth Tile Bag  
- 1 Score Pad  
- 52 Button Tokens (8 of each color, 4 rainbow)  
- 1 Button Scoring Tile  
- 1 Master Quilter Tile (winner badge)

### 3. Setup  
**Standard Setup:**  
1. **Select Cat Scoring Tiles**:  
   - Group cat tiles by dot count (•, ••, •••).  
   - Randomly select one tile from each group and randomly choose which side to use.  
   - Place selected tiles in the center and place matching Cat Tokens nearby.  
2. **Assign Black & White Tiles**:  
   - Randomly assign 2 of the 6 Black + White Patch Tiles to each Cat Scoring Tile.  
3. **Prepare Patch Tiles**:  
   - Shuffle all patch tiles and place in stacks or the bag.  
4. **Place Button Components**:  
   - Place Button Scoring Tile and Button Tokens in the center.  
5. **Distribute Player Materials**:  
   - Each player gets a Quilt Board and their 6 matching-color Design Goal Tiles.  
   - Shuffle the 6 tiles, reveal 4, choose 3 to place on the board’s goal hexes. Return unused tiles.  
6. **Draw Initial Tiles**:  
   - Each player draws 2 Patch Tiles into their hand.  
7. **Form Market**:  
   - Reveal 3 Patch Tiles to form the market.  
8. **First Player**:  
   - The player who most recently pet a cat goes first.

**Beginner Setup (Simplified):**  
- Use only Millie, Tibbit, and Coconut Cat Scoring Tiles.  
- Assign 2 Black + White tiles to each.  
- Each player places ≠, AA-BB-CC, and AAA-BBB Design Goal Tiles.  
- All other rules as standard.

**Variants:**  
- **Family Variant**: Flip Design Goal Tiles face down; they act as obstacles but are not scored.  
- **2-Player Lower Variance**: Remove one full set of 36 patch tiles (one of each color-pattern combo) before setup.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise until all quilt boards are full (22 turns). Each turn has two steps:

1. **Place a Patch Tile**  
   - Choose one of the two tiles in your hand and place it on any empty space of your quilt board.  
   - After placement, check for:  
     - **Cat Tokens**: Form a group of matching pattern in the required size/shape per active Cat Scoring Tile.  
     - **Button Tokens**: Form a group of 3+ tiles of the same color (any shape).  
   - Place the appropriate token(s) on a tile within the group.

2. **Draw from Market**  
   - Choose one of the three face-up market tiles and add it to your hand.  
   - Refill the market by drawing a new tile from the bag/stack.

**Rules for Token Placement:**  
- A new group of the same color or pattern must not touch a previously scored group to earn another token.  
- Partial hexes along board borders count toward group formation.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Cat Scoring  
Each Cat Scoring Tile specifies:  
- Two preferred patterns  
- Required group size or shape (e.g., 3+, 4+, or specific shape)  
To attract a cat:  
- Create a group using one of the preferred patterns  
- Group must meet size or shape requirement  
- Place matching Cat Token on any tile in the group  
- Groups must be non-adjacent to prior scored groups of the same type  

**Example Cats:**  
- Millie: 3+ of same pattern  
- Tibbit: 4+ of same pattern  
- Callie: Specific shape (rotatable) of same pattern  

#### Button Scoring  
- Form a group of 3+ tiles of the same color (any shape).  
- Earn one Button Token of that color.  
- Groups must be isolated from prior same-color groups to earn additional buttons.  
- **Rainbow Button**: Earn one if you have at least one button of each of the 6 colors. Place it on any tile.  

#### Design Goal Tiles  
Each tile has a requirement based on the 6 surrounding tiles:  
- Must satisfy condition using **colors**, **patterns**, or **both**  
- **Score Blue Value**: Completed with color OR pattern  
- **Score Yellow Value**: Completed with color AND pattern (only the higher value counts)  

**Common Goal Types:**  
- ≠: All 6 different colors or patterns  
- AA-BB-CC: Three different pairs (color or pattern)  
- AAA-BBB: One triplet and one pair (color or pattern)  
- 4+2: Four of one and a pair of another  
- 3+3: Two different triplets  
- 2+2+2: Three different pairs  
- 2+2+1+1: Two pairs and two singles  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends when all players fill their quilt boards.

**Final Scoring:**  
1. **Cats**:  
   - Score points shown on each Cat Scoring Tile for every Cat Token on your board.  
2. **Buttons**:  
   - Each Button Token (including Rainbow) is worth **3 points**.  
   - *Exception*: If using the Button Tile Ring (see below), scoring changes.  
3. **Design Goals**:  
   - Score blue value if completed with color OR pattern.  
   - Score yellow value if completed with both.  
   - Only the higher value counts per tile.  

**Winning**:  
- Highest total score wins.  
- Tiebreakers:  
  1. Most Cat Tokens  
  2. Most Button Tokens  
  3. Shared victory  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a tile not adjacent to others?**  
  Yes. No adjacency requirement unless using Rule Restriction variant.  
- **Do partial border hexes count in groups?**  
  Yes, for both cat and button groups.  
- **Can I score multiple cats from overlapping groups?**  
  Only if each meets a different cat’s requirement and is non-overlapping with its own prior group.  
- **Can I score a cat and a button from the same tile placement?**  
  Yes, if both conditions are met.  
- **What if I run out of Cat Tokens?**  
  Use the token from the back of the Cat Scoring Tile; it’s worth the same points.  
- **Can I place a button on a Black + White tile?**  
  No. Black + White tiles do not contribute to color groups for buttons.  
- **Can I place a cat on a Black + White tile?**  
  Yes, if it’s part of a valid pattern group.
