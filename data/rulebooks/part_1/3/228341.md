## PULSAR 2849 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
PULSAR 2849 is a sci-fi strategy game set in a distant future where players compete as space-faring corporations harnessing energy from pulsars. The goal is to score the most victory points (VP) over 8 rounds through exploration, technological advancement, and infrastructure development.

### 2. Components
- Star Cluster Board (main game board, two sides)
- Dice Board (with tracks for initiative and engineering)
- 7–9 silver dice (depending on player count), 1 red die
- Median Marker (yellow)
- Player pieces: rockets (2 per player, 3 in 2-player), 6 pulsar claim rings, player tokens
- 100 VP tile per player
- Engineering cubes
- Die Modifier Board with ±1 and +2 tokens
- Gyrodyne Board with Gyrodyne tiles (types 1, 2, 3) and Construction Award tiles (7 VP and 4 VP)
- Technology Boards (I, II, III; one of each used per game)
- Transmitter Tiles (A, B, C stacks)
- Planetary System Tiles (16, face-down)
- Exploration Bonus Tiles
- Goal Tiles (6 total, 3 used per game)
- Headquarters (HQ) Boards (1 per player, optional)
- Time Marker
- Score Track

### 3. Setup
1. Place Star Cluster Board in center; choose side (recommended: no dead-ends for first game).
2. Shuffle and place 16 Planetary System Tiles face-down on their locations.
3. Place Dice Board with correct side up (based on player count: 2/3p or 4p).
4. Roll silver dice: 7 for 2/3 players, 9 for 4 players. Place on Dice Board by value. Leave red die in black hole.
5. Place median marker:
   - Find median die value.
   - Place marker on that space.
   - Cover that space and count dice on left/right; move marker one space toward side with more dice. If equal, leave in place.
6. Deal 3 Transmitter Tiles face-up (from randomized A/B/C stacks, A on top).
7. Randomly select and place one Technology Board each from categories I, II, III around the board.
8. Place Time Marker pointing to innermost (first) tech row.
9. Place Exploration Bonus Tiles in face-down stack.
10. Shuffle 3 random Goal Tiles and place beside board.
11. Each player takes:
   - 2 rockets (3 in 2p), 6 pulsar rings, 100 VP tile
   - 1 ±1 die modifier token
   - 1 random HQ Board (choose side before game starts)
   - Player tokens and engineering cubes
12. Randomly assign turn order:
   - Place one rocket per player on Dice Board's turn order track.
   - Place player tokens on Initiative and Engineering tracks in reverse order (last player on top).
   - Score Track: 1st–4th players start at 5–8 VP respectively.
13. In reverse turn order, each player places second rocket on unoccupied entry gate.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the 8 rounds proceeds in three phases:

#### Dice Phase
1. First player rolls all silver dice and places them on the Dice Board by value.
2. Determine median:
   - Place yellow marker on median die’s space.
   - Cover that space; move marker one space left or right based on which side has more dice.
3. Draft dice:
   - In turn order, each player selects one die.
   - Then in reverse order, each selects a second die.
4. For each die taken:
   - Move either Initiative or Engineering marker in the direction the die is from the median.
   - Number of spaces moved = number of die spaces between die and median.
   - Markers on top of a stack are ahead.
   - Cannot move a marker off the right end unless no valid option exists; then place on farthest right space, bottom of stack.
   - If moving off left end, place on leftmost space.

#### Action Phase
1. Players take turns in Initiative Track order.
2. Each player uses their 2 dice (and optionally 1 bonus die) to perform actions.
3. Each die can be modified by one modifier token (±1 or +2); final value may exceed 6 or be below 1.
4. Actions:
   - **Fly Survey Ship**: Spend 1 die to move exact number of segments. Cannot reuse segments in one action (except dead-end doubles). Flip face-down planetary systems passed through. Place station per rules.
   - **Buy Die Modifier**: Spend 1 or 2 die for ±1; spend 2 die for +2.
   - **Take Gyrodyne Tile**: Spend 1 (small), 2 (medium), or 4 (large) die to take tile. Place in play area.
   - **Flip Gyrodyne Tile**: Spend 3 (small), 5 (medium), or 6 (large) die to flip tile at pulsar (completes construction).
   - **Patent Technology**: Spend die matching cost icon. Only available technologies (at or inside Time Marker) can be patented. One per player per tech (or one per round if lock icon).
   - **Build Transmitter Array**: Spend die matching any die on a transmitter. Cover cost with token. Link to existing array or start new. Pay all costs to flip and gain benefits.
   - **Turn Transmitter Online**: Pay remaining costs on incomplete transmitters. Flip and gain immediate benefits. Linked flipped transmitters grant red bonus die.
   - **Work on HQ Project**: Spend indicated die to complete project. Must complete lower projects first. Gate Run projects provide future VP.
   - **Develop Pulsar (Free Action)**: At any time, place a Gyrodyne tile (face-down) on one of your claimed pulsars.
   - **Copy Leftover Die**: Spend 4 engineering cubes to use red die at value of any leftover die on board. Only one bonus die per turn.

#### Production Phase
1. **Set Turn Order**: Rearrange rockets on Dice Board by Initiative Track position (leftmost first; top of stack ahead).
2. **Gain Engineering Cubes**:
   - 2p: 1st = 2 cubes, 2nd = 1 cube, 3rd = 1 VP
   - 3–4p: 1st = 3 cubes, 2nd = 2 cubes
3. **Penalties**: Lose 1 or 2 VP if marker is on -1 or -2 space (Initiative or Engineering). Minimum score 0.
4. **Online Transmitters**: Gain immediate and ongoing benefits (VP, cubes, abilities).
5. **Score Spinning Gyrodynes**: Each produces VP = value on tile + value from current round’s tech row. If “+?” = median marker value (if between spaces, use higher).
6. **Score Green Technologies**: Technologies with double-arrow icon score VP now.
7. **Set Up Next Round** (skip in round 8):
   - Discard unclaimed Transmitters; reveal 3 new.
   - Slide tech tokens down if on upper space (freeing for reuse).
   - Move Time Marker to next tech row.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Median System**: Determines die selection bias and movement direction.
- **Snake Draft**: Ensures balanced die access.
- **Track Movement**: Initiative affects turn order; Engineering affects cube income.
- **Gyrodyne Construction**:
   - Take tile (action), place on pulsar (free), flip (action).
   - First to 2 same-sized spinning gyrodynes: 7 VP; second: 4 VP.
- **Transmitter Linking**: Linked pairs grant red bonus die when both flipped.
- **HQ Projects**: Gate Runs score VP per matching gate visited in future flight.
- **Bonus Die**: Can be obtained via leftover die, linked transmitters, or technologies. Must be used immediately.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after round 8. Final scoring:
1. **Purple Technologies**: End-game bonuses.
2. **Goal Tiles**: Score base VP if goal achieved. May spend cubes to buy first bonus, then second.
3. **Unfinished Pulsars**: 1 VP per pulsar ring without spinning Gyrodyne.
4. **Unfinished Gyrodynes**: 1 VP per Gyrodyne tile not flipped (in play or on board).
5. **Engineering Cubes**: 1 VP per pair.
6. **Initiative Track**: 1st = 7 VP, 2nd = 4 VP, 3rd = 2 VP (3p: no 3rd place VP).
7. **Planetary Stations**: Score based on total number:
   - 2–13 stations: 2,4,6,9,12,16,20,25,30,36,42,50 VP
   - 14+ stations: +3 VP per station beyond 13
- **Tiebreaker**: Highest position on Initiative Track.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use a die value >6?** Yes, for flying ship only.
- **Can I move a marker off the right end of a track?** Only if no other die allows valid move; then place on farthest right space, bottom of stack.
- **Can I claim a pulsar without flying to it?** Yes, via certain technologies or transmitters, but only isolated pulsars (no flight segments).
- **Can I win both Gyrodyne awards for the same size?** Yes, by placing 4 of same size before any other player has 2.
- **Can I use multiple bonus dice in one turn?** No, only one per turn.
- **Can I modify the red bonus die?** Yes, with one modifier token.
- **What if no die allows valid track move?** Choose any die; move either marker to farthest right space, bottom of stack.
