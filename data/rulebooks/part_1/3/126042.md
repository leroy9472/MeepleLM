## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Nations is a historical board game where players control civilizations from ancient times to the brink of World War I. The objective is to become the greatest nation by accumulating Victory Points (VP) through economic development, military strength, cultural achievements (Books), and monumental constructions. Players compete across four historical ages (Antiquity, Medieval, Renaissance, Industrial), each lasting two rounds. The game ends after round 8, and the player with the most VPs wins, with ties broken by player order.

3. Setup  
- Randomize player order. Place player disks on the Heritage Track (1st player on 1, etc.) and Player Order Track.  
- Each player selects a difficulty level (Chieftain, Prince, King, Emperor), affecting bonus resources during Growth.  
- Shuffle Progress Card decks by age. Use only Age I deck initially; place others aside. Optionally remove Advanced/Expert cards for beginners.  
- Fill Progress Board: For 2 players, use 4 columns; 3 players, 5 columns; 4 players, 6 columns; 5 players, 7 columns. Draw cards from current age deck to fill all spaces.  
- Each player chooses a Player Board (using A-side recommended for beginners). For B-sides, randomize available boards and select in reverse player order, optionally choosing A-side.  
- Each player places starting resources and workers as shown on their board. Place 0 on Military and Stability tracks.  
- Place War marker on War space.  
- Refill Architects: Place 1 (2p), 2 (3-4p), or 3 (5p) architects on the Architects space. Add architects shown on Event Card (drawn later).  
- Place round marker on "A" (Antiquity).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows three phases:  
1. **Maintenance Phase**  
2. **Action Phase** (players take turns in order until all pass)  
3. **Resolution Phase**  
Repeat for 8 rounds. After rounds 2, 4, 6, and 8, perform End-of-Age Scoring.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Maintenance Phase**  
  1. **Round Marker**: Advance round marker. Skip in round 1.  
  2. **Progress Cards**: Remove cards from rows 1 and 2. Move row 3 cards to row 1 (left-aligned). Refill empty spaces with cards from current age deck.  
  3. **Growth**: In reverse player order, each player chooses:  
     - Take 1 worker from Population Track (must either reduce Stability by 3 immediately or pay 3 Food during Production each round), or  
     - Take bonus resources: Food, Stone, or Gold equal to difficulty level (Chieftain: 4, Prince: 3, King: 2, Emperor: 1). Cannot mix resources.  
  4. **New Events**: Draw 1 Event Card from current age and place face-up on Score Board.  
  5. **Architects**: Remove unused architects from previous round. Place new architects based on player count and Event Card.  

- **Action Phase** (in player order; repeat until all pass)  
  A. **Buy Progress Card**: Pay Gold based on row (3/2/1). Resolve:  
     - Place on Player Board (Buildings/Military, Colonies, Advisors, Wonders) if space available; replace old card if needed.  
     - Remove after use (Battles, Golden Ages).  
     - Place on War space (Wars); only one War per round.  
  B. **Deploy Worker**: Place 1 worker on Building/Military card; pay Stone cost. Worker from Resource Area or another Building/Military. Multiple workers allowed per card; only 1 per turn.  
  C. **Hire Architect**: Take architect from Architects space, place on leftmost free section of Wonder Under Construction, pay Stone cost.  
  D. **Special Action**: Use action from card on your board (e.g., Advisor, Wonder).  
  F. **Undeploy Workers**: Freely move workers back to Resource Area at any time during your turn (free action).  

- **Resolution Phase**  
  1. **Production**: Calculate net production/consumption in order: Gold, Food, Stone, Books.  
     - Multiply by number of workers on each Building/Military.  
     - Nations in Revolt (negative Stability) lose 1 Book per negative point and 1 VP.  
     - Shortage: For each missing Food/Stone/Gold, lose 1 Book. For each resource type short, lose 1 VP (max 1 VP per type per round).  
     - If Books at 0 and must lose more, lose 1 VP and 1 other resource per Book.  
  2. **Player Order**: Determine next round order by Military Strength (highest first). Tiebreaker: Stability, then previous order.  
  3. **War**: Nations with Military Strength below War marker are defeated. Lose VP (1) and resources shown on War card. Resource loss reduced by Stability (VP loss not reduced).  
  4. **Events**: Resolve top event, then bottom.  
     - Benefits: No one gains if tied for highest.  
     - Penalties: All tied for lowest suffer fully.  
     - All nations with negative Stability are tied for lowest.  
     - Choices resolved in reverse player order.  
  5. **Famine**: Pay Food shown on Event Card. Shortage handled as in Production.  
  6. **End-of-Age Scoring** (after rounds 2, 4, 6, 8): Each nation gains 1 VP for each nation with fewer accumulated Books.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Final Scoring** (after round 8):  
  A. **Game VP**: Sum VP tokens.  
  B. **Colonies**: Add VP from Colonies.  
  C. **Wonders**: Add VP from Wonders (including special bonuses).  
  D. **Buildings & Military**: For each worker on Building/Military, score VP left to right. Excess workers beyond VP symbols score nothing.  
  E. **Resources**: Sum Gold, Food, Stone, Books, Military Strength, Stability. Divide by 10 (round down) for VP.  
- Total all categories. Highest VP wins. Tiebreaker: Player order.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Ties**: For positive effects (e.g., events), no one benefits if tied. For negative effects, all tied suffer. All nations with negative Stability are tied for lowest.  
- **Resource Loss**: Max 1 VP lost per resource type per round. Cannot go below 0 VP.  
- **Worker Limits**: Population Track holds max 4 workers per section (Food/Stability). If forced to return worker with no space, place on top; take first next growth.  
- **Card Removal**: "Remove" means return to box. Conditions for removal are checked continuously.  
- **Deploying Workers**: Cannot deploy from Population Track. Undeploying is free and can be done anytime during turn.  
- **5-Player Rules**: For positive effects, "strongest" means top two (if tied, both get benefit; if three+ tied, none). For negative effects, "weakest" means bottom two.  
- **Golden Age Bonus**: Reduces VP cost or increases resource gain. Multiple bonuses add up. Minimum VP cost is 0.  
- **Raid Value**: Used for Battles. Based on best Military card with at least one worker. Multiple workers on a card do not increase Raid value.  
- **Stability**: Reduces War losses, permits population growth, affects Events. Does not reduce Event losses.  
- **Military Strength**: Affects War, Events, Colonies, player order. Does not produce during Resolution Phase.
