## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Legendary: Marvel*, players take on the roles of heroes working semi-cooperatively to build their decks, defeat villains, rescue bystanders, and ultimately defeat the Mastermind four times to claim victory. The game ends when the Mastermind is defeated for the fourth time, the villain deck or hero deck runs out, or the Mastermind completes their evil scheme. The player with the most Victory Points (VP) wins if the Mastermind is defeated or the scheme is survived; otherwise, all players lose if the Mastermind’s “Evil Wins” condition is met.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, perform the following three steps in order:

Resolve based on card type:

- **Villain**:
  1. Place face-up in the leftmost city space (Sewers).
  2. Shift existing villains rightward.
  3. If a villain is pushed off the Bridge, it **escapes**:
     - Current player KOs a Hero from HQ costing 6 or less; refill HQ.
     - If the escaping villain had bystanders, each player discards 1 card.
     - Resolve any “Escape” effect on the villain.
  4. Resolve **Ambush** effect (if any), before recruiting/fighting.

- **Master Strike**:

  - Place Strike in KO pile.

#### Step 2: Play Cards to Recruit and Fight  
- Play cards from hand one at a time, gaining Recruit (★) and Attack (⚡).

- Draw a random Tactic card from under the Mastermind.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I fight the same Villain twice in one turn?** No. Once defeated, it’s removed.
- **Can I use a Superpower ability if I play the matching card after?** No. The matching card must be played **before** using the ability.
- **What if I can’t KO a HQ Hero on escape?** Do as much as possible. If no eligible Hero, skip.
- **Can I use Wound’s healing ability if I recruit a Hero?** No. Healing requires playing only Wounds and doing nothing else.
- **Do Artifacts count for Superpower triggers?** Only on the turn they are played.
- **Can I fight a Villain with Elusive if I generated ★ but didn’t spend it?** Yes. Generation matters, not spending.
- **What if the Villain Deck runs out during Uru-Enchanted Weapons reveal?** Shuffle revealed cards and continue revealing.
- **Can I use multiple Focus abilities in one turn?** Yes. Each use costs ★ as specified.
