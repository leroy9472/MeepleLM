## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
This is a solo variant of *Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game*, where the player faces off against an AI opponent (the "bot") representing either the Empire or the Rebellion. The objective is to destroy the opponent’s final base. The player chooses which faction the AI controls at the start of the game.

### 2. Components  
- Standard game components: player deck, AI deck, base cards, galaxy row, force track, resource counters, capital ships, attack/force/resource icons.  
- Three AI-controlled bases (16 HP each):  
  - Empire AI: Coruscant → Death Star → Endor  
  - Rebellion AI: Yavin 4 → Hoth → Sullust  
- Player-controlled bases: Lothal or Dantooine (starting), plus two chosen from their faction.  
- Galaxy row (6 slots), force track with neutral starting position.  
- Optional: extra die to track variable **X**.

### 3. Setup  
- Choose AI faction (Empire or Rebellion).  
- Place AI starting base in play (Coruscant for Empire, Yavin 4 for Rebellion).  
- Player places chosen starting base (Lothal or Dantooine).  
- Shuffle remaining two AI bases into a deck; same for player (final base must be 14 or 16 power).  
- Set force token to neutral on force track.  
- Build galaxy row per standard rules.  
- AI starts with standard 10-card deck, no hand.  
- **X = 0** (number of AI bases destroyed by player).  

> **Solo Rule (Galaxy Row Refresh):** If no AI faction cards are present in the galaxy row at any time, discard all cards and generate a new row.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Turns alternate: Player Turn → AI Turn.  

#### Player Turn  
- Play as per standard rules: play cards, gain resources/force/attack, purchase cards, attack, resolve end-of-turn effects.

#### AI Turn (Phased – No Going Back)  
**1. Set-Up Phase**  
- If AI base was destroyed, reveal next base from deck (reshuffle if needed; re-draw if final base not 14/16 power). Resolve base ability to maximize AI benefit.  
- Gain resources from capital ships and any force-side bonus.  
- Gain **X** additional resources (X = number of AI bases destroyed by player).

**2. Deployment Phase**  
- Draw 5 cards from AI deck and reveal them one at a time.  
- For each card:  
  - Gain resource/force/attack icons immediately.  
  - Resolve special ability if possible. Ability must be used upon play.  
  - If ability triggers a card draw, reveal one additional card and resolve it immediately.  
- Cards with "exile self" abilities (e.g., Outer Rim Pilot, Jawa Scavenger): use ability and exile after gaining benefits.  
- If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
- After all cards are played, phase ends.

**3. Purchase Phase**  
- Use accumulated resources to buy cards from galaxy row. Priorities:  
  1. **Final Base in Play (AI or player):** Only buy cards with attack icons.  
     - Try to buy Luke (Rebel AI) or Darth Vader (Empire AI).  
     - Else, buy most expensive capital ship with attack.  
     - Else, most expensive card with attack.  
     - Else, skip.  
  2. **Final Base Not in Play:**  
     - Try to buy Luke or Darth Vader (faction-based).  
     - Else, buy most expensive capital ship.  
     - Else, most expensive card.  
     - Else, buy as many Outer Rim Pilots as possible.  
     - Else, skip.  
- On ties: favor own faction, then closest to galaxy deck.  
- Resources not spent are lost.

**4. Sabotage/Bounty Hunt Phase**  
- AI **must** attempt to destroy **one** card in galaxy row if able.  
- Target: highest-cost enemy card that can be destroyed with available attack.  
- Cannot use capital ships for this.  
- If multiple cards tie in cost, target the one closest to the galaxy deck.  
- **Rewards (AI ignores printed rewards):**  
  - Deal **2 damage** to player’s base (soakable by capital ships).  
  - Move force token **1 space toward AI’s side**.  
- If no card can be destroyed, skip phase.

**5. Attack Base Phase**  
- Use remaining attack power (not used in Sabotage Phase) to attack.  
- If player has capital ships:  
  1. Destroy as many as possible, prioritizing most expensive.  
  2. If none can be destroyed, damage the one with least remaining health.  
- Any leftover damage is dealt to player’s base.

**6. Force Phase**  
- Move force token **X spaces** toward AI’s side (X = number of AI bases destroyed by player).

**7. Clean Up Phase**  
- Discard all AI units and unused resources.  
- Capital ships remain in play.  
- Discard top card of AI deck if forced to discard.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **X Value:** Starts at 0. Increases by 1 each time player destroys an AI base. Used for resource gain and force movement.  
- **AI Decision Priorities:**  
  - Attack > Force > Resource icons  
  - Card purchase: Attack cards first when final bases are active; otherwise, maximize value and deck strength  
  - Repair: always repair damaged base if ability exists  
  - Discard order: lowest resource → lowest force → lowest attack (unless final base is active — then never discard attack cards)  
  - Exile: always exile self-exiling cards after benefit; exile shuttles when required  
- **Card-Specific AI Rules:**  
  - **Moff Jerjerrod (AI):** Swap revealed card with highest-cost opposing faction card if revealed card is Empire and force favors Empire.  
  - **B-Wing (vs AI):**  
    - If AI has Shuttle: discard a card  
    - Else, if base won’t be destroyed: gain 2 attack  
    - Else: discard lowest resource/force/attack card  
  - **Jyn Erso (AI):** If force favors AI, player discards most expensive card (tie: highest total benefit; still tie: random).  
  - **Jabba’s Sail Barge (AI):** Add highest-cost bounty hunter from discard to hand.  
  - **Landing Craft (AI):**  
    - Choose resources only if it enables buying Darth Vader  
    - Else, repair base if damaged  
    - Else, take resources  
  - **Jawa Scavenger (AI):** Exile, then at start of Purchase Phase, buy most expensive card from galaxy discard pile (unless it blocks buying Luke/Vader).  
  - **Grand Moff Tarkin (AI):** Add highest-cost Empire card from hand to play (tie: closest to galaxy deck), exile it at end of turn.  
  - **Duros Spy (vs AI):** Choose “discard” if giving 1 force would give Rebels full force (+2) or AI already has full force (+3).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when **either player or AI destroys the opponent’s final base**.  
- The **first** to destroy the opponent’s final base **wins**.  
- No scoring — victory is binary.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: What if AI deck is empty during Deployment Phase?**  
  A: Shuffle discard pile to form new deck. Continue drawing.

- **Q: Can AI go back to a previous phase?**  
  A: No. Phases are sequential and irreversible.

- **Q: Does AI use base abilities?**  
  A: Yes. Resolve them in Set-Up Phase when base is revealed, choosing the option most beneficial to AI.

- **Q: What if AI cannot destroy any card in Sabotage Phase?**  
  A: Phase ends with no effect.

- **Q: How is X tracked?**  
  A: Count number of AI bases destroyed by player (0, 1, or 2). Used for resource gain and force movement.

- **Q: Can AI buy cards after Sabotage Phase?**  
  A: No. Purchase Phase comes before Sabotage; no purchases after.

- **Q: What if galaxy row has no AI faction cards?**  
  A: Discard entire row and generate a new one.
