### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Princes of Florence*, players assume the role of Renaissance-era Italian nobles competing to earn the most Prestige Points (PP) over seven rounds by supporting artists, scholars, and builders. The goal is to complete high-value Works, construct impressive Buildings, and fulfill Prestige card conditions. The player with the most Prestige Points at the end of the game wins; in case of a tie, the wealthiest player wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the 7 rounds consists of three phases:

#### Auction Phase
1. **Starting player** begins by bidding 200 Florin (300 in 2-player) on any auction item.
2. Players bid clockwise in increments of 100 or pass.
3. The last remaining bidder wins, pays the bank, takes the item, and places their Pawn on the stack.
4. The next eligible player (leftmost who hasn’t won) starts a new auction.
5. The last player may take any remaining item for 200 Florin.
6. Ends when all players have acquired an item or passed.

#### Action Phase
Players take turns clockwise, each performing **up to 2 actions**:
1. **Complete a Work** (up to 2 times)
2. **Build a Building** (up to 2 times)
3. **Take a Profession card** (once)
4. **Introduce a Freedom** (once)
5. **Acquire a Bonus card** (up to 2 times)

#### Round End
1. **Best Work**: Player(s) with the highest Work Value (WV) this round earn 3 PP.
2. All Pawns are returned.
3. Round marker advances.
4. Starting Player marker passes left.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Work Value (WV) Calculation
When completing a Work (playing a Profession card), WV is calculated as:
- **+4** if the preferred Building is in your Principality
- **+3** if the preferred Landscape is present
- **+3** if the preferred Freedom is introduced
- **+2** per Jester in your Principality
- **+1** per Profession or Recruiting card in hand or on table
- **+X** per played Bonus card
- **Minimum WV** increases per round (7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17)

#### Building Placement Rules
- Must fit entirely within the grid.
- Cannot overlap other pieces.
- Cannot be adjacent to another Building or Palazzo **unless** you have 2 or 3 Builders.
- May be adjacent to Landscapes.
- Each Building type may be built only once per Principality.
- Cannot be moved or demolished once placed.

#### Builders
- **1st Builder**: Buildings cost 300 Florin (instead of 700)
- **2nd Builder**: Buildings may be built adjacent to each other
- **3rd Builder**: Buildings cost 0 Florin
- Earn 3 PP when acquiring the 2nd and 3rd Builders

#### Bonus Cards
Each Bonus card provides a one-time WV boost when completing a Work. Examples:
- Each Building in Principality: +1 WV
- Each large Building: +2 WV
- Each Jester and Freedom: +1 WV
- Each Profession card in hand (excluding just played): +1 WV
- Each of your Profession cards on table (including just played): +1 WV

#### Recruiting Cards
- Acquired during Auction phase.
- Can be used at any time to swap with an opponent’s face-up Profession card.
- Does not count as an action.
- Counts as a Profession card for all purposes.

#### Prestige Cards
- Acquired during Auction phase (draw 5, choose 1, return 4 to bottom).
- Scored at game end if conditions are met.
- Some award full points for sole majority, half for a tie (shown in parentheses).
- Examples:
  - Most Buildings: 6 (3) PP
  - At least two large Buildings: 5 PP
  - Fewest empty spaces: 8 (4) PP
  - All three Landscape types: 8 PP

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends after Round 7.
- Players score PP from:
  - **Prestige cards** (if conditions met)
  - **Best Work each round** (3 PP for highest WV)
  - **Landscapes**: 3 PP for each duplicate (2nd+ of same type)
  - **Builders**: 3 PP for 2nd and 3rd Builders
  - **Buildings**: 3 PP per Building built
- **Final scoring**: Total PP determines winner.
- **Tiebreaker**: Most money.
- **Fame track**: Passing space 50 grants a 50/100 disk; at game end, add 50 or 100 PP based on disk value.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I go below 0 Prestige?** No. You cannot move backward on the Fame track if it would result in negative PP.
- **Can I use a Bonus card more than once?** No. Played Bonus cards are removed from the game.
- **Can I build a Building adjacent to my Palazzo?** Only if you have 2 or 3 Builders.
- **Do I score 3 PP for the 2nd and 3rd Builders if I acquire them out of order?** Yes, regardless of order.
- **Can I complete a Work with no Profession card?** Only with the **Princess** Character card (expansion).
- **Can I earn money by moving backward during a Work?** Yes, at any time, 100 Florin per PP lost.
- **Can I use a Recruiting card immediately?** Yes, during or after the Auction phase.
- **Palazzo**: Does not count as a Building for scoring or bonuses.
