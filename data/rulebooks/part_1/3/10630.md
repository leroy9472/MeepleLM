## 2. Components

  - Infantry: 4 figures per standard unit
  - Armor: 3 figures per standard unit
  - Artillery: 2 figures per standard unit
- 60 Command Cards (section and tactic cards)
- 8 attack dice (symbols: Infantry, Armor, Grenade, Star, Flag)
- 22 summary cards (terrain and unit reference)
- 4 cardholder sections
- 6 double-sided bunker and bridge tiles
- 14 special forces badges
- 6 activation tokens (double-sided: Move/Attack)
- Scenario booklet
- Rules booklet

## 3. Setup
1. Choose a scenario and set up the board with terrain, fixed obstacles (bunkers, bridges), and movable obstacles (hedgehogs, wire, sandbags) as specified.
2. Place unit figures according to scenario deployment:
   - Standard Infantry: 4 figures
   - Standard Armor: 3 figures
   - Standard Artillery: 2 figures
   - Special units may vary (e.g., French Resistance: 3 figures)
3. Place summary cards for relevant terrain types next to the board.
4. Assemble cardholders and place them on the board edges.
5. Choose sides (Allied or Axis).
6. Shuffle the Command Card deck and deal cards per scenario (e.g., Pegasus Bridge: Allies get 6, Axis get 2).
7. Place the remaining deck face-down as the draw pile.
8. Each player takes 4 attack dice.
9. Starting player (as per scenario) begins.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn follows this sequence:
1. **Play a Command Card**: Reveal one card from your hand.
2. **Order Units**: Announce which units you are ordering, based on the card’s section and unit limits.
3. **Move Units**: Move ordered units one at a time. Complete all movement before attacking.
4. **Battle**: Resolve attacks one ordered unit at a time. Each unit may attack once per turn.
5. **Draw a Command Card**: Discard the played card and draw a replacement. If the deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Unit Movement
- **Infantry**: Move 1 hex and battle, OR move 2 hexes and do not battle.
- **Armor**: Move up to 3 hexes and battle.
- **Artillery**: Move 1 hex OR battle (not both).
- **Special Forces (e.g., Rangers, Commandos)**: Move 2 hexes and battle.
- **French Resistance**: Move 1 hex and battle, OR move 2 and do not battle; may retreat 1–3 hexes per flag.
- **Elite Armor**: Starts with 4 figures.

### Combat
- **Close Assault**: Attack an adjacent enemy. Required if adjacent.
- **Fire**: Attack an enemy 2+ hexes away.
- **Attack Dice by Unit and Range**:
  - *Infantry*: 3 dice at 1 hex, 2 at 2 hexes, 1 at 3 hexes.
  - *Armor*: 3 dice at 1–3 hexes.
  - *Artillery*: 3/3/2/2/1/1 at ranges 1–6 hexes.

### Line of Sight (LOS)
- Required for Infantry and Armor; Artillery ignores LOS.
- Draw line from center of attacker’s hex to center of target’s hex.
- LOS blocked if line crosses:
  - Units (friendly or enemy)
  - Blocking terrain: Forests, Hills, Towns/Villages, Hedgerows, Bunkers
- LOS not blocked by terrain in attacker’s or target’s hex.
- If line runs along hex edges, blocked only if obstructions exist on both sides.

### Terrain and Obstacle Effects
| Terrain/Obstacle | Movement | Battle | Protection | LOS | Special |
|------------------|--------|--------|-----------|-----|--------|
| **Forest** | Stop on entry | No battle on entry | Inf: -1, Arm: -2 | Blocks | — |
| **Hedgerow** | Stop on entry; must start adjacent to enter | No battle on entry | Inf: -1, Arm: -2 | Blocks | Exit adjacent only |
| **Hill** | No restriction | No restriction | -1 if attacking from lower | Blocks (except same height) | — |
| **Town/Village** | Stop on entry | No battle on entry; Arm: -2 when attacking | Inf: -1, Arm: -2 | Blocks | — |
| **Wire** | Stop on entry | Inf: -1 when attacking; may remove wire instead | None | No block | Armor removes wire when entering |
| **Sandbags** | No restriction | No restriction | Inf/Arm: -1 | No block | Ignore 1 flag; removed when unit leaves |
| **Bunker** | Impassable to Armor/Artillery | No restriction | Inf: -1, Arm: -2 | Blocks | Infantry only; ignore 1 flag; original owner only |
| **Hedgehog** | Impassable to Armor/Artillery | No restriction | None | No block | Infantry ignore 1 flag |
| **Beach** | Max 2 hexes of movement | No restriction | None | No block | Taking Ground and Overrun allowed |
| **Ocean** | Max 1 hex; no retreat into | No battle | None | No block | — |
| **River** | Impassable except via bridge | No restriction | None | No block | — |

### Resolving Attacks
- Roll dice based on unit, range, and terrain.
- **Hit**: One per matching symbol (Infantry, Armor, Grenade). Grenade hits all types.
- **Miss**: Star (unless modified by card).
- **Retreat**: Flag forces retreat toward baseline. Terrain ignored for retreat path.
  - If retreat impossible, remove 1 figure per uncompleted retreat.
  - Units in Bunker, Hedgehog, or Sandbags may ignore 1st flag.
- Artillery in bunker: Remove 1 figure per additional flag after first.

### Taking Ground & Armor Overrun
- **Taking Ground**: After successful Close Assault (eliminate or force retreat), Infantry and Armor may move into vacated hex.
  - Cannot take ground if movement restrictions prevent it (e.g., wire, forest).
- **Armor Overrun**: After taking ground, Armor may attack again (same turn).
  - Must Close Assault if adjacent enemy; may Fire otherwise.
  - Only one Overrun per turn.
  - Both attacks must be completed before next unit attacks.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Medals**:
  - 1 medal per eliminated enemy unit (place last figure on medal stand).
  - Additional medals for capturing objective hexes (per scenario).
- **Win Condition**: First player to reach scenario’s required medal count wins.
- **Tiebreaker**: Play until one player leads by at least one medal.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a unit attack after moving into a forest?** No. Must stop and cannot attack.
- **Can Armor move 3 hexes onto a beach?** No. Max 2 hexes of movement when first entering beach.
- **Does terrain in the target hex block LOS?** No. Only terrain along the line between centers matters.
- **Can a unit retreat through a forest or wire?** Yes. Retreat ignores terrain restrictions.
- **Can a unit split or combine?** No. Units must stay together; remnants cannot merge.
- **Can Artillery take ground?** No. Artillery cannot take ground or overrun.
- **Can a unit battle if it moved 2 hexes?** Standard Infantry cannot; Special Forces and Armor can.
