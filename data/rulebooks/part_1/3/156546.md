## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Monikers is a party game designed to be easy to learn yet engaging for intelligent players. The objective is for teams to score points by correctly guessing names from a shared deck of cards through clue-giving across three progressively restrictive rounds. The team with the highest total score after three rounds wins.

2. Components  
- A deck of name cards (typically 40–50 used per game)  
- Writing materials for scorekeeping  

Note: The physical components are player-printed or purchased; each card features a single name or public figure.

3. Setup  
- Divide players into two teams.  
- Deal 8 cards face down to each player.  
- Each player selects 5 of their 8 cards that they like and places them into a central pile.  
- Shuffle all selected cards into one shared deck; return unselected cards to storage.  
  - For large groups (>10 players), adjust initial deal and selection to maintain ~40–50 cards in play.  
- Determine starting team:  
  - Choose based on best story about meeting someone famous, or randomly.  
- Place scorekeeping materials nearby.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Starting team selects a clue-giver for their first turn.  
2. Clue-giver has 60 seconds to get teammates to guess as many names as possible from the shared deck.  
   - For large groups (>10), reduce time to 30–45 seconds.  
   - No limit on number of guesses per card.  
   - Skipping a card is allowed and encouraged.  
3. After a correct guess, the team keeps the card for scoring.  
4. Skipped cards are returned to the deck and reshuffled after the turn.  
5. Turns alternate between teams.  
6. Each player must take one turn as clue-giver before any player repeats.  
   - Play proceeds in clockwise order or by agreed system.  
7. A round ends when all cards in the deck have been guessed correctly.  
8. Score points from kept cards. Record total.  
9. Reshuffle all cards (guessed and skipped) into a new deck.  
10. The team with the lower score starts the next round.  
11. Repeat for three rounds with increasing clue restrictions.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Clue-Giving by Round:**  
  - **Round 1:** Any words, sounds, or gestures allowed.  
    - Cannot say any part of the name or the printed clue text on the card.  
    - If name or clue text is spoken, the card must be skipped that turn.  
  - **Round 2:** Only one word may be used (repetition allowed).  
    - No gestures or sounds.  
    - Word cannot be any part of the name.  
  - **Round 3:** Charades only.  
    - No spoken words.  
    - Sound effects (e.g., animal noises, engine sounds) are permitted.  
- **Turn Structure:**  
  - One player gives clues per turn.  
  - Timer starts; clue-giver attempts to prompt guesses.  
  - Teammates shout guesses.  
  - Correct guess: card awarded to team.  
  - Incorrect guess or pass: continue with same card.  
  - Skip: place card aside; it returns to deck after turn.  
- **Card Management:**  
  - Correctly guessed cards retained for scoring.  
  - Skipped cards reshuffled into deck after each turn.  
  - Deck reused across all three rounds.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- At end of each round:  
  - Count one point per correctly guessed card.  
  - Record team totals.  
  - Reshuffle entire card pool for next round.  
- After Round 3:  
  - Add up all points across three rounds.  
  - Team with highest total wins.  
- Optional: Play without scorekeeping for casual enjoyment.

  → Yes. All cards are reshuffled after each round.  
- **Must clue-givers go in strict rotation?**  
  → Each player must give clues once per round before anyone repeats. Order can be flexible as long as this rule holds.
