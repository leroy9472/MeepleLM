# War of the Ring — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *War of the Ring*, one player controls the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, striving to guide the Fellowship to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. The other player controls the Shadow, seeking to corrupt the Ring-bearer or achieve military dominance. The game combines strategic warfare with the hidden movement and corruption mechanics of the Fellowship.

**Victory Conditions:**
- **Free Peoples Win** if:
  - The Fellowship reaches the Crack of Doom and the Ring-bearers have less than 12 Corruption.
  - The Free Peoples control Shadow-controlled settlements worth 4 or more Victory Points (VP): Cities = 1 VP, Strongholds = 2 VP.
- **Shadow Wins** if:
  - The Ring-bearers accumulate 12 or more Corruption.
  - The Shadow controls Free Peoples settlements worth 10 or more Victory Points.

If both players meet military victory conditions, the Shadow wins.
