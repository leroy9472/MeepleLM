3. Select Dice (turn order)  
4. Plan Actions (simultaneous)  
5. Serve Guests (turn order)

5. Core Mechanics  
- **New Evening**: Move Round Marker; collect bonuses (e.g., Counter Guest, die, card, or free upgrade in Round 8). If marker passes Schnapps icon, all take 1 Schnapps.  
- **Guests Arrive**: Draw cards until all Tables are full.  
   - Guests → empty Table (left to right)  
   - Nobles → same Table (stacked)  
   - Tables → right of existing Tables  
   - Barbacks/Bards → right of Beer Storage  
   - Brewers → right of Brewer tile  
   - Dishwashers → left of Dishwasher tile  
   - Servers → left of Server tile  
   - For each Server, roll 1 colored die (max 3)  
- **Select Dice**:  
   a. All roll 4 white dice onto coasters  
   b. In turn order, each selects 1 die from their coaster  
   c. Pass coasters left; repeat until all have 4 white dice  
- **Plan Actions**: Place all dice (white and colored) on action spaces.  
   - "?" space: any die  
   - Specific pip value: die must match (Dishwashers allow +1)  
   - "1x" arrow: only 1 die  
   - "..." arrow: any number of dice  
   - Dishwasher effect: +1 to any die value (multiple usable on same die; 6 cannot become 1)  
   - Only top Noble activated if multiple at one table  
- **Serve Guests** (in turn order):  
   a. **Reputation Phase** (Module 3):  
      - Calculate Beer and Money production from dice placements only  
      - Advance Reputation marker by lower value; gain bonuses landed on  
   b. **Action Execution**:  
      - Remove dice to generate Money or Beer  
        - Guest/Noble: Money = value shown  
        - Cashbox: 1 Money (3 if upgraded)  
        - Brewer: 1 Beer per die (1 extra per Brewer card; 2 if upgraded)  
        - Barrel: 1 Beer (2 if upgraded)  
        - Barback: 1 Beer each  
      - Move Monastery marker: 1 space per die value 5 on Monk  
      - Advance Reputation: 1 space per Bard  
   c. Spend Money:  
      - Buy Tavern Cards (max 1 type per turn)  
      - Upgrade Tavern tile: pay cost; reduce by returning matching cards (min cost 0); gain 1 Noble per upgrade  
   d. Spend Beer:  
      - Recruit 1 Guest per turn (pay cost; take Signature Tile; place in Guestbook column by cost)  
      - Recruit Nobles: 1 for 9, 2 for 14, 3 for 18 Beers  
      - If Guest row has empty spot, refill from deck and add Signature Tile  
   e. Use Counter Guest: discard to either restart Guest phase or advance 1 space on Monastery  
   f. Use Schnapps (Module 2):  
      - 1 Schnapps → 2 Money  
      - 2 Schnapps → 3 Beers  
      - 5 Schnapps → free upgrade + Noble  
      - 2 Schnapps → remove 1 Guest (no die on it)  
      - 1 Schnapps → rotate 1 die to any side (before placement)  
      - 1 Schnapps → place 1 card on deck instead of discard (once per turn)  
   g. Complete Guestbook row/column → gain 1 Noble  
   h. Place Signature from Reputation → any column  
- **Closing Time**:  
   - Discard all played cards to face-up discard pile  
   - Discard excess Schnapps beyond 4  
   - Store excess Money/Beer in Safe/Beer Storage (max 5 if upgraded)  
   - If final round, game ends; else pass Beer Mug clockwise
