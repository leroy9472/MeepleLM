### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Red Cathedral*, players take on the roles of competing architectural teams building St. Basil's Cathedral (also known as the Red Cathedral) under Tsar Ivan the Terrible. The cathedral is constructed section by section, with players vying for influence, resources, and prestige. The goal is to earn the most Prestige Points by the end of the game through construction, decoration, and strategic dominance over the cathedral’s towers.

### 2. Components
- **Main Market Board**: Features an 8-section wheel with resource tiles and dice movement.
- **Cathedral Construction Site**: Composed of 3–6 towers (columns), each with Base, Middle, and Dome cards.
- **Player Boards**: Two sides (Basic and Advanced), each with workshop spaces, inventory, and ornamentation slots.
- **Player Pieces**:
  - 6 Banners (used to claim sections)
  - 4 Ornamentation tiles (1 Door, 2 Arches, 1 Cross)
  - Score marker
- **Resources**:
  - Materials: Lumber, Brick, Stone, Gold, Green Gems, Purple Gems
  - Rubles (currency)
  - Recognition Points (used for scoring and penalties)
- **Dice**: 5 colored dice (one per player color) + 1 White die
- **Tiles & Cards**:
  - Resource tiles (placed on market)
  - Influence cards (one per guild/clergy quadrant)
  - Workshop tiles (assigned to cathedral sections)
  - Building Plan cards (determine tower heights)
  - Cathedral cards (Base, Middle, Dome types)

### 3. Setup
1. Place the Market Board in the center.
2. Each player selects a color and:
   - Places 4 Banners in the Inventory; 2 outside (Basic) or in white Workshop spaces (Advanced).
   - Places Ornamentations (Door, Arches, Cross) on matching board spaces.
   - Sets score marker on "2" of the Scoring Track.
3. Randomly place one Resource tile face-up in each of the 8 Market sections.
4. Draw one Influence card from each of the four groups (Craftsmen’s, Teamsters’, Merchants’ Guilds, Clergy) and place one per quadrant.
5. Distribute dice clockwise starting from the section showing the "+" (Recognition) icon. Max 3 dice per section.
6. Shuffle Building Plan cards for player count; draw one to determine tower heights.
7. Shuffle Cathedral cards into three decks (Bases, Middles, Domes). Build towers according to the Building Plan.
8. Shuffle Workshop tiles; place one face-up on each Cathedral card. Remove tiles with "3+" icon if playing with fewer than 3 players.
9. First player chosen randomly; starting Rubles: 1st = 3, 2nd = 4, 3rd = 4, 4th = 5.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise. On a turn, a player must choose **one** of the following **main actions**, and may perform any number of **optional actions**:

#### Main Actions:
1. **Acquire Resources**
   - Choose one die and move it clockwise a number of spaces equal to its face value.
   - If it's your color die or the White die, pay 1 Ruble per additional space moved.
   - Cannot move into a section with 3 dice.
   - After movement, perform the following **in any order**:
     - **Collect Resources**: Take the resource shown on the tile × number of dice in that section (max ×3).
     - **Use Influence**: Use one action from the Influence card in that quadrant.
     - **Activate Workshop**: If you have a face-up Workshop tile matching the moved die’s color, activate its ability.
   - Roll all dice currently in the section where the die ended.

2. **Claim a Cathedral Section**
   - Place one of your Banners on the lowest unclaimed section in any tower.
   - Take the Workshop tile from that section and place it on your board:
     - **Face-down**: Free, no benefit.
     - **Face-up**: Pay listed cost, gain immediate bonus, and unlock ongoing activation ability.
   - Note: On Advanced board, Workshop tiles cost 3 Rubles; placing face-up unlocks Ornamentation.

3. **Build/Decorate the Cathedral**
   - Deliver up to 3 materials (from inventory) to:
     - **Build**: Add materials to your claimed (bannered), incomplete sections.
       - If all required materials are now present, complete the section:
         - Return materials to supply.
         - Gain Recognition and Rubles shown.
         - Flip card to completed side (keep Banner).
         - **Penalty**: For each completed section above an incomplete one in the same tower, the owner loses 1 Recognition per completed section above.
     - **Decorate**: Add Ornamentations to any completed section (yours or opponent’s):
       - Pay material cost (Door: Lumber, Arch: Stone, Cross: Gold).
       - Place Ornamentation tile (only one per section type).
       - Optionally add 1 or 2 jewels:
         - 1 jewel → +1 Prestige
         - 1 Green + 1 Purple jewel → +3 Prestige
       - Jewels must be added during decoration; cannot be added later.
   - You may combine building and decorating in one action, as long as total materials used ≤ 3.

#### Optional Actions (any time during your turn):
- **Lose 1 Prestige** → Gain 2 Rubles (unlimited uses).
- **Lose 1 Prestige** → Reroll all dice in one Market section (once per turn).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Resource Acquisition**: Driven by die movement and market interaction.
- **Workshop Activation**: Only possible when moving a die of the matching color (or white die for white Workshop tiles).
- **Inventory Management**: Limited by available spaces; expanded by removing Banners to claim sections.
- **Cathedral Construction**: Vertical progression; completing upper sections penalizes players with incomplete lower sections.
- **Ornamentation**: Adds endgame scoring and immediate Prestige; requires strategic placement and jewel use.
- **Advanced Board Rules**:
  - All Workshop tiles cost 3 Rubles to place face-up.
  - Ornamentations are locked until a Workshop tile is placed in their space.
  - White Workshop spaces blocked by Banners until Banner is used.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **End Game Trigger**: When any player completes their **6th Cathedral section**, they gain +3 Prestige. All other players take **one final turn**.
- **Final Scoring**:
  1. **Adjust Score Markers**: Move each player’s marker back to the nearest lower Prestige space.
  2. **Resource Conversion**: Gain 1 Prestige per 5 total Materials and Rubles (round down).
  3. **Tower Contribution Scoring** (per tower):
     - Calculate **Tower Prestige Value**:
       - 2 Prestige per completed section.
       - 1 Prestige per Ornamentation.
     - Count **contributions** (Banners + Ornamentations) per player in that tower.
     - Award points:
       - 1st place: Full tower value.
       - 2nd: Half of 1st (round down).
       - 3rd: Half of 2nd, etc.
     - **Tie Rule**: Sum points for tied positions, divide equally (round down).
     - **2-Player Rule**: 1st gets full value; 2nd gets 1/3 of 1st (round down). If tied, both get 0.
     - **Zero Contribution**: If a player has no Banner in the tower, they score 0.
- **Final Winner**: Player with most Prestige.
  - **Tiebreakers**:
    1. Most completed Cathedral sections.
    2. Most Ornamentations placed.
    3. Shared victory if still tied.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I discard resources to make space?**  
  No. If your Inventory is full, you cannot collect more than available space allows.

- **Can I build and decorate in the same action?**  
  Yes, as long as total materials used ≤ 3.

- **Can I decorate an opponent’s completed section?**  
  Yes. Any player can decorate any completed section.

- **Do Workshop benefits multiply with dice count?**  
  No. Activating a Workshop tile that gives a die’s resource gives only 1 unit, regardless of dice count.

- **Can I use a Workshop tile placed face-down?**  
  No. Only face-up tiles can be activated.

- **What happens when I complete a section with incomplete sections below?**  
  Each owner of an incomplete section below loses Recognition equal to the number of completed sections above it (excluding their own completed sections).

- **Can I place jewels later on a decorated section?**  
  No. Jewels must be placed during the decoration action.

- **Can I reroll dice even if I didn’t move a die?**  
  Yes. The optional action allows rerolling any one section’s dice once per turn.
