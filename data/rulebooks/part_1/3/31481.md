### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of:
1. **Building Phase**
2. **Preparation for Launch**
3. **Flight Phase**
4. **Journey’s End (Scoring & Cleanup)**

#### Building Phase
- **Start:** Boldest player (Round 1) or 1st-place finisher (Rounds 2–3) says "Go!" and places timer on circle equal to round number.
- **Grabbing Components:**
  - Use one hand only.
  - Component must be kept face-down until hovered over ship.
  - Place one at a time; previous placements are final once new component is touched.
  - Must connect orthogonally to existing ship via matching connectors (simple, double, universal).
  - Smooth sides only connect to other smooth sides.
  - Engines: exhaust must point rearward; no component directly behind.
  - Cannons: no component directly in front of barrel.
- **Set Aside:** Up to 2 components may be set aside. If not used, they become "lost components" (penalty).
- **Adventure Card Peek:** After placing at least one component, may look at one adventure pile at a time.
- **Timer Mechanics:**
  - When timer runs out, any player may flip it to next lower circle.
  - When timer runs out on circle 1, any finished player may flip to "Start."
  - When timer runs out on "Start," building ends. Unfinished players grab lowest-numbered tile.

#### Preparing for Launch
1. **Spot Check:** Remove components to fix illegal ship (e.g., wrong orientation, broken connections). These become "lost components" (penalty). If discovered during flight, also lose 1 credit.
2. **Positioning:** Player with Tile 1 places ship first. Others space ships round number of spaces apart.
3. **Crew Placement:**
   - Pilot cabin: 2 humans (cannot hold aliens).
   - Regular cabin: 2 humans or 1 matching alien (if adjacent to matching life support).
   - Multiple life supports: 2 humans or 1 of each matching alien.
   - Max: 1 alien per color.
4. **Batteries:** Place 2 or 3 batteries on each battery component.
5. **Adventure Deck:** Prepare 4th pile like others. Shuffle all 4 together. Shuffle until top card matches round number.

#### Flight Phase
- Leader reveals adventure cards one by one.
- Resolve in order:
  - **Open Space:** Announce engine strength; move forward that many empty spaces.
  - **Planets:** In order, land or pass. Load goods. Reverse order: lose flight days.
  - **Abandoned Ship/Station:** In order, choose to lose crew and take card or not. Lose flight days.
  - **Meteoric Storm:** Leader rolls 2 dice per meteor; determines row/column.
  - **Smuggler/Slaver/Pirates:** Compare cannon strength:
    - >: collect reward, lose flight days.
    - =: nothing; next player attacked.
    - <: pay penalty; next player attacked.
    - All defeated players roll 2 dice for cannon fire.
  - **Combat Zone:** Evaluate 3 lines. Weakest (or farthest ahead if tied) pays penalty. Roll dice for hit location.
  - **Stardust:** Reverse order; move back number of spaces equal to exposed connectors.
  - **Epidemic:** Remove 1 crew per occupied cabin connected to another cabin.
  - **Sabotage:** Smallest crew (or further ahead if tied) loses 1 component. Roll 2d6 for location (up to 3 attempts).
  - **Bonus Cards:**
    - **Space Billiards:** Choose row and opponent; opponent defends meteors.
    - **Junkyard:** Pay to gain reward (e.g., flight days, goods).
    - **Star Depot:** Replace components without discarding.

#### Giving Up
A player must give up if:
- All humans lost (finish current card first).
- No engine strength and encounter Open Space.
- Lapped by leader.
- Choose to give up.

**Consequences:**
- Remove marker; no further cards affect you.
- Forfeit finish order and exposed connector bonuses.
- Sell goods for half value (round up).
- Pay penalty for lost components.
- If last player, ignore Combat Zone and Sabotage.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Ties in Turn Order:** Leader acts first in most cases. For penalties (e.g., Combat Zone), leader suffers if tied.
- **Exposed Connectors:** Count non-adjacent connectors (i.e., not linked to another component).
- **Alien Bonuses:** Require at least one actual engine/cannon to activate.
- **Giving Up Mid-Card:** Allowed before next card is revealed.
- **Battery Use:** Can be used from any battery component; not required to be adjacent.
- **Component Destruction:** Remove hit component and any disconnected parts. Player chooses which half to keep if split.
- **Crew Loss:** Choose which crew to lose (aliens or humans).
- **Stasis Chamber:** Humans can be awakened only if at least one human remains awake.
- **Engine Booster:** Avoids current and next card. If used on final card, same as giving up.
- **Router Module:** Ensures all connected components are part of the same ship.
