## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Tichu is a 4-player partnership trick-taking shedding card game. The objective is to be the first team to reach 1000 points. Points are scored by capturing valuable cards in tricks, declaring and fulfilling Tichu (Grand or Small), or by having both teammates go out first and second.

2. **Components**  
- 56-card deck:  
  - 4 standard suits (e.g., Stars, Swords, etc.), 13 ranks each (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A)  
  - 4 special cards: Mah Jong, Dog, Phoenix, Dragon  
- Scoring: First team to 1000 points wins.

3. **Setup**  
- Players form two teams of two, seated diagonally opposite.  
- Deal 8 cards, then 6 more, so each player has 14 cards.  
- **Push (Schupf)**: Each player gives one card face-down to each of the other three players.  
- The player holding the **Mah Jong** leads the first trick.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
- Play proceeds counter-clockwise.  
- The lead player starts a trick by playing one of the legal combinations.  
- Each subsequent player may:  
  a) Play a higher combination of the same type and size, or  
  b) Pass.  
- Players who have played all their cards are "out" and must pass all remaining turns.  
- A trick ends when **three consecutive players pass**.  
- The last player to play wins the trick and leads the next one.  
- If that player is out, the next active player leads.  
- **Bombs** may be played at any time, even out of turn, to override the current trick.

5. **Core Mechanics**  

**Legal Combinations**  
- Single card  
- Pair (two cards of same rank)  
- Three of a kind  
- Full House (trio + pair; ranked by the trio)  
- Straight (5+ consecutive cards, any suits)  
- Consecutive Pairs (2+ pairs of adjacent ranks, e.g., 5-5, 6-6, 7-7)  

**Bombs** (override all regular combinations)  
- Four of a Kind (four cards of same rank)  
- Straight Flush (5+ consecutive cards of same suit)  
- **Bomb Ranking**: First by length (longer = stronger), then by card value (higher = stronger)  
- Cannot include special cards  
- Can be played at any time, even out of turn  
- A bomb beats all non-bomb combinations and weaker bombs  

**Special Cards**  
- **Mah Jong (0 pts)**:  
  - Holder leads first trick  
  - Can be played as a 1 (low) in a straight or as a single  
  - When played, may declare a "wish" for a specific rank (2–A); players must play that rank on their next legal turn  
  - Wish remains active until fulfilled or hand ends  
- **Dog (0 pts)**:  
  - Can only be played as a lead  
  - Immediately passes lead to partner; if partner is out, next player leads  
- **Phoenix (-25 pts)**:  
  - **As a single**: Value = previous card + 0.5 (minimum 1.5 if leading)  
    - Cannot beat the Dragon  
  - **In a combination**: Acts as a wild card (2 to A), but **cannot be used in bombs**  
- **Dragon (+25 pts)**:  
  - Highest single card (beats all others except bombs)  
  - Can only be played as a single  
  - **If Dragon wins a trick (not bombed)**: Winner gives the entire trick to an opponent of their choice  
  - Cannot be part of any combination or bomb  

**Tichu Declarations**  
- **Small Tichu**: Declared before playing first card  
  - Success (first out): +100 pts  
  - Failure: −100 pts  
- **Grand Tichu**: Declared before drawing 9th card (i.e., during initial 8-card hand)  
  - Success: +200 pts  
  - Failure: −200 pts  
- Only one Tichu declaration per player per hand  

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- **Hand Ends When**:  
  - Third player goes out: Hand ends immediately  
  - OR both teammates go out first and second: Hand ends immediately  
- **Scoring Cases**:  
  - **Normal End (not both teammates first and second)**:  
    - Last player adds their hand to opponents’ score pile  
    - All tricks go to the first player out  
    - Teams score points from cards in their combined score piles:  
      - 5: 5 pts  
      - 10, K: 10 pts each  
      - Dragon: +25 pts  
      - Phoenix: −25 pts  
      - Tichu results: ±100 or ±200  
  - **Team Sweep (teammates go out 1st and 2nd)**:  
    - Winning team gets **+200 pts**  
    - No card points are counted  
    - Second player out takes the final trick  
- **Game End**: First team to 1000+ points wins. If tied, play another hand.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Bomb Timing**:  
  - Players may pause to consider playing a bomb  
  - If multiple players want to bomb, the player next in turn order has priority  
  - Bombing is not based on reaction speed  
- **Wish Rules**:  
  - Phoenix cannot fulfill a Mah Jong wish  
  - If only way to play the wished card is via a bomb, player must play the bomb on their turn  
  - Out-of-turn bombs do not need to fulfill the wish  
- **Dragon & Bomb Interaction**:  
  - Bomb beats Dragon; trick is kept by bomb player (no transfer)  
  - If Dragon wins (not bombed), trick must be given to an opponent  
- **Dog Play**:  
  - Cannot be bombed; lead transfer happens immediately  
- **Mah Jong**:  
  - Does not have to be played first  
  - Wish can be made when played in a run  
  - Cannot wish for a special card
