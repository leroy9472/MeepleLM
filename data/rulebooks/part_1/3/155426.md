## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   Players are contractors building castles for the Mad King Ludwig, competing to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) by constructing rooms, completing room types, and fulfilling King's Favors. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.

2. **Components**  
   - 1 double-sided scoreboard (base game side used)  
   - 1 Master Builder Token  
   - 4 Foyer Tiles (color-matched)  
   - 6 Stairs Tiles  
   - 4 Player Swans (score markers)  
   - 24 King's Favors (tokens)  
   - 48 × 1000 Coins, 30 × 5000 Coins  
   - 9 Hallway Tiles (double-sided: upstairs/downstairs)  
   - Room Tiles by size:  
     - 9 each of: 100, 150, 200, 250, 300  
     - 6 each of: 350, 400, 450, 500, 600  
   - 50 Room Cards  
   - 27 Bonus Cards  
   - 4 Player Aids  

3. **Setup**  
   1. Place the scoreboard with the base game side up.  
   2. Shuffle the Bonus Card deck and place it face down.  
   3. Place all coins in a supply pile.  
   4. Shuffle King's Favor tokens face down; reveal 1 per player and place on the board. Return unused tokens to the box.  
   5. Shuffle Room Cards; create a deck of 11 cards per player. Return unused cards to the box.  
   6. Sort Room Tiles by size into face-down stacks on the scoreboard. Use only the number specified for player count.  
   7. Reveal Room Cards equal to the number of market spaces (5 for 2p, 6 for 3p, 7 for 4p). For each, place the top tile of the matching size under the market. Discard revealed cards.  
   8. Give each player:  
      - Foyer (choose entrance side before game)  
      - Player Swan  
      - Player Aid  
      - 15,000 Coins  
   9. Randomly choose the first Master Builder.  
   10. Master Builder places their swan on "0"; others place in clockwise order on "1", "2", etc.  
   11. Deal 3 Bonus Cards to each player; each keeps 2, returns 1 to the bottom of the deck.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   Each round consists of 5 steps:  
   1. **Draw New Rooms**: Master Builder reveals Room Cards for each empty market space, places matching Room Tiles. If a stack is depleted, draw another card. Refill only empty spaces allowed for player count.  
   2. **Price Rooms**: Master Builder rearranges all Room Tiles under the market (including carryovers), one tile per price. May move coins with tiles. Cannot place tiles under disallowed prices.  
   3. **Buy Rooms**: Starting left of Master Builder, each player in clockwise order:  
      - May buy any Room Tile at its set price, paying Master Builder (or supply if self-buying).  
      - May buy a Hallway or Stairs for 3000.  
      - Coins on tile may be used as part of payment; excess returned to buyer.  
      - May pass to gain 5000 coins.  
      - After purchase, place tile legally and score immediately.  
   4. **Add Coins**: Add 1000 coin to each unsold Room Tile.  
   5. **Pass Master Builder**: Token moves to next player clockwise. New round begins.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Room Placement Rules**:  
     1. At least one entrance must connect to an existing room.  
     2. Rooms may be rotated in 90° increments.  
     3. No overlapping tiles.  
     4. Must maintain at least one external entrance (open edge not fully enclosed).  
     5. Cannot place adjacent to fenced edge of Outdoor Room.  
     6. Downstairs Rooms connect only to dark end of Stairs, Downstairs Hallways, or other Downstairs Rooms.  
     7. Cannot buy a room that cannot be legally placed.  
   - **Room Scoring (immediate upon placement)**:  
     1. Score base VPs (top-left corner).  
     2. Apply bonus/penalty on new room (center icon).  
     3. Apply bonuses/penalties on connected rooms triggered by new room.  
     4. Apply adjacency penalties (e.g., Activity Rooms).  
     5. Apply Downstairs Room bonuses (if new room benefits them).  
     6. Complete Rooms: If placement completes one or more rooms (all entrances connected), gain completion rewards in any order.  
   - **Completion Rewards by Room Type**:  
     - **Activity Room**: Gain 5 VPs  
     - **Corridor (Foyer, Hallway, Stairs)**: Place 1 free Hallway or Stairs (once per turn)  
     - **Downstairs Room**: For every 2nd completed (2nd, 4th, etc.), choose any one of the other 7 rewards  
     - **Food Room**: Take 1 extra turn immediately  
     - **Living Room**: Re-score completed room (base + connection bonus)  
     - **Outdoor Room**: Gain 10,000 coins  
     - **Sleeping Room**: Look through one Room stack; place 0–2 tiles face down on top of Room deck. Shuffle rest back.  
     - **Utility Room**: Draw 2 Bonus Cards; keep 1, return 1 to bottom  
   - **Room Bonuses & Penalties**:  
     - **Connection Bonus**: Gain VPs per connected room of specified type.  
     - **Adjacency Penalty**: Lose VPs per adjacent room of specified type (any side touch).  
     - **Downstairs Bonus**: Gain VPs per room of type anywhere in castle.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - **Game End**: When last Room Card is drawn, finish the round. If market not full, reshuffle discard pile and draw to refill. After round ends, proceed to final scoring.  
   - **Final Scoring**:  
     1. **Depleted Stacks**: 2 VPs per room in castle matching a fully depleted tile stack (including Hallways and Stairs).  
     2. **King’s Favors**: Score based on rank:  
        - 1st: 8 VPs, 2nd: 4, 3rd: 2, 4th: 1  
        - Must have at least one qualifying item to score.  
        - Ties: Average points of tied ranks, rounded down.  
        - Favors: Small Rooms (100–300), Large Rooms (350–600), Square Rooms (100, 400), Round Rooms (150, 500), Completed Rooms, Incomplete Rooms (cannot coexist with Completed Rooms), External Entrances, Leftover Money, Room Type, Room Size.  
     3. **Bonus Cards**: Reveal and score individually (e.g., 8 VPs for all 10 room sizes, 7 VPs for all 8 types, etc.).  
     4. **Leftover Money**: 1 VP per 10,000 coins (rounded down).  
   - **Tiebreaker**:  
     1. Most total square footage in castle.  
     2. Most leftover money.  
     3. First tied player to grab Master Builder token.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Can I re-score a Living Room multiple times?** Yes, each time it is completed (e.g., via multiple connections).  
   - **Can Hallways be completed?** Technically yes, but unlikely due to many entrances.  
   - **Master Builder payment**: Pays to supply, not self. Can spend money earned earlier in round.  
   - **Sleeping Room in final round**: Chosen tiles go face up on discard pile (not drawn, but can deplete stack).  
   - **Room adjacency**: Full or partial side touch counts; corner-only does not.  
   - **Downstairs Rooms**: Cannot be placed until at least one Stairs tile is in castle.
