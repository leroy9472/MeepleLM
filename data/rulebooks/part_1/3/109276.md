### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Kanban: Automotive Revolution*, players are factory workers striving to impress Sandra, the factory manager, by efficiently managing production, innovation, and training. The goal is to score the most Productivity Points (PP) through actions like manufacturing cars, upgrading designs, attending meetings, and completing goals. Players compete in a lean manufacturing environment, balancing resource management, strategic planning, and timing.

### 2. Components
- Game board with five departments: Testing & Innovation, Assembly Line, Logistics, Design, Administration
- Human Resources (HR) and Recycling areas
- Player boards (Regular and Expert sides)
- Worker meeples (tall) and Certification meeples (short)
- Training track markers (discs)
- Car tokens (5 colors)
- Car part cubes (6 types: Chassis, Transmission, Turbo, Engine, Suspension, Brakes)
- Design tiles (with model and part upgrades)
- Kanban Order cards
- Performance Goal cards and Final Goal tiles
- Award Plaques
- Factory Goal tiles
- Demand tiles
- Shift Bank track and markers
- Certification Track
- Books of Knowledge, Parts Vouchers, and Red Seats
- Production Cycle, Week, and Pace markers
- Meeting token

### 3. Setup
1. Choose Sandra’s mood: **Nice Sandra** (start at 0 PP) or **Harsh Sandra** (start at 15 PP, cannot go below 0).
2. Choose difficulty: **Regular** (more benefits) or **Expert** (fewer benefits) per player.
3. Each player:
   - Selects a color and takes matching player board, meeples, and components.
   - Places Certification meeple on one of four spots in the 0 space of the Certification Track in HR, receiving the benefit shown.
4. In Certification Track order (right to left):
   - Each player takes one car part from Logistics and one design from Design (any location, no benefit).
5. Refill Design display: slide tiles right, then refill from top/bottom decks (use central deck if needed).
6. Set up board:
   - Place 3 different car parts in Recycling.
   - Place training manuals and parts vouchers on roof spaces.
   - Shuffle Award Plaques, place 3 face-down at top of each training track, top with Red Seat (2 plaques in 2–3 player games).
   - Place one of each car part type on the design track in Testing & Innovation.
   - Place Pace Car on checkered space, Meeting token in middle of test track, Production Cycle marker at 0.
   - In Assembly Line, place 2 cars of each color in their lines.
   - Shuffle and place 2 Demand tiles face up with indicated Red Seats.
   - Shuffle and place 6 car parts from a Kanban card into Logistics warehouses; return card to bottom of deck.
   - In Design, place 8 random face-up designs in rightmost spaces; make 3 face-up stacks of 9 from remaining tiles.
   - In Administration, place 4 face-up Performance Goal cards; shuffle rest into deck.
   - Place one Final Goal tile in meeting room.
   - Place player seats face down around table, one face up per player; lock certification seats.
   - Place Week marker at 0; Sandra at her desk.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round is a workday with two phases:
1. **Movement Phase**: Players and Sandra move to new workstations (left to right in Workstation Alley). Players cannot stay in the same department.
2. **Action Phase**: Players take actions in left-to-right order. Each workstation provides 1–3 shifts; banked shifts can be added (max 4 total per day).
3. **Sandra’s Turn**: Inspects department, awards or penalizes PP based on training and banked shifts, then performs department action.
4. **End of Week**: Triggered when Sandra is in Administration (after first round). End-of-week scoring occurs.
5. **Meeting**: Triggered when Pace Car reaches or crosses a checkered space. Held after end-of-week if both occur.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Training & Certification**: Spend shifts to advance on department training tracks. At level 3, become Certified: unlock board space, gain HR benefit, and advance on Certification Track.
- **Expert Status**: Reach top of training track. First to do so gains a Red Seat and chooses an Award Plaque (bank shift, 2 PP, book, or parts voucher).
- **Shift Bank**: Earn shifts from specific actions (e.g., Kanban order, certification). Use to work extra shifts (max 4/day). Banked shifts score 1 PP each at game end.
- **Recycling**: Free action to swap one car part for another (3 different parts always in Recycling).
- **Department Actions**:
  - **Design**: Take a design (1 shift), gain book or banked shift if from rightmost 4 spaces. Certified: access deck draws and 5th design space.
  - **Logistics**: Issue Kanban Order (1 shift, bank 1 shift): place card to stock warehouses. Collect parts (1 shift per warehouse). Certified: unlock 6th warehouse space and daily parts voucher action.
  - **Assembly Line**: Clean full assembly spaces. Provide parts (1 shift): add to line, advance car. Car rolls off: score 1–2 PP, place on test track (max 4 cars). In-demand model: gain a seat. Certified: unlock 5th garage (choose 2 benefits or 1 seat on Expert side).
  - **Testing & Innovation**: Claim car (1–3 shifts based on position): return matching design, place car in garage, gain benefit. Upgrade design (1 shift): spend part and design to increase part value, flip design, gain 2 PP. Certified: unlock double-upgrade ability (once per game, +2 value, score new value in PP).
  - **Administration**: Micro-manage (spend shifts as if in another department). Certified: unlock 5th meeting seat.
- **Meetings**: Triggered by Pace Car. Players speak in Certification Track order (right to left). Each player must play a “Pet Project” card. Use face-up seats to score on Performance Goal cards. Multiplier decreases with each use. After all pass, prepare next meeting: return used seats, flip new ones using Red Seats, each player submits one goal, draw two new cards, advance Production Cycle.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Daily Inspection**: Sandra inspects her department:
  - **Nice Sandra**: Top trainer(s) gain PP equal to banked shifts (if meet department requirement: e.g., 2+ upgraded designs).
  - **Harsh Sandra**: Bottom trainer(s) lose PP equal to (5 – banked shifts) if below requirement.
- **End-of-Week Scoring**: When Sandra is in Administration, for each car in garage:
  - 2 PP per upgrade you made to that model.
  - 1 PP per upgrade made by others.
- **Meeting Scoring**: Use seats to score on Performance Goals (e.g., 3 PP per certification, up to multiplier).
- **Final Scoring**:
  1. Move face-up meeting seats to player board.
  2. Spend 1 seat per Final Goal scored (e.g., 8 PP for 5 cars).
  3. 1 PP per banked shift, seat, book, parts voucher.
  4. PP per car in garage = value on wall in Testing & Innovation.
  5. For each Tested Design (upgraded part with matching car in garage), score PP = part value.
  6. Training track positions: 1st = 5 PP, 2nd = 3 PP, 3rd = 1 PP (stack order breaks ties).
- **End Game**: Triggered when:
  - Production Cycle marker is on space 3 and Week marker is on space 2, or
  - Week marker is on space 3 and Production Cycle marker is on space 2.
  Complete the round, including end-of-week and meeting, then final scoring.
- **Tiebreakers**: Most cars → most Tested Designs → most banked shifts → most certifications → all tied players win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Recycling**: Cannot be used during meetings. Must swap, not deposit only.
- **Garage Full**: Can replace a car, but do not gain benefit again.
- **Double Upgrade**: Only one per part type in game; counts as one upgrade for goals.
- **Benefits**: Books, vouchers, banked shifts cannot be used on the turn received.
- **Sandra’s Movement**: Moves right each turn; cycles back to left after Administration.
- **Demand Met**: Replace empty demand tile immediately, refill from deck.
- **Certification Order**: Rightmost on level gets earlier meeting speaking order.
