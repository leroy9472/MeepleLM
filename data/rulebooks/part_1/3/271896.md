3. **Place Contacts**: Mix contact tokens facedown. Place one facedown on each contact space, matching color and pip count to the space.
4. **Prepare Decks**: 
   - Separate market cards into 6 decks by back design; shuffle each; place facedown below map; reveal top card.
   - Separate encounter cards into 7 decks by location; shuffle each; place near corresponding locations.
   - Keep databank deck in numeric order (1-92+), never shuffled.
5. **Player Setup**:
   - Roll 6 dice; player with most hits and crits becomes first player.
   - Players choose characters clockwise, taking:
     - Character card (Personal Goal side up)
     - Player board (fame marker at 0)
     - 4 reputation tokens (neutral position)
     - Starter ship sheet (G9 Rigger or G-1A Starfighter)
     - Reference card
     - Character standee
   - Starting credits: 1p: 4k, 2p: 6k, 3p: 8k, 4p: 10k.
   - Draw specified databank card; place in cargo/job/bounty slot.
   - Place standee on starting planet listed on databank card.
   - Adjust reputation as specified on character card.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each player's turn consists of three sequential steps:

### Planning Step
Choose one:
- **Move**: Move up to ship's hyperdrive value. Stop if entering Maelstrom or space with patrol (unless positive reputation with that faction).
- **Recover**: Recover all damage from character and ship (required if defeated).
- **Gain Credits**: Gain 2,000 credits.
- **Planning Ability**: Resolve an ability starting with "Planning".

### Action Step
Perform any number of these actions (each only once):
- **Trade**: Exchange assets (bounties, cargo, crew, gear, jobs, mods) with another player in your space. Credits can be traded at any time.
- **Market**: If on a planet:
  1. Optionally discard top card of any market deck (place facedown on bottom).
  2. Buy top card of any market deck by paying cost. May barter cargo/gear/mods or current ship to reduce cost (minimum 0).
  3. After purchase, reveal new top card. If it has patrol movement icon, move that patrol toward you.
- **Deliver**: Discard cargo/bounty cards at destination to gain rewards. For illegal cargo, roll die: on hit (*), deliver; otherwise resolve databank #1.
- **Action Ability**: Resolve any ability starting with "Action".

### Encounter Step
Choose one:
- **Encounter Patrol**: Fight ship combat against patrol in your space (required if negative reputation with that patrol).
- **Encounter Space**: Draw encounter card matching your location and resolve appropriate section.
- **Encounter Contact**: Flip faceup a contact token on your planet; resolve corresponding databank card.
- **Encounter Ability**: Resolve ability starting with "Encounter".

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Skill Tests
Roll 2 dice. Success depends on skill level:
- **Unskilled** (no skill): Need at least 1 crit (※) to pass.
- **Skilled** (have skill once): Need at least 1 crit (※) or hit (※) to pass.
- **Highly Skilled** (have skill twice+): Need at least 1 crit (※), hit (※), or focus (※) to pass.

### Combat
Two types:
- **Ground Combat**: Use character's combat (※) and health (※).
- **Ship Combat**: Use ship's combat (※) and hull (※).

**Procedure**:
1. Attacker rolls dice = combat value. Each hit = 1 damage, crit = 2 damage.
2. Defender rolls same. Focus results deal no damage but may be used by card abilities.
3. Each suffers damage equal to opponent's rolled damage.
4. Winner is player who rolled most damage (attacker wins ties).

**Special Rules**:
- Fighting patrols is always ship combat.
- Fighting another player: ground combat on planet, ship combat otherwise.
- When fighting patrol/card, player to left controls defender.
- Level 4 patrols are invulnerable: always defeat player's ship, always win (no dice rolled).

### Reputation
Four factions (Rebel, Hutt, Syndicate, Imperial). Each player has reputation token per faction:
- **Positive (※)**: Ally benefits.
- **Neutral (※)**: No effect.
- **Negative (※)**: Enemy penalties.
Gain/lose reputation moves token one space. No effect beyond extremes.

### Defeated
When character damage ≥ health or ship damage ≥ hull:
1. Tip standee over.
2. Lose 3,000 credits.
3. Discard all secrets.
4. Finish current step but skip unstarted steps.
5. Next turn, must choose "Recover" in Planning Step to stand up.

### Bounties
- Fight contact matching your bounty card instead of resolving databank card.
- Combat type and value from bounty card.
- If win: eliminate (remove token, gain reward) or capture (place token on card).
- Captured bounties can be delivered to destination for capture reward.
- After gaining reward, remove bounty card from game.

### Jobs
- Attempt during Encounter Step at destination.
- Often requires resolving databank card with steps.
- If defeated during job, job fails (return databank card, keep job card).
- If completed, gain rewards, return databank card, discard/remove job card as instructed.

### Personal & Ship Goals
- Complete character's personal goal: gain 1 fame, flip card to gain new ability.
- Complete ship goal: gain 1 fame, flip ship sheet to gain new ability.
- Track progress with goal tokens.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- Gain fame through bounties, jobs, patrols, personal goals, ship goals, and other rewards.
- **Win Condition**: First player to reach 10 fame wins immediately.
- **Tiebreaker**: Among tied players, winner has:
  1. Most credits.
  2. If still tied, seated farthest clockwise from starting player.

**Extended Game Option**: Play to 12 fame instead.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Trading Ships**: When trading ship sheets, ships retain current side, damage, and goal tokens. Assets remain with original owners.
- **Secret Cards**: Keep facedown, do not take up slots. Can share information but cannot show card.
- **Discarding Assets**: When discarding crew/bounty with contact token, place token faceup on nearest empty contact space.
- **Multiple Same Actions**: Each action can be performed only once per Action Step, except Trade and Market which are limited to once each.
- **Patrol Movement**: After buying card, reveal new top card. If patrol movement icon, move that patrol toward buyer along shortest path.
- **Illegal Cargo Delivery**: Must be last action of turn. Roll die: hit (*) succeeds, else resolve databank #1 instead.
- **Defeated During Combat**: Resolve combat rewards before applying defeated effects.
- **Non-binding Agreements**: Future promises in trades are not binding.
