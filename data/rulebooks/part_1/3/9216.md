## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Goa*, players take on the roles of Portuguese merchants during the 16th-century spice trade era, competing to grow their commercial empires along the trade route from Portugal to India. The objective is to earn the most victory points (VP) by advancing on development tracks, founding colonies, collecting expedition cards, and achieving economic dominance. The game ends after 8 rounds (divided into two 4-round phases), and the player with the most VP wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most ducats wins.

### 2. Components

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. **Phase A setup**: Shuffle the 29 A-back tiles, reveal 4, and return them to the box (ensuring no more than 2 Plantation tiles are removed). Randomly place the remaining 25 on the board in a 5×5 grid.  
3. Place B-back tiles aside for Phase B.  
4. Place resource cards (ships, colonists, ducats, additional actions) and colony tiles on their designated spots on the board.  
5. Shuffle expedition cards and place face down.  
6. Place spice sacks in a supply.  
7. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
   - Supply board and development board  
   - Auction markers (5 with 4 players, 4 with 3, 3 with 2)  
   - 5 gray success markers (place one in the top row of each development column)  
   - Cards totaling 4 ships and 2 colonists  
8. Determine starting player: Youngest player draws expedition cards clockwise; first to reveal a card with an elephant (or tiger, per version) becomes starting player. That player takes the flag and 5–7 ducats (variant), others take 10 ducats.  
9. Oldest player becomes banker.  
10. (Optional) Place Bonanza tiles under corner spaces if using variant.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **8 rounds**, divided into **Part A (Rounds 1–4)** and **Part B (Rounds 5–8)**. After Round 4, remove A tiles and place 25 random B tiles on the board.  
Each round proceeds in four phases:

#### 1. Place Auction Markers  
- The player with the flag places it on an empty space in or adjacent to the 5×5 grid (must have at least one orthogonally adjacent tile).  
- They place their #1 auction marker on the flag.  
- Next player places #2 on a tile adjacent or diagonal to the previous marker.  
- Continue clockwise until all markers are placed (N+1 markers, where N = player count).  
- If a player cannot place adjacently, they may place on any empty tile, breaking the chain.  

#### 2. Tile Auctions  
- Auctions proceed in numerical order (1 to max).  
- **Flag auction first**: Owner (current starting player) bids 0. Each player, clockwise, may bid once or pass. Auctioneer has final bid/pass.  
- Highest bidder takes the tile and pays the bid to the auctioneer (or to bank if auctioneer wins).  
- Winner of the **flag tile** also takes 1 additional action card.  
- Other tiles: Winner takes tile and any immediate benefit.  
- Auctioneer retrieves their marker after each auction.  

#### 3. Player Actions  
Each player takes **3 actions**, starting with the flag holder and proceeding clockwise for each action round.  
Available actions:  
1. **Progress on Development Board**: Move one success marker down one row. Pay required spices and ships (1 ship per spice). Some expedition cards allow paying only ships, only spices, or ducats instead.  
2. **Build Ships**: Take number of ships shown in ship column.  
3. **Harvest**: Take number of spices shown in spice column; place on empty fields in plantations/colonies.  
4. **Taxes**: Take number of ducats shown in ducat column.  
5. **Expedition**: Draw number of expedition cards shown (left number). Player’s hand limit is the right number. May draw above limit only from tile effects.  
6. **Found Colony**:  
   - Name a colony not yet founded (Quilon: 6 colonists, Cochin: 8, Madras: 10, Calicut: 12).  
   - Total colonists from:  
     a. Colonist level on development board  
     b. Colonists shown on 2 drawn expedition cards  
     c. Colonist cards from hand  
   - If total meets requirement, place colony tile on supply board and fill with appropriate spices.  
   - If failed, draw 1 colonist card. Discard drawn expedition cards.  

**Expedition Cards**:  
- May play **one per action**, before, during, or after.  
- **Action-modifying cards** (marked "A") must be used with corresponding action.  
- **General cards** can be used anytime during action turn.  
- Playing a card is **not an action**.  
- May discard cards at any time.  

**Tile Use**:  
- Some tiles (e.g., Ship, Colonist, Spice, Ducats) can be used once per round (flip after use; reset next round).  
- Others (e.g., Espionage, Vice-King) are one-time use; discard after use.  
- **Duty tile**: Discard 6 spices to score 4–5 VP (depending on source). Flip face down; reveal at scoring.  
- **Swap tile**: Replace with any board tile; use immediately or later.  

#### 4. End of Round  
- Starting with flag holder, players take **additional actions** if they have additional action cards.  
- Each player may play **one card per turn**, take one action, or pass.  
- After passing, player cannot act again this round.  
- Players may keep **only one** additional action card; must play or discard excess.  
- Round ends when all players pass consecutively.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Auction Chain**: Strategic placement of markers influences bid order and access.  
- **Resource Triangle**: Spices and ships are required for development; development increases income of ships, spices, ducats, expeditions, and colonists.  
- **Colonist Acquisition**: Only via tile purchase or colony failure; used only for founding colonies.  
- **Expedition Cards**: Dual-purpose—immediate effect or endgame scoring by matching symbols (tiger, fish, palm, shell, statue).  
- **Tile Phasing**: B tiles (Part B) are generally more powerful than A tiles.  
- **Progress Bonuses**:  
  - First to reach **4th row** in a column: draw 1 expedition card.  
  - First to reach **5th row**: draw 1 expedition card.  
  - Any player with **all markers in 2nd row or lower**: draw 1 additional action card. Repeat for 3rd, 4th, 5th rows.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game
