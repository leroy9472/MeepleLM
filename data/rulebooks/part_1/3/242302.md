## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the role of Commodores managing space fleets, aiming to expand their influence by establishing colonies and upgrading ships. The goal is to be the first to reach 40 Victory Points (VP), triggering the final round. The player with the most VP after all players have taken an equal number of turns wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Command Console Board per player  
- 12 Starting Ship Cards per player (by color)  
- Ship Cards: 48 Level 1, 48 Level 2, 36 Level 3 (132 total)  
- 12 Colony Cards  
- Resource Cubes: Yellow (Money), Green (Income), Blue (VP)  
- Charge Cubes (Clear)  
- 2 Standard Dice (White, with rocket = 1)  
- Optional: Shy Plutonium Dice (Pink), Patrol Die (Green), Forecast Cubes (Orange), Upgrade Cards, Sector 13 Panel  

### 3. Setup  
#### Base Game Setup  
1. Each player receives a Command Console and 12 Starting Ship Cards. Place each card in its matching Sector (1–12) on the board.  
2. Place Yellow Money Marker on 5, Green Income and Blue VP Markers on 0.  
3. Shuffle Level 1, 2, and 3 Ship Decks separately. Reveal 6 cards from each to form the Shipyard (18 total).  
4. Lay out all 12 Colony Cards face-up in ascending sector order.  
5. Each player draws 1 random Level 1 Ship Card, pays its cost, and places it in the matching Sector.  
6. The current card in that Sector is Deployed: flipped 180° and tucked under the board so only the red (Passive) side is visible.  
7. The player who drew the highest Sector Card becomes the Starting Player (resolve ties with a die roll).  
8. Bonus Resources by Turn Order:  
   - 1st Player: Nothing  
   - 2nd Player: +1 Money  
   - 3rd Player: +2 Money  
   - 4th & 5th Players: +1 Income each  

#### Light-Speed Variant Setup (Alternative)  
- Start with 15 Money, 1 Income, 0 VP.  
- Draw 4 Level 1 and 2 Level 2 Ship Cards. Buy any number, return unused to bottom of decks.  
- Starting Player is the one with the most remaining Money (tiebreakers: highest Sector among purchased cards, then die roll).  
- Bonus Resources: same as Base Game.

#### High Player Count (6–7 Players)  
- All players begin with two Monitor-Relay Craft already Deployed in Sectors 7 and 8.

#### Optional Expansions  
- **Shy Plutonium**: Each player gets a Patrol Ship Token. Place 6 pink Plutonium Dice on the Shy Pluto board.  
- **Terra Proxima / Sector 13**: Add Sector 13 panel. Each player gets 4 Forecast Cubes (3 on Money slots, 1 on a die slot of choice). Reveal 3 Upgrade Cards.  
- **Biodome/Genesis**: Replace 6 standard Colony Cards with random ones from these sets (one per unique sector).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn (Active Player), follow these steps in order:

1. **Abilities May Be Used**  
   - Active Player: Use Blue or Green abilities.  
   - Passive Players: May use Red or Green abilities.  
   - Abilities that affect dice must be used *before* dice are rolled.

2. **Roll Dice**  
   - Active Player rolls 2 standard dice. Rockets count as 1.  
   - Optional: Use "Reroll" or "Set Dice" abilities before allocation.  
   - *With Shy Plutonium*: All players roll their Plutonium Dice (2–3 players) or only Passive Players do (4+ players).  
   - *With Terra Proxima*: Roll the Patrol Die. On a ship icon, place a Patrol Ship Token on the leftmost empty Shipyard card.

3. **Allocate Dice**  
   - Each player independently chooses:  
     - Activate two sectors using each die separately, OR  
     - Activate one sector using the sum.  
   - Doubles: May activate the same sector twice (if using dice separately).  
   - Players may use arrow abilities to shift the result (e.g., sum +1).  
   - Allocation is simultaneous and independent.

4. **Gain Rewards**  
   - **Active Player**: Gains Blue rewards from Stationed (top) cards in chosen sectors.  
   - **Passive Players**: Gain Red rewards from Deployed (under-board) cards in chosen sectors.  
   - Charge Cubes: Place 1 in each empty Blue (Active) or Red (Passive) charge square on activated sectors.  
   - Multiple Arrows: Can chain (e.g., 3 → 4 → 5), but no loops. No wrap-around (12 ↔ 1).  
   - 2x Ability: After normal rewards, double rewards from one activated sector (Blue for Active, Red for Passive).

5. **Abilities May Be Used**  
   - Same as Step 1.

6. **Buy One Card (Active Player Only)**  
   - May buy **one** Ship or Colony Card from the available displays.  
   - Spend **all** current Money (even if card costs less).  
   - If buying a Ship:  
     - Deploy the current Stationed card in that Sector (add to bottom of Deployed stack).  
     - Place new card in the Sector.  
   - If buying a Colony Card:  
     - Score VP immediately.  
     - Sector is permanently locked: no future Ship purchases.  
     - Deployed cards still trigger on Passive turns.  
   - *Abilities allowing extra buys* (e.g., "Buy a Card") are separate and do not reset Money to 0.

7. **Abilities May Be Used**  
   - Same as Step 1.

8. **Refill Shipyard**  
   - Replace any purchased Ship Cards by sliding remaining cards left and drawing new ones from the correct deck.  
   - Colony Cards are **not** refilled.  
   - *With Shy Plutonium*: Refill Plutonium Dice from bag.  
   - *With Sector 13*: Refill Upgrade Cards.

9. **Income**  
   - If Active Player’s Money is less than Income, set Money equal to Income.

10. **End of Turn**  
   - Apply any “end of turn” effects.  
   - Next player clockwise becomes Active Player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Activations and Charges  
- Abilities are marked with a white dot (•) in the top-left.  
- Charge Cubes are placed during **Gain Rewards** if the activated sector has a matching empty charge square (Blue for Active, Red for Passive).  
- To **use** an ability: remove required charge cubes.  
  - Unlinked squares: spend 1 cube per use (even if others are empty).  
  - Linked squares: must be fully charged (chain symbol).  
  - Pips in squares: required only if number of players matches pip count.  
- Green abilities: usable on any turn.  
- Blue: only on your turn.  
- Red: only on opponents’ turns.  
- Charge cubes may be transferred when a card is Deployed (if target has charge squares). Otherwise, lost.

#### Reward Types  
- **Money/Income/VP**: Move corresponding marker.  
- **Arrows**: Gain rewards from adjacent sector (left/right). Multiple arrows chain.  
- **2 Dice + Arrow**: Use sum, gain reward 1 or 2 sectors away.  
- **Buy a Card**: Buy one card; pay exact cost. Does not count as normal buy.  
- **Claim a Card**: Take a specified card for free. Can claim even in a locked sector.  
- **Swap Sectors**: Exchange all cards (Stationed and Deployed) between two sectors.  
- **Reroll Dice**: Use before allocation.  
- **Set Dice**: Choose both die values before rolling.  
- **Place 1 Charge Anywhere**: Add a charge cube to any of your charge squares.  
- **Place Card in 7–12**: Play a card in any Sector 7–12, regardless of printed number.  
- **Exchange This Card**: Swap with another card in same position (Stationed ↔ Stationed, Deployed ↔ Deployed).  
- **YOU WIN!**: Immediate victory when activated.

#### Special Rules  
- **Colony Cards**: Once placed, block future Ship purchases in that Sector.  
- **Charge Timing**: A charge cube gained during a turn may be spent the same turn, but **not** to affect rewards from the same die roll.  
- **No Infinite Loops**: Arrows and abilities cannot create reward loops.  
- **Resource Limits**: No cap on Money, Income, or VP. Track values >40 by placing a charge cube on 40 and restarting from 0.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when **any player reaches 40 or more VP**.  
- Finish the current round so all players have taken an equal number of turns.  
- The player with the most VP wins.  
- **Tie**: All tied players (and possibly others) take one more full round. Repeat until one player leads.  
- VP above 40 are tracked normally (e.g., 42 VP = 42 spaces or 40 + 2).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use an ability to change dice after allocation?**  
  No. Dice-altering abilities must be used **before** allocation.  
- **Can I claim a card in a colonized sector?**  
  Yes. Claimed cards can be deployed there.  
- **Do I get charge cubes for a colonized sector?**  
  Yes, if you activate it while Passive (via Deployed cards).  
- **Can I use 2x on a claimed reward?**  
  No. 2x only applies to rewards from dice allocation.  
- **What happens to charges when swapping sectors?**  
  Charges stay with the card.  
- **Can I use “Set Dice” on another player’s turn?**  
  Only if you have a Green ability and it's your turn to use abilities.  
- **Does “Buy a Card” ability reset Money to 0?**  
  No. You pay the exact cost and keep the rest. Only the normal buy resets to 0.
