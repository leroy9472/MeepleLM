## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Ticket to Ride is a cross-country train adventure where players build rail routes across a map to fulfill destination tickets and earn points. The goal is to score the most points by claiming routes, completing destination tickets, and potentially earning bonus points for achievements like the longest continuous route.

### 2. Components
- Colored train car pieces (45 per player in most versions)
- Train cards in multiple colors and wild locomotives
- Destination Ticket cards
- Scoring marker and score track
- Game board with city network and routes
- Bonus cards (e.g., Longest Path, Globetrotter)
- Optional components vary by version (e.g., stations, passengers, terrain cards)

### 3. Setup
- Each player takes a set of 45 train cars (35 in UK, 40 in Nordic/Switzerland/Nederland) and places scoring marker at 0.
- Shuffle train deck; deal 4 cards to each player (8 in France, 1 locomotive + 4 in UK).
- Place 5 train cards face-up; if 3 are locomotives, replace all 5.
- Shuffle destination tickets:
  - USA: Deal 3, keep 2–3
  - Europe: Deal 1 long + 3 short, keep 2–4
  - Nordic/Switzerland: Deal 5, keep 2–5
  - UK/France/Pennsylvania: Deal 5, keep 3–5
  - India/Märklin: Deal 4, keep 2–4
  - Nederland: Deal 5, keep 3–5 (discard face-up)
- Place bonus card(s) nearby (e.g., Longest Path, Globetrotter).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn, perform **one** of the following actions:

#### 1) Collect 2 Train Cards
- Draw from:
  - Face-up cards (max 1 locomotive counts as both draws)
  - Deck (blind draw)
  - One face-up, then one blind or face-up (replace first immediately)
- If you take a face-up locomotive, you get only that one card.
- If you draw a locomotive from the deck, you may draw a second card.
- If 3 locomotives are face-up at any time, discard all 5 and replace.

#### 2) Claim a Route
- Play a set of train cards matching the route’s color and length.
- Grey routes: use any single color.
- Locomotives act as wild cards.
- Double routes: only one per player; in 2–3 player games, only one path is usable (except Hong Kong–Canton in Asia).
- Place your trains on the route; score points immediately based on length:
  - 1:1, 2:2, 3:4, 4:7, 5:10, 6+:15
- Cannot claim partial routes.

#### 3) Draw Destination Tickets
- Draw 3–4 tickets (varies by version).
- Must keep at least 1.
- Discard unkept tickets (to bottom of deck or out of game, depending on version).
- Tickets remain secret until endgame.

#### Special Actions (by Version)
- **Europe/Expanded**: Build a Station (discard 1/2/3 matching cards for 1st/2nd/3rd station). Stations let you use one opponent’s route per station for ticket completion.
- **Marklin**: Move a Passenger (4th action). Travel along your routes, collecting merchandise tokens. Passenger cards let you “borrow” opponent routes.
- **Asia (Team)**: On your turn, you may place up to 2 destination tickets from hand to common holder.
- **France**: After drawing train cards, place one track tile on a “track bed” of matching length.
- **United Kingdom**: Before your turn, discard locomotives to buy Technologies (e.g., Right of Way, Water Tenders).
- **Old West**: After claiming a route, spend 2 matching cards to place a City Marker in either city. Route points go to city controller(s).
- **Africa**: You may draw a Terrain Card instead of a Train Card. Use matching Terrain Cards to double route points when claiming (if you have at least as many as any other player).
- **India**: Grand Tour Bonus — for tickets where both cities are connected by two distinct, non-overlapping routes, earn bonus: 1:5, 2:10, 3:20, 4:30, 5+:40.
- **Legendary Asia**: For Mountain Routes (marked with X), discard 1 train per X; score +2 points per discarded train.
- **Switzerland**: Locomotives can only be used to claim Tunnels.
- **Nederland**: Pay Bridge Toll Tokens when claiming second route of a double; loans (-5 each) if unable to pay.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Turn Structure**: One action per turn.
- **Hand Management**: No limit on train or destination cards.
- **Route Claiming**: Cards must match route color/length; locomotives are wild.
- **Endgame Trigger**: When any player has ≤2 trains left, all players get one final turn.
- **Scoring**: Points are scored during the game (routes) and at endgame (tickets, bonuses).
- **Tiebreakers**: Most completed destination tickets, then longest continuous path.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Final scoring occurs after the final turn:
1. **Route Points**: Already scored during play.
2. **Destination Tickets**:
   - Add points for completed tickets.
   - Subtract points for uncompleted tickets.
3. **Bonuses**:
   - **Longest Continuous Path**: +10 (all ties get full bonus).
   - **Most Completed Tickets (Globetrotter)**: +10 or +15 (varies by version).
   - **Unused Stations (Europe)**: +4 each.
   - **Unused Depots (Warehouses/Depots variant)**: +10 for most.
   - **Alvin & Dexter (mini-expansion)**: +15 each for most cards.
   - **Bridge Tolls (Nederland)**: Score based on token count.
   - **Stock Shares (Pennsylvania)**: Score per railroad based on share count and lowest number in case of tie.
   - **Technologies (UK)**: Score bonuses as claimed (e.g., Right of Way, Double Heading).
   - **Grand Tour (India)**: Bonus points for tickets with two distinct connections.

**Winning**: Highest total score wins. Tiebreakers:
- Most completed destination tickets
- Longest continuous path
- Other version-specific tiebreakers (e.g., fewest stations built in Europe, most mountain routes in Legendary Asia)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I claim a route I can’t complete?** No — must play all required cards in one turn.
- **What if I draw a locomotive as a replacement card?** It remains face-up; cannot be taken as second card if first was face-up.
- **Can I use locomotives for terrain cards (Africa)?** Yes — locomotives can substitute for terrain cards.
- **Do stations count toward longest path?** No — stations and borrowed routes do not extend your continuous path.
- **Can teammates in Asia claim both routes of a double?** Yes — each player on a team can claim one, even same color.
- **What happens if train deck runs out?** Reshuffle discard pile into new deck.
- **Can I use a technology immediately after buying it?** Yes — technologies are active immediately.
- **Do I score route points in Old West at end?** No — score immediately when claimed; controller gets points.
