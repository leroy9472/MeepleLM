### 1. Lore & Objective
Gold Nuggets is a fan-made expansion for Thunder Road: Vendetta that adds collectible power-up tokens to the game. Players race and battle while collecting hidden nuggets scattered across the road tiles. Each nugget provides a unique, one-time ability that can be used strategically to gain an edge. The objective remains the same as the base game: be the first to reach the finish line or be the last player with operable vehicles.

### 2. Components
- 20 nuggets of 10 different types (2 copies of each)
- Nuggets are represented using inner circles of fire tokens from the "Carnival at Devil's Run" expansion

### 3. Setup
- Place all 20 nuggets face down.
- Select 12 nuggets to place on the board using the following procedure:
  - Rear road tile: Place 4 nuggets in a line on the last row (furthest from the exit).
  - Middle and lead tiles: Roll a die and count from the last row forward to determine the placement row.
- Nuggets must be placed on passable spaces in the same row. Prioritize placement order as follows: hazard, toxic cloud, mud, fire, ramp, desert glass, off-road.
- If fewer than 4 passable spaces exist, place as many nuggets as possible.
- If more than 4 exist, place only 4, prioritizing the above order.
- Reserve nuggets not placed initially are kept for replenishment.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Nuggets are placed face down at setup.
- When a ground vehicle enters a space containing a nugget, it collects it before applying any terrain effect or hazard.
- The collecting player looks at the nugget and places it face down on their vehicle’s dashboard.
- The nugget may be used at any time, subject to its specific ability.
- Once used:
  - Black-background nuggets return to the reserve.
  - Yellow-background nuggets are placed face up in play.
- If a vehicle is destroyed or becomes non-operational, its nuggets are returned to the reserve (see Variants for exceptions).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Collecting Nuggets**: A vehicle collects a nugget upon entering its space. Flying over (e.g., via ramp or being thrown) does not count as entering.
- **Single Use**: Each nugget is used once and then discarded or returned to reserve.
- **Exclusive Use**: Nuggets can only be used by the vehicle that collected them.
- **Row Limit**: A vehicle cannot collect more than one nugget per row in a single turn. The second nugget in the same row is ignored.
- **Resupply**: If reserve nuggets run out, recover them from board areas where all vehicles have passed. If still insufficient, place as many as possible.

#### Nugget Types & Effects
- **Amulet**: Reroll any FX die (including fire die) affecting this vehicle.
- **Nails**: Place face up in an adjacent empty space during your turn. If another vehicle enters, it rolls the shooting die. Hit = stops, stunned (roll direction and stunt die); Miss = continues.
- **Rocket Booster**: After movement, roll stunt die and move that many spaces straight forward.
- **Reflective Shield**: Play before shooting die is rolled. Shooter becomes the target. Treat helicopters as size M. If hit, helicopter becomes non-operational and is placed off-board; requires "Repair" command to retrieve.
- **Fire Extinguisher**: Changes fire die result from "eliminated" to "fire goes out".
- **M-15 Mine**: Place face up in adjacent empty space. Entering vehicle rolls shooting die. Hit = stops, takes damage; Miss = continues. Mine returns to reserve.
- **Molotov**: During your turn, place a "Catching Fire" token on an adjacent vehicle.
- **Paragliding**: When entering a space with another vehicle, treat it as a ramp instead of crashing.
- **RPG**: During shoot phase, target a helicopter adjacent to your vehicle. Treat helicopters as size M. If hit, helicopter becomes non-operational and is placed off-board; requires "Repair" to retrieve.
- **Dynamite**: Place on an adjacent vehicle. Owner places it face up on their dashboard. Can pass it to another vehicle on their next move. If not passed, it explodes at end of turn, dealing damage. Exploded dynamite returns to reserve.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Nuggets do not contribute directly to scoring.
- The game ends when:
  - A player moves a vehicle onto the finish line, or
  - A player is the last with operable vehicles.
- Use of nuggets may influence victory but do not alter win conditions.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you collect a nugget during a coast?** Yes, coasting counts as entering a space.
- **Can you collect a nugget from a hazard space?** Yes, as long as the vehicle enters normally.
- **What if a vehicle is thrown into a nugget space by a slam or effect?** No, only vehicles that "enter" collect nuggets. Flying or being thrown does not count.
- **Can you use a nugget after your vehicle becomes non-operational?** No, nuggets are returned to reserve when the vehicle is destroyed or becomes non-operable.
- **What happens to nuggets if a vehicle is eliminated?** They are returned to the reserve.
- **Can you use multiple nuggets in one turn?** Yes, as long as they belong to the same vehicle and are used at appropriate times.
- **Can a vehicle collect two nuggets from different rows in one move?** Yes, as long as they are not in the same row.
