# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Sekigahara is a two-player wargame simulating the 1600 campaign that led to the founding of the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan. One player commands the Eastern Army (Tokugawa Ieyasu), the other the Western Army (Ishida Mitsunari). The goal is to eliminate the opposing leader or achieve victory through superior control of strategic locations by the end of the game.

## 2. Components
- 1 game board depicting central Honshu, Japan
- 96 rectangular blocks (48 black for Eastern Army, 48 yellow for Western Army)
- 20 small cubes (10 black, 10 yellow) for tracking control and impact
- 2 disks (1 yellow, 2 black) representing key figures and destructible castles
- 1 square turn marker
- 2 decks of cards (one per army)
- 2 draw bags
- 2 identical reference cards

## 3. Setup
- Place the turn marker on Week 1.
- Shuffle each player’s deck separately. Each player draws 5 cards.
- Place blocks with setup symbols in their matching map locations, with owner-facing identity concealed. Exception: The 6 Mori blocks in the Mori box remain face-up.
- Randomly place remaining blocks in locations marked with +1, +2, or +4, specifying location before drawing.
- Eastern Army draws 4 blocks into their Recruitment Box. Western Army draws 2 blocks.
- Place disks: Toyotomi Hideyori (yellow) at Osaka, Torii Mototada (black) at Kyoto, Mogami Yoshiaki (black) at Yamagata.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game week follows this sequence:
1. **Reinforcement Step** (skipped in Week 1)
2. **Turn Order Step**
3. **Turn A**
   - First player: Movement Phase → Combat Phase
   - Second player: Movement Phase → Combat Phase
4. **Turn B** (same structure as Turn A)
5. Advance turn marker to next week. Game ends after Week 8.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Movement Phase
At the start, the active player discards 0, 1, or 2 cards to determine movement capacity:
- **0 cards – No Movement**: No stacks move. Player may discard and redraw any number of cards.
- **0 cards – Minimal Movement**: Move one stack OR conduct one Muster.
- **1 card – Limited Movement**: Move up to three stacks OR two stacks and one Muster.
- **2 cards – Total Movement**: Move all stacks AND conduct one Muster.

**Movement Rules**:
- A stack is all blocks in one location.
- Blocks may split ("fork") during movement but each road segment may be used only once per phase.
- No block may move more than once per turn.
- Base movement: 1 location.
- **Bonuses**:
  - +1 for moving entirely on highways
  - +1 for starting movement with leadership (leader, controlled aligned castle, or capital)
  - +1 for force marching (discard 1 card per stack that starts and ends together)
- **Penalty**: -1 movement for every 4 blocks beyond the first 4 in a moving group (e.g., 5–8 blocks: -1, 9–12: -2).
- Mustered blocks cannot move in the same turn.

### Mustering
- Blocks from Recruitment Box may be placed at friendly recruitment locations (marked with clan mon).
- Two options:
  - Muster all blocks of one daimyo to matching location (must show opponent).
  - Muster one block of any daimyo to any friendly recruitment location (no need to show).
- Can support ongoing combat but cannot initiate attack.

### Overruns
- Occurs when a force has at least 4× the blocks of an enemy force in a location.
- Resolved immediately: enemy units destroyed, no casualties to overrunner.
- Overrun units may continue moving.
- Cannot occur against forces inside a castle; castle forces contribute to defending against overruns.

### Combat Phase
Combat occurs in all locations with opposing forces, resolved one at a time.

**Battle (no castle involvement)**:
- Attacker deploys first.
- Deployment requires matching card (except Ishida and Li Naomasa blocks, deployable with any card).
- Leader blocks may deploy without a card before any card is played.
- Double cards allow two deployments (one at a time).
- Initiative alternates to the side with lower impact; defender wins ties.
- Player may pass, giving opponent unlimited deployment.
- Loyalty Challenge: Played after opponent deployment. If opponent cannot show another matching card, block defects temporarily.

**Impact Calculation**:
- Base: number of mon on block.
- +1 for each previously deployed block of same clan.
- Special Attack: +2 if deploying cavalry/gun block with sword-marked card; +2 per previously deployed matching special unit.

**Siege**:
- Occurs if defender (≤2 blocks) chooses to remain inside a castle.
- Attacker deploys freely; defender does not deploy.
- No special attacks or loyalty challenges.
- Defender loses one block/disk per 7 attacker impact.
- Defender draws 1 card per block lost.

### Losses and Retreats
- Both sides lose 1 block per 7 impact (rounded down).
- Loser loses one additional block.
- Loss order: defected blocks, then deployed, then undeployed.
- Loser retreats to one adjacent location.
- Defender may retreat into castle (up to 2 blocks) if controlled prior.
- Retreats into combat or overrun are resolved immediately.

### Card Replenishment
After combat or overrun:
- Discard all played cards and draw back equal number.
- Draw +1 card per 2 blocks lost (round down).
- In siege: defender draws +1 card per block lost.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Instant Victory**:
  - Eastern Army wins if Ishida Mitsunari (yellow 3-dot leader) is killed OR Toyotomi Hideyori (yellow disk) is captured.
  - Western Army wins if Tokugawa Ieyasu (black 3-dot leader) is killed.
- **Victory Points (if no instant win by end of Week 8)**:
  - 2 VP per controlled castle
  - 1 VP per controlled resource location
- Highest total wins. Tie goes to Western Army.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Mori Box**: Western player may move one Mori block to Osaka per card discarded during Movement Phase. Last block is Mori leader. If Osaka is attacked, all Mori blocks immediately appear in battle.
- **Leadership**: Only one +1 bonus even with multiple sources. Leader block must be declared but not revealed.
- **Force March**: Costs 1 card per stack that moves together; applies only to blocks that start and end together.
- **Double Cards with Wildcards**: If used to deploy Ishida or Li Naomasa, only one block may be deployed.
- **Disk Destruction**: Destroying Toyotomi Hideyori disk ends game (Eastern victory). Other disks provide VP if surviving.
