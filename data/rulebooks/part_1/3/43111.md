### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Chaos in the Old World*, four Ruinous Powers—Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, and Slaanesh—vie for dominance over the Warhammer Old World. Each god embodies a different aspect of chaos: Khorne (violence), Nurgle (decay), Tzeentch (change), and Slaanesh (excess). The goal is to achieve victory by either advancing your Threat dial to Victory, scoring 50+ Victory Points (VPs), having five regions ruined, or causing the Old World deck to run out (in which case all players lose).

Victory conditions are checked in priority order:
1. A player reaches the Victory instruction on their Threat dial (tiebreaker: most VPs, then highest Threat).
2. A player scores 50+ VPs (tiebreaker: highest Threat).
3. Five regions are ruined (tiebreaker: highest Threat).
4. The Old World deck is exhausted (all players lose).

### 2. Components
- Game board with nine regions
- Four Power sheets (one per Chaos Power)
- Four Threat dials
- Plastic follower figures (Cultists, Warriors, Greater Daemons)
- Chaos Cards (unique decks per Power)
- Upgrade Cards
- Ruination Cards (numbered 1–5)
- Old World Cards
- Tokens: Corruption, Noble, Peasant, Hero, Warpstone, Skaven (if Horned Rat is in play)
- Markers: Power, Victory Point (VP), Dial Advancement Counters

### 3. Setup
1. Place the board centrally. Set each Threat dial to its "Start" position.
2. Players choose or randomly assign Power sheets. Seat players clockwise in order: Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, Slaanesh.
3. Each player takes:
   - Their Power sheet, VP marker (set to 0), power marker (set to starting value on sheet)
   - Chaos card deck, shuffle, and draw 3 cards
   - Follower figures, corruption tokens, and unused upgrade cards (tucked under sheet)
4. Prepare the Ruination Card stack: 1 on top, 5 on bottom.
5. Form the Old World deck: 8 cards (3 players) or 7 cards (4 players); shuffle and place face down.
6. Randomly place one Old World token per region from a mixed pool of:
   - 2 Noble tokens
   - 3 Warpstone tokens
   - 4 Peasant tokens
   (For Horned Rat expansion: replace 2 Peasant tokens with 2 Skaven tokens.)

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds through six phases:

#### 1. Old World Phase
- Draw the top Old World card.
- The player with the lowest Threat executes its italicized instruction.
- Unless stated otherwise, place the card in slot 1 of the Old World track. Push existing cards right; discard any card bumped from slot 2.

#### 2. Draw Phase
- Each player draws a number of Chaos cards as specified on their Power sheet.
- Reset power marker to the highlighted value on the Power sheet (may exceed if upgrades grant extra power).
- Unused power does not carry over.

#### 3. Summoning Phase
- Players act in Power order (Khorne → Nurgle → Tzeentch → Slaanesh), repeating until all pass.
- On your turn, you may:
  - Summon a follower (pay power cost), or
  - Play a Chaos card (pay cost, place in empty region card slot).
- Followers must be placed in a region with your figure or adjacent to one.
- If you have no figures on the board, you may place your first figure in any region.
- If you cannot or choose not to act, set your power marker to 0. Phase ends when all are at 0.

#### 4. Battle Phase
- Resolve battles region by region in order: Norsca → Troll Country → Kislev → The Empire → Bretonnia → Estalia → Tilea → Border Princes → Badlands.
- A battle occurs in a region if at least one player can roll battle dice and has a legal target (enemy figure or Peasant token).
- For each region:
  1. Each player, in Power order:
     - Rolls battle dice = total attack value of their figures + card effects.
     - Rolls additional dice for explosions (each 6 rolled grants one extra die, which can also explode).
     - Assigns hits (4–6 = hit; 6 explodes).
  2. Hits must be assigned to valid targets.
  3. A figure is killed (tipped) if hits ≥ its defense.
  4. Peasant tokens killed are claimed by the killer.
- After all players roll and assign:
  - Tipped figures are removed (except those killed by "beginning of battle" effects, which are removed immediately).
- Beginning/end-of-battle effects resolve before/after all regional battles.

#### 5. Corruption Phase
**Domination Step (by region order):**
- Each player’s Domination Value = sum of Chaos card costs played in region + number of figures controlled there.
- If one player has the highest value and it exceeds the region’s Resistance, they score VPs equal to the region’s Conquest Value.
- In case of tie, no one scores.

**Corruption Step (by region order):**
- Each player places 1 corruption token per Cultist they control in the region.
- Warpstone tokens count as one corruption token each.
- If total corruption (including Warpstone) ≥ 12, the region is ruined:
  - Place the top Ruination Card face up.
  - Each player who placed at least one corruption token this phase scores the "Ruiners Score X Points Each" amount.
- Ruined regions block new Chaos cards, Old World tokens, and corruption placement. Dominance is not checked.

#### 6. End Phase
1. **Remove Chaos Cards:** Discard all played Chaos cards.
2. **Resolve Hero Tokens:** In each region with a Hero, the player with the highest Threat removes one of their figures.
3. **Resolve Old World Cards:** Apply persistent effects (e.g., "When Old World cards are resolved…") in track order (slot 1 first).
4. **Score Ruined Regions:** For each region ruined this round:
   - Player with most corruption tokens scores first value.
   - Player with second-most scores second value.
   - Tie for first: sum both values, divide by number of tied players (round down).
   - Tie for second: divide second value by number of tied players (round down).
   - Turn Ruination Card face down; clear corruption tokens.
5. **Advance Threat Dials:**
   - Every player with at least one dial advancement counter advances one tick.
   - Player with most counters advances one extra tick (no extra if tied for most).
   - Return all counters to pool.
6. **Check for Game End:** Immediately end if any victory condition is met (in order listed above).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Dial Advancement Conditions:**
  - **Khorne:** Kill one or more enemy figures in a battle.
  - **Nurgle:** Dominate a Populous region (5+ of your figures) during Corruption Phase.
  - **Tzeentch:** Place 2+ corruption tokens in a region with ≥2 combined Warpstone tokens and/or magic symbols.
  - **Slaanesh:** Place 2+ corruption tokens in a region with a Noble or Hero token.
  - **Horned Rat (expansion):** Dominate a region containing ≥1 Skaven token.
- **Contradictory Effects:** Disabling effects beat enabling effects.
- **Control of Enemy Figures:** Controlled figures act as your own (battle, corruption, etc.).
- **Chaos Card Effects:** Mandatory if possible; cumulative unless inherently non-cumulative.
- **Ruined Regions:** No new cards/tokens/corruption; battles and adjacency still function.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Conditions (checked in order):**
  1. Threat dial reaches "Victory!" instruction.
  2. Player reaches 50+ VPs.
  3. Five regions ruined.
  4. Old World deck exhausted (all lose).
- **Tiebreakers:**
  - Dial Victory: Most VPs → Highest Threat.
  - 50+ VPs: Highest Threat.
  - Five Ruined Regions: Highest Threat.
- **Scoring:**
  - Domination: Conquest Value (increased by Nobles).
  - Ruination (immediate): Ruiner points from Ruination Card.
  - Ruination (end phase): First and second values based on total corruption.
  - Old World cards and dial effects may award VPs.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you store hits?** No. You must assign enough hits to kill a figure if targeting it.
- **Do hits carry over between battles?** No. Each battle is self-contained.
- **Can a single event trigger multiple dial advancements?** No. One event = one counter.
- **Do Peasants count for dial advancement?** No. Only figures (plastic units).
- **Can you play Chaos cards in ruined regions?** No.
- **Can Hero tokens be removed?** Only by specific card effects.
- **Does Warp Shield protect from removal effects?** No. It only prevents death in battle.
- **Can Tzeentch’s Drain Power work with no enemies present?** Yes. Tzeentch gains 1 power regardless.
- **Can you summon the same figure multiple times per round?** Yes, if you can pay and follow placement rules.
- **Do Nobles increase Conquest Value?** Yes, by 1 per Noble.
