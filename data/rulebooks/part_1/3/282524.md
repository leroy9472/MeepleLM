# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Horrified is a cooperative game where all players win or lose together. The players win by defeating all Monsters in play. Each Monster must have a unique task completed before it can be defeated. The game is lost if:
- The Terror Level reaches the skull (maximum level).
- The Monster deck is exhausted when a card needs to be drawn.

## 2. Components
- Game Board
- 7 Hero Badges and Movers
- 6 Monster Mats and 7 Monster Figures (Frankenstein and Bride are separate figures)
- 10 Villager Movers
- 60 Item Tokens (Red, Yellow, Blue; various strengths and locations)
- 20 Monster Tokens (Coffins, Scarabs, Soul Sign, Hunted Emblem, Cure, Dials, Boat, etc.)
- 30 Monster Cards
- 20 Perk Cards
- 1 Frenzy Marker
- 1 Terror Marker
- 1 Item Bag
- 3 Dice
- 5 Reference Cards

## 3. Setup
1. Place the board and set Terror Marker to "0" (or "3" in solo).
2. Place Villagers and dice beside the board.
3. Shuffle Monster Cards into a deck.
4. Choose 2–4 Monsters to play against.
5. Place chosen Monster Mats in a row from lowest to highest Frenzy Order (top-left number).
6. Set Frenzy Marker on the leftmost Monster Mat.
7. Set up each Monster per its mat instructions (e.g., place Coffins, Scarabs, etc.).
8. Each player chooses a Hero, places their mover at the starting location, and receives a Badge.
9. Shuffle Perk Cards and deal 1 face-up to each player.
10. Place all 60 Items in the bag. Draw 12 randomly and place them at their indicated locations.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn has two phases:
1. **Hero Phase**: The active player takes up to the number of actions shown on their Hero Badge. Actions include Move, Guide, Pick Up, Share, Advance, Defeat, and Special Action. Any player may play Perk Cards during this phase (does not cost an action).
2. **Monster Phase**: Draw a Monster Card and resolve its three parts in order:
   - **Items**: Draw and place the number of Items shown.
   - **Event**: Resolve the text. Gray cards affect Villagers; colored cards affect a specific Monster.
   - **Monster Strike**: Move and attack with Monsters from left to right. The Frenzied Monster (marked by Frenzy Marker) activates when its symbol appears.

After both phases, play proceeds clockwise.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Actions (Each counts as 1 action)
- **Move**: Move Hero 1 space along lit paths. May carry any number of Villagers.
- **Guide**: Move 1 adjacent Villager into your space or 1 Villager from your space to an adjacent space.
- **Pick Up**: Take any number of Items from your space.
- **Share**: All Heroes in your space may freely trade Items.
- **Advance**: Use Items to progress a Monster’s task (location and method vary by Monster).
- **Defeat**: Use Items to defeat a Monster after its task is complete.
- **Special Action**: Unique to each Hero (e.g., pick up from adjacent space).

### Items
- Colored (Red, Yellow, Blue), with strength (1–6) and location.
- When used, place in discard pile unless placed on Monster Mat (e.g., Wolf Man, Invisible Man).
- If bag is empty when drawing, refill from discard pile.
- Multiple Items of same color can be used in one action unless specified otherwise.

### Perk Cards
- Kept face-up. Can be played by any player during any Hero Phase.
- Does not cost an action. Discard after use.
- Cannot be played during Monster Phase.

### Villagers
- Placed during Events. Have safe locations (marked on mover).
- Move via Guide or Move actions.
- When a Villager reaches their safe location, remove it and the current player draws a Perk Card (reshuffle discard if needed).
- Defeated instantly when hit by a Monster.

### Monster Phase Details
- **Move**: Monster moves toward closest Person (Hero > Villager). Shortest path; active player chooses in ties.
- **Attack**: Roll dice as shown. Target must be declared before rolling.
  - **Hit (●)**: Defeats Villagers instantly. Heroes may discard 1 Item per Hit to ignore.
  - **Power (★)**: Triggers Monster’s special ability.
- **Defeated Hero**: Remove from board, increase Terror by 1. Returns at Hospital at start of next turn with all Items and Perks.

### Frenzied Monster
- One Monster always has the Frenzy Marker.
- When the Frenzy symbol appears, that Monster moves and attacks.
- Events may move the Frenzy Marker to the next Monster (by Frenzy Order; loops back if needed).
- Only Frankenstein (not the Bride) can be Frenzied.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### Win Condition
- Defeat all Monsters → immediate win.

### Loss Conditions
- Terror Level reaches skull → immediate loss.
- Need to draw Monster Card but deck is empty → immediate loss.

Note: After the last Monster Card is drawn, one final Hero Phase is played.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Items**: Picking up multiple Items takes one action. Discarded Items go to a pile; bag is refilled when empty.
- **Sharing**: All Heroes in the same space can freely trade any number of Items in one Share action.
- **Defeated Heroes**: Can still play Perk Cards. Return at Hospital on next turn.
- **Monster Movement via Perk**: Optional/up to the value. Follow Hero movement rules.
- **Frankenstein & Bride Meeting**: Counts if they pass each other during movement. Instantly increases Terror by 1 and resets their positions.
- **Multiple Hits**: Only one Terror increase per defeated Person, regardless of number of Hits.
- **Item Use Limits**: Only one Item can be used per action unless specified (e.g., defeating Dracula allows multiple yellow Items).
- **Monster Tasks**:
  - **Dracula**: Smash 4 Coffins (discard red Items totaling 6+ each). Then defeat with yellow Items totaling 6+.
  - **Mummy**: Align 6 Scarabs face-up in correct spots at Museum. Defeat with red Items totaling 9+.
  - **Frankenstein & Bride**: Increase humanity to 11 (yellow) and 8 (blue). When both dials are flipped, defeat them by bringing them together.
  - **Creature**: Move Boat to Lair (final blue X) by discarding Items at Camp. Defeat by discarding one of each color.
  - **Wolf Man**: Fill 6 blue Item spots at Laboratory. Defeat with red Items totaling 9+ and the Cure.
