### 1. Lore & Objective
In the Dune universe, powerful factions vie for control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the valuable spice melange. Players represent one of these factions, each with unique strengths and goals. Victory is achieved either by military dominance—occupying 3 strongholds alone or 4 in alliance—or through special faction victory conditions. The game emphasizes strategy, diplomacy, and betrayal, culminating in a maximum of 10 turns.

### 3. Setup
1. **Positions**: Players place Player Markers on player circles around the board to determine order.
2. **Traitors**: Remove unused faction cards from Traitor Deck. Each player is dealt 4 Traitor Cards, selects one to keep (Harkonnen keeps all 4), returns others to the bottom of the deck.
3. **Spice**: Each player receives starting spice as per their Player Sheet.
4. **Forces**: Place forces on the board according to faction-specific starting positions.
5. **Treachery Cards**: Deal 1 Treachery Card to each player (Harkonnen gets 2).
6. **Turn Marker**: Place at Turn 1 on Turn Track.
7. **Decks**: Shuffle Spice and Treachery Decks, place next to board.
8. **Special Setup**:
   - Bene Gesserit: Predict a faction and turn for victory using Prediction Deck.
   - Ixian (if in play): Place Hidden Mobile Stronghold (HMS).
   - Fremen (advanced): Preview next Storm Card.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of 9 phases in order:

1. **Storm Phase**
   - First turn: Two players adjacent to Storm Start dial 0–20; sum determines storm movement counterclockwise.
   - Subsequent turns: Storm moves based on revealed Storm Card (1–3 sectors); Fremen previews next card.
   - Forces in sand territories (except Imperial Basin) under storm are destroyed (Fremen lose half, rounded up).
   - First Player is the one whose marker the storm approaches next.

2. **Spice Blow and Nexus Phase**
   - Reveal top Spice Card:
     - Territory Card: Place spice in indicated sector.
     - Shai-Hulud (sandworm): Remove all forces and spice from territory on top of discard pile; start Nexus.
   - Draw additional cards until a Territory Card appears; place spice.
   - **Nexus**: Alliances may be formed or broken only during a Shai-Hulud draw.

3. **CHOAM Charity Phase**
   - Players with 0 or 1 spice receive enough from the bank to have 2 spice.
   - Bene Gesserit always receives 2 spice, regardless of current holdings.

4. **Bidding Phase**
   - Players declare number of Treachery Cards held (max 4, 8 for Harkonnen).
   - One card is placed face-down per player not at hand limit.
   - Bidding starts with First Player (or next eligible player), proceeds clockwise.
   - Highest bidder pays spice to Emperor (or bank if Emperor not in play) and takes the card.
   - Harkonnen receives a bonus free Treachery Card when winning a bid.
   - Atreides may look at each card before bidding.
   - Each player gets one chance to open bidding per round.

5. **Revival Phase**
   - All players may revive up to 3 forces.
     - Free revivals per faction (e.g., Fremen: 3, Atreides: 2).
     - Additional forces cost 2 spice each.
   - If all 5 leaders are in Tleilaxu Tanks, a player may revive one leader per turn, paying its fighting strength in spice.
   - Revived leaders remain traitors if previously traitorous.
   - A revived leader killed again cannot be revived until all others are revived and killed.

6. **Shipment and Movement Phase**
   - Starting with First Player, each player:
     - **Shipment**: Move any number of forces from reserves to one territory.
       - Cost: 1 spice/force to stronghold, 2 spice/force elsewhere.
       - Cannot ship into storm sectors (Fremen may ship in at half losses).
       - Cannot ship into stronghold occupied by two other players.
     - **Movement**: Move one group of forces one territory.
       - With forces in Arrakeen or Carthag: move up to 3 territories (ornithopters).
       - Otherwise: move one adjacent territory.
   - Factions with special movement (Fremen, Ixian) may move farther.
   - Spacing Guild may take their turn out of order.

7. **Battle Phase**
   - Battles occur in territories with multiple factions.
   - First Player is aggressor, chooses battle order.
   - Each battle:
     - Players secretly create Battle Plans:
       - Dial number of forces to lose (0 to available).
       - Play one leader or Cheap Hero.
       - Optionally play one weapon and/or one defense Treachery Card.
       - Optionally spend Spice Support (1 spice doubles one force’s strength).
     - Reveal simultaneously.
     - Check for Traitor: If opponent plays a leader you hold as Traitor, reveal card—automatic win, no losses, gain spice equal to leader’s strength.
     - If no Traitor, weapons without defense kill leaders.
     - Winner has higher total (dial + leader strength); aggressor wins ties.
     - Winner loses only dialed forces, may keep cards.
     - Loser loses all forces in territory and played cards.
   - Surviving leaders remain in territory until all battles resolved.

8. **Spice Harvest Phase**
   - Each force in a spice-containing sector collects:
     - 2 spice if not in Arrakeen or Carthag.
     - 3 spice if in Arrakeen or Carthag.
   - Occupant of each stronghold (Arrakeen, Carthag, Tuek’s Sietch) gains additional spice (2, 2, 1 respectively).

9. **Mentat Pause Phase**
   - Collect bribes from deals.
   - Check victory conditions:
     - Single player controls 3 strongholds → wins.
     - Alliance controls 4 strongholds → wins.
     - Special victories (e.g., Fremen, Spacing Guild) may apply.
   - If no winner, advance turn marker and begin next turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Storm Movement**: Determines First Player and destroys forces in sand.
- **Spice Blow**: Distributes spice; Shai-Hulud triggers Nexus for alliances.
- **Treachery Cards**: Acquired via bidding; used in battle for advantage.
- **Revival**: Limited force/leader return from Tleilaxu Tanks.
- **Movement**: Limited by position and faction abilities.
- **Battle**: Asymmetric information, Traitor mechanic, leader-based combat.
- **Alliances**: Formed only during Nexus; shared victory, joint bidding/shipping.
- **Karama Cards**: One-time faction powers or to block opponent advantages.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Conditions**:
  - Military: Control 3 strongholds (solo) or 4 (alliance) at Mentat Pause.
  - Special:
    - Bene Gesserit: Correctly predicted winning faction and turn.
    - Fremen: At game end, if Fremen (or no one) controls Sietch Tabr and Habbanya Sietch, and Harkonnen/Atreides/Emperor do not control Tuek’s Sietch → Fremen and allies win.
    - Spacing Guild: If no one wins by turn 10 → Spacing Guild wins.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  - If Fremen/Spacing Guild not in play, most strongholds wins.
  - If tied, most forces on board wins.
- Game ends immediately when any win condition is met.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Ties in Battle**: Aggressor (First Player) wins.
- **Multiple Players in Territory**: Aggressor chooses battle order.
- **Allied Forces in Same Territory**: One must move out during Movement Phase or lose forces.
- **Treachery Card Limits**: Players must declare hand size during bidding; cannot exceed limit.
- **Spice Support**: Only usable by non-Fremen; doubles strength of one force per spice.
- **Karama Use**: Cannot stop Special Karama Powers or core faction abilities like Harkonnen’s 8-card hand.
- **Revival Limits**: Only 3 forces per turn; 1 Sardaukar or Fedyakin per turn.
- **Leader Revival**: Possible only when all 5 are in Tanks.
- **Bene Gesserit Advisors**: Can coexist with allies only in Polar Sink; flip to fighters to battle.
