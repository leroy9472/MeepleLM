## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The goal is to earn the most prestige points by building your family’s legacy in the village. Players grow their families, harvest resources, craft goods, serve customers, travel, gain influence, and honor their ancestors through the Village Chronicle. The game ends when the Chronicle, anonymous graves, or sea burial spaces are filled. The player with the most prestige points wins, with ties broken by number of customers served, then by number of living family members.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Seed action spaces: Each round, refill green bag with required ICs and all Plague Cubes; randomly place cubes on action spaces per setup card.  
2. Player turns: In clockwise order, each player:  
   a. Takes 1 cube from an action space:  
      - Colored IC: Keep on farmyard (unlimited storage).  
      - Black Plague Cube: Return to supply, advance time marker 2 spaces.  
   b. Optionally performs the associated action (Market is mandatory).  
   c. Alternative: Use Well action by paying 3 same-colored ICs (not black) to perform any action.  
3. Round ends when last cube is removed from board.  
4. Mass Phase:  
   a. Starting with current first player, each may pay 1 coin per FM to guarantee drawing their own from black bag.  
   b. Draw 4 total pieces from black bag (randomly if needed). FMs go to rightmost church window; Monks return to bag.  
   c. Players may pay grain to move FMs up church hierarchy (left to right).  
   d. Award 2 prestige points to player with most FMs in church (tie: furthest left FM; still tied: all get 2 pts).  
   e. Player holding ring becomes next starting player; return ring to Council Chamber.
