## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Anno 1800*, players develop their home island’s productive capacity through industrial expansion, population growth, and trade. The goal is to build a thriving consumer economy in the Industrial Age by satisfying population demands, exploring the Old and New Worlds, and earning influence points (VP). The game ends when a player plays their last hand card, triggering a final round. The winner is the player with the most influence points, with tiebreakers based on number of buildings and fewest remaining cards.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### End Game Trigger  
- When any player plays their last hand card:
  - Take Fireworks token (7 VP).
  - Finish current round.
  - Play one final full round.

#### Final Scoring  
1. **Played Population Cards**: 3, 5, or 8 VP each (based on card).
2. **Expedition Cards**: Place population cubes (from any location) on matching animal/artifact fields. Score:
   - 2 VP per occupied field.
   - +1 VP per field if *Zoo* or *Museum* Objective Card is in play.
3. **Gold**: 3 gold = 1 VP.
4. **Fireworks Token**: 7 VP.
5. **Objective Cards**: Score all fulfilled conditions.

#### Objective Card Summary  
- **Aarchant**: Exhaust 1 Investor → gain 5 gold (once per turn).  
- **Alonso Graves**: Exhaust 3 Exploration + 3 gold → extra action (once per turn).  
- **Bente Jorgensen**: Have ≤1 Old World island → 18 VP.  
- **Beryl O’Mara**: 2 Exploration = 1 Trade (tokens exhausted, not exchanged).  
- **Dr. Hugo Mercier**: Pay 1 gold (Farmer/Worker) or 3 gold (Artisan/Engineer/Investor) to skip drawing a population card.  
- **The Editor**: Exhaust 2 Exploration → return 1 hand card to stack (no draw; once per turn).  
- **Isabel Sarmento**: 6 VP per explored New World island.  
- **Lady Margaret Hunt**: Gain 2 gold per construction tile returned during Expand action (including overbuilding).  
- **Pyrphorian**: Lose 2 VP per population card still in hand at game end.  
- **Carl Leonard von Malching, Eli Bleakworth, The Queen, Edvard Goode, Willie Wibblesock, Princess Qing**: Each built industry shown on card gives adjacent VP.  
- **Hannah Goode, University, World’s Fair, Madame Kahina, The Tourist**: Most of specified element (total cubes, Engineers, Investors, Trade tokens, Expedition cards) → 10 VP; second most → 4 VP. Ties: all tied players get respective points.  
- **Zoo, Museum**: +1 VP per occupied field on Expedition cards.

#### Tiebreakers  
1. Most total buildings (industries, shipyards, ships, including pre-printed).  
2. Fewest cards remaining in hand.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you trade for a resource from an occupied industry?**  
  Yes. Occupation does not block trade.

- **Can you combine shipyards to build a larger ship?**  
  No. Each shipyard builds one ship ≤ its strength.

- **Can you upgrade a cube already on a workplace?**  
  Yes. Replace with higher-level cube; no need to move.

- **Do you draw a card when upgrading a population?**  
  No. Cards are only drawn when gaining new cubes.

- **Can you use New World resources to pay action costs?**  
  Yes, but must exhaust 1 Trade token to produce the resource.

- **Can you trade for a good produced by a construction-side-up building?**  
  No. If building is face-down (blocking), the good is unavailable for trade.

- **Can you use Beryl O’Mara’s ability multiple times per turn?**  
  Yes. Each trade using 2 Exploration = 1 Trade counts separately.

- **Does Dr. Hugo Mercier apply to New World card draws?**  
  No. Only applies to Farmer/Worker and Artisan/Engineer/Investor draws.

- **What happens if a population card stack is empty during setup?**  
  Pay 1 gold per missing card. If cannot pay, action cannot be taken.
