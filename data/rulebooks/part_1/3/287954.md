## Azul Summer Pavilion — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
At the turn of the 16th century, King Manuel I of Portugal commissioned grand buildings. Though the Summer Pavilion was never built, players step in as master artisans tasked with constructing it using fine ceramic tiles. The objective is to score the most points over 6 rounds by strategically placing tiles on your player board while minimizing waste.

### 2. Components  
- 1 main scoring board (with score track and central tile supply)  
- 1 round counter  
- 1 first player token  
- 1 tower (tile discard area)  
- 4 player boards (each with 7 star patterns: 6 colored, 1 center multicolor)  
- 9 factory displays (coasters)  
- 132 tiles (22 each of 6 colors: red, blue, yellow, orange, green, purple)  
- 4 scoring markers (one per player)  
- 1 tile bag  

*Note: Solo variants use additional boards and modified rules (see Variant section).*

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the main board; set round counter to Round 1 (indicates wild color).  
2. Each player takes one player board (colored side up unless using variant), places it in front of them.  
3. Arrange factory displays in a ring:
   - 2 players: 5 factories  
   - 3 players: 7 factories  
   - 4 players: 9 factories  
4. Each player places their scoring marker on space 5 of the score track.  
5. Draw 10 random tiles and place them on the central supply spaces of the main board.  
6. Randomly place 4 tiles on each factory display.  
7. Place the first player token in the center of the factory ring.  
8. Fill the bag with remaining tiles; place the tower nearby.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has 3 phases:

#### Phase 1: Acquire Tiles  
Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player takes one of two actions:  
- **From a Factory**: Take all tiles of one non-wild color from a single factory. If wild tiles are present, take exactly one wild tile in addition. Remaining tiles go to the center.  
- **From the Center**: Take all tiles of one non-wild color from the center. If wilds are present, take exactly one wild tile in addition. If only wilds remain, take one.  
  - If taking from the center for the first time this round, take the first player token and move your scoring marker backward by the number of tiles taken (minimum score: 1). You become first player for Phase 2 and next round.

Repeat until all factories and center are empty.

#### Phase 2: Playing & Scoring Tiles  
Starting with the player who holds the first player token, players take turns placing tiles:  
- To place a tile on a numbered space (e.g., "4" on green star), you must have at least that many tiles (of matching color or wilds) next to your board.  
- Place one tile on the board; discard the rest used to meet the requirement into the tower.  
- At least one tile must be the actual color of the star (wilds cannot fully substitute unless used as that color).  
- On the center multicolor star: place one tile of each color; all six must be different.  
- Scoring:  
  - Earn 1 point for the placed tile.  
  - Earn 1 additional point for each adjacent connected tile (orthogonal only).  
- **Bonus Tile Rewards**:  
  - Surround a **Pillar** (4 adjacent spaces): take 1 tile from the main board.  
  - Surround a **Statue** (4 adjacent spaces): take 2 tiles (can include wilds).  
  - Surround a **Window** (2 adjacent spaces): take 3 tiles (can all be wilds).  
  - Immediately replace taken tiles from the bag.  
- Players may pass at any time.  
  - Keep up to 4 tiles (place on corner spaces of your board).  
  - Discard excess tiles into the tower; lose 1 point per discarded tile.

#### Phase 3: Preparation for Next Round  
1. Advance the round counter (if not Round 6).  
2. Refill each factory with 4 random tiles from the bag.  
   - If the bag is empty, refill it from the tower and continue.  
3. Return the first player token to the center.  
4. Move kept tiles from corners to next to your board (they are now part of your supply).

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Wild Color**: Each round, one color (shown on round track) is wild. Wild tiles can substitute for any color when fulfilling placement requirements, but must be paired with at least one actual color tile.  
  - Wild tiles can only be used as wilds in the round they are drawn.  
- **Tile Supply**: Players only use tiles they have acquired during Phase 1 or received as bonuses.  
- **Tile Placement**:  
  - Only empty spaces may be filled.  
  - Only tiles adjacent to your board may be used.  
  - Wilds must be combined with a matching color tile unless used on their own color's star or the center star.  
- **Tiebreaker**: In case of a tie, players share victory.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After Round 6:  
- **Completed Stars**:  
  - Multicolor (center): 12 points  
  - Red: 14  
  - Blue: 15  
  - Yellow: 16  
  - Orange: 17  
  - Green: 18  
  - Purple: 20  
- **Completed Number Rows**:  
  - All 1s: 4 points  
  - All 2s: 8 points  
  - All 3s: 12 points  
  - All 4s: 16 points  
- **Penalty**: Lose 1 point for each tile still on corner storage spaces.

Total all points. Highest score wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Empty Bag?** Dump all tiles from the tower into the bag and continue.  
- **No Valid Move in Phase 1?** Players must still choose a color from a factory or center if possible. If only wilds remain, take one.  
- **Can I use wilds alone on a star?** Only if placing on the star matching the wild color (e.g., purple wild on purple star) or on the center star (if color not yet placed).  
- **Can I place multiple tiles per turn?** No. One tile per turn in Phase 2.  
- **What if the scoring board runs out of tiles during bonus?** Take what you can; refill immediately from the bag. If bag is empty, refill from tower.  
- **Can I keep wilds for next round?** Yes, but they lose wild status; they are just colored tiles next round.
