## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Deception: Murder in Hong Kong*, a murder has occurred and players take on roles within a crime investigation. Most are Investigators working with the Forensic Scientist to identify the Key Evidence (Clue) and Means of Murder. However, the Murderer is hidden among them—and possibly an Accomplice. The Forensic Scientist knows the truth but can only communicate through subtle placement of bullet markers on scene tiles. The goal for Investigators is to deduce the correct Clue and Means. The Murderer and Accomplice aim to deceive and avoid detection.

### 2. Components  
- Role Cards (Murderer, Forensic Scientist, Witness, Accomplice, Lab Technician, Inside Man, Protective Detail, Consulting Detective)  
- Clue Cards (red, 4 per player)  
- Means Cards (blue, 4 per player)  
- Badge Tokens (1 per player)  
- Scene Tiles (orange) including:  
  - Location of Crime (green)  
  - Cause of Death (red)  
  - Event Tiles (with special instructions)  
- Bullet Markers (6, used by Forensic Scientist)  
- Magnifying Glass (optional, presenter marker)

### 3. Setup  
1. Determine roles based on player count:
   - 4–5 players: 1 Murderer, 1 Forensic Scientist, rest are Investigators  
   - 6–12 players: Add optional Witness and/or Accomplice  
   - Recommended expanded roles (7+ players): Lab Technician, Inside Man, Protective Detail, Consulting Detective  
2. Deal one Role Card to each player face down.  
3. The Forensic Scientist reveals their role publicly and discards their Clue and Means cards. All others keep roles secret.  
4. Each player receives:
   - 4 Clue Cards (red)  
   - 4 Means Cards (blue)  
   - 1 Badge Token  
   Display all cards face-up in front of each player, visible to others.  
5. The Forensic Scientist takes the 6 bullet markers.  
6. Shuffle Scene Tiles (excluding initial Location and Cause) into a deck. Include Event Tiles in the deck if using the variant.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

#### Phase 1: The Crime (Role Revelation)  
Conducted by the Forensic Scientist:  
1. “Everyone, close your eyes.”  
2. “Murderer and Accomplice, open your eyes.”  
3. Murderer silently points to:  
   - One Clue Card (their own)  
   - One Means Card (their own)  
4. If Accomplice is in play: they point to **another player’s** Clue and Means cards (decoy).  
5. “Murderer and Accomplice, close your eyes.”  
6. If Witness is in play:  
   - “Witness, open your eyes.”  
   - Forensic Scientist silently points to Murderer and Accomplice.  
   - “Witness, close your eyes.”  
7. If Protective Detail is in play:  
   - “Protective Detail, open your eyes.”  
   - Forensic Scientist silently points to the Witness.  
   - “Protective Detail, close your eyes.”  
8. “Everyone, open your eyes.”  

#### Phase 2: Investigation (3 Rounds)  

Each round consists of:  
- Evidence Collection  
- Discussion  
- Presentation Phase  
- (Optional) Allies Phase (Round 1 only, if Lab Technician or Inside Man in play)

##### Round 1:  
1. **Evidence Collection**  
   - Reveal:  
     - 1 Location Tile  
     - 1 Cause of Death Tile  
     - 4 random Scene Tiles  
   - One at a time, Forensic Scientist places a bullet marker on each of the 6 tiles (Location, Cause, 4 Scenes).  
   - After placing each marker, allow brief discussion.  
   - Markers cannot be moved once placed.  
2. **Allies Phase (if applicable)**  
   - “Everyone, close your eyes.”  
   - “Lab Technician, open your eyes and point to one card.”  
     - Forensic Scientist gives thumbs up (used in crime) or down (not used).  
   - “Lab Technician, close your eyes.”  
   - “Inside Man, open your eyes and point to one player.”  
     - That player loses their Badge Token.  
   - “Inside Man, close your eyes.”  
   - “Everyone, open your eyes.”  
3. **Presentation Phase**  
   - Starting with player to the left of Forensic Scientist, each player gets ~30 seconds to present theories.  
   - Use magnifying glass as speaker token.  
   - No interruptions except to **Solve the Crime**.

##### Round 2:  
1. **Evidence Collection**  
   - Draw a new Scene Tile to replace one existing Scene Tile (not Location or Cause).  
   - Place a new bullet marker on the new tile.  
   - Allow discussion.  
2. **Presentation Phase**  
   - Same as Round 1.

##### Round 3 (Final Round):  
1. **Evidence Collection**  
   - Draw another new Scene Tile to replace one existing Scene Tile.  
   - Place final bullet marker.  
   - Allow discussion.  
2. **Presentation Phase**  
   - Final round of 30-second presentations.

> **Event Tiles**: If drawn during Round 2 or 3, read the text aloud and follow instructions immediately.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Solving the Crime  
- Any player **except the Forensic Scientist** may attempt to solve the crime **once** during the game.  
- Must occur **before the last presentation in Round 3**.  
- To attempt:  
  - Announce “I want to solve the crime!”  
  - Discard your Badge Token.  
  - Point to one Clue Card and one Means Card (must be from the same player).  
- Forensic Scientist responds:  
  - “Yes” → correct, game ends immediately.  
  - “No” → incorrect, player is out of the game (no second attempt).  
- If “Yes,” the game proceeds to **Witness Reversal check** (if applicable).

#### Special Roles  
- **Accomplice**: Helps Murderer by selecting fake evidence during setup.  
- **Witness**: Learns identities of Murderer and Accomplice during setup.  
- **Lab Technician**: In Round 1, may secretly check if one card was used in the crime.  
- **Inside Man**: In Round 1, may remove one player’s Badge Token.  
- **Protective Detail**: Learns identity of Witness; helps protect them.  
- **Consulting Detective**: May either:  
  - Use Badge to solve the crime (normal), or  
  - Turn in Badge to reveal role (does not solve, but reveals allegiance).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

The game ends when:  
- A player correctly solves the crime, **or**  
- The final presentation ends without a correct solution.

#### Outcomes:  
1. **Correct Solution by Investigator**:  
   - If solved correctly:  
     - If **Witness is not in play** → Forensic Scientist and Investigators win.  
     - If **Witness is in play** → Murderer and Accomplice get **one chance** to identify the Witness.  
       - If they guess correctly → Murderer and Accomplice win (Witness eliminated).  
       - If they guess incorrectly → Investigators win.  

2. **No Correct Solution**:  
   - Murderer and Accomplice win.  

3. **False Accusation or Failed Attempt**:  
   - Player is eliminated. Game continues unless all attempts fail.  

4. **Wrong Conviction via Accomplice**:  
   - If Accomplice tricks Investigators into convicting the wrong person (i.e., pointing to their decoy cards), and a player accuses that combo, Murderer's team wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can the Forensic Scientist lie or give hints beyond bullet markers?**  
  No. They may only respond “Yes” or “No” to accusations. Any verbal hints are against the rules.  
- **Can a player solve during discussion?**  
  Yes, at any time before the last presentation.  
- **What if the new tile drawn is an Event Tile?**  
  Read it aloud and follow its instruction (e.g., swap cards, skip marker, etc.).  
- **Can the Murderer or Accomplice solve the crime?**  
  Technically yes, but doing so would reveal their intent and likely fail unless they point to themselves (which gives them away). Not strategic.  
- **What if the Inside Man removes the Forensic Scientist’s badge?**  
  Allowed. The Forensic Scientist cannot solve the crime (they aren’t allowed to anyway), but it blocks role reveals if Consulting Detective mechanics are in play.  
- **Can the Lab Technician check a card from any player?**  
  Yes, any Clue or Means card in play.
