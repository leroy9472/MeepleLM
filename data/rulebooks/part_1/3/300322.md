### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Phase 1: Remove Workers  
- **4 Players**: Remove top row of Workers from all action spaces.
- **1–3 Players**: Reveal top Quadrant Card. Remove top Workers from depicted actions. Discard card. In solo/3P, resolve "?" via die roll.

#### Phase 2: New Workers  
Each player:
1. Slide off the Farmeryard Card covering current round (keep face-down).
2. Return any Sheep on that card to supply (they die).
3. Take Workers = number shown in Community Centre window; place on just-removed Farmeryard Card (your worker supply for the round).

#### Phase 3: Income  
- **Skipped in Round 1** (no Bonus Cards in play yet).
- Activate all Bonus Cards in play (bottom effect), in any order.
- Gained resources can be used immediately (e.g., to play more Bonus Cards).

#### Phase 4: Actions  
On your turn, choose one:
- **Place Workers on Action Board**, or
- **Exchange Workers for Tools**

##### Placing Workers  
- Choose lowest unoccupied row on any action space.
- Fill it with your Workers (from your Farmeryard Card).
- Immediately resolve the action **once**, regardless of number of Workers used.

**Action Effects**:
- **Sow**: Move 1 Crop from row "1" of Field Board to an empty Field. Field row determines future yield.
- **First Player (Card Actions)**: Take required card **and** First Player token (changes next round’s starting player).
- **Sustain Sheep Life**: Move a Sheep from current Farmeryard space to next (R1→R2, etc.), or from R6 to Stables (safe).
- Other actions (contextual; depend on card draws and board state).

##### Exchange Workers for Tools  
- Return 1+ Workers to supply.
- Gain equal number of Tools (place near board).

> **End of Action Phase**: When all players have no Workers, phase ends. You must pass if no Workers remain. You cannot pass if Workers remain.

#### Phase 5: A New Card  
- Take the Farmeryard Card that held your Workers (now face-down beside Stable Board) and add it to your hand.
- You may play it immediately.

#### Phase 6: Fallow Fields  
Simultaneously:
1. Slide all **empty** Fields one row up (if possible).
2. Slide **one additional** empty Field up one more row (if possible).

#### Phase 7: Harvest  
For each planted Field:
1. Move crop marker fully left → gain that many Goods (e.g., a row-4 field yields 4 crops).
2. Move Field one row down (less efficient). Fields in row 2 cannot go lower.

#### Phase 8: Milking  
- Gain 1 Milk per Sheep on Stable Board.

#### Phase 9: Progress  
Advance Craft Buildings by paying Goods (or Jewellery).  

**To Advance a Building One Space Right**, pay:
- Goods equal to current round number, **or**
- 1 Jewellery (instead of Goods, any round)

**Constraints**:
- Some buildings restrict Goods types (e.g., only Clay and Rye).
- Some require composition (e.g., more Clay than Rye).
- You may not use Goods not allowed by the building.

**Discounts (from Round 3 onward)**:
- Pay ≥2 different Goods types → reduce cost by 1 (Cooling House, Bakehouse, Manufacture from R3; Carpentry, Brewhouse from R4).
- Pay ≥3 different Goods types → reduce cost by 2 (only Bakehouse & Manufacture, as they accept 3 types).

**Moving Boulders**:
- Cannot advance into a boulder space.
- To move a boulder: exhaust 1 Tool per space moved right.
- Must move leftmost boulder first.
- Boulders moved off right edge are removed.
- In R1–R5: Tools are refreshed next Progress Phase.
- In R6: Used Tools break (return to supply).

**Community Centre Advancement**:
- After advancing buildings, if all Craft Buildings are ≥1 space away from Centre, advance Centre to touch leftmost building.
- Increases window number → more Workers next round or more VP at end.

**Jewellery Use**:
- Spend 1 Jewellery to advance any building (bypass Goods cost).
- Can spend multiple Jewellery; still resolve boulders normally.
- Max 10 Jewellery per player.

#### Phase 10: Boulder Reset (R1–R5 only)  
Reset Boulders so:
- Left boulder is 2 spaces right of building
- Right boulder is 4 spaces right of building  
(They may not align across rows if buildings advanced unevenly.)

> If Town Hall was used this round, boulders may shift left.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after Round 6.

#### Final Scoring (Each Player)  
- **Community Centre Board**:
  - Score VP shown in window (shield icon). If no number, score 0.
  - Add 3 VP for each **3 VP icon** to the **left** of any Craft Building.
- **Sheep**: 1 VP per Sheep in Stables.
- **Jewellery**: 1 VP per remaining Jewellery.
- **Fields + Goods + Tools**:
  - Fields: Value = row number (e.g., row 4 = 4 pts). Total all field values.
  - Goods: Total all Goods (all types).
  - Tools: Total Tools in possession.
  - Sum all three → divide by 5 → score that many VP (round down? → source says "equal number", assume integer division).
- **Cards**: Sum VP symbols on **played** cards in front of you. Hand cards do not count.

> **Win Condition**: Highest VP wins. Tiebreaker: highest sum of Fields (by row), Goods, and Tools.
