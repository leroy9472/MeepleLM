## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Players are Elvalands, war chiefs of the Dwarven Kingdom, tasked by the King to assemble the bravest army to defeat Fafnir, a fearsome dragon threatening the realm. The goal is to build an army of dwarves from five classes (Warriors, Hunters, Miners, Blacksmiths, Explorers) and score the highest Final Bravery Value at the end of two Ages. The Elvaland with the highest score wins the honor of facing the dragon.

### 2. Components
- 87 Dwarf cards (18 Warriors, 16 Hunters, 16 Miners, 20 Blacksmiths, 16 Explorers, 1 special Blacksmith Distinction card)
- 21 Hero cards
- 5 Distinction cards
- 5 individual player boards
- 6 Gems (5 basic: 1–5; 1 special: 6)
- 60 gold coins (25 basic red coins: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5 ×5; 34 Royal Treasure yellow coins: 2–25)
- 3 Tavern signs (Laughing Goblin, Dancing Dragon, Shining Horse)
- 3 Gem Trade Markers
- 1 Royal Treasure (coin holder)
- 4 card holders
- 1 scoring pad

### 3. Setup
1. **Player Setup**: Give each Elvaland a player board, 5 basic coins (0, 2, 3, 4, 5), and 1 random basic gem (based on player count).
2. **Gems**:
   - 5 players: use all 5 gems (1–5)
   - 4 players: use gems 2–5
   - 3 players: use gems 3–5
   - 2 players: use gems 4–5
3. **Taverns**: Place the 3 tavern signs in order: Goblin (top), Dragon, Horse (bottom). Place a Gem Trade Marker next to each.
4. **Cards**: Shuffle Age 1 and Age 2 decks separately. Place Hero and Distinction cards in card holders with left edges visible.
5. **Royal Treasure**: Assemble and place in center. For 2–3 players, remove two each of coins 7, 9, and 11.
6. **Dwarf Entrance**: Place X face-up Dwarf cards from the current Age deck under each tavern. X = number of Elvalands (3 for 2 players).
7. **5-Player Game**: Include cards marked with a "5" in the bottom right corner in the decks.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each Age consists of 3 turns (4–5 players) or 4 turns (2–3 players). Each turn has two phases:

#### Turn Preparation
1. **Dwarves Entrance**: Refill each tavern with X face-up cards from the current Age deck.
2. **Bids**: Simultaneously, each Elvaland places 1 coin face down on each of the 3 tavern locations on their board. The remaining 2 coins go face down in the pouch.

#### Tavern Resolution (Repeat for each tavern: Goblin → Dragon → Horse)
1. **Bid Revelation**:
   - Reveal only the coin on the current tavern.
   - Determine turn order by highest coin value. Tiebreaker: higher gem value.
2. **Active Elvaland Turn** (in bid order):
   - **Choose a Card**: Take one card from the tavern. 
     - Dwarf card: Place in corresponding army column (right of board), ranks visible.
     - Royal Offering (+X): Immediately transform one of your coins (see below).
   - **Recruit Hero**: If placing the card completes a line (one rank from each of the 5 classes), recruit a Hero. You may recruit if number of complete lines = number of Heroes + 1.
   - **Coin Trade (if 0 played)**: Reveal pouch coins, sum them. Discard higher coin, take a coin from the Royal Treasure equal to the sum (or next higher if unavailable). Basic (red) coins are removed from the game; Royal Treasure (yellow) coins return to the treasury.
3. **Trading Gems**:
   - After all Elvalands have taken a card, trade gems among those tied for the same bid value:
     - 2 tied: swap gems.
     - 3 tied: lowest and highest gems swap; middle keeps its gem.
     - 4 tied: lowest and highest swap; two middle swap.
     - 5 tied: same as 4, middle gem does not swap.
   - The special gem 6 is never traded.

After resolving all 3 taverns, pick up all coins and begin the next turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Hero Recruitment**: Triggered by completing a line (1 rank of each class). Heroes provide points or abilities.
- **Coin Transformation**: Use Royal Offering cards or Distinction rewards to add +X to a coin. Discard the old coin, take the new value from the treasury (next higher if unavailable). The 0 coin cannot be transformed.
- **Discarding Coins**: Basic (red) coins are removed from the game. Royal Treasure (yellow) coins return to the treasury.
- **Hero Abilities**:
  - **Dwerg Brothers**: Score 13/40/81/108/135 based on number recruited.
  - **Skaa**: +17 points.
  - **Astrid**: + value of highest coin.
  - **Grid**: +7 points; immediately transform one coin +7.
  - **Uline**: +9 points; keep coins in hand, choose after others reveal; no pouch.
  - **Ylud**: + variable points based on final column (Warrior: 7, Explorer: 11, Miner: 1, Hunter/Blacksmith: per chart). Place after Age 1 and before final scoring.
  - **Thrud**: +13 points; place in army, never covered; move to Command Zone before final scoring.
  - **Kraal**: 2 ranks; +7 and 0 points to Warriors.
  - **Tarah**: 1 rank; +14 points to Warriors.
  - **Dagda**: 3 ranks; place in Hunters; discard last card from two other columns.
  - **Bonfur**: 3 ranks; place in Blacksmiths; discard last card from another column.
  - **Zoral**: 3 ranks; +1,0,0 to Miners (adds 1 to sum, 3 to rank count).
  - **Lokdur**: 1 rank; +3 to Miner sum.
  - **Hourya**: 1 rank; +20 to Explorers; requires 5 Explorer ranks to recruit.
  - **Idunn**: 1 rank; +7 +2 per Explorer rank (including self).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End of Age 1 – Troop Evaluation**:
After the Age 1 deck is exhausted:
- Award Distinction cards for strict majority in each class (ranks, not points):
  - **Warriors (King's Hand)**: Transform one coin +5.
  - **Hunters (Hunting Master)**: Replace 0 coin with special 3-value coin (cannot be transformed).
  - **Miners (Crown Jeweler)**: Take special gem 6 (+3 VP, wins all ties, never traded).
  - **Blacksmiths (King's Great Armorer)**: Add special 2-rank Blacksmith card.
  - **Explorers (Pioneer of the Kingdom)**: Draw 3 from Age 2 deck; keep 1, shuffle others back. If not won, discard top Age 2 card.
- Award in order: Warrior, Hunter, Miner, Blacksmith, Explorer. Ties: no card awarded.

**End of Age 2 – Final Scoring**:
Total Final Bravery Value:
- Bravery Value of each class:
  - **Warriors**: Sum of Bravery Points + highest coin value (if majority; all tied players add their highest coin).
  - **Hunters**: Number of cards squared.
  - **Miners**: Sum of Bravery Points × number of ranks.
  - **Blacksmiths**: Mathematical sequence (+3, +4, +5, ...); use player board chart.
  - **Explorers**: Sum of Bravery Points.
- Bravery Value of neutral Heroes in Command Zone.
- Total value of all 5 coins.
- Special gem 6: +3 VP.
- **Tie**: Shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hero Recruitment Timing**: Bonfur and Dagda discard cards; you cannot recruit a new Hero until you replace them and form a new line.
- **Uline Timing**: Activates immediately. Take back unresolved coins and pouch coins into hand.
- **Ylud and Thrud Timing**: After last tavern of Age 2, move Ylud first (may trigger Hero recruitment), then move Thrud to Command Zone.
- **Coin Transformation During Tavern**: Original bid value determines tie; transformation does not affect turn order.
- **Unavailable Coins**: If desired coin not in treasury, take next higher; if none, take next lower.
- **0 Coin**: Cannot be transformed. With Hunting Master, it is replaced and no longer exists.
