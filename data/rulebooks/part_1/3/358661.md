## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Andromeda's Edge: Escalation introduces a new threat to the galaxy — the Nethervoid, a crack in space formed by dark energy, from which the Void Drake emerges. The Void Drake seeks to draw beings into eternal darkness. Meanwhile, Unity, a galactic empire, arrives to impose order, tracking players to Andromeda’s Edge. Players must establish dominance before Unity takes control. The objective is to score the most victory points (VP) by advancing on progress tracks, building developments, claiming moons, and defeating raiders.

2. Components  
- 6 Transports (1 per player/Unity color)  
- The Conn Token

3. Setup

- Include new factions during selection.  
- Mix 4 neutral ship upgrades into upgrade stacks.  
- Place Nethervoid tile in designated spot on board.  
- Place Void Drake on Nethervoid.  
- Shuffle Shadows of the Void event deck and use with Nethervoid.  
- For ancient moons: Shuffle all 12 nebula moons (6 pink, 6 teal), place 2 in each nebula. Players may claim only 1 per launch.  
- For solo mode: Set up as 2-player game. Unity uses Unity Station Mat and 1 Commander Card (Level 1, 2, or 3). Assign unused color to Unity.  
  - Place Unity ships on Unity Station.  
  - Place Unity leaders on Alliance Bases; remaining leader becomes Command Marker on Command Wheel.  
  - Advance Unity progress track markers per Commander bonuses.  
  - Place 5 Corrupted Leaders (from unused color) on Unity Station.  
  - Shuffle Unity action decks (I, II, III), reveal top card of each.  
  - Shuffle Unity conflict and upgrade decks, place beside station.  
  - Place Unity probe on top-leftmost region.  
  - Replace 15 development cards with solo variants.  
  - Replace certain event cards with solo versions (see rulebook).  
  - Unity receives 2 secret destiny cards (scores best one).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Turn Order: Players take turns in clockwise order. The player with The Conn goes last; Unity acts after them. In solo, human player takes The Conn and acts first.  
- Each turn: Either Launch a Ship or Return to Station.  
- Launch: Move a ship to a region. First launch must be unoccupied (unless ship has Attack). Subsequent launches must be within range of existing ships.  
- Activate Region: Claim moon, build development, advance event, etc.  
- Raider Strike: If raider in range, it moves to active region and battle occurs.  
- Battle: Escalation → Diplomacy → Preparations → Roll Dice → Outcome.  
- Return to Station: Return all ships, activate modules, prepare for next turn.  
- Unity Turn: After player with Conn, Unity rolls D6 to determine action, launches ship, resolves region, recruits, develops, repairs, returns.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Launching: Ships must obey range and Voyage rules. Nebula requires Voyage.  
- Modules: Activate during Return to Station. Science modules require Primary Reactor activation. Industry modules form half-moon pairs.  
- Moons: Claim during region activation. Slot into modules or discard for resources. Max 4 claimed moons at turn end.  
- Raiders:  
  - C-Class: Void Drake starts on Nethervoid.  
  - S-Class: Multiple can exist; swarm together when one strikes.  
  - Other classes: One per type; placed via events.  
- Unity Mechanics:  
  - Does not use resources; gains tactics cards instead.  
  - Ships ignore launch restrictions (can occupy same region).  
  - Science Vessel gains leftmost nebula moon when launched.  
  - Upgrades replaced with Unity Upgrade Tokens (ongoing or one-time).  
  - Repair: Always repairs module first; if none, gains 1 VP.  
  - Develop: Builds on leftmost undeveloped planet with transport. Gains module or repair per development.  
  - Scoring: Commerce track VP based on tactics cards (up to 15). Relics score 2/5/9/14/20 VP for 1–5.  
- Nethervoid:  
  - Launching to it: Roll battle dice, choose one result. Not a battle. Energy may be diverted.  
  - Grants benefit based on chosen die (1–6).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when any player reaches terminus (60 or 70 VP). That player finishes turn; all others take one more turn.  
- Final Scoring:  
  - Progress Tracks: VP at current position.  
  - Developments: 5/7/10 VP each based on level (L1/L2/L3).  
  - Damaged Modules: -2 VP each.  
  - Vault: VP per unspent resource (including tactics cards) based on Commerce track.  
  - Civilization Modules: Endgame VP as printed.  
  - Leaders: 1 VP each on station.  
  - Destiny Cards: Score best of two (Unity), or as drawn.  
  - Vortexes/Quasars: 1 VP per adjacent development.  
  - Relics: 2/5/9/14/20 VP for 1–5 relic icons (from modules and moons).  
- Unity Scoring: Same as players, plus:  
  - 2 VP per moon token.  
  - 3 VP per discovery/supremacy token.  
  - Relics as above.  
  - Destroys damaged modules for -2 VP each.  
- Tiebreakers: Most station modules → most resources.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Unity Probe: Moves to active region whenever player launches to planet or Alliance Base (not nebula).  
- Unity Launch: If no ships in rolled section, Unity Returns to Station.  
- Unity Development: Must have transport and leaders. Builds leftmost possible.  
- Unity Battle: Heavy Cruiser has infinite range. Uses conflict deck for diplomacy.  
- Module Activation: Cannot activate damaged, occupied, or energy-blocked modules.  
- Moon Slotting: Null moon (⌀) allows free activation. Repair moons cannot be inputs.  
- Event Resolution: Place region → place marker → finish turn → resolve event (VP → place raider → effect → reset).  
- Diplomacy Cards: "Abandon Post" ends battle if only two sides; continues if third party remains.  
- S-Class Raiders: All in range join battle; targeting = number present. Only one scrapped if defeated.  
- Repair Action: If nothing to repair, gain 1 VP.  
- Civilization Track: Upon reaching limit, draw cards to new hand size.
