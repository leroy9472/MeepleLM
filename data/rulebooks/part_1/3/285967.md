   - God Dashboard, Merged God Dashboard
   - 15 Ankh tokens (6 placed on bottom row of dashboard; 9 in personal pool)
   - 7 Battle cards
   - 1 Follower token (rest in general supply)
   - Player Aid card
   - God-specific tokens (if applicable)
3. **Determine First Player**: Randomly choose or assign (e.g., to player with most cats). Play proceeds clockwise.
4. **Devotion Track**: In reverse player order, each player places one Ankh token on the bottom space of the Devotion track, forming a stack (first player’s token on top).
5. **Action Markers**: Place 4 Action markers on Central Dashboard starting spaces (based on player count).
6. **Event Marker**: Place on first space of Event track.
7. **Choose Scenario**: Select a valid scenario from the scenario book. Set up monuments, Conflict Order tokens, and camels as specified.
8. **Place Figures**: Position god, warriors, and Ankh tokens on board as per scenario (player #1 = first player).
9. **Guardians**: Randomly choose one Level 1, 2, and 3 Guardian card. Place Guardian figures next to cards:
   - 2 players: 1 figure per level
   - 3 players: 2 figures per level
   - 4–5 players: all available figures (3 for small-base, 2 for large-base)
10. **Pharaoh Expansion (Optional)**:
    - Place Palace Dashboard next to Central Dashboard.
    - Shuffle Political Deck; place face-down. Draw 3 Political cards face-up.
    - Each player places 1 Priest in Chamber of Law; 2 in pool.
    - Place 5 Sphinx tokens near War Room.
    - Choose Pharaoh card and set up accordingly.
11. **Additional Rules**: Follow any scenario-specific setup instructions.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Players take turns clockwise.
- On a turn, perform 1 or 2 actions:
  1. Choose and resolve first action (move Action marker right).
  2. If no event triggered, choose and resolve second action (must be lower row on dashboard).
- If an action triggers an event (marker reaches end of track):
  - Resolve the action.
  - Advance Event marker and resolve event.
  - Reset Action marker to starting position.
  - Turn ends (no second action).
- After all actions and events are resolved, turn passes clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Actions
- **Move Figures**: Move each of your figures (god, warrior, guardian) up to 3 spaces. Can pass through occupied, water, or camel-divided spaces. Must end on empty non-water space.
- **Summon Figure**: Place 1 figure (warrior or guardian) from your pool on an empty non-water space adjacent to your figure or controlled monument (same region).
- **Gain Followers**: Gain 1 Follower per monument (yours or neutral) adjacent to any of your figures.
- **Unlock Ankh Power**: Move the leftmost Ankh token from the bottom row of your dashboard up to an Ankh power in the same column. Pay Followers equal to power level (1, 2, or 3). Must unlock Level 1 powers before Level 2, etc.
  - If a Guardian symbol is revealed, gain control of one Guardian figure of that level (if available). Attach colored base and add to pool.

#### Events
- **Control Monument**: Gain control of one neutral monument adjacent to your figure. If none, take opponent’s adjacent monument.
- **Camel Caravan**: Place up to 6 camels to split a region. Both new regions must be ≥6 spaces. Assign Conflict Order tokens: keep existing in one, place lowest-numbered from supply in the other. May swap one of the two with any other token on the board.
- **Conflict**:
  - Player who triggered event gains Battle Tiebreaker token (face-up).
  - Resolve regions in order of Conflict Order tokens (lowest to highest).
  - For each region:
    - **No figures**: Ignore.
    - **One player**: That player dominates. Gains 1 Devotion for dominating + 1 per monument majority (temples, pyramids, obelisks) they control in the region.
    - **Two or more players**: Battle occurs.

#### Battle Resolution
1. **Select and Reveal Cards**: Each player in battle chooses 1 Battle card face-down. Reveal simultaneously.
2. **Build Monument**: Resolve in reverse Devotion order. Pay 3 Followers to build a monument in region.
3. **Resolve Plague**: Resolve all Plague of Locusts cards (blind bid Followers; highest bidder saves figures).
4. **Monument Majority**: In reverse Devotion order, gain 1 Devotion per monument type majority (must have figure in region).
5. **Battle Resolution**:
   - Calculate strength: 1 per figure + card bonus + God/Ankh/Guardian effects.
   - Highest strength wins: gains 1 Devotion, kills all enemy warriors and guardians.
   - Tie: if tied player has Battle Tiebreaker (face-up), may use it (flip face-down) to win. If not used, all lose; all figures killed.
   - Gods can never be killed.
6. **Post-Battle Effects**:
   - **Magnanimous**: If lost with ≥2 figures, gain 2 Devotion.
   - **Miracle**: Gain 1 Devotion per figure killed (in battle or plague).
   - **Worshipful**: Pay 2 Followers to gain 1 Devotion.
   - **Bountiful**: If in red section of Devotion track, gain +1 Devotion per gain instance.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Conditions** (game ends immediately if any met):
  1. A god reaches the top space of the Devotion track.
  2. After 4th Conflict, only one god remains (if all eliminated, all lose).
  3. After 5th Conflict, highest Devotion wins (if tied, player on top of stack wins).
- **Devotion Gains**:
  - Control monuments (via actions, events, or scenario).
  - Dominate regions (1 Devotion + 1 per majority).
  - Win battles (1 Devotion, + bonuses).
  - Ankh powers and card effects.

#### Merging Gods (3+ players)
- After 3rd Conflict, the two gods with least Devotion merge.
- Steps:
  1. Lower-merging god gives Followers to higher-merging god.
  2. Higher-merging god may take lower’s Guardians (if bases available).
  3. Destroy lower’s monuments; remove god, warriors, battle cards.
  4. Stack Devotion tokens (higher on top).
  5. Attach large base to higher god’s figure.
  6. Lower-merging god matches Ankh powers of higher.
  7. Both players share dashboards, pools, and play as one team.
- **Merged Gameplay**: Each player takes 1 action per turn (total 2 actions). Share all resources. Decide jointly; higher god breaks ties.

#### Forgotten Gods
- After 4th Conflict, any god in red section of Devotion track is eliminated.
- Remove all components. If only one god remains, they win. If all eliminated, all lose.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Ties in Devotion**: Token on top has higher priority.
- **Multiple Devotion Gains**: Resolve in reverse Devotion order (least to most).
- **Unable to Perform Action**: Still move Action marker. No benefit gained.

- **Guardian Summoning**: Only possible via Unlock Ankh Power revealing symbol.
- **Battle Tiebreaker**: Can only be used once per Conflict; must be face-up.
