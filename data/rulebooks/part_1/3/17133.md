### 1. Lore & Objective
In the age of railroading, players are railroad barons competing to build networks, deliver goods, and expand their influence across North America. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) by delivering goods, completing major routes, fulfilling secret objectives, and managing resources.

### 2. Components
- Game board: Combined Eastern and Western USA with new cities (Vancouver, Calgary, Regina, Winnipeg, Thunder Bay, Montreal, Ensenada)
- Goods cubes: 50 each of Yellow, Blue, Purple, Red, Black
- White cubes (Settlers): 1 per grey city, 2 per blue/yellow/purple/black city, 3 per red city
- Brown cubes (Raw Materials): 25
- Track tiles and player locomotives
- Engine placards (train levels 1–15+)
- Railroad Operations Cards (custom deck from all game versions)
- Rail Baron Cards: Eastern USA, Western USA, North America, and World cards
- Empty City Markers
- Score/income track
- Bond certificates and money

### 3. Setup
- **Goods Setup**: Place cubes on Eastern USA cities as normal. Western cities start empty.
- **Cubes**: Use 50 each of Yellow, Blue, Purple, Red, and Black cubes. Place White cubes (Settlers) beside the board. Place 25 Brown cubes (Raw Materials) beside the board.
- **Baron Cards**: Remove Canadian-flagged Baron cards. Give each player two of each type (Eastern USA, Western USA, North America, World). Each player chooses one of each type to keep, discards the rest. Final hand: four baron cards.
- **Operations Deck**: Create a custom deck using cards from all game versions (use opaque sleeves). Remove traditional first-delivery, four-color, three-link, and level-4 train cards—they are now on the scoring sheet. Set out face-up cards equal to 2 × number of players.
- **Trains**: Players start with Level 1 train. Higher levels (beyond 8) use multiple train cards to sum speed.
- **New Cities**: Add grey city tiles for Vancouver, Calgary, Regina, Winnipeg, Thunder Bay, Montreal, Ensenada (marked with X on hexes). Remove Western Link tiles.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn has three phases:
1. **First Player Auction**: Players bid for turn order. Winner pays bid to bank and takes First Player Marker.
2. **Player Action Rounds**: Three rounds. Each player takes one action per round:
   - Build Track (up to 4 tiles)
   - Urbanize
   - Upgrade Engine
   - Deliver One Goods Cube
   - Select Railroad Operations Card
3. **Income and Dividends**:
   - Collect income based on score track position.
   - Pay $1,000 per bond issued.
   - Draw one new Operations Card.
   - Remove incomplete links.

After Phase 3, advance turn marker and repeat.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Settlers (White Cubes)**:
  - When a city in Eastern USA is emptied, place White cubes:
    - Grey City: 1 White Cube
    - Blue/Yellow/Purple/Black City: 2 White Cubes
    - Red City: 3 White Cubes
  - When the last White Cube is removed from an Eastern city, place an Empty City Marker.
  - White cubes count for Operations Cards and are worth +1 VP when delivered.
  - Delivering to Western cities: First delivery of a White Cube "populates" the city. White cubes remain in Western cities and cannot be removed.
    - Grey Western City: Accepts 1 White Cube
    - Blue/Yellow/Purple/Black Western City: Accepts 2 White Cubes
    - Red Western City: Accepts 3 White Cubes
  - Deliveries must stop at first Western city accepting settlers.

- **The West Opens Up**:
  - When the 6th White Cube is delivered to the West, the West officially opens at the end of that turn.
  - Add 25 Brown cubes to the bag (Raw Materials). These can only originate in the West and be delivered to red cities in the East.
  - Place goods on all unpopulated Western cities.
  - Settler deliveries continue as before.
  - When a Brown cube is delivered, it is removed from the game (not returned to bag). Player keeps it. Worth +2 VP.
  - Bonus for most Brown cubes delivered at game end.

- **Transcontinental Bonuses**:
  - First to connect East and West Coasts: 20 VP
  - Second: 15 VP
  - Third: 10 VP
  - Fourth: 5 VP
  - East Coast Cities: Boston, Providence, New Haven, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Norfolk, Richmond, Wilmington, Charleston, Savannah, Jacksonville, Mobile, New Orleans
  - West Coast Cities: Tacoma, Portland, Eureka, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego

- **Canadian and Mexico Bonuses**:
  - Connect any 4 of 7 Canadian cities: 12, 10, 8, 6 VP (for 1st–4th)
  - First to connect USA, Mexico, and Canada: 10 VP

- **Bond Buy Back**:
  - After The West opens, players may return bonds to the bank.
  - Cost: 1st bond = 2 VP, 2nd = 3 VP, 3rd = 4 VP, etc.
  - Example: Returning 4 bonds costs 2+3+4+5 = 14 VP.

- **Train Costs**:
  - Level 2: $5,000
  - Levels 3–4: $10,000
  - Levels 5–6: $15,000
  - Levels 7–8: $20,000
  - Levels 9–10: $25,000
  - Levels 11–12: $30,000
  - Levels 13–14: $35,000
  - Level 15+: $40,000

- **Operations Card Refresh Rate**:
  - 1–4 players: Add 1 card
  - 5–6 players: Add 2 cards

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End**: Triggered when 20 Empty City Markers are on the board. Finish the current turn, then play one more full turn.
- **Final Scoring**:
  - Score each of the four Rail Baron cards if fulfilled.
  - Award bonus VP for most Brown cubes delivered.
  - Subtract 1 VP per bond owned.
  - Each point on score track = 1 VP.
- **Winning**: Highest total VP wins. Tiebreakers: most links, then most money.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you deliver to a city that only has a White cube?** No—White cubes are not goods. Only after a city is populated (via settler delivery) can goods be delivered.
- **Can Brown cubes be delivered to Western cities?** No. Brown cubes can only be delivered to red cities in the Eastern USA.
- **Can you deliver a goods cube through a Western city before it’s populated?** No. Only White cubes can be delivered to unpopulated Western cities.
- **Do White cubes in Western cities count toward emptying a city?** No. Western cities are never emptied of White cubes. They remain as population markers.
- **Can you build in the West before it opens?** Yes, but it’s risky—no return on investment until the West opens.
