### 1. Lore & Objective
Zombicide: Black Plague is a cooperative board game set in a medieval fantasy world overrun by zombies. Players control Survivors who must complete mission-specific objectives while surviving waves of zombies, including powerful Abominations and Necromancers. The game is won by completing all Quest objectives. It is lost if all Survivors are eliminated or if too many Necromancers escape while six or more Zombie Spawn tokens are on the board.

### 2. Components
- Survivor miniatures, ID cards, and dashboards
- Zombie miniatures (Walkers, Runners, Fatties, Abominations, Necromancers, etc.)
- Equipment cards (Melee, Ranged, Magic, Enchantments, Vault Artifacts)
- Zombie Spawn cards and tokens (including Necromancer Spawn tokens)
- Objective tokens, Noise tokens, Vault tokens, Dragon Bile, and Torch cards
- Dice, wound trackers, and player color-coded tokens

### 3. Setup
1. Choose a Quest and place map tiles, doors, objectives, and tokens as specified.
2. Assign Survivors to players; each receives a miniature, ID card, dashboard, colored base, and 5 colored trackers.
3. Set the experience tracker to 0, wound tracker to 0, and skill tracker to the top (Blue) skill.
4. Set aside "Starting Equipment" (gray back) and "Vault" (blue back) cards.
5. Distribute Starting Equipment among Survivors (at least one card each).
6. Shuffle Equipment and Zombie decks; place them near the board.
7. Place Survivors on starting zones per Quest.
8. Choose the first player and give them the first player token.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game round proceeds in three phases:
1. **Players' Phase**: Players take turns activating their Survivors in clockwise order. Each Survivor has 3 Actions (more at higher levels). Actions include Move, Search, Open Door, Trade, Combat, Make Noise, etc.
2. **Zombies' Phase**:
   - **Activation**: Zombies either Attack (if in a Survivor's Zone) or Move toward Survivors or Noise. Resolve all Attacks first, then Moves. Runners get 2 Actions; Wolfz and Abominalphas get 3.
   - **Spawn**: Draw one Zombie card per Spawn Zone (clockwise order), spawning zombies based on the highest Danger Level among active Survivors.
3. **End Phase**: Remove all Noise tokens, pass the first player token clockwise, and reload all reloadable weapons.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Actions**: Each Survivor has 3 Actions per turn. Key Actions:
  - *Move*: 1 Zone per Action. Moving out of a Zone with Zombies costs +1 Action per Zombie.
  - *Search*: Only in building Zones with no Zombies. Draw 1 Equipment card. Only 1 Search per turn.
  - *Open Door*: Requires a melee weapon with "Open a door" symbol. Spawns zombies if opening a building for the first time.
  - *Combat*:
    - *Melee*: Attack Zombies in the same Zone. Assign hits freely.
    - *Ranged/Magic*: Attack a Zone within range and Line of Sight. Hits assigned by Targeting Priority: (1) Murder of Crowz, (2) Walker/NPC/Deadeye Walker, (3) Fatty/Abomination, (4) Runner, (5) Wolf, (6) Necromancer. Misses cause Friendly Fire.
  - *Make Noise*: Place a Noise token in the Zone.
- **Line of Sight (LoS)**: Orthogonal only. On streets, unlimited until blocked. In buildings, 1 Zone through openings. Towers allow LoS over buildings.
- **Zombie Movement**: Zombies move toward the noisiest Zone with Survivors in LoS. If none, toward the noisiest Zone. Shortest path; split groups equally if multiple paths.
- **Necromancers**:
  - When spawned, add a Necromancer Spawn token and immediately spawn zombies.
  - Moves toward the nearest non-Necromancer Spawn Zone if no Survivors are present.
  - Escapes when it activates on a Spawn Zone, replacing its token with a standard one.
  - Game is lost if a Necromancer escapes with 6+ Spawn tokens on board.
  - Killing a Necromancer allows removal of one Spawn token.
- **Dragon Fire**: Discard Dragon Bile to place a pool at Range 0–1. Discard Torch to ignite it, killing all in the Zone. Survivor who ignites gains XP.
- **Vaults**: Special rooms accessed via Vault doors. No LoS through open doors. Can't be Searched. Survivor spends 1 Action to take a Vault Artifact.
- **Skills**: Gained at Danger Levels: Yellow (7 XP), Orange (19 XP), Red (43 XP). Examples:
  - *Blitz*: After killing last Zombie in a Zone, gain 1 free Move Action.
  - *Ironclad*: Ignore Wounds from specified Zombie types.
  - *Lucky*: Re-roll all dice once per Action or Armor roll.
  - *Spellcaster*: Gain 1 extra Action for Magic or Enchantment.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Experience**: Gain 1 XP per Zombie killed (5 for Abominations). Reach 7 XP for Yellow, 19 for Orange, 43 for Red.
- **Winning**: Complete all Quest objectives.
- **Losing**: All Survivors eliminated, or a Necromancer escapes with 6+ Spawn tokens on board, or Quest-specific loss condition.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Friendly Fire**: Misses from Ranged/Magic Actions hit Survivors in target Zone. Armor rolls can block.
- **Dual Weapons**: Two identical weapons with Dual symbol can be used in one Action, doubling dice.
- **Out of Miniatures**: If no more miniatures of a type, all existing ones of that type get an extra Activation.
- **Extra Activation Cards**: Instead of spawning, all Zombies of the indicated type immediately activate.
- **Double Spawn Cards**: Skip spawning; next Spawn Zone draws two cards.
- **Tough Skill**: Ignore first Wound from each Zombie per Zombies' Phase.
- **Rotten Skill**: If no Combat Action or Noise, Survivor is ignored by Zombies until next Combat or Noise.
