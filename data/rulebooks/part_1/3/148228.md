## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
In Splendor, you are a wealthy merchant during the Renaissance, seeking to amass prestige by acquiring mines, transportation, and artisans to produce fine jewels. Your goal is to attract the attention of influential Nobles and become the most prestigious merchant.

The objective is to be the first to reach 15 or more Prestige Points. At that point, the game enters its final round—once all players have taken an equal number of turns, the player with the most Prestige Points wins.

In the event of a tie, the player who has purchased the fewest Development Cards is declared the winner.

2. **Components**  
- 90 Development Cards:  
  - 40 Level 1 cards (Green)  
  - 30 Level 2 cards (Brown)  
  - 20 Level 3 cards (Blue)  
- 40 Gem Tokens:  
  - 7 each of Diamond (White), Sapphire (Blue), Emerald (Green), Ruby (Red), Onyx (Black)  
  - 5 Gold Tokens (Yellow, wild)  
- 10 Noble Tiles: Each worth 3 Prestige Points and requires a specific combination of card bonuses to claim  
- 1 First Player Marker (implied)

3. **Setup**  
- **Card Layout**:  
  - Shuffle each level deck (Level 1, 2, 3) separately.  
  - Place them in a column from bottom to top: Level 1 (Green), Level 2 (Brown), Level 3 (Blue).  
  - Reveal the top 4 cards from each deck, placing them face up in a row to the right of their respective decks. Maintain 4 face-up cards per level throughout the game.  

- **Noble Tiles**:  
  - Shuffle all 10 Noble Tiles.  
  - Reveal a number of Nobles equal to the number of players + 1.  
    - 2 players: 3 Nobles  
    - 3 players: 4 Nobles  
    - 4 players: 5 Nobles  
  - Place them face up above the card display. Return the rest to the box.  

- **Gem Tokens**:  
  - Form supply stacks for each gem color.  
  - Adjust quantities based on player count:  
    - 4 players: 7 of each colored gem, 5 Gold  
    - 3 players: 5 of each colored gem, 5 Gold  
    - 2 players: 4 of each colored gem, 5 Gold  
  - Gold tokens are always used in full (5 available).  

- **Starting Player**:  
  - The youngest player goes first and takes the First Player Marker. Play proceeds clockwise.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
On your turn, perform **exactly one** of the following four actions:

1. **Take 3 Gems of Different Colors**  
   - Take one gem token from three different colors.  
   - If fewer than 3 colors are available, take one of each available color.  
   - Cannot take Gold with this action.

2. **Take 2 Gems of the Same Color**  
   - Take 2 gems of one color.  
   - Only allowed if at least 4 gems of that color were in the supply before taking.  
   - Cannot take Gold with this action.

3. **Reserve a Development Card and Take 1 Gold Token**  
   - Choose any face-up card from the display or draw the top card from any deck (face-down, kept private).  
   - Place the reserved card in your hand (private).  
   - Take 1 Gold token if available. If none are available, you still reserve the card but do not receive Gold.  
   - You may hold up to 3 reserved cards. If you already have 3, you cannot take this action.  
   - Reserved cards cannot be discarded; they remain until purchased or the game ends.

4. **Purchase a Development Card**  
   - Buy either:  
     - A face-up card from the display  
     - A reserved card from your hand  
   - Pay the cost shown in the lower-left corner using your gem tokens.  
   - Gold tokens act as wilds and can substitute for any gem color.  
   - Return paid tokens to the supply.  
   - Place the purchased card face up in front of you.  
   - Cards are grouped by color (bonus type), staggered so Prestige Points and bonuses remain visible.

**After Action Resolution (in order):**  
- **Replace Cards**: If a card was taken from the display (purchased or reserved), draw the top card from its deck to refill the row. Maintain 4 face-up cards per level if possible.  
- **Claim Noble (Automatic)**: At the end of your turn, check if you meet the requirements of any face-up Noble Tile (based on the number and type of card bonuses you have, not gem tokens). If so, claim one such Noble—only one per turn. Place it in your play area; it grants 3 Prestige Points and is permanent.  
- **Token Limit Check**: You may possess more than 10 tokens during your turn, but at the end, if you have more than 10 (gems + gold), return excess tokens of your choice to the supply.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Card Bonuses**:  
  - Each purchased Development Card displays a gem symbol in the top-right corner.  
  - This acts as a permanent discount of 1 gem of that color when purchasing future cards.  
  - Example: 3 Ruby bonuses mean you pay 3 fewer Ruby gems when buying a card.  
  - If bonuses exceed cost, no tokens are gained; you simply pay nothing.

- **Gold Tokens**:  
  - Act as wilds in purchases.  
  - Only obtainable by reserving a card (if available) or possibly via 5–6 player variants (not in base).  
  - Count toward the 10-token limit.

- **Reserved Cards**:  
  - Private, up to 3 allowed.  
  - Can be purchased later using standard payment rules.  
  - No penalty at game end for un-purchased reserved cards.

- **Nobles**:  
  - Each requires a specific combination of card bonuses (e.g., 3 Sapphire, 2 Emerald).  
  - Claimed automatically at end of turn if requirements are met.  
  - Only one per turn, even if multiple Nobles are eligible.  
  - Once claimed, removed from the pool and cannot be taken by others.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- **Game End Trigger**:  
  - When any player reaches **15 or more Prestige Points** at the end of their turn, the game enters its final round.  
  - All other players take one more turn so that everyone has had an equal number of turns.

- **Final Scoring**:  
  - Total Prestige Points = Sum of:  
    - Prestige Points on purchased Development Cards  
    - 3 points for each claimed Noble Tile  
  - Score must be publicly visible.

- **Winning**:  
  - Highest total Prestige Points wins.  
  - Tiebreaker: Fewest total purchased Development Cards.  
  - If still tied, players share victory (per official rules).

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can I take 2 gems if only 3 are left?**  
  No. You may only take 2 of the same color if **at least 4 were present before** taking.  

- **Can I take Gold when taking gems?**  
  No. Gold can only be obtained by reserving a card (if available).  

- **What if I have 3 reserved cards and no action is possible?**  
  You must show your 3 reserved cards to prove you cannot reserve again, then pass your turn (per official clarification).  

- **Can I claim a Noble before purchasing a card on my turn?**  
  No. Nobles are checked **after** your action, at the end of your turn.  

- **What if a deck runs out of cards?**  
  Continue with fewer than 4 face-up cards in that level. No replacement occurs.  

- **Do bonuses from reserved cards count for Nobles?**  
  No. Only **purchased (face-up)** cards count toward Noble requirements.  

- **Can I use Gold to pay for a card even if I have the required gem?**  
  Yes. Gold is a wild and may be used at any time, regardless of gem availability.
