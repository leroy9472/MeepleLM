### 3. Setup
1. **Board Setup**:
   - Place game board using configuration based on player count (2–5 players).
   - Place Storm tiles as specified; gray areas and storm-covered zones are inactive.
   - Place Scoreboard and Turn Order Track.
   - Select Power tile colors:
     - 2 players: 2 colors (remove Act of God tiles and one duplicate of each duplicated tile)
     - 3 players: 3 colors
     - 4 players: 3 colors
     - 5 players: 4 colors
   - Place Power tiles face-up by color and level; place Creatures on matching tiles.
   - Place Special Battle cards if used.
   - Place one Temple FP token on each active Temple.
   - Place FP, Silver/Gold Action tokens, and Veteran tokens in supply.
   - Each player receives one "Diversion" DI card; unused copies are removed.
   - Shuffle DI deck and place facedown.

2. **Player Setup**:
   - Each player chooses a color and city; places Statue token in front.
   - Takes matching components: Player board, Prayer marker (placed on 7), Order marker, 5 Action tokens, 12 Units, 8 Battle cards, 4 Acquire tokens (by tile colors), and parts for 3 pyramids (2 in 2-player).
   - Draws 2 DI cards from shuffled deck.

3. **Starting Position**:
   - Randomly place Order markers on Turn Order Track.
   - Each player places 5 Units in two of their three city Districts; 2 Units remain in supply.
   - In turn order, each player places 3 pyramid levels across their Districts (options: one level each in three Districts, or one level-1 and one level-2 in two Districts).
   - Players place Acquire tokens on Player board matching pyramid colors.
   - In reverse turn order, each player selects a level-1 Power tile matching one of their pyramid colors.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of a Day Phase followed by a Night Phase.

**Day Phase**:
- Players take turns in order, each becoming the Active Player.
- On their turn, the Active Player:
  1. Checks for victory (if they have ≥9 FP and no one has more, they win).
  2. Places one Action token (normal, Silver, or Gold) and resolves the action.
  3. May play DI cards with a Day icon before or after the action.
- Players may use Silver or Gold Action tokens for extra actions.
- After all players use all normal Action tokens, the Day Phase ends.

**Night Phase**:
- Resolves in 9 steps in order, with turn order applying where noted:
  1. Offering
  2. Delta Temple Control
  3. Temple Control
  4. Adoration
  5. Prayers
  6. Divine Intervention
  7. Conscription
  8. Awakening
  9. Destiny
- After Destiny, a new round begins with the Day Phase.

### 5. Core Mechanics

**Actions**:
Each turn, the Active Player places one Action token and resolves the corresponding action.

- **Pray**: Gain 2 Prayer Points (PP).
- **Build**: Add one or more levels to a single pyramid. Cost = sum of levels added. Adding level 4 grants a Pyramid FP.
- **Recruit**: Spend PP to add Units to your Districts (max 5 per District). Adding Units to an opponent-controlled District triggers a battle (you are Attacker).
- **Acquire**: Buy a Power tile by:
  - Controlling a pyramid of matching color and level (or higher).
  - Not having already acquired a tile of that color this Day Phase.
  - Not owning a tile with identical artwork.
  - Paying PP equal to the tile's level.
- **Move**: Move one Troop. Movement consists of:
  - **Ground Move**: To adjacent zone (1 step).
  - **Harbor Move**: Between zones with harbors (1 step). Blue (trading) harbors are unrestricted; red (military) harbors can only be entered if adjacent to your city.
  - **Teleportation**: From a District with a pyramid to any zone with an Obelisk (costs 2 PP, once per Move action).
  - Total movement steps = 1 + bonuses (from tiles, creatures, DI cards), calculated at start.
  - May pick up/drop Units and Creatures during movement.
  - Entering an opponent’s zone triggers an immediate battle.

**Battle Phase**:
Triggered when a player enters a zone with an opponent’s Troop.

1. **War Council**:
   - Attacker and Defender each choose 2 Battle cards, discard one facedown, keep one.
   - May play DI cards with Battle icon (cost must be payable).
2. **Confrontation**:
   - Reveal Battle and DI cards; pay PP costs.
3. **Resolution**:
   - Total Strength = Units + Battle card + Power tiles + Creature bonuses + DI cards + 1 if in own District.
   - Higher Strength wins; Defender wins ties.
4. **Casualties**:
   - Apply unblockable (black) damage first.
   - Then apply red damage minus defender’s defense.
5. **Rewards**:
   - Attacker wins and has Units left: gains 1 Battle FP.
   - Defender wins: gains 1 Veteran token.
   - Any player not gaining FP gains 1 Veteran token.
6. **Loser’s Aftermath**:
   - Recall: Return Units to supply, gain PP = Units − 1.
   - Retreat: Winner chooses adjacent empty zone (cannot use harbors; only into loser’s city Districts).
7. **Winner’s Aftermath**:
   - Recall or leave Units in zone.
8. **Battle Ending**:
   - Discard used Battle and DI cards.
   - Update FP if control of Temple or level-4 Pyramid changed.
   - Return excess Units/Creatures to supply.

**Creatures**:
- Acquired via Power tiles.
- Not Units; do not count toward troop limit (max 5 Units + 1 Creature per Troop).
- Must be tied to a Troop; return to supply if not.
- Can be moved between supply and Troops before placing an Action token.
- Grant bonuses in battle and movement.

**Divine Intervention (DI) Cards**:
- Playable only during specific phases:
  - **Day Icon**: Before placing or after resolving an action.
  - **Move Icon**: During a Move action.
  - **Battle Icon**: During War Council.
- Pay PP cost, resolve effect, discard to shared pile.
- "Diversion" card has no effect but can be used for bluffing.

**Equilibrium Rule**:
By the end of the Day Phase, each player must have at least one Action token (any color) on each of the three floors of the pyramid on their Player Board. Players may choose an action that cannot be resolved to satisfy this.

**Silver and Gold Action Tokens**:
- **Silver**: Grants an additional normal action; place on any empty Action space.
- **Gold**: Grants a special action from a Gold Token Power Tile; place on Divine Power space.
- Multiple Gold Token Power Tiles can be owned, but only one Gold Token; only one Gold action per round.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Condition**: A player wins immediately at the start of their turn in the Day Phase if they have at least 9 FP and no other player has more FP.
- **Fame Points (FP)**:
  - **Permanent FP** (square): Cannot be lost.
    - Battle FP: Win a battle as Attacker and have at least one Unit left.
    - Divine FP: Control at least 2 Temples in Night Phase, or sacrifice 2 Units at Sanctuary of All Gods.
    - From Power tiles (e.g., Domination).
  - **Temporary FP** (round): Can be lost.
    - Temple FP: Control a Temple (taken from board or opponent).
    - Pyramid FP: Control a level-4 Pyramid (taken from supply or opponent).
- FP tokens are placed on the Scoreboard.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Ties in FP at Victory Check**: Game continues if any player has more FP than the Active Player.
- **Battle with No Units**: Winner is still determined even if all Units are destroyed; rewards and aftermath apply.
- **Teleportation Limit**: Only once per Move action, but multiple Move actions (via Silver/Gold tokens) allow multiple teleports per turn.
- **Creature Limit**: Max one per Troop; excess returned to supply at end of action.
- **Veteran Tokens**: Spent during Night Phase for PP, DI cards, or Units; unused tokens discarded at Awakening.
- **DI Card Limits**: Hand size unlimited; DI discard pile reshuffled when deck is empty.
- **Order of Resolution**: In simultaneous effects, Attacker resolves first.
