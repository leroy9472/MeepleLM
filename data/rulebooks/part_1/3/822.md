# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The city of Carcassonne in southern France is famous for its Roman and Medieval fortifications. Players develop the land around Carcassonne, deploying followers as thieves, knights, monks, and farmers to earn points. The goal is to have the most points at the end of the game by skillfully placing tiles and deploying followers to complete roads, cities, cloisters, and farms.

## 2. Components
- 72 land tiles (including one starting tile with a dark back)
- 48 followers in six colors (8 per player)
- 1 scoring track
- 1 rule booklet and supplement

## 3. Setup
1. Place the starting tile in the middle of the table.
2. Shuffle the remaining 71 land tiles and place them face-down in several stacks.
3. Place the scoring track at the edge of the table.
4. Each player chooses a color and takes 8 followers, placing one on the '0' space of the scoring track as a scoring marker.
5. The youngest player decides who begins.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Play proceeds clockwise. On each turn, a player:
1. Draws and places a land tile
2. May deploy one follower to the placed tile
3. Scores any completed features (roads, cities, cloisters)

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Tile Placement
- The new tile must touch at least one existing tile by at least one side (corner-to-corner placement is not allowed)
- All city, road, and farm segments must continue existing segments on adjacent tiles
- If a tile cannot be legally placed, it is removed from the game and another tile is drawn

### Follower Deployment
- Only one follower may be deployed per turn
- The follower must come from the player's supply
- The follower must be deployed to the tile just placed
- The player chooses whether the follower is a knight (city), thief (road), monk (cloister), or farmer (farm)
- A follower cannot be deployed to a feature (road, city, farm) that is already occupied by any player's follower, even if far away

### Scoring Completed Features
#### Roads
- A road is complete when both ends connect to a crossing, city, or cloister, or when it forms a closed loop
- The player with a thief on the completed road scores 1 point per tile in the road
- If multiple players have thieves, the player with the most thieves scores all points; in case of a tie, all tied players score full points

#### Cities
- A city is complete when fully enclosed by walls with no gaps
- The player with a knight in the completed city scores 2 points per city segment and 2 points per pennant
- Exception: A completed city with exactly 2 segments scores only 2 points total (plus pennants)
- If multiple players have knights, the player with the most knights scores all points; in case of a tie, all tied players score full points

#### Cloisters
- A cloister is complete when surrounded by 8 land tiles (including diagonals)
- The player with a monk in the cloister scores 9 points (1 for each surrounding tile plus the cloister tile)

### Returning Followers
- After a road, city, or cloister is scored, all involved followers (thieves, knights, monks) are returned to their owners
- Farmers remain on farms for the entire game and are never returned

### Farms
- Connected farm segments form a farm
- Farms are separated by roads, cities, and the edge of the playing area
- Farmers are deployed to farms and remain there for the entire game
- Farms are scored only during final scoring

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### End of Game
- The game ends at the end of the turn when the last land tile is placed
- Any features completed by the last tile are scored normally

### Final Scoring
#### Incomplete Features
- Incomplete roads: 1 point per segment
- Incomplete cities: 1 point per segment and 1 point per pennant
- Incomplete cloisters: 1 point for the cloister plus 1 point for each surrounding tile
- For incomplete roads and cities with multiple followers, the player with the most followers scores; in case of a tie, all tied players score full points

#### Farms
- Only completed cities are scored for farms
- The player with the most farmers on a farm scores 3 points for each completed city that borders or lies within the farm
- If multiple players have the most farmers on a farm (tie), all tied players score full points
- If a city borders multiple farms, each farm's owner scores 3 points for that city
- Farms are scored from the perspective of the farm (3rd edition rules)

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a follower be deployed to a feature that connects to an occupied feature far away?** No. If any part of a feature (road, city, farm) is occupied, no other follower can be deployed to any part of that same feature, regardless of distance.
- **What happens when a tile connects previously separate features?** When placement connects features, they become a single feature. If this completes the feature, it is scored immediately.
- **Can a player score and have their follower returned in the same turn?** Yes, in this order: 1) Complete a feature with the new tile, 2) Deploy a follower, 3) Score the completed feature, 4) Return followers to their owners.
- **How are farms separated?** Farms are separated by roads, cities, and the edge of the playing area. A city that is within a farm does not separate it.
