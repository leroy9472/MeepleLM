### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Actions**: Each character may perform up to 3 actions per day. Black dots on state tokens block corresponding actions.
- **Movement**: Free within shelter via open paths. Ladders allow vertical movement. Obstacles (Bars, Locked Door, Rubble) block movement unless cleared.
- **Clearing Shelter Cards**:
  - Rubble: Shovel or 2 characters.
  - Closed Door: Lockpick + Black Die roll (1–3 fail, 4–10 success, discard Lockpick).
  - Bars: Saw Blade.
- **Crafting Fittings**: Place Fitting card from Fittings deck on empty space, assign character, pay resources, flip face-up.
- **New Ideas**: Use action to add 2 cards from Ideas deck to Fittings deck.
- **Scavenging**:
  - Up to 3 characters.
  - Choose location, set Noise to 1.
  - Draw Exploration cards equal to location number (10, 12, or 14).
  - Roll Black Die when prompted; if ≤ Noise, trigger Resident encounter.
  - Resolve cards one by one.
- **Combat**:
  - Round-based. Roll Combat Die based on weapon:
    - No Weapon: White
    - Melee: Yellow
    - Firearm: Red
  - Icons = wounds dealt.
  - Prowess = re-rolls.
  - Shooters roll first; if they kill non-shooter, target doesn’t attack.
  - Ammo required for firearms (discard 1 per shot; 2 for Assault Rifle burst).
  - Backstab when fleeing.
- **Night Raid**:
  - Draw Night Raids card (Damage = items stolen, Wounds = distributed to guards).
  - Roll Combat Die for each guard based on weapon.
  - Board-Up tokens reduce Damage or Wounds by 1 each.
- **Fate Cards**: Draw at Dawn. Can trigger Trust Fate mechanic in combat (roll $ icon → draw Fate card; if color matches, resolve text).
- **Alcohol**: Moonshine (+2 Fatigue, –1 Misery), 100% Alcohol (+1 Fatigue, –1 Misery). Usable at Dawn.
