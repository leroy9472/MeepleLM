## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
7 Wonders is a civilization-building board game where players construct cities over three Ages by drafting cards representing scientific, commercial, military, and cultural advancements. The objective is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) through a combination of constructed buildings, military victories, scientific achievements, trade, and special abilities from Wonders, Leaders, and expansions.

With expansions (Leaders, Cities, Armada, Edifice), gameplay includes recruiting leaders, engaging in naval conflicts, constructing shared Edifices, and managing economic warfare through taxes and diplomacy. Victory is determined by summing all VP sources at the end of Age III.

   - Randomly draw one Edifice card per Age; place face up with Participation pawns:
     - 3 players: 2 pawns
     - 4–5 players: 3 pawns
     - 6 players: 4 pawns
     - 7 players: 5 pawns

2. **Construct Decks**:
   - **Ages I & II**: Base game cards + n Black (Cities) cards + n Maritime (Trident) cards
   - **Age III**: Base game cards + n Black + n Maritime + (n+2) Purple Guild cards  
     *(n = number of players)*

3. **Player Setup**:
   - Each player receives:
     - 1 random Wonder board (choose side)
     - 1 Shipyard board + 4 Fleet miniatures (start on first space)
     - 6 Coins
     - 4 Leader cards (via draft: pick one, pass rest right until all have 4)

4. **Deal First Hand**:
   - Each player draws 9 cards from Age I deck.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each Age consists of 8 rounds. Each round follows this order:

#### A. Leader Phase (Start of Age Only)
At the start of each Age, before drawing cards, each player chooses one of their Leader cards and performs **one** action:
- **Reveal & Play**: Pay cost (equal to current Age: 1, 2, or 3 Coins); place face up; effect active.
- **Construct Wonder Stage**: Use card to pay cost of next Wonder stage (resources and/or coins).
- **Sell Card**: Discard card to gain 3 Coins **or** move Yellow Fleet one space for free.

> *Note: In Age III, players have only 2 Leaders; choose one to play, discard the other.*

#### B. Age Phase (Per Round)
1. **Choose Card**: All players select one card from hand, place face down.
2. **Pass Hand**: Pass remaining cards to neighbor (left in Ages I & III, right in Age II).
3. **Reveal & Play Simultaneously**: Perform **one** main action:
   - **Build Card**: Reveal card, pay cost (resources and/or coins), add to city.
   - **Build Wonder Stage**: Pay cost shown on Wonder board; place card face down under stage.
   - **Sell Card**: Discard card; gain 3 Coins **or** move Yellow Fleet one space for free.

##### Additional Actions (Optional, if applicable):
- **Participate in Edifice**: When building a Wonder stage, pay Edifice cost and take a Participation pawn.
- **Advance Fleet**: When building a card or Wonder stage, pay construction cost **and** fleet advancement cost simultaneously to move matching-color fleet.
- **Explore Island**: When moving Green Fleet to an Island space, draw 4 Island cards of matching level; divide evenly among explorers; each chooses one to keep.

#### C. Order of Operations (End of Turn)
Resolve in this order:
1. Pay construction costs (card/wonder + naval/edifice)
2. Advance fleets
3. Apply card/Wonder effects (except coin loss)
4. Apply Shipyard effects (except coin loss)
5. Construct cards from discard (e.g., Halikarnassós)
6. Resolve coin losses (taxes, penalties, debts)

> *Note: All gains occur before losses. Unpaid losses become Debt tokens (-1 VP each).*

#### D. End of Age Resolution (After Round 8)
1. **Edifice Completion Check**:
   - If all Participation pawns taken → Edifice built; all contributors gain Reward.
   - If not completed → non-participants suffer Penalty (lose card, coins, or tokens); Debt tokens used if unable to pay.

2. **Diplomacy Resolution**:
   - Players with Diplomacy tokens skip Military Conflicts; neighbors fight as adjacent.
   - Discard one Diplomacy token per use (only one used per conflict).

3. **Maritime Conflict (Armada)**:
   - Compare total Naval Strength (Red maritime cards, Shipyard, Islands, Wonder).
   - Award tokens:
     - Strongest: +3/+5/+7 (by Age)
     - Second: +1/+3/+5
     - Weakest: -1/-2/-3
   - Ties:
     - First: All tied take second-place token; no one else gets second.
     - Second: No one takes second-place token.
     - Last: All tied take defeat token.

4. **Landing Conflicts (Armada)**:
   - Triggered by some Red cards; player gives Landing token to designated target (neighbor’s neighbor).
   - Target fights that player in addition to neighbors; normal military rules apply.

5. **Military Conflict**:
   - Compare military strength with each neighbor.
   - For each:
     - Win: +1/+3/+5 Victory token
     - Lose: -1 Defeat token
     - Tie: no token
   - Boarding tokens force additional fight with player two seats away.
   - Diplomacy tokens allow skipping conflict.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Resource Production
- **Brown (Raw)**: Wood, Stone, Ore, Clay – produced once per symbol.
- **Grey (Manufactured)**: Glass, Cloth, Papyrus – produced once per symbol.
- **Yellow/Wonder**: Some provide starting or conditional resources.
- **Once per turn**, each resource symbol can be used once by owner or purchased by neighbor.

#### Trading
- Buy resources from immediate neighbors:
  - Common (Brown/Grey): 2 Coins each
  - With Trading Post (Yellow): 1 Coin
- Cannot buy from:
  - Cards built this turn
  - Yellow cards
  - Wonder stages (except starting resource)
- Neighbor retains use of sold resource.

#### Free Builds (Chaining)
- From Age II onward, some cards can be built for free if you have a matching symbol (e.g., same color or specific icon).
- Chain symbol(s) in top-right corner indicate prerequisite.

#### Naval Mechanics (Armada)
- **Naval Strength**: From Red maritime cards, Shipyard, Islands, Wonder.
- **Fleet Advancement**: Pay cost to move fleet; enables shipbuilding, island exploration, tax triggering.
- **Commercial Level**: Determined by Yellow Fleet position; reduces tax damage.
- **Taxes**: Triggered when Yellow Fleet lands on tax space; others lose (Tax Amount – Commercial Level) coins.
- **Protection Effects**: Some cards prevent loss from taxes or pirate effects.

#### Edifice Mechanics
- Shared project per Age; players contribute via Wonder stage construction.
- Participation pawns track contributions.
- Full completion → reward for all contributors.
- Failure → penalty for non-contributors.

#### Leaders
- Recruited during Leader Phase.
- Effects activate immediately or at endgame.
- Can be permanent, conditional, or one-time.

#### Debt
- Triggered when unable to pay coin loss (tax, penalty).
- Take -1 VP Debt token per unpaid coin.
- Cannot be repaid; counts against final score.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after Age III. Score in this order:

1. **Wonder Board**: Sum VP from constructed stages.
2. **Treasury**: 1 VP per full set of 3 Coins. Subtract 1 VP per Debt token.
3. **Military Conflicts**: Sum values of all Victory (+1/+3/+5) and Defeat (-1/-2/-3) tokens.
4. **Blue Cards**: Sum printed VP.
5. **Yellow Cards**: Apply endgame effects (e.g., 1 VP per Yellow card, per guild).
6. **Green Cards**: Two scoring methods:
   - **Sets of identical symbols**: (Number)² (e.g., 4 gears = 16 VP)
   - **Sets of 3 different symbols**: 7 VP per set
   - *Add both totals*
7. **Purple Cards**: Apply individual effects (e.g., per neighbor’s card, per wonder stage).
8. **Black Cards (Cities)**: Apply endgame effects (e.g., per black card in city).
9. **Leaders**: Apply endgame effects (e.g., per wonder stage, per science set).
10. **Maritime Conflicts (Armada)**: Sum VP from maritime tokens.
11. **Island Cards (Armada)**: 2 VP each.
12. **Edifice Participation**: Apply reward/penalty; sum VP.

**Total**: Add all categories. Highest score wins. Tiebreaker: Most coins. If still tied, shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use resources from a card my neighbor just built?**  
  No. Cannot buy resources from cards constructed this turn.

- **Can I use a free build and still gain its benefit (e.g., coins)?**  
  Yes. Paying no cost still triggers effect.

- **Can I advance multiple fleets in one turn?**  
  Yes, if multiple cards or effects allow it, and costs are paid.

- **Can I use a card from discard to build a ship or participate in Edifice?**  
  No. Cards built from discard (e.g., Halikarnassós) cannot trigger shipbuilding or Edifice participation.

- **Do Diplomacy tokens block Landings or Boarding attacks?**  
  No. Diplomacy only skips normal neighbor conflicts. Landing and Boarding attacks still occur.

- **Can I contribute to Edifice more than once per Age?**  
  No. Only once per Age, when building a Wonder stage.

- **Can I have multiple copies of the same Leader?**  
  No. Each Leader is unique; cannot recruit duplicates.

- **What happens if I can’t pay a Penalty (e.g., lose 2 military tokens but only have 1)?**  
  Pay what you can; take Debt tokens for remainder (if applicable).

- **Can I use coins gained this turn to pay construction costs?**  
  No. Only coins from previous turns can be spent.

- **In team play, do we share resources or coins?**  
  No. Each player uses own resources and coins. Cannot lend coins.
