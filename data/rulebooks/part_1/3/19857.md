# Glory to Rome (Black Box Edition) — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In 64 AD, Rome has been devastated by fire. Players take on the role of young Patricians striving to restore *Glory to Rome* by rebuilding structures and amassing personal wealth. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) through influence, completed buildings, materials sold, and bonuses.

### 2. Components
- 159 Order cards (44 types)
- 36 Site cards (6 types, 6 per type)
- 6 Jack cards (wild cards)
- 5 Player Camps (player mats)
- 1 Leader card
- 6 Merchant Bonus cards (3 VP each)
- 1 'Rome Demands' oversized card

### 3. Setup
- Place a Camp card in front of each player.
- Place the 'Rome Demands' card in the center.
- Shuffle the Order deck. Deal 5 cards face-down to each player.
- Place Jacks in a pile beside the playing area.
- For each of the 6 material types, place face-up Site cards equal to the number of players. Remaining Sites are placed face-down nearby as "Out of Town Sites".
- Deal one Order card per player into the central Pool. The player with the alphabetically first card becomes the starting Leader. Break ties with additional cards.
- Place remaining Order cards face-down as the draw pile. The initial Pool cards remain.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Leader’s Choice**: The player with the Leader card chooses to either:
   - *Think*: Draw cards (see below), then end the turn.
   - *Lead*: Play an Order card (or Jack) from hand on their Camp, declaring its Role.

2. **Follow or Think**: Clockwise, each other player chooses:
   - *Follow*: Play a card of the same Role (or Jack/petition) on their Camp.
   - *Think*: Draw cards immediately (see below).

3. **Action Resolution**:
   - The Leader performs one action for leading, plus one per matching Client in their Clientele.
   - Clockwise, each player who followed performs one action, plus one per matching Client.
   - Players who thought still activate their matching Clients.
   - Legionary actions are resolved immediately when declared.

4. **Cleanup**:
   - All Order cards used to lead/follow go to the Pool.
   - Jacks return to the Jack pile.
   - Leader passes to the left.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Roles
- **Patron**: Take a card from the Pool and tuck it under the left edge of your Camp as a **Client**. Client count is limited by Influence.
- **Laborer**: Take a card from the Pool and tuck it under the bottom edge of your Camp as a **Material** in your Stockpile.
- **Architect**: 
  - *Lay Foundation*: Place an Order card from hand as a Foundation. Attach a matching Site card (from In-Town, or Out-of-Town with 2 actions).
  - *Add Material*: Take a matching Material from your Stockpile and add it to a Foundation.
- **Craftsman**: 
  - *Lay Foundation*: Same as Architect.
  - *Add Material*: Take a matching Material from your hand and add it to a Foundation.
- **Legionary**:
  - Reveal a non-Jack card from hand. Declare: “Rome demands [Material]!”
  - Take 1 matching card from the Pool (if available).
  - Each immediate neighbor gives you 1 matching card from their hand (if possible). If not, they say “Glory to Rome!”
  - Return the revealed card to your hand.
  - With multiple actions, reveal all demanded materials at once.
- **Merchant**: Take a Material from your Stockpile and tuck it face-down under the right edge of your Camp into your **Vault**. Vault size is limited by Influence.

#### Key Concepts
- **Jack**: Wild card for leading or following any Role (except Thinker). Returns to Jack pile after use. Cannot be used as Material or Client.
- **Petition**: Lead or follow by playing 2 (Republic) or 3 (Imperium) cards of the same Role as a Jack.
- **Client**: Hired via Patron. Grants one action per turn when that Role is led, even if you think.
- **Influence**: Starts at 2. Increases by Site value when completing a Structure. Limits Clientele size and Vault capacity.
- **Stockpile**: Materials gathered via Laborer or Legionary.
- **Vault**: Hidden storage for scoring. Identity of cards is secret after placement.
- **Foundation**: Started with Architect/Craftsman. Requires Site and matching Materials to complete.
- **Out of Town Sites**: Require two consecutive Architect/Craftsman actions in one turn to claim.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### End Conditions (game ends immediately):
- Draw deck is exhausted.
- A player claims the last In-Town Site (the Structure cannot be completed).
- A Catacomb is completed.
- A player completes the Forum Romanum *and* has one of each Client type and one of each Material type in Stockpile (Republic) or completes the Forum *and* has one of each Client type (Imperium).
- All other players agree to surrender.

#### Scoring:
- **Immediate Victory**: Forum Romanum/Forum or surrender ends the game — that player wins.
- Otherwise, score:
  - 1 VP per Influence.
  - Value (gold coins) of all cards in Vault.
  - 3 VP per Merchant Bonus card (awarded to player with most of each Material type in Vault; no bonus for ties).
  - Any VPs from completed Structures (e.g., Statue, Wall).
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with the most cards in hand wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hand Size**: Default refill size is 5. Increased by Shrine (+2) or Temple (+4).
- **Client Actions**: Can be used even if you think, but not on the turn hired.
- **Legionary Neighbors**: In 2-player, only the opponent. In 3+ players, left and right neighbors.
- **Building Completion**: Requires Foundation, Site, and 1–3 Materials (per Site value). Completed Structure’s Site is tucked under Camp for Influence and ability.
- **Jacks in Hand**: Available to draw when thinking.
- **Out of Town Sites**: Can only be claimed with two actions (via Client or multiple roles).
- **Variants**:
  - *Republic*: Start with 5 cards; petition with 2 cards.
  - *Imperium*: Start with 4 cards + 1 Jack; petition with 3 cards.
