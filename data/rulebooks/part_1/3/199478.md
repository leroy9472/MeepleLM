## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the world of cycling, the Flamme Rouge (red flag) signals the final kilometer of a race. Flamme Rouge is a tactical board game where players control a team of two riders—a Sprinteur and a Rouleur—racing to be the first to cross the finish line. The goal is to be the first rider to cross the finish line. If multiple riders cross in the same round, the one who moves furthest wins. In case of a tie in position, the rider in the right-hand lane wins.

2. Components

- 190 Cards:

  - 60 Exhaustion Cards (30 Sprinteur, 30 Rouleur)  
- 6 Stage Cards  
- 4 Reference Cards  
- 21 Double-Sided Track Tiles:  
  - 1 Start  
  - 1 Finish  
  - 7 Straight  
  - 6 Soft Turns  
  - 6 Sharp Turns  
- Rider Models (Sprinteur and Rouleur per player)

3. Setup  
- Build the Track: Choose a Stage Card and lay out the track tiles in the order specified, using the lowercase sides (a, b, c...) for the first game.  
- Pick a Color: Each player takes a Sprinteur, a Rouleur, matching energy cards, and a player board.  
- Form Rider Decks: Shuffle each rider’s energy cards and place them face down on the matching spaces of the player board.  
- Form Exhaustion Decks: Place all Sprinteur and Rouleur exhaustion cards face up within reach.  
- Starting Positions: The player who most recently rode a bike (youngest if tied) places their two riders first, placing one rider at a time in any free lane behind the Start line. Continue clockwise until all riders are placed.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:  

**Phase 1: Energy Phase (simultaneous)**  
1. Choose one rider (Sprinteur or Rouleur).  
2. Draw 4 cards from that rider’s energy deck.  
3. Play 1 card face down next to the rider’s deck; recycle the other 3 by placing them face up at the bottom of the same deck.  
4. Repeat steps 1–3 for the second rider.  

*Note:* You must complete both riders’ card plays before moving to the next phase.

**Phase 2: Movement Phase**  
1. Reveal all face-down cards.  
2. Move riders in order from frontmost to last. The frontmost rider is the one closest to the finish line in the right-hand lane. Ties are broken by right-lane precedence.  
3. Riders move exactly the number of squares shown on their card.  
4. Lanes may be changed at no cost.  
5. A rider landing in an empty square must be placed in the right-hand lane.  
6. A rider cannot end movement on an occupied square. If blocked, they stop at the first square with a free lane behind the occupied square.  
7. Riders may pass through other riders during movement.

**Phase 3: End Phase**  
1. **Remove Played Cards**: Discard all cards played this round. They are used only once.  
2. **Apply Slipstreaming**:  
   - A "pack" is one or more riders with no empty square between them.  
   - Starting from the backmost pack, if there is exactly one empty square between a pack and the pack directly ahead, move the rear pack forward one square (merging if adjacent).  
   - This process repeats: newly merged packs may trigger further slipstreaming.  
   - Slipstreaming applies even after crossing the finish line (per designer clarification).  
3. **Assign Exhaustion Cards**:  
   - A rider is exhausted if there is an empty square directly in front of them (all lanes empty).  
   - Give an exhaustion card (value 2) of the matching rider type to each exhausted rider and recycle it into their deck.  
   - An empty lane (but not square) in front does not cause exhaustion.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Rider Types**:  
  - *Sprinteur*: Cards range 2–9. Excels in final sprints.  
  - *Rouleur*: Cards range 3–7. Strong on flats and rolling terrain.  
- **Mountains**:  
  - *Ascent (red tiles, chevron edges)*:  
    - Movement capped at 5 squares, regardless of card value. Excess movement is lost.  
    - No slipstreaming (giving or receiving) applies to riders on Ascents.  
  - *Descent (blue tiles, outward chevrons)*:  
    - Minimum movement is 5, even if a lower card is played.  
    - Slipstreaming functions normally.  
- **Peloton Expansion (Optional)**:  
  - *Cobblestones*: 1-lane sections; no slipstreaming to/from riders on cobblestones.  
  - *Supply Zones*: 3-lane sections; minimum speed 4 when starting movement from within (cards 2–3 count as 4).  
  - Narrowing Sections: If a 3-wide pack slipstreams into a 2-lane section, the two rightmost riders advance; the third rider moves to the rightmost lane of the rear square.  
- **Météo Expansion (Optional)**:  
  - Draw 1 token per straight tile (except first).  
  - *Crosswind*: No slipstreaming on the tile.  
  - *Tailwind*: Rider draws 5 cards instead of 4.  
  - *Headwind*: Rider draws 3 cards instead of 4.  
  - *Wet*: If rider loses ≥1 movement due to blocking, resolve a "Crash":  
    - Lay rider on their side (still occupies space).  
    - Crashed rider blocks slipstreaming.  
    - If all lanes in a square are crashed, the square is fully blocked.  
    - Next round: When moving, stand rider up and reduce movement by 2.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when at least one rider crosses the finish line.  
- The first rider to cross wins.  
- If multiple riders cross in the same round, the one who moves furthest beyond the line wins.  
- If still tied, the rider in the right-hand lane wins.  
- Optional Grand Tour:  
  - After each stage, retain half (rounded down) of exhaustion cards in each rider’s deck for the next stage.  
  - Tour Points: 3 for 1st, 2 for 2nd, 1 for 3rd (awarded to teams, based on combined rider times).  
  - Super Combative Jersey: Earn 1 token per turn leading the race. Most tokens at stage end wins 1 point (tiebreak: breakaway participation, then finish order).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Deck Runs Out**: Shuffle recycled (face-up) cards into a new deck. Draw until you have 4 cards (or all remaining if fewer).  
- **No Cards Left**: If a rider has no cards, take an exhaustion card (value 2) and play it immediately.  
- **Slipstreaming After Finish**: Yes, applies even after crossing the line.  
- **Exhaustion Condition**: Only if the entire square in front is empty. A rider with a rider in the opposite lane directly ahead is not exhausted.  
- **Lane Placement**: Always place in right lane if square is empty.  
- **Breakaway (Optional)**:  
  - Before race, players bid with two cards (summed) for one rider.  
  - Winner moves forward based on bid (higher bid first; tiebreak: rear rider first, then leftmost).  
  - Breakaway rider takes 2 exhaustion cards (1 for Baroudeur).  
  - Baroudeur: Only draws one card in auction; value is doubled.
