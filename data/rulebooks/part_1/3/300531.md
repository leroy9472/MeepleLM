# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The tribe must survive by exploring the wilderness, gathering resources, and overcoming challenges. The objective is to collect 5 Victory tokens before accumulating 5 Skull tokens. If both the 5th Victory and 5th Skull token are gained simultaneously, the players win. Specific modules may alter the win condition (e.g., resolving a special mission instead of collecting 5 Victory tokens).

## 2. Components
- 3 Boards: Base Camp, Wilderness, Night
- 222 Cards (Base Cards, People, Dreams, Ideas, Secrets, Modules)
- 40 Resource Tokens: 20 Food, 12 Wood, 8 Stone
- 48 Tool Tokens: Torch, Hand Axe, Spear, Rope, Hatchet, Trap, Raft, Tame Wolf, Pelt, Clothing, Talisman, Headdress, Tent, Roots
- 40 Wound Tokens
- 5 Skull Tokens

## 3. Setup
1. Place the Base Camp, Wilderness, and Night boards in the center.
2. Assemble the Workbench and place it near Base Camp.
3. Place the Cemetery next to the Workbench.
4. Place resource tokens near the boards: 20 Food, 12 Wood, 8 Stone. Place 5 Food on Base Camp’s storage.
5. Place 40 Wound tokens, 5 Skull tokens, and 5 Victory tokens near the Night board.
6. Place 5 Torches, 5 Stone Axes, and 5 Spears on the Workbench. Place remaining Tool tokens in front.
7. Choose 2 modules (or 3 if using Module J). Place each module’s Mission card on the Night board.
8. Place required Secret cards (facedown) on the Night board per module rules.
9. Add any required Idea cards to the Workbench with matching Tool tokens.
10. Add any required starting cards to Waiting (S) or other areas.
11. Remove specified cards (e.g., Warriors, Dream cards) and place in designated decks.
12. Shuffle Base Cards (1) with all other module cards not otherwise set aside. Deal evenly to players to form personal decks.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
### Day Phase
1. **Choose a Card**: Each player looks at the backs of the top 3 cards of their deck and selects one to reveal. Return the other two to the top of the deck in any order.
2. **Reveal & Resolve**: All players reveal their chosen cards simultaneously. In any order, players resolve one option per card:
   - Resolve an action (meet requirements and pay costs).
   - Help another player (add your group’s abilities to theirs).
   - Ignore the card (Action cards only).
3. **Repeat**: Continue until all players’ decks are empty or choose to go to sleep early by discarding their remaining deck.

### Night Phase
1. **Feed Humans**: Each human requires 1 Food. For each Food short, place 1 Skull token.
2. **Resolve Mission Cards**: For each Mission card in play, resolve one of its night actions (chosen by the group).
3. **Resolve Night Action Cards**: Each group resolves one action on any card in their group with the night symbol (●).
4. **Cleanup & Reset**: Shuffle all cards from the Wilderness board (facedown and faceup discard piles) and deal them evenly to players to form new decks.

Repeat Day and Night phases until the game ends.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Action Cards (Blue)**: Choose one of:
  - Resolve an action (meet requirements and pay costs).
  - Help another player.
  - Ignore the card.
- **Hazard Cards (Red or with !)**: Must resolve one action (positive or negative). Cannot be ignored.
- **Helping**: When helping, add your group’s abilities. You may suffer wounds or pay costs (except discarding cards) on behalf of the helped group. Rewards are shared.
- **Wounds**: Must be assigned to one human. If no heart spaces remain, the human dies (place in Cemetery, gain 1 Skull token). If last human dies, draw a new one.
- **Crafting**: Use the ● action to craft tools from the Workbench. Pay resources and meet requirements. Crafted tools go to your group.
- **Discarding Cards**: 
  - Facedown: Place on left of Wilderness. Discarding red cards causes 1 wound each.
  - Faceup: Place on right of Wilderness. Can be examined at any time.
- **Dice**: Some actions require dice rolls. Roll before committing to help. Dice results add to ability requirements.
- **Removing Cards**: Some actions require removing a card (place in Cemetery). Removed cards are out of play.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory**: Collect 5 Victory tokens (immediate win). If using Module J, instead resolve the Beast mission when 5 Victory tokens would be earned.
- **Loss**: Collect 5 Skull tokens (immediate loss).
- **Tie**: If both 5th Victory and 5th Skull are gained in the same action, players win.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Wound Distribution**: Wounds from a single card must be assigned to one human. Wounds from multiple cards can be split.
- **Helping & Costs**: The player revealing the card must discard cards for costs. Helpers cannot discard cards.
- **Crafting & Ideas**: You can only craft ideas on the Workbench. If no slot is available, remove an idea to make space.
- **Secret Cards**: Search the Secrets deck for the numbered card. Reveal and resolve it as an additional action. Only one copy per game.
- **Module-Specific Rules**:
  - **Module J (The Beast)**: Beast starts calm. When 5th Victory token is earned, resolve the Beast mission instead. After "The Beast Awakens", the Beast becomes enraged and Paw cards are distributed.
  - **Module C (Howls in the Night)**: All cards with "Wolf" in the title are Wolf cards. Track removed Wolf cards next to Cemetery.
  - **Module I (Attack of White Hands)**: Remove 4 Warrior cards and place in a separate deck. They can take wounds for any group. If they die, gain Skull tokens.
  - **Module H (The Wide River)**: Shuffle river cards into a deck (S3). With a Raft, you may reveal a river card instead of from your deck.
  - **Module G (Rare Fever)**: All tribe members suffer 1 wound. Can be prevented normally.
