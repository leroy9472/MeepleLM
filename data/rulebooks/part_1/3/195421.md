# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In the desolate lands of Arzium lies the legendary Last Ruin — a city said to fulfill the deepest desires of the heart. Eight wanderers embark on a journey across ancient ruins, forgotten wonders, and dangerous frontiers to uncover its secrets. Players assume the roles of these travelers, seeking glory, redemption, or reunion as they explore diverse regions, recruit allies from four factions, and overcome threats.

The goal is to earn the most Journey Points through exploration, quests, and influence. Victory is determined at the end of each game session, with final scores tallied across multiple sessions in campaign formats.
