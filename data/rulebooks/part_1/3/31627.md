## Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries is a route-building strategy game set across Scandinavia and Finland. Players compete to connect distant cities by claiming railway routes using train cards. The goal is to earn the most points by completing destination tickets, claiming valuable routes, and potentially earning the Globetrotter bonus for completing the most tickets.

### 2. Components  
- Game board showing Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark) and key cities  
- 40 Train cars per player (in player colors)  
- Train Car cards in multiple colors plus Locomotives (wild cards)  
- Destination Ticket cards  
- Scoring track with markers  
- "Globetrotter" bonus card (awarded at endgame)

### 3. Setup  
- Each player receives:  
  - 40 Train cars  
  - 4 Train Car cards (dealt face-down)  
  - 5 Destination Ticket cards (dealt face-down)  
- Players must keep at least 2 of the 5 Destination Tickets; discarded tickets are **removed from the game**.  
- Reveal 5 Train Car cards face-up in a display row.  
- Place scoring markers at "0" on the score track.  
- The most experienced player goes first.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, they must take **one** of the following three actions:  

#### A. Draw 2 Train Car Cards  
- Draw two cards, from any combination of:  
  - The face-up display (take one, then immediately replace it from the deck)  
  - The top of the deck (blind draw)  
- A player may take **two face-up Locomotive cards** in one turn.  
- When taking a face-up card, **replace it immediately** before drawing the second card.  
- If the deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.  
- **Important**: Unlike other editions, **three face-up Locomotives do not trigger a reshuffle**—this rule does not apply.

#### B. Claim a Route  
To claim a route, a player must:  
- Play a set of Train Car cards matching the route’s length and color.  
- Routes may be colored (specific color required) or gray (any single color).  
- Place one of your train cars on each space of the route.  
- Score points immediately based on route length:  

| Route Length | Points |
|--------------|--------|
| 1            | 1      |
| 2            | 2      |
| 3            | 4      |
| 4            | 7      |
| 5            | 10     |
| 6            | 15     |
| 9            | 27     |

##### Special Route Types:  
- **Ferry Routes** (show 1 or more Locomotive symbols):  
  - For each Locomotive symbol: play 1 Locomotive card **or any 3 Train Car cards**.  
  - For each colored space: play 1 matching color card, 1 Locomotive, or any 3 cards.  
  - Locomotives **may** be used here.  

- **Tunnel Routes** (marked with a heavy black border):  
  - Play cards as normal.  
  - Reveal the top 3 cards from the Train Car deck.  
  - For each revealed card matching the route color **or** a Locomotive:  
    - You must play **one additional** matching color card or Locomotive.  
  - If you cannot or choose not to pay the additional cost, take your cards back, discard the revealed cards, and your turn ends.  
  - If claiming with only Locomotives, only revealed Locomotives increase the cost.  

- **Murmansk–Lieksa Route** (9-space gray route):  
  - Any 4 Train Car cards (including Locomotives) may be used as a substitute for **one** card of the required color.  
  - This substitution can be used multiple times during the claim.  
  - Example: To claim a 9-length gray route, you could play 5 green cards and 4 "4-card substitutes" (total 21 cards).  

- **Double Routes**:  
  - Parallel routes between the same cities.  
  - A single player may claim only one of the two routes.  
  - In a **2-player game**: only one route may be claimed total (the other is blocked).  
  - In a **3-player game**: both routes may be claimed by different players.

#### C. Draw Destination Tickets  
- Draw 3 Destination Ticket cards from the top of the deck.  
- Keep **at least 1**; return unkept cards to the **box** (they are **removed from the game**).  
- If fewer than 3 remain in the deck, draw all available.  
- Players may hold any number of tickets.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Locomotives**:  
  - **Cannot be used on regular routes.**  
  - May **only** be used when claiming:  
    - Ferry routes  
    - Tunnel routes  
    - Murmansk–Lieksa route (as part of 4-card substitution)  
- **Card Drawing**:  
  - Face-up cards are replaced immediately after being taken.  
  - No penalty for 3 face-up Locomotives.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - Score route points immediately upon claiming.  
  - Destination Tickets: add points if completed, subtract if not.  
- **Endgame Trigger**:  
  - When a player ends their turn with **2 or fewer trains left**, all other players (including the triggerer) take **one final turn**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
At the end of the final round:  
1. **Reveal all Destination Tickets**.  
2. For each ticket:  
   - If the two cities are connected by a continuous path of your trains, **add** the points.  
   - If not, **subtract** the points.  
3. **Globetrotter Bonus**:  
   - Award 10 points to the player who completed the **most** Destination Tickets.  
   - In case of a tie, **all tied players** receive 10 points.  
4. **Total Scores**: Sum route points, ticket points, and bonuses.  
5. **Winner**: Highest total score.  

### 7. Tiebreakers  
In case of a tie in total score:  
1. Player who completed the **most Destination Tickets** wins.  
2. If still tied, player with the **longest continuous route** wins.
