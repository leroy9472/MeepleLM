## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective
In the near future, rising waters have led to the creation of underwater stations, dividing humanity into Alphans and Omegans. Conflicts erupt over territorial waters. Players command fast, armed submarines to protect their territory.

Goal: Win by either:
- Sudden Death mode: Inflict 1 damage to the enemy sub.
- Hunt mode: Inflict 4 damages to the enemy sub.

2. Components
- 2 sets of 10 player sheets (Red and Blue teams)
  - Double-sided: dark for Real Time, light for Turn by Turn
  - Includes Captain, First Mate, Engineer, and Radio Operator sheets per team
- 2 transparent sheets (for Radio Operators)
- 8 erasable marker pens
- 2 screens

3. Setup
1. Place both screens end-to-end in the center of the table.
2. Choose a scenario (e.g., Alpha-2, Bravo-2, Charlie-2, Delta-2, Echo-2). Each Captain and Radio Operator takes the corresponding sheet.
3. Select game mode:
   - Real Time: Use dark side of sheets.
   - Turn by Turn: Use light side of sheets.
4. Teams sit on opposite sides of the screens. Player order per team: Radio Operator, Captain, First Mate, Engineer.
5. Assign roles:
   - 4 players/team: One per role.
   - 3 players/team: One player as Captain + First Mate.
   - 2 players/team: One player as Captain + First Mate + Engineer.
6. First Mate and Engineer take their sheets. Radio Operator takes a transparent sheet.
7. Each player takes an erasable marker pen.

4. Gameplay Flow
- Real Time Mode: Captains announce moves simultaneously at their own pace. After each move, First Mate and Engineer perform upkeep and say "OK" before next move.
- Turn by Turn Mode: Captains alternate turns. After a move, may activate one system. Opponent must complete turn before next action.

Core Sequence per Move:
1. Captain announces direction (e.g., "Head North") and marks move.
2. First Mate marks one gauge of choice and says "OK".
3. Engineer marks one breakdown in the direction's control panel and says "OK".
4. Captain may then move again or activate a system.

5. Core Mechanics
Systems Activation:
- A system must be fully charged (by First Mate) and free of breakdowns (by Engineer).
- To activate, player raises fist and says "Stop!" (pausing all play).
- Only one system may be activated per turn; at least one move must occur between activations.

System Types:
- Captain-only (Red): Mine, Torpedo
- Captain-only (Yellow): Silence, Scenario
- First Mate or Captain (Green): Drone, Sonar

Mine:
- Dropping: Captain marks "M" adjacent to sub (not on path). Announces "Mine dropped!".
- Triggering: Captain says "Stop! Triggering mine at [coordinate]". No charge required, but red systems must be functional. Damage rules same as Torpedo.

Torpedo:
- Captain announces "Torpedo launched, impact at [coordinate]" (1–4 spaces away, straight or stepped, not diagonal).
- Effects:
  - >1 space away: "Clear".
  - Adjacent (including diagonal): "Indirect impact, one damage".
  - Same space: "Direct hit, two damage".
- Firing at own adjacent mine causes self-damage.

Drone:
- First Mate or Captain says "Stop! Launching drone". Asks enemy Captain: "Are you in sector X?".
- Opposing Captain answers truthfully "Yes" or "No".

Sonar:
- First Mate or Captain says "Stop! Activating sonar".
- Opposing Captain gives two of: row, column, sector. One true, one false.

Silence:
- Captain says "Stop! Activating silence".
- Moves 0–4 spaces straight, silently indicating direction to crew.
- Counts as one move for First Mate and Engineer (unless moving 0).

Surfacing:
- Captain announces "Surfacing in sector X!" and states sector.
- Real Time:
  - Crew members trace and initial one sub section each on Engineer’s sheet.
  - Enemy Engineer verifies no lines cross white border.
  - If valid, Engineer erases all breakdowns and says "Ready to dive".
  - Enemy plays normally during this time.
- Turn by Turn:
  - Engineer erases all breakdowns.
  - Enemy takes 3 consecutive turns.
- Captain erases route (keeps current position and mines).

Breakdowns & Damage (Engineer):
- Each move: Engineer marks one breakdown symbol in the direction’s control panel.
- System Breakdown: If any symbol in a system’s color is marked, system is disabled.
  - Red: Mine + Torpedo
  - Green: Drone + Sonar
  - Yellow: Silence + Scenario
- Self-Repair: If all four symbols on a circuit (grey, blue, yellow line) are marked, they erase automatically.
- Damage Conditions (First Mate marks damage):
  - All 6 radiation symbols marked → 1 damage.
  - All symbols in one control panel (N/S/E/W) marked → 1 damage.
  - If both occur simultaneously, only 1 damage is taken.
  - Repair takes precedence over damage.

6. Scoring & End Game
- Sudden Death: First team to take any damage (direct or indirect) loses.
- Hunt: First team to take 4 damage loses.
- Damage Types:
  - Direct Hit (on same space): 2 damage.
  - Indirect Hit (adjacent space): 1 damage.
  - System failure (radiation or full panel): 1 damage.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- Can you activate a system right after surfacing? No, must move first.
- Can you launch through islands? No.
- Can you drop mines diagonally? Yes.
- Does surfacing repair damage? No, only repairs breakdowns.
- Can silence allow two moves in one turn? Yes, move then activate silence to move again.
- What if a torpedo hits a mine? Mine is destroyed (no chain reaction unless adjacent).
- Can you trigger a mine immediately after dropping it? No, must move at least once in between.
- Can you use a broken system? No; attempting to do so causes a radiation breakdown.
