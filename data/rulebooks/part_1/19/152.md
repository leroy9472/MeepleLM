## Mü – Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Mü is a tactical trick-taking game for 3–6 players featuring an auction phase to determine leadership, multiple trump suits, and team dynamics. The objective is to score the most points over several rounds. The Chief (elected via auction) and their partner aim to meet a point target based on the Chief’s bid. Success grants bonus points; failure penalizes the Chief.

2. Components  
- 60 cards in 5 colors (suits): each suit contains cards numbered 0–9, with two copies each of 1 and 7.  
- Each card displays 0, 1, or 2 triangles indicating its point value:  
  - 1 and 9: 0 points  
  - 6 and 7: 2 points  
  - All others: 1 point  
- (Optional) 24 wooden markers for other games in the set.

3. Setup  
- Shuffle the full 60-card deck and deal all cards evenly among players.  
- For 3 players: remove two entire suits before dealing.  
- For 4–6 players: use all five suits.  
- The player to the left of the dealer starts the auction.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of two phases:  
1. Auction – Determine Chief, Vice, trumps, and team.  
2. Trick-Taking – Play tricks; Chief leads first.  
After scoring, the next player becomes dealer and a new round begins.

5. Core Mechanics  

Auction  
- Players take turns clockwise, starting with the dealer.  
- On their turn, a player may:  
  - Pass, or  
  - Reveal one or more cards from their hand face-up on the table (a "bid").  
- A player may rejoin the auction after passing.  
- The auction ends when all players pass in succession.  
- The number of cards bid determines the bid value (not face value).  

Chief and Vice  
- The player who revealed the most cards becomes Chief.  
- The player with the second-most becomes Vice.  
- Tie for Chief:  
  - If two or more are tied for highest bid, the player who caused the tie (i.e., the last to match or exceed) suffers a penalty:  
    - -50 points per card bid  
    - Other tied players receive +25 points per card bid  
  - The round ends; cards are reshuffled and redealt.  
- Tie for Vice:  
  - Compare highest-value card among tied players.  
  - If still tied, compare next highest, and so on.  
  - If fully tied, there is no Vice.  
- If no player bid (all passed immediately), it is an Eklat (stalemate):  
  - All players who bid 0 receive 0.  
  - The round ends; cards are redealt.  

Choosing Trumps  
- Vice chooses first: selects either a number or color (suit) from the cards they revealed. This becomes the Minor Trump.  
- Chief chooses next: selects a different number/suit or declares No-Trump. This becomes the Major Trump.  
- Chief may also choose No-Trump, in which case only the Vice’s trump is active.  
- Chief’s trump outranks Vice’s trump.  
- If one trump is a number and the other a color, cards matching both (e.g., blue 7 if blues and 7s are trumps) are the highest cards in the game.  
- If there is no Vice, only the Chief’s trump (or No-Trump) is in effect.  

Team Formation (4–6 players only)  
- Chief selects a partner from the remaining players (excluding the Vice).  
- The Chief and partner form a team.  
- The Vice and all others form the opposing team.  
- In 3-player games: no partner is chosen; Chief plays alone.

Card Play  
- Chief leads the first trick, playing any card from hand or from their revealed auction cards.  
- Play proceeds clockwise.  
- Following suit:  
  - A player must follow the suit (color) of the led card if able.  
  - If a trump is led (Major or Minor), all players must follow with any trump card if able.  
  - Number trumps form a separate "super-suit"; a number trump card is not part of its original color suit for following purposes.  
- Winning a trick:  
  - The highest card of the led suit wins, unless a trump is played.  
  - The highest trump wins if trumps are played.  
  - Major Trump beats Minor Trump.  
  - If two cards of equal rank are played, the first played wins.  
- The winner of each trick leads the next.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Scoring occurs in two stages:  

1. Card Points  
- Each player counts the triangles on the cards they won in tricks:  
  - 1 and 9: 0 points  
  - 6 and 7: 2 points  
  - All others: 1 point  

2. Chief Bonus  
- Add the card points of the Chief and their partner.  
- Compare total to the target from the Chief’s bid and player count:  

| Players | Bid 1 | Bid 2 | Bid 3 | Bid 4 | Bid 5 | Bid 6+ |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 3      | 21    | 24    | 27    | 30    | 33    | 36+    |
| 4      | 30    | 32    | 34    | 36    | 38    | 40+    |
| 5      | 30    | 31    | 32    | 33    | 34    | 35+    |
| 6      | 30    | 31    | 32    | 33    | 34    | 35+    |

- If the team meets or exceeds the target:  
  - Both Chief and partner receive a bonus based on Chief’s bid and trump choice:

| Chief’s Trump | Bid 1 | Bid 2 | Bid 3 | Bid 4 | Bid 5 | Bid 6+ |
|--------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| Color        | 20    | 30    | 40    | 50    | 60    | +10 each |
| Number       | 30    | 40    | 50    | 60    | 70    | +10 each |
| No-Trump     | 40    | 50    | 60    | 70    | 80    | +10 each |

- If the team fails:  
  - The Chief loses 10 points for each "bid level" short of the target.  
    - Example: Target for bid 4 is 36; team scores 31 → equivalent to bid 2 → shortfall = 2 → Chief loses 20 points.  
  - Each opposing player gains 5 points per shortfall level.  
  - The partner gains/loses nothing.  

Recording Scores  
- Record individual card points and apply bonuses/penalties.  
- The player to the left of the dealer shuffles and deals the next round.  
- Play continues until a pre-agreed total (e.g., 200 points). The player with the most points wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can a player play fewer cards than the current high bid?  
  A: Yes. Players may stay in the auction without leading by playing any number of cards.  
- Q: Can a player use auction cards during trick play?  
  A: Yes. Auction-revealed cards remain part of the player’s hand and can be played in tricks.  
- Q: What happens if there is no Vice in a 4+ player game?  
  A: The Chief selects a partner normally. Only the Chief’s trump is active.  
- Q: Can the Chief choose a trump not in their auction cards?  
  A: No. The Chief must choose a number or color from the cards they revealed.  
- Q: Do number trumps count as their original color?  
  A: No. Number trumps form a separate suit. Players need not follow color if a number trump is played.
