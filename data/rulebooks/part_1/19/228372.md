### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Randomly place the 5 Railroad Initiative tiles along the Initiative Track on the left side of the board. All arrows point downward.  
3. Place 22 matching Locomotives beside each Initiative tile. Leave space for each company’s Treasury.  
4. Place each Railroad’s Dividend disk at the bottom (first space) of the Dividends Track.  
5. Place each Railroad’s Share Value disk next to the Share Value Track (initial position varies).  
6. Give each player:  
   - ₧40 in cash  
   - 1 Player tile  
   - 12 Share cubes in their color  
7. Place the Round Marker on the first space of the Round Track (top-left).  
8. Form a bank from the currency cards.  
9. Randomly choose a starting player. That player receives the Priority Deal token.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **10 rounds**, alternating between **Stock Rounds** and **Build Rounds** in this fixed order:

> Stock → Build → Stock → Build → Build → Stock → Build → Build → Stock → Build

After each round, advance the Round Marker. The game ends immediately after the final Build round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Stock Rounds  
- Begins with the player holding the **Priority Deal token**, proceeds clockwise.  
- On your turn, you may:  
  - **Buy one share** in any railroad with unsold shares, OR  
  - **Pass**  
- **Buying a Share:**  
  - Place your cube in the topmost available share space on a Railroad Initiative tile.  
  - Pay the current **Share Value** (from Share Value Track) to the **Railroad’s Treasury**.  
  - You may not buy more than **one share per railroad per Stock Round**.  
  - You may buy from multiple railroads in one round.  
- **Starting a Railroad (First Share):**  
  - Choose a starting **Share Value** between ₧12 and ₧36.  
  - Place the Railroad’s Share Value disk on that space.  
  - Pay that amount to the Railroad’s Treasury.  
  - Place one of the Railroad’s Locomotives in a **Major City**.  
    - Cannot place in an occupied Major City unless all are full.  
  - Move the Railroad’s Dividend disk to the **first space** on the Dividends Track.  
- **Passing:**  
  - You may pass at any time.  
  - If all players pass **consecutively**, the round ends.  
  - The **first player to pass after the last purchase** takes the Priority Deal token for the next Stock Round.  
  - You may re-enter the auction if others buy after you.

#### Build Rounds  
- Railroads build in **Initiative Order**, determined by filled share spaces on Initiative tiles:  
  - Start at the topmost filled share on the top railroad.  
  - Proceed down the list, skipping railroads with no shareholders.  
  - Within a railroad, shareholders build in order from top to bottom.  
- Each **shareholder** may build **one track** (one locomotive) per Build Round.  
- **Building Track:**  
  - Take one unused locomotive from the company.  
  - Place it in a hex adjacent to existing company track **or** accessible via **leased track**.  
  - Pay the **build cost** to the bank:  
    - Easy hex: ₧4  
    - Difficult hex: ₧8  
    - Urban hex: ₧4  
    - Major City hex: ₧4  
  - Only one locomotive per railroad allowed per hex.  
  - Easy/Difficult hexes: only one railroad may occupy.  
  - Urban/Major Cities: multiple railroads may coexist.  
- **Leasing Track:**  
  - Allowed only through **Easy** and **Difficult** hexes.  
  - Must take the **shortest route** (fewest hexes) from existing track to destination.  
  - Cost per leased hex:  
    - Easy: ₧2 → paid to leasing railroad’s Treasury  
    - Difficult: ₧4 → paid to leasing railroad’s Treasury  
  - Pay **build cost** of destination hex to the bank.  
  - Example: Leasing 2 Difficult and 1 Easy hex → pay ₧8 + ₧2 = ₧10 to railroads, plus build cost to bank.

#### Effects of Building  
- **Urban Hex:**  
  - Move Railroad’s Dividend disk **up 1** space.  
- **Major City Hex:**  
  - Move Dividend disk **up 2** spaces.  
  - Move Share Value disk **up 1** space.  
- **Dividend Payout:**  
  - After **all** shareholders of a railroad have built, the railroad pays dividends.  
  - Each **owned share** earns cash from the bank equal to the current Dividend Track value.  
  - Each **unsold share** earns cash for the **Railroad’s Treasury** (same amount).  
- **Major Cities Connection Bonus:**  
  - When a railroad connects to **5 Major Cities** (via owned or leased track), it triggers a **Special Dividend**.  
  - Bonus amount is shown on the board by color (e.g., ₧5 per share).  
  - Shareholders receive bonus × number of shares owned.  
  - Railroad Treasury receives bonus × number of unsold shares.  
  - This bonus can trigger multiple times and for multiple railroads.  

#### Share Value Penalty  
- If a railroad **fails to connect to a new Urban or Major City hex** during its entire Build turn (i.e., no shareholder builds into such a hex), its Share Value drops:  
  - **One space per player-owned share** (unsold shares do not count).  
  - Example: 4 shares owned → drop 4 spaces.  
- Share Value cannot drop below the leftmost space or exceed the rightmost.

#### Share Value Restrictions  
- Share Value is bounded by the ends of the Share Value Track.  
- Cannot increase beyond the rightmost space or decrease below the leftmost.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends after the **final Build Round**.  
- Final scoring:  
  - For each share you own, add the **current Share Value** of that railroad to your cash.  
  - Example: You own 2 shares in a railroad with Share Value ₧30 → add ₧60.  
- Total your:  
  - Cash on hand  
  - Value of all owned shares  
- Highest total wins. Ties are allowed.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip building even if funds are available?**  
  Yes. Strategic skipping is common to conserve money, avoid penalties, or block opponents.  
- **Can a railroad build more than once per round?**  
  Yes — once **per shareholder**. A railroad with 4 shareholders can build up to 4 times (one per share).  
- **When does a railroad pay dividends?**  
  After **all** its shareholders have had a chance to build, immediately after the last build.  
- **Can leased track be used to trigger Major City Connection Bonus?**  
  Yes. Connections via leased track count toward the 5-city requirement.  
- **Does the Dividend Track loop?**  
  Officially: if it exceeds the top, reset to bottom and add values.  
  Alternative (more consistent):  
  Dividend per Share = (100 + 5 × spaces over) ÷ (number of shares), rounded up.  
- **Can I lease through Urban/City hexes?**  
  No. Leasing is only allowed through Easy and Difficult hexes.  
- **Can two railroads lease the same hex?**  
  Yes. Multiple railroads may lease the same track hex; each pays the owner.  
- **Who controls a railroad?**  
  No single owner. Decisions are decentralized: each shareholder acts independently during their turn in Initiative Order.  
- **What happens if a railroad runs out of locomotives?**  
  It cannot build until a locomotive is returned (e.g., via game end or rule allowing reuse — none exist; locomotives are limited to 22 per company).  
- **Can Share Value increase from both building and Dividend Track?**  
  Yes. Share Value increases:  
  - 1 space when building in a Major City  
  - 1 space each time the Dividend disk crosses the ↑ icon on the Dividend Track
