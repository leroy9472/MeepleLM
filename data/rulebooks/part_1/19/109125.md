## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
During the Thirty Years' War, each player assumes the role of a military leader vying for dominance through territorial control, economic development, and influence. The objective is to amass the most victory points (VPs) by the end of the game by:

- Controlling counties  
- Constructing buildings (palaces, churches, trading posts)  
- Achieving regional majorities in building types

Victory points are scored twice—after the first and second year. The player with the most VPs wins. In case of a tie, the player with more Thalers wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 2 years (8 rounds):  
- Year 1: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter  
- Year 2: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter  

Winter is a scoring and supply phase; the other seasons follow the same sequence.

**Spring, Summer, Fall (Basic Game):**  
1. **Display Action Cards:** Shuffle 10 action cards; place 5 face-up (positions 1–5), 5 face-down (6–10).  
2. **Display Bonus Tiles:** Shuffle and place 5 bonus tiles face-up on board.  
3. **Plan Actions & Bid:**  
   - Secretly assign county or money cards to 10 action boxes on player mat.  
   - Place one unused card (money or county) in auction box as bid for turn order.  
4. **Determine Event:** Shuffle face-up event cards (4 at start of year, fewer later); draw one randomly and apply its top-half effect.  
5. **Fix Player Order:**  
   - Reveal bids. Pay amount shown (county cards cost 0).  
   - Highest bidder chooses position 1–5 and takes corresponding bonus tile.  
   - County card bids beat 0-money bids. Ties resolved by random draw.  
6. **Perform Actions:**  
   - Execute actions in order 1 to 10.  
   - All players perform action in player order before proceeding.  
   - Reveal county card only when performing action.  
   - After action, discard card and reveal next action card.  

*With Emperor’s Court Expansion:*  
Insert two steps after "Fix Player Order":  
- **Display Favor Cards:** Reveal top 3 favor cards in audience hall (sorted by number).  
- **Perform Actions at Emperor’s Court:**  
  1. **Reveal and Deploy Courtiers:** In player order, reveal cards on extra player board:  
     - **County card:** Remove 1/2/3 armies from named county; deploy same number of courtiers to entrance hall.  
     - **Dice tower card:** Remove 1/2/3 armies from tray; deploy same number of courtiers.  
     - **Money card:** No action.  
  2. **Take Court Favors:**  
     - Order: descending by courtiers in entrance hall (tie: player order).  
     - Active player moves all courtiers to audience hall, may take one favor card by discarding required number of courtiers.  
     - Apply favor immediately.  
     - Remaining courtiers return to entrance hall; unused favor cards removed.  

Then proceed to "Perform Actions".

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Actions (10 total, one per box):**  
- **Build Palace:** Pay 3 Thalers; place palace (1 per county).  
- **Build Church:** Pay 2 Thalers; place church (1 per county).  
- **Build Trading Post:** Pay 1 Thaler; place trading post (1 per county).  
- **Collect Grain:** Gain grain as shown on county card; advance grain marker.  
- **Collect Taxes:** Gain Thalers as shown; take from common supply.  
- **Deploy 5 Armies:** Pay 3 Thalers; place 5 armies.  
- **Deploy 3 Armies:** Pay 2 Thalers; place 3 armies.  
- **Deploy 1 Army/Move:** Pay 1 Thaler; place 1 army, then move any number from that county to adjacent friendly county (1 must remain).  
- **Combat/Movement A & B:** Move armies from county to adjacent. If target is neutral or enemy, combat occurs.

**Event and Bonus Tile Interaction:**  
- Apply event effect first, then bonus tile.  
- Events modify actions (e.g., limit tax collection, alter deployment).  
- Bonus tiles provide persistent benefits (e.g., +1 Thaler on tax collection).

**Combat (Dice Tower):**  
- **Triggered when:**  
  - Attacking enemy or neutral county  
  - Revolt occurs (due to collection in revolted county or winter undersupply)  
- **Armies in Combat:**  
  - Attacker: all armies moved  
  - Defender: all armies in county  
  - Neutral: 1 peasant army instead of defender  
  - Revolt: peasants = number of revolt markers  
  - Always include armies in tray  
- **Peasant Support:**  
  - No revolt markers: peasants support defender  
  - With revolt markers: peasants support attacker  
- **Resolution:**  
  - Cast all armies into tower. Winner = side with more cubes in tray.  
  - Loser removes all armies from tray to supply.  
  - Winner removes same number as loser; remaining armies placed in county.  
  - **Tie:** All armies removed; county emptied (buildings, markers removed; card to neutral pile).

**Revolt Rules:**  
- **Triggered by:**  
  - Collecting grain/taxes in a county with ≥1 revolt marker  
  - Winter: failing to supply 1 grain per county  
- **Winter Revolt Severity:**  
  - Use supply chart: unsupplied counties → number of revolts → additional peasant armies  
  - Revolts resolved in fall player order; random county selection by player to the left  
- **After Revolt:**  
  - If player wins: armies return; add 1 revolt marker  
  - If peasants win or tie: county lost (as per tie in combat)

**Winter Phase:**  
1. Apply grain loss from last event card (move grain markers back).  
2. Each player must supply 1 grain per county.  
3. For each unsupplied county, consult supply chart:  
   - Determine number of revolts and additional peasant armies.  
   - Resolve revolts as combat.  
4. **Scoring:**  
   - 1 VP per county  
   - 1 VP per building  
   - 3 VP for most palaces in a region (2 if tie)  
   - 2 VP for most churches in a region (1 if tie)  
   - 1 VP for most trading posts in a region (0 if tie)  
5. **End of Year Reset:**  
   - Reveal 4 new event cards  
   - Reset grain markers to 0  
   - Remove all revolt markers  

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Scoring occurs at the end of both winters.  
- Final scoring after second winter determines winner.  
- **Total VP Sources:**  
  - Counties controlled  
  - Buildings constructed  
  - Regional majorities (palaces, churches, trading posts)  
- **Tiebreaker:** Player with more Thalers wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Insufficient Cards for Bidding:** Uncovered auction box = no bid. Such players choose turn order last.  
- **Tie in Courtier Count (Emperor’s Court):** Use fall player order to break tie.  
- **No Available Armies for Conversion (Emperor’s Court):** Action fails.  
- **Favor Card #4, #10, #11, #18:** Effects deferred (e.g., immunity, delayed use).  
- **Dice Tower Never Emptied:** Cubes in tray stay until next combat.  
- **County Card in Auction Box:** Costs 0, beats 0-money bid, reveals no action in that county.  
- **Building Limits:** Only one of each building type per county. Max 1–3 sites per county.  
- **Movement Rules:** Must leave at least 1 army behind. No limit on armies per county.
