## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the roles of settlers developing the Oregon frontier by building structures and placing farmers across the landscape. The goal is to score the most victory points through strategic placement of buildings and farmers, managing resources, and optimizing card use.

### 2. Components  
- Building tiles (7 types, sorted into stacks)  
- Landscape cards  
- Building cards  
- Coal and gold tiles (face-down, shuffled)  
- Farmers (15 per player, in player colors)  
- Score track  
- Extra Turn and Joker tokens (1 each per player)  
- 7 Building start tiles (red backs)  

### 3. Setup  
- Sort Building tiles by type; place 7 face-up stacks near the board.  
- Shuffle Landscape cards and deal 3 to each player; place the rest as a supply.  
- Shuffle Building cards and deal 1 to each player; place the rest as a supply.  
- Shuffle coal and gold tiles face down; set aside.  
- Each player:  
  - Chooses a color and takes 15 Farmers.  
  - Places 1 Farmer on the "0" space of the score track.  
  - Receives 1 Extra Turn token and 1 Joker token, both placed "active" side up.  
- Shuffle the 7 Building start tiles (red backs) face down. Each player draws one randomly and places it in their play area.  
- Starting with the start player, each player places their start tile on any legal space on the board.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn:  
1. **Play Cards & Place**  
   Choose one of two actions:  
   - **Place a Farmer**: Play 2 Landscape cards. Place a Farmer at any of the 6 intersections of the two Landscape rows/columns.  
   - **Place a Building**: Play 1 Landscape card and 1 Building card. Place the Building on a compatible terrain space on either the Landscape row or column.  
   - **Joker Option**: Instead of playing 1 Landscape card, a player may inactivate their Joker token to substitute for a Landscape card of their choice.  

2. **Score Placement**  
   Score points or gain rewards based on the type of piece placed (see Farmer Scoring and Building Scoring).  

3. **Extra Turn (Optional)**  
   If the Extra Turn token is active, the player may use it (only once per turn) to take an additional turn immediately after this one.  

4. **Draw Cards**  
   Draw cards until holding 4 total.  
   - Must end turn with at least 1 Building card and 1 Landscape card.  
   - If a Building tile type is exhausted, player may discard any cards of that type and redraw immediately.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Placement Rules  
- **Harbor**: Must be adjacent to water.  
- **Station (Train Station)**: Must be placed on railroad tracks.  
- **Coal/Gold Mine**: Must be placed on mountains.  
- **All other Buildings**: Must be placed on green grass spaces.  
- Buildings cannot be placed on top of other buildings or farmers.  
- Farmers can be placed on any terrain except water; cannot be placed on buildings or other farmers.

#### Farmer Scoring (Placing Player Only)  
When placing a Farmer, score immediately for adjacent Buildings:  
- **Post Office**: 3 points  
- **Harbor**: 4 points  
- **Church**: 1 point per Farmer (any color) adjacent to the Church  
- **Coal/Gold Mine**: Earn 1 coal or gold tile (random draw)  
- **Warehouse**: 1 point + reactivate Joker token  
- **Train Station**: 1 point + reactivate Extra Turn token  
- **Group of 3+ Farmers**: 5 points if the placed Farmer creates a *new* group of 3 or more orthogonally/diagonally adjacent Farmers of the same color.  
  - Groups of more than 3 do not re-score when expanded.  
  - Merging two already-scored or un-scored groups does not score if any of the original groups were previously scored.

#### Building Scoring (All Players)  
When a Building is placed, all players score for their Farmers adjacent to the Building:  
- **Post Office**: 3 points per adjacent Farmer  
- **Harbor**: 4 points per adjacent Farmer  
- **Church**: 1 point per Farmer (any color) adjacent  
- **Coal/Gold Mine**: Placing player draws 1 coal or gold tile  
- **Warehouse**: 1 point per adjacent Farmer + reactivate their Joker token (if they have at least one adjacent Farmer)  
- **Train Station**: 1 point per adjacent Farmer + reactivate Extra Turn token (if they have at least one adjacent Farmer)  

#### Card Management  
- Players must always have at least 1 Building card and 1 Landscape card at the end of their turn.  
- If a Building type is exhausted from supply, players may discard matching Building cards and draw replacements immediately.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End Trigger**:  
  - A player places their last Farmer, OR  
  - 2/3/4 types of Building tiles are exhausted (in a 2/3/4-player game).  
- **Final Play**: Play continues clockwise until the player to the right of the start player has taken their final turn. The start player does **not** get a final turn.  
- **End Game Scoring**:  
  - Players score points from their collected coal and gold tiles:  
    - Coal: values 1, 2, 3 (7 of each)  
    - Gold: values 3, 4, 5 (7 of each)  
  - Total score = points from all sources (placements, groups, resources).  
- **Winning**: Highest total score wins. Tiebreaker: player with the most Farmers on the board.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I score a Farmer group more than once?**  
  No. Only when a *new* group of 3+ is formed. Expanding an already-scored group does not score again.  
- **What happens if I merge two unscored groups?**  
  If neither group has been scored before, and the merge creates a group of 3+, score 5 points.  
- **What if I merge a scored and an unscored group?**  
  No score. If any part of the merged group was previously scored, no points are awarded.  
- **Can I use Joker and Extra Turn on the same turn?**  
  Yes. Use Joker to substitute a Landscape card, then use Extra Turn to take another turn.  
- **Do I score Building effects when placing a Building?**  
  Yes — placing player gains Coal/Gold tile if applicable, and all players (including placer) score points/reactivate tokens based on adjacent Farmers.  
- **Can I place a Building on a space that only satisfies one of the Landscape cards played?**  
  Yes — Building must be on a compatible terrain space on *either* the Landscape row or column of the played Landscape card.
