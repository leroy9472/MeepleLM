### 1. Lore & Objective
Android is a thematic board game set in a futuristic world where players take on the roles of detectives investigating a murder. The central goal is to deduce the correct murderer while managing personal character plots and influencing a conspiracy network. Players aim to score the most victory points (VP) by correctly identifying the guilty and innocent suspects, resolving personal plots favorably, and gaining advantages through the conspiracy puzzle.

### 2. Components
- Murder sheet and scene of the crime marker
- Suspect sheets and testimony lead markers
- Detective sheets, figures, tip sheets, and vehicle rulers
- Twilight cards (light and dark decks)
- Plot cards (start, crossroads, and ending cards)
- Hero markers and warrant markers
- Twilight markers
- Evidence tokens (normal, surprise witness, perjury)
- Favor tokens (corp, political, society, street)
- Alibi, hit, trauma, and baggage tokens
- Dropship pass tokens
- Conspiracy puzzle pieces (shift, favor, baggage types)
- Jinteki and Haas-Bioroid tokens
- NPC status markers (Lily Lockwell, Jimmy the Snitch, etc.)

### 3. Setup
1. Select a murder sheet and place the scene of the crime, Lily Lockwell, and Jimmy the Snitch markers at their designated locations for week one.
2. Place the day marker on day one of week one.
3. Count out suspects: one more than the number of players. Place their suspect sheets beside the murder sheet.
4. Each player selects a detective and takes:
   - Detective sheet, figure, tip sheet
   - Light and dark twilight decks
   - Plot cards (3 plots, except Raymond who has 2)
   - Hero markers, vehicle ruler, warrant markers, twilight marker
5. Place detective figures at starting locations; set twilight markers at center of twilight tracks.
6. Place testimony leads at locations listed on the murder sheet. Players place their physical and document leads at color-matched locations.
7. Shuffle evidence tokens into a facedown pile.
8. Place tokens near designated locations:
   - Corp favors: Melange Mining (G7)
   - Political favors: City Hall (A2)
   - Society favors: Levy University (E1)
   - Street favors: Eastside Tenements (L3)
   - Alibis: Order of Sol (F8)
   - Hits: Humanity Labor (H1)
   - Trauma: Starlight Crusade (D1)
   - Dropship passes: NAPD (I3)
   - Baggage: Castle Club (F4)
9. Stack conspiracy puzzle pieces by type: shift (left), favor (middle), baggage (right).
10. Remove hunch cards for unused suspects; shuffle innocent (blue) and guilty (red) decks. Deal one of each to each player.
11. Each player randomly selects one plot for week one (Caprice excludes "Descent into Madness" start card).
12. Shuffle light and dark twilight decks. Place dark deck on map space; light deck beside detective sheet. Draw 2 light cards and 1 dark card from player on the left.
13. Shuffle general event deck; place on board. Choose one murder-specific event card randomly; place facedown.
14. Choose first player: places hero marker at scene of the crime, takes first player token, time sheet, and time marker.

#### Hero-Specific Setup
- **Caprice Nisei**: Place warrant on Jinteki. Place sanity card with marker at +0.
- **Floyd 2X3A7C**: Place warrant on Haas-Bioroid. Gain one Director Haas favor. Place 3 directive cards in play.
- **Louis Blaine**: Take 2 Mr. Li favors and 1 Sara favor. Mood card starts with "Louis is in a Bad Mood" side up.
- **Rachel Beckmann**: Draw 2 extra twilight cards (from own light or others’ dark decks). Money card starts at $2,000.
- **Raymond Flint**: Take one dropship pass. "Wrapped Up in Himself" card in play. Shuffle 4 memory cards; deal one to each other player; return extras unseen.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game spans two weeks (12 days), each day being a round.

**Each Round (Day):**
1. Players take turns in order, using time from the time sheet (6 time per day, except Floyd who gets 7).
2. On a player's turn:
   - Take time sheet and marker.
   - Perform actions until time runs out or player ends turn.
   - Actions include movement, following leads, drawing/discarding cards, playing light cards, using location abilities, getting a jump on the case.
3. After all players finish turns, proceed to End of Day Phase:
   - Advance day marker.
   - Resolve end-of-day events (general and plot resolutions).
   - New first player is determined by who last placed a hero marker at the scene of the crime.

**Climax:** Final two days (days 5 and 6 of week 2) are the climax. Leads followed up during climax are discarded, not moved.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Actions
- **Move to a New Location (1 Time)**: Move within vehicle ruler range. Pause between locations. Entering ritzy (♦) location: draw one light card. Entering seedy (▼) location: draw one dark card from another player’s deck. Restricted locations (Jinteki, Haas-Bioroid, Order of Sol, Humanity Labour) cost 3 time without a warrant.
- **Follow Up a Lead (1 Time)**: In location with testimony, physical, or document lead. Player on your right moves lead to same type (color), different district, no existing lead. During climax, lead is returned to box.
- **Draw or Discard a Twilight Card (0 Time)**: Draw if hand <6 (7 for Raymond). Draw light from own deck or dark from any other player’s deck. Discard to bottom of respective deck.
- **Play a Light Card (1 Time)**: Pay twilight cost by shifting marker right (dark shift). Conditions must be met. Discard to bottom of light deck.
- **Get a Jump on the Case (1 Time)**: At scene of the crime, replace existing hero marker with your own. If still present at end of day, become next first player.
- **Use a Location Ability (Variable Time)**: Spend time and other costs (favors, etc.). Can only be used once per round by a player.

#### Movement
- Five location types: Religious (yellow), Civic (green), Residential (red), Business (blue), Nightlife (purple).
- Leads must move to same type.
- Earth and Moon connected via Beanstalk (pay 1 time per location) or dropship pass (spend pass + 1 time).
- Dropship pass allows instant move to any location.

#### Following Up Leads
After following a lead:
- **Place Evidence**: Draw evidence token, look secretly, place facedown on suspect in file matching lead type. May place faceup (tactical).
  - Special evidence:
    - Surprise Witness: -5 evidence (secret)
    - Perjury: Converts one alibi/surprise witness from -5 to +5
- **Uncover the Conspiracy**: Choose:
  1. **Reveal Information**:
     - Draw top puzzle piece from pile beside hero marker.
     - Move hero marker to next pile (favor or baggage).
     - Gain benefit:
       - Shift: Light/dark shift any player
       - Favor: Gain one normal favor
       - Baggage: Place good/bad baggage on any player’s plot
     - Add piece to conspiracy puzzle: must extend at least one linkage from existing piece.
     - Gain bonuses:
       - Move a Lead: Move one lead of shown type as if just followed up
       - Place a Hit: Place hit on any suspect
       - Place a Bonus Puzzle Piece: Draw and place one more piece of same type
       - Jinteki/Haas Link: Create link to respective corp
     - If completes row/column/diagonal through center, gain one conspiracy token (+4 VP each).
  2. **Dig Deeper**: Move hero marker to next pile (favor or baggage).

#### Twilight Cards
- **Light Cards**: Played during own turn. Cost 1 Time + twilight cost (dark shift). Conditions must be met.
- **Dark Cards**: Played during another player’s turn in response. Cost 0 Time + twilight cost (light shift target). Only one dark card per event.
- **Twilight Cost**: Determined by number in corner. Can discard cards (any type) to reduce cost by 1 per card.
- **Matching Plot**: If card color matches current plot, cost may be increased or decreased by 1.
- **Traits**: Bolded, italicized words (e.g., Fight) categorize cards.
- **Fight Cards**: When played, player chooses light or dark tactics:
  - Light: Light shift, follow light effect
  - Dark: Dark shift, follow dark effect

#### Plots
- Each detective has personal plots (1 per week, except Raymond: 1 for 2 weeks).
- Plots resolve positively if more good baggage than bad; negatively otherwise.
- Resolve at end of day 3 and day 6 each week.
- Start card → crossroads card → ending card based on baggage.
- Conditional baggage (e.g., Duty) only counts if listed on current plot card.

#### NPCs
- **Lily Lockwell**: Entering her location costs 1 Time. Player may reveal one evidence token on any suspect. Then move Lily to same type, different district (not Jimmy’s location).
- **Jimmy the Snitch**: Entering his location, spend 1 Time to either:
  - Look at another player’s cards, or
  - Peek at all facedown evidence on one suspect
  - Then move Jimmy to same type, different district (not Lily’s location).
- If NPC is eliminated, discard associated favors. NPC favors count as one favor but can substitute for multiple types.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after day 6 of week 2.

**Steps to Determine Murderer:**
1. Turn all facedown evidence faceup.
2. Remove lowest-value token(s) from strong evidence file.
3. Remove highest-value token(s) from weak evidence file.
4. Match perjury tokens with alibi/surprise witness on same suspect:
   - Matched: alibi/surprise witness worth +5
   - Unmatched perjury: discard
   - Unmatched alibi/surprise witness: worth -5
5. Sum remaining evidence. Highest total = murderer (even if negative).

**Scoring:**
- Correct guilty hunch: +15 VP
- Correct innocent hunch: +5 VP
- Obsession: If same suspect for both hunches and guilty with total ≥5 more than others: both correct + additional +3 VP (total +23)
- Plot endings: Varies by card (up to +14 or -10 total)
- Conspiracy tokens: +4 VP each
- Haas tokens: +3 VP each
- Jinteki tokens: +3 VP each
- Trauma tokens: -1 VP each
- Favors: +0 VP unless modified by conspiracy links

**Winning**: Highest VP wins. Tie: if only one tied player has correct guilty hunch, they win. Otherwise, shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hand Limit**: 6 cards (7 for Raymond, including memory cards). Memory cards do not count toward limit.
- **Twilight Track**: Fully light-shifted = all the way left; fully dark-shifted = all the way right. Can still choose tactics when fully shifted.
- **Multiple Effects**: Resolve in order listed on card. For simultaneous effects, player chooses order.
- **Discarding Cards**: Can discard to reduce twilight cost only when playing own light card.
- **Plot Resolution Order**: First player resolves first, then clockwise.
- **Conspiracy Links**: Continuous line from center to group. Branching and rejoining counts as multiple links.
- **Jinteki/Haas Tokens**: Earned via location ability (discard cards, spend favors/time). Worth +3 VP each +1 VP per link to respective corp.
