## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Llama commands it: Get rid of all your negative points! The objective of LAMA is to have the fewest points when the game ends. Players earn negative points from cards they cannot play. If a player successfully plays all their cards in a round, they may return one of their previously earned tokens (either 1 or 10 points), helping them reduce their total. The game ends when any player reaches 40 or more points. The player with the lowest score wins.

### 2. Components  
- **56 cards**:  
  - 8 cards each of values 1 through 6  
  - 8 Llama cards  
- **70 tokens**:  
  - 20 black 10-point tokens  
  - 50 white 1-point tokens  
  - Tokens can be freely exchanged between 1s and 10s (e.g., 10 white = 1 black, or 1 black = 10 white)

> *Note: A variant version ("Lato z Komarami") uses 55 cards with "Bzzz" instead of "Llama" and yellow 1-point tokens, but this manual refers to the standard LAMA game.*

### 3. Setup  
1. Shuffle all 56 cards.  
2. Deal 6 cards to each player.  
3. Place the remaining cards face-down as the draw pile.  
4. Flip the top card of the draw pile to start the discard pile.  
5. Place the tokens in a shared pool.  
6. The youngest player goes first in the first round.  
   - In subsequent rounds, the last player to play a card in the previous round starts.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game is played over multiple rounds. On a player’s turn, they must choose **one** of the following actions:

#### A. Playing a Card  
- You may play a card if it matches one of these conditions:  
  - Same value as the top card of the discard pile, **or**  
  - Value is **exactly one higher** than the top discard.  
- Special rules for Llamas:  
  - A **Llama** can be played on a **6** or another **Llama**.  
  - On top of a **Llama**, you may play another **Llama** or a **1**.  
- After playing, place the card on top of the discard pile.  
- Your turn ends. Play passes to the next player.

#### B. Drawing a Card  
- Draw 1 card from the draw pile.  
- You **cannot** play a card on the same turn after drawing.  
- Your turn ends immediately.  
- If the draw pile is empty, this action is no longer available.

#### C. Quitting  
- If you cannot or do not want to play or draw, you may **quit** the round.  
- Place all your remaining cards face-down in front of you.  
- You take no further actions this round.  
- Play continues with the next player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Turn Order**: Clockwise, starting with the designated first player each round.  
- **Round Continuation**:  
  - If all but one player have quit, the last active player continues alone but **cannot draw** — they may only play cards if possible.  
- **End of Round Triggers**:  
  - One player plays their last card (goes out), **or**  
  - All players have quit the round.  
- **Discard Pile**: Always visible; only the top card determines playable cards.  
- **Card Values for Scoring**: Each numerical value (1–6) is counted only **once** per player per round, regardless of how many copies are held. Llamas are always worth 10 points, but all Llamas together count as only **10 points total** per player per round.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Scoring Phase (After Round Ends)  
1. All players tally negative points from cards they still hold (in hand or placed face-down after quitting).  
2. For each **distinct card value** (1–6) present in your cards, add that value once.  
   - Example: Holding two 4s and a 4 again? Still only 4 points.  
3. For **Llamas**: All Llamas count as **10 points total** (not per card).  
4. Total score is converted into tokens (black = 10, white = 1). Players may exchange tokens freely at any time.  

#### Returning Tokens  
- If you played **all your cards** (went out), you may **return one token** of your choice (either 1 or 10 points) to the supply.  
- You must have at least one token to return one.  
- You choose which token to return (strategically, usually the 10).

#### New Round Setup  
1. Collect all cards, shuffle them.  
2. Deal 6 cards to each player.  
3. Form a new draw pile; flip top card to start discard pile.  
4. The **last player to take an action** (i.e., play a card) in the previous round starts the new round.

#### End of Game  
- After scoring, if **any player has 40 or more total points**, the game ends immediately.  
- All players reveal their total token counts.  
- The player with the **fewest points wins**.  
- In case of a tie, tied players **share the victory**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a 1 on a 6?**  
  No. Only same value or +1. So 1 can only be played on a 1 or a Llama.  
- **Can I play a 2 on a Llama?**  
  No. Only a 1 or another Llama can follow a Llama.  
- **What if I draw the only card I can play?**  
  You draw it, but your turn ends — you cannot play it until your next turn (if it comes).  
- **Can I quit even if I have a playable card?**  
  Yes, quitting is optional — you may quit even if you could play.  
- **Do I have to draw if I can’t play?**  
  No. You may quit instead.  
- **Can I return a token if I go out but have no tokens?**  
  No. You must have at least one token to return one.  
- **What happens when the draw pile runs out?**  
  No new draw pile is formed. Players may still play or quit, but cannot draw.  
- **Can the last player keep playing after others quit?**  
  Yes, but they cannot draw — only play cards if possible.
