## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the medieval abbey, Brother Adelmo has been found dead under mysterious circumstances. Players take on the roles of monastic investigators attempting to deduce the identity of the murderer among the monks. The murderer is one unique monk defined by a combination of three traits: Order (Templar, Franciscan, Benedictine), Title (Father, Brother, Novice), and Appearance (e.g., Bearded/Clean-shaven, Hooded/Unhooded, Fat/Thin).  

The objective is to gather information through movement, questioning, and room actions, then make correct Revelations (about one trait of the killer) or a correct Accusation (naming the full suspect). Points are scored for correct deductions, and the player with the most points wins.

2. Components  
- Game board depicting the abbey rooms  
- Suspect cards (each representing a unique monk with Order, Title, and Appearance traits)  
- Scriptorium cards (special ability or information cards)  
- Bibliotheca cards (one-time effect or information cards)  
- Crypta cards (allow an extra turn when played)  
- Mass cards with Bell track  
- Player pawns  
- Confessorium die (to track last visitor)  
- Revelation chart (for recording public revelations)  
- Score sheet (for tracking points)  
- Reference sheets (player notesheets for tracking information)

3. Setup  
- Each player is assigned a monk role (Father, Brother, or Novice) and receives a corresponding cell.  
- Shuffle the Suspect cards and deal a hand to each player (number not specified in source).  
- Place the remaining Suspect cards in a draw pile.  
- Place the Mass card with the Bell marker at the starting position.  
- Each player places their pawn in the Chapel (Ecclesia).  
- Players receive note sheets to track known information.  
- The solution (identity of the murderer) is determined randomly and kept secret under the board.

4. Gameplay Flow  
A game is played in rounds. Each round consists of individual turns, followed by progression of the Mass track.

**A Round:**  
1. Players take turns clockwise, starting with the player holding the Bell.  
2. After each turn, the Bell is moved to the next position on the Mass card.  
3. When the Bell reaches the end of the track, a Mass is called.

**A Turn:**  
1. **Move**: Move your pawn up to two rooms. You cannot end your move in the same room you started.  
2. **Encounter**: If your ending room contains other pawns, you must perform an Encounter.  
3. **Room Action**: If the room has a special action, perform it.

**Encounter Rules:**  
- Choose one player in the same room and ask one question.  
- The questioned player may:  
  a) Observe a Vow of Silence (refuse to answer), or  
  b) Answer truthfully and then ask you a question in return (which you must answer).  
- Questions must not require naming a suspect directly, but may reference traits or descriptions.

**Mass Phase (when Bell track ends):**  
1. All players gather in the Chapel (Ecclesia).  
2. Pass Suspect cards clockwise (one card per player).  
3. Play an Event card (if included; not detailed in source).  
4. Pass Mass cards anti-clockwise.  
5. Reset the Bell to the next Mass card (or restart cycle).

5. Core Mechanics  

**Room Actions:**  
- **Chapel (Ecclesia)**: Starting room; location for Mass and Penance. No special action during regular turns.  
- **Confessorium (Confessional)**:  
  - Enter only if empty.  
  - Draw a random Suspect card from the last visitor.  
  - Turn the Confessorium die to your color.  
- **Cell (Cellula)**:  
  - Entering another’s cell: only if empty; steal a random Suspect card from the owner.  
  - If caught in your cell: intruder goes to Chapel for Penance and returns the card (or gives a random one if it’s lost).  
- **Scriptorium**:  
  - Draw a Scriptorium card.  
  - If it has a star (Special Book), keep it secret until played.  
  - Otherwise, read and resolve immediately.  
- **Bibliotheca (Library)**:  
  - Enter only once per game.  
  - Only if no other player has fewer Suspect cards and at least one player has more.  
  - Draw a Bibliotheca card, read it aloud, and resolve immediately.  
- **Parlatorium (Parlor)**:  
  - If Suspect draw pile has cards: draw one.  
  - If pile is empty: choose a player and specify 1 or 2 traits (e.g., “Show me a bearded, hooded monk”). They must show one matching card if possible.  
- **Crypto (Crypt)**:  
  - Draw a Crypta card (can hold only one at a time).  
  - Play it later to take an extra turn after completing a normal turn.  
- **Capitulum (Chapter Hall)**:  
  - Make a Revelation or Accusation (optional).  

**Revelations:**  
- Must be in the Chapter Hall.  
- Announce one trait of the murderer (e.g., “The killer is a Franciscan”).  
- Cannot repeat a previously revealed trait, but may contradict it.  
- Recorded publicly. Scored at game end.

**Accusations:**  
- Only allowed when:  
  - In the Chapter Hall  
  - The Suspect draw pile is depleted  
- Publicly name a suspect.  
- If any player holds that suspect’s card, they reveal it; the accuser goes to Penance.  
- If the accused is the true murderer (verified under the board), the game ends immediately.

**Penance:**  
Triggered when:  
- Caught searching another’s cell  
- Making a false accusation  
- Forgetting to move the Bell  
- Forgetting to call Mass  
- Other pre-agreed violations  

Effects:  
- Move to Chapel  
- Cannot ask or answer questions  
- Skip next turn

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End:**  
- Triggered by a correct Accusation.  
- If no one makes a correct Accusation, game may end when all possible information is exhausted (implied).

**Scoring:**  
- Correct Revelation: +2 points  
- False Revelation: –1 point  
- Correct Accusation: +4 points  
- False Accusation: –2 points and Penance  

The player with the highest score wins.  
Tiebreaker: The player who revealed the true culprit (via Accusation or final Revelation) wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I make multiple Revelations in one turn?**  
  No. Only one Revelation per visit to the Chapter Hall.  

- **Can I enter a room with multiple pawns?**  
  Yes. You may choose which player to question during the Encounter.  

- **What if all players use Vow of Silence during an Encounter?**  
  The interaction ends with no information exchanged.  

- **Can I play a Crypta card immediately after my turn?**  
  Yes, but only after completing your full turn (move, encounter, room action).  

- **What happens if the Suspect card pile is empty and no one can make an Accusation?**  
  Players continue gathering information. Accusations are only possible once the pile is empty.  

- **Can I re-enter the Library?**  
  No. The Library may be entered only once per game, subject to hand size conditions.
