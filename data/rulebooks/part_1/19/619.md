## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Bottle Imp is a trick-taking card game inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson’s short story of the same name. A cursed bottle containing an imp grants its owner power—but at a terrible cost. The imp can only be sold for less than its current price, and whoever holds it at the end of a round suffers negative points. The objective is to accumulate the highest score over multiple rounds by winning tricks—while avoiding possession of the Bottle Imp when the round ends.

### 2. Components  
- 36 playing cards: numbered 1–37 (excluding 19), in three colors (blue, red, yellow)  
- 1 start price card (number 19)  
- 1 wooden Bottle Imp  
- 3 overview cards (showing full deck distribution by color and number)  
- This rules booklet  
- 1 booklet containing Robert Louis Stevenson’s "The Bottle Imp" story  
- Paper and pencil for scoring  

Note: The deck has no card numbered 19; the start price card serves that function.

### 3. Setup (3–4 Players)  
1. Choose a dealer at random.  
2. Place the start price card (19) face up in the center. Place the Bottle Imp on top—this sets the initial price.  
3. Shuffle the 36 playing cards and deal them evenly:  
   - 3 players: 12 cards each  
   - 4 players: 9 cards each  
4. Place one overview card where each player can see it.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
#### Exchange Phase (Before First Trick)  
1. **Imp’s Trick**: Each player selects one card from their hand and places it face down under the start price card (19). These cards form the Imp’s Trick and are not revealed until scoring.  
2. **Card Exchange**:  
   - Each player passes one card face down to their left neighbor.  
   - Then passes one card face down to their right neighbor.  
   - Each player picks up the two cards passed to them.  

#### Trick-Taking Phase  
1. The player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick.  
2. Play proceeds clockwise.  
3. Each trick:  
   - The lead player plays one card face up.  
   - Other players must follow suit (match color) if able. If not, they may play any card.  
   - After all players have played, determine the winner:  
     - **If all cards > current Bottle Imp price**: Highest card wins the trick.  
     - **If any card < current Bottle Imp price**: Highest card *below* the price wins the trick and takes the Bottle Imp.  
4. Winner of the trick:  
   - Takes all played cards and places them face down in their score pile.  
   - If they took the Bottle Imp, they place the winning card face up in front of them and put the Bottle Imp on top—this sets the new price.  
   - The previous price card (if any) goes to the former owner (even if same player) and is added to their score pile (face down).  
   - The 19 card remains atop the Imp’s Trick and is not scored by anyone.  
5. Winner leads the next trick.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Suit Following**: Must follow the lead color if possible.  
- **Bottle Imp Transfer**:  
  - The Bottle Imp changes hands only when a card *below* the current price is played.  
  - Among cards below price, the highest wins.  
  - Cannot be transferred at same or higher price.  
- **Price Setting**: The card that wins the Bottle Imp becomes the new price and is placed face up under the Bottle.  
- **Scoring Delay**: Cards won in tricks are not scored immediately—only at the end of the hand.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### End of Hand  
- All tricks are played until hands are empty.  
- Scoring:  
  - **Each player except Bottle Imp owner**: Add up coin symbols on all captured cards (face-down pile).  
  - **Player holding the Bottle Imp**:  
    - Does **not** score any of their captured tricks.  
    - Instead, receives **negative points** equal to the sum of coins on the cards in the Imp’s Trick.  
    - (The 19 card is *not* scored by anyone.)  
- Record scores.  

#### End of Game  
- Play continues for:  
  - A pre-agreed number of rounds (e.g., two rounds per player), OR  
  - Until at least one player reaches a target score (commonly 300 or 500 points).  
- The player with the **highest total score** wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can the same player keep the Bottle Imp multiple times in one hand?**  
  Yes. A player can win it, lose it, and win it again. Only the final owner at hand’s end suffers the penalty.  

- **What happens if no one plays below the Bottle Imp price?**  
  The highest card wins the trick, but the Bottle Imp does *not* change hands. Price remains the same.  

- **Can a player play a low card to force someone else to take the Bottle Imp?**  
  Yes. Strategic underbidding is key. But be cautious—playing too low risks taking it yourself if no one goes lower.  

- **What if the Bottle Imp price drops to 1?**  
  It cannot go lower. Any trick with cards below 1 is impossible (no such card), so the Bottle Imp cannot be sold. The player who owns it at price 1 will keep it until the hand ends.  

- **Are the Imp’s Trick cards ever revealed?**  
  Only during scoring. Players should remember which cards they contributed.  

- **Can you look at your own discarded Imp’s Trick card later?**  
  No. Once placed, no player may look at any card in the Imp’s Trick until scoring.
