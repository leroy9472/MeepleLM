## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
GIANTS is a strategic board game set on Easter Island, where players represent rival tribes competing to erect the most impressive Moai statues on Ahu (stone platforms) around the island. The objective is to score the most prestige points by transporting and erecting Moai of varying sizes on Ahu sites, optionally placing headdresses (pukao), and managing resources efficiently. The game ends when one player erects Moai on all of their reserved bases.

- Each player starts with: 1 chief, 1 sorcerer, 2 workers, 3 tribe markers, and 7 bases.  
- Place 6 neutral workers beside the board (unused chief/sorcerer not used).

- Prepare Rongo half-tablets and logs near the board.  

**General setup (all player counts):**  
- Place special hexes on the board as per layout.  
- Each player places screen and keeps components behind it.  
- All workers, chiefs, sorcerers, and markers are initially behind player screens.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows 5 phases:

#### Phase 1: Moai Draw  
- Roll a number of white dice equal to the number of players.  
- In **Turn 1 only**, treat die results: 0 = 1, 3 = 2 (to limit early access to large Moai).  
- Results indicate available Moai sizes (e.g., 2,2,3 → two size-2, one size-3 Moai).  

#### Phase 2: Auction for Moais  
Players simultaneously bid:  
- **Tribe markers** (for choice order)  
- **Workers or Chief** (to sculpt Moai; must meet size requirement)  

**Sculpting Requirements:**  
- Size 1 Moai: 1 worker or chief  
- Size 2 Moai: 2 workers or chief  
- Size 3 Moai: 3 workers or chief  

**Auction Rules:**  
- All bids revealed simultaneously.  
- Choice order: highest tribe marker bid chooses first.  
  - Tiebreakers: most Rongo half-tablets → turn order (first player wins).  
- Players may bid 0 tribe markers.  
- Winning bidder selects a Moai and commits required sculptors.  
- After first picks, remaining Moai may be claimed by other players **if** they have uncommitted sculptors.  
- Unclaimed Moai return to stock (not discarded).  
- All bid tribe markers and sculptors go **in front of screen** (unavailable for rest of turn).  
- **Chief Limitation:** A chief may sculpt **only one Moai per auction phase**, regardless of size.  

#### Phase 3: Worker Placement  
Players take turns (starting with first player, clockwise) performing **one action per turn** until all pass.

Available actions:  
A) **Place worker/sorcerer/chief + logs:**  
   - On any hex: place 1 worker or sorcerer + up to 2 logs, or chief alone.  
   - Hexes can be shared.  
B) **Place sorcerer on special hex + use ability:**  
   - Village: gain 1 worker (immediately available).  
   - Sorcerer’s Hut: gain 1 tribe marker (immediately available).  
   - Forest: take logs equal to hex number; flip tile (resource exhausted).  
   - Adjacent to Ahu: reserve an Ahu by placing base (color-side-up). Reserved indefinitely.  
   - Clay Pit: take a headdress; place in front of screen (not yet on Moai).  
   - *Note:* Sorcerer cannot use logs he just generated in same turn.  
C) **Chief on special hex + use ability:**  
   - Spend 2 Rongo half-tablets ("break a tablet") to use sorcerer ability.  
D) **Activate tribe marker:** Place one in front of screen to gain 1 Rongo half-tablet (immediate use).  
E) **Pass:** Place pass banner; no more actions this phase.  

#### Phase 4: Transportation & Marking  
Players act in turn order. Each may perform **one** of the following:

**Move or mark a Moai or Headdress:**  
- Moai size = required strength per hex (Headdress = 1).  
- Strength = sum of **workers + logs** in a hex.  
- At least **one figure** (worker/sorcerer/chief) required per hex; logs alone cannot move statues.  
- May use **opponents’ figures or neutral workers** (no permission needed).  

**Transportation Points:**  
- When another player uses your **worker/sorcerer**, you gain **1 point per figure used**.  
- If your **chief** is used, you gain points equal to **Moai size** (1–3).  
- Logs do **not** generate points.  
- Chief must be used in full (cannot split strength).  

**Erecting Moai:**  
- Requires Moai adjacent to **empty or self-reserved Ahu**.  
- Requires **one of your workers** on adjacent hex.  
- Flip base to color-side-down to complete.  

**Placing Headdress:**  
- Requires headdress adjacent to Ahu with **erected Moai**.  
- Requires **one of your workers** on adjacent hex.  
- Place headdress on Moai.  

**Marking:**  
- Unmarked Moai/headdress can be moved or claimed by anyone next turn.  
- Place **your tribe marker** on it to reserve ownership.  
- Marker is returned during cleanup unless statue is completed.  

**Movement Rules:**  
- Moai/headdress can move any distance if strength supports it.  
- Cannot pass through same hex twice in one move.  
- Multiple statues can occupy same hex.  
- Moai do not block movement.  

At end of phase:  
- Any unplaced Moai/headdress in front of screen go to quarry/clay pit.  
- Owner may immediately mark them.  

#### Phase 5: End of Turn Cleanup  
1. Return all **figures** from board and in front of screen to behind screen.  
2. Return all **tribe markers** from in front of screen to behind screen.  
3. Remove all **wooden logs** from board (used or not).  
4. Players may reclaim **markers from Moai/headdress** (losing ownership).  
5. Pass first player pawn to next player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Worker Placement:** Core engine for gaining resources and reserving Ahu.  
- **Auction Bidding:** Simultaneous blind bidding determines Moai selection order and sculpting.  
- **Transport Chain:** Use combination of workers and logs across hexes to move statues.  
- **Shared Resources:** Opponents’ workers can be used for transport, rewarding them with points.  
- **Neutral Workers (2-player only):**  
   - Can be **recruited** by spending tribe marker: place neutral worker + your marker on any hex.  
   - Can be **moved** if unmarked: move to any hex + place your marker.  
   - Cannot move if already marked to opponent.  
   - At end of turn: **tribe markers removed**, neutral workers **stay on board**, logs removed.  
   - Neutral workers can transport statues; if used by opponent, **temporary owner gains transport points**.  
   - Unmarked neutral workers can be used **freely** by anyone.  

- **Rongo Tablets:**  
   - Half-tablets gained by activating tribe markers.  
   - Two half-tablets = one full tablet.  
   - Used to:  
     - Allow chief to use sorcerer abilities.  
     - Reveal base color under Moai (pay one half-tablet).  
   - **Final scoring:** Complete Rongo tablets **do not score points** (designer correction).  

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End:**  
- Ends **immediately after Phase 4** when **any player erects Moai on all their bases**.  

**Scoring:**  
- **Moai:** (Size × Ahu Value) + (Headdress Bonus, if any)  
- **Transportation Points:** 1 per opponent’s figure used in your transport chain  
- **Headdresses:** Scored only when placed on Moai at game end  
- **Rongo Tablets:** **No points** (rule removed by designer)  

**Total Score =**  
- Sum of all Moai scores  
- + All transport points earned  
- + Headdress bonuses  
- + 0 for Rongo tablets  

**Tiebreakers:** Not officially specified. Suggested: most complete Rongo tablets (though they don’t score), or most erected Moai.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I sculpt multiple Moai in one auction?**  
  Yes, if you have enough uncommitted workers after first sculpting. Chief can only sculpt **one Moai per auction**, even if multiple actions are possible.  

- **Can I use logs without workers?**  
  No. Every hex used in transport must contain **at least one figure** (worker, sorcerer, or chief).  

- **Can I use a chief for only part of a move?**  
  No. If used, chief must contribute full strength (3). Cannot split.  

- **What happens to neutral workers at turn end?**  
  They **remain on board**. Tribe markers placed on them are **returned** to players. Logs with them are removed.  

- **Can I move a neutral worker already marked to opponent?**  
  No. You can only move **unmarked** neutral workers.  

- **Do Moai block movement?**  
  No. Multiple Moai can occupy same hex; no blocking.  

- **Can I transport multiple Moai in one turn?**  
  Yes. As long as you have actions and movement chains support it.  

- **Can I erect a Moai on unreserved Ahu?**  
  Yes. Reservation is optional. You may erect on any unoccupied Ahu.  

- **What happens to leftover Moai after auction?**  
  Return to stock (not discarded).  

- **Can I look under a Moai?**  
  Yes. Pay 1 Rongo half-tablet to reveal base color at any time.
