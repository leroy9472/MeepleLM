## Abandon All Artichokes Solo Rules – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Abandon All Artichokes*, a bumper crop of artichokes has overrun your garden. The goal is to rid your hand of these prickly pests by building a hand of five non-artichoke vegetable cards. In the solo variant, you play against a dummy opponent while racing against a timer to achieve victory as efficiently as possible.

### 2. Components  
- Base game components of *Abandon All Artichokes* (Garden Deck, artichoke cards, vegetable cards)  
- Garden Row (setup area for face-up cards)  
- Player deck (10 artichoke cards)  
- Dummy Deck (10 artichoke cards + 5 random non-artichoke cards)  
- Timer Deck (remaining artichoke cards, face down)  
- Discard piles: Player discard, Dummy discard, Timer discard

### 3. Setup  
1. Set up the Garden Row as in the base game, placing face-up cards in the center.  
2. Deal 10 artichoke cards to yourself to form your starting deck.  
3. Shuffle 5 random non-artichoke cards (without looking at them) into 10 artichoke cards. Place this deck on the opposite side of the Garden Row. This is the **Dummy Deck**.  
4. Place all remaining artichoke cards face down beside the Garden Deck. This is the **Timer Deck**. Leave space for its discard pile.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows these phases in order:  

**0. Timer Phase**  
- Flip the top card of the Timer Deck face up and place it into the Timer discard pile.  

**1–5. Base Game Phases (Standard Play)**  
- Proceed with normal *Abandon All Artichokes* gameplay: draw, play a card, resolve effects, refill hand to 5, etc.  
- If you draw a non-artichoke, keep it. If you draw an artichoke, place it in your discard pile and draw again until you get a non-artichoke (standard rule).  

**6. Opponent Discard (End of Turn)**  
- After refilling your hand (Phase 5), flip the top card of the **Dummy Deck** into the Dummy discard pile.  
- If the Dummy Deck is empty, shuffle the Dummy discard pile to form a new Dummy Deck.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Win Condition**: Draw a hand of 5 non-artichoke cards.  
- **Dummy Deck Behavior**: Simulates an opponent; no active plays, only passive discard.  
- **Timer Mechanic**: One card is discarded from the Timer Deck each turn, tracking efficiency.  
- **Special Card Rules (vs Dummy Deck)**:  
  - **Beet**: Reveal the top card of the Dummy Deck.  
  - **Eggplant**: Take the top two cards of the Dummy Deck and replace them with two cards from your hand (if available), in any order.  

> Note: These special effects interact directly with the Dummy Deck as if it were an opponent’s deck.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when you have a hand of 5 non-artichoke cards.  

Check the number of cards in the **Timer discard pile** and use the scoring table:  

| Cards in Timer Discard | Score Message |
|------------------------|-------------|
| 5 or fewer             | PERFECT GAME |
| 6                      | You STOMPED those 'chokes! |
| 7                      | Artichokes never stood a chance! |
| 8                      | Pretty good, but could be better! |
| 9                      | The 'chokes almost had you! |
| 10 or more             | You really choked, didn't you... |

Lower numbers = better performance.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: What happens if the Garden Deck runs out?**  
  A: As per base game rules, if you cannot draw due to an empty Garden Deck, you lose. However, in this solo variant, the win condition is drawing 5 non-artichokes, so depletion is a risk during play.

- **Q: Can I use Beet or Eggplant on my turn normally?**  
  A: Yes. Beet reveals the top card of the Dummy Deck. Eggplant lets you swap the top two cards of the Dummy Deck with two from your hand.

- **Q: Does the Dummy Deck ever draw cards or play actions?**  
  A: No. It only passively discards one card per turn during Phase 6.

- **Q: What if I run out of cards in my own deck?**  
  A: Shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck, as in the base game.
