## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Tiny Epic Kingdoms*, players rule tiny kingdoms vying for dominance through expansion, magic, and warfare. The objective is to earn the most victory points (VP) by expanding your population, researching magic, building towers, and controlling valuable regions. The game ends when any player triggers one of the endgame conditions. Victory is determined by summing VP from population, magic, towers, and controlled regions.

### 2. Components  
- 15 Player Meepees (7 per player, in player colors)  
- 5 Research Tokens (1 per player)  
- 5 Shield Tokens  
- 5 Tower Tokens (1 per player)  
- 15 Resource Tokens (5 each: Mana, Ore, Food)  
- 2 War Dice (12-sided)  
- 1 Active Player Token  
- 16 Exploration Tokens (optional)  
- 13 Faction Cards  
- 8 Territory Cards (double-sided)  
- 1 Action Card  
- 1 Tower Card  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the Tower Card and Action Card in the center. Place 5 Shield Tokens beside the Action Card.  
2. Each player receives:  
   - 7 Meepees (1 color)  
   - 1 Research Token  
   - 1 Tower Token  
   - 1 Faction Card (random or chosen)  
   - 1 Territory Card (random draw; choose side)  
   - 1 of each Resource Token (Mana, Ore, Food)  
3. Distribute 6 starting resources (any combination) on your Faction Card’s resource track. Suggested: 3 Food, 2 Mana, 1 Ore.  
4. Place:  
   - Tower Token below the Tower Card (tracks tower level)  
   - Research Token below Magic Level track on Faction Card  
   - 2 Meepees on one region of your Territory Card  
5. For 2-player games: Add the "Lost Kingdom" (unused Territory Card) with neutral Meepees on each region.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Clear Action Card** (if all 5 Shields are placed).  
2. **Active Player selects** an available action (Patrol, Quest, Build, Research, Expand, Trade).  
3. **All players choose**:  
   - Active Player: Must take the selected action or do nothing.  
   - Others: Take the action or **Collect Resources**.  
4. **Check endgame conditions**.  
5. **Pass Active Player Token** clockwise.  
Repeat until endgame is triggered.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions  
- **Patrol**: Move 1 Meeple to an adjacent region on the same Territory Card. Cannot cross water or crags.  
- **Quest**: Move 1 Meeple from one Territory Card to any region on another. Must start and end on edge regions.  
- **Build**: Pay Ore equal to next tower level (1st: 1 Ore, 2nd: 2 Ore, etc.). Advance Tower Token. Gain VP at game end.  
- **Research**: Pay Mana equal to next magic level (1st: 1 Mana, etc.). Advance Research Token. Gain access to magic abilities.  
- **Expand**: Add 1 Meeple to a region with one of your Meepees. Pay Food equal to total Meepees you’ll have in play.  
- **Trade**: Discard any number of one resource to gain an equal number of another. Once per action.  

#### Movement & War  
- No more than **2 Meepees** (any color) per region.  
- Cannot attack or be attacked with your **last Meeple**.  
- **War**: Triggered when moving into an occupied region.  
  1. **Set**: Both players secretly set War Die (1–11) or white flag (0). Must afford cost.  
  2. **Reveal**: Higher value wins. Tie → defender wins. Both white flags → **Alliance**.  
  3. **Resolve**: Both pay set cost (Mana=2, Ore=1, Food=0). Loser retreats (pay Food = # Meepees in play) or removes Meeple.  

#### Alliances  
- Two players may coexist in a region.  
- Can peacefully leave via Patrol/Quest.  
- Breaking alliance (war without peace): All shared regions are contested. Loser must retreat or remove Meebles from all shared regions.  

#### Resource Collection  
- On **Collect Resources**, gain 1 resource per occupied region:  
  - Forest → Mana  
  - Mountain → Ore  
  - Plains → Food  
- Max 9 of each resource.  
- If reduced to 1 Meeple, gain **+1 bonus resource** of choice.  

#### Special Regions  
- **Water/Crags**: Impassable unless ability states otherwise.  
- **Capital City**: Worth **2 VP** at game end (1 VP each if allied). No resources.  
- **Ruins**:  
  - Enter → knock Meeple over ("searching").  
  - Collect: Choose any resource.  
  - Cannot move while searching.  
  - Stand up via Patrol (no collect this turn).  
  - At game end: Meebles in ruins are removed before scoring.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Endgame Triggers (game ends after Action Card is cleared):  
- Any player places all **7 Meepees** in play.  
- Any player builds **6th tower level**.  
- Any player reaches **Magic Level 5**.  

#### Scoring:  
- **1 VP** per Meeple in play (not in ruins)  
- **1 VP** per Magic Level  
- **VP** from Tower Level (per Tower Card)  
- **2 VP** per Capital City (1 VP if allied)  
- **+1 VP** per neutral Meeple captured (2-player Lost Kingdom)  
- **+1 VP** per region in Lost Kingdom (2-player)  

#### Tiebreakers (in order):  
1. Most Meebles in play  
2. Highest Tower Level  
3. Highest Magic Level  
4. Most Resources  
5. Tie stands
