## Pirate's Cove — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Pirate's Cove, players become swashbuckling pirates navigating treacherous waters, battling rivals, upgrading their ships, and amassing Fame. In the solo variant, the player must collect 30 Fame points within 60 turns to become the most famed pirate of the Caribbean. The game ends when the Time Marker reaches 0. Victory is achieved by meeting the Fame goal before time runs out.

2. Components  
- Game board with islands and grid-based sea spaces  
- Player ship and pirate ship(s)  
- Score markers (player, Time Marker, Notorious Pirates)  
- Treasure cards (placed on islands)  
- Tavern cards (Fame, Battle, Upgrade, etc.)  
- Dice (at least 2d6)  
- Gold/doubloon tokens  
- Ship upgrade components (Crew, Hull, Sail, Cannon rings)  
- Player board with ship stat tracks  
- Notorious Pirate cards  

3. Setup  
- Place the board and set up Treasure cards on each outer island (1–5).  
- Assign the player ship to Pirate’s Cove.  
- Select two Notorious Pirate cards; ensure they are different colors. Place matching-color score markers on their cards.  
- Place player’s score marker at 0 on the Fame track. Place a Time Marker (different color) at 60.  
- Give player 10 doubloons (not 8).  
- Randomly determine Notorious Pirate starting positions or follow scenario rules.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows this sequence:  
1. TREASURE: Reveal one Treasure card per outer island.  
2. NAVIGATION: Use grid-based movement. Player may move up to Sail value in Movement Points (MP).  
   - Each sea space = 1 MP  
   - Obstacle spaces (rocks, islets) = 2 MP  
   - No diagonal movement  
   - Docking at island costs no MP  
3. COMBAT: Triggered if player and a Notorious Pirate are on the same island.  
   - Fight in order: first pirate moved attacks first.  
   - If both Notorious Pirates dock at player’s island, only the first one attacks.  
   - Special: If Cacafuego is one of the pirates and is defeated, player gains Fame equal to 1d6, but Time Marker moves toward 0 by the same amount.  
4. PLUNDER: After combat or safe docking, attempt to plunder based on island rules:  
   - Tavern Island: Roll Crew dice. Success on ≥1 six. For each 1 rolled, lose 1 turn (drunken crew).  
   - Hull Island: Roll 2 dice. Success if sum ≤ current Hull value.  
   - Sail Island / Crew Island: Roll Crew dice. Success on ≥1 six. For each 1 rolled, lose 1 Crew.  
   - Cannon Island: Defeat Fort (3 cannons). Each hit removes 1 cannon. Fort repairs all cannons at turn end. Fort targets Hull.  
5. UPGRADE: Spend gold to buy upgrades:  
   - Tavern Island: Buy up to 3 Tavern cards (2 gold each)  
   - Hull/Sail/Crew/Cannon Islands: Buy upgrades in respective areas  
   - Treasure Island: Bury treasure (1 Fame per chest, 1 Fame per 3 gold); upgrade any ship section at double cost  
6. END PHASE:  
   - Move each Notorious Pirate: Roll d6; move pirate to island matching roll (1–5).  
   - If pirate lands on player’s island, combat occurs.  
   - Move Time Marker one space toward 0.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Movement Points (MP): Equal to Sail stat. Used to traverse grid.  
- Combat: Standard rules apply. Use dice (hit on 5–6). Target weakest ship section. Battle cards may be played.  
- Plunder Challenges: Vary by island; involve dice rolls and risks (lost turns, crew, or damage).  
- Time Pressure: Game lasts 60 turns max. Time Marker counts down each turn.  
- Cacafuego Effect: Capturing Cacafuego grants Fame but accelerates game end.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Victory Condition: Reach 30 Fame before Time Marker hits 0.  
- Fame Sources:  
  - Plundering islands (value on Treasure card)  
  - Defeating Notorious Pirates (per card value)  
  - Burying treasure (1 Fame per chest)  
  - Burying gold (1 Fame per 3 gold)  
  - Tavern Fame cards (e.g., “I am the master of the seven seas!” = 3 Fame)  
  - Defeating Cacafuego: 1d6 Fame  
- Game End: When Time Marker reaches 0, game ends immediately.  
- Win/Loss: Player wins if Fame ≥30. Otherwise, loses.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I move through multiple obstacle spaces in one turn?  
  A: Yes, as long as you have enough MP. Each obstacle costs 2 MP.  
- Q: What happens if I roll multiple 1s on Tavern Island?  
  A: Lose one turn per 1. These lost turns delay your next action (e.g., skip next turn for each 1).  
- Q: Can I plunder after losing a combat?  
  A: No. If you are defeated or flee, you must return to Pirate’s Cove and cannot plunder.  
- Q: Does Fort damage carry over?  
  A: No. Fort repairs all cannons at the end of each turn.  
- Q: What if both Notorious Pirates roll the same island?  
  A: Both move there. If player is present, only the first pirate (in movement order) attacks.  
- Q: Can I use Tavern cards during solo play?  
  A: Yes. All standard Tavern card effects apply unless restricted by variant rules.
