### 1. Lore & Objective
Empire Builder is a strategic railroad construction and operation game set across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Players act as railroad tycoons investing in track, operating trains, and delivering goods to accumulate wealth. The objective is to be the first player to connect six of the seven major cities with a continuous line of track and possess at least $250 million in cash.

### 2. Components
- 1 erasable map board depicting the U.S., Canada, and Mexico with a grid of mileposts
- 6 wipe-off crayons (one per player color)
- 6 pawns (one per player)
- 100 load chips representing various goods (e.g., coal, cars, wheat)
- 136 demand cards
- 20 event cards
- 12 two-sided locomotive (loco) cards
- Game money (in $1M denominations)
- Plastic chip tray

### 3. Setup
1. Place the board in the center of the table.
2. One player acts as banker, managing money, loco cards, and load chips.
3. Each player receives:
   - $50 million in cash
   - 1 pawn and matching-color crayon
   - 1 freight loco card (base train)
4. Shuffle all demand and event cards together into a draw deck.
5. Deal 3 demand cards face up to each player. Replace any event cards drawn until each player has 3 demand cards.
6. The player with the highest single payout on their demand cards goes first (use tiebreakers if needed).
7. Reshuffle discarded event cards back into the draw deck.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of two phases:
1. **Operations Phase**:
   - Move your train up to its maximum movement (9 or 12 mileposts, depending on train type).
   - Pick up or drop off loads at cities.
   - Deliver goods for cash by fulfilling one demand per card.
   - Pay $4 million per opponent for using their track (paid before movement).
2. **Building Phase**:
   - Spend up to $20 million to either:
     - Build new track segments
     - Upgrade your locomotive

**Exception**: The first two turns per player are **building-only**—no operations occur.

**Switchback Start**: After the first round of building turns, the second round proceeds in reverse order (last player goes first), then normal clockwise play resumes.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Track Building
- Build from:
  - Any major city milepost
  - Any milepost already connected to your track
- Costs per milepost type:
  - Clear: $1M
  - Mountain: $2M
  - Small/Medium City: $3M
  - Major City: $5M
- Additional costs:
  - River crossing: +$2M
  - Lake channel (Great Lakes): +$2M
  - Ocean inlet: Not allowed (solid black boundary)
- Restrictions:
  - Max 2 track segments built *from* major city mileposts per turn
  - Unlimited segments *into* major cities at $5M each
  - Only 3 players may build into a medium city; only 2 into a small city
  - No credit: Must pay immediately; unpaid track is erased

#### Train Movement
- Base train (freight): moves 9 mileposts, carries 2 loads
- Movement types:
  - **Freight / Heavy Freight**: 9 mileposts
  - **Fast Freight / Super Freight**: 12 mileposts
- Trains may:
  - Change direction at any city
  - Use red areas in major cities as shared track
  - Share track with other players (pay $4M/user fee per opponent)
- No movement limit per turn other than train speed

#### Load Management
- Pick up goods in cities where symbols appear (e.g., coal in Cincinnati)
- Limited load chips available (e.g., 4 oil, 3 wheat)
- Deliver one load per demand card for listed cash reward
- After delivery:
  - Return load chip to supply
  - Collect cash from bank
  - Discard demand card
  - Draw new demand card (resolve event cards immediately if drawn)

#### Locomotive Upgrades
- Upgrade at end of turn instead of building
- Costs:
  - Freight → Fast Freight or Heavy Freight: $20M
  - Fast/Heavy → Super Freight: $20M
- Upgrade paths:
  - Speed path: Freight → Fast Freight → Super Freight
  - Capacity path: Freight → Heavy Freight → Super Freight

#### Event Cards
- Drawn when replacing demand cards
- Take immediate effect
- Most remain active until end of drawing player's next turn
- Examples:
  - **Floods**: Destroy bridges over named rivers; no building/movement across until event ends
  - **Derailments**: Lose one load if within 3 mileposts of listed cities; lose next turn
  - **Rail Strikes**: Cannot pick up/deliver at border mileposts
  - **Rail Tax**: Reveal all cash; may trigger penalties

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Winning Conditions**:
  - Connect six of the seven major cities with a continuous track
  - Have ≥ $250 million in cash at end of turn
- When a player meets both conditions:
  - Play continues until all players have taken an equal number of turns
  - If multiple players qualify, highest cash wins
  - Tie: Increase cash goal to $300M; continue play

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I build into a major city more than once?**  
  Yes, unlimited segments may be built *into* major cities at $5M each.
- **Can I build from a major city more than twice per turn?**  
  No—maximum of 2 segments built *from* major city mileposts per turn.
- **What happens if I run out of a load type?**  
  Cannot pick up that good until someone delivers or drops it.
- **Can I move through a flooded river?**  
  No—floods block all movement and rebuilding until event ends.
- **Do I pay to move on my own track?**  
  No—only $4M fee applies when using opponents' track.
- **Can I deliver multiple loads in one turn?**  
  Yes, if movement allows—complete each delivery (return load, collect cash, draw card) before next.
- **What counts as a continuous line?**  
  Any connected path—even with loops or branches—that links six major cities.
