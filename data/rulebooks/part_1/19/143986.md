## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The goal of CV is to craft the life story of a fictional character by collecting cards representing key life events and accomplishments across three life stages: early adulthood, middle age, and old age. Players use dice rolls to acquire cards in areas such as Health, Knowledge, Relationships, Work, and Possessions. These cards provide special abilities and generate symbols used for further purchases. The game ends when the Old Age deck is nearly depleted. Players score points based on card sets, personal and public goals, and possessions. The player with the most points wins, with ties broken by fewer CV cards.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Sort and Place Decks**:  
   - Shuffle and place Early Adulthood, Middle Age, and Old Age decks on the board in order.  
2. **Reveal Initial Cards**:  
   - Reveal the top 5 cards from the Early Adulthood deck and place them face-up on the track.  
3. **Life Goals**:  
   - Deal 1 private Life Goal card to each player (kept secret).  
   - Reveal (number of players – 1) public Life Goal cards and place them face-up on the board.  
4. **Childhood Draft**:  
   - Combine the Bicycle card with:
     - 5 random Childhood cards (2 players)
     - 8 random Childhood cards (3 players)
     - 11 random Childhood cards (4 players)
   - Shuffle and deal 3 cards to each player.  
   - Conduct a draft: each player keeps 1 card and passes the other 2 left; then keeps 1 of the 2 received and passes the last left. Each player ends with 3 Childhood cards.  
5. **Starting Player**:  
   - The player who has the Bicycle card reveals it, takes the Bicycle token, and becomes the starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds clockwise. Each player completes all phases in turn.

#### Phase 1: Roll and Reroll Dice  
- Roll 4 dice. Maximum dice allowed: 7 (via card effects).  
- You may reroll any dice **twice**, but **dice showing Bad Luck (◐) are frozen and cannot be rerolled**.  

#### Phase 2: Buy Cards  
- Buy **up to 2 cards** from the track and **up to 1 Fate card** (if available).  
- Pay using:
  - Dice symbols rolled
  - Tokens from active cards
  - Event cards (from hand; fully expended when used)
- **Unused symbols are lost**.  
- **3 Good Luck symbols (⊙)**: Can be used to buy any card (still must meet special conditions).  
- **Special Conditions**: Must be met even when using 3 Good Luck (e.g., “You have a job” must be true).  

#### Phase 3: Bad Luck Consequences  
- For every **3 Bad Luck symbols (◐)** (from dice + tokens), discard **1 active (top) card** from your CV.  
- **3 unused Bad Luck symbols trigger loss of 1 active card** (no Gossip or Fate cards can be lost this way).  

#### Phase 4: Pay Card Costs  
- **Active cards with red slash (cost)** must be paid now (during “Add to CV” phase).  
- Use dice or tokens; **symbols used to buy cards cannot be reused**.  
- If cost cannot be paid, **discard the card**.  
- **Costs are paid starting the next turn**, not immediately after purchase.  

#### Phase 5: Add Cards to CV or Hand  
- **Non-Event Cards**: Add to CV stacks:
  - **Health, Relationship, Knowledge**: Place **anywhere** in the stack (top or under).  
  - **Work, Possession**: Must go on **top** of the stack.  
- **Event Cards (lightning icon)**: Add to hand (single-use, discarded after play).  
- **Dual-Type Cards** (two colors/icons): Choose type when adding. If you have no stack of either type, delay choice until one is established.  
- **Gossip Cards**: Can be added to **any player’s CV** (per card effect).  

#### Phase 6: Cleanup  
- **Refill Track**:  
  - Move remaining cards left.  
  - Fill empty spaces from current age deck (Early → Middle → Old).  
- **Deck Runs Out?** → Trigger **Social Assistance** (see below) **immediately**, before continuing refill.  
- **Discard Leftmost Card**:
  - **3–4 players**: After each full round (after last player’s turn).  
  - **2 players**: After **each player’s turn** (simulates AI play).  
- **Fate Card**: If no Fate card was bought this round, discard the leftmost one.  
- **Update Tokens**: Set tokens to match symbols on **active (top) cards** of each stack.  
  - Tokens do **not accumulate**; they reflect current active card effects.  

#### Social Assistance  
- Triggered **each time** an age deck (Early, Middle, Old) runs out.  
- **Eligibility**: A player qualifies if **another player has ≥2× as many CV cards**.  
- **Effect**: Eligible players (in clockwise order, starting with current player) take **1 card from the track for free** (no cost).  
- **Must still meet special conditions** (e.g., job requirement).  
- **Occurs even at end of game**.  
- **Does not refill track** during resolution.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### CV Stacks & Active Cards  
- Each card type (Health, Knowledge, Relationship, Work, Possession) forms a stack.  
- Only the **top card** is active and provides its effect.  
- **Health/Knowledge/Relationship**: New card can be placed on top or under.  
- **Work/Possession**: New card **must go on top**.  
- **Cannot rearrange stacks** outside of “Add to CV” phase (except via card effects like Coaching).  

#### Card Effects & Symbols  
- **Good Luck (⊙)**: 3 can substitute for any card cost.  
- **Bad Luck (◐)**: Triggers misfortune (lose active card) at 3×.  
- **Die Symbol (◐)**: Grants +1 die (max 7).  
- **Reroll Symbol**: Grants +1 reroll.  
- **Arrow Symbols**: Convert any number of left-side symbols to right-side (and vice versa if double arrow).  
- **Joker (◐)**: Counts as Health, Relationship, Knowledge, or Money.  

#### Special Card Rules  
- **Card with Cost (Red Slash)**: Paid at start of “Add to CV” phase each turn. Unpaid = discard.  
- **Dual-Type Cards**: Choose type on acquisition; if no stack exists, delay choice.  
- **Cards with “Double Count” (e.g., Marathon Runner, Professor)**: Active card causes its stack to score **double** at endgame (counts as 2 cards for scoring).  
- **Gossip Cards**: May impose restrictions (e.g., prevent card types, reduce rerolls). Some trigger immediate effects (e.g., Coaching allows rearrangement).  

#### Token Usage  
- Tokens represent symbols from **active cards**.  
- Reset each turn to match current active effects.  
- Cannot be saved between turns.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Trigger  
- At the **end of a round**, after refilling the track from the **Old Age deck**, if the deck has **fewer cards than the number of players**, the game ends.  

#### Scoring  
1. **Health, Knowledge, Relationships**:  
   - Score $1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n$ points, where $n$ = number of cards in stack.  
   - **Capped at 10 cards** → max 55 points per stack.  
2. **Possessions**:  
   - Sum VP values printed on each card.  
3. **Gossips**:  
   - 2 VP per card.  
4. **Private Goals**:  
   - All players score their own private goal if fulfilled.  
5. **Public Goals**:  
   - Only the **best player(s)** score each public goal.  
   - Ties: **All tied players** score full points.  

#### Tiebreaker  
1. Most points → winner.  
2. **Tie?** → Fewer total CV cards wins.  
3. **Still tied?** → Shared victory.

  Yes. Changed symbol is **no longer Bad Luck** → doesn’t count toward misfortune.
