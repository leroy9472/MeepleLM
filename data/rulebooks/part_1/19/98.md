## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Axis & Allies is a strategic-level World War II board game where players control major world powers: the Axis (Germany and Japan) or the Allies (USSR, United Kingdom, and the United States). The game begins in spring 1942.  

- **Allies Win** by capturing both Axis capitals: Germany and Japan.  
- **Axis Win** by either:  
  - Capturing two of the three Allied capitals (Russia, United Kingdom, Eastern USA), or  
  - Achieving an economic victory with a combined National Production Level (NPL) of 84 IPCs at the end of a full round.  

Economic victory is tracked via the National Production Chart, which reflects territory control and IPC income.  

### 2. Components  
- Game board (world map with land territories and sea zones)  
- Plastic unit counters (color-coded by nation: USSR/brown, Germany/grey, UK/beige, Japan/yellow, USA/green)  
- Industrial Production Certificates (IPCs) in denominations of 1, 5, and 10  
- Control markers (used for territory ownership and tracking NPL)  
- 6 six-sided dice (combat resolution and R&D)  
- Reference charts (unit stats, setup, order of play)  
- Battle board (for resolving combat)  
- Plastic chips (unit counters: white = 1, red = 5)  

### 3. Setup  
#### Player Assignment  
- **2-player**: One controls all Allies (USSR, UK, USA); other controls Axis (Germany, Japan).  
- **3-player**: One controls all Allies; others control Germany and Japan.  
- **4-player**: USSR/USA, UK, Germany, Japan.  
- **5-player**: Each controls one power.  

#### Order of Play  
1. USSR → 2. Germany → 3. UK → 4. Japan → 5. USA  

#### Initial IPCs  
- USSR: 24  
- Germany: 32  
- UK: 30  
- Japan: 25  
- USA: 36  

Each player receives IPCs based on starting NPL. Units are placed per reference cards. Control markers are placed on the National Production Chart at starting values.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each player’s turn consists of six phases:  
1. **Develop Weapons & Purchase Units**  
2. **Combat Movement**  
3. **Combat**  
4. **Non-Combat Movement**  
5. **Mobilize New Units**  
6. **Collect Income**  

Turns proceed in fixed order. A full round ends after all five powers complete their turns.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Unit Movement  
- **Infantry**: 1 land territory  
- **Tanks**: 2 land territories; may “blitz” through unoccupied enemy territory  
- **Fighters**: 4 movement points; must land within range  
- **Bombers**: 6 movement points; cannot land on carriers  
- **Naval Units**: 2 sea zones; first zone must be friendly unless submerging  
- **Transports**: Carry 2 infantry, 1 tank, or 1 AA gun + 1 infantry; may “bridge” between adjacent coastal territories without moving  

#### Combat  
Combat is resolved per territory or sea zone. The attacker rolls first, then the defender.  

**Land Combat Sequence**:  
1. AA Gun fires (1 die per attacking plane; hit on 1)  
2. Attacker rolls for all units  
3. Defender rolls for all units (including casualties)  
4. Remove casualties  
5. Repeat or retreat  

**Naval Combat Sequence**:  
1. Attacking submarines fire first (first shot attack; no return fire)  
2. Attacker rolls for remaining units  
3. Defender rolls for all units  
4. Remove casualties  
5. Submarines may withdraw  
6. Repeat or retreat  

**Amphibious Assaults**:  
- Sea zone must be cleared of enemy naval units before unloading.  
- Battleships may provide one “shore bombardment” shot per battle (attack at 4 or less).  
- If battleship fights in sea battle, it cannot bombard.  
- Land units cannot retreat once unloaded.  

#### Air Units  
- Fighters may land on friendly carriers or territories.  
- Must have legal landing space before movement.  
- Cannot land in a territory captured during the same turn.  
- AA guns fire when planes enter or overfly their territory (1 die per plane; hit on 1).  

#### Weapons Development (Optional)  
- Cost: 5 IPCs per research die.  
- Roll all dice; if any die shows 6, roll again to determine tech.  
- Technologies include:  
  - Jet Power (fighters defend on 5 or less)  
  - Super Submarines (subs attack on 3 or less)  
  - Heavy Bombers (bombers roll 3 dice when attacking)  
  - Rockets (AA guns can attack enemy ICs once per turn)  
- Only one tech per turn; reroll duplicates.  

#### Industrial Complexes (ICs)  
- New units are placed in territories with ICs you’ve controlled since the start of your turn.  
- Original ICs allow unlimited unit placement.  
- Captured or newly built ICs produce up to the territory’s IPC value.  
- Only one IC per territory.  

#### Capturing Capitals  
- Capturing an enemy capital:  
  - Gain all unspent IPCs from the owner.  
  - Owner cannot collect income or buy units until capital is liberated.  
- If your capital is captured:  
  - You lose all IPCs.  
  - You cannot collect income until liberation.  
  - If you capture an enemy capital while your own is held, you collect their IPCs and may spend them immediately.  

#### Neutrality  
- First player to enter a neutral territory pays 3 IPCs to the bank.  
- That player controls the territory and gains its IPC value.  
- Subsequent entries by any player are free.  

#### Multinational Forces  
- Units from allied powers may share territories and defend together.  
- Each player rolls separately for their own units during defense.  
- The attacker chooses which allied power takes casualties first.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Allied Victory**: Capture both Germany and Japan.  
- **Axis Victory**:  
  - Capture two Allied capitals, or  
  - Achieve combined NPL of 84 IPCs at the end of a full round.  
- Victory is checked after Japan’s turn (Allies) and after USA’s turn (Axis).  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you retreat from an amphibious assault?**  
  No. Land units cannot retreat once unloaded. Air units may retreat.  
- **Can a fighter land on a carrier that moved?**  
  Yes, but only if the carrier’s movement was declared during combat movement.  
- **Can you attack with bombers and conduct a strategic bombing raid in the same turn?**  
  No. A bomber may do one or the other, not both.  
- **What happens if a carrier is sunk with fighters on it?**  
  Surviving fighters have 1 movement point to land on a friendly territory or carrier in the same sea zone.  
- **Can you place units in a territory with a captured IC on the same turn?**  
  No. You must control the IC since the start of your turn to use it.
