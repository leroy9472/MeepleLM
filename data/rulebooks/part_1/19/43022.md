# Yomi Clarified Rules (v1.4, 11/2/11)

## 1. Lore & Objective
The objective of Yomi is to reduce your opponent’s Life Points to 0. Each player uses a character-specific deck that reflects their fighting style and abilities. Victory comes through strategic card play, timing, and reading your opponent’s intentions.

## 2. Components
- Character Deck (54 cards): Includes combat cards (Attacks, Throws, Blocks, Dodges, Jokers, Aces, and special moves), Character Card, and Rules Summary card.
- Character Card: Displays the character's unique ability, life total (shown in heart icon), and combo limit.
- Health Trackers (optional): Physical HP cards or tokens to track life total.
- Playmat (optional): Used to organize card placement during play.

## 3. Setup
1. Each player selects a character deck.
2. Remove the Character Card and Rules Summary card from the deck and set them aside.
3. Shuffle the remaining 52 cards.
4. Draw 7 cards to form your starting hand.
5. Determine life total from the heart icon on your Character Card.
6. Place decks within reach. The player with lower life total goes first for ability resolution (initiative).

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of three phases:

### 4.1 Draw Phase
- Both players draw one card from their deck.
- On the first turn, skip this phase (starting hand already drawn).
- After drawing, any “After Draw Phase” abilities may be used, in initiative order (lower life total acts first).

### 4.2 Combat Phase
1. **Choose Moves**:  
   - Each player selects a card from their hand and places it face down.  
   - Most cards have two actions (e.g., Attack on one end, Throw on the other). Orient the card so the chosen move is closest to the opponent.  
   - Alternatively, a player may declare “No Card.”

2. **Reveal Combat Cards**:  
   - Reveal both cards simultaneously by flipping them left-to-right to preserve orientation.  
   - If a player played an Ace requiring additional Aces from hand, they must fulfill the cost now.  
     - If unable, reveal hand to prove impossibility, discard the Ace, and treat as “No Card.” Opponent may re-choose their combat card.

3. **Determine Combat Winner**:  
   The following hierarchy applies:
   - **Attack** beats Throw, loses to Block, Dodge, Joker.
   - **Throw** beats Block, Dodge, loses to Attack, Joker.
   - **Block** beats Attack, Joker; ties with Block/Dodge; loses to Throw.
   - **Dodge** beats Attack, Joker; ties with Block/Dodge; loses to Throw.
   - **Joker** beats Attack, Throw; ties with Joker; loses to Block, Dodge.
   - **No Card** loses to all.

   **Tie Resolution**:
   - Attack vs Attack: Lower speed wins. Equal speed = both deal damage, no extra damage allowed.
   - Throw vs Throw: Lower speed wins. Equal speed = no damage.
   - Block vs Block, Dodge vs Dodge: No damage, tie harmlessly.

   **Special Outcomes**:
   - **Block wins**: Return Block to hand. If blocking an Attack with blue shield value, take block damage (does not count as a hit).
   - **Block ties**: Return Block to hand. No draw.
   - **Block wins vs Joker**: Return Block to hand and draw a card.
   - **Dodge wins**: May Add Extra Damage as if it were an Attack.
   - **Joker wins or ties**: Player may search for 2 Aces (optional, even if no Aces in discard).
   - **Throw wins**: Deals damage, may Add Extra Damage.
   - **Attack wins**: Deals damage, may Add Extra Damage.

   **Knockdown Rules**:
   - If a player is Knocked Down, their odd-numbered Blocks lose to even-numbered Attacks (and vice versa).
   - Dodges always lose when Knocked Down.

4. **Add Extra Damage (Winner Only)**:
   The winner may extend their action with:
   - **Pumping**: Discard cards to add damage (as specified on the winning card).
   - **Comboing**: Play additional Attacks or Throws that legally follow.

   **Combo Rules**:
   - Combo size cannot exceed character’s combo limit (shown as filled/unfilled circles on cards).
   - Combo Types:
     - **Starter**: Can only begin a combo (or follow a winning Dodge).
     - **Linker**: Can follow any card except Ender; any card can follow.
     - **Normal Attack (numbered 2–10)**: Can follow Starter, Linker, or previous number (e.g., 5 after 4).
     - **Ender**: Can follow any card (except another Ender); nothing can follow.
     - **Can’t Combo**: Cannot combo into or out of, except after a winning Dodge (then treated as Ender).
   - After a winning Dodge: Any card (even Starter or “Can’t Combo”) may be played, but becomes an Ender.

   **Time Rewind (Defender Response)**:
   - If the defender lost combat and further damage is possible, they may play a face-down card before the combo begins.
   - After the combo, reveal:
     - **Joker**: Prevents all combo damage (but not knockdown or non-damage effects). Draw 2 cards.
     - **Non-Joker**: Bluff – discard with no effect.
   - Cannot bluff if no damage can be added (e.g., un-pumpable Ender).

   **Knockdown Trigger**:
   - If the final card in the combo (or original combat card, if no combo) has the Knocks Down icon, the opponent is Knocked Down next turn.

5. **End of Combat**:
   - Discard all combat cards used (including pumped or comboed cards).
   - The Knocked Down status ends after one full round unless re-applied.

### 4.3 Power-Up Phase
Players may search for Aces from deck or discard pile:
- **From Combos**: Search for Aces equal to (longest chain of sequential normal attacks) minus 2.  
  Example: 4 in a row → search for 2 Aces. (Valerie can go up to 6 in a row → 4 Aces.)
- **From Discards**: Discard sets:
  - Pair → 1 Ace
  - 3-of-a-kind → 2 Aces
  - 4-of-a-kind → 3 Aces
- You may perform multiple discards and searches.
- You may take fewer Aces than entitled only if no Aces remain in discard pile.
- If you search your deck, shuffle afterward.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Combo Points**: Each card uses combo points (black circles). Total combo cannot exceed character’s limit.
- **Knockdown**: Lasts one round. Weakens defense: odd/even block mismatch fails; Dodges always lose.
- **Ace Costs**: Mandatory costs paid on reveal. Failure = hand reveal, discard Ace, treated as No Card.
- **Initiative**: Player with lower life total acts first during ability windows.
- **Countering**: Some abilities (e.g., Smoke Bomb) can counter others. Played after cost payment, prevents all effects and refunds costs.
- **Searching for Aces**: Can pull from discard or deck. Must continue until quota met or discard pile has no Aces.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends when a player’s Life Points reach 0.
- No draws: continued play until one player wins.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you play a “Can’t Combo” card after a Dodge?**  
  Yes. It becomes an Ender.
- **Can you play a Starter after a Dodge?**  
  Yes. It becomes an Ender.
- **Can you bluff after losing to a non-damaging Ender?**  
  No. Only if further damage is possible (e.g., pumpable or comboable move).
- **Can Dodges be played while Knocked Down?**  
  Yes, but they always lose.
- **Can you search for Aces with Valerie’s Agile Hands even with non-sequential attacks?**  
  Yes. As long as normals are played in a row, they count for chain bonus.
- **Does Time Rewind prevent ability damage?**  
  No. Only combat damage (from Attacks/Throws). Ability damage (e.g., Bubble Shield, Stone Wall) still applies.
- **Do Aces count as 1 or 11 in Poker Flourish?**  
  Both. Straights can be A-5 or 10-A.
- **Can Jokers be wild in Poker Flourish?**  
  No. Jokers are never wild in Yomi.
