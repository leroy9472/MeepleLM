### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action 1: Place a Master Tile  
- Take **one** Master tile from your supply.  
- Place it on an **empty matching symbol space** in a village **where you already have at least one Master** of your color.  
- Cannot place if no Master of your color is present.  
- Only **one** Master may be placed per turn.  

#### Action 2: Recruit Students  
- Take up to **two** tiles from your supply and place them **atop existing Masters** of your color with matching symbols.  
- These become **Students**.  
- A Master may have **at most one Student** at any time.  
- You may place:  
  - Two Students (on two different Masters)  
  - One Student (if only one eligible Master)  
  - Zero Students (but this is not allowed — you must place at least one if possible)  
- Students may be placed in same or different villages.  

#### Action 3: Begin the Journey of the Students  
**Prerequisite**: You must have **at least one Student** in the starting village.  

**Process**:  
- Choose a village where you have at least one Student.  
- **All Students** (yours and opponents’) in that village **journey together** to an adjacent village via an **unbroken bridge**.  
- The active player chooses the destination (must be directly connected).  
- After movement: **remove the bridge** from the board (out of the game).  
- A **Stone of the Wise Men** is placed on a village when **all its connecting paths have broken bridges**. No actions can occur in such a village.  

**Journey Outcomes** (based on village strength):  

**Strength** = total number of **Masters + Students** (all players) in the village.  
- If strengths are **equal**, compare number of **Masters only**.  
- If still tied, the **destination village is stronger**.  

##### Situation 1: Starting Village is Stronger  
- Students may **displace opposing tiles**.  
- For each Student arriving:  
  - If the matching symbol space is **empty** → Student becomes a **Master** (tile placed on space).  
  - If occupied by **own Master** → Student is placed **atop** it (remains Student).  
  - If occupied by **own Master + own Student** → Journeying Student returns to supply.  
  - If occupied by **any opponent’s tile(s)** → remove opponent’s tile(s) to their supply, place your Student as **Master** in the space.  

##### Situation 2: Starting Village is Weaker or Equal (destination stronger)  
- Students **cannot displace** any tiles.  
- For each Student arriving:  
  - If the matching symbol space is **empty** → Student becomes a **Master**.  
  - If the space is **occupied** (by any tile) → Journeying Student is **returned to owner’s supply**.  

**Important**:  
- Only **Students** journey. **Masters never move**.  
- All Students in the starting village must journey.  
- Bridge breaks **immediately** after the journey.  
- A Stone is placed on a village when **all paths are severed**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Trigger**: When the **12th Stone of the Wise Men** is placed on the board.  
- One village will remain without a Stone (still active).  

**Scoring**:  
- Players count **only Master tiles** on the board (Students do not count).  
- **Winner**: Player with the most Masters.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player who occupies more **villages** (has at least one Master in more villages).  
  - Example: Red and Blue both have 17 Masters. Red has Masters in 7 villages, Blue in 6 → Red wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a Master in a village with only my Student?**  
  No. To place a Master, you must have a **Master tile** of your color already in the village. Students do not count.  

- **Can a Student ever stay in a village without becoming a Master or being removed?**  
  No. On arrival, a Student either:  
  - Becomes a Master (on empty space)  
  - Stays as Student (on own Master)  
  - Is returned to supply (if space occupied or journeying from weaker village)  

- **Can I journey from a weaker to stronger village?**  
  Yes, but it's risky. Students are removed if their discipline’s space is occupied. Only beneficial if:  
  - You can claim an empty space  
  - You want to break a bridge proactively  
  - You prevent opponents from using that route  

- **Can a village lose its last bridge and immediately get a Stone?**  
  Yes. After a bridge breaks, check if **all paths** from the village are broken. If so, place a Stone.  

- **Can I recruit a Student onto a Master that already has one?**  
  No. A Master may have **at most one Student** at any time.  

- **Can I choose not to move all Students during a Journey?**  
  No. **All** Students in the starting village must journey.  

- **Do removed tiles go back to the supply?**  
  Yes. Displaced Masters or returned Students go back to their owner’s supply and may be reused.
