## Blood Moon Expansion - Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Welcome back to Yarnham, where the rising moon exerts a growing influence over hunters and monsters alike. As the night deepens and the blood moon rises, the darkness amplifies both danger and madness. This expansion introduces dynamic environmental effects that evolve throughout the game, increasing tension and challenge in line with the moon’s cycle.

The objective remains aligned with the base game: defeat all monsters and bosses to clear the hunt. However, the Blood Moon Expansion modifies gameplay through evolving environmental conditions based on progress in defeating bosses.

### 3. Setup
1. Set up the base game as normal.
2. Choose one of the two modes of play:
   - **Moon Cycle Mode** (recommended): Sequentially introduce cards based on boss defeats.
   - **Difficulty Level Mode**: Select one card (Sunset, Nightfall, or Blood Moon) to remain in effect for the entire game.

3. In **Moon Cycle Mode**:
   - Place the **Sunset** card beside the monster pile at the start of the game.
   - When the first boss is defeated, replace it with **Nightfall** (cover Sunset).
   - When the second boss is defeated, replace Nightfall with **Blood Moon**.

4. In **Difficulty Level Mode**:
   - Place one chosen card (Sunset, Nightfall, or Blood Moon) beside the monster pile.
   - Apply its effect for the entire game.

Only one card’s effects are active at a time.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Play proceeds according to base game rules.
- The active moon phase card applies its effects continuously during the game.
- In **Moon Cycle Mode**, transition between phases occurs immediately upon defeating each boss.
- No player actions are required to trigger phase changes—only boss defeat.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Active Effect Rule**: Only the topmost/active card’s effects are in play.
- **Progression Trigger**: Advancement in Moon Cycle is tied directly to boss defeats:
  - 0 bosses defeated → Sunset
  - 1 boss defeated → Nightfall
  - 2 bosses defeated → Blood Moon
- Effects of each card (as implied by structure):
  - Each phase likely introduces escalating difficulty or thematic changes (e.g., increased aggression, hunter instability, enhanced monster abilities).
  - Specific mechanical effects must be printed on the cards themselves (not detailed in source).

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- End game conditions are unchanged from the base game.
- Victory is achieved when all required monsters and bosses are defeated.
- The expansion modifies gameplay difficulty and dynamics but does not alter scoring or win/loss conditions.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Q: Can multiple moon cards be active at once?**  
  A: No. Only the current phase card (Sunset, Nightfall, or Blood Moon) has active effect.

- **Q: When exactly does the phase change occur?**  
  A: Immediately after a boss is defeated. Resolve the defeat, then update the moon phase.

- **Q: Does defeating a boss with a special ability or event count?**  
  A: Yes. Any boss defeat counts toward progression, regardless of method.

- **Q: What if there are fewer than two bosses?**  
  A: The Blood Moon phase will not be reached. Progression stops at the final available phase.

- **Q: Can Difficulty Level Mode use Blood Moon from the start?**  
  A: Yes. Players may choose Blood Moon for maximum difficulty from turn one.
