## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players represent spacefaring factions exploring a galaxy filled with ancient alien ruins and strategic resources. The goal is to gain the most Victory Points (VP) by expanding across planets, developing advanced technologies, building cities, and defeating opponents. Victory is achieved through a combination of territorial control, technological supremacy, and military dominance.

The game ends when the last VP token is taken; the active player finishes their turn, then all others take one final turn. The player with the most VP wins. Ties are broken first by in-game VP, then by total technology levels developed.

### 3. Setup  
1. Assemble game board with 4 quadrants.  
2. Place each player’s Homeworld in designated hole (face up).  
3. Shuffle planets face down and place in non-Homeworld holes per quadrant.  
4. Each player places:  
   - 6 Troops in their Supply  
   - 2 Starships in orbit of their Homeworld  
5. Set VP pool:  
   - 2 players: 32 VP  
   - 3 players: 36 VP  
   - 4 players: 40 VP  
6. Place technology markers at level 0 on each color track.  
7. Choose starting player (play proceeds clockwise).

*Note:* Homeworlds are not planets—they cannot be mined, built on, attacked, or blockaded. Only used for recruiting and launching.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, perform **one** of the following actions:

#### 1) Recruit Troops  
- Move up to 2 Troops from Supply to any planets you occupy or your Homeworld.

Each of the following costs 1 movement point:

  - Level 1: 1 lab  
  - Level 2: 2 labs  
  - Level 3: 3 labs  
  - Level 4: 4 labs

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Resolving Attacks (After Movement)  
All eligible attacking ships **must** attack. Each ship may attack **once**.

**Attacks on Starships:**  
- 2 of your Starships (or 1 Battleship) within short range → destroy enemy Starship → +1 VP  
- 3 of your Starships within short range → destroy enemy Battleship → +2 VP  

**Attacks on Planets:**  
- Only if planet is **undefended** (no enemy ships in orbit)  
- Your orbiting ships > planet’s Defense → destroy **all items** on planet → +1 VP per item destroyed  
- Defense values:  
  - Troop: +1  
  - Colony: +1  
  - City: +2  
  - Research Lab: +1 (only with Pink3 tech)  

**Tech Bonuses:**  
- Orange: Attack at long range  
- Orange2: Attack multiple targets (e.g., ship then planet)  
- Orange4: +1 VP per ship destroyed  
- Pink3: Starship in orbit gives +2 strength (vs. Battleship)  

#### Blockades  
- Planet is **blockaded** if enemy has ship(s) in orbit  
- On blockaded planet, you cannot:  
  - Recruit  
  - Build  
  - Land  
  - Launch  
  - Mine  
  - Develop tech (labs on blockaded planets don’t count)  
- Exception: Grey2 tech allows Launch/Land on blockaded planets  

#### Ramming  
- Only occurs when **your flicked ship hits enemy ship**  
- Both ships destroyed (returned to Supply)  
- No VP unless:  
  - Pink2: +2 VP if your ship is rammed (by enemy flick)  
  - Pink4: +1 VP when you initiate ram  

#### Item Limits  
- Max **3 items** per planet (any combination of troops, colonies, cities, labs)  
- Only one Research Lab per planet (except one planet may have two)  
- Cannot voluntarily remove structures  

#### Homeworld Rules  
- Not a planet  
- Can recruit and launch only  
- Cannot be attacked, blockaded, mined, or built on

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Trigger:** When the last VP token is taken from the supply.  
- Active player finishes turn  
- All other players take **one final turn**  
- Additional VPs may be taken from box if earned

**Final Scoring:**  
- 1 VP per occupied Planet or Asteroid  
- 1 VP per Colony  
- 2 VP per City  
- 3 VP for having Cities in 3 different Quadrants  
- 6 VP for having Cities in 4 different Quadrants  

**In-Game VP Sources:**  
- Mine: 1 or 2 VP  
- Destroy enemy Starship: 1 VP  
- Destroy enemy Battleship: 2 VP  
- Take enemy planet: 1 VP per item destroyed  
- First to tech level N: N VP  
- Ramming: Pink4 = +1 VP, Pink2 = +2 VP if rammed  

**Tiebreakers:**  
1. Most in-game VP  
2. Highest total tech levels developed

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I remove structures voluntarily?**  
A: No. Structures remain until destroyed in attack.

**Q: Can I recruit to a face-down planet?**  
A: Yes, if you have Brown4 tech. Planet is revealed when Troop is placed.

**Q: Do destroyed structures come back?**  
A: Yes. All destroyed items return to owner’s supply and can be rebuilt.

**Q: Can I gain more than 8 tech levels?**  
A: Yes. If you rebuild labs, you can exceed original limits and develop higher tech.

**Q: What counts as “in orbit”?**  
A: Any part of ship touching planet’s colored area.

**Q: Can I ram by placing ship next to enemy?**  
A: No. Ram requires **flicking and collision**.

**Q: Can I attack after launching?**  
A: Yes. Launched ships can attack same turn.

**Q: Can a planet be both defended and blockaded?**  
A: Yes. Defense prevents attack; blockade restricts actions.

**Q: Do I get bonus when rebuilding a city?**  
A: Yes. Each time you build a City (even replacement), gain +1 Troop or +1 Starship.
