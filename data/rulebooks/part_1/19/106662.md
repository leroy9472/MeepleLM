### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of four phases, in order:

#### Phase 1: Buy Tech / Food Rot (Player Order)  
1. **Place Food**: Add 1 field crop to the lowest-numbered tech card in the market.  
2. **Tech Purchase**:  
   - A player may offer to buy a tech from the available row.  
   - All players may choose to buy it **before** the offering player, in player order.  
   - The **last player** in turn order who wants the card gets priority to buy it.  
   - If no one buys it, the **offering player must buy it**.  
   - Max: 1 tech purchase per player per round.  
3. **Limits**:  
   - Max 3 tool cards (duplicates allowed). Buying a 4th requires discarding one.  
   - Unlimited knowledge cards (no duplicates).  
4. **Discard Free Food**:  
   - If a newly drawn tech card is lower than the card with the free food, discard the food.  
   - If the card with free food remains unsold, discard it.  
5. **Food Rot**:  
   - Players without the **Fire** knowledge card discard 1/3 of their food (round down).  

#### Phase 2: Hunting & Feeding (Reverse Player Order)  
1. **Hunting**:  
   - For each **tool**, if you have a clan member adjacent to a matching hunting area, collect food as per the tool’s table.  
   - **Multiple Sources**: For each additional matching hunting area adjacent to your clan, add 1 “virtual token” to the harvest supply when resolving.  
   - **Multiple Tools**: Tools of the same type must be used one at a time, in any order.  
   - **Field & Herbs**: Always provide fixed food (Field: 1 crop; Herbs: as specified).  
2. **Feeding**:  
   - Spend 1 food per clan member.  
   - If unable to feed all, remove unfed members (clan must remain connected).  

#### Phase 3: Spread Clan (Reverse Player Order)  
- Add up to 5 new clan members, maintaining adjacency.  
- **Cost (food)**:  
  | New Members | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |  
  |-------------|---|---|---|---|---|  
  | Cost        | 1 | 3 | 6 |10 |15 |  
- **Additional Costs**:  
  - +1 food per mountain crossed.  
  - +n food if placing in a space as the **n-th player** (n ≥ 2).  
    - Example: placing as 3rd in a space costs +3 food.  
- **2 Players Only**:  
  - 2nd player spreads the **neutral clan** to match the size of the 1st player’s clan before their own spread.  

#### Phase 4: Bureaucracy  
1. **Update Turn Order**:  
   - Rank by clan size (largest first).  
   - Tie: highest tech card number.  
2. **Refill Food Supply**:  
   - Add base supply + 1 per matching hunting area on the board.  
3. **Tech Market Update**:  
   - Remove the highest-numbered tech card from the market and place it under the deck.  
   - Draw a replacement.  
   - **Exception**: After Shuffle card is drawn, this no longer occurs.  
4. **Shuffle Card Effects**:  
   - When drawn:  
     - Place it as the highest-numbered card in the market.  
     - Shuffle the remaining deck.  
     - Proceed normally.  
   - When **in market during Bureaucracy**:  
     - Discard the Shuffle card and the lowest-numbered tech card.  
     - Reduce market to 6 cards (all available).  
     - **2 Players**: Market reduces to 4 cards.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I decline a tech in 2-player?**  
  - Yes. 1st player may offer a tech; 2nd may decline. 1st may then discard it (if tool, remove matching food from supply).  
- **What if the Shuffle card is drawn early?**  
  - Place it at top of market, shuffle deck, continue. Only during Bureaucracy does it trigger market shrinkage.  
- **Can I have multiple Fields?**  
  - Yes, if you buy multiple Tool cards of Field (allowed as duplicate).  
- **Does Speech reduce spreading cost?**  
  - Yes. If you have **Speech**, you **do not pay +n** when entering already occupied spaces.  
- **Neutral Clan (2P)**:  
  - Only 2nd player spreads it. It grows to match 1st player’s size each round.  
- **Refilling Food**:  
  - Always refill to base + number of hunting areas on board.  
- **Updating Turn Order**:  
  - After every phase that changes clan size or tech ownership.
