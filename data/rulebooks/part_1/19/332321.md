# 4. Gameplay Flow

Each turn consists of two phases, performed in order:

1. **Crew Action Phase:**  
   The active player performs up to the number of actions shown on their Crew Placard. Actions include Move, Pick Up/Drop, Use an Item, Craft, Trade, Special Action, or CRAFT.
2. **Encounter Phase:**  
   Draw and resolve the top Encounter Card from the deck. Resolve all effects top to bottom.  
   Play then passes clockwise to the next player.

# 5. Core Mechanics

**Actions (per Crew Action Phase):**
- **MOVE:** Move to an adjacent corridor or room, or use ladders between levels.
- **PICK UP/DROP:** Spend 1 action to pick up or drop any number of Scrap tokens, or 1 Item.  
  Inventory limits: 3 Items, 1 Coolant Canister, unlimited Scrap.
- **USE AN ITEM:** Use an item’s ability (some require an action, others are passive).
- **CRAFT:** Discard Scrap tokens equal to an Item’s cost to craft it. Place in inventory.
- **TRADE:** In the same room or corridor, freely exchange Scrap or Items with other crew.
- **SPECIAL ACTION:** Use unique ability on Crew Placard (e.g., Ripley can move another crew member).

**Encounter Phase:**
- Draw and resolve one Encounter Card.
- **Place Tokens:** If instructed, place a Concealed Token (if none present) and Scrap Tokens.
- **Alien Encounter:** Move Alien toward nearest crew. If it reaches a crew member:
  - Lose Morale equal to the card’s value.
  - Affected crew must flee 3 spaces.
- **Alien Movement:** The Alien moves toward the closest crew, using ladders. If multiple are equidistant, the crew chooses.

**Encountering a Concealed Token:**
When a crew member enters a room with a Concealed Token:
- Reveal it and resolve:
  - **SAFE:** Nothing happens. Shuffle back.
  - **SURPRISE ATTACK:** Move Alien into room. Lose Morale. Affected crew flee 3 spaces. Skip Encounter Phase.
  - **JONESY:** Lose 1 Morale. Shuffle back.

**Morale:**
- Track on Crew Morale Track.
- Losing Morale moves the marker down. If it reaches 0, the game is lost.

**Completing Objectives:**
- Most require bringing a specific Item to a location (must be in inventory, no need to drop it).
- Some require dropping Items in a location. After completion, the Item can be picked up again.
- Flip Objective Card facedown when completed.

**Items:**
- **Flashlight (Cost: 2 Scrap, Unlimited Use):** Reduce Morale loss by 1 when losing Morale. No action required. Does not stack.
- **Motion Tracker (Cost: 2 Scrap, Unlimited Use):** Action: Reveal a Concealed Token up to 2 spaces away. If it’s the Alien, place it in the room and gain an action.
- **Grapple Gun (Cost: 3 Scrap, 2 Uses):** Action: If Alien is within 3 spaces, move it up to 3 spaces in any direction.
- **Incinerator (Cost: 4 Scrap, 2 Uses):** Action: If Alien is within 3 spaces, send it to the Nest. If used, skip the Encounter Phase.
- **Electric Prod (Cost: 3 Scrap, 2 Uses):** Reduce Morale loss from Alien encounter by 2. No action required.
- **Cat Carrier (Cost: 1 Scrap):** If you reveal Jonesy, capture it. No Morale loss.

**Coolant Canisters:**
- Can carry only 1 at a time.
- Can be discarded at the Workshop to gain 2 Scrap.
- Some objectives require them.

**Ash (Optional):**
- Moves toward nearest room with Scrap or crew. Crew decides in case of tie.
- If Ash reaches Scrap: Removes all Scrap from that space.
- If Ash reaches crew: Each crew member must discard 1 Scrap or lose 1 Morale.
- If a crew member stays with Ash, Ash cannot move and no Scrap/Morale loss occurs.
- **Final Mission "You Have My Sympathies":** Ash no longer moves toward Scrap or removes it. Does not cause Scrap/Morale loss.

**Final Mission:**
- Revealed when all starting Objectives are completed.
- Must meet all conditions simultaneously to win.
- Some Final Missions activate the Self-Destruct Track.

**Self-Destruct Track:**
- Placed when Final Mission requires it.
- 4 Countdown Tokens placed on it.
- At the start of the turn of the player who initiated it, remove 1 token.
- If cannot remove (no tokens left), ship is destroyed and game is lost.

# 6. Scoring & End Game

**Winning:**
- Complete all conditions of the Final Mission.

**Losing:**
- Crew Morale reaches 0.
- Self-Destruct Track loses all 4 tokens.
- (Director’s Cut variant) Self-Destruct is always used after all objectives.

# 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can you use multiple Flashlights?** No, effect does not stack. Only reduce Morale loss by 1.
- **Can you craft items anywhere?** Yes, unless playing Director’s Cut rules (only in Equipment Storage and Workshop).
- **What if you encounter the Alien during your move?** Lose 2 Morale, flee 3 spaces. Turn ends immediately.
- **Can you trade items during movement?** No, only when both crew are in the same room or corridor during Trade action.
- **What happens if the Alien moves into a crew member during Encounter Phase?** Same as above: lose Morale, flee, continue with Encounter Phase unless specified otherwise.
