## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Revolution*, players vie for control of a politically unstable city by influencing key characters to gain popular support. The two-player variant introduces a semi-autonomous "puppet" player (referred to as "Guy Fawkes") to simulate the competitive tension of a three- or four-player game. The objective remains to gain the most popular support by securing influence in seven city areas. The game ends when all influence spaces are filled. The player with the highest support wins. If Guy Fawkes wins the most support, the game is a shared loss for both human players.

2. Components  
- Base game board with 7 influence areas (Fortress, Harbour, Tavern, Duma, Market, Cathedral, Factory)  
- 12 character spaces: General, Captain, Innkeeper, Magistrate, Merchant, Priest, Union Boss, Printer, Spy, Apothecary, Mercenary, Rogue  
- Player sets: bid boards, bidding screens, influence cubes (2 colors), scoring markers  
- Tokens: Force (red), Blackmail (black), Gold (yellow)  
- Optional: Palace or Anarchy expansion components (not used in this variant)  
- Third "puppet" player components: bid board, influence cubes (e.g., fireworks or bombs), 1 Force, 1 Blackmail, 3 Gold  

3. Setup  
- Set up as a three-player game.  
- Each human player takes a full set (bid board, screen, cubes, scoring marker).  
- Place scoring markers on the "!" space of the support track.  
- Each player (including the puppet) starts with:  
  - 1 Force token  
  - 1 Blackmail token  
  - 3 Gold  
- The puppet player ("Guy Fawkes") has no screen but requires:  
  - A visible bid board  
  - A set of cubes in a third color (e.g., fireworks or bombs)  
- Bid Refunds variant is in effect: losing or tied bids are retained for next round.  
- Area Control variant is recommended OFF to preserve endgame tension.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of four phases:  
1. Espionage  
2. Bidding  
3. Scheming (new phase for two-player variant)  
4. Resolution  
5. Patronage  

Repeat until all influence spaces are filled.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Espionage: All players (including human) reveal their current tokens (Force, Blackmail, Gold) to each other.  
- Bidding: Players secretly assign all tokens to 1–6 characters using their bid boards and screens.  
  - Max 6 bids per player.  
  - Some characters restrict token types (e.g., Spy: no Force; Apothecary: no Blackmail).  
  - Gold may be allocated to "Scheming" (see below).  
- Scheming Phase (Between Bidding and Resolution):  
  - Players may set aside gold (not counted toward 6 bids) to influence the puppet player ("Guy").  
  - This gold is lost to the bank regardless of outcome.  
  - The player who spent more gold in Scheming acts first in influencing Guy’s bids.  
  - Tie in Scheming gold? Priority goes to player with:  
    1. Most powerful existing bid (Force > Blackmail > Gold)  
    2. If still tied, highest resolution-order bid  
  - First player places one or more of Guy’s tokens as a single bid on a character. Rules:  
    - Bid must be legal (respect token restrictions)  
    - Must equal or beat an existing bid (own or opponent’s)  
    - Bid is minimal: either ties or beats by one token  
    - Token used is lowest-value available (usually Gold)  
  - Second player then uses Guy’s remaining tokens to place one bid, following same rules  
  - Players alternate influencing Guy’s bids until:  
    - A player passes (on third or later bid)  
    - Guy has placed 6 bids  
    - Guy runs out of tokens  
  - Unused Guy tokens are lost to bank  
- Resolution:  
  - Resolve characters left to right, top to bottom (General → Mercenary)  
  - Highest bid wins. Force > Blackmail > Gold; higher count wins within type.  
  - Ties: no one wins the character.  
  - Winning bids: tokens go to supply.  
  - Losing or tied bids: tokens are retained (Bid Refunds variant).  
  - Character abilities resolved immediately:  
    - Gains support, influence, or tokens  
    - Spy: replace opponent’s cube with own  
    - Apothecary: swap any two cubes  
  - If Guy wins a bid on Spy or Apothecary:  
    - He abdicates decision to the player who influenced him last (i.e., the one who placed his final bid)  
    - Guy does not remove his own cubes, but may swap them  
- Patronage:  
  - All players (including Guy) collect Gold from bank up to 5 tokens total.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when all influence spaces are filled after a Resolution phase.  
- Final Patronage phase is skipped.  
- Add endgame token values:  
  - Force: 5 points each  
  - Blackmail: 3 points each  
  - Gold: 1 point each  
- Score each area: player with most influence cubes gains the support value (tied? no one scores)  
- If Guy Fawkes has the most total support, he wins — resulting in a loss for both human players.  
- Highest total support wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I use Scheming gold to influence Guy even if I don’t plan to win?  
  A: Yes. You can use it strategically to drain your opponent’s resources or manipulate Guy’s token usage.  
- Q: What happens if Guy ties a bid?  
  A: The character is negated — no one wins it.  
- Q: Can Guy fill an already-full influence area?  
  A: Yes, but he cannot place a cube. He still gains other rewards (support, tokens).  
- Q: Can I influence Guy to bid on a character I already control?  
  A: Yes. This can be used to force a tie or block others.  
- Q: What if both players spend 0 gold on Scheming?  
  A: Priority to influence Guy first goes to player with most powerful existing bid (Force > Blackmail > Gold), then by resolution order.  
- Q: Does Guy participate in Patronage?  
  A: Yes. He gains Gold up to 5 tokens if needed.  
- Q: Can Guy’s cubes be moved by Spy or Apothecary?  
  A: Yes, unless a player controls the Secret Police (from expansions, not used here).
