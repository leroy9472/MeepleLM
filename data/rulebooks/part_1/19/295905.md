## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Cosmic Frog is a game of strategic gluttony where players control immortal, two-mile-tall frogs (rayna) that harvest terrain from the Shards of Aeth, a shattered world. Players collect Land tiles (lowlands and highlands) from the Shard, store them temporarily in their Gullet, then transfer them to their Vault in the Aether. The game ends when the Shard is destroyed (Shard Integrity Track fills) or stripped of all Land tiles. The winner is the player (or team) with the highest-scoring Vault.

2. Components  
- 1 Neoprene game mat (Shard, Aether, Outer Dimensions, Shard Integrity Track)  
- 6 Player Boards (track Oomph and Gullet)  
- 6 Vault Boards (9 slots, 3 tiles deep)  
- 6 Frog miniatures with color bases  
- 36 Oomph crystals (max 6 per player)  
- 16 Ability Cards  
- 38 Action Cards (6 per color + Splinter Strike, Aether Flux)  
- 12 Splinter Location Cards  
- 6 Custom Dice (white 0–5, yellow 1–6, red 2–7)  
- 96 Barren Tiles (including 24 Fractures, 2 Quake, 2 Vortex)  
- 48 Lowland Tiles (3.5mm thick)  
- 60 Highland Tiles (5mm thick)  
- 6 Reference Cards

3. Setup  
- Determine number of frogs (3–6 players; teams possible).  
- Construct Shard:  
  - Place 84 Barren tiles on game mat hexes (randomize backs: blank, fracture, Quake, or Vortex).  
  - Place Lowland tiles face up on Barrens (one per hex).  
  - Place matching-domain Highlands on some Lowlands (e.g., forest on meadow).  
- Each player:  
  - Choose frog, color base, player board, vault board.  
  - Place 6 Oomph in “Available” area.  
  - Draw 2 Ability Cards, choose 1 to keep (face down), return other to bottom of deck.  
- Create decks:  
  - Action Deck: Shuffle appropriate number of color cards (based on player count) + Splinter Strike + Aether Flux. Start discard pile with these two event cards.  
  - Splinter Deck: Shuffle 12 Splinter Location Cards.  
- All frogs begin in Outer Dimensions.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Each round: Reveal Action Cards one at a time from the Action Deck.  
- If a color card is revealed, that frog takes a turn.  
- If Aether Flux or Splinter Strike is revealed, resolve the event immediately.  
- When Action Deck is empty, reshuffle discard pile to form a new deck.  
- Turn structure:  
  - If in Outer Dimensions at turn start: Roll die to return toward Dimension Zero.  
  - Regain 1 Ω per operational Siphon.  
  - Take one main action (based on location).  
  - Optionally take one extra action (costs 2 Ω, not allowed after RECOVER).  
  - Other players in Outer Dimensions may discard 2 set-aside action cards to return.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Oomph (Ω)**: Cosmic energy used to boost actions. Max 6. Regained via Siphons, RECOVER, or returning from Outer Dimensions.  
- **Gullet**: 4-slot temporary storage (bottom to top). Fills from bottom (slot 4), empties top-down. Full Gullet pushes bottom tile out (destroyed).  
- **Vault**: 9-slot permanent storage (3 tiles deep). Only Land tiles stored. Disgorge from Gullet to Vault.  
- **Siphon**: Vault stack of Low-High-Low in same Land Domain (stone, terra, water, plant). Grants 1 Ω per turn per domain (only one per domain active).  
- **Targeting**: On Shard, frogs target along straight lines (target lines) regardless of gaps. In Aether, only frogs/edges adjacent to Aether are targetable.  
- **Actions**:  
  - *On Shard*: ATTACK, HARVEST, LEAP, RECOVER, SLIPSTREAM.  
  - *In Aether*: ATTACK, DISGORGE, LAND, RECOVER, RAID.  
- **LEAP**: Move up to # of empty Gullet slots. Pay 1 Ω per extra hex. Can leap over gaps. Landing on frog triggers combat.  
- **SLIPSTREAM**: LEAP into Aether, then immediately LAND on any Aether-adjacent hex (costs 1 Ω).  
- **HARVEST**: Take top Land tile from current hex into Gullet.  
- **DISGORGE**: Move top Land tiles from Gullet to Vault (LIFO). Barrens destroyed.  
- **LAND**: Move from Aether to any Aether-adjacent Shard hex. Landing on frog triggers combat.  
- **RECOVER**: Regain all Expended Oomph. Must be only action this turn.  
- **ATTACK**: Initiated via LEAP or LAND onto opponent. Combat type depends on defender’s location.  
- **RAID**: Steal from a Vault of a player in Outer Dimensions.  
- **Extra Action**: Pay 2 Ω for second action (not allowed after RECOVER or if in Outer Dimensions).  
- **Combat**:  
  - Attacker declares attack. Defender revealed.  
  - Attacker and defender declare Overpower (2 Ω, roll 2 dice, take higher) and/or Boost (2 Ω per +1).  
  - Roll combat dice (based on ability card: white, yellow, red).  
  - Attacker must exceed defender’s roll.  
  - Success: Defender takes Knockback (X = Attacker – Defender). Attacker chooses:  
    - Steal X tiles from defender’s Gullet, or  
    - Free HARVEST (Shard) or RAID (Aether).  
  - Fail: Attacker moves to defender’s facing hex.  
- **Knockback**:  
  - *On Shard*: Fly X hexes back. Destroy top tile where you land. If land on frog on Land, destroy their tile and occupy facing hex. If land on frog on Barren, both go to Aether.  
  - *In Aether*: Knocked to Outer Dimension X. Lose all Ω, ability card to bottom of deck.  
- **Splinter Strike**:  
  - Draw Splinter Location Card. Strike hex: remove all tiles, frog there loses Gullet, Oomph, goes to Aether.  
  - Surrounding hexes: remove top tile, frogs go to Aether.  
  - If Barren has Fracture on back, place on Shard Integrity Track.  
- **Aether Flux (Mutate)**:  
  - All frogs choose:  
    - Randomly Mutate: Draw new ability (old to bottom).  
    - Resist: Pay 1 Ω to keep current.  
    - Selectively Mutate: Pay 2 Ω, draw one, choose to keep old or new.  
- **Quake & Vortex (variant)**:  
  - Quake: Remove Quake Barren → all on Shard go to Aether.  
  - Vortex: Remove Vortex Barren → all in Aether must descend.  
  - Resolve Quake before Vortex if both occur.  
- **Outer Dimensions**:  
  - Enter via Aether combat knockback.  
  - On your turn: Roll white die, return that many dimensions.  
  - If still in O.D. at turn end, set aside action card.  
  - Any time: Discard 2 set-aside cards to return immediately.  
  - If raided: Return 1 dimension per tile stolen.  
  - Return to Dimension Zero:  
    - Draw random ability, regain all Ω.  
    - Place in Aether or descend.  
    - If returned via die roll (not cards), may pay 2 Ω for extra action.  
    - Use all set-aside cards (one action each, no extra actions).  
- **Raiding**:  
  - Declare raid target (1 pt per Lowland, 2 pts per Highland).  
  - Target ≤ Outer Dimension level of victim.  
  - Roll raid die (white, unless ability says otherwise). Must exceed target.  
  - Steal exposed tiles; must empty one stack before switching.  
  - Victim returns 1 dimension per tile stolen.  
- **Ability Cards**:  
  - Passive or Activated (cost 1 Ω, use anytime, any turn).  
  - Face down: use white die for all rolls.  
  - Face up: use colored die as shown (white, yellow, red).  
  - Activated powers last only for current action.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when:  
  - Shard Integrity Track is full (6 Fractures), or  
  - Shard has no Land tiles left and current Action Deck runs out.  
- Scoring:  
  - **Placement Points**: Based on straight lines (row, column, diagonal) of exposed Lands of same type.  
    - Lowlands: 1 tile = 1 pt, 2 = 3 pts, 3 = 6 pts, 4 = 10 pts.  
    - Highlands: 1 = 2 pts, 2 = 5 pts, 3 = 9 pts, 4 = 14 pts.  
    - Score and remove lines until all tiles scored.  
  - **Diversity Points**: Based on number of Land Domains represented.  
    - 1 domain: 0 pts, 2: 2 pts, 3: 5 pts, 4: 9 pts.  
  - **Abundant/Harmonious Variant**:  
    - Abundant Land: +2 pts.  
    - Harmonious Land: +1 pt per other Land of same type in Vault.  
- Total = Placement + Diversity + Variant bonuses. Highest score wins (tie = shared victory).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can leap over gaps or between Shard islands.  
- Cannot attack frog in Aether from Shard.  
- Only one Siphon per Land Domain functions.  
- If Gullet full and gain tile, bottom tile is destroyed.  
- Vault is unlocked (raidable) if any team member is in Outer Dimensions (team play).  
- Cannot use RECOVER if any Ω spent or expended area empty.  
- Combat: Attacker wins by 0 or less → fail. Must exceed defender.  
- RAID: No penalty for failure. Cannot boost or overpower raid rolls.  
- Splinter Strike: Fracture Barrens go to Integrity Track immediately.  
- Aether Flux: All frogs in play must respond, even if ability unchanged.  
- Quake + Vortex: Resolve Quake first (all to Aether), then Vortex (all in Aether descend).  
- Returning from O.D.: Must use all set-aside cards, one at a time, no extra actions.
