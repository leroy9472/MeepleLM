## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Tides of Madness*, players take on the roles of investigators delving into forbidden knowledge of the Ancient Ones. Through contact with eldritch beings, cults, and lost manuscripts, they seek to gain powerful insights—but at great risk to their sanity.  

**Objective**: Score the most Victory Points (★) over three rounds without succumbing to madness. A player loses immediately if they have 9 or more Madness tokens (●) at the end of any round. If both players survive, the one with the most VP wins. In case of a tie, both share victory—and defeat.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Drafting Phase (per round)  
Repeat the following steps **5 times**, once per card in hand:  
1. **Choose**: Select one card from your hand and place it face down in front of you.  
2. **Reveal**: Simultaneously reveal all chosen cards with your opponent.  
3. **Pass**: Pass the remaining cards in your hand to your opponent.  

After 5 iterations, each player has 5 face-up cards in front of them and no cards in hand.

> **Note**: In Round 2, you begin with 1 kept card from Round 1 already in play. In Round 3, you begin with 2 kept cards from prior rounds.

#### Scoring Phase  
After all cards are revealed, follow these steps **in order**:  

1. **Gain Madness**: Take 1 Madness token (●) for each card you revealed that has the Madness icon (●).  
2. **Most Madness Bonus**:  
   - The player who gained **more** Madness this round may choose:  
     - Gain **4 VP**, OR  
     - **Heal 1 Madness token** (remove and return to supply).  
   - If tied in Madness gained, **no player** receives this choice.  
3. **Score Objectives**: Evaluate each revealed card’s ability. Record VP earned on notepad.  
4. **Madness Check**:  
   - If a player has **9 or more Madness tokens**, they **lose immediately**.  
   - If **both players** have 9+ Madness, the game ends with **no winner**.

> Scoring is cumulative across rounds. Track total VP and total accumulated Madness throughout.

#### Refresh Phase (Rounds 1 → 2 only)  
After scoring Round 1 and Round 2 (but **not** after Round 3):  
1. Take the 5 cards you played this round back into your hand.  
2. Choose **1 card** from your hand to **keep** for the rest of the game. Place it face down in front of you (this becomes a permanent "in play" card).  
3. Simultaneously with opponent, **discard 1 card** from your hand face up to the game box.  
4. **Reveal** your kept card (now visible and active in future rounds).  
5. **Draw 2 new cards** from the draw pile.  

After this phase, each player should have **5 cards in hand**.

> - After Round 1 refresh: You have **1 kept card** in play, 5 in hand.  
> - After Round 2 refresh: You have **2 kept cards** in play, 5 in hand.  
> - Round 3: No refresh. You draft using 5 cards in hand and score **7 cards total** (2 kept + 5 drafted).

  - Highest VP wins.  
  - In case of a tie, **both players share victory (and defeat)**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: What happens to discarded cards during Refresh?**  
A: Discarded cards go face up to the game box and are **out of the game**. They cannot be drawn or reused.

**Q: Can I choose to heal Madness even if I’m not close to 9?**  
A: Yes. You may choose to heal 1 Madness instead of gaining 4 VP, regardless of current count.

**Q: How many cards are drawn in total?**  
A:  
- Start: 5 dealt  
- Round 1 → 2: +2 drawn  
- Round 2 → 3: +2 drawn  
Total unique cards seen: 9 per player (5 initial + 4 drawn). However, due to passing and drafting, players interact with more than just their own cards.

**Q: How does card order affect Shub-Niggurath?**  
A: When scoring, place Shub-Niggurath **on top of** the card it modifies. It doubles the VP of the **immediately previous** card you played **in that round**. If it's your first played card, it has no effect.

**Q: How does Dreamlands work?**  
A: Dreamlands has a **wild suit**. Before scoring each round, declare which suit (Races, Locations, etc.) it represents. It counts toward majorities in that suit.  
Additionally, **after** step 2 of scoring (Most Madness check), take **1 Madness token from your opponent** and add it to your own. This increases your Madness total and may affect future checks.

**Q: What does “majority” mean?**  
A: Having **more cards** in a suit than your opponent. Ties do not count as a majority.

**Q: How does Miskatonic University work?**  
A: For **each suit** in which you have a majority, gain **4 VP**. This is **added** to other scoring effects (e.g., cards that reward majority in a specific suit).

**Q: Are kept cards used in drafting?**  
A: No. Kept cards are **not in hand** and are **not passed**. They are only used during **scoring** as part of your played set.
