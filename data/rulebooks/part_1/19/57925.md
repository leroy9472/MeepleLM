## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The revolution in Cuba has ended, and players take on the role of builders reconstructing Havana by constructing buildings to earn victory points (VP). The goal is to be the first to reach the required VP threshold—25 VP (2 players), 20 VP (3 players), or 15 VP (4 players)—triggering an immediate end to the game.

### 3. Setup  
- **Table Setup**:  
  - Place 12 building cards face-up in two rows of 6.  
    - At least one end building (left or right of either row) must have a cost of 1, 2, or 3.  
  - Place 4 Pesos and 3 randomly drawn cubes from the bag in the center.  
  - Place remaining buildings in a face-down draw pile.  
  - Place Pesos, workers, and bag within reach as shared supply.  

- **Player Setup**:  
  - Each player receives:  
    - 13 action cards (identical set for all)  
    - 1 random cube (drawn from bag)  
    - 1 Peso  
  - Each places two player aid cards in front of them.

- **Phase 0 – Initial Turn Order**:  
  - All players simultaneously choose two action cards and place them face-down.  
  - Reveal and arrange cards with lower number on the left to form a two-digit number (e.g., 0 and 7 → 07).  
  - Turn order is determined by ascending numerical value of this number.  
    - **Tiebreakers**: Fewest VP → fewest colored cubes → fewest Pesos → fewest workers → fewest gray cubes → younger player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has three phases:

#### **Phase 1: Perform Two Actions and Purchase Buildings**  
- Players take turns in order of their two-digit card number (lowest first).  
- **Actions**:  
  - Perform both actions in any order.  
  - Actions are mandatory unless card specifies otherwise (e.g., Refreshment, Conservation).  
  - Action effects (from card text):  
    - **0 Siesta**: No action. Useful for low turn order.  
    - **1 Refreshment**: Optional action—take 1 Peso from center.  
    - **2 Protection**: Optional—protect resources from thieves/tax collectors this round.  
    - **2 Debris**: Take all gray cubes from center.  
    - **3 Conservation**: Optional—remove one end building from a row and return it to box. Only one building may be removed this way per round by any player.  
    - **3 Tax Collector**: Take 1 Peso from supply; remove 1 worker or 1 material (any color) from each player who acts *after* you.  
    - **4 Worker**: Take 2 workers from supply (only if you are first to play this action in the round).  
    - **4 Architect**: Take 1 worker from supply. Must have this card active to build buildings requiring a master builder.  
    - **5 Pesos Thief**: Steal half (rounded down) of Pesos from one player who acts after you. If no one after, steal from any player.  
    - **6 Materials Thief**: Steal 1 material from a following player; if they have >3 colored cubes, steal 2.  
    - **7 Black Market**: Take 2 cubes from bag (only if first to play this action).  
    - **8 Pesos**: Take half (rounded up) of Pesos from center.  
    - **9 Mama**: Take half (rounded up) of each type (colored and gray) from center.  

- **Purchasing Buildings**:  
  - After actions, may buy any number of buildings.  
  - Only end buildings (far left or far right of either row) are available (always 4 choices).  
  - Pay exact cost shown (materials and/or workers and/or Pesos).  
    - **5-to-1 Swaps**:  
      - 5 Pesos = 1 worker  
      - 5 gray cubes = 1 colored cube (any color)  
    - Spent cubes are **removed from the game**.  
    - Spent workers and Pesos return to supply.  
    - Architect card remains in play (not spent).  
  - Purchased buildings are placed face-up in front of player (VP secured).

- **Refill Buildings**:  
  - If any row has only 2 buildings left, immediately draw 4 from the deck and place them face-up **between** the two remaining cards (restoring a 6-card row).

#### **Phase 2: Resupply**  
- Add 3 random cubes (from bag) to the center.  
- Add 3 Pesos to the center.  
- Leftover resources remain in center (accumulate).

#### **Phase 3: New Action Card**  
- In same order as Phase 1, each player selects one card from hand and places it face-down on top of one of their two current action cards.  
- After all players have placed, reveal the new cards.  
- Discard the covered (old) card to player’s discard pile.  
- Reorder the two revealed cards with lower number on left (to form smallest two-digit number).  
- **Refill Hand**: If a player now has **2 or fewer cards in hand**, they take all discarded cards back into hand (now has 11 cards again).

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Turn Order**: Based on two-digit number formed by two active action cards.  
- **Action Card Cycling**: Each turn, one card is replaced. Hand size decreases until player has ≤2 cards, then full reset.  
- **Resource Management**: Collect cubes, Pesos, and workers to build buildings.  
- **Strategic Timing**: Early play allows better access to buildings and first access to actions like Worker and Black Market.  
- **Player Interaction**: Thieves and tax collectors target opponents, especially those later in turn order.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Victory points are earned immediately upon purchasing a building.  
- Game ends **immediately** when any player reaches:  
  - **25 VP** in 2-player game  
  - **20 VP** in 3-player game  
  - **15 VP** in 4-player game  
- The round does **not** finish. That player wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip actions?** Only if the card says so (Refreshment, Conservation). All others are mandatory.  
- **What if no workers are available for Worker or Architect?** Player cannot take action if no workers in supply.  
- **Can multiple Conservation cards remove multiple buildings?** No. Only one building may be removed per round via Conservation.  
- **Can I use 5 gray cubes for a colored material even if I don’t have that color?** Yes. 5 gray cubes = 1 colored cube of **any** color.  
- **Can I swap 5 Pesos for a worker during building purchase?** Yes, counts as paying a worker.  
- **Can I buy buildings in any order?** Yes, as long as they are currently on an end.  
- **What if a player runs out of action cards?** Hand is refilled only when ≤2 cards remain in hand (after Phase 3).  
- **Do thieves affect players who already played?** No. Tax Collector and thief cards only affect players who act **after** the current player.
