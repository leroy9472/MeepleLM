## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Masters of Renaissance*, players are influential citizens of Florence striving to increase their fame and prestige during the Renaissance. By acquiring resources, purchasing development cards, and leveraging leaders’ abilities, players build engines to generate wealth and influence. Devotion to the Pope through Faith Points also plays a crucial role. The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VPs) by the end of the game.

### 3. Setup  

#### General Setup  
1. Place the **Resource Supply** on the table. Divide all resources into their respective slots. Place the "3x" tiles nearby.  
2. Sort **Development Cards** by type and level. Shuffle each of the 12 stacks (4 types × 3 levels) separately.  
3. Arrange the cards face-up in a 4-column grid:  
   - Columns = card types (green, yellow, blue, purple)  
   - Rows = levels (Level I at bottom, Level III at top)  
4. Place the **Market Board** and insert the **Market Tray**.  
5. Randomly place **12 Market Marbles** on the tray (3 rows × 4 columns). Place the remaining marble on the top-right corner slide.  
6. Shuffle **Leader Cards** into a face-down deck.  
7. Return **Solo Action Tokens** and **Black Cross Token** to the box (solo mode only).  

#### Player Setup  
Each player takes:  
- 1 **Personal Board**  
- 3 **Pope's Favor Tiles**, placed on the Faith Track showing the "non-active" side (red X)  
- 1 **Faith Marker** on space “0” of the Faith Track  
- Draws 4 **Leader Cards**, chooses 2 to keep (in hand, hidden), discards the rest  
- All other Leader Cards go back in the box  

#### Starting Player  
- Choose a first player randomly. That player receives the **Inkwell**.  

#### Initial Resources & Faith  
In turn order (clockwise), each player (except first) selects:  
- Any number and type of **Resources** to take  
- Place them in **Warehouse depots** (following depot rules)  
- Gain **Faith Points** equal to the number of Resources taken  
  - Move Faith Marker forward accordingly on the Faith Track  

> Note: The first player takes no initial resources or Faith Points.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise, starting with the first player. On your turn, you **must** perform **one** of the following actions:  
1. **Take Resources from the Market**  
2. **Buy one Development Card**  
3. **Activate the Production**  

Additionally, you may perform **one or both** of the following **Leader Actions** during your turn:  
- **Discard a Leader Card** → gain 1 Faith Point  
- **Play a Leader Card** (if requirements met) → gain permanent ability  

You may perform your main action and both leader actions in any order, including doing multiple leader actions.

After your turn, if playing solo, reveal the top **Solo Action Token** and resolve it.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Taking Resources from the Market  
- Choose **one row or one column** of marbles in the Market Tray.  
- Collect the resources shown on each marble in that line.  
  - Marble Colors → Resources:  
    - Grey = Stone  
    - Yellow = Coin  
    - White = Servant  
    - Red = Shield  
    - Blue = Faith Point  
    - Purple = (see Leader ability)  
- The single marble on the slide is **not** part of the grid and is used to push marbles.  
- After collecting:  
  - Take the marble from the **slide** and insert it into the **end of your chosen row/column**, following arrow directions.  
  - This pushes the opposite marble **off** the tray and onto the slide.  

> Example: Choosing a row with grey, yellow, yellow, white → take 1 stone, 2 coins, 1 servant. Insert blue slide marble → white marble moves to slide.

- **Faith Points**: When receiving a blue marble, move your Faith Marker forward 1 space.

#### Depots Rules (Warehouse)  
- Your **Warehouse** has 3 depots: sizes 1, 2, and 3 slots.  
- Rules:  
  - Only **one type** of resource per depot  
  - No two depots may hold the same resource  
  - You may rearrange resources freely during your turn (as long as rules are followed)  
- If you cannot store all resources taken:  
  - Discard unplaceable resources  
  - **All other players gain 1 Faith Point per discarded resource**  

> Note: Faith Points are recorded on the Faith Track, not stored in depots.

#### Buying a Development Card  
- Buy **one** face-up card from the grid.  
- Pay the **cost** shown on the card using resources from:  
  - Warehouse depots  
  - Strongbox  
- Return paid resources to the **Resource Supply**.  
- Place the card in one of the 3 slots on your Personal Board:  
  - **Level I**: Can go in any empty slot  
  - **Level II**: Must be placed **over** a Level I card (any color)  
  - **Level III**: Must be placed **over** a Level II card (any color)  
- Cards are stacked slightly staggered to show underlying cards.  

> Important: When the last card of a deck (type + level) is bought, **do not refill** — that card becomes unavailable.

#### Activating the Production  
- Activate **any or all** visible production powers on your board:  
  - Development Cards (central “open book” icon)  
  - Basic production power (scroll slot on left of board): pay 2 resources (any type) → receive 1 resource of your choice  
- To activate:  
  - Pay input resources (from **Warehouse** or **Strongbox**)  
  - Receive output resources → place in **Strongbox**  
  - Faith Points earned → move Faith Marker  
- Rules:  
  - All production powers are resolved **simultaneously**  
  - Cannot use output from one power to pay for another  
  - Must have all input resources **before** activation  
  - You may skip activating any power  
- **Strongbox**:  
  - No limits on number or type of resources  
  - Can store mixed types together  
  - **No direct transfer** between Warehouse and Strongbox  
  - Only way to add to Strongbox: via **Production action**

> 3x Tiles: If you have 3 of the same resource in your Strongbox, replace them with a "3x" tile and 1 resource on top. Return 2 to supply. You can combine multiple tiles (e.g., 6 stones → 2 tiles).

#### The Vatican Report  
- The Faith Track has **3 Vatican Report sections**, each ending in a **Pope space**.  
- When **any player’s Faith Marker reaches or passes a Pope space**, a **Vatican Report** occurs:  
  - All players check their Faith Marker position  
  - If on or beyond the **active section** (the one just triggered), flip the corresponding **Pope's Favor tile** face-up (active)  
  - If before the section, **discard** that tile  
- Each Vatican Report triggers **only once** in the game  
- At game end, only **face-up** Pope's Favor tiles count for VP

#### Leader Actions  
- **Discard a Leader Card** → gain 1 Faith Point (no requirement)  
- **Play a Leader Card** → if requirements met:  
  - Requirements: specific number of cards (by type/level) or resources in supply  
  - Count **all** development cards (including covered ones)  
  - No cost — just meet condition  
  - Place card face-up next to board; ability is active for rest of game  

##### Leader Special Abilities  
Four types:  
1. **Discount when buying cards**:  
   - Pay 1 less of the indicated resource when buying a card that costs it  
2. **Extra 2-slot depot**:  
   - Can store specified resource type  
   - May also store same type in regular warehouse depot  
3. **White Marble conversion**:  
   - Each white marble in selected row/column gives the indicated resource  
   - If two such leaders: choose **one** resource per white marble (not both)  
4. **Additional production power**:  
   - During production, use this power: pay nothing → receive 1 resource of your choice + 1 Faith Point

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Trigger  
Game ends immediately when **either** condition is met:  
- A player buys their **7th Development Card**  
- A player reaches the **last space** of their Faith Track (triggers final Vatican Report)  

Then:  
- All other players take **one final turn**, proceeding clockwise from the current player, until the player **to the right of the first player** (holder of Inkwell) has played.  
- Game ends; scoring begins.

#### Victory Points (VPs)  
Score from:  
- **Development Cards**: Each card on your board (visible or covered) gives its listed VP  
- **Faith Track**: VP based on final space of Faith Marker (shown on track)  
- **Pope's Favor Tiles**: Each **face-up** tile gives its listed VP  
- **Played Leader Cards**: Each face-up Leader Card gives its listed VP  
- **Resources**: 1 VP per **set of 5** resources in total supply  
  - Count all resources in: Warehouse, Strongbox, Leader special depots  
  - Total ÷ 5 → round down  

> Example: 12 resources → 2 VP

#### Winning  
- Highest total VP wins  
- Tiebreaker: Most total resources in supply (Warehouse + Strongbox + special depots)  
- If still tied: shared victory (rules imply single winner, so assume further tiebreaks not defined)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I rearrange depots during production?**  
  Yes, anytime during your turn, as long as depot rules are followed.  

- **Can I activate production without paying for any power?**  
  Yes, but you gain nothing. Still counts as performing the action.  

- **Do I have to use all production powers?**  
  No. You may skip any.  

- **Can I play a leader card and discard another in the same turn?**  
  Yes. Both leader actions are optional and can be combined.  

- **What happens if Resource Supply runs out during production?**  
  Use "3x" tiles to consolidate Strongbox; return extras to supply. If still short, game assumes supply is sufficient (no explicit rule, but design implies enough resources).  

- **Can I use resources from Strongbox to buy cards?**  
  Yes. Both Warehouse and Strongbox resources can be used.  

- **Are covered cards counted for leader requirements?**  
  Yes. All development cards (including buried ones) count toward leader conditions.  

- **Can I trigger a Vatican Report with the Black Cross (solo)?**  
  Yes. In solo mode, if the Black Cross reaches a Pope space, a Vatican Report occurs normally.  

- **Can I have two different 2-slot special depots?**  
  Yes, if you play two leaders with this ability (for same or different resources).
