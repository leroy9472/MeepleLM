## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The game simulates the struggle for survival of early hominid species in prehistoric Europe amid environmental shifts and cultural evolution. Players represent Neanderthal tribes competing through adaptation, hunting, social structures, and cultural development. The objective is to achieve victory based on one’s chosen sexuality-based strategy—Promiscuous, Pair Bonding, or Harem—by accumulating tribesmen, daughters, elders, inventions, animals, and trophies.

Victory is determined at game end by scoring criteria on the sexuality card. Additional victory conditions exist in solo variants.

2. Components  
- Event/Daughter Deck: 10 (or 8 in solo) cards shuffled face down.  
- Biome Decks: North and South Europe decks, shuffled separately.  
- Europe Biomes: 6 cards from each deck revealed in two rows.  
- Player Placards: One per player, starting with Vocal side up.  
- Tribesmen: 18 per player (cubes), including 1 Alpha.  
- Vocabulary Disks: 5 white (nature), 5 orange (social), 5 black (technical) per player.  
- Sexuality Cards: Randomly assigned; indicate MPI (Male Parental Involvement) requirements.  
- Deadpile: Shared pool for discarded tribesmen.  

3. Setup  
- Shuffle 10 daughter cards to form the Event deck (8 in solo).  
- Shuffle North and South biome decks; reveal top 6 cards each in two rows to the right of their decks.  
- Randomly assign each player a placard (Vocal side up).  
- Give each player 5 disks of each color (white, orange, black).  
- Randomly assign a sexuality card; player chooses starting side and places indicated MPI disks on it.  
- Place 6 unassigned tribesmen under the placard.  
- Place 1 tribesman as an immature Fire Starter Elder (rank 6) on the placard with a black disk beneath.  
- Place 1 vocabulary disk on the downward-arrow portal spot in the brain.  
- Remaining tribesmen and Alpha go to the deadpile.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of six phases:

Phase 1: Events  
- Reveal top Event/Daughter card.  
- Apply event icons from top to bottom, left to right:  
  - Global Cooling: Replace lowest-climax North biome with face-down card (ice sheet); remove corresponding South card.  
  - Global Warming: Replace lowest-climax South biome with face-up card; flip all ice sheets in South row.  
  - Elder Death: Roll die per icon; remove matching elders.  
  - Blizzard: Dependents (unmarried/immature-husbanded daughters, elders, animals) require 2 unassigned tribesmen or die.  
  - Chaos: If tribesmen > vocabulary, lose 1 elder and half unassigned tribesmen (rounded up). Fire Starter prevents elder loss and rounds down; Chief prevents Chaos entirely. If losses occur, player may flip sexuality.  
  - Wanderlust: Player losing most tribesmen in Chaos sends 1 deadpile tribesman per icon to another player (chaperone required).  
  - Würm Glacial: Add a random daughter card to bottom of Event deck.  
- Cultural Auction (Vocal and Tribal Harem players only):  
  - Bid hidden discs matching colors shown on daughter card.  
  - Minimum bid: 1 disc. Harem bidders count discs as half value.  
  - Winner takes daughter, places bid discs on card (daughter is immature). Ties broken by player order.  

Phase 2: Hunter Assignment  
In player order:  
- Assign unassigned tribesmen to:  
  a) Biomes (hunting): Must meet precondition tool colors (available disks).  
  b) Elder slots: Place 1 tribesman + required color disk underneath (immature). Vocal players placing rank 3/4/5 elders must have all three portal colors in elder’s domain.  
  c) Daughter cards (courtship): 1 suitor per daughter. Auto-success if uncontested and unmarried in own tableau.  
- Exceptions:  
  - Almost Extinct: If no unassigned tribesmen, reassign up to 2 elders/husbands. If all tribesmen dead, become Lazarus Species.  
  - Sultan’s Exception (Harem): Shift husbands among unmarried mature daughters.  

Phase 3: Negotiations, Attack Rolls, Gathering  
- Negotiations (Tribal only, with mature Chief): Propose peaceful withdrawal, card exchange, daughter marriage, or future agreements. Vocal players respond only “Ook!” or “Ook ook.”  
- Leaving: Tribesmen leave only with consent of all present players. Husbands may leave wives (become unassigned).  
- Attack Rolls: If opposing players share a location, attack in order of most black disks (Most Flint Order).  
  - Roll 1 die per hunter. Each 1 kills 1 enemy (victim chooses target).  
  - War Parties (Alpha + Warrior Elder, or mature weapon invention): Hit on 1 or 2.  
  - Jealous Husband: Mature husband defending wife attacks as war party.  
- Gathering: Promiscuous players or those with gathering ability gain 1 baby per occupied gathering biome.  

Phase 4: Hunting Rolls (Least Hunter Order)  
- Order: Uncontested non-predators → Contested non-predators → Predators (1st player chooses order within contested/predator).  
- Roll 1 die per hunter (Alpha may auto-roll 1 if powered by Knapper, Warrior, or Trapper).  
- Success: Hits ≥ required on card ( = 1, = 1 or 2).  
- Death: Frostbite ( ) or Bloody ( ) result kills hunter even if hunt succeeds.  
- Trophy: Roll n-of-a-kind as shown → claim card as trophy (antlers up). Not replaced.  
- Invention/Animal: Roll n-of-a-kind + have elder → take card into hand (replaced). Must have survivors.  
- Predator Attraction: After big game success, attract closest predator (2 if equidistant). Surviving hunters move and roll again. If no hit, predator steals all rewards.  
- Winner Takes All: First successful hunter gains rewards; others return home.  

Phase 5: Domestic Animals  
- If player has mature domestic animal, collect babies and free disks as indicated.  

Phase 6: Portal, Neolexia & Elder Actions (Choose One)  
- Portal (Vocal only): Use daughter’s color to place matching disk on her portal spot. Max 2 disks per portal (1 per color). At 5 (6 in 2-player), flip to Tribal.  
- Neolexia (Vocal only): Free 1 disk from immature item matching a portal color. Marriage to foreign daughter grants access to her father’s portal colors (if Tribal, all 3 colors).  
- Elder Action (Tribal only): Play D (animal) or I (invention) card from hand to tableau using appropriate elder.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Disks: Represent vocabulary (white: nature, orange: social, black: technical). Used for preconditions, maturity, portals.  
- Maturity: Items (elders, daughters, husbands, inventions, animals) with disks are immature. Free all disks to mature.  
- MPI: Disks on sexuality card; cannot be used until sexuality flipped.  
- Portals: Brain spots (Venus, Shaman, Bison) accept specific color disks. Used for elder prerequisites and Tribal conversion.  
- Vocal → Tribal: Flip placard when 5 (6 in 2-player) portal disks placed. Frees disks, transfers elders.  
- Alpha: Regular tribesman unless empowered by elder. Can be swapped with unassigned tribesman if in deadpile or permanently assigned.  
- War Party: Alpha + Warrior Elder, or any hunter with mature weapon invention. Hits on 1–2 during attacks.  
- Courtship Rolls (Vocabulary Order):  
  - Roll 1d6 per suitor. 1 or 2 = success. 6 = suitor dies.  
  - Auto-success: Warrior Alpha, uncontested own daughter, negotiated marriage.  
  - Immature daughter: Courtship fails.  
  - Promiscuous suitor: Cannot marry; instead place wanderluster from deadpile.  
  - Husband maturity: Foreign husband = mature; own tableau = immature (orange disk).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when:  
  - Last Event card is played.  
  - Europe is fully ice-covered (no huntable biomes).  
- Scoring (per Sexuality Card):  
  - Tribesmen: All of player’s color (including in others’ camps).  
  - Alpha: Only if empowered (by rank 3/4/5 elder).  
  - Daughters, Elders, Husbands, Animals, Inventions: Only if mature.  
- Victory Types:  
  - Selfish Gene (Promiscuous)  
  - Family Values (Pair Bonding)  
  - Big Man (Harem)  
- Ties: Shared victory.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I use the same portal disk for multiple elders?  
  A: No. Each elder placement requires fresh portal disks in their domain.  
- Q: What happens if a biome is replaced during Global Cooling/Warming?  
  A: Tribesmen move to the new card. Ice sheets block predator movement.  
- Q: Can I bid zero in the Cultural Auction?  
  A: No. Minimum bid is 1 disc.  
- Q: Do dead hunters count toward hand limit?  
  A: No. Hand limit = number of mature elders.  
- Q: Can I take a card into hand if all hunters die?  
  A: No. Must have survivors to claim invention/animal cards.  
- Q: Can I change sexuality without Chaos losses?  
  A: No. Only allowed if losses occurred during Chaos.
