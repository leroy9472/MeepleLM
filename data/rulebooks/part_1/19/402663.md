# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In *Salton Sea*, players manage geothermal lithium extraction corporations in California’s Imperial Valley, leveraging geothermal heat and brine to extract lithium and generate energy. The goal is to maximize victory points (VP) through efficient resource extraction, processing, commercialization, and strategic development.

The game ends when either:
- The claim card deck is empty, or
- Two corporations have closed (their financial asset indicators reach the final space)

## 3. Setup

### Player Setup
Each player:
- Chooses a color and takes corresponding components
- Places:
  - Business development indicator on first space of track
  - 1 engineer on each of the three spaces of the business development track
  - Warehouse tiles face down, in ascending order, on right side of board
  - Brine token at "1", lithium and geothermal energy tokens at "0" in warehouse
  - Drill and extraction plant damage indicators at farthest left of their tracks
  - 4 engineers in HR space
  - Starting claim tile in designated slot, drill token on top
- Draws 7 starting $1 action cards (1 from each $1 deck)

### Game Board Setup
- Place game board in center
- Each player places score counter at "0" on score track
- Each player places one share token at bottom of each corporation’s shares track
- Place financial asset value indicators on tracks per player count
- **Profit-Sharing Tiles**:
  - Top space: 1 random tile per corporation
  - Center: stack of (players – 1) tiles per corp
  - Bottom: stack of (players) tiles per corp
- **Fee Tiles**:
  - 3 startup fee tiles (with closed corp icon) placed randomly in current investment spaces, revealed
  - 2 random non-startup fee tiles placed face down in future investment spaces per corp
- **Claim Cards**:
  - Separate into superficial and deep decks
  - Remove 1/2/3 cards per deck for 4/3/2 players
  - Stack superficial on deep, shuffle into one deck
  - Reveal top 4, place face up from top to bottom on board
- **Objective Cards**: Shuffle, reveal 5, discard rest
- **Card Markets**:
  - Shuffle research, contract (retail on top of large), and action cards ($5, $3, $1 decks)
  - Reveal market cards: 4/5/6 per deck for 2/3/4 players
- Determine starting player

## 4. Gameplay Flow
A round consists of player turns followed by an End of Round Phase.

### Turn Sequence
On your turn:
1. Place one engineer on:
   - An available action space on your player board
   - A Prompt action on a card in your hand
   - An immediate effect research card
   - A contract card on your board
2. Resolve the corresponding action
3. That space is blocked until end of round
4. Next player takes turn clockwise

Round ends when all players have used all engineers.

### End of Round Phase
**Player Actions**:
- Return used engineers to HR
- Remove and set aside executed contracts
- Remove and set aside used immediate research cards; slide others left
- Return played action cards to hand

**Board Actions**:
- Rotate first player marker clockwise
- Remove bottom claim card; move others down; refill top from deck
- Discard rightmost face-up card in each market row; refill from deck

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Industrial Actions
- **Acquire a Drilling License**:
  - Pay cost (card cost + space surcharge)
  - Add claim card below existing claims
  - Slide down existing claims if needed
  - Refill claim row

- **Drill**:
  - Lower drill one layer
  - If layer has rocks, advance drill damage indicator by number of rock icons
  - If damage reaches final spaces, drill freezes until repaired
  - Some actions allow drilling multiple layers or ignoring damage

- **Extract**:
  - Must have drill at or below brine layer
  - Extract up to action limit (1–5 depending on card/research)
  - Cover brine icons with exhausted tokens (top to bottom)
  - Move brine token right in warehouse
  - When claim is fully exhausted: gain bonus, flip card

- **Process**:
  - Must have operational extraction plant (no full damage)
  - Spend brine and money:
    - 1 brine + $6 → 1 lithium
    - 1 brine + $4 → 1 geothermal energy
  - After any Process action: optional bonus production:
    - +1 lithium → +3 plant damage
    - +1 geothermal → +2 plant damage

- **Repair Machinery**:
  - Pay $3 per damage point repaired
  - Can repair drill, plant, or both
  - Some cards/tiles give discounts

### Commercial Actions
- **Sell**:
  - Sell up to limit (1–3) to one corporation
  - Prices set by current fee tile
  - Collect money equal to sale value from market
  - Move buyer’s financial asset indicator up 1
  - If indicator passes “change fees” icon: replace fee tile
  - If indicator reaches end: corporation closes (game end trigger)

- **Enter into a Contract**:
  - Take one face-up contract card, place in empty slot on board
  - Occupies space until executed

- **Execute a Contract**:
  - Spend required resources
  - Gain benefits: money, VP, shares, development advancement, claim card

### Management Actions
- **Research**:
  - Buy one face-up research card
  - Pay cost (if any)
  - Place in leftmost empty slot at top of warehouse
  - **Immediate Effect**: use once, then discard
  - **Permanent Effect**: stays, grants ongoing ability and endgame VP (VP × position)

- **Buy Shares**:
  - Buy up to limit (1–2) from one corporation
  - Pay current price per share
  - Cannot buy above financial asset indicator
  - Move share token up; gain rewards on track (including profit-sharing tiles)

- **Develop a Business Project**:
  - Pay $3
  - Move development indicator forward 1 space
  - Unlock: warehouse space (flip tile), engineers (add to HR), VP (endgame)
  - Reaching end grants 2 VP per future advancement

- **Obtain Financing**:
  - Draw one $1 action card from deck
  - No cost, no limit per round

- **Repeat an Action**:
  - Pay $1
  - Repeat any action already performed this round (except Obtain Financing)
  - Cannot repeat a repeated action

## 6. Scoring & End Game

### End Game Triggers (checked during End of Round Phase):
- Claim card deck is empty, OR
- Two corporations have closed (financial asset indicators at end)

### Final Scoring
**Victory Points from**:
- Exhausted claim cards (bonus on flipped side)
- Executed contracts (VP on card)
- Short-term objectives (first to complete, immediate VP)
- Long-term objectives (checked at game end)
- Grey Stars:
  - Unlock via business development track
  - Score 1 VP per Grey Star on completed objectives
- Research cards (permanent):
  - VP shown × position on board
- Shares:
  - Number of shares × current financial asset value
- Warehouse contents:
  - 1 VP per brine
  - 3 VP per geothermal energy
  - 5 VP per lithium
- Hand of action cards:
  - 2 VP per $3 value (e.g., $3 card = 2 VP, $6 = 4 VP)

**VP Loss**:
- Unfulfilled contracts: lose half VP value (rounded down)
- Drill damage: lose VP based on position (per track)
- Plant damage: lose VP based on position (per track)

**Tiebreaker**:
- Most total value in action cards in hand

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Market Liquidity**: If market cannot pay full sale amount, player receives as much as possible.
- **No Change**: When paying, discard cards totaling at least cost. Excess is lost.
- **Engineer Limits**: Engineers gained via development are added to HR at end of round.
- **Contract Execution**: Can only execute contracts on your board. Market contracts must first be acquired.
- **GMI (Solo Mode)**:
  - Uses cards instead of engineers
  - Resolves topmost possible action per card
  - Does **not** perform: Obtain Financing, Repeat an Action, Enter into Contract
  - Prioritizes actions (e.g., sells lithium over energy if tied)
  - Gains shares from research automatically if eligible
- **Profit-Sharing Tiles**: One per turn, resolved before or after main action
- **Card Limits**: No hand limit for action cards
- **Bonus Tiles**: Acquired via share track or research, used immediately or saved
