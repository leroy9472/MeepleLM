## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 1878, the Royal Museum of Berlin funds excavations at Pergamon, an ancient city in modern-day Turkey. Players take on the role of archaeologists uncovering artifacts—vases, jugs, bracelets, and golden masks—dating from the 1st to 5th century AC. The goal is to gain the most recognition (victory points) by exhibiting valuable collections at the Pergamon Museum. Victory points are earned through admission tickets awarded during evaluations and for having the oldest exhibited artifacts.

The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins. In case of a tie, the player whose exhibited collection contains the oldest single find wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board (featuring excavation site, calendar, research funds track, and museum exhibition plan)  
- 4 player figures (in 4 colors)  
- 12 circular markers (4 sets of I, II, III)  
- 12 angular markers (4 sets of I, II, III) — one set per player  
- 60 square find tiles (depicting artifacts with century and year)  
- 24 research funds cards (3 copies each of values 1–8 coins)  
- 40 coins (currency)  
- 36 admission tickets (victory points: 12 × 1 VP, 12 × 2 VP, 12 × 5 VP)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Shuffle the 24 research funds cards and place them face-down as a draw pile.  
3. Divide the 60 find tiles into 12 stacks of 5 tiles each. Place each stack face-down on the corresponding space of the 12-turn calendar.  
4. Place coins and admission tickets in supply beside the board.  
5. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
   - 1 player figure  
   - 3 circular markers  
   - 3 angular markers  
   - 1 reminder card  
6. The oldest player becomes the first player.  
7. The tomb raider is only used in 2-player games or solo variants.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 12 turns. Each turn has four phases:

#### Phase 1: Laying Out Finds  
- The first player takes the next stack of 5 face-down find tiles from the calendar and reveals them.  
- Sort the finds **from youngest to oldest**:  
  - Primary sort: by century (1–5 AC; 1 is youngest, 5 is oldest)  
  - Secondary sort: for same century, by two-digit year (e.g., -50 AC is younger than -57 AC)  
- Place the sorted finds one per gallery:  
  - Gallery I: youngest  
  - Gallery II: second youngest  
  - ...  
  - Gallery V: oldest  
- If a gallery already has 4 finds, skip placing any new find on it.  
- Only place finds where space is available. Return unplaced tiles to the box (do not look at them).

#### Phase 2: Distributing Research Funds  
- Draw 2 research funds cards and place them face-down.  
- Each card shows either a **money bag** (1–4 coins) or a **chest** (5–8 coins).  
- Players (and tomb raider in 2-player game) place their player figures on research funds spaces in clockwise order, starting with the first player.  
- Only one figure per space.  
- After placement, reveal the two cards and total their coin value.  
- Players collect coins from **right to left** based on their position:  
  - The player on the rightmost occupied space takes the amount shown on their space.  
  - Next player to the left takes their amount, if funds remain.  
  - The last player collects all leftover coins (may be more or less than shown).  
- Unused funds are not carried over.

#### Phase 3: Excavating, Exhibiting, Storing Finds  
Players take turns in **order from right to left** on the research funds track.

Each player’s turn includes:

**a) Excavating Finds**  
- May excavate **all finds in one gallery**, provided the gallery matches the excavation range allowed by their research funds space.  
- Cost:  
  - Gallery I: 1 coin  
  - Gallery II: 2 coins  
  - Gallery III: 3 coins  
  - Gallery IV: 4 coins  
  - Gallery V: 5 coins  
- Pay the cost and move all finds from that gallery to your personal area.  
- You may not excavate if you cannot pay.

**b) Exhibiting Collections**  
- A collection consists of matching halves forming one object:  
  - Vase, jug, bracelet, or mask  
- To exhibit:  
  - Combine matching halves into a complete object.  
  - Value = sum of centuries of the components (e.g., 5th + 4th + 3rd = 12 points).  
  - You may **polish** the collection: pay 1 coin per +1 point (max +3 in regular turns; **unlimited in turn 12**).  
- Place an **angular marker** (I, II, or III) in front of the collection.  
- Place the corresponding **circular marker** on the museum exhibition space equal to the collection’s value (max 24).  
- **Immediately receive 1 victory point** (admission ticket) per new collection exhibited.  

**Exhibition Effects:**  
- When a new collection is exhibited, **all existing collections of equal or lower value are moved down one space** on the exhibition plan.  
- If a collection is moved from space 1, it is **removed from the museum**:  
  - Return the circular marker.  
  - Return the finds to the box.  
  - The collection is broken up.  
- If all 3 of your markers are used and you wish to exhibit a new collection, you may **break up one of your existing collections** to free markers.

**c) Storing Finds**  
- After actions, store unexhibited finds:  
  - First 3 finds: free  
  - For each additional 3 finds: pay 1 coin (e.g., 4–6 finds → 1 coin, 7–9 → 2 coins, etc.)  
- If you cannot or will not pay, discard any finds to the box (no cost).  

#### Phase 4: Evaluations (Turns 5, 7, 9, and 12 only)  
- Score victory points:  
  - Receive **VPs equal to the current exhibition space** of each of your collections (e.g., a collection on space 10 → 10 VP).  
  - Awarded via admission tickets (kept secret).  
- Award **special bonus** for oldest exhibited object:  
  - Turn 5: oldest **vase** → +2 VP  
  - Turn 7: oldest **jug** → +2 VP  
  - Turn 9: oldest **mask** → +2 VP  
  - Turn 12: oldest **bracelet** → +2 VP  
- After evaluation:  
  - All exhibition markers move down:  
    - Turn 5: 3 spaces down  
    - Turn 7: 4 spaces down  
    - Turn 9: 5 spaces down  
  - Collections moved out of space 1 are removed (broken up).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Research Funds Bidding  
- Simultaneous hidden selection via placement.  
- Higher bids (right side) get more coins but act later.  
- Risk: high bidders may get less than expected if funds run out.  
- Last player always gets leftovers.

#### Excavation Costs & Depth  
- Deeper galleries (IV, V) are more expensive but contain older (higher-value) finds.  
- Excavation cost is fixed per gallery, regardless of number of finds.

#### Collection Building  
- Players freely reorganize unexhibited finds.  
- Once exhibited, collections are fixed.  
- Polishing increases value at 1 coin = +1 VP (max +3, except final turn).

#### Museum Dynamics  
- New exhibitions devalue older/lower ones (push down one space).  
- Evaluations further devalue all collections (push down 3–5 spaces).  
- Strategic timing of exhibitions is critical.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after **Turn 12**. Final steps:

1. **Final Evaluation** (as in Phase 4):  
   - Score VPs based on current exhibition spaces.  
   - Award +2 VP for oldest exhibited **bracelet**.

2. **Final Bonuses**:  
   - +3 VP for player with **oldest exhibited find**  
   - +2 VP for **second oldest**  
   - +1 VP for **third oldest**  

3. **Total Victory Points** from:  
   - Admission tickets (from evaluations and 1 VP per new exhibit)  
   - Special bonuses (oldest object per evaluation)  
   - Final oldest exhibit bonuses  

**Winning**: Highest total VP wins. Tiebreaker: oldest single find in any exhibited collection.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I excavate a gallery with no finds?**  
A: Yes, but you get nothing. You still pay the cost.

**Q: Can I exhibit a collection worth 0?**  
A: No. Minimum value is 1 (sum of centuries). But you can polish to raise value.

**Q: Can I polish a collection after exhibiting?**  
A: No. Polishing must be done at time of exhibition.

**Q: What if two players tie for oldest vase?**  
A: Only the player with the **strictly oldest** find gets the bonus. Use full date (century + two-digit year) to break ties.

**Q: Can I store more than 6 finds?**  
A: Yes. Storage cost: 1 coin per 3 finds beyond the first 3.

**Q: What happens if all museum spaces are occupied?**  
A: You can still exhibit by breaking up one of your own collections.

**Q: Can I break up an opponent’s collection?**  
A: No. Only your own.
