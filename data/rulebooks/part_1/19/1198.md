## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
THE OBJECT OF THE GAME is to identify SETs of three cards.  
A SET consists of three cards where, for each of the four features (shape, color, number, shading), the attributes are either all the same or all different across the three cards.

2. Components  
- A deck of cards, each with four unique features:  
  - Shape: oval, squiggle, diamond  
  - Color: red, purple, green  
  - Number: one, two, or three symbols  
  - Shading: solid, striped, outlined  
- Twelve cards are laid face-up on the table during gameplay.

3. Setup  
- Shuffle the deck.  
- Deal twelve cards face-up in a grid (e.g., 3x4 or 4x3).  
- All players play simultaneously.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Players look at the twelve cards and search for SETs.  
2. When a player finds a SET, they call "SET!"  
3. The player must then pick up the three cards.  
4. The dealer replaces them with three new cards from the deck.  
5. If no SET is found among the twelve cards, three additional cards are dealt (making 15, then 18, etc.) until a SET is possible.  
6. Play continues until the deck is exhausted and no more SETs can be formed.

5. Core Mechanics  
- A valid SET must satisfy the "all same or all different" rule for each feature independently.  
  For example:  
  - Shapes: all ovals (same), or one oval, one squiggle, one diamond (all different) — both valid.  
  - Colors: all red (same), or red, purple, green (all different) — both valid.  
  - Numbers: all two (same), or one, two, three (all different) — both valid.  
  - Shading: all striped (same), or solid, striped, outlined (all different) — both valid.  
- All four features must individually meet this condition.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Each SET is worth 1 point.  
- Game ends when the deck is empty and no more SETs can be formed from the remaining cards.  
- The player with the most SETs (points) wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can two cards in a SET be identical?  
  A: No. All cards in the deck are unique. A valid SET requires three distinct cards.  
- Q: What if no SET exists in 12 cards?  
  A: Deal 3 more cards (total 15), and continue. After a SET is taken, remove it and replace with new cards to maintain 12 if possible.  
- Q: Can a card be used in more than one SET?  
  A: Yes, but only one SET can be claimed at a time. Once taken, the card is no longer available until returned (if house rules allow).  
- Q: Who replaces the cards after a SET is taken?  
  A: The dealer or any agreed-upon player refills to maintain 12 cards when possible.
