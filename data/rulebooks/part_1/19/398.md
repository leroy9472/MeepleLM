2. **Prepare Cards**:

     - 5 players: use all 30 cards  
3. **Deal Cards**: Deal remaining cards evenly to players.  
4. **Place Components**:  
   - Sort animal tokens by type and place them in piles in the center.  
   - Place the instruction manual backside up as the scoreboard.  
5. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player takes 2 pieces of the same color.  
   - Place one on the "0" space of the scoreboard; keep one in front as player ID.  
   - Return unused player pieces to the box.

   - Starting player takes the other tour piece.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Players take turns clockwise, starting with the starting player.  
2. On your turn:  
   - **Step 1**: Play one card from your hand face-up to the central area.  
     - Place it in a pile corresponding to its animal type.  
     - Overlap cards so all values are visible, with the most recent card on top.  
   - **Step 2**: Take one animal token of any type from the central supply.  
     - The animal taken does **not** need to match the card played.  
     - Place collected tokens in front of you, visible to all.  
3. If no animal tokens are available after playing a card, you skip taking one.  
4. Continue until the end condition is met.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Piles**: Each animal type has a separate pile. The top card determines the point value of that animal.  
- **Animal Collection**: Players collect tokens during their turn, building a visible collection.  
- **Scoring Value**: At round end, each animal token is worth points equal to the value of the **top card** in its animal’s pile.  
  - If no card has been played for an animal, its tokens are worth **0 points**.  
- **Turn Structure**: Strictly two actions: play a card, then take a token. Order cannot be reversed.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End of Round**: Triggered when the **sixth card** of any one animal type is played.  
  - The player who plays this card still takes an animal token (if available).  
  - Round ends immediately after.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - For each animal type, check the top card in its pile.  
  - Multiply the number of tokens you have of that animal by the value of the top card.  
  - Sum all values for your total score this round.  
  - Record score on the scoreboard.  
- **Next Round**:  
  - Return all cards and animal tokens to the center.  
  - Reshuffle all 30 cards.  
  - Remove cards as per player count (same as initial setup).  
  - Re-deal cards.  
  - Rotate starting player to the left.  
  - Move tour tracker forward.  
- **End of Game**:  
  - Play exactly **as many rounds as there are players**.  
  - After final round, sum all scores.  
  - **Winner**: Player with the highest total score.  
  - **Tiebreaker**:  
    - If tied, the player with the highest single-round score wins.  
    - If still tied, share the victory.
