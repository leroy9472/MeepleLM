## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The Pixel Wars have begun! Each player commands a unit led by a unique leader, deploying heroes in tactical formations to outmaneuver and defeat the opponent. The objective is to defeat the opposing leader while protecting your own. Victory is achieved by reducing the enemy leader’s health to zero or below by the end of a wave.

2. Components  
- Two 25-card decks (one per player)  
- Damage counters (preferably ones and fives)  
- One Current Wave Marker (or two: First Player and Second Player markers)  
- Card sleeves (two colors recommended for Constructed Play)  
- ~20 coins (for Draft Mode only)  

3. Setup  
- Shuffle your 25-card deck and draw a starting hand of 5 cards.  
- Each player secretly selects one card from their hand to be their leader, using the leader side of the card.  
- Reveal leaders simultaneously. Place the leader in the center (Flank) position of your unit.  
- If both players reveal the same leader, both return those cards to the bottom of their decks, draw a new card, and repeat leader selection.  
- Randomly determine the first player for the first match. In subsequent matches, the winner of the previous match goes first.  
- Place the Current Wave Marker next to the first player’s Vanguard row to begin.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- The game is played in rounds. Each round consists of three waves:  
  1. Vanguard Wave  
  2. Flank Wave  
  3. Rear Wave  
- In each wave, both players take turns: the first player performs two actions, then the second player performs two actions.  
- After both players complete their actions, advance the Current Wave Marker to the next row.  
- At the end of the Rear Wave, the round ends. Swap the First and Second Player roles for the next round.  
- A new round begins with a Vanguard Wave, continuing until a leader is defeated.

5. Core Mechanics  
Card Roles:  
- Leader: Chosen at start; provides passive bonuses and anchors the unit. Always occupies the center (Flank) position.  
- Hero: Recruited into empty slots during the corresponding wave. Gains abilities based on position:  
  - Vanguard (front): Offensive/defensive powers (red)  
  - Flank (sides): Tactical/support powers (green)  
  - Rear (behind): Ranged attacks or support (blue)  
- Order: One-time effect played from hand (purple box). Resolved and discarded. Some are Ongoing Orders (marked with scroll symbol), placed beside the board and active for a duration.

Actions (choose two per wave):  
- Draw a Card: Draw one card from your deck. Not available if deck is empty. No hand limit.  
- Recruit a Hero: Play a hero from hand into an empty slot in the current wave. Cannot attack this wave.  
- Attack with a Hero or Leader:  
  - Melee Attack: Target the foremost hero or leader in a column. Requires attacker to be in melee position.  
  - Ranged Attack: Target any hero or leader. Requires Ranged Attack ability. Can be blocked by Intercept.  
  - Attack Powers: Optional special effects (e.g., “Attack: opponent discards a card”) used instead of damage. Counts as an attack.  
- Play an Order: Use a card’s purple-box effect. Discard after resolution. Triggers “when you play an order” occur after resolution.  
- Restructure: Move a hero (not leader) to any empty slot. Cannot attack this wave.  
- Clear a Corpse: Move a defeated hero (face-down corpse) to your discard pile. Frees slot for recruitment.

Positional Rules:  
- A hero is “in melee” if it is the foremost in its column. Only these can make melee attacks.  
- Intercept: A hero with this ability blocks ranged attacks from passing over it in its column.  
- Forerunner: The hero directly in front of another.  
- Supporter: The hero directly behind another.

Round 1 Ceasefire:  
- No attacks, attack powers, or offensive orders may be used during the first round (all three waves). Players may only recruit, draw, restructure, or clear corpses.

Casualties:  
- Apply damage counters when a hero or leader is hit.  
- At the end of each wave, check for casualties: any unit with damage ≥ life total is defeated.  
- Remove all damage, flip the card face-down (becomes a corpse). Corpses block recruitment but not movement or ranged attacks.  
- Instant-kill effects (e.g., Assassin’s power) bypass end-of-wave timing and defeat immediately.  
- Corpses may be revived by certain effects or cleared to free space.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- A match ends when, at the end of any wave, one or both leaders have damage ≥ life total.  
- If only one leader is defeated, the other player wins the match.  
- If both leaders are defeated simultaneously:  
  - The player with more living heroes wins.  
  - If tied, the match is a draw.  
- In a draw, both players win the match and claim their own leader as a trophy.  
- Trophies: The defeated leader and the winner’s leader are set aside face-down and not reshuffled into decks.  
- Game Length: Best of 3 or 5 matches. First to 2 (best of 3) or 3 (best of 5) trophies wins.  
- Between Matches:  
  - Each player’s deck is reduced by one card (the used leader).  
  - The player whose opponent has more trophies draws one extra card at start (per trophy the opponent has).  
  - Winner of previous match is first player in next match.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can a hero attack the turn it is recruited?  
  A: No. A recruited hero cannot attack during the wave it is played.  

- Q: Can a hero use both a melee attack and an attack power in the same wave?  
  A: No. Attack powers count as attack actions. A hero can only perform one attack action per wave.  

- Q: Does “when a hero attacks this unit” trigger on attack powers?  
  A: No. Attack powers are not considered “attacking a unit” for such triggers.  

- Q: Can leaders be restructured?  
  A: No. Leaders are fixed in the center position and cannot be moved.  

- Q: What happens if both players have the same leader?  
  A: Both leaders are returned to the bottom of their decks, players draw a new card, and select a new leader. Repeat if necessary.  

- Q: Can you draw if your deck is empty?  
  A: No. The Draw action is unavailable if the deck is empty.  

- Q: Do ongoing orders work if triggered by another card (e.g., Puppeteer)?  
  A: No. Ongoing orders (with scroll symbol) only function when played from hand. They have no effect if triggered by other effects.
