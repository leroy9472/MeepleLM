### 1. Lore & Objective  
**Lore:**  
*The Sword of Rome* simulates Rome’s conquest of Italy from 386 to 272 BC. Players control major powers—Romans, Carthaginians, Greeks, Gauls, Etruscans, and Samnites—competing for territorial dominance. The game emphasizes historical dynamics such as shifting alliances, regional resistance, and the strategic use of mercenary forces and naval power.

**Objective:**  
Win by being the first to reach the automatic victory threshold in Victory Points (VP) by the end of a turn, or by having the highest VP total if no player achieves automatic victory. In a 2-player game, the player whose two powers have the highest combined VP wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn proceeds through the following phases in order:

1. **Etruscan Mine Depletion Check Phase**  
   - Etruscan player checks if they control five or more fewer home spaces than start; if so, mines are depleted and bribe ability is lost.

2. **Draw Cards Phase**  
   - Players discard cards (Gauls must discard all).  
   - Draw to hand size: 8 for Romans, 7 for others (5+ ports in Sicily for Carthaginians in 5-player game).

3. **Determine First Player Phase**  
   - Player with fewest VP chooses who goes first. Place marker on Round Track.

4. **Action Phase (5 Rounds)**  
   - In clockwise order from first player, each becomes active and may:  
     - Propose or break an alliance  
     - Move or place minor leaders  
     - Play a "Neutral Power Activates" card to activate a non-player power  
     - Play one strategy card (activate leader, add/remove support, reinforce if card value is 3, or trigger event)  
   - Response events may be played out of turn.  
   - Desperate Times cards may interrupt turn order.

5. **Attrition Phase**  
   - Non-player powers, then players (highest to lowest VP): roll on attrition table for each enemy space occupied.

6. **Surrender Phase**  
   - Non-player powers, then players (highest to lowest VP):  
     - Place PC markers in enemy spaces occupied by their CU  
     - Roll to siege/subjugate enemy walled cities or tribal spaces with 3+ CU and commander.

7. **Isolation Phase**  
   - Non-player powers, then players (highest to lowest VP):  
     - Replace PC markers with independent markers in spaces not connected via friendly paths to a friendly walled city, reinforcement space, port, or CU.

8. **Scoring Phase**  
   - Adjust VP: +1 per victory space outside home area; -1 per lost home victory space.  
   - Gauls gain/lose VP via plunder track.  
   - Check for automatic victory.

9. **End/Renew Alliances Phase**  
   - All alliances end unless both players agree to renew (in descending VP order).

10. **Reinforcement Phase**  
    - Non-player powers, then players (highest to lowest VP):  
      - Place CU and named leaders in eligible friendly spaces.  
      - Return displaced named leaders.  
      - Reposition minor leaders.  
    - If a player has no CU after this phase, they are eliminated.

11. **End of Turn**  
    - Advance turn marker.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### **Victory Points (VP)**  
- VP are adjusted each turn during the Scoring Phase.  
- **Romans, Greeks, Etruscans, Samnites, Carthaginians:** +1 VP per victory space outside home area; -1 per home victory space lost.  
- **Gauls:** Do not gain VP for victory spaces. Gain/lose VP only via plunder track (filling with Gallic or Transalpine plunder markers), looting, or specific events.  
- VP range: 0–12.

#### **Strategy Cards**  
- Each player has a unique deck.  
- Cards have value (1–3) and event text.  
- May be used to:  
  - Activate a leader (initiative ≤ card value)  
  - Add/remove support (up to card value)  
  - Reinforce (only if card value = 3)  
  - Trigger event (immediate effect)  
- **Response events** (shaded title) can be played out of turn.  
- **Desperate Times cards** (2 per player): interrupt turn order; allow action, card draw, or event play.

#### **Leaders**  
- **Named leaders** (e.g., consuls, Dionysius): have initiative and tactics ratings.  
  - Commanders must be designated; may be changed via activation or event.  
  - **Romans:** Return all consuls each turn; draw two new ones.  
  - **Greeks:** Must pay loyalty penalty (remove city loyalty) to keep named leaders.  
- **Minor leaders:** May be repositioned freely during active player’s turn or reinforcement phase.  
- **Displaced leaders:** Placed in box if alone with enemy CU or all CU eliminated. Returned during reinforcement phase.

#### **Movement**  
- Activate leader with card to move.  
- Max 10 CU may move with leader.  
- Movement Points (MP):  
  - Normal leaders: 4 MP  
  - Gallic leaders: 3 + card value MP (1–3)  
  - Transalpine Gauls: 5 MP  
- Costs:  
  - Clear path: 1 MP  
  - Rough/strait: 2 MP  
  - Naval: 3 MP  
- **Naval movement:** Limited by player and card value. Carthaginians have full naval access.

#### **Interception**  
- Enemy armies may intercept moving armies entering adjacent spaces.  
- Roll ≤ leader’s tactics rating to succeed.  
- Interception gives defender +1 DRM in combat.  
- Moving army may refuse battle (roll ≤ tactics rating).

#### **Avoiding Battle**  
- Enemy may attempt to avoid battle when entered by active army.  
- Roll ≤ tactics rating to retreat to adjacent space.  
- May avoid by naval movement if card allows.  
- Failing to avoid gives attacker +1 DRM.

#### **Combat**  
1. Declare inside/outside city positions.  
2. Intercept/avoid attempts.  
3. Etruscan bribe (if applicable).  
4. Automatic victory check (larger army wins if force ratio ≥ 2:1).  
5. Flanking force activation (if campaign card used).  
6. Combat rolls: 3d6 + modifiers:  
   - Force ratio modifier (based on army size)  
   - Leadership modifier (difference in tactics ratings)  
   - +1 for flanking force  
   - +1 for defender if interception succeeded  
   - -1 for defender if avoidance failed  
   - -2 for attacker crossing rough/strait  
   - ± response events  
7. Highest roll wins; tie = defender wins.  
8. Retreat loser; apply retreat penalties.  
9. Winner gains support (half of loser’s total CU losses, rounded up).

#### **Sieges & Subjugation**  
- **Siege:** Against walled cities. Requires 3+ CU and commander. Roll on Siege/Subjugation Table.  
- **Subjugation:** Against tribal spaces. Same procedure.  
- Success when siege level ≥ city loyalty or tribal subjugation factor.  
- **Looting:** Gauls/Transalpine Gauls may loot instead of converting: destroy city, place 5 plunder markers.

#### **Plunder (Gauls)**  
- **Raids:** Spend 1 MP to raid enemy PC space. Roll on Siege Table. Success = replace PC with independent, place plunder marker.  
- **Looting:** After battle or siege, place plunder markers instead of support.  
- **Plunder Track:** Fill with Gallic plunder = +1 VP and clear track. Fill with Transalpine = -1 VP and clear.  
- **Gallic Solidarity:** Spend plunder markers to remove enemy PC markers in Gallic home spaces.

#### **Alliances**  
- Proposed/broken during active turn.  
- Effects:  
  - No combat between allies  
  - +1 DRM in combat on allied territory  
  - Retreat into allied spaces allowed  
  - May not stack  
- Automatically end each turn; may be renewed.  
- Breaking alliance costs 3 support (from walled cities first).

#### **Non-Player Powers (Volsci, Transalpine Gauls, Carthaginians)**  
- Activated via "Neutral Power Activates" cards.  
- Controlled by:  
  - Player who activates (during activation)  
  - Player with fewest VP and not allied with active player (otherwise)  
- Movement restrictions:  
  - Volsci: Must end in Antium or Roman home space  
  - Transalpine Gauls: Must end in Gallic home space  
  - Carthaginians (base game): Cannot enter Italy

#### **Carthaginian Unrest (5-Player Game)**  
- Unrest level increased by Neutral Power cards (except Carthaginian).  
- Max level = 10 – CU in Garrison Box.  
- Effects:  
  - Reduces hand size (unrest/2, rounded down)  
  - Reduces VP (unrest/3, rounded down)  
- Reduced by winning battles or attacking unrest in Garrison Box.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Automatic Victory:** Achieved if any player’s VP ≥ threshold on VP track at end of Scoring Phase. Game ends; highest VP wins (tiebreaker: Gauls > Etruscans > Samnites > Greeks > Carthage > Romans).  
- **Game-End Victory:** If no automatic victory, highest VP wins.  
- **2-Player Game:** Highest combined VP of two powers wins; tie = Gallic-Greek win.

---

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Ties:** Resolved in order: Gauls > Etruscans > Samnites > Greeks > Carthage > Romans.  
- **Displaced Leaders:** Named leaders displaced if alone with enemy CU (no friendly walled city); minor leaders set aside.  
- **Naval Retreat:** Defeated forces in port may retreat by sea if card allows. Invading armies do not need extra card.  
- **Campaign Cards:** Allow two activations; may coordinate attacks (flanking force).  
- **Etruscan Bribe:** Costs 3-value card; removed from game. Prevents battle; enemy backs up.  
- **Mine Depletion:** Permanent; disables Etruscan bribe ability.  
- **Carthaginian Mercenaries (5-player):** Hired via card play; number = card value. Removed at end of turn (half, rounded up).  
- **Greek Loyalty Penalty:** Must reduce city loyalty to keep named leaders; mitigated in 5-player game by controlling Carthaginian Sicilian spaces.
