## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Players represent noble families in medieval Germany vying for power and influence in a bid to claim the Emperor's throne. Over 5 rounds, players gain victory points (VPs) by becoming Emperor, controlling provinces (Electorates), building cities, marrying off daughters, voting in elections, and leveraging special privileges. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.

  - 7 Noble tiles

Separate Action cards into 13 face-up stacks by type.

Randomly select a Start Player. They become the initial Emperor:

2. All players place Couple (age 35) on a free Noble position in any Province.
3. All players place Baron (age 25) on a free Noble position in any Province.
4. All players place Couple (age 15) on a free Noble position in any Province.
5. All players place one Knight on a free Noble or Castle position.
6. All players place Taler Marker and Cardboard Marker on 7 on Taler Track (dark-blue and light-blue sides).

Phases 1–3 are skipped in Round 1. Game starts at Phase 4.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 5 rounds. Each round has 8 phases:

1. **Income** – All players gain Talers.
2. **Aging** – Nobles age; those at 45 retire.
3. **Descendants** – Players give birth to son or daughter based on Action cards.
4. **Actions** – Players buy cards, use privileges, or pass.
5. **New Electors** – Determine new Electors per Province based on influence.
6. **Emperor Election** – If triggered, elect new Emperor.
7. **Emperor’s Actions** – Current Emperor gains VPs and/or Talers.
8. **Next Round** – Advance Round Marker.

Phases 3 and 4 proceed clockwise starting with Emperor. Other phases are simultaneous.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Phase 1: Income
Each player collects:
- 6 Talers (base)
- 1 Taler per City they control
- 1 Taler per opponent’s City in a Province where they are Elector
- 2 extra Talers if they are Elector of Sachsen

Max 12 Talers; excess is forfeited. Emperor Cities provide no income.

#### Phase 2: Aging
- All Nobles (Barons and Couples) age +10 years (rotate 90° clockwise).
- Any Noble at age 45 at start of phase returns to player’s pool.
- If Emperor is removed (age 45), the Emperor player must:
  - Place one of their non-Elector Nobles on the Emperor Throne, or
  - Use a Baron (age 45) from their pool if no Nobles on board.

#### Phase 3: Descendants
Players compare pink and blue Action cards from previous round:
- **More blue cards** → Son: Place a Baron (age 15) in a free Noble position. If none, replace an opponent’s or own Knight on a Noble position (not Castle).
- **Equal or more pink cards** → Daughter: Propose marriage to an opponent’s Baron (not in Religious Province as Elector).
  - If accepted: Opponent flips Baron to Couple. Proposer gains 1 VP.
  - If rejected: Proposer gains 1 Taler.
- Cannot propose to own Baron or Religious Elector.
- No cards = no descendant.

All Action cards are returned to stacks after this phase.

#### Phase 4: Actions
Starting with Emperor, players take turns choosing one:
- **Buy and use an Action card**
- **Use an Elector’s privilege**
- **Pass** (once passed, no further actions)

A player may only buy a card if they can perform its action. Cards have phase icons indicating when they take effect.

**Action Cards (by type):**
- **Become Emperor (Rival)**: Triggers Emperor election. Ends Phase 4 for the player. Emperor cannot take.
- **Medicine (Doctor)**: Reduce age of own Noble by 10, or increase opponent’s by 10.
- **Move (Ordinance)**: Move own Baron or Couple to another Province’s Noble position. Cannot move Elector or Emperor. May replace Knight if no space.
- **Pope**: Gain 1 extra vote in Emperor election.
- **Religious Influence (Church Influence)**: Choose one Religious Province. All your and allies’ Nobles/Knights of same color in that Province gain +1 vote each.
- **Excommunication (Exclusion)**: Choose one Public Province to be excluded from Emperor election.
- **Doge (Indulgence)**: Gain 1 VP.
- **Emigration (Permit)**: Place Baron (age 15, 3 Talers) or Couple (age 15, 5 Talers) in free Noble position. May replace Knight.
- **City Building (Ordinance)**: Place City on free City space. Gain:
  - 1 VP for first and second City
  - 2 VP for third City
- **Ascent Knight (Promotion)**: Replace your Knight on a Noble position with a Baron (age 15).
- **Daughter of Foreign King (Foreign Daughter)**: Flip one of your Barons to Couple (same age). Cannot be used on Religious Elector.
- **Knight**: Place or move your Knight to free Noble or Castle position. Cannot replace Nobles or other Knights. This card remains in center and is always available.
- **Brandenburg (Gray Eminence)**: Only player with Elector in Brandenburg may take. At start of Phase 5, place a Baron (age 45) from pool on a Province of choice (left of Privilege). Gains +1 Influence Point. Removed after Phase 2 next round.

#### Phase 5: New Electors
For each Province:
- Calculate Influence Points:
  - Knight: 1
  - Baron: 1
  - Couple: 2
  - City: 1
  - Emperor City: 1 (only for current Emperor)
- Player with highest total becomes Elector.
- Tie: Emperor chooses winner.

**Outcomes:**
- **Elector replaced**: New Elector gains 2 VP. Replaces old Elector with one of their Nobles from that Province. Old Elector goes to free Noble position (or player’s pool if none).
- **Elector unchanged**: No VP, except in Mainz (see below).
- **No replacement possible**: Old Elector moves to Noble position; Elector space vacant. No VP. Province cannot vote in next election.

**Religious Province Rules (Trier, Mainz, Köln)**:
- Only Barons (not Couples) may be Electors.
- Elector cannot marry (cannot be flipped).

#### Phase 6: Emperor Election
Occurs **only** if a player took "Become Emperor" card in Phase 4.

**Eligibility:**
- Candidates: Current Emperor and player who took "Become Emperor"
- Voters: All players with at least 1 vote. Emperor and Rival always participate.

**Vote Calculation:**
- 1 vote per Elector controlled
- Bohmen: 2 votes instead of 1
- Modifiers: Pope (+1), Religious Influence (+votes in chosen Religious Province), Exclusion (removes Public Province)

**Voting:**
1. Players secretly choose "For Emperor" or "Against Emperor" using Vote card.
2. Emperor and Rival must vote for themselves.
3. All players must vote.

5. Winner: Most votes. Tie → Emperor remains.

**Transition:**
