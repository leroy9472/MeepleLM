## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
In *Indian Summer*, players take a walk through a New England forest during a warm autumn season. As leaves fall, players collect treasures—Berries, Nuts, Mushrooms, and Feathers—while placing leaf tiles to cover their personal Forest Floor. The goal is to be the first to completely cover your Forest Floor with Leaf tiles and Squirrels. If multiple players finish, tiebreakers are resolved using Nuts and other Treasures.

2. **Components**  
- 2 game board pieces (multiplayer side)  
- 75 Leaf tiles: 17 green (3-space), 29 yellow (4-space), 29 red (5-space)  
- 6 Forest Floor boards (each with 6 Areas of 12 spaces)  
- 20 Animal tiles (puzzle-shaped, no holes)  
- 32 Squirrel tokens  
- 4 Backpacks (player markers for tile order)  
- 1 Berry Bush (standee)  
- 1 Hiking Shoes token (first player marker)  
- 80 Treasure tokens:  
  - 30 Berries  
  - 24 Nuts  
  - 18 Mushrooms  
  - 8 Feathers  

3. **Setup**  
1. Place the two game boards side by side in the center.  
2. Sort Animal tiles and place them on designated spaces on the central boards.  
3. Place Treasure tokens on the three marked Animal tiles: Raccoon, Fox, and Badger.  
4. Form a circular Common Path of Leaf tiles around the boards, leaving one gap.  
5. Insert the Berry Bush into the gap.  
6. Each player receives:  
   - 1 Forest Floor board (choose side)  
   - 1 Backpack (place at bottom-left of board)  
   - 5 Leaf tiles: 2 green, 2 yellow, 1 red (placed left to right from Backpack) — this is the Player Path  
   - 1 Berry, 1 Nut, 1 Mushroom (placed above Backpack)  
7. Remaining Leaf tiles go into a supply.  
8. The last player to have taken a walk in the forest takes the Hiking Shoes and begins.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn:  
- Perform **1 Main Action** (only one).  
- Perform **any number of Special Actions**, before and/or after the Main Action.  

**Turn Order**:  
1. Choose and execute one Main Action.  
2. Optionally execute any number of Special Actions.  
3. Optionally claim an Animal tile if eligible.  
4. Refill Player Path if last tile was taken.  
5. End turn.

5. **Core Mechanics**  

**Main Actions (choose one per turn)**  
- **Place 1 Leaf Tile**: Take any Leaf tile from your Player Path and place it on your Forest Floor. May rotate/flip. Hole may cover blank space or Treasure.  
- **Place 1 Squirrel**: Take a Squirrel from the common supply and place it on an empty space on your Forest Floor.  

**Alternative Main Actions (in place of placing a Leaf or Squirrel)**  
- **Spend 1 Mushroom**: Take the first Leaf tile (closest to Backpack) from **2 different players** and place both on your Forest Floor (order of placement is your choice).  
  - In 2-player: take one from opponent and one from the Common Path (next to Bush).  
  - If a player loses their last tile, they immediately refill their Player Path.  
- **Spend 1 Feather**: Place **2 Leaf tiles** from your Player Path on your Forest Floor (order of your choice). Must have at least 2 tiles available.

**Special Actions (any number, any time during turn)**  
- **Spend 1 Berry**: Refill your Player Path to 5 Leaf tiles from the Common Path (starting next to Bush, moving clockwise).  
  - If already have 5, may take a **6th tile** (never more than 6).  
- **Spend 1 Nut**: Take 1 Squirrel from supply and place on empty space on your Forest Floor.  
  - If this completes an Area, immediately collect Treasures from that Area.

**Treasure Collection**  
- When the **Hole** of a Leaf tile covers a **Treasure space** (Berry, Nut, Mushroom, Feather) on the board, take a matching Treasure token and place it on the hole.  
- When an **Area (12-space section)** is fully covered (by Leaf tiles and/or Squirrels), collect **all Treasure tokens** on holes within that Area into your personal supply.

**Claiming Animal Tiles**  
- At any time during your turn, if you have a continuous outline of **empty holes** that **exactly matches** the shape of an available Animal tile:  
  - Place the Animal tile over the holes.  
  - Take one Treasure token for **each Treasure symbol** under the Animal tile.  
  - If the Animal tile had a starting Treasure (Raccoon, Fox, Badger), take that token too.  
- Holes must be **empty of Treasure tokens** before placing Animal.  
- Animal tiles may only cover holes (no solid tile areas).  
- You may use a smaller Animal tile even if a larger shape exists.

**Refilling Player Path**  
- When you take your **last Leaf tile** from your Player Path:  
  1. Take tile next to Bush on Common Path.  
  2. Move Bush clockwise to next tile.  
  3. Repeat until you have 5 tiles.  
- Maintain order of tiles on both paths.  
- If Common Path has <7 tiles, refill it from supply (random tiles, continue path).

**Treasure Exchange (any time during your turn)**  
- 2 of same → 1 of next higher:  
  - 2 Berries → 1 Nut  
  - 2 Nuts → 1 Mushroom  
  - 2 Mushrooms → 1 Feather  
- Downgrade:  
  - 1 Feather → 1 Mushroom → 1 Nut → 1 Berry (one at a time)  
- May exchange as often as desired.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- **End Game Trigger**: When any player completely covers their Forest Floor.  
- **Finish the round**: All players, including the one who triggered the end, get one final turn.  
- **Final Actions**:  
  - Exchange all Treasures into Nuts (via exchange rules).  
  - Use Nuts to place Squirrels on remaining empty spaces.  
  - If placing Squirrels completes Areas, collect Treasures and continue exchanging/placing.  
- **Winning**:  
  - The first player to fully cover their board **wins**, **unless** others also finish.  
  - **Tiebreaker**: All players who finished count **Nuts in supply**. Most Nuts wins.  
  - If still tied: Player with **at least 1 Berry** wins.  
  - If still tied: Players share victory.  
- **Non-winners**: Count empty spaces. Fewer = better.
