# Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

In *The Battle of Five Armies*, two players reenact the climactic battle from J.R.R. Tolkien’s *The Hobbit*. The Free Peoples (FP) player commands Dwarves, Elves, and Men, while the Shadow (SP) player controls Goblins, Wargs, and other dark forces. The game culminates in a struggle for control of key locations around the Lonely Mountain, with fate, leadership, and heroic characters determining the outcome.

**Objective:**  
The FP player wins immediately if:
- Bolg is eliminated.
- Beorn enters play and the SP has fewer than 6 Victory Points (VPs).
- The Fate marker reaches step 15 on the Fate track.

The SP player wins if:
- They have 10 or more VPs at the end of a turn.
- They have 10 VPs and control Front Gate (immediate win).

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Action Dice
Players roll dice equal to their action pool:
- FP: 5 dice (6 if Thorin or Beorn is in play).
- SP: 6 dice (7 if controlling 2 settlements/fortifications in same territory).

Die results allow:
- **Character:** Move character(s), move army with Leadership up to 2 regions, or attack with such army.
- **Army:** Move 2 armies, attack with 1 army, or launch combined attack.
- **Muster:** Flip recruitment tokens in 2 regions, rally 2 armies, or play Muster card.
- **Muster/Army:** Either Muster or Army action.
- **Event:** Draw 1 Event and 1 Story card, or play any card.
- **Lidless Eye (SP only):** Move/attack with Goblin armies, muster Goblins, rally, or play Master card.
- **Will of the West (FP only):** Use as any other die.

#### Characters & Generals
- **Generals (FP):** Bard, Thranduil, Gandalf, Dain, Lord of the Eagles. Each has a special ability usable once per turn if activated.
- **Beorn:** Enters with 8 Wrath tokens. Can move 3 regions with Will of the West die, or 1 region with Character die (discard 1 Wrath). Attacks like an army (4 dice at 5+, re-roll misses once). Damage removes Wrath tokens. Immediate FP win if he enters play and SP has <6 VPs.
- **Bolg (SP):** Enters when SP controls at least one Valley region. Starts with 1 Bodyguard (3 if Ruins of Dale controlled). Can cancel all damage by discarding a Bodyguard. If eliminated, FP wins immediately.
- **Lord of the Eagles:** Not a normal character. Use his ability to move all Eagles from Eyrie to any region. Then spend a Muster die to return Eagles to Eyrie and attack a SP army in that territory (3 dice at 4+, re-roll misses once).

#### Movement
- Armies move to adjacent regions unless blocked by river (impassable unless ford) or black border.
- **Strategic Movement:** Move 2 armies (Army die).
- **Fast Movement:** Move 1 army up to 2 regions (Character die, if army has Leadership).
- **Splitting/Merging:** Armies may split during movement. Merge when ending in same region (max 5 units; excess removed, 2 damage tokens per unit removed).
- **Stacking Limit:** Max 5 units per region (except Mustering regions).

#### Mustering
- FP: Flip recruitment tokens in 2 regions (Muster die).
- SP: Place 1 Goblin in each Mustering Point (Lidless Eye die), or flip tokens (Muster die).
- Units must be placed where token is located; replace token with unit(s).
- If army enters region with enemy token, token is removed and reshuffled.

#### Rallying
- Spend Muster die to rally up to 2 armies.
- Roll one die per unit: 5 or 6 removes 1 damage token.
- Re-roll failed dice up to army’s Leadership value.

#### Mountain Passes
- Closed at start. Open when Mustering Point has ≥5 units.
- Once open, SP may move Goblins from Mustering Point to Mountain Pass, then to adjacent region.
- Mountain Pass is not adjacent to any region; no units may enter, retreat, or attack into it.

#### Combat

**Initiation:**  
- Attacker moves army into adjacent enemy region and uses Attack action.

**Combat Sequence (per round):**

1. **Maneuvering:**  
   - Both players simultaneously reveal a card: Unit card (for maneuver), Event (combat effect), Regroup, or Special Maneuver.
   - **Special Maneuvers (always succeed, no roll needed):**
     - *Regroup:* Return all played Unit/Special cards to hand; allows retreat.
     - *Vampire-like (SP):* If 1+ damage dealt, discard 1 Great Bat for +1 damage. Card returns to hand after round.
     - *Mighty Strokes (Thorin):* +1 to combat roll or re-roll; usable only once per combat unless Regroup played.

2. **Combat Roll:**  
   - Roll dice = total Combat rating of units (max 5 dice).
   - If a Unit card was played, replace one white die per matching unit with black die.
   - Hit on 5+ (6+ if attacking fortification, across ford, or up slope in first round).
   - If any black die hits, unit’s maneuver ability triggers.

3. **Leader Re-roll:**  
   - Army with Leadership may re-roll up to Leadership value of missed dice.

4. **Apply Damage:**  
   - Add damage tokens equal to hits.
   - Fortifications absorb damage until broken (value reached), then damage applies to army.
   - If damage > units, must take casualties (remove 2 damage per unit removed).

5. **End of Round:**  
   - Attacker may withdraw (ends combat).
   - If not, defender may:
     - **Retreat:** If Regroup was played — move to valid adjacent region.
     - **Rout:** If Regroup not played — take casualties to reduce damage to 0–1, then retreat.
   - If defender retreats, routs, or is eliminated, attacker may advance (with all or part of army).

#### Combined Attacks
- Use Army die’s Combined Attack action.
- Only one attacking army fights per round; attacker chooses which.
- Terrain and slope/ford penalties apply only on first attack.
- Unit/Special cards are recovered when switching armies.

#### Fate Mechanism
- SP draws up to number of FP’s activated generals.
- Must apply effect of last tile drawn.
- Fate marker advances by number on tile.
- If tile has Fate icon, FP draws and plays a Fate card immediately.
- If Fate marker reaches step 15, FP wins.
- Special red/blue tiles: must stop and apply immediately.

#### Great Bats (SP)
- Placed during Shadow Leadership phase (max 6).
- Affect entire territory, not just region.
- **Bat Cloud:** Spend Muster die, remove 1 Great Bat to move 1 SP army in that territory.
- **Vampire-like:** If ≥1 Great Bat in defender’s territory, SP gains Vampire-like card for that combat. If used and damage dealt, discard 1 Bat for +1 damage. Card returns to hand after round.

#### Fortifications
- Ravenhill, Front Gate, Eastern Spur.
- Each has a value (damage tokens absorbed before broken).
- While intact, attackers must roll 6+ to hit.
- Damage to fortification is permanent.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can Beorn move through a SP-controlled settlement?**  
  Yes, and doing so recaptures it for FP (remove control marker).

- **Can Beorn be attacked?**  
  Yes, by adjacent SP armies. He fights alone, using his own combat rules.

- **What happens to unused Great Bats?**  
  All are removed at end of turn.

- **Can Thorin’s Mighty Strokes be reused?**  
  Only if Regroup card is played during combat.

- **Can Eagles attack multiple times in a turn?**  
  No. After attacking, they return to Eyrie and cannot be used again until next turn.

- **Does terrain superiority apply to Beorn?**  
  No. Beorn ignores terrain superiority and does not use maneuver cards.

- **Can Bolg be attacked alone?**  
  No. Bolg cannot be attacked or attack unless part of an army.

- **What if no valid retreat path exists?**  
  If defender cannot retreat, attacker chooses a valid region (if any), and retreating army takes +1 damage. If no region possible, retreat is blocked.

- **Can Fate cards be played outside of Fate phase?**  
  Only if drawn via Fate tile with Fate icon — then played immediately.
