## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
You're a kid building a fort, gathering friends (cards), pizza, and toys to score victory points (VPs). The goal is to have the most VPs at game end by:  
- Scoring through card actions  
- Increasing your Fort Level (which also boosts capacities)  
- Fulfilling a secret Made-Up Rule  
- Possibly claiming the Macaroni Sculpture (first to Fort Level 5)  

The player with the most VPs wins. Tiebreaker: highest Fort Level; if still tied, share victory.

2. Components  
- 60 Kid cards (deckbuilding pool)  
- 10 Best Friend cards (2 per player, marked with ★)  
- 30 Pizza tokens, 30 Toys tokens  
- 11 Made-Up Rule cards (secret objectives)  
- 9 Perk cards (persistent or one-time abilities)  
- 1 Macaroni Sculpture card (end-game trigger & 4 VP)

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has 5 phases:  
1. **Cleanup:** Discard all cards in your Yard to your discard pile. (Skip on first turn.)  
2. **Play:**  
   - Play one card from hand (the "played card").  
   - Use one or both actions (Public or Private), in any order, but finish one before starting the other.  
   - You may add suits to improve actions:  
     - Play cards from hand showing matching suits (added cards).  
     - Use matching suits from cards in your Lookout.  
     - Added cards only contribute suits, not actions.  
     - You cannot add a card unless at least one of its suits changes the outcome of an action you use.  
   - You must fully use at least one of the two actions (including any improvements).  
   - After resolving actions, other players may follow the Public action.  
3. **Recruit:** Must recruit one card into your discard pile from:  
   - Park (replace with top of Park deck)  
   - Any opponent’s Yard  
   - Top of Park deck  
4. **Discard:**  
   - Discard played card, added cards, and any Best Friends still in hand to your discard pile.  
   - Place remaining hand cards face-up in your Yard (rivals may recruit them).  
5. **Draw:** Draw 5 cards from your deck.  
   - If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck and continue.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Suits:** Squirtgun, Skateboard, Shovel, Glue, Crown, Book (wild), Coin (wild, declared at use).  
- **Actions:**  
  - Gather Resource: Gain Pizza or Toys to Stuff (max 4 each). If choice, all must be same type.  
  - Pack Resource: Move resource from Stuff to Pack.

- **Modifiers:**

  - **Then (→):** Do left action, then right action. Must do left to do right; must do right if able.  
  - **Parentheses:** Group actions; when multiplied, repeat entire group.  
- **Following:**  
  - After leader resolves, others may follow Public action by discarding one matching suit card.  
  - Must follow action fully.  
  - If leader used Coin, they declare suit; followers must match that suit.  
  - If leader gathered, followers must take same resource type.  
  - If leader didn’t gather or didn’t use action, followers choose their own resource.  
  - Cards in Lookout cannot be used to follow.  
- **Lookout:**  
  - Holds up to (Fort Level + 1) cards.  
  - Cards are never removed.  
  - Only contributes suits when you play a card; never affects following.  
- **Pack:**  
  - Holds up to (Fort Level + 1) resources.  
  - Used for scoring (Made-Up Rules), copying, or paying costs.  
- **Fort Level:**  
  - Increases via Advance Fort action (pay cost between levels).  
  - At Level 1: secretly take one Made-Up Rule.  
  - At Level 2: take one Perk card.  
  - At Level 5: take Macaroni Sculpture (triggers end game; worth 4 VP).

6. Scoring & End Game  
End game triggers when any of:  
- A player reaches 25+ VPs  
- A player reaches Fort Level 5  
- Park deck is empty  

When triggered, finish the current round (all players equal turns). Then score:  
- VPs on Victory Track  
- + Fort Level  
- + Made-Up Rule (reveal and score)  
- + Macaroni Sculpture (if held, +4 VP)  

Highest total wins. Tiebreaker: highest Fort Level; if still tied, share victory.
