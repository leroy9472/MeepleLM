## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Rails & Sails is a map-building strategy game in the Ticket to Ride series, combining train and ship routes across global or regional maps (World Map or Great Lakes). Players claim routes, build harbors in port cities, and complete destination tickets to earn points. The goal is to score the most points by completing routes, building harbors, and fulfilling destination tickets.

2. Components  
- World Map or Great Lakes Map  
- Plastic trains and ships by color (player pieces)  
- Train cards (colored and wild locomotives)  
- Ship cards (colored and wild locomotives)  
- Destination Tickets (including Tour Tickets)  
- Scoring markers  

Player Supply per Color:  
- World Map: 25 Trains, 50 Ships  
- Great Lakes: 33 Trains, 32 Ships  
Each player also receives 3 Harbors.

3. Setup  
- Shuffle Train and Ship decks separately.  
- Each player draws:  
  - 3 Train cards (2 for Great Lakes)  
  - 7 Ship cards (2 for Great Lakes)  
  - 6 Destination Tickets, keeps at least 3  
- Players secretly choose 60 pieces (World Map) or 50 pieces (Great Lakes) from their supply; discard extras.  
  - Suggested starting split:  
    - World Map: 20 Trains & 40 Ships  
    - Great Lakes: 27 Trains & 23 Ships  
- Create two face-up display piles:  
  - 3 Train cards and 3 Ship cards  
  - Replace any drawn face-up card immediately from the respective deck  
  - If a newly revealed card is a Wild, the current player cannot take it that turn  
- If 3 Wild cards are face-up at once (any combination), discard all 6 face-up cards and replace with 3 Train and 3 Ship cards  

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a turn, a player performs exactly one of the following actions:  
1. **Pick up Train or Ship cards**  
   - Take 2 cards: either  
     - One face-up card (Train or Ship), then immediately replace it  
     - Two blind cards (one from Train deck, one from Ship deck)  
   - Exception: If a face-up card taken is Wild, player may only take one card that turn  
   - Wild cards (locomotives) can represent any Train or Ship card  

2. **Claim a Route**  
   - Play a set of Train or Ship cards matching the route’s color, length, and type  
   - Gray routes can be claimed with any single color of Train or Ship cards  
   - Double Ship cards allow playing up to 2 ships per card  
     - Example: A 5-space route can be claimed with 2 Double Ship cards and 1 Single Ship card  
     - Excess ships (e.g., playing 3 Double Ship cards for a 5-space route) are lost  
   - Pair Routes (World Map only):  
     - Each space requires 2 Train cards of the same color  
     - Color can vary per space  
     - Wilds can substitute in pairs  
   - Double Routes: Only one route in a double-track section can be claimed by a single player  
   - A player may claim any route, even if unconnected to existing routes  
   - Only one route may be claimed per turn  

3. **Draw Destination Tickets**  
   - Draw 4 new tickets  
   - Must keep at least 1  
   - Add to existing tickets  

4. **Build a Harbor**  
   - May build in a port city (marked with anchor symbol ‡)  
   - Requirements:  
     - Player has at least one claimed route into the city  
     - Play 2 Train cards and 2 Ship cards  
     - All 4 cards must be the same color and have harbor symbols  
     - Wild cards can substitute for any required card  
   - Only one harbor per port city allowed (by any player)  

5. **Exchange Plastic Pieces**  
   - Swap pieces in your supply with previously removed (discarded) pieces  
   - Penalty: Lose 1 point per piece exchanged  
   - Done at the end of your turn  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Route Claiming**: Cards must match route color, length, and type. Points awarded based on route length.  
- **Harbor Building**: Requires 2 matching Train and 2 matching Ship cards (same color, with harbor symbols).  
- **Wild Cards**: Can be used as any Train or Ship card, including for harbor construction.  
- **Map Wrapping**: Eastern and western edges of the map connect (as shown by arrows).  
- **Tour Tickets**:  
  - Involve visiting 3+ cities in a specified order  
  - Scoring:  
    - Full order: High value (large number bottom left)  
    - Completed out of order: Lower value (smaller number bottom left)  
    - Uncompleted: Negative value (bottom right)  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End Signal**: When any player has 6 or fewer plastic pieces (trains + ships) remaining, each player (including that player) takes 2 more turns.  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - Route points: Based on length (per Route Scoring Table)  
  - Destination Tickets:  
    - Positive points for completed tickets  
    - Negative points for uncompleted tickets  
  - Harbor Bonuses:  
    - Awarded when a completed ticket includes a harbor city  
    - World Map:  
      - 1 harbor on ticket: 20 pts  
      - 2 harbors on ticket: 30 pts  
      - 3+ harbors on ticket: 40 pts  
      - 2+ harbors named on same ticket: 40 pts (each harbor counts)  
    - Great Lakes:  
      - 1 harbor: 10 pts  
      - 2 harbors: 20 pts  
      - 3+ harbors: 30 pts  
  - **Harbor Penalty**: Lose 4 points for each harbor not built by the end of the game  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I claim a route not connected to my network?** Yes.  
- **Can I build more than one harbor in a city?** No. Only one harbor per port city.  
- **Can I use Wilds for harbor construction?** Yes. One Wild can replace any of the 4 required cards.  
- **What if I draw a Wild when replacing a face-up card?** The next player may not take it unless they use an action to draw blind.  
- **What happens if I run out of face-up cards?** Replenish to 3 of each type immediately.  
- **Can I exchange pieces mid-game?** Yes, during your turn, as your action or after another action, but lose 1 point per piece swapped.  
- **Do unused Double Ship cards have value?** No. Only used during route claiming.  
- **Can I claim both tracks on a double route?** No. Only one per player. In 2- or 3-player games, claiming one makes the other unavailable to all.
