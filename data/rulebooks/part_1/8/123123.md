## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
BattleCON is a tactical fighting game set in the World of Indines. Players take on the role of unique fighters, each with distinct abilities and playstyles. The objective is to reduce your opponent's life to zero by executing well-timed attacks, managing resources, and outmaneuvering them on the board. Victory is achieved by eliminating all opposing fighters.

2. Components  
- Fighter kits (Styles, Bases, Unique Ability cards, Standups)  
- Switch Style card (shared by all fighters)  
- Finisher cards (double-sided, one per fighter)  
- Overload Tiles (Power Up!, Defense Up!, Speed Up!)  
- Force Counters (45 total, shared pool)  
- Life Counters (start at 20 per fighter)  
- Reference Cards (track opponent’s available cards)  
- Tokens & Counters (circular tokens for abilities; pentagonal counters for resources)  
- Status Effect Cards, Markers, Special Cards, Forms  
- Game board (9-space for multiplayer, standard 2-player side)  
- Spin-down Life and Beat Counters  
- Arena Cards (double-sided for thematic boards)

3. Setup  
- Each player selects a fighter and takes their full kit.  
- Place standups on starting positions: third and fifth spaces for 2-player.  
- Set Life to 20, place 45 Force Counters in a shared pool.  
- Each player takes 2 Force Counters to start.  
- Each player receives 3 Overload Tiles.  
- Perform fighter-specific UA setup steps (e.g., placing tokens, markers).  
- Choose and reveal one side of your Finisher card.  
- Trade Reference Cards with your opponent.  
- Randomly assign Active Player Marker.  
- Create two initial Discard Piles: each player discards two Styles and two Bases (one pair per pile).

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Set Phase**: Each player selects one Style and one Base, places them face-down as an Attack Pair.  
2. **Ante Phase**: Starting with Active Player, players alternate using ante actions (Overloads, UA effects, [Opponent] antes). Phase ends when both pass consecutively.  
3. **Reveal Phase**: Simultaneously reveal Attack Pairs. Resolve Reveal triggers (Active Player first).  
4. **Check Priority**: Higher Priority becomes Active Player. Tie? → Clash (see below).  
5. **Start of Beat**: Active Player resolves all Start triggers, then Reactive Player.  
6. **Active Player Attack**:  
   a. Before Activating triggers  
   b. Check Range  
   c. On Hit (if in range): Hit triggers  
   d. Deal Damage → On Damage (if ≥1 damage)  
   e. After Activating triggers (even if attack missed)  
7. **Reactive Player Attack**: Only if not stunned. Same steps as above.  
8. **End of Beat**: Active Player resolves End triggers, then Reactive Player.  
9. **Recycle Phase**:  
   - Resolve Recycle triggers  
   - Pick up oldest Discard Pile into hand  
   - Shift remaining Discard Pile outward  
   - Place used Attack Pair into first Discard Pile  
   - Each player gains 1 Force (2 if at 7 or less life)  
   - If Force pool is empty → Time Over (final beat)

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Attack Pairs**: Combine one Style + one Base. Stats and effects combine.  
- **Stats**:  
  - Range: Min~Max; adds across cards.  
  - Power: Damage dealt on hit.  
  - Priority: Determines turn order; higher acts first.  
  - Guard: Resist stun; if damage > Guard → stunned.  
- **Triggers**: Occur at specific timings:  
  - Reveal, Start, Before, Hit, Damage, After, End, Recycle  
  - In-Time Triggers (purple): Respond to events (e.g., "When hit...")  
- **Clash**: Priority tie → both play new Base face-down, reveal, recalculate. Repeat if needed.  
- **Tiebreaker (▲)**: Attack with ▲ wins tie; no Clash occurs if either has tiebreaker.  
- **Movement**:  
  - Advance (toward), Retreat (away), Push, Pull, Close (advance up to but not past), Teleport  
  - Cannot occupy same space as another standup; hop over fighters when moving.  
- **Stun**: If damage taken > Guard → stunned → cannot attack.  
- **Overloads**: Spend 2 Force to use once per beat:  
  - Power Up! (+2 Power)  
  - Defense Up! (+2 Guard)  
  - Speed Up! (+2 Priority)  
- **Finishers**: Replace Attack Pair when revealed via Switch Style. Removed from game after use.  
- **Tokens/Counters**:  
  - Use: gain effect, then deplete  
  - Regain: move from Depletion to Supply  
  - Spend/Deplete: move to Depletion without effect  
  - Crash: remove from game  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory Condition**: Reduce opponent’s life to 0 → win immediately.  
- **Time Over**: When Force pool is empty after Recycle → play one final beat.  
  - If no winner: highest life wins. Tie? → Reactive Player wins.  
- **Multiplayer Variants**:  
  - **Classic Melee**: Last player standing wins.  
  - **Stock Mode**: KO a player → gain marker; respawn at start of next turn. Most KOs wins.  
  - **Power-Up Mode**: Roll d6 each turn; land on matching space → draw and use Armory card (discard after use).  
  - **Force Power-Up**: Instead of card, gain +3 Force Gauge.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I avoid using an optional trigger?** Yes. Optional triggers may be skipped.  
- **What happens if I run out of Bases during a Clash?** Skip to Recycle Phase.  
- **Can I use multiple Overloads in one beat?** Yes, but each only once per beat.  
- **Does Armor stack?** Yes. Total Armor reduces incoming damage; consumed after first hit.  
- **Can I target anyone in multiplayer?** Attacks hit nearest opponent in range. “The Opponent” = nearest enemy, or the one you just hit for Hit/Damage triggers.  
- **What if movement is impossible?** If no legal move exists (e.g., Advance 3 but only 2 spaces), movement is ignored.  
- **Does “cannot advance” block teleport?** No — Teleport is not Advance, unless specified.  
- **Can I use [Opponent] ante on myself?** No — only opponent may use it.
