### 1. Lore & Objective
In the aftermath of the Restorationist War (1888–1894), humanity discovered a new continent—Australia—rich in resources but secretly harboring surviving Old Ones. Players take on the role of pioneers establishing ports, building railways, farming, mining, and fighting the encroaching Old Ones. The objective is to score more Victory Points (VP) than the Old Ones by developing infrastructure, defeating enemies, and completing objectives.

The game ends when all player discs pass space 53 on the Time Track or a player loses their Port. The player with the highest VP wins. If tied with the Old Ones, the Old Ones win.

### 2. Components
- **Player Pieces (per player):**  
  - 1 Port disc  
  - 20 cubes  
  - 3 discs (for Time Track)  
  - 20 Railway Tracks  
  - 7 Cattle Farms, 7 Corn Farms, 7 Sheep Farms  
  - 1 Player Board (Eastern Barracks side for standard play)

- **Shared Components:**  
  - Military Units: 10 Infantry, 5 Armoured Cars, 3 Airships, 3 Artillery, 4 Armoured Trains  
  - Old One Pieces: 1 purple Old One disc, 10 damage cubes, 35 Old One tiles (Levels 1–3), 8 Spawning Temple tiles  
  - Resources: 50 Coal, 50 Iron, 50 Gold, 7 Phosphate  
  - Cards: 36 Personality cards, 40 Old One cards, 30 Revelation cards (10 per level), 10 Solo Objective cards  
  - Other: 20 Survey tiles, 17 VP tokens, 13 Sanity tokens, 1 Combat marker, 1 Combat token, Player Aid

### 3. Setup
1. Use the **Eastern Australia** map. Each player selects a color and takes corresponding pieces.
2. Place starting resources: **2 Coal, 2 Iron, 4 Gold** in each player’s Warehouse. Place **3 Sanity tokens** on each player board.
3. Set aside 8 Old One tiles marked X or XX (for variants). Separate remaining tiles into Level 1, 2, and 3 stacks. Shuffle each and place face down.
4. Shuffle 20 Survey tiles. Place one in each hex marked with a triangle (13 total). Flip face up and orient arrow to top of board.
5. Place resources and face-down Old One tiles as indicated by Survey tiles:
   - Resources never in Coastal hexes.
   - Old Ones never in Coastal or Hill hexes.
   - If multiple Old Ones in one hex, upgrade to next level (Level 3 tiles not upgraded).
   - Remove Survey tiles after placement.
6. Form Revelation deck: Draw 5 cards from Level 3, place 5 from Level 2 on top, then 5 from Level 1 on top. Unused cards return to box.
7. Shuffle Personality cards. Reveal 5 face up in a display. Place deck to the left.
8. Shuffle Old One cards and place beside board.
9. Place purple Old One disc on space **22** of Time Track.
10. Place Military Units in stacks on board.
11. Randomly determine first player. Players place discs on Time Track per player count (last player bottom, first player top).
12. In reverse player order, place Port discs in Coastal hexes, each at least **2 hexes apart** (direct route).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Active Player:** The player with the lowest-positioned disc (top if tied) is active.
2. **Action Phase:** Take a cube from HQ, place it in an Action Box, and perform the action. Pay **1 Gold per prior cube** in that box if repeating.
3. **Time Cost:** Move disc along Time Track by action’s TP cost. If disc reaches or passes **53**, no further actions.
4. **Action Options:**
   - Build Railway  
   - Mine  
   - Recruit Help  
   - Buy Military Unit  
   - Import/Export  
   - Farm  
   - Attack  
   - Retrieve Cubes
5. **Old One Activation:** When all player discs pass the purple disc, activate Old Ones:
   - Move purple disc **1 space**.
   - If on illuminated space, draw and resolve a Revelation card.
   - If face-up, mobile Old Ones exist, draw **2 Old One cards** and resolve movement.
6. Repeat until game end.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Build Railway (2 or 3 TP):** Spend 1 Coal + 1 Iron to place 2 tracks. First must connect to Port; network must stay contiguous. Cannot build into Old One hexes. Path to new track must be Old One-free.
- **Mine (1 TP):** Take all of one resource type from a connected, Old One-free hex. If Phosphate, gain 1 extra Gold.
- **Recruit Help (1 TP):** Take 1 Personality card from display (shift and refill), or pay 1 Gold to draw 2, keep 1 (can swap with display).
- **Buy Military Unit (1 TP):** Pay Gold cost (shown on board). Can buy 1 unit (or 1–2 Infantry for 1 Gold each).
- **Import/Export (1 TP):** Perform 2 sub-actions:  
  - Import: Take 1 Coal/Iron from supply.  
  - Export: Return 1 Coal/Iron for 1 Gold.
- **Farm (1 TP per farm):** Place up to 1 of each type (Cattle → Hills, Corn → Coastal, Sheep → Outback). Hex must be empty (except track), connected, and Old One-free. Gain 1 Gold per farm.
- **Attack (1–3 TP):**  
  - Move units from Barracks to Expeditionary Force.  
  - Select hex within range: determined by lowest off-rail range of units (Infantry/Artillery: 1; Armoured Cars: 2; Airships: 4; Armoured Trains: only on rail).  
  - TP cost = number of different types among **Infantry, Armoured Cars, Artillery** (min 1). Trains and Airships don’t increase cost.  
  - Flip face-down Old One if present. May withdraw before combat.
- **Retrieve Cubes (1 TP, or 2 if HQ empty):** Return all cubes from action boxes to HQ.

**Combat Resolution:**
- Start with 3 Sanity tokens.
- Flip top Old One card. Resolve simultaneously:
  - **Left symbols:** If matching unit type in force, inflict 1 damage per symbol on Old One (use player cubes).
  - **Right symbols:** Damage to player:
    - Purple cube → place on unit stack (not Airships). If damage = unit’s shield, eliminate top unit.
    - Airship symbol → damage Airships.
    - Sanity symbol → lose 1 Sanity. Defeat if none left.
- After each card, choose to:
  - **Press attack** (draw next card)
  - **Withdraw** (remove damage, return units to Barracks)
  - Combat ends if Old One destroyed or player defeated.
- **Destroying Old One:** Damage ≥ shield value. If solo damage, claim tile. If shared, split VP tokens equally; remainder to highest damager.
- **Defeat:** No units left or required Sanity loss with 0 remaining. Eliminate damaged units; rest return to Barracks.
- **Port Defense:** All units fight automatically. No TP cost, no withdrawal. Lose Port and game ends if Old Ones survive.

**Old One Movement:**
- Draw 2 Old One cards per activation.
- For each card, move circled Old One types **1 hex** toward closest Port or un-blighted Farm.
- Resolve movement direction via compass if equidistant.
- If enters Farm hex, flip to blighted side. If enters Port, combat after all movement.
- Temples do not move.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Game ends when:**
- All discs (including Old One) reach or pass **53**.
- A player loses their Port.

**Player Scoring:**
- 2 VP per **non-blighted Farm**
- 3 VP per **Phosphate**
- VP from **claimed Old One tiles**
- VP from **shared kills** (tokens)
- Bonuses from **Personality cards** (e.g., +1 VP per non-blighted Sheep Farm)

**Old One Scoring:**
- 1 VP per **blighted Farm**
- Face value per **revealed Old One tile** on board
- 2× face value per **unrevealed Old One tile** on board

**Winning:** Highest score wins. Old Ones win ties. If players tie among themselves, they share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Multiple Old Ones in Hex:** Fight all. Use same card for each. Damage multiplies (e.g., 2 Zombies each deal 1 damage = 2 total damage to you).
- **Zombie Regeneration:** Remove all damage from Zombies if you withdraw.
- **Airships:** Can move through Old One hexes. Cannot take purple damage cubes.
- **Revelation Cards:** "Reveal and draw 6 movement" affects only the newly revealed Old One. Still draw 2 more for general movement.
- **Solo Play:** Use Solo Objective cards. Port placement randomized via bag draw. Gain XP cubes for achievements. Victory determined by differential (Player VP – Old One VP).
