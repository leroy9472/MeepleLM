## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
France, 1831. In the remote village of Peyrebeille, a family of greedy farmers runs an inn as a front for robbing and murdering travelers. Each player takes on the role of an innkeeper trying to amass the greatest fortune through bribery, annex construction, murder, and corpse burial.  

**Objective:** Be the richest innkeeper at the end of the game by maximizing total wealth (cash on the Wealth Track + value of 10F Checks).  

### 2. Components

  - 70 Traveler cards (Merchants/blue, Artisans/red, Police/grey, Religious/purple, Nobles/green), ranked 0–3

- **Player Setup:**  
  - Each player chooses a color and receives:  
    - 8 Key / Room Service tokens  
    - 1 wooden disc (placed on 5F of the Wealth Track)  
    - 1 Player Aid card (acts as a Barn annex)  
    - 2 Peasant cards (starting hand)  
    - 1 10F Check tile  
  - Unused Peasant and Player Aid cards return to the box.  

- **Room Setup:**

    - 4 in 4-player games  

- **First Player:** The player with the most coins in their pockets takes the First Player card.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **two seasons** (two passes through the Entrance Stack). Each round has three phases:  

#### Phase 1: Welcome Travelers (Evening)  
- The First Player draws the top card from the Entrance Stack.  
- Places it in any **open** (has a Key token) and **unoccupied** (no guest) room.  
- Repeats until all open rooms are filled.  

- **Deck Management:**  
  - When the Entrance Stack empties **for the first time**, shuffle the Exit Stack to form a new Entrance Stack.  
  - When it empties **for the second time**, play the current round to completion—then end the game.  
  - Exception: If fewer travelers are available than players, the game ends immediately (skip final round).  

#### Phase 2: Player Actions (Night)  
Starting with the First Player and proceeding clockwise, each player performs **two actions** (can repeat the same action).  

On your turn, choose one of the following:  

1. **Bribe a Guest**  
   - Select a Traveler in any room OR 1–2 Peasants from the Bistro.  
   - Play from hand a number of cards equal to the target’s rank (0–3).  
   - Return to hand any played cards with the **bribe icon (💰)**.  
   - Peasants return to the Bistro; others go to the Exit Stack.  
   - Add the bribed guest(s) to your hand.  

2. **Build an Annex**  
   - Select a Traveler card from your hand that has an annex icon (not Police or Peasants).  
   - Play from hand a number of other cards equal to the card’s rank.  
   - Return to hand any played cards with the **build icon (🛠️)**.  
   - Peasants go to the Bistro; others to the Exit Stack.  
   - Place the selected card face-up in front of you as an annex.  
   - Annexes provide special abilities and burial capacity equal to their rank.  

3. **Kill a Guest**  
   - Select a Traveler in any room or a Peasant from the Bistro.  
   - Play from hand a number of cards equal to the target’s rank.  
   - Return to hand any played cards with the **kill icon (🔫)**.  
   - Peasants go to the Bistro; others to the Exit Stack.  
   - Place the killed guest face-down in front of you as a **corpse**.  

4. **Bury a Corpse**  
   - Select a corpse in front of you.  
   - Play from hand a number of cards equal to the corpse’s rank.  
   - Return to hand any played cards with the **bury icon (⚰️)**.  
   - Peasants go to the Bistro; others to the Exit Stack.  
   - Place the corpse under any annex (yours or an opponent’s) that has space (max = annex rank).  
   - **Money:** Split the corpse’s money equally with the annex owner (you get all if it’s your annex).  
   - Cannot exceed 40F on the Wealth Track.  

5. **Pass (and Launder Money)**  
   - Take no action.  
   - Optionally:  
     - Exchange 10F on the Wealth Track for a 10F Check  
     - Exchange a 10F Check to gain 10F on the Wealth Track  

#### Phase 3: End of Round (Morning)  
**A. Police Investigation**  
- If any Police card is in a room:  
  - Each player pays **10F per unburied corpse** (cash or Checks).  
  - Unpaid amount? Pay what you can.  
  - Discard all unburied corpses to the box.  

**B. Travelers Leave**  
- Each player gains **1F per room of their color** currently occupied.  
- Move all Traveler cards from rooms to the Exit Stack (face-up, living side).  

**C. Pay Wages**  
- Pay **1F per card in hand** (accomplices).  
- Payment must be in cash (Checks not accepted).  
- If at 0F and cannot pay: discard unpaid cards to Exit Stack (Peasants to Bistro).  

**D. Pass First Player Card**  
- Move the First Player card to the left.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Action Cost:** All actions (except Pass) require discarding a number of cards equal to the **rank** of the target card.  
- **Icon Return:** Cards with the matching action icon return to hand; others are discarded (Peasants go to Bistro).  
- **Annex Capacity:** Each annex holds up to **its rank** in corpses. The Player Aid Barn is a rank-1 annex.  
- **Wealth Cap:** Maximum 40F on the Wealth Track. Excess is lost.  
- **Corpse Sharing:** Corpses can be buried under any player’s annex; money is split.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when the Entrance Stack is emptied **for the second time**, provided there are at least as many travelers as players. Otherwise, the game ends immediately.  

**Final Round Execution:** Complete all phases normally.  

**Final Scoring Steps:**  
1. **Police Investigation (forced):**  
   - Pay 10F per unburied corpse (as in normal rounds). Discard corpses.  
2. **Evaluate Rank-3 Annexes:**  
   - Activate end-game scoring abilities of rank-3 annexes.  
   - Cannot exceed 40F on the Wealth Track.  
3. **Total Wealth:**  
   - Add value of 10F Checks to Wealth Track position.  
   - Highest total wins.  

**Tiebreaker:**  
- Player with the most **corpses buried under their own annexes** wins.  
- If still tied, the game is a draw.
