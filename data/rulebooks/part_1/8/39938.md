### 4. Gameplay Flow (Per Turn)  
Each of the 4 turns consists of 4 phases:

#### A. Choose Personality  
- All 7 personality cards are available  
- Players choose one in current turn order  
- Resolve immediate effects of chosen personality  
- Reorder turn order: players are placed on upper turn order track in ascending order by red number on their personality card  

#### B. Cowboy Placement  
On your turn, choose one:  
- Place a cowboy:  
  - On an action square  
  - On an unowned parcel to buy it  
  - On an opponent’s building to attack  
  - On your building to defend  
- Or Pass:  
  - Move your marker to the first free space on the lower turn order track  
  - You may not place more cowboys this turn  
- Players continue in turn order until all have passed  

#### C. Resolve Actions and Duels  
- Resolve actions in fixed order (snake pattern across action track)  
- For each action:  
  - If only one cowboy: player performs action  
  - If multiple cowboys: duel occurs (see below)  
- After resolution:  
  - Winner’s cowboy returns to general reserve  
  - Loser(s) return cowboy(s) to personal reserve  

**Duel Rules:**  
- Each player rolls one die  
- Add:  
  - Die roll  
  - Number of cowboys in personal reserve  
  - Number of revolvers (from ranches, mines, prisons, revolver tiles)  
- Highest total wins  
- Tie: player with lowest position on turn order track wins  
- Winner performs action; loser gets nothing  

#### D. End of Turn  
- Move turn counter left (blocks one VP purchase square permanently)  
- Each player gains cowboys:  
  - End of Turn 1: +4  
  - End of Turns 2 & 3: +5  
  - Max 10 cowboys in personal reserve  
- Adjust cash:  
  - Any money over personality’s cash limit must be spent  
  - Receive 1 VP per $10 spent this way (round down)  
- Shift unsold buildings left to lower prices

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I attack a church or prison?** No. These cannot be attacked.  
- **Can I build on a mountain?** No. Mountains block building and house placement.  
- **Can I build a house on an unowned parcel?** Yes, if required for construction and parcel is road-connected.  
- **Does a house on an unowned parcel benefit all players?** Yes, for income calculations (unless adjacent to church).  
- **Can I save a building and build later?** Yes. Keep in front of you; must build by end of next Building Construction phase.  
- **What happens to the "3 guns" chip?** Returned to board at end of turn.  
- **Can I place multiple cowboys on "Wages" or "1 Road"?** Yes. No duels; each cowboy counts.  
- **Can I use sheriff cowboy to attack?** No. It must be placed on a cowboy-free square and only for claiming actions.  
- **Do I have to spend all over-limit cash?** Yes, but only get 1 VP per $10 spent (can spend more, but no extra VP).  
- **Can roads cross diagonally?** No. Roads must connect orthogonally.  
- **Can a ranch be built without road access?** Yes. No road or house required.  
- **Can I place a cowboy on a parcel with a mountain?** Yes. Mountain only affects income and placement, not ownership.
