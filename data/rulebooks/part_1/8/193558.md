Players take on the role of heroes completing 12 legendary tasks: building 3 Shrines, raising 3 Statues of different colors, making 3 Offerings of different colors, and defeating 3 Monsters of different colors. The first player to complete all tasks and return to Zeus wins. Players use Oracle Dice, consult the Oracle, and gain divine aid from gods and companions to succeed.

   - Determine starting player (clockwise order); starting player gets 3 Favor Tokens, each next player gets 1 more.
   - Distribute Ship Tiles:
     - Randomly: each player takes one.
     - Draft: reveal (number of players +1) tiles; last player chooses first, then counterclockwise.
   - Last player places Titan's Die on their oracle.

   - Place Shrines on marked spaces.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds in clockwise order. Each turn has 3 phases:

**Phase 1: Check Injury Cards**
- **3+ of same color or 6+ total**: Discard 3 Injury Cards of your choice; end turn (do not Consult the Oracle).
- **0 Injury Cards**: Take 1 Favor Token **or** advance 1 God by 1 step.
- **Otherwise**: Proceed to Phase 2.

**Phase 2: Perform Actions**
- **Recolor Dice**: Spend 1 Favor Token per step to move a die clockwise (or counterclockwise, if ability allows) around the oracle.
- **Use Actions**: Use up to 3 Oracle Dice and 1 Oracle Card (max per turn) to perform actions in any order. Used dice go to Pythia (center).
- **God Special Actions**: If any God is on the topmost row, use its ability **once per turn**. After use, return God to the lowest row **or** to the player-count row if Ship Tile ability applies. Alternatively, return the God to lowest row to draw 1 Oracle Card.
- Actions must be completed before starting another.

**Phase 3: Consult the Oracle**
- Roll all 3 Oracle Dice; place on matching symbols.
- Announce colors. All other players may advance **one** God (not on lowest row) matching any announced color by 1 step.
- Last player rolls Titan's Die with their Oracle Dice:
  - **Titan = 6**: All players draw 2 Injury Cards.
  - **Titan < 6**: Each player compares Shield strength to Titan's roll. If Shield < roll, draw 1 Injury Card.
- Turn order remains fixed.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Oracle Dice & Recoloring**
- Dice determine action colors.
- Recolor by moving die clockwise (1 Favor Token per step); some abilities allow counterclockwise recoloring or reduce cost.
- Oracle Cards act as colored dice; 1 per turn; place horizontally to mark use; discard at turn end.

**Movement**
- Use die to move Ship up to 3 water spaces; end on space matching die color.
- Pay 1 Favor Token per additional space.
- Cannot cross or stop on islands or shallows (unless ability allows).
- Multiple Ships can occupy same space.

**Fighting a Monster**
- Ship must be adjacent to Monster.
- Monster strength = 9 – Shield strength.
- Roll Battle Die (0–9):
  - Roll ≥ strength: defeat Monster; take Equipment Card reward; discard Zeus Tile; place Monster on board.
  - Roll < strength: lose round. If roll = 0, draw 1 Injury Card.
  - Pay 1 Favor Token to continue: reduce Monster strength by 1, reroll.
  - Surrender at any time; no penalty. Monster resets next fight.

**Exploring an Island**
- Ship adjacent to face-down Island Tile.
- Die color must match island hex color.

    - Β: Draw 2 Oracle Cards
    - Γ: Advance 1 or more Gods by total of 3 steps
    - Δ: Discard all Injury Cards of one color and increase Shield by 1
- If another player reveals your Shrine tile, place a Shrine on your Zeus Tile as reminder.
