### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Elder Sign*, players take on the role of Investigators attempting to prevent an Ancient One from awakening and destroying the world. The primary objective is to collect Elder Signs by successfully completing Adventures. If the Doom track fills before enough Elder Signs are collected, the Ancient One awakens, and players enter a final battle to defeat it before all Investigators are devoured.

### 2. Components
- Doomsday Clock and hand
- 6 Green Dice, 1 Yellow Die, 1 Red Die
- 48 Adventure Cards, 8 Ancient One Cards, 16 Investigator Cards, 8 Other World Cards
- 8 Ally Cards, 12 Common Item Cards, 12 Unique Item Cards, 12 Spell Cards, 32 Mythos Cards
- 15 Clue Tokens, 12 Doom Tokens, 17 Elder Sign Tokens, 30 Sanity Tokens, 30 Stamina Tokens
- 16 Investigator Markers, 22 Monster Markers
- Tokens and markers for special expansions (e.g., Storm Markers, Expedition Tokens, Relics)

### 3. Setup
1. Place the Doomsday Clock at XII (midnight).
2. Choose one Ancient One card; place it face-up and note the number of Elder Signs needed and Doom track layout.
3. Shuffle and deal six Adventure cards face-up in two rows of three.
4. Shuffle Ally, Common Item, Unique Item, Spell, Other World, and Mythos decks; place them near the play area.
5. Each player draws an Investigator card, takes matching marker, starting items, Clue tokens, and Sanity/Stamina tokens.
6. Place all Investigator markers on the Museum Entrance.
7. Determine the first player randomly.
8. Draw the first Mythos card and resolve its immediate effect.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each player turn consists of three phases:
1. **Movement Phase**: Move to any Adventure, Other World, or Entrance card.
2. **Resolution Phase**:
   - If on an Adventure/Other World card, attempt to complete tasks by rolling dice and matching symbols.
   - If on the Entrance, perform one of the listed actions (First Aid, Search Lost & Found, Buy a Souvenir).
3. **Clock Phase**: Advance the clock 3 hours. If the clock reaches or passes XII, resolve "At Midnight" effects, draw a new Mythos card, and refresh "once per day" abilities.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Tasks**: Each task requires specific die results (Investigation, Lore, Peril, Terror, or split symbols). Tasks may require advancing the clock, losing Sanity/Stamina, gaining Doom, or other effects upon completion.
- **Dice Pool**: Start with 6 green dice. Items may add yellow or red dice (red die has a Wildcard face usable as Lore, Peril, Terror, or 4 Investigation).
- **Completing Tasks**: Only one task may be completed per roll. Assign matching dice to the task. Repeat until all tasks are complete or dice are exhausted.
- **Failing a Roll**: Discard one die and reroll the rest. If a Terror result is rolled and the task fails, resolve Terror effects from the card and Mythos card.
- **Clue Tokens**: Spend to reroll any number of dice.
- **Focusing/Assisting**: After a failed roll, focus one die on your investigator or have another investigator assist (place die on their marker). Assisting investigator loses 1 Sanity or Stamina if the adventure is failed.
- **Locked Dice**: Certain cards lock a die of a specific color; it cannot be used until the card is resolved.
- **Monsters**: Appear via penalties, Doom track, or rewards. Placed on monster tasks or at the bottom of cards. Must be defeated like a regular task.
- **Blessed/Cursed**: Blessed adds a white die to the pool; becoming Blessed again grants a reward. Cursed adds a black die that cancels a matching die result when rolled; becoming Cursed again results in being devoured.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Elder Signs**: Gain by completing Adventures. Place tokens near the Ancient One. If the number of Elder Signs meets or exceeds the Ancient One's requirement, investigators win.
- **Doom Track**: Placing Doom tokens advances the track. When full, the Ancient One awakens.
- **Win Conditions**:
  - Collect enough Elder Signs before the Doom track fills.
  - Defeat the Ancient One in battle by removing all Doom tokens.
- **Lose Condition**: All Investigators are devoured.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Midnight Timing**: Occurs after a player's turn if the clock reaches or passes XII. Resolve all "At Midnight" effects, draw a new Mythos card, then refresh abilities.
- **Ancient One Awakening**: Discard the current Mythos card. Remove all Adventure, Other World, and Monster cards. Locked dice not freed by Mythos are permanently removed.
- **Battling the Ancient One**: Players take turns attempting the Ancient One's battle task. Each success removes one Doom token. Players cannot Focus or Assist but may use Items, Spells, and Clue tokens. The Ancient One attacks each midnight.
- **Devoured**: Lose all items and trophies (except Elder Signs), add one Doom token, and draw a new Investigator. If no Investigators remain, the player is eliminated.
- **Adjustable Difficulty**: Some Ancient Ones (e.g., Atlach-Nacha, Eihort, Y'Golonac, Yibb-Tstll) have difficulty settings that modify token counts or discard requirements.
- **Special Ancient Ones**:
  - **Atlach-Nacha**: Other World cards remove Doom tokens. When it awakens, discard Tom Murphy and Eric Colt. Group chooses an Ally to discard during attacks.
  - **Eihort**: Losing a Cultist causes loss of 1 Sanity or Stamina. When it awakens, only Common Items in the deck are placed on its card. Group chooses Common Items to discard during attacks.
  - **Y'Golonac**: Spell rewards add Doom tokens. Adjustable difficulty modifies losses during attacks.
  - **Yibb-Tstll**: Cannot hold more than 2 Clue tokens. When it awakens, total Clue icons on Adventure cards to set X. Adjustable difficulty modifies starting token count.
