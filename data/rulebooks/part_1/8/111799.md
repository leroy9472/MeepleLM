## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Cuba Libre simulates the Cuban Revolution, where four factions—the Government, 26 de Julio Movement (M26), Directorio Revolucionario (DR), and the Syndicate—vie for control of Cuba. Each faction has unique victory conditions based on political support, military presence, economic dominance, or population control.

Objective:  
- **Government**: Achieve Total Support > 18 and all Cities at Active Support.  
- **26 de Julio (M26)**: Total Opposition + M26 Bases > 15.  
- **Directorio (DR)**: Controlled Population + DR Bases > 9.  
- **Syndicate**: Open Casinos > 7 and Resources > 30.  
Victory is checked during Propaganda Rounds. If no instant win occurs by the 4th Propaganda Round, the winner is determined by comparing victory margins.

2. Components

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round:

2. Determine eligible factions (based on prior actions and eligibility track).  
3. First eligible faction chooses:  
   - Execute Event  
   - Perform Op + Special Activity (SA)  
   - Perform Limited Operation (LimOp)  
   - Pass  
4. Second eligible faction chooses an adjacent option.  
5. Resolve actions.  
6. Update eligibility:  
   - If any player passed, they become first eligible next round.  
   - Otherwise, the faction that took Event or LimOp becomes first eligible.  
7. Draw next card.  
When a Propaganda card is revealed, conduct the Propaganda Round.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Control**: A faction controls a space if it has more pieces than all others combined (closed casinos do not count).  
- **Operations (Ops)**: Performed by spending Resources. Each Op has cost and effects:  
  - **Train (2–4 res)**: Place up to 4 Troops/Police in selected Cities or provinces with Government Base. Optionally build Base (replace 2 cubes) or conduct Civic Action (pay 4) in controlled space with Troops and Police.  
  - **Garrison (2–4 res total)**: Move cubes to Cities/ECs. Activate 1 Guerrilla per cube in each EC. Optional free Assault in 1 EC.  
  - **Sweep (2–4 res/space)**: Move Troops to adjacent spaces. Activate Guerrillas (1 per cube in non-forest, 1 per 2 in forest).  
  - **Assault (2–4 res/space)**: Remove 1 Active Guerrilla per Troop (1 per 2 in mountains). After Guerrillas removed, remove/close Bases. In City/EC, Police act as Troops. Claim removed Cash.  
  - **Rally (1 res/space)**: Place 1 Guerrilla or, if Base present, place up to (2×Bases + 2×Population) Guerrillas or flip all to Underground.  
  - **March (1 res/Province/City)**: Move Guerrillas to adjacent spaces. Activate if: (moved Guerrillas + cubes in destination > 3) and entering EC or supported space.  
  - **Terror (1 res/Province/City)**: Activate 1 Underground Guerrilla. In Province/City: add Terror marker, shift Support/Opposition 1 level toward faction’s goal. In un-Sabotaged EC: place Sabotage.  
  - **Construct (5 res)**: In Government/Syndicate-controlled space, place closed Casino or open a closed one.  
  - **Attack (1 res)**: Activate all Guerrillas, roll 1d6. If roll ≤ number of attacking Guerrillas, remove up to 2 enemy pieces (Bases last). On roll = 1, place 1 Guerrilla. Claim Cash.  

- **Special Activities (SA)**: Optional, may accompany certain Ops:  
  - **Transport**: Move up to 3 Troops from City/Base to any space (any Op).  
  - **Air Strike**: Remove 1 Active Guerrilla (or Base if none) in Province/EC (not City); requires Garrison, Sweep, or Assault.  
  - **Reprisal**: In Government-controlled space, add Terror, shift Opposition toward Neutral, move 1 Guerrilla to adjacent space.  
  - **Profit**: Place 1 Cash under Guerrilla in 1–2 open Casino spaces; OR close Casinos/remove Syndicate Cash for 3 Resources each.  
  - **Muscle**: Move 1–2 Police to City or 1–2 Troops to Province/EC.  
  - **Bribe**: Pay 3 Resources to remove/flip Guerrillas, remove cubes, or remove Base. Transfer removed Cash.  
  - **Infiltrate**: Replace 1 Police/Troop with M26 Guerrilla in space adjacent to M26 Underground unit.  
  - **Ambush**: Guarantee Attack success: remove 2 pieces, place 1 Underground Guerrilla.  
  - **Kidnap**: In Terror-targeted space with more M26 Guerrillas than Police: take 1d6 Resources (or Cash) from Government (City/EC) or Syndicate (Casino), then close 1 Casino.  
  - **Subvert**: Add Province’s Population value to DR Resources; set space to Neutral.  
  - **Assassinate**: In Terror-targeted space where DR > Police, remove 1 enemy piece or close Casino.  

- **Laundering**: If no SA taken, spend Cash to perform an additional LimOp (not Construct).  
- **Cash**: Can be transferred between own units in same space. When enemy with Cash is eliminated, attacker takes it.  
- **Enemy Piece Removal Order**:  
  1. Pieces may belong to different Factions.  
  2. May be underground Guerrillas.  
  3. Bases may not be removed before all that Faction’s Guerrillas/Cubes are removed.  
- **Stacking Limit**: 2 non-Casino Bases and 2 Casinos per space. No Bases in ECs.  
- **Resources**: Max 49; excess is lost.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory Check**: Conducted during each Propaganda Round.  
  - **Government**: Total Support > 18 and all Cities at Active Support.  
  - **M26**: Total Opposition + M26 Bases > 15.  
  - **DR**: Controlled Population + DR Bases > 9.  
  - **Syndicate**: Open Casinos > 7 and Resources > 30.  
- If no victory after 4th Propaganda Round, compare victory margins:  
  - Government: (Total Support – 18) + (Cities at Active Support bonus)  
  - M26: (Total Opposition + Bases) – 15  
  - DR: (Controlled Pop + Bases) – 9  
  - Syndicate: min(Open Casinos – 7, Resources – 30)  
Highest margin wins. Ties broken by Resources.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a Casino be closed without being removed?** Yes. Closed Casinos still count for control but not for Syndicate victory.  
- **When is a Base removed?** Only after all Guerrillas and Cubes of that faction are removed from the space.  
- **Can you do multiple Special Activities?** No. Only one SA per Op.  
- **Can you voluntarily return your own pieces?** Yes, at any time during your turn.  
- **What happens when Aid exceeds 15?** Aid caps at 15.  
- **Can you move pieces into a space with 3+ enemy units during March?** Yes, but if moving Guerrillas + cubes > 3 and entering EC or supported space, Guerrillas activate.  
- **Last Event before Final Propaganda**: No LimOp or SA allowed.  
- **Kidnap effect on Syndicate Casino**: Always closes 1 Casino in the space, regardless of target.
