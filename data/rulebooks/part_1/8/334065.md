## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Verne is an automated opponent in a competitive tile-placement game where players build their homes with rooms, plants, and items. The goal is to score more points than Verne by the end of the game. Verne acts according to a fixed turn sequence using dice rolls, simulating decision-making without player control.

### 2. Components  
- Two six-sided dice: one Green, one Yellow  
- Market board (for displaying available cards)  
- Discard area  
- Verne’s House: a 5x2 grid for arranging cards  
- Item tokens (furniture, pets)  
- Pot tokens  
- Verdancy and Thumbs storage  
- Room cards, plant cards, tools, nurture items  

### 3. Setup  
- Use the setup for a standard 2-player game.  
- Prepare Verne’s “house” as a 5x2 card grid, with designated spaces for:  
  - Room and plant cards  
  - Item tokens (furniture, pets)  
  - Pot tokens  
  - Verdancy and Thumbs tracking  
- Use provided printouts to mark market, discard, and resource areas.  
- Each player (including Verne) starts with:  
  - 1 random room card  
  - 1 random plant card  
- The human player takes the first turn. Players alternate turns, refilling the market after each turn.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On Verne’s turn, follow this sequence:  

1. **Roll Dice**  
   Roll both the Green and Yellow dice.

2. **Check Green Die – Market Reset?**  
   - Green Die = 1–4: Proceed to Step 3.  
   - Green Die = 5:  
     - Discard all cards in the market **without** a thumb icon.  
     - Refill the market.  
     - Restart Verne’s turn (reroll both dice).  
   - Green Die = 6:  
     - Discard **all** items and tools in the market.  
     - Refill the market.  
     - Restart Verne’s turn (reroll both dice).  

3. **Check Yellow Die – Does Verne Gain a Pot?**  
   - If Yellow Die = 3 or 6:  
     - Give Verne the highest-point pot available.  

4. **Check Yellow Die – Plant or Room?**  
   - If Verne already has 8 rooms or 8 plants, he **must** take the other type, regardless of die roll.  
   - Otherwise:  
     - Yellow Die = 1, 2, 3: Verne takes a **plant** (from top row of market)  
     - Yellow Die = 4, 5, 6: Verne takes a **room** (from bottom row of market)  

5. **Check Green Die – Select Column**  
   - Green Die = 1 → 1st column  
   - Green Die = 2 → 2nd column  
   - Green Die = 3 → 3rd column  
   - Green Die = 4 → 4th column  
   (Note: No action specified for Green Die = 5 or 6 here, as they trigger market reset earlier.)  
   - Verne takes the card (plant or room) from the selected column.  
   - He also takes any thumbs associated with that card.  

6. **Place Card and Items**  
   - Place the acquired card in Verne’s House (5x2 grid).  
   - Place any matching furniture or pet tokens in the Items area.  

7. **Convert Thumbs and Tools to Verdancy**  
   - Each **nurture item** converts to **3 verdancy**.  
   - Every **2 thumbs** convert to **1 verdancy**.  
   - Any leftover thumbs (odd number) remain in the Verdancy & Thumbs storage.  

8. **Move Matching Items to Rooms**  
   - If a room is available and an item matches its color, move the item into the room.  
   - Each room can hold **one** item.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Market Reset**: Triggered by Green Die = 5 or 6; causes discard and refill, then reroll and restart Verne’s turn.  
- **Card Acquisition**: Based on die rolls and availability; Verne takes one card per turn unless reset occurs.  
- **Resource Conversion**: Thumbs and nurture items are converted to verdancy after each successful turn.  
- **Item Placement**: Matching items can be placed in same-color rooms for scoring benefits.  
- **Cap Rule**: Verne cannot have more than 8 rooms or 8 plants; if so, he takes only the other type.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
At game end, score both players’ homes.  

**Scoring for Verne:**  
- **Plants**:  
  - Arrange plants in descending point value.  
  - Count total **pots** collected during the game.  
  - Score that many **highest-value** plants (e.g., 6 pots = score top 6 plants).  
- **Verdancy**: 1 point per 2 verdancy tokens.  
- **Pots**: Score face value of all pot tokens collected.  
- **Rooms**:  
  - For each room:  
    - If it has a **matching item**, score **2 points per plant** of that room’s color.  
    - If no matching item, score **1 point per plant** of that color.  
  - Example: 2 pink rooms (one with pink couch, one without), 3 pink plants → (2×3) + (1×3) = 9 points.  
- **Unique Furniture & Pets**: Score as in base game (points based on number of distinct types collected).  
- **Bonuses**:  
  - **Plant Decorator Bonus**: 3 points if Verne has plants of all 5 colors.  
  - **Room Decorator Bonus**: 3 points if Verne has rooms of all 5 colors.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What if the market is empty?**  
  Refill after each player’s turn; market should not be empty during Verne’s turn.  
- **What if multiple resets occur?**  
  Each time Green Die = 5 or 6, discard and refill, then reroll both dice and restart Verne’s turn.  
- **Do thumbs carry over?**  
  Yes. Unconverted thumbs (odd numbers) remain in storage for future conversion.  
- **Can Verne hold more than 8 total cards?**  
  Yes, but no more than 8 **rooms** or 8 **plants**. The 5x2 grid allows up to 10 cards.  
- **What if a card has both a thumb and an item?**  
  Verne takes both: the card and any associated thumbs and items.
