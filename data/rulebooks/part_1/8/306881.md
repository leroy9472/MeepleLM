### 1. Lore & Objective
The goal of Railroad Ink Challenge™ is to create the most efficient and connected transportation network over 7 rounds (or fewer with certain expansions). Players score points primarily by connecting Exits through continuous Networks of Railways and Highways. Additional points come from Longest Routes, Central Spaces, Special Buildings, and achieving Goals before opponents. The player with the highest score wins; ties are broken by fewest Errors, then shared.

### 2. Components
- Player Board (with 12 Exits, Central Spaces, Special Buildings: Factory, Village, University)
- Dry-erase marker
- Route Dice (4 white dice showing road/rail patterns)
- Goal Cards (Basic and Expansion-specific)
- (Optional) Expansion Dice and components (e.g., Meteor, Lava, Underground dice)
- (Optional) Blueprint Cards

### 3. Setup
1. Each player takes one Board and a marker.
2. Place the white Route dice in the center.
3. Shuffle Basic Goal cards and draw 3 randomly. Place them in the center and mark their codes on your board’s Goal spaces.
4. If using an Expansion:
   - Add its dice to the center.
   - Replace one Basic Goal card with a random Expansion Goal card.

*Optional: Play without Goals by skipping step 3 and ignoring Goal scoring.*

### 4. Gameplay Flow
A game lasts 7 rounds unless modified by an expansion. Each round proceeds as follows:
1. **Roll Dice**: Roll the Route dice (and Expansion dice if applicable) and display results.
2. **Draw Routes**: All players simultaneously draw the 4 Route die results on their boards, following placement rules.
3. **Use Special Routes (Optional)**: Use one of the 3 available Special Routes (top of board), marking it off after use.
4. **Activate Special Buildings**: Trigger effects immediately if Routes are drawn on Factory, Village, or University spaces.
5. **Check Goals**: Declare and score any achieved Goals.
6. **Mark Round**: Write the round number in white boxes of all newly drawn spaces.
7. **Next Round**: Roll dice again for the next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Drawing Rules**:
  - Each Route must connect to an Exit or preexisting Route.
  - All 4 die results must be drawn if possible.
  - Railways and Highways cannot directly connect without a Station.
  - Routes may be rotated or reversed.
- **Special Routes**:
  - 3 available per game, 1 per round.
  - Each can be used only once.
  - Using a third University grants one additional free Special Route.
- **Special Buildings**:
  - **Factory**: Activate by drawing a Route (Rail or Highway). Duplicate one die result this round.
  - **Village**: Activate by drawing a Station. Mark the leftmost unmarked Village space; final score = value of highest marked space.
  - **University**: Activate by drawing a Route (Rail or Highway). Mark one University space. When third is marked, gain one free Special Route (still mark it as used).
- **Goal Scoring**:
  - After drawing, players declare achieved Goals.
  - Score the highest remaining value for that Goal.
  - Mark the scored value on the Goal card (reducing future rewards).
  - Multiple players can score the same Goal in the same round.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends after round 7. Final scoring:
1. **Connected Exits**: For each Network (group of connected Exits), score points based on number of Exits using the Network Values track.
2. **Longest Highway**: Score 1 point per space in the longest continuous Highway path (can cross itself; Stations don’t break it).
3. **Longest Railway**: Same as Highway, for Railways.
4. **Central Spaces**: 1 point per Central Space (9-center) with any drawing.
5. **Villages**: Score value of highest marked Village space.
6. **Goals**: Sum all points from achieved Goals.
7. **Errors**: Each unconnected Route end (not on Exit or board edge) = −1 point. Mark with X.
8. **Expansion Points**: Add any expansion-specific points in designated space.

Total = Sum of all above. Most points wins. Tiebreak: fewest Errors, then shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I skip a die result?** No, unless using an Expansion that makes die usage optional.
- **Can I use a Special Route after activating University?** Yes, even the free one counts as using a Special Route (mark it off), but doesn’t count toward the 1-per-round limit.
- **Do duplicated dice trigger Special Buildings again?** Yes, if drawn on a Special Building space.
- **Can I connect through a wall (Blueprint)?** No. Walls block connections; Routes on either side are not connected.
- **What if I can’t connect a Route?** You cannot draw it.
- **Can I use multiple Special Routes in one round?** No, maximum one per round.
