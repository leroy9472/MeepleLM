## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
These mini-expansions for *Photosynthesis* introduce dynamic seasonal effects and strategic Event Cards to increase variety and replayability. The core objective remains unchanged from the base game: earn the most Victory Points (VP) by growing, harvesting, and strategically positioning trees on the forest board. The expansions add variability through seasonal mechanics and one-time or persistent effects via Event Cards.

Players may use either or both expansions with the base game. A six-sided die (D6) is required for certain card effects.

> **Note**: If a player runs out of trees or cannot collect light due to lack of options, they may place 2 small trees anywhere on the board as a last resort.

### 2. Components  
The mini-expansions include:
- **Season Cards**:
  - 4 Season Choice Cards (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)
  - 4 Season Decks (one per season), each containing multiple cards
- **Event Cards**:
  - A deck of Event Cards with various effects and play conditions
- One D6 (six-sided die)

These are used in addition to all components from the base *Photosynthesis* game.

### 3. Setup  

#### The Four Seasons
1. **Determine Starting Season**:
   - Shuffle the 4 Season Choice Cards face down.
   - Draw one randomly to determine the starting season. The seasonal order remains fixed: Spring → Summer → Autumn → Winter (cycling back if needed).
2. **Prepare Season Cards**:
   - Shuffle each of the four Season Decks separately.
   - Draw one card from each deck and place them face down in a pile next to the Sun’s starting position.
   - Since a standard game lasts 3 full sun revolutions (i.e., 3 full cycles of seasons), set aside the Season Card that corresponds to the unused season (e.g., if starting in Spring and playing 3 cycles, remove one Winter card).
3. **Reveal First Season Card**:
   - After players place their initial trees during the first Life Cycle Phase, reveal the top Season Card before the Photosynthesis Phase begins.

#### Event Cards
1. Shuffle the Event Card Deck.
2. Place it face down next to the game board.

Each player may spend 2 Light Points during their turn to draw 1 Event Card into their hand.  
Players may hold multiple cards but can only play one Event Card **between their turns** (i.e., not more than one per full round).

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game follows the base *Photosynthesis* structure per round:  
1. **Life Cycle Phase** – Players take actions (buy/grow trees, plant seeds, harvest).
2. **Photosynthesis Phase** – Sun moves, light is collected based on shadows.

With expansions:

#### The Four Seasons
- At the end of each full Sun revolution (i.e., completion of a season), begin a new season.
- Before the first player takes their turn in the new season, reveal the next Season Card from the pile.
- The effect on the Season Card activates according to its specified timing and duration.

#### Event Cards
- During a player’s turn, they may spend 2 Light Points to draw 1 Event Card.
- Cards specify **when** they can be played (e.g., "Anytime", "Before Photosynthesis Phase").
- Only **one Event Card** may be played between a player’s consecutive turns.
- Played Event Cards remain beside the player’s mat for ongoing effects.
- Unplayed cards stay in hand.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Season Card Effects (by Season)

**Spring**
- *Nursery*: At start of season, take a seed from player mat for free and place it on the board. Start with the first player.
- *Good Nutrients*: Activate two spots twice this season (costs still apply). Use discarded tokens to track.
- *Greenhouse*: On each turn, beginning before your action, choose to place a small tree here. Roll D6 for each tree:
  - 1: Discard tree
  - 2–4: Keep on card
  - 5–6: Replace with medium tree in active area; return small tree to mat
  - At season end, return all remaining trees to mats.
- *Hungry Birds*: At start of season, every player discards one seed (from board → active area → mat if needed). Repeat in turns 3 and 5 **only if** a D6 roll is 1–2.
- *Light Collector*: Small trees gain +1 Light Point permanently this season.

**Summer**
- *Planned Bushfire*: After light collection in turn 3, downgrade all trees once (large → medium, medium → small, small → active area). Seeds remain. If no trees, player may plant 2 small trees for free on outer ring.
- *Drought*: Before each new round, roll D6. On 1, no player can plant seeds or grow seeds into small trees this round.
- *Grown Tall*: Large trees always collect light, regardless of shadow.
- *High UV Rays*: Gain +1 Light Point per turn.
- *Tree Sale*: Buying any tree costs 1 less Light Point.

**Autumn**
- *Disease*: At start of season, if 4+ adjacent trees of same color exist, remove all to owners’ active areas.
- *Early Harvest*: All large trees are harvested for free. Return to owners’ player mats.
- *Blustery Days*: On last turn of Autumn, all trees collect 1 fewer Light Point.
- *Breeze*: Seeds may be planted one space further than normal.
- *Winter Is Coming*: Growing a seed into a small tree costs +1 Light Point.

**Winter**
- *Glasshouse*: At start of season, players may place any number of small trees on this card (buying if needed). On each of their turns:
  - Roll D6 per tree:
    - 1: Remove to player mat
    - 2–6: Stay on card
  - At season end: For each tree still on card, gain 6 Light Points and place small tree in active area.
- *Santa Claus*: At start of season, remove all small trees to owners’ mats. Gain 1 Light Point per tree removed; gain 2 per tree if it had to be discarded (i.e., no space on mat).
- *Crippled Trees*: When scoring a tree, take VP token from **bottom** of stack instead of top.
- *Hard to Get a Grip*: Planting a tree costs +1 Light Point.
- *Holy Trees*: Pay 3 instead of 4 Light Points to score a tree.

#### Event Cards (Selected Highlights)
- *Bonsai*: Discard at end of game to gain +4 Light Points. Worth 2 VP if held in hand at game end.
- *Onodrim*: Move a medium tree to an adjacent empty space.
- *Lumberjack*: Remove one small tree to its owner’s active area.
- *Collector*: Gain 1 VP per 2 unused Light Points at game end (permanent).
- *Dominant Species*: Take your turn before the first player (play after collecting light).
- *Déjà vécu*: Skip turning the Sun this phase; skip the next position on future rotation.
- *Hiker*: Remove two seeds to their owners’ active areas.
- *New Nursery*: Can have 5 small trees on mat; 5th costs 1 Light Point (permanent).
- *Tree Spirits*: Place a discarded seed or tree back into your active area.
- *Eclipse*: No player collects Light Points this turn.
- *Heliocentric Theory*: Rotate the board instead of moving the Sun.
- *Storm*: Remove any tree with no adjacent trees (i.e., isolated) to owner’s active area.
- *Pinnacle*: All trees (including shaded) collect Light Points this turn.
- *Tree House*: Mark a tree; it collects 1 fewer Light Point until removed.
- *Sunrise*: Trees cast shadows one space further this turn.
- *Photosynthesis*: Can store up to 32 Light Points (base limit is 20).
- *Natural Monument*: When scoring a tree, take the **bottom** VP token from the **next higher level**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I play more than one Event Card per round?**  
A: No. Only **one Event Card** may be played between a player’s turns (i.e., once per full round).

**Q: What happens if multiple Season Cards have ongoing effects?**  
A: All active effects persist until their duration ends. Stack effects as needed (e.g., +1 from *High UV Rays* and +1 from *Light Collector*).

**Q: Can I use *Greenhouse* or *Glasshouse* if I have no small trees?**  
A: Yes. You may purchase small trees with Light Points and immediately place them on the card.

**Q: How does *Déjà vécu* interact with Sun rotation?**  
A: When played, skip turning the Sun this phase. Then, on the next full rotation, skip the next Sun position (i.e., jump two spots total over two phases).

**Q: What if a player has no seeds for *Hungry Birds*?**  
A: They discard from active area. If none there, from player mat.

**Q: Can *Onodrim* move a medium tree to any adjacent spot?**  
A: Yes, to any adjacent empty space, following normal placement rules (no diagonals).

**Q: Does *Storm* remove seeds?**  
A: No. Only **trees** (small, medium, large) with no adjacent trees are removed.

**Q: Does *Santa Claus* trigger if a player has no small trees?**  
A: No effect for that player, but others still gain points for their trees.
