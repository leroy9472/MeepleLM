## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Formula D is a racing board game simulating high-speed Formula-style races on detailed tracks. Players control cars navigating straights, corners, and pit stops while managing wear points (WP) across multiple systems. The objective is to be the first car to cross the finish line after completing the required number of laps (typically 2 or 3).

### 2. Components  
- Game board (circuit track)  
- Player cars  
- Dashboard and gear stick for each player  
- Driver cards with assigned Wear Points (WP)  
- Dice: d4, d6, d8, d12, d20 (black event die), d30  
- Wear Point markers (Tire, Brake, Engine, Gearbox, Body, Road Handling)  
- Damage markers

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose a circuit. Each player selects a car, dashboard, gear stick, and driver card.  
2. Set gearshift marker to 1st gear. Mark starting WPs per driver card.  
3. Determine starting order:  
   - Roll black d20. Highest roll gets pole position; others follow in descending order. Re-roll ties.  
4. Before first move, roll black die for start:  
   - **1**: Engine stall — miss first turn, restart in 1st gear next round.  
   - **2–19**: Normal start — roll 1st gear die normally.  
   - **20**: Excellent start — move 4 spaces immediately (can change 1–2 lanes). May shift to 2nd gear next turn.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in this order:

#### 1. Determine Turn Order  
- Ordered by track position: leader goes first.  
- Ties broken by:  
  a) Higher gear  
  b) Closer to inside lane (relative to next corner)

#### 2. Select Gear  
- Must shift one gear at a time when upshifting.  
- Downshifting allows skipping 1–3 gears, but costs WP:  
  | Gears Skipped | Brake WP | Engine WP | Gearbox WP |  
  |---------------|---------|----------|------------|  
  | 1             | 1       | 1        | 1          |  
  | 2             | 2       | 2        | 2          |  
  | 3             | 3       | 3        | 3          |  

#### 3. Roll Gear Die  
Use die corresponding to selected gear:  
- 1st: d4 (1–2)  
- 2nd: d6 (2–4)  
- 3rd: d8 (4–8)  
- 4th: d12 (7–12)  
- 5th: d20 (11–20)  
- 6th: d30 (21–30)  

If rolling **20 in 5th** or **30 in 6th**, all cars in 5th/6th gear must roll black die:  
- **1–4**: Lose 1 Engine WP.  
- 0 Engine WP → Eliminated.

#### 4. Move Car  
Move exact number rolled. May spend Brake WP to reduce movement:  
- Lose 1 Brake WP per space not advanced.  
- If blocked by another car, move as far as possible, then lose Brake and Tire WP equal to uncompleted spaces.  
- Insufficient WP to stop → Eliminated.

#### 5. End-of-Move Checks  
Check for:  
- Overshooting corners  
- Slipstreaming  
- Collisions  
- Entering pits

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Driving Corners  
- Yellow circle = required number of stops.  
- Green box = longest path length. Red box = shortest.  
- Must stop minimum number of times **within** corner.  
- On exit:  
  - Cannot change lanes.  
  - If move ends in another corner, previous stop does not count.  

#### Overshooting a Corner  
- Each space beyond corner exit: lose 1 Tire WP.  
- If last Tire WP lost:  
  - Car spins out — place backward on final space.  
  - Next turn: turn around, start in 1st gear.  
- If overshoot by:  
  - **1 space with 0 Tire WP** → Spin out again.  
  - **2+ spaces with 0 Tire WP** → Eliminated.  
- Skipping more than 1 required stop → Eliminated.  

#### Braking  
- Spend 1 Brake WP per space not moved.  
- Hard Braking (when blocked):  
  - Lose Brake and Tire WP equal to unused movement.  
  - Not enough WP? → Eliminated.  

#### Slipstreaming  
Conditions:  
- End move directly behind another car **without braking**.  
- Both cars in **4th gear or higher**.  
- Rear car in **same or higher gear** than front.  

Effect:  
- Move additional 3 spaces (can include lane changes). Options:  
  a) Change lane, overtake, return to original lane.  
  b) Change one lane, move 2 spaces straight.  
  c) Change two lanes, move 1 space.  
- May use Brake WP to reduce slipstream distance.  
- Can chain slipstreams if ending behind another car.  
- If slipstream carries into corner: lose 1 Brake WP (movement not reduced).  

#### Collisions  
Triggered when a car ends adjacent to or behind another.  
- Each involved driver rolls black d20 for **each nearby car**:  
  - **1** = Lose 1 Body WP.  
- 0 Body WP → Eliminated.  
- Place damage marker where collision occurred.  

#### Damage Markers  
Placed when:  
- Car loses Body or Engine WP  
- Car is eliminated  

Effect on subsequent cars:  
- Passing over or landing on marker → roll black d20:  
  - **1–4** = Lose 1 Road Handling WP  
  - 0 Road Handling WP → Eliminated  

#### Pit Stops  
- Enter at any speed; no need to roll exact number.  
- Upon entry: regain **all Tire WP**.  
- Roll black d20:  
  - **1–10 (Quick Stop)**: Move ⌈roll/2⌉ spaces in 4th gear.  
  - **11–20 (Slow Stop)**: Stay in pit; move in 4th or lower gear next turn.  
- Cars must wait for car ahead in pit lane to exit before moving.  
- Optional: Technical Pit Stop allows regaining up to 2 WP in non-tire categories.  

#### Elimination Conditions  
A car is eliminated if:  
- Loses final point in **Engine**, **Body**, **Road Handling**, or **Tire WP** via overshot corner by 2+ spaces  
- Loses more Tire WP than available in a single overshoot  
- Skips more than 1 required corner stop

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Winner: First car to cross finish line after completing required laps (usually 2 or 3).  
- Race continues until all cars finish.  
- Optional scoring (Team Race):  
  | Finish Position | Points |  
  |------------------|--------|  
  | 1st              | 10     |  
  | 2nd              | 6      |  
  | 3rd              | 4      |  
  | 4th              | 3      |  
  | 5th              | 2      |  
  | 6th              | 1      |  
- Team with highest total wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I zigzag on straights?**  
A: Only when overtaking. Cannot return to original lane in same move otherwise.

**Q: Can I brake into a slipstream?**  
A: No. Must end move directly behind car **without braking**.

**Q: What happens if I enter a corner via slipstream?**  
A: Lose 1 Brake WP. Movement is not reduced.

**Q: Can I skip 4 gears down?**  
A: No. Maximum of 3 gears skipped when downshifting.

**Q: Does starting in pit lane count as a pit stop?**  
A: No. Pit stop effects only apply during race.

**Q: Can I use nitro in any gear?**  
A: Yes. All cars have nitro (once per lap): bonus = gear number (e.g., +3 in 3rd). Place damage marker after use.

**Q: What happens if I roll a 20 on 5th gear but am in 4th?**  
A: Only cars in 5th or 6th gear must check for engine damage.
