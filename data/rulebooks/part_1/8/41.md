## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Can't Stop is a push-your-luck dice game designed by Sid Sackson. In the standard multiplayer version, the goal is to be the first player to claim three columns by reaching their top with your markers. In the solitaire variant, the objective shifts to completing all eleven columns in as few turns as possible.

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board with eleven numbered columns (2 through 12)  
- 3 temporary markers ("climbers" or "white cones")  
- 4 standard six-sided dice  
- 44 colored markers (11 per color, for up to 4 players) — in solitaire, only one color is used  
- Turn record sheet (optional, for tracking progress)

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose one color for your permanent markers.  
2. Place all 11 of your colored markers aside for later use.  
3. Place the 3 temporary markers off the board.  
4. Determine turn order if playing multiplayer; in solitaire, begin immediately.  
5. (Optional) Use a turn record sheet to log progress.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn:  
1. **Roll** all 4 dice.  
2. **Split** the dice into two pairs of your choice. Add each pair to get two numbers (e.g., 1+5=6, 4+6=10).  
3. **Act** on both numbers:  
   - If you have a temporary marker in that column, move it up one space.  
   - If you have an unused temporary marker and the column is active, place it at the bottom (or above your permanent marker if already present).  
   - You may use both numbers to act on up to two different columns.  
4. **Optional continuation**:  
   - If you successfully placed or moved at least one marker, you may choose to roll again.  
   - On subsequent rolls, you may:  
     - Move a temporary marker in a column you're already working on.  
     - Start a new column (if you still have an unused temporary marker).  
   - You may have up to 3 active columns per turn.  
5. **Stop or Bust**:  
   - You may stop at any time before rolling. Replace all temporary markers with your permanent colored markers.  
   - If a roll does not allow you to place or move at least one temporary marker, you "bust" (or "scratch"). Remove all temporary markers from the board. No progress is saved.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Column Lengths**: Columns vary in length (e.g., 2 and 12 are shortest; 7 is longest), but middle numbers are more probable.  
- **Temporary Markers**: Represent current progress. Lost on a bust.  
- **Permanent Markers**: Placed when you stop. Represent secured progress.  
- **Winning a Column**: When your permanent marker reaches the top of a column, you claim it. Remove all temporary and opponent markers from that column. The column is closed.  
- **Solitaire Variants**:  
  - **Easy**: Complete all 11 columns in 30 or fewer turns (each turn, successful or bust, counts).  
  - **Advanced**: Same as Easy, but if you bust and had temporary progress in any partially completed column, that column’s permanent marker is removed — you must restart from the bottom. Goal: complete all columns in 40 or fewer turns.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Condition**: All eleven columns are completed (claimed).  
- **Scoring**: Total number of turns taken (including bust/scratch turns).  
- **Victory Levels (Advanced Example)**:  
  - 30 or fewer: Outstanding  
  - 31–35: Excellent  
  - 36–40: Very Good  
  - Over 40: Try again  
- **Turn Record Sheet Usage**:  
  - Record progress per turn: e.g., "4×2, 8×2, 9×1"  
  - Mark busts with "S"; for Advanced, list columns wiped: e.g., "S – 4,5"  
  - Mark completed columns with "Cap": e.g., "7 Cap"

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I stop immediately after the first roll?** Yes.  
- **Can I re-roll if I land on an opponent’s space?** Only if "Forced Move" variant is used (not in standard or solitaire).  
- **Can I place a marker in a completed column?** No — even if it's your own. Doing so causes a bust.  
- **What happens if I roll doubles or same-sum pairs (e.g., 7 and 7)?** You may move one marker two spaces in the 7 column, or split the action (e.g., move one marker up twice, or place two markers if allowed).  
- **Do I have to use both pairs?** Yes — if you can. If you cannot act on at least one, you bust.  
- **Can I skip placing a marker if I can?** No — if you can place or move a marker, you must.
