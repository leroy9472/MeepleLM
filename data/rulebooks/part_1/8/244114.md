## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Yellow & Yangtze is set during China’s Warring States period (475–221 BC), where players lead dynasties in building civilizations through tile placement and strategic conflict. The goal is to achieve the highest score by balancing victory points (VPs) across five categories. A player's score is determined by their **lowest** VP total in any of the four core colors (black, red, blue, green), with yellow VPs acting as wilds that can be allocated to boost weaker categories. The player with the highest such minimum wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board in the center.  
2. Place **one black governor tile** on each of the **seven marked capital spaces**. Put all remaining tiles into the bag and shuffle.  
3. Place all **pagodas** beside the board.  
4. Each player:  
   - Chooses a dynasty (lion, bull, archer, pot)  
   - Places their **screen** and **five leaders** in front of them  
   - Draws **6 tiles** from the bag and places them behind their screen  
5. Draw **6 tiles** from the bag and place them face-up in the **green scroll area** (market).  
6. Choose a starting player randomly. Play proceeds clockwise.  

*(Optional: For a shorter 2-player game, remove 24 random tiles from the bag before setup.)*

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, perform **two actions** in any order (same action may be taken twice):

#### A) Position (Place, Move, or Withdraw) a Leader  
- Move one of your leaders from off-board to an **empty space adjacent to a black governor tile**.  
- Leaders **cannot be placed on river spaces**.  
- You may **move** a leader from one valid space to another, or **withdraw** it back to in front of your screen.  
- **Restriction**: Cannot place a leader if it would **unite states containing like-colored leaders** (would cause a war).  
- If placing a leader into a state that already contains a **same-colored leader**, a **revolt** occurs immediately.

#### B) Place a Tile  
- Take one tile from behind your screen and place it on an **empty space**.  
- **Blue Farmer tiles** may **only be placed on river spaces**.  
- All other tiles may **only be placed on non-river spaces**.  

**Special Tile Effects**:  
- **Green Trader**: After placement, you may take **one face-up market tile** and place it behind your screen.  
- **Blue Farmer**: You may **place multiple adjacent blue tiles** in the same action, as long as:  
  - Each new tile is adjacent to the previous  
  - No tile placement triggers a conflict or pagoda placement  

**Victory Points from Tile Placement**:  
- If the tile is placed in a **state with a same-colored leader**, the leader’s owner gains **1 VP** of that color.  
- If no same-colored leader is present but a **black Governor leader** is in the state, that leader’s owner gains the point.  
- **Exception**: No VP is awarded if the tile **unites states and causes a war**.  

**Pagoda Opportunity**:  
- If placing a tile creates a **triangle of three adjacent same-colored tiles**, and:  
  - No conflict is created  
  - None of the three tiles already supports a pagoda  
  - Then you may **place a matching-color pagoda** on the triangle (does **not** use an action).  
  - Take the pagoda from beside the board if available; otherwise, relocate one from elsewhere on the board.

#### C) Discard Two Blue Farmer Tiles to Cause a Peasants’ Riot  
- Discard **two blue farmer tiles** from behind your screen (face down to box).  
- **Optional**: Your **unplaced blue Farmer leader** may count as one tile (so only one actual tile needs to be discarded).  
- Then, **remove any one tile from the board** (discard face down).  
- **Effects**:  
  - If the removed tile was the **last adjacent black governor tile** to a leader, that leader is **removed and returned** to the player.  
  - If the removed tile was **under a pagoda**, the pagoda is **removed and returned** to beside the board.

#### D) Discard Two Green Trader Tiles to Establish a Pagoda  
- Discard **two green trader tiles** from behind your screen (face down).  
- **Optional**: Your **unplaced green Trader leader** may count as one tile.  
- Then, **place a pagoda** of any color on a **triangle of three adjacent same-colored tiles** that:  
  - Was formed earlier (by anyone)  
  - Does not already support a pagoda  
- Take the pagoda from beside the board or relocate one from the board.

#### E) Replace Up to Six Tiles from Behind Your Screen  
- Discard **up to six tiles** from behind your screen (face down to box).  
- Draw the **same number** from the bag and place behind your screen.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Conflicts  
Conflicts resolve **immediately**, even before completing an action.  

**Revolt**  
- Triggered when a leader is **placed** into a state with a **same-colored leader**.  
- **Attacker**: Player placing the new leader  
- **Defender**: Player controlling the existing leader  

**Resolution**:  
1. Strength = number of **black governor tiles adjacent** to the leader + **committed black tiles** from behind screen.  
2. **Attacker commits first**, then defender.  
3. **Optional**: An **unplaced black Governor leader** adds **+1 strength** to its player’s side.  
4. **Higher strength wins**; **defender wins ties**.  
5. **Loser**: Withdraws leader to in front of screen.  
6. **Winner**: Gains **1 VP** in the color of the conflicting leaders.  
7. Both players discard **committed black tiles** (face down). Committed leader is returned.  

**War**  
- Triggered when a tile **unites two or more states**, resulting in a state with **like-colored leaders**.  
- **No VP** is awarded for the tile placement.  
- Place the **red unification marker** on the unifying tile.  

**Resolution**:  
1. Base strength of each warring state = number of **red soldier tiles** in that state.  
2. Starting with the player **to the left of the active player**, each player (in clockwise order) may:  
   - Commit **any number of red soldier tiles** from behind screen  
   - **Or** commit their **unplaced red Soldier leader** (counts as +1 strength)  
   - To **any one warring state** (even if not their own)  
3. The **active player (tile placer)** is the **last to commit**.  
4. **Highest total strength wins**; in case of a tie, **active player chooses** the winning state.  
5. **Losing states**:  
   - All **conflicting leaders** are removed and returned to owners  
   - All **red soldier tiles** are removed  
6. For **each conflicting leader removed**, the player with the **same-colored leader in the winning state** gains **1 VP** in that color.  
7. **Winning state must discard red soldier tiles equal to the strength of the strongest losing state**:  
   - First, discard **all committed red tiles** for the winning state  
   - Count **committed red Soldier leader** as part of this discard  
   - If still insufficient, **active player chooses** which red tiles to remove from the winning state  
8. Remove unification marker.  
9. All discarded red tiles go to the box (face down); committed leaders return.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game ends** when a player attempts to draw a tile but the **bag is empty**.  
- **Immediately end the turn**; do not resolve further actions or draws.  

**Final Scoring**:  
1. All players **reveal their screens**.  
2. Each player **freely allocates their yellow (wild) VPs** to any of the other four colors (black, red, blue, green).  
3. Determine the **lowest VP total** among the four core colors — this is the player’s score.  
4. **Winner**: Player with the **highest** such minimum.  
5. **Tiebreaker**: Compare **second-lowest** color totals; then third, then fourth if needed.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a leader to unite peaceful states?**  
  Yes, as long as the resulting state does **not** contain like-colored leaders.  
- **Can I cause a peasants’ riot that removes a capital tile?**  
  Yes. Capital tiles have no special protection after setup.  
- **Do yellow tiles give VPs?**  
  Yes, if a yellow Artisan leader is present (or black Governor if absent), placing a yellow tile gives a yellow VP.  
- **Can I use my unplaced leader effect more than once per game?**  
  Yes. The leader is **not discarded** — it can be used every time the condition arises.  
- **Can I establish a pagoda on a triangle that supports a different-color pagoda?**  
  No. A triangle can support **only one pagoda**, and only if **none** is currently on it.  
- **What happens if I can’t draw tiles at the end of my turn?**  
  You still score **pagoda points** before the game ends. Other players do not draw to refill if below 6.
