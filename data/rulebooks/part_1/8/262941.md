## Dominant Species: Marine — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Dominant Species: Marine is a strategic board game set in a primordial ocean environment where players control evolving marine species competing for dominance across changing ecosystems. The objective is to adapt your species, survive extinction events, and score the most Victory Points (VPs) by controlling terrain, surviving events, and maintaining position in the food chain. The game ends when the Asteroid card is drawn, followed by a final Reseed, Extinction, and Survival event.

### 3. Setup  

#### Base Setup  
1. Each player chooses a color and takes the matching player board and VP marker.  
   - Place VP marker at 0 on score track.  
   - Place 1 animal cube on the leftmost Food Chain box of player board.  
2. **Cylinder Placement (Player Count Adjustment):**  
   - 4 cylinders: 4 players  
   - 5 cylinders: 3 players  
   - 7 cylinders: 2 players  
3. Place pre-printed land tiles and food markers as indicated.  
   - Place 3 animal cubes on the central Reef tile.  
4. Place Smoker/Geyser tiles on the topmost and bottommost hex land tiles.  
5. Shuffle remaining land tiles into the Wanderlust area, forming 3 stacks of 7 tiles each, with top tiles face-up.  
6. Draw food tiles for:  
   - Abundance  
   - Adaptation  
   - Speciation  
   - Wanderlust  
7. Draw terrain markers for Competition and Evolution sections. Evolution markers are placed in printed order.  
8. Place neutral element marker and cylinder in the bottom-left corner of the board.  
9. Place smaller neutral element tile on one space of the score track.  
10. Remove the Asteroid card from the Evolution deck.  
11. Shuffle remaining Evolution cards and:  
   - Return 10 cards to the box for a regular-length game.  
   - (Optional variants: return 15 for shorter, 5 for longer, or none for epic game.)  
12. Shuffle the Asteroid card into the bottom 4 cards of the Evolution deck.  
13. Place the deck on the board and reveal 5 Evolution cards.  
14. Deal 3 trait cards to each player.  
   - Each player selects 1 trait card to keep; discard the other 2.  
15. Determine play order: player with lowest position in food chain goes first.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

On your turn, choose one of the following:  
- **Place an Action Pawn**: Place one of your available pawns on an unoccupied or eligible action space.  
  - Regular pawns must be placed on a space after (later in turn order than) any of your previously placed pawns.  
  - Special pawns may be placed on any space, including special action spaces, and can bump opponent’s regular pawns.  
- **Retrieve Your Pawns**: Slide the turn order cube forward and reclaim all your placed pawns.  

After a player retrieves pawns, the turn order advances.  

**Game Events Trigger During Play:**  
- **Extinction Event**: Triggered when a "dead fish" icon appears. All animals that cannot feed (due to mismatched food requirements) are removed from the board (dead animals are permanently removed unless otherwise stated).  
- **Survival Event**: Triggered by a "living fish" symbol. The player with the most animals on vent tiles gains bonus VPs for each vent tile they dominate (no ties allowed; if tied, no one scores).  
- **Reseed Event**: Occurs when all players have retrieved their pawns (all action pawns are on the right side of player boards). Then:  
  1. 3 vents destroy the surrounding food tile.  
  2. Perform Regression: return food tiles to supply.  
  3. Slide Adaptation track downward.  
  4. Return Depletion, Speciation, and Wanderlust elements to supply.  
  5. Slide Autotroph and Abundance tracks downward.  
  6. Redraw new food tiles for Abundance, Adaptation, Speciation, and Wanderlust.  
  7. Redraw terrain markers for Competition and Evolution (in printed order).  
  8. Reset Food Chain and Turn Order cubes.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action Spaces  
(No specific list provided in source; mechanics inferred from rules.)  
- Players use action pawns to activate abilities such as adding species, adapting traits, claiming terrain, or influencing food chains.  
- **Regular pawns**: Must follow turn order placement rules (cannot jump ahead).  
- **Special pawns**: Can go anywhere, including bumping opponent’s regular pawns off spaces.  
- Players may skip their action after placing a pawn.  

#### Food Chain & Turn Order  
- Determined by player board positions. Lower = earlier turn order.  
- Can shift during Reseed events.  

#### Traits & Evolution  
- Trait cards define species capabilities (e.g., food type, movement, defense).  
- Evolution cards drive game events and progression.  
- The Asteroid card ends the game after it is played and triggers final events.  

#### Animal Survival  
- Animals die if they cannot feed during Extinction events.  
- Dead animals are permanently removed unless a rule specifies otherwise.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Trigger  
- Game ends when the **Asteroid card is played** from the Evolution deck.  
- Play continues until the next **Reseed** event occurs.  
- Then, conduct:  
  1. Final **Extinction Event**  
  2. Final **Survival Event**  

#### Final Scoring  
Players score:  
- 1 VP for each **controlled action pawn** still on the board.  
- 1 VP for each **terrain tile** they control (most species present).  
- In case of tie on terrain tiles, **Food Chain order** breaks the tie (lower position wins).  

The player with the highest total VPs wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I skip my action after placing a pawn?**  
A: Yes. Once you place a pawn, you may choose to skip taking the associated action.

**Q: What happens to dead animals?**  
A: They are removed from the game permanently unless a specific rule states otherwise.

**Q: Can special pawns bump other special pawns?**  
A: No—only regular opponent pawns may be bumped by special pawns.

**Q: How is turn order determined?**  
A: By food chain position (lowest = first). Reset during Reseed events.

**Q: What happens if no player has majority on a vent during Survival?**  
A: No one scores bonus VPs for that vent (no ties allowed).

**Q: Are pre-printed land tiles always used?**  
A: Yes, in base setup. Alternate setup uses random tiles.
