## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Two villages, founded on the lands of a former monastery, uphold a tradition of brewing beer and baking bread. Though they share resources, a friendly rivalry persists.  

Each player represents one village. Over six alternating **fruitful** and **dry** years, players must harvest resources, produce beer and bread, sell them for coins, and upgrade facilities. Victory is determined by **balance**: after six years, a player’s score is the **lower** of their total coin earnings from beer and bread. The player with the higher such score wins.  

### 2. Components  
- **Board**: Shared central board with fields (wheat, barley, rye, hops, river), player sides (storage, bakery, brewery, upgrade slots).  
- **60 Cards**:  
  - 30 **beer cards** (worth 4–9 coins in denominations of 6–7 or 8–9)  
  - 30 **bread cards** (worth 4–5 or 6–7 or 8–9 coins)  
- **Resource Tokens (84 total)**:  
  - 18 blue **water**  
  - 18 yellow **wheat**  
  - 18 brown **barley**  
  - 15 orange **rye**  
  - 15 green **hops**  
- **1 Windmill Token**: Starting player marker.  
- **1 Year Marker**: Tracks game rounds on the calendar track.  
- **1 Scoring Pad**: For recording final scores.  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board horizontally; each player has their own side.  
2. Shuffle all 60 cards into a draw deck; place beside the board (near the lake on player B’s side). Leave space for a discard pile.  
3. Place 3 exchange card spaces beside the draw deck.  
4. Create a common supply for all 5 resource types.  
5. Place the **year marker** on the first space of the calendar track.  
6. Choose a starting player; give them the **windmill**.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **6 rounds (years)**, alternating:  
- **Fruitful Years**: Rounds 1, 3, 5  
- **Dry Years**: Rounds 2, 4, 6  

Each year has four phases:  

#### Fruitful Year Phases  
a) **Seeding Phase**  
- Wheat field → 7 wheat  
- Barley field → 8 barley  
- Rye field → 6 rye  
- Hops field → 6 hops  
- River → all 18 water tokens  

(If insufficient, add as many as possible.)  

b) **Card Phase**  
- Deal 5 cards to the player with the windmill.  
- Then deal 5 to the other player.  

c) **Action Phase**  
Repeat until all hand cards are played:  
1. Player with windmill plays one card.  
2. Other player plays one card.  
3. **Swap hands** (exchange remaining cards).  

On your turn, play a card to perform one of:  
- **Harvest and Store**  
- **Produce and Sell**  
- **Upgrade and Clean**  

d) **Windmill Phase**  
- Give windmill to player with **fewer stored resources**.  
- Tie: windmill goes to player who **did not have it this round**.  
- Advance year marker.  

#### Dry Year Phases  
a) **Seeding Phase**  
- Wheat → 5  
- Barley → 4  
- Rye → 4  
- Hops → 4  
- River → all 18 water  

b) **Card Phase**  
- Each player picks up **cards they played for harvest** last round.  
- Replenish hand to 5 cards (windmill holder first).  
- Place **3 exchange cards** face up on the board.  

c) **Action Phase**  
- Windmill holder starts.  
- Players alternate playing one card each (no hand swapping).  
- **Exchange Option**: Instead of playing a card, swap it with an exchange card, then play the taken card immediately.  

d) **Windmill Phase**  
- Give windmill to player with **fewer stored resources** (tie rule as above).  
- Discard:  
  - All 3 exchange cards  
  - All cards played for harvest this round  
- Advance year marker.  
- If marker reaches the end (after round 6), game ends.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### A) Harvest and Store  
- Play card face up in front of you → forms **harvest column**.  
- Harvest **total** of each resource shown across **all cards** in your harvest column.  
- Collect from fields/river only.  
- If insufficient tokens, take what’s available; forfeit rest (unless upgrades allow otherwise).  
- Store tokens in your **storage units** (9 initial units, each holds 1 token).  

**Overflow Rule**:  
If you collect more than 9 tokens:  
- Choose which tokens (new + stored) to keep (max 9).  
- Offer excess to opponent.  
- Opponent may take and store as many as they can.  
- Remaining excess returns to supply.  

#### B) Produce and Sell  
- Play **beer card** to brewery or **bread card** to bakery.  
- Spend **exact resources** shown in recipe section from your storage.  
- If unable to pay, cannot play the card.  
- After payment, **flip card face down** (sold).  
- **Limit**: 1 card per bakery/brewery unless upgrades allow more.  

#### C) Upgrade and Clean  
- Slide card **face up** under board so only **upgrade section** is visible.  
- Match icon to correct **upgrade slot** (6 types).  
- Multiple upgrades per slot allowed; stack visibly.  
- **Immediately after playing upgrade**, clean **bakery and brewery**:  
  - Remove all **sold (face-down)** cards.  
  - Place them **face down beside board** (fan out for visibility).  
  - These count toward scoring.  
- You may view your own sold cards at any time.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After round 6:  
1. Reveal all sold cards (beside board + any in bakery/brewery).  
2. Separate into **beer** and **bread**.  
3. Add coin values on cards for each type.  
4. Apply **upgrade bonuses** (e.g., +1 per sold card of a type).  
5. Final score = **lower** of beer and bread totals.  

**Tiebreakers**:  
1. Higher **total** of the **other** (higher) type wins.  
2. If still tied, player **without windmill** wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Draw deck empty?** Shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
- **Can I look at card backs?** Yes, including draw deck, but cannot reorder or peek at fronts.  
- **Can I look at my own cards?** Yes: sold cards, harvest column cards. Never opponent’s.  
- **Hand swapping in fruitful years:** Happens after both players play one card. Repeat until hands are empty.  
- **Exchange cards (dry years):** Can be swapped into hand only by giving up a hand card and playing the exchange card immediately.  
- **Upgrade stacking:** Multiple copies stack; benefits add if applicable.  
- **"Collect" means:** Take from field/river → storage. If field is empty, cannot collect (unless upgrade says otherwise).  
- **Water collection order:** If both players have water-collection upgrades, windmill holder collects first.  
- **Storage upgrades:** Some add storage units (e.g., +2 for water only). Water can be moved between storage units at any time.  
- **Production limits:** Upgrades can increase max cards in bakery/brewery beyond 1.  
- **Resource substitution:** Some upgrades let you substitute one resource for another in recipes (e.g., wheat for hops), but no actual tokens are taken—this is virtual.  
- **Scoring upgrades:**  
  - "Gain 1 coin per sold card of its type" → applies at end.  
  - "Gain 2 coins if you meet requirement" → choose **one type** to apply both coins.
