## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Evolution, players adapt their species using Traits to survive in a dynamic ecosystem. The goal is to maximize points by feeding species, increasing population, and evolving effective Traits. The player with the most points at game end wins.

2. Components  
- 1 Watering Hole Board  
- 1 First Player Marker  
- 129 Trait Cards (17 Carnivore, 7 of each other Trait)  
- 24 Species Boards  
- 48 Wooden Markers (for Body Size and Population)  
- 175–180 Food Tokens (unlimited; substitutes allowed)  
- 6 Food Token Bags  
- 6 Player Aids  

3. Setup  
- Place the Watering Hole Board in the center.  
- Form the Food Bank with Food Tokens.  
- Give each player a Food Token Bag.  
- Shuffle the Trait Card deck and place it face down.  
- Randomly select the first player and give them the First Player Marker.  
- In the first round, each player receives a Species Board with Population and Body Size set to 1.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has four phases:  
1. Deal Cards (and Species)  
2. Select Food  
3. Play Cards  
4. Feeding  

The game ends when the Trait Card deck must be reshuffled during Phase 1; that round is the last.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Phase 1: Deal Cards (and Species)**  
- Any player with no Species receives one (Population and Body Size = 1).  
- Deal 3 cards + 1 card per Species the player controls.  
- If the deck is exhausted and must be reshuffled during this phase, it is the final round.  

**Phase 2: Select Food**  
- Each player secretly selects one Trait Card to place face down on the Watering Hole.  
- The number in the leaf (bottom right) determines plant food contribution.  
- Cards are revealed in Phase 4.  

**Phase 3: Play Cards**  
Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, players may play any number of cards for:  
1. **Play a Trait** – Place a Trait Card face down on a Species.  
   - No duplicate Traits per Species.  
   - Max 3 Traits per Species. To add a fourth, discard one first.  
2. **Create a New Species** – Discard a Trait Card face up; place a new Species Board (Population and Body Size = 1) at either end of your row.  
3. **Increase Body Size or Population** – Discard a Trait Card face up to increase one of these by 1.  
   - Maximum of 6 for either.  
4. **Discard a Trait** – Remove a Trait without replacement.  
After all players finish, reveal all played Trait Cards.  

**Phase 4: Feeding**  
1. **Reveal Food Cards**  
   - First player reveals all face-down Food Cards.  
   - Sum the food values; add that many Plant Food tokens to (or remove from) the Watering Hole.  
   - Negative total = remove food.  
   - Cards go to discard pile.  

2. **Feeding Species**  
   - Begin with first player and proceed clockwise.  
   - Each player must feed one hungry Species (has less food than Population).  
   - Feeding ends when all Species are full or no hungry Species can eat.  

   **Non-Carnivores**  
   - Take 1 Plant Food from Watering Hole.  
   - Traits like Foraging or Long Neck may modify this.  
   - Can eat Meat Food via Scavenger or Cooperation.  

   **Carnivores**  
   - Cannot eat Plant Food under any circumstances.  
   - Attack another Species if:  
     - Carnivore Body Size > Target Body Size  
     - Carnivore has Traits to overcome target’s defenses (e.g., Ambush vs. Warning Call)  
   - On successful attack:  
     - Attacked Species loses 1 Population.  
     - If Population drops below food eaten, excess food goes to owner’s bag.  
     - If Population reaches 0, Species goes Extinct.  
     - Attacker gains Meat Food = Body Size of attacked Species.  

3. **End of Feeding**  
   - Reduce any Species’ Population to match food eaten.  
   - Species with 0 food eaten goes Extinct.  
   - All food eaten is placed in player’s Food Token Bag.  
   - Remaining Plant Food stays in Watering Hole.  
   - Pass First Player Marker to the left.  

**Extinction**  
- Discard Species Board and all its Trait Cards.  
- Draw one Trait Card per discarded Trait.  
- If deck must be reshuffled during this draw, next round is final.  
- Close gap if extinct Species was between two others.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after the round where deck must be reshuffled in Phase 1.  
Final scoring:  
- 1 point per Food Token in player’s bag.  
- 1 point per Population of each surviving Species.  
- 1 point per Trait Card on surviving Species.  
Total points; highest wins.  
Tiebreakers:  
1. Most Trait Card points  
2. Most Population points  
3. If still tied, order pizza and replay.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Trait Conflicts**: Traits with green leafy border (e.g., Long Neck, Fertile) trigger before Food Cards are revealed. Players choose order if multiple apply.  
- **Carnivore Feeding**: Must attack if a legal target exists, even own Species or one with Horns.  
- **Cooperation**: Triggers when Species takes food; right adjacent Species takes 1 of same type from same source. Does not trigger from Fat Tissue.  
- **Fat Tissue**: Stores food up to Body Size. Before Food Cards revealed, move stored food to Species (does not trigger Cooperation).  
- **Intelligence**:  
  - Non-Carnivore: Discard 1 card to gain 2 Plant Food.  
  - Carnivore: Discard 1 card to negate one defensive Trait for next attack.  
- **2-Player Rules**: Remove 40 random Trait Cards; max 2 Traits per Species.  
- **6-Player Rules**: Use Quick Play Variant—Phase 3 is simultaneous, not turn-based.
