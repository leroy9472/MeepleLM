## The Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation (2002) — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *The Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation*, two players take opposing sides in the struggle for Middle-earth. The Good Player seeks to guide Frodo safely to Mordor to destroy the One Ring. The Dark Player aims to stop Frodo by defeating him or overwhelming the Shire with evil forces.

**Win Conditions:**  
- **Good Player wins if:**  
  - Frodo enters Mordor (immediate win, regardless of enemy presence).  
- **Dark Player wins if:**  
  - Frodo is defeated in battle.  
  - The Dark Player has 3 characters in the Shire.  
  - The Good Player is unable to move a character on their turn.  
- **Either player loses if:**  
  - They are unable to move a character during their turn.

### 2. Components  
- Game board depicting regions of Middle-earth: Shire, Eregion, Moria, Fangorn, Mirkwood, Rohan, Gondor, Mordor, and mountain regions.  
- Character pieces (8 per player):  
  - Good: Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir, Merry, Pippin  
  - Dark: Sauron, Witch-king, Saruman, Balrog, Mouth of Sauron, Nazgûl, Orcs, etc. (exact set may vary)  
- 18 cards (9 per player): strength and text cards used during battles  
- Reference materials (optional): Character Reference Chart, Fellowship/Sauron Reference Cards (from deluxe variant)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board so the Shire is closest to the Good Player and Mordor to the Dark Player.  
2. Each player places 4 characters in their home region:  
   - Good Player: 4 characters in the Shire  
   - Dark Player: 4 characters in Mordor  
3. Remaining 4 characters are placed one per region in surrounding areas (e.g., Eregion, Mirkwood, Gondor, etc.).  
   - No character may be placed in a mountain region at start (unless specified by variant).  
4. Shuffle and deal 9 cards to each player.  
5. The Dark Player takes the first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn consists of the following steps:  
1. **Move Phase:**  
   - The active player moves one character forward by one region.  
   - Movement is generally forward only, unless modified by special rules or character ability.  
2. **Battle Resolution (if applicable):**  
   - If the moving character enters a region occupied by one or more enemy characters, a battle occurs.  
   - Resolve all battles in that region before the turn ends.  
3. **End of Turn:**  
   - After all battles are resolved, the turn ends.  
   - Players retain their cards until all 9 have been played; then, they pick up their discard pile to form a new draw deck.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Movement Rules  
- Characters move forward by one region per turn.  
- **No sideways movement in mountain regions**, even via card text.  
- **Maximum occupancy per region:**  
  - Shire / Mordor: 4 characters max  
  - Mountain regions (e.g., Moria): 1 character max  
  - All other regions: 2 characters max  
- Players may mix characters from both sides in the same region (after movement or during battle).  
- Players may "shuffle" characters in the same region to hide identities.

#### Special Movement (Good Player Only)  
- **Anduin River:** Allows downstream movement: Mirkwood → Fangorn → Rohan (not reversible).  
- **Tunnel of Moria:** Allows movement from Eregion → Fangorn (not reversible, even when retreating).

#### Battle Rules  
A battle occurs when a character enters a region with one or more enemy characters.  

**Battle Sequence:**  
1. **Choose Opponent (if multiple enemies):**  
   - Attacker randomly selects one enemy to fight (e.g., by drawing unseen).  
   - Exception: Palantir (if in play) allows controlled selection.  
2. **Reveal Characters:**  
   - Both players reveal the characters involved.  
   - Character abilities are checked.  
   - **Special Rule:** If the Dark Player reveals the Balrog in Moria while the Good Player is using the Tunnel of Moria, the Good character is defeated without battle.  
3. **Play Cards:**  
   - Each player selects one card face-down.  
   - Cards are revealed simultaneously.  
   - **Text Cards:** Resolve effects.  
     - If both players play text cards, the **Dark Player’s effect resolves first**.  
   - If a text card forces a retreat or victory, battle ends.  
4. **Compare Strengths:**  
   - If battle continues, each player adds the **Strength value** on their card to their character’s base strength.  
   - Higher total wins.  
   - **Tie:** Both characters are defeated and removed.  
5. **Continue Battling (if necessary):**  
   - If enemy characters remain in the region, the attacker randomly selects another and repeats the battle.  
   - Continue until only one side (or neither) controls the region.  
6. **Conceal Characters:**  
   - After all battles, characters are concealed again.

#### Card Mechanics  
- Each player has 9 cards: mix of **text cards** (special effects) and **strength cards** (numeric values).  
- Cards are played one per battle.  
- After all 9 cards are used, players pick up their discard pile to form a new hand.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when any of the following occurs:  
- **Good Player wins:** Frodo enters Mordor.  
- **Dark Player wins:**  
  - Frodo is defeated in battle.  
  - Dark Player has 3 characters in the Shire.  
  - Good Player cannot move any character on their turn.  
- **Either player loses:** If they cannot move a character during their turn (e.g., all are blocked or eliminated).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you retreat into a region with enemy characters?**  
  No. Retreats must be into empty or friendly-controlled regions.  
- **Can you exceed region limits via card text?**  
  No. Maximums are absolute and cannot be overridden.  
- **Does Balrog auto-win in Moria only when Good uses the tunnel?**  
  Yes. The Balrog defeats any Good character moving through the Tunnel of Moria (Eregion → Fangorn) without battle.  
- **Can Frodo be moved via river or tunnel?**  
  Yes, as long as movement rules are followed.  
- **What happens if both players run out of cards simultaneously?**  
  Continue playing: after all cards are played, pick up discards to form a new hand.  
- **Can you shuffle characters in mountain regions?**  
  Yes, as long as only one character per mountain region (so shuffling only applies if you have multiple turns with same character or switch during non-mountain phases).
