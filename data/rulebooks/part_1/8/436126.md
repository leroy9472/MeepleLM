### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### A. Play a Fish  
1. **Place a Diver**: Put an available diver in the gray box at top-left of your ocean.  
2. **Pay the Cost**: Choose a card from hand and pay its cost:  
   - Discard cards (■) from hand → personal discard pile.  
   - Remove eggs (♀) or young (♂) from ocean → general supply.  
   - Consume a shorter fish: place new fish on top of a fish/forage with shorter length.  
3. **Place the Fish**:  
   - Must match zone(s) indicated (Sunlight, Twilight, Midnight).  
   - Fish with blue/purple/green band → only matching dive site (column).  
   - Others → any column.  
   - May cover:  
     - Empty slot  
     - Egg/young → transfer tokens to new fish  
     - Shorter fish → consumption (see above)  
4. **Resolve "WHEN PLAYED" Ability**:  
   - Optional. May choose order if multiple benefits.  
   - If “all players”, each decides independently whether to take benefit.

#### B. Dive  
1. **Select Dive Site**: Place diver at top of one column (dive site).  
2. **Top Bonus**: If you have ≥1 fish in Sunlight Zone of that column, gain one of:  
   - : Draw 1 fish card  
   - ♀: Place 1 egg on a fish without one  
   - ♂: Hatch 1 egg → young  
3. **Move Down Column**: Go row by row (Sunlight → Twilight → Midnight):  
   - **"IF ACTIVATED" Ability**: On each fish, gain benefit if diver lands on it.  
   - **Zone Bonus**: At Twilight and Midnight levels — if you have ≥1 fish in that zone of the column, gain same bonus types as top.  
4. **Bottom Bonus**:  
   - If **first diver** to reach bottom of this site this week:  
     - Place diver in the circle ( ) at bottom  
     - Gain bottom bonus (varies by site; e.g., gain egg)  
   - If **not first**:  
     - Place diver in gray box below site  
     - No bonus  

*Note: You must move through all zones even if no fish present.*

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End of Week (after 6 turns per player) — Weeks 1–3 only

   - Week 1: 1 point per egg + 1 point per young  
   - Week 2: 2 points per full row of fish (cards or forage)  
   - Week 3: 2 points per school  
2. **3-Point Bonus (Side B only)**: Awarded to player(s) who gained the most achievement points that week.  
3. Retrieve all divers.  
4. Pass first-player token clockwise.  
5. Advance week tracker.  

*Week 4 ends directly in final scoring.*

#### End of Game (after Week 4)  
Score in this order:  
1. **GAME END (Yellow)**: Activate any "GAME END" abilities that don’t award points. Then gain points from those that do (in any order). *Not on consumed fish.*  
2. **FISH**: Points printed on visible fish cards. *Not on consumed fish.*  
3. **CONSUMED FISH**: 1 point each (includes forage fish and cards tucked under others).  
4. **EGGS AND YOUNG**: 1 point each (all eggs and individual young).  
5. **SCHOOLS**: 6 points each.  

Add these to prior achievement points. Highest total wins.  

**Tiebreaker**:  
- Most fish cards in hand → winner  
- Still tied → shared victory

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I play a fish on a slot with a school?**  
A: Yes. The school remains. You may not place a second school in the same slot.

**Q: What happens when I consume a fish with tokens?**  
A: All eggs, young, or schools on the consumed fish transfer to the new fish.

A: Yes. You still move diver down, but gain no bonuses or abilities.

**Q: Can I gain multiple benefits from the same "IF ACTIVATED" card in one dive?**  
A: No. Only once per dive, as diver passes through once.

**Q: Can I break up a school into young?**  
A: No. Schools are permanent.

**Q: Can I move a young through a slot with 2 young?**  
A: No. A school forms immediately in that slot, ending movement.

A: No. Schools cannot enter or pass through slots with other schools.

**Q: What if the fish deck runs out?**  
A: Shuffle all players’ discard piles into a new deck.
