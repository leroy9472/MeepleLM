## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Conan is a cooperative adventure board game set in the Hyborian Age. One player takes the role of the Overlord, controlling enemy forces, while 1–5 other players control heroic characters. The objective varies by scenario, but generally involves heroes completing specific goals (e.g., escaping the board, retrieving an item, defeating a boss) before being overwhelmed or before a time limit expires. The Overlord wins if the heroes fail to complete their objectives.

### 2. Components
- Hero character sheets and models
- Overlord’s Book of Skelos (dashboard)
- Unit tiles (Overlord forces and event tiles)
- Gem tokens (blue for heroes, red for Overlord)
- Dice (red, yellow, orange)
- Turn track and life point markers
- Spell, weapon, and item cards
- Ally tiles
- Scenario-specific tokens (e.g., reinforcement, opening, chest, spiked fence)

### 3. Setup
- Choose a scenario and follow its setup instructions.
- Overlord sets up the Book of Skelos: places unit tiles in the river, assigns starting gems to reserve and fatigue zones, and places models.
- Heroes choose characters, take corresponding sheets, models, and starting equipment/spells.
- Each hero places starting gems in reserve and fatigue zones as specified.
- Place the turn marker on 0 and set life point markers.
- Prepare asset deck if required.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Hero Turn**
   - **Start Phase**: Move gems from action spaces to fatigue zone.
   - **Stance Phase**: Each hero chooses Aggressive or Cautious stance, then refreshes gems.
   - **Action Phase**: Heroes perform actions in any order until all pass.
   - **End Phase**: Move all gems from action spaces, spell cards, and ally tiles to fatigue zone.

2. **Overlord Turn**
   - **Recovery Phase**: Move gems from fatigue to reserve based on recovery value.
   - **Advance Turn Marker**: Move marker forward one space.
   - **Activation Phase**: Activate up to two tiles (unit or event).
   - **End Phase**: Move all spent gems to fatigue zone.

Turns alternate until victory conditions are met.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Hero Actions
- **Melee Attack**: Assign gems to melee space, roll dice, add weapon bonus. Unarmed attacks subtract 2.
- **Ranged Attack**: Requires line of sight (LOS). Hindering applies. +1 yellow die if attacking downward.
- **Guard**: Assign gems to guard space. Parry with weapon/shield (only shield for ranged/area attacks). Armor bonus always applies.
- **Move**: Aggressive heroes gain free movement points (MP) equal to base movement. Actions interrupt free movement. Extra MP via gem spending (1 gem = 1 MP).
- **Manipulation**:
  - *Simple* (1 gem): Pick up, give, take, catch.
  - *Complex* (roll dice): Open chest (difficulty 2), throw object (difficulty = distance).
- **Reroll**: 1 gem = 1 die rerolled.
- **Cast Spell**: Pay spell cost in gems. Reaction spells can be cast anytime.

#### Overlord Actions
- **Activate Unit Tile**: Pay activation cost (position in river). Move units (use free base movement first), then attack (each unit once).
- **Extra Movement**: Spend 1 gem = 1 MP (max = base movement).
- **Guard**: Assign gems to guard benefit. Roll orange dice, add to armor.
- **Reroll**: 1 gem = 1 die rerolled (any time).
- **Cast Spell**: Activate spellcaster’s tile, pay cost. Reaction spells can be cast during hero turn.

#### Combat Resolution
- **Attack**: Roll dice (include elevation bonus, weapon bonus).
- **Reroll**: Spend gems or use free rerolls.
- **Defense**: Defender may guard (spend gems, choose parry/dodge). Armor bonus always applies.
- **Damage**: Subtract defense from attack total. Apply damage to defender’s gem zones (fatigue → action/spell → reserve → wound).

#### Special Rules
- **Hindering**: Applies to movement, ranged attacks, complex manipulations. Each uncancelled enemy causes -1 MP or -1 symbol.
- **Falling Damage**: Roll as per scenario. Cannot guard or use armor. Rerolls allowed. Carrier and carried both take damage.
- **Area Attacks**: Attack all in area. Roll once. Only armor and dodging apply (no weapon parry).
- **Occupied Areas**: Cannot enter if base doesn’t fit. Melee range to adjacent areas, but cannot attack out.
- **Leadership**: Spend 1 gem to activate ally. Ally moves and attacks like Overlord unit.
- **Dredging the River**: Spend 2 fatigue gems to remove dead tile permanently.
- **Reinforcements**: Spend reinforcement points (from event tile) to return models to board.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Conditions**: Scenario-specific (e.g., escape with jewel, defeat boss).
- **Overlord Wins**: If all heroes die or time expires (turn 12 in some scenarios).
- **Hero Wins**: Complete objective (e.g., at least one hero escapes with jewel).
- **Damage & Death**: Move gems to wound zone. When all gems are wounded, hero dies.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Unarmed Attacks**: Only heroes can be unarmed; Overlord units always have weapons.
- **Throwing**: Object must have encumbrance ≤3. Difficulty = distance. Success: drop in target area; failure: drop at distance equal to manipulation power.
- **Opening Chests**: Complex manipulation, difficulty 2. Success: take top asset card or leave it for later pickup.
- **Line of Sight**: Blocked by obstacles. Higher areas can see lower. Models do not block LOS.
- **Elevation Bonus**: Attacker rolls extra yellow die when target is at lower elevation (ranged only).
- **Skill Restrictions**: Skills disabled if encumbrance threshold exceeded.
- **Simultaneous Effects**: Resolve in player order or as specified.
