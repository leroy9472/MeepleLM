## 7 Wonders: Architects Solo Mode – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
This is a solitaire adaptation of *7 Wonders: Architects*, designed for one player competing against a single AI-like opponent ("the Opponent") represented by a neutral player. The goal is to achieve the highest score based on victory points from buildings, military, science, economy, and progress tokens. The challenge level adjusts how much the Opponent’s score impacts the player’s final result.

### 2. Components  
- 7 Wonders boards (Alexandria, Babylon, Ephesus, Giza, Halicarnassus, Olympia, Rhodes)  
- Progress tokens (15 total, with various effects and point values)  
- 3-player card decks (Age I, II, III)  
- Central deck (formed during setup)  
- Cat pawn  
- 6-sided die (used for randomization)  
- Coins (as in base game)  
- Player board and Opponent board setup  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Choose Your Wonder**: Select one of the 7 Wonders to play as.  
2. **Assign Opponent Wonder**: Choose one of the remaining Wonders to represent the Opponent. The other five Wonders are unused.  
3. **Prepare Decks**:  
   - Shuffle the three Age decks separately.  
   - Form a "central deck" by placing the remaining two Age I cards (not used in your or Opponent’s starting hand) face down in the center.  
4. **Initial Hands**:  
   - Each player (you and the Opponent) receives 7 cards from their respective Age I deck.  
   - Reveal one card from each player’s hand (per standard 2-player rules).  
5. **Progress Tokens**:  
   - Mix the 15 progress tokens face down.  
   - Draw 3 face-up tokens.  
   - **Opponent Setup**:  
     - Easy Mode: Opponent starts with **no** progress token.  
     - Normal Mode: Randomly assign **one** of the three possible tokens linked to the Opponent’s Wonder (see list below).  
     - Hard Mode: Assign **two** such tokens (randomly chosen).  
   - Replace any taken token immediately from the face-down pile.  
6. **Cat Pawn**: Starts with no owner; awarded based on card play.  
7. **Die**: Keep a d6 ready for randomization decisions.

**Opponent’s Starting Token Options by Wonder**:  
- Alexandria: Economy / Jewellery / Urbanism  
- Babylon: Crafts / Science / Urbanism  
- Ephesus: Crafts / Jewellery / Science  
- Giza: Architecture / Crafts / Jewellery  
- Halicarnassus: Architecture / Jewellery / Urbanism  
- Olympia: Crafts / Jewellery / Propaganda  
- Rhodes: Crafts / Propaganda / Urbanism  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds over three Ages, each with 6 turns (except Age I: 7 turns in 2-player setup).

Each turn follows this sequence:

1. **Card Selection Phase**:
   - All players (you and the Opponent) select one card simultaneously.
   - You choose from: your hand, the Opponent’s revealed card, or the top card of the central deck (if face up).
   - The Opponent selects based on a fixed priority system (see Core Mechanics).
   - If you take the Opponent’s card, they take the top card of the central deck (if available).
   - If you take the central card, you gain control of the Cat pawn (if applicable).

2. **Cat Pawn Resolution**:
   - If you play a Cat card and the Opponent does not, you gain the Cat pawn.
   - If the Opponent plays a Cat card and you do not, they gain it.
   - If both play Cat cards, the last one played (clockwise order) gains it.
   - Whoever has the Cat pawn flips the top card of the central deck face up at the start of their turn.

3. **Card Resolution Phase**:
   - You resolve your card first (play, build, discard for coins, etc.).
   - Then the Opponent resolves theirs.

4. **Progress Token Selection**:
   - After card resolution, if a player is eligible to take a progress token (via card effect or Wonder), they do so.
   - **You choose first**, then the Opponent.
   - The Opponent takes the token with the highest **printed victory point value** (12, 6, 2, or 1). If none have points, takes the top face-down token.

5. **Discard Central Card**:
   - If the top card of the central deck is face up, discard it after the turn.

6. **Pass Hands**:
   - Pass remaining cards to the appropriate neighbor (left/right per Age, as in standard game).
   - Draw new cards accordingly.

7. **Replace Progress Tokens**:
   - Any taken progress token is replaced from the face-down stack.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Opponent AI Decision Rules  
The Opponent uses a strict priority list when selecting a card:

1. **Extra Card Grant**: Any card that grants an extra card (via Progress token effect).  
2. **Yellow Card**: Prioritizes Yellow cards.  
3. **Grey Card**: A Grey card that helps construct an available Wonder stage.  
4. **Green Card Duplication**: Another copy of a Green card already owned.  
5. **Missing Green Card**: If exactly two Green cards are owned, takes the missing one.  
6. **Red Card (Military)**:  
   - If Opponent’s shields ≥ your shields → takes a Red card with 1 or 2 horns.  
   - If Opponent’s shields < your shields → takes a Red card with no horns.  
7. **Blue Card with Cat Icon**  

If no priority applies, roll the d6:  
- 1 = Your deck  
- 2 = Opponent’s deck  
- 3–6 = Central deck (even if face down)  

If multiple decks satisfy a priority, roll:  
- 1–3 = Your deck  
- 4–6 = Opponent’s deck (never central deck in this case)  

#### Wonder Effects (Used by Player Only)  
- **Alexandria**: Take top card from **any** deck (your, Opponent’s, or central).  
- **Babylon**: Choose 1 of the 4 face-up progress tokens.  
- **Ephesus**: Take top card from central deck.  
- **Rhodes**: +1 Shield.  
- **Halicarnassus**: Take top 5 cards from left or right deck, choose 1, shuffle rest back.  
- **Olympia**: Take top card from both left and right decks.  
- **Giza**: No special effect; higher base VP.  

#### Progress Token Effects  
- **Urbanism / Crafts / Jewellery / Science / Propaganda**: When taking a matching card type, draw **1 extra card** from the 3 available (you choose which).  
- **Architecture**: When constructing a Wonder stage, draw 1 extra card.  
- **Economy**: One Yellow card is worth **2 coins** instead of 1.  
- **Engineering**: Ignore "identical" or "different" resource restrictions when building Wonder stages.  
- **Tactics**: +2 Shields.  
- **Decor**: +4 VP if Wonder incomplete; +6 VP if fully built.  
- **Politics**: +1 VP per 4 symbols on Blue cards.  
- **Strategy**: +1 VP per Military Victory token.  
- **Education**: +2 VP per Progress token (including this one).  
- **Culture**: Two copies exist. +4 VP if you have one; +12 VP if you have both.  

#### Constructing Wonder Stages  
- Costs: 2 different, 2 identical, 3 different, 3 identical, or 4 different resources.  
- Must build from bottom to top.  
- Must construct all lower stages before building higher ones.  
- If you have required resources (Grey and/or Yellow cards), **you must build** the stage.  
- Discard used cards, flip stage to constructed side.  
- Some stages grant immediate effects.  
- If multiple stages can be built, **all must be built** in one turn.  

#### Grey Cards  
Provide resources for building Wonder stages. Cannot be used for anything else unless converted via Yellow cards.  

#### Yellow Cards  
Provide coins, which act as wild resources to fulfill Wonder construction costs.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after Age III. Final scoring includes:

- **Blue Cards**: VP as printed.  
- **Red Cards**: Military conflicts resolved per age. Gain 1 VP per victory; lose 1 VP per defeat.  
- **Green Cards**: Use science symbols to score via combinations (standard rules).  
- **Yellow Cards**: VP from coins (1 VP per 3 coins) and special effects (e.g., Economy).  
- **Wonder Stages**: VP as printed.  
- **Progress Tokens**: Score per their end-game effects (e.g., Education, Culture, Decor).  

**Final Score Adjustment (Difficulty Settings)**:
- **Easy**: Your total score is final.  
- **Medium**: Final score = Your score – Opponent’s total score.  
- **Hard**: Final score = Your score – (Opponent’s score × 2).  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can the Opponent build their Wonder?**  
  No. The Opponent does not construct Wonder stages. Grey cards they acquire are discarded when resolved.  

- **What happens if the central deck runs out?**  
  Shuffle discarded central cards to form a new deck when needed.  

- **Can I take a face-down central card?**  
  Only if a card or Wonder effect allows you to take from the central deck. You take the top card, whether face up or down.  

- **Does the Opponent use Cat pawn abilities?**  
  No. The Cat pawn only flips the top central card when the Opponent has it, but they do not use its card-revealing benefit.  

- **Halicarnassus Special – How does Opponent choose deck?**  
  The Opponent chooses the deck (left or right) whose top card has **higher priority** in their selection list (e.g., Yellow > Grey, etc.).  

- **Multiple Progress Token Effects?**  
  Yes. If you have multiple tokens that trigger on card type (e.g., Urbanism + Jewellery), you may draw **multiple extra cards** when taking a qualifying card.  

- **What if no cards qualify any priority?**  
  Roll the die as per rules to determine source deck.
