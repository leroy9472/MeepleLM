### 3. Setup
1. **Player Decks**: Each player receives:
   - 1¢ cards: T, R, S, L, N
   - 2¢ Wild/Fame cards: 5 copies
   Shuffle into a personal draw pile.
2. **Fame Piles**: Create 4 face-up piles based on cost (5¢, 8¢, 11¢, 17¢). Quantity varies by player count (per rulebook).
3. **Letter Offer**:
   - Sort non-Fame cards by cost (2¢–10¢).
   - Combine 8¢, 9¢, and 10¢ into one pile.
   - Shuffle each cost pile. Place face-up in a row.
   - Reveal top card of each pile; place second card below (alternate card). *Exception*: 2¢ pile has no alternate.
4. **Common Cards**:
   - Shuffle 4 Common Cards (e.g., A, E, I, O, plus optional Spacebar/Dyslexic).
   - Place face-up on Length Track, splayed so “7 Letters” is visible.
5. **Optional Additions**:
   - **Attack Cards**: Add to Offer piles if using.
   - **Player Powers**: Shuffle and deal 1 to each player.
   - **Award Card**: Shuffle, reveal 1, place in Offer.
   - **Theme Card**: Shuffle, reveal 1, place in Offer.
6. **Starting Player**: Choose randomly or by narrative (e.g., last to finish a novel).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn, perform these steps in order:

1. **Discard Attack Cards**  
   Discard any Attack Cards you played on your previous turn.

2. **Create a Word**  
   - Use cards from your hand to form a valid word (no proper nouns, names, or places).
   - May use the top **Common Card** once per word by referencing it (leave on track).
   - **Fame Cards** act as wilds (any letter).
   - Not all cards need to be used.

3. **Check Word Length**  
   - Count total letters (including wilds and two-letter cards as 2).
   - If word length ≥ highest number on Length Track, gain the top Common Card (add to discard pile).
   - Slide track down to reveal next threshold (e.g., 8 Letters, 9 Letters…).
   - If last Common Card is taken, game ends after current turn.

4. **Resolve Abilities**  
   - Activate abilities on cards used in the word.
   - “Must” = mandatory; “May” = optional.
   - Abilities resolved in any order.
   - **Trash** = remove card from game.
   - **Gain** = acquire a card and place in discard.
   - **Attack Cards** stay in play until your next turn.

5. **Score the Word**  
   - Sum values in **top-left corner** of all letters in word (including Common Card if used).
   - Apply score bonuses (e.g., +1¢, Double Word Score).
   - **Double Word Score copied**: Triples score (×3), not quadruples.

6. **Buy Cards**  
   - Spend total word score to buy visible cards from Offer or Fame piles.
   - Total cost (lower-left number) must not exceed word score.
   - May buy multiple cards.
   - **Fame Cards**: Only top card of each pile is available.
   - **Letter Cards**: May buy top card or alternate card.
   - If alternate card is bought, replace it with top card of its pile.
   - Immediately refill Offer if pile is drawn from.

7. **Discard Cards**  
   - Discard all cards from your word and hand into your discard pile.
   - **Exception**: Attack Cards remain in play until start of your next turn.
   - Gained cards (from abilities) are also discarded.

8. **Draw Next Hand**  
   - Draw 5 cards + any extra cards from abilities.
   - If draw pile is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new draw pile and continue.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Word Formation**: Valid English words only; no proper nouns.
- **Common Card**: Shared resource; use once per word; gaining it advances the Length Track.
- **Wild Cards**: 2¢ Fame cards function as any letter.
- **Two-Letter Cards**: Fixed order; count as two letters.
- **Scoring**: Based on top-left number; bonuses applied after base sum.
- **Deckbuilding**: Bought cards go to discard pile; recycled when draw pile is empty.
- **Attack Cards**: Limit opponents until your next turn (e.g., “Skip next word”).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **End Game Triggered When**:
  - Any **two Fame piles** are empty, OR
  - No more **Common Cards** remain on Length Track.
  - Current player finishes their turn; game ends immediately.

- **Final Scoring**:
  - Sum all **Fame points** (bottom-left of cards) in your deck, hand, and discard pile.
  - **Theme Card**: 1 Fame point per token on card (Solo) or player holding it gets points.
  - **Award Cards**: Awarded at game end per card text.
  - **Tiebreaker**: Most Common Cards. If still tied, consider house rules.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use the Common Card more than once?**  
  No. Only once per word.

- **Does a two-letter card count as one or two letters?**  
  Two letters for word length and scoring.

- **If I copy “Double Word Score,” is it ×4?**  
  No. It triples the score (×3), not quadruples.

- **Can “Wild” be copied as an ability?**  
  No.

- **What happens if I can’t form a word?**  
  Optional rules allow discarding hand for a cube or using others’ suggestions (reward cubes).

- **When do Attack Cards discard?**  
  At the start of your next turn.

- **Can I save unused money?**  
  No. Unspent score is lost.

- **What if I run out of cards to draw?**  
  Shuffle discard pile into new draw pile and continue.

- **Solo Play (Bot Rules)**:
  - Bot draws 5 + tokens (from your extra draws).
  - Scores all drawn cards as a word (ignores abilities).
  - Buys most expensive Fame card it can afford (cannot buy 5¢ first).
  - If no Fame card affordable, buys most expensive letter card.
  - Bot’s final score: sum of all letter scores + 1 Fame per Fame-point card (adjustable: Easy 0, Hard 2).

- **Expansions**:
  - **Spacebar**: Use to create two words; score +1¢; length = both words +1 (space).
  - **Dyslexic**: Reverse a two-letter card; score +1¢.
  - **Theme Cards**: Players vote on theme fit; card changes hands if word matches.
  - **Player Powers**: Unique one-time or ongoing abilities.
  - **Award Cards**: End-game bonuses (e.g., “Most 5¢ cards”).
