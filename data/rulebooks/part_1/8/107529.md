# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
By skillfully building settlements, players create their own kingdoms aiming to earn the most gold at the end of the game. The 3 randomly selected Kingdom Builder cards determine the scoring conditions. Victory is awarded to the player with the most gold; ties are shared.

## 2. Components
- 8 double-sided game board sections (4 used per game; 1 flipped to serve as score track)
- 160 settlements (40 per player in 4 colors)
- 4 gold markers (1 per player)
- 1 start player tile
- 28 location tiles:
  - 2x Oracle
  - 4x Farm
  - 2x Harbor
  - 4x Paddock
  - 4x Tavern
  - 4x Tower
  - 4x Barn
  - 4x Oasis
- 8 summary cards (pictograms of extra actions)
- 25 terrain cards:
  - 5x Grass
  - 5x Flower field
  - 5x Forest
  - 5x Canyon
  - 5x Desert
- 10 Kingdom Builder cards (3 used per game)
- Optional expansion components (Nomads, Crossroads, Marshlands, Harvest, Capitol, Caves, Island, Queenie variants)

## 3. Setup
1. Choose any 4 of the 8 game board sections and assemble them into a contiguous 2×2 rectangular game board.
2. Place summary cards next to the game board sections, matching the location hexes.
3. Place 2 corresponding location tiles on each location hex.
4. Shuffle all terrain cards and place them face-down as a draw pile.
5. Shuffle the Kingdom Builder cards and draw 3 at random, placing them face-up next to the board.
6. Each player takes:
   - 40 settlements (personal supply)
   - 1 gold marker
   - 1 random terrain card (kept hidden)
7. Designate the oldest player as the start player and give them the start player tile.
8. Flip an unused board section over and place it beside the game board to serve as the score track. Each player places their gold marker on the starting (black) space.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns in clockwise order. Each turn consists of:
1. **Play Terrain Card**: Reveal the terrain card from hand.
2. **Extra Actions (Optional)**: Perform 0 or more extra actions before or after mandatory action.
3. **Mandatory Action**: Build 3 settlements (or 2 on swamps) matching the terrain card.
4. **Discard and Draw**: Discard the used terrain card and draw a new one.

### Mandatory Action
- Build 3 settlements (2 if building on swamp) on unoccupied hexes of the terrain type shown on the played card.
- Each settlement must be built one at a time.
- Each settlement must be adjacent to at least one of your existing settlements, if possible.
- If no adjacent hexes of the required terrain are available, build on any unoccupied hex of that terrain.
- If no hexes of the required terrain exist on the board, discard the card, draw a new one, and repeat.

### Extra Actions
- Acquired by building or moving a settlement adjacent to a location hex with available tiles.
- Each tile grants one extra action usable once per turn.
- Extra actions may be performed before or after the mandatory action, but not during.
- Newly collected tiles cannot be used until the next turn.
- Players may have up to two identical tiles if they come from different location hexes.

### Location Tiles & Extra Actions
When a player builds or moves a settlement adjacent to a location hex with tiles, they immediately collect one tile. The player retains the tile as long as at least one of their settlements remains adjacent to the location hex. Moving the last settlement away causes the tile to be discarded.

#### Base Game Extra Actions:
- **Barn**: Move one settlement to a hex matching the current terrain card.
- **Farm**: Build one settlement on an unoccupied grass hex.
- **Harbor**: Move one settlement to an unoccupied water hex.
- **Oasis**: Build one settlement on an unoccupied desert hex.
- **Oracle**: Build one settlement on a hex matching the current terrain card.
- **Paddock**: Move one settlement exactly two hexes in a straight line (jumping obstacles).
- **Tavern**: Build one settlement at the end of a straight line of at least 3 of your settlements.
- **Tower**: Build one settlement on an unoccupied hex at the edge of the board.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Building Rules
1. Only one settlement per hex.
2. Buildable terrain: Grass, Canyon, Desert, Flower Field, Forest. Swamps (Marshlands) and Farmland (Harvest) are also buildable.
3. Must build adjacent to your own settlement if possible.
4. If not possible:
   - Mandatory action: Build on any hex of the terrain card type.
   - Extra action: Build/move according to the action’s rule (e.g., Tower allows edge placement).

### Adjacency
Unless otherwise stated, all new settlements must be adjacent to at least one of your existing settlements. Moving a settlement breaks adjacency temporarily; the destination must be valid per the action’s rules.

### Expansions
#### Nomads
- **Nomad Hex**: Place one random nomad tile (Donation, Resettlement, Outpost, Sword, Treasure) on each silver-bordered nomad hex.
- **Claiming**: When adjacent to a nomad hex, claim the tile. It grants one extra action usable only on the next turn. The tile is removed from the game at the end of that turn.
- **Nomad Actions**:
  - **Donation**: Build 3 settlements on terrain shown on the tile.
  - **Resettlement**: Move 1–4 settlements up to 4 hexes total.
  - **Outpost**: Disregard adjacency for one built settlement this turn.

- Accessible only via extra actions.
- Does not count as a sector for Lords, Farmers, Homesteaders, Rovers.
- Knights and Discoverers can score on the island.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### End Game Trigger
The game ends when any player builds their last settlement. The current round is completed; all players get an equal number of turns.

### Final Scoring Sequence
1. **Silo Actions (if in play)**: In turn order, players resolve silo actions (build or move up to 3 per adjacent silo).
2. **Kingdom Builder Cards**: Evaluate each of the 3 cards in order, starting with the start player.
3. **Castle Scoring**: 3 gold per castle hex with at least one adjacent settlement.
4. **Palace Scoring**: 5 gold for the player with the most adjacent settlements to each palace (shared on tie).
5. **Capitol Scoring**: 1 gold per settlement within 1–2 hexes of each capitol.
6. **Task Cards (if in play)**: Score once per player if condition is met.

### Kingdom Builder Cards (Endgame)
- **Citizens**: 1 gold per 2 settlements in largest cluster.
- **Discoverers**: 1 gold per horizontal line with at least one settlement.
- **Farmers**: 3 gold per settlement in the sector with fewest of your settlements (must have settlements in all 4 sectors).
- **Fishermen**: 1 gold per settlement adjacent to water (not on water).
- **Hermits**: 1 gold per separate settlement cluster.
- **Knights**: 2 gold per settlement on the horizontal line with the most of your settlements.
- **Lords**: 12 gold for most in a sector, 6 for second (ties shared).
- **Merchants**: 4 gold per location hex linked to another by your settlements.
- **Miners**: 1 gold per settlement adjacent to mountain (not on mountain).
- **Workers**: 1 gold per settlement adjacent to a location hex.

### Red Kingdom Builder Cards (Score Immediately)
- **Families**: 2 gold if 3 mandatory settlements form a straight line.
- **Shepherds**: 2 gold if built settlement has no adjacent empty hex of same terrain.
- **Ambassadors**: 1 gold per settlement built adjacent to an opponent’s settlement.
- **Rovers**: 1 gold per different sector built in during the turn.
- Evaluated after each settlement is built. Gold is recorded immediately and not scored again at endgame.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Moving Adjacent to Location**: Moving a settlement adjacent to a location hex allows tile collection.
- **City Hall**: Counts as 7 settlements. Can trigger Shepherds (if built on fully surrounded terrain) and Ambassadors.
- **Scouts (Red Card)**: Remove all terrain cards of one type at setup. Score 1 gold per settlement adjacent to the removed terrain.
- **Bazaar**: Can repeat most actions but not nomad actions, farmland actions, or cave actions. Cannot generate new scout meeples.
- **Ties**: Most scoring mechanisms allow ties (e.g., Lords, Palace, Workers) where all tied players receive full points.
- **Island Scoring**: Knights and Discoverers can score on the island; Lords and Farmers cannot.
- **Sword and Endgame**: Returning settlements via Sword does not prevent endgame if the trigger has already occurred.
