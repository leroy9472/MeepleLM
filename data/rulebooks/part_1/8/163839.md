### 1. Lore & Objective
In Feudum, players are banished nobles seeking to reclaim honor and become "most venerated in all the land" under Queen Anne’s watchful eye. The game simulates medieval life where players compete through strategic control of regions, guilds, and resources. The goal is to earn the most veneration points (vp) over five epochs by ruling locations, influencing guilds, completing objectives, and managing resources wisely.

### 3. Setup
1. Place board in center. Each player selects a color and takes:
   - 3 pawns
   - 4 player discs/reeves
   - 11 action cards
   - 7 influence markers
   - 7 food
   - 7 shillings
   - 1 player pouch
   - 1 reference card
   - Blank player disc placed on scoring track.

2. General Supply Setup:
   - Vessels: place 3 near Alchemist Guild.
   - Influence markers and monsters: near Knight Guild.
   - King's seals/rosary beads: near Noble Guild.
   - Shillings and archery targets: near board.

3. Shuffle Royal Writ cards and place face down. Create six stacks of region tiles in descending order. Remove feudum discs (12 total) and place in general supply. Shuffle remaining location discs and place circled ones on pink starting spaces; others on remaining map spaces. Turn all location discs face up.

4. Guild Resource Placement:
   - Farmer Guild: place goods as shown, leaving last space empty in saltpeter and sulfur rows.
   - Alchemist Guild: place goods as shown, leaving 2 spaces empty in food cart and 2 in sulfur bowl. Randomly draw 2 vessels and place in guild.

5. Place remaining goods into haversack. From general supply, place 2 influence markers per player in Knight Guild (use dummy rows if fewer than 4 players).

6. Shuffle 17 king's seals (red side up), draw 4 and place on scrolls in Noble Guild. Draw 4 more, flip to reveal rosary beads, place on rosary in Monk Guild. Draw 1 more, flip to reveal bead, place atop chicken in Farmer Guild. Randomly draw 10 goods from haversack and place in Farmer Guild barn.

7. Place epoch marker on Epoch I (first sunray). Randomly select 6 goods from haversack and place one beside each "N"-marked location in each region. Randomly select starting player and give them starting player marker and progress die.

8. In turn order, each player selects 3 different goods from haversack. If sulfur is chosen, decide whether to place in wine barrel (to nourish pawns) or personal supply (for sequential actions later).

9. In turn order, select character icon on one pawn, place it face up beside a starting location (pink circle). Immediately place influence marker from personal supply on 5vp hexagon in corresponding guild. If occupied, use 3vp hexagon.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each epoch consists of multiple rounds. A round has five steps:

**Step 1: Take Actions**
- All players secretly choose 4 out of 11 action cards.
- Optionally play saltpeter (for 5th card) or sulfur (for sequential play) by placing on pouch.
- Reveal and execute cards one at a time in turn order.

**Step 2: Nourish Pawns**
- Sustain pawns with food or wine (from barrel).
- Unnourished pawns return to personal supply.
- Adjust guild membership accordingly.

**Step 3: Roll Progress Die**
- Roll die to determine which region loses a tile.
- Remove top tile from matching region stack (must be current or former epoch).
- If no such tile exists, skip.

**Step 4: Advance Epoch Marker & Score Epoch (if triggered)**
- Trigger new epoch if:
  - Epoch II: 4 Epoch II tiles visible
  - Epoch III: 3 Epoch III tiles visible
  - Epoch IV: 2 Epoch IV tiles visible
  - Epoch V: 1 Epoch V tile visible
- Advance epoch marker.
- Score:
  - Guild Status: 1/3/5 vp
  - Landscapes: 2 vp (empty), 4 vp (with resources)
  - Active Regions: 1/3/5/7/9/11 vp
  - Subtract for Disloyalty (Epochs II, IV, V only): cumulative penalties for vassals without military service
- Replenish:
  - Landscapes: add 3 resources
  - Map (Epochs II–IV): place 1 good in southern/eastern/westernmost location per region
  - Guilds (Epoch III only): refill original setup positions

**Step 5: End Round or End Game & Final Scoring**
- Pass starting player marker clockwise.
- If Epoch V was triggered, end game after final epoch scoring.
- Perform final scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Action Cards (11 total)
1. **Migrate**: Add/remove pawn to/from board. Requires food to enter. "Distant Kin" (Alchemist in play): migrate to any starting location.
2. **Move**: Movement allowance = number of pawns on board. Can move multiple pawns. Pilfer 1 resource at end of move. "Godspeed" (Monk in play): +1 movement.
3. **Influence**: Add 1 influence marker per location with your pawn. Max 3 markers (2 players), max 2 per player. "Money is Influence" (Merchant in play): pay 1 shilling to displace lone ruler.
4. **Improve**: Upgrade location you rule:
   - Outpost → Farm (Wood)
   - Farm → Town (Iron)
   - Town → Feudum (King’s Seal)
   - Draw region tile from matching region (current or earlier epoch); score vp based on chart.
   - "Tend Landscape" (instead of improve): turn in Wood, place landscape tile with serf; score 2 vp.
5. **Explore**: Rule an outpost → draw 2 Royal Writ cards (+1 per additional outpost/feudum), keep 1. "Shovels & Swords": turn in Iron to draw 2 more, keep 1.
6. **Harvest**: Rule a farm → draw 5 goods (+1 per additional farm/feudum, +2 to +5 from rosary beads; max 10). Score 1 vp. Can take partial harvest ("favors") to personal supply. "Inspect the Harvest" (Farmer in play): choose favors.
7. **Tax**: Rule a town → collect 2 shillings (+1 per additional town/feudum). "Reinforcements" (Knight in play): gain 1 influence marker.
8. **Conquer**: Attack opponent’s pawn or feudum where you have presence. Cannot be last action. Attack > defense wins. "Starve the People" (Noble in play): remove subject/serf; no vp, but can advance military service.
9. **Defend**: Play out of turn when attacked → +1 defense, score 1 vp. "Royal Immunity": turn in Food to nullify "Starve the People" and gain king’s seal.
10. **Repeat**: Replay any action with (x2) symbol. "Déjà vu": turn in Saltpeter to replay non-(x2) action (except Conquer/Defend).
11. **Guild Action**: Interact with guild via:
    - Trade (any player)
    - Pull (Journeyman): score 3 vp + draw 1 Royal Writ
    - Push (Guild Master): score 4/5/6 vp based on success

#### Guild Mechanics
- **Membership**: Based on status stars:
  - Pawn in play: +1★
  - Feudum ruled: +3★
  - Location ruled: +1★ (only if primary criterion met)
- **Status**:
  - Guild Master (most stars): rightmost spot, scores 5 vp
  - Journeyman (second): middle, scores 3 vp
  - Apprentice (third, 4–5 players): leftmost, scores 1 vp
- **Trading Procedure**: Pay shillings in order: Guild Master → Journeyman → Charity (opposite side). Repeat for costs >3s.
- **Reeves (Advanced)**: Place 1 reeve when performing successful push/pull. Score +1 vp; +1 more if second reeve active elsewhere.

#### Special Actions & Bonuses
- **Extra Action**: Play saltpeter → draw 5th card.
- **Sequential Action**: Play sulfur → play two actions back-to-back.
- **Feast**: Turn in sulfur from barrel → perform another player’s push/pull function and score +3 vp.
- **Vessels**: Deploy from supply to pawn; move along special routes. Abandoned vessels can be used by others.
- **Monsters**: Control via 3 influence markers. Behemoth (roads/flying), Sea Serpent (ships/submersibles). Add to movement, pin opponents, can attack.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends when Epoch V is triggered. Final scoring includes:
- **Epic Voyage Track**: Score higher value in each section if leading or tied.
- **Large Empires**:
  - Outpost, Farm, Town: 1 vp each
  - Feudum: 3 vp
  - 3 identical locations (feudum wild): 3 vp
  - 3 shillings: 1 vp
  - Royal Writ Charters with King’s Seal: value per card
- **Tiebreaker**: Most sulfur in wine barrel. If still tied, share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Pilfering**: Only once per Move action, only from non-self locations.
- **Conquer**: Cannot target own units; must have presence; not last action.
- **Defend**: Can only be used once per round; if forced early, still scores 1 vp but no defense bonus.
- **Wine**: Sulfur in barrel nourishes pawn for 2 rounds; reduces defense/attack to 0 during first round.
- **Guild Push/Pull**: Must move full amount if space allows; cannot partially execute.
- **Reeves**: Only score during own push/pull; not during feasts.
- **Feudum Rulership**: Becomes vassal; must perform military service or suffer cumulative penalties.
- **Landscape Tending**: Only serfs can tend; counts toward active regions.
- **Royal Writs**: Max 3 held; mandates played anytime, charters require seal at end.
