## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In the year 2442, humanity has made contact with extraterrestrial civilizations. The universe is organized into federations, and one such federation with five member planets seeks a new delegation to join. Players represent competing delegations vying for prestige over 5 rounds (years). The goal is to become the most prestigious delegation by earning the most prestige points (PP). The player with the highest PP total at the end of the game wins and joins the Federation.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game lasts 5 rounds. Each round has two phases:

#### I. Ambassador Phase
- Players take 4 turns each (one per Ambassador), in clockwise order.
- Each turn:
  1. **Play 1 Ambassador Token (Mandatory):**
     - Place on an available Senate space.
     - Choose Funding or Voting side.
     - Optionally place an Alteration Token on it (replaces its stats).
     - Gain immediate bonus (crystals, Special Mission token, etc.).
     - Perform the action of the space.
  2. **Send 1 Spaceship on a Special Mission (Optional):**
     - If conditions are met, send a spaceship to complete a mission.

#### II. Executive Phase (End of Round)
All players perform in turn order:
1. Receive income from Production Structures (left to right).
2. Pay resource cost based on Accreditation level.
3. Fund Major Projects: Advance markers by number of Funding-side Ambassadors (top to bottom per column).
4. Score Senate Majorities: For each floor (1st, 2nd, 3rd), majority player scores PP equal to their Accreditation level.
5. Pass a Law: Wing (left/right) with most votes passes its law; players score PP based on law criteria.

Then:
- Retrieve Ambassador Tokens and Assistant Dice (keep die value).
- Discard used Alteration Tokens.
- Discard both Law Tiles (face-up nearby).
- Reveal next 2 Law Tiles (if possible; avoid duplicates).

In Round 4, reveal both Round 4 and Round 5 tiles simultaneously, ensuring no duplicate laws.
