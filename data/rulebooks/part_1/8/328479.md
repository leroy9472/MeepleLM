## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Living Forest*, players embody one of the four Spirits of Nature—Winter, Spring, Summer, and Autumn—tasked with saving the Sacred Tree from Onibi, the destructive spirit of fire. To earn the title of Grand Protector, a Spirit must be the first to fulfill one of three victory conditions by the end of a full game turn:  
- Plant **12 different Protective Trees** (including the starting tree and any Victory Tree tiles).  
- Collect **12 Sacred Flowers** (from cards, board elements, and Flower Victory tiles).  
- Extinguish **12 Fires** (counting Fire tiles collected, not their value, plus Fire Victory tiles).  

If multiple players meet a victory condition simultaneously, the winner is determined by summing the values of all three victory conditions. The player with the highest total wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Place the Circle of Spirits** in the center. Position Spirit standees clockwise from the starting rock based on player count (2, 3, or 4 players).  
2. Each player takes:  
   - 1 Forest board  
   - 14 starting Guardian Animal cards  
   - 1 Spirit standee  
   - 1 starting Protective Tree (place in center of board)  
   - 3 Victory tiles (Fire, Flower, Tree – place to the left of board)  
3. **Shuffle** your 14 starting cards into a face-down personal draw stack (right of board).  
4. **Form three level-based stacks** of Guardian Animal cards (Level 1, 2, 3). Shuffle each, place face down on the Guardian Animal board, and **reveal the top 4 cards per level** to form the reserve.  
5. **Sort Fire tiles** by value (2, 3, 4) and place on corresponding spaces next to the Guardian Animal board.  
6. Place **1 Fire tile of value 2** in the center of the Circle of Spirits.  
7. Assemble **Protective Tree dispensers** and load tiles in ascending order (left to right).  
   - **3 players**: Remove 1 Protective Tree each for values 3, 4, 5.  
   - **2 players**: Remove 2 each for values 3, 4, 5; 1 each for values 6, 7, 8.  
8. Place **Fire Varan board** next to Circle of Spirits. Stack **Fire Varan cards** and **Fragment tiles** on their spaces.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game turn has **three phases**:  
1. **Guardian Animals Phase** (simultaneous)  
2. **Action Phase** (turn order, clockwise from Sacred Tree holder)  
3. **End of Game Turn Phase** (simultaneous steps)

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Guardian Animals Phase  
- All players **simultaneously draw** from their personal stack to form a **Help Line** (face-up row).  
- You may **stop drawing at any time**.  
- If you reveal a **third solitary symbol (●)** that is **not canceled**, you **must stop**.  
- **Gregarious symbols (⊙) cancel solitary symbols (●)** one-for-one.  
  - Example: 4 ● and 2 ⊙ = net 2 ● → you may continue.  
- **Fire Varan cards** count as solitary (●) but provide **no Elements**.  
- At any point during drawing, you may **discard a Fragment tile** to:  
  - **Destroy a just-drawn Fire Varan** (return to stack).  
  - **Return a just-drawn Guardian Animal** to your discard stack.  
- If your draw stack is empty when drawing, **shuffle your discard pile** to form a new draw stack.  

#### Action Phase  
- Begins with the player holding the **Sacred Tree**, then proceeds clockwise.  
- Number of actions depends on **net solitary symbols** in Help Line:  
  - **0, 1, or 2 net solitary symbols (●)** → **2 different Actions**.  
  - **3 net solitary symbols (●)** → **1 Action only**.  
- **Action strength** = sum of relevant Elements from:  
  - Guardian Animal cards in Help Line  
  - Elements on your Forest board (from planted Trees)  

##### Available Actions:  
- **Take a Fragment tile**  
  - Take 1 Fragment tile and place next to your board.  
- **Attract one or more Guardian Animals**  
  - Pay with **Suns (☀)**.  
  - Take 1 or more cards from the reserve with total cost ≤ your ☀.  
  - Place taken cards **face down on top of your draw stack**.  
- **Extinguish the Fire**  
  - Pay with **Water (Δ)**.  
  - Remove Fire tiles from center with total value ≤ your Δ.  
  - Place extinguished tiles next to your board (face down).  
  - Collecting **12 Fire tiles** is a win condition.  
- **Move forward on the Circle of Spirits**  
  - Pay with **Spirals (⑥)**.  
  - Move clockwise up to your ⑥ value.  
  - **Jump over Spirits ahead** without counting their rocks.  
  - For each Spirit jumped, take **one Victory tile** of your choice from them.  
  - **Trigger bonus** of the rock you land on (must move at least 1 space).  
- **Plant one and only one Protective Tree**  
  - Pay with **Sprouts (☘)**.  
  - Take **one** Protective Tree tile with cost ≤ your ☘.  
  - Place it **adjacent** (orthogonally) to an existing Protective Tree.  
  - Diagonals do not count.  
  - **Immediate effects**:  
    - Tree’s Elements are **permanently active**.  
    - **Corner bonus**: Planting in a corner grants an **immediate extra Action**:  
      - Choose: **Attract Animals (+3 ☀ bonus)** or **Take 2 Fragment tiles**.  
    - **Row/Column Completion**: Completing a full row or column grants **+1 permanent Element** (type depends on row/column).  

> **Note**: If you plant a Protective Tree and are allowed **2 Actions**, this counts as performing **the same Action twice**.

#### End of Game Turn Phase  
1. **Onibi Attacks You!**  
   - Total value of Fires in center = **Onibi’s Firepower**.  
   - Each player totals their **Δ (Water)**.  
   - If **Δ < Firepower**, add **one Fire Varan card per Fire tile** in center to your discard stack.  
   - If insufficient Fire Varans: distribute evenly clockwise; excess is ignored.  
2. **Onibi Attacks the Sacred Tree!**  
   - For each **Guardian Animal card taken this turn**:  
     - Level 1 → add **Fire of value 2**  
     - Level 2 → add **Fire of value 3**  
     - Level 3 → add **Fire of value 4**  
   - **Max 7 Fires** in center at once.  
   - If **no Fires remain** after this step, add **1 Fire of value 2**.  
3. **Arrival of New Guardian Animals**  
   - Refill reserve: **Reveal new cards** per level equal to number taken this turn.  
4. **Return of Guardian Animals**  
   - Move all cards from your **Help Line** to your **discard stack**.  
5. **Giving the Sacred Tree**  
   - Pass the **Sacred Tree standee** to the next player clockwise.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends **after a full turn** if **any player** meets **one** of:  
  - **12 different Protective Trees** (including starting tree and Victory Tree tiles).  
  - **12 Sacred Flowers** (visible on Help Line, board, Flower Victory tiles).  
  - **12 Fire tiles** collected (count tiles, not values; includes Fire Victory tiles).  
- If **multiple players** meet a condition, **sum the values** of all three:  
  - Protective Trees: sum of tile values + Victory Tree value  
  - Sacred Flowers: number of Flowers × 1  
  - Fires: sum of extinguished Fire tile values + Fire Victory value  
- **Highest total wins**.
