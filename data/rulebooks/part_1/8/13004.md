## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *The Downfall of Pompeii*, players represent families settling in the city of Pompeii beneath Mount Vesuvius. The game unfolds in two phases:  
- **Phase I – New Citizens Move to Pompeii**: Players place family members into buildings across the city using cards.  
- **Phase II – Catastrophe – Run for Your Lives!**: After Vesuvius erupts, players attempt to escape as many of their citizens as possible through city gates before lava consumes the city.  

**Objective**: Save the most of your own citizens by moving them out of the city through gates. In case of a tie, the player with the fewest citizens in the volcano wins.

### 3. Setup  
#### Player Allocation  
- **2 players**: 36 markers each (Red, Black).  
- **3 players**: 30 markers each (Red, Black, Yellow).  
- **4 players**: 25 markers each (Red, Black, Yellow, Blue).  

Unused markers go into the box.

#### Deck Preparation  
1. Separate cards into three piles:  
   - 53 Pompeii cards  
   - 7 Omen cards  
   - 2 A.D. 79 cards  

2. Shuffle the 53 Pompeii cards. Set aside 28 of them into seven face-down piles of 4 cards each. Keep these aside.  

3. Take the remaining 25 Pompeii cards and shuffle in the 7 Omen cards → this forms the main deck base.  

4. Draw from this shuffled deck:  
   - **2 or 3 players**: 15 cards  
   - **4 players**: 10 cards  
   Shuffle one A.D. 79 card into this pile.  

5. Place the rest of the 25+7 deck (17 cards for 2/3P; 22 cards for 4P) on top of the above pile.  

6. Place the second A.D. 79 card on top of the entire deck.  

7. Place two of the pre-set 4-card piles on top of the deck.  

8. Deal one 4-card pile to each player. Discard remaining 4-card piles without looking.  

#### Board Setup  
- Place volcano over the central hole on the board.  
- Place all lava tiles into the cloth bag.  
- Starting player is chosen (often the player to the left of the dealer).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

#### Phase I: New Citizens Move to Pompeii  
On your turn, perform in order:  
1. **Play a card** from your hand.  
2. **Place 1 family member** on an unoccupied space in a building matching the card's number and color.  
3. **Draw a new card** from the top of the deck.  

##### Additional Rules After First A.D. 79 Card Is Drawn ("Vesuvius Seethes")  
Once the first A.D. 79 card is drawn and resolved:  
- The player who drew it immediately draws and plays the next card.  
- From now on, the following rules apply during Phase I:  

**Relative Rule**:  
- If there are *n* family members (any color) already in the building where you place your piece, you may place up to *n* additional members:  
  - In **different buildings of the same color**, or  
  - In **neutral buildings**.  
  - Maximum: 1 relative per building.  

**Wild Card Rule ("Joker")**:  
- If you cannot legally play a card (no free space in matching building), you may play it as a **wild card**.  
- Place 1 family member on **any unoccupied space in any building** (regardless of color).  
- **No relatives are triggered** by wild card placements.  

**Omen Cards**:  
- When you draw an Omen card:  
  1. Discard it.  
  2. Remove **one opponent's family member** from the board and place it in the volcano.  
  3. Draw another card (repeat if another Omen or A.D. 79 is drawn).  

#### End of Phase I: Vesuvius Erupts  
Triggered when the **second A.D. 79 card** is drawn:  
- All players immediately:  
  - Discard all remaining cards.  
  - Return all unused family members to the **box** (not the volcano).  
- Exception: A player holding **only wild cards** (i.e., no playable numbered cards due to full buildings) may **voluntarily declare "Vesuvius Erupts"** at any time, even during another player’s turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Phase II: Catastrophe – Run for Your Lives!  
After Vesuvius Erupts, Phase II begins.  

##### Initial Lava Flow  
- Starting with the player to the left of the one who drew the first A.D. 79 card, each player:  
  1. Draws a lava tile from the bag.  
  2. Places it adjacent (orthogonally) to an existing matching lava symbol.  
- Repeat until **6 lava tiles** have been placed.  

##### Turn Order in Phase II  
Each turn consists of:  
1. **Draw and place one lava tile**  
2. **Move up to two of your family members**

**Lava Tile Placement Rules**:  
- Must be placed **orthogonally adjacent** to another tile with the **same symbol**.  
- Cannot place diagonally.  
- If placed on a square with people: **all occupants die** and are placed in the volcano.  
- If lava **blocks all exits** from a section and surrounds citizens (with walls or lava), those citizens are **immediately killed** and placed in the volcano.

**Movement Rules**:  
- You must move **two different family members**, unless:  
  a) You have only **one** left in the city.  
  b) A **solitary** family member may move **twice**, but must be moved first.  
- Movement distance = **total number of people (any color)** on the starting square.  
  - Example: A square with 3 people (yours and others) allows a move of 3 spaces.  
- Movement is **orthogonal only** (no diagonals).  
- Exiting through a **gate counts as one movement point**.  
- Once a citizen exits, place them in front of you (safe zone).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Game End Conditions  
The game ends immediately when **any one** of the following occurs:  
- The **last lava tile** is placed.  
- All **exits are blocked** by lava/walls and no movement is possible.  
- There are **no citizens left alive** in the city.  

When the game ends:  
- Any remaining citizens in the city are **killed** and placed in the volcano.

#### Scoring  
- **Saved citizens**: Each of your family members who exited through a gate.  
- **Victims**: Those in the volcano (killed by lava, omens, or sacrifice).  

**Winner**:  
- Player with the **most saved citizens** wins.  
- **Tie-breaker**: Fewest victims (in volcano).  
- If still tied, **no winner** — both "languish in defeat."

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I place relatives in multiple buildings?**  
A: Yes, up to one relative per building, as long as they are same-color or neutral buildings.

**Q: Do relatives trigger more relatives?**  
A: No. Only the original placement triggers relatives.

**Q: Can I use a wild card if my building has space?**  
A: Yes, but it’s usually suboptimal — you lose the chance to bring in relatives.

**Q: What happens if I draw an Omen card during initial card draw after playing a card?**  
A: Resolve the Omen: remove an opponent’s piece, then draw again until you get a non-Omen, non-A.D. 79 card (unless second A.D. 79 is drawn).

**Q: Can I move through lava or walls?**  
A: No. Movement is blocked by lava and walls. You cannot enter or pass through occupied lava tiles.

**Q: Can I voluntarily end Phase I if I have playable cards?**  
A: No. Only players with **only wild cards** (no playable cards) may call "Vesuvius Erupts" early.

**Q: Do I have to use all movement?**  
A: No. You may stop movement before using all allowed spaces.

**Q: Can I re-enter the city after escaping?**  
A: No. Once a citizen exits, they are safe and cannot return.
