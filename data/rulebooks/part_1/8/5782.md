# Coloretto — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Coloretto is a card-drafting game where players collect colored cards to maximize their score. The goal is to strategically gather cards in a few colors while avoiding too many different ones. At the end of the game, only a limited number of color sets score positively; all others count negatively. The player with the highest total wins.

### 3. Setup  

#### For 3–5 Players:  
- Choose scoring method: brown (increasing returns) or gray (diminishing returns).  
- Remove one color entirely if playing with 3 players.  
- Place one brown row card per player in the center.  
- Each player takes one starting card of a different color and places it face-up in front of them.  
- Shuffle remaining cards. Count 15 cards from the bottom, place the "Last Round" card on top of them, then place the rest of the deck on top.  
- Determine starting player randomly.  

#### For 2 Players (Standard Variant):  
- Remove two full colors (all 9 cards each) from the game.  
- Use 3 green row cards instead of brown.  
- Each player takes **two** starting cards of different colors (and different from opponent’s).  
- Setup otherwise same as above.  

#### Optional 2-Player Variant (Jim C / ekted):  
- Use 4 row cards (source does not specify color).  
- Each player may take **2 rows per round** (one at a time).  
- Score **4 colors positively**, all others negatively.  

#### Optional 2-Player Variant (Manolo Vila):  
- Play as if with 4 players, including two ghost players.  
- Distribute 4 row cards. Real players sit adjacent; each controls a ghost partner opposite.  
- Castle token indicates turn order. When it reaches a ghost player, the real player opposite plays for them.  
- Scoring: individual (or optional team scoring at end).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

On a player’s turn, choose **one** action:  
**A. Draw and Place a Card**  
- Draw the top card from the deck.  
- Place it face-up next to any row card.  
- A row may contain **up to 3 cards** (limit defined by row card image in 2-player variant).  
- Cannot place if all rows are full (3 cards each); must take a row instead.  

**B. Take a Row**  
- Take **any row** that has **at least one card** next to the row card.  
- Collect all cards in that row plus the row card.  
- Place collected cards face-up in front of you.  
- If you take the **Golden Joker**, immediately draw and add one card to your collection.  
- Once you take a row, you are **out for the rest of the round**.  
- Your taken row card remains in front of you as a reminder.  

#### Round End  
- A round ends when **all players have taken a row**.  
- Return all row cards to the center.  
- The player who took the **last row** starts the next round.  

> **Special Rule**: If all but one player have taken a row, the last active player may continue drawing and placing cards (without limit) until they choose to take the final row.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Row Limits  
- Standard: max 3 cards per row.  
- 2-player with green row cards: limit depends on image on card (1, 2, or 3).  
- 2-player variant: when both players have taken a row, **the third row is discarded** (unused cards removed).  

#### Joker Use  
- Jokers are set aside when collected.  
- At game end, assign each Joker to any color.  
- Each Joker increases that color’s count by 1.  
- Golden Joker grants immediate +1 card when taken.  

#### +2 Cards  
- Each "+2" card is worth exactly **+2 points**, regardless of color or count.  
- Apply after color scoring.  

#### Scoring Tables  
- **Brown Side**: Increasing returns. More cards = higher per-card value (e.g., 6 cards = 21 pts).  
- **Gray Side**: Diminishing returns. After 3 cards, each additional card gives less (or negative) value.  
- No bonus points for more than 6 cards in any color.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End  
- When the **"Last Round" card is drawn**, the current round becomes the **final round**.  
- The card is set aside as a reminder.  
- The player who drew it draws a replacement card immediately.  
- Play continues normally until the round ends.  

#### Final Scoring  
Each player:  
1. Sort collected cards by color.  
2. Assign each Joker to a color (each can go to different color).  
3. Count cards in each color group.  
4. Score each color using chosen table (brown or gray).  
5. **Choose 3 colors** (or 4 in Jim C variant) to score **positively**.  
6. All other colors score **negatively**.  
7. Add **+2 points per "+2" card**.  
8. Total = final score.  

> Example: 6 green (21), 4 yellow (15), 3 red (6), 2 blue (-3), +2 card (+2) → Total: 41

#### Winning  
- Highest score wins.  
- No tiebreakers specified.
