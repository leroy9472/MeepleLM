## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Snowdonia*, players represent labor companies contributing to the construction of the Snowdon Mountain Railway in Wales. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by claiming ownership of track segments, station sections, fulfilling contracts, and advancing surveyors. Victory Points are scored for completed infrastructure, contract bonuses, owning Train #4 (Snowdon), and final surveyor placement.

### 2. Components  
- Game board showing railway route with Station and Track card positions  
- 8 Station Cards (yellow side for Snowdon route; blue for Ffestiniog variant)  
- 27 Track Cards (shovel side up at start)  
- Player pieces per color:  
  - 16 Ownership Cubes  
  - 4 Pawns (1 Surveyor, 3 Laborers)  
- Resource cubes:  
  - Orange: Iron Ore  
  - Gray: Stone  
  - Brown: Rubble  
  - Black: Coal  
- Steel Bars (black sticks)  
- Contract Cards (29 total)  
- Train Cards (7 total, 6 used per game)  
- Action Area Cards (A–G, player-count specific versions)  
- Weather Discs (Sun, Rain, Fog)  
- Work Rate Markers (Excavate and Lay Track)  
- Event Cubes (white) and Event Track  
- Supply Bag  
- Scorepads (implied)  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place board centrally. Each player takes all components in one color.  
2. Place:  
   - 1 player pawn on Llanberis as Surveyor  
   - 2 player pawns in personal supply (Laborers)  
   - 1 player pawn in Pub (Temporary Laborer)  
3. Place initial Stock Yard resources:  
   - 7 Iron Ore (orange), 4 Stone (gray), 1 Coal (black)  
4. Randomly select 6 of 7 Train Cards; place with train side up. Add Coal cubes as indicated.  
5. Place remaining Train Card aside (used later if needed).  
6. Place rubble on all Track Cards and Station excavation spaces as shown.  
7. Set Action Area Cards (A–G) based on player count.  
8. Place Work Rate Markers on “2” for both Excavate and Lay Track tracks.  
9. Shuffle Contract Deck:  
   - Remove cards 28 and 29 in 1P/2P games  
   - Reveal top 3 cards face-up in Site Office (Contract spaces 1–3)  
   - Place Weather Discs: middle card → middle weather slot, right card → right weather slot  
10. Randomly determine starting player; give them Train token (Start Player marker).  

**Player Count Adjustments:**  
- 2-player: Omit Station #2 (Waterfall)  
- 5-player: Add Station #4½ (The Passing Loop)  
- 1P/2P: Remove Contract Cards 28–29  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of five phases:  

#### Phase 1: Assign Laborers  
- Starting with the current Start Player, players take turns placing one Laborer on any available space in Action Areas A–F.  
- **Before placing first Laborer**, any player with a Train may spend:  
  - 1 Coal (or 2 Coal for Train #6) → take Temporary Laborer from Pub into supply for this round only.  
- Players continue placing Laborers clockwise until all are placed.  
- **Action G (Move Surveyor)** allows unlimited Laborers; no numbered spaces.  

#### Phase 2: Resolve Actions (A → G)  
Before resolving each Action Area, players may activate **Contract Cards** relevant to that action (starting with Start Player, clockwise). Each Contract Card can be used only once per game; tilt it to show used.  
Then resolve actions in order A–G. Within each area, resolve Laborers in numerical order (1, 2, etc.).  

**A: Stockyard**  
- Take 3 cubes from Stock Yard:  
  - Max 1 Coal per Laborer  
  - Valid combinations: any mix of Iron Ore, Stone, and up to 1 Coal  
- If Laborer is in last space: immediately take Start Player token (affects future Contract activation order).  

**B: Excavation**  
- Remove rubble = current Excavate Work Rate (modified by Trains/Contracts)  
- Remove from leftmost Track or Station with rubble  
- If you remove last rubble from a Station excavation space → place your Ownership Cube there  
- **When all rubble is removed from all cards**:  
  - Flip the unused 7th Train Card and place it over B → becomes new Build action (B-II)  

**C: Works (Foundry)**  
- Perform up to 3 conversions (any combination):  
  - 3 Iron Ore → 1 Steel Bar (from supply)  
  - 2 Rubble → 1 Stone (from bag; if none in bag, cannot convert)  
- Must make at least one conversion if able.  

**D: Lay Track**  
- Pay 1 Steel Bar per track laid  
- Flip leftmost fully-excavated Track Card and place your Ownership Cube  
- Number laid = min(available excavated tracks, Steel Bars, Lay Track Work Rate)  
- Must lay as much as possible; cannot withhold.  

**E: Build**  
Two options:  
- **Build on Station**:  
  - All Track Cards leading to the Station must be fully excavated (but not necessarily laid)  
  - Pay cost (Steel, Stone, Iron Ore) → place Ownership Cube on any unclaimed non-excavation site  
- **Buy a Train**:  
  - Only allowed after “Trains may now be bought” Event  
  - Pay Steel cost shown → take Train (and its Coal)  
  - **Only one Train allowed per player**  
  - Returning a Train: place it back in Train Yard; refill with Coal from bag if available  

**F: Site Office**  
- Take one face-up Contract Card → keep in play area (face up)  
- Unlimited holdings allowed  

**G: Move Surveyor**  
- Move your Surveyor pawn to the next Station toward Yr Wyddfa  
- Not blocked by unexcavated/unbuilt sections  
- Multiple Surveyors can occupy same Station  

#### Phase 3: Restock Contract Cards  
- Discard card in space #1 (face down)  
- Shift cards left; refill spaces 2 and 3 from deck  
- If deck runs out: shuffle discard pile into new deck  
- If no cards left to draw: weather remains sunny  

#### Phase 4: Check the Weather  
- Shift all Weather Discs left  
- Draw top Contract Card (unrevealed); place matching Weather Disc in rightmost slot  
- Current weather = disc on “!” space  
- Adjust Work Rate Markers:  
  - **Sun**: Excavate +2, Lay Track +1  
  - **Rain**: Excavate -1, Lay Track -1  
  - **Fog**: No change to markers, **but block B and D actions next round** (cover with fog tokens)  
- Return “!” weather disc to supply  

#### Phase 5: Restock Stock Yard  
- Draw cubes from bag:  
  - 2P: 6 cubes  
  - 3P: 9 cubes  
  - 4–5P: 12 cubes  
- Place non-white cubes in Stock Yard  
- For each **white Event Cube** drawn:  
  - Place on leftmost empty Event Track space  
  - Resolve Event immediately (in order):  
    1. **Shovel**: Excavate leftmost Work Rate piles of rubble (players gain rubble)  
    2. **Track**: Lay Work Rate number of tracks (leftmost, remove rubble)  
    3. **Building**: Block first incomplete Station with black disc (no further builds)  
    4. **Train**: Trains may now be purchased (E action unlocked)  
    5. **Train Maintenance**: Each player with a Train pays 1 Steel or discards Train  
       - Discarded Trains refilled with Coal from bag  
    6–10: Repeat effects; Events 4, 7, 10 → return 3 white cubes to bag after resolution

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Worker Placement**: Laborers assigned to actions; must resolve if possible  
- **Resource Conversion**: Iron → Steel (3:1), Rubble → Stone (2:1)  
- **Ownership**: Cubes placed on Tracks and Stations for scoring  
- **Contract Cards**: One-time-use abilities tied to actions; also provide endgame bonuses  
- **Weather**: Affects Work Rates and can block excavation/track laying  
- **Events**: Triggered by drawing white cubes; resolved immediately  
- **Trains**: Provide persistent abilities (e.g., Train #1 increases dig rate)  
- **Limited Ownership Cubes**: 16 per player; running out prevents claiming new sites  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Triggers (game ends after current round unless noted):**  
- A player lays the last Track Card → game ends after Phase 5  
- An Event lays the last Track Card → play one more full round, then end  
- **2P or Solo**: Game ends immediately when a player places their last Ownership Cube  

**Final Scoring:**  
1. **Ownership Markers**:  
   - Score VP shown on each Track Card and Station site with your cube  
2. **Contract Cards**:  
   - Each bonus uses unique resources/markers (no reuse)  
   - Examples:  
     - Excavate: return rubble from supply → score VP  
     - Track: move ownership cubes from tracks → score VP  
     - Station: move ownership cubes from stations → score VP  
     - Surveyor: score if surveyor reached indicated station  
   - Cannot score if requirements cannot be met  
3. **Train #4 (Snowdon)**: +9 VP  
4. **Surveyor Placement**: Score VP shown on final Station  

**Winner**: Highest total VP. **Tie**: All tied players win.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Running out of Ownership Cubes**:  
  - Cannot claim new sites; flip Track/Station but leave unowned  
  - Use rubble cube to mark unclaimable Station excavation site  
- **Contract Card Use**:  
  - Can be played even if no Laborer is in the action  
  - Fog blocks B and D actions → Contracts for B/D also blocked  
  - Card is used even if effect cannot be fully resolved  
- **Train Abilities**:  
  - Mostly optional; **Train #1 (LADAS)** dig bonus is mandatory  
  - Train #6 (Padarn): can only be used if someone used E action this round  
- **Event Resolution**:  
  - Always resolved immediately when cube is placed  
  - Not affected by weather (e.g., excavation events occur even in fog)  
- **Ffestiniog Variant**:  
  - Blue side of Station Cards  
  - Neutral surveyor alternates event direction  
  - Trains purchasable from start  
  - Different endgame and building rules
