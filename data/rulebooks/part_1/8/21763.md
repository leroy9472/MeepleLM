## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 1888, London’s Whitechapel district is shrouded in darkness as Jack the Ripper—impersonating one of eight investigators—evades capture. One player takes the role of **Mr. Jack**, secretly assuming the identity of one character, aiming to escape detection. The other player is the **Detective**, who must deduce Jack’s identity and apprehend him before time runs out.

**Win Conditions:**  
- **Mr. Jack wins** if:  
  - He escapes the district during a round when he is **invisible**,  
  - The Detective makes an **incorrect accusation**, or  
  - He survives until the end of the **8th round** without being correctly accused.  
- **The Detective wins** by making a **correct accusation**—moving a character onto the same hex as Jack’s character.

---

### 3. Setup  
1. **Board Positioning:**  
   - The **Detective** sits with the **yellow edge** of the board facing them.  
   - **Mr. Jack** sits opposite, with the **grey edge** facing them (board appears upside-down).  
2. **Place Components:**  
   - Place character tokens, gaslight tiles, police cordons, and manhole covers as shown in the official setup image (errata-corrected version).  
   - Place **4 characters visible**, **4 invisible** at start.  
   - All character tokens start with **"suspect" side up**.  
3. **Cards:**  
   - Shuffle the 8 **character cards** and place face-down beside the board.  
   - Shuffle the 8 **alibi cards** and place face-down beside the board.  
4. **Witness & Round Tracker:**  
   - Place the **Witness card** with **Visible side up**.  
   - Place the **round counter** on **Round 1** (closest to the Detective).  
5. **Mr. Jack’s Identity:**  
   - Mr. Jack draws **one alibi card**, secretly views it, and places it face-down in front of them. This character is Jack.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each of up to 8 rounds proceeds in this order:

#### I. Choose and Use Characters  
- **Odd Rounds (1, 3, 5, 7):**  
  1. Draw the top 4 character cards and place them face-up.  
  2. **Detective** chooses and plays one character.  
  3. **Jack** chooses and plays two characters (in any order).  
  4. **Detective** plays the last remaining character.  
- **Even Rounds (2, 4, 6, 8):**  
  1. Draw the remaining 4 character cards and place them face-up.  
  2. **Jack** chooses and plays one character.  
  3. **Detective** chooses and plays two characters.  
  4. **Jack** plays the last remaining character.  

After each character is used:  
- Move the token (at least 1 hex, unless Sir William Gull).  
- Use the character’s **special ability** if required.  
- Place the used character card **face-down**.  
- **Reshuffle** all 8 character cards **only after even rounds**.

#### II. Call for Witnesses (Determine Visibility)  
At the end of the round, Jack declares whether he is **Visible** or **Invisible** based on his current character’s position:

- **Visible** if:  
  - On a **lit hex** (adjacent to a lit gaslight or Watson’s beam), **OR**  
  - Adjacent to **any other character**.  
- **Invisible** if:  
  - On an **unlit hex** AND **not adjacent** to any character.

Then:  
- Flip the **Witness card** to match Jack’s status (Visible or Invisible).  
- **Eliminate suspects:**  
  - If **Visible**, all **invisible** characters are **innocent**.  
  - If **Invisible**, all **visible** characters are **innocent**.  
- Flip innocent tokens to their **"innocent" side**.  

> ⚠️ **Note**: Jack may attempt to **escape** in the next round **only if** currently **Invisible**.

#### III. Shut Off a Gaslight (Rounds 1–4 Only)  
- Remove the **numbered gaslight tile** matching the current round (e.g., remove #1 at end of Round 1).  
- No gaslights are turned off in Rounds 5–8.

#### IV. End of Round  
- Advance the **round counter** to the next position.  
- Begin the next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Movement Rules  
- Characters must move **at least 1 hex** (except Sir William Gull, who may use ability instead).  
- Movement uses **1 point per street hex** (including diagonal).  
- Characters may:  
  - Move through **occupied hexes**.  
  - Move through **open sewers** (1 movement point to enter/exit).  
  - **Not end movement** on an occupied hex unless making an **accusation**.  
- **Sewers:**  
  - Move from one **open manhole** to another for **1 movement point**.  
  - Cannot use sewers if manhole is **covered**.  
  - **Cannot stop** on a manhole unless making an accusation.

#### Obstacles  
- **Building, garden, gaslight plinth hexes** are **obstacle hexes**.  
- **Only Miss Stealthy** can move through obstacles during her movement.  
- All others must go around.

#### Character Abilities  
| Character | Movement | Ability | When Used | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Sherlock Holmes** | 1–3 | Draw top alibi card | After movement | Mandatory |
| **John H. Watson** | 1–3 | Shine lantern forward | After movement | Mandatory; illuminates characters in line of sight; **does not illuminate self** |
| **John Smith** | 1–3 | Move a lit gaslight tile to a dark gaslight hex | Before or after | Mandatory; tile cannot be reused once removed |
| **Inspector Lestrade** | 1–3 | Move one police cordon | Before or after | Mandatory; swaps blocked/unblocked exits |
| **Miss Stealthy** | 1–4 | Move through any hex | During movement | Optional; must end on street hex |
| **Sergeant Goodley** | 1–3 | Use whistle: 3 movement points to bring others closer | Before or after | Mandatory; movement must be **above ground**, **no special abilities**, **shorter path only** |
| **Sir William Gull** | 1–3 | Swap positions with any other character | Instead of moving | Optional |
| **Jeremy Bert** | 1–3 | Move one covered manhole tile to another open manhole | Before or after | Mandatory |

#### Special Rules  
- **Accusation:** Only the **Detective** may accuse by **moving a character onto Jack’s hex**.  
  - Accusation can only be made **during the character’s own activation**.  
  - Cannot accuse via another character’s ability (e.g., Goodley’s whistle).  
- **Escape:**  
  - Only **Jack** may attempt escape.  
  - Must be **invisible** at end of previous round.  
  - Must move Jack’s character through an **unblocked exit** into the dark grey area.  
  - Escape attempt occurs **during character movement** in the following round.  
- **Goodley’s Whistle:**  
  - 3 movement points distributed across one or more characters.  
  - Each moved character must end **closer to Goodley** (measured in street hexes).  
  - Movement must follow shortest path; no detours.  
  - **No sewer use**, **no special abilities**.  
- **Watson’s Lantern:**  
  - Line of sight blocked by **obstacles**.  
  - Direction chosen by player who **last moved Watson** (including via Goodley’s whistle).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when any of the following occurs:

1. **Detective makes a correct accusation** → **Detective wins**.  
2. **Detective makes an incorrect accusation** → **Jack wins**.  
3. **Jack escapes the district while invisible** → **Jack wins**.  
4. **End of Round 8 with no correct accusation** → **Jack wins**.  

> If both fail to achieve objectives by Round 8, **Jack wins**.

---

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you accuse using someone else’s ability?**  
  No. Accusation must be made by **moving the accusing character** onto Jack’s hex during their activation.

- **Can you move through a character?**  
  Yes, but cannot end movement there unless accusing.

- **Can Jack use Holmes to draw alibi cards?**  
  Yes. This removes a card from the deck, making it harder for the Detective to eliminate suspects.

- **Can you use sewers to move toward Goodley?**  
  No. Goodley’s whistle requires **above-ground movement only**.

- **Can a manhole open/close under a character?**  
  Yes. Characters do not fall in.

- **Can you enter/exit sewers under an occupied manhole?**  
  Yes, but cannot stop there unless accusing.

- **Can Jack escape in Round 1?**  
  No. First visibility check is at **end of Round 1**, so escape cannot occur until **Round 2 at earliest**.

- **Can characters be moved next to Abberline (expansion)?**  
  (Not in base game; expansion rules not included here.)
