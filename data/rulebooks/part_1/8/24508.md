## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   Taluva is a tile-placement and settlement-building game set on a volcanic island. The objective varies by player count:
   - **SoloPlay™ (1 player):** Achieve the highest possible score through strategic tile and structure placement, with victory tiers based on final score.
   - **2–4 players:** Be the first to complete all pieces of two types (Temples, Towers, Huts) for immediate victory, or have the most Temples at game end (Towers and Huts break ties).

2. **Components**  
   - 48 Volcano tiles (hexagonal, each with 3 terrain types including a volcano)
   - 12 Temples (3 per player in 4-player)
   - 8 Towers (2 per player)
   - 80 Huts (20 per player)
   - 4 player color sets
   - 4 overview cards (reference for tile placement and building rules)

3. **Setup**  
   - Shuffle all 48 Volcano tiles into a facedown stack.
   - Each player selects a color and places their Temples, Towers, and Huts in front of them.
   - First player places the initial Volcano tile in the center of the table (volcano orientation arbitrary).
   - Play proceeds clockwise.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   Each turn consists of two mandatory steps:
   - **Step 1:** Draw and place one Volcano tile.
   - **Step 2:** Place one or more building pieces (if possible).

   If a player cannot place any building piece, they are eliminated.

5. **Core Mechanics**  

   **A. Tile Placement (Step 1)**  
   - **Expand the landscape:** Place the tile adjacent to at least one existing tile. At least one terrain edge must match (no restriction on number of matches).
     - Gaps are allowed.
   - **Volcanic Eruption (stacking):** Place the tile directly on top of existing tiles.
     - The volcano on the new tile must be placed over an existing volcano.
     - The volcano must point in a different direction (no same orientation).
     - No free space may be left beneath the tile (must fully cover underlying tiles).
     - Huts under the tile are returned to the box.
     - **Cannot cover** Temples, Towers, or completely eliminate a Settlement (at least one building must remain).

   **B. Building Placement (Step 2)**  
   Choose exactly one of the following options (if all conditions are met and pieces are available):

   a) **Build a Hut (Start a Settlement)**  
      - Place 1 Hut on any empty level 1 non-volcano hex.
      - Cannot be adjacent to an existing Settlement of the same color.

   b) **Expand an Existing Settlement**  
      - Choose one of your Settlements and one terrain type (Jungle, Clearing, Sand, Rock, Lake).
      - Place 1 Hut per level on **every** adjacent hex of that terrain type.
        - Level 1 hex: 1 Hut
        - Level 2 hex: 2 Huts
        - Level 3+ hex: 3+ Huts (equal to level)
      - New huts must be adjacent to the existing Settlement.
      - Merging Settlements is allowed if terrain and adjacency rules are followed.

   c) **Build a Tower**  
      - Place 1 Tower on an empty non-volcano hex at level 3 or higher.
      - Must be adjacent to one of your Settlements.
      - Your Settlement may not already contain a Tower.

   d) **Build a Temple**  
      - Place 1 Temple on an empty non-volcano hex adjacent to one of your Settlements.
      - The Settlement must occupy at least 3 hexes.
      - Your Settlement may not already contain a Temple.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  

   **End Game Conditions**  
   The game ends immediately when:
   - All 48 Volcano tiles have been placed (regular end), OR
   - A player places all pieces of **two** types (Temples, Towers, Huts) — immediate victory.

   Eliminated players cannot win.

   **Scoring (for regular end):**  
   Winner is determined in this order:
   1. Most Temples built.
   2. Tie: most Towers.
   3. Still tied: most Huts built (includes those returned to the box).

   **SoloPlay™ Variant (Single Player Only)**  
   - Use standard Taluva rules with additional SoloPlay™ mechanics:
     - Draw stack: 10 tiles face-up, rest face-down.
     - After initial setup (7 tiles forming starting island), begin play.
     - On your turn:
       1. Draw a **facedown** tile.
       2. Place it legally (expand or erupt).
       3. Based on placement type, may earn **bonus tile draws**:
          - **Condition 1 (Penalty):** Match only 1 type on 1 side, or only at volcano → Remove 1 structure from supply (out of play).
          - **Condition 2:** Match 1 non-volcano type on 2 sides, or 2 types on 2 sides → No penalty, no bonus.
          - **Condition 3:** Match 2 types on 3+ sides → Draw 1 bonus tile (face-up or face-down), playable to level 2+ if valid.
          - **Condition 4:** Match 3 types on 3+ sides → Draw 1 bonus tile, playable to any level.
       4. Bonus tiles may trigger additional draws if they meet Condition 3/4.
       5. After all tile placements, proceed to structure placement.

   **SoloPlay™ Scoring**  
   Final score is sum of:
   - **Island Structure Awards:**
     - 3 identical unoccupied terrain in triangle: Rock (1), Lake (2)
     - 6 identical unoccupied terrain in triangle: Jungle (4), Clearing (5), Volcano (6), Sand (6), Rock (8), Lake (10)
     - Unoccupied level 3 tile: 3 points
     - Unoccupied level 4 tile: 8 points
   - **Settlement Scoring:**
     - Size (6+ hexes): 4 pts per settlement
     - Height: 2 pts per 2 huts on level 2; 6 pts per 3 huts on level 3; 12 pts per 4 huts on level 4
     - Like terrain: 1 pt (4 hexes), 2 pts (5), 4 pts (6+)
     - Terrain diversity: 1 pt (3 types), 2 pts (4), 5 pts (5)
     - Number of settlements (≥3 hexes): 0 (≤3), 2 (4), 5 (5), 10 (6), 18 (7)
   - **Remaining Tiles:**
     - 0: +10, 1–3: +5, 4–6: +2, 7–10: 0, 11: –1, 12: –2, 13+: –(tiles – 11)
     - Bonus: (faceup remaining – facedown remaining) ≥0 → add as points
   - **Complete Placement Award:** +5 if all structures placed
   - **Penalties:** –3 per unplaced/removed Temple or Tower; –1 per unplaced Hut (including removed)

   **Victory Ratings (Solo):**
   - 40–44: Victory
   - 45–49: Major Victory
   - 50–59: Complete Victory
   - 60+: Perfectly Played

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Can you cover your own huts?** Yes, during eruptions. They return to the box.
   - **Can two Settlements merge?** Yes, when expanding into adjacent terrain that connects them, as long as expansion rules are followed.
   - **Can a Settlement have multiple Temples/Towers?** No. Only one Temple and one Tower per Settlement.
   - **What defines a "complete" Settlement cover?** If all buildings of a Settlement are covered, it’s invalid. At least one must remain.
   - **Can you place a Temple on level 2?** Yes, as long as it’s adjacent to a ≥3-hex Settlement and empty.
   - **SoloPlay™: Can you use faceup tiles first?** No — first tile drawn must be facedown. Bonus tiles may be faceup.
   - **SoloPlay™: Do bonus draws stack?** Yes. Each qualifying placement grants a draw; third tile ends the chain.
