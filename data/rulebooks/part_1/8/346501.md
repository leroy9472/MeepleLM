### 1. Lore & Objective
Mille Fiori is a strategic tile-placement game set in the Venetian lagoon, where players compete to build the most successful glass-making dynasty by placing diamonds (tiles) on key areas of the island: Workshops, Residences, Townspeople, Trade, and Harbor. The goal is to score the most points through careful placement, chain bonuses, and strategic use of cards.

In the 2-player variant by Caipirinha, neutral diamonds pre-occupy parts of the board to simulate competition from a third party, increasing tactical depth and balancing first-player advantage.

### 2. Components
- Game board with five colored areas:  
  - Workshops (orange)  
  - Residences (purple)  
  - Townspeople (green: Nobili & Populi)  
  - Trade (light blue)  
  - Harbor (dark blue)  
- 100-card deck (with color, symbol, number, and scoring indicators)  
- Player materials per player:  
  - 27 diamonds (personal supply; 3 extra returned to box)  
  - 1 ship token  
  - 1 score marker  
- 30 neutral diamonds (unused player color)  
- Doge card  
- Scoring track  
- Card display area and discard pile

### 3. Setup
1. **Deck Preparation**:  
   - Shuffle the 100-card deck.  
   - Remove 40 random cards face down (do not reveal).  
   - Create a 60-card draw pile.

2. **Card Display**:  
   - Reveal 9 cards face-up next to the board (standard for 2 players).

3. **Neutral Diamond Placement**:  
   Place 30 neutral diamonds on specific board spaces as follows:  
   - **Harbor (6)**: Form fleets bottom to top: 3, 2, 1, 0, 0 ships.  
   - **Trade (4)**: Cover one commodity per fleet (ideally diagonal); bottom fleet (3 ships) remains empty.  
   - **Nobili (2)**: Cover space 2 (coin) and space 4 (cross) on the lowest level.  
   - **Populi (3)**: Cover space 1 (crawfish), 3 (fish), and 5 (shell) on the lowest level.  
   - **Residences (5)**: Cover positions 5, 10, 12, 16, 20 (starting from arrow).  
   - **Workshops (10)**:  
     - Row 1: Workshops 3, 4, 5  
     - Row 2: Workshops 1, 8  
     - Row 3: Workshops 1, 8  
     - Row 4: Workshops 3, 4, 5  

   > These neutral diamonds block placement, count toward fleet/commodity totals, act as substructure for Townspeople, and reduce available workshop spaces.

4. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player takes 27 diamonds, 1 ship (on start space), and score marker (on 0).  
   - Starting player is determined by "fullest glass" and takes Doge card.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of 5 turns:

1. **Deal**: Starting player deals 5 cards to each player from the draw pile.  
2. **Pass**: Players choose 1 card to keep, pass remaining 4 face-down to left neighbor.  
3. **Play**: Starting player plays their card, then others in clockwise order.  
4. **Repeat**: Pick up passed cards, choose 1, pass rest left — repeat until each player has played 4 cards.  
5. **Final Card**: After 4 turns, each player has 1 card left. Instead of passing:  
   - Place both remaining cards (from hand and passed) **face-up** in the card display.  
   - Then play your last card normally.  
6. **End Round**:  
   - Discard played card.  
   - Pass Doge card clockwise.  
   - Refill card display to 9 face-up cards if needed.  
   - New round begins.

> **Note**: In 2-player games, only 3 cards are played per player per round; the 2 unused cards go to the display.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Using a Card
Choose one of two actions:

**A. Place a Diamond** (by area):
- Play card to matching **color** area.
- Follow **symbol** and **placement rules** for that area.
- Score **instant points**, possibly earn **bonus points** or **extra card**.

**B. Alternative Move**:
- Use **number** on card to move ship along trade route.
- Card color/symbol ignored.
- Score points for landing on numbered spaces.
- Earn **extra card** if landing on bonus symbol.
- Card is discarded and removed from game.

#### Area-Specific Rules
**Workshops (Orange)**  
- **Place**: Any empty space matching card symbol.  
- **Instant Points**: 1 pt + 1 pt per connected own diamond.  
  - On **pigment space**: 2 pts + 2 pts per connected.  
- **Bonus**: Fill all 4 symbols → place bonus diamond (highest available) → score points once.  
- **Extra Card**: When third space around a ♣ is filled (by anyone) → immediate extra turn.

**Residences (Purple)**  
- **Place**: Next empty space in line (no skipping).  
- **Instant Points**: Value of space + values of connected same-color diamonds.  
- **Bonus**: Fill 4 different-numbered spaces → bonus diamond (once per game).  
- **Extra Card**: At 3 different values → extra turn. Again at 5 different values.

**Townspeople (Green)**  
Two separate pyramids: **Nobili** and **Populi**.  
- **Place**: Any empty space on matching-color pyramid.  
  - Bottom-up: upper level requires both lower adjacent spaces filled.  
  - Symbol on card need not match.  
- **Instant Points**:  
  - Level 1: 1 pt, Level 2: 3 pts, Level 3: 6 pts.  
  - Double if symbol matches.  
- **Triangle Bonus**: If placed diamond forms 2- or 3-level triangle, all players score again for diamonds in triangle (1 pt per level 1, 3 pts per level 2; never doubled).  
- **Bonus**: Fill all 3 symbols in one pyramid → bonus diamond (once per pyramid).  
- **Extra Card**: Fill any top-row space → immediate extra turn.

**Trade (Light Blue)**  
- **Place**: Empty space matching card symbol.  
- **Instant Points**:  
  - Commodity value = total filled spaces of that symbol.  
  - All players earn: (value) × (their diamonds in that commodity).  
- **Bonus**: Fill all 4 commodities → bonus diamond (once per game).  
- **Extra Card**: If **at least one opponent** has more diamonds in this commodity than you (after placement) → extra turn.

**Harbor (Blue)**  
- **Place**: Any empty ship space.  
- **Instant Points**: Only when **fleet completes** (all 3 spaces filled):  
  - Points per diamond = based on filled commodity spaces in same row:  
    - 1: 1 pt, 2: 3 pts, 3: 6 pts, 4: 10 pts.  
- **Move Ship**: Use card number to move ship on trade route.  
  - Score landing space value.  
  - **Extra Card**: If land on bonus symbol (including last space).  
  - Cannot move beyond end.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Game Ends When**:
- End of round in which draw pile is exhausted, OR  
- A player places their last personal diamond.

**Final Turns**:  
- If a player places their last diamond, all others get to play their final card.  
- If extra cards are granted, player may use the 3 reserve diamonds from the box.

**Final Scoring**:  
- All points from bonuses, placements, and completed fleets are totaled.  
- Player with highest score wins.  
- Tie: Shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Extra Cards**: Can chain multiple times if conditions are met repeatedly.  
- **Neutral Diamonds**:  
  - Count toward fleet completion (Harbor).  
  - Count toward commodity totals (Trade).  
  - Act as support for upper-level Townspeople (but not owned).  
  - Block Residences chain.  
  - Reduce available Workshop spaces.  
- **Card Removal**: Using a card for alternative move removes it from the pool — may prevent full area completion.  
- **No Cards in Display**: Cannot earn extra card if display is empty.  
- **Trade Bonuses**: Extra card triggers if **any** opponent scores more than you — even if not all do.  
- **Tie in Trade**: "More than you" required — tie does not trigger extra card.
