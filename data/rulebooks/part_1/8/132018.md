## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Players assume the roles of the leaders of the "Big Three" Allied powers (US, UK, USSR) during WWII. While cooperating to defeat the Axis, they also compete for postwar influence through political, military, and strategic maneuvering. The goal is to achieve the highest Victory Point (VP) total under complex endgame conditions that simulate geopolitical tensions. Victory may not go to the highest scorer if the margin is too large or if tiebreakers apply.

2. **Components**  
- Game board with Conference Table (central zero space, national tracks, leader chairs) and Military Display (European and Pacific Theaters, Front Tracks, Clandestine/Political Alignment areas)  
- 3 Player Decks: 21 Staff Cards + 1 Leader Card each (US has 2 Leaders: Roosevelt/Truman)  
- Conference Cards (30 total, one per turn)  
- Issue Chits: Directed Offensives, Conditional (Second Front, USSR Declares War), Pol/Mil, Theater Leadership, A-Bomb Research, Global Issues  
- Markers: Production, Offensive Support, Naval Support, Clandestine Network, Political Alignment, Front Markers, German Technology tokens  
- Dice: 1d10, 1d6  
- Conference Winner Markers, Pass Tokens, A-Bomb and Spy Markers  

3. **Setup**  
- Choose Scenario (e.g., Training uses Conferences 8–10).  
- Set board per scenario instructions.  
- Shuffle Staff Decks. On odd-numbered turns, shuffle all Staff decks before dealing.  
- Deal 7 Staff Cards and 1 Leader Card (face up, Active) to each player.  
- Place Front Markers at starting positions.  
- Reveal first Conference Card and resolve its effects.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Each turn (Conference) has 4 phases:  
1. **Agenda**  
2. **Meeting**  
3. **Decision**  
4. **War**  
After War Phase, check end conditions. If not met, proceed to next Conference.

5. **Core Mechanics**  

**Agenda Segment**  
1. Reveal and resolve Conference Card.  
2. Each player reveals one Staff Card simultaneously. Only Strength values count; ignore text.  
   - UK gains +1 Strength in this segment.  
3. Highest total wins: selects one Issue and places it on their track at a space equal to (Highest - Lowest) Staff values played.  
4. Starting with player to left of Agenda Winner, each player places 2 Issues into the center (Zero Space) of the table.

**Meeting Segment**  
- Begins with player to left of Agenda Winner; proceeds clockwise.  
- On your turn:  
  a. Play a Staff Card to advance an Issue toward your Leader’s Chair.  
     - Move number of spaces = Staff Card value ± modifiers (only if card text matches Issue).  
     - Roll for Chief of Staff’s value before selecting Issue.  
     - Cannot advance Issues already in a Leader’s Chair.  
     - Discard a Staff Card to play your Leader instead (Leader becomes Inactive).  
  b. Conditional Issues (Second Front, USSR Declares War) may stop at Zero Space even if movement remains.  
- After nomination:  
  - Each opponent, in clockwise order, may **Debate**:  
    - Play a card to move Issue toward their own chair.  
    - Receive a Pass Token (must use on next turn or lose it).  
    - Only one opponent may Debate per turn.  
    - USSR gains +1 Strength when Debating.  
    - Only a Leader may Debate another Leader.  
- Repeat until all players exhaust Staff Cards.  

**Tiebreaker Rules**  
- For ties in Agenda or Decision Segments:  
  a. Starting with Stalin, proceeding clockwise, players may spend Active Leader to choose winner. First to commit breaks tie.  
  b. If no Leader used, US breaks tie.  
- Applies to all ties unless otherwise specified.

**Decision Segment**  
1. **Production Allocation Order**:  
   a. Directed Offensives (2 Production each)  
   b. Conference Card Production Requirements  
   c. Remaining Production spent in any order:  
      - A-Bomb: +1 die modifier per Production spent (even if you didn’t win the issue)  
      - Pol/Mil Issues: Spend 1 Production to gain Clandestine/Political Alignment markers as shown (X/Y)  
      - Fronts: Buy Naval/Offensive Support at 1:1, place on any Front  
         - Theater Leader grants +1 Support in their theater  
         - Max 5 Naval Supports per theater box  
         - Cannot place in Surrendered Theater  
2. **Theater Leadership**:  
   a. Winner of Theater Leadership Issue places 2 Operational/Navy Supports in that theater.  
   b. If one player wins both Theater Leadership Issues: place additional 2 Supports anywhere.  
   c. Winner selects Theater Leader (US or UK).  
3. **A-Bomb Research**:  
   - Roll d6: advance US marker on 4–6.  
   - +1 per Production spent by any player.  
   - If USSR won the issue: automatically advance Soviet Spy marker one space (even past US marker).  
4. **Global Issues**:  
   - Winner moves one Global Issue pawn one space toward their chair (never back to neutral).  
   - Affects Political Alignment placement rules only.  
5. **Conditional Issues**:  
   - If "USSR Declares War" ends in center: place on Far East Front Entry Space.  
   - If "Second Front" ends in center: place on Western Front Entry Space.  

**War Phase**  
1. Each player gains 1 Clandestine Marker.  
2. **Clandestine Placement**:  
   - Order: Most to least markers.  
   - Max 2 per space; only one nation’s markers allowed.  
   - Can place where you have ≤1, or remove opponent 1:1 before placing.  
   - Unused markers are lost.  
3. **Political Alignment Placement**:  
   - Order: Most to least markers.  
   - Can only act in spaces with your Clandestine marker.  
   - Options:  
     a. Remove opponent marker (1:1 or 2:1)  
     b. Place your marker (max 1 per space)  
   - Subject to Global Issue restrictions.  
4. Deploy Axis forces per script/die roll.  
5. **Front Strength Calculation**:  
   - Strength = 2 × (Operational Support - Axis Forces) + 2  
6. **Advance Fronts**:  
   - Roll 1d10 ≤ Front Strength to advance one space.  
   - **Breakthrough**: If Strength ≥ 10, gain +1 DRM per point above 10.  
     - On modified roll ≥ 10, advance a second time (only if second space is not amphibious).  
   - **Amphibious Entry**: Requires 3 Naval Supports (5 for Normandy).  
   - **Kamikaze Spaces**: Lose 1 Naval Support upon entry.  
   - **Conditional Advances**:  
     - Far East Front → Manchuria only if "USSR Declares War" was in center.  
     - Western Front → Normandy only if "Second Front" was in center.  
   - **Advancing Effects**: Remove 1 Clandestine Marker per non-controlling player from spaces newly behind the Front.  
   - Do not advance in Surrendered Theaters.  
   - After rolls: remove all Offensive Supports and Axis units.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  

**Victory Conditions**  
- Game ends after 10th Conference or if both Germany and Japan surrender.  

**End Game Situations**:  
a) **Both Axis Surrendered and High - Low ≤ 20**: High Score wins.  
b) **Both Axis Surrendered and High - Low > 20**:  
   i. If High > (2nd + Low): High wins.  
   ii. Else: 2nd wins.  
c) **One or both Axis not surrendered**:  
   i. High Score: -5 VP  
   ii. 2nd Score: -3 VP  
   iii. Low Score: +5 VP  
   → Then High Score wins.  
d) **Tie for High Score**:  
   i. US tied and has A-Bomb → US wins.  
   ii. USSR tied and sole occupier of Germany → USSR wins.  
   iii. Otherwise → Churchill wins (even if not tied).

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Leader Use**: Can only be played by discarding a Staff Card. Becomes Inactive. Can still break ties later.  
- **Debating Leaders**: Only a Leader may Debate another Leader.  
- **Pass Tokens**: Must be used on next turn or lost. Allows skipping Nomination.  
- **Ties in Issue Count**: Player with most won Issues gets Conference Winner marker. Tiebreak per standard rule.  
- **Axis Surrender**: Entering Axis capital with a Front Marker causes surrender. Japan may also surrender via conditions (e.g., A-Bomb).  
- **Multiple Fronts into Germany/Japan**: Split defending Axis units evenly; resolve randomly if odd.
