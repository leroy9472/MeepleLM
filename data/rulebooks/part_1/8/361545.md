## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Lazax Empire has fallen after a bloody rebellion, leaving the galaxy fractured. Formerly oppressed races now seek to rebuild and expand their civilizations. Players represent one of the major races in the *Twilight Empire* universe, competing to become the dominant power in the galaxy through exploration, expansion, industrial development, and military strength.

The objective is to score the most **Victory Points (VPs)** by developing your civilization across four domains: Navigation, Expansion, Industry, and Military. The game ends when the final Stage V event card — “Throne Waits for Overlord” — is resolved. The player with the most VPs wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Mecatol Rex sheet (dual-sided: standard and AI for solo/duo play)  
- 24 Race cards  
- 25 Event cards (5 stages × 5 types, with duplicates at Stage V)  
- 12 Quest cards (3 per type: Navigation, Expansion, Industry, Military)  
- 16 Relic cards  
- 12 Policy cards (Phases II–IV)  
- 1 Speaker card  
- 8 Help cards  
- 8 Dry-erase markers  
- 3 Black dice  
- 3 Intensification dice (red, marked with symbols for AI tracking)

Sheets:  
- 4 Player sheet types (1 each per player):  
  - Navigation Sheet  
  - Expansion Sheet  
  - Industry Sheet  
  - Military Sheet  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Player Sheets**:  
   - Distribute one random sheet of each type (Navigation, Expansion, Industry, Military) to each player.  
   - Players may choose side A (asymmetrical abilities) or side B (symmetrical, balanced).  
   - Arrange sheets in front of each player (recommended clockwise: Navigation → Expansion → Industry → Military).  

2. **Race Selection**:  
   - Shuffle race cards; deal 3 to each player.  
   - Each player selects one race, returns the others to the box.  
   - Resolve any setup effects on the chosen race card immediately.

3. **Mecatol Rex Sheet**:  
   - Place in the center.  
   - For 1–2 players: Use the **AI side** (SI mode).  
   - For 3+ players: Use the standard side.  
     - Shuffle Phase II, III, and IV Policy cards separately.  
     - Place one random card from each phase face-down behind the Mecatol Rex sheet (Phases II–IV). Return the rest to the box.  

4. **Event Deck**:  
   - Sort Event cards by stage (I to V) and suit (blue/black).  
   - Create 10 face-down piles: 2 per stage (blue and black). Shuffle each pile.  
   - Stack piles with Stage V on the bottom, alternating blue/black within each stage (blue at bottom).  
   - Combine into one deck: Stage V (bottom) → Stage I (top).  
   - Place next to Mecatol Rex sheet.

5. **Quest Cards**:  
   - Sort by type (Navigation, Expansion, Industry, Military).  
   - Shuffle each type.  
   - Draw one of each type and place face-up above Mecatol Rex sheet, showing both VP values (lower one active initially).  
   - Return the rest to the box.

6. **Relic Deck**:  
   - Shuffle all 16 Relic cards.  
   - Place face-down next to Mecatol Rex sheet.

7. **Other Elements**:  
   - Place dice (3 black, 3 red intensification) near Mecatol Rex.  
   - Give each player 1 Help card and 1 Dry-erase marker.  
   - Assign Speaker card to the most experienced player.

8. **1-Player & 2-Player Game Adjustments**:  
   - Use **AI side** of Mecatol Rex sheet.  
   - Place **all** Policy decks (II–IV) below Mecatol Rex (not just one card).  
   - In 2-player games: Roll 1 black die to determine neighbor relationships:  
     - Roll 1–3: Both players are left neighbors to each other.  
     - Roll 4–6: Neighbors follow clockwise order.  
   - Choose AI difficulty:  
     - **Easy**: No changes.  
     - **Medium**: Cross out leftmost symbol on each Objective Track; cross out leftmost undeleted symbol in Stage II and III on Power (-) track.  
     - **Hard**: Cross out first 2 symbols on each Objective Track; cross out leftmost undeleted symbols in Stage II and III on both Power (-) and Votes (-) tracks.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds. Each round follows these steps:

1. **Speaker reveals** the top card of the Event deck.  
2. **Reads the card aloud** and resolves its effect.  
3. Players follow instructions **simultaneously**.  
4. Card is placed in a discard pile next to the deck.  
5. Next round begins.  

Game ends after resolving the Stage V card: **“Throne Waits for Overlord”**.

#### Event Card Types:  
- **Strategy**: Roll dice, gain resources, spend on active sheet.  
- **War**: Resolve combat against neighbors.  
- **Council**: Vote on policy cards.  
- **Production**: Gain trade goods or other resources.  
- **Game End**: Final round trigger.

After resolving the event, players may:
- Claim completed objectives (Quest cards).  
- Activate technologies.  
- Announce Mecatol Rex capture.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Resources  
Three types:  
- **Raw Materials (-)**  
- **Influence (-)**  
- **Research (-)**  

Spent to place markings on sheets. Gained via dice, cards, or abilities.

#### Active Sheet  
During Strategy events, each player chooses **one sheet** as active. Only the active sheet can receive resource-based markings (except capital spending or special effects).

#### Capitals  
Symbols surrounded by dots or dashes. Represent achievements. Types:  
- **Punctual Capital**: Immediate effect when earned.  
- **Dashed Capital**: Can be spent during the same step it’s earned.  
- Capitals can be spent on **any sheet**, even inactive ones.

#### Intensification Dice  
Red dice used in solo/duo mode to track AI progress. Symbols correspond to AI Objective Tracks.

#### Marking & Erasing  
- Use dry-erase markers.  
- Shake markers for 20 seconds before first use.  
- Let ink dry 10 seconds before erasing to prevent smudging.  
- Clean sheets with dry or slightly damp paper towels.

#### Player Interaction  
- Players **cannot look at others’ sheets** during active marking phases.  
- Interaction occurs via war (Military), voting (Council), and indirect competition.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after resolving **“Throne Waits for Overlord”** (Stage V). Final scoring:

1. **Score each sheet**:  
   - **Navigation**: VPs from systems explored + completed Navigation Quest.  
   - **Expansion**: VPs from planets and structures + completed Expansion Quest.  
   - **Industry**: VPs from trade goods and network connections + completed Industry Quest.  
     - Bonus: 1 VP for every 2 unspent Trade Goods (-).  
   - **Military**: VPs from units, conflicts, and bonuses (can be negative) + completed Military Quest.  

2. **Add all sheet totals** for final score.  

3. **Speaker records scores** on Mecatol Rex sheet. If a race isn’t listed, add it (no reward for category).  

4. **Winning**:  
   - Highest score wins.  
   - **Tiebreaker**: Most unspent **Votes (-)**.  
   - If still tied: Players form an alliance and **share victory**.

#### Solo/Duo Win Condition:  
- Player must exceed the **“Defeat” threshold** for selected difficulty:  

| Difficulty | Defeat Threshold |  
|----------|------------------|  
| Easy     | 40               |  
| Medium   | 60               |  
| Hard     | 80               |  

Winning scores:  
- **80+**: Emerging Power  
- **100+**: Dominant Civilization  
- **120+**: More Powerful than the Lazax  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Capital Spending**: Dashed capitals can be spent immediately upon acquisition.  
- **Mecatol Rex Capture**: Announce anytime before next round. Can be delayed strategically.  
- **Sheet Viewing**: Players may only view others’ sheets **after all have finished marking** and placed markers down.  
- **Forgotten Claims**: Can be announced later; treated as claimed at time of announcement.  
- **Tech Unlocking**: Technologies can be used in the same round they are unlocked.  
- **Card Effects vs. Rules**: Card effects override standard rules.  
- **Optional Effects**: If a card says “may,” the player chooses whether to resolve it.  
- **Partial Tech Completion**: Building units or techs can span rounds. No refunds if alternate path unlocks.  
- **War Events**:  
  - Each player fights **left and right neighbors**.  
  - Strength is calculated per section below deployment line.  
  - Bonuses (e.g., +1) can be tracked in power boxes.  
  - Units must be orthogonally adjacent to deployment line or another unit.  
  - If a unit cannot be placed after build, it still grants its capital.  
- **Relics**: Kept hidden until played.  
- **Council Voting (Tie)**: Tied players roll black die; highest “C” symbol (material icon) wins. Repeat until one winner.
