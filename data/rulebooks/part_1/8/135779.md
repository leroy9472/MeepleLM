## A FAKE ARTIST GOES TO NEW YORK — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
A hidden role drawing game where one player — the Fake Artist — does not know the word being drawn. All other players (Artists) know the word and collaborate to draw it. The goal for the Artists is to complete the drawing well enough to reveal the word to everyone except the Fake Artist, while disguising their knowledge so the Fake cannot guess it. The Fake Artist must blend in and avoid detection. The GM oversees the game and supports the Fake Artist.

- **Objective for the Artists**: Identify the Fake Artist through voting, or have the Fake Artist fail to guess the correct word if revealed.
- **Objective for the Fake Artist & GM**: Avoid being identified, or correctly guess the word if voted out.

2. Components  
- Title Cards (one per player)
- Black marker (for GM)
- Coloured markers (one per Artist)
- Word list or category bank (implied by rules)

3. Setup  
1. Assign Roles:  
   - One player is the Game Master (GM), receives the black marker.  
   - All others are Artists, each receive a coloured marker.  
2. GM draws one Title Card per player.  
3. GM selects a category and announces it to all players.  
4. GM selects a specific word from that category to be drawn.  
5. GM writes:  
   - An "X" on one Title Card (secretly marks the Fake Artist).  
   - The chosen word on all other Title Cards.  
6. GM randomly distributes the Title Cards face down.  
   - The player who receives the card with the "X" is the Fake Artist and does not know the word.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. GM chooses the starting player.  
2. Players take turns in clockwise order, each adding **one continuous line** to the shared drawing.  
   - A line may be curved, jagged, or form a loop.  
   - It must be drawn in one stroke (no lifting the marker).  
3. Play proceeds for **two full rounds** (i.e., each player draws once per round).  
4. After the second round, drawing ends.  
5. All players examine the completed drawing.  
6. GM conducts a vote:  
   - GM counts down aloud (e.g., “3… 2… 1…”).  
   - On “1”, all players simultaneously point at who they believe is the Fake Artist.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Line Drawing Rule**: Each turn, a player adds exactly one continuous line to the drawing. No writing letters or numbers.  
- **Knowledge Asymmetry**: Only the Fake Artist does not know the word. All Artists know the word from the start.  
- **Bluffing & Detection**:  
   - Artists must draw cooperatively but subtly, avoiding giving away clues to the Fake.  
   - The Fake Artist must mimic artistic behavior and avoid drawing anything inconsistent.  
- **Voting**:  
   - All players vote by pointing.  
   - GM observes but does not vote.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
After voting:  
- If the Fake Artist receives **fewest votes (not most or joint most)**:  
  → **Fake Artist and GM win**.  
- If the Fake Artist receives **most or joint most votes**:  
  → The Fake Artist must **guess the word**.  
    - If the guess is **correct** → **Fake Artist and GM win**.  
    - If the guess is **incorrect** → **Artists win**.  

There are no points; the game is won/lost per round.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What if there's a tie in votes, and the Fake is among the top?**  
  → Since the Fake has joint most votes, they must guess the word.  
- **Can the GM help the Fake Artist during drawing?**  
  → No. The GM only sets up and observes. No in-game communication is allowed.  
- **Can Artists signal each other?**  
  → No. Only the drawing is allowed as communication. Talking or signaling is against the spirit of the game.  
- **Can a line be a dot?**  
  → No. A line must be continuous and visible — a dot is not sufficient.  
- **What if the drawing reveals the word too early?**  
  → The game continues. The Fake may use this to their advantage.
