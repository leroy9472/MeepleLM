### 1. Lore & Objective
In the world of Vigil, the dimensional barrier has failed, allowing Samael, the Fallen God, to return with an army of monsters. Players take on the role of champions defending Vigil by acquiring powerful Heroes and Constructs, defeating Monsters, and earning Honor. The player with the most Honor at the end of the game wins and earns the title of Godslayer.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Start Turn**: (First turn only) Place ship on any ship space (Skulls & Sails/Curse of the Golden Isles).
2. **Main Phase**:
   - Play cards from hand to generate Runes, Power, Energy, Insight, Crew, or Keystones.
   - Acquire Heroes/Constructs from Center Row or Always Available piles using Runes.
   - Defeat Monsters using Power to gain rewards (usually Honor).
   - Use Construct abilities.
   - Spend Insight to:
     - Acquire cards from Dreamscape
     - Roll Delirium Die (costs 5 Insight)
     - Bid in Fate Auctions
     - Pay Dreambind costs
   - Spend Energy to activate Energize effects.
   - Spend Keystones to gain/activate Temples.
   - Spend Crew to acquire/defeat cards on ship's space.
   - Use Phantom ability to play cards directly from Center Row by paying Insight cost.
   - Use Reputation to gain rewards from Champion board.
   - Move ship once per turn to adjacent space (Skulls & Sails/Curse of the Golden Isles).
3. **End Turn**:
   - Place played Heroes and remaining hand cards into discard pile.
   - Banish unused Soul Gems.
   - Draw 5 cards from personal deck (reshuffle discard if needed).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Runes**: Primary resource for acquiring Heroes and Constructs. Generated by Heroes and Constructs.
- **Power**: Primary resource for defeating Monsters. Generated by Heroes and Constructs.
- **Acquiring Cards**: Spend Runes equal to card's cost. Card goes to discard pile. Replace card in Center Row immediately.
- **Defeating Monsters**: Spend Power equal to Monster's cost. Gain rewards (Honor, effects). Monster goes to Void. Replace card in Center Row immediately.
- **Cultist**: Always available to defeat. Never banished to Void. Can be defeated multiple times per turn. Grants 1 Honor each time.
- **Banishing**: Remove cards from game. Cards from hand/discard go to Void. Cards from Center Row are replaced immediately.
- **Center Row Replacement**: When any card leaves Center Row, it is immediately replaced from Center Deck before any other effects resolve.
- **Deck Management**: Weak cards (Apprentice, Militia) can be banished to improve deck consistency. All acquired cards count toward final Honor.
- **Resource Persistence**: Insight is retained between turns. Energy, Runes, and Power are lost at end of turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End**: When the final Honor token is taken from the supply, the game continues until all players have had the same number of turns. The last player to start gets the final turn.
- **Scoring**:
  - Honor tokens collected during game
  - Honor value of all cards in deck (hand, deck, discard, Constructs in play)
  - Cursed Treasure: 2 Honor each
  - Temples: Honor value on card
  - Trophies: Honor value on card
- **Winning**: Player with highest total Honor wins. Tiebreaker: last player to start wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Center Deck Empty**: Shuffle Void pile to form new Center Deck. Remove Apprentice, Militia, Mystic, and Heavy Infantry cards when they appear.
- **Cultist**: Can be defeated multiple times per turn. Remains in play permanently.
- **Tablet of Time's Dawn**: Grants additional turn when banished while in play. Works even on final turn of game.
- **Runic Lycanthrope**: Does not count itself for its own effect ("If you played another Lifebound Hero this turn").
- **Druids of the Stone Circle/Arha Templar**: Cannot be combined with other cards; used alone to acquire/defeat cards.
- **Card Supply Depletion**: When Heavy Infantry or Mystic piles are exhausted, no more can be acquired.
- **Apprentice + Void Initiate**: Cannot use Apprentice's effect and banish it the same turn; card must be in hand to banish.
- **Xeron, Duke of Lies**: When defeated, player takes one random card from each opponent's hand. Opponents do not draw replacements.
- **Banishing vs. Defeating**: Defeating grants rewards; simple banishing does not.
- **Banishing from Hand**: Can only banish cards still in hand; cannot banish cards already played.
- **Deck Banishment**: Improves deck consistency but loses Honor value of banished cards.
- **Burrower Mark II**: Can be returned to hand after acquisition, as acquisition happens before Reclamax effect resolves.
