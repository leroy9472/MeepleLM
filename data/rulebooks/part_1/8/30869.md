## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Thebes, 2–4 European archaeologists in the early 20th century travel across Europe and the Mediterranean to gain knowledge, hire assistants, and excavate ancient sites in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Palestine, Crete, and Greece. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VP) by discovering valuable artifacts, mounting exhibitions, attending congresses, and achieving expertise in ancient civilizations.

Victory points are earned through:
- Artifacts collected during excavations
- Exhibition cards completed
- Congress cards owned
- Specialized knowledge majorities (5 VP for most in a region; 3 VP each if tied)

The player with the most VP at the end of the game wins. In case of a tie, there is no tiebreaker.

2. Components  
- 1 Game board showing 7 European cities (Warsaw, Berlin, London, Moscow, Paris, Rome, Vienna) and 5 excavation sites (Egypt, Mesopotamia, Palestine, Crete, Greece), connected by roads
- 4 Archaeologist meeples (in 4 colors)
- 4 Time markers (in matching colors)
- 1 Year marker
- 85 Researcher cards, including:
  - Technical Books (45 total, 9 per region)
  - Assistants (6)
  - Shovels (6)
  - Cars (2)
  - Zeppelins (2)
  - Local Legends (5, 1 per region)
  - General Knowledge (8)
  - Special Excavation (2)
  - Congress cards (9)
- 10 Exhibition cards:
  - 5 Small Exhibits: require 3 artifacts from 2 regions, worth 4 VP, take 3 weeks
  - 5 Large Exhibits: require 6 artifacts from 3 regions, worth 5 VP, take 4 weeks
- 4 Sets of excavation permits (5 per set, one per region)
- 155 Excavation tokens (31 per region):
  - 13 Artifacts (varying VP values)
  - 1 Technical Book (of another region)
  - 1 General Knowledge token
  - 16 Debris tokens (worthless)
- 5 Cloth bags (one per excavation region)
- 4 Time wheels (double-sided dials to determine excavation yield)
- 5 Summary cards (showing artifact distribution per region)

3. Setup  
- Place the year marker:
  - 2–3 players: on 1901
  - 4 players: on 1902
- Place 1 VP artifact token on each of the 5 excavation sites (awarded to the first player to dig there).
- Each player selects a color and takes:
  - 1 archaeologist meeple
  - 1 time marker
  - 1 time wheel
  - 1 set of 5 excavation permits
- Place all archaeologists on Warsaw.
- Stack time markers on the start space (Week 0). For 3 players, start at Week 16.
- Prepare researcher card supply:
  - Remove 10 exhibition cards from the deck.
  - Shuffle the remaining 75 cards.
  - Draw 4 and place face-up in the research area.
  - Divide the remaining cards into 3 stacks of 27:
    - Stack 1: 27 cards
    - Stack 2: 27 cards + 5 small exhibition cards (shuffled in)
    - Stack 3: 27 cards + 5 large exhibition cards (shuffled in)
  - Place Stack 1 on top of Stack 2 to form the draw deck.
  - Set Stack 3 aside for later use.
- Place exhibition card display with 3 spaces (a, b, c).
- Fill each colored cloth bag with 14 excavation tokens (excluding 1 VP token placed on the board) and 16 debris tokens.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Turn order: The player with the lowest time marker (furthest behind) takes the next turn. In case of a tie, the player whose marker is on top of the stack goes first.
- On a turn, a player:
  1. May move their archaeologist along roads (1 week per space).
  2. Must perform exactly one action.
  3. Pays time for movement and action.
  4. Advances their time marker accordingly.
- Actions (choose one per turn):
  - Take a Researcher Card
  - Exchange the Research Card Display
  - Perform an Excavation (Dig)
  - Attend an Exhibition
- After each action, refill the research card display if a card was taken.
- When a player's time marker passes Week 52, they immediately flip all excavation permits back to the valid side. When all players pass Week 52, advance the year marker.

5. Core Mechanics  
Take a Researcher Card:
- Move to the city shown on any face-up card.
- Take the card and place it in your play area.
- Pay time for movement and card cost (shown on card).
- Draw a replacement card from the deck.
- If an exhibition card is drawn, place it in space (a) of the exhibition display, shifting others down; discard if space (c) is pushed off.

Exchange Research Card Display:
- Must be in Warsaw.
- Discard all 4 face-up researcher cards.
- Draw 4 new cards from the deck.
- Pay 1 week for the action + movement time.
- Each consecutive exchange (without other players acting) costs +2, +3, etc. weeks.

Excavate:
- Must be at the excavation site.
- Must have a valid permit for the site.
- Must have at least 1 point of specialized knowledge (technical book or legend) for the site.
- Calculate Total Knowledge:
  - Special Knowledge: technical books + legends (color-matched) + assistants
    - 2 assistants = +1; 3 assistants = +2; 1 assistant = +1 (discard after use)
  - General Knowledge: up to the amount of special knowledge used
- Set time wheel to Total Knowledge (max 12).
- Choose number of digging weeks (black number) such that red number (tokens drawn) > 0.
- Pay time for travel and digging.
- Draw tokens from the site’s bag.
- Return debris to bag; keep artifacts and knowledge tokens.
- Flip permit to “X” side (used).
- First dig at a site: claim the 1 VP token on the board.
- Special Excavation card allows a second dig in the same year (discard after use).
- Shovel bonuses:
  - 2 shovels: +1 token
  - 3 shovels: +2 tokens
  - 1 shovel: use to draw +1 token (discard after use)

Attend an Exhibition:
- Must be in the city shown on an exhibition card.
- Must have the required artifacts (quantity and regions; values don’t matter).
- Books and knowledge tokens cannot be used as artifacts.
- Pay time for movement and exhibition duration.
- Take the exhibition card (worth VP).
- Keep the artifacts.

Card Supply Refill:
- When the deck is exhausted the first time, shuffle discards with Stack 3 to form a new deck.
- Subsequent exhaustion: shuffle discards only.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game End:
- Game ends when all players have passed Week 52 in 1903 and moved to Week 1 of the next year (cannot act further).
- Players may voluntarily end by moving directly to Week 1 in 1903.

Final Scoring:
- Artifacts: sum VP values of all collected artifacts.
- Exhibitions: 4 VP per small, 5 VP per large.
- Congress Cards: score based on number owned:
  - 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 6, 4: 10, 5: 15, 6: 21, 7+: 28 max
- Specialized Knowledge Majorities:
  - For each region, 5 VP to player(s) with most technical books.
  - Tie: each tied player gets 3 VP.
  - Only technical books and found book tokens count (not legends, assistants, or general knowledge).

Total all VP. Highest score wins. No tiebreaker.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I move without acting? No. A player must perform one action per turn.
- Can I look in the excavation bags? No. Bags are never examined.
- Do I lose knowledge if I discard a card? No. Knowledge from cards is retained as long as the card is in play.
- Can I use general knowledge without special knowledge? No. General knowledge cannot exceed special knowledge used in a dig.
- Can I use a shovel after starting to draw? Yes, as long as only one shovel is held, it may be discarded during the draw to gain +1 token.
- Can I re-excavate the same site in one year? Only with a Special Excavation card (allows second dig; discard after use).
- What happens when year marker advances? All players flip their permits to valid side when they pass Week 52. The year advances only when the last player passes 52.
- Can multiple players occupy the same space? Yes. No blocking or interaction.
- Travel with Car/Zeppelin:
  - Car: reduces any move of 3+ weeks by 1 week (permanent).
  - Zeppelin: reduces one move to 0 weeks (single use, discard after).
