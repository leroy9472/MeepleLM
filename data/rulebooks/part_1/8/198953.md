**Objective**: Be the first to meet the conditions of an active Victory Card by taking a Victory Action on your turn. If no player achieves this, the game ends when both draw decks are exhausted, and the player with the most Patron Prestige wins (tiebreaker: Florins).

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Token States
- **Repress**: Remove a Ruling Class (Knight/Rook in city) or Concession token.
  - If Empire is in play → becomes **Repressed Token** on Empire card.
  - If Empire not in play → **Killed** (discarded).
  - **Actions that Repress**:
    - Replace token via card play (pay 1 Florin).
    - Repress Op.
    - Concession replaced in Regime Change.
    - Token on Busted Emporium (via Trade Shift).
    - Tax Op if owner refuses to pay.
    - Empire Saturation (cannot place victors).
- **Un-Repress (Emancipate)**: Move Repressed Tokens to empty Cities/Borders during Regime Change.
- **Kill Repressed Tokens**:
  - Inquisitor Op – Pacification.
  - Casualties of Conspiracy or Peasant Revolt.

### Regime Change
Occurs via:
- Successful **Campaign**.
- Successful **Vote Op** (must pay Repressed Tokens in Florins; Repressed tokens must be paid on Vote Op).
- **Coronation Op**.
- **Civil War** (Conspiracy or Peasant Revolt).
- **Religious War** (Crusade, Reformation, Jihad).

**Effects**:
- Acquire Empire (if in stack) or move opponent’s Empire to your tableau (King side).
- Flip your own Empire to Republic (only way to create Republic).
- Claim 1 Concession in Empire’s Border (pay 1 Florin if occupied).
- Optionally Emancipate Repressed Tokens.

### Operations (Ops)
Activatable via E4 (once per side per turn). One Op per card.

| Op Type | Color | Effect |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Inquisitor** (Religious) | Light Blue | Move Bishop. Apply Diet of Worms (kill both if destination has Bishop) or Pacification (kill one Repressed Token). |
| **Commerce** (Economic) | Orange | Take 1 Florin from Market. |
| **Behead** (Political) | Purple | Discard opponent card with matching Location. If Empire, attacker is killed ("Assassin"). |
| **Tax** (Political) | Purple | Target Concession in acting card’s Location. Owner pays 1 Florin or Represses Concession and places a Levy. |
| **Repress** (Political) | Purple | Remove token (Knight/Rook/Pawn), store as Repressed on Empire. Gain 1 Florin. |
| **Vote** (Political) | Purple | Cause Regime Change in Empire (not Vassal, not in stack). Pay Florins = Repressed Tokens. Must have majority Concessions in Empire’s Borders. |
| **Corsair** (Military) | Dark Red | Move Pirate Rook in acting card’s Location to adjacent Sea Border. Kill any Concession or Heretic Pirate. |
| **Siege** (Military) | Dark Red | Kill one Rook, Knight, or Pirate in acting card’s Location. |
| **Campaign** (Military) | Dark Red | Attack adjacent Map Card. All Knights in acting Empire attack. Pay 1 Florin per attacker. If victorious, target becomes Vassal of acting Empire. |

### Trade Fair (E5)
Discard facedown Trade Fair card to:
1. **Create Profits**: Add 1 (2p) or 2 (3/4p) Florins to Market (from China).
2. **Trace Voyage**: Start at Emporium (Tana for East, Lisbon for West), follow Trade Route.
3. **Disperse Profits**:
   - Initiator gets 1 Florin.
   - Each Concession on Sea Border along route gets 1 Florin.
   - Each Pirate on Sea Border → 1 Florin to China.
4. **Raise Levies**: Each Map Card entered gets 1 matching token in empty City. Player chooses city. Saturated cards (all Cities full) skip.
5. **End**: At arrowhead or when profits run out. Leftover profits stay in Market.

### One-Shots (Bomb Icon)
- **Trade Shift**: Move Busted Disk to another Emporium of same color. Represses any token there.
  - *Spice Islands*: Requires 1+ Discovery Prestige. Move white disk to Trebizond (permanent).
  - *Kremlin/Sonike Wangara*: Move black disk to uncovered black Emporium.
- **Coronation**: Marry Queen to King in Empire Stack. Gain Empire (King side) and Concession.
- **Civil War**:
  - *Conspiracy*: Knights/Rooks (and Repressed Knights/Rooks) attack Ruling Class. Pirates join attackers.
  - *Peasant Revolt*: Pawns, Repressed Serfs, Concessions, Pirates attack. Repressed Knights/Rooks do not fight.
- **Religious War** (Crusade/Reformation/Jihad):
  - Attackers: Card’s non-Bishop Agents + same-color Ruling Class/Pirates in Location and adjacent Empires.
  - Defenders: Heretics (different color).
  - *Bloody Rule*: Must have at least one Heretic to trigger.
  - Success flips Map Card if opposite side matches religion.

## 6. Scoring & End Game

- A player successfully declares Victory (E6) meeting active Victory Card conditions.
- Both draw decks empty during Market Refresh → **Patron Victory** (most Patron Prestige; tiebreaker: Florins).

### Victory Conditions
- **Holy Victory**: Have more Prestige in the **supreme Religion**.
  - *Supreme Religion*: 
    - More Bishops in play than other two combined.
    - More same-color tokens in its Theocracies than other two combined (un-Repressed only).
- **Imperial Victory**: At least 2 more Kings (Empire cards on King side) than any opponent (3 more in 2p).
- **Globalization Victory**: 
  - 2 more Concessions than any opponent.
  - More Discovery Prestige than any opponent.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hand Limit**: Max 2 cards. Comets and Trade Fairs do not count.
- **Comet Purchase**: Immediately discard and activate one Victory Card.
- **Token Shortage**: Use Repressed Tokens or remove from any position.
- **Bishop Movement**: Cannot move onto Player Card. Can jump to any card with same Location or "The East"/"The West".
- **Silencing**: Bishop on card silences all Ops except Religious (Inquisitor) and silences Abilities. Prestige unaffected.
- **Strawman Plays**: You may target your own cards/tokens (e.g., vote against your King to create Republic).
- **Concession Ownership**: Concessions belong to players; Ruling Class and Pirates are neutral.
- **Market Refresh**: If one deck runs out, draw from the other (mixing East/West cards).
