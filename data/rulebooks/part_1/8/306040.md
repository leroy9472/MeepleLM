## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Merv: The Heart of the Silk Road is a strategy game set in the historic city of Merv, a key trading hub on the Silk Road. Players take on the role of influential leaders developing the city through building construction, trade, scholarship, and religious devotion. The objective is to earn the most victory points over three years through strategic use of actions, resource management, and scoring during Scoring Phases. At game end, bonus points are awarded for sets of Caravan cards. The player with the most points wins; tiebreakers are favor, influence, then player order.

3. Each player places their Master meeple in one of the numbered spaces in the upper-left outer corner—this sets initial player order.  
4. Place 4 camels on starting spaces of Mosque track (purple spaces). Place upgrade tiles and scoring tiles on designated spaces.  
5. Place year marker on leftmost space below Mosque track.  
6. Place 1 camel on each of the 4 city spaces closest to Merv in the Marketplace.  
7. Shuffle Caravan cards and deal 8 face-up next to board. Place deck nearby. Place 1 camel on the furthest card from the deck per player count.  
8. Create separate piles for common (blue) and rare (red) goods.  
9. In Library, place breakthrough scrolls into piles (2x, 4x, 6x, 8x). Place scroll tokens nearby.  
10. Place wall and gate pieces in designated areas.  
11. Each player places:  
   - 1 disc on points track at 0  
   - 1 disc on influence track (leftmost space)  
   - 1 disc on favor track (leftmost space)  
12. For 2-player: Add dummy High Courtier (third player). For solo: Use Corrupt Magistrate system with solo deck.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each year consists of:  
1. **Action Phase (4 turns)** – Players take turns in order.  
2. **Invasion Phase** – After 2nd and 3rd years.  
3. **Scoring Phase** – After each year.  

After 3rd Scoring Phase, final scoring occurs.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Turn Structure (Action Phase)  
On your turn:  
1. **Place meeple** on an unoccupied action space (side of city).  
2. **Activate a building site** in the same row or column as your meeple.  
   - If site is empty, place your building.  
   - Camel Market is not a building site.  
3. **Gain resources** from activated site and all same-color buildings in that row/column.  
   - If activating opponent’s building, they gain base resource + upgrade bonuses from their buildings in that row/column.  
4. **Perform one main action** from:  
   - Activated site’s action  
   - Gain Favor  
   - Deploy Soldier  
5. **Optional actions during turn**:  
   - Trade at Camel Market (if in active row/column):  
     - Take all camels in market, OR  
     - Place 1 camel on uncovered space to gain reward.  
   - Complete contracts (if influence requirement met):  
     - Spend resource cube shown, place contract in front of you.  
     - Pay required goods and scrolls.  
     - Score points, gain favor, or deploy soldier as indicated.  

#### Site Actions  
- **Gain Favor**: Advance 1 space on favor track. Required to score Palace courtiers.  
- **Deploy Soldier**:  
  - Place on building (no soldier, no upgrade, not wall-protected).  
  - Gain 1 influence (your building) or 2 (opponent’s).  
  - Soldier protects building for one Invasion Phase. Removed after.  
- **Caravansary**:  
  - Spend same-color or white resources (1 per card).  
  - Take caravan cards:  
    - Card at front of queue (furthest from deck)  
    - Or card immediately after one with a camel  
    - Or any card with a camel  
  - To access deeper cards, place camel on first card without one.  
  - You may only keep caravan cards of as many spice types as your influence level allows.  
  - Gain camels on taken cards.  
  - Resupply queue: slide cards forward, refill from deck.  
  - For every 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th card of same spice, gain bonus (per card).  
- **Palace**:  
  - Pay resource cost to place courtier (meeple) in a hall (1 per space).  
  - Cost: 1st courtier = 1 cube, 2nd = 2, etc. (cumulative across halls).  
  - Halls: Knowledge (scrolls), Spice (caravan cards), Trade (goods), Faith (Mosque track).  
  - First courtier in an empty hall gains 1 favor.  
- **Library**:  
  - Spend up to 4 different resources (white = wild).  
  - Gain 1 scroll per resource spent.  
  - At 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th scroll (including from contracts), choose 1 breakthrough tile from matching pile.  
  - Breakthroughs: immediate (bolt) or ongoing (infinity, usable once per turn).  
- **Marketplace**:  
  - Place disc to establish trading post:  
    - First post: must be in one of 4 central (inner) cities.  
    - Later posts: adjacent to existing post.  
  - Buy goods:  
    - 1 common good per inner city with your post.  
    - 1 rare good per outer city with your post.  
  - To connect city: place camel on route from Merv (inner) or connected city (outer).  
  - After action, move all trade route camels to Caravansary cards (start from front of queue). Excess go to Camel Market (clockwise from top-left).  
- **Mosque**:  
  - Pay resource cost to advance on track.  
  - Gain immediate bonus and points (if shown).  
  - First player on each path takes starting camel.  
  - Final space awards 4 points per Mosque-action building at game end.  
- **Wall/Gate**:  
  - Pay cost to build wall segments or gates.  
  - Gates: middle slots only. Walls: other slots.  
  - Gain 1 influence per your building protected, 2 per opponent’s.  
  - Walls protect 2 innermost sites per row/column from invasion.  
  - Middle row/column sites require only one gate for protection.  

#### Round End & Turn Order  
- After all players act:  
  - Players move master meeples to next corner.  
  - Player furthest counterclockwise places meeple in backmost available queue slot.  
  - Next clockwise player places as far back as possible.  
- **Camel use**: Spend 1 camel per slot skipped to advance in queue.  
- Gain camels on slots you skip or land on.

#### Invasion Phase (after Year 2 and 3)  
- Mongols attack 2 innermost sites from each side (top/bottom/left/right).  
- Protection:  
  - Wall/gate segment (2 needed per side, except middle row/column = 1 gate)  
  - Soldier on building  
  - Pay ransom: 1 resource of building’s type (or upgrade type if white)  
- Unprotected building: return to supply (upgrades stay).  
- Remove all soldiers and paid resources after phase.

#### Scoring Phase  
Score:  
1. **Palace**:  
   - Spend 1 favor per courtier in Palace.  
   - Score:  
     - Knowledge: 1 pt per scroll × number of courtiers  
     - Spice: 1 pt per caravan card × courtiers  
     - Trade: 1 pt per good × courtiers  
     - Faith: 1 pt per Mosque track space advanced × courtiers  
   - Goods and scrolls used in contracts still count.  
2. **Buildings**: 1 pt each.  
3. **Scoring Tiles**: 3 pts per building with matching site action symbol.  
4. **Mosque Track**: 4 pts per building with Mosque action symbol (only if reached end of track).  
- Move year marker after 1st and 2nd scoring.

#### 2-Player Game  
- Use High Courtier (dummy third player):  
  - On its turn:  
    - First player chooses action slot.  
    - Second player chooses empty building site in row/column to activate.  
    - Place High Courtier’s building.  
  - Never gains resources or performs actions.  
  - Gains camels from turn order changes; uses them to advance in queue.  
  - Buildings can be destroyed in Invasion Phase.

#### Solo Game (Corrupt Magistrate)  
- Uses solo deck and High Courtier.  
- **Turn sequence**:  
  1. Draw solo card → determines intended building type.  
  2. Choose action slot:  
     - **Method A**: Row with empty site of intended type (prioritize: most magistrate buildings → most courtier → most player → furthest from queue).  
     - **Method B**: Row with magistrate/courtier building of type (prioritize: total buildings → magistrate → player → furthest).  
  3. **Build**: Only if Method A used — place building on intended site (tiebreak: perpendicular row with more own buildings → more player → furthest from slot).  
  4. **Perform action**: Number of times = total magistrate + courtier buildings in active row.  
  5. **Camel Market**:  
     - 2+ camels: take all.  
     - <2 camels: if has camels, place 1 and gain reward (top-left, then top-right).  
- **Round End**: Magistrate and High Courtier gain camels from turn order changes; use to advance. Discard solo card.  
- **Invasion**: Magistrate’s buildings never destroyed. High Courtier’s follow normal rules.  
- **Scoring**: Magistrate scores Palace points but never spends favor.  
- **Breakthroughs**:  
  - 1st: Mosque or Caravansary (based on track vs cards) — grants +1 action.  
  - 2nd: Random — no effect, score 3 pts.  
  - 3rd: Marketplace tile → establish post, gain good, fulfill contracts.  
  - 4th: 8 pts tile → score 8; else 2 favor.  
- **Actions**:  
  - Caravansary: takes highest-scoring card (frontmost if tied). Pairs give: Ginger→soldier, Juniper→favor, Cinnamon/Pepper→3 pts.  
  - Palace: 1–3 actions → 1 courtier; 4–5 → 2 courtiers (maximize own score, then hinder player).  
  - Marketplace: prefers outer city post. Prioritizes cities: NW → NE → SW → SE. Fulfill highest-value contracts (ignores cost/influence, prefers deploying soldier).  
  - Mosque: advances 1 space per action.  
  - Library: takes 1 scroll per action. At 8+ scrolls, card removed.  
  - Wall: builds cheapest wall. Priority: protects courtier + magistrate buildings (see influence table). Color: purple > tan > teal > orange. Place clockwise if tied.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I activate my own building for opponent’s benefit?**  
  Yes. If you activate a row with an opponent’s building, they gain resources from their buildings in that row.  
- **Can I gain resources from upgrades on opponent’s buildings?**  
  No. You gain only the base resource of the activated site. Opponent gains base + upgrade bonuses from their own buildings in the row.  
- **Can I place multiple trading posts in same city?**  
  Yes. Multiple discs may occupy a city.  
- **Do I need to pay to connect a city I already have a post in?**  
  No. Only need camel if buying from a city not in your network.  
- **Can I use white resources for anything?**  
  Yes. White cubes are wild for all resource payments (actions, contracts, Mosque, etc.).  
- **Can I complete multiple contracts per turn?**  
  Yes, as long as requirements are met.  
- **Do breakthroughs stack?**  
  Yes. Each breakthrough is kept and used as described.  
- **Can I score Palace without enough favor?**  
  You must spend 1 favor per courtier. If insufficient, spend all favor and choose which courtiers score.  
- **Can walls protect from multiple sides?**  
  Yes. Each wall segment protects from one direction. A building may be protected on one side but not another.
