## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
One player takes on the role of Long John Silver, imprisoned on Treasure Island after hiding a vast treasure. The other players are pirates, each determined to be the first to find the treasure and claim victory. Long John Silver must mislead the pirates with ambiguous clues while waiting to escape and recover the treasure himself.

**Win Conditions:**  
- **Pirates:** The first pirate to locate the treasure during a search action wins.  
- **Long John Silver:** Wins by escaping and moving his miniature to the treasure’s location before any pirate finds it.

### 3. Setup

   - Place Calendar board adjacent to south edge, matching player count.

2. **Deck Preparation:**  
   - Shuffle and place near board: Starting Hints, Black Spot Hints, Compass Hints.  
   - Place tools within reach.

3. **Long John Silver (LJS) Setup:**

   - Draws: 3 Starting Hints, (Pirates + 3) Compass Hints.  
   - *Expansion:* Draws 3 value-1 and 2 value-2 Trick Cards.

4. **Pirate Setup:**  
   - Each pirate takes: 1 (or more) miniature(s), matching screen, marker, character sheet, turn order token, mini-map, memo sheet.  
   - In 2-player: pirate controls 3 miniatures; in 3-player: each pirate controls 2.

5. **Turn Order:**  
   - Starting with player to the right of LJS, pirates place turn order tokens on the leftmost free Skull spaces before June 1st, in counterclockwise order.

6. **Pirate Starting Locations:**  
   - Each pirate places their miniature on designated starting spot (marked by cross-in-circle).  
   - Draw a circle on the dotted line around the starting location.

7. **Treasure Placement (LJS only):**  
   - LJS secretly marks treasure location on his mini-map with a black cross.  
   - Invalid locations:  
     - Within 2-mile radius of any pirate starting location  
     - Inside restricted areas (red-lined zones)  
     - On any dotted line border  
   - *Note:* Treasure may lie on the border between valid zones.

8. **District Hints Distribution:**  
   - LJS removes the District Hint matching the treasure’s district and keeps it hidden.  
   - Shuffles remaining 10 (or 11) District Hints, deals one to each pirate in clockwise order (starting left of LJS).  
   - Pirates keep their hint secret.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn follows this sequence:

#### 1. Calendar Update (LJS)
- Move the leftmost turn order token to the next available day on the Calendar.

#### 2. Calendar Event (LJS)
If the new space has an event, resolve it immediately:

- **Starting Hint:** LJS plays one Starting Hint from hand (see *Starting Hints & Black Spot Hints*).  
- **Black Spot Hint:** LJS plays one Black Spot Hint from hand.  
- **The Black Spot:** LJS discards current Starting Hints and draws 3 Black Spot Hints.  
- **Prison:** The active pirate chooses one of the 8 (or 9) towers; LJS places his miniature there.  
- **Information “Bluff” Token:** LJS takes one “Bluff” token and places it behind his screen.  
- **Escape:** LJS escapes (see *End Game*).

#### 3. Pirate Actions
The pirate whose token was moved performs 1 or 2 actions (based on stars on the Calendar space):

##### Normal Actions:
- **Horse Move (6 miles):** Use ruler to draw straight line from current position (max 6 miles). Cannot pass through or stop in restricted areas. Mark new location with a cross.
- **Foot Move & Small Search:** Combine one Foot Move (3 miles, same rules) and one Small Search, in any order.
- **Large Search:** Use large search template. Miniature’s position must be inside the template. Draw a circle. Ask LJS if treasure is inside.

##### Special Actions:
- **Verification:** Look at one face-down Information token on the Calendar. Cannot show it, but may lie about its content.
- **Full Gallop:** Move miniature to any legal location (not restricted areas). Do not draw movement line.
- **Compass:** Place large compass around miniature (aligned to North). LJS gives one Compass Hint (truthful). Player may record on mini-map with small compass.
- **Special Abilities (by character):**
  - **Anne Bonny – King George:** Perform a Small Search anywhere on the board (ignoring own position).
  - **Anne Bonny – Compass:** May use Compass action twice per game.
  - **Olivier Levasseur – Spyglass:** Perform a Large Search anywhere on the board.
  - **Olivier Levasseur – Thoroughbred:** When using Horse Move, may move 12 miles total (two 6-mile segments).
  - **Jim Hawkins – Fortune:** When performing Large Search, use outer edge of template (larger area).
  - **Charlotte de Berry – Ancient Scrolls:** Draw 2 additional District Hints (LJS verifies they are not the treasure’s district).

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Search Actions
- After Small or Large Search, LJS must answer:
  1. **Treasure Found:** If circle contains or touches treasure → LJS gives chest with treasure → pirate wins.
  2. **Unsuccessful, No Reward:** LJS says “nothing found.”
  3. **Unsuccessful, With Chest Token:** LJS secretly places a Chest token in the chest and gives it to the pirate.

- **Chest Tokens (single use):**
  - **Item Tokens:** Grant extra action:
    - 7-mile move
    - Any additional action
    - Extra Small Search
  - **Information Tokens:** Reveal secret clue:
    - Treasure is west of searcher’s position
    - Treasure is east of searcher’s position
    - Treasure is not in current district

#### Hints from LJS
- **Starting Hints & Black Spot Hints:**
  - Played on Calendar, accompanied by a face-down “Truth” or “Bluff” token.
  - First hint is always “Truth.”
  - LJS draws info, marks board (if needed), then draws replacement hint.
  - Hints with **Chest icon** require LJS to have previously given a Chest token.
  - If LJS holds 3 Chest-icon hints, may discard and redraw 3.

- **Compass Hints:**
  - Given when pirate uses Compass action.
  - Shows two directions where treasure is *not* located (skull zones).
  - Must be truthful.

- **District Hints:**
  - Given at start; each eliminates one district.
  - Kept secret; cannot be shared.

#### Trick Cards (*Expansion*)
- LJS has Trick Points (0 = hard, 1 = default, 2 = easy, 3 = very easy).
- Can play at any time, but total Trick Points used ≤ difficulty setting.
- Must respect calendar date on card (can only play on or before that date).
- Examples:
  - **Traitor:** Secretly give Traitor token with Chest token; traitor wins if LJS wins.
  - **Phantom:** Control multiple LJS miniatures post-escape.
  - **Lie:** Force a false hint; must associate with “Lie” token.

#### Long John Silver’s Escape
- Triggered when a turn order token lands on **Escape** space.
- **Changes:**
  - Calendar no longer used.
  - Play proceeds clockwise, starting with LJS.
  - LJS gets **2 Horse Moves per turn** (4 miles each → 8 miles total).
  - Pirates retain 2 actions per turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends immediately when:
- **A pirate finds the treasure** via a search action → that pirate wins.
- **LJS moves his miniature onto the treasure location** after escape → LJS wins.

No scoring; first to achieve win condition wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can players share information?**  
  No showing of District Hints, Compass Hints, or Information tokens. Discussion and lying are allowed.

- **Can I use an ∞-symbol action twice in one turn?**  
  Yes, but each use counts as one action.

- **Can King George or Spyglass lead to a win?**  
  Yes. If the remote search reveals the treasure, the pirate wins immediately.

- **Can LJS lie when playing a “Bluff” token, even if the clue says “if impossible, say so”?**  
  Yes. “Bluff” allows lying even in edge cases.

- **If a search template crosses a restricted area, is the other side considered?**  
  No. Only the area containing the searcher’s position is considered.

- **Treasure on a border?**  
  Yes. A hint like “north of X” includes the line through X’s position.

- **Measurements: board vs. mini-map?**  
  Board measurements always prevail. Mini-maps are for notes only.
