## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the role of tribal chiefs cultivating cacao and trading resources to bring prosperity to their tribe. The goal is to earn the most gold by the end of the game through efficient worker placement, resource management, and strategic expansion in the jungle. The player with the most gold wins; ties are broken first by leftover cacao fruit, then by shared victory.

3. Setup  
a. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
- 1 Player Board  
- 1 Water Carrier (placed on -10 of water track)  
- 11 Worker Tiles in their color  

b. Adjust Worker Tiles based on player count:  
- 2P: Keep all 11 tiles  
- 3P: Return one 1-1-1-1 tile to box  
- 4P: Return one 1-1-1-1 and one 2-1-0-1 tile to box  

c. Shuffle remaining Worker Tiles into a face-down deck. Draw 3 tiles to form starting hand (kept secret).  

d. Prepare Jungle Tiles:  
- Use full set for 3–4 players  
- For 2 players: Remove 2x Single Plantation, 1x '3' Market, 1x Value 1 Mine, 1x Water, 1x Sun Worshipping Site, 1x Temple  

e. Place starting tiles: 1 Single Plantation and 1 '2' Market diagonally adjacent (corner to corner).  

f. Shuffle remaining Jungle Tiles into a draw pile. Reveal top 2 as display.  

g. Form supply piles: Gold (48), Cacao (20), Sun Tokens (12).  

h. Oldest player becomes starting player.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds clockwise. On a turn, a player performs the following steps in order:

1. Place 1 Worker Tile  
- Choose 1 tile from hand and place it face-up orthogonally adjacent to at least one Jungle Tile.  
- Orientation may be freely chosen.  
- No Worker Tile may share an edge with another Worker Tile.  
- Jungle Tiles may never share an edge with another Jungle Tile.  
- Resulting layout forms a checkerboard pattern.

2. Fill Jungle Spaces  
- If placement creates an empty space bordered by 2 or more Worker Tiles, fill it immediately with a Jungle Tile from the display.  
- Active player chooses which tile to place.  
- If multiple spaces are created:  
  - Fill first two from display  
  - Then replenish display from draw pile (if possible)  
  - Continue filling until all such spaces are resolved  
- If display has fewer than 2 tiles after selections, do not refill until end of turn.

3. Perform Jungle Tile Actions  
- Activate each worker on the newly placed Worker Tile that is adjacent to a Jungle Tile.  
- Additionally, any player (including non-active) may activate workers adjacent to any newly placed Jungle Tile this turn.  
- Each worker activates exactly once in the game: either when its tile is placed or when a Jungle Tile is placed next to it.  
- Activation is optional.  
- Order of activation per tile: resolve all workers on one edge before moving to another edge. Players may choose edge order.  
- Available Actions (per worker):  
  - Plantation: Take 1 cacao (up to storage limit of 5)  
  - Market (2/3/4): Sell 1 cacao for 2/3/4 gold  
  - Gold Mine (1/2): Gain 1 or 2 gold  
  - Water: Move your water carrier +1 clockwise on track  
  - Sun Worshipping Site: Gain 1 sun token (max 3 stored)  
  - Temple: No immediate effect  

4. End of Turn  
- Draw 1 Worker Tile from your deck (if available)  
- Replenish Jungle Display to 2 tiles (if draw pile is not empty)  
- Next player takes turn

Overbuilding Rule (Late Game)  
When the Jungle draw pile is empty and no Jungle tiles remain in the display:  
- On your turn, you may choose to overbuild instead of placing normally  
- Requirements:  
  - Spend 1 sun token (must have at least one)  
  - Place a new Worker Tile on top of one of your previously placed Worker Tiles  
- Effects:  
  - Activate workers on the new tile as normal (if adjacent to Jungle Tiles)  
  - The overbuilt tile remains in play but is covered  
  - Each Worker Tile may be overbuilt only once

5. Core Mechanics  
- Checkerboard Growth: Worker and Jungle Tiles alternate in placement; no same-type tiles may be orthogonally adjacent.  
- Dual Activation: Workers trigger when:  
  a) Their tile is placed next to a Jungle Tile  
  b) A Jungle Tile is placed next to them later  
- Simultaneous Play: Multiple players may activate workers during a single turn (when new Jungle Tiles are placed).  
- Resource Limits:  
  - Cacao storage: max 5  
  - Sun tokens: max 3  
  - Water carrier: moves only clockwise on track (-10 to +16)  
- Gold Management: Players may make change with the bank at any time.

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after the round in which all players have placed their final Worker Tile.

Final Scoring Steps:

1. Score Temples (one at a time):  
- Count orthogonally adjacent worker icons for each temple  
- Highest: +6 gold  
- Second highest: +3 gold  
- Tie for first: split 6 gold evenly (round down); no second-place bonus  
- Tie for second: split 3 gold evenly (round down)  
- Players with zero adjacent workers score nothing  
- Flip scored temple to back after resolution  

2. Sun Tokens: +1 gold per unused sun token  

3. Water Carrier: Add/subtract gold based on final position on water track (value shown at position)  

4. Final Gold Total:  
- Sum all gold  
- Leftover cacao has no value  

Winning:  
- Most gold wins  
- Tiebreaker 1: Most leftover cacao  
- Tiebreaker 2: Shared victory

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I place a Worker Tile that doesn’t touch any Jungle Tile?  
  A: No. All Worker Tile placements must be orthogonally adjacent to at least one Jungle Tile.  

- Q: Can I decline to fill a Jungle Space if two workers border it?  
  A: No. Filling is mandatory if tiles are available.  

- Q: Can I overbuild without spending a sun token?  
  A: No. Spending 1 sun token is required. If you have none, you cannot overbuild.  

- Q: Can a worker activate twice?  
  A: No. Each worker activates exactly once—either when its tile is placed or when a Jungle Tile is placed next to it.  

- Q: What happens if the Jungle draw pile is empty and only one tile is in display?  
  A: You may still fill one Jungle Space. If a second is created, you cannot fill it (insufficient tiles).  

- Q: Can I place a Worker Tile that creates more than two Jungle Spaces?  
  A: Yes. Fill two from display, refill display (if possible), then continue filling.  

- Q: Do I draw a worker tile if my deck is empty?  
  A: No. Skip the draw step if your deck is empty.
