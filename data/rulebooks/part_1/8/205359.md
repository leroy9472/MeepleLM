## Operations – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Operations is a co-operative format for *Star Wars Destiny*, where players team up to defeat AI-controlled enemies across multiple cinematic stages set in iconic Star Wars scenes. The objective is to advance through all stages of a scenario by defeating the AI’s characters in each stage. When players successfully complete the final stage, they win the game.

Each scenario uses an "Objective Set" containing Stages (specialized battlefields). Side A of each Stage lists the card sets used to build the AI deck for that stage, and Side B contains gameplay details.

### 2. Components  
- *Star Wars Destiny* cards (official, fan, or ARH sets)  
- Character cards and dice specified per Stage  
- Objective Sets (containing Stages)  
- Basic Behavior set (used in every AI deck)  
- Dice (player and AI)  
- Shields, resources, and standard game tokens  

Note: Stages function as battlefields but are not rolled for; they are placed into play per scenario rules.

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose a scenario (Objective Set).  
2. Examine Stage 1A to determine which card sets compose the AI deck.  
3. Put into play all characters listed on Stage 1A; set aside unused characters.  
4. Each player builds a legal deck following standard *Star Wars Destiny* rules with additional team-based restrictions (see Deck-building Rules).  
5. Gather the Basic Behavior set.  
6. Combine all cards from the sets listed on Stage 1A (including Basic Behavior) into one deck—the AI deck. Do not include battlefields.  
7. Reveal Side B of Stage 1.  
8. Each player performs standard game setup (draw starting hand, etc.), **without** rolling for battlefield.  
9. Players collectively choose the first player and give them the "First Player, Operations" battlefield.  
10. The AI starts with **2 resources**.  
11. Each player gains **shields equal to 3 minus the number of players** (e.g., 2 shields for 1 player, 1 shield for 2 players, 0 for 3+).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds. Each round consists of:

#### Upkeep Phase  
- Players perform normal upkeep.  
- AI performs upkeep:  
  - Gains **1 resource per player**.  
  - Returns all dice and readies all cards.  
  - Shuffles its discard pile into its deck.  

#### Action Phase  
- Players take turns in clockwise order, each taking **1 action**.  
- After all players have taken a turn, the **AI takes its turn**:  
  1. Draw the top card of the AI deck.  
  2. Check the top-left symbol on the card:  
     - If it's a **resource symbol**, treat it as the card’s resource cost.  
     - If it's an **effect symbol**, resolve it **against each player**, starting with the first player. Effects are harmful unless they benefit the AI (e.g., shields).  
  3. Resolve the **card’s effect**.  
  4. The AI **cannot** resolve player dice or activate player characters.  
  5. If the AI deck is empty:  
     - Resolve as many dice as possible showing the same side.  
     - If unable, the AI passes.  
  6. The AI has **no hand**; its hand is the **top 5 cards** of its deck.  
  7. Dice are resolved against **one target**, unless stated otherwise (e.g., "each player").  
  8. Effects with **per-player multipliers** apply once per player.

After the AI’s turn, the round ends. A new round begins with the Upkeep Phase.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Player Interaction  
- Players **do not** use individual battlefields.  
- All players must share the **same affiliation** (or be neutral/both, e.g., Reylo).  
- **Unique card rules apply to the entire team**—only one copy of a unique card may be in play across all players.  
- Players **can** play upgrades on teammates’ characters.  
- Redeploy effects can move upgrades between player characters.  
- Players **cannot**:  
  - Spot cards on a teammate’s area.  
  - Assign indirect damage to teammate’s characters.  
  - Play supports into a teammate’s play area.  
  - Share resources.  
  - Use "you" or "your" effects to refer to teammates.  

#### AI Targeting & Priorities  
- **AI Target Priority** (for effects/dice against players):  
  1. Least health remaining  
  2. Most dice in pool  
  3. Highest damage sides (including upgrades)  
  4. Uniqueness (target unique cards first)  
  5. Highest resource cost  
  6. Lowest set number  

- **AI Upgrade Priority** (when playing an upgrade):  
  1. Ready character  
  2. Most health (including shields)  
  3. Fewest upgrades attached  
  4. Most base damage sides  
  5. Uniqueness  
  6. Lowest set number  
  7. Leftmost character in play  

- **AI Self Priority** (for self-targeting effects):  
  - **Shields**: Least health → most dice  
  - **Focus**: Highest damage sides  
  - **Special**: Most damage output  
  - **Indirect**: Distribute evenly; remove shields first, then non-unique characters  
  - **Activation**: Least dice → most upgrades → highest damage → most health (including shields)  

#### AI Preferences & Behavior  
- The AI **overrides** an existing upgrade if a new one is **cheaper** or has **less base damage** on its die.  
- The AI **maximizes damage output** on players and **minimizes damage taken**.  
- The AI **keeps information hidden** unless forced to reveal.  
- The AI **always uses Guardian** and gains resources for dice in its pool that have a cost.  
- The AI **focuses only to usable sides** and turns modifiers if they can't be used.  
- The AI resolves dice for **maximum effect**, even for non-damage effects (e.g., disrupt, discard).  
- Before drawing, the AI **attempts to use actions on player cards** that opponents can use (e.g., Jar Jar Binks).  
- If the AI would gain the battlefield, give it to a teammate instead.  

#### Advancing Stages  
- After the **end of the Action Phase**, if the AI has **no characters in play**, the stage advances.  
- To advance:  
  - Build a new AI deck using the sets listed on **Side A of the next Stage** (always include Basic Behavior).  
  - The AI **loses all resources, cards, downgrades, and effects** from the previous stage.  
  - Shields and focus may carry over and be resolved on teammates.  
- **Per-player values** (e.g., damage multipliers) only change when a stage advances.  

#### Multi-Stages  
- Marked with **M-X** in the set box.  
- Multiple stages are **in play simultaneously**, each with its own play area and AI deck.  
- Effects **do not cross** between play areas.  
- Resolve AI actions in **order: M-1, M-2, M-3**, etc.  
- If a multi-stage has **no players**, it continues to act normally—AI still draws, resolves effects (with no valid targets if needed), and performs upkeep.  

#### Player Elimination  
- A player is **eliminated** if:  
  - They have **no characters in play**, or  
  - They have **no cards in hand or deck**.  
- Eliminated players **do not act** but remain part of team-wide rules (e.g., unique limits).  
- The game continues as long as **at least one player remains**.  
- Players with no cards are **not eliminated until the end of Upkeep**, per standard rules.  

#### Deck-Building Rules  
- Players follow standard *Star Wars Destiny* deck construction.  
- Additional rules:  
  - All players must have **same affiliation** (or neutral/both).  
  - Unique card restriction applies **team-wide**.  

#### Battlefield Rules  
- If a battlefield would switch, **flip the First Player battlefield** instead.  
- If an effect would give battlefield control to an opponent, **choose a teammate** instead.  

#### Expert Mode & Keywords  
- **Expert Mode**: Add the Expert Mode set to every stage and put its plot into play.  
- **Hunter keyword**: Cards with this keyword **remain in play** when stages advance.  
- **Detect**: Flip a card in the AI’s hand faceup, then return it to its original position in the deck.  

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is **no traditional scoring**.  
- The game ends when:  
  - **Players win**: Successfully advance past the **final stage** of the scenario.  
  - **Players lose**: **All players are eliminated** before completing the final stage.  

---

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **AI with no deck**: Resolve dice showing the same side; if not possible, pass.  
- **AI hand**: Top 5 cards of the deck. Cards may be faceup due to "Detect".  
- **"Player" on AI card**: The AI **does not count** as a player.  
- **Targeting**: A player effect targeting "an opponent" or "another player" **can target a teammate or the AI**.  
- **AI activation**: Ready cards the AI could activate when passing **do not activate** in that round.  
- **Multi-stage with no players**: AI continues to act and upkeep; effects without valid targets are skipped.  
- **Joining a stage**: Per-player values **do not change** when a player joins mid-stage.  
- **Character vs. Objective sets**: Character sets contain ≥1 character; Objective sets contain Stages.
