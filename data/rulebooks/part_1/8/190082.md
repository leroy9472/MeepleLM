## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Whitehall Mystery*, set in Victorian London, Jack the Ripper has committed a murder and aims to dispose of body parts at three additional secret locations—Discovery Locations—without being caught. Jack wins by reaching all four Discovery Locations (one per quadrant of the city) across up to three rounds. The Investigators, representing law enforcement, win by arresting Jack—correctly guessing his current location.

Jack moves in secret along numbered circles (streets), while the three Investigators move on crossings (black squares) and attempt to deduce Jack’s path by searching for clues or making arrests.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Assign Roles:** One player becomes Jack; others control the Investigators. A single player may control multiple Investigators if fewer than 4 players.  
2. **Give Jack Components:** Provide Jack with the screen, move track sheet, pen, 15 yellow markers, 4 red markers, 6 blue special movement tiles, and the Jack figure.  
3. **Place Jack Figure:** Put Jack at position 0 on the move track.  
4. **Choose Discovery Locations:**  
   - Jack secretly selects one white circle in each of the four quadrants.  
   - Records these four numbers at the top of the move track sheet.  
5. **Set Starting Location:**  
   - Jack chooses one of the four Discovery Locations as the starting point.  
   - Places a red discovery location marker on that circle.  
   - Writes that number in the Round 1 grey box (position 0) on the move track.  
6. **Place Investigators:**  
   - Each Investigator starts on a different yellow-bordered crossing.  
7. **Give Investigators Their Tiles:**  
   - Distribute the three colored Investigator figures.  
   - Optionally give them the 4 black tiles and Smoker tile if using optional rules.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of up to **3 rounds**. Each round ends when Jack reaches a Discovery Location or exhausts 15 moves. Each **turn** has three phases:

#### Phase 1: Jack Movement  
- Jack moves from his current numbered circle to an **adjacent circle** along a dotted line.  
- He records the new circle number on his move track sheet.  
- Advances the Jack figure **one space** on the move track (or two if using Coach).  
- **Jack must move every turn.** He cannot stay in place.  
- Jack **cannot pass through a crossing occupied by an Investigator**.  
- If Jack cannot move legally, he **loses the game**.  

**Special Movement (Optional):**  
Instead of a normal move, Jack may use one of his 6 blue special movement tiles (once per tile):  

- **Coach (2 tiles):** Move twice through two adjacent circles. May pass through crossings with Investigators. Cannot end where started. Record both locations. Move Jack figure **two spaces** on track.  
- **Alley (2 tiles):** Move from one circle to another on the perimeter of the **same block of houses** (area bounded by dotted lines, no blue circles).  
- **Boat (2 tiles):** Move from one **blue circle** to another **blue circle** within the **same block of water** (area bounded by black/blue lines, contains blue circles).  

> ❗ Jack **cannot use a special movement tile to enter a Discovery Location**.  
> ❗ Each tile is used only once and is discarded after use (unless optional rules apply).

#### Phase 2: Investigator Movement  
- Investigators move in fixed order: **Yellow → Blue → Red**.  
- Each may move **0, 1, or 2 crossings** along dotted lines.  
- Investigators **may move through other Investigators** but **cannot end on the same crossing**.  
- Movement ignores locations (numbered circles).  

#### Phase 3: Investigator Actions  
After all movement, each Investigator takes an action in order: **Yellow → Blue → Red**.  

Each may choose **one** of the following:  

**A. Look for Clues**  
- Announce a **numbered circle directly connected** to the crossing (no intervening crossing or circle).  
- Jack truthfully answers **“Yes”** if that location appears on his move track **this round**.  
  - If **Yes**: Jack places a **yellow clue marker** on that circle. The Investigator’s action ends.  
  - If **No**: The Investigator may name another adjacent circle.  
- The Investigator may keep trying until a clue is found or all adjacent locations are checked.  

**B. Execute an Arrest**  
- Announce a **numbered circle directly connected** to the crossing.  
- Jack answers **“Yes”** or **“No”** if he is currently at that location.  
  - If **Yes**: Game ends. **Investigators win**.  
  - If **No**: The Investigator’s action ends. No further information is revealed.  

> ⚠️ Only one action (Clue or Arrest) per Investigator per turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Discovery Location Completion  
- At the end of Phase 3, if Jack is at a Discovery Location:  
  - He places a **red marker** on that circle.  
  - If this is the **fourth** Discovery Location marked, **Jack wins**.  
  - Otherwise, the round ends and a new round begins.  

#### End of Round  
When a round ends (Jack reaches a Discovery Location or reaches move 15):  
1. Reset Jack figure to **0** on move track.  
2. **Remove all yellow clue markers** from the board.  
3. **Discard any used blue special movement tiles** (unless optional rule applies).  
4. Jack writes the number of the **current Discovery Location** in the **Round 2 or 3 start box** on the move track.  
5. New round begins with Jack’s Movement Phase.  

> ❗ If Jack **fails to reach a Discovery Location within 15 moves**, he **loses**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
There is no scoring system. The game ends immediately when:  
- **Jack wins**: Places the **fourth red discovery marker** (reaches all 4 Discovery Locations).  
- **Investigators win**: Correctly **arrest Jack** (call his current location during an arrest attempt).  
- **Jack loses**:  
  - Cannot move legally (surrounded by Investigators).  
  - Fails to reach a Discovery Location within 15 moves in a round.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can Jack use multiple special movements in one turn?**  
  No. Only one special movement per turn, and each tile can be used only once per game.  

- **Can Investigators look for clues at a location with a red marker?**  
  Yes. A red marker only indicates a Discovery Location. Jack may have visited it earlier in the round.  

- **Can Jack move into a circle already marked with a yellow clue?**  
  Yes. Yellow clues only show Jack passed through that location this round.  

- **Do Investigators know which special movement Jack used?**  
  By default, **yes**—tiles are placed face-up. Optional rule “Murderer at Large” allows face-down placement.  

- **Can the Yellow Investigator use Smoker and their own ability in the same game?**  
  Yes. The Smoker tile and Jasper Waring’s ability are separate one-time effects.  

- **Can Investigators coordinate?**  
  Yes. They may discuss strategy and share information freely.  

- **What if Jack uses Coach and passes through a location adjacent to an Investigator?**  
  The Investigator cannot react during Jack’s movement. Only after full movement can they act.  

- **Can Jack use Boat or Alley to exit a water/house block and enter a Discovery Location?**  
  No. Jack **cannot use special movement tiles to enter a Discovery Location**.
