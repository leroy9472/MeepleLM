# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In Trains, players act as railroad tycoons competing to build the most efficient and valuable rail network across Japan (or other map regions). The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VPs) by constructing rail lines, building stations in cities, claiming remote locations, and acquiring VP-generating cards.

## 2. Components
- 1 double-sided game board (Tokyo/Osaka) or alternate map boards
- 80 rail tokens (20 per player in 4-player game, in 4 colors)
- 4 scoring markers (1 per player)
- 30 white station tokens
- 31 randomizer cards
- 40 card dividers
- 500 cards across multiple types:
  - Core Cards (used every game): Express Train, Limited Express Train, Lay Rails, Station Expansion, Apartment, Tower, Skyscraper, Waste
  - Randomized Cards (8 drawn per game): e.g., Landfill, Steel Bridge, Amusement Park, etc.
- 70 Waste cards

## 3. Setup
1. Choose board side (Tokyo or Osaka) or alternate map; place station tokens beside board.
2. Each player selects a color, takes all 20 rail tokens and 1 scoring marker.
3. Place scoring marker on 0 of VP track.
4. Each player takes:
   - 7 Normal Train
   - 2 Lay Rails
   - 1 Station Expansion
5. Shuffle these 10 cards to form personal deck.
6. Create common supply stacks:
   - Express Train (20)
   - Limited Express Train (10)
   - Lay Rails (20 minus starting decks)
   - Station Expansion (20 minus starting decks)
   - Apartment (10)
   - Tower (10)
   - Skyscraper (10)
   - Waste (70)
   - 8 additional card types drawn randomly from randomizer deck
7. Return unused Normal Train cards and tokens to box.
8. Starting player is the one who most recently traveled by train.
9. In clockwise order, each player places one rail token as starting position:
   - Not on sea space
   - Not on remote location (star)
   - Not on space occupied by another player
   - No cost or Waste taken for this initial placement

## 4. Gameplay Flow
On a player’s turn, choose one of two actions:

### A. Normal Turn
1. **Play Cards** (any order, multiple times):
   - Play card from hand → gain its Value (money)
   - Optionally apply its effect (must apply fully if chosen)
   - Resolve each card completely before next
2. **Buy Cards** (any order, multiple times):
   - Spend accumulated money
   - Buy any available card (except Waste)
   - Multiple copies allowed
   - Bought cards go to "gained cards" area
3. **Clean Up**:
   - Move all cards in play, gained, and hand to discard pile
   - Draw 5 new cards (reshuffle discard if needed)
   - Check end-game conditions

### B. Pass Turn
1. Return all Waste cards from hand to Waste supply
2. Perform Clean Up (same as above)

Money resets to 0 at end of turn. Cards with effects lasting "until end of turn" expire.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Card Types
- **Train (Blue)**: Generate money when played
- **Rail Laying (Green)**: Option to place rail token
- **Station Expansion (Purple)**: Build station in any city
- **Action (Red)**: Perform special effect
- **Victory Point (Gold)**: Score VPs at game end
- **Waste (Black)**: Useless card; clogs deck

### Lay Rails Costs
Place token adjacent to existing token (diagonals separated by ▢ are not adjacent). Costs:
- Field: 0
- River: 1
- Mountain: 2
- City: 1 + number of station markers
- Remote Location: Number in star
- Other player’s token in space: +1 cost + gain 1 Waste
- Multiple conditions: sum all applicable costs

**Note**: Gaining Waste is not part of cost; it’s a separate result.

### Station Expansion
- Place station in any city
- Max stations per city shown on board
- No adjacency requirement
- Always gain 1 Waste when playing card

### Buying Cards
- Must have sufficient money
- Bought cards go to "gained cards" area
- At Clean Up, all cards (played, gained, hand) go to discard
- Cannot buy Waste

### Waste Management
- Gained when:
  - Laying rails where another player has token
  - Building station
  - Buying VP card
- Can be removed by passing turn (return all to supply)
- Cannot be trashed; if trashed, return to supply
- Game does not end if Waste supply is exhausted

### Card Effects
- **Draw**: Take cards from deck to hand
- **Trash**: Remove card from game
- **Reaction**: Play during other players’ turns to block attacks
- Effects must be applied fully and in order if chosen

## 6. Scoring & End Game

### End Game Conditions
Game ends at end of any player’s turn if:
- Any 4 card stacks (excluding Waste) are depleted
- Any player has used all 20 rail tokens
- All 30 station tokens have been placed

### Final Scoring
Each player scores:
1. **City Bonus Points** per rail token:
   - 0 stations: 0 pts
   - 1 station: 2 pts
   - 2 stations: 4 pts
   - 3 stations: 8 pts
2. **Remote Location Points** per rail token:
   - Value shown in star
3. **Card Points**:
   - Sum VP values on all gold VP cards in hand, deck, and discard

**Total = City + Remote + Card Points**

### Tiebreaker
1. Most rail tokens on board
2. If still tied, share victory

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Initial placement**: No cost, no Waste
- **Money**: Accumulates during turn, lost at end
- **Multiple players in space**: Only 1 Waste gained regardless of number of opponents
- **Waste supply empty**: Continue game; skip gaining Waste if required
- **Waste card in deck**: Does not score VP
- **Tourist Train**: Can score 1 VP during game
- **Amusement Park**: Gain coins equal to base value (not modified) of one Train card
- **Ironworks**: Grants +2 coins per Rail Laying card played, even if no track built
- **Subway Excavation**: Negates all extra costs including remote locations (AEG version)
- **Viaduct**: Negates city/station costs, but not opponent token costs
- **Collaboration**: Removes cost and Waste penalty for opponent tokens
- **Discard pile**: Cannot normally look through; reshuffled only when drawing and deck empty
