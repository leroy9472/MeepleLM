## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
**Lore**:  
*Struggle of Empires* is set in the 18th century, a period of exploration, colonization, industrialization, and near-constant warfare among European powers. Players lead one of seven major European nations, competing for dominance through military conquest, economic development, and strategic alliances across Europe and its colonies.

**Objective**:  
Players score Victory Points (VPs) by gaining control of 11 key regions (7 in Europe, 6 colonial) over three Wars. The player with the most VPs at the end of the third War wins. Excessive Unrest can lead to revolution (0 VPs) or significant penalties.

### 3. Setup
1. **Neutral Control Markers**: Place all 65 in a bag. Randomly draw and place 10 face-up on their corresponding regions.
2. **Player Assignment**: Each player selects a major power (e.g., Britain, France) and takes matching components.
3. **Starting Control**: Each player draws 5 random neutral control markers and places one of their control markers on each indicated region. Discard the neutral markers.
4. **Starting Units**: Beginning with the start player and proceeding clockwise, each player places one military unit (army, navy, or fort) in any Victory Point region. Repeat for 5 rounds.
5. **Player Resources**: Each player starts with:
   - 5 Population
   - $10
   - 5 control tokens (already placed)
6. **Board Setup**: Place game-state markers on War I and Round 1. The first player starts the first alliance auction.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game consists of **3 Wars**. Each War has 6 phases:

1. **Battlegrounds** (Skip in War I):  
   Draw and place 10 new neutral control markers on the map.

2. **Diplomacy (Grand Alliances)**:  
   Players form two opposing alliances via a series of auctions:
   - Auctions begin with the player who took the last turn in the previous War (start player in War I).
   - Each auction proposes two unallied powers: one for the "Top" alliance, one for the "Bottom."
   - Players bid in gold (including $0). Highest bidder wins, pays the bank, and assigns the proposed powers.
   - Auctions continue until all players are in an alliance.
   - Turn order is determined by alliance placement (leftmost = first).

3. **Player Actions** (5 or 6 Rounds):  
   Players take turns in alliance order. Each round:
   - Players perform **2 actions** (Regular or 1 Regular + 1 Special).
   - Players may also use any number of **Free Actions** (e.g., Taxation, tile abilities).
   - After all players act, advance the Round marker. Repeat for 6 rounds (2–4 players) or 5 rounds (5–7 players).

   **Action Options**:
   - **Build 1 Unit**: Spend 1 Population to build an army, navy, or fort in your home country, then move it (free move, subject to movement rules).
   - **Move 2 Units**: Move any two units independently. Distant sea moves (crossing "ropes") require a die roll.
   - **Perform 1 Attack**: Pay $2 to attack a region. Includes Naval Combat (for +1 land combat bonus) and Land Combat (to capture control).
   - **Colonize**: Replace a neutral "Pop" marker with your control marker. Cost: 1 Population.
   - **Gold Coast Commerce**: Replace a neutral "Slave" marker with your control marker. Requires a navy in Africa. No Population cost.
   - **Establish Local Alliance**: Pay $1 (for some) to place a local alliance marker in a region. Grants +1 strength in combat there. Removed at end of War.
   - **Claim 1 Tile**: Acquire a tile (development, trade, tactic, etc.) by paying its cost (gold, population, unrest).
   - **Pass**: Take no action. If you pass both actions or pass one and didn’t attack, you may return 1 Unrest point.

4. **Income and Maintenance & Population Increase**:
   - **Income**: Gain $1 per Population + $1 per control marker.
   - **Maintenance**: Pay $1 per military unit (army, navy, fort).
   - **Taxation**: If short on funds, gain $2 (or $3 with Banking tile) and 1 Unrest per deficit.
   - **Population**: Increase Population by 5, up to a maximum of 9.

5. **Assess Control for Victory Points**:
   - For each of the 11 regions, award VPs based on control marker count:
     - Highest count: 1st VP value
     - Second highest: 2nd VP value
     - Third highest (if applicable): 3rd VP value
   - Ties: All tied players score the full value.
   - Neutral markers are ignored.

6. **End of War**:
   - Return Local Alliance markers.
   - Reset "once per war" tiles.
   - Advance War marker.
   - The player who took the last turn starts the next War’s first auction.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Control**: Zero-sum game. Replace foreign or neutral control markers with your own to gain influence.
- **Population**: Ranges 0–9. Used to build units (cost 1) and determines income. Increases by 5 after maintenance.
- **Unrest**: Hidden counters. Gained from:
  - Losing any military unit (1)
  - Taxation (1 per instance)
  - Claiming Industry tile (2)
  - Destroying a unit to rebuild elsewhere (1)
  - At end of game: 7 VP penalty for highest unrest, 4 VP for second highest (if <20).
  - ≥20 Unrest: Revolution (0 VPs).
- **Gold & Taxation**: Always available via taxation. Gain $2 (or $3 with Banking) and 1 Unrest per instance. Cannot pre-tax.
- **Movement**:
  - **Navy**: Can move to any region with a ship icon (colonies, Baltic, Mediterranean). Cannot enter German States, Central Europe, or Ottoman Empire.
  - **Army**: Can move to any European region. To move to a colony, a navy must be present in the destination.
  - **Distant Sea Move**: Any move crossing a "rope" (Europe ↔ colonies). Roll 1 white and 1 black die:
    - White > 1: Success.
    - White = 1: Black die result:
      - 1–2: Lose unit
      - 3–4: Return to origin
      - 5–6: Success
    - **Navigation tile**: +2 to black die (or +4 with two).
- **Combat**:
  - **Attack Cost**: $2.
  - **Naval Combat**: Occurs if both sides have a navy (own or allied). Winner gains +1 to land combat strength. Based on:
    - 1 per navy
    - +1 for Naval Training superiority
    - +1 per Local Alliance (naval)
    - Add difference of 2d6.
    - **Losses**: Loser loses 1 unit (army takes priority). Roll of 7 = additional loss. Tie = both lose 1 unit.
  - **Land Combat**: Attacker must have at least 1 army. Based on:
    - 1 per army
    - +2 per defending fort
    - +1 for naval support
    - +1 for Army Training superiority
    - +1 per Local Alliance (land)
    - Add difference of 2d6.
    - **Losses**: Same as naval. Forts cannot be lost in a tie.
  - **Allies**: Can commit armies/navies. Cannot commit forts or tile benefits. Ally losses are chosen by the primary player.
- **Tiles**:
  - **Triangle (△)**: Use once per War.
  - **Square (□)**: Use once per game.
  - **Local Alliance**: Return at end of War.
  - **Trade**: Use once per War for $1 per control marker in a region.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Scoring**: After each War, score VPs in all 11 regions based on control marker count.
- **End Game**: After War III, Phase V:
  1. Reveal Unrest.
  2. Any player with ≥20 Unrest reduces VPs to 0.
  3. Among remaining players:
     - Highest Unrest: −7 VP
     - Second Highest Unrest: −4 VP
     - Ties: All tied players receive the penalty.
- **Winner**: Player with most VPs. Tie: Player with least Unrest wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Colonize/Gold Coast Commerce**: Can be combined with a Special Action. Only one of the two per turn.
- **Passing**: Returning Unrest only if no attack was made.
- **Forts**: Can only move when built. Cannot be moved once placed.
- **Tile Costs**: May require gold, population, or unrest. Pay when claiming.
- **Allied Units**: Can be lost in combat. Non-player units (in 2–3 player games) cannot be lost.
- **Distant Sea Move**: Only one roll per unit, regardless of distance.
- **Tie in Combat**: Both sides lose 1 unit. Forts immune to tie losses.
- **Rolling 7**: Always causes a unit loss (if possible) and Unrest gain, regardless of win/loss.
- **Government Reform**: Reduces Unrest by 2 when claimed.
- **Banking**: Grants $3 (not $6) per taxation, even with two tiles.
