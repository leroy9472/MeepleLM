## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Escape: The Curse of the Temple*, players are adventurers exploring a cursed Mayan temple in search of magical gems and treasures. The goal is to activate all required magic gems and escape the temple before time runs out. Players must cooperate to discover chambers, overcome curses, complete quests, and survive deadly traps—all under the pressure of a countdown.

Victory is achieved only if all players escape before the final countdown ends. Failure occurs if any player remains inside the temple or if key conditions (e.g., cursed gems, quests) are not fulfilled.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- The game proceeds in real-time, synchronized with a soundtrack or sand timer.  
- Players roll dice simultaneously and use results to perform actions.  
- The game is divided into **three countdowns** (or sand timer flips).  
- On each countdown’s end:  
  - Players not in the Starting Chamber lose dice.  
  - Illusion Chambers are removed and reshuffled.  
  - Some chambers trigger penalties or progress.  
- Players explore by discovering new chambers, rolling icons, activating gems, completing quests, and managing curses.  
- The game ends when:  
  - All players escape before the final countdown ends (win), or  
  - Time runs out and someone remains inside (loss).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### **Dice & Rolling**  
- Each die shows:  
  - Golden Mask (reroll black masks)  
  - Black Mask (locked die)  
  - Torch (movement, tasks)  
  - Key (unlocking, activation)  
  - Adventurer (movement)  
- Dice that fall off the table are **permanently lost** (especially under *Lost Dice* curse).  

#### **Movement**  
- Use **Adventurer**, **Torch**, or **Key** symbols to move between connected chambers.  
- Some characters and treasures allow special movement (e.g., Teleport, VoidRunner).  

#### **Chamber Discovery**  
- When moving into an undiscovered edge, draw and place a tile adjacent to current chamber.  
- Some chambers have special discovery rules (e.g., Debris requires 2 Adventurers, 1 Key, 1 Torch).  

#### **Activating Magic Gems**  
- Roll required icons in a gem chamber.  
- Special chambers modify activation:  
  - **Linked Chambers**: At least 2 must be occupied simultaneously; activate gems in 2+ at once.  
  - **Double Chamber**: Must enter through rear entrance.  
  - **Totem Chamber**: Stack 5 or 10 dice (golden/black masks) to activate 1 or 2 gems.  
  - **Maya Calendar**: Gem activation depends on calendar tile match.  

#### **Curses**  
Drawn when discovering a chamber with a purple mask. Examples:  
- **Trap**: Cannot move or discover.  
- **Broken Die**: One die is locked until curse is lifted.  
- **Silence**: Cannot speak.  
- **Doomed**: Cannot escape until curse is lifted.  
- **Weakest Link**: If bearer isn’t in Start at countdown end, all lose.  
- **Really Cursed**: Draw 2 curses when required.  
- **Soul Exchange**: Swap character control with another player.  

#### **Treasures**  
Drawn when discovering a treasure icon and rolling 2 Keys. Examples:  
- **Healing Mask**: All players reroll all black masks.  
- **Double Torch/Key**: Count as two icons.  
- **Teleport**: Move to any chamber with another player.  
- **Extra Gem**: Activate one gem from depot.  
- **Secret Passage**: Create a door between two adjacent chambers (not Double Chambers).  
- **Counterspell**: Discard one curse.  
- **Large Torch**: Current chamber becomes safe until end of next countdown.  
All treasures are **single-use**.

#### **Quests**  
Triggered when specific chambers are discovered:  
- **Chaos Chamber**: All players present draw 1 curse.  
- **Altar Chamber**: Sacrifice 2 dice (same or different players).  
- **Task Chamber**: Complete 4 tasks (roll specific icons).  
- **Tree of Life**: Roll golden masks = 2 × player count.  
- **Ghost Chamber**: Move ghost from Start to Ghost Chamber using 2 Torches.  
- **Snake Pit**: Defeat snake tokens (2 Torches each), then mother snake (5 Torches).  
- **Constellation Chamber**: Players in 5 specific chambers roll 2 Keys simultaneously.  
- **Treasure Chamber**: Move chalice to Exit (requires extra Torch per move).  
- **Obelisk Chamber**: Gems added to depot; must surround chamber to return gems.  
- **Riddle Chamber**: Reveal statues in correct order using dice rolls.  
- **All quest markers must be cleared before escape.**

#### **Special Chambers**  
- **Pit**: Roll 5 Black Masks to activate 2 gems (no rerolls).  
- **Fountain**: Roll 2 Golden Masks to regain 1 lost die (once per player).  
- **Gear Chamber**: Roll 2 Torches to slide a row/column of chambers.  
- **Mirage Chamber**: Swaps with Starting Chamber.  
- **Teleporter Chamber**: Grants token for free travel between it and any chamber.  
- **Exchange Chamber**: Trade a curse for a random treasure.  
- **Time Chambers**: Complete tasks under timer (e.g., 7 Torches in 60 sec).  
- **Prohibition Chambers**: Block actions (e.g., no gem activation) for two 30-sec phases.  

#### **Cursed Gems**  
- Each player has a secret cursed gem.  
- When a **Single Gem Chamber** is discovered, place a cursed location tile face-down.  
- In that chamber, roll 2 Keys to peek at the tile. If it matches your cursed gem, remove both.  
- **No player may escape until their cursed gem is removed.**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use a treasure to escape a curse that blocks movement?**  
  Yes. *Teleport* or *Large Torch* can bypass *Trap* or help reach safety.  
- **What happens if I roll a golden mask while under *Mask* curse?**  
  You may reroll only **one** black mask (instead of two).  
- **Can I use *Healing Mask* to reroll black masks in the Pit?**  
  No. The Pit explicitly forbids rerolling black masks.  
- **Do Illusion Chambers keep activated gems?**  
  No. Activated gems on Illusion Chambers are **removed** when the chamber is.  
- **Can I complete a quest after the final countdown?**  
  No. All quests must be completed **before** the final escape.  
- **What if the draw pile runs out?**  
  Shuffle used/replaced chambers (e.g., Illusion, removed traps) back into the deck.  
- **Can I use *Counterspell* on *Weakest Link*?**  
  No. *Weakest Link* cannot be lifted.
