## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Cribbage is a classic card game for 2–4 players that combines strategy, counting, and hand management. The objective is to be the first player to reach 121 points (or more) by scoring points during play ("pegging"), in hands, and in the crib. The game is played with a standard 52-card deck, and scoring is tracked on a cribbage board using pegs.

### 2. Components  
- Standard 52-card deck  
- Cribbage board (with two or four tracks for scoring)  
- Two or four pegs per player (for "pegging" forward)  
- Optional: Pennies or chips for tracking game wins

### 3. Setup  
- **Determine Dealer**: Players cut the deck; lowest card deals first. Aces are low (1), face cards are 10. In case of a tie, re-cut.  
- **Dealing**:
  - **2 players**: Dealer deals 6 cards to each player. Each player discards 2 cards face down to form the **crib**.
  - **3 players**: Dealer deals 5 cards to each player and 1 card face down to the crib. Each player discards 1 card to the crib (crib has 4 cards).
  - **4 players**: Dealer deals 5 cards to each player. Each player discards 1 card to the crib (crib has 4 cards). Can be played individually or in partnerships (opposite players as partners).

- The crib belongs solely to the dealer and is scored at the end of the hand.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **The Cut**  
   - After discards, the player to the dealer’s left cuts the deck.  
   - The dealer turns over the top card of the bottom portion — this is the **starter card**.  
   - If the starter is a **Jack**, the dealer scores **2 points** immediately and says, “**Two for his heels**.”  
     - This must be claimed before the first card is played.

2. **The Play (Pegging)**  
   - Begins with the player to the dealer’s left and proceeds clockwise.  
   - Players alternate playing one card face up, announcing the **cumulative total** of all played cards.  
     - Card values: Ace = 1, number cards = face value, face cards (J, Q, K) = 10.  
     - Total must not exceed **31**.

   - **When a player cannot play without exceeding 31**, they say **“Go”**.  
     - Other players continue playing if possible.  
     - When no one can play, the player who played the **last card** scores **1 point** (“One for go” or “One for last card”).  
     - If a player reaches **exactly 31**, they score **2 points** (“Thirty-one for two”) — this replaces the “Go” point; **3 points are not scored**.

   - After a “Go” or 31, the count resets. The player to the left of the one who played the last card starts a new round of play.

   - Players must play if able. Failing to do so is a **renege**.

3. **Scoring During Play (Pegging)**  
   Points are scored **immediately** and pegged on the board:  
   - **15 for 2**: Any card that brings the total to exactly 15 scores 2 points.  
   - **31 for 2**: Any card that brings the total to exactly 31 scores 2 points.  
   - **Pair (2 of a kind)**: Two consecutive cards of the same rank = 2 points.  
   - **Pair Royal (3 of a kind)**: Three consecutive cards of the same rank = 6 points.  
   - **Double Pair Royal (4 of a kind)**: Four consecutive cards of the same rank = 12 points.  
   - **Run**: Three or more consecutive cards in rank (not suit), in any order, forming an unbroken sequence. Score 1 point per card.  
     - Example: 5, 3, 4 = Run of 3 = 3 points.  
     - Runs can be longer: Run of 4 = 4 points, up to 7 cards = 7 points.  
     - Cards need not be played in order, but must be the **last played cards** and form a sequence.

   - All combinations are cumulative (e.g., a card can score 15 and a pair at the same time), **except**:
     - “31 for 2” does **not** combine with “Go” or “Last Card” (only 2 points total).
     - “Last Card” does **not** combine with “31 for 2” (only 2 points).

4. **The Show (Hand Scoring)**  
   After all cards are played, players score their hands (4 cards + starter), beginning with the non-dealer and ending with the dealer. The dealer then scores the **crib** (4 cards + starter).

   - **Fifteens**: Each distinct combination of cards totaling 15 scores **2 points**.  
     - Example: 5, 5, 5, 5 = 4 choose 2 = 6 pairs of 5s = 6 × 2 = 12 points from fifteens.

   - **Pairs**:  
     - Pair (2 of a kind): 2 points  
     - Pair Royal (3 of a kind): 6 points (includes three pairs)  
     - Double Pair Royal (4 of a kind): 12 points (includes six pairs)

   - **Runs**:  
     - Run of 3: 3 points  
     - Run of 4: 4 points  
     - Run of 5: 5 points  
     - **Double Runs**: A run of 3 with a pair (e.g., 3,4,5,5) = 6 points (2 runs of 3) + 2 for pair = 8 total.  
     - **Triple Run**: Three of a kind in a run (e.g., 4,4,4,5,6) = 3 runs of 3 (9 points) + 3 pairs (6 points) = 15.  
     - **Quadruple Run**: Two pairs in a run of 3 (e.g., 5,5,6,6,7) = 4 runs of 3 (12 points) + 2 pairs (4 points) = 16.

   - **Flushes**:  
     - **Hand**: 4 cards of same suit = 4 points (starter not required).  
     - **Five-card flush**: 4 hand cards + starter all same suit = 5 points.  
     - **Crib**: Only scores flush if **all 5 cards** (4 crib + starter) are same suit = 5 points. A 4-card flush in the crib scores **0**.

   - **His Nobs (or "Nibs")**: 1 point if a player holds a **Jack** of the **same suit** as the starter card.  
     - Scored **last**, often announced as “And one for his nob.”

   - **Impossible Score**: “Nineteen” is a traditional way to say a hand has **0 points** (no valid combinations).

5. **The Crib**  
   - Scored **after** all hands.  
   - Scoring rules same as hand, **except**:  
     - **Flushes**: Only 5-card flushes score (5 points). 4-card flushes do **not** score in the crib.

6. **End Game**  
   - Game ends when **any player reaches 121 or more points** (no need to land exactly).  
   - **Skunk Rules (Optional but Common)**:
     - **Skunk**: If a player reaches 121 before opponent reaches 91, winner scores **2 games**.  
     - **Double Skunk**: If a player reaches 121 before opponent reaches 61, winner scores **4 games**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Reneging**: If a player says “Go” when they could have played a card ≤31, it’s a **renege**.  
  - Opponent may claim “Muggins”-style: if proven, **2 points per unplayed card** awarded to opponent.  
  - Can be corrected before next player plays.

- **Muggins (Optional Rule)**: If a player fails to claim points they are entitled to (in hand, crib, or pegging), opponent may call “**Muggins**” and **claim those points**. Applies to missing “his heels” or miscalculating hands.

- **Penalties**:
  - **2 points** for:  
    - Peeking at bottom card or crib prematurely  
    - Moving opponent’s peg  
    - Misplacing starter card (e.g., into hand)  
  - **15 points** for incorrectly claiming game win (e.g., over-pegging and calling game). Offender loses 15 points; opponent gains points equal to overage.

- **Scoring Order**: Always score hands in turn, non-dealer first. Dealer scores hand, then crib.

- **Double-Counting**: Cards may be used in multiple combinations, but combinations must be distinct (e.g., multiple fifteens, runs, or pairs).
