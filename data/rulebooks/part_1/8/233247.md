# Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective
- The goal is to be the first player to complete one agenda on four of the five victory cards.
- Victory is checked before the start of each round.
- If multiple players meet the victory condition, the winner is determined first by the number of victory cards completed, then by most world wonders, then by most friendly spaces.

2. Components
- Leader sheet
- Tech dial
- Focus bar and focus cards (6 types: Culture, Science, Economy, Industry, Military, Growth)
- Control tokens (regular and reinforced)
- Cities and capital cities
- Caravans and armies
- Trade tokens, resource tokens, natural wonder tokens
- Diplomacy cards (player and city-state)
- Event dial and barbarian direction token
- Map tiles with terrain (grassland, hills, forest, desert, mountains, water)
- City-state and barbarian tokens
- Wonder cards and wonder tokens (cultural, economic, scientific, militaristic)
- Fort tokens
- Government tokens
- Victory cards (3 standard, 2 fort-specific)

3. Setup
- Each player chooses a leader, color, and takes matching components.
- Construct focus rows: place 6 basic focus cards in order per leader sheet, Irrigation in slot 1.
- Set tech dials to "0".
- Construct starting map:
  - Place 4 core tiles in center (2 natural wonders, 2 city-states).
  - Each player places fort touching core.
  - Each player places capital tile touching core or fort, then places capital city.
- Populate map: place tokens (barbarians, city-states, resources) matching tile icons.
- Place both copies of each city-state’s diplomacy cards beside the map.
- Set barbarian direction token against map edge.
- Set event dial to "helmet with star".
- Prepare wonder decks: separate by type and era (ancient, medieval, modern), remove random ancient/medieval cards (1 per type for 3p, 1 anc + 1 med for 2p), stack ancient on medieval on modern, flip top card face up.
- Place victory cards: 2 fort cards + 3 random standard cards.
- Place trade and resource tokens in supply.

4. Gameplay Flow
1. Check for victory (before first player’s turn).
2. First player advances event dial and resolves effect:
   - Helmet + arrow: Barbarians move.
   - Helmet + star: Respawn defeated barbarians if space is empty or has caravan/army.
   - District icon: Resolve district effects in clockwise order.
   - Government: Players may change government.
   - Wonder: Place trade token on each faceup wonder; if already has one, remove wonder and flip next.
3. Player chooses one focus card from their focus row.
4. Resolves chosen card’s effect, optionally spending trade tokens.
5. Resets focus row: chosen card returns to leftmost slot (1), others shift right.
6. Next player takes turn.
7. Repeat until a player meets victory condition.
