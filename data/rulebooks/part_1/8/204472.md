## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Sub Terra is a cooperative survival horror game for 1–6 players. Players take on the roles of cavers who have fallen deep into an uncharted cave system and must escape before their flashlights run out. The shared objective is to get as many cavers as possible to the exit tile before the hazard deck runs out or all cavers are lost. The game ends when either all surviving cavers are on the exit tile or there are no conscious cavers left in the cave.

Scoring is based on how many cavers were left behind:
- **Gold (Win)**: 0 cavers left behind  
- **Silver (Win)**: 1 caver left behind  
- **Bronze (Win)**: 2 cavers left behind  
- **Defeat**: 3 or more cavers left behind

### 3. Setup  
1. **Choose Cavers**: Each player selects 1–6 caver boards and corresponding meeples (1 player uses 4–6; 2–3 players use 2 each).  
2. **Assign Health**: Place 3 health markers (+) on each caver board. Return unused components to the box.  
3. **Place Start Tile**: Put the Start tile in the center of the table. Place all caver meeples on it.  
4. **Prepare Cave Tile Deck**:  
   - Shuffle the 64 cave tiles face-down.  
   - Randomly insert the Exit tile into the bottom 5 tiles of the deck (so it's one of the last 6).  
5. **Prepare Hazard Deck**:  
   - Choose difficulty: Normal, Advanced (remove 2 cards), or Expert (remove 4 cards).  
   - Shuffle remaining hazard cards.  
   - Deal:  
     - 4 players: 20 cards  
     - 5 players: 18 cards  
     - 6 players: 16 cards  
   - Place the "Out of Time" card on the bottom of the deck.  
   - Return unused cards to the box unseen.  
6. **Starting Player**: Give the Starting Caver Marker to the player who last went below ground level.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of 4 phases:  
1. **Action Phase**  
2. **Horror Phase**  
3. **Hazard Phase**  
4. **End Phase**  

Repeat until game end.

#### 1. Action Phase  
- Players take turns clockwise, starting with the player holding the Starting Caver Marker.  
- Each caver has **2 Action Points (●●)**.  
- May **exert** for a **third action point (●)**. At the end of the turn, make a skill check (≥4 success). If failed, lose 1+.  
- Actions can be repeated unless restricted.  

**Basic Actions (All Cavers)**  
- **Reveal (●)**: Place the top cave tile on an open side of your current tile (must connect). You may choose rotation.  
- **Move (●)**: Move to an adjacent connected tile. Cannot enter flooded tiles, rubble-blocked tiles, or squeeze tiles without proper actions.  
- **Explore (●●)**: Reveal a tile, then immediately Move onto it.  
- **Run (●●)**: Perform up to 3 Move actions.  
- **Heal (●●)**: Regain 1+ for yourself or another caver on the same tile. Cannot exceed starting health (3).  

**Hazard Actions**  
- **Swim (●●)**: Move into an adjacent flooded tile (has flood marker).  
- **Squeeze (●●)**: Move into an adjacent Squeeze tile.  
- **Dig (●●)**: Remove a rubble marker from your tile or adjacent tile.  
- **Place Rope (●● + skill check)**: If successful, place a rope token on your current Ledge or Slide tile.  
- **Hide (●● + skill check)**: If successful, horrors cannot target you this round (but can still hurt you if they enter your tile).  

**Caver-Specific Abilities**  
- **Diver**:  
  - *Dive*: On a water tile, remove your meeple. On next turn, place on any revealed water tile.  
  - *Amphibious*: Immune to flood damage; can use Move to enter flooded tiles.  
- **Scout**:  
  - *Pathfinder*: Once per game (3 uses), discard a revealed tile and use the next one instead.  
  - *Stealthy*: Cannot be targeted by horrors; not hurt by sharing tile with horror.  
- **Geologist**:  
  - *Excavate*: Same as Dig (●●).  
  - *Intuition*: Set aside top tile face-up at start. When placing a tile, choose between set-aside and new one.  
- **Engineer**:  
  - *Demolish*: Place an explosives token on an adjacent wall (connects tiles). Then resolve a full Cave-In event. (3 uses.)  
  - *Vigilant*: Only lose 1+ during Cave-In (instead of 3).  
- **Climber**:  
  - *Rig*: Same as Place Rope (●● + skill check).  
  - *Agile*: Can use Move to enter Squeeze tiles or rubble-blocked tiles.  
- **Medic**:  
  - *Bandage (●●)*: Another caver on your tile regains 1+.  
  - *Sprint (●●)*: Perform two Move actions.  
- **Bodyguard**:  
  - *Repel (●●)*: Remove a horror from an adjacent tile.  
  - *Protective*: Starts with 3+; other cavers on same tile are protected from Flood, Gas, Cave-In, Tremor.  
- **Leader**:  
  - *Direct (●●)*: Choose another caver; they immediately perform one action (●). Once per turn.  
  - *Experienced*: Only need 5+ to succeed on skill checks (instead of 4+).  

#### 2. Horror Phase  
- If any horrors are on the board:  
  - Each horror moves **1 tile** toward the **closest conscious caver** within 7 steps.  
  - **Tie?** Target caver with lowest rank (number on caver board).  
  - **Cannot target**: unconscious cavers, cavers who succeeded on Hide, cavers on Exit tile.  
  - If no valid target within 7 steps, **remove horror from cave**.  
- Horrors can move through floods, rubble, gas, squeezes, ledges, slides. Cannot move through solid walls.  
- If a horror **shares a tile** with a caver, that caver **loses all + and becomes unconscious**.  

#### 3. Hazard Phase  
- Reveal top card of hazard deck and resolve its effect. Discard it.  
- Five types:  

**Tremor**  
- All conscious cavers make a skill check. Fail → lose 1+.  

**Flood**  
- Place flood markers on all **unflooded water tiles**.  
- All cavers on **any water tile** (flooded or not) lose 1+.  
- After this, **flooded tiles** can only be entered via **Swim (●●)**.  

**Gas**  
- All cavers on **gas tiles** lose 2+.  
- Until next Hazard Phase, **entering a gas tile** (including via Explore) causes 2+ loss.  
- Place Gas Marker near deck as reminder.  

**Cave-In**  
- Roll D6. Place rubble markers on **all cave-in tiles** showing that number and without existing marker.  
- Cavers on newly blocked tiles lose 3+.  
- Rubble blocks entry; clear with **Dig (●●)**.  

**Horror**  
- All existing horrors move **1 tile** toward closest victim (same as Horror Phase).  
- If **fewer than 3 horrors** in cave, spawn a new one on the **closest horror tile** to a conscious caver (within 7 steps).  
- Place Horror Marker on hazard deck as reminder while horrors are active.  

**Severe (x2) Cards (Advanced/Expert only)**  
- Perform effect **twice** in sequence.  
- Exception: **Horror x2** → move all horrors **twice**, then spawn **two** new horrors.  

**Out of Time**  
- Revealed when hazard deck is exhausted.  
- From now on, during every **Hazard Phase**, all cavers **not on the Exit tile** must make a skill check.  
- Fail → **removed from the game** (eaten by darkness).  

#### 4. End Phase  
- Pass the Starting Caver Marker to the next caver clockwise.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Skill Check (●)**: Roll D6.  
  - Base: 4+ = success, 3- = fail  
  - Leader: 5+ = success  
- **Unconscious Cavers**:  
  - 0+ → lie meeple down.  
  - Cannot act or use passive abilities.  
  - Heal via Heal or Bandage to regain + and stand up.  
- **Tile Connections**:  
  - Must share open side (no wall on either tile).  
  - Diagonal = not connected.  
  - "Half-connections" (open side facing wall) = wall.  
- **Tile Placement Rules**:  
  - **Ledge/Slide**: Arrow must point **away** from the revealing caver’s tile.  
  - **Squeeze**: Can only be entered via Squeeze action or Explore.  
  - **Rough Terrain**: Entering requires skill check; fail → lose 1+.  
- **Exerting**: Gain 3rd action point. At end of turn, skill check: fail → lose 1+.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game Ends When**:  
- All **surviving cavers** are on the **Exit tile**, OR  
- **No conscious cavers** remain in the cave.  

**Scoring**:  
Count how many cavers **did not reach the exit**.  
- **0 left behind** → Gold  
- **1 left behind** → Silver  
- **2 left behind** → Bronze  
- **3+ left behind** → Defeat  

**Exit Tile Rules**:  
- Cavers on exit **cannot lose health**.  
- Cannot be targeted by horrors.  
- Unconscious cavers on exit still count as "escaped" if game ends with all survivors there.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I look at a tile before placing it?**  
  No. Announce placement location before flipping.  
- **Can I Run through flooded tiles or squeezes?**  
  Only if your ability allows it (e.g., Diver can Run through flooded; Climber through squeezes).  
- **What happens if a tile can't be placed?**  
  Discard it and use the next tile.  
- **When do I roll for exertion damage?**  
  At the **end of your turn**, after all actions.  
- **Can Medic Bandage themselves?**  
  No. But can Heal themselves for 2●.  
- **Does Bodyguard protect themselves?**  
  No. Their protection only applies to **others on the same tile**.  
- **Can you hide on a horror tile?**  
  Yes, but if horror spawns or moves in, you still lose all +.
