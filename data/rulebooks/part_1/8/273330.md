Failure occurs if the Hunt Track reaches its final space without completing the mission, resulting in campaign loss.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of:  
1. **Start of Round**:  
   - All Hunters discard any number of Stat cards, then draw back up to 3.  
   - Advance Hunt Track by 1.  
   - If advanced onto a red Reset Point: immediately reset the map (see below).  
   - If on final space: trigger Final Round (one last round to complete mission).  
2. **Hunter Turns**: Players take turns in any order.  
   - Perform any number of actions (Move, Interact, Transform Weapon, Attack, Go to Hunter’s Dream) by discarding Stat cards.  
   - Actions may be repeated.  
3. **Enemy Activation**: After each Hunter’s turn:  
   - All enemies on the same tile or connected tiles activate.  
   - Move 1 space toward active Hunter.  
   - If in same space, initiate combat.  
4. **Round End**: After all Hunters complete turns, repeat from Start of Round.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Actions**: All actions (except Attack) require discarding 1 Stat card.  
  - *Move*: Discard 1 card to move up to 2 spaces. Reveal new tiles when exiting map edge.  
  - *Enemies in Pursuit*: After movement, enemies in same space/tile move 1 space along path taken.  
  - *Interact*: Discard 1 card to pick up all Consumables and interact with mission elements on space.  
    - If enemies present: they attack first (flip Action card for each). No dodge or attack allowed.  
  - *Transform Weapon*: Discard all cards on Trick Weapon dashboard, flip to other side.  
  - *Go to Hunter’s Dream*: Discard 1 card to teleport to Dream (voluntary).  
  - *Attack*: Place 1 Stat card on weapon dashboard to initiate combat.  
- **Combat**:  
  1. Select Stat card (place in empty Attack slot).  
  2. Flip top card of Enemy Action deck.  
  3. Dodge (optional): play Dodge card of equal/faster speed.  
  4. Resolve attacks in speed order (>>> > >> > > > 0).  
     - Simultaneous attacks resolve at same speed (damage applies simultaneously).  
     - Stagger cancels slower attacks.  
     - Effects: Poison (1 damage at end of turn), Stun (discard card or take 1), Frenzy (+1 damage taken).  
  - Hunter slain: discard all Blood Echoes, go to Hunter’s Dream.  
  - Enemy slain: gain 1 Blood Echo (max 3).  
- **Resetting the Map** (on red Hunt Track space):  
  - Remove all non-Boss enemies.  
  - Replenish all Consumable tokens.  
  - Respawn mission-related enemies and spawn points (closest first).  
  - Heal Bosses to full (do not reset phase).  
- **Hunter’s Dream**:  
  - Advance Hunt Track by 1 (may cause reset).  
  - Fully heal (6 HP), discard Poison/Frenzy tokens.  
  - Refresh Firearm and Reward cards.  
  - Spend all Blood Echoes to buy Upgrade cards (1 per Blood Echo).  
  - Replace Stat cards to maintain 12-card deck. Unused cards are removed from campaign.  
  - Shuffle new deck.  
- **Bosses**:  
  - Two phases, two Action decks. HP scales with number of players.  
  - Phase 2 triggered when Phase 1 HP is depleted. Excess damage does not carry over.  
  - Heal on map resets but do not revert to Phase 1.  
- **Fog Gates**:  
  - Isolate tile; cover exits with tokens, place Broken Lamp token.  
  - Hunters may enter, but only leave via Hunter’s Dream.  
  - Enemies cannot enter or exit. Pursuing enemies stop at adjacent space.  
  - Removed when mission is completed.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Intelligent and Cruel Rule**: When a game effect allows a choice, always choose the worst outcome for players.

- **Consumables**: No hand limit. "Hunter Turn" use: before or after action. "On Attack": during combat step 1.  
- **Reward Cards**: Max 2 Hunter Tools and 2 Caryll Runes per player. Third must be given away or set aside.  
- **Insight**: Gained by completing Insight Missions. Used for mission requirements.

- **Teleport**: Ignore movement rules; place directly on target space.
