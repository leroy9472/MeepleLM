## 4. Gameplay Flow
- **Per Era**:
  1. Start of Era: Place Era card, add 3rd Market (Era II), add 5th Colony (Era III), replace Head Official with Chief Officer (Era IV), prepare Market and Improvement decks, draw 3 Places.
  2. 5 Years, each with:
     - Start of Year: Reveal Market card, turn over 3 new Places.
     - 2 Half-Years (Summer and Winter):
       - Each player takes 3 consecutive turns.
  3. End of Year: 5 phases — New Starting Player, Add Places (not 5th Year), Redistribute Colonists, Sustenance, Production.
- **End of Era**: After 5th Year’s Production Phase, prepare next Era or end game.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Movement

- Must carry out Place’s action upon arrival.
- **Range** increases via Envoy Colony (Era II) or Stables (Era III), up to 4.
- **Fee**: When moving to a Place with other players’ Stewards (not Markets), pay Fee shown on Era card: 1 Tool or 1 Sustenance good (Food/Robes) + Building resources equal to Era number.
- **Multiple Stewards**: Gain via Envoy Colony (Era I) or Boardinghouse (Era III), up to 4.
