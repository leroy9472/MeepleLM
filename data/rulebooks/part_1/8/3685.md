# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Hammer of the Scots simulates the Wars of Scottish Independence (1297–1314). One player controls the English, the other the Scots. Victory is achieved by controlling a majority of the 14 Scottish noble families at game end. Additional instant victory conditions exist based on key historical figures.

## 2. Components
- Game board depicting Scotland and northern England
- Wooden blocks representing military units (blue for Scots, red for English)
- Noble blocks with faction-specific colors (green = Bruce, yellow = Comyn)
- Cards: 20 Movement (values 1–3), 5 Event cards
- Year marker
- Unit types include infantry, archers, knights, nobles, Wallace, Norse, French knights, Scottish King, and Edward (I/II)

## 3. Setup
- Place noble blocks in home regions per scenario (Braveheart or The Bruce).
- English places remaining nobles (excluding Bruce and Galloway) in home areas.
- Place Cumbria in Lothian, Northumberland in Mentieth.
- Shuffle 13 remaining red blocks; draw 4 randomly to place in England.
- Scots place Bruce in Annan, Galloway in Galloway, Wallace/Douglas/Barclay in Fife, Moray/Fraser in Moray, Grant in Strathspey.
- Shuffle remaining 7 Scottish blocks face-down as draw pool.
- Place turn marker on "1297".
- Shuffle deck; deal 5 cards to each player.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each year consists of 1–5 game turns, each with three phases:
1. **Card Phase**: Players simultaneously reveal one card. Highest Move card or Event card determines Player 1 (English wins ties). Resolve Event if played. If both play Events, resolve both (English first), then end year.
2. **Move Phase**: Player 1 moves all desired groups, then Player 2. Each Move card value (1–3) allows that many Group Moves.
3. **Battle Phase**: Player 1 chooses battle order. Resolve each battle fully before next. Battles last up to 3 rounds; attacker must retreat after round 3 if not victorious.

Repeat turns until all cards played or both play Events in same turn. Then proceed to Wintering.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Movement
- **Group Move**: Any number of blocks in one area may move. Each block moves up to its movement value (2 or 3).
- **Borders**: 
  - Green/black borders: max 6 blocks per player per turn
  - Red borders: max 2 blocks per player per turn; movement stops after crossing
  - Anglo-Scottish border: costs 1 group order per block; blocks stop upon entering England
- **Pinning**: In contested areas, each attacking block pins one defender. Defender chooses which blocks are pinned. Unpinned defenders may move but cannot use borders used by attacker.
- **Norse Movement**: Costs 1 group move. Moves from any coastal area to any other coastal area (except England). May attack, retreat, or regroup to friendly coasts only.

### Combat
- **Sequence**: Defending A → Attacking A → Defending B → Attacking B → Defending C → Attacking C. Within categories, order is player’s choice.
- **Reserves**: 
  - Main Attack: blocks from same area across same border
  - Reserves: all others (attacking via different borders, multiple moves, or defender reinforcements)
  - Reserves enter in round 2
- **Combat Resolution**:
  - Roll dice equal to block’s current strength
  - Hit on roll ≤ combat rating (A3, B2, C3, etc.)
  - +1 to combat rating if noble defends home area (e.g., B2 becomes B3)
  - Hits applied one at a time to strongest enemy block (owner chooses if tied)
  - Each hit reduces strength by 1 (rotate block 90°)
- **Celtic Unity**: When Welsh or Irish blocks are revealed, roll d6: 1–4 no effect, 5–6 return to draw pool
- **Schiltroms (Optional)**: Scottish infantry fire at C4 if no English archers present

### Retreat & Regroup
- **Retreat**: On combat turn, block may retreat instead of firing
  - To adjacent friendly or neutral area
  - Cannot retreat across border used by enemy to enter battle
  - If both used same border, only Player 2 may retreat across it
  - English cannot retreat to Scotland; Scots cannot retreat to England
  - Norse may retreat to any friendly coastal area (not adjacent requirement)
  - Border limits apply per combat round
  - Eliminated if unable to retreat when required
- **Regroup**: After battle, victor may move any/all victorious blocks to adjacent friendly or neutral areas
  - Same movement rules as retreat, except may cross borders used by enemy (border control does not apply)
  - Norse may regroup to any friendly coastal area

### Border Raids
- If Scots occupy England at end of Battle Phase, English must eliminate one non-noble block
- Cannot occur during Truce

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### Victory Conditions
- **Instant Victory**:
  - Control all 14 nobles (Moray must be dead or in draw pool for English to win)
  - Scots win if Edward II eliminated in battle
  - English win if Scottish King eliminated in battle
- **End of Game Victory**:
  - Player with majority of nobles wins
  - Tie (7–7): Scots win if Wallace is on board; otherwise English win

### Wintering Phase (End of Year)
Conducted in strict order:
1. **Nobles Return Home**:
   - English nobles to home areas; if occupied, defect to Scots at current strength
   - Scottish nobles to home areas; if occupied, defect to English at current strength
   - Bruce and Comyn may choose either home area; if both occupied, opponent chooses placement and defect
   - Moray may go home, stay, or disband
2. **Scottish King**: May move to any friendly/neutral cathedral area, stay, or disband
3. **Disbanding**:
   - All blocks in England disband
   - English Archers, Knights, Hobelars disband (except if with wintering Edward I)
   - English Infantry may stay (subject to castle limits) or disband
   - Scottish non-nobles may stay (subject to castle limits) or disband
   - Wallace may move to Selkirk (if unoccupied) and gain 2 strength
4. **Edward Wintering**:
   - Edward I may winter in Scotland or disband
   - Cannot winter two consecutive years or after 1306
   - If he winters, all non-noble red blocks with him may stay regardless of castle limits
   - No feudal levy this winter
   - Edward II cannot winter
5. **Winter Builds**:
   - **French Knights**: Added to Scottish draw pool if Scots control 8+ nobles
   - **Replacement Points (RP)**: Each friendly area generates RP = castle limit (+1 if cathedral present, Scots only)
   - **Scots**: Each RP may be used to:
     - Draw one block at strength 1 (subject to castle limits)
     - Add 1 strength to existing block
     - Multiple uses on same block allowed
     - If Norse/French drawn for inland area, redraw
   - **English**: Each RP may only add strength to existing infantry or noble blocks
6. **Feudal Levy**: Unless Edward I wintered in Scotland, draw half (round up) of English draw pool and deploy at full strength in England
7. Shuffle cards, deal 5 to each player
8. Advance year marker; game ends after final year

### Special Rules
- **Scottish Kings**:
  - Crowned once per game using any Event card
  - **Bruce/Comyn**: Wallace dead, candidate in Fife, announce "Coronation"
    - Bruce crowned → all Comyn nobles defect to English
    - Comyn crowned → all Bruce nobles defect to English
  - **Balliol** (1301+): French knights on map, no prior king, announce "Return of the King"
    - King placed with French knights; all Bruce nobles defect
  - Defection battles resolved immediately; Player 1 chooses order
- **Noble Capture**: When noble eliminated in combat, swap to enemy color at strength 1, place in reserve for next round
- **Permanent Eliminations**:
  - Moray, Wallace, Norse, Hobelars, French knights: removed from game if eliminated in battle
  - Other blocks with black cross: permanently eliminated only if killed in battle or forced to retreat but cannot
  - If removed by Pillage, Border Raids, or winter attrition, return to draw pool

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Movement Order**: Player 1 completes all moves before Player 2 begins
- **Border Limits**: Apply per border segment, not entire border; include all movement directions
- **Pinning**: Cannot be undone by sending in more blocks
- **Norse Movement**: Can move to empty or enemy areas; regroups/retreats only to friendly coasts
- **Sea Move Card**: Can move blocks into or out of England (Norse excluded)
- **Winter Builds**: Wallace and Moray enter at strength 1 if drawn
- **Castle Limits**: Include noble block; zero limit means all blocks must disband
- **Edward I Healing**: Cannot be strengthened with replacement points (only via Victuals/Pillage)
- **Multiple Defections**: Player 1 chooses battle order for simultaneous defection battles
