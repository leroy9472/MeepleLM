## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
- The game is set in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire.  
- The goal is to gain control of the most cities and strongholds by the end of turn 10, or achieve victory immediately by controlling a threshold number of cities/strongholds depending on player count.  
- Victory conditions:  
  - 6-player game: 6 cities/strongholds  
  - 5-player game: 7 cities/strongholds  
  - 3–4 player game: 8 cities/strongholds  
- If no player meets the immediate victory condition, the player with the most cities/strongholds after turn 10 wins.  
- Tiebreakers: highest on Supply track, then most remaining Power Tokens.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Westeros Phase** (skip on Turn 1):  
   - Advance turn order.  
   - Reveal one card from each of the three Westeros decks.  
   - Resolve cards in order (I → II → III). Effects may include supply adjustments, mustering, or Wildlings attacks.  
2. **Planning Phase**:  
   - Players secretly assign one Order token per area containing units.  
   - One-Time Orders may be assigned (one per player, same as normal orders).  
   - Simultaneously reveal all orders.  
   - Messenger Raven holder may replace one of their orders with an unused one.  
3. **Action Phase**:  
   - Resolve Immediate Tactics Cards (if any).  
   - Resolve **Raid** orders in turn order (Iron Throne order).  
   - Resolve **March** orders in turn order; battles occur during March resolution.  
   - Resolve **Consolidate Power** orders simultaneously.  
   - Routed units stand up (recover).  
   - Advance turn marker.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Order Tokens**:  
  - **Raid**: Remove an adjacent opponent’s Raid, Support, or Consolidate Power order. Gain 1 Power Token per Consolidate Power removed.  
    - Land raids land; Port raids sea; Sea raids all.  
    - Special (starred) Raid: remove orders from 2 adjacent areas.  
  - **March**: Move units to adjacent areas or via friendly ship chains.  
    - Only one battle may be initiated per March.  
    - Land units cannot attack sea; sea cannot attack land.  
    - Vacated area can be held with a Power Token.  
  - **Defense**: Grants +1 defense strength (defender only).  
  - **Support**: Units support adjacent battles.  
    - Ships in port support only sea battles; land supports only land.  
  - **Consolidate Power**: Gain 1 Power Token +1 per crown icon in area.  
    - Optional: build a Fortification instead (land areas only).  
    - In ports: only if no enemy ships in adjacent sea.  
- **One-Time Orders**:  
  - **Recruit**: Muster units using mustering points in region.  
  - **Supply Caravan**: Temporarily increase Supply by barrels in region (reverts at next Supply check).  
  - **Forced March**: Move units from adjacent areas into this region.  
  - House-specific variants (e.g., Iron Fleet, Lion’s Cunning) exist in expansions.  
- **Supply**:  
  - Supply limit = number of barrels in controlled regions.  
  - Army size limit applies only to areas with 2+ units.  
  - Excess units must be removed if supply drops.  
  - Leaders do not count toward supply.  
- **Mustering**:  
  - Stronghold: +2 Muster Points; City: +1 Muster Point.  
  - Costs: Footman (1 MP), Knight (2 MP), Ship (1 MP), Siege Engine (2 MP).  
  - Upgrade Footman to Knight or Siege Engine for 1 MP.  
  - Units must be mustered in areas with mustering points or adjacent sea/ports.  
  - Port limit: 3 ships.  
- **Combat**:  
  - **Combat Strength**:  
    - Footman: 1, Knight: 2, Ship: 1, Siege Engine: 4 (attacking cities/forts), 0 otherwise.  
    - Fortification: +1 (defender only); reduces attacking/supporting Knights to strength 1.  
    - Routed units: 0 strength.  
  - **Combat Sequence**:  
    1. Call for support (adjacent Support orders).  
    2. Announce total combat strength.  
    3. Play House Cards (resolve special abilities).  
    4. Valyrian Blade may add +1 (once per turn).  
    5. Highest strength wins. Tie → Fiefdoms track determines winner.  
    6. Loser suffers casualties: (winner’s swords) – (loser’s castles).  
    7. Winner may take a leader hostage instead of one casualty.  
    8. Loser retreats: surviving units to adjacent friendly/unoccupied area (not attacker’s origin).  
    9. Retreated units become routed (placed sideways).  
    10. Siege Engines cannot retreat; destroyed if unable to retreat.  
    11. Defender’s order removed if area conquered.  
- **Leaders**:  
  - Not units; do not count for supply.  
  - Can move with armies; cannot be left alone in an area.  
  - Never routed.  
  - Add strength in battle.  
  - Triggered by discarding matching order; perform a +0 March immediately.  
  - If unable to retreat with army, taken hostage.  
- **Hostages**:  
  - Taken if loser chooses to take one less casualty or leader cannot retreat.  
  - Held in captor’s cell.  
  - Can be executed when “Swing the Sword” Westeros card is played.  
  - Can be traded during hostage negotiations (after Consolidate Power).  
- **Ports**:  
  - Controlled by player who owns the connected land.  
  - Max 3 ships.  
  - Ships may be mustered directly into port, even if enemy controls adjacent sea.  
  - Cannot be attacked directly.  
  - May support sea battles; may raid sea.  
  - Consolidate Power in port only if no enemy ships in adjacent sea.  
  - If land is conquered, new owner may replace port ships.  
- **Special Rules**:  
  - **King’s Court Track**: Limits use of special (starred) order tokens.  
  - **Messenger Raven**: Once per turn, replace one order.  
  - **Neutral Forces**: Can be taken by marching in with sufficient strength; no combat.  
  - **Rivers**: Cannot be crossed without a river crossing marker.
