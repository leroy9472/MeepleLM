5. **Influence Characters**: If you took matching marble pair, pay to gain bonus or take 3 Coins.  
6. **Income and Development**: Gain income from Students, Artifacts, Study/Golem tracks. May upgrade one Development.  
7. **Golem Control**: Pay 1 Knowledge per section Golem is ahead of Student in same district. Cannot pay with VP.  

After round 4, proceed to Final Scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Marble Actions  
- **Work**: Activate up to 4 standing Golems. Cost: 1/3/5/8 Knowledge for 1/2/3/4 Golems. Discount = action value.  
- **Golem**: Take Clay = action value. Spend 3 Clay to upgrade Golem Development or create Golem (3 Clay + 3 per Golem already in district). Creating Golem moves Golem track up 2 spaces.  
- **Artifacts**: Take Coins = action value. Spend 3 Coins to buy Gold or upgrade Artifact Development.  
- **Study**: Take Knowledge = action value. Spend to upgrade Study Development or buy Book card (cost = card cost + board position cost).  
- **Mirror**: Pay 1 Coin to perform any other marble action at its value. Or pay 3 Coins to move up Study track.  

#### Rabbi Actions  
Place Rabbi on available Action tile. Effects include:
- Move Golem(s) up to 4 steps
- Move Student + earn VP
- Upgrade Development
- Kill Golem for VP
- Take resources + draw Objectives
- Activate adjacent Neighborhood tile

#### Students  
- Move when taking colored marbles (yellow/red/blue → matching district; black → any two).  
- Income: Earn resources/VP based on position.  
- Menorah: First to reach section VIII takes Menorah token (end-game scoring).  
- Golem Control: Distance from Golem determines Knowledge cost.

#### Book Cards  
- Buy with Knowledge (colored) or move Student back (black).  
- Tuck into columns (max 5 per column, same color only). Black counts as any color.  
- Gain immediate bonus, then active bonuses from column (bottom to top).  
- Study track level limits total Books per column.

#### Artifacts  
- Complete by covering all 4 gold spaces in a cauldron. Gain immediate benefits and repeat each Income phase.  
- Upgrade with Artifact Development tiles (choose side for grey tiles). Costs depend on placement. Bottom tile costs 8 Coins, reveals 3 yellow Menorahs.

#### Killing a Golem  
- Move to Cemetery, gain space bonus, move Golem track down 1 space.  
- Can be done via action, Book, or Neighborhood tile.

#### Passing  
- Take lowest Pass tile. In Passing phase, remove one marble (Pass 1), then marbles are reset.  
- Second pass triggers final Passing phase.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After round 4:  
- **Golem Area**: Golems built × red Menorahs  
- **Artifact Area**: Completed Artifacts × yellow Menorahs  
- **Study Area**: Book columns (with ≥1 card) × blue Menorahs  
- **Study Track**: VP from top 3 spaces  
- **Objectives**: VP for each completed card  
- **Objective Types**: 2 types = 2 VP, 3 = 5 VP, 4+ = 9 VP  
- **Resources**: 1 VP per 5 total resources  

Tiebreaker: Player with Rabbi highest on Action tiles wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Golem in Section X**: Must move other Golems first. Unused movement → lose 5 VP per Golem (max 5).  
- **Mirror Action**: If no standing Golems, cannot perform Work. Choose action matching uppermost Strategy tile.  
- **Book Placement**: Black Books go to leftmost empty column. If full, place in column with most cards (≤5).  
- **Action Tile Occupied**: Cannot place Rabbi there. Choose next available.  
- **Cannot Afford Control**: Pay all Knowledge; lose 5 VP per uncontrolled Golem.  
- **Optional Bonuses**: All bonuses are optional unless mandatory (Golem movement, Golem track).
