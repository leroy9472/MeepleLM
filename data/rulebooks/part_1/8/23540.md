# Shikoku 1889 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Players are investors in 19th-century Japan, competing to become the wealthiest individual by founding, investing in, and operating railroad corporations across Shikoku. The game simulates the evolution of Japan’s rail infrastructure, with players influencing stock prices, building track, running trains, and managing corporate finances. The winner is the player with the highest net worth when the game ends.

**Objective**: Achieve the highest net worth, calculated as:
- Cash on hand
- Value of owned stock certificates (current market price)
- Face value of owned Private Companies

- **Round Marker**: Moved at end of SR to indicate number of ORs.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Stock Market
- **Zones**:
  - Pink: Starting zone for new corps.
  - Yellow: Shares don’t count toward certificate limit.
  - Orange: Shares don’t count toward limit and no 60% ownership cap.
- **Token Movement**:
  - Up: Corp is “sold out” (all shares held by players) → move up 1 at end of SR.
  - Down: For each share sold → move down 1.
  - Right: Corp pays dividends → move right 1 (up if at row end).
  - Left: Corp withholds → move left 1 (down if at row end).
  - Stacking: New tokens go beneath existing ones in same space.

#### Stock Round (SR)
- **Order**: Priority Deal holder starts; clockwise until all pass consecutively.
- **Actions (any order)**:
  - Buy one certificate:
    - President’s cert: Start corp (pay 2×par; set par ¥65–100).
    - IPO: Pay par to Bank.
    - Open Market: Pay current price to Bank.
  - Sell any number of shares (not President’s unless exchanged).
- **Restrictions**:
  - Cannot buy a corp’s share if already sold it this SR.
  - Max 50% of corp’s shares in Open Market.
  - No selling in first SR.
  - Certificate limit enforced (see below).
  - Cannot exceed 60% ownership unless in Orange zone.
- **Floating a Corporation**:
  - Triggered when 5 shares (50%) remain in IPO.
  - President takes charter, adds 10×par to treasury, places station tokens.
  - “Free” station token placed on reserved city at start of next OR.
- **Certificate Limit**:
  - 2P: 25 | 3P: 19 | 4P: 14 | 5P: 12 | 6P: 11
  - Includes: President’s cert, 10% shares, Private Companies.
  - Excludes: Corps in Yellow/Orange zones.
  - Checked only during SR; excess must be sold by start of next turn.
- **End of SR**:
  - Priority Deal passes to player after last to act.
  - Move stock token up 1 for each sold-out corp.
  - Advance Round Marker to correct OR ring based on current phase.

#### Operating Round (OR)
1. **Private Companies Pay Revenue** to owners (player or corp).
2. **Operating Order**: Descending stock price; tiebreak: rightmost → topmost in stack.
3. **Steps (A–E in order; F optional during turn in Phases 3–4)**:
   - **(A) Lay/Upgrade Track**:
     - One action per OR.
     - Must:
       - Be in corp’s home hex, OR
       - Add new track with connectivity to a station token, OR
       - Increase revenue value of a connected city.
     - Upgrade rules: Yellow → Green → Brown (one rank only).
     - Gray pre-printed tiles cannot be upgraded.
     - Cost: Pay terrain cost (mountain, river, urban) if hex or tile has icon.
     - Restricted hexes (Takamatsu, Ozu): Cannot upgrade until private co. is owned or closed.
   - **(B) Place Station Token**:
     - One per OR; cost ¥40.
     - Must be in open, unreserved city with connectivity.
     - Home token placement (first OR) is free and does not count.
     - Max one token per corp per hex.
   - **(C) Run Trains**:
     - Each train runs one route:
       - Must include at least one station token.
       - No reused track within OR.
       - At least 2 revenue centers; max = train rank (Diesels: unlimited).
       - No skipping revenue centers.
       - No reusing revenue centers on same train (others may reuse).
       - Cannot pass through blocked cities (all spots occupied by rivals); may start/end there.
     - Revenue = sum of center values.
     - Diesels: May use gray off-board values; no stop limit.
   - **(D) Distribute Earnings**:
     - **Pay Dividends**:
       - Pay (earnings ÷ 10) per share to shareholders.
       - IPO shares: pay to Bank.
       - Open Market shares: pay to corp treasury.
       - Stock token → right 1 (up if end of row).
     - **Withhold**:
       - All earnings → corp treasury.
       - Stock token → left 1 (down if end of row).
     - Flip stock token after action.
     - First operation: Corp has no train → always withhold → stock moves left.
   - **(E) Purchase Trains**:
     - Buy from Train Yard (list price), Open Market (list price), or other corp (¥1–treasury max).
     - Resolve one train at a time.
     - **Availability**: Only lowest rank available (except D-trains in Phase 6).
     - **Exchange**: Trade 4/5/6-train for Diesel at ¥800 (exchanged train to Open Market; 4-train rusts immediately).
     - **Phase Change**: Triggered by first purchase of new rank → resolve immediately (rusting, tile availability, OR count change, etc.).
     - **Train Limit by Phase**:
       - Phase 2–3: 4 trains
       - Phase 4–5: 3 trains
       - Phase 6–D: 2 trains
     - Excess trains discarded to Open Market (no compensation) after phase change, starting with triggering corp → descending stock price.
     - **Forced Purchase**:
       - Corp must own a train if it has a route.
       - If no train:
         1. Buy from another corp (optional).
         2. Else: Buy cheapest available from Yard/Open Market.
         3. If insufficient funds: President contributes cash (max needed for cheapest train).
         4. If still short: President sells shares (cannot transfer Pres cert; must comply with 60% limit).
         5. If still cannot afford → bankruptcy → game ends.
   - **(F) Purchase Private Companies**:
     - Only Phases 3–4.
     - At any point during OR turn.
     - Price: ½ to 2× face value (agreed with player owner).
     - Uno-Takamatsu Ferry (G): If held by player at Phase 5 start, does not close but cannot be bought.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End Triggers**:
  1. **Bankruptcy**: Player cannot fund forced train purchase → game ends immediately.
  2. **Breaking the Bank**: Total cash ≥ ¥7,000 → end after current SR + full OR set (or current OR set if during OR).
- **Final Scoring**:
  - Net worth = Cash + Stock value (current market price) + Private Company face values.
  - All holdings public.
  - Bankrupt player can still win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **President’s Certificate Sale**: Only allowed if exchanged for two 10% shares with another player (must result in new majority holder).
- **Ties in Operating Order**: Rightmost token → topmost in stack.
- **Tile Preservation**: Must preserve existing track, cities, towns, tokens, hex letters.
- **Junctions**: Cannot reverse direction (reuses track).
- **Open Market Limits**: Max 5 shares per corp; no Pres cert unless exchanged.
- **Diesel Specials**: Unlimited stops; only ones to use gray off-board values.
- **Rusting**:
  - Phase 4: 2-trains rust
  - Phase 6: 4-trains rust
  - Phase D: 6-trains rust
  - 5+ trains do not rust.
- **Private Company Closure**: All close at Phase 5, except Uno-Takamatsu Ferry if held by player.
