### 4. Gameplay Flow  

The game lasts **3 rounds**. Each round consists of **4 turns per player**, taken in clockwise order starting with the current starting player.

Each turn has **3 steps**:

#### Step 1: Take 1 Die  
- Choose 1 die from the Main Tent.  
- Place it on a vacant Master Card in your play area.  
- You may use the bonus icon on the top half of the card **once** during your turn.

#### Step 2: Determine Power  
- **Power =** value of the die taken + value of all previously taken dice **of the same color** this round.  
- **Do not include Clear dice values** in same-color totals.  
- Optionally, spend **1 matching Gem** to add **+2 Power**.  
  - Clear Gems are wild and can match any die color.  
- If the die is **Clear**, choose one color (Orange, Green, Purple) to represent it for this turn. Its value counts toward that color’s total.

> Note: Clear dice on Master Cards do **not** contribute to future same-color die totals.

#### Step 3: Choose 1 Action  

##### A. Build a Tile in Camp  
- Use your **Power** to select a Build Level (left column of player board) **≤ your Power**.  
- Take the shown combination of **Large** and **Small Camp Tiles** in the **color of the die taken** (or chosen color if Clear).  
- Place tiles in your Camp area:  
  - First tile: anywhere.  
  - Subsequent tiles: must share at least one edge with an existing tile.  
  - Tiles may be rotated or flipped before placement; cannot be moved afterward.  
- If a tile covers a **Bonus Space**, immediately gain the reward.  
- If placing multiple tiles, resolve bonuses one at a time, in any order.  
- If tiles are unavailable, you cannot build them.

##### B. Travel with a Wagon  
- Move the Wagon matching the die color (or chosen color if Clear) **up to your Power** spaces **clockwise**.  
- Gain **1 Gem or Poster** for each symbol passed over or landed on.  
  - **Gems**: Add to storage. Max 3 per color.  
    - If you gain a 4th of any color, take **1 Coin** instead.  
    - You cannot voluntarily take a coin if you have space.  
  - **Posters**: Take from the deck or any face-up card in the display.  
    - Immediately replace face-up cards from the deck.  
    - Place the new Poster above any section of your player board (no Tent required).  
- **Tents**: To collect a Tent token, **end your movement on it**.  
  - Place the Tent on any **vacant** Tent space on your board (except the preprinted leftmost space).  
  - Immediately gain the bonus shown under the space.  
  - After collecting 5 Tents, you cannot take more (but may still stop on Tent spaces).

##### C. Perform a Show  
- Die color is irrelevant; only **Power** matters.  
- Place or move a Hat Figure on the Performance Track:  
  - **1st show this round**: Use the Hat on the board; place it on a vacant space ≤ your Power.  
  - **2nd show**: Use the Hat in front of you; same rule.  
  - **3rd or 4th show**: Move **either** Hat to a new space ≤ your Power (can move down).  
- The space indicates **maximum number of Posters** you can complete this action.  
- You may complete **0–N** Posters, up to the space limit.  

To complete a Poster:  
- It must have a **Tent directly below** it (including the preprinted leftmost Tent).  
- You must have **all required Camp Tiles** in your Camp.  
  - Requirements from multiple Posters are **summed**.  
  - Same tile cannot count for multiple Posters.  
  - Tiles are **not removed**.  
- Discard **required Gems** shown on the Poster (crossed-out icons).  
- If the Tent below has a Gem cost, discard those too.  
  - Clear Gems are wild for all discards.

After completing Posters:  
- Gain **points and coins** shown on completed Posters and their Tents.  
- Advance scoring marker.  
- Flip completed Posters face-down (completed pile).  
- Tents remain in place.  
- You may **reorganize** remaining Posters above your board.

#### Free Action: Use Trainer Tiles  
- At any time during your turn, use **any number** of:  
  - Your own Trainer Tiles (in Trainer Area)  
  - 5 printed Trainer Spaces on the board  
- To activate, place **1 or more** Trainer Markers (from your supply) on the tile/space.  
- Cost is shown on each tile/space (e.g., “2” = 2 markers).  
- After use, return **all used Trainer Markers** to the Main Tent area (they are reused next round).

  - **Round 3**: -3 points per missing coin  
- Points can go negative.

- Players select in **descending order** by Hat position:  
  - Take **1 Master Card + adjacent Trainer Tile** from the display.  
  - Add Master Card to your 5-card set; place Trainer Tile in your Trainer Area.  
- **2-player exception**: If there is **at least one space** between players’ Hats:  
  - Top player selects first, then **discards one remaining pair** before second player chooses.  
  - If Hats are adjacent, no discard occurs.  
- **Note**: No Trainer Tiles are drafted at end of Round 3.

**3. Score a Master Card**

- Replenish Master Card and Trainer Tile displays as in setup.  
  - **No Trainer Tiles** are added after Round 2.  
- Slide all Hats on Performance Track **down to the bottom**, preserving relative order.
