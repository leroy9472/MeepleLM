## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *One Night Ultimate Werewolf: Daybreak*, an outbreak of werewolves has struck the village. Each player takes on a unique role with special night-time abilities. The goal depends on the team:  

- **Villager Team**: Win if at least one Werewolf dies and the Tanner does not win.  
- **Werewolf Team**: Win if no Werewolf dies and the Tanner does not die.  
- **Tanner**: Wins only if they die. If the Tanner dies and any Werewolf also dies, both the Tanner and Villager teams win.  

All roles override the base card via Artifacts or transformations. The game lasts only one night followed by a day of discussion and voting.

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose roles so that there are 3 more cards than players (e.g., 8 players → 11 cards). Include at least one Werewolf.  
2. Shuffle all role cards and deal one to each player.  
3. Place 3 cards face down in the center.  
4. If using Alpha Wolf, place the Center Werewolf card face-down and perpendicular to the three center cards.  
5. Place Shield token and shuffled Artifact tokens near the center.  
6. Players place their cards face down in front of them.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
All players close their eyes. A moderator follows the night wake order:

0. **Sentinel**: May place a Shield token on any player’s card (not their own). A Shield prevents the card from being viewed, moved, or receiving Artifacts.  
1. **Doppelgänger** (if in play): Looks at another player’s card and assumes that role’s night action.  
2. **Werewolves (except Dream Wolf)**: Open eyes to identify teammates.  
   - **Dream Wolf**: Sticks out thumb so Werewolves see them. Does not open eyes.  
   - **Alpha Wolf**: After Werewolves sleep, wakes separately and must swap the Center Werewolf card with a non-Werewolf player’s card (not their own).  
   - **Mystic Wolf**: After Alpha Wolf, wakes separately and may look at one other player’s card.  
3. **Minion** (if in play)  
4. **Masons** (if in play)  
5. **Seer** (if in play)  
5-B. **Apprentice Seer**: May look at one of the center cards.  
5-C. **Paranormal Investigator (P.I.)**: May look at up to two other players’ cards, one at a time. If they see a Werewolf or Tanner, they stop and become that role (and switch teams accordingly).  
6. **Robber** (if in play)  
6-B. **Witch**: May look at one center card. If she does, she **must** exchange it with any player’s card (including her own), placing that player’s card in the center.  
7. **Troublemaker** (if in play)  
7-B. **Village Idiot**: May move all player cards (except their own, center cards, and shielded cards) one space left or right.  
8. **Drunk** (if in play)  
9. **Insomniac** (if in play)  
10. **Revealer**: May flip one other player’s card face up. If it is a Werewolf or Tanner, they **must** flip it back face down.  
10a. **Doppelgänger-Revealer**: If Doppelgänger copied Revealer, wakes now and performs the same action.  
11. **Curator**: May place one random face-down Artifact token on any player’s card (not one with a Shield).  
11a. **Doppelgänger-Curator**: If Doppelgänger copied Curator, wakes now and places an Artifact token.  

After all night actions, moderator says: “Everyone, open your eyes.” Day begins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Shield Token (Sentinel)**: Prevents viewing, moving, or Artifact placement on a card. Blocks Drunk, Robber, Insomniac, Witch, etc.  
- **Artifact Tokens**: Placed by Curator (or Doppelgänger-Curator). Take effect immediately at dawn. Override the base card and remove original powers.  
  - Claw of the Werewolf → You are a Werewolf  
  - Brand of the Villager → You are a Villager (no powers)  
  - Cudgel of the Tanner → You are a Tanner (win only if you die)  
  - Void of Nothingness → No effect  
  - Mask of Muting → Cannot speak (gestures allowed)  
  - Shroud of Shame → Must face away from table; may not look at cards or players  
- **Doppelgänger**: Copies the role they see. Performs that role’s night action **immediately** when they wake. If they copy Revealer or Curator, they wake again after those roles.  
- **Bodyguard (No-Wake Role)**: During voting, the player they point to cannot die. If that player has the most votes, the next player with at least 2 votes is killed.  
- **Dream Wolf**: On Werewolf team. Does not open eyes at night. Sticks out thumb during Werewolf phase so others know who they are.  
- **Paranormal Investigator**: Becomes a Werewolf or Tanner if they see one. Stops looking after seeing either.  
- **Witch**: If she looks at a center card, she **must** swap it with a player’s card.  
- **Village Idiot**: Can rotate all non-shielded, non-center, non-own cards one seat left or right.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
1. **Voting Phase**: All players discuss and vote openly for one player to eliminate.  
2. **Bodyguard Check**: If Bodyguard is in play, reveal who they pointed to. That player cannot die.  
3. **Tally Votes**: Player with most votes is eliminated (unless protected). If tied, all tied players die unless protected.  
4. **Win Conditions**:  
   - **Villagers Win** if:  
     - At least one Werewolf dies, **and**  
     - The Tanner does **not** win (i.e., Tanner does not die, or if Tanner dies, a Werewolf also dies).  
   - **Werewolves Win** if:  
     - No Werewolf dies, **and**  
     - The Tanner does **not** die.  
   - **Tanner Wins** if:  
     - They die.  
     - If Tanner and a Werewolf both die, both Tanner and Villager teams win.  
   - **Artifact Effects**: Apply at dawn. A player who becomes a Werewolf via Claw wins with Werewolves. A player who becomes a Tanner via Cudgel wins only if they die.  
   - **Epic Battle (if Werewolves, Vampires, and Villagers all present)**: At least two players die. Specific team win conditions apply (see source, but not supported by Daybreak-only data).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a Shielded card be moved or viewed?** No. Shield blocks all viewing and moving (including by Witch, Robber, Drunk, etc.).  
- **What if the Drunk’s card is Shielded?** They cannot use their power.  
- **Can the Witch swap a Shielded card?** No — she cannot move or view it.  
- **Can the Curator place an Artifact on a Shielded card?** No.  
- **What if the P.I. sees a Doppelgänger who saw a Werewolf?** The P.I. continues — they do not become a Werewolf unless they see a Werewolf or Tanner directly.  
- **Does the Bodyguard protect during ties?** Yes — if the protected player is tied for most votes, the next highest (with ≥2 votes) is killed.  
- **What if no one votes for the Tanner?** The Tanner does not win.  
- **Does the Shroud of Shame prevent voting?** No — player may still point during voting.  
- **Can a player talk if they have Mask of Muting?** No — they must remain silent (gestures allowed).
