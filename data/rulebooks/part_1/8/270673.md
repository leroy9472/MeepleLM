## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Silver & Gold*, players take on the role of treasure hunters navigating a series of expeditions to uncover hidden riches across a collection of treasure maps. The objective is to earn the most victory points (VP) over four rounds by completing treasure map cards, collecting coins, scoring palm trees, and earning trophy bonuses. Victory points are awarded for completed maps, coin rows, palm tree events, and end-game seal bonuses.

The game ends after four rounds. The player with the highest total VP wins. In case of a tie, it is broken by comparing the number of completed Gray, then Green, then Orange, then Purple treasure map cards.

### 3. Setup  
1. Give each player:  
   - 1 Dry-Erase Marker  
   - 1 Score Card (placed face up)  

2. Shuffle the 47 Treasure Map Cards. Deal 4 to each player.  
3. Each player selects 2 of the 4 cards to keep, placing them face up in front of them. Return the other 2 to the deck.  
4. Shuffle the deck again and place it face down as the **Treasure Map Deck**.  
5. Reveal the top 4 cards from the deck and place them face up in a row — this is the **Open Display**.  
6. Shuffle the 8 Expedition Cards and place them face down as a deck next to the Open Display.  
7. Place the Round Card in the center.  
8. Determine the starting player (any method).  

> Note: The Open Display is always refilled to 4 cards after players take cards during scoring.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **4 rounds**. Each round has **7 turns** (one per revealed Expedition Card). On each turn, players perform the following 3 actions in order:

#### 1st Action: Reveal an Expedition Card  
- The starting player reveals the top card from the Expedition Deck.  
- Place it face up next to the deck (stacked; no peeking at past cards).  
- This pattern applies to all players.

#### 2nd Action: Cross Out Treasure Map Card Fields  
Each player must cross out fields on **one** of their two active treasure map cards, following these rules:  
- Must match the **exact shape and number** of the revealed Expedition Card.  
- Pattern may be **rotated (90° or 180°)** or **mirrored**.  
- Each field may be crossed out **only once**.  

> ⚠️ Alternative: If a player cannot or does not want to use the pattern, they may instead cross out **exactly 1 field** on either map card.

**Special Symbols (triggered when crossed out):**  
- **Cross (X):** Immediately cross out **1 additional empty field** on either map card. If that field is also an X, repeat.  
- **Coin (💰):** Cross out the **next empty coin space** on your Score Card (left to right, top to bottom). Max: 12 total.  
- **Palm Tree (🌴):** Immediately score **1 VP + 1 VP for each Palm Tree visible on the 4 Open Display cards**. Record total in one of your 4 Palm Tree scoring boxes.  
  - Max of **4 Palm Tree scores** per game (each uses one box).  
  - Only display cards count — not other players’ or your own second card.

#### 3rd Action: Score Completed Coin Rows and/or Treasure Map Cards  
Players resolve scoring **in clockwise order**, starting with the starting player.

**Scoring a Completed Coin Row:**  
- If a player completed a full row of 4 coins on their Score Card during Action 2:  
  - Take the **highest remaining Trophy Cup value** from the Round Card (starts at 6).  
  - Write that number in the Trophy Cup space next to the completed coin row.  
  - Cross out the Trophy on the Round Card.  
  - Once all 6 Trophies are taken, no further coin rows earn bonus points.

**Scoring a Completed Treasure Map Card:**  
- If a player fully crossed out all fields on a map card:  
  - Set it aside face up as a **completed scoring stack**.  
  - Draw a **new treasure map card** from:  
    - One of the 4 in the Open Display, **or**  
    - The top of the Treasure Map Deck (if display has <4 cards).  
  - If **both** cards are completed in the same turn, draw **two** new cards.  
- **Refill the Open Display to 4 cards** only **after** the player finishes taking replacements.

> Note: If the Treasure Map Deck is empty, the Open Display may have fewer than 4 cards and is not refilled.

**After Action 3:**  
- The starting player passes clockwise to the next player.  
- Next turn begins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Expedition Card Use:** 7 of 8 are used per round; 1 is skipped. At round end, all 8 are reshuffled.  
- **Pattern Flexibility:** Rotation and mirroring allowed, but shape and size must be preserved.  
- **Mandatory Action:** Every player must cross out **at least one field** per turn (either full pattern or 1 field).  
- **Symbol Triggers:**  
  - X: Chain reaction — keep crossing until non-X.  
  - Coin: Progresses Score Card — enables Trophy scoring.  
  - Palm Tree: Immediate scoring based on display — max 4 times.  
- **Trophy Scarcity:** Only 6 Trophy Cup values (6–1); first to complete a coin row gets highest available.  
- **Map Card Replacement:** Only after completion; taken from display or deck.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after **4 rounds**. Incomplete treasure map cards are discarded and earn **0 VP**.

Each player calculates their total VP as follows:  
- **Coins:** 1 VP per crossed-out coin space (max 12)  
- **Trophies:** Sum of numbers in Trophy Cup spaces on Score Card  
- **Palm Trees:** Sum of numbers in the 4 Palm Tree scoring boxes  
- **Completed Treasure Map Cards:** VP value in top-left corner of each completed card  
- **Seal Bonuses:**  
  - For each completed card with a seal:  
    - Earn **1 or 2 bonus VP per completed card of the seal’s color**  
    - Example: A Gray seal gives +1 VP per completed Gray card  
    - Multiple seals are scored independently

**Final Scoring Example (Sarah):**  
- 6 completed cards → 64 VP  
- Gray seal → 2 cards × 1 = 2 VP  
- Orange seal → 2 cards × 2 = 4 VP  
- 9 coins + 2 trophies → 17 VP  
- 3 palm tree scores → 8 VP  
- **Total: 95 VP**

**Winning:**  
- Highest total VP wins.  
- **Tiebreaker:** Most completed Gray cards → then Green → then Orange → then Purple.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I rotate and mirror the pattern at the same time?**  
A: Yes. Any combination of 90°/180° rotation and mirroring is allowed.

**Q: Can I use the same treasure map card for multiple turns?**  
A: Yes. You may work on either of your two active cards each turn.

**Q: Can I score multiple palm trees in one turn?**  
A: Yes. If you cross out two palm trees (e.g., via X chain), score them **separately**, using two different Palm Tree boxes.

**Q: What if I complete a coin row and a treasure map card in the same turn?**  
A: Score both during Action 3, in turn order.

**Q: Can I look at the discarded Expedition Cards?**  
A: No. The stack is closed. Players may not review previously used cards.

**Q: What if the Treasure Map Deck runs out?**  
A: Continue playing. Open Display is not refilled beyond available cards.

**Q: Do I score trophies immediately when I complete a coin row?**  
A: No. Trophy points are awarded **during Action 3**, when it’s your turn to score.

**Q: Can I choose not to take a card from the display?**  
A: No. When replacing a completed card, you must take one from the Open Display if available; otherwise from the deck.
