## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
After being stripped of their possessions, a mage, barbarian, elf, and dwarf must rob the Magic Maze shopping mall to retrieve essential gear for their next adventure. They must simultaneously steal their matching items and escape before time runs out.  
Objective: All players win if all four hero pawns successfully steal their corresponding items and exit the mall before the sand timer runs out. If the timer empties at any point, all players lose.

2. Components  
- 24 Mall tiles (9 included in print-and-play version)  
- 4 Hero pawns (yellow/barbarian, purple/mage, green/elf, orange/dwarf), each associated with a symbol: sword, vial, bow, axe  
- 1 Theft tile (two-sided: A-side before theft, B-side after)  
- 12 Out of Order tokens (used on Sand Timer, Security Camera, and Crystal Ball spaces)  
- 9 Action tiles (for 2–8 players), 7 for solo play  
- 1 3-minute sand timer (physical required)  
- 1 "Do Something!" pawn (large red token for nonverbal communication)  
- 1 Score-sheet: "The Great Book of Challenges"  
- Optional stickers for colorblind accessibility

3. Setup  
- Choose a scenario (start with Scenario 1).  
- Place starting tile (Tile 1) in the center. Use A-side for initial play, B-side in later scenarios.  
- Randomly place the 4 hero pawns on the central spaces of Tile 1.  
- Set aside the Theft tile (A-side up) and Out of Order tokens.  
- Shuffle Mall tiles 2–N (depending on scenario) into a face-down deck.  
- Distribute one Action tile per player (based on player count), ensuring the North arrow matches the direction of the starting tile.  
- Place Action tiles in front of players where all can see.  
- Players may communicate freely during setup.  
- Flip the sand timer to begin the game—silence begins immediately.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Explore: Use the Explore action to place new tiles when a hero stands on a colored Exploration space matching their color.  
2. Position: Move heroes to their corresponding Item spaces.  
3. Steal: When all four heroes are on their matching Item spaces simultaneously, flip the Theft tile to B-side. The alarm triggers—Vortex actions are disabled.  
4. Escape: Move each hero to their correct exit (same color in later scenarios) before the sand timer runs out.  
- Game ends immediately if timer runs out (loss) or all heroes escape (win).

5. Core Mechanics  
- Real-time play: No turns. Players act simultaneously using only the actions on their Action tile.  
- Actions (only those on your tile may be used):  
  1. Move (arrow): Move any hero any number of spaces in the indicated direction. Movement stops before walls, other heroes, or obstacles.  
  2. Vortex: Move any hero from anywhere to a Vortex space of their color. Cannot be used after theft.  
  3. Escalator: Move any hero from one side of an escalator to the other. Heroes cannot stop on escalators.  
  4. Explore (magnifying glass): Reveal and place the top Mall tile when a hero is on a matching-color Exploration space leading to unexplored space. Align white arrow from the hero’s space.  
- Communication Restrictions:  
  - No talking, pointing, gestures, or sounds during active play.  
  - Permitted:  
    - Staring at another player.  
    - Placing the "Do Something!" pawn in front of a player (can be passed on).  
  - Communication is allowed only when the sand timer is flipped: players may speak freely until any action is taken.  
- Sand Timer:  
  - Flip immediately when any hero moves onto a Sand Timer space.  
  - Each Sand Timer space can only be used once—place an Out of Order token under the hero after use.  
  - Four such spaces exist in the mall.  
  - Flipping the timer grants communication window.  
- Special Hero Abilities (unlocked in later scenarios):  
  - Dwarf (orange): Can move through small doors in orange walls (Scenario 4+).  
  - Elf (green): When used to explore, players may communicate until the next action is taken (Scenario 4+).  
  - Mage (purple): When on a Crystal Ball space, the Explore player may place up to two tiles (connected or not). Place an Out of Order token on the Crystal Ball after use (Scenario 5+).  
  - Barbarian (yellow): Can disable Security Cameras by moving onto them. Two or more active cameras block Sand Timer use (Scenario 6+).  
- Action Tile Passing (Scenario 3+): After each sand timer flip, all players pass their Action tile to the left. Orientation must remain consistent with starting tile.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Victory: All four heroes must steal their items (flip Theft tile) and exit via correct exits (color-matched in Scenario 2+) before the sand timer runs out.  
- Defeat: The sand timer runs out at any point during the game.  
- Scoring (optional): Use "The Great Book of Challenges" to record successful runs and number of Sand Timer uses (fewer is better).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can heroes stand on spaces not matching their color? Yes.  
- Can heroes stand on Out of Order tokens? Yes.  
- Can two heroes swap places using simultaneous moves? No—pawns cannot jump over each other.  
- Can you use Vortex after theft? No—Vortex is disabled after Theft tile is flipped.  
- Can you delay placing the second tile during Mage’s ability? No—once first tile is placed, you must either place the second or immediately place Out of Order token.  
- Can Elf’s communication ability trigger multiple times? Only when the Elf is used to place a tile—ends with next action.  
- What if a tile placement connects two Exploration spaces? Valid—creates a usable passage.  
- Can you explore if multiple heroes are on Exploration spaces? Only the hero whose color matches the space can trigger Explore.  
- Can you use Explore if the drawn tile has no valid placement? No—tile must be placed legally or the action cannot be completed.
