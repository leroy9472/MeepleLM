5. Core Mechanics  
**Phase 1: Draw Demand Tiles**  
- Turn 1: Each player draws 1 tile → used for mid-priced demand  
- Turns 2–4: Each player draws 2 tiles  
  - Turn 2: Higher value → mid-priced, lower → low-priced  
  - Turns 3–4: Higher → low-priced, lower → mid-priced  
- Turns 3–4: Draw 1 additional tile for high-priced demand  
- Turn 4: Draw 1 additional tile for low-priced demand  

**Phase 2: Select Characters**  
- In Selection Order, each player chooses one character (no duplicates)  
- Take R&D cubes and character marker if present  
- Durant: Immediately build 1 factory in empty space (pay all costs)  

Character Abilities:  
- **Ford**: Once during Action Rounds, build 1 factory or parts factory in a space you already occupy (before/after normal action)  
- **Kettering**: Gain 3 R&D cubes (no special ability during turn)
