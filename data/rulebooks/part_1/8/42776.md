## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Horde Unleashed*, the COG forces must survive four escalating waves of Locust attacks. The mission ends successfully only when the last enemy of the fourth and final wave is eliminated. Players must use strategic fortifications, equipment, and grenade traps to hold their ground against overwhelming numbers.

### 2. Components
- Base game components of *Gears of War: The Board Game*
- Mission Pack 1 expansion
- Custom enemy cards
- Location cards (including Equipment cards for Weapon, Ammo, and Grenade)
- Fortification components: Barriers, Decoys, Sentry Guns
- Fortification upgrade tokens
- Map tiles (excluding tile 17A/B during setup)
- Order cards, Weapon cards, Grenade tokens, Ammo tokens
- COG and Locust figures
- Locust AI cards (General and specific to Locust types A, B, C, and D)
- Hammer of Dawn weapon (unlocked in Wave 4)

### 3. Setup
- Select one Weapon, one Ammo, and one Grenade Location card, plus three additional Location cards without Equipment icons.
- Arrange the corresponding map tiles in any configuration, ensuring:
  - No Equipment-icon tiles are adjacent.
  - All tiles are aligned entrance to exit.
- Shuffle Location cards into two face-down stacks: one with Equipment icons, one without.
- Roll a six-sided die to determine enemy composition for the first wave (see Enemy Waves table).
- Set up Enemy cards and Locust AI cards for Locusts A, B, and C. Include General AI cards 2, 3, 5, and 6. Optionally add General AI card 4 for increased difficulty.
- Place COG figures at the map entrance.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Fortification Round** (at game start and between waves):
   - Each COG takes a full turn.
   - Locust Activation is skipped.
   - Bleeding-out COGs are revived for free at the start.
   - Each COG may place or upgrade one Fortification in their current area.

2. **Enemy Wave**:
   - Update and reshuffle the Locust AI deck based on the current wave.
   - Remove any unused dropped weapon tokens.
   - Spawn enemies:
     - Draw one random Location card from the Equipment stack and one from the non-Equipment stack per player (but spawn count is based on wave number, not player count).
     - First spawn location must be from the Equipment stack.
     - In Wave 4, place tile 17A at the map exit and spawn Locust D at its Equipment icon.
   - Enemies are eliminated during the wave; wave ends when no Locusts remain.

3. **Standard Turn Order (During Wave)**:
   - Each COG takes a turn in order:
     1. **Heal**: Draw up to 2 Order cards (hand limit applies).
     2. **COG Order**: Discard one Order card to:
        - Resolve actions on the card (in order),
        - Move up to 2 areas, or
        - Perform one attack.
     3. **Special Actions** (before or after main action, one per action, each requiring a discarded card):
        - Revive a bleeding-out COG in the same area.
        - Pick up a dropped weapon.
        - Activate equipment in the current area.
     4. **Locust Activation**: Draw and resolve top Locust AI card. Resolve each activated figure fully before the next.

4. After the final Locust of a wave is eliminated:
   - COG may finish their current turn.
   - Skip Locust Activation step.
   - Proceed to next Fortification Round (or victory if Wave 4 is complete).

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Fortifications
- Can be placed or upgraded once per Fortification Round per COG, only in the area they occupy.
- Three types:
  - **Barrier**:
    - Stops Locust movement upon entry.
    - Prevents taking cover.
    - If upgraded: Locust cannot attack for the rest of the turn.
  - **Decoy**:
    - Treated as a COG by Locusts.
    - Has 1 defense die (3 if upgraded).
    - Destroyed if it takes any damage.
  - **Sentry Gun**:
    - Makes an immediate 1-die attack (2 if upgraded) when a Locust enters or spawns in its area.
    - Omen results count as hits.
- **Fortification Destruction**:
  - Destroyed if a Locust occupying its area is activated by a Locust AI card.
  - Destroyed by any explosive damage in its area.

#### Equipment
- At the start of each wave, the first Location card used for spawning is placed next to the map.
- Its Equipment effect (Weapon, Ammo, or Grenade) may be used once during that wave.
- After use or at the start of the next wave, shuffle it back into the Location decks.
- In Wave 4, the Hammer of Dawn can be picked up from tile 17A.

#### Special Grenade Rules
- Grenades cannot seal emergence holes. Omen results count as an extra hit.
- A COG with a Grenade token may discard an Order card to leave a **Grenade Trap** when leaving cover.
  - Place Grenade token on the cover space.
  - Any Locust entering the cover space is automatically killed.
  - Grenade Trap does not affect other figures or fortifications.
  - COGs cannot enter cover spaces with a Grenade Trap.

#### Enemy Waves
- Four waves total.
- Roll a d6 to determine enemy types per wave.
- Spawn rules:
  - Spawn enemies based on wave number (Wave 1: solo spawn count, Wave 2: 2-player count, etc.).
  - Locust D only appears in Wave 4.
  - In Wave 4, place tile 17A at the exit and spawn Locust D at its Equipment icon.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory**: Achieved when the last Locust of Wave 4 is eliminated.
- **Defeat**: Occurs if all COGs are bleeding out at any time (standard game loss condition).
- No formal scoring; mission is binary win/loss.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Q**: Can a COG place a Fortification during a standard turn?
  - **A**: No. Only during Fortification Rounds.
- **Q**: Can a Sentry Gun attack trigger on spawn?
  - **A**: Yes. It attacks immediately when a Locust spawns in its area.
- **Q**: What happens if a Locust moves into a Decoy’s area?
  - **A**: The Decoy is targeted and attacked like a COG. If it takes damage, it is destroyed.
- **Q**: Can a Grenade Trap be placed in any cover space?
  - **A**: Yes, as long as the COG is leaving cover and discards an Order card.
- **Q**: Is the Hammer of Dawn available during earlier waves?
  - **A**: No. Only in Wave 4 via tile 17A.
- **Q**: Can Fortifications be placed on any tile?
  - **A**: Yes, as long as the COG occupies the area. No tile restrictions beyond game setup adjacency rules.
