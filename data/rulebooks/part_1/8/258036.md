2. **Choose:** Secretly select **2 tiles** from your hand to play. Place them face-down in front of you.  
3. **Pass:** Place the remaining **7 tiles face-down under the castle token to your left**.  
   - This signals you are done choosing.  
4. **Reveal:** Once all players have passed, everyone reveals their 2 selected tiles.  
5. **Place:** Discuss with your co-builders (players on either side) and **place one tile into each of your two castles** (the one to your left and the one to your right).  
   - You must place **one tile in each castle**.  
6. **Repeat:**  
   - If there is more than **1 tile** under the castle token to your right, pick them up and repeat the process (choose 2, pass rest left, reveal, place).  
7. **End of Round 1:**  
   - When only **1 tile remains** under a castle token, **discard it face-down** (out of the game).  
   - Begin Round 2.

#### Round 2:  
- Follow the same steps as Round 1, **but pass tiles to the right instead of the left**.  
- That is:  
  - After choosing 2 tiles, place the remaining tiles **under the castle token to your right**.  
  - Pick up tiles from the **left**.
