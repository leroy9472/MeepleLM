## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Flip is a press-your-luck card game where players aim to be the first to reach 200 points. Points are scored each round based on the value of Number cards collected. The round ends when a player either "busts" (draws a duplicate Number card) or successfully collects 7 unique Number cards (Flip 7), which triggers an immediate round end and awards a 15-point bonus.

### 2. Components  
- 94-card deck consisting of:
  - Number cards (0–12): The quantity of each matches its value (e.g., twelve 12s, eleven 11s, ..., one 1, one 0).
  - Action cards: Flip Three, Freeze, Second Chance.
  - Score Modifier cards: +2 to +10 (in various increments), and x2.
- Printable scoresheets (accessible via QR code or online).
- Pen/paper for scoring (recommended).

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose a starting Dealer.
2. Shuffle the deck thoroughly.
3. The Dealer deals one card face up to each player in turn order, including themselves.
4. If an Action card is dealt during this phase, pause dealing to resolve it immediately before continuing.
5. After all players have one card, the Dealer begins asking each active player in turn: “Hit or Stay?”

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Initial Deal**: Each player receives one card. Action cards are resolved immediately when dealt.
2. **Hit or Stay Phase**: Starting with the Dealer, each active player chooses:
   - **Hit**: Draw another card. Continue playing.
   - **Stay**: End your turn and lock in your current score.
3. The round continues until:
   - All players have either Stayed or Busted (no active players remain), OR
   - One player successfully collects 7 unique Number cards (Flip 7), ending the round immediately.
4. **Next Round**: 
   - Discard all used cards (do not reshuffle into deck).
   - Pass remaining deck to the left; that player becomes the new Dealer.
   - When the deck runs out, shuffle all discarded cards to form a new deck. If reshuffling mid-round, leave all player cards as-is.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Number Cards  
- Cards numbered 0–12. Quantity in deck equals card value (e.g., twelve 12s, one 1).
- 0 is a Number card worth 0 points but counts toward uniqueness for Flip 7.
- **Bust Rule**: If you draw a Number card matching one you already have, you bust and are out of the round (score 0), unless you use a Second Chance.
- **Flip 7 Bonus**: Having 7 unique Number cards (regardless of order) triggers an automatic round end and awards 15 bonus points.

#### Action Cards  
- **Freeze**:
  - Bank all current points and exit the round.
  - Card and all your cards remain face-up until scoring.
  - You may play it on yourself.
- **Flip Three**:
  - Must draw 3 cards one at a time.
  - Stop early if you Bust or achieve Flip 7.
  - All cards (Number, Action, Modifier) count toward the 3-card total.
  - Drawn Flip Three or Freeze cards are set aside and resolved *after* the current Flip Three, unless you Bust or Flip 7 (then discard them).
  - Drawn Second Chance cards are handled immediately (see below).
- **Second Chance**:
  - Keep this card in front of you.
  - If you draw a duplicate Number card, discard both the Second Chance and the duplicate card to avoid busting.
  - You may only hold one Second Chance at a time.
  - If dealt a second, assign it to another active player who doesn’t have one; if none, discard it.
  - All Second Chance cards are discarded at round end, even if unused.

#### Modifier Cards  
- **+2 to +10 Cards**: Add the value to your total Number card sum.
- **x2 Card**: Doubles the sum of your Number cards only. Apply *before* adding +X modifiers.
  - Example: Cards 7, 11, +8, x2 → (7+11)×2 = 36, +8 = 44.
- Modifiers do not count toward Flip 7 and cannot cause a bust.

#### Scoring Order  
1. Sum all Number cards.
2. Apply x2 multiplier (if present).
3. Add +X modifier values.
4. Add 15 points if you achieved Flip 7.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- After the round ends, all players calculate their score (even those who stayed, froze, or were forced out).
- Record scores.
- If at least one player has ≥200 points:
  - If one player has the highest score, they win.
  - If tied for highest (≥200), all players play one additional round.
  - Repeat until one player has a unique highest score ≥200.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Initial Deal Action Cards**: Resolve immediately when dealt, even if some players haven’t received cards yet. Freeze or Flip Three can eliminate a player before their turn.
- **Freeze on Self**: Yes, allowed.
- **Second Chance Use**: After using, your turn ends; dealer proceeds to next player.
- **Flip Three Chaining**:
  - Drawn Flip Three or Freeze cards during a Flip Three are set aside.
  - If you Bust or Flip 7, discard all set-aside cards.
  - If you complete 3 draws safely, assign set-aside Flip Three/Freeze cards in order drawn. You may give to any active player (or self if alone).
  - Cards take effect in assignment order.
- **Turn Order After Flip Three**: After resolution, dealer asks “Hit or Stay?” to the player immediately clockwise from the one who *received* the original Flip Three (not the one who resolved it).
- **Multiple Flip Three/Freeze Assignment**: Assign in order drawn. If one player receives both Freeze and Flip Three, Freeze takes effect first; Flip Three is discarded.
- **Scoring with Only Modifiers**: You score +X modifiers. x2 scores 0 if no Number cards.
- **Unused Second Chance**: Discarded at round end, even if you were frozen or round ended via Flip 7.
- **Flip Three Resolution**: Card is discarded immediately after use, regardless of outcome.
