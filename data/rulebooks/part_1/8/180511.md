  - Yellow Tokens: worth 1 VP at game end

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Disc Stacking**: When moving to an occupied space, place your Disc on top. Bottom Disc is ahead.
- **Costume Completion**: Bonus is immediate upon placing the third element.
- **Set Symmetry**: Must mirror left-to-right; Yellow Tokens act as wildcards.
- **+3 Token Use**: Can only use one per activation; cannot use in same turn it’s acquired.
- **Assistant Effect**: Applies only to Craftsmen (not Actors), adds +1 per Assistant.
- **Backstage Activation**: Recruitment Card can substitute for 1 Cylinder.
- **Initiative Track**: Only Actors (not Craftsmen) grant Initiative on first activation.
- **Objective Cards**: Some are immediate (black-white mask), others are end-game.
- **Fire-a-Character**: Exempts from payment but still counts for scoring (e.g., Actor count).
