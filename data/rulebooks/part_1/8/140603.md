## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the role of privateer captains emulating Francis Drake, mounting three voyages from Plymouth to the Spanish Main. The goal is to plunder Spanish towns, forts, and galleons, trade at ports, and return to England with the greatest amount of loot and glory. Victory Points (VP) are earned through successful attacks, trade, end-game commodities, treasure, and voyage-based bonuses. The player with the highest VP total after three voyages wins. Ties are broken by the order of ships in the Homebound Docks at the end of the third voyage.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **3 voyages**, each with two phases:

#### A. Provisioning Phase  
1. **Determine Starting Order**:  
   - Randomly draw Frigates from a cup and place them in Homebound Docks 1–5. This sets player order.  
   - Last player receives 1 Gun (only on Voyage 1).  
2. **Place Discs & Acquire Resources**:  
   - In starting order, players place one Player Disc per turn on an empty circle in Plymouth Street.  
   - Movement is forward-only; players may skip ahead but cannot go back.  
   - Players may place only one disc per Location (except Drake, which requires two consecutive turns).  
   - After placing a disc, take the resources shown (Crew, Guns, Supplies, etc.).  
   - Players may instead choose to **end provisioning** by moving their ship to the lowest-numbered empty Outbound Dock.  
   - If a player stops at Dockside, they must sail next turn.  
   - Once all ships are in Outbound Docks, the **Sailing Order** is set (by dock position).  

#### B. Sailing Phase  
1. **Prepare for Sailing**:  
   - Place 1 Silver on each Silver-marked Town/Fort; 1 Gold on each Gold-marked Town/Fort; 1 Jewel on each Galleon.  
   - **Admiral Holder**: Places one Spanish Frigate Counter face-down next to each Galleon.  
   - **Governor Holder**: Places one Spanish Troop Counter face-down on each Fort.  
   - **Governor Holder**: Swaps position with the player one dock ahead in Outbound Docks (improves sailing order).  
   - Each player places one of their remaining Player Cubes on the Navigation Marker matching their Supply count (max 4). This limits travel to Zones 1–4.  
2. **Sail (Mission Placement)**:  
   - In Sailing Order, each player places one Mission Disc (face-down) on the first circle of any Destination within their reachable zones.  
   - Only one disc per player per Destination.  
   - Discs may be placed in any number order (e.g., Mission 4 first).  
   - All players place all 4 Mission Discs (or fewer, if chosen).  
3. **Informer Ability**:  
   - After all discs are placed, the Informer holder may:  
     - Look at all discs at one Destination where they are present, then swap any two of their own discs.  
     - Look at the defense (Troop or Frigate Counter) at one of their Destinations, then move that disc to another reachable, unoccupied Destination.  
4. **Turn Discs Face-Up**:  
   - Reveal all discs.  
   - At each Destination, arrange discs in order:  
     - Golden Hind first (if present)  
     - Then by number (1, 2, 3, 4)  
     - Ties broken by Sailing Order  
   - Only the first two discs can attack; others wait in reserve.  
   - **Ghost Ship Disc**: Removed after reveal (player sees all choices but acts last).  
5. **Resolve Missions**:  
   - In Sailing Order, players resolve missions:  
     - Golden Hind resolves first.  
     - Then Mission 1s, Mission 2s, etc.  
   - At each Destination, players sail their ship to the disc and resolve:  
     - **Attack Town**: Spend 1 Crew. Gain VP (shown on tile). First attacker takes Gold or Silver.  
     - **Attack Fort**: Spend Crew equal to (printed Troops + hidden Troop Counter) and Guns equal to printed Guns. Pinnace allows ignoring Guns. First attacker takes Gold or Silver.  
     - **Attack Galleon**: Spend Guns equal to (printed Guns + hidden Frigate Guns). First attacker takes Jewel.  
     - **Trade**: Spend 1 Trade Good (purple cube) to take one available Commodity. First trader chooses; others pick from remaining.  
   - Only two successful attacks per Destination. Failed or passed missions return the disc to supply.  
6. **Return to Plymouth**:  
   - After any mission, a player may return to Homebound Harbour.  
   - Must return after fourth mission.  
   - **Hero’s Bonus**: First player back gets +2 VP, second gets +1 VP — **if** they successfully attacked at least one Town, Fort, or Galleon and did not complete all four missions.  
7. **Scoring the Voyage**:  
   - **Types of Conquests Bonus**:  
     - 1 type attacked (Town, Fort, or Galleon): +1 VP  
     - 2 types: +4 VP  
     - 3 types: +10 VP  
   - **Admiral Holder**: +1 VP per unclaimed Gold on board  
   - **Governor Holder**: +1 VP per unclaimed Silver on board  
8. **Reset the Board**:  
   - Return all resources (cubes, barrels, counters, treasure) to supply.  
   - Commodities are kept.  
   - Ships revert to Frigates.  
   - Set new starting order:  
     - Order by score (lowest score in Dock 1, etc.)  
     - Ties retain previous Sailing Order  
   - Shuffle and lay Location Tiles over first 16 Plymouth Street positions.  
   - Shuffle Galleon Counters and place one on each galleon icon.  
   - Replenish treasures and commodities.  
   - Advance Voyage Marker.  

Voyages 2 and 3 proceed identically, using the reset starting order.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Crew (Grey Cubes)**: Required to attack Towns and Forts (equal to total Troops).  
- **Guns (Black Cubes)**: Required to attack Forts and Galleons (equal to total Guns).  
- **Supplies (Barrels)**: Determine maximum zone reachable (1 per zone; 4 needed for Zone 4).  
- **Trade Goods (Purple Cubes)**: Traded 1:1 at Trade Ports for Commodities.  
- **Pinnace**: Allows attacking Forts without spending Guns.  
- **Galleon Ship**: Required to attack Spanish Galleons.  
- **Golden Hind Disc**: Always resolves first.  
- **Ghost Ship Disc**: Allows extra disc placement; removed after reveal.  
- **Investor Tile**: Spend 4 VP to gain either:  
  - 1 Crew + 2 Guns, or 2 Crew + 1 Gun  
  - Or exchange Frigate for Galleon  
  (usable once per game)  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After **Voyage 3**, final scoring occurs:

#### 1. Commodities  
Using the **Commodities Chart**:  
- Each set of **4 different** Commodities: **26 VP**  
- Each set of **3 different**: **16 VP**  
- Each set of **2 different**: **8 VP**  
- Each **single** Commodity: **2 VP**  
(Multiples can form multiple sets.)

#### 2. Treasure Chest  
- **Silver**: 3 VP each  
- **Gold**: 4 VP each  
- **Jewels**: 5 VP each  

**Total VP =** Voyage bonuses + Commodities + Treasure + any unclaimed bonuses  

**Winner**: Highest total VP.  
**Tiebreaker**: Order of ships in Homebound Docks after Voyage 3 (earlier dock = higher rank).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I attack a Destination with no disc?** No. Must have a disc placed.  
- **Can I trade at the same port twice?** No. Only one trade per player per port per voyage.  
- **What if two players tie for first attack?** Sailing Order breaks ties.  
- **Can I use the Informer to look at a defense I’m not attacking?** No. Must have a disc at that Destination.  
- **Do I lose resources if I fail an attack?** No. Only spend if successful.  
- **Can I use the Pinnace on multiple Forts?** Yes. One Pinnace covers all Fort attacks this voyage.  
- **Can I return to Plymouth without attacking?** Yes, but **no Hero’s Bonus** unless at least one successful attack was made.  
- **What happens to unclaimed treasure?** Returned to supply; VP awarded to Admiral (Gold) or Governor (Silver).
