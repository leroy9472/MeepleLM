## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Lead a team of Jedi and Republic clone troopers in a desperate campaign to halt the spread of Separatist droid forces across the galaxy. Inspired by *Pandemic*, players must complete missions, destroy droid threats, and defeat a powerful villain before the threat overwhelms the Republic.

**Goal**: Complete all mission objectives and fulfill the finale conditions of the chosen villain to win. If the Threat Marker reaches its final space, the Republic falls and players lose.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On each player’s turn, follow these **4 steps in order**:

#### Step 1: Ready Cards  
- Ready all exhausted Squad cards in your hand.

#### Step 2: Take 4 Actions  
You may take any of the following actions, in any order, up to 4 times (repeat allowed):

- **Fly**: Move your Jedi to any connected planet. Enemy presence does not block movement.  
- **Reinforce**: Draw 1 Squad card. After drawing, if you have more than 7 cards, discard or play Ally cards until you have 7.  
- **Attack**:
  - Roll the die.
  - For each hit rolled, deal 1 damage to one or more enemies (droids, blockades, villains) on your planet.
  - Any number of Jedi on the planet may exhaust **Attack** or **Stealth** (but not both types) Squad cards to add hits.
  - Ally cards may be discarded to apply their effects.
  - Droids: 1 health; Blockades: 2 health; Villains: health varies (see Villain Sheet).
  - Damage is not cumulative — blockades and villains must be destroyed in a single action.
  - **Return Damage**: For each remaining enemy on the planet and each hit shown on the die, suffer 1 damage. Other players may prevent damage by exhausting Squad cards or discarding Ally cards (any Jedi may help).
- **Attempt Mission**:
  - Only allowed if **no blockade or villain** is present on the planet.
  - Roll the die.
  - Any number of Jedi on the planet may exhaust Squad cards **matching the mission type** or discard Ally cards to add successes.
  - Total successes must meet or exceed the mission requirement **in a single action**.
  - **If successful**:
    - Current Jedi suffers damage equal to hits on the die **and** hits on the mission card.
    - Resolve “When Completed” effect, if any.
    - Return mission card to the box.
    - Draw the next Mission Card, resolve “When Drawn” if applicable, and place its marker on the correct planet.
    - If Mission Deck is empty, place both mission markers on the same planet.
    - If all missions are complete, proceed to **Finale**.
  - **If failed**:
    - Current Jedi suffers only damage from the die (not from the mission card).

**Other Actions (not counted toward 4 actions)**:
- Use **Jedi Special Ability** once per turn (on your own turn only).
- Play **Ally cards**: Discarded when used, not exhausted.
- **Squad Card actions** exhaust when used.

#### Step 3: Activate Villain  
- If Villain Deck has a “!” Reminder Marker, resolve its effect.
- Draw 1 Villain Card and resolve its effect, then discard it.
- Some Villain Decks include **Planet Under Siege**:
  1. Advance Invasion Marker 1 space (if at end, advance Threat instead).
  2. Draw the **bottom** card of the Invasion Deck and add droids until the planet has 3 droids total.
  3. Shuffle the Invasion Discard pile and place it facedown on top of the Invasion Deck.
- “Top Planet” refers to the planet shown on the top card of the Invasion Discard pile.

#### Step 4: Invade Planets  
- Flip over a number of Invasion Cards equal to the current **Invasion Rate** (indicated by Invasion Track marker).
- For each card:
  - Place 1 droid on the matching planet.
  - If the planet already has 3 droids:
    - Do **not** place a 4th.
    - Advance Threat Marker 1 space.
    - Place 1 Blockade on the planet.
  - If no droids remain in supply (36 total), advance Threat Marker 1 per droid you cannot place.
  - If no Blockades remain, advance Threat Marker 1 per Blockade you cannot place.
- Discard each Invasion Card after resolving.

After this, play passes to the next player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Damage & Prevention  
- Damage is suffered by the current Jedi unless prevented.
- Prevent damage by exhausting Squad cards or discarding Ally cards (any Jedi may help).
- Discard cards from hand to prevent damage. If no cards in hand, excess damage has no effect.

#### Card Types  
- **Squad Cards**: Exhaust when used. Can add hits or successes. Only one type (red/purple) can be used per action.
- **Ally Cards**: Discarded when used. Effects may be played on any player’s turn.
- **Hand Limit**: 7. During Reinforce, you may exceed 7, but must reduce to 7 by discarding or playing Ally cards.

#### Enemy Types  
- **Droids**: 1 health. Removed with 1 damage. Do **not** cause damage during Attempt Mission.
- **Blockades**: 2 health. Must be destroyed in one action. Prevent mission attempts.
- **Villains**: Health as specified on Villain Sheet. Prevent mission attempts. Can be engaged during Finale.

#### Mission Rules  
- Missions can be attempted even if droids are present — only blockades and villains block attempts.
- Mission cards like “Hostage Crisis” or “The Lost One” have special rules:
  - If named card is already in hand, do **not** add it again.
  - “The Lost One”: Place all villains on Oba Diah, regardless of current board state. If Count Dooku is villain, place all 3 villains.

  2. Resolve **Finale Setup**.
  3. Ignore original side; only use Finale effects.
  4. Fulfill the victory conditions listed on the Finale side.
  5. During Finale, missions may be attempted **even on planets with a villain**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Empty Decks**: If any deck is empty when drawing, shuffle its discard pile to form a new deck and continue.
- **Ally Cards**: May be played on **any player’s turn**.
- **Return Damage**: During Attack, each **remaining enemy** causes 1 damage, plus damage from die hits.
- **Mission Attempts**: Droids do **not** prevent missions. Only blockades and villains do.
- **Hand Limit**: You may temporarily exceed 7 cards during Reinforce, but must resolve down to 7.
- **Damage Overflow**: If no cards in hand, extra damage has no effect.
- **Villain Options**: If a Villain Card gives a choice (e.g., travel direction), players choose or decide randomly.
- **Solo Mode**: Play with 2 Jedi. Keep hands separate. Use Solo Marker to indicate whose turn it is.
