### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Mosaic: A Story of Civilization*, players guide an ancient civilization from its founding, making strategic decisions to expand cities, develop technologies, construct wonders, and dominate regions. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) through a combination of territorial control, cultural achievements, economic strength, and monumental construction. Victory is determined at the end of the game through a final scoring round.

### 2. Components

- 4 types of currency: Stone, Food, Ideas, and Money (Coins)
- Player boards (6) to track production, population, and trade goods
- 12 City tiles, 3 Port City tiles, 6 Farm Town tiles, 6 Manufactory Town tiles (per player)
- Military units: Infantry, Cavalry, Siege Engines (per player)
- Population tokens (per player)
- Wooden cubes (60) for tracking production and resources
- 105 Technology cards (including 39 Starting Technologies)
- 38 Build cards
- 20 Population cards
- 20 Tax & Tariff cards

- Fish tiles (10)
- Starting Player token

### 3. Setup
1. **Board Setup**:  
   - Place the board. Regions not in play (Hispania for 3 players, Hispania and Gaul for 2 players) receive no tiles and are unscorable.
   - Place Fish tiles on all Port hexes.
   - Place one facedown Cache tile on each Cache space. Flip all face up and remove 'X' tiles.
   - Place one Trade Goods tile on each valid hex (all six sides exposed), flip face up, remove 'X' tiles.

2. **Decks**:
   - **Technology Deck**: Shuffle all Technology cards, including Empire Scoring card (placed in bottom/middle third depending on player count). Place deck and reveal 5 cards.
   - **Build Deck**: Shuffle Build cards with Empire Scoring card in bottom half. Reveal 5 cards.
   - **Population Deck**: Count 10 (2–3p), 12 (4–5p), or 14 (6p) cards. Include Empire Scoring card in bottom half. Reveal 2 cards.
   - **Tax & Tariff Deck**: Same as Population, equal Tax and Tariff cards. Reveal 2 cards.

3. **Player Setup**:
   - Each player chooses a color, takes player board, 5 Population, 5 Wooden Cubes, and 5 random Starting Technologies.
   - Draft: Each player selects one of five Starting Techs, passes rest left, repeats until all have 5.
   - Choose Leader (special power and starting benefits).
   - Starting player selected; players place starting City clockwise.
     - Take Trade Good or Cache benefit if present.
   - Activate Leader and Starting Tech benefits.

4. **Other**:
   - Place 9 Wonder tiles, 9 Golden Age tiles, 6 Government tiles, and 9 random Civilization Achievement tiles next to board.
   - Place Empire Scoring cards in respective decks as specified.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Play proceeds in rounds. Starting player goes first, then clockwise.
- On a turn, a player performs **one** of eight actions:
  1. **Work**: Produce Stone, Food, or Ideas = Population + Production.
  2. **Population**: Buy a Population card (cost in Food) to increase Population. After deck is empty, gain 2 Population for 15 Food.
  3. **Build**: Choose a Build card (or build without card):
     - **City**: 4 Stone + 2 Population. Place anywhere. Add 5 Money to Holding Area.
     - **Port City**: 4 Stone + 2 Population. Place on Port hex. Gain Fish tile (+3 Food Production). Add 10 Money to Holding Area.
     - **Town (Farm/Manufactory)**: Free. Place adjacent to your City.
     - **Project**: 5 Stone + 5 Ideas. Scores 1 VP per matching Pillar of Civilization at game end.
  4. **Wonder**: Build a Wonder:
     - First costs 20 Stone + 5 Food. Each subsequent costs +5 Stone and +5 Food.
     - Place Wonder token in a region with at least one of your Cities.
     - Some have placement restrictions (e.g., Colossus on Port, Pyramids in region with ≥3 Cities, one yours).
  5. **Technology**: Pay 5 Ideas, take one of 5 available cards.
     - If you have required Pillars of Civilization symbols (face-up cards), play it immediately.
     - Otherwise, keep face-down and play later as free action.
  6. **Tax & Tariff**: Choose a card:
     - Gain Money shown + all Money in Holding Area.
     - Track Unrest from card.
     - After deck is empty: Tax = 2×(Population + Govt Symbols) + Tax Production; Tariff = 2×(Unique Trade Goods + Cities) + Tariff Production. No Unrest.
  7. **Military**:
     - **Recruit**: Spend 5 Money per unit (Infantry/Cavalry; Siege Engine if unlocked). Place in region with your City. Max 2 per turn unless modified.
     - **Move**: Spend 1 Money per unit to move to adjacent region. Units can move only once per turn.
     - Adjacent regions: Italia–Numidia, Italia–Greece, Hispania–Numidia, Numidia–Egypt. Greece and Egypt are not adjacent.
  8. **Government**: Buy any Government tile if you meet Pillar requirements.
     - Only one Government at a time; return old one when buying new.
     - Once per game per tile: Refresh any card offer (move cards to bottom, refill).
- After turn: Refill any card offers if cards were taken.
- **Anytime Actions**:
  - Play face-down Technology cards if requirements met.
  - Claim Golden Age (6 of one Pillar) or Civilization Achievement if conditions met.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Pillars of Civilization**: Symbols on cards (Science, Economy, Food, etc.) used as prerequisites for Technologies and Governments.
- **Influence**: Used in Empire Scoring:
  - City/Port City/Wonder: 2 Influence
  - Town: 1 Influence
  - Land Unit: 1 Influence
  - Naval Unit: 2 Influence
- **Money Exchange**: 2 Money = 1 Stone/Food/Ideas (not Population).
- **Trade Goods**: Acquired when building on hexes. Stack duplicates. Unique types count toward Tariff and Manufactory Town scoring.
- **Unrest**: Tracked from Tax & Tariff cards. Reduced by Wonders, Leaders, or Techs. Net Unrest subtracted from final score.
- **Empire Scoring Trigger**: When an Empire Scoring card is drawn, scoring occurs after the player finishes their turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Game End Triggers** (whichever comes first):
- Third Empire Scoring card revealed.
- Two of three sets (Wonders, Golden Ages, Civilization Achievements) fully claimed.

When triggered:
1. Perform Empire Scoring.
2. Finish current round (up to but not including starting player).
3. Play one final full round. Ignore any fourth Empire Scoring card.

**Final Scoring**:
- **Empire Scoring** (occurs 3 times):
  - Most Influence in region: 3 VP + 1 VP per City/Wonder in region (all players).
  - Second-most Influence: 2 VP.
  - Tie for first: all tied score full amount.
  - Tie for second: no one scores.
  - Government tiles provide additional VP (e.g., Tyranny: 2–3 VP/region with control).
- **End Game Scoring**:
  - Cities: 2 VP each
  - Towns: 1 VP each
  - Wonders: VP as shown on tile (some scale with board state)
  - Golden Ages & Civilization Achievements: VP as shown (6 VP typical)
  - Projects: 1 VP per matching Pillar of Civilization symbol owned
  - Technology Cards: VP as shown (shield icon)
  - Manufactory Towns: 5 VP each if you own all three trade goods shown
  - Unrest: Subtract net Unrest (total minus reductions) in VP
- **Win Condition**: Highest VP wins. Tiebreakers: most Wonders, then most Money.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Population Reduction**: Can go to zero, but must have 2 Population to build a City.
- **Starting City**: Must be a regular City, not a Port City.
- **Holding Area**: Money only added when building Cities/Port Cities via Build action, not via effects.
- **Free Cities/Towns**: Placing via card effect does not allow taking a Build card.
- **Control**: Having most Influence without tie. Ties do not count as control.
- **Card Refresh**: Occurs at end of turn. Bonus actions (e.g., from "Mathematics") use current offer.
- **Trade Goods**: "?" tile is wild (from "Craftsmanship" Tech).
- **Production Conversion**: Tax/Tariff production can be converted (e.g., via "Schools of Thought").
- **Achievement Retention**: Once claimed, Golden Age or Achievement cannot be lost.
- **Farm Town without Card**: No food bonus; only card provides extra benefit.
- **Wonder Scoring**: Counts all players' pieces (e.g., Sphinx scores 4 VP per Wonder in region).
