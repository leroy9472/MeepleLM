## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the aftermath of a war, the king’s castles lie in ruins. The aging king tasks his sons (the players) with rebuilding the castles to determine who will inherit the throne. Players use knights to supervise construction, building towers and positioning knights high within castles to earn points. The goal is to accumulate the most points over three phases (years) by maximizing the product of castle surface area and the level of your highest knight in each castle. Bonus points may be earned via the king’s presence and strategic positioning.

2. Components  
- 1 game board (8×8 grid with scoring track around the edge)  
- 92 tower blocks (in 4 colors)  
- 24 knights (6 per player in 4 colors)  
- 4 scoring markers  
- 1 king figure  
- 40 Action cards (mixed colors)  
- 4 Codex cards (player aid summarizing actions)  
- 3 Phase cards (for 2, 3, or 4 players)  
- 8 Master cards (used only in advanced variant)  

3. Setup  
- Place the board in the center.  
- Each player selects a color and takes:  
  - 6 knights  
  - 1 scoring marker  
  - 1 Codex card  
- Place scoring markers at “0” on the scoring track.  
- Place tower blocks in a common supply beside the board.  
- Place 8 tower blocks on the designated foundation spaces to form 8 starting castles (1 block each).  
- Place the king beside the board.  
- Shuffle Action cards and place face down next to the board.  
- Select and reveal the Phase card matching the number of players; return others to the box.  
- Starting with the youngest player and proceeding clockwise, each player places one knight on a different empty castle foundation.  
- The last player places the king on any unoccupied castle foundation (this becomes the king’s castle for Phase 1).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game is played over 3 phases.  
- **Before each phase**:  
  - Players receive tower blocks from the common supply according to the Phase card. These are arranged into stacks (e.g., 4 stacks of 2 blocks each in Phase 1 for 4 players).  
- **Each phase consists of multiple rounds**:  
  - Phase 1: 4 rounds (for 3–4 players) or 4 rounds (for 2 players)  
  - Phases 2 and 3: 3 rounds (for 3–4 players) or 4 rounds (for 2 players)  
- In each round, players take turns clockwise.  
- On a turn, a player has 5 Action Points (AP) to spend.  
- After all rounds in a phase are complete, scoring occurs.  
- After scoring, the lowest-scoring player may move the king to any unoccupied space on any castle.  
- The player who moved the king starts the next phase.  

5. Core Mechanics  
**Action Points (AP)**: On your turn, spend 5 AP (unless modified) on any combination of the following actions:  

- **Add a Knight (2 AP)**:  
  - Place a knight from your supply on an empty space.  
  - The space must be orthogonally adjacent to one of your existing knights.  
  - The new knight must be placed at the same level or lower than the adjacent knight.  
  - Cannot be placed on a higher level.  

- **Move a Knight (1 AP per space)**:  
  - Move one knight orthogonally (not diagonally) one space.  
  - May move up only 1 level per space moved.  
  - May move down any number of levels.  
  - Cannot occupy a space with another knight or the king.  
  - **Castle Movement**: Knights may enter a castle through any door and exit from any other door of the same castle (costs 1 AP). During this movement, they may descend any number of levels but cannot ascend (unless modified by an action card).  

- **Place a Tower Block (1 AP per block)**:  
  - Use blocks from one of your stacks.  
  - You may place fewer blocks than in the stack; unused blocks may be redistributed to other stacks (max 3 blocks per stack). Extra blocks return to the supply.  
  - Cannot place more than 3 blocks per turn.  
  - Blocks may be added to:  
    - Expand surface area: place on level 0 adjacent to a castle (diagonal connection not allowed).  
    - Increase height: place on top of an existing block in a castle.  
  - **Height Rule**: A castle may never be taller than its surface area (e.g., surface area 4 → max height 4).  
  - Castles may not merge via expansion (must remain orthogonally separated).  

- **Acquire Action Card (1 AP per card)**:  
  - Draw 1 card from the Action deck.  
  - May acquire up to 2 cards per turn.  
  - Cards cannot be played in the same turn they are acquired.  

- **Play 1 Action Card (0 AP)**:  
  - Play at most one card per turn.  
  - Card is discarded after use.  
  - Cards may alter movement, placement, or AP total.  

- **Move Scoring Marker (1 AP per space)**:  
  - Advance your marker on the scoring track.  
  - If the target space is occupied, move to the next empty space.  

**Action Card Descriptions** (may be played once per turn):  
- **Jump knight 2 levels up**: Move one of your knights two levels up to an orthogonally adjacent empty space (e.g., level 1 → level 3).  
- **Place tower block under knight**: Add a block from your supply under one of your knights. Knight can be on any level (including level 0). May create a new castle if space is not orthogonally adjacent to another castle. Cannot violate height rule.  
- **Place tower block from general supply**: Add a block from the common supply (not your stacks) to a castle. Normal placement rules apply.  
- **Move knight through castle doors**: Move one knight into any door of a castle and exit from any other door to an empty space. Knight may climb/descend within the castle as desired, but must exit onto an empty space. Movement is orthogonal from door.  
- **Diagonal knight move**: Move one knight 1 space diagonally. May also move up 1 level or down any number of levels. Target space must be empty.  
- **6 Action Points**: Use 6 AP this turn instead of 5.  
- **7 Action Points**: Use 7 AP this turn instead of 5.  
- **Move empty tower block**: Move any unoccupied tower block (not part of a castle with a knight) to another empty space. Cannot split a castle. If a single-block castle is moved, it may be removed (but total castles must remain ≥6). Cannot reduce surface area if it would violate height rule. May create a new castle if placed on non-adjacent empty space.  
- **Relocate knight**: Move one of your knights from any space to another empty space as if adding a new knight (must be orthogonally adjacent to one of your other knights and at same or lower level).  
- **Knight jump**: Move one knight orthogonally past another knight (friend or foe), landing on the next empty space beyond. May move up 1 level or down any number of levels. The jumped knight may be on any level.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Scoring (after each phase)**:  
- Players score in clockwise order starting with the starting player.  
- For each castle where you have at least one knight:  
  - Score = (surface area of castle) × (level of your highest knight in that castle)  
  - Only one knight per player per castle is scored.  
- **King’s Bonus**:  
  - After castle scoring, players with a knight in the king’s castle:  
    - Phase 1: +5 if knight on level 1  
    - Phase 2: +10 if knight on level 2  
    - Phase 3: +15 if knight on level 3  
  - Only one bonus per player, even with multiple knights on correct level.  
- **Scoring Marker Placement**:  
  - Advance marker by total points.  
  - If space is occupied, move to next empty space (no ties).  

**After Scoring**:  
- Lowest-scoring player may move the king to any unoccupied space (on any level, any castle).  
- That player starts the next phase.  

**Game End**:  
- Game ends after scoring in Phase 3.  
- Player with highest score wins.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a knight on level 0?** Yes, as long as it's orthogonally adjacent to one of your knights and at same or lower level.  
- **Can I connect castles diagonally?** Yes, but not orthogonally.  
- **Can I exceed 3 blocks in a stack in my supply?** No. Max 3 per stack.  
- **Can I use action cards to move the king?** No. Only the lowest-scoring player moves the king after scoring.  
- **Can I score a castle with no knights?** No. You must have at least one knight.  
- **Can I place a block to make a castle taller than its surface area?** No. Height ≤ surface area.  
- **Can I use “Place from general supply” to create a new castle?** No. Must be added to an existing castle.  
- **Can I move a tower block to create a new castle?** Yes, via “Move empty tower block” action, if placed on non-orthogonally-adjacent empty space.
