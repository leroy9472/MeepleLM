## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players are merchants vying for influence in a kingdom divided into three regions: Coast, Hills, and Mountains. By strategically placing merchants in cities, acquiring business permits, and leveraging political influence, players earn victory points (VPs). The goal is to score the most VPs through city expansion, noble status, and regional dominance.

2. Components  
- 3 Region boards (Coast, Hills, Mountains)  
- 1 Track board (for Coins and Nobility tracks)  
- 14 City Tokens  
- 45 Business Permit Tiles (15 per region)  
- 24 Councillors (in 6 colors)  
- 90 Politics Cards (13 per councillor color + 12 Jokers)  
- 1 Queen/King miniature  
- 5 Queen’s/King’s Reward Tiles (numbered 1st to 5th)  
- 7 Bonus Tiles:  
  - 3 Region Reward Tiles (Coast, Hills, Mountains)  
  - 4 General Reward Tiles (Gold, Silver, Bronze, Iron cities)  
- 40 Merchants/Emporiums (10 per player color)  
- 12 Marker Discs (3 per player color)  
- 30 Servants/Assistants (21 single, 9 triple)  
- 4 Player Overview Cards  
- 4 Council Balconies

3. Setup  
- Choose a side of the main board and place it adjacent to the track board.  
- Shuffle the 14 City Tokens and place one face-up on each corresponding city space. The grey/purple city (Juvelar/Graden) receives no token; place the Queen here instead.  
- Divide Business Permit Tiles into three region stacks (Coast, Hills, Mountains). Shuffle each stack and place face-down on the board. Reveal 2 tiles per region face-up.  
- Place the 3 Region Reward Tiles on their designated spaces in each region. Place the 4 General Reward Tiles on the center of the track board.  
- Stack the 5 Queen’s Reward Tiles face-up on the track board in order: 1st (25 VP) on top, down to 5th (3 VP) on bottom.  
- Assemble the 4 Council Balconies and insert 4 random Councillors into each (3 region balconies and 1 Queen balcony). Place remaining 8 Councillors near the board.  
- Shuffle Politics Cards and place the deck beside the board. Place Servants in a shared pool.  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 10 small Merchants (place 1 on "0" of VP track)  
  - 3 marker discs (1 on "0" of Nobility track, 1 on starting coin space)  
  - 1 big Merchant (color reference)  
  - 1 Player Overview Card  
- Starting player places marker on "10" of coin track and receives 1 Servant; next players receive +1 coin and +1 Servant each (11/2, 12/3, 13/4).  
- Each player draws 6 Politics Cards.  
- For 2-player game: draw 1 random Business Permit Tile per region, place neutral Merchants in all cities shown, then shuffle tiles back.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise.  
- Each turn has two phases:  
  1. Draw a Politics Card (reshuffle discard if deck is empty).  
  2. Perform one Main Action and optionally one Quick Action (in any order).  
- A player triggers the endgame upon placing their 10th Merchant.

5. Core Mechanics

  - Take an available Councillor and insert into any Council Balcony from the arrowed side, pushing the last Councillor off.  
  - Gain 4 coins.  
- Acquire a Business Permit Tile:  
  - Discard 1–4 Politics Cards matching Councillor colors in a region’s balcony (1:1 match; no duplicates unless multiple same-color Councillors).  
  - Joker cards act as wilds but cost 1 coin each.  
  - Pay coins based on cards played:  
    - 1 card = 10 coins  
    - 2 cards = 7 coins  
    - 3 cards = 4 coins  
    - 4 cards = 0 coins  
  - Choose one of the two face-up tiles for that region, take it (face-up), and gain its immediate bonuses.  
  - Replace with top tile from stack.  
- Place a Merchant Using a Permit Tile:  
  - Use a face-up Business Permit Tile to place a Merchant in a city shown on the tile.  
  - Flip the tile face-down.

- Change Business Permit Tiles: Pay 1 Servant to return both face-up tiles in a region to the bottom of the stack and reveal two new ones.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can you place a Merchant in a city using a permit even if you can’t afford Servants?  
  No. Servants must be paid per opponent in the city. If you lack Servants, you cannot place.  
- Can you use a Business Permit Tile if you can’t place a Merchant?  
  Yes. You may acquire and use the tile’s immediate bonus even if you cannot place a Merchant.  
- Can you move the Queen without placing a Merchant?  
  No. Moving the Queen is part of the "Place a Merchant with Queen’s Help" action; placement is mandatory.  
- Can you use a Joker in a 4-card play to satisfy all Councillors and pay 0 coins?  
  Yes, but you must pay 1 coin per Joker used.  
- Do you trigger connected city bonuses when placing via the Queen?  
  Yes. Same rules apply as regular placement.  
- Can you gain Nobility Track bonuses from city tokens during final scoring?  
  No. Nobility Track bonuses are only gained when initially triggering them during the game.  
- Can you use the "Perform an Additional Main Action" Quick Action to do two Queen-assisted placements?  
  Yes, if you can pay the cost twice.
