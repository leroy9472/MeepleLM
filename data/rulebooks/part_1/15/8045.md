## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
*Princes of the Renaissance* is set in Italy between 1470–1500, a time of political intrigue, artistic flourishing, and mercenary warfare. Players take on the roles of powerful condottieri families vying for dominance through military might, political influence, and cultural patronage. The objective is to amass the most victory points (VPs) over three decades by controlling cities, winning wars, holding valuable tiles, and accumulating wealth and influence.

Victory is measured through:
- City status-based VPs
- War victories
- Gold and Influence rankings
- Pope and Event tile bonuses

There is no official tiebreaker in the original rules, though a 2016 edition suggests using combined Gold and Influence totals.

   - 40 Gold
   - 12 Influence
4. **Set City Status Track**:
   - Venice: 7
   - Milan, Florence: 6

5. **Place Wars Fought Marker**: On "0" space.
6. **Organize Tiles**:
   - Troop tiles: Sorted by type, face-up near board.
   - City tiles: Grouped by city color, face-up.
   - Event tiles: Separate into three decade piles; only Decade I face-up.
   - Pope tile: Placed near Event tiles.
   - Treachery tiles: Shuffled, placed face-down.
7. **Determine Starting Player for First Decade**: Randomly chosen.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **three decades**. Each decade consists of a variable number of rounds ending when the **last Event tile of that decade is auctioned**.

#### Turn Order
- Players act one at a time in clockwise order.
- In the first decade, turn order begins with the randomly chosen starting player.
- In subsequent decades, turn order continues from the last player who took an action.

#### Actions (Choose One Per Round)
1. **Buy a Tile**
2. **Auction a Tile**
3. **Start a War**
4. **Pass**

Players may negotiate freely at any time, but only **Gold and Influence** can be exchanged. All other deals are non-binding.

---

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action 1: Buy a Tile  
- **Troop Tile**: Pay face value in Gold.  
  - Cannot buy Cavalry or Artillery in the 1st decade.  
  - Only one of each troop type allowed per player.  
  - May instead **discard a Troop tile** (return to supply).  
- **Treachery Card**: Pay 1 Gold + 1 Influence.  
  - Max hand limit: 2 cards (can be increased via Family or City tiles).  
  - If over limit, must discard down to limit immediately.

#### Action 2: Auction a Tile  
The active player selects one tile to auction. Bidding proceeds clockwise; once a player passes, they may not re-enter.

- **City Tile**:
  - Bid in Gold.
  - Minimum bid: **2 × current city status**.
  - Active player must make the first bid.
  - Player limits: Max 6 City tiles, from max 3 different cities.
  - **Compensation Rule**: If the auctioning player starts but does **not win**, they may buy **one Treachery card** for 1 Gold + 1 Influence.

- **Event Tile**:
  - Bid in Gold or Influence (as indicated on tile).
  - Minimum bid: 0.
  - Active player may bid 0 or pass.
  - Effects:
    - **VP Tile**: Kept until game end; score VP.
    - **+1 Sta'**: Place on any city, increase its status by 1.
    - **Merchant**: Retain; each Merchant City tile you own earns +1 Gold per decade and +1 VP per tile at game end.
    - **French Invade**: Must be played immediately (reduce any city’s status by 2) or discarded.

- **Pope Tile**:
  - Bid in Influence.
  - Minimum bid: 0.
  - Holder gains:
    - +3 Gold income per decade.
    - May form a **Holy League** once per decade (add troops to a war).
    - 3 VP at game end.

#### Action 3: Start a War  
May only be taken if war limit not reached:
- **4 wars per decade** if <5 players
- **5 wars per decade** if 5–6 players

Steps:
1. Move **Wars Fought marker** forward by 1.
2. Declare **attacking** (black marker) and **defending** (white marker) cities.
3. **Veto Phase**: Any player with veto ability may cancel the war (marker still advances).
4. **Auction Condottieri**:
   - Only players with **at least one Troop tile** may bid.
   - Bid in Influence.
   - No minimum bid.
   - **Attacker first**, then Defender (winner of Attacker auction excluded).
   - If neither side has a condottiere: war is a **tie**, no effect.
   - If only one side has a condottiere: unrepresented city fights with **+3** modifier.
5. **Payment**: Each condottiere places Gold equal to their city’s current status on their Family tile (collected at decade end).
6. **Holy League**: Pope holder may join one side (once per decade), adding only troop strength (no modifiers), no payment, no VP reward.
7. **Bribe Troops Phase**: In order: Attacker → Defender → Pope (if in Holy League). Each may play one or more "Bribe Troops" cards to nullify an opponent’s troop.
8. **Combat**:
   - Roll 1d6 and add:
     - Troop attack/defence values
     - Relevant modifiers (City, Family, Treachery)
   - **Round 1 (Attack)**:
     - If Attacker > Defender: Attacker wins.
     - Else: proceed to Counter-Attack.
   - **Round 2 (Counter-Attack)**:
     - Roles reverse: original Defender attacks, original Attacker defends.
     - If Counter-Attacker wins: Defender wins war.
     - Else: **tie war**.
9. **War Outcome**:
   - Winner’s city: +1 or +2 status (if winning total ≥ 2× loser’s)
   - Loser’s city: −1 or −2 status
   - No city status may go above 10 or below 3.
   - **Victory Counter**: Awarded to winning condottiere (Pope does not get one).
   - Troops are **not lost**.

#### Action 4: Pass  
- Skip turn.
- May still participate in future rounds and auctions.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after income collection at the end of the **third decade**.

#### Final Scoring Steps:
1. **Rank Cities by Status**:
   - Place City Status tokens in VP spaces: 10, 7, 5, 3, 2.
   - **Tiebreaker**: City with more **Artist Event tiles** (e.g., Botticelli, Michelangelo) wins.
   - If still tied: all tied cities take the **lowest** of the contested VP values.

2. **Score Each Player**:
   - **City Tiles**: One VP per tile × city's final VP value (e.g., 3 Florence tiles in top city = 3 × 10 = 30 VP).
   - **Event Tiles**:
     - VP tiles: Score printed VP.
     - Merchant tiles: +1 VP per Merchant City tile owned.
   - **Pope Tile**: 3 VP if held at game end.
   - **Gold**:
     - Most Gold: **6 VP** (if tied, all tied get **5 VP**, no 2nd place score).
     - Second Most: **3 VP** (if tied, all tied get **2 VP**).
   - **Influence**:
     - Most Influence: **4 VP** (if tied, all tied get **3 VP**, no 2nd place score).
     - Second Most: **2 VP** (if tied, all tied get **1 VP**).
   - **Victory Counters** (from wars):
     - 1st counter: 1 VP
     - 2nd: 2 VP
     - 3rd: 3 VP
     - etc. (sum of 1+2+3+…+n)
     - Example: 4 counters = 1+2+3+4 = **10 VP**

**Total all VP sources. Highest score wins.**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I buy more than one tile per turn?**  
  No. Only one tile per Buy action.

- **What happens if I exceed Treachery card limit?**  
  You may buy over the limit, but must discard immediately to comply.

- **Can I discard a City tile?**  
  No. City tiles are permanent once acquired.

- **Can I use a City tile’s ability after the last Event tile is auctioned?**  
  No. Special actions (e.g., Banking, Lucrezia Borgia) must be used **before** the last Event tile auction of the decade.

- **Does a vetoed war count toward the decade limit?**  
  Yes. The Wars Fought marker advances regardless.

- **Can the Pope earn Gold or Victory counters?**  
  No. When joining via Holy League, the Pope contributes troops only.

- **Can I bid more than I have in resources?**  
  Yes, if you have discounts (e.g., Family or City tile reductions) that allow you to pay within your current holdings.

- **Is the French Invade tile counted as an Artist tile for tiebreakers?**  
  According to BGG clarifications by rule reviser, **yes** — it should be counted when resolving city status ties.

- **Can I use a Treachery card during an auction I’m not in?**  
  Yes, as long as it's your turn to bid (e.g., Freeze Bid can target any player).

- **Do troop modifiers apply if the troop is bribed?**  
  No. A "Bribed" troop contributes **nothing** to attack/defence, and any city ability relying on that troop is negated.
