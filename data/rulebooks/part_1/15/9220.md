## Saboteur — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the roles of dwarven miners and saboteurs in a hidden-identity card game. Miners aim to build a tunnel from the mine entrance to a hidden gold treasure, while saboteurs secretly hinder progress. After 3 rounds, the player with the most gold nuggets wins.

2. Components  
- 44 Path Cards (including 1 Start card and 3 Goal cards: 1 with gold, 2 with stone)  
- 27 Action Cards:  
  - Broken Tools (Pickaxe, Lantern, Mine Cart)  
  - Fix Tools (matching repairs; some repair two types)  
  - Rockfall (removes a path card)  
  - Map (peek at one goal card)  
- 28 Gold Nugget Cards (in various denominations: 1, 2, 3 nuggets)  
- 11 Role Cards:  
  - 7 Gold Miners  
  - 4 Saboteurs  

3. Setup  
- Determine roles based on player count:  
  - 3 players: 1 Saboteur, 3 Miners  
  - 4 players: 1 Saboteur, 4 Miners  
  - 5 players: 2 Saboteurs, 4 Miners  
  - 6 players: 2 Saboteurs, 5 Miners  
  - 7 players: 3 Saboteurs, 5 Miners  
  - 8 players: 3 Saboteurs, 6 Miners  
  - 9 players: 3 Saboteurs, 7 Miners  
  - 10 players: All 11 role cards used  

- Shuffle the required role cards, deal 1 face down to each player. Set aside the extra role card (face down).  
- Place the Start card face up. Shuffle the 3 Goal cards and place them face down in a row, spaced vertically, with ~7 card spaces between Start and middle Goal.  
- Combine remaining 40 Path Cards and 27 Action Cards into a single draw deck. Shuffle.  
- Deal starting hands:  
  - 3–5 players: 6 cards each  
  - 6–7 players: 5 cards each  
  - 8–10 players: 4 cards each  
- Place draw deck near the goals. Shuffle Gold Nugget Cards into a separate face-down pile.  
- Youngest player goes first. Play proceeds clockwise.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn:  
1. Play one card:  
   a. **Play a Path Card**: Place adjacent to an existing card, connecting paths continuously. Must maintain connection to Start card. Rotate as needed.  
   b. **Play an Action Card**:  
      - *Broken Tool*: Play in front of any player (including self). Prevents them from playing Path Cards. Max one of each type per player.  
      - *Fix Tool*: Remove a matching Broken Tool from any player. Discard both cards.  
      - *Rockfall*: Play in front of self. Remove any Path Card (except Start or Goal) from the maze. Discard both cards.  
      - *Map*: Secretly view one Goal card. Return it face down. Discard Map card.  
   c. **Pass**: Discard one card face down to the discard pile.  
2. Draw one card from the draw deck (if available).  
When the draw deck is empty, players no longer draw after playing.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Path Building**:  
  - Cards must connect edge-to-edge (short to short, long to long).  
  - All paths must align continuously with adjacent cards.  
  - New cards must connect directly to the existing network and maintain an uninterrupted path back to the Start.  
  - Goal cards are an exception: they may be placed even if not all paths align.  

- **Action Cards**:  
  - Only one Broken Tool of each type (Pickaxe, Lantern, Cart) may be active on a player at once.  
  - Fix Tools must match the broken tool type. Dual-tool Fix Cards can repair either one.  
  - Rockfall can clear dead ends or sabotage progress.  
  - Map allows strategic intelligence; players may lie about findings.  

- **Passing**:  
  - Required if unable or unwilling to play.  
  - Discard one card face down.  
  - Players with empty hands must pass without discarding.

6. Scoring & End Game  
A round ends when:  
- A player completes a path from Start to the **gold** Goal card → Miners win.  
- The draw deck is exhausted and all players pass consecutively → Saboteurs win.  

**Miners Win**:  
- The player who completed the path draws a number of Gold Nugget Cards equal to the number of Miners.  
- Starting with that player, each Miner (in clockwise order) takes one card from the pile until all are distributed.  
- Saboteurs receive nothing.  
- *Optional Rule*: Miners with active Broken Tools at round end do not receive gold.  

**Saboteurs Win**:  
- Reveal all role cards.  
- If no Saboteurs were in play (possible in 3–4 player games), no one gets gold.  
- Otherwise:  
  - 1 Saboteur: receives 4 nuggets total (in any card combination)  
  - 2 or 3 Saboteurs: each receives 3 nuggets  
  - 4 Saboteurs: each receives 2 nuggets  

**Next Round**:  
- Reuse same role cards (shuffle including the set-aside one).  
- Reset path, action, and goal cards.  
- Reshuffle and redealt hands.  
- Gold Nugget Cards are reshuffled.  
- Starting player: the player to the left of the one who played the last card in the previous round.

**End of Game**:  
- After 3 rounds, all players reveal and total their Gold Nugget Cards.  
- Highest total wins.  
- Tie: players share victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a path card be played that doesn’t lead to gold?**  
  Yes—Miners may explore multiple routes; Saboteurs may mislead.  
- **Can you play a Fix Tool on yourself?**  
  Yes.  
- **Can you play a Rockfall on a card that breaks multiple paths?**  
  Yes, if it’s part of the maze (not Start or Goal).  
- **What if a Goal card can’t align with adjacent paths?**  
  It’s legal—place it as best as possible. Only Goal cards have this exception.  
- **Can a player with a Broken Tool play Action or Pass?**  
  Yes—only Path Card play is blocked.  
- **What if the draw deck runs out but someone can still play?**  
  Game continues. Players draw only if deck has cards.  
- **Are Gold Nugget Cards kept secret?**  
  Yes—until final scoring.
