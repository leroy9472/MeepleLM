### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn has two phases:  

#### A. Move the Car  
- Move the shared car clockwise along the 10-star street.  
- First space is free; each additional space costs 1 peso.  
- Stop at a Cuban tile or the Port.  

**If stopping at a Cuban:**  
- Use the Cuban’s ability.  
- Then move your player piece to a building matching the flower color on the Cuban tile.  
- You may use the building’s ability (optional).  

**If stopping at the Port:**  
- Trigger a Delivery Round (see below).  
- You **cannot** use a building this turn.  

#### B. Use a Building (after visiting a Cuban)  
- Move your player piece to a building under a flower of the same color as the Cuban visited.  
- Cannot move to an occupied building unless:  
  - All 3 buildings of that color are occupied → may reuse your current building.  
  - You visited El Zorro → may reuse your current building.  
- Using the building is optional.  
- If your piece ends on another player’s building, that player gains 1 VP.
