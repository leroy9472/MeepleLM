## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
With the Chronicle Expansion, players combine Episodes 1 and 2 of *Perseverance: Castaway Chronicles* into a four-game campaign. The campaign alternates between Episode 1 (games 1 and 2) and Episode 2 (games 3 and 4). The goal is to earn the most Glory across the campaign by achieving status in the community through Achievements, influencing the society's development, and succeeding in each game. In multiplayer, the player with the most Glory wins. In solo, the player must exceed the Dissenters' total Opposition.

### 2. Components
- Campaign Log (paper pad)
- 32 Chronicle tokens (8 per player)
- 9 Chronicle Expansion player aids
- 8 Achievement tiles
- 50 Chronicle cards

### 3. Setup
**1. Campaign Preparations:**
- Each player receives a Campaign Log sheet to track Glory.
- Mark the campaign difficulty (Easy, Medium, or Hard) on the log.

**2. Main Play Area Setup:**
- **Game 1 (Episode 1):** Use side "A" of Episode 1 player boards.
- **Game 2 (Episode 1):** Use side "B" of Episode 1 player boards.
- **Game 3 (Episode 2):** Do not place the Temple; use the non-Temple side of relevant map tiles. Use "A" side of other map tiles.
- **Game 4 (Episode 2):** Use "B" side of all map tiles and place the Temple as usual.
- Dissenters' difficulty can be set independently of the campaign difficulty.

**3. Prepare Achievement Tiles Deck:**
- At the start of games 1 and 2: Remove all Achievement tiles showing only the Episode 2 icon.
- At the start of games 2 and later: Deal carried-over Achievement tiles (from previous game) to players as recorded on their Campaign Log.

**4. Prepare Chronicle Cards Deck:**
- At the start of games 1 and 2: Remove all Chronicle cards showing only the Episode 2 icon.
- At the start of games 3 and 4: Remove any Chronicle card showing only the Episode 1 icon.
- At the start of games 2 and later: Deal carried-over Chronicle cards (from previous game) to players as recorded on their Campaign Log.

**5. Player Setup:**
- Each player receives 8 Chronicle tokens.
- In 1- or 2-player games: Place 4 Dissenter Chronicle tokens nearby (use one Dissenter color if solo).

**6. Create Achievement Display:**
- At the start of games 2 and later: Collect carried-over Achievement tiles from players, shuffle them, and place them at the bottom of the Achievement tiles deck.
- Reveal Achievement tiles to form the display: 3 for 1 player, 4 for 2–3 players, 5 for 4 players.

**7. Create Chronicle Cards Offer:**
- From the Chronicle deck, set aside any card whose icons do not match any icon currently visible on the Achievement tiles in the display.
- Shuffle the remaining deck and split it into four roughly even piles. Place them face down next to the Achievement Display with their icons visible. Leave room for a discard pile.

**8. Marking Achievements:**
- In ascending order of total Glory, each player chooses an unmarked Achievement tile and places one of their Chronicle tokens under it to mark it.
- If tied in Glory (including first game), start with the first player in turn order and proceed clockwise.
- Dissenters do not mark Achievements in 1- or 2-player games.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- On a player's turn: Resolve Primary Action, Secondary Action, and then End-of-Turn Checks.
- End-of-Turn Checks:
  - **Episode 1:** Check for Dino Attack (if all Dino spaces are full), then Claim Achievements, then check for Assembly (if no dice in pool).
  - **Episode 2:** Reset toppled Soldiers/Leader, resolve ongoing Breach, Claim Achievements, then check for Assembly (if no dice in pool).
- Claiming Achievements occurs during End-of-Turn Checks, before an Assembly if triggered.
- In turn order, players may claim Achievements during any player's turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Glory:** Represents success as a leader. Gained permanently and tracked on the Campaign Log.

**Achievements:** Represent status in the community. There are 8 types:
- Defender, Hunter, Scout, Homesteader, Orator, Commander, Mentor, Builder

**Claiming Achievements:**
- Can claim if condition was met during the turn.
- Multiple Achievements can be claimed per turn, or the same Achievement twice.
- To claim the same Achievement twice on one turn, the condition must be met in two different steps:
  - Resolve Primary Action
  - Resolve Secondary Action
  - Resolve Dino Attack (Episode 1)
  - Resolve Patrol/Adventure Stage
- If multiple players want to claim, start with the current player and proceed clockwise.

**Claiming Procedure:**
- If not already marked: Mark the Achievement and gain 1 Glory.
- If already marked: Choose to either gain a reward and unmark it, or leave it marked.
  - **Gain a Reward:**
    - **If a matching Chronicle card is available:** Draw the top card from each of the four Chronicle decks showing at least one matching icon. Choose one to keep, discard the rest. Gain the Glory on the card. Tuck the card under your player board (top half visible). If you have 4 cards, discard one. Place Chronicle tokens on its spaces. All players (including you) unmark the Achievement.
    - **If no matching Chronicle card is available:** Gain 2 Glory and either 1 Zone's Production or 1 Officer Bonus of your choice. Discard the top card of all four Chronicle decks. All players (including you) unmark the Achievement.
  - **Leave Marked:** Do nothing. All other players must still unmark it.

**Chronicle Actions and Modifiers:**
- Chronicle tokens on a card indicate how many times the ability can be used.
- Return a token to your supply when using the ability.
- Limited to one Chronicle Action or Modifier per turn (Permanent abilities do not count).
- **Chronicle Actions:** Can be used:
  - Before Primary Action
  - Before Secondary Action (after Primary)
  - After Secondary Action (before Patrol/Adventure resolution)
- **Modifiers:** Used as specified (e.g., before a Primary Action to avoid a Dino Attack).

### 6. Scoring & End Game

  - 1 Glory (1–10 more)

  - 3 Glory (31+ more)

**Final Glory Scoring (After Game 4):**
- **2-4 Players:** Player with most total Glory wins. If tied, most Governorships wins. If still tied, players share the victory.
- **1 Player:** Mark 1 Opposition for each Dissenter Chronicle token still on an Achievement. Total Glory vs. Total Opposition (including pre-printed 10). If Glory > Opposition, you win. Otherwise, you lose.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Chronicle Tokens:** Intended to be unlimited. Use proxies if needed.
- **Chronicle Card Decks:** When a deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile, halve it, place one half to recreate the deck, and discard the other half.
- **Achievement Carry-Over:** An Achievement can only be carried over by one player.
- **Chronicle Card Carry-Over:** Players carry over all Chronicle cards from their player board, even if they show only Episode 1 icons in Episode 2 games.
- **Dissenters in Solo Play:** The Dissenters act as one entity. They claim Achievements on their turn using a specific procedure involving their Action card and the icons on its bottom.
