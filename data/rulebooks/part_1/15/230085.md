### 3. Setup

2. Choose a main and secondary player color. Take all main color components and all workers and II markers of the secondary color. Return the rest to the box.  
3. Prepare one player board using main color markers (for resources, offerings, favors). Set aside secondary color markers.  
4. Place all 20 workers in a row on the Solo Track, starting with the main color and alternating.  
5. Set up the Imperial Board with Influence Markers of your main color (do not use secondary color).  
6. Set up Guild Influence Tracks with 6 markers of your secondary color (2 per guild). Place remaining 5 markers next to the Imperial Board for later use. Do not use the Akbar section.  
7. Remove the Sadr us-Sudur (No. 20, level-III) Notable card. Place along the River:  
   - 3 level-I Notables  
   - 3 level-II Notables  
   - 2 level-III Notables  
   - 1 level-IV Notable  
8. Ensure 3 Notables from each Guild are present; replace as needed.  
9. Start with 2 Rupees.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of three phases:

#### Meditation Phase
- Turn the topmost worker on the Solo Track 90° to indicate the active color.
- Lay down any number of workers of the active color to generate Meditation Points (MPs) based on your Meditation tracker.
- Spend MPs on Meditation actions (e.g., deliver goods, process goods, move farmers, remove cover tiles, exchange goods).
- Move the Meditation marker to the last used action (except “Move a Farmer,” which is always available).

#### Action Phase
- Take the topmost worker from the Solo Track.
- Place it on an action space or reactivate a worker using the Peon action.
- If using Peon: return a removed Cover Tile (unless using a Favour Tile), pay 1 Rupee, and reactivate a worker of the active color. The active color remains for the next turn.
- If kicking out a worker, place it on the first empty space beneath the last worker on the Solo Track. Only workers of a different color can kick out.
- Resolve Solo Track effect associated with the worker’s placement spot:
  - **Favor**: Gain 1 Favour.
  - **Builder**: Build the building where the Builder is, then move the Builder by rolling the die.
  - **Notables**: Remove a Notable based on die roll (counting from top of River, wrapping if needed). The Contract is considered fulfilled; any markers on it become Favour.
  - **Demands**: Fulfill the current Guild Demand based on die roll (1–2 Artisans, 3–4 Merchants, 5–6 Scholars). Place a secondary color marker; move the Demand marker. If limit reached, do not place a marker.
- Effects on spaces 1–20 trigger before removing the worker; effects after space 20 trigger at the end of the turn (rotate worker 90° to remember).

#### Order Phase (Optional)
Choose one:
- **Serve Emperor Akbar**: Deliver exactly one undelivered good to Akbar.
- **Fulfill a Guild Order**: Deliver both goods of a marked order. Your Influence must be at least one step up. Gain Rupees based on your rank; if not first, move up one step.

Secondary Actions (may be performed anytime):
- **Oil and Curry**: Pay 1 Oil or 1 Curry to stand one worker; or 1 Oil and 1 Curry to stand three.
- **Favour Actions**: Spend Favour to perform actions from Favour tiles (each once per turn).
- **Luxury Goods**: Spend one of each (Statue, Paintings, Books, Clothes) for special effects.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Solo Track**: Drives solo gameplay. Workers are placed and removed in order. Effects trigger based on position.
- **Active Color**: Determined by the top worker on the Solo Track (rotated at start of turn). Only this color can be used for Meditation and Peon actions.
- **Peon Action**: Reactivate a worker of the active color by paying 1 Rupee and returning a Cover Tile (unless using a Favour Tile). No new worker is taken.
- **Kicking Out**: Only workers of a different color can displace each other. No Favour is earned for kicked-out workers.
- **Meditation Points**: Generated by laying down workers of the active color. Used immediately.
- **Building**: When using Architect, pay materials. Using ≥2 types gives +1 value. Take one Building Bonus tile and remove another of the same level. No worker is placed (solo rule).
- **Statue Action**: Move one worker of the active color to another space (do not take a new worker).
- **Favor Generation**: From kicking out standing workers (1 or 2), visiting Merchant (2), Guild track bonuses, following processing, Notables, and River events.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### End Game Conditions (any one):
1. All buildings are built (all Under Construction tiles removed).  
2. A worker is placed on space 36 of the Solo Track.  
3. A level-IV Notable’s Contract is fulfilled.  
4. Your Influence marker reaches the top of an Influence track.  
5. A Guild Order column is filled with 6 player markers.  
→ Game ends at the end of that turn (no extra round).

#### Final Scoring:
- **Fulfilled Game End Notables**: Receive Rupees as specified on the Contract.
- **Meditation Track**: If your tracker is on the last space, gain 5 Rupees.
- **Cover Tiles**: 1 Rupee per removed tile (excluding those removed via Peon action).
- **Total Rupees**: Highest total wins. Tiebreaker: value of remaining goods and Favour (1 each). If still tied, share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Peon Action Limit**: Standard allows 8 uses (20 workers, alternating colors). Hard variant limits to 4; Easy variant removes restriction.
- **Peon Cost**: Standard is 1 Cover Tile + 1 Rupee. Hard variant increases to 2 Cover Tiles + 1 Rupee.
- **Meditation in Easy Mode**: Can use both colors to generate MPs.
- **Peon Reactivation in Easy Mode**: Can reactivate any color, not just active.
- **Favor from Kicked-Out Workers**: Never earned in solo, regardless of position.
- **Builder Movement**: Always roll die unless specified otherwise. Die result stays until next roll.
- **Notable Removal via Solo Track**: Counts as fulfilled for Boat movement and Favour distribution.
- **Architect Bonus**: Only 6 bonuses available (2 per level). After that, no bonus for building.
- **Statue Action**: Does not count as a full turn; only an additional action phase.
