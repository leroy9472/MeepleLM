# Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Manoeuvre is a Napoleonic-era wargame inspired by chess, simulating tactical warfare with cards and unit movement. The game emphasizes ease of play and variability across matches. Victory is achieved either by eliminating five enemy units (Attrition Victory) or by controlling more squares on the opponent's side of the battlefield when the day ends (Nightfall Victory).

### 2. Components
- 8 map squares (4×4 grid each)
- 2 six-sided dice (d6), 2 eight-sided dice (d8), 2 ten-sided dice (d10)
- 1 counter sheet (8 unit counters per army, double-sided: full and reduced strength)
- 4 decks of 60 playing cards (one per nation)
- 2 Reference Cards
- Advance to Contact tokens (1, 2, 3)
- Redoubt markers (implied; no fixed number)

### 3. Setup
1. Both players roll a d10; the higher roller is First Player (P1). Re-roll ties.
2. P1 selects and arranges 4 map sections into a 2×2 grid (8×8 battlefield).
3. P2 selects two nations to be used.
4. P1 chooses one of the two nations; P2 takes the other.
5. P2 selects their starting edge (one of the four map edges); P1 gets the opposite edge.
6. Each player shuffles their Action Deck; opponent may cut it.
7. Each player draws 5 cards.
   - *Optional (Experienced/Tournament Play):* Players may select their starting 5 cards before shuffling.
8. P1 places all 8 units at full strength in the two rows closest to their starting edge (1 unit per square).
9. P2 does the same.
10. P1 begins the first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game turn consists of two player turns (P1, then P2). Each player turn has five phases:

1. **Discard Phase**: Discard any number of cards from hand.
2. **Draw Phase**: Draw cards to restore hand to 5 cards.
   - If a deck is exhausted, reshuffle the discard pile (except on the final pass—see End Game).
3. **Movement Phase**: Must move exactly 1 unit:
   - Infantry: 1 square.
   - Cavalry: 1 or 2 squares (cannot backtrack unless using Forced March).
   - No diagonal movement.
   - Cannot enter occupied squares or leave the map.
   - Advance to Contact: First turn—move 3 units; second turn—move 2 units; from third turn on—1 unit.
   - HQ Cards: Supply (move extra unit), Forced March (move +1 square), Banzai Charge (replace movement).
   - Guerrilla card can negate Supply or Forced March.
4. **Combat Phase**: May declare exactly one combat of the following types:
   - **Assault**: Attack adjacent enemy. Attacker plays matching Unit Card with Attack value. Cannot initiate from Marsh.
   - **Ambush**: Play Ambush HQ card; target any enemy unit.
   - **Volley**: Attack adjacent enemy with matching Unit Card (Volley value).
   - **Bombardment**: Attack up to 2 squares away (orthogonal path; no Hills, Towns, Woods, or units in between).
   - **Rockets**: Japanese-specific; range 2–3 from hill to non-hill; roll d10: 5–8 = retreat, 9–10 = retreat + hit.
5. **Restoration Phase**: May attempt to restore one reduced-strength unit:
   - Play Supply or Regroup card: automatic success (may be negated by Guerrilla).
   - Play matching Unit Card: automatic success (may be negated by Guerrilla).
   - Play Leader Card: roll d6; success if within Rally range.
   - After restoration, may play one Redoubt card under a unit.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Combat Resolution**:
  - **Assault/Ambush**:
    - Defender may Withdraw (using Withdraw card or US unit card with Withdraw value).
    - If not, both sides play cards.
    - Attack Total = Unit strength(s) + die rolls + Leader Combat value + terrain + redoubt.
    - Defense Total = Unit strength + card defense + Leader Combat + terrain + redoubt.
    - Compare totals using Assault/Ambush Results Table:
      - < Defense: All attacking/supporting units take a Hit.
      - = Defense: No effect.
      - > Defense: Defender chooses Hit or Retreat.
      - ≥ 2× Defense: Attacker chooses Hit or Retreat.
      - ≥ 3× Defense: Hit and Retreat.
      - ≥ 4× Defense: Elimination.
  - **Volley/Bombardment**:
    - Attack Total = die roll + terrain.
    - Defense Total = unit strength + terrain.
    - If Attack > Defense: Defender takes a Hit.
- **Supporting Units**: If a Leader with Command ≥ 2 is played, up to (Command – 1) adjacent units may support. They add strength and card die rolls. If attack fails, all supporting units take a Hit.
- **Advance After Combat**: If defender vacates square (Retreat, Withdraw, Elimination) in Assault, an attacking/supporting unit must Advance into it, unless all involved units played cards with "Not required to advance".
- **Pursuit**: If cavalry Advances after Retreat/Withdraw and played a card with Pursuit value, roll d6 per card. If roll (modified by Leader Pursuit value) is within Pursuit range, defender takes a Hit. Two Hits eliminate a full-strength unit.
- **Leaders**: May use only one of: Combat, Command, Rally, or Pursuit value per use.
- **Redoubt**: Play Redoubt card during Restoration Phase. Adds +3 Defense. Removed when unit leaves.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Attrition Victory**: Eliminate 5+ enemy units → win immediately.
  - Exception: If you lose your 5th or more unit in the same battle due to Committed Attack, you lose.
- **Nightfall Victory**: Game ends at the end of the turn when both players have drawn their last card from their initial deck (i.e., both have reshuffled at least once).
  - Score: 1 VP per enemy-half square controlled.
    - Controlled = occupied OR orthogonally adjacent with no enemy unit in or adjacent to that square.
    - Includes impassable squares (e.g., Lake).
  - Winner: Higher VP total.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Most enemy units eliminated.
  2. Fewest of own units at reduced strength.
  3. Army ranking (France wins last):  
     1. France, 2. GB, 3. Russia, 4. Prussia, 5. Austria, 6. Spain, 7. Ottoman, 8. US

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a unit not move?** Yes, but must discard entire hand before Movement Phase ends ("Digging In").
- **Can multiple Supply or Forced March cards be played?** Only one Supply per turn; only one Forced March per unit per turn.
- **Can Guerrilla negate any card?** Only: Supply, Forced March, Regroup, matching Unit Card in Restoration, or a subsequent Unit Card in combat (not the initiating one).
- **Can a unit retreat if all adjacent squares are blocked?** No → unit is eliminated.
- **Can a Leader be used for both Combat and Rally?** No → only one function per play.
- **Can a unit in Marsh initiate Bombardment or Volley?** Yes.
- **Can Ambush use Skirmish?** No.
