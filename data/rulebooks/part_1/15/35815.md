# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The hero must defeat the Villain in a showdown before the Shadow Track moves off the end. The game simulates a supernatural investigation where time is against the hero. The Villain grows stronger as time passes via the co-operative side of the Shadow Track.

## 2. Components
- Game board (Shadowbrook and optional expansions)
- Hero character sheet (one only)
- Villain and Minion tokens
- Shadow Track and marker
- Secrets deck
- Event, Mystery, and Location cards
- Investigation tokens
- Action point tracking (implied)
- Standard ATOE components as in base and Something Wicked expansions

## 3. Setup
- Use the co-operative side of the Villain shadow track.
- Use only one Hero character.
- Prepare secrets deck:
  - Split into 'evil' and non-evil piles.
  - Randomly select 2 evil secrets and 4 non-evil secrets.
  - Shuffle these 6 together and assign one to each of the 6 town elders.
  - Shuffle remaining secrets into a separate deck.
- Set Villain wound marker according to standard rules.
- Place Hero at starting location (e.g., Town Hall).

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of:
1. **Hero Phase (Day)** – Hero spends 12 action points (adjustable difficulty).
2. **Villain Phase (Night)** – Villain heals, draws Mystery card, and rolls on Villain Action chart.

Repeat until win or loss condition is met.
