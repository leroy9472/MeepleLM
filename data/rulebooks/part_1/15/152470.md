### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Fief: France 1429*, players lead noble families competing for power, wealth, and influence in medieval France. Victory is achieved by accumulating Victory Points (VPs) through control of Fiefs, election to Royal or Ecclesiastical titles, and strategic alliances. The game ends at the conclusion of a round when a player or alliance meets the victory conditions.

- A **solo player wins** with **3 VPs**.
- An **alliance of two players wins** with **4 VPs** (or **5 VPs** if playing with the Crusades expansion).
- Alliances are formed via marriage and are only valid in 4–6 player games. In 3-player games, only solo victory is possible.

  - **Fortune Cards**: played during Phase 2; some are Opportunity cards (play anytime).
  - **Lord Cards**: played to add new Lords; D’Arc and Cardinal are Opportunity cards.
- **Elections**:
  - **Bishop**: Unmarried male Lord; votes based on village control and prior ecclesiastical titles.
  - **Pope**: Elected by Cardinals; requires absolute majority.
  - **King**: Titled Lord (non-ecclesiastical); requires simple majority, minimum 3 votes, and support from either 2 Bishops, 1 Cardinal, or Pope.
- **Siege**:
  - After battle, place 1-die Siege Engine to begin siege.
  - Flip to 2-die side if continuing next round.
  - Siege Engines cancel attacker penalties.
- **Captives**:
  - Taken when all troops killed but Lord survives.
  - Ransom: 2 + 2 per title; mandatory if affordable.
  - Escape via Secret Passage.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Scoring**:
  - Fief Title: 1 VP
  - King: 1 VP
  - Pope: 1 VP
- **End Game**:
  - Check after Phase 8.
  - **Solo Victory**: 3 VPs.
  - **Alliance Victory**: 4 VPs (5 with Crusades).
  - **Tiebreakers**: King > Pope > Queen Regent > most Fiefs > most Bishoprics > most Villages.
  - Solo victory beats alliance even with fewer VPs.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you attack your ally?** Yes, but alliance remains until marriage ends (death or papal annulment).
- **Can a Lord have multiple Bishop titles?** No. Max one Bishop or Cardinal title.
- **Does D’Arc count as a title for ransom?** No. D’Arc is not a title; ransom based only on formal titles.
- **Can you play Opportunity cards during Draw phase?** No. Cannot play during Draw, but may play instead of discarding.
- **What if a taxing Lord dies?** If Fief title remains in family, income goes to family; if title lost, no income. For Bishop/Cardinal/Pope, no Tithe collected if dead.
- **Can a Cavalcade be used from a besieged city?** Yes, must fight besieger immediately; if win, must move on.
- **Can multiple Uprisings be played on one village?** Yes; total damage = sum of all Battle Dice +1f each.
- **Can Secret Passage cancel Attacker Penalty in pre-battle (archers)?** No; only during main battle.
- **Can Holy Relics be transferred?** Yes, to any Lord in same village using Diplomacy marker.
