## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 1347, the Black Plague reaches Europe. Players represent factions trying to save as many of their people as possible from the spreading disease. The goal is to have the most surviving cubes (people) on the board when the game ends.

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board depicting 12 European regions and a palace area  
- 80 wooden cubes (20 per player in 4 colors)  
- 49 rat tokens (12 starting rats marked with purple borders, rest as supply)  
- 6 class cards (Peasant, Merchant, Monk, Witch, King, Knight)  
- 1 Plague piece (Grim Reaper)  
- (Optional expansions include additional cards, wall pieces, bishop/nun tokens, goods, etc., but base game uses above)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board in the center.  
2. Place one starting rat token (face down) in each region that is in play:  
   - 2 players: use only 8 light-colored regions  
   - 3 players: use 8 light + 2 medium-colored regions (10 total)  
   - 4 players: use all 12 regions  
3. Shuffle remaining starting rats with regular rat tokens to form a face-down supply. Remove excess tokens:  
   - 2 players: remove 12 random regular rat tokens  
   - 3 players: remove 6  
   - 4 players: use all  
4. Place the Plague piece in a randomly chosen region.  
5. Each player chooses a color and takes all cubes of that color.  
6. Starting with the youngest player and proceeding clockwise, each player places 2 cubes in any region.  
7. Then, starting with the last player and proceeding counter-clockwise, each player places 2 more cubes in any region.  
8. Place the 6 class cards face-up beside the board.  
9. The youngest player takes the first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On each turn, the active player performs the following phases in order (A and B may be swapped):

**A. Pick a Class Card (Optional)**  
- Take one class card from the unused pool or from another player.  
- Cards remain with the player until taken.  
- A player may hold multiple cards and uses all their abilities.

**B. Place Cubes and Use Card Abilities (Optional)**  
- Place cubes in one region equal to the number of rats currently in it.  
- If holding the **Peasant**, place one additional cube (e.g., 4 cubes in a 3-rat region; 1 cube in a 0-rat region).  
- Use abilities of held class cards (see Core Mechanics).  
- Actions may be done in any order; skipping is allowed.

**C. Move the Plague Piece (Required)**  
1. Move the Plague piece to an adjacent region (must move, cannot stay).  
   - If holding **Knight**, may move up to two regions.  
2. **Spread Rats:**  
   - If the new region has **1 rat**, place 1 new rat in any adjacent region.  
   - If the new region has **2 or more rats**, place 2 new rats in adjacent region(s) (1 each in two regions or 2 in one).  
   - Cannot place more than 3 rats in any region.  
3. **Plague Ravages (if region has ≥1 rat and ≥1 cube):**  
   - Reveal rat tokens one at a time.  
   - For each token:  
     - If total cubes in region ≥ token’s limit value, plague activates.  
     - Resolve effects:  
       - **M (Majority):** Remove one cube from player(s) with most cubes (tie → all tied lose one).  
       - **A (All):** Each player with cubes loses one.  
       - **Class symbols:** Each holder of corresponding class card loses one cube (if present).  
     - M symbols resolve first; others in any order.  
   - After resolving a token, remove it from the game.  
   - If all cubes are removed, stop revealing rats.  
   - If holding **Knight**, may declare before revealing that the Plague piece counts as 2 neutral cubes for limit checks.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Class Cards (Base Game):**  
  - **Peasant:** +1 cube when placing (can place in 0-rat region).  
  - **Merchant:** Move up to 3 of your cubes to a neighboring region.  
  - **Monk:** Move one rat token to a neighboring region (before/after placing cubes).  
  - **Witch:** Look at two rat tokens (same or different regions), optionally swap them.  
  - **King:** Move one of your cubes from a rat-free region to the palace (safe for rest of game).  
  - **Knight:** Move Plague up to 2 regions; may count Plague piece as 2 neutral cubes during plague phase.  

- **Rat Limits & Effects:**  
  - Max 3 rats per region.  
  - Only revealed rats with sufficient population trigger effects.  
  - M resolves first, then A and class symbols.  
  - Tokens are removed after resolution.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Triggers (after a player’s turn):**  
- All rat tokens are used.  
- A player has placed all their cubes on the board.  

**Final Round:**  
1. Play one partial round counter-clockwise, starting with the player to the right of the last full-turn player.  
2. Players may only use abilities of cards they already hold.  
   - Cannot take new cards.  
   - Cannot place cubes (except **Peasant**: may place 1 cube in any region).  
   - Cannot move Plague (except **Knight**: may move up to 2 regions; counts as 2 neutral cubes at end).  
3. After final round, resolve plague in **all regions**:  
   - Reveal and resolve all remaining rat tokens one by one.  
   - The last full-turn player decides the order of resolution.  
   - Apply all effects normally.

**Scoring:**  
- Count all surviving cubes on the board (including in the palace).  
- Player with the most cubes wins.  
- Tiebreaker: The tied player who would have taken the next turn wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip placing cubes or using card abilities?** Yes. All optional actions may be skipped.  
- **Can I use multiple card abilities in any order?** Yes, as long as they are used before moving the Plague (except Knight).  
- **What if all neighboring regions have 3 rats during spread?** No rats are placed.  
- **Can Witch swap a rat with itself?** No—swap only makes sense between two different regions.  
- **Does Knight’s +2 cubes affect M/A/class effects?** No—only affects whether the limit is met.  
- **Can King move a cube from a region that now has rats but didn’t when the turn started?** No—cube must be in a rat-free region at time of move.  
- **Can cubes in the palace be targeted by other cards?** No—only safe from plague, but can be moved or affected by card actions (e.g., Merchant, Courier).
