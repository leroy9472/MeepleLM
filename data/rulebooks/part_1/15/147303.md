## Carcassonne: South Seas — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Carcassonne: South Seas is a tile-placement game set in a tropical archipelago. Players build islands, sea regions, and bridges while collecting resources—shells, bananas, and fish. The goal is to earn the most points by strategically placing islanders (meeples) on features to claim and score them, and by acquiring valuable ships through market dominance.

2. Components  
- Sea tiles featuring islands, sea regions, bridges, and resource symbols (shells, bananas, fish)  
- Islander meeples (in player colors)  
- Fishing Boats (used to mark fish groups during evaluation)  
- Ships with point values  
- Wares (shells, bananas, fish) collected during gameplay  
- 4 face-up market slots for ships  

3. Setup  
- Place the starting sea tile (typically with a mix of island, sea, and bridge features) in the center.  
- Each player chooses a color and takes the corresponding islanders.  
- Shuffle the remaining sea tiles and place them face-down.  
- Draw 4 ships randomly and place them face-up in the market area.  
- Players begin with no wares or ships.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, follow these steps in order:  
1. **Place a Sea Tile**  
   - Draw and place one sea tile adjacent to existing tiles.  
   - All edges must align: land to land, sea to sea.  
   - The tile must form valid connections.  

2. **Place or Retrieve an Islander (Optional Action)**  
   - **Option 2a: Place an Islander**  
     - Place one of your islanders on a feature of the newly placed tile (e.g., island, bridge, sea region).  
     - Only one islander may occupy a single feature at a time.  
   - **Option 2b: Retrieve an Islander**  
     - Retrieve one of your previously placed islanders from any completed or active feature.  
     - This may be done instead of placing, or not at all.  

3. **Evaluate Completed Features**  
   - Immediately score any feature that is now fully surrounded or enclosed:  
     - **Bridge (Shell Collector):** Score 1 shell per shell symbol on the bridge.  
     - **Island (Banana Picker):** Score 1 banana per banana symbol on the island.  
     - **Sea Region (Fisherman):** Score 1 fish per fish symbol in the sea region.  
     - After scoring, the islander remains in place if the feature is not fully resolved (e.g., open-ended).  
   - If a Fishing Boat triggers the evaluation (e.g., by completing a sea region), place the Fishing Boat token over the group of fish to mark it as scored.  

4. **Deliver to 1 Ship**  
   - Deliver collected wares (shells, bananas, fish) to one of the 4 face-up ships in the market.  
   - Each ship has a delivery requirement (e.g., 2 shells and 1 banana).  
   - If you meet the requirement, acquire the ship and remove it from the market.  
   - Draw a new ship to refill the market.  
   - Delivered wares are returned to the supply.  

5. Markets: Value Only During Game  
   - The **Merchant** on a market evaluates the 4 face-up ships.  
   - The player who owns the highest-point-valued ship among the 4 currently face-up earns control of the market.  
   - Market value is tracked during the game but does not directly award points.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when either:  
  - All sea tiles have been placed, or  
  - All ships have been acquired.  
- **Final Scoring:**  
  - Players score points equal to the sum of all acquired ships.  
  - Additionally, score 1 point for every 3 remaining wares (shells, bananas, fish) rounded down.  
  - Example: 7 wares = 2 points.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I both place and retrieve an islander on the same turn?**  
  No. You may place, retrieve, or do neither—but not both.  
- **What happens when a sea region is evaluated by a Fishing Boat?**  
  Score 1 fish per fish symbol in the region, then place a Fishing Boat token over it to prevent re-scoring.  
- **Can I deliver to a ship I already own?**  
  No. Deliveries can only be made to face-up ships in the market.  
- **What if I don’t meet any ship’s delivery requirement?**  
  You skip the delivery phase. You may still retrieve or place an islander.  
- **Are incomplete features scored at game end?**  
  No. Only completed features are scored during the game. Incomplete features do not score.  
- **Can I deliver partial goods to a ship over multiple turns?**  
  No. Deliveries must fulfill the full requirement in a single turn.
