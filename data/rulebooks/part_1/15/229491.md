### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Edge of Darkness*, players lead one of four powerful Guilds in the city of Aegis, a beacon of civilization on the edge of the Forsaken Lands — a blighted region corrupted by dark forces. The city is under threat from the spreading Blight, a malevolent force that sends creatures to destabilize human realms. The Guilds must defend Aegis while vying for influence, wealth, and prestige. The game ends after eight rounds, and the player with the most Victory Points wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game consists of a **Prologue** round followed by **eight rounds**, each with two phases:
- **Assembly Phase** (all players simultaneously, then in turn)
- **Action Phase** (in turn order)

After each round, pass the First Player marker to the right and advance the Round marker.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Cards and Advancements
- A **card** is a sleeve containing a Citizen/Patrician base and any advancements.
- An **advancement** is a double-sided slip: Contact (City side) and Threat (Blight side).
- **Sleeving**: Add an advancement to a card in a matching empty slot (top, middle, bottom). Top slots may cover existing base cards.

#### Shared Deck and Street
- One shared deck feeds the **Street** — 5 cards laid out, with the top card of the deck as the 6th.
- Players draft cards from the Street during Assembly Phase.
- **Drafting**: Take the rightmost card unless you pay 1 Influence to skip it. Skipped Influence becomes Goodwill (worth ¼ VP).
- **Depleted Deck**: When ≤6 cards remain, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

#### Allegiance
- **Guild Cards** have a player’s banner; **Neutral Cards** have none.
- Claim Allegiance of a Neutral card by adding your Allegiance slip. The card becomes yours.
- Other players must pay you 1 Coin to resolve effects on your cards.

#### Agents
- **Trained Agents** can be dispatched or returned using card effects.
- **Untrained Agents** (6 off-board) can be trained using Train effects.
- Only trained Agents may be dispatched.

#### Threat Tower and Blight Attacks
- During Assembly Phase, players draw cubes based on cube icons on cards in hand and place them in their Threat Zone.
- During Action Phase, drop all cubes from hand into the tower.
- A **Blight Attack** occurs if a tray has:
  - 6+ cubes (2 players)
  - 7+ cubes (3 players)
  - 8+ cubes (4 players)
- The player(s) with the most cubes in the tray are attacked (black cubes attack all players if tied for most).
- The attacking card’s total Damage is compared to player’s defenses.
- If Damage > defense, the player loses 1 space on Defense Track.
- If Damage ≤ 0, the player successfully defends and gains 1 Reputation.
- After attack, discard the card (to owner’s Guild Hall) and replace it from the bottom of the deck.

#### Hunting Threats
- Use **Hunt Threats** ability to defeat threats in the tower.
- Total Battle Strength must be ≥ threat’s Damage.
- Spend Battle Strength equal to Damage to defeat it.
- Gain rewards listed on the threat.
- Remove all cubes from the threat’s tray.
- Replace the threat from the bottom of the deck.

#### Resolving Effects
- After dropping cubes and resolving attacks, sleeve one advancement and resolve effects.
- You may resolve effects in any order.
- Resolving effects on **another player’s card** costs 1 Coin paid to that player.
- Neutral cards are free to use.

#### Discard Rules
- Discard all cards in hand at end of Action Phase.
- **Neutral cards** → Discard pile
- **Your cards** → Discard pile
- **Other players’ cards** → Owner’s Guild Hall
- Cards discarded from anywhere except your hand go to owner’s Guild Hall.

#### Optional Actions (During Action Phase)
- **Discard 1 card**: Return 1 of your Agents from any location to Trained Agents pool.
- **Discard 2 cards**: Use 1 effect from any card in the Street (pay 1 Coin if owned by another player).

### 6. Scoring & End Game

1. **Gain Goodwill**: 1 Goodwill token per filled slot on cards in your Guild Hall and in your cards in the Street (including top of deck).
2. **Collect All Cards**: Gather all your cards from all zones.
3. **Bonus Reputation**:
   - Most Reputation tokens: +2 (tied: +1 each)
   - Most trained Agents: +2 (tied: +1 each)
   - Most Guild cards: +2 (tied: +1 each)
   - Highest on Defense Track: +2 (tied: +1 each)
4. **Victory Points**:
   - 1 VP per Reputation token
   - 1 VP per trained Agent
   - 1 VP per filled slot on your Guild cards
   - VP equal to current Defense Track space
   - ¼ VP each for Coin, Influence, and Goodwill tokens (fractions count)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hand Size**: No maximum; keep cards visible.
- **Skipping Cards**: You may skip up to 5 cards; cannot skip top of deck.
- **Goodwill**: Flipped Influence from skipped cards; cannot be spent, worth ¼ VP.
- **Blight Attack Resolution**: Resolve left to right; each attack is independent.
- **Multiple Players Attacked**: Each defends separately; outcomes do not affect others.
- **Battle Strength**: Lost if not used; only for hunting, not defense.
- **Ties in Scoring**: Use tiebreakers in order: most Guild cards → most trained Agents → highest combined Coin and Influence.
- **Solo Play**: Use Voiceless Guild rules with Action and Choice cards (see Solo Rules).
