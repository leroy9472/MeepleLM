## Duelosaur Island — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are the CEO of a dinosaur theme park competing against another player to attract the most visitors before the endgame threshold is reached. Build dinosaurs and attractions, manage threats, and leverage public relations to gain an edge. The game ends when a player reaches or exceeds the pre-selected visitor threshold (25, 35, or 45). After completing the final round, players score points (represented as Visitors) and the player with the most wins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Phase 1: Income  
Each player gains:  
- **Coins**: 3 + 1 per Food (fork/knife) icon in park + 2 per yellow-cornered income space passed or reached on Excitement track  
- **Park Cards**: 1 + 1 extra per Merch (t-shirt) icon in park  
  - Draw from face-up row or top of deck  
  - Refill face-up row immediately after taking a card  

> **Optional**: Before drawing cards, spend 1 coin to discard all 3 face-up cards and refill the row. Only once per player per round.

#### Phase 2: Draft  
- **First player**:  
  - Draws 3 Specialist cards, discards 1, places 2 face-up on Draft Board  
  - Draws 5 dice from bag, rolls, assigns each to a slot above a Plot Twist token (5 slots)  
- **Drafting Order**: Starting with second player, players alternate choosing one item (Die/Plot Twist pair or Specialist card) until each has 3 items.  
  - **Drafting a Die**:  
    - Gain rewards shown on the die and modified by the Plot Twist beneath it  
    - Move DNA cubes accordingly  
    - Die with "Lock" symbol: increase Security by 1 without cost  
  - **Drafting a Specialist Card**:  
    - May keep it (add to right of player board) or discard it for bonus at bottom of card  
    - Maximum 3 Specialists; if a 4th is acquired, discard one (no bonus)  
- **Leftover Item**:  
  - 1 item remains undrafted (die or specialist)  
  - Place it in the threat area; it adds 0–3 temporary Threat (shown on item) during Phase 4  

#### Phase 3: Build  
Players act simultaneously and may perform any action in any order, multiple times:  

- **Create a Dinosaur**  
  - Tuck a Park Card (from hand) under top of player board (Dino visible, Attraction hidden)  
  - Pay DNA cost (move cubes down DNA tracks)  
  - Increase Excitement (black/green triangle) and Threat (red dots) as shown on card  
  - If Threat > 10, use +10 red circle marker  

- **Build an Attraction**  
  - Tuck a Park Card under bottom of player board (Attraction visible, Dino hidden)  
  - Pay coin cost shown  
  - Gain benefits:  
    - Food/Merch icons: apply in next Income phase  
    - Ride icon: gain bonus under PR marker (twice if two Ride icons)  

- **Mix DNA**  
  - Discard 1 Park Card from hand  
  - Then:  
    - Convert 2 basic DNA → 1 advanced DNA (any colors)  
    - OR convert 1 advanced DNA → 2 basic DNA (any colors)  

- **Sell DNA**  
  - Spend:  
    - 2 basic DNA OR  
    - 1 advanced DNA  
  - Gain 1 coin per transaction  

- **Increase Security**  
  - Move Security marker up 1 space  
  - Pay coins equal to the value of the new space  
  - If Security > 10, use +10 lock marker  

#### Phase 4: Visitors  
Resolve in order:  

1. **Threat vs Security Check**  
   - Add temporary Threat from undrafted item (0–3)  
   - If **Threat > Security**: lose 2 × (Threat − Security) in Visitors  
     - If loss would reduce Visitors below 1, stay at 1 and gain 1 Lawsuit token (max 1 per round)  

2. **Gain Visitors**  
   - Gain number of Visitors equal to current Excitement level  

3. **Choose PR Bonuses**  
   - Player with **lower Excitement** chooses first  
   - If tied:  
     - Fewer cards in park chooses first  
     - Still tied: current round’s first player chooses first  
   - First player takes **any** PR bonus to the **left** of the PR marker  
   - Second player takes **any** PR bonus to the **left** of the one just taken  

#### Phase 5: Round End  
- Discard down to maximum 3 Park Cards in hand  
- Remove all dice and Specialist cards from Draft Board  
- Leave Plot Twist tokens in place  
- Move PR marker 1 space to the right (if possible)  
- Switch turn order: other player becomes first player (receives dice bag)  
- Begin next round  

> **Endgame Check**: After this phase, if any player has reached or exceeded the visitor threshold, complete the round and proceed to scoring.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Final scoring converts all assets into Visitors (points):  

- **Dinosaurs**: Add Visitors shown in lower-left corner of each Dinosaur card  
- **Attractions**: Add Visitors shown in lower-right corner of each **$5-cost Attraction**  
- **Attraction Sets**: 4 Visitors per set of 3 different icons (Ride, Food, Merch)  
- **Specialists**: Add Visitors as specified on card  
- **Lawsuits**: Lose 5 Visitors per Lawsuit token  

**Winner**: Player with most total Visitors  
**Tiebreaker**: Most Dinosaurs in park. If still tied, play again.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I mix DNA without discarding a card?**  
  No. Discarding a Park Card is required for both DNA mixing directions.  

- **Can I sell DNA to gain coins even if I can’t spend them?**  
  Yes. Selling DNA is always allowed if you have the DNA.  

- **What happens to Plot Twist tokens between rounds?**  
  They stay on the Draft Board. Only dice and Specialists are cleared.  

- **Can I choose not to increase Security even if I can afford it?**  
  Yes. All Build actions are optional.  

- **Do I gain PR bonuses if the PR marker is at the far left?**  
  No. If no bonuses are to the left of the marker, no player gains a PR bonus.  

- **Can I discard a Specialist at any time?**  
  Yes, but only for no effect (you don’t gain the discard bonus unless it’s part of drafting).  

- **What if both players have same Excitement and same number of cards?**  
  First player of the round chooses PR bonus first.  

- **Can I use DNA gained during Draft phase immediately in Build phase?**  
  Yes. DNA gained in Draft is available immediately in Build.
