# Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Ahoy, players take on the roles of one of four factions—Bluefin Squadron, Mollusk Union, or one of two Smuggler factions—competing for Fame on the high seas. The Bluefin Squadron and Mollusk Union gain Fame through area control by dominating regions. The Smugglers gain Fame by delivering Cargo cards, which also increases regional wealth, indirectly benefiting the controlling faction. The game ends at the end of any round where a player has at least 30 Fame. The player with the most Fame wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most gold wins.

   - 4 players: All four factions  
3. Seat players clockwise: Bluefin, Smuggler (3/4), Mollusk, Smuggler (4 only).  
4. Shuffle 12 region tiles, return one to the box, place 11 facedown.  
5. Draw 2 region tiles, place them adjacent with Islands opposite.  
6. Place a "1" wealth die on each face-up region tile.  
7. For 2–3 players: Remove one random Market card of each suit, then shuffle and deal 3 face-up.

   - Mollusk: Place Flagship and 2 Comrades on empty Island, draw 2 Plan cards, place 6 Comrades in Ready.  
   - Second Smuggler (4 players): Same as first.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Rounds proceed with players taking turns in clockwise order, starting with Bluefin.  
- Each player must place exactly 2 action dice per turn (Bluefin places 3 dice over 3 turns).  
- Actions are resolved immediately after placing a die.  
- After all dice are placed, the round ends.  
- End of Round:  
  1. Score Fame: Bluefin and Mollusk gain Fame equal to wealth die for each region they control.  
  2. Adjust Wealth: 2-player games—first player increases one wealth die by 1.  
  3. Reroll all action dice.  
  4. Pass First Player card clockwise.  
- Game ends if any player has ≥30 Fame. Smugglers score pledged Cargo, then highest Fame wins.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Movement**:  
  - Sail: Move 1–2 spaces orthogonally.  
  - Tailwind: Move directly to any space with a printed die matching placed die.  
  - Full Sail (Smuggler): Move up to die value in spaces.  
  - Moving off map triggers Exploring: draw new region tile, place adjacent, add "1" wealth die.  
- **Battling**:  
  - Triggered when moving into space with enemy figure and at least one side has loaded Cannons.  
  - Attacker chooses defender, both may lower Cannons die to add to roll.  
  - Roll 1 battle die each; higher total wins (attacker wins ties).  
  - Winner resolves one Battle Victory option.  
- **Cannons**:  
  - Place die on Cannons to load. Can lower die during battle to add to roll.  
- **Recruiting Crew**:  
  - At Island, pay die or gold cost to recruit Market card into Crew.  
- **Damage & Repair**:  
  - Wreckage or battle victory deals damage. Place damage token on empty die slot.  
  - Repair: Remove up to 2 damage tokens.  
- **Cargo (Smugglers)**:  
  - Smuggle: Take Market card matching Island suit, up to 2 Cargo.  
  - Deliver: At Island matching Cargo’s Deliver suit. Gain 2 Fame, increase region wealth by 1, gain Reward, pledge Cargo.  
- **Control & Scoring**:  
  - Bluefin: Patrol (+1), Stronghold (+2), Flagship (+2)  
  - Mollusk: Comrade (+1), Ship (+1), Flagship (+1), Cutter doubles Comrade control  
  - Highest control scores Fame = wealth die; tie = no score.

  - Bluefin/Mollusk: Fame from controlled regions.  
  - Smugglers: 1 Fame per pledged Cargo × number of matching-suited regions controlled by pledged faction.
