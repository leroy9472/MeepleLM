## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the roles of squires training at Medieval Academy to become knights. Over six turns, they compete across seven disciplines—Gallantry, Jousts, Tournaments, Education, King’s Service, Quests, and Charity—by playing Learning cards to advance on tracks and earn Chivalry Points via Coats of Arms. The squire with the most Chivalry Points at the end of turn 6 wins and is knighted by King Arthur. In case of a tie, the player highest on the Gallantry track wins.

- Determine first player (e.g., best chivalrous pose); they take Excalibur.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has 6 phases:

#### 1. Deal Cards  
First player shuffles and deals 5 Learning cards face down to each player.

#### 2. Draft Cards  
- Players choose 1 card to keep, pass remaining to adjacent player.  
- Direction alternates per turn:  
  - Turn I: Pass left (clockwise)  
  - Turn II: Pass right (counterclockwise)  
  - Continue alternating.  
- Repeat until each player has kept 5 cards (one from each draft round).  
- Players then hold 5 cards in hand.

#### 3. Play Cards  
- Starting with first player, then clockwise, each player plays 1 card per round for 4 rounds.  
- On playing a card:  
  - Move own disc forward on corresponding board by card value (2–5).  
  - Jousts/Tournaments cards may be played on **either** Jousts or Tournaments board (not both; value cannot split).  
- After 4 cards played, 1 card remains unplayed (discarded).  
- Stacking: If multiple discs occupy a space, stack them; top disc is ranked higher.  
- Full lap (20 spaces): For non-King’s Service boards only, take a reserve disc and stack it on top. Movement now applies to the stack.

#### 4. Scoring  
Score boards that trigger this turn (per icon on board). Begin with Gallantry, then others.

##### Gallantry Board  
- No Chivalry Points awarded. Instead:  
  - 3rd place: Move any one of your discs up 1 space  
  - 2nd place: Move any one of your discs up 2 spaces  
  - 1st place: Move any one of your discs up 3 spaces  
- Movement applies to **one disc only** (cannot split).  
- Rankings fixed at start of scoring; moving a disc on Gallantry does not change rank.

##### Jousts, Tournaments, Quests  
- Award Coats of Arms:  
  - 1st: 3pt  
  - 2nd: 2pt  
  - 3rd: 1pt  
- In 3-player games: 3rd place receives nothing.

##### Education, Charity  
- Award negative Chivalry Points:  
  - 2nd to last: -1pt  
  - Last: -3pt  
- All players on space 0 are considered last (tie).  
- If multiple players tie for last, no -1pt awarded (only -3pt to all on 0).  
- In 3-player games: 3rd place receives nothing.

##### King’s Service  
- Based on position, not rank:  
  - Spaces 0–5: 0pt  
  - Spaces 6–11: 6pt  
  - Space 12: 12pt  
- Coats of Arms awarded to all qualifying players.

#### 5. Reset  
After Turn 3 (end of Phase 4):  
- Discs on Gallantry, Jousts, Tournaments, Education, and King’s Service return to space 0.  
- Quests and Charity boards do **not** reset.

#### 6. Change First Player  
- Excalibur passes to player on the left.  
- Advance hourglass to next turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Drafting**: Alternating direction each turn.  
- **Movement**: Discs move up tracks based on card values. Stacking determines rank in ties.  
- **Bonus Actions**: Gallantry scoring gives movement bonuses.  
- **Negative Scoring**: Education and Charity penalize lower ranks.  
- **Full Lap Rule**: On 20-space tracks, completing a lap adds a second disc to stack (cannot occur on King’s Service, max 12 spaces).  
- **3-Player Rule**: 3rd place earns nothing on Gallantry, Jousts, Tournaments, Quests.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after Turn 6 scoring.  
- Total all Chivalry Points from Coats of Arms (positive and negative).  
- Highest total wins.  
- Tiebreaker: Player highest on Gallantry track wins.

---

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Ties on tracks**: Disc on top ranks higher. Exception: All discs on space 0 are tied for last.  
- **Unplayed card**: Discarded after 4 played.  
- **Stack movement**: When a stack moves, entire stack moves together.  
- **Bonus movement from Gallantry**: Can be used on any board, including Gallantry itself.  
- **Reserve discs**: Used only when a disc completes a full lap (20 spaces).  
- **King’s Service cap**: Max space is 12; cannot loop.
