### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in a specific order. On your turn:  

#### 1. Play Your Hand  
- Place your hand into your Play Area.  
  a. First resolve any **Discard/Draw** effects.  
  b. Then resolve other card effects.  

#### 2. Use Speed to Move and/or Hunt  
- Use your remaining Speed (after card effects) to:  
  a. **Move**: Move up to your Speed value.  
     - Trigger the **board effect** of the space where you end your movement.  
     - If landing on a space with other Vampires, you may **push** them one at a time (starting from the topmost) to an adjacent space.  
  b. **Hunt**: After moving (or choosing not to move), spend leftover Speed to take one or more cards from the Hunt Track.  
     - You may take a card only if you have enough leftover Speed to afford it (cost shown on card).  
     - Cards with immediate effects trigger upon being taken.  
     - Place hunted cards in your **discard pile**, **except**:  
       - **Familiars** and **Roses** may be placed on top of your draw deck or in your discard pile.  
  c. **Gain Points**: Apply point modifiers. Watch for:  
     - $+1$ from the $\widehat{\mathbf{a}}$ symbol  
     - $+2$ from the  symbol  

#### 3. End Turn

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Turn Order  
Turns proceed in this order:  

1. **By Region**:  
   1. Forest  
   2. Plains  
   3. Mountains  
   4. Cemetery  

2. **Within Same Region**:  
   a. Road  
   b. Railroad  
   c. Boat Path  

3. **Same Region and Path**:  
   i. Farthest from the castle moves first  
   ii. If tied, Vampires **on top** of another (stacked) go first  

#### Board Effects  
- **Cemetery**:  
  - Cannot be pushed while here.  
  - Cannot hunt Humans here.  
- **Chest**: Take token and score 2 points. Flip token face down after use. Unlimited uses.  
- **Crypt**: Draw all missions, choose one. May replace any number of old missions with new ones.  
- **Labyrinth**: Instead of hunting, take 1 Rose of your choice at no cost.  
- **Market, Church, Mansion, Barracks**: Trigger **Digestion** effect (see variant).  
- **Well**: Grants +1 Hunt, but only usable from the column where the Well is located.  
- **Tavern**: May hunt **all facedown cards** present for 2 Speed. Must keep all cards taken.  
- **Ship**: Cannot hunt on a Ship.  

#### Bonus Tokens  
Each grants a special ability:  
- Counts as 1 human of corresponding type for missions.  
- Choose human type at end of game (flexible token).  
- **Gregarious symbol (+1 in bat)**: Grants +1 Hunt this turn.  
- Discard 1 card, then draw 1 card.  
- Choose 1 mission from any stack.  
- Grants 1 extra turn at end of game (no Hunt allowed).  

#### Card Effects  
- Some cards grant bonus points at game end.  
- Some count toward Wolf sets for end-game scoring.  
- Some allow choosing a mission from any stack.  
- **Spicy Card (errata)**: Use all Speed to reach closest Well.  
  - If you reach it: discard the card, stop, and may use leftover Speed to hunt.  
  - If you don’t: end turn, keep card in Play Area.  
- **Errata**: Catarina’s card refers to herself, not Nora.  

#### Digestion Variant (Optional)  
- **Setup**:  
  - Place Digestion tokens on Market, Church, Mansion, Barracks.  
  - Set 4 matching Digestion cards face down nearby.  
- **Trigger**: Landing on a Digestion space.

  - Take the matching Digestion card and 1 random from the remaining 3. Place both face up in front of you.  
  - After your turn, you may **digest 1 human** from your Play Area or discard pile matching **either** of the two human types shown.  
  - Includes humans hunted this turn.  
  - Return all 4 Digestion cards face down after turn.  

#### Rest & Digest (Optional Rule)  
At the start of your turn:

- And your total Speed is **zero or negative**  
Then you may **Rest & Digest**:
