## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Dungeon Twister is set on the planet Targane, where the Arch-Mage, a powerful sorcerer, constructs mechanical labyrinths called Dungeon Twisters to entertain himself by teleporting creatures into deadly trials. Players control teams of adventurers trapped in these labyrinths, battling enemies, navigating traps, and attempting to escape.

**Objective:** Be the first player to earn 5 Victory Points (VP). VP are earned by:  
- Eliminating an opponent’s character: 1 VP  
- Escaping the labyrinth with a character: 1 VP  
- Escaping with the Treasure: +1 VP (total 2 VP for that character)  
- Escaping with the Goblin: 2 VP (instead of 1)

### 2. Components  
- 8 square rooms (4x2 layout)  
- 2 starting lines (1 per player)  
- 2 quick-reference screens  
- 2 sets of tokens:  
  - 8 character tokens per player (Cleric, Goblin, Mekanork, Thief, Troll, Wall-Walker, Warrior, Wizard)  
  - 6 object tokens per player (Treasure, Speed Potion, Rope, Fireball Wand, Sword, Armor)  
- 2 sets of cardboard figurines and plastic bases  
- 2 decks of 16 cards per player:  
  - 9 Combat cards (+0 to +6)

### 3. Setup  
1. **Board**: Shuffle the 8 rooms face-down and arrange them into a 4×2 rectangle.  
2. **Starting Lines**: Each player places their starting line at opposite ends of the board.  
3. **Teams**: Each player chooses 4 of their 8 characters and places them face-down on their starting line (on the 4 large dots).  
4. **Hidden Tokens**: Remaining 4 characters and 6 objects are placed face-down in any rooms (max capacity per room respected). Players alternate placing one token at a time, starting with a randomly chosen player.  
5. **Cards**: Each player takes their 16-card deck and places it face-down.  
6. **Reveal**: Both players reveal their 4 starting characters. Screens are laid down as reference guides.  
7. **First Player**: Randomly determine who goes first.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has three phases:  
1. **Play an Action Card**:  
   - Choose and play one Action card from hand.  
   - First player must play "2 Actions".  
   - Subsequent cards in the first cycle must be within ±1 of the highest card played so far.  
   - All Action cards are stacked face-up; only the top card is visible.  
2. **Use Actions**:  
   - Spend Action Points (AP) from the played card.  
   - Each AP allows one action: move, reveal, rotate, attack, use ability, or use object.  
   - Actions must be fully completed before starting another (1st Golden Rule).  
3. **Recycle Action Cards**:  
   - If a player has no Action cards left, they take back all 4 Action cards (not Combat or Jump cards).  
   - This completes an Action Card Cycle.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Movement  
- Characters move orthogonally (never diagonally).  
- Movement range per AP is based on character Speed:  
  - Elf Scout (7), Pickpocket (6), Thief (5), Cleric/Wizard/Paladin/Illusionist (4), Warrior/Mekanork (3), Troll (2)  
- Characters can:  
  - Move through objects, friendly characters, wounded enemies, open/broken Portcullis  
  - Stop on objects and friendly wounded characters  
  - Pick up or drop objects/wounded during movement (no AP cost)  
- Characters cannot:  
  - Move diagonally  
  - Move through enemy characters, walls, Pit Traps, or closed Portcullis  
  - End movement on a Pit Trap or with >2 tokens in one square (2nd Golden Rule)

#### Golden Rules  
- **1st Golden Rule**: An action must be fully completed before starting a new one.  
- **2nd Golden Rule**: At most two tokens (character + object or character + wounded ally) may occupy the same square at the end of any action. Markers (e.g., Open Portcullis) do not count.

#### Combat  
- Spend 1 AP to attack an adjacent enemy.  
- Both players play one Combat card face-down; reveal simultaneously.  
- Add card value to attacker’s/defender’s Combat stat. Higher total wins.  
- Loser is wounded (token flipped face-down).  
- Tie: no effect; attacker may spend another AP to retry.  
- Wounded characters:  
  - Combat value = 0  
  - Cannot initiate combat or use abilities  
  - Can defend if attacked  
  - Lose if they lose combat (removed, +1 VP to winner)  
- **Group Combat**: If multiple characters are adjacent to enemy, all must participate. Only one Combat card played per side. All losing characters are wounded.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a character move through a friendly character carrying an object?**  
  Yes, but cannot stop there (would violate 2nd Golden Rule).  
- **Can the Thief deactivate a Pit Trap while wounded?**  
  No. If wounded on Pit Trap without Rope, dies immediately.  
- **Can the Wizard attack through a Pit Trap?**  
  Yes, if in line of sight and adjacent. Levitation allows movement over, but combat is separate.  
- **Can you rotate a room not yet revealed?**  
  No. Only revealed rooms can be rotated.  
- **Can multiple players use the same Rope?**  
  Yes. Rope stays on Pit Trap until picked up.  
- **Can the Cleric heal through an open Portcullis?**  
  Yes. Only closed Portcullis blocks healing.  
- **Can a character carry an object and a wounded character?**  
  Only Paladin. Others can carry one or the other.
