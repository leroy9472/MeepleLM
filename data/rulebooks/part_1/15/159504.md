# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Folklore: The Affliction is a cooperative narrative-driven adventure game where players take on the roles of investigators combating supernatural threats across a dark, myth-laden world. The objective is to complete story-driven missions, defeat creatures and afflictions, gather lore, and grow in power to overcome increasingly difficult challenges. Victory is achieved by completing the story goals. Defeat occurs when all characters are eliminated and sent to limbo.

## 2. Components
- Character cards, minis/standees, and record sheets  
- World Map and Adventure Maps  
- Creature, Affliction, Item, Ability, Prayer, Ritual, and Recipe decks  
- Power Point (PP), Vita, and Ghost Point (GP) tracking cards  
- Skirmish strength tokens and dice (d10, d100)  
- Status and condition tokens (e.g., Infection, Corruption, Wanted)  
- Event cards (Road, Off-Road)  
- Town service and leader tokens  

## 3. Setup
1. Choose characters and take starting abilities, items, and equipment as listed in their booklets. Optionally customize abilities using 3 ability points.
2. Place the World Map and set the group marker at the starting location.
3. Shuffle all decks except Ability, Creature, and Affliction decks (arrange alphabetically).
4. Each player places their character card, tokens, and tracking cards. Equip starting items.
5. Set Power and Vita trackers to starting values. Ghost Points start at 10 when a character dies.
6. Choose a story and note it on the session sheet.
7. Give the Leader token (Day side up) to the starting leader. Number players clockwise.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
- **World Map Phase**: The leader moves the group marker. After movement:
  - On a road: draw and resolve a Road Event card.

  - In a town: use town services.
  - Flip the Day/Night token and pass it to the next player.
- **Adventuring Phase**: Enter an adventure map when instructed.
  - Each round has three phases: Resting (optional), Character Actions, and Map/Leader Transition.
  - Characters act in clockwise order from the leader.
- **Encounters/Skirmishes**: Triggered by events or story prompts.
  - Skirmishes are resolved via group dice rolls.
  - Encounters use tactical map-based combat with movement and positioning.
- **Resting**: Once per chapter, the leader may rest. All characters recover 4 Vita, 4 PP, and 4 GP. Roll d10: on 1–3, a skirmish occurs.
- **Story Progression**: Complete story objectives, transition maps, and advance through chapters.
