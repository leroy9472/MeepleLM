## THE GATE OF THE PYRAMID – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are treasure seekers racing to solve ancient tetris-style puzzles within the mystical pyramid. The faster and more accurately you solve puzzles, the further you advance on the pyramid board to claim the most valuable gems. The player with the most impressive collection — specifically, the most jewels of a single color — after 9 rounds wins the game.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Large Gem Board (main board with Egyptian hex spaces)  
- 36 Double-Sided Puzzle Boards (two difficulty levels: green border = normal, red border = expert)  
- 48 Polyomino Tiles (4 sets of 12 unique tetris-style tiles, each set a different color)  
- 4 Player Tokens (plastic pyramids, one per player)  
- 78 Gems (13 gems in each of 6 colors)  
- 4 Jewel Mats (player holders for collected gems)  
- 1 Hourglass Timer  
- 1 Custom Symbol Die  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Determine Puzzle Boards by Player Count**:  
   - 2 players: Remove 18 puzzle boards (18 remain)  
   - 3 players: Remove 9 puzzle boards (27 remain)  
   - 4 players: Use all 36 puzzle boards  

2. **Choose Difficulty**:  
   - Select either normal (green border) or expert (red border) side. All players use the same difficulty.  
   - Shuffle puzzle boards and place them facedown in a stack.

3. **Prepare the Main Board**:  
   - Place the large gem board in the center.  
   - Randomly place one gem into each hole on the board.

4. **Distribute Player Components**:  
   - Each player receives:  
     - 12 unique polyomino tiles (no duplicates in shape or color)  
     - 1 jewel mat (holder)  
     - 1 plastic pyramid token  

5. **Place Neutral Components**:  
   - Place the hourglass and die within reach of all players.

6. **Starting Positions**:  
   - Each player places their pyramid token on any Egyptian hex space on the main board (no restrictions).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each of the 9 rounds proceeds as follows:

1. **Start Player & Turn Order**:  
   - Randomly choose the first player. Play proceeds clockwise.  
   - The starting player rolls the die and immediately flips the hourglass.

2. **Puzzle Assignment**:  
   - Each player draws one puzzle board from the top of the facedown stack and places it face up.  
   - The die symbol determines which polyomino tiles to use. Players must use only the tiles adjacent to the matching symbol on their puzzle board.

3. **Solving Phase**:  
   - All players simultaneously attempt to cover all white squares on their puzzle board using only the selected tiles.  
   - Rules for tile placement:  
     - Tiles may be rotated or flipped.  
     - Tiles must not overlap.  
     - Tiles must not extend beyond the black border.  
   - The goal is to completely cover all white squares.

4. **Completion & Reward Claim**:  
   - The first player to solve their puzzle shouts **"Whos ya mummy!"**  
   - Other players may continue solving until the hourglass runs out.  
   - When the timer ends, any remaining unsolved players are eliminated from reward phase.

5. **Movement & Jewel Collection**:  
   - Players who solved their puzzle **before** the timer ended may move their pyramid token:  
     - 1st to finish: may move up to 3 hex spaces  
     - 2nd to finish: may move up to 2 hex spaces  
     - 3rd to finish: may move up to 1 hex space  
     - 4th to finish: may move up to 1 hex space  
   - Movement can be in any direction (up, down, or stay).  
   - After moving, the player takes the **two leftmost available jewels** from the track adjacent to their new pyramid position.

6. **Failed Solvers**:  
   - Players who do not solve the puzzle before time runs out **cannot move or collect jewels**.

7. **End of Round**:  
   - Discard all used puzzle boards to a discard pile.  
   - The next player clockwise becomes the starter for the new round.  
   - That player rolls the die and flips the hourglass to begin.

8. **Second Chance Rule**:  
   - If **no player** completes their puzzle before the timer ends:  
     - Flip the hourglass again for a second attempt.  
     - If still no one finishes, discard the boards and proceed to the next round with a new starter.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Simultaneous Puzzle Solving**: All players solve individual puzzles at the same time.  
- **Tile Matching via Die Roll**: The die determines which subset of tiles (by symbol) must be used each round.  
- **Spatial Reasoning**: Players must fit polyominoes to exactly cover the white area.  
- **Race Mechanic**: Speed determines movement privilege and jewel access.  
- **Positional Advantage**: Movement allows access to different jewel tracks; players may cluster for better picks.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game lasts exactly **9 rounds**.  
- After the 9th round, the game ends immediately.  
- **Winning Condition**:  
  - The player with the **most jewels in a single color** wins.  
  - **Tiebreaker**: Compare second-highest color counts.  
  - If still tied, continue to third-highest, etc.  
  - If all counts are identical, the game is a tie.

**Example**:  
- Helga: 5 red, 1 yellow → best color = 5  
- Davros: 4 red, 4 white, 3 green, 3 orange → best color = 4  
- Tony: 0 gems → best color = 0  
→ **Helga wins**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I move my pyramid in any direction?**  
A: Yes. You may move up, down, or stay on the same space. You are not restricted to upward movement.

**Q: Can two players occupy the same hex space?**  
A: Yes. Multiple pyramids can be on the same space. Each collects jewels from their own position.

**Q: What if I finish second, but the first player failed the puzzle?**  
A: Then you are first to complete it and receive the 3-space movement.

**Q: Do I have to use the full movement allowance?**  
A: No. You may move fewer spaces than allowed (e.g., move 1 instead of 3).

**Q: What happens if a jewel track is empty?**  
A: If the two leftmost slots are empty, you collect nothing — even if you solved the puzzle and moved.

**Q: Can I look at future puzzle boards?**  
A: No. Puzzle boards must remain facedown until drawn at the start of a round.
