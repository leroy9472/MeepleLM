## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Sentient*, players represent competing tech companies racing to build the most advanced network of sentient robots. The goal is to strategically acquire and calibrate Bot cards, score points during three rounds, and attract Investors who will reward long-term success. The player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game wins.

   - 4 Agent pawns  
   - 5 Assistant markers  
   - 2 Turn Order markers (in their color)

3. Place the Turn Order board nearby.  
4. Sort Investor tokens into 3 face-down stacks by round number (1, 2, 3).

At the start of each round:  
1. Draw 4 Bot cards and place them face-up in a row (the "factory").  
2. Place 5 Investor tokens: one between each card and one on each end (total 5). Use the stack matching the current round (1, 2, or 3).  
3. Place 1 VP chip under each Investor token.  
4. Each player rolls their 5 dice and places them on matching colored spots on their player board.  
5. (For rounds 2 and 3): Return Turn Order markers from the prior round to players.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### On Your Turn: Choose One  
**A. Procure a Bot**  
1. **Place Agent**:  
   - Place 1 Agent pawn above a Bot card in the factory.  
   - Optionally place any number of Assistant markers with the Agent.  
   - Each Agent and Assistant = 1 Influence for adjacent Investors.  
2. **Take the Card**:  
   - Take the Bot card and place it in an empty slot between two dice on your player board.  
   - Replace it with a new card from the deck (shuffle discards if needed).  
3. **Calibrate Adjacent Dice**:  
   - Adjust dice based on the +/−/= icons in the card’s corners:  
     - **+**: Increase die by 1 (6 → 1)  
     - **−**: Decrease die by 1 (1 → 6)  
     - **=**: No change  
   - To **block** a +/− effect, place an Assistant on the icon.  
   - You may block both sides of a card.  
   - Assistants remain on the card until end of round.

**B. Pass/Discard Bots (Once per Round)**  
- Instead of taking a Bot, place your **free** Turn Order marker on the upcoming round’s space (on top of any existing stack).  
- **If you have at least 1 Agent remaining**:  
  - Discard all face-up Bot cards and replace with 4 new ones.  
- **If you have no Agents left**:  
  - Just place your marker; do **not** refresh the factory.  
- This action ends your round.

#### Turn Order  
- Round 1: Based on initial stack on Turn Order board.  
- Rounds 2–3: Determined by players’ Turn Order markers placed during prior round (top = first).  
- Play proceeds in stack order; repeats until all players have passed.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End of Round Scoring (After All Players Pass)  

**1. Score Cards**  
Each player scores their **4 Bot cards taken this round** based on adjacent dice. Only current-round cards are scored.  

| Bot Type       | Scoring Rules |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Information** | 2 VP if one adjacent die matches the number on card; 7 VP if both match |
| **Transport**   | Score based on die relationship:<br>• Left < Right<br>• Left ≤ Right<br>• Left = Right |
| **Industry**    | Score for combinations:<br>• Left odd, right even<br>• Sum is odd<br>• Both dice odd |
| **Military**    | Score based on:<br>• Sum ≤ 4 or ≥ 10<br>• Sum = 7<br>• Difference = 1 or 2<br>• Sum ≤ 5 or ≥ 9 |
| **Service**     | Score via formula (minimum 0):<br>• Sum − 6<br>• 8 − Sum<br>• 5 − Lower die<br>• 7 − Higher die<br>• Higher die − 2<br>• Lower die − 1 |

After scoring, place used Bot cards face-down near your board.

**2. Earn Investors**  
- For each Investor token, compare **Influence** (total Agents + Assistants) on adjacent factory slots.  
- **Winner**: Most influence → takes Investor token  
- **Second Place**: 2nd most influence → takes 1 VP chip  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Most Agents adjacent  
  2. Higher position in **current** round’s turn order stack  
- Place earned Investors above your player board.

**3. Refresh**  
- Remove all remaining factory cards, unclaimed Investors, and VP chips.  
- Return Turn Order markers from completed round to players.  
- Proceed to next round setup.

#### Final Scoring (After Round 3)  
- For **each Investor token** (including the one on your starting board):  
  - Gain **1 VP per Bot card** you own of the matching type.  
  - Example: 3 Industry Investors + 4 Industry cards = 3 × 4 = 12 VP  
- Cards with no matching Investors score **0** from those cards.  
- Add all VP chips earned during the game.  

**Winning**:  
- Highest total VP wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Most Investor tokens.  
- If still tied, shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place Assistants without an Agent?**  
  No. Assistants can only be placed when taking a Bot (alongside an Agent).  

- **Can I block both + and − on a card?**  
  Yes. Use one Assistant per icon.  

- **What happens if the deck runs out during a round?**  
  Shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.  

- **When do dice changes take effect?**  
  Immediately after placing a Bot card. Affects all subsequent plays in the round.  

- **Can I pass before taking all 4 Bots?**  
  Yes, but only once per round, and only when it’s your turn. You must still take 4 Bots before the round ends.  

- **Do I score cards immediately or at end of round?**  
  All cards are scored **simultaneously** at end of round.  

- **Are Assistants returned after each round?**  
  Yes. All Assistants on cards are returned to players during refresh.
