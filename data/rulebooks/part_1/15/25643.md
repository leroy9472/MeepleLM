## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the land of Arkadia, four wealthy families—the cloth merchants (red), spice merchants (olive), carpenters (black), and silversmiths (silver)—compete to contribute most to the construction of a grand castle. Players act as architects commissioned to develop the town and advance castle construction. The objective is to earn the most gold by collecting and selling seals from the families, with seal values determined by the visible presence of their colors on the completed castle.

2. Components  
- 1 game board featuring building zones and tent camps  
- 1 castle building lot (10-square grid for constructing the castle)  
- 28 castle pieces (7 per family color: red, olive, black, silver), each fitted with a seal tile  
- 4 player screens (yellow, orange, green, violet)  
- 16 architect banners (4 per player color)  
- 40 building cards (each showing a building type and family seal)  
- 40 buildings in 7 shapes: residential house, farm, tavern, mill, smithy, trade centre, monastery  
- 88 seals (22 per family; includes 8 high-value seals worth 5 each)  
- 44 player workers (11 per player color)  
- 24 neutral (beige) workers  
- Gold coins (values: 1, 5, 10)

3. Setup  
- Place the game board in the center. Position the castle building lot so no tent camp is covered.  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 1 screen  
  - 4 architect banners (placed on screen)  
  - 3 workers of their color (placed behind screen)  
- Remaining workers (including 24 neutral) form a general supply.  
- Castle pieces:  
  - Place 12 pieces (3 red, 3 olive, 3 black, 3 silver) on the 1st and 2nd floor pools (8 spaces total; stack 2 per space at edges).  
  - Place remaining 4 pieces (1 of each color) on the 3rd floor pool squares.  
- Sort building tiles by shape and place them next to the board.  
- Place seals and gold in general supply.  
- Shuffle building cards:  
  - Deal 4 face-down to each player.  
  - Reveal 3 face-up cards next to the board.  
  - Form a face-down draw pile with the rest.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise, starting with the youngest.  
Each turn consists of two parts:  
1. **MUST**: Perform one of the following:  
   A. Play a building card and place the matching building tile.  
   B. Introduce one or more workers.  
2. **CAN**: Optionally use one architect banner.

After the active player completes both parts, play passes left.

5. Core Mechanics  

**I. Place a Building**  
- Choose a building card from hand.  
- Take the corresponding building tile and place it on the board such that it is:  
  - Orthogonally adjacent to an existing building, the castle lot, or any worker (any color).  
- The tile must cover only vacant squares (no overlap with buildings or workers).  
- Place a seal of the color shown on the card on the building.  
- Discard the played card.  
- Draw a replacement card: choose one of the 3 face-up cards or the top of the draw pile.  
  - If a face-up card is taken, immediately replace it with the top card from the draw pile.  
- If the building covers one or more tent camp squares, take 1 neutral worker per tent camp covered and add to your supply.

**II. Introduce Workers**  
- Choose any existing building on the board.  
- Place any number of your own or neutral workers from your supply onto vacant squares orthogonally adjacent to that building.  
- All placed workers must be adjacent to the same building.  
- Workers remain in place for the rest of the game.  
- Placing a worker on a tent camp does not grant additional neutral workers.

**Building Completion**  
A building is completed when all orthogonally adjacent squares are occupied (by workers, buildings, or board edges).  
Completion can be triggered by:  
- Placing a new building  
- Introducing workers  

**Payout**  
When a building is completed:  
- Each player receives 1 seal (of the color on the building) for each of their own workers adjacent to it.  
- The active player receives an additional seal of that color (the one from the building).  
- Neutral workers do not generate seals.  
- If multiple buildings are completed simultaneously, resolve each payout individually.  
- Seals are kept hidden behind player screens.

**Castle Construction**  
After payout, the active player places one castle piece per newly completed building on the castle building lot:  
- Use pieces from the 1st floor pool until all 10 squares are filled.  
- Once 1st floor is complete, move remaining 2 pieces from 1st floor pool to 3rd floor pool.  
- Begin placing 2nd floor pieces from their pool.  
- When 2nd floor is complete, move its remaining 2 pieces to 3rd floor pool.  
- Castle pieces may be placed on any vacant square of the current floor.

**III. Use Architect Banner (Optional)**  
At the end of their turn, a player may use one of their 4 architect banners:  
- Remove the banner from the game.  
- Take 2 workers of their color from the general supply.  
- Optionally, exchange any number of their seals for gold:  
  - Value of a seal = number of visible castle squares of that color (bird’s-eye view).  
  - Return exchanged seals to the general supply.  
- Players may use up to 4 banners (and thus up to 4 evaluations) during the game.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when the last piece of the 2nd floor is placed.  
  - Immediately move the remaining 2 pieces from the 2nd floor pool to the 3rd floor pool.  
  - The current player finishes their turn normally (may use a banner).  
- Then, each other player takes one final turn (total of one extra round).  
  - During this round, completed buildings use pieces from the 3rd floor pool for castle construction.  
- After the final round:  
  - All players evaluate remaining seals at current castle values (same method as banner use).  
- The player with the most gold wins.  
- In case of a tie, all tied players win.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a building diagonally adjacent to another building or worker?**  
  No. Placement requires orthogonal (horizontal/vertical) adjacency.

- **Can I place workers adjacent to multiple buildings?**  
  Yes, but all workers introduced in a single turn must be adjacent to the same building.

- **What happens if I complete multiple buildings in one action?**  
  Resolve each completion separately: payout and castle piece placement for each.

- **Can I use a banner without selling seals?**  
  Yes. You may use a banner solely to gain 2 workers.

- **What if the seal supply runs out?**  
  Players may exchange 5 standard seals for one high-value seal (worth 5). This helps manage large quantities.

- **Can I place a building that immediately completes itself?**  
  Yes. Normal payout and castle construction apply.

- **Do neutral workers contribute to building completion?**  
  Yes, they occupy space and help complete buildings, but do not earn seals for any player.
