### 1. Lore & Objective
Java is a strategy board game set on the island of Java, where players take on the roles of Javanese rulers competing to develop central Java’s fertile but undeveloped regions. Players expand villages into cities by building palaces, cultivating rice fields, creating irrigation systems, and hosting palace festivals to earn fame points (VPs). The goal is to amass the most fame points through development and final control of cities. The game ends when the last 3-space land tile is placed, followed by a final scoring round.

### 2. Components
- 1 game board (150 land spaces in central Java + 3 irrigation spaces)
- 56 × 3-space land tiles (2 rice + 1 village/city)
- 20 × 2-space land tiles (1 rice + 1 village/city)
- 12 × 1-space rice field tiles
- 8 × 1-space village/city tiles
- 40 palace tiles (values: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 – in quantities 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 respectively)
- 16 irrigation tiles
- 30 palace (festival) cards
- 48 developers (12 per player in 4 colors)
- 12 extra action tokens (3 per player)
- 4 scoring markers
- 4 action summary cards

### 3. Setup
- Place the board in the center.
- Each player takes:
  - 12 developers
  - 3 extra action tokens
  - 5 two-space land tiles
  - 3 one-space rice tiles
  - 2 one-space village tiles
  - 3 face-down palace cards
  - 1 action summary card
- Place remaining 3-space land tiles and irrigation tiles in supply.
- Sort palace tiles by value into 5 face-up stacks (dancer side down).
- Shuffle palace cards into a deck; reveal the top card as the festival card.
- Place scoring markers at 0 on the track.
- Unused components are returned to the box for <4 players.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Players take turns clockwise.
- On a turn, a player uses up to 6 Action Points (AP), with at least 1 AP spent to place a land tile.
- Actions may be taken in any order, except palace festivals, which must be the final action and cost 0 AP.
- A player may use only 1 extra action token per turn, increasing their AP to 7.
- Turn ends after all actions.

#### Available Actions:
- **Place land tile (1 AP)**:
  - Must place at least one tile per turn.
  - Cannot cover palaces, developers, or irrigation.
  - Cannot merge two cities.
  - Cannot be placed directly over a tile of the same size.
  - May extend outside central Java (1 extra AP per hex outside).
- **Place irrigation tile (1 AP)**:
  - Must be placed on an empty board space at sea level (not on land tiles).
  - Immediately scores VPs if fully enclosed by land tiles.
- **Move developer**:
  - Add from border: 1 AP (lowlands), 2 AP (mountains).
  - Move within same land type: 0 AP.
  - Change land type (rice ↔ village): 1 AP.
  - Cannot move through opponent’s developer or palaces.
  - Can move through own developers and terraces freely.
  - Remove from edge: 1 AP (lowlands), 2 AP (mountains); may re-enter same turn.
- **Build or enlarge palace (1 AP)**:
  - Must have a developer in the village/city.
  - Must have highest-ranked developer(s) (by level and count).
  - Palace must be ≤ number of connected village/city spaces.
  - Only one palace per city; max value 10.
  - New palace tile is placed face-up (no dancer); covers old tile.
  - Score half the value of the new palace tile immediately.
  - Only one palace action per turn (build or enlarge, not both).
- **Draw palace card (1 AP per card)**:
  - Max 2 cards per turn.
  - Choose top face-down card or face-up festival card.
  - If festival card is taken, replace it with top card from deck.
  - Cards are kept secret.
- **Arrange palace festival (0 AP, final action only)**:
  - Must have at least one developer in a city.
  - Must have at least one matching palace card (symbol matches festival card).
  - Palace must not have held a festival (dancer side not visible).
  - Player starts bidding; others may join in clockwise order.
  - Bidding continues until one player wins or all highest bidders agree to share.
  - Winner(s) score VPs based on palace value and sharing status (see scoring).
  - All played cards are discarded.
  - Flip top palace tile to dancer side to mark festival held.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Terracing**: Land tiles can be stacked (except same size), changing terrain and enabling strategic development.
- **Developer Ranking**:
  - Highest level with most developers wins.
  - Tie? Compare next lower level, etc.
  - Unbroken tie → no palace building/enlarging.
- **Palace Festivals**:
  - Triggered by matching symbol on palace cards.
  - Bidding determines winner or shared outcome.
  - Cards are consumed.
- **Extra Action Tokens**: Spend 1 token for 7 AP instead of 6 (max 1 per turn).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game ends** when the last 3-space land tile is placed.
- The player who placed it finishes their turn, then performs **final scoring**.
- Remaining players take one **final turn** (tile placement not required), then do final scoring in clockwise order.
- After all final scorings, the player with the most fame points wins.

#### Scoring Events:
1. **Building/Enlarging Palace**:
   - Score half the value of the new palace tile immediately.
   - No points if tied for highest developer rank.
2. **Enclosing Irrigation**:
   - When irrigation area is fully surrounded by land tiles, the player with the highest-ranked developer adjacent scores 3 VPs per enclosed irrigation tile.
   - No points if tied or no adjacent developers.
3. **Palace Festival**:
   - Single winner: scores VPs from "crossed swords" column (based on palace value).
   - Shared: all tied top bidders score from "hands shaking" column.
   - See reference card for exact values.
4. **Final Scoring**:
   - For each palace:
     - **Highest rank** (or tie): score full palace value.
     - **Second highest** (or tie): score half palace value (rounded down).
     - Otherwise: 0.
   - Mark scored palaces with extra action tokens to avoid double-counting; return tokens after scoring.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a city be split?**  
  Yes. Covering city spaces with rice tiles can split a city. The remaining village section (no palace) can have a new palace built.
- **Can you have multiple festivals in one palace?**  
  Yes, but only after enlarging the palace. Each new value allows one new festival.
- **Can you move developers off the board?**  
  Yes, for 1 AP (lowlands) or 2 AP (mountains). Can re-enter same turn.
- **What if the deck runs out of palace cards?**  
  Shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.
- **Can you place a land tile partially outside central Java?**  
  Yes, if at least one hex covers central Java. Pay 1 AP per hex outside.
- **Can you score multiple palaces in one turn?**  
  Yes, if you have highest rank in multiple cities and sufficient AP.
- **Do you still score VPs after final scoring?**  
  Yes. Players who have completed final scoring can still gain VPs from festivals during others’ turns.
