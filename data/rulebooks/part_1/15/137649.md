## PART1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Team Disco, a fireteam of elite Commandos, enters Subterra Bravo—a facility overtaken by hostile alien forces known as the Ghin. Their mission is to restore power by activating the generator and then evacuate through the A-Lift. The Overseer, representing the alien forces, seeks to eliminate at least half of the Commandos before they can complete their objective.

Commando Victory: Start the generator and have more than half of the Commandos exit via the A-Lift.  
Overseer Victory: Kill at least half of the Commandos.

2. Components  
- Map tiles and passage tiles (green for Commando, red for enemy)  
- Commando figures, character sheets, stance decks, and kit decks  
- Investigate markers and Investigate cards  
- Door markers (facedown at setup)  
- Objective tokens (e.g., generator, A-Lift)  
- Adrenaline and wound tokens  
- Round tracker with primary timer token  
- Overseer Dashboard tiles (Backswing, Frenzy, Charge, Hasten, Clone Reinforcements, Surprise Attack)

- Room cards (e.g., Faulty Intel, Recon Patrol, Clear, Flanking Party, Fire Team, Objective A-Lift)  
- Move tokens (blue/red) for Commandos

3. Setup  
- Build the map according to the mission diagram.  
- Place green Commando passage tile and investigate markers as indicated.  
- Do not place enemy passages A, B, or C at start; they are triggered by events.  
- Place door markers facedown on all door locations as shown on the map.  
- Create Room Stacks and place them in specified rooms:
  - Room (10A/11A/12A): Faulty Intel, Recon Patrol, Vanguard  
  - Corridor room: Flanking Party, Fire Team, Clear  
  - Room 2A: Flanking Party, Fire Team, Clear  
  - Room 1B: Vanguard, Recon Patrol, Objective A-Lift  
- Set up Overseer Dashboard with: Backswing, Frenzy, Charge, Hasten, Clone Reinforcements, Surprise Attack  
- Energy Pool Minimum: 2 × number of Commandos  
- Place Commandos at starting positions per mission.  
- Shuffle Investigate deck and place near the map.  
- Place primary timer token on round 1.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in four phases:

1. **Timer Phase**  
   - Move timer token forward one space.  
   - Resolve events:
     - Round 3: Overseer places either enemy passage A or B.  
     - Round 5: Overseer places the remaining passage (A or B).  
     - Crisis Point Trigger: Begins at start of turn 10 OR when generator starts (whichever comes first).  
       - Overseer spawns a Fearhunter at passage A or B for free.  
       - All Clones gain Speed 7 and +1 black die on all attacks.

2. **Commando Planning Phase**  
   - Transfer all Commando adrenaline tokens to the Overseer’s energy pool.  
   - If pool is below minimum, add tokens from the bank.  
   - Commanding Officer (highest-ranking active Commando) assigns initiative cards.  
   - Each Commando selects a stance card (downed Commandos use Downed card).

3. **Commando Activation Phase**  
   - Commandos take turns in initiative order.  
   - Actions cost adrenaline (cannot exceed Max Adrenaline of current stance):
     - Investigate (1): Draw an Investigate card if on/adjacent to marker. Discard marker.  
     - Move (1): Spend 1 adrenaline per move action. Can combine moves. Flip move tokens (blue → red). After all 3 flipped, each move costs +1 adrenaline.  
     - Open Door (1): Attempt challenge if on/adjacent. If successful, reveal room and resolve Room Stack. Discard door marker.  
     - Trade (1): Pass a trade-able kit card to adjacent active Commando.  
     - Attack (2): Declare weapon and target in LOS. Roll attack dice.  
     - Revive (2): Adjacent active Commando revives downed ally. Ally recovers but keeps Downed stance until next Planning Phase.  
     - Heal (2): Discard 1 wound token.  
   - Kit cards may be used during a Commando’s turn or as interrupts.

4. **Overseer Phase**  
   - **Refresh Dashboard**: Remove adrenaline from each tile equal to its refresh rate (return to bank).  
   - **Spawn Enemies**: Pay ready cost to activate spawn ability. Place enemies per rules (e.g., adjacent to vent or passage).  
     - Clone Reinforcements: Spawn Clones; limited by number of Commandos.  
     - If ability is committed (has tokens), pay higher committed cost (to bank).  
   - **Activate Enemies**: Pay cost to activate each enemy once:
     - Move (1 adrenaline): Move up to Speed. Clones on vents can teleport to other vents (1 MP per tile).  
     - Combat (per stat card): Move + attack.  
     - Bonuses:
       - If attacking Commando at or above Max Adrenaline, add 1 red die to melee attack.  
       - If same Clone type already attacked target this phase, add 1 black die (non-cumulative).  
   - **Discard Adrenaline**: Reduce energy pool to 15 if over limit.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Stat Challenges**: Roll black dice equal to stat (e.g., Intelligence). Need hits ≥ target number. Can boost once (+1 adrenaline, +1 die).  
- **Finding the Generator**: When Commandos explore room 2A, Overseer places objective token.  
- **Starting the Generator**:
  1. Adjacent Commando spends +1 adrenaline to attempt 2 Intelligence challenge.  
  2. If successful, spend +2 adrenaline to attempt 3 Strength challenge.  
  3. On success, remove token. Power activates.  
- **Generator Started Effects**:
  - Place secondary timer on enemy passage C.  
  - Remove any enemies on passage C.  
  - Overseer cannot spawn from C while timer is present.  
  - To remove timer, Overseer pays 8 adrenaline (can be split over turns; track beside passage).  
- **Line of Sight (LOS)**:
  - Draw two lines from attacker’s front corners to target’s corners.  
  - LOS blocked if line passes through wall, door art, or between wall and door.  
  - EMI: If attacker or target on EMI tile, remove 1 black die (or red if none). If 4+ EMI spaces in path, LOS blocked.  
  - Cover: If line from wall-adjacent corner of target to attacker passes through wall, +1 Ranged Defense.  
- **Movement**:
  - Only 1 diagonal per turn.  
  - Cannot end in same space as another figure.  
  - Rubble: Spend +1 MP to exit.  
  - Vents: Clones can move between vent spaces (cost 1 MP per tile).  
- **Downed Status**:
  - Triggered when wounds = Vitality.  
  - Replace figure with downed marker.  
  - Transfer adrenaline to Overseer.  
  - All dashboard abilities refresh once.  
  - Can only move and trade.  
  - Cannot be attacked until Crisis Point. If attacked and hit, killed.  
  - Revive: Adjacent Commando spends 2 adrenaline. Downed Commando recovers; removes 1 wound at next Planning Phase.  
- **Crisis Point**:
  - Triggered at start of turn 10 or when generator starts (whichever first).  
  - Overseer spawns Fearhunter for free at A or B.  
  - All Clones gain Speed 7 and +1 black die on attacks.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Commando Win**: Generator started AND more than half of Commandos exit via A-Lift.  
  - To exit: Move into A-Lift tile. Remove from map.  
- **Overseer Win**: At least half of Commandos are killed (downed Commandos killed post-Crisis Point).  
- Game ends immediately when either condition is met.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases

  Passage C remains blocked until paid.

  Yes, all flipped back to blue during Timer Phase.
