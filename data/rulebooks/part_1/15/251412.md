## On Tour — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   You are the manager of a band going on a 100-day tour across the United States (or Europe). The goal is to plan a continuous tour route that visits as many states (or countries) as possible, scoring points for each visited location and bonus points for circled numbers or stars on the route.

2. **Components**  
   - 8 double-sided player maps (USA / Europe)  
   - 41 USA state cards  
   - 39 Europe country cards  
   - 2 ten-sided dice  
   - 8 dry erase markers  
   - Rulebook  

3. **Setup**  
   1. Give each player a player board and a dry erase marker.  
   2. Shuffle the appropriate deck (USA or Europe) and place it in the center.  
   3. Roll both dice. Re-roll if doubles are rolled (setup only).  
   4. Combine the two digits into two different 2-digit numbers (e.g., 1 and 4 → 14 and 41).  
   5. Draw a card; all players write the lower number in the state shown on the card.  
   6. Draw another card; all players write the higher number in the state shown on that card.  
   7. Circle both numbers.  
   8. Repeat steps 3–7 once more (total of four numbers placed).  
   9. Remove the four used cards from the game (do not return to deck).  
   10. The player with the best music taste (determined by group) goes first.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   On each turn, in order:  
   1. **Flip 3 Cards**: The active player draws and reveals 3 cards.  
   2. **Roll Dice**: The active player rolls both dice.  
   3. **Combine Results**: Form two different 2-digit numbers from the dice (e.g., 5 and 6 → 56 and 65).  
   4. **Write Numbers**: All players simultaneously write one number in each of two empty states, following placement rules.  
   5. **Star Powers (if triggered)**: Instead of writing numbers, draw one star in an empty state in the correct region if:  
      - All three revealed cards show the same region, OR  
      - Doubles are rolled.  
   6. **Discard & Pass**: Discard the 3 revealed cards and pass the dice clockwise.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Where to Write Numbers**:  
     - Players must use two of the three revealed cards (one per number).  
     - Each number must be written in a state within the region shown on its corresponding card.  
     - If a number is written in the exact state shown on a card, it must be circled.  
     - Each card can only be used once per turn.  
   - **Star Placement**:  
     - When a star is drawn, it must be placed in an empty state within the region shown on one of the three cards.  
     - If the star is placed in a state matching one of the three cards exactly, it may be circled.  
   - **Last Turn**:  
     - When only one or two empty states remain, skip flipping cards.  
     - Roll the dice and write the two numbers in any remaining empty states, following normal rules (using any region, but still requiring one number per state).  
     - If doubles are rolled and only one state remains, the player may place a star instead, then get one additional turn.  
   - **Illegal Moves**:  
     - If a player cannot legally place a number, they mark an X in any empty state of their choice.  
     - X’s block the route during scoring.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - The game ends when all states are filled.  
   - **Draw Route**:  
     - Begin in any state.  
     - Draw a continuous line through adjacent states.  
     - Each next state must have a number **equal to or greater than** the previous one.  
     - Stars are wild and count as any number.  
     - No revisiting states.  
     - Route cannot pass through X’s.  
   - **Scoring**:  
     - 1 point per visited state.  
     - 1 bonus point per circled number or circled star on the route.  
   - Highest total score wins.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Q: What if doubles are rolled on the last turn with two states left?**  
     A: Players may place a star in one of the two remaining states, then take one more final turn.  
   - **Q: Can I place both numbers in the same region?**  
     A: Yes, as long as each number uses a different card and the region on that card matches the placement.  
   - **Q: Can I place a number in a state not on any of the three cards?**  
     A: Yes, as long as it’s in a region shown on one of the two cards you’re using.  
   - **Q: Can I skip placing a number if I don’t like the options?**  
     A: No, but if no legal placement exists, mark an X in any empty state.  
   - **Q: Can my route move from a number to an equal number?**  
     A: Yes. Equal numbers are allowed.  
   - **Q: Can I use the same card for both numbers?**  
     A: No. Each of the three cards can be used only once per turn.
