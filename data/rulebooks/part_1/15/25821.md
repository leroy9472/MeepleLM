## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In the village of Millers Hollow, a dark presence lurks among the townspeople—werewolves. By night, they prey on innocent villagers. By day, suspicion runs rampant as the survivors debate who to trust. Hidden roles, secret alliances, and special abilities determine the fate of the village.

**Win Conditions:**
- **Villagers** win when all werewolves are eliminated.
- **Werewolves** win when they equal or outnumber the living villagers.
- **Lovers** win only if they are the last two survivors, regardless of alignment.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
**Each game cycle alternates between Night and Day.**

#### First Night Sequence:
1. **Thief**: Wakes up, views the two set-aside cards, and may swap their card with one of them.
2. **Cupid**: Wakes up, selects two players to become Lovers. Storyteller taps them to confirm. They wake up, recognize each other, then return to sleep.
3. **Lovers**: Briefly wake to identify each other.

#### Subsequent Nights:
1. **Seer**: Chooses one player. Storyteller shows the Seer that player’s role.
2. **Werewolves**: Open eyes, silently agree on a victim, then return to sleep.
3. **Witch**: Is informed of the werewolves’ target. May use:
   - Healing Potion: Save the targeted player (only once per game).
   - Poison Potion: Kill any player (only once per game).
   - Cannot use both in one night unless house-ruled.

#### Daytime:
1. Storyteller announces the result of the night:
   - If someone was killed and not saved, they are eliminated and reveal their card.
   - If the Witch used poison, that player is also revealed.
2. The dead player uses any death-triggered ability (e.g., Hunter).
3. Living players debate for approximately 5 minutes.
4. Players vote to eliminate one suspect. Majority vote wins (tie = no elimination).
5. Eliminated player reveals their role and exits the game.
6. If the Captain was eliminated, they name a successor before leaving.
7. All players close their eyes. Night begins again.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Roles:
- **Villager**: No ability. Wins with villagers.
- **Werewolf**: Each night, chooses a player to eliminate. Wolves know each other. Wins when wolves ≥ villagers.
- **Seer**: Each night, may check the true role of one player.
- **Witch**: Has two one-time potions:
  - Healing: Prevents one night kill.
  - Poison: Kills one player at night.
  - Cannot heal and poison the same night unless specified.
- **Cupid**: On first night only, chooses two Lovers. If one dies, the other dies immediately.
- **Hunter**: When eliminated (by day vote or night kill), may kill one other player in return.
- **Captain**: Chosen at start by player vote. Has **two votes** during day eliminations. On death, names successor.
- **Thief**: On first night, may swap role with one of two set-aside cards. If one of the set-aside cards is a Werewolf, the Thief may become it.
- **Little Girl**: May secretly open her eyes during the werewolf phase to identify them. If caught (i.e., seen by Storyteller), she dies immediately.

#### Special Rules:
- **Lovers**: Win only if they are the final two alive. Their team overrides all others.
- **Ties in Voting**: No one is eliminated.
- **Captain Succession**: Captain may name any living player as successor.
- **Witch Limitations**: Cannot save herself with healing potion unless she knows she is targeted. Potion use is secret unless revealed.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends immediately when any of the following occur:
- All werewolves are eliminated → **Villagers win**.
- Werewolves equal or outnumber living villagers → **Werewolves win**.
- Only the two Lovers remain → **Lovers win**, even if one is a werewolf.

No formal scoring; victory is determined by team conditions.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can the Witch save herself?** Yes, if she is targeted and has the healing potion.
- **Can the Hunter kill a dead player?** No. The killed player must be alive at the time.
- **What if a Lover is the last villager and the other Lover is a werewolf?** As long as they are the last two, they win together.
- **Can the Seer check the same player twice?** Yes.
- **Does the Captain’s double vote apply during tiebreaks?** Yes, counts as two separate votes.
- **Can the Thief take a set-aside Werewolf card?** Yes.
- **What happens if the Witch uses both potions?** She has no further night actions.
- **Can the Little Girl be killed by werewolves?** Yes, like any other player. If she peeks and is caught by the Storyteller, she dies immediately.
