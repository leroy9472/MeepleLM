### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds through 7 phases:

**1. Plot Phase**

- Total initiative (plot + bonuses) determines first player; highest initiative chooses first player.
- In 3-4 player games: players select titles in clockwise order from Small Council Chamber.

**2. Draw Phase**
- All players draw 2 cards (if deck not empty).

**3. Marshalling Phase** (players act clockwise, one at a time)

  - Plays cards from hand by paying gold cost.
  - May attach duplicates to unique cards at no cost.
  - Non-house cards cost +2 gold.
  - Ends turn when no more actions desired.
- Next player becomes active player.

**4. Challenges Phase** (players act clockwise, one at a time)
- Active player may initiate one military, one intrigue, and one power challenge (any order).
- Each challenge resolves fully before the next:
  1. **Declare Attackers**: Announce challenge type and target. Kneel at least one standing character with matching challenge icon.
  2. **Declare Defenders**: Defending player kneels defenders (at least one to be considered defending).
  3. **Resolve**: 
     - Total STR compared. Attacker wins ties (if attacker has STR > 0).
     - **Military Win**: Defender kills characters equal to attacker's plot claim (any characters, not just participants).
     - **Intrigue Win**: Defender discards random cards equal to claim.
     - **Power Win**: Defender moves power from House to attacker's House.
     - **Unopposed Win**: If defender has 0 STR or no defenders, attacker gains 1 bonus power.
- Titles may modify challenge eligibility and outcomes.

**5. Dominance Phase**
- All players: add total STR of standing characters + number of gold tokens.
- Highest total wins dominance, claims 1 power.
- Tie: no power awarded.

**6. Standing Phase**
- All players stand all kneeling cards simultaneously.

**7. Taxation Phase**
- All players return unspent gold to Treasury.
- Titles returned to Small Council Chamber.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Unique Cards**
- Marked with banner icon (®).
- Only one copy of each unique card (by name) allowed in play per player.
- Cannot play unique card if already in play or in dead pile.
- Duplicates (same name) may be attached to unique card in play at no cost.
- Attached duplicate may be discarded as response to save unique card from being killed/discarded/returned.
- Duplicates are not considered attachments for game effects.

**Keywords**
- **Deadly**: If attacker controls most Deadly participants, defender must kill one participating defender after challenge.
- **Deathbound**: Card goes to dead pile instead of discard pile when leaving play.
- **Immunity**: Card ignores effects of specified card types; cannot be targeted by them.
- **Limited**: Only one Limited card (any type) may be played per round.
- **No Attachments**: No attachments may be attached to this card (duplicates allowed).

- **Setup**: May be played during setup phase.

**House-Specific Keywords**
- **Ambush**: Play from hand as Any Phase action by paying cost with influence.
- **Infamy**: Power claimed may be placed on Infamy card instead of House.
