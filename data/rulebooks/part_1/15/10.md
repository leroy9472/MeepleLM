## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Elfenland, young elves must prove their maturity by traveling across the magical land of Elfenland, visiting as many famous towns as possible. Using various forms of transportation—dragons, unicorns, giant pigs, elfcycles, troll wagons, magic clouds, ferries, and rafts—players aim to collect the most town pieces by visiting towns. The game blends route planning, hand management, and strategic use of limited transportation options. The player who visits the most towns wins; if tied, the player with the most cards in hand wins.

2. Components  
- 6 Elf Boots (player markers)  
- 6 Obstacle tiles (one per player)

4. Separate 48 Transportation Counters from 6 Obstacles (red-edged).  
5. Shuffle Transportation Counters and place face down; turn 5 face up next to pile.  
6. Each player receives:  
   - 1 Transportation Chart (shows transport legality by terrain)

7. Deal 8 Travel Cards to each player.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has 6 phases, starting with the current Starting Player and proceeding clockwise:

1. **Refill Travel Cards**  
   - Starting Player shuffles all used and discarded Travel Cards into a new deck.  
   - Deal cards so each player has exactly 8 cards in hand.

2. **Draw Secret Transportation Counter**  
   - Each player draws one face-down Transportation Counter and places it face down in front of them (kept secret).

3. **Draw Additional Transportation Counters**  
   - Beginning with Starting Player, each player draws:  
     - One face-up counter from the 5 available, or  
     - One face-down counter from the pile.  
   - Place drawn counter face up in front of them.  
   - If a face-up counter was taken, immediately replace it with a face-down one.  
   - Repeat until each player has 3 face-up counters.  
   - Players may now have up to 5 counters (1 secret + 3 face-up + 1 carried over from previous round).

4. **Plan Travel Routes (Place Transportation Counters)**  
   - Players take turns placing one of their Transportation Counters on any empty road.  
   - Counter must be legal for the terrain (use Transportation Chart).  
   - Only one counter per road.  
   - **Obstacle Option**: Instead of a counter, a player may place their Obstacle tile on a road that already has a counter.  
     - Only one Obstacle per road.  
     - Obstacles cannot be placed on rivers or lakes.  
   - Players may pass on their turn.  
   - Phase ends when all players pass consecutively.

5. **Move Elf Boots**  
   - Starting with Starting Player, each player moves their Elf Boot along roads, rivers, or lakes.  
   - Movement rules:  
     - **Roads**: Must have a Transportation Counter.  
       - Play matching Travel Card(s): 1 card if single symbol, 2 if double symbol.  
       - If Obstacle is present, play +1 additional matching card.  
       - **Caravan Rule**: Instead of required cards, play any 3 Travel Cards (including Raft).  
         - If Obstacle present, play any 4 cards.  
         - Caravans cannot be used on water.  
     - **Rivers**:  
       - Downstream (with arrow): 1 Raft card.  
       - Upstream (against arrow): 2 Raft cards.  
       - No Transportation Counter needed.  
       - Obstacles cannot be placed on rivers.  
     - **Lakes (Ferries)**:  
       - Use white-dotted ferry routes.  
       - Pay 2 Raft cards per ferry move.  
       - Obstacles cannot be placed on lakes.  
   - A player may move through multiple towns and re-use roads.  
   - When entering a town, collect one of your Town Pieces.  
   - At end of movement, discard down to 4 cards (if more than 4).  
   - Turn ends when player cannot or does not wish to play more cards.

6. **Finish the Round**  
   - Flip the top Round Card to the bottom of the stack (advance round).  
   - Pass Starting Player Card to the left.  
   - Each player keeps **one** Transportation Counter (face up or down); discard the rest.  
   - Remove all counters from the board.  
   - Shuffle all discarded and unused counters together with board counters to form new face-down pile.  
   - Turn 5 new counters face up.  
   - Remove used Obstacle tiles from the game.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Transportation Chart**: Defines which transport types can travel on which terrains.  
  - Giant Pig: cannot cross desert or mountains.  
  - Elfcycle: cannot cross desert; needs 2 cards for mountains.  
  - Magic Cloud: cannot cross desert; needs 2 cards for plains and woods.  
  - Unicorn: cannot cross plains; needs 2 cards for desert.  
  - Troll Wagon: needs 2 cards for woods, desert, mountains.  
  - Dragon: needs 2 cards for woods.  
  - Raft: only on rivers and lakes.  
- **Caravan**: Any 3 cards can substitute for required transport on roads (not water). +1 card if Obstacle.  
- **Obstacle**: Increases cost of a road by 1 matching card. Can only be placed once per player, on a road with a counter, not on water.  
- **Hand Management**: Players start with 8 cards, end turn with 4. Cards are reused each round.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after **Round 4**, OR if any player collects **all 20** of their Town Pieces **before the end of Round 3**.  
- **Winner**: Player with the most Town Pieces collected.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with the most Travel Cards in hand wins.  
- **Early Win**: A player who collects all 20 Town Pieces before Round 4 ends immediately wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I reuse a road multiple times in one turn?**  
  Yes, as long as you pay the required cards each time.  
- **Can I keep moving after collecting all my Town Pieces?**  
  Yes, but no benefit. Movement may still affect card count for tiebreaker.  
- **Can I use Caravan on rivers or lakes?**  
  No. Caravans only work on roads with Transportation Counters.  
- **What if the Travel Card deck runs out?**  
  Discards are reshuffled at the end of each round, so deck is replenished before next round.  
- **Can I place an Obstacle on a road with another player’s counter?**  
  Yes. Obstacles block all players equally.  
- **Can I save a Transportation Counter for multiple rounds?**  
  No. You keep only one counter per round; others are discarded.  
- **Do I collect a Town Piece from the starting town (Elvenhold)?**  
  No. You begin in Elvenhold, but there is no Town Piece there to collect.
