### 1. Lore & Objective
Battles of Westeros is a tactical miniatures wargame set in the world of *A Song of Ice and Fire*. Players take command of opposing Houses, leading armies into battle on hex-based terrain. The objective varies by scenario but generally involves eliminating enemy units, capturing commanders, controlling key terrain, or achieving scenario-specific victory conditions. Victory can be achieved through Victory Points, morale superiority, or Instant Win conditions such as routing the enemy.

### 2. Components
- Command Boards (one per player)
- Round Track and Round Marker
- Morale Track and Morale Marker
- Unit figures (Infantry, Ranged, Cavalry)
- Commander figures and Commander Cards (with Commit Abilities)
- Unit Reference Cards
- Leadership Cards (basic and commander-specific)
- Order Tokens (Green, Blue, Red, Valor, Morale)
- Command Tokens
- Engagement Tokens
- Status Tokens (Fire, Defend, Loot, Catapult, Brotherhood, etc.)
- Terrain Overlays and Tokens (Buildings, Forests, Rivers, Bridges, etc.)
- Combat Dice
- Gambit Cards (optional)
- Scenario-specific tokens and cards

### 3. Setup
1. **Choose Battle & House**: Select a Battle Plan and assign each player a House (e.g., Stark or Lannister).
2. **Build Command Decks**: Each player forms a Leadership deck with 10 House-specific basic Leadership Cards and 5 commander-specific cards per commander fielded, shuffled together.
3. **Place Battlefield**: Assemble terrain as specified by the Battle Plan.
4. **Deploy Commanders**: Place commander figures and their cards; place Command Tokens on Command Boards as specified.
5. **Deploy Units**: Place starting units per Battle Plan deployment rules.
6. **Set Tracks**: Place Round Marker on Round 1; set Morale Marker to center of Morale Track.
7. **Assign Momentum**: The player designated by the Battle Plan receives the Momentum Token (or starts with face-up Gambit card if using Gambit rules).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds, each with four phases:

#### 1. Rally Phase
- **Determine Advantage**: The player with more Command Tokens on their Command Board acts first. Tie goes to Momentum holder.
- **Refresh Commanders**: Move all Command Tokens from Commander Cards back to Command Boards.
- **Rally Units**: Rotate all owned unit banners to show the current Round color (black or white), making them Active.

#### 2. Marshaling Phase
- **Receive Order Tokens**: Each player rolls a number of combat dice (as specified by the Battle Plan) and gains Order Tokens matching the results.
- **Draw Leadership Cards**: Each player draws a number of Leadership Cards (as specified by the Battle Plan).

#### 3. Command Phase
Players alternate turns, starting with the player who has Advantage.
On a turn, a player may:
- **Play an Order Token**: Discard one Order Token to order one Active unit matching its color (Green, Blue, Red), or a Valor Token to order any unit. Two identical Order Tokens may be discarded to order any unit.
- **Play a Leadership Card**: Choose a Commander, pay Command Costs (move Command Tokens from Board to Commander Card), and order units within that Commander’s Zone of Control (ZoC = 2 hexes). At least one unit must be ordered. Commander-specific Tactics may be used if conditions are met.
- **Pass**: Once a player passes, they take no further actions this round. Play continues until both pass.

**Unit Orders**: Ordered units may move and/or attack. All movement must be completed before any attacks. Units become Inactive (banners flipped) after being ordered.

#### 4. Regroup Phase
1. **Resolve Status Conditions**:
   - Fire: Apply hits, spread Level 4 Fires.
   - Catapults: Fire Active Catapult Tokens.
   - Discard Defend and Loot Tokens.
   - Check Disloyal units.
   - Set Formations.
2. **Score Victory Points** (per Battle Plan).
3. **Check Victory Conditions** (including Instant Wins like Rout).
4. **Discard Excess Resources**: Keep up to 1 Order Token and 1 Leadership Card; discard the rest.
5. **Recover Morale**: If Morale Marker is in colored zone and not on a break point, move it toward center to nearest break point.
6. **Advance Round Marker**.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Unit Activation**: Units are Active when their banner shows the current Round color. Only Active units can be ordered.
- **Ordering**:
  - Via Order Token: Any Active unit on the board.
  - Via Leadership Card: Only units within a Commander’s ZoC.
- **Movement**: Units must move entire distance before attacking. Cannot move through or into occupied hexes. Terrain may restrict movement (e.g., stop when entering Forest).
- **Combat**:
  - **Melee**: Attacker must be adjacent. Place Engagement Token. Target may counterattack if Stalwart.
  - **Ranged**: Requires Line of Sight (LoS) and within range. LoS blocked by terrain and units.
  - **Hits**: Scored by matching die color to target’s rank. Valor hits all ranks unless specified. Non-Cavalry cannot hit Cavalry on Valor.
  - **Morale Results**: Cause target to retreat 1 hex per result. Cannot ignore unless Stalwart.
- **Engagement**:
  - Units with Engagement Token can only attack that unit unless they Disengage (suffer Parting Blow).
  - Flanking: Attacking an engaged enemy allows re-roll of one symbol.
- **Retreats**: Must retreat directly away from attacker (directional retreat). Cannot move through units or impassable terrain. Failure to retreat converts Morale results to hits.
- **Commander Capture**: Commander is captured when a single attack deals hits equal to or greater than their Capture Rating. Non-commander figures must be removed first unless using Targeted Shot.
- **Morale**: Affected by unit eliminations (Green: +1, Blue: +2, Red: +3) and Morale Tokens. Rout occurs if Morale Marker reaches Rout space (Instant Loss).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Conditions**:
  - **Instant Win**: Rout (Morale Marker reaches Rout space) or other scenario-specific conditions.
  - **End of Game**: After final round, player with most Victory Points wins.
  - **Tiebreaker**: Higher Morale wins. If Morale tied, Momentum holder wins.
- **Scoring**: Varies by scenario. Common sources: controlling objectives, eliminating units, capturing commanders, terrain destruction.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Simultaneous Effects**: Resolve in player order (first player resolves all their effects, then second).
- **ZoC Overlap**: Units can be in multiple ZoCs; can be ordered via any Commander’s Leadership Card if cost is paid.
- **Tactics Timing**: Resolve Before/After Command as specified; conditions checked when card is played.
- **Brotherhood Without Banners**: Use Brotherhood Tokens to keep units Active. Spend 1 token per turn if Brotherhood units are ordered. Rallying replenishes tokens.
- **Catapults**: Fire during Regroup Phase before other status effects. Range measured from edge of board.
- **Fire**: Units in Fire hex cannot move or attack. Take 1 hit per Fire Level during Regroup. Can fight Fire by spending turn.
- **Disloyal Units**: Roll dice based on Morale level; remove figures on matching color or Morale results.
- **Withdrawals**: Optional retreat after enemy movement; costs Morale based on rank comparison.
