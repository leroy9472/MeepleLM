# PELOPONNES — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In 1000 B.C., players represent Peloponnesian civilizations striving to build powerful empires through land expansion and prestigious constructions. The goal is to balance population and prestige over 8 rounds (or 9 with the Hellas Expansion) to achieve the highest final score and emerge as the most influential civilization.

Victory is determined by balancing population and prestige: your final score is the **lower** of your Prestige Points or Population Points. The player with the highest final score wins.

### 3. Setup
1. Each player:
   - Takes a Player Mat and 5 markers (set to "0" for wood, stone, food, population, luxury goods).
   - Takes 2 colored chits (one for bidding, one for turn order).
2. Randomly deal one **Civilization Tile** per player; place it centered above the Player Mat. Return extras to the box.
3. Each player gains:
   - Starting resources, population, and coins as shown in the upper-right box of their Civilization Tile.
4. Determine starting player order:
   - Players are ordered by the red number in the lower-left of their Civilization Tile (ascending).
   - Place colored chits in order to the right of the Arrow Chit.
5. Prepare tile decks:
   - Sort Building and Land Tiles by letter (A, B, C, D if used), shuffle each, and form face-down stacks.
6. Place **Conquest Tile** in the center (not used in 5+ player games).
7. Lay out **Disaster Tiles**; mix Disaster Chits face-down nearby.
8. **Optional Expansions**:
   - **Sea Expansion**: Reveal as many Sea Tiles as players; remove rest.
   - **Trade Expansion**: Shuffle Trade Tiles; reveal the top one.
   - **Goat Expansion**: Each player places a Goat Chit on "0" of food track; place food marker on top.

### 4. Gameplay Flow (8 Rounds)
Each round follows this sequence:

#### 1. Reveal Tiles
- Reveal **# of players** tiles from the current stack (A → B → C → D if used).
- Add tiles to the **Conquest Row** until **5 total** are face-up (or 6 with 6 players).
- **Exception**: 5+ players → no Conquest Row.
- If a **Supply Round** tile is revealed, immediately pause for a Supply Round (see below), then continue.

#### 2. Bidding
- In turn order, each player may:
  - **Bid**: Place coins + bid chit under a tile. Bid ≥ minimum cost.
  - **Conquest Row**: Costs +3 coins; first bid wins (cannot be outbid).
  - **Pass**: Gain 3 coins from bank.
- **Outbidding**:
  - If outbid, player must:
    - Move bid to another valid tile (bid amount unchanged), or
    - Withdraw bid: take back coins + 1 extra coin from bank (cannot bid again this round).
- **Luxury Goods**: Can be used 2:1 for coins (bids) or resources (building costs) if insufficient available.

#### 3. Adjust Player Turn Order
- Reorder players by bid amount (highest → lowest).
- Ties: maintain previous relative order.
- Passing or withdrawing = lowest bid.
- Place bid chits in new order beside Arrow Chit.

#### 4. Add Tiles to Civilization
- All bids go to bank; players retrieve bid chits.
- **Building Tile**:
  - Place to the **left** of Civilization Tile.
  - Pay resource cost (top-left) → adjust markers.
  - If unable/unwilling: place **1 coin** on tile (incomplete).
  - If cannot pay or place coin → tile removed.
  - Benefits (population, income) apply immediately.
- **Land Tile**:
  - Place to the **right** of Civilization or last Land Tile.
  - Must share **at least one resource** (wood, stone, food) with adjacent tile.
  - First Land Tile: no adjacency requirement.
  - If cannot place → tile removed.
- **Sea Tile (Expansion)**:
  - Purchased **before bidding**, one per player per round.
  - Pay full cost (resources or coins); no coin placement.
  - Place above land row.
  - Provides 1 food per tile during Supply Rounds.

#### 5. Increase Population & One-Time Income
- Gain benefits from **upper-right box** of newly acquired tile:
  - Population, resources, or coins (one-time).
- Applies even if Building is incomplete (marked with coin).

#### 6. Earn Income for the Round
- For each tile in civilization, gain income from **lower-right box**:
  - Resources, population, or coins.
- **Coin Income**: Based on current population (per Player Mat chart).
- **Excess Resources**:
  - Wood/Stone >10, Food >13 → convert excess to **Luxury Goods** (1:1).
- **Luxury Goods Income**: Players with ≥14 population gain Luxury Goods as income.

#### 7. Reveal Disaster Chits
- Reveal **2 chits**, one at a time.
- Place next to matching Disaster Tile.
- **Blank chit**: Return to box.
- **Third chit of a type revealed → Disaster triggers immediately**:
  - **Earthquake**: Pay 1 wood + 1 stone per Building (incl. incomplete). Fail → remove uncovered buildings.
  - **Drought**: Lose 1/3 food (round up).
  - **Plague**: Lose 1/3 population (round up).
  - **Tempest**: Pay 1 food + 1 coin per Land Tile. Fail → remove uncovered land tiles.
  - **Decline**: Lose 10 Luxury Goods (or all if <10).
- **Disaster Immunity**: Certain buildings (e.g., Cyclopean Masonry, Temple of Apollo) protect owner.

#### Supply Round (Triggered)
Occurs when:
- A Supply Round tile is revealed.
- Final round ends.

All players:
- **Feed Population**: 1 food per person. If insufficient, reduce population to match food.
- **Complete Buildings**: Pay resource cost for all incomplete (coin-marked) Building Tiles.
  - If unable/unwilling → remove tile.
  - Return coin to player in either case.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Luxury Goods**:
  - Gained from overproduction or ≥14 population.
  - Can substitute 2:1 for resources (building/feeding) or coins (bidding/incomplete buildings) **only when insufficient**.
- **Turn Order**: Determined by bid amount each round.
- **Incomplete Buildings**: Marked with coin; must be paid in next Supply Round or removed.
- **Tile Placement Rules**:
  - **Barracks**, **Stockade**, **Thebes Civilization Tile**: Ignore Land Tile adjacency rules.
- **Special Buildings**:
  - **Port / Temple of Apollo**: Choose 1 resource (wood, stone, food, coin) each round.
  - **Market / Agora**: Bid is worth +½ coin (allows tie-bidding), but ignored in turn order.
  - **Store**: Immune to final feeding requirement.
  - **Field of Goats**: Immune to Decline.
- **Goat Expansion**:
  - Goats tracked on food track (max 13).
  - When acquiring a tile with a goat icon → **must exchange all goats 1:1** for resources/coins after income phase.
- **Trade Expansion**:
  - Last player in turn order may use Trade Tile exchange (e.g., wood → food) as many times as desired.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends after last tile from final stack is placed and final two Disaster Chits are revealed.
- Trigger **Final Supply Round**:
  - Feed population.
  - Complete or remove incomplete buildings.

**Final Score**:
- **Prestige Points** = Sum of all tile prestige values + 1 point per 3 coins (round down).
- **Population Points** = 3 × current population.
- **Final Score** = **lower** of Prestige or Population Points.

**Winning**:
- Highest final score wins.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Higher value between Prestige or Population.
  2. Most Luxury Goods.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Outbidding**:
  - Cannot move bid to a tile if bid < minimum (even with +½ bonus).
  - Can move to Conquest Row if bid ≥ (minimum + 3).
- **Withdrawing Bid**: Counts as a pass for turn order.
- **Removing Land Tiles**: Placement rules ignored; remaining tiles slide together.
- **Luxury Goods Use**: Can be used for disaster payments (2:1).
- **Incomplete Buildings**: Only payment window is during Supply Round.
- **+½ Coin Bonuses (Market/Agora)**: Stack if multiple owned; only affect bidding, not turn order.
- **Sea Tiles**: Immune to disasters; provide 1 food each during feeding.
- **Aid of Athens (Expansion)**: Take tile, pay cost if building, gain chit. Next turn, must pass (still gain 3 coins). Holder goes last in turn order.
