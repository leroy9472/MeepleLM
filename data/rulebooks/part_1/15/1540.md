## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Battleclix is a tactical combat game set in the BattleTech universe, simulating company-level engagements during the Fourth Succession War and adjacent eras, including the Clan Invasion. Players assume the role of company commanders (typically Captains) leading a force of twelve BattleMechs (a Company). The game emphasizes command of Lances and Companies rather than individual Mechs, abstracting mechanics to allow large-scale battles in reduced playtime. Victory is achieved through tactical destruction of enemy units and control of objectives.

2. Components  
- Miniature BattleMechs mounted on Heroclix/MageKnight-style click dials  
- Hex grid game map  
- Dice (3d6 standard, optional d20s for solo play)  
- Heat chits (markers)  
- Objective counters  
- Pente stones or action markers (to track activated Mechs)  
- Optional: Vehicle and Infantry units  

3. Setup  
- Each player fields a Company of 12 Mechs totaling 600 tons.  
- The battlefield is set up with one or two Objective "Diamonds" depending on force size:  
  - One Diamond for 1–2 Companies per side  
  - Two Diamonds (side by side) for 3–4 Companies  
- Objective counters are placed on designated hexes forming the Diamond pattern.  
- Mechs are deployed on respective sides' edges (exact deployment zones may vary by scenario).  
- All Mechs begin with default dial settings and no Heat chits unless otherwise specified.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Determine Initiative:  
   - After each turn, Victory Points (VP) are tallied.  
   - The side with more VPs gains Initiative and acts first next turn.  
   - If VPs are tied, roll a d6; highest roller takes Initiative.  
2. Activation Phase:  
   - Starting with the side that has Initiative, players alternate activating one Mech at a time.  
   - Each activated Mech may take up to four actions:  
     - Move (up to two Move actions)  
     - Long Range Attack (one action)  
     - Short Range Attack (one action)  
   - Move actions must precede combat actions.  
   - After completing actions, mark the Mech as activated.  
3. End of Turn:  
   - Check VP totals.  
   - Determine Initiative for next turn.  
   - Game ends immediately if either side reaches the Break Point.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Actions & Heat**:  
  - Each action generates heat. Heat effects depend on number of actions taken and current Heat status:  
    - 0 actions: Remove Heat chit (if present)  
    - 1 action: No effect if no Heat chit; if Heat chit present, it remains  
    - 2+ actions: Receive a Heat chit; if already has one, take 1 click of damage  
  - Terrain & Abilities that Reduce Heat:  
    - Mechs in deep water: treated as having taken one fewer action for heat purposes  
    - Extra Heat Sinks (special ability): same effect  
    - These effects are cumulative (e.g., Mech with Extra Heat Sinks in water: treated as two fewer actions)  

- **Ranges & Attack Values**:  
  - Short Range: 1–5 hexes → use Short Range Value  
  - Long Range: 6 to Maximum Range → use Long Range Value  
  - Maximum Range: printed value (5, 10, 15, or 10/15)  
  - Special: Limited LRMs or Minor LRMs allow 1 or 2 damage at 11–15 hexes beyond normal max  

- **To-Hit Mechanics**:  
  - Base to-hit number: 8+ on 3d6  
  - Modifiers:  
    - Target Defense Value: + per point  
    - Target Movement/Jump Jets: +1  
    - Range: +2 for 11–15 hexes  
    - Cover:  
      - Soft Cover (e.g., woods): +1  
      - Hard Cover: +1 (partially obscured), +2 (less than half visible)  
    - Indirect Fire: bypasses Hard Cover but not Soft Cover  
  - Critical Results:  
    - Roll 3–4: Critical Miss — automatic miss, attacker takes 1 click damage  
    - Roll 17–18: Critical Hit — automatic hit, +1 damage, ignores Armored/Heavily Armored  

- **Special Effects (Colored Boxes)**:  
  - Appear on any of the four stats (Long, Short, Defense, Movement)  
  - Color indicates type of ability; same color means different effect per stat  
  - Red abilities are "Events" — negative effects triggered after taking damage  
    - Check immediately if Red appears post-damage  
    - Roll die: 5+ triggers effect (e.g., Immobilized, Ammunition Explodes)  
    - Ammunition Shortage: occurs when using affected value next time  

- **Terrain**:  
  - **Movement**:  
    - Blocking: cannot enter  
    - Slowing: costs 2 movement per hex  
    - Clear: no penalty  
    - Jump-capable Mechs: may jump over Blocking terrain up to their Movement value in height; for each inch over, lose 1 hex of movement  
  - **Combat**:  
    - Hard Cover: +1 or +2 to-hit modifier  
    - Soft Cover (e.g., forests): +1 to-hit modifier if target is within it; LOS blocked beyond 2 hexes of Soft Cover  
    - Water: provides Soft Cover; waist-deep assumed  
    - Buildings: Blocking and Hard Cover for Mechs  

- **Line of Sight (LOS) & Indirect Fire**:  
  - Normal attacks require LOS  
  - Indirect Fire (Blue Long Range): allows firing without LOS; no Hard Cover modifiers apply  
  - Can choose to fire Indirect even with LOS to avoid cover penalties (but damage reduced by 1)  

- **Hand-to-Hand Combat**:  
  - Triggered when Mechs are adjacent at start of activation  
  - Restrictions:  
    - Cannot take Long Range action  
    - Must attempt skill check (4+ on d6) to move away:  
      - +1 if Veteran, -1 if Green, +1 if Jump-capable  
    - If still adjacent, Short Range action must be Hand-to-Hand  
  - Hand-to-Hand Damage:  
    - Minimum: 1 for Light/Medium, 2 for Heavy/Assault  
    - Applies even if Short Range Value is 0  
  - Cover does not apply (except Infantry in Buildings: +2 even in HtH)  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory Points (VP)**:  
  - **Unit Destruction**:  
    - Light Mech (20–35 tons): 1 VP  
    - Medium (40–55 tons): 2 VP  
    - Heavy (60–75 tons): 3 VP  
    - Assault (80–100 tons): 4 VP  
    - Veteran Pilot: +1 VP  
    - Company Commander: +2 VP  
  - **Objective Control**:  
    - Each Objective Counter controlled: 5 VP  
    - Control: unit within 6 hexes of Objective  
    - Contested: both sides have units within 6 hexes  
    - Changes immediately when proximity shifts  

- **Break Point**:  
  - One Diamond: 32 VP  
  - Two Diamonds: 74 VP  
- **End Game**:  
  - Game ends immediately when one side reaches Break Point  
  - Winner: side that reaches Break Point first  
  - Draw: both reach Break Point simultaneously (both forces too damaged)  
  - If Break Point not reached, Initiative determined by VP total for next turn  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a Mech attack after failing to move away in HtH?**  
  Yes — failing to move still consumes a Move action, and if still adjacent, must make Hand-to-Hand attack.  
- **Does Indirect Fire work through mountains?**  
  Yes — as long as the special ability is present, no LOS required.  
- **Do Heat reductions stack?**  
  Yes — water and Extra Heat Sinks combine (treated as two fewer actions).  
- **What happens if a Red Event triggers and causes more Red values?**  
  Recheck all Red abilities immediately after each effect resolves (e.g., ammo explosion may reveal another Red, requiring new roll).  
- **Can Vehicles/Infantry earn VP?**  
  Vehicles: only if >25% of side’s total tonnage  
  Infantry: never give VP when destroyed  
- **Can a Mech attack two different enemies in one turn?**  
  Only if not engaged in Hand-to-Hand and has actions available. Clan units restricted — must finish one target before switching.
