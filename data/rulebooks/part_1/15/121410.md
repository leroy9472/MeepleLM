## STEAMARK – Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the town of Roboburg, robots work year-round in steam-powered factories and eagerly anticipate the annual six-day fair. During this time, traveling carnivals set up amusement parks to entertain the citizens and earn as much money as possible. You are the owner of one such park. Your goal is to build rides, attract visitors, manage dirt production, and expand your park to earn the most money over six turns. The player with the most money at the end wins—provided they don’t exceed environmental limits.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 6 turns. Each turn has 4 phases:

2. **Dirt Phase** – Players gain Dirt based on dice and Visitors; apply Turn Order bonuses.  
3. **Actions Phase** – Players take actions in Turn Order, spending dice.  
4. **Income Phase** – Players earn money and refill Bonus Cards.  

5. Core Mechanics  
**Dice & Pig Board**  
- Each player has 6 dice.  
- Players roll simultaneously, reroll any unsecured dice, and lock results on their Pig Board.  
- Once all dice are secured, players take Turn Order Tokens in order of completion.  
- Last player gets up to 3 final rerolls.  

**Turn Order Tokens**  
- 1st: Discard 4 Dirt  
- 2nd: Discard 2 Dirt  
- 3rd: No effect  
- 4th (Last): Gain 2 Dirt  

**Actions (Each can be taken once per turn)**  
- **Build Rides**: Cost = number of Visitor spaces (1–3).  
  - Cannot build two Rides of the same size per turn.  
  - Rides occupy 1 (Small), 2 (Medium), or 3 (Big) grid squares.  
  - Rides of different colors must not touch (not even diagonally).  
  - Rides of same color must be connected by side (not corner).  
- **Build Stands**: Cost = 1 per Stand.  
  - Cannot build two Stands of the same type per turn.  
  - Stands must not touch other Stands or Rides unless same type and connected.  
- **Attract Visitors**: Spend 1 per Visitor.  
  - Take 1 Visitor from pool, place it in the Bag.  
  - Draw same number from Bag.  
  - For each drawn Visitor, place on a Ride of matching color with space.  
  - Unplaceable Visitors return to pool.  
  - Bag must always contain exactly 6 Visitors after action.  
- **Clean Dirt**: Spend 1 to discard up to 2 Dirt tokens.  
- **Play Bonus Cards**: Spend 1 per card.  
  - Earn money as specified.  
  - Cannot play duplicate cards in one turn.  
- **Expand Park**: Spend any non-blank die to add 1 Additional Ground Tile.  
  - Max 2 per turn.  
  - New tile must connect on two adjacent sides to existing ground.  
  - Acts as regular park space afterward.  

**Stand Abilities**  
- **Security**: Return up to 1 drawn Visitor to Bag and draw again per Security Stand.  
- **Info Point**: Place a drawn Visitor on any Ride (regardless of color). Return it to pool at end of Income Phase.  
- **Casino**: Change 1 die result to any value per Casino.  
- **Toilet**: Count 1 result as 2 (per Toilet).  
- **Promotion**: Count 1 result as 2 (per Promotion).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after 6 turns.  
- **Cleanup Cost**: Count Dirt tokens. Use Final Dirt Track to determine cost.  
  - 30+ Dirt: Lose all money and lose game.  
- **Final Score** = Money + Bonus Card earnings.  
- **Winner**: Highest money after cleanup.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. More Visitors in Park  
  2. First to touch Cranio Creations logo on box  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Tie for Turn Order**: If players reach for same token simultaneously, resolve randomly or via agreed method (e.g., rock-paper-scissors).  
- **Dice Accidentally Moved**: Once on Pig Board, dice cannot be touched. Accidental changes stand. Intentional cheating is frowned upon.  
- **Bag Always Has 6 Visitors**: After Attract action, Bag must contain exactly 6. Add or remove as needed during setup and after draws.  
- **Can’t Use a Die?**: Use Expand Park as a “consolation” action. Blank dice cannot be used.  
- **Two-Player Variant**: Use 2nd player token instead of 1st to reduce imbalance.
