## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are the last survivors of an ancient civilization, tasked with preserving and passing on millennia-old knowledge through monumental constructions. Build cities, megaliths, and pyramids, and equip them with artifacts and technologies to maximize your legacy. The game ends when any player has at least 14 monument cards in their Past. Victory is determined by scoring victory points (喜) while minimizing lost knowledge (当). The player with the most victory points wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Each player chooses a Builder Board** and places it in front of them.  
   - **Timeline (top)**: Zone for active monuments.  
   - **Past (left)**: Where declined monuments go.  
   - **Artifact Spaces (middle)**: 5 slots for artifact cards.  
   - **Technology Zone (right)**: Sort Technology cards by type (Ancient, Writing, Secret).  
   - **Lost Knowledge Zone (bottom left)**: Place lost knowledge tokens here.  

2. **Prepare the center**:
   - Shuffle all **Builder Cards** into a draw deck; place near table with discard pile space.
   - Deal **10 cards face down** to each player. Players look, keep **6**, discard **4**.
     - 3rd and 4th players draw **1 extra card** before discarding (not in 2-player).
   - Place **3 Technology Tiles** in center: 2 Level I, 1 Level II.
   - Place **3 face-up Level I Technology Cards** on each Level I tile.
   - Place **3 face-up Level II Technology Cards** on the Level II tile.
   - Form **Level I and Level II Technology Card decks** from remaining cards.
   - Place **tokens** in a central reserve.
   - Randomly choose **First Player**, give them the **First Player Token** and **Scorepad**.

*Optional First Game Rule*: Use starting hands (6 cards per symbol). Separate and distribute one random starting deck per player before shuffling the rest.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in turns, clockwise, starting with the first player. Each turn has **3 phases**:

#### A. Action Phase  
Take **2 actions** (can repeat the same action).  
Available actions:  
- **CREATE**  
- **LEARN**  
- **ARCHIVE**  
- **EXCAVATE**  
- **SEARCH**

#### B. Timeline Phase  
Activate all cards (monuments/artifacts) with the **Timeline symbol (⊕)** in your Timeline or on your board.  
Resolve effects in any order.

#### C. Decline Phase  
Slide all monuments in your Timeline **one space left**.  
- Monuments on **space ①** **go into Decline**.  
- For each declining card:  
  1. If it has the **H symbol**, resolve its effect.  
  2. Move all **国 tokens** on it to your **Lost Knowledge zone** (they become 当).  
  3. Move the card to your **Past** (left of board).  
- After Decline:  
  - If any player has **≥7 monuments in Past**, flip one Level I tile to Level II side and refill with Level II cards.  
  - If any player has **≥14 monuments in Past**, the game ends after all players complete the current round.

Then slide remaining Timeline cards left (do not slide artifacts).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### CREATE  
Play a **monument** or **artifact** card.  

**Create a Monument**:  
1. If card has **C*** symbol, discard that many cards from hand.  
2. Place card on its **starting space (○)**.  
   - To play on a different space: discard **1 card per space difference** (e.g., space ③ → ①: discard 2).  
   - **Locked (🔒) cards** cannot be moved from starting space.  
3. Add **国 tokens** equal to number in colored band.  
4. If **φ symbol** is present, resolve effect immediately (as much as possible).  
5. Stacking:  
   - Max 2 cards per space.  
   - New card can go **under or above**, but **cannot be reordered later**.  
   - If only one card remains in a space, it **slides down** to be just above Timeline.  
   - Diagonals are **not adjacent**.  

**Adjacent Cards**:  
- Same space (stacked) or side-by-side in same row.  
- Used for card effects.

**Create an Artifact (V)**:  
- Place on one of 5 artifact spaces.  
- Cannot be covered or moved.  
- Max 5 artifacts per player.  

---

#### LEARN  
Take a **Technology Card** from center:  
- Check requirements (e.g., number of monuments in Past).  
- If met, take card and place in correct **type row** (Ancient, Writing, Secret) on right of board.  
- If **φ symbol**, resolve effect immediately.  
- If **★ symbol**, it gives **victory points at endgame**.  

**Refill Rule**:  
- When a tile has only **1 card left**, discard it and draw **3 new cards** from the corresponding deck (I or II).  
- If deck empty, shuffle discard pile into new deck.  
- If not enough cards to refill, remove tile and unused cards.

**Midgame Change**:  
- When **any player has ≥7 monuments in Past**, flip **one Level I tile** to Level II (player’s choice). Discard current cards and refill with Level II cards.

---

#### ARCHIVE  
- Discard any number of cards from hand.  
- For each card discarded, remove **1 国 token** from any monument in your Timeline.  
- Return tokens to reserve.  
- Cannot use if no 国 tokens in Timeline.

---

#### EXCAVATE  
- Rotate any number of **monument cards in your Past** 90°.  
- For each rotated card, draw **2 Builder Cards**.  
- Rotated cards **must be straightened** (by effect) before being rotated again.

---

#### SEARCH  
- Draw **1 Builder Card** from deck.

---

#### Hand Limit  
- Max **10 cards** in hand.  
- If drawing would exceed 10, stop at 10.

---

#### Deck Exhaustion  
- If Builder deck is empty, **shuffle discard pile** into new deck.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger**:  
- When **any player has ≥14 monuments in their Past**, finish the round (all players equal turns).  
- Then proceed to **Final Scoring**.

**Final Scoring (each player)**:  
- **+ Victory Points (喜)** from:  
  - Colored band of each **monument in Past** (★ value).  
  - **Effects** of monuments in Past (★ activation).  
  - Each **Level II Technology Card** in collection.  
  - **1 point** for each **monument still in Timeline** (★ on card ignored).  
- **–1 point** for each **当 token** in Lost Knowledge zone.

**Winning**:  
- Highest score wins.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Fewest **当 tokens**.  
  2. Most ancient player (oldest birth year).
