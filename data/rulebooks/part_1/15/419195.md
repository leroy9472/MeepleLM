## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Fishing, players take on the role of fishermen competing over 8 rounds to catch the most cards by winning tricks. Each card caught is worth 1 point. Players build personal draw stacks (stockroom stacks) from their caught cards and use them to draw hands in subsequent rounds. If a player’s stockroom is insufficient, they refill from the shared ocean stack. The goal is to score the most points by the end of the 8th round.

2. Components  
- 100 playing cards  
  - 40 starless starting cards (values 1–10 in blue, purple, red, yellow)  
  - 50 cards with 1–5 stars (used to build the ocean stack)  
  - Green trump cards (values 1–16)  
  - Buoy cards with special effects (e.g., "Catch 1 other card", "Pass 1 card to the left", etc.)  
- 5 fisher cards (one per player)  
- 5 boat cards (one per player)  
- 3 round cards (player-count specific)  
- 1 tracking card  
- 2 rule sheets (English & German)  
- Pencil and paper for scoring  

3. Setup  
- Choose a round card matching the number of players (3, 4, or 5).  
- Place the tracking card on the first round row of the round card.  
- Sort the 50 starred cards (1–5 stars) into 5 stacks by star count.  
- Build the ocean stack:  
  - Place 5-star cards face down at the bottom.  
  - Stack 4-star on top, then 3-star, 2-star, and 1-star on top.  
- Set the ocean stack next to the round card.  
- Prepare starting hands based on player count:  
  - 3 players: Remove all "1" and "2" cards, and blue/red "3" cards. Shuffle remaining 30 cards; deal 10 to each player.  
  - 4 players: Remove all "1" cards. Shuffle remaining 36 cards; deal 9 to each player.  
  - 5 players: Shuffle all 40 starless cards; deal 8 to each player.  
- Place removed cards in the box.  
- Each player places their fisher and boat cards in front of them.  
- Use pencil and paper for scoring.  
- Determine starting player for the first trick.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each of the 8 rounds follows this sequence:  
1. Prepare the round:  
   - Move tracking card to current round row.  
   - Draw cards from your stockroom stack (as specified by round card).  
   - If stockroom is insufficient, draw missing cards from the ocean stack in order:  
     - Player needing the most cards draws first.  
     - Ties broken by play order in previous trick (earlier player draws first).  
2. Play tricks:  
   - Play the number of tricks equal to hand size.  
   - In each trick:  
     - Starting player leads a card (color or trump).  
     - Players follow clockwise.  
     - Must follow led color or trump if possible.  
     - If unable, may shed any card.  
     - Special buoy cards may be played regardless of follow rules.  
   - Trick winner:  
     - Highest card of led color wins, unless trump is played.  
     - If trump is played, highest trump wins.  
   - Special card effects resolve at end of trick or for next trick (see Core Mechanics).  
3. End of round:  
   - Count caught cards; score 1 point per card.  
   - Shuffle caught cards and place face down as new stockroom stack on boat.  
     - If old stockroom remains, place new stack *below* it (older cards drawn first).  
4. Proceed to next round.

5. Core Mechanics  
Trick Taking Rules:  
- Leading: Any card may be led.  
- Following: Must follow led color or trump if possible.  
- Shedding: If unable to follow, may play any card.  
- Trumping: Green trump cards beat color cards. If a trump is led, players must follow with trump if able.  

Special Card Effects:  
Cards with “At the end of the trick” effects (buoy cards):  
- “Catch 1 other card” (color 0 or trump 0):  
  - Catch one other card from the trick before winner takes the rest.  
  - Multiple 0s: resolve in order played.  
- “Pass 1 card to the left”:  
  - All players simultaneously choose and pass one card to the left.  
  - Received card is added to hand.  
- “-3 points”:  
  - Record -3 points immediately upon catching.  
  - Still counts as 1 point at round end.  
- “Catch all other cards”:  
  - Catch all other cards in the trick before winner takes only the buoy card.  
  - If 0 cards are also played, resolve in order: buoy first, then 0s.  
  - Only the first 0 after the buoy catches the buoy card; others get nothing.  
  - Winner of trick (highest card) starts next trick, even if they caught nothing.  

Cards with “For the next trick” effects:  
- “Play the 1st card”:  
  - Holder starts next trick instead of trick winner.  
- “Call the color”:  
  - Declare color (including green trump) that all must follow if able.  
  - If no one follows or trumps the called color, the caller wins the trick.  
- “Lowest value wins”:  
  - Lowest card of led color wins (or lowest trump if trump is led or played).  

General Rules:  
- Effects resolve only if played before the last trick (unless specified).  
- If only buoy cards are played in a trick, the first played buoy wins.  
- Buoy cards can be played even when required to follow.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After each round, score 1 point per card caught.  
- After 8 rounds, game ends. Player with most points wins.  
- Tie: Shared victory among top-scoring players.  
- Rare Exception – Overfishing:  
  - If the ocean stack is exhausted and players cannot refill hands, game ends immediately.  
  - Winner is still the player with the most points.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: What if multiple players need the same number of ocean cards?  
  A: The player who played earlier in the previous trick draws first.  
- Q: What happens to unused stockroom cards?  
  A: They remain on the boat. New caught cards are placed *below* them, so older cards are drawn first.  
- Q: Can I play a buoy card even if I can follow suit?  
  A: Yes. Buoy cards can always be played.  
- Q: What if a “Call the color” card is played in the last trick?  
  A: The effect is forfeited, as it only applies to the next trick.  
- Q: Does a “-3 points” card count as a point at round end?  
  A: Yes. It gives -3 immediately but still counts as 1 point when scoring the round.  
- Q: Who starts the first trick of round 2–8?  
  A: The player with the fewest points. Tie: the player who played earlier in the last trick starts.
