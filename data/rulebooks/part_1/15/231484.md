## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Carnival of Monsters*, players compete to join the Royal Monstrological Society by assembling the most impressive menagerie of monsters over four Seasons. Each Season, players draft cards to acquire Lands, capture Monsters, hire Staff, and pursue Secret Goals. Victory Points (VP) are earned from displayed Monsters, completed Secret Goals, Season Trophies, Gold Crowns, and unused Hunter Tokens. The player with the highest score wins.

In **Solo Mode**, you compete against *The Collector*, a wealthy and specialized opponent who automatically plays Dreamlands and matching-type monsters from the discard. Your goal is to score more VP than The Collector by the end of the game.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Phase 1: Reveal Season Card  
- Flip the top Season Card. It specifies a Monster type in demand.  
- **Season Bonus:** First player to play a matching Monster gains 2 Crowns (once per Season).  
- **Trophy:** Awarded at end of Season to player with highest total VP (or Danger symbols) from matching Monsters. Tie = no trophy.  

> **Solo Mode Rule:** The Collector does **not gain or lose Crowns** for any reason.

---

#### Phase 2: Capture and Play Carnival Cards  
All players act simultaneously.  

**Standard Multiplayer Drafting:**  
- Deal 8 cards to each player.  
- Each turn:  
  1. Choose 1 card to capture (place face down).  
  2. Pass remaining cards to neighbor:  
     - Seasons 1 & 3: pass left  
     - Seasons 2 & 4: pass right  
  3. Decide: Play or Keep the captured card.  
- Repeat until all cards are captured.  

**Solo Mode Drafting (vs. The Collector):**  
- Instead of passing, draw from the deck for each hand:  
  - Draw 8 → choose 1 → rest go face down to **Waste pile**  
  - Draw 7 → choose 1 → rest to Waste  
  - Draw 6 → choose 1 → to Waste  
  - Draw 5 → choose 1 → to Waste  
  - Draw 4 → choose 1 → to Waste  
- Then shuffle Waste and continue:  
  - Draw 3 → choose 1 → return 2 face down to bottom of Waste  
  - Draw 2 → choose 1 → return 1 face down to bottom  
  - Draw 1 → play or keep as usual  
- Use tracker + 20-point token to track progress.  

**After Player Drafting (Solo Mode):**  
- Turn Waste pile **face up**.  
- Search for:  
  - All **Dreamlands** monsters  
  - All monsters matching **The Collector’s 3 starting Land types**  
- **Play all matching monsters for The Collector.**  
- For each played monster with **Monstrous Lore**, draw 1 card and play it if it matches above criteria. Discard rest.

#### Card Types & Actions  

**Land Cards:**  
- Provide Land Points to play Monsters.  
- Distant Lands:  
  - 1 symbol: need ≥1 same-region Land in play  
  - 2 symbols: need ≥2 same-region Lands  
- Land Points can be partially used and reused next Season.  

**Monster Cards:**  
- Cost = Level (in top corner). Pay with matching Land Points.  
- **Dreamlands Monsters:** Can use **any** Land Points to play.  
- **Dangerous Monsters:** Have Danger symbols → trigger Danger Check.  
- **Monstrous Lore:** When played, draw 1 card immediately (can play or keep free).  

**Staff Cards:**  
- Cost Gold Crowns to play.  
- Provide ongoing effects.  
- **Intrepid Explorers:** Also count as 1 Land Point (player chooses type when played).  

**Event Cards:**

---

#### Phase 3: Danger Check!  
- Total Danger symbols from Monsters **played this Season**.  
- Must cover all with Hunters:  
  - **Royal Hunters:** Roll 3 dice → sum cages (0, 1, or 2 each). Shared by all players.  
  - **Staff Hunters:** From Staff Cards. Use once per Season.  
  - **Hunter Tokens:** Spend 1 token per Danger symbol. Can be saved.  
- If short: pay **3 Crowns per uncovered Danger symbol**.  
  - Cannot pay? Take Loans to cover.  

> **Solo Mode Rule:** The Collector **ignores Danger Check** and pays **no fines**.

---

#### Phase 4: Seasons End  
1. **Award Trophy:**  
   - Compare total VP (or Danger symbols) of Monsters matching Season type.  
   - Highest total wins Trophy (3 VP). Tie → The Collector wins in Solo Mode.  
2. **Retire Monsters:**  
   - Move all Monsters played this Season to Menagerie (face down).  
   - Keep Land Cards in play.  
   - The Collector retires their monsters too.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After Season 4:  
- Reveal all Secret Goals. Score if completed.  
- Total VP from:  
  - All Monsters in Menagerie  
  - Completed Secret Goals  
  - 1 VP per Gold Crown  
  - 1 VP per unused Hunter Token  
  - 3 VP per Season Trophy  
- Subtract **5 VP per Loan Card** (or 15 for Consolidated Loan)  

**Solo Mode Victory:**

- If your score > The Collector’s → you win.

- **Can I play Kept Cards during Danger Check?**  
  Yes, but **before** rolling dice. Players must have chance to play cards.

- **Can The Collector gain Crowns?**  
  No. The Collector **never gains or loses Crowns**.  
- **Do I shuffle Waste before drawing back?**  
  Yes. After initial 5 draws, **shuffle Waste** before drawing 3, then 2, then 1.  
- **What if no matching cards found in Waste for The Collector?**  
  The Collector plays nothing that round.
