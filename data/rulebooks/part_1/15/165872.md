## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Liberty or Death is a strategic board game simulating the American Revolutionary War. The British aim to maintain control by advancing population Support to equal or exceed Opposition.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends during final Winter Quarters.  
- Victory Conditions:  
  - British: Support ≥ Opposition  
  - Patriots: Opposition > Support  
- No early victory possible.  
- Control is assessed per space based on unit presence and Population.  
- French Resources (Winter Quarters):  
  - Before TOA: 2 × number of Squadron/Blockade markers in West Indies.  
  - After TOA: FNI level + sum of population in non-British-Controlled Cities (+5 if West Indies under Rebellion Control).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **FNI at Level 3**: Blocks British Garrison and Muster. British cannot Muster Regulars in Blockaded Cities or adjacent Colonies unless also adjacent to a non-Blockaded City.  
- **Combined Defense**: In Battles, Royalists (British) make all choices if defending with Patriots. Patriots make all choices if French are sole defender.  
- **Win the Day with Washington**: Doubles shift of Support/Opposition (max 6 instead of 3).  
- **Howe’s Capability**: If FNI = 1 and TOA played, British may use Howe to reduce FNI to 0, then execute FNI Special Activity for 1D3 Resources.  
- **French Movement**: French do not pay for March/Battle; Patriots pay per space if French participate.  
- **Indians**: Cannot initiate Battles. Participate via Scout or War Path. Villages removed only after War Parties exhausted.  
- **Blockade Reassignment**: After French Redeployment (8.6.9), remove Blockade from City with least Support; move remaining Blockades to Cities with most Support.  
- **Committees of Correspondence (8.5.9)**: Prioritize spaces with fewest Raid markers; largest possible (Opposition − Support) shift. Do not execute if only Raid markers would be removed.
