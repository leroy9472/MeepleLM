## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   In 1901, New York City is experiencing a skyscraper boom. As real estate developers, players compete to build the most prestigious skyline by acquiring land, constructing skyscrapers across Manhattan’s districts, and strategically upgrading older buildings. The objective is to score the most victory points (VP) through construction, control of streets, and fulfilling bonus challenges.

2. **Components**  
   - 1 Game Board (divided into 5 colored districts: Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, Pink)  
   - 65 Territory Cards (matching size-2 and size-3 lots on the board)  
   - 76 Skyscrapers (19 per player: bronze, silver, gold)  
   - 4 Legendary Skyscrapers (communal, first-come)  
   - 16 Workers (4 per player)  
   - 4 King Tokens (1 per player)  
   - 12 Action Cards (3 per player)  
   - 5 Character Cards (1 per player)  
   - 5 Streets of New York Cards (3 used per game)  
   - 5 Bonus Challenge Cards (1 used per game)  
   - 4 Score Tokens (1 per player)  
   - Scoring Track (on board perimeter)  

3. **Setup**  
   - For 2 players: Remove David Schneider Character Card and all pink Territory Cards.  
   - Place board in center; place 4 Legendary Skyscrapers nearby.  
   - Each player receives:  
     - 18 Skyscrapers, 1 Starter Building, 4 Workers, 1 King Token, 3 Action Cards, 1 Score Token  
     - 1 random Character Card  
   - Place Score Token at 0 on Scoring Track.  
   - Deal 3 Streets of New York Cards and 1 Bonus Challenge Card faceup.  
   - Place Starter Building on the size-2 lot matching the symbol on your Character Card.  
   - Remove matching Territory Card from deck and place on Character Card.  
   - Shuffle remaining Territory Cards; deal 4 faceup (Open Market), rest form Future Market (face down).  
   - Starting player is chosen (e.g., most recent visitor to NYC).

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

   **A. Expand and (Optional) Build**  
   - If you have an available Worker:  
     1. Take 1 faceup Territory Card from Open Market → place on Character Card.  
     2. Place a Worker on a matching size/color lot on the board.  
   - Replenish Open Market to 4 cards.  
   - Then:  
     - Build 1 skyscraper in your Estate (optional this turn), or  
     - Pass to next player (skip Build step).

   **B. Demolish and Build**  
   - Choose a new skyscraper to build (must be silver/gold, depending on score).  
   - Remove all your skyscrapers and Workers under its footprint.  
     - Demolished skyscrapers return to box (cannot be reused).  
     - All demolished buildings must be of a lower generation (bronze < silver < gold).  
   - If demolition leaves any of your lots completely vacant, you **must** cover each with a Worker.  
     - If you lack Workers to do so → cannot perform this action.  
   - Build the new skyscraper on the cleared footprint (may extend into adjacent owned lots).  
   - Reclaim Workers from built-on lots.  
   - Score points for new skyscraper.  
   - **Must build after demolishing.**

   **C. Build Only (Special Case)**  
   - If you have no available Workers and cannot/won’t demolish → skip Expand, go straight to Build.  
   - If you have no Workers and cannot Build or Demolish → reclaim 1 Worker from board, return matching Territory Card to bottom of Future Market, then pass.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Estate**: All acquired lots form your Estate. You may build across multiple lots/districts within it.  
   - **Technology Generations**:  
     - Bronze: Available from start.  
     - Silver: Unlocked at 6 VP.  
     - Gold: Unlocked at 18 VP.  
     - Legendary Skyscrapers: Gold-tier; communal; place King Token when built; only 1 per player.  
   - **Rules of Construction**:  
     - Skyscraper must fit entirely within your Estate.  
     - Must touch a street or park (side, not corner).  
     - May span multiple lots/districts.  
     - Does not need to fill entire lot.  
     - Cannot build over existing buildings (except during demolition).  
   - **Action Cards** (usable once per game, on your turn):  
     - **Construction Boom**: Take an extra Build action this turn. Cannot use if fewer than 4 unbuilt skyscrapers remain.  
     - **Market Shift**: Refresh Open Market (shuffle faceup cards into Future Market, draw 4 new).  
     - **Land Grab**: Acquire 2 size-2 Territory Cards this turn (must have 2 Workers). Cannot use if Future Market is empty.  
   - **Demolition Rules**:  
     - Only one new building per turn (even if demolishing multiple).  
     - Cannot demolish gold or Legendary Skyscrapers.  
     - Starter Building can be demolished.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - **End Game Triggered When**:  
     - One player has only 4 unbuilt skyscrapers left, **OR**  
     - Open Market has only 3 cards and Future Market is empty.  
   - The triggering player completes their turn.  
   - Each other player takes **one final turn**.  
   - Then proceed to **Scoring Phase**.

   **Final Scoring**:  
   - Points from built skyscrapers (on Scoring Track).  
   - **Streets of New York (3 cards)**: 5 VP to player with most skyscrapers on each street.  
     - Skyscraper touching multiple streets counts for each.  
     - Tie → no one scores.  
   - **Bonus Challenge Card** (1 in play):  
     - **Gold Tycoon**: 3 VP per district with ≥2 gold skyscrapers. Building across districts counts for both.  
     - **Bronze Baron**: 5/10/15 VP for 4/5/6 standing bronze skyscrapers.  
     - **Master Architect**: 3/6/10 VP for 3/4/5+ irregular-shaped (hexagon-marked) skyscrapers.  
     - **Generation King**: 5 VP per generation (bronze/silver/gold) where you have the most skyscrapers (tie → no score).  
     - **Gold Prestige**: 1 VP per opponent’s bronze/silver skyscraper touched by your gold skyscraper (scored **during game** when built).  
   - **Unused Action Cards**: 1 VP each.

   **Tiebreaker**:  
   1. Player with tallest Legendary Skyscraper (height value).  
   2. If no Legendary or tied: most gold skyscrapers.  
   3. If still tied: shared victory.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **No Workers?**  
     - Can still Build if possible.  
     - Cannot Expand unless you reclaim a Worker (via special case).  
   - **Demolition leaves vacant lots?**  
     - Must cover each with a Worker. If insufficient Workers → cannot demolish.  
   - **Can I build without expanding or demolishing?**  
     - Yes, if you have no Workers or choose not to Expand.  
   - **Can I demolish and not build?**  
     - No. Demolish requires immediate Build.  
   - **Can I build a Legendary Skyscraper without demolishing?**  
     - Yes, during Build step, if you have space and gold access.  
   - **Multiple actions per turn?**  
     - Only via **Construction Boom** (extra Build). No double Expand or Demolish.  
   - **Starter Building**:  
     - Does not score VP.  
     - Counts toward Estate. Can be demolished like any building.
