## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
In *It's a Wonderful Kingdom*, players are rival dukes vying to restore the rightful heir to the throne—themselves. The goal is to develop your duchy most effectively over 4 rounds by strategically selecting and using cards to generate resources, construct developments, and earn Victory Points (VP). The player with the most VP at the end of the 4th round wins. Ties are broken by: (1) most cards in your duchy, (2) most Soldier tokens, then (3) shared victory.

- **Calamity/Menace Deck**:  
  - Base/Quest/Advisors: Place 8 Calamity cards face-up beside deck.  
  - Menace module: Remove Calamity cards. Each player chooses a Menace deck (e.g., Frost Giants, Thieves).  
- **Solo Mode**:  
  - Create a Danger deck: 8 random Development cards + 4 Calamity (or Menace) cards, shuffled face down.  
  - Flip Development deck face up.  
- Each player:  
  - Takes a Duchy card (both must use same side: A or B).  
  - Takes 2 Trap tokens (or 1 in solo mode).

  - (Conquest module) Takes 12 Army meeples; places 4 on board, 8 in reserve.  
- Place Resource cubes and Soldiers on board.  
- (Solo) Place 2 cards from Development deck face up in each Offering area.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
The game lasts 4 rounds. Each round has 3 phases:  
**A. Choice Phase** (turn-based)  
**B. Planning Phase** (simultaneous)  
**C. Production Phase** (simultaneous)  
*(Menace module adds D. Combat Phase; Conquest module adds E. Conquest Phase)*

**A. Choice Phase**  
- **Player Order**: Round-Tracker arrow determines 1st player (offers first, selects last).  
- **Hand Size**: Each player draws 7 Development cards + 1 Calamity (or Menace card in Menace module) = 8 cards.  
- **Offering Areas**: 2 zones on the board.  
- **Initial Setup**: Place 1 Development card face up in each Offering area.  
- **Turn Sequence** (16 turns total, alternating):  
  1. **Offering Turn**: Active player selects 2 cards from hand and places them face up (or face down using Trap tokens) in one or both Offering areas.  
  2. **Selection Turn**: Opponent chooses one Offering area, takes **all** cards from it into their Selection area (do not flip face-down cards).  
- **Trap Tokens**: Spend 1 per card placed face down. You start each round with 2. Spent tokens are recovered at the start of next round.  
- **Accumulation**: Cards not selected remain in Offering areas and accumulate.  
- **End**: Phase ends when both players empty their hands. Discard remaining cards in Offering areas.

*Solo Mode Variation*:  
- You select an Offering area, then:  
  1. Add 1 card from Danger deck face down to unselected area.  
  2. Add 2 cards from Development deck to emptied area.  
- Repeat 4 times (last time: only select).  
- **Search Action**: After selecting, discard 2 face-up Development cards to peek at top 3 of deck and add one to the selected offering.

**B. Planning Phase** (simultaneous)  
- Flip all face-down cards in Selection area face up.  
- For each card, choose:  
  - **Slate for Construction**: Move to Construction area (card is now "under construction").  
  - **Recycle**: Discard card and gain resource shown in top-right banner. Place resource on a card under construction or in Alchemy area of Duchy card.  
- **Special Cards**:  
  - **Treasure**: Must be recycled; grants 2 resources.  
  - **Calamity**: Cannot be recycled; add directly to Duchy; worth -4 VP.  
  - **Menace**: Cannot be recycled or constructed; goes to Construction area; apply effect immediately.  
  - **Advisor**: Goes directly to Advisors’ area; grants 1 Soldier token; ability becomes active.  
- **Immediate Construction Completion**: If recycling provides final resource to complete a card under construction, do so now (see Production phase).

**C. Production Phase** (simultaneous, in order: Materials → Population → Gold → Exploration)  
For each resource type:  
1. **Production**: Count matching icons in your Duchy (Duchy card + constructed Development cards).  
   - Cards with  ,  ,  , or   produce 1 for each card of that type in your Duchy.  
2. **Supremacy Bonus**: Announce total. If you produce more than opponent:  
   - Take 1 Soldier from Training area, or  
   - Place 1 Soldier in Training area.  
   *(Solo: Supremacy only if you produce ≥5 of that resource.)*  
3. **Resource Allocation**: Take cubes equal to your production. Distribute among:  
   - Cards under construction  
   - Alchemy area on Duchy card  
   - Cannot save, move, or hoard (except Krystallium).  
4. **Construction Completion**: When a card under construction has all required resources:  
   - Return resources/Soldiers to supply.  
   - Gain Construction bonus (e.g., Krystallium, Soldiers).  
   - Place card in Duchy (overlap previous, keep icons visible).  
   - Begins producing next round.

**Transmuting into Krystallium**  
- Any time you have 5 cubes in Alchemy area (any mix), discard them to gain 1 Krystallium cube.  
- Krystallium can be used as any resource (except Soldiers).  
- Cubes in Alchemy are locked; cannot be retrieved.

**D. Combat Phase** (Menace module only)  
- After Production, vanquish Menaces in your Construction area by spending required Soldiers.  
- Return vanquished Menaces to box.  
- Unvanquished Menaces remain and continue to affect you.  
- **Menace Types**:  
  - **Frost Giants**: Must be placed under a card under construction; freezes it until vanquished.  
  - **Giant Rats**: Add 1 Vermin per Rat in Construction.  
  - **Shadows**: For each Shadow, discard 1 card from Selection (no bonus); opponent gains 1 resource in Alchemy.  
  - **Thieves**: Cover 1 production icon on Duchy with Stolen token; restores when Thief is vanquished.

**E. Conquest Phase** (Conquest module only)  
- Turn-based; player with more Soldiers starts (tie: Round-Tracker player).  
- On your turn, do one:  
  - **Recruit**: Spend 1 Soldier per army to place from reserve to castle.  
  - **Move**: Move armies into adjacent territory. Must outnumber enemy armies there. Equal losses: send armies back to castles.  
  - **Pass**.  
- Control of territories earns VP (see End Game).  
- **Prison**: Control allows imprisoning enemy armies.  
- (Solo) Blue automatically passes; territories with 0 armies get 1 Blue army.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Resource Types**: Materials, Population, Gold, Exploration, Krystallium, Soldiers.  
- **Construction**: Cards must be fully resourced to join Duchy.  
- **Krystallium**: Universal resource; made from 5 Alchemy cubes.  
- **Soldiers**: Earned via Supremacy, Construction bonuses, or Advisors. Used in modules.  
- **Trap Tokens**: Enable hidden offers; reset each round.

  - Development: Construct or recycle.  
  - Treasure: Recycle for 2 resources.  
  - Calamity: -4 VP.  
  - Menace: Ongoing negative effects.  
  - Advisor: Activate abilities by paying Soldiers.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
After Round 4:  
1. **Gross VP**: VP from cards in Duchy not dependent on card counts.  
2. **Combo VP**: VP based on number of cards of a type (e.g., "3 VP per Monument").  
3. **Penalties**:  
   - Calamity cards: -4 VP each.  
   - Unvanquished Menaces: Apply endgame penalties per deck.  
4. **Module Bonuses**:  
   - Conquest: VP from controlled territories.  
   - Quest: Must complete final step to be eligible to win.  
5. **Other**:  
   - Krystallium and Soldiers: 0 VP.  
   - Cards under construction: 0 VP.  
   - (Duchy side A): -15 VP in solo mode.

**Winning**: Highest score wins. Tiebreakers:  
1. Most cards in Duchy  
2. Most Soldier tokens  
3. Shared victory
