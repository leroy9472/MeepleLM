### 1. Lore & Objective
No Retreat! is a grand strategic level wargame simulating the Eastern Front of World War II from Operation Barbarossa in 1941 to the fall of Berlin in 1945. Players control either the Axis (Germany and allies) or the Soviet Union, competing for control of key cities and objectives across Eastern Europe.

Victory can be achieved through multiple paths:
- **Objectives Victory**: Control and supply key objective hexes.
- **Sudden Death Victory**: Reach a required Victory Point (VP) threshold during specific turns.
- **Soviet Total Victory**: Reach 34 VPs or eliminate the Berlin Garrison.
- **German Operational Victory**: Achieve superior territorial gains by Turn 23.
- **Final Victory**: If no other condition is met by Turn 28, the Axis wins.
