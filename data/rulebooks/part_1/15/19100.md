## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are ranchers in Argentina managing land, animals, and resources to build profitable haciendas. The goal is to score the most victory points by:  
- Connecting herds to markets  
- Creating long land chains  
- Building haciendas on land or herds  
- Placing water tiles adjacent to tiles  
- Earning money (converted to points)  

The game ends after a final scoring. The player with the most points wins; ties are broken by cash on hand.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board (recommended: symmetrical side) in the center.  
2. Each player takes:  
   - 1 Hacienda (placed on 0 of victory point track)  
   - 30 animal markers (one color)  
   - 20 pesos (starting capital)  
   - 1 rule summary card  
3. Shuffle the **80 land cards**, deal **8 to each player**, place the rest face-down. Reveal top 4 face-up beside the board.  
4. Shuffle **72 animal cards**. Return some to box based on player count:  
   - 2 players: return 18 cards  
   - 3 players: return 12 cards  
   - 4 players: return 6 cards  
   - 5 players: use all  
   Then deal **4 animal cards** to each player. Reveal 4 face-up beside the board.  
   Split remaining animal cards into **two equal stacks**. Place one beside land deck; set aside the other for later.  
5. Place all **hexagonal land tiles** in a supply.  
6. Place **four 1×1 water tiles** on the four starting water fields. Place remaining water tiles within reach.  
7. Place **neutral haciendas** and **harvest chips** beside the board.  
8. Appoint a **banker** to manage money and bank actions.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On a turn, perform **three actions in any order** from the following:  
1. **Buy an item** (land card, animal card, Hacienda, or water tile)  
2. **Play a card** (land or animal)  
3. **Play a harvest token** (only once per round)  

Each action is performed once per turn, except buying items (can buy multiple, each counts as one action).

---

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### A. Buy an Item  
Each purchase costs pesos paid to the bank.  

| Item | Source | Cost | Notes |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| Land Card | Face-down deck | 2 pesos | Draw and add to hand |
| Land Card | Face-up display | 3 pesos | Replace immediately with top card from deck |
| Animal Card | Face-down deck | 2 pesos | Add to hand |
| Animal Card | Face-up display | 3 pesos | Replace immediately |
| Hacienda | Supply | 12 pesos | Can only buy once per turn. Must place **immediately** on own land chain or herd **without** an existing Hacienda. Scores VP equal to size of chain/herd at scoring. |
| Water Tile | Supply | 12 pesos | Can only buy once per turn. Choose any shape. Place **immediately** on **free pampas spaces**. Must fit exactly (no overlapping or partial placement). Adjacent tiles score 1 VP each at scoring. |

> Note: You may play a card immediately after buying it, but doing so requires a separate "Play a Card" action.

#### B. Play a Card  

##### Land Cards  
- If card matches a terrain type (mountain, forest, meadow, rock, moorland):  
  → Place your land tile on **any empty space** of that terrain type.  
- If card is **pampas**:  
  → Place your land tile on **any free pampas space adjacent to your existing land tile**.  
- If **no matching terrain space is available**:  
  → Treat the card as a **pampas card** (place on adjacent pampas).  

> Once played, discard the card.  

**Land Chain**: Adjacent land tiles of the same color.  
- Chains of **3 or more tiles** score VP at scoring: **2 VP per tile**  
- Single tiles and 2-tile chains score **0**  

Tip: Plan for long chains early.

---

##### Animal Cards  
- Play a corresponding animal marker (e.g., pig card → pig-side-up animal tile)  
- Place on **any free pampas space** that is adjacent to:  
  - Your **land tile**, or  
  - Your **animal tile** of the **same animal type**  

> Discard the card after playing.  

**Herd**: Adjacent animal tiles of the same type and player.  
- Herds can be any size.  
- Herds of **any size** can connect to markets.  
- Herds from different players may be adjacent.  

**Market Connection**:  
- When a herd **first touches** a side of a market, receive money:  
  > **(Number of animal tiles in herd) + (Number of connected land tiles)** = pesos earned  
- Each **market side** can only trigger once (per player/herd).  
- If a single move connects to **multiple market sides**, earn money **for each side**.  
- Increasing a herd that already touches a market → **no additional money** unless a new market side is reached.  

> Connected markets count for scoring even if herd is size 1.

Tip: Leave pampas space for future water tiles.

---

#### C. Play a Harvest Token (Once per Round)  
- Take a harvest chip and place it on **one of your land chains** with no existing harvest token.  
- Receive **3 pesos per land tile** in the chain.  
  > Example: 5-tile chain → 15 pesos  

- If **all 8 harvest chips are in use**:  
  → Move **any chip from an opponent’s chain** to your own chain.  
  → The vacated chain may be harvested again later.  

> Only one harvest action per player per round.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Scoring Triggers  
- **Intermediate Scoring**: When the first stack of animal cards is exhausted, replace it with the second (set-aside) stack. After the current round ends, conduct scoring.  
- **Final Scoring**: When the second stack is exhausted, play the round to completion, then final scoring ends the game.

#### Scoring Order  
1. **Markets**  
2. **Land Chains**  
3. **Haciendas**  
4. **Water Tiles**  
5. **Money**

---

##### 1. Markets  
- Score based on **number of different markets** your herds touch (regardless of how many sides or herds).  
- Use this table:  

| Markets Connected | Points |
|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 15 |
| 6 | 21 |
| 7 | 28 |
| 8 | 36 |
| 9 | 45 |
| 10 | 55 |
| 11 | 66 |

> Example: 5 markets → 15 points

---

##### 2. Land Chains  
- Only chains of **3 or more tiles** score.  
- Score: **2 VP per tile** in qualifying chains.  
> Example: one 7-tile chain + two 3-tile chains → (7+3+3) × 2 = 26 VP  
- Singles and doubles score **0**

---

##### 3. Haciendas  
- Each Hacienda scores **equal to the number of tiles** in the chain or herd it sits on.  
- If multiple Haciendas end up on the same chain due to merging, **only one scores** (player chooses which).  
> Example: Hacienda on 7-tile land chain → 7 VP; another on 6-sheep herd → 6 VP → total 13 VP

---

##### 4. Water Tiles  
- Score **1 VP for each adjacent land or animal tile** (any player) bordering the water.  
- Owner of the tile gets the point.  
- Water tiles placed at start or during game all score.  
- **Suggestion**: Turn scored water tiles face-down during intermediate scoring; flip back after.  

> Example: a 2-space water tile with 3 adjacent red tiles → red scores 3 VP

---

##### 5. Money  
- **1 VP per 10 pesos** (round down).  
> Example: 28 pesos → 2 VP

---

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I play a land card if no space of that type remains?**  
A: Yes. Treat it as a pampas card: place on any free pampas adjacent to your land.

**Q: Can I place a water tile anywhere on pampas?**  
A: Only if it fits exactly on **free** pampas spaces. You cannot split it or overlap.

**Q: Do I get money every time I grow a herd?**  
A: Only when the herd **first touches** a new market side. Growing an already-connected herd earns nothing.

**Q: Can I have more than one Hacienda on a chain?**  
A: Yes, but only **one scores**. Choose which one to count.

**Q: Can I harvest a chain that already has a harvest chip?**  
A: Only by **stealing** the chip from another player’s chain. Then your chain can be harvested.

**Q: What if I run out of animal tiles?**  
A: Flip existing double-sided tiles to reuse animal types. If all 15 of a type are on board, none can be reused.

**Q: Can herds of different animals be adjacent?**  
A: Yes. Only same-animal tiles form a herd.

**Q: Do water tiles score for multiple players?**  
A: Yes. Each adjacent tile scores for its **owner**.
