# 1. Lore & Objective
GIPF is a strategic two-player board game centered around capturing opponent's pieces and controlling the board through tactical placement and special "potentials." The goal is to either exhaust the opponent's reserve of pieces or remove all of their GIPF-pieces from the board, depending on the version played.

# 2. Components
- 1 game board with 37 central spots and 24 surrounding dots
- 18 white basic pieces
- 18 black basic pieces
- 1 bag (for storage)
- 1 rulebook
- Potentials (additional pieces from other games in the GIPF project: GIPF, TAMSK, ZÉRTZ, DVONN, PUNCT, YINSH)

# 3. Setup
### Basic Rules:
- Players determine color; White begins.
- Board is placed so dot "E1" faces White player.
- Each player places 3 alternating pieces on angular dots and pushes them to the first central spot.
- Each player has 12 pieces remaining in reserve (15 total per player; 3 extra may be used to balance skill levels).

### Standard Rules:
- Same as Basic, but players start with 3 GIPF-pieces (two stacked basic pieces) instead of basic pieces.
- All 18 basic pieces are used (no extra pieces for balancing).

### Tournament Rules:
- Board starts empty.
- Each player has 18 basic pieces in reserve.
- First turn: both players must bring a GIPF-piece into play.
- Players may continue bringing GIPF-pieces into play until they choose to play a single basic piece—after which no more GIPF-pieces may be introduced.

# 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Place on Dot**: On your turn, take a piece from your reserve and place it on any of the 24 surrounding dots.
2. **Push into Play**: Push the piece from the dot along a line into the central play area, moving one spot at a time. This may:
   - Move to a free spot.
   - Push existing pieces along the line (one by one, same direction), clearing space to place your piece.
3. **Trigger Capture**: If 4 or more same-colored pieces form a contiguous line, they and any adjacent pieces in line must be captured:
   - Owner of the 4-line captures their own pieces (returned to reserve).
   - Opponent’s pieces are captured (removed from the game).
4. **Special Potentials**: If a piece has a potential (e.g., ZÉRTZ, DVONN), you may choose to deploy its special ability instead of a normal push.

# 5. Core Mechanics
- **Pushing**: All moves begin by placing a piece on a dot, then pushing it into the board along a line. Pieces can only move one spot per push.
- **Line Capture**: When 4 or more same-colored pieces form a straight line, the entire contiguous line (including extensions) is captured. Capturing is mandatory.
- **GIPF-Pieces**: Consist of two stacked basic pieces, count as one piece on the board. Players must always have at least one GIPF-piece in play or they lose.
  - GIPF-pieces are optional to capture—player may choose to leave them on the board.
  - If a player captures their own GIPF-piece, it returns to reserve as two separate basic pieces (cannot be reused as a GIPF-piece).
- **Intersecting Lines**: If multiple 4-lines of the same color intersect:
  - Non-intersecting lines: all must be captured.
  - Intersecting lines: player chooses one to capture, unless a GIPF-piece is at the intersection, in which case they may take one or both lines.
- **Simultaneous Capture**: If both players have capturable lines, the player who caused the situation captures first.

### Potentials (Special Abilities)
- **GIPF**: Player must always have at least one uncovered GIPF-piece in play; if not, they lose.
- **TAMSK**: When a TAMSK piece reaches the center intersection, its potential is activated and must be pushed into play as part of the same turn.
- **ZÉRTZ**: Instead of pushing, leap over one or more adjacent pieces (must be adjacent) and land in the first empty space. Cannot leap out of bounds.
- **DVONN**: Instead of pushing, deploy by stepping onto an adjacent enemy basic or DVONN piece. The captured piece remains under it and is revealed when the DVONN potential is removed.
- **PUNCT**: Instead of pushing, step onto an adjacent enemy GIPF or PUNCT piece. After capture, replace it with either a basic piece or a new GIPF-piece from supply.
- **YINSH**: Instead of pushing, slide any distance along a straight line of empty spots.

# 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Basic Rules**: Game ends when a player cannot bring a piece into play (no reserve left). That player loses; the other wins.
- **Standard & Tournament Rules**: Game ends if:
  - A player has no pieces left in reserve, or
  - A player has no GIPF-pieces on the board.
- A tie is impossible. The first player to run out of reserve or lose all GIPF-pieces loses.
- Capturing pieces does not count as a turn.

# 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you push a piece out of the board?** No. Pushing off the board is illegal.
- **What if a move causes multiple captures?** All capturable lines must be resolved. If both players can capture, the player who made the move captures first.
- **Can you capture your own pieces?** Yes, and doing so returns them to your reserve—this is a key strategy.
- **What happens when a GIPF-piece is in a capture line?** The capturing player may choose to leave it on the board or capture it.
- **Can you use a potential more than once?** No. Potentials are single-use per game.
- **Can you bring a GIPF-piece back after using basic pieces?** No. Once a player uses a basic piece, they cannot introduce new GIPF-pieces.
- **Are potentials mandatory?** No. You may choose to make a normal push instead of using a potential.
