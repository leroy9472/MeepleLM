## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Captain Ecarrasse*, players dive into the depths of the ocean to recover valuable loot from a sunken treasure trove. Each dive is a risk: push too far and trigger a diving incident, losing everything. Return early and secure your haul. The goal is to collect the most valuable cards by the end of the game and emerge as the richest diver.

### 2. Components  
- **60 Loot Cards**: Divided into 10 suits, each with 6 cards.  
  - 9 suits: values 2–7  
  - Mermaid suit: values 4–9  
- **17 Diver Cards**: Unique characters with special abilities. Some duplicates exist but with different skills.  
- **6 Variant Cards**: Optional rules modifiers for varied gameplay.  
- **4 Game Aid Cards**: Summarize the effects of each loot suit.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Form Davy Jones’ Locker**:  
   - Remove the lowest-numbered card (i.e., the 2, or 4 for Mermaids) from each of the 10 suits.  
   - Shuffle these 10 cards and place them face-down as **Davy Jones’ Locker**.  
   - During the game, all cards added to this pile go face-down. Players cannot look at it unless a card effect allows it.

2. **Form the Loot Deck**:  
   - The remaining 50 loot cards form the **Loot Deck**. Shuffle and place face-down next to Davy Jones’ Locker.  
   - Players may count the number of cards in the Loot Deck at any time.

3. **Optional – Diver Cards**:  
   - Shuffle the 17 Diver cards.  
   - Deal one to each player.  
   - If any player receives a duplicate character (same image), discard one and deal a replacement.  
   - Each player places their Diver card face-up in front of them. These grant special abilities that modify loot card effects.

4. **Starting Player**:  
   - The player who most recently saw the ocean becomes the starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, they perform the following steps:

#### A. Reveal a Loot Card  
- Reveal the top card of the **Loot Deck** and place it in the **Exploration area**.  
- **Immediately apply its Effect**, unless it is a Chest or Key (see below).

#### B. Choose: Continue or Return  
After applying the effect, the player chooses:
- **Continue Exploring (Press Your Luck)**  
- **Return to the Surface (End Turn)**

#### C. Continue Exploring  
- Reveal the next card from the Loot Deck.  
- If the suit of the new card **is not already present** in the Exploration area:  
  - Add it to the Exploration area.  
  - Apply its Effect.  
  - Repeat the choice.  
- If the suit **is already present**:  
  - A **Diving Incident** occurs.  
  - The new card is **not added** to the Exploration.  
  - Its Effect is **not applied**.  
  - All cards in the Exploration area (except those saved by Anchor) are placed into **Davy Jones’ Locker**.  
  - The player gains **nothing** and their turn ends.

#### D. Return to the Surface  
- The player collects **all cards** from the Exploration area.  
- These are placed into their **Hold** (personal collection area).  
- Cards must be sorted by suit, in ascending order (lowest card underneath), with values clearly visible.  
- If both **Key and Chest** are present in the Exploration when returning:  
  - Shuffle Davy Jones’ Locker.  
  - Draw a number of cards equal to the total number of cards collected (including Key and Chest).  
  - Add these drawn cards to the player’s Hold.  
- Turn ends.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Effects of Loot Cards  
Each suit has a unique ability. These are triggered **as soon as the card is revealed into the Exploration area**, unless otherwise noted.  
The only exceptions are **Chest** and **Key**, whose combined effect activates only upon **returning to the surface**.

- **Anchor**:  
  If a Diving Incident occurs, you **still collect** all cards revealed **before** the Anchor. The Anchor and all cards after it go to Davy Jones’ Locker.

- **Giant Squid**:  
  After revealing this card, you **must** place **two more cards** into the Exploration before you can return.  
  - If a **Harpoon**, **Net**, or **Treasure Map** is revealed during these forced draws, its effect also triggers.  
  - If that effect forces another draw, it counts toward the Giant Squid’s requirement.

- **Treasure Map**:  
  - Shuffle Davy Jones’ Locker.  
  - Reveal the top 3 cards (or fewer if the pile is small).  
  - Choose **one** to place into the Exploration area.  
    - This can **trigger an incident** — if so, the incident occurs immediately.  
  - If Davy Jones’ Locker is empty, do nothing.

- **Knife**:  
  Choose a suit from **an opponent’s Hold**. The **highest-value card** of that suit is removed and placed into **Davy Jones’ Locker**.  
  - If no opponent has cards, do nothing.

- **Net**:  
  Choose a suit from **your own Hold**. Place the **highest-value card** of that suit into the Exploration area and **apply its effect**.  
  - This may trigger an incident.  
  - If it does, you lose that card and all in the Exploration.  
  - If you have no cards in your Hold, do nothing.

- **Harpoon**:  
  Choose a suit from **an opponent’s Hold** that you **do not have** in your own Hold.  
  - Steal the **highest-value card** of that suit.  
  - Place it into the Exploration and **apply its effect**.  
  - This may trigger an incident.

- **Mermaid**:  
  - No special effect.  
  - Cards are worth **4 to 9 points** instead of 2 to 7.

- **Chest & Key**:  
  - Their effect only triggers when **both are present** in the Exploration **and** you **Return to the Surface**.  
  - Shuffle Davy Jones’ Locker.  
  - Draw **as many cards** as were collected in that turn (including Chest and Key).  
  - Add them to your Hold.

- **Exploration Drone**:  
  - Look at the **top card** of the Loot Deck.  
  - You may choose to **Return to the Surface** (putting the card back) or **Continue Exploring** (placing it in the Exploration and applying its effect).

#### Diver Cards (Optional)  
- Each player has a unique ability that modifies loot card effects.  
- The modified card name is **underlined** on the Diver card.  
- These abilities **override** the base effect of the loot card.  
- Exception: The **Saboteur** does not change loot effects.

#### Variant Cards (Optional)  
- Can be used to modify scoring or gameplay.  
- Chosen before the game begins.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends **after the player who reveals the last card of the Loot Deck** completes their turn (either by incident or returning).  
- Scoring:  
  - For each suit in a player’s Hold, they score **only the highest-value card**.  
  - **Mermaid** cards are worth 4–9; others 2–7.  
- **Victory**:  
  - Highest total score wins.  
  - **Tiebreaker 1**: Most total cards in Hold.  
  - **Tiebreaker 2**: If still tied, players share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I look at Davy Jones’ Locker?**  
  No, unless a card effect (e.g., Treasure Map) allows it.  

- **What if I reveal a card that triggers an effect requiring a card I don’t have?**  
  Ignore the effect (e.g., Net with no cards in Hold).  

- **Can Harpoon target a suit I have, even if I don’t want to?**  
  No. You must choose a suit **you do not have** in your Hold.  

- **Does Anchor save cards if incident is caused by Harpoon/Net?**  
  Yes. Anchor protects cards before it, regardless of incident cause.  

- **If I use Treasure Map and draw a card that causes an incident, does it count?**  
  Yes. The drawn card is added to the Exploration and may trigger an incident immediately.  

- **Can I use Net to play a card from my Hold that causes an incident?**  
  Yes. You **must** do so, even if it causes you to lose everything.
