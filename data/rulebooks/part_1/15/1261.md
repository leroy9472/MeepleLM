## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the bustling city of Medina, players compete as influential builders vying for prestige by constructing and claiming palaces. The objective is to earn the most points by completing palaces, strategically placing supporting structures (stables, walls, and markets), and securing valuable bonus tiles. Each player claims one palace of each of the four colors during the game. Victory is determined by total points from palace size, adjacent features, and bonus tiles.

2. Components  
- Game board depicting a grid of city spaces and outer wall spaces  
- Four sets of colored palace pieces (e.g., red, brown, blue, yellow)  
- Four dome pieces per player (in player colors)  
- Stables (wooden pieces)  
- Inhabitants ("meepees")  
- City wall pieces  
- Four towers (placed in corners)  
- Four palace tiles (numbered 1–4, one per color)  
- Four tower tiles (numbered 1–4, one per tower)  
- Player screens  

3. Setup  
1. Each player chooses a color and takes a screen. Place the 4 colored domes in front of the screen; all other pieces go behind the screen.  
2. Based on player count:  
   - 3 players: Each takes 6 palace pieces, 4 stables, 8 inhabitants, and 10 walls  
   - 4 players: Each takes 5 palace pieces, 3 stables, 6 inhabitants, and 8 walls  
3. Place one tower in each corner of the city wall (on outer, lighter-colored spaces).  
4. Place the 4 tower tiles and 4 palace tiles face up next to the board.  
5. The youngest player places the first inhabitant on any interior space, at least one space away from the city wall.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Play proceeds clockwise.  
2. On a turn, a player must place **two** wooden pieces (any combination of palace, dome, stable, inhabitant, or wall) on legal spaces, following placement rules.  
3. If a player cannot legally place two pieces, they must reveal their remaining pieces to prove they cannot play two, then place as many as possible.  
4. When a player places a dome on a palace, they claim it. Only one player may claim a palace per color.  
5. Once all players have claimed a palace of a given color, all remaining pieces of that color are removed from the game.  
6. When a player runs out of playable pieces, they are eliminated from further turns.  
7. When only one player remains with pieces, they must place one dome per turn (if any remain).  
8. Game ends when all players have no playable pieces.

5. Core Mechanics  

A. Palace Pieces  
- The first piece of a color may be placed on any empty interior or border space **except** wall spaces, and must not be adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to any other palace piece.  
- Subsequent pieces of the same color must be placed **orthogonally adjacent** to an existing piece of that color.  
- Only one incomplete palace of each color may exist at a time.  
- A palace is **complete** (but not claimed) if no legal adjacent placements remain. No further pieces may be added.  
- Once a palace is claimed (via dome), no more palace pieces of that color may be added.  
- After all players have claimed a palace of a given color, all unused pieces of that color are removed from the game.

B. Domes  
- Placing a dome on a palace claims it for the player.  
- Each player may claim only one palace per color.  
- A player may still place palace pieces of a color they’ve already claimed, but cannot claim a second palace of that color.  
- After claiming, the palace is complete: no more palace pieces may be added, but scoring can still increase via adjacent stables, walls, and inhabitants.

C. Stables  
- May be placed on any empty border or interior space **orthogonally adjacent** to a palace piece (completed or not, any owner).  
- Cannot be placed diagonally adjacent.  
- Must not block legal movement—“streets” must remain for inhabitants (no enclosed clusters).  
- Each stable adjacent to a palace adds 1 point to that palace during scoring.  
- Players may place stables next to opponents’ palaces, often to block expansion.

D. Inhabitants (Meepees)  
- Represent markets. The first inhabitant starts the initial market.  
- Subsequent inhabitants must extend an existing string: placed **orthogonally** to one end of the chain.  
- Cannot be placed adjacent to two or more inhabitants (no branching or doubling back).  
- Each inhabitant adjacent to a palace or stable contributes 1 point to that palace’s score.  
- An inhabitant may score for multiple palaces if adjacent to more than one.

E. City Walls  
- May only be placed on designated wall spaces (outer edge).  
- Must be adjacent (orthogonally) to a tower or another city wall.  
- Walls extending from neighboring towers **must not meet**—at least one gap must remain for a city gate.  
- Each wall segment scores 1 point for **each** palace or stable it is orthogonally adjacent to.

F. Palace Tiles  
- One per palace color, numbered 1–4.  
- Awarded to the **first** player who completes (dome) a palace of that color.  
- The tile transfers to any player who later claims a **larger** palace (by total size: palace pieces + attached stables) of the same color.  
- The player holding the tile at game end scores its face value in points.

G. Tower Tiles  
- One per corner tower, numbered 1–4.  
- Awarded when a player claims a palace **adjacent to a city wall segment** connected to that tower.  
- If another player later claims a palace adjacent to a wall connected to the same tower, they **take** the tile, regardless of palace size.  
- A player may gain the tile if:  
  - They claim a palace adjacent to a wall connected to the tower.  
  - A wall is later placed adjacent to their claimed palace and connected to the tower.  
  - A stable is placed adjacent to their claimed palace, which is adjacent to a wall connected to the tower.  
- Once a player is connected to a tower via wall or stable, **further placements do not re-trigger** tile transfer.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends when all players have exhausted their playable pieces.  
Scoring per player, per palace:  
- 1 point per palace piece  
- 1 point per stable orthogonally adjacent to the palace  
- 1 point per city wall segment orthogonally adjacent to the palace or any of its stables  
- 1 point per inhabitant orthogonally adjacent to the palace or any of its stables (an inhabitant may score for multiple palaces)  
- Palace tiles: face value (1–4) for each held at game end  
- Tower tiles: face value (1–4) for each held at game end  

Total score = sum across all four palaces and tiles.  
Highest score wins. Ties result in shared victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I place palace pieces of a color I’ve already claimed?  
  A: Yes, but you cannot claim a second palace of that color.  

- Q: What if I can only place one piece?  
  A: Place one. If you cannot place any, reveal your pieces to prove it.  

- Q: Can two walls from adjacent towers touch?  
  A: No. There must always be at least one gap between wall segments for a gate.  

- Q: Can a stable be adjacent to multiple palaces?  
  A: Yes. It will contribute 1 point to each adjacent palace’s score.  

- Q: Does an inhabitant in the middle of a chain score?  
  A: Only if placed adjacent to a palace or stable. Only the ends can be extended.  

- Q: Can I claim a palace that is only 1 piece?  
  A: Yes. Size does not matter for claiming—only dome placement.  

- Q: If I lose a palace tile due to someone building a larger palace, do I lose the points?  
  A: Yes. Only the current holder of the tile scores its value.  

- Q: Can I place a wall not connected to a tower if it's adjacent to another wall?  
  A: Only if that wall is ultimately connected to a tower. All walls must form a chain back to a tower.
