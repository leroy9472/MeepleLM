# Hamburgum — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 17th-century Hamburg, players guide influential families in pursuit of wealth and prestige. The city’s skyline is dominated by towering churches and bustling ships—symbols of prosperity. While players produce goods, build ships, and construct buildings, only **Prestige Points (PP)** determine victory. Prestige is earned primarily through **church donations**, with final scoring triggered when all six churches are completed.

**Objective**: Be the first to complete actions that culminate in the completion of the sixth church. At game end, score PP from donation tokens, goods, and money. The player with the most PP wins. Ties are broken by leftover money.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### **Production (Beer, Sugar, Cloth)**  
- Base production: 1 unit per good type.  
- +1 per matching **Production Building** owned (Brewer, Sugar Refiner, Cloth Maker).  
- No cost. Take goods directly from bank.  
- **Price Effect**: Each Production Building built lowers its good’s price by 10£ on price chart (immediate and permanent).

#### **Trade**  
May **sell goods** OR **buy materials**, **not both**.  

**Sell Goods**:  
- **Via Ships**:  
  - Each ship carries one good type.  
  - Max units = berth number:  
    - Berth 3: 3 units  
    - Berth 2: 2 units  
    - Berth 1: 1 unit  
  - Earn value from **price chart**.  
- **Direct Sale**:  
  - Excess goods beyond ship capacity may be sold to bank for **30£ each**, no ship or price chart used.  
- Sold goods return to bank. Ships do not move or reload.

**Buy Materials**:  
- Buy any combination of: Timber, Bricks, Church Bells.  
- Cost based on **Depot Price Table** (e.g., 1 unit = 20£, 5 units = 200£, 10 units = 600£).  
- **Limit**: Only **1 Church Bell per player** at any time.  
- Supply is unlimited (use scoring track to track overflow).

#### **Dockyard — Build Ships**  
- Cost: 1 Timber per ship.  
- New ship starts in **Berth 3**.  
- **Berth Capacity**: Each berth holds up to **number of players** ships.  
- **Berth Advancement Rule**:  
  - If Berth 3 is **full** and a new ship is added:  
    1. Ships in Berth 1 → returned to owner’s supply  
    2. Ships in Berth 2 → moved to Berth 1  
    3. Ships in Berth 3 → moved to Berth 2  
    4. New ship → placed in Berth 3  
  - Players may reuse ships removed from Berth 1 in same turn.  
- **Flying Dutchman (Captain Building)**: Neutral ship placed in Berth 3; moves like player ships, removed when exiting Berth 1.

#### **Church Action**  
Two optional steps, in order:  

**1. Make Donations** (to **one** church only):  
- May make multiple donations in one turn.  
- Cost per donation:  
  - 1st: 1 Brick  
  - 2nd: 1 Brick + 1 Timber  
  - 3rd: 1 Brick + 1 Timber + 20£  
  - 4th: 1 Brick + 1 Timber + 40£  
  - 5th: 1 Brick + 1 Timber + 1 Bell + **10£ per citizen you control**  
- For each donation:  
  - Pay cost to bank.  
  - Place your disk on church site.  
  - Take one donation token (point-side up).  
  - **1st donation to any church**: must take **5 PP token**.  
  - Subsequent donations: choose freely from remaining 4 token types.  

**Church Completion (5th donation)**:  
- Remove all disks from site.  
- Move top church from **Church Builder Bonus Chart** to site.  
- Earn **bonus PP** (8 for 1st completed, 7 for 2nd, ..., 3 for 6th).  
- Place your disk on bonus chart → become **Church Builder**.  
  - **Effect**: Ignore adjacency rules for future building.  

**2. Score Donation Tokens**  
- May score **any number** of your tokens (even if no donation made this turn).  
- Scoring effects (per token):  
  - **5 PP**: Always first token; worth 5 PP.  
  - **Donation Count**: 1 PP × total donation tokens you own (scored or not).  
  - **Ships**: 2 PP × number of **your ships in harbor at time of scoring**.  
  - **Buildings**:  
    - 5 PP (if 4–5 buildings of matching type)  
    - 4 PP (if 2–3)  
  - **Citizens**:  
    - 3 PP (if 3–4 in church’s district)  
    - 4 PP (if 5+)  
    - **Cathedral exception**: 1 PP per citizen **anywhere** on board.  
- **Scoring Procedure**:  
  - Apply PP, advance score marker.  
  - Flip token **face down** (church side up).  
- **End of Action Rule**: You may have **at most one un-scored token per type**. If you have duplicates, **must score at least one**.

#### **Guildhall — Build Buildings**  
- Cost per building: 1 Timber + 1 Brick.  
- Place citizen on building site.  
- **Adjacency Rule**:  
  - Must build adjacent to:  
    - A church you’ve donated to (disk present or scored token), OR  
    - One of your citizens (even placed this turn).  
  - **Exception**: Church Builders (completed a church) ignore adjacency.  
- **Multiple Buildings**: May build multiple per turn, but:  
  - Only **one Official** per turn.  
  - May use newly placed citizens/buildings to satisfy adjacency.  

**Building Effects**:  

**Production Buildings (Brewer, Sugar Refiner, Cloth Maker)**:  
- Increase production of matching good by 1.  
- Each built: lower good’s price by 10£ on chart.  

**Other Buildings**:  
- **Merchant (3)**: +100£  
- **Captain (3)**:  
  - Place one **Flying Dutchman** in Berth 3.  
  - Then place one of your ships in Berth 3.  
- **Officials** (only top of stack available):  
  - **Councilman**: +10£ per **total citizen in all districts** (all players, including new one).  
  - **Vicar**: +10£ per **total donation tokens owned by all players** (scored or not).  
  - **Lord Mayor**: +60£ per **completed church** (any player).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Trigger**: Game ends **immediately** when **6th church is completed**.  

**Final Scoring Steps**:  
1. **Score all un-scored donation tokens** (same rules as Church action).  
2. **Sell all remaining**:  
   - Goods (Beer, Sugar, Cloth): 50£ each  
   - Building Materials (Timber, Bricks, Bells): 50£ each  
3. **Convert Money to PP**:  
   - Trade in **every 100£** for **1 PP** (leftover £ does not carry over).  
4. **Total PP** = Score track + converted money.  

**Winner**: Player with **most PP**.  
**Tiebreaker**: Most leftover money.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I score tokens without donating?**  
  Yes. Scoring is independent of donation in same turn.  

- **Can I score multiple tokens of same type?**  
  Only if you have only one un-scored. After scoring, you may hold only one per type.  

- **Can I sell goods and buy materials on same turn?**  
  No. Trade action allows **only one**: sell OR buy.  

- **Are materials limited?**  
  Only **ships (5/player)** and **bells (1/player)**. All else unlimited (use scoring track to track shortages).  

- **Can I pass or skip action?**  
  No. Must perform full action if possible.  

- **Can I build without donating?**  
  No. Must have at least one donation (or be Church Builder) to satisfy adjacency.  

- **Can I use a scored token for adjacency?**  
  Yes. A scored (face-down) donation token still counts as a donation for adjacency.  

- **Do ships lose value when moved?**  
  No. Ships always sell at price chart value based on good type, regardless of berth.  

- **Can I have multiple Church Builders?**  
  Yes. Each player who completes a church becomes a Church Builder.
