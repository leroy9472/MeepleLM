### 3. Setup
**Main Board Setup:**
1. Place the main board in the center.
2. Randomly place 8 Pilgrimage Track Tiles on the 4 tracks (2 per track), with Season icons oriented so the blank side faces the center.
3. Sort Ecosystem Cards into 4 decks by color. Shuffle each deck and place face-up by requirement: red (3 Biomes) → yellow (4) → teal (5) → purple (6), left to right.
4. Place 1 random Bonus Tile on each top space of the Borderlands.
5. Place all Creatures in the supply above the Borderlands.
6. Place both halves of each Biome Tile on the "0" spot of the Biome Reserve.
7. Place 1 random Season Tile on each Season Track.
8. Place the Sun Tracker on the Sun Track based on player count (e.g., 2-player: spot "2").

**Player Setup:**
1. Each player takes:
   - Player Board and matching components (8 cubes, 2 Elder, 1 Young Villager in Supply; 2 Young, 3 Veteran in Reserve)
   - 1 Starting Ecosystem Card (randomly assigned)
2. Place:
   - 1 cube on each Sage Gift space
   - Spirit Tracker: 1st player at "0", 2nd at "2", 3rd at "4", etc.
   - 1 cube at start of each Season Track
   - RP Tracker at "0" and "000"
3. Starting with the last player, each places 1 Villager (Elder or Young) on any Pilgrimage Track, then advances that track 1 space (no Season activation during setup).

**Solo Mode Setup (vs. Feronia):**
1. Choose Feronia’s difficulty (2–7).
2. Give Feronia:
   - Solo Player Board
   - 5 Elder, 1 Young, 1 Veteran Villager
   - 2 RP Trackers (at "0" and "000")
   - 1 card from each Ecosystem deck: 3-Biome (left), 4-Biome (middle), 5- and 6-Biome stacked (right, 5 on top)
3. Shuffle Solo Deck and place beside her board.
4. Feronia places first:
   - Draw top Solo Card
   - Place Feronia’s Villager on track labeled "1"
   - Advance that track 1 space
5. Then place your starting Villager normally.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn, follow these steps in order:

**Step 1: Pilgrimage**
- Choose one:
  - **Place 1 Villager** on an empty space below the "Place Villager" icon on any track (from your Supply only).
    - If placed on a Season icon, advance your Season Tracker 1 space.
  - **Advance 1 Pilgrimage Track** 1 space toward the center.
    - All players may move any of their Villagers from that track to the start of any trail they’ve passed or are adjacent to (order: most advanced first).
    - If the "Swap" icon appears after movement, swap the inner and outer track tiles (Villagers must leave before swap).
- Optionally, pay Spirit to repeat one of the above:
  - 2-player: pay 2 Spirit
  - 3–5 player: pay 3 Spirit

**Step 2: Activate Villagers**
- Activate up to 2 Villagers for free.
- Activate a 3rd by paying 2 Spirit.
- When activating, follow the trail from start to end, resolving all icons in order.
- Icons include: Regenerate Biome, Take Ecosystem Card, Invite Creature, Gift Sage, Attract Creature, Refresh Cards, Convert Biome, Gain/Lose Spirit, Train Villager, Sage Rewards, Return Villager.

**Step 3: Complete 1 Ecosystem Card**
- Spend required Biomes from the Biome Reserve (slide top halves down).
- Water acts as a wild Biome, but only if the required Biome is at 0.
- Gain rewards (Spirit, Creatures, etc.).
- Flip card and place beside your board (add to Ecosystem later).

**Step 4: Update Biome Reserve & Advance Tracks**
- Move bottom halves of all Biomes up to meet their top halves.
- Gain RP for each space moved through or landed on.
- Advance each Pilgrimage Track that has your Villagers:
  - Each Elder or Young: +1 space
  - Each Veteran: +2 spaces
- After each track moves, players may move their Villagers to trail starts.

**End of Turn:**
- During the next player’s turn, add your completed Ecosystem Card (if any) to your Ecosystem, then place all Invited Creatures.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Villager Placement:** Only from Supply; one per track space.
- **Track Movement:** Advances Villagers; triggers trail access.
- **Biome Management:** Generated via icons; spent to complete cards; unspent Biomes score RP.
- **Ecosystem Building:**
  - Cards must align by habitat edges.
  - Can be rotated and stacked (but not fully covered).
  - Must leave at least one Habitat visible per card.
- **Creature Placement:**
  - Place at intersections of 4 Habitats.
  - No orthogonally adjacent Creatures.
  - Can place from Invited or Captivity (1 from Captivity per turn if placing from Invited).
- **Water as Wild:** Can substitute for any Biome that is at 0.
- **Solo AI (Feronia):**
  - Uses Solo Deck to determine actions.
  - Places up to 2 Villagers per turn (prioritizing Season icons).
  - Activates all on-trail Villagers.
  - Completes leftmost possible Ecosystem Card.
  - Uses private Water from Ecosystem Track if public Biomes insufficient.
  - Unspent Biomes score RP.
  - Veteran Villager on RP track advances for various achievements (Creatures, cards, unactivated Villagers).
  - Final score = RP from Biomes + (Veteran VP × Difficulty level).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Game End:**
- Triggered when Sun Tracker reaches the final space.
- All players (including the one who triggered it) take 2 more turns.
- Then proceed to final scoring.

**Final Scoring (Player):**
1. **Captivity Penalty:** Lose 3 Spirit per Creature in Captivity.
2. **Spirit Track:** Adjust RP based on Spirit Tracker position.
3. **Seasons (Left to Right):**
   - Score base RP for meeting condition (max 8 per Season).
   - Multiply by your Season Tracker level (max ×6).
4. **Creatures:**
   - Mushfrog: 3 RP per adjacent Tree
   - Antlerworm: 3 RP per adjacent Coral
   - Spiderant: 2 RP per different adjacent Habitat
   - Wiseowl: 2 RP per adjacent Mushroom + 1 RP per 2 total Gifts (rounded down)
   - Grimster: 2 RP per adjacent Flower + 3 RP per orthogonally aligned Mushfrog
   - Tailcat: 2 RP per adjacent Weed + 3 RP per orthogonally aligned Antlerworm
   - **Water Bonus:** Any Creature with ≥1 adjacent Water doubles its total RP.
5. **Tiebreakers:**
   - Most Creatures in Ecosystem
   - Most Spirit
   - Most total Season Track progress

**Feronia’s Final Scoring:**
- RP from unspent Biomes during game
- Veteran Villager advances for:
  - Each Invited Creature
  - Each Completed Ecosystem Card
  - Every 2 cards in rightmost slot (rounded down)
  - Each unactivated Villager at trail start
- Final Score = Biome RP + (Veteran VP × Difficulty)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I place a Villager on a track space already occupied?** No. Only one Villager per space.
- **Can I activate more than 3 Villagers?** No. Max 3 per turn (3rd costs 2 Spirit).
- **Can I complete more than 1 Ecosystem Card per turn?** No. Only 1.
- **Can I use Water as wild if the Biome is not at 0?** No. Only if the required Biome is at 0.
- **Can I cover a Creature completely with a card?** No. Must leave it partially visible.
- **Can I move a previously placed card?** No. Cards cannot be moved once placed.
- **Do Fish/Sprites count as Creatures?** No. They do not trigger Sun Tracker or score for Creature-based Season Goals.
- **Can Feronia use her private Water first?** No. She uses public Biomes first, only using her track if necessary.
- **What if all Ecosystem decks are empty?** Cannot take new cards. Refresh only if decks exist.
- **Can I ignore a “Place Villager” icon effect?** Yes. You may choose to ignore it when activating.
