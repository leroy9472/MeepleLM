### 1. Lore & Objective
Thunderbolt Apache Leader is a tactical combat simulation where players command a squadron of aircraft to destroy enemy battalions across a battlefield. The primary objective is to eliminate enemy threats before they overrun friendly sectors, while managing resources, pilot stress, and aircraft damage. Victory is achieved by accumulating Victory Points (VPs) through destroying or reducing enemy battalions, completing special missions, and minimizing losses.

### 2. Components
- Aircraft and Pilot cards
- Battalion cards and counters
- Enemy unit counters (vehicles, infantry, SAMs, AAA, helicopters)
- Weapon and ordnance counters (rockets, bombs, missiles, fuel tanks, ECM pods)
- Terrain hexes
- Mission Event and Special Condition decks
- Player Log, SO Point tracker, Day tracker
- Loiter Track and Bingo Fuel markers
- Hit counters (Ground Forces and Air)
- Scout counters
- Stress, Damage, and Status markers

### 3. Setup
1. **Choose Campaign & Situation**: Select a Campaign card and Situation card. Note starting SO Points and number of Days.
2. **Gather Terrain**: Collect the 10 terrain hexes listed on the Campaign card.
3. **Draw Battalions**: Draw from decks in order: Assault, Assault, Support, Command, repeating as needed. Stop when cumulative VP meets or exceeds the Campaign Setup value.
4. **Place Battalions**: Position counters on the Sector Map:
   - Assault in Front (A)
   - Support in Transit (S)
   - Command in Rear (C)
5. **Buy Aircraft**: Purchase aircraft with service year ≤ Campaign year. Total cost must not exceed starting SO Points.
6. **Buy Scouts**: Each costs 1 SO Point. Available once per day.
7. **Select Pilots**: Assign 1 Average pilot per aircraft + 1 extra per aircraft type. Adjust skill levels using zero-sum trades.
8. **Promote Pilots (Optional)**: Spend 1 SO Point per skill level increase.
9. **Finalize Setup**: Place SO and Day counters. Shuffle Mission Event and Special Condition decks.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
**Start of Day**
- Draw Special Condition card (affects all missions).
- Choose one or more battalions to attack (each = one mission).
- Assign aircraft and pilots to missions.
- Allocate scouts (1 per mission).
- Select first mission.

**Mission Resolution (per mission)**
1. **Target-Bound Phase**
   - Decide to abort (no stress, no No-Fly Recovery).
   - Arm aircraft: weapons, ECM, fuel tanks within weight and ordnance point (OP) limits.
   - Pay 1 SO per 10 OPs (rounded up); optional 1 SO to negate range band weight penalty.
   - Draw Target-Bound Mission Event (top half).
   - Engine Damage Check: 1d10 ≤ 2 → crash.
   - Place terrain hexes randomly (arrows up).
   - Place enemy units: roll 1d10 for each; half-strength battalions use half units.
   - Place friendly aircraft on edge hexes; set altitude and initial position.
   - Scout Success Check: roll 1d10, consult table.
   - Set Loiter Track: default 5 turns; +2 per fuel tank; modified by scouts and battalion effects.

2. **Battlefield Resolution Phase (per Loiter Turn)**
   - **Pop-Up Draw**: 1 per high-altitude aircraft (excludes AC-130, RQ-1, MQs).
   - **Enemy Cover Roll**: 1d10; units move to ridge edge if possible (not buildings).
   - **Fast Aircraft Turn** (Speed 2+ or RQ-1/MQ at H)
     - Altitude: choose H/L.
     - Movement: move 1 hex per speed point; hover-capable may hover.
     - Ridge Evasion: at L altitude, roll 1d10 per ridge; +1 per Evasive, −1 per Stress.
     - Attack: once per turn, before/during/after move.
   - **Enemy Helicopters Move**: if in LOS but not attack range, move 1 hex closer.
   - **Enemy Units Attack**: each targets closest eligible aircraft; declare all, then resolve.
   - **Slow Aircraft Turn** (Speed 1 or 0, not fast)
     - Repeat Fast Aircraft actions.
   - **End of Turn**: Reduce Loiter Track by 1.
     - At “0”: place Bingo 6+ marker.
     - At “−1”: flip to Bingo 10+.
     - At “−2”: aircraft crash.

   Repeat until no aircraft remain or mission ends.

3. **Home-Bound Phase**
   - Evaluate battalion:
     - **Destroyed**: remaining unit value ≤ second bracket → remove counter, gain full VPs.
     - **Reduced**: ≤ first bracket → flip counter, gain ½ VPs (round down).
     - **Full**: > first bracket → no VPs.
   - Draw Home-Bound Mission Event (bottom half).
   - Bingo Fuel Check: for each Bingo marker, roll 1d10; if < number, gain Stress = difference.
   - SAR for Crashed Aircraft: roll 1d10; modifiers: +2 (Target-Bound crash), +1 (Home-Bound), +1 per sacrificed WP.
   - Record:
     - **Stress**: based on range band; reduce by Cool.
     - **XP**: 1 for flying; +1 if battalion destroyed; +1 if all units destroyed.
     - **Promotions**: if XP ≥ requirement, promote pilot.
     - **Damage**: record lasting damage (structure, engine, etc.).
     - **VPs**: from mission, destroyed aircraft (−1 VP), killed pilots (−1 VP).

**End of Day**
- **No-Fly Recovery**: non-flying pilots lose 2 Stress + Cool.
- **Gain SO Points**: from Situation card; +1 per 5 Transport points (cargo runs).
- **Move Battalions**: roll 1d10 per non-Fixed battalion; consult movement table.
- **SO Penalties**: −1 SO per battalion in Friendly Rear; −3 SO per in Air Base. Cannot pay → loss.
- **Replace & Repair**:
   - Aircraft: 2 VP to replace; salvage parts (HUD, Display, etc.) if not crashed.
   - Pilots: 1 VP to replace (same skill).
   - Repair: 1 SO per damage counter.
   - Priority R&R: spend 2 SO to remove 2 + Cool Stress from all pilots.
- Advance Day counter. If final day, check VP total vs Campaign card.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Line of Sight (LOS)**: Trace center-to-center through hexes. Ridges block LOS at Low Altitude.
- **Attack Resolution**: 1d10 ≥ Attack Number (modified by pilot skill, target DRM, shaken). 1 hit = destroy unit.
- **Hit Counters**: Draw based on enemy attack number.
  - **ECM Pod**: negate attack on 7+.
  - **Evasive Skill**: cancel 1 Light Hit or reduce Heavy to Light.
  - **Types**: 
    - Instant (Stress, Killed, No Effect)
    - Temporary (Attack −1, No Hover, etc.)
    - Lasting (*marked): structure, engine, HUD, etc.
- **Loiter & Fuel**: Track mission duration. Bingo checks at end.
- **Linked Aircraft**: AH-64D, A-10C, MQ-1, RQ-1 share LOS across ridges.
- **Air Assault Missions**: Drawn from Special Condition deck. Use Air Assault soldiers to complete objectives (Eliminate, Rescue, etc.). Must extract survivors.
- **Cargo Missions**: Use Transport aircraft. Gain 1 SO per 5 Transport points. Pilot gains 0 Stress.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Points**:
  - Battalion destroyed: full VP.
  - Battalion reduced: ½ VP (round down); gain remainder if later destroyed.
  - −1 VP per crashed manned aircraft.
  - −1 VP per killed pilot.
  - Bonuses from mission success, objectives.
- **End Game**: After final day or all battalions resolved.
- **Victory Condition**: Compare total VPs to Campaign card’s thresholds (e.g., Flee, Defeat, Victory, etc.).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Abort Mission**: Aircraft and pilots locked; no stress, no recovery.
- **Friendly Fire**: Mk.20 in hex with Air Assault soldiers: roll attacks, subtract pilot’s Skill.
- **Unmanned Aircraft**: No stress from bullet holes, wounded, HUD; killed hit = crash.
- **Engine Damage**: Check only during Target-Bound if unrepaired.
- **Scout Lost**: Place on Day counter; repair/replacement at End of Day.
- **Pilot Promotion**: Apply immediately; recheck Cool and Stress.
- **AC-130**: Ignores altitude hits, pylon, HUD; no pop-ups; left-side attacks only.
- **RQ-1**: All pilots fast at H; no VP loss if crashed; can act as scout.
