## Trans America – Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Trans America is a strategic railway-building game where players compete to connect cities and score points. The goal is to be the first to connect all five destination cities on your card and advance your locomotive along the scoring track. The game ends when a player's locomotive passes the barrier; the player with the highest score at that point wins.

2. Components  
- Game board with city locations and track lines (single and double)  
- Wooden track pieces (rails) in player colors  
- Locomotive tokens (one per player)  
- Cylinder markers (one per player)  
- City cards (35 total, 7 of each color: red, orange, yellow, green, blue)  
- Barrier marker  
- Action track (in solo variant)  
- White cylinder (region sequence marker)  
- Train card (indicates current position in solo variant)

3. Setup  
- Place the board in the center.  
- Each player chooses a color and takes the corresponding locomotive, cylinder, and 5 wooden track pieces.  
- Place each player’s cylinder in the engine shed.  
- Place the barrier on the red double line at the end of the main track.  
- For 2–3 players: remove 10 city cards (2 of each color); these will not be used.  
- Shuffle the remaining city cards and place them face down on the board.  
- Each player draws 5 city cards — one of each color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue).  
- Choose a starting player by any agreed method.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- The game is played in rounds.  
- On a player’s turn:  
  - Place 1 or 2 track segments on empty lines connected to your existing network.  
    - On a single line: place 1 or 2 rails.  
    - On a double line (river/mountain): place only 1 rail per turn.  
  - Track must connect to your current network (originating from your starting point).  
  - Players may connect to other players’ networks and use them as part of their own.  
  - If placing 2 rails, they may be placed on different connected parts of your network.  
- Play proceeds clockwise.  
- A round ends when one or more players successfully connect all 5 of their destination cities.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Starting a Network: The starting player places their first track at any empty intersection or city; all subsequent track must connect to this.  
- Track Placement Rules:  
  - Only place track on empty lines.  
  - Must be connected to your existing network.  
  - Double lines cost 1 rail per turn (cannot place 2 rails on a double line in one turn).  
- Shared Networks:  
  - Players may connect to others’ tracks and use the combined network.  
  - This allows indirect routing through opponents’ lines.  
- Completion Check: After each turn, check if any player has connected all 5 cities.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- When a player connects all 5 cities, the round ends immediately.  
- Scoring for incomplete networks:  
  - For each missing rail on a single line: -1 point  
  - For each missing rail on a double line: -2 points  
- Players may choose the most favorable path for scoring.  
- Each negative point moves the player’s locomotive one space toward the barrier.  
- Locomotives may occupy the same space and pass each other.  
- After the second round:  
  - If the lowest-scoring player has 4 or more points, move the barrier 2 spaces ahead of that player’s locomotive.  
- Game ends when any player’s locomotive passes the barrier.  
- Winner: The player with the most points (i.e., highest position on the scoring track) wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I start building from multiple points?  
  A: No. All track must connect to your initial network.  
- Q: Can I place 2 rails on a double line in one turn?  
  A: No. Only 1 rail may be placed per turn on double lines.  
- Q: What if two players complete their network on the same turn?  
  A: The round ends; both are scored as complete (0 penalty).  
- Q: Can I skip connecting to my own track?  
  A: No. All placements must extend from your current network.  
- Q: Can I go through a city not on my card?  
  A: Yes, as long as it helps connect your cities.
