## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Use strategy, skill, timing, and a little luck to score the most stars (♣) over three rounds. Each player controls a ball on a shared pinball table, making independent choices each turn based on a shared dice roll. The game ends when all players complete their third round. The player with the most stars wins. Ties are broken by earliest completion of the third round; if still tied, victory is shared.

### 2. Components  
- **Four Pinball Tables (Pins)**: Carniball (Easy), Cyberhack (Moderate), Dragonslayer (Moderate), Dance Fever (Advanced)  
  - Each Pin includes a Table and Backglass card  
- **Two six-sided dice**  
- **Eight ball tokens** (2 per player)  
- **Four dry-erase markers** (1 per player)  

---

### 3. Setup  
Each player:  
1. Takes a matching Table and Backglass card (all players use the same Pin per game).  
2. Takes 2 ball tokens and 1 dry-erase marker.  
3. Places one ball token on the Start Arrow.  
4. Keeps the second ball token nearby for Multiball.  
5. Fills the Round 1 circle on the Round Track.  

**Tip**: New players should start with Carniball.

Place dice in the center. All players share the same dice roll each turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of **three rounds** per player. Players act simultaneously but independently.

**Each turn has three steps**:  
1. **Roll the Dice**: One player rolls two dice. All players see both results.  
2. **Move Your Ball**: Each player chooses one die result and moves their ball to a feature with that number in an unfilled box.  
   - Normally, move to a lower zone.  
   - If on a Flipper, may move up to a higher zone (color restrictions apply).  
3. **Fill a Box**: Fill an unfilled box matching the chosen die result. Collect stars (♣) and trigger bonuses.  

After all players complete their turn, return to Step 1.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Zones  
Tables are divided into zones. Movement is typically downward. Skipping zones is allowed.

#### Flippers  
- **Yellow Flipper**: Ball may return to any feature with yellow or white die faces.  
- **Red Flipper**: Ball may return to any feature with red or white die faces.  
- From a Flipper, you may move to any higher zone (not just the top).  

#### Inlanes (● ●)  
- Fill an Inlane box → score 2 stars and immediately move ball to the adjacent Flipper **without filling a Flipper box**.  

#### Outlanes (□ □)  
- Filling an Outlane scores 2 stars per filled Red or Yellow Flipper box.  
- The ball is then lost.  
- If no balls remain, the round ends.  

#### Nudging  
- Spend a Nudge (double-line box) to change one die result.  
- Write the **difference** in the Nudge Amount box.  
- Nudge only affects you; dice are not physically changed.  
- **Cannot Nudge** if it would cause a ball loss.  
- **Can Nudge** to avoid ball loss.  

#### Tilt  
- After a Nudge, on the **next roll**, if the difference between the two dice is **less than** the Nudge Amount → **Tilt!**  
- Round ends immediately; all ball tokens are lost.  
- Erase Nudge Amount after the roll, regardless of outcome.  
- **Cannot use Skill Shots to avoid Tilt.**

#### Skill Shot  
- Earned by completing certain Sets (e.g., Ferris Wheel Cars in Carniball).  
- Circle a number (1–6) on the Table.  
- Later, use that number as a die result by erasing the circle.  
- Multiple Skill Shots can be stored.  
- Skill Shot does not affect other players.  
- Can combine with Nudge (e.g., use Skill Shot, then Nudge further).  

#### Multiball  
- Triggered by certain Drop Target bonuses.  
- Place second ball on Start Arrow.  
- On next roll, assign each die to one ball (cannot use same die for both).  
- Resolve one ball fully before the other.  
- **During Multiball**: All scores are doubled (except in Dance Fever’s DISCO PINFERNO).  
- Multiball ends when you start a turn with fewer than 2 active balls.  
- Cannot re-trigger Multiball while active.  

#### Box Types (Erasure Rules)  
- **Solid Line**: Erase when entire Set is complete.  
- **Dashed Line**: Erase at end of round.  
- **Double Line**: Never erase; use once per game.  

#### Sets  
- Groups of features (Bumpers, Drop Targets, etc.).  
- Completing all boxes in a Set:  
  - Triggers a bonus.  
  - Erase all boxes in the Set (except double-line).  
- Bonuses with ∞ can be taken multiple times; others only once per game.  

##### Bumper Sets  
- Filling all 12 Bumper boxes → erase and reuse.  
- Arrows allow movement between Bumpers (direction depends on Pin and bonuses).  

##### Drop Target Sets  
- Completing a Set → choose one bonus.  
- Examples: Multiball, Flipper Pass, Score Stars, etc.  

##### Spinner Sets  
- Ball passes through Spinner when moving up from a Flipper.  
- Fill the box matching the **unused die** → score that many stars.  
- If all 6 boxes filled → erase the Set.  

##### Combination Boxes  
- Boxes showing multiple die faces (e.g., “3/4”) can be filled with either number.  
- Fill the entire box with one use.  

#### Losing a Ball & Ending a Round  
A ball is lost if:  
- You move to Flipper Zone but cannot fill a box.  
- You fill an Outlane.  
- You Tilt.  

**When a ball is lost**:  
- If you have a second ball (Multiball), continue.  
- If no balls remain:  
  1. Erase all **dashed-line** boxes.  
  2. Fill next circle on Round Track.  
  3. Place one ball on Start Arrow.  
  4. Begin next round on next roll.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Stars (♣) are scored by filling boxes, completing Sets, or triggering bonuses.  
- Track stars on Backglass from 1 to 100.  
  - 100 stars = fill a hundreds space; reset star track.  
- Blue stars (★) (e.g., in Dragonslayer) score only under specific conditions.  

**End of Game**:  
- Game ends when all players complete their **third round**.  
- Compare total stars.  
- **Tiebreaker**:  
  1. Player who finished third round earliest wins.  
  2. If still tied, victory is shared.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use the same die as another player?** Yes. Each player independently chooses which die to use.  
- **Can I stay on the same feature?** No. Must move to a different box or zone.  
- **Can I move between Flippers?** Yes, if an unfilled box exists and movement rules allow.  
- **Can I use a Skill Shot and Nudge together?** Yes. Example: Use Skill Shot to get 5, then Nudge down to 4.  
- **Can I trigger Multiball multiple times?** Only after losing a ball; cannot stack.  
- **Do bonuses carry between rounds?** No. All dashed-line boxes and temporary bonuses (e.g., Flipper Pass) end at round end.  
- **Can I choose not to move?** No. You must use one die and move if possible. If not, ball is lost.
