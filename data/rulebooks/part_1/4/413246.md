## BOMBBUSTERS — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Bomb Busters is a cooperative real-time deduction game where players take on the roles of bomb disposal experts working together to defuse a series of increasingly complex bombs. Each mission presents unique constraints and challenges. The team wins by successfully cutting all wires without triggering an explosion. The bomb explodes—and the mission fails—if:  
- A red wire is cut.  
- The detonator dial reaches the final space (marked with a skull).  

The objective is to complete all 66 missions, progressing through increasingly difficult challenges that introduce new mechanics, restrictions, and equipment.

### 3. Setup  

#### General Setup  
1. **Choose a Mission Card**: Missions are numbered 1–66 and increase in difficulty. Start with 1–8 for training.  
2. **Designate the Captain**: Randomly choose the first Captain. Place the Captain character card in front of them. Other players choose any remaining character card.  
3. **Distribute Tile Stands**:  
   - 2 players: Each uses 2 tile stands  
   - 3 players: Captain uses 2; others use 1  
   - 4–5 players: Each uses 1  
4. **Prepare Wire Tiles**:  
   - A. Use all 48 blue wires (except in Missions 1–3, which may restrict usage).  
   - B. Draw red/yellow wires as specified on the Mission card (randomly).  
   - C. Place red/yellow markers on the board to indicate possible values:  
     - If the mission says “1 out of 2” or “2 out of 3”, reveal that many tiles, place “?”-side-up markers for each, shuffle, include only the required number in play, and discard the rest unseen.  
   - D. Shuffle all wire tiles (blue + red + yellow) facedown.  
5. **Deal Wires**:  
   - Deal wires equally and facedown to tile stands.  
   - Players place wires faceup in front of their stand, sorted left to right in ascending order (using decimal values only for sorting).  
   - A player with two stands manages both as one hand.  
6. **Equipment Setup**:  
   - Place as many Equipment cards faceup (green side down) as there are players. Unused cards are set aside.  
   - Equipment becomes usable when 2 wires of the number shown on the card have been cut. Slide up to reveal green checkmark.  
7. **Detonator Dial**: Set to the starting position based on player count (as indicated on board).  
8. **Info Tokens**: Place all Info and Validation tokens near the board.  
9. **Place Info Tokens (Setup Action)**:  
   - Starting with Captain and going clockwise, each player places **one** Info token in front of a blue wire in their hand (not yellow).  
   - If a player has two stands, they still place only one Info token (on one stand of their choice).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

Players take turns clockwise, starting with the Captain. On their turn, the active bomb disposal expert must perform **one** of the following actions:

#### 1. Dual Cut Action  
- Announce a value (e.g., “This is a 7”) and point to **one** wire in a **teammate’s** stand.  
- You must have a wire of the same value in your own hand.  
- **Success (✓)**:  
  - The teammate’s wire matches your announced value (and is not red).  
  - Both players place the matching wire faceup in front of their stand.  
- **Failure (×)**:  
  - If the wire is **red**: **Bomb explodes** → mission lost.  
  - If the wire is **blue or yellow**:  
    - Detonator dial advances one notch.  
    - Teammate places an Info token revealing the wire’s true value.  

**Solo Cut Exception**:  
- If all remaining wires of a given value are in your hand (and you have 2 or 4 of them), you may perform a **Solo Cut** instead:  
  - Reveal and place faceup the 2 or 4 matching wires from your hand.  
  - No teammate involvement needed.  
  - Cannot cut 3 wires—you must wait until a pair is reduced to 2 or 4.  

#### 2. Solo Cut Action  
- Only allowed when you hold the last 2 or 4 uncut wires of a single value.  
- Reveal and place all matching wires faceup in front of your stand.  
- No detonator movement.  

#### 3. Reveal Your Red Wires Action  
- Only allowed when **all your remaining uncut wires are red**.  
- Reveal all red wires by placing them faceup in front of your stand.  
- No detonator movement.  

#### Equipment Use  
- Equipment cards become available when **2 wires of the number in the top-left corner** have been cut.  
- Slide card up to reveal green checkmark.  
- Can be used **once per mission**; flip facedown after use.  
- Most equipment can be used **at any time**, even out of turn.  
- Multiple equipment can be used in sequence.  

**Key Equipment Mechanics**:  
- **Double Detector (Char Card)**: Point to **2 wires** in a teammate’s stand. Action succeeds if **at least one** matches your announced value.  
  - If both match, teammate chooses which to cut.  
  - If one is red, bomb **does not explode**; teammate places Info token on the non-red wire.  
  - Cannot say “one is yellow” — must announce a number 1–12.  
- **Triple Detector (Equip 3)**: Choose 3 wires in your stand. Announce a value.  
  - Success if at least one matches.  
  - Teammate cuts one matching wire (secretly).  
  - If no match, teammate places Info token on one of the three.  
- **Super Detector (Equip 5)**: Same as Triple, but for 2 wires.  
- **General Radar (Equip 8)**: Ask a teammate “Do you have a [value]?”  
  - They answer yes/no.  
  - **Red/Yellow wires have no numerical value** → cannot answer “yes” for a red 7.5 when asked about “7”.  
- **Stabilizer (Equip 9)**: Pretend to cut a wire (e.g., when no valid cut is possible).  
  - Prevents detonator advancement when skipping turn.  
  - If you “cut” a red wire, do **not** place an Info token.  
- **X or Y Ray (Equip 10)**: Announce **two values**.  
  - Success if one of your wires matches either value.  
  - That wire is cut and revealed, and you also reveal **another wire** of the same value (if any).  
- **Walkie-Talkies (Equip 2)**: Swap any uncut wire with a teammate.  
  - Info tokens move with the wire.  
  - No communication allowed during swap.  
  - In Mission 24: Info token is **discarded** if wire is swapped.  
- **Grapple (Equip 11-11)**: If you control two stands, choose which stand to place a received wire on.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Wire Values  
- **Blue wires**: Have values 1–12. Used for matching.  
- **Red/Yellow wires**: Have **no numerical value** during play.  
  - Only their color matters.  
  - Cannot be targeted by number-based equipment (e.g., Double Detector).  
  - **Yellow wires** can be cut via:  
    - Dual Cut: Say “This is yellow” while pointing to a teammate’s wire and having a yellow wire in hand.  
    - Solo Cut: If you have all remaining yellow wires.  
  - **Red wires** can **never** be cut. Only revealed when all your wires are red.  

#### Validation Tokens  
- When **all four** blue wires of a value are cut, place a Validation token on that number on the board.  
- Serves as a memory aid.  

#### Communication Rules  
- **Forbidden**:  
  - Talking about wires in your hand.  
  - Hinting at values.  
  - Recalling past turns or guesses.  
- **Allowed**:  
  - Discussing tactics.  
  - Reminding others to use equipment.  
  - Recalling mission-specific rules.  

#### Player Elimination  
- When a player has **no wires left**, they are out.  
- Skip their turn. Game continues with remaining players.  

#### Info Tokens  
- Used to reveal wire values after failed cuts.  
- If a needed Info token is unavailable:  
  - Retrieve one whose wire is already cut.  
  - Otherwise, **say the value aloud and point clearly** — others must remember.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Win Condition  
- **All players have empty tile stands** → mission successful.  

#### Loss Conditions  
- A **red wire is cut** → bomb explodes.  
- **Detonator dial reaches the skull** → bomb explodes.  

#### After Game End  
- **Loss**: Change Captain, replay the same mission.  
- **Win**: Unlock next mission tier (e.g., complete Mission 8 → open Surprise Box with Missions 9–19).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

| Question | Answer |
|--------|--------|
| Can I make a Solo Cut with wires from both my stands? | Yes, as long as it's the last 2 or 4 of that value in play. |
| Can I Solo Cut 3 wires? | No. Must wait until a pair is reduced to 2 (after a teammate cuts one). |
| Can I use Double Detector on two non-adjacent wires? | Yes. They must be on the same stand, but not necessarily adjacent. |
| Can I use equipment on another player’s turn? | Yes, unless specified otherwise. |
| What if I name a value I don’t have? | It’s allowed but costly: detonator advances one notch. |
| What if I point to a red wire with Double Detector? | Bomb explodes only if both are red. If one is red, teammate places Info token on the non-red one. |
| Can I use X or Y Ray with Double Detector? | Yes. Announce two values and point to two wires. |
| What if a player has only uncuttable wires (e.g., C only, B not cut)? | Bomb explodes (Mission 9). |
| Can the same player go twice in a row? | Only in 2-player games or if they are the only one with wires (Mission 10). |
| Can I cut a red wire with equipment? | No. Red wires have no value and cannot be targeted (Mission 13). |
| What if the Restraint card pile is empty? | Continue without restraint (Mission 32). |
| What if a player has no Number cards? | Next player to the right plays one (Mission 29). |
| Can I skip my turn? | Only if allowed by mission rules (e.g., Mission 44, 49, 54). Usually costs detonator advancement. |
| Can I use Stabilizer to skip turn without penalty? | Yes (Mission 44). |
| What if I get a Number card for a wire I don’t have? | Ignore it (Mission 39). |
| What if the special wire is red? | Bomb explodes (Mission 41). |
| What if I have two stands and use Grapple? | Choose which stand to place the wire on (Equip 11-11). |
