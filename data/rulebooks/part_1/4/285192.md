## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In a world on the brink of apocalypse, omens signal the coming of the Angel of Death. Famine, pestilence, and war ravage the land. Yet, hope remains in the form of chosen individuals—players—who each carry a personal Destiny shaped by divine will. Each player assumes the role of a hero whose fate is intertwined with Heaven’s design. The objective is to fulfill one of two possible Destiny paths by exploring the world, interacting with NPCs, overcoming challenges, and making pivotal choices. The first player to complete their Destiny wins.

2. Components  
- 67 Map Tiles (one side explored, one unexplored)  
- Player Boards (1 per player)  
- Main Dice (2 white dice per player)

- 3D Points of Interest Minis  
- App (required for gameplay, narrative, and scenario control)

3. Setup  
- Choose a scenario in the app and read the introduction aloud.  
- The Nature of the Beast is standalone; the other four form a campaign best played in order.  
- Each player selects a character (random if undecided).  
- Each player receives:  
  - 1 Player Board  
  - 2 Main Dice and 3 Effort Dice  
  - 1 Coin  
  - Character’s Destiny Card and Miniature  
- Place 2 Main Dice and 1 Coin in the supply area of the player board.  
- Place 3 Effort Dice off the board (exhausted).  
- Place skill tokens on skill tracks as directed by the app.  
- Privately read and place the Destiny Card face-down on the board (illustration visible).  
- Set up the map:  
  - Place starting explored tile.  
  - Add Points of Interest tokens and 3D minis as per app.  
  - Place all character miniatures on the starting tile.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order, passing the app device. Each turn has three phases:  

1. Start of Turn  
- Refresh 1 exhausted Effort Die by returning it to your supply.  
- This is when most game events trigger (via app).  

2. Movement  
- Move up to 2 tiles orthogonally (no diagonals).  
- You may stay on your current tile.  
- If moving to an unexplored tile:  
  - Stop movement immediately.  
  - Explore the tile via the app: flip to explored side, place POIs, add adjacent unexplored tiles.  
- After moving to an explored tile, you may visit 1 Point of Interest (POI) on that tile.  

3. Visiting a Point of Interest  
Click the POI in the app and read the description aloud. You may choose any available options in any order (each only once per visit):  
- Interactions: Automatic actions with unknown consequences.  
- Tests: Skill-based challenges (Intelligence, Dexterity, Power).  
- Scanning Items: Use or discuss items with NPCs.  
- Scanning Destiny: Share your Destiny path with an NPC for hints (scan specific path’s QR code).  
- Scan or Test: Choose to use a correct item (automatic success/fail) or take a test (chance of success).  
- Trading: Buy/sell items at trade stacks (if available).  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Tests**  
  - Required: Roll 2 Main Dice.  
  - Optional: Roll 0–3 Effort Dice (each used die is exhausted).  
  - Total all dice values.  
  - For each skill marker on the relevant track at a number ≤ roll total, gain 1 success.  
  - Each star (★) on an Effort Die = 1 automatic success.  
  - Enter total successes into app (max 6 needed).  
  - Skill Types:  
    - Intelligence: Reasoning, social, focus.  
    - Dexterity: Stealth, perception, agility.  
    - Power: Strength, endurance, combat.  

- **Experience**  
  - Earned via interactions.  
  - Spend during your turn (not during a test).  
  - 1 XP = move skill markers 2 spaces left total (e.g., 1 marker 2 left, or 2 markers 1 left).  
  - No two markers may occupy the same space.  

- **Skill Gain/Loss**  
  - App may instruct skill gain (move markers left) or loss (move right).  
  - Player chooses how to distribute movement across markers on the track.  
  - Permanent; can be offset later with XP.  

- **Items**  
  - Inventory limit: 5 cards.  
  - Excess items: Abandon or use Discard ability.  
  - Abandoned items: Place near map with Trade Stack Tokens (one on item, one on tile).  
    - Any player visiting a POI on that tile may pick it up as a free action.  
  - Abilities:  
    - Always: Active while in inventory.  
    - Discard: Use ability, then return card to box.  
  - Use abilities freely during your turn unless specified.  

- **Trading**  
  - First-time trade: Create trade stack with app-specified items + matching Trade Stack Tokens.  
  - One token stays at POI, one on the item stack.  
  - Prices = printed coin value (buy/sell).  
  - Any number of items can be traded per turn.  
  - Trade stack persists; items sold by one player can be bought by others.  
  - Coins can also be used to bribe, repay, or throw (return to supply).  

- **Scanning**  
  - Item Scan: Represents using or discussing an item. Consequences vary.  
  - Destiny Scan: Share your Destiny path with NPC for hints (scan specific path’s QR).  
    - NPC responses are indirect to avoid revealing secrets.  

- **Events**  
  - Triggered at start of turn or via app.  
  - May alter POIs: move, remove, or change state.  
  - May involve NPC movement or world changes.  

- **Virtue**  
  - Hidden fourth skill tracked by app.  
  - Based on moral choices.  
  - Affects NPC interactions and states.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is no traditional scoring.  
- Victory condition: Fulfill your personal Destiny.  
- Each Destiny has two paths; players may switch between them freely.  
- When Destiny criteria are met, a Finale interaction (🜂) appears at a specific POI.  
- Clicking 🜂 starts the Finale: a multi-turn climactic sequence of events.  
- Once a player starts their Finale, they no longer take normal turns.  
- Finale duration depends on prior choices and preparation.  
- The first player to complete their Finale and fulfill their Destiny wins.  
- No player can be blocked from their Finale.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Inventory Overflow**: Must resolve immediately. Abandon or discard.  
- **Ambiguous Actions**: Resolve in the player’s favor.  
- **Item Use in Scan or Test**: Only one method (item or test) allowed per turn.  
- **Team Mode (Bound by Fate)**:  
  - 2 vs 2 mode. Teams sit alternately.  
  - Teammates can discuss openly.  
  - Can exchange items/coins if on same tile at turn start.  
  - Can summon teammate (within 2 tiles) during POI visit.  
  - Summoned teammate acts with summoner: shared actions, combined test successes, shared effects (except items: one gets item, other gets XP).  
  - Finale: Both must be present; they act together, and the non-triggering teammate skips future turns.  
- **Solo Mode**:  
  - Explorer Mode: No time pressure, story-focused.  
  - Challenger Mode: Time pressure, possible failure, replayable.  
- **Replayability**: Scenarios may be replayed only if all players have played them before.  
- **Submaps & Travel**: Use Travel POIs to switch maps. Destinations unlock over time. Hidden items may enable travel.  
- **Dungeons & Mazes**:  
  - Dungeons: Choose paths at intersections; remember routes.  
  - Mazes: Larger, with dead ends; solve via clues or luck.  
- **Destiny Hints**: Gain hints via murals, libraries, or NPC conversations (Destiny scans).
