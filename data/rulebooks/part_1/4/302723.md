### 3. Setup
**General Setup**:
1. Each player selects a player sheet, treasure chest card, and infamy marker.
2. Place pirate standees near each player.
3. Each player receives a 12-sided die matching their pirate.
4. Open the location book to the starting page.
5. Initialize global tracks:
   - Set hull, crew, supplies, and discontent to starting values (as defined by scenario).
   - Set threat track to 0.
6. The Quartermaster starts the app and selects the scenario.

**Infamy Placement by Player Count**:
- **Solo (1 player)**: Place infamy marker on the middle space of the infamy track.
- **2 Players**: Randomly determine order; place one marker on the 4th and the other on the 5th space of the infamy track.
- **3+ Players**: Not detailed in source; standard placement likely starts at bottom.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of three phases:

#### Planning Phase
1. Open the location book to the current page.
2. Check for a Warning (!) symbol; read associated hint.
3. Quartermaster starts the 40-second round timer in the app.
4. Players choose actions in order from **highest to lowest infamy**.
5. Action types:
   - **Green (Unlimited)**: Any number of players may choose.
   - **Blue (Limited)**: Only one player may choose.
   - **Red (Required)**: Must be selected by exactly one player before planning ends.
   - **Gray (Locked)**: Cannot be chosen (due to game effects).
6. If time runs out, **+1 to discontent**. Remaining players may still choose actions.

#### Action Phase
1. Resolve actions in numerical order (1, 2, 3...).
2. Within each action number, resolve from **highest to lowest infamy**.
3. When resolving:
   - Perform any skill check if required.
   - Gain skills, resources, or effects as indicated.
   - You may discard treasure cards to gain their listed effects.
   - Remove pirate standee after resolution.
4. **Ties** in timing or order are broken by infamy (higher goes first).

#### End of Round Phase
1. Read the "Round End" entry in the location book.
2. Enter the three-digit code from the book into the app.
3. Advance the story as directed.
4. If staying on the same page, **do not remove** placed tokens.
5. Prepare for next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Skill Checks
To resolve a skill check:
1. Roll your 12-sided die.
2. Add +1 for each checked box in the relevant skill on your player sheet.
3. Add bonuses from treasure or story cards.
4. Consult the location book for the result corresponding to your total.

**Special Conditions**:
- **Misfortune Token (banana)**: Roll 2 dice, take the lower result, then discard the token.
- **Re-Roll Token (arrow)**: Discard to re-roll a single die. Can be used even with a misfortune token (but must still take the lower die if applicable).

#### Gaining Skills and Constellation Progress
- Skills are gained via **white or black icons** on action spaces.
- When gaining a skill, mark it on your player sheet.
- If you **mark the final box in a skill row that ends with a star**, you may fill in a circle in your constellation.
- **Constellation rules**:
  - Start from the star-marked circle.
  - Filled circles must be connected.
  - If a filled circle has an (!), take a **constellation event token**.
- The number of (!) tokens determines your ending quality.

#### Treasure Cards
- Maximum of **4 treasure cards per player**.
- If a 5th is gained, discard any 1 treasure card and gain **+1 supplies**.
- Some treasures have effects when discarded; these **do not trigger** when discarding to stay under the limit or when burying treasure.
- "After you gain..." effects only trigger if the player keeps the card.
- Story cards are **not** treasure cards; no limit applies.

#### Ship Movement & Scouting
- Movement and scouting are directed by the book or app.
- **Moving into empty space**: Draw a tile first.
- If the ship lands on an **(!) tile**, stop immediately.
- The ship **cannot enter rocky waters tiles**.
- **Scouting**: Draw X navigation tiles face down, place them adjacent to the ship or previously placed tiles, then flip all.

#### Infamy Mechanics
- When gaining or losing infamy, move your marker along the track.
- **Solo Mode Exception**: If gaining infamy would move past the highest space, move to the lowest space and **fill in 1 star** on your constellation.
- **2-Player Mode Exception**: If moving would land on or pass the other player’s marker, **jump over** it. If landing on the lowest space, go to the next-lowest.
- When you **would fill in a star for any reason** (e.g., burying treasure, skill star), instead **gain +3 infamy**.

#### Supplies and Resources
- Supplies are used to gain skills in solo and 2-player modes.
- In **solo and 2-player modes**, gaining a skill requires spending **1 supply**. If unable or unwilling, you do not gain the skill.

#### Special Rules by Player Count

**Solo Mode (1 Player)**:
- Use **Hungry Pirates rule card**; do **not** use Masked Pirate.
- Use **4 pirate standees** of your choice.
- During planning, place all 4 standees; resolve 4 actions per round.
- When “all players” must perform a check, perform it **4 times**.
- “Number of players” is considered **4** for such checks.
- For all other effects (gain treasure, reroll, etc.), you are **1 player**.
- When you **would steal a treasure [O]**, you may instead **gain a treasure normally**, but **discontent → +1**.
- When gaining a skill, **spend 1 supply** or forgo the skill.
- “Other players” includes you.

**2-Player Mode**:
- Do **not** use Hungry Pirates or Masked Pirate rules.
- Each player uses **3 pirate standees** (total 6).
- Use dice matching standee colors to track ownership.
- Planning order: **higher infamy player places all 3 standees first**, then lower.
- Each resolves 3 actions.
- When “all players” perform a check, each performs it **3 times**.
- “Number of players” is considered **6** for such checks.
- For other effects, each is **1 player**.
- Gaining a skill costs **1 supply**.
- Infamy movement: if passing the other player’s marker, **jump over**.
- Gaining infamy past the top: move to lowest space, **fill in 1 star**.
- Filling a star for any reason: instead **gain +3 infamy**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End Conditions**:
- Scenario completes (goal reached).
- Any loss condition met (Mutiny, Drowning, Threat).

**Victory**:
- All players who complete **at least 4 constellation events** win.
- A player with **5 constellation events** achieves a **superior victory**.

**Ending Determination**:
1. Starting with highest infamy, proceed clockwise.
2. Each player checks how many (!) tokens they collected.
3. Consult the **Endings chart** on their player sheet to read their ending.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Q**: What if a game requirement is impossible (e.g., gain 5 treasures)?
  - **A**: Achieve the closest possible (e.g., gain 4 treasures).
- **Q**: Do I roll 2 dice for a skill check if I have a misfortune token?
  - **A**: Yes; take the lower result, then discard the token.
- **Q**: Can I use a re-roll token after rolling with a misfortune token?
  - **A**: Yes; re-roll one die, but must still take the lower if misfortune applies.
- **Q**: What happens when burying treasure?
  - **A**: Normally triggers “fill in a star” — but per variant rules, **gain +3 infamy** instead.
- **Q**: Can two players occupy the same infamy space?
  - **A**: No; in 2-player mode, markers **jump over** each other to avoid overlap.
- **Q**: Do story cards count toward treasure limit?
  - **A**: No; story cards are unlimited.
