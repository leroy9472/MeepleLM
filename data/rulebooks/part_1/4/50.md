# Lost Cities — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are explorers embarking on five possible expeditions (e.g., Himalayas, Desert, Rainforest, Volcano, Undersea). The goal is to maximize discovery points over three rounds by strategically forming expedition routes. Each expedition's score is calculated based on card values, risk (via wager cards), and length bonuses. The player with the highest total score after three rounds wins.

---

### 2. Components  
- 60 cards total:  
  - 45 numbered expedition cards: values 2–10 in five colors (9 per color)  
  - 15 wager (investment) cards: 3 per color  
- 1 game board with:  
  - Five labeled spaces for discard piles (one per color)  
  - Player areas on each side for building expeditions  
- Optional: score sheet and pen for tracking multi-round totals  

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board between two players.  
2. Shuffle all 60 cards.  
3. Deal 8 cards face down to each player.  
4. Form a face-down draw pile with the remaining 44 cards beside the board.  
5. Decide number of rounds (standard: 3). Prepare score tracking.  
6. Oldest player takes the first turn (unless a prior round was played; then highest scorer starts).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players alternate turns. On each turn:  
1. **Play a Card** – Choose one of the following:  
   - **Option A: Start or Extend an Expedition**  
     - Place a card face-up in one of your colored columns.  
     - To start: place any card (wager or number) in an empty column.  
     - To extend: new card must have a **higher number** than the last card in that column.  
     - Cards are overlapped so all values remain visible.  
     - Wager cards can **only** be played before any numbered card in a column.  
     - Multiple wager cards may be played consecutively at the start.  
   - **Option B: Discard a Card**  
     - Place a card face-up on the corresponding color’s discard pile on the board.  
     - Discard piles cover previous cards; only top card is visible.  
2. **Draw a Card** – After playing, draw one card from:  
   - The top of the draw pile, **or**  
   - The top of any discard pile (including opponent’s discards)  
   - **Exception**: You **cannot** draw the same card you just discarded on the same turn.  

> Note: Near end of game, players may fan the draw pile to count remaining cards and estimate turns left.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Ascending Order Rule**: Each expedition column must consist of cards in strictly increasing numerical order. Gaps are allowed (e.g., 2 → 5).  
- **Wager Cards**:  
  - Act as multipliers. Each wager card increases multiplier by 1 (base = 1).  
  - Max 3 per expedition (multiplier up to ×4).  
  - Can **only** be played before the first numbered card.  
- **Discard Strategy**: Discards are public; opponents may pick them up. Use to deny access or bluff.  
- **Hand Management**: Always maintain 8 cards until draw pile is exhausted.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Condition**: Game ends **immediately** when a player draws the **last card** from the draw pile.  
- **Scoring per Expedition (for each color):**  
  1. **Sum** the values of all numbered cards in the column.  
  2. **Subtract 20** (base cost of expedition).  
  3. **Multiply** result by:  
     - (Number of wager cards in column + 1)  
     - If no wager cards → ×1  
     - If 1 wager → ×2; 2 wagers → ×3; 3 wagers → ×4  
  4. **Add 20-point bonus** if the column has **8 or more total cards** (including wagers).  
- **Empty Expeditions**: No cards = 0 points (no -20 penalty).  
- **Negative Scores**: Possible if (sum - 20) is negative.  
- **Total Score**: Sum of all five expedition scores.  
- **Next Round**: Reshuffle all cards, deal 8 each, winner of previous round starts.  
- **Final Winner**: After **three rounds**, highest cumulative score wins.

#### Scoring Example:  
| Color | Cards | Sum | −20 | Wagers | Multiplier | +20 Bonus? | Score |  
|-------|-------|-----|-----|--------|------------|------------|-------|  
| Red   | [W, W, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10] | 35 | 15 | 2 | ×3 | No (7 cards) | 45 |  
| Green | [W, 2, 4] | 6 | −14 | 1 | ×2 | No | −28 |  
| Blue  | [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] | 52 | 32 | 0 | ×1 | Yes (8 cards) | 52 |  
| Yellow | – | 0 | – | – | – | – | 0 |  
| White | [W,W,W,2] | 2 | −18 | 3 | ×4 | No | −72 |  
| **Total** | | | | | | | **−3** |

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a number equal to the last one?**  
  No. All cards must be **strictly increasing**.  
- **Can I add a wager card after playing a number?**  
  No. Wager cards are only allowed **before** the first number card.  
- **Can I discard and then draw that same discard later?**  
  Only **on a future turn**. You **cannot draw a card you discarded this turn**.  
- **Do wager cards count toward the 8-card bonus?**  
  Yes. All cards in the column (wagers and numbers) count toward total card count.  
- **Can I have more than one expedition of the same color?**  
  No. Only one column per color per player.  
- **What if I can’t or don’t want to play a card?**  
  You **must** still play one card per turn — either play it in an expedition (if legal) or discard it.
