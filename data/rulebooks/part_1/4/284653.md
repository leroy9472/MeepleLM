5. Core Mechanics
- Recruiter Movement (STEP):
  - Move to orthogonally adjacent location (diagonal allowed only to/from Temples).
  - Cannot revisit locations (only one number per location).
  - Cannot move through Mayhem (except via MIND SLIP).
  - May move into Agent-occupied locations.
- MIND SLIP:
  - Discard MIND SLIP token to use special ability from Recruiter card:
    - Karl Box: Move 2 spaces orthogonally in straight line; may pass through visited locations and Mayhem.
    - Pipe Girl: Move 2 spaces diagonally in straight line; may pass through visited locations and Mayhem.
  - Write next number on new location; skip intermediate spaces.
  - Place discarded MIND SLIP token beside Time Track.
  - 2nd MIND SLIP token on board may be retrieved by visiting its location (no announcement required); can be used later.
- Immortals:
  - Move 1 Immortal per Recruiter turn (before or after action).
  - May move orthogonally or diagonally to adjacent location.
  - Cannot occupy same location as another Immortal.
  - Cannot move through Mayhem.
  - Block ASK, REVEAL, and CAPTURE actions in their location.
  - Immortal Recruiting: When 2 Immortals occupy different locations with the same Feature shown on IMMORTAL RECRUITING cards, immediately place 1 Recruit token and discard that Feature card.
  - Extra Immortal Move: Place a STEP token on a visited location (no token/mental note) to move a second Immortal this turn.
- Agent Movement:
  - Move up to 2 spaces (orthogonal only, unless Temple involved).
  - May change direction.
  - May move through or into Immortal-occupied locations.
  - Cannot move through Mayhem.
  - Action ends movement.
- Agent Actions:
  - ASK: Choose a Feature in current location (if no Immortal present and Feature’s location not occupied by Immortal). Recruiter must place STEP token on one visited location with that Feature (if possible).
  - REVEAL: Discard STEP token on current location to learn when Recruiter visited; place Confirmed Mental Note with time.
  - SHAKEDOWN: When in same location as Immortal. Guess a Feature; if correct, Recruiter reveals and discards that Feature card. Then, push Immortal 1 space orthogonally.
  - CAPTURE: Attempt to capture Recruiter. If Recruiter is present, Rogue Agents win.
- Mental Notes:
  - Unconfirmed (white): Used for speculation; can be placed, moved, or removed freely.
  - Confirmed (green): Placed by Recruiter after REVEAL; cannot be changed.
- Temples:
  - Allow diagonal movement to and from.
  - Recruiter and Agents may move diagonally when entering or leaving.
- Contacting Recruits:
  - Recruiter contacts 1 Recruit per circled Feature visited.
  - Total revealed only when Time Token hits Alert icon (odd-numbered red space).
  - Immortals contact Recruits via IMMORTAL RECRUITING cards (immediate reveal).
- Advance Time Token:
  - After Recruiter’s turn, advance Time Token.
  - On Alert space: Reveal total Recruits contacted this round.
  - Recruiter wins immediately upon revealing 9th (Training) or 12th (Full Game) Recruit.

6. Scoring & End Game
- Recruiter wins if:
  - Reveals 9th (Training) or 12th (Full Game) Recruit
  - Time Token reaches 14:00 (Training) or 16:00 (Full Game)
- Rogue Agents win if:
  - Successfully CAPTURE the Recruiter
  - Recruiter cannot make a legal move (boxed in)

7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- If Recruiter cannot move legally, Rogue Agents win immediately.
- Recruiter may not use MIND SLIP partially—must use full movement.
- Recruiter must reveal exactly one location when ASKed, if possible.
- If no valid location to place STEP token during ASK, Recruiter says so—this provides intel.
- Immortals cannot recruit using Recruiter’s hidden Feature cards.
- After SHAKEDOWN reveals a Feature card, Recruiter crosses out unvisited matching Features on Secret Map.
- Recruiter may win via Immortal recruitment if 12th Recruit is contacted.
- Unconfirmed Mental Notes can track suspected paths or missed CAPTUREs.
- If Recruiter makes a mistake, they must correct it immediately or place Confirmed Notes equal to turns since error.
