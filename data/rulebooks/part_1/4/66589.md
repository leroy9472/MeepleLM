## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the 15th century, Portuguese explorers under Prince Henry the Navigator embarked on voyages to chart the African coast and establish trade routes to India and China. Players represent wealthy Portuguese trade dynasties competing to explore unknown seas, establish colonies, build economic infrastructure, and earn the most victory points (VPs) by the end of the game.

**Objective:** Be the player with the most victory points after the game ends, scored through workers, ships, money, explorations, buildings, colonies, and privilege multipliers.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn follows this sequence:

1. **Optional Navegador Action (if card is held):**  
   - Perform a Sailing action before regular turn  
   - After use, pass card to the right  
   - If not used before player’s marker reaches the orange ship on the rondel (tracking receipt), pass it unused

2. **Rondel Movement:**  
   - Move game stone 1–3 spaces clockwise for free  
   - For each space beyond 3, pay 1 ship (return from board to supply)  
   - Must move; cannot stay in same space twice in a row

3. **Perform Action:**  
   Execute the action on the landed space. Actions can be skipped even if landed on.

4. **Phase Triggers:**  
   - **Phase II:** Triggered when any ship crosses into *Cabo da Boa Esperança* (first red border)  
   - **Phase III:** Triggered when any ship crosses into *Malaca* (second red border)  
   - New phase begins on the **next player turn**  
   - When a phase changes:  
     - Ships can sail up to 2 (Phase II) or 3 (Phase III) borders  
     - Extra workers/ships cost 200 (II) or 300 (III) Cruzados  
     - Replenish Privileges in Gallery to number per player count and phase (see board chart)

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions (Rondel Spaces):  

**Workers**  
- Buy 1 worker per church for 50 Cruzados each  
- Each additional worker beyond church count costs:  
  - Phase I: 100  
  - Phase II: 200  
  - Phase III: 300  
- Max 9 workers in Lisboa  
- With 9 workers: May “recruit” virtual workers (pay 50 each via churches), then sell to bank for 100 each (net +50 each)

**Ships**  
- Buy 1 ship per shipyard for 50 Cruzados each  
- Each additional ship beyond shipyard count costs:  
  - Phase I: 100  
  - Phase II: 200  
  - Phase III: 300  
- All new ships start in Portugal  
- Max 7 ships on board  
- With 7 ships: May “build” virtual ships (pay 50 each via shipyards), then sell to bank for 100 each (net +50 each)

**Sailing**  
- Ships may sail:  
  - Phase I: 1 border  
  - Phase II: 2 borders  
  - Phase III: 3 borders  
- May move in any direction, including back to Portugal  
- Multiple ships may coexist in a region  

**Sail to Unexplored Region (with explorer disk):**  
- Requires at least 2 ships to enter  
- 1 ship is lost (returned to supply)  
- **Dangerous Seas (Nagasaki, Macau with 2–3 players):** Requires 3 ships, loses 2  
- After entry:  
  - Take explorer disk (place on player mat)  
  - Reveal all colony tokens in region (leave face-up)  
  - Receive cash bonus = cost of cheapest revealed colony  
  - Leave at least 1 ship in the region  
- Only 1 new region may be explored per turn (but Navegador + Sailing allows 2)

**Colony**  
- Claim 1 or more colony tokens  
- Requirements per colony:  
  - 1 ship in the region  
  - 2 workers in Lisboa  
- Pay printed cost (sugar: 40–120; gold: 50–150; spice: 60–180)  
- Colonies of same type are identical; always take cheapest available  
- Ships and workers are **not spent** but can only be used once per turn

**Buildings**  
- Build factories, shipyards, or churches  
- Pay printed cost  
- Worker requirements (not spent, but must be available):  
  - Factory: 3 workers  
  - Shipyard: 4 workers  
  - Church: 5 workers  
- Total workers must suffice for all buildings built this turn  
- Buildings placed on player mat

**Market**  
For each good type (sugar, gold, spice), choose **sell** or **process**, not both.  

**Sell (via colonies):**  
- 1 unit per colony of that type  
- Receive current market price per unit  
- After sale: move price marker down 1 space per unit sold (min row 6)  

**Process (via factories):**  
- 1 unit per factory of that type  
- Orange (wild) factory can process any type  
- Receive income from red column at current price level  
- After processing: move price marker up 1 space per unit processed (max row 1)  

- Adjust all prices at end of turn  

**Privilege**  
- Pay 1 worker (must have >2 workers in Lisboa)  
- Take 1 available privilege token from Gallery  
- Place on highest empty space in matching column on player mat  
- Receive immediate cash bonus = (covered value) × (number of achievements of that type)  
  - E.g., 2 churches × 40 = 80 Cruzados  
- Max 3 privilege tokens per type  
- King’s Privilege variant (optional):  
  - May take King’s Privilege instead (if ship at Goa)  
  - No worker cost  
  - Immediate cash bonus applies  
  - Can only do this once per game

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

**Game End Triggered When:**  
- Nagasaki is explored (last sea region)  
- **OR** the last building (factory, shipyard, church) is taken  

**Final Turns:**  
- After trigger, all players (including the one who triggered it) take **one final turn**  
- If Navegador was used to trigger end, player completes both Navegador and regular turn before final round

**Scoring:**  
1. Place King’s Privilege on any empty privilege space on mat (no cash bonus)  
   - Counts as 2 VP per shipyard/church, or 1 VP per colony/factory/explorer  
2. Score base VPs:  
   - 1 VP per worker in Lisboa  
   - 1 VP per ship on board  
   - 1 VP per full 200 Cruzados  
3. Score privilege columns:  
   - For each category (Colonies, Factories, Explorers, Shipyards, Churches):  
     - Sum all values in column (including base and privilege multipliers)  
     - Multiply by number of achievements in that category  
   - Example: 4 factories × (1 + 1 + 0) = 8 VP  
4. Total all VPs using scoring track  

**Tiebreaker:**  
- Player holding Navegador card wins  
- If no one holds it, next player in turn order who would receive it wins

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip an action?** Yes. Landing on a space does not require using it.  
- **Can I explore twice in one turn?** Only via Navegador + Sailing action.  
- **Can I sell and process different goods?** Yes, but not the same good.  
- **Can I use orange factory for any good?** Yes, once per turn, any good.  
- **Do I need colonies to use factories?** No. Factories take goods from market.  
- **When are phase changes effective?** On the **next turn**, not immediately.  
- **How are privileges replenished?** At start of new phase, refill Gallery to number per player count and phase chart.  
- **Can I pass Navegador without using it?** Yes, if you don’t use it before your marker reaches the orange ship.  
- **Can I take a privilege with only 2 workers?** No. Must have >2 workers (i.e., at least 3).  
- **What if Gallery is empty?** Cannot take a privilege. Wait or use King’s Privilege variant.  
- **Can I build multiple buildings?** Yes, if you have enough workers and money.  
- **Does starting factory count for scoring?** Yes. The orange factory counts as 1 factory.
