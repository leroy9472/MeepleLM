## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
**Objective**: Be the player with the most money when the race ends.  

Players simulate a horse race where they can buy horses, place bets, influence movement, and use special abilities to maximize earnings. The game ends when three horses cross the finish line. Final scores are calculated based on purse winnings, bet payouts, jockey sets, remaining money, and scoring-related horse abilities.

**For 2–8 Players**:  
1. Place Track Board in the center.  
2. Place all 8 Horse Tokens behind the Start/Finish line.  
3. Select one Horse Card for each horse number (1–8) to form the Market. Cards may be from the same set or mixed.

5. Give each player:  
   - 1 Player Sheet  
   - 1 Dry Erase Marker  
   - $12 (record in Money circle)  
6. Shuffle Starting Cards and deal one to each player. On their Player Sheet, the player must:  
   - Mark 4 X’s on the Concession Grid (C) as shown on the card  
   - Write 2 horse numbers in the Bet spaces (B) as shown  
7. Return all Starting Cards to the box.  
8. The player who most recently made a real-life bet becomes the first Active Player and receives both dice.

**Solo Mode Setup (vs. Roland Wright AI)**:

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this sequence:

#### 1. **Roll Dice**  
Active Player rolls both the Horse Die (⑆) and Movement Die (⑆).

#### 2. **Move Horse**  
Move the Horse Token matching the Horse Die number forward a number of spaces equal to the Movement Die result.  
- If the horse has already finished, it does not move.  
- Horses cannot cross the finish line via direct player action (only via dice or secondary movement).

#### 3. **Secondary Movement**  
Refer to the Horse Card matching the rolled Horse Die number.  
- Move each horse marked (×) on its Secondary Movement Bar forward 1 space.  
- If multiple horses move, resolve in numerical order (lowest to highest).  
- Pre-printed × marks on the card are treated the same as player-marked ones.

#### 4. **All Players Take One Action**  
Starting with the Active Player and proceeding clockwise, each player chooses **one** action.  
Actions are restricted to the rolled Horse Die number unless a Wild Number is used.

##### Available Actions:  
- **Concession**: Mark an X on a Concession Grid space matching the rolled number.  
- **Helmet**: Mark a Helmet space matching the rolled number.  
- **Jersey**: Mark a Jersey space matching the rolled number, **and** mark any horse on the rolled horse’s Secondary Movement Bar.  
- **Bet**: Bet $1–$3 on the rolled horse (subtract from money).  
- **Buy**: Buy the rolled horse from the Market (pay cost; place card in front of you).  

##### Wild Number Option:  
- At the start of your turn, you may mark an X on one of your Wild Number spaces.  
- This allows you to treat the rolled horse number as any number of your choice for that turn (does not activate horse abilities).  
- If you cannot use the rolled number and have no usable Wilds, you may instead erase one marked Wild (resetting it for future use).

After all players act, the Active Player passes the dice to the left to begin the next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Concession Grid & Bonuses  
- The Concession Grid is a 4×4 grid with numbers 1–8.  
- Mark X’s in spaces matching the rolled horse number when taking the Concession action.  
- Completing a **row or column** (diagonals don’t count) grants **one** Concession Bonus.  
- Completing both a row and column simultaneously grants **two** bonuses.  
- Bonuses are resolved immediately and only once per completion.

##### Concession Bonuses:  
- Gain $7  
- Move any two horses backward 2 spaces each  
- Move any one horse backward 3 spaces  
- Move any two horses forward 2 spaces each  
- Move any one horse forward 3 spaces  
- Place a free $3 Bet on any horse (*No-Bet Line rule still applies*)  
- Take the Helmet action for any horse  
- Take the Jersey action for any horse  
- Take any horse from the Market for free (do not pay cost)

#### Helmet  
- Marking a Helmet for a horse allows you to Bet on it even if it is past the No-Bet Line (but not if it has finished).  
- Required to place bets on horses past the No-Bet Line.

#### Jersey  
- Marking a Jersey for a horse allows you to influence its movement via Secondary Movement Bars.  
- When you mark a Jersey, you also immediately mark **any horse** on the rolled horse’s Secondary Movement Bar.  
- Having both Helmet and Jersey on the same horse forms a Jockey Set.

#### Bet  
- Bet $1–$3 on the rolled horse.  
- Must have sufficient money.  
- Bets are cumulative (add to existing bet if already present).  
- Cannot bet on:  
  - Horses past the No-Bet Line without its Helmet  
  - Horses that have finished  
- Free Bets (from abilities) follow same rules but cost no money.

#### Buy  
- Purchase the rolled horse from the Market by paying its cost.  
- Place the Horse Card in front of you to indicate ownership.  
- Cannot buy a horse that has finished.

#### Horse Abilities  
- Each Horse Card has a unique ability.  
- Abilities only activate if the horse is owned.  
- Abilities are optional and resolve at specified triggers (e.g., when taking an action, at scoring).  
- Examples of triggers:  
  - At the start of your turn, if the rolled horse matches the specified number  
  - When you take the Concession, Helmet, Jersey, or Bet action  
  - When bought (immediate effect)  
  - At scoring (added during final scoring)

#### Movement Rules  
- Horses move forward by default.  
- Some effects move horses backward (marked with −).  
- If moved backward past Start/Finish line, stop at the line; excess movement is lost.  
- Multiple horses can occupy the same space.  
- When multiple horses move simultaneously, resolve in numerical order (lowest to highest).

#### No-Bet Line  
- Horses past this line cannot be bet on unless the player has marked its Helmet.  
- Free Bets also subject to this rule.  
- Bets placed before crossing still count.

#### Crossing the Finish Line  
- Horses can **only** cross the finish line via:  
  - Dice roll movement  
  - Secondary movement  
- Cannot cross via Concession Bonus, Horse Ability, or direct player movement.  
- When a horse crosses:  
  - Move it to the Winner’s Circle in the next available position (1st → $35, 2nd → $25, 3rd → $15).  
  - Once 3 horses finish, no more may cross. Any movement that would cross the line stops just before.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I take an action if the horse is not available (e.g., sold out)?**  
  Yes, for actions that don’t require availability (e.g., Concession, Helmet, Jersey). You cannot Buy if the horse is already owned.

- **Can I bet on a horse using a Wild Number?**  
  Yes, if you use a Wild to change the number, you can Bet on the new number.

- **Do Free Bets count toward Jockey Sets or scoring?**  
  Yes, they are real bets and pay out normally.

- **Can a horse finish from a Concession Bonus?**  
  No. Concession Bonus movement stops short of the finish line if needed.

- **What happens if a horse is moved forward past the finish line via multiple effects?**  
  Only dice roll or secondary movement can cross the line. Other effects stop at the line.

- **Can I use a Wild Number to take a Concession Bonus?**  
  No. Wild Numbers only affect actions during the action phase.

- **Can I mark multiple X’s in one turn?**  
  Only via game effects (e.g., Concession Bonus). Normally, one mark per action.
