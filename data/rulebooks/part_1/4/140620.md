### 1. Lore & Objective
In 1803, the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory, prompting President Jefferson to send expeditions to explore the newly acquired West. In *Lewis & Clark: The Expedition*, each player leads an expedition to cross the North American continent and be the first to reach Fort Clatsop on the Pacific coast. The game is a race driven by strategic resource and hand management, where players use character cards, Native Americans (Indians), and village actions to advance their scout along the route.

**Objective**: Be the first player to set up camp at or beyond Fort Clatsop, with no more Time tokens than the number of spaces between your camp and Fort Clatsop.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn, you must perform **one mandatory action**, and you may optionally:
- Recruit a new character
- Set up camp

Optional actions can be taken **before or after** the mandatory action, in any order, but each only once per turn.

#### Mandatory Action (Choose One):
1. **Character Card Action**
2. **Village Action**

#### Character Card Action
To activate a card from your hand:
- Play it face-up in your playing area.
- Provide Strength (1–3) using:
  - Another card from your hand (played face-down beneath it; Strength = card’s Strength)
  - 1–3 Indians from your boats (each = 1 Strength)
  - Combination of both (max total Strength = 3)
- The card’s action is performed as many times as the Strength provided.
- Face-down cards are inactive until reclaimed at camp.
- Indians used remain yours.

*Note*: You may use less than the full Strength or take only part of the benefit.

#### Village Action
- **Empty Circle (1 spot)**: Place 1 Indian to activate the action once.
- **Semicircle (unlimited spots)**: Place 1–3 Indians to activate the action that many times.
- Indians used return to the Stock (no longer yours).
- Actions available to all players.

---

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Recruitment (Optional)
- Pay:
  - **Fur** = position on Journal (1–5)
  - **Equipment** = Strength of the character (1–3)
- Equipment cost may be reduced by discarding **one** card from your hand. Discount = Strength of discarded card.
- Add the recruited card to your hand.
- Slide remaining Journal cards down and draw a new card to the top (5 Fur spot). Do not re-sort by Strength.

#### Set Up Camp (Optional)
*Must* be done if you cannot perform any action at the start of your turn.

1. Return all Indians from character cards to your boats.
2. **Calculate Time spent in Camp**:
   - +1 per card still in hand
   - +1 if 2nd boat has any resources
   - +1 per resource in 3rd boat
   - +1 per Indian in 5th boat
   - Apply penalties from any purchased Boat tiles
3. Move your Scout backward by the number of Time tokens spent.
4. If Scout lands on another Scout, continue moving backward until unoccupied.
5. Move your Camp token to your Scout’s position.
6. Return all played cards to your hand.

*Note*: If Scout is behind Camp, Camp does not move.

#### Movement Rules
- **Route Types**:
  - River (blue): Move using Food, Canoe, or Horse
  - Mountain (grey): Move using Horse only
  - Mountain-River (both): Either movement type allowed
- **No two Scouts may occupy the same space** (except St. Louis).
- If movement ends on an occupied space, move forward (or backward during camp) to the next unoccupied space.
- Movement type must be consistent per activation (cannot mix river/mountain in one activation).
- **Scout cannot move if Time tokens are present** — discard one per visible movement space until all are gone.

#### Starting Characters
- **Resource Collectors** (Lumberjack, Hunter, Blacksmith, Fur Trader):  
  Collect up to A × B resources, where:  
  - A = Strength used to activate  
  - B = number of visible resource badges in your and neighbors’ playing areas (front and back of cards)
- **Interpreter**:  
  - Gather all Indians from the Village (including Newcomer) to the Powwow area.  
  - Take any number of them into your boats.  
  - Discard the bottom Journal card and draw a new one.  
  - Add 1 Indian from Stock to Newcomer (if available).  
  - Repeat if activated with Strength >1.
- **Commander**:  
  For each Strength, choose:
  - Pay 1 Food → move 2 River spaces
  - Pay 1 Canoe → move 4 River spaces
  - Pay 1 Horse → move 2 Mountain spaces  
  Movement stops if terrain changes to incompatible type.

#### Village Actions
- **Hunting**: Take 1 Food + 1 Fur
- **Craftsmanship**: Take 1 Equipment + 1 Wood
- **Gift**: Take 2 Fur **or** 2 Wood
- **Farewell**: Discard 0–3 cards from hand; discard all Journal cards and refill with 5 new ones
- **Horse Trade**: Pay 3 different resources → take 1 Horse
- **Canoe Manufacturing**: Pay 2 Wood → take 1 Canoe
- **Expedition Upgrade**: Pay 3 Wood → take 1 Boat tile:
  - **Front**: Carries 2 resources, no Time cost
  - **Back**: Carries 1 Indian, no Time cost  
  Also take: 2 primary resources (Front) or 1 Indian (Back, if available)
- **Shamanism**: Pay 1 Food → activate **once** any face-up character card (yours or opponent’s). Cannot copy cards with ∞ symbol.

#### Permanent Effect Cards (∞ symbol)
- Must be activated with Strength (1–3) like any card.
- Effect applies later (e.g., during movement, recruitment, or camp).
- Cannot be copied via Shamanism or The Partisan.
- Return to hand during camp.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End Game**: Immediately when a player sets up camp at or beyond Fort Clatsop.

**Victory Condition**:  
- Player wins **if** the number of Time tokens they have ≤ number of spaces from their Camp to Fort Clatsop.
  - Camp at Fort Clatsop → must have 0 Time tokens
  - Camp 1 space before → ≤1 Time token
  - Camp 2 spaces before → ≤2 Time tokens, etc.

*Note*: If condition not met, game continues.

**No scoring** — first to meet the condition wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Partial Actions**: You may use less than full Strength or take only part of a benefit.
- **Farewell**: Always discards all 5 Journal cards, regardless of how many you discard from hand.
- **Horse Trade**: Can use Horses or Canoes as payment (e.g., pay 1 Horse, 1 Food, 1 Canoe).
- **Scout Movement**: Cannot end on opponent’s space; continue to next unoccupied space.
- **Reorganizing Boats**: At any time, rearrange resources/Indians to minimize Time cost.
- **Discarding Resources**: Only allowed during collection if boats are full.
- **Permanent Cards**: Must be activated to gain effect; effect strength = activation Strength.
- **Solo Variant**: Use 6 Indians total. Place Alexander Mackenzie 0–7 spaces ahead. After each turn, move him 1 space. Win by reaching Fort Clatsop first.
