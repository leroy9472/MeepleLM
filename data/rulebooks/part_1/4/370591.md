## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Dorfromantik is a peaceful tile-laying game where players collaboratively build a harmonious countryside landscape. The objective is to score the highest number of victory points (VP) by completing terrain-based tasks and optimizing special features across the landscape. The game ends when no more landscape tiles can be drawn, and final scoring determines the winner.

### 2. Components  
- **Landscape Tiles**: Hexagonal tiles depicting combinations of Village, Forest, Grain, Track, Stream, and other features (e.g., Flags, Sheep, Grade Crossings).  
- **Special Tiles**: Include Photographer, Balloon Launch Site, Forest Cabin, Harvest Festival, Watchtower, Locomotive, Ship, Great Mill, Cloud Tile, Construction Site, Hill, Granary, Old Oak, School, Signalman, Shepherdess, Train Station, Harbour, Circus, Warehouse.  
- **Task Tiles**: Hexagonal tiles indicating a terrain type and number (e.g., “Forest – 6”).  
- **Task Markers**: Round tokens matching terrain types (Village, Forest, Grain, Track, Stream); placed on Task Tiles.  
- **Figures**: Balloon, Photographer, Great Mill.  
- **Markers**: Camera Markers, Gold and Red Hearts.  
- **Score Sheets**: For tracking points from tasks and special tiles.  
- **Warehouse Card**: Allows storing one landscape tile for later use.

### 3. Setup  
1. Separate all Special Tiles from the deck.  
2. Discard 3 random Landscape Tiles face-down into the box (not used in the game).  
3. Shuffle all remaining Landscape Tiles, Special Tiles, and Task Tiles together into a single face-down draw pile.  
4. Stack Task Markers by type (Village, Forest, Grain, Track, Stream) in separate face-up piles.  
5. Place the Warehouse card nearby if unlocked.  
6. Randomly choose a starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn proceeds as follows:

#### Turn Order:
1. **Check Task Count**:  
   - If there are fewer than 3 incomplete Task Tiles on the map, draw and place a **Task Tile**.  
     - Draw a random Task Marker matching the terrain type and place it face-up on the Task Tile.  
     - Some Special Task Tiles have unique Task Markers.  
   - Otherwise, draw and place a **Landscape Tile**.

2. **Place Tile**:  
   - The tile must be placed adjacent to at least one existing tile.  
   - **Tracks** and **Streams** must connect edge-to-edge with matching types.  
   - Forest, Grain, and Village edges do not need to match.

3. **Optional Actions After Placement**:  
   - Place a **Gold** or **Red Heart** on the newly placed Landscape Tile (not Special or Task Tiles).  
   - If placing the **Great Mill**, put the figure on that tile (remains for the game).  
   - If placing the **Balloon Launch Site**, place the Balloon figure on it.  
     - On future turns, when placing a tile adjacent to the Balloon, you may move the Balloon to the new tile.  
   - If placing the **Photographer**, place the Photographer figure on it.  
     - When placing an adjacent tile, you may move the Photographer to it and place 1 Camera Marker on the new tile.  
   - If placing a tile on the **Warehouse Card**, you may store it there instead of placing it on the map.  
     - Later, any player may play this stored tile instead of drawing a new one.

4. **Complete or Invalidate Tasks**:  
   - If a terrain area exactly matches a Task Marker’s number, collect the Task Marker for end-game scoring.  
   - If placement causes the area to exceed the required number or closes it off prematurely, remove the Task Marker (no points awarded).  
   - Multiple tasks may be completed in a single turn.

5. **Cloud Tile Rules**:  
   - The Cloud Tile can connect any terrain types across its edges.  
   - When placing a tile adjacent to the Cloud, decide immediately whether the edges are connected through the Cloud.  
   - This decision is permanent.  
   - Tracks/Streams may branch through the Cloud if 3+ edges are involved.  
   - Clouds do not provide Sheep or Grade Crossings.

6. **Double & Wraparound Tasks**:  
   - **Double Tasks**: Complete when either of the two territories reaches exactly 6 tiles.  
   - **Wraparound Tasks**: Require a specific number of tiles adjacent to the task tile (tile itself does not count).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Tile Placement Rules:
- Must place adjacent to at least one existing tile.  
- Tracks and Streams must match type on adjacent edges.  
- Forest, Grain, Village edges may mismatch.  
- May place a Task Tile adjacent to an area already under task.  
- **Cannot place a Task Tile** if it would:  
  - Immediately make the area larger than the Task Marker number.  
  - Close off the area so fewer tiles can be added than required.  
- If a tile connects more tiles than allowed by an existing Task Marker, remove the marker (no points).  

#### Special Tile Abilities:
- **Great Mill**: Place on Grain tile. If Grain area is closed and connected, score 2 VP per Grain Task and yellow Flag in that area.  
- **Balloon**: Move to adjacent tile when placing next to it. Score 2 VP per tile traveled (shortest path from Launch Site).  
- **Photographer**: Move when placing adjacent; place 1 Camera Marker. Score 1 VP per Camera Marker.  
- **Forest Cabin / Harvest Festival / Watchtower / Locomotive / Ship**: When completing a task, place the completed Task Marker **face-down** on one of these tiles. At end game, score those markers a **second time**.  
- **Construction Site**: Score 7 VP per terrain type (Grain, Forest, Village) if that territory has ≥7 tiles (max 21 VP).  
- **Hill**: Score 2 VP per Task Tile (complete or incomplete) within 2 tiles.  
- **Granary**: Score 1 VP per Grain tile within 2 tiles (empty spaces count).  
- **Old Oak**: Score 1 VP per Forest tile within 2 tiles.  
- **School**: Score 1 VP per Village tile within 2 tiles.  
- **Signalman**: Score 2 VP per Grade Crossing on the connected Track (Track need not be complete).  
- **Shepherdess**: Score 1 VP per Sheep in connected tiles with Sheep. Sheep on disconnected tiles do not count.  
- **Train Station**: If on a closed Track, score 1 VP per tile in that Track (including itself).  
- **Harbour**: If on a closed Stream, score 1 VP per tile in that Stream (including itself).  
- **Circus**: Score 10 VP if completely surrounded (all 6 edges).  
- **Flags**: In a closed territory, each Flag scores VP equal to the number of tiles in that territory. Multiple Flags score separately.  
- **Hearts**:  
  - Red Heart: 1 VP per matching edge.  
  - Gold Heart: 2 VP per matching edge.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Trigger:  
The game ends immediately when a player must draw a Landscape Tile but none remain.

#### Final Scoring:  
Score all of the following:

1. **Tasks**:  
   - Sum all completed Task Markers by terrain type (Village, Forest, Grain, Track, Stream).  
   - Include any Task Markers placed face-down on Forest Cabin, Harvest Festival, Watchtower, Locomotive, or Ship — these are scored **twice**.

2. **Flags**:  
   - For each Flag in a **closed** territory, score VP equal to the number of tiles in that territory.  
   - Multiple Flags in same territory score separately.

3. **Longest Track & Stream**:  
   - Score 1 VP per tile in the longest continuous Track.  
   - Score 1 VP per tile in the longest continuous Stream.

4. **Hearts**:  
   - Red Heart: 1 VP per matching edge.  
   - Gold Heart: 2 VP per matching edge.

5. **Special Tiles**:  
   - **Circus**: 10 VP if fully surrounded.  
   - **Signalman**: 2 VP per Grade Crossing on connected Track.  
   - **Shepherdess**: 1 VP per Sheep in connected Sheep tiles.  
   - **Train Station**: 1 VP per tile in closed Track it's on.  
   - **Harbour**: 1 VP per tile in closed Stream it's on.  
   - **Construction Site**: 7 VP per terrain type (Grain, Forest, Village) with ≥7 tiles.  
   - **Hill**: 2 VP per Task Tile within 2 tiles.  
   - **Granary**: 1 VP per Grain tile within 2 tiles.  
   - **Old Oak**: 1 VP per Forest tile within 2 tiles.  
   - **School**: 1 VP per Village tile within 2 tiles.  
   - **Balloon**: 2 VP per tile traveled from Launch Site (shortest path).  
   - **Photographer**: 1 VP per Camera Marker placed.  
   - **Great Mill**: 2 VP per Grain Task and yellow Flag in closed Grain area it's on.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a Task Tile that doesn’t match any current area?**  
  No. Task Tiles must be placed adjacent to a terrain area of the matching type.

- **Can I complete a task with the Cloud Tile?**  
  Yes, as long as the Cloud connects the required number of tiles via its edges.

- **What if I place a tile that completes multiple tasks?**  
  Yes, you may complete multiple tasks in one turn. Collect all valid Task Markers.

- **Can I move the Balloon or Photographer multiple times per turn?**  
  No. You may move it only once per tile placement — when placing a tile adjacent to its current location.

- **Do face-down Task Markers on special tiles count toward task totals?**  
  No. Only the physical count of tiles matters for task completion. Face-down markers are only for bonus scoring.

- **Can I store a Special Tile in the Warehouse?**  
  Yes, as long as it is a Landscape Tile (Special Tiles are Landscape Tiles unless specified otherwise).

- **Is the Warehouse mandatory?**  
  No. It is optional. You may choose to place the tile immediately instead.
