## 3. Setup

### General Setup (The Bank Job – 3 Floors)
1. Set aside 3 Safe and 3 Stairs tiles.
2. Shuffle the remaining 42 room tiles and divide into 3 decks of 14.
3. Add 1 Safe and 1 Stairs tile to each deck; shuffle and lay each into a 4x4 grid.
4. Place 8 walls on each floor as per scenario or randomizer.
5. Sort Patrol cards into 3 decks by floor; shuffle each.
6. Discard Patrol cards based on player count:
   - 3 players: discard 3 per deck
   - 2 players: discard 6 per deck
   - 1 player: discard 9 per deck
7. Place a Guard and red Guard die beside each deck:
   - Floor 1: die shows 2
   - Floor 2: die shows 3
   - Floor 3: die shows 4
8. Reveal top Patrol card; place Guard on indicated tile.
9. Choose entrance tile on first floor; reveal it and mark with a Downstairs token.
10. Reveal next Patrol card; place Guard die on destination tile.
11. Shuffle Tool, Loot, and Event decks; place them nearby.
12. Each player draws a Character card, takes matching piece and 3 Stealth tokens.

### Alternative Scenarios

- Split into 2 decks; add 1 Safe and 1 Stairs to each.
- Deal each into 5x5 grid with one empty space (same location on both floors).
- Place 12 walls per floor.
- Guard movement: Floor 1 = 3, Floor 2 = 4.
- Use Patrol cards with white circle (Floor 1) and black circle (Floor 2).
- Triangle symbol on Patrol cards indicates destination.

## 4. Gameplay Flow

Each turn proceeds in three phases:

1. **Take Actions (up to 4):**
   - Peek at adjacent tile
   - Move to adjacent tile
   - Hack (on Computer tile)
   - Add Die (on Safe tile, costs 2 actions)
   - Crack Safe (on Safe tile)
   - Other character or tool actions

2. **Check for Events:**
   - If 2 or fewer actions taken, draw and resolve an Event card.

3. **Move the Guard (on current floor):**
   - Guard moves number of spaces = Guard die + number of active Alarms.
   - Takes shortest path to destination (die location).
   - If multiple shortest paths, takes most clockwise route.
   - When Guard reaches destination:
     - If Alarm present, deactivate it.
     - If more Alarms, move to next closest.
     - Else, draw next Patrol card for new destination.
   - Guard continues moving if remaining movement.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Movement
- Players and Guards move orthogonally; no diagonal or wall traversal.
- Moving into a Guard’s tile costs 1 Stealth token.
- Unrevealed tiles are revealed upon movement.

### Peeking
- Reveal adjacent tile without entering.
- Must declare Peek or Move before revealing.

### Alarms
- Triggered by entering Alarm tiles (Laser, Fingerprint, Motion, Thermo, Scanner).
- Place Alarm token and Guard die on tile.
- Guard moves toward closest Alarm.
- Can cancel with Hack token (if matching type) or accept consequences.
- Only one Alarm token per tile.

### Hacking
- Spend 1 action on a Computer tile to add a Hack token.
- Max 6 tokens per Computer.
- Cancel matching Alarm (Fingerprint, Laser, Motion) by discarding token.

### Cracking Safes
1. Reveal all 6 tiles in same row/column as Safe.
2. Combination = numbers in bottom-right corners.
3. Add dice to Safe (2 actions per die).
4. Roll all dice; place Cracked tokens on revealed tiles matching any die.
5. When all 6 combination tiles have Cracked tokens, Safe is cracked:
   - Draw 1 Tool and 1 Loot.
   - Increase movement of current and lower-floor Guards by 1 (permanent).

### Special Tiles
- **Atrium:** Peek up/down.
- **Camera:** Guard on Camera sees all revealed Cameras; triggers remote Alarm.
- **Deadbolt:** 3 actions to enter if unoccupied.
- **Fingerprint:** Alarm unless Hack token used.
- **Foyer:** Lose Stealth if Guard is adjacent.
- **Keypad:** Guess code (roll 6); failed attempts require more dice next try.
- **Laboratory:** First player draws a Tool.
- **Lavatory:** Holds 3 shared Stealth tokens.
- **Motion:** Cannot enter and leave same turn.
- **Secret Door:** Enter through walls; one-way.
- **Service Duct:** Once both found, move between as adjacent.
- **Stairs:** Move up/down; mark upper tile with Downstairs token.
- **Thermo:** Alarm if turn ends here.
- **Walkway:** Entering reveals it; player falls to floor below (not “entering”).

### Tools
- Used as free action on player’s turn.
- Examples: Donuts (skip Guard move), EMP (cancel all Alarms), Thermal Bomb (create temporary stairs), Virus (place 3 Hack tokens).

### Loot
- Carried penalties; must all be escaped with.
- Examples: Chihuahua (bark Alarm on 6), Tiara (lose Stealth when adjacent to Guard), Persian Kitty (summons token on 1–2).

## 6. Scoring & End Game

**Winning:**  
Crack all safes, collect all loot, and have all players escape via top-floor stairs (1 action each).

**Losing:**  
Any player must lose a Stealth token but has none — they are caught and the team loses.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Starting tile:** No effects trigger on first action of first turn for each player.
- **Peeking vs Moving:** Must declare before revealing.
- **Multiple Alarms:** Guard prioritizes closest; players choose if tie.
- **Event Cards:** Must draw if ≤2 actions taken; cannot avoid by moving back and forth.
- **Guard Movement:** Continues even after passing player’s tile; only stops at destination or end of movement.
- **Lost Visual Cards:** Remove Guard and die; next turn, draw new location and destination (Guard does not move that turn).
- **Trading:** Tools and Loot can be freely traded on same tile as free action.
- **Dropping Items:** Not allowed unless card specifies.
- **Wall Placement:** Must not isolate any area; walls between tiles only.
