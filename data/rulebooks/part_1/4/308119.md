# Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Pax Renaissance is a strategy game set in the 15th–16th century where players act as bankers influencing political, religious, and economic developments across Europe and the Mediterranean. The goal is to achieve victory through one of several endgame conditions tied to historical themes: imperialism, trade globalization, religious dominance, or cultural enlightenment.

Victory is achieved by meeting the conditions of an active Victory Square. Players compete to control empires, manipulate religious and political systems, and strategically place tokens to gain economic and strategic advantages.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Token Placement & Movement
- **Pawns (Concessions)**:

  - If occupied, pay 1 Florin to repress the existing pawn.
  - Earn profits during trade fairs if on active trade route.

  - Placed in cities on map cards.
  - During agent placement, ignore city icons.
  - Repress existing token by paying 1 Florin.
- **Bishops**:
  - Placed on any tableau card or throne with matching location.
  - If another bishop is present, both are killed.
  - Silences all ops except Inquisitor.
- **Pirates**:
  - Placed on sea borders (any empire in card’s location).
  - Automatically kills any concession or pirate present.
  - Moved via Corsair op.

#### Actions
- **Purchase Market Card**:
  - Pay 1 Florin per card to its left (in same row).
  - If column empty, pay in other row.
  - Cannot buy a card you placed a Florin on this turn.
- **Play Card from Hand**:
  - Add to tableau (West cards left, East cards right).
  - Optionally trigger One-Shot (bomb icon).

  - **Cost 1 Florin**: Agent placement, Regime Change.
  - **Gain 1 Florin**: Repress op.
  - **Free**: Tax op, trade shift, battle overflow.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you campaign against your own empire?** No. Campaigns only target empires not in your tableau.
- **Can you vote for your own empire?** Yes. Can create a Republic via Strawman Regime Change.
- **Do repressed tokens fight in battles?** Only in conspiracies and peasant revolts (Rooks/Knights and Pawns respectively).
- **Can pirates coexist with concessions?** Only if protected by Ability (e.g., Arsenal); otherwise, pirate kills concession on placement.
- **Can bishops move between East and West tableau?** Only via adjacent cards or same-location cards; cannot cross Player Board unless adjacent.
- **What happens to vassals during regime change?** Vassals are returned to their thrones if suzerain changes regime.
- **Can you place agents on saturated cities?** No. Must repress existing token (pay 1 Florin) to place.
- **Do tokens move after battles?** No. Survivors are placed in conquered empire; original positions unchanged.
