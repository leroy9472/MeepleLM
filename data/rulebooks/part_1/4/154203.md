### 1. Lore & Objective
Settlers from four major world powers—Romans, Barbarians, Egyptians, and Japanese—discover new lands and compete to build the most powerful empire. The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VP) over five rounds by building locations, making deals, and hindering opponents. The player with the highest VP total at the end of the game wins.

### 2. Components
- 1 Scoreboard with Victory Point and Round tracks  
- 4 Faction Boards (Romans, Egyptians, Japanese, Barbarians), each with male/female sides (aesthetic only)  
- 4 Faction Markers  
- 1 Round Marker  
- 1 First Player Marker  
- 4 Faction Decks (30 cards each)  
- 84 Common Cards  
- 16 Attack Cards (used in solo mode)  
- 32 Food, 32 Wood, 32 Stone (Resources)  
- 24 Gold Tokens (joker resources)  
- 40 Workers  
- 18 Raze Tokens (military units)  
- 10 Defense Tokens (4 used in base game, 6 for expansions)  
- 6 Multiplier Tokens (for tracking large quantities)  
- 4 Egyptian Special Tokens (for Temple of Ra card)

### 3. Setup
1. Place the scoreboard in the center. Set the round marker to "1".
2. Shuffle the Common deck and place it within reach.
3. Each player:
   - Chooses a faction and takes the corresponding faction board, deck, and marker.
   - Places their faction marker on "0" of the VP track.
   - Draws 2 faction cards and 2 common cards as their starting hand.
4. Place all resources, workers, raze tokens, defense tokens, and gold in the general supply.
5. Randomly select the first player, who takes the first player marker.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the 5 rounds consists of 4 phases:

#### 1. Lookout Phase
- Each player draws 1 card from their faction deck.
- Reveal #P+1 common cards (where #P = number of players).
- Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player selects one card.
- Discard the remaining card.
- Repeat the process, but this time starting with the last player and proceeding counter-clockwise.
- Each player adds their 2 selected common cards and 1 faction card to their hand.

#### 2. Production Phase
Beginning with the first player and proceeding clockwise, players collect goods from:
- **Faction Board**: Base production (workers, resources, tokens).
- **Deals**: Each active deal provides its indicated good.
- **Production Locations**: Each produces its listed goods.
- Cards drawn during production may come from either the common or faction deck.
- VPs are immediately added to the player’s score.
- Defense tokens are gained and may be placed during the Action Phase.

#### 3. Action Phase
Players take turns in clockwise order, performing one action per turn until all pass. Available actions:
- **Build a Location**: Pay the building cost (resources and/or discard a built location/foundation). Place the card in the correct row (Production, Feature, Action) and side (Faction or Common). If it's a Production Location, gain its production immediately. Building bonuses are applied once upon construction.
- **Make a Deal**: Discard 1 food and place a faction card face-down under your faction board. Gain the deal’s good immediately and in every subsequent Production Phase.
- **Raze**:
  - *From hand*: Discard 1 raze token to raze a common card (or faction card if Japanese). Gain the raze reward.
  - *Opponent’s location*: Discard 2 raze tokens (plus 1 extra per defense token or samurai). Gain the raze reward. The opponent flips the card to its foundation side and gains 1 wood (unless it’s a Japanese faction card, which is discarded).
- **Activate an Action Location**: Pay the required cost (placed on the card). Use its ability. May be activated once per round unless stated otherwise. If allowed twice, may be used both times in one turn.
- **Spend 2 Workers**: Exchange 2 workers for 1 resource (any type) or 1 card (common or faction). May be done multiple times in one action.
- **Pass**: End your turn permanently. Once passed, you cannot be targeted by other players.

**Free Actions**:
- Place a Defense Token on a common location (max 1 per location).
- Japanese player may place workers as Samurai on their faction locations (max 1 per location). Samurai increase raze cost by 1.

#### 4. Clean-up Phase
- Use storage abilities to save goods.
- Discard all non-stored resources, workers, tokens, and goods used to activate actions.
- Cards in hand are kept.
- Samurai and technology tokens are retained.
- Pass the first player marker clockwise.
- Advance the round marker.

*Note: Skip clean-up in round 5; leftover goods count for tiebreakers.*

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Goods**: Include resources (food, wood, stone), workers, cards, VPs, tokens, and gold.
- **Gold**: Can substitute for any resource (but not vice versa). Cannot replace workers.
- **Location Types**:
  - *Production*: Provide goods when built and each Production Phase.
  - *Feature*: Provide passive abilities or trigger on actions.
  - *Action*: Require activation via cost; abilities used once or twice per round.
- **Building Costs**:
  - Common locations: Pay resources only.
  - Faction locations: Pay resources and discard a built location or foundation.
- **Raze Mechanics**:
  - Base cost: 1 (own hand), 2 (opponent’s location).
  - +1 raze token per defense token or samurai.
  - Razed common locations become foundations (face-down); Japanese faction locations are discarded.
- **Defense & Samurai**:
  - Defense tokens protect common locations; placed as free action.
  - Samurai protect Japanese faction locations; placed as free action; not discarded at round end.
- **Card Drawing**: Unless specified, player may choose deck (common or faction) when drawing.
- **Card Rules Override**: Specific card text takes precedence over general rules.
- **Self-Inclusion**: When counting locations for abilities (e.g., "each time you build a red location"), the newly built location counts itself.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
After round 5:
- **Scoring**:
  - 1 VP per Common Location.
  - 2 VPs per Faction Location.
  - Japanese Shrine and Gate may provide additional VPs.
- **Tiebreaker**:
  1. Most workers and resources.
  2. Most cards in hand.
  3. Shared victory if still tied.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hand Size**: No limit; cards in hand are secret.
- **Discard Piles**: Common and faction cards discarded to separate piles.
- **Deck Exhaustion**: Reshuffle discard pile to form new deck (except faction decks—no reshuffle if empty).
- **Foundation Use**: Can be used in place of a built location to pay faction building costs.
- **Defense Token Limits**: Max 1 per location, regardless of source.
- **Action Location Activation**: Goods used to activate are placed on the card and discarded in clean-up.
- **Simultaneous Effects**: Resolve in player order.
- **Card Clarifications**:
  - *Trade Route*: Deals with enemy locations remain even if Trade Route is lost.
  - *Temple of Ra*: Captured location cannot be discarded; if fully activated, new owner cannot use it again that round.
  - *Negotiator*: Allows building a deal card as a location without discarding another location.
  - *Settlers*: Allows building a faction location without discarding another location.
  - *Garrison/Engineers*: Remove location without razing; not subject to defense/samurai.
