## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the roles of Investigators working for Antares, a high-tech investigative agency operating under FBI jurisdiction. The team collaborates to solve modern crime cases across a campaign of five interconnected cases (six if including a standalone pre-order bonus case). Each case presents a mystery that must be unraveled through deduction, clue gathering, and resource management.  

The objective is to answer questions in the Final Report on the Antares Database website at the end of the final game day. Victory is determined by the team’s score, based on correct answers, matched evidence, and stress accumulated. The group wins or loses collectively depending on whether they meet the required point threshold for the case.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- The game proceeds over a fixed number of days (specified per case).  
- Each day has 8 working hours (8:00 AM – 4:00 PM).  
- Players act as a single team—no individual turns.  
- The group discusses and agrees on actions to perform.  
- Actions consume time (except browsing the database or internet).  
- When the Time Marker reaches 4:00 PM, players may:  
  - End the Day  
  - Work Overtime (until 7:00 AM)  

After ending the day:  
- Move the Day Marker forward  
- Reset the Time Marker to 8:00 AM  
- Return the IT marker to Headquarters  
- Remove all Used Ability tokens  
- Discuss findings and note pending leads  

The game ends at the end of the final day (after possible overtime). Then, the Final Report is completed online.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Time Management  
- Each action that takes time advances the Time Marker.  
- Travel between locations costs 1 hour.  
- At 4:00 PM, players may choose to work Overtime.  
- Each Overtime hour adds 1 Stress Token to the pool.  
- If Stress Tokens ≥ Stress Limit (set per case), the investigation ends immediately.  

#### Clues  
Three types of clues:  
1. **Lead Cards** (#103, etc.): Physical cards representing crime scenes, evidence, witnesses. Front side only unless instructed otherwise.  
2. **Antares Database (@ symbol)**: Online resource for files, questionings, signatures. Accessed via antaresdatabase.com.  
3. **General Knowledge (wifi symbol)**: Real-world internet research (e.g., Google, Wikipedia).  

#### Locations  
Five locations on the board:  
- **Headquarters (HQ)**: Central hub; research/interrogations (1–2 hrs)  
- **Richmond PD**: Old case files/evidence (2–3 hrs)  
- **The Lab**: Forensic analysis (up to 4 hrs)  
- **Courthouse**: Trial archives/consultants (2–3 hrs)  
- **Fieldwork**: Any other location (≥2 hrs)  

Travel between locations costs 1 hour. No travel cost if lead has no location listed.

#### Actions  
1. **Follow a Lead**  
   - Search the Case Deck for the specified card.  
   - Move IT marker if location differs (spend 1 hour).  
   - Advance Time Marker by card’s hour value.  
   - Read card aloud (back side hidden unless instructed).  
   - Follow all instructions (e.g., READ, CHOOSE, ADD PLOT CARD).  
   - Input any Signature into the Antares Database.  
   - Decide whether to Dig Deeper.  
   - Note Further Leads.  
   - Place card:  
     - Right side of board: only front side accessible  
     - Left side: both sides accessible (if Digged Deeper or flipped)  

2. **Dig Deeper**  
   - Spend required Skill Token to flip and read the back of a Lead Card.  
   - Decision must be made immediately after resolving the card.  
   - Token is permanently removed from the pool for the case.  

3. **Browse Antares Database**  
   - Follow @ prompts (e.g., NAME@JoeBloggs, QUESTIONING@032).  
   - Free—no time cost.  
   - Can be done any time, as often as needed.  
   - Never search without an @ instruction.  

4. **Browse the Internet**  
   - Triggered by underlined text + wifi icon.  
   - Use real-world sources (Google, Wikipedia, etc.).  
   - Free—no time cost.  
   - Optional but provides context.  

5. **Use an Ability**  
   - Each Investigator has a unique ability usable once per day.  
   - Mark used ability with an X token.  
   - Abilities can be used at any location.  
   - Examples:  
     - Jack Coleman: +2 Authority when writing a report  
     - Chris Stone: Dig Deeper on a resolved card (spend 1 Authority + Skill Token)  
     - Ben Harris: Spend 2 Authority to gain 1 Skill Token  
     - Julia Jacobson: Convert 1 Skill Token to 1 Wild  
     - Mia Roberts: Refresh another investigator’s ability (spend 1 Authority)  

6. **Write a Report**  
   - Spend 1 working hour at any location.  
   - Gain 1 Authority Token.  
   - Can only be done once per day, during working hours (not Overtime).  

#### Skill Tokens  
- Shared pool from Investigators and Consultants.  
- Do not refresh—limited supply for the entire case.  
- Types:  
  - Research: archives, research  
  - Technology: hacking, digital tools  
  - Questioning: interrogations, persuasion  
  - Perception: observation, evidence linking  
  - Wild: substitutes for any type  

#### Authority Tokens (★)  
- Represent team reputation.  
- Used to activate certain abilities or card actions (e.g., warrants).  
- Gained by writing reports or specific card effects.  
- Pool size is limited to physical tokens in the box.  

#### Signatures (Evidence Matching)  
Three types:  
- SD: Dactyloscopic (fingerprints)  
- SDNA: DNA (blood, hair, skin)  
- SM: Material (dirt, fabric, etc.)  

When found:  
- Input 12-character code (e.g., SDNA: KPUHVS-UDVZCB) into Antares Database > Signatures.  
- Incomplete characters shown as 'x'.  
- System helps match evidence to people or other evidence.  
- Mandatory—must be entered.  
- Matched evidence earns bonus points in scoring.  

#### Plot Cards  
- Represent connections to the overarching campaign.  
- When instructed, add Plot Card XXX to Case Y (place in correct zip bag without reading).  
- Indicates progress on the metaplot, even if off-track for current case.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The case ends at 4:00 PM (or after Overtime) on the final day.  
- Perform End of Day procedure.  
- Log into Antares Database and navigate to "Final Report".  
- Answer two sets of questions:  
  1. **Main Questions** – Case-specific (highest point value)  
  2. **Additional Questions** – Metaplot-related (lower point value)  

Scoring:  
- Correct answer: + points (value varies)  
- "I don't know": 0 points  
- Wrong answer: –1 point  
- Each matched evidence in Antares: + points (more than additional questions, less than main)  
- Each Stress Token collected: –1 point  

Final score is automatically calculated.  
- If score meets or exceeds target: **Win**  
- If not: **Lose** (can replay the case)  

After the game:  
- Undrawn cards cannot be reviewed.  
- Record which cards are accessible (front only or both sides).  
- Store used cards in insert for future reference (as notes only).  
- Keep all written notes—critical for campaign continuity.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can we replay a case?**  
  Yes. Reset the deck, return all tokens, and replay. Designed as "one and done" but replayable.  

- **When does stress end the game?**  
  Immediately after resolving the card that causes stress tokens to meet or exceed the limit.  

- **Can we use an ability after moving?**  
  Yes. Abilities can be used at any time during the day, at any location.  

- **Do we lose Authority Tokens permanently?**  
  Yes, when spent. They do not refresh.  

- **Can we Dig Deeper after resolving another lead?**  
  No. Decision must be made before following a new lead. Exception: if multiple leads are read via READ instruction, Dig Deeper decision can be delayed until all are read.  

- **Are components destroyed?**  
  No. No writing on components. Reset database and tokens to replay.  

- **Can multiple players access Antares Database?**  
  Yes, but use the same login to share data.  

- **What if a required Skill Token is unavailable?**  
  Cannot perform the action. Token supply is fixed.  

- **How to track accessible cards between cases?**  
  Use rubber bands, lists, or case title cards to separate front-only vs. both-sides accessible cards.  

- **Can we search the internet freely?**  
  Only on topics marked with the wifi icon. No unsolicited searches.
