## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *The Vale of Eternity*, players are monster tamers in a fantastical world, competing to capture the most powerful creatures from five families: Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, and Dragon. The ultimate goal is to amass the most victory points by summoning and utilizing creatures. The game ends when a player reaches 60 or more points or after the 10th round. The player with the most points wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Game Board (with family zones and round track)  
- 1 Score Board (scoring track up to 60+)  
- 70 Creature Cards (5 families, various effects)  
- 42 Magic Stones:  
  - 16 Red Stones (1 point each)  
  - 14 Blue Stones (3 points each)  
  - 12 Purple Stones (6 points each)  
- 8 Player Markers (2 per player)  
- 4 Player Tiles (1 per player)  
- 4 Score Markers (1 per player)  
- 1 First Player Marker  
- 1 Round Marker  
- Eternity Standee (optional)

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
   - 2 player markers  
   - 1 player tile  
   - 1 score marker  
2. Place the game board and score board in the center.  
3. Shuffle the 70 cards to form a draw pile; place near the board.  
4. Place magic stones in a supply next to the score board.  
5. Determine the first player (e.g., last to see a reptile); give them the first player marker.  
6. Place the round marker on round 1.  
7. Each player places their score marker on the scoring track at a value equal to their turn order (1st player at 1, 2nd at 2, etc.).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:  
1. **Hunting Phase**  
2. **Action Phase**  
3. **Resolution Phase**  
After each round, check endgame conditions. If not met, advance the round marker and pass the first player marker to the left.

#### 1. Hunting Phase  
1. Reveal 2 cards per player from the draw pile.  
   - If the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new one.  
2. Sort revealed cards by family (Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Dragon) in designated zones around the board.  
3. **First Draft (Clockwise):** Starting with the first player, each player places one of their markers on an unclaimed card.  
4. **Second Draft (Counter-Clockwise):** Starting with the last player, each player places their second marker on an unclaimed card.  
   - The last player places both markers consecutively.  
   - Each card can have only one marker.

#### 2. Action Phase  
Players take turns clockwise, starting with the first player. On their turn, a player may take any number of actions in any order. A turn ends only when all player markers have been retrieved (via Sell or Tame).  

**Available Actions:**  

- **Sell a Card**  
  - Retrieve one of your markers from a card.  
  - Discard that card.  
  - Gain magic stones based on the card’s **family**, not cost:  
    - Fire: 1 Red  
    - Water: 1 Blue  
    - Earth: 1 Purple  
    - Wind: 1 Red + 1 Blue  
    - Dragon: 1 Red + 1 Purple  
  - **Magic Stone Limit:** You may hold a maximum of 4 magic stones (any combination). Excess must be discarded immediately.  

- **Tame a Card**  
  - Retrieve one of your markers from a card.  
  - Add that card to your hand.  
  - There is **no hand limit**.  

- **Summon a Card**  
  - Pay the card’s summoning cost using magic stones (no change given).  
  - Place the card face-up in your play area (tableau).  
  - **Tableau Limit:** You may have at most **one card per round number** (e.g., 5 cards in round 5).  
  - **Cost Reduction:** Card effects may reduce cost, but cost cannot go below 0.  
  - **Instant Effect:** Immediately resolve any "Instant" effect (lightning bolt icon).  
    - The card itself is considered "in play" when resolving its effect.  
    - If any part of the Instant effect cannot be resolved, the card **cannot be summoned**.  
    - Permanent effects that trigger on summoning do **not** affect the card itself.  

- **Remove a Card**  
  - Pay magic stones equal to the **current round number**.  
  - Discard one of your summoned cards from your play area.  
  - Frees up space for future summons.  

- **Use Artifact Ability** *(Note: Artifact rules referenced in source but not fully detailed; assumed from player aid)*  
  - Use the ability of an Artifact card in your possession.  
  - Return the Artifact to the display with your square marker on it after use.

#### 3. Resolution Phase  
1. Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player activates **all Active effects** (sun icon) of their summoned cards **once per round**.  
   - Effects may be resolved in any order.  
   - All effects that can be resolved **must** be resolved.  
2. **Active effects include**: drawing cards, gaining points, forcing discards, etc.  
3. **Score cannot drop below 0**, even from negative effects.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Magic Stones**: Used to summon and remove cards. Values: Red (1), Blue (3), Purple (6). Max 4 in hand.  
- **Card Families**: Determine sell value and may trigger effects.  
- **Card Effects**:  
  - **Instant**: Triggers only upon summoning.  
  - **Permanent**: Always active once summoned.  
  - **Active**: Triggers once per round in Resolution Phase.  
- **Tableau Size**: Max = current round number.  
- **Card Priority**: Card effects override general rules when in conflict.  
- **Overpayment**: Allowed; no change returned.  
- **Drafting**: Snake draft — clockwise for first pick, counter-clockwise for second.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Conditions (checked after Resolution Phase):**  
- Any player has **60 or more victory points**, OR  
- The **10th round** has just ended.  
→ Game ends immediately.

**Victory Determination:**  
1. Player with the most points wins.  
2. **Tiebreaker 1**: Most summoned cards (largest tableau).  
3. **Tiebreaker 2**: Shared victory.

**Scoring Notes:**  
- Points are tracked on the score board.  
- Effects may increase or decrease score, but score cannot go below 0.  
- Flipping player tile indicates crossing 60+ points.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I overpay to summon a card?**  
  Yes, but you get no change.  
- **Can I summon a card if I can’t resolve its Instant effect?**

- **What happens if my hand is full and an effect forces me to draw?**  
  You may draw; there is no hand limit.

  Use substitutes (e.g., coins, dice).  
- **Can I trade magic stones?**  
  No, unless a card effect allows it.

  No. All markers must be retrieved before ending your turn.
