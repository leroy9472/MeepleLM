### 3. Setup
1. **Determine First Player**: Shuffle Fate cards and deal one to each player. The highest number determines P1.
2. **Choose Faction**: Starting with P1 and proceeding clockwise, each player chooses a faction and receives corresponding components.
3. **Map Setup**:
   - Remove "Setup Quest" cards from Quest deck and shuffle. Deal 2 to each player.
   - Players exchange Setup Quest cards for matching map tiles.
   - P1 places first tile in center. Players take turns placing one tile each until all non-home tiles are placed. Each tile must touch at least two areas of previously placed tiles. Mountain (red) or water (blue) borders cannot be adjacent to another red or blue border.
4. **Place Home Realm Markers**:
   - P1 places home realm setup markers adjacent to board edge (one per player). Each must touch at least three non-colored borders and have at least three areas between markers.
5. **Assign Home Realms**:
   - Starting with player to the left of P1, each replaces a home realm marker with their home realm tile (in any orientation, occupying the marker’s space). Home realms cannot be adjacent.
6. **Place Neutral Units**: Place neutral units as indicated on map areas.
7. **Place Cities**: Randomly place one city token face-up on each city space.
8. **Set Resources**: Set resource dials to red numbers on faction sheets.
9. **Distribute Starting Cards/Tokens**: Shuffle Tactics deck and give each player Tactics cards and Influence tokens as shown on faction sheet.
10. **Place Stronghold and Recruit Units**:
    - Starting with P1, each player places one Stronghold in any area of their home realm.
    - Recruit units using all three starting resources (via Recruit Order rules) and place them in home realm areas.
11. **Prepare Card Decks**:
    - Return unused Setup Quest cards to box. Add used ones back into Quest deck and shuffle.
    - Shuffle Fate, Quest, Reward, Tactics, Hero, Objective (Good/Evil), and Season decks.
    - Place Title cards face-up near decks.
12. **Distribute Initial Cards**:
    - Each player receives 2 Quest cards.
    - Each player receives 1 Hero card matching their alignment (Good/Evil).
    - Each player receives 1 Objective card matching their alignment.
13. **Place Dragon Runes**:
    - Each player receives 1 Dragon Rune and 1 False Rune token.
    - Starting with P1 and going counterclockwise, place these face-down in any two areas not adjacent to home realm markers and without existing Rune tokens.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game year consists of four seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter. Each season follows three steps:
1. **Resolve a Season Card**:
   - Draw top card from current Season deck.
   - Resolve primary ability (text).
   - Resolve secondary ability (icons), in play order.
2. **Choose Order Cards**:
   - Each player selects one Order card from hand and places it facedown.
3. **Resolve Order Cards**:
   - Reveal all Order cards simultaneously.
   - Resolve in play order (lowest number first; tiebreakers: most Influence, then highest starting Influence).
   - Resolve primary ability.
   - If the card is the player's highest-numbered card used this year, resolve Supremacy Bonus.

Repeat for four seasons per year, up to seven years unless someone wins earlier.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Movement
- **Strategize (#1)**: Move units/heroes into adjacent friendly or empty areas. Does not activate area.
- **Mobilize (#2) / Conquer (#3)**: Activate an area (place activation token), then move units/heroes from up to 2 areas away into it. Fast units may move up to 3 areas. Heroes may be moved.
- **Restrictions**:
  - No movement through enemy or neutral areas (except heroes).
  - Water (blue) and mountain (red) borders impassable unless flying or during Winter (water only).
  - Flying units ignore terrain but cannot move over enemy/neutral areas.
  - Units cannot move out of activated areas (except retreating).
  - Max 8 units per area (excluding heroes); excess destroyed unless during battle.

#### Diplomacy
Used when moving into area with unallied neutral units:
1. Spend 1–6 Influence tokens.
2. Draw Fate cards equal to Influence spent.
3. Choose and resolve one card’s destiny symbol:
   - **Gold (Ally)**: Neutral units become allied.
   - **Blue (Retreat)**: Neutrals retreat (chosen by player to left); destroyed if no valid retreat.
   - **Red (Battle/Retreat)**: Must battle or retreat all own units.

Allied neutrals act as own units, can move independently to friendly areas, and remain allied even if last own unit is killed (until end of battle).

#### Battles
Triggered when moving into enemy area or failing diplomacy.
1. **Place Battle Marker** in contested area.
2. **Place Units**: Players place units to right of faction sheet by initiative. Routed units and heroes do not participate.
3. **Start of Battle Abilities**: Attacker uses Tactics/start-of-battle abilities, then defender.
4. **Combat Rounds (by Initiative)**:
   - For each initiative level (1–5):
     a. **Draw Fate Cards**: Attacker chooses unit type, draws Fate cards = number of standing units. Refers to base shape (Triangle, Circle, Rectangle, Hexagon).
     b. **Defender Draws**: Same.
     c. **Resolve Special Abilities**: Starting with attacker, resolve special ability icons.
     d. **Resolve Routs**: Starting with attacker, each player routs number of figures equal to opponent’s rout icons. Undamaged units must be routed first.
     e. **Resolve Damage**: Starting with attacker, assign damage to opponent’s units. Must damage previously damaged units first, then standing, then routed.
     f. Repeat for remaining unit types of same initiative.
5. **Tally Strength**:
   a. Defender may use Fortification Development.
   b. Count standing units = Strength (routed hexagon units count as standing).
   c. Defender adds Stronghold strength.
   d. If attacker has standing units, flip Stronghold to damaged side.
6. **Resolution**:
   - Higher strength wins; tie = defender wins.
   - **Loser Retreats**: All participating units retreat and are routed. Units already routed at start are destroyed.
   - **Winner Options**:
     - If attacking Stronghold: may destroy or replace with own (damaged side up).
     - Remove all damage tokens.
     - Place winning units back (routed remain routed).
     - Remove Battle Marker.
   - Excess units (>8) after victory must retreat.

#### Heroes
- **Control Limit**: Max 3 Heroes (Commander not included unless variant).
- **Movement**:
  - During Quest Phase: up to 2 areas, through enemy/neutral areas.
  - Via Strategize/Mobilize/Conquer: into adjacent areas.
  - Routed heroes cannot move.
- **Quest Phase (Summer)**: Each hero may:
  - **Move** (then duel or attempt quest),
  - **Heal** (in friendly area),
  - **Train** (+1 to two attributes or +2 to one).
- **Duels**:
  - Occur only during Summer Quest Phase, after movement.
  - 4 rounds:
    a. Each player draws one Fate card.
    b. Resolve circle section:
       - Special: deal 1 damage or use Reward ability.
       - Rout: prevent damage = number of flags.
       - Damage: deal listed damage.
  - Damage remains on hero; defeated hero is removed, rewards go to victor.

#### Influence Bids

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Conditions**:
  - At any point, if a player controls 6 Dragon Runes:
    - Place faction’s Victory card face-down on current Season deck.
    - Next year, during that season, if still controlling 6 Runes → win.
    - Otherwise, take card back and resolve Season card.
  - If no one wins by end of Year 6, reveal all Runes; most Runes wins.
- **Tiebreakers**:

  2. Highest starting Influence (on faction sheet).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Hero Limits**: Max 3 Heroes. If gain 4th, choose one to desert.
- **Tactics Cards**: Cannot use in same season drawn. Max 10 in hand.
- **Quests**: Max 3 in hand. Complete → discard, draw new one. Fail → keep, retry later.
- **Retreats**:
  - Player units: to adjacent friendly, else empty, else destroyed.
  - Neutral units: to adjacent uncontrolled (chosen by player to left), else destroyed.
  - Heroes: any adjacent area.
- **Component Shortages**: Activation, damage, influence, training tokens, and defeated hero markers are unlimited (use proxies). Other components (units, strongholds) are limited; may destroy existing to build new.
- **Player Elimination**: If control zero areas → eliminated. Remove heroes, shuffle cards into decks, return Title cards (leave Influence on them).
