## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players are Temporal Agents working for the T.I.M.E. Agency (Tachyon Insertion in Major Events), tasked with preserving temporal continuity by projecting their consciousness into "receptacles" in various times and realities. The objective is to complete the mission by reading the Mission Success card. The game is cooperative: players win or lose together.

2. Components  
- 8 Agent Pawns (main and mini)  
- 1 Time Token (tracks Temporal Units)  
- 1 Group Token (indicates team location on PLAN)  
- 1 Time Captain Die (determines TU cost when changing locations)  
- 6 Action Dice (used in tests)  
- 40 Normal/Shield Tokens (20 white, 20 skull-side)  
- 7 Time Shields  
- 7 Heart Shields  
- 7 Special Shields  
- 140 Resource Tokens  
- 30 Life Points (LP)  
- 24 State Tokens  
- Mission Deck (contains Base, Location, Item, Receptacle, and Success/Failed cards)  
- 4 PLAN Cards (form a map)  
- Flash Cards (top and bottom of deck; not used in play)

3. Setup  
1. Place the board so all players can see it.  
2. Prepare supply piles:  
   - Normal/Shield Tokens (half white, half skull)  
   - Time, Heart, and Special Shields (sorted)  
   - Life Points and Resource Tokens (above board)  
   - State Tokens (left of board)  
3. Place near players:  
   - 6 Action Dice and Time Captain Die  
   - Time Token and Group Token  
4. Each player chooses an Agent Pawn and matching mini pawn.  
5. Prepare the Mission Deck:  
   - Remove flash cards (top and bottom).  
   - Place Base cards (A, B, etc.) on board from left to right.  
   - Remaining deck placed face down to the left of Base.  
6. Read Base cards aloud in order (no TU spent).  
7. Appoint initial Time Captain.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in repeated cycles until mission success or failure:  
Phase 1: Visit Location  
   A. Open Location  
   B. Explore Location  
Phase 2: Change Location  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Opening a Location**:  
  - Time Captain finds all cards of the chosen location (by card A’s name).  
  - Place cards face down (panorama side up) in alphabetical order.  
  - Read card A aloud (narrative and rules).  
  - No TU cost.  

- **Exploring a Location**:  
  - Players place Agent pawns on spaces above cards they wish to consult.  
  - Simultaneously reveal and read cards in occupied spaces (silently).  
  - Describe findings telepathically (paraphrase; do not show card).  
  - Exception: Read rule/technical text verbatim.  
  - Group discusses: spend 1 TU to act, or leave location.  
  - After acting or leaving, return cards to face-down position.  

- **Actions (after spending 1 TU)**:  
  Each player may:  
  - Make a Skill Test  
  - Move to another accessible space  
  - Do nothing  
  - Use Receptacle Special Action (if available)  

- **Skill Tests**:  
  - Type determined by icon (Deftness, Melee, Ranged, Magic).  
  - Difficulty shown in shields (Normal, Skull, Heart, Time, Special).  
  - Active player rolls dice equal to receptacle’s ability level (max 6).  
  - Hits (★) remove shields left to right.  
  - Riposte: if skulls rolled and skull shields remain, total skulls vs. resistance.  
    - If resistance < total skulls, lose 1 LP.  
  - Penalties: remaining shields apply:  
    - Heart: lose 1 LP each  
    - Time: lose 1 TU each  
    - Special: scenario-specific  
  - Multiple agents may attempt test; each rolls separately.  
  - Test resets only if group leaves location.  

- **Changing Location**:  
  1. Remove all Agent pawns.  
  2. Choose new location (from PLAN; cannot return immediately).  
  3. Stack current location cards (A on top), return to bottom of deck.  
  4. Time Captain rolls die (1–3 TU cost).  
     - If leaving red-name location: +2 TU.  
  5. Pass Time Captain die to player on left.  
  6. Open new location.  

- **Sealed Cards**:  
  - Cannot be entered or revealed unless conditions met:  
    - State Token icon: must possess token  
    - "All Agents": all agents must be present  
    - Specific Receptacle or Item: only that receptacle with item can enter  
    - Red No Entry: access blocked until game effect allows  
    - Orange Exclamation: at least one agent must go there immediately  
    - Pink Bin: discarded unless at least one agent is placed there  

- **Receptacle Death**:  
  - Remove agent’s pawn. Place mini pawn 7 TU ahead of time marker.  
  - Agent can discuss but not act.  
  - Possessions distributed to others.  
  - Re-enters when time marker reaches mini pawn (free, in space with another agent).  
  - Returns with full LP.  
  - If all receptacles die: immediate failure.  

- **Items**:  
  - Unlimited carry capacity.  
  - Can be traded when agents share space.  
  - Only one receptacle can use an item at a time.  
  - Items with Agency logo are retained between runs.  
  - Referred to by green number.  

- **State Tokens**:  
  - Shared by team.  
  - Gained through actions, items, or discoveries.  
  - Retained after use (e.g., to open sealed cards).  
  - Lost at end of run (unless Agency item).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win**: Read Mission Success card as instructed by game.  
- **Lose**:  
  - Time Token reaches 0 → read Failed Mission (TU) card.  
  - All receptacles die → read Failed Mission (TU) card.  
  - Specific failure condition triggered → read appropriate Failed card.  
- **Resetting After Failure**:  
  - Keep Agency-logo items.  
  - Reset all other elements (cards, tokens, LP, non-Agency items).  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you skip exploring a newly opened location?**  
  Yes. Group may choose to change location immediately.  
- **Do you reset a test if you leave the space but stay in the location?**  
  No. Test remains unless group leaves the entire location.  
- **What if a card says “reveal a sealed card”?**  
  Replace current card with the sealed card (no TU cost, no state token taken).  
- **Can you use an item not in your possession?**  
  No. Only receptacles holding the item can use it.  
- **Can you move and act in the same TU?**  
  Yes. Moving is an action.  
- **What if Time Captain dies?**  
  Pass die to next player when changing locations.  
- **Do blank dice faces count?**  
  No. Only ★ and skull matter.
