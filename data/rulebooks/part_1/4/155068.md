4. Gameplay Flow
A round consists of three phases:
1. Hero Phase
2. Monster Phase
3. Clean-Up Phase

5. Core Mechanics
Hero Phase:
- Use each hero once per round; mark used heroes with guild token above character card.
- Heroes can either Activate or Rest.
- Activating: Spend 3 Movement Points and 1 Attack.
- Resting: Clear exhaust tokens, return dead hero to starting area, give non-quest tokens to guild mates (cannot receive), move equipment among own cards.
- Guard Reactions: Triggered when moving near or attacking monsters; monster attacks before hero continues.
- Payback Reactions: Triggered after being hit by attack; monster attempts to move to attacker's space and attack.
- Activation Limits: Minor Minions (1), Major Minions (2), Villains (3) per round.
- Multiple Target Attacks: Highest ranked surviving monster takes payback reaction (Villains > Majors > Minors); ties broken by Monster Row position (left favored).

Monster Phase:
Step 1: Left to right along Monster Row, closest monster of each type with activations remaining takes Guard Reaction (no movement) on hero using Target Priority.
Step 2: Reveal top card from Monster Activation Deck. Closest monster of revealed type with activations remaining performs Payback Reaction (attempts to move to target). Number of Step 2 actions:
- Missions 1-2: Once
- Missions 3-4: Twice
- Missions 5-6: Three times
- If deck empty, reshuffle discard and add coin beside deck.

Monster Target Priority:
1. Closest hero
2. Lowest remaining health
3. Lowest armor pool (Dazed = 0)
4. Most loot tokens (Quest tokens count as 2)
5. Lowest reroll pool
6. Leftmost tied hero on hero sheet

Clean-Up Phase:
1. [Death Token] If Spawn Board full, spawn only first-position monster. Move all monsters down one slot.
2. [Coin] Remove coins from Spawn Board equal to number beside Monster Activation Deck (start with 1). Take from slot 4 first, then slot 5. If no coins on board, lose from collected coins. Failure to pay ends campaign.
3. [Guild Token] Clear all guild tokens from heroes and monsters.

6. Scoring & End Game
- Monster kills grant coins: keep 1, excess go to slot 5 of Spawn Track (lost if slot 5 empty).
- Complete scenario by finishing 2 PvE quests: receive all gold remaining on Spawn Board.
- Earn rewards/titles only if at least one coin remains on Spawn Board when completing quest.
- Campaign ends if unable to pay coin cost during Clean-Up Phase.
- Upgrade Phase: Lose 1 coin per Death Token on heroes. Failure ends campaign.
- After completing final quest with coin on Spawn Board: choose next mission. Otherwise: randomly pick next mission.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- Door to Starting Area is closed to all monsters for LOS and movement.

- Monsters don't use portals.
- When drawing from empty Monster Activation Deck: reshuffle discard and add coin beside deck.
- Equipment effects on monsters: 
  - Exhaust card: +1 activation token
  - Exhaust all cards: maximum activation tokens
  - Bonus with exhausted cards: bonus if any activation tokens present
  - Choice attacks: roll die; crit = take extra wounds, else choose not to
- Bomb tokens trigger when monster moves into space with guild token.
- Shield of Souls resurrection follows multiplayer rules (can resurrect near instead of starting area).
- Hobsbawn's Blessing and Battle Cry allow extra activation (not rest) without activation token.
- Abilities immune to Guard Reactions (e.g., Wisp) are ignored during Monster Phase Step 1.
- Potions allow turn without used token.
- Final Showdown: gain all coins from kills, treasure chests become coins immediately, lose 1 coin per hero death.
