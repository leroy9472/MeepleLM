## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are a cryptozoologist hunting for definitive proof of a cryptid in the wilds of North America. Each player holds a unique clue about the creature’s habitat. The goal is to be the first to deduce the single hex on the map that satisfies all players’ clues. The first player to correctly identify and search this space wins.

### 2. Components  
- 6 numbered map tiles (hexagonal spaces with terrain: desert, forest, water, mountain, swamp)  
- 5 sets of player tokens: coloured cubes and discs (one set per player)  
- 4 Standing Stones (octagonal markers, in white, green, blue, black)  
- 4 Abandoned Shacks (triangular markers, in white, green, blue, black)  
- 54 Cards (3–5 players):  
  - Clear border: normal game  
  - Black border: advanced game  
- 5 Clue Books (one per player)  
- 1 Pawn (used during questioning and searching)

### 3. Setup  
1. **Choose Game Mode**:  
   - **Normal Mode**: Only positive clues; 3 structures of each type used.  
   - **Advanced Mode**: May include negative clues (e.g., “not within two spaces of bear territory”); all 4 structures of each type are used.  

2. **Construct the Map**:  
   - Shuffle the appropriate deck (clear or black border) and draw one card.  
   - Use the card’s diagram to:  
     - Place the 6 map tiles in numbered positions (1–6).  
     - Rotate each tile so the numbered corner aligns with the dot on the card.  
     - Place Standing Stones and Abandoned Shacks as indicated.  

3. **Assign Clues**:  
   - Flip the card to the back.  
   - Find the row matching the number of players (3, 4, or 5).  
   - Each player takes a clue book corresponding to one of the symbols in that row.  
   - Each player finds the numbered clue in their book (matching the number in their column).  
   - Clues are kept secret. All clues are different.

4. **Distribute Playing Pieces**:  
   - Each player receives a set of cubes and discs in their colour.  
   - Choose a starting player (e.g., the one who set up the map).

5. **Initial Sharing**:  
   - Starting player places one cube on a hex that **cannot** be the habitat, per their clue.  
   - Proceed clockwise; each player places one such cube.  
   - Repeat: each player places a second cube (same rule).  
   - Cubes may be placed on spaces with structures but not on spaces with another player’s cube.  
   - After all cubes are placed, the starting player begins the first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Players take turns clockwise.  
- On your turn, choose **one** action:  
  1. **Question** another player about a space.  
  2. **Search** a space to attempt victory.  
- After the action, unless you win, the turn passes left.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Playing Pieces  
- **Cube (No)**: This space **cannot** be the habitat, according to your clue.  
  - Only one cube per space (any player).  
  - Once placed, cubes are never removed.  
- **Disc (Yes)**: This space **could** be the habitat, according to your clue.  
  - Multiple discs may occupy one space (stacked).  
  - You cannot place a second piece on a space where you already have a piece.

#### General Rules  
- **Honesty**: You must place cubes and discs truthfully based on your clue.  
- **No Interaction with Cubed Spaces**: You cannot question, search, or place pieces on any space with a cube.  
- **Cube Reciprocity**: If your action causes another player to place a cube, **you must place one of your cubes** on a different space that cannot be the habitat per your clue.  
- **No Duplicates**: You cannot place a second piece (of any type) on a space where you already have a piece.

#### Questioning  
- Place the pawn on any legal space (no cube present).  
- Ask **one** other player: “Could the creature be here?”  
- The questioned player:  
  - Places a **disc** if the space could be the habitat per their clue.  
  - Places a **cube** if it cannot.  
- If they place a cube, **you must place one of your cubes** elsewhere.  
- Turn ends; play passes left.

#### Searching  
- Place the pawn on a space that **could be the habitat per your clue** and has no cube.  
- Place **one of your discs** on the space.  
  - If your disc is already there, place it on a different legal space (could be habitat, no cube, no your piece).  
- Ask each other player clockwise: “Could the creature be here?”  
  - If a player already has a disc there, they **pass**.  
  - Otherwise, they place a disc (yes) or cube (no) per their clue.  
- **If any player places a cube**:  
  - Stop immediately.  
  - **You must place one of your cubes** elsewhere.  
  - Turn ends; play passes left.  
- **If all players place discs (or pass)**:  
  - You have found the habitat. **You win immediately.**

#### Clue Types  
Each clue defines which spaces could be the habitat. All are based on **distance** from board elements.  
A space is **0 spaces away** from itself.  

1. **On One of Two Terrain Types**  
   - Example: “The habitat is on forest or swamp.”  
   - Discs: all forest and swamp spaces.  
   - Cubes: all other terrain.

2. **Within One Space of a Terrain Type**  
   - Includes the terrain itself and all adjacent hexes.  
   - Example: “Within one space of desert.”  
   - Discs: all desert and adjacent spaces.  
   - Cubes: all others.

3. **Within One Space of Either Animal Territory**  
   - Animal territories: bear (dotted) or cougar (solid).  
   - Discs: all spaces within one space of bear **or** cougar territory.  
   - Cubes: all others.

4. **Within Two Spaces of a Structure Type**  
   - Structure types: Standing Stone or Abandoned Shack.  
   - Colour irrelevant.  
   - Includes the structure’s space and all within two hexes.  
   - Example: “Within two spaces of a Standing Stone.”

5. **Within Two Spaces of an Animal Territory Type**  
   - Only the specified type (bear or cougar) counts.  
   - May be negative: “Not within two spaces of bear territory.”  
   - Example: “Within two spaces of cougar territory.”  
   - Discs: all spaces within two hexes of any cougar territory.  
   - Cubes: all others (or vice versa for negative clues).

6. **Within Three Spaces of a Structure Colour**  
   - Structure types: Standing Stone or Abandoned Shack.  
   - Type irrelevant; colour matters (white, green, blue, black).  
   - Includes the coloured structure’s space and all within three hexes.  
   - Example: “Within three spaces of a blue structure.”

**Note**: Players never receive identical clues.

#### Mistakes  
- If a player realizes they placed a cube instead of a disc (or vice versa):  
  - Announce the mistake immediately.  
  - Replace the incorrect piece with the correct one.  
  - Move the removed piece to a **legal** space (per clue, no cube, no own piece).  
- This can happen during any player’s turn.

#### Hints  
- If all players agree (or all but one in 4–5 player games), a hint may be taken.  
- Using **cards**: Check the number on the setup card and find the corresponding hint in the rulebook.  
- Using **app**: Follow on-screen instructions at www.playcryptid.com.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is **no scoring**.  
- The game ends **immediately** when a player searches a space and all other players place discs (or pass).  
- That player **wins**.  
- After victory, players may compare clues to confirm correctness.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I question a space I know is invalid?**  
  Yes. Useful for bluffing or probing others’ knowledge.  
- **Can I search a space with a structure?**  
  Yes, as long as it fits your clue and has no cube.  
- **What if I have no legal space to place a required cube?**  
  This should not happen if clues are followed correctly. If it does, recheck your clue.  
- **Can I place a disc on a space with another player’s disc?**  
  Yes. Stack your disc on top.  
- **Do animal territories block movement or vision?**  
  No. They are only reference zones for clues.  
- **Can I use pen and paper?**  
  Yes. Highly recommended for tracking others’ clues.
