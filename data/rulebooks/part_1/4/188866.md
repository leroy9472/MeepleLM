## AWKWARD GUESTS — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Awkward Guests*, players are investigators attempting to solve the murder of Mr. Walton at his mansion. Each guest has hidden motives, secrets, and possible involvement. The objective is to deduce the full truth: **WHO** committed the murder, **WHY** (motive), **HOW** (weapon/method), and whether there was an **ACCOMPLICE** (in advanced play). Correctly identifying all elements wins the game.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Choose a Case**: Select a case from the rulebook or app. Gather and shuffle the 70 specified clue cards face down into a draw deck.  
2. **Deal Hands**: Each player receives 6 random cards from the deck.  
3. **Place Components**:  
   - Place the draw deck and discard tray near the center.  
   - Put the mansion map where all players can see it.  
   - Distribute player screens, tracking sheets, and writing tools.  
   - Place inquiry and offer tokens within reach.  
4. **Determine Starting Player**: The host selects the “most awkward guest” as the first active player. Give them the starting player standee.  

> *Solo/Co-op Setup (via App)*: Use the app to generate a random case. Players begin with 0 points; each clue viewed deducts points. Solve before running out.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in **five phases**:

#### 1. Inquiry Phase  
- The **active player** places **2 inquiry tokens** (arrows) on the map or suspect list to indicate **two categories of interest** (e.g., “Greg Gaffney” and “Kitchen”).  
- In **2-player games**, the active player must specify **4 categories**.  
- Categories may be: **Guests, Rooms, Motives, Weapons, or Signs** (e.g., defensive wounds).

#### 2. Offer Phase  
- All **other players**, starting with the player to the right of the active player and proceeding **anti-clockwise**, may make offers.  
- To offer: place **face-down cards** from hand that each match **at least one** of the inquiry categories.  
- Place an **offer token** showing the **total value** of the offered cards (sum of individual card values).  
- Players may choose **not to offer** any cards.  
- Once placed, offers **cannot be changed or withdrawn**.

#### 3. Exchange Phase  
- The active player chooses which offers (if any) to accept.  
- To accept an offer, they must **give cards from their hand** totaling **equal or greater value** than the offer.  
  - These cards may be **any cards**, not necessarily matching the inquiry.  
  - Exchanged cards are **not revealed** until later (e.g., upon elimination).  
- The active player may accept **multiple offers**, but **must pay each fully** before viewing any received cards.  
- **If no player makes an offer**:  
  - The active player **draws 3 cards** (2 in 2-player game) from the draw deck.  
- After exchanges/draws, received cards go into the active player’s hand.

> *Note (2-player variant)*: Exchanged or drawn cards are **discarded after viewing**.

#### 4. Solution Phase (after all players have had a turn)  
- All players **simultaneously** place their **case-solving token** in hand:  
  - **White side up** = attempting to solve  
  - **Brown/dark side up** = continue investigating  
- Reveal tokens.  
- If **any player chose white**, proceed to **Solution Check**:  
  - Each solving player **privately writes** their solution:  
    - **Who** killed Mr. Walton  
    - **Motive**  
    - **Weapon/Method**  
    - **Accomplice?** (Only in advanced difficulty; beginner/easy assume none)  
  - Check solution via **app** or **rulebook solution table**.  
    - **Correct**: Player wins. Game ends unless others also solve correctly.  
    - **Incorrect**:  
      - *With app*: Player remains in game but **cannot attempt to solve in the next round**.  
      - *Without app*: Player is **eliminated**. Their hand is revealed to all, then discarded face up to a "revealed cards" pile.  
- If **no one solves**, continue to Discard Phase.

#### 5. Discard Phase  
- All remaining players **discard down to 3 cards** (chosen freely).  
- Discarded cards go **face down** under the Classified Information card in the discard tray.  
- Pass the **starting player standee** to the right.  
- The new starting player **deals cards** so all players have **6 cards** in hand.  
- Begin the next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Values & Clues  
- Each clue card has a **point value** (1–4), indicated by symbols (M, G, S, A).  
- Cards provide references to:  
  - Suspects (e.g., Claudette Cazelar)  
  - Locations (e.g., Kitchen, Shed)  
  - Motives (e.g., Stolen Recipe, Child Neglect)  
  - Weapons (e.g., Machete, Poison)  
  - Forensic signs (e.g., Defensive Wounds, Traces of Dark Powder)  

#### Truth & Deception  
- **Police, Forensics, Staff**: Always truthful.  
- **Innocent Guests**: Never lie.  
- **Murderer (and Accomplice in advanced)**: May lie — clues involving them may be false.  
- Players must **track consistency** across clues to identify deception.

#### Deck Exhaustion  
- When the draw deck runs out:  
  1. **Shuffle all discarded cards** (including face-down pile).  
  2. **Reveal the top 3 cards** — all players may view and record these clues.  
  3. **Discard these 3 face down** into a new discard pile.  
  4. Remaining cards form the new draw deck.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition**: Be the first to **correctly identify** all four elements:  
  - Killer  
  - Motive  
  - Weapon/Method  
  - Accomplice (if applicable)  
- **Multiple winners possible** if more than one player solves correctly in the same round.  
- **Elimination**:  
  - In non-app mode, incorrect solvers are **eliminated**.  
  - If only one player remains, they **automatically win**.  
- **Game ends** when:  
  - At least one player solves correctly, OR  
  - Only one player remains in the game.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I offer cards that don’t match the inquiry?**  
A: No. All offered cards must match **at least one** of the inquiry categories.

A: Yes! Any player may attempt to solve during the Solution Phase, regardless of turn order.

**Q: Are revealed cards from eliminated players public?**  
A: Yes. All players may examine and record information from eliminated players’ hands.
