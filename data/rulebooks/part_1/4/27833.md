# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In Steam, players take on the role of railroad tycoons building rail networks across 19th-century industrial regions. The goal is to deliver goods efficiently along completed track links to score Victory Points (VPs). Victory is determined by having the most VPs at the end of the game, with ties broken by income level and final turn action tile selection.

## 2. Components
- Double-sided game board (USA/Canada and Rhine/Ruhr maps)
- 136 hexagonal track tiles in various configurations
- 96 Goods cubes (20 each of red, blue, yellow, purple; 16 gray)
- 7 Action tiles
- 9 City Growth markers
- 8 New City tiles
- 144 Player tokens (24 each in 6 colors)
- 67 Money tokens ($1, $5, $10 denominations)
- Goods bag
- Turn marker
- Income Track, Victory Point Track, Locomotive Level track
- Turn Order Display and Game Turn Track

## 3. Setup
1. Choose map side based on player count: USA/Canada for 3-4 players, Rhine/Ruhr for 4-5 players.
2. Place goods cubes:
   - Randomly draw and place cubes on each city according to the number printed on the city hex.
   - For 3-player games on the Ruhr map, place one fewer cube per city.
   - Place 3 random cubes on each Goods Supply space (2 cubes for 3-player games).
3. Place City Growth markers and New City tiles next to the board.
4. Each player takes a set of tokens in one color and places:
   - One token on the 0 space of the Income Track
   - One token on the 0 space of the Victory Point Track
   - One token on Locomotive Level 1
5. Place the turn order marker on space 1 of the Turn Order Track.
6. Determine first-player order:
   - Base Game: Auction each position starting with position 1. Randomly determine starting bidder, then proceed clockwise. Players bid or pass; winner pays and claims position. Last position is free.
   - First game variant: Randomly determine order by drawing Action tiles; lowest number goes first. Second player receives $1, third $2, etc.
7. Place Action tiles:
   - Base Game: With Turn Order values face-up
   - Standard Game: With blank side face-up

## 4. Gameplay Flow

### Base Game Phases:
1. **Select Action Tiles**: Players choose one Action tile in turn order.
2. **Build Track**: Players build up to 3 track tiles (4 if Engineer was selected) in turn order (First Build goes first).
3. **Move Goods or Improve Locomotive (2 rounds)**: In turn order, players perform one action per round: move a goods cube, improve locomotive (once per phase), or pass. First Move tile holder goes first each round.
4. **Collect Income & Pay Expenses**: Players collect income or pay expenses based on Income Track position.
5. **Determine Turn Order**: Next round's order is set by Action tile numbers (lowest goes first).
6. **Setup New Turn**: Return Action tiles and advance turn marker.

### Standard Game Phases:
1. **Buy Capital**: Players reduce Income Level to gain $5 per level reduced (in turn order).
2. **Determine Order of Play**: Players bid for turn order. First and second pay full bid, last pays nothing, others pay half (rounded up).
3. **Select Action Tiles**: Same as Base Game.
4. **Build Track**: Same as Base Game.
5. **Move Goods or Improve Locomotive (2 rounds)**: Same as Base Game.
6. **Collect Income & Pay Expenses**: Collect income/pay expenses, then pay $1 per Locomotive Level.
7. **Setup New Turn**: Return Action tiles and advance turn marker.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Action Tiles
- **Turn Order**: Go first next round (Base) or pass once in bidding without dropping out (Standard)
- **First Move**: Go first in Move Goods phase
- **Engineer**: Build up to 4 track tiles
- **First Build**: Go first in Build Track phase
- **City Growth**: Add goods from supply to any city without marker ($2 cost in Base, must decide immediately)
- **Locomotive**: Increase locomotive level by 1 ($4 + new level cost in Base)
- **Urbanization**: Convert town to city and add goods ($6 cost in Base)

### Track Building
- Must start from city or extend existing track
- Pay costs: $1 per track exit, $1 for town, $1 for river, $2 for hills
- Cannot build on cities or cross thick black lines
- Incomplete links not extended on next turn become unowned
- Redirecting/improving track pays only non-terrain costs
- May claim unowned incomplete links by extending from city or own network

### Goods Movement
- Deliver cube to first city of matching color
- Maximum links traveled = locomotive level
- Must use own links at least as much as any single opponent's links
- Score 1 track point per owned link used
- Active player decides first whether to take points as income or VPs (all points one way)

### Financing
- **Base Game**: Take $5 from bank when needed, moving down 1 space on Income Track. At -$10, reduce VP by 2 per $5 taken.
- **Standard Game**: Buy capital only in Phase 1. Cannot raise money during other phases.

### Bankruptcy
- **Base Game**: At -$10 income with insufficient VPs to cover costs, player is eliminated. Completed links become unowned.
- **Standard Game**: If unable to pay with cash, VPs, and income track, player is bankrupt and eliminated.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
Game length: 10 turns (3 players), 8 turns (4 players), 7 turns (5-6 players). On final turn, skip turn order determination and tile return.

Final scoring:
- +1 VP per 2 positive income (rounded down)
- -2 VP per negative income point
- +1 VP per completed link owned
- Incomplete links score nothing

Winning: Highest VP total wins. Tiebreakers: highest income, then lowest-numbered Action tile in final round.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Action Tile Passing**: City Growth and Urbanization allow passing (flip tile, no cost). This decision is final when tile is selected.
- **Track Ownership**: Completed links never change ownership. Incomplete links lost if not extended next turn.
- **Multiple Players Scoring**: When a goods cube uses multiple players' tracks, each scores points for their links and decides independently whether to take as income or VPs (active player first, then turn order).
- **Urbanization**: Removes any existing town track tile. New City tile does not count as a build action.
- **Turn Order Auctions**: In Standard Game, Turn Order tile allows one free pass during bidding phase.
