# Chinatown — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Set in 1930s New York during the economic recovery, players take on the roles of entrepreneurs establishing and expanding businesses in Chinatown. The goal is to accumulate the most money over six rounds by building and completing businesses such as laundries, restaurants, antique shops, and chemists. Strategic trading, placement, and timing determine success.

### 2. Components
- 1 Game Board (Chinatown with 85 building plots)
- 150 Player Counters (30 per player in up to 5 colors)
- 90 Business Tiles (12 types, each requiring 3–6 tiles to complete)
- 85 Building Plot Cards (one for each plot)
- 9 Business Outlook Cards (economic situation cards)
- 81 Money Cards ($1000, $5000, $10000, $20000)
- 5 Player Aid Cards
- Starting Cash: $5000 per player
- Start Player Token

### 3. Setup
1. Place the board in the center.
2. Shuffle the 90 Business Tiles and place them face-down in 4 stacks beside the board.
3. Sort money cards by denomination and form a bank.
4. Shuffle the 85 Building Plot Cards and place them face-down.
5. Shuffle the 9 Business Outlook Cards; place 6 face-down beside the board (1 revealed per round), 3 discarded.
6. Each player:
   - Chooses a color and takes 30 counters.
   - Takes a Player Aid Card.
   - Receives $5000 in starting cash.
7. Determine starting player and give them the Start Player Token.
8. Optional: Decide on business placement order (simultaneous or turn-based). If turn-based, use the Start Player Token.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the 6 rounds consists of 5 phases:

#### Phase 1: Deal Building Cards
- Refer to the Player Aid Card for number of cards to draw based on player count and round.
- Each player draws the larger number of Building Cards.
- Each player discards 2 cards, keeps the smaller number.
- Discarded cards are shuffled back into the Building Deck.
- Players reveal kept cards and place their colored markers on corresponding plots, claiming ownership.
- Kept Building Cards are removed from the game.

#### Phase 2: Distribute Business Tiles
- Players draw business tiles from the stacks:
  - Round 1: Draw the larger number (per Player Aid).
  - Rounds 2–6: Draw the smaller number.
- No hand limits; tiles are kept face-up.

#### Phase 3: Trade
- Players may trade:
  - Building Plot Cards (and ownership of plots)
  - Business Tiles (hand or on board)
  - Cash
  - Non-binding future promises (e.g., “I’ll give you a tile later”)
- Trades can involve any number of players.
- Agreements must be fulfilled immediately; future promises are not enforceable.
- Ownership markers change when buildings are traded.
- Business tiles on the board cannot be moved but may change ownership.
- Trading ends when all players agree to stop.

#### Phase 4: Place Business Tiles
- Players may place any number of business tiles (including zero) on plots they own.
- Placement order:
  - If turn-based: Starting player places first, then clockwise.
  - If simultaneous: All place at once.
- Place a tile, then place a colored counter on top to mark ownership.
- Unplaced tiles remain in hand for future rounds.

#### Phase 5: Distribute Income
1. Reveal the top Business Outlook Card:
   - If it grants bonus income (e.g., “+1000 per Restaurant tile”), pay $1000 per qualifying tile (finished or unfinished).
   - Discard the card after use.
2. Pay base income from the bank:
   - Calculate income for each business based on size and completion (see Player Aid).
   - All income is paid from the bank; cash is kept secret.

End of round: Move to next round. After Round 6, proceed to Game End.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Business Formation**:
  - Business Tiles of the same type placed orthogonally adjacent (not diagonal) form a business.
  - Separated by streets → not adjacent.
  - Same player only; opponent tiles do not merge.
- **Completion**:
  - Each business type has a maximum size (3, 4, 5, or 6 tiles).
  - Reaching maximum = “Finished” → higher income.
  - Below maximum = “Unfinished” → lower income.
  - Single and double-tile businesses are always unfinished.
  - Cannot exceed maximum size; excess tiles form a new business.
- **Tile Limits**:
  - For each business type: total tiles = max size + 3.
  - E.g., Pharmacy (max 3): 6 tiles → allows two finished 3-tile businesses.
  - E.g., Restaurant (max 4): 7 tiles → allows one 4-tile and one 3-tile (unfinished), or similar.
- **Reconfiguration**:
  - Players may rearrange unplaced tiles to form optimal configurations.
  - Once placed, tiles cannot be moved, but ownership can change via trade.
  - Example: Two separate 3-tile seafood businesses can be reformed from scattered tiles if all are owned.
- **Street Access Variant (Optional)**:
  - New businesses must be placed on plots with street access unless expanding an existing business.
  - Plots 1,2,5,6,9,10,13–27,28–42,43–58,59–74,83 have street access.
  - Other plots (e.g., 3,4,7,8,11,12,20,32–38, etc.) do not.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- The game ends after income is paid in Round 6.
- The player with the most cash wins.
- Tiebreaker: Player with the most business tiles on the board.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I keep unplaced business tiles?**  
  Yes. Unplaced tiles remain in hand for future rounds.
- **Can I add a tile to a finished business?**  
  No. A new tile of the same type placed adjacent to a finished business starts a new business.
- **Can two players’ adjacent businesses merge?**  
  No. Only same-player, same-type, orthogonally adjacent tiles form a business.
- **Can I trade a building with a business on it?**  
  Yes. Trade includes ownership of the plot and any business tile on it. Move the ownership marker.
- **Are trades public?**  
  No. Trades may be open or secret. Results are revealed only when markers/tiles change hands.
- **Can I sell a business tile that’s already on the board?**  
  Yes, via trade. The tile stays in place; ownership changes via counter or agreement.
- **What happens if I draw a building card I don’t want?**  
  You may trade it away during Phase 3.
- **Can I place a business tile on a plot I don’t own?**  
  No. Only on plots you own (via Building Card and marker).
- **Do Business Outlook bonuses apply to unfinished businesses?**  
  Yes. All qualifying tiles receive the bonus, regardless of completion.
