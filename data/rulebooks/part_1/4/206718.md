## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the land of Ethnos, the old Age has ended and the Six Kingdoms lie empty. Twelve Tribes are scattered, and players compete to become the next Lord of Ethnos by uniting these Tribes into powerful alliances. The goal is to earn the most Glory (victory points) over multiple Ages by controlling Kingdoms and playing Bands of Allies. The player with the most Glory at the end of the game is crowned Lord of Ethnos and wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Main Game Board (6 Kingdoms: Duris, Rhea, Ithys, Straton, Althea, and Penda)  
- 12 Setup Cards (one per Tribe)  
- 18 Glory Tokens (numbered 2–6; some marked “4+”)  
- 12 Tribe Decks (12 cards each, except Halflings: 24 cards)  
- 3 Dragon Cards  
- 6 Orc Horde Boards  
- 1 Double-Sided Merfolk Board (normal and 2–3 player side)  
- 1 Double-Sided Giant Token (values by player count)  
- 6 Troll Tokens (numbered 1–6)  
- 26 Control Markers per player color  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the main board in the center.  
2. Shuffle Glory tokens face down. Randomly place three in each Kingdom, then flip and arrange in ascending order: “I” (lowest), “II”, “III” (highest).  
   - For 2–3 players: Remove “4+” tokens; use only two tokens per Kingdom.  
3. Each player chooses a color and takes 26 Control markers. Place one marker per player on the “0” space of the Glory Track.  
4. Shuffle Setup Cards and reveal six (five for 2–3 players). Take the matching Tribe decks and shuffle them together to form the Allies Deck. Return unused decks and cards to the box.  
5. Additional setup if applicable:  
   - **Merfolk**: Place Merfolk board (correct player-side up). Each player places a marker on “0”.  
   - **Trolls**: Place all six Troll tokens beside the board.  
   - **Giants**: Place Giant token beside board (correct side up).  
   - **Orcs**: Give each player an Orc Horde board.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game is played over **three Ages** (two Ages for 2–3 players). Each Age proceeds as follows:  
1. **Beginning a New Age**  
2. **Playing Through an Age** (turns)  
3. **End of an Age** (scoring)  
4. **A New Age Dawns** (or End of Game)  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Beginning a New Age  
1. Each player draws one card from the Allies Deck.  
2. Reveal face-up cards equal to **2 × player count** (e.g., 8 for 4 players).  
3. Split the Allies Deck in half. Shuffle the three Dragon cards into the **bottom half only**, then stack the halves (Dragons in lower portion).  
4. Determine First Player:  
   - **First Age**: Randomly choose.  
   - **Second/Third Age**: Player with the least Glory on the track.  
     - Tie: The tied player closest clockwise to the player who drew the third Dragon card in the prior Age.  

#### Playing Through an Age  
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, choose **one** action:  

**Option 1: Recruit One Ally**  
- Draw one card: either from the face-up row or from the top of the Allies Deck.  
- **Hand Limit**: You cannot recruit if you have 10 cards. You must Play a Band.  
- **Dragon Cards**:  
  - If drawn, reveal it immediately and place beside the board.  
  - Draw a replacement card.  
  - First two Dragons have no effect.  
  - **Third Dragon drawn = End of Age** (immediate).  

**Option 2: Play a Band of Allies**  
A Band is 1–10 cards from your hand. All cards must be:  
- The **same Tribe** (same name/art), **or**  
- The **same color** (same Kingdom).  

Steps:  
1. Lay down the chosen cards in front of you.  
2. Choose one card to be the **Leader** and place it on top.  
3. **Place Control Marker**:  
   - You may place one of your Control markers in the Kingdom matching the **Leader’s color**.  
   - Requirement: The number of cards in your Band > your current number of Control markers in that Kingdom.  
     - Example: To place your 3rd marker in a Kingdom, your Band must have at least 4 cards.  
   - **Exception – 2-player games**: You need more cards than the **total** number of Control markers (all players) in the Kingdom.  
4. **Use Leader Ability**: Only the Leader’s special ability may be used.  
5. **Discard Remaining Hand**: All cards left in hand are discarded face up beside the board (available for future recruitment).  
6. Leave the Band in front of you (visible) until the end of the Age.  

#### Tribe Abilities (Leader Only)  
- **Centaurs**: If you place a Control marker, play another Band immediately (before discarding).  
- **Dwarves**: Band scores Glory as if it had one more card.  
- **Elves**: Keep up to X cards (X = Band size); discard the rest.  
- **Giants**: If your Band is now the largest with a Giant Leader, gain 2 Glory and take the Giant token. At end of Age, gain bonus Glory based on Age (shown on token).  
- **Halflings**: Cannot place Control markers. Halfling Tribe has 24 cards (easier to form large Bands).  
- **Merfolk**: Move your Merfolk board marker up X spaces (X = Band size). If you land on/past a marker symbol, place an additional Control marker anywhere. At end of each Age, top players on Merfolk board score Glory like a Kingdom. Board is not reset.  
- **Minotaurs**: Need one fewer card than normal to place Control markers (e.g., 3 cards to place 4th marker).  
- **Orcs**: Place one Control marker on your Orc Horde board (color-matched). At end of Age, optionally remove all markers to score Glory based on count (as shown on board).  
- **Skeletons**: Cannot be Leaders. Act as wild cards (can join any Band). At end of Age, remove all Skeletons before scoring Bands.  
- **Trolls**: Take one unclaimed Troll token with value ≤ Band size. Used to break ties for Kingdom control.  
- **Wingfolk**: Place Control marker in **any** Kingdom (must still meet size requirement).  
- **Wizards**: After discarding, draw X cards from the deck (X = Band size).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End of an Age  
Triggered when the **third Dragon card** is drawn.  

1. **Allies Scatter**: All players discard remaining cards in hand.  
2. **Glory for Kingdoms**: Score each Kingdom:  
   - **First Age**: Most Control markers → Glory = “I” token.  
   - **Second Age**:  
     - Most → “II” token  
     - Second most → “I” token  
   - **Third Age**:  
     - Most → “III” token  
     - Second most → “II” token  
     - Third most → “I” token  
   - **Ties**: Combine Glory values of tied positions, divide equally (round down).  
   - **2-player games (Second Age only)**:  
     - Second place earns **nothing**.  
     - If only one player has markers in a Kingdom, they earn **both** tokens.  
   - **3-player games**: Score normally in both Ages.  
3. **Glory for Bands**: Each Band scores based on size:  
   - 1 card: 0  
   - 2 cards: 1  
   - 3 cards: 3  
   - 4 cards: 6  
   - 5 cards: 10  
   - 6+ cards: 15  
   - **Dwarves**: Score as if Band had +1 card.  
   - **Skeletons**: Remove all Skeletons from Bands before scoring.  
4. **Tribe Bonuses**: Resolve Merfolk, Giants, Orcs, etc., if applicable.  

#### A New Age Dawns  
- Discard all Bands and cards.  
- Reshuffle all Ally cards + 3 Dragon cards (shuffle Dragons into bottom half).  
- Repeat Beginning a New Age.  
- **Control markers remain** on board (including Merfolk and Orc Horde boards).  
- **Troll and Giant tokens return** to the side.  

#### End of the Game  
- After **Third Age** (or **Second Age** in 2–3 player games), the game ends.  
- Player with **most Glory** wins.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Most Control markers on the board.  
  2. Largest Band played in the **last Age**.  
  3. Second-largest Band, etc.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a Band that doesn’t let me place a marker?** Yes. You may play any valid Band even if too small to place a marker.  
- **Can I use abilities of non-Leader cards?** No, except Skeletons (wild card function).  
- **Can I play a Band with only Skeletons?** Yes, but one must not be the Leader (Skeletons cannot lead).  
- **What happens to Orc Horde markers if not pillaged?** They stay for future Ages.  
- **Can Merfolk board be exceeded?** No. If a player reaches the last space, their marker stops.  
- **Can Giant token be moved mid-Age?** Yes. A player may take it with a larger Giant Band, even from their own previous Band.
