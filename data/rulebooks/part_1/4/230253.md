## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   This is a narrative-driven, branching solo/cooperative campaign for *Star Realms: Frontiers*, designed to be played by 1–3 players. The story follows a newly graduated commander (or an exiled vice admiral in an alternate version) thrust into a galactic crisis involving pirate attacks, inter-faction conflicts, and a rising cosmic threat known as the Nemesis or Dimensional Horror.  
   - **Primary Objective**: Survive a series of escalating battles, make story-altering decisions, uncover the truth behind coordinated attacks, and ultimately confront a universe-threatening entity.  
   - **Victory Conditions**: Complete the final battle against the ultimate enemy (e.g., Nemesis Beast or Dimensional Horror). Multiple endings exist based on player choices.  
   - **Lose Conditions**: Lose a required battle or fail to progress due to insufficient resources.

2. **Components**  
   - *Star Realms: Frontiers* base game (required)  
   - Solo/co-op challenge decks (included in Frontiers):  
     - Pirates of the Dark Star  
     - Madness of the Machine  
     - Defy the Empire  
     - Blob Assault  
     - The Cost of Freedom  
     - Automatons  
     - Nemesis  
     - Dimensional Horror  
   - Pencil and paper (to track Authority, bonuses, penalties, and progress)  
   - Optional: Extra cards or tokens to mark special starting ships or rewards

3. **Setup**  
   - Choose a difficulty level before the first battle:  
     - **Beginner**: 3 turns before boss activates  
     - **Intermediate**: 2 turns before boss  
     - **Veteran**: 1 turn before boss  
     - **Expert**: Boss goes first  
   - Initial Authority: 50 per player (unless otherwise modified)  
   - Starting Deck: Standard starting deck, modified by story events (e.g., replace one Scout with a Frontier Runner)  
   - Track all bonuses, penalties, and Authority changes on paper.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   - The game is structured as a branching narrative via "cards" (digital or printed).  
   - Each card presents:  
     - Story text  
     - A decision or battle  
     - A link to the next card based on outcome  
   - After each battle:  
     - Record remaining Authority  
     - Apply any rewards or penalties  
     - Proceed to next story node  
   - Between battles, players may visit a space station to perform actions (up to 2–4 actions depending on context).

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Battles**: Use standard *Star Realms: Frontiers* solo/co-op rules with modifications:  
     - Specific starting decks or Authority adjustments  
     - Extra starting cards or turns  
     - Removed or added cards in Trade Deck  
     - Special starting ships in hand (e.g., Frontier Runner)  
   - **Authority**: Not reset between battles; carry over unless restored via "authority restore" action  
   - **Space Station Actions** (available at certain points):  
     1. **Restore Authority**: Return to maximum (as defined by current battle rules)  
     2. **Go on a Mission**: Play a side challenge (e.g., Dimensional Horror, Pirates) for a random reward or penalty  
     3. **Gamble**: Draw from a 4-card deck (2 Vipers, 2 Explorers); draw Explorers for Trade bonuses, but drawing a Viper ends the game  
     4. **Duel a Commander**: Fight a simulated battle against a faction; win to gain a faction ship in starting hand, lose to lose a special ship or bonus  
   - **Rewards** (one-time or persistent):  
     - Increase Trade Row size to 6  
     - +4 Trade (one use), +2 Trade (second use)  
     - +8 Authority or -5 opponent Authority (one use)  
     - -6 opponent Authority (stealth weapon)  
     - Remove a penalty or +10 Authority (one battle)  
   - **Penalties**:  
     - Lose a reward  
     - Opponent starts with +3 Authority (permanent until removed)  
     - Choose: lose reward or +6 opponent Authority  
   - **Branching Consequences**:  
     - Fighting the Machine Cult or Star Empire removes specific cards from their decks in the final battle  
     - Losing battles may require removing special starting ships  
     - Previous choices affect ally strength in the final confrontation

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - The campaign ends with one of several conclusions based on decisions:  
     - Rebuild the Trade Federation station (neutral ending)  
     - Destroy the Blob base (aggressive ending)  
     - Overthrow the Trade Federation (rebellion ending)  
     - Join another faction (escape ending)  
     - Death (defeat endings)  
   - **Final Battle (Nemesis Beast)**:  
     - Setup: Standard rules, but add one extra card to boss for each player  
     - If previously defeated: get 3 actions to prepare  
     - If previously fought Machine Cult or Star Empire: remove specific cards from allied decks  
     - Victory leads to post-battle choices and multiple endings  
   - **Scoring (Alternate Campaign: "Mistakes Made")**:  
     - Start at 0 points  
     - +12 for victory in *The Last Stand*  
     - +6 for victory in *Federation's Fight*  
     - +1 for each other victory  
     - Final Rank:  
       - 0–11: Ultimately Futile  
       - 12–13: Accidental Hero  
       - 14–15: Good Soldier

       - 22: Grizzled War Hero  
       - 23: Legendary Commander

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Authority Carryover**: Always carry over unless explicitly restored or reduced  
   - **Special Starting Ships**: Only replace one standard starting card (e.g., Scout) unless otherwise stated  
   - **Mission Rewards**: Randomly assigned; track on paper  
   - **Gamble Mechanic**: High risk, high reward; ends game on Viper draw  
   - **Duel Rules**: No bonuses allowed; Authority is set by challenge; only one duel per faction, only if you don’t already have their ship  
   - **Multiple Playthroughs**: Choices create different paths; save progress using external tracking  
   - **Final Battle Prep**: Number of actions depends on prior wins/losses (2–4 actions)  
   - **Card Removal**: When told to remove cards from Trade Deck (e.g., Machine Cult or Star Empire), do so before final battle setup
