## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
"Cat in the Box" is a trick-taking card game inspired by quantum observation principles. Players act as researchers experimenting on cats whose fur color is indeterminate until observed. The objective is to score the most points across a series of rounds (equal to the number of players) by accurately predicting tricks won and forming connected groups of tokens on the research board.

2. Components  
- 45 Cat cards: Five cards each numbered 1 through 9  
- 5 Player boards  
- 1 Research board  
- 4 Research cards (inserted into research board)  
- 60 Player tokens: 12 each in red, blue, yellow, green, and purple  
- 1 Round Start Player card  
- 4 Observed tokens (black cat-head shaped, used in some player counts)  
- 1 Experiment result booklet (score sheet)  
- 1 Rulebook  

Note: Component usage varies by player count (see Table 1-1 and Table 2-1).

3. Setup  
1. Players sit so hands are hidden from each other.  
2. Each player takes one player board and 12 player tokens of a single color.  
3. Place one token on each × (four total) of your player board. These indicate playable colors.  
4. Insert research cards into the research board per player count:  
   - 2 players: Use white sides of 123 and 456 cards; fold board; cover unused 6s with observed tokens  
   - 3 players: Use white (beginner) or purple (advanced) sides of 123 and 456 cards; fold board  
   - 4 players: Use all cards (white or purple); cover unused 9s with observed tokens  
   - 5 players: Use all cards (white or purple); no covering needed  
5. (Optional) Record player names in the experiment result booklet.  
6. The player who most recently encountered a cat becomes the start player and takes the Round Start Player card.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has three phases:  
1. Preparation phase  
2. Trick phase  
3. Scoring phase  

The game consists of a number of rounds equal to the number of players.

5. Core Mechanics  

[1] Preparation Phase  
- Deal cards:  
  - 2–4 players: 10 cards each  
  - 5 players: 9 cards each  
- Each player selects one card from their hand and places it face down near the research board. This card is out of the round.  
- Victory prediction (bidding):  
  - 3 players: May bid 1, 3, or 4 tricks (not 2)  
  - 4 or 5 players: May bid 1, 2, or 3 tricks  
  - 2 players: No bidding  
  - Starting with the start player, each places a token on their predicted trick count.  

[2] Trick Phase  
- Start player leads the first trick.  
- On your turn:  
  1. Play one cat card from your hand.  
  2. Declare its observed color: red, blue, yellow, or green.  
  3. Place the card beside the declared color on your player board.  
  4. Place one of your tokens on the corresponding number-space of that color on the research board.  

Declaring Color – Rules:  
- Rule 1: The space on the research board for that color and number must be empty.  
- Rule 2: Your player board must still have a token on the × of the declared color.  

Start Player Restrictions:  
- May not declare red (trump) unless:  
  - At least one red token is already on the research board, OR  
  - They have no legal non-red play  
- May declare blue, yellow, or green freely if legal.  

Following Players:  
- May declare any color that satisfies Rule 1 and Rule 2.  
- If declaring a color different from the led color, remove your token from the × of the led color on your player board.  
- Once removed, that color cannot be declared for the rest of the round.  

Led Color:  
- The first declared color in a trick is the led color.  

Winner of the Trick:  
- If all cards match the led color: Highest number wins.  
- If red (trump) is played: All red cards beat non-red. Among red cards, highest number wins.  
- If non-red but non-led color is played: Only led-color cards remain; highest number wins.  
- The winner collects all trick cards into a face-down pile and leads the next trick.  
- The Round Start Player card does not move.

End of Trick Phase:  
- Ends when only one card remains in each player’s hand, OR  
- A paradox occurs.  

Paradox:  
- Occurs when a player cannot legally play any card (no color declaration satisfies rules).  
- Player reveals their hand and declares a paradox.  
- The trick is canceled (no winner).  
- Trick phase ends immediately.  
- Tokens placed during that trick remain on the research board.  
- Intentional paradoxes are not allowed; if a legal play exists, it must be made.

[3] Scoring Phase  
Scores from Tricks:  
- Each trick won = +1 point  
- If a player caused a paradox: –1 point per trick won  

Bonus Score from Victory Prediction:  
- If a player won exactly the number of tricks they predicted, they score a bonus.  
- Bonus = 1 point per token in their largest orthogonally adjacent group on the research board.  
- Diagonal connections do not count.  
- Players who caused a paradox do not receive a bonus.  

2-Player Special Rule:  
- No bidding.  
- After scoring tricks: If a player won 4 or fewer tricks, they score the bonus (as if prediction succeeded).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After scoring, prepare for next round:  
  - Collect all player tokens from research and player boards.  
  - Place one token back on each × of player board.  
  - Pass Round Start Player card to the left.  
  - Shuffle all used and discarded cat cards back into deck.  
- Game ends after each player has been start player once.  
- Total all round scores.  
- Winner: Highest total score.  
- Tiebreaker: Player with highest score in final round wins.  
- If still tied, players share victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I declare red as start player if red has been played earlier in the round?  
  A: Yes. Once any red token is on the research board, red may be led.  

- Q: What if I have no legal play but forget to declare a paradox?  
  A: Another player may point it out. You must then reveal your hand. If no legal play exists, paradox stands.  

- Q: Can I remove a color token voluntarily?  
  A: No. Tokens are only removed when not following suit.  

- Q: Do trick piles need to be kept separate?  
  A: Yes. To count tricks accurately, keep each trick in a distinct pile.  

- Q: In 2-player game, what happens to leftover cards?  
  A: After dealing 10 cards each, 5 remain. Reveal 3; place tokens on green row (yellow/blue if duplicates; all three colors if triple). These occupy spaces and affect play.  

- Q: Can a paradox occur mid-trick?  
  A: Yes. The trick is interrupted. Players who already played keep cards revealed. No one wins the trick.  

- Q: What if I mistakenly think I have a legal play but don’t?  
  A: If another player notices, you must attempt a legal play. If none exists, paradox occurs.
