## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Raiders of Scythia is a worker placement and dice-based raiding game set in the ancient steppes. Players take on the roles of Scythian warlords leading raids across Cimmeria, Assyria, Persia, and Greece to gain plunder, complete quests, and build powerful crews. The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VP) through completed quests, collected plunder, crew, animals, and other achievements.

The game ends when either only 2 raid spaces or 2 quests (faceup or facedown) remain on the board. After final turns, players tally their points to determine the winner.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Working (Scythian Village Buildings)  
Available actions depend on building and worker color. Blue workers cannot activate Stables or Chief’s Tent.  

| Building        | Actions |
|----------------|--------|
| **Stables**     | Spend 2 Silver → gain 1 Eagle, or 1 Equipment → gain 1 Horse. Choose from 3 faceup Animal Cards. Replace taken card immediately from deck. Shuffle discard if needed. |
| **Barracks**    | Hire 1 Crew from hand (pay printed Silver cost), or spend 1 Kumis to remove 2 Wounds from crew. Max 5 crew. Discard old crew to hire new. |
| **Silversmith** | Gain 3 Silver if placing/picking up Blue worker; gain 2 Silver if Grey/Red. Max 8 Silver at end of turn. |
| **Farm**        | Gain 2 Provisions if Blue/Grey worker placed/picked up; gain 3 Provisions or 1 Wagon if Red. Max 8 Provisions. |
| **Chief’s Tent**| Spend 1 Livestock → gain 2 Provisions + 1 Kumis, OR complete 1 faceup Quest (pay requirements). Quests placed facedown next to board. Max 8 Provisions/Kumis. |
| **Town Centre** | Choose one: Play 1 card from hand, use Hero ability, or use Eagle ability (from crew beneath eagle). |
| **Meeting Tent**| Draw 2 Crew Cards, or draw 1 and gain 2 Kumis. Max 8 cards in hand, 8 Kumis. |
| **Market**      | Discard 1 card → gain 2 Silver, or discard 2 cards → gain 1 Wagon or 1 Equipment. Max 8 Silver. |

#### Raiding  
To raid a settlement (Cimmeria, Assyria, Persia, Greece), you must:  
1. Have the required **Worker color** above the settlement.  
2. Have **crew size ≥ minimum** shown on raid space.  
3. Pay required **Provisions and Wagons**.  

**Steps to Raid:**  
1. Place your Worker on a Worker Spot at the settlement (remains there for game).  
2. Pay required Provisions and Wagons to supply.  
3. Optionally spend Kumis (1 per kumis = +1 Strength).  
4. Roll dice:  
   - Red & White Dice: number shown on left of board per civilization.  
   - Yellow Dice: 1 per raid space at settlement that has ≥1 Gold.  
5. Total Strength =  
   - Kumis spent  
   - Sum of all dice  
   - Crew & Animal Strength (top-left of cards)  
   - Crew abilities (if conditions met)  
6. Compare total Strength to raid space: gain VP or suffer Wounds (or both).  
7. Select 1 remaining raid space: take Plunder and new Worker above it.  
8. If a Quest was under Plunder, flip it faceup (remains on board).  

Turn ends after raid.

#### Animals  
- Eagles: placed above crew space (under board to hide horse side).  
- Horses: placed below crew space (hide eagle side).  
- Only animals equipped to a crew card can be used in raids.  
- Max 5 Eagles and 5 Horses.  
- When gaining new animal, may discard one from board to replace.  
- Cannot move animals between spaces.  

#### Wounds & Death  
- Wounds reduce crew Strength by 1 each.  
- Max wounds per crew = their base Strength.  
- If a crew at 0 Strength takes a final wound → **killed**.  
  - Return all wounds to supply.  
  - Place crew in discard pile.  
- Wounds cannot be transferred.  
- Healing:  
  - Barracks: spend 1 Kumis → remove 2 Wounds.  
  - Some Town Centre effects or Leader abilities.  

#### Leader Cards  
Each player may use one Leader ability once per game (assumed from context):  
- **Arpada**: Gain 1 Silver, 1 Kumis, 1 Provision, 1 Card  
- **Charope**: Take 2 Town Centre actions  
- **Enaree**: Discard 1 card → hire 1 crew for free  
- **Hurasu**: Complete a quest and gain 1 Kumis  
- **Katiari**: Remove up to 3 wounds or gain 3 Silver  
- **Patak**: Gain 1 Eagle  
- **Sparethra**: Spend 2 Silver → gain 1 Horse  
- **Vadasz**: Gain 4 Kumis, 1 Provision

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Trigger  
Game ends when **either**:  
- Only 2 raid spaces remain unclaimed, OR  
- Only 2 quests (faceup or facedown) remain on the board.  

When triggered:  
- Current player finishes their turn.  
- Each player (including current) takes **one final turn**.  
- Then proceed to final scoring.  

#### Final Scoring  
Players gain VP for:  
1. **Crew**: as shown in bottom-left of some Crew Cards.  
2. **Animals**: as shown on top of some Animal Cards.  
3. **Quests**: value printed on each completed Quest (facedown beside board).  
4. **Plunder**:  
   - Gold: 2 VP each  
   - Equipment: 1 VP each  
   - Wagon: 1 VP each  
   - Livestock: 1 VP per **pair**  

Add all VP to current track position.

#### Winning  
- Highest total VP wins.  
- Tiebreaker:  
  1. Most total Quests, Crew, and Animals.  
  2. Most Silver, Provisions, Kumis.  
  3. If still tied, **shared victory**.  

#### VP Track Mechanics  
- At 50 VP: stand marker on side, reset to 0, total = 50 + new position.  
- At 100 VP: loop again, total = 100 + new position.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use the same Hero or Eagle ability twice in a turn?**  
  No. Even with “take another Town Centre action,” you cannot reuse the same Hero or Eagle ability.  

- **Can I place animals on empty crew spaces?**  
  Yes. Animals do not need to be placed under existing crew, but only those paired with crew can be used in raids.  

- **Can I hire a crew member without a space?**  
  No. You may only hire if you have an available space (max 5). You may discard an existing crew to make room.  

- **Do I roll yellow dice for Greece?**  
  Yes. Roll 1 yellow die per raid space in Greece that has ≥1 Gold.  

- **Can I use a card ability that says “use any building’s action” to activate Stables or Chief’s Tent with a blue worker?**  
  No. The worker used to trigger the effect matters. A blue worker cannot activate Stables or Chief’s Tent.  

- **What does “if wounded” mean?**  
  Refers to receiving **1 or more wounds** in a raid. Not per wound.  

- **What does “if killed” mean?**  
  Crew member dies when it takes a wound while at 0 Strength. Cannot be wounded further.  

- **Can I discard a crew to make room during setup?**  
  Yes. During setup, after selecting starting crew, you may discard excess to meet 3-card hand limit.  

- **Can I complete a quest without a grey or red worker?**  
  Yes. The Chief’s Tent action to complete a quest does not require a grey/red worker — only the other action (livestock conversion) is always available.
