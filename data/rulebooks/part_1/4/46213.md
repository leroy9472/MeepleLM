## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Telestrations is a party drawing and guessing game inspired by the classic "telephone" game. Players pass sketchbooks around the group, alternating between drawing a word and guessing what a drawing represents. The chain of drawings and guesses often leads to hilarious misinterpretations.

**Objective**:  
- The primary goal is to have fun and laugh with friends and family.  
- If scoring is used, players aim to earn points based on accurate guesses or creative sketches.  
- The game ends after 3 rounds, and the player with the most points wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the card box, sand timer, clean-up cloths, and die in the center of the table.  
2. Each player selects:  
   - One sketchbook  
   - One dry-erase marker  
   - One word card  
3. Players write their name on the front page of their sketchbook and remember the color of their coil.  
4. The group decides whether to use the "This Side" or "That Side" of the cards (both are equal in difficulty).  
5. One player rolls the die to begin.  

**Getting a Secret Word**:  
- Each player finds the word on their card that matches the die roll (1–6).  
- If the space is blank, the player may choose any word.  
- If the word is underlined (e.g., "TV SHOW"), the player may choose any word within that category.  
- If the symbol "me" appears at the bottom of the card, the player may choose any word from the card.  
- Write the chosen word in the "Secret Word" section of the first page. Do not reveal it.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
**Determine Starting Action Based on Player Count**:  
- **Even number of players (4, 6, or 8)**:  
  - Each player turns to the "Sketch It" page in their own book and prepares to draw their secret word.  
- **Odd number of players (5 or 7)**:  
  - Each player turns to "Sketch It" page 1, then passes their book face-down to the player on their left.  
  - The receiving player looks at the secret word and will draw it.

**Turn Sequence (Alternating Sketch and Guess)**:  
1. **Sketching Turn**:  
   - If the last page has a word, flip the 60-second timer and draw that word on the next "Sketch It" page.  
   - No letters or numbers allowed.  
   - If time runs out, complete as much as possible, then pass the book face-down to the left.  
2. **Guessing Turn**:  
   - If the last page has a drawing, flip back to view it.  
   - Then go to the next "Guess It" page and write what you believe the drawing represents.  
   - No time limit, but keep it prompt.  
3. After completing your turn (draw or guess), turn to the next page to hide your work and pass the open book to the player on your left.

**Continuing the Round**:  
- The sketchbook continues around the circle.  
- Each player contributes one sketch or guess per book.  
- The round ends when all books have made a full rotation and return to their original owner.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Word Selection**: Based on die roll, card content, and player choice (blank/underlined/"me" symbol).  
- **Drawing Rules**:  
  - Only visual representation allowed.  
  - No letters, numbers, or symbols.  
  - Must attempt to complete the drawing even if time runs out.  
- **Guessing Rules**:  
  - Write the word(s) you believe the drawing depicts.  
  - Guesses can be phrases or multiple words if appropriate.  
- **Passing Direction**: Always to the left. Can be reversed in subsequent rounds.  
- **Book Tracking**: Use the colored coil to identify your own book when it returns.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End of Round**:  
- Once a player receives their own sketchbook back, they close it (name visible) and pass it to the player on their left.  
- When you receive a closed book, wait for the reveal phase.

**The Big Reveal**:  
- Players take turns presenting their sketchbook.  
- Start with the secret word, then flip through each pair of pages (drawing → guess) until the final guess.  
- Laugh, enjoy, and optionally score.

**Scoring Options (Choose One)**:  
- **Friendly Scoring**:  
  1. Give 1 point to the player who made your favorite **sketch** in your book.  
  2. Give 1 point to the player who made your favorite **guess** in your book.  
  3. Give yourself 1 point if the **final guess** matches your secret word.  
- **Competitive Scoring**:  
  1. **Guessers** earn 1 point if their guess matches the secret word or the previous guess.  
  2. **Sketchers** earn 1 point if their sketch leads to a correct guess (i.e., the next guess matches the intended word).  
  3. Give yourself 1 point if the **final guess** matches your secret word.

**Game Length**:  
- A full game consists of **3 rounds**.  
- After 3 rounds, total all points. The player with the most points wins.

  - No. Keep the word and drawings secret. Talking or giving hints is not allowed.  
- **What if I receive my own book before the round ends?**  
  - Continue playing as normal. You may still draw or guess based on the last page.  
- **Can I erase my work before passing?**  
  - No. Only erase after the full game or between rounds during cleanup.  
- **What if a marker dries out?**  
  - Replace it with any standard dry-erase marker.  
- **Can I use a word not on the card if the space isn’t blank or underlined?**
