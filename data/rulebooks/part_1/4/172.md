## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *For Sale*, players take on the role of real estate tycoons competing to become the richest mogul. The game unfolds in two phases: first, players bid on properties using limited funds; second, they sell those properties to earn currency cards. Victory is determined not by how much you spend, but by how much you make.

**Objective**: Acquire property cards during the buying phase and then sell them in the selling phase to maximize your total wealth. The player with the highest total value of currency cards and remaining coins wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most remaining coins wins.

   - **5–6 players**: Each player receives 10 × $1,000 coins + 2 × $2,000 coins = $14,000
4. **Remove cards based on player count**:
   - **3 players**: Randomly remove 6 Property cards and 6 Currency cards (do not look at them)
   - **4 players**: Randomly remove 2 Property cards and 2 Currency cards
   - **5–6 players**: No cards removed

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game is played in **two distinct phases**:

#### Phase 1: Buying Properties
Repeat the following steps until all Property cards are sold:

1. **Round Setup**:  
   Reveal a number of Property cards equal to the number of players from the top of the deck. Arrange them in ascending order by value (lowest to highest).

2. **Bidding Phase** (clockwise order):
   - The player who won the **highest-value property** in the previous round starts bidding.
   - On a player’s turn, they may:
     - **Bid**: Place any amount of coins (including $0) in front of them. Each new bid must be **higher** than the last.
     - **Pass**: Exit the auction.
       - Take the **lowest-value** property currently on the table.
       - Take back **half** of their last bid, **rounded up** (i.e., pay half, rounded down, to the bank).
       - Place the acquired property face down in front of them.
       - They are out of the round.
   - Play continues clockwise. Players who have passed may not re-enter.
   - Bidding continues until all but one player has passed.

3. **Round End**:
   - The last remaining player pays their **full bid** to the bank and takes the **highest-value** property on the table.
   - All other revealed properties are removed from the game (not taken by anyone).
   - The player who won the highest-value property in this round will start the bidding in the next round.

> **Note**: Players keep their remaining money hidden throughout the game.

#### Phase 2: Selling Properties
Once all Property cards are distributed, begin the selling phase. Repeat until all players have sold all their properties:

1. **Round Setup**:  
   Reveal a number of Currency cards equal to the number of players. Arrange them in ascending order (lowest to highest).

2. **Selling Phase**:
   - Each player selects **one** of their property cards **in secret** and places it face down.
   - All players reveal their cards simultaneously.
   - Rank the revealed property cards by number (highest = 30, lowest = 1).
   - Assign Currency cards from highest to lowest:
     - Highest property → Highest currency
     - Second highest → Second highest currency
     - And so on.
   - Players collect their assigned Currency card.
   - All property cards played this round are **discarded**.

> If there is a tie in property value, tiebreaker is determined by mutual agreement or random draw—no official rule specified.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Hidden Information**: Players keep their remaining coins and owned property cards hidden.
- **Ascending Auctions**: Bids must increase each time; players can pass at any time.
- **Passing Penalty/Incentive**: Passing gives you the weakest property but refunds half your bid (rounded up).
- **Turn Order**: Driven by performance—winner of highest property starts next buying round.
- **Simultaneous Selection**: In Phase 2, all players commit to a property before revealing, creating bluffing and strategic tension.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- The game ends when **all property cards have been sold** in Phase 2.
- Each player totals:
  - Value of all **Currency cards** collected
  - Value of all **remaining coins**
- The player with the **highest total** wins.
- **Tiebreaker**: Among tied players, the one with the **most remaining coins** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
**Q: What if a player bids $0 and then passes?**  
A: They take the lowest property and get back half of $0 (i.e., $0), so no money is lost.

**Q: Can you bid $0?**  
A: Yes. A $0 bid is valid. If you are the last bidder, you pay nothing and get the top property.

**Q: What happens to unclaimed property cards when someone passes?**  
A: Only the **lowest-value** property is taken by the passing player. All others (including the one they bid on) remain until the round ends.

**Q: What happens to unclaimed property cards after a round?**  
A: After the final bidder takes the highest property, **all other revealed properties are discarded** and not used again.

**Q: What if only one property is revealed in a round?**  
A: That only occurs if the number of remaining properties equals the number of players in the final round. Normal rules apply.

**Q: How are ties resolved in Phase 2?**  
A: The rules do not specify. Recommended: Use random draw or agreed-upon method. Highest currency goes to one tied player, next to the other, etc.

**Q: Do players keep their property cards until Phase 2?**  
A: Yes. All property cards won in Phase 1 are kept face down and used only in Phase 2.
