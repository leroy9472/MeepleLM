## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Love Letter*, players compete to deliver a love letter to the Princess by influencing who among the royal court is closest to her favor. Each player represents a suitor using intermediaries—court members encoded in cards—to advance their message. The goal is to win rounds by having the most influence at the critical moment, earning tokens of affection. The first player to earn enough tokens wins the Princess’s heart and the game.

### 2. Components  
- 16 cards representing members of the royal court:  
  - Guard (5 copies)  
  - Priest (2 copies)  
  - Baron (2 copies)  
  - Handmaid (2 copies)  
  - Prince (2 copies)  
  - King (1 copy)  
  - Countess (1 copy)  
  - Princess (1 copy)  
- 8 reference tokens (optional, for tracking round wins)  
- 1 draw deck (formed from shuffled cards)  

Note: Thematic rethemed versions (e.g., Power Rangers, MAFS, Rudolph) use equivalent mechanics with renamed characters and win conditions (e.g., Power Gems, STAY cards).

### 3. Setup  
1. Shuffle all 16 cards to form a face-down draw deck.  
2. Remove the top card of the deck and set it aside face down (out of play for the round).  
3. For 2-player games only: Reveal 3 additional cards from the top of the deck and place them face up beside the play area. These are out of play but visible to all.  
4. Each player draws 1 card from the deck. This is their hand and must remain secret.  
5. Determine the starting player:  
   - First round: The player who was most recently on a date, or if tied, the youngest player.  
   - Subsequent rounds: The winner of the previous round. In case of a tie, the most recently powerful (or youngest) among tied winners starts.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Draw**: On your turn, draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand. You now have two cards.  
2. **Discard & Apply Effect**: Choose one card from your hand to discard face up in front of you. Immediately resolve its effect, even if detrimental.  
3. **Discard Pile**: Discarded cards remain in front of each player, overlapping to show order.  
4. **Turn Order**: After resolving the effect, pass the turn to the player on your left.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Effects (by rank)**:  
  - **Princess (8)**: If discarded, you are out of the round.  
  - **Countess (7)**: If in hand with King or Prince, you must discard the Countess. No effect when discarded.  
  - **King (6)**: Trade hands with another active player of your choice.  
  - **Prince (5)**: Choose any player (including yourself). That player discards their hand and draws a new card. If the deck is empty, they draw the removed card.  
  - **Handmaid (4)**: Until your next turn, you are immune to the effects of other players’ cards.  
  - **Baron (3)**: Choose another active player. Secretly compare hands. The player with the lower value is out of the round. Tie: no effect.  
  - **Priest (2)**: Look at another active player’s hand.  
  - **Guard (1)**: Name a non-Guard card (e.g., “King”). Choose another player. If they have that card, they are out of the round.  

- **Out of the Round**:  
  - If knocked out, discard your hand face up (do not apply effect).  
  - Take no further turns until the next round.  
  - Cannot be targeted by effects unless specified (e.g., Prince can still force discard).  

- **Targeting Restrictions**:  
  - If a player is protected (e.g., by Handmaid), and your card requires choosing them, the effect fails and is discarded with no result.  

- **Honesty**:  
  - Players must truthfully reveal cards when required (e.g., Baron comparison, Priest peek). Cheating is discouraged.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End of Round Triggers**:  
  1. The draw deck is empty at the end of a turn.  
  2. All but one player are out of the round.  

- **Determine Winner**:  
  - If deck is empty: All remaining players reveal their hand. Highest card rank wins.  
  - Tie: Compare total value of discarded cards. Highest total wins.  
  - If still tied: All tied players win the round.  
  - If only one player remains: That player wins.  

- **Scoring**:  
  - Each round winner receives 1 token (Token of Affection, Power Gem Shard, or STAY card).  
  - Game ends when a player reaches:  
    - 2 players: 7 tokens  
    - 3 players: 5 tokens  
    - 4 players: 4 tokens  

- **New Round**:  
  - Reshuffle all 16 cards (including discarded and removed cards).  
  - Repeat setup.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I discard a card that has no valid target?**  
  Yes, but the effect fails (e.g., Priest when all others are out, Guard when only Guards remain).  

- **What if the Prince forces a player to draw, but the deck is empty?**  
  That player draws the card that was initially removed from the game.  

- **Can I use the King to trade with a player protected by Handmaid?**  
  Yes. Handmaid only protects against *targeted effects*, not voluntary exchanges.  

- **Must I discard the Countess if I have King or Prince?**  
  Yes, if both are in hand at the same time, the Countess must be discarded (when possible).  

- **Can I name “Guard” with the Guard card?**  
  No. You must name a non-Guard card.
