   - 1 Forest on the bottom double space.
5. Determine first player. Give them the Round 1 First Player Tile and the Wooden Ship. Distribute remaining tiles based on adjacency.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 7 rounds. Each round has 3 phases:

**I. Fishing Phase (Simultaneous)**
- Each player takes Fish equal to their Haul Size (leftmost visible number on Fishing Track).
- Distribute Fish in this order:
  1. **Elders:** 1 Fish per Elder in your Council. If an Elder reaches 3 Fish, immediately move 1 to your Personal Supply and return 2 to General Supply.
  2. **Foreign Shares:** 1 Fish per Share of your color on the Action Board, then in other players’ Personal Supplies.
  3. **Personal Shares:** 1 Fish per Issued Share in your Personal Supply.
  4. **Reserve:** Remaining Fish go to your Harbour Board’s Reserve (max 8). Excess beyond 8 return to General Supply.
- After distribution:
  - Move Fish from Shares in your Personal Supply to your Personal Supply.
  - Return Fish from Shares on Action Board to General Supply.

**II. Work Phase (Turn-based, Clockwise)**
- Starting with First Player, each player takes 3 turns (1 Worker placement per turn).
- Place 1 Worker on an available Action Space or Elder.
- Action Spaces have capacity (1, 2, or 3 Workers) — once full, they are blocked.
- You must perform the action immediately.
- You cannot take an action that does not change your player state.
- You may pass (forfeit a Worker), but still get future turns.
- **Elder Actions:** You may place a Worker directly on your Elder to activate it.

**III. Return Home Phase (Simultaneous)**
- All players retrieve their Workers.
- Move First Player Ship counter-clockwise to the next Round Space.
- Execute special round triggers:
  - **Round 3 (3–5P):** Add A Buildings equal to player count to Building Board.
  - **Round 4:** Each player draws:
    - 2P: 4 C Buildings
    - 3P: 3 C Buildings
    - 4–5P: 2 C Buildings (face-down, into hand)
  - **Round 5 (3–5P):** Add B Buildings:
    - 3–4P: 2
    - 5P: 3
  - **Round 6:** Each player places all unbuilt C Buildings from hand face-up next to Building Board (any player may now build them).

### 5. Core Mechanics
