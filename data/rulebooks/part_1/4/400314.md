## APIARY: STINGVASION — COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE MANUAL

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Apiary: Stingvasion*, the Mellifera (bees) expand into space and encounter new sentient species: the technologically advanced Vespidae (wasps), parasitic Chrysididae (cuckoo wasps), and the terrifying Soror (gargantuan reavers). While pursuing standard hive goals—spreading across the galaxy and developing your workforce—players must navigate alliances, threats, and cooperation.

**Goal**: Earn the most points by building your hive, managing new threats, and optionally uniting against the Soror. The core *Apiary* victory conditions remain unchanged, but new mechanics influence strategy and scoring.

---

### 2. Components  
- **9 Vespa Tiles** – Special tiles with unique abilities, placed above Farms.
- **10 Chrysididae Cuckoos** – Hidden tokens used to determine if a new worker is a normal bee or a parasitic cuckoo.
- **12 Chrysididae Cuckoo Tokens**:
  - 4 blank (normal worker)
  - 8 with larvae (cuckoo trigger)
- **3 Soror Tokens** – Represent victims during a Soror attack.
- **1 Soror Target Board** – Tracks players targeted during a Soror raid.

---

### 3. Setup  
**Add to standard Apiary setup**:
1. Place the **Soror Target Board** beside the main board.
2. Place **3 Soror Tokens** nearby.
3. Set aside the **10 Chrysididae Cuckoo tokens** as a supply.
4. Separate the **4 blank tokens** from the 8 larvae tokens.
5. Distribute 3 tokens per player:
   - **2–4 players**: Each player gets 1 blank + 2 larvae tokens (randomly assigned, do not look).
   - **5 players**: First player gets 1 larvae token, last player gets 1 blank token. Shuffle remaining 8 tokens and distribute 2 each so all have 3.
6. Shuffle and place **9 Vespa Tiles** in a face-up row above the Farms row.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Stingvasion integrates into standard *Apiary* turns. Key triggers:
- **GROW action** → Possible Cuckoo worker.
- **Explore reveals a resource planet** → Triggers **Soror attack**.
- **Vespa Tile abilities** activate during relevant actions.
- **Soror attack resolution** interrupts normal flow.

Players still take standard actions (Explore, Grow, Convert, Research, Advance, Carve), but now must account for:
- Hidden Cuckoo tokens.
- Vespa Tile costs and effects.
- Soror attack risk during Explore.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Vespa Tiles  
- Placed like Recruit/Development/Carve tiles but occupy space above Farms.
- Follow **Advance rules** for placement.
- **No inherent victory points**.
- Each has a **Build Cost** (paid when placed) and a **triggered ability**.
- Tiles with **▷ + bolded action** trigger when that action is taken (like standard tiles).
- If multiple effects trigger, choose order (pay costs as normal).

**Tile Effects**:
- **House-Warmer**: When you **Carve**, convert one ▢ to ▣.
- **Far Scout**: Reuse benefits of two ★. Return them to unexplored planets (discard if all explored).
- **Mentor**: When you **Grow** and gain a strength-1 worker, increase to strength-2 **if** you have a strength-3 or -4 worker in your Active Pool.
- **Wing Spanner**: Once per turn, after bumping your own worker back to Active Pool, pay ▢ to play a second worker.
- **Scythe Sharpeners**: When Soror attacks, pay ▢ to cover one spot on Soror Target Board. That spot is immune. Discard token after.
- **Tapestry Landmark**: Must be built at edge with **two empty sides**. Gain 1 ▣ once per turn when you **Grow**.
- **Vintner**: Once per turn, convert ▢ to ▣.
- **Charter Hive**: When built, return one built tile to Carve area. Immediately build one free tile (Recruit or Development). Must be placed where the returned tile was. Gain bonuses only from newly covered hexes.
- **Pendulum Station**: When you **Research**, pay ▢ to draw one extra card. Pay ▢ to plant one immediately (if legal).

---

#### Chrysididae Cuckoos  
Trigger: **Each time you take the GROW action** (or gain a free strength-1 worker via tile), you may receive a Cuckoo.

**Process**:
1. Choose and reveal one of your 3 hidden Cuckoo tokens.
2. **Blank token** → gain normal strength-1 worker. Return token to supply.
3. **Larvae token** → choose:
   - **Pay ▢** → discard token, gain normal strength-1 worker.
   - **Do not pay** → token stays revealed, place a **Cuckoo worker** (strength-1) in your Active Pool.

**Cuckoo Rules**:
- Always **strength-1**, never grows.
- **Hungry**: Must pay ▢ **whenever used in an action** (before or after, same turn).
- **Useful**:
  - Counts as **fifth worker** → enables full Farm income.
  - Counts as **active worker** for tile effects and endgame scoring.
  - Each Cuckoo **±2** to your effective rating during **Soror attack comparisons**.

**Removing Cuckoos**:
- When a **strength-4 worker hibernates**, it may **"drag" one Cuckoo** with it.
- Discard the Cuckoo.
- Gain a bonus **as if placing a second worker in Hibernation Comb** (e.g., extra ▣ or tile, depending on sector).

#### Soror Raiders  
**Trigger**: Whenever **Explore reveals a planet with a printed resource**, a **Soror attack occurs**.

**Attack Sequence**:
1. Starting with player to the **left of the one who triggered** the attack, each player takes a turn:
   - **a) Protect**: Pay ▢ to **cover one target spot** on Soror Target Board. Covered spots are immune.
   - **b) Sacrifice**: Place a **Soror Token** on an uncovered spot → that player is a **target**.
   - Spots are resolved **left to right**.
   - **Scythe Sharpeners** tile allows covering **up to two spots** in one turn.

2. Attack **commences** when:
   - All 3 Soror Tokens are placed, **or**
   - All 3 spots are covered.

**Attack Resolution**:
- Each **targeted player** loses their **lowest-strength bee**.
- Tie for lowest strength:
  1. Bee on **action space**
  2. Bee in **Landing Bay**
  3. Bee in **Active Pool**
- For each bee eaten, the player gains **1 Queen’s Favor (▢)** as consolation.

**Uniting Against Soror**:
- If **all 3 spots on Soror Target Board are covered** (no Sacrifices), the hive unites.
- **All players gain 1 ▢** (regardless of contribution).
- **Each player may choose**:
  - **Obey**: Gain nothing extra.
  - **Disobey**: Gain **1 additional ▢**, but the Queen remembers — gain **1 ▢** (Queen’s Favor) as penalty.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Standard *Apiary* endgame and scoring apply.
- **Cuckoos** count toward:
  - Worker count for **Farm income**.
  - Tile effects requiring active workers.
  - Endgame scoring (e.g., tiles that score per worker).
- **Soror interactions** affect scoring indirectly via:
  - Loss of workers (reduces action capacity).
  - Gaining Queen’s Favor (used in some tile abilities and endgame).
- **Uniting** grants immediate ▢, but disobedience adds to Queen’s Favor.

### 7. FAQ / Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I use a Cuckoo to trigger tile abilities?**  
A: Yes, as long as the tile requires an active worker. But you must pay ▢ to use it in an action.

**Q: Can I have more than one Cuckoo?**  
A: Yes. You may have multiple Cuckoos active. Each gives ±2 during Soror attacks.

**Q: What happens if I run out of Cuckoo tokens?**  
A: Once all 3 tokens are revealed, no more Cuckoos can be born. Remaining GROW actions yield normal workers.

**Q: Can I use Wing Spanner after bumping a Cuckoo?**  
A: Yes. Pay ▢ to play a second worker, even if the bumped worker is a Cuckoo.

**Q: Does Mentor work if I have a Cuckoo and a strength-3 worker?**  
A: Yes. Cuckoos are workers. As long as you have **any** strength-3 or -4 worker, Mentor applies.

**Q: Can I protect a spot after someone sacrifices?**  
A: No. Players resolve in order, left to right. Once a spot is sacrificed, it cannot be protected.

**Q: Does uniting require all players to contribute?**  
A: No. As long as all 3 spots are covered (by any combination of players), the hive unites.
