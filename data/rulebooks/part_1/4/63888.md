### 1. Lore & Objective
Innovation is a civilization-building game where players progress through ten ages of history, from the Stone Age to the Information Age, by discovering and utilizing technological advancements, ideas, and ingenuity. Players compete to win either by being the first to claim a required number of achievements based on player count, or by having the highest score when the game ends due to drawing a card beyond age 10.

The primary ways to win are:
- Claiming the required number of achievements:
  - 2 players or 4-player teams: 6 achievements
  - 3 players: 5 achievements
  - 4 players: 4 achievements
- Having the highest score when a card higher than age 10 must be drawn (immediate game end).

Some cards can also trigger immediate end-game conditions based on specific criteria (e.g., lightbulb icons, leaf icons, or score).

### 2. Components
- 105 unique innovation cards spanning 10 ages (1-10)
- 9 normal achievement cards (one randomly selected from each age 1-9)
- 5 special achievement cards: Monument, Empire, World, Wonder, Universe
- Reference cards for players
- Supply piles arranged in a clock formation

### 3. Setup
1. **Sort Cards**: Divide the 105 cards into 10 supply piles by age (1-10), arranged in a clock formation.
2. **Set Achievements**: Randomly remove one card from each age 1-9 pile (without looking) and place them face down in the center as normal achievements. Place the five special achievements nearby.
3. **Deal Starting Cards**: Each player draws two age 1 cards.
4. **Start Game**: Simultaneously, each player chooses one card to play face-up on their board; the other card becomes their starting hand.
5. **Determine First Player**: The player with the alphabetically first card name goes first. In a 4-player game, the first two players each take only one action on their first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On each turn, a player takes exactly two actions in any order and combination. The four available actions are:
- **Draw**: Draw a card from the supply pile matching the highest top card on your board. If that pile is empty, draw from the next higher non-empty pile. Drawing a card beyond age 10 ends the game.
- **Meld**: Play a card from your hand onto your board, placing it on top of its color pile (if any). If the pile is splayed, continue the splay.
- **Dogma**: Activate a top card on your board for its effect(s). All effects on the card are resolved in order. Non-demand effects may be shared with opponents who have at least as many of the featured icon. Demand effects (beginning with "I demand") target opponents with fewer of the featured icon.
- **Achieve**: Claim a normal achievement if you meet both conditions: (1) your score is at least 5 times the achievement’s age, and (2) you have a top card of equal or higher age. Special achievements are claimed immediately when their conditions are met.

After a Dogma action, if an opponent shared a non-demand effect and changed the game state (e.g., drew, scored, or moved cards), you gain a free Draw action.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Board**: Each player has a board with up to five color piles (blue, green, red, purple, yellow). Only the top card of each pile is active and visible.
- **Splaying**: Cards can be splayed left, right, or up, revealing additional icons from covered cards:
  - Splayed left: reveals 1 icon per card
  - Splayed right: reveals 2 icons per card
  - Splayed up: reveals 3 icons per card
  - To splay a new direction, first unsplay the pile.
- **Icons**: Six types: Castle, Crown, Leaf, Lightbulb, Factory, Clock. The featured icon of a Dogma action determines which players can share or are vulnerable to demands.
- **Sharing**: For non-demand Dogma effects, opponents with at least as many of the featured icon as you must also perform the effect. Sharing triggers a free Draw if it changes the game state.
- **Demand Effects**: Begin with "I demand" and are executed clockwise. Opponents with at least as many of the featured icon are immune.
- **Keywords**:
  - **Draw and X**: Draw a card and immediately perform an action with it (meld, score, tuck).
  - **Exchange**: Swap cards between two locations (can be unequal).
  - **Return**: Place a card face-down at the bottom of its supply pile.
  - **Score**: Place a card face-down in your score pile (worth its age in points).
  - **Tuck**: Place a card under its color pile, continuing any splay.
  - **Remove**: Completely take a card out of the game (e.g., Fission).
- **Golden Rule**: "Do all you can, ignore the rest." If you cannot complete part of an effect, do as much as possible.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Scoring**: Each card in your score pile is worth its age value. Total score determines eligibility for achievements and end-game victory.
- **Achievements**:
  - **Normal**: Claimed via Achieve action when score ≥ 5×age and you have a top card ≥ achievement age. Not replenished.
  - **Special**: Claimed immediately when conditions are met:
    - **Monument**: Tuck or score 6 cards in one turn (also via Masonry).
    - **Empire**: Have 3 of each of the 6 icons visible.
    - **World**: Have 12 Clock icons visible.
    - **Wonder**: Have 5 colors splayed right or up.
    - **Universe**: Have 5 top cards aged 8 or higher.
- **End Game Triggers**:
  1. A player claims the required number of achievements → that player wins.
  2. A player must draw a card beyond age 10 → game ends; highest score wins. Tiebreaker: most achievements, then draw.
  3. A Dogma effect triggers an immediate win condition (e.g., Empiricism, Collaboration, A.I.) → game ends if condition is uniquely satisfied.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hand Limit**: None.
- **Card Visibility**: You may examine your own board (including covered cards) and score pile. Opponents’ covered cards and pile sizes are hidden unless splayed.
- **Simultaneous Special Achievement Claims**: Resolved in clockwise turn order, starting with the current player.
- **Using Dogma on Inactive Cards**: You may activate a card even if no effect occurs.
- **Exchanges**: Do not count toward Monument achievement.
- **Splaying Piles of 0 or 1 Card**: Not possible; such piles are always unsplayed.
- **Team Play (4 players)**:
  - Demand effects do not affect teammates.
  - Sharing with only your teammate does not grant a free Draw.
  - "Opponent" effects do not affect teammates.
  - Team wins with 6 combined achievements or highest combined score if game ends by drawing beyond age 10.
