## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Foundations of Rome is a strategic city-building game where players develop their districts across three eras by acquiring deeds, constructing buildings, and managing resources. Players earn Victory Points (VP) through population growth, civic and commercial development, and monument construction. The goal is to have the highest VP at the end of Era 3. In the Will of the Consul cooperative module, the Consul (controlled by players in rotation) competes against them, winning if its VP exceeds all human players.

### 3. Setup  
**Base Game Setup (2–5 players):**  
1. Place the city grid board (small for 2–3 players, large for 4–5). For 2 and 4 players, ignore the bottom row and rightmost column.  
2. Place the Deeds for Sale board above the city board and the VP/Population tracker beside it.  
3. Each player chooses a color, takes a player tray, and places their VP and population markers at 5 VP and 0 population.  
4. Assign first player (owner's choice); give them the first player marker.  
5. Distribute coins:  
   - 1st player: 5 coins  
   - 2nd: 6 coins  
   - 3rd: 7 coins  
   - 4th: 8 coins  
   - 5th: 9 coins  
6. Remove Deed cards based on player count:

   - 3 players: Remove I, J, 9, 10  
   - 4 players: Remove J, 10  
   - 5 players: Use all cards  
7. Shuffle remaining Deed cards and deal 6 to each player.  
8. Players place lot markers on the city grid for each of their 6 deeds. Keep 2 markers in reserve.  
9. Set aside remaining Deed cards, split into 3 roughly equal piles, and place one pile on each Era space.

**Optional Expansions Setup:**

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds in three Eras.  
- In each Era, players take turns clockwise, performing one action per turn.  
- After all Deed cards in the Deeds for Sale board are taken, all players (including Consul if applicable) take one final turn.  
- Then, Era Scoring occurs.  
- Refill Deeds for Sale with 6 cards from next Era.  
- Pass first player marker to the left of the last player who acted.  
- In Will of the Consul, the Consul card passes to the next player (retaining its current side).  

**Player Actions (choose one per turn):**  
1. **Take Income:**  
   - Gain 5 coins + coins shown on your commercial buildings.  
   - Do not gain VP from commerce buildings now (only at Era scoring).  

2. **Buy a Deed:**  
   - Pay the cost shown above the Deed card.  
   - Minimum Deed cost increases by 1 for every 2 coins on Consul’s buildings (rounded down).  
   - Place excess cost coins on Deeds for Sale board.  
   - Take the leftmost Deed card, slide others left, draw new card to right.  
   - Place your lot marker on the grid.  
   - If out of markers, cannot buy.  
   - If no more Deed cards after purchase, trigger end of Era.  

3. **Construct a Building:**  
   - Place a building from your tray onto a lot(s) you own.  
   - Must cover only lots you own.  
   - May upgrade an existing building:  
     - Replace one or more smaller buildings with a larger one.  
     - Return old buildings to your tray.  
     - If new building doesn’t cover all previous lots, place lot markers on uncovered lots (if available).  
   - If building is residential (person icon), advance population marker accordingly.  
   - Monuments:  
     - Must meet requirements (if any).  
     - Can upgrade monuments to larger buildings.  
     - Upgraded monuments return to their card for reuse.  

**Consul Turn (Will of the Consul only):**  
- After the player who controls it takes their turn.  
- If no Deed cards left, skip Consul turn.  
- If Consul card is PLANNING: flip to READY (no action).  
- If Consul card is READY:  
  - Take leftmost Deed card (slide and refill).  
  - Place largest possible building token on that lot (larger if adjacent).  
  - Adjust population/coins if applicable.  
  - Return smaller buildings to discard pile for that size.  
  - If no building tokens available (and none in discard), Consul gains 7 VP instead.  
  - After placement, fill any empty Consul lots with largest possible tokens.  
  - Discard the Deed card.  
  - Flip Consul card to PLANNING.  
- Consul does nothing during final free turns.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Deed Market:** 6 face-up Deeds; buying shifts left, refill from top of Era deck.  
- **Building Construction:** Free to build; upgrades return old buildings.  
- **Population:** Tracked on shared track; only players with ≥1 population score.  
- **Commerce Buildings (olive, coin icon):** Award VP and coins at scoring (except Era 3: coins convert to VP).  
- **Civic Buildings (gray):** Score VP based on adjacent features (coins, people, buildings) — per the slash notation on tile:  
  - "2 VP per coin on adjacent buildings" → total coins × 2 VP  
  - "1 VP per 2 people" → floor(total people / 2)  
  - "1 VP per building" → count adjacent buildings (any player)  
  - "3 VP per civic building" → count adjacent civic buildings × 3  
- **Monuments:** Special buildings with unique effects; placed like buildings; requirements may apply.  
- **Roads of Fortune:**  
  - At start of Era scoring, calculate Influence per edge (sum of building sizes touching edge).  
  - Break ties: lowest letter, then lowest number.  
  - 1+ Influence required to gain benefits, not to suffer penalties.  
  - Place Milestone markers; return Lot markers if used.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Era Scoring (after all players take final turn):**  
1. **Population (beige residential):**  
   - Highest population: gains population value + bonus VP (Era 1: +4, Era 2: +7, Era 3: +10).  
   - Ties: all tied players receive full score.  
   - Others: gain VP equal to the population of the player just ahead on the track.  
   - Must have ≥1 population to score.  

2. **Civic Buildings:**  
   - Score per tile instructions using adjacent buildings (any player, including Consul).  

3. **Commerce Buildings:**  
   - Gain VP and coins as shown.  
   - In Era 3: only gain VP (coins listed are converted to VP).  

4. **Roads of Fortune (before other scoring):**  
   - Resolve each of the 4 road boards.  
   - Award benefits/penalties based on Influence.  

**End Game Scoring (End of Era 3):**  
- Score as in regular Era 3, with two additions:  
  1. Gain VP for coins that would have been awarded from commerce buildings (i.e., get VP for both VP and coin values).  
  2. Gain 1 VP for each lot you own that has no building.  
- Excess coins do not score VP (only used as tiebreaker).  

**Winning:**  
- Highest VP wins.  
- Tie: most coins wins.  

**Will of the Consul Win Condition:**  
- Consul wins if its VP is higher than every human player.
