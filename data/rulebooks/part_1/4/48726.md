  - 2 ships at Orbital Market
  - 3 ships at Colony Constructor
  - 4 ships at Shipyard
- These blocking ships remain with value '1' throughout the game.

4. Dummy Player D

## 4. Gameplay Flow
### Normal Turn Sequence
1. **Gather and Roll**: Collect all personal ships from board and roll.
2. **Assign Fleet**: Dock ships to orbital facilities meeting requirements.
3. **Use Alien Tech Cards**: Use any time during turn; pay fuel or discard.
4. **Place Colonies**: Immediately gain VP when placing; check territory control.
5. **Resource Cap**: Discard down to 8 total resources if over limit.
6. **End Turn**: Ships remain docked until next turn.

### Dummy Player Turns
When it's a dummy player's turn:
1. Roll 3d10s.
2. **Colony Placement**: If any two dice show equal value AND not all 7 colonies placed, place one colony on territory corresponding to third die's value (1-8 only).
   - If territory has Repulsor Field, re-roll until valid territory.
3. **Orbital Placement**: For each d10 (lowest to highest):
   - Value 1, 3, 5, or 9: Place 1 dummy die at corresponding facility if space available.
   - Value 2 or 8: Place 2 dummy dice at corresponding facility if pair of spaces available.
   - Value 4 or 6: Place 3 dummy dice at corresponding facility if set of three spaces available.
   - Value 10 with Factions: Place 1 die on Human Player A's faction board (C) or B's (D); pay 1 fuel to that player.
   - Value 10 without Factions: Ignore.
   - If no space available: Ignore that die result.
4. Stop if run out of dummy dice.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Orbital Facilities
- **Alien Artifact**: Dock ships of any value. Each ship allows cycling of 3 displayed cards. Total 8+ pips to claim a card.
- **Colonist Hub**: Advance colony one space per ship docked. Pay 1 fuel + 1 ore to launch from 7th space.
- **Colony Constructor**: Dock 3 ships of equal value + pay 3 ore to place colony.
- **Lunar Mine**: Each new ship ≥ highest existing. Gain 1 ore per ship.
- **Maintenance Bay**: Place undockable ships. No benefit. Ships cannot be moved.
- **Orbital Market**: Dock pair of equal value. Pay fuel = die value to receive 1 ore. Trade multiple times.
- **Raiders' Outpost**: Dock 3 sequential ships. Steal 4 resources or 1 Alien Tech card from opponents.
- **Shipyard**: Dock pair of equal value. Pay increasing fuel/ore to gain new ship (4th: 1/1, 5th: 2/2, 6th: 3/3).
- **Solar Converter**: Dock ships of any value. Gain fuel = ⌈value/2⌉ per ship.
- **Terraforming Station**: Dock 6 + pay 1 fuel + 1 ore to place colony. Ship returns to stock next turn.

### Territory Bonuses
- **Asimov Crater**: Advance +1 extra in Colonist Hub when docking >1 ship.

- **Positron Field**: Awards +1 VP to controller of territory. Placed/moved by discarding Data Crystal.
- **Repulsor Field**: Prevents adding/removing colonies. Placed/moved by discarding Gravity Manipulator.

### Dummy Player Rules
- Dummy player dice are treated as "docking cover" with no individual values.
- Cannot use resources, Alien Tech cards, or Agenda cards.
- Human players can move dummy dice via certain abilities (e.g., Plasma Cannon) but not those requiring value comparison.
- Dummy colonies follow normal majority rules and can be moved by appropriate cards.
- Ignore dummy dice on Lunar Mine for placement rules.
- Do not allow playing die at Alien Artifact to cycle deck for dummy players.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### Scoring
Players score VPs for:
- 1 VP per colony on territory
- 1 VP per territory controlled (majority colonies)
- 1 VP for possessing Alien City card
- 1 VP for possessing Alien Monument card
- 1 VP for controlling territory with Positron Field

### Game End
Game ends immediately when any player places their final colony.

### Winner Determination
- Only human players' scores are compared.
- Dummy player scores are ignored.
- Highest VP wins.
- Tiebreakers: Most Alien Tech cards → Most ore → Most fuel → Replay.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Dummy Player Colony Placement**: Only if two d10s match AND third die is 1-8 AND not all colonies placed.
- **Dummy Dice Movement**: Can be moved by abilities that don't reference die values (e.g., Plasma Cannon, Astrogation Servo discard ability).
- **Dummy Dice on Lunar Mine**: Ignore for determining valid placements; only human dice matter.
- **Factions Expansion**: Only human players may use faction boards; dummy players never place dice there.
- **Outer Belt Expansion**: Only human players may use; dummy players never place dice there.
- **Alien Artifact Cycling**: For dummy players, do not allow playing die to cycle deck; only allow claiming cards with 8+ total.
- **Resource Cap**: Apply after all actions; discard excess to supply.
- **Field Generators**: Take precedence over conflicting card effects.
