## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Skull King: Legendary Expansion enhances the core game of Skull King with new cards, abilities, and flexible gameplay options. Players compete over multiple rounds to accurately bid on and win the exact number of tricks per round. Victory comes from strategic play, precise prediction, and leveraging powerful special cards and abilities. The player with the highest score after all rounds wins.

2. Components  
- 5 Pirate cards (including Skull King and Tigress)  
- 5 Escape cards  
- 4 numbered suits (green, yellow, purple, black Jolly Roger), each ranked 1–14  
- 21 Bid cards  
- 6 Reference cards  
- Expansion cards (compass rose symbol):  
  - 2 Mermaid cards (Sirena, Alyra)  
  - 2 Loot cards  
  - 1 Kraken card  
  - 3 Replacement cards (utility only)  

3. Setup  
- Use the base Skull King deck. Add expansion cards only if selected.  
- Choose game format: standard 10 rounds or alternate round structure (e.g., Even Keeled, Whirlpool, etc.).  
- Record number of cards per round on score sheet ovals.  
- Shuffle deck. Deal cards starting with 1 per player in Round 1, increasing by 1 each round.  
- Each player receives a reference card and bid cards.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Deal cards for the round.  
2. Bidding: All players simultaneously reveal bids by showing fingers (1–5) or calling higher numbers.  
3. Scorekeeper records bids; players place bid cards face down.  
4. First trick led by player to dealer’s left.  
5. Play proceeds clockwise. Each trick:  
   - Lead sets suit (unless Pirate, Escape, or Mermaid leads).  
   - Players follow suit if able; special cards may be played anytime.  
   - Highest valid card wins trick.  
   - Winner leads next trick.  
6. After all tricks are played, score the round.  
7. Next player becomes dealer. Increase hand size by 1 for next round.  

5. Core Mechanics  
**Card Rankings (Highest to Lowest):**  
1. Skull King (beats all)  
2. Other Pirates (first played wins if multiple; beats all numbered cards and Escapes)  
3. Mermaid (beats all numbered cards and Jolly Roger, loses to all Pirates except Skull King)  
   - Mermaid beats Skull King if played in same trick.  
   - If two Mermaids played, first wins.  
4. Jolly Roger (black suit; beats numbered cards of other suits)  
5. Numbered cards (14 highest, 1 lowest; must follow suit)  
6. Escape cards (lowest; lose trick unless all play Escapes — then first wins)  

**Special Rules for Expansion Cards:**  
- **Mermaid:**  
  - Beats all numbered cards and Jolly Roger.  
  - Loses to all Pirates except when played in same trick as Skull King — Mermaid wins.  
  - 50-point bonus if player captures Skull King with Mermaid **and** makes correct bid.  
- **Loot Card:**  
  - Acts as Escape card.  
  - If captured by another player, the capturer and player of Loot form an alliance.  
  - If both make correct bids, each gains 20 bonus points.  
  - If Loot leads and all others play Escape, original player wins trick — no alliance.  
  - If Loot leads, next card sets suit.  
- **Kraken:**  
  - Destroys entire trick. Cards are set aside. No one wins.  
  - Next trick led by player who would have won the trick had Kraken not been played.  
  - If Kraken leads, next card sets suit.  
  - If played after suit is set, players must still follow suit if able.  
- **Pirate Abilities (trigger when winning a trick with the Pirate):**  
  - **Rosie D’Laney:** Choose any player (including self) to lead next trick.  
  - **Bahij the Bandit:** Draw 2 cards, then discard any 2 face down beside deck.  
  - **Rascal of Roatan:** Wager 10 or 20 points. Gain if bid correct; lose if incorrect.  
  - **Juanita Jade:** Look at all undealt cards for the round. Do not reveal.  
  - **Harry the Giant:** Change your bid for the round by +1 or -1.  
  - **Note:** Abilities used immediately after trick is won. Do not carry between rounds. Only Harry and Rascal may use abilities on final trick of a round.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after final round. Player with highest total score wins.  
- **Correct Bid (non-zero):** +20 per trick won.  
- **Incorrect Bid:** -10 per trick difference from bid.  
- **Zero Bid Success:** +10 × number of cards dealt.  
- **Zero Bid Failure:** -10 × number of cards dealt.  
- **Bonus Points (only awarded if bid is correct):**  
  - Capture green/yellow/purple 14: +10  
  - Capture black Jolly Roger 14: +20  
  - Capture Pirate(s) with Skull King: +30 per Pirate
