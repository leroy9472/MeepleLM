# 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds across 3 years (12 seasons total):

1. **Roll Dice**: First player rolls all dice matching current season
2. **Draft Dice**: Starting with first player, each player selects one die clockwise
3. **Player Turns**: Each player takes turn in clockwise order:
   a. Resolve mandatory die actions first (energy, crystals)
   b. Perform any number of actions in any order:
      - Use remaining die actions
      - Summon/activate power cards
      - Use bonus actions
4. **Advance Time**: Move season token forward based on pips on unselected die
5. **Year Change**: If season token moves from 12 to 1:
   - Advance year token
   - Players add cards from corresponding library token to hand
6. **New First Player**: Player to left of previous first player becomes new first player
7. **Next Round**: New first player rolls appropriate season dice

# 5. Core Mechanics
**Season Die Actions** (must resolve energy/crystal actions first):
- Energy symbols: Gain corresponding energy tokens (max 7 in reserve)
- Number: Gain that many crystals (move on crystal track)
- Star: Increase summoning gauge by 1
- Card symbol: Draw a card, choose to keep or discard
- Circular border: May transmute energy to crystals at any point during turn using current season's rates

**Power Cards**:
- Two types: Magic Items (purple) and Familiars (orange)
- Three effect types:
  - Upon entering play: One-time effect when summoned
  - Permanent: Always active while in play
  - Activation: Pay cost and tap card (once per round)
- To summon: Pay cost and have available summoning gauge space
- Duplicates allowed; effects stack

**Bonus Actions** (max 3 per game, with VP penalty):
- Trade 2 energy of choice from reserve for 2 from stockpile
- Transmute energy with +1 crystal bonus per token
- Increase summoning gauge by 1
- When drawing card, draw 2 and keep 1

**Transmutation**:
- Convert energy to crystals using season-specific rates on board
- Rates vary by season and energy type (inner circle = 3 crystals, middle = 2, outer = 1)
- Can transmute multiple times during turn if die has circular border

# 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends immediately when season token crosses space 12 during third year.

Final score = 
- Crystals on track (1 VP each)
- Prestige points from power cards in play
- Minus 5 VP for each card remaining in hand
- Minus bonus track penalty (5/12/20 VP for 1/2/3 bonuses used)

Player with highest score wins. Tiebreaker: most power cards in play.

# 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Transmutation timing**: Always use season indicated by season token; if season changed during turn, use new season's rates
- **Hand of Fortune**: Reduces summoning cost by 1 energy (choice), but not below 1 energy; does not affect activation costs
- **Potion of Life**: Transmutes all energy in reserve (including Bespelled Grimoire) to 4 crystals each; can be activated without transmute action
- **Multiple effects**: Players choose order of resolution for multiple end-of-round effects
- **Card limits**: Max 7 energy tokens in reserve (unless modified by cards); max 15 summoning gauge
- **Negative values**: Cannot go below 0 on crystal track
- **Card interactions**: Card effects override game rules when in conflict
