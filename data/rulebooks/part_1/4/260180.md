## 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise, performing 3 actions per turn. Actions may be repeated unless restricted.

### Available Actions  
- **Take**: Take a face-up puzzle from a row or the top of a deck. Replace from the corresponding deck. Max 4 unfinished puzzles allowed.  
- **Recycle**: Remove all puzzles from a row, place them at the bottom of their deck in any order, then refill the row.  
- **Upgrade**: Return a piece from your supply to the reserve and take a replacement:  
  - Same level (different shape)  
  - One level higher  
  - Any lower level  
  If no piece is available at +1 level, take from the next available higher level.  
- **Place**: Place one piece from your supply onto one of your puzzles. Pieces may be rotated or flipped. Once placed, they cannot be moved until the puzzle is completed.  
- **Master (once per turn)**: Place up to one piece on each of your puzzles.  

### Completing Puzzles  
When a puzzle’s recessed area is fully filled:  
1. Return all pieces from the puzzle to your supply.  
2. Take the reward piece (shown in upper right) from the reserve.  
   - If unavailable, take any piece of the same level or next higher level.  
3. Place the completed puzzle face down on your Victory Point (VP) pile.  
Multiple puzzles may be completed in a single action.

### Taking Pieces from Reserve  
If a required piece is unavailable:  
- Take any piece of the same level.  
- If none, take any piece one level higher or any lower level.

### Known Victory Points (Optional)  
Players may agree to keep VP piles face up for transparency.

## 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Piece Levels**: Level 1 (1 square), Level 2 (2 squares), Level 3 (3 squares), Level 4 (4 squares).  
- **Engine Building**: Upgrade pieces and complete puzzles to gain more powerful pieces and higher scores.  
- **Action Efficiency**: Master Action allows multi-puzzle progress; timing upgrades and placements is key.  

### Ghost Piece Expansion  
- **Ghost Pieces**: Level-5 pieces (5 squares), obtained only by:  
  - Completing Ghost puzzles (reward shows Ghost piece)  
  - Using "Level Up" reward (↑ or ⌒) to upgrade a level-4 piece  
- **Ghost Action**: Return a Ghost piece to the reserve and take level 1–4 pieces that form its shape. You may immediately place up to one of these pieces per puzzle.  

### Ambassador Pack  
- **Ambassador Puzzles**: Complete to gain a one-time Ambassador Action (M icon).  
- **Ambassador Action**: Functions like Master Action but can be used multiple times per turn by flipping a completed M puzzle face down.  

### Finesse Expansion  
- **Finesse Tiles**: 10 tiles (2 from Set A, 2 from Set B, 6 from Set C) placed below Black puzzle row.  
  - First 2 face down, next 8 face up.  
- **Achieving Finesses**: Only the leftmost face-up tile is active.  
  - **Set A**: Place depicted pieces during turn → gain Credits.  
  - **Set B**: Have depicted pieces at end of turn → gain Credits.  
  - **Set C**: Various conditions (e.g., complete puzzle, use Master Action) → gain Credits.  
- **Credits**: Earned Credits are moved to the right of your mat at end of turn and become active.  
- **Insert Action**: Spend 2 active Credits to take an extra action (does not count toward 3-action limit). Master Action still limited to once per turn.  
- **Credit Bank**: If bank is empty when taking Credits, player(s) with most Credits return 1 to the bank.  

### Finesse Ambassador Pack  
Adds 10 Finesse tiles (2A, 2B, 6C) to be shuffled with base Finesse tiles. Rules otherwise unchanged.

### Line Clear Variant (4–6 players)  
1. Set up only 3 puzzles per row.  
2. Create a second set of 3 White and 3 Black puzzle rows on the opposite side.  
3. Place white markers: one between left rows, one given to First Player.  
4. Place black markers: one between right rows, one given to 3rd player (4–5 players) or 4th player (6 players).  
5. Players with markers play simultaneously:  
   - May only take puzzles from rows matching their marker.  
   - Only white-marker player may use Recycle or take from decks.  
6. After both players finish, pass markers clockwise.  
7. Game ends when First Player receives both markers again.

## 6. Scoring & End Game  
### Game End Trigger  
- **Base Game**: When Black puzzle deck is empty.  
- **Finesse Game**: When last Finesse tile is removed (end of round 10).  
- **Solo Game**: When puzzle deck is empty.  

### Final Rounds  
- **Base Game**: Finish current round, then all players take one final turn.  
- **Solo Game**: After deck is empty, player takes one final turn, then opponent takes a turn.  
- **Line Clear**: Play continues until First Player receives both markers again.  

### Finishing Touches  
After final round:  
- Place any number of pieces from your supply onto unfinished puzzles.  
- For each piece placed:  
  - Lose 1 VP  
  - Do not gain reward piece  
  - Do not return pieces upon completion  
- All Finishing Touches must be done simultaneously.  

### Final Scoring  
- Add VP from all completed puzzles.  
- Subtract VP for:  
  - Each unfinished puzzle (equal to its VP value)  
  - Each piece used in Finishing Touches (1 VP each)  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Most completed puzzles  
  2. Most pieces in supply  
  3. Shared victory  

*Finesse Game Tiebreaker*: Most Credits, then standard tiebreakers.
