## Glass Road — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
*Glass Road* is a Uwe Rosenberg strategy game centered on resource production, conversion, and efficient use of specialist actions to build processing and bonus buildings. Players manage dual production wheels to convert raw materials into glass and bricks, aiming to maximize victory points (VP) through building placement, resource stockpiling, and end-game scoring.

**Objective:** Score the most VP by the end of the game through buildings, unspent resources, and special scoring conditions.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **4 (or 5) Building Periods**, each with **3 Card Rounds**.

#### Start of a Building Period:  
- Each player takes all 15 Specialist Cards into hand.  
- Selects **5 cards** to keep; sets aside the other 10 (cannot be used this period).  

#### Each Card Round:  
1. **Simultaneous Selection:** All players choose 1 card from hand and place it **face-down**.  
2. **Reveal Phase:**  
   - Start player reveals their card.  
   - Other players check if they hold the **same card** in hand (not already face-down).  
     - If yes, they **must** play it immediately, placing it in one of two indentations on the **right side** of their board (max 2 per period).  
3. **Action Resolution:**  
   - **If no opponent played the card:**  
     - Active player may use **both abilities** (in any order), paying cost only once.  
   - **If at least one opponent played it:**  
     - Active player may use **only one ability**.  
   - Opponents who played the card may each use **one ability** (choose independently).  
   - Resolve effects in order: active player first, then others clockwise.  
4. **Next Player:** Proceed clockwise to next player who hasn’t revealed; repeat until all cards revealed.  
5. Repeat for 3 rounds. After final round, discard remaining hand cards (0–2 cards left is normal).

#### End of a Building Period:  
- Refill empty spaces on Building Board from stacks.  
- Pass Start Player Goblet **clockwise**.  
- **3-Player Game Exception:** After 3rd period, pass goblet to player with **fewest buildings** (clockwise tiebreaker).  
- **5-Period Game:** Apply above rule for 5th period start player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Production Wheel:  
- Tracks resources: wood, clay, sand, water, food, charcoal.  
- **Producing** a resource: Move token **clockwise**.  
- **Consuming** a resource: Move token **counterclockwise**.  
- **Cannot** move below 0.  
- **Rotation Rule:**  
  - After any transaction, if **both brown sectors** (glass and brick) are empty, rotate wheel clockwise until **at least one** is filled.  
  - Rotation converts raw materials → glass/brick:  
    - Top half (Glassworks): wood + sand + water → glass  
    - Bottom half (Brickworks): clay + food + charcoal → brick  
  - Rotation may occur multiple times in succession.  
  - **Cannot** rotate during a transaction (e.g., mid-building purchase).

#### Resource Gains:  
- When gaining **food or charcoal**, choose **one wheel** to add all to — **cannot split** between wheels.  
- May take **fewer** than maximum allowed.

#### Anytime (Free) Actions:  
May be taken **at any time**, even out of turn. One at a time.  
- **Use Processing (Blue) Buildings:** Perform trade as shown, any number of times.  
  - Remember to resolve wheel rotations between uses.  
- **Remove Landscape Tiles:** Remove **Pits, Groves, or Ponds** for free at any time (e.g., to make space).  
  - **Forests** can only be removed via card or building effects.  
  - **Buildings** cannot be removed.

#### Building Placement:  
- **Wood-border tiles:** Placed on empty space.  
- **Brick-border tiles:** Upgrades; placed **on top** of specified starting building.  
  - Original building is replaced; only upgrade scores.  
- Adjacency: Orthogonal only (no diagonals).  
- **Tavern Rule:** Using a Tavern allows re-triggering an adjacent **Immediate (Yellow)** building as if just placed.

#### Card Costs:  
- Red banner cost must be paid **only if using an ability**.  
- If playing a card but using **no ability**, no cost is paid.  
- Cost is same regardless of using one or both abilities.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End of Game:** After 4 (or 5) building periods.  
- Players may use **Processing Buildings any number of times** before scoring.

**Scoring Sources:**  
- **Building VP:** As printed on tile.  
- **Bonus Buildings:** Score VP as described.  
- **Starting Buildings (if not upgraded):**  
  - **Brotherhood of Masons:** +1 VP per remaining **brick**  
  - **Forest Glassworks:** +1 VP per remaining **glass**  
  - **Glassmakers Colony:** +½ VP per remaining **sand** (do not round)  
- **Upgraded buildings score; original does not.**  
- **Adjacency:** Only orthogonal adjacency counts. Starting buildings count for adjacency.

**Winning:** Highest VP wins. **Tie:** Multiple winners (no tiebreaker).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I rotate wheel mid-transaction?** No. Only after full transaction.  
- **Can I split 2+ food/charcoal between wheels?** No. All must go to one wheel.  
- **Can I use a Processing Building during another player’s turn?** Yes — anytime action.  
- **What if I have 3 cards left at end of period?** In 2P game, you may play one more. In 3P/4P, this should not happen.  
- **Do I pay cost if I don’t use an ability?** No.  
- **Can I remove a forest anytime?** No. Only via card or building action.  
- **Can I use both abilities if opponent plays same card but can’t due to full right-side slots?** No — if any opponent **could** have played it (and didn’t due to full slots), active player still only gets one ability.  
- **Do I resolve wheel rotation after each resource gain?** Only after a full transaction (e.g., after completing a card action or trade).
