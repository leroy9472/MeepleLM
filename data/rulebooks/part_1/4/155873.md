## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Power Grid*, players compete as energy companies striving to build the most efficient and expansive electricity network across a region (Europe or North America). The goal is to power the greatest number of cities in the final round of play. Victory is achieved through strategic acquisition of power plants, efficient resource management, and smart network expansion.

### 2. Components
- Game Board (Europe / North America sides)  
- Power Plant Cards (dark-back: 03–15; light-back: 20+) and Step 3 Card  
- Resource Tokens: Coal (brown), Gas (blue), Oil (black), Uranium (red)  
- Elektros (currency)  
- Player Materials per player:
  - 22 Generators (in one color)
  - 1 Payment Summary Card
  - 1 marker for Turn Order Track
  - 1 marker for Score Track
- Trackers:
  - Turn Order Track (with left/right columns)
  - Score Track (with White and Black Sticks)
- Sticks:
  - White Stick (triggers Step 2)
  - Black Stick (triggers End Game)
- Discount Token (North America only, value 1 Elektro)

### 3. Setup
1. **Choose Map**: Select Europe or North America side of the board.
2. **Select Areas**: For 3/4/5/6 players, use 3/4/5/5 contiguous areas; block others.
3. **Distribute Player Materials**:
   - Each player receives 50 Elektros, 22 Generators in one color, and a Payment Summary Card.
   - Place 1 Generator on the '0' space of the Score Track.
   - Place 1 Generator in the left column of the Turn Order Track in random order.
4. **Set Resource Supply**:
   - Coal: boxes 2–8
   - Gas: boxes 3–8
   - Oil: boxes 3–9 (Europe), 4–9 (North America)
   - Uranium: boxes 8–9 (Europe), 9 only (North America)
5. **Power Plant Market Setup**:
   - Shuffle dark-back Power Plant Cards (03–15).
   - Draw 9 (Europe) or 8 (North America) cards; place in market in ascending order, lowest in top row, left to right.
   - For North America: draw 1 additional dark-back card and set it aside facedown.
6. **Remove Cards** (3 or 4 players only):
   - 3 players: remove 2 dark-back and 6 light-back cards
   - 4 players: remove 1 dark-back and 3 light-back cards
7. **Form Draw Deck**:
   - Shuffle remaining light and dark-back cards together.
   - Place Step 3 Card at the bottom.
   - For North America: place the set-aside card on top of the deck.
8. **Place Sticks**:
   - White Stick (Step 2 trigger): before 7/7/7/6 (3/4/5/6 players)
   - Black Stick (End Game trigger): before 17/17/15/14 (3/4/5/6 players)

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds in 5 phases:

#### Phase 1: Determine Player Order
- Skip in Round 1 (initial order is random).
- Order players by:
  1. Number of cities connected (descending)
  2. Highest-numbered power plant (tiebreaker)
- Rearrange Generators in the left column of the Turn Order Track accordingly.

#### Phase 2: Auction Power Plants
- Players act in turn order.
- Each player may buy **one** power plant per round.
- Process:
  1. Active player selects one of the available power plants (top row in Steps 1–2; all 6 in Step 3).
  2. Bidding proceeds clockwise; minimum bid = card number (unless modified).
  3. Players may raise or pass; once passed, they may not re-enter this auction.
  4. Winner pays bid, takes card, moves Generator to right column of Turn Order Track.
  5. Replace with new card from deck; reorder market.
- Special Rules:
  - **4th Plant Rule**: When buying a 4th plant, discard one existing plant. Transfer compatible resources to remaining plants; excess returned to supply.
  - **Minimum Rule**: If any plant in the market has a number ≤ leading player’s city count, remove it immediately and replace.
  - **Last Bidder Rule**: If only one player remains eligible to bid, they pay the minimum bid.
- Regional Variants:
  - **North America**: At start of Phase 2, place Discount Token on lowest-numbered plant (min bid = 1). If not bought, remove it and replace.
  - **Europe**: If no plant is sold this phase, remove the lowest-numbered plant and replace it.
- **Step 3 Trigger**: If Step 3 Card is drawn:
  - Remove it and the smallest plant in the market.
  - Game enters Step 3: market now has 6 plants (no future row), all available for auction.

#### Phase 3: Buy Resources
- Players act in **reverse turn order**.
- Buy resources from the Resource Market at listed prices.
- Each power plant may store up to **twice** the number of resource symbols shown.
  - Hybrid (gas/oil): total storage across both types = 2× symbols.
  - Ecological (wind/solar): no storage.
- Players may rearrange resources among their plants at any time (within storage limits).

> After this phase: Move all Generators on Turn Order Track back to the left column.

#### Phase 4: Build Generators
- Players act in **reverse turn order**.
- Build new generators to expand network:
  - **First generator**: Place in any city; pay building cost (space number, usually 10 Elektros).
  - **Subsequent generators**: Must connect to existing network via cheapest path; pay building cost + connection cost.
- Rules:
  - Max 1 generator per standard city (except Metropolises in North America).
  - Building costs: 10/15/20 Elektros for 1st/2nd/3rd generator in a city.
  - May pass through unoccupied cities; may use multiple connections.
  - Immediately advance on Score Track when building.
- **Step Changes**:
  - **Step 1**: 1 player per city
  - **Step 2**: 2 players per city
  - **Step 3**: 3 players per city
- **Step 2 Trigger**: When any player crosses the White Stick:
  - Finish current phase, then enter Step 2.
  - Regional differences:
    - **North America**: Remove lowest plant, replace from deck.
    - **Europe**: Remove lowest plant, do **not** replace; shift cheapest from bottom row to top.
- **End Game Trigger**: If any player crosses the Black Stick, finish the phase and proceed to End Game.

> After this phase: Move all Generators on Turn Order Track back to the left column.

#### Phase 5: Bureaucracy
1. **Pay Players** (in turn order):
   - Each declares how many cities they power (up to network size and plant capacity).
   - Payment based on number powered (see Payment Summary Card).
   - Players who power 0 cities receive 10 Elektros (guaranteed minimum).
   - Power plant operation:
     - Requires full resource cost (shown on card).
     - Hybrid: any combination of gas/oil.
     - Ecological: no resources needed.
     - Surplus electricity is wasted.
     - Consumed resources go to supply (not market).
2. **Resupply Resource Market**:
   - Based on current Step and number of players (see Refill Summary Card).
   - Fill most expensive available spaces first.
3. **Update Power Plant Market**:
   - **Steps 1–2**: Move highest-numbered plant from market to bottom of deck; draw replacement.
   - **Step 3**: Remove lowest-numbered plant from market; draw replacement if possible.
   - Apply Minimum Rule if needed.
   - If Step 3 Card is drawn, trigger Step 3 (as in Phase 2).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Turn Order**: Based on network size and plant strength; changes each round.
- **Auction System**: Open ascending bid; each player one purchase per round.
- **Resource Management**: Strategic buying and storage; prices rise as supply depletes.
- **Network Expansion**: Pay for both building and connection costs; pathfinding matters.
- **Step Progression**:
  - Step 1 → Step 2: Triggered when a player builds 7th/7th/7th/6th city (3/4/5/6 players).
  - Step 2 → Step 3: Triggered when Step 3 Card is drawn.
  - Step 3: All 6 market plants available; no future row.
- **End Game Trigger**: When a player builds 17th/17th/15th/14th city (3/4/5/6 players).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends **immediately** after Phase 4 when a player crosses the Black Stick.
- Final scoring occurs during **Phase 5: Bureaucracy** of that round.
- Winner is the player who can power the **most cities** using their current:
  - Power plants
  - Available resources
- **Tiebreaker**: Most remaining Elektros.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Q**: What if the deck runs out during replacement?
  - **A**: Do not replace the plant. Market continues with fewer cards.
- **Q**: Can I power fewer cities than I have?
  - **A**: Yes. You may choose to underpower for strategic reasons.
- **Q**: What happens if Step 3 is triggered before Step 2?
  - **A**: Perform Step 2 changes first (remove lowest plant, adjust market), then Step 3 changes.
- **Q**: Can I rearrange resources at any time?
  - **A**: Yes, as long as storage limits are respected.
- **Q**: What if multiple players cross the Black Stick in the same phase?
  - **A**: Game ends after the phase; all players get one final Bureaucracy phase.
