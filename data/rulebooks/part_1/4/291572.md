### 1. Lore & Objective
Oath: Chronicles of Empire & Exile is a game about the rise and fall of empires in a fantastical land. Players take on roles as the Chancellor, Exiles, and Citizens, competing for control and legacy. The goal is to win the current game through one of several victory conditions, then shape the world for future games by writing the Chronicle.

Victory can be achieved in multiple ways:
- **Usurper Win**: An Exile wins by holding the Oathkeeper title on its Usurper side during their Wake phase.
- **Visionary Win**: An Exile wins by revealing a Vision and completing its goal (requires at least three Visions drawn).
- **Stable Regime Win**: The Chancellor (or a Citizen) wins if a die roll ends the game on rounds 5–7, depending on the round.
- **War Exhaustion Win**: At the end of round 8, the winner is determined by checking conditions in order: Empire (Oathkeeper), Usurper, Visionary, then Empire.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Major Actions
- **Search** (5.1): Spend 2–4 Supply. Draw 3 cards from world deck (cost based on Visions Drawn track) or discard pile (cost 2). If drawing from world deck, stop and advance Visions Drawn if a Vision is drawn. Discard 2 cards, play 1 to site, advisers, or discard. Playing to site grants 1 Favor from matching suit bank.
- **Muster** (5.2): Spend 1 Supply, place 1 Favor on empty denizen/edifice at your site. Gain 2 Warbands.
- **Trade** (5.3): Spend 1 Supply. Choose:
  - Place 1 Secret on empty card → gain 1 Favor + 1 per matching faceup adviser (from card’s suit bank).
  - Place 2 Favor on empty card → gain 1 Secret per matching faceup adviser.
- **Recover** (5.4): Spend 1 Supply. Target:
  - Facedown relic at your site (pay site’s cost: place Favor, burn Favor, or burn Secret).
  - Any banner (People's Favor: pay more Favor than current; Darkest Secret: pay more Secrets than current). Can only recover Darkest Secret if any card at holder’s site doesn’t match any of their advisers.
- **Campaign** (5.5): Spend 2 Supply. Choose defender (other player at/ruling your site, or bandits). Declare targets:
  - Defender’s sites (anywhere).
  - Defender’s relics/banners (if their pawn at your site).
  - Defender’s pawn and favor (if their pawn at your site).
  Must declare at least one target at your site; must target your site if defender rules it.
  - Attacker adds attack dice up to warbands on board.
  - Use battle plans: attacker first, then defender.
  - Defender rolls defense pool:
    - Add Shields rolled; each △ doubles total Shields.
    - Add 1 per warband at targeted sites.
    - Add 1 per warband on defender’s board if their pawn at attacker’s site or any targeted site.
  - Attacker rolls attack pool:
    - Each ♠ skull kills 1 warband on attacker’s board.
    - Add Swords rolled: two □ count as one ■; single □ counts as 0.
    - Add 1 per sacrificed warband.
  - Compare totals: higher wins; tie goes to defender.
  - Defeated player: kill half warbands in force (rounded down), move rest to board.
  - Victor: take rule of targeted sites (place 0+ warbands), take targeted relics/banners, banish pawn and burn half favor (if targeted).
- **Travel** (5.6): Spend 1–4 Supply. Move pawn to destination site. If facedown, flip and resolve reveal prompt (place Favor/Secrets, place relics).

#### Minor Actions (0 Supply)
- Play or discard facedown adviser.
- Use Action power on accessible card.
- Peek at relic at your site.
- Peek at Imperial Reliquary (if hold Grand Scepter).
- Move warbands to/from your site (if you rule it; cannot move last warband).
- Offer Citizenship (if hold Grand Scepter).
- Exile a Citizen (if hold Grand Scepter).

#### Powers
- **Access** (7.1.1): Use card power if you rule it or your pawn is at its site.
- **Cost** (7.1.2): Pay cost (favor, secret, burn) if required.
- **Use** (7.1.3): Resolve as much as possible.
- **Persistent Powers** (7.1.4): Affect all described players, ignore access.
- **Standalone Powers**:
  - Wake: during Wake Phase.
  - Action: during Act Phase.
  - When Played: after playing card faceup.
  - Rest: during Rest Phase, after other steps.
- **Battle Plans** (7.5): Campaign modifiers; only usable if you rule the card; used in Campaign step 3; can pay cost even if favor/secrets already on card.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### Ending Conditions
- **Stable Regime**: End of rounds 5–7: roll die. Ends on 6 (round 5), 5–6 (round 6), 3–6 (round 7). Chancellor wins unless Citizen meets Successor goal.
- **War Exhaustion**: End of round 8. Check in order:
  1. Empire if Chancellor or Citizen is Oathkeeper → Chancellor wins (Citizen wins if meets Successor goal).
  2. Usurper → that Exile wins.
  3. Visionary → that Exile wins (tiebreak: Conquest > Rebellion > Sanctuary > Faith).
  4. Empire → Chancellor wins (Citizen wins if meets Successor goal).

#### Successor Goal (3.3.1)
If Chancellor would win, Citizen wins instead if they meet:
- Supremacy (Sites): holds more relics and banners than Chancellor and other Citizens.
- The People (People's Favor): holds Darkest Secret.
- Protection (Relics+Banners): holds People's Favor.
- Devotion (Darkest Secret): holds Grand Scepter.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Ties in Campaign**: Go to defender.
- **Multiple Oathkeepers**: Holder keeps title if tied; if multiple others meet goal, holder chooses who takes it.
- **Imperial Players Defending**: Chancellor joins as ally; Citizens may join with permission. Allies add warbands and battle plans.
- **Citizens Campaigning**: When Citizen attacks Chancellor or another Citizen, they are not Imperial during Campaign.
- **Component Limits**: Gain/take as many as possible if source is insufficient.
- **Private Information**: Discard pile fronts, world deck order, facedown cards, adviser counts are private. Everything else is public.
- **No Unprompted Losses**: Cannot place/burn/sacrifice resources beyond what a cost or requirement prompts.
- **No Unprompted Binding Promises**: Only Citizenship offers and "binding" powers create binding agreements.
