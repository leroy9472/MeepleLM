## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Dungeon Petz is a strategic game where players manage a pet-breeding dungeon, raising bizarre magical creatures while balancing their needs—hunger, anger, play, magic, disease, and poop. The goal is to gain the most Reputation Points (VP) by successfully caring for pets, scoring well in exhibitions, selling pets to customers, and managing resources efficiently. Poor care leads to suffering, escaped pets, or mutations—each carrying penalties.

#### Phase 2: Shopping

- Assign 1 Need card per colored bar and per accessory.  
  - Potion cards can substitute any color.

1. **Hunger**: Discard 1 matching Food → or add 1 Suffering.  
2. **Poop**: Add 1 Manure to cage.  
3. **Play**: Use 1 available Imp → or add 1 Suffering. 1 Imp can satisfy 2 adjacent pets.  
4. **Anger**: If anger > cage strength, pet tries to escape.  
   - Use available Imps (1 per excess anger) → send to Hospital.  
   - If not enough, pet **lost**.  
5. **Magic**: If magic > cage anti-magic, add 1 Mutation per excess.  
   - 2 Mutations → pet **lost**.  
6. **Disease**: If (Disease cards + Manure in cage) > 2 →  
   - Add 1 Suffering + 1 per point over 2.  
   - *Poop resolved before Disease*.  
7. **Potion**: Discard corresponding Need card; pet requires nothing.  

- **Pet Death**: If Suffering ≥ pet size → **lost**.  
- **Losing a Pet**: Remove pet; discard Suffering/Mutation/Need cards; lose 1 VP per 10 VP.
