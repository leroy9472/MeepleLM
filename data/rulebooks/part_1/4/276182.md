### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Dead Reckoning*, players command privateer vessels navigating uncharted waters, exploring islands, building influence, and engaging in naval combat. The goal is to achieve victory by completing four Achievements, triggering the endgame, and then scoring the most coins through Achievements, treasure, buildings, ship upgrades, and island control.

### 2. Components
- 1 Harbor board
- 16 Ocean boards (12 with islands, 4 open sea)
- 4 Advancement/Encounter decks (by Row)
- 80 Coins, 40 Cargo tokens
- 32 Basic/Advanced Ship Upgrade tiles
- 16 Damage markers
- 30 Buildings (10 Forts, 10 Garrisons, 10 Outposts)
- 20 Black cubes
- 1 Battle Ship and 1 Battle board
- 80 Card sleeves
- 4 Player sets: Dock tile, Ship board, Ship miniature, Pirate mode marker, Treasure chest, 35 colored cubes, 11 Achievement markers
- 48 Sailor cards (12 per player: Captain, Purser, First Mate, Bosun, Buccaneer, Gunners, Deck Hands, Crew)
- 8 Bonus Achievement tokens
- 3 Token storage boxes

### 3. Setup
1. Place Harbor board; arrange 12 Ocean boards in a 3×4 grid (8–10 island boards + open seas based on player count). Flip the three boards adjacent to Harbor face up.
2. Place Advancement boxes by Row; place one Row 1 card face up on each of the three revealed Ocean boards.
3. Each player receives:
   - 15 Coins in Treasure chest
   - 35 colored cubes
   - 1 Ship on Harbor
   - 1 Dock tile
   - 11 Achievement markers
   - 1 Pirate mode marker
   - 12-card Sailor deck (shuffled)
4. Each player draws 4 cards.
5. Randomly determine first player. Starting player order gains:
   - 1st: 1 Cargo
   - 2nd: 2 Cargo
   - 3rd: 3 Cargo
   - 4th: 2 Cargo + may level up one card before first turn
6. Each player receives 2 Bonus Achievement tokens, keeps 1, discards the other.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn has three phases:

**1. Main Phase (actions in any order except sailing/movement):**
- Load/unload/rearrange/jettison Cargo and Coins
- Play cards from hand
- Set Sails (once per turn)
- Move Ship (orthogonal only, up to Sails value)
- Buy Advancements or resolve Encounters (max 2 per turn)
- Use abilities from played cards (each once per turn)

**2. Cleanup Phase (in order):**
1. Refill empty Advancement/Encounter spaces from corresponding Row box (use next higher Row if empty)
2. Choose Pirate or Mercantile mode (Mercantile is default; Harbor forces Mercantile)
3. Reset Sails track to 0
4. Sleeve Advancements (onto cards played this turn; max 3 per card; may keep 1 unsleeved)
5. Discard all played cards; draw up to 4 cards (hand limit 6, modifiable by islands)

**3. Off-Turn Leveling:**
- At any time before next turn, level up one Sailor card in hand (rotate/flip Ability card to next level)

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Sailing & Movement:**
- Set Sails by counting Sail icons on Ship and played cards (max 8)
- Sails from covered holds count only if setting Sails from Harbor or controlled island
- Move orthogonally; stop on unexplored board to explore (flip, add Advancement; only 1 per turn)

**Advancements & Encounters:**
- Buy Advancements by paying Cargo; sleeve during Cleanup
- Encounters (e.g., Merchants): Trade (buy as Advancement) or Attack (battle)
- Max 2 Advances/Encounters resolved per turn

**Pirate Mode:**
- Choose at Cleanup if not in Harbor
- Opponent stopping on your space must battle
- Winning a battle while in Pirate mode blockades the island (opponent cannot place/remove cubes, load/unload, attack buildings)
- Losing a battle reverts to Mercantile mode

**Battles:**
Three types: Player vs. Player, Player vs. NPC, Player vs. Building

**General Battle Flow:**
1. **Take Battle Cubes:**
   - Each Cannon = 1 cube
   - Player vs. Player: Active player declares first, then inactive player may play cards
   - Defender at controlled island: +1 cube per Building
   - Defender in Harbor: +4 cubes
   - Player vs. Building: Defender gets 5 (Fort), 2 (Garrison), or 7 (both) cubes
2. **Drop Cubes:**
   - All cubes dropped simultaneously into Battle Ship
   - Fully balanced cubes on borders are re-dropped
   - Exploding Shots: Each cube in zone is re-dropped with +1 extra cube
3. **Resolve Battle Abilities:**
   - Player vs. Player: Active player starts; players alternate using one ability or passing until both pass consecutively
   - Player vs. NPC or Building: Attacker uses abilities in any order (only attacker in Building battles)
4. **Plunder:**
   - Skip for Building battles
   - Plunder cubes: Gain Cargo/Coins; must fit on Ship, island, or discard
5. **Damage:**
   - Each cube in Damage zone causes 1 damage to opponent’s Ship
6. **Determine Winner:**
   - Total crown symbols (Battle Strength)
   - Active player wins ties
   - Loser takes 1 damage (unless ship is sunk)
   - If losing ship was in Pirate mode, revert to Mercantile

**Sinking Ships:**
- 5+ damage = ship sinks
- All Coins on Ship are lost
- If fewer than 5 Coins on Ship, take difference from Treasure chest to total 5 lost
- Coins go to attacker’s chest; if not player-caused, go to supply
- Sunk ship returns to Harbor, damage removed, Sails = 0, Mercantile mode
- Attacker gains Terror of the Sea Achievement (if first time)
- Attacker may take 1 Saga item (if applicable)

**Island Control:**
- Control requires:
  - More cubes than any other player
  - More cubes than empty slots
- Upon gaining control, place 1 permanent cube (cannot be removed)
- If control changes during turn, new controller immediately places permanent cube
- Forts/Garrisons block interaction (except buying Advances)

**Buildings:**
- Construct via card abilities
- Max one of each type (Fort, Garrison, Outpost) per island
- Outposts: +1 Cargo, +1 Coin production; cannot be attacked
- Forts: Block opponent interaction; defense = 5 cubes
- Garrisons: Same as Forts; +1 damage to passing ships; defense = 2 cubes

**Achievements:**
- Claim immediately upon meeting conditions
- Once claimed, cannot be lost
- 9 Achievements:
  - **Legendary:** Win 4 non-Building battles
  - **Expert Sailors:** 3 level 4 cards
  - **Terror of the Sea:** Sink an opponent’s ship
  - **Builder:** Control 5+ Buildings
  - **Capitalist:** 30+ Coins in chest (must announce)
  - **Settler:** 6+ permanent cubes across islands
  - **Elite Vessel:** 4 Ship Upgrades (including covered)
  - **Explorer:** Explore 5 (2p), 4 (3p), or 3 (4p) boards
  - **Master Merchant:** Return 12 Cargo at once to supply

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End Game Trigger:**
- After any player’s turn, if they have 4+ Achievements, all other players take one final turn

**Final Turn Effects:**
- After final turn:
  - Opponent needs 2 actions to replace each of player’s influence cubes
  - Player gains +2 Battle cubes in any battle
- Players draw cards normally but cannot level up

**Scoring:**
- **Achievements:** Value of completed Achievements
- **Coins:** In Treasure chest, on Ship, on controlled islands
- **Buildings:** 1 Coin each on controlled islands
- **Advancements:** 1 Coin per 2 Advancements (sleeved or set aside)
- **Ship Upgrades:** 1 Coin per Basic, 2 Coins per Advanced
- **End of Game Advancements:** Apply scoring effects
- **Islands:** For each island:
  - Most cubes: highest coin value
  - Second most: second value
  - Third most: third value (if available)
  - Tie: all tied players score next lower value; tie for third = no score
  - Empty slots count as a player for scoring

**Winning:**
- Highest coin total wins
- Tie: Players count Cannons on Ship and all cards in deck; drop that many cubes into Battle Ship
  - Resolve Exploding Shots only
  - Highest Battle Strength wins
  - Repeat if tied
  - May involve more than two players

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Jettisoning:** Allowed after attack is announced, before cube drop; not during battle
- **Cubes:** If supply runs out, use non-permanent island cubes (if control unchanged)
- **Multiple Battles:** Cannons and Battle abilities can only be used once per turn across all battles
- **Sleeving:** Advancements must be sleeved onto cards played this turn; may keep one unsleeved
- **Final Turn Bonus:** +2 Battle cubes apply to both Ship and Building battles
- **Saga Items:** Only taken if sinking opponent’s ship; not if both ships sink
- **Building Attacks:** Cannot attack if opponent Ship is in Pirate mode; must defeat first
