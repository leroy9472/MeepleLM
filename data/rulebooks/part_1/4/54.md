## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Each player leads an expedition to uncover the lost Mayan temples of Tikal, hidden beneath dense jungle for over 1,000 years. The goal is to score the most Prestige points by controlling temples and collecting treasure across multiple scoring rounds. The game ends after the final terrain tile is placed, and the player with the highest score wins.

2. **Components**  
- 1 Game board (with Base Camp, two starting Temples, and one Clearing pre-placed)  
- 36 hexagonal Terrain tiles (sorted by letters A–G)  
  - Types: Temple, Clearing/Jungle, Ruin/Treasure, Volcano  
- 24 Treasure tokens (round discs with golden masks)  
- 48 Resin Temple pieces (numbered tiers: 2–10, with quantities: 3×2, 6×3, 9×4, 11×5, 8×6, 5×7, 3×8, 2×9, 1×10)  
- 4 Player aids (reference cards for actions and AP costs)  
- For each of 2–4 players:  
  - 1 Expedition Leader (counts as 3 explorers for temple control)  
  - 18 Explorers (workers)  
  - 2 Forward Camps  
  - 1 Scoring marker  
  - 1 Totem token (used in Auction variant)  

3. **Setup**  
- Place the board in the center.  
- Sort Terrain tiles by letter (A–G), shuffle each lettered set, and stack them in order (A on top, then B, etc.). Place face-down.  
- Shuffle Treasure tokens and place them in two face-down stacks.  
- Sort Temple pieces by number and place in stacks by the board.  
- Each player takes all components in one color.  
- Place scoring markers at "1" on the track (basic game) or at "20" (Auction variant).  
- In Auction variant, place Totem tokens face-up.  
- Determine starting player (oldest player in basic game; determined by auction in variant).  

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
On a player’s turn:  
1. **Draw and Place a Terrain Tile**  
   - Draw the top tile from the stack.  
   - Place it adjacent to an existing explored tile or Base Camp.  
   - Must create at least one valid path (at least one stone marker on either tile at the shared edge).  
   - Exception: Volcano tiles may be placed adjacent regardless of stone markers.  
2. **Use up to 10 Action Points (AP)**  
   - Perform any combination of actions in any order.  
   - Unused AP are lost.  

**Actions (AP Cost):**  
- **Place Explorer or Leader**: 1 AP (on Base Camp or own Forward Camp).  
- **Move between Camps**: 1 AP (between Base Camp and any Forward Camp of same color).  
- **Move to Adjacent Tile**: 1 AP per stone marker on the shared edge.  
- **Uncover Temple Level**: 2 AP per level (max 2 levels per turn on one temple; requires 1 Explorer per level uncovered).  
- **Excavate Treasure**: 3 AP per treasure (max 2 per turn; requires 1 Explorer per treasure).  
- **Establish Forward Camp**: 5 AP (Explorer must be on tile; only on Jungle, Clearing, or empty Ruin).  
- **Place Temple Guard**: 5 AP (must have majority on temple; Expedition Leader = 3 Explorers; max 2 guards per player).  
- **Exchange Treasure**: 3 AP (with any player; cannot split existing pairs/triplets; cannot exchange part of set).  

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Tile Placement**: Must connect via at least one stone marker.  
- **Movement**: Requires stone markers; Volcanoes are impassable.  
- **Temple Control**: Scored during scoring rounds if:  
  - You have a Guard, or  
  - You have majority of Explorers (Leader = 3).  
  - Tie: no one scores.  
- **Treasure Scoring**:  
  - 1 treasure: 1 point  
  - 2 identical: 3 points  
  - 3 identical: 6 points  
  - Sets cannot be split once formed.  
- **Scoring Rounds**: Triggered when:  
  - A **Volcano tile is drawn** (3 in total):  
    - Set tile aside.  
    - Starting with drawer, each player uses 10 AP, then scores.  
    - After all score, drawer places the Volcano and takes a normal turn.  
  - **Final Scoring**: After last tile is placed:  
    - Player who placed it uses 10 AP.  
    - Scoring round begins with player to their left (clockwise).  
    - Each uses 10 AP, then scores.  
- **Auction Variant (Advanced Rules)**:  
  - Players start at 20 VP.  
  - Each round, reveal N tiles (N = players).  
  - Bid VP to determine turn order: highest bidder chooses tile and goes first, pays VP, flips Totem.  
  - Bidding continues for 2nd, 3rd, etc. Last player takes remaining tile for free.  
  - Next round: first bidder is clockwise from last player of prior round.  
  - Final scoring: players score in **ascending order of VP** (lowest first). Ties broken by clockwise proximity to last tile placer.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- **Scoring Rounds** (4 total: 3 from Volcanoes, 1 final)  
  - Temples: value = topmost number (if controlled).  
  - Treasures: scored in sets (1:1, 2:3, 3:6).  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - All players get 10 AP, then score.  
  - Winner: highest total Prestige points.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Highest-value Temple with a Guard.  
  2. Most Treasure tokens.  
  3. Shared victory if still tied.

- **Can you move an Explorer directly from supply to a Forward Camp?** Yes, for 1 AP.
