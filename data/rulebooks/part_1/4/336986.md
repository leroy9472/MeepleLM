   - Use ability of any 1 Artisan Dragon at the shop.  
   - All dragons of same type share ability (see Abilities section).  
4. **(Optional) Use Shop Ability**:  
   - Use shop’s printed ability if it has one.  
   - Only usable when Gathering, not Enchanting.  

#### Filling a Shop

   - Choose a faceup Enchantment matching the shop’s icon (or any if shop has ★).  
   - Pay cost in Goods (Coins may substitute unless card has ❌ symbol).  
   - Tuck Enchantment behind shop (now produces +1 Good).  
   - Gain rewards shown (Reputation, Dragon draw, Coin, etc.).  
2. **(Optional) Fire Up All Dragons**:  
   - Use ability of *each* Artisan Dragon at the shop, in any order.

#### Enchantment Clarifications

- **Moon Dragons** (☾): Score only at end of game.

  - Refresh Enchantments to 5.  
  - Reveal all facedown shops.
