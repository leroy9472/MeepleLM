# Turing Machine - Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
British mathematician and cryptanalyst Alan Turing made significant contributions to the advent of computers. In this game, players use a proto-computer (working without electricity or electronics) to find secret codes. The objective is to be the first player to deduce the only code that satisfies all Verifier criteria.

The secret code consists of three numbers between 1 and 5:
- a ▲ (triangle) number,
- a ■ (square) number,
- and a ● (circle) number.

Players must deduce the criteria used by each Verifier and determine the only code that passes all Verifier tests.

## 2. Components
- Machine tile
- Punch-card support
- Punch cards (colored by shape: ▲, ■, ●)
- Criteria cards (numbered 1–48)
- Verification cards
- Player aids (doubles as screens)
- Note sheets
- Writing instrument

## 3. Setup
1. Place the Machine tile in the center of the table.
2. Assemble the punch-card support and insert punch cards in numerical order (all 1s first, then 2s, etc.).
3. Choose a problem (e.g., from the booklet or online).
4. Assign Criteria cards to Verifiers (e.g., A: card 4, B: card 9, C: card 11, D: card 14).
5. Place the corresponding Verification card face down next to each Criteria card.
6. Mark the back of each Verification card with its Verifier letter (A, B, C, or D).
7. Give each player a Player Aid and a note sheet.
8. For games using fewer than 6 Verifiers, draw a line through unused Verifier columns on the note sheet.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds. All players act simultaneously:

1. **Compose**: Create a 3-digit proposal by overlaying one ▲, one ■, and one ● punch card.
2. **Question**: Question up to 3 Verifiers (without changing the proposal). Place the Verifier’s Verification card under the punch cards, aligning corner symbols. Observe the answer (✓ or ×) through the single visible hole.
3. **Deduce**: Return cards to the support. Analyze answers and record deductions on the note sheet.
4. **End of Round**: After all players finish questioning and deducing, simultaneously reveal thumbs:
   - **Thumb up**: Believes they have found the code.
   - **Thumb down**: Still deducing.
   - If all thumbs are down, begin a new round.
   - If one or more players raise thumbs, proceed to Verification.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Verifiers**: Each Verifier checks one specific criterion (e.g., "The number is odd"). Criteria are listed on the Criteria card; only one is active per game.
- **Proposals**: A combination of three numbers (▲, ■, ●) formed by overlapping punch cards.
- **Answers**: Each Verifier responds with ✓ (pass) or × (fail) based on whether the proposal meets their hidden criterion.
- **Note Sheet Usage**: Players must record:
  - Each proposal.
  - Answers (✓ or ×) from each questioned Verifier.
  - Eliminated numbers.
  - Deduced criteria.
- **Information Types**:
  - Public: Proposals and which Verifiers are questioned.
  - Secret: Answers and personal notes.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- When one or more players claim to have found the code, they write it secretly on their note sheet.
- Each checks the SOLUTIONS section (booklet or app) to verify correctness.
- **Winning**:
  - The player who found the correct code with the **fewest questions** wins.
  - In case of a tie, all tied players win.
  - Incorrect players are eliminated. If only one player remains, they win by default.
- After the game, erase marks on the back of Verification cards.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Simultaneous Play**: All players compose proposals and question Verifiers at the same time.
- **Card Availability**: If a needed punch card is in use, wait until it’s free.
- **Verification Card Return**: Immediately return Verification cards to their correct Verifier after use.
- **Questions per Round**: Maximum of 3 Verifiers per round; fewer are allowed.
- **Proposal Consistency**: The same proposal must be used for all questions in a round.
- **No Redundant Criteria**: All Verifiers provide unique information; none repeat another’s criterion.
- **Single Valid Code**: Only one code satisfies all Verifier criteria.
