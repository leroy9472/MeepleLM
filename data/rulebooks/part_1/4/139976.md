### 1. Lore & Objective
Cthulhu Wars is a strategic board game where players control factions vying for dominance through occult power, territorial control, and summoning Great Old Ones. The ultimate goal is to accumulate the most Doom points (via controlled gates, rituals, and Elder Signs) while fulfilling faction-specific objectives, primarily collecting all six spellbooks. The game ends when a player reaches 30+ Doom points or the Ritual of Annihilation marker reaches the "Instant Death" space. Victory is awarded to the player with the most Doom who also possesses all six spellbooks.

### 2. Components
- Player faction cards, spellbooks, and unit figures (Cultists, Monsters, Great Old Ones)
- Gates, Elder Sign tokens, Doom Track, and Ritual of Annihilation Track
- Power and Doom markers
- Dice (D6s for combat)
- Special tokens (e.g., Desecration markers, Brain Cylinders, Slime Molds)
- Watcher Token (Yuggoth Map only)

### 3. Setup
- **Player Count & Boards**:  
  - 2–3 players: Use 3-player map sides.  
  - 4 players: Use one 3-player and one 5-player side.  
  - 5+ players: Use both 5-player sides (expansion required).  
- **Initial Setup**:  
  - Each player chooses a faction, takes matching figures, 6 spellbooks, and faction card.  
  - Place Doom marker at 0; Power marker at 8 on faction card.  
  - Set Ritual marker at 5 on the track matching player count.  
  - Shuffle Elder Sign tokens (face down) and place near the board.  
- **Starting Position**:  
  - Place a Gate and 6 Acolyte Cultists in the faction’s start area (marked by glyph).  
  - One Cultist must be on the Gate to control it.  
- **First Player**: Cthulhu is first player. If not in play, choose randomly. Windwalker cannot be first player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of four phases:

1. **Action Phase**:  
   Players take turns performing one action (common, unique, or spellbook) until all are out of power. Unlimited actions (e.g., Control Gate) can be taken freely per turn.  
2. **Gather Power Phase**:  
   All players simultaneously gain Power based on units, gates, and abilities. Power is adjusted to half the highest player’s total (rounded up) if below.  
3. **Determine First Player Phase**:  
   The player with the most Power becomes first player and chooses play order (clockwise or counterclockwise).  
4. **Doom Phase** (skipped on Turn 1):  
   - Advance Doom markers by number of controlled gates.  
   - Players may perform one Ritual of Annihilation (in turn order), spending Power equal to the Ritual marker.  
   - Advance Ritual marker; gain Doom per gate and 1 Elder Sign per controlled Great Old One.  
   - Game may end if Doom ≥30 or Ritual marker reaches "Instant Death".

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Power**: Used to perform actions. Gained from Cultists (+1), controlled Gates (+2), abandoned Gates (+1 per player), and sacrificed/captured Cultists (+1).  
- **Doom**: Victory points. Gained from controlled Gates (Doom Phase), Rituals, and Elder Sign values.  
- **Actions**:  
  - **Common**: Recruit Cultist (1), Summon Monster (varies), Awaken GOO (varies), Build Gate (3), Move (1 per unit), Battle (1), Capture Cultist (1).  
  - **Unlimited**: Control/Abandon Gate (0), Unlimited Battle (1, after 6 spellbooks).  
- **Combat**:  
  1. **Pre-Battle**: Attacker, then defender use abilities (e.g., Shriveling, Demand Sacrifice).  
  2. **Battle**: Roll dice equal to total Combat. 6 = Kill, 4–5 = Pain.  
  3. **Post-Battle**: Assign Kills (remove units), then Pains (retreat). Attacker applies Pains first.  
- **Spellbooks**: Factions earn abilities by meeting requirements. Once earned, they are permanent.  
- **Great Old Ones (GOOs)**: Powerful units with unique awakening conditions and combat rules.  
- **Elder Signs**: Awarded during Rituals. Each is worth 1–3 Doom points (revealed at any time).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: The player with the most Doom who has collected all 6 spellbooks wins.  
- **Game End Triggers**:  
  - A player’s Doom reaches 30+ (game ends at end of Doom phase or current turn).  
  - Ritual marker reaches "Instant Death" (after final Rituals).  
- **Tiebreaker**: If tied in Doom and all have 6 spellbooks, game is a draw.  
- **Humanity Wins**: If no player has 6 spellbooks when game ends, all lose.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Unlimited Battle**: Costs 1 Power and allows multiple battles per turn after earning 6 spellbooks. Only one battle per area per phase.  
- **Power Minimum**: If a player’s Power is less than half the leader’s, it is set to half (rounded up).  
- **Elder Sign Shortage**: If no Elder Signs remain, a Doom point is awarded instead.  
- **Watcher (Yuggoth Map)**:  
  - Awakens at 12 Doom or by die roll in Green Pyramid Areas.  
  - Attacks once per player, controlled in turn order.  
  - Killed if Doom Track reaches 0 after Decay roll.  
- **Two-Player Rules**:  
  - Decay Marker increases when a player cannot act.  
  - Eliminated units grant Doom equal to half their cost (rounded up) to the opponent.  
  - Unlimited Battle is shared between players.
