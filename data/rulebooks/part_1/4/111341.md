## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Each player represents an African kingdom striving for cultural dominance by erecting monuments and placing craftsmen. Victory is achieved when a player’s Victory Points (VP) meet or exceed their Victory Requirement (VR). The game ends immediately upon this condition.

2. Components

  - 1 VR disk  
- Shuffle VR disks; stack on “20” of VP track.  
- In order from top to bottom of VR stack, players place first monument on a starting area.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has four phases:  
1. The Generosity of Kings (Bidding for turn order)  
2. Religion and Culture (Main actions)  
3. Revenues (Income collection)  
4. Let Us Compare Mythologies (Victory check)  
Repeat until victory condition is met.

5. Core Mechanics  
**Victory Requirement (VR):**  
- Starts at 20. Increases when acquiring gods, specialists, or technology cards.  
- Cannot exceed 40; no action may raise VR above 40.  
- VP is scored via monuments and craftsmen.

**Phase I: The Generosity of Kings (Turn Order Auction)**  
- Clear turn-order track.  
- Order empire plaques by VR (highest first). Tiebreaker: owner of bottom VR disk places first.  
- Starting leftmost, players either:  
  - Bid more cattle than previous bid (min 1 to start), paid immediately  
  - Or pass, taking last available spot on turn-order track  
- Bid cattle distributed evenly across all plaques, cycling left to right, starting where last bid ended.  
- When all but one pass, players collect cattle from their plaques. Turn order is set.

**Phase II: Religion and Culture (Player Turn)**  
On your turn, you may:  
- Choose **1** god **or** 1 specialist (not both)  
- Use any number of your specialists (once each)  
- Take **one** of the following actions:  
  a) Build 1 (or 2 with Obatala) monument(s)  
  b) Place any number of craftsmen  
  c) Raise any number of monuments (max +1 level each)  

**Choosing God or Specialist:**  
- God: One per player, permanent. Adjust VR per card.  
- Specialist: May own multiple, one per turn. Must pay activation cost (placed on card) even if not used.  

**Specialists:**  
- **Shaman (VR+3):** Pay 2 cattle to place 1 resource tile (ivory, wood, clay, diamond) on empty land (not start area). Must place if paid.  
- **Rain Ceremony (VR+1):** Pay 3 cattle to place 1 water tile (2x1) on empty land. Must place if paid.  
- **Herd (VR+6):** Place 2/4/6 cattle to gain 1/2/3 cattle on card (collected in Phase III).  
- **Nomads (VR+1):** Ignore adjacency rule when building monument. May pay without building.  
- **Builder (VR+2):** For each craftsman built, place first 2 cattle of cost on Builder card (returned in Phase III).  

**Building a Monument:**  
- Place 1 level-1 monument on empty land (not water, resource, craftsman, start area, or adjacent to another monument).  
- Score 1 VP.  
- Obatala allows 2 monuments per action.

**Placing Craftsmen:**  
- Must own matching technology card (take if not owned, adjust VR).  
- Cannot take second card of a type you already own.  
- Place craftsman on empty land (not start area).  
- Primary craftsman: Must be within 3 steps (no hubs) of an unused resource not in range of another same-type craftsman.  
- Secondary craftsman:  
  - Requires corresponding primary craftsman already on board before turn starts.  
  - Must be within 3 steps (hubs allowed) of a primary craftsman.  
  - Must be within 3 steps (no hubs) of required resource.  
- Cannot build first primary and corresponding secondary of same type in same turn.  
- Pay cost to bank; score VP per laurels on tech card.  
- Set price (1–3 cattle) for new tech; may raise prices on existing tech (cannot lower, except via Dziva).  
- May take “Place Craftsmen” action just to raise prices.

**Raising Monuments:**  
- Raise any number of your monuments by +1 level (max 5).  
- Cost: Number of different ritual goods = monument level before upgrade.  
- Goods must be different (except Tsui-Goab).  
- Cannot use primary goods once secondary craftsman of that type exists.  
- Buy goods from craftsmen in hub range of monument:  
  - Pay price to tech card (Anansi pays 1 per good regardless of price).  
  - Use hub: Pay 1 cattle per hub use to bank (or Qamata card if active).  
- For secondary goods:  
  - Pay primary craftsman (within hub range of secondary) and deplete its resource.  
  - Pay secondary craftsman and deplete its resource.  
- Place used marker on depleted resource (Atete may place second marker).  

**Transportation Range & Hubs:**  
- Base range: 3 steps (orthogonal/diagonal). Water = 1 step regardless of size.  
- Hubs: Monuments act as relay points. Use to extend range to craftsmen (not resources).  
- Must use hub if path passes through it. Pay 1 cattle per hub use when raising monuments.  
- Eshu increases range to 6 during his player’s turn.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **VP Sources:**  
  - 1 VP per monument built  
  - 1–3 VP per craftsman placed (per tech card)  
  - Raising monuments: +2/4/6/8 VP for levels 2/3/4/5 (cumulative: 1/3/7/13/21)  
- **Phase III: Revenues**  
  - Collect all cattle from your cards (tech, specialists, gods).  
  - Gain 1 cattle per level of highest monument.  
  - Engai: +2 additional cattle.  
- **Phase IV: Victory Check**  
  - If any player’s VP ≥ VR, game ends.  
  - Winner: Player who exceeds VR by most.  
  - Tiebreakers:  
    1. Greatest overshoot  
    2. Highest total VP  
    3. Earlier turn order (Xango wins ties)  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you lower prices?** Only Dziva allows lowering prices, at start of turn.  
- **Can you use your own craftsman for free?** No, must pay to your own tech card.  
- **Can hubs be used to reach resources?** No. Hubs only extend range to craftsmen.  
- **Can you pass on placing a monument with Nomads?** Yes. Paying Nomads does not require building.  
- **Gu VR rebate:** When taking Gu, reduce VR by 1 per tech card previously acquired (net VR must still ≤ 40).  
- **Qamata:** Hub fees go to Qamata card; owner collects in Phase III.  
- **Anansi:** Pays 1 cattle per ritual good (primary and secondary), regardless of set price.  
- **Elegua:** May pay first 3 cattle of bid from common stock.  
- **Shadipinyi:** Add god plaque to front of bidding queue; owner collects cattle from it too.
