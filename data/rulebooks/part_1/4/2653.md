## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Players control explorers on the sinking island of Atlantis. The goal is to rescue as many of your explorers as possible by getting them to safe isles. The game ends when the volcano tile is revealed. The player with the highest total point value of rescued explorers wins.

2. **Components**  
- Terrain tiles (beach, forest, mountain) with green or red borders  
- Explorer tokens (numbered 1–6, 10 per player)  
- Boat tokens (2 per player)  
- Creature tokens: Sharks, Whales, Sea Serpents, Dolphins, Giant Squid (expansion)  
- Creature dice (red die: Sea Serpent, Shark, Whale, Dolphin, Empty Boat, Wild; blue "Dive" die variant)  
- Safe isles (4 corner islands)  

3. **Setup**  
- Place 5 Sea Serpent tokens on designated hexes.  
- Shuffle terrain tiles and place them face-up within the black-bordered area to form Atlantis.  
- Each player chooses a color, takes 10 Explorer tokens and 2 boats.  
  - 5 players: Remove one 1-point and one 3-point Explorer per player; Players 1 and 2 get only 1 boat each.  
  - 6 players: Remove one 1-, 2-, and 3-point Explorer per player; Players 1–4 get only 1 boat each.  
- Players take turns placing one Explorer on any unoccupied land tile. Once all are filled, place on occupied tiles (max 2 per tile). Values remain secret.  
- Players take turns placing one boat on any unoccupied sea space adjacent to a land tile.  

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
On your turn, in order:  
1. **Play a Tile (Optional)**  
   - Play one red-border tile from your hand at the start of your turn.  
   - Cannot play after moving.  
2. **Move (3 total actions)**  
   - Move any combination of your Explorers and/or boats totaling 3 movement points.  
   - Dry Explorers (on land or in boat):  
     - Move between adjacent land tiles.  
     - Move from land to adjacent boat or sea hex (1 move).  
     - Move between adjacent boats (1 move).  
   - Wet Explorers (Swimmers):  
     - Can move only 1 sea hex per turn.  
     - Jumping from land or boat into water counts as their entire move.  
     - Can board a boat in the same sea hex (1 move).  
   - Boats:  
     - Can move up to 3 sea hexes.  
     - Controlled by player with majority of Explorers aboard (tie = all control).  
     - Empty boats can be moved by any player.  
     - Only 1 boat per sea hex.  
   - Once an Explorer leaves the island (enters water or boat), they cannot return to land.  
3. **Remove a Terrain Tile**  
   - Remove one tile adjacent to at least one sea space.  
   - Priority: Beach > Forest > Mountain.  
   - Landlocked tiles (no sea adjacency) are removed only when no others of that terrain type remain.  
   - Flip tile to reveal back:  
     - Green border: Play immediately and discard.  
     - Red border: Take into hand (kept secret) for future use.  
   - Any Explorers on removed tile fall into the sea and become swimmers.  
4. **Roll Creature Die & Move**  
   - Roll the red die. Move the indicated creature or unoccupied boat.  
   - Creatures can share spaces.  
   - Movement stops when entering a space that triggers an effect.  
   - Options:  
     - Sea Serpent: Move 1 space. Destroys all swimmers and occupied boats in the space.  
     - Shark: Move 1–2 spaces. Eats all swimmers in the space.  
     - Whale: Move 1–3 spaces. Destroys occupied boats (passengers become swimmers).  
     - Dolphin: Move 0–2 spaces. Can protect one swimmer.  
     - Empty Boat: Move 1 space.  
     - Wild (Starfish): Move any creature or unoccupied boat.  
   - If you have no Explorers left, skip the Move phase but continue playing.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Tile Types**  
  - *Green-border (Immediate)*:  
    - Shark/Whale/Dolphin: Place token on revealed sea hex.  
    - Boat: Place boat; swimmers in same hex board (max 3).  
    - Whirlpool: Remove all tokens on this and adjacent sea hexes.  
    - Volcano: Game ends immediately.  
  - *Red-border (Hold)*:  
    - Played at start of your turn:  
      - Move one of your swimmers up to 3 spaces.  
      - Move one of your controlled boats up to 3 spaces.  
      - Move any Sea Serpent, Shark, or Whale/Giant Squid to any vacant sea space.  
    - Defensive (play out of turn):  
      - When a Shark moves into a space with your swimmer: discard tile to remove the Shark.  
      - When a Whale moves into a space with your occupied boat: discard tile to remove the Whale.  
- **Dolphins**  
  - Protect one swimmer from attacks.  
  - Swimmer can carry dolphin when moving (1 space only).  
  - Dolphin can move 0–2 spaces when rolled.  
  - Cannot protect against Sea Serpent.  
- **Giant Squid (Expansion)**  
  - Placed when Whale tile drawn and no Whale available, or replaces Whales entirely.  
  - Attacks:  
    - Whale in same space  
    - One passenger from occupied boat in same space  
    - One Explorer from adjacent land tile (not both)  
  - Movement stops after attack.  
  - Cannot enter space with manned boat unless attacking.  
- **Movement Rules**  
  - Moving from ship to ship: 1 move, not a sea space.  
  - Getting on/off boat: counts as 1 move.  
  - Swimmers cannot enter land except in landlocked center hex.  
  - Cannot move fewer than 3 actions? Yes — you may use fewer or none.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- Game ends immediately when the Volcano tile is revealed.  
- All Explorers still on the island or in water are lost.  
- Only Explorers on safe isles score.  
- Score: Sum of numbers on rescued Explorers.  
- Tiebreaker: Most number of Explorers on safe isles.  
- Variants:  
  - *To the Last!*: Game ends when all Explorers are off the board. Volcano = Whirlpool.  
  - *Atlantis Submerged!*: Game ends when all terrain tiles are removed.  
  - *All Equal!*: Winner has most Explorers on safe isles (ignore values).  

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- Can you play more than one tile per turn? No — only one red tile at start of turn.  
- Can you use a red tile after moving? No — must be before movement.  
- Can you move an empty boat with a "Move your Boat" tile? No — you must control it.  
- Can Dolphins protect against Sea Serpent? No.  
- Can a Whale destroy a boat with a Giant Squid present? Yes — Whale destroys boat; Giant Squid may then attack.  
- Can you move a swimmer onto a terrain tile? Only in the center hex if landlocked.  
- Do creature moves end when entering a protected swimmer’s space? No — only effect is avoided.  
- Can you use defensive tiles after falling from a boat? Yes — if Whale causes it.  
- Can multiple players control a boat? Yes — if tied in occupancy.
