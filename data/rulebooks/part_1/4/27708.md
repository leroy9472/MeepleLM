### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Initiative Phase
1. **Deal Cards**:
   - Turns 1–5: 6 cards per player.
   - Turns 7–8: 7 cards per player.
2. **Initiative Check**:
   - Draw cubes one at a time from the Political Capital Bag.
   - First player to have two of their color drawn wins Initiative.
   - All drawn cubes return to their owners' supplies.
   - Winner chooses who plays first in Activity Phases.

#### Activity Phases (x5)
Each player plays one card per phase. Options:

**A. Play a Card as an Event**
- Read and resolve event text.
- **Persistent Events** (Debate, Election Day, Prevention) are placed in designated areas.
- Others are removed from the game.
- **Losing Support**: Events that reduce support only remove existing cubes; opponent never gains support.

**B. Play a Card for Campaign Points (CP)**
- Spend CP on one of three actions:
  - **Campaigning in States**
  - **Advertising in Regions**
  - **Positioning on Issues**

##### Campaigning in States
- Add State Support in states within your candidate’s current region.
- **Cost**: 1 CP per cube added.
- **Opponent Carrying State (≥4 cubes) or Candidate Present?** → Must perform **Support Check** for each CP spent.
- **Support Check**: Draw a cube from the bag.
  - Your color: place cube (or remove opponent’s).
  - Opponent’s color: return to their supply; no effect.
- **Exemption**: If you have **Media Support** in the region, no Support Check needed.
- **Move Candidate**:
  - 1 CP per regional boundary crossed.
  - Alaska/Hawaii count as separate regions for movement.

##### Advertising in Regions
- Make one **Support Check** per CP.
- Success: place Media Support cube in any region (remove opponent’s first if present).
- **Effects**:
  - Exempts you from Support Checks when campaigning in that region.
  - Having more Media Support than opponent allows **Issue Shift** during Momentum Phase.

##### Positioning on Issues
- Add/Remove Issue Support cubes.
- **Cost**:
  - 1 CP for first cube on an issue.
  - 2 CP for each additional cube on the same issue in the same action.
- **Benefits**:
  - Leading an issue grants Momentum/Endorsements.
  - Some Events benefit issue leaders.

**C. Play Candidate Card**
- Spend 5 CP.
- Flip card to exhausted side.
- Can only be flipped back via specific Events.

**Rest Cubes**:
- Always collect rest cubes (if any) shown on card into your Rest Cube Zone.

**Triggering Events**:
- After opponent plays a card for CP, you may **trigger its Event** by spending 1 Momentum Marker.
- You do **not** gain rest cubes.

**Preempting Events**:
- When playing a card for CP, spend 2 Momentum Markers to **prevent opponent from triggering** the event.

#### Momentum Phase
1. **Momentum Decay**:
   - Discard half of current Momentum Markers (round down).
2. **Awards for Issue Support** (resolve bottom to top of Issue Track):
   - **3rd Place**: 1 Momentum Marker.
   - **2nd Place**: 1 Momentum Marker **or** 1 Endorsement Card.
   - **1st Place**: 1 Momentum Marker **and** 1 Endorsement Card.
   - When drawing Endorsement Card: place marker in indicated region (remove opponent’s first if present).
3. **Issue Support Decay**:
   - Remove 1 cube from each issue (if any present).
4. **Issue Shift**:
   - Player with more **Media Support** cubes on the board may swap two adjacent issue tiles.
   - If tied, no shift occurs.

#### Campaign Strategy Phase
1. **Play Cards to Strategy Stack**:
   - Turns 1–5: 1 card per player.
   - Turns 7–8: 2 cards per player.
   - “Gathering Momentum” cards **cannot** be played as Strategy Cards.
   - Discard any remaining hand cards.
