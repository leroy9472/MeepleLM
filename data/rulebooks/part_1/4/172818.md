### 5. Core Mechanics

  - Place goods at any time; must fill left to right; same goods stack  
  - Left number = VP per good at game end

  - Goods cannot be removed once placed  
- **Villager Types**:  
  - **Hammer**: Required for Build  
  - **Quill**: Required for Train  
  - **Explore**: Determines lantern output based on die roll  
  - **Special Villagers**:  
    - **Cave Cat**: Roll die when used; 1–2: fails, goes to exhausted  
    - **Metal Man**: Has own bed; cannot use cider/potions  
    - **Glogo**: Pay 1 fewer coin when building  
    - **Liquid Woman**: Lose 1 reputation when gained  
- **Reputation Track**:  
  - Starts at Torch  
  - Gain/lose reputation via Explore choices  
  - Affects endgame scoring  
- **Symbols on Cards**:  
  - Train to Ready: New villagers start ready  
  - Reroll: Reroll 1 die per symbol per encounter (must keep result)  
  - Gain Coin When Building: +1 coin after purchasing any building (not self)

  - Replenishing Goods: Restock at end of round  
  - Income: +1 coin per round  
  - VP Bonuses: For villagers, goods, buildings, empty caves, etc.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after 7 rounds. Players score:  

1. **Advancement Track**:  
   - VP = (number of goods in each slot) × (left number above slot)  
   - Example: 4 fruit in a slot worth 2 VP each = 8 VP  

2. **Buildings**:  
   - 1 VP per building: Houses, Key Houses, Star Houses, Outposts  
   - Includes starting house  
   - Excludes empty cave cards  

3. **Reputation**:  
   - **Rank Bonus**:  
     - 1st: 5 VP, 2nd: 3 VP, 3rd: 2 VP  
     - 2-player: Only 1st gets 3 VP  
   - **Ties**: Add applicable ranks’ VP, divide by number of tied players, round up  
     - Example: 2-way tie for 1st: (5 + 3) / 2 = 4 VP each  
     - 3-way tie for 2nd: (3 + 2 + 0) / 3 = 1.67 → 2 VP each  
   - **Position Bonus**: VP listed on track space (can be negative)  

4. **Card Bonuses**:  
   - VP from card effects (e.g., "2 VP per villager", "1 VP per empty cave")  
   - Goods for VP must be in supply or Advancement Track (not on buildings)  

5. **Other Modules (if used)**:  
   - **Desert & Underforest**: Quest tokens and supplies (1 VP per 2 unused supplies)  
   - **Groves**: Adjacency bonuses for potions (if building grants potions)  

**Total VP** = Advancement + Buildings + Reputation + Card Bonuses + Module Bonuses  

**Tiebreakers**:  
1. Most coins  
2. Most villagers  
3. Most buildings  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place goods on Advancement Track during another player’s turn?**  
  Yes, at any time.  
- **Can I use a potion and a cider on the same villager?**  
  Yes: potion moves injured → exhausted, cider moves exhausted → ready.  
- **Can a villager use two beds?**  
  No. A villager can only be moved once per bed type.  
- **Do I get income from a building that gives +1 income if I don’t harvest it?**  
  Yes. Income is automatic at end of round.  
- **Can I build an outpost without harvesting the cave first?**  
  Yes. Owning the cave card is sufficient.  
- **Can I refresh both House and Outpost rows in one turn?**  
  No. Only one refresh per turn.  
- **Do I get the labor cider if I’m first to labor but no cider is available?**  
  No. Only if cider is on the board.  
- **Can I exert a villager who fails an action (e.g., Cave Cat rolls 1–2)?**  
  No. Exertion is only during Explore action before final lantern count.
