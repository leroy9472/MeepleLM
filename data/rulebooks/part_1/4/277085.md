## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Love Letter, players are suitors vying for the affection of the princess. The goal is to win favor tokens by successfully delivering your love letter. A player wins the game by being the first to earn a set number of favor tokens (based on player count), or by winning a tiebreaker round if needed.

2. Components  
- 21 character cards (quantities and values as below):  
  • Guard (1) – 6 copies  
  • Priest (2) – 2 copies  
  • Baron (3) – 2 copies  
  • Handmaid (4) – 2 copies  
  • Prince (5) – 2 copies  
  • Chancellor (6) – 2 copies  
  • King (7) – 1 copy  
  • Countess (8) – 1 copy  
  • Princess (9) – 1 copy  
- Favor tokens (used to track round wins)  
- Setup varies by player count.

3. Setup  
- For 2–4 players: Shuffle the full deck of 21 cards.  
- Deal 1 card to each player.  
- Remove the top card of the remaining deck face-down (set aside unseen).  
- Special 2-player setup: Remove 1 Guard, 2 Chancellor cards, and 2 Spy cards before shuffling (total of 16 cards used). Then deal 1 card to each player and reveal 3 additional cards face-up (set aside).  
- The winner of the previous round starts the next one. For the first round, any agreed player begins.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- On your turn:  
  1. Draw 1 card from the deck, so you hold 2 cards.  
  2. Play 1 of your 2 cards by revealing it and resolving its effect.  
- Played and discarded cards are placed face-up in front of players.  
- Play proceeds clockwise.  
- A player is eliminated during a round if:  
  • They are forced to discard their last card (e.g., via Guard, Baron, etc.).  
  • They play or discard the Princess (9).  
  • They are targeted by certain card effects and fail.  
- The round ends immediately when:  
  • The deck runs out after a turn. Remaining players reveal their cards; highest value wins. Ties result in all tied players winning the round.  
  • All but one player are eliminated. The last player standing wins.  
- The winner of the round receives 1 favor token and starts the next round.

5. Core Mechanics  
Card Effects (by value):  
- 0. Spy (2x): If no other player played or discarded a Spy this round, gain 1 favor token upon winning the round. If you are the only Spy player and lose, you still gain 1 favor token. Only 1 favor token maximum per round from Spies, even if two are played.  
- 1. Guard (6x): Name a card (2–8). Choose another active player. If they are holding that card, they are eliminated.  
- 2. Priest (2x): Look at another player’s hand.  
- 3. Baron (2x): Compare hands with another player. The player with the lower value is eliminated. If tied, no one is eliminated.  
- 4. Handmaid (2x): You are immune to the effects of other players’ cards until your next turn.  
- 5. Prince (2x): Choose any player (including yourself). That player discards their hand. If the discarded card was the Princess, they are eliminated. If the deck is empty, they draw the set-aside card instead.  
- 6. Chancellor (2x): Draw the top 2 cards of the deck, then return any 2 cards from your hand to the bottom of the deck in any order. If fewer than 2 cards remain in the deck, draw what is available and return 2 cards. If the deck is empty, Chancellor has no effect.  
- 7. King (1x): Trade hands with another player.  
- 8. Countess (1x): Must be discarded if you hold the King or Prince. May be played normally otherwise.  
- 9. Princess (1x): If you play or discard this card, you are immediately eliminated.

Special Rules:  
- If all remaining players are protected by Handmaid, cards that target (Guard, Priest, Baron, King) have no effect.  
- Prince targeting self: allowed. If your hand is discarded and it’s the Princess, you are eliminated.  
- If a player is eliminated, they discard their hand face-up and take no further actions until the round ends.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The number of favor tokens needed to win depends on player count:  
  • 2 players: 7 tokens  
  • 3 players: 5 tokens  
  • 4 players: 4 tokens  
- If a round ends in a tie for highest card, all tied players receive 1 favor token.  
- If players tie for the win condition, they may either share victory or play a single tiebreaker round.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I play the Countess even if I have the King or Prince?  
  A: No. If you hold the King or Prince, you must discard the Countess immediately (on your turn or when drawn).  
- Q: What happens if the deck is empty when playing Chancellor?  
  A: Chancellor has no effect.  
- Q: Can I target myself with Prince?  
  A: Yes. If you discard your own hand and it’s the Princess, you are eliminated.  
- Q: What if the only remaining player played a Spy and wins?  
  A: They gain 1 favor token for winning. If they are the only player who played a Spy, they gain a second favor token (total 2). If they lose, they still gain 1 favor token.  
- Q: Can I play a card that has no valid target?  
  A: Yes, but it has no effect (e.g., playing Guard when all others are protected by Handmaid).  
- Q: What happens if the set-aside card is the Princess?  
  A: It remains hidden. If a Prince forces a player to draw it, and it’s the Princess, that player is eliminated.
