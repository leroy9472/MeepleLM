#### 1. Exploration Phase  

**A. Draft Cards**  
- All players simultaneously choose cards to play:  
  - **2-player game**:  
    - Draw 1 card from Reserve into hand.  
    - Choose 1 card to play, 1 to discard (face-down).  
    - Pass remaining cards to opponent (face-down).  
  - **3–4 player games**:  
    - Choose 2 cards to play (place face-down in front of you).  
    - Pass remaining cards to neighbor:  
      - Round 1 & 3: Pass left  
      - Round 2 & 4: Pass right  

**B. Play Cards**  
Simultaneously reveal and resolve the 1 or 2 drafted cards:  
- **Parchment Card**:  
  - Place face-down in front of you.  
  - Keep secret until end of game.  
  - Number of Parchments held is public.  
- **Territory Card**:  
  - Place one of your Rabbits on the matching board space.  
  - You now control that Territory.  
  - Discard the card to your personal discard pile.  
  - **Special**:  
    - If occupied by opponent’s Camp: Remove their Rabbit and Camp. Take control.  
    - If occupied by your Camp: Remove Camp token (now eligible for other Buildings).  
- **Building Card**:  
  - Place card face-up in front of you.  
  - Place corresponding Building token (Farm, Sky Tower, Camp) or City on it.  
  - Will be placed on board in Construction Phase.  
- **Provisions Card**:  
  - Immediately draw 2 cards from the deck and play them as if drafted.  
  - Discard Provisions card.  

Repeat Draft and Play steps until all cards are played. Then proceed to Construction Phase.

#### 2. Construction Phase  
Players may place any or all of their Buildings from in front of them onto the board.  

**Rules for Placement**:  
- Buildings can only be placed on **Territories you control** (Rabbit present).  
- **Exception**: Camps can only be placed on **empty Territories** (no Rabbit, no Building).  
- Must respect **Building Requirements** (symbol in top-left of card):  
  - Forest: Farm/City must go on Forest  
  - Sea: Farm/City must go on Sea  
  - Field: Farm must go on Field  
  - Mountain: Strength 3 City or Luxury Farm only  
- **Only one Building per Territory** (no stacking).  
- Once placed, Buildings **cannot be moved or removed** (except Camps, which can be displaced).  
- If placing a Building on a Territory that already produces a Resource (e.g., Forest → Wood), it **retains that Resource** in addition to the Building’s effect.  

**Building Effects**:  
- **City (Strength 1/2/3)**: Increases **Strength** of its Fief by 1/2/3.  
- **Farm**:  
  - Basic Farm: Produces Wood, Fish, or Carrots.  
  - Trading Post: Choose one basic resource per round.  
  - Luxury Farm (e.g., Mushrooms, Gold): Produces unique Resource.  
  - Increases **Wealth** of Fief by adding a new Resource type.  
- **Sky Tower**:  
  - Place one token in each of two different Fiefs.  
  - Connects the Fiefs into one (as if adjacent).  
  - Tokens must be placed on Territories you control and eligible for Buildings.  
- **Camp**:  
  - Place token on **empty Territory**.  
  - Place one of your Rabbits to claim control.  
  - **Priority system**:  
    - Camps have numbers (1–6).  
    - When placing, announce priority number (not location).  
    - Any player with a lower-numbered Camp may interrupt and place theirs first.  
    - After all lower-priority Camps are placed or passed, you may place yours or save it.  
  - If a player plays a Territory card matching your Camp:  
    - Remove Camp and your Rabbit.  
    - They place their Rabbit and take control.  
    - You may now place a Building on that space.

#### 3. Harvest Phase  
All players simultaneously score Golden Carrots from their Fiefs.

**Fief Definition**:  
- A Fief is one or more **orthogonally connected** Territories (up/down/left/right) under your control.  
- Connected via shared edges **not separated by a Lava Flow**.  
- **Sky Towers** connect two Territories in different Fiefs, merging them into one.  
- A Fief can be a single Territory.

**Scoring Formula**:  
> Golden Carrots = **Strength × Wealth**

- **Strength**: Total number of **Towers** in all Cities within the Fief.  
  - Strength 1 City = 1 Tower  
  - Strength 2 City = 2 Towers  
  - Strength 3 City = 3 Towers  
- **Wealth**: Number of **different Resources** produced by the Fief.  
  - Count each Resource type only once, even if produced multiple times.  
  - Includes:  
    - Basic Resources (Wood, Fish, Carrots) from Territories  
    - Resources from Farms (Basic, Trading Post, Luxury)  
  - Example: 2 Forests (Wood) + 1 Mushroom Farm = Wealth 2 (Wood, Mushrooms)  

**Important**: A Fief only scores if it has **at least one City (Strength ≥1)** and **at least one Resource (Wealth ≥1)**.

**Scoring Process**:  
- Calculate score for each Fief.  
- Add all Fief scores.  
- Move your Rabbit forward on the Score Track.  
- If passing 100 or 200, use second Rabbit or move to +100/+200 space.  

After scoring, if it’s **Round 4**, proceed to Final Scoring. Otherwise, deal new cards and start next Round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Drafting**: Simultaneous card selection and passing (left/right alternates).  
- **Area Control**: Use Rabbits to claim Territories and form Fiefs.  
- **Resource Production**: Fiefs generate Resources based on terrain and Farms.  
- **Fief Merging**: Use Sky Towers to connect distant Fiefs.  
- **Camp Mechanic**: Temporary control with priority-based placement.  
- **Trading Posts**: Choose resource each round; choice is fixed for final scoring.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After Round 4 Harvest:  

**Reveal Parchment Cards**:  
- **Treasures (Ⓞ)**: Score fixed Golden Carrots as shown.  
- **Missions**: Score only if conditions are met. Examples:  
  - “Carpenter”: 1 point per Wood produced (counts all Wood, even duplicates)  
  - “King of Thieves”: Score based on opponent’s Parchments  
  - “PanPan the Barbarian”: Score for Plains/Mountains with no Resource and no City  

**Special Rules for Parchments**:  
- **Scoring Resources**: Missions count **all instances** of a Resource (not just unique per Fief).  
- **Scoring Cities**: Count number of Cities (Strength irrelevant).  
- **Scoring Fiefs**: Count number of Fiefs or size (Territories). Sky Towers and Camps count.  
- **Trading Post Rule**: Must use **same resource choice** from Round 4 for all Parchment scoring.  
- **Gloves**: 1 point if one Glove, 8 points total (4 each) if both.  
- **Little Prince**: If multiple Fiefs tied for highest score, re-score all but one.  
- **Liberal/Socialist**: Copy another player’s Parchment card (including Treasures and bonuses).  

**Final Score**:  
- Add all Golden Carrots from:  
  - 4 Harvest Phases  
  - Parchment Cards (Treasures and Missions)  
- Player with highest total wins.  
- **Tie**: Players share victory.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a Territory produce two Resources?**  
  Yes: e.g., Forest (Wood) + Mushroom Farm = Wood and Mushrooms.  
- **Can I place a Building on a Territory with a Camp?**  
  No—Camps are Buildings. Remove Camp first by playing the Territory card.  
- **Do Camps count toward Fief size for Missions?**  
  Yes—Territories with Camps are part of your Fief.  
- **Can Sky Towers connect Fiefs across Lava Flows?**  
  Yes—Sky Towers ignore terrain barriers.  
- **What happens to unused Buildings?**  
  Keep them in front of you; can place in future rounds.  
- **Can I play a Provisions card and get a Building?**  
  Yes—drawn cards can be any type, including Buildings.  
- **Can I place a Strength 3 City on a non-Mountain?**  
  No—only Mountains.  
- **Can I have more than one Fief?**  
  Yes—common in early game.
