## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *The Guild of Merchant Explorers*, players are adventurers answering the Queen’s call to explore the kingdom of Tigomé. The realm’s maps are outdated, and its cities have lost contact. Players explore diverse terrains—grasslands, deserts, mountains, and seas—across four provinces: Avenida, Aghon, Kazan, and Cnidaria.

**Objective**: Earn the most coins (Ⓞ) by discovering villages, establishing trade routes, visiting discovery towers, exploring ruins for treasure, and completing goal cards. The player with the most coins at the end of Era IV wins.

Special modes include:
- **Solo Campaign Mode**: Play 8 linked games across maps, aiming to become the greatest explorer.
- **Story Mode**: A narrative-driven solo adventure across 8 chapters with evolving scenarios, win conditions, and difficulty levels.

### 3. Setup
**Standard Game (1–4 players)**:
1. Each player takes:
   - A matching map (e.g., Avenida)
   - One set of 13 village tokens and 36 explorer cubes
   - Return unused maps and sets to the box.
2. Place the **Exploration Board** in the center.
3. Place era cards "II", "III", and "I/II/III" on their designated spots.
4. Shuffle the "I" era card with the 5 basic explore cards to form the **Exploration Deck**.
5. Shuffle the **Investigate Deck** and **Treasure Deck** separately.
6. Place discovery towers, trading posts, treasure tokens, and coins in a shared supply.
7. Select 6 goal cards matching the map; shuffle and reveal 3 face-up beneath the Exploration Board.

**Solo Mode Setup**:
- Set up as above.
- Arrange the 5 solo era tokens below the 3 goal cards:
  - "II" → left space of first goal
  - "III" → right space of first goal, left space of second goal
  - "I/II/III" → right space of second goal, left space of third goal
- Complete all 3 goals and reach a coin threshold (Easy: 90, Normal: 120, Hard: 150) to win.

**The Capital’s Guilds Expansion Setup**:
- Remove treasure cards from play.
- Randomly select or choose 3 guild tracks; place them centrally.
- Each player places 1 diplomat (explorer cube) at the bottom of any track.
- Shuffle the expansion’s goal card with the 6 map-specific goal cards; deal 3 face-up.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts **4 eras**. Each era proceeds as follows:

#### A. Era Preparation
- **Era I**: Exploration Deck = 5 basic + "I" era card
- **Era II**: Shuffle in "II" card
- **Era III**: Shuffle in "III" card
- **Era IV**: Shuffle in all era cards (including "I/II/III")
- Remove all explorers from maps (keep villages, towers, posts, tokens).

#### B. Turn Sequence
1. Reveal top card from Exploration Deck.
2. All players simultaneously:
   - Perform the explore action on their map.
   - Resolve map features immediately upon meeting conditions.
3. Repeat until deck is empty.

#### C. Investigate Cards
- When an **era card** is revealed for the first time:
  - Draw 2 investigate cards, choose 1, discard the other.
  - Place chosen card in the corresponding era slot on your map.
  - Perform its action.
- In later eras, reuse your saved investigate card when its era is drawn.
- In **Era IV**, when "I/II/III" is drawn, reuse any one of your three investigate cards (used twice this era).

#### D. Golden Rules of Exploration
1. Place each explorer adjacent to your capital, village, or another explorer. Target space must be empty.
2. Place explorers **one at a time**.
3. Resolve map features (e.g., village discovery) **immediately** upon completion, then finish placing explorers.
4. Unless specified, new explorers may be placed adjacent to **any** of your villages or explorers.
5. You may place **fewer** explorers than shown, but cannot save actions for later.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Map Features
- **Blank Spaces**: Discover villages when a region is fully explored. Reward based on era and map.
- **Coin Spaces**: Earn coins shown when explored.
- **Ruin Spaces**: First exploration earns a treasure card (base game) or advances a diplomat on a guild track (expansion). Mark with treasure token.
- **City Spaces (2–5)**: Connect two cities with unbroken chain of explorers, villages, or capital → multiply values → earn coins → place trading post on one city. City is then blocked for future trade routes.
- **Discovery Spaces**: Explore → remove explorer → place discovery tower → earn coins based on number of towers built.
- **Crystal Spaces (Cnidaria only)**: Wild terrain. When explored, place crystal token and earn coins equal to total crystals explored (this and past eras).

#### Villages & Regions
- A **region** is a contiguous group of same-terrain spaces.
- Fully explore all spaces in a region (including cities) → replace one explorer on a **blank space** with a village → earn coins.
- Only one village per region.
- Capital acts as a village for exploration but **not** for scoring or goals.

#### Goal Cards
- When you meet goal requirements, place an explorer on the card.
- **First completion**: earn higher reward.
- **Subsequent completions**: earn lower reward.
- In solo mode, **all 3 goals must be completed** to win (even if blocked by tokens).

#### Special Map Rules
- **Avenida**: "Land" = area isolated by sea or map edge.
- **Aghon**: No special rules.
- **Kazan**: Cannot explore volcanoes; some mountain regions lack blank spaces (no villages); ruin spaces are lettered for goals.
- **Cnidaria**: Cannot explore jagged reef spaces; ruin spaces have symbols (△, O, ▢); crystal spaces award cumulative coins.

#### The Capital’s Guilds Expansion
- Exploring a ruin for the first time → advance one of your **diplomats** on a chosen guild track → gain benefit.
- Benefits include:
  - Extra exploration actions
  - Coin bonuses
  - Extra diplomats
  - Special abilities (e.g., use any explore card, force opponents to pay)
- Diplomats can be reset by paying 1 coin.
- Top space of any track: **Guildmaster** (10 points)
- **Master Explorer**: Have ≤7 explorer cubes left (5 points)

    - > 150: add 2× surplus (e.g., 160 → 180)
- **Mode #02/#03 (Loss Conditions)**:
  - Fail a goal or score < threshold → cannot proceed.
  - One retry allowed; second failure → campaign lost.
  - Thresholds: 90 (Easy) to 150 (Master)

**Story Mode (S01)**
- 8 chapters with narrative, special rules, and evolving win conditions.
- Example: Chapter 2 adds "ice cubes" blocking sea spaces.
- Chapter 3–4: Replace treasure deck with Ruin Space Exploration Board (immediate rewards).
- Chapter 5–6: Explore from capital **or** explored ruin spaces (cubes remain).
- Chapter 6: Place 7 crystal tokens on volcano to "find the Queen".

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I explore from a village discovered this turn?**  
  Yes, as long as it was placed before the next explorer is placed.

- **Can I complete multiple trade routes in one turn?**  
  Yes. If a single explorer connects three cities at once, resolve one route at a time.

- **Do I earn from coin spaces every era?**  
  Yes. Coin spaces can be re-explored each era for full value.

- **Can I use an investigate card not matching the current era in Era IV?**  
  No. When "I/II/III" is drawn, you may reuse any of your three saved investigate cards (once each, one used twice).

- **In The Capital’s Guilds, can I have multiple diplomats on the same track?**  
  Yes. You may advance any of your diplomats when exploring a ruin.

- **In Story Mode Chapter 4, what if I miss a discovery tower?**  
  You lose points. You must explore **at least 3 of 4 towers** to win.

- **In Chapter 6, do crystal tokens go on the map or supply?**  
  Place them on designated volcano spaces in the eastern island. 7 total required to win.

- **Can I complete a goal after it's blocked by a solo token?**  
  Yes, but you earn **0 coins**. You must still complete it in solo mode to win.
