## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the Heian era, two siblings—children of a renowned onmyō master—compete to prove their spiritual mastery. Each commands a master and students, using spirit techniques to either capture the opponent’s master or infiltrate their temple arch. Victory is achieved by either:  
- Capturing the opponent’s master (Way of the Stone), or  
- Moving your master to the opponent’s master starting space (Way of the Stream).

2. Components  
- 1 game board (5×5 grid)  
- 2 master pawns (onmyō)  
- 8 student pawns (4 per player)  
- 15 spirit/move cards (including dual-use cards like Tiger, Frog, etc.)  
- Optional: Wind Spirit pawn and Wind Spirit cards (from Way of the Wind expansion)  
- Optional: Ninja mats, screens, ninjas, lanterns (from Light and Shadow expansion)  
- 14 additional move cards (from Forgotten Moves fan expansion; Whale and Owl require Way of the Wind)

3. Setup  
Base Game:  
- Place the board between players. Each player sits at opposite ends.  
- Place each master pawn on the center space of their back row. Fill remaining back-row spaces with 4 student pawns.  
- Shuffle all spirit cards. Deal 2 face-up cards to each player.  
- Place one additional card face-up to the right of the board, facing the first player.  
- Remaining 10 cards are set aside.  

With Way of the Wind:  
- Place Wind Spirit pawn on center space.  
- Randomly select 2 Wind Spirit cards (0–5 may be used).  
- Each player receives a random half (rounded down) of selected Wind Spirit cards.  
- The extra card (or remaining Wind Spirit card if odd count) is placed beside the board.

With Light and Shadow (Way of the Light or Shadow):  
- Light Master (LM): Receives 1 master, 4 students, 2 lanterns.  
- Shadow Master (SM): Receives 1 master, 2 students (placed in back corners), 1 ninja mat, 1 screen, 1 ninja (secretly placed left or right of temple arch on ninja mat), 2 lanterns.  
- LM (if playing Way of the Light: Light Master variant): Receives 2 ninjas, places them secretly on back row of ninja mat.  
- Place 1 random move card (or remaining Wind Spirit card) beside the board.  
- First player determined by card stamp (if present) or Light Master goes first.

7 Card Variant (3 cards per player):  
- Print player mats.  
- Deal 3 cards per player:  
  - 1st card → Master Card (placed under Master Card column; usable only by master).  
  - Cards 2–3 → Student Cards (usable by master or students).  
- Place one card to the side of the board (replacement card).  
- When a card is played:  
  - Replace it with the card from the side.  
  - New card goes into the same column (Master or Student).  
- Optional 9-card variant: 2 Master cards (master-only), 2 Student cards (student-only), 1 shared card.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn:  
1. Choose one of your two (or more) face-up cards.  
2. Select a pawn that can legally use the move (as shown on the card’s black space).  
   - Dual cards (e.g., Frog, Tiger): Move differs for master vs. student.  
   - Wind Spirit cards: Top move for chosen pawn; bottom move for Wind Spirit.  
3. Move the selected pawn to a highlighted destination space:  
   - Must be empty or occupied by an enemy pawn.  
   - Cannot move off the board or onto a friendly pawn.  
4. If landing on an enemy pawn:  
   - Remove the enemy pawn from the game.  
   - If enemy master is captured → win (Way of the Stone).  
5. If moving your master to opponent’s starting master space → win (Way of the Stream).  
6. (Wind Spirit cards only): Move the Wind Spirit according to the bottom move.  
   - If Wind Spirit lands on an enemy student → student teleports to Wind Spirit’s prior space.  
   - Wind Spirit cannot land on enemy master; masters/students cannot land on Wind Spirit.  
7. Place used card to the left of the board, rotated 180° (facing opponent).  
8. Take the card from the right side of the board and place it in front of you (now you have 2 cards again).  

With Light and Shadow:  
- You may secretly move your ninja using the same card (different option allowed).  
- If ninja lands on opponent’s ninja → capture; opponent must reveal.  
- Capturing both enemy ninjas → win (for Light Master variant).  
- After moving, optionally spend 1 lantern to illuminate a row/column. Opponent reveals only whether their ninja is in that line.

With Knowledge Variant:  
- When a student is captured, the losing player draws a card and places it to the right of the board (with the card passed from opponent).  
- When replacing a used card, the player may choose from all cards now in their right-side stack (2 after first loss, 3 after second, etc.).  
- However, only 2 cards are ever active in front of the player at a time.

Simultaneous Play Variant:  
- Draw 6 cards. Each player takes 2; 1 card placed on each side of the board.  
- Each turn, players simultaneously write:  
  - Which card they use (left or right)  
  - Which piece moves (marked by dot)  
  - Destination (marked by ×)  
- Resolve moves simultaneously:  
  1. Both move to empty spaces → both move.  
  2. One moves to enemy’s occupied space → enemy eliminated.  
  3. Both move to same space → both eliminated.  
- Cannot use the same card twice in a row.  
- Game may end in a draw.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Turn-based or simultaneous play.  
- Card-driven movement: Each card shows movement pattern (relative directions).  
- Dual-use cards: Different moves for master vs. student (e.g., Frog/Ostrich).  
- Card rotation: After use, card is passed to opponent (rotated), enabling dynamic strategy.  
- Replacement: Card from side replaces used card; maintains balance.  
- Conditional moves (Forgotten Moves expansion):  
  - White cross on black square → only to empty space.  
  - Black cross on white square → only to capture opponent.  
- Wind Spirit movement: Affects both players; can teleport students.  
- Ninja stealth movement: Hidden units; revelation only on capture or illumination.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends immediately when:  
  - A player’s master is captured → opponent wins (Way of the Stone).  
  - A player moves their master to opponent’s original master space → that player wins (Way of the Stream).  
  - (Light and Shadow) Light Master captures both enemy ninjas → win.  
- No scoring system; first win condition achieved ends the game.  
- In Simultaneous variant: Possible draw if both players are eliminated or no legal moves.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I use a card I can’t legally play?  
  A: Only if both cards are unusable. Then you must pass: choose a card, discard it left, take the right card. No pawn moves.  

- Q: What if my only legal move uses my ninja (in Light and Shadow)?  
  A: You may use it or pass. If you use it, you may also move your visible pawn if possible.  

- Q: Can the Wind Spirit capture the master?  
  A: No. Wind Spirit cannot move onto enemy master.  

- Q: Can two pawns swap via Turtle or similar?  
  A: No. Movement is teleport-like; no adjacency or path required, but cannot land on friendly.  

- Q: How are dual cards used with Wind Spirit?  
  A: Wind Spirit follows the student move. Master moves are exclusive to masters.  

- Q: Can I move my ninja onto the main board?  
  A: Yes. If you do, and it lands on opponent’s ninja, they must reveal the capture.  

- Q: What happens if both players play to the same space simultaneously?  
  A: Both pawns are eliminated (Simultaneous variant).
