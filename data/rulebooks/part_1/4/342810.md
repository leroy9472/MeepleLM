### 1. Lore & Objective  
**Objective**: Score the most Victory Points (VPs) over 3 Seasons by strategically deploying Keshis, activating Assistants, and optimizing end-game scoring across sectors.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### 1. Keshi Selection & Assistant Deployment  
- **Solo Player**:  
  - Secretly selects 3 Keshis from behind screen  
  - Deploys 1 Assistant to each matching sector (Red = wild, any sector)  
- **AI**:  
  - Randomly draws 6 Keshis from bag  
  - Deploys 1 Assistant per drawn color to corresponding sector  
    - Market (Souk): Max 3 Assistants per turn  
      - [Variant: Max 1 or 2 Assistants in Market]  
    - Red Keshi: Deploy Assistant to AI’s sector with most Keshis  
      - Tiebreak: Brown > Grey > Blue > Green > Beige > White > Market > Black > Pink  
- All 9 Keshis (3 player + 6 AI) dropped into Cube Tower  
- Arrange Keshis by color in base (Brown > Blue > Orange > ... > Green > Black > Pink)  

#### 2. Keshi Draft/Deployment (Turn Order: Player First)  
- Each player takes up to 2 Keshis of one color from base, deploying immediately  
- AI Drafts:  
  - Up to 2 Keshis if possible, else 1  
  - Chooses color in left-to-right, top-down order on Cube Tower base  
    - Brown > Blue > Orange > ... > Green > Black > Pink  
  - Cannot draft color if sector is full (including Red)  
- AI Deployment Rules:  
  - **Red**: Deploy to sector with most AI Keshis  
    - Tiebreak: Sector order above  
  - **Brown**: Deploy in order:  
    2VP → 2 Resources → Black path 1st Oasis → White path 1st Oasis → ... → Final Oases  
    - Flip Oasis tile per base rules  
  - **Pink**: Deploy in preference order:  
    1. 2VP  
    2. River Bump  
    3. Palace/Mosque Bump  
    4. Gain Purple/Orange/Yellow Keshi  
    - Other Pink spaces used only for district completion (10VP)  
    - [Variant: Treat water space as River Bump for difficulty increase]  
  - **All other colors**: Follow base game deployment rules and bonuses  

#### 3. Assistant Activation (AI)  
AI activates Assistants in sector order:  
**Brown > Grey > Blue > Beige > White > Market > Black > Pink**  
- [Variant: Activate from sector with most Keshis to least; tiebreak by above order]  
- If no Keshi in sector, AI gains 1 Keshi + deployment bonus  

**AI-Specific Activation Rules**:  
- **Brown (Sahara)**:  
  - Deploy Brown Keshi per Brown deployment order

  - Score 2VP per color match (base rules)  
- **Grey (Madrasa)**:  
  - Purchasing power = number of Grey Keshis deployed  
  - Buys as many Scrolls as possible  
  - Scroll selection order:  
    1. Most Scholars required (7 → 5 → 3), left to right  
    2. Ongoing Ability Tiles (∞) – not used  
    3. Lowest stack height
