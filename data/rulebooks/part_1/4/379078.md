# Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the aftermath of Rasputin and Fenris’s fall, peace returns to Europa—until a meteorite crashes in Siberia, awakening ancient corruption. Expeditions are launched to investigate, but rescue teams vanish. Now, heroes fund their own journeys into the taiga, seeking artifacts, glory, and answers. In Expeditions, players lead private expeditions to explore the corrupted lands, vanquish corruption, and complete objectives to earn the most wealth and prestige. The goal is to score the most coins by the end of the game through strategic exploration, card play, and completing glory categories.

3. Setup  
PLAYER COMPONENTS:  
- Randomly assign a mech mat and matching miniature. Attach a base snap to indicate player color.  
- Draw one character card at random, then take its matching companion card (same number in upper right). Place both face up to the left of your mech mat (your hand).  
- Place your 4 glory tokens on your mech mat.  
- Place your action token on the Refresh spot.  
- Place power and guile tokens on the 0 spot of their respective tracks.  
- Take 2 player aids (one of each type).  

SHARED COMPONENTS:  
- Place Basecamp board on the table; place each player’s mech beside it.  
- Separate location tiles by region (South, Central, North).  
  - Shuffle 6 South tiles and place them face up in the designated spots.  
  - Shuffle 7 Central and 7 North tiles separately; place them face down in their designated spots.  
- Place 1 map token on each face-down (Central and North) location.  
- Shuffle all meteorite, item, and quest cards into one deck.  
  - Place 5 cards face up in the spaces among the locations.  
  - Place the deck face down nearby; form a sweep pile next to it.  
- Place workers, coins, and extra map tokens in the general supply.  
- Fill the corruption bag with all corruption tokens except the 20-value token.  
- Randomly determine the first player.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Turns proceed clockwise.  
- On your turn:  
  1. Shift your action token:  
     - If on Refresh, move it to the blank spot and take Move, Play, and Gather in any order.  
     - If on Move, Play, or Gather, shift it to cover one of the other two actions and take the two exposed actions (in any order), or choose to Refresh.  
  2. If you choose Refresh:  
     - Return all workers from active cards to your mech mat.  
     - Return all active cards to your hand.  
     - Shift action token to Refresh spot.  
     - On your next turn, you must take all three actions.  
- After your turn, play passes to the left.  

5. Core Mechanics  
MOVE:  
- Move your mech to an unoccupied location within range (1–3 locations).  
- Basecamp is adjacent to 3 southern locations; you cannot return to Basecamp after leaving.  
- You may pass through occupied locations but cannot end there.  
- If moving to a face-down location:  
  1. Gain the map token.  
  2. Flip the tile face up.  
  3. Draw corruption tokens from the bag and stack them until their total value meets or exceeds the location’s corruption level (shown on tile).  
     - Exception: If the location is #20, place the 20-value corruption token instead.  
     - If the bag is empty, stop drawing.  

PLAY:  
- Play 1 card from your hand to the right of your active row.  
- In any order:  
  a) Gain the core value (power and/or guile; max 10 each).  
  b) Place a matching worker on the card to activate its ability.  
- Item cards may have instant and ongoing benefits.  
- Cards remain active until refreshed.  

GATHER:  
- Gain all exposed benefits at your current location. Icons represent separate benefits.  
- If a “/” symbol, choose one side only.  
- Benefits include:  
  - Gain a worker (max 10 per color).  
  - Gain a face-up card (replace immediately from deck).  
  - Draw 2, gain 1, place other in sweep pile (shuffle sweep pile if deck runs out).  
  - Sweep: take any number of face-up cards, place in sweep pile, replace from deck.  
  - Gain 1 benefit from an adjacent location.  
  - Activate an adjacent face-up card’s ability (no worker needed; ongoing lasts only this turn).  
  - Play 1 card from hand.  
  - Refresh cards and workers (do not shift action token).  
  - Rescue 1 active card to hand (return worker if present).  
  - Gain a map token (from supply).  
  - Upgrade, Meld, or Boast (only after removing all corruption).  

UPGRADE:  
- Tuck an item card under the right edge of your mech mat (only ongoing ability applies).  
- Return any worker on it.  
- Max 4 upgraded items.  

MELD:  
- Tuck a meteorite card sideways under the bottom edge of your mech mat.  
- Immediately gain meld bonuses from all melded meteorites.  
- Return any worker on it.  
- Max 4 melded meteorites.  

BOAST:  
- Place one of your glory tokens on a Basecamp glory category if:  
  a) You meet the requirement.  
  b) You do not already have a token there.  
- Boast triggers endgame when a player places their 4th glory token.  

SOLVE:  
- Available only if your mech is on the location matching a quest card you control.  
- Pay the cost (in power or guile).  
- Gain the benefit below the arrow.  
- Tuck the quest above your mech mat.  
- Return any worker.  
- Max 4 solved quests.  

VANQUISH:  
- Pay the cost of the topmost corruption (power for orange, guile for turquoise).  
- Gain the corruption token.  
- Repeat as long as you can pay.  
- When all corruption is removed, Upgrade, Meld, or Boast becomes available via Gather.  
- The 20-value corruption (on location 20) requires 10 power and 10 guile; worth $2.  

REFRESH:  
- Return all workers and active cards.  
- Shift action token to Refresh spot.  
- Only allowed if token was on Move, Play, or Gather at turn start.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after the player who placed the 4th glory token takes their final turn. All other players then take one more turn.  
- Final scoring:  
  - Coins: total value of all coins gained.  
  - Glory tokens: each scores based on number of solved quests:  
    - 0 solved = $5 per token  
    - 1 = $6  
    - 2 = $8  
    - 3+ = $10  
  - Upgraded items: each scores the coin value in its bottom-right corner.  
  - Corruption tokens: each worth $2 (including the 20-value token).  
- Total all values. Highest total wins.  
- Tiebreaker: player with the highest sum of all personal achievements (solved quests, melded meteorites, upgraded items, etc.) wins. If still tied, share victory.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I move if all locations are occupied?  
  No valid move possible? You may still take the Move action but forfeit movement.  
- Can I gain a card if the deck and sweep pile are empty?  
  No. If a benefit requires drawing and no cards remain, skip that part.  
- Can I use a card’s ability if I don’t place a worker?  
  No. Only placing a matching worker activates the ability.  
- Can I Solve a quest if the location has corruption?  
  Yes. Corruption does not block Solve.  
- Can I Upgrade an item with a worker on it?  
  Yes. Return the worker to your mat.  
- What happens to corruption if destroyed by an ability (not Vanquished)?  
  Return it to the bag.  
- Can I Boast multiple times in one turn?  
  No. Boast is a single Gather benefit. You may only Boast once per Gather action.
