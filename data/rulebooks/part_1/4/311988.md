Heated vs Cold Actions:  
- Always heated: Construct, Deploy Scouts, Special Actions  
- Always cold: Remove Snow  
- Heated or cold: Gather Resources, Use a Building  
- If Heat marker is on space 1, all Gather/Use actions are cold.  
- Actions in zones/buildings with Insulation level < Heat marker level are heated.

Sickness & Death:  
- Sickness marker advances when Citizen gets sick; flip if exceeds Citizen count.  
- Flip Syringe→Skull: gravely ill.  
- Flip Skull→Syringe: one Citizen dies; move marker back.  
- Death: move Corpse marker; decrease Citizen and Sickness markers; resolve death effect (draw or discard matching Citizen card).

Curing & Treating:  
- Cure X: move any Sickness marker left X spaces (cannot move Skull-side to 0).  
- Treat X: flip X Skull-side markers to Syringe without death.

- Increase (specific): draw random, then activate one of type.
