## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective
As the head of an ancient monastery, you aim to provide the people with the finest ale by cultivating your cloister’s garden. Players compete to collect resource and monk tiles, activate them for rewards, and complete objectives to earn victory points. The player who best balances resource development, brewmaster progression, and barrel acquisition wins by scoring the most victory points.

2. Components
- 1 main board
- 100 resource tiles (20 each of wood, yeast, hops, water, barley; fertility numbers 1–5; split into Level I and II)
- 24 monk tiles (12 Level I, 12 Level II)
- 49 shed tiles (double-sided, 5 types, 12 goals)
- 12 large barrels and 12 small barrels (matching types)
- 4 player boards
- 20 privilege cards (4 sets of 5)
- 4 player figures
- 4 brewmasters
- 20 resource markers (4 of each resource color)
- 36 scoring discs
- 69 ducats: 27 × 1, 14 × 5, 10 × 10
- (Solo variants include automa decks, but not part of base game)

3. Setup
I. Main Setup
1. Place main board in center.
2. Place ducats and scoring discs in reserves.
3. Resource Tiles: Create two face-down piles (I and II). Place one Level I tile face-up on each of the 15 resource spaces.
4. Shed Tiles: Sort by type into 5 piles; place beside board.
5. Monk Tiles:
   - Shuffle Level I monk tiles; place stack of 4 on each "I" space.
   - 2P: Return all Level II monks to box.
   - 3P: Shuffle Level II monks; place one stack of 4 on leftmost "II" space; return rest to box.
   - 4P: Shuffle Level II monks; place one stack of 4 on each "II" space.
6. Place one Level I monk face-up on each of the 4 monk spaces.
7. Place one scoring disc on each of the 6 scoring disc spaces.
8. Place one small barrel face-up on each barrel spot; place matching large barrel on top.

II. Player Setup
Each player:
A. Takes player board, 5 privilege cards, player figure, brewmaster, and 1 of each resource marker in their color.
B. Places brewmaster on starting spot (bottom-left of production track).
C. Places each resource marker on its starting spot (left column).
D. Takes 25 ducats (public knowledge).

III. Starting Player
- Randomly choose starting player.
- Starting player places figure on "First player starting space" (immediate reward: move brewmaster 1 step forward).
- Remaining players (counterclockwise) choose an empty starting space and take its immediate reward:
  - Move 1 resource marker 2 steps forward.
  - Take 2 ducats.
- Play proceeds clockwise from starting player.

4. Gameplay Flow
- Rounds: 3 (2P), 4 (3P), 6 (4P).
- On your turn:
  1. Move player figure clockwise any number of spaces (at least 1), but not past starting area.
  2. Must perform the action of the space landed on.
  3. You may land on occupied spaces.
  4. Cannot move to a space where you cannot perform the action (e.g., no available tile or disc, or unmet barrel condition).
- After action, next player’s turn.
- Moving to Starting Area:
  - Place figure on any empty starting space; take immediate reward if available.
  - You are out for the rest of the round.
  - When all players are in starting area, round ends.
  - If all others are in starting area and "First player" space is open, last player must take it.

5. Core Mechanics
Resource Spaces
- Must buy at least 1 resource tile from the space; may buy more if affordable.
- Cost:
  - Shady side: pay fertility number in ducats.
  - Sunny side: pay 2 × fertility number.
- Place tile on any empty shady or sunny spot (not shed spots).
- If placement encloses a shed spot (6 adjacent tiles), immediately trigger shed procedure.

Monk Spaces
- Must buy at least 1 monk tile; may buy more if affordable.
- Cost:
  - Shady side: pay monk cost number (from space) in ducats.
  - Sunny side: pay 2 × monk cost number.
- Place on any empty shady or sunny spot (not shed spots).
- If placement encloses a shed spot, trigger shed procedure.

Scoring Disc Spaces
- Take 1 scoring disc; place on eligible empty tile-scoring spot on your board.
- Disc source determines placement:
  - A → x-tile scoring spot (fertility number activation)
  - B → empty monk scoring spot
  - C → empty resource scoring spot
  - A/B/C → any empty scoring spot
- Perform corresponding action:
  A. Name a fertility number (1–5); activate all resource tiles with that number:
     - Shady: gain ducats = fertility number.
     - Sunny: move matching resource marker forward = fertility number.
  B. Trigger all monk tiles of that type:
     - Each triggers adjacent resource and monk tiles.
     - Resource: usual activation reward.
     - Monk: move brewmaster 1 step forward (per activated monk).
     - Resolve one monk at a time.
  C. Activate all resource tiles of that type:
     - Shady: gain ducats = fertility number.
     - Sunny: move matching resource marker forward = fertility number.
  A/B/C: perform A, B, or C action based on spot chosen.
- Restrictions:
  - Cannot move to empty or unusable disc space (spot occupied or no matching tiles).
  - After placing disc, check for completed privilege pairs.

Barrel Spaces
- May move here only if you have achieved at least one barrel goal.
- Take all remaining barrels for goals you’ve achieved:
  - Prefer large barrel (4 VP); if unavailable and you don’t have large, take small (2 VP).
  - Cannot take duplicates.
- Barrels remain with you until endgame.

Enclosing a Shed Spot
- When 6 adjacent spots around a shed are filled, trigger:
  1. Sum fertility numbers of adjacent resource tiles (monks count as 0).
  2. Use shed fertility sum to determine reward:
     - 0–2: move brewmaster 0 steps; activate 0 tiles.
     - 3–5: move brewmaster 1 step; activate 2 opposite tiles.
     - 6–8: move brewmaster 2 steps; activate 4 tiles.
     - 9–11: move brewmaster 3 steps; activate 1 tile.
     - 12–14: move brewmaster 4 steps; activate 3 non-adjacent tiles.
     - 15+: move brewmaster 6 steps; activate 2 opposite tiles.
  3. Take corresponding shed tile; place on enclosed shed.
  4. Activate specified adjacent tiles (usual rewards).
- Resolve immediately.

Completing a Privilege Pair
- 5 pairs on player board: (X + Wood), (Yeast + Hops), (Water + Barley), (Monk1+Monk2), (Monk3+Monk4).
- When both spots in a pair are filled with scoring discs, may immediately place one privilege card next to it and resolve its effect.
- If not placed at that moment, cannot be placed later.

Emergency Coin Rule
- At any time during your turn, return an unplaced privilege card to the box to gain 3 ducats.

6. Scoring & End Game
End of Game
- Game ends after final round when last player enters starting area and takes reward.
- Final scoring:

1. Brewmaster Position:
   - Determines resource exchange rate and victory point (VP) value:
     - Spots 1–5: 5:1, 2 VP
     - Spots 6–10: 4:1, 3 VP
     - Spots 11–15: 3:1, 4 VP
     - Spots 16–19: 2:1, 5 VP
     - Spot 20+: 1:1, 6 VP

2. Balance Resource Markers:
   a. Use exchange rate (e.g., 3:1 = move 3 steps back to move 1 step forward on least-advanced marker).
   b. Apply repeatedly until no further advancement possible.
   c. Then, for every 10 ducats spent, move any resource marker 1 step forward.

3. Calculate Victory Points:
   a. Production Score: (Number of space of furthest-behind resource marker) × (VP value from brewmaster).
      - If any marker hasn’t reached brown "1" spot, score is 0.
   b. Barrel Points:
      - 4 VP per large barrel.
      - 2 VP per small barrel.
      - If barrel privilege card is played, +1 VP per barrel.
   c. First Player Bonus: +1 VP if figure is on "First player" space.
   d. Total = Production Score + Barrel Points + Bonus.

- Highest score wins. Ties result in shared victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- Resource markers: Cannot exceed space 20. Each extra step grants 1 ducat instead.
- Scoring discs in final round:
  - 2P/3P: Spaces B, C, and (in 3P) first A/B/C get second disc.
  - Player still takes only one disc per visit.
- Privilege cards: Can only be played when pair is completed; emergency use always allowed.
- Barrel goals: Must meet condition exactly; cannot claim if goal not met.
- Movement: Must move at least one space; cannot stay or move backward.
- Ties: All tied players win.
