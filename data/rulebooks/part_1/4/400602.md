2. **New Goals**: In turn order, each player may take 1 Goal Chip. Refill display after all choose.  
3. **Extra Find**: In turn order, each player places 1 marker in storage matching a territory type they occupy.  
4. **Action Phase**: Players take turns activating modules or doing Resets until phase indicator reaches end space. Final round gives each one last turn.  
5. **Site Phase**: Resolve effects of Gorge, Glacier, Mystic Oak.  
6. **Feeding Phase**: Feed tribes; score 1 SP per strong tribe.  
7. **Event Phase**: Adjust weather, resolve event, score current era’s category, determine next starting player.

After 4th era, skip final two steps and begin final scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Modules  
Each turn, activate a module using exactly 2 Activation Dice showing required values. Use Idea Markers (1 per pip change) or Planning Markers (value = die space) to adjust.  
- **Sleep Module**: Use any 2 dice. Gain 1 Focus or 2 Ideas.  
- **Feature Modules**: Use 2 dice of value shown. Place 1 marker on linked feature.  
- **Main Modules**: Upgradeable (I → II → III). Level II flips tile; Level III removes it.  

#### Actions  
- **Migration (1-3)**: Move 1 strong tribe to adjacent territory, settle on encampment. Displacing weakens your tribe. First to settle reveals resource. Level II/III allow more moves if favor test passed.  
- **Procreation (2-5)**: Add tribe to encampment in occupied territory. Displacing weakens new tribe. Can procreate on boat with 1 tribe. Level III allows strengthening if favor test passed.  
- **Production (3-5)**: Produce 2–4 raw materials in territories with your tribes. If favor test passed, transport 1–2 to storage.  
- **Transport (1-5)**: Move up to 3, 6, or all raw materials from map to storage. Level III allows placing boat resources in any storage.  
- **Sustenance (2-4)**: Hunt (roll Fate Dice, gain food per table) or strengthen 1–4 tribes.  
- **Exploration (1-4)**: Reveal adjacent sites (+SP) or make lucky find (roll Fate Dice, gain storage resource).  
- **Building (4-6)**: Build Farm (free, gain Idea), Boat (free, move tribe), Statue (pay material, advance progress track), or Settlement (pay cost, gain Income Chip). Level III allows ignoring one cost or installing two cards.  
- **Planning (3-4)**: Install Goal Chip or place 2–3 Planning Markers on one die space.  
- **Research (1-2)**: Gain 1–2 research cards from face-up or face-down stacks.  
- **Achievement (5-6)**: Gain 1–2 Activation/Fate Dice. If none available, take from player with most.  
- **Insight (3-6)**: Gain 3–6 Idea Markers.  
- **Mutation (2-6)**: Move 1–2 Feature Markers to any feature space.  
- **Invention (1-6)**: Perform 1–2 Income Chip actions.  
- **Trade (4-5)**: Sell up to 2 resources (1 for money, 1 for 2 SP); buy 1 resource (2 money if revealed, 4 if not).  
- **Activity (2-3)**: Perform 1–2 Activities (e.g., pay $1 to advance progress track).  

#### Resets  
When ≤3 Activation Dice on board:  
A. Move phase indicator to next reset space.  
B. Retrieve used dice, reroll all, place by value.  
C. Place reset marker on Idea or Food space.  

#### Favor Test  
Required for some actions. Roll all Fate Dice. Pass if at least one die ≤ position on Favor of Agera track. Use Idea Markers to adjust die values.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### During Game  
- **Phase 7 (Event Phase)**: Score current era’s category (value × units).  
  - *Progress Tracks*: 1 SP per step.  
  - *Evolution*: 1 SP per feature marker.  
  - *Prosperity*: 1 SP per active diamond (food: 3 per column; money: 2 per column; settlements: visible diamonds; storage: diamonds with materials above and below).  
  - *Population*: 1 SP per tribe on continent.  
  - *Expansion*: 1 SP per territory with tribe.  
- **Phase 8 (Income Phase)**:

#### Final Scoring (4th Era)  
1. Score all 9 categories as above.  
2. Score console:  
   - **Stage 1–5**: 2/3/4/7/10 SP per card/chip in that stage.  
   - **Stages 4–5**: Only score if stage tile is active (flipped).  
3. Score column bonuses: For each card with point bonus icon, gain SP per card/income chip in that column (including itself).  
4. **Winning**: Most SP wins. Tie: most module upgrades, then turn order.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **No dice available**: Take from player with most. If tied, choose.  
- **No cards in face-up stack**: Reveal top of face-down stack to form new stack.  
- **Goal Area full**: Place new Goal Chip on top; only top chip can be installed.  
- **Favor Test at max track**: Automatically pass.  
- **Cannot feed tribe**: Strong → weak; weak → die (can use "Deus ex machina" to save by moving back on Favor track).  
- **Building Limits**: 1 Settlement + 1 Statue or 2 Statues per Building Ground.  
- **Overpaying Cards**: Can pay higher stage costs to gain VP, but must fulfill all active costs of that stage.  
- **Income Chip in Full Column**: Place in lowest empty stage; cannot float.
