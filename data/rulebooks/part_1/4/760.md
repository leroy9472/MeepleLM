## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Battle Line*, players take on the roles of opposing generals in an ancient battle, commanding forces across a front of nine flags. The objective is to gain tactical superiority by forming powerful military formations on the battlefield. Victory is achieved by either securing three adjacent flags (a Breakthrough) or capturing any five flags (an Envelopment).

### 2. Components  
- **60 Troop Cards**: Six colors (e.g., red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange), values 1–10.  
  - 10 = Elephants (or Air Support in Star Wars theme)  
  - 9 = Chariots (or AT-ATs)  
  - 8 = Heavy Cavalry (or AT-STs)  
  - 7 = Light Cavalry (or Speeder Bikes)  
  - 6 = Hypaspists (or Elite Troopers)  
  - 5 = Phalangists (or Shock Troopers)  
  - 4 = Hoplites (or Rocket Launchers)  
  - 3 = Javelineers (or Snipers)  
  - 2 = Peltasts (or Scouts)  
  - 1 = Skirmishers (or Probe Droids)  
- **10 Tactics Cards**: Divided into three categories: Morale, Environment, and Guile.  
- **9 Flags**: Markers placed between players to represent contested positions.

### 3. Setup  
- Place the 9 flags in a straight line between the two players.  
- Shuffle the Troop deck. One player cuts the deck; the player with the higher card deals. That player shuffles and deals 7 Troop Cards to each player.  
- Place the remaining Troop Cards face down at one end of the flag line.  
- Shuffle the 10 Tactics Cards and place them face down at the other end of the flag line.  
- The non-dealer takes the first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, follow these steps:  
1. **Claim Flags (Advanced Rule Only)**: At the beginning of the turn, a player may claim one or more flags if eligible.  
2. **Play a Card**: Play one card from hand:  
   - A **Troop Card** to a flag (into one of three available slots on your side).  
   - A **Tactics Card** according to its type (Morale, Environment, or Guile).  
3. **Draw a Card**: Draw one card from either the Troop or Tactics deck to restore hand size to seven.  
   - If both decks are empty, no draw occurs.  
4. **Claim Flags (Standard Rule Only)**: After playing and drawing, a player may claim flags if eligible.

> **Note**: The Advanced Rule moves flag claiming to step 1 and removes it from step 4.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Formations (Ranked High to Low)  
Each flag is contested by comparing the best 3-card (or 4-card, if modified) formation on each side.  
1. **Wedge**: Three cards of the same color with consecutive values (e.g., Red 3, 4, 5).  
2. **Phalanx**: Three cards of the same value (e.g., 8 of Red, Yellow, Green).  
3. **Battalion Order**: Three cards of the same color (e.g., Blue 2, 4, 7).  
4. **Skirmish Line**: Three cards with consecutive values, any colors (e.g., 4, 5, 6).  
5. **Host**: Any other combination (e.g., 5, 5, 3).

#### Comparing Formations  
- Higher-ranked formation wins.  
- If same type, higher total sum wins.  
- If sums are equal, the player who played the **last card** into the formation **loses** the flag.

#### Claiming a Flag  
A player may claim a flag when:  
- Their side has a complete formation (3 cards, or 4 if Mud/Sand Storm is in effect).  
- They can **prove** that the opponent cannot beat it using only visible information (discards, played cards, claimed flags).  
  - Cannot use hand knowledge or unplayed Tactics.  
- Claiming is possible even if the opponent hasn’t completed their side.  

Once claimed:  
- The player takes the flag and places it in front of them.  
- No further cards or effects can be applied to that flag.

#### Tactics Cards  
A player may never have played more than **one more Tactics Card** than their opponent.  

##### Morale Tactics (played into formation slots)  
- **Leader (Alexander/Darius/Vader/Emperor)**: Wild card. Choose color and value when resolved. Only one Leader allowed per player at a time.  
- **Companion Cavalry / General Veers**: Value 8. Choose color when resolved.  
- **Shield Bearers / Boba Fett**: Value ≤3. Choose color and exact value when resolved.

##### Environment Tactics (played face-up next to a flag)  
- **Fog / Sand Storm**: Disables all formations. Winner is determined by **total sum of cards** (3 or 4).  
- **Mud / Dunes**: Formations require **4 cards** instead of 3. All formation rules scale accordingly.

##### Guile Tactics (played face-up next to player’s Tactics deck)  
- **Scout / Spy**: Draw 3 cards. Then choose 2 to place face down on top of either deck(s).  
- **Redeploy**: Move one card from your side of any unclaimed flag to another slot, or discard it.  
- **Deserter / Force Choke**: Discard one card from opponent’s side of an unclaimed flag.  
- **Traitor / Force Corrupt**: Take one **Troop Card** from opponent’s side of an unclaimed flag and place it in an empty slot on your side.

> All Guile and Environment cards remain in play once used.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition**: First player to claim **3 adjacent flags** or **5 total flags** wins immediately.  
- **Scoring (for multi-game sessions)**:  
  - Winner: 5 points  
  - Loser: 1 point per flag they claimed  
- The winner of a game starts the next game.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a Tactics Card if my opponent has played more?**  
  Yes. You can play as long as you haven’t exceeded your opponent by more than one.  
- **What if I can’t play a Troop Card?**  
  You may play a Tactics Card or pass. Play continues until the game ends.  
- **Can I claim a flag with incomplete opponent side?**  
  Yes, if you can prove no possible card combination can beat your formation.  
- **Do Environment effects override formation rules?**  
  Yes. Fog/Sand Storm disables formations; Mud/Dunes increases required cards to 4.  
- **Can I use a Leader as any number?**  
  Yes, but only one Leader may be in play per player.  
- **What happens to cards on a claimed flag?**  
  They are locked. No further interaction is allowed.
