## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Acquire is a strategic tile-placement and stock investment game. Players act as investors building hotel chains by placing tiles on a grid. The objective is to maximize personal wealth through stock ownership, merger bonuses, and end-game payouts. The game emphasizes strategic placement, timing of investments, and merger exploitation rather than simulating real stock markets.

2. Components  
- Game board (grid labeled 1–12 and A–I)  
- 108 hotel tiles (numbered 1–12, lettered A–I)  
- 7 hotel chain markers (e.g., Continental, Imperial, etc.)  
- Stock certificates for 7 hotel chains  
- Money: denominations of $100, $500, $1000  
- Player reference/information cards  
- Banker’s tray for money and stock  
- Tile racks (optional)

3. Setup  
- Place the board in the center. Shuffle all hotel tiles face down into a draw pile.  
- Choose a banker to manage money and stock supply.  
- Each player receives:  
  • $6,000 ($4×1000, $3×500, $5×100)  
  • 6 random tiles (drawn face down and kept secret)  
  • 1 information card (tracking stock prices and bonuses)  
- Determine first player: Each player draws one tile and places it on its matching board position. The player whose tile is closest to 1A goes first (e.g., 1B is closer than 2A; 9A is closer than 1B). These starting tiles remain on the board.  
- No corporations are formed during setup unless tiles are orthogonally adjacent.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, perform the following in order:  
1. **Play a Tile**: Place one tile from hand onto its matching space on the board.  
2. **Resolve Tile Effects**:  
   - **Form a Corporation**: If the placed tile is adjacent (orthogonally) to one or more unaffiliated tiles (not part of any corporation), and at least one chain is still available, the player may:  
     • Choose a chain name from the available ones  
     • Place a building marker on one of the tiles in the new chain  
     • Receive 1 free share (founder’s bonus) in that corporation, if stock is available  
   - **Merge Corporations**: If the placed tile connects two or more corporations (each <11 tiles in size), a merger occurs:  
     • The largest corporation (by tile count, excluding the placed tile) survives.  
     • In case of a tie in size, the active player chooses which survives.  
     • Defunct corporation markers are returned to supply.  
     • Pay merger bonuses:  
       - Majority shareholder bonus (largest holder in defunct corp)  
       - Minority shareholder bonus (second-largest holder)  
       - If only one player holds shares, they receive both bonuses.  
       - If tied for majority, combine both bonuses and split equally (round up if odd).  
       - If tied for minority, split minority bonus only.  
     • After payouts, starting with the merging player, each player may handle defunct stock:  
       - **Hold**: Keep shares for possible future reactivation  
       - **Sell**: Sell back to bank at pre-merger price  
       - **Trade**: Exchange 2 shares of defunct corp for 1 share of surviving corp (if available)  
   - **Expand a Corporation**: If the tile is adjacent to only one existing corporation, it expands. No bonuses; stock value increases based on new size.  
   - **Invalid Placement**: If a tile would merge two safe corporations (≥11 tiles) or form an 8th corporation, it cannot be played and is discarded.  
3. **Buy Stock**: Purchase up to 3 total shares, in any combination of active corporations. Shares bought at current price based on corporation size.  
4. **Discard and Draw**: Discard any unplayable tiles (those that would cause illegal mergers). Draw tiles to restore hand to 6 tiles.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Tile Placement**: Must place exactly one tile per turn. Adjacency is orthogonal only (no diagonals).  
- **Corporation Formation**: Requires at least 2 adjacent unaffiliated tiles after placement. Max 7 corporations exist.  
- **Safe Corporations**: A corporation with 11 or more tiles is “safe” and cannot be absorbed. It can absorb smaller ones or grow.  
- **Stock Pricing**: Stock value increases as the corporation grows. Prices are fixed per size (see information card).  
- **Merger Order**: If more than two corporations merge, resolve by size: largest absorbs second-largest, then third-largest, etc.  
- **Stock Transactions**:  
  - Buying: Only from bank, up to 3 shares per turn  
  - Selling: Only during post-merger phase or end game  
  - Trading: Only 2:1 during merger resolution  
- **Two-Player Variant**: To determine merger bonuses, draw a random unplayed tile. Its number represents the “bank’s” shares in the defunct corporation for ranking purposes.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when, on a player’s turn, one of the following occurs:  
  a) Any single corporation reaches 41 or more tiles  
  b) All active corporations on the board are safe (≥11 tiles each)  
- The current player may choose not to declare the end, even if conditions are met.  
- When the game ends:  
  1. Pay majority and minority bonuses for each active corporation (same rules as mergers).  
  2. All players sell remaining stock back to the bank at current market price.  
  3. Stock in chains not currently on the board is worthless.  
- The player with the most total money wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Tied for Majority**: Combine majority and minority bonuses; split equally. Round up if odd.  
- **Tied for Minority**: Split minority bonus only.  
- **Only One Shareholder in Defunct Corp**: That player receives both bonuses.  
- **Forming a Corp with No Available Names**: Cannot form if all 7 chains are already in play. Tile may not be placed.  
- **Unplayable Tiles**: Any tile that would merge two safe corporations or create an 8th corporation is unplayable. Discard it and draw a replacement.  
- **Stock Availability**: If stock runs out, no one can buy it until it becomes available (e.g., via trade or return).  
- **Merger Bonuses Table**: Refer to information card (e.g., majority: $8,000/$6,000/$5,000 for large/medium/small corps; minority: $4,000/$3,000/$2,000).
