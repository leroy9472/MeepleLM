## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

Over four generations (rounds), players expand across terrain, hunt megafauna, build megaliths, and develop cultural traditions. The objective is to score the most points through a combination of end-game scoring mechanisms, including idol tracks, card sets, and cultural achievements.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 4 rounds. Each round has 3 phases:
1. **Action Phase**: Players take 3 turns each in turn order.
2. **Eclipse Phase**: Adjust turn order; perform Eclipse actions.
3. **Preparation Phase**: Advance round, refill cards, draw 5 cards (skip in final round).

After Round 4 Eclipse Phase, proceed to Final Scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Action Phase (per turn)
1. **Play Culture Cards (Optional)**: Play any number. First is free; each additional costs 1 card discarded from hand.
2. **Place Figure & Perform Actions**: Place 1 figure on:
   - **Main Board Action Column** (Top, Middle, Bottom)  
   - **Player Board Rest Space**
   
   **Action Columns**:
   - **Initiate** (Gain Tribe Cards / Bury Cards):  
     - Top: Spend 1 Tool + 1 Labor → take 1 face-up Tribe card (no duplicates per turn). Cannot use for Labor this turn.  
     - Middle: Spend 1 Food → take 1 Tribe card to discard and/or bury 1 card.  
     - Bottom (1st player only): Gain 1 Idol; may bury 1 card.  
   - **Develop** (Gain Culture Cards / Sacred Stones):  
     - Top: Spend 3 Labor → take 1 Culture card.  
     - Middle: Take 1 Sacred Stone (Era I: left section only). Pay cost; place on board; gain benefit.  
     - Bottom (1st only): Gain 1 Food, 1 Tool.  
   - **Migrate** (Place/Move Camps, Build Villages):  
     - Top: Spend 1 Tool → place leftmost Camp on Base tile; AND/OR spend 1 Labor → move 1 Camp 1 hex.  
     - Middle: Spend 3 Food → return 3 Camps from 3 adjacent hexes; place 1 Village on their juncture.  
     - Bottom (1st only): Perform Top action for free.  
   - **Hunt** (Draw/Gain/Tip Animals):  
     - Top: Spend 1 Labor → reveal 2 Animal cards (max 6 in Hunting Grounds); AND/OR spend 1 Tool + 1 Labor → take 1 Animal card.  
     - Middle: Tip 1 Animal → gain on-card benefits.  
     - Bottom (1st only): Take top Animal deck card → add to Animal area.  
   - **Rest**: Draw 1 card and tip 1 Animal. Does not allow Tribe card play. Each Rest figure provides 1.5 Labor in Eclipse Phase.

3. **Discard Played Cards**: All played cards go to discard pile.
4. **Prepare Eclipse Pile (3rd turn only)**: Place any number of cards face-down in Eclipse pile.

#### Eclipse Phase
1. Move Round Marker to Eclipse space.
2. All players reveal Eclipse Piles. Calculate Labor:
   - Labor from revealed Tribe cards
   - 1.5 Labor per figure on Rest space
   - Culture cards do not contribute Labor (used for bluffing)
3. Reorder Turn Order Track by Labor (highest first). Tiebreaker: player who acted later wins.
4. In new order, each player:
   a. Gain Turn Order benefit (or lesser benefit).
   b. Resolve Eclipse abilities on cards in Eclipse pile.
   c. Gain Terrain benefits where they have most Influence:
      - Camp = 1 Influence
      - Village = 2 Influence (on each of 3 hexes)
      - Ties: all tied players gain benefit.
   d. Gain Player Board benefits (e.g., draw card per Village, gain Tool/Idol per empty Megalith space).
   e. Gain Sacred Stone benefits (if placed).
   f. Gain Animal benefits (up to number of non-tipped animals of that type).
   g. Gain Raft benefit (if closest to Delta: 1 pt + 1 pt per Camp on River).
   h. Gain Landmark benefit (most Influence).
   i. Gain Fish benefit (most Influence on River draws 1 Fish, gains benefit, discards).
5. Discard Eclipse pile cards.

#### Preparation Phase (Rounds 1–3)
1. Advance Round Marker to next numbered space.
2. Return all figures to player boards.
3. Refill Hunting Grounds to (players +1) cards.
4. Refill Culture Display:
   - End of Round 1: refill with Era I cards; move Culture Cap to top of Era I deck.
   - End of Round 2: remove all; refill with 8 Era II cards.
   - End of Round 3: refill empty spaces with Era II cards.
5. Return Raft to Headwaters (if used).
6. Reveal new Rest Token (if used).
7. Each player draws 5 cards.

#### Megaliths
- When gaining a "Place Megalith" benefit, place leftmost Megalith.
- Placement rules:
  1. On gray starting space (gray Megaliths only).
  2. Orthogonally adjacent to another Megalith.
  3. Stacked on top of 2×2 group of Megaliths.
- First two placed must be gray and on board (not stacked).
- Scoring:
  - Placed on board: gain space benefit.
  - Stacked: gain 2 pts per own, 1 pt per opponent’s; opponents gain 1 pt per their own.

#### Idol Board
- Each time you gain an Idol, move one marker up 1 level on either track.
- **Offering Track (Left)**: Determines value of leftover Food/Tools at endgame. Entering spaces grants immediate benefits. At top, each additional Idol grants 1 pt.
- **Honor Track (Right)**: Determines value of Buried cards. Enter leftmost space on level. Entering levels grants immediate points. Cannot advance past top.

#### Lesser Benefits
When gaining a benefit, you may choose a lesser one:
Place Megalith > Draw Card > Gain Idol > Gain Tool > Gain Food

#### Food Limit
Food capacity = 7 minus number of removed Camps.

#### Card Abilities
- **Tribe Cards**: Play for Labor and/or ability. Eclipse abilities only trigger if in Eclipse pile.
- **Culture Cards**: Play for action; discard after turn.
- **Chief Cards**: Use ability once per turn when placing Chief figure.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Final Scoring occurs after Round 4 Eclipse Phase.
1. **Offering Track**: Score for leftover Food/Tools based on ratio (e.g., 3:1). Unadvanced track = 0.
2. **Honor Track**: Score for Buried cards based on relative position. Unadvanced = 0.
3. **Tribe & Culture Cards**: Sum endgame points from all cards (hand, deck, discard, burial).
4. **Animal Cards**: Score for sets of upright (non-tipped) cards. Max set size per type (e.g., 4 for most, 2 for Mammoths). Argentavis = wild.
5. **Cave Painting (if used)**: 1 pt per painted dot in longest outer-line route.
6. **Tiebreaker**: Player ahead on Turn Order Track wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Empty Decks**: Shuffle discard pile to form new deck.
- **Empty Card Supplies**: If no Tribe/Culture/Animal cards available, gain 1 point instead.
- **Glacier Tokens**: Revealed when Camp moves through or onto hex. Benefits trigger when placing Villages on adjacent hexes.
- **Rest Tokens**: First player to Rest chooses token or flips it; used during Rest action.
- **Solo Mode**: Nomad uses deck to determine actions; gains 2 pts per Sacred Stone in Eclipse.
- **Eclipse Tie**: Player who acted later in round wins.
- **Megalith Stacking**: Only scores for the four directly underneath.
