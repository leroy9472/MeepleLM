## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Century: Spice Road*, players take on the role of spice merchants seeking fortune by collecting, upgrading, and trading spices to claim valuable point cards. The goal is to amass the highest score by efficiently managing resources and actions.

### 2. Components
- **Orange-backed Point Cards**: Score points when claimed; arranged in a row.
- **Purple-backed Merchant Cards**: Used to gain, trade, or upgrade spices.

- **Spice Cubes**: In four colors: yellow (turmeric), red (saffron), green (cardamom), brown (cinnamon).
- **Gold and Silver Coins/Tokens**: Bonus scoring tokens placed above the first two Point Cards.
- **Starting Cards**: Each player receives one "Create 2" (spice card) and one "Upgrade 2" card.
- **First Player Marker**: Embedded on one Caravan card.

### 3. Setup
1. **Point Cards**: Shuffle the deck and lay out 5 face-up in a row. Place 2× number of players in gold coins above the leftmost card and same number of silver coins above the second.
2. **Merchant Cards**: Shuffle the remaining (non-starting) purple cards and lay out 6 face-up in a row.
3. **Spice Bowls**: Place cubes in ascending order: yellow → red → green → brown.
4. **Caravan Cards**: Shuffle and deal one to each player. The player with the first-player symbol starts.
5. **Starting Resources**:
   - 1st player: 3 yellow cubes
   - 2nd & 3rd players: 4 yellow cubes each
   - 4th & 5th players: 3 yellow + 1 red cube each
6. **Hands**: Each player gets one "Create 2" and one "Upgrade 2" card.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise, performing **one** of four actions per turn:
1. **Play a Card**
2. **Acquire a Merchant Card**
3. **Rest**
4. **Claim a Point Card**

#### Play a Card
Place a card from hand in front of you and resolve its effect:
- **Spice Card**: Gain cubes shown on the card.
- **Upgrade Card (e.g., "Upgrade 2")**: Upgrade up to 2 cubes (one level each). You may upgrade the same cube twice (e.g., yellow → red → green). Upgrades are optional; you may stop early.
- **Trade Card**: Return cubes above the arrow from your caravan and gain cubes below the arrow. Repeat as long as you can afford it.

Cards remain face-up until you Rest.

#### Acquire a Merchant Card
- Take any face-up Merchant card into your hand.
- For each card to the **left** of the one acquired, place **one cube** (any color) from your caravan onto it.
- **Exception**: The leftmost card is free (no payment).
- Take any cubes already on the acquired card and add them to your caravan.
- Slide remaining cards left and refill the rightmost spot from the deck.

#### Rest
- Take all previously played cards back into your hand.
- This is your only action this turn.

#### Claim a Point Card
- Pay the exact number and color of cubes shown on the card.
- Return cubes to the supply.
- Take the Point Card and place it **face-down** in front of you.
- If claiming the **leftmost or second-leftmost** card, also take 1 gold or silver coin above it.
- **Coin Rule**: If gold coins run out, move silver coins to the first position.
- Slide cards left and refill from the deck.

#### Caravan Limit
- At the end of your turn, you may have **no more than 10 cubes** on your caravan.
- Discard excess cubes of your choice.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Cube Conversion**: Upgrade yellow → red → green → brown. Each upgrade increases value.
- **Deckbuilding**: Acquiring new cards and reusing played ones via Rest builds strategic flexibility.
- **Opportunity Cost**: Choosing to acquire cards costs cubes; claiming early Point Cards gives coins but lower points.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End**: Triggered when any player claims their **5th Point Card** (6th in 2–3 player games).
- After the current round completes (all players have equal turns), scoring begins.
- **Final Score**:
  - Points from claimed **Point Cards**
  - **Gold coins**: 3 points each
  - **Silver coins**: 1 point each
  - **Non-yellow cubes** on caravan: 1 point each (red, green, brown)
- **Tiebreaker**: The player who acted **last** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I hide cubes or cards?** No. All cubes on caravan and played cards must be visible.
- **Can I claim a card from the deck?** No. Only face-up cards in the row.
- **How many times can I use a Trade card?** As many times as you can afford during your turn.
- **Must I use all upgrades on an Upgrade card?** No. You may stop after any upgrade.
- **Can I upgrade a cube beyond brown?** No. Brown is the highest level.
- **What if the Merchant row runs out?** Refill immediately after each acquisition.
- **Can I claim a Point Card I can’t afford?** No. You must have exact cubes.
