### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds clockwise starting from player left of Solstice card.  
On a turn, a player chooses:  
- **Activate**  
- **Innovate**  
- **Revolt**  
Then performs **Clean Up**.  

After all players take a turn, **Solstice** is resolved before next round.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
**Activate**:  
- Spend ● to play cards (max 3 per turn)  
- Play card from hand → resolve effect → discard (unless Pinned or Exhausted)  
- Can only play cards matching State Card icon (🟥 or 🟩)  
- Use Exhaust abilities (max 5 per turn):  
  - Pay × from State Card → resolve Exhaust effect  
  - Can use on any card in play or Power Card  
  - Cannot exhaust same card twice per turn  

**Innovate**:  
- Discard entire hand  
- Break Through for 🟢, 🔵, or 🟧  
- Then Clean Up  

**Revolt**:  
- Return any number of 🟥 cards from hand to Unrest pile  
- Then Clean Up  

**Break Through**:  
Choose one:  
1. Take suit card from market (+ tokens, no 🟥)  
2. Take top 🟢 card (if breaking for 🟢)  
3. Take top 🔵 card (if 🔵)  
4. Take top 🟧 card (if 🟧)  
5. Reveal from Main Deck until matching suit found; take it, reshuffle rest  

**Acquire**:  
- Take suit card from market → add to hand (+ tokens + underlying 🟥 card)  
- Replace with new card from appropriate deck (+ 🟥 underneath if applicable)  

**Clean Up**:  
1. Add 1 ▶ to any card in market  
   - Carthaginians: Add 1–2 🔸 (as on Power Card)  
   - Qin: Add 1 🔺  
2. Remove all ● and × tokens from all cards and State Card  
3. Place 3 ● and 5 × on State Card (3 × for Utopians)  
4. Discard any number of cards from hand  
5. Draw up to 5 cards  

**Reshuffling**:  
When draw deck empty:  
- If State = 🟥:  
  1. If no × on Nation Deck and × on State Card → place top Nation card in discard, move × to Nation Deck  
  2. If ● card placed → flip State Card to 🟩 (become Empire)  
     - Arthurians: Place ● in play, do not flip  
     - Vikings: Place ● in discard → game end  
  3. Shuffle discard → new draw deck  
- If State = 🟩:  
  1. If no × in Development Area and × on State Card → may pay cost to develop a ★ card → place in discard, move × to Development Area  
     - Utopians: Skip (no Development Area)  
  2. Shuffle discard → new draw deck  

**Solstice**:  
After final player’s turn in round:  
- All players resolve Solstice keywords in any order  
- Must resolve as much as possible  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Triggers (Scoring)**:  
1. Main Deck empty  
2. Any player develops last Development card (Arthurians: does not trigger when last quest moved)  
3. King of Kings flipped face down  
4. Viking places Harald Hardrada ● in discard  
5. Arthurian plays Graal ● card  
6. Utopian has ≥24 🔺 and triggers Solstice on Shangri-La Journey Card  

**Collapse Trigger**:  
- Unrest pile empty → game ends immediately  

**Scoring Procedure**:  
- If scoring triggered: complete current round → play one final round → resolve Solstice → score  
- Score all cards in: hand, play area, draw deck, discard pile, history, Power Card  
- Do not score: Nation Deck, Development Area  
- Scoring:  
  - ▶ = 1 VP  
  - X = X VP  
  - ? = VP if condition met  
  - * = variable VP (up to 10)  
- Highest score wins; tie = shared victory  

**Collapse Scoring**:  
- Immediate end  
- Count total cards in hand, play area, draw deck, discard, history  
- Fewest cards wins; tie → proceed to normal scoring  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Utopians**: No Nation Deck, no Development Cards. Journey Card has Solstice effect to advance.  
- **Arthurians**: Quests instead of Development. Graal becomes active only if no other quests.  
- **Vikings**: Never become Empire. Nation Deck provides free cards. Harald Hardrada discard ends game.  
- **Atlanteans**: Start as Empire. Use Sink to place cards under Power → score VP.  
- **Carthaginians & Qin**: Modify Clean Up token placement (🔸 or 🔺 instead of ▶)  
- **Bot Rules (Solo)**:  
  - Bot resolves cards via reference tables  
  - Rolls die to set aside one card slot  
  - Gains cards to top of Bot Deck  
  - Acquires highest-value market card (tie: most tokens → lowest slot)  
  - King of Kings: Bot gains 6 ▶ (if 🟥) or 3 ▶ + top Dynasty card (if 🟩)
