## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Small World is a fantasy-themed strategy board game where players lead declining civilizations across a dynamic map. The objective is to conquer regions, score Victory coins, and accumulate the highest total by the end of the game.

### 2. Components
- Game board (with player-count variants)
- Race banners (with token counts and in-decline sides)
- Special Power badges
- Race tokens (in player colors)
- Victory coins (value 1)
- Reinforcement die
- Game round marker
- Terrain markers (Mountains, Lost Tribes, Monsters)
- Special tokens (e.g., Dragon, Catapult, Fortresses, Encampments, Loot markers, Winter markers, etc.)

### 3. Setup
- Select the appropriate map for the number of players and place the game round marker on the first space.
- Shuffle Race banners and Special Power badges separately. Lay out 5 Race banners in a column; place the remaining stack face-up below. Repeat with Special Power badges, pairing one with each Race banner.
- Place Lost Tribe tokens on regions marked with a target symbol. Place Mountain tokens on mountain regions.
- Each player receives 5 Victory coins.
- Determine the starting player. Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each player's turn consists of one of two actions:
1. **Expand with Active Race**  
   - Ready Your Troops: Leave one token in each occupied region, take the rest into hand.
   - Conquer: Use tokens to conquer adjacent (or special-case) regions.
   - Final Conquest: Optionally roll the Reinforcement Die if short by 3 or fewer tokens.
   - Redeploy: Rearrange tokens among your regions.
   - Score: Collect 1 Victory coin per occupied region (active and in-decline), plus any bonuses.
2. **Put Active Race in Decline**  
   - Flip Race banner to in-decline side; discard Special Power.
   - Flip one token per region to in-decline side; return others to tray.
   - Remove any prior in-decline race.
   - Score as above.
   - On next turn, select a new combo and begin anew.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Conquering Regions**: Requires 2 base tokens +1 per defender/obstacle (Lost Tribe, opponent token, Mountain, Fortress, etc.).
- **First Conquest**: Must be on a border region (adjacent to map edge or sea).
- **Subsequent Conquests**: Must be adjacent to an existing region (unless Flying, Slingmen, etc.).
- **Final Conquest**: With Reinforcement Die, can attempt conquest if short by 3 or fewer tokens.
- **Enemy Losses**: Conquered players lose one token to the tray; others are held and redeployed after all conquests.
- **Redeployment**: At turn end, rearrange active tokens, leaving at least one per region.
- **In-Decline Races**: Score 1 coin per region. Only one in-decline race per player, unless Spirit power is active.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Scoring**: Each turn, collect 1 Victory coin per region occupied (active and in-decline). Add bonuses from Race, Special Power, Relics, or Places.
- **Game End**: After all players complete the 10th round (or 8th/9th depending on map), the game ends.
- **Winning**: Player with the most Victory coins wins. Tiebreaker: most total race tokens (active + in-decline) on the board.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **All Active Tokens Lost**: Player may either score with in-decline race only, or go into decline and score 0.
- **Tiebreakers**: Bivouacs, Fortresses, and other markers do not count as race tokens for tiebreaks.
- **Flying Giants**: Flying allows non-adjacent conquests, but Giants' Mountain-adjacent bonus only applies to physically adjacent regions.
- **Ghouls in Decline**: Conquer before active race. Can re-deploy after being attacked. Act as full active race.
- **Sorcerers Entering Board**: Non-Flying Sorcerers cannot use substitution power to enter; Flying Sorcerers can.
- **Encampments**: Count as defense tokens; redeployed after conquest like race tokens; removed when race goes in decline.
- **Leader Capture**: If a Leader is in a conquered region, opponent captures it. Ransom of 1 coin returns it. Uncaptured Leaders at game end are worth 2 coins.
