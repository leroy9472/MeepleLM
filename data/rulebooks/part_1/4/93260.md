# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The object of Summoner Wars is to destroy your opponent's Summoner. Each player assumes the role of a Summoner commanding an army of Champions, Common Units, and special abilities to achieve victory.

## 2. Components
- Faction decks (Summoner, Champions, Commons, Events)
- Battlefield grid
- Wound markers
- Magic Pile (face-down cards used for summoning)
- Draw Pile
- Discard Pile
- Wall cards
- Special unit types: Vine Walls, Ice Walls, Conjurations, Mutations

## 3. Setup
1. Each player chooses a faction deck and places their Starting Setup units on the battlefield as indicated on their Reference card.
2. Shuffle remaining cards to form Draw Pile.
3. Players start with no cards in hand.
4. Roll a die; highest roller chooses who takes first turn (first player skips phases 1-3 and can only move up to two units in their first Movement Phase).

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each player's turn consists of six phases:
1. **Draw Phase**: Draw cards until you have 5 cards in hand (if possible).
2. **Summon Phase**: Spend Magic Points (by discarding cards from Magic Pile) to summon Units from your hand to empty spaces adjacent to Walls you control.
3. **Event Phase**: Play any number of Event cards (including Wall cards).
4. **Movement Phase**: Move up to 3 of your Units (each up to 2 spaces orthogonally).
5. **Attack Phase**: Attack with up to 3 of your Units.
6. **Build Magic Phase**: Place any number of cards from your hand face down on top of your Magic Pile.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Movement
- Adjacency is orthogonal (not diagonal).
- Units may move up to 2 spaces orthogonally.
- A Unit may only move once per Movement Phase.
- Units may only move into unoccupied spaces.

### Attacking
- Units with Sword symbol attack adjacent cards.
- Units with Bow symbol attack up to 3 spaces away in straight line (line of sight required).
- Roll dice equal to Attack Value; hits on 3+.
- Place Wound markers for each hit.
- If Wound markers ≥ Life Points, Unit is destroyed and placed face down on attacker's Magic Pile.

### Special Rules
- **Walls**: Not Units; can be attacked/destroyed; destroyed Walls go to owner's discard.
- **Vine Walls**: Special Wall type; can be placed under Units; Units moving off roll die (1-3: receive Wound, cannot move away).
- **Cards Under Units**: Move with the Unit; when destroyed, all cards go to destroyer's Magic Pile.
- **Magic Pile**: Public knowledge of size; cards can be looked at but not rearranged.
- **Special Abilities**: Not optional unless specified; abilities of same name don't stack; multiple Events can stack.
- **Timing**: Player whose turn it is determines resolution order when multiple effects trigger simultaneously.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- Victory is achieved by destroying the opponent's Summoner.
- Game ends immediately when a Summoner is destroyed.
- In team play (3-4 players), when a Summoner is destroyed, that player is out and their Magic Pile is transferred to their teammate.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Summon Cost 0**: Units can be summoned without discarding from Magic Pile.
- **Event Cards**: Can be played one at a time and resolved immediately.
- **Wall Cards**: Placed on empty spaces on your side of the battlefield.
- **Line of Sight**: Blocked by any unit in the path.
- **Special Ability Limits**: Once per turn abilities can only be used once per turn, even if conditions are met multiple times.
- **Team Play**: Players on same team may show each other hands; Magic Piles can be shared during Build Magic Phase.
