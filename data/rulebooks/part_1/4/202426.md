## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Nine alien species unite during the Confluence to build a shared society. Though committed to cooperation, each species seeks to shape the society around their own ideals. The game simulates aggressive collaboration: players earn victory points primarily by inventing technologies, which benefit all players but grant the inventor bonus points. The player with the most victory points after six turns wins.

2. Components  
- 9 Player Screens (hide VPs and ships during bidding)  
- 9 Species Decks (player-specific cards)  
- 40 Colony Cards (front: un-terraformed, back: terraformed)  
- 41 Technology/Research Team Cards (era I–IV)  
- 12 Confluence Cards (Sharing Bonus, turn 1–6)  
- Resource Cubes:  
  - Small: Green (Food), White (Culture), Brown (Industry)  
  - Large: Black (Information), Blue (Biotechnology), Yellow (Power), Gray (Wild)  
  - Ultratech (Octagons)  
- Ship Tokens (various denominations)  
- Victory Point Tokens (1, 2, 5, 10)  
- Species-specific components (e.g., Faderan Acknowledgment Tokens, Kjas Tiles, Zeth Envoy Tokens)  
- Colony and Research Team Bid Tracks (player-count specific)  
- Donation Cards (one per player)  

3. Setup  
- Select Species: Each player chooses a species. Use species boards to determine Colony Support and Tiebreaker values.  
- Player Setup:  
  - Take species screen, ship tokens, and all cards with species background.  
  - Draw starting cards, colonies, research teams, resources, and ships as listed on the Starting Card.  
  - Flip Starting Card to reveal Colony Support, Tiebreaker, and special abilities.  
  - Place starting cards in play.  
- Shared Setup:  
  - Colony Deck: Shuffle face-up with non-upgraded (front) side up. Deal one card per space on Colony Bid Track (lowest to highest bid).  
  - Technology Deck: Divide into eras I–IV, shuffle each era separately, stack in order (I on top, IV on bottom), research team side up. Deal one card per space on Research Team Bid Track.  
  - Confluence Stack: Select six Confluence cards matching player count. Splay with Turn 1 on top.  
- Kjasjavikalimm Rule: If Kjas is in play, use Colony Bid Track for +1 player.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each of the six turns consists of three phases, played simultaneously by all players:

1. Trade Phase  
   - Negotiate and execute trades of resources, ships, cards, and binding promises (VPs cannot be traded, except donation VPs).  
   - Multilateral trades are allowed. All agreements are binding.  
   - Run violet (purple) converters once per turn:  
     - Invent technologies (via Research Team cards).  
     - Upgrade cards (via converter or card cost).  
     - Put new cards into play (e.g., fleets, computer worlds, colonies).  
   - Cards with a player’s background may be loaned (returned at turn end); others are permanently traded.  

2. Economy Phase  
   - No negotiation or trading allowed.  
   - Check Colony Support: Discard excess colonies to the bottom of the Colony Deck.  
   - Run white converters simultaneously:  
     - Place input resources on converters.  
     - Take output resources from supply.  
     - Return inputs to supply.  
     - Output of one converter cannot feed another in the same phase.  
   - Donation outputs (indicated by dashed border or hand icon) go to Donation Card. Must be gifted/traded in next Trade Phase. In final Economy Phase, keep donation outputs.  

3. Confluence Phase  
   - Share Technologies:  
     - Inventors reveal invented techs (face down, then splayed).  
     - Inventor gains VP equal to current Sharing Bonus per tech.  
     - All other players take matching tech card from their deck and put into play.  
     - Era IV techs are not shared (others don’t get the card), but inventor still gains Sharing Bonus.  
   - Bidding:  
     - Announce ship count.  
     - Secretly assign ships: one bid in each hand (colony and research), rest behind screen.  
     - Reveal colony bids; resolve highest to lowest:  
       - Pay full bid to buy one colony with minimum bid ≤ your bid.  
       - May pass and keep ships.  
     - Reveal research team bids; resolve similarly.  
     - Tiebreakers:  
       1. Fewest cards of type being bid (colonies or research teams).  
       2. Highest species Tiebreaker number.  
   - Cleanup:  
     - Discard all cards in "1" bid spaces to bottom of respective decks.  
     - Slide remaining cards left; refill empty spaces from top of deck.  
     - Return loaned cards to owners.  
     - Flip current Confluence card and add to splay of shared technologies.  
   - Proceed to next Trade Phase.  
   - No Confluence Phase on Turn 6.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Converters:  
  - Violet (purple): Run in Trade Phase. Used for upgrades, inventions, and putting cards into play.  
  - White: Run in Economy Phase. Produce resources. Run simultaneously.  
- Trading:  
  - Almost all components tradeable (except VPs).  
  - Binding promises across turns are enforceable.  
  - Penalties for broken deals: 2 VP loss per card/octagon/point; 1 VP loss per cube/ship.  
- Upgrading Cards:  
  - Two methods:  
    1. Run violet converter (pay input).  
    2. Spend prerequisite card (place under upgraded card).  
  - Upgraded card is flipped; prerequisite card is removed from play.  
- Inventing Technology:  
  - Pay input cost on Research Team card during Trade Phase.  
  - Gain listed VP; flip card to "Patent" side.  
  - Take matching Technology card from species deck and put into play.  
  - In Confluence Phase, gain Sharing Bonus VP per invented tech.  
- Donation Mechanic:  
  - Donation outputs (resources, ships, VP) go to Donation Card.  
  - Must be gifted/traded away in next Trade Phase.  
  - Final Economy Phase: keep all donation outputs.  
- Colony Deck: Never shuffled. Discarded colonies go to bottom in order discarded.  
- Species-Specific Mechanics (examples):  
  - Kt’Zr’Kt’Rtl: Infinite Colony Tiebreaker; can play Nullspace Colonies for 1–2 Yellow.  
  - Yengii: May license techs individually instead of sharing; reduced Sharing Bonus.  
  - Zeth: May steal resources from players who didn’t trade with them last Trade Phase.  
  - Faderan: Can spend 4 White + Ice Colony to draw a Relic World.  
  - Im’dril: Need Fleet cards (cost resources) to run converters.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after Economy Phase of Turn 6. No Confluence Phase.  
- Final Scoring:  
  - Hidden VPs earned during game.  
  - Endgame resource scoring:  
    - ½ VP per Ultratech (octagon)  
    - ½ VP per 2 Large Cubes (Black, Blue, Yellow, Gray)  
    - ½ VP per 3 Small Cubes (Brown, Green, White, Gray)  
    - ½ VP per 3 Ships  
  - Donation outputs in final Economy Phase are kept and scored.  
- Total all VPs. Highest score wins. No tiebreaker.  
- Precise Scoring (alternative):  
  - Octagon: 6/12 VP  
  - Large Cube: 3/12 VP  
  - Small Cube: 2/12 VP  
  - Ship: 2/12 VP  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I trade cards with my species border?  
  Yes, but they are loaned and must be returned at end of turn.  
- What happens if I can’t fulfill a trade?  
  Offer compensation acceptable to all parties. If not agreed, fulfill as much as possible and lose 2 VP per card/octagon/point, 1 VP per cube/ship.  
- Can I use donation outputs during the Economy Phase they’re produced?  
  No. Donation outputs go to Donation Card and cannot be used as inputs.  
- Do I have to bid ships?  
  No. Bidding zero is allowed.  
- Can I run a converter that requires a colony input?  
  Yes. Discard a colony of matching climate to bottom of deck.  
- What happens to Era IV techs?  
  Inventor gains Sharing Bonus, but other players do not receive the tech card.  
- Can I exceed Colony Support during Confluence Phase?  
  Yes. Check only at start of Economy Phase. Excess must be discarded then.  
- Are wild resources (Unity gray cubes) tradeable?  
  Yes. They can substitute for any resource of matching size.
