### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Nemo's War*, you play as Captain Nemo aboard the Nautilus, navigating the world's oceans circa 1870. Your voyage is driven by a chosen Motive (e.g., Science, Explore, Anti-Imperialism, War!), which shapes your actions and scoring. The objective is to survive for approximately one year of in-game time, avoid defeat, and maximize Victory Points (VPs) by sinking ships, inciting uprisings, discovering treasures, and completing scientific endeavors.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Event Phase**: Reveal top card of Draw Pile and resolve.
2. **Placement Phase**: Roll dice (based on Act). Use white dice differential for Action Points. Place Ships per die results.
3. **Action Phase**: Spend Action Points on Actions (Adventure, Attack, Move, Incite, Rest, Repair, Refit, Search).
4. **Repeat** until game ends.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Action Points (AP)**: Gained from differential of two white dice. Max 5; save 1 between turns. Lull Turns grant 0 AP but reduce 2-AP Actions to 1 AP.
- **Tests**: Roll 2d6, add modifiers, compare to target. ≥ passes, < fails. Natural 2 always fails.
- **Dice Roll Modifiers (DRMs)**:
  - -1 if revealed Warship in same Ocean.
  - +X from Exerting Ship Resources (Nemo, Crew, Hull).
  - +X from spending Treasure (1 per TEST).
  - +X from cards.
- **Exerting Ship Resources**: Move marker ½ right for DRM. If PASS, reclaim. If FAIL, lose 1 (if lowest die 1) or 2 (otherwise) of each Exerted resource.
- **Emergency Help**: After roll, Sacrifice Characters or Destroy Upgrades to alter outcome.
- **Lull Turn**: Triggered by doubles on two white dice. Place Ships with white dice only. Add gemstone to doubles Ocean and Adventure Deck. Check for Uprising suppression.
- **Combat**:
  - **Warship Attacks First**: Roll 2d6 vs. Attack Strength. Natural 2 = 1d6 Hits. Hits cause random Ship Resource loss.
  - **Nautilus Attacks**: Roll 2d6 vs. Defense Strength. DRMs apply. Natural 2 = disaster (fail, +2 Notoriety, lose 2 Exerted resources).
  - **Disposing of Sunk Ships**: Gain Notoriety. Choose Tonnage (score VP) or Salvage (1 point toward Upgrade).
- **Notoriety**: Gains trigger reinforcements (Blue at 14, Green at 26), Warship upgrades (at 36), and additional black die (at 44). Reaching Motive threshold causes defeat.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Game Ends If**:
1. Any Ship Resource (Nemo, Crew, Hull) reaches end.
2. Notoriety reaches Motive threshold (Science 26, Explore 36, Anti-Imperialism 44, War! 51).
3. All Oceans full when Warship placement required (Imperialist Victory).
4. Finale card is resolved.

**Scoring (if Finale)**:
- **Regular Points (Motive-adjusted)**:
  - Sinking Ships: Tonnage track (Warship and Non-Warship separate).
  - Adventure Cards: In PASS Pile.
  - Collected Treasures: In Collected Treasure box or Tableau.
  - Liberation: Uprising cubes on map.
  - Science: PASS cards, certain ships, Hull condition, Aronnax.
  - Wonders: Treasure, cards, Nemo's health, sunken ships.
- **Bonus/Penalty Points**:
  - Surviving Characters Bonus.
  - Scouring the Seas: VP of rightmost full Tonnage column.
  - Ship Resources Penalty: Based on end condition of Nemo, Crew, Hull.

**Level of Victory**:
- <185: Defeat
- 185–219: Failure
- 220–249: Inconsequential
