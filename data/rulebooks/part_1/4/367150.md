## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Dune: War for Arrakis*, two factions—Atreides (with Fremen ally) and Harkonnens (with Corrino ally)—compete for control of Arrakis. The Atreides seek to fulfill a secret objective tied to advancing their Prescience across three tracks (Kwisatz Haderach, Sand Dwellers, Jihad), while the Harkonnens aim to accumulate Supremacy points by destroying Sietches and managing spice. Victory is achieved through strategic dominance, resource control, and tactical warfare.

**Victory Conditions:**  
- **Atreides:** Win immediately if, at any time, their three Prescience markers meet or exceed the values on their hidden Secret Objective card (checked after destroying Arrakeen or at end of round).  
- **Harkonnens:** Win immediately if the Supremacy marker reaches the end of the track (step 10).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Movement  
- Move Legions to adjacent free areas (no enemy units, settlements, sandworms).  
- **Stacking Limit:** 6 Units per area (Leaders don’t count).  
- **Sandriding (Atreides):** Move through any number of Wormsign/Sandworm areas; final area may have Wormsign but not Sandworm.  
- **Troop-Transport (Harkonnen):** Remove connected Ornithopter to move 2 areas, ignoring obstacles.  
- **Superior Troop-Transport (TSG):** Remove Space Frigate to move 3 areas.  

#### Combat  
- **Target:** Adjacent enemy Legion or undefended Sietch/Settlement.  
- **Battle Sequence:**  
  1. **Dice Poll:**  
     - Attacker rolls units + 1 (Surprise Attack, Leadership action).  
     - Defender rolls units + Settlement rank.  
     - Max 6 dice. Discard Planning cards for +1 die each.  
  2. **Combat Roll:**  
     - Each ⚄ = 1 hit  
     - Each ① = cancels 1 hit  
     - **Leaders:**  
       - Generic: 1 ⚄ = 1 ⚄  
       - Named: Use bottom ability (e.g., Paul: 1 ⚄ = 2 ⚄)  
     - **Sardaukar/Fedaykin:** Cancel 1 ⚄ from opponent before casualties.  
  3. **Remove Casualties:**  
     - Remove 1 Unit/Leader or replace Elite with Regular.  
     - Must remove all hits.  
  4. **Continue/Retreat:**  
     - Attacker may continue (must take 1 hit if attacking Settlement).  
     - Defender may retreat (opponent chooses destination; cannot retreat to Wormsign if Harkonnen).  
- **End of Battle:**  
  - Attacker wins if defender retreats or is destroyed.  
  - Can advance into area (destroying Settlement if present).  

#### Regeneration Tank  
- Named Leader removed → place on leftmost slot.  
- Each time player spends Action die, all figures in tank move 1 right.  
- When moved off rightmost slot, leader returns to play.  

#### Prescience & Supremacy  
- **Prescience Advancement:**  
  - Claim Prescience card: advance markers as shown.  
  - Take Ecological Station: advance matching marker 1.  
  - Destroy Harkonnen Settlement: all markers advance by rank (Arrakeen=3, Carthag=2, Pyon=1).  
- **Supremacy Advancement:**  
  - Destroy Sietch: gain points equal to rank.  
  - Spend 3 spice (if ≤5 points) to gain 1 point.  
  - Reach 10 → Harkonnen wins.  

#### Special Rules  
- **Family Atomics:** When any Prescience marker ≥8, detonate as free action. Choose area to convert Mountain → Desert, enabling Sandworms and Coriolis.  
- **Wild Maker:** Play Shai-Hulud card → place Wild Maker (attacks with 6 dice). Can be kept or replaced with normal Sandworm at end of round.  
- **Bene Gesserit Tokens:** Can be used as 1 Action die (max 1 per round). Gained via Supremacy track or card effects.  
- **Smugglers:** Ally when any Prescience marker ≥ Staban Tuek. Gain Smugglers Action Die and base.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

- **Harkonnen Wins:** Supremacy marker reaches 10.  
- Game ends immediately upon victory.  

---

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Ties in Combat Power:** Use tiebreaker: Generic Leader=1, Regular/Named=2, Elite=3, Sardaukar/Fedaykin=4.  
- **Multiple Leaders in Combat:** Attacker chooses which leader abilities to apply if more results than leaders.  
- **Desert Power Action:** Available if Atreides has fewer unused dice than Harkonnen. Can place 2 Wormsigns, move 2 Sandworms, or attack with 1 Sandworm.  
- **Named Leader Replacement:** At End of Round, may replace on-board Named Leaders with Generic (refreshes special actions).  
- **Planning Card Limits:** Decks not reshuffled unless specified (e.g., Harkonnen solo mode).  
- **Simultaneous Movement:** All figures in one action move at once; no figure moves twice.
