### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Choose Action**: As a group, decide whether to:
   - Travel to a new location
   - Interrogate a character
   - Search a scene for clues
   - Call a forensic contact

2. **Scan QR Code**: Use the app to scan the corresponding card or board.

3. **Progress Story**: The app narrates events, reveals information, and may prompt discovery of new locations, characters, or items.

4. **Manage Time**: Every action consumes in-game time:
   - Scanning items, interrogations, or searches: +5 minutes
   - Traveling between locations: +20 minutes

5. **Discover New Elements**:
   - **Locations**: Placed on one of 7 Location slots
   - **Characters**: Assigned to a specific location or placed in Unlocated Characters slots if unknown
   - **Special Items**: Immediately placed on the Evidence Board when revealed
   - **Evidence Category Cards**: Only placed on the board if confirmed as relevant after scanning

6. **Search for Evidence**:
   - At crime scenes, press “SEARCH THE SCENE” in the app.
   - Choose panoramic view or 3D (with VR glasses).
   - One player observes the scene for 40 seconds and describes what they see.
   - Other players select potential Evidence Category Cards that match observations.
   - Scan all selected cards—the app confirms which are actual clues (place on board) and which are not (return to pile).

7. **Interrogate Characters**:
   - Scan a Character Card to begin interrogation.
   - During interrogation, scan other Character or Evidence cards to ask about them.
   - **Important**: Scanning a Location Card during interrogation ends the session and moves the team there.
   - Exit early with the “GOODBYE” button.

8. **Call Forensic Contacts**:
   - Scan a Forensic Contact Card (Doctor, Scientist, Hacker, Criminologist).
   - While on the call, scanning any relevant card prompts the contact to comment.
   - End call with “GOODBYE” button.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
**Q: What happens if scanning fails?**  
A: Ensure:
- Good lighting (avoid sharp shadows)
- Clean camera lens
- No glare from sleeved cards
- QR code fully inside scan frame
- Phone held steady

Try passing your hand in front of the camera to reset focus.

**Q: Can I ask a character about locations?**  
A: No. Scanning a Location Card during interrogation ends the session and moves the team there.

**Q: What do I do with non-clue Evidence Category Cards?**  
A: Return them to the pile. They may become relevant later.

**Q: Can multiple players search the same scene?**  
A: Yes. After the initial 40-second search, another player can search again—but each attempt costs in-game time.

**Q: Are previous episodes important?**  
A: Some scenarios have connected episodes. Playing with the same group is recommended for continuity.
