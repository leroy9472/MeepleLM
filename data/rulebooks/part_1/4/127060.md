5. Core Mechanics  

Phase A: Roll & Place Dice  
- All players roll 3 dice simultaneously.  
- In turn order, each player places one die on an action tile and performs the action.  
- Die value must be **lower** than the lowest die already on that tile. Exceptions:  
  - Fishing: Any die value may be placed.  
  - Blue God card: Allows die equal to or greater than existing die.  
  - White God card: Treats die as “6” for placement, but does not change pip value.  
- Orange tiles (gained from rolling duplicates): Can be spent to adjust die value by ±1 per tile (e.g., turn 3 into 4 or 2).  

Actions:  
- Expand (Land or Water):  
  - Move Hut from player board to adjacent region via land (brown) or water (blue) path.  
  - Die value = max path number usable.  
  - Place Hut on Building space; displace opponent’s Hut (if any) into region.  
  - Take Building material or Offering.  
  - Use Red God card to score Fish tile VP immediately (once per region).  
- Draft Man / Woman / Man or Woman:  
  - Take tile with value ≤ die value.  
  - Place on free space on player board (must have uncovered green checkmark).  
- Helper: Spend die pips for effects (1 pip = 1 effect unless noted):  
  - 1:1 — Tattooing (shift Man down, advance Status track)  
  - 1:1 — Shell collecting (shift Woman down, gain shells shown)  
  - 1:1 — Gain 1 VP  
  - 2:1 — Gain 1 Offering  
  - 2:1 — Gain 1 God card (draw or face-up)  
  - 2:1 — Gain 1 Building material (place on matching Ceremony space or next to board)  
  - 2:1 — Move 1 Hut to 12th space on player board  
- Temple:  
  - Place Priest on space ≤ die value.  
  - Shift existing Priests right; Priest falling off returns to owner.  
  - Gain Fire Bonus.  
- Build:  
  - Remove 2 adjacent Building materials from Ceremony spaces.  
  - Place Building tile (≤ die value) over them (dice-side down).  
  - Score VP: 10 (R1–2), 7 (R3–4), 4 (R5–6).  
  - Gain Fire Bonus.  
- Fishing:  
  - Place any die; gain 2 VP immediately.  

Fire Bonus (gained from Temple or Build):  
Choose:  
- 1 God card **or** 1 Offering  
AND  
- Advance 1 space on Status track **or** gain 1 Shell  

Phase B: Use Man/Woman Actions  
- In turn order, each player may use **1 Man** and **1 Woman** action.  
- If multiple identical Man or Woman tiles are present, they can be combined for stronger effect (e.g., 2 shell-collecting Women = collect 2× shells).  
- Cannot combine Men and Women.  
- Green God card: Either double one Man/Woman action **or** perform an additional Man/Woman action.  

Phase C: Scoring & Reordering  
1. Status Track:  
- Score VP based on current position (0–15 VP).  
- Return all markers to “0”, stacking in order (highest on top).  
- Reassign turn order: top = 1st, bottom = last.  
2. Temple:  
- Score VP per Priest:  
  - Rounds 1–2: 1 VP each  
  - Rounds 3–4: 2 VP each  
  - Rounds 5–6: 3 VP each  
- Player with most Priests gains top God tile (tie: leftmost Priest wins).  
3. Jewelry:  
- In new turn order, each player may buy 1 Jewelry tile from current round’s column (pay shells).  
- Place face-down on player board.  
- Unbought Jewelry tiles discarded.  
4. Task Tiles:  
- In new turn order, each player completes 1 Task tile:  
  - 6 VP if completed normally  
  - 4 VP if using Yellow God card (reduces requirement by 1)  
  - 0 VP if unable to complete; return one Task tile to box  
- Then draw a new Task tile in turn order.  

RESET Phase  
- Discard 2 unchosen Task tiles and unused Man/Woman tiles.  
- Add 6 new Man and 6 new Woman tiles to board.  
- Add (#players + 2) new dark green Task tiles to board.  
- Return dice to players.  
- Begin next round.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
After Round 6 RESET:  
- Each player may complete **all 3 remaining Task tiles** (each with option to use Yellow God for -1 requirement, scoring 4 VP).  

Final Scoring:  
- 2 VP per unused God tile  
- 1–6 VP per Fish tile: if player has Hut on Building space adjacent to Fish tile  
- 1–9 VP per Jewelry tile (face value)  
- 6 VP for each of the following:  
  - Completed 9 Task tiles  
  - Claimed 6 Jewelry tiles  
  - Filled all 12 Ceremony spaces (with Building materials and/or Building tiles)  
  - Built all 6 Building tiles  
  - Placed Huts in all 12 Regions  
  - Filled all 12 Man/Woman spaces on player board  

Total all VP. Highest score wins. Tie: player earliest in last Phase C turn order wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I use a God tile instead of a God card for task requirements?  
  A: No. Task tiles requiring God cards cannot be fulfilled with God tiles.  
- Q: Can I combine Man and Woman tiles in Phase B?  
  A: No. Only identical gender tiles can be combined.  
- Q: Can I use multiple Green God cards in Phase B?  
  A: No. Only one Green God may be used per Phase B.  
- Q: Can I place a die equal to existing die without Blue God?  
  A: No. Must be strictly lower unless using Blue God.  
- Q: Can I score a Fish tile more than once?  
  A: No. Immediate scoring (with Red God) is one-time. Final scoring is separate.  
- Q: Can I use Orange tiles to turn a 6 into a 1?  
  A: No. Orange tiles adjust by ±1 only. 6 → 5 or 6 → 1 not allowed.  
- Q: What if no Jewelry tile is available in current column?  
  A: Player may not buy; skipped.
