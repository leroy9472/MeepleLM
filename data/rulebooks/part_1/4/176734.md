  - 2nd: $1, 3rd: $2, 4th: $3, 5th: $4  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn is either **Work** or **Generate**, with restrictions:  
- If you have no Workers, you **must Generate**.  
- If you Generated last turn, you **must Work**.  

#### Work Turn  
1. **Place 1 Worker**  
   - Place 1 Worker (and possibly Energy) on one of 13 main board locations.  
   - Must have resources to pay action cost (if any).  
   - Must form the **tallest stack**. If occupied, stack Energy beneath Worker to exceed previous height.  
   - Can boost with extra Energy, but only 1 Worker per stack.  
   - Can reuse your own location with a new stack.  
   - After placement, carry out the action.  

2. **Activate Structures and/or Nation Card**  
   - May activate **any number** of your Structures of the **same type** as the location used (Government, Industry, Commerce).  
   - Structures have action planks:  
     - Single Plank: 1 Worker or 1 Energy  
     - Double Plank: 2 Workers, 2 Energy, or 1 of each  
     - Two Single Planks: Can activate once per turn  
   - Must have resources to pay costs (if any).  
   - May **also** activate your **Nation Card** (any Work turn), spending resources to advance on UN Track.  

#### Generate Turn  
1. **Claim Achievement (optional)**  
   - If you have ≥2 total Workers + Energy on your mat, you may take 1 face-up Achievement tile.  
   - Maximum 5 Achievements. If 6th is taken, discard one to the box.  

2. **Return Workers & Discard Energy**  
   - Return all Workers (from board and Structures) to your mat.  
   - Discard **all** Energy (from board, Structures, and mat).  

3. **Refine Oil (optional)**  
   - Discard up to 4 Oil barrels. Gain 1 temporary **Brown Petroleum Die** per barrel (max 4).  

4. **Roll Energy Dice**  
   - Roll any number of your **Energy Dice** (including temporary Brown dice).  
   - Gain Energy = total number of Energy symbols rolled.  

5. **Pollute**  
   - Look at die with **highest number** (choose if tied):  
     - **Green or Blue Die**: No pollution. Remove 1 token from leftmost Global Impact stack and discard.  
     - **Black or Brown Die**: Place 1 Pollution token (Pollution-side up) in any unpolluted space of your Environment.  
     - **Yellow Die**: Place 1 Pollution token (Nuclear Contamination-side up) in any unpolluted space.  
   - If no dice rolled, discard 1 pollution token as above.  
   - Return Brown dice to supply; other dice to your mat.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Worker Placement**: Must place tallest stack. Can be blocked.  
- **Energy**: Used to boost worker stacks or activate Structures. Discarded on Generate.  
- **Pollution**: Gained from dice rolls, Structure purchases, actions (e.g., Chemistry, Education).  
- **Environment Board**:  
  - 3 rows: Air, Forest, Ocean. 5 columns.  
  - 1 token per space. Once placed, cannot be moved.  
  - Oil Wells: Only in spaces with drilling symbol (4 total).  
  - Cleanup: Remove 1 Pollution, remove 1 Oil Well, or flip 1 Nuclear to Pollution.  
- **Global Impact Track**:  
  - When a pollution stack is emptied, trigger Global Impact:  
    1. Score 1 VP per clean space in specified Environment row.  
    2. Reset specified Structure market (discard and refill).  
    3. Apply special effect (immediate or persistent).  
  - Oil price = value under leftmost non-empty stack (per 3 barrels).  
- **United Nations Track**:  
  - Advance via Nation Card.  
  - Final score = space position.  
  - Leader bonus: +3 VP to furthest player (split if tied, round down).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Game Trigger**: When last pollution token is removed from the **rightmost** stack of the Global Impact Track.  
- After current turn ends, **all players take one final turn** (Work or Generate).  
- During final turns:  
  - Oil price fixed at $5 per 3 barrels.  
  - Pollution gained comes from general supply (not Global Impact Track).  

**Final Scoring (add to in-game VP):**  
- **Structures**: Sum VP values on owned cards.  
- **Energy Dice**: 2 VP per die on mat (excludes temporary Brown dice).  
- **United Nations Track**: VP = space occupied. +3 VP to furthest player (split if tied, round down).  
- **Achievements**: Reveal all. Each worth up to 5 VP (maximum, even if condition yields more).  
- **Environment**:  
  - 1 VP per **unpolluted space**.  
  - Column bonuses: 3 VP (3rd), 4 VP (4th), 5 VP (5th) if entire column unpolluted.  

**Winner**: Most VP.  
**Tiebreaker**: Remaining resources:  
($ ÷ 2, rounded down) + Plastic + Steel + Science + Oil  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can I use a resource gained from a location to pay for it?** Yes (e.g., gain Plastic from Global Impact and use it to buy a Structure).  
- **Can I use temporary Brown dice for anything besides energy?** No. Only for rolling in Generate phase.
