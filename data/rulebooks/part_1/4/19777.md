# Indonesia — Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Indonesia is an economic strategy game in which 2–5 players build and manage production and shipping companies across the Indonesian archipelago over three eras (A, B, C). Players earn money by operating companies, transporting goods to cities, and investing in research and development. The game ends when Era C concludes. The player with the most money—cash on hand, including money in the bank—wins. Ties are broken in favor of the player earliest in turn order.

## 3. Setup
1. Place the board in the center.
2. Each player receives:
   - 100 rupiah (kept secret unless otherwise agreed)
   - 1 player aid
   - 1 set of wooden markers (in their color)
   - 1 randomly dealt city card from each era (A, B, C), kept face down
3. Place Era A company deeds on their designated provinces on the map.
4. Shuffle Era B and C company deeds and place them near the board.
5. Each player places one marker on the first space of each R&D track.
6. Randomly determine starting player order; place markers on the turn order track.
7. Agree whether money is public or private (default: private).

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game year consists of 7 phases, played in order:

### 1. New Era
- Begins the game and triggers when:
  - No company deeds remain from the previous era, or
  - Only one type of company deed remains.
- **Action:** In turn order, each player places one new city (Level 1, green) in any of the three provinces listed on their current-era city card.
  - Cities must be placed on a coastal land area.
  - Each province may contain only one city.
  - If no valid location exists, the player discards their city card and passes.
- After all players act, discard all unacquired company deeds from the previous era and place the next era’s deeds on the board.
- Game ends if this phase occurs at the end of Era C.

### 2. Bid for Turn Order
- Using the current turn order, each player makes one bid (0 allowed).
- Bids are placed in the “Bank” box on the player aid and are permanently removed from circulation but count toward final scoring.
- Turn order is recalculated: highest bidder first, then descending.
- In case of a tie, original relative order is preserved.
- Bid amounts are multiplied by the player’s “Turn Order Bid” R&D level (must use if researched).

### 3. Mergers
- Players may announce mergers in multiple rounds. Phase ends when all players pass consecutively.
- **Announcing a Merger:**
  - Player must have researched “Mergers” R&D (level ≥ number of deeds in merged company).
  - May only merge two companies.
  - Announcer must either own one merging company or have a free “Slot.”
  - Each company deed may merge only once per year.
- **Bidding:**
  - Announcer makes first bid (≥ nominal value).
  - Nominal value = sum of goods/ships × value per good (Rice 20, Spice 25, Rubber 30, Oil 40, Ship 10, Siap faji 35).
  - Bidding proceeds in turn order; raises must be in multiples of the total number of goods/ships involved.
  - Players with a free slot or ownership in merging companies may bid.
  - Once a player passes, they cannot rejoin.
- **Resolving:**
  - Winning bidder gains control of the merged company.
  - Total bid is distributed proportionally to former owners based on goods/ships contributed.
  - Acquirer must have full bid amount in cash, even if they partially owned the companies.
  - Company deeds are combined into one.
- **Siap faji Mergers:**
  - Only allowed in Era B or C.
  - Merge one rice and one spice company.
  - Nominal bid = total (rice + spice) goods × 25.
  - After merger, new owner removes half the goods (rounded up), starting from borders (no splitting contiguous blocks).
  - Remaining areas are converted to Siap faji goods.
  - Resulting Siap faji company can only later merge with another Siap faji.

### 4. Acquisitions
- In turn order, players may acquire one company deed per round.
- Player must have an open “Slot” (R&D track).
- **Production Company:**
  - Place one good marker in any empty land area within the designated province.
  - Cannot place adjacent to same-type good.
  - If no valid spot, company is discarded.
- **Shipping Company:**
  - Place one ship in any sea area bordering the designated province.
  - Existing ships do not block placement.
- Players may pass; once passed, they cannot act further this phase.
- Phase continues until all pass or no deeds remain.

### 5. Research & Development (R&D)
- In turn order, each player advances one marker on any R&D track by one space.
- Tracks:
  - **Slots:** Max number of companies owned (1–5).
  - **Mergers:** Max deeds in a merger announced by player (1–5).
  - **Hull Player:** Goods each of player’s ships can carry per operation (1–5).
  - **Expansion:** Max areas a company may expand per operation (1–5).
  - **Turn Order Bid:** Multiplier for turn order bids (1–5).
  - **Business Hull:** Not used initially.
- A player may advance another player’s “Hull Player” track instead of their own.

### 6. Operations
- Multiple rounds in turn order. Each player operates one company per round until all have operated.
- Merged companies count as one entity.
- **Operating Shipping Companies:**
  - May choose to expand (optional).
  - May add up to “Expansion” R&D level in ships.
  - Ships must be placed in a sea area where the company already has a ship, or adjacent to one.
  - Max ships per era is on the company deed.
  - Merged shipping companies sum their max ships.
  - Hull capacity per ship = owner’s “Hull Player” level.
  - After operation, flip company deed face down.
- **Operating Production Companies:**
  - Must sell as many goods as possible, even at a loss.
  - Goods sold to cities must be connected via a chain of ships from one shipping company.
  - City capacity: Level 1 = 1 of each good, Level 2 = 2, Level 3 = 3. Demand is per good type, not per company.
  - Owner earns fixed price per good (Rice 20, Spice 25, etc.), minus 5 per ship used.
  - Shipping company owner earns 5 per ship used.
  - After selling:
    - If all goods sold: must expand for free (number of expansions = “Expansion” R&D level).
    - If not all sold: may pay to expand (cost = good’s value per area).
  - Expansions must be adjacent to a production zone of the company.
  - Cannot expand into cities, other companies, or across sea without arrow.
  - Cannot merge production zones of same-type companies.
  - After operation, flip company deed face down.

### 7. City Growth
- Cities grow if they received all goods currently produced on the board up to their capacity:
  - Level 1 → Level 2: 1 of each good
  - Level 2 → Level 3: 2 of each good
- Replace city marker with next level (green → yellow → red).
- If insufficient tokens, no growth occurs.
- If multiple cities qualify but insufficient tokens, first player chooses which grow.
- Discard all delivered goods after this phase.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **R&D Tracks:** Drive capabilities in slots, mergers, hull capacity, expansion, and turn order.
- **Mergers:** Central mechanic for control, income, and game pacing. Enable hostile takeovers and strategic positioning.
- **Shipping:** Essential for production. Hull capacity scales with “Hull Player” level. Ships are permanent once placed.
- **Expansion:** Free after full sales; paid otherwise. Enables blocking and access.
- **City Growth:** Drives demand and income. Growth depends on diversity of goods produced.
- **Turn Order:** Bid-based with multiplier; determines action sequence.
- **Ownership & Control:** Merged companies operate as one. Hull capacity follows owner’s R&D.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends during **New Era** phase when Era C concludes.
- **Final Operations Phase:** All money earned is doubled.
  - Players must keep earnings from this phase separate.
  - If game continues (rare), move to cash at year start.
  - At game end, double the amount and add to cash.
- **Victory:** Player with most total money (cash + bank) wins. Tie goes to earlier turn order.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a company be merged if not started?** No. Only active (acquired) companies may merge.
- **Can a shipping company expand into a sea with its own ship already present?** Yes. Multiple ships of the same company may occupy one sea area.
- **Does a merged shipping company retain original hull capacities?** No. Hull capacity is set by the new owner’s “Hull Player” level.
- **Can you expand a production company across provinces?** Yes, if connected by land or sea arrows.
- **Can two Siap faji companies merge?** Yes, if Mergers R&D allows (e.g., 4 deeds total requires Mergers 4).
- **What if a company can’t ship any goods?** It may still pay to expand, or pass (if no expansion desired).
- **Do ships reset between companies?** Yes. Each production company’s shipping usage is independent.
- **When is the last Operations phase known?** Not always certain—expansion may block a company’s starting area, triggering game end unexpectedly.
