### 1. Lore & Objective

The game simulates the development of psychoanalysis, where players use insights, coffee, and bright ideas to advance their influence and knowledge.

  1. **State Ideas**: Place 1–2 Ideas on Meeting Table to perform an action, then advance Inkpot and resolve its landing space.
  2. **Recall Ideas**: Gain Coffee based on occupied Idea spaces, retrieve Ideas, then claim a Location or District bonus.
  3. **Treat Clients**: Use Dream cards to apply Therapy Points, potentially triggering Catharsis or curing Clients.
- End of turn: Optionally use Heart-Shaped Boxes to treat Clients; then draft new Clients for any empty Office Rooms.
- Game ends when Freud’s Reputation marker reaches the watch icon.
