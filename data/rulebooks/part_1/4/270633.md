## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Aeon's End: The New Age is a cooperative deck-building game where players take on the roles of mages defending the city of Gravehold from powerful Nemeses. The objective is to defeat the Nemesis before the players or Gravehold are destroyed. Players build their decks over time by acquiring more powerful spells, relics, and treasures while managing limited resources like aether and life.

Victory is achieved when:
- The Nemesis has no cards left in its deck and no minions or power cards in play at the end of any turn, or
- The Nemesis has 0 life.

Defeat occurs when:
- All players are exhausted (0 life) — not applicable in solo play, or
- Gravehold reaches 0 life.

2. Components  
- Mage mats and corresponding starting decks (Crystals, Sparks, unique starter cards)  
- Breach tokens (type, position, and rotation as shown on mage mat)  
- Supply cards: Spells, Relics, Gems (used as randomizers)  
- Treasure cards: Level 1, 2, and 3  
- Nemesis deck components:  
  - Nemesis-specific cards (Tier 0–3)  
  - Basic Nemesis cards (upgraded and general)  
  - Nemesis mat with life dial  
- Turn Order deck cards (player and nemesis turn indicators)  
- Aether, charge, pulse, shield, silence, and fire tokens  
- Life dials (player and Gravehold)  
- Player aid cards, knowledge tokens, banished pile section  

3. Setup  
### Supply Setup  
- Randomly select using randomizer cards:  
  - 3 Gems (must include at least one costing 3 aether)  
  - 2 Relics  
  - 4 Spells  
- Arrange into a 3×3 grid (face-up piles).

### Nemesis Setup  
- Choose a Nemesis (intentionally or via randomizer).  
- Check the battle number on the back of its randomizer card (1–4; higher = harder).  
- Set Nemesis life dial according to mat.  
- Separate the 9 Nemesis-specific cards into Tiers 1–3.  
- Add Upgraded Basic Nemesis cards per battle number (see chart below), respecting player count limits:  

| Player Count | Max Basic Nemesis Cards per Tier |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 1            | 2 per tier                     |
| 2            | 3 per tier                     |
| 3            | 4 per tier                     |
| 4            | 5 per tier                     |

- Fill remaining tier slots with general Basic Nemesis cards up to max.  
- Shuffle each tier separately.  
- Stack deck: Tier 1 (top), Tier 2, Tier 3 (bottom).  
- Some Nemeses include Tier 0 cards — place per mat instructions.

### Player Setup  
- Each player chooses a Mage, takes matching mat, player aid, and number token (1, 2, etc.).  
- Build starting deck as shown on mat (leftmost card on top). Place face-down to the left of mat.  
- Place breaches above mat exactly as depicted (type, position, rotation).  
- Set player life to 10. Set Gravehold life to 30.  
- Starting deck includes Crystals and Sparks; may be modified by treasure.

### Treasure Setup (by Battle Level)  
- **Battle 2, 3, or 4**: Randomly choose 5 Level 1 Treasures. Each player takes 1.  
  - If Gem: replace a Crystal (if possible), else replace a Spark.  
  - If Spell: replace a Spark (if possible), else replace a Crystal.  
  - Insert into starting deck in original order.  
- **Battle 3 or 4**: Randomly choose 3 Level 2 Treasures. Players collectively choose 1 as a group treasure (usable by any).  
- **Battle 4**: Randomly choose 5 Level 3 Treasures. Each player takes 1 and places it on their mage mat (owner-only use).  
  - Legacy mages may use equipment effect instead.

### Turn Order Deck  
- Combine:  
  - 2 Nemesis turn cards  
  - 4 player turn cards (e.g., 1/2, 3/4, Wild)  
- Shuffle into face-down deck.  
- Draw one card to determine next turn.  
- Reshuffle when empty.  
- **Solo variant**: Use 3 player cards + 2 nemesis cards. $1/2$ always means player 1.  
- For Wild turn: starting player takes Wild token.  
- For 1/2 and 3/4 turns: first player acts, then second on next draw. Use tokens to track.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Turn order determined by drawing from Turn Order deck.  
- On empty, reshuffle discard into new deck.  
- **Player Turn**:  
  - Draw up to 5 cards.  
  - Gain 2 aether.  
  - May focus breaches, prep spells, cast spells, play cards, gain new cards.  
  - Fire Mage power if fully charged (pay 2 aether to charge).  
  - Discard unplayed cards.  
- **Nemesis Turn (Main Phase)**:  
  - Resolve all Persistent effects.  
  - Remove one power token from each power card.  
  - If last token removed, resolve effect and discard card.  
  - If deck is empty when drawing, Unleash three times instead.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Breaches**:  
  - Closed breaches can be focused to open.  
  - Only one spell may be prepped per breach.  
  - Only one relic may be attached per breach (placed underneath).  
  - Spells can only be prepped to closed breaches if focused this turn.  
  - "+1 damage" breaches add 1 damage to all spell effects, even non-damaging ones.  
- **Casting Spells**:  
  - Discard spell to the **face-up discard pile** of the mage whose breach it was cast from.  
  - Resolve effect.  
  - Echo: effect resolves twice.  
  - Link: two Link spells may share a breach; cast separately.  
- **Card Management**:  
  - Do not shuffle discard pile. Flip entire pile to form new draw pile when needed.  
  - Gained cards go on top of face-up discard pile.  
- **Charging**: Pay 2 aether to gain 1 charge token on mage. Fully charged = use special power.  
- **Conjure**: Look at top card of deck; place it facedown on an open or focused breach. Treated as a spell: cost 2 aether, effect “Cast: Deal 2 Damage”.  
- **Degrade**: When forced, destroy a card costing ≥2 aether, gain a Supply card costing less into hand. If unable, suffer 2 damage.  
- **Destroy**: Card leaves game until next session.  
- **Exhausted Player (0 life)**:  
  - Cannot regain life.  
  - All damage dealt to them is doubled to Gravehold.  
  - Not considered for “lowest life” effects.  
- **Unleash**: Trigger the current Nemesis’s Unleash effect.  
  - If deck empty during draw phase, Unleash three times.  
- **Wandering**: All ability damage reduced to 1. Players may spend any amount of aether during main phase to deal equal damage to a Wandering minion.  
- **Swap**: Some cards swap with another (indicated by arrow). Source from Swap zone, not Supply.  
- **Revealing Cards**: After viewing, return to top of deck in any order.  
- **Silence**: Place token on Minion to cancel next Persistent effect; discard token after.  
- **Shield**: Minions start with shield tokens. Each damage removes one shield instead of life.  
- **Develop**: Move a card from Supply to Develop zone, or from Develop zone to discard pile (can be done by different players).  
- **Recall**: Effect usable only when card is in discard pile.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when:  
  - Nemesis is defeated (0 life or no cards in deck + no minions/powers in play). → Victory  
  - All players exhausted (except in solo) or Gravehold reaches 0 life. → Defeat  

**Expedition Mode Scoring**:  
- After 4 battles, score based on attempts per battle:  
  - 6 points: won on 1st attempt  
  - 4 points: won on 2nd attempt  
  - 2 points: won on 3rd attempt  
  - 0 points: won on 4th or later attempt  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I prep a spell to a breach that’s about to open?**  
  Yes — if you focus the breach this turn, you may prep a spell to it even if it’s currently closed.  
- **What happens when the Turn Order deck runs out?**  
  Reshuffle all discarded turn cards into a new deck.  
- **Can I use a group treasure (Level 2) more than once?**  
  Yes — group treasures are shared and reusable.  
- **Do I shuffle my discard pile during the game?**  
  No — only flip it face-down to form the draw pile when needed. Do not shuffle.  
- **Can I use a Level 3 treasure immediately?**  
  Yes — once placed on your mat, you may use it per its effect.  
- **What if I can't degrade a card?**  
  Suffer 2 damage instead.  
- **Can solo player be targeted as “Ally”?**  
  Yes — in solo, “Any Player” or “Ally” refers to the single player.  
- **What if a breach is destroyed with a prepped spell?**  
  Discard the prepped spell.  
- **Can I charge my mage outside of my turn?**  
  No — charging costs aether and is only allowed during your main phase.
