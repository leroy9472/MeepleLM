### 1. Lore & Objective  
The goal of Bruges is to score the most Victory Points (VP) by building your influence in the city through constructing canals, recruiting people, building houses, and gaining reputation.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 8 rounds (variable with draw pile exhaustion). Each round has 4 phases:

#### Phase 1: Draw Cards  
- Starting with the Start Player and proceeding clockwise, each player draws cards until they have 5 in hand.  
- Players may draw from either Draw Pile.  
- If a pile is exhausted:  
  - Replace it with the Extra Draw Pile → this round is the **final round**.  
  - If the Extra Draw Pile is used during Phase 3 or later, the **next round** is final.  
  - If both piles are gone, split the remaining pile into two.  
- After all players draw, reveal the top Stock Exchange / Market Card and place 5 or 6 Action Markers on it.

#### Phase 2: Roll the Dice  
- Start Player rolls all 5 dice and places them on the board in ascending order.  
- **For each die showing 5 or 6**: each player gains 1 Threat Marker of that die’s color.  
- **For each die showing 3 or 4**: corresponding Boat/Ship is flipped face-up or placed in harbor.  
- **For dice showing 1 or 2**: sum determines cost (in guilders) to advance on Reputation Track.  
  - Players, in turn order, may pay the sum to advance 1 step.  
  - If no 1s or 2s are rolled, no advancement is possible.  

**Threat Penalty Trigger**:  
When a player receives their **third Threat Marker** of the same color, resolve the penalty and return all 3 markers to supply:  
- **Blue (Flood)**: Return all Workers to supply.  
- **Brown (Plague)**: Discard 1 Person from your play area (not hand).  
- **Yellow (Raid)**: Return all Guilders to bank.  
- **Red (Fire)**: Discard 1 built House or 1 built Canal Token.  
  - If discarding an occupied House, return Person to hand.  
  - Cannot create gaps in Canal.  
  - Statue is kept if end piece is removed.  
- **Purple (Intrigue)**: Lose 3 VP (score cannot go below 0).  

#### Phase 3: Action Phase  
- Players take turns clockwise, each playing 1 card per turn to perform 1 action.  
- Each player performs **4 actions**, leaving 1 card in hand.  
- Any of the 6 actions may be taken with any card.  

**Available Actions**:  
1. **Take 2 Workers**  
   - Discard 1 card → gain 2 Workers of the card’s color.  

2. **Take Guilders**  
   - Discard 1 card → gain Guilders equal to the value of the die matching the card’s color.  

3. **Discard 1 Threat Marker & Gain 1 VP**  
   - Discard 1 card → discard 1 Threat Marker of the same color → gain 1 VP.  

4. **Build 1 Canal Token**  
   - Discard 1 card matching the color of the desired Canal space.  
   - Pay the Guilder cost shown on the space.  
   - Place Canal Token on that space.  
   - Must be adjacent to Seal or existing Canal Token.  
   - If you complete a 5-space Canal Section → take the top Statue Token.  
   - If you build on space 3 (in either direction) → score 3 VP at game end.  

5. **Build 1 House**  
   - Play 1 card face-down in front of you.  
   - Pay 1 Worker of the same color as the card.  
   - Each House is worth 1 VP at game end and can hold 1 Person.  

6. **Recruit 1 Person**  
   - Play 1 card on an empty House (color of Person and House do not need to match).  
   - Pay the Guilder cost in top-left corner.  
   - Activate the Person’s ability immediately if it has a “Once” effect.  

**Person Card Activation Types**:  
- **Arrow (→)**: One-time effect, activated immediately upon recruitment.  
- **Worker Symbol**: Activate once per round by discarding 1 Worker of shown color. Rotate card 90° to indicate used.  
- **Infinity (∞)**:  
  - “Once per round”: No cost, rotate after use.  
  - “Whenever” / “Every time”: Automatic, no rotation.  
- **Laurel ( wreath )**: Scores VP at game end based on conditions.  

Players may activate People **before or after** playing a card on their turn.

#### Phase 4: Majority Phase  
- Check for **sole majority** in the following (only one player may qualify per category per round):  
  1. **Reputation**: Furthest on Reputation Track.  
  2. **People**: Most recruited People in play.  
  3. **Canals**: Most Canal Tokens built (total of both sides).  
- If a player has sole majority, they flip their corresponding Majority Marker to colored side.  
- Once flipped, it remains flipped for the rest of the game.  
- Reset all rotated (tapped) Person Cards.  
- Flip all Boats/Ship Tiles face-down.  
- Discard current Stock Exchange / Market Card.  
- Pass Start Player Banner clockwise.  
- Advance Round Marker 1 space on Score Track.  
- If Round Marker reaches 9 or Extra Draw Pile was used, proceed to Final Scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Hand Management**: Players start with 5 cards, play 4 per round, keep 1.  
- **Action Economy**: 4 actions per round, flexible use of cards.  
- **Threat System**: Risk management via dice; 3rd marker triggers penalty.  
- **Majority Bonuses**: Permanent 4 VP bonuses for temporary leads.  
- **Canal Building**: Linear progression from Seal; rewards for space 3 and full sections.  
- **Person Abilities**: Diverse effects with activation rules.  
- **Endgame Trigger**: Draw pile depletion determines final round.

Each player scores:  
1. **Recruited People**: VP shown on each Person card (below cost).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use a Person ability the same turn I recruit them?**  
  Yes, if it’s a Worker or Infinity type. Arrow types activate immediately.

- **Can I discard a canal section that breaks continuity?**  
  No. You cannot leave a gap in a canal.

- **What if I complete a canal, lose the end piece, then rebuild?**  
  You keep the Statue. You do **not** earn a new one upon re-completion.

- **Can multiple players have flipped the same Majority Marker?**  
  Yes. Each who ever held sole majority flips their own.

- **Can I advance on Reputation Track more than once per round?**  
  No. Maximum 1 step per round.

- **What if the Threat Marker supply runs out?**  
  Resolve penalties in player order; returning markers refreshes supply.

- **Can I build a house without a matching worker?**  
  No. You must pay 1 Worker of the same color as the card used.
