# The King is Dead – Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The kingdom is in chaos after the king's death. Three factions—the Scottish, Welsh, and English—vie for control across eight regions of Britain. As a noble powerbroker, your goal is to influence the balance of power so that your preferred faction becomes dominant—or to gather broad support across factions—so you can be crowned the new monarch.

The game ends in one of two ways:
- **French Invasion**: Triggered when 3 Instability Disks are placed. The winner is the player who best unites the factions.
- **Coronation**: Triggered when all 8 regions are resolved. The winner is the player most supported by the most powerful faction.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
1. Players take turns in clockwise order.
2. On your turn, choose:
   - **Play a Card**: Take its action, place it face-up on your discard pile, then summon a follower.
   - **Pass**: Skip your turn. You may pass multiple times.
3. If all players pass in sequence:
   - Resolve a **Power Struggle** in the lowest-numbered face-up region (Contested Region).
   - After resolution, the player after the last to pass takes their turn.
4. Game ends when:
   - 3 Instability Disks are on the board (French Invasion), or
   - All 8 regions are face-down (Coronation).

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Playing a Card
- You have exactly 8 action cards. Each can be used only once.
- Resolve the card’s effect as fully as possible.
- If full effect is impossible, do as much as you can.
- If no part of the effect can be done, play the card to no effect.
- After playing any card (even to no effect), you **must summon a follower**.

### Summoning a Follower
- After playing a card, take **one** follower from **any region** and place it in your court.
- You may not take from the supply.
- You may summon from a region not affected by your action.
- This strengthens your claim over that faction but weakens the faction on the board.

### Power Struggle
Triggered when all players pass in sequence.
1. **Contested Region**: The face-up region card in the lowest-numbered space.
2. **Determine Control**:
   - The faction with the most followers in the region places its Control Disk.
   - If tied (or no followers), place an **Instability Disk**.
3. **Return Followers**: All followers in the region go back to the supply.
4. **Flip Region Card**: Turn it face-down.
5. **Continue Play**: The player after the last to pass takes their turn.

### Action Cards (Base Game)

#### Support Cards (Scottish / Welsh / English)
- Place 2 followers of the named faction into:
  - A region adjacent to a region **they control**, OR
  - If their home region has no disk, adjacent to their **home region**.
- Must place both in the same region.
- If fewer than 2 in supply, place as many as possible.
- No effect if no valid region or no followers.

#### Assemble
- Place 1 Scottish, 1 Welsh, and 1 English follower from supply into any regions (same or different).
- If a faction has no followers in supply, skip that one.
- No effect if no followers of any faction in supply.

#### Negotiate
- Swap positions of any two **face-up** region cards that have **no Negotiation Disk**.
- Place a Negotiation Disk on **one** of the swapped cards.
- No effect if fewer than 2 eligible cards.

#### Manoeuvre
- Swap one follower in any region with one follower in any other region.
- You may swap same-faction followers.
- Must swap if at least one valid swap exists.
- Cannot undo another player’s Manoeuvre unless at least one other action has been taken since.

#### Outmanoeuvre
- Swap one follower with **two followers** in an adjacent region.
- May swap same-faction.
- Must do full swap if possible.

### Cunning Actions (Advanced Game Only)

- **Ambush**: Place 2 Scottish followers in a region, then return 1 follower (any) from that region to supply.
- **March**: Move 2 followers from one region to an adjacent region. Must move both to same region. If can’t move 2, move 1 if possible.
