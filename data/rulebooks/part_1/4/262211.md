# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Cloudspire is a competitive or co-op strategy game where factions vie for control over the islands of Ankara. Players manage resources, deploy units, construct spires, and battle opponents to either destroy their fortress gate or achieve the most powerful fortress after four waves.

**Victory Conditions:**
- Immediate victory: Defeat all but one opposing fortress gate.
- At end of Wave 4: Compare fortress power (gate health + number of fortress advancements).
  - Tiebreakers: Most gate health → Most remaining Source → Most spires.

## 2. Components
- Faction-specific unit and spire tokens (minions, heroes, spires)
- Fortress advancement cards and dice (e.g., Artillery, Assembly, Forsaken)
- Source and CP trackers
- Market cards (mercenaries, spire plans, relics, earthscapes)
- Event cards
- Landmark tokens
- Relic cards
- Earthscape tiles
- Command Point (CP) and Source resources

## 3. Setup
1. Assemble play area with central isle; each player attaches their fortress to an outer isle.
2. Place starting spires per faction rules.
3. Set up market: 1 earthscape + (number of players + 1) market chips.
4. Each player receives starting Source and CP based on wave (Wave 1: 5 Source, 5 CP).
5. Determine first player; proceed clockwise.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each wave follows these phases in turn order:

### 1. Event Phase (skipped in Wave 1)
- Pass first player token left.
- Discard resolved event cards and limited build markers.
- Draw and apply event card.

### 2. Income Phase
- Gain Source:
  - Wave 1: 5 | Wave 2: 7 | Wave 3: 9 | Wave 4: 11
- Repair defeated fortress gate to full (10 health).

### 3. Market Phase
- Refill market if needed.
- Each player takes one turn to make a single purchase:
  - Earthscape: 2 Source (only one per phase)
  - Market chips: cost shown (merc units, spire plans, relics, equipment)
- Purchased merc units may be held beside barracks until deployment.

### 4. Build Phase
Players take turns performing any number of build actions until all pass:
- **Construct a Spire**: On controlled Source Well under influence.
- **Upgrade a Spire**: Pay cost = number of current upgrades. Add Attack/Range/Fortification. Fortification costs 2 Source.
- **Place Earthscape**: Must connect to existing terrain and maintain path between fortresses.
- **Advance Fortress**: Purchase faction-specific advancements.
- **Other Options**: From relics, events, or advancements.

Max spires:
- 2 players: 6 | 3 players: 5 | 4 players: 4

### 5. Prep Phase
- Declare mark (target enemy fortress).
- Simultaneously select units using CP:
  - CP per wave: 5 (W1), 7 (W2), 9 (W3), 11 (W4)
- Form deployment stack (top-down order).
- Group minions (lowest movement on top; transport units require grouping).
- Deploy heroes (max 2; may deploy before/after minions; no CP cost for starting hero in W1).

### 6. Onslaught Phase
In turn order, each player performs:
- **Start of Turn**
  - Trigger start-of-turn effects.
  - Use up to 2 limited build options (construct/upgrade spire).
- **Movement**
  - Move all minions then heroes (or vice versa; one hero can move before and one after).
  - Minions must use full movement and move closer to mark.
  - Leading minion moves first (closest to mark).
  - Heroes may use partial movement.
  - Friendly units swap positions if blocked.
- **Spires Fire**
  - Opposing spires within range attack active player’s units.
  - Roll one die per attack upgrade.
  - Units do not retaliate against spires.
  - Each spire fires once per turn.
- **Exploration**
  - Reveal adjacent landmarks.
- **Attack**
  - Units attack in chosen order.
  - Must attack if valid target is in range (minions); optional for heroes.
  - Valid targets: enemy units, spires, fortress gates.
  - Retaliation occurs once per attacker per turn (except fortress gates, which retaliate every time).
  - Spires do not retaliate.
  - Damage removes health or fortification chips.
  - Destroyed spires return to barracks; destroyed minions return to barracks; defeated heroes and mercs are removed.

### End of Wave
- Campfire Mode: If only one faction has units in play, their heroes become inactive.
- Onslaught ends when all non-friendly units are defeated.
- Proceed to next wave.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Influence
A player has influence over:
- Hexes adjacent to fortress gate.
- Hexes containing their spire.
- Hexes adjacent to a hex group with their spire.
- Fortress Source Wells.

### Terrain
Types: Path, Plains, Forest, Mountains, Water.  
Units without terrain allowance can only move on Path.

### Unit Types
- **Minions**: Bronze border; grouped or ungrouped.
- **Heroes**: Gold border; ungrouped; can return to fortress to heal.
- **Mercenaries**: Purchased from market; deploy at no CP cost.

### Grouping Rules
- Minions stack with lowest movement on top.
- Active unit uses top unit’s stats and talents.
- Health equals top unit’s health.
- When top unit dies, next unit is revealed with full health.
- Damage does not carry over.

### Promotion & Leveling Up
- **Heroes**: Gain upgrades when defeating units/spires. At max capacity on basic side, promote (flip to starred side, lose upgrades, gain health difference).
- **Minions**: Faction-specific promotion (e.g., Brawnen via fortress advancements, Heirs via defeating enemies).

### Special Talents (Selected)
- **Flying**: Can only be attacked by Air Defense or #Range/Flying units.
- **Air Defense**: Can attack Flying units.
- **Range (#)**: Attack and retaliate from up to # hexes away.
- **Assault**: Remove bottom upgrade from spire before dealing damage.
- **Splash**: Deal 1 damage to all adjacent units when attacking.
- **Transport**: Must group with one minion underneath; allows lower movement unit on top.
- **Builder**: Before/after movement, build/upgrade spire at no cost.
- **Raze**: At start of turn, attack spire or fortress gate; removes bottom upgrade after hitting gate.
- **Naroran Rift / Riftwalk**: Teleport units between chips with same talent.
- **Elfin / Roost**: Place or host Elfinkaze units.
- **Forsaken Die**: Roll before movement; apply result (used by Brawnen Forsaken units).

### Pillaging
When defeating a fortress gate (but game continues):
- Gain all of that faction’s Source (up to your capacity).
- Set their Source to 0.

### Gate Repair
After Income Phase, repair gate:
- Sacrifice 1 advancement = +1 health (max 3 health).
- Otherwise, 2 Source = +1 health.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends when:
- Only one fortress gate remains intact → immediate win.
- End of Wave 4 → compare fortress power.

**Fortress Power = Gate Health + Number of Fortress Advancements**

Tiebreakers:
1. Most gate health
2. Most remaining Source
3. Most spires
4. Replay recommended!
