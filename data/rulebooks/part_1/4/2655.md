## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
The objective of Hive is to completely surround your opponent's Queen Bee with pieces (of any color) while protecting your own Queen Bee from being surrounded. The first player to surround their opponent's Queen Bee wins. If both Queen Bees are surrounded simultaneously, the game ends in a draw. A draw may also occur by mutual agreement if a stalemate is unavoidable.

2. **Components**  
Each player has a set of 11 hexagonal insect tiles:  
- 1 Queen Bee  
- 2 Spiders  
- 3 Ants  
- 2 Beetles  
- 3 Grasshoppers  
Additionally, one Mosquito and one Pillbug may be included in expanded versions. All pieces are two-sided and identical per color.

3. **Setup**  
- Players choose a color and place all 11 pieces face-up in their reserve.  
- No physical board is used; the hive forms dynamically on a flat surface.  
- The game begins with White placing any piece (except Queen Bee) on the table.  
- Black responds by placing any piece (except Queen Bee) adjacent to White’s piece.  
- Players alternate turns thereafter.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
On each turn, a player must take **one** of the following actions:  
- **Place** a new piece from their reserve into the hive.  
- **Move** a piece already in play.  
- **Pass**, but only if they cannot legally place or move any piece.  

A player may not move any of their pieces until their **Queen Bee has been placed**. The Queen Bee must be placed **on or before the player’s fourth turn**.

5. **Core Mechanics**  

**One Hive Rule**  
At all times, all pieces in play must be connected edge-to-edge in a single group. No piece may be placed or moved such that it separates the hive or leaves a piece isolated.

**Freedom to Move**  
Except for the Grasshopper and Beetle, all pieces must **slide** into position. A piece cannot move into or out of a space if the path is physically blocked by adjacent stacked or surrounding pieces.  
- The **Grasshopper** may jump directly over pieces.  
- The **Beetle** may climb over and onto other pieces.

**Movement Abilities**  
Each insect has a unique movement ability:  

- **Queen Bee**: Moves exactly **1 space** (a crawl). Must be placed by turn 4.  
- **Ant**: Moves **any number of spaces** around the hive via connected empty spaces.  
- **Beetle**: Moves **1 space** in any direction — horizontally, or by **climbing** onto or **falling** off a stack. Can occupy upper levels.  
- **Grasshopper**: Jumps in a straight line over **one or more** adjacent pieces into the **first empty space** beyond. Must jump; cannot crawl.  
- **Spider**: Moves exactly **3 spaces** per turn, each a single crawl. Path must be continuous and cannot backtrack (cannot revisit any space, including the starting space).  
- **Ladybug**: Moves **3 spaces**:  
  1. One **climb** onto a stack.  
  2. One **crawl or climb** on top of the hive.  
  3. One **fall** down to ground level.  
  Must end on the ground. Cannot move around the perimeter.  
- **Mosquito**: Copies the movement ability of **any adjacent piece** (including opponent’s).  
  - If on the ground and adjacent only to another Mosquito, it **cannot move**.  
  - If on top of the hive, moves as a **Beetle** until it climbs down.  
  - Can copy special abilities (e.g., Pillbug’s power) if adjacent.  
- **Pillbug**:  
  - May move itself **1 space**, or  
  - Use its special ability: **move an adjacent ground-level piece** (any color) by:  
    1. Climbing onto the Pillbug.  
    2. Falling into an empty adjacent space.  
  - Restrictions:  
    - Cannot move a piece that is stacked.  
    - Cannot move the opponent’s **most recently moved** piece.  
    - Any piece moved (by any means) is **immobile on the next turn** (cannot move or be moved, and cannot use abilities).

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- The game ends **immediately** when **one Queen Bee is completely surrounded** by six adjacent pieces (any color).  
- The player whose Queen Bee is surrounded **loses**.  
- If the **final move** surrounds **both** Queen Bees, the game is a **draw**.  
- A draw may also occur if:  
  - Players repeat the same position **three times** (stalemate).  
  - Players mutually agree to a draw due to an unresolvable loop.  
- No points are scored; the game is win/loss/draw.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can I move a piece that just moved?**  
  No. Any piece that moved (including via Pillbug) is **resting** and cannot move or be moved on the **next full turn**.  
- **Can a Mosquito mimic a Pillbug’s ability?**  
  Yes, if adjacent to a Pillbug, the Mosquito may use its power to move another piece.  
- **Can I place a piece into a fully enclosed space?**  
  Yes, as long as it is adjacent only to your own pieces and does not violate placement rules.  
- **Can a piece be moved if it breaks the hive during movement?**  
  No. The hive must remain connected **at all times**, even during movement.  
- **Can a Beetle move off a stack?**  
  Yes, via a **fall** — it crawls horizontally to an adjacent space and then drops down to ground level if possible.  
- **Can the Pillbug move itself after using its power?**  
  No — using its power counts as its action for the turn.
