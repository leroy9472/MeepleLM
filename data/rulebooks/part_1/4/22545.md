1. Lore & Objective  
In the late 15th century, European powers race to explore, colonize, and exploit the New World. As a leader of a colonial power (England, France, Spain, Portugal, or Holland), you aim to amass the most victory points (VPs) through discovery, colonization, trade, and capital development. Victory is determined by a combination of territorial control, economic strength, exploration, and strategic building ownership.

2. Components  
- Gameboard: Depicts 9 regions of North and South America, each associated with a trade good; right side features event boxes.  
- Colonists: 30 per player color (red, yellow, green, blue, orange).  
- Specialists: Per color: 5 Captains, 5 Merchants, 10 Missionaries, 10 Soldiers.  
- Capital Building Tiles: 34 total (11 Age I, 13 Age II, 10 Age III).  
- Trade Goods: 44 counters (gold x5, silver x6, cattle x3, cocoa x3, fish x3, sugar x6, fur x4, coffee x4, tobacco x5, rice x3, indigo x4).  
- Merchant Ships: 10 caravels (1 Turn Marker, 1 blocks unused Colonist Dock spaces, 8 for trade).  
- Money: 50 silver coins (1 Spanish Dollar each), 40 gold coins (10 Spanish Dollars each).  
- Discovery Counters: 16 cardboard tiles (used face down initially).  
- Discovery Deck: 16 cards (used after all regions are discovered).  
- Turn Marker: One merchant ship used to track game turns.

3. Setup  
- Each player chooses a color and takes corresponding colonists and specialists.  
- Each player starts with 10 Spanish Dollars and 5 colonists.  
- One colonist per player is randomly placed in the Turn Order box to determine initial turn order. The 2nd player receives $1, 3rd gets $2, etc.  
- Place one trade good face up in each region (as labeled on the board).  
- Place one random Discovery Counter face down in each region except the Caribbean (which is open from the start).  
- Shuffle Capital Buildings by age (I, II, III) and place 5 random Age I buildings face up at the top of the board.  
- Place 4 random Trade Goods face up beside the Trade Goods box.  
- Place a Merchant Ship in the Merchant Shipping box.  
- Block unused Colonist Dock spaces: available spaces = (2 × number of players) – 1; use a ship to mark blocked spaces.  
- X and Y spaces on Colonist Dock are only accessible via specific Capital Buildings.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 8 turns, divided into 3 Ages:  
- Age I: Turns 1–3  
- Age II: Turns 4–6  
- Age III: Turns 7–8  

Each turn proceeds in phases:  
A. Colonist/Specialist Placement: Players place one colonist or specialist at a time in turn order into event boxes.  
B. Resolution: Event boxes are resolved top to bottom.  
C. Income: Players collect income from trade goods and merchant ships.  
D. Capital Building Benefits: Recurring benefits are applied.  
E. Refresh Capital Buildings: Replace face-up buildings to maintain 5 available (advance to next Age after Turns 3 and 6).  
F. Refresh Trade Goods: Replace 4 face-up trade goods.  
G. Refresh Merchant Ship: Place a new ship in the Merchant Shipping box if empty.  
H. Receive New Colonists: Each player gets 5 new colonists.  
I. New Turn Order: Colonists from Initiative box move to Turn Order; non-participants go behind in previous order.  
J. Advance Turn Marker: Move to next turn.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Worker Placement: Players place colonists/specialists in event boxes to claim actions.  
- Specialists:  
  - Captain: Counts as 2 colonists in Discovery or Merchant Shipping.  
  - Merchant: Counts as 2 in Merchant Shipping; earns $5 when arriving via Colonist Dock.  
  - Missionary: Adds 1 free colonist upon arrival via Colonist Dock.  
  - Soldier: Earns plunder money per soldier on successful Discovery; used in Warfare to eliminate enemy units.  
- Colonist Dock: Colonists move to discovered regions in placement order. First to 3 colonists/specialists in a region gains its trade good.  
- Trade Goods: Players acquire goods from regions or Trade Goods box. Income is generated by forming sets:  
  - Any 3 different = $1  
  - 3 of same kind = $3  
  - 4 of same kind = $6  
  - Merchant Ships act as wild cards (1 per set).  
- Discovery: Players send colonists/specialists from Discovery box to attempt region discovery. Expedition strength must meet or exceed Native American icons on counter. Success grants money, a free colonist in the region, and the Discovery Counter (for VP at game end). Failed attempts return colonists; counters remain face down.  
- Discovery Deck: Used after all 9 regions are discovered. Works like counters but grants no colonist placement.  
- Capital Buildings: Purchased during Capital Building phase. Cost: $10 (Age I), $14 (Age II), $20 (Age III). Benefits vary (e.g., recurring colonists, one-time bonuses, VPs).  
- Warfare:  
  - Battle: $0 cost. Declare against one opponent in one region. Each soldier eliminates one enemy unit.  
  - War: $10 cost. Fights occur in all regions where both players have soldiers.  
  - Casualties are simultaneous; attacker chooses elimination order.  
- Specialist Acquisition: Players place in Specialist box to gain a specific specialist next turn. Pay $5 to train any specialist. Only one per box per turn.  
- National Advantages (chosen at start):  
  - England: Take $1 from each player per turn (during Capital Building Benefits).  
  - France: +1 colonist in each newly discovered colony.  
  - Spain: +$5 per successful Discovery.  
  - Portugal: One free Discovery at game start (immediate use).  
  - Holland: +$1 for every 2 Trade Goods owned per turn.  
- Builder Rule (from addendum): A Builder (from Specialist box) can be taken for free from the $5 training slot. Builders increase VP value in colonies: +4 VP for 1st place, +2 VP for 2nd place per Builder (only in scored regions).  
- Specialist Swapping: Specialists without New World function (Captains, Merchants, Missionaries if Reformation not owned) can be swapped for colonists at any time. Functional specialists (Soldiers, Builders, Missionaries if Reformation owned) can only be swapped when out of supply and entitled to a new one.

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after Turn 8. Final scoring:  
- Colonies: Scored at end of Ages I (Turn 3), II (Turn 6), and III (Turn 8).  
  - Only colonies with ≥3 colonists/specialists from one player are scored.  
  - 1st place: 6 VPs; 2nd place: 2 VPs.  
  - 2-way tie for 1st: Each gets 2 VPs; 2nd place not awarded.  
  - 3-way or more tie for 1st: All get 0 VPs.  
  - Tie for 2nd: 0 VPs.  
- Discoveries: Red number on Discovery Counters and Cards.  
- Capital Buildings: VPs as indicated (e.g., Navy: 4 VP per Merchant Ship; Wealth: 1 VP per $5 owned).  
- Economy: VPs equal to income generated from trade goods and merchant ships on Turn 8.  
- Buying VPs: After scoring Economy, players may spend money to buy VPs in turn order: $1 = 1 VP in Age I, $3 = 1 VP in Age II, $10 = 1 VP in Age III. Wealth building VP is scored before buying.  

Tiebreakers:  
1. Most VPs from colonies in Age III (Turn 8).  
2. Most gold.  
3. Most trade goods.
