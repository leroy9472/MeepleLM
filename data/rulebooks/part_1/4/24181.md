## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players represent international financiers investing in six pre-World War I European powers: Austria-Hungary, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia. The goal is to amass the most Victory Points (VPs) by accumulating wealth through bond investments and cash on hand. A nation's success increases the value of its bonds, and players earn VPs based on their bond holdings and remaining cash when the game ends.

### 2. Components  
- Game board showing Europe with provinces, sea regions, and a rondel (action wheel)  
- 6 sets of nation markers (octagons): 1 per nation for rondel, tax chart, and scoring track  
- 30 factories: 18 brown (armaments), 12 light blue (shipyards)  
- 48 bonds: 8 per nation in denominations from 1m to 8m  
- Wooden army and fleet units (limited supply)  
- Flag/tax disks (limited: 10 per nation)  
- Investor card  
- Bank supply of money (unlimited)  
- Power point track (0–25)  
- Tax chart (0–20m revenue, with power point increments)

### 3. Setup  
**Board Setup:**  
- Place one nation marker:  
  - In the center of the rondel  
  - On space 0 of the power scoring track  
  - On the lowest (0) space of the tax chart  
- Place 2 factories per nation:  
  - Brown armament factory on each nation’s brown city  
  - Light blue shipyard on each nation’s light blue city  
- Sort bonds by nation, low to high (1m to 8m), and place beside each nation’s treasury.

**Player Setup (by player count):**  
- **2 players:** 35m each, one trio of flags:  
  - Player 1: Austria, France, Germany  
  - Player 2: Italy, Russia, Britain  
- **3 players:** 24m each, one pair of flags:  
  - Austria/Britain, Italy/Russia, France/Germany  
- **4–6 players:** 13m each, one random flag each  

Remaining flags (in 4–5 player games) go to the player holding the 4m bond of that nation. If no such bond exists, the nation remains uncontrolled.

**Bond Acquisition:**  
Each player takes all bonds listed on their assigned flags and pays the corresponding amount to the nation’s treasury.

**Investor Card:**  
Given to the player immediately to the left of the player who controls Austria-Hungary. If Austria is uncontrolled, give it to the player left of Russia’s controller.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Nations take turns in fixed order, not players:  
1. Austria  
2. Italy  
3. France  
4. Britain  
5. Germany  
6. Russia  

Each nation’s turn is controlled by the player holding the most total bond debt in that nation (the "governing player"). On a nation’s turn:  
1. The governing player selects a rondel action space.  
2. Moves the nation’s marker 1–6 spaces clockwise around the rondel:  
   - First 3 spaces: free  
   - Each additional space: costs 2m of *player’s* personal cash (max 6m for 3 extra spaces)  
3. Executes the action at the landed space.  
4. If the Investor space is passed (but not landed on), steps 2–5 of the Investor action are triggered after the chosen action.  
5. Turn proceeds to the next nation in order. Skip nations with no controller.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Rondel Actions (in clockwise order):  

**Factory (5m cost from treasury)**  
- Build one factory in any home province city with no hostile armies.  
- Brown city → brown armament factory (produces armies)  
- Blue city → light blue shipyard (produces fleets)  
- Max one factory per city.  

**Production (Free)**  
- Each factory produces:  
  - Armament → 1 army  
  - Shipyard → 1 fleet  
- Only if no hostile armies are present in the province.  

**Import (1m per unit)**  
- Buy 1–3 military units (army or fleet) for 1m each.  
- Armies: placed in any home province with no hostiles.  
- Fleets: placed at blue seaports in home provinces.  

**Maneuver (Free, 3 steps in order):**  
1. **Fleet Movement:**  
   - Fleets move to adjacent sea region.  
   - Fleets start "at anchor" (on land); first move must be to adjacent sea.  
   - Fleets cannot return to land.  
   - Sea Battle: if fleets of different nations occupy same region, battle occurs if either side wishes. Fleets matched 1:1 and removed.  
2. **Army Movement:**  
   - Armies move to adjacent land region.  
   - Convoy: army adjacent to sea may cross multiple sea regions *if* its nation’s fleets occupy all crossed sea regions. Each fleet transports 1 army.  
   - Railroad: armies may move freely within home provinces (no hostiles) before/after regular move.  
   - Land Battle: armies in same region may battle if one side wishes. Matched 1:1 and removed.  
3. **Factory Destruction & Occupation:**  
   - 3 armies may destroy a foreign factory if no defending units present.  
   - Exception: A nation’s *last* factory cannot be destroyed.  
   - Place a tax/flag disk in any newly occupied land or sea region (no foreign units).  
   - Cannot place in home regions.  
   - Max 10 tax disks per nation.  

**Investor (Landed on – 5 steps in order):**  
1. **Pay Interest:**  
   - Each bondholder receives interest equal to bond value (e.g., 4m bond → 4m interest).  
   - Paid first from nation’s treasury.  
   - If insufficient, governing player covers shortfall from personal cash.  
   - Cannot choose this action if treasury + player cash cannot cover non-governing players’ interest.  
2. **Activate Investor:**  
   - Investor card holder gains 2m from bank.  
   - May buy one new bond or upgrade one existing bond (return one, take next higher, pay difference to treasury).  
3. **Invest with No Flag:**  
   - Players with no flag (and not holding Investor card) may invest once (same rules as above).  
   - Order: clockwise from Investor card holder.  
4. **Check Government Control:**  
   - Nation control shifts to player with highest total bond debt.  
   - Tie: player who acquired bonds first wins.  
   - If player loses last flag and nation has 0 power, new controller pays them 1m (optional rule).  
5. **Pass Investor Card:**  
   - Move card clockwise to next player.  

*If Investor space is passed (not landed on):*  
- Only steps 2–5 above occur, after the chosen action.

**Taxation (3 steps in order):**  
1. **Calculate Revenue:**  
   - 2m per factory with no hostiles  
   - 1m per tax/flag disk  
   - Total determines position on tax chart (2–20m)  
   - Success Bonus: +1m per level increase on tax chart (paid to governing player)  
2. **Pay Soldiers, Collect Money:**  
   - Deduct 1m per army/fleet from revenue  
   - Remaining amount goes to nation’s treasury (can be negative; no penalty)  
3. **Add Power Points:**  
   - Add power points as shown on right side of tax chart (e.g., 6m revenue → +2 power points)  
   - Track accumulates; nation with 25 power points ends the game.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Condition:**  
- Game ends immediately when any nation reaches **25 power points**.  
- If the Investor space is passed on the final turn, ignore it.

**Scoring:**  
Each player scores:  
- **Bond Value:** For each bond held, (bond interest × nation’s credit multiplier)  
  - Credit multiplier = nation’s power points ÷ 5 (rounded down, max 5)  
  - E.g., 4m bond in nation with 18 power → 4 × 3 = 12 VPs  
- **Cash:** 1m = 1 VP  

**Total VPs = Σ(bond interest × credit multiplier) + cash**

**Tiebreaker:**  
1. Compare highest credit (total bond value) in the nation with highest power.  
2. If still tied, compare next highest power nation, etc.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you sell bonds?** No.  
- **Can players lend money or trade bonds?** No.  
- **Can fleets move and convoy in same turn?** Yes.  
- **Can you convoy without moving armies by rail first?** Yes, as long as army is adjacent to sea.  
- **Hostile vs Friendly Armies:**  
  - Hostile: upright; blocks Production, Import, Taxation, Factory, Railroad in that province  
  - Friendly: sideways; no restrictions  
  - Can change status during Maneuver phase even if not moving  
- **Map Notes:**  
  - Armies can cross Bulgaria–Turkey  
  - Convoy required: Dublin–Edinburgh, Spain–Morocco, Sweden–Denmark  
  - Not adjacent: Morocco–Western Med, Algeria–Bay of Biscay  
  - Dublin not connected by rail to rest of Britain  
- **Uncontrolled Nations:** Skip their turn.  
- **National Treasuries:** Public. Personal cash: may be hidden.  
- **Factory Destruction:** Requires 3 armies. Last factory of a nation cannot be destroyed.  
- **Tax Disks:** Finite (10 per nation). Cannot be placed in home regions.
