# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Space Alert is a real-time cooperative game where players take on the roles of a spaceship crew defending their vessel from internal and external threats over a short, intense mission. The objective is to survive the mission by neutralizing threats before they destroy the ship. Success is measured by a final score based on threats defeated, damage sustained, and crew survival.

## 2. Components
- Game board (spaceship with zones and stations)
- Action boards (1–7 or 8–12 spaces depending on scenario)
- Mission Steps Board (with turn tracking and computer maintenance steps)
- Threat Trajectory Boards (Red, White, Blue, and Internal)
- Player pieces and colored figures
- Green cubes (energy), Yellow cubes (weapon power), Blue cylinder (fuel)
- Yellow tokens (track threat timing)
- Threat cards (Purple for external, Green for internal)
- Grey-backed Action Cards (standard actions)
- Gold Heroic Action Cards
- Battlebot figures
- Rockets
- Damage tiles (by zone and system)
- Grey maintenance markers
- Oval tokens (for internal threats)

## 3. Setup
### General Setup
- Choose roles: Captain (final decisions), Communications Officer (tracks threats), Security Officer (handles internal threats).
- Each player takes a figure and action board.
- Set up ship board: Stations in Red, White, Blue zones (Upper and Lower Decks), each with Systems A (Weapons), B (Energy), C (Special).
- Initial energy: 1 green cube on each shield, 2 on lateral reactors, 3 green cubes and 3 cylinders on central reactor. 1 yellow cube on each Laser Cannon.
- Place 3 Threat Trajectory Boards (randomly assigned to Red, White, Blue).
- Place Threat Cards: Purple for external (Common, Serious), Green for internal, separated into decks.
- Place yellow tokens (1–4) by trajectories.
- Deal action cards: 5 face-down to 1–3, 5 face-down to 4–7 of each player's board (6 per phase in 3-player; 7+6 in 2-player; 7+7 in solo).
- Include 1 Heroic Action Card per player in Phase 1 (gold card).
- Place Battlebots in Upper Blue and Lower Red (if applicable).
- Place rockets in Lower Blue (2 in base, 3 in advanced).
- Place 2 grey maintenance markers on computer.

### Little Duckling Variant Setup
- Only 2 zones: Red and Blue.
- 4 stations: Upper Red, Upper Blue, Lower Red, Lower Blue.
- Initial state: 1 energy on each shield, 2 on each reactor, 1 fuel capsule per reactor, 1 yellow block per light laser, 2 rockets in Lower Blue.
- Battlebots start in Upper Blue.
- Use only 1–7 action board and 2-line Mission Steps Board.
- 2 external threat trajectories (Red, Blue), 1 internal.
- Only 5 damage tiles per color (ship destroyed after 6 hits).

## 4. Gameplay Flow
### Action Round (Real-Time, 5–10 minutes)
- Play audio track (7 min base, 10 min advanced).
- Computer issues announcements:
  - "Time T+x: [Serious] Threat. Zone Y" → Comms draws threat card, places on matching trajectory with yellow token.
  - "Incoming Data" → Each player draws 1 card.
  - "Data Transfer" → Each player may pass 1 card (not Heroic) to another.
  - "Communication System Down" → No talking until "Restored".
  - "First/Second Phase Ends" → Lock in actions for current phase.
- Players plan actions face-down on their boards:
  - Use cards with movement (Left, Right, Lift) or action (A, B, C, Battlebot).
  - May rearrange freely until phase ends.
  - Heroic Actions: Special boosts (e.g., +1 cannon damage, extra energy transfer).

### Resolution Round (Turn-by-Turn)
1. Reset ship to initial state.
2. Place Mission Steps Board (1–7 turns).
3. Blue marker starts at "Exit Hyperspace".
4. For each turn:
   - **Threat Appears**: If a threat has a T+x token matching current turn, place it on trajectory.
   - **Player Actions**: Reveal cards clockwise from Captain.
     - Move: Left/Right through doors, Lift between decks (1 per turn; excess cause delay).
     - Activate Systems:
       - A: Fire weapons (move green/yellow cubes).
       - B: Transfer energy or refuel reactors.
       - C: Special actions (Pulse Cannon, Rockets, Battlebots, Computer Maintenance).
   - **Compute Damage**:
     - Weapons fire: Sum strength vs. threat shields. Damage = (sum - shields). Remove red cubes if HP ≤ 0.
     - Return used cubes to supply.
   - **Threat Movement & Actions**:
     - Move threats by speed. Perform X, Y, Z actions in order.
     - Damage = (attack strength) - (shield cubes). Remove cubes; apply damage tiles.
     - If a zone accumulates 7 damage tiles, ship is destroyed.
   - **Rocket Movement**: Move rocket from first to second space; fires next turn.
   - **Computer Maintenance Check**: If no grey cube on step, all players delayed.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Movement
- Arrows: Move one zone left/right.
- Lift: Move between decks. Only one player per turn; others delayed.
- Gravolift Damage: All up/down movement causes delay.

### Actions
- **A (Weapons)**:
  - Heavy Cannon: 4 damage, range 3, uses 1 green from same zone.
  - Light Cannon: 2 damage, range 3, uses yellow block.
  - Pulse Cannon: 1 damage, range 2, targets all threats in range.
- **B (Energy)**:
  - Shields: Transfer green cubes from reactor to shield (max 2).
  - Reactors: Refuel (return cylinder, fill to 4) or transfer 2 energy from other reactor.
- **C (Special)**:
  - Pulse Cannon: Activate via C in Lower Red.
  - Rockets: Launch (place on track); fires next turn at nearest threat (3 damage, range 2).
  - Computer Maintenance: Move grey cube to check step (Phase 1 and 2 required).
  - Battlebots: Activate squad; attack intruders or pilot interceptors (not in Little Duckling).
- **Delays**:
  - Caused by gravolift conflict, computer failure, or tripping.
  - Move current action to next turn; bump last action off.

### Threats
- **External**: Move down trajectory, attack at X/Y/Z.
- **Internal**:
  - Malfunctions: Disable system; repair by activating system.
  - Intruders: Attack in station; defeat with Battlebots.
- **Handicaps (Little Duckling)**:
  - HP: 1 damage block per 3 HP (rounded down).
  - Speed: -1 if speed ≥ 3 (except T+4 threats).
  - Shields: Max 3 (2 in 1–2 player).

### Heroic Actions
- Movement: Instant move to station.
- A: +1 weapon damage.
- B: Add 1 extra cube from supply when transferring; counts as two repairs if fixing malfunction.
- C: Visual confirmation — move cube on phase track; enables scoring bonus.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### Victory Conditions
- Ship survives all turns.
- All players not knocked out.
- Computer maintained in both phases.

### Scoring
- + Higher points for defeated threats (from Captain).
- + Lower points for survived threats (from Comms).
- – Total damage tiles on ship.
- – Damage of most damaged zone.
- – 2 points per knocked-out player.
- – 1 point per disabled Battlebot.
- + 1 point per visual confirmation (C actions in same turn).
- **Little Duckling Additional Penalties**:
  - –1 if two players end in same room.
  - –3 if all three end in same room.

### Campaign Rules
- Up to 3 consecutive missions.
- Lose campaign if any mission fails.
- Between missions:
  - Repair: Each surviving player repairs 1 damage or disabled Battlebot.
  - Unrepaired systems: reduced capacity.
  - Disabled Battlebots not reactivated.
- Bonus: +5 for two consecutive missions >5 pts; +10 for three >10 pts.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Tripping**: If you misplace a card, say “Oops! I tripped” and correct it. Causes a delay.
- **Data Transfer**: Can only pass non-Heroic cards. Must complete before beep.
- **Simultaneous Repairs**: Multiple players can repair same malfunction in one turn.
- **Rocket Firing**: Fires during Compute Damage step after being moved to second space.
- **Interceptor Use**: Battlebots pilot Interceptors; attack all external threats in range 1 (3 damage if one target, 1 each if multiple).
- **Internal Threats**: Not reduced by shields; can knock out players.
- **Computer Failure**: If not maintained in Phase 1 → delay all Action 4. If not in Phase 2 → mission lost.
- **Solo Play**: May perform one "double action" per phase (two cards in one turn, top resolved first).
