## SUMMONER WARS 2ND EDITION — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
**Lore**:  
In the world of Itharia, Ret-Talus, the lord of the Fallen Kingdom, discovered the first Summoning Stone and became the first Summoner. For a thousand years, he ruled unchallenged until Dane Lightbringer found a second stone, sparking hope and a race among factions to claim their own Summoning Stones. As more Summoners emerged, they turned on each other instead of uniting against Ret-Talus, igniting the Summoner Wars.

**Objective**:  
Destroy your opponent’s summoner to win the game.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Phase 1: Summon  
- Summon **any number** of units from hand.  
- Pay cost in **magic** (move token down magic track).  
- Place unit on **empty space adjacent to a gate you control**.  
- Cannot summon if no valid space exists.  

#### Phase 2: Move  
- Move **up to 3 different units** you control.  
- Each can move **1 or 2 spaces**.  
- Movement rules:  
  - Move into or through **empty adjacent spaces** (sharing an edge).  
  - **No diagonal movement**.  
  - Cannot move through other cards.  
  - Units that are also **structures** cannot move unless an effect allows it.  
- A unit may move 1 space and return to original space (e.g., to trigger "after moving" abilities).  

#### Phase 3: Build  
- Build **any number** of structures (gates, walls, etc.) from hand.  
- Pay cost in magic.  
- Place on:  
  - Empty space **adjacent to your summoner**, OR  
  - Empty space in your **back 3 rows** (closest to you).  

#### Phase 4: Attack  
- Attack with **up to 3 different units** (not necessarily moved this turn).  
- Steps per attack:  
  1. **Declare Target**:  
     - **Melee unit** (⚔️): Target adjacent enemy.  
     - **Ranged unit** (🏹): Target up to **3 clear straight spaces** away (horizontal/vertical, no diagonals, no blocking).  
  2. **Roll Dice**: Roll number of dice equal to unit’s **strength**.  
  3. **Add Damage**: 1 damage per die showing symbol matching unit’s attack type (⚔️ or 🏹).  
- **Damaging & Destroying**:  
  - Place **damage tokens** on target.  
  - Card is **destroyed** when damage ≥ life.  
  - Discard destroyed card (and any cards under it).  
  - **Gain 1 magic** when a card you control destroys an enemy card.  
- **Cost of Inaction**:  
  - If **no attack targets enemy**, add **1 damage to your summoner** at end of Attack Phase.  

#### Phase 5: Magic  
- Discard **any number** of cards from hand.  
- Gain **1 magic per card discarded**.  

#### Phase 6: Draw  
- If hand has **fewer than 5 cards**, draw up to 5.  
- **No reshuffling**: If draw pile is empty, you cannot draw.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition**: When only one player’s **summoner** remains on the battlefield, that player wins.  
- There is **no scoring system**; victory is achieved solely by eliminating the opponent’s summoner.  
- **Losing Condition**: Your summoner is destroyed.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play an active event if I already have one with the same name?**  
  → No. You cannot have two active events with the same name in play.  

- **Can a unit attack without moving?**  
  → Yes. Attack phase is independent of movement.  

- **Can a unit attack twice?**  
  → Only if an effect grants an **extra attack**. Otherwise, each unit can attack only once per turn.  

- **What happens when a card is under another card?**  
  - It is **not on the battlefield**, but still **in play**.  
  - Cannot be targeted unless specified.  
  - Discarded when the top card is destroyed, discarded, or returned.  

- **What happens if my draw pile is empty?**  
  → You do **not** reshuffle discard pile. You cannot draw cards.  

- **Can I build a structure anywhere?**  
  → Only **adjacent to your summoner** or in your **back 3 rows**.  

- **Can I summon a unit if I have no gates?**  
  → No. You must control at least one gate with an adjacent empty space.  

- **Do I gain magic if my effect destroys my own unit?**  
  → No. Magic is only gained when **enemy** cards are destroyed by your units, events, or abilities.  

- **Timing Conflicts**:  
  → If multiple effects trigger simultaneously, **current player** chooses resolution order.  

- **Triggered Abilities (e.g., "After this unit moves")**:  
  → Resolved **immediately after** the triggering event, before any other effects (except other "after" effects).  

- **"Instead of" Effects**:  
  → Replace the normal action (e.g., "instead of moving" means no movement occurs, so "after moving" does not trigger).  
  → Still counts toward phase limits (e.g., using "instead of moving" counts as using that unit’s move).  

- **Card Control**:  
  → If you take control of a card, **rotate it 180°** so it faces you.  
  → You also gain control of any cards **under** it.
