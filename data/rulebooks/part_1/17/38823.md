# Conflict of Heroes: Storms of Steel – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Conflict of Heroes: Storms of Steel is a tactical World War II wargame set during the Battle of Kursk in 1943. Players command German or Soviet forces in historically inspired engagements. The objective is to earn more Victory Points (VPs) than the opponent by the end of the mission through controlling objectives, destroying enemy units, or achieving mission-specific conditions.

Victory is determined by which side holds the Victory Advantage on the VP Track when the mission ends. One side always has the advantage—there are no ties.

2. **Place Map**: As specified by the mission (e.g., Map 7 for Mission 1).
3. **Set Up Units**: Place units according to the Mission Book setup diagrams. Units must be placed with red bar face-down; green bar indicates front.
4. **Place CAP Markers**: Set CAPs Track Marker to the starting CAP value listed in the Mission Book (e.g., 5 for Germans, 6 for Soviets in Mission 1).
5. **Prepare Battle Draw Deck**: Shuffle Battle Cards #02–#11 (or as specified). Each player draws 2 cards. Each starts with Card #01: Adrenaline in hand.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
A mission consists of multiple rounds. Each round proceeds as follows:

#### Round Sequence:
1. **Players Alternate Turns**
   - The player with Initiative takes the first turn.
   - On your turn, you must:
     - Take one Action with a unit, or
     - Pass
2. **Actions Include**:
   - Move (including pivot)
   - Attack
   - Rally a hit unit
   - Play a Battle Card
   - Stall (1AP action that does nothing)
3. **After Action**:
   - Determine Action Cost (base cost + modifiers like Fatigue, terrain, hit markers).
   - Make a Spent Check using the d10:
     - Roll > Action Cost → Unit remains Fresh
     - Roll ≤ Action Cost → Unit becomes Spent (flip to red side)
4. **Fatigue Rule**:
   - If a unit acted on your previous turn, its next action has +1AP Fatigue penalty (non-cumulative).
5. **End of Round**:
   - When both players Pass consecutively, the round ends.
6. **Pre-Round Sequence**:
   - Advance Round Marker
   - Flip all Spent Units to Fresh
   - Reset CAPs (original value minus 1 per destroyed unit)
   - Draw Battle Cards
   - Prepare Reinforcements
   - Plan/resolve Off-Board Artillery
   - Roll for Initiative (side without VP Advantage rolls 2d6 ≥8, may spend CAPs to modify)

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Command Action Points (CAPs)
- Represent command and logistics support.
- Spent before actions to modify outcomes.

**Uses of CAPs**:
- **Reduce Action Cost**: Spend any number of CAPs to reduce Action Cost by 1 per CAP. If cost reaches 0AP:
  - No Spent Check is made.
  - Spent units may take the action.
- **Modify d6 Die Rolls**: Spend up to 2 CAPs to adjust success number by ±1 per CAP on:
  - Attack rolls
  - Rally checks
  - Initiative checks
  - Drift checks (artillery)
- **Command Actions**: Pay full cost in CAPs to perform an action with any unit (Fresh or Spent), no Spent Check.

#### Spent Check
- Roll d10 after action.
- Success if roll > Action Cost.
- Failure flips unit to Spent side.
- Spent units can only take 0AP actions (via CAPs) or card actions.

#### Movement
- **Foot Units**:
  - Move to adjacent hex (1AP base).
  - May pivot after moving.
  - Pivoting in place: 1AP.
  - Penalties:
    - Difficult Terrain: +1AP (Woods, Buildings)
    - Backwards Move: +1AP (into flank hex)
    - Uphill: +1AP (L0→L1), +2AP (L0→L2)
- **Vehicles**:
  - Tracked (blue move cost): May bonus move on Roads, Open, Corn, Wheat.
  - Wheeled (green move cost): Bonus move only on Roads.
  - Each bonus move symbol (● or ⊙) allows +1 hex movement.
  - Impassable: Steep terrain, anti-tank ditches, small balkas.
  - Cannot attack down steep terrain.

#### Combat
- **Fire Zone Requirements**:
  - Within Arc of Fire (front three hexes)
  - Line of Sight (LOS) unblocked
  - Within 2× unit’s Range
- **Attack Steps**:
  1. Determine Target’s Defense Rating (DR):
     - DR = Defense + Terrain (+2 Woods, +2 Stone Bldg, +1 Wood Bldg)
     - Use Front Defense if in arc, Flank Defense otherwise
  2. Determine Attacker’s Attack Rating (AR):
     - AR = Firepower (FP) + modifiers
     - Red FP vs red (soft) targets; Blue FP vs blue (armored)
     - Short Range (+3AR if adjacent), Long Range (−2AR if beyond range)
     - Close Combat: +4AR (except support weapons: −2AR)
  3. Hit Number = DR − AR
  4. Roll 2d6 ≥ Hit Number = Hit
- **Critical Hit**: Roll exceeds Hit Number by 4+ → target destroyed immediately.
- **Hit Markers**:
  - Draw random face-down marker of correct type (soft/armored).
  - Effects apply immediately but remain secret until revealed (e.g., when modifying cost or hit number).

#### Rallying
- A hit unit may attempt to Rally (5AP + modifiers).
- Rally Check: 2d6 ≥ Rally Number on marker.
- Modifiers:
  - −1 if in Woods, Buildings, Corn/Wheat (Aug/Sep)
  - −1 per friendly un-hit unit stacked
  - May spend up to 2 CAPs to reduce Rally Number
- Rally Action requires Spent Check (Action Cost = 5AP + modifiers).
- Rally fails if:
  - In hex with enemy
  - Marker says “No Rally”

#### Group Actions
- Multiple units act together as a group.
- Only one Spent Check for entire group.
- All units must be Fresh unless action cost reduced to 0AP with CAPs.
- **Group Move**: Cost = highest individual move cost.
- **Group Attack**: One leader attacks; adjacent supporting units in fire zone and range grant +1AR each.
- **Group Rally**: Rally multiple adjacent units; each makes individual check.

#### Hidden Units
- Units may be set up as Hidden (per mission).
- Mark location secretly.
- Revealed when:
  - Takes non-stall/rally/hidden move action
  - Shares hex with non-hidden unit
  - In open terrain within 2 hexes and LOS of enemy
  - Attacked and hit
- **Hidden Move**: 5AP action; ignore terrain move penalties, but subject to fatigue.
- May attack hidden hexes; opponent secretly calculates hit.

#### Vehicles
- **Transport**: Vehicles may carry one foot unit or tow gun/immobilized vehicle.
  - Load/Unload requires group action.
  - Transported unit cannot attack.
- **Vehicle Hits**:
  - Gun Damaged: Cannot use one FP color
  - Immobilized: Cannot move
  - Suppressed: −3 red FP, −5 blue FP, +1AP to fire
  - Panicked: Cannot fire, −4 Front DR, Rally 9
  - Destroyed: Remove immediately
- **Combat**:
  - HE attacks (mortars/artillery) target Flank Defense.
  - Flamethrowers ignore terrain DR, target Flank Defense.
  - Open-topped vehicles use red DR vs HE/artillery/CC.

#### Fortifications & Obstacles
- **Trenches**: +2DR, all foot units except guns
- **Gun Pits**: +3DR front only, for guns
- **Bunkers**: +5DR front, +3DR flank, all foot except mortars
- **Hasty Defenses**: Built with 5AP action, +1DR
- **Barbed Wire**: Foot units roll 1d6 added to move cost
- **Land Mines**: Reveal when unit enters; automatic 8 Hit Number attack (may modify with CAPs)

#### Off-Board Artillery (OBA)
- Use Artillery Weapon Cards.
- Plan in Pre-Round Sequence; resolve next round.
- Drift Check: Germans succeed on 3+, Soviets on 4+.
  - Failure: Artillery Marker drifts (1–2 hexes German, 1–3 Soviet).
- Attacks all units in target and surrounding hexes.
- High Explosive: targets Flank Defense; ignores Woods DR bonus (Air Burst rule).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Points (VPs)** awarded for:
  - Destroying enemy units (as specified in mission)
  - Controlling objective hexes (via Control Markers) at end of round
  - Scoring rounds or Event Cards
- **VP Track**:
  - Marker shows which side has Victory Advantage.
  - Side with advantage: VP gain moves marker forward.
  - Side without advantage: VP gain moves marker backward.
  - If marker drops below 1, flip to other side (no zero).
- **Mission Ends** when:
  - Final round completed, or
  - Victory Conditions met (e.g., control certain hexes, destroy units)
- **Winner**: Side with Victory Advantage when mission ends.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a spent unit take any action?**  
  Only 0AP actions (via CAPs) or card actions.

- **Can you attack out of smoke?**  
  Yes, but −2AR when attacking from Heavy Smoke, −1AR from Light Smoke.

- **Do hit markers stack?**  
  No. Second hit destroys the unit.

- **Can you use CAPs after rolling?**  
  No. CAPs to modify die rolls must be spent before rolling.

- **Can a unit move and then group attack?**  
  No. Group Attack requires all units to be adjacent at start of turn.

- **What happens if a unit is transported and hit?**  
  Resolve attack against transported unit first (uses Flank Defense), then vehicle.

- **Can you use Swift Action to take two card actions?**  
  Yes, as long as each is a valid Action.

- **Are Control Markers flipped during the round?**  
  No. Only checked at end of each turn.

- **Can you attack a hidden unit with artillery?**  
  Yes, but must target a hex; if unit is there, opponent calculates hit secretly.

- **Do terrain bonuses stack with fortifications?**  
  Yes. E.g., Woods in a Bunker: DR = Base +2 Woods +5 Bunker Front.
