## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

In the dystopian world of *Blade Runner*, the future is populated by bioengineered humans known as Replicants—highly intelligent and physically advanced beings with limited lifespans. The game reimagines the classic chase mechanics of *Scotland Yard* or *N.Y. Chase* into a high-stakes hunt in 2019 Los Angeles (represented by London or Manhattan maps).

- **Replicant Players (Roy, Leon, Zhora, Pris)**: Must reach three secret objective locations (marked by hidden Starting Location cards) before their Incept Terminus Time (ITT) expires. Success means survival.
- **Detective Player (Holden, Deckard, Gaff)**: Must track down and "retire" (eliminate) all Replicants before they complete their objectives.
- **Rachael (Fifth Replicant)**: A special character who enters later. Her goal is emotional connection—she wins by reaching the Detective and winning a conflict, causing them to flee together.

The game ends when either:
- All Replicants are retired → **Detective wins**.
- All Detectives are eliminated → **Replicant with most objectives wins**.
- Rachael defeats the Detective → **Rachael and Detective win together**.

### 2. Components

- Base game: *Scotland Yard* or *N.Y. Chase* board, pawns, tickets, starting cards, logbook/visor.
- **Custom Components**:
  - 8 Character Cards: 3 Detectives (Holden, Deckard, Gaff), 4 Replicants (Roy, Leon, Zhora, Pris), 1 Rachael.
  - 16 Clue Tiles (numbered 1–3), used to track suspicion.
  - 3 plastic rings or coins (to mark "Suspected Replicants").
  - 2 six-sided dice and a dice shaker (for conflict resolution).
  - Objective Tokens: 18 red (Scotland Yard) or yellow (N.Y. Chase) tokens placed over objective locations.

### 3. Setup

1. **Assign Roles**:
   - One player is the Detective.
   - Remaining players are Replicant players.
   - Rachael is not used at start.

2. **Detective Setup**:
   - Use clear "Mr. X" pawn.
   - Start with **Holden** character card.
   - Draw a random Starting Location card, place pawn there, and discard the card.
   - Take logbook, visor, and all unused tickets.
   - Receive: 2 double-move (2X/Spinner) tickets, 3 black tickets, and all remaining taxi, bus, and subway/tube tickets.

3. **Replicant Setup**:
   - Assign Replicant characters randomly:
     - 5 players: 1 Detective, 4 Replicant players (1 Replicant each).
     - 4 players: 1 Detective, 3 Replicant players (1 player gets 2 Replicants).
     - 3 players: 1 Detective, 2 Replicant players (each gets 2 Replicants).
     - 2 players: 1 Detective, 1 Replicant player (controls all 4 Replicants).
   - Each Replicant draws 4 Starting Location cards.
   - Choose one as starting location (place matching pawn, reveal and discard card).
   - The remaining 3 are **secret objectives**—keep hidden.
   - Draw tickets equal to ITT value (16–20 total, distributed as desired among taxi, bus, subway).
   - Example: Pris (ITT 16) might take 9 taxi, 4 bus, 3 subway.

4. **Other**:
   - Shuffle Clue Tiles and place face down.
   - Place Objective Tokens on corresponding map locations.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Detective moves first (in secret).
   - Then each Replicant moves (in open).

2. **Detective Movement**:
   - Moves secretly using logbook.
   - Uses tickets (taxi, bus, subway, black, or 2X).
   - Does **not** reveal location at fixed intervals (unlike standard *Scotland Yard*).
   - Only reveals location when:
     - Engaging a **Suspected Replicant** in Combat.
     - Using a Spinner (landing phase).
     - Reached by Rachael.

3. **Replicant Movement**:
   - Move openly on the board.
   - Use tickets normally; discarded tickets go to **Detective’s supply**.
   - Can **trade tickets** when on same space.
   - Can use **Multitasking**: two of one ticket type = one of another (e.g., 2 bus = 1 subway).

4. **Detective Actions**:
   - At start of turn, may perform a **Voight-Kampff Test** on any Replicant.
   - Can use **Black Ticket** as any transport or to stay in place.
   - Can use **Spinner (2X)** to move to any location over two turns.

5. **Conflict Triggers**:
   - Voight-Kampff Test (beginning of Detective’s turn).
   - Combat (when Detective lands on Suspected Replicant).

6. **Rachael Activation**:
   - When a Replicant player loses their last active Replicant, they take control of **Rachael**.
   - Place Rachael on one of the lost Replicant’s unachieved objectives.
   - She uses remaining tickets from that Replicant.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### ITT (Incept Terminus Time)
- Each Replicant has a limited number of moves (equal to ITT: 16–20).
- Represented by tickets.
- When a Replicant runs out of tickets, they **deactivate**.
- If they haven’t reached all 3 objectives by then, they are **removed**.

#### Suspected Replicant (Clue System)
- Replicants gain **Clue Tiles** when:
  - They reach an objective.
  - They fail a Voight-Kampff Test.
- Each Clue Tile has a value: 1, 2, or 3.
- Total Clue Score determines **Suspected Replicant**:
  - Highest score → Suspected.
  - Tie? All tied Replicants are Suspected.
- Mark with a ring/coin.
- **Only Suspected Replicants can be attacked** by the Detective.

#### Voight-Kampff Test
- At start of Detective’s turn.
- Detective chooses one Replicant to test.
- Use **Conflict Resolution** (see below).
- **Detective is always Attacker first**.
- **Detective wins** → Replicant draws a Clue Tile.
- **Replicant wins** → Replicant draws one ticket of choice.

#### Combat
- Triggered when Detective moves to a location with a **Suspected Replicant**.
- Detective reveals location.
- Conflict Resolution used.
- **Detective wins** → Replicant eliminated. Discard tickets and clue tiles. Next Suspected Replicant marked.
- **Replicant wins** → Current Detective is eliminated. Replace with next in line (Holden → Deckard → Gaff).

#### Conflict Resolution (Mia System)
- Uses 2d6 and a dice shaker.
- **Attacker** rolls dice secretly, then **states a number** (truth or lie).
- **Defender** chooses:
  - **DOUBT**: Reveal dice.
    - If match → Attacker wins.
    - If not → Defender wins.
  - **ACCEPT**: Defender becomes new Attacker. Must state a **higher or equal** number. Game continues.
- Re-rolls:
  - **Voight-Kampff**: Replicant may re-roll up to **Intellect** times.
  - **Combat**: Replicant may re-roll up to **Strength** times.
  - **Detective**: May re-roll up to **2 times** per round (original rules), or use **automatic win on doubles** (variant).

#### Spinner (2X Ticket)
- Allows Detective to move to **any location** in two turns.
- Log two destinations in logbook, cover with 2X ticket.
- Place pawn on adjacent "city block" to indicate approximate landing zone.
- Cannot perform Voight-Kampff Test during Spinner move.
- After two turns, lands at destination.

#### Rachael’s Special Rules
- Controlled by first Replicant player to lose all characters.
- Enters play at one of the eliminated Replicant’s **unreached objectives**.
- Objective: Reach the Detective’s location.
- When she does:
  - Detective reveals location.
  - Special conflict: Rachael is **Attacker first**.
  - Both may re-roll up to **Intellect** times.
  - **Rachael wins** → Detective falls in love; both removed. Game continues with next Detective if available.
  - **Detective wins** → Rachael draws one Clue Tile.
- If Detective reaches Rachael? Nothing unless she is Suspected.

#### Replicant Traits
Each has one special ability:

- **Aggressive**: Always Attacker first in Combat.
- **Stealthy**: Not considered Suspected if tied for highest Clue Score.
- **Lethal**: Wins Combat automatically on a roll of 7.
- **Rational**: When drawing a Clue Tile, draw 2, choose 1, discard the other.
- **Sensual**: Always Attacker first in Voight-Kampff Tests.
- **VK Master**: Wins Voight-Kampff automatically on a roll of 7.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

**Detective Wins If**:
- All Replicants are eliminated.

**Replicant Wins If**:
- Any Replicant reaches all 3 objectives.
- OR, if all Detectives are eliminated, the Replicant player with the **most objectives completed** wins.

**Rachael Wins If**:
- She defeats the Detective in conflict after reaching his location → **shared win** with Detective.

**Game End Conditions**:
- Replicants run out of moves (ITT) without completing objectives → removed.
- Detective runs out of Detectives (Holden, Deckard, Gaff all defeated) → Replicant player with most objectives wins.
- Rachael retires or wins → game continues unless no Detectives remain.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can the Detective attack a Replicant not Suspected?**  
  No. Even if on same space, no attack unless Suspected.

- **What if two Replicants tie for highest Clue Score?**  
  Both are Suspected. Detective may choose which to attack.

- **Can Replicants help each other?**  
  Yes—trade tickets when on same space. Cannot share objectives.

- **What happens when a Detective is eliminated?**  
  Replace with next Detective (Holden → Deckard → Gaff). New Detective enters on any adjacent city block (like Spinner landing), no ticket needed.

- **Can Rachael be attacked?**  
  Yes, if she has enough Clue Tiles to be Suspected.

- **Do clue tiles carry over between Replicants?**  
  No. When a Replicant is eliminated, their clue tiles are discarded.

- **Can a Replicant win after deactivation?**  
  No. Must complete all 3 objectives **before** last move.

- **Can the Detective use black tickets to ride ferry?**  
  Yes—black ticket can be used as any transport type, including ferry (via subway ticket equivalent).
