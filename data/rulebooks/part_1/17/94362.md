## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
- The game is set in the world of Terrinoth, where players compete to achieve victory through scenario-specific objectives.  
- The core goal is defined by the Objective card chosen during setup.  
- In the "Civil War" scenario:  
  - The Opposing Army represents an external force composed of the player’s own units.  
  - You win if you acquire the Opposing Army objective card.  
  - You lose if you have no Unit cards left in your Barracks or if you are eliminated (20 damage to Home Realm).  

2. Components  
- Home Realm cards (one per player)  
- Barracks: faction-specific unit piles sorted by gold cost (1–4)  
- Strongholds (3 per faction)

3. Setup  
- Choose a scenario and place its Objective card faceup in the central play area.

- Collect neutral cards indicated by wax seals on the back of the Objective card. Place them in faceup piles in the central area.  
- Each player chooses a race and takes matching Home Realm, Strongholds, and Unit cards.  
- Organize each player’s Barracks: 5 faceup piles by ascending gold cost (1 to 4), including Mythic units (marked with gold shield).  
- Place neutral Cities (or Landmarks in "The Quest for Power") faceup in the central area, number based on player count.  
- Place 3 piles of Gold cards (1, 2, 3) in the central area.  
- Each player:  
  - Takes 5 Gold 1 cards and 3 Unit 1 cards to form starting deck.  
  - Shuffles and places deck to the left of Home Realm.  
  - Draws 5 cards for starting hand.  
- First player is youngest; play proceeds clockwise.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of:  
1. Each player takes a turn in clockwise order.  
2. After all turns, the first player resolves the Event Phase.  

Player Turn:  
1. Refresh: Rotate all exhausted Cities, Strongholds, and Rewards upright.  
2. Perform Actions (any order, any number):  
   - Spend Gold: Discard Gold cards to purchase Units, Strongholds, or Special cards from Barracks.  
   - Spend Influence: Exhaust Influence-generating cards to acquire Neutral cards or Gold cards from central area.  
   - Play Unit Action: Use a card’s Action ability (from hand or play area), then discard it. Cannot be used in combat.  
   - Combat Action: Initiate Battle or Siege.  
3. Discard Hand: Discard all cards in hand, or spend 1 Influence per card to retain it.  
4. Draw Phase: All players draw up to 5 cards. Reshuffle discard pile if deck is empty.  

Event Phase:  
- First player draws top Event card.  
- If Instant: resolve immediately, then discard.  
- If Enemy: place in central area; remains in play until defeated.  
- Resolve ongoing "Start of Event Phase" effects first.  
- After resolution, all players draw back up to 5 cards.  

5. Core Mechanics  
Combat:  
- Two types: Battle (vs. non-player target) and Siege (vs. another player).  

Battle Steps:  
1. Declare Target (City, Stronghold, Enemy, or Instant attacking you).  
2. Assault: Play Unit or Tactic cards one at a time. Use When Played abilities immediately.  
3. Attrition: If target has Attrition die icon, roll die; destroy that many of your participating units.  
4. Resolution: Apply Resolution abilities (attacker first), then compare total strength.  
   - Tie: attacker wins.  
5. End of Combat: Wounded units destroyed; surviving units go to discard pile.  

Siege Steps:  
1. Declare Target (player-controlled City or Home Realm; Strongholds cannot be targeted).  
2. Assault: Players alternate playing cards, starting with attacker. Announce total strength after each play.  
   - Both players pass to end Assault.  
3. Resolution: Attacker resolves Resolution abilities first, then defender.  
   - If target is City, add auto-defense bonus (+1 or more) to defender’s strength.  
   - Tie: defender wins.  
4. End of Combat: Same as Battle.  

Unit States:  
- Wounded: Rotated sideways during combat; destroyed at End of Combat.  
- Destroyed: Immediately removed from combat; returned to Barracks (or discarded if Mythic).  

Resources:  
- Gold: Generated by playing Gold cards or exhausting Gold-generating Rewards.  
- Influence: Generated by exhausting Cities, Strongholds, or Influence-generating Rewards.  
- Strength: Total shield value of units in combat.  

Special Rules for Civil War Scenario:  
- Opposing Army:  
  - Setup: Take one lowest-cost unit from your Barracks and place it in the Opposing Army.  
  - At end of each Event Phase: Move another lowest-cost unit from your Barracks to the Opposing Army.  
  - Then, the Opposing Army attacks your Home Realm (you defend as in Instant combat).  
  - You cannot target the Opposing Army unless under attack.  
  - When attacking you, the Opposing Army deploys all units immediately; unit abilities are ignored.  
  - You may freely target their units with your abilities during defense.  
  - Destroyed Mythical units of the Opposing Army are only removed from current combat (not permanently).  
  - When choosing units for the Opposing Army, always pick lowest cost.  
  - Opposing Army’s combat hand: 2 × Gold 1, 1 × Gold 2 (used to determine strength).  

Event Cards with Trophies (Not From This World variant):  
- Trophy: Awarded for defeating certain Instant or Enemy cards.  
- Player with most Trophies after last Event wins.  
- Sudden Quietness: Instant card that ends the game; player with most Trophies wins (tiebreaker: least Home Realm damage).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Victory is determined by the Objective card.  
- In Civil War:  
  - Win by acquiring the Opposing Army objective card.  
  - Lose if:  
    - No units left in Barracks  
    - Home Realm takes 20 damage (eliminated)  
- In Not From This World:  
  - Most Trophies after final Event wins.  
  - Sudden Quietness triggers immediate endgame.  
- Player elimination:  
  - At 20 damage, player is eliminated.  
  - Return neutral cards and gold to central area.  
  - Cities return to central area.  
  - Reward cards are removed from game.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I use Action abilities during combat?  
  A: No. Action abilities can only be used during Perform Actions phase, not in combat.  

- Q: What happens if I can’t fulfill a card effect (e.g., no low-cost units)?  
  A: Do as much as possible. If Retreating Vassals requires discarding 2×1G and 2×2G units but you lack them, discard what you can and take 1 damage per missing unit.  

- Q: Can I attack the same target more than once per round?  
  A: No. Only one attack per target per round.  

- Q: What happens when the Event deck runs out?  
  A: Shuffle Stage 2 cards from discard pile to form new deck. Stage 1 cards remain out.  

- Q: Can I save unused Gold or Influence?  
  A: No. Unspent resources are lost at the end of the action.  

- Q: How are ties resolved in combat?  
  A: Battle: attacker wins. Siege: defender wins.  

- Q: Can I use abilities after Attrition?  
  A: Yes. Resolution abilities are used after Attrition, before strength comparison.  

- Q: What happens to a defeated Enemy that grants a Reward?  
  A: The defeating player claims it and places it near their Home Realm for use.  

- Q: Can multiple players fight an Instant that attacks all players?  
  A: Yes. It attacks each player in turn order. First player to defeat it claims any Trophy or Reward; others skip it.
