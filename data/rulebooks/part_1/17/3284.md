3. Setup  
1. Each player selects a character deck and takes the corresponding figures.  
2. Choose one of the gameboards for the battle.  
3. Place each player’s main character on its designated starting space. Minor characters are placed on adjacent spaces.  
   - If players are using characters from the same side, place starting figures on opposite sides of the board.  
4. Place wound markers on the blue circles on each character’s health track.  
5. Each player draws 4 cards to form their starting hand.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn:  
1. Roll the die to determine movement.  
   - The result indicates how many characters may move and how far each may move.  
2. Move up to that number of characters, each up to the number of spaces shown on the die.  
   - Movement is orthogonal only (no diagonal).  
   - Two characters cannot occupy the same space.  
   - Friendly characters may move through each other.  
3. Spend 2 action points. Each action costs 1 point and may be repeated:  
   A) Draw a card (maximum hand size: 10 cards).  
   B) Heal a Character: Discard a minor character card to move the main character’s wound marker up 1 space (reduce damage by 1).  
   C) Play a Card:  
      - Special cards: Play face-up and resolve immediately.  
      - Other cards: Play face-down to initiate combat. The targeted opponent may respond by playing a card face-down.  
         - Compare values:  
           - If attacker’s value > defender’s: defender takes damage equal to the difference.  
           - If defender’s value ≥ attacker’s: no damage is dealt.  
      - A character is defeated when its wound marker reaches the red circle.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Turn-based play with alternating turns.  
- Movement governed by die roll: number of characters moved × movement range.  
- Action phase allows 2 actions from draw, heal, or play card.  
- Combat is resolved via hidden card value comparison.  
- Card play must match the character(s) involved (per character chart).  
- Wound markers track damage; reaching the red circle kills a character.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends immediately when one player’s main character is killed (wound marker reaches red circle).  
- The player who eliminates the opponent’s main character wins.  
- In team games, elimination of a main character does not remove the player from the game.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Team Games (4 or 6 players):**  
  - A player remains in the game even if their main character is defeated.  
  - If the main character is dead, the player may trade in the main character card to heal a minor character.  
  - Players may discuss strategy openly but may not look at each other’s hands.  
  - Rolling 'ALL' allows movement of only the rolling player’s characters, not teammates’.  

- **Master Play Variant:**  
  - Each player controls two characters using a shared hand.  
  - Starting hand: 2 cards from each character’s deck (4 total).  
  - When drawing a card, player must choose which character’s deck to draw from.  
  - Rolling 'ALL' allows movement of both characters controlled by the player.  
  - For Emperor Palpatine’s "Future Foreseen" card, only the Emperor’s draw pile may be searched.
