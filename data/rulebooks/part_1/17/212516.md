## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Set in the lands of Keydom, players act as keypers managing a team of skilled workers (keyples) over four seasons to develop their farm and village, hold fairs, and trade with boatmen. The goal is to create the most valuable economy by gathering resources, building and upgrading structures, holding fairs, and shipping goods. The player with the most points at the end of winter wins, with ties broken first by gems, then by other resources in a specified order.

2. Components

- 48 country building tiles: 12 farm, 36 village (21 are spring tiles)

3. Setup  
1. Place one country board per player in the center, each showing the spring keyp field and a unique player icon (1–4) for setup only.  
2. Place spring country tiles (with leaf icon) in the cloth bag. Draw 8 and place them face-up (build cost visible) near the boards.  
3. Set aside non-spring country tiles and winter fair tiles for later use.  
4. Randomly select 4 of the 6 boat tiles, place them with spring side face-up; set aside the other 2.  
5. Sort general supplies: raw materials, finished goods, wheat, gems, and animeeples.  
6. Each player takes:  
   - A player board in their color  
   - A keyp tile placed next to the top right of the board  
   - A keyper placed in the keyp area on the board  
   - 8 keyples: 1 each of boat, clay, farmer, forest, miner, quarry, and 2 white generalists  
   - 3 finished goods: 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 stone  
   - 1 fair tile each for spring, summer, and autumn (kept face-down on fairground spaces)  
7. Randomly determine the start player.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise. On a turn, a player may:  
  1. Play their keyper onto an empty keyp field of any country board.  
  2. Play a keyple onto a field (country board) or building (own board).  
  3. Lay down a keyple (if all keyples and keyper have been played).  
- After playing a keyper, lay down any keyples on your keyp tile to gain resources.  
- When a field is empty, the active player must invite others to join (clockwise from left).  
- A keyple may be laid down to work a second time, either by joining an existing keyple or via lay-down action.  
- The season ends when all players have played their keyper and all keyples. Then:  
  - All other players get one final lay-down action.  
  - Players may lay down forgotten keyples on their keyp tile.  
  - Players display resources for fairs.  
  - Animals must be housed or returned to supply.  
  - Players retrieve their keyper, claimed country board, and all keyples on it.  
  - Discard current country tile display.  
  - Refill display with 8 new tiles from the bag (non-spring tiles added to bag at start of summer).  
  - Randomly select 4 new boat tiles for the next season.  
  - Players simultaneously choose a layout for their country board showing the new season’s icon.  
  - Players with more than 8 keyples (9 in 2-player) place excess on their keyp tile.  
  - The last player to play a keyple or keyper becomes the start player for the next season.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Playing a Keyple**:  
  - On an empty field: gain 1 action/resource (2 if color-matched). Invite joiner; if joined, both gain 2 (3 if color-matched).  
  - On a field with one keyple (existing): must match color or be white. Lay down the existing keyple to gain 2 (3 if color-matched).  
  - On own building: gain 1 action/resource (2 if laying down existing keyple). Used for building, upgrading, or activating actions.  
- **Joining**: Only one joiner allowed per field. Joiner must match color of first keyple or be white.  
- **White Keyples**: Can represent any color. On a colored field, can be joined by white or field color. On uncolored field or building, only by white.  
- **Laying Down**:  
  - Only after playing all keyples and keyper.  
  - Can lay down a single keyple on own board or claimed board for 1–2 actions (2–3 if color-matched).  
  - Can lay down both keyples on a field to gain 2–3 actions for the active player (joiner does not gain extra).  
  - If no keyples on own board or claimed board, may lay down on any country board.  
- **Boat Actions**:  
  - Place a boat tile on an empty river space, then place a keyple.  
  - Each action: gain one resource shown or sell one for 2 shipping points.  
  - Light-blue or white keyple: 2 actions. With joiner: 3 actions total.  
  - Cannot gain and sell the same resource in one turn.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after winter. Score:  
  - Shipping track points  
  - Points from built farm and village tiles  
  - Points from displayed fair tiles (all seasons, including stacked winter fairs)  
- Scoring Rules:  
  - Resources and keyples can only score once.  
  - Buildings that score resources or keyples can do so a maximum of 4 times.  
  - Overbuilt buildings do not score.  
  - Buildings may contribute to multiple scoring conditions (e.g., Drainage, Pavements, Thatcher).  
- Tiebreakers: Most gems, then finished goods, wheat, raw materials, deer, wild boar, goats, chickens, horses, cows, pigs, sheep.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Color Matching**: Only applies on fields with colored borders. No bonus on country tile, build, discount build, or upgrade fields.  
- **White Resources**: Represent any type of raw material, finished good, or gem. Wheat can substitute for white raw/finished goods but not for gems or specific types.  
- **Resource Limits**: If supply runs out during joint actions, active player takes first, then joiner, alternating. No compensation if unavailable.  
- **Overbuilding**: Allowed once per plot. New tile covers old; old tile is inactive. Keyple on tile moves to new tile.  
- **Forgotten Keyp Tile**: If forgotten when playing keyper, may lay down at end of season after final lay-down actions.  
- **Winter Fairs**: Can be held in summer (4 pts), autumn (4 or 6 pts), or winter (6 pts), depending on side used and resources displayed.
