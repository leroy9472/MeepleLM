## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Stephenson's Rocket*, players assume the roles of railway barons in 1830s England, competing to build rail lines, invest in industries, and connect cities and towns. The goal is to earn the most Prestige points (★) through in-game and end-game scoring. Victory is achieved by strategically extending rail lines, leveraging share ownership, and optimizing investments and station placement.

### 2. Components  
- Game board (England map with hexes, cities, towns, and investment chart)  
- 7 plastic locomotives (one per rail line)  
- 60 regular track tiles  
- 16 connector tiles (for mergers)  
- 7 share tracks (one per rail line)  
- 72 industry cubes (18 per player, 4 types: steel, textiles, brewing, leather)  
- 28 stations (7 per player)  
- 9 passenger pawns  
- 32 player markers (8 per player: 7 for shares, 1 for prestige)  
- 12 city indicator cubes  
- 6 "X" signs (to mark dissolved lines)  
- Player boards (4)  
- Prestige track (on board)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board centrally.  
2. Position each locomotive on its matching starting town (by color).  
3. Each player selects a color and takes:  
   - 1 player board  
   - 7 stations  
   - 18 industry cubes (4 types × 4–5 each)  
   - 8 player markers (7 for share tracks, 1 for prestige track)  
4. Place one player marker (face-down “+10”) on the “0” of each of the 7 share tracks.  
5. Place the final marker (face-down “+100”) on the “0/100” of the Prestige track.  
6. Place stations and cubes on player boards.  
7. Place city indicators, passenger pawns, and “X” signs near the board.  
8. Place 60 track tiles and 16 connector tiles in supply.  
9. Randomly select the starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On each turn, perform **two actions** from:  
- **Extend a Rail Line**  
- **Invest in Industries**  
- **Build a Station**  

Same action may be taken twice, **except** a player may not extend the **same rail line** twice in one turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### A) Extend a Rail Line  
1. **Move a Locomotive**  
   - From starting town: may move to any adjacent hex.  
   - Afterward: must move forward into one of three front hexes (straight or slight curve).  
   - Cannot move into:  
     - Cities, towns, track tiles, or another locomotive.  
     - A hex adjacent to **two or more other rail lines**.  
   - May move into a hex containing a **station** (links station to line).  
   - **Receive 1 share** in the rail line (move marker up share track).  

2. **Veto Round**  
   - Any player with a share in the line may call a veto.  
   - Bidding order: starts with player to the left of active player, proceeds clockwise.  
   - Players may bid shares to redirect the locomotive to a valid hex.  
   - Each bid must **exceed** the previous, **except** the active player, who may **match** the highest bid.  
   - Winner pays bid (marker moves down), places locomotive on their chosen hex.  
   - Active player may only **defend** their original choice; cannot switch to a different new hex.  

3. **Place Track Tile**  
   - Place a tile on the hex the locomotive just vacated (unless it was the starting town).  
   - If merging, a connector tile may be used; if replacing a regular tile, **remove it from the game** (ensures max 60 tiles).  

4. **Receive Passenger Pawn**  
   - If the **active player** moves the locomotive into **another player’s station**, they gain 1 passenger pawn.  
   - **Only if** the active player **wins the veto** (or no veto occurs).  
   - Max 9 passenger pawns in game; once all taken, no more awarded.  

#### B) Invest in Industries  
- Place one industry cube on any empty space in the city investment chart (by city and industry type).  
- Cubes are permanent; cannot be moved or removed.  
- Supply is unlimited (use substitutes if needed).  

#### C) Build a Station  
- Place or **move** one of your stations.  
- Must be on an **empty hex** (no cities, towns, tracks, locomotives, or stations).  
- Must **not** be adjacent to:  
  - Another station  
  - A locomotive  
- **Clarification**: Stations **on track tiles** are **fixed** and cannot be moved. Only **free-standing** stations may be relocated.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### In-Game Scoring  
Triggered when a locomotive move causes:  
1. **Connect to a City** (first time for that line)  
   - Player with **most industry cubes** in that city: **2★**  
   - Player with **second most**: **1★**  
   - If tied for 1st: sum 1st+2nd, divide evenly, round down.  
   - If tied for 2nd: divide 2nd-place points evenly, round down.  

2. **Connect to a Railway Town** (first time for that line)  
   - Player with **most stations on the line**: **1★ per connected city and town** (including starting towns)  
   - Player with **second most**: **half**, rounded down  
   - Starting towns do not trigger scoring but count in value.  

3. **Merge Two Rail Lines**  
   - Locomotive’s line is **dissolved**.  
   - Player with **most shares in dissolved line**: **1★ per connected city and town**  
   - Player with **second most**: **half**, rounded down  
   - **Dissolve line**:  
     - Remove locomotive, place track tile  
     - Place "X" on share track  
   - **Share conversion**:  
     - All players convert shares at **2:1** (2 old = 1 new in surviving line)  
     - Single shares lost  
     - Use supplementary shares if needed  

**Order of Scoring**: If multiple triggers, resolve in order:  
1. City  
2. Town  
3. Merger  

#### Isolated Rail Lines  
A line is **isolated** if:  
- Its locomotive **cannot reach** any new city, railway town, or starting town  
- It **cannot merge** with another line  

**Effects**:  
- No shares awarded when extending  
- Shareholders keep shares  
- “X” placed on share track  
- **Note**: A line may still be extended, but gains no share  
- **Clarification**: Even if another line could merge into it, it’s still isolated  

#### End Game  
Game ends **immediately after** a player’s turn if:  
- **6 of 7 rail lines** are **dissolved or isolated**, OR  
- **All 60 track tiles** have been placed  

Then proceed to end-game scoring.  

#### End-Game Scoring  
1. **Passenger Pawns**  
   - Most: **6★**  
   - Second: **3★**  

2. **Industries**  
   - Remove all industry cubes from **unconnected cities** (no indicator cube)  
   - For **each industry type** (steel, textiles, brewing, leather):  
     - Most cubes: **6★**  
     - Second: **3★**  

3. **Stations (per undissolved line)**  
   - For each non-dissolved line:  
     - Most stations: **1★ per connected city and town**  
     - Second: **half**, rounded down  

4. **Shares (per undissolved line)**  
   - For each non-dissolved line:  
     - Most shares: **1★ per connected city and town**  
     - Second: **half**, rounded down  

**Ties**:  
- Tied for 1st: sum 1st+2nd, divide evenly, round down  
- Tied for 2nd: divide 2nd-place points evenly, round down  
- If no 2nd place, only 1st is awarded

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a line be isolated even if another can merge into it?**  
  Yes. Isolation depends on whether **its own locomotive** can trigger a merge or connection.  

- **Does moving adjacent to a starting town cause a merger?**  
  No. Only adjacency to **track or locomotive** of another line triggers merger.  

- **What if only one tile remains and a merger requires a 61st?**  
  Merger still occurs. Game cannot end mid-action. Scoring proceeds normally.  

- **Can supplementary shares be used in veto bids?**  
  No. Only **real shares** may be used. Supplementary shares are for mergers only.  

- **When is a share received during extension?**  
  **Before** veto round. Active player may use it in bidding.  

- **Can a station on a track be moved?**  
  No. Only **unlinked** (free-standing) stations may be moved.  

- **Are stations limited to 7 per player?**  
  Yes. No more than 7 stations per player.  

- **Do railway towns score only once?**  
  No. Each **new rail line** connecting triggers scoring.
