## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
XENOSHYFT: ONSLAUGHT is a cooperative deck-building game where players take on the role of NorTec Division commanders defending a planetary Base from waves of alien threats. The goal is to survive 9 Rounds of escalating Enemy assaults across 3 Waves. If the Base survives, the players win. If the Base HP is reduced to 0 or below, the players lose.

### 2. Components

- **Troops**: Units deployed to combat Enemies. Have Power (damage output) and HP (hit points).  
- **Items**: Cards of various types (Armor, Weapon, Grafting, Medical, Psychogenics, Technology) used to equip Troops or play as Instants.  
- **Enemies**: Alien threats deployed each round. Have Power, HP, and often Reveal or ongoing effects.  
- **Encounter Decks**: Separate decks for Waves 1, 2, and 3, each containing Enemy cards.  
- **Item Stacks**: Shared market of available Item cards to purchase.  
- **Base**: Shared HP tracker (default 15 HP per player).  
- **Tokens**: Damage tokens, Ability tokens, and Wave Tracker.  
- **Xenosathem Cards**: Resource cards used to purchase Items and Troops.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each Round follows these phases in order:

#### 1. Draw Phase  
- Draw up to 6 cards (maximum hand size).  

#### 2. Acquire Resources Phase  
- Gain 1 Xenosathem card.  
- Players may purchase any number of Items or Troops from the market using Xenosathem.  
  - Purchased cards go to hand.  
  - Unused Xenosathem is lost.  
- **Xenosathem Upgrades**: During Wrap-Up Phase, players may combine lower-cost Xenosathem cards into higher ones (e.g., two 3-cost → one 6-cost), if allowed by current Wave.

#### 3. Deployment Phase  
**Simultaneous deployment.**  
- **Deploy Troops**:  
  - Place up to 4 Troops in unoccupied Troop Zones (1 per zone).  
  - May deploy in own or another player’s lane. Owner of the lane owns the card.  
  - Equip 1 Weapon and/or 1 Armor-type Item per Troop (placed underneath).  
- **Deploy Enemies**:  
  - **Round 1**: 3 Enemies per player (face-down).  
  - **Round 2**: 4 Enemies per player.  
  - **Round 3**: 4 Enemies per player, including Bosses:  
    - 1–2 players: Replace 1 random Enemy with 1 random Boss of current Wave.  
    - 3–4 players: Replace 2 random Enemies with 2 random Bosses.  
  - Shuffle and deal face-down into Enemy Zones.  
  - Extra Enemies may be added beyond 4 via card effects.

#### 4. Combat Phase  
**Sequence per Enemy (right to left):**  
a) **Reveal Enemy**: Flip rightmost face-down Enemy.  
   - Resolve Reveal effect immediately (cannot be prevented unless card states so).  
b) **Reaction**:  
   - Players may use Special Abilities or play Instant cards.  
   - No limit on reactions.  
   - Use blue Ability Token to mark used abilities.  
c) **Fight**:  
   - Troop and Enemy deal damage equal to Power simultaneously (unless ability changes order).  
   - Apply damage with red tokens.  
   - If damage ≥ HP, unit is killed and discarded.  
   - Resolve any "on kill" or "on death" effects.  
d) **Advancement Phase**:  
   - Surviving Troop and/or Enemy advance to next unoccupied zone.  
   - Repeat Combat Phase for next Enemy (rightmost).  
e) **Aftermath**:  
   - If all Troops defeated and Enemies remain:  
     - Flip and resolve all face-down Enemies.  
     - Players get one final chance to react.  
     - Surviving Enemies deal damage to Base equal to their Power.  
   - Base HP ≤ 0 → Loss.

#### 5. Wrap-Up Phase  
- Discard any cards from hand or lane (optional).  
- Re-arrange surviving Troops and Equipment.  
- Remove Ability Tokens.  
- **Wound Tokens remain** on Troops until healed.  
- **Upgrade Xenosathem** (if eligible).  
- **Advance Wave Tracker** by 1 round.  
  - On Wave change, replace Encounter Deck (Wave 1 → 2 → 3).  
  - After Round 9 (end of Wave 3): **Players win**.  
- **Replenish Item Market**: Replace empty stacks with new random Items.  
- **Pass First Player** to the left.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Damage & Death**:  
  - Damage is tracked with tokens.  
  - Unit dies when damage ≥ HP.  
  - Death effects resolve immediately.  
- **Equipment Rules**:  
  - A Troop may have **1 Weapon**, **1 Armor**, and **1 Grafting** card equipped.  
  - Some Items are multi-type (e.g., Manticore Exoskeleton: Weapon/Armor/Grafting).  
  - Equipment is discarded when Troop dies, unless effect says otherwise.  
- **Burn**: Remove card from game (not discard). Cannot be retrieved.  
- **Instant Cards**: Can be played during Reaction step. Some Troops/Divisions allow playing as Instant outside normal timing.  
- **Simultaneous Effects**:  
  - Enemy effects resolve first.  
  - Player effects may be resolved in any order.  
- **Lane Management**:  
  - Max 4 Troops per lane.  
  - Abilities may move or redeploy Troops, but max still applies.  
  - Enemies may exceed 4 via card effects.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition**: Survive 9 Rounds (complete Wave 3).  
- **Loss Condition**: Base HP ≤ 0 at any time.  
- **Training Mode (Optional)**:  
  - Start Base at 0 HP.  
  - Track total damage taken.  
  - Goal: Minimize total damage over games.  
- No formal scoring outside Training Mode.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you play multiple Instants?** Yes, during Reaction phase.  
- **Do Troops heal between rounds?** No, unless card effect (e.g., Med Bay Wave 3).  
- **Can you equip two of the same type?** No. Only 1 Weapon, 1 Armor, 1 Grafting per Troop.  
- **Do Reveal effects happen if Enemy is killed before Combat?** Yes. Reveal effects always resolve.  
- **Can you deploy to another player’s lane?** Yes. That player owns the Troop/Item.  
- **What happens if Encounter Deck runs out?** Shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
- **Can a Troop become an Enemy?** Yes (e.g., Worm Host). It loses its abilities and acts as Enemy. When killed, returns to owner’s discard pile.  
- **Can you upgrade Xenosathem in Round 3 of Wave 2?** No. Upgrade only if new Wave allows higher-cost cards (e.g., Wave 3 allows 6-cost, so upgrade possible at end of Round 1, Wave 3).
