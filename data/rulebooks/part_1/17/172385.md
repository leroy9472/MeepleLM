## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the role of Roman architects constructing the city of Augusta Trevorum, including the monumental Porta Nigra. The objective is to earn the most victory points (VP) through strategic building, collecting building cards, and achieving majorities in construction zones. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.

- 1 round marker  

3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Place all components (bricks, coins, torches, influence tokens, VP markers) in reserves next to the board. The coin reserve is the bank.  
3. Shuffle the 10 supply cards and place face-down as a draw pile.  
4. Place the round marker on the first space of the round track.  
5. Shuffle the 20 building cards and place face-down as a draw pile. Reveal 6 face-up in the building card display.  
6. Shuffle the 28 honour cards and place face-down as a draw pile. Reveal 14 face-up in two rows of 7 in the honour card display.  
7. Each player receives:  
   - 20 Sesterces and 1 torch token (placed in play area)  
   - 1 player board, 1 VP marker (set to 0), 3 action markers, 5 Romans (placed next to board)  
   - 1 master builder (placed next to board)  
   - 1 action card deck (8 cards of matching colour)  
     - In 4-player games, remove the action card marked “2 or 3 players only”  
   - Shuffle the deck and draw 2 cards into hand (kept secret)  
8. Remaining Romans are placed in a common reserve.  
9. Randomly determine the starting player.  
10. Return unused components to the box.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise, with each player taking turns.  
- A round ends when all players have played all action cards.  
- After each round (except the last), conduct intermediate scoring and begin a new round.  
- The game ends normally after:  
  - 3 rounds (2 players)  
  - 2 rounds (3 or 4 players)  
- The game may end prematurely if:  
  - The brick reserve and market are empty during a player’s turn  
  - A player places their 15th building element (no Romans left)  
  In either case, that player scores 5 VP immediately, finishes their turn, and all other players take one final turn before final scoring.

5. Core Mechanics  
Each player’s turn consists of two phases:

**Phase 1: Refill Phase**  
- **Bricks**: If fewer than 7 bricks are in the market, draw supply cards and place 1 brick in each shop marked “+1” until at least 14 bricks are present. Shuffle discards if the draw pile is empty.  
- **Building Cards**: If fewer than 6 cards are in the display, refill to 6 from the draw pile. No refill if pile is exhausted.  
- **Honour Cards**: If fewer than 14 cards are in the display, refill to 14 from the draw pile. No refill if pile is exhausted.

**Phase 2: Action Phase**  
- At the beginning of the first turn, place your master builder in any quarter.  
- Play one action card from your hand. The number of torches (2 or 3) indicates how many actions you may take from the card.  
- You may only perform actions (A–E) shown on the card, and each action may be used only once.  
- Cover used actions with action markers.  
- You may use torch tokens from your supply to perform additional actions (one torch per extra action).  
- Actions may be performed in any order.  
- Influence actions may be taken at any point during your turn.

**Available Actions**  
A. **Buy 1 Brick**  
- Move master builder clockwise to the shop’s quarter (1 Sesterce per border crossed). White shop is accessible from any quarter.  
- Pay brick cost: Black (1), Blue (2), Red (3), Yellow (4), White (5)  
- If the required shop is empty, the buy-icon acts as a grey “any colour” icon.  
- Place brick in matching colour slot on player board.

B. **Place 1 Building Element**  
- Move master builder to the quarter (1 Sesterce per border).  
- Assemble a stack of 1–8 bricks of one colour matching the building spot.  
  - Porta Nigra spots: 3–8 bricks of the shown colour.  
- Place 1 Roman on top (must have Romans available).  
- Score VPs:  
  - Other buildings: as shown on spot  
  - Porta Nigra: 1 (Black), 2 (Blue), 3 (Red), 4 (Yellow), 5 (White) per brick  
- Claim matching building card (if available): same building icon and brick colour.  
- Place building element on spot.  
- Trigger Master Builder Reward if total bricks in that building reach a new multiple of 3.

C. **Take 1 Influence Token**  
- Take 1 influence token from the reserve.

D. **Take 1 Torch Token**  
- Take 1 torch token from the reserve.

E. **Take Coins**  
- Take 3, 4, or 5 Sesterces as shown.

**Special Action: Torches to Coins**  
- Forfeit one action on your card or return 1 torch token to gain 1 Sesterce.

**Influence Actions (during your turn)**  
- Buy 1 honour card (max 1 per turn)  
- Pay 2 influence tokens to take 1 Roman from reserve  
- Pay 2 influence tokens to perform “Place 1 Building Element” action

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Intermediate Scoring (after each round except last)**  
- 2-player: Each player scores VPs and/or coins equal to total bricks placed.  
- 3/4-player: Each player scores VPs and/or coins equal to double the total bricks placed.  
- Distribution is player’s choice between coins and VPs.  
- After scoring:  
  - Player with fewest VPs chooses next starting player (youngest in case of tie)  
  - Move round marker forward  
  - Shuffle discard pile into new draw pile  
  - Draw 2 action cards  

**Final Scoring Sequence**  
1. **Set Collection Scoring**  
   - Form sets of 1–4 building cards (including substitute cards), each showing a different building.  
   - Score:  
     - 1 card: 2 VP  
     - 2 cards: 6 VP  
     - 3 cards: 12 VP  
     - 4 cards: 20 VP  

2. **Final Scoring Cards**  
   - Score VPs shown on any final scoring cards in play area.  
   - Discarded cards (used to purchase higher-tier cards) are not scored.

3. **Play Area Scoring**  
   - Score 1 VP for:  
     - Each Roman  
     - Every 3 Sesterces  
     - Each influence token  
     - Each torch token  
     - Each brick on player board  

4. **Majority Scoring (by building)**  
   - **Basilica**: Scored by row (A and B separately)  
     - 1st: 12 VP, 2nd: 6 VP  
   - **Amphitheatre**: Scored by row (A, B, C separately)  
     - Row A: 1st: 15 VP, 2nd: 7 VP  
     - Row B: 1st: 12 VP, 2nd: 6 VP  
     - Row C: 1st: 9 VP, 2nd: 5 VP  
   - **City Wall**: Entire building  
     - 1st: 20 VP, 2nd: 10 VP  
   - **Porta Nigra**: Scored by level (3–8 bricks high)  
     - Each level: 1st and 2nd place scored individually  
     - Ties: higher valued bricks win (value = purchase cost)  
     - Unbreakable tie: tied players receive points for next lower place (tie for 1st → both get 2nd place points; tie for 2nd → no points)

**Tiebreaker for All Majorities**  
- In case of brick count tie, the player with the most valued building element wins.  
- Value determined by number and cost of bricks (White = 5, Yellow = 4, Red = 3, Blue = 2, Black = 1).

**Game End Trigger**  
- If brick supply is exhausted or a player places their 15th building element, that player scores 5 VP and finishes their turn. All others take one final turn before final scoring.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **White Bricks**: Can substitute for any colour when assembling building elements. Scored as the colour they represent.  
- **Master Builder Movement**: Only clockwise; 1 Sesterce per border crossed. Cannot move if insufficient funds.  
- **Empty Shops**: A buy-icon for an empty shop becomes a grey “any colour” icon.  
- **Infinite Reserves**: Coins, torches, and influence tokens are infinite (use substitutes if needed).  
- **VP Track Overflow**: Use “+100/+200” marker if VP marker exceeds 99.
