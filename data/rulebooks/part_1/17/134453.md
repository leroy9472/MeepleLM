## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Each player constructs a 4×4 planetary grid inspired by *The Little Prince*. The characters placed in the four corners of the grid determine how the player scores points. The goal is to earn the most points by strategically placing tiles that fulfill the scoring conditions of the corner characters.

### 2. Components  
- 64 tiles total, divided into four types by back color:  
  - Blue-backed tiles (for corner placements)  
  - White-backed tiles (for central placements)  
  - Left-side rising horizon tiles (uphill edge on left)  
  - Right-side descending horizon tiles (downhill edge on right)  
- Each tile features various thematic elements:  
  - Characters (e.g., Vain Man, King, Little Prince)  
  - Objects (e.g., roses, lampposts, volcanoes, Baobab trees)  
  - Animals (sheep in white, gray, brown; other creatures)  
  - Celestial elements (sun, stars, moon)  
- Scoring track (on the back of the box)  
- Player color tokens  

### 3. Setup  
- Sort tiles face down by back type into four stacks.  
- Remove tiles based on player count:  
  - 5 players: use all tiles  
  - 4 players: remove 4 tiles from each stack  
  - 3 players: remove 8 tiles from each stack  
  - 2 players: remove 8 tiles from each stack  
- Place remaining tiles in four face-down stacks.  
- Choose starting player (youngest player recommended).  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

#### For 3, 4, or 5 Players:  
1. Starting player selects one of the four stacks and draws a number of tiles equal to the number of players.  
2. They place one tile face up in front of them (to later place on their planet).  
3. They pass the remaining face-up tiles to any other player.  
4. Each receiving player takes one tile for their planet and passes the rest to any player who hasn’t received a tile this round.  
5. The player who receives the last tile becomes the starting player for the next round.  
6. Repeat until all tiles are placed.  

#### For 2 Players:  
1. Starting player chooses a stack and draws 3 tiles (kept secret).  
2. They place two tiles face up and one face down between them (optionally, all three may be placed face up).  
3. The other player chooses one of the three tiles (including the face-down one, without looking) to place on their planet.  
4. The first player then takes one of the two remaining tiles for their planet.  
5. The leftover tile is discarded.  
6. Players alternate who starts each round.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Planet Construction**:  
  - Players build a 4×4 grid.  
  - Tiles can be placed in any empty space; gaps are allowed during play and filled as tiles become available.  
  - Blue-backed tiles are typically used in corners (but not required).  
  - White-backed tiles are typically used in the center.  
  - Horizon tiles (left rising, right descending) can be placed anywhere but affect visual continuity.  

- **Baobab Tree Mechanic**:  
  - If a player ever has **three or more Baobab trees** visible on their planet, **all tiles with Baobab trees are immediately flipped face down**.  
  - These face-down tiles no longer contribute to character-based scoring (except for the Drunkard).  
  - The count resets; if the player later collects three Baobabs again (after flipping back), they are flipped down again.  

- **Corner Characters & Scoring Rules**:  
  Each corner tile features a character who grants points based on specific criteria:  

  | Character | Scoring Rule |
  |---------|-------------|
  | **Vain Man** | 4 points per snake |
  | **Geographer** | 1 point per tile that is **not a volcano** |
  | **Astronomer** | 2 points per sun |
  | **King** | 14 points if exactly **1 rose**, 7 points if exactly **2 roses**, 0 if 3+ roses |
  | **Lamplighter** | 1 point per lamppost |
  | **Hunter** | 3 points per **type of animal** present (sheep of any color counts as one animal type) |
  | **Drunkard** | 3 points per **face-down tile** (from Baobab flips) |
  | **Businessman** | Depends on sheep color shown on his desk:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;• White: 2 points per white sheep  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;• Gray: 3 points per gray sheep  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;• Brown: 5 points per brown sheep |
  | **Gardener** | 7 points per tree (max 2 trees allowed; cannot score for 3+) |
  | **Turkish Astronomer** | 1 point per **large star** (including those on corner tiles) |
  | **Little Prince** | 1 point per box + 3 points per **sheep color present** (white, gray, brown) |

- **Volcano Penalty**:  
  - The player(s) with the **most volcanoes** lose **1 point per volcano** they have.  
  - If tied for most volcanoes, **all tied players** suffer the penalty.  

- **Variant – Hidden Corners**:  
  Players may choose to keep their four corner tiles **face down** until scoring. This increases uncertainty and bluffing.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Condition**: The game ends when every player has filled their 4×4 grid (16 tiles).  
- **Scoring Process**:  
  - Reveal all corner characters.  
  - Score points for each corner based on its character’s rule.  
  - Apply volcano penalty.  
  - Use the scoring track on the box back to tally points.  
- **Winning**:  
  - The player with the **most points** wins.  
  - **Tiebreaker**: The player with **fewer volcanoes** wins.  
    - If still tied, shared victory (no further tiebreakers specified).  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place tiles non-adjacent during play?**  
  Yes. Gaps are allowed. The grid does not need to be connected during construction.  
- **Can I have the same character in multiple corners?**  
  Yes. Each instance scores independently.  
- **What happens if I have 4 Baobabs?**  
  As soon as the third Baobab appears, all Baobab tiles are flipped face down. The fourth does not trigger a new flip unless re-exposed later.  
- **Do face-down tiles count for anything?**  
  Only for the **Drunkard** (3 points each). They do not count for other scoring conditions.  
- **Are corner tiles included in Geographer’s count?**  
  Yes. The Geographer scores for **all non-volcano tiles**, including corners.  
- **Do stars on corner tiles count for Turkish Astronomer?**  
  Yes. All large stars on the planet, including corner tiles, count.  
- **Can I look at the face-down tile in 2-player mode before choosing?**  
  No. The other player may choose the face-down tile but **cannot look at it** beforehand.
