## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Sol: Last Days of a Star*, the sun is nearing supernova due to increasing instability. Players control planetary factions that must harvest energy and momentum from the dying star to propel their arks to safety. The goal is to maximize momentum on the momentum track before the 13th solar flare triggers the sun’s explosion. The player whose ark has the most momentum at that point survives; all others perish.

### 2. Components  
- Game board (1–5 player sides)  
- 5 player sets:  
  - 1 mothership  
  - 13 sundivers (8 in hold, 5 in reserve)  
  - 5 solar gates  
  - 3 energy nodes  
  - 3 sundiver foundries  
  - 3 transmit towers  
  - 1 ark (ring)  
  - 1 movement marker  
  - 1 player hold (mat)  
  - 1 homeworld tile  
  - 1 player aid  
- 89 energy cubes  
- 96 instability cards (7 suits of 13, including solar flares)  
- 5 trigger flare cards  
- 8 trigger event cards  
- 30 instability effect cards  
- 7 suit tokens  
- 1 momentum track + instability spiral  
- 1 instability marker  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Board Setup**:  
   - Choose 1–4 or 5-player side of the board.  
   - Place instability marker on space 13 of the instability spiral.  
   - Place momentum track nearby with all arks on space 0.  
   - Place energy cube piles in opposite corners.  

2. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player selects a color and takes:  
     - 8 sundivers, 3 energy cubes → placed in hold  
     - Movement marker on space 3 of homeworld tile  
     - Remaining pieces → reserve  
   - Place motherships equidistantly on orbital track, leaving a larger gap in front of the first player (indicates turn order).  

3. **Instability Deck**:  
   - Include all solar flare (red) cards.  
   - Add one non-red suit per player, plus one extra if *Vestigial Structures* is not used.  
   - Shuffle and place deck near the spiral.  
   - Select matching number of instability effect cards (based on suits used).  
   - Assign suit tokens randomly or by choice to determine effects.  
   - Display effect cards face-up.  

4. **Optional: Vestigial Structures (recommended for new players)**:  
   - In turn order, each player places one gate and one station (node, foundry, or tower) on the board:  
     - Gate: between inner orbit and convective layer  
     - Station: in outer orbit, inner orbit, or convective layer  
   - After placing first station, set movement marker to 4.  
   - Reduce number of suits in deck by one (i.e., use only player count suits + solar flares).  

5. **Optional: Trigger Events**:  
   - Shuffle 1–5 trigger flare cards into the deck.  
   - Choose one trigger event card and display it face-up.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn:  
1. **Optional**: Play one instability card from your hold (if available).  
2. **Main Action**: Choose **one** of:  
   - **Move**  
   - **Convert**  
   - **Activate**  
3. **Draw Cards**: Draw instability cards based on actions taken (convert, activate, hurl).  
   - Resolve solar flares immediately (in order: Down Spiral, Unstable Energy, Orbital Activation).  
   - Keep one card face-up in your hold; discard the rest.  
4. **Orbit**: Advance your mothership one space counterclockwise → next player’s turn.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Movement  
- Base movement: 3 points.  
- +1 point for each layer (outer orbit, inner orbit, convective, radiative, core) where you own **at least one station**.  
- Spend movement points on:  
  - **Launch**: 1 point to move sundiver from hold to any space adjacent to your mothership.  
  - **Fly**: 1 point per space moved.  
    - Cannot cross barriers (thick black lines) without a gate.  
    - Circular (clockwise/counterclockwise) and radial moves outside the sun do not require gates.  
  - **Hurl**: 1 point per sundiver in **core** to hurl into heart → vaporized, gain 2 momentum per sundiver.  
    - Draw 1 instability card per sundiver hurled.  
    - If card is a solar flare, gain +1 momentum.  

- **Gate Use**:  
  - If you use another player’s gate, they gain 1 energy (max 1 per turn, regardless of usage).  
  - You gain no benefit from your own gates.  

#### Convert  
- Sacrifice sundivers in specific patterns to build a structure. Only **one conversion per turn**.  
- Structures built go from reserve to board; sacrificed sundivers go to **reserve**.  
- **Patterns**:  
  - **Solar Gate**: 2 sundivers radially adjacent → gate from deeper space to next layer down.  
  - **Energy Node**: 2 sundivers with one space gap circularly → node in center.  
  - **Sundiver Foundry**: 2 adjacent sundivers circularly → foundry in either space.  
  - **Transmit Tower**: 3 sundivers in radial line across layers → tower in deepest space.  
- **Instability Cards Drawn**:  
  - Convective layer: 1 card  
  - Radiative layer: 2 cards  
  - Core: 3 cards  
  - Gate: based on deepest layer it connects.  

- **Deconstruct Rule**: If you start your turn with no sundivers in hold or on board, deconstruct one of your stations/gates → return to reserve, add 2 sundivers from reserve to hold. Adjust movement if layer is emptied.  

#### Activate  
- Activate **all stations of one type** (e.g., all foundries) where you have a sundiver present.  
- Each station activated **once per turn**.  
- **Process**:  
  1. Recall activating sundiver to **hold** (not reserve).  
  2. Activator receives **base** reward.  
  3. Owner may take **bonus** reward.  
  4. If owner declines, activator may take bonus.  
- **Rewards by Layer**:  

| Layer         | Energy Node (Base/Bonus) | Foundry (Base/Bonus) | Tower (Base/Bonus) |
|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Outer Orbit   | 1 / 0                    | 1 / 1                | 1 / 1              |
| Inner Orbit   | 1 / 1                    | 1 / 1                | 1 / 1              |
| Convective    | 2 / 1                    | 2 / 1                | 2 / 1              |
| Radiative     | 3 / 2                    | 3 / 2                | 3 / 2              |
| Core          | 5 / 3                    | 5 / 3                | 5 / 3              |

- **Requirements**:  
  - Foundry: 1 energy per sundiver built. Must have sufficient sundivers in reserve.  
  - Tower: 1 energy per momentum point transmitted.  
- **All-or-Nothing**: Must fulfill full base (activator) and full bonus (if taken).  

- **Instability Cards Drawn**: 1/2/3 per station in convective/radiative/core.  

#### Instability Cards & Effects  
- Draw cards after convert, activate, or hurl in sun layers or via hurling.  
- **Solar Flare Effects** (resolve immediately):  
  1. **Down Spiral**: Move instability marker inward.  
  2. **Unstable Energy**: Players with ≥13 energy lose half (rounded down).  
  3. **Orbital Activation**: All outer orbit stations may be activated by their owners (no sundiver needed). Foundries/towers still require energy.  
- **Keep One Card**: Choose one drawn card to keep in hold for future use.  
- **Using Instability Cards**:  
  - May play one per turn **in addition** to main action.  
  - Must have been earned on a prior turn.  
  - Discard after use.  
  - Effects depend on suit token assigned at setup.  

#### Key Instability Effects (from provided list)  
- **Accelerate**: Advance all motherships forward a chosen number of spaces.  
- **Augment**: When activating one station, each extra sundiver (any color) beyond the activating one increases base reward by depth-based amount (1/1/1/2/3).  
- **Blight**: Activate another player’s mothership → add 3 of your sundivers to their hold (must be adjacent). Replaces your activation. You may later launch these from their mothership.  
- **Cascade**: Perform an extra convert action; sundivers are **recalled** (not sacrificed).  
- **Catapult**: Each of your sundivers may cross one gate for free this turn.  
- **Ceremony**: Gain 1 energy for each sundiver launched into outer orbit.  
- **Channel**: For each card drawn, spend 1 energy to gain 1 momentum. All-or-nothing.  
- **Cluster**: Twice this turn, spend 1 movement to fly **all** your sundivers in one space as a single unit.  
- **Duplicate**: Double number of sundivers built this turn. Extra ones cost no energy.  
- **Fuel**: Up to 3 times, spend 1 energy to gain 3 movement points.  
- **Hatch**: In a space with your and opponent’s sundiver, replace theirs with 2 of yours. Theirs returns to hold.  
- **Hyperdrive**: If moving only one sundiver, double movement and gain 1 energy per 3 spaces flown.  
- **Invade**: Sacrifice 2 sundivers (3 for towers) to convert another player’s station to your color. You must have that station type in reserve. Previous owner gains sundivers.  
- **Juggernaut**: Fly a station as a sundiver. Can hurl it → station vaporized.  
- **Metamorphosis**: After activating your station, change it to any other type.  
- **Motivate**: Immediately activate a station after converting it. No extra card draw.  
- **Passage**: Choose one sundiver. Gain 1 free momentum for each **unique** gate it crosses this turn.  
- **Pillar**: Before drawing, choose a suit. Gain 3 momentum per card of that suit drawn.  
- **Portal**: Your sundivers may launch from any mothership. All mothership-adjacent spaces are adjacent to each other.  
- **Procreate**: Place 1 sundiver from reserve into **each** space containing 2+ of your sundivers. All-or-nothing: must have enough sundivers to place on all qualifying spaces.  
- **Pulse**: Activate all your stations in inner and outer orbit. No sundivers required.  
- **Puncture**: Fly sundiver through barrier → sacrifice it, place gate there. Draw cards as if converted.  
- **Sacrifice (Instability Effect)**: Vaporize all sundivers on one foundry. Each owner gains 2 momentum per sundiver lost.  
- **Squeeze**: Activate your station. If draw solar flare → get base only, station destroyed. Else → double base and bonus.  
- **Synchronize**: Gain 1 free momentum per station activated.  
- **Teleport**: Spend 3 movement to move sundiver to any space. Can do twice if ≥6 movement.  
- **Transcend**: Ignore barriers during movement.  
- **Tribute**: Choose your station. For each sundiver on it, its owner gives you 1 energy.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Scoring**: Momentum is tracked on the momentum track via:  
  - Hurling sundivers (2 momentum each +1 if solar flare drawn)  
  - Transmitting energy via towers (1:1)  
  - Instability effects (e.g., Synchronize, Passage, Pillar)  
- **End Game**: When the **13th solar flare** is drawn:  
  1. Resolve solar flare effects (including orbital activation).  
  2. Game ends immediately.  
  3. Player with **highest momentum** wins.  
  4. **No tiebreaker**: If tied, all tied players win together.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I activate stations in the core without a sundiver?**  
  Only during **Orbital Activation** (from solar flare) — but only for **outer orbit** stations. Core requires sundiver.  
- **Can I use my own gate for free?**  
  No cost, but no energy reward. Gate benefits only apply to others using your gate.  
- **Can I convert and then activate the same station on the same turn?**  
  Only if you have **Motivate** effect. Otherwise, activation requires a sundiver already present.  
- **What happens if I can’t fulfill “all-or-nothing” for Procreate?**  
  You cannot use the ability. Must have enough sundivers to place one in every qualifying space.  
- **Can I use Portal to launch from any mothership, including opponents’?**  
  Yes. All players’ sundivers may launch from any mothership if Portal is active.  
- **Can I hurl a station?**  
  Only if **Juggernaut** is in play — and you fly it into the heart. It is vaporized.  
- **Can I keep a solar flare?**  
  Yes. You may keep and use it like any instability card.
