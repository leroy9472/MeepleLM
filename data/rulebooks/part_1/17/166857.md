## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Each player leads an ancient civilization striving to achieve greatness through expansion, knowledge, and military strength. The goal is to be the first to earn a set number of Ancient Personages (victory points), earned by meeting cultural, military, and economic milestones. The required number of Personages to win depends on player count.

### 2. Components  
- Double-sided game board (Mare Nostrum / Orient)  
- 212 wooden pieces:  
  - 78 galleys (13 per player)  
  - 72 legions (12 per player)  
  - 36 small markers (6 per player)  
  - 6 octagonal player markers  
- 144 city tokens (24 per player: 8 gold, 8 marble, 8 iron)  
- 20 temples  
- 53 cards:  
  - 37 setup location cards (Grey/Yellow sides)  
  - 14 nation cards  
  - 1 Bellona card (English/German)  
- Resource chips: unlimited supply of marble, iron, gold; limited coins  
- Victory point (VP) track with laurel wreath markers indicating win threshold by player count  

### 3. Setup  
- Choose map side (Mare Nostrum or Orient). Use Grey-side cards for Londinuim maps, Yellow-side for Basilia.  
- Randomly assign starting nation cards based on player count and place starting cities.  
- Place 3 neutral temples as indicated for the map and player count.  
- Each player receives:  
  - 3 starting cities (one of each resource type)  
  - 3 marble, 3 iron, 3 gold (no coins initially)  
  - Color-matched legions, galleys, temples, city tokens  
- Place each player’s rondel marker in the center and VP marker at 0.  
- Randomly select a start player. The player to their right receives the Bellona card.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn proceeds in **three strict phases**:  
1. **Action Selection** (Rondel Action)  
2. **Founding Cities**  
3. **Winning Personages**  

Play proceeds clockwise.

#### 1. Action Selection  
On the first turn, choose any rondel space. On subsequent turns:  
- Move up to 3 spaces **clockwise** for free.  
- Pay **1 resource (marble, iron, gold, or coin)** per additional space beyond 3, up to a maximum of **4 extra spaces** (7 total movement).  
- Cannot stay on the same action two turns in a row.  

Actions (clockwise on rondel):  
- **Marmor (Marble)**: Produce 1 marble per marble city (3 if city has temple). Receive 1 coin.  
- **Ferrum (Iron)**: Produce 1 iron per iron city (3 if city has temple). Receive 1 coin.  
- **Aurum (Gold)**: Produce 1 gold per gold city (3 if city has temple). Receive 1 coin.  
- **Templum (Temple)**: Build one or more temples at owned cities. Cost: 5 marble per temple. Max 1 temple per city.  
- **Militia (Arming)**: Add legions (land) or galleys (sea) at your cities. Cost: 2 iron per unit.  
  - Max 1 new unit per city without temple.  
  - Max 3 new units per city with temple.  
  - Friendly or enemy units present do not affect limit.  
  - **Bellona card**: Gain 1 free unit when taking this action; then pass card clockwise.  
- **Scientia (Know-How)**: Develop one or more technologies.  
  - First player to develop a tech pays higher cost and earns a Scholar (9 VP).  
  - Vertical techs must be researched in order:  
    - Mercatura → Commercium  
    - Metallum → Moneta  
    - Regnum → Res Publica  
  - Strata and Navigatio have no prerequisites.  
- **Movere (Maneuver)**: Conduct in two phases:  
  1. **Movement & Battles**  
     - Move all military units 1 region (or 2 if Strata/Navigation is owned).  
     - Red borders: legions only. Blue borders: galleys only. Mixed: either.  
     - If a unit enters a region with enemy units of the same type, a battle may be initiated by either player.  
     - Units destroy each other 1:1 (back to supply).  
     - Active player chooses order of movement and battle resolution.  
     - Non-moving units may still fight if enemy units are present.  
  2. **Conquest**  
     - After all movement and battles, may attempt to conquer an enemy city if:  
       **Invading units ≥ city’s defense strength**  
     - City defense =  
       - Base: 1 (no temple), 3 (with temple)  
       - +1 per defending land/sea unit in region  
       - +1 if defender has ≤2 Personages  
       - +1 if defender has Regnum, +2 if Res Publica  
     - Neutral temples: defense = 3  
     - Conqueror removes number of units equal to city’s defense.  
     - Remove all defender’s units, city, and temple (if present).  
     - Temple destruction awards General (7 VP) to conqueror.  
     - Replace city token with conqueror’s (same resource type).  
     - **Cannot conquer a player’s last city.**  

#### 2. Founding Cities  
- May found one or more cities in any region where:  
  - You have **at least one military unit** (own or foreign units irrelevant).  
  - There is a **city symbol** on the board.  
  - **No city already exists** in that region.  
- Cost: 1 marble, 1 iron, 1 gold (coins may substitute 1:1).  
- If a **neutral temple** is present:  
  - Must destroy it first (costs 3 units).  
  - At least 1 unit must remain to pay founding cost.  
- On Orient map or multi-resource cities: choose resource type freely.  

#### 3. Winning Personages (VPs)  
At end of turn, check achievements. Award **only if requirements are met and VP cards are available**.  
Once earned, VPs cannot be lost.  
Types:  
- **Kings (10 VP)**: For every 5 cities owned (awarded at 5, 10, 15, etc.)  
- **Generals (7 VP)**: For each temple destroyed (including neutral) during conquest  
- **Citizens (6 VP)**: For every 3 temples owned (awarded at 3, 6, 9, etc.)  
- **Scholars (9 VP)**: For each tech developed **before any other player**  
- **Navigators (5 VP)**: For every 7 sea regions controlled (with galleys) at once  
  - Sea regions with ship symbol count as 2  
  - Counted after all movement and battles  

**Special Rule**: If a player is **1 VP short of winning**, they may win immediately by **destroying a temple**, even if no General cards remain.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Resources**:  
  - Marble, iron, gold: unlimited supply  
  - Coins: limited; act as wild resources (1:1)  
  - Gain 1 coin whenever producing resources (regardless of amount)  
- **Rondel Movement**:  
  - 8-space wheel; movement cost increases beyond 3 spaces  
- **Tech Tree**:  
  - Mercatura → Commercium  
  - Metallum → Moneta  
  - Regnum → Res Publica  
  - Strata, Navigatio: independent  
- **Know-How Effects**:  
  - **Mercatura**: Trade 2 resources → 1 (any type, not coins)  
  - **Commercium**: Trade 3 → 2  
  - **Metallum**: +1 resource when producing  
  - **Moneta**: +2 resources when producing (does not stack with Metallum)  
  - **Regnum**: +1 city defense  
  - **Res Publica**: +2 city defense (does not stack with Regnum)  
  - **Strata**: Legions move 2 land regions  
  - **Navigatio**: Galleys move 2 sea regions  
- **Defense Bonus**: Cities gain +1 defense if owner has 0, 1, or 2 Personages  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition**: First player to reach required Personages:  
  - 6 players: 7  
  - 5 players: 8  
  - 4 players: 9  
  - 3 players: 10  
- VPs awarded **at end of turn**  
- Cannot earn duplicate Personages (e.g., cannot earn King again at 5 cities if already earned)  
- Game ends **immediately** when win condition is met  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use Mercatura/Commercium on the turn I research it?**  
  No. Know-Hows take effect at end of turn.  
- **Can I move-battle-move with Strata/Navigation?**  
  Yes. You may move, battle, then move again if ability allows.  
- **Does city production stop if enemy units are present?**  
  No. Cities function normally regardless of enemy units.  
- **Can I attack a region with only sea units using land units?**  
  No. Conquest requires matching unit types (legions vs land, galleys vs sea).  
- **Can I use coin to pay for temple (5 marble)?**  
  Yes. 1 coin = 1 marble.  
- **Do I need to leave a unit behind after founding a city?**  
  No. Founding only requires presence at start of phase.  
- **Can I use Bellona if I can’t place the free unit?**  
  No. You must have a valid city to place it.
