## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
The rug market in Marrakesh Square is bustling with activity as merchants compete to become the most successful trader. Each player represents a merchant aiming to maximize their total score by combining the number of visible rug halves and their accumulated wealth in dirhams. The player with the highest combined score wins.

2. **Components**  
- 1 Rug Market square (game board)  
- 60 cloth rugs (4 sets of 15 rugs in different colors)  
- 21 coins of 1 dirham  
- 21 coins of 5 dirhams  
- 1 wooden figure: Assam (market organizer)  
- 1 wooden die (showing numbers via slipper symbols)

3. **Setup**  
- Place Assam in the center of the board.  
- Each player receives:  
  - 30 dirhams (5 coins of 1 dirham + 5 coins of 5 dirhams)  
  - For 3 players: 15 rugs of one color each  
  - For 4 players: 12 rugs of one color each  
- For 2 players: Each player receives 24 rugs (12 of two different colors, shuffled into one face-down draw pile) and 30 dirhams  
- The last player who stepped on a rug (or randomly chosen) goes first.  
- Play proceeds clockwise.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
On a player’s turn, perform the following actions in order:  
1. **Move Assam**  
   - Choose a direction for Assam to face: keep current direction, turn 90° left, or 90° right. No 180° turns allowed.  
   - Roll the die. The number (1–6) determines how many squares Assam moves in a straight line in the selected direction.  
   - If Assam reaches the edge of the board, he turns around at the mosaic/arrows (this turn does not count as a space moved).  
2. **Pay Other Merchants if Required**  
   - If Assam ends his movement on an opponent’s rug, the current player pays that opponent an amount equal to the size (in connected squares) of the rug group Assam landed on.  
     - Only orthogonally adjacent rug squares of the same color are counted (no diagonals).  
     - The square Assam is on counts toward the total.  
   - No payment is due if Assam is on an empty square or the current player’s own rug.  
   - If a player cannot pay fully, they pay what they can and are eliminated.  
     - Remaining unplayed rugs are removed from the game.  
     - Already placed rugs remain and become neutral (no future payments when landed on).  
3. **Lay One Rug**  
   - Place one of your rugs adjacent to the square where Assam stopped.  
   - One edge of the rug must align with one of the four sides of Assam’s current square.  
   - A rug covers two adjacent squares and may be placed on:  
     - Two empty squares  
     - One empty square and one half-covered square (any color)  
     - Two half-covered squares of different colors  
   - A single rug cannot fully cover an opponent’s complete rug (i.e., cannot completely overlay one existing full rug in one move).  
     - However, two separate rugs can each cover half of an opponent’s rug, fully obscuring it over time.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Assam Movement**: Direction choice precedes die roll. Movement is straight-line only. Edge mosaics trigger automatic U-turn without cost.  
- **Payment Mechanism**: Triggered only when Assam lands on an opponent’s rug. Payment = size of contiguous same-color rug group (including landing square).  
- **Rug Placement**: Must be orthogonally adjacent to Assam’s final position. Enables strategic blocking, coverage, and area control.  
- **Rug Coverage Rules**: Full coverage of an opponent’s rug must occur in two separate moves. Partial coverage is allowed freely.  
- **Player Elimination**: Occurs upon inability to pay. Player exits but their rugs stay as neutral (non-scoring, no payment zones).

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- The game ends immediately after the last rug is placed.  
- Final scoring:  
  - Each visible **half-rug** = 1 point  
  - Each **dirham** = 1 point  
- Total score = visible rug halves + dirhams  
- Tiebreaker: Player with more dirhams wins. If still tied, shared victory (not specified further).

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can Assam end on a half-covered square?**  
  Yes. Payment is based only on whether the square contains a full rug of an opponent’s color. Half-rugs do not trigger payment.  
- **What counts as “connected” rugs?**  
  Only rugs of the same color sharing a full edge (orthogonal). Diagonals do not connect.  
- **Can I place a rug that covers two halves of the same opponent’s rug?**  
  Yes, as long as they are not part of the same full rug being fully covered in one move.  
- **Do neutral rugs ever trigger payments?**  
  No. Once a player is eliminated, their rugs become neutral and do not generate income.  
- **Can I rotate Assam 90° onto a direction that leads off the board?**  
  Yes. Movement still follows the U-turn rule at the edge.  
- **Variant Rule Summary (Optional Play)**  
  - Turn order changes to:  
    1. Roll die  
    2. Move Assam (in current facing)  
    3. Pay if needed  
    4. Lay rug  
    5. Rotate Assam 90° (left or right)  
  - This rotation dictates the direction the *next* player must move Assam in.
