## Quoridor4Fun – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Quoridor4Fun is a modified two-player version of the classic abstract strategy game Quoridor, incorporating a d4 die to introduce variability in movement and fence placement. While the original game emphasizes pure strategy, this variant adds an element of chance while preserving strategic depth through conditional turn mechanics.  

**Objective**: Be the first player to move your pawn to the opposite edge of the 9×9 board (your opponent’s starting row).

All standard Quoridor rules apply unless modified below.

### 2. Components  
- 1 standard Quoridor board (9×9 grid)  
- 2 pawns (one per player)  
- 20 fences per player (total 40)  
- 1 shared d4 die  

*Note: The game is designed for exactly 2 players only.*

---

### 3. Setup  
- Each player places their pawn in the center square of their respective baseline (Player 1: row 1, column E; Player 2: row 9, column E).  
- Each player starts with 10 fences in reserve.  
- Players decide who goes first (e.g., roll the d4; highest roll starts).  
- The d4 die is placed near the board for shared use.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in alternating order. On your turn:

1. **Roll the d4 die** to get a number (1–4).  
2. **Choose one action type**:  
   - Move your pawn exactly **X squares**, or  
   - Place exactly **X fences** on the board.  
3. **Execute the chosen action completely**:  
   - If moving: Move your pawn exactly X squares, changing direction during movement as allowed by standard Quoridor movement rules (including valid pawn jumps and wall interactions).  
   - If placing fences: Place exactly X fences anywhere legal on the board (each fence must be placed in a valid position, not overlapping others or blocking all paths).  
4. **Special Rule for Rolling a 4**:  
   - If you roll a 4 and use it (for movement or fencing), you **must skip your next turn**.  
   - However, if your opponent *also* rolls a 4 and skips their next turn, the turn order resets normally after both skips are processed.

5. **Mandatory Action Execution**:  
   - You must be able to fully perform the action you choose.  
     - Example: If you roll a 3 but only have 2 fences left, you **cannot** choose to place 3 fences — you **must move 3 squares**.  
     - Similarly, if you roll a 2 but cannot legally move 2 squares (due to walls), you **must place 2 fences**, provided you have them.  
     - If you cannot legally perform *either* action (extremely rare), consult edge cases below.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Movement  
- You may change direction during your multi-square move.  
- Standard Quoridor movement rules apply:  
  - Pawns move one square orthogonally (not diagonally).  
  - Adjacent pawn blocking allows jumping over (if wall behind opponent).  
  - Cannot move through or jump over walls.  
- You must move **exactly X squares** as rolled, using valid moves only.

#### Fence Placement  
- You may place X fences (as rolled) in any legal positions on the board.  
- Fences must:  
  - Be placed between two sets of grid points (horizontally or vertically).  
  - Not overlap existing fences.  
  - Not completely block all paths to either player’s goal.  
- Fences do **not** need to be placed consecutively or adjacent to each other.  
- You may split placements across turns — but **not within a single turn** (you place all X at once).

#### Turn Skipping (Rolling a 4)  
- Rolling and using a 4 triggers a **mandatory skip of your next turn**.  
- Turn order proceeds as follows:  
  - You roll 4 → perform action → your next turn is skipped.  
  - Opponent takes their turn.  
  - If opponent does **not** roll a 4, they play normally, and your turn is skipped.  
  - If opponent **does** roll a 4, they perform their action, and **their** next turn is also skipped.  
  - After both players have completed their current turns, the next in line skips.  
  - Example sequence:  
    1. Player A rolls 4 → moves/places → must skip next turn.  
    2. Player B rolls 4 → moves/places → must skip next turn.  
    3. Player A skips.  
    4. Player B skips.  
    5. Player A rolls again — normal turn resumes.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is **no scoring system**.  
- The game ends immediately when one player moves their pawn onto any square of the opponent’s baseline (row 9 for Player 1, row 1 for Player 2).  
- That player **wins**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I move fewer than X squares or place fewer than X fences?**  
A: No. You must perform the **exact** number rolled.

**Q: Can I split the roll (e.g., move 2 and place 1 after rolling 3)?**  
A: No. Choose **one action type only**: either move X squares or place X fences.

**Q: What if I roll a 3 but only have 2 fences? Can I place 2 and move 1?**  
A: No. Since you cannot place 3 fences, you **must move 3 squares**.

**Q: What if I roll a 4 but only have 3 fences?**  
A: You **cannot** place 4 fences, so you **must move 4 squares**.

**Q: What if I roll a 4 and cannot move 4 squares?**  
A: If you have 4 or more fences, you **must place 4 fences**.  
If you have fewer than 4 fences **and** cannot move 4 squares, this is a rare stalemate condition. In practice, at least one option should always be available due to board size and early-game mobility.

**Q: Why is this only for 2 players?**  
A: With 3 or 4 players, the turn-skipping mechanic creates chaotic and unbalanced sequences. The d4 variance and forced skips break game fairness and pacing.

**Q: Why a d4 and not a d6?**  
A: Higher numbers (5–6) would allow excessive movement or fencing per turn, making control impossible. The d4’s limited range (1–4), combined with the penalty for rolling 4, balances chance and strategy.

**Q: Is this game "fair" if someone rolls a 4 early and opponent moves 6 squares?**  
A: It introduces risk, but skilled players mitigate this by:  
- Avoiding forward-only movement after rolling 4.  
- Using early 4-rolls to build strong wall formations.  
- Anticipating opponent’s double turns and blocking paths proactively.
