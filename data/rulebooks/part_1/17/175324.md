### 1. Lore & Objective
Fog of Love is a romantic comedy board game for two players. Each player creates a fictional character and guides them through a relationship, making choices that affect both personal satisfaction and the health of the relationship. The story unfolds across multiple chapters, including sweet moments, serious events, and dramatic turns.

The objective is to fulfill your character’s final DESTINY, chosen at the end of the game. A DESTINY may require high Satisfaction, specific Personality balances, or relationship outcomes (e.g., staying together or breaking up). Success depends not only on your choices but also on your partner’s actions and decisions.

The game ends with THE FINALE, where players reveal their final DESTINY and determine whether it has been fulfilled. Both characters can succeed, or one or both may end up unsatisfied—mirroring the unpredictable nature of real relationships.

3. Place the SYNOPSIS card face-up on the SYNOPSIS spot on the board. Note any special rules.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players alternate turns in the following sequence:
1. **Optional:** Discard any number of MINOR SCENES to draw new SCENES (from decks allowed by current CHAPTER).  
2. **Play a Scene:** Play one SCENE from hand. Resolve it fully (except SECRETS, which remain hidden).  
3. **Draw:** Draw SCENES to restore hand to 5 cards.  
4. **Check Chapter End:** If the number of SCENES played equals the CHAPTER LENGTH, end the chapter.

After the current player finishes their turn post-threshold, reveal the next CHAPTER card. Remove all cards from the PLAY AREA and place them in the discard pile (face-up, next to SWEET deck).

Game ends when THE FINALE is revealed.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Satisfaction (●)
- Tracked on character card using a colored token.  
- Starts at 0. Increases or decreases via card effects.  
- Cannot go below 0.  
- At 10+, use ×5 tokens to track excess.

#### Personality Dimensions & Tokens
- Six dimensions: Discipline, Curiosity, Extroversion, Gentleness, Sincerity, Sensitivity.  
- Each has two ASPECTS (up/down arrow).  
- PERSONALITY TAXENS (wooden tokens) are placed on the board to record choices.  
- Balance = difference between up and down tokens in a dimension.

#### Traits & Trait Goals
- Each player selects 3 TRAITS from 5 dealt.  
- TRAITS have TRAIT GOALS based on Personality balance:  
  - **Individual Goal:** Balance in one ASPECT in your own tokens.  
  - **Shared Goal:** Combined balance of both players.  
- If multiple TRAITS use the same ASPECT, requirements are multiplied (2nd = ×2, 3rd = ×3).

#### Destinies
- Each player starts with all 7 DESTINIES in their color.  
- DESTINIES are kept secret.  
- Some card effects cause players to discard, swap, or retrieve DESTINIES.  
- Minimum of 2 DESTINIES must remain in hand.  
- At THE FINALE, choose one final DESTINY to attempt to fulfill.

#### Scene Types
- **BOTH CHOOSE:** Both players secretly choose A/B/C/D using CHOICE TOKENS. Resolve effects and additional effects based on match/mismatch.  
- **PARTNER CHOOSES:** Non-player makes the choice and gains associated tokens/effects.  
- **SITUATION:** Played face-up; affects next SCENE. Icon: ↻  
- **SECRET:** Played face-down under board. Remains hidden until revealed or game end.  
- **MINOR SCENE:** Does not count toward CHAPTER LENGTH. Can be discarded at start of turn to draw new cards.  
- **REACTION:** Played out of turn in response to another SCENE. Immediately draw a replacement.  
- **SPECIAL EFFECT:** Unique mechanics as described.

#### Decks & Chapter Rules
- Current CHAPTER card dictates which deck(s) you may draw from.  
- SCENES may be played from any deck regardless of current draw restrictions.

#### Gender
- Choose gender by flipping character card.  
- Rarely affects gameplay; only relevant for specific SCENES (e.g., pregnancy).  
- Can be customized (e.g., use adoption instead of pregnancy).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
At THE FINALE:
1. Choose your final DESTINY from hand.  
2. Reveal and resolve all unrevealed SECRETS (resolve “if not revealed” effects).  
3. Score Satisfaction from:  
   - TRAIT GOALS fulfilled (each grants ●)  
   - DESTINY conditions (e.g., partner’s Satisfaction, Personality balance)  
4. Check if final DESTINY is fulfilled.

Example: UNCONDITIONAL LOVE requires:
- Individual balance of ↑Sincerity  
- Partner’s Satisfaction ≥ 40  
- Partner does not break up

Game ends with narrative reflection on the relationship.
