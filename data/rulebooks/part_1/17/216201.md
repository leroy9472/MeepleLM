# Robo Rally 2016 Damage Cards and Mini-FAQ — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players control robots in a dangerous factory race, programming movements to reach flags in order while surviving board hazards and robot interactions. The first robot to touch all flags in sequence wins.

2. Components  
- Robot figures, player mats, Archive markers  
- Programming decks (six 20-card decks)  
- Damage cards: SPAM, WORM, TROJAN HORSE, VIRUS  
- Upgrade cards  
- Energy cubes, checkpoint tokens, reboot tokens  
- Game boards, priority antenna  
- 30-second sand timer  

3. Setup  
- Choose a course and set up boards, flags, priority antenna, reboot tokens, and energy cubes as specified.  
- Each player selects a robot, takes matching figure, player mat, and programming deck.  
- Shuffle programming deck and place face down on player mat.  
- Place four damage card piles (SPAM, WORM, VIRUS, TROJAN HORSE) face up near the board.  
- Shuffle upgrade deck, draw face-up cards equal to number of players to form upgrade shop.  
- Each player takes 5 energy cubes.  
- Place robots on start board gears, facing the course. Youngest player places first.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:  
1. Upgrade Phase – Purchase upgrades based on priority.  
2. Programming Phase – Simultaneously draw 9 cards, select 5 to program into registers.  
3. Activation Phase – Execute registers 1–5 in order, each involving:  
   - Reveal register cards  
   - Activate robots by priority  
   - Activate board elements and lasers  
   - Resolve checkpoints and energy collection  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Priority: Determined by proximity to priority antenna. Ties broken clockwise from antenna’s line.  
- Programming: Draw 9 cards, program 5 into registers. Unused cards discarded.  
- Damage Cards:  
  - SPAM: Discard to SPAM pile. Play top card of deck this register.  
  - TROJAN HORSE: Take 2 SPAM, discard to TROJAN HORSE pile. Play top deck card.  
  - VIRUS: All robots within 6 spaces take 1 SPAM. Discard to VIRUS pile. Play top deck card.  
  - WORM: Discard to WORM pile. Immediately reboot robot.  
- Rebooting: Triggered by pits, falling off board, or WORM card. Robot:  
  - Takes 2 SPAM damage cards  
  - Cancels current programming  
  - Respawns on reboot token (or start space), facing any direction  
- Upgrades:  
  - Permanent (yellow): Last entire game  
  - Temporary (red): Single use, discarded after activation  
  - Purchase during Upgrade Phase using energy cubes, based on priority  
- Board Elements (activate at end of each register):  
  - Conveyor Belts: Move robots 1 or 2 spaces  
  - Rotating Belts: Rotate robot 90° when moved onto by belt  
  - Push Panels: Activate on specific registers (2/4 or 1/3/5)  
  - Gears: Rotate robot 90°  
  - Lasers: Board and robot lasers deal SPAM damage  
  - Pits: Cause immediate reboot  
  - Energy Spaces: Collect cube if ending on space; 5th register allows draw from bank  
- Robot Interactions:  
  - Pushing: Robot entering occupied space pushes target in movement direction  
  - Cannot push through walls  
  - Robot Lasers: Fire in facing direction; deal 1 SPAM unless modified by upgrades  
- Again & Repeat Routine: If previous register was damage card, draw and play top deck card  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Goal: Reach all checkpoints in numerical order.  
- A robot completes a checkpoint by ending any register on it.  
- First robot to complete final checkpoint wins immediately.
