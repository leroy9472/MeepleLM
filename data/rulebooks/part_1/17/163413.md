## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Murano is set in the Venetian lagoon, where players take on the role of merchants competing to become the most prestigious businessman through glass production, trade, and strategic development across islands. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by building structures, recruiting characters, and fulfilling end-game conditions via Character Cards.

2. Components  
- 1 Game Board (two sides: 2–3 player and 4-player)  
- 8 Ships (1 red, 7 black)  
- 40 Character Cards  
- 12 Glass Factory Tiles (green)  
- 30 Glass Beads (10 each red, green, blue) in a cloth bag  
- 12 Shop Tiles (white)  
- 32 Gondoliers (8 each in white, brown, orange, grey)  
- 1 Bag (for glass beads)  
- 47 Coins (26 × 1 Gold, 21 × 5 Gold)  
- 12 Palace Tiles (yellow)  
- 60 Markers (15 per player color; for Shops and Glass Factories)  
- 4 "50+" VP Tokens  
- 42 Street Tiles (grey; some with customers, some blank)  
- 12 Special Building Tiles (red)  
- 15 Special Building Cards  

3. Setup  
- Use the 2–3 player side of the board if playing with fewer than 4 players; otherwise use the 4-player side.  
- Place one Ship (facing counter-clockwise) on each Action Space marked with an anchor. Placement of the Red Ship is arbitrary.  
- Each player takes:  
  - 8 Gondoliers of their color  
  - All 15 Markers of their color  
  - 5 Gold  
- Place 1 Gondolier on space "5" of the VP Track; place 2 Gondoliers in the general supply on the board.  
- Return remaining 5 Gondoliers to player supply.  

For 2–3 players only:  
- Remove:  
  - 2 Character Cards related to "Sacca Serenella"  
  - 1 Shop tile of each color (3 total)  
  - 1 random Palace  
  - 3 Special Building tiles  
  - 1 Glass Factory tile  
  - 3 Street Tiles with one customer (1 of each color)  
  - 4 blank Street Tiles  

Tile and card preparation:  
- Shuffle Shop, Palace, and Street tile stacks; split Street Tiles into two face-down stacks on "S. Giacomo e S. Maffio".  
- Do not shuffle Glass Factory or Special Building tiles (all identical).  
- Shuffle Character Cards and Special Building Cards separately.  
- Remove 5 Character Cards at random (unseen) and return to box.  
- Place decks face down near the board.  
- Place remaining Gold and glass beads (in bag) near the board.  
- Randomly determine the starting player.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On a turn, a player must either:  
A. Take an action, or  
B. Pass  

**Taking an Action:**  
0. (Optional) Move 1 ship and take 1 Gold instead of an action.  
1. Move one or more Ships counter-clockwise to reach a desired Action Space.  
   - Ships cannot pass or land on occupied spaces unless using Lighthouse ability.  
   - First Ship moved costs 0 Gold.  
   - Each subsequent Ship moved costs 1 more Gold than the previous: 0, 1, 2, 3…  
   - Total cost = sum of individual movement costs.  
   - All movement payments must be made before executing the action.  
2. Execute the action of the space reached by the **last** Ship moved.  

**Passing:**  
- Move exactly one Ship (following movement rules).  
- Gain 1 Gold from supply.  
- No action is performed.

5. Core Mechanics  
**Actions (by Action Space):**  
a. **Take 2 Gold** – Gain 2 Gold from supply.  
b. **Buy Building:**  
   - Glass Factory (green): Pay 1 Gold; take 1 tile (face-down in front of you).  
   - Special Building (red): Pay 2 Gold; take top tile (face-down).  
   - Shop or Palace (white/yellow):  
     - Pay 2 Gold: take top tile.  
     - Pay 4 Gold: search stack, choose any tile, then shuffle stack.  
c. **Recruit a Character:**  
   - Draw 3 Character Cards.  
   - Cost = 1 + number of Character Cards already owned.  
   - Buy up to 1 card; return others to bottom of deck.  
   - Optional purchase; if none bought, turn ends (no Gold gained).  
d. **Place a Gondolier:**  
   - Pay 2 Gold: place on own-color gondola.  
   - Pay 5 Gold: place on any opponent’s gondola.  
   - Once placed, Gondoliers remain until game end.  
e. **Build:**  
   - May place 1–3 tiles (Street, Glass Factory, Shop, Palace, Special Building).  
   - Street Tiles:  
     - Free; drawn from stack and placed on any paved space.  
     - May view tile before placement.  
     - No VP awarded.  
   - Buildings (must be owned):  
     - Must be placed orthogonally adjacent to a Street Tile.  
     - Score VP:  
       - Glass Factory: 1 VP + place Marker  
       - Shop: 2 VP + place Marker  
       - Palace: 3 VP  
       - Special Building: draw 3 Special Building Cards, choose 1 (face-up), return others to bottom. Gain permanent effect.  
f. **Income:**  
   - Choose one Island.  
   - Choose up to 1 Shop per color that you own on that Island.  
   - Gain 1 Gold per customer on that Island matching the color of selected Shops.  
   - Customers can be anywhere on the Island; no adjacency requirement.  
g. **Production:**  
   - Declare number of Glass Factories to use (any number, including zero).  
   - Lose 2 VP per Glass Factory used (cannot go below 0 VP).  
   - Draw 1 glass bead per producing Glass Factory from the bag.  
   - Optionally sell 1–3 glass beads of the **same color**:  
     - 1 bead: 5 Gold  
     - 2 beads: 12 Gold  
     - 3 beads: 20 Gold  
   - Return sold beads to bag; keep unsold beads.  
   - May use action to sell beads only (no production required).  
h. **Hire/Fire Gondoliers:**  
   - Hire: Pay 3 Gold; take 1 Gondolier from general supply (max 7 in personal supply).  
   - Fire: Return 1 Gondolier to general supply; gain 3 Gold.  
   - Only 1 per action.

- **Trading Station**: Draw +1 bead during production; return 1 bead to bag at end of turn.  
- **Studio**: Change glass bead colors when selling or scoring.

- **Construction Crane**: Gain 1 VP when building specific Building type.  
- **Basilica**: Gain 5 VP immediately upon building.

6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger:**  
- Game ends when **two different stacks** of tiles are empty (e.g., Shops and Palaces).  
- Streets count as one stack (even though split into two piles).  
- The player who empties the second stack finishes their turn (final turn).  
- All other players get one final turn (clockwise order).  

**Special Rule on Final Turn:**  
- If a player buys a Building (Shop, Palace, Glass Factory, Special Building) during their final turn, they may **immediately place it on the board** (if legal: adjacent to Street Tile).  
- Score VP as normal.  
- No additional cost.  

**Scoring Phase (after final turns):**  
1. Players score in clockwise order starting with the player who triggered the end.  
2. Reveal Character Cards one at a time.  
3. For each card:  
   - Choose an Island to score it on.  
   - Move one of your Gondoliers from a gondola on that Island onto the Island (used for scoring).  
   - Score VP as described on the card.  
4. A Gondolier can only score **one** Character Card.  
5. After all possible cards are scored:  
   - Gain 1 VP for each Gondolier **on the board** (i.e., not in general supply) that was not used to score a Character Card.  
6. Optional: Convert Gold to VP at end:  
   - Spend 1 Gold → 1 VP  
   - Spend 4 Gold → 3 VP  
   - Spend 9 Gold → 6 VP  
   - Spend 16 Gold → 10 VP  
   - Max 8 Gold can be converted.  

**Winning:**  
- Highest total VP wins.  
- Tiebreaker: Most Gold remaining.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Red Ship Function**: Normally treated like any other Ship. Only the player with the **Lighthouse** may move it onto an occupied space.  
- **Lighthouse Use**: Optional. If used, Red Ship must be the **last** moved. Action of that space must be taken.  
- **Building Rules**:  
  - Street Tiles can be placed anywhere on paved spaces; no adjacency needed.  
  - Buildings must be adjacent to a Street Tile (orthogonal).  
  - When placing multiple tiles in one Build action, place one at a time; may view Street Tiles before placement.  
- **Income Action**:  
  - Customers do **not** need to be adjacent to Shops.  
  - Only one Shop per color counts, even if multiple exist.  
- **Guild Hall Timing**: VP bonus comes **after** losing VP for production; cannot use bonus to offset loss.  
- **Character Card Requirements**:  
  - Cards requiring a specific Island must be scored there.  
  - Cards requiring 2 Gondoliers: must have 2 present; only 1 is consumed.  
  - "Same number of Buildings as opponents combined": must have at least one Glass Factory or Shop on the Island.  
- **Scoring Misprint Clarified**: Only Gondoliers **on the board** (not in supply) earn 1 VP each if unused.
