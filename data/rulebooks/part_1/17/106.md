## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper*, players assume the roles of Victorian-era investigators attempting to solve the infamous Whitechapel murders. The objective is to score the most Victory Points (VPs) by strategically playing evidence, suspects, and gavel cards to influence which suspect is revealed as Jack the Ripper — or to trigger the Ripper’s escape. The game ends when any player reaches or exceeds 100 points; the highest score wins.

### 2. Components  
The game contains 62 cards divided into two categories:

**Gavel Cards (25 total):**  
- **Victims (5):** Mary Nichols, Annie Chapman, "Long Liz" Stride, Kate Eddowes, Mary Jane Kelly  
- **Scenes (5):** Buck's Row, Hanbury Street, Berner Street, Mitre Square, 13 Miller's Court  
- **Suspects (6):** Montague Druitt (#1), Prince Eddy (#2), Sir Gull (#3), Dr. Pedachenko (#4), George Chapman (#5), Jill The Ripper (#6)  
- **Alibis (5):** One for each suspect (Prince Eddy/Sir Gull is a dual-use card)  
- **Special Gavel Cards (4):**  
  - 2 × Commissioner Resigns  
  - 2 × Ripper Strikes  
- **1 × Ripper Escapes** (unique card; not a Gavel or Evidence card)

**Evidence Cards (36 total):**  
- 5 each of Montague Druitt, Prince Eddy, Sir Gull, Dr. Pedachenko, George Chapman, Jill The Ripper  
- 5 × Scenes (matching Scene cards)  
- 4 × Letters (do not count toward any suspect)  
- 2 × Wild Cards (can substitute for any suspect’s Evidence card except Letters)

### 3. Setup  
- Shuffle all cards.  
- Deal cards face down:  
  - 2 players: 10 cards each  
  - 3 players: 9 cards each  
  - 4 players: 8 cards each  
- Flip the top card of the remaining deck to start the discard pile ("Scotland Yard").  
- The rest form the draw pile ("Case File").  
- Give each player a score sheet if available.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each player takes a turn in clockwise order, following this sequence:

#### ① Call Vote (Optional, Once Per Hand)  
- Only a player with at least one meld (3+ matching Evidence cards) in play may call a vote.  
- All players secretly write down which suspect they believe will be the Ripper.  
- Letters and Ripper Escapes cannot be voted for.  
- Only one vote may be called per hand.

#### ② Draw (Mandatory)  
- Draw one card:  
  - From the top of the draw pile (Case File), **or**  
  - From the top of the discard pile (Scotland Yard).  
- When the draw pile is exhausted the first time, reshuffle the discard pile (except top card) to form a new draw pile.  
- If the draw pile is exhausted a second time, the hand ends immediately (Ripper Escapes scoring applies).

#### ③ Play Cards From Hand (Optional)  
- **Gavel Cards:** May play **only one per turn**, unless a Scene card allows playing a second.  
- **Evidence Cards:** May play any number, subject to rules below.

##### Conditions for Playing Cards:
- **Victim, Scene, Ripper Strikes, Commissioner Resigns:** May be played at any time, even if no cards are in play.  
- **Evidence Melds (3+ cards):** May only be played if **at least one Victim card** is in play.  
- **Individual Evidence Cards (layoffs):** May be played if a meld of that color is already in play (by any player).  
- **Suspect Cards:** May only be played if a matching Evidence meld is in play.  
- **Alibi Cards:** May only be played if a matching Evidence meld is in play.  
  - Only **one Alibi** may be in play at a time. Discard any existing Alibi when a new one is played.  
  - For Prince Eddy/Sir Gull Alibi: player must declare which suspect it applies to.  
- **Scene Cards:** When played:  
  - Take the matching Victim card (if in play) and move it to your area.  
  - Choose any card (except another Scene) from the discard pile. Reveal it.  
    - If it is a Gavel card: must play it immediately or take it into hand (cannot play it later this turn).  
    - Otherwise: add to hand.  
- **Ripper Strikes:** Play to discard pile. Reveal cards from draw pile one by one until a Victim appears or 5 cards are revealed. If a Victim is found, play it (draw 2 cards, take matching Scene if in play).  
- **Commissioner Resigns:** Play to discard pile. All players must reveal and play any Victim cards from their hand.  
  - No card draw for Victims played this way.  
  - Matching Scenes are taken normally.  
  - If this causes a player to discard their last card, the hand ends.  
- **Ripper Escapes:**  
  - May only be played when **all five Victim cards** are in play.  
  - May be played **at any time**, even during another player’s turn.  
  - Ends the hand immediately.

#### ④ Discard (Mandatory)  
- Must discard exactly one card face-up to the discard pile.  
- A player **cannot go out** unless they discard their last card.  
- Playing a Gavel card to the discard pile (e.g., Commissioner Resigns) does **not** count as the discard — you must still discard a card.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Melds:** A set of 3 or more matching Evidence cards of the same suspect color. Must be played together to start a suspect line.  
- **Layoffs:** After a meld is in play, players may play single matching Evidence cards (or Wilds) to it.  
- **Wild Cards:** Can be used in any Evidence meld except Letters. Count as that suspect’s card.  
- **Alibi Effect:** A suspect with an Alibi card in play **cannot** be the Ripper.  
- **Tiebreaker:** If two suspects tie for highest card total, the suspect with the lower number (bottom-left corner) is the Ripper.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Hand Ends When:
- A player discards their last card.  
- Ripper Escapes card is played.  
- The draw pile is exhausted for the **second time**.  
- Commissioner Resigns forces a player to discard their last card.

#### Determine Scoring Type:

**The Ripper Is Caught (Normal Scoring):**  
Applies **only if**:  
- The hand ends by a player discarding their last card (or forced by Commissioner Resigns), **and**  
- There is at least one suspect with an active Evidence meld (not canceled by Alibi), and it is not solely Letters.

**The Ripper Escapes (Alternate Scoring):**  
Applies if:  
- Ripper Escapes card is played, **or**  
- Draw pile is exhausted twice, **or**  
- The only possible suspect has an Alibi, **or**  
- Only Letters evidence is in play without a valid suspect.

#### Scoring – Ripper Is Caught:
1. **Determine the Ripper:**  
   - Sum all Evidence and Suspect card values (top-right number) for each suspect.  
   - Exclude suspects with an Alibi in play.  
   - Highest total wins; tie goes to lower suspect number.  
2. **Score Each Player:**  
   - All cards in play: face value.  
   - Cards matching the Ripper’s color: **double** value.  
   - Cards in hand:  
     - Subtract face value of **all** cards **except**:  
       - Evidence, Suspect, or Alibi cards that match an existing meld (may be laid off).  
   - **Ripper Escapes card in hand:** Does **not** deduct 35; instead, deduct **2 points per Victim in play**.  
3. **Vote Bonus:** +10 VPs to each player who correctly voted for the Ripper.

#### Scoring – Ripper Escapes:
- **Player who played Ripper Escapes:** +35 VPs.  
- **All players:** Score face value of **Victim** and **Scene** cards in play.  
- **No points** for other cards.  
- **No deductions** for cards in hand.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a Gavel card and still use Scene to play another?**  
  Yes. If you play a Scene card and retrieve a Gavel card from the discard pile, you may play it immediately — this is the only way to play two Gavel cards in one turn.  
- **Can I vote for a suspect with no card in play?**  
  Yes. Votes are based on prediction, not current presence.  
- **Do Scene or Victim cards in hand count as playable for scoring?**  
  No. Only Evidence, Suspect, and Alibi cards that match existing melds are exempt from hand penalties. Scenes and Victims in hand always count against you unless Ripper Escapes is triggered.  
- **What happens if all five Victims are played due to Commissioner Resigns?**  
  Play pauses. The player holding Ripper Escapes may play it immediately (even out of turn) before the hand ends via discard.  
- **Can I discard a card to end the game even if I could play it?**  
  Yes. Discard is mandatory, and you may choose any card, even if playable.
