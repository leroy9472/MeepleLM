   - 2 players: 11 cities razed

4. **Place Strongholds:**  
   - Starting with the Chairman and proceeding clockwise, each Baron places their Stronghold on the board (not on cities).  
   - In 2- or 3-player games, Strongholds cannot be placed on the outer row or column of the Kingdom map.  

5. **Place Nobles:**  
   - Starting with the last Baron to place a Stronghold, players take turns placing one Noble (with assigned troops) on the board.  
   - Nobles may be placed in Kingdom areas that are empty, friendly, or neutral (not on enemy Nobles or Strongholds).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:

#### 1. Planning Phase  
- Each player selects 6 Action cards from their hand and divides them into 3 piles of 2.  
- Piles are placed into Stacks #1, #2, and #3 in order.  
- Each stack receives 2 neutral Action cards.  
- Each stack is shuffled.  

#### 2. Action Phase  
- The Chairman reveals the top card of Stack #1, then Stack #2, then Stack #3 as they empty.  
- Neutral cards are resolved by the Chairman; player cards by the respective player.  
- Cards are allocated to colored areas (Taxation/Yellow, Wages/Red, Assembly/Blue, Mercenary Draft/Green).  
- **Special Phases trigger when:**  
  - A colored stack has **2 × number of players** cards  
  - Mercenary Draft has **number of players + 1** markers

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Player Actions  
- **Levy Taxes:** Gain 1 Crown per hex containing your Noble(s).  
- **Draft Soldiers:** Place a marker in the Mercenary Draft.  
- **Rally Support:** Gain 2 Votes. If you have the most, become Chairman.  
- **Serve the Church:** Gain 1 Faith. If you have the most, become Head of the Church.  
- **Mobilize Forces:** Move one or more Nobles and/or initiate a battle.  
- **Versatile Strategy:** Choose one:  
  - Gain 2 Crowns  
  - Gain 1 Vote  
  - Move 1 Noble  
  - Start a battle  
  - Buy a marker in the Mercenary Draft  

#### Neutral Actions  
- **Important Event:** Head of Church draws and assigns top Event card (may spend Faith to redirect).  
- **Fund Expeditions:** Chairman starts expedition; players invest; Church may bless (use better of two Fate cards).  
- **Upgrade Defenses:** Remove Breaches (2 Crowns each) or Fortify city (4 Crowns).  
- **Muster Troops:** Remove Casualty tokens (2 Crowns each).  
- **Uncertain Times:** Shuffle Fate deck.  

#### Movement  
- Nobles move:  
  - 1 hex, or  
  - Up to 3 hexes along roads.  
- May move through enemy hexes with permission.  
- Nobles in ports may move to any other port (arrive during Upkeep).  
- Troops may be transferred between unexhausted Nobles in the same hex.  
- Nobles are exhausted after movement or battle.  

#### Battles  

**Open-Field Battles:**  
1. Declare commanders (one per side).  
2. Draw 1 Fate card per 100 troop strength (round down).  
3. Commander allows discarding of at least 2 Fate cards (may keep 1).  
4. Assign casualties (1 per 100 unopposed strength).  
5. Count Victory:  
   - **Stalemate:** Tie → no effect  
   - **Partial Victory (by 1):** Loser retreats, draws deserters  
   - **Full Victory (by 2+):** Loser’s Nobles die, draw deserters  

**Assaults (Cities):**  
- Same as open-field, but defender adds city strength.  
- Defender may assign Breaches instead of Casualties.  
- Attacker wins if:  
  - Full/Partial Victory **and** city strength reduced to 0 **and** defending Nobles dead.  

**Sieges:**  
- Besieger must have greater strength than defender.  
- First "Mobilize Forces" or equivalent places Siege marker.  
- Second such action (on later turn) captures city (defenders die).  
- Defenders may sally out for open-field battle.  

**Advanced Sieges (Optional):**  
- Each turn, besieger draws Fate card (2 if Siege Engine).  
- "Deal 100 Casualties" → place Casualty token on city and Noble (if present).  
- "Prevent 100 Casualties" → place Breach token.  
- City falls when total Casualty + Breach tokens ≥ city strength.  
- Noble inside dies unless "1 Victory" drawn before city falls.  

#### Capturing & Razing Cities  
- Captured city keeps Breaches/Fortifications.  
- Razing grants 3 × city’s income in Crowns; city is destroyed.  

#### Strongholds  
- Attacked like cities.  
- If defeated:  
  - Defender is eliminated (if "Player Elimination" in play).  
  - Victor gains half of defender’s Crowns and one of their cities.  
  - All defender’s Nobles removed; cities become neutral.  

#### Upkeep Phase  
1. **Check for Victory**  
2. **Gain Influence:** 1 per unbesieged city controlled (standard), or per variant (e.g., Worthy Barons, Lords of the Realm)  
3. **Revolt Check:** Cities without Noble: pay 1 Faith or 2 × city income in Crowns, or city revolts (becomes neutral)  
4. **Sea Movement Arrivals:** Nobles who moved by sea arrive  
5. **Refresh Nobles:** Exhausted Nobles become active  
6. **Return Nobles to Board:** Dead Nobles with heirs return (placement rules vary by variant)  

#### Noble Death & Heirs  
- Draw Fate card to determine lost troop nationality.  
- Remove 1 Mercenary per casualty (not Regulars).  
- Noble removed; Heir returns during Upkeep if available.  
- **Limited Heirs (Optional):**  
  - First 2 deaths: Heir returns automatically.  
  - Third+ death: Draw Fate card; if matches Noble’s symbol, Heir returns.  

#### Diplomatic Conquest (Optional)  
- Use "Mobilize Forces" or "Versatile Strategy" to appeal to neutral or enemy city.  
- Spend 1 Faith or 2 × city’s income in Crowns.  
- Draw Fate card:  
  - "1 Victory" → gain control  
  - Else → appeal fails  
- For diplomatically controlled cities:  
  - Revolt check requires **two "Revolt!"** results  
  - Levies cost half  

#### Treachery (Optional)  
- Publicly breaking a deal:  
  - Banned from next Assembly  
  - Return 1 Influence to Pool  
  - +1 Influence per lost City/Noble, +2 per Stronghold/Baron  

#### Capitulation (Optional)  
- Besieged Noble may surrender:  
  - Attacker gains city  
  - No casualties, no deserters  
  - Both sides must honor truce for the turn  

#### Invading Kingdom (Optional)  
- Adds AI-controlled foreign invader.  
- Invader has Stronghold, Nobles, troops.  
- Actions dictated by randomly drawn Action cards.  
- Does not gain Influence, vote, or hold offices.  
- Goal: destruction, not victory.

  - Revolt chance doubles (draw 2 Fate cards, use worst).

  - When Influence Pool empties, highest Influence becomes King.  
  - King gains King’s Army cards.

- **Defector (Optional):**  
  - Spend 5 Crowns or 1 Faith to bribe enemy Noble.
