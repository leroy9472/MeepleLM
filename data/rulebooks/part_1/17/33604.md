## Say Anything — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Say Anything is a social party game centered around opinion-based questions and player creativity. The objective is to guess which answer the current round’s judge (the player with the SELECT-O-MATIC 5000) finds most entertaining or compelling. Players earn points by having their answer chosen, correctly guessing the chosen answer, or both. The game emphasizes humor, expression, and group dynamics over strict competition.

2. Components  
- Question Cards (each containing multiple questions)  
- Dry Erase Pens (1 per player)  
- Answer Boards (1 per player)  
- Player Tokens (2 per player, color-matched to Answer Board)  
- SELECT-O-MATIC 5000 (used by the current judge to secretly select a favorite answer)  
- Score Board  
- Napkins (for erasing Answer Boards)  

3. Setup  
- Each player receives:  
  - 1 Dry Erase Pen  
  - 1 Answer Board  
  - 2 Player Tokens (same color as their board)  
- Choose a Score Keeper. This player receives the Score Board and records scores after each round.  
- The shortest player becomes the first judge and receives the SELECT-O-MATIC 5000 and the Question Cards.  
- Place napkins within reach for erasing answers between rounds.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this sequence:  
1. **Ask a Question**: The player with the SELECT-O-MATIC 5000 draws a Question Card and reads one chosen question aloud.  
2. **Write Answers**: All other players write an answer on their Answer Board and place it face-up on the table.  
3. **Select Favorite Answer**: The judge uses the SELECT-O-MATIC 5000 to secretly choose their favorite answer and places it face-down.  
4. **Guess the Chosen Answer**: All other players place their 2 Player Tokens:  
   - Both tokens on one answer, OR  
   - Split between two different answers.  
   (Players may guess any answer, including their own.)  
5. **Reveal and Score**:  
   - Judge reveals the SELECT-O-MATIC 5000.  
   - Points are awarded based on the chosen answer.  
6. **Prepare for Next Round**:  
   - Players retrieve tokens and erase Answer Boards.  
   - Pass the Question Cards and SELECT-O-MATIC 5000 to the left.  
   - Next player becomes judge.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Answer Writing**: All non-judge players write unique, original answers to the question.  
- **Answer Uniqueness**:  
  - If two players write the same answer, only the first one counts (as determined by the judge).  
  - The second player must write a new answer.  
  - If answers are similar (e.g., “receiving a salary” vs. “earning a paycheck”), the judge decides if they are the same. If so, the second player must rewrite.  
- **Answer Changes**: A player may change their answer only if others are still writing. Once all answers are placed, no changes are allowed.  
- **No Answer Option**: A player who cannot think of an answer may skip writing one but still participates in guessing.  
- **Lobbying**: Non-judge players may persuade the judge to pick their answer. The judge may not influence answers or hint at their choice.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Scoring per Round**:  
  - **Judge**: Earns 1 point for each Player Token on the chosen answer, up to a maximum of 3 points.  
  - **Other Players**: Earn 1 point for each of their tokens placed on the chosen answer.  
  - **Answer Author**: The player who wrote the chosen answer earns 1 bonus point.  
  - **Maximum per Player per Round**: 3 points.  
- **End Game Conditions**:  
  - 3–4 players: Game ends after each player has judged 3 rounds.  
  - 5–6 players: Game ends after each player has judged 2 rounds.  
  - 7–8 players: Game ends after each player has judged 1 round.  
- **Final Scoring**: The Score Keeper totals all players’ points. The highest score wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can the judge influence answers?**  
  No. The judge must remain neutral during answer writing and guessing. They may only share opinions after the chosen answer is revealed.  
- **Can players lobby for their answer?**  
  Yes. Non-judge players may lobby the judge to pick their answer. This is encouraged and part of the fun.  
- **What if two answers are similar?**  
  The judge decides if they are effectively the same. If so, the second writer must create a new answer.  
- **Can I change my answer?**  
  Only if at least one other player has not yet placed their board face-up.  
- **Do I have to write an answer?**  
  No. If you're the last to write and have no idea, you may skip writing. You still guess and may earn points.  
- **Tie-Breaker**:  
  If two or more players tie for highest score:  
  - The last-place player selects a well-known song.  
  - Each tied player sings a line and performs a short dance.  
  - The last-place player picks the best performance, who is declared winner.
