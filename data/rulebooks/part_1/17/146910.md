## Wildcatters — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective
- Players take on the roles of oil pioneers and investors in the 19th century, competing to build empires through drilling, refining, and transporting oil.
- The goal is to supply oil to continents and earn the most victory points (VP) by the end of the game through shares, money, oil delivery, and built refineries.

2. Components
- Game board with 7 continents (5 colored, 2 white)
- 48 area cards (32 light, 16 dark)
- Player pieces per color: 10 drilling rigs, 11 pumpjacks, 8 trains, 4 tankers, 5 refineries, 36 oil barrels
- 60 worker cards (value 1), 20 worker tokens (value 5)
- 480 share cards (60 per player color, value 1), 80 share tokens (20 per player color, value 4)
- 16 Wildcatter disks
- 4 summary cards, 4 refinery chips, 4 victory point markers
- 1 round marker, 4 player sequence chips
- 16 Consolidation chips (4 per color, with VP values: 2, 4, 7, 10)
- Sticker sheet for drilling rigs and Wildcatter disks

3. Setup
- Place board centrally. Set worker and share supplies nearby. Place round marker on Round 1.
- Shuffle light and dark area cards separately. Place dark cards face down, then light cards on top to form draw pile.
- Each player:
  - Takes all pieces of one color.
  - Receives 20 shares of own color, 5 shares of left neighbor’s color, 20 workers.
  - Places VP marker on 10 of track.
  - Randomly determines starting player (receives 1st player chip).
- Each player takes 3 rigs, 2 trains, 1 tanker, 1 refinery.
- Deal 8 light area cards to each player. Players take turns discarding 1 card and placing 1 piece on matching area until all 7 pieces placed.
  - Refineries must be on different colored continents.
  - If area already has refinery, may place in Europe, Africa, or Australia.
- After placement:
  - Shuffle all light cards atop dark cards.
  - Reveal top 8 area cards.
  - Place 1 Wildcatter disk on each oil area.
  - Add a second Wildcatter to any area with fewer than 2 drilling rigs.
- For 3 players: 8 rounds; neutral corporation in Australia with 3 rigs placed on first 3 dark cards; starting money: 15, 16, 18.
- For 2 players: Each controls one company and one corporation; 8 rounds; special chip use.

4. Gameplay Flow
Each round (7 rounds normally, 8 for 2/3 players):

   B. Receive bonus (workers, shares, VP).
   C. Building actions.
   D. Oil actions.
   E. Move own unused tankers (optional).
   F. Empty partly filled refinery (if able).
4. End of Player Turn:
   - Empty all fully filled refineries (5 barrels).
   - Active player may buy one Consolidation chip from continent of chosen card.
   - Replenish area cards to 8.
5. End of Round: Continue until all players done; proceed to next round.

- Other players with rigs may pay 3 own shares to active player to do same (once per player).
- Then auction each Wildcatter:
  - Active player may bid ≥4 own shares or pass.
  - Others with pumpjacks may bid or pass.
  - Highest bidder pays bank, places one barrel on Wildcatter.
  - Winner may use Refinery chip to empty own refinery.
  - If all pass, Wildcatter removed.

b) Develop Oilfield (D.2):
- Area must have at least one pumpjack.
- Pay 3 workers per rig converted.
- Replace own rig with pumpjack + 3 barrels.

c) Transport Oil (D.3):

- Others may join (no cost).
- Transport order:
  1. Pumpjacks → Harbor (via train; pay 1 own share per train used).
  2. Harbor → Refinery or Tanker (via train; pay 1 own share per train).
  3. Tankers → Refinery (active player moves first; owner or first loader decides destination).
- Tanker rules:
  - Moves with ≥1 barrel.
  - Max 3 barrels.
  - Unloads: owner first, then by loading order.
  - If refinery full, move to another; if all full, return to harbor.
