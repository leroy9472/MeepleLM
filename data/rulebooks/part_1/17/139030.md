## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Mascarade is a bluffing and deduction game where players take on hidden character roles, each with unique abilities. The objective is to be the first player to reach 13 coins, or to meet the win condition of a specific character (e.g., the Cheat wins with 10 coins). Players use character powers, bluffing, and card swaps to gain coins and mislead opponents.

2. Components  
- Character tiles (King, Queen, Judge, Bishop, Witch, Fool, Peasant, Cheat, Thief, Spu, Inquisitor, Widow)  
- Gold coins (used as currency)  
- Player cards (each representing a character)  
- Courthouse (central bank area where coins may accumulate)  

3. Setup  
- Place the courthouse (central bank) within reach of all players.  
- Shuffle the character deck and deal 1 card face down to each player.  
- Place the remaining character cards face up in the center (the "market").  
- Each player places their starting card face down in front of them.  
- Place the gold coins in a bank supply.  
- Determine the starting player.  

Note: If using the Peasant, both Peasant cards must be included in the game.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On their turn, a player may choose **one** of the following actions:  
1. **Swap their card** – Exchange their face-down card with another face-down card (either from the market or another player’s position).  
2. **Look at their card secretly** – Privately check their own character.  
3. **Announce a character** – Declare they are a specific character and activate that character’s power.  
   - You do **not** need to be that character to announce it.  
   - Other players may challenge the claim (see Core Mechanics).  

Play proceeds clockwise.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Bluffing & Challenges**:  
  - When a player announces a character, any other player may challenge.  
  - If challenged:  
    - The acting player reveals their card.  
    - If they **are** the character claimed, the challenger must pay them 1 coin (or 2 if the claimed character is in the market).  
    - If they are **not**, they pay 1 coin to the courthouse and their action fails.  
  - Only one challenge is allowed per action.  

- **Character Powers** (activated when announced and not successfully challenged):  
  - **King**: Gain 3 coins from the bank.  
  - **Queen**: Gain 2 coins from the bank.  
  - **Judge**: Take **all coins** from the courthouse.  
    - *Exception*: If two-thirds of the active characters have the coin purse symbol (e.g., King, Queen, etc.), the Judge cannot act and the action fails.  
  - **Bishop**: Take 2 coins from the **richest** of the other players. In case of a tie, the Bishop chooses.  
  - **Witch**: Swap **all** of their coins with another player of their choice.  
  - **Fool**: Gain 1 coin from the bank **and** swap (or not) two cards other than their own (e.g., from the market or between players).  
  - **Peasant**: Gain 1 coin from the bank.  
    - If **two Peasants** are revealed during the game (e.g., through challenge or effect), each Peasant player gains 2 coins instead of 1 when using their power.  
    - *Requirement*: Both Peasant cards must be used in the game if the Peasant is in play.  
  - **Cheat**: If the player has **10 or more coins**, announcing the Cheat (even falsely) allows them to **immediately win the game** if unchallenged or if the challenge fails.  
    - If challenged and the player is not the Cheat, they pay 1 coin to the courthouse and the game continues.  
  - **Thief**: Take 1 coin from each **adjacent player** (players to the immediate left and right).  
  - **Spu**: Look at their own card and **one other** player’s card. Then, swap them or leave them as-is.  
  - **Inquisitor**: Point at another player. That player must **guess** the Inquisitor’s character.  
    - If the guess is **incorrect**, the target pays 4 coins to the Inquisitor.  
    - If the guess is **correct**, nothing happens.  
    - After resolution, the Inquisitor reveals their card.  
  - **Widow**: Receive coins from the bank until they have **exactly 10 coins** total.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends immediately when:  
  - A player successfully uses the **Cheat** ability with 10 or more coins.  
  - Or, a player reaches **13 coins** (via any combination of powers and trades).  
- The first player to meet either condition **wins**.  
- If multiple conditions trigger simultaneously, the active player wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I announce a character not in the game?**  
  Yes, but if challenged, you will not be that character, so you lose the challenge.  
- **What if the richest player has fewer than 2 coins (Bishop)?**  
  The Bishop takes all coins they have (e.g., 1 coin). If all others have 0, Bishop gains nothing.  
- **What if the bank has insufficient coins?**  
  Pay as much as possible. The bank cannot go negative.  
- **Can I swap cards with the market using the Fool?**  
  Yes. The Fool may swap any two face-down cards that are not their own (e.g., two market cards, or a market and a player card).  
- **Can I use the Inquisitor on myself?**  
  No. You must point at another player.  
- **What happens if the courthouse is empty (Judge)?**  
  The Judge gains nothing.
