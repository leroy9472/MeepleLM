## Löwenherz — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are princes vying for power in a medieval realm. The goal is to amass the most power points by controlling territory, especially towns and hill spaces, and by acquiring parchment cards. Power is also increased through mines (triggered by action cards) and end-game scoring.

The game ends immediately when *The King is Dead!* action card is revealed. The player with the most power points wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most ducats (including treasure cards) wins.

### 3. Setup  

#### Basic Setup (Fixed Layout)  
- Assemble board frame and place map tiles A–C top row, D–F bottom row, letter at top-left.  
- Place castles and knights as shown on layout sheet.  
- Place boundary walls as shown.  
- Remove all A action cards from the game.  
- Shuffle B, C, D, and E action cards by group. Stack in order: B on top, then C, D, E. Place on blue space.  
- Set up politics cards: Shuffle 13 politics cards and split into two face-down piles of 6 and 7 on purple spaces.  

#### Variable Setup (Recommended)  
- Randomly place and orient the 6 map tiles.  
- In player order, repeat 3 times:  
  - Each player places 1 castle and 1 knight on adjacent plain (non-town, non-hill) spaces.  
  - Knights cannot be placed on wooded spaces during setup.  
  - Castles of the same color must be at least 6 orthogonal spaces apart (exclusive).  
- With 3 players: After each player places their own, they also place a castle and knight of the fourth color using the same rules.  
- Action cards: Shuffle each letter group (A–E). Stack in order with A on top, then B, C, D, E. Place on blue space.  

#### Player Preparation  
- Give each player:  
  - 3 decision cards  
  - 12 ducats (2×1, 2×2, 2×3) — kept private  
  - Power marker placed at start of power track (lion symbol)  
- Assign first player (black castle marker), usually youngest. Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

Each turn follows this sequence:

1. **Reveal Action Card**  
   - Flip top card of action deck to discard space.  
   - If card shows **Silver Mine**:  
     - Each player gains 1 power point per hill space in their enclosed regions.  
     - Reveal next action card (repeat if another Silver Mine).  
   - If card is **The King is Dead!**: Game ends immediately.  
   - Otherwise, card shows 3 actions (top to bottom). Proceed to action selection.

2. **Select Actions**  
   - Starting with first player, each player selects 1 of their 3 decision cards and places it face-down.  
     - 4-player game: First player chooses 2 cards; others choose 1.  
     - 3-player game: First player chooses 2; others choose 1.  
   - Reveal all decision cards simultaneously.  
   - Resolve the 3 actions shown on the action card **in order from top to bottom**.

3. **Resolve Each Action**  
   - For each action:  
     - If only one player selected it → they perform it.  
     - If multiple players selected it:  
       - **Power Trial**: If exactly 2 players, they may negotiate with ducats. One pays the other to yield; the other performs the action.  
       - **Duel**: If >2 players or no agreement:  
         - All tied players secretly choose any number of money/treasure cards from hand.  
         - Reveal simultaneously. Highest total wins.  
         - Winner pays amount to bank and performs the action.  
         - Losers keep their money.  
         - Tie: Duel again. If second tie → no one performs the action.

4. **Bureaucracy Phase**  
   - All players retrieve their decision cards.  
   - Pass first-player marker (black castle) to the left.  
   - Next turn begins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action Types  

**Money Bag**  
- Take shown number of ducats from bank.  
- If multiple players claim: divide total equally, round down. Each gets rounded amount.

**Boundary Walls**  
- Take shown number of walls.  
- Place on line segments between two spaces.  
- Rules:  
  - Cannot place inside an existing region.  
  - Cannot separate knight(s) from their castle (must remain connected via orthogonal path).  
  - Cannot place between two same-color pieces (knight/knight or knight/castle).  
- Scoring:  
  - If placement encloses one or more **regions** (walled area with exactly one castle), score immediately:  
    - 3 pts: 1–4 spaces  
    - 5 pts: 5–10 spaces  
    - 7 pts: 11–20 spaces  
    - 9 pts: 21–30 spaces  
    - 12 pts: 31+ spaces  
    - +5 pts per town in region  
  - Players with 3 regions cannot place walls but may still select the action.

**Single Sword and Shield**  
Choose one:  
- **Place Knight**:  
  - On empty plain (free) or wooded (cost: 5 ducats) space.  
  - Must be orthogonally adjacent to own knight or castle.  
- **Expand Region**:  
  - Add 1 or 2 spaces to one of your regions.  
  - First space must be orthogonally adjacent to your region.  
  - Second space must be adjacent to the first (after it’s added).  
  - Cannot expand into own region, allied region, or occupied space.  
  - Can expand into opponent’s region only if your region has **more knights** than theirs.  
  - Gain:  
    - 1 power point per space taken  
    - +5 per town taken  
  - Opponent loses:  
    - 1 point per space lost  
    - 5 points per town lost  
  - If expansion cuts opponent’s region:  
    - Any disconnected area without a castle becomes a **neutral zone**.  
    - Deduct points from opponent:  
      - 3 pts: 1–4 spaces  
      - 5 pts: 5–10  
      - 7 pts: 11–20  
      - 9 pts: 21–30  
      - 12 pts: 31+  
    - -5 pts per town in severed neutral zone.

**Two Swords and Two Shields**  
Choose one:  
- Place 2 knights (each following placement rules), or  
- Place 1 knight and expand 1 region (in either order).  
- Cannot do two expansions.

**Crown and Scepter**  
- Look through either face-down politics card pile.  
- Take 1 card and keep it hidden.  

**Politics Cards**  
- **Alliance**:  
  - Play when selecting an action.  
  - Choose two orthogonally adjacent regions: one yours, one another player’s.  
  - Rotate shared wall 90° to mark alliance.  
  - Effect: Neither region may expand into the other.  
  - Either player may end alliance at any time by paying 10 ducats to bank.  
- **Renegade**:  
  - Play immediately when selecting action.  
  - Remove one opponent’s knight from a region bordering yours (orthogonally adjacent).  
    - If knight is on wooded space, pay 5 ducats to bank.  
    - Cannot remove knight if it would disconnect opponent’s knight(s) from their castle.  
  - Then, place one of your knights from stock into your region (must be legal placement).  
  - **Must place knight** — if you cannot, you cannot play this card.  
- **Treasure Card**:  
  - Worth monetary value. Can be used in duels or to pay knight placement fees.  
  - No change given. Can cover multiple costs (e.g., two 5-ducat fees).  
- **Parchment Card**:  
  - Shows power points scored at game end. Keep hidden until scoring.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a wall that creates multiple regions?**  
  Yes. Score all newly created regions immediately.

- **Can I expand into a neutral zone?**  
  Yes. No penalty to others; gain 1 point per space, +5 per town.

- **Can I expand into an allied region?**  
  No. Alliances block expansion between the two regions.

- **Can I place a knight on a hill during setup?**  
  No. Setup rules prohibit knights on hills or towns.

  Yes. Treasure cards count as full value. No change.

- **What if I have no knights left but select a knight-placement action?**  
  You cannot place knights, so only valid if action allows alternative (e.g., expand). Otherwise, action is wasted.

  No. Politics cards are only played when you select Crown and Scepter as your action.

- **Do I score when I expand into a region with no towns?**
