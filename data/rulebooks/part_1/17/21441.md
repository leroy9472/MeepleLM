## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In 1899, teams of archaeologists explore Egypt in search of ancient treasures, backed by influential patrons. Players take on the roles of rival archaeologists excavating regions of Egypt across four seasons. The goal is to earn the most prestige points by claiming land parcels, leveraging patron powers, reserving prestigious museum rooms, and completing sets of patron cards.

2. Components  
- 1 game board featuring the Museum  
- 36 terrain/patron cards (tiles):  
  - 35 have a parcel (terrain side) and a patron (back)  
  - 1 parcel card has no patron on the back (scores 5 points when claimed, no endgame museum or set value)  
- 100 archaeologist cubes (25 each in blue, red, green, white)  
- 19 marker disks:  
  - 1 first player marker  
  - 6 "+" score markers (used as score markers)  
  - 12 player markers (2 per player): used on score track and passing scale  
- 5 patron markers (orange, black, brown, yellow, purple) — placed on Museum wings at setup  
- Rulebook

3. Setup  
- Place the board on the table.  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 25 cubes (their general reserve)  
  - 2 marker disks: one placed on score track at 0, one placed next to the passing scale  
- The starting player is chosen randomly. They:  
  - Shuffle the 36 terrain/patron cards (random orientation, parcel side up)  
  - Randomly place one patron marker on each of the five circular spaces around the Museum wings  
- For 2-player games: a neutral player is used (see special rules).  
- Personal stocks start empty.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts four seasons. Each season has three phases:

Phase 1 — New Season  
- Season 1–3: 8 cards are dealt to form 4 areas (2×2 grid of areas).  
- Season 4: 12 cards are dealt to form 6 areas (3×2 grid).  
- Areas consist of two adjacent cards (long sides touching).  
- Each player receives cubes into their personal stock:  
  - 3 players: 11 cubes  
  - 4 players: 8 cubes  
  - 2 players: 11 cubes + 4 neutral cubes (see 2-player rules)  
- Cubes come from the player’s reserve (general stock). If reserve is empty, take what remains.  
- Unused cubes from previous seasons remain in personal stock.

Phase 2 — Excavations  
Players take turns clockwise, starting with the first player. On a turn, a player chooses one of four actions:

A) Start a New Excavation  
- Place 1 cube from personal stock on any empty space (not on a pyramid or occupied space).  
- Must be on a free space in the current region.

B) Extend a Pre-existing Excavation  
- Place 2 cubes:  
  - First on an empty space orthogonally adjacent to one of your cubes.  
  - Second on an empty space orthogonally adjacent to the first.  
- Cannot place on pyramids.

C) Pass  
- Place your marker on the lowest-numbered free space of the passing scale.  
- You take no more actions this season.  
- Mandatory if personal stock is empty.

D) Appeal to a Patron (Available from Season 2 onward)  
- Tilt one of your patron cards (must be un-tilted this season).  
- Use the patron’s power. Only one patron action per turn.  
- Powers:  
  a) Lady Violet: Take 1 cube from your reserve to your personal stock, then perform A or B.  
  b) Lord Lemon: Perform A or B, but one cube may be placed on a pyramid space.  
  c) Sir Brown: Place 1 cube from personal stock in an empty Museum room:  
    - Any "2" or "3" room, OR  
    - A "5" room adjacent to a "2" or "3" room you control.  
  d) Mrs. Blackmore: Perform A, but place 2 cubes: first on any free space, second orthogonally adjacent to the first.  
  e) Colonel Tangerine: Perform B, but place 3 cubes in a chain (orthogonal adjacency).  

- A tilted card cannot be used again in the same season, but may be reused in future seasons.  
- A player may appeal to the same patron multiple times in a game if they have multiple cards.

End of Phase 2: When only one player hasn’t passed, that player takes one final action, then phase ends.

Phase 3 — Survey  
Evaluate each area in reading order (top-left to bottom-right):

- Rank players by number of cubes in the area.  
- Break ties: player who passed earlier (lower number on passing scale) ranks higher.  
- Players with no cubes in the area are not ranked.

Actions by rank:  
- 1st player: Choose one:  
  - Claim one of the two parcel cards in the area.  
    - Score the points shown on the cartouche (2, 3, or 5).  
    - Flip card patron-side up and place in front of you.  
  - Book a Museum room: place one cube from your general reserve (not personal stock) into an eligible Museum room.  
- 2nd player: Choose one:  
  - Claim the remaining parcel card (or either, if 1st player booked a room).  
  - Book a Museum room (if cubes remain in reserve).  
- 3rd and 4th players:  
  - May claim a remaining parcel card (if any).  
  - Cannot book Museum rooms.

After all eligible players act:  
- Unclaimed parcel cards are discarded.  
- All cubes from the area return to their owners’ reserves.  
- Proceed to next area.

End of Phase 3:  
- The last player on the passing scale becomes the first player for next season.  
- Reset passing scale (remove all markers).  
- Untilt all patron cards (ready for next season).  
- Unused personal stock cubes carry over to next season.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Region Structure**: 4 areas (Seasons 1–3), 6 areas (Season 4). Each area = 2 adjacent cards.  
- **Adjacency**: Spaces are adjacent orthogonally (not diagonally), even across gaps between cards or across cartouches.  
- **Patron Powers**: Gained by claiming parcels. Can be used once per season (per card).  
- **Museum Placement Rules**:  
  - "2" and "3" rooms: always available if empty.  
  - "5" rooms: only accessible if you control an adjacent "2" or "3" room.  
  - Each room holds at most one cube.  
- **Passing Scale**: Determines tiebreaks. Earlier pass = better rank in case of tie.

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after Season 4.

Final Scoring:

A) Exhibition at the Museum  
For each patron card a player owns:  
- 5 pts per card if player has a cube in the "5" room of that patron’s wing.  
- 3 pts per card if in the "3" room.  
- 2 pts per card if in a "2" room adjacent to the wing.  
- 1 pt per card if no presence in or adjacent to the wing.  
- If player occupies multiple rooms in a wing, use the highest value only.

Note: The unpatroned 5-point card scores only the initial 5 points and no additional points at endgame.

B) Series Bonus  
- For each complete set of five different patron cards, score 5 bonus points.  
- Multiple sets possible.

Total Score =  
- Points from claimed parcels (during game)  
+ Museum exhibition points (endgame)  
+ Series bonuses

Winning:  
- Highest total score wins.  
- Tiebreaker 1: Most cubes in personal stock.  
- Tiebreaker 2: Shared victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you use a patron power if you have no cubes?**  
  No. Lady Violet requires a cube in reserve. Sir Brown requires a cube in personal stock. Others require cubes to place.

- **Can you place in a "5" room without prior presence?**  
  No. Must control an adjacent "2" or "3" room.

- **Can you use the same patron multiple times in one season?**  
  Yes, if you have multiple un-tilted cards of that patron.

- **What if a player runs out of cubes in reserve?**  
  They receive fewer or no cubes in Phase 1, but can still use patron powers (e.g., Lady Violet) if possible.

- **What happens to cubes in the Museum?**  
  They remain for endgame scoring. Do not return to reserve.

2-Player Game Rules  
- A neutral player is controlled collectively.  
- Setup: Each player takes 11 of their color + 4 neutral cubes. Neutral passing marker starts on space 2.  
- During Excavation: After their turn, players may use neutral cubes to start (A) or extend (B) excavations.  
  - Neutral player cannot use patron powers.  
- During Survey:  
  - If neutral is 1st: 3rd-ranked player (or unranked) chooses its card.  
  - If neutral is 2nd: 1st-ranked player chooses its card.  
  - Chosen cards are discarded.  
  - If neutral is alone in an area, both cards are discarded.  
- Neutral does not score.

Nile Expansion (Optional)  
- Includes Nile cards, boat tokens, and Greenwish tokens.  
- River spaces form separate areas.  
- Governor Greenwish patron allows placing a blocking token in Museum or region.  
- Nile Survey: Majority in river area gets Nile card (prestige points). Second gets boat token.  
- Governor Greenwish cards count as wilds for completing patron sets.
