## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the roles of Master Architects—Timanis, Mirar, Leiard, and Faraiel—competing to increase their prestige within the Caliphate of Asara over four years. The objective is to earn the most Prestige Points by constructing and expanding towers, earning the Caliph’s Favor, and excelling in endgame categories such as tallest towers and largest number of towers. The player with the highest Prestige Points after Year 4 wins.

2. Components  
- Game board (5 square tiles forming a cross + 4 triangular corner tiles)  
- 100 tower component tiles:  
  - 20 Foundations (large square)  
  - 20 Sections (rectangular)  
  - 25 Windows (small square)  
  - 25 Pinnacles (trapezoid)  
- 15 Illuminated Window tiles (red-backed; for advanced version only)  
- 45 Agent cards (in 5 colors: blue, yellow, violet, green, orange)  
- 52 Asari coins:  
  - 25 × 1-Asari  
  - 16 × 5-Asari  
  - 11 × 10-Asari  
- 4 Player screens (white, purple, red, blue)

3. Setup  
- Assemble the board: connect five square tiles into a cross; place four triangular tiles in the corners.  
  - Two triangular tiles with wells: place well-side up.  
  - Two without wells: place building-side up.  
- Sort tower components into four stacks: Foundations, Sections, Windows, Pinnacles.  
- Draw and place face-up tiles in market areas:  
  - 7 Foundations  
  - 7 Sections  
  - 8 Windows  
  - 7 Pinnacles  
- Each player chooses a color/screen/score marker (white/Faraiel, purple/Leiard, red/Timanis, blue/Mirar).  
- Place Year Tracker on Year 1.  
- Form Treasury: stack Asari coins by value on board section ⑥.  
- Determine starting player: the player who most recently climbed a tower.  
  - Starting player receives Caliph’s Favor and 20 Asari.  
  - Next players receive +1 Asari each (21, 22, 23 in 4-player).  
  - All money is placed behind privacy screens.  
- Shuffle 45 agent cards and deal:  
  - 2 players: 9 cards each  
  - 3 players: 8 cards each  
  - 4 players: 7 cards each  
- Remaining agent cards form a face-down stack at board area ⑦.  
- (Advanced version): Flip well tiles to building side; place 15 illuminated windows face-down at House of Lights.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise from the starting player.  
- Each turn consists of two actions:  
  1. Place one agent card on the board.  
  2. Take the corresponding action.  
- After all players have placed all agents (some may skip turns if out of cards), the year ends.  
- Repeat for 4 years.

5. Core Mechanics  
**Agent Placement Rules (Color Requirement):**  
- In any board area:  
  - If no agents are present, place any color.  
  - If agents are present, new agent must match their color.  
  - Alternative: place two agent cards face-down on one space to bypass color requirement.  
- Exception: The multi-colored building (next to Bank) allows any player to place one face-down agent card regardless of prior agents. Unlimited use over a year, but only one per turn.

**Available Actions:**  
1. **Purchase Tower Components**  
   - Available in four Markets (Foundation, Section, Window, Pinnacle).  
   - Take one visible component from the market display.  
   - Pay cost in Asari to Treasury.  
   - Cost depends only on component color (not type or ornamentation).  
   - Costs:  
     - Brown: 2 Asari  
     - Green: 4 Asari  
     - Red: 5 Asari  
     - Black: 6 Asari  
     - White: 8 Asari  
   - Gold ornamentation (moons/suns) increases end-of-year scoring but not cost.

2. **Build and Expand Towers**  
   - Place agent on a numbered space (1–7) in the Builder’s Circle.  
   - Pay Asari equal to the space number.  
   - Use that many components to build or expand towers.  
   - Rules for towers:  
     - A complete tower requires at least one foundation and one pinnacle.  
     - All components in a tower must be the same color.  
     - Only one foundation and one pinnacle per tower.  
     - Unlimited sections and windows may be added.  
     - Players may build/expand multiple towers in one turn.  
     - Existing towers may be expanded.  
     - Components cannot be moved between towers.  
     - At turn end, only complete towers may be visible.  
   - Score 1 Prestige Point per component used.

   - **Exception:** If desired space is occupied, use next higher available space. Pay full cost, but only use number of components equal to original space number. Score only for components used.

3. **Collect Money**  
   - Place agent on lowest free space in front of Bank: collect 8, 10, or 12 Asari.  
   - OR place one agent face-down on multi-colored building: collect 5 Asari.  
   - Multi-colored building ignores Color Requirement and may be reused multiple times.

4. **Pay a Bribe**  
   - Place agent on free space in front of House of Spies.  
   - Pay 3 or 5 Asari (as marked).  
   - Choose one reserve stack (Foundation, Section, Window, Pinnacle).  
   - Look through stack, take one tile, show it to all players.  
   - Pay its normal color-based cost to Treasury.  
   - Shuffle and return stack to board.  
   - Cannot be used to buy from market displays.

5. **Earn Caliph’s Favor**  
   - Place agent on Caliph’s Favor space.  
   - Immediately take the Caliph’s Favor token from current holder.  
   - Player holding Caliph’s Favor at year end becomes next year’s starting player.

6. Scoring & End Game  
**End-of-Year Scoring (after each year):**  
- 1 Prestige Point per completed tower.  
- 1 Prestige Point per gold-decorated component in completed towers.  
- 1 Prestige Point for holding Caliph’s Favor.  
- Track points on outer board track.

**Preparing for Next Year:**  
- Remove all agent cards.  
- Shuffle and redealt:  
  - 2 players: 9 each  
  - 3 players: 8 each  
  - 4 players: 7 each  
- Refill market displays from respective stacks (leave empty if stack exhausted).  
- Pay each player 20 Asari (no bonus for turn order).  
- Retain all hidden components and money.  
- Advance Year Tracker by 1.  
- Starting player = holder of Caliph’s Favor.

**Endgame Scoring (after Year 4):**  
- **Tallest Tower by Color:**  
  - 5 colors (brown, green, red, black, white)  
  - Points: 4/2, 6/3, 8/4, 10/5, 12/6 for 1st/2nd (based on number of sections)  
- **Tallest Tower Overall:**  
  - 8 points for tallest  
  - 4 points for second tallest  
- **Most Towers Overall:**  
  - 12 points for most  
  - 6 points for second most  
- **Unspent Money:**  
  - 1 point per 10 Asari (round down)

**Tie Rules:**  
- **1st Place Tie (any category):**  
  - Add 1st and 2nd place points, divide by number of tied towers, round up.  
  - Each tied tower earns that amount. No 2nd place awarded.  
- **2nd Place Tie:**  
  - Divide 2nd place points by number of tied towers, round up.  
  - Each earns that amount.  
- **Most Towers Tie:**  
  - Divide 12 points by number of tied players.  
  - No 2nd place awarded if 1st is tied.

- Gold ornamentation and Caliph’s Favor do not score in endgame.

- **Recruit Agents:**  
  - Place agent in tent (0, 2, or 4 Asari cost).  
  - Draw 2 agent cards.

  - Place agent at House of Lights.  
  - Option 1: Pay 4 Asari → draw top 3, choose 1 secretly, return 2 to bottom.

  - Illuminated windows:  
    - Used like normal components.

    - Do not increase tower height.  
    - Score 1 point each in end-of-year scoring.  
    - Cover and cancel gold ornamentation beneath.  
- **Endgame Tiebreaker:**  
  - Illuminated windows break ties in:  
    - Tallest tower by color  
    - Tallest tower overall  
    - Number of towers (total illuminated windows counted)  
  - If still tied, points are shared.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build a tower without a foundation or pinnacle during my turn?**  
  No. Only complete towers (foundation + pinnacle) may be revealed. Components must remain hidden until tower is complete.

- **Can I use components of different colors in one tower?**  
  No. All components in a tower must be the same color.

- **Can I swap components between towers?**  
  No. Even between towers of the same color.

- **What happens if I can’t follow suit and don’t want to use two cards?**  
  You must either match the color or play two cards face-down. If you cannot or will not, you cannot act in that area.

- **Can I place on the multi-colored building if it already has agents?**  
  Yes. Unlimited agents may be placed there, one per turn.

- **Do illuminated windows count toward tower height?**  
  No. They do not increase height for scoring purposes.

- **Do gold decorations score every year?**  
  Yes. Each end-of-year, 1 point per gold-decorated component in completed towers.

- **Can I use "Bribery" to get an illuminated window?**  
  No. Bribery only applies to standard component stacks.

- **Can I use the House of Bottle Genie or Gifts of the Caliph in base game?**  
  These are expansions and not part of core rules.
