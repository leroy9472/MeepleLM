### 1. Lore & Objective
Players control heroes battling through a series of monster-filled rooms under the control of an Overseer. The goal is to survive each room and defeat the Catacomb Lord in the final chamber. Victory is achieved when at least one hero survives after reducing the Catacomb Lord’s health to zero. The Overseer wins if all heroes are defeated or incapacitated at any time.

### 2. Components
- Game boards (multiple, double-sided)
- Room cards (Level 0, 1, 2, special rooms, Catacomb Lord)
- Monster cards and monster discs (various colors, sizes)
- Hero discs (white medium), ally/familiar discs
- Shot pieces: fireball (small orange), missile (tiny yellow)
- Obstacle discs (large dark gray)
- Player mats (for heroes and Catacomb Lords)
- Spell cards, item cards, poison cards
- Currency cards (gold: 100 and 500)
- Track markers (red cubes) for health tracking
- Barrier walls (to contain pieces)

### 3. Setup
1. **Assign Roles**: One player is the Overseer; others control 1–4 heroes.
2. **Choose Heroes and Catacomb Lord**: Select 4 heroes and one Catacomb Lord. Use corresponding character discs, player mats, portrait cards, rules/setup cards, ability/spell cards.
3. **Prepare Components**:
   - Place Devoured! and Teleported! cards face-up near the Overseer.
   - Shuffle Item and Poison decks; place near Overseer.
   - Shuffle Level 0, 1, and 2 room decks separately. Stack face-down in order:
     - Random: 0 → 1 → special → 1 → 1 → special → 2 → Catacomb Lord's Lair
     - Beginner: 0 → 1 → Merchant → 1 → 1 → Healer → 2 → Catacomb Lord's Lair
4. **Hero Setup**:
   - Each hero places their disc and allies/familiars in the hero start zone.
   - Set starting health per character mat.
   - Equip starting spell and ability cards as specified.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each room proceeds through four phases:

#### 1. Exploration
- Flip the next room card.
- Determine room type: battle (monsters) or special (merchant, healer, etc.).

#### 2. Setup
- **Board**: Select and place the board shown on the room card; fill holes with obstacle discs.
- **Walls**: Assemble barrier walls around the board.
- **Monsters**: 
  - Place monster cards face-up.
  - Place specified monster discs white-side-up in the monster start zone.
- **Heroes**:
  - Place hero discs, familiars, and allies in the hero start zone.

#### 3. Battle
- Play continues in rounds until all monsters are removed or frozen.
- **Hero Turn**:
  - Heroes act one at a time, in any order.
  - Each hero completes an entire action: either executes an attack sequence or plays a spell, ability, or item card.
  - Spell/Item Use:
    - Spell cards and some items: usable once per game.
    - Ability cards and some items: usable once per room.
    - Some items have permanent effects.
- **Monster Turn**:
  - Monsters act one at a time, in any order chosen by the Overseer.
  - Each monster executes its full action sequence.
- **End of Round**:
  - Revive any disc stunned in the previous round (not the current one).
- **Friendly Fire**: None. Heroes and monsters cannot damage allies or own kind.

#### 4. Resolution
- Surviving heroes collect gold equal to the value of each monster they delivered a "kill shot" to (as shown on monster cards).
- Monsters are returned to the pool.
- Devoured! and Teleported! effects end if the room is completed.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Shots**:
  - Melee: flick character disc.
  - Missile: flick yellow disc from within 1" of character.
  - Fireball: flick orange disc; same as missile.
  - Chain shots: multiple flicks in sequence; cannot hit same target twice consecutively.
- **Shot Modifiers**:
  - Critical: 2 points of damage.
  - Stun: target misses next turn; cannot be stunned two turns consecutively.
  - Poison: 1 damage + draw a poison card.
  - Fear: 1 damage + Overseer may perform a defensive melee shot.
- **Defensive Icons**:
  - Nullifies: specified shot type does no damage or effects.
  - Reflects: nullifies shot and redirects it back at attacker.
- **Monster Types**:
  - **Shadow Monsters**: Cannot be damaged; must be knocked off the board to remove.
  - **Suppression**: If active, only melee shots are allowed.
- **Monster Family Vulnerabilities**:
  - Unmodified missile shot: deals extra effect based on family (e.g., Ice deals 1 damage before freeze).
- **Antients**:
  - Summoned via spells or items (e.g., Summon Antient, Vael’s Urn).
  - Cannot be damaged; alternate control between heroes and Overseer each round.
  - Powerful for room clearing or pressuring Catacomb Lords.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Scoring**: No traditional scoring. Gold is earned per kill shot and used to buy items/healing.
- **Victory**:
  - Heroes win by defeating the Catacomb Lord and having at least one survivor.
- **Defeat**:
  - Overseer wins if all heroes are dead, incapacitated, or devoured simultaneously.
  - A hero dies if health reaches 0 or poison cards ≥ original health.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Friendly Fire**: Not allowed. No damage between allies.
- **Off-Board Pieces**: Return to edge at point of exit.
- **Disputes**: Overseer is final arbiter.
- **Shortages**: If components (discs, coins) are missing, proceed without them.
- **Stun Rules**: Cannot stun a piece already stunned; revive at end of round.
- **Shadow Monsters**: Removed only by pushing off board.
- **Devour**: Swallowed heroes cannot act; freed when devourer is killed or room completed.
- **Antients**: Cannot be damaged; heroes control first turn after summoning.
