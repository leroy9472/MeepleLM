## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Rallyman simulates competitive automobile rallying, where 1–4 players take on the roles of rally drivers navigating timed special stages. The goal is to complete each stage as quickly as possible by managing gear shifts, risk, and terrain. Players accumulate time via Gear Cards and may reduce their total using Second Markers earned through risky maneuvers. The winner is the player with the shortest combined time across 3 special stages.

### 2. Components  
- **ZONES (C, J, L, V)**: Modular game boards that form the rally route.  
- **START and FINISH PANELS**: Mark beginning and end of each special stage.  
- **5 Black Gear Dice (1st–5th gear)**: Used for gear changes and movement.  
- **2 White Acceleration Dice**: Allow continued movement in current gear.  
- **Gear Cards (Chrono Cards)**: Record time per turn; display gear and timing (10–50 seconds).  
- **Dashboard (Control Panel Card)**: Tracks available dice and tire type.  
- **Damage Markers**: Cover dice symbols to indicate lost dice due to damage.  
- **Second Markers (⊕)**: Represent time saved; earned via Time Attack.  
- **Shortcut Cards (K Cards)**: Drawn when taking shortcuts; effects include clean passage, dirt markers, or flat tires.  
- **Sisu Card**: One-time cancellation of hazard symbols (Δ) in a turn.  
- **Spare Tire Card**: Allows tire change during a turn if in 1st gear or neutral.  
- **Course Sheet (P.C. Course Sheet)**: Tracks rally details, routes, and times.  
- **Dirt Markers**: Reduce corner note values for subsequent drivers.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Appoint Race Director**: One player organizes the rally.  
2. **Determine Special Stages (SS1–SS3)**: Combine 1–4 ZONES; define start, junction, and finish points for each stage.  
3. **Mark Course Sheet**:  
   - Record rally name, date, and driver names.  
   - Describe each special stage’s route.  
   - Indicate assistance periods (recommended after SS1 and SS2).  
4. **Prepare Board**: Assemble ZONES and place START and FINISH PANELS.  
5. **Distribute Player Components**:  
   - Each player gets a dashboard, Sisu Card, and Spare Tire Card.  
   - Choose tires (asphalt or snow) after weather is revealed (if using ART.15).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each player takes turns in sequence. A turn consists of three phases:

#### Phase 1: Choose Gear and Roll First Die  
- If starting or restarting after loss of control: must roll 1st Gear Die.  
- Otherwise: may roll a die one gear above, one below, or same as last engaged gear, or use an Acceleration Die.  
- Move car forward 1 space after rolling.

#### Phase 2: Chain Gears (Roll Additional Dice)  
- Roll remaining dice one at a time, moving 1 space per roll.  
- Rules:  
  - Gears must be sequential (±1 from previous).  
  - Acceleration Dice may be used at any point.  
  - Each die used only once per turn.  
  - Must respect corner, bump, and shortcut notes.  
  - Accumulating 3 Δ symbols (or 2 on asphalt tires in snow) causes **Loss of Control**.  

#### Phase 3: End Turn and Draw Gear Card  
- End turn voluntarily, due to risk, or lack of legal dice.  
- Take Gear Card matching last engaged gear (not Acceleration Die).  
- Place card on chrono pile (face up; time visible).  
- Time on card adds to total stage time.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Time Attack (Optional)  
- Roll multiple dice simultaneously (min. 2).  
- Arrange dice in legal gear sequence.  
- Move 1 space per die.  
- Gain 1 Second Marker per die rolled.  
- If 3 Δ appear (or 2 on snow with asphalt tires), loss of control occurs at 3rd Δ; unused dice not moved.  
- Cannot combine with basic technique.  

#### Spending Second Markers (Optional)  
- Before rolling a die, spend markers to lock a die result (no roll).  
- Cost: 1 marker for 1st die, +2 for 2nd (total 3), +3 for 3rd (total 6), etc.  
- Prevents Δ accumulation; cannot be used during Time Attack.  

#### Corners  
- **Inside Trajectory**: Gear ≤ note on inside. Lower gear allowed.  
- **Skidding Trajectory**: Must use exact gear noted on outside. Car placed sideways.  
- **Shortcut (K)**: Gear ≤ note on brown space. Draw K Card:  
  - **Good Shortcut**: No effect.  
  - **Dirty Corner**: Place Dirt Marker; reduce corner notes by 1 for future drivers.  
  - **Punctured Tire**: Lose 1 Acceleration Die (mark on dashboard). 3 flat tires = elimination.  

#### Bumps (▲)  
- **Reduced Speed (gear < note)**: Move 1 space (into bump).  
- **Recommended (gear = note)**: Jump to next space (2 total).  
- **Excessive (gear +1)**: Jump 2 spaces ahead (3 total); if Δ rolled, loss of control.  
- **+2 Gears**: Immediate loss of control; jump 3 spaces ahead (4 total).  

#### Loss of Control (LoC)  
Triggered by:  
- 3 Δ in one turn (2 if asphalt tires on snow).  
- Corner taken 1–2 gears above note.  
- Bump taken +1 gear with Δ, or +2 gears.  

**Effects**:  
- Move car to space where 3rd Δ occurred.  
- Draw Gear Card, flip to LoC side, place on chrono pile.  
  - **Spin Out**: Car stays on road, reversed.  
  - **Off Road**: Move car off road (per card arrow); terrain determines damage.  
- Next turn: Start in 1st gear; reposition car accordingly.  

#### Damage  
- Occurs when LoC forces car off road.  
- Terrain determines damage (per ZONE legend):  
  - Grass/Dirt: No damage  
  - Forest: Lose 1 black die  
  - Rocks: Lose 2 black dice  
- Mark on dashboard with Damage Markers.  
- Repaired during assistance.  

#### Overtaking  
Allowed only if:  
1. Straight section, room to pass.  
2. Through shortcut while opponent is on corner.  
3. Through corner while opponent is on shortcut.  
4. Opponent is off-road.  
- Multiple cars can occupy same space if space allows.  
- If blocked, end turn.  

#### Weather & Tires (Optional)  
- **Snow Zones**: Determined by rolling Gear Dice per ZONE; Δ = snow.  
- **Tire Choice**: Made at start of first stage and during assistance.  
  - **Asphalt Tires on Snow**: 2 Δ = LoC.  
  - **Snow Tires on Asphalt**: Only 1 Acceleration Die allowed per turn.  

#### Assistance (Between Stages)  
- Repair all damage (remove Damage Markers).  
- Recover Spare Tire Card if used.  
- Change tires.  
- Recommended after each stage for new players.  

#### Sisu Card  
- Play once per game to cancel all Δ symbols in a single turn.  
- Cannot cancel LoC from corner or bump errors.  

#### Spare Tire Card  
- Use at start of turn if in 1st gear or neutral.  
- Remove one flat tire (Damage Marker from white die).  
- Can be used between stages (card discarded).  
- Recovered only during assistance.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- After each special stage:  
  - Sum all times on Gear Cards in chrono pile.  
  - Subtract number of Second Markers held.  
  - Convert to MM:SS format.  
- Race Director records times on Course Sheet.  
- **Starting Order for Next Stage**:  
  - SS2: Based on SS1 time (fastest starts first).  
  - SS3: Based on combined SS1+SS2 time.  
- After SS3: Player with shortest total time wins.  

#### Finishing with LoC  
- If LoC occurs while crossing finish line:  
  - Stage completed.  
  - Add Gear Card (do not flip).  
  - Suffer 1 damage (mark on dashboard).  
- Damage persists if no assistance before next stage.  

#### Split Times (Optional)  
- Race Director marks checkpoints.  
- Drivers announce cumulative time at each.  
- Used for strategic adjustments.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Multiple Cars in Same Space**: Highest gear plays first; tie: first arrival.  
- **Shortcut LoC**:  
  - Road → Shortcut: Stay on shortcut, draw K Card.  
  - Shortcut → Road: Return to road, inside trajectory.  
- **Flat Tire Timing**: Lost die not used in current turn; affects future turns.  
- **Time Attack Limits**: Cannot roll more dice than spaces to finish.  
- **Gear Card After LoC**: Always take card for last gear used; flip if LoC.  
- **Spare Tire Between Stages**: Card discarded; not available next stage unless assistance.  
- **Weather Roll**: Done per ZONE at start of each special (if using variable weather).
