### 1. Lore & Objective
TITAN is a fantasy war game for 2–6 players. Each player commands a force of monstrous characters, led by a single Titan. The objective is to be the last player with a Titan remaining. If a player's Titan is eliminated, they are out of the game and all their Legions are removed. Victory is achieved by eliminating all other Titans.

### 2. Components
- 1 Masterboard (game map with 96 Lands)
- 6 double-sided Battleland sheets (27 hexes each)
- 13 Counter Sheets (572 pieces total)
  - Character counters: Titans (6), Angels (18), Archangels (6), Demi-Lords (Guardians, Warlocks), and 19 Creature types
  - Legion Markers (72 total, 12 per player)
  - Damage chits (for tracking hits)
  - Attacker/Defender marker
- 20 six-sided dice
- 1 Scoring Track and 18 score markers (3 per player)
- 1 Turn Marker
- 1 Rulebook

### 3. Setup
1. Place the Masterboard in the center of the table.
2. Each player takes:
   - One Titan counter and one set of 12 color-coded Legion Markers.
   - Two Legions, both placed on the same Tower Land.
3. Assign starting characters:
   - Each player receives: 1 Titan, 1 Angel, 2 Centaurs, 2 Gargoyles, 2 Ogres.
   - Distribute these into two Legions: 3 Creatures and 1 Lord per Legion.
   - Assignments are confidential.
4. Determine starting order:
   - Each player rolls a die to determine starting Tower Land (ignoring zeros in multiples of 100).
   - Re-roll ties.
   - The player assigned the highest-numbered Tower plays first.
5. Sort character counters by type and place them nearby.
6. Designate one player as caretaker (distributes counters) and one as scorekeeper.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each Game-Turn has four phases, taken by the current Mover:
1. **Commencement Phase**: Split existing Legions into new ones (optional).
2. **Movement Phase**: Roll a die, then move at least one Legion according to movement rules and signs.
3. **Engagement Phase**: Resolve any battles triggered by entering enemy-occupied Lands.
4. **Enlistment Phase**: Eligible Legions may muster one new character.

Turns proceed clockwise until only one player remains.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Legions
- A Legion is a stack of up to 7 character counters under a Legion Marker.
- Legions move as single units on the Masterboard.
- A full Legion (7 characters) cannot muster or summon.
- Legions may split if both resulting Legions have at least 2 characters. After movement, if multiple Legions occupy the same Land, they recombine.

#### Movement on Masterboard
- The Mover rolls a die to determine movement distance.
- A Legion must move the full distance unless it enters an enemy-occupied Land (triggering an Engagement).
- Movement follows directional Signs (Blocks, Spheres, Arrows, Triple Arrows) on Land borders.
  - **Block**: Must move in that direction if last move ended on that Land.
  - **Sphere**: May move in that direction.
  - **Arrow**: On Tower Lands, may move in any Arrow direction; otherwise, may continue in one Arrow direction but not backtrack.
  - **Triple Arrow**: May start move in that direction (unless Block present); if entered during move, must continue in that direction.
- A Legion may pass through a friendly Legion’s Land but cannot end there.
- **First Move Mulligan**: On their first turn only, a player may re-roll the movement die; the second roll is binding.

#### Teleportation
- **Tower Teleportation**: A Legion with a Lord starting in a Tower Land may teleport on a 6. It may move to any vacant Tower or up to 6 Lands away (ignoring signs and enemies). The Lord must be revealed.
- **Titan Teleportation**: When a player has 400+ points and their Titan has Power 10+, the Titan Legion may teleport on a 6 to any Land with an enemy Legion, initiating battle. The Titan must be revealed.
- Only one Legion may be teleported per Movement Phase.

#### Engagements
- Triggered when a moving Legion enters an enemy-occupied Land.
- The moving player is the attacker; the other is the defender.
- The Mover chooses resolution order if multiple Engagements occur.
- Resolution options:
  - **Flee**: Defender may flee (if no Lord in Legion), eliminating their forces. Attacker wins, scores half value (rounded down).
  - **Agreement**: Both players agree to eliminate at least one Legion. Full points awarded to winner; mutual elimination scores nothing.
  - **Concession**: One player concedes, eliminating their Legion. Winner scores full value.
  - **Battle**: Fought on a corresponding Battleland.

#### Battle and Battlelands
- Fought on a 27-hex Battleland matching the terrain of the Engagement.
- **Entry**:
  - Attacker enters from a 4-hex side (same as entry on Masterboard).
  - Defender enters from opposite 3-hex side.
  - In Tower Battles: attacker enters from lower-left side; defender deploys inside walled area (no first move).
  - With Titan Teleportation: attacker chooses entry side.
- **Battle Rounds**:
  - Each round: Defender’s Maneuver Phase → Strike Phase → Attacker’s Maneuver Phase → Strike Phase.
  - Exception: In Tower Battles, attacker moves first.
  - Battle ends when one or both Legions are eliminated, or after 7 full rounds (defender wins with no score).

##### Maneuver Phase
- Moving player moves characters one at a time.
- Characters may move up to their Skill factor in hexes.
- **Hazards**:
  - **Slowed**: Some terrain (e.g., Bramble, Drift) costs 2 movement to enter.
  - Flying characters ignore all hazards until landing.
  - Non-flying characters cannot enter occupied hexes; flying characters may pass over but not land in them.
  - Characters in contact with enemies (adjacent hexes) may not move (except across Cliffs).
- Characters not entered during first Maneuver Phase are eliminated.

##### Strike Phase
- Two types: **Regular Striking** and **Rangestriking**.
- **Regular Striking**:
  - All characters adjacent to enemies must strike.
  - Attacker strikes first (all attacks), then defender.
  - To strike: roll Power-factor number of dice.
  - Strike-number (needed to hit) is determined by cross-referencing attacker and target Skill factors on Strike Chart.
  - Each die ≥ Strike-number is a hit.
  - Character is slain when hits ≥ its Power-factor.
  - Extra hits may carry over to adjacent enemy if Strike-number is not higher.
  - Damage is simultaneous; slain characters still strike.
- **Rangestriking**:
  - Only the moving player may use it.
  - Only characters with Bow/Arrow symbol may rangestrike.
  - Cannot rangestrike if in contact with enemy.
  - Range-strength = half Power-factor (rounded down); this is the number of dice rolled.
  - Maximum range = character’s Skill factor (counting all hexes), max 4.
  - At range 4, attacker’s Skill is reduced by 1 for Strike-number calculation.
  - Line of sight must be clear (blocked by terrain, characters, unless Warlock or elevation exception).
  - Warlocks ignore all rangestrike blocks and reductions.
  - Lords are immune to rangestrikes except from Warlocks.

#### Reinforcements
- Defender may muster one reinforcement at start of their 4th Maneuver Phase.
- Must qualify to muster from the current Land.
- Enters from defender’s entry side.
- Only one reinforcement per Battle.

#### Summoning Angels
- Only attacker may summon.
- During Battle: After first Strike Phase in which defender loses a character, during attacker’s next Maneuver Phase.
- After Battle: If attacker wins (except by flee), may summon immediately.
- Summoned Angel must be from a non-engaged Legion.
- Legion cannot have 7 characters.
- Only one Angel per Engagement Phase.

#### Mustering
- A Legion may muster one character per Game-Turn if:
  - It moved and survived Engagement, or is defending in Battle.
  - It has fewer than 7 characters.
- **General Mustering**:
  - Must contain any Creature listed for the current terrain.
  - May muster a "like" Creature or any lesser one.
  - May upgrade if it has required number of lower Creatures (per Masterchart).
- **Tower Mustering**:
  - May muster any Tower Creature (Centaur, Gargoyle, Ogre) regardless of contents.
  - May muster Warlock if Titan or Warlock is present.
  - May muster Guardian if three identical Creatures or a Guardian is present.

#### Scoring and Titans
- **Scoring**:
  - Winner adds value of losing Legion’s characters to score.
  - Value = Power-factor × Skill-factor.
  - Flee: half value (rounded down).
  - Mutual elimination: 0 points.
- **Acquiring Angels**:
  - At every 100 points, may add an Angel to winning Legion (if <7 characters).
  - At 500, 1000, etc., may take Archangel instead.
- **Titan Power**:
  - Starts at 6.
  - +1 Power per 100 points scored.
  - At 400+ points and Power 10+, gains Titan Teleportation.
- **Titan Death**:
  - When Titan is slain, Battle ends.
  - If attacker slays defender’s Titan and survives, they score all slain characters from Titan’s Legion.
  - Eliminated player’s Legions are removed; half value scored to engaged opponents.
  - Killer gains loser’s Legion Markers.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends when only one player has a Titan.
- That player wins.
- **Alternative Endings**:
  - Time limit: Add score + value of remaining Legions. Highest total wins.
  - Point target: First to reach target (e.g., 300) at end of turn wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Simultaneous Combat**: All strikes resolve simultaneously; slain characters still attack.
- **Contact and Cliffs**: Characters on opposite sides of a Cliff are not in contact and may move.
- **Rangestrike Line of Sight**: When line passes along hexside, attacker chooses which hex it passes through.
- **Carry-over Damage**: Only allowed if second target has equal or lower Strike-number. Can be enabled by declaring higher Strike-number.
- **Hazard Effects**: Listed in Hazard Chart (e.g., Drift damages non-natives each Strike Phase).
- **Flying Characters**: May pass over occupied hexes but not land in them. Land at end of move.
- **Multiple Engagements**: Resolved one at a time in order chosen by Mover.
