## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Tensions aboard a colony ship escalate when sabotage causes a crash on a frozen, uncharted planet. Players represent rival factions striving to rescue crew and settle warm subterranean caverns before the sun sets and surface conditions become lethal. The goal is to score the most stars by settling crew pods in caverns, completing missions, and gaining majorities.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Each player:  
   - Chooses a color and takes matching platform, 3 drones, 15 crew pods, 4 material markers, 1 energy peg, and 2 reference cards.  
   - Places drones on the 3 leftmost docks of their platform.  
   - Places:  
     - Crystal (♂) on "1" of pink track  
     - Organic (♀) on "1" of green track  
     - Tech (♂) on "1" of grey track  
     - Nanite (♀) on "0" of purple track  
     - Energy peg (●) on "1" of energy track  
3. Determine first player. Others receive bonuses:  
   - Second player: +1 Crystal  
   - Third player: +1 Crystal, +1 Tech  
   - Fourth player: +1 Crystal, +1 Tech, +1 Organic  
4. Place 1 crew pod of each player color in every stasis chamber. Add 1 extra crew pod to each of the 3 large stasis chambers on the right.  
5. Shuffle resource tiles by back design and form stacks:  
   - On each resource space (Engineering, Lab, R&D), place a face-down stack of tiles equal to player count.  
   - Flip the top tile face-up.  
6. Randomize damage markers and place face-up on matching dock symbols based on player count.  
7. Shuffle cavern tiles and place one face-down on each cavern space. Flip face-up the two highlighted caverns.  
   - Spaces marked "3+" or "4" are used only in games of that player count.  
8. Shuffle incident tokens into two piles: Early and Late.  
   - Place 1 Early incident token face-up on each of the 4 incident spaces.  
   - On each space of the incident track, place a face-down stack of incident tokens equal to player count (Early on Early spaces, Late on Late spaces).  
   - Place the Sunset token beneath the rightmost stack.  
9. Shuffle the 40-card deck and place it near the board.  
10. Deal 5 cards to each player.  
11. Each player keeps 3 cards, discards 2.  
12. Max hand size: 5 cards. Replenish by reshuffling discard pile if deck runs out.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, you must choose one of two actions:  

#### DEPLOY  
- Available if at least 1 drone is on your platform.  
- Choose 1 drone from your platform and place it on any open dock (no drone or damage token).  
- Take 1 adjacent action (up to 4 per dock).  
- Actions and Costs:  
  - **Stasis Control**: Spend up to 3● to take up to 3 crew pods from stasis chambers in that section to your platform (space permitting).  
  - **Resource Space**: Take top face-up resource tile. Choose:  
    - Return to box → gain benefit shown (e.g., 1♂+1♀, 1♂ or 1♀, 1●, draw/play 1 card)  
    - Place on empty slot of your platform → customize a platform action (see Platform Actions)  
    - If stack is empty, gain the material shown on the space.  
  - **Reactor**: Spend up to 3● to gain equal amount of●.  
  - **Fabricator**: Spend up to 3 materials (♂,♀,♂,♀) to gain equal amount of nanites (♀).  
  - **Computer**: Spend up to 3●; for each, draw 1 card or play 1 card. Declare choices before drawing.  
  - **Scout**: Spend 1● and 1♂ to flip 1 face-down cavern tile. It must be adjacent to a face-up tile. Place 1 crew pod from your platform in the newly revealed cavern.  
  - **Assign to Salvage**: Place 1 crew pod from your platform on any empty salvage space (Dispatch section). Third space available only in 3–4 player games.  
  - **Withdraw from Salvage**: Take up to 3 of your crew pods from salvage spaces and return them to your platform.  
  - **Launch**: Choose 1 vehicle on your platform with ≥1 crew pod. Choose a tunnel connected to ≥1 face-up cavern. Spend● equal to the number of● symbols along the path. Pay settlement cost(s) for connected cavern(s). Place crew pods from the vehicle into the cavern(s). Discard the vehicle card.  

#### RECALL  
- Available if at least 1 of your drones is on the board.  
- If all 3 drones are on the board, you must recall.  
- Steps (in order):  
  1. **Recover Salvage**: For each of your crew pods on salvage spaces, gain 1 material of the type shown (crew pods stay).  
  2. **Resolve Incident**:  
     - Choose 1 face-up incident token from any ship section.  
     - Resolve:  
       - **Sabotage**: Place sabotage token on lowest-numbered stasis chamber in that section without one. Destroy all crew pods in that chamber (remove to side). If all 3 chambers destroyed, resolve in another section.  
       - **Looting**: Gain benefit (materials, energy, card actions). Keep token near your platform for scoring (e.g., Plunder mission).  
       - **Sunset**: Game ends at end of your turn. Keep token near platform.  
     - Replace with top token from leftmost stack on incident track. If stack empty, leave space empty.  
  3. **Return Drones**:  
     - Return each drone one at a time to an open dock on your platform.  
     - After each return, you may take the associated platform action if fully upgraded.  
     - Platform Actions:  
       - **Custom I**: Gain benefit of resource tile below arrow (no cost).  
       - **Awaken**: Pay cost above arrow to take 1 crew pod from any stasis chamber to your platform.  
       - **Charge**: Pay cost above arrow to gain 1●.  
       - **Custom II**: Pay cost above arrow to gain benefit below arrow.  
       - **Fabricate**: Pay cost above arrow to gain 1♀.  
       - **Compute**: Pay cost above arrow to draw or play 1 card.  

#### SCRAP  
- Once per turn, at any time, you may:  
  - Scrap 1 card from hand → gain benefit shown on card (e.g., 1♂+1♀)  
  - Scrap 1 resource tile from your platform → gain benefit shown on tile  
- Scrapped cards go to discard pile; scrapped tiles return to box.  
- Returning a tile to box via Resource Space action is **not** scrapping.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Drones**: Only 3 per player. Deploy to board to act, recall to platform to trigger platform actions.  
- **Resource Tiles**: Used to upgrade platform actions or scrapped for immediate benefit.  
- **Incidents**: Triggered during Recall. Drive tension and interaction.  
- **Caverns**: Primary scoring zone. Must be revealed (Scout), accessed via tunnel (Launch), and settled by paying cost.  
- **Vehicles**: Transport crew pods to caverns. Discarded upon launch.  
- **Missions**: Played face-down; score stars at end based on conditions.  
- **Upgrades**: Provide ongoing abilities (e.g., Prototype, Overclock).  
- **Nanites (♀)**: Can be spent in place of any 1 material (♂,♀,♂) at a 1:1 ratio.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### End Game Triggers (end of any turn):  
- A player resolves the **Sunset** token.  
- Any player has **all 15 crew pods in caverns or destroyed**.  

#### Scoring (in stars ★):  
- 2★ per crew pod in caverns  
- 1★ per upgrade and vehicle on platform  
- 1★ per crew pod on platform or on a vehicle  
- ★ shown on mission cards played  
- Cavern Majorities:  
  - Each cavern shows two ★ values: higher for majority, lower for second.  
  - Most pods: scores higher ★  
  - Second most: scores lower ★  
  - Tie for first: all tied score lower ★; no second score  
  - Tie for second: no one scores second ★  
- **Winning**: Most ★ wins.  
  - Tie: Player with most crew pods in caverns wins.  
  - Still tied: Shared victory.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I scrap during Recall?** Yes, once per turn at any time.  
- **Can I assign a pod to salvage and withdraw same turn?** Yes.  
- **Can I launch without paying full settlement cost?** No.  
- **Can I launch to a cavern not connected by a tunnel?** No. Must use tunnel with ● symbols.  
- **What if sabotage hits a chamber with no crew pods?** Token is placed; no effect.  
- **Can nanites be used to pay for●?** No. Nanites replace materials, not energy.  
- **Can I have more than 5 cards?** No. Max hand size is 5. Discard down if necessary.  
- **Can I scrap a tile used to upgrade an action?** Yes. Benefit is gained; tile returns to box.  
- **Can I play a card and draw a card in same Computer action?** Yes, if you spend 2●: one to draw, one to play.
