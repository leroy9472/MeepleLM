## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Cash 'n Guns*, players are rival gangsters who have just completed a heist and must now divide the loot. Tensions rise, guns come out, and trust evaporates. The goal is to survive all 8 rounds and end the game with the most money. Players use bluffing, intimidation, and strategy to eliminate rivals or secure their share—without getting shot.

**Win Condition**: The richest surviving player after 8 rounds wins. If only one player remains alive earlier, they win immediately.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has up to 8 phases. The game lasts 8 rounds unless a winner is determined earlier.

#### Round Phases:
1. **Add Loot**  
   - 5 banknotes drawn from deck and placed face up.  
   - Unsplit loot from previous rounds remains on table.

2. **Choose Bullet Card**  
   - Each player secretly selects one unused Bullet card.  
   - Place it face down to the right of their character.

3. **Aim**  
   - Godfather counts to 3.  
   - On "3", all players simultaneously point their foam gun at a target.  
   - Late or hesitant aiming = bullet lost.

4. **Withdraw ("Cojones?")**  
   - Godfather counts to 3 again.  
   - Players may lay down their character to **withdraw**.  
     - They discard their Bullet card face down.  
     - Take one Shame marker.  
     - Out of the round.  
   - Players who stay shout **"Cojones!"** (or equivalent).  
   - Decision is simultaneous and binding.

5. **Bang! Bang! Bang! Resolution**  
   - Players who aimed someone still standing and played **"Bang! Bang! Bang!"** reveal it.  
   - Targeted player:  
     - Takes 1 Wound marker  
     - Discards their Bullet card face down  
     - Lays character down  
   - All "Bang! Bang! Bang!" shots resolve simultaneously.

6. **Remaining Cards (Bang! and Click)**  
   - Remaining standing players reveal their card:  
     - **Click Click Click!**: Nothing happens.  
     - **Bang!**: Targeted player takes 1 Wound, lays down, discards card.  
   - Multiple hits = multiple wounds.  
   - A player wounded in Phase 5 can still be wounded in Phase 6.  
   - All played cards discarded.

7. **Split the Loot**  
   - Only players with character **still standing** (not withdrawn, not wounded) split the loot.  
   - Money divided **equally in whole banknotes**—no change allowed.  
   - Distribute largest denominations first.  
   - Any unsplit money remains on the table for next round.

8. **[Cop Mode Only] The Telephone**  
   - After split, players who participated pass the **Telephone card** under the table clockwise.  
   - Only the **Cop** may flip the card to "Used" (secretly).  
   - When card returns to table:  
     - If "Used", flip top **Telephone Switchboard** card.  
     - After **third** switchboard card is revealed:  
       - Reinforcements are on the way.  
       - Cop may **withdraw only once more**.  
       - Shame markers flipped to "flashing light" side to track post-alert withdrawals.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Wounds**:  
  - Each hit = 1 Wound marker.  
  - 3 Wounds = player eliminated. Money lost.  
  - Possible to take multiple wounds per round.  

- **Shame Markers**:  
  - Taken when withdrawing.  
  - Cost $5,000 each at game end (unless Super Power modifies).  

- **Bullet Cards**:  
  - Each used once per game.  
  - "Bang! Bang! Bang!" resolves before "Bang!" — prevents target from shooting.  
  - "Click Click Click!" = bluff.  

- **Simultaneous Actions**:  
  - Aiming, withdrawing, and shooting are all simultaneous. No take-backs.

- **Super Powers (Revealed when used):**  
  1. **#01 - 6 Feet Under**: Gain $10,000 per **killed player** at game end.  
  2. **#02 - The Unbreakable**: Die only on **4th wound**. Reveal on 3rd wound.  
  3. **#03 - You Don't Need It**: When first player dies, take their gun and unused bullets. Play **two cards per round**, aim two targets.  
  4. **#04 - Dragon Skin**: Max **1 wound per round**. Reveal when hit by multiple bullets.  
  5. **#05 - The Insane**: Reveal in **first 3 phases**. When you take your **next wound**, all **non-withdrawn, non-wounded** players also take a wound. One-time use. Ends round.  
  6. **#06 - The Kid**: Choose your target **after all others** in Phase 3. Reveal before Phase 3.  
  7. **#07 - The Cunning**: Choose your Bullet card **after seeing who is aiming whom** (end of Phase 3). Reveal before Phase 3.  
  8. **#08 - Super Coward**: Gain **$5,000 per Shame marker** at game end.  
  9. **#09 - The Specialist**: Use your **"Bang! Bang! Bang!"** card **twice**. Reveal after first use; take it back and discard another card.  
  10. **#10 - It Does Not Hurt!**: Join loot split **even if withdrawn or wounded**. Reveal at start of Phase 7. One-time use. Does not work if grenade exploded.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you aim someone who withdrew?**  
  Yes, but your shot does nothing. Discard your card face down.  

- **Can you wound someone already lying down?**  
  No. Withdrawn or wounded players cannot be targeted in Phases 5–6.  

- **What if no one can split the loot?**  
  Money stays on table. Carries over to next round.  

- **Multiple players die in same phase (e.g., grenade)?**  
  For **You Don't Need It**, choose which dead player’s cards to take.  

- **Can The Kid and The Cunning be used together?**  
  Yes. **The Kid decides first**, then **The Cunning** chooses bullet after seeing targets.  

- **Can The Insane be used more than once?**  
  No. One-time use. Round ends immediately after explosion.  

- **What if the Cop is eliminated before making 3 calls?**  
  Cop fails. Richest surviving gangster wins.  

- **Can you use Super Powers after dying?**  
  Only **6 Feet Under** and **Super Coward** are revealed post-death. Others must be used while alive.
