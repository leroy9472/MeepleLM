# VTES Automa: Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
This document describes an automa system for Vampire: The Eternal Struggle (VTES), enabling solo or reduced-player games. The automa simulates opponent behavior using a standard 52-card deck to determine actions. The objective is unchanged from standard VTES: accumulate the most victory points by ousting opponents (including automatons) and being the last player standing.

2. Components  
- Player’s crypt and library decks  
- Blood and Edge tokens (for player and automa)  
- Standard 52-card playing deck (used for automa decision-making)  
- Automa crypt deck (recommended: 80-card deck of vampires with varied clans, sects, groups, and traits; no game text for simplicity)  

3. Setup  
- Set up your side of the game as normal (untap phase, crypt, library, starting pool, etc.).  
- Shuffle the automa’s crypt deck and deal 4 cards face up.  
- Allocate 30 blood counters to the automa.  
- Place the automa’s vampires in the ready region, unlocked.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Automa takes turns in the normal turn order.  
- During the automa’s turn, each phase occurs as in standard VTES, but actions are determined by drawing from the 52-card deck and consulting a grid (not provided here).  
- All automa vampires must take an action each turn. “Pass” means the vampire remains unlocked but takes no action.  
- Automa turns proceed through:  
  1. Untap Phase  
  2. Master Phase  
  3. Minion Phase  
  4. Influence Phase  
  5. Discard Phase  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Action Resolution**:  
  - When the automa’s vampire attempts to bleed and is not blocked, it draws action modifier cards until bleed value increases or a “Pass” card is drawn.  
  - When blocked and stealth ≤ intercept of blocker, the automa draws action modifier cards to increase stealth until successful or a “Pass” is drawn.  
  - When attempting to block and intercept < acting minion’s stealth, the automa draws reaction cards to increase intercept until successful or a “Pass” is drawn.  
- **Blocking Rules**:  
  - If able to block and has ready, unlocked vampires, one must attempt to block.  
  - If all automa vampires are locked, draw a “Forced Awakening” card to attempt a block.  
  - While a “Yes” result is drawn from “Forced Awakening,” continue drawing for subsequent blocks.  
  - A “Pass” result stops further “Forced Awakening” draws for that turn.  
  - When choosing a blocker, select the automa vampire with the most blood counters.  
- **Combat**:  
  - If the automa’s vampire is in combat, it draws a combat card:  
    - If acting, draw when combat begins.  
    - If reacting, draw after the opposing minion plays or declines their first combat card.  
    - Continue drawing after each opposing combat card is played.  
- **Political Actions**:  
  - Each titled automa vampire gains its standard votes.  
  - Then, draw a “Vote” card repeatedly to attempt to gain extra votes until a “Pass” card is drawn.  
  - Automas always vote against player and other automa referendums.  
- **Hunting**:  
  - Vampires with no blood must hunt.  
  - If a hunt action is drawn but the vampire is at full blood capacity, draw another card.  
- **Invalid Actions**:  
  - If a card effect cannot be applied (e.g., bleed modifier during non-bleed action, multiple “Dodge” in one combat), draw another card.  
  - Reshuffle the 52-card deck if it runs out.  
- **Influence Phase**:  
  - If the automa can take control of a vampire in its uncontrolled region, it spends transfer points and pool to do so.  
  - Otherwise, spends transfer points on the youngest vampire.  
  - If control is gained and transfer points remain, spend them on the youngest vampire.  
  - Skip influence phase if automa controls at least 3 vampires or has 10 or fewer pool.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Standard VTES victory conditions apply:  
  - Gain 1 victory point when your prey is ousted.  
  - Gain 6 pool when your prey is ousted.  
  - Gain 1 additional victory point if you are the last player remaining.  
- Game ends when only one player remains or after a time limit (e.g., 2 hours).  
- Winner is the player with the most victory points, regardless of whether ousted.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: What if the automa draws an effect that cannot be applied?  
  A: Draw another card until a valid effect is found.  
- Q: Can the automa play the same action multiple times in a turn?  
  A: No, per standard VTES rules—minions cannot repeat the same action in a turn.  
- Q: What if the automa crypt deck runs out?  
  A: The document does not specify; assume no replacement unless house-ruled.  
- Q: How are ties in voting resolved?  
  A: Per standard rules—tied referendums fail.
