## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Mariposas*, players guide monarch butterflies through their annual migration across North America. Each spring, butterflies leave Michoacán, Mexico, spreading northward; in fall, they return. No single butterfly completes the full round trip — generations succeed one another along the journey.

**Objective**: Earn the most victory points over three seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall) by:
- Completing seasonal goals
- Hatching new generations
- Collecting Life Cycle and Bonus Move Waystation cards
- Returning Generation 4 butterflies to Michoacán

The player with the most points after Fall wins. Tiebreakers are applied if needed.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Play proceeds clockwise over **three seasons**:
- **Spring**: 4 turns per player
- **Summer**: 5 turns per player
- **Fall**: 6 turns per player

Each **player turn** follows this sequence:

#### 1. Play 1 Action Card
- Choose and play **1 card** from your hand face-up in front of you.
- Cards show movement patterns (e.g., Move 1 space three times, Move 5 spaces, etc.).
- Movements may be split among multiple butterflies.

#### 2. Execute Movement and Landing Actions (Repeat per Butterfly Moved)
For each movement action:
- Move a butterfly along connected hexes.
- Upon landing, resolve the following steps **in order**:

##### A. Collect Location Bonus
- **Flower Space**: Take **1 flower token** matching the space.
  - Cannot collect from the **same space twice** in a single turn.
  - A butterfly **cannot collect from its starting space** this turn.
- **Waystation City**:
  - If **first to land** on a face-down Waystation:
    - Flip it over.
    - Roll the **Flower Die**.
    - Take a flower token of the rolled type (wild = choose any).
  - All players may collect the **bonus shown on the Waystation Tile** (e.g., Life Cycle Card, Bonus Move Card).
  - **No duplicates**: You cannot collect a second copy of any Waystation Card.

##### B. Collect Adjacent Flower Tokens (if card allows)
- Some Action Cards (e.g., "Move 4 and take a flower from an adjacent space") let you collect from an adjacent space **in addition** to your landing space.

##### C. Hatch New Butterfly (if adjacent to Milkweed)
- If your landing space is **adjacent to a milkweed symbol**, you may **hatch** a new butterfly of the next generation.
  - Pay required **flower tokens** (see Hatching Costs).
  - Take the new butterfly from:
    1. **Season Goal Cards** (if available), then
    2. Your supply.
  - Place the new butterfly in the same space.
  - Hatching is **optional** and occurs **after** collecting flowers or waystation rewards.
  - You may hatch **once per landing** if adjacent to milkweed.

##### D. Repeat for Each Movement
- If your card allows multiple moves (e.g., Move 1 three times), you may move the same or different butterflies, resolving all steps above for each landing.

#### 3. Draw Back to 2 Cards
- Draw from the Action Deck to restore your hand to **2 cards**.
- **Redraw Rule**:
  - If your hand contains **two identical cards** or **two "Reuse" cards**, you may **discard and redraw one or both**.
  - Reused cards are not replaced until your hand drops below 2.

- Played cards remain face-up in front of you to track **turn count per season**.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Movement
- Action Cards determine movement options.
- Examples:
  - **Move 1 × 3**: Use as 3 separate 1-space moves (same or different butterflies).
  - **Move 2 × 2**: Two 2-space moves.
  - **Move 1 + Move 3**: In any order.
  - **Move 5**, **Move 4 + Adjacent Flower**, etc.
- Butterflies can share spaces; no limit per space.

#### Waystation Bonus Move Cards
These are special cards collected during play:
- Held in hand as **extra cards** (you may have >2 cards).
- Not replaced after use.
- Cannot be duplicated.

Types:
- **MOVE 3, MOVE 2**: Play **instead of** an Action Card. Grants one 3-space and one 2-space move.
- **+1 MOVE**: Play **with** an Action Card. Adds one **separate** 1-space move.
- **+2 TO A MOVE**: Play **with** an Action Card. Adds **2 spaces** to **one** movement action (not a separate move).

#### Hatching Costs
| Parent Generation | Offspring | Cost |
|-------------------|---------|------|
| Gen 1 | Gen 2 | 2 matching OR any 3 flowers |
| Gen 2 | Gen 3 | 3 matching OR any 4 flowers |
| Gen 3 | Gen 4 | 4 matching OR any 5 flowers |
| Gen 4 | Double Gen 4 | 4 matching OR any 5 flowers |

- **Double Gen 4**: Flip the butterfly; counts as **2** for scoring (e.g., in Michoacán), but moves as one unit.

#### Life Cycle Sets
- Collect all 4 cards (Egg, Caterpillar, Chrysalis, Adult) of one color to complete a set.
- **Reward**: Gain the corresponding **Life Cycle Ability Token**:
  - **Green**: Score 1 VP at game end. Whenever you hatch, score 1 VP immediately.
  - **Pink**: Score 1 VP at game end. Immediately gain 1 of each flower type.
  - **Blue**: Score 3 VP at game end. After Fall’s 6th turn, all players who completed this set take **one extra turn** in turn order.
- **Life Cycle Cards** are worth **1 VP each** at game end.

#### Revealing Season Goal Cards
- **Spring**: Revealed at game start.
- **Summer**: Revealed when **all Gen 2 butterflies** are removed from its card.
- **Fall**: Revealed when **all Gen 3 butterflies** are removed from its card.
- If not revealed by season end, **flip it immediately** and return any remaining butterflies to owners’ supplies.
