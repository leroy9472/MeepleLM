## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
The island of Vul-Kar is a treacherous, dynamic playground of rolling marbles, rotating trees, and ancient dangers. Players are guests tasked with retrieving treasures and snapshots while surviving the chaotic island mechanics. The ultimate goal depends on the ruleset in play:

- **Cooperative Objective (Curse of Vul-Kar variant)**: Retrieve the Heart of Vul-Kar and bring it to the Hello-copter. However, *all players must first collect 6 tokens of a single color and one snapshot of that same color* before the Heart can be legally taken. Once taken, the Heart must be carried onto the Hello-copter to win.  
- **Standard Competitive Objective**: Be the player with the highest score when the Hello-copter returns. The copter returns when any player reaches the helipad with at least three different colored snapshots, or when the Scar contains four marbles.

2. **Components**  
- 1 modular island (3 regions)  
- 1 Vul-Kar figure  
- 4 red Fireball marbles (+1 extra)  
- 6 orange Ember marbles (+1 extra)  
- 4 player figures + reference cards  
- 1 Heart of Vul-Kar crystal  
- 1 Ladder, 2 Bridges  
- 7 Trees (with roots)  
- 30 Action cards  
- 12 Snapshot cards (3 per region: red, yellow, blue; 1 special on Wreck of the Crimson Cutlass worth 10 pts)  
- 12 Souvenir cards  
- 36 Treasure tokens (in multiple colors)  
- 1 Lucky Penny token  
- 1 Maw (treasure discard holder)  
- 1 Cataclysm tracker  
- 1 Hello-copter  
- 1 Cave die (d3)  
- Optional: expansions (Boulder, Tiger, Bees, Golden Idol, etc.)

3. **Setup**  
- Assemble the island. Place Vul-Kar atop the summit, facing the helipad.  
- Insert 7 trees with roots pointing toward Vul-Kar.  
- Place 6 Ember marbles on the fire pits in the center region. Place 1 Fireball marble in the Scar.  
- Place the Heart of Vul-Kar on its slab near Vul-Kar.  
- Randomly place 36 treasure tokens face-up on treasure slabs. Place leftover tokens (if any) in the Maw.  
- Place the Lucky Penny in the Maw.  
- Place the Cataclysm tracker next to the Scar with the remaining 3 Fireball marbles.  
- Place snapshot cards face-up beside their respective regions.  
- Shuffle souvenir deck, deal 1 face-down to each player. Set remainder aside.  
- Shuffle action deck, deal 2 face-down to each player.  
- Each player places their figure on the Hello-copter.  
- Youngest player goes first. First move is always from Hello-copter to helipad.

*For Curse of Vul-Kar (Cooperative Variant):*  
- Place all 4 Fireballs in the Scar.  
- Do not deal action cards initially.  
- Remove Tote Bag and Snow Globe souvenirs from the deck (return both copies to box).  
- Draw 3 non-Cataclysm action cards and place them in the Cataclysm tracker. Replace any Cataclysm cards drawn until 3 non-Cataclysm cards are in the tracker; reshuffle Cataclysms back into the deck.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
On your turn, follow these steps in order:

1. **Stand Up (if knocked over)**  
   - If your figure is knocked over, stand it up on the same space.  
   - If in a river/lava chute: move to the end and stand up.  
   - If off the island: choose any cave to start in.  
   - If in an odd location: choose the nearest valid space.

2. **Play an Action Card**  
   - In standard rules: play a card from your hand.  
   - In Curse of Vul-Kar: choose one of the 3 cards in the Cataclysm tracker, then play it.  
   - Move the full number of spaces shown. You may choose direction but cannot change direction mid-move.  
   - You may not stop on a space occupied by another player; hop over them into the next available space.  
   - Unstable spaces (bridges, ladder) stop movement.  
   - If you land on or pass a cave, roll the cave die and teleport to a matching-numbered cave if available.

3. **Take Action (after moving)**  
   - Perform the action on the card: rotate Vul-Kar/tree, launch an Ember marble, or trigger Cataclysm.  
   - For Ember Marbles (Flame Geyser or Lava Blast cards): launch the marble so it rolls onto a snapshot space (red, yellow, blue) in your current region. If you miss, discard a souvenir card from your hand or a non-Cataclysm card from the tracker.

4. **Draw a New Card**  
   - In standard rules: draw 1 action card.  
   - In Curse of Vul-Kar: refill the Cataclysm tracker to 3 cards after your turn.

5. **Reset the Island**  
   - Return all marbles to their starting positions: Ember marbles to summit, Fireballs to Scar.  
   - Reset bridges and ladder if moved.  
   - Do not reset knocked-over figures (they stand at start of next turn).

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Snapshots**: Take one when entering or starting on a snapshot space, if:  
  - You don’t already have one of that color.  
  - Cards are still available.  
  - No other player is in that space.  
  - The Wreck of the Crimson Cutlass snapshot is worth 10 points and only 2 are placed if playing with 2–3 players.

- **Treasures**: Grab when entering or starting on a treasure space. Keep face-down.  
  - Scoring: 1/3/6/10/15 points for 1/2/3/4/5+ of same color.  
  - Heart of Vul-Kar = 7 points.  
  - Lucky Penny = 6 points.

- **Getting Knocked Over**:  
  - Triggered if any part of figure (not base) touches island or is off island.  
  - If knocked over by another player: they steal one treasure; you draw a souvenir.  
  - If self-knocked: place one treasure in Maw; draw a souvenir.  
  - Heart of Vul-Kar: if carried, return to slab.  
  - Discard souvenir or tracker card (Curse of Vul-Kar).

- **Stealing the Heart**: If you pass the carrier, you may steal it.

- **Cataclysm! Card**:  
  - Play it: discard to tracker.  
  - If tracker fills with 3 Cataclysm cards: reshuffle all played action cards (including tracker) and add a Fireball to the Scar.  
  - If 4th Fireball enters Scar: game ends immediately.

- **Passing Players**: When passing, you may exchange one token or steal the Heart.

- **Souvenirs**:  
  - Play when legal (per card text).  
  - Return used or discarded souvenirs to the box (do not reshuffle).  
  - In Curse of Vul-Kar: when forced to discard, choose from hand or non-Cataclysm in tracker.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
**End Game Triggers (Standard Rules):**  
- A player enters the helipad with at least 3 different colored snapshots.  
- The Scar contains 4 marbles (after a Cataclysm reshuffle).  
At the end of the turn, the Hello-copter returns.

**End Game Triggers (Curse of Vul-Kar):**  
- Loss if:  
  - Cannot refill Cataclysm tracker (deck empty).  
  - All 3 tracker slots contain Cataclysm cards.  
- Win if:  
  - Heart of Vul-Kar is carried onto the Hello-copter, *and* all players have 6 tokens + 1 snapshot of the same color.

**Game End Procedure:**  
- Place Hello-copter near helipad.  
- Players may enter from helipad (no exact count needed). May enter same turn copter appears if moves remain.  
- Upon entry: take one token from Maw (Lucky Penny or treasure).  
- Players in copter cannot be knocked over, moved, or robbed.  
- Game ends when all players are in copter or all have taken 2 turns after copter arrival.

**Scoring (Standard Rules):**  
- Add points from treasures and snapshots.  
- Snapshots: 5 points each (10 for Crimson Cutlass).  
- Only snapshots *in* Hello-copter score.  
- Tiebreaker:  
  1. First to reach helipad.  
  2. If neither reached: closest to helipad.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Heart of Vul-Kar as Treasure**: Yes. If knocked over while carrying it, may place it in Maw.  
- **Grabbing Heart**: Immediately add a Fireball from tracker to Scar.  
- **Two Players**: Each controls 2 figures. Shared snapshots and cards. Must have 6 total snapshots to summon copter.  
- **Selfie Stick**: Awards 2 extra points per *different* colored snapshot.  
- **Knocked Over in Caves/Rivers**: Follow odd starting space rules.  
- **Ember Marble Leaves Island**: Place one of your treasures in Maw; stand up knocked figures without penalty.  
- **Table Bumps**: Reset everything; ignore effects.  
- **Vibration Knockdowns**: Count as knocked over; thief may gain treasure.  
- **Cursed Sapphires**: Draw back up to 2 action cards at end of turn.  
- **Boulder off Map**: No treasure loss to Maw.
