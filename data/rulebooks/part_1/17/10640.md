## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
- The Marines must complete scenario objectives (e.g., retrieving key cards, reaching exit points, disabling self-destruct sequences) while surviving waves of demonic Invaders.  
- The game ends in victory if Marines complete all objectives and escape or disable critical threats (e.g., self-destruct).  
- The game ends in defeat if the shared Health Pool is reduced to zero or the station explodes (if self-destruct is active and not disabled in time).

2. Components  
- Game board with modular map tiles  
- Marine and Invader miniatures  
- Invader Cards (66 total: 45 Event, 21 Spawn)  
- Marine Equipment Boards (3)  
- Area-Setup Cards (Black, Red, and Green bordered)  
- Health tokens, ammo tokens, armor tokens, specialty cards  
- Dice (Green and Yellow)  
- Reference sheets, record sheets  

3. Setup  
- Choose a scenario and assemble the map accordingly.  
- Prepare Area-Setup Deck:  
  - Select Black-border cards for Normal difficulty, Red-border for Nightmare.  
  - Use Green-border cards for key items and "?" spaces:  
    - Remove key cards matching color-key doors in the scenario.  
    - Create a deck equal to the number of "?" spaces, using key cards and filler Green cards. Shuffle and set aside.  
- Prepare Invader Deck:  
  - Shuffle all Invader cards.  
  - Optional: Split deck, reveal one card from bottom half, and shuffle. When this card is drawn, players have 5 turns to escape or disable self-destruct.  
- Set up Health Pool:  
  - Multiply number of major areas (excluding hallways) by 7. Use tokens or substitutes.  
- Assign Marines:  
  - Deal Marine cards, armor, ammo, grenades, health, and specialty cards per player count:  
    - 1 Marine: 3 armor, 5 ammo, 2 grenades, 15 health, 3 specialty cards  
    - 2 Marines: 2 armor, 3 ammo, 1 grenade, 10 health, 2 specialty cards  
- Prepare Area Setup:  
  - Reveal top Area-Setup card (Black/Red) and place items/monsters as numbered.  
  - For rooms numbered >10, reuse the card (1 = 11, etc.).  
  - X on a number = no placement beyond that point.  
  - For multi-space monsters, place freely within designated space.  
  - If spawning blocks movement, affected figure takes damage and moves randomly to nearest unoccupied space.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Marine Phase:  
   - Marines take turns clockwise. Each may move, attack, use items, or perform actions.  
2. Invader Phase:  
   - Draw and resolve one card from the Invader Deck.  
   - Activate all Invaders in order:  
     a. Ranged Invaders move and attack.  
     b. Melee Invaders move and attack.  
   - Follow Invader Characteristic Chart for behavior.  
3. Repeat until objective is completed or game is lost.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Invader AI Rules (Co-Op):  
  - Ignore timing conditions on Invader cards.  
  - All targeting choices: select nearest Invader to a Marine.  
  - Marine targeting: choose closest Marine to final objective.  
  - Apply "Grim Rule": always choose worst outcome for Marines.  
- Invader Deck Split (Co-Op):  
  - Event Deck: Spawn, Dud, Jammed!, Rage, Not Quite, Dark Energies, Panic  
  - Room Deck: Sealed In!, Shaky Footing, Jump the Gun, Ambush, It's a Trap!, Darkness  
  - Other cards not used.  
- Event Deck:  
  - Draw 1 card at start of Invader turn. Resolve immediately.  
  - Spawn cards: spawn all listed Invaders, ignoring spawn limits.  
  - "First weapon" = last weapon used by Marine player.  
- Room Deck:  
  - When a Marine enters a new room (revealed but never entered), draw and resolve 1 Room card.  
  - "Your next turn" = next Marine turn.  
- Invader Spawn Order:  
  - Melee and Ranged Invaders spawn at nearest possible point to a Marine.  
- Invader Turn Order:  
  - All Ranged Invaders activate first (move and attack nearest Marine).  
  - All Melee Invaders activate second (move and attack nearest Marine).  
- Invader Behavior:  
  - Melee: move to nearest Marine and attack.  
  - Ranged: maintain distance equal to total Distance value:  
    - Yellow die = +2, Green die = +1, Accuracy symbol = +1  
    - Examples: Imp (3), Mancubus (3), Archvile (8), Cyberdemon (4)  
  - After attacking, Ranged Invaders move away to avoid line of sight if possible.  
  - Use remaining movement to unblock other Invaders or hide.  
- Invader Characteristic Chart:  
  - Zombie: moves to closest Marine; prioritizes low armor, low adjacent Invaders, same color.  
  - Imp: moves within 3 spaces, attacks, then retreats.  
  - Trite: attacks closest Marine, retreats via ducts if possible.  
  - Mancubus: moves within 3 spaces of nearest Marine; prioritizes Marine near unopened door.  
  - Hell Knight: targets Marine nearest to closed security door; uses knockback toward entry door.  
  - Demon: attacks closest Marine, then moves non-adjacent.  
  - Archvile: moves within 6 spaces, attacks, retreats.  
  - Cyberdemon: targets Marine nearest to closed security door; moves toward door after attack.  
- Scatter Chart:  
  - On a miss, use chart:  
    - Top row = spaces missed by.  
    - First column = Yellow die result.  
    - Intersection = scatter result.  
- Damage:  
  - All damage reduces shared Health Pool.  
  - If pool reaches zero, Marines lose.  
- Spawn Limit (House Rule):  
  - Max spawn cards = (X + 1) per revealed area, where X = number of Marines.  
  - Total spawn cards scale with revealed areas.  
- AmmCOSTREDUCTION (House Rule):  
  - Marine loses only 1 ammo token per ammo type per turn, regardless of number of attacks.  
  - Applies to Unload, Guard, blow-through, and special abilities.  
- Frag Mode (Solitaire):  
  - Earn Frag tokens per defeated Invader:  
    - Zombie/Trite/Imp/Cherub/Z-Commando: 1  
    - Demon/Maggot/Mancubus/Archvile/Revenant: 2  
    - Hell Knight/Cacodemon: 4  
    - Cyberdemon/Vagary: 6  
  - Spend at teleporters:  
    - 2 Frags: 1 ammo (bullets/shells/energy), 1 adrenaline  
    - 3 Frags: 1 health, 1 grenades/rockets, 1 machine gun  
    - 6 Frags: 1 armor, 1 chainsaw, 1 shotgun  
    - 9 Frags: 1 rocket launcher, 1 plasma gun, 1 sentry bot  
    - 12 Frags: 1 BFG, 1 berserk, 1 invisibility, 1 megasphere  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Victory: Complete all scenario objectives (e.g., collect keys, disable self-destruct, escape).  
- Defeat:  
  - Shared Health Pool reaches zero.  
  - Self-destruct sequence completes without intervention (if active).  
- No formal scoring; success is binary.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: What if multiple Marines are equidistant?  
  A: Use tiebreakers from Invader Characteristic Chart: least armor, least adjacent Invaders, same color.  
- Q: Can Ranged Invaders block each other?  
  A: No — use "Grim Rule" to unblock or hide.  
- Q: What happens when a spawn blocks a Marine?  
  A: Marine takes damage and moves randomly to nearest free space.  
- Q: How are Area-Setup cards reused for rooms >10?  
  A: 1 = 11, 2 = 12, etc. Follow numbering strictly.  
- Q: What if a required event (e.g., key from scientist) occurs in solo?  
  A: It happens automatically. Optional events (e.g., BFG combo) succeed on 4–6 on d6.  
- Q: Can Marines exceed ammo limits?  
  A: No — ammo is tracked per type and lost per AmmCOSTREDUCTION rule.
