- **Can Explorers be in enemy territory?** Yes. They do not control Provinces.  
- **Can I move last Unit from a Province with an Outpost?** Yes. Outpost maintains control.

- **Can I develop multiple Cultural Policies per turn?** Yes, if you can pay increasing Culture costs.  
- **Do activated cards in Atlantis’ Nexus get replenished?** Yes. At end of turn, move activated Nexus cards to right end, straighten.
