- **Photo card**: Adds **$1,000** to the reward when played.  
- **Stagecoach Robbery**: On success, adds **$3,000**.  
- **Bank Robbery / Fastest Gun**: On success, adds **$1,000**.  

#### Sheriff Cards  
- Only **one Sheriff card per turn** may be played, **unless** a Sheriff card is drawn from the discard pile via Wyatt Earp and played immediately.  
- Cards with numbers are played to a player’s own Outlaw sets.  
- Cards with symbols are played to the discard pile or opponents’ cards.

| Card | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Photo (7)** | After a first set is played, may be played (even out of turn). Adds **+4 CP** and **$1,000** to reward. May be played alone. Other Sheriff cards may be played on it. |
| **Stagecoach Robbery (2)** | Requires successful shot (draw a card with bullet hole). On success: **+1 CP**, **+$3,000**. On failure, card is discarded. |
| **Bank Robbery (4)** | Same as Stagecoach, but **+2 CP**, **+$1,000**. |
| **Fastest Gun (3)** | Same as Stagecoach, but **+3 CP**, **+$1,000**. **Removes any existing Fastest Gun** on that outlaw. Only one Fastest Gun per outlaw allowed. |
| **Most Wanted! (3)** | Two options:<br>1. **From hand (no shot)**: Ask players (clockwise or counterclockwise) for a specific Outlaw card. First player with it must give it to you.<br>2. **From territory (with shot)**: On success, steal **any Outlaw card** (even under Hideout) from another player’s table. |
| **Hideout (3)** | After successful shot, play on **any player’s Outlaw set**. All cards under it **do not count for CP**. Reward is unchanged. Player may still add cards. Removed only by Wyatt Earp. Cannot stack. |
| **Wyatt Earp (7)** | Choose one:<br>1. **Draw 2 cards** from draw pile.<br>2. **Take 1 card** from discard pile (not another Wyatt Earp). If it’s a Sheriff card, may play it immediately (exception: allows 2 Sheriff cards this turn).<br>3. **Remove 1 Hideout** from your own Outlaw after successful shot.<br>**Out of turn use**: May play Wyatt Earp **immediately after a Hideout is played on you** to attempt removal (requires successful shot). |

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End of a Hand Triggers When:  
1. A player discards their **last card**.  
2. Another player has **no cards** when the current player ends their turn.  
3. The **draw pile is exhausted for the second time** in the hand.  
   - If the last action was resolving a shot, complete it before ending the hand.

#### Scoring Process (per outlaw, clockwise)  
For each outlaw:  
1. **Total CP Check**: Sum all CP for that outlaw across all players (excluding cards under Hideout).  
   - If **< 8 CP**: No reward paid. Money stays on poster.  
   - If **≥ 8 CP**: Proceed.  
2. **Solo Capture?**  
   - If the top player has **at least 5 CP more** than the second: they take **entire reward**.  
   - Else: **Shared reward**.  
3. **Shared Reward Distribution**:  
   - The player(s) with the **most CP** take **$2,000**.  
   - Then, each player **within 5 CP of the leader** takes **$1,000** in descending CP order.  
   - Repeat **round-robin** ($1,000 per player per round) until:  
     - Money runs out, **or**  
     - Remaining money is insufficient to pay **all tied players** at the current tier.  
   - Any leftover money stays on the poster.

#### End of Game  
- After scoring, if **any player has ≥ $25,000**, the game ends.  
- The player with the **most money wins**.  
- **Tiebreaker**: All tied players draw and reveal a card simultaneously.  
  - Any player revealing a **blank card (no bullet hole)** is eliminated.  
  - If all reveal blanks, draw again.  
  - Repeat until one player remains.

#### Next Hand Setup (if no one has $25k)  
- Dealer rotates clockwise.  
- Shuffle all cards and deal 10 to each player.  
- Draw pile and discard pile reset.  
- Add **$1,000** to each reward poster from the Bank.
