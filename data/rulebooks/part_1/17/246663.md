## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In NEOM, players build a futuristic city over three generations by placing tiles to develop infrastructure, produce goods, and generate victory points (VP). The goal is to maximize VP through strategic tile placement, neighborhood development, and resource management while avoiding penalties. The player with the most VP at the end wins.

### 2. Components
- 6 City Boards (5×5 grids)
- 85 Good Tokens:
  - 6 Raw Goods: Coal, Natural Gas, Oil, Ore, Stone, Wood
  - 8 Processed Goods: Concrete, Copper, Diamond, Glass, Gold, Lumber, Plastics, Steel
  - 3 Luxury Goods: Electronics, Jewelry, Sports Cars
- 150 Tiles:
  - 40 each of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Generation Tiles
  - 30 Cornerstone Tiles
- 65 Coin Tokens (L-Coins): 29×£1, 18×£5, 12×£20, 6×£50
- 1 Scoring Pad
- 3 Luxury Good Tokens (reference only)

### 3. Setup
1. Each player takes a City Board and places it in front of them.
2. Take the Raw Good token matching the City Center’s good and place it above your board.
3. Each player receives £6.
4. Place remaining Goods and coins in the general supply.
5. Separate Cornerstone tiles and Generation tiles.
6. Shuffle Cornerstone tiles; deal 4 to each player. Players draft 3 via a passing draft (pass left), then discard the fourth.
7. Separate Generation tiles into three decks (1st, 2nd, 3rd Gen). Remove tiles not applicable for player count (based on “1+”, “4+”, “5+” icons). Shuffle each deck.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 3 Generations (rounds), each with 7 turns.

#### Preliminary Round
- Draft 3 Cornerstone tiles using a 4-tile draft with leftward passing.

#### Each Generation
1. **Deal**: Each player gets 8 tiles from the current Generation deck.
2. **7 Turns**:
   - **A. Select a Tile**: Simultaneously choose one tile from hand and place it face down. Pass remaining tiles to the left.
   - **B. Take an Action**: Reveal selected tiles. Take one of:
     - Place the Selected Tile
     - Place a Cornerstone Tile
     - Sell the Tile for Money
     - *Exception*: If a Disaster tile is selected, no action is taken; it triggers at end of turn.
   - **C. Pick Up Tiles**: Receive passed tiles for next turn.
3. **End of Generation**:
   - Collect income from income-generating tiles.
   - Return leftover tile (after 7th turn) to the box.

After 3rd Generation, collect final income and proceed to scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Tile Placement
- Must connect via road to the City Center (or replaced City Center tile).
- Roads need not connect continuously; only a path to the City Center is required.
- Tiles cannot be rotated.

#### Actions
- **Place Selected Tile**:
  - Pay cost (coins or goods) shown on tile.
  - Goods must be produced by your city or bought from other players.
  - Replace existing tile only if:
    - Existing tile is Resource (grey), or
    - New tile shares type with existing tile.
  - City Center (Resource) can be replaced by any tile.
- **Place a Cornerstone Tile**:
  - Return selected Generation tile to box.
  - Place one of your drafted Cornerstone tiles.
  - Max one Cornerstone tile per Generation (1 in Gen 1, 2 in Gen 2, 3 in Gen 3).
- **Sell Tile for Money**:
  - Return selected Generation tile to box.
  - Gain £5.
  - Cannot sell Disaster tiles.

#### Buying Goods
- Base cost: Raw (£2), Processed (£4), Luxury (£10).
- Transport Fee: +£1 per player between you and seller (clockwise or counterclockwise).
- Trade Route Discount: -£1 per active Trade Route (left or right border), max -£2 in solo.
- Must buy from player if they produce the good; otherwise, from supply at same cost.

#### Trade Routes
- Establish by connecting a road to left or right border.
- Active Trade Routes reduce good purchase cost.
- Remain active if road connection exists, even if disconnected from City Center.

#### Disasters
- One per Generation: Flood (1st), Fire (2nd), Crime Spree (3rd).
- Selected by a player → affects all others at end of turn.
- No action taken by the player who selected it.
- Affected players choose:
  - Pay penalty, or
  - Sacrifice required tiles.
- Cannot discard Disaster tiles for money or to place Cornerstones.

**Disaster Effects**:
- **Flood**: Pay £1 per non-grey tile, or lose one non-grey tile.
- **Fire**: Pay £1 per unprotected non-grey tile, or lose two tiles.
- **Crime Spree**: Pay £2 per unprotected (non-grey, non-orange) tile, or lose three tiles (one green, one blue, one yellow).

*Protection*:
- Fire/Police Protection from adjacent Public tiles (e.g., Fire Department, Police Department).
- Protected tiles not counted in payment.
- No protection from Flood.
- No protection from tile removal.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Score after final income in 3rd Generation.

#### Victory Points
- **Tiles**: Sum VP on Residential and Public tiles. Variable VP tiles scored per their effect.
- **Neighborhoods**: Residential tiles connected by roads form clusters. Score:
  - 1 tile: 1 VP
  - 2: 3 VP
  - 3: 6 VP
  - 4: 10 VP
  - 5: 15 VP
  - 6: 21 VP
  - 7: 28 VP
  - 8: 36 VP
  - 9+: 36 + 4 VP per additional tile
- **Goods**: Score once per type:
  - Raw: 1 VP
  - Processed: 2 VP
  - Luxury: 10 VP
- **Money**: 1 VP per £2 (round down)
- **Pollution**: For each Residential tile:
  - -2 VP per orthogonally adjacent Polluting (yellow/orange) tile
  - -1 VP per diagonally adjacent Polluting tile
- **Ghost Town**: -10 VP if no Residential tiles; -4 VP if only one
- **Power**: -5 VP if no Power-generating tile (lightning bolt symbol)

Total all categories. Highest score wins. Tie = shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I place a tile that disconnects part of my city?**  
  Yes. Cut-off tiles retain benefits but cannot be expanded unless reconnected.
- **Can I replace a tile with a different type?**  
  Only if original is Resource (grey) or types match.
- **Do I lose Good tokens when replacing a producing tile?**  
  Yes, if it was the last tile producing that Good.
- **Can I use Trade Routes in multiplayer?**  
  Yes, each active route reduces cost by £1 (not cumulative beyond two routes).
- **Can I avoid a Disaster by not selecting it?**  
  Yes. Disaster only occurs if a player selects it.
- **Can I have more than one of the same Good token?**  
  No. One per Good type.
- **Does Pollution penalty stack per tile or per adjacency?**  
  Per adjacency. One Polluting tile can penalize multiple Residential tiles.
