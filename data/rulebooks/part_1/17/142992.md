## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Gravwell*, players control spaceships that have survived a black hole and now float in a distorted dimension where gravity pulls toward the nearest object. The goal is to escape by being the first to **enter or pass space #54 (the Warp Gate)** on the spiral track. If no one reaches it by the end of **Round 6**, the player **closest to the Warp Gate** wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Game Board (spiral path from Singularity to Warp Gate at space #54)  
- 26 uniquely lettered Fuel Cards (A–Z), each with a number and type  
- 4 colored Emergency Stop! Cards (one per player)  
- 6 Spaceship Miniatures (4 player ships + 2 Derelict ships)  
- 1 Round-Tracking Pawn  
- Rulebook and variant guides  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place board in center.  
2. Place **Derelict ships**:
   - 2-player: one on space #36  
   - 3–4 players: one on #26 and one on #36  
3. Each player:
   - Chooses a colored spaceship and places it in the **Singularity** (center/start space)  
   - Takes matching **Emergency Stop! card**, places it **face up** in front  
4. Place **Round-Tracking Pawn** on "1" at bottom of board.  
5. Shuffle all 26 Fuel Cards.  
6. Deal **N × 3** stacks (N = player count), each with:
   - 1 face-down card  
   - 1 face-up card on top  
7. Set remaining cards aside (unused this round).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has two phases:  
#### Draft Phase  
- **Round 1**: Youngest player chooses first; others draft in age order.  
- **Rounds 2–6**: Draft order is **last place to first place** (furthest from Warp Gate drafts first).  
- Each player takes one stack (2 cards) at a time until all stacks are gone.  
- Players look at both cards, then place all 6 face down as their hand.  

#### Fuel Card Play Phase (6 Movement Phases)  
For each of 6 phases:  
1. All players **simultaneously** choose one Fuel Card and place it face down.  
2. All cards revealed at once.  
3. Resolve in **alphabetical order** by card letter (A first, Z last).  
4. After resolution, **discard card** to common discard pile.  
5. Repeat until all 6 cards are played.  
6. **End of Round**:  
   - Flip **Emergency Stop! card face up** if used.  
   - Shuffle all 26 Fuel Cards.  
   - Advance Round-Tracking Pawn.  
   - Start new round unless Round 6 just ended.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Movement Basics  
- All movement counts **occupied spaces** when moving over them.  
- **No two ships may occupy the same space**.  
- If movement ends on an occupied space, **move forward one additional space** (repeat until unoccupied).  
- **Derelicts**:
  - Count as ships for movement and gravity.
  - Do not move unless affected by Tractor Beam.
  - Cannot be landed on; trigger forced move if ended upon.

#### Card Types  
- **Standard (Yellow) Fuel Card**:  
  - Move toward the **nearest ship** (not in Singularity).  
  - If in Singularity, move forward toward Warp Gate.  
- **Repulsor (Purple) Card**:  
  - Move **away from nearest ship**.  
  - If in Singularity, **no movement occurs**.  
- **Tractor Beam (Blue) Card**:  
  - **Your ship does not move**.  
  - **All other ships** (including Derelicts and those in Singularity) move **toward you** by card number.  
  - Resolve in order: **closest to you first**, then outward.  
  - Tie in distance? Move **ship closest to Singularity first**.  
  - If multiple ships in Singularity, **active player chooses order**.  
  - **Emergency Stop! cannot block Tractor Beam movement**.

#### Direction Determination  
- **Nearest Ship**:  
  - Measure distance to all ships **not in Singularity**.  
  - Closest one determines direction.  
- **Tie in Distance (equidistant front/back)**:  
  - Count total number of ships (excluding those in Singularity) on each side.  
  - Move toward side with **more ships**.  
  - If still tied, **do not move**.  
- **Singularity Rules**:  
  - Ships in Singularity **do not count** for movement direction or tie-breaking.  
  - Standard move from Singularity: **always forward**.  
  - Repulsor from Singularity: **no effect**.  
  - Tractor Beam from Singularity: **still pulls others**.

#### Emergency Stop! Card  
- Can be used **once per round**.  
- When your card resolves:  
  - Flip **Emergency Stop! card face down**.  
  - **Discard your Fuel Card with no effect**.  
- After round ends, **flip Emergency Stop! back face up** (refreshed).  
- **Cannot save for future rounds**; unused cards do not carry over.  
- **Does not stop Tractor Beam effects**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Immediate Win**: First player to **land on or pass space #54 (Warp Gate)** wins **immediately**.  
- **No one reaches Warp Gate by end of Round 6**?  
  - Player **closest to Warp Gate** (highest space number) wins.  
  - If tied, closest wins (no tiebreak rule specified).  
- Game ends after **Movement Phase 6** of the round in which the first player entered the Warp Gate.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you move backward?**  
  Yes. If nearest ship is behind you, you move backward.  
- **What if I end up back in Singularity during movement?**  
  Stop moving. You do not continue.  
- **Does Tractor Beam affect Derelicts?**  
  Yes. They move toward the active player.  
- **Can Emergency Stop! cancel a Tractor Beam I play?**  
  Yes. You can cancel your own Tractor Beam (but not others’).  
- **Do I move if I’m surrounded and tied on both sides?**  
  No. If equidistant and ship count tied, you do not move.  
- **Can a ship pass the Warp Gate and still win?**  
  Yes. Passing or landing on #54 counts as winning.  
- **What happens to unused Fuel Cards after draft?**  
  They remain out of play until next round shuffle.  
- **Can I see other players’ hands?**  
  No. Hands are secret after draft.  
- **What if multiple players are in Singularity at draft time?**  
  Draft order among them: **youngest first**.
