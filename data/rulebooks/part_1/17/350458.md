## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective
Emperor Qin Shi Huang has passed away, and players are tasked with building the Terracotta Army to guard his tomb. As craftsmen and artists, players collect resources, upgrade workers, and gain favor with Advisors. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) over five rounds by constructing statues, influencing scoring areas, and forming strategic groups. The player with the highest VP total after End Game Scoring wins.

4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of three phases:
1. Action Phase: Players take turns placing Workers on Action Wheel.
2. Scoring Phase: Score Inspectors, Musicians, and current Scoring Tile.
3. Cleanup Phase: Update turn order, flip clay, gain Master bonuses, prepare for next round.

Repeat for 5 rounds. After final Cleanup Phase, conduct End Game Scoring.

5. Core Mechanics
Workers:
- Craftsmen and Artisans are Workers.
- Place Workers on Action Wheel segments.
- Empty segment: any Worker.
- One Craftsman present: only Artisan may be added.
- Artisan present: no further placement.

Worker Placement Actions:
- Rotate Ring (Optional): Pay 2 Coins to rotate Inner Ring clockwise or Middle Ring counterclockwise by one step. Only once per turn.
- Place Worker (Mandatory): As above.
- Perform Actions (Optional): Resolve three actions from inner to outer ring:
  - Inner/Middle Ring: Perform action, take 1 Wet Clay/1 Coin, or do nothing.
  - Outer Ring: Perform action or do nothing (no compensation for skipping).

Statue Placement:
- Warriors: Pay Wet Clay (2/3/4 depending on action). Return 1 Clay (Dry side up) to matching Warehouse. Take bottom Warrior of chosen type, attach player base, place on Mausoleum, score VP, optionally activate ability using Weapon.
- Specialists: Pay Coins (1 + number of that type already built). Flip corresponding Weapon to inactive. No player base.

Warrior Abilities (optional, require active Weapon):
- Officer (Sword): Score 1 VP; may move 1 Inspector 1 space forward/backward.
- Guard (Halberd): Score 3 VP; may move 1 of your Warriors any number of empty spaces in straight line.
- Crossbowman (Crossbow): Score 1 VP per empty space between this Warrior and another Statue in same row/column (choose one direction).
- Soldier (Spear): Score 1 VP; gain 2 Coins.

Specialist Abilities:
- Horse: Occupies 3 adjacent spaces in row/column. First space must have one of your Warriors. That Warrior now occupies all 3 spaces (counts as 1 Warrior).
- Footman: End Game – score surrounding 8 spaces. Domination: 8 VP; Presence: 2 VP.
- Kneeling Archer: When placed, face it toward a Warrior. Counts as that type for grouping. Breaks ties for Domination. At End Game, player whose Warrior it faces gains 2 VP.
- Musician: Each Scoring Phase, each player scores 1 VP per their Warrior in same row/column. Multiple Musicians can score same Warrior.

Master Abilities (first use costs Coins equal to number of Masters already placed by you):
- Master Builder: Pay Coins = round number. Place Warrior of type with most remaining in Organizer. No VP, no ability activation.
- Master Administrator: Repeat Inner Ring action (pay costs again).
- Master Inspector: Move 1 Inspector 1–2 spaces forward.
- Master Clay Maker: Gain 3 Wet Clay.
- Master Supervisor: Take all Dry Clay from any 2 Warehouses.
- Master Blacksmith: Ready all Weapons (flip to active).

Cleanup Phase Bonuses (cumulative):
- Master Builder, Administrator, Inspector: Gain 1 Coin.
- Master Clay Maker, Supervisor, Blacksmith: Protect 1 Wet Clay from drying.

6. Scoring & End Game
Scoring Phase (each round):
1. Left Inspector (row): 
   - Domination: 7 VP (only player with most Warriors in row)
   - Presence: 3 VP (any player with ≥1 Warrior)
   - Kneeling Archer breaks ties.
   - Move Inspector 1 space forward.
2. Bottom Inspector (column): Same as above.
3. Musicians: Each player scores 1 VP per their Warrior in same row/column as each Musician (can score multiple times).
4. Scoring Tile: Varies by round. Domination/Presence values increase:
   - Round 1: 5/2
   - Round 2: 7/3
   - Round 3: 9/4
   - Round 4: 11/5
   - Round 5: 13/6
   Requirements vary (e.g., middle row/column, specific quarter, specific Warrior type).

End Game Scoring (after Round 5):
1. Footmen: For each, score surrounding 8 spaces:
   - Domination: 8 VP
   - Presence: 2 VP
   - Kneeling Archer breaks ties. Horse + Warrior = 1 Warrior.
2. Remove ungrouped Warriors: Remove any Warrior not in a group.
   - Group: 2+ orthogonally adjacent Warriors of same type (any players).
   - Kneeling Archer facing a Warrior of matching type counts as part of that group.
3. Score each group:
   - Each Warrior worth VP = number of different players in group.
   - If ≥2 players: Domination (5 VP), Presence (2 VP). Kneeling Archer breaks ties.
4. Kneeling Archers: Player whose Warrior it faces gains 2 VP each.
5. Leftover Resources: 1 VP per 2 total (Clay + Coins, any state).
6. Winner: Most VP. Tie: player higher in Turn Order wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- Bases: If a player runs out of bases, use suitable replacements. In 2-player, players may use two colors.
- Master Tokens: Green 3/4 tokens are double-sided (3/4). Use one side 3, other side 4. No functional impact.
- "Assistant" in rules: Refers to Craftsman (only they can be upgraded).
- Kneeling Archer: May face another player’s Warrior or empty space (no benefit).
- Multiple Kneeling Archers: Can point at same Warrior.
- Horse: Must be assigned to one of your Warriors; cannot connect to opponent’s.
- Guard ability: Cannot move Warrior off Horse; can move Horse + Warrior together if path is clear.
- Master token order: Can be bought in any order (no strategic benefit to non-sequential).
- Specialist cost reminder: Coins under Specialists on board are visual aid only; build from bottom up.
