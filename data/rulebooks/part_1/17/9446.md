## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Blue Moon is a two-player card game of tactical combat and resource management. Players represent rival Peoples vying for control of powerful Dragons. The core objective is to attract Dragons by winning fights, using a mix of strategy, bluffing, and efficient card play. The game emphasizes timing, hand management, and psychological pressure, akin to an auction where players aim to win fights at the lowest cost while forcing opponents to overcommit.

2. Components  
- A deck of cards unique to each People (player)  
- 3 Dragon tokens  
- A central play area (Combat Area)  
- Leader token for each player  

3. Setup  
- Randomly determine the starting player.  
- Place 3 Dragons in the center of the board.  
- Each player chooses a People, places their Leader on the board, shuffles their deck, and draws 6 cards to form their starting hand.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows this sequence:  
1. Beginning of Turn – usually nothing happens.  
2. Leadership – Play 1 Leadership card on top of any existing Leadership stack.  
3. Retreat from Fight? OR Decline to start a fight  
   - If in an ongoing fight, you may retreat. If you do, your opponent wins the fight.  
   - If not in a fight or choosing not to continue, you may decline to start a fight. In this case, discard up to 3 cards and refresh your hand to 6 cards.  
   - To continue a fight, you must meet or exceed your opponent’s announced power.  
4. Character – You MUST play 1 Character card to continue the fight.  
5. Booster/Support – You MAY play 1 Booster or Support card.  
6. Announce Power – Verbally declare your total power (e.g., "I have 4 Fire").  
7. Refresh Hand – Draw cards to restore your hand to 6 cards.  
8. End of Turn – usually nothing happens.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Combat Area**: Only cards in the Combat Area are active. Cards become inactive when discarded or covered (e.g., by a new Leadership card).  
- **Power Matching**: To stay in a fight, your total power must meet or exceed your opponent’s.  
- **Leadership Cards**: Played each turn; only the top Leadership card is active.  
- **Card Limits**:  
  - 1 Character card per turn (unless modified by icons).  
  - 1 Booster/Support card per turn (unless modified by icons).  
- **Special Icons** (from advanced decks):  
  - **SHIELD**: Do not need to match opponent’s power; can reduce total power in a fight.  
  - **STOP**: Cannot play additional cards this turn; proceed directly to Announce Power.  
  - **RETRIEVE**: At the Beginning of Turn, return this active card to your hand. Cannot use if opponent has a RETRIEVE card active.  
  - **PROTECTED**: Immune to opposing effects while active.  
  - **FREE**: Does not count toward the 1-card limit for Character or Booster/Support.  
  - **PAIR**: If two cards share identical first words (e.g., “Dancer of”), they can be played as one Character, combining power, icons, and abilities.  
  - **GANG (Khind People)**: Cards with matching GANG color icons may be played together as one Character. To keep the GANG active, you must add at least one more GANG card each turn.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Winning a Fight**:  
  - Winner attracts 1 Dragon.  
  - If winner has 6 or more cards in their Combat Area, they attract a second Dragon.  
  - Discard all cards from the Combat Area.  
  - Both players refresh hands to 6 cards.  
  - The retreating player (or loser) starts the next turn.  
- **Game Ends When**:  
  - A player has 3 Dragons and would attract a 4th (they win immediately).  
  - A player uses all cards in their deck and hand (finish the current fight):  
    - If all 3 Dragons are on the board, the player who runs out of cards first loses.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - Winner of a fight scores 1 Crystal plus 1 Crystal for each Dragon they attract.  
  - Optional: Play to 5 Crystals to win the game.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I play more than one Character card?  
  A: Only if a card effect or icon (like FREE or GANG) allows it. Normally, only 1 Character card may be played per turn.  
- Q: What happens if both players run out of cards simultaneously?  
  A: The fight concludes normally. If the player with fewer Dragons would attract a Dragon, they win. Otherwise, standard rules apply.  
- Q: Can I use RETRIEVE if my opponent has a RETRIEVE card that is covered?  
  A: No. If the opponent has any RETRIEVE card in their Combat Area (even if inactive/covered), you cannot use RETRIEVE.  
- Q: Does Leadership count toward the 6-card threshold for extra Dragon?  
  A: Yes. All cards in the Combat Area count, including Leadership, Character, and Support cards.  
- Q: Can I retreat after playing cards but before announcing power?  
  A: Yes. Retreat is checked before committing further cards. If you retreat, opponent wins, and you do not continue the turn sequence.
