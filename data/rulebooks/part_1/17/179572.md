## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Dice City is a competitive dice-placement and city-building game where players develop their own city by acquiring and activating location cards, growing their army, and attacking opponents or neutral targets. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VP) by constructing valuable locations, defeating bandits, deactivating opponents’ buildings, and managing resources efficiently.

### 2. Components  
- Player boards (city grids)  
- Dice (assigned to player boards)  
- Location cards (Civic, Cultural, Economic, Military) from various expansions  
- Bandits cards (3 piles)  
- Trade ship cards (3 piles)  
- Resource tokens (wood, stone, iron, gold)  
- Pass tokens  
- Deactivation tokens  
- Victory point (VP) tokens  
- Location deck(s)  

*Note: Specific quantities not provided in source.*

### 3. Setup  
- Each player receives a player board.  
- Place starting dice on player boards as per standard setup (not detailed in source).  
- Shuffle location, bandits, and trade ship decks separately.  
- Reveal a number of location cards face-up into a central display (up to 8).  
- Reveal top cards of each of the three bandits piles and three trade ship piles.  
- Place VP, resource, and pass token pools nearby.  

*Note: Exact starting conditions (e.g. initial resources or dice) not specified in source.*

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On each turn, a player follows these four steps in order:

#### 1. Dice Step  
For each die on your board (processed one at a time), choose **one** of the following actions, then remove that die from the board:

- **Use Location Ability**: Activate the ability of the location card beneath the die.  
- **Move Die**: Move another die to an adjacent space (left/right) on its own row.  
- **Refresh Display**: Discard any four cards from the location display and draw four new ones. *(Only once per turn)*  
- **Reactivate Location**: Remove a deactivation token from any location in your city (restoring its function).  
- **Pass**: Gain one pass token. *(Only once per turn)*

**Spend Pass Tokens (anytime during your turn):**  
For every **two** pass tokens spent, choose one of the following:
- Gain one resource of your choice (wood, stone, or iron; gold is not a resource).  
- Increase your army strength by +1 for the turn.  
- Force all other players to re-roll one of their dice (you choose which die, resolved clockwise).

#### 2. Attack Step  
You may perform any number of attacks in any order.

- **Attack Bandits**:  
  - Choose a revealed bandits card whose defense value is ≤ your current army strength.  
  - Take the card and add it to your play area.  
  - Gain any rewards listed on the card (typically VP or resources).

- **Attack Locations (on another player’s board)**:  
  - Choose one or more locations on a single opponent’s board.  
  - Your army strength must be ≥ the defense value of each targeted location.  
  - Place a deactivation token on each defeated location (disabling its abilities).  
  - Gain VP from the supply equal to each location’s VP value (if any).

- **Attack Stock (Resource or Gold)**:  
  - Choose another player.  
  - You must have army strength ≥ 2 to steal one resource (wood, stone, iron).  
  - You must have army strength ≥ 3 to steal one gold.  
  - Take one eligible item from their stock.

#### 3. Building and Trade Step  
- **Purchase Location Cards**:  
  - Spend resources/commodities shown on any face-up location card in the display.  
  - Place the purchased card anywhere on your city board.  
  - If a card is replaced, discard it from the game.  
  - Replenish the display from the location deck (maintain up to 8 cards).

- **Purchase Trade Ship Cards**:  
  - Spend resources shown on face-up trade ship cards.  
  - Place purchased trade ships face down in front of you (scored at game end).  

#### 4. End of Turn  
- **Reduce Stock**: Keep only **one** of each resource type (wood, stone, iron) and **one gold**. Return excess to supply.  
- **Keep Pass Tokens**: No limit—retain all pass tokens for future use.  
- **Reduce Army**: Army strength resets to zero.  
- **Roll All Dice**: Re-roll all dice and place them on your board in their starting positions.  

Play proceeds clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Dice Placement**: Dice activate locations or trigger actions based on position.  
- **Army Strength**: Temporary combat power used during Attack Step; resets each turn.  
- **Pass Tokens**: Earned by passing during Dice Step; spent in pairs for powerful effects.  
- **Deactivation**: Opponent locations can be disabled via successful attacks.  
- **Resource Management**: Strict hand limit (1 per resource/gold); efficient spending is key.  
- **City Building**: Strategic placement of location cards to optimize die use and abilities.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### End Game Triggers  
The game ends when **any one** of the following occurs:
- All cards taken from all three bandits piles.  
- All cards taken from **two** of the three trade ship piles.  
- Location deck is exhausted.  
- A player fills **two or more rows** in their city with built locations and **none are deactivated** — this player may **choose** whether to end the game.

After the trigger, play continues until all players have had an equal number of turns.

#### Final Scoring  
Add up:
- VP from defeated bandits cards.  
- VP from deactivating opponent locations.  
- VP from trade ship cards (face-down pile).  
- VP from location cards in your city (as indicated).  
- Any other VP sources (if specified on cards).

Highest total VP wins. Tiebreakers not specified.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I attack multiple players in one Attack Step?**  
  No. You may attack bandits and multiple locations on a single opponent, but "Attack Stock" and "Attack Locations" are limited to one opponent per action. You may choose different players for different attack types.

- **Can I reactivate my own location more than once?**  
  Yes, as long as you have the action and the location is deactivated.

- **Can I use a location ability more than once per turn?**  
  Yes, if multiple dice are placed on it (subject to movement rules).

- **What happens when the location display has fewer than 8 cards?**  
  Replenish immediately whenever a card is bought or discarded, up to 8, drawing from the location deck.

- **Can I spend pass tokens before using any dice?**  
  Yes. Pass token effects can be used at any time during your turn.

- **Do deactivated locations count toward filled rows?**  
  Yes. A deactivated location still occupies space. The “filled rows” end-game condition only requires that the rows are fully built (no empty spaces), regardless of deactivation status — but **none** of the locations in those rows may be deactivated.
