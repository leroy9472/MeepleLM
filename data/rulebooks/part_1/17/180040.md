## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the aftermath of war, the kingdom of Valeria lies in ruins. As a duke or duchess, your task is to rebuild civilization by constructing a thriving village around your castle. Attract adventurers, develop resources, and build structures to earn Victory Points (VP). The player who earns the most VP by the end of the game will have their village declared the new Capital City of Valeria.

### 2. Components  
- 84 Building Cards  
- 16 Adventurer Cards  
- 5 Castle Cards (one per player)  
- 5 Player Aid Cards  
- 1 Action Selection Card  
- 1 Active Player Token (grey castle piece)  
- 30 Gold Coins  

*Expansion Components (optional):*  
- Monument Cards  
- Guild Hall Cards (Buildings and Adventurers)  
- Landmark Cards and Tokens  
- Event Cards  
- Castle Grounds Tiles (Architects expansion)  
- Architect Cards (secret goals)  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Assign Players:** Each player takes one Castle card and one Player Aid card. Place the Castle face-up in front of you—this starts your Village.
2. **Gold Bank:** Form the bank based on player count:
   - 1-player: 7 coins  
   - 2-player: 14 coins  
   - 3-player: 20 coins  
   - 4-player: 25 coins  
   - 5-player: 30 coins  
   Each player receives 3 gold from the bank.
3. **Decks:** Separate cards into two decks: Buildings and Adventurers. Shuffle each deck.
4. **Deal Hands:** Deal 6 Building cards to each player (kept secret).
5. **Create Pools:**
   - **Buildings Pool:** Deal 5 face-up Building cards in a row. Place the rest face-down as a draw pile.
   - **Adventurers Pool:** Deal 5 face-up Adventurer cards above the Building row. Place the rest face-down as a draw pile.
6. **Monuments (if used):** Shuffle Monument cards into a deck. Deal 5 face-up above the Adventurer row. Remaining cards form a draw pile.
7. **Events (if used):** Set aside the top 12 Building cards. Shuffle 4 Event cards into the remaining Building deck. Place the 12 set-aside cards back on top.
8. **Landmarks (if used):** Place 5 Landmark cards face-up above the Monument row (if applicable). Place matching tokens on each. In 2-player games, remove 2 tokens from each pile.
9. **Architects (if used):** Give each player a matching Castle Grounds tile (place to the left of Castle). Shuffle Architect cards and deal one face-down to each player (keep secret).
10. **Starting Resource Phase:** In turn order, each player selects one Building card from their hand, flips it upside-down (resource side up), and slides it under their Castle. This becomes a developed Resource. Players now have one Wild Resource (from Castle) and one chosen Resource.
11. **Starting Player:** Choose any player to go first. Give them the Active Player Token and Action Selection Card.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On each turn, the Active Player follows this sequence:

1. **Replenish:** Take back all gold coins placed on your Castle and Resource cards. These coins return to your personal supply.
2. **Take One Action:** Choose and lead one of the five actions (Harvest, Develop, Build, Recruit, Tax).
3. **Follow Phase:** Other players, in clockwise order, may choose to follow the same action (using the Follow rules) or pass.
4. **End of Turn:** After all players have followed or passed, the Active Player passes the Active Player Token and Action Selection Card to the left.

*Note:* In solo play, there is no follow phase. All actions are taken as Lead actions.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions  
- **Harvest (Lead):** Draw 3 Building cards (one at a time). You may draw from any Building pile or the deck.  
  **Follow:** Draw 1 Building card.  
- **Develop (Lead):** Discard 1 Building card from hand, then develop another Building card as a Resource (place face-up, upside-down under Castle).  
  **Follow:** Discard 2 Building cards to develop one Resource.  
- **Build (Lead):** Pay the resource cost of a Building card in hand by placing gold on matching Resources (yours or others'). Add the Building to your Village (face-up, right of Castle). Then draw 1 card.  
  **Follow:** Same as Lead, but do not draw a card.  
  *Rules:* Cannot build duplicates. Gold cannot be reused. Cannot place gold on already-used Resources. Castle provides 1 Wild Resource (only usable by owner).
- **Recruit (Lead):** Pay 1 gold to the bank. Choose any face-up Adventurer who matches your current Building types (icons in upper-left). Add to your Village. Replace with top card from Adventurer deck.  
  **Follow:** Pay 2 gold to recruit.  
- **Tax (Lead):** Take 1 gold from the bank and draw 1 Building card.  
  **Follow:** Draw 1 Building card.  
  *Note:* If bank has no gold, still draw a card.

#### Drawing & Discarding  
- When drawing, choose from any of the 5 Building piles (face-up) or the face-down deck.
- When discarding (except in solo), place the card face-up on any Building pile.
- If a Building pile is emptied, immediately refill from the deck.
- Hand limit is 8 cards **after completing an action**. Excess cards must be discarded.

#### Solo Mode Adjustments  
- **Trashing replaces discarding:** Instead of placing cards on piles, remove them from the game.
- **Hand Limit:** Never exceed 8 cards at any time.
- **Develop:** Trash 1 card instead of discarding.
- **Recruit:** Pay 2 gold (no bank Follow cost difference).
- **Tax:** Trash 1 card to gain 1 gold.
- **Replenish:** Gold used on Resources stays on coin icon for one turn, then moves to resource icon (unavailable that turn). Next turn, it is reclaimed.
- **Game End:** Ends when Building deck is empty after a turn.

#### Special Powers  
- **Instant Powers (⚡):** Trigger immediately when the card is built/recruited.
- **Action-Based Powers (e.g., Build: +):** Trigger when leading or following that action. Do **not** trigger in the turn the card is built/recruited.
- **Resource Powers (e.g., Build: +Food):** Used during Build action to help pay costs. Do not require placing gold.
- **Stacking:** Multiple powers of the same type stack. Use in any order.
- **Costs:** Some powers require discarding cards or gold. Pay cost to activate.
- **Optional:** All powers are optional.
- **Opponent Interaction:** If a power lets you take from an opponent (card/gold), take from the bank instead in solo.

#### Expansions  

**Monuments**  
- **Start Construction:** When recruiting, pay +1 gold to take a Monument. Place it sideways (incomplete). Only one incomplete Monument allowed.
- **Dedicate Resources:** When developing, dedicate a Resource to the Monument instead of your Castle (no discard/trash required). These are locked and cannot be used for other builds.
- **Complete Monument:** When building, complete the Monument instead of playing a card. Discard all dedicated Resources. Pay any remaining cost with gold or powers. Draw 1 card if leading. Rotate card upright.
- **Scoring:** Score VP shown. Incomplete Monuments score nothing.

**Guild Halls**  
- Add Guild Hall Buildings and Adventurers to respective decks.
- At endgame, if a player has **more** of a specific Building type than all others (no tie), they gain bonus VP (3 VP) from the matching Guild Hall.

**Landmarks**  
- During follow phase, instead of following, a player may discard cards to claim a Landmark token:
  - Gate: Discard any 2 cards  
  - Silo: Discard a card with Food resource  
  - Statue: Discard a card with Stone resource  
  - Ward Tower: Discard a card with Magic resource  
  - Windmill: Discard a card with Wood resource  
- Tokens do not count toward game end.

**Architects**  
- Castle Grounds tile provides Wild Resource when another player places gold on it and discards a card.
- At endgame, reveal Architect card: gain 1 VP for each Building in your Village matching the types shown.

**Events**  
- Events are shuffled into the Building deck.
- When drawn, reveal and set aside. Continue the turn.
- After all actions, resolve Events in order drawn, starting with Active Player.
- Effects apply to all players as described (e.g., lose gold, discard cards, draw cards).
- Jester’s Craft: Players pass one card simultaneously to the left.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End  
The game ends after any turn in which a player reaches or exceeds the required number of Buildings and Adventurers (not including Resources, Castle, Monuments, or Landmark tokens):

- 1-player: When Building deck is empty  
- 2-player: 14 cards  
- 3-player: 12 cards  
- 4/5-player: 10 cards  

All players complete the current turn (including follow actions) before scoring.

#### Scoring  
Each player scores:
1. VP from Building and Adventurer cards (top-right number).
2. VP from special powers (e.g., Tavern: 1 VP per Adventurer).
3. 1 VP per gold coin in possession (including those on Resources and Castle).

**Expansion Scoring:**
- **Monuments:** Completed Monuments score their VP. Their Building type counts for other scoring (e.g., Harbor, Guild Halls).
- **Guild Halls:** 3 VP if you have the most of the specified Building type (no tie).
- **Landmarks:**
  - 2 VP for having the most of each token type (no tie).
  - 1 VP per Gate token.
  - 3 VP per full set of 5 different tokens.
- **Architects:** 1 VP per Building matching your secret Architect card’s types.

#### Tiebreakers  
1. Most Buildings and Adventurers  
2. Most Gold coins  
3. Most developed Resources  
4. If still tied, all tied players win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Empty Decks/Pools:** If a draw deck is empty and a pile is emptied, leave it empty. Discards still go there.
- **Empty Bank:** If you are entitled to gold but the bank is empty, you receive nothing.
- **No Valid Target for Steal:** If a power requires taking from an opponent but no opponent has gold/cards, you forfeit the benefit.
- **Hand Size During Action:** You may exceed 8 cards during an action. Discard down at the end.
- **Solo Hand Limit:** You may never draw past 8 cards.
- **Monument Requirements:** Adventurer recruitment requirements can be met using Building types from completed Monuments.
- **Resource Use:** Only one gold per Resource card at a time. Cannot reuse spent gold.
- **Event Resolution:** Resolve Events after all actions, in order drawn, starting with Active Player. Ties for "most" or "least" affect all tied players.
