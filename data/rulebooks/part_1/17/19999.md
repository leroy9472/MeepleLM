## Aton – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Each player assumes the role of a high priest—either of Aton or Amon—competing for spiritual supremacy in the four temples of Thebes. The goal is to achieve one of three victory conditions:  
- Be the first to reach 40 points.  
- Fully occupy all spaces in any one temple.  
- Fully occupy all green squares or all yellow squares across all four temples.  

Victory is immediate ("sudden death") upon achieving any of these conditions during a player’s turn. If 40 points are reached during scoring, scoring finishes and the player with the higher score wins.

---

### 2. Components  
- Game board showing four temples, each with colored and special (blue, black, bonus) squares.  
- Two player decks (red and blue), each containing cards numbered 1–4.  
- Red and blue player tokens (counters).  
- One white "exchange" counter per player.  
- Two scoring markers (one per player), used on the score track.  
- "Kingdom of the Dead" row at the bottom of the board for removed or unplaceable tokens.

---

### 3. Setup  
- Assemble the board between the two players; each player faces their side with cartouches.  
- Each player takes:  
  - A deck of cards (red or blue).  
  - Matching colored tokens.  
  - One white exchange counter.  
  - A scoring marker placed on "1" of the score track.  
- Shuffle decks and place face-down.  
- No tokens are placed on temples at start.  
- The Kingdom of the Dead is initially empty.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds. Each round consists of:  
1. **Card Draw & Assignment**: Each player draws 4 cards, selects one for each cartouche (1–4), places them face down.  
2. **Reveal & Resolve**: All 8 cards revealed simultaneously. Cartouches resolved in order (1 → 4).  
3. **Player Turns**:  
   - The player who goes first (determined by Cartouche 2) fully resolves their Cartouches 2–4.  
   - Then the second player fully resolves their Cartouches 2–4.  
4. **Discard & Refresh**: All 8 played cards discarded. Each player draws 4 new cards (reshuffle discard pile if needed).  
5. **Scoring Check**: If the Kingdom of the Dead is full, trigger scoring.  

Repeat until a win condition is met.

**Exchange Rule**: At any round’s start, after drawing cards, a player may discard their white exchange token to discard all 4 cards and draw 4 new ones. This may be done only once per game.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Cartouche 1 – Points  
- Compare card values.  
- Higher card wins: receives **2 × (difference)** in points.  
- Equal values: no points awarded.  
- Points are immediately recorded on the score track.

> Example: Player A plays 4, Player B plays 1 → difference = 3 → winner gains 6 points.

---

#### Cartouche 2 – Order of Play & Counter Removal  
Two functions:

**a) Determine Turn Order**  
- Player with **lower** Cartouche 2 card value goes first.  
- Tie: player who played **lower** card in Cartouche 1 goes first.  
- Further tie: draw cards one at a time from decks until one reveals a lower card (cards then placed at bottom of deck); that player starts.

**b) Remove Counters (Not in Round 1)**  
- Compute: **Card Value – 2**  
  - **Result > 0**: Remove that many **opponent’s** counters from temples allowed by Cartouche 3.  
  - **Result = –1 (i.e., card = 1)**: Remove **one of your own** counters from a temple allowed by Cartouche 3.  
  - **Result = 0 (i.e., card = 2)**: No removal.  
- If insufficient counters exist, remove as many as possible.  
- Removed counters go to the Kingdom of the Dead.  
- **No removal occurs in Round 1.**

> Example: Playing a 4 → remove 2 opponent’s counters. Playing a 1 → remove 1 of your own.

---

#### Cartouche 3 – Temple Access  
- The card value (1–4) determines which temples may be used for removal (Cartouche 2) and placement (Cartouche 4).  
- **All temples numbered ≤ card value** are accessible.  
  - 1 → only Temple 1  
  - 2 → Temples 1 and 2  
  - 3 → Temples 1, 2, 3  
  - 4 → All four temples

> Example: A 3 allows actions in Temples 1, 2, and 3.

---

#### Cartouche 4 – Place Counters  
- The card value indicates how many of **your own** counters you may place.  
- Counters must go on **unoccupied squares** in temples allowed by your Cartouche 3.  
- If you have no counters in supply, you cannot place any.  
- For any counter you cannot place (due to no legal space):  
  - Place it in an empty space in the **Kingdom of the Dead**.  
- Counters placed must be distributed one per square.

> Example: A 3 means you may place up to 3 counters in allowed temples.

---

#### Kingdom of the Dead  
- Holds:  
  - Counters removed during Cartouche 2.  
  - Counters that could not be placed during Cartouche 4.  
- If **all spaces in Kingdom of the Dead are filled**, trigger **Scoring Phase** immediately after the current round.  
- Any overflow tokens beyond capacity are returned to player supplies.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Scoring Trigger  
Scoring occurs **only** when the Kingdom of the Dead is full at the end of a round.

#### Scoring Breakdown  
- **Temple 1**: Player with majority receives **difference in counter counts**.  
- **Temple 2**: Majority player receives **5 points**.  
- **Temple 3**: Majority player receives **1 point per counter they have** in the temple.  
- **Temple 4**: Majority player receives **3 points per blue square they occupy** (one blue square per temple, so up to 4 blue squares total).  
- **Black Squares**: Player with majority across **all black squares** (in all temples) receives **8 points**.  
- **Bonus Squares**: Each player receives **+1 or +2 points** for each bonus square they occupy.  

> **Note**: No points awarded for Temple or Black Square if tied.

#### Post-Scoring Token Removal  
After scoring:  
- Both players remove **4 of their own counters** from the temples.  
- Players alternate removing **one counter at a time**, starting with the player **leading on score** (tie → red removes first).  
- **Must remove one counter from each temple if possible.**  
- If a player lacks counters in a temple:  
  - First remove one from each temple they **do** occupy.  
  - Then remove remaining from the temple(s) where they have the most.  
- All removed counters (from temples and Kingdom of the Dead) return to their respective supplies.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Do both players remove counters during Cartouche 2?**  
  A: Yes. Both resolve removals (or self-removals) based on their own card values. Order: lower Cartouche 2 card acts first.

- **Q: Are removals/placements simultaneous or sequential?**  
  A: Sequential. First player resolves Cartouches 2–4 completely, then second player does.

- **Q: Can I avoid removing my own counter (if required) by claiming no access?**  
  A: No. If you must remove your own counter (e.g., played 1 in Cartouche 2), you **must** do so from a temple allowed by your Cartouche 3, even if it’s inconvenient.

- **Q: What if I can’t remove one from each temple during post-scoring cleanup?**  
  A: Remove one from each temple you occupy. Then remove the rest from your most-occupied temple(s).

- **Q: Is reaching 40 points during scoring an instant win?**  
  A: No. Scoring finishes for both players. The player with the **higher total** wins. Ties are shared.

- **Q: Are victory conditions checked during play?**  
  A: Yes. If a player completes a temple, all green/yellow squares, or hits 40 via Cartouche 1, the game ends **immediately**.
