### 1. Lore & Objective

**Objective:**  
Be the player with the most prestige points (PP) at the end of the game by establishing trade routes, claiming offices in cities, improving your abilities, and fulfilling endgame scoring conditions.

**Lore:**  
Players represent Hanseatic traders competing to expand their influence across Northern Europe by securing trade routes, building offices in key cities, and enhancing their commercial skills. Prestige is earned through control of cities, network expansion, and strategic development.

### 3. Setup

#### Board Setup:
1. Choose correct board side (2–3 or 4–5 players).
2. Place 3 **gold bonus markers** randomly on the **taverns (Taberna)**, arrows pointing to routes.
3. Shuffle remaining **13 silver bonus markers** face down; place stack beside board.

#### Player Setup:
Each player receives:
- 1 player board
- 27 Traders (cubes)
- 4 Merchants (discs)

**On Player Board:**
- Cover all spaces on each track **except the leftmost**:
  - **Actiones (Actions):** cubes
  - **Privilegium (Privileges):** cubes
  - **Bursa (Money Bags):** cubes
  - **Clavis Urbis (City Keys):** cubes

### 4. Gameplay Flow

Players take turns clockwise. On a turn, a player may take **up to the number of actions** shown by the highest **uncovered number** on their **Actiones (Actions)** track.

Actions may be repeated in any order.

#### Available Actions:
1. **Take Income (Resupply)**
2. **Place Trader or Merchant**
3. **Displace Opponent’s Trader/Merchant**
4. **Move Own Traders/Merchants**
5. **Claim a Trade Route**

After each action, check for game end triggers.

**Bonus Markers** (if acquired) may be used **after the current action**, but **not during it**. Using a bonus marker **does not cost an action**.

At end of turn (if a bonus marker was claimed), draw a new one and place it on an eligible empty route.

---

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### 1. Take Income (Resupply)
- Move traders/merchants from **Stock** to **Personal Supply**.
- Amount allowed = highest revealed number on **Bursa (Bag)** track.
- “C” = take all remaining from stock.

#### 2. Place Trader or Merchant
- Place **1** from personal supply onto **any empty house** on a trade route.
- House accepts **either** cube or disc.

#### 3. Displace Opponent’s Trader/Merchant
- Replace **1 opponent’s piece** on a **route house** with your own from supply.
- **Cost:**
  - Displace **Trader (cube)**: Pay **1** piece from supply to **stock**.
  - Displace **Merchant (disc)**: Pay **2** pieces from supply to **stock**.
- **Displaced Player:**
  - Immediately places displaced piece + 1 (if trader) or 2 (if merchant) **from their stock** onto **adjacent route(s)**.
  - If no space on adjacent routes, go to next-level adjacent routes.
  - If no stock, may use **personal supply**, then **pieces on board**.

#### 4. Move Own Traders/Merchants
- Move up to **number shown on Liber Sophiae (Book)** track.
- Move from one **route house** to another **empty house**.
- May **swap** a trader and merchant (counts as **2 moves**).

#### 5. Claim a Trade Route
- You may claim **only if all houses** on a route are occupied **exclusively by your pieces**.
- Execute in this order:

##### a. Score City Control
- Each player who **controls** an adjacent city scores **1 PP**.
- **Control** = most offices in city; tie broken by **rightmost office**.
- The player claiming the route **can** be the controller.

##### b. Claim Bonus Marker
- If a bonus marker is on the route, **take it**.
- Draw a new one and place it **face down** on your board.
- At **end of turn**, place it on an **empty route** that:
  - Has **no pieces**.
  - Has **no bonus marker**.
  - Has **at least one adjacent city with an empty office**.

##### c. Choose One Reward:
You may do **only one** of the following:

**i. Establish an Office (Kontor)**
- Take **1** piece from the claimed route and place it in the **leftmost empty office** in one of the two adjacent cities.
- Must meet:
  - **Shape**: Trader → square, Merchant → circle.
  - **Privilegium**: Must have unlocked the color of the office.
- **Immediate Bonuses:**
  - If office has **gold coin**, gain **1 PP**.
  - If this office **completes the city**, advance **black cube** on Completed Cities Track.
  - If this office completes a **connected path from Arnheim to Stendal**, gain **7, 4, or 2 PP** (1st, 2nd, 3rd player to do so).

**ii. Improve an Ability (Skill Upgrade)**
- Only if the route connects to **Groningen, Stade, Lübeck, Göttingen, or Halle** (yellow banners).
- Remove the **leftmost covered piece** from the corresponding ability track on your board and add it to your **personal supply**.
- The **next space is now revealed** — ability is immediately active.
- **All route pieces** go to **stock**.

**iii. Claim Coellen Prestige Spot**
- Only if claiming **Coellen–Warburg route**.
- Use **1 Merchant** from the route to claim **any open spot** on the Coellen tableau.
- Must have the **Privilegium color** matching the spot.
- **No left-to-right restriction**.
- Awarded **at endgame scoring**.
- All other route pieces go to **stock**.

##### d. Return Remaining Pieces
- All **remaining pieces** from the route go to your **stock** (not supply).

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### End Game Triggers (game ends **immediately after** the action that triggers):
- A player reaches **20 or more PP**.
- The **10th city is completed** (black cube reaches 10).
- A player needs to draw a **bonus marker** but **none remain**.

When triggered, the current player finishes the action and loses remaining actions.

#### Final Scoring (add to current PP):
1. **Fully Developed Abilities (4 PP each):**
   - **Actiones, Privilegium, Bursa, Liber Sophiae**.
   - **Clavis Urbis (Keys)** does **not** count.

2. **Bonus Markers Collected:**
   - 1 → 1 PP
   - 2–3 → 3 PP
   - 4–5 → 6 PP
   - 6–7 → 10 PP
   - 8–9 → 15 PP
   - 10+ → 21 PP  
   *(Includes both used and unused markers.)*

3. **Coellen Tableau:**
   - Score points shown on spaces where you placed Merchants (e.g., 7, 8, 9, 11).

4. **Controlled Cities:**
   - 2 PP for **each city you control**.
   - Control = most offices; tie → rightmost office.

5. **Largest Network:**
   - Find your **largest connected group of cities** where you have **at least one office**.
   - Count **total number of your offices (pieces)** in this network.
   - Multiply by your **highest revealed City Key** value.
   - Example: 8 offices × Key value 3 = 24 PP.

**Winning:** Highest total PP wins. **Tie:** All tied players win.
