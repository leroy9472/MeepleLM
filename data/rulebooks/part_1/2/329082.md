### 3. Setup  
1. **Camp Selection**:  
   - Each player draws 6 camp cards and selects 3 to place face-down in a row in their play area.  
   - *Recommended First Game*:  
     - Experienced player: Arcade, Victory Totem, Mercenary Camp  
     - New player: Garage, Railgun, Supply Depot  
   - Flip all selected camps face-up. Return unselected camps to the box.  

2. **Player Setup (per player)**:  
   - Place Water Silo and Raiders cards face-up in play area.  
   - Form a supply of 3 white water discs.  
   - Draw initial hand: total cards equal to the sum of the black rectangle values on your 3 camps.  
   - Take a player aid card.

3. **Shared Setup**:  
   - Shuffle draw deck and place centrally with space for a discard pile.  
   - Place black extra water discs in center supply.

4. **Determine First Player**:  
   - Flip a water disc. If it lands “water side up”, you start. Otherwise, opponent starts.  
   - *First Turn Exception*: Start player collects only 1 water in Replenish phase (not 3).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has three phases:

#### 1. EVENTS

- Advance all remaining events in your queue one space forward (toward opponent).

#### 2. REPLENISH  
- Draw 1 card from the draw deck.  
- Collect 3 white water discs for use this turn.  
  - *Exception*: Start player collects only 1 water on first turn.

#### 3. ACTIONS

- **Play Card** (Person or Event)  
- **Draw Card** (spend 2 water)  
- **Junk Card** (discard for instant effect)  
- **Take Water Silo** (spend 1 water)  
- **Use Ability** (on ready cards)

**End of Turn Cleanup**:  
- Return all water and extra water discs to their supplies.  
- Flip all used cards (if marked “not ready”) back to ready state.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Play Area  
- **Columns**: Each camp forms a column with space for up to 2 people in front.  
- **Event Queue**: 3 spaces (③\*, ②\*, ①\*) — events advance one space per turn.  
- **Unprotected**: A card (person or camp) is unprotected if no friendly card is in front of it.

#### Card Types  
**Camps (Black Border)**  
- Provide initial hand size (black rectangle value).  
- May have abilities and traits in green brackets [ ].  
- Destroyed camps flip to destroyed side.

**People (White Border)**  
- Cost ⑥ to play.  
- Have a junk effect ① and optional abilities ⑨.  
- May have [traits] active when not damaged.

**Events (Yellow-Black Striped Border)**  
- Cost ⑥ to play.  
- Placed in event queue based on bomb icon (③\*, ②\*, ①\*).  
- ⑥\* events resolve immediately.  
- Only one event per queue space.

**Punks**  
- Represented by facedown card from top of draw deck.  
- No abilities.  
- Destroyed when damaged. Returned facedown to top of draw deck.

#### Actions Explained  
**Play Card (Person)**  
- Spend water equal to cost.  
- Place in any column (even with destroyed camp).  
- If column has 1 person, place new person in front or behind.  
- Max 2 people per column.  
- If no space, destroy one of your people first.

**Play Card (Event)**  
- Place in queue space matching its bomb icon.  
- If occupied, place in next available space behind (up to ③\*).  
- ⑥\* events resolve immediately.

**Draw Card**  
- Spend 2 water to draw 1 card.

**Junk Card**  
- Discard any card from hand for its junk effect (e.g., Injure, Draw, Extra Water).  
- *Water Silo*: When junked, return to play area (not discard).

**Take Water Silo**  
- Spend 1 water to move Water Silo card from play to hand.  
- Can be kept in hand across turns.

**Use Ability**  
- Card must be **ready**.  
- Spend water equal to ability cost.  
- Resolve all text and icons.  
- After use, card becomes **not ready**.  
- Zero-cost abilities: Mark with extra water disc (pink dash side).

#### Ready Status  
A card is **not ready** if:
- It was played this turn.  
- It was restored this turn.  
- One of its abilities was used this turn.  
- It is damaged (turned sideways).  
- It has water on it (unless trait/ability says otherwise).

Camps are always ready unless an ability was used this turn.

#### Damage & Destroy  
- **Damage**: Turn card sideways.  
- **Destroy**:  
  - Person → discard  
  - Camp → flip to destroyed side  
  - Punk → return facedown to top of draw deck  
- Second damage destroys (except punks, destroyed on first damage).

#### Key Icons  
- **Injure**: Damage a person.  
- **Restore**: Rotate your damaged card upright; mark as not ready.  
- **Draw**: Draw 1 card.  
- **Extra Water**: Gain 1 black extra water disc (return at turn end).  
- **Raid**: Advance or play Raiders event.  
- **Gain Punk**: Place top card of deck facedown in any column (counts as person).  
- **Destroy**: Discard or flip as appropriate.

#### Special Rules  
- **No Hand Limit**  
- **No Peeking**: Cannot look at punk identity.  
- **No Dumpster Diving**: Cannot search discard pile.  
- **Enemy** = opponent’s people, not camps.  
- **Protection**: Only unprotected cards can be damaged, unless ability says “any”, “all”, or “one of”.
