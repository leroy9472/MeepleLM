## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
The game simulates early American railroad development. Players act as railroad barons financing their companies, building track networks, and transporting goods to earn income and victory points (VP). The goal is to maximize VP by the end of the game.

2. **Components**  
- Game board (e.g., Rust Belt map)  
- Track tiles: simple, complex (coexisting and crossing), dedicated town tiles  
- 8 New City tiles  
- 180 Track Ownership disks (30 per player in 6 colors)  
- 110 Goods cubes (20 red, 20 blue, 20 purple, 20 yellow, 16 black, 14 white)  
- Money: chips in $1, $5, and $25 denominations  
- 6 dice  
- Turn Track marker  
- 8 white Town disks  
- Display boards: Goods Display, Income Track, Engine Track, Issued Shares Track, Player Order Track

3. **Setup**  
- Place the board and position the Turn Track marker on "Start."  
- Fill the Goods Display: Randomly draw 52 cubes and place them row by row.  
- Place starting goods:  
  - Pittsburgh and Wheeling: 3 random cubes each  
  - All other cities: 2 random cubes each  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 25 player disks (20 for track ownership, 5 for markers)  
  - Places 1 disk each on:  
    - Engine Track "1"  
    - Income Track "0"  
    - Issued Shares Track "2"  
  - Receives $10 in cash (1 × $5, 5 × $1)  
- Determine initial player order: Each player rolls 3 dice; order is set from highest to lowest sum.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Each turn follows this sequence:  
1. **Issue Shares**  
2. **Determine Player Order**  
3. **Select Actions**  
4. **Build Track**  
5. **Move Goods**  
6. **Collect Income**  
7. **Pay Expenses**  
8. **Income Reduction**  
9. **Goods Growth**  
10. **Advance Turn Marker**

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Issue Shares**: Players may issue shares (each gives $5), moving their marker on the Issued Shares Track. No limit specified, but used for financing.  
- **Determine Player Order**: Auction-based bidding. Starting with the previous first player, each player may raise the bid or drop out.  
  - First to drop: pays $0, takes last place  
  - Last two remaining: pay full bid  
  - Others: pay half bid (rounded up)  
  - Turn Order action allows one "pass" without dropping out.  
- **Select Actions**: Seven unique actions; one per player per turn:  
  - *First Move*: Move goods first in both rounds  
  - *First Build*: Build track before others  
  - *Engineer*: Build/replace up to 4 tiles  
  - *Locomotive*: Immediately increase Engine Track by 1 (max 6)  
  - *Urbanization*: Place a New City tile on a Town hex before building  
  - *Production*: Draw 2 random cubes and place them on empty Goods Display slots  
  - *Turn Order*: Allows one "pass" in next auction  
- **Build Track**:  
  - Players build in player order (unless First Build is taken)  
  - May build/replace up to 3 tiles (4 if Engineer)  
  - First tile must connect to a city via simple track  
  - All future track must trace back to a city  
  - Cannot connect directly to another player's track  
  - Cannot build on cities or off-map areas  
  - *Completed Link*: Connects two cities/towns; ownership permanent  
  - *Unfinished Section*: Not fully connected; ownership lost if not extended next turn  
  - *Town*: Must place white disk on non-dedicated tiles  
  - *Urbanization*: Remove existing tile, place New City; any adjacent unowned track becomes claimable  
- **Track Costs**:  
  - *Placing*:  
    - Simple: $2 (base), +$1 river, +$2 mountain  
    - Complex Coexist: +$1 over simple  
    - Complex Crossing: +$2 over simple  
    - Town: $1 + $1 per track entering  
  - *Replacing*:  
    - Simple → Crossing: $3  
    - In a Town: $3  
    - All others: $2  
  - *Redirecting*: $2 (end of unfinished section only)  
- **Move Goods**:  
  - Two rounds; each player moves one cube per round  
  - May skip one move to increase Engine Track by 1  
  - Cube must end in city of matching color; stops at first such city  
  - Cannot visit same city/town twice  
  - Movement limited by Engine level  
  - Each link traversed increases owner’s Income Track by 1  
  - First Move action allows moving first in both rounds  
- **Collect Income**: Receive cash equal to Income Track value  
- **Pay Expenses**: Pay $1 per issued share + $1 per Engine level  
  - If insufficient cash, reduce Income by amount owed  
  - Income ≤ 0: player eliminated  
- **Income Reduction**: Reduce Income based on current level:  
  - ≥ $51: –10  
  - $41–50: –8  
  - $31–40: –6  
  - $21–30: –4  
  - $11–20: –2  
- **Goods Growth**:  
  - Production action: Add 2 cubes to empty Goods Display slots  
  - Roll one die per player  
  - For each die, take top cube from column matching die roll and place on corresponding city  
  - Left (light) side first, then right (dark) side  
  - New Cities (A–D, G–H) receive cubes if corresponding number is rolled and city is on board  
- **Advance Turn Marker**: Move marker; game ends after final turn (6–10 turns based on player count)

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- Game ends after final turn (varies by player count)  
- Final scoring:  
  - 3 VP per $1 of final Income  
  - 1 VP per track segment in Completed Links (each tile and each town exit counts as a segment)  
  - –3 VP per issued share  
- Total VP = (Income × 3) + (Completed Track Segments) – (Shares × 3)  
- Highest score wins; ties possible

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can track be disconnected?** Yes; networks need not be contiguous  
- **Can you use another player’s track?** Yes; but they gain income for each link used  
- **What happens to unowned unfinished track?** Next player to extend it may claim ownership  
- **Can you redirect any tile?** Only the last tile of an unfinished section you own or is unowned  
- **Urbanization and track ownership**: Existing unowned or opponent’s track adjacent to newly urbanized city may be claimed if extended  
- **Ties**: Possible; no official tiebreaker in base game
