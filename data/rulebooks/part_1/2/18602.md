## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In Caylus, players are master builders striving to develop the medieval village of Caylus into a grand city under King Phillip. The objective is to score the most prestige points (victory points) by constructing buildings, contributing to the castle’s construction, and leveraging royal favors. The game progresses through three phases—Dungeon, Walls, and Towers—each ending in scoring. The player with the highest score after the Tower phase wins.

### 2. Components
- Game board with road, bridge, castle track, and turn order/passing scale
- Bailiff and Provost pawns
- Player sets: workers, colored houses, score marker, turn order marker
- Building tiles: Neutral (pink), Wood (brown), Stone (gray), Residential (green), Prestige (blue)
- Resource cubes: food, wood, stone, cloth, gold
- Deniers (money): 1 and 5 value coins
- Royal Favor track with 4 rows (Prestige, Money, Resources, Buildings)

### 3. Setup
- Place the 6 randomly drawn pink (neutral) buildings on the road spaces immediately after the bridge.
- Each player chooses a color and takes matching workers, houses, markers, and disks.
- Place one marker on the turn order track, one on the passing scale (bridge), one on score track at 0, and one on each of the 4 Royal Favor tracks.
- Randomize turn order: 1st player gets 5 deniers, 2nd/3rd get 6, 4th/5th get 7. Each player also receives 1 wood and 2 food cubes.
- Place Bailiff and Provost on the last pink building tile.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game turn consists of 7 phases:
1. **Income**: All players collect deniers.
2. **Place Workers**: Players take turns placing workers or passing.
3. **Activate Special Buildings**: Resolve the 6 pre-bridge buildings in order.
4. **Move Provost**: Players move Provost 1–3 spaces, paying 1 denier per space, in passing order.
5. **Activate Buildings**: Activate buildings from bridge to Provost’s position.
6. **Build Castle**: Players who placed workers contribute batches to castle construction.
7. **End of Turn**: Move Bailiff, possibly trigger scoring, and reset.

The game is divided into three phases: Dungeon (6 parts), Walls (10 parts), and Towers (14 parts). Each phase ends when:
- The Bailiff reaches or passes the phase’s scoring space, or
- The section is fully built.

After each phase ends, scoring occurs, and the next phase begins. The game ends after Tower scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Worker Placement (Phase 2)
- Players place workers one at a time in turn order until all pass.
- Cost to place:
  - On special/neutral/fixed buildings: equal to lowest unoccupied number on passing scale.
  - On own building: flat 1 denier.
  - On another player’s building: passing scale cost; owner gains 1 prestige point immediately.
  - On Castle: passing scale cost; worker placed on lowest-numbered castle space.
- Passing:
  - Move marker to next available passing scale space.
  - First to pass gains 1 denier.
- Inn:
  - Left space: place worker to displace right-side worker.
  - Right space: owner pays only 1 denier to place workers for the rest of the round.
- Stables: up to 3 workers total; only one per player.

#### Special Buildings (Phase 3)
In order from Gate to Inn:
- **Gate**: Move worker to any unoccupied building or take back.
- **Trading Post**: Gain 3 deniers.
- **Merchant’s Guild**: Move Provost 1–3 spaces freely.
- **Joust Field**: Pay 1 denier + 1 cloth to gain 1 Royal Favor.
- **Stables**: Change turn order based on worker positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
- **Inn**: Move left worker to right; displaced worker returns. If no new worker, right-side owner may keep or recall.

#### Provost Movement (Phase 4)
- In passing order, each player may move Provost 1–3 spaces forward/backward, paying 1 denier per space.
- Provost cannot move before first building or off road.
- Can occupy empty spaces.
- After all moves, Provost determines which buildings activate.

#### Building Activation (Phase 5)
- Activate buildings from first post-bridge to Provost’s position.
- Workers beyond Provost return without effect.
- Each building activated once per turn.
- Types:
  - **Production**: Gain resources (e.g., Farm, Quarry).
  - **Construction**:
    - Carpenter: build Wood (brown) buildings.
    - Mason: build Stone (gray) buildings.
    - Architect: build Prestige (blue) on owned Residential (green).
  - **Lawyer**: convert a neutral (pink) or own brown/gray building to Residential (green). Pay 1 denier + 1 cloth. Gain 2 prestige. Original building returns to pool (pink discarded).
  - **Marketplace**: sell 1 resource for deniers.
  - **Peddler**: buy 1 or 2 resources (non-gold) for deniers.
  - **Church**: pay 2 deniers for 3 prestige or 4 for 5.
  - **Tailor**: pay 2 cloth for 4 prestige or 3 for 6.
  - **Bank**: pay 2 deniers for 1 gold or 5 for 2.
  - **Alchemist**: pay 2 resources for 1 gold or 4 for 2.
- Stone building activated by non-owner: owner gains 1 resource (same type produced).

#### Castle Building (Phase 6)
- Players with workers on castle track build in worker order.
- To build: pay 1 batch = 3 different resources, one of which must be food.
- Each batch = 1 house in current section (Dungeon → Walls → Towers).
- If current section full, start next section.
- Scoring:
  - Dungeon: 5 VP per batch
  - Walls: 4 VP per batch
  - Towers: 3 VP per batch
- If player places worker but cannot build (lack of resources): lose 2 VP. Exception: if Towers full, no penalty.
- Player who builds most houses this round gains 1 Royal Favor (tie: earlier placement wins).

#### End of Turn (Phase 7)
- Move Bailiff:
  - If Provost is ahead: move Bailiff 2 spaces.
  - If Provost is same or behind: move Bailiff 1 space.
- Move Provost to Bailiff’s space.
- Trigger scoring if:
  - Bailiff reaches/passes phase’s scoring space, or
  - Phase section is fully built.
- Scoring occurs immediately after turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Phase Scoring
After each phase, in turn order:
- **Dungeon**:
  - 0 houses: -2 VP
  - 2+ houses: gain 1 Royal Favor
- **Walls**:
  - 0 houses: -3 VP
  - 2 houses: 1 Royal Favor
  - 3–4: 2 Royal Favors
  - 5+: 3 Royal Favors
- **Towers**:
  - 0 houses: -4 VP
  - 2–3: 1 Royal Favor
  - 4–5: 2 Royal Favors
  - 6+: 3 Royal Favors

After scoring, proceed to next phase. Game ends after Tower scoring.

#### Final Scoring
After Tower scoring:
- 3 VP per gold cube
- 1 VP per 3 non-gold cubes (round down)
- 1 VP per 4 deniers (round down)
- Highest total wins. Ties allowed.

4. **Buildings**:
   - no effect
   - build wood building with -1 wood

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Provost movement**: Cannot go before first building or off road. Can occupy empty spaces.
- **Building construction**: Only one building per activation. Cannot build on pre-printed fixed buildings (Peddler, Carpenter, Gold Mine).
- **Castle building**: Cannot skip to next section until current phase is scored. Exception: if full, may start next.
- **Royal Favors**: Cannot reuse same row in one phase. Gains during same phase (e.g., scoring + building) count as one phase.
- **Two-player rules**:
  - Start with 5 deniers each (no extra).
  - Turn order alternates each round; Stables not used.
  - After pass, remaining player pays 3 deniers per placement (instead of 2).
- **Unlimited resources**: Cubes and houses are unlimited.
