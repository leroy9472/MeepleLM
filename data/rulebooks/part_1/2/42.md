### 1. Lore & Objective
**Lore:**  
Set in ancient Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, players guide their dynasties through the dawn of civilization. Kingdoms rise and fall as players expand settlements, build temples, cultivate farms, and grow markets, all while vying for dominance through monuments and conflicts.

**Objective:**  
Develop a balanced civilization across four spheres: settlements (black), temples (red), farms (blue), and markets (green). Victory is determined by the player with the highest score in their weakest color of victory points (VPs). Treasures act as wild VPs and can be allocated freely.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Kingdoms
- A **region** is orthogonally connected tiles (no leader).
- A **kingdom** is a region containing at least one leader.
- Kingdoms grow by adding tiles or leaders. They can merge or split.

#### Leader Placement
- Leaders must be placed on **empty, non-river** spaces.
- Must be **adjacent to at least one temple**.
- **Cannot join two kingdoms** (but can connect a kingdom to stray tiles).
- If last adjacent temple is removed or flipped, leader is returned to owner.

#### Tile Placement
- **Farms (blue)** may **only** be placed on **river spaces**.
- **Settlements, temples, markets** may **not** be placed on rivers.
- A tile may **not join more than two kingdoms**.
- **Victory Points (VP):**
  - If tile is placed in a kingdom:
    - If matching-color leader is present, that player gains 1 VP in tile’s color.
    - Else, if a king is present, king’s owner gains 1 VP in tile’s color.
  - **No VP is awarded** if the tile joins two kingdoms.

#### Conflicts
Occur when a kingdom contains **two leaders of the same color**.

**Internal Conflict (Revolt):**
- Triggered by **placing a leader** into a kingdom with same-color leader.
- **Attacker:** player placing leader.
- **Defender:** owner of existing leader.
- **Strength:** number of **temples adjacent** to leader + extra temples from hand.
- **Resolution:**
  - Attacker adds first, then defender.
  - Higher total wins; **defender wins ties**.
- **Consequences:**
  - Loser **withdraws** their leader.
  - Winner gains **1 red VP** (amulet).
  - Extra temples are discarded.

**External Conflict (War):**
- Triggered by **placing a tile** that **joins two kingdoms**, creating same-color leader conflict.
- **Unification tile** is placed on joining tile.
- **Attacker:** active player if involved; else, next clockwise player with involved leader.
- **Defender:** other player in conflict.
- **Strength:** number of **supporters** (tiles of leader’s color in original kingdom) + extra tiles from hand.
- **Resolution:**
  - Attacker adds first, then defender.
  - Higher total wins; **defender wins ties**.
- **Consequences:**
  - Loser **withdraws leader and removes all supporters** from original kingdom.
  - Winner gains **1 VP per removed tile and leader** (in matching color).
  - Extra tiles and removed tiles are discarded.
  - **Exception (Priests):** Temples with **treasures** or **adjacent to another leader** are **not removed** and do **not** grant VPs.
- Resolve conflicts one at a time. Active player chooses order. Remove unification tile only when no conflicts remain.

#### Monuments
- Built when a tile completes a **2×2 square of same-colored tiles**.
- **Conditions:**
  - Must be built **during the same action**.
  - **Conflict must be resolved first** if triggered.
  - A monument with **one matching color** must be available.
- **Process:**
  - Flip four tiles face-down.
  - Place monument on top.
- **Effects:**
  - Face-down tiles still count for connectivity but **no longer count as supporters** or for leader adjacency.
  - If leader loses last adjacent temple, it is withdrawn.
  - Treasures on temples remain.
  - Monuments are **permanent**.
- **Scoring:**
  - At **end of active player’s turn**, for each of their leaders, gain **1 VP per matching-color monument** in the same kingdom.
  - King only scores from **black monuments**.

#### Treasures
- If a kingdom contains **>1 treasure** at the end of an action:
  - Owner of **trader (green leader)** in that kingdom takes **all but one** treasure.
  - On standard board: **corner temple treasures must be taken first**.
  - On advanced board: **treasures on special border spaces must be taken first**.
- If no trader, treasures remain.
- Each treasure is a **wild VP**; allocated at end of game.

#### Catastrophe Tiles
- Can be placed on **empty space** or **existing tile** (which is removed).
- **Cannot be placed on:**
  - Leader
  - Tile with treasure
  - Monument
- **Effects:**
  - Space is **permanently blocked**.
  - Breaks connections.
  - If last adjacent temple to leader is destroyed, leader is withdrawn.

#### Tile Swap
- Discard any number (≤6) of tiles from hand; draw same number from bag.
- New tiles can be used in second action.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Game Ends** at the end of any player’s turn if:
- Only **1 or 2 treasures** remain on the board, **or**
- A player **cannot replenish** their hand to 6 tiles (bag empty).

**Final Scoring:**
1. Players reveal all VPs.
2. Allocate treasures as wild VPs to any color.
3. For each player, identify **lowest VP count** among the four colors — this is their **score**.
4. **Winner** is player with **highest score**.
5. **Tiebreaker:** Compare second-lowest, then third-lowest, then fourth-lowest.
