# Hadrian's Wall – Comprehensive Reference Manual (1–2 Players)

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Hadrian’s Wall*, players take on the role of Roman generals tasked with constructing and defending a milecastle along Hadrian’s Wall in 122 AD. Over six years (rounds), players develop their fort, manage resources, train soldiers, and defend against Pict attacks. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) through Attributes (Renown, Piety, Valour, Discipline), Path Cards, and strategic development—while minimizing Disdain.

Victory is determined by final scoring after Year 6. In solo play, the player competes against a target score based on difficulty. In 2-player games, the highest score wins. Ties are broken by least Disdain, then most Path Card points, then shared victory.

#### Actions Phase:
Players take actions simultaneously until out of usable Workers/Resources.

Key actions include:
- **Mining & Foresting**: Return 1 Servant → gain 1 Resource + increase Resource Production

#### End of Year:

     - Temple Favors: any Cohort
     - Diplomat Favors: only assigned Cohort
4. **Scoring Defense**:
   - Success (all attacks blocked): gain Valour = grey flag value (Year-based)
   - Failure: gain 1 Disdain per unblocked attack (up to grey flag)
   - Partial failure: gain Disdain for unblocked attacks, Valour for difference
5. **Neutral Deck Interaction (1–2 Players)**:
   - After revealing 2 (1-player) or 1 (2-player) Neutral Prospect Cards
   - If used for Trade or Scouting, place paid Resource/Soldier on card
   - At end of Year, reveal **1 extra Fate Card per Resource/Soldier** on Neutral Cards
   - Return components and discard Neutral Cards

#### Solo AI Turn (after player actions):
1. **AI Advances Resource/Attribute Tracks**:
   - Look at top face-up Fate Card
   - For each resource icon (left to right), mark one space on AI’s track (choose which of two tracks)
   - Must fill left to right
   - Earn bonuses:
     - Attribute icon → fill next on that track
     - Cohort icon → fill next Cohort box in weakest section (tie: leftmost)
     - Remove Disdain → fill one Disdain circle (if none, lost)
     - Wall Level (W) → player must immediately fill one Wall Level square
2. **Sabotage Wall Levels**:
   - Player chooses 2 of 3 shapes from current Prospect Cards
   - Draw shapes into AI’s Wall Levels section:
     - Start at bottom
     - Subsequent shapes must orthogonally touch previous
     - If shape can’t fit, forfeit
3. **Picts Attack**:
   - Resolve as normal (AI and player defend)
