### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round follows 5 phases:
1. **Round Setup** – Stock board locations.
2. **Worker Placement** – Players place workers one at a time in turn order.
3. **Assign Viking Warriors** – Assign dice and food to combat locations.
4. **Combat Resolution** – Resolve hunting, Troll, Draugr, Bergrisar, and Monster fights.
5. **Clean-Up** – Retrieve workers, refresh board, advance round.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Worker Placement**
- Players take turns placing one worker on an available space.
- Brown/Blue locations: resolve immediately.
- Red locations: reserve for combat; resolve later.
- Public Longships: pay coin and place ship (immediate), then assign warriors (later).
- If unable or unwilling to place, "beg": lay worker down, gain 1 Food and 1 Blame.

**Combat Locations**
- **Troll/Draugr/Bergrisar**: Assign warriors to fight revealed enemies.
- **Longships**: Assign warriors and food to journey to Distant Shores.
- **Hunting Grounds**: Unassigned warriors hunt for food.

**Assigning Viking Warriors**
- Simultaneously assign dice to red locations.
- Longships require food: 1 Food per 2 warriors (left two shores), 1 Food per warrior (right two shores).
- Excess food is discarded.
- Warriors not assigned elsewhere hunt if worker is on Hunting Grounds.

**Combat Resolution Order**
1. **Hunting Grounds**: Roll all unassigned dice. Gain 1 Food per hit, max 6. Favour Tokens can reroll.
2. **Troll Fight**: Only one player can fight. If defeated, gain Glory, 1 Wood, discard 1 Blame, assign 1 Blame to another player. If not defeated, all players gain 1 Blame.
3. **Draugr Fights**: Resolve left to right. Only players with workers fight.
4. **Bergrisar Fights**: Reveal Land Journey Card first, resolve effect (e.g., pay coins), then fight.
5. **Distant Shores**: Left to right. Reveal Journey Card, feed warriors, then fight Monster.

**Combat Details**
- Roll all committed dice.
- Optionally spend Favour Tokens to reroll any/all dice.
- Deal 1 damage per weapon symbol (some dice show 2).
- Take damage: discard dice equal to enemy’s Attack Value, reduced by number of Shields rolled.
- Berserker dice must be sacrificed first if applicable.
- Combat continues until enemy is defeated or all warriors are dead.
- If enemy is defeated, claim card and reward. Surviving dice return to player.
- If warriors are defeated, remove damage from enemy; no reward.

**Sacrifice & Valhalla Mechanics**
- When a non-Leader die is returned to supply, gain a Sacrifice Token of matching color.
- After resolving any combat location, spend Sacrifice Tokens at Valhalla:
  - 2 Sacrifice Tokens → 1 Glory
  - 3 Sacrifice Tokens → 1 Viking Warrior die of choice
  - Purchase Valkyrie Blessing Cards (Instant or Permanent)
  - Defeat an Epic Monster
- Valkyrie Blessing Cards refresh after purchases; Epic Monsters do not.
- Leader Ability: Roll a helmet on Leader Die to activate secondary ability.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

1. **Destiny Cards**: Full Glory if only player fulfilling condition; half if tied.

8. **Epic Monsters**: Additional end-game Glory as specified.
