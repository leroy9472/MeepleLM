### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Unfulfilled Demand
- If a player cannot fulfill a requirement (discard resource, decrease level, etc.), they take 1 Wound per missing unit.
- If effect applies to all players (e.g., Weather), each player takes 1 Wound per Unfulfilled Demand.

#### Determination Tokens
- Gained from Morale, Rest, successful actions, skills.
- Spent to activate character skills or re-roll dice.
- Cannot be shared.
- Gained during a phase can be used immediately.

#### Wounds and Morale
- Each Wound moves marker right on life track.
- Passing a Morale decrease symbol (▽) lowers Morale by 1.
- Healing does not raise Morale.
- 2 Wounds = death = game loss.

#### Adventure Dice
Each action has 3 dice:
- **Wound Die (🩸):** Take 1 Wound on 🩸.
- **Success Die (✓):** Action succeeds on ✓; on ④, gain 2 Determination.
- **Adventure Die (?):** Draw and resolve Adventure card on ?.

#### Friday
- Not a player; controlled by First Player.
- Can act alone or support.
- Does not eat, need shelter, or suffer Weather.
- On ? roll, takes 1 Wound instead of drawing Adventure card.
- Can spend 2 Determination to re-roll any die.

#### Dog
- Only for Exploration or Hunting.
- Supports player pawns; cannot act alone.
- Cannot be used with Friday.

#### Discovery Tokens
- Gained during Exploration.
- Some provide immediate resources; others are abilities.
- Examples:
  - +1 Palisade, +1 Weapon
  - Heal 2 Wounds (with Pot)
  - Draw Treasure
  - +1 food/wood source
