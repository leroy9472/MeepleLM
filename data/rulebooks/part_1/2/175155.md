## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In Forbidden Stars, players take on the roles of rival factions in the Warhammer 40K universe, each seeking to recover lost relics critical to their survival. The goal is to gather a number of Objective tokens equal to the number of players in the game to win. If no player achieves this by the end of Round 8, the player with the most Objective tokens wins.

### 2. Components
- 1 Faction Sheet per player
- Faction-specific tokens (Objective, Structure Control, Reinforcement, Cache, Forge)
- 8 Order Tokens per player (2 of each: Deploy, Strategize, Dominate, Advance)
- Materiel Dial (set to 6 at start)
- System Tiles (1 with faction icon, others neutral)
- Event Deck (shuffled)
- Combat Deck (10 faction-specific cards, shuffled)
- Upgrade Decks: Order Upgrades and Combat Upgrades (face-up)
- Plastic Units (ground and ships)
- Warp Storm tokens
- Round Track and Round Marker
- Dice and Combat Tokens

### 3. Setup
1. Each player:
   - Selects a faction and takes its components.
   - Sets Materiel Dial to 6.
   - Takes Initial Forces from faction sheet and places them on the sheet.
2. Board Construction:
   - Each player takes the System Tile with their faction icon.
   - First player shuffles neutral tiles and deals 2 to each player.
   - Starting with first player (clockwise), each:
     a. Places one System Tile adjacent to an existing tile.
     b. Places any of their Initial Forces on the placed tile.
     c. Places one opponent Objective token per Objective space on the tile, obeying:
        - No two tokens from the same faction on one tile.
        - Cannot place a faction’s token if you hold more of another faction’s tokens.
     d. Repeat until all tiles and units are placed.
   - Board size limits: 2P: 3×2, 3P: 3×3, 4P: 3×4.
3. Warp Storms:
   - Starting with last tile placer and going reverse order, each player places one Warp Storm on any tile edge (including board edge).
4. Decks:
   - Shuffle Event cards and place face-down.
   - Shuffle 10 faction Combat cards into Combat Deck (face-down).
   - Place Upgrade decks (Order and Combat) face-up nearby.
5. Place Round Marker on Round 1.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of three phases:
1. **Planning Phase**: Players place 4 Order tokens face-down on system tiles (one per turn, clockwise), hidden and stacked. Cannot place in systems without own unit/structure in or adjacent to it.
2. **Operations Phase**: Players take turns revealing and resolving one of their top-order tokens (clockwise). May choose to resolve or place token on Event deck for later draw. Skip turn if no token on top of any stack.
3. **Refresh Phase**: All players simultaneously:
   - Collect Objectives from friendly worlds.
   - Gain Materiel from friendly worlds (max 14).
   - Rally routed units.
   - Draw Event cards (1 per token on Event deck), then in turn order: move Warp Storm, optionally resolve Event.
   - Pass First Player token and advance Round Marker. Game ends after Round 8.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Orders (Active System = tile where order is resolved)

**Deploy Order**
1. **Purchase Units**:
   - Requires Factory in active system.
   - Spend Materiel (and Forge token if required).
   - Units must meet Command Level (CL = number of cities you control). 1 Forge token may reduce CL requirement by 1 per unit.
   - Place ground units on worlds, ships on voids.
   - Max units purchasable = Deploy Limit = sum of skull icons (Unit Capacity) on all friendly worlds in active system with a Factory.
2. **Purchase Structure**:
   - Spend Materiel to buy 1 structure (City, Bastion, Factory).
   - Place on any friendly world without existing structure.
   - Structures do not count toward Unit Capacity.

**Dominate Order**
1. **Gain Assets**:
   - Gain all assets from each friendly world in active system.
   - Asset types:
     - **Forge**: Spend to reduce CL by 1 when buying a unit (1 per unit).
     - **Cache**: Spend to reduce Materiel cost by 2 when buying unit/structure (1 per purchase).
     - **Reinforcement**: Use in combat as Command Level 0 unit (ground or ship).
     - **Prosperity**: Gain 1 asset token of your choice.
   - Max 3 of each asset token.
2. **Resolve Faction Ability**:
   - May use special ability on faction sheet (e.g., Chaos may move a Cultist).

**Strategize Order**
- Requires at least one unit/structure in active system.
- Purchase 1 Order Upgrade and/or 1 Combat Upgrade.
- Pay Materiel cost; must meet CL requirement.
- **Order Upgrades**: Place face-up next to faction sheet; enhance future orders.
- **Combat Upgrades**: Take both copies; add to Combat Deck. Remove any pair from Combat Deck. Shuffle deck. (Deck remains 10 cards.)
- After resolving, place Strategize token on Event deck.

**Advance Order**
1. **Move Ships**: Move ships from active system and one adjacent system to any voids in active system.
2. **Move Ground Units**: Move ground units from active system and one adjacent system to any worlds in active system.
   - If ships moved from adjacent system, ground units must come from same adjacent system.
   - Ground units move along contiguous, non-diagonal path of friendly areas.
3. **Resolve Combat**:
   - If contested area (mixed units), resolve combat (only one per Advance).
   - Else, may perform Orbital Strike.
- **Movement Rules**:
   - Ships: No path needed; voids hold max 3 ships.
   - Ground: Path required; worlds hold max skulls units.
   - No movement through Warp Storms.
   - Max 5 units may end in one area.

**Orbital Strike**
- Available only if no combat after Advance.
- Choose enemy world in active system without Bastion.
- Choose adjacent void with friendly ships.
- Roll dice = combined Combat Value of unrouted ships.
- Enemy units suffer damage = number of offence (gun) icons rolled.
- Units not destroyed do not become routed.

**Combat**
- **Preparation**:
  a. Roll dice = combined Combat Value (blue number) of all unrouted units (max 8 dice).
  b. Draw 5 Combat Cards.
  c. Reinforce: Attacker places up to # of their units in combat; then defender.
- **Execution (up to 3 rounds)**:
  a. Simultaneously choose 1 Combat Card.
  b. Resolve: Attacker first (general abilities, then unit abilities if unit present and unrouted).
  c. Assess Damage: Starting with attacker, each suffers damage = (opponent’s total offence) – (own total defence).
     - Choose unit/bastion to suffer damage.
     - Damage ≥ Health: Destroy.
     - Damage < Health: Route (unless Orbital Strike).
     - Excess damage carries over.
- **Resolution**:
  a. Determine Winner: Highest total Morale (dice + cards + unrouted units + bastions). Defender wins ties.
  b. Capture Structures: If attacker wins, replace structure control tokens.
  c. Clean Up: Discard Reinforcement tokens; shuffle Combat Cards back into deck.
- **Retreating**:
  - Loser retreats all units to one legal area.
  - Attacker: Must retreat to area at least one unit came from.
  - Defender: To friendly or uncontrolled area in active or adjacent system.
  - All retreating units become routed.
  - If cannot retreat, destroyed.

#### Other Rules
- **Friendly Area**: Contains own unit/structure, no enemy units.
- **Contested Area**: Contains units/structures from multiple factions.
- **Unit Capacity**: Voids = 3; Worlds = skull count. Excess units after order are destroyed.
- **Routed Units**: Sideways; cannot fight, contribute morale, or be targeted unless no other units. Rally in Refresh.
- **Bastions**: Not units; contribute dice and morale; cannot route; can be destroyed by damage.
- **Warp Storms**: Block movement; moved each Refresh Phase via Event card icon.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: A player wins immediately upon collecting Objective tokens = number of players.
- **End of Round 8**: Game ends. Player with most Objective tokens wins.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Most Objective tokens.
  2. Most friendly worlds.
  3. Most total units on board.
  4. Shared victory if still tied.
- **Elimination**: A player with no friendly worlds is eliminated.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I place Order in system with only adjacent presence?** Yes, adjacency (shared edge) counts.
- **What if I can’t move a Warp Storm?** Must still reveal top Event card, use movement icon, then shuffle back without resolving.
- **Can I use Forge/Cash for upgrades?** No. Forge/Cash only for unit/structure purchases.
- **Do Reinforcement tokens count toward unit limit in combat?** Yes, they are treated as units.
- **Can I resolve a Combat Card without the named unit?** No. Unit must be present and unrouted to use unit ability.
- **Can routed units fight?** Only if no other units and no bastion; they still roll dice but cannot use card effects.
- **Can I have more than 10 cards in Combat Deck?** No. Always 10 cards; swapping in upgrades requires removing a pair.
