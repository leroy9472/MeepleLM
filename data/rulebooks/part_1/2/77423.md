## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
*The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game* (LOTR LCG) is a cooperative card game where players take on the roles of heroes from Middle-earth, working together to complete challenging quests. The objective is to advance through the stages of a quest by accumulating progress tokens, while managing threats, enemies, and treacheries. The players win if at least one hero survives through the completion of the final stage of the quest. They lose if all players are eliminated—either by reaching a threat level of 50, losing all heroes, or being forced out by a card effect.

### 2. Components
- **Player Decks**: Each player constructs a deck from one of the Spheres of Influence (Leadership, Lore, Spirit, Tactics) and includes 3 Hero cards.
- **Hero Cards**: Represent the player’s characters, each with a threat cost, willpower, attack, defense, and hit points.
- **Threat Tracker**: A dial or counter used to track each player’s threat level. Starting threat is the sum of the threat costs of the player’s heroes.
- **Encounter Deck**: Contains enemies, locations, treacheries, and objectives specific to the chosen quest.
- **Quest Cards**: Represent the stages of the scenario; played in order from Stage 1A onward.
- **Tokens**: Resource, progress, and damage tokens.
- **First Player Token**: Indicates turn order.

### 3. Setup
1. **Player Setup**:
   - Each player selects a sphere, takes 3 Hero cards, and places them face up.
   - Sets threat tracker to the sum of the threat costs of their heroes.
   - Shuffles their player deck and draws 6 cards for a starting hand.
   - May take one mulligan: shuffle the initial hand back and draw 6 new cards.
   - The first player is chosen and receives the First Player token.

2. **Quest Setup**:
   - Choose a quest and arrange its quest cards in numeric order, starting with 1A on top.
   - Flip 1A to its 1B side.
   - Assemble the encounter deck using only cards listed on the quest.
   - Follow setup instructions on 1A: draw specified cards and place them in the staging area.
   - Shuffle the remaining encounter cards and place them face down as the encounter deck.
   - Place token pools (resource, progress, damage) next to the encounter deck.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of 7 phases:

#### 1. Resource Phase
- Each player:
  - Adds 1 resource token to each hero’s resource pool.
  - Draws 1 card from their player deck.
- If a player’s deck is empty, they continue with remaining cards (no reshuffle).

#### 2. Planning Phase
- Players take turns in clockwise order, starting with the first player.
- On their turn, a player may:
  - Spend resources from their heroes’ pools to play Ally and Attachment cards from hand.
  - Use resources from any hero within the same sphere of influence.
  - Neutral cards can be paid for with any hero’s resources.
- Attachment cards are placed overlapping the card they are attached to.
- A character may have no more than 2 restricted attachments.

#### 3. Quest Phase
- **Commit Characters**: Players, starting with the first player, commit any number of ready characters to the quest. Committed characters are exhausted.
- **Staging**: Reveal 1 encounter card per player from the encounter deck, one at a time. Resolve “When Revealed” effects before revealing the next card.
  - If the encounter deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.
  - Enemy and location cards go to the staging area.
  - Treachery cards are resolved and discarded (unless otherwise stated).
  - Keywords like **Doomed X**, **Surge**, and **Guarded** trigger during this step.
- **Quest Resolution**:
  - Total willpower (♂) of all committed characters is compared to total threat (♀) of all cards in the staging area (excluding active locations and engaged enemies).
  - If **willpower > threat**: The difference in progress tokens is placed on the active location (if any); excess goes to the current quest card. Completing a location discards it; completing the quest advances to the next stage.
  - If **threat > willpower**: Each player increases their threat by the difference.
  - If equal, no effect.

#### 4. Travel Phase
- If no location is currently active, players may travel to one location in the staging area.
- The first player makes the final decision.
- The location is moved next to the quest card and becomes the active location.
- Progress tokens from questing are placed on the active location until it is explored (i.e., has enough progress tokens to meet its quest points), then discarded.

#### 5. Encounter Phase
- **Step 1: Player Engagement**:
  - Each player may optionally engage one enemy from the staging area by moving it in front of them. Engagement cost is ignored.
- **Step 2: Engagement Checks**:
  - Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player compares their threat level to the engagement cost of remaining enemies in the staging area.
  - The enemy with the highest engagement cost that is ≤ the player’s threat engages that player.
  - Repeat until no more enemies can engage any player.

#### 6. Combat Phase
- **Deal Shadow Cards**:
  - One encounter card is dealt face down to each engaged enemy, starting with the highest engagement cost enemy per player, then proceeding clockwise.
  - If the encounter deck runs out, remaining enemies receive no shadow card.
- **Resolving Enemy Attacks**:
  - Starting with the first player, each player resolves attacks from enemies engaged with them:
    1. **Choose Enemy**: Select one engaged enemy to resolve.
    2. **Declare Defender**: Exhaust one character to defend, or leave the attack undefended.
       - A Sentinel character may defend for another player.
    3. **Resolve Shadow Effect**: Flip the shadow card and resolve any “Shadow” effect.
    4. **Determine Damage**:
       - **Defended**: Damage = enemy attack strength (艹) – defender defense strength (艸). Apply damage to defender.
       - **Undefended**: Full attack strength is applied as damage to a single hero (not an ally).
    - If the defender is destroyed, the attack becomes undefended.
    - Repeat for all engaged enemies.
- **Attacking Enemies**:
  - Starting with the first player, each player may attack enemies engaged with them:
    1. **Choose Enemy**: Select one engaged enemy.
    2. **Exhaust Attacker(s)**: Exhaust one or more ready characters.
       - Ranged characters may attack enemies engaged with other players.
    3. **Determine Damage**: Damage = total attack strength of attackers – enemy defense strength. Apply damage to enemy.
    - Each enemy may be attacked once per player per round.
  - After all attacks, discard all shadow cards from this phase.

#### 7. Refresh Phase
- All exhausted cards are readied.
- Each player increases their threat by 1.
- The First Player token passes to the left.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Exhausting**: Turning a card 90° to indicate it has been used. Exhausted cards cannot be used again until readied.
- **Resource Matching**: To play a card, spend resources from a hero with a matching sphere. Neutral cards require no match.
- **Engagement**: Enemies move from the staging area to a player’s control. Players may engage enemies voluntarily or via engagement checks.
- **Shadow Effects**: Resolved when an enemy attacks; effects are on the bottom of encounter cards and triggered when the shadow card is flipped.
- **Keywords**:
  - **Doomed X**: Each player raises threat by X when the card is revealed.
  - **Surge**: Reveal one additional encounter card after resolving “When Revealed” effects.
  - **Guarded**: Attach the next encounter card to the objective; it cannot be claimed until the attached card is dealt with.
  - **Ranged**: Can attack enemies engaged with other players.
  - **Sentinel**: Can defend against attacks on other players.
  - **Restricted**: Max 2 restricted attachments per character.
  - **Victory X**: When defeated, the enemy grants X victory points to the group.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: At least one player survives to complete the final stage of the quest.
- **Lose Condition**: All players are eliminated before quest completion.
- **Player Elimination** occurs if:
  - A player’s threat reaches 50.
  - All of a player’s heroes are defeated (damage ≥ hit points).
  - A card effect forces elimination.
- When a player is eliminated:
  - Their hand, deck, and controlled cards go to their owners’ discard piles.
  - Engaged enemies return to the staging area.
  - One fewer encounter card is revealed in future Quest Phases.
- **Scoring** (Optional):
  - Final score = (Threat cost of dead heroes) + (Damage on living heroes) + (10 × number of completed rounds).
  - Lower score is better.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Multiple Effects**: If multiple effects trigger simultaneously, the first player chooses the order of resolution.
- **Target Selection**: If a card effect targets a player or card and multiple options exist, the first player chooses.
- **Lasting Effects**: Effects that persist beyond a single phase. Net effect is applied; stats cannot go below 0.
- **Card Ownership vs Control**:
  - A player owns their deck and heroes.
  - Control can change (e.g., an ally controlled by another player is moved to their play area).
  - Attachments follow the control of the card they are attached to.
- **Running Out of Cards**:
  - Player deck: No reshuffle; continue with remaining cards.
  - Encounter deck: Shuffle discard pile to form a new deck when needed.
- **Action Windows**: Players may play events or use actions at any time unless explicitly restricted (e.g., bold steps).
- **Permanent Cards**: Cards with the **Permanent** keyword remain attached to a hero for the campaign and are removed from the game if the hero leaves play.
