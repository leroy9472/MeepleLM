### 1. Lore & Objective
This is a game of building a Deck. The Deck represents your Dominion. It contains your resources, victory points, and the things you can do. The goal is to have the most victory points in your Deck at game end.

The player with the most victory points in their Deck (including hand and discard pile) at the end of the game wins.

  - 4 players: 30  
  - 5 players: 40

- Place the Trash pile card near the Supply.
- Randomly determine starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn has three phases:
1. **Action Phase**: Play 0 or more Action cards. You start with 1 Action. Action cards may grant additional Actions.
2. **Buy Phase**: Spend coins (from Treasure and Action cards) to buy 1 or more cards (if you have Buys). Pay cost in coins; place purchased card in discard pile.
3. **Clean-up Phase**: Discard all played and unplayed cards from hand and play area to discard pile. Draw 5 new cards for next turn.

Play proceeds clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **+X Actions**: You may play X additional Actions this turn. Must complete current Action before playing next.
- **+X Cards**: Draw X cards immediately. Shuffle discard pile into new deck if needed.
- **+X Coins**: Gain X additional coins to spend in Buy phase.
- **+1 Buy**: Gain 1 additional Buy.
- **Discard**: Place card from hand face-up on discard pile.
- **Trash**: Remove card from game; place in Trash pile.
- **Gain**: Take card from Supply and place in discard pile.
- **Reveal**: Show card to all players, then return it to its original location (unless instructed otherwise).
- **Pass**: Place card face-down between you and another player; that player takes it into their hand.
- **Reaction**: Can be revealed outside your turn (e.g., in response to an Attack).
- **Attack Cards**: Affect other players. Labeled "Action - Attack".
- **Moat**: Can be revealed to avoid Attack effects.
- **Secret Chamber**: Can be played as Action (discard cards for coins) or as Reaction to Attack (draw 2, put 2 on deck).
- **Multi-type Cards**: Cards with multiple types (e.g., Action-Victory) count as both for all effects.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends at the end of any player’s turn when:
- The Province pile is empty, OR
- Any 4 Supply piles are empty (3 piles for 2–4 players).

Each player counts victory points from all cards in their Deck (hand, discard, and draw pile):
- Estate: 1 VP  
- Duchy: 3 VP  
- Province: 6 VP  
- Great Hall: 1 VP  
- Nobles: 2 VP  
- Harem: 2 VP  
- Curse: 0 VP  
- Duke: 1 VP per Duchy you have  
- Gardens (if used): 1 VP per 10 cards in deck (rounded down)

Tiebreaker: The player with fewer turns wins. If still tied, shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Shuffling**: When drawing or revealing cards and deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck (do not include currently revealed cards).
- **Throne Room**: Play an Action card twice. First resolve it fully, then resolve it again. Does not consume extra Actions beyond the initial play.
- **Bridge**: Reduces cost of all cards by 1 (minimum 0). Effect is cumulative (e.g., two Bridges = -2 cost).
- **Upgrade**: Draw 1 card, then trash 1 card and gain a card costing exactly 1 more. Costs affected by Bridge.
- **Torturer**: Each other player chooses: gain a Curse (to hand) or discard 2 cards.
- **Swindler**: Each other player trashes top card of deck and gains a card of same cost. If trashed card costs 0, may gain Curse instead.
- **Masquerade**: Not an Attack. All players simultaneously pass a card to the left. Only the player who played Masquerade may trash a card.
- **Multiple Reactions**: You may reveal more than one Reaction card to a single Attack (e.g., Secret Chamber then Moat).
- **Card Limits**: You may play only one Action card at a time, but may play multiple if granted +Actions. You may buy only one card per Buy, but may make multiple purchases if granted +Buys.
