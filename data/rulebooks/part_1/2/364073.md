# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective  
As a master jeweler during the Renaissance, you craft exquisite adornments to gain prestige and fortune. You compete against a rival to impress powerful leaders. The game ends when a player fulfills **one** of the following victory conditions at the end of their turn:

- Reach **20 or more Prestige points**  
- Acquire **10 or more Crowns**  
- Have **10 or more Prestige points on cards of the same color** (including cards using the "Copy" ability)

## 2. Components  
- **Victory tile**  
- **67 Jewel cards** divided into 3 levels:  
  - 30 Level 1 (●) cards  
  - 24 Level 2 (●●) cards  
  - 13 Level 3 (●●●) cards  
- **1 Bag**  
- **3 Privilege scrolls**  
- **25 Tokens**:  
  - 4 each of 5 gem colors (blue, white, green, black, red)  
  - 2 Pearls  
  - 3 Gold tokens  
- **1 Game board** with spiral token placement pattern  
- **4 Royal cards**

## 3. Setup  
1. Shuffle each of the three Jewel card decks (Level 1, 2, 3) separately.  
2. Place decks in a column with Level 1 at the bottom.  
3. Reveal cards to form a pyramid:  
   - 3 Level 3 cards  
   - 4 Level 2 cards  
   - 5 Level 1 cards  
4. Place the **Victory tile** above the pyramid.  
5. Place the **board** below the pyramid.  
6. Randomly place the 25 tokens on the board, starting from the center and following the spiral.  
7. Place the **3 Privilege scrolls** above the board.  
8. Place the **4 Royal cards** below the board.  
9. Randomly choose the first player. Their **opponent takes 1 Privilege scroll** to begin.

## 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, follow this order:

### Optional Actions (perform none, one, or both — in order)  
1. **Use Privilege(s):** Return 1 or more Privilege scrolls to the supply to take 1 non-Gold token (Gem or Pearl) each from the board.  
2. **Replenish Board:** If the bag is not empty, refill empty spaces starting from the center, following the spiral. Afterward, **your opponent takes 1 Privilege scroll**.  
   - If no Privileges are available above the board, take one from your opponent.

### Mandatory Action (choose exactly one)  
3. **Take up to 3 adjacent tokens:**  
   - Tokens must be in an uninterrupted horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.  
   - Cannot take Gold tokens.  
   - If you take **3 of the same color** or **2 Pearls**, your opponent takes 1 Privilege scroll.  
4. **Take 1 Gold token and reserve 1 Jewel card:**  
   - Only allowed if a Gold token is available and you have fewer than 3 reserved cards.  
   - Take 1 Gold token, then reserve:  
     - A card from the pyramid, **or**  
     - The top card from any deck (●, ●●, ●●●)  
   - Keep reserved cards face down (secret).  
   - Replace any reserved card in the pyramid with a new one from its deck (if available).  
5. **Purchase 1 Jewel card:**  
   - Choose a card from the pyramid or your reserved cards.  
   - Pay the cost (shown bottom-left) using your tokens.  
     - Gold tokens are wild and can substitute any Gem or Pearl.  
     - Bonuses from previously purchased cards reduce cost (minimum 0).  
   - Place the card face up in front of you.  
   - Return spent tokens to the bag.  
   - Immediately resolve any **ability** on the card (see Core Mechanics).  
   - Replace purchased pyramid cards from the corresponding deck.

### Cleanup Phase  
6. **Token Limit:** If you have more than 10 tokens (Gems, Pearls, Gold), discard down to 10. Return excess to the bag.  
7. **Victory Check:** Immediately check if you meet any victory condition. If yes, **you win immediately**.

## 5. Core Mechanics  

### Card Structure  
- **Upper Left:** Prestige points and **Ability** (if any)  
- **Upper Center:** Crown icons (0–2)  
- **Lower Left:** Cost in Gem/Pearl tokens  
- **Upper Right:** Bonus (reduction for future purchases, e.g., “1 green”)  

### Card Abilities (resolve immediately upon purchase)  
- **Another Turn (circular arrows):** Take an additional turn immediately.  
- **Copy Color (five gems):** Place this card overlapping a card with a bonus. This card’s bonus now counts as that color.  
  - You **cannot** purchase this card unless you already have at least one card with a bonus.  
- **Take Matching Token:** Take 1 token of this card’s color from the board. Ignore if none available.  
- **Take 1 Privilege:** Take 1 from the supply. If none available, take one from your opponent.  
- **Steal Token:** Take 1 Gem or Pearl from your opponent. Cannot steal Gold. Ignore if opponent has none.  
- **No Ability:** Some cards have none.

### Crowns  
- Some cards display 1 or 2 Crowns at the top.  
- When you acquire your **3rd Crown** (cumulative), take 1 available Royal card and resolve its ability.  
- When you acquire your **6th Crown**, take another Royal card and resolve it.  
- Royal cards are placed next to your collection and have no further effect unless specified.

### Privilege Scrolls  
- Used to take non-Gold tokens or trigger opponent gains during Replenish.  
- If you are entitled to take a Privilege and none are in the supply, take one from your opponent.  
- If you already possess all 3, no action occurs.

## 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends **immediately** at the end of a player’s turn if they meet **any one** of these conditions:

- **20+ Prestige points** (total from all cards)  
- **10+ Crowns** (total from all cards)  
- **10+ Prestige points on cards of the same color**  
  - Cards using the “Copy” ability count toward the color they are copying.  
  - Cards are grouped by bonus color in front of you; overlapping is allowed but top (points, Crown, bonus) must be visible.

There is **no final scoring** — the first to meet a condition wins.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I take fewer than 3 tokens?** Yes. You may take 1 or 2 adjacent tokens.  
- **Can I take tokens in a diagonal line?** Yes. Lines can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.  
- **What if I can’t perform any mandatory action?** You **must** perform the “Replenish Board” optional action, even if you already did it this turn. Then proceed to mandatory action.  
- **Can I use Gold to pay for Pearls?** Yes. Gold is wild and can substitute any Gem or Pearl.  
- **Do Pearl bonuses exist?** No. There are no cards that grant Pearl bonuses.  
- **Can I have more than 10 tokens during my turn?** Yes. You only discard down to 10 **at the end** of your turn.  
- **What happens when a deck runs out?** Cards are not replaced if the corresponding deck is empty.  
- **Can I use “Take Another Turn” more than once?** Yes. If you trigger it multiple times, you continue taking turns until you do not.  
- **What if all Royal cards are taken before 6th Crown?** Only 4 Royal cards exist. If you reach 6th Crown and none remain, you do not take one.  
- **Can I use a Privilege scroll multiple times in one turn?** Yes. Each scroll returned allows one non-Gold token.
