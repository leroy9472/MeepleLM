# Targi — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Targi is a strategic two-player game set in the North African desert, where players lead nomadic tribes competing for resources and influence. The objective is to score the most victory points (VP) by collecting goods, acquiring tribe cards, and completing rows in your tribe display.

### 2. Components
- 16 border cards (numbered #1–#16, forming a ring)
- 5x5 grid board with central 3x3 area
- 5 Goods cards and 4 Tribe cards (initially placed in checkered pattern)
- Robber marker
- 2 sets of player pieces:
  - 3 Targi figures (meeples) per player
  - 2 Tribe markers per player
- Resource tokens:
  - Goods: Dates, Salt, Pepper
  - Gold coins
  - Victory Point (VP) tokens (silver crosses)
- Two separate decks:
  - Goods cards
  - Tribe cards
- Starting resources per player: 2 Dates, 2 Salt, 2 Pepper, $1, 4 VP

### 3. Setup
1. Arrange the 16 border cards clockwise in numerical order around the central 3x3 grid.
2. Shuffle Goods and Tribe decks separately.
3. Draw 5 Goods cards and 4 Tribe cards; place them face-up in the center 3x3 grid in a checkerboard pattern (starting with a Good card in the top-left).
4. Place the Robber next to border card #1 ("Noble").
5. Each player takes:
   - 3 Targi figures and 2 Tribe markers of their color
   - 2 Dates, 2 Salt, 2 Pepper, $1, and 4 VP tokens
6. Decide starting player (e.g., last person who ate a date; otherwise, blue starts).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds in five phases:

**Phase 1: Move the Robber**
- First round: Place the Robber on card #1 (Noble).
- Subsequent rounds: Move Robber one space clockwise.
- If Robber lands on a corner card (Raid card), trigger a Raid:
  - Players (starting with current first player) must pay the cost shown (lose goods, gold, or VPs).
  - After all payments, immediately advance Robber one additional space clockwise.

**Phase 2: Place Targi Figures**
- Starting with the current first player, players alternate placing one Targi figure at a time until all 3 are placed.
- Restrictions:
  - Cannot place on a card occupied by the Robber.
  - Cannot place on corner (Raid) cards.
  - Cannot place on a card already occupied by any Targi.
  - Cannot place opposite an opponent’s Targi (directly across the board).
  - Placing opposite your own Targi or the Robber is allowed.

**Phase 3: Place Tribe Markers**
- Each player draws imaginary lines from their Targi figures into the central grid.
- Place one Tribe marker at each intersection of your own Targi lines within the 3x3 center.
- If two Targi are placed opposite each other, only one intersection exists → place only one Tribe marker.
- You may have 0, 1, or 2 Tribe markers placed.

**Phase 4: Perform Actions**
- Starting player performs **all** their actions first, in any order, but must complete one action before starting another.
- Second player then performs all their actions.
- Actions come from:
  - **Border Cards** where Targi are placed
  - **Center Cards** where Tribe markers are placed

**Border Card Actions:**
- **Caravan**: Draw top Goods card, take depicted resources, discard card.
- **Fata Morgana**: Move one of your Tribe markers to another unoccupied center card.
- **Silversmith**: Choose one:
  - Trade 2 identical goods → 2 VP
  - Trade 4 identical goods → 3 VP
  - Trade $1 → 2 VP
  - Trade $2 → 4 VP
- **Trader**: As many times as desired:
  - Trade 3 identical goods → $1
  - Trade 2 identical goods → 1 other good (player's choice)
- **Tribal Expansion (Noble)**: Draw top Tribe card. Choose to:
  - Play it immediately by paying cost
  - Keep it in hand (if no card already held)
  - Discard it

**Center Card Actions:**
- **Goods Card**: Take depicted goods, gold, or VP. Discard card.
- **Tribe Card**: Choose one:
  - **Play immediately**: Pay cost, place face-up in display
  - **Keep in hand**: Only if hand is empty (max 1 card)
  - **Discard**: Place on Tribe discard pile
- After using any center card, replace it with a card of the opposite type (face-down).

**Hand Rules for Tribe Cards:**
- Max 1 Tribe card in hand.
- If you draw a new Tribe card while holding one:
  - Must immediately play it (pay cost) or discard it.
  - Cannot keep both.
- To play or discard a card from hand, you must use the Noble action (Tribal Expansion border card).
- Using Noble to play a hand card still requires full payment.

**Phase 5: End of Round Cleanup**
- Flip all face-down center cards face-up.
- Pass the starting player token to the other player.
- Check resource limits:
  - Max 10 goods total (any combination of Dates, Salt, Pepper)
  - Max $3
  - Excess must be returned to supply (player chooses which goods to return).

Return to Phase 1 for the next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Lines of Sight**: Targi placement determines where Tribe markers can be placed via intersecting lines.
- **Resource Management**: Balance goods and gold under strict carryover limits.
- **Action Denial**: Strategic Targi placement blocks opponent actions.
- **Card Replacement**: Used center cards are replaced with opposite type, maintaining 5 Goods and 4 Tribe cards.
- **Deck Management**: When a deck is exhausted, immediately shuffle its discard pile to form a new deck.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End Game Triggers (game ends at end of round unless specified):**
- One player places their **12th Tribe card** in display → opponent completes their turn.
- Robber reaches **4th Raid card (#16)** → players resolve Raid, then game ends immediately.

**Final Scoring:**
Add:
- All VP tokens
- VP values (bottom-right corner) of all Tribe cards in display
- Bonuses from Tribe card text effects (e.g., endgame abilities)
- Row bonuses for completed rows (4 cards):
  - **+4 VP** for row with 4 cards of **same symbol** (Well, Camel-Rider, Oasis, Targia, Camp)
  - **+2 VP** for row with 4 cards of **different symbols**
  - Incomplete rows or rows with 2–3 matching symbols score **0**

**Tiebreaker:**
1. Most gold
2. Most goods (total count)
3. If still tied, game is a draw

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Gold is not a good** – it is a separate currency.
- **Edge cards are not goods cards** – only red center cards are "goods cards".
- **Can I place Targi with no intersections?** Yes – you may have 0 or 1 Tribe marker.
- **Can I use a Tribe card in hand without Noble?** No – Noble action is required to play or discard from hand (unless a Tribe card allows exception).
- **What if I can’t pay a Raid?** Opponent gains the VP amount you were supposed to lose (e.g., if Raid requires $1 or 3 VP and you can’t pay, opponent gains 3 VP).
- **Can I place Targi opposite Robber?** Yes – allowed.
- **Can I place Targi opposite opponent if I have a card allowing it?** No – the restriction is absolute; no card overrides "no opposite opponent Targi".
- **How many times can I use “pay 1 extra good to play from hand” card?** Once per round.
- **Can I trade at Trader after exceeding 10 goods?** Yes – you may exceed limits during actions, but must reduce to ≤10 goods and ≤$3 at end of round.
- **Do Silversmith trades require spending goods?** Yes – you must exchange them (not just possess).
- **What happens to Tribe card with stored gold?** Gold is reserved for paying future Tribe card costs only. It doesn’t count toward $3 limit, but can’t be used for Silversmith, Trader, or Raids.
