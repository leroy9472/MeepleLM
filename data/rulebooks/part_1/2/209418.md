## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Dominion is a deck-building card game where players start with a small deck of weak cards and use turns to acquire more powerful cards, aiming to amass the most victory points by the end of the game. Victory points are primarily earned through Victory cards, but some Action cards also provide points.

The game ends when either:
- The Province pile is empty, or
- Any three supply piles are empty.

At the end of the game, players count victory points from Victory cards and other point sources in their decks. The player with the most points wins.

2. **Components**  
- **Treasure Cards**: Copper (0 VP, $1), Silver ($2), Gold ($3)
- **Victory Cards**: Estate (1 VP), Duchy (3 VP), Province (6 VP), Gardens (1 VP per 10 cards in deck, rounded down)
- **Curse Cards**: -1 VP each
- **Action Cards**: 25 unique types from the Base and Intrigue sets (e.g., Village, Moat, Militia, etc.)
- **Supply Piles**: 10 randomized Kingdom Action card piles (10 copies each), plus standard Treasure, Victory, and Curse piles
- **Tokens**: Used for tracking in specific variants (e.g., coop mode)

3. **Setup**  
- For 2–4 players: Use one set of basic Treasure and Victory cards

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Each turn consists of three phases, in order:
1. **Action Phase**: Play 1 Action card (unless more Actions are gained). Play Actions from hand; follow instructions. Repeat until no Actions played.
2. **Buy Phase**: Spend coins to buy 1 card (unless more Buys are gained). Pay coins; place card in discard pile.
3. **Clean-up Phase**: Discard played cards and remaining hand. Draw 5 new cards for next turn.

A player may play only one Action card per turn unless +Actions are gained.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Actions**: Allow additional effects, card draws, or more Actions. Example: Village gives +1 Card, +2 Actions.
- **Buys**: Used to purchase cards from the Supply.
- **Coins**: Generated by playing Treasure cards or via Action effects (e.g., +$1).
- **Attacks**: Action cards with "Attack" on bottom (e.g., Militia, Witch). Affected players may react (e.g., Moat).
- **Reactions**: Cards like Moat can be revealed to block certain Attacks.
- **Trashing**: Some cards allow trashing (permanently removing) cards from hand, deck, or discard.
- **Gaining**: Taking a card from the Supply and placing it in hand or discard, depending on the card.

**Key Card Abilities**:
- **Moat**: +2 Cards; can be revealed to ignore Attack effects.
- **Militia**: +$2; each other player discards down to 3 cards (unless they reveal Moat).
- **Witch**: +2 Cards; each other player gains a Curse (if available).
- **Throne Room**: Play an Action card twice in a row (does not use extra Action).
- **Laboratory**: +2 Cards, +1 Action.
- **Vassal**: Discard the top card of your deck. If it's an Action card, you may play it (no Action cost).
- **Harbinger**: +1 Card, +1 Action; may put a card from discard pile on top of deck.
- **Merchant**: +1 Card, +1 Action; first Silver played this turn gives +$1.
- **Mine**: Trash a Treasure to gain a Treasure costing up to $3 more; gained card goes to hand.
- **Remodel**: Trash a card; gain a card costing up to $2 more than trashed card. Gained card goes to discard.
- **Artisan**: Gain a card costing up to $5, put it in hand; then put a card from hand onto deck.
- **Bandit**: Gain a Gold; each other player reveals top 2 cards, trashes a non-Copper Treasure if able, discards the rest.
- **Sentry**: +1 Card, +1 Action; look at top 2 cards of deck. Trash, discard, or put back one or both in any order.
- **Library**: Draw cards one at a time. Keep or set aside (only Action cards). Stop when you have 7 cards in hand. Discard set-aside cards.

- **Council Room**: +4 Cards, +1 Buy; each other player draws a card.
- **Festival**: +2 Actions, +1 Buy, +$2.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can I play multiple Throne Rooms?** Yes. Each allows playing one Action card twice. You can chain them.
- **Can I set aside non-Action cards with Library?** No. Only Action cards can be set aside.
- **Does trashing a card count as playing it?** No. Trashing removes it without triggering effects.
- **Can I reveal Moat after seeing the Attack?** Yes, but before any effects resolve.
- **If I play Vassal and reveal an Action, must I play it?** No. You may choose not to.
- **Can I use coins to increase gain/trash limits?** No. Cards like Workshop or Remodel have fixed limits.
- **If I play Sentry and shuffle, do I continue?** Yes. Continue resolving the card after shuffling.
- **Can I trash the card I just played?** No. Once played, it's no longer in hand.
- **Do +Cards effects stack?** Yes. You draw all cards at once unless specified otherwise.
