## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Advisors Expansion for Carnegie introduces 20 asymmetric "Advisor" cards that add unique strategic depth to the base game. Each Advisor card provides players with two distinct abilities:  
- A **Scoring condition** that contributes to end-game victory points.  
- A **game-time ability** triggered when a specific action (HR, Management, Construction, R&D, or Donations) is taken.

These cards allow players to pursue alternative strategies, encouraging replayability and personalized playstyles. The objective remains winning the base game of Carnegie by earning the most victory points (VP), but Advisors guide players toward specific strategic paths through their scoring and active abilities.

### 2. Components  
- 20 Advisor cards (double-sided, each with a Scoring side and an Action side)  
- Project tabs (used to mark player color and Advisor side "B")  

*Note: All other components are from the base game of Carnegie.*

### 3. Setup  
1. Shuffle all 20 Advisor cards into a deck.  
2. Each player draws 2 Advisor cards.  
3. Each player selects 1 Advisor to keep and discards the other.  
4. Flip the corresponding colored project tab on the player’s board to the **"B" side** (to indicate use of an Advisor). All other tabs remain on the "A" side.  
5. Proceed with standard Carnegie setup (timeline tiles, department selection, employee placement, etc.).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game follows the standard Carnegie turn structure (20 rounds). Each round consists of:  
1. **Select Timeline** – Active player chooses an action row.  
2. **Events** – Trigger income or donation based on timeline position.  
3. **Use Departments** – Players use departments matching the chosen action.  
4. **Activate Employees & End of Round** – Pay to activate employees; advance action marker.

**Advisor Integration:**  
- The **Scoring ability** is passive and contributes only at end-game scoring.  
- The **Action ability** activates during step 3 ("Use Departments") if the corresponding action is selected and the player uses a department of that type.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Advisor Cards  
Each Advisor has:  
- **Scoring Side**: A condition for earning VP at game end.  
- **Action Side**: An ability tied to one of five triggers:  
  - **Human Resources (HR)**  
  - **Management**  
  - **Construction**  
  - **Research & Development (R&D)**  
  - **Donation**  

*Example:*  
- **Industrialist**  
  - *Scoring:* 3 VP per fully pulled-out project tab.  
  - *Construction:* After connecting two major cities, gain 2 goods cubes.

#### Usage Rules  
- Action abilities are optional and may be used each time the corresponding action is taken and the player uses a matching department.  
- Restrictions like "max. 3 times per turn" or "once per turn" are specified on the card and must be followed.  
- The "B" side of the project tab must be visible to use the Advisor’s ability.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
At the end of 20 rounds, scoring includes:  
- All standard Carnegie end-game VP (connections, donations, departments, etc.)  
- **Advisor Scoring Bonuses** – Add VP based on the condition on the kept Advisor card.  

*Examples:*  
- **Contractor**: 2 VP per region at "railroad" level.  
- **Capitalist**: 1 VP per construction disk in a city with another player’s disk.  
- **Publisher**: 1 VP per donation made.  

The player with the highest total VP wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I use the Advisor ability more than once per turn?**  
A: Only if the card allows it (e.g., "max. 3 times per turn"). Otherwise, it’s once per action use.

**Q: What happens if I don’t use the action type matching my Advisor?**  
A: You miss the opportunity to use the ability that turn, but you still score the end-game bonus if the condition is met.

**Q: Do I have to use the Advisor ability when eligible?**  
A: No. Use is optional.

**Q: Can I keep both Advisor cards?**  
A: No. You must choose one and discard the other during setup.

**Q: Does flipping the project tab to "B" affect gameplay beyond tracking?**  
A: No. It is purely a visual indicator that an Advisor is in use.
