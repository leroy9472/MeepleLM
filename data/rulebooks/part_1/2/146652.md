3. Setup  
- Each player selects a Role Avatar and takes the matching Role Character Card, adding it to a personal deck of 7 Specialists and 5 Grunts (13 cards total). Shuffle and draw a 6-card hand.  
- Shuffle the 10 Sergeants and place them face down on the Sergeant space.  
- Place the 14 Hatchery cards face up on the Hatchery space.  
- Shuffle the 40 Strikes and place them face down on the Strike space.  
- Choose one Location and place it on the Location space.  
- Choose one Objective 1, one Objective 2, and one Objective 3; stack them on the Objective space with Objective 1 on top and Objective 3 on bottom.  
- For each Objective’s mini-deck:  
  - Objective 1: 9 cards  
  - Objective 2: 11 cards  
  - Objective 3: 13 cards  
  Shuffle in one random Drone card per player into each mini-deck. Stack them with Objective 1’s deck on top and Objective 3’s on bottom to form the Hive deck.  
- Choose four Characters, shuffle all 56 cards together, and place them face down on the Barracks. Place the top 5 cards face up in the HQ.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn consists of four phases:  
1. **Hive Phase**: Draw the top Hive card and place it face down in the rightmost space of the Complex. Push existing cards leftward if needed. If a card is pushed from the Airlock, it enters the Combat Zone and is revealed.  
2. **Action Phase**: Play cards from hand. Resolve abilities, generate Recruit Points (★) and Attack (♣). Use these to:  
   - Recruit Characters from HQ (pay ★ cost) or Sergeants (pay 3★).  
   - Scan rooms (pay Attack equal to room’s Scan Cost) to reveal hidden cards.  
   - Fight revealed enemies (spend Attack equal to enemy’s Attack value).  
   - Use Class or Crew abilities if conditions are met.  
   - Coordinate cards to other players (if applicable).  
3. **Strike Phase**: Each enemy in the Combat Zone strikes from right to left. For each strike, draw one Strike card. If the total damage from Strikes equals or exceeds a player’s Health, they die.  
4. **Cleanup Phase**: Discard all played and unplayed cards. Draw 6 new cards. Reshuffle discard pile if deck is empty.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Class & Crew Abilities**: A card with a Class or Crew ability (e.g., “: +2 Attack”) triggers only if another card of that Class/Crew was played earlier in the turn. Must be used if possible unless “You may” is specified.  
- **Keyword Abilities**:  
  - **Coordinate**: On another player’s turn, set aside a Coordinate card, draw a replacement, and let that player play a copy. At turn end, card goes to your discard pile. One per player per turn.  
  - **Vigilant**: Leaves play only at end of turn. Can trigger Class/Crew abilities only on turn played.  
  - **Sacrifice**: After playing, may kill the card at any time during turn to gain its Sacrifice effect. Still counts for Class/Crew and retains generated resources.  
  - **Mobilize**: When recruited, immediately use its Mobilize ability after refilling HQ.  
  - **Facehugger**: When revealed, place in front of current player. That player and the next may fight it. If not killed, the initial player is impregnated: Facehugger dies, and a Chestburster is placed in their discard pile.  
  - **Chestburster**: When drawn, player dies. If Alien Player rules are active, they return as an Alien. While in deck, player cannot be struck or impregnated by Facehuggers (they pass to next player).  
- **Hive Mechanics**:  
  - **Enhanced**: When revealed, place top Barracks card face-up underneath. Its class determines the Alien’s enhancement. When killed, place enhancement card on bottom of Barracks.  
  - **Mega-Enhanced**: Has five Barracks cards underneath, one face-up. When “killed,” move active card to bottom of Barracks and reveal next. Dies after last enhancement is removed.  
  - **Ranged**: During Strike Phase, strikes after Combat Zone enemies, from left to right in Complex.  
  - **Flying**: Occupies Air Spaces above Complex. Moves left at start of each Hive Phase. Drops into Combat Zone if above Airlock. Not in Complex.  
  - **Runner**: At end of Hive Phase, moves one space left, pushing others.  
  - **Stationary/Does Not Move**: Blocks movement; incoming cards skip past.  
  - **Subdue**: If killed, placed in Operations instead of Dead Enemies.  
  - **Escape**: Enters Combat Zone, resolves Escape effect, then leaves play.  
- **Deck Management**: When deck is empty and a draw is required, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition**: Complete all three Objectives. The third Objective typically requires defeating a Final Enemy (only fightable on Objective 3).  
- **Loss Condition**: All players die. Death occurs from Strike damage ≥ Health or drawing a Chestburster.  
- **Advanced Endings**:  
  - **Hidden Agenda**: Evil player wins if all others die and they play their Agenda card. Good players win by completing Objectives, especially if Evil player is revealed.  
  - **Alien Player**: Player returns after Chestburster death. Wins by killing all others. Game ends if all players are Alien Players (loss).  
- **Scoring (Optional)**:  
  - Regular Game: 1 point per surviving player.  
  - Hidden Agenda: Good team gets 1 point per survivor + 5 bonus if Evil player was present. Evil player gets 2 points per Good player who died.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Running out of cards**:  
  - Hive deck: Shuffle Dead Enemies into new deck. If this happens twice, players lose.  
  - Barracks: HQ no longer refills when empty.  
  - Strike deck: Shuffle Discarded Strikes into new deck.  
  - Sergeants: Cannot recruit when stack is empty.  
- **Multiple Facehuggers**: All die if impregnation occurs, but player gains only one Chestburster.  
- **“Next Player”**: If only one player remains, “next player” refers to self.  
- **Copying Cards**: Copy acts as playing the card. Grants all benefits, including Class/Crew, but cannot be killed or discarded.  
- **Timing**: Simultaneous effects resolved by current player’s choice. Player order in simultaneous effects: current player first, then clockwise.  
- **Can’t vs Can**: “Can’t” overrides “Can.”  
- **Partial Effects**: Do as much as possible if full effect cannot be resolved.  
- **Grown in a Lab**: Clones a card played this turn. Gains all attributes but remains a Ripley card for relevant effects.  
- **Ventilation Lock**: Blocks Ventilation Shafts. Place current Objective card and entire Hive deck on it.
