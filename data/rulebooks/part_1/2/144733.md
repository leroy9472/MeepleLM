## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Russian Railroads is a strategic worker placement game where players develop their own railway networks across three rail lines—Trans-Siberian, St. Petersburg, and Kiev—while advancing industrial capabilities. The goal is to maximize victory points through track expansion, locomotive upgrades, factory development, and end-game bonuses.

### 3. Setup  

#### Base Game (3–4 Players)  
- Place main board; lay out 5 ? tokens and associated cards.  
- Shuffle 10 end-bonus cards, remove 2 at random (face down), leave 8 in pile.  
- Sort locomotives by number into stacks (1–9); one tile per number available.  
- Sort engineers into A and B piles; place 4 B engineers on spaces 3–6, 3 A engineers on spaces 1, 2, and star space (horizontal side up).  
- Each player takes:  
  - Player board  
  - 3 black tracks (on space 1 of each rail line)  
  - 5 personal workers (6 in 2/3P), 2 in supply  
  - 1 coin (2 coins in 2P)  
  - #1 locomotive (placed on player board)  
  - 1 industry marker at "0"  
  - 7 different ? tokens  
  - 1 Kiev medal, 1 revaluation token  
  - 1 scoring pawn at 100, 1 turn order pawn randomly placed  
- Deal turn order cards; starting from 4th player, then 3rd, then 2nd, each picks a starting bonus card and gains its benefit. First player receives nothing.  

#### 2-Player Game  
- Use 2-player board side  
- 6 workers (5 in hand, 1 in supply), $2  
- Remove 2 locomotives per number stack  
- 6 rounds (6 engineers used)  
- Players may fight for current turn order  

#### 3-Player Game  
- 6 workers, $1  
- Remove 1 locomotive per stack  
- 6 rounds

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

#### Round Structure  
Each round proceeds as follows:  
1. **Action Phase**: In turn order, players place workers (or coins) on unoccupied action spaces to perform actions.  
2. **Passing**: A player may pass at any time, flipping their turn order card and scoring the points shown.  
3. **End of Round**: When all players pass:  
   - Determine next turn order based on turn order action spaces.  
   - Workers used for turn order may be reused (2nd position first, then 1st) on single-worker actions.  
   - Scoring phase.  
   - Reset: return all workers, clear coins, flip income markers face-up, slide engineers right, discard unpurchased engineer.  
   - Players take new turn order cards.  
   - In final round, replace turn order spaces with "last round" tile.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Track Extensions  
- Three independent rail lines per player.  
- Tracks: Black → Grey → Brown → Natural → White (in strict order).  
- Natural: max 2 pieces; White: only on Trans-Siberian.  
- Unlock colors by reaching:  
  - Space 2 → Silver (Grey)  
  - Space 6 → Brown  
  - Space 10 → Natural  
  - Space 15 → White  
- Immediately place new color tracks to the left of player board.  
- Movement: split advancements across lines.  
- Cannot overtake or share spaces.  

#### Locomotives  
- Required to score track spaces.  
- Acquire via:  
  - 1 worker: take lowest-numbered locomotive or flip it to factory  
  - 3 workers: take 1 locomotive and 1 factory (any order)  
- Place locomotives to the left of rail lines:  
  - Kiev/St. Petersburg: 1 max  
  - Trans-Siberian: 2 max (sum values)  
- Upgrade: replace with higher-numbered locomotive; displaced locomotive may be reused elsewhere or flipped to factory and returned to supply.  
- Maximum 4 locomotive slots; 5th becomes factory.  

#### Factories & Industry  
- Factories are backs of locomotives or special tiles.  
- Place left to right on industry track.  
- Replace only after all 5 spaces are full; old factory goes to supply (face-up).  
- Advance industry marker via action spaces; gaps require factories to progress.  
- Factory abilities (trigger when marker lands):  
  1. Score sum of engineer numbers  
  2. Build locomotive or factory  
  3. Reuse one-worker action space  
  4. Place 2 doublers  
  5. 1 industry advancement  
  6. Take 1 coin  
  7. 2 track advancements of choice  
  8. Score sum of two best locomotives  
  9. Choose end-bonus card or score 10 VP  

#### Engineers  
- One engineer available per round (rightmost on board).  
- Pay 1 coin to recruit; place in front of you as personal action space.  
- Two horizontal engineers on board are shared action spaces this round.  
- At round end, shift engineers right; unpurchased one is discarded.  
- Engineer actions (partial use allowed):  
  - See list in source (e.g., track/industry advancements, doubler + points, etc.)  
- Mini Expansion engineers (e.g., Olga, Ludmilla) add special effects.  

#### Turn Order  
- Place worker on 1st or 2nd turn order space to claim that position next round.  
- Cannot claim current position (except 2P).  
- After all pass:  
  - Assign 1st/2nd positions to claimants; others shift right.  
  - Workers from turn order spaces may be reused:  
    - 2nd position worker acts first, then 1st  
    - Must go to single-worker action space; cannot combine with other workers/coins  

#### Auxiliary Actions  
- Doubler: place next available x2 marker on Trans-Siberian (left to right)  
- Coins: gain 2 coins  
- Workers: gain 2 temporary turquoise workers (return at round end)  

#### ? Tokens (Single-Use)  
- Get 4 track advancements (current colors only)  
- Get 5 industry advancements  
- Place second industry marker at 0 (split advancements; both scored)  
- Place 3 doublers on Trans-Siberian  
- Place revaluation token: boosts brown, natural, white track values  
- Place Kiev medal at space 5: +20 VP if reached with grey track + locomotive  
- Choose ? card: apply effect, then take end-bonus card or 10 VP  

#### Scoring Spaces (Player Board)  
Immediate bonuses (require locomotive unless noted):  
- **No locomotive needed**:  
  - Reach space 2,6,10,15 (TS): unlock next track color  
  - Reach end of any line (black): +10 VP  
  - Reach space 7 (Kiev, black): gain permanent extra worker  
- **Locomotive required**:  
  - Space 3 (TS, brown): +1 permanent worker  
  - Space 7 (SP, grey): entire line doubles in value during scoring  
  - Spaces 1–4,8 (Kiev, black): extra points during scoring  
  - Space 13 (TS) or 4/6 (SP), black: choose any ? token

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Round Scoring  
After all pass:  
- **Rail Lines**: Score each space reached by locomotive.  
  - Color determines value (see player board):  
    - Black: 0  
    - Grey: 1  
    - Brown: 2  
    - Natural: 3  
    - White: 4  
  - Each space belongs to one color (from that color’s piece backward to next)  
  - x2 markers: double value of that space  
  - SP line: if space 7 reached with grey + loco, entire line doubles  
  - Kiev spaces 1–4,8: +1 VP each if reached with black + loco  
- **Industry Track**: Score value of last star reached by marker  

#### End Game  
After 7 rounds (6 in 2/3P):  
- **End-Bonus Cards**: Score VP per card (e.g., 10 per completed line, 4 per factory, etc.)  
- **Engineer Majority**:  
  - Most engineers: 40 VP  
  - Second: 20 VP  
  - Tie: highest individual engineer number wins  
- **Other End Bonuses** (if applicable):  
  - Stock Market (American): 1st = 20 VP, 2nd = 10 VP  
  - Doublers (≥4 or ≥7): 20 or 30 VP  
  - Hired engineers: 6 VP each  
  - Etc.  

Total VP determines winner.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Coins as workers**: Yes; can be combined with workers. Not vice versa.  
- **Reusing action spaces**: Only single-worker spaces; can be reused via factory #3 or engineer #8.  
- **Black worker**: Grants +1 black track advancement whenever used on action that gives ≥1 black advancement. Applies even when reusing space.  
- **Foundry (Coal module)**: Spend 2 coal to use; may close after use to gain boilerman (+1 loco or double factory benefit).  
- **Second industry marker**: Can activate factory again, but only once per factory.  
- **Revaluation token**: Only one per board (base or expansion, not both).  
- **Steelworks (American)**: Take when claiming last loco of 4/6/8; triggers general payout.  
- **Golden Spike**: +25 VP per completed Transcontinental line per scoring.  
- **Olga (Mini)**: Can use opponent’s engineer space; must be able to complete action.  
- **Ludmilla + Black Worker**: Can trigger extra advancement if bonus card gives black track.  
- **Factory replacement**: Allowed only after 5 factories; may discard special factories (e.g., Steelworks).  
- **Permanent upgrades (workers, revaluation)**: Once achieved, remain for game.
