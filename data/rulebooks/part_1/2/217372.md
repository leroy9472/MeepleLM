## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players are expedition leaders racing through the jungle to be the first to reach El Dorado, the legendary city of gold. The goal is to reach one of the three finishing spaces adjacent to El Dorado. The first player to reach El Dorado wins. If multiple players reach it in the final round, the winner is determined by tie-breakers.

2. Components  
- Game board composed of terrain tiles, strips, and an ending tile  
- 6 Blockade tiles  
- Player materials per color: 2 playing pieces (meeples), 1 expedition board  
- Starting decks: 8 cards per player (1 Sailor, 3 Explorers, 4 Travelers)  
- 54 Expedition Cards, sorted into 18 types (3 cards each)  
- Market Board with slots for 6 card piles; 12 additional piles placed above  
- Starting Player ("Hat") token  
- Cave tokens (36 total), placed in piles of 4 on each cave space  
- Optional components from expansions: Curse tokens, Demon cards, Muisca cards, Familiars, Heroes, Dragons, Treasures, etc.

3. Setup  
- Assemble the jungle path using the starting tile, 6 terrain tiles, 2 terrain strips, and the ending tile in the designated configuration.  
- Shuffle the 6 Blockade tiles and place one face-down between each pair of terrain tiles; then flip them face-up. Return unused blockades to the box.  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 2 playing pieces (only 1 used in 3–4 player games; both used in 2-player games)  
  - 1 expedition board  
  - Starting deck (1 Sailor, 3 Explorers, 4 Travelers), shuffled into a draw pile  
- Starting player is the first to sit down. They receive the Hat token and place their piece(s):  
  - In 2-player: P1 on spaces #1 and #3; P2 on #2 and #4  
  - In 3–4 player: one piece per player, placed clockwise on next available starting space  
- Set up the Marketplace:  
  - Place 6 card piles (marked with a dot in the bottom right) on the Market Board  
  - Place the remaining 12 piles above the Market Board (out of play until slots open)  
- For Caves variant: Shuffle all 36 Cave tokens and place face-down piles of 4 on each Cave space on the board.  
- Each player draws 4 cards to begin.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has three phases:  
1. Play Cards  
2. Discard Played Cards  
3. Draw Cards  

Play proceeds clockwise.

**Phase 1: Play Cards**  
A player may play any number of cards from their hand to:  
- Move their playing piece(s), and/or  
- Buy up to 1 new card  

Cards are placed above the expedition board as they are played. Each card can be used only once per turn.

**Movement Rules**  
- To move onto a **landscape space** (green/jungle, blue/river, yellow/village):  
  - Play 1 card matching the space’s symbol  
  - Card’s power must be ≥ the number of symbols on the space  
  - Leftover power may be used to continue moving (same requirements apply)  
  - Cannot combine multiple cards to meet power requirement  
- To move onto **rubble**: Discard the number of cards shown (any type)  
- To move onto **base camp**: Remove the number of cards shown from the game (any type)  
- Cannot move onto **mountains**, **caves**, or **occupied spaces** (including your own piece)  
- **Blockades**: To pass, fulfill the requirement (matching symbol and sufficient power). The first player to do so removes and keeps the blockade (for tie-breaking). After removal, all players may pass freely. Leftover power may be used to continue movement or remove a blockade.  
- **Caves**: If a playing piece ends movement adjacent to a cave, draw the top cave token and place it face-up in front of you. To explore the same cave again, you must move away (to a non-adjacent space), stop, then return.  
- **Joker (white) cards**: Choose machete, paddle, or coin when played.

**Buying Cards**  
- May buy exactly 1 card per turn  
- Coin cards: worth their power in coins  
- All other cards: worth ½ coin each  
- Total value must meet or exceed the card’s cost  
- Purchased card goes to discard pile (not hand)  
- If a market slot is empty, player may buy from any pile above the board. If so, they move the remaining two cards of that pile into the vacant market slot.

**Special Cards (Items)**  
- Cards with a crossed-out card symbol (🞩) are one-time use. After using their ability, remove them from the game.  
- Exception: If used to discard for rubble, as ½ coin, or unplayed, they go to discard instead.

**Phase 2: Discard Played Cards**  
All cards played (placed above expedition board) go to the discard pile. Remaining hand cards may be kept or discarded at player’s choice.

**Phase 3: Draw Cards**  
Draw until you have 4 cards in hand. If draw pile is empty, shuffle discard pile to form a new draw pile.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Use**: Each card used once per turn for movement or buying.  
- **Movement**: Single card powers multi-space movement via leftover power. No card combining.  
- **Cave Tokens**: One-time use abilities. Examples:  
  - Machete/Coin/Paddle: Use like a card for movement or buying  
  - Draw Card: Draw 1 card  
  - Remove Card: Remove any card from hand  
  - Replace Cards: Play up to 4 cards, then draw that many  
  - Discard Item Card: Save an item card from removal  
  - Occupied Space Movement: Move through occupied spaces (not mountains)  
  - +1 Movement: Move like Native (ignore requirements)  
  - Change Card: Change symbol of next card played  
- **Curses (if included)**: Drawn on demon spaces. Examples:  
  - Lethargy: Cannot use a symbol until lifted by discarding sufficient symbol power  
  - Misfortune: Cannot play cards until 2 cards are discarded  
  - Paralysis: Other players move your pieces  
  - Voodoo: Left player moves your piece twice  
  - Misery: Cannot play purple cards until a purple card is discarded  
  - Cave Fever: Cannot play cave tokens until one is discarded  
  - Torment: Draw a demon card  
- **Tunnels**: Count as demon spaces; adjacent if on same tile. Moving through requires resolving both ends’ demon symbols.  
- **Swamp**: Requires exact power match (equal to number of crocodiles)  
- **Flowing Water**: After ending movement here, move one space in arrow direction if possible (no chaining)  
- **Danger**: Cannot end turn here; must move further in same turn

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Game Trigger**: When any player reaches one of the three finishing spaces (with their last playing piece), the final round begins. Each remaining player takes one final turn.  
- Exception: If the last player of a round reaches a finishing space first, the game ends immediately.  
- Upon reaching a finishing space, move the piece into El Dorado to free the space.  
- **Winning**: The player who reaches El Dorado first wins.  
- **Tie-Breakers**:  
  1. Most blockades collected  
  2. Highest-numbered (highest power) single blockade  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move both pieces in a 2-player game with one card?** No. Each card applies to one piece only.  
- **Can I use leftover power to remove a blockade?** Yes.  
- **Can I use a cave token to move through a mountain?** No. Cave tokens do not allow mountain movement unless specified (e.g., Geologist).  
- **Can I use a Native or cave token to move onto an occupied space?** No. Occupied spaces are impassable unless using the specific "Occupied Space Movement" token.  
- **Can I use a card’s effect and also its symbol for buying?** No. Each card used only once per turn.  
- **What if I draw a curse I can’t lift?** You keep the curse until you can fulfill its requirement. You may still take other actions.  
- **Can I buy a card and use it the same turn?** No. Purchased cards go to discard pile and must be drawn later.  
- **Can I use a cave token immediately after drawing it?** Yes, on the same turn.  
- **Can I move alongside a cave to get multiple tokens?** No. Must leave and return to explore again.
