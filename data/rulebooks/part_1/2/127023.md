4. After all actions:
   - Award prayer points and Victory Points
   - Check for game end

### Night Phase

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Actions
Players have 5 Action tokens to place across 5 turns. Must have at least one token in each of the three pyramid levels by end of phase.

- **Pray**: Gain 2 prayer points (3 with Priest power)
- **Raise Pyramid**: Pay amount equal to new level. Level 4 pyramids grant 1 temporary VP.
- **Buy Power Tile**: Must control matching-color pyramid at same or higher level. Cost equals tile level.
- **Recruit**: Spend X prayer points to recruit X units to your city.
- **Move/Attack**: Move one troop. Movement capacity is typically 1 space.

### Movement
- Default movement: 1 space
- Can include land moves and teleportations
- Teleport: Spend 2 prayer points to move from pyramid (level 1+) to any obelisk
- Harbors allow Nile crossing as normal movement
- Walls restrict city entry: must start adjacent to wall
- Can gather or leave units during movement
- Movement ends when entering space with opponent (triggers battle)

### Battle
Triggered when moving into or recruiting into space with opponent.

1. **War Council**: Each player chooses one battle card to play and discards one face down.
2. **Preparation**: Players may secretly add DI cards under battle card.
3. **Confrontation**: Reveal cards simultaneously. Pay DI card costs.
4. **Resolution**: Calculate Strength:
   - Units + Battle card + Power tiles + Creatures + DI cards + 1 if in own city
   - Defender wins ties
5. **Casualties**: Each side loses units equal to opponent's Damage minus own Protection
6. **Reward**: Attacker who wins and has surviving units gains 1 Battle VP
7. **Aftermath**:
   - Loser chooses retreat or recall
   - Winner chooses stay or recall
8. **Cleanup**: Discard played battle card face up; return discarded card to hand when all 6 are used

### Creatures
- Gained by buying corresponding Power Tile
- Can be placed in city district with units or held in reserve
- Grants bonuses to troop it accompanies
- Not destroyed in battle; returns to city or reserve
- One creature maximum per troop/space

### Power Tiles
- Three colors with different focuses:
  - White/Diamond: Prayer and resources
  - Red/Ruby: Attack and movement
  - Blue/Sapphire: Defense and control
- Effects are immediate upon purchase
- Cannot own duplicate tiles (same artwork)
- Night-effect tiles resolve during Night Phase

### Divine Intervention Cards
