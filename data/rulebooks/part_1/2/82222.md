### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has three phases:

#### I. Action Phase  
Players may perform actions in any order until they choose to stop or cannot continue.  
**Available Actions**:
- **Move**: Use Engine (spend Armed Marker, roll die, move) or Impulse (flip token, move up to value). Ships may move through occupied spaces but cannot end there.
- **Attack**:
  - *Blasters*: Range 1, Line of Sight (LOS) required.
  - *Missiles*: Range 2–6, LOS required.
  - *Ram*: Use Engine against adjacent ship; attacker takes unblockable damage equal to roll.
- **Missions**:
  - *Draw (Minor)*: On Mission Point, draw 3 cards; keep 0 or 1.
  - *Objective*: Complete action listed (e.g., deliver cargo, destroy target).
  - *Reveal*: Flip card face up after objective.
  - *Complete*: Deliver at Mission Point; gain payment, 1 FP, and bounty.
- **Cargo**:
  - *Buy*: 2 cubes for 1,000 Credits from Economy Board.
  - *Sell*: 1,000 Credits per cube. Selling ≥2 matching cubes grants 1 FP.
  - *Mine/Salvage/Harvest/Quarry*: Roll d20; 1–10 = damage/loss, 11–20 = gain cube.
  - *Collect (Minor)*: Pick up jettisoned cargo.
  - *Jettison (Minor)*: Discard cargo or abort mission.
- **Explore**:
  - *Scan*: Spend 1 Energy to draw and place adjacent Sector Tile.
  - *Blind Jump (Minor)*: Declare unexplored space, draw tile, place, and move there. Blind jumping into a Star destroys the ship.
  - *Collect Exploration Token (Minor)*: First to land gains reward (1 FP, 1,000 Credits, or nothing).
- **Other**:
  - *Rescue Stranded Player*: Adjacent, transfer 2 Energy (must have ≥3). Gain 1 FP.
  - *Use Abilities*: Activate ship’s Ability Card (spend Energy, follow instructions).
  - *Sift Relic*: At The Kiln, reveal Relic Token and choose reward.

#### II. Business Phase (Only if on Planet or The Kiln)  
Conduct any of the following in any order:
- **Recharge Energy**: Full recharge, free.
- **Repair Damage**: Tier 1/2: 1,000 Credits; Tier 3: 2,000 Credits. Removes all damage.
- **Melt Ice Damage**: Free at planet or The Kiln.
- **Buy Outfits**: Pay cost; must fit in Hold.
- **Sell Outfits**: Undamaged only; receive half cost (rounded up).
- **Rearrange Hold**: Reorganize items (except damaged Outfits or Damage Markers).
- **Buy New Ship**: Upgrade one Tier. Pay cost. Keep Outfits, Cargo, Credits, Abilities. Lose Damage and Bounty. Gain 1 FP.
- **Buy Fame**: Pay 5,000 Credits for 1 FP (cannot be final FP needed to win).

#### III. Status Phase  
1. **Freeze**: For each Ice Damage, place 1 Ice Damage in orthogonally adjacent empty spaces. If ship fills with Ice Damage, it is destroyed.
2. **Claim Fame**: Claim any earned FP or Titles.
3. **Draw Titles/Events**: First player to reach/past purple Title or pink Event space draws a card and resolves it.
4. **Refresh**: Flip exhausted Ability Cards and Impulse Token face up.
5. **Economy Board Demand**: If any resource section is empty, place 1,000 Credits there. Next player to generate that resource gains the bonus.
6. **Arm Markers**: Spend 1 Energy per marker to move Disarmed/Used markers to Armed Spaces (free on planet).

After player’s turn: If controlling an NPC, take its turn immediately after.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Line of Sight (LOS)**: Center-to-center line. Blocked by Asteroids, Debris, Stars, Planetary Shields, and unexplored spaces.
- **Combat Steps**:
  1. Acquire Target (range + LOS)
  2. Declare Attack (spend markers/energy)
  3. Declare Defense (shields/abilities)
  4. Roll (attacker then defender)
  5. Resolve (Attack Value – Defense Value = damage)
  6. Re-arm (defender may re-arm shield markers at 1 Energy each)
- **Damage**:
  - Placed in Hold; each marker reduces affected Outfit rolls by 1.
  - If Hold fills with damage (including Ice), ship is destroyed.
  - Cargo in damaged space is jettisoned.
- **Stranded**: 0 Energy and 0 Armed Markers. Can only use Impulse and Minor Actions.
- **Bounty**:
  - Gained by: evading Planetary Shield (roll 11–17), destroying Innocent ship (+1,000), illegal missions.
  - Outlaw ships (with bounty) cannot use Lawful Planet Entrances.
  - Removed by death or buying new ship.
- **NPCs**:
  - Spawn when their Sector Tile is placed.
  - Controlled by player who holds their card; takes turn after that player.
  - Avoid Asteroids, Debris, Planetary Shields, Stars if possible.
  - Use Gates; cannot Scan or Blind Jump.
  - Target closest ship by physical distance.
