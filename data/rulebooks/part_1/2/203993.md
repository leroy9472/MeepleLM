### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Lorenzo il Magnifico*, players lead noble Renaissance families in Florence, competing to gain influence through resource management, military conquest, political maneuvering, and church support. The goal is to amass the most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the game through strategic use of family members, development cards, and leader abilities.

### 2. Components
- Game Board with Action Spaces (Towers, Harvest, Production, Market, Council Palace)
- 5 Development Card Decks (Territories, Characters, Buildings, Ventures, Special Tower)
- Development Cards (by type and period I–III)
- Player Boards
- Family Members (3 colored, 1 neutral per player)
- Discs for Turn Order, VP, Military, and Faith Tracks
- Excommunication Cubes (3 per player)
- Resources: Wood, Stone, Coins, Servants
- Dice (3 standard dice)
- Personal Bonus Tiles
- Leader Cards
- Special Development Cards (Houses of Renaissance expansion)
- Special Tokens
- Covering Tiles (for 2–3 player games)
- Adaptation Tile
- Excommunication Tiles (3 per period)
- Auction and Family Tiles (Houses of Renaissance)

### 3. Setup
1. **Board Setup**:
   - Place the Special Tower Tile to the right of the board.
   - Place the New Council Tile on the board.
   - Create 5 Development Card Decks: separate by type and period, shuffle each, then stack with Period III on bottom, II in middle, I on top. Draw 8 cards per deck.
   - Place decks above their corresponding Towers.
   - Randomly place 1 Excommunication Tile per period on the board.
   - Place the Adaptation Tile on a colored Tower (based on player count).
   - Add Covering Tiles for 2–3 player games.

2. **Player Setup**:
   - Each player chooses a color and takes:
     - 1 Player Board
     - 3 Excommunication Cubes
     - 4 Family Members (3 colored, 1 neutral)
     - 4 Discs (for Turn Order Track)
     - Starting resources: 2 Wood, 2 Stone, 3 Servants (varies slightly by source)
   - Assign first player. Set Turn Order clockwise; starting coins: 1st: 0, 2nd: 1, 3rd: 2, 4th: 3, 5th: 4.
   - Place Personal Bonus Tiles (advanced side up). Players choose one in reverse turn order.
   - Randomly assign Family and Auction Tiles: pair each Family Tile with an Auction Tile.
   - Players place one Family Member on an Auction Tile offering. If occupied, must outbid; displaced player must re-place.
   - After all players occupy different Auction Tiles, each gains the Family Tile and starting resources.
   - Deal 4 Leader Cards to each player. Draft clockwise until each has 4 cards in hand.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game consists of **3 Periods**, each with **2 Rounds** (6 Rounds total).

**Each Round proceeds in phases**:

#### 1) Round Setup
- Draw 4 cards from each deck and place one per floor in each Tower (bottom to top).
- Roll 3 dice; assign values to black, white, orange.
- Neutral Family Member base value = 0.

#### 2) Actions (in Turn Order)
- Players place one Family Member per turn on an available Action Space.
- Family Member value = corresponding die value (colored) or 0 (neutral).
- Minimum required value shown under action space.
- Spend Servants (1:1) to increase value.
- Bonuses from action spaces (e.g., 3rd/4th floor of Towers) are received immediately and can be used to pay card costs.
- May discard Special Tokens for their effects during this phase.

**Action Areas**:

- **Towers (Territories, Characters, Buildings, Ventures)**:
  - Place Family Member on floor (value ≥ requirement).
  - Pay card cost (if any).
  - If Tower already occupied (by any player), pay 3 Coins.
  - Only one colored Family Member per player per Tower (neutral exempt).
  - Immediate effect (lightning) resolved upon acquisition.
  - Permanent effect triggers later via Harvest/Production.
  - Max 6 cards per type.

- **Harvest & Production Areas**:
  - Left space: 1 Family Member max; full value.
  - Right space: any number, but -3 penalty to value; player may place only one colored Family Member across both spaces per area (neutral allowed additionally).
  - Action Value = placed member’s value + modifiers.
  - Activate Personal Bonus and all cards with activation value ≤ Action Value.
  - Resources used in Production must be present before activation.

- **Market**:
  - 4 spaces (2 in 2–3 player games); 1 Family Member per space.
  - Gain immediate reward (Council Privilege).

- **Council Palace**:
  - Unlimited Family Members; placed in queue (left to right).
  - Gain 1 Council Privilege and 1 Coin.
  - Determines next round’s turn order.

- **Leader Actions (during Action Phase)**:
  - Discard 1 Leader Card → gain 1 Council Privilege.
  - Play a Leader Card from hand (if requirements met).
  - Activate a face-up played Leader Card (flip face-down to gain effect).

#### 3) Vatican Report (Rounds 2, 4, 6 only)
- Required Faith Points: Period I: 3, II: 4, III: 5.
- If player has ≥ required Faith Points, may choose to:
  - **Support Church**: spend all Faith Points, gain VP equal to pre-spend value, reset to 0.
  - **Not Support**: place Excommunication Cube on current period’s tile (suffers ongoing penalty).
- If player lacks required Faith Points, must place cube and suffers penalty.
- **Round 6 Exception**: Excommunicated players gain VP equal to current Faith Points, then reset to 0.

#### 4) End of Round
1. Discard all Development Cards from board.
2. Update Turn Order:
   - Order based on left-to-right queue in Council Palace.
   - Players not placing there go to end, maintaining relative order.
3. Retrieve all Family Members.
4. Flip all face-down Leader Cards face-up.
5. Move Adaptation Tile one Tower to the right (cycles from 4th to 1st; never on 5th).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Family Members**: 4 per player (3 colored, 1 neutral). Value determined by die (colored) or 0 (neutral). Can be boosted with Servants.
- **Action Resolution**: Must meet minimum value; bonuses used immediately.
- **Resource Management**: Resources unlimited; large pieces = 5.
- **Card Acquisition**:
  - Territories: No cost; require Military Points to place (not spend).
  - Characters: Coin cost; placed in line; provide VP and effects.
  - Buildings: Resource cost; activate via Production.
  - Ventures: Resource or Military cost; VP at endgame.
- **Leader Cards**: Requirements must be met to play. Effects are permanent or once-per-round. Can be discarded for Council Privileges.
- **Special Tokens**: New resource type; can be spent for effects; gained via cards or abilities.
- **Excommunication**: Penalty tiles affect ongoing play; Martin Lutero immune.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after Round 6. Final scoring:

- **Territories**: 1 VP (3), 4 VP (4), 10 VP (5), 20 VP (6)
- **Characters**: 1 (1), 3 (2), 6 (3), 10 (4), 15 (5), 21 (6) VP
- **Ventures**: Sum of printed VP
- **Military**: 5 VP for 1st, 2 VP for 2nd. Ties: all 1st get 5 VP (no 2nd); all 2nd get 2 VP.
- **Remaining Resources**: 1 VP per 5 total (Wood, Stone, Coins, Servants)
- **Leader Effects**: e.g., Sisto IV gains +5 VP when supporting Church.

**Winning**: Highest VP wins. Tiebreaker: Turn Order Track (earlier player wins).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you use bonus resources to pay the 3-coin tower occupation fee?** No. The 3 coins must be paid from existing supply.

- **Can you use resources gained during Production to activate other Buildings in same action?** No. All required resources must be present before activation.
- **Do Leader requirements use endgame VP?** No. Requirements must be met at time of play; endgame VP not counted.
- **Can you have negative VP?** Yes. VP markers can go below 0.
- **Can you place on an occupied Market space?** No. Each Market space holds only one Family Member.
- **Can you activate a card with value higher than your Action Value?** No. Only cards with activation value ≤ Action Value are activated.
- **Can you use Special Tokens from River Port or Merchant for Piero della Francesca?** No. Tokens on cards do not count toward requirements.
