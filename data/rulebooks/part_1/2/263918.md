## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Queen Gimnax has ordered the reclamation of the northern lands. As a cartographer in her service, you are tasked with mapping the territory to claim it for the Kingdom of Nalos. The queen issues edicts specifying which lands she values most, and you earn reputation stars by fulfilling these demands. The Dragul oppose your efforts with monster outposts, so strategic placement is essential.  

**Objective**: Earn the most reputation stars by the end of four seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter) by meeting seasonal scoring goals, collecting coins, and minimizing monster-related penalties.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Assign Map Sheets**: Give each player one map sheet. All players must collectively choose to use either side A (Wilderness) or side B (Wastelands).  
2. **Distribute Pencils**: Give one pencil per player. Provide extras if more than four players.  
3. **Personalize Maps**: Each player writes their cartographer’s name at the top, optionally adding a title and family crest.  
4. **Arrange Edict Cards**: Place the 4 Edict cards in alphabetical order (A, B, C, D) face-up in a row.  
5. **Prepare Scoring Cards**:  
   - Separate the 16 Scoring cards into 4 stacks by card back (Woods, Farm/Water, Village, Dimensions).  
   - Shuffle each stack.  
   - Randomly draw one card from each stack and place it face-up under Edict A, B, C, and D respectively.  
   - Return remaining Scoring cards to the box.  
6. **Season Stack**: Place the 4 Season cards in order (Spring → Summer → Fall → Winter) as a face-up stack. Spring is on top.  
7. **Ambush Deck**: Shuffle the 4 Ambush cards and place them face-down off to the side.  
8. **Explore Deck**:  
   - Shuffle the 13 Explore cards.  
   - Take the top card from the Ambush deck and shuffle it into the Explore deck (unseen).  
   - Place the Explore deck next to the Season stack.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game spans four seasons. Each season consists of multiple turns. Each turn has three phases:  

#### 1. EXPLORE PHASE  
- Reveal the top card of the Explore deck and place it face-up in a vertical column (to track cumulative time).  
- **Ruins Card Handling**:  
  - If the first card revealed this season is a Ruins card, immediately reveal another card and place it on top.  
  - If that card is also Ruins, reveal a third. Continue until a non-Ruins card is revealed.  
- Ambush and Rift Lands cards are resolved during Draw Phase.

#### 2. DRAW PHASE  
All players simultaneously:  
- Choose one terrain type and one shape from the revealed Explore card.  
- Draw the shape on their map:  
  - Cannot overlap filled spaces (mountains, wastelands, or previously filled areas).  
  - Can be rotated or flipped.  
  - Does not need to be adjacent to existing terrain.  
- Fill the shape with the chosen terrain type.  

**Special Cases**:  
- **If no legal placement**: Draw a 1×1 square anywhere and fill with chosen terrain.  
- **Ruins Rule**: If one or more Ruins cards were revealed earlier, the current shape **must** overlap an unfilled Ruins space (if possible). If not possible, draw a 1×1 square anywhere.  
- **Rift Lands Card**: Each player draws a 1×1 square anywhere and fills it with any terrain type shown on the card.  
- **Ambush Card**:  
  - Pass maps in the direction of the arrow (left or right).  
  - Each player draws the depicted shape on their **neighbor’s** map, filling it with **Monster** terrain.  
  - If impossible, draw a 1×1 Monster square anywhere on that map.  
  - Return maps to owners. Discard the Ambush card.  
  - *Note*: If an Ambush follows a Ruins card, resolve Ambush normally. The Ruins effect applies to the next Explore card.

**Coin Track Bonuses**:  
- Fill all four adjacent spaces around a Mountain → fill next coin symbol.  
- Choose a shape that includes a coin icon → fill next coin symbol.  

#### 3. CHECK PHASE  
- Sum the time values (top-left of each revealed Explore card).  
- Compare total to the current Season card’s time threshold:  
  - **Spring**: 8  
  - **Summer**: 7  
  - **Fall**: 6  
  - **Winter**: 5  
- If total ≥ threshold → Season ends.  
- If total < threshold → Return to Explore Phase for next turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Terrain Types  
- Forest  
- Village  
- Farm  
- Water  
- Monster  
- Mountain  
- Ruins (special space type, not terrain)  
- Wasteland (filled space, cannot be drawn on)  

#### Adjacency & Clusters  
- **Adjacent**: Spaces sharing a side (not diagonal).  
- **Cluster**: Connected group of same terrain type (including single spaces).  

#### Filled Spaces  
- Mountain, Monster, Wasteland → always filled.  
- Ruins → filled only when drawn on.  
- Empty spaces surrounded on four sides by filled spaces or map edge count for **The Cauldrons**.  

#### Scoring Cards (by category)  

**Woods**  
- **Sentinel Wood**: 1 star per Forest space adjacent to map edge.  
- **Treetower**: 1 star per Forest space surrounded on all four sides by filled spaces or edge.  
- **Greenbough**: 1 star per row/column with ≥1 Forest space (same space can score row and column).  
- **Stoneside Forest**: 3 stars per Mountain space connected to another Mountain via a Forest cluster.  

**Farm and Water**  
- **Canal Lake**: 1 star per Water adjacent to Farm + 1 star per Farm adjacent to Water.  
- **The Golden Granary**: 1 star per Water adjacent to Ruins + 3 stars per Farm on Ruins.  
- **Mages Valley**: 2 stars per Water adjacent to Mountain + 1 star per Farm adjacent to Mountain.  
- **Shoreside Expanse**: 3 stars per cluster of Farms not adjacent to Water or edge + 3 stars per cluster of Water not adjacent to Farm or edge.  

**Village**  
- **Wildholds**: 8 stars per cluster of 6+ Village spaces.  
- **Greengold Plains**: 3 stars per Village cluster adjacent to 3+ different terrain types.  
- **Great City**: 1 star per Village space in largest cluster not adjacent to Mountain.  
- **Shieldgate**: 2 stars per Village space in second-largest cluster. (If multiple largest, score one as largest, next as second-largest.)  

**Dimensions**  
- **Borderlands**: 6 stars per complete row or column of filled spaces.  
- **The Broken Road**: 3 stars per complete diagonal line of filled spaces touching left and bottom edges.  
- **Lost Barony**: 3 stars per space along one edge of the largest filled square.  
- **The Cauldrons**: 1 star per empty space surrounded on all four sides by filled spaces or edge.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End of Season Scoring  
After each season:  
1. **Evaluate Two Scoring Cards**: Based on Season card:  
   - Spring → Edict A & B  
   - Summer → Edict B & C  
   - Fall → Edict C & D  
   - Winter → Edict D & A  
2. Each player:  
   - Scores stars from the two active Scoring cards.  
   - Gains 1 star per filled coin symbol.  
   - Loses 1 star per **empty space adjacent to a Monster** (only once per space, even if adjacent to multiple Monsters).  
3. Record scores on map sheet.  

#### Prepare for Next Season  
- Discard the current Season card. Reveal the next.  
- Reshuffle all revealed Explore cards into a new deck.  
- Take the next Ambush card from the Ambush deck and shuffle it into the Explore deck.  
- *Note*: Unrevealed Ambush cards remain in deck. Multiple Ambush cards may accumulate.  

#### End of Game  
After Winter scoring:  
- Total all reputation stars earned over four seasons.  
- **Winner**: Player with most stars.  
- **Tiebreaker**:  
  1. Fewest stars lost to Monster penalties (sum of all Monster-related losses).  
  2. If still tied, all tied players share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Diagonals**: Never count as adjacent.  
- **Cluster Definition**: Connected orthogonally (side-by-side), same terrain.  
- **Ruins + Ambush Interaction**: Ambush resolves immediately. Ruins requirement applies to next Explore card.  
- **Ambush on Neighbor’s Map**: Must place shape if possible. If not, 1×1 Monster anywhere.  
- **Multiple Ambush Cards**: Possible in later seasons. Only one is added per season, but unrevealed ones persist.  
- **Coin Track**: Filled when surrounding a Mountain or choosing a coin-shaped tile. One coin per qualifying event.  
- **1×1 Rule**: Applies whenever no full shape can be legally placed.
