The 7th Continent is a cooperative survival and exploration game where players take on the roles of explorers cursed after returning from a mysterious land. The goal is to survive the environment, explore the continent, and ultimately lift all curses by banishing their corresponding Curse cards from play.

## 3. Setup
1. Choose 1–4 characters; each takes their Character card and places their figure on the starting terrain card.
2. Create the Action Deck:
   - Combine 35 common Basic Idea cards + 5 character-specific Idea cards per player.
   - Add Curse cards matching selected Clue cards.
   - Shuffle in 4 "Death is Lurking!" Curse cards.
3. Place the "Shoulder Bag" card face-up; store Clue cards and Notes under it.
4. Sort Exploration Deck numerically; use dividers for access.
5. Sort Adventure Deck by area (I, II, III…); use area dividers.
6. Draw card 001 from Exploration Deck; place it face-up as starting tile.
7. Place random Adventure cards (fog side up) on spaces indicated by arrows.
8. Each player receives a fire miniature.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Active Player** chooses an available action from:
   - Current terrain card
   - Attached event cards
   - Hand (Idea, Bonus, State)
   - Inventory items
2. **Involve Other Players**: Any player on the same terrain may assist.
3. **Items Step**: Use inventory items; reduce durability by 1.
4. **Cost Step**: Draw minimum required cards from Action Deck. Reduce cost with resources, cards, or player cooperation (−X cards, +X stars).
5. **Result Step**: Reveal drawn cards. Count full stars (½ stars combine into 1). Apply modifiers from used cards.
6. **Idea Step**: Active player may take one revealed Idea card into hand (or give to involved player).
7. **Discard Step**: Discard remaining revealed cards to Action Deck Discard.
8. **Consequence Step**:
   - **Success**: Apply white box effect.
   - **Failure**: Apply black box effect; all involved players gain "paranoid" State card if multiple players participated.
9. **Hand Limit**: Discard excess Idea/Bonus cards to stay within limit.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Movement**: Use Move action (on character card). Cost and success requirements shown on target terrain card. Must resolve fog cards before placing terrain.
- **Crafting**: Use Craft action on Idea cards. Reduce draw cost if required resources are present on terrain or event card.
- **Combining Items**: Stack up to player limit (1–4 players: 4/3/2/2 items, 4/3/3/2 cards per stack). If new item shares keyword with top card, add its durability.
- **Saving the Game**: All characters must be on same terrain. Discard all board cards except current terrain. Save character hands, inventories (with durability), Action Deck, and Discard using Save cards.
- **Resuming**: Return all saved components. Rebuild terrain, hand, inventory, and decks.
- **State Cards**: Apply effects immediately. To remove, follow card instructions (e.g., rest, use item). Drawn states may trigger discards from Action Deck.
- **Experience**: Gain Experience cards. At 5/10/15… points, exchange for higher-value cards. Spend to add Advanced Idea cards to Action Deck.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: Banish all Curse cards (from Action Deck or Discard). Game ends immediately with victory.
- **Loss Conditions**:
  - Reveal a Curse card from Action Deck Discard during Cost or State resolution.
  - All characters simultaneously receive "Your Adventure is Over" consequence.
- **Lifting a Curse**: Banish the Curse card. If multiple curses remain, continue playing. Only banish the clue from journal, not the Curse card itself.
- **End of Game**: If curses are lifted or all lost, return all cards to decks (except explicitly excluded). No carryover between games unless replaying same curse.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Missing Adventure Card**: If card number is unavailable, return all cards from "The Past" to Adventure Deck and draw again.
- **No Green Exploration Card**: Use yellow version if green is unavailable.
- **Using Sixth Sense**: Action card allows looking at top 2 Action Deck cards and placing them back on top or bottom. **Must be discarded after use** (errata correction).
- **Fire Miniature Use**: Provides crafting resource and movement bonus when moving onto its tile. Does not persist after saving.
- **Crafting Without Resources**: Allowed, but at full energy cost.
- **Discarding from Item Stacks**: Can discard individual cards (e.g., for "discard card with keyword" effects) without breaking stack. Durability unchanged.
- **Combining Items After Acquisition**: Only possible at moment of crafting or discovery. Cannot combine later via trade or other means.
