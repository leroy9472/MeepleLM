## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Your mission in *Endeavor: Deep Sea* is to have the most beneficial impact on the world’s oceans, from the surface to the deepest trenches. Over six rounds (seven in solo mode), players expand their reach into unexplored ocean zones, gain attributes (Reputation, Inspiration, Coordination, Ingenuity), earn Impact, publish Journals, and complete scenario-specific Goals. The player or team with the highest score wins, based on attribute tracks, Impact board placement, Journals, Specialists, and Goal achievements.

2. Components  
- 37 Ocean Boards (5 depths, each called a "zone" when in play)  
- 51 Specialist Tiles (21 types, each with Junior/Blue and Senior/Gold sides)  
- 4 Team Leader Tiles (Senior side only)  
- 5 Double-Sided Scenario Sheets (Missions 1–10)  
- 24 Journals (standard) + 8 Anchor Journals (starting)  
- 6 Bonus Goal Cards (Co-op/Solo)  
- 6 Setback Cards (Co-op/Solo)  
- 120 Discs (30 per player)  
- 80 Impact Markers (20 per player)  
- 20 Track Cubes (5 per player)  
- 12 Vessels (3 per player)  
- 1 Wave Marker (start player indicator)  
- 1 Score Pad  

3. Setup  
- Choose a Scenario Sheet and place it on the table.  
- Set up Ocean Boards as diagrammed (e.g., Mission 1 uses specific initial zones).  
- Shuffle remaining boards into 5 face-down stacks by depth (1–5).  
- Shuffle Dive tokens; place indicated number face-down on each Dive site (e.g., The Sea Star starts with 4).  
- Shuffle Anchor Journals and Journals separately. Lay out 4 random Anchor Journals face-up; return extras. Keep Journal deck nearby.  
- Prepare Specialist Tray:  
  - Tiers 1–4: Flip all Junior-side up, stack by title in correct columns.  
  - Tier 5: Shuffle Junior-side up; place 3 random tiles in each pocket of Tier 5 column.  
- Randomly choose starting player; give them the Wave marker.  
- Each player:  
  - Chooses a color and takes matching components:  
    - Player mat  
    - Team Leader tile (place near mat, disc on activation circle)  
    - 30 discs (place supply away from Staging Area)  
    - 5 track cubes (place on 0 of each track)  
    - 20 Impact markers (keep near Impact board)  
    - 3 Vessels  
  - Deploys starting Vessel to Launch Zone per Scenario; gains Arrival Bonus.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has two phases:  

**Phase 1: Preparation (each player in clockwise order)**  
1a) **Recruitment**: Recruit one Specialist from tray. Your Reputation track sets max tier (• symbols). New Specialist enters on Junior side. Resolve any immediate gains (e.g., Inspiration).  
1b) **Effort**: Gain discs to Staging Area equal to your Inspiration track (⊕ symbols).  
1c) **Reassignment**: Reclaim discs from Specialists to Staging Area equal to your Coordination track (■ symbols).  

**Phase 2: Activation (clockwise turns until all pass)**  
- On your turn, either:  
  a) Activate a Specialist by placing a disc from Staging Area on their activation circle, then perform their action(s).  
  b) Spend a Dive token (instead of activating).  
  c) Perform an action from a published Journal (instead of activating).  
- Actions include: Travel, Sonar, Dive, Conserve, Journal.  
- After all players pass, round ends. Pass Wave clockwise.  
- After round 6 (7 in solo), proceed to final scoring.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Travel**: Move a Vessel to another zone. Max depth and distance = your Technology level (Ingenuity track ● symbols). Gain Arrival Bonus at destination.  
- **Sonar**: Place a disc on a Sonar track in a zone with your Vessel. May gain reward or Discover a new zone.  
  - **Discover**: Draw two boards from depths indicated by icon. Choose one to place legally (depth-1 anywhere; deeper requires zone above). Return other to stack. Gain Discovery Bonus. Add Dive tokens if applicable.  
- **Dive**: Draw top token from Dive site. It shows Research and/or effect. You may:  
  - Spend it for Research (add to track, max 12)  
  - Use its effect (e.g., Travel, Impact)  
  - Store one at end of turn; discard excess.  
  - May spend tokens before, during, or after activating a Specialist.  
- **Conserve**: Pay Research cost, place disc in Conservation site. May complete a link. Gain rewards (often Impact).  
- **Journal**:  
  - Choose unoccupied Journal site with Field symbol matching a displayed Journal.  
  - Pay Journal’s Research cost, place disc in site.  
  - Claim Journal (keep face-up, effects active). Draw replacement.  
  - Published Journals grant: Points, immediate benefits, benefits to others, or actions (use disc to activate).  
- **Promotion**: Flip a Junior Specialist to Senior. Gain new attributes, Research, or Impact. Disc on activation circle is discarded.  
- **Completing Links**: When both ends of a line are occupied by discs, both players gain the link’s reward. If same player, gain once. Resolve in clockwise order starting with active player.  
- **Special Zone Features**:  
  - **General Effect** (yellow triangle): Ongoing or trigger effect (e.g., "Travel away: treat Tech level +1").  
  - **Action Effect** (yellow arrow): Triggers after performing action (e.g., "Dive: gain 1 Impact").  
  - **Marked Spaces** (yellow ring): Special rule if you occupy that spot (e.g., "Conserve here: Conserve again").  
- **Impact Board**:  
  - When you gain Impact (from any source), place a marker on an empty hex with entry arrow or adjacent to occupied hex.  
  - Gain reward printed on hex.  
  - Some hexes score points at end (per Scoring Legend).  
  - ∞ hex allows unlimited markers (stack or use adjacent area).  
  - Scenario-specific rules may modify placement (e.g., depth-based, moving markers).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Final scoring (in order):  
1. **Attribute Tracks**: Each marker scores value of bracket it occupies.  
2. **Impact Board**: Score points for markers in scoring hexes (per Scenario legend).  
3. **Journals & Tier-5 Seniors**:  
   - Journals with point values score at end.  
   - Tier-5 Senior Specialists have unique scoring criteria.

5. **Leftover Research & Discs**: Add Research (including from stored Dive token) and discs in Staging Area. Divide by 3, round down.  

**Co-op Mode**:
