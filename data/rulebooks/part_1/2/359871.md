## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Arcs is a spacefaring strategy game where players lead factions through a decaying galactic empire. The goal is to gain Power by fulfilling ambitions—declared objectives tied to specific actions and resource accumulation. A game ends when a player reaches the required Power threshold (27 for 4 players, 30 for 3, 33 for 2) or after Chapter 5. The player with the most Power wins.

In the campaign variant, the game spans three Acts. Acts I and II last 3 chapters; Act III lasts 4 chapters or ends early if a player completes a final objective. The winner is the player with the most accumulated Power across all Acts. Ties are broken first by Fate tier (A > B > C), then by turn order.

2. **Player Setup**:

     - 3 ships and 1 city in system marked A.
     - 3 ships and 1 starport in system marked B.
     - 2 ships in system(s) marked C.

   - 2-player only: The player without initiative may discard and redraw all 6 cards (mulligan).
   - Discard unused Action Cards into a facedown discard pile.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
A game is played in chapters, each consisting of multiple rounds.

**Round Structure**:
1. **Player with Initiative Takes Turn**:
   - Play an Action Card as the lead card.
   - May declare an ambition (if card value 2–7).
   - Take Prelude Actions (spend resources or activate card effects).
   - Take actions equal to the number of pips on the card (1–3).

2. **Other Players Take Turns**:
   - **Surpass**: Play a higher-value card of the same suit. Take actions equal to pips.
   - **Pivot**: Play a card of a different suit. Take one action from the played card.
   - **Copy**: Play any card face down. Take one action from the lead card.
   - May seize initiative (by playing an extra card face down or playing a 7).

3. **Check Initiative**:
   - If initiative was seized, the seizing player holds it.
   - Else, the player who Surpassed with the highest card value takes initiative.
   - If no one Surpassed, initiative remains with current holder.

4. **Discard Cards & Check for New Round**:
   - Discard all played cards.
   - If any player has cards, start a new round.
   - If all players are out of cards, end the chapter.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Resources**: 5 types (Material, Fuel, Weapons, Relics, Psionics). Gained by taxing cities or raiding. Stored in resource slots on player board.
- **Prelude Actions**: Before taking main actions, spend resources:
  - Material: Build or Repair.
  - Fuel: Move.
  - Weapon: This turn, use action pips for Battle.
  - Relic: Secure.
  - Psionic: Take any action listed on the lead card.
- **Guild Cards**: Gained by influencing and securing from the Court. Provide new actions, modifiers, and add to ambitions (except Weapon cards).
- **Actions**:
  - **Tax**: Gain 1 resource from a Loyal or controlled Rival city. Capture 1 agent if taxing a Rival city.
  - **Build**: Place a city/starport in an empty slot with Loyal presence, or a ship at a Loyal starport.
  - **Move**: Move ships to an adjacent system. From a Loyal starport, may take Catapult moves.
  - **Repair**: Flip a damaged Loyal ship or building to fresh.
  - **Influence**: Place 1 agent on a Court card.
  - **Secure**: Take a Court card where you have the most agents. Capture Rival agents as Captives.
  - **Battle**: Attack in a system with Loyal ships. Collect dice, roll, resolve hits, then raid.
- **Outrage**: Destroying a city provokes Outrage of that type. Discard all matching resources and Guild cards. Outraged resources cannot be spent for Prelude actions.
- **Ransack the Court**: After provoking Outrage, secure any card with the defender’s agents. Take agents as Trophies.
- **Control**: A player controls a system if they have more fresh ships than any Rival. Control allows taxing Rival cities, restricting movement, and damaging built pieces.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
