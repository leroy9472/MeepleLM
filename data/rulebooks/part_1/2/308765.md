### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each player takes exactly **16 turns**, proceeding clockwise.  
Each turn consists of three phases:

#### 1) Choose an Action Tile  
- Take 1 Action Tile from the Crane:  
  - **Red Zone**: Pay the Gold cost shown.  
  - **Blue Zone**: Gain the VP shown.  
  - If the tile has a **5 VP Icon**, gain 5 VP.  
- Gain the **Bonus from the Crane Space** (e.g., S, Gold, Stone, Egg, etc.) — may be used anytime during your turn.

#### 2) Perform Actions  
- Perform **one** of the two actions shown on the chosen Action Tile.  
- If the action has been upgraded, gain the **top-most Upgrade Tile’s bonus** when performing it.  

**Optional Actions (Once per Turn)**:  
- **Buy 1 Extra Action**: Pay **2 Gold Windows**, or **1 Gold + 1 Silver Window** to perform any one of the six actions.  
- **Refresh Hex Row**: Pay **1 Gold or 1 Stone** to discard 2 tiles from **one** Hex Row (Upgrade, Wall, Building) and draw 2 replacements. Can include Special 'S' tile if present.

#### 3) End of Turn  
1. **Discard** down to a maximum of **2 Windows**.  
2. **Rotate Crane 1 space clockwise**.  
   - If the arrow starts on the current space (i.e., cube drops), rotate **2 spaces** instead.  
   - If a tile rotates past the **Blue Zone**, move it to the first empty space in the **Green Zone** and place the ⊕ (5 VP token) on it.  
3. **Return** the used Action Tile to the first empty space in the **Red Zone**.  
   - If blocked by the cube, continue rotating until a Red space is free.  
4. **If the Crane’s Cube dropped**, move the **Platform Cube 1 space left**.  
   - In **2-player game**, Era II triggers when the white arrow aligns with the yellow arrow (after cube drop).  
   - If the Platform Cube crosses the threshold based on player count, replace all Era I Hex Tiles with Era II Tiles.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you upgrade an already upgraded action?**  
  Yes. Stack new tile on top. Only new tile's bonus applies. Old tile still counts for endgame scoring.  
- **Do you gain alignment bonuses from old upgrades?**  
  No. Only new symbol connections count.  
- **Can you use Crane bonus after end of turn?**  
  No — must use during your turn.  
- **What if no Red Zone space is free when returning tile?**  
  Keep rotating Crane until one is available.  
- **Can you claim a Seal without a cube on 'Claim a Seal'?**  
  No. You must have placed a cube there after reaching end of a resource track.  
- **Do you score for both rows and tokens on Cathedral/Hunger Wall?**  
  Yes — row position and token × column are separate.  
- **Can you use Tech Tile abilities after game ends?**  
  No — only during your turns.  
- **Can you buy extra action before or after main action?**  
  Yes — at any point during your turn.
