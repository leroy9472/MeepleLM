### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Voidfall*, players represent galactic houses battling the Voidborn — an ancient, corrupting force that spreads through rifts in space. The Domineum Empire, once expanded under Voidborn influence, has collapsed. The remaining houses now fight to reclaim territory, manage corruption, and gain influence to restore order. The goal is to amass the most Influence (victory points) over three cycles by completing objectives, acquiring technology, and managing resources effectively.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game has **3 Cycles**, each with **3 Phases**:

#### A. Preparation Phase
1. (Cycle 1: Skip) Remove bottommost trade token.
2. (Cycle 1: Skip) 
   - Cycle 2: Remove Improvement Block → Improved techs available.
   - Cycle 3: Replace 4 Improved techs with new ones from deck.
3. (Cycle 1: Skip) Adjust turn order:
   - Co-op/Solo: Optimize freely
   - Competitive: Reorder by ascending Influence (tie: reverse current order)
4. Draw Galactic Event card; place on space 4. Follow instructions (mandatory if solid border). Rx = number of Focus Phase rounds.

#### B. Focus Phase (Rx rounds)
Each round:
1. **Selection Step:**
   - Choose 1 Focus card from hand.
   - Optional:
     - Flip a Trade token to use all 3 actions.
     - Reveal an Agenda card with matching Focus icon to use its action.
2. **Actions Step:**
   - Perform ≤3 actions in any order.
   - Pay costs above actions.
   - Multi-effect actions: resolve in any order (green line = and/or; red line = or).
   - Can acquire technologies during actions.
3. **Cleanup Step:**
   - Recall Fleet Power so ≤2 ships per sector.
   - Reduce Glory tokens to ≤4.
   - Play or discard revealed Agenda card (no duplicates by type).
   - Return flipped Trade token to Galactic Board; place unflipped ones on Agenda cards or board.
   - Discard Focus card (remove Joint/Heroic cards from game).

#### C. Evaluation Phase
All players do steps in turn order:
1. **Voidborn Strike Back:**
   - Skirmish: Voidborn invades one non-Home sector per player.
   - Target must be adjacent to Voidborn sector.
   - Voidborn Power = player’s Civilization & Agenda corruption +1 (Cycle 2–3).
2. **Upkeep:**
   - Total Upkeep = Agenda card upkeep + occupied Guild/Installation slots.
   - Pay 1 Food **or** 2 Energy/Materials per Upkeep.
   - −3 Influence per unpaid Upkeep.
3. **Galactic Objectives:** Score from Event card.
4. **Agenda Objectives:** Score from uncorrupted Agenda cards.
5. **Retrieve Focus Cards:** Draw all discarded cards back into hand.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Fleet Power:**
  - Deployed in sectors; used in combat.
  - Active (ready) vs Inactive (reserve).
  - Split/merge same-type ships; total power conserved.
- **Combat:**
  - **Approach Step:** Simultaneous damage (e.g., Sector Defense = 1 damage).
  - **Salvo Step:**
    - Initiative determines order.
    - High initiative attacks first; if both survive, simultaneous attack.
    - Repeat until one side has no power.
  - **Absorption:** Use once per step unless specified.
- **Corruption:**
  - Can be on: Sectors (under pop die), Agenda slots, Civilization tracks, Agenda offer.
  - Effects:
    - Sectors: Cannot change population; don’t count for scoring.
    - Agenda/Civilization: Do not score benefits.
  - Removed via techs (e.g., Decontamination Chambers, Purifier).
- **Trade Tokens:**

- **Victory Conditions:**
