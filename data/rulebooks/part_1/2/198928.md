### 3. Setup  
1. **Board Setup**:  
   - Place hospitals, railroads, and purification tokens near the board.  
   - Place outbreak marker on "0" of the Outbreaks Track.  
   - Place infection rate marker on the leftmost "2" space.  
   - Place research markers near their indicators.  

2. **Infect Initial Cities**:  
   - Shuffle the 48 infection cards.  
   - Draw 9 cards:  
     - First 3: place 3 cubes of matching color in each city.  
     - Next 3: place 2 cubes.  
     - Last 3: place 1 cube.  
   - Discard these 9 cards face up to form the Infection Discard Pile. The rest is the Infection Deck.

3. **Player Roles & Pawns**:  
   - Shuffle 7 role cards; deal 1 to each player. Return unused roles to box.  
   - Give each player their matching pawn and reference card.  

4. **Player Deck Construction**:  
   - Separate player cards: 48 city, 15 event, 6 epidemic.  
   - Draw random number of event cards based on player count:  
     - 2P: 4 events  
     - 3P: 5 events  
     - 4P: 6 events  
     - 5P: 8 events  
   - Shuffle drawn events into the 48 city cards. Return unused events to box.  
   - Add epidemic cards based on difficulty:  
     - Introductory: 4 epidemics  
     - Standard: 5 epidemics  
     - Heroic: 6 epidemics  
   - Divide the deck into that many roughly equal piles. Shuffle one epidemic into each pile. Stack piles (smallest on bottom) to form the Player Deck.  

5. **Deal Starting Hands**:  
   - Deal cards:  
     - 2P: 4 cards each  
     - 3P: 3 cards each  
     - 4P/5P: 2 cards each  
   - Players place pawns in a city matching one of their city cards. If no city cards, choose any city.  

6. **First Player**:  
   - The player holding the city card with the earliest founding date starts.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, follow these steps in order:

#### 1. Do 4 Actions  
Choose any combination of the following (up to 4 total, repeatable):

- **Move by Carriage/Boat**: Move to adjacent city (connected by solid or dashed brown line). No card discard.  
- **Move by Train**: Move to any city connected via continuous railroad chain. No card discard.  
- **Move by Ship**: From a port city, discard a city card matching the **destination’s color** to move there.  
- **Build Railroad**: Place a railroad token on a **solid** line connected to your city. Cannot use dashed lines (e.g., to Andorra, Palma, Gibraltar). Requires token in supply.  
- **Build Hospital**: Discard the city card matching your current city. Place or move the matching-colored hospital there.  
- **Treat Disease**: Remove 1 disease cube from your city (return to supply). Applies even if disease is researched.  
- **Share Knowledge**:  
  - Give your current city’s card to another player in the same city, or  
  - Take it from them.  
  - Both players must agree. Recipient must not exceed 7 cards (discard or play event if needed).  
- **Research Disease**: At a city with a hospital, discard 5 city cards of the hospital’s color to research that disease. Cover with microscope marker.  
- **Purify Water**: Place 2 purification tokens in a region adjacent to your city. Do so by:  
  - Discarding a city card matching **any city bordering the region**, or  
  - Discarding a city card of a **researched disease** (any color, any region adjacent to you).  
  - Cannot perform if no purification tokens remain.

#### 2. Draw 2 Player Cards  
- Draw top 2 cards from Player Deck.  
- If fewer than 2 cards remain before drawing, **lose immediately**.  
- If an **Epidemic** is drawn, resolve it immediately (see below), then continue drawing if second card is not epidemic.  
- **Event cards** are kept in hand; no discard needed yet.  
- After resolving epidemics, check hand limit.

#### 3. Infect Cities  
- Draw number of infection cards equal to current **infection rate** (starting at 2).  
- Resolve one at a time:  
  - Reveal card, place 1 cube of matching color in that city.  
  - If a **purification token** is in a region adjacent to the city, remove 1 token instead of placing cube.  
  - If city already has 3 cubes of that color, **do not place cube** — trigger an **Outbreak**.  
- Discard each infection card to Infection Discard Pile.

#### Epidemic Resolution (when drawn)  
Resolve in order:

1. **Increase Infection Rate**: Move marker forward one space.  
2. **Infect**: Draw **bottom card** of Infection Deck. Place 3 cubes of matching color in that city.  
   - If city has 3 cubes, trigger **Outbreak** before placing.  
   - Each adjacent purification token prevents 1 cube (player chooses which token(s) to use).  
3. **Intensify**: Shuffle the Infection Discard Pile and place it on top of the Infection Deck.  
- Remove epidemic card from game.  
- Repeat for second epidemic if drawn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Outbreaks  
- Triggered when trying to place a 4th cube of a color in a city.  
- Advance outbreak marker by 1.  
- Place 1 cube of that color in each **adjacent city**.  
- If this would cause another 4th cube, trigger a **Chain Reaction Outbreak**.  
- **Chain Reaction Rule**: During chain outbreaks, do **not** add cubes to cities that already had an outbreak this turn.  
- If outbreak marker reaches 8, **team loses**.  

#### Purification Tokens  
- Prevent disease cube placement during infections.  
- Removed when preventing a cube.  
- Only one token can prevent one cube per infection.  
- Players choose which adjacent region’s token to remove if multiple are available.  

#### Hand Limit  
- Maximum hand size: **7 cards**.  
- After drawing cards (and resolving epidemics), discard or play events to reduce to 7.  
- Excess must be resolved before turn ends.

#### Event Cards  
- Can be played **anytime**, including other players’ turns, **except** between drawing and resolving an infection or epidemic card.  
- Playing an event is **not an action**.  
- Discard to Player Discard Pile after use.  
- Players may examine any discard pile at any time.

#### Role Abilities  
- **Agronomist**:  
  - May place 1 purification token (as action) in adjacent region.  
  - During Purify Water action, place **3 tokens** instead of 2.  
- **Politician**:  
  - May give a city card to any player (spend action); must be in city matching the card.  
  - May swap a hand card with one from discard pile (spend action); must be in city matching one of the two cards.  
- **Nurse**:  
  - Starts with a prevention token in an adjacent region.  
  - Cities adjacent to prevention token **cannot be infected**.  
  - Move prevention token to a new adjacent region whenever pawn moves.  
- **Railwayman**:  
  - Once per turn, may place **2 consecutive** railroads when building.  
  - When moving by train, may carry **1 passenger** (another pawn).  
- **Royal Academy Scientist**:  
  - May use **any city card** for Purify Water.  
  - May spend action to draw top 3 player cards, rearrange, and place back on top.

  - Move by ship **without discarding a card**.  
  - May carry **1 passenger** when moving by ship.

#### Historical Disease Variants (Optional)  
- **Malaria (Black)**: When infecting a city with **no black cubes**, place **2 cubes** instead of 1.  
- **Cholera (Blue)**: When blue outbreak occurs, also place 1 blue cube in cities **2 connections away** if they have **no cubes**.  
- **Typhus (Red)**: Requires **2 actions** to treat 1 red cube if city has >1 red cube.  
- **Yellow Fever (Yellow)**: When placing yellow cube in a **port city**, also place 1 yellow cube in **all adjacent port cities**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Win Condition**:  
- Immediately win when **all 4 diseases are researched**.

**Lose Conditions** (immediate loss):

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build a hospital if the matching hospital is already on the board?**  
  Yes. Move it from its current location to your city.  
- **Can I use a researched disease card to purify water in a region not adjacent to a city of that color?**  
  Yes. Only requirement is that the region is adjacent to your city.  
- **Can I play an event card between two epidemic resolutions?**  
  Yes. Events may be played between resolving first and second epidemic.  
- **Do purification tokens prevent cubes during epidemics?**  
  Yes. When infecting via epidemic (bottom card), purification tokens in adjacent regions can prevent up to 1 cube each.  
- **Can I treat more than one cube per turn?**  
  Yes, by using multiple "Treat Disease" actions. Rural Doctor can remove 2 cubes with 1 action.  
- **Can I move a hospital to a city without discarding a card?**  
  No. You must discard the matching city card to build or move a hospital.  
- **Can I have more than 7 cards temporarily?**  
  Yes, only after drawing cards and before resolving epidemics or discarding. Must reduce to 7 after epidemics.
