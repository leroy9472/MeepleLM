# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In the bustling bazaar district of Istanbul, players take on the role of merchants competing to be the first to collect a set number of rubies. Merchants and their assistants move through 16 distinct locations, performing actions to gather goods, money, and special abilities. The goal is to strategically manage movement and assistant placement to efficiently acquire rubies.

- **Win Condition**: First player to collect 5 rubies (6 in a 2-player game) triggers the end of the game.
- **Tiebreakers**: 1) Most leftover Lira, 2) Most leftover goods, 3) Most leftover Bonus cards.

## 2. Components
- 16 Place tiles (numbered 1–16)
- 5 Mosque tile stacks (by color: red, yellow, green, blue), each with varying goods requirements
- 1 Wheelbarrow per player with Goods indicators (cubes) for red, yellow, green, blue goods
- 1 Merchant disc, 5 Assistant discs, 1 Family Member disc per player
- 1 Overview card per player
- 4 Mail indicators
- 5 dark and 5 light Demand tiles
- 2 dice
- Lira coins (general supply)
- Bonus cards (quill-backed)
- Governor (purple) and Smuggler (black) tokens
- Rubies (used as victory points)

## 3. Setup
1. **Place Tiles**: Arrange the 16 Place tiles in a 4×4 grid. Recommended layouts:
   - *Short Paths*: Use blue numbers for shorter routes.
   - *Long Paths*: Use green numbers for longer routes.
   - *Random*: Shuffle tiles; Fountain must be in one of the four center positions; Tea House and Black Market must be at least 3 spaces apart.

2. **Mosque Tiles**:
   - Sort by color and by number of goods symbols (lowest on top).
   - Place red and green stacks on Small Mosque (14), blue and yellow on Great Mosque (15).
   - Player adjustments:
     - 5 players: 4 rubies per Mosque.
     - 3 players: Remove Mosque tiles with 5 goods.
     - 2 players: Remove tiles with 3 and 5 goods.

3. **Other Placements**:
   - Wainwright (1): 1 ruby and 3 Wheelbarrow extensions per player.
   - Sultan’s Palace (13) and Gemstone Dealer (16): Place rubies from top-right, filling one per player.
   - Post Office (5): 4 Mail indicators in top row.
   - Large Market (10): Shuffle dark Demand tiles, place face-up stack.
   - Small Market (11): Shuffle light Demand tiles, place face-up stack.

   - Bonus cards: Shuffle, place face-down stack next to board.

4. **Player Setup**:
   - Choose color; take matching components.
   - Place Goods indicators on leftmost (zero) spaces of Wheelbarrow.
   - Stack 4 Assistants with Merchant on top; place stack on Fountain (7).
   - Place Family Member on Police Station (12).
   - Draw 1 Bonus card.
   - Starting player receives 2 Lira; each next player receives +1 Lira (3, 4, etc.).

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Turns proceed clockwise. Each turn has four phases:

### 1. Movement
- Move Merchant and any Assistants 1 or 2 spaces orthogonally (no diagonals).
- Must end on a different tile than started.
- At destination:
  - **Pick Up Assistant**: If one of your Assistants is present, stack on top of it.
  - **Leave Assistant Behind**: If none present, remove bottom Assistant and leave it.
  - **Turn Ends**: If neither action possible (exception: Fountain).

*Yellow Mosque Tile*: Pay 2 Lira to retrieve an Assistant from another tile (enables leaving an Assistant).

### 2. Encounters with Other Merchants
- If other Merchants are present (not at Fountain), pay 2 Lira to each.
- Cannot pay? Turn ends immediately.
- *2-player exception*: Pay 2 Lira to general supply for neutral Merchants; roll dice to reposition them.

### 3. Action
- Perform the action of the current Place (optional).
- Only allowed if you picked up or left an Assistant in Phase 1.

### 4. Encounters (in any order)
- **Other Family Members**: Send to Police Station; take 1 Bonus card or 3 Lira per capture.
- **Governor**: Optionally draw 1 Bonus card. If so, pay 2 Lira or discard 1 Bonus card. Then roll dice; move Governor to matching tile.
- **Smuggler**: Optionally gain 1 good of choice. If so, pay 2 Lira or 1 good. Then roll dice; move Smuggler.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Assistant Management**: Assistants left behind block future actions unless retrieved. Plan routes to avoid being stranded.
- **Bonus Cards**: Play any number per turn. Discard to Caravansary. Draw from face-down deck (except at Caravansary, where top of discard pile may be used).
- **Mosque Tiles**:
  - **Red**: At Tea House or Black Market, turn one die to “4” or re-roll both.
  - **Green**: At any Warehouse, pay 2 Lira to gain 1 additional good of any type.
  - **Blue**: Immediately add 5th Assistant to your stack.
  - **Yellow**: Once per turn, pay 2 Lira to return an Assistant to your stack.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End**: When a player collects 5 rubies (6 in 2-player), finish the current round.
- Then, players may use leftover Bonus cards that provide goods or money (for tiebreakers).
- **Winner**: Most rubies.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Most Lira
  2. Most goods on Wheelbarrow
  3. Most Bonus cards in hand
  - If still tied, multiple winners.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
