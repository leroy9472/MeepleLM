## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   - Spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents represented by codenames.  
   - Operatives know only the codenames and must deduce which belong to their team.  
   - **Objective**: Be the first team to correctly identify all of your team’s agents.  
   - A team loses immediately if they guess the assassin.

2. **Components**  
   - 200 word cards (25 used per game)  
   - 40 key cards (1 used per game)  
   - Agent tiles:  
     - 8 red agent tiles  
     - 8 blue agent tiles  
     - 1 double agent tile (red on one side, blue on the other)  
   - 7 innocent bystander tiles  
   - 1 assassin tile  
   - Key card stand (optional, for display)  

3. **Setup**  
   - Split into two teams of at least two players each.  
   - Each team chooses one spymaster.  
   - Spymasters sit together on one side of the table; operatives sit opposite their spymaster.  
   - Randomly select 25 word cards and arrange them in a 5×5 grid.  
   - Randomly select one key card and insert it into the stand between the spymasters (any orientation).  
   - Place the 8 red agent tiles in front of the red spymaster; 8 blue agent tiles in front of the blue spymaster.  
   - Place the 7 bystander tiles and 1 assassin tile in the center.  
   - The double agent tile goes to the starting team (determined by colored lights on the edge of the key card) and is flipped to their color.  
     - The starting team must guess 9 words; the other team guesses 8.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   - Teams take turns, starting with the team indicated by the key card’s colored lights.  
   - On a team’s turn:  
     1. **Spymaster gives one clue**: a single word followed by a number (e.g., *tree: 2*).  
        - The clue must relate to the meaning of one or more of their team’s remaining words.  
        - The number indicates how many words the clue relates to.  
     2. **Operatives discuss and guess**:  
        - Must make at least one guess.  
        - Guess by touching one word card.  
        - If correct (their team’s agent), the spymaster covers it with their color tile; operatives may guess again.  
        - If incorrect:  
          - Bystander: turn ends.  
          - Opponent’s agent: turn ends; opponent gains progress.  
          - Assassin: game ends; guessing team loses.  
     3. **Operatives may continue guessing** as long as they are correct, up to the number of the clue + 1 (the “plus one” rule).  
     4. **Turn ends** when:  
        - A wrong guess is made.  
        - Operatives voluntarily stop.  
        - They exceed the clue number + 1 (unless using expert rules).  
   - Play alternates between teams until game end.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Valid Clues**:  
     - Must be one word (with exceptions below).  
     - Must relate to word meanings, not spelling, position, or letters.  
     - Cannot use any form (e.g., plural, tense) of a visible word.  
     - Cannot use part of a visible compound word (e.g., “horse” if “horseshoe” is visible).  
     - Must be in English; foreign words allowed only if commonly used in English (e.g., *strudel*).  
     - Letters/numbers allowed only if meaning-based (e.g., *X: 1* for *RAY*, *eight: 2* for *OCTOPUS* and *BALL*).  
   - **Spelling Clues**:  
     - Spymasters may spell out a clue if asked.  
     - Spelling is allowed even if it avoids homonym conflicts (e.g., *k-n-i-g-h-t* when *NIGHT* is visible).  
   - **Expert Rules (Optional)**:  
     - **Unlimited Clue**: Spymaster says *clue: unlimited*. Operatives may guess unlimited correct words.  
     - **Zero Clue**: Spymaster says *clue: 0*. Means “none of our words relate to this.” Operatives may guess unlimited times.  
   - **Invalid Clue Penalty**:  
     - Turn ends immediately.  
     - Opposing spymaster may cover one of their own uncovered words.  
     - If not noticed at the time, the clue stands.  
   - **Spymaster Conduct**:  
     - Must keep a straight face; no nonverbal cues.  
     - Must not reference unsolved clues or missed words.  
   - **Operative Conduct**:  
     - May discuss freely.  
     - May guess words from previous clues.  
     - Must guess one at a time.  

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - **Win Conditions**:  
     - A team wins when all their agent words are correctly guessed (covered).  
     - A team can win during the opponent’s turn if the opponent guesses their last word.  
   - **Lose Conditions**:  
     - A team loses immediately if they guess the assassin.  
   - **No formal scoring**; game is win/loss.  
   - For two-player cooperative variant: score based on number of enemy agents remaining (8 = “difficult to believe”, 1 = “a win is a win”).

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **What if a clue could relate to the assassin?**  
     - Spymasters should avoid this. If operatives guess it, their team loses.  
   - **Can you guess a word from a previous clue?**  
     - Yes, at any time, even on the first guess of a turn.  
   - **Can you end your turn early?**  
     - Yes, as long as at least one guess is made.  
   - **What if the clue number doesn’t match actual connections?**  
     - The number is a suggestion. If operatives guess a correct word not intended, the spymaster must treat it as valid.  
   - **Are homophones allowed?**  
     - Only if meaning-based (e.g., *snail: 1* for *MAIL*). Groups may allow soundalikes by agreement (e.g., *night: 1* for *KNIGHT*).  
   - **Are proper names, acronyms, or compound words allowed?**  
     - Only by group agreement. Examples:  
       - *NASA: 1* – allowed if agreed.  
       - *New York: 2* – allowed only if multiword clues are permitted.  
       - *greenhouse: 1* – allowed (one word).  
       - *mother-in-law: 1* – not allowed unless agreed.
