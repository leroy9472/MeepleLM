## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Ticket to Ride Europe is a railway-themed board game where players build train routes across Europe. The objective is to score the most points by completing destination tickets, claiming routes, building stations, and achieving the longest continuous route.

2. Components  
- Train cars (45 per player, in player colors)  
- Train stations (3 per player)  
- Train cards (8 colors + Locomotive/wild)  
- Destination tickets (regular and 6 long-route tickets with blue background)  
- Scoring marker for each player  
- Game board showing European cities and routes  
- European Express bonus card (for longest continuous route)

3. Setup  
- Each player chooses a color and takes 45 trains, 3 stations, and a scoring marker.  
- Place scoring markers at "0" on the score track.  
- Shuffle train card deck and deal 4 cards to each player.  
- Flip 5 train cards face-up.  
- Shuffle long-route tickets (blue), deal 1 to each player; return extras to box.  
- Shuffle regular destination tickets, deal 3 to each player.  
- Each player must keep at least 2 of their 4 total destination tickets (1 long + 3 regular). Discard unkept tickets to box.  
- Place European Express bonus card near the board.  
- Determine starting player (e.g., player who visited most European countries). Play proceeds clockwise.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a turn, a player performs exactly one of these actions:  
1. **Draw 2 Train Cards**  
   - Take either:  
     - 2 from the face-up cards (one at a time, replacing each immediately), or  
     - 2 from the top of the deck (blind draw), or  
     - 1 face-up and 1 blind from deck.  
   - If a face-up Locomotive is taken as the first card, the turn ends (only 1 card drawn).  
   - If a Locomotive is drawn from the deck, the player may still take a second card.  
   - If 3 face-up cards are Locomotives, discard all 5 face-up cards and replace with 5 new ones.  
2. **Claim a Route**  
   - Play train cards matching the color and length of an unclaimed route.  
   - Gray routes can be claimed with any single color (including Locomotives as wilds).  
   - Place one train car per space on the route.  
   - Score points immediately based on route length:  
     1 space = 1 point, 2 = 2, 3 = 4, 4 = 7, 5 = 10, 6 = 15, 8 = 21.  
   - A player may only claim one route per turn.  
   - Double routes: Only one of the two parallel routes may be claimed by a single player. In 2-3 player games, only one of the two routes is usable.  
3. **Draw 3 Destination Tickets**  
   - Draw 3 tickets from the deck.  
   - Must keep at least 1; return unkept tickets to the bottom of the deck.  
   - Tickets remain secret until endgame.  
4. **Build a Train Station**  
   - Place a station in any unoccupied city.  
   - Cost:  
     - 1st station: 1 train card (any color)  
     - 2nd station: 2 matching color cards (Locomotives may be used)  
     - 3rd station: 3 matching color cards (Locomotives may be used)  
   - A station allows the owner to use one opponent's route connected to that city when completing destination tickets.

Special Route Types:  
- **Ferries**: Gray routes with Locomotive symbols. Each Locomotive symbol requires one Locomotive card. Remaining spaces require cards of one chosen color.  
- **Tunnels**: Routes with black borders. After playing required cards, reveal top 3 cards from train deck. For each revealed card matching the route color (or Locomotive), play one additional card of that color (or Locomotive). If unable or unwilling, take cards back and end turn.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Players build networks of connected routes.  
- Destination tickets require connecting two cities (directly or via other routes).  
- Stations allow borrowing one opponent's route per station to complete tickets.  
- Locomotive cards are wilds for color-matching.  
- Players may not claim both routes in a double-route; in 2-3 player games, only one route is available.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Game Trigger**: When a player has 2 or fewer trains left after their turn, each player (including that player) takes one final turn.  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - **Claimed Routes**: Points scored during play (see route length table).  
  - **Destination Tickets**: Add points for completed tickets; subtract points for uncompleted ones.  
  - **Longest Continuous Route**: +10 points (European Express bonus). Only player's own trains count; stations and borrowed routes do not. Ties: all tied players receive 10 points.  
  - **Unused Stations**: +4 points per unplayed station.  
- **Winning**: Highest total score wins. Tiebreakers:  
  1. Most completed destination tickets.  
  2. Fewest stations used.  
  3. Possession of European Express bonus.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I draw 2 face-up Locomotives?** No. Taking one face-up Locomotive ends the turn.  
- **Can I use a station to extend my longest route?** No. Only player's own trains count for the longest route.  
- **Can I use the same borrowed route for multiple tickets?** Yes, if connected via the same station.  
- **What if train deck runs out?** Reshuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
- **Can I claim a route longer than my remaining trains?** Yes, as long as you have enough trains to place.  
- **Can I build a station on a city with no routes?** Yes, but it must connect to an opponent's route to be useful.  
- **What if I can’t pay extra cards for a tunnel?** Take back your cards, turn ends, no penalty.
