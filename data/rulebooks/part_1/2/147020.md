### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has three phases:  
1. **Main Phase**  
2. **Discard Phase**  
3. **Draw Phase**  

#### 1. Main Phase  
During this phase, perform any of the following in any order, any number of times:  
- Play cards from hand  
- Use abilities of in-play Ships and Bases  
- Acquire cards from Trade Row or Explorer pile  
- Attack opponent(s) or Bases  

**Playing Cards**:  
- No cost to play. Place in front of you.  
- **Ships**: Trigger Primary Ability immediately. Remain in play until Discard Phase.  
- **Bases**: Stay in play until destroyed or scrapped. Have Defense value.  

**Abilities**:  
- **Primary Ability**: Triggers immediately when Ship is played.  
- **Base Primary Ability**: May be used when played or any time during Main Phase.  
- **Ally Ability**: Triggered when another card of the same faction is in play. Can be used once per turn.  
- **Double-Ally**: Triggered when two other cards of the same faction are in play.  
- **Scrap Ability**: Optional. Remove card from play to Scrap Heap to trigger effect.  

**Acquiring Cards**:  
- Spend Trade from Trade Pool equal to card’s cost.  
- Acquired cards go to discard pile.  
- Free acquisition (e.g., “Acquire a card”) bypasses cost.  
- Replace acquired or scrapped Trade Row cards immediately.  

**Attacking**:  
- Spend Combat from Combat Pool.  
- **Attack Opponent**: Reduce their Authority by Combat spent.  
- **Destroy Base**: Spend Combat ≥ Base’s Defense in a single turn.  
- **Outposts**: Must destroy all Outposts before targeting player or non-Outpost Bases.  

#### 2. Discard Phase  
- Lose unspent Trade and Combat  
- Discard all in-play Ships to discard pile  
- Discard all remaining hand cards  

#### 3. Draw Phase  
- Draw 5 cards. Reshuffle discard pile if deck is empty.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Trade**: Used to buy cards. Expires at end of turn.  
- **Combat**: Used to attack. Expires at end of turn.  
- **Authority**: Health. Start at 50. Reduce opponent to 0 to win.  
- **Outposts**: Defensive Bases. Must be destroyed first before attacking player or other Bases.  
- **Scrapping**: Permanent removal. Only Scrap Ability grants benefit.  
- **Factions**: Ally/Double-Ally abilities scale with faction synergy.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition**: Reduce opponent(s) to 0 Authority.  
- **Multiplayer Variants**:  
  - **Free-for-All**: Last player alive wins.  
  - **Hunter**: Attack only left opponent. Last alive wins.  
  - **Hydra**: Team shares Authority. Last team standing wins.  
  - **Emperor**: Admirals attack only enemy Emperor. Eliminate enemy Emperor to win.  
  - **Raid**: Boss vs. Raiders. Boss wins if all Raiders defeated; Raiders win if Boss is reduced to 0.  
- **Solo/Co-op**: Use Challenge cards or AI opponents.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Empty Deck During Draw**: Shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
- **Trade Row Maintenance**: Always keep 5 cards. Replace immediately when card is acquired or scrapped.  
- **Multiple Outposts**: All must be destroyed before targeting non-Outpost Bases or player.  
- **Team Games (Hydra/Emperor)**:  
  - Trade may be pooled for purchases.  
  - Combat cannot be pooled.  
  - Outposts protect entire team.  
- **Ally Abilities**: Triggered as soon as condition is met, even mid-action.  
- **Scrap Heap vs Discard**: Scrapped cards are removed from game; discard pile cards re-enter via shuffle.  
- **Explorer Scrapping**: When scrapped, return to Explorer pile, not Scrap Heap.
