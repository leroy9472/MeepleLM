## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Welcome To…*, players are 1950s American architects competing to design the most desirable suburban neighborhoods during the Baby Boom era. The goal is to develop three streets by building houses, completing city plans, and enhancing property value through parks, pools, and other upgrades. Victory is achieved by scoring the most points through strategic placement of house numbers and effective use of card effects.

### 2. Components  
- 100 player sheets (each with 3 streets of houses, scoring tracks, and estate markers)  
- 29 City Plan cards (18 basic, 10 advanced, 1 solo)  
- 81 Construction cards (house number on one side, effect on the back)  
- 4 player aids (reference sheets)  
- Pens or pencils (not included)  

**Construction Card Distribution:**  
- **By Effect:**  
  - 18 Surveyor (White Fence)  
  - 18 Real Estate Agent (Purple Coins)  
  - 18 Landscaper (Green Park)  
  - 9 Pool Manufacturer (Blue Pool)  
  - 9 Temp Agency (Orange Road Block)  
  - 9 “Bis” (Red Mailbox)  
- **By House Number (frequency in deck):**  
  - 3×: 1, 2, 14, 15  
  - 4×: 3, 13  
  - 5×: 4, 12  
  - 6×: 5, 11  
  - 7×: 6, 10  
  - 8×: 7, 9  
  - 9×: 8  

### 3. Setup  
- Each player takes:  
  - 1 player sheet  
  - 1 pen/pencil  
  - 1 player aid  
- Randomly select 3 City Plan cards: one #1, one #2, one #3 (basic set). Place them "Project" side up.  
- Shuffle the 81 Construction cards and deal into 3 face-up stacks of 27 cards each (house number side up). Leave space to the right for discard piles.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn proceeds simultaneously:  
1. **Reveal Cards:** Flip the top card of each of the 3 stacks to reveal a house number and its associated effect. These form 3 available combinations.  
2. **Choose Action:** Each player selects one of the three combinations. Multiple players may choose the same.  
3. **Place House Number:** Write the house number in any empty house on your sheet, following:  
   - Numbers must increase **left to right** on each street.  
   - Skipping numbers is allowed.  
   - Gaps between houses are allowed and can be filled later.  
   - **Exception:** “Bis” effect allows adjacent duplicates.  
4. **Building Permit Refusal:** If you **cannot legally place** the number (no valid spot), you do **not** place a number and instead take a **Building Permit Refusal** (cross off top red hexagon).  
5. **Perform Effect (Optional):** If you placed a number (i.e., did **not** take a refusal), you may **optionally** use the card’s effect.  
6. **Discard & Repeat:** Discard used cards. Next turn, flip new cards from the stacks. If stacks empty, reshuffle and redealt.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
**Effects (Optional unless otherwise noted):**  
- **Surveyor (White Fence):**  
  - Place a fence between any two houses on any street (dotted line).  
  - Fences define **estates** (group of houses between two fences).  
  - Permanent fences exist at both ends of each street.  
- **Real Estate Agent (Purple Coins):**  
  - Cross off the lowest unmarked space in a purple estate-size column (2-house, 3-house, etc.).  
  - Scoring: Each completed estate of size N scores points equal to the **lowest unmarked number** in that column.  
- **Landscaper (Green Park):**  
  - Cross off the **leftmost** park number on the **same street** where you placed a number.  
  - Scoring: Score equals lowest unmarked park value per street.  
- **Pool Manufacturer (Blue Pool):**  
  - If you placed a number in a house **with a pool icon**, you may:  
    - Circle the pool  
    - Cross off the lowest unmarked pool box  
  - Scoring: Score equals lowest unmarked pool value.  
- **Temp Agency (Orange Road Block):**  
  - You may **adjust the house number by ±0, ±1, or ±2** (e.g., use 8 as 6–10).  
  - Optionally, cross off one orange Temp box (even if adjustment is 0).  
  - **Endgame:** Most Temp boxes → 7 VP, second → 4 VP, third → 1 VP (ties share rank).  
- **Bis (Red Mailbox):**  
  - After placing a number, you may **duplicate an adjacent number** (left or right).  
  - Write “bis” next to it.  
  - Cannot cross fences.  
  - Cross off lowest unmarked Bis box.  
  - **Endgame:** Subtract lowest unmarked Bis value from score.  
- **Roundabout (Bonus Action, 2x per game):**  
  - Draw a circle+dot in an empty house to create a roundabout.  
  - Splits the street: numbering can restart on either side.  
  - Cross off a roundabout box (first costs 3 pts, second 5 pts).  
  - **Endgame:** Subtract lowest unmarked roundabout value.  

**City Plans:**  
- Each card has a goal and two scores: higher on "Project" side, lower on "Approved" side.  
- First player to fulfill a City Plan:  
  - Scores high value  
  - Flips card to "Approved"  
  - May **reshuffle** the deck  
- Subsequent players who complete it score the lower "Approved" value.  
- Once used, an estate **cannot** be reused for another plan (mark fences to track).  
- Exception: A pool used in a plan does **not** invalidate its house for other plans.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game Ends Immediately When:**  
- A player builds **all houses** on their sheet.  
- A player completes **all 3 City Plans**.  
- A player takes their **3rd Building Permit Refusal**.  

**Final Scoring:**  
Add:  
- City Plan points (n1, n2, n3)  
- Parks: lowest unmarked value **per street**  
- Pools: lowest unmarked value  
- Estates: for each **fully completed** estate (all houses numbered), multiply size by lowest unmarked value in corresponding Real Estate column  
- Temp Agency: 7/4/1 based on rank  

Subtract:  
- Bis: lowest unmarked value  
- Building Permit Refusals: lowest unmarked red hexagon value  
- Roundabouts: lowest unmarked value (if used)  

**Tiebreakers:**  
1. Most completed estates  
2. Most 1-house estates, then 2-house, etc.  
3. Play again  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use Temp Agency to go below 1 or above 17?**  
  No. Valid range is **1–17** (0 is not allowed).  
- **Can I place a number with “Bis” without using the duplicate?**  
  Yes. Writing the number is mandatory; using “Bis” is optional.  
- **Can I use a Pool effect on a non-pool house?**  
  Yes, but you cannot mark a pool.  
- **Can I build a fence after completing a City Plan?**  
  Yes, unless the estate was **used** for a plan — then it’s locked.  
- **Can roundabouts be adjacent?**  
  Yes, as long as they’re in separate houses.  
- **Do I have to use the same card’s number and effect?**  
  Yes — you choose one combo (number + effect), use the number to place, and optionally use that card’s effect.
