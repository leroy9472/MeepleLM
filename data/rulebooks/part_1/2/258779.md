## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Earth has run out of resources. One to six players (planeters) have been selected to develop an unknown planet to preserve humanity.  
The objective is to score the most victory points (medals) through efficient planet development, resource track advancement, collecting lifepods, removing meteorites, and outperforming neighboring planets.

2. Components  
- 1 Space Station (SUSAN)  
- 144 Polyomino Tiles  
- 6 Planet Boards (symmetric and asymmetric sides)  
- 6 Corporation Boards (symmetric and asymmetric sides)  
- 60+ Meteorites (orange)  
- 60+ Biomass Patches (green)  
- 36+ Lifepods  
- 30 Resource Trackers (6 colors × 5 per player)  
- 14 Rovers (white)  
- 12 Depot Indicators (triangles)  
- 28 Objective Cards (neighbor and private sides)  
- 60 Event Cards (20 green, 20 orange, 20 red)  
- 1 Scorepad  
- 1 Yellow Commander Token  
- 1 Flux Token (optional)  
- 1 Station Commander Token (same as yellow commander token)

3. Setup  
1. Place the Space Station (SUSAN) in the center. Load each depot with two stacks of 12 tiles: small (interior ring), large (exterior ring). All tiles in a stack must be same shape and orientation.  
2. Each player takes:  
   - 1 Planet Board  
   - 1 Corporation Board  
   - 5 Resource Trackers (black/Civ, blue/Water, green/Biomass, red/Rover, white/Tech)  
   - Matching colored rovers and lifepods as indicated on boards  
   - 2 depot indicators (triangles) of their color  
3. Place blue lifepods on designated blue circles on the Planet Board.  
4. Place white rovers at the bottom-left of the Corporation Board (one per rover icon).  
5. Place one depot indicator triangle next to SUSAN, pointing to the player’s “slice” (depot).  
6. Randomly select Civ Cards: (number of players + 1) cards per rank (1–4). Form 4 face-down stacks by rank. Return unused cards to box.  
7. Place meteorites and biomass patches within reach.  
8. Shuffle and deal Objective Cards:  
   - 2 players: 3 face-up neighbor objectives (between players, neighbor side up)  
   - 3+ players: 1 face-up neighbor objective between each adjacent pair  
   - Optional: Use Private Objective Module — each player chooses 1 of 2 dealt private objectives  
9. Optional: Set up Event Deck (20 cards total, mix of green/orange/red). Shuffle and place face down.  
10. Give the yellow Commander Token to a starting player.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds simultaneously:  
1. **Commander Phase**: The player with the Commander Token may rotate SUSAN so any depot aligns with their triangle. Rotation is optional.  
   - If Event Deck is used: Draw and resolve top card immediately after rotation.  
2. **Draft Phase**: All players simultaneously take one of the two tiles from their depot (the one in their “slice”).  
   - If both tile stacks in a depot are empty, game ends after this round.  
   - If a player cannot legally place either tile, they still choose one, gain resource advancements, but do not place it. Game ends after this round.  
3. **Placement Phase**: Place the chosen tile on your Planet Board:  
   - First tile must touch the perimeter.  
   - Subsequent tiles must be orthogonally adjacent to an existing tile.  
   - Tiles cannot overlap, go outside grid, or stack.  
   - Must align with grid.  
   - If tile covers a lifepod or rover, it is destroyed and removed.  
   - If tile has a meteor symbol, place a meteorite on it.  
4. **Resource Advancement Phase**: For each resource on the placed tile, advance the corresponding tracker on your Corporation Board by 1.  
   - Energy has no tracker. Instead, advance:  
     a) The non-energy resource on the tile, OR  
     b) Any resource from terrain orthogonally adjacent to the energy terrain.  
   - Water tracker only advances if at least one water square covers planetary ice.  
   - If a tracker is at the top, no benefit is gained (except Rover — always gains movement).  
5. **Claim Benefits**: For each tracker advanced:  
   - Claim synergy boosts (immediately): Advance any one tracker by 1.  
   - Claim milestone benefits:  
     - **Civ**: On a Civ Milestone, take all available Civ cards of that rank. Keep one, return others face down.  
       - “Immediate” bonuses: take now.  
       - “End Game” bonuses: keep secret until end.  
       - Tie for milestone: choose clockwise starting with Commander.  
     - **Water**: No milestone. Only medals and synergy.  
     - **Biomass**: On milestone, take and immediately place a Biomass Patch (follows normal placement rules).  
     - **Rover**: On milestone, gain a rover and place it on your last-placed tile. Then move rovers total number of squares indicated by rover tracker (can split between rovers).  
       - Collect meteorites/lifepods by moving rover onto or through them. Place on corporation board for end-game points.  
       - Rovers move orthogonally on tiles or grid. Can backtrack.  
     - **Tech**: On milestone, unlock corresponding tech ability (permanent unless otherwise stated). Examples:  
       - Universal Coalition:  
         - Lvl 1: Ignore adjacency rules  
         - Lvl 2: Store biomass patches until end  
         - Lvl 3: +1 rover movement  
         - Lvl 4: Double water advancement  
         - Lvl 5: Immune to meteorites  
6. **Pass Commander Token**: After all actions, pass Commander Token clockwise. Begin next round.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Tile Placement**: Must follow perimeter-first and adjacency rules.  
- **Resource Tracking**:  
  - Trackers start at 0. Advance on placement.  
  - Medals scored at end based on highest medal reached or passed.  
  - Synergy boosts: immediate +1 to any tracker.  
- **Energy**: Flexible advancement — choose from adjacent non-energy resource or adjacent terrain.  
- **Rover Movement**: Gained from rover tracker milestones. Can be split. Collects components.  
- **Tech Unlocking**: Permanent abilities when reaching Tech milestones.  
- **Civ Cards**: Milestone-based drafting. Strategic selection.  
- **Meteorites**: Block row/column scoring where placed.  
- **Biomass Patches**: Help complete rows/columns. Do not advance Biomass track.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends when:  
- A player cannot legally place either of their two depot tiles (after placing that round).  
- One depot is completely emptied.  
- Optional: Last Event Card is drawn and resolved.  

All players finish the round. Then score:  
Total Medals = Final Score  
A. **Planet Rows/Columns**: 1VP, 2VP, or 3VP per complete row/column (based on medal indicator), **only if no meteorite or empty square** in the row/column.  
B. **Resource Trackers**: Score highest medal value each tracker has reached or passed.  
C. **Collected Components**:  
   - 1 medal per lifepod collected  
   - 1 medal per 3 meteorites collected (round down)  
D. **Civ Cards**: Score medals from cards labeled “End Game”  
E. **Private Objectives** (if used): Score if completed  
F. **Neighbor Objectives**: Compare with adjacent neighbors. Score medals if you win or tie.  

Tiebreakers (in order):  
1. Fewest uncovered squares on planet  
2. Fewest meteorites on planet  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I pick up a tile to test fit?** Yes, but others may see the tile below. House rule recommended if abused.  
- **Can I flip the tile?** Yes. Both sides identical.  
- **Which tracker to advance first?** Player’s choice. Can matter for synergy or tech timing.  
- **What if a tracker blocks another?** (e.g., Oasis Ultd.) — Some asymmetric corps have irregular tracks. May block advancement unless tech allows bypass.  
- **Can rovers move diagonally?** No. Only orthogonally.  
- **What if no rover is available at milestone?** Gain movement but cannot place rover.  
- **Event card triggers end?** Ignore the card’s effect if it solely causes game end.  
- **Asymmetric rules block play?** Ignore restriction if it solely causes game end.
