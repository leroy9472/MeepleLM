## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Undaunted: Normandy, players command a rifle platoon during the 1944 Allied invasion of Normandy. Each scenario presents a unique battlefield where players must achieve specific objectives—either by capturing and controlling key tiles or by pinning the enemy by eliminating all their Riflemen units. The game captures the chaos and tactical decisions of WWII combat, emphasizing reconnaissance, suppression, and strategic card play.

2. Components  
- 54 US cards and 54 German cards  
- 11 US and 11 German combat counters  
- 4 US and 5 German spawn markers  
- 1 US and 1 German target marker  
- 18 US and 18 German control markers  
- 1 radio marker (used in specific scenarios)  
- 1 initiative marker  
- 18 board tiles (with A/B sides)  
- 14 objective markers  
- 4 ten-sided dice (d10)

3. Setup  
1. Choose a scenario from the scenario book.  
2. Place board tiles as specified, using the correct side (A or B).  
3. Place objective markers as directed.  
4. Place the radio marker if required by the scenario.  
5. Players choose a side and take all associated cards, combat counters, control markers, and spawn markers.  
6. Place tokens (combat counters, control markers, spawn markers) on designated spaces.  
7. Assign the initiative marker as specified.  
8. Assemble starting decks: Shuffle cards marked "D" in the scenario’s Starting Cards table.  
9. Assemble supply: Place cards marked "S" face-up nearby, sorted by title.  
10. Return unused cards and markers to the box.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:  
1. Draw Cards: Both players draw 4 cards from their deck. If the deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.  
2. Determine Initiative: Each player secretly selects one card from their hand. Reveal simultaneously; the higher initiative value wins the initiative marker. In case of a tie, the current holder keeps it. Both cards are discarded.  
3. Player Turns: The player with initiative plays first. On their turn, a player may:  
   - Play a card to perform one of its actions, or  
   - Hunker Down (return the card to supply).  
   Cards are played one at a time into a play area. Turn ends when the player has no cards left or chooses to stop. All cards in hand and play area are discarded. The other player then takes their turn.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Combat Cards**: Represent soldiers; associated with a combat counter. Include title, initiative, squad, actions, and name.  
- **Command Cards**: Represent leaders; not tied to a counter. Have command stars and special actions.  
- **Fog of War Cards**: Can only be used to bid for initiative; removed from the deck via the Recon action.  
- **Control Markers**: Mark tiles as scouted (visible) or controlled (owned). Only controlled tiles count toward objectives.  
- **Suppression**: A suppressed unit (counter face-down) cannot take actions. Playing its card flips it to ready (face-up) but does not allow an action.  
- **Placing Combat Counters**: When playing a combat card whose counter is not on the board, place it on the appropriate spawn marker before performing the action.  
- **Hunker Down**: Return a card to supply, removing it from the deck until bolstered. Cannot be done with Fog of War cards.

**Action Types**  
- **Movement Actions**  
  - Move X: Move unit up to X tiles; destination must be scouted or controlled. Moving Mortar removes target marker.  
  - Guide X: Move any ready unit up to X tiles; same restrictions as Move.  
  - Scout X: Move up to X tiles. Place scouted marker on uncontrolled tiles entered; take one Fog of War card per marker placed.  
  - Stalk X: Move up to X tiles; no scouting required.  
- **Support Actions**  
  - Bolster X|A: Add up to X cards from supply to discard pile. If squad specified, only that squad’s cards.  
  - Command X: Draw up to X cards into hand (can be played this turn).  
  - Conceal: Take one Fog of War card from opponent’s supply and place in their discard.  
  - Control: Flip control marker on current tile to controlled side. Cannot if enemy unit occupies the tile.  
  - Inspire X|A: Return up to X cards from play area to hand. Squad restriction applies if specified.  
  - Recon: Remove a Fog of War card from your hand; draw one card (can be played this turn).  
  - Target: Place or move target marker to a tile at least 3 tiles from Mortar. Moving Mortar removes target.  
- **Combat Actions**  
  - Attack X / Suppress X / Blast X:  
    1. Choose Target: Attack/Suppress—any enemy unit; Blast—all units on tile with target marker (including friendly).  
    2. Determine Total Defence: Base defence (on counter) + cover bonus (on tile) + range (number of tiles from attacker, not for Blast).  
    3. Roll Dice: Roll X d10. If any die ≥ total defence, attack succeeds. Die showing 0 always succeeds.  
    4. Determine Casualties:  
       - Attack/Blast: Opponent removes one card of the unit (hand > discard > deck > remove counter).  
       - Suppress: Flip target counter to suppressed. No effect if already suppressed.  
- **Hills**: Tiles with cover bonus "3/1". Cover is 1 if attacker is on a hill, same tile, or attack is Blast; otherwise, cover is 3.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory Conditions** (scenario-specific):  
  - **Capturing Objectives**: Control enough objective points as specified.  
  - **Pinning the Enemy**: Opponent has no Riflemen combat counters on the board.  
- **Game End**: As soon as a victory condition is met, the game ends immediately.  
- **Tiebreaker**: If both sides are pinned, the player with more objective points wins. Tie: player with initiative wins.  
- **Beyond All Hope**: If a player cannot win by objectives, they count as pinned. Opponent wins immediately if their goal is to pin; otherwise, they win if they control more objectives, or the game continues until one does.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Fog of War cards cannot be played during a turn, only used for initiative.  
- Recon removes one Fog of War from hand and draws a card. Cannot be done without a Fog of War in hand.  
- Moving a Mortar removes the target marker. Target must be re-established.  
- Control action cannot be taken if enemy unit occupies the tile.  
- Only one card is removed per successful attack, regardless of dice.  
- Combat counters return via spawn markers, not original location.  
- Initiative marker breaks ties in initiative bids.
