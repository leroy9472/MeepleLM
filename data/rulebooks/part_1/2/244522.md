## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Players aim to score the highest number of points by cleverly using dice rolls across five colored areas on their individual score sheets. Strategic selection of dice and attention to opponents’ choices are key. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

2. **Components**  
- 1 Scoring Pad (with individual score sheets)  
- 6 Dice (yellow, blue, green, orange, purple, white)  
- 4 Felt Pens  

3. **Setup**  
- Each player receives a score sheet and a pen.  
- Determine a starting player randomly; they take all six dice.  
- The number of rounds depends on player count:  
  - 4 players: 4 rounds  
  - 3 players: 5 rounds  
  - 1–2 players: 6 rounds  
- At the start of each of the first four rounds, each player receives one bonus as indicated on the round tracker (in round 4, players choose one of two options).

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
- The game proceeds in rounds. Each round, every player takes one turn as the **Active Player**.  
- On a player’s turn as Active Player:  
  1. Roll all six dice.  
  2. Choose one die, place it on a free dice field on the score sheet, and resolve its effect in the corresponding color area.  
  3. Move all dice showing a lower value than the chosen die to the **Silver Platter** (dice on the platter are out of reach for the active player, except via Extra Die action).  
  4. Repeat steps 2–3 up to two more times with remaining dice (second and third rolls).  
  5. After the third roll (or when no dice remain to roll), place all unused dice not on the score sheet onto the Silver Platter.  
- After the Active Player finishes, all other players (Passive Players) simultaneously choose one die from the Silver Platter to use on their own sheets.  
- If a Passive Player cannot use any die from the Silver Platter, they may instead use one die from the Active Player’s dice fields.  
- The turn passes clockwise; the next player becomes Active Player.  
- A round ends when all players have been the Active Player once.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **White Die (Joker):**  
  - Can be used as any color (yellow, green, orange, purple).  
  - Or, combined with the blue die: add white die’s value to blue die (or vice versa) to mark a number in the blue area.  
  - Applies to all players, regardless of die location.  
- **Yellow Area:**  
  - Mark any one matching number (each number appears twice; only one per roll).  
  - Any order allowed.  
  - When a column is fully marked, circle the star value at the bottom—this is scored at game end.  
- **Blue Area:**  
  - Mark a number equal to the sum of the blue die and white die (whichever is used first).  
  - Any order allowed.  
  - Final score based on number of marks: use the point scale at the top (e.g., 9 marks = 37 points).  
- **Green Area:**  
  - Fill boxes left to right, no skipping.  
  - Die value must be ≥ the minimum shown in the next box.  
  - Score: white star number above the last filled box.  
- **Orange Area:**  
  - Fill boxes left to right, no skipping.  
  - Record die value; some boxes have multipliers (e.g., x2, x3).  
  - Score: sum of all recorded numbers.  
- **Purple Area:**  
  - Fill boxes left to right, no skipping.  
  - Each number must be higher than the previous, **except** after a 6—any number may follow.  
  - Score: sum of all recorded numbers.  
- **Actions:**  
  - Unlocked by completing certain fields, columns, or rows.  
  - Mark with a circle when unlocked; cross out when used.  
  - **Reroll Action (Active Player only):** Reroll all currently rolled dice (not on sheet or platter). Must reroll all available dice.  
  - **Extra Die Action:** At end of turn (after regular die selection), use any one die again. Can use multiple times per turn, but each die only once per turn this way.  
- **Bonuses:**  
  - Triggered immediately when applicable.  
  - **X-Bonus:** Immediately mark one box in the corresponding color (any in yellow/blue; next in green).  
  - **Number Bonus (e.g., 4, 5, 6):** Immediately record that number in the next available box in the corresponding area (orange/purple).  
  - **Round 4 Bonuses:**  
    - Black X: Use as X-bonus in yellow, blue, or green.  
    - Black 6: Record a 6 in the next available orange or purple box.  
  - Bonuses can chain: triggering one bonus may unlock another.  
- **Foxes:**  
  - Each fox scores points equal to the player’s lowest-scoring colored area.  
  - If any area scores 0, all foxes score 0.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- Game ends after the last Passive Player completes their action in the final round.  
- Players may use remaining Extra Die actions; unused Reroll actions expire.  
- Final scoring:  
  - Score each of the five colored areas:  
    - Yellow: sum of circled column stars.  
    - Blue: use point scale based on number of marks.  
    - Green: star above last filled box.  
    - Orange: sum of all numbers.  
    - Purple: sum of all numbers.  
  - Foxes: number of foxes × value of lowest-scoring area.  
- Total all area scores and fox bonus.  
- **Winning:** Highest total wins.  
  - Tiebreaker: highest score in a single area.  
  - If still tied, share the victory.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Active Player cannot use a die:** If no legal move (e.g., purple die too low), the roll is skipped (counts as one of three rolls).  
- **Passive Player cannot use Silver Platter die:** May use any die from the Active Player’s dice fields.  
- **Choosing high die early:** May leave no dice for subsequent rolls (fewer than three rolls possible).  
- **Multiple players using same die:** Allowed—dice on Silver Platter remain available to all.  
- **White and Blue interaction:** Always add both values when using either die in blue area. Cannot use just one.  
- **Bonus chaining:** All triggered bonuses must be resolved immediately.  
- **Solo Play:**  
  - 6 rounds. Player alternates as Active and Passive Player.  
  - As Passive Player: roll all six dice, place three lowest on Silver Platter (tiebreaker: die closest to platter).  
  - No actions may be used during Passive Player phase.
