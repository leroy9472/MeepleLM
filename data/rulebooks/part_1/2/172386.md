## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
As an investor in colonial Africa, you aim to earn the most money (pounds) over 7 rounds by investing in four chartered companies based in Mombasa, Cape Town, Saint-Louis, and Cairo. Players expand company trading posts across the continent, acquire shares, and increase share value by uncovering coin icons on company bases.

### 3. Setup
**Board Setup:**
1. Place the game board in the center.
2. Shuffle the 4 track cards and place one face-down next to each edge of the board, arrow pointing to the edge. Reveal and place the corresponding company track (A, B, C, D).
3. Place 15 trading posts of each color on their respective company base, covering all spaces.
4. Sort action cards by letter (E to A), shuffle each pile, then stack E on bottom, D on top, etc., with A on top. Do not shuffle the full deck.
5. Fill the 12-card display: right column first (top to bottom), then middle, then left.
6. Fill round track spaces 2–7 with coins:
   - 2 players: 1 coin per space
   - 3 players: 2 coins on spaces 2, 4, 6; 1 coin on 3, 5, 7
   - 4 players: 2 coins per space
7. Sort book tiles by letter, reveal 4 of each (A/B/C) and place in the book display.
8. Place 4 bonus tiles face-up beside the board.

**Player Setup:**
1. Each player takes:

4. Place the 3 cards shown on the starting tile into the 3 resting slots above the player board (any order).
5. Apply starting bonus (e.g., move markers).
6. First player receives the first player marker.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of three phases:

#### 1. Planning Phase (simultaneous)
- Each player selects cards from hand and places them face-down in available action slots beneath their player board.
- Start with 3 action slots; unlock 1 additional slot by reaching a special space on the diamond track and 1 on the bookkeeping track.
- Once all players place cards, turn all face-up.

#### 2. General Action Phase (turn order)
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, perform **one** of six actions:

**[1] Use 1 or More Goods Cards of One Type**
- Choose any number of face-up goods cards (coffee, bananas, cotton) of the same type.
- Total unit value = sum of card values.
- Use total to:
  - Buy **one** card from display: cost = card’s red crate value + board value.
    - If total ≥ cost, take card into hand. Use excess units to advance on company tracks.
  - Advance on one or more company tracks: 1 unit = 1 space forward. Split units freely.
- Flip all used goods cards face-down.

**[2] Use All Expansion Cards**
- Use **all** face-up expansion cards in your action area.
- Total expansion value = sum of helmet icons (1–3 each).
- Choose **one** company to expand.
- Enter regions adjacent to company base or company trading post.
- Cost to enter:
  - Single border: 1 point
  - Double border: 2 points
  - Occupied by another company: +1 point
- Take trading post from any column (must be foremost) of company base.
- Place post sideways in region (unclaimed reward).
- Repeat until expansion points exhausted.
- After expansion:
  1. Collect rewards (in any order): £, diamond track movement, company track movement, bookkeeping points.
  2. Remove other companies’ trading posts from entered regions. Return to rearmost empty space in any column. If 5th space is uncovered, do not cover it; use space in front.
  3. Tip your trading posts upright.
- Flip all expansion cards face-down.

**[3] Use 1 Diamond Merchant Card**
- Move diamond marker forward:
  - Basic card: 1 space, gain £2.
  - Company-specific card: 2 spaces, gain £1, then +1 space for every 2 mine icons controlled by that company.
- Flip card face-down.

**[4] Use 1 Bookkeeper Card**
- Optional: Pay £2 to flip one book on your bookkeeping track face-down.
- Move ink jar marker forward book-by-book:
  - Check requirements on each book (based on face-up cards in action area).
  - Requirements must be met to enter.
  - Flipped books have no requirements but give no reward.
  - Cannot enter empty spaces.
- Stop when you cannot or do not want to move further.
- Receive reward of the book you stopped on (if moved and book is not flipped).
- Spend bookkeeping points on card: buy A/B/C books or take £1 per point.
- Flip bookkeeper card face-down.

**[5] Place 1 Bonus Marker**
- Place one bonus marker on an empty bonus space.
- Pay any cost (e.g., £1, discard card).
- Receive immediate reward or reserve a bonus tile for next round.
- Marker blocks space for the round.

**[6] End Your Own Action Phase**
- Only if no other actions are possible or desired.
- Pick up **one** resting deck into your hand.
- Move all cards from action area to their linked resting decks above the board.
- Return bonus tiles to the board.
- You are now out for the round.

#### 3. Preparation Phase
1. **Move Coins**: Move coins from leftmost round track stack to the book display below. If 1 coin, place in top row; if 2, place one in each row.
2. **Fill Card Display**:
   - Discard all cards in the rightmost column.
   - Shift remaining cards right.
   - Refill empty spaces from top to bottom, right to left, from action card deck.
3. **Return Bonus Markers**:
   - Players take back their bonus markers.
   - If marker was on a bonus tile space, take that tile and place it in your action area (or next to board for "+1" goods tile).
- Begin next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Action Slots & Resting Decks**: Cards played in Planning Phase go to action area. After use, they go to linked resting deck. Each round, pick up one resting deck to recover cards.
- **Card Unlocking**: Reaching special spaces on diamond or bookkeeping track unlocks an additional action slot.
- **Bookkeeping Track**:
  - Requires book tiles to advance.
  - Acquire books using bookkeeping points (from expansion, bookkeeper cards, bonuses).
  - Costs: A = 1 point, B = 1 point, C = 2 points, £1 = 1 point.
  - Place books on track; cannot place A on crossed-out A spaces.
  - Flip book to skip requirement (costs £2).
- **Company Tracks**:
  - **Capital Calls**: Pay £ when passing; if cannot pay, stop before.
  - **Special Spaces**: Gain £ when reached/passed. All players who previously passed also gain again.
  - **Track Bonuses**: Unlock permanent bonuses (A/B tracks) or extra bonus spaces (C/D tracks). If both unlocked, choose one per round.
- **Bonus Tiles** (do not occupy action slots):
  - **"+1" Goods Tile**: Place on a face-up goods card to increase its value by 1. Flip both when used.
  - **Bookkeeper-Card Tile**: Use like bookkeeper (grants 1 point).
  - **Diamond Merchant-Card Tile**: Move 2 spaces, then +1 per other face-up diamond merchant.
  - **Expansion-Card Tile**: Use like expansion card (value = 2).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
After round 7:
1. **Cash**: Count £ in front of you.
2. **Company Shares**:
   - For each company: (uncovered coin icons in base) × (total shares owned).
   - Shares = from track (last share icon passed) + from cards.
3. **Diamond Track**: Last value passed (not current space).
4. **Bookkeeping Track**: Last value passed (not current space).
- **Total = Cash + Company Shares + Diamond Value + Bookkeeping Value**
- Highest total wins. Tie = shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use goods of different types to buy a card?** Only if you have the "use different goods types" bonus.
- **Can I use a bookkeeper if I don’t move?** Yes, but no reward. You still spend the bookkeeping points.
- **Can I use a bonus tile immediately?** No, you receive it in the Preparation Phase of the next round.
- **Can I pass without ending my phase?** No, "End Your Own Action Phase" is the only way to pass.
- **Can I use a card that gives a share of a company to expand that company?** No, expansion card share icons are only for scoring.
- **Can I use a bonus marker on a majority space if tied?** Yes, you may place if no one has more than you.
- **What if book supply runs out?** Leave empty spaces unfilled.
- **Can I use a permanent bonus without the required card?** No, e.g., expansion bonuses require at least one expansion card in action area.
- **Can I use both track bonuses?** No, if both unlocked, choose one per round.
