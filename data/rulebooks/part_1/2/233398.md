# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Endeavor: Age of Sail is a strategy game where players guide naval empires during the Age of Sail (1571–1862), connecting distant regions through trade, colonization, and influence. The objective is to amass the most Glory by the end of seven rounds through strategic development, control of cities and trade routes, and acquisition of buildings and asset cards.

In the solo Automa variant, the player competes against two automated opponents (bots). Victory is achieved by scoring more Glory than both bots.

## 2. Components
- Game board (7 regions: Africa, South America, Caribbean, North America, India, Far East, and Europe)
- 95 Trade tokens (brown attribute and blue action tokens)
- 42 Asset cards (8 decks: 6 regional, Europe, Slavery)
- 49 Building tiles (5 levels)
- 5 Start Building tiles
- 6 Governor cards (one per region)
- 5 Player mats
- 175 Population discs (35 per player in 5 colors)
- 20 Status track cubes (4 per player)
- 1 Score pad
- 1 Crown (start player marker)
- 4 Track extenders
- 14-card Automa deck (2 suits of 1–7 from standard playing cards)
- 2 Bots: each with discs, Shield, inventory area, and automa row space

## 3. Setup
1. Set up a standard 3-player game.
2. Assign a color to each bot; give each bot its discs and a Shield.
3. Create the automa deck: 14 cards (values 1–7 in two suits). Shuffle and place face-down.
4. Designate an inventory area and a 7-card-length automa row for each bot.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of five phases:
1. **Construction Phase**  
2. **Growth Phase**  
3. **Salary Phase**  
4. **Action Phase**  
5. **Discard Phase**

The player always goes first in turn order. After all players complete a phase, proceed to the next.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Bot Behavior (Automa)
- Bots do not use player mats or track attributes.
- Bots do not construct buildings except in Round 7.
- Bots do not discard asset or Governor cards.
- All bot discs are assumed active; no supply constraints.

### Construction, Growth, and Salary Phases
**Rounds 1–6**:  
- Reveal the top card of the automa deck and place it face-up at the right end of each bot’s automa row (one per bot per round).

**Round 7**:  
- Reveal a new automa card for each bot.
- Each bot constructs a level 5 building by taking the top available building from the tray. The building is placed in the bot’s inventory for end-game scoring. No Industry requirement.

### Action Phase
- Players and bots take turns in order; player starts.
- On a bot’s turn:
  - Move its Shield one card to the right on its automa row.
  - The value of the card where the Shield lands determines the targeted region (1–7).
  - Follow the bot’s action flowchart for that region.
  - After the action, the turn passes.
- If no card is available to the right, the bot passes and returns its Shield to inventory.
- Each bot performs a number of actions per round equal to the round number (e.g., 4 actions in Round 4).

### Bot Action Flowchart
1. **Ship**:  
   - On a closed region: Place disc on next available shipping track space. If this opens the region, bot wins the Governor card (placed in inventory).
   - On an open region: Place disc on unoccupied fleet space using priority: (1) Secure a link, (2) Token priority.
   - Collect any tokens; keep in inventory.

2. **Occupy**:  
   - Place disc on unoccupied city using priority:  
     (1) City with 2 Glory  
     (2) Secure a link between two cities  
     (3) City with 1 Glory  
   - Collect tokens; keep in inventory.

3. **Draw**:  
   - Draw top asset card from target region if bot’s presence ≥ draw value.
   - For Europe: choose between Europe or Slavery deck; prefer higher draw value. Tie → Europe deck.
   - Card kept in inventory.

4. **Attack**:  
   - Priority:  
     (1) City with 2 Glory  
     (2) Secure a link between two cities  
     (3) City with 1 Glory  
     (4) Fleet  
     (5) Open sea zone  
   - Always prioritize attacking the player over the other bot.
   - In case of tie, the player chooses the target.
   - Replace opponent’s disc with own.

### Token Priority
Used to break ties when multiple options exist. Priority order (left to right) is defined but not specified in text.

### Slavery Abolition
- Triggered when any player draws the Value 5 Europe card.
- Player discards slavery cards (with attribute adjustments).
- Bots are unaffected.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after Round 7.

### Final Scoring
- **Attributes**: Slide each attribute marker left to the nearest symbol. Sum values.
- **Cities & Links**: Count Glory from controlled cities (some worth 2) and links.
- **Buildings, Cards, Free Governor Slot**: Count visible Glory symbols on buildings, asset cards (including Governors), and Free Governor slot (if empty).
- **Extra Population**: +1 Glory per 3 discs in harbor (ignore remainder).
- **Slavery Subtraction**: −1 Glory per discarded or set-aside Slavery card.

### Bot Scoring
- Count all symbols from tokens, asset cards, and building tiles in inventory.
- Score according to game difficulty (not detailed in text).
- Bots score normally for cities, links, and Glory symbols.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Tie-breaking in bot actions**: When bots must choose between options, use token priority. For attacks, the player chooses.
- **Automa row overflow**: After 7 rounds, automa row has 7 cards. Bots perform up to 7 actions in Round 7.
- **Governor cards**: Bots keep Governor cards in inventory; no hand limit.
- **Building construction in Round 7**: Bots take topmost level 5 building regardless of supply or Industry.
- **No card to move to**: Bot passes and returns Shield to inventory.
