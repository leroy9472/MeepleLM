## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Decrypto*, two teams of 2–4 players compete to transmit secret codes to their teammates using clues based on their team’s private keywords, while simultaneously trying to intercept the opposing team’s codes. The goal is to communicate clearly with your team while obscuring meaning from opponents.  

**Primary Objective**:  
- A team **wins** immediately upon collecting **2 Interception tokens**.  
- A team **loses** immediately upon collecting **2 Miscommunication tokens**.  

The game ends as soon as one of these conditions is met.

### 2. Components  
- 2 Player Screens (1 black, 1 white)  
- 2 Code Decks (24 cards each: 1 black, 1 white)  
- 110 Keyword Cards (440 total words; double-sided with color-coded backs)  
- 4 White Interception Tokens  
- 4 Black Miscommunication Tokens  
- 50 Double-Sided Note Sheets  
- 1 Sand Timer (30 seconds)  
- Rulebook  

### 3. Setup  
1. Divide players into two teams of equal size.  
2. Teams sit on opposite sides of the table.  
3. Each team takes:  
   - 1 Screen matching their color (black or white)  
   - 4 Keyword Cards of the same color, placed face-up in the Screen slots (1 to 4) — **visible only to the team**  
   - Matching-color Code Deck (black or white)  
   - 1 Note Sheet  
4. Each team writes their team name on the colored side of the Note Sheet corresponding to their team.  
5. Place Interception tokens, Miscommunication tokens, and the Sand Timer in the center of the table.  

> **Note on Keyword Cards**: Use only one side (e.g., blue) per game. Flip cards only after all have been used to avoid repetition.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this strict order:

1. **Draw Code**:  
   - Each team selects an Encryptor (rotates each round).  
   - Each Encryptor draws one Code Card from their team’s deck and views it privately. The card shows a 3-digit code (e.g., 3.1.4), each digit referencing one of the team’s 4 keywords.

2. **Write Clues**:  
   - Each Encryptor writes one clue per line (top to bottom) corresponding to each digit in the code.  
   - Clues must be written on the team-colored side of the Note Sheet in the current round section.  
   - Once either Encryptor finishes writing, they flip the Sand Timer. The other must finish before time runs out.

3. **Read Clues (White First)**:  
   - The White Team’s Encryptor reads their three clues aloud, in order.  
   - All players (including opponents) write these clues on the **white side** of their Note Sheet (in the current round).  
   - The Black Team’s Encryptor then reads their clues aloud.  
   - All players write these on the **black side** of their Note Sheet.

4. **Team Discussion & Guessing**:  
   - Both teams discuss the clues just heard (but not their own code).  
   - Each team writes their guess for the 3-digit code at the end of each clue line (first column).  
   - The Encryptor who gave the clues does **not** participate in discussion or guessing.

5. **Intercept Attempt (Black Team First)**:  
   - Starting with the team that just heard the clues (e.g., Black Team after White’s clues), the team reads their guessed code aloud.  
   - **Exception**: No interception attempts in **Round 1**.

6. **Decrypt Attempt (Giving Team)**:  
   - The team that received the clues (e.g., White Team) reads their own guess aloud.

7. **Reveal & Token Distribution**:  
   - The Encryptor reveals the correct code.  
   - **Interception Token** awarded if the opposing team guessed correctly.  
   - **Miscommunication Token** awarded if the Encryptor’s team guessed incorrectly.  
   - It is possible for both to occur in the same round.

8. **Record Correct Code**:  
   - Both teams write the correct digits in the **second column** of the Note Sheet.  
   - At the bottom of the sheet, group all clues by keyword number (1–4) for future reference.

9. **End of Round**:  
   - Return Code Cards to their decks and shuffle.  
   - Check win/loss conditions.  
   - Proceed to next round with new Encryptors.

> **Repeat Steps 3–7**, alternating which team goes first each round (White in odd rounds, Black in even rounds).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Clue Rules  
- Clues may be words, phrases, sentences, sounds, gestures (e.g., mime, hum, dance).  
- Must refer to the **meaning** of the keyword — **never** to:  
  - Spelling (e.g., “C” for “Cat”)  
  - Number of letters (e.g., “8 letters” for “Scorpion”)  
  - Position (e.g., “third word” for keyword #3)  
  - Pronunciation (e.g., “sounds like ‘base’” for “place”)  
- Must be based on **publicly available knowledge** — no personal/private references (e.g., “our anniversary”).  
- **No repeated clues**: You cannot use the same clue (word or concept) more than once per game.  
- **Forbidden**:  
  - Reading the code aloud.  
  - Using any keyword (or its translation) as a clue, even for a different keyword.  

#### Note Sheet Usage  
- Double-sided: one side for your team (e.g., white), one for opponents (black).  
- Each round has space for:  
  - 3 clues (written by Encryptor)  
  - Two columns for code guesses:  
    - First column: team’s guess  
    - Second column: correct code (filled after reveal)  
- Bottom section: Clue Index — list all clues by keyword number (1–4) for tracking patterns.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition**: Collect **2 Interception tokens**.  
- **Loss Condition**: Collect **2 Miscommunication tokens**.  
- Game ends immediately when either condition is met.  

#### Tiebreakers (if no winner after 8 rounds or conflicting conditions):  
If at the end of a round:  
- A team has 2 Interception **and** 2 Miscommunication tokens  
- Both teams have 2 Interception tokens  
- Both teams have 2 Miscommunication tokens  
- No team has won/lost after 8 rounds  

Then resolve with:  
1. **Score Comparison**: +1 for each Interception, –1 for each Miscommunication. Highest score wins.  
2. If still tied: Each team takes turns guessing the other team’s 4 keywords. Team with more correct guesses wins.  
3. If still tied: Shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you use the same word in a different context?**  
  No. Even rephrased, if the clue conveys the same idea (e.g., “insect” and “dragonfly’s family”), it counts as repeated.  

- **What if the Sand Timer runs out?**  
  The Encryptor must submit whatever clues they have written. Fewer than 3 clues increases risk of miscommunication.

- **Can you improve a clue after reading it?**  
  No. Clues are final once read aloud. No clarifications or corrections allowed.

- **Do you get a reward for correctly decrypting your own code?**  
  No. There is **no reward** for correct self-decryption — only **no penalty**. Only interception earns tokens.

- **Can you use a keyword in a riddle or metaphor?**  
  No. Any direct or translated use of a keyword as a clue is forbidden, even indirectly.

- **Do teams keep the same keywords throughout the game?**  
  Yes. Keywords remain unchanged for the entire game.

- **What happens if both teams get 2 Miscommunication tokens?**  
  Apply tiebreaker rules.
