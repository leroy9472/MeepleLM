### 1. Lore & Objective
In this solitaire variant, you play against an artificial opponent (AO) using a domain deck. You and the AO each start with 20 life points. Your goal is to reduce the AO's life to zero as in a standard Magic: The Gathering game.

### 2. Components
- Your deck: A standard 60-card deck (minimum 50 cards).
- Domain deck: 40 spell cards and 20 basic land cards.
- Play zones: Battlefield, library, graveyard, exile pile, and "AO territory" (a zone for non-permanent AO cards).

### 3. Setup
1. Construct your deck (standard 60-card deck, minimum 50 cards).
2. Construct the domain deck: 40 spells + 20 basic lands.
3. Shuffle 18 lands with 40 spells to form the domain deck.
4. Shuffle the remaining 2 basic lands into the top 10 cards of the domain deck.
5. You go first. Play 3 turns before the AO takes its first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
AO Turn Sequence:
1. **Untap/Upkeep**: Untap permanents. Apply triggered abilities.
2. **Draw/Discard**: Draw the top card from the domain deck.
   - If it's a spell: place it in AO territory.
   - If it's a basic land: exile it.
3. **1st Main Phase**:
   - If a spell was drawn: resolve its ETB effects, instant/sorcery effects, or activated abilities (if newly drawn).
   - Ignore activated abilities on non-new cards.
   - If no spell drawn: apply static/triggered abilities from existing permanents.
4. **Combat Phase**:
   - AO attacks with all able creatures if advantageous.
   - New creatures do not attack (observe summoning sickness).
   - AO always blocks by matching highest toughness to your lowest power.
5. **2nd Main Phase**: Resolve lingering spell effects or phase triggers.
6. **End Phase**:
   - Apply end-step triggered abilities.
   - Remove unplayed instant/sorcery cards from AO territory to AO graveyard.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **AO Casting**: AO automatically plays spells when drawn. No mana cost required.
- **AO Territory**: Zone for non-permanent AO cards (instants, sorceries). Cards remain only if usable later in the turn.
- **Activated Abilities**: Only apply if on a newly drawn card. Mana cost is paid if non-basic land or artifact is in play.
- **Targeting Priority** (in order):
  1. Your creature with highest power (use toughness to break ties).
  2. Your land type with fewest in play.
  3. Your most recently cast spell.
  4. Option that causes most damage to you.
- **Decision Making**:
  - If multiple valid options, choose most damaging.
  - If still tied, randomly determine.
- **Card Removal**:
  - If AO must sacrifice/destroy/exile your card: you choose your most desired card as target.
  - If AO retrieves from graveyard: use the topmost applicable card.
- **No Hand**: AO has no hand. Domain deck substitutes for hand effects (e.g., discard from top of domain deck).
- **No Stacking on Your Turn**: AO cannot respond to your instants. All AO non-permanents must be played or discarded by end of AO turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: Reduce AO’s life to 0.
- **Lose Condition**: You reach 0 life, cannot draw a card, or hit poison limit.
- **Deck Exhaustion**: If domain deck is depleted, shuffle AO’s graveyard into a new domain deck.
- **No Alternate Wins**: Cards with alternate win conditions are not legal.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Unplayable Cards**: If a drawn AO card cannot be used (e.g., instant with no valid target), discard it to AO graveyard.
- **Summoning Sickness**: New AO creatures cannot attack, but can use activated abilities if newly drawn.
- **Non-Basic Lands**: Required to pay for activated abilities (since basic lands are exiled when drawn).
- **Domain Deck Size**: Always 60 cards (40 spells + 20 lands), even if lands are exiled during play.
- **Multiple Effects**: Prioritize most damaging outcome. Randomize only if equally damaging.
