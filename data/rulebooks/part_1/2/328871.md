# Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition – Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players take the role of corporations competing to make Mars habitable by increasing the planet’s temperature, oxygen level, and ocean coverage. The game ends when all three global parameters reach their maximum: temperature at +8°C, oxygen at 14%, and 9 ocean tiles placed. The player with the most Victory Points (VP) wins.

2. Components  
- Game board with temperature, oxygen, and terraforming rating (TR) tracks  
- 9 ocean tiles (blue side up when placed)  
- Project card deck (208 cards)  
- Corporation cards  
- Player boards with production tracks (MC, cards, heat, plants, steel, titanium)  
- Resource cubes (MC, heat, plants, steel, titanium)  
- Phase cards (I–V) for each player  
- Phase tracking tokens (I–V)  

3. Setup  
- Place game board in center; position temperature and oxygen markers at starting values (−30°C, 0%).  
- Each player:  
  - Chooses a color and receives matching cubes and player board.  
  - Places one cube on 0 of each production track.  
  - Places TR marker on 5.  
  - Receives 2 corporation cards, chooses one, discards the other.  
  - Receives starting resources and abilities per corporation.  
  - Is dealt 8 project cards (kept).  
  - Receives 5 colored phase cards (I–V).  
- Shuffle project cards to form draw deck; place discard pile nearby.  
- Shuffle and place 9 ocean tiles face-down on board or in stack.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has three steps:  
1. **Planning**: All players simultaneously choose a phase card (I–V) and place it face-down. Cannot choose same phase two rounds consecutively. Reveal all; only selected phases occur.  
2. **Resolve Phases**: Execute selected phases in fixed order (I → II → III → IV → V). Players act simultaneously.  
   - **I: Development**: Play one green card. *Bonus*: −3 MC if you chose this phase.  
   - **II: Construction**: Play one red or blue card. *Bonus*: Draw a card OR play a second red/blue card.  
   - **III: Action**: Use card actions once each; perform standard actions (spend heat/plants). *Bonus*: Use one card action a second time.  
   - **IV: Production**: Gain resources: MC = TR + MC production; heat/plants = production; draw cards = card production. *Bonus*: +4 MC.  
   - **V: Research**: Draw 2 cards, keep 1, discard 1. *Bonus*: Draw 5, keep 2.  
3. **End Step**: Discard down to 10 cards. Receive 3 MC per discarded card. Flip phase trackers closed.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Play**: Pay cost in MC. Discard cards for 3 MC each.  
- **Discounts**:  
  - Building tag (■): −2 MC per steel.  
  - Space tag (★): −3 MC per titanium.  
- **Requirements**: Must meet conditions (e.g., oxygen ≥ 6%) at start of phase.  
- **Global Parameters**:  
  - Raising temperature, oxygen, or placing ocean grants 1 TR each.  
  - During phase when parameter maxes out, players may still contribute and gain benefits.  
  - After max, no further TR or rewards for that parameter.  
- **Standard Actions**: Must spend 8 plants for forest (and +1 oxygen) or 8 heat for +1 temperature if able.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Trigger**: All three conditions met: 9 oceans, +8°C, 14% oxygen. Complete current phase, then score.  
- **Victory Points**:  
  - 1 VP per TR.  
  - 1 VP per forest VP token (1- and 5-point tiles).  
  - VP on project cards (including conditional).  
- **Tiebreaker**: Sum of MC, heat, and plant resources.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Same Phase Consecutively**: Not allowed. Must choose different phase.  
- **Bonus Eligibility**: Only players who selected the phase get the bonus.  
- **Discarding for MC**: Can be done at any time.  
- **Hand Limit**: Discard down to 10 only at end of round.  
- **Deck Exhaustion**: Reshuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
- **Parameter Maxing**: Players may act to raise a parameter in the phase it reaches maximum and gain TR/rewards. After that phase, no further gains.
