## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *The Search for Planet X*, players are astronomers competing to locate the hidden Planet X at the edge of the solar system. The objective is to earn the most points by correctly deducing the location of Planet X and submitting accurate theories about the placement of other celestial objects. The game ends when a player correctly identifies Planet X, triggering final scoring.

2. Components  
- 1 double-sided solar system board (12 sectors for Standard Mode, 18 for Expert Mode)  
- 1 Earth board  
- 1 wooden Sun disc  
- 48 theory tokens (12 per player, 4 colors)  
- 4 player screens  
- 8 target tokens (2 per player)  
- 1 pad of double-sided note sheets  
- 4 expert panels (for Expert Mode only)  
- Companion app (required; available at www.PlantXApp.com)

3. Setup  
1. Choose Game Mode: Standard (12 sectors) or Expert (18 sectors).  
2. Place the solar system board with the correct side up. Orient it so each player faces one of the four seasonal icons: Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice, Autumn Equinox, Winter Solstice.  
3. Insert the Sun disc into the center hole of the board.  
4. Place the Earth board on top, rotated so the arrow points to sector 1.  
5. Each player chooses a color and receives:  
   - Matching player screen and pawn  
   - 12 theory tokens (4 per object type: asteroid, comet, dwarf planet, gas cloud)  
   - 2 target tokens  
   - Note sheet matching their seasonal view and game mode  
6. In Expert Mode:  
   - Each player uses all 4 dwarf planet theory tokens  
   - Slide the expert panel into their player screen  
7. In Standard Mode:  
   - Return 3 dwarf planet tokens per player to the box (only 1 used)  
   - Do not use expert panels  
8. Install and launch the companion app on one or more devices.  
9. One device generates a game code; others join using the code.  
10. Each player selects experience level (Beginner, Experienced, Genius) and receives starting information via the app to record on their note sheet.  
11. Press "Start Game" on all devices.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- The player whose pawn is farthest back on the time track is the active player.  
- On their turn, the active player:  
  1. Takes one action (Survey, Target, Research, or Locate Planet X)  
  2. Advances their pawn clockwise on the time track by the action’s time cost  
  3. Rotates the Earth board clockwise until the arrow points to the sector with the farthest-back pawn  
- During rotation, if the arrow passes a Conference (X1/X2) or Theory (paper) icon, pause to conduct that phase.  
- Play continues until a player correctly locates Planet X.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Sectors**: The solar system is divided into 12 (Standard) or 18 (Expert) numbered sectors. Each contains one object or is truly empty.  
- **Visible Sky**: Exactly half the sectors are visible at any time, determined by the Earth board’s position.  
- **Actions**:  
  - **Survey for an Object**: Select an object type and a range of consecutive visible sectors. The app reveals how many of that object are in the range.  
    - Time cost: 4 for 1–3 sectors, 3 for 4–6 sectors, 2 for 7–9 sectors (Expert only)  
    - Comet surveys must start and end in comet-eligible sectors  
  - **Target a Sector**: Reveal the object in one visible sector. Costs 1 target token (2 per player). Time cost: 4.  
  - **Research a Topic**: Learn a logic rule about object relationships. Time cost: 1. Cannot be taken twice in a row.  
  - **Locate Planet X**: Guess the sector of Planet X and the objects in its two adjacent sectors. Time cost: 5.  
    - Success ends the game.  
- **Conference Phase** (X1/X2): When the Earth board reaches a conference icon, all players receive a shared logic rule about Planet X. Occurs only once per icon.  
- **Theory Phase** (paper icon):  
  - **Submission**: Players simultaneously choose up to 1 (Standard) or 2 (Expert) theories. Submitted face-down to peer review tracks.  
  - **Peer Review**: Theories in the innermost space are revealed and checked via app.  
    - Correct: Object confirmed; other theories in sector revealed. Incorrect theories removed; owners advance pawn 1.  
    - Incorrect: Object not confirmed; only the incorrect theory is removed; owner advances pawn 1.  
  - All theories move inward one space after submission.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Game Trigger**: A player correctly locates Planet X.  
- **Final Scoring Opportunities**: Players with pawns at least one sector behind may:  
  - Submit 1 theory (1–3 sectors back) or 2 theories (4–5 sectors back)  
  - Attempt to locate Planet X (normal rules apply)  
  - Actions taken in player order (back to front); no pawn advancement.  
- **Reveal Objects**: App reveals all sector contents. All face-down theories are flipped. Incorrect ones removed (no penalty).  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  1. **Leader Bonuses**: 1 point per sector where you were first (or tied) to submit a correct theory.  
  2. **Correct Theories**:  
     - Asteroid: 2 points  
     - Comet: 3 points  
     - Gas Cloud: 4 points  
     - Dwarf Planet: 4 points (Standard), 2 points each (Expert)  
  3. **Locating Planet X**:  
     - First to succeed: 10 points  
     - Others: 2 points per sector their pawn is behind the first player (2–10 points)  
- **Winning**: Highest total score wins. Tiebreakers:  
  1. Most points from locating Planet X  
  2. Most leader bonus points  
  3. Shared victory

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Planet X Appearance**: Always appears empty in surveys and targets.  
- **Truly Empty vs. Appears Empty**: Truly empty sectors have no object. Planet X’s sector appears empty but is not truly empty.  
- **Multiple Theories in Same Sector**: Allowed, even from same player (in different phases). Stacked theories submitted in same phase are considered simultaneous.  
- **Research Topics**: Each topic gives one rule; selecting it again yields no new info.  
- **Pawn Movement on Tie**: When multiple players receive a time penalty, advance pawns in player order (back to front) to preserve turn order.  
- **Bot Play (Solo)**: Bot actions managed via app. Bot only submits correct theories. Final scoring follows same rules.
