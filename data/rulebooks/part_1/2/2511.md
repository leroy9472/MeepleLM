## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
- Players assume the role of Baker Street Irregulars, amateur detectives working under Sherlock Holmes to solve complex mysteries in Victorian London.  
- The objective is to investigate crimes by gathering and interpreting clues from a variety of sources—newspapers, interviews, documents, and expert informants—and deduce the truth before Holmes does.  
- Cases typically involve murder, theft, or conspiracy, and require players to determine: who committed the crime, how it was carried out, and why.  
- The ultimate goal is not just to find the answer, but to arrive at it through logical deduction, debate, and synthesis of physical and psychological evidence.

2. Components  
- **Reference Map**: A detailed map of Victorian London divided into postal districts (NW, WC, EC, SE, SW), with ~500 numbered clue points representing specific or general locations.  
- **Case Book**: Contains case introductions and Holmes’s final solutions.  
- **Clue Book**: Lists all clue points and the information available at each for every case.  
- **Newspaper Archive**: A collection of in-game newspapers dated prior to or on the day of the case, providing background and potential leads.  
- **Directory**: Alphabetical listing of characters, places, and institutions, including many not directly mentioned in the case, to support investigative exploration.  
- **Quiz Book**: Contains case-specific quizzes to test players’ solutions; includes scoring and Holmes’s path of investigation.  
- **Time Rulers**: Optional tool for measuring travel time across the map (1 inch = 5 minutes).  
- **Case Notes Booklet**: For recording visited leads, questions, and scores.  
- **Informant Cards**: Reference cards summarizing key contacts and their areas of expertise.

3. Setup  
- Choose a case from the Case Book and read the introduction aloud.  
- Lay out the Reference Map where all players can see it.  
- Place the Clue Book, Directory, Newspaper Archive, and Quiz Book within reach.  
- Provide paper, pens, and the Case Notes Booklet for tracking leads and deductions.  
- Determine player roles: in group play, decide whether solving collectively or individually.  
- Begin with Game Turn 1.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Each game turn, one clue point is visited.  
- The active player selects a location (by number and district) and looks up the corresponding entry in the Clue Book for the current case.  
- The clue is read aloud (in group play) or silently (in solitaire).  
- Players may consult the Newspaper Archive and Directory at any time.  
- Clues may lead to new locations, suspects, or questions.  
- Players record visited leads and emerging theories.  
- The process repeats until players feel ready to submit a solution by completing the quiz.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Clue-Based Investigation**: Progress is driven by visiting clue points, each yielding a narrative snippet, testimony, or evidence.  
- **Deductive Reasoning**: Players must interpret clues, cross-reference information, and build logical chains of inference.  
- **Non-Linear Exploration**: Players choose their own path; there is no fixed order for clue discovery.  
- **Information Control**: Critical facts are “buried” under layers of indirect evidence, requiring inference rather than direct revelation.  
- **Multiple Evidence Types**:  
  - *Physical Evidence*: Weapons, footprints, documents, etc., often requiring interpretation (e.g., a knife with a reinforced tip implies stabbing through heavy clothing).  
  - *Psychological Evidence*: Motives, alibis, character traits, and relationships revealed through dialogue and background.  
- **Red Herrings & False Leads**: Some clues lead to dead ends or misleading conclusions, simulating real investigation.  
- **Deductive Chains**: Key facts are accessible only after solving a sequence of smaller puzzles or making intermediate deductions.  
- **Expert Informants**: Specific locations provide access to recurring characters with specialized knowledge (e.g., coroner, librarian, criminal informant).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when a player or group completes the quiz for the case.  
- Scoring is based on:  
  - **Leads Visited**: Each counting lead costs -5 points.  
  - **Questions Answered**: Points awarded for correct answers in the quiz.  
  - **Total Score**: Sum of leads and questions points.  
- Players compare their score to Holmes’s “par” score for the case.  
- Lower scores are better; the goal is to solve the case more efficiently than Holmes.  
- In competitive play, the player with the highest score wins (i.e., most correct answers with fewest unnecessary leads).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I revisit a clue point?** Yes, but each visit counts as a game turn and costs -5 points.  
- **Can I look at future newspapers?** No. Only newspapers dated the same as or earlier than the case date are accessible.  
- **What if I find a clue by accident?** The design aims to prevent accidental discovery of key facts through controlled deductive chains. However, players may encounter suggestive but ambiguous information early.  
- **How do I know which leads are “counting” vs. “free”?** The Quiz Book specifies which leads Holmes used; only those are counted in scoring.  
- **Can I ask questions not covered in the Clue Book?** No. All information must come from published clue points. Players cannot invent interviews or evidence.  
- **What if multiple solutions seem plausible?** The game encourages debate. The correct solution is the one best supported by all evidence, even if not 100% certain.  
- **How are themes used?** Some cases incorporate thematic elements (e.g., fashion, superstition) to unify the narrative and enrich character interactions, but these must tie into the core mystery to avoid feeling gratuitous.
