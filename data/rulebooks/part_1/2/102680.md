### 3. Setup
1. **Determine Start Player** randomly.
2. **Each Player Takes**:
   - 1 Player Mat
   - 1 Arch of Trajan → placed on "I" position
   - 12 Action Markers → place 2 in each tray
   - 1 Military Leader → placed in Military Camp
   - 15 Small Tokens → 1 in Military Camp, 1 in Worker Camp, rest in supply
   - 2 Discs → 1 on VP Track (0), 1 in Senate (in turn order, start player on bottom)
   - 1 Bonus Tile → drawn randomly, placed yellow side up
3. **Draw 2 Additional Bonus Tiles** → place yellow side up to the right of the Senate track.
4. **Shuffle Extra Action Tiles** face-down → place 3 face-up in left column of Forum.
5. **Shuffle Forum Tiles** face-down → place:
   - 1 in each of 10 Provinces
   - Forum spaces: 6 tiles (2P), 9 (3P), 12 (4P)
6. **Fill Construction District** → all 20 spaces with Construction Tiles, face-up.
7. **Sort Trajan Tiles by Category** → shuffle each stack, place face-up on game board.
8. **Place Ship Tiles** → on Seaport spaces, colored (blue) side up.
9. **Shuffle Commodity Cards** → face-down draw pile. Reveal top 2 cards → one on each side as discard piles.
   - Each player draws 3 cards (from draw or discard piles). Refill empty discard piles immediately.
10. **Each Player Draws 3 Trajan Tiles** (one from different categories) → places on "II", "IV", "VI" positions in any order.
11. **Shuffle Demand Tiles** → remove 3 randomly. Create 4 stacks of 3 → place each on a Quarter Year tile.
12. **Place Time Marker** → on start space of Time Track based on player count.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- The game lasts **4 quarters**, each consisting of **4 rounds** (1 cycle of Time Track per round).
- Players take turns clockwise.
- Each turn has 4 steps:
  1. **Take Action Markers** from one tray (must have ≥1), allocate them one by one clockwise to trays.
  2. **Move Time Marker** forward by number of markers moved.
     - If Time Marker lands on or passes start → place next Demand/Quarter Year tile on top.
  3. **Slide Markers Up** into trays.
     - If tray has markers matching a Trajan Tile above it → accomplish the tile (gain VP + perform action).
  4. **Perform Action** of the target tray (where last marker was placed).
- After a player’s turn, if Time Marker completed a cycle:
  - Reveal a Demand Tile (if <3 revealed).
  - If 3 Demand Tiles are revealed → trigger **End of Quarter**.
- After 4 cycles → remove Quarter Year tile, refill board, flip ships → next quarter.
- After 4th quarter → **Final Scoring**.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Actions
- **Seaport Action** (choose one):
  1. Draw 2 cards, discard 1.
  2. Take top card from either discard pile.
  3. Play 1–2 cards to Personal Display, draw replacements.
  4. Ship commodities using 1 ship → gain VP based on ship and card combo. Flip ship if colored side up.
- **Forum Action**:
  - Take any 1 tile from Forum → place on designated space on player mat.
- **Military Action** (choose one):
  1. Place 1 meeple from supply → Military Camp.
  2. Move Leader to adjacent province → take tile if present.
  3. Move 1 legionnaire from Military Camp to Leader’s province → gain VP shown, minus 3 per other player’s legionnaire there (min 0).
     - Max 1 legionnaire per player per province.
- **Trajan Action**:
  - Take top Trajan Tile from any stack → place under Arch.
  - Slide Arch to next empty slot clockwise.
  - If no empty slots → place Arch in center; move it to next freed slot when a Trajan tile is accomplished.
  - Cannot perform if no free slots.
- **Senate Action**:
  - Advance 1 space on Senate Track → gain VP shown.
  - Cannot perform if already on 8 VP space.
  - Place disc on top of any stack.
- **Construction Action** (choose one):
  1. Place 1 meeple from supply → Worker Camp.
  2. Move 1 worker from Worker Camp to Construction Site:
     - First worker → any site.
     - Subsequent workers → orthogonally adjacent to own workers.
     - If tile present → take it, gain VP.
     - If first tile of that type → perform bonus action (e.g., extra action).

#### Extra Actions
- After performing an action, if you have a matching **Extra Action Tile**:
  - Discard it → repeat the same action.
  - If you have a **+2 Marker** on that action → may repeat a second time (total 3 actions).
- Only **one** Extra Action may be used per turn.

  - Remove and resolve tile:
    - **Commodity Draw**: Gain 3 VP, draw 2 cards.

    - **Military**: Gain 2/5 VP, place 1/2 legionnaires in Military Camp.
    - **Worker**: Gain 2/5 VP, place 1/2 workers in Worker Camp.
    - **+2 Marker**: Gain 4 VP, assign +2 to any Extra Action space.
