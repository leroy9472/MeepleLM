## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *It's a Wonderful World*, you lead an expanding empire over four rounds, strategically drafting and constructing Development cards to build your civilization. The goal is to amass the most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the game through constructed cards, resource supremacy, character tokens (Generals and Financiers), and end-game scoring conditions.

You win by having the highest VP. In case of a tie, the player with the most constructed cards wins. If still tied, the player with the most character tokens wins. If the tie persists, players share the victory.

3. Place all Resource cubes and Character tokens (Generals, Financiers) on their designated supply spaces on the board.
4. Choose to play with either Side A or Side B of the Empire cards (recommended: Side A for first games). All players must use the same side.
5. Deal one Empire card to each player.
6. Organize your play area with:
   - Empire card
   - Draft area (for drafted cards)
   - Construction area (for cards under construction)
   - Space above Empire card for constructed Development cards (stacked with production visible)

**2-Player Mode Setup:**
- Deal 10 Development cards to each player instead of 7.
- After drafting 7, discard the remaining 3 (no Recycling Bonus).

**Solo Mode Setup:**
- Shuffle Development cards and create 8 face-down mini-decks of 5 cards each (Development Pools).
- Form a separate deck from the remaining cards.
- Use Empire card B-side.
- Skip Draft phase.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts **4 rounds**. Each round consists of **3 simultaneous phases**:

#### A. Draft Phase
- **3–5 players:** Deal 7 cards face down to each player.
- Players simultaneously:
  1. Choose 1 card and place it face-down in their Draft Area.
  2. Pass the remaining cards:
     - Rounds 1 and 3: Pass left
     - Rounds 2 and 4: Pass right
  3. Reveal the chosen card and repeat until each player has 7 cards in their Draft Area.
- **2-player variant:** Deal 10 cards, draft 7, discard remaining 3 (no bonus).
- **Solo mode:** Skip this phase.

#### B. Planning Phase
For each of the 7 drafted cards, choose one:
- **Slate for Construction:** Move card to Construction Area.
- **Recycle:** Discard the card and gain the **Recycling Bonus** (resource shown in bottom-right corner).
  - This resource may be placed:
    - On a card under construction (matching cost space), or
    - On your Empire card (if not used for construction).
  - If this placement completes a card’s construction, immediately:
    - Return all resources on it to supply.
    - Gain its **Construction Bonus** (center-bottom).
    - Add the card to your Empire (overlapping stack, production visible).
- Cards in Construction Area may be discarded at any time for their Recycling Bonus (resource goes **only to Empire card**; lose all placed resources).

**Solo Mode Planning:**
- You play **2 Sequences per Planning phase** (8 total over game).
- For each Sequence:
  1. Take a 5-card Development Pool into hand.
  2. You may:
     - Discard any 2 cards to draw 5 from the main deck, keep 1, discard 4 (repeatable).
     - Place any cards in Construction Area.
     - Recycle any cards for their bonus.
  3. Once Pool is resolved, take next Pool for second Sequence.
- Then proceed to Production.

#### C. Production Phase
Conducted in **5 sequential steps**, one per resource type (left to right on board):
1. Materials (tan)
2. Energy (black)
3. Science (green)
4. Gold (yellow)
5. Exploration (blue)

For each step:
1. **Production:**
   - Count matching icons in your **Empire** (Empire card + all constructed Development cards).
   - Cards with "combo" icons (e.g., 🅐 🅐) produce 1 per card of that type in your Empire.
   - Do **not** count cards under construction.
2. **Supremacy Bonus:**
   - Announce your total.
   - The player with the **highest unique total** gains the bonus token above that resource:
     - Materials → Financier
     - Energy → General
     - Science → Choose Financier **or** General
     - Gold → Financier
     - Exploration → General
   - **Tie:** No one gets the bonus.
   - **Solo mode:** You get the bonus **only if** you produce **at least 5** of that resource.
3. **Resource Placement:**
   - Take cubes equal to your production.
   - Place each cube:
     - On a card under construction (matching cost), or
     - On your Empire card.
   - **Cannot save or move cubes later.**
   - **Cannot place non-red cubes from Empire to construction.**
   - **Only red (Krystallium) cubes may be moved from Empire to construction.**

**Completing a Card During Production:**
- When final resource is placed:
  - Return all resources on the card to supply.
  - Gain Construction Bonus (place token or Krystallium on Empire card).
  - Add card to Empire stack (production visible).
- The newly constructed card **produces in the next resource step** of the same round.

**Krystallium Rule:**
- Whenever you have **5 non-red cubes** on your Empire card, immediately:
  - Return them to supply.
  - Gain **1 Krystallium (red) cube**.
- Krystallium:
  - Can be used as **wild resource** (except for Character tokens).
  - Can fulfill Krystallium-specific cost spaces.
  - Can be kept between rounds.
  - Only red cubes may be moved from Empire to construction.

**Discarding Under Construction Card:**
- At any time, discard a card from Construction Area.
- Gain Recycling Bonus.
- **Bonus must go to Empire card.**
- Lose all resources and tokens on the card.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Simultaneous Play:** No turns; all players act at the same time in each phase.
- **Drafting:** 7-card draft with directional passing (left in odd rounds, right in even).
- **Construction:** Cards are built by fulfilling cost (resources, Krystallium, or characters).
- **Krystallium:** Wild resource generated from 5:1 conversion on Empire card.
- **Supremacy:** One-time bonus per resource per round for highest production (no ties).
- **Card Chaining:** Newly built cards contribute to production from the **next** resource step onward.
- **Resource Placement:** Immediate and final; cannot be rearranged.
- **Card Reuse:** Unlimited copies of same Development card allowed.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
After Round 4:
1. **Gross Victory Points:** Direct VP on constructed cards.
2. **Combo Victory Points:** VP based on number of cards of a certain type (e.g., "2 VP per Project card").
3. **Generals:** Each General = 1 VP. Some cards grant bonus VP per General.
4. **Financiers:** Each Financier = 1 VP. Some cards grant bonus VP per Financier.
5. **Krystallium:** Worth **0 VP** at game end.
6. **Unconstructed Cards:** No value.

**Scoring Order:**
- Sum all above categories using score pad.

**Winning:**
- Highest total VP wins.
- Tiebreakers:
  1. Most constructed cards.
  2. Most character tokens.
  3. Shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I move non-red cubes from Empire card to construction?**  
  No. Only Krystallium (red) cubes can be moved.

- **Can I complete a card using a Recycling Bonus?**  
  Yes. If the Recycling Bonus completes a cost, immediately construct the card and gain its Construction Bonus.

- **Does a card built in Production phase produce that round?**  
  Yes, but only in **subsequent** resource steps.

- **Can I use Krystallium as a General or Financier?**  
  No. Krystallium replaces **resources only**, not character tokens.

- **What happens if I have more than 5 non-red cubes on Empire card?**  
  Convert in batches of 5. E.g., 12 cubes → 2 Krystallium, 2 cubes remaining.

- **Can I discard a card just placed in Construction Area?**  
  Yes, at any time, but Recycling Bonus goes **only to Empire card**.

- **Do combo icons count themselves?**  
  Yes. A card with 🅐 🅐 produces 1 per Project card, including itself.

- **Are resource cubes limited?**  
  No. If supply runs out, use substitutes or wait for returns.

- **Solo Scenarios:** Must build all required cards to win. Score determines medal (Bronze/Silver/Gold).
