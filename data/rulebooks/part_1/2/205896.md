## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Rising Sun*, players take on the roles of rival clans vying for dominance over ancient Japan. Through strategic positioning, political maneuvering, and warfare, players seek to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the Winter season. Diplomacy and negotiation are central—players may form alliances, make non-binding deals, or betray one another to gain advantage. The player with the highest VP total wins; ties are broken by Honor, and allied players who tie share victory.

### 2. Components  
- Game board depicting Japanese provinces  
- Clan screens and markers (for VP and Honor tracks)  
- Clan figures: Daimyo (1 force), Bushi (1 force), Shinto (1 force)  
- Stronghold tokens (up to 4 per player)  
- Political/War tiles (dual-sided)  
- Season cards (Core + optional expansion sets)  
- Shrine tiles (4 used per game)  
- War Province tokens (Spring I, Summer II, Autumn III)  
- War Number tokens (1–5)  
- Political Mandate tiles (7 total: Recruit, Marshal, Train, Harvest, Betray, plus 2 duplicates)  
- Coins and Ronin tokens (unlimited common supply)  
- Monster figures and counter bases (for monster season cards)  
- Alliance tokens  
- Score sheet (optional)

### 3. Setup  
1. **Choose Clans**: Each player selects a clan, places their screen, and positions their VP and Honor markers accordingly.  
2. **Honor Track**: Players are ordered by starting Honor Rank (lowest number = highest honor), seated clockwise.  
3. **Reserves**: Place Daimyo, 3 Shinto, and 6 Bushi next to screen.  
4. **Home Province**: Place 1 Daimyo, 1 Bushi, and 1 Stronghold in each player’s designated home province.  
5. **Shrines**: Shuffle 7 Shrine tiles, draw 4, place faceup left to right.  
6. **Season Decks**: Combine Core season cards with one expansion set (e.g., Archway, Teapot). Shuffle into three decks (Spring, Summer, Autumn) of 12 cards each.  
7. **War Tokens**: Separate War Province tokens by season (I, II, III), shuffle into three face-down piles.  
8. **Other**: Place mandate tiles, coins, Ronin, monsters, and war number tokens within reach.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each season follows this sequence:  
1. **Seasonal Setup**  
2. **Tea Ceremony**  
3. **Political Phase** (Mandate Turns → Kami Turns → Repeat)  
4. **War Phase**  
5. **Seasonal Cleanup**  

The game ends after Autumn; Winter is a scoring phase.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

  - Bribery (giving Coins/Ronin) allowed only during Tea Ceremony and Political Phase.

- **Summoning**: Multiple summons in one action count as single event for triggers.  
- **Daimyo Immunity**: Immune to targeted effects (e.g., Take Hostage, Fire Dragon), but not global effects (e.g., Oni of Plagues).  
- **Komainu**: Counts as both Monster and Shinto for Betray.

- **Ronin Usage**: Ronin tokens are not consumed when used in Hire Ronin.
