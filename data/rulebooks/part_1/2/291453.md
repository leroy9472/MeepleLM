## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are the leader of a circus, assembling a team of performers to put on a show stronger than your rivals’. The goal is to score the most points over a series of rounds by playing stronger card sets than the current “Active Set” on the table. You can strengthen your hand by scouting cards from existing sets. The player with the highest total score after all rounds wins.

  - 3 players: Remove all 9 cards containing "10"  
  - 2 or 4 players: Remove the single card with both "9" and "10"

- Deal all cards:  
  - 3 players: 12 cards each  
  - 4 players: 11 cards each  
  - 5 players: 9 cards each  
- **Do not look at or touch your hand until all cards are dealt**  
- After dealing:  
  - Each player takes 1 Scout & Show chip  
  - Place all Scout chips in the center of the table  
  - Starting Player Marker goes to the player holding the 1/2 card (or agreed upon by group)  

#### 2-Player Game Setup:

- Deal 11 cards to each player (22 cards remain)  
- Set aside the remaining 22 cards for Round 2  
- Each player receives **3 Scout chips** (Scout & Show chips are **not used**)  
- Starting Player must Show on their first turn

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise starting with the Starting Player. On your turn, choose **one** action:  

#### A. Show a Set  
- Play a valid set from your hand:  
  - **Single card:** Any card  
  - **Multiple cards:** Must be **consecutive in hand** and form either:  
    - A **run**: Consecutive numbers in ascending or descending order (e.g., 4-5-6 or 6-5-4)  
    - A **duplicate set**: All cards have the same number (e.g., 5-5-5)  
- To Show:  
  - If there is **no Active Set**, you may play any valid set  
  - If there **is an Active Set**, your set must be **stronger** (see Core Mechanics)  
- If successful:  
  - Flip over the previous Active Set and add it to your scoring pile  
  - Your set becomes the new Active Set  
  - You become the owner of the Active Set  

#### B. Scout  
- Take **one card** from either end of the Active Set  
- Add it to your hand in **any position and orientation**  
- The **owner of the Active Set** takes **1 Scout chip** from the center  
- The Active Set remains (unless now empty), and its ownership does not change  
- If the Active Set is reduced to 0 cards, next player may Show any set  

#### C. Scout & Show (Once per player per round)  
- Discard your Scout & Show chip  
- Immediately:  
  1. Scout one card from either end of the Active Set  
  2. Then Show a valid set from your hand (must beat the Active Set)  
- The old Active Set is added to your scoring pile  
- Your new set becomes the Active Set  

> **Note:** Scout & Show is **not available in 2-player game**

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Card Hierarchy (Determining a Stronger Set)  
When comparing sets, use these rules in order:  

1. **More cards beat fewer cards**  
   - 4-card set > 3-card set, regardless of type or value  

2. **Same number of cards: Duplicates beat Runs**  
   - 5-5-5 > 4-5-6  
   - 2-2 > 1-2  

3. **Same size and type: Higher value wins**  
   - Compare the **highest number** in the set:  
     - 6-6-6 > 4-4-4  
     - 7-8-9 > 4-5-6  
   - For runs: compare the highest card (7-8-9 beats 4-5-6)  
   - For duplicates: compare the duplicated number (5-5-5 beats 3-3-3)  

> You **cannot** Show a set equal in strength — it must be strictly stronger.

#### Hand Rules  
- You **cannot rearrange or rotate individual cards** during a round  
- **Only at the start of a round**, after viewing your hand, you may **rotate your entire hand** 180° (flipping all cards) once

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### End of Round — Triggered if any player:  
- **i.** Has no cards left after a Show  
- **ii.** All other players cannot or choose not to Show, and can only Scout (3–5 players)  
  - In 2-player: Round ends if a player cannot Show **and** cannot Scout (no Scout chips or no Active Set)  

#### Round Scoring:  
- **+1 point** per card in your scoring pile (collected Active Sets)  
- **+1 point** per Scout chip you own  
- **–1 point** per card remaining in hand  
  - **Exception:** The player who triggered the end of the round (via condition i or ii) **does not lose points** for leftover hand cards  

#### Post-Round:  
- Return all Scout chips to center  
- Return Scout & Show chips to players  
- Pass Starting Player Marker to the left  
- Deal new hands (using remaining deck or reset as needed)  

#### Game End:  
- Play **as many rounds as there are players**  
- Highest total score wins  
- Tie: Share victory  

#### 2-Player Specific Rules:  
- Game lasts **2 rounds**  
- After Round 1: Re-deal the 22 set-aside cards (each gets 11 again)  
- Each player starts Round 2 with **3 new Scout chips**  
- **Scout & Show not used**  
- When you Scout, **spend 1 of your 3 Scout chips** (place in center)  
- You **must continue taking turns** after Scouting, until:  
  - You Show, or  
  - You cannot Scout (no Scout chips left)  
- You **cannot refuse to Scout** to conserve chips — must continue if able  
- **Scoring bonus:** +1 VP per **remaining Scout chip** at end of each round (max +3)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I rotate individual cards during the game?**  
A: No. Only allowed to rotate the entire hand once at the start of the round.  

**Q: Can I Show a set that ties the Active Set?**  
A: No. Your set must be strictly stronger in size, type, or value.  

**Q: What happens if the Active Set is reduced to one card? Can I still Scout from it?**  
A: Yes. You may Scout the only remaining card. After that, the Active Set is gone — next player may Show any set.  

**Q: Can I Scout if I don’t want to?**  
A: In 3–5 player: Yes, you may choose to Scout even if you could Show.  
In 2-player: If you can Scout (have chips and Active Set exists), you **must** Scout if you don’t Show — you cannot pass.  

**Q: What if I use Scout & Show and the Active Set has only one card?**  
A: You may still do it. Scout that card, then Show a valid set.  

**Q: Does the Active Set count toward scoring?**  
A: No. Only **flipped-over** sets (your collected sets) count. The current Active Set is not scored yet.  

**Q: Can I Scout from my own Active Set?**  
A: No. You may not Scout from a set you own unless another player takes an action that allows it (e.g., via Scout & Show).
