## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Players represent noble families in 13th-century Troyes, competing to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) over a set number of rounds (4/5/6 rounds for 2/3/4 players). The game ends when the final Red Event Card is revealed. Players gain VPs through cathedral construction, event resolution, character card objectives, tradesmen placement, and other endgame conditions. The player with the most VPs wins.

2. **Components**  
- Game board with Cathedral, Activity Card spaces, Influence Track, Principal Buildings (Palace/Red, Bishopric/White, City Hall/Yellow), and Districts  
- Dice: Red (Military), White (Religious), Yellow (Civil), Black (Events), and Purple (Outdoor Activities, if used)  
- Meeples (Citizens): Player-colored and Neutral (Gray)  
- Cubes: Player-colored, used for cathedral and delayed-effect cards  
- Deniers (Coins): Currency  
- Victory Point (VP) tokens (hidden)  
- Influence markers  
- Character Cards (secret)  
- Event Cards: Red, White, Yellow  
- Activity Cards  
- Outdoor Activity Cards (optional expansion)

3. **Setup**  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - District marker (placed in one of the five central districts)  
  - 5 Deniers  
  - 1 secret Character Card (2 in 2-player game)  
  - 1 Influence marker (placed on 4 of the Influence Track)  
  - 20 Cubes  
  - 6/5/4 Citizens (for 2/3/4 players) into personal supply  
- Remaining pieces form General Supply.  
- Place one Activity Card (face down) of matching color and number on each Activity Card space.  
- Prepare decks:  
  - Red Event Deck: 4/5/6 cards (2/3/4 players)  
  - White and Yellow Event Decks: shuffled separately  
- Choose Start Player.  
- **Initial Placement**:  
  - Players place citizens one at a time in snake order (1st → last → last → 1st, etc.) on any space in Palace, Bishopric, or City Hall.  
  - After all players place their citizens, fill remaining spaces with Neutral (Gray) citizens.  
  - (2-player variant: 6 Gray citizens are placed before player placement.)

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Each round proceeds through the following phases:

**Phase 0: Reveal Activity Cards** (Rounds 1–3 only)  
Reveal one Activity Card of each color (I, II, III) and place them face up.

**Phase 1: Income and Salaries**  
- Each player receives 10 Deniers.  
- Pay salaries:  
  - 2 Deniers per citizen in Palace  
  - 1 Denier per citizen in Bishopric  
  - City Hall citizens cost nothing.  
- If unable to pay, pay what you can and lose 2 VPs.

**Phase 2: Assemble Workforce**  
- Each player rolls one die per citizen in each building:  
  - Palace → Red die  
  - Bishopric → White die  
  - City Hall → Yellow die  
- Place rolled dice in your District.  
- Start Player rolls and places dice for Neutral citizens in unclaimed districts.

**Phase 3: Events**  
i. **Reveal Events**:  
- Reveal top Red Event Card and place it on the leftmost Event space.  
- Reveal a White or Yellow Event Card as indicated on the Red card.  
ii. **Resolve Events (left to right)**:  
- Apply effects of each Event Card (e.g., Riots, Draft, Epidemic).  
- If a player cannot fully execute an effect, do as much as possible and lose 2 VPs.  
iii. **Combat Black Dice**:  
- Start Player takes number of Black Dice shown on all Event Cards and rolls them.  
- Starting with Start Player, each player in turn order must counter the highest remaining Black Die:  
  - Discard dice from your District totaling ≥ the Black Die’s value.  
  - Red dice count double.  
  - You may counter multiple dice if able.  
  - Gain 1 Influence Point per Black Die countered.  
  - If unable to counter the highest die, lose 2 VPs (die is discarded).  
- Continue until all Black Dice are countered or skipped.

**Phase 4: Actions**  
Starting with Start Player and proceeding clockwise, players take one action per turn until all pass or no dice remain. Actions:

1. **Activate an Activity Card**  
   - If no tradesman: Pay cost and place a citizen (from supply, board, or hire for 2 Influence) on a free VP space (or illustration).  
   - If tradesman present: Use 1–3 dice of matching color.  
     - Immediate Effect: Divide total by denominator, apply effect that many times.  
     - Delayed Effect: Divide total by denominator, place that many cubes on card. Cubes can later be spent to modify actions (1 per action).  
   - You must use the card’s effect if placing a new tradesman.

2. **Construct the Cathedral**  
   - Use 1–3 White dice.  
   - For each die, place one cube in the lowest empty space of the column matching the die’s value (1–6).  
   - Gain:  
     - 1 VP per cube  
     - 1 Influence for cubes in columns 1–3  
     - 2 Influence for cubes in columns 4–6  
   - Cannot place if no space in column.

3. **Combat Events**  
   - Use 1–3 dice of color matching the Event Card.  
   - Divide total by denominator, place that many cubes on flags (top-left to bottom-right).  
   - Gain 1 Influence per cube placed.  
   - When a card is full:  
     - Most cubes: gains top VP and takes card (or discards if neutral)  
     - Second most: gains lower VP  
     - Tie for first: split total VP (round down); first to place wins card  
     - Only one player has cubes: gains both VPs  
   - Return cubes to owners. Marauding card is cleared but not taken.

4. **Place a Citizen on a Building**  
   - Use exactly one die.  
   - Place a citizen (from supply, board, or hire for 2 Influence) on:  
     - Palace: space matching die value; existing citizen is expelled.  
     - Bishopric/City Hall: leftmost space of row matching die value; shift others right; rightmost is expelled.  
   - Expelled citizens lie flat on building until end of round.  
   - Only one citizen per player can be expelled per building per round.

5. **Use Agriculture**  
   - Use 1–3 Yellow dice.  
   - Gain Deniers = total ÷ 2 (rounded down).

6. **Pass**  
   - Place 2 Deniers in your District (if dice remain on board).  
   - Each subsequent time your turn comes, place 1 additional Denier.  
   - Once passed, you cannot take actions for the rest of the round.

**Phase 5: End of Round**  
- Retrieve expelled citizens to personal supply.  
- Collect Deniers from your District.  
- Return unused dice to General Supply.  
- Pass Start Player token to the left.  
- Begin next round.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Dice Groups**: 1–3 dice of same color used for actions.  
- **Buying Dice**: May take dice from other players or neutral. Cost depends on group size:  
  - 1 die total: 2 Deniers per die  
  - 2 dice total: 4 Deniers per purchased die  
  - 3 dice total: 6 Deniers per purchased die  
  - Neutral dice paid to Bank.  
- **Influence Points (max 20)**: Spend before actions or countering Black Dice:  
  - 1: Reroll one die in your District  
  - 2: Add one citizen from General Supply to personal supply  
  - 4: Flip 1–3 dice in your District to opposite side (sum = 7)  
- **Cubes on Delayed Cards**: Can be spent to modify one action (not during Black Dice combat). Only one cube per action.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
Game ends after the round in which the last Red Event Card is revealed.  
Each player scores:  
- VPs from VP tokens earned during game  
- +1 VP per uncountered Event Card with at least one of your cubes  
- + VPs from spaces occupied by your tradesmen on Activity Cards  
- –2 VPs for each Cathedral level (row) with no cubes of your color  
- + VPs from all Character Cards in play (each card scored by all players based on its criteria)  
- Reveal all Character Cards; all players score based on all cards.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Cannot perform full event effect?** Do as much as possible, then lose 2 VPs.  
- **Cannot counter Black Die?** Lose 2 VPs; die is discarded.  
- **More than 20 Influence?** Excess is lost.  
- **Ties in Event resolution?** Split VP total (round down); first to place wins card.  
- **Multiple cubes on same delayed card?** Only one can be used per action.  
- **Citizen placement on full row?** Rightmost is expelled.  
- **No dice left?** Round ends immediately.  
- **Hiring citizens:** Can hire for 2 Influence if none available.  
- **Using cubes to modify dice groups:** Cannot be used when countering Black Dice.
