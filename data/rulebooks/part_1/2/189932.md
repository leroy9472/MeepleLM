# Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The demon lord Juiblex has emerged from the Abyss to corrupt the Underdark with a spreading affliction of ooze and decay. Players control Drow houses vying for dominance in this destabilized realm. The core objective remains to earn the most Victory Points (VP) through controlling sites and building a powerful deck. However, the Scourge of Juiblex expansion introduces a new threat: an ever-spreading Affliction that removes troop spaces from play and penalizes players with troops caught within it. The game is won by achieving the highest VP total after accounting for both standard scoring and penalties from the Affliction.

2. Components  
- 24 green Affliction tokens (10mm discs, beads, or similar)  
- 1 Scourge token (green slime miniature or distinct pawn)  
- 1 Affliction board (printable component)  
- 40 cards: Scourge of Juiblex half-deck (includes 13x "The Affliction Spreads..." cards and 2x "Afflicted Guard" cards)  
- 1 twelve-sided die (1d12)  

3. Setup  
1. Place the Affliction board adjacent to the main game board.  
2. Place the supply of Affliction tokens next to the board:  
   - 2 players: 16 tokens  
   - 3 players: 21 tokens  
   - 4 players: 24 tokens  
3. The player with the last turn in the initial player order places the Scourge token on any white starting site (similar to placing a Spy).  
   - Place one Affliction token on that site.  
   - If the site has troops, remove one white troop and place it on the Affliction board. Place the Affliction token in the vacated space.  
4. Prepare the market deck normally. Shuffle the two half-decks together.  
5. Draw the initial six market cards. Remove any "The Affliction Spreads..." cards drawn and place them on the bottom of the market deck. Draw replacements so the market contains only purchasable cards at setup.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. On a player's turn, after purchasing cards, immediately replace any empty market slots.  
2. If the newly revealed card is "The Affliction Spreads...", discard it and trigger the Affliction spread.  
3. Resolve the spread by moving the Scourge token and placing an Affliction token.  
4. If the new replacement card also causes the Affliction to spread, repeat the process.  
5. Continue with the player's remaining actions.  
6. Proceed to the next player in turn order.  
7. The game ends immediately upon placing the last Affliction token from the supply.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **The Scourge Token**: Represents the leading edge of Juiblex's corruption. It moves when "The Affliction Spreads..." cards are drawn.  
- **Affliction Tokens**: Occupy troop spaces, rendering them non-existent for all game purposes. Sites with Affliction tokens are "Afflicted Sites."  
- **Afflicted Site**: A site containing one or more Affliction tokens. It remains a valid site for effects and spy placement, but troop presence cannot extend across it via tunnels.  
- **Moving the Scourge Token**:  
  - Move the Scourge token to a new site connected by a tunnel path from its current location.  
  - Choose the new site using this priority order:  
    1. Site with the fewest Affliction tokens.  
    2. Site with the most troops.  
    3. Major site over a minor site.  
    4. Site worth the most VP.  
    5. Roll a d12 to break ties, assigning equal number ranges to each tied site, rerolling any unused numbers.  
- **Placing an Affliction Token**:  
  - Place a token on an empty troop space at the Scourge token's new site.  
  - If no empty space exists:  
    - Remove a white troop to create a space.  
    - If no white troops, move a troop from the controlling player into the Affliction (tie-breaker: player order).  
  - **All other players** with a troop at the site must move one of their troops from an Afflicted site into the Affliction. If they have no troops on Afflicted sites, they are not affected.  
- **Moving Troops into the Affliction**:  
  - Card effects may allow moving a troop into the Affliction. The player chooses a troop (ideally an opponent's) where they have presence.  
  - White troops moved to the Affliction are instead removed from the game.  
- **Card Effects**:  
  - "The Affliction Spreads..." (Market Card): Triggers the spread sequence when revealed after a purchase.  
  - "Afflicted Guard" (Minion Card): Allows assassination of a troop at an Afflicted site if the player has a troop at an Afflicted site.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End Condition**: The game ends immediately when the last Affliction token is placed from the supply. Players finish the current round (until the last player's turn is complete). Any "The Affliction Spreads..." cards drawn after the last token is placed are discarded and have no effect.  
- **End Game Scoring**:  
  - Score all standard VP (site control, total control, trophy hall, deck/inner circle cards, VP tokens).  
  - For each of your troops on the Affliction board, lose VP equal to the total number of troops (from all players) on the Affliction board.  
  - Example: If there are 8 troops total on the Affliction board, and you have 3 there, you lose 8 VP for each of your 3 troops, for a total penalty of 24 VP.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: What happens if the Scourge token's new site has no empty troop spaces and no white troops?**  
  A: Move a troop belonging to the site's controlling player into the Affliction. If there are multiple players tied for control, the player whose turn comes first in clockwise order from the current player makes the choice.  
- **Q: Do I have to move a troop into the Affliction if I have one on an Afflicted site when the Scourge spreads?**  
  A: Yes. The rule states "All other players with a troop at the site must move a troop from a site with an Affliction token into the Affliction." This is mandatory.  
- **Q: Can the Scourge token move to a site it has been to before?**  
  A: Yes. The token can revisit sites.  
- **Q: Does an Afflicted Site count for presence?**  
  A: Yes, a site with an Affliction token is still a site. You have presence there if you have a troop, spy, or adjacent troop. However, presence cannot extend *through* the site via a tunnel if the tunnel doesn't connect directly to a troop space you control.  
- **Q: What happens to a site that has all troop spaces occupied by Affliction tokens?**  
  A: It is still a site. Spies can be placed there. Control is determined by any troops that might be present (though this is impossible if all spaces are occupied). Total Control is impossible because enemy spies (the Affliction) are present. The site control marker would be returned to the board.
