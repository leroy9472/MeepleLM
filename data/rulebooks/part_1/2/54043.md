## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   In Jaipur, players are rival traders competing to become the Maharaja’s personal merchant. To win favor, each player strives to be the richer trader at the end of each round by selling goods for rupees. The first player to win two rounds by earning two Seals of Excellence becomes the Maharaja’s chosen trader and wins the game.

3. **Setup**  
   - Place 3 camel cards face up in the center to form the initial market.  
   - Shuffle the remaining 52 cards. Deal 5 cards to each player.  
   - Place the remaining deck face down. Draw 2 cards from the deck and add them to the market so it contains 5 face-up cards.  
   - Players remove any camel cards from their hands and place them face up in a stack in front of them (their herd). Herd size remains hidden unless revealed.  
   - Sort goods tokens by type (diamonds, gold, silver, cloth, spice, leather). Arrange each pile in descending order of value, splayed so values are visible.  
   - Sort bonus tokens into three separate piles by sale size: 3-card, 4-card, and 5+ card bonuses. Shuffle each pile and place them face down (values hidden).  
   - Place the camel token next to the bonus tokens.  
   - Place the 3 Seals of Excellence within reach.  
   - Randomly choose a starting player.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   Players alternate turns. On each turn, a player must choose **one** of the following actions:  
   - **Take Cards**, or  
   - **Sell Cards**  
   A player cannot do both in a single turn. After the action, the turn ends and the opponent takes their turn.

   **Take Cards (choose one option):**  
   - **Take 1 Single Good:**  
     Take one non-camel goods card from the market into your hand. Replace it with the top card from the draw deck.  
   - **Exchange (Take Several Goods):**  
     Take 2 or more goods cards (not camels) from the market into your hand. Return an equal number of cards from your hand and/or camel herd to the market.  
     - You may return goods cards, camels, or a mix.  
     - You may not exchange just 1 card.  
     - You cannot both take and return the same goods type.  
   - **Take All Camels:**  
     Take all camel cards currently in the market and add them to your herd. Replace them with the same number of cards drawn from the deck.  
     - You must take all camels if you choose this option.  
     - You cannot take camels and goods in the same action.

   **Sell Cards:**  
   - Choose one type of goods from your hand.  
   - Discard any number of that type to the discard pile.  
   - Take one goods token per card sold, from the top (highest value) of the corresponding goods pile.  
   - If you sell 3 or more cards:  
     - Sell 3 → take one 3-card bonus token  
     - Sell 4 → take one 4-card bonus token  
     - Sell 5 or more → take one 5+ card bonus token  
   - **Restrictions:**  
     - When selling diamonds, gold, or silver, you must sell at least 2 cards.  
     - You can only sell one type of goods per turn.  
   - If there are fewer tokens than cards sold, you still receive the bonus token.

   **Hand Limit:**  
   - A player may never have more than 7 cards in hand at the end of their turn.  
   - Camels in a player’s herd do not count toward this limit.

   **Market Refill:**  
   - After any card is taken from the market (except during an exchange), refill the market to 5 cards using cards from the draw deck.  
   - If the deck runs out and the market cannot be fully refilled, the round ends.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Market Dynamics:** The market always holds 5 face-up cards. It is replenished after single-card draws or camel grabs, but not during exchanges.  
   - **Camel Herd:** Used as currency in exchanges. Camels do not count toward hand limit. Herd size is private.  
   - **Token Values:** Goods tokens are taken in descending order. Bonus tokens have hidden values revealed only when taken.  
   - **Strategic Timing:** Players must balance building sets for big sales, denying opponents valuable cards, and managing hand size.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   **Round End Conditions (immediate):**  
   - 3 types of goods tokens are completely depleted, OR  
   - The draw deck is empty and cannot refill the market to 5 cards.

   **Scoring Steps:**  
   1. **Camel Bonus:**  
      - The player with the most camels in their herd takes the camel token (5 rupees).  
      - If tied, no player receives the token.  
   2. **Total Rupees:**  
      - Players reveal and sum the rupee values of:  
        - All goods tokens  
        - All bonus tokens  
        - Camel token (if earned)  
   3. **Determine Round Winner:**  
      - The player with the most rupees receives a Seal of Excellence.  
      - **Tiebreakers (in order):**  
        1. Most bonus tokens  
        2. Most goods tokens  
      - If still tied, no seal is awarded (unlikely due to token values).

   **New Round Setup:**  
   - If no player has 2 Seals of Excellence:  
     - Reset the game using the same setup.  
     - The player who lost the previous round becomes the starting player.  
   - Seals of Excellence are retained between rounds.

   **End of Game:**  
   - The game ends immediately when any player earns their second Seal of Excellence.  
   - That player wins and becomes the Maharaja’s personal trader.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Can I sell only one diamond/gold/silver card?**  
     No. Minimum 2 cards required when selling diamonds, gold, or silver.  
   - **What if I have 7 cards and want to take one card?**  
     You cannot take a card if it would exceed 7 cards in hand.  
   - **Can I exchange 2 cards for 2 camels?**  
     Yes, as long as you are taking goods and returning camels (or goods).  
   - **Do bonus tokens get reshuffled if not all are taken?**  
     No. Bonus tokens are drawn from their respective piles and not returned during the round.  
   - **Can I take camels and goods in the same action?**  
     No. You must choose either goods or camels, never both.  
   - **Is the herd visible?**  
     The herd is face up but may be stacked to hide the number of camels. Players are not required to disclose herd size.  
   - **What happens if I sell 6 cards?**  
     You take one 5+ bonus token (same as for 5 cards). Only one bonus is awarded per sale.
