## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

### 2. Components  
- A deck of cards featuring trees, animals, plants, and mushrooms  
- Three Winter cards  
- One Clearing (game board)  
- One Cave card per player  
- Score sheets or scorepad  
- Optional: Automa cards for solo play, expansion cards (e.g., Alpine)

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the **Clearing** in the center of the table.  
2. Give each player a **Cave card**.  
3. Remove the three **Winter cards** from the deck.  
4. Return a number of additional cards to the box based on player count:
   - 2 players: 30 cards removed  
   - 3 players: 20 cards removed  
   - 4 players: 10 cards removed  
   - 5 players: none removed  
5. Shuffle the remaining cards and divide them into three roughly equal piles.  
6. Shuffle **two Winter cards** into the first pile and place the **third Winter card on top** of that pile.  
7. Stack the other two piles on top to form the full deck. Place the deck on the left side of the Clearing.  
8. Deal **six cards** to each player.  
9. If a player has **no tree card**, they may return their hand and draw six new cards **once only**.  
10. Randomly determine the **first player**.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

#### Action 1: Draw Two Cards  
- Draw **two cards**, one at a time, from either:
  - The top of the deck, or  
  - The Clearing (face-up cards)  
- You may mix sources (e.g., one from deck, one from Clearing).

#### Action 2: Play a Card and Check the Clearing  
1. **Pay the cost** of the card (number in brown symbol, upper-left corner) by placing that many cards from your hand **face up into the Clearing**.  
2. **Place the played card** face up in your **Forest** area.

##### Card Types & Placement Rules:
- **Tree Cards**:
  - Placed individually.
  - Each side of a tree card provides a **slot** for other cards.
  - A tree is **fully occupied** when all its slots are filled.
  - **Common Toad** and **European Hare** may share a slot with one other of the same type.
- **Sapling**:
  - Play any card **face down** as a universal tree sapling.
  - Functions like a tree (provides slots) but is not a species.
- **Animals, Plants, Mushrooms**:
  - Tucked under a tree card in an **empty slot**.
  - Only half the card shows (species side or symbol side).

##### Placement Effect & Bonus:
- **Placement Effect** (gray box): Optional, resolved immediately unless permanent.
- **Placement Bonus** (gray box with binoculars icon and colored arrow): Optional. Triggered only if **all cost cards** match the **tree symbol** (upper-right) of the played card.
  - Split cards count if **either half** matches the required tree.
- Resolve **effect first**, then bonus.
- Any card draws from effects/bonuses come from the **top of the deck**.

##### End of Turn – Check the Clearing:
- If the **Clearing has 10 or more cards**, discard **all** to the game box.
- If an effect or bonus grants an **extra turn**, take it immediately.

#### Winter Cards:
- When drawn (from deck), place **face up next to the Clearing** and **draw a replacement**.
- Game ends **immediately** when the **third Winter card** is revealed.

---

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Costs**: Paid by discarding cards to the Clearing.  
- **Tree Slots**: Trees have four sides; each side accepts one card unless shared (Toad, Hare).  
- **Hand Limit**: 10 cards. Excess draws ignored.  
- **Card Interactions**:
  - Scoring often depends on counts, combinations, or presence of specific symbols (e.g., Tree, Insect, Bird, etc.).
  - Some cards grant ongoing abilities (e.g., Charterelle allows extra draws when playing trees).
- **Saplings**: Count as trees for all purposes (scoring, slots, species count) but not as a species.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End**: Triggered when the **third Winter card** is revealed. Players **do not finish their turn**.
