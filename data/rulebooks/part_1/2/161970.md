- Initialize card reader app with new game code, ensuring correct variant selection

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 6 rounds. Each round follows this sequence:

**A. Choose Play Order**
- Starting with current starting player, players choose unoccupied order spaces clockwise
- Order spaces provide ingredients, favor cards, or advantages (going first)
- Paralyzed players (from drinking poison) use special bottom space
- Play order for the round is determined by chosen spaces (lowest acts first)

**B. Declare Actions**
- Players declare all actions simultaneously in reverse play order (lowest player first)
- Place action cubes on chosen action spaces in corresponding player rows
- First round limited to 3 action cubes per player

**C. Resolve Actions**
- Resolve action spaces clockwise around the board
- Within each space, players act in order from highest to lowest row
- Actions available:

1. **Forage for Ingredient**: Take 1 face-up ingredient or draw randomly
2. **Transmute Ingredient**: Discard 1 ingredient for 1 gold
3. **Buy Artifact**: Purchase available artifact, paying cost
4. **Test on Student**: Mix 2 ingredients, reveal potion result to all
5. **Drink Potion**: Mix 2 ingredients, reveal result, suffer negative effects if applicable
6. **Sell Potion** (rounds 2-6): Sell to adventurer, offering quality guarantee
7. **Publish Theory** (rounds 2-6): Publish new theory or endorse existing one
8. **Debunk Theory** (rounds 2-6): Prove a published theory incorrect
9. **Exhibit Potion** (final round only): Demonstrate potion mastery

**D. End of Round**
1. Top Alchemist Award: +1 reputation to player with most seals (excludes conflicted theories in master variant)
2. Unused Cubes: Draw 1 favor card per pair of unused cubes
3. Hospital: Move cubes from hospital to unused cubes space
4. New Adventurer: Reveal next adventurer tile
5. Conference (rounds 3 and 5): Resolve conference tile effects based on number of seals
6. New Artifact Cards: Replace artifacts with next level (II after round 3, III after round 5)
7. Setup for Next Round: Refresh ingredient row, reset order markers, pass starting player token

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Alchemy System**
- 8 ingredients each correspond to unique alchemical (3 aspects: red, green, blue, each + or -)
- Alchemicals have one "big" aspect (large circle) and two "small" aspects (small circles)
- When mixing two ingredients:
  - Match between big aspect of one and small aspect of other (same color, same sign) creates potion of that color/sign
  - No matching signs across all colors creates neutral potion
  - Two matching aspects (including size) follows R→G→B→R sequence for potion color

**Information Gathering**
- **Experiments**: Mix 2 ingredients via Test on Student or Drink Potion to learn result
- **Selling Potions**: Gain information even with ambiguous results
- **Debunking**: Publicly prove theories incorrect, revealing information
- **App Requirements**: Use card reader app to determine potion results (scan cards or select manually)

**Player Interaction**
- **Publishing Theories**: Place alchemical token on ingredient book, pay 1 gold, gain 1 reputation
- **Endorsing Theories**: Pay 1 gold to bank and 1 gold per existing seal, place own seal
- **Seals**: Use to bet on theory accuracy (starred = confident, unstarred = hedged on specific aspect)
- **Grants**: Earn by having seals on required number of ingredients shown on grant tile (2 for first, 3 for subsequent)

**Action System**
- Worker placement with variable player order
- Action cubes placed in rows corresponding to play order
- Limited actions per space based on cube requirements
- Declining actions returns cubes to unused pool (1 favor card per pair)

**Negative Effects**
- **Test on Student**: After first negative potion, subsequent tests cost 1 gold
- **Drink Potion**: Negative potions cause:
  - Blue: -1 reputation (insanity)
  - Green: Paralysis (use bottom order space next round)
  - Red: Hospital (lose 1 action cube next round)
- **Selling**: Neutral or wrong-sign potions lose 1 reputation

**Reputation Zones**
- Red Zone (≤6): -1 gold when selling, -1 less reputation loss
- Green Zone (14-17): +1 smiley face when selling, -1 more reputation loss
- Blue Zone (≥18): +1 gold when selling, +1 smiley face, -2 more reputation loss
- Reputation minimum: 1

### 6. Scoring & End Game

     - Silver-starred seal: +3 VP
     - Unstarred seal: 0 VP
   - Incorrect theories:
     - Starred seal: -4 VP

     - Proper hedging: Only if exactly one aspect is wrong and hedge matches that color

**Winner**: Player with most victory points. Ties broken by leftover gold, then shared.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Paralyzed Players**: Use bottom order space, starting player passes to left if recipient is paralyzed
- **Multiple Negative Effects**: Cannot suffer same penalty twice in one round
- **Debunking Own Theory**: Gain 2 reputation if successful, but lose 5 if starred seal not hedged (net -3)
- **Immediate Publication**: After successful debunk, may immediately publish related theory if have cube on Publish space
- **Conflicts (Master Variant)**: Mark conflicting theories with tokens; seals don't count for grants/conferences/top alchemist but do count for final scoring
- **App Failure**: Use gamemaster triangle with ingredient tiles for non-digital play
- **Ties**: In Top Alchemist Award, all tied players gain reputation
