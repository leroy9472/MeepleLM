## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Inis is a strategic area-control game set in ancient Ireland. Players lead clans across a mythical landscape, vying to become High King by fulfilling victory conditions through control, presence, and influence. The game emphasizes tactical card play, territorial dominance, and timing.

Objective: Be the first player to meet the most victory conditions during the Assembly phase while holding a Pretender token.

2. Components  
- Clan figures (12 per player)  
- Territory tiles  
- Advantage cards (matching territory tiles)  
- Action cards  
- Epic Tale cards  
- Pretender tokens  
- Deed tokens  
- Festival marker  
- Flock of Crows token (two-sided: green/red)  
- Capital marker  
- Sanctuary and Citadel buildings  
- Season board and marker (expansion)  
- Harbor tiles (expansion)  

3. Setup  
- For 2–4 players: Use appropriate number of territory tiles (2 for 2 players, 3 for 3, 4 for 4). Tiles must be adjacent to at least two others.  
- Place matching Advantage cards faceup near the board.  
- Shuffle Action and Epic Tale decks separately.  
- Random player receives Brenn marker. Brenn chooses the Capital territory and places Capital marker and one Sanctuary there.  
- Brenn tosses Flock of Crows to set initial turn order.  
- Each player places 2 clans on the board, starting with Brenn and proceeding in turn order.  
- Each player receives starting Action cards:  
  - 2 players: 6 cards after two drafts of 3 cards each  
  - 3–4 players: 4 cards after one draft  
  - 5 players: 4 cards (with expanded deck)  
- Return unused 4-player Action cards if playing with fewer players.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of two phases:

Phase 1: The Assembly  
1. Assign Brenn: Chieftain of the Capital becomes Brenn. If no chieftain, Brenn remains unchanged.  
2. Check for Victory: Only players with a Pretender token are checked. Count how many of the three victory conditions each meets. If no player has a Pretender, no winner is declared.  
3. Take Advantage Cards: Chieftains take their territory’s Advantage card.  
4. Flip Flock of Crows: Toss like a coin to determine turn order.  
5. Deal and Draft Action Cards:  
   - Brenn shuffles Action deck and sets aside one card face down.  
   - Players draft cards:  
     - 3–4 players: Pass-and-hold draft over three rounds (1→2→3 held).  
     - 2 players: Two separate drafts of 3 cards, resulting in 6 cards.  
6. (Expansion) Sacred Festivals: Resolve season effects if Seasons of Inis is used.

Phase 2: The Season  
- Starting with Brenn, players take turns in order. On a turn, a player may:  
  a) Play a Season card (Action, Advantage, or Epic Tale)  
  b) Pass  
  c) Take a Pretender token (if eligible)  
- Play continues until all players pass consecutively.  
- End of Season:  
  - Discard all Action cards.  
  - Keep Epic Tale cards in hand.  
  - Return Advantage cards if no longer chieftain of matching territory.  
  - Remove Festival marker if present.  
- New round begins with Assembly.

5. Core Mechanics  
Clashes:  
- Triggered when clans move into a territory with opposing clans.  
- “Placing” clans (e.g., via New Clans) does not trigger a clash.  
- Instigator is the player who moved clans or played the initiating card.  

Clash Resolution:  
1. Citadel Phase: Starting with player after instigator, each non-instigator may place one clan in an unoccupied Citadel.  
2. Resolution Phase: Starting with instigator, each player with exposed clans performs a maneuver:  
   - Attack: Choose opponent; they discard Action card or remove exposed clan.  
   - Withdraw: Move exposed clans to adjacent territory where player is chieftain.  
   - Epic Tale Maneuver: Play eligible Triskel card (e.g., Tale of Cúchulain).  
- Clash ends when all exposed clans are removed or players agree to end.

Triskel Cards:  
- Played in response to specific triggers (e.g., after playing a card, during a clash).  
- Active player resolves first if multiple Triskel cards are played simultaneously.  
- Examples: Geis (nullify Action card), Stone Circle (retrieve Epic Tale), Dagda (nullify card effect).

Deed Tokens:  
- Acquired via cards like Bard or Master Craftsman.  
- Act as “wilds”: each adds +1 toward any one victory condition.  
- Each Deed used only once per victory condition.  
- Retained between rounds unless player has zero clans.

Pretender Token:  
- Can be taken only if:  
  - Player meets at least one victory condition  
  - Player does not already hold a Pretender token  
- Only players with Pretender tokens can win.  
- Returned after each Assembly phase if no winner.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Victory Conditions (any player can meet multiple):  
1. Chieftain over 6+ opposing clans: Sum opposing clans in territories where player is chieftain.  
2. Present in territories with 6+ total Sanctuaries: Sum Sanctuaries in territories where player has at least one clan.  
3. Present in 6+ territories: Count territories with at least one of player’s clans.  

Modified by Deeds: Each Deed reduces required threshold by 1 (e.g., 5 required with 1 Deed).  

End Game Check (Assembly Phase, Step 2):  
- If no player has a Pretender token → no winner, continue.  
- Otherwise, check all players with Pretender tokens:  
  - Player with most met victory conditions wins.  
  - Tie: Brenn wins if among tied players.  
  - No Brenn in tie → no winner; return Pretender tokens and continue.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can you play a card you can’t fully execute? Yes. Partial or no effect still counts as played.  
- Can a single Deed fulfill multiple conditions? No. Each Deed used once per condition.  
- What if a player has no clans? Must discard a Deed if possible, then place 2 clans.  
- Can you initiate a clash with no opposing clans? Yes (e.g., Warlord), but no clash occurs unless opponents are present.  
- Festival effect: Instigator loses a clan immediately if Festival token is in territory, even if clash ends peacefully.  
- Iron Mine: Attacked player must discard Action card and remove clan. If no Action cards, still must remove clan.  
- Hills vs. Iron Mine: Hills cancels Iron Mine; both cards discarded.  
- Morrigan: Can initiate clash in territory without your clans.  
- Master Craftsman: Can be played with no cards in hand; still draw Epic Tale card.  
- Stone Circle: Clan discarded must be your own.  
- Deirdre’s Beauty: Can play received Epic Tale card before removing clan.  
- Salt Mine + Cove: You may return the same card taken.
