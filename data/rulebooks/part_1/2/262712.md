# Res Arcana: Archmagus Solo Variant

## 1. Lore & Objective
As one of nine Mages, your objective is to win three successive games of Res Arcana in as few rounds as possible. By achieving this feat, you prove yourself worthy of becoming an Arch-Mage — one of the most famed mages of all time.

Victory is measured by efficiency: your total score is based on how quickly you win each of the three games. The fewer rounds used across all games, the higher your standing.

## 2. Components
This variant uses standard Res Arcana components with minor exclusions:
- **Mages**: 9 available; choose one per game.
- **Magic Items**: 8 total; Healer is removed.
- **Monuments**: 10 total; Golden Statue is removed.
- **Places of Power (PoPs)**: 5 double-sided tiles.
- **Artifacts**: 40-card deck.
- **Essences**: 150 tokens (Elan, Life, Calm, Death, Gold), including 12 "5x" essence chips.
- **First Player Token**: Removed from play.
- **6 "5x" Essence Chips**: Used to track rounds played.

Note: All components are from the base Res Arcana game unless otherwise specified.

## 3. Setup
### General Setup (All Games)
1. Remove these components: Healer (Mage), Golden Statue (Monument), and First Player Token.
2. Place 6 "5x" essence chips in a row — these track rounds across each game.
3. Randomly set out 3 Places of Power face-up.
4. Shuffle Monuments; reveal 2, rest form draw pile.
5. Shuffle 40 Artifacts; deal 8 to each player (in solo, to yourself).
6. Each player draws 2 Mages; choose one, return other.
7. Each player chooses a Magic Item in reverse player order.

### Game 1 Setup
- Proceed with general setup.
- After drawing 2 Mages and 8 Artifacts:
  - Deal yourself 11 Artifacts (shuffle unused back in if needed).
  - Examine all 11; discard 3 (return to box).
  - Shuffle remaining 8 into a deck.
  - Draw initial hand of 3 cards.
  - Choose your Mage and Magic Item normally.

### Games 2 & 3 Setup
- Retain your chosen Mage from previous game.
- Keep all unplayed Artifacts (in hand, deck, or discard pile).
- Deal additional Artifacts so you have 11 total cards to evaluate.
- Examine all 11; discard 3 (return to box).
- Shuffle remaining 8 into new Artifacts deck.
- Draw initial hand of 3.
- Choose new Magic Item.
- **Additional Step (Post-Hand Draw)**: 
  - Gain 1 Essence (any type except Gold) for every point by which you exceeded 10 VP in the prior game (ΔVP = Final VP – 10).
  - These are added to your starting 5 essences.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
You play exactly **3 games**. Each game follows standard Res Arcana rules with specific modifications.

### Per-Round Sequence
1. **Start of Round**:  
   - Place 1 "5x" essence chip in a row to track round count (max 6 per game).
2. **Collect Essences Phase**:  
   - Perform Collect abilities and/or take essences from components as normal.
3. **Action Phase (Clockwise)**:  
   - Take turns doing one action until you pass.
   - Actions: Place Artifact, Claim Monument/PoP, Discard for Essences, Use Power, or Pass.
   - **Power Use Rule**: Each time you use a power on any component, flip the Magic Item in the leftmost slot of the Magic Items row to its Passed side. Continue flipping Magic Items with each power use until you pass.
4. **Passing**:
   - Skip claiming First Player Token.
   - Swap your Magic Item:
     - Take a face-up Magic Item from supply (only untapped/face-up ones available).
     - If none available, randomly select a face-down tile instead.
   - Shuffle remaining Magic Items and prepare new row for next round.
   - Draw 1 card (reshuffle discard if needed).

### Victory Check
- After all players have passed (in solo, after you pass), check if you have **10 or more VP**.
- If you do **not** have 10+ VP by the end of **Round 6**, you lose the game.
- If you reach 10+ VP earlier, the game ends immediately upon meeting the condition.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Win Condition per Game**: Gain **10+ VP** within **6 rounds or fewer**.
- **Tracking Rounds**: Use "5x" chips to count rounds played (up to 6 per game).
- **Magic Item Passing Mechanic**: 
  - Unlike standard rules where passing once swaps your item, here each **power use** flips a Magic Item in the row.
  - You continue flipping items with each power used until you pass.
- **Artifact Deck Management**:
  - At start of each game, reconstitute deck from retained + newly dealt cards (11 total, discard 3, keep 8).
  - "Gain ? equal to ? of one rival" powers are invalid — discard and replace such Artifacts during setup.
- **Ignored Powers**:
  - Ignore: "Check Victory Now", "Life Loss", and "React to" powers on all components.
- **Special Component Rules**:
  - **Coral Castle**: Costs 1 less of Elan, Life, and Calm.
  - **Sorcerer's Bestiary**:
    - Can place Dragons from discard.
    - Second power allows placing Creatures (in addition to Dragons).

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- After each game, calculate **Delta (Δ)**:
  - Δ = 6 – (number of rounds played to reach 10+ VP)
  - Example: Win in Round 4 → Δ = 2
- After Game 3, sum deltas: **Total Score = ΣΔ = Δ₁ + Δ₂ + Δ₃**
- Your **Victory Standing** is determined by total score:
  - Higher ΣΔ = better efficiency = higher rank as Arch-Mage

> Note: If you fail to reach 10 VP by Round 6 in any game, you lose the campaign.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Q: What happens if I exceed 10 VP mid-round?**  
  A: You may use Coral Castle or Sorcerer’s Bestiary to check victory early and win immediately.

- **Q: Can I use React powers even though they’re ignored?**  
  A: No — all "React to" powers are ignored, including React to Life Loss or Victory Check.

- **Q: Do Life Loss effects apply?**  
  A: No — ignore all Life Loss effects and related React powers.

- **Q: What if I draw an Artifact with “Gain ? equal to ? of one rival”?**  
  A: During setup, immediately discard it and draw a replacement.

- **Q: Are Monuments and PoPs reused between games?**  
  A: Yes — unclaimed PoPs stay in play; claimed PoPs flip to opposite side if not yet scored. If already scored, remove from game.

- **Q: Do I keep all Artifacts between games?**  
  A: Only unplayed ones (in hand, deck, or discard). You refresh deck by adding new draws to reach 11, then discard 3.

- **Q: Is there an opponent?**  
  A: No — this is a solo campaign variant. You play alone against the clock (round limit).
