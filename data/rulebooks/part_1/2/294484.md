### 3. Setup  
1. **Choose Battlefield**: Place the map on the table. Ensure it has two starting spaces (labeled 1 and 2) unless playing team mode (requires four starting spaces).  
2. **Select Heroes**: Each player chooses a hero and takes all associated components.  
3. **Set Health**: Adjust health dials to starting values listed on the character card. Sidekicks without dials have 1 health each.  
4. **Form Deck**: Shuffle the 30 action cards into a deck. Draw 5 cards to form starting hand.  
5. **Place Fighters**:  
   - **Younger player** places hero in space **1**, then places sidekicks in separate spaces within the same zone(s) as the hero.  
   - **Older player** places hero in space **2**, then places sidekicks using the same rules.  
6. **First Turn**: Younger player takes the first turn.

> *Note: No start-of-game decisions are required in this set.*

After completing both actions:

- Opponent takes their turn.  

Turns alternate until one hero is defeated.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Spaces and Zones  
- The battlefield consists of circular **spaces**, each holding one fighter.  
- Connected spaces are **adjacent**. Adjacency determines melee attack range.  
- Spaces are grouped into **zones** (by color/pattern). Zones determine ranged attack eligibility.  
- A space with multiple patterns belongs to multiple zones.  

#### Secret Passages (Baskerville Manor)  
- Marked with a • symbol and white line.  
- Non-large fighters may move between any two secret passage spaces as if adjacent.  
- Costs 1 movement point.  
- Does **not** create adjacency for attacks or other effects.  
- Large figures cannot use them (not applicable in this set).

#### Maneuver Action  
1. **Draw a Card** (mandatory):  
   - Draw the top card of your deck.  
   - If your deck is empty (**fighters are exhausted**), each of your fighters takes 2 damage.  
2. **Move Fighters** (optional):  
   - Move each fighter up to their **Move** value (listed on character card).  
   - Movement rules:  
     - Each step must be to an adjacent space or via secret passage.  
     - Cannot move through or end on enemy fighters.  
     - May move through friendly fighters, but cannot end on them.  
     - Order of movement is player’s choice; complete one fighter’s move before starting another.  

##### Boost Movement  
- Discard 1 card from hand to add its **BOOST value** (lower-right circle) to all fighters’ movement this turn.  
- Ignore any card effects; only BOOST value matters.  
- Cards for defeated fighters may still be discarded to boost.

#### Scheme Action  
- Play a **scheme card** (marked with **𝕊**) from your hand.  
- Declare which fighter is playing it (must be allowed by card).  
- Resolve the effect.  
- Discard the card.  

#### Attack Action  
Must have at least one valid target and an attack/versatile card in hand.

**Step 1: Declare Target**  
- **Melee attacks** (⊙): Target must be in an adjacent space.  
- **Ranged attacks** (→): Target may be adjacent OR in the same zone (any space), regardless of adjacency.  
- Secret passages do **not** count as adjacency for attacks.

**Step 2: Choose and Reveal Cards**  
- Attacker plays an **attack or versatile** card face down (must be usable by attacking fighter).  
- Defender may respond with a **defense or versatile** card face down (must be usable by defending fighter).  
- Reveal both cards simultaneously.

**Step 3: Resolve Combat**  
1. **Immediate Effects**: Resolve in order — **defender first**, then attacker.  
2. **During Combat Effects**: Same order — **defender first**, then attacker.  
3. **Determine Damage**:  
   - Attacker deals damage = Attack value − Defense value (minimum 0).  
   - Apply damage to defender’s health dial.  
4. **Check Fighter Status**:  
   - If health reaches 0, fighter is **defeated**.  
   - If **hero** is defeated → player loses immediately.  
5. **After Combat Effects**: Resolve in order — **defender first**, then attacker.  
   - These resolve even if the fighter was defeated during combat.  
6. **Winning the Combat**:  
   - **Attacker wins** if at least 1 damage was dealt from the attack (not from effects).  
   - **Defender wins** if no attack damage was dealt (even if damage came from effects).  
7. **Discard Cards**: All played cards go to their respective discard piles.

#### Versatile Cards  
- May be used as **attack** or **defense** cards.  
- Count as both types for game effects.

#### Invisible Man: Fog Mechanics  
- At setup, place 3 fog tokens on separate spaces in your starting zone (like sidekicks).  
- **Defense Bonus**: When Invisible Man plays a defense card while on a space with a fog token, **+1 to defense value**.  
  - Not a card effect; cannot be canceled.  
- **Fog Movement**: Invisible Man may move between spaces with fog tokens as if adjacent (costs 1 movement).  
  - Normal movement rules apply (cannot end on enemies, etc.).  
- **Moving Fog Tokens**:  
  - May be moved like fighters, but:  
    - Can move through any fighter or token.  
    - Can occupy the same space as enemy fighters or other tokens.  
    - Only one fog token per space.  
  - Spaces with fog remain in their original zones for ranged attacks.

#### Special Abilities  
- Listed on character card.  
- Trigger as specified (e.g., after combat, during setup, etc.).  
- Resolve after all card effects unless otherwise stated.

#### Discard Piles  
- Maintain face-up discard pile.  
- Both players may examine it at any time.  
- Do **not** reshuffle into deck when empty.

#### Exhaustion  
- When deck is empty, fighters are **exhausted**.  
- If you must draw a card while exhausted, **each of your fighters takes 2 damage**.  
- No reshuffling.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **No scoring system**.  
- **Game ends immediately** when a player’s **hero reaches 0 health**.  
- That player **loses**, their opponent **wins**.  
- In **team play**, both opposing heroes must be defeated to win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I skip an action on my turn?**  
A: No. You must take exactly two actions.

**Q: Can I move a fighter zero spaces during Maneuver?**  
A: Yes.

**Q: Can I attack with a sidekick?**  
A: Yes, if the card allows it and the sidekick is the active fighter.

**Q: What happens if I have no cards in hand and must attack?**  
A: You cannot take the Attack action unless you have a valid attack/versatile card.

**Q: Can fog tokens block line of sight or movement?**  
A: No. Only Invisible Man interacts with them. Other fighters ignore fog tokens.

**Q: Can I boost movement using a card that can’t be legally played (e.g., hero defeated)?**  
A: Yes. Any card may be discarded for its BOOST value.

**Q: Do secret passages allow ranged attacks across zones?**  
A: No. Secret passages only affect movement. Ranged attacks require same zone.

**Q: Can I place a fog token on a space with an enemy?**  
A: Yes.

**Q: If a sidekick is defeated, can I still use their cards?**  
A: No. Cards requiring the sidekick cannot be played once they are defeated.
