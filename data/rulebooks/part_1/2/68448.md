4. **Gameplay Flow**  
The game is played over 3 Ages. Each Age consists of 6 or 7 turns (depending on expansions).  
- **Leader Phase (Leaders only)**: Before Age I, players draft 4 Leader cards.  
- **Recruitment Phase (Leaders only)**: Before each Age, players simultaneously choose and resolve one Leader action.  
- **Card Drafting Phase**:  
  - Age I: Pass cards left (clockwise)  
  - Age II: Pass cards right (counter-clockwise)  
  - Age III: Pass cards left (clockwise)  
  - In the 6th turn, players receive 2 cards, choose one, discard the other (no 3 coins).  
- **Each Turn**:  
  1. Choose a card from hand (simultaneously).  
  2. Reveal and take one action:  
     a. Build the card (pay cost)  
     b. Build a Wonder stage (pay Wonder cost)  
     c. Discard for 3 coins  
  3. Pass remaining cards to next player.  
- **End of Age**:  
  - Resolve military conflicts.  
  - Resolve Great Projects (if applicable).  
  - Resolve Naval conflicts (Armada).  
  - Begin next Age.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Resource Production**:  
  - Resources come from Wonder board, brown, gray, and some yellow cards.  
  - Resources are not spent; they are available every turn.  
- **Commerce**:  
  - Buy missing resources from neighbors at 2 coins each.  
  - Cannot buy resources from yellow cards or Wonders (unless specified).  
  - Must have coins at start of turn to buy.  
- **Chaining**:  
  - Some cards can be built for free if prerequisite card from previous Age is owned.  
- **Wonder Construction**:  
  - Must build stages left to right.  
  - Pay cost shown on Wonder board, not on card used as marker.  
  - Marker card has no effect.  
- **Expansions Add**:  
  - **Leaders**: Recruit for cost, use as Wonder marker, or discard for 3 coins.  
  - **Cities**: Black cards grant effects. Debt tokens (–1 VP each) for unpaid coin losses. Diplomacy tokens let player skip conflicts.  
  - **Tower of Babel**: Discard a card to build a Babel tile. Tiles are placed after all turns; only 3–4 visible at once.  
  - **Great Projects**: Pay extra cost to contribute. Success: participants gain rewards. Failure: non-participants take penalties.  
  - **Armada**: Pay extra cost to advance fleet ships. Naval conflicts resolve globally.  
  - **Edifice**: Contribute during Wonder construction. Reward if project completed.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
Game ends after Age III. Score in this order:  
1. **Military Conflicts**: Sum Victory (+1/+3/+5 per win) and Defeat (–1 per loss) tokens.  
2. **Treasury**: 1 VP per 3 coins (leftovers ignored).  
3. **Wonders**: Sum VP from built stages.  
4. **Civilian Structures**: Sum VP from blue cards.  
5. **Scientific Structures**:

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**

- **Free construction?** Still counts as building; cannot duplicate card.  
- **Trading**: Can buy from both neighbors; must use same turn.  
- **Chaining**: Only from previous Age.  
- **Diplomacy Token**: Skip conflict; neighbors become adjacent. Use one per conflict.  
- **Debt**: Taken when unable to pay coin loss; permanent –1 VP each.

- **Great Projects**: Can contribute only if card color matches project; can only take 1 token per turn.  
- **Armada**: Naval strength includes cards, ships, and Wonders.

- **Free City (2P)**: Neutral player controlled alternately; follows normal rules but no Leaders or Babel.
