## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Players are wine producers in Portugal competing to earn the most Victory Points (VP) over 6 years by developing vineyards, producing high-quality wines, selling and exporting wine, hiring experts, and succeeding at wine fairs.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each year consists of:
1. **Start of Year** (Years 2–6 only):
   - Discard previous Vintage tile, reveal new one.
   - In Years 4 and 6, flip all face-down Wine Expert and Magnate Action tiles face-up.
2. **Actions Phase**:
   - Each player takes two actions in turn order.
   - On each turn, move Action Marker to a different space and perform its action, paying movement costs.
   - Before or after action (not during), may use one Wine Expert ability or flip one Magnate Action tile.
   - After first action, revise player order if Pass/Press Release was used.
3. **Maintenance Phase**:
   - Advance Year Marker to (B).
   - Each player retrieves one barrel from the Sales Area.
4. **Production Phase**:
   - Advance Year Marker to Production.
   - Age wine: shift all wine tiles one slot right; discard those with no space.
   - Optionally reassign Enologists and Farmers.
   - Produce one wine per estate with a vineyard:
     - Quality = +2 per vineyard +1 per farmer +1 per winery +2 per enologist ± weather (from Vintage tile)
     - For Douro, may spend a Porto tile to add +3 quality.
     - If quality > 0, place matching wine tile in leftmost warehouse slot.
5. **Fair Phase** (Years 3, 5, 6 only):
   - Any player who hasn’t issued a Press Release must do so now.
   - Resolve Fair:
     - Rank players by cumulative Fair Points.
     - Award VPs based on placement (see VP table).
     - In 2P: award 1st and 3rd place; in 4P: 4th place gets a Wine Expert.
     - Tie: split VP (rounded down); if tie for last in 4P, all get a Wine Expert.
   - Set new player order based on Fair Booth order (left to right).
   - Move booth discs back to Fair logo.
   - Buy Magnate tiles: in new order, discard one wine to take one Magnate Action or Multiplier tile.

     - No duplicates allowed.
   - Refill display from combined deck.

### 5. Core Mechanics
