### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Wonderland's War*, players take on the roles of iconic Wonderlandian leaders—such as the Red Queen, Alice, or the Jabberwock—racing to restore their vision of Wonderland after it has lost its whimsy and descended into madness. Each leader wages war across five regions, gathering allies, forging powerful artifacts, and completing quests to gain Victory Points (VP). The game is played over three rounds, each consisting of a Tea Party phase and a War phase. The player with the most VP at the end of the third War phase wins and becomes the new ruler of Wonderland. In case of a tie, the player with the fewest Madness Shards wins; if still tied, the player with the most units on the board wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds over three rounds. Each round consists of:
1. **Tea Party Phase**: Players take turns moving their Leader clockwise around the Tea Party table, selecting cards to gain resources (units, chips, abilities, etc.). The phase ends when all players have taken 4 cards (5 in 2-player) and placed their Leader in a region.
2. **War Phase**: Battles occur in each region clockwise from the Starting Battle Standee. Players draw chips from their bags to gain strength; madness chips risk unit loss and busting. After each battle, players score rewards, forge chips, and resolve wagers.
3. **End of War Phase**: If not Round III, reset for next round: move Starting Battle Standee, refill bags, return Leaders to Head of Table, refresh Wonderlandian market, and prepare next Tea Party.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Tea Party Phase
- On your turn, move your Leader clockwise to any unoccupied chair with a card.
- Take all benefits shown: place units, gain chips, unlock abilities, etc.
- If you pass the Head of Table, stop, roll the Shard Die, gain that many Shards, refill empty card spaces, then continue.
- You may take up to 4 cards (5 in 2-player); on your fifth action, place your Leader in a region.
- Leader-specific abilities:
  - **Alice**: Move counterclockwise.
  - **Cheshire Cat**: When rolling 2 or 3 on Shard Die, give 1 Shard to any player.
  - **Jabberwock**: At start of your turn, place 1 Poison chip on any card (if none on table).
  - **Mad Hatter**: Once per phase, refill all empty card spaces and take any card without moving.
  - **Red Queen**: May place Supporters from one card into multiple regions.

#### War Phase
- **Battle Order**: Start at Starting Battle Standee, proceed clockwise.
- **Starting Strength**: Sum Leader Strength, Wonderlandian Strength, and +2 for Castle.
- **First Draw**: All players simultaneously draw and reveal a chip.
- **Subsequent Draws**: Players draw a chip or halt (reveal empty hand).
- **Madness Chips**:
  - Place on Madness Track.
  - Lose 1 or 2 units (as shown).
  - If no units remain, you **bust**: reduce strength to 0, move Active chips to Exhausted, flip Shield to unbroken.
- **Shield**: May block one Madness effect by flipping from unbroken to broken; chip returns to bag.
- **Other Chips**: Advance on Battle Track by chip strength; place on Active Chips row.
- **Halting**: May halt after first draw; cannot draw again. Halting players remain eligible for rewards.
- **Victory Conditions**:
  - Any player reaches 25+ on Battle Track → immediate win.
  - All but one player halted/busted and remaining player is in lead → battle ends.
- **Battle Outcome** (for non-busted players):
  1. **Region Victory**: Highest strength gains VP and places Castle. Second place gains half VP.
  2. **Ties**: Tied for 1st choose VP or Castle; no 2nd place. Tied for 2nd split half VP.
  3. **Uncontested**: Choose VP or Castle.
  4. **Quests**: Complete Feat if conditions met; place card face-up.
  5. **Faction & Wonderlandian Abilities**: Resolve end-of-battle effects.
  6. **Forging**: May forge once per Forge symbol under final position, and once per Forge chip in Active row.
     - Choose any Active chip to forge.
     - Place on leftmost empty space of a Forge track.
     - Gain reward (e.g., +1 Leader Strength, +2 Supporters, discard Madness, etc.).
     - Completing a track grants a Faction Artifact chip.
  7. **Wagers**: Non-participants may wager on winner. Correct = weak Ally chip; incorrect = 1 Shard.
  8. **Cleanup**: Move Active chips to Exhausted; reset Battle Track.

#### End of War Phase
- Roll Shard Die; move Starting Battle Standee clockwise.
- Return all Exhausted and Madness chips to bag.
- Supporters and Wonderlandians remain in regions.
- Place Leader at Head of Table.
- Shuffle and refresh Wonderlandian market.
- Prepare next Tea Party.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
After Round III War Phase:
1. **Base VP**: Score from position on VP track.
2. **Castles**: 3–6 VP each, based on progress on bottom Forge track.
3. **Quests**: 
   - 3 VP for completed Feat.
   - 3 VP for completed Objective.
   - +3 VP bonus if both completed (9 VP total per quest).
4. **Penalty**: -1 VP per Madness Shard.
5. **Winner**: Highest total VP wins. Tiebreaker: fewest Shards → most units on board.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Empty Bag**: If bag is empty when drawing, return all Exhausted and Madness chips to bag.
- **Shield Flip**: Only flipped to unbroken when busting, using certain abilities, or drafting the shield symbol.
- **Poison Chips**: Drawn → lose 1 Supporter, return to Jabberwock. Can be blocked by Shield. Do not go on Madness Track.
- **Jabberwock Poison**: Limited supply (players + 2). Can place only if supply available.
- **Quest Objectives**: Components can be used for multiple objectives.
- **Halting**: Allowed from second draw onward. Halting players still score.
- **Forging**: Possible even if Forge chip is removed by end-of-battle ability, as long as you had one.
- **Two-Player Rules**:
  - One region is removed; no battles there.
  - Local Resistance token sets minimum strength to win.
  - Castles must be won twice (placed sideways, then upright).
  - Tea Party: 5 cards instead of 4.
  - Each player starts with extra Forge chip.
