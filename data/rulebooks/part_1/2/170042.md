2. Resolve action (if desired).  
3. Pick up a *different* worker from another space.  
4. Resolve that action (if desired).  

Players always end their turn holding one worker.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### A. WORK – Village Actions  
Worker color affects some actions. Only one action per building per turn (except Long House).

| Building       | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| **Gate House** | Draw 2 Townsfolk cards. |
| **Town Hall**  | Play 1 card from hand (resolve its Town Hall action). |
| **Treasury**   | Discard 1 card → gain 2 Silver, or discard 2 cards → gain 1 Gold. |
| **Barracks**   | Hire 1 Crew from hand (pay Silver cost). Max 5 Crew. May discard a Crew before hiring. |
| **Armoury**    | Pay 1 Iron → gain 2 Armour, or pay 2 Silver → gain 1 Armour. Max 10 Armour. |
| **Mill**       | Black Worker: 1 Provision; Grey: 2 Provisions; White: 2 Provisions or 1 Gold. |
| **Silversmith**| Black Worker: 3 Silver; Grey/White: 2 Silver. |
| **Long House** | Choose one: <br> - Pay 1 Livestock → gain 2 Provisions <br> - Pay Plunder/Silver as shown → take an Offering Tile (immediately replace from stack). |
| **Mead Hall**  | Choose one: <br> - **Charm the Crowd**: Take 1 face-up Townsfolk card + any Silver/Mead shown. Slide cards right, refill leftmost. <br> - **Complete a Quest**: Discard cards from hand totaling ≥ Military Strength on Quest. Gain reward, place Quest tile above player board. |

#### B. RAID – Raiding a Settlement  
To raid, you must:  
- Have enough Hired Crew  
- Pay required Provisions and Gold (if any)  
- Use correct Worker color (White/Grey)  

**Steps**:  
1. Place your Worker on an empty spot in the raiding space.  
2. Pay Provisions and Gold to supply.  
3. Roll dice (1 or 2, as shown).  
4. Calculate **Military Strength**:  
   - Dice result  
   + Hired Crew Strength (top-left of card)  
   + Crew Actions (e.g., +X vs specific raid)  
   + Armour  
   + Mead (optional: spend 1 Mead = +1 Strength, max 8 Mead held)  
5. Score VP based on Military Strength benchmarks (e.g., ≥12 = 4 VP). Harbours always give 1 VP.  
6. Gain **Crew Bonuses**: Additional VP from Crew cards (e.g., “+2 VP when raiding Fortresses”).  
7. Pick up:  
   - 1 Worker (White/Grey)  
   - 1 set of Plunder (Gold, Iron, Livestock)  
   - Valkyrie Tokens (if present)  
   - Jarl Tokens (if present)  
8. **Resolve Jarl Encounters (if any)**:  
   - Reveal one Jarl card per Jarl Token.  
   - Resolve in order: **All Kills → All Subdues → All Flees**.  
     - **Kill**: Take Wounds = Jarl Strength +1. Gain 2 Fame. Gain Kill reward.  
     - **Subdue**: Take Wounds = Jarl Strength –1. Pay Silver cost. Add Jarl to Crew (not hand).  
     - **Flee**: Discard Jarl. Lose 1 Fame or 1 VP.  
   - Place Jarl Token on Encounter Board.  
9. **Resolve Valkyrie**:  
   - For each Valkyrie token, discard 1 Hired Crew (player’s choice).  
   - Move Valkyrie Track marker up 1 per Valkyrie.  
   - Excess Valkyrie beyond available Crew are discarded with no benefit.  
10. **Place Quest Tile**: Draw 1 Quest Tile and place it on the raided space (only once per space).  

**Wounds**:  
- Each Crew can take up to its printed Military Strength in Wounds.  
- Each Wound reduces Crew’s Strength by 1 in future raids.  
- Wounded Crew are not removed unless killed (by Valkyrie, Avenger, etc.).  
- Cannot wound or kill a Jarl on the same turn it was subdued.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Trigger (Any One):  
- Only 1 Fortress raid space remains unraided  
- Offering Tile draw pile is empty  
- No Valkyrie tokens left on board  

When triggered:  
- Current player finishes turn.  
- All players (including current) get **1 final turn**.  

#### Final Scoring (Add to VP Track):  
1. **Tracks**:  
   - Valkyrie Track: VP based on level (e.g., 7 = 15 VP)  
   - Armour Track: VP based on level (e.g., 10 = 15 VP)  
   - Fame Track: VP based on level (e.g., 6 = 12 VP)  
2. **Offering Tiles**: Reveal and sum VP values.  
3. **Hired Crew**: Sum end-game VP bonuses (bottom-left of cards).  
4. **Jarl Cards**: Sum end-game VP bonuses (if in Crew).  
5. **Quests & Reputation**:  
   - Rightmost Quest/Reputation tile above player board determines VP (per tile).  
6. **Plunder**:  
   - 1 Gold = 1 VP  
   - 1 Iron = 1 VP  
   - Every 2 Livestock = 1 VP (1 Livestock = 0 VP)  

**Total VP = VP Track + all end-game bonuses**

#### Tiebreakers:  
1. Highest on Valkyrie Track  
2. Highest on Armour Track
