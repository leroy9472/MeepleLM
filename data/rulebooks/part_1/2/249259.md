## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
War Chest is an asymmetric strategy game for two players set in a medieval-inspired conflict. Each player commands a unique faction with specialized military units. The objective is to gain control of the battlefield by strategically deploying and maneuvering units to claim neutral locations. Victory is achieved by being the first to place all six of your Control Markers on the board.

### 2. Components
- Game board (light hexes used for 2-player; dark outer hexes for 4-player only)
- 2 player bags
- 2 Royal Coins (one per player, faction-matched)
- 12 Control Markers (6 per player, faction-matched)
- Unit Cards (16 base + expansion options)
- Unit Coins (matching each drafted unit)
- Initiative Marker (double-sided, faction-matched)
- (Optional - Nobility Expansion) 7 Royal Decree Cards, 6 Proclamation Seals (3 per player)
- (Optional - Siege Expansion) 6 Fortification Cards, 7 Fortification Coins

### 3. Setup
**For 2 Players:**
- Place the board with only the central light hexes in play (ignore dark outer hexes).
- Each player:
  - Chooses a faction and takes matching bag, Royal Coin, and 6 Control Markers.
  - Places Royal Coin into their bag.
  - Places one Control Marker on each of their two starting locations (marked with faction icon).
- **Optional Expansions:**
  - *Nobility*: Shuffle 7 Royal Decree Cards, reveal 3 face-up. Give each player 3 matching Proclamation Seals.
  - *Siege*: Shuffle 6 Fortification Cards, draw one to place 4 Fortification Coins. Place remaining 3 in supply.
- **Army Assembly (choose one method):**
  - *Beginner*: Use preset sets (e.g., Player A: Swordsman, Pikeman, Crossbowman, Light Cavalry; Player B: Archer, Cavalry, Lancer, Scout).
  - *Random*: Deal 4 random Unit Cards to each player.
  - *Draft*: Deal 8 random Unit Cards face-up. Drafting order: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 2, P1 takes 2, P2 takes 2, P1 takes 1. Player who picked second gains Initiative Marker.
- Each player places 2 coins of each drafted unit and their Royal Coin into their bag. Remaining unit coins form supply beside cards.

- Flip Initiative Marker to determine starting player (place marker in front of them).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of two phases, repeated until game end:

**Phase 1: Draw Coins**
- Simultaneously, each player draws 3 coins from their bag.
- If the bag has fewer than 3 coins:
  1. Draw all remaining coins.
  2. Shuffle all coins from discard pile into the bag.
  3. Draw remaining needed coins.

**Phase 2: Use Coins (Alternate Turns)**
- Starting with the player holding the Initiative Marker, players alternate taking one action per coin until all 3 coins are used.
- Actions are taken one at a time; players alternate after each single action.
- Available actions depend on how the coin is played:

**Placement Actions (coin placed face-up on board):**
- *Deploy*: Place a unit coin on an empty location you control. Only one unit (or stack) of each type may be on the board at a time.
- *Bolster*: Place a matching unit coin on top of an existing unit of the same type. Stacks can grow indefinitely and move/attack as a single unit.

**Face-Down Discard Actions (coin discarded face-down):**
- *Claim Initiative*: Take the Initiative Marker. This can only happen once per round. If already holding it, you cannot claim again.
- *Recruit*: Discard any coin face-down, then take any one unit coin from your supply and place it face-up in your discard pile.
- *Pass*: Discard any coin face-down. This passes only that turn; you may still use remaining coins.

**Face-Up Discard Actions ("Maneuvers" – coin discarded face-up):**
- *Move*: Move a matching unit one space to an adjacent unoccupied location. Entire stack moves together.
- *Control*: If a matching unit occupies a control location (green knotwork), place one of your Control Markers there. If opponent controls it, return their marker to them first.
- *Attack*: Target an adjacent enemy unit with a matching unit. Remove one coin from the target:
  - If unbolstered (single coin), remove it permanently.
  - If bolstered (stack), remove only the top coin.
  - If location has a Fortification (Siege expansion), attack and remove it first before attacking units.
- *Tactic*: Execute the ability described on a matching unit’s card. Some units require specific conditions (e.g., bolstered for Siege Tactics).
- *Proclaim* (Nobility expansion only): Discard your Royal Coin face-up. Choose one of the three face-up Royal Decree Cards that doesn’t have your seal, place your seal on it, and execute its ability. Each decree can be used once per faction.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Control Markers**: Required to deploy units. Placed via Control action. Game ends when a player places their 6th.
- **Coin Economy**: Coins drawn randomly from bag. Used to activate actions. Recycled from discard pile when bag is empty.
- **Unit Stacks (Bolstering)**: Units can be stacked for durability. Only top coin is removed when attacked.
- **Initiative**: Determines turn order. Can be claimed once per round via face-down discard. Holder of marker goes first each round.
- **Fortifications (Siege Expansion)**:
  - Block enemy unit entry.
  - Must be destroyed before attacking units in the same space.
  - Can be rebuilt by Sapper unit using supply.
- **Royal Decrees (Nobility Expansion)**:
  - Shared pool of 3 face-up decrees.
  - Activated by discarding Royal Coin and placing Proclamation Seal.
  - Effects are one-time per faction.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- There is no scoring system. The game is won by achieving a single victory condition:
  - **Victory Condition**: The first player to place their sixth and final Control Marker wins immediately.
- The game ends as soon as the last Control Marker is placed, even mid-round.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you control an opponent’s starting location?**  
  Yes. Starting locations can be captured like any other location by using a Control action.

- **Can a unit with multi-hex movement move through an occupied hex?**  
  No. Each movement step must be to an adjacent unoccupied hex. Units cannot move through or over other units.

- **Can Archers or Lancers make normal attacks?**  
  - *Archer*: No. Can only attack via its Tactic (range 2).
  - *Lancer*: No. Can only attack via its Tactic (must move 2 spaces and attack).

- **When multiple attributes trigger from one event, in what order do they resolve?**  
  The active player chooses the order. Each effect must fully resolve before the next begins.

- **Does the Mercenary’s attribute trigger when recruited via Enlist Degree (Nobility)?**  
  Yes. The attribute triggers whenever a Mercenary coin is recruited, regardless of method.

- **Can a Siege Tactic be used if the unit becomes unbolstered during execution?**  
  Yes. The requirement is that the unit is bolstered when the action is initiated (coin discarded).

- **What happens if the War Wagon’s attribute triggers when a unit is damaged by the Pikeman’s ability?**  
  No. The War Wagon only triggers when an adjacent unit is *attacked*, not when it loses a coin due to an ability.

- **Can the Royal Coin be played face-up without Nobility expansion?**  
  Only via the Royal Guard’s Tactic (which requires discarding the Royal Coin to move the Royal Guard).
