### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Beyond the Sun*, humanity has just developed the technology to travel beyond the solar system. Players represent competing factions expanding across space by researching technologies, exploring and colonizing star systems, and claiming achievements. The goal is to earn the most victory points through technological advancement, colonization, and completing objectives.

The game ends when the required number of achievement discs are claimed (4 in a 4-player game, 3 in 2- or 3-player games). After triggering the endgame, players complete the current round and one additional full round before final scoring.

### 2. Components
- Technology Board with spaces for Level 1–4 techs
- Exploration Board representing space with system slots
- Player faction mats
- Population and ore production discs
- Resource cubes (used as population, ore, ships, and supply)
- Action pawns
- Technology cards (4 colors: Blue, Green, Red, Yellow) by level
- System cards (A and B decks, including starting systems)
- Achievement cards (Empire, Transcendence, and random A/B)
- Event cards (Level 2 and 3)
- Guild cover tiles
- Deep Space area
- Outpost discs (population or ore production discs used as control markers)

### 3. Setup
**Technology Board:**
- Place 4 random Level 1 technology cards face-up.
- Shuffle Level 2 and Level 3 event cards: Mix 2 mandatory event cards with 4 random cards of each level, then place 6 face-down cards on each Level 2 and Level 3 tech space.
- Place 4 Guild cover tiles on the tech board.
- Shuffle face-up Level 4 techs as needed.

**Exploration Board:**
- Place 2 random starting A systems and 2 random B systems face-up.
- Shuffle remaining A and B system decks separately.

**Achievements:**
- Place Empire and Transcendence achievements face-up.
- Shuffle Achievement Deck A and place 1 face-up; same for Deck B.

**Player Setup (per player):**
- Receive faction mat and place 8 population and 8 ore production discs beside it.
- Fill supply columns with supply-side-up resource cubes.
- Place 2 population cubes in supply (population-side-up).
- Place 1 level-1 spaceship on Sol.
- Place action pawn on Basic Spacefaring tech space.
- 1st and 2nd players receive 1 ore; 3rd and 4th players receive 2 ore.
- Randomly choose starting player.

**Player Count Adjustments:**
- **3 players:** Use modified Basic Spacefaring tech; block Achievement A slot 2; game ends at 3 achievements.
- **2 players:** Use 2-player exploration board; only 1 starting A system; do not use Disciples of the Cosmic Tabernacle faction mat.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each player’s turn consists of three phases:

**1. Action Phase:**
- Move your action pawn to an unoccupied space on the Technology Board.
- You must have researched the technology to use its action.
- Perform the action listed, paying all required costs.

Available actions include:
- **Research Level 1 Tech:** Pay 1 population. Gain immediate effect. Multiple players can research the same tech.
- **Research Level 2 Tech:** Pay 2 ore + 1 population (3rd/4th player pays +1 ore). Must have prerequisites. For undiscovered techs: resolve event card, then choose from 2 valid color-matched options.
- **Build Ship:** Pay 1 population to convert to level-1 ship. Place on Sol or controlled Shipyard. Then perform up to 2 jumps (split among ships).
- **Gain Population:** Convert leftmost supply cube to population and gain 1 ore.

**2. Production Phase (choose one):**
- **Population Growth:** Gain 1 population from each supply column where the population track has no disc below it (i.e., unlocked).
- **Ore Production:** Gain 1 ore for each uncovered ore symbol on your ore track.
- **Resource Trade (unlimited):**
  - Pay 3 ore → gain 1 population
  - Pay 1 ore → convert 1 ship to population
  - Return 1 population → gain 1 ore

**3. Achievement Phase:**
- If you meet the conditions for any achievement, you **must** claim one (only one per turn).
- Each achievement can be claimed only once per player.

After all players have taken a turn, the round ends. Play continues until the endgame condition is met.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Technology Research:**
- Eye icon: Only research already discovered tech.
- New discovery: Tech must match color of at least one prerequisite. Draw until 2 valid options, then choose one.
- Immediate effects apply to all eligible players.

**Ship Movement & Control:**
- Jumps: Up to 2 jumps per ship movement action. Can be split among ships.
- Control: Player with highest total ship strength controls a system (not Sol or Deep Space).
- Place matching production disc (population or ore) as outpost.
- If control is lost, return outpost to rightmost empty space on corresponding track.
- Control bonuses trigger when gaining control, even on others’ turns.

**Colonization:**
- Only allowed on Star Systems (not Shipyard Systems).
- Requirements: Control the system and total ship strength ≥ colonization power.
- Return ships with total strength ≥ colonization power to rightmost supply columns (no change given).
- Remaining ships (yours and opponents’) go to Deep Space.
- Take system card and outpost; place second production disc (matching or different type) to form colony.
- Gain colonization bonus.
- Refill system slot with new card from deck (if empty, draw from other deck).

**Automation:**
- Move population or ore production disc from leftmost space to automation track.
- Increases production capacity.
- If no discs remain, use achievement discs as proxies (not counted for achievements).

**Resource Management:**
- Gain population from leftmost available supply column.
- Return population to rightmost available supply column.
- If supply columns are full, place excess next to Column A.
- If out of supply cubes, use population cubes as substitutes.

**Events & Guilds:**
- Level 2 and 3 event cards are revealed when researching undiscovered techs.
- Two Level 2 events unlock Level 1 guild spaces; two Level 3 events unlock Level 2 guild spaces.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Endgame Trigger:**
- 4 achievement discs claimed (4-player); 3 discs (2- or 3-player).
- Finish current round, then play one additional full round.
- Final scoring occurs after.

**Scoring (refer to player aid):**
- Points from:
  - Colonized systems (VP value on card)
  - Technologies researched (VP on card)
  - Achievements claimed
  - Automated production discs
  - Other bonuses

**Tiebreaker:**
1. Fewest total remaining population and ore production discs
2. Most remaining population
3. Most remaining ore

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Multiple players research same tech:** Allowed. All gain immediate effects.
- **Cannot perform chosen action:** Must choose a different action space if possible.
- **Jump movement:** Can be split; must complete all jumps before checking control.
- **Control tie:** Current controller retains control.
- **Leaving a system:** If you leave and no one else has higher strength, you keep control. If another player now has highest strength, they gain control and place outpost. If tied, no one gains control.
- **Colonizing with excess ships:** Allowed. Extra ships go to Deep Space.
- **Out of production discs:** Use achievement discs as proxies for automation or colony discs.
- **Drawing system cards:** If one deck is empty, draw from the other.
- **Private technologies:** Some system cards grant unique techs. Only that player can use them; score VPs at end.
