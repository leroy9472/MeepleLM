# Concordia Venus — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Concordia Venus*, players take on the role of Roman traders expanding their commercial empire across the provinces of the Roman world. By strategically deploying colonists, establishing trading houses, and leveraging specialized personnel, players grow their influence and wealth. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VP) through expansion, production, trade, and card acquisition.

The game ends when a player builds their 15th house or purchases the last personality card. That player takes the Concordia card (7 VP), and all other players take one final turn before scoring.

#### Personality Card Actions  

**Architect (Jupiter)**  
- Move your colonists:  
  - Land colonists move on brown land routes.  
  - Sea colonists move on blue sea routes.  
  - Total movement steps = total number of your colonists on the board.  
  - Colonists may not end movement on a line occupied by another colonist.  
- After movement, optionally build:  
  - In any city adjacent to your colonist.  
  - Pay cost shown on reference card.  
  - If other players have houses in the city: multiply money cost by (1 + number of existing houses). Goods cost unchanged.  
  - Cannot build in the capital.  
  - Cannot build more than one house per city.  
  - In Team Play: a colonist still inside a city cannot build.

**Prefect (Saturn)**

- A) Choose a province with a face-up bonus token (goods side).  
  - Collect one good of that type.  
  - Flip the token to coin side.  
  - All houses in that province (any owner) produce 1 unit of their city’s good for their owner.  
  - With Praefectus Magnus: collect 2 goods (instead of 1). Pass the card counterclockwise.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Trigger  
Game ends immediately when:  
- A player builds their 15th house, OR  
- A player purchases the last personality card.  

That player completes their turn and takes the **Concordia card (7 VP)**.  
All other players (Individual) or teams (Team Play) take **one final turn**.

#### Final Scoring  

##### Individual Play  
Score VP based on gods at bottom of each card:  
- **Vesta**: 1 VP per 10 sestertii (round down) + value of goods in storehouse  
- **Jupiter**: 1 VP per card × number of non-brick cities with your house (max 15)  
- **Saturn**: 1 VP per card × number of provinces with at least 1 house (max 12)  
- **Venus**: 2 VP per card × number of provinces with at least 2 houses (max 14)  
- **Mercury**: 2 VP per card × number of different goods you produce (max 10)  
- **Mars**: 2 VP per card × number of colonists on board (max 12)  
- **Minerva**: 3–5 VP per card × number of cities producing the good on the card  

**Bonus**:  
- 7 VP for Concordia card  

**Tiebreaker**:  
1. Praefectus Magnus card holder  
2. Next player in turn order who would receive it

##### Team Play  
- Each player scores individually using same card-based gods.  
- **Legatus**: counts once for Jupiter, once for Saturn, once for Venus  
- **Venus**: 1 VP per card × number of provinces where **both teammates** have at least one house  
- Team total = sum of both players’ scores  
- Tiebreaker: same as individual
