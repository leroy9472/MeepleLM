## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Patchwork is a two-player strategy game where players sew together fabric patches to create quilts. The goal is to manage time and resources effectively—balancing button income and patch placement—to complete a quilt with the highest score. Victory is determined by combining remaining buttons and bonuses, then subtracting penalties for empty spaces.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Time Board (track with spaces, button icons, and special patch spaces)  
- 2 Quilt Boards (9×9 grids)  
- 2 Time Tokens (lime green and yellow)  
- 1 Neutral Token  
- 33 Patch Pieces (various shapes, each with button cost and time cost in hourglasses)  
- 5 Special Patches (1×1 leather patches)  
- 1 Special Tile (7×7 bonus, worth 7 points)  
- Button Tiles:  
  - 32 × "1 button"  
  - 12 × "5 buttons"  
  - 5 × "10 buttons"  
  - 1 × "20 buttons"  

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player takes:  
   - 1 Quilt Board  
   - 1 Time Token  
   - 5 Buttons (from supply)  
2. Place the Time Board in the center.  
3. Arrange all 33 patch pieces in a circle around the Time Board.  
4. Locate the 1×2 patch; place the Neutral Token between it and the next patch clockwise.  
5. Place the 5 Special Patches (1×1) on their marked spaces along the Time Board.  
6. Place the Special Tile (7×7) near the board.  
7. Both players place their Time Tokens on the starting space (entry space) of the Time Board.  
8. Determine first player: the player who most recently used a needle goes first.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- The player furthest behind on the Time Board takes their turn.  
- If both tokens are on the same space, the player whose token is on top goes first.  
- On your turn, choose one of two actions:  

#### A. Advance and Receive Buttons  
1. Move your Time Token clockwise until it is one space ahead of your opponent.  
2. Gain 1 button for each space moved.  

#### B. Buy and Place a Patch  
1. Choose one of the three patches immediately clockwise from the Neutral Token.  
2. Move the Neutral Token to sit next to the chosen patch (clockwise side).  
3. Pay the button cost shown on the patch to the supply.  
4. Place the patch on your Quilt Board:  
   - Align with grid  
   - May rotate in 90° increments  
   - May use either side  
   - Must not overlap or hang off the board  
   - Need not be adjacent to other patches  
5. Move your Time Token forward by the number of hourglasses (time cost) shown on the patch.  
6. If your token lands on the same space as your opponent’s, place yours on top.  

#### After Movement (Either Action):  
- **Button Income**: If your token passes a button icon, gain buttons equal to the total number of buttons shown on all patches currently on your Quilt Board.  
- **Special Patch**: If your token passes a special patch space, immediately take the 1×1 leather patch and place it on any empty space of your Quilt Board.  

#### Turn Continuation:  
- After buying a patch, if your Time Token is still behind your opponent’s (clockwise), you take another turn immediately.  
- Players do not alternate strictly; the trailing player always moves.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Neutral Token**: Always marks the next available patch. After a patch is taken, the token is placed next to it, making the next three clockwise patches available.  
- **Time Management**: Advancing gives immediate buttons; buying patches costs buttons but moves you forward in time, possibly triggering income or special patches.  
- **Quilt Placement**: Strategic placement is crucial to minimize empty spaces and potentially earn the 7×7 bonus.  
- **7×7 Special Tile**: The first player to completely fill any 7×7 area within their 9×9 quilt board takes the Special Tile, worth 7 points at game end.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when both players’ Time Tokens have reached or passed the final space of the Time Board.  
- Final Scoring:  
  - Count remaining buttons in your supply (not those on patches).  
  - Add 7 points if you have the Special Tile (7×7 bonus).  
  - Subtract 2 points for each empty space on your Quilt Board (of 81 total).  
- Total = (Remaining Buttons) + (7 if 7×7 completed) − (2 × Empty Spaces)  
- Highest score wins.  
- Tiebreaker: The player who reached the final space first wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move past the end?**  
  Yes, but your token stops at the last space. You still complete the action (e.g., placing a patch).  
- **Can I buy a patch I can’t fully pay for?**  
  No. You must have sufficient buttons to pay the full cost.  
- **What if I can’t afford any of the next 3 patches and I’m ahead?**  
  You must advance (if possible). If you’re already ahead and can’t buy, you skip your turn.  
- **Do I get button income when moving after buying a patch?**  
  Yes. Any space passed—including button and special patch spaces—triggers their effect.  
- **Can I rotate or flip patches?**  
  Yes. Any 90° rotation and either side up is allowed.  
- **What if both players complete 7×7 at the same time?**  
  Only the first to complete it takes the tile. Simultaneous completion is resolved by who triggered the condition first.  
- **Do button icons stack?**  
  Yes. Each time you pass a button income space, you gain buttons equal to the total button value of your placed patches.
