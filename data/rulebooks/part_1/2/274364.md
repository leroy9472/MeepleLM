## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Watergate*, one player takes the role of the **Newspaper Editor**, investigating the Nixon administration, while the other plays **President Nixon**, attempting to survive until the end of his term.  

**Editor’s Goal**: Connect **two informants** (face-up picture tiles) to Nixon via an uninterrupted chain of adjacent **face-up evidence tokens** on the Evidence Board.  
**Nixon’s Goal**: Accumulate **five momentum tokens** on his Momentum Card, or cause the game to require a momentum token when none remain in the supply.  

The game ends immediately when either condition is met.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has **three phases**:  

#### A. Initial Phase  
1. **Draw Cards**:  
   - Each player draws cards equal to the number shown on **their side** of the Initiative Card.  
   - If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
2. **Nixon Draws Evidence**:  
   - Nixon draws **3 evidence tokens** from the bag, looks at them, and places them **face-down** on space **0** of the Research Track.  
   - Nixon may look at face-down tokens at any time; Editor cannot.  

#### B. Card Phase  
Players alternate playing one card at a time, starting with the player who has **initiative** (arrow points to them).  

Each card has:  
- **Value** (top number, color-coded: blue, green, yellow)  
- **Action** (text below)  

##### Playing a Card for Value  
- Move **one token** (Initiative, Momentum, or Evidence) toward your side by the value shown.  
- If moving an **Evidence Token**, it must **match at least one color** on the card.  
- **Wild Cards**: Cards showing all three colors (e.g., "blue/green/yellow") are wild—choose any color.  

**Moving Face-Down Evidence Tokens**:  
- **As Nixon**: Look at face-down tokens, choose one matching the card’s color, flip it face-up, and move it.  
- **As Editor**: Ask Nixon if any face-down token matches a color on your card.  
  - If **yes**, Nixon chooses which matching token to flip and move toward you.  
  - If **no**, you may instead move:  
    - Initiative Token  
    - Momentum Token  
    - Or a **face-up** evidence token matching your card’s color  

**When a token reaches space 5 on your side**:  
- **Immediately gain it** and resolve:  
  - **Initiative Token**: Place on Initiative Card, arrow points to you.  
  - **Momentum Token**: Place on lowest empty space of your Momentum Card.  
    - **Editor**: Perform the one-time ability if landing on space 3, 4, or 5.  
  - **Evidence Token**: Place on Evidence Board in matching color space.  
    - **Editor**: Place **face-up**  
    - **Nixon**: Place **face-down**  
    - If token has **red momentum icon**, move Momentum Token 1 space toward you.  

After playing for value, discard card.

##### Playing a Card for Action  
Follow the text on the card.  
- **Event Cards**: Removed from the game after use.  
- **Conspirator (Nixon) / Journalist (Editor)**: Go to discard pile after use.  
- **Reaction Cards**: May only be played **in response** to specific opponent actions (e.g., after a conspirator is played).  

Fully resolve all instructions. Players may **choose not to use** a card’s action.

#### C. Evaluation Phase  
After all cards are played, follow these steps in order:  

1. **Return Evidence at 0**:  
   - All evidence tokens on space 0 (face-up or face-down) return to the bag.  

2. **Resolve Initiative Token**:  
   - If on a player’s side (1–5), that player takes it, places it on their Initiative Card, and points the arrow toward themselves.  
   - If on **0**, the player who **did NOT have initiative this round** takes it.  

3. **Resolve Momentum Token**:  
   - If on a player’s side, they take it and place it on the **lowest empty space** of their Momentum Card.  
     - **If Nixon places the 5th token → Nixon wins immediately.**  
   - If on **0**, return to supply.  
   - **If no tokens left in supply when one is needed → Nixon wins immediately.**  

4. **Reset Tokens**:  
   - Place Initiative Token back on **0**.  
   - Place **a new Momentum Token** from supply onto **0**.  
     - If no tokens in supply → **Nixon wins immediately.**  

5. **Award Evidence Tokens**:  
   - Starting with the player who **now has initiative** (arrow points to them):  
     - Each player takes all evidence tokens on **their side** of the track (1–5).  
     - Place each on the Evidence Board in an empty space matching **at least one color** on the token.  
       - **Editor**: Place **face-up**  
       - **Nixon**: Place **face-down**  
       - If token has **red momentum icon**, move Momentum Token 1 space toward that player.  

6. **Check Victory Conditions**  
   - **Editor wins** if two informants are connected to Nixon via **adjacent face-up evidence tokens**.  
   - **Nixon wins** if he has 5 tokens on his Momentum Card or no momentum tokens remain in supply.  

If no winner, begin next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Token Movement  
- Only one token moved per card played for value.  
- Movement is along the Research Track toward the player’s side (toward 5).  
- Tokens can pass through or land on 0.  

#### Evidence Tokens  
- Start face-down when drawn by Nixon.  
- Flip face-up **when moved by either player**.  
- May have **multiple colors** → can be placed in any matching color area.  
- May have **red momentum icon** → triggers +1 momentum movement when claimed.  

#### Initiative & Momentum  
- **Initiative** determines turn order and who resolves first in Evaluation.  
- **Momentum Token** cycles on/off the track; placed on player cards when claimed.  
- **Editor’s Momentum Card**: Spaces 3, 4, 5 grant one-time abilities when filled.  

#### Card Types  
| Type | Owner | Effect | After Use |  
|------|-------|--------|-----------|  
| **Event** | Both | Special effect | Removed from game |  
| **Conspirator** | Nixon | Disruptive action | Discard |  
| **Journalist** | Editor | Investigative action | Discard |  
| **Reaction** | Both | Play in response | Discard or remove |  

#### Visibility & Information  
- **Nixon** can always look at face-down evidence on track.  
- **Editor** cannot. Must ask Nixon about colors to move face-down tokens.  
- Both players may inspect **each other’s discard piles** and **removed cards**.  

#### Deck Management  
- When deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
- If no cards to draw, draw 0.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Immediate Wins**:  
- **Nixon Wins If**:  
  - Places the **5th momentum token** on his card.  
  - A momentum token is required (e.g., in Evaluation Phase) but **none remain in supply**.  

- **Editor Wins If**:  
  - **Two informants** are connected to Nixon via an **unbroken chain** of **adjacent face-up evidence tokens** on the Evidence Board.  

Game ends **immediately** when a win condition is met. No further actions.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I move a token beyond space 5?**  
A: No. Maximum is space 5. Movement stops there.  

**Q: What if the Momentum Token is on 5 and an evidence token with a red icon is claimed?**  
A: No effect. The momentum token is already off the track. Bonus is lost.  

**Q: Can I use a reaction card at any time?**  
A: Only **immediately after** the triggering event (e.g., right after Nixon plays a conspirator).  

**Q: What happens if both players run out of cards mid-round?**  
A. The Card Phase ends. Proceed to Evaluation.  

**Q: Can Nixon lie about face-down token colors?**  
A: No. Nixon must answer truthfully when asked by Editor.  

**Q: Can I discard a card without using it?**  
A: Yes. If you cannot or choose not to use value or action, you may discard it.  

**Q: What if the Initiative Token is on 0 and the current initiative holder loses it?**  
A: The **other player** gains it (player who did not have initiative this round).  

**Q: Can I move an evidence token that’s already on my side?**  
A: Yes, as long as it’s not yet claimed (i.e., not at 5 and not taken in Evaluation).
