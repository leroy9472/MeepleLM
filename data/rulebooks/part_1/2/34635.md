## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In Stone Age, players lead a tribe of primitive people during the dawn of civilization. The goal is to develop a thriving society by efficiently using workers (tribe members) to gather resources, build huts, and acquire civilization cards. Victory is achieved by earning the most victory points (VPs) through building structures, purchasing civilization cards, and end-game scoring multipliers.

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board  
- 4 player boards  
- 58 wooden resources (wood, brick, stone, gold)  
- 40 wooden people (workers)  
- 8 wooden markers (2 per player: 1 for food track, 1 for scoring track)  
- 53 food tiles  
- 28 building tiles (4 stacks of 7)  
- 18 tool tiles  
- 1 start player figure ("Chief")  
- 36 civilization cards  
- 7 dice  
- 1 leather dice cup  
- 1 information sheet (scoring reference)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
   - 1 player board  
   - 5 workers (placed on player board)  
   - 12 food  
   - 1 marker on space 0 of the food track (lower left)  
   - 1 marker on space 0 of the scoring track (upper left)  
3. Remaining workers, tools, and resources placed in general supply.  
4. Shuffle building tiles into 4 face-down stacks of 7.  
   - 4 players: use all 4 stacks  
   - 3 players: use 3 stacks  
   - 2 players: use 2 stacks  
   Reveal top tile of each stack.  
5. Shuffle civilization cards and place face-down as draw pile. Draw top 4 cards and place on board from right to left.  
6. Place food tiles in stacks by value on the hunting grounds.  
7. Choose starting player and give them the start player figure.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:

#### 1. Place Workers  
- Starting with the start player, players take turns placing **1 or more** of their workers on available action spaces.  
- Each player must place at least one worker if possible. Passing is not allowed.  
- Once a player places workers in an area, they **cannot place more** there later in the same round.  
- Play proceeds clockwise until all workers are placed or no legal placements remain.

#### 2. Resolve Workers  
- Starting with the start player, each player resolves **all** their placed workers in any order.  
- Workers are returned to the player board after use.

##### Action Spaces & Effects:
- **Hunt (Unlimited workers)**  
  Roll 1 die per worker. Total pips. For every full **2**, gain 1 food.

- **Forest (Up to 7 total workers)**  
  Roll 1 die per worker. For every full **3**, gain 1 wood.

- **Clay Pit (Up to 7 total workers)**  
  Roll 1 die per worker. For every full **4**, gain 1 brick.

- **Quarry (Up to 7 total workers)**  
  Roll 1 die per worker. For every full **5**, gain 1 stone.

- **River (Up to 7 total workers)**  
  Roll 1 die per worker. For every full **6**, gain 1 gold.

- **Field (1 worker max)**  
  Move food production marker up 1 space on food track.

- **Hut (2 workers required)**  
  Take 1 additional worker from supply (available in all future rounds).

- **Tool Maker (1 worker max)**  
  Take 1 tool tile:  
  - First 3 tools: value 1  
  - Tools 4–6: flip 1s to 2s  
  - Tools 7–9: replace 2s with 3s  
  - Tools 10–12: flip 3s to 4s  
  Tools can be used once per round to boost die rolls (full value only).

- **Buildings (1 worker per building)**  
  Pay resources shown on tile. Gain tile and immediately score VPs indicated.  
  Types:  
  - Fixed cost (e.g., 2 wood, 1 brick)  
  - Flexible: pay **exactly 4 resources from exactly 2 types**  
  - Flexible: pay **1–7 resources of any types** → score sum of resource values (wood=3, brick=4, stone=5, gold=6)

- **Civilization Cards (1 worker per card)**  
  Pay 1–4 building resources (any combination, not food). Take card.  
  - **Top (Immediate Effect):** Apply immediately  
  - **Bottom (End Game):** Score during final scoring  
  After purchase, slide remaining cards right and refill from deck left to right.

#### 3. Feed Tribe  
- Each worker requires **1 food**.  
- First, gain food equal to your food production level.  
- Then pay 1 food per worker.  
- If insufficient food:  
  1. Return all food to supply.  
  2. Pay deficit using **any resources** (1:1).  
  3. If still short, lose **10 VP**.

#### New Round Preparation  
- Start player token passes to the left.  
- Slide remaining civilization cards right to fill gaps.  
- Refill empty card spaces from draw pile (right to left).  
- Flip used tools back to unused position.  
- Begin next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Worker Placement:** Turn-based placement with competition for limited spaces.  
- **Resource Gathering:** Dice-based with division mechanics. Tools can boost rolls.  
- **Tools:** Upgradable (1→2→3→4). Each can be used once per round in full. Rotated 90° when used.  
- **Flexible Building Costs:** Some buildings allow choice of resources and/or number.  
- **Civilization Cards:** Provide immediate benefits and end-game scoring multipliers.  
- **Starvation Rule:** Players may lose 10 VP if unable to feed workers even after spending resources.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### End Game Triggers (Check at Start of New Round)  
- **If civilization cards cannot refill the 4-card display** → game ends immediately.  
- **If any building stack is empty** → complete the current round, then end.

#### Final Scoring  
1. **Civilization Cards (Bottom Section):**  
   - **Green Background (Culture):**  
     - Group cards by symbol set (2 sets of 8 symbols).  
     - For each set: **number of different symbols × itself**  
     - Example: 5 unique in one set = 25 points  
     - Duplicate symbols form additional sets  
   - **Sand Background (Leaders):**  
     - **Farmers:** × your food production level  
     - **Tool Makers:** × total tool value (e.g., 3 tools: 1+2+3 = 6)  
     - **Hut Builders:** × number of buildings owned  
     - **Shamans:** × number of workers (including those on board)  

2. **Leftover Resources:**  
   - Each **wood, brick, stone, gold** = 1 VP  
   - Food does **not** score

3. **Add all points** to current score on track.

#### Tiebreaker  
Player with highest combined total of:  
- Food production level  
- Number of tools  
- Number of workers  
wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

  Game still ends at end of current round.
