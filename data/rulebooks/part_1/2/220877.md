# Rajas of the Ganges - Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Players take on the roles of Rajas and Ranis during the Mogul Empire under Akbar the Great (1556–1605), competing to build the most prosperous and prestigious provinces. The objective is to strategically develop your province, manage resources, and balance fame and wealth. The game ends when a player's fame and money markers converge or cross. The winner is the player with the greatest positive difference between their fame and money markers. In case of a tie, the player whose markers crossed first wins.

## 2. Components
- 1 double-sided game board (2-player / 3–4 player)
- 4 province boards (standard and Navaratnas sides)
- 4 Kali statue boards (10-dice and 8-dice sides)
- 24 workers (6 per color)
- 4 boats
- 4 fame markers
- 4 money markers
- 4 bonus markers
- 20 cubes (5 per color: 4 upgrade, 1 karma)
- 48 dice (12 per color: orange, green, blue, purple)
- 64 province tiles (16 per color, sorted by snake, cow, tiger backs)
- 30 yield tiles (8 white, 9 yellow, 6 red, 7 brown)
- 8 river tiles
- 2 cover tiles (for 3-player game)
- 1 starting player elephant

## 3. Setup
1. Place the game board with the appropriate side up (2-player or 3–4 player). For 3 players, use cover tiles to block specific quarry and harbor spaces.
2. Sort province tiles into 12 stacks: group by color, then by animal back (snake, cow, tiger). Shuffle each stack and place face-up next to the board.
3. Shuffle the 8 white yield tiles and place face-down on the temple.
4. Each player receives:
   - 1 province board (standard side up for base game)
   - 1 Kali statue board (10-dice side for base game)
   - 6 workers
   - 1 boat
   - 5 cubes (1 karma, 4 building upgrades)
   - 1 fame marker
   - 1 money marker
   - 1 bonus marker
5. Place 3 workers on the fame track (15), money track (20), and river bridge. Place remaining 3 below Kali statue.
6. Place boat on river start space. Place karma cube on level 1. Place one upgrade cube on value 2 of each building scroll. Place fame marker on space 0. Place bonus marker on money track space 12 (river side up).
7. Each player rolls one die of each color. The player with the lowest total becomes starting player, takes the elephant, and places their money marker on space 3. Others place markers clockwise: 4, 5, 6.
8. Players place their rolled dice on Kali statue.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
- Rounds proceed in clockwise order starting with the current starting player.
- On a player's turn:
  1. Place one worker on an unoccupied action space.
  2. Pay any required costs (money and/or dice).
  3. Carry out the action.
- Players continue taking turns until all have placed all workers.
- At round end:
  - If a player used the Great Mogul (Chamber 1), they become the next starting player.
  - Otherwise, starting player passes clockwise.
  - All players retrieve their workers.
- A new round begins.
