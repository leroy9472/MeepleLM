### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds over four seasons. Each season has three phases: **Start of Season**, **Worker Placement**, and **End of Season**.

#### Start of Season  
- **Spring**: Player with lowest Home tile starts.  
- **Summer/Autumn/Winter**: Start player is the winner of the Turn Order tile with the purple Start Player icon from the previous season.  
- **Boat Tiles**: Flip to current season side.  
- **Summer/Autumn Only**:  
  - Add new workers and skill tiles to boats as indicated.  
  - Place new season’s village tiles (per player count), season icon face up.  
    - Summer Boat tiles: Side chosen randomly; cannot be upgraded.  
- **Winter Only**:  
  - Players simultaneously select 1+ of their Winter tiles, place face down in center.  
  - Shuffle and reveal for auction. Unused tiles discarded.

#### Worker Placement  
- Play proceeds clockwise from the start player.  
- On a turn, a player may:  
  1. **Bid** on a Village or Turn Order tile.  
  2. **Use** a tile (in own village, another player’s village, or current season tiles).  
  3. **Pass**.  
- A passed player may act again if not all players have passed.  
- Season ends when all players pass consecutively.

#### Bidding  
- **Placement**: Place 1+ workers of the same color on your side of a tile.  
- **Color Matching**: Workers must match the color of any existing bid or usage on the tile.  
- **Bid Amount**: Must exceed the previous bid. No maximum.  
- **Outbid Workers**: Can be moved (as a group) to another bid, production, or exchange. Can be supplemented with other losing bids or workers from behind screen. Cannot return to screen.  
- **Turn Order Tiles**:  
  - Not added to village (except in winter).  
  - Determine boat selection order and next season’s start player.  
  - A player may win multiple tiles but only takes rewards from one boat (spring/summer/autumn) or takes one boat + all won tiles (winter).

#### Production  
- **Activation**: Place workers on a tile to gain its benefit.  
- **First Use**: Usually 1 worker.  
- **Reuse**:  
  - Second use: 2 workers of same color as previous.  
  - Third use: 3 workers of same color.  
- **Maximum**: 6 workers total per tile per season.  
- **Color Rule**: Workers must match color of any existing bid or usage.  
- **Benefits**:  
  - **Own Village**: Resources placed on generating tile.  
  - **Other Villages/Center Tiles**: Resources placed on player’s Home tile.  
  - **Skills/Workers**: Placed behind player’s screen.  
- **Overbidding**: Players may use more workers than required to block reuse.

#### Transport & Upgrading  
- **Activation**: Place 1+ workers on a **Transport Tile** (Home, Farrier, Stable, Wainwright).  
- **Transport**:  
  - Move resources along roads.  
  - Movement points (cart icon) can be split among resources.  
- **Upgrade**:  
  - Upgrade one tile per house icon.  
  - **Cost**: Resources (on tile) and skill tokens (from behind screen).  
  - **Flip**: Tile orientation preserved. Unused resources/workers remain.  
- **Tiles Eligible**: All except Winter and Summer Boat tiles.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Worker Color**: Dictates who can bid or use a tile after initial placement.  
- **Resource Limits**: Gold is a wild resource. Supplies are finite.  
- **Worker Exchange**: Outbid groups can be moved but not split.  
- **Simultaneous Tile Placement**: At season end, players add tiles to their village simultaneously.  
- **Tile Matching**: Adjacent tile edges (road, no road, water) must match. Boat tiles do not require water-to-water connection.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after Winter.  
- **Scoring Steps**:  
  1. **Autumn Scoring Tiles**:  
     - Barn, Blacksmith, Stone Yard, Timber Yard score points for resources on them (gold can substitute).  
     - Resources used here cannot be scored elsewhere.  
  2. **Allocate Remaining Items**:  
     - Resources, skills, workers allocated to Winter tiles, boats, etc.  
     - Each item scored only once.  
  3. **Purple Start Player Marker**: Can be used as any resource, skill, or worker.  
  4. **Fixed VP Tiles**: Score points shown in top-right corner (e.g., Keythedral: 12 VP).  
  5. **Turn Order Tiles (Winter)**: 1 VP per adjacent tile.  
  6. **Boat Tiles**: Score as per individual ability.  
  7. **Unused Gold**: 1 VP each.  
- **Win Condition**: Highest score wins. Ties result in a rematch.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Insufficient Workers**: If bag is empty when placing on boats, place 1 worker per boat in turn until supply exhausted.  
- **No Start Player Bid**: If no one bids for the Start Player tile, the current start player chooses first, then the marker passes left.  
- **Green Workers**: Taken from supply, not bag. Cannot be used as wild colors.  
- **Bag Checking**: Players may feel the bag to count remaining workers.  
- **Winter Turn Order**: Winning multiple tiles grants all tiles but only one boat.  
- **Tile Orientation**: When upgrading, flip tile but keep original orientation.
