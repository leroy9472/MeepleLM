## 5. Core Mechanics
### Main Actions (must do 1 per turn)
- **Take 5 Coins**: Place 1 die → gain 5 coins
- **Grand Bazaar (Marketplace)**: Place dice → take goods/camels based on lowest die value
- **Favor of Khan**: Place 1 die ≥ left neighbor → gain 1 good + 2 camels. Max 4 dice total.
- **Obtain Contracts**: Place 1 die → take 1–2 contracts ≤ die value. Bonus: space 5 (1 coin/camel), space 6 (2 coins/camels)
- **Travel**: Place 2 dice → move up to value of lower die. Pay coin cost per step + route costs (camels/coins). Must move ≥1 step.
- **Large City Card Actions**: Requires trading post in city. Use action once per round. Die value = max uses.

### Action Space Rules
- **Brown spaces** (City Cards, Khan’s Favor): Can only be used once per round by one player
- **Blue spaces** (Bazaar, Contracts, 5 Coins): Can be used by multiple players, but only once per color per round
- **Occupied spaces**: If using blue space with opponent’s die, pay coins = value of your lowest die
- **Black/white dice**: Not tied to color; can be used multiple times per round, even on same space

### Additional Actions (optional, any number)
1. **Complete 1 Contract**: Pay goods/camels → gain reward → flip contract face down
2. **Take 3 Coins**: Place 1 die on Coin Bag → gain 3 coins (no cost even if occupied)
3. **Re-roll 1 Die**: Pay 1 camel → re-roll 1 die (including black/white)
4. **Adjust Die ±1**: Pay 2 camels → change 1 die by 1 (1↔6 not allowed)
5. **Take 1 Black Die**: Pay 3 camels → take, roll, and use 1 black die (once per turn)
