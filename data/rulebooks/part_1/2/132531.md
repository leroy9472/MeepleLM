## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Roll for the Galaxy is a dice-driven strategy game of space empire building. Players take on the role of competing galactic civilizations, aiming to develop worlds, technologies, and economies to earn Victory Points (VPs). The goal is to be the first to trigger the endgame and have the highest score through constructed tiles, VPs, and tiebreakers.

### 2. Components  
- Player mats  
- Dice (white, colored, specialty)  
- VP chips (12 per player, plus 10 for endgame scoring)  
- Faction tiles  
- Home world tiles  
- Development and World tiles  
- Construction zones  
- Credit markers  
- Phase strip (Explore, Develop, Settle, Produce, Ship)  
- Rulebook and reference sheets  

### 3. Setup  
- Each player receives:  
  - 12 VP chips  
  - $1 credit  
  - 5 white dice (3 in cup, 2 in citizenry)  
  - 1 faction tile and 1 home world tile  
- Place dice according to starting tile abilities  
- Draw 2 tiles: 1 Development and 1 World, place in construction zone  
- Set credit marker to $1  
- Place VP chips in supply (10 extra for endgame scoring)

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in 5 phases:

1. **Roll**  
   - Roll all dice behind screen. Dice may show: Explore, Develop, Settle, Produce, Ship, or Wild.

2. **Assign**  
   - Place dice under phase columns matching their face.  
   - Choose one die to move to a phase strip action square—this activates the phase.  
   - Optional: Use **Dictate**—spend one die (place in cup) to reassign another die to a different phase.  
   - All dice now act as workers for their assigned phase, regardless of face.

3. **Reveal**  
   - Reveal assigned phases.  
   - Non-activated dice return to cup.  
   - In 2-player: Roll a white die to possibly activate an additional phase.  
   - Simultaneously execute all selected phases.

4. **Do Phases** (in order: Explore, Develop, Settle, Produce, Ship)  
   - **Explore**:  
     a) *Scout*: Abandon any existing tiles, draw (abandoned + 1) tiles, choose Dev/World, add to bottom of stacks. Abandoned tiles go under Explore tile, later returned to bag.  
     b) *Stock*: Gain $2.  
   - **Develop**:  
     - Place dice on Development stack.  
     - Develop topmost Development(s) if dice total ≥ cost.  
     - Surplus dice return to cup.  
   - **Settle**:  
     - Place dice on World stack.  
     - Settle topmost World(s) if dice total ≥ cost.  
     - Surplus dice return to cup.  
   - **Produce**:  
     - Add one good (die) per non-grey world. Max 1 good per world.  
     - Die becomes the good and is placed on the world.  
   - **Ship**:  
     a) *Trade*: Sell good for $ based on **world color**, not good color.  
     b) *Consume*: Gain 1 VP + 1 VP if good color matches world + 1 VP if shipper color matches.  
     - Purple (Consumption) die matches all colors for VP bonuses.

5. **Manage Empire**  
   - **Recruit**: Spend $1 per die to move dice from citizenry to cup. Must recruit as many as affordable. If $0 after, gain $1.  
   - **Recall**: Freely return dice from construction zones or goods from worlds to cup.  
   - **Check Game End**: Triggered if:  
     - VP chips are exhausted, OR  
     - Any player has 12 or more tile spaces (home world counts as 2).

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Dice as Workers**: Dice represent workers assigned to phases. Once assigned, face value no longer matters.  
- **Dictate Action**: Spend one die to reassign another die to a different phase. The spent die goes to cup.  
- **Construction Zones**: Stacks of face-down tiles. Only top tile is visible (number known, content secret).  
- **Abandoning Tiles**: During Explore, tiles may be secretly abandoned and returned to bag later.  
- **Timing**: If turn order matters, use faction number (lowest first).  
- **Purple Die**: Acts as any color during Ship phase for matching bonuses.  
- **Money Cap**: Credits above $10 are lost.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends when:  
- VP chips are gone, OR  
- A player reaches 12 tile spaces.

**Scoring**:  
- VP chips held  
- Cost of all built Worlds and Developments  
- Bonus: Round up cost of each 6+ cost Development (e.g., 6-cost = 3 VP, 7-cost = 4 VP)  

**Tiebreakers**:  
1. Dice in cup (more wins)  
2. Credits (more wins)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Empty Stacks in Develop/Settle**: Any dice remaining on empty stack at end of phase return to cup.  
- **Using Powers**: Tile powers can be used in the phase they are built.  
- **Wild Die**: During Assign, Wild allows choice of phase. During Reveal (Bot rules), only selected phase is executed.  
- **Good Production**: Producer die becomes the good; placed on world. Only one good per world.  
- **Trade Value**: Based on **world color**, not good color.  
- **Consumption Bonuses**:  
  - 1 VP base  
  - +1 if good color matches world  
  - +1 if shipper (die used in Ship phase) color matches world  
  - Purple die counts as matching any world color.  
- **Recall at Endgame**: Recall all dice and goods to cup—dice and money are tiebreakers.  
- **Construction Zone Secrecy**: Number of tiles in stack is public; contents are secret. Abandoned tiles are secret.  
- **Phase Activation**: Only activated phases are executed. One phase must be selected per turn.
