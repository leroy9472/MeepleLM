**Event Phase:**
1. Launch CSS: Reveal CSS token under Time token and resolve.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Movement:**
- Basic Movement: Pay 1 Action card to move to adjacent room. Reveal exploration token if unexplored. Perform Noise roll if room is empty.
- Careful Movement: Pay 2 Action cards to move. Instead of Noise roll, place Noise marker in chosen corridor. Cannot move if all connecting corridors have Noise markers.
- Escape: While in combat, pay 1 Action card to move to adjacent room. Before moving, resolve Intruder Attack for each Intruder in room.

**Noise & Encounters:**
- Noise Roll: Roll Noise die. 1-4: Place Noise marker in corresponding corridor. Silence: Nothing. Danger: Move all non-combat Intruders from neighboring rooms to this room; if none, place Noise markers in all connecting corridors.
- Encounter: Triggered when placing second Noise marker in a corridor. Discard Noise markers from all connecting corridors, draw Intruder token, place corresponding Intruder, compare token number to player's hand size (lower in Power, higher in Darkness). If hand size < token number, Surprise Attack occurs.

**Combat:**
- Shoot: Pay 1 Action card. Discard 1 Ammo. Roll Combat die (no Power) or Advantage die (Power). Hits deal 1 Injury.
- Melee Attack: Pay 1 Action card. Draw 1 Contamination card. Roll Combat die. Hits deal 1 Injury; misses cause 1 Serious Wound.
- Intruder Attack: Target character with fewest Action cards (tiebreaker: First Player order). Draw Intruder Attack card. If symbol matches, resolve effect; otherwise, miss.

**Intruder Injuries & Death:**
- Larva/Egg: 1 Injury kills.
- Creeper/Adult: Draw 1 Intruder Attack card. If Blood number ≤ Injury markers, killed.
- Breeder/Queen: Draw 2 Intruder Attack cards. If sum of Blood numbers ≤ Injury markers, killed.
- Retreat: If any drawn card has Retreat arrow, Intruder retreats (draw Event card to move).

**Items & Crafting:**
- Heavy Items: Must be placed in hand slots (max 2). Cannot be used on other Characters unless specified.
- Crafting: Discard 2 Item cards with blue Component symbols to gain Crafted Item with matching gray symbols.
- Repository: Characters in this room may craft using 1 fewer Item card. All players in room may craft for free using 1 Item.

**Power:**
- Powered Section: Power token blue side up. Benefits: Use Advantage die when shooting, use Computer Actions, not in Darkness, Noise markers removed in Event Phase.
- Restoring Power: Use Backup Power Supply room to Reset (flip tokens 1-2 blue, 3-4 red) or Rearrange tokens.

**Knowledge & Weaknesses:**
- Gain Knowledge: Analyze Object (3), Use Computer Action (1), Discover Nest (1), Use Archive (2).
- Discover Weakness: Research Object in Laboratory. Only Characters with sufficient Knowledge can exploit Weaknesses.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
