### 1. Lore & Objective
It is the beginning of the Meiji era in Japan. Yokohama, once a sleepy fishing village, has become the premier trading hub due to reopened foreign trade. Players act as merchants competing to gain fame through successful business ventures, including collecting trade goods, learning foreign technology, and developing the city by building shops and trading houses. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VP) through various achievements and end-game scoring.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds, with each player taking a turn in clockwise order. A turn consists of three phases:
1. **A) Additional Action Phase (First Half)**
2. **B) Main Action Phase**
3. **C) Additional Action Phase (Second Half)**

The game ends when an end-game condition is triggered. The current round is completed, followed by one final full round.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**A) Additional Action Phase (First and Second Half)**
Players may perform the following actions in any order and as many times as possible, with the exception of using a Foreign Agent (once per turn):
- **Use a Foreign Agent:** Turn a Foreign Agent token face-down. Choose an Area with at least one of your Assistants but not your President. You may choose an Area with an opposing President without paying. Then, carry out the Main Action Phase steps 3-6 (Area Action, 5-Power Bonus, Construction, Recovery) in that Area.
- **Fulfill an Achievement:** If you meet the requirements of a face-up Achievement Card, place an Assistant from your hand on it. The first player to do so gains the higher VP bonus; subsequent players gain the lower bonus. You may fulfill all three types (A, B, C) once each.
- **Fulfill an Order:** Reveal an Order Card from your hand, discard the required goods, and gain the listed rewards.

**B) Main Action Phase**
1. **Placement Step:** Choose one option:
   - Place 1 Assistant from your hand into each of up to 3 different Areas.
   - Place 2 Assistants from your hand into a single Area.
   - **Rules:**
     - Assistants must come from your hand.
     - Cannot place in the Canal.
     - Can place in the Area with your President.
     - For each opposing President in an Area, pay that player 1 Yen per Assistant you place.
2. **Movement Step:** Choose one option:
   - **Return to Hand:** Return your President and any number of your Assistants (from any Area) to your hand. Skip steps 3-6.
   - **Move from Hand:** Place your President into any Area that contains at least one of your Assistants and no opposing President.
   - **Move from an Area:** Move your President through adjacent Areas to a legal destination (an Area with at least one of your Assistants and no opposing President). Each Area you move through must have at least one of your Assistants (shops/houses don't count). Pay 1 Yen to each player with a President in an Area you move through. Cannot return to the starting Area.
3. **Area Action Step:**
   - Calculate your Power in the Area where your President ends its movement. Each of the following contributes 1 Power: your President, Assistant, Shop, Trading House, and the Station token (if placed there). Maximum Power is 5.
   - Carry out the Area's action based on your Power level.
   - Any opponent with a Trading House in the Area receives 1 Yen from the bank.
4. **5-Power Bonus (Optional):** If you performed a 5-Power action, take the 5-Power token from that Area (if available), gain its bonus, and place it face-down in front of you.
5. **Construction (Optional):** If you performed a 4- or 5-Power action, you may build:
   - **Shop:** Only 1 per player per Area. Place from hand to an empty Shop space on the Building Site Card and gain the reward.
   - **Trading House:** Only 1 per Area total. Place from hand to the empty Trading House space and gain the reward.
6. **Recovery Step:** Return all of your Assistants from the Area where you performed the action to your hand.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End Game Trigger:**
The game ends at the end of a round when any of the following occur:
- Any player builds all 4 of their Trading Houses.
- Any player builds all 8 of their Shops.
- There are not enough Order Cards to refill the Port and Docks Boards.
- The number of Assistants on the Church Management Board reaches: 2/3 players: 5, 4 players: 6 (in a 2-player game, the dummy player's Assistant counts).
- The number of Assistants on the Customs Management Board reaches: 2/3 players: 5, 4 players: 6 (in a 2-player game, the dummy player's Assistant counts).

After the trigger, complete the current round, then play one final full round.

**Final Score Calculation (in order):**
1. **Church Bonus:**
   - Most Assistants: 6 VP
   - Second Most: 3 VP
   - Tiebreaker: Player with the rightmost Assistant on the board.
2. **Customs Bonus:**
   - Most Assistants: 8 VP
   - Second Most: 4 VP
   - Tiebreaker: Player with the rightmost Assistant on the board.
3. **Technology Bonus:**
   - Most total Industry Value on Technology Cards: 10 VP
   - Second Most: 5 VP
   - Tiebreaker: Player earliest in turn order.
   - (In a 2-player game, a dummy player has 7.5 Industry Value).
4. **Country Bonus:** Group country icons from completed Orders and Technology Cards into sets of different countries.
   - 5 different icons: 12 VP
   - 4 different icons: 8 VP
   - 3 different icons: 4 VP
   - 2 different icons: 2 VP
   - 1 different icon: 0 VP
5. **Remainder Scoring:**
   - Unused Foreign Agents: 1 VP each
   - Imports: 1 VP each
   - Every 2 Yen: 1 VP
   - Every 3 Trade Goods: 1 VP

The player with the most VP wins. In a tie, the player closest to the Start Player (clockwise) wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hand Limit:** You may have a maximum of 3 Order Cards in hand. You cannot discard them to make room for new ones.
- **Dummy Player (2-player):** The blocked Assistant on the Church and Customs boards is a "dummy player" used for scoring ties and end-game triggers.
- **Foreign Agent Use:** Can only be used once per turn, but can be used in either the first or second Additional Action Phase.
- **5-Power Token:** Only the first player to perform a 5-Power action in an Area can claim its token.
- **Ties:** All ties (Church, Customs, Technology) have specific, non-random breakers (rightmost Assistant or turn order).
