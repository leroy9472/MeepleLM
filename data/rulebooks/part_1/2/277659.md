### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds through five phases:  
1. **Action Phase** – Player uses Action cards to move, search, attack, heal, etc.  
2. **Planning Phase** – Spend leftover Time to buy new Action cards.  
3. **Killer Phase** – Resolve Terror card or Finale; Killer moves and attacks.  
4. **Panic Phase** – Victims flee if any were killed this turn.  
5. **Upkeep Phase** – Check for Finale, perform upkeep, rearrange inventory.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action Phase  
- Play Action cards one at a time.  
- Roll Horror dice: number = Horror track level, minimum of 1 die.  
- Success: Roll ≥3 or discard 2 cards to convert failure to success.  
- Actions may modify Time; if Time drops below 0, Action Phase ends immediately.  
- You may discard any number of Action cards **before** the phase ends to gain +1 Time per card.  
- Movement: You may take up to 2 Victims with you when leaving a space; Victims never follow into Killer’s space.  
- Saving Victims: In any space with an Exit symbol and Victims, you may save them (even mid-movement). Place saved Victims on your character card.  
- Searching: Gain top Item from a stack. Items have hand requirements (0, 1, or 2 hands). Track limited-use items with tokens.  
- Healing: Cannot exceed starting health.  
- Attacking: Add attack value from Action card + weapon damage (if held in hand). Range restrictions apply. Dual-wielding: choose one weapon.  
- Reaction Cards: May be played **in reaction** to an attack. Each Reaction card defends against one attack. Cannot protect Victims or defend against “loss of health” icons (e.g., from 𝟘).  

#### Planning Phase  
- Spend unspent Time to purchase Action cards (cost shown on card).  
- 0-cost cards are free.  
- Cannot purchase cards if Time would drop below 0.  
- Cards played or discarded this turn are **not available** until next Planning Phase.  
- Hand limit: 10 cards. Cannot voluntarily discard outside Action Phase.  
- After purchasing: Reset Time to 6. Return played/discarded cards to shop.  

#### Killer Phase  
- **Finale Check:** If no Terror cards remain, reveal Finale card.  
- **Draw Terror Card** (unless Finale is active).  
- **Killer Movement & Attack:**  
  - Targets Victims over Final Girl if both present.  
  - Ties broken by most Victims in space.  
  - Moves shortest path; attacks number of times = knife icons at current Bloodlust level.  
  - Each attack deals damage = value in knife column.  
  - Victims have 1 health; excess damage lost.  
  - Each Victim killed increases Bloodlust by 1.  
  - If Bloodlust reaches Dark Power row, reveal Dark Power.  
  - If Bloodlust maxes, trigger top effect each additional increase.  
- **Minions (if applicable):**  
  - Act before Killer.  
  - “Enemies” rules apply to both Killer and Minions.  
  - Victims may follow you into Minion spaces (unless Killer also present).  
  - When attacking, hit all Minions in space; divide damage. Cannot split between Minions and Killer.  

#### Panic Phase  
Triggered if:  
- At least one Victim was killed this turn, OR  
- A card forces panic.  
- Roll a die for each Victim in Killer’s (or Minion’s) space. Move to adjacent space based on roll (per board directions). If no valid direction, remain in place.  

#### Upkeep Phase  
1. **Finale Check:** If Terror deck is empty, reveal Finale card. No further Terror draws.  
2. **Upkeep:** Resolve ongoing effects (Items, Events, etc.).  
3. **Inventory Rearrangement:** May freely move items between hands and backpack. Only allowed during this phase or when gaining a new Item.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when:  
- **Win:** You kill the Killer.  
- **Loss:** You die (Final Girl loses last health).  
- **Win (Special):** Killer and Final Girl die simultaneously.  

#### Final Health Tokens  
- Damage removes normal health first.  
- When last health token is hit:  
  - Flip black Final Health token:  
    - Blank = Dead.  
    - Numbered = Revive with that HP. Replace with white token and add health.  
- After revival: End current phase, continue next phase.  
- Second death (white token): Truly dead. No revival.  
- No excess damage carries over after revival.  

#### Adrenaline Rush  
- If Final Girl **or** Killer is on final health (black or white): +1 die to all Horror rolls.  
- If **both** are on final health: +2 dice.  
- Bonus lost individually when character regains normal health.  

#### Dark Powers  
- Minor Dark Powers provide temporary health to Killer.  
- Damage must remove Minor Dark Power health first.  
- Once depleted, discard the card.  

#### Events  
- Ongoing: Effects persist even after drawing new Event cards.  
- One-time effects: Discard after resolution.  
- Unresolvable effects: Ignore; do not draw replacement.  

#### Special Variants  
- **The Mummy:**  
  - Has Minor and Major Curses instead of Dark Powers/Finale.  
  - Minor Curses activate via Bloodlust or Terror; reveal effect.  
  - Use Translate action to draw linked Papyrus and learn how to break curse.  
  - Breaking a curse removes both Curse and Papyrus.  
  - Major Curse revealed when Finale would be. All active Minor Curses removed; take 2 damage per curse (no defense).  
  - Must break Major Curse before Mummy can lose final health.  
  - Relics: Found during search on relic space; needed to break Major Curse. Only carry one.  

- **Dracula:**  
  - **Mist Form:** Dracula removed from board; place mist tokens. Only draw Mist cards. Cannot take damage.  
    - “Explore” Action cards let you remove mist tokens.  
    - If last token removed or 2 successes on single roll: place Dracula on that space.  
    - If all 5 Mist cards resolved: place Dracula on closest mist token; remove all tokens, take 1 damage per token.  
  - **Wolf Form:** All attacks deal +1 damage. Only draw Wolf cards.  
    - When damaged, Wolf takes +1 damage. If on same space as Final Girl, panics away, then turns into Dracula.  
    - If all 5 Wolf cards resolved: deal 1 damage to all on Wolf’s space and adjacent spaces; then turn into Dracula.  
  - Shuffle used Mist/Wolf cards to form new deck when form changes.
