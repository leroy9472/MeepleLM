# GlenMoore Chronicles - Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In Glen More II: Chronicles, each player leads a Scottish clan from the early medieval era to the 19th century, seeking to expand territory, wealth, and influence. Players gain Victory Points (VP) by acquiring land, resources, whisky, landmark cards, and notable persons. The clan that leaves the greatest impact on Scottish history wins. The player with the most VP at the end of the game wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most remaining resources wins; if still tied, players share the victory.

## 3. Setup
### Basic Game Setup
1. **Choose Colors & Distribute Components**  
   Each player chooses a color and receives:
   - 1 Home Territory Tile (Home Castle + Starting Village)
   - 10 Scotsmen
   - 10 Clan Markers  
   Place 1 Scotsman on your Starting Village Tile.

2. **Set Up Central Boards**  
   Place the Rondel and Clan Board in the center of the table.  
   Place general supply pools nearby: Resources, Whisky Casks, Coins, Victory Point Tokens.  
   Place Landmark Cards next to the board; initially reveal only A-Landmark Cards.

3. **Determine Initial Player Order**  
   Take 1 Scotsman from each player, shuffle them, and place them in consecutive spaces on the Rondel, starting at any space.  
   The player whose Scotsman is last (closest to the empty space) is first.  
   - First player receives 5 Coins  
   - Second receives 6  
   - Third receives 7  
   - Fourth receives 8  

   For 2 players: Place the Die in the space clockwise ahead of the leading player.  
   For 3 or 4 players: The Die is optional; place it if used.

4. **Sort Tile Stacks**  
   Sort tiles by back (S, A, B, C, D), shuffle each stack, and place face-down on marked board areas.  
   Insert "The End" Tile approximately in the middle of the D-Stack.  
   (Introductory variant: Place "The End" Tile on top of D-Stack.)

5. **Set Up the Rondel**  
   Place the 5 S-Tiles face-up clockwise from the leading player (or Die) on the Rondel.  
   Fill remaining spaces with face-up tiles from the A-Stack.  
   Leave one space empty behind the last player.  
   Final configuration: [Playing Pieces] → [Die (if used)] → [S-Tiles] → [A-Tiles] → [Empty Space]

6. **Additional Setup**  
   - For 2 or 3 players: Place 1 Coin on the leftmost space (marked "1") of each Market row.  
   - Place the David Hume Tile near the Clan Board.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
- The game proceeds over 4 rounds.
- **Rounds 1–3**: End when the last tile of stacks A, B, and C respectively is placed on the Rondel. Immediately trigger a Scoring Round.
- **Round 4**: Ends when all players have moved their Playing Piece onto or over "The End" Tile. Trigger the 4th Scoring Round and Final Scoring.
- **Turn Order**: The player whose Playing Piece is last on the Rondel takes the next turn. A player may take multiple consecutive turns if they remain last after moving.
- **The Die (Dummy Player)**: If used and in last position, roll it and move forward the number of tiles shown (not spaces), skipping over occupied spaces and Chronicle tiles. Discard the tile where it lands (except "The End" Tile). The Die does not remove Chronicle tiles.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Player Turn Sequence
1. **Advance Playing Piece**  
   Move your Scotsman to any space on the Rondel with a Tile (cannot land on Protected tiles).

2. **Take and Pay for Tile**  
   Take the tile, paying any cost shown (resources, Coins, or Scotsman).  
   - Resources can be paid from any tile in your territory.  
   - Scotsman must be paid from your Home Territory (Home Castle or Starting Village).  
   - Use the Market to buy missing resources if needed (see Market rules).  
   If you cannot pay, you cannot take the tile.

3. **Place the Tile**
   - **Landscape Tile**: Place according to placement rules.  
   - **Person Tile**: Set aside in your personal area (next to Whisky, Landmarks, etc.).  
   - **Overbuild Tile**: Place on top of a matching-type tile (same icon and river status). Covered tile’s one-time effect is retained; resources and Scotsmen move to the new tile.

4. **Placement Rules (Landscape Tiles)**
   - Must share at least one full edge with an existing tile in your territory.
   - Must be placed orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to a tile with one of your Scotsmen.
   - River tiles must extend the single river in your territory (left or right of existing river tiles).
   - Non-river tiles cannot be placed left or right of a river tile.
   - Only one river allowed per player.

5. **One-Time Placement Effects**  
   Resolve immediately after legal placement (before activation):
   - **Landmark Card**: Take the matching card and use its immediate effect.
   - **Scotsman**: Place 1 Scotsman from supply on this tile.
   - **Joker Resource**: Take 1 resource of your choice (Barley, Wood, Stone, Sheep, Cattle).
   - **Clan Marker**: Place 1 Clan Marker on the Clan Board (pay road cost; see Clan Board rules).
   - **Whisky**: Take 1 Whisky Cask and place it in your personal area.
   - **Coin**: Take 1 Coin.
   - **Victory Points**: Take the indicated VP.

6. **Activate Tiles**  
   After placement, activate the placed tile and up to 8 orthogonally or diagonally adjacent tiles, in any order. Each tile can be activated only once per turn.
   - **Gaining Resources**: Take the shown resource(s) and place on the activated tile (max 3 per tile).
   - **Exchanging Resources**: Return resources to the pool to gain VP, Whisky, or place Clan Markers.
   - **Movement Points**: Gain 1 Movement Point per activated Movement tile. Each allows 1 Scotsman to move one space (orthogonal or diagonal) within your territory. Multiple points can be split or combined.
   - **Victory Points**: Gain immediate VP as shown.
   - **Overbuild Tiles**: Activate normally; the covered tile no longer activates.

7. **Refill the Rondel**  
   Add 1 or more tiles from the current stack (A, B, C, or D) to refill spaces, leaving exactly one empty space behind the last Playing Piece.  
   - If all players have moved over a tile without taking it, it is discarded and replaced.  
   - If placing the last tile of stack A, B, or C, trigger a Scoring Round after refill.

8. **Market (Any Time During Turn)**  
   - **Buying**: Place 1, 2, or 3 Coins on the leftmost empty space of a resource row to buy that resource. Must be used immediately (to pay for tiles or activations). Cannot buy to store.
   - **Selling**: Remove a resource from your territory and take the Coins from the rightmost space of that row. Can sell only if Coins are present.
   - Whisky and Scotsmen cannot be bought or sold.

9. **Person Tiles and Clan Board**  
   When taking a Person Tile:
   - Set it aside (does not go into territory).
   - Place 1 Clan Marker on an unoccupied Clan Field on the Clan Board.
   - Pay Coin cost along the path from either:
     - The green Start Field, or
     - Any already-occupied Clan Field (regardless of owner).
   - Receive the Clan’s bonus (immediate or ongoing).
   - Each Clan Field can be claimed only once (except Douglas, which can be claimed multiple times by any player for 3 VP each time).

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### Scoring Rounds (4 Total)
- **Rounds 1–3**: Triggered when last tile of stacks A, B, C is placed.
- **Round 4**: Triggered when all players have moved onto or over "The End" Tile.

**Scoring Categories** (compare to player with fewest in each):
1. Scotsmen in Home Castle (right half of Home Tile)
2. Number of Landmark Cards
3. Number of Whisky Casks
4. Number of Person Tiles (David Hume counts as 2)

**Scoring Table**:
- +1 more than lowest: 1 VP
- +2: 2 VP
- +3: 3 VP
- +4: 5 VP
- +5: 8 VP

Players keep all components after scoring.

### Final Scoring
After the 4th Scoring Round:
1. **Territory Size Penalty**: Compare number of territory tiles (excluding Person Tiles) to the smallest territory. Lose 3 VP for each tile over the minimum.
2. **Coins**: Gain 1 VP per Coin.
3. **Landmark Cards**: Apply end-game effects (e.g., Armadale Castle doubles first 8 Coins’ value).
4. **Total VP**: Highest total wins. Tiebreaker: most remaining resources.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can’t Take Any Tile?** Discard a tile by moving onto it; gain 1 Coin or 1 Movement Point.
- **Multiple Tiles Skipped?** All skipped tiles are discarded and replaced from current stack.
- **Overbuilding Overbuild Tiles?** Allowed. Only top tile activates; components transfer up.
- **River Blocking**: Cannot place a non-river tile adjacent to the end of a river.
- **Clan Board Pathfinding**: Always calculate cost from nearest occupied Clan Field or Start.
- **Market Resource Limits**: Cannot buy if all 3 market spaces are filled; cannot sell if no Coins in row.
- **Tile Limits**: Max 3 resources per tile; excess is lost.
