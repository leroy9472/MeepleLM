5. All players roll dice simultaneously.  
   - If total < 15, receive compensation: 1 camel and/or 1 coin per missing pip.  
6. Place rolled dice on player boards.

**Player Turns (clockwise, starting with first player):**  
On your turn, you may:  
- Perform one **Main Action** (using 1 or more dice).  
- Perform any number of **Bonus Actions** (before or after main action, not during).

Main Actions (choose one):  
1. **Books**: Place die(s) on Books action space (1–3 dice, min value applies). Choose one offer (pay jade if required), take goods.  
2. **Khan’s Favor**: Place 1 die ≥ rightmost die (or any if empty). Take 4 coins, 2 camels.  
3. **Guild Seals**: Place exactly 2 dice. Lower die determines available seals. Take one seal (brown side up), receive one-time jade bonus. Can improve later.  
4. **Travel**: Choose one of three Travel action spaces (1, 2, or 3 dice).  
   - Pay 2 coins if using lowest space.  
   - Pay full travel costs (camels, coins, jade) before moving.  
   - Move up to value of lowest die or space max (whichever is lower).  
   - Must place trading post in final city (if none already present).  
   - Upper space (3 dice): may place second trading post in city passed through.  
5. **Contracts**: Place 1 die. Take 1–2 contracts from cities where you have trading posts. Gain 3 coins.  
6. **Special Cities** (Baghdad, Balkh, Hormuz): Must have trading post. Place 1 die on one of two brown spaces. Take shown reward. If you have improved matching guild seal, gain bonus (once or twice, based on die value).  
7. **City Cards**: Must have trading post in city. Place 1 die. Resolve action (number of times = die value). External city cards are available to all.

Bonus Actions (may be used multiple times, cost paid each time):  
1. Complete 1 Contract: Pay required goods/camels. Gain rewards (VPs, black die, advancement, etc.).  
2. Improve 1 Guild Seal: Pay cost (coins). Flip to red side. Gain immediate ! bonus and recurring bonus at start of each round.  
3. Money Bag: Place 1 die on money bag. Take 3 coins, 2 camels, or 1 jade.  
4. Reroll 1 Die: Pay 1 camel.  
5. Change 1 Die Result by 1: Pay 2 camels (up or down).  
6. Take 1 Black Die: Pay 3 camels. Roll it, add to your dice. Only once per turn (unless gained via contract).

End of Turn:  
- Refill empty contract spaces.  
- First Player: If you used a Travel action space ≥ any previously used in the round, take hourglass (next round’s first player). If no one travels, first player unchanged.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Dice Use**: Each player color can use each action space only once per round. Black dice are neutral and can be used multiple times.  
- **Jade**: Counts as 1 coin or 1 camel when paying costs.  
- **Trading Posts**:  
  - Place when ending Travel in a city without one.  
  - First to place in a city with Outpost Bonus takes it.  
  - Score 5 VP for 9th and 10th, 10 VP for 11th.  
- **Guild Seals**: Required to cross certain routes. Improving grants recurring bonuses.  
- **Character Abilities**: Unique powers (see individual character descriptions). Some require expansions.  
- **Contracts**: Provide VPs and rewards when completed. Can be used for movement, black dice, etc.  
- **Solo Variants**: Use AI players (Marvin or Automa) with predefined paths and decision rules.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Final Scoring (after Round 5):  
- **Improved Guild Seals on Goal Card**: Score indicated VP for each.  
- **Shields**:  
  - Move one trading post per shield type to shield track.  
  - Score VP based on total number of different shields (max 43).  
  - +1 shield icon for each improved guild seal matching goal card.  
  - Some characters/expansions grant additional +1 shields.  
- **Goods**: 1 VP per 2 goods (pepper, silk, gold, jade).  
- **Coins**: 1 VP per 10 coins.  
- **Contracts**:  
  - 8 VP for most completed (tie: all get 8).  
  - 4 VP for second most (not awarded in 2-player).  
- **Tiebreaker**: Most camels.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use black dice on brown action spaces?** Yes, but only once per round per space (black dice are not tied to player color).  
- **Can I improve a guild seal I don’t have?** No. Must own the basic seal first.  
- **Can I complete a contract without goods?** Only if using a character ability that waives payment (e.g., Vidal Badoer).  
- **Can I use a city card action if I just placed a trading post this turn?** Yes, starting next turn.  
- **Can I move past a city without placing a trading post?** Yes, but only if not ending movement there.  
- **Can I use multiple bonus actions in a row?** Yes, as long as you pay the cost each time.  
- **Do I get city bonus every round?** Yes, if you have a trading post in a city with a ! bonus.  
- **Can I use a Special City action twice?** Only with a black die, since each player color can use the space only once per round.
