### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Clank! In! Space!*, players are thieves attempting to infiltrate the spaceship of the evil Lord Eradikus, hack into the Command module, steal a valuable Artifact, and escape via an escape pod. The game is a race against time and each other, as noise ("Clank!") attracts Eradikus's attention, triggering attacks that can knock players out.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Hack two data ports in different modules to obtain a two-part Command Code.
- Use the Command Code to enter the Command module and steal an Artifact.
- Escape via an escape pod in the Cargo Bay (requires an Artifact).
- Score the most victory points from Artifacts, loot, and end-game bonuses.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Play Cards**: Play all 5 cards in hand. Generate:
   - **Skill** (blue): Acquire cards
   - **Swords** (red): Defeat enemies, avoid damage
   - **Boots** (yellow): Move
   - **Clank!**: Add cubes to Clank! area (triggers attacks)
2. **Take Actions**: Use generated resources in any order:
   - **Acquire**: Spend Skill to buy cards from Adventure Row (blue banner) or Reserve (yellow banner). Cards go to discard pile.
   - **Defeat Enemies**: Spend Swords to defeat red-bannered enemies in Adventure Row. Gain rewards. GØB-L1N can be fought multiple times.
   - **Buy from Market**: On Market space, spend 7 Credits to buy one of each item type.
   - **Move**: Spend Boots to move to adjacent spaces. Footprint paths cost 2 Boots. Enemy paths cause 1 damage per icon (avoid with Swords). Locks require Master Key. Arrows are one-way.
   - **Hyperlift/Telepad**: Move to any Hyperlift space (no cost). Telepad requires TelePass. Dizziness: cannot use Boots next turn.
   - **Hack Data Port**: On a Data Port space, place 1 of your 2 Data cubes. Gain bonus (Clank!, Credits, Healing, etc.). Second cube must be in different module. After two hacks, take Command Code and advance Boss Marker.
   - **Steal Artifact**: In Command module with Command Code, pick up one Artifact. Advance Boss Marker.
   - **Pick Up Secrets**: Take 1 face-down Secret token per space entered. Reveal and keep.
3. **End of Turn**:
   - Discard played cards.
   - Unused resources are lost.
   - Draw 5 new cards.
   - Refill Adventure Row to 6 cards.
   - If any new card has Boss Attack symbol, trigger **Boss Attack**:
     - Put all Clank! cubes into Boss Bag.
     - Draw number of cubes = Boss Marker position.
     - Black cubes: set aside.
     - Colored cubes: deal 1 damage to that player.
     - Red cubes (if drawn): all players take 1 damage; return red cube to Clank! area.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Factions** (Outlaw, Resistance, Science): To use faction text on a card, play a different card of that faction during the same turn. Usable once per turn.
- **Clank!**: Noise attracts Eradikus. Managing Clank! is crucial.
- **Boss Marker** advances when:
  - A player completes a Command Code (2nd Data cube placed)
  - A player steals an Artifact
  - A player discovers an Archive (Minor Secret)
- **Rage Track Effects**:
  - **Dispatch Bounty Hunters**: When Boss Marker reaches red spaces, place red cubes in Clank! area. When drawn, all players take 1 damage; cube returns to Clank! area.
  - **Deploy Blockade**: When Boss Marker reaches final red space, place Blockade in Cargo Bay, blocking Hyperlift return.
- **Health & Damage**:
  - Track damage on Health Meter (max 5).
  - Heal via Med Kit, Data Port, or card effects.
  - If Health Meter fills:
    - With Artifact in Cargo Bay: score points.
    - Else: knocked out, no score.
- **Escaping**:
  - With Artifact, reach Escape Pod in Cargo Bay to escape (20 points).
  - If knocked out in Cargo Bay with Artifact, still score.
- **Player Elimination**:
  - Escaped or knocked out players no longer take turns.
  - On their turn, they draw 4 cubes (6 in 2P) from Boss Bag (ignoring Rage Track) — damage as normal.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Game End**: When all players have escaped or been knocked out.

**Scoring**:
- Artifact value
- Points from Secrets (Major/Minor)
- 1 point per Credit
- Points from cards in deck (top right corner)
- 20 points for escaping via pod
- 5 points each: Master Key, TelePass, Med Kit
- 10 points: Contraband
- 3 points per Power Crystal (including The Sixth Crystal)
- The Sixth Crystal: +3 points per Power Crystal (including itself)

**Winning**: Highest score wins. Tiebreaker: most valuable Artifact.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use Boots after Hyperlift/Telepad?** No — dizziness prevents Boot use until next turn.
- **Can I teleport through locks/checkpoints?** Yes — Teleport ignores locks, arrows, enemies, checkpoints.
- **Can I use faction ability after the card?** Yes — order doesn’t matter as long as both cards are played.
- **Running out of Clank!?** Cannot add Clank! if out of cubes. Cannot take damage from enemies if no cubes.
- **Empty Adventure Deck?** All remaining players are knocked out; game ends.
- **Market Items**: Limited; only one of each type per player.
- **Data Ports**: Cannot hack same module twice. Bonuses: Clank!, Credits, Healing, Power Crystal, Skill, Swords, Draw Card.
