## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In Journeys in Middle-earth, players take on the roles of heroes from Tolkien’s Middle-earth, embarking on narrative-driven adventures. The goal is to complete a series of objectives before the threat bar fills completely. The party wins the adventure by completing the final objective; otherwise, they lose. Adventures are part of a larger campaign where heroes gain experience, upgrade items, and grow stronger over time.

### 2. Components
- Hero figures and hero cards  
- Enemy figures and enemy portraits  
- Skill cards (Basic, Hero-specific, Role-specific, Title, Weakness)  
- Item cards (Armor, One-handed, Two-handed, Trinkets)  
- Damage, Fear, and Boon cards  
- Exploration, Search, Person, Threat, and Darkness tokens  
- Depletion tokens  
- Inspiration and Fate tokens  
- Enemy banner tokens (including Elite banners)  

### 3. Setup
- Each player selects a hero and takes the corresponding figure, hero card, and starting items.  
- Build a skill deck:  
  - 1 copy each of Basic skill cards #1–6  
  - Hero-specific skill cards #1–5  
  - Role-specific skill cards #1–3  
  - 1 Weakness card from the Weakness deck  
- Place the role starting card (#1) faceup below the hero card as prepared.  
- Shuffle the remaining cards to form the skill deck.  
- Set up the app, select roles, and follow app instructions to place map tiles, tokens, and heroes.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds in three phases:
1. **Action Phase**: Heroes take turns performing two actions (Travel, Attack, Interact).  
2. **Shadow Phase**: Enemies activate, darkness effects trigger, and threat increases.  
3. **Rally Phase**: Heroes reset decks, scout two cards, and may prepare one.  

Repeat until the adventure ends.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Tests**: Reveal a number of cards from your skill deck equal to the tested stat (Agility, Might, Spirit, Wisdom, Wit). Each success icon ( ) is 1 success. Fate icons ( ) can be converted to successes using inspiration.  
- **Attack Tests**: Choose an equipped item with a matching stat icon. Test the stat. Spend successes to activate item abilities (e.g., add hits, apply modifiers like Pierce or Lethal).  
- **Dual-Wielding**: Attack with multiple items if they share a common stat. All items must have the ranged icon to attack adjacent enemies.  
- **Enemy Activation**: The app assigns targets. Enemies move toward heroes and attack if in range. Ranged enemies can attack from adjacent spaces.  
- **Provoking Enemies**: Before moving out of or interacting in a space with a readied enemy, provoke an immediate attack.  
- **Readied/Exhausted Enemies**: Enemies are readied at the start of the Shadow Phase. After activating or attacking, they become exhausted (cannot activate or counterattack). Elite enemies can counterattack even when exhausted.  
- **Keywords**:  
  - **Scout X**: Reveal X cards, prepare one, place others on top/bottom of deck.  
  - **Strike X**: Discard to add X hits during an attack.  
  - **Guard X**: Discard to prevent X damage/fear.  
  - **Sprint X**: Discard to move X extra spaces.  
  - **Rest X**: Discard to remove X facedown damage/fear.  
  - **Hide**: Discard after a test to gain a Hidden boon.  
- **Trinkets**: Gain depletion tokens equal to the number on the card. Deplete by removing a token. When fully depleted, flip facedown. Reset at the start of each adventure.  
- **Boons**: Hidden, Emboldened, Determined — provide ongoing benefits.  
- **Terrain Effects**:  
  - **Darkness**: Heroes suffer fear (amount specified by app).  
  - **Difficult Ground**: Discard 1 card to move out in the same turn.  
  - **Fortified**: Cannot move out if outnumbered.  
  - **Stream**: Moving across ends the turn (hero or enemy).  
  - **Wall**: Blocks movement and adjacency.  
  - **Mist**: All damage suffered is facedown. Cannot convert fate icons to successes.  
  - **Fire Pit**: Discard a card with a fate icon during an attack to apply Pierce or Smite.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- The party wins if they complete the final objective before the threat bar fills.  
- The party loses if the threat bar fills or if all heroes fail last stands before completing the final objective.  
- **Last Stand**: When a hero’s damage or fear equals or exceeds their limit, they must perform a test. Failure results in defeat. If all heroes are defeated, the party loses at the start of the next Shadow Phase.  
- **Campaign Scoring (from LOTR-JIME Score Sheet)**:  
  - +30 per adventure won (Normal)  
  - +60 per adventure won (Hard)  
  - +100/+200/+400 for winning campaign on Adventure/Normal/Hard  
  - -25 per hero defeat  
  - -5 per weakness card in deck at campaign end  
  - +15 per title card  
  - +10 per trinket  
  - +1 per XP in skill cards  
  - +1 per lore point  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I prepare a Weakness card?** Yes, but it grants no abilities.  
- **When do Weakness cards activate?** Only when drawn during the Rally Phase. They are placed in play with Depletion tokens equal to the number on the card. One token is removed each Rally Phase before scouting.  
- **What happens if a hero gains multiple Weaknesses?** All are added to the deck during the adventure, but only the most recent is kept for the next adventure.  
- **Can elite enemies be stunned?** No — elite enemies have bonuses like “Immune to Stun” (Alert, Wary).  
- **Can I use inspiration to convert fate icons during a negate test?** Yes.  
- **Do prepared cards go into the discard pile during a test?** No — only revealed cards from the deck are discarded. Prepared cards remain in play.
