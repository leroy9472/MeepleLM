### 1. Lore & Objective
Players are citizens of Squall's End on a rescue mission to save cats from the Isle of Cats before Vesh Darkhand arrives. The goal is to rescue cats, gather treasures, and score the most points by completing lesson cards, forming cat families, and efficiently placing tiles on your boat while minimizing penalties.

### 2. Components
- 4 player boats (red cat side up for standard)
- 1 island board with day tracker
- Vesh’s boat marker
- 85 cat tiles (blue, green, orange, red, purple)
- 6 Oshax tiles (base), plus expansion variants
- 44 common treasures (4 shapes, limited supply)
- 25 rare treasure tiles (gold/yellow)
- 150 discovery cards:
  - Green: Rescue (60)
  - Purple: Anytime (31)
  - Yellow: Treasure (15)
  - Brown: Oshax (6)
  - Blue: Lessons (38 total base + modules)
- 30 wooden cat meeples (6 per color)
- 42 fish tokens (20x1, 22x5)
- 10 permanent basket tokens
- Discovery bag
- Scorepad

### 3. Setup
**Global Setup:**
1. Place island board center, red cat side up; place Vesh’s boat on space 5.
2. Place common treasures below island:
   - 2p: 5 per shape
   - 3p: 8 per shape
   - 4p: 11 per shape
   - 5–6p: 13–15 per shape
3. Place 6 Oshax tiles (8 for 5–6 players) near board.
4. Place wooden cats, fish, and permanent baskets in central supply.
5. Shuffle discovery cards into face-down deck:
   - Always include 14 core Lesson cards (#113–126)
   - 2–4 players: Add 3 full lesson modules (8 cards each)
   - 5–6 players: Add 5 full lesson modules
   - Include Kickstarter Pack cards (#244–255) optionally
   - Include Late Arrivals cards (#256–309) only with 5–6 players
6. Place discovery bag within reach; add all non-Oshax cat tiles and rare treasures.
7. Fill fields: draw 2 cats per player per field (left and right of island).

**Player Setup:**
1. Each player takes:
   - 1 random boat (red cat side)
   - 1 permanent basket (green side up)
2. Determine turn order; place player cat meeples on island trail accordingly.

### 4. Gameplay Flow (5 Rounds)
**Phase 1: Fishing**
- Each player takes 20 fish.

**Phase 2: Explore (Drafting)**
- Deal 7 cards to each player.
- Draft: Select 2, pass remaining left (Rounds 1,3,5) or right (Rounds 2,4); repeat until 7 cards held.
- Pay fish cost for desired cards; discard unkept cards face-down.
- Anytime cards may be played after payment.

**Phase 3: Read Lessons**
- Play all blue Lesson cards:
  - Private lessons: place face-down in front of you.
  - Public lessons: place face-up centrally, read aloud, choose color if required.
- All lesson cards must be played this phase; none may be held.

**Phase 4: Rescue Cats**
- Players simultaneously reveal green Rescue cards they will use.
- Total boot symbols determine new turn order (highest first; ties retain prior order).
- In turn order, players use baskets to rescue cats:
  - Pay 3 fish (left field) or 5 fish (right field).
  - Use 1 basket per cat (permanent basket flipped, temporary discarded).
  - 2 half-baskets = 1 full basket.
  - Place rescued cat immediately on boat:
    - First tile: anywhere.
    - Subsequent tiles: adjacent (orthogonal only) to existing tile.
  - Covering a matching color treasure map grants 1 common treasure (immediate placement).
- Continue until all pass or fields empty.
- Discard all used and unused played Rescue cards.

**Phase 5: Rare Finds**
- In turn order, play 1 brown Oshax or yellow Treasure card per turn.
- Continue until all pass.
- Oshax: take tile, place on boat, assign color with meeple.
- Treasure: take specified treasure, place on boat.
- Common treasures are limited; rare treasures are not.

**Round Cleanup**
- Return unrescued cats to box.
- Refill fields with 2 cats per player per field (draw from bag).
- Flip permanent baskets to active side.
- Advance Vesh’s boat 1 space.
- Unplayed cards and fish carry over.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Tile Placement:** First tile anywhere; all others adjacent (orthogonal only). Tiles may rotate/flip, must align with grid, not overlap.
- **Baskets:** Required to rescue cats. Types:
  - Permanent: reusable each round (flip after use).
  - Temporary: single-use (discard).
  - Half-baskets: 2 = 1 basket.
- **Treasure Maps:** 5 colored map icons on boat. Covering with matching cat grants 1 common treasure.
- **Oshax:** Wild cats; assign color when placed using wooden meeple. Count as that color for all purposes.
- **Anytime Cards (Purple):** May be played at any time, even during other players’ turns. Resolve fully before continuing.
- **Scoring Categories:**
  - Cat Families: 3+ same-color adjacent cats.
  - Rare Treasures: 3 points each.
  - Lessons: Points per completed card.
  - Penalties: -1 per visible rat, -5 per unfilled room.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after 5 rounds.

**Scoring:**
- **Cat Families:** 
  - 3 cats: +8
  - 4 cats: +11
  - 5 cats: +15

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Adjacent:** Orthogonal only; diagonals do not count.
- **Hand Limit:** None. Cards carry over.
- **Discarding:** Only your own cards/tiles. Public lessons cannot be discarded.
- **Treasure Maps:** Covering with matching cat (including Oshax of that color) grants 1 common treasure. Optional.
- **Tile Placement:** Tiles may cross room boundaries.
- **Oshax:** Count as assigned color for families, lessons, maps.
- **Anytime Cards:** Resolve fully before other actions. In conflicts, resolve in turn order.
- **Lesson Cards Drawn Late:** Cannot be played if drawn outside Phase 3, even with Anytime cards.
- **Unfillable Tile:** Cannot take if no legal placement exists.
- **Public Lessons:** Belong to no player once played; all can score.
