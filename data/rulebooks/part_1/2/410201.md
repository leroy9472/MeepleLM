   - Place the Dragon Guild board in the center. Randomly select and place one Dragon Guild tile face up (side depends on player count: 2–3 or 4–5 players).  
   - Place the card display board nearby. Shuffle all dragon cards and cave cards separately. Place 3 face-up dragons and 3 face-up caves on the display. Place remaining decks face down.  
   - Place the round tracker board with the round marker on Round 1. Shuffle the objective tiles and place 4 at random on the board, random side up. Return unused tiles to the box.  
   - Place all coins, eggs, and resource tokens (meat, gold, crystal, milk) in a public supply.

     - 1 egg (place on one of the two nest icons on your mat)  
     - 3 dragon cards and 3 cave cards (drawn from respective decks)  
   - Choose any 4 cards (dragons and/or caves) to keep; discard the other 2 face-up to respective discard piles.  
   - Choose 3 resources (any combination of meat, gold, crystal, milk) and place them in your supply.

3. **Start Player:**  
   - Randomly determine the first player and give them the start player marker.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- The game lasts **4 rounds**.  
- In each round, players take turns in clockwise order, beginning with the start player.  
- On your turn, choose **one** of three actions: **Excavate**, **Entice**, or **Explore**.  
- After taking an action, your turn ends. You must then:  
  - Discard down to **9 coins, 9 cards, and 9 resource tokens**.  
  - Return your adventurer to Base Camp (if exploring).  
- Players may pass at any time. Once passed, they cannot take more turns that round but may still benefit from others’ actions.  
- When all players have passed, the round ends and **Round End/Upkeep** begins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### **Excavate**  
- Select the **leftmost empty space** in one of your three caves (Crimson Cavern, Golden Grotto, Amethyst Abyss).  
- Pay:  
  - 1 coin (base cost)  
  - 0 eggs (for 2nd column), 1 egg (3rd), or 2 eggs (4th) — paid from any nest on your mat or dragons.  
- Play a cave card from your hand to that space.  
- In any order, optionally activate:  
  - **"When Played"** ability on the cave card (if you decline, opponents still may activate their part).  
  - **"When Covered"** ability on the mat space (only in 4th column: spend 3 items — resources, cards — to gain 1 coin).  
- Cave card color is purely aesthetic; any card fits any cave.  
- *Free Excavation:* If an ability lets you excavate for free, skip all costs.

#### **Entice**  
- Select a dragon card from your hand.  
- Pay:  
  - 1 coin (base cost)  
  - Resource cost (gold, crystal, meat, milk) shown on card; some require extra coin, egg, or milk.  
  - Use **Resource Exchange** at any time: 2 resources → 1 of another type.  
- Play the dragon to your mat:  
  - Must go into an **excavated**, **unoccupied** space.  
  - Must match at least one **preferred habitat** (shown on left of card).  
  - Must be placed **left to right** within a cave.  
- Gain the **"When Played"** ability (if any).  
- Note: Max 12 dragons on mat. Tucked cards do not count as dragons.

#### **Explore**  
- Choose one cave (Crimson Cavern, Golden Grotto, or Amethyst Abyss) to explore.  
- Pay cost:  
  - 1st time per cave per round: 1 coin  
  - 2nd time: 1 coin + 1 egg  
  - 3rd time: 1 coin + 2 eggs (max 3 visits per cave per round)  
  - Eggs paid from nests on mat or dragons.  
- Place paid coin and egg(s) on your mat to track visits.  
- Move adventurer **left to right** along the path.  
- Activate **"if activated"** abilities (🟥 icon) as you pass:  
  - You may activate each ability when you pass it.  
- Your turn ends when you reach a **Stop icon** (empty space). Return adventurer to Base Camp.

#### **Dragon Abilities**  
Dragons have four types of abilities:  
- **When Played** (🟦): Trigger immediately after playing.  
- **If Activated** (🟥): Trigger when your adventurer walks onto or past the dragon during Explore.  
- **Once Per Round** (🟨): Activate during Round End, in turn order. Owner chooses activation order if multiple.  
- **End Game** (🟩): Score at game end.

#### **Special: Hatchlings**  
- All hatchlings require **1 egg + 1–3 milk** to play.  
- Three-part ability:  
  1. **"If activated"**: When adventurer walks onto it, may cache milk/meat or tuck a card.  
  2. **"Any time"**: Whenever you cache or tuck, gain a benefit (regardless of trigger).  
  3. **"Once per game"**: On the **third** cache/tuck, gain regular benefit + bonus (hatchling "grows up").  
- After third activation, continue using first two abilities.  
- Most hatchlings live in **Amethyst Abyss**.

#### **Resource Exchange**  
At any time, exchange **2 resources** (any combo of meat, gold, crystal, milk) for **1 of another type**.

#### **Card Acquisition Terms**  
- **Gain a card**: Take from face-up display **or** top of deck.  
- **Gain from display**: Must take a face-up card; if none, cannot gain.  
- **Draw a card**: Take only from top of deck.  
- **Reveal a card**: Show top card; follow ability or return.

#### **Capacity Limits**  
At end of your turn, discard down to:  
- 9 coins  
- 9 cards (dragons + cave cards combined)  
- 9 resource tokens  
Excess gained during others’ turns is kept until your next turn.

#### **Dragon Guild**  
- Earn **advancements (⌒)** by:  
  - Playing certain dragons/cave cards  
  - Exploring caves (some spaces trigger advancements)  
- Each advancement: move guild token **1 space clockwise**, gain benefit on landing space.  
- If you pass multiple benefits, gain all.  
- When landing on a **brown space**, immediately:  
  - Place 1 player marker on an empty square of the Dragon Guild tile (max 1 per square, except bottom-right rectangle — unlimited).  
  - Gain the benefit shown.  
- Max **4 markers per player** on the tile. After 4th, continue advancing but cannot place more.  
- Multiple players on brown space same turn? Resolve in **clockwise order**, starting with active player.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after **Round 4**. Score VP as follows:  
1. **Dragon Guild Markers**: Score VP based on end-game criteria on each square where you placed a marker.  
2. **Dragon VP**: Sum VP values on **visible** (not tucked, not in hand) dragons.  
3. **End Game Abilities (🟩)**: Score all end-game abilities on visible dragons.  
4. **Eggs**: 1 VP per egg on dragons or mat.  
5. **Cached Resources**: 1 VP per resource cached on dragons.  
6. **Tucked Cards**: 1 VP per tucked dragon card (under dragons).  
7. **Public Objectives**: Score VP from round objectives (on round tracker).  
   - Ties are **friendly**: all tied for 1st get 1st-place VP; next gets 2nd, etc.  
   - If you have **zero** toward objective, place marker on "all others" (0 VP).  
8. **Excess Items**:  
   - 1 VP per **remaining coin**.  
   - 1 VP per **4 leftover items** (resources, dragon cards, cave cards — combined, round down).

**Winning:**  
- Highest VP wins.  
- Tie? Player with **most visible dragons** wins.  
- Still tied? Shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a dragon without excavating?** No. All spaces must be excavated first.  
- **Do tucked cards count as dragons?** No. For abilities or objectives requiring number/type of dragons, only visible dragons count.  
- **Can I cache resources from supply?** Yes, unless specified otherwise.  
- **Can I use resource exchange during payment?** Yes, at any time.  
- **What if display runs out of cards?** Refill only at end of each player’s turn. During turn, "gain" abilities may still draw from deck.  
- **Can I explore a cave more than 3 times?** No. Max 3 times per cave per round.  
- **Do "once per round" abilities trigger if I pass?** Yes. All players activate them during Round End, even if passed.  
- **Can I lay an egg if no nest is empty?** No. Each nest (on dragons or mat) holds only 1 egg.  
- **Can I pay eggs from any location?** Yes, unless ability specifies (e.g., "pay from this cave").  
- **Does a dragon count itself for ability checks?** Yes. If an ability checks for "playful dragons in this cave," it includes itself if applicable.
