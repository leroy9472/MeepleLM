# 1. Lore & Objective
Pandemic is a cooperative game where players take on roles in a disease control team racing to discover cures for four deadly diseases (Blue, Yellow, Black, Red) before outbreaks overwhelm the world. The team wins by discovering cures for all four diseases. The game ends in defeat if:
- The 8th outbreak occurs,
- There are no disease cubes left of a color when needed,
- The player draw pile runs out when drawing cards.

# 2. Components
- Game board with city map
- 5 pawns and matching role cards
- 6 research stations
- 96 disease cubes (24 each of 4 colors)
- 59 player cards (city cards and event cards)
- 48 infection cards
- 6 Epidemic cards
- 4 reference cards
- Markers: Outbreaks, Infection Rate, Cure (vial and sunset sides)

# 3. Setup
1. Place the board in the center.
2. Shuffle role cards and deal one to each player. Place each pawn in Atlanta.
3. Place one research station in Atlanta; others near the board.
4. Set Outbreaks Marker to 0 and Infection Rate Marker to the first space (marked "2").
5. Place cure markers (vial-side up) near the Cures Discovered area.
6. Separate disease cubes by color near the board.
7. Remove 6 Epidemic cards from the player deck and set aside.
8. Shuffle remaining player cards and deal:
   - 4 players: 2 cards each
   - 3 players: 3 cards each
   - 2 players: 4 cards each
9. Divide remaining player cards into piles:
   - Introductory: 4 piles
   - Normal: 5 piles
   - Heroic: 6 piles
   Shuffle one Epidemic card into each pile, then stack to form the Player Draw Pile.
10. Shuffle infection cards to form the Infection Draw Pile.
11. Infect cities:
   - Draw 3 infection cards: place 3 cubes each in the cities shown.
   - Draw 3 more: place 2 cubes each.
   - Draw 3 more: place 1 cube each.
   Discard all 9 cards face-up to the Infection Discard Pile.
12. The player who was most recently sick goes first.

# 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of three phases:
1. **Take 4 Actions**: Choose from movement, treatment, research, and sharing actions.
2. **Draw 2 Player Cards**: Draw from the Player Draw Pile. If an Epidemic card is drawn, resolve it immediately.
3. **Infect Cities**: Draw a number of Infection cards equal to the current Infection Rate and add one cube of the matching color to each city.

# 5. Core Mechanics
## Actions (1 action each)
- **Drive/Ferry**: Move to adjacent city (connected by red line).
- **Direct Flight**: Discard a city card to move to that city.
- **Charter Flight**: Discard the card matching your current city to move to any city.
- **Shuttle Flight**: Move from one research station to another.
- **Pass**: Do nothing.
- **Treat Disease**: Remove 1 disease cube from your city. If the disease is cured, remove all cubes of that color in one action.
- **Build Research Station**: Discard the card matching your city to build a station. If none remain, move an existing one.
- **Share Knowledge**: Transfer a city card matching your current city with another player in the same city.
- **Discover a Cure**: At a research station, discard 5 cards of the same color to cure that disease. Scientist needs only 4 cards.

## Special Role Abilities
- **Dispatcher**: Move another player's pawn as if it were your own (with permission), or move any pawn to a city containing another pawn.
- **Medic**: Remove all cubes of one color in a city with Treat Disease. Automatically remove all cubes of a cured disease upon entering or being in a city (no action required).
- **Operations Expert**: Build a research station without discarding a card. Once per turn, move from a research station to any city by discarding any city card.
- **Scientist**: Needs only 4 cards of the same color to discover a cure.
- **Researcher**: Can give any city card (not just matching city) to another player in the same city.
- **Contingency Planner**: Retrieve one Event card from the discard pile and hold it on role card (does not count toward hand limit). Play it later and remove it from the game.

## Epidemic Resolution
When an Epidemic card is drawn:
1. **Increase**: Move Infection Rate Marker up one space.
2. **Infect**: Draw the bottom card from the Infection Draw Pile, add 3 cubes of that color to the city. If the city already has cubes, add until it has 3, then trigger outbreak if needed.
3. **Intensify**: Shuffle the Infection Discard Pile and place it on top of the Infection Draw Pile.

## Infection Phase
- Draw number of Infection cards equal to current Infection Rate.
- For each card, add one cube of the matching color to the city.
- If a city already has 3 cubes of that color, an outbreak occurs.

## Outbreaks
- When a 4th cube of a color would be placed in a city, instead place 1 cube of that color in each adjacent city.
- Each such placement may trigger chain reaction outbreaks.
- Move the Outbreaks Marker up one space per outbreak.
- A city can only outbreak once per chain reaction.

## Hand Management
- Hand limit is 7 cards.
- After drawing cards (including resolving Epidemics), discard down to 7 if needed.
- Can play Event cards instead of discarding.
- Player and Infection discard piles may be examined at any time.

## Event Cards
- Can be played at any time (even on another player's turn), except between drawing and resolving an infection card.
- Do not require an action to play.
- Discard to Player Discard Pile after use.

## Eradication
- When a disease is cured and all its cubes are removed from the board, flip its cure marker to the sunset side.
- Cards of that color have no effect when drawn during infection.

# 6. Scoring & End Game
## Victory
- Win immediately when cures for all four diseases are discovered.
- No need to eradicate or treat all infected cities.

## Defeat
Game ends in defeat if:
- Cannot place required disease cubes (supply exhausted).
- 8th outbreak occurs.
- Cannot draw 2 player cards when required.

# 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Chain Reactions**: Each city can only outbreak once per chain reaction, even if multiple conditions would trigger it.
- **Multiple Epidemics**: If two Epidemic cards are drawn, resolve both completely in sequence.
- **Cured Diseases**: Medic automatically removes all cubes of a cured disease in a city upon entering (no action). Medic also prevents placement of cubes of cured diseases in their current city.
- **Hand Limit**: Always enforced. Must discard or play Event cards to stay at 7.
- **Research Stations**: Can have multiple stations in one city. When building and none remain, move an existing one.
- **Event Timing**: Events can be played between infection card draws, but not between drawing and resolving a single card.
- **Role Powers**: Cannot opt out of role abilities. They are always active.
