## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Your goal is total global domination by scoring 15 Victory Points (VP). Use your minions to gain control of bases and score VPs when bases are scored. The first player to reach 15 VP wins. If multiple players have 15+ VP at the end of a turn, the one with the most VP wins. In case of a tie for the lead, play continues until the tie is broken.

2. Components  
- 8 factions (20 cards each), totaling 160 cards  
- 16 base cards  
- This rulebook  

3. Setup  
- Each player selects two different 20-card factions and shuffles them into a 40-card deck.  
- Shuffle all base cards into a deck. Place a number of bases face up in the center equal to the number of players + 1 (e.g., 4 bases for 3 players).  
- Each player draws 5 cards. If a player has no minions in their starting hand, they may reveal it, discard it, and draw 5 new cards (which must be kept).  
- Randomly determine the starting player (e.g., whoever got up earliest). Play proceeds clockwise.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, follow these steps in order:  
1. **Start of Turn**: Resolve any abilities that trigger at the start of your turn.  
2. **Play Cards**: You may play:  
   - One minion, one action, one of each, or none.  
   - Play in any order.  
   - Minions: Place beside a base, facing you. Resolve its ability.  
   - Actions: Reveal and resolve ability, then discard unless Ongoing.  
   - Special abilities used during your turn do not count toward your play limit.  
3. **Check for Scoring**:  
   - If any base has total minion power ≥ its breakpoint, it scores.  
   - If multiple bases are ready, the current player chooses which to score first.  
   - Scoring process:  
     a. **Before Scoring**: Players may use Special abilities that trigger “before” scoring. Even if power drops below breakpoint, scoring continues.  
     b. **Award VPs**:  
        - 1st place (highest power): left VP number  
        - 2nd place: middle VP number  
        - 3rd place: right VP number  
        - Ties: All tied players receive VPs for the highest position they tied for. No lower positions are awarded.  
        - Must have at least one minion on base to score.  
     c. **After Scoring**: Players may use Special abilities that trigger “after” scoring.  
     d. **Clean Up**: All cards on the base go to their owners’ discard piles. The base is discarded and replaced with the top card of the base deck (shuffle discard if needed).  
   - Re-evaluate for additional scoring after each base is resolved.  
4. **Draw 2 Cards**: Draw 2 cards. If hand exceeds 10 cards, discard down to 10.  
5. **End of Turn**: Resolve any abilities that trigger at the end of your turn. Then pass to the next player.  
- If a deck is empty when drawing, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Minions**: Played to bases. Contribute power. Abilities trigger when played.  
- **Actions**: One-time effects. Discard after use unless Ongoing.  
- **Ongoing**: Abilities remain active while in play.  
- **Special**: Can be used at specified times, even on other players’ turns. Using a Special to play a card does not count toward your turn’s play limit.  
- **Move**: Relocate a minion between bases. Does not count as playing it; on-play abilities do not trigger.  
- **Destroy**: Remove a card from play and place in owner’s discard pile.  
- **Return**: Send a card back to its owner’s hand. Discard any attachments.  
- **Discard**: Send a card to its owner’s discard pile.  
- **Extra Plays**: Cards allowing extra minion or action plays do not count toward your limit. Must be played during the same phase unless otherwise specified. If granted during scoring, must be played immediately or not at all.  
- **Power**: Always use current modified power (not printed power) for comparisons and effects.  
- **Card Resolution Order**:  
  1. Resolve the card just played.  
  2. Finish resolving any pending effects.  
  3. Current player chooses order of triggered abilities.  
  4. Resolve hand-based triggered abilities clockwise from current player.  
  5. Discard the original card (unless played on another card).  
- **Control**: You control cards you play. Gaining control of a minion means it contributes to your power and you use its abilities. Does not affect control of actions on it.  
- **Owner**: The player who started with the card. Cards always return to their owner’s zones.  
- **Discard Piles**: Any player may look through any discard pile at any time.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- A base scores when total minion power ≥ its breakpoint.  
- VPs awarded based on power ranking:  
  - 1st: left number  
  - 2nd: middle number  
  - 3rd: right number  
- Tie rules:  
  - 10, 10, 5 → 1st, 1st, 3rd  
  - 10, 8, 8, 5 → 1st, 2nd, 2nd, no points  
  - 10, 8, 8, 3 → 1st, 2nd, 2nd, no points  
- After scoring, check if any player has ≥15 VP. If yes, the player with the most VP wins. If tied, continue playing.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Card vs Rule Conflict**: Card text always overrides rulebook text.  
- **Ability Conflicts**: “Cannot” beats “can.”  
- **Simultaneous Effects**: Current player chooses resolution order.  
- **Using Abilities**: Must follow all instructions unless “may” is used.  
- “Any number” includes zero. “All” may be used even with no targets.  
- **Playing Cards with No Valid Target**: Allowed. Helps cycle hand.  
- **Extra Plays Timing**: Must be played immediately if granted by Special, during scoring, or if conditional (e.g., “reveal top card…”). Otherwise, can be held.  
- **Attached Cards**: Actions played “on a base” or “on a minion” stay until base/minion leaves play or is destroyed. Move with minion if moved. Discarded when base scores or minion is destroyed/returned.  
- **Immunity**: If a minion is immune to destruction, it survives even if effect targets it.  
- **Base Replacement**: When a base is replaced, all minions stay on the new base. Actions attached to the old base are discarded.
