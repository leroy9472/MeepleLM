## Islebound Solo Rules Reference (AI Mode)

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In Islebound, players compete to earn the most renown by building a powerful capital city, controlling island towns, and gaining wealth. In solo mode, the human player competes against an AI-controlled opponent. The AI follows deterministic rules to simulate a strategic rival. The first player (human) to own 8 buildings triggers the endgame (per 2-player rules). The player with the most renown wins.

### 2. Components  
- Islebound base game components:  
  - Sea boards, port tiles, ship boards, cubes (20 per player), ships  
  - Coins (copper and silver), fish, wood, book tokens  
  - Crew, pirates, sea serpents, dice  
  - Building cards, event cards, reputation cards, renown tokens  
  - Victory/renown board, influence track, building row  
- No additional components required for solo play.

### 3. Setup  
- **Board Setup**:  
  - Assemble 4 sea boards in center, place 4 sea ports (Borsham, Crimsika, Krazk, Marhaven) at corners. All text must face same direction.  
  - Place event markers on regions matching face-up event cards on renown board.  

- **Player Setup**:  
  - Human player:  
    - Choose home port, place 1 cube and ship.  
    - Receive: 7 coins, 1 ship board, 3 starting crew (2 "administer", 1 "work"), 20 cubes.  
    - Place 1 cube below "2" on movement track (base speed = 2).  
  - AI Setup:  
    - AI receives 7 starting coins.  
    - AI has no ship tableau, crew, or home port.  
    - Place AI ship on a sea region (determine randomly via d6: 1=N, 2=NE, 3=E, 4=SE, 5=S, 6=SW).  
    - AI ship always remains at sea, never enters ports.  
    - Place 2 neutral influence cubes on first two spaces of influence track (2-player rule).  

- **Card Setup**:  
  - Shuffle event cards → 2 face-up piles on renown board.  
  - Shuffle reputation cards → 2 face-up piles above trumpet symbol.  
  - Shuffle crew (2-skill) deck → draw 3 face-up.  
  - Shuffle building deck → draw 5 face-up.  
    - Place building track tokens:  
      - 3-book token over 1st card (leftmost)  
      - 2-book token over 2nd card  
      - 1-book token over 3rd card  
      - Cards 4 and 5 have no book requirement.  

- **Turn Order**: Human player goes first.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in turns:  
1. **Human Turn**:  
   - Move ship (up to speed).  
   - Perform 1 main action + any free actions.  
   - May trigger brag cards or events.  
2. **AI Turn (after human turn)**:  
   - AI only acts when human passes; if human passes, AI passes and round ends.  
   - AI actions occur after human completes full turn.  
   - AI does **not** take port actions, visit towns, or spend money from supply.  
   - AI never places money on treasure map.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### AI Movement  
Roll d6:  
- 1: AI stays  
- 2–3: Move 1 region clockwise  
- 4–5: Move 2 regions clockwise  
- 6: Move 3 regions clockwise  

#### AI Action (Roll d6 after movement)  
If **5+ gold on treasure map**, AI takes **"Hunt for Treasure"** action instead.  
Otherwise, roll d6:  

1. **Gain 3 Influence**  
   - Place 3 AI cubes on leftmost available spaces of influence track.  
   - If track fills, AI immediately allies with highest-cost town in current region (paying required influence). If unaffordable, check next region clockwise.  

2. **Diplomacy**  
   - AI takes control of port with **lowest diplomacy value** in current region.  
   - Must be unowned by AI and affordable via influence track.  
   - Remove required cubes from left.  
   - Gain spoils = banner value.  
   - If target is human-owned: +2 influence required.  
   - If impossible: add **1 influence cube** to track.  

3. **Hire 3 Pirates**  
   - AI takes 3 pirates into supply.  

4. **Attack**  
   - AI takes control of port with **lowest attack value** in current region.  
   - Must be unowned by AI and can pay via pirates (1 pirate = 2 attack strength).  
   - Discard required pirates.  
   - Gain spoils = banner value.  
   - If target is human-owned: +2 attack required.  
   - If impossible: no effect.  

5. **Building Purchase (AI < 4 Buildings)**  
   - Take **2 cheapest** available buildings at **no cost**.  
   - If AI ≥ 4 buildings: take **1 cheapest** building + gain **1 influence cube**.  
   - Book requirements ignored.  
   - If multiple same-cost: take **rightmost**.  
   - If cannot afford cheapest: take none.  
   - If <6 buildings available: AI places 1 cube on influence track.  

6. **Buy Most Expensive Building + Hunt for Treasure**  
   - Take **most expensive** available building at **no cost** (rightmost if tie).  
   - Then take **all coins** from treasure map.  
   - If cannot afford most expensive: take no building.  

#### Special AI Rules  
- **Close-Quarters Variant**:  
  - If human ship enters AI’s region, human must exhaust 1 administer crew **and pay 1 coin to AI**.  
  - No close-quarters during AI movement.  
- **Brag Cards**:  
  - When resolving, AI **always has at least 2 of the called resource**.  
  - This is the **only way AI gains renown**.  
- **AI Building Scoring**:  
  - AI **only counts purchase cost** of buildings for endgame scoring.  
  - Ignores building bonuses and endgame renown abilities.  
- **AI Treasure Purchase**:  
  - When AI reaches **14 or 16 gold** (variant dependent), it **automatically buys top renown token** for 7 gold.  
  - AI gains the benefit (e.g., fish, wood, crew).  

- **AI Port Visits**:  
  - Human pays AI **spoils amount** when visiting AI-controlled town.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Game Trigger**:  
  - When **any player (human or AI) owns 8 buildings**, finish current round.  
  - All players get **1 final turn**.  
  - Game ends after.  

- **Scoring (All Players)**:  
  - **Unspent coins**: 1 renown each  
  - **Buildings**: Value = purchase cost (renown on banner)  
  - **Building Bonuses**: Only human gains special endgame renown from buildings  
  - **Renown Track**: Position = renown  
  - **Renown Tokens**: Each = 7 renown  
  - **AI-Specific**:  
    - Only counts building **purchase costs**, **coins**, and **renown track/tokens**  
    - **+1 renown per 2 fish/wood** (if variant rule active)  

- **Win Condition**:  
  - Highest total renown wins.  
  - Tie: Most fish and wood.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Does AI ever spend money?**

  A: By coin cost on banner. Tie: take **rightmost** in row.
