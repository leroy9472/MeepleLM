### 1. Lore & Objective
Shogun (also known as Samurai Swords or Ikusa) is a strategic board game set in feudal Japan, where players take on the roles of rival Daimyos vying for dominance. The primary objective varies depending on the victory condition used:

- In the classic version, the goal is to control 35 provinces.
- In the Victory Point (VP) variant, players accumulate VP through territorial control, castle and fortress ownership, Daimyo experience, and eliminating enemy Daimyos. The game ends after a set number of rounds (number of players + 2), and the player with the most VP wins. Optional "Overtime" rules may extend the game if scores are close.

An alternative "New Way to Win" variant replaces province control with objective cards that award Victory Points (VP) for achievements like winning battles, capturing castles, or completing strategic paths.

### 2. Components

### 3. Setup
1. **Login & Host Setup**:
   - All players log in to the web interface at ausoft.us/shogun.
   - The host assigns each player a color via dropdown menus and clicks "New Game."

2. **Game Assignment**:
   - Each player selects the same Game # displayed on their interface.
   - Players can switch between colors using the "You" dropdown if playing multiple factions.

3. **Initial Unit Placement**:
   - **5-Turn Setup**: Players place one additional spearman at a time over five turns.
   - **2-Turn Setup**: Clicking a territory places two spearmen at once.
   - After placing spearmen, players place their three armies by clicking red bouncy dots.

4. **Visibility**:
   - Hidden units (ronin, extra spearmen, castles/fortresses during build) are visible only to the owning player until revealed.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of the following phases, repeated until the game ends:

1. **Planning Phase**:
   - Players allocate koku (funds) using dropdowns on their army boards.
   - Bidding determines turn order and who hires the Ninja.
   - Turn order is displayed in the player status grid.

2. **Build Phase**:
   - Players may build castles (subject to map limits and rules).
   - In the "Fixed Castles" variant, no building is allowed; all castles and fortresses are pre-placed.

3. **Levy Units Phase**:
   - Purchase and place additional units (samurai, ashigaru, bowmen, gunners, swordsmen, ronin) using available koku.

4. **Wage War Phase**:
   - Conducted in player turn order.
   - Sub-phases:
     a. **Move Units**: Armies and provincial forces move according to Daimyo experience level.
     b. **Declare Battles**: Mark battles using arrows or dropdowns.
     c. **Battle Phase**: Combat resolved automatically; results shown privately.
     d. **Final Move Phase**: Remaining movement for armies and provisional units.

5. **Final Movement (Armies & Provisional Units)**:
   - Armies may move based on Daimyo level; must leave garrisons when vacating provinces.
   - Provisional units (e.g., ronin) can be moved by clicking and selecting destination.

6. **Refresh Requirement**:
   - After any player clicks "Next," others must manually click "Refresh" to see updated game state.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Turn Order**: Determined by koku bids for swords (1–5 diamonds); higher bid gets earlier turn.
- **Ninja**:
  - Hired via bid; grants ability to assassinate enemy Daimyos.
  - If successful, grants 1 Permanent Victory Point (PVP).
  - Triggers "Revenge Strike" if assassination fails.
- **Combat**:
  - Resolved automatically by game engine.
  - Units hit on die rolls: Spearmen/Bowmen/Gunners (4+), Swordsmen/Ronin (5+), Daimyos/Ninja (6+).
  - Casualties must be manually removed after each battle.
- **Movement**:
  - Armies move in Phase A (friendly territories only), Phase C (after winning a battle), and Phase D (any direction).
  - Provincial forces move only in Phase D into adjacent friendly or empty provinces.
  - Maximum 5 units per province at end of Phase D.
- **Stacking Limits**:
  - Provincial Forces: Up to 5 units.
  - Armies: 1 Daimyo + up to 14 units (max 4 Samurai, 10 Ashigaru).
- **Daimyo Experience**:
  - Gains experience by winning battles.
  - Level 2+: Move in Phase C.
  - Level 3+: Fight up to 3 battles per round.
  - Level 4+: Fight up to 4 battles per round.

    - 1 VP per castle (2 VP if province has castle)
