### 1. Lore & Objective

**Coalition**: Multinational forces tasked with nation-building after the Taliban's ouster. The goal is to build popular support for the Afghan government and withdraw troops successfully. Victory is achieved when Total Support plus Available Coalition Troops exceeds 30.

**Government**: Represents the Afghan central authority. Must project force and maintain influence through patronage. Victory is achieved when COIN-Controlled Population plus Patronage exceeds 35.

**Warlords**: Regional power brokers (Tajik, Uzbek, minorities) focused on autonomy, opium trade, and local control. Victory is achieved when Uncontrolled Afghan Population exceeds 15 and Warlord Resources exceed 40.

**Taliban**: Ousted regime regaining support through insurgency and Sharia. Victory is achieved when Total Opposition plus Taliban Bases exceeds 20.

After the final Propaganda Round, the faction closest to its victory condition wins. Ties favor Non-players (Warlords > Taliban > Government > Coalition).
