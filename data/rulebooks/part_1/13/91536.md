4. Attack Your Rivals  
5. Capture One Quarry Die from the Wilds (optional)

5. Core Mechanics  
- Dice Locations:  
  - Bag: Not in play; drawn during Phase 2.  
  - Active Pool: Dice rolled each turn; used to gain Quiddity, summon, or trigger Immediate Effects.  
  - Ready Area: Summoned Creatures and readied Spells; used to attack or cast spells.  
  - Used Pile: Spent or destroyed dice; returned to bag when needed.  
- Spending Dice: Moving a die from Active Pool or Ready Area to the Used Pile to activate its effect.  
- Quiddity: Magic resource gained from spending Quiddity-symbol dice. Used to summon Creatures or capture Quarry. Lost at end of turn if unspent.  
- Immediate Effects: Abilities (e.g., Draw, Re-roll) used right after rolling dice. Optional and resolved in any order.  
- Ready Spells: Move Spell Icon dice from Active Pool to Ready Area (no cost).  
- Summon Creatures: Spend Quiddity equal to the Creature’s Level (top-left of die) to move it to Ready Area.  
- Attack:  
  - All Creatures in Ready Area attack all opponents.  
  - Total attack values (including attached Spells) to get attack total.  
  - Each opponent defends one Creature at a time. If attack ≥ defense, Creature is destroyed and moved to Used Pile. Remaining damage carries over.  
- Capture: Spend Quiddity to buy one Quarry die from the Wilds (cost listed on Power Card). Captured die goes to Used Pile.  
- Culling: After scoring, may return one die per scored Creature from Used Pile to its Power Card in the Wilds.  
- Burst: Special abilities triggered only if die face shows a Burst symbol. Effect listed on matching Power Card.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Scoring: Creatures in Ready Area at start of turn earn Glory (value on Power Card). Scored Creatures move to Used Pile.  
- Winning:  
  - A player wins immediately upon reaching the Glory goal:  
    - 2 players: 20 Glory  
    - 3 players: 15 Glory  
    - 4 players: 12 Glory  
  - If 4 or more Creature Power Cards in the Wilds are empty after a capture, the game ends. The player with the most Glory wins. Tiebreaker: most dice in Ready Area; if still tied, shared victory.
