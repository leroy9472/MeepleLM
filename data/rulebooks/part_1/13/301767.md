## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Mysterium Park*, one player takes on the role of the **cluemaster** (a ghost), while the others are **detectives** (psychics). The detectives have six turns to solve a mystery by identifying the correct **culprit** and **crime scene** from a set of suspects and locations. The cluemaster gives **visual clues** to guide the detectives toward the truth without speaking or directly indicating answers.

The game is won if, in Round 3, all detectives collectively identify the correct culprit and crime scene. If the detectives fail to do so before the sixth turn, or if they make an incorrect final guess, all players lose.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the main board in the center.  
2. Seat players so all detectives can view the board and clue cards upright (avoid upside-down viewing).  
3. The **cluemaster** randomly draws and keeps **3 small plot cards** — do not reveal to detectives at any time.  
4. Each **detective** chooses a color (preferably white, yellow, or blue to avoid confusion with red/purple on plot cards).  
   - Places one large colored circle and one pawn in front of them.  
   - Unused colors return to the box.  
5. Cluemaster places the **3 key tokens** in front of them.  
6. Place the **black witness token** aside.  
7. Shuffle the **visual clue card deck** (green back) and place it near the cluemaster. Draw **7 cards** to form the starting hand.  
8. Randomly select **9 character cards** (from clown-backed deck) for Round 1.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in up to **3 rounds**. There is **no turn order** — detectives act simultaneously after receiving clues.

#### Round 1 – Eliminate Innocent Characters  
1. Place the 9 character cards face up on the 3x3 board.  
2. Cluemaster draws **one** of their 3 plot cards — this determines the correct character for each detective’s color.  
3. Cluemaster gives **1 or more visual clue cards** to **one detective at a time**.  
   - After giving clues, cluemaster draws back up to 7 cards.  
4. Detectives examine their clues and place their **pawn** on the character they believe is correct (based on their color).  
   - Multiple detectives may choose the same character.  
5. After all have chosen:  
   - Cluemaster checks if any detective selected the **witness** (marked on plot card).  
     - If yes: remove that character card, place **black witness token** on the spot.  
     - Detectives who chose it must pick a new character.  
     - All other detectives may **reconsider and change** their choice.  
6. Cluemaster privately tells **each detective** whether they selected the **correct character** for their color:  
   - **Correct**: Remove that character card from the game. Detective returns pawn and discards clue cards.  
   - **Incorrect**: Detective keeps clue cards. Character remains.  
7. After all feedback, **advance the game turn marker** by one.  
8. Repeat the process (giving new clues, re-choosing, etc.) until **all detectives have correctly identified** their assigned character.  
   - Once all are correct, end Round 1.  
   - Cluemaster keeps the **3 character cards** corresponding to the blank spots on the plot card (these are suspects for Round 3).  
   - Discard all other character cards.  

#### Round 2 – Eliminate Locations  
1. Randomly select **9 location cards** (big top tent back) and place on the board.  
2. Repeat **same procedure** as Round 1:  
   - Cluemaster draws second plot card (maps locations to detective colors).  
   - Gives visual clues.  
   - Detectives select locations.  
   - Cluemaster gives feedback.  
   - Advance turn marker after each round.  
3. If turn marker goes beyond 6 at any point, **game ends — all lose**.  
4. When all detectives have correctly identified their assigned location:  
   - Remove those 3 location cards.  
   - Cluemaster keeps the **3 location cards** from the blank spots (suspects for Round 3).  
   - Discard others.  

#### Round 3 – Reveal Culprit and Crime Scene  
1. Place the **3 kept character cards** across the **middle row** of the board.  
2. Place the **3 kept location cards** directly **below** them (forming 3 columns: each with 1 character + 1 location).  
3. Cluemaster draws the **third plot card** and looks at the **Roman numeral** (I, II, or III) at the top — this indicates the correct column (culprit + crime scene).  
4. Cluemaster selects **two visual clue cards**:  
   - One to represent the **character**, one for the **location**.  
   - Reveals both cards **face up** to all detectives — **without saying which clue is for which**.  
5. Detectives **discuss** and must **reach unanimous agreement** on which column (I, II, or III) is correct.  
6. They announce their choice:  
   - **Correct**: All players **win**.  
   - **Incorrect**: All players **lose**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Visual Clue Giving**: Cluemaster uses abstract image cards to hint at characters/locations. No verbal or physical cues allowed.  
- **Simultaneous Deduction**: Detectives interpret clues independently but may discuss only in Round 3.  
- **Key Tokens (3 total)**:  
  - Cluemaster may use **up to 3 times** during the game (once per token).  
  - Effect: Discard any number of visual clue cards and redraw to have 7 again.  
  - Can be used at any time, even mid-round.  
- **Turn Progression**:  
  - One turn = one full cycle of clue-giving, selection, and feedback.  
  - Turn marker advances **after each full round of feedback**, regardless of how many detectives were correct.  
  - Maximum of **6 turns** total across all rounds.  

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
There is **no scoring** — the game is cooperative with binary outcome.

**Win Condition**:  
- Detectives correctly identify the **correct column (I, II, or III)** in Round 3.  
- All players win.

**Loss Conditions**:  
- Game reaches turn **7** (after 6 turns) — **all lose**.  
- Detectives guess the **wrong column** in Round 3 — **all lose**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can detectives talk during Rounds 1 and 2?**  
  No. Only in **Round 3** may they discuss freely. Before that, no communication is allowed.

- **Can a detective change their choice after feedback?**  
  Only after the **witness** is revealed may detectives change their choice. After feedback, choices are locked until the next turn.

- **What if the cluemaster runs out of visual clue cards?**  
  They draw back up to 7 after giving clues to each detective. Deck is reshuffled if needed.

- **Can the cluemaster give different numbers of clue cards to different detectives?**  
  Yes. The number is at their discretion (1 or more per detective, per turn).

- **Can the same visual clue card be used more than once?**  
  Yes, as long as it remains in the cluemaster’s hand. Cards are only discarded when used with key tokens or by choice.

- **What if multiple detectives are assigned the same character/location on the plot card?**  
  The plot cards are designed so each detective has a unique assignment per round.
