## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Prodigals Club is a secret fraternity of young gentlemen who compete to offend high society by losing wealth, votes, and social influence. Players engage in three simultaneous competitions: **Possessions**, **Election**, and **Society**. In each, the goal is to reduce your score to zero or below.  

Your **final score** is your **highest score** across the three competitions. The **player with the lowest final score wins**. Ties are broken by comparing second-highest scores, then third if needed.

The game ends immediately at the end of any round if:
- Any player’s score in any competition is zero or less, or  
- Five rounds have been completed.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Possessions Competition  
- **Goal**: Reduce score (money + possessions penalty) to ≤ 0.  
- **Sell**: Discard 1 possession → gain £ equal to value, minus discounts (e.g., -£1 if from current Borough).  
- **Sell Two**: Optional second sale; discounts apply per sale.  
- **Exchange**: Swap 1 of your possessions with 1 on board.  
  - If loss exceeds action limit, gain £ to compensate.  
  - Borough discount does **not** apply.  
- **Spend Money**: Pay indicated £ to bank.  
- **A Little More Time Cards**: Spend to increase money spent on certain actions.  
- **Debt Rule**:  
  - While you have possessions: cannot go into debt.  
  - Once possessions are gone: may go into debt (score < 0).  

#### Election Competition  
- **Goal**: Reduce Vote count to ≤ 0.  
- **Political Circle Tiles**:  
  - Place adjacent; edges must match:  
    - Same symbol = match  
    - ? = wild (matches any symbol, not another ?)  
    - Blank = only matches blank  
  - Matching gives 1 symbol of that type.  
  - **Inner Circle (2×2 square)**: Choose 2 rewards:  
    - Lose 1 Vote  
    - Spend £1  
    - Move 1 Influence marker down 1  
    - (May choose same reward twice)  
- **Lose Votes**: Direct vote reduction.  
- **Megaphones**: Used in Hyde Park. Counted from:  
  - Cards played  
  - Errand actions  
  - Bonus tiles  
  - Keep white cards with megaphones visible until Hyde Park.  

#### Society Competition  
- **Goal**: Reduce Influence score (sum of values under markers) to ≤ 0.  
- **Move Markers**:  
  - Must move into **empty spaces**.  
  - Multiple moves: one at a time, may skip some.  
- **Symbols**: Gained while marker is on a symbol space. Used in card combos.  
- **Dame Beatrice**: Forces upward movement; blocked moves → penalize another marker.  

#### Central & Bonus Mechanics  
- **Renaissance Man Tile**: Grants 2 symbols (chosen when used) for card combos.  
- **Bonus Action Tiles**: One-time use:  
  - Lose 1 Vote  
  - Move 1 Influence marker down 1  
  - Spend £2  
  - Sell 1 possession (value − £1, −£1 if from marked Borough)  
  - Gain 1 Megaphone  
  - Move 1 Influence marker diagonally down 1

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after any round if:  
- Any player’s score in any competition is ≤ 0, or  
- Round 5 ends.  

**Final Score Calculation**:  
- **Possessions**:  
  - Final score = Cash + (Possessions × (£value + £3))  
  - E.g., £5 cash + 2 possessions (values £2, £4) → 5 + (2+3) + (4+3) = 5+5+7 = **17**  
- **Election**:  
  - Final score = Number of Votes (can be negative)  
- **Society**:  
  - Final score = Sum of values under 4 Influence markers (can be negative)  

**Winning**:  
- Each player’s **final score** = their **highest** of the three competition scores.  
- **Lowest final score wins**.  
- Tiebreakers: compare second-highest scores, then third if needed.

  Only if the action explicitly allows diagonal movement.

  You must still choose another marker to move up.
