# Comprehensive Reference Manual: Cockroach Poker Royal

### 1. Lore & Objective
Players attempt to "palm off" unwanted cards onto others through bluffing and reading opponents. The goal is to avoid collecting too many cards in front of you. The first player to collect 4 of a kind (or 5 in a 2-player game) or run out of cards on their turn loses. All others win.

### 2. Components
- 56 animal cards (8 each of: bat, fly, cockroach, toad, rat, scorpion, stink bug)
- 7 royal cards (1 crowned version of each animal)
- 2 special cards:
  - **Joker Card**: Acts as any non-royal animal (never "Royal")
  - **Blank Card**: Always counts as a wrong claim, no matter the declared type
- Rulebook

Total: 65 cards

### 3. Setup
- Shuffle all 65 cards thoroughly.
- Create a penalty pile:
  - For 3–6 players: Place 7 cards face down; turn the top card face up.
  - For 2 players: Place 16 cards face down; turn the top card face up.
- Deal remaining cards equally among players.
- If cards remain after dealing:
  - The first player (youngest or designated) gets one extra card.
  - Any additional leftover cards are added to the penalty pile.
- Each player picks up their hand.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. The youngest player goes first.
2. On a turn, a player selects one card from their hand and passes it face down to another player.
3. Simultaneously, they make a claim: one of:
   - "Bat", "Fly", "Cockroach", "Toad", "Rat", "Scorpion", "Stink Bug", or "Royal"
4. The recipient has two choices:
   - **Show the card**
   - **Pass it on** (only if more than 2 players)

#### Option A: Show the Card
Before looking:
- Declare “right” (believes the claim) or “wrong” (does not believe).
- Reveal the card.
- Outcome:
  - If the caller was correct (e.g., said “wrong” and it wasn’t that animal/claim), the **original passer** takes the card and places it face up in front of them.
  - If the caller was incorrect, the **caller** takes the card and places it face up in front of them.
- The player who receives the card starts the next round.

#### Option B: Pass the Card On (3+ players only)
- Must declare intent to pass **before** secretly viewing the card.
- Slide the card face down to any other player who hasn’t seen it.
- Make a new claim (can repeat or change the previous one).
- That player now chooses to show or pass.
- Passing continues until only one player hasn't seen it — that player **must** show and judge.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Royal Cards
- Can be correctly claimed as either:
  - Its actual animal type (e.g., "Cockroach")
  - Or "Royal"
- When a player places a royal card face up in front of them:
  - They must also take the top card from the penalty pile and place it face up in front of them.
- Royal cards count toward sets of their animal type (e.g., a royal cockroach counts as a cockroach).
- After a royal card triggers a penalty draw, flip the new top card of the penalty pile face up.

#### Special Cards
- **Joker (All Animals Except Royal)**:
  - Any claim except "Royal" is correct.
  - If "Royal" is claimed, it's wrong.
- **Blank (Nothing Visible)**:
  - All claims are wrong, regardless of what is declared.
- If a player receives either special card:
  - They **do not** place it in front of them.
  - They add it to their hand.
  - Then must immediately:
    1. Place one card from their hand matching the last claim (e.g., if last claim was "Fly", play a fly), **or**
    2. If unable or unwilling, place **any two cards** from their hand face up in front of them.

#### Important Note:
Whenever a player places **any** card (including royal) face up in front of themselves (not via receiving a passed card), they must also draw and place the top penalty card — **but only for royal cards placed due to being received**. Clarification:
- Placing a royal card because you received it during a pass → take penalty card.
- Placing a royal card from your hand as part of punishment (two-card option) → **no** penalty card.
Only applies when you receive and place a royal card from a passed card.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends immediately when **any** of the following occurs:
- A player has **4 of the same animal type** (including royal versions) face up in front of them. → They lose.
- It is a player’s turn and they have **no cards in hand**. → They lose.

In both cases:
- That player loses.
- All other players win.

#### Two-Player Variant Rules:
- Penalty pile starts with **16 cards** (top card face up).
- Remaining cards dealt equally; first player gets one extra if needed.
- **No passing allowed** — recipient must always show and judge.
- Game ends when:
  - A player has **5 of the same animal type** in front of them, or
  - A player has no cards in hand on their turn.
- In both cases, that player loses; the other wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
**Q: Can I pass a card to someone who already saw it?**  
A: No. You must pass to a player who has not yet seen the card.

**Q: What happens if I receive a special card via a passed card?**  
A: You add it to your hand. Then you must either:
- Play a card matching the last claim, or
- Play any two cards from your hand.

**Q: Do I draw a penalty card every time I play a royal card?**  
A: No. Only when you **receive a royal card via passing** and place it in front of you. Playing one from your hand as part of a penalty does not trigger a draw.

**Q: Can I claim "Royal" on a non-royal card?**  
A: Yes, but it will always be wrong unless the card is actually royal.

**Q: Can I claim "Royal" on the blank or joker card?**  
- Joker: Claiming "Royal" is **wrong**.
- Blank: All claims are wrong anyway.

**Q: How are ties broken?**  
A: There are no ties. The game ends as soon as one player meets a losing condition.
