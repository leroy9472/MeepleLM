### 1. Lore & Objective
Polis: Fight for the Hegemony is set in 5th century B.C. Greece during the struggle for dominance between Athens and Sparta. Players expand influence through military conquest, diplomacy, trade, and cultural projects. Victory is achieved by accumulating the most victory points at the end of four rounds. Victory points are determined by:
- Total Population cubes across all controlled poleis
- Current Prestige
- "Prestige for Posterity" from completed projects

A player loses immediately if:
- They cannot supply their capital (Athens or Sparta) with sufficient wheat or Prestige
- Their Prestige reaches zero at the end of a round

### 2. Components
- Game board showing 12 land and 5 sea territories, 18 poleis, trade routes, tribute boxes, market value chart, round track
- 18 Polis Tiles (with base population, fortification, max growth, max population)

- 40 Event Cards (divided by round: 3, 4, 5α, 5β)
- 24 Combat Cards (for land and sea battles)
- Wooden components:
  - 45 red cubes (Sparta) and 45 blue cubes (Athens) for Population, Hoplites, Galleys

  - 8 red ships and 8 blue ships (Merchants)
  - 1 red pawn and 1 blue pawn (Proxenoi)

  - Athens: Polis tiles for Chios, Chalkis, Athenai; 3 hoplites in Attika; 2 hoplites in Ionia; 2 galleys in Kyklades; 1 galley in Noties Sporades; 1 merchant in Trade Port; Proxenos in Athenai

- Shuffle 4 separate decks of Event Cards (by round) and place face down.
- Shuffle Combat Card deck.
- Draw 3 Project Tiles and place face up on board spaces.
- Draw Event Card for Round 3 and apply effects (Athens first, then Sparta).
- Player with less Prestige begins (Sparta if tied).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds as follows:

**Action Phase:**
- Players alternate taking 2 different actions per turn.
- Actions are chosen from 12 types across three categories: Development, Military, Political.
- A player cannot repeat the same action in a single turn.
- After completing actions, check for battles (8+ total units in any territory).
- When a player passes (opts not to take 1 or 2 actions), their opponent may continue taking actions (even repeating the same action) at a cost of 1 additional resource per action.
- The round ends when both players pass.

**End of Round Phase (in order, player who passed first starts each phase):**
1. **Projects**: All projects complete. Controlling player gains immediate Prestige (non-bracketed value).
2. **Supply**: Pay wheat equal to total Population. Shortfall paid with Prestige (1:1) or by returning poleis to neutrality.
3. **Growth**: Optionally spend wheat (1:1) to increase Population, up to Maximum Growth and Maximum Population limits.
4. **Megalopolis**: Gain 1 Prestige for each polis exceeding its Base Population.
5. **Storage**: Lose half of stored wine, oil, and wheat (rounded up).
6. **Phoros**: Optionally spend Prestige (1:1) to gain silver.

**Preparation for Next Round:**
- Advance round marker.
- Return all tribute discs to owners.
- Return all merchants to Trade Ports.
- Remove unselected Project Tiles and draw 3 new ones.
- Draw and resolve Event Card for next round.
- Player with less Prestige begins next round (Sparta if tied).

### 5. Core Mechanics

**Development Actions:**
1. **Create Hoplites**: In one polis per turn. Pay 1 metal/silver per hoplite. Move 1 Population cube to adjacent land territory. Cannot reduce polis to 0 Population. Cannot create in Epidamnos or Abdera.
2. **Create Galleys**: In one polis per turn. Pay 1 wood/silver per galley. Move 1 Population cube to adjacent sea territory (per arrow). Cannot reduce to 0 Population. Not possible in Sparta or Thebai.
3. **Create Merchants**: In one commercial city (Athens, Pylos, Gytheion) per turn. Pay 1 wood/silver per merchant. Remove 1 Population cube and place merchant in Trade Port. Cannot reduce to 0 Population.
4. **Begin Project**: In one polis per turn. Pay resources (silver can fully substitute any resource type). Place Project Tile on polis. Only one project per polis at a time. Completes at end of round.

**Military Actions (each costs 1 Prestige):**
5. **Move Hoplites**: Move any number of hoplites from different territories to one destination territory. Move one at a time. Cannot mix land and sea movement in same action. Cannot cross enemy-controlled territories. Cannot move through land territories at capacity (optional: cannot move through any territory at capacity). Chalkis, Chios, Korkyra are part of land for movement.
6. **Move Galleys**: Move any number of galleys from different sea territories to one destination sea territory. Move one at a time. Cannot cross enemy-controlled sea territories. Cannot move through sea territories at capacity (optional rule).
7. **Besiege Polis**: Must control territory and have ≥ Fortification value in hoplites. Roll d4: success on roll ≥ Fortification. Success: gain polis tile, projects, Prestige = Fortification, replace population. Failure: lose 1 hoplite; if enemy polis, it loses 1 Population cube. Cannot besiege Athens, Sparta, Epidamnos, Abdera. Korinthos and Syrakousai cannot be besieged in Round 3.
8. **Collection**: In territory with owned polis and hoplites. Place hoplites in Tribute Box rows to collect resources (value = rightmost space). Place disc to block reuse. No Prestige cost in home territory (Attika/Lakedaimon). Achaia can be collected by first player with hoplites there.

**Political Actions:**
9. **Trade**: Move one merchant via free trade route (no enemy galleys in sea territories) to Foreign Market. Place on available shipload. Options:
   - Exchange goods for wheat/silver (cost based on market value chart)
   - Purchase wheat with silver (1:1)
   After trade: if goods exchanged, move resource marker right (die roll); if wheat purchased, move marker left (higher of two die rolls).
10. **Move Proxenos**: Move from one polis to another via land or sea. Not blocked by enemy control. Pay 1 silver per enemy unit crossed. Cannot have two Proxenoi in same polis. Cannot use diolkos unless controlling Korinthos.
11. **Release Proxenos**: Pay 2 silver to opponent to free captured Proxenos. Place in capital.
12. **Instigate Civil War**: Proxenos must be in neutral or enemy polis. Cost: 2× Base Population (neutral) or 3× Current Population (enemy). Gain polis, projects, Prestige = Population bribed. Cannot target enemy capital.

**Battles:**
- Triggered when ≥8 total units (both players) in a territory after a player's turn.
- Resolve after both players pass if triggered during final actions.
- Combat Cards: Each player dealt cards = number of units in battle.
- Land battles: Sparta attacks first. Sea battles: Athens attacks first.
- Each round: Attacker plays 2 cards, defender plays 2 cards to match formations.
- Results:
  - Formation mismatch: Defender loses 1 unit, attacker gains Prestige on card.
  - Formation match: No loss; attacker gains difference in Prestige values if positive.
- Special Cards:
  - **Mercenaries**: Defender plays = automatic formation match (except vs Salpinx). Attacker plays = no casualties.
  - **Salpinx Call**: Always causes defender loss, but attacker pays 1 Prestige. Cannot be matched.
- After round: Discard cards. Attacker draws 2, defender draws 2 minus losses. Roles switch.
- Battle ends if:
  - Insufficient cards remain
  - One player retreats (pay 1 Prestige)
  - Defender has <2 units
- Retreat possible before first round.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends immediately if:
- A player cannot supply their capital
- A player has 0 Prestige at end of round

Otherwise, game ends after Round 4 (5β). Final score:
- Sum of all Population cubes in controlled poleis
- Current Prestige
- Sum of "Prestige for Posterity" (bracketed values) from all projects in controlled poleis

Tiebreaker: Player with more total resources (metal, wood, wine, oil, silver, wheat).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Movement Order**: Hoplites move one at a time; order matters as control can shift during movement.
- **Capacity Limits**: Round number sets max units per player per territory (land/sea). Applies to movement and presence.
- **Proxenos Capture**: If polis is besieged and Proxenos is present, it is captured. Must be ransomed (2 silver) to return.
- **Project Completion**: Projects complete at end of round regardless of polis ownership changes during round.
- **Resource Substitution**: Silver can fully replace any resource type in projects or unit creation, but not partially.
- **Rounding**: Always round up (e.g., Phidias Prestige, event effects like "half").
- **Component Limits**: All game components are limited. Cannot perform actions requiring unavailable pieces.
- **Trade Routes**: Athens must cross Kyklades first. Sparta chooses between Ionio or Myrtöo Pelagos. Korinthos owner can move directly between them.
- **Event Cards**: Effects apply only in the round drawn unless specified. "Mercenaries" and "Pacifism" allow combining actions.
