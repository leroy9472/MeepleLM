## Dream Home — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Dream Home*, players design and build their ideal house over 12 rounds by selecting room and resource cards. The goal is to maximize your score through strategic room placement, decoration, home functionality, and roof composition. The player with the highest total score wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most children depicted in their room artwork wins.

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player takes a home board and reference tile.  
2. Place the game board in the center.  
3. **Resource Cards**: Shuffle and place the deck face-down on space A. Draw 4 cards and place face-up on the 4 rightmost top-row spaces. *Leftmost top space remains empty (first-player space)*.  
4. **Room Cards**: Shuffle and place the deck face-down on space B. Draw 5 cards and place face-up on the 5 bottom-row spaces.  
5. Place décor tokens near the board.  
6. Youngest player takes the first player marker.

> **For 2–3 players**: At the start of each round, the first player discards one full column (room + resource) before taking their turn. Cannot discard the leftmost column.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **12 rounds**. Each round:

1. **Choose Column**: Starting with the first player (clockwise), each player selects a column and takes:
   - The room card (bottom)
   - The resource card (top)
   - If the **leftmost column** is chosen, also take the **first player marker**. If no one picks it, the current first player keeps it.

2. **Place Cards**:
   - **Room Card**: Immediately place it on your home board (see *Placing Room Cards* below). If you cannot or choose not to place it legally, place it **face-down** on an empty space → becomes an **empty room (0 points)**.
   - **Resource Card**: Resolve immediately based on type (see *Core Mechanics*).

3. **Discard Unused Cards**: After all players have taken a turn, discard any remaining cards on the board.

4. **Refill Board**:
   - Draw 4 new resource cards → top row (rightmost 4 spaces)
   - Draw 5 new room cards → bottom row
   - Decks may run out in later rounds; only refill available cards.

Repeat for 12 rounds. After Round 12, proceed to **Scoring**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Room Types  
- **Normal Rooms** (e.g., Bedroom, Kitchen): Placed on upper two floors. Score based on size (1, 2, or 3 cards).  
- **Unique Rooms** (e.g., Playroom, Sauna): Same placement rules. May have special scoring.  
- **Basement Rooms** (dark border, name/points at top): Only on the two bottom basement spaces.

#### Resource Cards  
- **Roof Cards**:
  - Place face-down on your roof stack.
  - Cannot look at them until endgame.
  - Used in final roof scoring (choose 4 best cards).
- **Décor Cards**:
  - Place matching décor token on a room of correct type.
  - Room must not already have a décor token.
  - If no valid room, discard the card.
  - Placing a décor token **finishes** the room (cannot expand further), **unless** you have the **Interior Designer** helper.
- **Tool Cards** (used during game):
  - **Drill**: Before choosing column, swap a room card on the board with one on your board (legal placement required).
  - **Jackhammer**: Before round starts, take any room card from board (place it); discard its resource. Skip your turn.
  - **Concrete Mixer**: Before choosing column, swap two room cards on the board.
  - **Scaffolding**: Place on an empty basement space. Allows room above even if no real basement room. Must be replaced by a room (or empty room) before game ends.
- **Helper Cards** (used at endgame, except Interior Designer):
  - **Roofer**: Add one discarded roof card to your stack before choosing 4.
  - **Supplier**: Swap one discarded room card with any room on your board (must follow placement rules).
  - **Architect**: Score +1 per empty room; +1 to both home functionality bonuses.
  - **Handyman**: Swap positions of any two room cards on your board (must follow rules). Décor tokens move with rooms.
  - **Interior Designer**:
    - During game: Placing décor does **not** finish the room.
    - Rooms previously finished by décor can now be expanded (unless at size limit).
    - At endgame: Each décor token scores +1 point.

#### Placing Room Cards  
- **Vertical Rule**: A room card cannot be placed above an **empty space** (must have a room or Scaffolding below).
- **Basement Rule**: Basement rooms only on the two designated basement spaces.
- **Expansion**:
  - Rooms expand **horizontally** only.
  - Max size shown by icons: □ (1), □□ (2), □□□ (3).
  - Cannot exceed maximum size.
  - If you try to expand beyond limit → place card **face-down** as **empty room**.
- **Finished Rooms**:
  - A room is finished if:
    - It has reached its size limit, **or**
    - It has a décor token (unless you have **Interior Designer**).
  - A finished room **cannot be expanded**.
  - You **cannot place** a room of the same type adjacent to a finished room of that type → must place face-down as empty room.
- **Empty Rooms**:
  - Created when a room is placed illegally or cannot be placed legally.
  - Worth 0 points.
  - Cannot be expanded.
  - Can be adjacent to other rooms or empty rooms.

#### Special Rules  
- **Adjacent Rooms**: Only horizontal adjacency counts for expansion.
- **Vertical Rooms**: Rooms above each other are on different floors → not connected.
- **Identical Rooms**: Cannot be adjacent unless expanding the same room.
- **Décor Placement**: Must match room type (color-coded). Exceptions: Bird House, Tree House, Cat House (special décor; placed near board, not on room).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After 12 rounds, score:

#### Rooms  
- Score based on **number of cards** in a horizontally connected room.
- Use the **point value** shown for that size on the card.
  - Example: 2-card bedroom = 4 pts; 3-card living room = 9 pts.
  - 1-card garage = 0 pts; 2-card garage = 4 pts.
- **Pantry / Dressing Room / Sauna**:  
  - +3 pts if adjacent to Kitchen / Bedroom / Bathroom respectively.  
  - +1 pt otherwise.

#### Décor  
- Sum point values of all décor tokens used.
- **Interior Designer**: +1 pt per décor token.

#### Home Functionality  
- +3 pts if you have a **bathroom on both 1st and 2nd floors**.
- +3 pts if you have **at least one kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom**.
- **Architect Helper**: +1 to each of these bonuses (total +4 each).

#### Roof  
- Reveal all roof cards. Choose **4** to form your roof.
- Scoring:
  - **Uniform Roof** (4 same color): **8 pts**
  - **Mismatched Roof** (not all same): **3 pts**
  - **Incomplete** (<4 cards): **0 pts**
- **Windows**: +1 pt per window on the 4 chosen cards (1 window per roof type).
- **Roofer Helper**: May add one discarded roof card to your stack before choosing 4.

> **Max Roof Score**: 8 (uniform) + 1 (window) = **9 pts**

#### Final Score  
Sum:
- Room points
- Décor points (+ Interior Designer bonus)
- Home functionality (+ Architect bonus)
- Roof points

**Winner**: Highest total.  
**Tiebreaker**: Player with the most **children** visible in room artwork wins.  
**Still tied?**: Players share victory.
