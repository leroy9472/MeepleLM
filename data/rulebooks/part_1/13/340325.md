### 1. Lore & Objective
Vagrantsong is a cooperative narrative-driven game set on a haunted train. Players take on the roles of Vagrants—wanderers with unique skills—attempting to save tormented spirits known as Haints. The ultimate goal is to resolve each Scenario by meeting its specific victory conditions, typically by helping a Haint regain its lost Humanity and break free from the train. Victory is collaborative, and players are encouraged to embrace hardship and shared storytelling through "The Hobo Code."

### 3. Setup
1. Assemble the train board, divided into three train car sections (A, B, C) and connecting spaces.
2. Each player chooses a Vagrant and takes:
   - Their Vagrant Card
   - 3 Coins
   - Standee(s)
   - 2 Starting Skills
3. Place all 27 Rummage Tokens into the Bindle and shake.
4. Shuffle Tier I Junk Cards to form the Junk Deck (special Junk Cards are not included initially).
5. Follow the Scenario-specific setup instructions:
   - Place Haint(s) as directed
   - Set Haint Mood Token to the top mood
   - Place any initial tokens or terrain
6. If required, draw and resolve an Event.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- **Rounds & Turns**: A Scenario consists of multiple Rounds. Each Round follows this order:
  1. Players choose which Vagrant takes the first turn.
  2. Alternating Vagrant and Haint turns proceed until all characters have acted.
  3. Advance the Round Marker. On reaching space 6, it resets to 1.
- The Scenario ends when:
  - Victory conditions are met, OR
  - All Vagrants become Westbound (defeat)

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Vagrant Turn
1. **Reclaim Coins**: Take back all Coins from previous actions.
2. **Assign Coins**: Place all 3 Coins (or fewer if restricted) on:
   - General Actions (Move, Rummage, Investigate, Patch Up, Bust)
   - Skill or Junk Cards (only if the card had 0 Coins on it in the previous Round)
3. **Perform Actions** (in any order):
   - **Move**: Each Coin allows movement up to the Vagrant’s Move value (orthogonal only). Cannot end on occupied or terrain spaces. Moving through a Haint causes Haunting.
   - **Rummage**: Draw 1 Token per Coin spent. Keep 1, return others to Bindle. Max Tokens held = Rummage value on Vagrant Card.
   - **Investigate**: Must be on same space as Event Token. Roll Bones equal to Coins spent. Successes = rolls ≥ Vagrant’s Investigate value. Resolve Event text based on success count.
   - **Patch Up**: Roll Bones = Coins spent. Each success recovers 1 Humanity (up to max).
   - **Bust**: Roll Bones = Coins spent. Each success grants 1 Humanity to an adjacent Haint.
   - **Skill/Junk Actions**: Follow card text. Must meet range and conditions.

#### Haint Turn
1. **Draw Rummage Token**: The Vagrant who just acted draws a Token from the Bindle.
2. **Determine Action**: Based on Haint’s current Mood, use the action linked to the drawn Token.
3. **Target Priority** (in order):
   - Special Priority Token holder
   - Action-specific target
   - Closest Candle (same car, only if action has Move value)
   - Hurt Vagrant (most Humanity lost, same car, not Westbound)
   - Nearby Vagrant (closest, any car, not Westbound)
   - Westbound Vagrant
   - Recent Vagrant (last to act)
4. **Move Haint**:
   - Move orthogonally up to Move value.
   - Must end within action range of target if possible.
   - Will go out of its way to pass through Vagrants to Haunt them.
   - Cannot end on occupied space; if so, target is moved to adjacent open space.
5. **Resolve Action**: Apply effects. If target is out of range, use next valid target.
6. **Cycle Token**: Place drawn Rummage Token on Cycle Track.

#### Targeting & Range
- Range is measured in orthogonal spaces from actor to target.
- Characters can draw line of sight through other characters.
- Vagrants cannot draw range through Terrain.
- Haints can draw range through Terrain.

#### Bones (Dice) Mechanics
- Roll required number of Bones for action.
- Success if roll ≥ action’s Success Value.
- **Booming Boxcars**: Natural 6 triggers an extra die. Repeat for additional 6s.

#### Humanity & Wounds
- Vagrants have a max Humanity (solid heart on card).
- Losing Humanity: Move token down. At 0, suffer a Wound:
  - Flip any one Skill or Junk Card (becomes Wounded/Broken).
  - Humanity resets to max.
- Wounds prevent use of flipped cards.

#### Westbound
- Triggered when all Skills and Junk are Wounded/Broken.
- Effects:
  - Flip Vagrant Card to Westbound side.
  - Humanity set to 1 (cannot lose Humanity at 1).
  - Discard all Haint Effects.
  - Place Westbound Action Card over one Skill.
  - Can only use General Actions, Rummage Tokens, Passives, and Westbound Action.
- Recovery: When Humanity reaches max, flip Vagrant Card back, flip one Wounded card, remove Westbound Action.

#### Haint Humanity & Breaking
- Haints gain Humanity via Bust or Iron Nails.
- When Humanity reaches Threshold, Haint Breaks:
  - Lower Break Track by 1.
  - Reset Haint Humanity to 0.
  - Next Haint turn is skipped; all Vagrants gain 1 Humanity.
- If Break Track reaches 0, Haint is saved (usually victory).

#### Cycle Effect
- When a Rummage Token type reaches its Cycle value on the Cycle Track:
  - Resolve Cycle Effect (end of current turn).
  - Return all Tokens to Bindle and shuffle.

#### Rummage Tokens
- **Iron Nails**: Target Haint within Range 2 → +2 Humanity.
- **Candle**: Place in adjacent space. Makes Haint prioritize it. Removed when Haint moves onto it.
- **Salt**: Ignore effects of a Haint action targeting the user (not movement or Haunted effects).
- **Rabbit’s Foot**: Use as a 4th Coin. Discard after use.
- **Apple**: Flip one Wounded Skill face-up.

#### Trading & Using Tokens
- Can trade or give Rummage Tokens to adjacent Vagrants during turn.
- Doing so counts as "using" the Token for the Round.
- Only 1 Rummage Token may be used per Vagrant per Round.
- Tokens used during Haint’s Turn resolve after the Haint’s action.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Winning**: Meet Scenario-specific victory conditions (often saving the Haint).
  - At Camp Phase, read Victory Moment.
- **Losing**: All Vagrants become Westbound OR Scenario-specific defeat condition.
  - Read Defeat Moment at Camp Phase.
- **Rituals**: Complete objectives for powerful rewards (coins, effects).
- **Mile Posts**: Track progress. Unlock long-term benefits when thresholds reached.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Ties in Priority**: Use Hobo Code—choose worst outcome for Vagrants. If still tied, roll Bones.
- **Multiple Valid Paths**: Haint chooses path that haunts most Vagrants. If equal, apply Hobo Code.
- **No Rummage Tokens in Bindle**: Immediately cycle all Tokens (resolve Cycle Effect), then draw.
- **Event Tokens Drawn**:
  - During Vagrant turn: Resolve immediately, then draw replacement.
  - During Haint turn: Resolve on drawing Vagrant, draw replacement for action.
- **Westbound Action Use**: Can be used every turn, not limited by Coin or previous use.
- **Haint Break During Own Turn**: Continue action, then apply Break effects after.
- **Rule Conflicts**: Order of precedence:
  1. Event
  2. Card (Skill, Junk, In-Between)
  3. Scenario
  4. Rulebook
- **Component Reuse**: Tokens may be repurposed per Scenario rules—always read Scenario text.
