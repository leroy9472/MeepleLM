## Animal Upon Animal Deluxe – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The animals are teaming up to build towering pyramids in a test of balance and skill. In **Game 1: High, Higher, Hurray!**, two pyramids grow on a wobbly seesaw supported by two crocodiles. In **Game 2: The Original**, all players build a single pyramid starting from one central crocodile.  

**Objective:** Be the first player to successfully stack all animals from your personal stockpile onto the pyramid(s). The first player with no animals remaining wins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Game 1 – Silver Die Symbols  
- **1 green dot**: Place 1 animal on the green crocodile side (or on top of the current stack).  
- **2 green dots**: Place 2 animals on the green crocodile side, one after the other.  
- **1 orange dot**: Place 1 animal on the orange crocodile side.  
- **2 orange dots**: Place 2 animals on the orange crocodile side, one after the other.  
- **Question mark (?)**: Other players choose which animal you must stack and on which crocodile side.  
- **Star**: Choose any animal and place it on **either side** of the seesaw.  

#### Game 2 – Red Die Symbols  
- **1 dot**: Place 1 animal anywhere on the pyramid.  
- **2 dots**: Place 2 animals one after the other on the pyramid.  
- **Hand**: Choose an animal and give it to another player; they must stack it for you.  
- **Question mark (?)**: Other players choose which animal you must stack.  
- **Crocodile**: Place an animal **next to** the base crocodile (touching at head or tail), expanding the base. Other animals may later be stacked on top of this new base animal.  

#### Stacking Rules (Both Games)  
- Use **only one hand** to stack.  
- Stacked animals **must not touch the table** (exception: Game 2, when placing a base animal via the crocodile symbol).  
- Animals **cannot lie flat on their side**; they may be rotated but must remain upright.  
- Animals must be stacked **on other animals**, not directly on the seesaw (except base animals in Game 2).  
- In Game 1, animals on one side **must not touch** the pyramid on the other side during placement.  
- If the seesaw tilts and animals touch across sides, this is allowed — but the placement rule still applies at time of stacking.

#### Collapse Rules  
- If animals fall **during your turn**, your turn ends immediately.  
- **1–2 animals fall**: You must return them to your stockpile.  
- **More than 2 animals fall**: Return two to your stockpile; the rest go back to the box.  
- **Full collapse (including crocodile/seesaw)**: Rebuild the starting position. You take **2 animals** into your stockpile. Any animals in your hand also return to your stockpile.  
- **Animals fall without player action** (e.g., due to instability): Return them to the box.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends **immediately** when a player has **no animals left in their stockpile at the end of their turn**.  
- That player **wins** and is crowned the Animal Stacking Champion.  
- No points are tallied; it’s a race to empty your stockpile first.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place an animal that touches both pyramids in Game 1?**  
  No. During placement, the animal must not touch the opposite pyramid. If the seesaw tilts afterward and contact occurs, it’s acceptable.  

- **What if I roll the hand and give an animal to someone who drops it?**  
  The player who physically stacks (or drops) the animal is responsible for the collapse. They suffer the penalty (adding animals to stockpile).  

- **Can I stack on a base animal placed via the crocodile symbol in Game 2?**  
  Yes. Once an animal is placed next to the crocodile, it becomes part of the base and can support further animals.  

- **What happens if only one animal falls during a collapse?**  
  You return that single animal to your stockpile.  

- **Can I roll the die if I only have one animal left?**  
  In standard rules: yes.  
  In **expert variation**: no — you must place your last animal immediately without rolling.  

- **Fewer than 4 players — what to do with leftover animals?**  
  In standard rules: return them to the box.  
  In **expert variation**: distribute remaining animals evenly among players.
