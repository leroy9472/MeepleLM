## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
The game simulates the rise and fall of civilizations across Europe from prehistoric times to the High Middle Ages. Players guide their civilizations through expansion and eventual decline, scoring victory points (VP) by controlling provinces and leveraging unique abilities. The goal is to be the first to reach the target VP based on player count (150 for 3 players, 120 for 4, 100 for 5–6), with the game ending after all players complete an equal number of turns.

2. **Components**  
- Game board of Europe with provinces (Farmland, Forest, Mountain, Prairie, Coast, Sea)  
- 150 wooden population tokens in 6 colors  
- 6 large scoring tokens  
- 33 brown neutral tokens (used for initial inhabitants and forts)  
- 52 decline counters (small markers for declining empires)  
- 52 civilization tiles (with abilities)  
- 1 cloth bag for drawing tiles  
- 6 player aid charts  
- Rulebook and reference sheets  

3. **Setup**  
1. Each player chooses a color and places their scoring token on 10 on the victory point (VP) track.  
2. Place one brown neutral token in every non-mountain province. Sea regions remain empty.  
3. Draw 6 pairs of civilization tiles from the bag and place them in order from I to VI at the top of the board.  
4. Determine starting player randomly.  
5. In turn order, each player chooses a civilization (see Declining Turn, Phase 5).  

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Each turn, a player chooses one of two actions:  
- **Expansion Turn**: Expand the active empire.  
- **Declining Turn**: End the current empire’s reign and prepare a new one.

**Expansion Turn Phases**:  
1. **Collect Tokens or Choose Starting Province**  
   - If the player has an active empire: collect all tokens from their provinces, leaving one behind in each to retain control.  
   - If starting a new civilization: use all starting tokens to expand from a valid starting province.  
2. **Expand the Empire**  
   - Conquer adjacent provinces using tokens.  
   - Cost = 2 + 1 per forest/mountain + 1 per defender token – 1 if attacking from a mountain.  
   - Apply modifiers from civilization tiles (minimum cost: 0).  
   - Newly conquered provinces can be used as bases for further expansion.  
3. **Reorganize Tokens**  
   - Freely redistribute all tokens among controlled provinces.  
   - Must maintain at least one token in each province if possible.  
   - Ensure empire is cohesive (all provinces connected). If not, abandon disconnected provinces.  
4. **Score Victory Points**  
   - Score 1 VP per province (mountains = 0 VP unless modified).  
   - Include VP from declining empire (if any).  
   - Apply VP modifiers from active and declining civilization tiles.

**Declining Turn Phases**:  
1. Remove all tokens and decline counters from any prior declining empire.  
2. Remove all but one token per province from the current empire.  
3. Place a decline counter in each province of the empire now in decline.  
4. Return both civilization tiles to the bag (except yellow tiles with broken column symbol).  
5. Score VP for the now-declining empire (only broken-column yellow tiles apply).  
6. Choose a new civilization (see below).  

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Civilization Tiles**: Each civilization has two abilities from three categories:  
  - **Yellow (VP Bonuses)**:  
    - Agriculture: +1 VP in Farmland  
    - Livestock Breeding: +1 VP in Prairie  
    - Mining: +2 VP in Mining provinces  
    - Port Building: +1 VP in Harbor provinces  
    - Currency: +1 VP per province (including mountains)  
    - Slavery: +1 VP per enemy/neutral token eliminated (not forts)  
    - *Tiles with broken column symbol remain active during decline.*  
  - **Pink (Combat Advantages)**:  
    - Espionage: One conquest per turn costs exactly 2 tokens (ignores modifiers)  
    - Field General: Gain 7 tokens at start of turn, lose 7 before scoring VP  
    - Militia: Enemy conquests of your provinces cost +1 token  
    - Weapons: All conquests cost –1 token  
    - Fortification: Place one fort per turn; fort costs +1 to conquer, attacks from it cost –1  
  - **Blue (Special Abilities)**:  
    - Astronomy: Expand across sea regions; sea-connected provinces are adjacent for cohesion  
    - Medicine: Gain 1 extra token at start of each turn  
    - Messages (Messengers): Ignore cohesion rule  
    - Diplomacy: Choose one opponent; neither may attack the other until your next turn  
    - Barbarians: No special abilities  
    - Specialization: Count as two of the same tile; starting tokens = 2× other tile +1 + player bonus  
    - Rebirth: Declare decline at end of turn (after scoring) instead of beginning  
    - Heritage: Active empire may expand into provinces adjacent to own declining empire  
    - Revolutionaries: May start in any province (not just edge)  

- **Modifiers are cumulative**, but conquest cost cannot go below 0.  
- **Starting a Civilization**: Must begin on edge province or one reachable by crossing one sea region. Revolutionaries may start anywhere.  
- **Cohesion Rule**: Active empires must be contiguous. Checked after reorganization. Declining empires need not be cohesive.  
- **Declining Empire Rules**:  
  - Only one declining empire per player.  
  - Active and declining empires cannot be adjacent. If they become adjacent, declining provinces are cleared.  
  - Broken-column yellow tiles (Agriculture, Livestock Breeding, Mining, Port Building) continue to score VP during decline.  

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- Score VP at the end of every turn.  
- VP Sources:  
  - 1 VP per province (mountains = 0 unless modified)  
  - VP from civilization tiles (active and applicable declining)  
  - Slavery: +1 VP per eliminated token (not forts)  
- Game ends when a player reaches the target VP:  
  - 3 players: 150  
  - 4 players: 120  
  - 5–6 players: 100  
- After a player reaches the target, all players complete the current round. The player with the most VP wins.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Zero-cost conquests**: Allowed. No token is placed, but at least one token must be present after reorganization to retain control.  
- **Lost all provinces?** Empire can be preserved or put into decline. If declined, player is off the board for one turn.  
- **Choosing civilizations**:  
  - Choosing civilization I: free  
  - Choosing II: pay 2 VP  
  - Choosing III: pay 4 VP, etc. (2 VP per step)  
  - Each passed-over civilization gets a token (worth 2 VP when chosen later)  
  - After selection, shift remaining pairs left and draw two new tiles for space VI  
- **Starting tokens**: Sum of red numbers on two civilization tiles + bonus based on player count:  
  - 3 players: +6  
  - 4 players: +5  
  - 5 players: +4  
  - 6 players: +3  
  - Specialization: 2× other tile +1 + player bonus  
  - Medicine: +1 token per turn  
- **Forts**:  
  - Placed at end of turn in active empire provinces  
  - Cost +1 to conquer, attacks from it cost –1  
  - Survive during decline but cannot be added  
  - Removed if province is conquered or abandoned
