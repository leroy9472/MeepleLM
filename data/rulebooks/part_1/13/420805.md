## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Black Forest*, players take on the roles of settlers in the historic Black Forest region, beginning with a modest Glass Hut. Inspired by real historical practices, glassmakers relocated frequently due to high wood consumption, leaving behind structures that evolved into farming estates. Players expand their domains by hiring tradespeople, constructing buildings, breeding livestock, and producing glass. The goal is to score the most points through buildings, livestock, and domain development.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, choose:
- **Standard Turn** (in order):
  1. Spend 1 Commodity (optional)
  2. Movement (required)
  3. Action (required)
- **Begging** (if you can’t move or choose to)

#### 1. Spend 1 Commodity (Optional)
- Spend exactly 1 commodity to swap the Traveling Merchant with any other tradesperson.
- Cannot spend more than 1 per turn.
- **2-player only**: After swap, move neutral pawn to any empty village space.

#### 2. Movement
You must move unless you Beg.
- **Same village**: Move to another empty space between two tradespeople. No cost.
- **To another village**: Pay 1 provision per path (cheapest route). Pay 1 basic resource (of your choice) to each player already in the destination village.
  - **2-player only**: Pay 1 resource if neutral pawn is in the village.
- **To a Location Job**: Pay travel cost. You must complete the job as your action. Cannot move here unless you can complete it.

**First Turn Only**: Place your pawn in any empty space (no cost).

#### 3. Action
Choose one:
- **Visit 1 or 2 adjacent Tradespeople** (in order of choice)
- **Complete 1 Job** (if available)

##### Visit Tradespeople
Each tradesperson offers:
- A fixed reward (e.g., Cattle Farmer → 1 cattle)
- A conditional reward (e.g., Herder → 1 porridge per cattle)
- A cost → reward (e.g., Brickmaker: spend 1 charcoal → gain 4 brick)
- Some allow removing a Forest for resources or construction (e.g., Woodworker)

If visiting two, complete one fully, then the other.

##### Complete a Job
- **Village Job**: Can be completed from any space in the village.
- **Location Job**: Must travel to it and complete as action.
- Pay cost (red background), gain reward.
- Discard job next to your tableau.
- Reveal next job:
  - Location Job → place on matching board space.
  - Tradesperson Job → place on matching village; if full, place in next clockwise village without a job.
- Max active jobs: 3 (4 in 4-player game).

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Production Tableau
- Two wheels:
  - **Left**: Glassmaking Wheel (sand, water, wood, charcoal, glass)
  - **Right**: Cooking Wheel (porridge, meat, charcoal, provisions, commodities)
- Brick tracked separately on left.
- **Basic Resources**: Markers in large sections (move clockwise to gain).
- **Refined Resources**: Markers in small sections (move counterclockwise to gain).

#### Gaining & Spending Resources
- **Basic Resources**: Gain → clockwise; Spend → counterclockwise.
- **Refined Resources**: Gain → counterclockwise; Spend → clockwise.
- Max: 7 for basic, 3 for refined.
- Never go below 0.

#### Charcoal & Provisions
- Two markers each.
- **Gaining**: Choose one wheel (cannot split).
- **Spending**: Can split between wheels.
- **Provisions**: Can split gain/spend since both on same wheel.

#### Producing Refined Resources
- Trigger when both dark-marked spaces on a wheel are empty:
  - Large section “0” space
  - Small section “3” space
- Turn dial clockwise until at least one marked space is filled.
- This consumes basic resources to produce:
  - Glass (from sand, water, wood, charcoal)
  - Provisions (from porridge, meat, charcoal)
  - Commodities (from porridge, meat, charcoal)
- Must produce immediately if condition met.
- If gaining multiple resources triggers production, produce before continuing.

#### Rewards
- Must take all rewards; cannot forfeit.
- May choose order of multi-part rewards.
- If production triggers mid-reward, produce before next part.
- Excess resources beyond max are lost.
- Landscape tiles/Forests not placed (no space) are lost.

#### Domain & Estates
- **Domain** = Main Estate + all Small Estates + contents.
- **Main Estate**: Starting board.
- **Small Estate**: Gained when Glass Hut relocates.
- Each Estate is a separate board.

#### Glass Hut Progress
- Gain steps (e.g., from Carpenter or Furnace Maker).
- When tracker reaches top, relocate:
  - Take 1 Small Estate, attach to right of Domain.
  - Place 2 Forests on marked spaces.
  - Move Glass Hut to stable on new Estate.
  - Reset Progress Tracker to bottom.
  - Apply remaining steps.
- Each relocation frees the previous stable for use.

#### Constructing Buildings
- Choose any building you can afford.
- Pay cost (glass: 0–3 depending on size).
- Place on empty space (no Field, Pond, Pasture, Building, or stable).
- **Small Buildings**: 0, 1, or 2 glass (sorted by column).
- **Large Buildings**: All cost 3 glass.
- Gain instant reward if present.

##### Building Effects
- **Conversion (Blue)**: Use anytime (except during cost payment). Pay cost → gain reward. Can use multiple times.
- **Instant (Beige)**: One-time reward on construction.
- **Permanent (Red)**: Ongoing effect (e.g., “each time…”).
- **End Game Points (Yellow)**: Scores bonus points at game end (in addition to printed star value).

#### Housing Livestock
- **Pasture**: Up to 3 pigs or 3 cattle.
- **Stable**: Up to 2 cattle (no pigs).
- **Forest**: Up to 1 pig (no cattle).
- Can relocate livestock anytime.
- Cannot gain livestock if no housing; return excess if housing lost.

#### Anytime Actions
May be used at any time (even during others’ turns), except:
- Cannot use during a tradesperson visit (but can between two visits).
Available actions:
- Use blue Building conversion.
- Relocate livestock.
- Remove Landscape tiles (Fields, Ponds, Pastures) to free space. Cannot remove Forests or Buildings.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### End Game Trigger
- Game ends at the end of a turn if **one or both provision markers** on Cooking wheel have reached or passed the end-of-game symbol.
- Player must announce this.
- Each player (including triggerer) takes **one final turn**.

#### Scoring
Flip over Buildings board to reveal scoring track. Place pawns at 0.
Score:
- **1 point per glass**
- **Points from Cooking Wheel**: Value pointed to by large hand of dial
- **2 points per Small Estate**
- **1 point per Livestock on a Pasture** (only those on Pastures score)
- **Points from Buildings**: Star value on each Building
- **Bonus Points**: From “End of Game Points” Building effects (e.g., Village Church: 1 pt per adjacent empty space)

#### Winning
- Highest score wins.
- Tiebreak:
  1. If one tied player triggered end game → they win.
  2. Else: tied player who would go next wins.
