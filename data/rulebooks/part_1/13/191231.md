## Via Nebula — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
For centuries, the land of Via Nebula has lain in ruin, shrouded in fog and overrun by monsters. Brave explorers now venture into the mist to reclaim the land, exploit resources, and rebuild civilization. Players act as guild leaders seeking to expand their influence by exploring terrain, gathering resources, fulfilling contracts, and erecting buildings. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VP) by the end of the game.

### 2. Components  
- Game board (two sides: beginner and expert)  
- 90 Resource tokens (Wood, Food, Stone, Clay, Wheat)  
- 8 Private Contract cards (purple)  
- 33 Neutral Contract cards (gold)  
- 25 Exploitation tokens (20 regular, 5 special)  
- 4 Player colors: Blue, Brown, White, Black  
- Each player receives:  
  - 1 Guild Board (sided for 2P or 3–4P)  
  - 5 Buildings  
  - 3 Building Sites (half-hex tiles; full-hex in 2P)  
  - 2 Craftsmen (3 in 2P)  
  - Meadow Tiles:  
    - 4 players: 12 tiles (4 stacks of 3)  
    - 3 players: 16 tiles (4 stacks of 4)  
    - 2 players: 20 tiles (4 stacks of 5)  
- End-of-Game Card  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Board Placement**: Place board in center. Choose side (beginner or expert).  
2. **Resources**: Place all 5 resource types in supply piles next to board.  
3. **Contracts**:  
   - Shuffle 8 Private Contracts; deal 2 to each player (return extras to box in 2P/3P).  
   - Shuffle 33 Neutral Contracts; place face-down stack on board. Reveal top 4.  
   - Place End-of-Game Card on designated spot.  
4. **Exploitation Tokens**:  
   - Randomly remove 1 of the 5 Special Exploitation tokens (no VP on front); return to box.  
   - Shuffle remaining 24 exploitation tokens face-down and place one on each meadow space.  
   - Flip all face-up.  
   - Replace each of the 4 Special Exploitation tokens with indicated resources:  
     - 4P: full amount shown  
     - 3P/2P: one fewer resource of each type  
   - These become neutral exploitations (no owner).  
5. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player chooses a color and takes matching components.  
   - Set Guild Board to correct player count side.  
   - Place on Guild Board:  
     - 5 Buildings  
     - 3 Building Sites  
     - 2 Craftsmen (3 in 2P)  
   - Arrange Meadow Tiles into 4 equal stacks on Guild Board:  
     - 4P: 3 per stack  
     - 3P: 4 per stack  
     - 2P: 5 per stack  
6. **First Player**: Randomly determine starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, perform **exactly two actions**. You may repeat the same action twice, except where noted. Actions are:

1. **Place a Craftsman**  
2. **Place a Building Site**  
3. **Explore a Fog Space**  
4. **Explore a Petrified Forest** (uses both actions)  
5. **Transport a Resource to a Building Site**  
6. **Erect a Building**

#### Action Details  
**1. Place a Craftsman**  
- Place one of your Craftsmen from your Guild Board onto any space with an Exploitation token.  
- Take the Exploitation token and place it face-down next to your Guild Board (for VP at end).  
- Add resources to the space as shown on the token:  
  - 4P: full amount  
  - 3P/2P: one fewer of each resource  
- If insufficient resources, place as many as available.  
- Cannot place a Craftsman if none available.

**2. Place a Building Site**  
- Place one of your Building Sites on an unoccupied half of a Ruins Space.  
- Each Ruins hex holds up to 2 Building Sites (same or different players).  
- Exception: In 2P, use full-hex Building Sites; only one per Ruins hex.  
- You cannot have more Building Sites on the board than Buildings remaining on your Guild Board.  
- Cannot place if no Building Sites available.

**3. Explore a Fog Space**  
- Take the top (leftmost) Meadow Tile from one of your stacks.  
- Place it on a Fog Space that is adjacent to:  
  - A space with your Craftsman, Building, or Building Site, OR  
  - An empty Meadow Space or placed Meadow Tile (i.e., no resources or tokens).  
- If a stack is emptied, leave it in place; it will score at game end.

**4. Explore a Petrified Forest (Costs 2 Actions)**  
- Same as Explore a Fog Space, but place tile on a Petrified Forest Space.  
- Uses both actions.  
- Otherwise identical placement rules.

**5. Transport a Resource to a Building Site**  
- Take **one** resource from any exploitation space:  
  - Occupied by your Craftsman  
  - Occupied by opponent’s Craftsman  
  - Neutral Exploitation (no Craftsman)  
- Transport it to one of your Building Sites via an uninterrupted path of **empty Meadow Spaces** (no resources, tokens, or buildings).  
- Path may cross placed Meadow Tiles or cleared meadow spaces.  
- After moving:  
  - If the source space now has **no resources left**, return the Craftsman (if present) to its owner’s Guild Board.  
  - The space becomes an empty Meadow Space (can now be traversed).  
- Restrictions:  
  - Cannot transport through non-empty spaces.  
  - Cannot deliver to opponent’s Building Site.  
  - Building Sites are non-directional: any edge access counts.  
  - Resources on Building Sites cannot be moved again.

**6. Erect a Building**  
- Choose a Contract:  
  - One of your hidden Private Contracts, OR  
  - One of the 4 face-up Neutral Contracts on the board.  
- Select one of your Building Sites that contains **all** required resources listed on the Contract.  
- Execute:  
  - Return required resources to supply.  
  - Return Building Site to your Guild Board.  
  - Place one Building from your Guild Board on the Ruins hex.  
  - Use the Contract card’s power immediately (optional; lost if not used).  
  - Place completed Contract face-down in your play area.  
  - If Neutral Contract was used, replace it with top card from deck.  
- **Excess Resources**: Any extra resources on the Building Site go to your Storage Area (−1 VP each at end).  
- You may build even with leftover resources.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Meadow Expansion**: Placing Meadow Tiles opens pathways for resource transport.  
- **Resource Flow**: Resources are generated via Craftsmen and moved via transport through empty meadows.  
- **Building Limitation**: Number of Building Sites on board ≤ Buildings remaining on Guild Board.  
- **Action Economy**: Most actions cost 1 action; exploring Petrified Forest costs 2.  
- **Stack Mechanics**: Meadow stacks are used left-to-right; when fully emptied, they reveal Explorer values (2/4/6/8 VP).  
- **Neutral Exploitations**: Special tiles replaced with resources; no owner, but can be used by all.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger**: When a player erects their **fifth building**, they take the End-of-Game Card. Their turn ends immediately. All other players take **one final turn**.

**Final Scoring Steps**:  
Each player calculates total VP from:
- Exploitation tokens collected (face-down next to board)  
- Completed Contracts (face-down in play area)  
- Explorer values from **emptied** Meadow Tile stacks on Guild Board:  
  - 1 stack emptied: 2 VP  
  - 2 stacks: 4 VP  
  - 3 stacks: 6 VP  
  - 4 stacks: 8 VP  
- End-of-Game Card: +2 VP (only for player who triggered end game)  
- **Penalty**: −1 VP for each resource token in Storage Area (on Guild Board)

**Winning**: Highest total VP wins.  
**Tiebreaker**: Among tied players, the one with **fewest resources in Storage Area** wins.  
If still tied, all tied players win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I explore without meadow tiles?**  
  Yes. If you run out, use tiles from the general reserve (if available).  

- **Can I transport from a neutral exploitation?**  
  Yes. Neutral exploitations (from special tiles) can be used by any player.  

- **Can I transport to any side of a ruin hex?**  
  Yes. Building Sites are non-directional. Any path reaching the hex counts.  

- **What happens if I can’t place all resources when placing a Craftsman?**  
  Place as many as available. The rest are not added.  

- **Can I complete a contract with more resources than needed?**  
  Yes, but excess goes to storage (−1 VP each).  

- **Do unused private contracts score?**  
  No. Only completed (face-down) contracts count. Unused ones are ignored.  

- **Can two players build on the same ruin hex?**  
  Yes, in 3P/4P: each takes one half. In 2P: only one full Building Site per hex.  

- **Can I place a building site if I have no buildings left?**  
  No. You must have at least one building remaining to place a site.
