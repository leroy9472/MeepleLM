## Encyclopedia – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Encyclopedia*, players take on the roles of 18th-century naturalists competing to document and publish research on animals from around the world. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by conducting expeditions, gathering expert knowledge, and publishing findings in a prestigious scientific journal. Success requires strategic planning, efficient use of resources, and timely publications.

### 2. Components  
- Animal Cards (including Legendary Animals)  
- Expert Cards  
- Royal Edict Cards (expansion)  
- Event Cards (expansion)  
- Continent Reference Cards (solo mode)  
- Central Board with action spaces  
- Player Boards  
- Dice (colored: red, blue, yellow, green, purple)  
- Research Cubes  
- Coins  
- Expedition Tokens  
- Royal Seals  
- First Player Marker  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the central board in the middle of the table.  
2. Shuffle the Animal Card deck and place it face down.  
3. Place Expert Cards, Coins, Expedition Tokens, and Royal Seals in separate supplies.  
4. Each player receives a Player Board and starting resources (as per base game rules).  
5. **For expansions:**  
   - Shuffle Legendary Animal cards (e.g., *Caerbannogus cuniculus*) into the Animal deck.  
   - Shuffle Event Cards and place them face down next to the board.  
   - Place chosen Royal Edict Cards next to the board if used.  
6. Determine the first player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds. Each round consists of the following phases:

#### Action Selection Phase  
Players take turns choosing one of the following actions (each action can be used only once per round unless otherwise specified):

1. **Embassy**  
   - Place a die on the Embassy space.  
   - Effect: Prepare for future voyages (no immediate gain, but may trigger bonuses via expansions).

2. **Bank**  
   - Place a die on the Bank.  
   - Effect: Earn 5 coins.  
   - The first player to place a die here takes the First Player marker (unless overridden by Royal Edict #3).

3. **University**  
   - Place a die on the University.  
   - Effect: Take any Expert Card.  
   - Bonus: If the die color matches the Expert Card’s color, gain 1 Expedition Token.

4. **Academy**  
   - Place a die on the Academy.  
   - Effect: Take any Animal Card whose continent color matches the die color.  
   - No bonus.

5. **Expedition**  
   - Step 1: Place die on the leftmost available space of its matching colored continent on the central board.  
     - Gain the reputation bonus shown in the square.  
     - Gain the expedition value bonus shown in the circle below.  
   - Step 2: Calculate total Expedition Value:  
     - Die value + Placement bonus + Expert card bonuses + 1 per coin spent + 2 per Expedition Token spent + 5 per Royal Seal spent.  
     - A coin may increase any die value by 1.  
   - Step 3: Spend points to place research cubes on Animal Cards from the chosen continent only.  
     - Cost per cube depends on the animal type (refer to board).  
   - Step 4: Score VP equal to the value under each cube placed.  

6. **Publication**  
   - Step 1: Choose a Reference Animal.  
     - Die color must match the animal’s continent.  
     - Die number must match one of the available category types (based on board).  
   - Step 2: Publish Categories  
     - Remove cube(s) from the Reference Animal and place them on matching category spaces in the Publication section.  
     - Gain VP equal to the value of each category space.  
     - Optional: Remove and publish matching category cubes from other animals in your tableau (any continent).  
   - Step 3: Publish Continent  
     - Take the Reference Animal and all other same-continent animals from which you published cubes and place them face down in your play area. Gain 1 VP per card.  
     - Optional: Turn over same-continent cards you did *not* publish cubes from.  
   - Step 4: Clean Up  
     - Discard Animal Cards from *different* continents where cubes were removed.  
     - Return unpublished cubes to the supply.  
     - Take 1 Royal Seal.

#### End of Round  
- Return all dice.  
- First player passes to the left (unless Royal Edict #3 changes this).  
- Draw Event Cards (if using Events expansion) based on difficulty level.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Dice Placement**: Each action requires placing a die. Only one die per space per round.  
- **Color Matching**: Many actions require die color to match continent or card color.  
- **Resource Management**: Coins, Expedition Tokens, and Royal Seals can boost Expedition values.  
- **Research & Publication**: Research cubes must be placed via Expeditions. Publications score big VP but may force discards.  
- **Expert Cards**: Provide ongoing bonuses or one-time effects. Some grant +1 to Expedition value, +coins, or special abilities.  
- **Legendary Animals** (Expansion):  
  - Must be researched via Expedition to their continent.  
  - Expedition value must meet or exceed the value on the card.  
  - Once researched, gain one of three types of abilities:  
    1. **Immediate Use**  
    2. **Ongoing Effect**  
    3. **Endgame Trigger**  
  - Publishing a Legendary Animal ends its ability use.  
- **Event Cards** (Expansion):  
  - Draw per round based on difficulty.  
  - Examples:  
    - +2 VP per America card published (Card 29)  
    - Discard Expedition Token for 3 VP (Card 33)  
    - Gain 2 VP per cube published (Card 34)  
    - Draw and draft Animal Cards (Card 35)  
    - Use special die-placement zones that multiply value (Cards 38–42)  
- **Royal Edicts** (Expansion):  
  - Optional rule modifiers. Examples:  
    - #2: Place die on any Expedition space.  
    - #3: First to publish takes First Player.  
    - #24: +1 Expedition Token when performing Embassy.  
    - #25: +1 Reputation at Academy.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when the Animal Card deck is empty and no more actions can be taken.

**Final Scoring:**  
- 1 VP per published Animal Card (from same-continent groupings).  
- 1 VP per Animal Card in continent collections (if applicable).  
- VP from published categories.  
- VP from Event Cards (e.g., discard tokens or seals for VP).  
- VP from abilities that trigger at endgame.  
- **Collections**: Some Expert Cards or Legendary Abilities allow adding cards to continent collections at endgame (use Solo Mode Continent Cards to track).  

Highest total VP wins. Tiebreaker: Fewest unpublished animals.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use multiple resources in one Expedition?**  
  Yes. You may spend coins, tokens, and Royal Seals together to boost your value.  

- **Can I research animals from multiple continents during one Expedition?**  
  No. You may only place cubes on animals from the continent matching your die.  

- **What happens if I publish a card but don’t publish all its cubes?**  
  Unpublished cubes are returned to supply. The card remains unless discarded due to continent mismatch.  

- **Can a Legendary Animal be a Reference Animal in Publication?**  
  No. You may publish cubes *from* it, but it cannot be the Reference Animal.  

- **Does the Caerbannogus cuniculus stay in play?**  
  No. When drawn, it attacks the First Player (who discards one Expert Card), then returns to the deck and is shuffled back in.  

- **Can I use Royal Seals for anything besides Expeditions?**  
  Only as indicated (e.g., Event Card #37 allows discarding a Royal Seal for 6 VP).  

- **How do Event Cards interact with solo mode?**  
  The Automa draws and resolves Events but does not benefit from positive effects.  

- **Can I choose not to gain all Reputation from an action?**  
  Yes, if Royal Edict #1 is in play.
