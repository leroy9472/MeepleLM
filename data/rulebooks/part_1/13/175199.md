# Mottainai — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Mottainai*, players are acolytes in a Buddhist temple creating and selling artistic Works made from five Materials: Paper, Stone, Cloth, Clay, and Metal. Each Work has a value (1–3) representing both the difficulty to complete and its point value. The goal is to score the most points by completing and displaying Works, making Sales, and fulfilling Backorders. The concept of *mottainai*—avoiding waste—reinforces the game’s theme of respecting the soul in every object.

**Objective**: Score the most points through Completed Works, Covered Sales, Backorders, and special card effects.

### 3. Setup  
1. Give each player a Temple Mat.
2. Shuffle 1 deck (2–3 players) or 2 decks (4–5 players).
3. Deal 5 cards face down to each player (Hand).
4. Deal 1 card face down into each player’s **Task Slot**.
5. Each player reveals the top card of the Deck and places it face up on the **Floor**.
6. The player whose revealed card is alphabetically closest to "A" becomes the **Start Player**.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn has three phases: **Morning**, **Noon**, and **Night**.

#### Morning  
1. **Check Hand Size**: If >5 cards in Hand, Return excess cards (face down to bottom of Deck) until 5 remain.
2. **Discard Task to Floor**: Move the card from your Task Slot to the Floor (face up).
3. **In the Morning Effects**: Apply any "In the Morning" effects from your Completed Works, in any order (each once per turn).
4. **Select New Task (Optional)**: Place a card from your Hand into your Task Slot (face down). If you skip, you will **Pray** during your own Task.

#### Noon  
1. **Do Opponents’ Tasks**: In clockwise order starting with the player to your left, perform each opponent’s Task (if they have one; skip if empty or face down).
2. **Do Your Task**: Perform your own Task (if placed). If no Task, perform **Pray** (draw 1 card to Waiting Area).

For **each Task performed**:
- Count Actions: 1 base Action + 1 bonus Action per matching Helper.
- If all Helpers of that type are **Covered**, each grants 2 bonus Actions instead of 1.
- Perform all Actions. You may convert any Action to **Craft** or **Pray**.
- You must use all Actions. New Helpers or cards gained mid-Task do not affect Action count.

#### Night  
1. **At Night Effects**: Apply any "At Night" effects from Completed Works, in any order (each once per turn).
2. **Move Waiting Area to Hand**: Transfer all cards from Waiting Area to Hand.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions  
Each Action taken during a Task must be one of the following:

| Action | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Clerk** | Move 1 card from Craft Bench to Sales. |
| **Monk** | Take 1 card from Floor and add to Helpers. |
| **Tailor** | Return any number of cards from Hand to bottom of Deck. Then draw cards to Waiting Area until Hand + Waiting Area = 5 cards total. |
| **Potter** | Take 1 card from Floor and add to Craft Bench. |
| **Smith** | Complete a Work from Hand using support cards from Hand. The Work counts as 1 toward its value. Support cards are Revealed (not discarded). |
| **Craft** (replaces any Task Action) | Complete a Work from Hand using support cards from Craft Bench. The Work must match the replaced Task’s type (e.g., replacing Clerk → Craft a Paper Work). Support cards remain in Craft Bench. |
| **Pray** (replaces any Action) | Draw 1 card to Waiting Area. |

#### Completing Works  
- A Work is **Completed** when you use **Smith** or **Craft** to meet its value.
- Example: A value-3 Work needs 2 support cards + the Work itself.
- Support cards are **Revealed**, not discarded.
- Completed Work is placed in **Gallery** (left) or **Gift Shop** (right).

#### Cover System (All-or-Nothing)  

**Covered Helpers (Gallery)**:
- A Completed Work in the **Gallery** Covers Helpers of matching type.
- A Work of value *N* Covers up to *N* Helpers of its type.
- **All Helpers of a type must be Covered** for any to gain bonus Actions.
- Covered Helper: Grants **2 bonus Actions** instead of 1.

**Covered Sales (Gift Shop)**:
- A Completed Work in the **Gift Shop** Covers Sales of matching type.
- A Work of value *N* Covers up to *N* Sales of its type.
- **All Sales of a type must be Covered** for any to score points.
- Covered Sale: Worth its **Value** in points.
- Uncovered Sale: Worth **0 points**, but still counts toward Backorder majority.

#### Support Requirements by Material  
| Material | Value | Support Needed (Craft/Smith) |
|--------|------|-------------------------------|
| Paper | 1 | 0 |
| Paper | 2 | 1 |
| Paper | 3 | 2 |
| Stone/Cloth | 1 | 0 |
| Stone/Cloth | 2 | 1 |
| Stone/Cloth | 3 | 2 |
| Clay/Metal | 1 | 0 |
| Clay/Metal | 2 | 1 |
| Clay/Metal | 3 | 2 |

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End  
The game ends **immediately** when any of the following occur:
- A player places a **fifth Completed Work** in one Wing (Gallery or Gift Shop).
- The **last card is drawn** from the Deck.
- A card effect requires more cards to be Revealed than remain in the Deck.
- A card directly ends the game (e.g., **Cup**, **Turtle**).

No further actions or effects occur. Proceed directly to Final Scoring.

#### Final Scoring  
Each player scores points from four categories:

1. **Completed Works**  
   - +Value of each Completed Work in **Gallery** and **Gift Shop**.

2. **Covered Sales**  
   - +Value of each **Covered Sale**.
   - All Sales of a type must be Covered to score any.
   - Uncovered Sales = 0 points.

3. **Backorders**  
   - For each Material type (Paper, Stone, Cloth, Clay, Metal):
     - Player with **most Sales** (Covered or not) of that type scores:
       - +Sum of Values of cards of that type **in Hand**.
     - **Tie**: No player scores for that Material.
     - Waiting Area cards **do not count**.

4. **Special Works Effects**  
   - Add points from Completed Works with conditional scoring (e.g., Bench, Coin, Haniwa, Lampshade, Pillar, Quilt, Scroll, Tapestry, Teapot).

**Total Score** = Sum of above four categories.

#### Tiebreaker  
- Player with the **most points** wins.
- **Tie**: The current player (or the next tying player in turn order) wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip an Action?**  
  No. You must use all Actions earned during a Task. If you can’t perform the original Task Action, you may convert to Craft or Pray.

- **Can I reuse support cards?**  
  Yes. Support cards (from Hand for Smith, from Craft Bench for Craft) are Revealed but not discarded. They can be reused.

- **When does Cover update?**  
  Cover is recalculated at the start of each Task. If you Complete a Work during an Action, its Cover effect applies from the **next Task onward**.

- **Can I place a Task card face up?**  
  No. Task cards are placed face down. Opponents skip your Task until you reveal it (on your next Morning phase).

- **Can I Complete the same Work twice?**  
  Only in **4–5 player games**: Yes. Both copies can be Completed and both effects trigger.

- **Extended Game (Optional Rule)**:  
  Play to **6 Completed Works** in one Wing to end the game.

- **Team Play (4P)**:  
  - Sit opposite teammate.
  - Teammates do not affect each other with card effects.
  - Final score = sum of both teammates’ scores.
