## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Wilderness War is a two-player wargame simulating the French and Indian War (1754–1762) in North America. Players take the roles of the British and French colonial forces, competing for control of key strategic locations, conducting raids, battles, and sieges. The goal is to gain Victory Points (VPs) through military and strategic dominance, with victory conditions varying by scenario.

Objective:  
- Achieve sudden death victory by controlling all fortresses and occupying Niagara and Ohio Forks.  
- Reach 11 VPs.  
- Meet scenario-specific conditions (e.g., control specific fortresses by 1759).  
- If no sudden victory, the player with more VPs wins; otherwise, a draw.

2. Components

5. Core Mechanics  
a) Strategy Card Use  
Each card may be used for:  
- OPs: Activate units/leaders  
- Construction: Build stockades or forts  
- Event: Trigger card effect  

b) Activation & Movement  
- **Drilled Troops (square)**: One per card; may move, battle, raid, or siege  
- **Auxiliaries (round)**: Number ≤ card value; Indians count as ½ unit  
- **Leader Force**: Activate if Leader’s Initiative ≤ OP value; force size ≤ sum of Command ratings  
- **Movement Rules**:  
  - Drilled troops in wilderness must stop after one space unless with Auxiliaries or entering fortification  
  - Auxiliaries in enemy cultivated space must stop after one space unless with Drilled Troops  
  - All units stop in mountain spaces unless in friendly fortification  
  - Only Drilled Troops may enter unbeseiged enemy fort/fortress  
  - Boat movement: up to 9 spaces; one land link allowed between friendly cultivated or fortified spaces  
  - Naval movement: between friendly ports; requires 3-OP card for forces  
  - Amphibious Landing: British only; requires Amphibious Landing card + OP card  

c) Battle  
- Triggered when units enter enemy-occupied space or via interception  
- **Avoiding Battle**:  
  - 1d6 + Tactics ≥ 4 succeeds  
  - Auxiliaries in wilderness/mountain avoid automatically if enemy lacks Auxiliaries  
- **Combat Procedure**:  
  1. Militia may join if in originally friendly cultivated space and no Raid marker  
  2. Events played (attacker first)  
     - Ambush: doubles combat factor, attacker fires first  
  3. Calculate combat strength:  
     - + Tactics rating  
     - Modifiers:  
       - -1 if only one side has Auxiliaries/Light Infantry in wilderness/mountain  
       - -1 if only one side has Regulars in cultivated space  
       - -1 if attacker in amphibious landing  
       - -1 if attacking stockade  
       - 1 column shift left if attacking fieldworks  
  4. Roll 1d6, apply modifiers, consult CRT  
  5. Assign losses:  
     - Attacker assigns first  
     - At least half of losses must be Drilled Troops if present  
     - No unit eliminated until all are reduced  
     - Regulars and Coureurs permanently eliminated  
  6. Leader loss check on natural 1 or 6 (if at least 1 step lost): 1d6, eliminate on 1  
  7. Winner:  
     - Sole survivor, or most losses inflicted (defender wins ties)  
     - 1 VP if loser had 1 Regular or >4 units  
  8. Retreat:  
     - Loser retreats to adjacent space or into fort/fortress  
     - Drilled troops must retreat to cultivated space or fortification  
     - Attacker retreats to origin space  
     - Defender cannot retreat to attacker’s origin  
     - Units unable to retreat are eliminated  

d) Siege  
- Requires Drilled Troops and Leader in space  
- Activate highest Command Leader, roll 1d6 + Tactics (besieger) - Tactics (defender) -1 (if Louisbourg)  
- On 3–5: +1 Siege Level; on 6+: +2  
- Assault possible at Siege Level 1 (fort) or 2 (fortress)  
- Assault CRT: -1 DRM to attacker, +2 if Coehorns used  
- All losses from Drilled Troops first  
- Winner captures fort (reduced) or fortress (intact)  

e) Raid  
- Conducted by Auxiliaries without Drilled Troops in:  
  - Originally enemy cultivated space  
  - Enemy stockade  
  - Enemy-allied Indian settlement  
- Defender may play Blockhouses  
- Roll 1d6 + Tactics +1 (if Rangers) -1 (if >1 Militia in Dept)  
- Success:  
  - Place Raided marker  
  - Destroy stockade  
  - Eliminate Indians if settlement raided  
- Leader loss on natural 1 (always) or 6 (if stockade/settlement)  
- Raiders redeploy:  
  - Indians go home (with Coureurs/Leaders)  
  - Non-Indians to nearest friendly fortification  

f) Construction  
- Stockade: up to OP value in spaces with Drilled Troops or originally friendly cultivated (no enemy units)  
- Fort: up to OP value in spaces with Drilled Troops (two turns required)  
- Cannot build two turns in a row  
- Stockades captured if enemy Drilled Troops enter; destroyed if battle won  

g) Supply  
- Drilled Troops must trace supply to:  
  - Originally friendly fortress  
  - Captured port (British)  
  - Amphib marker (British)  
- Supply path: connected chain via cultivated spaces, fortifications, Amphib markers, or water links  
- Blocked by enemy units or fortifications  
- Out of supply:  
  - Cannot build fortifications  
  - Cannot roll on Siege Table  
  - Cannot use SURRENDER!  
  - Cannot restore to full strength  

h) Winter Phase  
- **Indians & Leaders Go Home**:  
  - Indians not in fortifications return to settlements  
  - Lone leaders in wilderness/mountain move to nearest fortification  
- **Remove Raided Markers**:  
  - Score ½ VP per marker (round up)  
- **Winter Attrition**:  
  - Units avoid attrition if in:  
    - Originally friendly cultivated space  
    - Unbesieged fort/stockade with ≤4 units  
    - Unbesieged fortress  
  - Otherwise:  
    - Eliminate every odd reduced Drilled Troop  
    - Reduce every full Drilled Troop  
    - Last unit in space never eliminated  
- **Victory Check**:  
  - Sudden death: control all fortresses + Niagara + Ohio Forks → British win  
  - 11+ VPs → that side wins  
  - Annus Mirabilis: British control all original British fortresses + 2 of Quebec, Montreal, Niagara, Ohio Forks → British win  
  - Else: French win if ≥1 VP; British win if ≥5 VP (1762 end)  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Victory Conditions:  
- Immediate British win: control all fortresses + Niagara + Ohio Forks  
- 11+ VPs: side wins  
- Scenario-specific:  
  - 1759 end: British win if control original British fortresses + 2 of Quebec, Montreal, Niagara, Ohio Forks  
  - 1762 end: French win if ≥1 VP; British win if ≥5 VP  
- Else: higher VP wins; tie = draw  

Victory Points:  
- Capture fortress: +3  
- Capture fort: +2  
- Capture/destroy stockade: +1  
- Capture Niagara or Ohio Forks: +1 each  
- Win battle (vs. Regular or >4 units): +1

- Massacre played on you: -1  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Ambush**: Doubles combat factor, attacker fires first; CRT applied after doubling  
- **Retreat over wilderness**: Drilled troops must retreat to cultivated or fortification within range; if not possible, eliminated  
- **Leader death**: Only on natural 1 or 6 in battle/raid, and only if at least 1 step lost  
- **Militia**: Cannot assault; return to box after battle; only participate in cultivated spaces without Raid markers  
- **Supply**: Fort under construction does not count as fort for supply  
- **Infiltration**: Lone Auxiliary may move through enemy units/forts; may be intercepted  
- **Interception**: 1d6 + Tactics ≥ 4; battle in interception space; defender benefits from stockade  
- **Construction**: Stockade destroyed if enemy wins battle; fort under construction removed if uncontested
