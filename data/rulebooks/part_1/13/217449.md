## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In NMBR9, players build personal displays using identical number tiles drawn from a shared pool. The goal is to score the most victory points (VP) by placing number tiles on higher levels—each tile’s value is multiplied by its level. The player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, tied players share the win.

2. Components  
- 80 number tiles: 8 of each number from "0" to "9"  
- 20 number cards: 2 of each number from "0" to "9"  

3. Setup  
- Shuffle the 20 number cards and place them face-down as a draw pile.  
- Place the 80 number tiles in the box inlay, sorted by number, and make them accessible to all players.  
- Each player plays on their own play area (table surface).  
- Any tile placed directly on the table is on the 0th level. Tiles placed on top of others are on higher levels (1st, 2nd, etc.).

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of 20 rounds, one for each card drawn.  
Each round proceeds as follows:  
1. A player draws the top card from the draw pile and announces the number aloud.  
2. The card is placed face-up on the discard pile.  
3. All players simultaneously take one number tile matching the announced number from the supply.  
4. Each player places their tile in their own display, following placement rules.  
5. Once all players have placed their tile, the round ends and the next round begins.  
Play continues until all 20 cards are drawn and all tiles placed.

5. Core Mechanics  
Tile Placement Rules:  
- Tiles must be placed number-side up, but may be rotated freely.  
- Placing on the same level (horizontal placement):  
  - At least one full side of a square must be adjacent to a square of an existing tile on that level.  
  - Corner-to-corner contact is not sufficient.  
- Placing on 1st level or higher (vertical stacking):  
  - The entire tile must lie completely on top of squares of tiles on the level below.  
  - The tile must rest on squares of **at least two different tiles** from the lower level.  
  - Overhangs or placement over gaps are not allowed.  
- Players may choose any valid level for placement—even if a higher level is possible.  
- Once placed, tiles cannot be moved.  
- Players may only use the tile corresponding to the current round’s drawn number.  
- Players may experiment with placement during their turn but must finalize placement before the next round.  

Level Definition:  
- 0th level: Any tile placed directly on the table.  
- 1st level: Tiles placed entirely on top of 0th level tiles (and meeting the two-tile support rule).  
- 2nd level: Tiles placed entirely on top of 1st level tiles, and so on.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends immediately after the 20th card is drawn and all tiles are placed.  
- Scoring:  
  - Each tile scores: (number on the tile) × (level it is on).  
  - Tiles on the 0th level score 0 VP.  
  - Players disassemble their display from top to bottom, summing points.  
- The player with the highest total wins.  
- In case of a tie, tied players share the win.  

Example: An "8" on the 2nd level scores 8 × 2 = 16 points.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I place a tile on a higher level even if a lower level has space?  
  Yes. You may choose any valid level, including skipping intermediate levels, as long as stacking rules are followed.  
- Can a tile be supported by tiles on different levels?  
  No. A tile must be placed entirely on one level, supported only by tiles from the immediately lower level.  
- Can I rotate the tile?  
  Yes. Any orientation is allowed, as long as the number is face up.  
- What if I can’t place a tile?  
  The rules do not allow skipping placement. A legal placement always exists (e.g., on the 0th level with side adjacency).  
- Can I copy another player’s layout?  
  Yes, but doing so cannot yield a higher score than the original.  
- Solitaire variant: Same rules apply. Goal is to beat personal best. 100+ points is considered excellent.
