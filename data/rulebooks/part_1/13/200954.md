### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each of the 4 rounds represents one year and follows this sequence:

#### Upkeep Phase  
1. **Advance Year Token**: Update Turn Order Marker direction (clockwise for odd years, counterclockwise for even).  
2. **Receive Resources**:  
   - Each player gains:  
     - 1 Food → placed on any Silo (max 4 per Silo; excess is lost)  
     - 2 Water → placed on any Water Tower (max 3 per Tower; excess is lost)  
     - 3 Coins  
   - *Skip in Round 1.*  
3. **Draw Cards**:  
   - Each player draws **6 cards total** from the 4 main piles.  
   - Must draw from **at least 3 of the 4 piles** (e.g., 3-2-1-0).  
   - All cards drawn at once; distribution is public knowledge.  
   - If a pile is empty, no more cards can be drawn from it.  

> **2-Player Variant**:  
> - Both players draw 6 cards (12 total), shuffle them, and form a face-down deck.  
> - Reveal top 6 cards face-up.  
> - On each turn, players take turns choosing from face-up cards (see Action Phase).  

> **5–6 Player Adjustments**:  
> - 5 players: 6 cards per player per year  
> - 6 players: 5 cards per player per year  

#### Action Phase (6 Turns)  
Each turn:

2. **Choose One Action**:  
   - **Build Location**  
   - **Build Water Tower**  
   - **Build Silo**  
   - **Go to Market**  

> **2-Player Rule**:

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build a Location I can’t harvest later?**  
  Yes, but if you fail to pay Harvest cost, it becomes an Open Area.  
- **Can I move Water between Towers?**  
  No. Water is tied to specific Towers.  
- **Can I use Food from a full Silo to pay a cost?**  
  Yes. You may spend Food even if Silo is full.  
- **Can I build on top of an Open Area?**  
  No. Open Areas are dead zones.  
- **What if I can’t place an Equipment?**  
  Keep it aside. Place it when a valid Location is built (must do so **immediately**).  
- **What if a card pile runs out?**  
  No more cards can be drawn from that pile. Continue with remaining piles.  
- **Can I use a Harvest Ability’s output to pay another Harvest cost?**  
  Yes, if resolved in order (e.g., gain Water, then use it for next cost).
