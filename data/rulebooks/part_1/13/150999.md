## Valley of the Kings: Moonfrog’s Solitaire Variant (VOTK)

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are an Egyptian noble preparing your tomb for the afterlife. In this solitaire variant, you compete not just against the game system, but against a simulated opponent—the Bot—representing a rival noble. Your goal is to outscore the Bot by strategically acquiring and entombing valuable artifacts.

### 2. Components  
- 96 Artifact cards (Level I, II, III)  
- 1 Tomb card (player)  
- 1 Reference card  
- 1 Stock (combined Level II and Level III decks)  
- 1 Pyramid (6-card layout from Stock)  
- 1 Boneyard (face-up discard)  
- 1 Player draw deck and discard pile  
- Bot’s tomb and discard pile (no hand)  
- 6-sided die  
- Shuffled Bot starter cards (Shabtis, Urns, Boxes of Food, Offering Tables not used by player)

*Note: All standard Valley of the Kings components are used, with modifications for solo play.*

### 3. Setup  
1. **Player Setup (Standard):**  
   - Each player takes a Tomb card and Reference card.  
   - Receive 10 starter cards: 4 Shabtis, 3 Urns, 2 Boxes of Food, 1 Offering Table.  
   - Remove **one Offering Table** (per variant rule: one less starter card).  
   - Shuffle remaining 9 starter cards to form draw deck.  
   - Draw **4 cards** (not 5) for starting hand (first-turn hand size rule).  

2. **Stock & Pyramid:**  
   - Combine Level II and Level III cards into Stock (Level II on top).  
   - Draw 6 cards to form Pyramid (3-2-1 layout).  
   - Draw 1 card to start Boneyard.  

3. **Bot Setup:**  
   - Form Bot deck: shuffle 30 unused starter cards (12 Shabtis, 9 Urns, 6 Boxes of Food, 3 Offering Tables).  
   - Place **3 Shabti cards** into Bot’s tomb.  
   - Place **1 Urn card** into Bot’s discard pile.  
   - Bot has no hand; all acquired cards go directly to tomb or discard as specified.

4. **Determine First Player:** The player who most recently visited a museum starts.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Turn order alternates: **Player → Bot → Player → Bot**, etc.  
After each player turn, resolve the Bot’s turn in two steps.

#### Player Turn (Standard Rules, Modified)  
Follow the four standard steps:
1. **Play Cards:** Use each card for one of:
   - Buy a card from the base of the Pyramid
   - Execute its action
   - Entomb one card (once per turn)
2. **Discard:** Discard all played and unplayed cards to personal discard pile.
3. **Rebuild Pyramid:**
   - If no changes to Pyramid, **sacrifice any one card** to Boneyard and crumble.
   - Refill Pyramid from Stock, base-up.
4. **Draw New Hand:** Draw 5 cards (after first turn).

*Note: First turn hand size is 4; all subsequent hands are 5.*

#### Bot Turn (After Each Player Turn)  
Perform two mandatory steps:

**1) Gain Step**  
- Roll a d6 to determine which card the Bot gains from the **bottom of the Pyramid**:  
  - 1 or 2 → Left card  
  - 3 → Middle card (crumble from left*)  
  - 4 → Middle card (crumble from right*)  
  - 5 or 6 → Right card  
  *Crumble occurs during Rebuild Step. The selected card is removed and placed in the Bot’s tomb.

**2) Rebuild Pyramid**  
- Crumble the Pyramid as normal due to removal.  
- Refill empty spaces from Stock, starting at base.

*Note: Gaining a card from the Pyramid counts as “buying” it for Bot scoring purposes.*

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Executing Actions Against the Bot  
When a card or effect targets “opponent,” it applies to the Bot as follows:
- **Sacrifice a card**: Take from **top of Bot’s discard pile**, place in Boneyard.  
- **Reference opponent’s deck**: Refers to **Bot’s tomb**.  
- **Discard from opponent’s hand**: Cards come from **Bot’s tomb** (since no hand).  
  - *Exception:* Sacrificed cards are taken from discard pile, not tomb.  
- **Multiple discards**: Must come from a single set; remove **lowest cost cards**. You choose which set.  
- **Limits per turn**:  
  - Max **one card per turn** that causes Bot to discard.  
  - Max **one card per turn** that causes Bot to sacrifice.

#### Removing Cards from Bot’s Tomb  
When removing a card from Bot’s tomb (for discard, sacrifice, etc.), follow priority:
1. Take any Level I card (if available).  
2. Else, take the **lowest cost Level II** card.  
3. Else, take the **lowest cost Level III** card.  
- In case of ties (same level and cost), **you choose** which card to remove.

#### Crumbling Pyramid  
- Standard crumbling rules apply.  
- When middle base card is removed, **active player chooses** which middle-row card crumbles down.  
- Top card is refilled from Stock after crumbling.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Conditions  
Game ends when:
- No cards left in Stock  
- Only **two cards remain in the Pyramid**  
*(Note: This differs from standard rules; no requirement for equal turns)*

#### Scoring  
1. **Pre-Scoring Adjustment**:  
   - Return the **top three cards** of the Bot’s discard pile to its tomb.  
2. **Player Scoring (Standard)**:  
   - Only cards in **player’s tomb** count.  
   - **Starter & Unique cards**: Add VP values.  
   - **Sets**: For each set, count **number of distinct cards**, square it. Duplicates score nothing.  
3. **Bot Scoring (Modified)**:  
   - Bot is **exempt** from “duplicates count against you” rule.  
   - For each set, identify duplicates:  
     - Set aside **one card per duplicate instance** (e.g., two Inner Sarcophagi → set aside one).  
     - Score remaining cards normally (distinct count, squared).  
     - Each **set-aside duplicate card** contributes its **gold value (top-left number)** as VP.  
   - Add VP from starter and unique cards normally.

#### Winning  
- The player with the **most points** wins.  
- No perfect score required (variant rule).  
- If tied, standard tiebreaker applies:  
  - Fewest cards in tomb wins.  
  - If still tied, shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I play multiple cards that target the Bot?**  
  A: No. Max one per turn that causes discard, and one that causes sacrifice.  

- **Q: What if Bot’s discard pile has fewer than 3 cards for pre-scoring?**  
  A: Return all available cards to tomb.  

- **Q: What if Bot’s tomb is empty when a card must be removed?**  
  A: Cannot execute action; if required, effect fails.  

- **Q: Does Bot draw cards?**  
  A: No. Bot gains cards only via Gain Step (from Pyramid) or pre-scoring adjustment.  

- **Q: Is Bot affected by actions that say “opponent may…”?**  
  A: Yes, but since Bot has no agency, such actions have no effect unless specified otherwise.  

- **Q: Does Bot take turns after game end is triggered?**  
  A: No. Game ends immediately when end conditions are met, even mid-sequence.
