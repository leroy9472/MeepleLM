## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
When I Dream immerses players in the surreal world of dreams, where Dream Spirits influence the dreams of a sleeping player—the Dreamer. Fairies guide the Dreamer toward correct guesses, Imps (or Boogeymen) mislead them, and Tricksters (or Sandmen) thrive on balance between success and failure.  

**Objective**: Score the most Dream Points by the end of the game. Fairies and the Dreamer earn points for correct guesses, Imps for incorrect ones, and Tricksters when scores are balanced.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the Dream Card pile in the center. If using a board, place it with Yellow (Fairy) and Blue (Imp) zones.  
2. Shuffle Dream Cards thoroughly (rotate and/or flip if double-sided) and place them on the "Bed" or in a draw pile.  
3. If using a headboard, cover one side of each Dream Card so only one Element per card is visible.  
4. Place the sandtimer and Dream Point tokens within reach.  
5. Select Spirit Cards based on player count. Unused cards go back in the box.  
6. The player who slept the most (or is oldest) becomes the first Dreamer. They take the sleeping mask.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **Rounds = Number of Players**. Each round has **5 Phases** (original) or **2 Phases** (alternate version). Below is the consolidated flow:

#### I. Start of Round  
- Dreamer shuffles Spirit Cards and deals one to each player (including themselves).  
- Each player views their Spirit Card privately.  
- One Spirit Card remains face-down on the table (hidden).  
- Dreamer puts on the mask.  
- Player to the right flips the 2-minute sandtimer.  
- Player to the left reveals the top Dream Card’s active Dream Piece.

#### II. The Dream  
- Starting with the player to the left of the Dreamer, players take turns clockwise giving **one-word clues** to describe the current Dream Piece.  
- The Dreamer may guess at any time, saying **one guess only**.  
  - If correct: Card goes under **Fairy Scoring Area** (Yellow).  
  - If incorrect or skipped: Card goes under **Imp Scoring Area** (Blue).  
- A new Dream Card is revealed immediately after a guess.  
- If all players give **2 clues** (or **3 clues** in 6-player games), the timer pauses and the Dreamer **must guess**. Timer resumes after next card is drawn.  
- If a clue breaks the rules (see Core Mechanics), the current card becomes a **Penalty Card** for that player. A new card is drawn.  
- When the 2 minutes end, the Dreamer may make **one final optional guess**. If not, the current card is discarded with no effect.  
- **Critical Rule**: The Dreamer **must never know** whether their guesses are correct.

#### III. Narration  
- Dreamer recounts the dream aloud, trying to name **all correctly guessed Dream Pieces** (those under Fairy pile).  
- Players may slightly rotate cards to help track.  
- If the Dreamer recalls **all correct guesses**, they earn **1 bonus Dream Point** (original) or **2 bonus points** (alternate version).  
- Then, Dreamer removes the mask.

#### IV. Scoring  
Players reveal their Spirit Cards and score:  
- **Fairy Spirits**: 1 point per card in **Fairy pile** (Yellow).  
- **Imp Spirits**: 1 point per card in **Imp pile** (Blue).  
- **Dreamer**: 1 point per card in Fairy pile + bonus for full recall (1 or 2 points).  
- **Trickster (Sandman) Spirits**:  
  - If piles are **equal**: Score **all cards in one pile + 2 bonus points**.  
  - If one pile is **1 card larger**: Score **number of cards in the larger pile**.  
  - If one pile is **2+ cards larger**: Score **number of cards in the smaller pile**.  

*Example*: Fairy pile = 3, Imp pile = 5 → Trickster scores 3 (smaller pile).

#### V. End of Round  
- All Dream Cards are returned to the bottom of the deck (shuffled/rotated).  
- The player to the left of the current Dreamer becomes the next Dreamer.  
- They take the mask and **all Spirit Cards** (including the face-down one).

### 5. Core Mechanics  
**Clue Rules (Strict)**:  
- Only **one word** per turn.  
- Cannot use:  
  - Any form or part of the Dream Piece name.  
  - Translations in other languages.  
  - Sounds, gestures, or non-words.  
  - Made-up words or portmanteaus.  
- If a player breaks rules or says >1 word:  
  - Current Dream Card becomes their **Penalty Card**.  
  - New Dream Card is revealed.  
  - Announce “New card revealed” so Dreamer knows.  

**Optional Rule**: If a player takes >5 seconds to clue, their turn is skipped.

**Skipping**:  
- Player can say “Pass” to skip their clue turn.  
- Dreamer can say “Pass” to skip guessing; card goes to Imp pile.

**Dream Piece Selection**:  
- At game start, players agree to use **top or bottom** Dream Piece on cards (recommended: top for beginners).  
- In **Experienced Players Variant**:  
  - Start with top piece.  
  - If Dreamer guesses correctly, next card uses top piece.  
  - If incorrect, next card uses bottom piece.  
  - This continues throughout the round.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- After all players have been Dreamer once, the game ends.  
- Each player:  
  - Totals their Dream Points.  
  - **Subtracts 1 point per Penalty Card** they collected.  
- **Winner**: Player with most points.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Fewest Penalty Cards.  
  2. If still tied:  
     - Original: Best dream story (judged by group).  
     - Alternate: Players share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can the Dreamer hear the clues after guessing?**  
A: Yes, but they must not learn whether their guess was correct. Players must avoid reactions.

**Q: What if the Dreamer guesses correctly but the clue was invalid?**  
A: If a clue breaks rules, the card is a penalty regardless of guess outcome.

**Q: Can the same word be used as a clue more than once?**  
A: Yes, unless it violates the naming rule (e.g., if the word is part of the answer).

**Q: Do Penalty Cards affect others’ scoring?**  
A: No. Only the player who broke the rule gets the penalty. The round continues with a new card.

**Q: How are double-sided Dream Cards handled?**  
A: Shuffle by rotating/flipping so orientation is random. Use headboard to cover one side unless swapping variant is used.

**Q: Can the Dreamer guess during another player’s turn?**  
A: Yes, at any time, but only **one guess per Dream Piece**.
