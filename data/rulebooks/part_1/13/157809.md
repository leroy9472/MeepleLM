## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Nations: The Dice Game*, players guide their civilizations through four historical ages, striving to build the most prestigious and successful nation. Over the course of the game, players develop their economy, culture, and military strength by acquiring buildings, advisors, colonies, and wonders. Victory is measured in Victory Points (VPs), earned both during and at the end of the game. The player with the most VPs after the fourth age wins. In case of a tie, the player with the best turn order (closest to first) in Age 4 wins.

5. Core Mechanics  

**New Age Setup**  
- Remove all remaining Progress tiles and the previous Event tile.  
- Refill the Progress board with tiles from the current Age’s stack.  
- Reveal the current Age’s Event tile.  
- Return unused dice and chits from the previous Age’s used area to the player’s unused pool.  
- Flip player order cards back to active position (“Passed” not showing).  

**Action Step**  
- Players act in turn order, starting with Player 1.  
- At the start of your first turn each Age, roll all your available (unused) dice.  
- On your turn, choose one of the following actions or Pass:  

  - **Reroll**  
    - Cost: 1 unused Reroll chit  
    - Reroll any number of unused dice.  
    - Does not count as a die expenditure.  
    - (With Unrest expansion: Using a star-marked reroll chit does not cost an action.)  

  - **Buy Tile**  
    - Cost: Pay in Gold (♦) or Strength (⚔) equal to the row number of the tile:  
      - Row 1: 1 resource  
      - Row 2: 2 resources  
      - Row 3: 3 resources  
    - Pay using any combination of unused dice and chits showing the required resource.  
    - No change is given.  

    *Tile Types:*  
    - **Buildings**: Replace an existing building.  
      - Return the die shown on the old building to supply (choose used, unused, or mix).  
      - Take and immediately roll the die(s) shown on the new building.  
    - **Advisors**: Replace existing advisor (if any).  
      - Return the old Reroll chit to supply.  
      - Gain a new Reroll chit.  
    - **Colonies**: Place beside board. No limit.  
      - Gain any chit shown on the tile.  
    - **Wonders**: Place in upper right corner (under construction).  
      - Replaces any existing wonder (returned to box).  
      - No effect until built via Build Wonder action.  

  - **Build Wonder**  
    - Prerequisite: A wonder must be under construction.  
    - Cost: Stone (🞅) equal to the cost shown on the tile.  
    - Pay with unused dice/chits showing Stone.  
    - Place built wonder beside your board (permanent).  
    - Gain any chit shown on the tile.  
    - You may immediately reroll any number of unused dice.  

  - **Resolve Unrest (Unrest Expansion Only)**  
    - If any green dice show the Unrest symbol (fist):  
      - Option 1: Spend action to reroll all dice showing Unrest (no reroll chit cost).  
      - Option 2: Move all Unrest dice to used area (no action cost), then take a normal action.  

  - **Pass**  
    - Turn player order card sideways to show “Passed.”  
    - No further actions this Age.  
    - **Passing Order Bonuses (Unrest Expansion)**:  
      - First to pass: Takes one tile from Progress board and gains +1 of any resource this Age.  
      - Subsequent passers (in 3–4 player): Take one remaining tile.  
      - Last to pass: Gets nothing.  
    - Bonus tiles are returned after the Age.

**Trading Dice**  
- At any time, exchange 2 unused dice for 1 Gold, 1 Stone, or 1 Food.  
- Move the 2 dice to your used area.  
- Not an action; can be done multiple times.  
- Chits cannot be traded.

6. Scoring & End Game  

**Book Step**  
- In reverse player order:  
  - Players may spend unused Book (📘) dice/chits to move their marker on the Book track (1 space per 📘).  
  - Spent dice/chits go to used area.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - Each player gains 1 VP for every other player they have *more* Books than.  
  - No VPs for ties.  
  - (In solo/2-player: Score 2 VPs per player with fewer Books.)

**Famine Step**  
- In reverse player order:  
  - Players may spend Food (🌾) dice/chits equal to the number shown on the Event tile.  
  - Age 1: 1 Food → 1 VP  
  - Age 2: 2 Food → 2 VPs  
  - Age 3: 3 Food → 3 VPs  
  - Age 4: 4 Food → 4 VPs  
- Must pay full amount to score. No partial or excess benefit.  
- Spent resources go to used area.

**Player Order Step**  
- Determine new turn order for next Age:  
  - Rank players by unused Strength (⚔) dice and chits (highest = Player 1, etc.).  
  - Ties: Preserve previous relative order among tied players.  
- Dice/chits are **not** moved to used area during this step.

**War Step**  
- In reverse player order:  
  - Players may spend Strength (⚔) dice/chits equal to the number on the Event tile.  
  - Age 1: 1 ⚔ → 1 VP  
  - Age 2: 2 ⚔ → 2 VPs  
  - Age 3: 3 ⚔ → 3 VPs  
  - Age 4: 4 ⚔ → 4 VPs  
- Must pay full amount. No partial or excess benefit.  
- Spent resources go to used area.

**End Game Scoring (After Age 4)**  
- Add VPs from:  
  - Built Wonders (beside board)  
  - Colonies (beside board)  
  - Buildings (on player board)  
  - Advisors (on player board)  
- Wonders under construction (in upper right) are **not scored**.  
- Total all VPs from during-game and end-game sources.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with best turn order in Age 4 wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use a die I just gained from a building this turn?**  
  Yes. Newly gained dice are rolled immediately and can be used in the same turn.  
- **Can I trade dice after passing?**  
  No. Once passed, no actions or trades are allowed.  
- **Can I reroll only some dice showing Unrest?**  
  No. If using the Reroll action for Unrest, reroll *all* dice showing Unrest.  
- **Do I have to use the exact number of resources for Famine/War?**  
  Yes. You must pay exactly or more, but only full amounts score. Paying more gives no bonus.  
- **Can I have multiple built Wonders?**  
  Yes. There is no limit.  
- **Do chits count as resources for all purposes?**  
  Yes. Chits function identically to dice showing the same symbol.  
- **Can I buy a tile without having the exact resource type?**  
  No. Gold/Strength cost must be paid with corresponding symbols.  
- **Is the Book track position reset each round?**  
  No. The Book track is cumulative across all ages.
