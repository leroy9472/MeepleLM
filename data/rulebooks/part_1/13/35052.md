### 4. Gameplay Flow

Each power takes a turn in sequence. A full round ends after the United States player’s turn, at which point victory is checked.

#### Turn Sequence (7 Phases)

1. **Research & Development (Optional)**  
   - Buy researcher tokens (5 IPC each)  
   - Roll one die per token  
   - If any die shows 6: discard all tokens, choose breakthrough chart, roll for one tech  
   - Re-roll if already achieved; techs are tracked on R&D chart  

2. **Purchase Units**  
   - Spend IPCs to buy units or repair damaged industrial complexes (1 IPC per damage marker)  
   - Units purchased are placed in the Mobilization Zone (South Atlantic)  
   - Cannot exceed production capacity of industrial complexes (based on territory IPC value minus damage)  

3. **Combat Move**  
   - Move units into hostile territories or sea zones to initiate combat  
   - Tanks may blitz through unoccupied enemy territory (move 2 spaces, capture first)  
   - Transports may carry land units for amphibious assaults  
   - Aircraft must reserve movement to land safely  
   - Announce amphibious assaults  

4. **Conduct Combat**  
   - Resolve in this order:  
     a. **Strategic Bombing Raids**

     c. **General Combat**  

   - **Strategic Bombing**:  
     - AA guns fire first (hit on 1)  
     - Surviving bombers roll 1 die (or 2 for Heavy Bombers)  
     - Total = damage to industrial complex (max: 2× territory IPC value)  

   - **Amphibious Assault**:  
     - Sea combat if enemy surface warships present  
     - If no sea combat, battleships and cruisers may bombard (1 per land unit offloaded)  
     - Land combat: seaborne units cannot retreat; overland/air units may retreat together  

   - **General Combat**:  
     - Submarines may Surprise Strike or Submerge (if no enemy destroyer)  
     - Attacker rolls, defender assigns casualties  
     - Defender rolls, attacker assigns casualties  
     - Remove defender casualties  
     - Attacker may retreat or continue  

5. **Noncombat Move**  
   - Move units that did not move in Combat Move or participate in combat  
   - Land units: move into friendly territories (including newly captured)

   - Sea units: cannot enter hostile sea zones  
   - AA guns may only move during this phase  

6. **Mobilize New Units**  
   - Place units from Mobilization Zone into territories with industrial complexes you controlled since turn start  
   - Max units = IPC value of territory minus damage on complex  
   - Fighters may be placed on carriers in adjacent sea zones  
   - Cannot use newly captured or built complexes this turn  
   - Excess units remain in Mobilization Zone for future turns  

7. **Collect Income**

- The side (Axis or Allies) that controls the agreed number of victory cities wins:  
  - 13 = shorter game  
  - 15 = standard  
  - 18 = total victory  
- Capturing a capital:  
  - Gain all unspent IPCs from its owner  
  - Owner cannot collect income or buy units until capital is liberated  
- Liberating a territory:  
  - Returns to original owner if friendly capital is free  
  - Otherwise, capturer retains control and income  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can a fighter land on a carrier moved in noncombat?**  
  Yes, if the carrier moves to provide a landing spot and the fighter has enough movement.

- **Can you bomb a complex you just captured?**  
  No — complexes can only be damaged by strategic bombing or rockets.

- **Do multinational forces fight together?**  
  Yes in defense, no in attack. Only one power can attack per turn.

- **Can submarines be hit by aircraft?**  
  Only if a friendly destroyer is in the battle.

- **Can you retreat from amphibious assault?**  
  Transports can retreat during sea combat. Once offloaded, land units cannot retreat.

- **Can you move through neutral territories?**  
  No. Neutral territories (e.g., Turkey, Switzerland) are impassable.

- **Can you use a captured industrial complex immediately?**  
  No. Can only use it starting next turn.

- **Can a bomber do a bombing run and fight in combat?**  
  No. Strategic bombing replaces combat participation.
