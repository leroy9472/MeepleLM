# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The capital city of the universe, Mecatol City, is engulfed in revolution. The human Federation of Sol has attacked the ruling Lazax Empire, creating an opportunity for one of the galaxy’s six major races to seize power. Players represent one of these factions, vying to control key areas of the city. Victory is achieved by controlling strategic strongholds or fulfilling unique faction-specific conditions.

The game ends immediately if a player or alliance secures enough strongholds by the end of a turn. If no one wins by the end of eight turns, special victory conditions for Sol, Hacan, or Xxcha may apply.

## 2. Components
- Game board depicting Mecatol City with 28 spaces
- Influence tokens (currency)
- Hexagonal unit tokens for each faction
- Leader tokens for each faction
- Strategy cards (pink attack, blue defense, white other)
- Traitor cards (one per leader)
- Betrayal cards (optional)
- Influence deck (16 cards: 8 location, 4 Temporary Ceasefire, 4 Sol Offensive)
- Bombardment deck (18 cards, numbered 1–6)
- Battle dials
- First player token
- Dreadnought Fleet marker
- Ally Advantage cards
- Demolished Location token (for 3–4 player games)

## 3. Setup
1. Place the board and component pools (influence, strategy, bombardment decks).
2. Determine first player by drawing bombardment cards; lowest number starts.
3. Assign factions. Each player takes matching units, leaders, Ally Advantage, and Traitor cards.
4. Shuffle Traitor deck and deal 4 cards to each player. Each selects one to keep; return others to the deck.
   - Letnev draws 4 and keeps all; may redraw if 2+ own leaders drawn.
5. Place Dreadnought Fleet: players adjacent to first player secretly dial numbers; fleet is placed at the difference (min 1, max 18).
6. Each player draws 1 Strategy card (Letnev draws 2).
7. Distribute starting influence per faction.
8. Place starting units per faction setup.
   - Sol places before Xxcha.
9. Xxcha player makes a secret prediction: which player will win and in which round.
10. If using Betrayal cards, deal one randomly to each player.

For 3–4 players:
- 3 players: no alliances; place Demolished Location token on Mecatol Power South.
- 4 players: alliances limited to 2 players; place Demolished Location token on Mecatol Power South.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds through seven phases:
1. **Influence Phase** – Reveal and resolve top Influence card.
2. **Bidding Phase** – Bid for Strategy cards.
3. **Recruitment Phase** – Revive units and leaders.
4. **Maneuvering Phase** – Move and deploy units.
5. **Battle Phase** – Resolve conflicts.
6. **Collection Phase** – Gather influence.
7. **Bombardment Phase** – Move Dreadnought Fleet; pass first player token.

After phase 7, check for victory. If no winner, begin next round.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Influence Phase
- Draw top Influence card:
  - **Location card**: Place influence in two designated spaces (not under fleet).
  - **Temporary Ceasefire**: Only time alliances may form or break. Players may trade influence. Discard after use (reshuffle in rounds 1–3).
  - **Sol Offensive**: Destroy all units and influence in locations from previous Influence card. Sol and allies immune; may teleport units. Discard card.
- Announce round number (count influence-generating cards discarded).

### Bidding Phase
- Deal face-down Strategy cards equal to number of eligible bidders (not at hand limit).
- Hand limits: 4 for most, 8 for Letnev.
- First player starts bidding; minimum bid is 1 influence.
- Bidding proceeds clockwise. Players may raise or pass.
- Winner pays bid and takes card.
  - Lazax collects all bid influence (except own bids, paid to bank).
  - Letnev receives a second free card after winning a bid.
- If all pass on a card, phase ends; remaining cards reshuffled.

### Recruitment Phase
- In turn order, each player may recruit:
  - Up to 5 units total.
    - Free units per faction sheet.
    - Additional units cost 2 influence each.
  - 1 leader per turn, cost equal to leader’s strength.
- Lazax may recruit only 1 Mechanized unit per turn.
- "Fresh Recruits" card allows reviving 1 leader (no restrictions) or 5 normal units.

### Maneuvering Phase
- In turn order, each player performs:
  1. **Movement**: Move one group of units up to 2 spaces (connected by roads).
     - Sol: up to 3 spaces.
     - Controlling Navy Base or Spaceport: up to 4 spaces.
     - Cannot move into, out of, or through bombarded sectors.
  2. **Deployment**: Deploy units from reserve to one space.
     - 1 influence per unit if friendly/empty/Galactic Council.
     - 2 influence per unit if enemy-controlled.
     - Hacan receives payment; allies pay normal cost.
     - Sol: free deployment only to sectors 13–17.
- Cannot end movement or deploy in ally’s space (except Galactic Council).

### Battle Phase
- Occurs in any non-Galactic Council space with multiple players’ units.
- Resolve in turn order; each player resolves all their battles before next player.
- Steps:
  1. **Situation Report**: Declare units in space, Strategy cards in hand, leader strengths.
  2. **Choose Strength**: Secretly dial number of units to commit (0 to available).
  3. **Commit Leader**: Choose leader and card intent (attack, defense, both, or none).
  4. **Reveal Dials**: Simultaneously reveal.
  5. **Commit Cards**: Play required card(s); reveal simultaneously.
  6. **Reveal Traitor**: If holding Traitor card matching opponent’s leader, reveal to win immediately. Opponent loses units and leader; winner loses nothing.
     - If both reveal Traitor, both lose.
  7. **Resolve Cards**: In turn order, resolve effects (e.g., Energy Rifle kills leader unless shielded).
  8. **Determine Winner**: Total = dial + surviving leader strength. Higher wins; tie broken by turn order.
     - Loser destroys all units and discards played cards.
     - Winner destroys units equal to dial; may keep or discard cards.

### Collection Phase
1. **Charity**: Players with ≤2 influence gain 2 from bank.
   - Xxcha gains 2 regardless.
2. **Influence Collection**: Up to 2 influence per unit in controlled spaces with tokens.
   - Controlling Navy Base or Spaceport: up to 3 per unit.
   - Uncollected influence remains on board.

### Bombardment Phase
- First player draws Bombardment card; move Dreadnought Fleet that many sectors clockwise.
- Destroy all unshielded units and influence in sectors passed through and final sector.
- Final sector is under bombardment (blocks movement/deployment).
- Reshuffle card; pass first player token.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends when:
- A player or alliance controls enough strongholds, or
- Round 8 ends with no stronghold victory.

### Victory Conditions
- **Stronghold Victory**:
  - 1 player: controls 3 strongholds.
  - 2-player alliance: controls 4.
  - 3-player alliance: controls 5.
- **Sol Victory** (end of round 8):
  - No prior winner.
  - Sol or no player (not ally) controls Imperial Palace and Mecatol Power South.
- **Hacan Victory** (end of round 8):
  - No prior winner.
  - Hacan controls at least one of: Imperial Navy Base, Adminus Imperialis, or Civilian Spaceport.
- **Xxcha Victory**:
  - Xxcha’s secret prediction (player and round) is correct.
  - Xxcha wins alone, even in an alliance.

### Betrayal Cards (Optional)
- Only if an alliance wins.
- Any member may reveal Betrayal card if condition met (e.g., more units on board than allies).
- If multiple reveal, highest-numbered card wins.
- Xxcha victory cancels betrayal.

### Final Determination
1. Check stronghold victory.
2. If none, check Sol → then Hacan → then Xxcha.
3. If still no winner, player with most strongholds wins (ties share victory).

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Alliances**: Only form/break during Temporary Ceasefire. No co-location except Galactic Council.
- **Hacan**: Deployment payments go to Hacan; allies pay full cost.
- **Jol-Nar**: May peek at Influence card during Maneuvering; may force opponent to reveal battle plan element.
- **Xxcha**: May flip units face-down (do not control or battle); may deploy 1 free unit when others deploy.
- **Sol**: Immune to Sol Offensive; may teleport; may peek at Bombardment deck.
- **Letnev**: Keeps 4 Traitor cards; gains extra Strategy card per purchase.
- **Lazax**: Collects all bid influence; may capture leaders when winning battles.
- **Half Effects**: Rounded up unless specified (e.g., Sol takes half losses rounded down).
- **Timing**: Conflicts resolved in turn order. Xxcha’s command precedes Jol-Nar’s.
- **Secrets**: Cards and influence are private; discussions must be public.
