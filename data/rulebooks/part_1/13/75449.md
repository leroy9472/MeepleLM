## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Firenze*, players take on the role of master builders in 13th-century Florence, constructing colorful towers as symbols of prestige for noble families. The goal is to earn the most Prestige Points (PPs) by fulfilling construction commissions, completing special balcony projects, and leveraging strategic use of action cards. The game ends when one player places their final seal on the board, triggering final scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Step 1: Choose a Card  
- Select 1 of 6 face-up Action Cards.  
- Pay cost: 1 brick per card to the left (e.g., 3rd card costs 2 bricks).  
- Pay from Storehouse; place bricks on skipped cards.  
- Take selected card and all bricks on it → add bricks to Storehouse.  
- **Card Types**:  
  - **Event**: Resolve immediately, then discard.  
  - **Personnel**: Keep in hand; play on your turn.  
  - **Celebration**: Keep in hand; score at end. Cannot discard unless via Patrician.  
  - **Building**: Place face-up in front of you; permanent effect. Max 1 per type.  
  - **Church**: Place on Church space; stays until effect triggered.  

- After selection:  
  - Slide cards left to fill gap.  
  - Reveal new card from deck.  
  - Add 4 bricks from pouch (or all remaining if <4).  
  - If deck empty, shuffle discard pile into new deck.

#### Step 2: Exchange Bricks (Optional)  
- Once per turn:  
  - Pay 3 bricks from Storehouse to any card in Card Row.  
  - Take 1 brick of any color from that card.  
- **Ponte Vecchio** Building: allows 2:1 exchange instead of 3:1.

#### Step 3: Build Towers (Optional)  
- Use bricks from Storehouse to build/expand towers on Construction Site.  
- Rules:  
  - 1 brick = 1 level.  
  - Each tower is single color.  
  - May start new or extend existing towers.  
  - Max 6 bricks added per turn.  
  - Towers cannot be reduced.  
- **Construction Costs** (paid to pouch):  
  - 1–2 bricks: free  
  - 3 bricks: pay 1  
  - 4 bricks: pay 3  
  - 5 bricks: pay 6  
  - 6 bricks: pay 10  
- **Mason** (Personnel): reduces cost by 3 this turn.  
- **Workshop** (Building): reduces cost by 1 per build.  
  - With both: pay 4 less than normal (Mason effect enhanced).

#### Step 4: Tear Down Abandoned Constructions (Mandatory)  
- For each tower on Construction Site that existed at start of turn but was not built on:  
  - Return half (rounded up) of bricks to pouch.  
  - Return half (rounded down) to Storehouse.

#### Step 5: Fulfil Commissions (Optional)  
- May fulfil one or more commissions if:  
  - Commission not covered by seal.  
  - Balcony Commissions only in order (I → II → III → IV).  
- Requirements:  
  - Tower must match commission **exactly** in color and height.  
  - Use **Architect** to count tower as ±1 level (only during this phase).  
- Process:  
  1. Declare tower and commission.  
  2. Move PP marker by commission value.  
  3. Cover commission with your seal.  
  4. Return all bricks from tower to pouch.  
  5. If first to fulfil level 5/6/7/8, take corresponding Level Bonus Tile (+PP, then remove tile).  
  6. If Balcony Commission fulfilled, next in sequence unlocks.  
- Multiple commissions allowed per turn.

#### Step 6: Check Limits (Mandatory)  
- **Storehouse Limit**: max 10 bricks (or 15 with **Warehouse**).  
  - Excess returned to pouch (you choose which).  
- **Card Limit**: max 5 cards (Personnel + Celebration + Building cards).  
  - Excess must be discarded (cannot discard Celebration Cards unless using **Patrician**).  
  - If only Celebration Cards exceed limit, no discard required.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger**:  
- First player to place their **last seal** receives +5 PP and takes End of Game Tile.  
- All other players get **one final turn**.  

**Final Scoring**:  
1. **Majority Bonuses**:  
   - Each tower: player with most seals scores bonus (flag at top).  
   - Tie: bonus goes to tied player with **highest-level** commission (highest seal).  
2. **Celebration Cards**:  
   - Reveal all in hand; apply PP changes (positive or negative).  
3. **Total PPs**:  
   - Highest total wins.  
   - Tie: multiple winners.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use bricks on a card to pay for it?**  
  No. Must pay cost from Storehouse before taking card/bricks.  
- **Can I build a tower taller than a commission?**  
  Yes, but cannot fulfil commission until exact height. Use **Architect** to adjust.  
- **What if I can’t pay Luxury Tax?**  
  Destroy the tower. Half bricks (rounded up) to pouch, half to Storehouse.  
- **Can I discard Celebration Cards?**  
  Only via **Patrician** ability. Otherwise, immune to discard.  
- **What if two players tie for tallest tower with Monument?**  
  Discard the **Monument** card; no one scores it.  
- **Can I play multiple Personnel cards of different types?**  
  Yes, but only one of each name per turn.  
- **Can I have duplicate Building cards?**  
  No. If drawn, must discard immediately.  
- **Does Campanile block commissions before bell tower built?**  
  Yes. All players must build a 3-level white tower before fulfilling any commission.
