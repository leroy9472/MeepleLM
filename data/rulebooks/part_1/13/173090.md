## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
"The Game" is a cooperative card game where all players work together as a team. The objective is to play all 98 number cards (numbered 2–99) onto four central piles, two of which must be built in ascending order (1 → 99) and two in descending order (100 → 2). The team wins by successfully playing all cards. The fewer cards remaining when the game ends, the better the result.

2. Components  
- 98 number cards (featuring numbers 2 through 99)  
- 4 starting cards (implied: one for each pile — two ascending, two descending)  
- Game board or playmat showing four designated pile positions (two marked for ascending, two for descending)  
- Directional indicators (arrows) showing ascending and descending directions  

3. Setup  
- Place the four starting cards face-up in the center, arranged as:  
  - Two ascending piles (target: 1 → 99)  
  - Two descending piles (target: 100 → 2)  
- Shuffle the 98 number cards.  
- Deal cards based on player count:  
  - 1 player: 8 cards  
  - 2 players: 7 cards each  
  - 3–5 players: 6 cards each  
- Form a draw pile with the remaining cards, placed face-down beside the playing area.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise.  
- On your turn:  
  1. Play at least two cards (or one, if the draw pile is empty).  
     - You may play more than the minimum.  
     - Cards are played one at a time, to any of the four piles.  
  2. After playing, draw cards from the draw pile to refill your hand to the appropriate size:  
     - 6 cards (3–5 players)  
     - 7 cards (2 players)  
     - 8 cards (1 player)  
- When the draw pile is empty, players no longer draw cards. From this point, each player must play at least one card on their turn.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Pile Rules:  
  - Ascending piles: Each played card must be higher than the top card.  
  - Descending piles: Each played card must be lower than the top card.  
- Backwards Trick (Reverse Play):  
  - On an ascending pile, you may play a card exactly 10 **less** than the top card.  
    - Example: Play 37 on 47.  
  - On a descending pile, you may play a card exactly 10 **greater** than the top card.  
    - Example: Play 75 on 65.  
  - This trick can be used multiple times in a single turn, and on different piles.  
- Communication Rules:  
  - Players **must not** reveal or ask for exact card numbers.  
  - General hints are allowed:  
    - “Don’t play on this pile!”  
    - “Avoid high jumps here.”  
    - “Save low cards.”  
  - Any mention of specific numbers is forbidden.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when:  
  - A player cannot play the required minimum number of cards on their turn:  
    - 2 cards (if draw pile has cards)  
    - 1 card (if draw pile is empty)  
- Final score = total number of unplayed cards:  
  - Cards remaining in players’ hands  
  - Cards remaining in the draw pile (if any)  
- Scoring benchmarks:  
  - Less than 10 cards left = excellent  
  - 0 cards left (all 98 played) = victory; you beat the game  
- After winning, increase difficulty (see "For Experts").  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I play more than two cards even when the draw pile is full?  
  A: Yes. You may always play more than required.  

- Q: What happens if a player runs out of cards?  
  A: They stay in the game but take no further actions. Play continues with others.  

- Q: Can the backwards trick be used at any time?  
  A: Yes, as long as the 10-difference condition is met. It can be used multiple times per turn.  

- Q: Can I play a backwards trick on a pile that just had a backwards trick?  
  A: Yes. As long as the numerical condition is met, it’s valid.  

- Q: What if the draw pile runs out during a turn?  
  A: Complete your turn normally. On future turns, only one card must be played (minimum).  

- Q: Can I skip my turn?  
  A: No. You must play the minimum required cards if able. If you cannot, the game ends.  

- Q: Are piles built side-by-side or stacked?  
  A: Cards are stacked. Only the top card is visible.
