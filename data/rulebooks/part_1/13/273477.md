## Obscurio – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the abandoned Library, a powerful Grimoire holds the key to escape—but a dark Sorcerer seeks its return. Players take on the roles of Wizards fleeing the Library with the Grimoire, guided by its cryptic visual clues. However, one among them is a Traitor, secretly working to sabotage the group.  

**Objective**:  
- **Loyal Wizards & Grimoire**: Escape the Library by correctly identifying the Exit card in each of 6 Rooms. Victory is achieved if the Progress Marker reaches the final space and at least 1 Cohesion token remains.  
- **Traitor**: Prevent escape by causing the group to lose all Cohesion tokens.  

The Grimoire knows the Traitor’s identity but cannot speak—only guide through visual clues using Butterfly markers.

### 3. Setup  
**For 4–8 Players (Standard Game):**  

1. **Place the Board**: Position the game board in the center. Place the Progress Marker on the first space of the Progress Track.  
2. **Choose the Grimoire**: One player becomes the Grimoire. They receive:  
   - Desk  
   - Card Holder  
   - 2 Butterfly Markers  
   - Hourglass  
3. **Prepare Illusion Deck**: Shuffle the 84 Illusion Cards. The Grimoire draws 8 cards and places them face up in the Card Holder (others must not see them). Close the holder.  
4. **Assign Roles**:  
   - All other players are Wizards.  
   - Take 1 Traitor Loyalty Card and enough Loyal cards so that total equals the number of Wizards.  
   - Shuffle and deal one Loyalty Card to each Wizard. Each player views their card secretly.  
5. **Distribute Character Components**:  
   - Each Wizard takes a Character Card and matching-colored chip.  
   - Place all Wizard chips in the center of the board.  
6. **Prepare Trap Bag**: Place all 14 Trap Tokens into the bag.  
7. **Set Cohesion Tokens**:  
   - Choose difficulty: Beginner, Experienced, or Expert (see table).  
   - Total Cohesion Tokens = number based on player count and difficulty.  
   - Place all tokens on the left (light) area of the Cohesion gauge.  
   - Then move:  
     - 5 tokens to the dark (monster) area for 4–5 players  
     - 7 tokens to the dark area for 6–8 players  
   - Remaining tokens stay in the light area.  

> *Note: The dark area is the "danger zone"—losing all tokens here means Traitor victory.*

8. **Set Aside Extras**:  
   - Red and printed transparent sheets, Evanescent Room tile—used only when triggered by traps.  

Game is now ready to begin.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has 5 steps. The game continues until either the group escapes or loses all Cohesion tokens.

#### Step 1: Turn Setup  
- Draw 1 Trap Token from the bag.  
- Additional tokens may be drawn based on time used in the previous turn:  
  - Timer ended on +1 space → draw 1 extra  
  - Timer ended on +2 space → draw 2 extra  
- All drawn traps must be resolved this turn.  
- Traps affect different steps (see Core Mechanics).

#### Step 2: Prepare the Riddle  
- The Grimoire draws the top card from the deck—this is the **Exit Card** (keep face down, hidden from others).  
- Then draws 2 more Illusion Cards and places them face up on the Desk—these are the **Pages of the Grimoire**.  
- Using the 2 Butterfly Markers, the Grimoire points to:  
  - 1 or 2 elements on the Pages (cannot point both to same element)  
  - OR place a Butterfly at the bottom of a Page → indicates the **entire Page** is a clue (theme, color, mood).  
- Butterflies can be:  
  - On same Page or different Pages  
  - One on a Page, one at bottom  
- Once placed, Butterflies **cannot be moved**.  
- After placement, the Grimoire places the Exit Card face down and passes the Desk to the Wizards for discussion.  
- *Apply any Brown Traps now (they affect Step 2)*.

#### Step 3: Traitor Cards  
- All Wizards **close their eyes** (mandatory).  
- Grimoire instructs the **Traitor to open their eyes**.  
- Grimoire opens the Card Holder (showing the 8 face-up cards) to the Traitor only.  
- Traitor may choose:  
  - Up to 2 cards (by silently indicating card numbers 1–8)  
  - Each chosen card is removed and placed with the Exit Card  
  - Grimoire replaces each removed card with a new one from the deck  
- Traitor may choose **fewer than 2** or **none** (indicate by nodding).  
- Grimoire closes the Card Holder.  
- Traitor closes eyes.  
- Grimoire says “Open your eyes” — all resume.  
- *Apply Purple Traps now (they affect Step 3)*.

#### Step 4: Choosing the Door  
- Grimoire collects:  
  - Exit Card  
  - Any cards chosen by Traitor  
  - Adds cards from deck until **6 total** (Green Traps may alter this number)  
- Shuffles all 6 cards and places them face up on the board in door slots #1–6.  
- **As soon as the first card is placed**, start the hourglass and place it on the first space of the Time Track.  
  - When it runs out, flip and move to next space.  
  - Max: 3 spaces (+0, +1, +2).  
- Wizards **discuss** which card matches the clues (Traitor may mislead).  
- Each Wizard places their **Character chip** in front of a door they believe is correct.  
  - Can change mind during discussion.  
  - May choose different doors.  
- Step ends when:  
  - All chips are placed and group agrees → stop timer  
  - OR hourglass runs out on +2 space → Grimoire says “Stop!”  
    - Any Wizard without a chip is treated as choosing wrong door  

**Resolution**:  
- Grimoire reveals the Exit Card.  
- **If at least one chip is on the correct door**:  
  - Move Progress Marker forward one space.  
  - If it reaches the final space, **the Watcher Trap activates** for all future turns.  
- **If no chip on correct door**:  
  - Progress Marker **does not move**.  
- **Penalty**:  
  - Each Wizard with chip on wrong door (or no chip) takes **1 Cohesion Token** from the board:  
    - First from left (light) area  
    - When empty, from dark (monster) area  
  - Place token on their Character Card (tracks individual errors).  
- **If last Cohesion Token is taken from the board** → Traitor wins immediately.  

*Apply Green Traps now (they affect Step 4)*.

#### Step 5: End of the Turn  
- Discard all used Illusion Cards face up beside the board.  
- Return all Trap Tokens to the bag.  
- Return all Wizard chips to the center of the board.  
- Proceed to next turn (Step 1).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Trap Tokens  
Each trap affects a specific step:

**Brown Traps (Step 2 – Prepare the Riddle)**  
- **+2**: Draw 2 extra Trap Tokens  
- **Dark Night**: Discard Pages and Butterflies at start of Step 3  
- **Dusk Hallway (Red Filter)**: Place red sheet over Pages before placing Butterflies  
- **United Butterflies**: Both Butterflies must be on or below the **same** Page  
- **Magical Mist**: Place printed sheet over Pages; cannot point to elements on the sheet  
- **Bottom Butterfly**: At least one Butterfly must be at the bottom of a Page  

**Purple Traps (Step 3 – Traitor Cards)**  
- **Dark Magic**: Traitor may choose up to **4 cards** (instead of 2)  
- **Espionage**: Grimoire must show the **Exit Card** to the Traitor before they choose cards  

**Green Traps (Step 4 – Choosing the Door)**  
- **Concealed Door**: Door #4 card is **not revealed** until end of step  
- **Evanescent Room**: Replace Time Track with Evanescent Room tile (alters timing rules)  
- **Great Room**: Add **7th door** (Grimoire adds 1 extra card)  
- **Dangerous Room**: Remove **1 Cohesion Token per wrong door chosen** (from board to box)  
- **Locked Doors**: Reveal cards **one by one**. After each reveal, Wizards not yet placed must decide immediately whether to choose it. Once passed, cannot choose later.  

**Special Trap: The Watcher**  
- Not a token. Activates when Progress Marker reaches final space.  
- **Effect**:  
  - Wizards **cannot communicate** in any way  
  - When Choosing the Door:  
    - Each Wizard holds their chip secretly  
    - After all have decided, someone counts to 3  
    - All **simultaneously place** their chips  

**No Effect**: Does nothing.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

**Victory Conditions**:  
- **Wizards & Grimoire Win**:  
  - Progress Marker reaches final space (6th Room)  
  - AND at least 1 Cohesion Token remains on the board  
- **Traitor Wins**:  
  - All Cohesion Tokens are removed from the board (dark area emptied)  

**Accusation Phase** (Triggered when last token is taken from light area):  
- Begins immediately after Step 4 when last light-area token is taken.  
- Grimoire does **not participate**.  
- Steps:  
  1. Turn hourglass (1-minute discussion)  
  2. On count of 3, all Wizards **simultaneously point** to suspected Traitor  
  3. Player(s) with most votes are **accused** and reveal Loyalty Card  
  4. **If Loyal player falsely accused**: Lose 2 Cohesion Tokens (from board to box)  
  5. **If Traitor not exposed** and tokens remain → repeat Accusation Phase  
  6. **If Traitor exposed**:  
     - Traitor reveals card  
     - Removed from future discussions (except Step 3)  
     - Game continues if Cohesion remains  

> *Note: If Accusation Phase causes last Cohesion Token to be removed, Traitor wins.*

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can Grimoire gesture or make sounds?**  
  → No. Only visual clues via Butterflies. Any verbal or physical hinting is against rules.  

- **What if all 8 cards in Card Holder are used by Traitor over time?**  
  → Grimoire replaces each removed card immediately. Deck is reshuffled if needed.  

- **Can two Butterflies point to same card but different elements?**  
  → Yes, as long as not the **same element**.  

- **What happens if Traitor is exposed early?**  
  → They stop participating in discussions. Only help choose Traitor cards in Step 3.  

- **Can a Wizard choose no door?**  
  → Yes, but treated as wrong choice — lose 1 Cohesion Token.  

- **What if tie in Accusation Phase?**  
  → All tied players are accused and reveal cards.  

- **Can Grimoire see the Exit Card after placing Butterflies?**  
  → Yes, until Step 2 ends. But must keep it hidden.
