## Shanghai Zendo

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Shanghai Zendo is a variant of Zendo for 3–5 players where all participants are equal—there is no designated Master or Moderator. Instead, each player privately defines four personal "Buddha Natures" (secret aesthetic preferences or structural rules). The goal is to collect or build koans (pyramid arrangements) that satisfy three out of the player’s four Buddha Natures, excluding the one corresponding to the current wind direction. Victory is achieved when a player owns such a set of koans after their turn.

### 2. Components  
- **60 Icehouse pyramids**: Four colors, each with 5 small, 5 medium, and 5 large pieces.  
- **Markers**: Colored "flattened marbles" (or similar), one unique color per player, to denote koan ownership.  
- **Money**: A supply of tokens (e.g., poker chips), 12 units per player.  
- **The Well**: A small container (e.g., coffee mug) used to hold money during play.  
- **Compass Rose**: A representation of the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) to track wind direction.  
- **Flat playing surface**: Large enough for group seating and koan construction (e.g., dining table size).  
- **Paper and pencil**: One set per player for recording Buddha Natures.

### 3. Setup  
1. Players sit around the table with the pyramid box, The Well, and Compass Rose in the center.  
2. Each player receives 12 units of money.  
3. Players agree on one of the two **Auction Options** (Traditional or Zen) to use for the entire game.  
4. Each player secretly writes down four Buddha Natures and assigns one to each direction (North, East, South, West). These must remain hidden.  
5. Determine the initial wind direction randomly (e.g., via two coin flips).  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Turns proceed clockwise, starting with the oldest player.  
- On a player’s turn:  
  1. **(Optional) Build a koan** and mark it with their marker.  
  2. **Offer a koan for auction**: The player must offer one of their koans for sale (if they just built one, it must be that one).  
     - Conduct the auction using the pre-agreed format (Traditional or Zen).  
- After the auction:  
  - If a player meets the **win condition**, they may declare victory.  
  - The **second-highest bidder** (if any) may either:  
    - Remove 1 unit from The Well (if non-empty), or  
    - Rotate the wind direction by one cardinal point (e.g., North → East or West, but not to South).  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Auction Options  
**Traditional Auction**:  
- The auctioneer sets a minimum bid (≥1).  
- If no one accepts, they lower the bid and repeat.  
- Once a bid is accepted, they solicit higher bids.  
- The highest bidder wins.  
- The auctioneer manages tie-breaking and bidding flow.  

**Zen Auction**:  
- All players secretly place a bid in one hand (0 allowed, but cannot win).  
- On signal, all reveal bids.  
- The highest **non-tied** bid wins.  
- The second-highest **non-tied** bid determines the second-highest bidder.  
- If no unique winner (all non-zero bids are tied), the seller keeps the koan and:  
  - Pays 1 unit to The Well (if they have money), or  
  - If they have no money, they keep the koan and the second-highest bidder acts as normal.  

#### General Auction Rules  
- The auctioneer may bid but must retain at least 1 unit of money after bidding (to pay The Well if they win).  
- The buyer pays the seller directly.  
- If no one bids at least 1 unit, the owner keeps the koan and pays 1 unit to The Well.  
- Bids must be non-negative integers and cannot exceed a player’s current money.  
- Ownership change is marked by replacing the koan’s marker with the new owner’s color.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### How to Win  
After the auction and any wind adjustment, a player may claim victory if they own:  
- **One koan** that satisfies **all three** of their Buddha Natures **not** associated with the current wind direction, **or**  
- **Three koans**, each satisfying **one** of those three Buddha Natures (no overlap).  

The Buddha Nature matching the current wind direction is **ignored**.  
The player reveals their four Buddha Natures and demonstrates how the win condition is met. The game ends immediately.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a player win without building a koan on their turn?**  
  Yes. If they already meet the win condition after the previous turn’s auction and wind change, they may declare victory at the start of their turn.  
- **What happens if the Well is empty and the second-highest bidder chooses to take money?**  
  They simply do nothing—the option has no effect.  
- **Can a player bid zero in the Traditional auction?**  
  No. Minimum bid is 1.  
- **Can a player win by buying a koan that completes their set?**  
  Yes, as long as the win condition is met **after** the auction and wind change.  
- **What if the second-highest bidder is the same as the highest?**  
  Only applies in Zen Auction: tied bids are ignored. The second-highest bidder is the highest non-tied bid below the winner.
