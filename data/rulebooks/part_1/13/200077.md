## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Mint Works*, players are neighborhood planners in the city of Mintopia, competing to create the finest neighborhood by constructing buildings and managing mint tokens (currency). The goal is to score the most stars (☆) from buildings in your neighborhood. The game emphasizes efficient worker placement, strategic planning, and resource management.

2. Components  
- 30 Mint Tokens (①)  
- 33 Cards:  
  - 10 Location Cards (4 Core, 2 Deed, up to 2 Advanced or Promo)  
  - 21 Plan Cards  
  - 2 AI Cards (for solo mode)  
- Starting Player Token ("Fresh breath" token)  
- Deed Tokens (included in promo/expansion)  

3. Setup  
- Place the 4 Core Locations on the table, showing the side matching player count.  
- Place the 2 Deed Locations (Lotto, Wholesaler) adjacent, initially closed (closed side up).  
- Optional: Add 2 randomly selected Advanced Locations.  
- Shuffle all Plan Cards to form the Plan Deck.  
- Reveal 3 Plans face up to form the Plan Supply.  
- Place Mint Tokens in a supply near the board.  
- Each player receives 3 Mints (①).  
- The player with the “freshest breath” takes the Starting Player Token.  

For Solo Mode:  
- Use one AI opponent.  
- Locations are arranged: Producer, Wholesaler, Builder, Supplier, Leadership Council, Lotto (+ optional Advanced).  
- Plan Supply starts with 2 face-up Plans.  
- AI receives starting Mints per its AI card.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of two phases:  
1. **Development Phase**  
   - Players take turns in clockwise order, starting with the Starting Player.  
   - On a turn, a player may:  
     - **Place**: Put the required number of Mints (①) on an unoccupied space of a Location to use its action.  
     - **Pass**: End their turn; they may no longer act this phase.  
   - The phase ends when all players pass consecutively.  

2. **Upkeep Phase**  
   - **End Game Check**: If any player has 7 or more ① from Building Upkeep effects, trigger final scoring.  
   - **Refill Plan Supply**: Replace face-up Plans to maintain 3. If unable, end the game.  
   - **Resolve Upkeep Effects**:  
     - Activate all "Upkeep" abilities on Buildings in players’ neighborhoods.  
     - Deed Location owners gain ① if Mints are on their Location.  
   - Return all Mints from Locations to the supply.  
   - Each player gains 1 Mint (①).  
   - Next Development Phase begins.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Neighborhood**: Area in front of a player containing their Plans, Buildings, and Mints.  
- **Plan**: Face-down card in a player’s neighborhood; becomes a **Building** when built.  
- **Gain**: Take a card or Mint from the supply into your neighborhood.  
- **Lose**: Return a Plan to the bottom of the Plan Deck; return any associated Mints.  
- **Deed Locations**: When a player builds Wholesaler or Lotto, they “own” the matching Location, flipping it to open. Owner gains ① during Upkeep if Mints are on it.  
- **Worker Placement**: Players place Mints on Locations to trigger actions. Each space may be used only once per Development Phase.  

**Location Actions**:  
- **Producer**: Gain ①①  
- **Wholesaler**: Same as Producer; owner gains ① during Upkeep if occupied  
- **Builder**: Build one Plan (turn face-up)  
- **Supplier**: Gain a Plan from supply; cost = Plan’s ① cost  
- **Leadership Council**: Gain ① and Starting Player Token  
- **Lotto**: Gain top Plan from deck (kept hidden); owner gains ① during Upkeep if occupied  
- **Crowdfunder**: Gain ①①①; each other player gains ①  
- **Recycler**: Return any Plan/Building to bottom of deck; gain ① equal to its cost + star value  
- **Swap Meet**: Swap any Plan/Building from hand with one in supply  
- **Temp Agency**: Use another Location’s action; cost = 1 + that Location’s mint cost  
- **Advanced/Promo Locations**: e.g., Thrift Store (custom), included optionally  

**Building Effects (Upkeep)**:  
- **Assembler**: Automatically build Plans bought from Supplier  
- **Bridge**: Counts as 2 Buildings for scoring and effects  
- **Co-op**: Gain ①; choose another player to gain ①  
- **Corporate HQ**: Gain ① per Building in neighborhood  
- **Crane**: Pay 1 less ① when building (min 1)  
- **Gallery**: Gain ① and place it on Gallery; Gallery’s ☆ = number of ① on it  
- **Museum**: ☆ = number of Buildings  
- **Obelisk**: ☆ = number of Buildings  
- **Truck**: Pay 1 less ① when buying Plans (min ①1)  
- **Vault**: ☆ = 2 × number of face-down Plans  
- **Landfill**: Each Building in neighborhood produces 1 less ① (min 0)  
- **Mine, Plant, Workshop, Stripmine, Factory**: Gain ① during Upkeep  

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when:  
- Any player has 7 or more ① from Building Upkeep effects, OR  
- The Plan Supply cannot be refilled to 3 during Upkeep.  

**Scoring**:  
- Each player totals ☆ from all Buildings in their neighborhood.  
- Highest ☆ wins.  

**Tiebreakers** (in order):  
1. Fewest total cards in neighborhood (Buildings + Plans)  
2. Most Mints (①)  
3. Age closest to 42  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you place on a Location with no available spaces?** No. Only unoccupied spaces may be used.  
- **Can you use Temp Agency on a Location with no spaces occupied?** No. The targeted Location must have at least one Mint on it.  
- **What happens if the Plan Deck runs out?** When refilling the Plan Supply fails to reach 3 cards, the game ends.  
- **Can you build a Plan immediately after gaining it?** Yes, on a future turn, if you have not passed.  
- **Does Bridge count as 2 for Vault?** No. Vault counts face-down *Plans*, and Bridge is a Building.  
- **Can you use Recycler or Swap Meet on a Deed?** Yes, unless restricted. Building a Deed only grants ownership; the card itself can be recycled/swapped.  
- **Solo Mode – AI Plan replacement**: When AI takes a Plan from Supplier and no effect replaces it, immediately draw a new one.  
- **AI Behavior**:  
  - Always uses first available Location in order: Producer → Wholesaler → Builder → Supplier → LC → Lotto → Advanced  
  - Builds oldest (first acquired) Plan first  
  - Buys Plans by: lowest cost → type priority → closest to deck
