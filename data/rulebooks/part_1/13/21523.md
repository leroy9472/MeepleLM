## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
This cooperative variant transforms Runebound into a party-based adventure where players travel together to defeat High Lord Margath before he unleashes destruction on Terrinoth. The goal is to locate Margath’s lair—either through defeating a red challenge in the forest (Variant #1) or discovering a magical portal using five pieces of ancient knowledge (Variant #2)—then defeat a Guardian and Margath in succession. Victory is achieved by completing this quest before the Threat Track reaches 10. If the Threat Track reaches 10, an End Game begins: heroes have four turns to defeat two of Margath’s generals and then Margath himself, whose health is increased by 50%. Failure occurs if all heroes are knocked out at any time.

2. Components  
- Runebound 2nd Edition base game  
- Expansions (optional, depending on variant)  
- Threat Track (printable or from Midnight expansion)  
- Combat Sheet (included in variant rules)  
- Ally Markers and Monster Markers (printable sheets)  
- Portal Tokens (6 tokens: 1 portal, 5 knowledge pieces)  
- Doom Counters  
- Experience and Life Counters  
- Movement Dice (5 per player)

3. Setup  
- Set up the board as in standard Runebound, with these changes:  
  - For Variant #1 (Mountains of Despair): Remove the red adventure jewel from the Mountains of Despair space. Keep the High Lord Margath card separate.  
  - For Variant #2 (Magical Portal): Place six face-down portal tokens next to the six red adventure jewels near the board's outskirts (excluding the forest space above Forge). One token represents the portal; five represent ancient knowledge.  
- Use a single party marker (e.g., a penny) to represent the group on the board; place it in Tamalir.  
- Prepare the Threat Track: set Threat Level to 0, Threat Difficulty to 20 (reduces by 1 each time the highest-level hero gains a level, minimum 12), and Threat Pool to 0 with 5 doom counters.  
- Print and prepare: Combat Sheet, Ally Markers (one pair per player), Monster Markers (place by pairs beside board).  
- Optionally use Random Starting Cities: assign numbers 1–8 to cities; roll d8 to determine starting city (re-roll 9–10).  
- Market Setup: Use four decks—Armor/Weapons, Artifacts, Runes/Rituals, Allies/Familiars. Seed each city market with one face-up card drawn randomly (d10: 1–3 Armor/Weapons, 4–5 Artifacts, 6–7 Runes/Rituals, 8–10 Allies/Familiars).

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn, the party follows the sequence:  
1. Refresh  
2. Movement  
3. Adventure  
4. Market  
5. Experience  
6. Threat Roll (end of turn)  

All steps are performed as a group. Movement uses a single party marker. The party may travel as a unit or individually (players may switch between modes). When traveling individually, heroes take separate turns but may act simultaneously. When in the same location, they may interact as a party.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Threat Roll (Step 6)**: After Experience, roll 2d10 and add doom counters in the pool. If total ≥ Threat Difficulty or no doom counters remain, increase Threat Level by 1, reset doom pool to 0, and check triggers:  
  - At levels 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9: draw an Event card (color based on highest challenge defeated; Green if none)  
  - At levels 3, 6, 8: replenish all depleted starburst adventure jewels  
  - At level 10: trigger End Game  
- **Movement**: Party moves together using a single marker. Roll movement dice (5 normally, 4 if any wound/exhaustion present). May move 1 space without rolling. Unused dice with 3 symbols may remove exhaustion (1 per die).  
- **Adventure**: Draw card from deck matching current gem color.  
  - *Challenges*: All participating heroes face challenge in parallel. Damage is cumulative. Life values: Green = printed, Yellow = +1, Blue = +2, Red = +3 (optional rule).  
  - *Encounters*: Party chooses one hero to resolve.  
  - *Events*: Resolved as in base game; may trigger Threat Track effects.  
- **Market**: In a city, draw one card per hero from each of four decks (via d10 roll). Heroes may visit shops; reveal 2 + (number of extra heroes) cards per shop. Buy/sell items, heal (1 gold removes 2 wounds or all exhaustion per hero/ally), rest.  
- **Experience**: Cost to level up = next level number (2XP to reach level 2, 3XP for level 3, etc.). Must spend XP same turn it’s earned to reduce Threat Difficulty.  
- **Combat**:  
  - Use Combat Sheet with Terrain Levels (1–3). Heroes/Allies start on Levels 1–2 (unused); monsters on 2–3.  
  - Combat Round Order: Escape → Initiative (1d10, lower wins) → Ranged → Melee → Magic → Move  
  - Only one action per character per round (attack or move). Defending is free.  
  - Attacks of Opportunity: Ranged/Magic attacks against adjacent enemies provoke free melee attacks at -4.  
  - Group Advantage: Hero may take -2 on a check to give +1 to another hero/ally on same check type.  
  - Knockouts: KO’d hero discards most expensive item, loses 1 max life (restorable via XP). Party KO occurs only if all heroes KO and all allies dead.  
- **Portal Investigation (Variant #2)**:  
  - Defeat challenge within 2 spaces: test MIND [Sneak] or BODY [Endure] (15)  
  - Move through/stop on token space: test MIND [Spot] or BODY [Climb] (15)  
  - Market step within 4 spaces: pay 3 gold, test SPIRIT [Diplomacy] (15)  
  - Success reveals token; failure gives 2 exhaustion (all heroes)  
- **Entering Lair (Variant #2)**: At portal, pass three sequential tests (MIND [Spot/Tinker] 16, BODY [Endure/Jump] 16, SPIRIT [Lore/Resist] 16). Failed test: retry next turn or take 2 exhaustion to retry immediately.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Victory:  
  - *Final Battle*: Enter lair before Threat Level 10 → defeat random Red Challenge (Guardian), then Margath in succession.  
  - *End Game*: Threat Level reaches 10 → heroes have 4 turns to defeat two Red Challenges (generals), then Margath (health = 12).  
- Defeat:  
  - All heroes knocked out during any combat.  
  - Threat Level reaches 10 and heroes fail to defeat Margath within 4 turns.  
- **Dragon Fear**: Before fighting Margath, each party member tests MIND [Hide] (15), BODY [Endure] (15), or SPIRIT [Resist] (15). Failure = -2 to all combat rolls.  
- **Threat Track Triggers**:  
  - Level 10: End Game begins  
  - Level 3/6/8: Replenish starburst jewels  
  - Level 1/2/3/5/7/9: Draw Event card

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Ties in Party Decisions**: Party leader (rotating or designated) breaks ties.  
- **Multiple Encounters**: Only one encounter per hero per turn. Excess encounters set aside; resolve after challenge, then shuffle back.  
- **Escaping as Party**: At least one escaping hero must succeed; others who fail take 1 damage. Escapers get no rewards.  
- **Healing**: 1 gold removes 2 wounds from one hero/ally, or all exhaustion.  
- **Allies**: May be improved (optional): gain XP (½ challenge reward), level up (cost: 2,3,4 XP), gain experience counters (+1 Mind/Body/Spirit/Life/Stamina per level). Max 2 life counters per ally.  
- **Backpack Rule**: Each hero has a hidden backpack (1 weapon or armor). Can swap freely outside combat.  
- **Combat Resolution Variant**: After defeating challenge, resolve next phase. If KO’d, treated as “critically injured” — conscious, keeps rewards, but must heal before next challenge.
