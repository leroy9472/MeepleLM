# Automobiles – Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective  
Automobiles is a racing strategy game where players build and customize their car's performance using a bag-building mechanic. Players use colored cubes representing different car systems (gears, wear, and power) to move around a track, manage wear, and optimize their engine configuration. The goal is to be the first to cross the finish line after all players have had an equal number of turns.

Optional expansions introduce advanced mechanics such as Fuel Mixture cards and solo play with AI opponents.

## 2. Components  
- Game board with track (multiple sides for different circuits)  
- Player cars (colored)  
- Colored cubes:  
  - White (W) – White gear  
  - Light Gray (LG) – Light gray gear  
  - Dark Gray (DG) – Dark gray gear  
  - Black (B) – Black gear  
  - Yellow (Y) – Power  
  - Red (R), Green (G), Purple (P), Blue (BL) – Power/action cubes  
- Wear cubes (used to track engine degradation)  
- Lap markers  
- Player boards  
- Cube bags  
- Action cards (e.g., Manager, Crew Chief, Suspension, Gearbox, Hybrid Engine)  
- Fuel Mixture cards (expansion)  
- Mechanic cards (solo expansion)  
- Movement track (solo play)  

## 3. Setup  
1. **Choose Board Side**: Select a track (e.g., Daytona Beach for beginners).  
2. **Place Action Cards**:  
   - Draw 1 random card for each color cube and place next to "cube stock".  
   - Do the same for Wear and Gear cubes (first game: Manager, Crew Chief, Suspension, Gearbox, Hybrid Engine).  
3. **Starting Player & Car Placement**:  
   - Choose starting player.  
   - Place cars on starting line in player order.  
   - Set lap markers to 3 (standard) or 7 (solo 7-lap race).  
4. **Player Preparation**:  
   - Each player takes a player board.  
   - Place 2 light gray, 5 white, and 5 yellow cubes in bag.  
5. **Initial Purchase**:  
   - Buy cubes equal to the value of the starting space (based on starting position).  
   - Place purchased cubes in bag.  
6. **Draw Initial Hand**:  
   - Draw 7 cubes into active area.  
7. **Optional Expansions**:  
   - **Fuel Mixture Cards**: Shuffle and draft one per player (see Expansion Setup).  
   - **Solo Play**: Set up opponent movement track, place neutral cars, assign lap markers, and prepare mechanic/driver cards.

## 4. Gameplay Flow  
On each turn, a player chooses either a **Standard Turn (Race)** or an **Alternative Turn (Pit Stop)**.

### Standard Turn (Race)

#### Action Phase  
- Play cubes from your active area **in top-to-bottom order** for their full effect.  
- If a cube requires taking a Wear cube but none are available, the action cannot be used.  
- All cubes used go to the **used area**.  
- **Track Movement Rules**:  
  - Bold lines separate spaces; multiple segments allow multiple cars per space.  
  - Movement must be adjacent (diagonal is allowed); no backward or sideways movement.  
  - Cannot move into an occupied segment.  
  - Use cubes on the board to mark movement progress.  
  - Cubes placed on the board are considered **used**.

#### Buy Phase  
- Unused cubes in active area may be spent at **$5 each** (virtual money).  
- Money does **not carry over** — use it or lose it.  
- Buy any cubes (including multiples), limited by stock.  
- Purchased cubes go to **used pile**.

#### Car Phase  
- Move your car to the position of your **furthest cube** on the track.  
- If car passes finish line, advance lap marker.  
- If lap marker reaches "Finish", finish current round (equal turns), then end game.

#### Decline Phase  
- Gain **Wear cubes** equal to the highest color track space used this turn (refer to Wear chart).  
- **Exception**: If you did **not move**, gain **no Wear**.  
- **Drafting Bonus**: If you end your turn directly behind another car (drafting), gain **no Wear**.

#### End Phase  
- Move **all cubes** (active area, used pile, board) to **discard pile**.  
- Draw 7 new cubes for next turn.  
- If bag is empty, refill from discard, shuffle, then draw.  
- **Scoot cars forward** in shared spaces to fill gaps.

### Alternative Turn (Pit Stop)  
- Instead of a Standard Turn:  
  - Return **all Wear cubes** from active area to stock.  
  - Move all other cubes in active area to **discard pile**.  
  - Draw 7 new cubes for next turn.  
- **Limitation**: Only one free Pit Stop per lap (in solo play); in multiplayer, standard rules apply unless modified.

## 5. Core Mechanics  

### Cube Movement  
- Cubes placed on the track represent movement.  
- Car moves to the **furthest cube** played.  
- Multiple cubes can be used to plan movement paths.

### Wear Management  
- Wear is gained in the **Decline Phase** based on highest-color space used.  
- Drafting prevents Wear gain.  
- Wear cubes must be available in supply; if not, opponent movement is affected (solo).

### Fuel Mixture Cards (Expansion)  
- **Setup**: Draft one card per player before race.  
- **Action Phase**:  
  - Spend cubes (on left side of card) to gain immediate benefits (right side).  
  - Must be able to **perform full benefit**.  
  - Benefits may include movement, drawing cubes, returning cubes, or special actions.  
  - **Important**: Movement via Fuel Mixture **does not generate Wear**.  
- **End Phase**:  
  - If car crosses finish line (completes lap), **remove all cubes from Fuel Mixture card** and place in discard.  
  - If not, cubes **remain on card** (locked).  
- Cubes on Fuel Mixture card are **not in play, bag, or discard** — they are isolated.

### Solo Play Rules  
- **Opponent Movement**:  
  - Opponents use a **movement track** with cubes drawn randomly.  
  - Movement depends on race phase:  
    - **Early Race** (first 3–5 laps): Move primarily on **light gray** spaces.  
    - **Late Race** (final 2 laps): Move on **dark gray** spaces.  
  - **Movement Modifiers**:  
    - Advance opponent cubes if:  
      - You are ahead of them.  
      - You have lapped them.  
      - You have 1–2 blue cubes → +1 space; 3–4 blue cubes → +2 spaces.  
      - You failed to gain Wear → opponents moving after you gain +1 space.  
- **Free Pit Stop**: One per lap (remove all Wear, redraw 7 cubes).  
- **Mechanics**: After each race, choose a mechanic based on finish position (1st, mid, last) to modify bag composition.  
- **Scoring**: Based on race finish, bag composition, and lapped cars.

## 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when **first player crosses finish line**.  
- Complete the current round so all players have equal turns.  
- **Winner**:  
  - Furthest along the track wins.  
  - Tiebreaker: Innermost lane wins.

### Solo/Multi Scoring (Series)  
- **Race Finish**:  
  - 1st: 3 + race number (e.g., 4 points for Race 1)  
  - 2nd–4th: 3 points  
  - Last: 2 points (1 if didn’t finish same turn as last neutral)  
- **Lapped Cars**: 1 point per car lapped (after all turns).  
- **Bag Scoring** (after hiring mechanic):  
  - No Wear: +1  
  - No Blue cubes: +1 (only if not last)  
  - No Black gear cubes: +1 (only if not last)  
  - 3+ White cubes: +1 (only if not last)  
- **Season Rating** (after 5 races):  
  - <21: Did Not Qualify  
  - 21–23: Rookie  
  - 24–26: Up and Comer  
  - 27–29: Top 10 Racer  
  - 30–32: Top 5 Racer  
  - 33+: Season Series Champion

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use a cube partially?**  
  No. Must use full effect or skip.  
- **What if I run out of cubes?**  
  Refill bag from discard, shuffle, then draw.  
- **Can I move through occupied spaces?**  
  No. Cannot enter an occupied segment. Use adjacent/diagonal paths.  
- **Fuel Mixture Cubes**: Are they in my bag?  
  No. They are locked on the card until you complete a lap.  
- **Solo: What if I can’t gain Wear?**  
  Opponents moving after you gain +1 movement space.  
- **Tie in movement?**  
  Use innermost lane to break tie.  
- **Can I use Fuel Mixture to move past finish line?**  
  Yes. If you cross, remove cubes from card at End Phase.  
- **Can I draft and still gain Wear?**  
  No. Drafting prevents Wear gain.  
- **Can I use multiple Fuel Mixture combos in one turn?**  
  Yes, as long as you can perform each full benefit.
