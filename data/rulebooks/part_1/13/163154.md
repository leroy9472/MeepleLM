## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
*Falling Sky* is a strategy board game set during Julius Caesar’s Gallic Wars, where players control factions (Romans, Arverni, Belgic, Aedui, or Germanic) vying for dominance in ancient Gaul. Each faction has unique victory conditions based on military strength, territorial control, and political influence.

**Victory Conditions (Final Tally in Winter Phase):**
- **Romans:** Subdued + Dispersed + Allied Tribes > 15
- **Arverni:** Off-map Legions destroyed > 6 **and** Arverni Allies + Citadels > 8
- **Belgic:** Belgic Control Value + Allied Tribes + Citadels > 15
- **Aedui:** Aedui Allies + Citadels > each other faction’s total
- **Germanic:** Non-player faction; cannot win

Closest to goal wins if no one meets their condition.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Turn order follows a seasonal structure:

#### **Winter Phase (executed by all players):**
1. **Victory Phase:** Check victory conditions (only 1–3 player games use special rules).
2. **Germans Phase:**
   - RALLY → MARCH → RAID → BATTLE+AMBUSH → Adjust Control
3. **Quarters Phase:** Transfer resources between regions.
4. **Harvest Phase:** Transfer additional resources.

Then proceed to next year.

Each faction takes turns during active phases using **Commands** in this order:
- RECRUIT / RALLY
- MARCH
- RAID
- BATTLE (+ AMBUSH if eligible)
- Adjust Control

Commands may include Special Abilities.

#### **Ambush Rules:**
- Triggered when attacker has more **hidden units** than defender.
- Only factions with Ambush ability may use it (all non-Roman factions).
- **Romans cannot ambush.**
- **Germans must ambush** if they have more hidden units; **cannot attack normally** if fewer.
- Ambushed units **cannot retreat or counterattack**.
- **Defenders against Germans are always ambushed** (automatic).
- **Caesar Escape:** If Caesar is ambushed:
  - Roll 5–6 vs Belgae
  - Roll 4–6 vs others
  - Success = avoids ambush (can retreat and counterattack).

#### **Retreat Rules:**
- Retreating units move to adjacent region controlled by same or allied faction.
- Controller of destination must allow entry.
- Retreating forces **lose Allies, Citadels, Forts first**.
- If no valid retreat path, must fight.

#### **Loss Resolution:**
- **Inflicted Damage:**
  - Warband, Auxilia: ½ loss
  - Leader, Legion: 1 loss
  - Legion with Caesar: 2 losses
  - Belgic Warband with Ambiorix: 1 loss
- **Halving of Losses:**
  - Occurs if defender retreats **or** has Fort/Citadel.
  - Does **not apply to counterattack losses**.
- **Loss Application:**
  - 1 Damage = remove 1 Warband, Auxilia, or Ally
  - For Legions, Leaders, Forts, Citadels: roll 1–3 to remove (automatic if ambushed)
- **Besiege (Roman Special Ability):**
  - Before inflicting losses in battle, attacker may remove 1 defending Ally or Citadel.
  - Citadel still halves losses even after removal option.

#### **Harassment:**
- Occurs when moving through regions with hidden enemy units.
- **Gauls may cause losses:** 1 loss per 3 hidden Warbands (round down).
- **Germans always cause losses.**
- Losses: remove 1 Auxilia, OR roll 1–3 to lose Legion/Leader/Fort.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can Caesar retreat from ambush?**  
  Yes, on die roll: 5–6 vs Belgae, 4–6 vs others.

- **Do Citadels/Forts halve losses during counterattacks?**  
  No. Counterattack losses are never halved.

- **What happens if a unit cannot retreat?**  
  It must stay and fight; no forced elimination unless defeated in battle.

- **Can you use Special Abilities outside their listed Commands?**  
  No. Each SA is tied to a specific command (e.g., Besiege only during Battle).

- **Are Dispersed Tribes counted for victory?**  
  Yes — Romans count them in their total (Subdued + Dispersed + Allied).

- **Can Allies be placed in Devastated regions?**  
  No — RALLY and RECRUIT cannot be used in Devastated regions (unless with leader like Vercingetorix).

- **Does Ambush prevent all retreats?**  
  Yes — ambushed defenders cannot retreat under any circumstances (unless Caesar escapes).

- **Can you Besiege a Fort?**  
  No — Besiege only allows removal of **Allied Tribes** or **Citadels**, not Forts.

- **Can multiple factions ambush in the same battle?**  
  No — only one attacker per battle; defender chooses which faction to defend against.
