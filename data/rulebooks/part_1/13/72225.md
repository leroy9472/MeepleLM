## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective
- In the 1970s, rising energy demands led to widespread construction of pollutive fossil fuel plants, increasing CO₂ levels to dangerous levels.
- Each player manages an energy company focused on building green power plants to meet demand and reduce pollution.
- The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) while preventing global CO₂ levels from reaching 500 ppm (which results in a loss for all players).
- Players must propose, install, and construct green power plants, gain expertise, and respond to global events.

2. Components
- 1 Main Board
- 100 Wooden Discs (20 per player color)
- 20 Scientist Pawns (4 per player color)
- 25 White Tech Resource Cubes
- 40 Carbon Emission Permits (CEPs)
- 1 CEP Market Price Marker (red disc)
- 1 Global CO₂ Pollution Level Marker
- 1 Decade Counter
- 1 Round Counter
- 30 Two-Sided Project Tiles (5 types: Forestation, Solar, Cold Fusion, Biomass, Recycling)
- 25 Green Power Plant Tiles (5 per type)
- 30 Fossil Fuel Power Plant Tiles (10 Coal, 10 Oil, 10 Gas)
- 8 Regional Agenda Tiles
- 18 Summit Tiles
- 26 Lobby Cards
- 13 UN Goal Cards
- 7 Company Goal Cards
- 6 Event Cards
- Money: $1 (20), $2 (15), $5 (10), $10 (5)
- 1 Starting Player Tile

3. Setup
- Each player chooses a color and takes:
  - All discs of that color
  - 1 Scientist Pawn (others go to recruitment pool)
  - Starting money: 1st player $3, 2nd/3rd $4, 4th/5th $5
  - 2 CEPs
- Place one disc per player on the 0 of the scoring track.
- Place the Decade counter on 1970 and the Round counter on the space matching player count.
- Place one Fossil Fuel Power Plant (randomly drawn) on the leftmost energy demand space of each region.
- Calculate starting CO₂ level: Coal = 40 ppm, Oil = 30 ppm, Gas = 20 ppm. Place CO₂ marker accordingly.
- In each region, place CEPs equal to the number of empty energy demand spaces.
- Place 2 CEPs in the market; set market price to $3.
- Shuffle and place 6 two-topic Summit tiles on the board; rest form a face-down draw pile.
- Randomly assign one Regional Agenda tile (showing 3 allowed energy types) to each region.
- Shuffle Lobby Cards; deal 5 to each player.
- Deal one secret Company Goal card to each player (remove specific cards based on player count).
- Reveal 10 (7 in 2-player) UN Goal cards face-up.
- Shuffle Event Cards; place one face-up on the event space, reveal the next on top of the deck.

4. Gameplay Flow
- The game spans up to 5 decades (6 in 5-player).
- Each decade consists of:
  1. Supply Phase (skipped in 1st decade)
  2. Operations Phase (multiple rounds)
- After all rounds, advance decade, reset round marker, pass start player, and begin next decade.
- Game ends when a victory condition is met.

5. Core Mechanics
- Actions (choose one per turn):
  - Propose Project: Place a project tile (dark side up) on an empty project space in a region matching its agenda. Receive grant: $ equal to CEPs in region (min $1), 2 Tech Cubes, or move/recruit a scientist.
  - Install Project: Pay 1 CEP (from hand or controlled region) to flip a proposed project. Gain benefits based on energy type (e.g., Solar: 3 Tech Cubes). If opponent’s scientist is present, pay $1; they choose to take scientist back (gain 1 Expertise) or send to matching summit.
  - Construct Power Plant: Build a green plant on an installed project. Must have Expertise ≥ number of Tech Cubes required. Pay cost in money and cubes. Place plant on leftmost empty space; if full, replace oldest fossil fuel plant (reducing CO₂). Gain VPs, 1 Expertise, mark ownership, and check region control.
- Free Moves (one each, any time during turn):
  - Move Scientist: From hand to project, project to project/hand, or project to matching summit topic.
  - Visit Market: Buy 1 CEP at current price (refill market with 2 CEPs and raise price if empty). Sell 1 CEP from hand (price drops 1), but only if price hasn’t changed this turn.
  - Play or Score Card: Play 1 Lobby Card (main or minor benefit) or score 1 UN Goal Card (pay 1 Tech Cube, gain VPs if requirements met).
- End of Turn:
  - Gain 1 Expertise in the energy type of one project your scientist is on.
  - If all topics on a summit are filled, resolve summit in turn order (active player last): each scientist earns 1 Expertise in its topic; each participating player gains 1 extra Expertise in any summit topic. Return scientists, replace tile.
- Supply Phase (after 1st decade):
  - Distribute Income: 1st and 2nd on each Expertise track gain income (money and/or VPs). In 2-player, only 1st gains.
  - Energy Supply: For each region needing power this decade, add a fossil fuel plant. Controller pays 1 CEP (from hand or region); if uncontrolled, region pays. CO₂ increases.
  - Resolve Event: If CO₂ ≥ 350 ppm, players without a green plant in the event region must pay 1 Tech Cube or lose 2 VPs.
- Region Control:
  - Determined when a green plant is built.
  - Player with most types of green plants in region wins.
  - Tiebreakers: 1) Highest type on Regional Agenda, 2) Expertise in highest required type, then 2nd, then 3rd, 3) Active player wins.
  - Benefits: Take CEPs from controlled regions when needed; receive all CEPs from them at game end.

6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends at end of Operations Phase if:
  - 5th decade ends (6th in 5-player)
  - Two regions are fully filled with green plants
  - CO₂ drops below 350 ppm (on or after 4th decade)
- Game ends at end of Supply Phase if CO₂ ≥ 500 ppm (all players lose).
- Final Scoring:
  1. Add CEPs from controlled regions to hand.
  2. Sell all CEPs at current market price (no price change).
  3. Distribute income to all players on all Expertise track positions (in VPs).
  4. Score:
     - Company Goal: X VPs or $8
     - 1 VP per $2
     - 3 VPs for most Tech Cubes (all tied players)
     - 3 VPs for most UN Goal Cards (all tied players)
- Tiebreakers: 1) Most green plants, 2) Expertise order (Forestation, Solar, Cold Fusion, Biomass, Recycling), 3) Most regions controlled.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- Can I propose/install in a full green region? Yes, but cannot construct.
- Can I sell CEP if I bought one? No, market price change blocks selling.
- What if I can’t pay a CEP during Supply Phase? Sell VPs at 1:1 rate until you can pay.
- Can I use a project with an opponent’s scientist? Yes, pay $1; they choose to take scientist back (gain Expertise) or send to summit.
- Can I discard my Company Goal? Yes, at any time, for $8 (even out of turn).
- Do I get Expertise for a scientist sent to summit by opponent? No, only if you take it back.
- Can a region have more CEPs than demand spaces? No, maximum equals number of spaces.
- How are UN Goals scored? Pay 1 Tech Cube, claim card, score VPs immediately.
