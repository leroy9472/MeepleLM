### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Fatigue  
- Track on Fatigue Dial.  
- **Sources**:  
  - Move to higher Fire Level: gain difference.  
  - Fire increases in your room: +1.  
  - Run: +2 extra.  
  - Looting: gain full Fire Level when entering room.  
  - Battle loss: difference in Battle Strength.  
- **Whitebeard**: Gains 1 less Fatigue (min 0) on movement, fire increase, or retreat.  
- **Grog Token**: Reduce Fatigue by value (free action).  

**Fatigue Limits**:  
- Cannot enter room if Fire Level ≥ number on dial with die icon.  
- If already in such room: next action must be fight fire, leave, or rest.  

#### Battles  
- Triggered when Pirate enters or is entered by Skeleton or Guard.  
- **Must fight immediately** (no actions first).  
- **Battle Steps**:  
  1. Roll Battle Die.  
  2. Optionally add **Battle Track** value (must use all; resets to 0 after).  
  3. Add Item modifiers (e.g., Sword +1).  
  4. Compare to enemy’s Battle Strength.  
- **Win**: Flip token to reveal reward (Cutlass, Grog, etc.).  
- **Lose**:  
  - Gain Fatigue = difference.  
  - Roll Battle Die again:  
    - 1–2: Enemy retreats (choose room).  
    - 3–4: You retreat (choose room; adrenaline ignores fatigue).  
    - 5: Fight again.  
    - 6: Choose result.  
- **Guard Specifics**:  
  - If lose, choose: fight again (ignore fire level) or retreat (no roll).  
  - Must fight all Skeletons before fighting Guard.  

**Cutlass Tokens**:  
- Place on lowest empty Battle Track space.  
- After using Battle Track, resets to **lowest occupied space**, not 0.  

#### Death & Replacement  
**Triggers**:  
- Fatigue reaches skull.  
- In room when it explodes.  

**Effects**:  
- Remove Pirate, Character, Item, Tokens.  
- Reset Battle Track to 0.  
- Draw new Character and Item (random).  
- Place new Pirate on Dinghies.  
- **Lose if no Characters left**.  
- **Lose if Pirate dies after looting required Treasures**.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

  1. All Fire Effects (left to right, bottom to top).  
  2. All Deckhand/Skeleton effects.

- **Looting Fatigue**: Gain full Fire Level of room entered.  
- **Running into 3+ Deckhands**: Not allowed.  
- **Battling with High Fatigue**: Battle first, then resolve fatigue restriction.
