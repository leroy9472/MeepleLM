### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On a turn:  
1. Perform **2 actions** (same action twice allowed).  
2. **Chow Down** (eat Meeplets).  
3. Check **Runaway board** for triggered effects.  

Actions (choose 2):  
- Move  
- Demolish  
- Toss a Vehicle  
- Breathe  

After actions:  
- Resolve **Chow Down**.  
- Place any Meeplets that left the board onto the Runaway board.  
- Trigger Runaway board effects if lines/zones are filled.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions  
**Move**  
- Remove Body. Flick Paws to new location. Replace Body.  
- If Paws leave the board: lose 1 Tooth (return to box). Place Paws on any empty starting area.  

**Demolish**  
- Paws must be on Sidewalk adjacent to Building.  
- Hold Body above Building, drop to destroy.  
- If Body misses: lose 1 Tooth.  

**Toss a Vehicle**  
- Monster and Vehicle must be in same Neighborhood.  
- Place Vehicle on top of Body, flick it.  
- If Vehicle leaves board: return to its color space.  
- Player may hold/tilt Body during toss.  

**Breathe**  
- Place chin on top of Body, inhale, then blow.  
- One hand may hold Body.  
- Inhale only after chin is on Body.  

#### Collateral Effects  
**Gobbling Buildings (Floors)**  
- After any action, if a Floor tile has nothing on it (no Meeple, Monster, Vehicle, or other Floor), claim it and place in your Stomach.  
- Can claim multiple Floors per turn.  

**Rumble! (Knocking Over Monsters)**  
- If your action knocks down another Monster’s Body (lands on side), break off 1 of its Teeth and place in your Stomach.  
- Fallen Body stays in place (obstacle).  
- At start of that player’s next turn, they re-stand Body on Paws.  
- Only triggers if Body is knocked down; upright Body = no effect.  
- **Boxer Power**: break 2 Teeth instead of 1.  

**Runaway Meeplets**  
- Meeplets that leave the board go to Runaway board.  
- **Side A**: Fill lines (6 total). Effects trigger when line is completed.  
  - Line 1 & 4: Lose 1 Tooth; next player places your Monster.  
  - Line 2 & 5: Lose 1 Tooth; all others get +1 action until your next turn.  
  - Line 3: Lose 2 Teeth!  
  - Line 6: Game ends immediately. Player who triggered it **loses**. Others score.  
- **Side B**: Meeplets placed by color zone. When zone fills:  
  - Red (Heroes): Lose 1 Tooth; return 4 Meeplets from Stomach to box.  
  - Blue (Journalists): Lose 1 Tooth; discard 1 card.  
  - Green (Soldiers): Lose 2 Teeth.  
  - Yellow (Blondes): Lose 1 Tooth; others get +1 action until your next turn.

#### Chow Down (Eating Meeplets)

- Only Meeplets **accessible** (not supporting elements) can be eaten.  
- Eat up to number of Teeth in Mouth:  
  - Start with 6 Teeth (2 permanent + 4 breakable).
