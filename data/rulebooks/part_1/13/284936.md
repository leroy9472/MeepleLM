## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Cafe*, players run coffee companies during the Portuguese Belle Époque, producing, processing, and delivering coffee beans from colonies like Brazil, São Tomé, and Angola. The objective is to earn the most victory points over 8 rounds by efficiently managing the coffee supply chain—producing beans, drying, roasting, and delivering to coffee shops or storing in your warehouse.

Victory points come from:
- Fully supplied coffee shops.
- Cubes in your warehouse: 2VP per cube of the scarcest color, 1VP per cube of the second-scarcest.
- Tiebreakers: most cubes on roast spaces, then dry spaces.

### 2. Components  
- 4 Company Cards  
- 4 Initial Cards (matching backs with Company Cards)  
- 140 small cubes (35 each in yellow, brown, green, red)  
- 4 big cubes (unused in base game)  
- 1 Master Token  
- 48 unique Plan Cards (each with 6 squares)  
- Rulebook  

*Optional: Expresso Expansion adds special cards (Expresso, Lote, Nata, Plus)*

### 3. Setup  
**Player Count Adjustments:**  
- 4 players: Use full deck.  
- 3 players: Remove 8 cards with ★ symbol.  
- 2 players: Remove 8 ★ cards + 8 random cards (16 total).  
- 1 player: Remove 8 ★ cards + 16 random cards (24 total).  

**Per Player Setup:**  
- Place 1 cube of each color below matching bean icon on Company Card (warehouse).  
- Place white action cube on #1 of action track.  
- Place Initial Card face-up in front of you (forms starting business area).  

**Starting Master:**  
- Player who most recently drank coffee takes Master Token.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow (8 Rounds)  
Each round follows this sequence:

1. **Draw Cards**  
   - Master draws 3 Plan Cards (4 if Expresso expansion).  
   - Lay face-up for selection.

2. **Select/Buy Cards**  
   - Starting with player to master’s left, each player chooses one card.  
   - Master picks last.  
   - After each pick, refill the market from deck.  
   - **Buying Rule:** If card has cup icon, must pay 1 cube from warehouse unless you have 2 visible ship icons in your business area (discount).  
   - **No Cube? No Buy:** If you can’t pay and don’t have 2 ships, take no card (discard it).  
   - Add chosen card to your business area.

3. **Card Placement Rules**  
   - Must cover **2–4 visible squares** of existing business area.  
   - Place **on top** of previous cards (never underneath).  
   - Can rotate card freely.  
   - May cover cubes—return them to supply.  
   - Must keep at least one cup icon visible in total business area.

4. **Perform Actions (1–8 actions)**  
   - Number of visible cup icons = action points (max 8).  
   - Use white cube to track remaining actions on Company Card.  
   - Actions may be done in any order. Unspent actions are lost.

   **Action Types:**  
   - **Produce:** Place 1+ cubes on **bean squares (A)**.  
     - Single action: place one cube per **orthogonally adjacent cluster** of same-color bean squares.  
   - **Dry:** Move cubes from bean squares to **dry squares (B)**.  
     - One color per dry square.  
     - Cluster of adjacent B squares = dry one set per square in cluster.  
   - **Roast:** Move cubes from dry squares to **roast squares (C)**.  
     - One color per roast square.  
     - Cluster of adjacent C squares = roast one set per square.  
     - Red cubes require an extra action to roast on ★ square.  
   - **Deliver:** Move **all** cubes from one or more roast squares to:  
     - Coffee shops (D) in your business area, or  
     - Your warehouse.  
     - Coffee shops must be **fully visible** to receive delivery.  
     - All roast squares are treated as connected for delivery.  

   **General Rules:**  
   - Clear any square of cubes at any time (no action cost).  
   - No square (except coffee shops) can hold multiple colors or multiple cubes of same color.  
   - Clusters must be orthogonally adjacent (no diagonals).

5. **Discard Unused Cards**  
   - Discard remaining face-up cards after selection.

6. **Pass Master Token**  
   - Pass to player on the left.

Repeat for 8 rounds.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Action Economy:** Cups = actions (capped at 8).  
- **Supply Chain Flow:** Bean → Dry → Roast → Deliver/Warehouse.  
- **Card Placement:** Drives engine building. Strategic layering unlocks clusters and discounts.  
- **Cube Management:** Cubes are both resources and currency (for buying cards and bidding).  
- **Warehouse:** Stores cubes for scoring and payment.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Condition:** After 8th round.

**Scoring:**  
1. **Coffee Shops:**  
   - Score only **fully supplied** shops (all required cubes delivered).  
   - Value printed on shop = VP earned.  
   - Partially hidden or unsupplied shops = 0 VP.

2. **Warehouse Cubes:**  
   - Sort by color.  
   - **Lowest count color:** 2VP per cube (0 if missing).  
   - **Second-lowest count color:** 1VP per cube (0 if missing).  
   - Only two colors score, even if tied.  
   - If only one color present: only that color scores if it’s the lowest (2VP), second = 0.  
   - If no cubes: 0 from warehouse.

**Final Score = Coffee Shop VP + Warehouse VP**

**Tiebreakers:**  
1. Most cubes on roast squares.  
2. Most cubes on dry squares.  
3. All tied players win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I deliver to multiple shops in one action?**  
  Yes. "Deliver" allows moving cubes from roast squares to **any or all** coffee shops and/or warehouse in one action.  
- **Can I deliver to a partially covered shop?**  
  No. Coffee shop must be **fully visible** to receive delivery. If later covered, cubes return to supply.  
- **Can I roast different colors in one action?**  
  Yes, if you have a cluster of adjacent roast squares—each square can roast one color.  
- **Can I use warehouse cubes during the game?**  
  Only to pay for cards or in Advanced Variant bidding. Not for production.  
- **What if I have no cup icons visible?**  
  Invalid. You must always keep at least one cup visible. Plan placement must preserve this.
