## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Merchant of Venus, players are interstellar merchants seeking to amass wealth by exploring space, trading goods, and investing in infrastructure. The objective varies by game version:  
- In Classic: The first player to reach 2,000 credits in total wealth (credits + deed values) at the end of their turn wins immediately.  
- In Standard: After round 30, players calculate final scores based on credits, fame, and bonuses. The player with the highest score wins. Ties are broken by fame; if still tied, players share victory.

2. Components  
- Game board depicting systems, trade routes, anomalies, and encounter spaces  
- Player dashboards (Standard) or ship class sheets (Classic)  
- Plastic ships, credit tokens, fame/infamy tokens  
- First Contact cards (one per system)  
- Encounter, Reward, and Mission cards (Standard only)  
- Market, goods, racial technology, passenger, and demand tokens

- Telegate tokens, pirate tokens, asteroid tokens  

3. Setup

- Shuffle passenger tokens into a face-down pile.  
- Each player picks a color and pilot (Human, Eeepeeep, Whynom, Qosssuth), takes dashboard, ship, mission tokens, and spaceport/drill tokens.  
- Deal one face-up Mission card to each player. Place mission token in destination system if applicable.  
- Starting player determined randomly; give First Player card.  
- Give starting credits: players × 20; 3rd player +20, 4th +40.  
- Set laser/shield dials: one to 1, one to 2 (player’s choice).  
- Place round marker on “1”; draw and place one passenger.  
- All ships start at Galactic Base.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game round (except first) begins with resolving the round icon:  
- Passenger: Draw and place one passenger token.  
- Drill: Each player retrieves drill tokens and gains 10c each.

Player turns proceed clockwise and consist of four phases:  
1. Movement Phase  
2. First Contact Phase (if applicable)  
3. Transaction Phase  
4. Merchant Spaceport Phase (if applicable)

5. Core Mechanics  
Movement Phase:  
- Declare Heading: Point ship in desired direction (not required if on surface city/spaceport).  
- Set Speed: Roll 3 speed dice (max 4 dice ever allowed). Assign up to pilot level number of dice to Navigation, Throttle (if rolled a 1), or Ship Upgrades.  
- Move: Spend movement points (MPs). Gray lines cost 1 MP; green lines cost 2 MPs. No backtracking.  
- End Movement: Land on surface city, spaceport, or asteroid, or spend all MPs. Landing on asteroid ends turn.

Navigation Spaces: Must exit using path matching Navigation die. Cannot exit via entry path. If no die assigned, player to the left chooses exit.

Telegates: Upon entering (not starting on), if Navigation die matches another telegate number, immediately move there (no MP cost). Declare new heading and continue.

Hazards:  
- Laser/Shield: Roll purple die. If ≥ value, either end turn or reduce value by 1 and continue (treat future hazards as blue).  
- Pilot: Roll purple die. If ≥ pilot skill, end turn.

Pirates:  
- Ambush: If entered on last MP, automatically lose.  
- Otherwise, choose attribute (Laser, Shield, Pilot), roll purple die + pirate modifier.  
- Win: Pilot – add up to pilot level MPs; Shield – gain 2 fame; Laser – collect 20c per infamy under pirate, flip to asteroid, draw Reward card.  
- Lose: Return one matching good or pay 20c (or all credits if <20c); end turn; place infamy token under pirate.

First Contact Phase (only when landing on surface city or neutral spaceport in undiscovered system):  
- Flip First Contact card.  
- Place culture’s market tokens (shuffled, face-up stack), goods, racial techs, and any passengers.  
- Take First Contact card and place IOU credits on it.  
- Perform up to 3 buy and 3 sell actions with that culture.

Transaction Phase (on surface city or spaceport):  
- Buy: Goods, equipment (lasers, shields, cargo holds, drives), or racial technologies.  
- Sell: Goods to buying cultures. Market condition (Low, Active, High) determines resale value.  
- After selling, shift market: move top market token to bottom. If new top is Active (gear), produce one good from supply.  
- Pick Up/Drop Off Passengers: Unlimited; collect fare and fame/infamy when dropping off.  
- Offload: At any time, place goods, techs, or passengers into current system’s market (immediately available). Passengers can be offloaded at Galactic Base only.  
- Buy/Sell Limit: Only 1 buy and 1 sell if just landed on surface city this turn. No limit at spaceports.

Merchant Spaceport Phase:  
- If no buy actions were taken this turn, may build one merchant spaceport.  
- Must be on surface city; pay 200c; place token on adjacent empty orbit space; move ship to it.  
- In Asteroid System: Must be on neutral spaceport; pay 200c; place token on orbit space connected by three green lines; place asteroid token on now-bankrupt neutral spaceport.  
- Other players pay owner 10c per buy/sell at your spaceport. You gain 10c from bank per action at your own.

Pilot Upgrades:  
- Level 1 → 2: Land at Galactic Base, pay 60c.  
- Level 2 → 3: Land at home culture’s system, pay 60c (not reduced by discount). Choose ability.  
- Discount: Level 1 = 10c, Level 2 = 20c, Level 3 = 30c off all purchases in home culture.

Second Mission:  
- Land at Galactic Base, pay 60c, draw second Mission card, gain 5 fame.  
- Complete missions in any order.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Classic:  
- Game ends when any player has ≥2000 credits + deed value at end of turn.  
- Net worth = credits + merchant spaceport deeds + factory deeds (value on token, not purchase price).  
- Credits on First Contact cards not counted.

Standard:  
- Game ends after last player’s turn in round 30.  
- Final Score:  
  1. Sell Merchant Spaceports: Gain 200c each.  
  2. Count Fame:  
     - Fame tokens  
     - Reward cards  
     - Completed Missions  
     - Dashboard: cargo holds (2 for first, 4 for second), ship upgrades (2 for second, 4 for third), laser/shield dials (value shown), pilot level  
     - Fuzzy Dice: roll 2d6, gain that fame  
     - Lose 1 fame per infamy (if ≤0 fame, disqualified)  
  3. Award Bonus Credits: Fame × 10; if Fuzzy Dice roll was doubles, ×20.  
  4. Total all credit tokens.  
- Highest score wins. Tie: highest fame wins. Still tied: share victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Multiple demands: When selling a good, receive bonus from all demands; only one demand removed per sale.  
- Offloading vs Jettisoning: Offload at surface cities/spaceports to market; jettison elsewhere to culture supply (passengers removed, roll for infamy).  
- Ship Upgrades: Must assign die to use; if jettisoned/offloaded, shift others up.  
- Telegate Start: Starting on telegate has no effect.  
- Market Production: Only if culture has goods in supply.  
- Pilot Discount: Applies even at own spaceport in home culture.  
- Credit Shortage: Use substitutes if tokens run out.
