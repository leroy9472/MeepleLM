## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Catan Card Game is a two-player strategy card game based on the popular board game *The Settlers of Catan*. Players build principalities by developing regions, constructing settlements and cities, and acquiring resources. The goal is to be the first to reach the required number of Victory Points (VPs) through expansion, trade, and control of special tokens.

### 2. Components  
Each player receives:  
- 9 cards with matching coat-of-arms (Red or Blue)  
  - 1 Road  
  - 2 Settlements  
  - 6 Region cards (initially placed diagonally around settlements)  
- Development cards: Action (yellow), Green, and Red cards  
- Expansion cards (divided into stacks)  
- Event cards  
- 2 dice: Event die and Production die  
- Knight and Commerce (Windmill) Tokens  

### 3. Setup  
- Each player takes all 9 cards of one color and builds their starting principality:  
  - Place the Road in the center  
  - Place a Settlement on each side of the Road  
  - Place the 6 Region cards diagonally around the Settlements  
- Set each Region card to show 1 resource (flip to correct side)  
- Shuffle Event cards and place face down between players; place other 4 Development decks nearby  
- Shuffle Expansion cards and divide into 5 roughly equal stacks (2 stacks will have 1 extra card; both players must know which)  
- Randomly determine starting player  
- Starting player searches one Expansion stack and selects 3 cards for starting hand  
- Second player does the same from a different stack (stacks remain in order; no reshuffling)  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players alternate turns following this sequence:  
1. **Roll Dice**  
   - Roll the Event die and Production die  
2. **Resolve Event Die**  
   - Effects apply to both players:  
     - **Tournament (Knight's Head)**: Compare red numbers on all knights. Player with highest total Knight Strength gains 1 resource of choice.  
     - **Commerce Advantage (Windmill)**: Player controlling Commerce Token takes 1 resource from opponent.  
     - **Brigands (Club)**: If unprotected resources (not adjacent to a Garrison) exceed 7, player loses all Ore and Wool. Ignored on first 2 turns.  
     - **Year of Plenty (Sun)**: Each player gains 1 resource of choice.  
     - **Event (Question Mark)**: Draw an Event card, resolve its effect (applies to both), return it face down to bottom of deck.  
3. **Production Phase**  
   - All Region cards matching the number rolled on the Production die gain 1 additional resource (rotate card to show increased resource)  
4. **Action Phase**  
   - Perform any of the following in any order, as often as desired:  
     - Play 1 or more Action (yellow) cards  
     - Trade resources (3:1 ratio internally, 2:1 with Merchant Fleets)  
     - Build: Play a Development card by paying resource cost; rotate matching Region cards to reduce supply  
5. **Draw Phase**  
   - Check hand limit (starts at 3)  
   - If below hand limit, draw up to limit  
   - If at or above limit:  
     - Discard excess cards face down under any Expansion stack(s)  
     - Then discard 1 card from hand to bottom of any stack and draw 1 replacement from any stack  
     - Option: Pay 2 resources of any type to search a stack and choose a card (instead of drawing blindly)  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Expanding Your Principality  
- **Build a Road**: Must separate Settlements or Cities. Can be built same turn as Settlement/City.  
- **Build a Settlement**:  
  - Must be adjacent to an existing Road  
  - When placed, draw 2 new Region cards and place at outer corners, showing 0 resources  
  - Can draw from top of any stack or use Scout card to choose  
  - Each Settlement = 1 VP  
- **Build a City**:  
  - Built on top of an existing Settlement (Settlement no longer counts)  
  - Each City = 1 additional VP (total 2 VPs per City)  
- **Add Expansion Cards**:  
  - Green or Red cards placed above or below Settlements/Cities  
  - Settlement: 1 card above, 1 below  
  - City: 2 cards above, 2 below  
  - Cards above city affect only upper regions; below affect lower regions  

#### Tokens  
- **Knight Token**: Awarded to player with highest total Knight Strength (black numbers on knight units). Worth 1 VP.  
- **Commerce (Windmill) Token**: Awarded to player with at least one City **and** highest total Commerce Points. Worth 1 VP.  
- **Ties**: If players are tied in strength or commerce, **neither** controls the token.  

#### Action Cards  
- Cards marked **Attack** or **Neutral** can only be played once **both players** have at least **7 VPs**  
- Once played, Attack/Neutral cards are **removed from the game**  
- Opponent may play a counter card in defense  
- **General Rule Update**: Some sources indicate Action cards can only be played when both players have **at least 3 VPs** — this may reflect variant or updated rule; default is 7 VPs unless otherwise specified  

#### Trading  
- Internal trade: 3:1 ratio of same resource types  
- With Merchant Fleets: 2:1 ratio  
- Open trading with opponent allowed at any time  

#### Expanded Game Rules (Optional Theme Decks)  
- Choose a Theme deck (e.g., Knights & Merchants, Science & Progress, etc.)  
- Combine Event cards from Theme and base set  
- Set aside specific cards as noted per theme (e.g., 2 Inquisition cards removed entirely)  
- Create **New Development Stack** with 2 copies of specific cards (e.g., 2 University, 5 Citadel, etc.)  
  - Can be purchased like normal Development cards  
  - Only one of each type allowed per player  
  - Cards that leave play return to this stack  
- Expansion cards split into **4 basic stacks** + **2 theme stacks** (6 total)  
- When drawing, may choose from any of the 6 stacks  
- **The Spy**: Can only steal **Units** or **Action cards**; cannot steal Buildings, Wizards, or Magic Spells  
- **Making Space**: On your turn, you may **discard** an Expansion card from your principality to make room for another  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Base Game**: First player to reach **12 Victory Points** wins  
- **Expanded Game**: First player to reach **13 Victory Points** wins  
- Victory Points come from:  
  - Settlements: 1 VP each  
  - Cities: 1 VP each (in addition to replacing Settlement)  
  - Knight Token: 1 VP  
  - Commerce Token: 1 VP  
  - Some Development cards may grant VPs  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Hand Limit**: Must discard down to limit **before** drawing replacements. If at or over limit, discard down, then discard 1 more and draw 1.  
- **Searching Stacks**: Allowed only by paying 2 resources; stacks must remain in order afterward.  
- **Brigands Rule**: Only triggers if **unprotected** resources (not adjacent to a Garrison) exceed 7. Ignored on first 2 turns.  
- **Token Control**: Requires **strict majority**. Tie = no one controls. Commerce Token also requires **at least one City**.  
- **Action Card Timing**: Attack/Neutral cards require both players to have **at least 7 VPs** (per core rules), though some sources say 3 VPs — clarify before play.  
- **Event Card**: Drawn only on "?", resolved immediately, returned face down to bottom.  
- **Drawing Region Cards**: When building a Settlement, draw 2 new Region cards — can use Scout to choose, otherwise top of any stack.
