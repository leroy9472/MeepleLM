## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Forces of Shadow have risen from the demon world and face off against Hunters. Neutral characters are caught in the crossfire. Each player is secretly aligned with one of three factions: Hunters (eliminate all Shadows), Shadows (eliminate all Hunters or three Neutral characters), or Neutrals (fulfill unique personal win conditions). The game revolves around hidden identities, area movement, and tactical attacks. Victory occurs when a player fulfills their character-specific win condition, which may involve killing others, surviving, or collecting equipment.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, follow these steps in order:  

#### 1. Move (Mandatory)  
- Roll both dice. Move to the Area indicated by the sum.  
- If you roll your current Area, reroll until you get a different number.  
- If you roll a 7, move to any Area except your current one.  

#### 2. Action (Optional)  
After moving, you may perform the action associated with your current Area:  
- **Weird Woods**: Deal 2 damage to any player OR heal 1 damage to any player.  
- **Erstwhile Altar**: Steal one Equipment card from another player in any Area.  
- Drawing Cards:  
  - Draw one card from the White, Black, or Hermit deck (player’s choice).  
  - **Single-use Cards**: Read aloud, resolve effect, then discard.  
  - **Equipment Cards**: Play face-up in front of you. Effects are permanent and stack.  
  - **Hermit Cards**: Draw, read, then pass face-down to any player. That player follows instructions if applicable (based on name or allegiance); otherwise says “Nothing happens.” Discard after use.  
    - *Exception*: The Unknown may lie when following Hermit Card instructions.  

#### 3. Attack (Optional)  
- Target a character in your current Area or an adjacent (paired) Area.  
- Roll both dice. Damage = absolute difference between the two dice.  
- If both dice show the same number, attack fails (0 damage).  
- Apply damage modifiers from Equipment or abilities.  
- Damage is inflicted only if final value > 0.  
- If the attack kills a character:  
  - Killer takes **one** Equipment card of their choice from the victim.  
  - Discard all other Equipment cards the victim had.  
  - Victim reveals identity and is eliminated.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Character Abilities  
- Most special abilities require **revealing your identity** to use.  
- You may reveal your identity at any time, even during another player’s turn.  
- **Exceptions**: Daniel and Unknown can use abilities without revealing.  
- Once an action or attack is declared, abilities cannot interrupt it.  

#### Damage & Death  
- Track damage using your piece on the Death Spiral.  
- Character dies when damage ≥ HP (listed on Character Card).  
- Death triggers:  
  - Reveal identity.  
  - Remove from board.  
  - Killer gains one Equipment card.  
- Multiple deaths from one effect: gain one Equipment card per victim.  

#### Equipment Cards  
- Can equip unlimited cards.  
- Effects are always active unless specified.  
- Stack multiplicatively (e.g., +1 damage from two weapons = +2 total).  
- “When you reveal identity” effects can be used even if already revealed.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you heal an undamaged player?** Yes, but no effect occurs.  
- **Does Suck Blood trigger if damage is negated?** No. Must successfully inflict damage.  
- **Can Counterattack respond to card effects?** No. Only to “Attack” actions.  
- **Can you use abilities after being attacked but before damage resolves?** No. Must wait until after resolution.  
- **Hermit Card instructions**: Only follow if your name or team matches. Unknown may lie.  
- **Simultaneous deaths**: Damage is applied in target order. The first death counts first.  
  - Example: Bloodthirsty Spider kills last Hunter and last Shadow → Shadow wins because Hunter died first.  
- **Equipment stacking**: All Equipment effects combine (e.g., +1 and +1 = +2).  
- **Revealing identity mid-turn**: Allowed, but ability use still follows timing rules.  
- **Wight’s Multiplication**: Extra turns occur immediately after your turn ends.
