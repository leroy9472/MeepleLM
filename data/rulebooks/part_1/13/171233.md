## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
You are student magicians who have accidentally opened the Big Book of Madness, releasing powerful Monsters. Your goal is to reseal the book by defeating all Monsters across six Rounds, culminating in vanquishing the final Monster. The game is cooperative: all players win or lose together.

Victory: Turn all pages of the Grimoire and defeat the final Monster.  
Defeat: Occurs if:
- The Madness stack is empty when a player must receive a Madness.
- The final Monster is not defeated.
- All players are eliminated due to Madness.

### 2. Components

### 3. Setup
1. Place the gameboard on the table.
2. Place the Madness stack (35 cards) on the designated space.
3. Sort Curse cards by type (Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Multi-Element) into face-down piles.
4. Place value-2 and value-3 Element cards in 8 face-up stacks (by element and value).
5. Each player:
   - Takes 4 Basic Spells (Combustion, Ice, Growth, Telepathy).
   - Chooses a Magician and takes the starting Element cards shown.
   - Returns all unused value-1 Element cards to the box.
   - Shuffles their starting deck and places it face-down.
   - Draws 6 cards to form starting hand.
6. Compose the Grimoire:
   - Place Final Page on the Lectern, Bonus/Failure side up.
   - Shuffle 12 Interior pages, draw 5, place them on Final Page (Bonus/Failure side up).
   - Draw 1 random Cover Page, place it face-down on top.
7. Place Round marker on chosen difficulty level (I, II, III) on the Round track.
8. Place Invocation marker on the Invocation space.
9. Place Element tokens near the board.
10. Randomly choose first player (receives Active Player token).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each player’s turn consists of four phases in order:

#### 1. Concentration Phase
- Refresh all exhausted Spells (rotate back to upright).

#### 2. Monster Phase
- Advance Invocation marker one space counterclockwise.
- Apply the effect of the space landed on:
  - **Spaces 2–5**: If a Curse is present, apply its effect to all players (starting with active player, clockwise). Effects are applied only once, when the marker lands.
  - **Invocation Space**:
    - If any Curses remain: Apply Failure Penalty (from Grimoire’s right-hand page), discard remaining Curses.
    - If all Curses destroyed: Apply Success Bonus, discard Curses.
  - Then:
    - Move Invocation marker to space 1 (New Monster).
    - Turn the Grimoire page to reveal the next Monster.
    - Apply the new Monster’s Arrival Effect (from left-hand page).
    - Move Round marker down one box (determines number of Multi-Element Curses to place: 0, 1, or 2).
    - Draw 3 Curses (matching symbols on left-hand page), place them face-up on spaces 2–5 (after Multi-Element Curses; space 3 holds two).

#### 3. Action Phase
Player may take any number of actions, in any order, as long as costs can be paid by discarding Element cards from hand or support pool.

Available actions:
- **Activate a Spell**: Pay Activation Cost in Elements. Exhaust the Spell. Can overpay (up to 3× cost) to augment effect (multiply variable by 2 or 3).
- **Learn a New Spell**: Pay 2 Elements of the same type as the Spell. Place it in front of you. Reveal next card in that deck. Max 5 Spells (6 for Male Earth Magician).
- **Acquire an Element Card**: Pay 2 Elements (for value-2) or 3 Elements (for value-3) of the same type. Place acquired card in your discard pile.
- **Destroy a Curse**: Pay the Elements shown on the Curse. Destroy one Curse. Receive a value-2 Element card of your choice (if available).
- **Cure a Madness**: Pay 2 Elements of the same type. Return one Madness from your hand or any player’s support to the Madness stack.

#### 4. Recuperation Phase
- Draw cards until you have exactly 6 in hand.
- If you have more than 6, discard down to 6 (only Element cards; Madness cards cannot be discarded this way).
- If deck is empty when drawing, add a Madness to discard, shuffle to form new deck.
- If you have 6 Madness cards in hand at the end of this phase, you are eliminated. Return all your cards to the box.

Pass Active Player token to the left. Next player begins their turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Element Cards**: Used to pay for actions. Discarded from hand or support. Produce 1, 2, or 3 Elements of a specific type.
- **Support Pool**: Cards placed in support (via Spells like Ice) remain until discarded for costs or effects. All players may use any card in the support pool for costs. Default limit: 3 cards per player (varies by Magician).
- **Spells**: Owned by players. Activated by paying Elements. Exhausted after use. Refreshed during Concentration Phase.
- **Curses**: Placed on Invocation track. Applied once when marker lands. Destroyed via Action. Multi-Element Curses occupy spaces 1 and 2 first.
- **Madness**:
  - Received when drawing from empty deck.
  - Can be cured (returned to stack), destroyed (removed from game), or discarded (only via effects).
  - Having 6 in hand at end of turn eliminates a player.
- **Magician Abilities**: Activate once per turn during your Action Phase.
  - Male Air: Draw 1 card. If Madness, cure it; else discard. (Draw from new deck if needed.)
  - Female Air: Draw 1 card each time any Curse is destroyed.
  - Male Earth: Can have up to 6 Spells.
  - Female Earth: Exchange 1 or 2 cards in hand with cards in support (must replace, not just take or give).
  - Male Fire: Discard 1 Madness, draw 1 card. (If deck empty, gain Madness, shuffle, draw.)
  - Female Fire: Refresh 1 exhausted Spell (own or another’s).
  - Male Water: Treat 1 value-1 Air card as any Element (once per turn).
  - Female Water: Can have up to 5 cards in support.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
There is no scoring. The game ends when:
- **Win**: All Grimoire pages are turned and the final Monster is defeated (all Curses destroyed before Invocation marker reaches end).
- **Lose**:
  - A player must receive a Madness but the Madness stack is empty.
  - The final Monster is not defeated.
  - All players are eliminated (each has 6 Madness in hand at end of their turn).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hand Size**: Only active player refills to 6 during Recuperation Phase. Other players may have any number.
- **Discarding Madness**: Can be discarded via effects (e.g., Warmblooded), but not during Recuperation Phase.
- **Partial Actions**: You may take part of a multi-action effect (e.g., from Telepathy), then pass.
- **Curse Order**: Applied left to right. Multi-Element Curses always go to spaces 1 and 2.
- **Round Length**: Always 5 turns, even if all Curses are destroyed early.
- **Acquiring Elements**: Actions are independent. Cannot spend three value-2 cards to get a value-3 and a value-2 in one action.
- **Casting Spells**: Can cast even if effect cannot be fully applied (e.g., target has no cards), but must apply as much as possible.
- **Targeting**: Spells targeting "1 other player" cannot target self or the same player multiple times in one casting.
- **Card Placement**: Cards used to pay for actions are discarded immediately.
- **Variants**:
  - **Terror**: Each player starts with 1 Madness shuffled into their deck.
  - **Nightmare**: Replace starting value-2 Element card with a value-1 of same color. Combine with Terror.
  - **Bunch of Dunces**: No reward when destroying a Curse.
  - **Unending Madness**: Curing Madness costs 3 same-type Elements.
  - **There’s Something for Everyone**: In 5-player games, last player becomes first of next round, taking two turns consecutively.
