### 1. Lore & Objective

In the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout, survivors explore the wasteland, complete quests, fight enemies, and influence the power struggle between two major factions. The goal depends on the scenario and game mode being played.

**Standard Game Objective:**  
A survivor wins by acquiring enough Influence (via Agenda Cards) to meet the threshold based on player count, while preventing either faction from taking over the wasteland.

- 1 player: 11 Influence  
- 2 players: 10 Influence  
- 3 players: 9 Influence  
- 4 players: 8 Influence  

A survivor must declare victory when they meet the required Influence. If multiple survivors meet the threshold, they share victory.

**Cooperative Game Objective (Unofficial):**  
All survivors align with a Friendly faction. They win if:
- They acquire the required number of Agenda Cards:
  - 6 (Solo), 7 (2 players), 8 (3 players), 9 (4 players)
- The Friendly faction reaches the end of the Faction Power Track (FPT)

They lose if:
- Any Survivor is killed
- The Enemy faction reaches the end of the FPT
- The Friendly faction reaches the end of the FPT before Agenda Cards are acquired

**New California Scenario (Expansion):**  
Survivors win as a group when the Star (Freedom) faction token reaches the end of the power track.  
They lose as a group when the Shield (Security) faction token reaches the end.  
Agenda Cards are used to move faction tokens, not for individual Influence.

### 2. Components

- Survivor figures and character cards  
- Player boards and pegs (HP, Rads, XP)  
- S.P.E.C.I.A.L. tokens  
- Enemy tokens (Critter, Human, Robot, Super Mutant, Monster)  
- Agenda Cards  
- Quest, Encounter, Loot, Asset, Perk, Mutation, Workshop Upgrade, Unique Asset cards  
- Card library (numbered cards)  
- Scenario sheet with power track  
- Faction power tokens (Shield and Star)  
- C.A.M.P. tokens  
- Caps (currency)

### 3. Setup

1. Choose a scenario and place the corresponding scenario sheet.
2. Build the map using △ and ● tiles as shown on the back of the scenario sheet. Place tiles facedown.
3. Place a C.A.M.P. token on the "Crossroads Camp" space.
4. Sort tokens into supply piles: S.P.E.C.I.A.L., Caps, traits, enemies.
5. Create decks:
   - Encounter decks (Wasteland, Settlement, Vault 84, Vault 109)
   - Loot, Asset, Modification, Mutation, Workshop Upgrade, Perk, Activation, Goal decks
   - Card library (numbered cards)
6. Deal 4 Asset cards faceup to form the shop.
7. Shuffle Activation deck and place to the right of the first player.
8. Randomly choose a first player.
9. Each player:
   - Chooses a survivor, takes figure, character card, and matching S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token
   - Places figure in an unoccupied space in "Crossroads Camp"
   - Takes player board, places red peg at 16 (HP), green peg at 0 (Rads), gray peg to the left of XP track
   - Places starting S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token on board, draws one additional random S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token (if duplicate, redraw)
   - Takes 3 Caps
   - Draws 1 Agenda Card (kept secret)
10. Resolve any setup effects on the scenario sheet.
11. Place enemy tokens faceup in spaces marked with enemy icons.
12. For **Atomic Bonds**, replace scenario sheet with loyal faction version, place double-sided power token (opposing faction faceup), deal 1 Mutation card facedown per survivor, reveal 4 Goal cards, and do not use Agenda Cards.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

1. **Player Turn (Active Player):**  
   Perform up to 2 actions (same action may be repeated, except Encounter):
   - **Move:** Gain 2 movement points. Spend 1 point per adjacent space. Difficult terrain (red) costs 2 points. Irradiated terrain (green) causes 1 Rad.
   - **Explore:** Reveal an adjacent facedown map tile. Orient it with the arrow matching the starting tile. Place enemy tokens faceup on matching icons.
   - **Fight:** Fight one enemy in your space or adjacent (if equipped with ranged weapon). Roll V.A.T.S. dice, apply rerolls, resolve hits.
   - **Encounter:** Once per turn, if no enemy in space, resolve an encounter card from the deck matching the icon in your space.
   - **Quest:** Complete a quest objective marked with a ♣ icon, if requirements are met and no enemy in space.
   - **Camp:** Recover 3 HP, unexhaust all cards, gain Well Rested trait, trade with adjacent survivors.
   - **Fast Travel (Atomic Bonds):** Move to any space with a C.A.M.P. token.

2. **End of Round:**
   - First player reveals top card of Activation deck.
   - **Activate Enemies:** For each enemy type shown, move each enemy 1 space toward nearest survivor. If adjacent or in same space and has Ranged icon, fight instead.
   - **Activate Opposing Faction (if icon matches):** Advance opposing faction’s power token 1 space and resolve activation effect based on number of their enemies on map.
   - **Choose First Player:** Current first player may pass the role to another.
   - Flip all inactive enemies of activated types faceup.

3. Repeat until win or loss condition is met.

### 5. Core Mechanics

**Combat (Fight Action):**
1. Roll 3 V.A.T.S. dice.
2. Reroll: Generate 1 reroll per S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token on your equipped weapon that matches your tokens. Use rerolls to reroll any number of dice.
3. Resolve Enemy Hits: For each ● icon not canceled by your armor (●), suffer damage equal to enemy level.
4. Resolve Survivor Hits: For each die showing a vulnerable area (green) that matches enemy’s vulnerabilities, inflict 1 hit. If total hits ≥ enemy level, kill it.
5. Gain XP: If killed, gain XP equal to enemy level.

**Assisting:**  
A survivor in the same space or adjacent (with ranged weapon) may assist. They roll the Assist die. Hits add to attack. If enemy is killed, assistant gains 1 XP. Assistant suffers damage equal to enemy level for each ● on Assist die.

**Ranged Combat:**  
- Survivor with ranged weapon can fight adjacent enemy. If enemy lacks ranged, survivor gains +1 hit.
- Enemy with ranged ability can attack adjacent survivor during activation. If survivor lacks ranged weapon, enemy gains +1 hit.

**Tests:**  
Required for some quests and encounters. Roll 3 V.A.T.S. dice. Succeed if hits ≥ difficulty. For each matching S.P.E.C.I.A.L. token, generate 1 reroll.

**Looting:**  
Enemies with Loot icon drop 1 Loot card when killed.

**Shopping:**  
At Settlement encounter:
- Draw 1 Asset card to left of shop.
- Buy: Spend Caps equal to cost.
- Sell: Discard item, gain Caps equal to cost minus 1.
- After shopping, refill shop to 4 cards (discard from right if over, draw from deck if under).

**Leveling Up:**  
- Move XP peg across S.P.E.C.I.A.L. tokens. Each move = 1 XP.
- When peg moves past last token, level up: place peg back at start, draw 2 random S.P.E.C.I.A.L. tokens, choose 1.
  - If new, add to board.
  - If duplicate, gain a Perk Card instead.
- Perks: Discard during your turn for effect. Cannot use during non-move actions unless specified.

**Traits:**  
- Three pairs: Idolized/Vilified, Synth/Super Mutant, Well Rested/Addicted.
- Well Rested: Can be discarded during test or fight to gain 1 reroll.
- Addicted: Cannot sell drug items.

**C.A.M.P. & Fast Travel (Atomic Bonds):**  
- Gain C.A.M.P. tokens from game effects.
- During Camp action in a named space, place a C.A.M.P. token there.
- Fast Travel action: Move to any space with a C.A.M.P. token.

**Death:**  
- If HP ≤ Rads, you are killed.
- Place figure in Crossroads Camp, discard inventory (keep equipped items), recover HP (red peg to 16), keep Rads.
- In Atomic Bonds: Advance opposing faction’s power token 1 space.
- In New California: Advance opposing faction’s token 1 space.
- If still killed (Rads = 16), you are eliminated.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

**Standard Game:**
- Win: A survivor reaches required Influence and declares victory before any faction takes over.
- Lose: A faction’s token reaches the end of the power track and no survivor has enough Influence to win.

When Agenda deck is exhausted:
- Shuffle discard pile to form new deck.
- Pass deck to player right of first player (they become new first player).
- Advance both faction tokens 1 space.

**Cooperative Game:**
- Win: Acquire required Agenda Cards AND Friendly faction reaches FPT end.
- Lose: Any survivor dies, Enemy faction reaches FPT end, or Friendly faction reaches FPT end before Agenda Cards are collected.

**New California:**
- Win: Star (Freedom) faction token reaches end of track.
- Lose: Shield (Security) faction token reaches end.
- Agenda Cards discarded immediately for effects:
  - Freedom (Star): Advance Star token 1 space.
  - Security (Shield): Advance Shield token 1 space.
  - Other: Survivor chooses which token to move.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Aggressive Enemies:** Fight immediately only when moving into or being moved into by the enemy. Do not fight if enemy is placed or becomes active in your space.
- **Ranged Combat over Unexplored Tiles:** Enemy can attack you (treats tile as one space), but you cannot attack enemy (they are not in an adjacent space from your view).
- **Assist Damage:** Armor does not reduce damage from Assist die (unconfirmed, but likely not).
- **Inventory Limit:** Max 3 assets. Excess must be discarded immediately. Equipped items do not count.
- **Trading:** Can trade during Camp action with adjacent survivors. Includes items, Caps, loot, agendas. Cannot trade traits, S.P.E.C.I.A.L. tokens, or perks.
- **Perk Timing:** Can be used anytime during your turn except during non-move actions, unless specified.
- **Enemy Respawns:** When killed, draw new token of same type and place facedown at closest spawn point of matching type.
- **"Draw and Fight":** Enemy is discarded after fight, no respawn. Must kill to succeed if part of quest objective.
- **Ties:** For target selection, choose survivor with lowest HP. If tie, choose earliest in turn order.
