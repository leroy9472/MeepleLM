## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
As a 19th-century novelist, you aim to earn prestige by writing novels across genres—Adventure, Horror, Mystery, and Romance. You build your personal deck of letter cards to spell words, acquire powerful new cards, and specialize in genres for greater rewards. The first player to reach 60 prestige triggers the final round; the player with the most prestige at the end wins and is crowned the finest author of the age.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn:  
1. Use Ink (optional) — spend Ink tokens to draw extra cards from your deck  
2. Spell a word — use face-up cards from your hand and/or in-play Timeless Classic cards; may use wild cards (face-down)  
3. (Optional) Claim Literary Award — if word length matches top Literary Award card, take it and remove all lower-numbered awards  
4. Resolve card benefits — apply Basic and Genre Benefits  
5. Purchase — spend Coins to buy cards from Offer Row, Ink, Adverts, or use Player Power  
6. Discard — place used cards (except Timeless Classics) in discard pile; return used Ink to supply; return other players’ Timeless Classics to their discard piles  
7. Draw next hand — draw 5 cards; reshuffle discard pile if needed  

After your turn:  
- You may use Ink or Remover tokens before your next turn begins  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Letters & Words**: Spell valid dictionary words using cards from hand and in-play Timeless Classics. Unused cards may be played as wilds (face-down), providing no benefits.  
- **Coins (¢)**: Earned from card Basic Benefits; used to purchase cards, Ink, or Adverts. Unused Coins are lost at end of turn.  
- **Prestige (★)**: Scored from Prestige cards and other sources; tracked on Prestige Tracker. First to 60★ triggers endgame.  
- **Offer Row**: 7 face-up cards available for purchase. After purchase, replace with top card from Offer Deck. If deck empties, reshuffle non-starter cards into new deck.  
- **Flush Offer Row**: Before purchasing, you may remove all 7 Offer Row cards if:  
  - All cost 6¢ or more, OR  
  - At least 4 are the same genre  
  Then draw 7 new cards. Only once per turn.  
- **Timeless Classic Cards**: Identified by horizontal text. When played face-up in a word, they stay in play and provide ongoing Basic Benefits. Genre Benefits apply if you play another card of matching genre or have another in-play Timeless Classic of same genre. Any player may use any in-play Timeless Classic as a letter (but gains no benefits). The owner keeps gaining benefits unless the card is used by another player, which sends it to the owner’s discard pile.  
- **Ink Tokens**:  
  - Buy: 1¢ per Ink  
  - Use:  
    - Spend 1 Ink to draw 1 card (place Ink on card). Must use all Ink-drawn cards in next word.  
    - Spend 3 Ink during Purchase phase to gain 1 Coin  
  - If you cannot use all Ink-drawn cards, you must pass: discard all cards, return Ink, draw new hand  
- **Remover Tokens**:  
  - Gain only by playing Horror cards with "Take Ink or Remover"  
  - Spend 1 Remover to cancel 1 Ink token on a drawn card; card returns to hand and can be used or made wild normally  
  - Return both Remover and Ink to supply after use  
- **Card Genres**:  
  - **Mystery (blue, magnifying glass)**:  
    - Uncover Adjacent Wild: reveal one adjacent face-down card and gain its benefits  
    - Jail Offer-Row Card: remove one card from Offer Row and reserve it in your jail (you may buy it; others cannot). Only one jailed card allowed.  
  - **Horror (green, skull)**:  
    - Take Ink or Remover: gain one token of your choice  
    - Gain Coin or Prestige: choose to gain either Coins or Prestige as indicated  
  - **Adventure (yellow, compass)**:  
    - Immediate Prestige: gain Prestige when purchased (shown on card)  
    - Trash This Card: after playing face-up, trash it to gain bonus Coin or Prestige  
  - **Romance (red, heart/arrow)**:  
    - Trash Another Card: trash one card from discard pile to gain 1 Coin  
    - Double Adjacent Card: double Coins and Prestige of one adjacent face-up card. If two such cards double the same card, it triples.  
- **Player Powers (Variant)**:  
  - Pay Ink cost to activate.  
  - Passive Powers: may use multiple times per turn  
  - Aggressive Powers: only once per turn

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when any player reaches 60 Prestige. Complete the round so all players have equal turns (ending with player to right of first player).  
- Final scoring:  
  - Total Prestige from cards, Adverts, and active Literary Award (only one can be active)  
  - Prestige from Literary Awards does not count toward ending the game  
- Winner: player with most Prestige  
- Tiebreaker: player with most remaining Ink tokens wins  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use a wild card from my hand with Ink on it?** No. Cards drawn with Ink must be used face-up and cannot be wild.  
- **Do I gain benefits from another player’s Timeless Classic?** No. You may use it as a letter, but gain no Basic or Genre Benefits, and it does not count toward your own genre combos.  
- **Can I use multiple Player Powers in one turn?** Yes, as long as they are Passive. Aggressive Powers are limited to once per turn.  
- **What happens if I can’t form a word with Ink-drawn cards?** You must pass: discard all cards, return Ink to supply, draw new hand.  
- **Can I flush the Offer Row after buying a card?** No. Flush must be done before any purchases.  
- **Can I use Remover on a card before my turn?** Yes. You may use Remover at any time before spelling your next word.  
- **Do unused Coins carry over?** No. All unused Coins are lost at end of turn.
