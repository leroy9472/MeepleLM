### 1. Lore & Objective
Rallyman: GT is a high-speed racing board game where players compete to be the first across the finish line. Using a unique dice mechanic, players must balance risk and strategy while navigating dangerous corners, weather conditions, and rival drivers. The core gameplay revolves around managing speed, avoiding Loss of Control, and using tactical maneuvers to outpace opponents.

### 2. Components
- 1 Rulebook  
- 12 Dashboards (6 standard, 6 for variants)  
- 6 Driver cards  
- 31 double-sided Track tiles  
- 1 Pit Stop tile  
- 6 cars  
- 11 Dice: 6 black Gear dice, 3 white Coast dice, 2 red Brake dice  
- 160 Focus tokens  
- 1 Round marker  
- 1 Damage token bag  
- 42 Damage tokens (6 Gear, 6 Brake, 6 Coast, 12 Green Flags, 6 Yellow Flags, 6 Weather, 6 optional Boost)  

### 3. Setup
1. **Build the Track**: Assemble 12–21 hexagonal track tiles depending on desired race length. Place the Pit Stop tile adjacent but not part of the circuit.  
2. **Prepare Tokens**: Place Focus tokens in piles and Damage tokens in the bag.  
3. **Assign Players**: Each player chooses a color, takes matching car, Driver card, Gear markers, and Asphalt tire Dashboard (set to Sunny).  
4. **Starting Order**: Draw Gear markers randomly to determine starting grid. Pole Position is the inside lane of the first corner.  
5. **Gear & Round Markers**: Place "0" Gear marker (white side up) next to each car. Set Round marker to white side up.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- **Rounds**: Alternating white and black rounds. The Round marker tracks current phase.  
- **Turn Order**: Determined at start of each round by:  
  1. **Speed** (highest Gear plays first)  
  2. **Distance** (furthest along track)  
  3. **Position** (inside lane of next corner)  
- **Player Turn**:  
  1. Choose dice (Gear, Coast, Brake) based on Dashboard.  
  2. Roll dice one at a time or Flat Out (all at once).  
  3. Move car accordingly.  
  4. End turn by placing Gear marker of next round’s color.  

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Dice Usage
- **Gear Dice (Black)**: Accelerate/decelerate. Must be played in order. Move 1 space per die.  
- **Coast Dice (White)**: Maintain speed. Move 1 space. Cannot be used at 0 or 00 Gear.  
- **Brake Dice (Red)**: Skip gears when combined with Gear die. One Brake die per skipped gear.  

#### Movement Rules
- Only one car per space.  
- Move forward only (straight or diagonal).  
- Change lanes freely unless restricted.  
- Must obey corner speed limits:  
  - **Normal Corner**: Cannot exceed marked gear.  
  - **Dangerous Corner (!)**: At max gear, add 1 △ to roll.  
  - **Sharp Corner**: Crossing dotted line changes speed limit. Diagonal movement avoids penalty.  

#### Overtaking
- To move adjacent: your Gear ≥ opponent’s Gear.  
- Diagonal overtaking between two cars allowed.  

#### Going Flat Out
- Roll all dice at once.  
- Gain 1 Focus token per black or white die used (not red).  
- If △ count ≥ Dashboard limit → Loss of Control.  
- Player may reposition dice to choose where LoC occurs.  

#### Focus Tokens
- Earned only by going Flat Out.  
- Used to "secure" dice when rolling one at a time:  
  - 1st die: 1 token, 2nd: 2 tokens, etc.  
- Cannot secure Brake rolls unless all involved dice are secured.  
- Cannot ignore △ from track effects.  

#### Loss of Control (LoC)
Triggered by:
- Rolling ≥ △ limit on Dashboard.  
- Exceeding corner speed limit.  

**Resolution**:
- **0 Gear**: Car faces backward on track. Next turn: turn forward and play normally.  
- **00 Gear**: Car placed off-track. Next turn: place back on track facing backward. Turn forward on following turn.  
- Draw Damage tokens based on tile Danger Level and current Gear.  

#### Damage Tokens
- **Gear/Brake/Coast Damage**: Reduce available dice of that type by 1.  
- **Yellow Flag**: Prevents overtaking until car moves.  
- **Weather Change**: Flip all Dashboards.  
- **Green Flag**: No effect.  

#### Pit Stops
Must end turn in 1st Gear at edge of track (not corner). Options:
- **Tire Change**: Swap Dashboard. Use 0 Gear marker. Return next turn.  
- **Repairs**: Remove all Damage tokens. Use 00 Gear marker. Return after one full turn.  
- **Repairs + Tire Change**: Combine both. Use 00 Gear marker.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: First player to cross finish line during their turn wins.  
- **Solo Mode**: Score based on time:  
  - Track Time: Sum of time per final Gear (e.g., 6th Gear = 10 sec/turn).  
  - Subtract 1 second per Focus token.  
  - Lowest final time wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Blocked Movement**: If cannot overtake due to Gear/space, movement ends immediately.  
- **Returning from 00**: If space occupied, flip marker and lose another turn.  
- **Flat Out LoC**: May reposition dice to avoid dangerous tiles.  
- **Weather Change**: Affects all players immediately.  
- **Flying Start**: From 0 Gear, may jump to 2nd Gear. If △ rolled on 2nd die, move 1 space and end turn in 2nd Gear (no LoC).
