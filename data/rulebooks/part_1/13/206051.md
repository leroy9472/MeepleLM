## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
INSIDER is a social deduction game inspired by the 20 Questions format. One player, the Insider, knows the secret Theme from the start. The other players (Commons) must deduce the Theme by asking yes/no questions through the Master. The group must then identify who the Insider is. The goal varies by role:
- The Master and Commons win by correctly identifying the Insider.
- The Insider wins by remaining hidden.
- In the Advanced Variant, there may be no Insider — in which case, correctly identifying the removed tile as such leads to a group win.

2. Components  
- 1 Master Tile  
- 1 Insider Tile  
- Multiple Common Tiles (one per player)  
- Theme Deck (cards with themes and numbers)  
- Hourglass (5-minute timer)  

3. Setup  
1. Assign Role Tiles:  
   - Give each player one tile face-down: one receives the Insider Tile, one the Master Tile, and the rest receive Common Tiles.  
2. Master Reveals Role:  
   - The Master announces their role. All other players close their eyes.  
3. Reveal Theme:  
   - The Master shuffles the deck and flips the top card.  
   - The Theme is the word matching the number on the new top card.  
4. Reveal to Insider:  
   - The Master closes their eyes.  
   - The Master instructs the Insider to open their eyes, look at the Theme, then close them again.  
   - The Master counts silently to 5.  
5. Conceal Theme:  
   - The Master opens their eyes, places the revealed card back on top of the deck face-down, and covers its number with the Master Tile.  
6. Begin Game:  
   - The Master tells all players to open their eyes. The game proceeds to the Q&A Phase.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in three phases:

**Phase 1: Q&A Phase**  
- The Master flips the 5-minute hourglass.  
- Any player may ask the Master a question about the Theme.  
- The Master answers only:  
  - “Yes”  
  - “No”  
  - “I DON’T KNOW”  
- The Insider must ask questions that subtly guide the group without revealing foreknowledge.  
- The Commons must deduce the Theme and observe questioning patterns to identify the Insider.

**End of Q&A Phase – Two Outcomes:**  
- **Failure:** If the hourglass runs out before the Theme is guessed, proceed to “If Q&A Failed” procedure.  
- **Success:** A player correctly guesses the Theme. That player becomes **The Guesser**.  
  - The Master flips the hourglass to begin the Discussion Phase.

**Phase 2: Discussion Phase**  
- All players (including the Master) discuss who they believe the Insider is.  
- Discussion ends when all are finished or the hourglass runs out.

**Phase 3: Voting Phase**  
Two votes occur:

**Vote #1: Judge the Guesser**  
- All players **except the Guesser** vote:  
  - “Yes” (they believe the Guesser was the Insider)  
  - “No” (they believe the Guesser was not the Insider)  
- A **majority** is required for a decision.  
- Tied votes do **not** count as a majority.

**Vote #2: Find the Insider**  
- The Master counts to 3. On “3”, all players (including the Guesser) point simultaneously at who they believe is the Insider.  
- Outcomes:  
  - If the player with the most votes **is** the Insider → Master and Commons win.  
  - If the player with the most votes **is not** the Insider → Insider wins.  
  - If there is a **tie** for most votes → the Guesser casts the deciding vote.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Information Asymmetry:** Only the Insider and Master know the Theme initially.  
- **Questioning Strategy:** Questions must be factual and answerable with “Yes,” “No,” or “I DON’T KNOW.”  
- **Deception & Detection:** The Insider must blend in; the Commons must detect behavioral clues.  
- **Simultaneous Voting:** Prevents last-moment influence during the final vote.

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Standard Game (Insider Present):**  
- If Q&A succeeds:  
  - Master and Commons win if the Insider is correctly identified.  
  - Insider wins if misidentified or if tie vote is resolved in their favor.  
- If Q&A fails:  
  - All non-Master players give a one-sentence defense.  
  - The Master flips one tile:  
    - If it’s the Insider Tile → Master and Commons win.  
    - Otherwise → everyone loses.

**Advanced Variant (Possibly No Insider):**  
- Before dealing tiles:  
  - Remove the Master Tile.  
  - Swap one random Common Tile with the remaining Common Tile (effectively removing the Insider Tile from play).  
  - Place the removed tile (possibly the Insider) face-down.  
  - Return the Master Tile and deal as normal.  
- If Q&A succeeds:  
  - The Guesser may look at **one** tile (another player’s or the removed tile).  
  - They may discuss what they saw, truthfully or deceptively.  
  - During Vote #2, players may point to the **removed tile** to vote that it was the Insider.  
  - Outcomes:  
    - If a **majority votes the removed tile** and it was the Insider → everyone wins.  
    - If a **majority votes a player** but the removed tile was the Insider → everyone loses.  
    - Otherwise, win conditions are as in the standard game.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can the Master be the Guesser?**  
  No. The Master knows the Theme but cannot guess it. Only Commons or the Insider may become the Guesser.  
- **Can the Guesser lie about what they saw in the Advanced Variant?**  
  Yes. The Guesser may truthfully or falsely describe the tile they viewed.  
- **What happens if the Guesser is the Insider?**  
  They become the Guesser upon correct guess. They still participate in discussion and voting.  
- **Tied vote in Vote #2:**  
  The Guesser breaks the tie by pointing to who they believe is the Insider.  
- **What if no one guesses the Theme?**  
  The Q&A Phase ends in failure when the timer runs out. Proceed to the Q&A Failure procedure.  
- **Can players ask compound questions?**  
  The rules do not forbid it, but questions must be answerable with “Yes,” “No,” or “I DON’T KNOW.” Ambiguous or unanswerable questions may be ruled “I DON’T KNOW.”
