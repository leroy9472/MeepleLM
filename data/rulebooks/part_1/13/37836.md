## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players take control of Julius Caesar or Pompey during the Roman Civil War (49–45 BC). The objective is to be the first to reach 10 Victory Points (VPs) or, if no one reaches 10 by the end of Year 5, to have the most VPs. VPs are scored from controlled cities (each worth 1 or 2 VPs) and from enemy leaders killed (1 VP each). If tied, the player holding Rome wins; if still tied, the game is a draw.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each Year consists of 5 Game Turns. Each Game Turn has 3 Phases:  
1. Card Phase  
2. Command Phase (Player 1, then Player 2)  
3. Battle Phase  
After 5 Game Turns, a Winter Turn is played. The game ends after Year 5 or when a player reaches 10 VPs.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Card Phase:  
  - Both players play 1 card face-down. Reveal simultaneously.  
  - Player with higher Move value becomes Player 1.  
  - Event card beats any Command card for Player 1 status.  
  - If both play Event cards, the turn ends immediately.  
  - Ties go to Caesar.  
  - Players may use fewer Moves/Levies than shown.  
- Command Phase:  
  - Player 1 moves and levies, then Player 2.  
  - Move: Each Move Point (MP) allows one group (all blocks in a location) to move.  
    - Land: 1 or 2 cities; Navis: 1 or 2 seas.  
    - Moving 2 spaces prevents attack or reinforcement.  
    - Must stop upon entering enemy or contested space.  
    - After moving, turn block face-down to indicate used.  
  - Road Limits:  
    - Major roads (solid): 4 blocks per turn per player.  
    - Minor roads (dotted): 2 blocks per turn per player.  
    - Straits: 2 blocks per turn (1 if attacking).  
  - Amphibious Movement:  
    - Land blocks move from one port to another across friendly seas.  
    - Cost: 1 MP per block.  
    - Must be done before any other movement.  
    - Seas used must already be friendly.  
    - Cannot move by land and sea in same turn.  
    - At least 1 Navis must remain in the sea crossed during Command Phase.  
  - Levy:  
    - Each Levy Point (LP) allows:  
      - Add 1 step to an existing block, or  
      - Deploy 1 new block at strength I from Levy Pool.  
    - Multiple steps can be added to one block.  
    - New blocks must be placed in friendly cities.  
    - Unit-specific recruitment:  
      - Leaders: Any friendly city  
      - Legions, Equitatus, Elephant: Their named city (must be friendly)  
      - Auxilia, Ballista: Any friendly city  
      - Navis: Friendly major port (marked with Navis symbol)  
      - Steps can be added to Navis in any port, but never at sea.  
- Battle Phase:  
  - Player 1 chooses battle order.  
  - Battles occur in contested cities or seas.  
  - Battle Rounds (up to 4):  
    - Round 1: No retreats. Reserves not involved.  
    - Round 2: Reserves arrive. Retreats allowed.  
    - Round 3: Normal combat.  
    - Round 4: Attacker must retreat if not victorious.  
  - Combat Sequence: A > B > C > D. Defender’s units of each letter go first.  
  - Hits:  
    - Roll d6 equal to current strength.  
    - Hit on roll ≤ combat number (e.g., A3 hits on 1–3).  
    - Each hit reduces the strongest enemy block. Owner chooses if tied.  
  - Reserves:  
    - Attacker’s secondary attacks or Player 2 reinforcements.  
    - Not revealed or active in Round 1.  
    - If main force is eliminated in Round 1, reserves are disrupted: lose 1 step, then fight normally.  
    - If defending main force is eliminated, attacker becomes defender.  
  - Retreats:  
    - Not allowed in Round 1.  
    - Road limits apply.  
    - Cannot retreat to enemy or contested areas.  
    - Across strait: max 1 block per round.  
    - Attacker: To adjacent vacant city via attack route, or any friendly adjacent city.  
    - Defender: To any adjacent friendly or vacant city, but not via attacker’s route.  
    - Sea Retreat: 1 land block per round across friendly sea to friendly port on same sea.  
  - Regroups:  
    - Victor may move any victorious blocks (including reserves) to adjacent friendly or vacant city.  
    - Road limits apply. No amphibious regroup.  
    - Navis: Can regroup to adjacent friendly/vacant sea or port on same sea.  
  - Navis Battles:  
    - Same as land battles. Defender goes first.  
    - Navis can attack/defend in ports from adjacent sea.  
    - Retreats:  
      - Attacker: To origin, friendly adjacent sea, or friendly port on same sea.  
      - Defender: To friendly adjacent sea, vacant adjacent sea (not attacker’s route), or friendly port on same sea.  
- Cleopatra:  
  - Not a leader. Starts with Pompey.  
  - If eliminated, joins other side at strength I and fights next round.  
  - Each Winter Turn, moves to Alexandria. If enemy-occupied, joins that side at current strength.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After each Winter Turn, check for victory:  
  - Score VPs = total value of friendly cities + 1 VP per enemy leader killed.  
  - Win immediately if ≥10 VPs.  
- If no one wins by end of Year 5:  
  - Highest VP wins.  
  - Tie: Player holding Rome wins.  
  - Still tied: Draw.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I use fewer Moves/Levies than my card shows?  
  Yes. You may use any number up to the card’s value.  
- What happens to eliminated blocks?  
  Non-leader blocks return to owner’s Levy Pool face-up; cannot be levied again this year.  
  Leaders are permanently eliminated and given to opponent as 1 VP trophy.  
- When a leader is killed, what happens?  
  The third leader enters the killer’s Levy Pool and can be recruited normally.  
- Can Cleopatra be in the Levy Pool?  
  No. If eliminated, she immediately joins the other side at strength I.  
- Can I disband blocks during Winter Turn?  
  Yes. Any block (except Cleopatra) can be disbanded to Levy Pool. Steps are lost, but block can be rebuilt next year.  
- What happens to Navis that can’t reach a port in Winter Turn?  
  They are disbanded to Levy Pool and can be rebuilt next year.  
- Can blocks move two spaces and then attack later?  
  No. Moving two spaces means you cannot attack or reinforce.  
- Can Navis move directly port-to-port?  
  No. They must move via adjacent sea.
