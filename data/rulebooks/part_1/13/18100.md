### 1. Lore & Objective

In 200 B.C., China is in a state of political unrest. Regional rulers grow powerful while the Emperor’s authority weakens. Players take on the roles of ambitious warlords vying for dominance. The goal is to gain the most victory points (VP) through strategic placement of houses, emissaries, and control of alliances and roads. Victory leads to becoming the new Emperor.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Playing Cards
- **1 card**: place 1 piece in a region of matching color.
- **2 cards of same color**: act as a "joker" — place 1 piece in a region of **any other** color.
- **3 cards**: must include at least 2 of the same color (the third can be any color, acting as a wild). Place up to 2 pieces in one region (1 per card used).
- You may not place pieces in multiple regions per turn.

#### Placing Pieces
- **Only one region per turn.**
- **Empty region**: only 1 piece may be placed.
- **Occupied region**: up to 2 pieces may be placed (1 per card played).
- **House**: must be placed on an empty house space.
- **Emissary**: placed on the dragon space.
  - Max emissaries allowed = number of houses of the majority player in that region.
  - You may place an emissary even without houses, but **no emissaries allowed in regions with 0 houses**.
- **Fortification**:
  - Placed on empty house space.
  - Must be played using a card of the region’s color or a joker.
  - Neutral until a house is placed on it.
  - It is recommended to place a house on a fortification the same turn.

#### Scoring a Region (House Scoring)
Triggered when **all house spaces in a region are filled**.

Scoring:
- 1st place (most houses): +1 VP per **total** house in region (all colors).
- 2nd place: +1 VP per house of the 1st-place player.
- 3rd place: +1 VP per house of the 2nd-place player.
- 4th place: +1 VP per house of the 3rd-place player.
- 5th place: +1 VP per house of the 4th-place player.

Ties:
- Tied players receive equal points for their position.
- Lower positions still score based on actual rankings (no skipping).

Bonuses:
- **Double points** if the player has a house with a **fortification** in the region.

After scoring, place a scoring marker on the region. Players may still add emissaries.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

**Game End:**
- Ends when the draw pile is exhausted for the **second time**.
- Play continues until the player to the right of the start player has taken their turn (equal turns).
- Final scoring follows.

**Final Scoring:**

1. **House Scoring**  
   Score any region **without** a scoring marker, using the same rules as during the game.

2. **Alliance Scoring**  
   - 15 alliances (numbered 1–15) connect adjacent regions.
   - Use the Emperor marker to score alliances in order (1 to 15).
   - To score an alliance, a player must have **majority of emissaries** in **both** connected regions.
     - In case of a tie, all tied players are considered to have majority.
   - The scoring player receives **1 VP per emissary** (of any color) in **both regions**.
   - Multiple players can score the same alliance if they each have majorities in both regions.
   - Players without majority in both regions score nothing.

3. **Road Scoring**
   - Score each uninterrupted row of **at least 4 houses**.
   - Houses must be connected by roads; branches do not count.
   - Rows can span multiple regions.
   - **+1 VP per house** in the row.
   - **Double VP** if the row includes **at least one house on a fortification**.

**Final Tiebreaker:**
- Most VP wins.
- Tie: player with the most **remaining pieces** (houses, emissaries, fortification) wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can I place a fortification without placing a house on it?**  
  Yes, but another player may later place their house on it.

- **Can I place emissaries in a region where I have no houses?**  
  Yes, as long as the region has at least one house (so a majority exists).

- **Can I score a region multiple times?**  
  No. Only once, when it is first filled. Mark it with a scoring token.

- **Can I use a joker to place a piece in a region of the same color?**  
  No. A pair of same-color cards as a joker can only be used to place in a **different** color region.

- **Can I score multiple alliances with one emissary majority?**  
  Yes. If a player has emissary majorities in multiple adjacent pairs, they can score each valid alliance.

- **Can a road double back?**  
  No. The path must be uninterrupted and cannot loop or double back.

- **What happens if the face-up cards are taken during a card draw?**  
  Refill the face-up row to 4 cards only after the player finishes drawing.

- **Can I place two pieces in an empty region?**  
  No. Only 1 piece may be placed in a region with no prior pieces.
