## Genotype: A Mendelian Genetics Game — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Genotype: A Mendelian Genetics Game*, players take on the role of research scientists at the monastery where Gregor Mendel conducted his pioneering genetics experiments. Each player manages a garden of pea plants with specific genetic traits (genotypes), represented by letter pairs (e.g., RR, Rr, rr).  

**Objective**: Score the most points by the end of Round 5 by validating all traits on pea plants (covering them with trait markers), completing phenotype research goals, and efficiently managing resources.  

Points are scored from:  
- Completed Pea Plant Cards (printed value)  
- Phenotype Research Goals (bonus points per matching completed plant)  
- 1 point per trait marker on incomplete plants  
- 1 point per unspent coin  

**Tiebreaker**: Most completed pea plants. If still tied, share the victory.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A game lasts 5 Rounds. Each Round has 3 Phases:  

1. **Working Phase** – Players place Action Markers to take actions.  
2. **Plant Breeding Phase** – Players draft Offspring Dice to validate traits.  
3. **Research Upgrade Phase** – Players buy permanent upgrades (Rounds 1–4 only).  
4. **End of Round Reset** – Prepare for next Round.  

After Round 5, proceed to final scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Working Phase  
- Players take turns placing **1 Action Marker** on an available space (clockwise from First Player).  
- Once placed, the action is taken immediately.  
- Continue until all players have placed all Action Markers.  
- Actions (in any order):  

| Action | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Gardening** | 1. Draw 1 Pea Plant or Tool Card (face-up or deck).<br>2. Harvest completed Pea Plants (all traits validated).<br>3. Sow 1+ Pea Plants from hand to Garden Plots. |
| **Temporary Dice Slot** | Unlock 1 extra Dice Slot for this Round only (no immediate effect). |
| **Set Parent Genes** | Add, remove, or leave 1 Parent Gene Tile on a Punnett Square. May not flip existing tile. Take Coin if present. |
| **1st Shift** | Reserve 1st pick of Offspring Dice of matching color. Take Coin if present. |
| **2nd Shift** | Reserve early pick (after 1st Shift). Unlimited players may place here. Resolve right-to-left. Take Coin if present. |
| **Set Phenotype Research Goal** | Pay 2 or 3 Coins. Place 1 Phenotype Research Marker on an unclaimed goal. Score bonus at game end. |
| **Treasury** | Gain 2 Coins. |
| **University** | Pay 1 or 2 Coins to validate 1 trait on any of your Pea Plants. |
| **Nursery** | Draw 2 Pea Plant Cards (any combo of face-up or deck). |
| **Tool Shed** | Draw 1 Tool Card (face-up or deck). |

- **Tool Cards** (may be played during your turn, do not replace action):  
  - *Seed Bag*: Draw 5 Pea Plants, keep 2, discard rest.  
  - *Watering Funnel*: Validate 1 trait (must play immediately when drawn).  
  - *Dissertation*: Pay 1 Coin to Set Phenotype Research Goal.  
  - *Flower Pot*: Place Plant Card on it (acts as extra Plot; discarded after Harvest).  
  - *Graft Knife*: When taking a Die, take a second (no Dice Slot needed).  
  - *Rake*: When taking a Die, validate any trait of that color.  
  - *Pollen Brush*: When validating a trait, validate all copies of that genotype.  
  - *Hand Lens / Pocket Watch / Garden Line*: When taking Parent Genes / 1st Shift / 2nd Shift, gain 2 Coins.  
  - *Grant*: When buying Upgrade, reduce cost by 2 Coins.  

#### Plant Breeding Phase  
1. **Roll and Sort**:  
   - Roll all 20 Offspring Dice.  
   - For each die:  
     - I–IV → Match to Punnett Square, place in Dice Pool Area for that genotype.  
     - Mutation (ℵ) → Re-roll once. If I–IV, place normally. If ℵ again, place in **De Novo Mutations Area** for that color.  

2. **Select Dice in Order**:  
   - **1st Shift**: Players with markers pick 1 Die of matching color.  
   - **2nd Shift**: Players pick 1 Die each, right-to-left order.  
   - **Normal Order**: Starting with First Player, clockwise. Each player picks 1 Die per turn.  

3. **Taking a Die**:  
   - Must have available **Dice Slot**.  
   - Must use Die to **validate a matching uncovered trait** on your Pea Plant.  
   - Place Die in a Dice Slot.  
   - Cover trait with **Trait Marker**.  

4. **De Novo Mutation (ℵ) Options**:  
   - **Gain 1 Coin**: Take only the ℵ Die, place in Dice Slot. No trait validated.  
   - **Mutate**: Take ℵ Die + 1 normal Die of same color → Validate **any trait** of that color (even if impossible). Use 2 Dice Slots.  
   - ℵ Die may mutate another ℵ Die of same color.  

5. **Passing**: If no valid pick or no Dice Slots, pass. Once passed, cannot act again this Phase.

#### Research Upgrade Phase (Rounds 1–4 only)  
- **Reverse order**: First player to act is to the right of First Player Marker; counter-clockwise.  
- On your turn:  
  - May buy **1 Upgrade** by paying current price.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End of Round 5**: After Plant Breeding Phase, skip Research Upgrade Phase.  

**Final Steps**:  
- Harvest any completed Pea Plants.  
- **Scoring**:
