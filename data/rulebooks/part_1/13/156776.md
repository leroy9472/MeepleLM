### 1. Lore & Objective
Warhammer 40,000: Conquest is a two-player Living Card Game set in the grim darkness of the far future. Players take on the role of Warlords commanding armies from factions across the Warhammer 40K universe. The objective is to achieve victory by either:
- Winning three planets that share a common icon type (Material, Strongpoint, or Tech), or
- Eliminating the opponent’s Warlord (by defeating it twice: first to Bloodied, then again while Bloodied), or
- Causing the opponent to run out of cards in their deck.

If both players meet a winning condition simultaneously, the game ends in a tie. Otherwise, the player who most recently added a planet to their victory display wins.

### 2. Components
- 2 Player Decks (each 60 cards minimum)
- Warlord Cards (1 per player)
- 10 Planet Cards
- Resource Tokens
- Damage Tokens
- Token Units (e.g., Guardsman, Drone)
- Command Dials (1 per player)
- Initiative Token
- First Planet Token
- Victory Display Area

### 3. Setup
1. Each player selects a deck. When using core set starter decks, include all faction cards and one copy of each Neutral card.
2. Place Warlord in HQ area, hale side up. Shuffle deck and place beside Warlord.
3. Shuffle 10 planet cards, deal 7 face down in a line. Remove the remaining 3 from the game.
4. Randomly determine first player, who takes the Initiative Token.
5. First player turns the first 5 planets face up (left to right) and places the First Planet Token on the leftmost planet.
6. Each player draws a hand equal to their Warlord’s starting hand size (typically 5). One mulligan allowed.
7. Each player takes starting resources equal to their Warlord’s resource value (typically 7).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of four phases:

#### 1. Deploy Phase
- Starting with the player with Initiative, players alternate:
  - Deploy 1 card from hand,
  - Use 1 Action ability, or
  - Pass.
- Passing ends your turn; both players must pass to end the phase.
- Pay resource cost to deploy cards. Cards enter play ready.

#### 2. Command Phase
- **Step 1: Commitment**
  - Each player secretly selects a planet number on their command dial.
  - Reveal dials simultaneously.
  - Move Warlord and all HQ units to the chosen planet.
  - Warlord arrives in current state; all other units arrive exhausted.
- **Step 2: Command Struggles**
  - For each faceup planet in order:
    - If only one player has a ready Warlord, that player wins.
    - Else, player with more ready Command Icons (hammers) wins.
    - Tie = no winner.
  - Winner may claim resource and/or card bonus.

#### 3. Combat Phase
- Fight battles in order:
  - Always at the First Planet.
  - At any other planet where at least one Warlord is present.
- **Battle Resolution:**
  - Determine initiative: Warlord present = battle initiative. If both or neither, Initiative Token holder has it.
  - **Ranged Skirmish (only in first combat round):**
    - Starting with initiative player, players alternate using ready Ranged units to attack or pass.
    - Ends when both pass.
  - **Combat Rounds:**
    - Starting with initiative player, players alternate attacking with ready units or passing.
    - After all pass, ready all units.
    - Each player (starting with initiative) may retreat any number of units to HQ (exhausted).
    - Repeat until one player has no units at the planet.
  - **Winning a Battle:**
    - At First Planet: Place planet in victory display. Surviving units return to HQ.
    - At other planets: Winner may resolve the planet’s Battle ability. Warlord returns to HQ if it was committed.
  - **Warlord Retreat:** May exhaust to retreat at any attack opportunity. Ends your combat turn.

#### 4. Headquarters Phase
1. Move First Planet Token to the leftmost faceup planet.
2. Reveal the next facedown planet (if any).
3. Each player draws 2 cards.
4. Each player gains 4 resources.
5. Ready all exhausted cards.
6. Pass Initiative Token to the other player.
