## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
The game is set in the Cthulhu Mythos, where ancient horrors rise and threaten humanity. The solo variant, Cthulhu Rising, pits the player against an AI-controlled Minion faction. The objective is to win 3 story cards before your opponent does. The Minion acts as a relentless, self-harming opponent that follows deterministic rules to simulate a challenging solo experience.

### 2. Components
- Player and Minion decks (50+ cards, 60–65% characters)
- Story deck (3 story cards in play at a time)
- Domains (3 player domains, 3 Minion domains + 1 Events Domain)
- Resources (cards attached to domains; dice for Minion domains)
- Success and wound tokens
- Character, Support, Event, and Conspiracy cards
- Dice (for Minion resource generation)

### 3. Setup
1. Shuffle both player and Minion decks.
2. Place the game board between players; place tokens in "The Deep."
3. Shuffle and place 3 story cards faceup; rest form the story deck.
4. **Minion Setup:**
   - Draw from Minion deck until first 3-cost character is found; place it in play (forward scout).
   - Shuffle remaining drawn cards back.
   - Minion starts with 4 domains: 3 standard, 1 Events Domain.
   - Events Domain starts at 2 resources (3 if player takes a Mulligan).
   - Draw 5 cards for Minion; place Events drawn into the Events Pool (faceup under Events Domain).
   - Place dice on domains showing 2 (or 3 if Mulligan taken).
5. **Player Setup:**
   - Draw 8 cards; choose 5 for starting hand (Mulligan allowed once).
   - Attach 1 of remaining 3 cards (faceup, upside down) to each of 3 domains as starting resources.
6. **Determine First Player:**
   - Flip token: Skull = Minion starts; Magnifying Glass = Player starts.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- **Minion Turn (if starting):**
  - Refresh → Draw 2 → Manage Events Pool → Resource Phase (roll die to increase one domain) → Operations → Story Phase
- **Player Turn:**
  - Refresh → Draw 2 → Resource (optional) → Operations → Story Phase
- Turns alternate until one player wins 3 story cards or opponent deck is empty.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Character Potential (CP)
Used to prioritize character use:
- CP = Cost + Skill
- Tiebreakers (in order):
  1. + Investigation
  2. + Investigation + Terror
  3. + Investigation + Terror + Combat
  4. + Investigation + Terror + Combat + Arcane
- If still tied, use character text box to determine highest benefit.

#### Minion Actions
- **Refresh Phase:**
  - Reset drained domains, unexhaust characters, set 1 insane character to exhausted (highest CP).
- **Draw Phase:**
  - Draw 2 cards; Events go to Events Pool.
- **Events Pool:**
  - Events drawn are placed faceup under Events Domain.
  - Playable if conditions are met; timing based on maximum impact.
- **Resource Phase:**
  - Roll die to increase one domain by 1 (reroll if invalid for >3 domains).
- **Operations Phase:**
  - Attempt to drain 2 domains (3 if Events Pool empty or no valid Events).
  - 1st drain: Highest CP character that can be paid for; else highest valid Support.
  - 2nd drain: Highest valid Support; else next highest CP character.
  - 3rd drain: Valid card action or high-cost Event.
  - Valid = card can be played (e.g., Support has target if required).
- **Story Phase:**
  - Commit from highest to lowest CP.
  - First commit to story with most Minion icons; if none, commit to story closest to Deep End.
  - Alternate committing and holding back for defense until all characters assigned.
  - Equal defense: commit until number of committed = number of player defenders.
- **Player Story Phase:**
  - Player commits first.
  - Minion defends every committed story, starting with story where player has most icons.
  - Defend using highest CP characters in descending order.

#### Attachments & Actions
- Attachments go to highest CP character without one; if all have, attach to highest CP.
- Card actions that exhaust characters are taken before commitment/defense.
- Unique characters: only one in play at a time.

#### Winning a Story
- Minion gains +1 resource in Events Domain.
- May choose story effect only if clearly beneficial.

#### Conspiracies
- Minion plays conspiracy closest to Deep End; player plays furthest.
- Each player may have 1 conspiracy in play.

#### Dormant Cards
- Treated per official rules; may be placed faceup at story.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Win by being first to win 3 story cards.
- A story card is won when a player has 5 or more success tokens on their side.
- If player runs out of cards, opponent wins immediately.
- Minion Events Domain increases by 1 when player wins a story.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **No Minion Characters in Play or Hand:**
  - Re-initialize play area, but use 4-cost character instead of 3.
- **Day/Night Cards:**
  - Minion decides based on benefit; characters restricted by day/night cannot be used.
- **Difficulty Adjustment:**
  - Increase/decrease starting resources, Events Domain, or scout cost.
  - Draw 3 cards per turn for Minion.
  - Use LILLITH variant for less randomness.
- **LILLITH Variant:**
  - Replaces "Potential" with "Priority" (based on cost, then icons, then alphabet).
  - Pre-determines event triggers.
  - Resourcing aims to maximize card play.
  - Outcome-based commit/defend logic.
