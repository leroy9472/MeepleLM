## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Codex is a customizable, non-collectable card game set in the Fantasy Strike universe. Players simulate real-time strategy gameplay by managing resources, constructing buildings, summoning heroes and units, and attacking the opponent’s base. The objective is to reduce the opponent’s base to 0 HP. Each player starts with a base of 20 HP (30 HP in 2v2 teams).

### 2. Components
- Playmats with labeled zones (command zone, draw area, discard pile, patrol zone)
- Hero cards (placed in command zone)
- Worker card (tracks number of workers)
- Starting deck (10 cards with a dot in the corner)
- Codex (stack of spec cards: spells, units, upgrades, tech buildings)
- Add-on cards (Tower, Surplus, Heroes’ Hall, Tech Lab)
- Gold markers (track gold, max 20)
- Damage and rune markers (track damage, levels, summoning runes, etc.)
- Tokens (e.g., Mercenaries, Skeletons, Stingers)

### 3. Setup
1. Place your hero cards in the command zone.
2. Place your worker card: Player 1 uses x4, Player 2 uses x5.
3. Shuffle your 10 starting cards (those with a dot) and place them in your draw area.
4. Both players draw 5 cards to form their opening hand.
5. Set base HP to 20 (30 in 2v2).
6. Place add-on cards (Tower, Surplus, Heroes’ Hall, Tech Lab) in the center.
7. Keep your codex (spec cards) beside your playmat, organized by spec.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn has five phases:
1. **Ready Phase**: Ready all exhausted cards.
2. **Upkeep Phase**: Gain 1 gold per worker (max 20), remove 1 summoning rune from each hero, resolve upkeep effects.
3. **Main Phase**: Perform actions in any order.
4. **Draw Phase**: Discard entire hand, then draw that many cards +2 (capped at 5).
5. **Tech Phase**: Choose up to 2 cards from your codex to tech in (face down); they go to discard pile at start of next turn. Optional once you have 10 workers.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Workers**: Start with 4 (P1) or 5 (P2). Hire 1 per turn by paying 1 gold and tucking a card from hand face down under worker card. Destroyed/sacrificed workers are trashed.
- **Heroes**:
  - Summoned from command zone (not from deck).
  - Start at level 1; level up for 1 gold (multiple times per turn).
  - Heal all damage when reaching mid or max level band.
  - Hero limit: Tech 1 = 1 hero, Tech 2 = 2, Tech 3 = 3.
  - If a hero dies, return to command zone (loses runes, levels); cannot be re-summoned until after next turn.
  - When opponent’s hero dies, one of your in-play heroes gains 2 levels (chosen by active player).
- **Tech Buildings**:
  - Construct in sequence: Tech I → Tech II → Tech III.
  - Must have required number of workers.
  - Finish construction at end of turn (arrival fatigue).
  - When destroyed, base takes 2 damage.
  - Can rebuild for 0 gold (still takes a turn).
  - At Tech II, choose a permanent spec; only cards of that spec may be played at Tech II/III.
- **Add-ons**:
  - Only one add-on at a time.
  - Finish construction at end of turn.
  - When destroyed or sacrificed, base takes 2 damage.
  - Can sacrifice own add-on to build a new one.
  - Multicolor teams pay +1 gold for first tech building or add-on.
- **Patrol Zone**:
  - 5 slots with different bonuses.
  - Only ready (non-exhausted) units/heroes may patrol.
  - Rearranged freely each turn; locking ends Main Phase.
  - Units only gain patrol bonuses during opponent’s turn.
- **Attacking**:
  - All cards have summoning sickness (cannot attack on arrival unless haste).
  - Attack one at a time.
  - Must attack squad leader if possible, then any patroller, else any unit, hero, or building.
  - Attacker and defender deal ATK damage simultaneously.
  - Exhaust attacker to attack.
  - Cannot attack from patrol zone.
- **Damage**:
  - Persistent across turns.
  - Armor absorbs damage before HP; squad leader armor refreshes each turn.
  - Armor Piercing ignores armor.
- **Spells**:
  - Require a hero in play.
  - Starting spells: any hero can cast; +1 gold if color mismatch.
  - Spec spells: only matching spec hero can cast.
  - Ultimate spells: only if hero was at max level at start of turn.
- **Tokens**:
  - Tech 0 units, come from card effects.
  - Do not go to discard pile when killed; can be stored in codex or trashed.
  - Unlimited supply; use proxies if needed.
- **Keywords**:
  - **Stealth/Invisible**: Can ignore patrollers if opponent lacks detector (e.g., Tower). Invisible also unattackable and untargetable.
  - **Tower**: Detects 1 stealth/invisible per turn; deals 1 combat damage to each visible attacker.
  - **Sparkshot**: When attacking a patroller, deals 1 damage to adjacent patroller (simultaneously).
  - **Overpower**: Excess combat damage to a patroller hits another legal target.
  - **Obliterate**: Destroys X lowest-tech enemy units before combat.
  - **Swift Strike**: Deals combat damage before non-swift units.
  - **Readiness**: Does not exhaust when attacking; can only attack once per turn.
  - **Haste**: Can attack on turn it arrives.
  - **Deathtouch**: Any combat damage kills the target.
  - **Fading**: Arrives with X time runes; remove 1 each upkeep; sacrifice when last is removed.
  - **Forecast**: Put into future with X time runes; remove 1 each upkeep; arrives when last is removed.
  - **Legendary**: Only one copy of same name can be in play.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Win by reducing opponent’s base to 0 HP.
- In Free-for-All (3–5 players): Game ends when any player’s base is destroyed; winner is player with most remaining base HP.
- In 2v2: Teams share a 30 HP base; destroy opposing team’s base to win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Tech Phase Timing**: Cards chosen during opponent’s turn; discarded at start of your next turn. Can delay choice until your next turn begins.
- **Hero Summoning**: Cannot summon a hero with summoning runes (from recent death).
- **Control vs. Ownership**: Owner is original player; controller is current player. When a card leaves play, it returns to owner.
- **Indestructible**: If destroyed, exhaust and remove damage/runes instead; cannot be sacrificed.
- **Two Lives**: First destruction removes damage and adds crumbling rune; second destruction kills it.
- **Free-for-All Rules**:
  - Gain 1 gold per enemy unit destroyed (max 3 per turn).
  - Pay 3 gold to repair 1 base damage.
  - Can lend patrollers to opponents’ patrol zones; return during that opponent’s upkeep.
- **2v2 Rules**:
  - Teammates take phases simultaneously.
  - Shared base; individual gold, decks, codexes.
  - Both players can build an add-on.
  - Team patrol zone protects shared base.
