### 1. Lore & Objective
In the alternate 1878 of Doomtown, the American Civil War is at a standstill, California has collapsed, and ghost rock powers unpredictable technology. Gomorra, a boomtown built on ghost rock, has been ravaged by conflict and supernatural forces. Players take on the role of leaders of rival outfits (e.g., Law Dogs, Sloane Gang) vying for control of Gomorra.

**Objective:** A player wins the game at the beginning of any Sundown phase if they have more **Control points** than the highest **Influence** total among the other players. In the event of a tie in this condition, the player with the most Control wins; if still tied, the player with the most Influence wins. If that is also tied, play continues for another day.

### 2. Components
*   **Outfit Cards:** Define a player's faction, starting resources, and special ability. Serves as the player's "Home."
*   **Deed Cards:** Represent buildings in Gomorra. Provide income (production), Control points, and special abilities. Can be Public or Private.
*   **Dude Cards:** Represent characters in play. Have a Suit, Value, Bullets (for shootouts), Influence (for control), and Upkeep cost. Can be unique.
*   **Goods Cards:** Items attached to Dudes (e.g., Weapons, Horses, Gadgets). Modify a Dude's stats or provide abilities.
*   **Spell Cards:** Magical abilities attached to specific Dudes (Hucksters, Blessed, Shamans).
*   **Action Cards:** One-time use events or tactics played from hand.
*   **Joker Cards:** Wildcards used only in draw hands (poker hands) and pulls. Never make a hand illegal.
*   **Counters:** Ghost Rock (currency), Control (blue), Influence (red), and Bounties (ghost rock).
*   **Player Boards:** Track phases, hand ranks, and movement rules.

### 3. Setup
1.  **Simultaneously Reveal:** Each player reveals their Outfit card, places it on the table as their Home, and collects the starting Ghost Rock stash.
2.  **Select Starting Dudes:** Each player searches their deck for up to 5 Dudes. These Dudes must be from their own Outfit or Drifters, with a maximum of 1 Grifter. The combined cost must be less than or equal to their starting stash.
3.  **Place and Pay:** Simultaneously place the selected Dudes at their Home. Pay their cost to the bank.
4.  **Draw Hand:** Shuffle the remaining deck and draw 5 cards into the Play Hand.
5.  **Optional:** Resolve any Grifter abilities in the starting posse.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
A game is played over a series of Days, each with four phases:
1.  **Gamblin':** Determines the "Winner" for the day.
2.  **Upkeep:** Collect income and pay upkeep costs.
3.  **High Noon:** The main action phase for playing cards, moving, and initiating conflicts.
4.  **Sundown:** Check for victory, refill hands, and prepare for the next day.

### 5. Core Mechanics
*   **Winner:** The player with the lowest poker hand rank in the Gamblin' phase. The Winner goes first in every phase, wins ties, and starts the High Noon phase.
*   **Play Hand:** A 5-card hand used for playing cards during the High Noon phase.
*   **Draw Hand:** A separate hand of cards drawn to form a poker hand for Gamblin', Shootouts, and Jobs. Cannot be played from.
*   **Ghost Rock (GR):** The game's currency, used to pay for cards and upkeep.
*   **Booting:** Turning a card 90 degrees to indicate it has been used. A booted card cannot use an ability that costs "Boot." Cards are unbooted at the end of each day.
*   **Controller vs. Owner:**
    *   **Owner:** The player who owns the card (their deck).
    *   **Controller:** The player who makes decisions for the card. For Deeds, the player with the most Influence at that Deed is the Controller. The Home is always controlled by its Owner.
*   **Uniqueness:** Most Dudes and Deeds are unique. A unique card cannot be in play if another copy is in play or in its owner's Boot Hill.
*   **Hand Ranks (Lowest to Highest in Gamblin', Highest to Lowest in Shootouts):**
    1.  High Card
    2.  One Pair
    3.  Two Pairs
    4.  Three of a Kind
    5.  Straight
    6.  Flush
    7.  Full House
    8.  Four of a Kind
    9.  Straight Flush
    10. Five of a Kind
    11. Dead Man's Hand (specific 5-card hand)
*   **Aces are Low:** In all poker hands, Aces count as 1.
*   **Cheatin' Hand:** A Draw Hand with two or more cards of the same Suit and Value (excluding Jokers). This makes the player vulnerable to "Cheatin' Resolution" abilities.
*   **Grit:** A Dude's toughness, calculated as Value + Bullets + Influence.

#### High Noon Plays
During the High Noon phase, players alternate making plays until all pass consecutively. Plays include:
*   **Actin':** Use a Noon ability from a card in play or an Action card in hand. Pay all costs (e.g., Boot, GR) before resolving.
*   **Callin' Out:** An unbooted Dude (Leader) challenges another player's Dude (Mark) at the same location (not the Mark's Home). The Mark can refuse by moving home booted (if unbooted) or must accept (if booted).
*   **Movin':** Move an unbooted Dude to any location. This boots the Dude, except for:
    *   Moving from Home to an adjacent location.
    *   Moving from Town Square to an adjacent in-town location (excluding Home).
*   **Shoppin':** Bring a card from your Play Hand into play.
    *   **Dude:** Starts at your Home.
    *   **Deed:** Placed at the end of your street (in-town) or out-of-town.
    *   **Goods:** Attached to an unbooted Dude at a location you control. A Dude can only have one Weapon and one Horse.
    *   **Gadgets:** Invented by a Mad Scientist (a Skill Check with cost to invent).
    *   **Spells:** Attached to a qualifying Dude (e.g., Hucksters for Hexes).
*   **Tradin':** Swap Goods cards between two Dudes you control at a location you control. Receiving Dudes must be unbooted. Cannot trade Spells. Goods cannot be traded again until the next day.

#### Shootouts
A Shootout begins when a Callin' Out is accepted. It is resolved in rounds.
1.  **Formin' Posse:** The Leader declares their posse first. Dudes can join from the same location (booted or unbooted) or adjacent locations (unbooted only). All Dudes joining from another location move and boot.
2.  **Breakin' and Enterin':** If the shootout is at a Private location not owned by a player, all of that player's Dudes in the shootout gain +1 Bounty (and become Wanted if 0).
3.  **Slingin' Lead (Per Round):**
    *   **Make Plays:** Players alternate using Shootout abilities until all pass.
    *   **Pick Yer Shooter:** The Leader and Mark each choose a Shooter from their posse (can be booted).
    *   **Draw!:** Each player draws a number of cards equal to 5 + their posse's Stud bonus. They may then discard and redraw up to their posse's Draw bonus. Finally, they discard down to 5 cards.
    *   **Reveal and Resolve:** Hands are revealed. Players use Reveal and Resolution abilities (including Cheatin' Resolution, max 1 per player per hand).
    *   **Take Yer Lumps:** The player with the highest hand rank wins. The difference in rank is the number of casualties the loser takes. If tied, both take 1 casualty. Casualties are covered by discarding (1 casualty) or acing (2 casualties) Dudes.
    *   **Run or Gun:** Starting with the loser, players choose which Dudes (if any) flee home booted.
    *   **Chamber Another Round:** If both posses have Dudes, start a new round.

#### Jobs
A Job is a special action initiated by a card ability (e.g., "Noon Job:"). It follows a similar structure to a shootout.
1.  **Start the Job:** Choose an unbooted Dude as the Leader.
2.  **Choose the Mark:** Determine the target of the Job.
3.  **Form Posses:** The Leader forms a posse first, then the Mark's controller (and potentially the Mark's owner or other players) forms an opposition posse.
4.  **Saddle Up:** All Dudes in both posses move to the Mark's location. If both posses are present, a Shootout begins.
5.  **Is the Job Done?:** If the Leader's posse wins the shootout, the Job succeeds and its effects are resolved.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
*   **Victory Check:** At the start of the Sundown phase, if a player has more **Control points** than the highest **Influence** total of any other single player, they win.
*   **Tiebreakers:**
    1.  Most Control points.
    2.  Most Influence points.
    3.  If still tied, play another day.
*   **Control Points:** Gained from controlling Deeds (blue chips). The Controller of a Deed is the player with the most Influence there.
*   **Influence Points:** The sum of the Influence values of all Dudes a player controls.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
*   **Hand Ranks:** Card effects can alter hand rank. A hand is treated as the worst possible hand of its new rank (unless raised to 11) or the best possible hand of its new rank (unless lowered to 1).
*   **Harrowed Dudes:** A Harrowed Dude can cover 1 casualty by being sent home booted, 2 by being discarded, or 3 by being aced. If aced by a card effect, it is discarded instead.
*   **Sidekicks:** A Sidekick card attached to a Dude can be discarded to cover 1 casualty.
*   **Deed Leaving Play:** If a Deed is discarded or aced, all Dudes at that Deed go home booted, and the gap in the street is closed.
*   **React Abilities:** Can be played out of turn in response to specific events, following a "react window" that resolves in turn order.
