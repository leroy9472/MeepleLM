## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   - Players take on hidden roles as either Loyalists (working for the human monarchy) or Restorationists (serving the Old Ones).  
   - The objective is to accumulate Victory Points (VP) through strategic actions, card claims, assassinations, and track manipulation, while concealing your allegiance.  
   - The game ends when a player reaches the VP threshold (based on player count), a track reaches 10, or a Restorationist is forced to reveal. Final scoring adjusts VPs based on secret identity, and the highest score wins.

     - Shuffle each City’s stack, place facedown, and flip the top card face-up.  
   - If a Royalty card is revealed during setup, move it to its Royalty slot and flip the next card.
