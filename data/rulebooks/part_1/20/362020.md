## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Cosmoctopus, the Great Inky One, is a mysterious galactic cephalopod whose presence looms over the Inky Realm. As a devotee, your goal is to prove your devotion by gathering 8 tentacles through exploration, resource management, and strategic use of cards representing relics, scriptures, hallucinations, and constellations. The first player to summon Cosmoctopus by earning 8 tentacles wins.

In co-operative or solo play, the Private Investigator (PI) is introduced as an AI opponent. The players must collectively reach 8 tentacles each before the PI does.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Build the Inky Realm**:  
   - Randomly select 1 special tile and combine with 8 basic tiles. Shuffle all 9 and lay them out in a 3×3 grid (or use an alternative layout).  
2. **Place Components**:  
   - Place Cosmoctopus head on any tile.  
   - Place tentacles nearby.  
   - Shuffle the 88 Devotee Cards to form the Devotee Deck.  
   - Reveal 3 cards from the deck to form the **Card Row**.  
   - Place the 4 **Forbidden Knowledge Tiles** face-up near the board.  
   - Set out resources (ink, coins, whispers, stars), resource multiplier tokens, and generic discount tokens.  
   - Place **First Contact cards** face-up nearby.  
   - Give each player:  
     - 1 Summoning Tile (blank side up)  
     - 1 Reference Card  
     - 5 cards from the Devotee Deck  
     - 2 of each resource (ink, coins, whispers, stars)  
3. **Determine First Player** and distribute **Generic Discount Tokens** based on player order:  
   - 2nd player: 1 token  
   - 3rd player: 2 tokens  
   - 4th player: 3 tokens  
   - (These may be discarded at any time for a 1-resource discount on generic card costs.)

> **Optional Variants**:  
> - Use 3-card curated starting hands (from Reference Cards) for beginners.  
> - Draft starting hands: deal 5, keep 1, pass 4 left, repeat until 5 cards kept.  
> - For faster games, give each player 3 tentacles at start.  

> **With Private Investigator (PI)**:  
> - Add PI components:  
>   - Shuffle 8 PI Behaviour Cards into a deck.  
>   - Place 1 PI Revelation Card and Progress Tracker Card together.  
>   - Place PI tentacle on "0" of tracker.  
>   - Reveal top PI Behaviour Card.  
>   - Place 1 Magnifying Glass Token on each Inky Realm tile matching the icon on the revealed PI card.  
>   - Give PI starting resources based on difficulty (Naïve = 0 recommended).  
> - PI takes last turn.

> **With Cosmic Bridge (Optional Mode)**:  
> - After laying Inky Realm tiles face down, place 2 Cosmic Bridge Tokens on any non-adjacent tiles.  
> - Flip tiles face up.  
> - These two tiles are now considered adjacent for movement.  
> - Players may discard a card to move a bridge token to a new tile (does not count as playing a card).  
> - In disconnected layouts, one bridge token must remain in each section.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, perform these steps in order:

1. **Move Cosmoctopus**  
   - Move to an adjacent tile (no diagonals).  
   - Gain the bonus shown on the destination tile.  
   - You may spend **1 resource of any type** per additional tile moved (Tribute).  
   - Cannot return to the tile you started on.  
   - Only gain bonus from final tile landed on.  

2. **Play a Card (Optional)**  
   - Play **1 card** unless another effect allows more.  
   - Pay total cost: specific resources + generic (♦) cost.  
   - Use Scripture discounts (if applicable):  
     - Specific (e.g., ) discounts apply only to matching costs.  
     - Generic (♦) discounts apply only to generic costs unless card has the Forbidden Scripture icon (R).  
   - **Discount via discarding cards**:  
     - Discard 1 card → reduce total cost by 1 (any type).  
     - May be used for cards or Forbidden Knowledge.  

   **Card Types**:  
   - **Scripture**: Permanent discount. May have **Submerge** effect (discard all & in card row, then move Cosmoctopus once per discarded card).  
   - **Relic**: Ongoing effect (e.g., resource boosts). May allow drawing a card when played (if has icon).  
   - **Hallucination**: One-time effect, then discard. May allow playing a second card this turn (if has ♠ icon).  
   - **Constellation**: Fill 4 slots with resources to complete. Must start at top-left (A). Slots unlock via arrows. When completed: gain 1 tentacle + effect, return resources, discard card.  
     - Cannot place resources gained *before* playing the constellation.

3. **Discard Down to 8**  
   - End turn with **no more than 8 cards in hand** and **no more than 8 of any single resource type**.  
   - Excess must be discarded.  
   - Remember: cards can be discarded earlier for cost discounts.

4. **Rotate Cosmoctopus**  
   - After turn ends, rotate head to face next player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Gaining Tentacles  
Tentacles are gained by:  
- Completing a **Constellation** (always grants 1 tentacle).  
- Playing certain **Hallucinations** or other cards with tentacle symbols (e.g., "Gain ").  
- Acquiring **Forbidden Knowledge** (grants 2 tentacles).  

#### Forbidden Knowledge  
- If you have **13 of a single resource type** at any point on your turn:  
  - Pay 13 of that resource.  
  - Gain **2 tentacles**.  
  - Take the corresponding **Forbidden Knowledge Tile** (blocks others from gaining it).  
- Scripture discounts and card discards can be used to help pay the 13-resource cost.  

#### First Contact  
- First player to gain a tentacle selects 1 of the 4 **First Contact cards** (0 cost, purple icon).  
- Other players gain one when they earn their first tentacle (from remaining pool).  
- These are free to play but count as your one card play per turn.  

#### Card Row Management  
- When a card is taken or discarded from the row, immediately replace it from the Devotee Deck.  
- If deck runs out, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
- Players may look through discard pile at any time.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Each **tentacle** is placed on your Summoning Tile.  
- **First player to gain 8 tentacles wins immediately** (in competitive mode).  
- **With Private Investigator**:  
  - All players must gain 8 tentacles before the PI does.  
  - When a player reaches 8:  
    - Return tentacles to supply.  
    - Flip Summoning Tile to icon side.  
    - Discard all cards and resources.  
    - On future turns, only perform **Move Cosmoctopus**, donating the tile bonus to another active player.  
  - PI wins if it reaches 8 tentacles before all players do.  
  - PI turn order: last.  
  - PI gains resources:  
    - 1 per card in card row (each turn).  
    - May gain tentacles or Forbidden Knowledge based on thresholds:  
      - 13+ of a resource → gain 2 tentacles + Forbidden Knowledge (if available).  
      - 8+ of a resource → gain 1 tentacle (if Forbidden Knowledge already taken).  
    - After gaining tentacles, discard current behaviour card, reveal new one, reposition magnifying tokens.  
    - When PI gains 5th tentacle, flip revelation and tracker cards for new rules.  
    - PI does **not** discard down at end of turn.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move through a tile without gaining its bonus?**  
  No — you only gain the bonus of the **final tile** you land on. Intermediate tiles grant nothing.  

- **Can I use Scripture discounts on Forbidden Knowledge?**  
  Only if the Scripture has the **Forbidden Scripture icon (R)**. Generic (♦) discounts cannot be used unless this icon is present.  

- **Can I fill constellation slots with old resources?**  
  No — you can only place resources gained **after** the constellation was played.  

- **Can I play more than one card per turn?**  
  Only if a card effect (e.g., Hallucination with ♠ icon) explicitly allows it.  

- **What happens if the Devotee Deck runs out?**  
  Shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.  

- **Can I discard cards outside of my turn?**  
  No — except for discarding down at end of turn, or during your own turn to pay costs.  

- **Can I move the Cosmic Bridge token during another player’s turn?**  
  No — only during your own **Move Cosmoctopus** step, and only by discarding a card from your hand.  

- **Can both Cosmic Bridge tokens be in the same section of a disconnected layout?**  
  No — in disconnected layouts, **one token must remain in each section**.  

- **Can I use a generic discount token to pay for a specific resource cost?**  
  No — generic discount tokens reduce **generic (♦) cost only**.  

- **Does the PI take First Contact cards?**  
  No — the PI does not gain First Contact cards.  

- **Can I choose not to gain Forbidden Knowledge when I have 13 resources?**  
  Yes — it is optional. You may save resources for later.
