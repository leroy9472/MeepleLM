### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Auction & Patching
- **Auction Setup (3–4 players):**
  - Draw one Terrain Tile per player.
  - Alternate sides: White, Black, White, etc.
  - In 3-player games, alternate starting color each round.
- **Bidding:**
  - Starts with First Player, proceeds clockwise.
  - Minimum bid: 1 Coin.
  - Players may only bid on one tile at a time.
  - If outbid, player may:
    - Raise bid to beat highest
    - Move bid to another unclaimed tile
    - Move bid and raise to become highest
  - Bidding ends when each tile has exactly one highest bid.
  - All bids go to Public Storage; winners take tiles.
- **No Coin?** If a player has no Coin, they **must forfeit 3 Culture** to gain 1 Coin (once per auction).
- **First Round Auction (3–4 players):**
  - Reveal tiles one at a time.
  - First player may bid or pass.
  - Each subsequent player may bid or pass.
  - Last player **must bid**.
  - Then proceed with normal auction rules.

#### Patching
- After winning a tile, **patch it immediately** or **forfeit it**.
- **Rules:**
  - At least one square must overlap existing territory (1-for-1, 2-for-2, etc.).
  - Text must face you.
  - Workers remain on patched squares if gold box exists.
  - **Cannot** partially cover Heroes, Wonders, or Special Buildings.
  - **Sea Rules:**
    - Can be patched **over** any non-Sea square.
    - Cannot be patched **under** any square.
    - No Sea may be adjacent (orthogonally) to another Sea.
    - No square may be placed above or below a Sea.
- **Maximum Size:**
  - Era I: 5×5
  - Era II: 6×6
  - Era III: 7×7
- Update Reference Board after patching.

#### Diplomacy & Management
- Players get **Political Points (Politics)** = number of active **Book (POL)** icons.
- This phase has two steps:
  1. **Diplomacy** – done in turn order
  2. **Management** – usually simultaneous, but can be turn-ordered if needed

##### Diplomacy Actions
- **Aid (2 Politics):**
  - Offer 3 total units (Food, Coin, Resources) via Trade Route.
  - If accepted: you gain **5 Culture**, recipient cannot give Aid this round.
  - If rejected: you gain **2 Culture**, keep goods.
- **Threaten (3 Politics):**
  - Must be connected by **General Trade Route**.
  - Cannot threaten an **Allied** player.
  - Your **Military > Target’s (Military + Defense)** to succeed.
  - Demand: **2 Culture or 3 Coin** (or **4 Culture or 5 Coin** if Military exceeds by 5+).
  - Target pays what they can.
- **Break Alliance (All Politics):**
  - Must be the **only Diplomacy action** this round.
  - Forfeit one Allied Trade Route.
  - Workers on it return to their owners’ territory.
  - Gain **1 Vote per Political Point spent**.

##### Management Actions
- **Trade (1 Politics):** Pay [2/3/4] Food (by Era) to move a worker to **Start** of Trade Route.
- **Exchange (1 Politics):** Convert Goods:  
  1 Resource = 2 Food = 2 Coin  
  1 Food = 1 Coin  
  Number of conversions = your **Transport** value.
- **Birth (2 Politics):** Pay [4/5/6] Food to bring a worker from Descendant Track to any space.
- **Honor Heroes (2 Politics):** Pay [1/2/3] Food to gain **1 Culture per Hero**.
- **Honor Wonders (2 Politics):** Pay [0/1/2] Resources to gain **1 Culture per Wonder**.
- **Construct Trade Route (2 Politics):** Pay 2 Resources to place a **General Trade Route** to any player (Start faces you). Only one per round.
- **Reclamation (2 Politics):** Pay 1 Resource to cover any 1×1 space (even Sea) with a **Wasteland** tile. Draw new Building Tile.
- **Construct Building (3 Politics):** Pay 2 or 3 Resources (by building type) to place a Building tile on any 1×1 non-Sea space. Draw new Building Tile.
- **Campaign (* Politics):** Spend any number of Political Points to gain **equal Votes**.

#### Movement
- Each worker moves up to **Transport** value.
- **Within Territory:**
  - Orthogonal movement only.
  - Can end on Sea.
  - Can pass through other workers.
  - Only one worker per space at end.
- **On Trade Routes:**
  - Must move at least 1 space forward.
  - **General Trade Route:**

    - Can move to **Rest/Return** to return next round.
    - If Transport = 0, move all workers to Rest.
  - **Allied Trade Route:**
    - Worker returns to territory upon reaching opponent’s **Start/Return**.

#### Negotiation & War
- Triggered if workers are on **Return/Preparation** or **War/Return** spaces.

##### Negotiation
- Worker on **Return/Preparation** triggers negotiation.
- Players take **Patton** and **Genghis Khan** tokens.
- Secretly choose **Red (Aggression)** or **Blue (Defender/Alliance)**.
- **Both Blue:**
  - May form **Alliance** (both must agree).
  - Place Allied Trade Route (direction chosen by worker’s controller).
  - Workers return to territory.
- **One or Both Red:**
  - **War declared** (next round).
  - Red players = **Aggressors**, pay **[0/1/2] Resources** (War Preparation).
  - Blue player = **Defender**, gains defensive bonus in war.

##### Resolving War
- Aggressor(s) vs. Defender.
- **Step 1:** Announce base strength:
  - Aggressor: **Military Strength**
  - Defender: **Military + Defense (Shields)**
- **Step 2:** Secretly spend Resources to boost strength (1 Resource = +1 Strength).
- **Step 3:** Highest total wins. **Defender wins ties.** If both aggressors tie, both lose.
- **Rewards:**
  - Winning Aggressor: **[5/10/15] Culture** (from supply)
  - Winning Defender: **[3/6/9] Culture** (from supply)
  - Winner by 5+ strength: gain **7 Culture from loser**
- Worker returns to territory.

#### Production & Worker Maintenance

  - Workers on Trade Routes generate additional Goods.
  - Gold-box bonuses only if worker is present.
- **Worker Maintenance:**
  - Pay Food = highest uncovered number on Descendant Track.
  - If short: pay all Food, then **3 Culture per Food short**.

#### Heroes & Wonders Maintenance (End of Era)
- Pay **2 Food per Hero**, **1 Resource per Wonder**.
- If short:
  - **3 Culture per Food short**
  - **6 Culture per Resource short**

#### Voting (End of Era)
1. Each player chooses 1 Prosperity Card and places it face-down.
2. Shuffle and reveal all.
3. For each card, players secretly assign Votes.
4. Reveal and place Votes on cards.
5. **Discard card(s) with fewest Votes** (all tied lowest are discarded in 3–4p).
6. Score remaining cards:
   - **2p:** High card: 1 Culture/vote to winner; Low card: ½ votes (down) to winner.
   - **3p:** 1st: 1 Culture/vote; 2nd: ½ votes (down); 3rd: 0.
   - **4p:** 1st: 1 Culture/vote; 2nd: ½ votes (down); 3rd: 0; 4th: lose ½ votes (down).
   - Ties: all tied players drop in rank (e.g., two 2nd = both 3rd).
