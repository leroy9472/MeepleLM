## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Walnut Grove is a strategic worker placement and resource management game set in a rural 19th-century farming community. Players expand their farms, grow crops, hire workers, and manage seasonal demands over eight years (rounds). The goal is to earn the most victory points (VPs) through efficient farm development, worker management, and prudent use of resources.

### 2. Components  
- Game board depicting the town with buildings and pathways  
- Player boards representing individual farms  
- Landscape tiles (used to expand farms)  
- Worker figures (farmers and laborers)  
- Hut and barn structures  
- Goods cubes (representing food types: grain, vegetables, etc.)  
- Resource coins (gold, silver, copper — used as currency and for end-game scoring)  
- Year disc (tracks current season and game round)  
- Improvement (bonus) tiles  
- Neighborly Help tiles (debt tokens)  
- Scoring aid and scoresheets  

### 3. Setup  
- Choose a starting player (youngest player).  
- Each player selects either the Church or Town Hall starting area.  
  - Place pawns in empty starting spaces clockwise from the road.  
  - Spaces must be filled in order from closest to the road.  
- Shuffle landscape tiles and place them within reach.  
- Place improvement tiles, worker tiles, and building tiles on designated areas of the board (not refreshed during the game).  
- Set the year disc to Year 1, Spring.  
- Each player receives starting hut(s), barn(s), and initial worker(s) as per standard setup.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds over 8 rounds (years), each consisting of four seasons:

#### 1. Spring – Farm Expansion  
a. **Draw Tiles**: Draw a number of landscape tiles equal to the number shown in the violet section (left) of the year disc (2, 3, or 4).  
b. **Choose Tiles**: Select 1 or 2 tiles (as indicated on the right side of the violet section) and add them adjacent to your farm or existing tiles.  
c. **Discard Tiles**: Return unselected tiles to the bag.  

> Note: Landscapes are one per side; no wrapping across edges.

#### 2. Summer – Work and Harvest  
a. **Place Figures**: Each player places their farmer and laborers onto land areas (contiguous same-type landscapes).  
   - One figure per land area.  
   - Multiple figures allowed if on different land areas (even of same type).  
   - Figures may be placed on personal board landscapes.  
b. **Produce Goods**:  
   - Gain 1 good cube per tile in each occupied land area.  
   - Bonus: +1 good per land area matching the type shown on the summer section of the year disc.  
   - Place goods in empty spaces on the land area or in barns.  
   - Overflow goods are lost.  
   - Goods may be moved from fields to barns, but **not** from barns to fields or between fields.

#### 3. Fall – Business in Town  
a. **Turn Order**:  
   - In Year 1: Church starters go first (front to back), then Town Hall starters.  
   - From Year 2 onward: Start at Town Hall and move counter-clockwise to determine first player; continue for 2nd, 3rd, 4th.  
b. **Movement & Actions**:  
   - On your turn, move your pawn **once** clockwise around the town path to an open building.  
   - You **must** pay the entry fee (1 coin) to use a building.  
   - If you cannot pay, you **cannot stop** there.  
   - You may **pass** (stay in place, do nothing), blocking the current space.  
   - Passing does not grant an action.  
c. **Building Use**:  
   - Use the action of the building you stop on **once**.  
   - No activation cost buildings (e.g., General Store) can be visited without selling.  
   - You may visit the General Store to block, even with nothing to sell.  
d. **Special Buildings (Svenson’s, Soebuck’s)**:  
   - These have double spots but count as **one space**.  
   - You must take the furthest spot if entering.  
   - To use the second spot, you must move all the way around the board.  
   - Two pawns can occupy the same building space simultaneously.  
e. **Entry Fees & Neighborly Help**:  
   - Pay 1 coin (any value) when passing Town Hall or Church Bazaar.  
   - Failure to pay: Take a **Neighborly Help tile** (face-up) for each missing coin.  
   - Cannot use Neighborly Help to pay entry fees.  
   - Cannot stop on Taxation space.

#### 4. Winter – Upkeep  
a. **Feed Workers**:  
   - Each worker requires 1 matching food cube (color).  
   - Black workers require no food.  
   - Some workers (indicated on winter section of year disc) are hungrier: require **2 goods**.  
   - For each missing food: take **1 Neighborly Help tile**.  
b. **Heat Workers**:  
   - Each worker on a campsite requires 1 wood (brown good).  
   - Additionally, pay 1 brown good per fire symbol shown on winter section of year disc.  
   - For each missing wood: take **1 Neighborly Help tile**.

> Note: You **cannot** pay off Neighborly Help tiles **during** harvest or feeding/heating. Settlement must occur before or after.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Coins  
- All coins (gold, silver, copper) can be used as **wild resources** when:  
  - Paying building entry fees  
  - Covering food or wood shortages in Winter  
- Printed coin value only matters for **end-game scoring**.  
- Coins cannot be sold for other coins at General Store.  
- Coins may be discarded from barns at any time.

#### Goods  
- Unlimited supply — use substitutes if needed.  
- Movement: Fields → Barns only.  
- May discard goods or coins from barns at any time.

#### Neighborly Help  
- Can be taken **only** when:  
  - Need food or wood during Winter upkeep  
  - Need coins for taxes or entry fees in Fall  
- Cannot be used to pay:  
  - Entry fees  
  - Trading  
  - Paying another Neighborly Help tile  
- Repayment: At any time, pay **3 goods** (any combination) to remove **one** Neighborly Help tile.  
  - Cannot use coins.  
  - Only one tile may be removed at a time.  
- If you already have a Neighborly Help tile and take another:  
  - Flip the existing tile face-down. It can no longer be repaid.  
- You may take and repay a tile **immediately** (e.g., to free space).

#### Improvement (Bonus) Tiles  
- Limited supply — not refreshed during the game.  
- Each player may buy **up to 3** improvement tiles.  
- Cannot discard purchased tiles.  
- May purchase multiple copies of the same tile.

#### End of Year  
- New laborers enter the game.  
- Advance or replace the year disc to next year.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move past a building I can’t afford?**  
  Yes, but you **cannot stop** there. You must either move to an affordable building or pass.

  Yes, if they are in **different land areas** (e.g., one on grain, one on pasture).
