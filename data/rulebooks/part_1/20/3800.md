# Himalaya — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
As the Chief of a Himalayan high plateau tribe (Dolpo-pa, Bhotia, Sherpa, or Tamang), you lead a yack caravan across snowy mountain paths to collect goods (salt, barley, tea, jade, gold) and increase your tribe’s political, religious, and economic influence. The goal is to become the most prosperous caravaneer by fulfilling orders, placing stupas, sending delegations, and accumulating yacks (livestock). Victory is determined by influence dominance at the end of 12 turns.

### 2. Components
- 1 game board depicting 20 villages, 8 regions, and three path types (dirt, ice, stone)
- 4 player screens (one per color)
- 4 caravaneer miniatures (one per color)
- 20 stupa figures (4 per color, 5 total colors not specified—assume 4 colors used)
- 60 delegation figures (15 per color)
- 60 wooden "goods" blocks in 5 colors:
  - White: Salt
  - Orange: Barley
  - Black: Tea
  - Green: Jade
  - Yellow: Gold
- 15 inventory markers (number not per player; assumed shared)
- 40 order markers (round, with goods symbols and yack value)
- 24 action markers (6 per player)
- 12 event markers:
  - 4 Yeti footprints
  - 4 Snowstorm
  - 4 Market Day
- 1 turn marker (wooden block)
- 1 twenty-sided die
- 2 cloth bags (for goods and orders)

### 3. Setup
1. Place the board in the center.
2. Place the turn marker on space "1" of the turn track (12 spaces total).
3. Place all goods in one cloth bag; shuffle.
4. Place all order markers in the second cloth bag; shuffle.
5. Each player chooses a tribe (color) and takes:
   - 1 screen
   - 1 caravaneer
   - 5 stupas
   - 15 delegations
   - 6 action markers
6. **Place goods**:
   - Roll the d20 four more times (total 5 rolls).
   - Each roll determines a village to receive 5 randomly drawn goods.
   - If a village is already filled, place goods on the next empty village (numerical order, looping from 20→1).
7. **Place orders**:
   - Roll the d20 five times.
   - Each roll determines a village to receive 1 random order.
   - If the village has goods or an order, place the order on the next empty village (same as above).
   - Result: 5 villages with goods, 5 with orders.
8. **Determine starting player**:
   - The "wisest player" begins and takes the d20 as the first caravaneer marker.
9. **Place caravans**:
   - Starting with the first caravaneer, each player places their caravaneer on any village (with or without goods/orders).
   - No two players may start in the same village.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 12 turns. Each turn has 5 phases:

#### Phase 1: Turn Marker Progress
- Move the turn marker one space right on the calendar.
- The player who went first last turn now goes last.
- The player to their left becomes the new first caravaneer.

#### Phase 1 (Advanced Rules Only): Placing Event Counters
- Starting with the first caravaneer, each player may place **one** of their event markers:
  - Yeti footprints
  - Snowstorm
  - Market Day
- Only one of each event type may be on the board per turn.
- Events are removed at the end of the turn and can be used only once per game.

#### Phase 2: Secret Action Programming
- Each player secretly arranges their 6 action markers behind their screen, left to right.
- Actions:
  - **Front side** (symbol):
    - Dirt / Ice / Stone track: move along that path type
    - Hands: deal (collect goods or fulfill order)
  - **Back side** (sleeping yack): rest (no move, no deal)
- Players have ~1–2 minutes to program.
- Reveal all action rows simultaneously when time ends.

#### Phase 3: Resolve Actions
- Players resolve actions in order (1st action of all players, then 2nd, etc.), starting with the first caravaneer and proceeding clockwise.
- **Movement**:
  - Must follow programmed path type.
  - Invalid move (e.g., no such path) is ignored.
- **Deals**:
  - **Collect goods**: Only one good per village per turn. Must take the **lowest-value** good available.
  - **Fulfill order**: Must possess all required goods. Deliver them; they return to the bag.
    - If impossible (e.g., village empty), action is canceled.
- Upon fulfilling an order, player may choose **2 of 3**:
  1. **Barter**: Keep the order marker (face up behind screen). Value = number of yacks gained (economic influence).
  2. **Offerings**: Place one stupa on the current village. Only one stupa per village (any color). Increases religious influence.
  3. **Send delegations**:
     - Level 1 village (House): 1 delegation
     - Level 2 (Temple): 2 delegations
     - Level 3 (Monastery): 3 delegations
     - Delegations placed in adjacent regions only.

#### Phase 4: Add Goods and Orders
- If any village was emptied of goods or orders, refill:
  - **First, refill goods**:
    - Roll d20; place 5 random goods in the indicated village.
    - If occupied, use next empty village.
    - Repeat until 5 villages have goods.
  - **Then, refill orders**:
    - Roll d20; place 1 random order.
    - If occupied, use next empty village.
    - Repeat until 5 villages have orders.
- Always maintain 5 goods villages and 5 order villages.

#### Phase 5: Inventory (Turns 4, 8, 12 only)
- All players reveal their stock of each good **in order of value**:
  1. Salt
  2. Barley
  3. Tea
  4. Jade
  5. Gold
- For each good:
  - Player with **most** of that good wins:
    - **Basic Rules**: 1 inventory marker (worth 3 yacks)
    - **Advanced Rules**: Choose one:
      - Take inventory marker (3 yacks)
      - Send 2 delegations to adjacent region
      - Place a stupa on a level 1 village in adjacent region
  - If tied, **no one wins** the reward.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Caravan Movement**: Determined by programmed action markers.
- **Action Resolution Order**: Sequential per action slot, starting with first caravaneer.
- **Goods Collection**: Must take lowest-value good per village per turn.
- **Order Fulfillment**: Grants 2 of 3 rewards (barter, stupa, delegations).
- **Event Markers (Advanced)**:
  - **Yeti footprints**: Block a track (no movement allowed).
  - **Snowstorm**: Requires two consecutive "move" actions to traverse (first to enter storm, second to exit).
    - Cannot end turn on snowstorm.
  - **Market Day**: In a goods village, player may take **any** good (not just lowest value).
- **Turn Rotation**: First player shifts clockwise each turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after turn 12. Score three types of influence:

#### Religious Influence
- Stupa in Level 1 (House): 1 point
- Stupa in Level 2 (Temple): 2 points
- Stupa in Level 3 (Monastery): 3 points
- Total all stupas.

#### Political Influence
- For each of the 8 regions:
  - Player with **majority** of delegations gains 1 point.
  - If tied, **no one** scores.

#### Economic Influence
- Total number of yacks:
  - From barter (order markers kept)
  - From inventory markers (each = 3 yacks)

#### Winning Conditions
- **3 Players**:
  - Winner has **majority in at least 2** of 3 influence types.
  - Tiebreakers:
    1. Higher economic influence
    2. Then political
    3. Then religious
- **4 Players**:
  - **Elimination process**:
    1. Eliminate player with **lowest religious influence**.
       - Tie: Fewest stupas → Fewest yacks
    2. Eliminate player with **lowest political influence**.
       - Tie: Fewest delegations → Fewest yacks
    3. Between remaining two, **higher economic influence** wins.
       - Tie: Higher political → Higher religious

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I move through a blocked track (Yeti/Snowstorm)?**
  - Yeti: No.
  - Snowstorm: Only with two consecutive move actions.

  - No. Kept secret behind screen until scoring.
