## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective
In Age of Renaissance, players lead one of six great commercial houses (Venice, Genoa, London, Barcelona, Hamburg, Paris) through three historical epochs (750–1750 AD). The goal is to become the most advanced and wealthiest power by acquiring Civilization Advances, controlling markets, managing resources, and avoiding chaos. Victory is determined by summing the value of all Advances, cash on hand, and subtracting Misery.

3. Setup
- Select game length: Basic (Epoch 1 only), Intermediate (Epochs 1–2), or Campaign (all 3).

- Return removed 5 cards:
  - 3–4 players: After 1st turn draw

- Players secretly bid cash for capital selection (Venice, Genoa, etc.). Highest bidder chooses first.
- Place 1 ● marker on each capital.
- Starting cash: $40 minus capital bid.
- Place Misery markers at 0.
- Determine initial turn order: least tokens bought for expansion goes first; tiebreaker: later capital choice.

- Game ends after any turn where:
  - A player acquires all 26 Advances, or
  - Final card is drawn from the last epoch (per game length)
- Final Card Play: All unplayed cards are played in turn order. No new cards drawn.
- Final Score = (Total Advance Value) + (Cash on Hand) – (Misery Value)
- Highest score wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- Misery below 0 not allowed; Chaos at >1000 eliminates player.
- Patronage: Only non-first Leader cards are claimable; protection $ paid to owner.
- Fractions always round up.
- Diplomacy: Must be open; no card showing; bribes forbidden. Violators: +1 Misery, forfeit ½ written cash.
- War Card:
  - Tied rolls: both gain 1 Misery, reroll next player’s turn
  - Max rounds = remaining player turns in phase
  - If still tied at turn end, game ends with no winner
- Civil War: Victim loses ½ cash or ½ tokens, gains 1 Misery, becomes last in turn order.
- Voided Events (e.g., by Laws of Matter): remain in hand as "Misery Burdens," count toward hand size.
- Final Turn: No Order of Play phase; Final Card Play uses last turn’s order.
