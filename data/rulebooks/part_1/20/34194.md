# Aquaretto – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Each player owns a water zoo and aims to attract the most visitors by collecting and organizing animal tiles. Points are earned for animals in the water zoo, bonuses from coworkers, and efficient management of space and resources. Players must balance expansion, animal placement, and depot usage to maximize points while minimizing penalties. The player with the highest score at game end wins.

### 2. Components  
- 88 animal tiles (8 types, 11 per type: 2 fertile males, 2 fertile females, 7 standard)  
- 16 offspring tiles (1 per animal type, 2 per included game)  
- 10 coin tiles  
- 30 coins  
- 16 coworkers (meeples)  
- 5 water zoo boards (19 spaces each)  
- 10 small expansion boards (L-shaped, 3 spaces)  
- 10 large expansion boards (square, 4 spaces)  
- 5 depot boards  
- 5 delivery trucks

Note: Each animal tile may have symbols for fertility (♂/♀), fish, or lightning bolt (untrainable).

### 3. Setup  
**Player Count Adjustments:**  
- 5 players: Use all animal and offspring tiles.  
- 4 players: Remove all tiles of one animal type (except dolphins, orcas, sea lions).  
- 3 players: Remove all tiles of two animal types (except dolphins, orcas, sea lions).  
- 2 players: Remove all tiles of three animal types; use special 2-player rules (see below).

**General Setup:**  
1. Place offspring tiles in the center, face up.  
2. Shuffle remaining tiles (animal and coin) face down.  
3. Set aside 15 tiles face down; place wooden disc on top (reserve stack).  
4. Form one or more face-down draw stacks with remaining tiles.  
5. Place delivery trucks in center: one per player (3 for 2 players).  
6. Each player takes:  
   - 1 water zoo board  
   - 1 depot board  
   - 2 small expansion boards  
   - 2 large expansion boards  
   - 1 coin  
7. Place coins and coworkers in supply (bank).  
8. Choose starting player.

**2-Player Variant Setup Only:**  
- Use 3 delivery trucks.  
- Use 3 removed tiles (face down) to block spaces:  
  - 1 tile blocks 1 space on Truck 1  
  - 2 tiles block 2 spaces on Truck 2  
- Blocked spaces are unusable for entire game.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds. On a player’s turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

#### A. Add a Tile to a Delivery Truck  
- Draw the top tile from any face-down stack (reserve only when others are empty).  
- Place it face up on **any empty space** of **any unclaimed** delivery truck.  
- A truck holds **max 3 tiles**.  
- Cannot perform if all trucks have 3 tiles.

#### B. Take a Delivery Truck (Ends Round for Player)  
- Take **any unclaimed** truck with **at least one face-up tile**.  
- Place tiles from the truck into your play area.  
- Immediately place animal tiles into your water zoo or depot; coin tiles go to your coin supply.  
- You **cannot act further** this round.  
- After all players take a truck, the round ends.

#### C. Carry Out a Money Action (Pay Required Cost)  
Pay coins to perform one of the following:

| Action | Cost | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Move** | 1 coin | Move top tile from depot to water zoo **or** move a coworker to a new valid location. |
| **Purchase or Discard** | 2 coins | - **Purchase**: Take top tile from opponent’s depot, place in your water zoo. Pay 1 coin to opponent, 1 to bank.<br>- **Discard**: Remove top tile from your depot. Return to box. Pay 2 coins to bank. |
| **Expand Water Zoo** | 1 coin (small)<br>2 coins (large) | - **Small expansion (3 spaces)**: Attach adjacent to zoo; does **not** increase basin limit.<br>- **Large expansion (4 spaces)**: Attach adjacent; increases max basins by 1. |

**Rules for Expansion Placement:**  
- Must align with at least one row or column of existing zoo (original or expansion).  
- May not overlap or float.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Animal Placement Rules  
- **Basin**: Group of orthogonally adjacent tiles of the **same animal type**.  
- **Basin Limits**:  
  - Base zoo: max **3 basins** (3 animal types).  
  - Each **large expansion** adds +1 basin limit (max 5 total).  
- **Starting a Basin**:  
  - Only if no tile of that type in zoo.  
  - Place tile on empty space **not orthogonally adjacent** to any other basin.  
  - Diagonal adjacency is allowed.  
- **Enlarging a Basin**:  
  - Must place new tile **orthogonally adjacent** to same-type basin.  
  - New tile must remain **at least one space away** (non-adjacent) from other basins.  

#### Depot Rules  
- Used when:  
  - No space in zoo  
  - Player chooses not to place in zoo  
  - Cannot legally place in zoo (e.g., violates adjacency)  
- Tiles are stacked **face up**, **top = newest**.  
- **Order cannot be changed**.  
- All players may inspect depots at any time.  
- Any number of animal types allowed in depot.

#### Offspring Mechanism  
- Each animal type has 2 fertile males (♂) and 2 fertile females (♀).  
- When **one male and one female** of same type are in the **same basin**, produce **1 offspring tile**.  
- Place offspring tile in the same basin if space allows; otherwise, place in depot.  
- Offspring counts as normal tile of that type.  
- Each fertile tile can only produce **once**.  
- A second offspring is produced only when **both pairs** (2♂ + 2♀) are in the same basin.  
- Offspring only produced in **basins**, not in depots or trucks.

#### Bonus Triggers (When Enlarging Basin)  
| Tile Count Added To Basin | Reward |
|---------------------------|--------|
| 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th | +1 coin (from bank) |
| 5th, 10th | +1 coworker (immediately assign to role) |

- Bonuses apply even if multiple thresholds are crossed in one action (e.g., adding 3 tiles to go from 2→5 earns coin and coworker).

#### Coworker Roles  
Each coworker must be assigned immediately upon earning. Only one action per turn.

| Role | Max | Placement | Scoring |
|------|-----|-----------|--------|
| **Cashier** | 2 | Lower left of zoo (checkout booth) | +1 pt per coin at game end (×2 with 2 cashiers) |
| **Keeper** | 2 | Lower left of zoo (feeding station) | +1 pt per tile with **fish symbol** (×2 with 2 keepers). Fish symbols on: Hippo, Penguin, Turtle, Crocodile, Polar Bear (6 per type) |
| **Trainer** | Unlimited | Any empty space in zoo | +1 pt per **Dolphin, Orca, Sea Lion** tile **orthogonally or diagonally adjacent**. **No points** for tiles with **lightning bolt**. If tile adjacent to multiple trainers, score 1 pt per trainer. |
| **Manager** | 1 | On depot board | At game end, **halves** penalty from depot animal types (from −2 to −1 per type) |

**Coworker Movement (via Move Action):**  
- Can reassign coworker to **same or different role** (e.g., move manager to become trainer).  
- Must follow placement rules for new role.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Trigger:**  
- When a player draws the **first tile from the reserve stack** (with wooden disc), finish the current round.  
- After all players take a delivery truck, **game ends**.

**Final Scoring:**  
1. **Water Zoo Tiles**: +1 point per animal tile.  
2. **Coworker Bonuses**: Apply all scoring as defined.  
3. **Depot Penalty**: −2 points per **different animal type** in depot.  
   - With **Manager**: −1 per type.  
4. **Tiebreaker**:  
   - Most points wins.  
   - Tie: Player with **most coins** wins.  
   - Still tied: Shared victory.
