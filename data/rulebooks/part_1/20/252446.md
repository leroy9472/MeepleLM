## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In Key Flow, players build and develop villages along the River Key over four seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—with the goal of achieving the highest score. The game ends after winter, and the player with the most points wins. Points are earned through upgrading buildings, managing resources, collecting keyple cards, and fulfilling scoring conditions on winter and autumn cards.

### 2. Components

    - 60 winter (white)
- **Resource Counters (180 total)**:

### 3. Setup
1. **Prepare General Supply**:
   - Place all resources, keyple tokens, upgrade tiles, and double-sided skill tiles within reach.
   - Shuffle single-sided skill tiles face down into a draw pile.

2. **Sort Season Cards**:
   - Separate cards by season and by type: K cards (neutral) and numbered cards (player count specific).
   - For spring, summer, and autumn:
     - Return unused K cards to the box:
       - 2–3 players: 6 cards
       - 4 players: 4 cards
       - 5 players: 2 cards
       - 6 players: 0 cards
     - Remove numbered cards for player counts higher than current (e.g., in 4-player game, remove 5+ and 6+ cards).
     - Shuffle remaining K and numbered cards together to form spring, summer, and autumn decks.
   - For winter:
     - Shuffle K winter cards into a separate deck.
     - Place numbered winter cards into another deck.

3. **Deal Player Cards**:
   - Each player receives:
     - 1 random home card (placed face up)
     - 1 store card (placed to the side)
     - Spring cards:
       - 6 in 3–6 player games
       - 8 in 2-player game
     - Winter K cards:
       - 5 in 3–6 player games
       - 7 in 2-player game
   - Unused home, store, and excess winter K cards are returned to the box.
   - Players may look at their winter K cards at any time.

4. **Final Setup**:
   - Place season decks (spring already dealt), winter K deck, and numbered winter deck within reach.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds over four seasons. Each season follows these phases:

#### Phase 1: Deal Cards
- **Spring**: Cards were dealt during setup.
- **Summer, Autumn, Winter**: Deal all cards from the season’s deck equally:
  - 3–6 players: 7 (summer), 8 (autumn), 9 (winter)
  - 2 players: 9 (summer), 10 (autumn), 12 (winter)

#### Phase 2: Draft and Play Cards
- Players simultaneously choose one card from hand to keep and play.
- Remaining cards are passed:
  - Spring and autumn: to the left
  - Summer and winter: to the right
- All players reveal and play their chosen card simultaneously.
- Repeat until all cards are played.

**Village Cards**:
- Cards with a road are placed in the top row.
- Cards with a river are placed in the bottom row, offset by half a card width.
- New cards must connect to at least one existing card (gaps allowed).
- If the card has a round-ended panel at the bottom, gain the shown resources or skill tiles immediately:
  - Random skill tile: draw face down from pile
  - Specific skill tile: take matching double-sided tile

**Keyple Cards**:
- Played above a top-row village card to activate its topmost action.
- Arrows indicate playable locations:
  - Down: own village
  - Left/Right: adjacent neighbor’s village
  - In 2-player game: left/right arrows allow placement on opponent’s home or cards to one side
- Number of keyples determines placement:
  - 1 keyple: only on empty buildings
  - 2 keyples: on buildings with ≤1 keyple card
  - 3 keyples: on buildings with ≤2 keyple cards
- Keyple tokens can be spent to increase keyple count to a maximum of 3.
- Simultaneous play rules:
  - Actions resolve based on game state before any cards are played.
  - Cannot use a building placed this turn.
  - Cannot benefit from upgrades placed this turn.
  - More than 3 keyple cards may end up on a building due to simultaneous play.

**Discarding**:
- A player may discard any card (village or keyple) to gain 1 keyple token.
- Discarded card is returned unseen to the box.

#### Phase 3: Use Keyple Tokens
- After all cards are played, players may use keyple tokens for additional actions in their own village:
  - 1 token: activate a building with 0 or 1 prior activations
  - 2 tokens: activate a building with 2 prior activations
  - Cannot activate a building 3 or more times
- Each token used counts as a keyple card for activation limits.

#### Phase 4: Remove Keyple Cards and Tokens
- All used keyple tokens are returned to supply.
- All keyple cards played in a player’s village are placed face down under their store card.
- Players may look at cards under their store card after this phase.

#### Phase 5: End of Autumn – Winter Preparation
- All players choose one of their winter K cards.
- Simultaneously reveal and play the chosen card into their village.
- Shuffle remaining winter K cards with numbered winter cards to form the winter deck.

#### Phase 6: Final Scoring (End of Winter)
After winter, scoring is performed as follows:

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Transport and Upgrade Actions
- Cards with cart icons allow transport; number indicates movement points.
  - Each point moves 1 resource 1 space (road or river).
  - Can be split across resources.
- Cards with upgrade icons (Φ) allow upgrading buildings:
  - Choose a building with multiple panels.
  - Pay cost shown on upgrade arrow (resources must be on the card; skill tiles from player supply).
  - Cover top panel with upgrade tile (black house side up).
  - Alternatively, flip any existing upgrade tile to point side (1 point) at no cost.
- Only available in player’s own village.

#### Resource and Skill Tile Generation
- Cards like Gold Mine, Workshop, Alehouse generate resources or tiles.
- Resources from own village: placed on generating card.
- Resources from neighbor’s village: placed on player’s home card.
- Skill tiles kept in front of player; single-sided may be face down.

#### Skill Tile Conversion
- Cards like Brewer, Carpenter, Hiring Fair convert skill tiles into resources.
- Requires activation via keyple card.
- Skill tile is returned to supply (double-sided kept separate).

#### Boat Cards (Summer)
- Placed in bottom row; not activated by keyple cards.
- Provide unique ongoing abilities:
  - **Brainwave**: Play 1-keyple or 2-keyple cards to any adjacent village.
  - **Flipper**: Gain 1 gold when flipping an upgrade tile.
  - **Keyflower**: Use any resource as a substitute when upgrading.
  - **Keymelequin**: Score green keyples as yellow or vice versa.
  - **Mansfield Ark**: Score pigs as sheep or vice versa.

#### Winter Cards
- Played at end of autumn; not activated by keyple cards.
- Score points via allocation of components:
  - Each item (card, resource, token) can only be allocated to one scoring card.
  - Gold can substitute for iron, stone, or wood.
  - Unused gold: 1 point each.
- Keyple cards with animals can only score for keyples or animals, not both.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Final scoring includes:

1. **Panels and Upgrades**:
   - Score points shown on highest uncovered panel of each village card.
   - Example: Keythedral scores 5 (unupgraded), 12 (1 upgrade), 20 (2 upgrades).

2. **Double-Upgrades**:
   - Each upgrade tile flipped to point side scores 1 point.

3. **Autumn Location Cards** (Barn, Blacksmith, Stone Yard, Timber Yard):
