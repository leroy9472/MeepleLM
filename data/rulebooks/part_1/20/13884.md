## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Each player represents a young magic student at the University of Zavandor competing to become the next archmage by claiming the legendary Scepter of Zavandor. The game ends when five of the nine Sentinels guarding the Scepter have been acquired. The player with the most Victory Points (VPs) at that point wins the game and claims the Scepter.

### 2. Components
- 1 game board (includes VP track, Knowledge tracks)
- 6 player boards (one per character)
- 56 magic dust chits (value 2)
- 24 magic dust chits (value 5)
- 20 magic dust chits (value 10)
- 28 opals
- 28 sapphires
- 24 emeralds
- 24 diamonds

### 3. Setup
1. **Assign Player Boards**: Shuffle the 6 character boards and randomly distribute one to each player.
2. **Distribute Starting Resources**:
   - Each player receives:
     - 2 opals and 1 sapphire → placed on active gem spiral
     - Starting magic dust: Witch/Elf: 10, Druid: 20, Fairy: 10, Mage: 15, Kobold: 20
     - Fairy receives 2 sapphire energy cards (from Knowledge of the 9 Sages)
3. **Place Wooden Chips**:
   - 1 chip on VP track at 3 VP (from starting gems)
   - 1 chip on starting level of character’s initial Knowledge field
   - 1 chip on hand limit track: Witch/Elf: 4, Druid/Fairy: 5, Mage/Kobold: 6
   - 5 chips on Knowledge Marker spots (20, 25, 30, 35, 40) on player board
   - 1 unused chip kept as reserve
4. **Artifact Preparation**:
   - Number of artifacts in play depends on player count:
     - 2 players: 1 of each type
     - 3–4 players: 2 of each type
     - 5–6 players: 3 of each type
   - Sort artifacts by back letter (A, B, C, D), shuffle each stack, then stack D–C–B–A (A on top)
   - Reveal as many artifact cards as there are players
5. **Prepare Other Supplies**:
   - Sort and shuffle energy cards by type
   - Place magic dust, concentrated energy cards, and 9 Sentinel cards near the board
   - Place turn-order markers nearby

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game turn has 4 phases:

**Phase 1: Determine Turn Order & Refill Artifacts**
- Assign turn order by VP (highest = I, second = II, etc.)
- Tiebreakers: more gem VPs → random
- Refill artifact display to match player count

**Phase 2: Gain Magical Energy**
In turn order, each player gains energy from:
- **Opals (active)**: 1 opal = 2 dust, 2 = 5 dust, 3 = 10 dust, 4+ = 10 + (n–3) dust
- **Sapphires**: 1 card per active gem (blue, 3–7)
- **Emeralds**: 1 card per active gem (green, 5–10) — requires Spellbook
- **Diamonds**: 1 card per active gem (white, 8–12) — requires Elixir
- **Rubies**: 1 card per active gem (red, 13–17) — requires Knowledge of Fire Level 4 (Druid can enchant 1 ruby at Level 3)
- **4+ same-color cards?** → receive 1 concentrated energy card + 2 dust instead

**Phase 3: Take Actions (in turn order, active player chooses sequence)**
- **Enchant/Disenchant Gems**
  - Pay energy to acquire gems from supply
  - Costs reduced by Knowledge of Gems level
  - Max 5 rubies per player
  - Place on spiral (active) or pentagon (inactive)
  - Move gems freely between spiral and pentagon
  - Disenchant: return gem → gain half current cost (rounded down) in dust
- **Improve Knowledge (once per turn)**
  - Pay printed cost to advance one level in one field
  - Must have available knowledge chip (from board or pentagon)
  - First level in new field requires paying for chip (20–40)
  - Level 4 in any field = 2 VPs
  - Some fields change hand limit (only upon first entry)
- **Bid for Artifacts or Sentinels**
  - Active player starts auction on one face-up artifact or available Sentinel
  - Bidding proceeds in turn order; players may pass (flip marker)
  - Starting bid ≥ minimum on card
  - Winner pays full amount (including turn-order adjustments and discounts)
  - Immediate effects apply before next auction
  - Overbid (can’t pay even after disenchanting all gems) → Curse of the 9 Sages → eliminated
  - Active player may start multiple auctions
  - Exceptions: only 1 Magic Belt and 1 Magic Wand per player

**Phase 4: Reset**
- **Observe Hand Limit**
  - Count cards and dust:
    - Standard energy card: 1
    - Dust: 2 = 1, 5 = 2, 10 = 3
    - Concentrated energy card: 3
  - Discard excess; may consolidate dust
- **Count Victory Points**
  - Active gems: opal/sapphire = 1, emerald/diamond = 2, ruby = 3
  - Level 4 in Knowledge field = 2 VPs
  - Artifact = printed VP
  - Sentinel = 5 + bonus VPs (see below)
  - Update VP markers
- **Check Game End**
  - If ≥5 Sentinels acquired → game ends, highest VP wins
  - Tie → all tied players win; play again

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Magic Energy**: Cards, chits, and dust are interchangeable currency
  - May exchange cards/chits for dust at any time
  - Dust may be consolidated; cannot convert dust to cards
  - Overpayment → change in dust (lost if not possible)
- **Hand Limit**: Determined by starting character and Knowledge fields
  - Adjusted only when first entering a field that modifies it
  - Examples: Knowledge of Gems (-1), Knowledge of Artifacts (+1)
- **Knowledge Fields**:
  - **Knowledge of Gems**: -10% enchant cost per level; disenchant = half current cost; hand limit -1
  - **Knowledge of Energy Flow**: Extra dust: L2=2, L3=5, L4=10; hand limit -1
  - **Knowledge of Fire**: Enables ruby enchantment at L4 (Druid: 1 ruby at L3)
  - **Knowledge of the 9 Sages**: Gain 2 energy cards upon leveling (delayed until next turn); hand limit -1
  - **Knowledge of Artifacts**: Discount: L2/L3=5 (artifacts)/10 (sentinels), L4=10/20; hand limit +1
  - **Knowledge of Accumulation**: Extra active gems: L2/L3=1, L4=2; hand limit +1
- **Turn-Order Adjustments (after any player reaches 10 VPs)**:
  - Player I: +10 (artifacts), +20 (sentinels)
  - Player II: +5 (artifacts), +10 (sentinels) — only if self has ≥10 VPs
  - Player V: -5 (artifacts), -10 (sentinels)
  - Player VI: -10 (artifacts), -20 (sentinels)
- **Sentinel Bonuses**:
  - Phoenix: 2 VP per gem type active (max 10)
  - Owl: 2 VP per Level 4 knowledge (max 12)
  - Fox: 2 VP per active sapphire (max 12)
  - Toad: 2 VP per Spellbook, Elixir, Runestone, Crystal of Protection
  - Unicorn: 1 VP per active diamond (max 11)
  - Tomcat: 2 VP per active opal (max 12)
  - Scarab: 1 VP per active emerald (max 11)
  - Raven: 2 VP per Crystal Ball, Mask of Charisma, Magic Belt, Magic Wand
  - Salamander: 2 VP per active ruby (max 10)
  - All Sentinels: min bid 120, base 5 VP

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Scoring Sources**:
  - Active gems
  - Level 4 in Knowledge fields (2 VP each)
  - Artifacts (printed VP)
  - Sentinels (5 + bonus VP)
- **End Condition**: After Phase 4, if 5 or more Sentinels have been acquired, game ends
- **Winner**: Player with most VPs
- **Tie**: All tied players win; must play again to determine true holder

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I disenchant gems during another player’s turn?**
  Yes — only to pay for an auction you won.
- **Can I improve more than one knowledge field per turn?**
  No — only one level in one field per turn.
- **Do discounts apply during bidding?**
  No — only when paying after winning bid.
- **What happens if I can’t pay exact amount?**
  Overpayment → change in dust (lost if insufficient denominations).
- **Can I have multiple Magic Belts or Wands?**
  No — only one of each allowed.
- **Do bonus energy cards from Knowledge of the 9 Sages count toward hand limit?**
  No — they are stored under turn-order marker until next turn.
- **When do turn-order cost adjustments apply?**
  Only after any player reaches 10 VPs; adjustments depend on current turn order.
