## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
*Wars of the Roses* is a strategic board game set during the historical conflict between the Houses of Lancaster and York for control of the English throne. Players take on the roles of noble factions vying for power through military force, political influence, and strategic bribery. The objective is to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) over five rounds by controlling key locations, influencing personalities (nobles, bishops, ship captains), and securing special titles and bonuses.

In 4-player games, players align with one of two royal houses (Lancastrian or Yorkist). The house that wins Parliament each round crowns a King, granting 5 VPs to its supporters. In 2- or 3-player games, royal houses are not used, and no King is elected.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 5 rounds. Each round consists of 8 phases:

#### Phase 1: Determine Turn Order  
- Turn order is reverse of current standing on the Score Track (lowest score goes first).  
- Ties are broken by previous turn position (i.e., earlier position retains priority).

#### Phase 2: Draw and Pick Cards  
- **Round 1**: Draw 12 cards (for 4 players), 9 cards (3 players), or 12 cards (2 players).  
- **Rounds 2–5**: Draw 8 cards (4 players), 9 cards (3 players), or 8 cards (2 players).  
- Drawing order:  
  - **Round 1**: Alternating order — Player 1, 2, 3, 4, then 4, 3, 2, 1, then 1, 2, 3, 4.  
  - **Rounds 2–5**: Sequential — Player 1, 2, 3, 4, then repeat.  
- After drawing a card, immediately place an ownership cube on a Location or disc on a Personality.  
- For Nobles: Place one counter on starting area with ownership disc, other on Planning Chart.  
- For Ships: One counter stays at home port with disc; one goes to Planning Chart.  
- For Mercenaries: Take troop counters as indicated on Troops chart for the current round; card is removed from play.  
- Any undrawn cards are discarded.

#### Phase 3: Collect Income  
- Collect income from controlled assets: Towns, Bishops, Ports, Ships.  
- **French Aid (Rounds 2–5 only)**: Trailing players may use French Aid token once per game to gain £ equal to the gap between their score and the leader (max £25). Decision made in turn order.

#### Phase 4: Secret Planning (Simultaneous)  
Behind screens, players plan:  
- **Bid for Captain of Calais**: Place money on Planning Chart. Highest bidder wins 4 CPs (Parliament) and 4 VPs (Special Awards). All bids paid to Bank.  
- **Movement**:  
  - Ships: Move up to 2 sea zones.  
  - Nobles: Move to adjacent land area.  
- **Troop Deployment**:  
  - Cost: £3 per Troop.  
  - Can only attack locations where you have presence (via controlled Location, Noble, Bishop, Port, or Royal Castle).  
  - Troops can only be placed on Royal Castles, Towns, and Ports.  
- **Bribery**:  
  - **Black Bribe cube**: Attempt to bribe opponent’s Personality. Cost = 2 × CP or income value.  
  - **White Bribe cube**: Defend own Personality. Cost = 1 × CP or income value.  
  - No presence required to bribe.  
  - Only owned Personalities can be bribed.  
- Once done, flip Royal House token face down.

#### Phase 5: Deployment (Reverse Turn Order)  
- Reveal Planning Charts.  
- Resolve Captain of Calais bid: Highest bidder pays and places token on board with ownership disc.  
- Pay total costs: Troops (£3 each), bribes (black and white), Captain of Calais.  
  - Payment priority if short on funds: Captain of Calais → White bribe → Black bribe → Troops.  
  - Further tiebreakers: Type, vote worth (for nobles); rank (for nobles).  
- Move Ships and Nobles.  
- Place Troops:  
  - Defenders: On location icon.  
  - Attackers: Adjacent to target.  
- Place Mercenaries on Planning Chart.  
- Place **white bribe cubes** on corresponding Personalities on board.

#### Phase 6: Bribery (Reverse Turn Order)  
- Players act in reverse turn order.  
- Place **black bribe cubes** on target opponent’s Personality.  
- If target has a white bribe cube: bribe fails. Both cubes returned.  
- If no white bribe: bribe succeeds.  
  - New owner replaces ownership disc.  
  - Takes Personality card and counter from former owner’s Planning Chart.  
- At end of phase, return all white bribe cubes to owners.

#### Phase 7: Combat (Reverse Turn Order)  
- For each combat:  
  - Defender replaces ownership cube with **garrison troops** (number shown by grey icons next to location).  
  - Attacker and defender remove troops one-for-one (simultaneous resolution).  
  - Survivor wins.  
- After all combats:  
  - Place ownership cube on location (if not neutralized).  
  - Remove all Troop and Mercenary counters from board.  
  - Return Troops to supply; return Mercenaries to Troops chart.

#### Phase 8: Parliament  
- **Regional Scoring**:  
  - Award VPs for most and second-most CPs in each region.  
  - CPs come from controlled Locations and Personalities.  
  - Tiebreaker: Use Control Point Chart (left to right), then turn order.  
- **Parliament Vote (4-player only)**:  
  - Sum CPs for Lancastrian and Yorkist players per region.  
  - House with most CPs in region gains vote.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Control Points (CPs)**: Used for regional dominance and Parliament voting. Derived from controlled assets.  
- **Victory Points (VPs)**: Scored through regional control, King support (4-player), special awards, and bonuses.  
- **Bribery System**: Asymmetric cost — black bribes cost double, white bribes cost single. White bribes act as insurance.  
- **Simultaneous Planning**: Ensures secrecy and strategic bluffing.  
- **Reverse Order Resolution**: Deployment, Bribery, and Combat all resolve in reverse turn order to benefit lower-ranked players.  
- **Presence Requirement**: Needed to attack a location — achieved via controlled asset or Noble in area.  
- **Garrison Troops**: Automatically deployed when defending a location; fixed number per site.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

- **Tiebreaker**:

  2. If still tied, use Control Point Chart order (left to right).

  No. Only owned (active) Personalities can be bribed.
