3. Setup  
- Each player selects a color and receives starships.  
- Players place starships on starting planets.  
- Shuffle the five types of action cards (Movement, Produce, Build, Trade, Score) into separate decks.  
- Reveal one card from each deck at the start of each round.  
- Determine initial first player (implied by ownership of action card effects).

4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of multiple rounds. Each round proceeds through the following five phases in order:

1. **Movement Phase**  
   - The owner of the Movement card moves one of their starships.  
   - Then, each other player (in turn order) moves one starship.  
   - Then, the owner may move any or all of their remaining starships.  
   - Starships can only move to systems shown on the revealed Movement card.  
   - Players cannot move to planets already occupied by another player.

2. **Produce Phase**  
   - The owner of the Produce card chooses one of the two resources shown on the card.  
   - All players (including the owner) produce resources based on their occupied planets and the chosen resource type.

3. **Build Phase**  
   - The owner of the Build card may build any number of items (e.g., starships, structures).  
   - Then, each other player (in turn order) may build one item.

4. **Trade Phase**  
   - All players reveal their resource cards.  
   - The owner of the Trade card may:  
     - Trade resources with any other player (terms negotiated).  
     - Trade with the bank at a 2:1 rate: exchange two of the same resource type for one of any other type.

5. **Score Phase**  
   - The owner of the Score card chooses one of the two elements shown on the card to score.  
   - All players score points (or discard cards, depending on the element) accordingly.  
   - The player who scores the most on that element receives a bonus of 3 points.  
   - In case of a tie for highest score, no bonus is awarded.  
   - The owner of the Score card takes the first player marker.

After the Score phase, the round ends. Discard the used action cards and reveal one new card from each deck for the next round.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Action Card Ownership**: The player who owns the revealed action card in a phase controls the key decision.  
- **Turn Order**: Generally follows clockwise or initiative order, unless specified otherwise (e.g., owner acts first in Movement).  
- **Resource Management**: Players collect, trade, and spend resources to build and expand.  
- **Area Control / Movement Restrictions**: Players cannot move to planets occupied by opponents.  
- **Set Collection & Optimization**: Players aim to maximize output from planets, buildings, and scoring opportunities.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds (exact number not specified in source).  
- Final scoring occurs after the last Score phase.  
- Points are earned through:  
  - Scoring elements during Score phases.  
  - Bonus points (3 per scoring round) awarded only if a player uniquely scores the highest.  
- The player with the most total points wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Tied Highest Score in Scoring Phase**: No player receives the 3-point bonus.  
- **Owner Cannot Build?**: The owner may choose not to build any items during Build phase; other players still get one build.  
- **Trading with Players**: Must be mutually agreed; no forced trades.  
- **Resource Reveal**: All players must reveal resources during Trade phase before any trades occur.  
- **Movement Limitations**: Only systems shown on the Movement card are valid destinations.  
- **Starship Movement Order**: Owner moves one ship, then each opponent moves one ship, then owner may move any remaining ships (no restriction on number).
