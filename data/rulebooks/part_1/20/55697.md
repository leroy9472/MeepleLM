### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in **Rounds**, each with two stages:

#### Stage I: Directors' Meeting (7 Steps)
1. **Dismiss the Chairman**  
   Return the Chairman to their supply. (Skip in Round 1.)
2. **Appoint a New Chairman**  
   The player with the most Managers on the Board becomes Chairman. In case of a tie, the leftmost Manager wins.
3. **Determine New Divisional Heads**  
   For each Division (left to right):
   - Player with most Department Heads becomes Divisional Head.
   - A Main Department counts as 2 Department Heads.
   - Tiebreakers: Employees in Division → Topmost Department Office.
   - If no Department Heads, the player holding the Division’s Privilege Card appoints the Head.
   - If the Divisional Head changes:
     - The outgoing player chooses to move their Manager to the **Board Room** (leftmost vacant seat) or to the **Counsel Track** (as Consultant).
4. **Hand Out Privilege Cards**  
   Each Divisional Head and the Chairman receive their respective Privilege Cards (face up, Division side).
5. **Score Influence Points**  
   - Chairman: +2 Influence
   - Each Board Member: +1 Influence
6. **Adjust Motivation Marker**  
   Reset to space **6**.
7. **Sort Event Cards**  
   The **Communications Divisional Head**:
   - Takes all Event Cards
   - Removes the two Standard Event Cards ("Bonus Payment", "Directors' Meeting")
   - Shuffles the remaining 24, draws 6
   - Adds the 2 Standard Cards back, arranging all 8 in a stack with these rules:
     - "Bonus Payment" must come **before** "Directors' Meeting"
     - "Directors' Meeting" must be **5th or later**
   - This determines the number of Department Turns (4–7).

#### Stage II: Department Turns
Repeat until "Directors' Meeting" card is drawn:
1. **Event Step**  
   The Communications Head reveals the top Event Card and resolves it immediately.
2. **Action Step**  
   Starting with the Communications Head, each player takes **one action** in clockwise order.

C) **Restructure Departments**  
   - **Move**: Relocate 1–2 Departments or 1 Main Department to another Division (same Employee count).
   - **Create Main Department**: Merge 2 of your Departments. Both Managers remain. Remove 2 Employees. Score 1 point on Main Department track.

D) **Resign as Divisional Head**  
   - Move your Divisional Head to:
     - **Board Room**: All your Department Heads in that Division move to the Board. All Employees in that Division (including in Main Departments) are fired.
     - **Counsel Track**: Become a Consultant. All your non-Main Department Managers and Employees in that Division are fired.
   - The Division’s Privilege Card is turned face down.

E) **Bribe for Privilege Cards**  
   - Secretly place ≥50,000 Pinats in your Bribe Folder and offer it to another player for a specific Privilege Card.
   - You score **1 Corruption Point** regardless of outcome.
   - If accepted:
     - The bribed player scores 1 Corruption Point.
     - You receive the card, placed with **Bribed side (gold)** facing you.
   - If rejected:
     - You may make **one additional bribe attempt**.
     - The rejecting player loses **1 Employee** (you choose which), unless they accept a later bribe or have no Employees.

F) **Gain Points on Competence Tracks**  
   - **Influence**: Fire 3 Employees → +1 Influence.
   - **Main Department**: Pay 1,500,000 → Place 2 Managers in a vacant Department Office → +1 Main Department point.
   - **Counsel (Consultant)**: Pay 2,000,000 → Place 1 Manager on Counsel Track in any Division → +1 Consultant.
   - **Shares**: Buy a Block of Shares → +1 point per Share in the Block.

G) **Use Privilege Cards**  
   - **Development**: Steal 1 (normal) or 3 (bribed) Employees from other players (1 max per player) or take from supply.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Privilege Card Use After Resignation**: If a Divisional Head resigns, the Privilege Card is turned face down and **cannot be used** for the rest of the round.

- **Moving Employees**: Employees can only be moved when:
  - Creating new Departments (Action B1)
  - Using the Chairman Privilege Card
- **Winning After a Bribe**: If you gain your 4th VP **after** your action (e.g., by accepting a bribe), you **cannot trigger the end**. You must wait until **another player triggers it**, or until **your next action**.
- **Motivation Marker**: Reset to 6 every Directors' Meeting. Events can raise or lower it.
- **Board Full**: When adding a Manager, shift all current members left; the leftmost is dismissed.
- **Department Vacancy**: When a Department Office becomes vacant, lower Departments in the same Division move up.
