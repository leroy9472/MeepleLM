# LYNGK — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
LYNGK is the seventh and synthesizing game of the GIPF project. It unites mechanics and elements from the six previous games in the series. The goal is to form stacks of 5 differently colored pieces. Victory is awarded to the player who controls the most such stacks at the end of the game.

### 2. Components
- 1 game board (hexagonal grid with 37 intersection points)
- 3 white mottled pieces (jokers; reference: GIPF)
- 9 ivory pieces (reference: TZAAR)
- 9 blue pieces (reference: ZÈRTZ)
- 9 red pieces (reference: DVONN)
- 9 green pieces (reference: PÜNCT)
- 9 black pieces (reference: YINSH)
- 1 cloth bag
- Rulebook (multiple languages)

### 3. Setup
1. Randomly place 8 pieces of each of the 5 active colors (ivory, blue, red, green, black) and all 3 white joker pieces on the board, filling all 37 intersection points.
2. Place the remaining 5 pieces (1 of each active color) beside the board. These are not used in play but serve to claim colors.
3. Determine the starting player by lot.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Players take turns.
- On a turn, a player may (but does not have to) claim a color before making a move.
- A move consists of selecting and moving one piece or stack.
- The turn ends after the move is completed. The opponent then takes their turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Joker, Neutral, and Claimed Pieces
- The 3 white mottled pieces are jokers. They represent any of the 5 active colors but are passive: they cannot initiate a move and can only be moved as part of a stack.
- At the start, all colored pieces (ivory, blue, red, green, black) are neutral—belonging to neither player and playable by both.
- Each player may claim two colors during the game, one per turn, before making their move. To claim a color, they take the corresponding spare piece from beside the board and place it in front of them.
- Once a color is claimed, only the owning player may move pieces or stacks of that color.
- After both players have claimed two colors each, the fifth active color remains neutral—its pieces may be moved by either player for the rest of the game.

#### Movement Rules
1. A player must move a piece or stack of a neutral color or one of their claimed colors.
2. Stacks must be moved as a whole. The top piece determines the ownership (neutral or claimed).
3. A move must end on an occupied spot—either on a single piece or on top of a stack.
4. Movement is allowed:
   - To an adjacent occupied spot.
   - Along a straight line to a reachable spot, crossing only empty intersections.
   - Jumping over empty spots is allowed; jumping over pieces or stacks is not.
5. Stack size limit: a stack may contain at most 5 pieces.
6. Stack composition rule: a stack may only contain one piece of each active color. Multiple white jokers are allowed, as they can represent any missing color(s).
7. A single neutral piece (of an unclaimed color) may only move onto another single piece (of any other color), not onto a stack.
8. A stack with a neutral piece on top may move onto:
   - A single piece.
   - A stack of equal or smaller height.
   - It may not move onto a taller stack.
9. A single piece of a claimed color or a stack with a claimed color on top may move onto any other piece or stack, provided:
   - The resulting stack has ≤5 pieces.
   - All pieces in the stack are of different colors.

#### The LYNGK Rule
- Applies only when moving a piece or stack of a claimed color.
- Allows multiple consecutive moves in a single turn by using same-colored pieces as "LYNGK-points."
- To execute:
  1. Move a claimed piece/stack toward another of the same claimed color.
  2. Do not place it on top—use the destination as a transfer point (LYNGK-point).
  3. Continue the move from that point to another reachable piece/stack.
  4. Repeat as long as each intermediate landing is a piece/stack with the same claimed color on top.
  5. The move ends when the piece lands on a piece/stack where it may legally stay.
- Restrictions:
  - A joker cannot be used as a LYNGK-point.
  - A LYNGK-point cannot be used more than once per turn.
  - Only the top piece of a stack matters when determining its color for LYNGK purposes.

#### Scoring Moves
- When a player completes a 5-piece stack with one of their claimed colors on top, they must remove it from the board and place it in front of them. This stack is worth 1 point.
- If a 5-piece stack is completed with a neutral color on top, it remains on the board as an obstacle and scores no points for either player.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- The game ends when no further moves are possible.
- The player with the most 5-piece stacks removed wins.
- Tiebreakers:
  1. Most 4-piece stacks on the board.
  2. Most 3-piece stacks.
  3. Most 2-piece stacks.
  4. Most single pieces.
- If all counts are equal, the game ends in a draw.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I pass?** Only if you have no legal move.
- **What if I can't move?** Your opponent continues playing until they also cannot move.
- **Can I reclaim a color?** No. Once claimed, a color belongs to that player.
- **Can a stack contain multiple jokers?** Yes. They represent different missing colors.
- **Can I use a neutral stack in a LYNGK move?** Only if its top piece is of your claimed color.
- **Can I claim both my colors in one turn?** No. One per turn.
