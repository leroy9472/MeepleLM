# High Frontier — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the near future, private and government enterprises race to establish a buckytube mechanosynthesis factory on a carbonaceous asteroid. The key to success is mastering In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) — extracting water from space instead of Earth — to gain the strategic high ground for industrialization and profit.

**Objective**: Be the first to industrialize extraterrestrial (ET) sites by prospecting and building ET factories. Victory is determined by accumulating the most Victory Points (VP) through factories, claims, space ventures, and glory achievements.

### 2. Components  
- **Map**: Represents the solar system with routes, burns (red circles), L-points, site hexes, and heliocentric zones (Mercury to Jupiter).  
- **Player Mats**: Track rocket fuel, dry mass, modified thrust, and hold LEO, outpost, and freighter stacks.  
- **Cards**: 24 patent cards (8 thrusters, 8 robonauts, 8 refineries), each with white (Earth-built) and black (space-built) sides.  
- **Crew Cards**: One per player (NASA, ESA, PRC, UN, Shimizu), each with faction-specific privileges.  
- **Tokens**:  
  - Transparent disks (WT): Represent water tanks (fuel and currency).  
  - Colored opaque disks: Claim markers.  
  - Black disks: Busted sites.  
  - Colored cubes: Factories, colonies, freighters.  
  - Rockets (1 per player): Track position and fuel.  
- **Placeholder Sheet**: Holds patent decks and tracks Resource Exploitation Tracks (VP values by product letter).  
- **Dice**: One six-sided die for hazard and prospecting rolls.

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player chooses a faction, takes matching components (6 cubes, 6 disks, 2 rockets, crew card), and places 4 WT in their orbital depot.  
2. Shuffle patent cards into three decks (Thrusters, Robonauts, Refineries) and place face-up on the Placeholder Sheet.  
3. Place one blue disk at the start of each of the four Resource Exploitation Tracks (C, M, S, V).  
4. Randomly determine first player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn:  
1. **Move Phase**:  
   - Calculate modified thrust.  
   - Move rocket and/or freighter.  
2. **Operation Phase**: Choose one operation: Income, Research, Free Market, Boost, Site Refuel, Prospect, Industrialize, or ET Production.  
3. Proceed clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Rocket Movement  
- **Modified Thrust**:  
  - Base thrust (from thruster card) + modifiers:  
    - Wet mass modifier (from fuel diagram).  
    - Solar zone modifier (if solar-powered).  
    - ESA beamed power (+1).  
    - Afterburner: Spend fuel steps (flame icon) to +1 thrust (once per turn).  
  - Must be ≥1 to move.  
- **Burns**: Each red circle entered costs fuel steps equal to thruster’s fuel consumption.  
- **Hohmann Pivot**: Turning at a cross intersection costs 2 burns.  
- **Coasting**: Continue moving after max burns or out of fuel, but cannot enter new burns or pivot.  
- **Hazards**:  
  - **Crash (skull)**: Roll d6; 1 = decommission rocket.  
  - **Aerobrake (parachute)**: Roll d6; 1 = decommission rocket. Sails are always decommissioned.  
  - Avoid roll by paying 4 WT.  
- **Landing**:  
  - **Unfueled**: Modified thrust > site size.  
  - **Fueled**: Pay fuel steps = site size.  
  - **Aerobrake**: Follow dotted line to site; risk hazard roll.  
- **Lift-off**:  
  - Unfueled if thrust > site size.  
  - Otherwise, pay fuel steps = site size.  
- **Freighter Movement**: Thrust = 1, no fuel, can only land at player’s factories.

#### Operations  
- **Income**: Gain 1 WT.  
- **Research**: Auction top card of any deck. Bidding open; high bidder wins. Shimizu may bid regardless of hand size.  
- **Free Market**:  
  - Sell white card from hand: 3 WT.  
  - Decommission black card in LEO: Gain WT = current VP value of its product letter.  
- **Boost**: Pay 1 WT per mass to move white or crew card from hand to LEO or rocket. NASA gains 1 WT when any player boosts.  
- **Site Refuel**:  
  - With ISRU card: Gain WT = (site hydration + 1) – ISRU.  
  - At own factory: Fill up to 8 WT.  
  - PRC may refuel at others’ sites without permission.  
- **Prospect**:  
  - Requires ISRU ≤ site hydration.  
  - Roll d6 ≤ site size to succeed. Place claim (red disk); failure = black disk (busted).  
  - **Buggy**: Re-roll once or prospect all connected sites (e.g., Mars).  
  - **Raygun**: Prospect adjacent non-atmospheric sites from space.  
- **Industrialize**:  
  - At own claim, decommission robonaut and refinery.  
  - Place factory cube.  
  - Choose factory product: flip one matching black card in hand.  
  - Lower corresponding Resource Exploitation Track by one.  
- **ET Production**:  
  - Play black card from hand to stack at matching factory.  
  - Can create rocket, outpost, or freighter.  
- **Deal-Making**: Trade WT, LEO cards (white/crew), or promises. WT can be transferred between cooperating stacks.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Triggers**:  
- 2 players: 4 factories built.  
- 3 players: 6 factories.  
- 4–5 players: 7 factories.  
- OR: A player with 3 factories or 2 space ventures may end game by paying 5 WT.

**Scoring**:  
- **Base VP**: 1 VP per claim, factory, or colony cube.  
- **Factories**: Additional VP from Resource Exploitation Track (decreases with each factory of same letter).  
- **Glory**:  
  - First to land and return crew from Mars, Mercury, or science site: +3 VP.  
  - First to return crew from any site: +3 VP (can earn both).  
- **Space Ventures**:  
  - **Space Pharmacy (S)**: Claim 3 S sites → +5 VP.  
  - **Space Tourism (V)**: Claim 3 V sites + pay 5 WT → +7 VP and 2 operations/turn.  
  - **Space Elevator (M)**: Claim 3 M sites + pay 7 WT → +8 VP and direct LEO–L2 route.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Most WT.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I boost black cards?** No. Must flip to white side first.  
- **Can I land with thrust ≤ site size?** Yes, by paying lander fuel = site size.  
- **Can I aerobrake without a sail?** Yes, but risk hazard roll. Sail cards are decommissioned.  
- **Can I prospect a site with atmosphere using a raygun?** No. Raygun cannot fire into atmospheric sites from space.  
- **Can I industrialize without a robonaut?** No. Must decommission both robonaut and refinery.  
- **Can I retool my factory product later?** Yes. Use Industrialize to flip a new matching card to black side; flip old one back.  
- **Can I have more than one rocket?** No. Must decommission or convert old rocket to outpost first.  
- **Can I refuel at a busted site?** Yes. Water extraction still possible.  
- **Can I claim jump?** PRC only. Requires crew, opponent’s claim has no cube or crew present.  
- **Can I transfer fuel between rockets?** Only at LEO/start orbit with cooperating stacks.
