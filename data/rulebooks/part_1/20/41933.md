### 1. Lore & Objective
In 2097, a global climate shift triggered a catastrophic ice age, eliminating over 90% of Earth’s population. Survivors formed tribes to scavenge dwindling resources and fight for dominance. In *Arctic Scavengers*, players lead tribes competing to survive by gathering resources, hiring mercenaries, and winning skirmishes. The objective is to build the largest tribe by total number of people represented on cards in your deck when the final Contested Resource is claimed.

### 2. Components
- 144 playing cards, categorized as:
  - **Starter Deck (per player):** 4 Refugee, 3 Scavenger, 1 Brawler, 1 Spear, 1 Shovel
  - **Contested Resources (CR):** Special cards (e.g., Sled Team, Field Crew, Grenades) obtained via skirmishes
  - **Junkyard (JY):** Cards drawn during DIG actions (includes tools, medicine, junk)
  - **Mercenaries:** Hireable cards (e.g., Hunter, Medic, Engineer) with costs
  - **Tools:** Modify actions (e.g., Spear, Shovel, Toolkit)
  - **Medicine:** Used as currency (Pills, Medkit)
  - **Buildings (HQ Expansion):** Armory, Bunker, Hydroponic Gardens, Pharmacy, etc.
  - **Tribal Leaders (HQ Expansion):** Grant special abilities
- 1 Initiator card
- 1 Junkyard mat
- 1 Contested Resources mat

### 3. Setup
1. Each player receives a starter deck (10 cards), shuffles it, and places it face-down.
2. Remove extra Refugee cards from play.
3. Sort remaining cards into:
   - **Contested Resources (CR):** Shuffle and place face-down on CR mat.
   - **Junkyard (JY):** Shuffle and place face-down on JY mat.
   - **Mercenaries:** Sort into 8 face-up stacks by type.
4. Randomly select first player; give them the Initiator card.
5. **2-Player Variant:** Remove 2 of each Junkyard card type; skirmishes must be won by 2+ points; tiebreakers ignore number of people.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round follows this sequence:
1. **Drawing Phase:**
   - Discard all used cards.
   - Draw 5 cards from your deck (shuffle discard pile if needed).
   - From Round 3 onward, the Initiator peeks at the top CR card and returns it unseen.

2. **Resource Gathering Phase:**
   - Starting with the Initiator, players take turns using cards to perform actions.
   - Actions may be taken in any order, but each standard action only once per round.
   - After gathering, announce how many cards you are saving for the Skirmish (face-down bluff allowed).

3. **Skirmish Phase (Rounds 3+):**
   - All players simultaneously reveal skirmish cards.
   - Starting with the Initiator, players declare special actions (Sniper, Saboteur, etc.) in turn order.
   - Remaining Fight values are totaled.
   - Highest total wins the top CR card.
   - Ties: resolved by total number of people in skirmish. Further ties = deadlock (CR placed on top of JY and shuffled).
   - Pass Initiator card to the left.

4. The game ends when the last CR card is won.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Actions (once per round unless specified)
- **DRAW:** Draw cards from your deck. Total DRAW value from played cards determines number drawn.
- **DIG:** Draw N cards from the top of the Junkyard (N = total DIG value). Keep 1, return others to the bottom. Junk cards may be discarded immediately.
- **HUNT:** Generate food equal to total HUNT value. Can be enhanced with hunting tools (e.g., Spear).
- **HIRE:** Free action. Spend food (from HUNT) and/or medicine cards (Pills = 1 med, Medkit = 2) to hire one mercenary per round.
- **TRASH:** Discard any number of cards from hand to Junkyard (placed on top, then shuffled).
- **BUILD (HQ Expansion):** Use Engineer to DIG in Schematics deck. Choose 1 building, place build timer cards (equal to build time) on it. Remove 1 timer card per round. Additional tribe members (or Toolkit) can accelerate construction.
- **STORE/RETRIEVE (HQ Expansion):** Use completed buildings (Armory, Bunker, Pharmacy) to store and retrieve cards. Unlimited uses per turn, except during skirmish.

#### Tools & Modifiers
- Tools enhance actions but require a base ability (e.g., Shovel boosts DIG only if played with a card that can DIG).
- Only one tool per tribe member.
- Group Leaders are not tools; they can stack to modify a single ability.
- Tools cannot be used by cards lacking the base action.

#### Skirmish Mechanics
- Fight value = sum of Fight (×) values, including tool bonuses.
- **Sniper Team:** Discard one opponent’s person card. Can be used during resource gathering or skirmish. Discarded after use unless used in skirmish (then remains for tiebreak).
- **Saboteur:** Disarm one opponent’s tool. Same usage as Sniper. Discarded after use unless used in skirmish.
- Special actions resolve in turn order. Later players can snipe/disarm earlier players’ units.
- Cards used in special actions do not contribute Fight value but count toward tiebreak (number of people).
- After a snipe, tools may be reassigned.

#### HQ Expansion Additions
- **Buildings:**
  - **Armory:** Store up to 2 tools; retrieve anytime (except during skirmish).
  - **Bunker:** Store up to 3 tribe members; retrieve anytime (except during skirmish). Can be accessed during opponents’ turns.
  - **Hydroponic Gardens:** Generate 1 food per round (independent of HUNT).
  - **Pharmacy:** Store up to 2 medicine cards; retrieve anytime (except during skirmish).
- **Tribal Leaders:** Require Refugee to activate (except Butcher/Cannibal/Fanatic/Sergeant at Arms). Abilities vary (e.g., Organizer allows extra DRAW; Fanatic can sabotage during others’ turns).
- **Engineer:** Can DIG in Schematics deck to start buildings. Can team with Tinker.

#### Recon Expansion Additions
- **Spy:** Peek at up to 4 cards from one player’s hand, deck, building, or skirmish force. Discard after use; draw 1 card.
- **Binoculars:** Peek at top card of every pile (CR, JY, Schematics). Discard after use.
- **Rogue:** In tied skirmish, first player with Rogue wins (higher precedence than people count).
- **Provocateur:** Use total number of tribe members (ignoring tools) as Fight score.
- **Map:** Reuse a tribe member in a second action this round (but action still only once).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends when the last CR card is claimed.
- **Scoring:**
  1. Count total number of people in your tribe (sum of person icons in bottom corner of all cards in your deck).
  2. **Tiebreakers:**
     - Most Contested Resource cards.
     - Largest deck (most cards).
     - Shared victory if still tied.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Junkyard Shuffling:** Shuffle when cards are added via TRASH or tied skirmish (placed on top).
- **DIG Returns:** Cards not kept go to the bottom of the Junkyard (no shuffle).
- **Sniper/Saboteur in Resource Gathering:** Can be played from hand or skirmish reserve. Discarded after use. Targeted player may reclaim other cards.
- **Sniper/Saboteur in Skirmish:** Not discarded immediately; contribute to tiebreak.
- **Multiple Group Leaders:** Can stack on one card.
- **Ties in Skirmish:** First compare Fight values, then number of people. Still tied = deadlock.
- **2-Player Skirmishes:** Must win by 2+; no people tiebreak.
- **Building Use:** Only Bunker accessible during opponents’ turns. No building use during skirmish.
- **Disabling Buildings (Dirty Deeds):** Saboteur can disable a completed building (flip over). Repair by playing a person card and discarding it.
- **Wounding Leaders (Dirty Deeds):** Sniper can wound a Tribal Leader (flip over). Heal with 1 medicine.
