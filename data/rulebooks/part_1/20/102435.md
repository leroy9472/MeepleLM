# Navajo Wars Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Navajo Wars is a solitaire historical strategy game set in the 18th and 19th centuries, where the player leads the Diné (Navajo) people through periods of conflict with Spanish, Mexican, and American forces. The game progresses through a series of event cards that trigger operations, major events, and transitions between historical eras. The player must manage population, resources, culture, and military strength to survive and ultimately achieve victory.

Victory is determined at the end of the game or through automatic victory conditions during play. The player wins by maintaining sufficient Military and Culture relative to Enemy Morale, or loses if both fall to zero.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Card Draw Phase**: Reveal top card.
2. **Operations Segment**:
   - Choose: Pre-empt (Player first) or let Enemy go first.
   - **Enemy Operations**:
     a. Resolve "Peace"/"Defend" if counter in Raided Cubes Box.
     b. Collect Enemy APs: +1 per red cube in Subjugation of NM; -1 per cube in Raided Cubes; min 1.
     c. Flip/Swap Instructions: Roll 2d6. Doubles = swap Active/Standby if possible. Else, flip non-striped Active counters matching die rolls.
     d. Execute Enemy Instructions: Top-down from Active column. Pay AP cost. Stop when insufficient APs.
     e. Reset Enemy Instruction Display.
   - **Player Operations** (choose one):
     - **Planning**: Age Elders, gain APs, perform Elder Actions, buy Trade Goods, conduct Tribal Warfare/Diplomacy, Reset Cubes.
     - **Take Actions**: Activate Families (number = Elders + max(1, Families in Canyon de Chelly)). Each gets MPs = 6 - empty population spaces. Spend MPs on actions.
     - **Passage of Time**: Adjust population, return/breed animals, harvest corn, feed population/animals, elder death check, land recovery, return corn, Pueblo Revolt check, Reset Cubes.
3. **Major Event**: Follow card text. For Ceremony cards, optional: if discarded during resolution, check matching Territory die roll. If Families present, activate and Take Actions; else, lose Culture equal to Territory's VP.
4. **Minor Event** (Operations cards only):
   - Drought: Roll d6, place in corresponding Territory; if full, place in adjacent with highest die roll.
   - Drought Recovery: Roll d6, remove from corresponding Territory; if none, remove from adjacent with lowest die roll.
   - Swap Instructions: Roll d6, swap Active/Standby if both present.
   - Reset Cubes: Recovery → Raid Pool; Raided Cubes → Recovery.
5. **Victory Check**: Conduct Good Medicine or Victory Check.
6. **Discard Phase**:
   - If Family stacked with Fort, lose 1 Culture or 1 Military (total).
   - Check automatic conditions:
     - 0 Culture AND 0 Military → Major Defeat.
     - Enemy Morale = 0 AND no Families in Forts: roll d6. If > # Outposts + Forts → Major Victory; else, set Enemy Morale = # Outposts + Forts (optional: set = die roll).
     - Enemy Morale = 0 AND Family in Fort → set Enemy Morale = # Outposts + Forts.
   - Discard card (or place face-up if persistent).
   - Set Ferocity = 0 for Families without a Man.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Enemy Instructions**: Executed in Active column order. Costs paid from Enemy APs. After execution, counter moves to Inactive. Reset after execution phase.
- **Take Actions**:
  - Find New Water Hole: 9 MPs - Area Value. Remove 1 Drought from Territory.
  - Move to Adjacent Area: Cost = destination Area Value +1 if Outpost in ≥Value Area on track, +1 if Territory has Fort, +die roll if in Fort Area and no MPs spent.
  - Move to/from Canyon de Chelly: All MPs. Cannot use if stacked with Fort.
  - Plant Corn: Cost = Area Value +4. Draw Corn, place face-down in Area (max 1 per Area).
  - Harvest Corn: No cost. If no Drought/Rancho, reveal. Else, roll d6; if > # Drought + Ranchos, reveal.
  - Raid New Mexico: Req: Military >0, Man, not in Fort. Normal: Cost = Areas to Santa Fe. Long-Range: Spend all MPs. Draw cube, consult Raid Table.
  - Raid Outpost/Fort: Req: Military >0, Man, same or lower Area. Cost = current Area Value. Draw cubes until destroyed, Battle forced, or "Raid Ends".
  - Trade at Fort: Req: in Fort Area. Cost: all remaining MPs (min 1). Gain Trade Goods, spend 1 Culture, set Ferocity = 0.
  - Tribal Council: Req: no MPs spent. Cost: all MPs. Roll d6 ≥ Area Value → gain 1 AP.
- **Player Reactions to Raids**:
  - Ambush: Cost 1 AP. Req: Military >0, Ferocity >0. Battle with double Ferocity (max Area Value). Success removes all Raid counters (except Santa Fe).
  - Negotiate: Cost 1 AP. Spend Trade Goods for +1 DRM each. Roll d6 + Evasion + Trade Goods. ≥6 success (natural 1 fail, 6 success). Affected Families go to Escape box.
  - Harass: Cost 1 AP. Req: Man. Place Harass counter ≤3 Areas away. Raid requires 2 counters to enter.
  - Evade: Free. Roll d6 + Evasion. > Area Value → move to Area = result (natural 1 fail; 6 or ≥7 → Area 6 or Canyon de Chelly). Cannot move into Raided Area.
- **Trade Goods**: Spend 3 Animals or 6 Corn to gain 1 Trade Good. Benefits:
  - 2 Trade Goods = 1 AP
  - 2 Trade Goods = cancel Instruction flip
  - 3 Trade Goods = 1 animal from Out of Play
  - 3 Trade Goods = reroll dice or redraw cube
  - 3 Trade Goods = cancel Minor Event or Enemy Way effect

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Automatic Victory**: During Discard Phase, if Enemy Morale = 0 and no Families in Forts: roll d6. If > # Outposts + Forts → Major Victory; else, set Enemy Morale = # Outposts + Forts.
- **Automatic Defeat**: If 0 Culture AND 0 Military → Major Defeat.
- **End of Game (after card #42)**: Calculate (Military) - (Enemy Morale) - (# black cubes in Subjugation of NM). Result:
  - ≥3: Major Victory
  - 1–2: Minor Victory
  - 0, -1, -2: Minor Defeat
  - ≤-3: Major Defeat
- **Transitional Events**:
  - **Mexican Independence (#45)**: Conduct Passage of Time, Victory Check (VP=14). Set Enemy Morale = Military. Transition to Mexican period.
  - **Army of the West (#50)**: Same, VP=14. Transition to American period.
  - **Kit Carson (#55)**: VP=15. If Military > Morale → Major Victory. Else, choose preemptive war (Take Actions; win if no Outposts/Forts) or retreat (Tribal Raids, lose Military for Passage of Time counters, Morale loss per Family outside Canyon, final assault on Canyon).

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Family Ferocity**: Set to 0 at end of turn if no Man in Family.
- **Peace Condition**: Ends if any Family raids NM or Outpost/Fort.
- **Canyon de Chelly**: All Territories adjacent. No Drought. No Tribal Raids. Families cannot React to Raids.
- **Intruders**: During Mexican/American periods, Unrevealed Intruders add Enemy APs (+1 per 2 for Mexican Independence, +1 each for Army of the West). One new Intruder placed at end of Enemy Operations.
- **Animal Trade**: 2 animals of one type → 1 of other, at any time.
- **Hand Limit**: No limit on Ceremony cards.
