### 1. Lore & Objective
Beseige your opponent's towers and block their movements. The goal is to restrict your opponent so they can no longer make a legal move.

### 2. Components
- 8 hexagonal board pieces (4 per player)  
- 16 white counters (for White player)  
- 16 red counters (for Red player)  

### 3. Setup
A. **Board Construction**:  
   - Players alternate placing hexagonal board pieces.  
   - The first piece is placed freely.  
   - Each subsequent piece must be edge-connected to at least one already-placed piece.  
   - Continue until all 8 hexagons are placed.  

B. **Tower Placement**:  
   - White stacks all 16 of their counters into a single tower and places it on any edge hex of the board.  
   - Red does the same with their 16 counters, placing their tower on a different edge hex.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. White takes the first turn; turns alternate thereafter.  
2. On a player’s turn:  
   a. Select any one of their stacks (towers).  
   b. Split the stack into two non-empty parts.  
   c. Move one part (at least one piece) to a new location by sliding it in a straight line along a row of hexagons.  
   d. The moving stack must travel at least one hex.  
   e. Movement stops when reaching an obstacle (any stack of pieces, friendly or enemy).  
   f. The moved pieces are placed in the last empty hex before the obstacle.  
   g. At least one piece must remain in the original hex after the split.  

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Splitting**: A stack may be divided in any way, as long as both resulting parts have at least one piece.  
- **Movement**:  
  - Movement is in straight lines only (along hex rows: 6 possible directions).  
  - The moved portion travels as far as possible in a straight line but must stop before entering a hex occupied by any stack.  
  - If all adjacent directions from a stack are blocked by other pieces, that stack cannot move.  
- **Blocking**: A player may use their own or opponent’s stacks as movement barriers.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- The game ends when a player cannot make a legal move on their turn.  
- A legal move requires:  
  - At least one of the player’s stacks can be split (leaving at least one piece behind), and  
  - At least one piece can be moved at least one hex in a straight line (stopping before any obstacle).  
- If a player cannot do this, they lose.  
- The other player wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I move through empty spaces?**  
  Yes, as long as the path is straight and unobstructed. Movement stops only when the next hex contains a stack.  

- **Can I move a single piece?**  
  Yes. Any number ≥1 may be moved, as long as ≥1 remains behind.  

- **Can I move a stack onto an occupied hex?**  
  No. Movement must stop in the last empty hex before any occupied hex.  

- **Can I split a stack of 1?**  
  No. A stack of 1 cannot be split (you cannot leave zero behind). Therefore, single-piece stacks are immobile.  

- **What happens if the board is fully surrounded?**  
  The player unable to move loses.  

- **Can I move a stack in any direction?**  
  Yes, as long as it's a straight line along the hex grid and the movement is at least one hex.
