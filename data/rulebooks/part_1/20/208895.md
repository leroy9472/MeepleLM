## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
New York Slice is a strategic pizza-splitting game where players take turns acting as the Slicer, dividing a pizza into portions for others to choose. The goal is to collect slices strategically, manage special bonuses, and score the most points by the end of the game. Victory goes to the player who best balances collection, consumption, and special abilities.

### 2. Components
- 69 Pizza slices (including numbered, combo, supreme, and anchovy types)
- 14 Today’s Special Chalkboards (special ability tiles)
- 1 Guest Check pad (for scoring)

### 3. Setup

#### Player Adjustments:
- **2 Players**: Remove 10 Meat Lovers, 8 Mushrooms, 3 Veggies, and the 8/10 combo slice with Mushrooms and Meat Lovers.
- **3, 4, or 6 Players**: Use all slices.
- **5 Players**: Remove 10 Meat Lovers and the 8/10 combo slice with Mushrooms and Meat Lovers.

#### Shuffling:
- Shuffle all pizza slices face down. Create three stacks of 11 slices each. Return the remaining 3 face-down slices to the box.
- Shuffle the 14 Today’s Specials face down. Place one Special on top of each stack of 11 slices. Return the remaining 6 Specials to the box.

#### First Slicer:
- The last player to win any game becomes the first Slicer.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- The game lasts 3 rounds (one per stack).
- In each round:
  1. The Slicer selects a stack and its Special.
  2. Flip the Special face up and read it aloud.
  3. Flip all 11 slices face up, arranging them in a circle in the order they were flipped (no reordering allowed).
  4. The Slicer divides the pizza into portions equal to the number of players. Each portion must contain at least one slice or the Special (which may be its own portion).
  5. Starting with the player to the Slicer’s left, each player chooses a portion in clockwise order.
  6. After choosing, a player decides which slices to **collect** (keep face up) or **eat** (place face down). Only slices with pepperoni can be eaten.
  7. The Slicer chooses last.
- After the round, the Slicer role passes to the left.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Pizza Types:
- **Numbered Slices** (e.g., Veggie 3, Cheese 11): Number = quantity in game and points if majority collected.
  - Pepperoni: +1 point per pepperoni when **eaten**.
  - Anchovies: –1 point each if **collected**. Anchovies on eaten slices are ignored.
- **Combo Slices** (4 total): Each gives +½ slice to two pizza types.
  - Cannot be eaten unless Combo Cravings Special is active.
- **Anchovy Slice**: Cannot be eaten; worth –3 points if collected.
- **Supreme Slice**:
  - When collected, must attach to an existing slice type and becomes part of that type.
  - If alone, must attach to first slice collected later.
  - If eaten: worth +2 points (2 pepperonis).

#### Today’s Specials:
- One Special is added to each pizza stack per round.
- Slicer assigns Special to a portion or makes it its own portion.
- Blue Specials (marked with *) are scored directly on the Guest Check.
- Key Specials:
  - **Buffet\***: +1 point per different pizza type collected. Half slices count as full types if you have no whole slice.
  - **Combo Craving\***: Each Combo slice eaten = +3 points. Allows eating of Combo slices (normally not allowed).
  - **Cut in Line**: Choose portion first (before others) in a future round.
  - **Day-Old Pizza\***: –2 points.
  - **Dibs!**: Before slicing, claim a specific slice. Slicer must ask owner if they want to use it.
  - **Everyone-Else Diet\***: All others lose 1 point per 2 eaten slices (rounded down).
  - **Mystery Slice**: Draw one of the 3 leftover face-down slices. Can eat or collect.
  - **Seconds**: Before scoring, eat any number of pepperoni slices of one type.
  - **Sneak-a-Slice**: Before choosing, move one slice to an adjacent portion (once only).
  - **Stuffed Crust\***: +5 points.
  - **Supersize Combos**: Combo slices = +2 slices (instead of +½) for each type.
  - **Tiebreaker**: Win all majority ties for slice types.
  - **You Like Anchovies!**: Anchovies on collected slices = +1 point each (change – to + on score sheet).
  - **You Love Veggies\***: Each Veggie slice eaten = +3 points. Can eat collected Veggie slices when this is gained.

#### Scoring Lines on Guest Check:
- **Pizza Type Scoring**: Points for majority in each type.
- **Special\***: Points from blue-marked Specials.
- **Pepperonis – Anchovies**: (Pepperonis eaten) – (Anchovies on collected slices).
- **Final Score**: Sum of all lines.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- After 3 rounds, game ends.
- **Scorekeeper**: Player best at calculating tips.
- **Scoring Steps**:
  1. **Pizza Type Scoring**:
     - For each type (Veggie 3 to Cheese 11), the player with **most collected slices** scores the type’s value.
     - Tie = no one scores.
     - Half slice counts as majority if no one has full slices.
  2. **Special\* Scoring**:
     - Total points from blue-marked Specials.
  3. **Pepperoni & Anchovy Scoring**:
     - (Number of pepperonis on eaten slices) – (number of anchovies on collected slices).
     - Anchovies on eaten slices and pepperonis on collected slices are ignored.
  4. **Final Scoring**:
     - Add all points.
     - **Tiebreakers**:
       1. Most eaten slices (not pepperonis).
       2. If still tied, share victory and split the check.
