## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *The Adventurers: The Temple of Chac*, players take on the roles of rival explorers racing through a cursed Mayan temple to collect as much treasure as possible before deadly traps seal their fate. The temple is filled with ancient artifacts, but also with collapsing floors, rolling boulders, closing walls, and treacherous rivers. The goal is to escape with the most valuable haul. In cooperative play, the group must collectively extract a minimum total treasure value depending on player count and complexity level.

   - Place backup card (game aid side up) under active card.  
   - Give each active character a Special Ability Token.  
   - First Player: Players roll 5 dice clockwise until someone rolls 3-of-a-kind. Highest triplet wins; reroll ties.  

3. **First Turn**:  
   - First player reads “Seekers of Adventure” tile aloud.  
   - Begin Game Turn sequence.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn proceeds in 7 phases:  

1. **Roll Dice**: First player (Dice Keeper) rolls 5 dice.  
2. **Adjust Load Level (LL)**:  
   - Each player counts treasures (max 12). Wound & Supply cards count as 1 treasure each.  
   - Drop excess treasures if over 12.  
   - Determine LL:  
     - 0–3 treasures → LL = 2  
     - 4–6 → LL = 3  
     - 7–9 → LL = 4  
     - 10–12 → LL = 5  
   - Slide character card over game aid to show LL.  
3. **Assign Actions**:  
   - Each character gets 1 action for every die result ≥ their LL.  
   - Slide character card up to show number of actions available.  
4. **Perform Actions (clockwise from Dice Keeper)**:  
   - Each character performs actions in any order.  
   - Use Special Ability Token once (discard after use).  
   - Actions cost 1 unless specified.  
5. **Move Walls and Boulder**:  
   - **Walls**: Dice Keeper draws 3 Wall Cards.  
     - Orange arrow → move left wall (near Lava Room) 1 space inward.  
     - Grey arrow → move right wall 1 space inward.  
     - If walls meet, all in room are eliminated.  
   - **Boulder**: Roll dice = current round number (max 5).  
     - Move boulder 1 space per die ≥ 3.  
     - If boulder hits character, wall, or treasure, it moves 1 less space.  
     - When boulder passes corner near Sun Tile, remove Sun Tile — opens entrance for replacements.  
     - If boulder reaches exit, game ends.  
6. **Bring in Replacements**:  
   - If a character was eliminated and player has backup, place backup on open Sun Tile (A or B).  
   - Use original character’s card as game aid.  
   - Backup starts with no treasures.  
7. **Pass Dice**:  
   - Pass dice to character closest to exit.  
   - If tied, roll die or choose.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Load Level (LL)  
- Based on number of treasure cards (including Wound & Supply).  
- Max 12 treasures; must discard excess.  
- LL determines action count from dice roll.  

#### Actions by Area  

**Walls Room**  
- Move (1 action, orthogonal only).  
- Search: Draw top card from zone-matching deck. Can search same zone multiple times.  
- Decipher Glyph: Peek at glyph side of zone’s Glyph Clue Tile for 5 seconds. Reveals one trapped Lava Tile.  

**Boulder Corridor**  
- Move (1 action).  
- Open Lock (Alcove):  
  - Value 4 Treasure: roll at least one each of 1, 2, 3.  
  - Value 6 Treasure (Stone of Chac): roll 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  
  - Spend 1 extra action to reroll any dice.  
- Jump Pit:  
  - Roll dice = LL. Fail on any 1.  
  - Discard 3 treasures to reroll one 1 (once per 1).  
- Spider Web: Same as Pit. On fail: lose 1 treasure, end turn. Next turn: same test; fail on 1 → gain Wound.  
- Cross Bridge:  
  - Roll dice = number of planks.  
  - Each die < LL → remove 1 plank.  
  - Need ≥1 plank to cross.  
- Retrieve Golden Statue: Same as Cross Bridge. Success if ≥1 plank remains.  
- Stone of Chac Gained:  
  - Triggers Collapse Sealing: every turn before actions, all test like Pit.  
  - On 1: gain 1 Gravel Stone (marker) and 1 Wound.  
  - Continue until Stone exits temple.  
- Secret Tunnel:  
  - With Stone of Chac: spend 1 action to move directly to entrance.  
  - Without: open lock with 1 & 2.  
- Exchange Treasures: 1 action to swap non-Wound/Supply cards with adjacent character.  
- Pick Up Dropped Treasures: 1 action. Can only be done on safe spaces.  

**Lava Room**  
- First entry: remove masking card.  
- Move: Flip destination tile. If number matches one of the 4 brown numbers → trapped → eliminated.  
- Search: On safe tile, draw Lava Treasure, replace yellow tile with brown.  
- Sun Tiles: never trapped.  

**Underground River**  
- Always move 1 space extra after action (current).  
- Search: Draw River Treasure. Lay figure sideways. Must move before next search.  
- Exit River:  
  - Roll dice = LL.  
  - Fail on any 1.  
  - Discard 3 treasures per 1 to reroll (once).  
  - Fail → eliminated.  

**Wooden Bridge**  
- Move: Roll dice = planks. Each die < LL → plank breaks.  
- Sabotage: Spend 1 action to hop → retest bridge.  
- Multiple characters: total LL used.  

#### Special Abilities (use once, discard token)  
- **Sprint (Lea Rice, Martin Fletcher)**: Move 1 space without action (not in river).  
- **Stamina (Bill Baker, Mustafa Ibrahim)**: After LL adjustment, reduce LL by 1 for turn or discard 1 Supply.  
- **Linguistics (Prof. Griffith, Arely Tamay)**: In Lava Room, peek at adjacent glyph. Or peek at Wall Room clue if Lava Surprise active.  
- **Swimming (Puccio, Tatiana)**: Ignore one 1 when exiting river (self or adjacent).  
- **Lock Picking (Markus, Len Tso Yau)**: After lock roll, replace one die to succeed. Or remove Secret Door after unlock.  
- **Leap (Vincent, Nicole)**: Spend 1 action to move diagonally (not exit river). Or ignore one 1 when jumping pit/collapse.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game Ends When**:  
- Boulder reaches exit → seals temple → all inside eliminated.  
- No adventurers remain alive in temple.  

**Victory Conditions**:  
- **Standard Play**: Player with highest treasure value wins. Tie → shared victory.  
- **Cooperative Play**:  
  - Must have at least one survivor.  
  - Total extracted treasure value must meet minimum based on player count and complexity level:  

| Players | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 |  
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|  
| 1      | 10     | 15     | 20     | 25     |  
| 2      | 20     | 25     | 30     | 35     |  
| 3      | 30     | 35     | 40     | 45     |  
| 4      | 40     | 45     | 50     | 55     |  
| 5      | 50     | 55     | 60     | 65     |  
| 6      | 60     | 65     | 70     | 75     |  

**Scoring**:  
- Add values of all treasure cards.  
- Caskets (blank value): roll 1 die at game end → value = die result.  
- Wound cards have no value.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use special ability after action?** Yes, as long as timing is correct (e.g., Swimming after roll, Stamina after LL adjustment).  
- **Multiple characters on bridge?** Total LL used for test.  
- **Boulder hits dropped treasure?** Boulder moves 1 less space.  
- **Can I search same river space twice?** No, must move between searches.  
- **What if no Sun Tile is open for replacement?** Cannot bring in backup.  
- **Can I discard treasures during action phase?** Only during Load Level phase (Step 2), unless ability allows.  
- **Can I use Sprint to exit river?** No — Sprint cannot be used in river.  
- **Can I move diagonally?** Only with Leap ability.  
- **What if I roll all 1s exiting river?** Must discard 3 per 1 to reroll. If can’t or reroll fails → eliminated.
