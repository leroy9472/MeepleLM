# Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Sluff Off!*, players engage in a strategic trick-taking game where the goal is to minimize penalty points. Each round, players predict how many tricks of each color they will win and collect corresponding tokens. The core challenge lies in fulfilling these predictions by winning tricks and discarding the correct tokens. Alternatively, one player may take on the role of the *Sluffer*, aiming to disrupt others’ plans. The player with the fewest penalty points at the end of the game wins.

### 2. Components
- **75 Number Cards**: 15 cards (numbered 1–15) in each of five suits: Red, Blue, Green, Orange, and Purple.
- **27 Penalty Tokens**:
  - 5 Blue tokens (–2 points)
  - 3 Red, 3 Yellow, 3 Orange, 3 Purple tokens (all –2 points)
  - 6 Black tokens (–3 points)
  - 4 White tokens (–4 points, also act as wilds)
- **1 Sluffer Piece**: A special token that can be claimed by one player per round.
- **Scorepad or paper**: For tracking penalty points.

### 3. Setup
1. Place the Sluffer piece and all penalty tokens in the center of the table.
2. Determine which cards to use based on player count:
   - **3 players**: Use cards 1–9 in each suit (45 cards total)
   - **4 players**: Use cards 1–12 in each suit (60 cards total)
   - **5 players**: Use all 75 cards (1–15 in each suit)
3. Shuffle the selected cards and deal them evenly so each player receives 15 cards.
4. Players sort their hands by suit and number.
5. The player to the left of the dealer starts the first round.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of three distinct phases:

#### Phase 1: Prediction
Starting with the player to the left of the dealer and proceeding clockwise:
- Each player chooses one of two options:
  - **Make a Trick Prediction**: Predict how many tricks they will win in each color and take the corresponding colored tokens (e.g., 2 red, 1 blue). Players may take any number of tokens.
  - **Take the Sluffer**: One player may choose to take the Sluffer piece instead of making a prediction. Once taken, no other player may take it.
- Token availability:
  - If a desired color token is unavailable in the center, a player may take it from another player.
  - The player who loses their token receives a **white wild token** in return.
- White and black tokens cannot be taken during prediction.

#### Phase 2: Playing the Tricks
- The player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick by playing any card face up.
- Play proceeds clockwise. Each player must:
  - **Follow suit** if able (play a card of the same color as the lead card).
  - If unable to follow suit, may **"Sluff Off"** by playing any card, including a trump (Blue) card.
- **Trump Rules**:
  - Blue is always trump.
  - If no blue card is played, the highest card of the lead suit wins.
  - If one or more blue cards are played, the highest blue card wins, regardless of lead suit.
- The winner of the trick:
  - Collects all cards and places them in a face-down discard pile.
  - Immediately discards a corresponding token:
    - If the trick was **led with blue**, the winner **must** return a blue token.
    - If the trick was led with a non-trump color but won with blue, the winner may return **either** a blue token **or** a token of the lead suit.
    - For any trick, a **white token** may be used as a wild to fulfill the requirement.
  - If the player has **no matching token and no white token**, they must take a **black (–3) penalty token**.
  - If no black tokens remain in the center, the player is **not penalized**.
- The winner of each trick leads the next trick.

Special Rule for the **Sluffer**:
- The Sluffer can win tricks but **never discards tokens**.
- If the Sluffer wins a trick, they lead the next trick but do **not** take black penalty tokens for tricks they win.

#### Phase 3: Scoring the Round
After all 15 tricks are played:
- Players score penalty points based on tokens remaining in front of them:
  - **Red, Orange, Green, Blue, Purple tokens**: 2 points each
  - **Black tokens**: 3 points each
  - **White tokens**: 4 points each
  - **Players with no tokens**: 0 points
- **Sluffer Scoring**:
  - The Sluffer receives **4 penalty points**, reduced by **1 point per black token** taken by other players.
  - Minimum score: **0 points** (if opponents took 4 or more black tokens).
  - Example: If opponents took 3 black tokens, Sluffer receives 1 point (4 – 3 = 1).

All tokens and the Sluffer piece are returned to the center. The deal passes to the next player clockwise. A new round begins.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Trick Prediction**: Players commit to goals by taking tokens.
- **Token Management**: Players must discard tokens by winning matching tricks.
- **Trump Mechanic**: Blue cards override all other suits.
- **Wild Tokens**: White tokens can substitute for any color when discarding.
- **Disruption Role**: The Sluffer aims to force others into penalty tokens or failed predictions.
- **Limited Penalties**: Maximum of **6 black tokens** per round. If exhausted, players avoid penalties.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Play exactly **as many rounds as there are players** (e.g., 4 rounds with 4 players).
- After the final round, total all penalty points.
- The player with the **fewest penalty points wins**.
- **Tiebreaker**: Not specified; house rule may apply.

**3-Player Variant**:
- The Sluffer starts with **5 penalty points** (instead of 4), reduced by 1 point per black token taken by others (minimum 0).
