### 1. Lore & Objective
Axis & Allies is a strategic war game set during World War II, where players control major world powers. The Axis powers (Germany, Japan, Italy) challenge the Allies (Soviet Union, United Kingdom, United States). Victory can be achieved through control of Victory Cities, historical national objectives, or economic dominance.

**Victory Conditions:**
- **Victory City Victory:** Axis wins by controlling 45 Victory City Points (VCP); Allies win by controlling 55 VCP.
- **Historical Victory:** A player wins by achieving three of their randomly selected or chosen national historical objectives.
- **Economic Victory:** Teams bid for the number of rounds the game will last. The team controlling the majority of territory IPC value at the end wins.

### 3. Setup
- **Order of Play (Special Opening Round):**
  1. Soviet Union
  2. Axis
  3. Allies (including Soviet Union)

- No IPCs are collected during setup.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each player's turn follows this sequence:
1. **Collect Income**
2. **Purchase Units and Developments**
3. **Combat Move**
4. **Conduct Combat**
5. **Non-combat Move**
6. **Mobilize New Units**
7. **Develop Weapons**
8. **Diplomacy**

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Income & Economy
- **Collect Income:** Add up IPC values of controlled territories. Income can be reduced by:
  - Economic attacks (SBR, rocket strikes) from the previous turn.
  - Production interruption (territory attacked for 3+ combat cycles).
  - Lend-Lease: The US may send up to 12 IPCs to the Soviet Union and/or UK.
- **IPC Path:** IPCs must have a contiguous path (land or sea) from source to destination. Convoy sea zones can be attacked, destroying 1 IPC per successful roll (on 3 or less).

#### Turn Sequence
1. **Collect Income:** Gather IPCs based on controlled territories, adjusted for economic damage.
2. **Purchase Units and Developments:** Buy units and research technologies (5 IPC per research die).
3. **Combat Move:** Move units into hostile territories or sea zones. Air units are subject to AA fire when overflying hostile territories with AA guns.
4. **Conduct Combat:** Resolve battles in contested spaces.
5. **Non-combat Move:** Move non-combat units and perform reinforcements.
6. **Mobilize New Units:** Deploy purchased units at Industrial Complexes (ICs) or victory cities.
7. **Develop Weapons:** Apply researched technologies.
8. **Diplomacy:** Adjust cooperation levels with neutral nations.
