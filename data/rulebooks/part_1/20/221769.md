# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The basic aim of Bios: Megafauna is area control. Players compete to have the most creeples (representatives of life-forms) on the map at four critical moments—specifically, at the end of each era. Victory points are earned through map presence, mutualism, accumulated fossil tokens, and specific card effects. The player with the most victory points at the end of the final era wins.

## 2. Components
- **Map**: Composed of craton mini-boards (BALTICA, LAURENTIA, GONDWANA, SIBERIA), forming a line based on player count.
- **Creeples**: 7 per player per life-form shape (domes, snails, fish, insects, worms), representing archetypes and evolved forms.
- **Archetype Cards**: One per player; doubles as genotype card for starting life-form.
- **Mutation Cards**: 92 double-sided cards forming two decks:
  - Metabolic Mutation Deck: 24 yellow (circulatory) + 23 red (nervous)
  - Darwinian Mutation Deck: 23 green (digestive) + 22 blue (reproduction)
- **Mutation Display**: Two rows of 5 cards each (4 laid out + 1 on deck).
- **Event Cards**:
  - 15 extraterrestrial event cards (black-and-mauve backs)
  - (Not used in base game): 12 Goldilocks, 12 Too Cold, 12 Too Hot
- **Newborn Cards**: One per player; tracks newborn creeples.
- **TOOL Cards**: 4 shared cards (STICK, NET, DIVING BELL, STONE).
- **Small Wooden Cubes**: 110 cubes in red, yellow, green, blue, and white (organs).
- **Ammonite Tokens**: 16 victory point tokens.
- **Player Aid Cards**: 3 cards with "CONTESTS" and "MOVEMENT RULES" sides.
- **ERA Card**: Tracks current era (PALEOZOIC → MESOZOIC → CENOZOIC → QUATERNARY).
- **Dice**: 5 generic dice for mutagen events (color irrelevant).
- **Reservoir Board, Latitude Strips, Medea Card**: Not used in base game.

## 3. Setup
1. Place the ERA card showing ERA I PALEOZOIC.
2. Shuffle the 15 extraterrestrial event cards; deal 5 face down onto the ERA card. Set the remaining 10 aside.
3. Set aside unused event decks (Goldilocks, Too Cold, Too Hot).
4. Form two mutation decks:
   - Metabolic: Shuffle yellow and red cards; lay out top 4 + deck.
   - Darwinian: Shuffle green and blue cards; lay out top 4 + deck.
5. Each player selects a color and corresponding craton; place cratons in a line.
6. Place player’s archetype card in front, continental side up.
7. Place 6 domes (creeples) of player’s color on the archetype card (“unborn”).
8. Place the 7th dome on the craton hex marked for that color, below the white line (herbivore).
9. Place remaining creeples within reach.
10. Place newborn card next to archetype card, showing “NEWBORNS”.
11. Place 4 TOOL cards in shared area.
12. Place organ cubes and ammonite tokens in shared supply.
13. Place 5 dice in supply.
14. Place player aid cards in shared area.
15. Return unused components (reservoir board, latitude strips, Medea card, monster tokens) to the box.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of four phases:

### Phase 1: Events
- Reveal top extraterrestrial event card.
- Resolve events left to right, top to bottom.
- **Mutagen**: Replace 8 non-deck cards in mutation display. Roll dice (2 in Era I, 3 in Era II, etc.); highest die = “dark heart limit” (max organ count). Players reduce organs: basal over-limit → extinction; excess plus organs removed.
- **Radiation**: Choose to remove one red/yellow or green/blue plus organ per affected life-form. If mutation loses last plus organ and isn’t part of a personality, remove it.
- **Crowd Disease**: If a player has the most creeples on the map (including endangered), remove half (rounded down) to unborn.
- **Other**: No effect in base game.

### Phase 2: Actions
Each player takes 2 actions in turn order. Possible actions:
1. **Mutate**: Acquire one or more mutation cards. Cost = number of “unborn” creeples required (shown on newborn card table). Emotions reduce cost. Place corresponding plus organ(s) on card. Refill mutation display.
2. **Promote a Mutation**: Flip a mutation card to its promoted side. Move plus organs to genotype card (become basal). Choose one of two benefit sets. Place new plus organs. May trigger speciation, mutualism, emotion, or mutualism.
3. **Speciate**: Triggered when promoting a mutation that shows a creeple icon for a shape not yet in play.
   - Move mutation card to form new genotype.
   - Copy all basal organs from parent.
   - If new genotype has “recession” icon, discard one matching basal organ.
   - Place 6 new creeples on new genotype; place 7th on map in parent’s hex (replace one parent creeple).
4. **Populate**: Move 1 creeple from genotype to newborn card. If genotype has blue (reproduction) organs, move up to that many additional creeples.
5. **Neoteny**: Discard one or more basal organs from one or more life-forms. Does not cause extinction.
6. **Resurrect**: If no creeples on map, place archetype card, 6 domes on it, and 7th dome on any habitable hex as herbivore.

### Phase 3: Dispersal
For each creeple on a newborn card:
- Choose a starting creeple of same life-form on map (including endangered).
- Calculate dispersal points (DP) = 1 (base) + number of blue organs.
- Spend DP to move through adjacent hexes (costs per MOVEMENT RULES).
- May pass through but not settle in X-marked biomes.
- May raft between cratons: cost 1 DP for flyers/swimmers, 3 DP for others, plus entry cost.
- Place creeple in target hex, choosing herbivore (below line) or carnivore (above line).
  - Carnivore only allowed if herbivore niche is occupied by archetype or another player’s same-shape herbivore.
- If no legal settlement, return creeple to genotype.

### Phase 4a: Death
- Endangered creeples (on side) are resolved:
  - If herbivore and no other herbivore in hex → upright.
  - If carnivore and no other carnivore in hex → upright.
  - If herbivore sharing hex with archetype or same-shape creeple → may become carnivore (if niche open; else contest).
  - If has white organ → attempt dispersal to valid hex (player order).
- Any still endangered → return to genotype as unborn.
- Life-form with no creeples on map → extinct.

### Phase 4b: End of Era
- After 5th event card is resolved:
  - Flip ERA card to next era.
  - Shuffle all 15 extraterrestrial cards; deal 5 face down; set 10 aside.
  - **Scoring**: Count all creeples on map + host creeples from mutualism.
  - Earn 1 ammonite token for each player with fewer total than you.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Creeples**: Represent life-forms; once placed, do not move.
- **Organs**: Colored cubes (red, yellow, green, blue, white) grant abilities:
  - White: Enables survival dispersal when endangered.
  - Red/Yellow: Boost competitiveness in hexes with matching arrow.
  - Green: Boosts competitiveness in humid biomes (all in base game).
- **Mutations**:
  - Unpromoted: Grants plus organs.
  - Promoted: Grants additional benefits; chosen orientation determines effect.
- **Emotions & Personality**:
  - Formed by pairing head/tail emoticons of same color on promoted cards.
  - Single emotion: halves mutation cost of that color.
  - Two+ emotions: reduces all but leftmost card of that color to cost 1.
  - Personality sits atop tableau; only one per life-form.
- **Speciation**: Creates new life-form with inherited traits; may lead to competition.
- **Contests**:
  - Occur when multiple non-endangered herbivores or carnivores share a hex.
  - Resolve via priority list:
    - **Herbivores**:
      1. If carnivore present: venomous or larger herbivore wins.
      2. Fewer red/yellow organs (matching hex arrow) → lose.
      3. Fewer green organs → lose.
      4. Higher skeletal number → lose.
      5. Owner chooses loser.
    - **Carnivores**:
      1. Fewer red/yellow organs (matching hex arrow) → lose.
      2. Size more different from prey → lose.
      3. Smaller skeletal number → lose.
      4. Owner chooses loser.
  - Loser becomes endangered.
- **Extinction**: Occurs if life-form has no creeples on map or loses a basal organ during mutagen.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends after resolving 5th event card of Era IV (QUATERNARY).
- **Final Scoring**: 1 VP for each:
  - Creeple on map
  - Fossil token (ammonite)
  - Card with fossil icon (genotype, tool)
  - Host creeple on mutualism card
  - Emotion
- **Bonus**: 3 VP if life-form has “language” (personality with ≥3 emotions of ≥2 colors).
- Highest total VP wins.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I promote a mutation to speciate if the shape is already on the map?**  
  No. Speciation only allowed if the creeple shape is not already in play.
- **What happens if I speciate and the mother has no creeples on the map?**  
  The mother life-form goes extinct upon replacing one of its creeples (if none remain).
- **Can a carnivore occupy a hex without prey?**  
  No. Carnivores must have suitable prey (archetype or same-shape herbivore) or become endangered.
- **Do emotions persist if all cubes are lost from a mutation?**  
  Yes. Personality cards remain unless the life-form goes extinct.
- **Can I have multiple personalities?**  
  No. Each life-form can have only one personality.
