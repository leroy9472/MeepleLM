### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game alternates between **Stock Rounds** and **Operating Rounds**.

#### Stock Round  
Players take turns performing one action:  
- Pass  
- Buy one certificate (from IPO at par or Open Market at current price)  
- Sell any number of 10% shares (but not the same certificate just bought)  
- Buy then sell, or sell then buy (only one buy and one sell per turn)  

**Rules:**  
- Cannot sell a certificate in the same round it was bought  
- Open Market cannot hold >50% of any company  
- President’s certificate must be first sold if sold at all, and only if another player holds ≥2 shares  
- After first 6T purchase, Phase 5 begins → 3 ORs per Stock Round

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Phases  
Triggered by first purchase of a new train type:

| Phase | Trigger | Tile Lays | Train Limit | Private Purchase | ORs per SR | Off-Board Value |
|------|--------|-----------|-------------|------------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Before 3T | Yellow only | 4 trains | No | 1 | Top value |
| 2 | 3T bought | Yellow, Green | 4 trains | Yes | 2 | Top value |
| 3 | 4T bought | Yellow, Green | 3 trains | Yes | 2 | Top value |
| 4 | 5T bought | Yellow, Green, Brown | 2 trains | Privates close | 3 | Middle value |
| 5 | 6T bought | All tiles | 2 trains (CGR: 3) | — | 3 | Middle value |
| 6 | Diesel bought | All tiles | 2 trains (CGR: 3) | — | 3 | Bottom value |

**Rusting:**  
- 2T rusts when 4T bought  
- 3T rusts when 6T bought  
- 4T rustes when Diesel bought  

#### Private Company Powers  
- **Flos Tramway ($20):** No power  
- **Waterloo & Saugeen ($40):** Place tile (#59) and/or station in Kitchener instead of normal placement. Closes private.  
- **The Canada Company ($50):** Extra tile lay in its hex. Does not close private.  
- **Great Lakes Shipping ($70):** Place $20 port token in anchor city. Closes private. Removed when 6T bought.  
- **Niagara Falls Bridge ($100):** +$10 when running to Buffalo. Others may buy right for $50 (to owning corp or bank). CGR inherits if forming corp had it.  
- **St. Clair Tunnel ($100):** +$10 when running to Sarnia. Same rights rules as Bridge.  

**Purchasing Rights:**  
- After private closes, rights available from bank for $50  
- Once acquired, rights are permanent  
- CGR gains rights if any forming company had them  

#### Starting a Corporation  
- President buys first share (sets price: $65–$100)  
- **Before 5T available:**  
  - First 5 shares → incremental capitalization  
  - Remaining shares held in escrow until destination reached  
  - Destination reached when legal route exists (ignore other stations)  
- **At 5T phase:** Incremental capitalization (all money to treasury)  
- **At 6T or Diesel phase:** Full capitalization (10× par after 60% sold)  

**First Operation Requirement:**  
- Must have sold ≥ number of shares equal to current train type (e.g., 3 shares if 3T available)

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Formation of Canadian Government Railway (CGR)  
Triggered when **first 6T is bought**.

**Sequence:**  
1. Finish current OR  
2. Starting with president of 6T-buying corp, each president pays off loans:  
   - From corporate funds in $100 increments  
   - May use personal cash for remainder  
   - Cannot sell shares  
3. **If all loans repaid:** CGR does not form  
4. **If any company cannot repay:** CGR forms  

**CGR Formation Steps:**  
- **Share Exchange:**  
  - 2 shares of absorbed corp → 1 CGR share  
  - Players exchange in clockwise order  
  - Odd shares → Open Market (uncompensated)  
  - Open Market shares then exchanged 2:1  
  - If >10 CGR shares needed, issue second set (20 total)  
  - Excess unconverted shares removed  
- **President Determination:**  
  - First player with 2 CGR shares gets presidency  
  - After exchange: player with most CGR shares becomes president  
  - Tie: first among tied (clockwise from current holder)  
  - If no one has 2 shares: first to receive a share becomes interim president; must buy second in next SR  
- **Token Exchange:**  
  - All home stations converted to CGR stations  
  - Up to 10 total stations (including homes)  
  - President chooses order beyond homes; max one per tile  
- **Trains:**  
  - CGR keeps all permanent trains (5T, 6T, Diesel) up to 3-train limit  
  - Excess → Open Market  
  - If no permanent train: may borrow Diesel (not owned; doesn’t trigger phase change)  
  - Must withhold earnings until it can buy a permanent train  
  - Must buy Diesel when affordable, unless president buys 5T/6T instead  
- **Treasury:**  
  - CGR inherits all treasuries of absorbed companies  
  - No future IPO proceeds go to CGR  
- **Stock Value:**  
  - Starts at greater of $100 or average of absorbed corps (rounded down to nearest $5)  
  - If ≥3 companies absorbed, ignore lowest value  
  - If 20 shares issued, token = $5% value; else = $10% value  
- **Operation:**  
  - If any forming corp already operated → CGR skips this OR  
  - Else → CGR operates immediately (out of turn)  
  - Subsequent ORs: normal order  

**CGR Rules (Ongoing):**  
- Only buys/sells trains at printed price  
- Only buys 5T, 6T, Diesel  
- Stock price does not move into "Closed" section  
- May operate with borrowed Diesel but must earn to buy one  

#### End Game Triggers  
Game ends immediately when any of:  
- Bank runs out of money  
- A player goes bankrupt (cannot cover forced payment)  
- Stock market reaches end (rightmost space)  
- Final train purchased (Diesel)  
- Set number of ORs completed (varies by player count)  

#### Final Scoring  
- Cash on hand  
- Stock value: current market price per share  
- **Penalty:** $10 per outstanding loan per share owned  
  - E.g., if company has 2 loans and you own 2 shares → $40 penalty  

Highest total wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can a company lay a tile not connected to its network?**  
A: Only via private company power (e.g., Canada Company, Waterloo & Saugeen).  

**Q: Can I sell a share and buy another of the same company in the same SR?**  
A: No. Once you sell a share of a company, you cannot buy any share of that company in the same SR.  

**Q: What happens if CGR forms but has no trains?**  
A: It may borrow a Diesel to operate. It must withhold earnings until it can buy a permanent train.  

**Q: Can a company buy a train from another company at below market value?**  
A: Yes, if both presidents agree. Minimum $1.  

**Q: Does CGR stock move during share sales?**  
A: No. CGR stock does not move until it owns a permanent train.  

**Q: Can I decline to place a station marker during tile lay?**  
A: Yes, placement is optional.  

**Q: What happens to private company income after it closes?**  
A: It no longer pays income.  

**Q: Can a company operate with no trains?**  
A: Only if it has no legal route. If it has a route, it must own a train.  

**Q: Can CGR buy a 4T?**  
A: No. CGR only buys 5T, 6T, or Diesel.  

**Q: Do off-board values change during the game?**  
A: Yes. Use top value pre-5T; middle value at 5T and 6T; bottom value when Diesel available.
