## Jungle Speed — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The objective of Jungle Speed is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards, including your final face-up card. Victory requires both emptying your deck and discarding your last played card.

2. Components  
- 80-card deck featuring various symbols in 4 colors  
- 1 wooden totem (placed in the center of the table)  

3. Setup  
- Place the totem in the center of the table.  
- Shuffle the deck and deal all 80 cards evenly among players.  
  - Players do not look at their cards.  
  - Any leftover cards (if player count doesn’t divide evenly) are placed face down under the totem.  
- All players must play using only one hand.  
- Cards must be turned over outward—toward other players—so symbols are clearly visible.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows these steps in clockwise order unless modified by special cards:  
1. **Turn Over a Card**: On their turn, a player flips the top card of their deck face-up onto their discard pile.  
2. **Check for Triggers**:  
   - If two or more players have matching symbols (regardless of color), a duel begins.  
   - If a special arrow card is revealed, its effect immediately takes precedence.  
3. **Resolve Duel or Special Effect**:  
   - Duel: First player to grab the totem wins.  
   - Special card: Apply its rule immediately.  
4. **Continue Play**: The loser of a duel starts the next round by flipping the next card.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Duels (Matching Symbols)**:  
  - Triggered when two players reveal cards with identical symbols (color does not matter).  
  - Both players race to grab the totem.  
  - Winner: Keeps their discard pile.  
  - Loser: Takes all of winner’s face-up cards, their own face-up cards, and any cards under the totem. These are placed face-down under their deck.  
  - The loser begins the next round.  

- **Special Arrow Cards**:  
  - **ALL FLIP (arrows pointing outward)**:  
    - All players simultaneously flip a card.  
    - If no duel occurs, the player who played the ALL FLIP card continues the next turn.  
    - If multiple ALL FLIP cards appear consecutively with no valid duels, effect repeats.  
  - **FAST GRAB (arrows pointing inward)**:  
    - All players immediately try to grab the totem.  
    - Winner places all their face-up cards under the totem and starts the next round.  
  - **COLOR MATCH (arrows in different colors)**:  
    - Only active with 4 or more players.  
    - Duels are triggered by matching **colors**, not symbols.  
    - The player who played the COLOR MATCH card sits out this round.  
    - Multi-player duels allowed: Winner chooses how to distribute their cards—give all to one loser or split among multiple losers.  
    - Effect ends when:  
      a) the totem is grabbed,  
      b) another special arrow card is flipped, or  
      c) a duel occurs.  
    - While active, symbol-matching duels are suspended.

- **Penalties (Mistakes)**:  
  - Any player who grabs the totem when not allowed (e.g., no duel triggered, wrong turn, or drops it) must take all face-up cards on the table, including those under the totem.  
  - Play resumes with the penalized player starting the next round.

- **Edge Cases with Special Cards**:  
  - If two ALL FLIP cards appear consecutively and no duel is possible, the effect repeats—everyone flips again.  
  - If a duel and a special arrow card are triggered simultaneously, the faster action takes precedence (e.g., if the duel resolves first, it proceeds; if a player grabs the totem for an arrow card first, that effect applies).  
  - If multiple duels are possible at once (e.g., three players have same symbol), the first to grab the totem wins. The second duel is void.  
  - In 3+ player duels (e.g., via COLOR MATCH), winner decides card distribution.  
  - If a player’s last card is:  
    - FAST GRAB: If they lose the grab, they take all cards and continue.  
    - ALL FLIP: They place their last card under the totem and win.  
    - COLOR MATCH: They must collect all face-up cards and continue playing.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when a player successfully gets rid of all their cards, **including the last face-up card**.  
- After a player flips their final card, they do not win immediately.  
- Play continues until that final card is removed via:  
  - Winning a duel,  
  - Triggering a special card effect that removes it, or  
  - Another player causing them to take more cards.  
- The first player to have no cards in hand and no face-up card wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you use both hands?** No. Only one hand may be used at all times.  
- **What if I flip a card incorrectly (inward)?** Reposition it outward immediately; no penalty unless it causes confusion.  
- **Do colors ever matter?** Only during COLOR MATCH card effects or when specified. Otherwise, only symbols matter.  
- **What happens if the totem is knocked over without a duel?** The player responsible takes all face-up cards.  
- **Can you win on a special card?**  
  - Yes, if it’s an ALL FLIP card: placing the last card under the totem = win.  
  - No, if it’s FAST GRAB or COLOR MATCH: player must survive the effect and have no cards afterward.
