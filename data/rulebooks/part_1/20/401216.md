## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The kingdom is fractured, and towns are isolated. Players take on the roles of ministers appointed by El Cascadero to restore unity by sending envoys to towns, building connections, and advancing on Success Tracks. The goal is to qualify for victory by reaching the top of your color-matched Success Track and having the most Victory Points (VP), or, if no one qualifies, to have the most VP for a minor victory.

### 2. Components  
- 1 double-sided main board (Basic / Farmer)  
- 4 Heralsds (neutral markers)  
- 12 Seals  
- 4 sets of player materials in 4 colors:  
  - 30 Envoys per player  
  - 5 Cubes per player (1 per Success Track)  
  - 12 Flags per player  
  - 1 Shield per player (for VP tracking)  
- 1 First Player marker  
- 24 Farmer tiles (used only with Farmer board)  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the main board in the center, Basic side up (or Farmer side for Farmer variant).  
2. Place 1 Herald on each of the 4 towns with a ★ icon (or agreed variant icons: ● or ×).  
3. On each Success Track:  
   - Place 1 Seal on each folded (darker) space.  
   - Place each player’s cube at the bottom of each track.  
4. Each player:  
   - Chooses a color.  
   - Takes 30 Envoys, 12 Flags, and places their Shield at 0 VP.  
   - Places 1 cube on the starting space of each of the 5 Success Tracks.  
5. Randomly select the first player and give them the First Player marker.  

*Farmer Variant Setup:*  
- Shuffle 24 Farmer tiles and place one face-up on each farmer field.  
- These tiles are locked until unlocked (see Farmer rules).  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, follow these steps:  
1. **Place 1 Envoy** on any empty field (not a town).  
2. **Check for Town Scoring** – if triggered, resolve scoring.  
3. **Resolve Cascading Actions** – if scoring advanced your cube, trigger actions in order.  
4. **Check for Achievements** – claim any newly completed achievements.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Group  
- 2 or more envoys of the same color connected via adjacent fields.  
- Single envoys are not a group.  

#### Town Scoring (Trigger Conditions)  
Scoring is triggered when you place an envoy adjacent to a town **if**:  
- The placed envoy is part of a **group**, **and**  
- This group has **not previously been in contact** with that town.  
**OR**  
- The placed envoy is **single** but you place a **Seal** underneath it (“Upgraded” envoy).  

*Note:* Only the town adjacent to the placed envoy is eligible for scoring.  

#### Scoring Progress on Success Tracks  
Advance your cube on the track matching the town’s color:  
- **1 space**: If your envoy is the **first ever** adjacent to the town.  
- **2 spaces**: If other envoys are already adjacent.  
- **+1 additional space**: If the town has a Herald.  
  - So: 2 total (1+1) for first contact with Herald, or 3 total (2+1) for later contact with Herald.  

#### Forbidden Spaces (X spaces)  
- Your cube **cannot stop** on a space marked with an X.  
- If a 1-space advance would land on X, you **stay on the space below**.  
- To pass over X, you must advance **2 or 3 spaces** in a single scoring (i.e., jump over it).  
- The action on the space below X is triggered only the **first time** you reach it.  

#### Cascading Actions  
When your cube advances and **lands on or passes through** a space with an action:  
- Trigger actions **in order** (bottom to top).  
- **Exception – Folded Spaces**: Action only triggers if you **stop** on the space.  

##### Action Types  
- **Victory Points (Shield icon)**: Gain VP shown.  
  - If two numbers: 1st player to reach gets higher, others get lower.  
- **Advance a Cube**: Move any one of your cubes up 1 space. May trigger further actions.  
- **Place an Envoy**: Take an extra turn after resolving all actions.  
  - Always perform this action **last**, even if triggered earlier.  
- **Take a Seal**: If you are the **first** to stop on a folded space with a seal, take it.  
  - Cannot take if you pass over it (e.g., advance 2+ spaces).  
- **Move an Envoy**: If the seal on a folded space has been taken, stopping there lets you move one of your envoys to an adjacent empty field (with its seal, if present).  
  - Does **not** trigger town scoring.  
  - Cannot trigger if you pass over the space.  

#### Seals  
- Can be placed under a **single envoy** to "upgrade" it and trigger town scoring.  
- Seals in front of you (unspent) count toward achievements.  
- Seals under envoys **do not count**.  

#### Farmer Variant (Farmer Board)  
- Farmer tiles are special fields with actions.  
- **Locked** at start: You must have an envoy adjacent to a Farmer tile to unlock it for yourself.  
- Once unlocked, you may place an envoy on it (or move onto it).  
- Placing or moving an envoy onto a Farmer tile triggers its action:  
  - Score 2 or 3 VP  
  - Advance a cube 1 space  
  - Take another turn (Place an Envoy)  
  - Move a Herald to any town without a Herald and with empty adjacent fields  
- You may reactivate a Farmer tile by leaving and returning.  
- **Move an Envoy action** allows moving onto an adjacent Farmer tile, even if no longer adjacent afterward.  

#### Achievements  
Players claim achievements by placing a Flag on the achievement space when criteria are met.  

##### First-to-Claim (3 VP each, only one player)  
- All 5 of your cubes reach the first achievement banner.  
- You have 3 unspent Seals.  
- 3 of your cubes reach the second achievement banner.  
- One of your groups connects towns of all 5 colors.  
- One of your cubes reaches the third achievement banner.  
- One of your groups connects 3 towns of the same color.  

##### Individual (2 VP each, all players may claim once per color)  
- One of your groups connects 2 towns of the same color. (One per color.)  
- **Bonus (10 VP)**: Claim all 5 color achievements.  

*Note:* A single achievement (e.g., "2 yellow towns") can only be claimed once per player.  

#### Advanced Variant (Herald Movement)  
- Use only 2 Heralsds, placed on the two central white (Education) towns.  
- When you score in a town with a Herald:  
  - Move the Herald to any neighboring town (exactly 3 fields away),  
  - That has empty adjacent fields,  
  - And does not already contain a Herald.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End  
The game ends **immediately** at the end of a turn if:  
- Any player reaches **50 or more VP**, **or**  
- A player has **no Envoys left** at the start of their turn.  

#### Victory Conditions  
- **Qualify**: Only players whose cube has reached the **top (third banner)** of their **own color’s Success Track** qualify for major victory.  
- **Winner**: Among qualified players, the one with the **most VP** wins.  
- **Minor Victory**: If **no player qualifies**, the player with the **most VP** wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: The tied player who took their turn **latest in the first round** wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I score the same town multiple times?**  
  Yes, with **different groups** (must not have previously contacted that town).  

- **Does moving an envoy trigger scoring?**  
  No. Moving an envoy (via Move an Envoy action or Farmer tile) **never triggers scoring**.  

- **Can I use Place an Envoy action to place on a locked Farmer tile?**  
  No. You must first unlock it by placing an envoy adjacent.  

- **Can I trigger Move an Envoy action by passing over a folded space?**  
  No. You must **stop** on the folded space, and the seal must already be taken.  

- **What if I advance 2 spaces and pass over a folded space with a seal?**  
  You **do not** take the seal. Only stopping grants the action.  

- **Can I claim the 10 VP bonus after claiming the 5th color?**  
  Yes, immediately upon claiming the fifth 2-town achievement.  

- **Can a group score multiple towns in one turn?**  
  No. Only the town **adjacent to the placed envoy** is eligible.
