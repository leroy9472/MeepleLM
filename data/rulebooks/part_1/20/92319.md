## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Olympos is a strategic civilization-building game where players expand their influence across ancient lands, develop technologies and wonders, and earn prestige through exploration, discovery, and divine favor. The goal is to amass the most Prestige Points by the end of the game through territory control, advancements, and fulfilling objectives.

2. Components  
- Development Board (with columns for Discoveries and Wonders)  
- Development Tiles: Red (Agriculture, Money, etc.), Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple (Discovery types), and Wonder tiles  
- Resource cubes and tokens (representing food, materials, etc.)  
- Settlers (player pieces)  
- Territory tokens (to block or mark regions)  
- Destiny Cards and Olympos Cards (including Keres)  
- Prestige Tokens (1 and 5 points)  
- Hourglass tokens  
- Tribe and Barbarian markers  
- Time Track with Zeus/Dual Zeus spaces  
- Scoring Track  

3. Setup  
- **Development Tiles**:  
  - Use tiles marked for player count (3/3/4/5 for 2/3/4/5 players); discard unused.  
  - For 2 players: discard all duplicate tiles except Agriculture and Money (both kept as stacks).  
  - Sort tiles by type (front image), randomly place stacks matching colors on Development Board.  
  - 2-player variant: do not use the 5th column; discard any tiles assigned to it.  

- **Player Pieces**:  
  - Each player takes 4 Settlers into personal supply.  
  - 1 Settler per player is randomly stacked on the starting space.  
  - Last player in stack order receives territory tokens:  
    - 5P: 1 per type (4 total)  
    - 4P: 2 per type (8 total)  
    - 3P: 3 per type (12 total)  
    - 2P: 3 per type (12 total, as in 4P rules)  
  - Flip tokens to 'X' side; block same-type territories.  
  - Never block both star-marked spaces of the same type.  
  - Place Tribe token (0 Sword strength) on remaining star-marked spaces.  
  - 2P: Add 4 "Barbarian" Settlers (unused color) on 4 empty territories, each producing different resources. Barbarians have 1 Sword strength. They are never permanently defeated—return if player leaves.  

- **Cards**:  
  - Shuffle Destiny and Olympos decks separately.  
  - (Optional) Place Olympos cards at Zeus/Double Zeus spaces on Time Track.  

- **Resources**:  
  - Each player receives 1 random resource cube (no duplicates; 5P allows one duplicate).  
  - 2P: each player gets a different random cube at start.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns performing one action per turn until all pass or take a final action. Turn order follows the starting stack; after first turn, play proceeds clockwise.

Each turn consists of:
1. Choose one action: Expansion or Development (7 AP available).
2. Spend Action Points (AP) to perform sub-actions.
3. Move Settler on Time Track based on total AP spent (use Hourglass tokens first, unless just received).
4. Trigger Zeus effects if landing on or passing Zeus/Double Zeus spaces.
5. Game ends when all players have either passed or taken a final action after passing Final Zeus.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Action Option 1: Expansion (up to 7 AP)**  
- Place new Settler:  
  - In northern zone or on existing territory = 2 AP  
- Movement:  
  - Land space (white/yellow border) = 1 AP per space  
  - Sea space = 2 AP per space  
  - Movement can pass through occupied or blocked spaces.  
- Conquer empty land: end movement on empty land space → claim its resource token.  

**Combat**:  
- Cost: 1 AP if more Swords, 2 AP if equal Swords, 3 AP if fewer Swords.  
- Attacking Settler placed on top of defender.  
- Defender transfers territory’s resource token to attacker.  
- Defender gains 1 Hourglass token.  
- Tribes (0 Sword): conquer via combat (costs 1 AP), take Star token.  
- Barbarians (1 Sword): same combat rules; if player leaves, Barbarian reclaims territory.  

**Flee**:  
- Move a conquered Settler (pay normal movement AP).  

**Action Option 2: Development (7 AP required)**  
- Choose: Make one Discovery or build one Wonder.  

**Discovery**:  
- Spend required resource **cubes** (tokens not spent).  
- Take tile; resolve special effect.  
- Place Settler from general supply on bonus space (third bonus space only used in 5P).  
- 2P: if second Agriculture or Money is purchased, discard it after effect.  

**Wonder**:  
- Spend required number of **Star cards** (tokens not spent).  
- Player’s Settlers in the Wonder’s column count as stars.  
- Architecture and Engineering Discoveries each count as 1 star.  

**End of Action**  
- Total AP spent determines movement on Time Track (use Hourglass tokens first, unless received this turn).  
- Landing on Zeus space:  
  - Draw Destiny card.  
  - First player to land draws first Zeus card; last to land draws second (if any).  
  - Good Zeus cards affect players with most Zeus symbols (non-zero).  
  - Bad Zeus cards affect players with fewest Zeus symbols (including zero).  
- Passing Final Zeus space:  
  - On next turn, player may take one final action or pass.  
- Game ends when all players have passed or completed final action.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Final scoring occurs after last player completes final action.

Points are awarded for:  
- **Time Track Position**: 0–5 points (based on final spot)  
- **Prestige Tokens**: 1 or 5 points each  
- **Territories**:  
  - Regular: 1 point each  
  - Atlantis: 2 points each  
- **Discovery Tiles**: 2 points each  
- **Wonder Tiles**: 8, 10, or 12 points (based on tile)  
- **Oikoumene Objective Tiles**: 3 points each  
- **Unused Destiny Cards**: 1 point per card  
- **Keres Olympos Card**: −2 points (if held)  

Total all categories; highest score wins. Tiebreaker: most territories.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Barbarian Territories**: Can be re-conquered repeatedly. Always return if vacated.  
- **Zeus Card Timing**: Drawn when landing on Zeus space, not when passing.  
- **Final Zeus**: Only triggers "final action" option when **passed**, not landed on.  
- **Resource Spending**: Discovery uses cubes (consumed); Wonder uses Star cards (discarded).  
- **2P Development Setup**: Only one tile per type placed, except Agriculture and Money (stacked). When bought, choose one of the two.  
- **Hourglass Use**: Used first when moving on Time Track, unless received during same action.  
- **Tribes**: Defeating Tribe (0 Sword) gives Star token and follows normal combat rules.
