## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In The Great Split, players are elite collectors attending a high-stakes gala, competing to build the most prestigious collection of riches. The goal is to earn the most Prestige points through strategic card management, resource collection, and scoring opportunities across six rounds. Players must balance immediate gains with long-term contracts and seals, while navigating dynamic neighbor interactions during the split-and-choose mechanic.

5. Each player takes the Wallet and Splitter card matching their board’s color.  
6. Shuffle Character tiles and deal 1 to each player; return extras to box.  
7. For each Resource icon on the Character tile’s top left, advance 1 space on that Resource Track. Note any Contract icons at the bottom for endgame scoring.

13. Deal 4 Level I cards to each player; return unused Level I cards to box.

15. Choose a Host to manage card dealing and game flow.

For 2 players (additional rules):  
- After dealing 4 Level I cards, leave remaining Level I cards face-down next to decks.  
- During Deal phase, Host deals 1 card from current Level and 1 from previous Level (e.g., Level III and Level II).

4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of 6 rounds. Each round has 5 phases:  
1. Deal  
2. Split  
3. Resolution  
4. Market  
5. End of Round  

5. Core Mechanics  

- Deal Phase:  
  - Host deals 1 Resource card from the deck corresponding to the current round’s Level (shown on Central board).  
  - In 2-player games, deal 1 from current Level and 1 from previous Level.  
  - Check hand size limit (shown on Central board). Discard down to limit if exceeded. Discard pile goes next to trash icon.  

- Split Phase (simultaneous actions):  
  1. Create a Split: Divide your hand (excluding Splitter card) into two groups, using your Splitter card as a divider. Insert both groups into your Wallet.  
  2. Offer your Split: Pass your Wallet to the player on your left. Receive a Wallet from the player on your right.  
  3. Make your choice: Open received Wallet. Choose one group to keep; return the other group and the Splitter card to the Wallet.  
  4. Return the Wallet: Pass the Wallet back to its owner. Combine your kept cards with the cards returned to you by the player on your left. This forms your active hand for Resolution.  

- Resolution Phase (simultaneous):  
  - Play all Resource cards and your Splitter card one by one.  
  - For each Resource card:  
    - Advance on tracks based on central or corner icons (Tomes, Artwork, Topazes, Emeralds, Gold, Prestige).  
    - Seal icons:  
      - Diamond Seals: advance 1 space on any left-side Seal Track.  
      - Square Seals: advance 1 space on any right-side Seal Track.  
      - Star Seals: advance 1 space on any Seal Track.  
      - Multiple Seal icons can go on same or different tracks.  
  - Splitter card: grants 1 free advancement on any track (including Seal Tracks).  
  - Selling cards: At any time, play a card face down to gain 1 advancement on either Prestige or Gold Track (not both). Card remains in hand for next round.  
  - Special Spaces (triggered when you reach or pass them):  
    - Gold Track (→ Double Arrow): immediately advance 2 spaces on any single track (not Gold).  
    - Seal Tracks (Resource icon): immediately advance 1 space on corresponding Resource Track.  
    - Scoring Spaces (bordered): no immediate effect, but contribute to Tome, Contract, or Contract Scoring (see below).  

- Market Phase:  
  - Host reveals Market token under current Round space.  
  - Advance Market slider by the token’s value (0–4).  
  - The slider’s arrow shows cumulative Art Market value (sum of revealed tokens).  
  - Minimum final value: 8; maximum: 16.  

- End of Round:  
  - Host advances Round marker.  
  - Outcomes:  
    - No Scoring line crossed: take back all played and sold cards into hand. Start new round.  
    - Scoring line crossed: trigger mid-game Scoring(s) (see below) before continuing.  
    - Final space reached: game ends. Proceed to End of Game.  
  - Mid-game Scorings occur after Round 3 and Round 4.  
  - Check the two Scoring tokens on the crossed line:  
    - 3 types: Tome, Artwork, Gem  
    - 1 type: "No Scoring"  
    - One mid-game Scoring triggers two types; the other triggers one.  

6. Scoring & End Game  

- Tome Scoring:  
  - Find the highest Prestige banner reached or passed on your Tome Track.  
  - Gain Prestige points equal to that value.  

- Artwork Scoring:  
  - Compare your Artwork Track level with the Market slider position.  
  - Prestige rewards:  
    - 0–2 Artwork: 0 points  
    - 3–5 Artwork: 6 points  
    - 6 Artwork: 10 points  
    - 7–9 Artwork: 13 points  
    - 10+ Artwork: 15 points  

- Gem Scoring:  
  - Identify your least advanced Gem Track (Topaz or Emerald).  
  - Gain Prestige points = 2 × value of that track.  
  - If tied, score only one (e.g., both at 7 → 14 points).  

- Contract Scoring (endgame only):  
  - For each Resource (Tomes, Artwork, Topazes, Emeralds, Gold):  
    1. Count Contract icons on that Resource Track (reached or passed).  
    2. Add any matching Contract icons from your Character tile.  
    3. Prestige value per Contract = number of ★ icons in the rightmost banner reached or passed on the corresponding Seal Track.  
    4. Total = sum of (Contract count × ★ value) for all Resources.  
  - If Seal Track level is 0, Contracts are worth 0.  

- Final Scoring:  
  - All four Scorings (Tome, Artwork, Gem, Contract) occur at the end of Round 6.  
  - Player with highest total Prestige wins.  
  - Tie: shared victory.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I discard cards even if under hand limit?  
  A: No. Discarding only occurs if hand exceeds limit after Deal.  
- Q: Can I sell a card for Prestige if Prestige Track is maxed?  
  A: Yes. If you exceed 99, advance on +100 Track (e.g., 100, 200, etc.).  
- Q: Can I use Splitter card to advance on a maxed track?  
  A: No. Advancements must be placed on tracks that can still progress.  
- Q: Do sold cards count toward hand size?  
  A: Yes. Sold cards remain in hand and count toward hand limit.  
- Q: Can I split my hand unevenly?  
  A: Yes. Groups can have different numbers of cards.  
- Q: What if I max a Seal Track with a special space that gives an instant Resource advancement?  
  A: You still gain the instant advancement, provided the target Resource Track is not maxed.
