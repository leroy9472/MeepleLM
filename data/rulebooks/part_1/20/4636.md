## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The objective of *Clans* is to score the most points on the scoring track by the time the 12th village is established. Players represent rival clans moving huts across a shared landscape, seeking to isolate villages and claim bonus chips and scoring opportunities.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with 12 regions, each divided into 5 territories  
- 60 huts (12 sets of 5, each set in one of 5 colors)  
- 5 scoring discs (one per color)  
- Square cards (one per player, indicating secret color)  
- Round bonus chips (12 total, placed on the scoring track)  

### 3. Setup  
1. Divide the 60 huts into 12 sets of 5, with each set containing one hut of each of the 5 colors.  
2. Place each set of 5 huts onto one of the 12 board regions. In each region, place one hut in each of the 5 territories.  
3. Shuffle the square cards (each showing a color) and deal one to each player. This is their secret color.  
4. Place one bonus chip on each of the 12 round spaces inside the scoring track.  
5. Place the 5 scoring discs at the starting position (bottom) of the scoring track.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order. Each turn consists of three phases:  

#### 1) Move Huts  
- A player must move every hut from one populated territory to an adjacent populated territory.  
- A territory is "populated" if it contains at least one hut.  
- You may not move huts from a territory that contains 7 or more huts, **unless** two such territories (with ≥7 huts) are adjacent. In that case, you may move the smaller group into the larger one.  
- If no legal move is possible, proceed immediately to Final Scoring.  

#### 2) Isolate Villages  
- After the move, if any populated territory no longer borders any other populated territory, it is isolated — a village is formed.  
- If multiple villages are isolated in a single turn, the active player chooses the order in which they are processed.  
- For each isolated village:  
  - Take the next bonus chip from the top of the scoring track.  
  - Score the village (see below).  

#### 3) Scoring a Village  
- **Terrain Check (Right):** Look at the terrain symbol to the **right** of the taken bonus chip. If the village was formed in a territory with that terrain, remove all huts from the board and score **nothing**.  
- **Full-Color Check:** If the village contains huts of all 5 colors, remove any huts that are the only one of their color (uniquely-colored).  
- **Base Score:** Count the number of remaining huts in the village.  
- **Bonus Check (Left):** Look at the terrain symbol to the **left** of the taken bonus chip. If the village was formed in that terrain, add the bonus number shown.  
  - **Exception:** If this was the **last** bonus chip taken, apply the bonus **regardless** of terrain.  
- For each color with at least one hut remaining in the village, move the corresponding scoring disc forward by the total number of huts (including bonus).  
- If the last bonus chip was taken during this scoring, proceed immediately to Final Scoring.  
- No additional villages are scored, even if multiple were isolated this turn.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- Movement is mandatory if possible: move all huts from one populated territory to an adjacent populated one.  
- Isolation triggers scoring: a territory becomes a village if it has no adjacent populated territories.  
- Bonus chips drive scoring: each provides terrain checks and a scoring opportunity.  
- Scoring is per color: each color present in a village advances its disc by the total score.  
- The game ends when the 12th bonus chip is taken or no legal move exists.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Final Scoring  
- All players reveal their secret color.  
- Remove all scoring discs **except** those matching a player’s secret color.  
- Each player gains **one additional point** on the scoring track for each bonus chip they collected during the game.  
- The player with the highest score wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I isolate more than one village per turn?**  
  Yes. If your move isolates multiple villages, you resolve them one at a time, choosing the order.  
- **What happens if I take the last bonus chip mid-turn?**  
  Score the current village, then proceed to Final Scoring. Do not score any further villages, even if isolated.  
- **Can I move into a territory with 7+ huts?**  
  Yes, as long as you are not moving **from** a territory with 7+ huts (unless both are ≥7 and adjacent).  
- **What if no legal move exists?**  
  The game ends immediately; proceed to Final Scoring.  
- **Are huts removed after every village scoring?**  
  Only if the "right terrain" condition is met or after full-color cleanup. Otherwise, huts remain for future moves.
