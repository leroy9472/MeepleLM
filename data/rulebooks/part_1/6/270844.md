### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of 4 phases, played clockwise from First Player:

- For each card you keep, spend 1 Worker (place on Clan Tile).  
- Discard unkept cards to your discard pile.  
- Retrieve original hand.  
- Resolve Storage effects (if applicable).  

#### 2) Action Phase  
Players take turns performing one of the following actions or passing:  
- Use a Clan Action Pawn  
- Build a Location  
- Raid an Opponent  
- Use an Action from a Location  

Once a player passes, they cannot act or be targeted for the rest of the phase.  

#### 3) Expedition Phase  
For each Ship a player has on the Expedition Board (in queue order):  
- Choose 1 Island Card (faceup or top of deck).  
- Perform Pillage or Raze action based on Ship loadout.  
- Return Ship to supply; discard Fish and/or Raze Tokens used.  

#### 4) Cleanup Phase  
- Return all Workers from Clan Tile to supply.  
- Unexhaust all cards in Empire.  
- Return all Clan Action Pawns to supply.  
- Discard faceup Island Cards; reveal 2 new from each deck.  
- Pass First Player Marker clockwise.  
- If no one reached 25 VP in Action Phase, begin new round.  
- If someone reached 25 VP in Expedition Phase, next round is final.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions  
Each turn, a player may perform one of:  

**Use a Clan Action Pawn**  
Place an unexhausted Clan Action Pawn on any Action Tile (blank-side up) and perform the action:  
- **Explore**: Draw 1 card.  
- **Populate**: Gain 1 Worker.  
- **Construct**: Build 1 non-Field Location for free.  
- **Harvest**: Gain Goods from 1 Field (including upgrades).  
- **Sail**: Place 1 Ship on Expedition Board; optionally assign 1 Fish and/or 1 Raze Token.  

A Clan Action Pawn may be used twice:  
- First use: Place on tile (free).  
- Second use: Spend 1 Food to move it to an adjacent tile and activate; flip to exhausted side.  

**Build a Location**  
1. Choose Location Card from hand.  
2. Pay cost (Resources or Action).  
3. Place in Empire.  
- Fields require declaring their matching Action (e.g., Harvest to build a Field).  
- Upgrades attach under matching Field; gain only upgrade Goods.  
- Instant Cards resolve and discard.  
- Action Cards are rotated when used.  
- Building Bonus: One-time effect when built.  

**Raid an Opponent**  
1. Discard 1 Raze Token.  
2. Exhaust an opponent’s unexhausted Action Card.  
- Cannot target passed players.  

**Use an Action from a Location**  
1. Choose unexhausted Action Card.  
2. Pay any cost (Goods or Workers).  
3. Resolve effect.  
4. Exhaust card.  

#### Boost Cards & Field Building  
- When an Action is declared (tile or card), before resolving it, you may play **one** Boost Card or build **one** Field Card that matches the declared Action.  
- Must resolve the declared Action even if used only for Boost/Field.  

#### Expedition Phase Actions  
- **Pillage**: Gain Goods shown on Island Card; discard Island.  
- **Raze (Conquer)**: Take Island Card into Empire; gain Building Bonus.  
- Ship loadout determines options:  
  - No Fish, No Raze: Pillage Nearby only.  
  - Fish, No Raze: Pillage Nearby or Distant.  
  - Raze, No Fish: Pillage or Conquer Nearby only.  
  - Fish + Raze: Pillage or Conquer Nearby or Distant.  
- Return Ship and discard used Fish/Raze, even if unused.  
- Do not refresh Island display until Cleanup.  

#### Keywords & Icons  
- **Gain**: Take Goods from supply.  
- **Spend**: Return Resources to supply; place Workers on Clan Tile.  
- **Assign**: Place Goods on a card; remain until released.  
- **Release**: Return Assigned Goods to supply.  
- **Retrieve**: Return spent Worker from Clan Tile to supply.  
- **Copy**: Attach card to another; gain its name, type, and ability.  
- **Storage**: At end of Lookout Phase, gain Goods if enough Assigned Goods meet requirement.  
- **Search**: Look through deck, take specified card, reshuffle.  
- **Move Clan Action Pawn**: Change position of used (but not exhausted) pawn; does not activate new tile.  
- **Instant**: Resolve effect, discard.  
- **Building Bonus**: One-time effect when built.  

#### Clan-Specific Mechanics  
- **Hatshepsut**: Unchosen Lookout Cards become Soils under Fields; may pay Soils instead of Resources to build. Workers may be Assigned to Fields.  
- **Boudicca**: Rafts only for Pillaging Nearby Islands; cannot carry Fish/Raze. Fields require spending Ship/Raft to Harvest.  
- **Flavian**: Foundations are face-down Goods; used to meet Additional Requirements when Building.  
- **Glenn**: Copy Cards attach to others; gain full synergy. Easter Island allows repositioning Copies.  
- **Mackinnon**: Banks store Goods; gain interest via Gathering Interest.  
- **Nanurjuk**: Discard Fields for VP; discard Building Bonus-only cards after use.  
- **Panuk**: Score for Sets and Igloos; Crossroads give VP for Resources.  
- **Saikoro**: Exchange Resources with opponents; use opponent Cards under specific conditions.  
- **Trajana**: Some cards cost Resources equal to number of that type in Empire.  
- **Ulaf**: Gain 3rd Ship via Floki’s Workshop; Common Ships available via card effects.  
- **Umineko**: Adds Storage and Docking Phases.  
- **Urvart**: Place tokens on opponent Cards; gain Resource when activated.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Condition**:  
- If 25+ VP reached during **Action Phase**, game ends after current round.  
- If during **Expedition Phase**, next round is final.  

**Final Scoring**:  
- 1 VP per card in Empire (Basic Cards, Upgrades, Conquered Islands).  
- 1 VP per 2 unassigned Resources in supply.  
- 1 VP per unassigned Gold in supply.  
- 1 VP per unassigned Raze Token in supply.  

**Tiebreakers**:  
1. Most Location Cards in Empire.  
2. Most Workers.  
3. Most Cards in hand.  
4. Shared victory if still tied.
