# Mandala - Solo Version

## 1. Lore & Objective
You play against Master Yoga, an AI opponent, in a solo adaptation of Mandala. The goal is to score more points than Master Yoga by strategically placing and collecting colored cards in two mandalas. Points are earned by acquiring cards during mandala resolution based on field strength and river composition.

## 2. Components
- Standard Mandala deck of colored cards (exact number not specified, but includes 6 distinct colors)
- Two players' worth of rivers and fields (you and Master Yoga)
- Draw pile and discard pile
- Two mandalas (left and right), each with a mountain area for card stacking
- Score sheet for tracking points (implied from external file)

## 3. Setup
1. Shuffle the deck and deal:
   - 6 cards to your hand
   - 2 cards into your cup (reserved cards)
2. Deal 2 cards to Master Yoga’s cup. He has no hand.
3. Seed each mandala:
   - Draw 2 cards one at a time
   - Place them face-up in the mountain of each mandala from left to right (from your perspective)
   - Stack cards of the same color
4. Place remaining cards in a draw pile
5. Prepare discard pile

## 4. Gameplay Flow
1. You take the first turn following standard Mandala rules.
2. Then Master Yoga takes a turn, performing two consecutive moves:
   a. One move for the **left mandala**
   b. One move for the **right mandala**
3. Repeat until the game ends.

Each of Master Yoga’s two moves follows the same procedure:

### Master Yoga Move Procedure:
1. Draw the top card from the draw pile.
2. Evaluate:
   - **If the color is already in the current mandala’s mountain**: Place it there. Move ends.
   - **If the color is in your field**: Discard the card. Move ends.
   - **Otherwise**:
     - Place the card in Master Yoga’s field for this mandala.
     - Continue drawing cards and placing them in his field until one of these occurs:
       - A color already in the mountain is drawn → discard it, move ends.
       - A color in your field is drawn → discard it, move ends.
       - The sixth distinct color is placed in this mandala → mandala is complete. Move ends.

### Special Rule: Sixth Color Placement
If the **first** card drawn during Master Yoga’s move is the **sixth color** for the mandala, he may place it directly in the mountain instead of his field **only if**:
- He has **greater strength** (more field cards in this mandala than you) **and** the mountain has an **even number** of colors, **or**
- He has **less or equal strength** (≤ your field cards) **and** the mountain has an **odd number** of colors.

This condition effectively means Master Yoga places the sixth color in the mountain only if it gives him an advantage when cards are distributed.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Mandalas**: Two independent zones (left and right), each built with up to six different colors.
- **Field Cards**: Cards placed in Master Yoga’s or your field influence control and scoring.
- **Mountain**: Stacked cards of same color; built left to right.
- **River**: Tracks which colors each player has collected; affects tie-breaking during scoring.
- **Turn Order**: You → Master Yoga (two moves: left then right)
- **Card Flow**: Draw → Evaluate → Place (mountain, field, or discard)

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- The game ends by standard Mandala rules (e.g., draw pile exhaustion or mandala completion triggers endgame).
- If the game ends during Master Yoga’s move on the **left mandala**, he does **not** perform the right mandala move.
- **Mandala Resolution**:
  - Compare field strength (number of field cards in the mandala):
    - Player with more field cards chooses first.
    - If tied, the player who **did not complete** the mandala chooses first.
  - **When Master Yoga chooses**:
    1. Prefers color **not in his river**
       - If multiple, prefers one **not in your river**
    2. If all tied colors are in both rivers → chooses the one in the **highest position** (most valuable) in his river
    3. If all tied colors are not in his river but are in yours → chooses the one **most valuable to you**
    4. If all tied colors are in his river but not yours → chooses the one **most valuable to him**
    5. If still tied → chooses the leftmost color (from your perspective)

> Note: For simplicity, steps 2–4 may be skipped; only apply step 5 as tiebreaker.

- Score points based on card values in rivers (exact values not specified, but implied to be positional).
- You win if your total score > Master Yoga’s.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **What if Master Yoga draws a sixth color but doesn’t meet the special condition?**  
  → Place it in his field, not the mountain.

- **Can Master Yoga complete a mandala during his field-building phase?**  
  → Yes. When the sixth distinct color is placed in his field, the mandala is complete and the move ends.

- **Who resolves a mandala if Master Yoga completes it?**  
  → Standard resolution applies: field strength first, then “did not complete” rule.

- **Can Master Yoga place a card in the mountain if it matches a color in your field?**  
  → No. If the drawn card’s color is in your field, it is discarded immediately.

- **Are field cards shared between mandalas?**  
  → No. Field cards are tracked **per mandala**.
