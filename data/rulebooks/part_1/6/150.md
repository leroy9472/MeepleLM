## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
PitchCar is a fast-paced flicking game where players race colorful discs (cars) around a modular track. The objective is to be the first player to complete three laps and cross the finish line.

### 2. Components  
- 8 different colored racing discs (cars)  
- 10 curved track pieces  
- 6 straight track pieces  
- 16 barriers (railings)  
- 1 starting/finish line sticker  
- 1 black spacer disc (used for creating space or as a baffle in advanced rules)  
- 1 scoring pad and pen  
- Optional: Power-up chips, gadgets, expansion track pieces (e.g., chicanes, ramps, 45° curves, underpasses), crash chips  

*Note: Additional components may be included depending on expansions used (e.g., Extension 1–5, Action-Set, Power-ups).*

### 3. Setup  
1. Assemble the track using curved and straight pieces to form a closed loop. Insert barriers into side slots—placement (inside, outside, or alternating) affects difficulty and strategy.  
2. Place the start/finish line sticker across one straight section.  
3. Each player selects a colored racing disc.  
4. Determine starting order via a qualifying round (optional but recommended):  
   - Players flick their disc once around the track, counting flicks.  
   - Fewest flicks wins pole position; ties are broken by longest single flick.  
5. Place all discs behind the start line in starting order.  
6. Place the black spacer disc and scoring pad in the center of the table.  
7. For professional or advanced variants:  
   - Place the black spacer as a baffle (chicane) on the track (must not be touched).  
   - For Power-up variants: Randomly place Power-up or Gadget tiles on designated track sections.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Players take turns in numerical order (1, 2, 3, etc.), regardless of track position.  
2. On a turn:  
   - Flick your disc forward using one finger (index, middle, or thumb). Pushing is not allowed.  
   - A successful flick moves the disc along the track.  
3. After all players have taken a turn, repeat the order starting with player 1.  
4. Each time a player fully crosses the start/finish line, mark one lap on the scoring pad.  
5. The race ends when a player completes three laps.  
6. Other players continue until all cross the finish line for final placement.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Flicking**: Discs must be flicked, not pushed. Use fingernail contact for best control.  
- **Disc Spacing**:  
  - You may use the black spacer disc to create a gap (up to its width) between your disc and a wall or another disc to improve flicking angle.  
  - You may not move another player’s disc.  
- **Contact with Other Discs**:  
  - It is legal to hit other players’ discs.  
  - If your disc knocks another off the track:  
    - Your turn is invalid.  
    - Return your disc to its starting position.  
    - Help return the opponent’s disc to its original position.  
  - If your disc flips over (sticker side down):  
    - You skip your next turn.  
    - On the following turn, you may only flip your disc upright—no movement.  
    - An upside-down disc can still be hit by others.  
    - If an upside-down disc is knocked off, return it face-down to its prior position.  
- **Off the Track**:  
  - If your disc flies off due to your flick, return it to its starting position—turn ends.  
  - Leave your hand near the flick point to prove starting position.  
- **Chicanes (Professional Rules)**:  
  - The black spacer acts as a baffle. If your disc touches it, return your disc to start—turn ends.  
  - The baffle remains where it is if moved.  
- **Power-ups / Gadgets (Optional Variants)**:  
  - **Turbo**: Take an extra flick immediately.  
  - **Roll Cage**: Cancel one flip-over penalty.  
  - **Second Chance**: Re-flick your turn.  
  - **Sabotage**: Flip another car over.  
  - **Blown Engine**: Swap positions with the last-place player.  
  - **Blown Tire**: Move back 4 track spaces.  
  - **Oil Spill**: All cars on current track segment flip over.  
  - **You Suck at Racing**: Discard all power-ups and crash chips; return to start.  
  - **Gadgets (Wipeout Variant)**:  
    - Draw random gadgets placed on track.  
    - Only one gadget may be held at a time (except Autopilot).  
    - Use immediately or on future turn (unless picked up while falling off).  
    - Examples: Turbo (extra flick), Shield (avoid penalty), Magnet (pull opponent or gadget), Mine, Plasma Cannon, Missile, Quake (rearrange nearby pieces).  

- **Last Place Bonus (Bix-Car Rule)**:  
  - The car in last place gets **two flicks** per turn instead of one.

- **Crash Chips**:  
  - Each player starts with 1 Crash Chip.  
  - When you knock an opponent off, you may give them your chip.  
  - They return to last known location **upside-down**.  
  - You immediately take an additional turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- First player to complete **three laps** wins.  
- For championship play:  
  - Run multiple races.  
  - Award points:  
    - 1st: 10 pts  
    - 2nd: 6 pts  
    - 3rd: 4 pts  
    - 4th: 3 pts  
    - 5th: 2 pts  
    - 6th: 1 pt  
    - 7th–8th: 0 pts  
- Longest jump or fewest flicks in qualifying can serve as tiebreakers.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I push my car?**  
  A: No. Only flicking is allowed. Pushing invalidates the turn.  
- **Q: What if two discs are stuck together?**  
  A: In family rules, use spacer to separate. In professional rules, play as-is—no spacing allowed.  
- **Q: Can I flick through multiple track sections?**  
  A: Yes, but jumps cannot exceed **two track sections** without penalty.  
- **Q: What happens if I hit a gadget while falling off?**  
  A: You do **not** collect it until your next valid turn.  
- **Q: Can I use multiple power-ups at once?**  
  A: Yes, unless restricted (e.g., only one Turbo per turn unless otherwise stated).  
- **Q: What if the baffle (black disc) is moved?**  
  A: It stays in its new position—do not reset.  
- **Q: Can I aim to knock someone off intentionally?**  
  A: Yes, but your turn is invalidated, and both discs return to start of turn positions.
