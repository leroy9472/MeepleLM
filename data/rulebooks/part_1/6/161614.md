     - Place 1 Company and 1 Forecast Card face-up on board (public).  
     - Pair remaining cards and place face-down next to board.  
     *(2-player: Each player gets 2 pairs; 2 pairs placed face-down.)*  
   - **Supply Phase**  
     - Place 1 card from Market Deck face-up in each Stockpile (number = player count).  
     - Deal 2 cards from Market Deck to each player.  
     - In turn order, each player places both cards into Stockpiles:  
       - One face-up, one face-down  
       - May be in same or different Stockpiles  
     *(2-player: Repeat — each player places 4 cards total in two rounds of 2 cards each.)*  
   - **Demand Phase**  
     - In turn order, players place Bidding Meeple on open bid space of any Bidding Track.  
       - Must bid higher than any existing bid on that track  
       - Cannot exceed available cash  
       - Max bid: $25K  
     - If outbid, player retrieves Meeple and re-bids on next turn  
     - Re-bidding occurs in clockwise order after all have had one bid  
     - Bidding ends when each Stockpile has exactly one Meeple  
     - Players pay bid to bank, collect Stockpile  
     - Pay any Trading Fee Cards immediately  
       - If cannot pay, keep card face-up; pay when able  
     - Place Stock Cards face-down in Portfolio  
     - Action Cards held for Action Phase  
     *(2-player: Alternate bidding; cannot place both Meeples on same track; combined bids ≤ cash)*  
   - **Action Phase**  
     - In turn order, play all Action Cards:  
       - Stock Boom!: Choose 1 stock, increase value by 2  
       - Stock Bust!: Choose 1 stock, decrease value by 2  
     - Resolve Stock Splits or Bankruptcy if triggered  
   - **Selling Phase**  
     - In turn order, players may sell any number of stocks:  
       - Sell from regular Portfolio: receive current value per stock  
       - Sell from Split Portfolio: receive 2× current value per stock  
       - Or: move 1 stock from Split to regular Portfolio and sell for 1× value  
   - **Movement Phase**  
     - In turn order, reveal Company and Forecast Cards; move stock values accordingly  
     - Resolve public and face-down pairs  
     - All stocks are affected each round

       - Must reveal share to collect; may choose not to reveal  
   - **Stock Splits**  
     - If stock value > 10:  
       - All players reveal shares of that stock and move to Split Portfolio (face-down)  
       - Reset stock value to 6, then continue applying excess movement  
     - New shares acquired after split go to regular Portfolio  
     - If a stock splits again and a player already has it in Split Portfolio:  
       - Gain $10K per card in Split Portfolio  
       - Card remains in Split Portfolio  
   - **Bankruptcy**  
     - If stock value < 1:  
       - All players discard all shares of that stock (both Portfolios)  
       - Reset stock value to 5

   - Game ends after final Movement Phase  
   - All players:  
     1. Reveal all stocks  
     2. Determine Majority Shareholder for each company:  
        - Split Portfolio shares count as 2  
        - Majority: $10K (if tie, all tied players get $5K)  
     3. Sell all remaining stocks at final value (Split Portfolio ×2)
