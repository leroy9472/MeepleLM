## Point Salad — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Point Salad is a lighthearted card-drafting and tableau-building game where players assemble a salad by collecting veggie cards and point cards. The goal is to score the most victory points by fulfilling the conditions on your point cards using the veggie cards in your tableau.

### 2. Components  
- 108 double-sided cards  
  - Each card has a veggie side (featuring one of six veggie types: Carrot, Pepper, Tomato, Lettuce, Onion, Cabbage)  
  - Opposite side is a unique point card with a scoring condition  
- 1 Rulebook  

Note: The veggie type is shown in the corners of each card for easy identification.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Adjust deck size based on player count:**  
   - 2 players: Use 6 of each veggie (36 total)  
   - 3 players: Use 9 of each veggie (54 total)  
   - 4 players: Remove 6 of each veggie (72 total remain)  
   - 5 players: Remove 3 of each veggie (90 total remain)  
   - 6 players: Use full deck (108 cards)  
   - Removed cards are returned to the box unseen.  

2. Shuffle the remaining cards and divide them into **three roughly equal draw piles**, with **point sides face up**.  

3. From the top of each draw pile, flip **two cards veggie-side up** to form the **veggie market** (6 face-up veggie cards total).  

4. Randomly choose a starting player.

Optional: For multiple rounds, split the deck accordingly (e.g., 3 rounds of 36 cards for 2 players).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order. On your turn, perform **one** of the following actions:

- **Draft 1 point card**: Take the top card from any of the three draw piles. Add it to your tableau, **point side up**.  
- **Draft 2 veggie cards**: Take any two face-up veggie cards from the market. Add them to your tableau, **veggie side up**.

After drafting:
- **Optional free action**: Flip **one** of your point cards (from any turn, including this one) to its veggie side. This becomes a permanent veggie card in your tableau.  
- **Refill the market**:  
  - Replace any empty spots in the veggie market by drawing from the **top** of the corresponding draw pile and flipping the card **veggie-side up**.  
  - If a draw pile runs out, **split the largest remaining pile roughly in half** and move the bottom half to replace the empty pile. Ensure the top point card of the original pile remains visible.

Play passes to the next player.

**Note**: If only one veggie card remains in the market at the end of the game, a player may draft it as a single veggie card.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Drafting**: Choose between one point card or two veggie cards per turn.  
- **Tableau Building**: Collect cards in front of you; all remain face-up.  
- **Card Conversion**: Once per turn, flip one of your point cards into a veggie card. Cannot reverse.  
- **Market Refill**: After each turn, refill the market from draw piles, flipping cards to veggie side.  
- **Pile Management**: If a draw pile is exhausted, refill it from the bottom half of the largest pile.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game ends** when all cards (from draw piles and market) have been drafted.

**Scoring Process**:  
- For each of your **point cards**, evaluate its scoring condition using **all** of your veggie cards.  
- A single veggie card can contribute to **multiple point cards**.  
- A single point card can score **multiple times** if conditions are met repeatedly (e.g., multiple sets).  
- **Ties** on comparative conditions (e.g., "most onions"):  
  - If you own the point card, you **win the tie** and score the points.  
- **Zero counts** for "fewest" (e.g., 0 onions qualifies as fewest), but **does not count** as even (e.g., 0 of a veggie ≠ even number).  
- **Turn order tiebreaker**: If players tie in total points, the player **later in turn order** wins.

**Scoring Examples**:  
- 8 points per complete set of tomato, lettuce, and carrot  
- 5 points per pair of carrots  
- 3 points per carrot, -2 per onion  
- 10 points for having the most onions (tie goes to card owner)  
- 5 points per veggie type with at least 3 cards  
- 5 points per veggie type not owned  
- 3 points per veggie type with at least 2 cards  
- 12 points for a complete set of all six veggie types  
- 7 points if you have an even number of a specific veggie, 3 for odd  
- 10 points for most total veggie cards, 7 for fewest  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I flip a point card I just drafted?**  
  Yes, you may flip a point card into a veggie card on the same turn you draft it.  
- **Can I flip a veggie card into a point card?**  
  No. Conversion is one-way only: point → veggie.  
- **When do I refill the market?**  
  After you finish your entire turn (draft + optional flip). Refill all empty market spots at once.  
- **What if a draw pile runs out?**  
  Split the largest pile and move the bottom half to replace it. Maintain top card visibility.  
- **Can I draft only one veggie card?**  
  Only if it's the last card in the game. Otherwise, you must take two or draft a point card.  
- **Do unused veggies score?**  
  No. Only veggies that fulfill point card conditions contribute to scoring.
