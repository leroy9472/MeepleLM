## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players compete to build the most prosperous city in the kingdom by constructing districts and leveraging the powers of influential characters. The game ends when a player completes their 8th district (or 7th if using Bell Tower), and the player with the highest score wins. Victory points are based on district values and bonuses.

2. Components  
- Character Deck: Includes characters numbered 1–8 (base) and expansion characters (marked with *), including rank-9 characters (Witch, Tax Collector, Wizard, Emperor, Abbot, Alchemist, Navigator, Diplomat, Artist, Queen).  
- District Deck: Includes various colored districts (yellow/noble, blue/religious, green/trade, red/military, purple/special). Some cards are marked with * for expansion use.  
- Gold coins and bank  
- Crown counter (designates starting player and character selector)  
- Optional: Bell Tower, Great Wall, and other special districts with unique effects  

3. Setup  
- Shuffle the Character Deck. Decide whether to use base characters (1–8), expansion characters, or include rank-9 characters.  
- District Deck: Remove any *-marked district cards unless using expansion rules. Shuffle and deal 4 cards to each player. Place the rest face down as a draw pile.  
- Give each player 2 gold. Place remaining gold in the bank.  
- Randomly give the Crown counter to one player (often the oldest).  
- For games with 7 or 8 players, include rank-9 characters as needed.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of four steps:

Step 1: Remove Characters  
- Draw 1 character card and place it face down (removed from play).  
- Place additional cards face up based on player count:  
  - 4 players: 2 face-up cards  
  - 5 players: 1 face-up card  
  - 6 players: 0 face-up cards  
  - 7 players: Same as 6-player, but last player chooses between passed card and face-down card  
  - 8 players: Add a rank-9 character and follow 7-player rules  
- The King or Emperor may not be among the face-up cards. If one is drawn, replace it and reshuffle.

Step 2: Choose Characters  
- The player with the Crown looks at the remaining character cards, selects one secretly, and passes the rest to the left.  
- Players continue choosing in clockwise order until one card remains, which is placed face down with the unused cards.  
- In 2- or 3-player games, each player chooses 2 characters and plays two turns per round using the same resources.

Step 3: Player Turns  
- The Crown holder calls characters in numerical order (1 to 9).  
- When a character is called:  
  a) If the character was not chosen or was assassinated/bewitched, skip the turn.  
  b) Otherwise, the player reveals their character and takes a turn.  

On your turn:  
1) Take an Action (must do one):  
   - Take 2 gold from the bank, OR  
   - Draw 2 district cards, keep 1, and place the other on the bottom of the District Deck.  
2) Build a District (optional):  
   - Pay the gold cost to build one district from your hand.  
   - You may not build a duplicate of a district already in your city (except via Wizard or Quarry).  
   - Building your 8th district triggers the endgame (unless modified by Bell Tower).  
3) Use Character Power (optional, once per turn):  
   - May be used at any time during your turn.  
   - Powers that grant income (e.g., King, Merchant) must be used all at once—before or after building, but not split.

Step 4: End of Round  
- After all characters have taken turns, collect all character cards, shuffle them, and begin a new round.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Character Powers:  
  - **Assassin (1)**: Announce a character to murder. That player skips their turn.  
  - **Thief (2)**: Announce a character to steal from (not Assassin or murdered/bewitched character). Take all their gold when they are revealed.  
  - **Magician (3)**: Either exchange entire hand with another player, or discard any number of cards and draw equal number.  
  - **King (4)**: Receive 1 gold per yellow district. Immediately receive Crown; calls characters next round. If murdered but held King, still gains Crown at round end.  
  - **Bishop (5)**: Receive 1 gold per blue district. Immune to Warlord’s destruction.  
  - **Merchant (6)**: Receive 1 gold per green district. Gain 1 extra gold after taking action.  
  - **Architect (7)**: After action, draw 2 extra district cards. May build up to 3 districts this turn.  
  - **Warlord (8)**: Receive 1 gold per red district. At end of turn, may destroy any one district by paying (cost – 1) gold. Cannot destroy from completed city (8 districts).  
  - **Witch (1\*)**: After action, announce a character to bewitch. When that player is called, they take an action and end turn. You then resume their turn using their powers in your city. King still gains Crown.  
  - **Tax Collector (2\*)**: Any player who builds a district must give you 1 gold at end of turn (if able). Applies retroactively to Assassin/Witch if they built.  
  - **Wizard (3\*)**: Look at another player’s hand and take one card. May immediately build it (doesn’t count toward build limit) or add to hand. May build duplicate districts.  
  - **Emperor (4\*)**: Receive 1 gold per yellow district. When called, take Crown and give to another player, who must give you 1 gold or 1 card.  
  - **Abbot (5\*)**: Receive 1 gold per blue district. Player with most gold must pay you 1 gold (no payment if tie or you have most).  
  - **Alchemist (6\*)**: Get back all gold spent on building districts this turn. Cannot overspend.  
  - **Navigator (7\*)**: After action, receive 4 gold or 4 cards. Cannot build any district.  
  - **Diplomat (8\*)**: Receive 1 gold per red district. At end of turn, may exchange one of your districts for another player’s, paying the difference. Cannot take Keep or Bishop’s districts. Remove Cemetery from game if used.  
  - **Artist (9\*)**: Place 1 gold on up to 2 of your districts. Increases cost to destroy/exchange and final VP value by 1. Only 1 gold per district.  
  - **Queen (9\*)**: Receive 3 gold if seated next to King (or Emperor’s crown recipient). Only usable in 5+ player games.

- Special Districts (not exhaustive):  
  - **Bell Tower**: May trigger game end at 7 districts. Affects bonus scoring.  
  - **Quarry**: Allows building duplicate districts (max 2). Duplicates remain if Quarry is destroyed.  
  - **University / Dragon Gate**: Cost 6, worth 8 VPs. Warlord destroys for 5 gold.  
  - **Graveyard**: May gain destroyed district for 1 gold (not if Diplomat used).  
  - **Great Wall**: Increases cost to destroy/exchange your districts by 1.  
  - **Laboratory**: Spend 2 gold to discard a card and gain 1 gold.  
  - **Smithy**: Spend 2 gold to draw 3 cards.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after the current round in which a player builds their 8th district (or 7th if Bell Tower is active).  
- Final score = sum of VP values on all districts in city + bonuses.  
Bonuses:  
- +3 VP: One district of each of the 5 colors  
- +4 VP: First player to reach 8 (or 7) districts  
- +2 VP: Each other player who reaches 8 (or 7) districts  
- **Tiebreaker**:  
  1) Compare total base VP (excluding bonuses)  
  2) If still tied, player with most gold wins  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases

  A: Yes, but income powers (e.g., King, Merchant) must be used in one instance.
