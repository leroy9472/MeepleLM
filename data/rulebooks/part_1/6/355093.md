## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In the forest's thriving cottage industry of woodcraft, players begin with limited lumber and work to grow their craft by acquiring and manipulating dice (representing wood) to fulfill customer orders.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game takes place over 14 Rounds, with each player taking one turn per round in clockwise order starting with the Starting Player.

**Each Player's Turn consists of:**
1. **Tree Growth Phase**: Each die in pots grows by 2 pips (up to maximum 6). Any die reaching 6 is immediately moved to the Lumber Pile.
2. **Action Phase**: 
   - Select 1 Action Tile from the Action Wheel, gaining bonuses above and below it, and advance it clockwise to the next quadrant:
     - If next quadrant is empty, slide to far end.
     - Otherwise, slide into next available space before another tile.
     - If tile crosses black arrow, rotate saw to end of next quadrant.
     - A tile cannot be selected if it would move across the black arrow into a non-empty quadrant.
   - After moving the tile, choose one:
     - Perform the Action on the selected Tile.
     - Pay 1 Lantern to perform the Action on any other Tile.
     - Gain 3 Blueberries.
   - Additionally, you may:
     - Buy 1 Bonus Action for 3 Lanterns (perform any action without moving tiles or gaining bonuses).
     - Perform any number of Free Actions.
   - All actions (main, bonus, free) may be performed in any order.
3. **Marketing Phase**: Advance 1 space on Marketing Track by paying indicated Blueberries, gaining depicted VP, then moving counter right. If already on last space, may buy 11 VP for 12 Blueberries.
4. **Cleanup Phase**: Discard down to 6 dice in Lumber Pile.

After each player has taken a turn, move the Round Counter forward. If on an Income space, perform an Income Phase before the next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics

**Action Overview:**
- **Buy Lumber**: Buy 1-2 dice from Lumber Yard. Cost = die value + color modifier (Green: 0, Yellow: +1, Brown: +2). Value 6 dice get 2 Blueberry discount if 2nd Sawing Tile is placed. Replace bought dice by rolling.
- **Exchange Dice**: Sell 1 die for 2× value + color bonus (Yellow: +1, Brown: +2). Optionally buy a value 6 die from bank at normal price (must be different color if sold die).
- **Buy Materials**: Make 1-2 purchases of Glue, Scrapwood, or Sawblade Tokens (different types if buying 2).
- **Choose Orders**: Take 1 free order from display, then optionally pay 3 Blueberries for a second. After each selection, slide remaining cards right and refill. Orders must be placed immediately in matching row to the right of Player Board.
- **Choose a Helper**: Take 1 Helper from display, pay cost, and place orthogonally adjacent to existing Helper. Gain immediate ability (if any), advance on income track per placement space, and trigger production from up to depicted number of Helpers.
- **Produce/Plant a Tree**: 
  - Option A: Gain production from 2 different Helpers.
  - Option B: Gain production from 1 Helper AND plant a tree by moving a 1 or 2 die (or split piece) from Lumber Pile to empty Pot of same color. When Brown Pot is built, may plant 2 trees.
- **Improve Workshop**: Add one of:
  - **Pot**: Place Yellow before Brown. Pay cost, advance on Hazelnut Income Track, place 1-value die of color in Pot.
  - **Sawing Tile**: Pay cost, advance on Hazelnut Income Track. 1st tile gives 2 Blueberry discount on value 6 die purchases. 2nd tile also advances 2 spaces on Reputation Track.
  - **Splicing Tile**: Pay cost, advance on income track. 1st: +1 value. 2nd: +1 or +2. 3rd: +1 to +4.
  - **Gluing Tile**: Pay 4 Blueberries, advance 1 space on both income tracks.

**Free Actions (any number, any order):**
- **Sawing Lumber**: Flip available Sawing Tile. Choose die >1, split value across dice of same color. Pay 1 Sawblade Token per additional cut beyond first.
- **Splicing Scrapwood**: Discard 1 Scrapwood Token, flip available Splicing Tile, increase die value by amount on tile (max 6).
- **Gluing Lumber**: Discard 1 Glue Token, flip Gluing Tile, combine 2 dice (sum ≤6) into one. If different colors, choose color and gain 4 VP.
- **Harvesting a Tree**: Move die from Pot to Lumber Pile.
- **Tile-Reuse Token**: Discard 1 Tile-Reuse Token to flip used Sawing, Splicing, or Gluing Tile back to available.
- **Complete an Order**: Discard exact dice and tokens required. Gain card rewards, row rewards/penalties, and keep card facedown for end-game scoring.
- **Use Helper's Once-per-turn Ability**: Activate one such ability per turn.

**Tools in the Attic:**
- When acquiring a Tool, place on empty space in Attic (bottom row first).
- Upper spaces require pyramid support: 2 Tools below for middle row, 2 middle-row Tools below for top row (except top corners, which need only adjacent space filled).
- When placing, check adjacent spaces (horizontal/vertical). If adjacent Tool is different type, gain depicted reward.
- If Tool unavailable in supply, take any other Tool.

**Income Phase (occurs after Rounds 1, 5, 9, 13):**
1. Move all uncompleted Orders down one row. Orders moving below bottom row are discarded, and player loses 2 Reputation.
2. Each player places 1 Order from hand in appropriate row (skip if hand empty).
3. Gain Blueberries equal to Blueberry Income Track position and VP equal to Hazelnut Income Track position.
4. Reset all used Sawing, Splicing, and Gluing Tiles to available.
5. After Rounds 4 and 11: Discard 2 rightmost displayed Order and Helper cards, slide others right, and refill.
6. After Round 8: Discard all displayed Order and Helper cards and decks, replace with Late-game decks, and deal 4 new cards from each.
7. If end of track, proceed to End of Game.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends after the Income Phase following Round 13.

**Final Scoring:**
1. Score VP from claimed Public Contracts.
2. Sum values of leftover dice, remaining Blueberries, Scrapwood, Glue, and Sawblade Tokens. Divide total by 10 (round down) for VP.
3. For each remaining Order to the right of Player Board, lose 2 Reputation.
4. Multiply number of completed Orders by Reputation Track position (VP per Order).

**Winning:**
- Player with most VP wins.
- Tiebreaker: reverse turn order (last player wins, starting player loses).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Tree Growth**: Dice in pots grow at start of turn before any actions. Must be harvested (moved to Lumber Pile) immediately upon reaching 6.
- **Lumber Pile Limit**: May exceed 6 dice during turn, but must discard down to 6 at turn end.
- **Action Wheel Blocking**: A tile cannot move into a quadrant one lap behind. All tiles must leave starting quadrant before any can complete a full lap.
- **Public Contracts**: Multiple players can claim same contract in one round, but it becomes unavailable after that round. Claim by placing counter on contract.
- **Hazelnut Orders**: When completing, may choose to claim Public Contract instead of taking card rewards. Only one contract per completion.
- **Income Track Overflow**: If advancing beyond 10, leave counter on 10 and start new counter on 1. New counter cannot earn tool or 3-point rewards.
- **Score Track Overflow**: Beyond 50, move counter to 50+ space and restart at 0. Same for 100+ and 150+.
- **Reputation Track Overflow**: Beyond end, stay on last space and score 2 VP per advancement.
- **Penalties**: Cannot go below 0 on Score or Reputation tracks; stay at starting space.
- **Bonus Action**: Costs 3 Lanterns, performs any action without moving tiles or gaining wheel bonuses.
- **Alternative Actions**: After moving selected tile, may gain 3 Blueberries instead of performing its action, or pay 1 Lantern to perform any other tile's action (lantern cannot be one just received as bonus).
