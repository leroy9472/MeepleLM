## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In 1413, Henry V of Lancaster ascends the English throne with ambitions to unify England and conquer France. Players lead noble families vying to become the king’s most powerful ally. Victory is achieved by earning the most power points through strategic deployment of knights, influence in Parliament, and development of personal castles. The game ends after five rounds, and the player with the most power points wins (shared in case of a tie).

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each of 5 rounds consists of:  
(i) Placing Knights  
(ii) Parliament  
(iii) Rewards (Counties → Castles → Conflicts)  
(iv) Prepare Next Round

(i) Placing Knights  
- Players take turns placing one knight from their Court to a knight space.  
- Play continues clockwise until all knights are placed (skip players with none).  
- Placement options:  
  a. **County**:  
     - Knight must meet or exceed minimum strength (squires don’t count toward minimum).  
     - May place any number of squires (each adds +1 strength).  
     - Can expel opponent’s knight if total strength (knight + squires) exceeds theirs.  
     - Expelled knight returns to owner’s Court; squires return to supply.  
     - Cannot expel own knight.  
  b. **Castle**:  
     - Place on empty space in own castle.  
     - Each space holds one knight.  
  c. **Conflict**:  
     - Place on topmost empty space of a conflict card.  
     - Each player may occupy only one space per conflict.  
     - Can reinforce own knight by stacking (only in conflict).  
     - First 6 knights placed in conflicts may take one King’s Favor tile (immediate reward), then flip it face-down.  

(ii) Parliament  
- Vote on 3 new laws (bottom row), one at a time, left to right.  
- Voting:  
  - Secret, simultaneous vote using voting tile (✓ or ×) and optional voting markers.  
  - Each tile and marker counts as 1 vote.  
  - Tie → law approved.  
  - Used markers return to supply.  
- Result:  
  - Approved: slide top-row laws left, discard leftmost, place new law on right.  
  - Rejected: discard new law; top row unchanged.  
- Apply current laws (top row), left to right, after all votes.

(iii) Rewards  
a. **Counties** (A–I order):  
   - Occupying player chooses:  
     1. Take 1 nobleman tile from that county  
     2. Take county’s shown reward  
     3. Pay 3 gold to take both (nobleman first, then reward)  
   - Cannot take same nobleman twice.  
   - Knight returns to Court; squires to supply.  
   - **Surrey (I)**: Player also chooses next starting player (immediate effect). If unoccupied, current starter retains marker.  
   - **Dorset (H)**: Instead of reward, move knight to any conflict (no King’s Favor). Squires return to supply.  

b. **Castles** (starting player, then clockwise):  
   - Score rewards from:  
     1. Placed knights  
     2. Existing extensions  
     3. Company at table (1 voting marker per nobleman, including self)  
   - Player chooses order of scoring knights/extensions.  
   - Scored knights return to Court; extensions remain.  
   - No voting markers awarded in Round 5.  

c. **Conflicts** (resolve lower row first, then upper):  
   - For each conflict:  
     1. **Determine Winner**:  
        - England wins if total knight strength ≥ France’s strength (on card).  
        - Else, France wins.  
     2. **Rank Players**:  
        - By total strength of their knights in conflict.  
        - Tie: player who entered later (lower stack position) ranks higher.  
     3. **Assign Power Points**:  
        - **England Wins**:  
          - 1st: highest VP, 2nd: middle VP, 3rd: lowest VP (if players occupy ranks)  
          - Discard conflict card; knights return to Courts.  
        - **France Wins**:  
          - 1st: middle VP, 2nd: lowest VP; no 1st-place VP awarded  
          - If top row: move conflict and knights to lower row (order preserved)  
          - If lower row:  
             - Knights captured. In player order, players may ransom knights (pay 1 gold per strength level).  
             - Ransomed → return to Court; unpaid → return to reserve.  
             - Discard conflict card.  

(iv) Prepare Next Round  
- Reveal 2 new conflict cards (top row).  
- Flip all face-down King’s Favor tiles face-up.  
- Draw 3 new laws, place face-up left to right in bottom row.  
- If Surrey was occupied, new starting player takes marker.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Knight Strength & Squires**: Knight’s base strength must meet county minimum. Squires add +1 strength but can’t fulfill minimum.  
- **King’s Favor**: First 6 conflict placements earn immediate rewards (choose 1 of 6).  
- **Voting**: Secret simultaneous vote with optional enforcement via voting markers.  
- **Conflict Resolution**: Two-stage battle possible; ransom mechanic after second loss.  
- **Castle Scoring**: Extensions provide ongoing rewards; company at table grants voting markers.  
- **Noblemen**: Unique per player; contribute to final scoring and voting rewards.

6. Scoring & End Game  
After Round 5:  
1. **Greatest Army (Knighthood Strength)**:  
   - 8 points: highest total strength of knights *not in reserve*  
   - 4 points: second highest  
   - Tiebreaker: most squires  
   - Still tied: split applicable points equally (e.g., 12 ÷ 2 = 6 each; 4 ÷ 2 = 2 each)  
2. **Largest Castle (Extensions)**:  
   - 8 points: most extension tiles  
   - 4 points: second most  
   - Tiebreaker: most gold  
   - Still tied: split points equally  
3. **Noblemen**:  
   - For n noblemen: score n(n−1)/2 power points (e.g., 4 nobles → 6 points)  
   - No tiebreaker for noble count  
4. **Victory**: Highest total power points wins. Tie → shared victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a knight in a county with insufficient strength?**  
  No. Knight’s base strength must meet or exceed minimum. Squires cannot compensate.  
- **Can I add squires later to a knight in a county?**  
  No. Squires must be placed with the knight initially.  
- **Can I expel my own knight?**  
  No. You cannot expel your own knight from a county.  
- **What if I can’t take a King’s Favor reward?**  
  Forfeit the reward if the required knight isn’t available (e.g., no S1 knight for “New Knight” reward).  
- **Can I place a knight on a covered castle space?**  
  No. Extension tiles cover knight spaces; no knight can be placed there afterward.  
- **What happens if no knights are in a conflict?**  
  Conflict is lost. If in top row, card moves to lower row. If in lower row, card is discarded.  
- **Can I place my knight on top of an ally’s knight in a conflict?**  
  In 2-player game: no. Each player and ally occupies separate spaces.  
- **Are ransomed knights available immediately?**  
  Yes, they return to the owner’s Court and can be used in next round.
