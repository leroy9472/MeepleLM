### 1. Lore & Objective

- **Win:** Rescue 7 victims before the building collapses (i.e., run out of black damage cubes).  
- **Lose:** If 4 or more victims are lost to fire, or the building collapses (no black damage cubes remain).  
- *Optional Perfect Game:* Continue after rescuing 7 to save all 10 victims.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

On each turn, follow this sequence:

#### (1) Take Actions (3–5 AP depending on role)  
Each player has Action Points (AP) to spend. Unused AP can be saved (max 4) using green tokens. Free AP (e.g., from Captain) cannot be saved.

Available Actions:  
1. **Move (1–2 AP):**  
   - 1 AP: Move to adjacent empty/smoke square.  
   - 2 AP: Move through fire (cannot end there).  
   - 2 AP: Carry victim or Hazmat (not both) to open/smoke space.  

2. **Door (1 AP):** Open or close adjacent interior door.  

3. **Extinguish (1–2 AP):**  
   - 1 AP: Flip fire → smoke  
   - 1 AP: Remove smoke  
   - 2 AP: Remove fire (flip + remove)  

4. **Chop (2 AP):** Place 1 damage cube on adjacent wall. 2 cubes = destroyed (passable).  

5. **Drive (2 AP):**  
   - Ambulance: Any player can drive remotely.  
   - Engine: Must be on it to drive.  
   - Vehicles move one parking spot clockwise or counterclockwise.  

6. **Ride (Free):** Any firefighter on vehicle when it moves rides for free.  

7. **Crew Change (2 AP):** At start of turn, while on Engine, switch to another Specialist. Use new role’s AP minus 2.  

8. **Fire Deck Gun (4 AP):**  
   - Must be on Engine.  
   - No firefighters in target quadrant.  
   - Roll dice; flip to keep target in quadrant.  
   - Remove fire/smoke from target and 4 adjacent spaces (unless blocked by wall/closed door).  

9. **Captain’s Command (Free AP):**  
   - Get 2 free Command AP per turn to move **any other firefighter** (includes opening doors).  
   - Max 1 AP used on CAFS firefighter.  

*After all actions:*  
- If any **smoke** is adjacent to **fire**, flip it to fire.  

#### (2) Advance Fire  
Roll red d6 (row), black d8 (column) to determine target.

**A. Target Square:**  
- **Open (no smoke/fire):** Place smoke.  
  - If adjacent to fire → flip to fire.  
  - Any POI on square → lost.  
  - Firefighter present → knocked down.  

- **Smoke:** Flip to fire.  
  - POI → lost.  
  - Firefighter → knocked down.  
  - If Hazmat present → **explosion**, remove Hazmat, add HotSpot.  

- **Fire:** **Explosion!**  
  - Radiates in 4 directions (orthogonal).  
  - For each direction:  
    - Adjacent square:  
      - Open → place fire  
      - Smoke → flip to fire  
      - Wall → add 1 damage cube (2 = destroyed)  
      - Closed door → remove token  
      - Open/destroyed wall/door → continue (shockwave)  
    - Shockwave stops at:  
      - Closed door  
      - Undamaged wall  
      - Open space (places fire and stops)  

- **After explosion:**  
  - **Flashover:** Check all smoke adjacent to fire → flip to fire. Repeat until none remain.  

- **Hazmat in fire:** Triggers explosion → remove Hazmat, add HotSpot.  

- **HotSpot on target:**  
  - First, resolve normal Advance Fire.  
  - Then trigger **Flare Up**: roll again and repeat Advance Fire.  
  - If new target has HotSpot → repeat.  
  - When final target has no HotSpot → place a new HotSpot there.  
  - Only **1 HotSpot added per turn**. Pool: 6 (12 for Heroic).  

- **Remove fire tokens outside building.**  

- **Knocked Down Firefighter:** Move to current ambulance location. **Loses all saved AP.**  

- **Lost POI:** If fire appears on POI, it is lost. Reveal token. 4 lost victims = game over.  

#### (3) Replenish POIs  
- There must always be **3 POIs** on the board.  
- If <3, draw randomly and roll dice to place.  
- Invalid spaces (fire, smoke, firefighter, POI): follow arrow to next space.  
- If all invalid, reroll.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Adjacency  
- Orthogonal only (not diagonal).  
- Blocked by closed doors or undamaged walls.  
- Destroyed walls (2 damage cubes) and open doors do not block.  

#### HotSpot Rules  
- Causes **Flare Up** when targeted during Advance Fire.  
- Does **not** cause explosion or flip smoke to fire on its own.  
- Only one HotSpot added per Flare Up chain.  
- Pool limited (6 or 12).  

#### Hazmat  
- Explodes if fire appears on its square.  
- Remove Hazmat, trigger explosion, add HotSpot.  
- Can be carried out like a victim (2 AP per move).  

#### Vehicles  
- Protect occupants from knockdown and victim loss.  
- Ambulance rescues victim automatically if it moves to their parking spot.  
- Engine required to use Deck Gun.  

#### Specialist Roles (Examples)  
- **Captain:** 2 free Command AP per turn (move others).  
- **Paramedic:** Can treat victims; after treatment, any firefighter can carry victim at 1 AP.  
- **Dog:** Moves through walls with 1 damage cube. Cannot carry Hazmat.  
- **Structural Engineer:** Repairs walls (1 cube only), cannot extinguish.  
- **Suppression Specialist:** Can suppress Advance Fire effects on self/adjacent spaces.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Win Condition  
- **Immediately win** if 7 victims are rescued.  
- Optional: Continue to rescue all 10 for a Perfect Game.  

#### Lose Conditions  
- **4 or more victims lost** (fire on their square).  
- **No black damage cubes left** → building collapses. Game ends immediately.  
- *Note:* If out of fire/smoke tokens, continue without placing.
