## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Introduce paranoia into Courtly Love in *Shadows Over Camelot*. A Lady may be a False Lady (Queen of Spades), secretly undermining the knights. The goal is to manage romantic entanglements, complete quests, and uncover deception. Loyal Knights aim to expose the False Lady, while the Traitor may exploit her presence. The game ends with standard *Shadows Over Camelot* victory conditions, but Black Swords from False or dishonored Ladies impact the final sword count.

2. Components  
- Petition Cards: Use a standard deck of playing cards.  
  - Hearts = True Hearts  
  - Queen of Spades = False Lady  
- Lady Coats of Arms (from Romantic Actions)  
- Boon and Romantic Quest tokens (from Romantic Actions)  
- Standard *Shadows Over Camelot* components (quest boards, white/black cards, swords, etc.)

3. Setup  
- Use *Romantic Actions* rules: Assign each Knight a Lady, determine Romantic Quest via die roll, track Progress of Love.  
- Prepare Petition Card deck: Include all Hearts and Queen of Spades. Shuffle.  
- No player starts with a Petition Card.  
- For 7–8 players: False Lady is returned to deck after first discovery and only discarded on second reveal.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn:  
1. Progress Evil (draw black card, add siege engine, or lose life).  
2. Perform Heroic Action(s).  
3. (Optional) Progress Love (advance die on Progress of Love track).  
4. (Optional) Take Romantic Action (e.g., petition Lady, uphold honor, accuse).  

Romantic Actions involving Petition Cards (petitioning, accusing) follow core rules below.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Acquiring a Petition**: When a Knight rolls a new Romantic Quest, draw a Petition Card face-down from the deck and place it beside his coat of arms. He does not look at it.  
- **Affairs of the Heart**: A Knight may complete another Knight’s Romantic Quest. If he does:  
  - He must place a Petition Card face-down beside the Lady’s coat of arms (if he has one and hasn’t used Romantic Action).  
  - He gains the Boon.  
  - The original Knight may continue only if he also plays a Petition Card; otherwise, he must roll a new Romantic Quest (and gain a new Petition).  
  - A Knight on Romantic Quest 5 ("Renounce All Other Ladies") is automatically Scorned if he conducts an Affair.  
  - No more Affairs after all Petition Cards are played.  
- **The Go-Between**: As a Romantic Action, a Knight may add a Petition Card to another Knight’s Lady to re-roll his current Romantic Quest. Simpler than Gentle Courtesie (no need to forfeit Heroic Action).  
- **Accusing a Lady**: As a Romantic Action, a Knight may accuse any Lady (including his own) of being False, unless he is Scorned.  
  - Reveal one Petition Card beside her coat of arms.  
  - If False Lady: She is removed. Her Knight is no longer a Romantic Knight (no more Romantic Actions/Quests). Scorn effects end.  
  - If True Heart: The Lady’s Knight must Uphold her Honour via Duel of Honour.  
- **Upholding a Lady’s Honour**:  
  - Accuser and Lady’s Knight duel using Combat Cards.  
  - Excalibur and Sir Kay’s power may modify scores.  
  - Defender wins ties.  
  - If accused Knight is Scorned, he is restored for the duel.  
  - If Knight accused his own Lady, another Knight may volunteer as champion. If none, no duel, but accuser still discards one Combat Card.  
- **Duel Outcomes**:  
  - **Honour Upheld** (defender wins or ties): Defender claims Boon. Accuser must Progress Evil (lose life, add siege engine, or draw black card).  
  - **Honour Not Upheld** (defender loses or no champion): Lady gains a Black Sword (stain on reputation). Accuser draws 2 White Cards. The Knight who loves the Lady is Scorned (regardless of defense).  
  - **Dishonour**: If a duelling Knight plays no Combat Card, he is dishonoured: misses next Heroic and Romantic Action. If both fail, both are dishonoured, honour is upheld, no Boon, and Evil is Progressed.  
- **Traitor Rules**:  
  - Unmasked Traitor may add a Petition Card to any Lady (drawn from deck) instead of taking a White Card from a Loyal Knight.  
  - If Scorned, Traitor may only petition Ladies of Jealous Knights, and not his own.  
  - Traitor’s Lady remains in play after unmasking.  
  - If Traitor’s Lady is accused:  
    - If True Heart: Traitor may nominate defender. If honour not upheld, Traitor is Scorned (if not already) and Lady gains Black Sword. If upheld, defender gets Boon and must Progress Evil.  
    - If False Lady: She becomes a Treacherous Lady (remains in play). If Traitor was Scorned, he is reconciled.  
    - Treacherous Lady’s Black Swords count at endgame for Traitor (replacing White Swords). Other Ladies’ Black Swords do not.  
    - Any Romantic Knight may claim Treacherous Lady’s Boon by petitioning her (no quest needed), but must Progress Evil to do so.  
- **Special Card Effects**:  
  - **Morgan**: Unmasked Traitor may look at one Lady’s Petition Cards to determine if True or False.  
  - **Guinevere**: Add a Petition Card to Queen Guinevere (if in play) or the drawing Knight’s Lady.  
  - **Clairvoyance**: Instead of viewing Black Cards, look at one other Lady’s Petition Cards (not your own).  
  - **Convocation**: Every Knight returning to Camelot draws a new Petition Card.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- At game end, reveal all Petition Cards in play.  
- If a Lady has the False Lady card, add a Black Sword to her coat of arms immediately.  
- All Black Swords on all Ladies’ coats of arms are added to the Round Table, replacing White Swords.  
- Victory is determined by standard *Shadows Over Camelot* rules: more White Swords than Black after all placements and flips.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Petition Card Depletion**: When all Petition Cards are used, no more Affairs or Go-Between actions are possible.  
- **False Lady Discard**: After first reveal, False Lady is discarded (except in 7–8 player games, where she is returned and discarded only on second discovery).  
- **Accusing Own Lady**: Automatically results in Black Sword on her coat of arms (honour not upheld), Knight is Scorned, accuser draws 2 White Cards.  
- **Traitor’s Advantage**: A False Lady who becomes a Treacherous Lady allows the Traitor to convert her Black Swords into the Round Table, potentially swinging the game.  
- **Boon Usage**: Boons (including from Treacherous Lady) can only be used if the Knight is not Scorned.
