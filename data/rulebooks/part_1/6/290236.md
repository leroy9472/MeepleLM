# Canvas — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are a painter competing in a prestigious art festival. Over the course of the game, you collect transparent Art Cards and layer them to create unique paintings. The order and combination of cards determine which design elements are visible and how you score. The objective is to earn the most points by completing three paintings that fulfill dynamic scoring conditions.

The player with the highest score wins Best in Show. In case of a tie, the player with the most Inspiration Tokens wins. If still tied, a neutral judge decides based on artistic merit.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order. On your turn, perform **one** of the following actions:

- To take a card further right, place **1 Inspiration Token** on each card you skip (left to right).  
- Take all **Inspiration Tokens** on the selected card.  
- **Slide remaining cards left** to fill the gap.  
- **Draw a new card** from the deck to refill the rightmost space.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Element Icons (Base Game)  
Each Art Card has icons in 5 color zones. The 4 core Elements are:  
- **Hue** (color wheel)  
- **Shape** (triangle)  
- **Texture** (striped square)  
- **Tone** (shaded circle in starburst)  

These count toward Scoring Card conditions. **Bonus icons do not count as elements**.

#### Special Icons  
- **Silver/Grey Bonus Ribbon**: Gain 1 Silver Ribbon for each **matching Element** on the painting.  
- **Mirror (Reflections expansion)**: Flip the card to change swatch colors (as shown by mirror icon).  
- **Gold Bonus Ribbon (Reflections)**: Gain 1 Gold Ribbon for each **adjacent** matching Element icon.  
- **Creativity (★) (Finishing Touches)**: Counts as **any one** basic Element. Declare its type when completing the painting. Each ★ can be a different element.  
- **Blend (Finishing Touches)**: Copies the icon from the swatch it points **from** to its own swatch.  
- **X2 (Kickstarter Mini-Expansion)**: Doubles the number of icons on the swatch it points to.  
- **Bonus Ribbon (Kickstarter)**: Grants 1 Silver Ribbon. No element required.

#### Scoring Card Evaluation  
- Each Scoring Card lists a condition (e.g., "Two pairs of the same element" for Repetition).  
- Clarifications and examples are on the **back** of each card.  
- Each **fulfillment** grants 1 ribbon of the card’s color.  
- Max ribbons per color is limited by the number shown on the Scoring Card.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I discard Art Cards?** No. Unused cards stay in hand for future paintings.  
- **Can I rearrange Art Cards after completing a painting?** No. Order is final once sleeve is closed.

- **Can I use expansions together?** Yes. Mark expansion cards with dots (R, F, T, etc.) to identify them.  
- **What if I have no Inspiration Tokens?** You can still take the leftmost card for free. You cannot skip cards.  
- **Can I complete a painting with fewer than 3 cards?** No. Exactly 3 Art Cards are required.
