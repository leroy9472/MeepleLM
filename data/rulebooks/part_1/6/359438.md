## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The game is set in a futuristic space mining economy where players compete to build influence across lunar and asteroid belt operations. Players manage resource cards to expand companies, conduct research, extract helium-3, and claim bonuses. The ultimate goal is to achieve the highest score by strategically advancing on company tracks, completing research, and optimizing resource use. A secondary opponent, LUNA, acts as an autonomous agent following scripted actions.

### 2. Components  
- Player resource cards (energy, research scientist, field scientist, generic resource types)  
- Player boards with research track, tank track, resting decks, and action slots  
- Company tracks with stations, bonus spaces, money barriers, and bonus thresholds  
- Luna deck (L), grade 2 stack (U), and discard pile (X)  
- Luna’s action slots and majority slots  
- CrypCoin tokens  
- Bonus markers and bonus tiles  
- Helium-3 markers and upload markers  

### 3. Setup  
- Each player receives their player board, starting decks, bonus markers, and starting resources.  
- Set up the central board with visible company tracks and card display.  
- Shuffle the main card deck and form the card display.  
- Prepare the Luna deck (L) and place her discard pile (X) nearby.  
- Place CrypCoins, bonus tiles, and other shared components within reach.  
- Position Luna’s markers on starting spaces of relevant tracks.  
- Place Luna’s bonus markers on the board.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of three phases:

#### Phase 1: Planning Phase (Simultaneous)  
a) All players place one card face down in each of their "ON" action slots.  
b) All players reveal these cards simultaneously.

#### Phase 2: Action Phase (Clockwise)  
Players take turns performing **one action** per turn, choosing from the following options:

- **Resource Action**: Use 1 or more resource cards of a **single type** to:  
  - Buy 1 card from the display, and/or  
  - Advance on any company track (1 space per resource unit used).  

- **Energy Expansion**: Use **all** of your energy cards to expand **one** company.  

- **Research Action**: Use 1 research scientist card to:  
  - Advance your upload marker on your research track.  
  - Claim the research point reward associated with the new space.  

- **Extraction Action**: Use 1 field scientist card to advance your helium-3 marker on your tank track.  

- **Bonus Placement**: Place 1 bonus marker on a vacant bonus space.  

**Drop Out of Action Phase**:  
At any time after taking an action, a player may choose to drop out by:  
a) Flipping all used cards face up.  
b) Picking up one of their resting decks.  
c) Moving all used cards to their resting decks.  
Once dropped out, the player skips remaining turns in this phase.

#### Phase 3: Preparation Phase for Next Round  
a) Flip the next special research plan face up; move its CrypCoin to the supplement space.  
b) Retrieve all bonus markers (including any bonus tiles).  
c) Refill the card display to full capacity.

### Luna’s Turn Sequence  

#### 1. Planning Phase (Luna)  
a) Place 1 face-down card from the Luna deck (L) into each of Luna’s "ON" action slots.  
b) Place 2 cards from the Luna deck into her majority slots and flip them face up.  
c) Perform any actions listed in the bottom center of those majority cards (e.g., "2/12").

#### 2. Action Phase (Luna)  
- During her turn: Flip the **leftmost** face-down card in Luna’s action slots and resolve its action section.  
- When flipping the **rightmost** action card:  
  - Resolve its actions.  
  - Then:  
    - Shuffle all face-up cards from her action slots into the discard pile (X).  
    - Check the top card of discard pile (X) to determine which card to discard from her majority slots.  
    - Remove that card from the majority slots and place it on (X).  
  - After this, skip Luna’s turn for the remainder of the round.

#### 3. Preparation Phase (Luna)  
- Retrieve all bonus markers (but **not** any bonus tiles).  
- Discard all cards currently in Luna’s majority slots to discard pile (X).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Use & Management  
- Cards are played from hand to action slots during the planning phase.  
- Used cards go to resting decks after dropping out.  
- Resting decks are picked up when dropping out, replenishing hand size.

#### Company Track Advancement  
- Players may advance on any company track using resource cards of a single type (1 space per unit).  
- The **most valuable** company track is determined by:  
  1. Most visible coin icons in the station.  
  2. If tied: the one with more vacant home spaces.  
  3. If still tied: alphabetical order by ID.  

#### Luna’s Special Rules  
- **Deck Replenishment (Standard & Advanced)**:  
  When Luna deck (L) is empty:  
  - Take discard pile (X), add 1 face-down card from grade 2 stack (U), shuffle, and form new Luna deck (L).  

- **Advanced Level Only**:  
  When Luna’s helium-3 marker **or** upload marker reaches or passes a Luna token (U):  
  - Add 1 face-down card from grade 2 stack (U) to the top of Luna deck (L).  

- **Luna’s Movement on Company Tracks**:  
  - Gains standard Crippin reward when passing bonus thresholds (and others gain it again when passing after her).  
  - Must pay money barrier costs if able (pays what she can if insufficient).  
  - Upon reaching the end of a track: for each additional space she would move, gains **2 CrypCoins** instead.  

- **General Luna Behavior**:  
  Luna **never** pays standard costs or receives standard bonuses/rewards unless explicitly stated on her cards.

#### Bonus Spaces  
- Players may place one bonus marker per action on a vacant bonus space.  
- Markers are retrieved during preparation phase.  
- Bonus tiles, if placed, are also retrieved unless specified otherwise (Luna does not retrieve bonus tiles).
