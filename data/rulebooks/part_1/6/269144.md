### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Phase A: Draw 2 Cards  
1. Starting player aligns central wheel so each player icon faces a card stack.  
2. Simultaneously, each player draws 2 cards from the stack matching their icon.  
3. Each player:  
   a. Discards 1 card face-up to discard pile of same color.  
   b. Chooses for the other card:  
      - **Buy:** Pay cost (reduced by 1 coin per previously bought card of same color; minimum 0)  
      - **Sell:** Return to box, gain coins shown on back  
4. Rotate wheel clockwise; repeat until all 5 stacks are exhausted.  

#### Phase A: Income  
5. All players gain coins equal to their **Income (yellow) track** value.  

#### Phase A: Take Colony  
6. In initiative order (starting with current first player), each player may:  
   - Take **1 colony tile** if Military (red) track ≥ requirement shown  
   - Only **1 colony per rank** allowed over the game  
   - Choose:  
     a. **Plunder:** Take green coin value; discard tile (do not flip)  
     b. **Integrate:** Pay red cost; flip tile; gain track bonuses shown on back  
   - **OR** skip to **Take & Use Monument** (see below)  

#### Phase A: Carve Statue  
7. In same order, each player may:  
   - Carve **1 statue** if Culture (blue) track ≥ threshold (6, 12, 20, 30)  
   - Only **1 statue per value** allowed  
   - Place unused bonus tile in statue slot; choose:  
     a. **Track Boost:** Color side up → gain boost shown (e.g., +4 to track)  
     b. **VP Boost:** VP side up → gain points at endgame equal to value shown  
   - **OR** skip to **Take & Use Monument**  

#### Phase B: Draft a Faceup Card  
8. Starting with first player, clockwise:  
   - Choose **1 top card** from any discard pile (color irrelevant)  
   - Choose to:  
     - **Buy:** Pay cost (same color discount applies)  
     - **Sell:** Gain coins from back  
   - Continue until all discard piles are empty.  

#### Phase B: Income, Take Colony, Carve Statue  
9. Repeat:  
   - Income (same as Phase A)  
   - Take Colony (same rules)  
   - Carve Statue (same rules)  

#### Phase B: Feed Your People  
10. Compare **Food (green) track** to **number of purchased cards** in tableau:  
   - If Food ≥ cards: no effect  
   - If Food < cards: **must discard cards** until Food ≥ card count  
     - For each card removed, **reduce associated track(s)** accordingly  
     - No compensation; effects are immediate  

#### Phase B: Buy Medals  
11. Players may buy:  
   - **Silver Medals:** Cost varies by epoch; place bonus tile in medal slot  
     - Score: ½ of corresponding track’s value (rounded down)  
   - **Gold Medals:** Cost varies; place gold medal token  
     - Score: 7 points per set of 5 different colored cards per medal  
   - **Limits:** Max 2 silver and 2 gold medals per player over game

After Epoch III, score:  

1. **Colonies:** Points shown on front (plundered) or back (integrated)  
2. **Statues:** Base points + (bonus tile VP value × statue value)  
   - Example: Statue (30) with 1-point VP tile → 30 + (1×30) = 60  
3. **Monuments:** Points shown on VP side if built  
4. **Silver Medals:** ½ of corresponding track value (rounded down)  
5. **Gold Medals:** 7 points per set of 5 different colored cards per medal  
6. **Cards:** Sum of all VP values on purchased cards  
7. **Marketplace Bonuses:**  
   - Coins below 2-point space → +2 VP each  
8. **Coins:** Every 5 coins = 1 VP; leftover coins are tiebreaker  

**Winning:** Highest total wins. Tiebreaker: most leftover coins.
