## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
- Players take on the roles of family members exploring a mysterious, ever-changing house across a campaign.  
- Initially, all players cooperate to uncover the house’s secrets.  
- When the Haunt is triggered, the game splits into two teams: one or more Traitors and the remaining Heroes.  
- The objective shifts based on the specific Haunt: the Heroes must complete their assigned goal, while the Traitor(s) attempt to fulfill a hidden opposing objective.  
- Victory is determined by which team completes their objective first.

2. Components  
(Information not provided in source – omitted)

3. Setup  
- Each player selects two Families to control for the entire campaign. The Fifth Family is not used.  
- Designate one Family as your Primary Branch and the other as your Secondary Branch. This designation is permanent.  
- Assemble the starting map: four starting tiles form the initial house, one in each region.  
- Each player chooses a character, assigning a name and age. If a character from a previous chapter is still alive, they may be reused.  
- Reveal the top card of the Legacy deck to set any campaign-specific starting conditions.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- **Non-Haunt Phase (Exploration Phase):**  
  1. Refresh all used Items and Omens.  
  2. Gain movement points equal to your character’s Speed.  
  3. Move and perform actions:  
     - Move through rooms; moving off the edge of the map triggers tile discovery.  
     - Draw a new tile and place it adjacent to the exit point. If the tile has an icon, draw the corresponding card (Event, Item, or Omen).  
     - Obstacles: small (1 extra move), large (2 extra moves), monsters or opponents cost movement to enter.  
     - Drawing from any deck (Event, Item, Omen) ends movement.  
     - Never seal off a region; redraw tiles that would do so.  
  4. Perform actions (one per type per turn):  
     - Use an Item, Omen, or perform a special action.  
     - When drawing an Omen card, roll the Haunt roll: roll 6 dice, sum them, and compare to the number of Omen cards in play. If the roll is less than the number of Omens, the Haunt begins.  
  5. Players alternate turns between their Family Branches (Primary and Secondary), controlling both Families but taking turns one character at a time.

- **Haunt Phase (After Haunt is Triggered):**  
  1. Resolve Haunt:  
     - Determine Traitor(s) based on Haunt rules.  
     - The Traitor player gives control of their Secondary Branch Family to the opposing player.  
     - The Traitor’s Primary Branch becomes the official Traitor character. If necessary, swap positions between Primary and Secondary so the Primary is on the tile where the Haunt was triggered.  
  2. Traitor Identity:  
     - In Hidden Traitor scenarios, the Traitor player chooses which of their two Families (Primary or Secondary) houses the Traitor.  
     - The Traitor wins only if their chosen Family fulfills the Trait or objective.  
     - The other player must deduce which Family is the Traitor.  
  3. Gameplay continues with the opposing player controlling both Hero Families (including the ex-Secondary of the Traitor), while the Traitor controls only their designated Traitor Family.  
  4. Monsters act after the Traitor, in numerical order.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Traits:** Each character has four traits: Speed, Might, Sanity, Knowledge.  
  - Damage: Losing a trait point reduces the value. Healing restores to original value.  
  - Dice Rolling: Roll a number of dice equal to the trait value. Each die shows 0–2. Total possible: 0 to 2×trait. Minimum roll is 1, maximum per roll is 8.  
- **Items and Cards:**  
  - Items and Omens: carried, can be used, and are tilted after use.  
  - Objects: carried but cannot be used.  
  - Heirloom: Once per game, when drawing an Item, you may choose to make it an heirloom (permanent).  
- **Attacks:**  
  - Basic Attack: Attacker and defender roll Might. Damage = difference in rolls.  
  - Weapons may use non-Might traits (e.g., Knowledge). If target lacks that trait, attack fails.  
  - Ranged attacks require line of sight; no line of sight between different regions.  
  - If attacking a target on another tile and losing, no damage is dealt.  
  - May forgo dealing 2+ damage to steal an Item, Omen, or Object.  
- **Monsters:**  
  - Can be stunned but not killed by basic attacks.  
  - Stunned monster takes no action if attacked successfully; if attack fails, it deals no damage.  
  - Stun lasts one turn.  
  - Follow behavior rules as defined in the Haunt (see rulebook page 20).  
- **Family Control:**  
  - Family items are not shared between Branches.  
  - No item exchange unless during Haunt setup (position switch only).  
  - Primary Branch is never given away; Secondary is handed over during Haunt.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is no traditional scoring system.  
- Game ends when either the Heroes or the Traitor(s) complete their Haunt-specific objectives.  
- The Traitor may still win even if their character dies (e.g., via monster actions fulfilling the objective).  
- After resolution, record the outcome per Legacy rules (e.g., unlock new content, modify components).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Tiebreaker:** Randomly draw a family crest.  
- **Character Death:** A character dies when any trait reaches the skull (zero). They drop all carried items.  
- **Family Absence:** A Family may skip chapters and rejoin later. If a Family misses more than half the played chapters, consult rulebook page 21.  
- **Hidden Traitor Strategy:** A Traitor may damage their own Secondary Family to mislead the opponent.  
- **Line of Sight:** No ranged attacks between regions. Line of sight required within the same region or connected tiles.  
- **Purgatory Deck:** Do not look through it. When drawing, fan cards to see only the number in the corner.  
- **Team Separation:** After public Haunt info is read, teams split to read private sections (Heroes: Secrets of Survival; Traitor: Traitor’s Tome), then reunite. All future discussion is public.  
- **Turn Order After Haunt:** The Hero to the left of the Traitor starts. Monsters act after the Traitor, in numerical order.
