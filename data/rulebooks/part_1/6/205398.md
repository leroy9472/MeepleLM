## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Citadels is a strategy game of city-building and character control. In this two-player variant, each player assumes control of two characters per round, aiming to construct a powerful city of districts. The objective is to be the first to build 10 districts and score the most points when the game ends.

### 2. Components  
- 18 character cards (8 base + 10 bonus)  
- 80 district cards (54 basic + 14 bonus purple districts)  
- 30 gold counters (infinite supply assumed)  
- 1 wooden Crown marker  
- 8 reference cards  
- Rulebook  

*Note: For this two-player variant, only the Witch, Thief, Wizard, King, Bishop, Merchant, Architect, and Warlord are used. Bonus characters and starred districts are excluded unless otherwise agreed.*

### 3. Setup  
1. **Remove** all bonus cards marked with a white star (10 bonus character cards and 14 purple bonus district cards).  
2. **Shuffle** the 8 remaining character cards into a Character Deck.  
3. **Shuffle** the 66 remaining district cards (54 basic + 12 purple marvels) into a District Deck.  
4. **Deal** 4 district cards face down to each player.  
5. Each player receives **2 gold** from the bank.  
6. The **oldest player** takes the Crown.  
7. Create **two separate district piles**:  
   - **Marvels Deck**: All purple districts costing **more than 3 gold**.  
   - **Standard Deck**: All other districts (cost 3 or less, regardless of color).  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this sequence:

#### Step 1: Character Selection  
1. The player with the Crown shuffles the Character Deck and places **1 card face down** in the center (removed from play this round).  
2. That player then secretly selects **1 character** for themselves and passes the remaining 6 to the opponent.  
3. The opponent selects **1 character**, places **1 face down** (discarded), and passes the remaining 4 back.  
4. The Crown player selects **1**, places **1 face down**, and passes the last 2 back.  
5. The opponent takes **1**, places the last **face down**.  
6. Each player now has **2 characters** (unrevealed until played).  

#### Step 2: Turn Order & Play  
- The Crown player calls characters in **numerical rank order** (1 to 8).  
- When a character is called, if a player holds it, they **reveal it** and take their turn.  
- Each player will take **two turns per round**, one for each character they selected.  
- A player **cannot call a character they hold** — doing so would spoil their hidden selection.  

#### Step 3: Character Turn  
On a character’s turn, the player must:  
1. **Take an Action**: Choose one:  
   - Take **2 gold** from the bank, or  
   - Draw **2 district cards** from a deck, choose **1** to keep, place the other on the **bottom** of that deck.  
     - *Note: The Architect chooses which deck to draw from (see below).*  
2. **Build a District (Optional)**:  
   - Play **1 district card** from hand to their city.  
   - Pay its **gold cost** to the bank.  
   - Cannot build **duplicate districts** unless:  
     - The player owns the **Quarry district**, OR  
     - The **Wizard** is used (allows building duplicates this turn).  

#### Step 4: Character Abilities  
Each character may use their ability **once per turn**, unless otherwise restricted. Key changes for this variant:  

- **Witch**: After taking action, name a character to **bewitch**. When that character is called, they take action, then end turn. The Witch then **resumes their turn**, using the bewitched character’s abilities (e.g., Merchant’s extra gold, Bishop’s protection).  
- **Thief**: Name a character to **rob**. When that character is called, take **all their gold**. Cannot steal from Assassin or bewitched character.  
- **Wizard**: Look at another player’s hand and **take 1 card**. May **add it to hand** or **build it immediately** (does not count toward building limit). During this turn, **duplicate builds are allowed**.  
- **King**: Receives **1 gold per yellow (noble) district** in city. Uses **Artist’s ability**: can **beautify one district** by spending 1 gold (increases cost and point value by 1; only once per district).  
- **Bishop**: Receives **1 gold per blue (religious) district**. **Immune** to Warlord’s destruction.  
- **Merchant**: Receives **1 gold per green (trade) district** and **1 extra gold** after taking action.  
- **Architect**: After taking action:  
   - May draw **2 cards from the Standard Deck**, OR  
   - Draw **1 card from the Marvels Deck**.  
   - May **build up to 3 districts** this turn.  
- **Warlord**: Receives **1 gold per red (military) district**. At end of turn, may **destroy one district** by paying **(cost – 1) gold**.  
   - **Cannot destroy Marvels (purple)** districts.  
   - May destroy **own districts**.  
   - **No restriction** based on opponent’s district count (can destroy even if opponent has 10).  

#### Step 4: End of Round  
- All played character cards are returned to the deck.  
- Deck is shuffled.  
- Crown passes to the next player (if King was played, current King takes Crown).  
- New round begins.

### 5. Core Mechanics

  - Max **10 districts per player**.

- **Deck Splitting**:

- **Character Use**:  
  - Each player plays **two characters per round**.  
  - Character abilities are used **only during that character’s turn**.  
  - Gold and districts are **shared** between both characters.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game

  1. **Base Points**: Sum of **gold costs** of all districts in city.

  4. **Others at 10**: **+2 points** for any other player who also has 10 districts.

  2. If still tied, highest **gold remaining**.
