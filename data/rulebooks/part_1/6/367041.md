The game ends after all four Caliph Cards have been revealed, followed by one final round.

### 3. Setup
1. Place the **Main Board** in the center. Shuffle each of the 8 Translator decks and place them on their designated spots at the top of the board.
2. Shuffle the **48 Scroll Cards**. Place 6 face-up on the Map and 3 face-up on the House of Wisdom (one per Guild column, top space). Form the **Scroll Draw Pile** using the Caliph Setup Card: create stacks with 2–4 Scroll Cards and one random Caliph Card per stack (except top stack has 3 Scrolls, bottom has 1), then stack them in order.
3. Shuffle **10 Starting Translators**, reveal 4, and place each in its numbered Room. Place a **Resource Card** face-up below each.
4. Give each player:
   - Player Board, 7 Action Cards, 20 Influence, 6 Research Markers, 1 Player Marker, 1 Bag.
   - Place Research Markers on "0" of each Research Track; Player Marker on top-center of Map.
5. Place **Neutral Marker** on bottom-center of Map. Place all resources in the **Main Supply**.
6. Determine first player; give them the **First Player Marker**.
7. Shuffle **6 Goal Cards**, deal 1 to each player. Place it on the rightmost slot of their Player Board with a White Worker on top, a colored Worker below, and the indicated secondary Die.
8. Give each player their matching **Starting Scroll Card** (same character as Goal Card); place it face-up above their board.
9. In reverse turn order, players choose a Starting Translator and its Resource Card:
   - Place Influence on the chosen Translator.
   - Collect and resolve the Resource Card top to bottom (add Dice to bag, draw and roll 4 Dice, gain Gold/Silver/Workers, gain bonuses like research advancement or influencing).
10. Unselected Translators are **Neutral**; return unused Resource Cards to the box.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round, players take turns in clockwise order. On a turn, a player must choose to either **Work** or **Rest**.

#### Work
1. Play an **Action Card** into an empty Action Slot on your Player Board.
2. Place 1 or 2 Dice from your hand onto the card.
3. Optionally use Workers to modify Dice:
   - Same color: increase Die to 6.
   - Different color: change Die color.
   - Max 2 Workers per Die; cannot create secondary colors with two Workers on one Die.
4. Resolve the **main action** (Recruit, Travel, Research, Translate) based on the Action Slot.
5. Resolve any **small actions** on the played Action Card.
6. Workers remain on the card until Rest.

#### Rest
Must have at least one Action Card on your board.
1. **Reveal Bottom Scroll Card**:
   - If **Caliph Card**: place in leftmost Caliph space, resolve event, resolve Guild rewards/consolation, reassess control. Stop drawing.
   - If **Scroll Card**: move Neutral Marker clockwise equal to the card’s VP, skipping White Spots. 
     - If destination Scroll has Influence: new card goes to leftmost empty Guild or is discarded.
     - If no Influence: new card replaces it; old card goes to leftmost empty Guild or is discarded.
2. **Gain Income**: resolve all Rest icons on Player Board left to right (includes Research Track harvests, Action Card effects).
3. **Return Used Dice** to your Bag.
4. **Return Action Cards and Workers** to hand and supply.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Action Colour and Value
- Actions have a **value** (1–12, from Die pips) and **color** (white, primary, or secondary).
- **Secondary colors** form when:
  - Two different primary colors are used.
  - Two different secondary colors allow choice.
  - Secondary takes priority over primary.
- Value is "up to" the total pips; you may underspend.

#### Recruit
- Use action value (color irrelevant).
- Choose a Translator with value ≤ your action.
- **Dispatch**: resolve top-right effect, move to bottom of deck.
- **Employ**: pay Room’s Silver cost, resolve Room’s immediate effect, flip card, place Influence.

#### Travel
- Move your Player Marker up to action value clockwise on Map (both White and Black Spots).
- Gain bonus if you cross the path matching your action color (2 Silver for secondary, gain Die for primary).
- **White Spot**: gain immediate benefit (e.g., Silver, Die).
- **Black Spot**: may **Deliver Scroll** by:
  1. Pay 4 Silver.
  2. Place Scroll in top available space of any Guild (fill top to bottom).
  3. If Scroll had opponent’s Influence, pay them 1 Silver, remove it.
  4. Gain Influence and Gold as shown on space.
  5. Move up 1 space on Scroll’s Research Track.
  6. Draw top card from Scroll Draw Pile to fill Map spot. If Caliph, resolve it.

#### Research
- Based on value and color:
  - **1+** (any color): gain 1 Silver, 1 Worker of any color.
  - **4+** (colored): pay 1 Gold → gain 2 Silver, move up 1 on matching color Research Track.
  - **8+** (colored): gain 2 Silver, move up 1 on matching color Research Track.
  - **10+** (colored): pay 2 Gold → gain 2 Silver, move up 2 on matching color Research Track.
- Moving onto **transparent (odd)** spaces: resolve immediate benefit.
- Moving past level 7: gain 1 Influence or 1 Gold (per track).

#### Translate
- Action color must match the Guild color of the target Scroll.
- Steps:
  1. Choose Scroll in House of Wisdom under matching Guild.
  2. Place 1 Gold on each Translator needed to translate from Scroll’s language to Arabic (cannot reuse a language).
  3. Pay 1 Silver to owner of each used Translator (to supply for Neutral).
  4. Take the Scroll, place above your Player Board.
  5. In either order: move up 1 on Scroll’s Research Track, resolve middle effect.
  6. Slide up Scrolls in House of Wisdom.
  7. **Retire** any Translator that meets its Gold requirement.

#### Retiring Translators
- **Employed Translator**:
  1. Return all Gold to supply.
  2. Return Influence to owner’s supply.
  3. Owner tucks card under one of 4 brown Action Slots.
  4. Pay 1 Silver (or add 1 White Die) for each card already under that slot.
- **Neutral Translator**: return Gold, move card to bottom of deck.

#### Caliph Cards
- Revealed during **Deliver** or **Rest**.
- Steps:
  1. Place in leftmost Caliph space.
  2. Resolve space event:
     - Event 1: 1 Gold to each Starting Translator; 1 Silver to owner per retired Starting Translator.
     - Event 2: Add Neutral Translator to leftmost empty Room.
     - Events 3–4: Add top pictured Translator not in play (or top if all present).
  3. For each Guild (left to right): controlling player moves 1 Influence to Caliph space, chooses reward (VP, Die, Gold, or retire Translator).
  4. Non-controlling players with Influence gain consolation (Worker, Silver, or Gold).
  5. Reassess control.

#### Influence
- Used to:
  - **Own Translators** (via Employ).
  - **Influence Scrolls** (pay 1 Silver to owner when interacting).
  - **Control Guilds** (most Influence wins; top space = control).
  - **Score on Caliph Cards** (Influence placed here stays until game end).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End**: triggered when 4th Caliph Card is revealed. Finish current round, play one more full round.
- **Final Actions**: take Gold from your Employed Translators into your supply.
- **Scoring**:
  - **Dice Sum**: (Total colored Dice) – (White Dice). Rank players; VP from black banner (6/4/2/0 or similar).
  - **Retired Translators**: VP printed on cards under Player Board.
  - **Guilds**: 3 VP per controlled Guild.
  - **Caliph Cards**: 3 VP per Influence on top space, 1 VP per middle space.
  - **Research Tracks**: 
    - Level 7: 5 VP
    - Level 6: 4 VP
    - Level 5: 3 VP
    - Levels 3–4: 2 VP
    - Levels 1–2: 1 VP
  - **Translated Scrolls**: VP as printed; if multiple of same language, each scores fully.
