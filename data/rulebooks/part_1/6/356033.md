## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Libertalia: Winds of Galecrest is a competitive card-driven board game for 2–6 players. Players take on the roles of pirate captains navigating the treacherous skies of Galecrest in search of treasure, reputation, and glory. Over the course of three voyages, players use character cards to claim loot, activate abilities, and gain doubloons. The goal is to accumulate the most doubloons in your treasure chest by the end of the third voyage. In case of a tie, the player with the highest reputation wins.

2. Components  
- Game board with Calm, Stormy, and Uncharted sides  
- Independent island tiles  
- Player decks of character cards  
- Loot tokens  
- Doubloons (currency/points)  
- Reputation hexes and markers  
- Treasure chests (one per player)  
- Score dials  

3. Setup  
1. Choose a board side: Calm, Stormy, or Uncharted. Combine with independent tiles as desired, placing them to cover or replace base tiles.  
2. Each player receives:  
   - A full character card deck  
   - A treasure chest  
   - A reputation hex  
3. Shuffle all 6 reputation markers and randomly assign them to players to determine starting reputation order.  
4. One player draws 6 character cards at random and reveals them. All players locate and extract these same 6 cards from their own decks.  
5. Proceed to “Before Each Voyage” steps.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game consists of three voyages. Each voyage is made up of multiple days. Each day follows this sequence:

1. **Before Each Voyage**  
   - Place 1 loot token per player on the current day’s island.  
   - Each player receives the same 6 character cards (as determined during setup).  
   - Each player gains doubloons based on their current reputation position.

2. **During Voyage (Per Day)**  
   - **Step 1:** Each player selects one character card to play face down.  
   - **Step 2:** Reveal all cards. Arrange them on the island from lowest to highest number.  
     - In case of ties, the player with the higher reputation places their card to the right (i.e., wins the tie).  
   - **Step 3 (Daytime):** Activate character abilities from left to right (lowest to highest number).  
   - **Step 4 (Dusk):** Activate from right to left (highest to lowest number). Each player collects one loot token from the current day’s island.  
   - **Step 5 (Night):** All Night abilities trigger simultaneously. Players resolve them in any order they choose.  
   - **Step 6:** Repeat this daily cycle until all days of the current voyage are complete.

3. **End of Each Voyage**  
   - Activate Anchor abilities (from character cards and loot tokens) in any order.  
   - Update score dials and convert earned doubloons into permanent points stored in your treasure chest.  
   - Discard all loot tokens and character cards currently in ships (played during the voyage).

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Play & Turn Order:** Players simultaneously choose a character card each day. Turn order is determined by card number (low to high) during Daytime, and reverse (high to low) during Dusk.  
- **Tiebreaker:** Highest reputation breaks ties in turn order placement.  
- **Daytime Abilities:** Resolved left to right; often grant actions, movement, or immediate effects.  
- **Dusk Phase:** Right-to-left activation; primarily for claiming loot tokens.  
- **Night Abilities:** Trigger after Dusk; resolved simultaneously and in any player-chosen order.  
- **Anchor Abilities:** Activated only at the end of a voyage; found on certain character and loot cards.  
- **Doubloons:** Represent points. Earned during voyages and converted into locked points in the treasure chest at the end of each voyage.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends immediately after the third voyage.  
- The winner is the player with the most doubloons in their treasure chest.  
- In case of a tie, the player with the highest reputation (as tracked on the reputation track) wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What happens if two players play the same number card?**  
  The player with the higher reputation places their card to the right (i.e., is considered higher for turn order).  
- **Can Night abilities affect Dusk loot collection?**  
  No. Dusk loot is collected before Night abilities trigger.  
- **Are Anchor abilities mandatory?**  
  No. Players may choose the order and whether to activate them, but all applicable Anchor abilities must be resolved before moving on.  
- **Do players keep unused character cards?**  
  No. At the end of each voyage, all played character cards and associated loot are discarded.  
- **Are the same 6 cards used in all three voyages?**  
  Yes. Each player uses the same set of 6 character cards in each voyage.
