## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Mice & Mystics is a cooperative adventure game where players take on the roles of enchanted mice navigating dangerous environments, battling minions, and overcoming obstacles. The overarching goal is to complete chapter-specific objectives while surviving threats and managing resources. Victory is achieved by fulfilling the chapter’s victory condition, typically clearing areas of enemies or progressing through story beats. Defeat occurs if all mice are captured simultaneously.

2. Components  
- Mouse character cards and figures  
- Minion figures (rats, roaches, spiders, etc.)  
- Storyboard with hourglass and end marker  
- Minion Wheel (cheese tracker for surges)  
- Dice (custom symbols: sword, bow, shield, cheese, blank)  
- Search cards (equipment, tricks, events)  
- Ability cards  
- Encounter cards  
- Room tiles (double-sided)  
- Tokens: wound, stunned, webbed, charmed, knocked down, hourglass, cheese  
- Equipment items (weapons, accessories)

3. Setup  
- Assemble the storyboard; place hourglass and chapter end marker per chapter instructions.  
- Select mice per chapter rules (e.g., Prologue: 4 mice, Lily excluded).  
- Each mouse starts with starting equipment, 1 ability (after Prologue), and 2 cheese (per "Just Cheese" rule).  
- Build encounter deck per chapter (remove Trick, Event, and Party Item cards unless specified).  
- Place room tiles as directed (e.g., Prologue: Guard Room → Kitchen → Kitchen Tunnels).  
- Place starting minions on entry spaces:  
  - Small-ranged: red-bordered area or farthest from mice  
  - Large: closest entry space  
  - Small-melee: spread evenly across remaining entries  
- Mousetraps: place on red Xs if encounter card specifies.  
- Set initiative: shuffle mice and encounter minions; place cards on track from top to bottom.  
- No encounter card in Prologue; use special setups.

4. Gameplay Flow  
A full game round consists of:  
1. Mouse Turns (in initiative order)  
2. Minion Turns (in initiative order)  
3. End-of-Round Check  

Mouse Turn:  
- Roll for movement (die + Move value)  
- Perform: MOVE + 1 Standard Action (Battle, Search, Scurry, Recover, Explore) + any Free Actions (Share, Equip, Level Up — once each, any time)  
- Free actions cannot be used in water  

Minion Turn:  
- Controlled by player with lowest-initiative mouse  
- All minions of same type act together, starting with those closest to mice  
- Each minion: MOVE → BATTLE  
- Melee: move shortest path to closest mouse; if equidistant, target highest on initiative  
- Ranged: move only to gain line-of-sight  
- Attack: target closest unattacked mouse; if all attacked, target highest on initiative  
- After all minion turns, check: if no minions remain and last mouse has acted, add 1 cheese to Minion Wheel

5. Core Mechanics  
- Movement:  
  - Adjacent spaces cost 1 move  
  - Yellow lines: 3 move points against arrow, 1 with  
  - Red lines: impassable without special ability  
  - Water: entering or exiting ends movement; escape requires roll (1 die per mouse on destination space; ≥1 cheese to succeed)  
  - Current: at end of turn, move 1 space in current direction; exit = captured  

- Battle:  
  - Melee: same or adjacent space; roll battle dice (sword = hit)  
  - Ranged: line-of-sight required; bow = hit; if adjacent enemy, must attack it  
  - Defense: if hits scored, defender rolls defense dice (shield blocks)  
  - Cheese: each cheese rolled by mouse = +1 cheese token; by minion = +1 to Minion Wheel  

- Abilities:  
  - One ability per mouse turn, regardless of user  
  - Level Up: spend 6 cheese for 1 ability card (class-matched)  

- Special Rules:  
  - Attack of Opportunity: moving onto minion space stops movement; can only leave if #mice ≥ #minions on space  
  - Mousetrap: pause movement; roll Move (or Lore if Tinkerer); ≥1 cheese = safe; else: take 1 wound, gain 1 cheese, knocked down, turn ends  
  - Captured: when wounds ≥ life; discard cheese and equipped items; hourglass +1; rescued automatically when no minions, on next turn  
  - Knocked Unconscious (simplified): lose 1 random non-starting item, hourglass +1, placed prone, can be healed or revived when tile cleared  
  - Status Effects:  
    - Stunned: can move, only action is Recover  
    - Webbed: cannot move or scurry until Recover (roll ≥1 cheese)  
    - On Fire: end in water or roll ≥1 cheese (dice = # mice on space) to extinguish; else take 1 wound  
    - Charmed: acts as minion; effect ends after turn  
    - Knocked Down: spend entire move to stand  

- Grapes:  
  - Roach Bait: mouse may place grape token adjacent; roaches move toward it; if ≥1 ends on it, all on space are discarded  
  - Rat Weapon: rat on grape space makes ranged grape attack (vs. space with most mice)  
  - Fork Launch: mouse with fork may launch grape; flip like coin:  
    - SPLAT: all on target space take 1 hit (defended normally); discard grape; shuffle into search deck  
    - NORMAL: all knocked down; grape remains as bait/weapon  

- Explore:  
  - Requires no minions on tile  
  - Use action to exit via exit bar or flip space  
  - Move all mice to adjacent space on new tile or flip space on flipped tile  
  - Triggers encounter if area not previously explored  

- Surges:  
  - Trigger when Minion Wheel reaches 6+ cheese  
  - Move hourglass +1 page  
  - Follow surge rules on current encounter card or chapter/tile; discard card  
  - If none, no minions placed  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- No traditional scoring; victory/defeat based on objectives  
- Victory: complete chapter objective (e.g., clear Kitchen Tunnels)  
- Defeat: all mice captured simultaneously  
- Achievements (trigger narrative and mechanical benefits):  
  - Cheesemaster: first to roll 3+ cheese in one roll; chapter marker +1; grants cheese on defense  
  - Roachmaster: defeats 4+ roaches in one encounter; roaches no longer greedy  
  - Scaper: captured twice; chapter marker +1; third capture: rescued immediately, no item loss  
  - Poisonmaster: captured with poison wound; converts future poison to normal wounds  
  - Cat Tamer: defeats Brodie; large minions roll -1 die vs. Cat Tamer  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can a mouse use multiple free actions? Yes, all free actions (Share, Equip, Level Up) may be used once per turn, in any order, not during another action.  
- Can you move through water spaces? Yes, but each water entry ends movement; exiting requires escape roll.  
- What happens if a surge occurs but no encounter card? Follow chapter/tile surge rules; if none, do nothing after moving hourglass.  
- Can a stunned mouse use free actions? No; only action allowed is Recover.  
- Do minions move if they can see a mouse? Ranged minions only move if they cannot see any mouse.  
- Can you attack through red lines? No; red lines block line-of-sight and movement.  
- Does cheese from minion rolls go to wheel immediately? Yes — before any other effects.  
- Can you share in water? No — free actions prohibited in water.  
- Can a mouse level up mid-combat? Yes, as a free action at any point in turn (once per turn).
