### 1. Lore & Objective

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game is played over **three rounds**, ending each time the last tile of a numbered pile (#1, #2, #3) is placed.

#### Turn Order
- The player whose **chieftain is rearmost** on the chain takes the next turn.
- That player may move their chieftain to **any tile on the chain** and take it.
- After completing their turn, if they are still rearmost, they take **another turn**.

#### Turn Sequence
1. **Take a Tile**: Move your chieftain to any tile on the chain and take it.
2. **Pay Cost & Place Tile**:
   - Pay any placement cost (shown top-left).
   - Tile must:
     - Share a full side with an existing tile.
     - Be adjacent (including diagonally) to at least one clansman.
     - Match road and river lines from the start tile (road east-west, river north-south).
   - If you cannot place the tile, **discard it** and move a clansman 1 space.
3. **Claim One-Time Bonuses**:
   - Receive immediate benefits (e.g., resources, clansmen, coins) as shown on tile.
   - For **Castles** and **Lochs**, take the matching Special Tile Card.
4. **Activate Tiles**:
   - Activate the **newly placed tile** and **all adjacent tiles** (including diagonals), in any order.
   - Each tile’s benefit is used **once per activation** and is **optional**.
5. **Refill the Chain**:
   - Remove and return to the box any tiles **behind the rearmost chieftain**.
   - Refill empty spaces clockwise from the lowest-numbered available pile.
   - Leave **one space empty** behind the rearmost chieftain.

> **2–3 Players**: After real players’ turns, the **ghost player** rolls the die and advances that many spaces (skipping occupied spaces). The tile landed on is **removed from the game**. Refill accordingly.

- **Selling**: Return resource to supply; take largest coin stack available.
- **Whiskey and clansmen cannot be traded**.

#### Clan Movement & Chieftains
- Each **grey tile activation** grants 1 movement (move 1 clansman 1 space).
- Multiple activations = multiple moves (same or different clansmen).
- A movement may be used to **promote a clansman to Chieftain**:
  - Remove from board; place beside tableau.
  - Counts toward scoring.
  - Cannot promote if only 1 clansman remains (must keep at least 1).

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Interim Scoring (after #1, #2, #3 decks are exhausted)
Players score in **three categories**:
1. **Whiskey Barrels**
2. **Chieftains + Bonnets (Caps)** (from Cawdor, Castle of Mey, etc.)
3. **Special Tile Cards**

For each category:
- Compare to the player with the **fewest** in that category.
- Score **1 VP per unit above** the lowest.
- Example: Whiskey counts 2, 4, 7 → 0/2/5 VP → award 0/2/5 → final scores: 0, 2, 8 VP.

> **Castle of Mey**: Chieftains count **double** during scoring.

#### Final Scoring
Add:
- All VP from interim scoring
- **1 VP per coin**
- **VP from endgame cards**:
  - Duart Castle: 3 VP per **village**
  - Loch Morar: 2 VP per **green tile**
  - Iona Abbey: 2 VP per **yellow tile**
- **VP from cards held** (e.g., Cawdor = 3 bonnets)
- **Penalty**: Lose **3 VP per tile** beyond the smallest tableau.
  - Example: Tableau sizes 13, 15, 16 → penalties: 0, 6, 9 VP

**Winner**: Most total VP.  
**Tiebreaker**: Most resources; if still tied, shared victory.
