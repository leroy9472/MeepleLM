### 3. Setup  
1. Give each player:  
   - 1 tile reserve board  
   - 1 starting tile (place it on the scoring board; place a colored counter on it to mark ownership)  
2. Place building tiles into a bag. Draw 4 at random and place them face-up on the market board.  
3. Shuffle money cards and deal to each player until their total value is **at least 20**.  
4. Place 4 money cards face-up next to the market board.  
5. Divide the remaining money deck into 5 equal piles:  
   - Insert the **1st scoring card into the 2nd pile**  
   - Insert the **2nd scoring card into the 4th pile**  
   - Stack the piles with the **5th pile on the bottom**, then 4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st on top  
6. Determine starting player:  
   - Player with **fewest money cards** starts  
   - Tiebreaker: **lowest total money value**  
   - Play proceeds clockwise  

For 2-player game:  
- Remove 1 of each money card denomination  
- Introduce imaginary player "Dirk" who starts with 6 tiles and participates in scoring  
  - After 1st scoring: Dirk gains 6 more tiles  
  - After 2nd scoring: Dirk gains 1/3 of remaining tiles (round down)  
- Players may give newly bought tiles to Dirk instead of placing them

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn:  
1. **Replenish** face-up money cards and building tiles (if any were taken on previous turn)  
   - Replace money cards from deck; if empty, shuffle discard pile  
   - Replace building tiles from bag  
2. **Take one main action**:  
   a) **Take Money**  
      - Take **one face-up money card**, OR  
      - Take **multiple cards** if their **total value ≤ 5** (any currencies)  
   b) **Buy a Tile**  
      - Pay **exact or more** than the price shown, using **only the currency type** specified next to the tile  
      - **No change is given**  
      - If **exact amount is paid**, the player takes an **extra turn immediately** (same player acts again; no replenishment between turns)  
      - Place the tile on reserve board or into Alhambra at end of turn  
   c) **Redesign Alhambra** (choose one):  
      - Move 1 tile from **reserve to Alhambra**  
      - Move 1 tile from **Alhambra to reserve**  
      - **Swap** 1 tile between Alhambra and reserve  
      - The **starting tile may never be moved**  
3. **Place New Tiles** (after action):  
   - Any newly bought tile must be placed **on reserve board or in Alhambra**  
   - If placed in Alhambra, must follow placement rules (see below)  
4. **End of Turn**:  
   - Replenish money and tiles if needed  
   - Next player clockwise takes turn

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Tile Placement Rules (when adding to Alhambra):  
- Tiles **cannot be rotated**  
- Adjacent sides must **match wall-to-wall or non-wall-to-non-wall** (walls must align)  
- Tile must be **connected by at least one full side** (not just corner)  
- Must be **accessible from the starting tile (fountain)** without crossing a wall  
- Cannot create **enclosed empty spaces** (no holes surrounded on all sides by tiles)  

#### Money & Market:  
- Each building tile requires a **specific currency** for purchase (e.g., Aqua tile may require Red money)  
- Players can hold any mix of currencies  
- Face-up money cards are limited to 4; replenish after each turn  

#### Extra Turn:  
- Triggered only by **paying exact amount** when buying a tile  
- Player performs **another full turn** (replenish not done between)  
- After extra turn, normal play resumes

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Scoring Rounds:  
There are **three scoring phases**:  
1. After the **first scoring card** is drawn from money deck  
2. After the **second scoring card** is drawn  
3. When there are **not enough tiles left** to refill the 4 market spots  

Scoring occurs **after the current player’s turn ends**.  

#### Scoring Categories:  
- **Most tiles of each building type** (6 types):  
  - 1st round: 1st place gets points equal to number of tiles, 2nd place gets nothing  
  - 2nd round: 1st place gets points, **2nd place gets 2 points**  
  - 3rd round: 1st place gets points, **2nd gets 2, 3rd gets 3**  
  - Only tiles **in Alhambra** count; reserve tiles **do not count**  
- **Longest external wall**:  
  - Each player scores **1 VP per wall segment** in their **longest continuous outer wall**  
  - Only **outer perimeter walls** count (not internal walls)  

#### Tie Rules:  
- For building majority:  
  - Combine point values of tied positions and **share equally, rounded down**  
  - Example: Two players tie for 1st (worth 8 and 0): (8+0)/2 = 4 points each  

#### Final Phase (End Game):  
- When market cannot be replenished to 4 tiles:  
  1. **Remaining tiles in bag** are distributed:  
     - Each tile type is given to the player(s) who have **spent the most of that tile’s required currency**  
     - If tied, **no one gets the tile**  
     - Players may immediately **add these tiles to their Alhambra** (if legal)  
  2. **Third and final scoring** occurs  

#### Winning:  
- Player with **most VPs wins**  
- **Tie: no tiebreaker** — players tie for victory
