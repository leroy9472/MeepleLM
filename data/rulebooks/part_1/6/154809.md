### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise starting with the randomly chosen first player.  
- On a turn, a player must either:  
  1. **Take a Worker** from an Action slot, or  
  2. **Consolidate** (if unable or unwilling to take a worker).  

#### Taking a Worker:  
- Take 1 worker from an Action slot and place it in the leftmost empty Worker slot on your player board.  
- Perform the action associated with that Action slot (regardless of worker color).  
- You may have at most 6 workers on your board. If full, you **must** Consolidate on your next turn.  

#### Refilling Action Slots:  
- After taking a worker, if the Action slot is now empty:  
  - Move workers from the topmost non-empty Worker row to refill the Action slot.  
- If all Worker rows are empty:  
  1. Refill all Action slots with 3 workers each from the bag.  
  2. Refill Worker rows:  
     - 4-player: 5 rows  
     - 3-player: 3 rows  
     - 2-player: 2 rows  
  3. Move the scoring marker 1 step to the right.  
     - If it passes a scoring symbol, conduct an Intermediate Scoring.  
     - If it reaches the first golden slot, each player gets exactly 3 more turns before the game ends.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions (performed when taking a worker):  
- **Invest**: Pay 6,000 Yen to build 1 Factory. Must meet Knowledge requirement (can use Blueprints to supplement). Only 1 Factory per good type allowed.  
- **Machinery**: Pay 5,000 Yen per improvement (1–3). Install a +1 tile or flip a +1 to +2 on a Factory.  
- **Produce**: Run 1–3 Factories. Discard required Coal, take 1 Good per Factory, plus extras for +1/+2 Machinery.  
- **Knowledge**: Pay 1,000 / 3,000 / 6,000 Yen to advance 1 / 2 / 3 steps on Knowledge track (max at top).  
- **Mines**: Pay 1,000 / 3,000 / 6,000 Yen to advance 1 / 2 / 3 steps on Coal track (max at top).  
- **Trains**: Pay 5,000 Yen per Train. Place on empty Train/Ship slot. If >1 built, must be in different regions.  
- **Ships**: Pay 5,000 Yen per Ship. Place on empty Train/Ship slot. If >1 built, must be in different regions.  
- **Export**: Fulfill 1–3 contracts by discarding required Goods. Flip contract face down, gain bonus (Yen or VP), and advance Money marker as shown.  
- **Local Market**: Place 1–3 Influence tiles in one region. For each:  
  - Discard 1–3 Goods of one type from a single Factory.  
  - Place Influence tile in a matching city slot (empty or higher value).  
  - Return lower-value tile to owner if displaced.  
  - Receive region bonus immediately.  
  - In 2/3-player games, max 2/3 Influence tiles per city.  
- **Consolidate**: (See below)

#### Consolidate (must do if unable to take worker or have 6 workers):  
1. **Budget**: Discard all Yen and Coal in Budget area. Gain new Yen and Coal based on Money and Coal track levels.  
2. **Emperor’s Reward**: If you have ≥3 workers on your board, take a Reward tile of level ≤ the level shown above your rightmost worker.  
   - If no tiles available, take a 2× VP Multiplier tile instead.  
   - Immediately place Reward or Multiplier on an empty Achievement space.  
3. **Workforce**: Pay 3,000 Yen per **different color** of worker on your board.  
   - For each color unpaid, lose 2 VP.  
   - Return all workers to the bag.

#### Special Rule: Blueprints  
- At any time during your turn, discard 3 Blueprints to advance 1 step on **Money**, **Coal**, or **Knowledge** track.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Intermediate Scoring (3 times during game):  
- Triggered when scoring marker passes a symbol.  
- For each region:  
  - Player influence = sum of Influence tiles + value of Trains (only if at least 1 Influence tile present).  
  - Overseas Companies count as a player: influence = sum of numbers on empty Influence slots in the region.  
- Award VPs based on table on board for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place.  
- In case of tie: combine VPs for tied positions, divide evenly, round down.  
- **Bonus**: Players with most and second-most influence also gain VP from their Ships (as shown on Ship tiles).  

#### Final Scoring (after 3rd Intermediate Scoring):  
1. **Budget & Workforce**:  
   - Discard all Yen.  
   - Gain Yen based on Money track level.  
   - Pay 3,000 Yen per different worker color on board.  
   - Lose 2 VP for each color unpaid.  
2. **Achievements**: Score each Achievement space:  
   - Base VP × Multiplier  
   - Multiplier rules:  
     - No multiplier and no Reward tile → 0  
     - 1× shown and no Reward tile → multiplier = 1  
     - Reward tile present → multiplier = number on tile  
   - Achievement types:  
     - 1 VP per 2 fulfilled contracts  
     - 1 VP per Star reached on Knowledge track (Paper Factory star counts)  
     - 1 VP per Star reached on Coal track (Bento Factory star counts)  
     - 1 VP per level-2 or level-3 Factory  
     - 1 VP per 6,000 Yen in Budget (after final Budget step)  
     - 1 VP per Star above empty Ship space on player board  
     - 1 VP per Star above empty Train space on player board  
     - 1 VP per region with your Influence tile (Trains don’t count)  
     - 1 VP per Factory with +2 Machinery tile  

#### Winning:  
- Highest total VP wins.  
- Tiebreaker: player who acted later in the final round wins (i.e., closest clockwise to last player).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you have multiple Factories of the same good?**  
  No. Only 1 Factory tile per good type allowed.  

- **What happens when you reveal the Trains/Ships symbol?**  
  When both Train and Ship tile are removed from a column on your board, revealing the symbol:  
  - Move Money marker up 1 step (normal)  
  - **Silk Factory special**: Move 2 steps instead (retroactive — apply to all previously revealed symbols).  

- **Can you place Influence tiles without matching goods?**  
  No. Must discard Goods of the type shown on the city section where placing.  

- **Do Ships contribute to influence during scoring?**  
  No. Ships only provide bonus VP during Intermediate Scoring. Influence is from Influence tiles + Trains (if at least one tile present).  

- **Can you use joker cubes from Clocks Factory for any contract?**  
  Yes. Cubes placed next to contracts (from Trains action with Clocks Factory) can be used as any good type during Export.  

- **Can you stack multiple 2× Multiplier tiles?**  
  Yes. Light Bulbs Factory allows placing a 2× tile even if space already has a Reward or another 2× tile. Both multipliers apply.
