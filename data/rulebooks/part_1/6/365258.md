## WORLD WONDERS — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

The game ends after 10 rounds or when any player reaches the end of their Population Track.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Main Board (with reverse side for scoring)  
- 2 Player Expansion Boards (used in 4–5 player games)

B. Shuffle Building Tiles by type and place stacks face down on designated spots. Reveal top tile of each stack and place it below the board.  
C. Place 1st and 2nd Player Turn Order Pedestals on their spaces.  
D. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
- 1 Map Board (all use same side: A or B)  
- 1 Resource Board (same side as Map Board)  
- 1 Long Road Tile (to be placed on first turn)  
- 1 Player Marker

  - Food, Ceramics, Gears, Population → start at '0'  
  - Gold → start at '7'  

E. Randomly assign Player Markers to Turn Order Track.  
F. Place Road Tiles next to board based on player count:  
- 1–2 players: 1 Long, 1 Set of Short Roads  
- 3 players: 2 Long, 1 Set of Short Roads  
- 4 players: 2 Long, 2 Sets of Short Roads  
- 5 players: 3 Long, 2 Sets of Short Roads  

G. Place 1 Tower next to board.  
H. Place 1 Loan Tile per player next to board.  
I. Shuffle Monument Cards, reveal top 3 face up with corresponding Monuments.  
J. Reveal 3 Public Objective Cards face up.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of player turns in Turn Order. Players spend Gold to purchase items until all have spent all their Gold. Then, the round ends and a new one begins. The game lasts up to 10 rounds or ends when any player reaches the final space on their Population Track.

**Each Turn:**  
1. **Purchase one item** (must spend Gold):  
   - 1 Long Road Tile = 1 Gold  
   - 1 Set of Short Road Tiles = 1 Gold  
   - 1 Building Tile = cost on stack (3–5 Gold)  
   - 1 Tower = 2 Gold  
   - 1st/2nd Player Turn Order Pedestal = 1 Gold  
   - 1 Monument = spend **all remaining Gold** (minimum 1 Gold)  

2. **Place purchased item(s)** immediately according to placement rules.  
3. **Optional free action**: Take a Loan (gain +2 Gold this round only) OR pay off existing Loan (cost 3 Gold in future rounds).  
   - Only one Loan allowed at a time.  
   - Loan taken: take Loan Tile, gain 2 extra Gold (max 9 Gold/round).  
   - Loan repaid: return Tile, pay 3 Gold (can do this even after repaying, if still have Gold, must still purchase an item).  

4. If Gold reaches 0, player is out of the round.  
5. If a player cannot afford any item, their round ends.  

**End of Round:**  
1. Discard all unpurchased Building Tiles.  
2. Reveal new Building Tile from each stack.  
3. Replace all purchased Road Tiles (according to player count).  
4. Replace Tower if purchased.  
5. Return 1st/2nd Pedestals to board; place owning players at front of Turn Order.  
6. Remaining players ordered by:  
   - Population (lowest to highest)  
   - Tiebreaker: fewest Monuments  
   - Still tied: maintain relative order from previous round  
7. Reset all players’ Gold Markers to '7'.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

**Turn Order:**  
- Determined at start randomly.  
- After each round:  
  - Pedestal holders go first (1st, then 2nd).  
  - Others ordered by Population (low to high), then Monuments (low to high), then previous order.  

**Placement Rules:**  
- **Road Tile**: Must be adjacent to:  
  - Another Road Tile  
  - Sidewalk (bottom edge of Map Board)  
  - Tower  
  - (Short Roads can be placed separately if each meets adjacency)  
- **Long Road Tile**: Can cross water, but must start and end on land. Flip to Bridge side when doing so.  
- **Tower**: Must be on land, adjacent to any previously placed item (Road, Building, Monument, Tower).  
- **Building Tile**: Must be on land, adjacent to:  
  - A Road Tile, OR  
  - A Building of the same type (color)  
  - Can be rotated.  
- **Monument**: Follow specific card requirements:  
  - Terrain type (land, water, etc.)  
  - Adjacency to specific features (e.g., Road, Library, Water)  
  - Orientation and component placement  
  - Must spend **all remaining Gold** to purchase  
  - Immediately draw new Monument Card to replace  

**Resource & Population Tracking:**  
- When purchasing a **Building** or **Monument**, advance Resource Markers (Food, Ceramics, Gears) as shown on tile/card.  
- Each time a Resource Marker passes a **Population symbol** ( ), advance Population Marker 1 space.  
- Gold Marker moves left as Gold is spent. Resets to 7 each round.  

**Natural Resources:**  
- Treated as land spaces. Can be built on, but leaving them visible may score VP.  

**MUNDO MODE (Optional):**  
- Use separate Mundo Card deck.  
- Reveal 2 from Monument deck and 2 from Mundo deck.  
- If one deck runs out, reveal 3rd card from remaining deck.  
- At end: Score 1 VP for each Mundo Card **not fulfilled** OR score VP listed for each **fulfilled**.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game Ends:**  
- After 10 rounds, OR  
- At end of round when any player reaches final space on Population Track.  

**Final Scoring (use reverse of Main Board to track):**  
1. **Population**: 1 VP per Ring reached on Population Track.  
2. **Least Produced Resource**: VP equal to value of lowest of Food, Ceramics, Gears tracks.  
3. **Monuments**: 1 VP per Ring shown on collected Monument Cards.  
4. **Natural Resources**: 1 VP per **visible** Natural Resource adjacent to at least one placed item.  
5. **City Districts**: 1 VP per Building Tile **completely surrounded** on all sides by:  
   - Other Buildings, Roads, Monuments, Towers, Natural Resources, Water, Sidewalk, or Map Edge  
   - Green (empty) spaces do **not** count as surrounding  
6. **Public Objectives**:  
   - Awarded based on 3 face-up cards  
   - 1st place: score indicated VP  
   - 2nd place: score indicated VP (if specified)  
   - Tie for 1st: sum 1st and 2nd place VP, divide evenly (round up)  
   - Tie for 2nd: each tied player gets 1 VP  
7. **Loans**: Lose 2 VP if holding unpaid Loan.  
8. **Mundo Cards**: Score either 1 VP per **unmet** requirement OR VP listed for each **met** requirement.  

**Winning:**  
- Highest VP wins.  
- Tiebreaker: most Monuments.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build on Natural Resources?** Yes, they count as land.  
- **Can I place a Building adjacent only to another of same type?** Yes, even without a Road.  
- **Can I place a Road over water?** Only Long Road as Bridge (must start/end on land).  
- **What if I can’t afford anything?** Your round ends.  
- **Can I take a Loan after spending Gold?** Yes, as long as you haven’t spent all Gold yet.  
- **Do I get Resources when buying a Monument?** Yes, immediately, as shown on card.  
- **Can I pay off a Loan and do nothing else?** No — if you still have Gold after repaying, you must purchase an item.  
- **Can two players tie for 1st and 2nd on Public Objective?** No — 1st and 2nd are separate. If tied for 1st, no 2nd is awarded.
