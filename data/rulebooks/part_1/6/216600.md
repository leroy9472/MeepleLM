## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
The goal of Fantastic Factories is to earn the most points by building an efficient industrial empire. Points are scored through two sources:  
- **Prestige (O):** Each built Blueprint card has a prestige value in its top-right corner.  
- **Goods (O):** Factories produce goods (crates) during the game.  

**Final Score = Total Goods Manufactured + Total Prestige from Built Cards**  
In case of a tie:  
1. Most Metal  
2. Most Energy  
3. Most Blueprint cards in hand  
If still tied, players share victory.

The game ends when any player reaches **12+ Goods manufactured** OR has **10+ built cards** in their compound. After triggering, finish the current round and play **one additional full round**.

2. **Components**  
- 4 sets of 4 colored dice (red, blue, green, purple, yellow) – player workers  
- 8 frosted white dice (used in solo mode and when extra dice are needed)  
- 54 Energy tokens  
- 42 Metal tokens  
- 42 (1) Goods tokens  
- 42 (2) Goods tokens  
- 4 Tool Label Tokens (mark Contractor columns)  
- 74 Blueprint cards  
- 17 Contractor cards  
- 5 Headquarters player boards  
- 5 Player aid cards  
- 1 Solo player aid card  
- 1 First Player Token (factory-shaped)

All components are unlimited. Use substitutes if supply runs out.

3. **Setup**  
1. Choose a starting player; give them the First Player Token.  
2. Shuffle Blueprint and Contractor decks separately.  
3. Place both decks vertically on the table; flip 4 cards from each to form two 4-card face-up rows: the **Marketplace**.  
4. Place one Tool Label Token above each of the 4 Contractor cards in the Contractor row (symbols determine required discard for hiring).  
5. Each player takes:  
   - 4 dice of one color (not white)  
   - 1 Headquarters board  
   - 1 Player aid card  
   - 1 Metal, 2 Energy  
   - 4 random Blueprint cards (starting hand)  
6. Form a shared supply of Metal, Energy, Goods, and white dice.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Each round has two phases:  
1. **Market Phase** (turn-based, clockwise from start player)  
2. **Work Phase** (simultaneous)  
After each round:  
- Discard down to 10 cards in hand and 12 total resources (Metal + Energy)  
- Pass First Player Token clockwise  
Game ends when end condition is met → play one final round.

5. **Core Mechanics**  

**Market Phase**  
On your turn, choose **one** of:  
- **Gain a Blueprint:** Take any face-up Blueprint card from the Marketplace for free. Refill from Blueprint deck.  
- **Hire a Contractor:**  
  - Discard a Blueprint from your hand matching the **Tool Symbol** above the Contractor’s column.  
  - Pay any additional cost (top-left of card).  
  - Execute the Contractor’s effect, then discard the card.  
  - Refill from Contractor deck.  

**Optional Action (before your main action):**  
Pay 1 Metal **or** 1 Energy to discard **all 4 cards** in either the Blueprint row or Contractor row. Refill from respective deck.  
- Only once per turn  
- Cannot clear both rows  

**Work Phase**  
All players:  
1. Roll all dice (including any extra dice from cards).  
2. In any order, perform actions:  

**A. Building Cards**  
- Choose a Blueprint from your hand.  
- Pay cost in top-left:  
  - Discard another Blueprint with **matching Tool Symbol** (O/O/O)  
  - Pay listed Metal/Energy  
- Place built card in your compound (in front of you).  
- **No limit** on number built per turn.  
- **Only one copy** of each card unless text allows otherwise (e.g., Obelisk, Beacon).  
- Built cards can be activated **immediately**.

**B. Basic Actions (via Headquarters Board)**  
Place dice on your HQ board:  
- **Research:** Place any die → draw 1 Blueprint from deck.  
- **Generate:** Place die showing 1, 2, or 3 → gain Energy equal to die value.  
- **Mine:** Place die showing 4, 5, or 6 → gain 1 Metal.  

**Matching Bonus:**  
- If a die matches value of **one other** already placed in the same action area → gain **+1** resource/card.  
- If matches **two others** (three-of-a-kind) → gain **+2**.  
- Dice need not be placed simultaneously.

**C. Activating Cards**  
- Pay all costs on **left side of arrow** → gain all benefits on **right**.  
- Some cards require placing dice.  
- Each card can be activated **once per Work Phase** (tap or shift to indicate).  
- Activation order is free; outputs can chain.  
- Leave dice and Goods on cards for transparency.  
- Workers cannot be reused.

**Extra Dice**  
Cards like Golem, Robot, Hired Hands grant temporary extra dice.  
- Roll them with your set.  
- Must be discarded at end of Work Phase.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
**End Game Trigger:**  
- Any player reaches **12+ Goods manufactured** OR has **10+ built cards** in compound.  
→ Finish current round, then play **one more full round**.  

**Final Scoring:**  
- Sum:  
  - Number of Goods tokens you have  
  - Prestige values of all built cards (top-right corner)  
**Winner = highest total.**  
Tiebreakers:  
1. Most Metal  
2. Most Energy  
3. Most Blueprint cards in hand  

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can I draw from the Marketplace during Work Phase?**  
  No. Drawing is only from the deck unless a card specifies otherwise.  
- **Can I build a card and activate it the same turn?**  
  Yes.  
- **Do Solar Array or Scrap Yard trigger when building themselves?**  
  No. They only trigger when building **other** cards.  
- **Can I use a worker for multiple actions?**  
  No. Each worker (die) can only be used once per Work Phase.  
- **What if a deck runs out?**  
  Reshuffle discard pile to form a new deck.  
- **Can I exceed 12 resources or 10 cards during the turn?**  
  Yes. Discard down during cleanup.  
- **Do prestige points count toward end game?**  
  No. End game is triggered only by **12+ Goods** or **10+ built cards**, not prestige.  
- **Can I hire a Contractor if I can’t pay the additional cost?**  
  No. All costs must be paid.  
- **Can I refresh the Marketplace more than once per game?**  
  Yes, as long as it’s during your Market Phase turn and you pay 1 resource per refresh.
