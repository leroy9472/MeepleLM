## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
You are a junk artist touring cities to build the largest fan base by creating impressive structures from junk pieces. The player with the most fans at the end of the World Tour wins. Each city offers unique ways to earn fans based on structure height, number of pieces placed, or survival mechanics.

2. Components  
- 6 wooden bases  
- 60 fan tokens (30 × 5-fan, 30 × 1-fan)  
- 60 wooden Junk pieces (15 in each of 4 colors)  
- 60 Junk Art cards (1 per junk piece)  
- 15 City cards (including 3 blank for custom cities)  
- 1 Start player/direction of play card  
- 1 Special Star card  
- 3 Cactus cards (for Nashville only)  
- 1 tape measure  

3. Setup  
- Each player receives one base; choose orientation.  
- Shuffle the Junk Art deck and place it within reach. Do not include Cactus or Special Star cards unless required by the city.  
- Place junk pieces in a central supply; place fan tokens and tape measure nearby.  
- First city: Start player is the last person who visited an art exhibition.  
- Subsequent cities: Start player is the one with the fewest fans. Tiebreaker: clockwise order.  
- Remove Nashville and any city cards not supporting player count. Shuffle remaining City cards and reveal 3 faceup (leftmost = first city).  
- Follow specific city setup rules after universal setup.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Each city has unique rules for turns, piece selection, and end conditions.  
- Universal rules apply unless overridden by city-specific rules.  
- Play proceeds according to the direction of play (clockwise, counterclockwise, or simultaneous).  
- Players place pieces onto their structure or a shared structure depending on the city.  
- Fallen pieces are tracked individually.  
- Exhibition ends per city-specific condition.  
- After each city, retain fan tokens and move to the next city, reassigning the Start player.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Placing Pieces:  
  - Active piece: becomes active when picked up.  
  - May use one or two hands; may hold base with one hand.  
  - Piece must not touch the table; can be placed anywhere on base or structure.  
  - May adjust existing pieces during placement as long as they remain in contact with the structure.  
  - If dropping the active piece, may pick it up and retry.  
- Fallen Pieces:  
  - Any piece falling and touching the table is a fallen piece for its owner.  
  - If you cause another player’s pieces to fall, you take those as your fallen pieces.  
  - Players may not touch another player’s structure.  
- Direction of Play:  
  - Varies by city: clockwise, counterclockwise, or simultaneous.  
- Universal End Condition:  
  - Exhibition ends immediately if all Junk Art cards are played.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After final city, player with most fans wins.  
- Tiebreaker: Player who earned the most fans in the last city wins.  
- If still tied, players may share victory or play a tiebreaker in Monaco.  
- Other ties (e.g., rankings within a city) result in tied players receiving the maximum applicable fans.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Dropping the active piece**: You may retry placement. Only counts as fallen if it falls after placement attempt.  
- **Simultaneous play**: All players act at once; timing calls (e.g., "Done!") are resolved by majority consensus. If unclear, all are considered to have placed.  
- **Revealing invalid cards (e.g., already placed piece)**: Discard and reveal next card.  
- **Movement in Montreal**: If pieces fall during player movement, discard them before next round.  
- **Shooting in Nashville**: Ricochets count. Accidental hits penalize shooter: target gains loot and resets structure/cowboy.  
- **Golden Rule**: City-specific rules override universal rules when in conflict.
