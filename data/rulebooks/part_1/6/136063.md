## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Forbidden Desert is a cooperative survival game where players are stranded explorers on a shifting desert planet. The goal is to work together to locate and retrieve the four missing parts of a flying machine, bring them to the launch pad, and have all players reach the unblocked launch pad to escape before being overwhelmed by the storm or dehydration.

All players win if:
- All players are on the launch pad,
- All four flying machine parts are on the launch pad,
- The launch pad is unblocked (has fewer than 2 sand markers).

All players lose if:
- The sandstorm marker reaches the skull and crossbones,
- Any player's canteen marker reaches the skull and crossbones,
- Sand needs to be added to the board but no sand markers are left in supply.

### 2. Components  
- 24 Desert Tiles (5x5 grid with center missing)  
- 8 Sand Markers (light/unblocked side and dark/blocked side)  
- 4 Flying Machine Parts  
- 1 Sandstorm Meter and Holder  
- 3 Storm Cards Types: Wind Blows, Storm Picks Up, Sun Beats Down  
- 1 Storm Deck  
- 1 Equipment Deck (12 Gear cards)  
- 6 Adventurer Cards  
- 6 Player Pawns (with matching character colors)  
- Water Canteen Markers (one per player)  
- Flying Machine Model (for thematic reference)

### 3. Setup  
1. **Desert Tiles**:  
   - Turn all Desert Tiles face down (desert side up).  
   - Shuffle and arrange into a 5x5 grid with the center space empty (this is the storm’s eye).  
   - Orient all tiles so compass directions align (north up).  

2. **Sand Markers**:  
   - Place 8 sand markers on the board in a diamond pattern:  
     ```
     XXSXX  
     XSXSX  
     SXHXS  
     XSXSX  
     XXSXX  
     ```
     (S = sand marker, H = storm eye/empty center)

3. **Game Elements**:  
   - Place the flying machine and four parts next to the board.  
   - Set the sandstorm marker to the starting level based on player count and difficulty.  
   - Place the storm meter in its holder.

4. **Decks**:  
   - Storm Deck: Turn all cards so north arrow points up. Shuffle face down and place beside board with north aligned.  
   - Equipment Deck: Shuffle and place face down.  
   - Adventurer Deck: Shuffle and deal one card to each player.

5. **Players**:  
   - Each player takes a matching-colored pawn and places it on the "crash site" tile (the one with crash ruins on the back).  
   - Each player places their canteen marker at the highest level on their adventurer card.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds clockwise, starting with the **thirstiest player** (lowest canteen level; ties broken randomly). Each turn has two phases:

#### PART I — Perform Up to 4 Actions  
On their turn, a player may take up to 4 actions (any combination, in any order). Each action costs 1 action point.

**Action Types**:
1. **Move** (1 action):  
   - Move pawn to an orthogonally adjacent (up/down/left/right), unblocked tile.  
   - A tile is **unblocked** if it has fewer than 2 sand markers.  
   - Cannot move into the storm’s eye (empty center space).  
   - Climber can move into blocked tiles and carry one other player.

2. **Remove Sand** (1 action per marker):  
   - Remove 1 sand marker from the tile the player is on.  
   - If the current tile is unblocked, may remove sand from an adjacent tile instead.  
   - Removed sand returns to supply.  
   - **Archaeologist** can remove 2 sand markers for 1 action (from same tile).  
   - Cannot clear blocked tunnels from the opposite end.

3. **Excavate** (1 action):  
   - Flip over the tile the player is on **only if** it has **no sand** on it.  
   - Align tile so icons are in lower-right corner relative to north.  
   - Possible tile types:
     - **Well (2 tiles)**: All players on the tile gain 2 water.  
     - **Mirage (1 tile)**: No water gained.  
     - **Gear (12 tiles)**: Draw 1 Equipment card.  
     - **Part Clue (8 tiles)**: Reveals directional clue (N/S or E/W) for one of the four parts. When both clues for a part are revealed, place the part at their intersection.  
     - **Tunnel (3 tiles)**: Allows instant movement between any two excavated tunnel entrances for 1 action.  
     - **Launch Pad (1 tile)**: Final escape location.

4. **Pick Up a Part** (1 action):  
   - Pick up a flying machine part if:
     - Player is on the same tile as the part,
     - The tile is excavated,
     - The tile is unblocked,
   - A player may carry multiple parts.

**Free Actions (any time, no action cost)**:
- **Share Water**: Two players on the same tile may transfer 1 water (one gains, one loses). Cannot exceed max canteen level.
- **Pass Equipment**: Players on same tile may pass 1 Equipment card.
- These can be done even if one or both are buried.

#### PART II — Draw Storm Cards  
After actions, draw a number of Storm Cards equal to the current **sandstorm level**.

1. Reveal cards one at a time, keeping north arrow up.
2. Resolve each card before revealing the next.
3. Discard each card to the Storm Discard Pile (open information).

**Storm Card Types**:
- **Wind Blows**:  
  - Move the number of tiles shown in the indicated direction toward the storm’s eye.  
  - Each moved tile receives **1 additional sand marker**.  
  - If a tile cannot move (edge of board), it stays.  
  - If no sand remains in supply when required, **all players lose immediately**.

- **Storm Picks Up (×3 in deck)**:  
  - Move the sandstorm marker up one level.  
  - If it reaches the skull and crossbones, **all players lose immediately**.

- **Sun Beats Down (×4 in deck)**:  
  - All players **not in a tunnel** and **not under a solar shield** lose 1 water.  
  - Tunnels protect even if blocked.  
  - Solar shield must be deployed **before** this card resolves; cannot react to it.  
  - If any player’s canteen reaches the skull and crossbones, **all players lose immediately**.

**Deck Management**:  
- If the Storm Deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck and continue drawing.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Blocked vs Unblocked Tiles  
- A tile becomes **blocked** when it has **2 or more sand markers**.  
- The second and subsequent markers are placed **X-side up (dark side)**.  
- Blocked tiles cannot be entered by most players (except Climber).  

#### Buried Players  
- A player is **buried** if their tile becomes blocked (≥2 sand).  
- Buried players can only take **Remove Sand** actions until the tile has <2 sand.  
- Teammates can help dig them out.  
- A **buried player can use a Jetpack** (Equipment card) to escape without digging.

#### Tunnels  
- Once both tunnel entrances are excavated, players can move between them for 1 action.  
- Cannot move to a tunnel entrance if it is blocked.  
- Tunnels protect from **Sun Beats Down**.

#### Part Location & Retrieval  
- Each flying machine part has two clue tiles: one gives N/S position, the other E/W.  
- When both clues are revealed, place the part at the intersection.  
- If the intersection is the storm’s eye, place the part in the holder; it appears on the first tile that moves into the eye.  
- The part stays on its tile even if it moves due to wind.

#### Player Powers  
Each adventurer has a unique ability:

- **Archaeologist**: Remove 2 sand markers (from same tile) for 1 action.  
- **Climber**:  
  - Can move into blocked tiles.  
  - Can carry one other player when moving.  
  - Players on same tile as Climber do not become buried when tile is blocked.  
  - Can move off blocked tiles even if buried.  
  - Cannot use Jetpack to move 3 people total.  
- **Explorer**: Can move, remove sand, and use Dune Blaster (equipment) **diagonally**.  
- **Meteorologist**:  
  - May spend 1 action during turn to **look at top X Storm Cards** (X = current storm level), then place one on bottom of deck.  
  - May spend 1 action to **draw 1 fewer Storm Card** at end of turn (max reduction = number of actions spent).  
- **Navigator**:  
  - Can move another player up to 3 unblocked spaces (including tunnels) for 1 action.  
  - Can move Explorer diagonally and Climber into blocked tiles (Climber can carry another).  
  - Cannot move a buried player.  
- **Water Carrier**:  
  - Can take 2 water from **any excavated well** (even with 1 sand) for 1 action.  
  - Can give 1 water to **orthogonally adjacent** player at any time (free action; reduces own water).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
There is no scoring. The game ends immediately when one of the following occurs:

**Win Condition (all players win)**:
- All players are on the **launch pad**,
- The **launch pad is unblocked**,
- All **four flying machine parts** are on the launch pad.

**Loss Conditions (all players lose)**:
- Sandstorm marker reaches skull and crossbones,
- Any player’s canteen reaches skull and crossbones,
- Required sand marker cannot be placed due to supply exhaustion.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you excavate a tile with 1 sand?**  
  No. Excavation requires **zero sand** on the tile.

- **Can the Climber move through a blocked tunnel?**  
  No. Climber can enter blocked tiles, but **cannot cross blocked tunnel entrances**.

- **Can a buried player use equipment?**  
  Yes, except for actions requiring movement or excavation. Jetpack can be used to escape.

- **Does the Solar Shield protect from Sun Beats Down?**  
  Yes, if deployed **before** the card is resolved.

- **Can you pass water between buried players?**  
  Yes, if on the same tile — sharing water is a free action.

- **What happens if a part is on a tile that gets moved?**  
  The part stays on the tile and moves with it.

- **Can the Navigator move the Climber into a blocked tile?**  
  Yes, and the Climber can carry another player (including the Navigator) with them.

- **Can you use equipment during Storm Phase?**  
  Yes, most equipment (e.g., Jetpack, Dune Blaster) can be used at any time, **except** as a reaction to a Storm Card effect. They can be used between resolving cards.
