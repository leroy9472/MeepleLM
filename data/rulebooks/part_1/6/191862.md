## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Imhotep, the legendary architect of ancient Egypt, is credited with designing the first pyramid. In this game, players take on the role of master builders competing over 6 rounds to transport stone blocks via ships to five sacred building sites: Market, Pyramid, Temple, Burial Chamber, and Obelisks. The goal is to strategically deliver stones to these sites to earn the most victory points through immediate, round-end, and final scoring. Victory requires tactical planning, resource management, and adaptability.

2. Components  
- 120 wooden stones (30 each in black, white, brown, gray)  
- 5 double-sided site boards (A and B sides for each of Market, Pyramid, Temple, Burial Chamber, Obelisks)  
- 1 scoring track board  
- 8 ship tokens (with capacities: 4×4, 3×3, 2×2, 1×1; minimum load requirements vary per ship)  
- 4 supply sled tokens (one per player color)  
- 21 round cards (7 for each player count: 2, 3, 4)  
- 34 market cards (10 Statue, 8 Decoration [2 each of 4 types], 7 Entrance-type [2 Sarcophagus, 2 Paved Path, 2 Entrance, 1 extra?], 9 Blue: 2 Lever, 2 Hammer, 3 Sail, 3 Chisel)  

3. Setup  
- Place the 5 site boards in a fixed order: Market (top), Pyramid, Temple, Burial Chamber, Obelisks (bottom). Use A sides for standard play.  
- Place the scoring track to the right of the site boards.  
- Place the 8 ship tokens above the boards.  
- Separate round cards by player count. Use only the 7 cards matching player count (2-, 3-, or 4-player). Randomly remove one; shuffle the remaining 6 and place face down.  
- Shuffle the 34 market cards into a draw pile to the right of the Market board.  
- Each player chooses a color, takes a supply sled, and places one stone of their color on the "0/40" space of the scoring track.  
- Unused colors and stones are returned to the box.  
- Form the stone quarry (central pile of all stones).  
- Starting player receives 2 stones on their sled; next player (left) gets 3, then 4, then 5 for four players.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each of 6 rounds proceeds in phases:  
I. Flip Round Card: Reveal top round card to determine which 4 ships are available (based on iconography). Place them to the left of the site boards.  
II. Set Market Cards: Reveal top 4 market cards face up on the Market board. Refill from discard pile if needed.  
III. Player Turns: Starting with the current first player, players take turns performing exactly one of four actions:  
 a) Get New Stones: Take up to 3 stones from quarry and place on supply sled (maximum 5 stones on sled).  
 b) Place 1 Stone on a Ship: Move one stone from sled to any empty space on any available (unsailed) ship.  
 c) Sail 1 Ship to a Site: Move a ship to a site board if:  
  - It carries at least the minimum number of stones (shown by gray symbols on bow).  
  - The site has not yet been sailed to this round (only one ship per site per round).  
  Unloading: Remove stones front to back by owner (color), delivering them to the destination site.  
 d) Play 1 Blue Market Card: Use one previously acquired blue card as a full action (instead of a, b, or c).  
IV. End of Round: When all 4 ships have sailed, the round ends immediately.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Turn Order: Continues clockwise until all 4 ships are sailed.  
- Starting Player: The player who sailed the 4th ship does not start next round. Instead, the player to their left becomes the new starting player.  
- Site Mechanics (A sides):  
 A) Market: For each stone delivered, owner immediately takes one face-up market card. Delivered stones return to quarry. Red cards must be played immediately; blue cards are kept for later use; green/purple cards score at endgame.  
 A) Pyramid: Place stones column by column, top to bottom, left to right. First level: 3×3 (1 pt per space). Second level: 2×2 (2 pts per space). Third level: 1 stone (3 pts). Additional stones: 1 pt each (placed at right edge). Points awarded immediately.  
 A) Temple: Place stones left to right, filling levels. Only topmost stones visible earn points (1 pt each) at end of round.  
 A) Burial Chamber: Place stones column by column, top to bottom, left to right. At end of game, score connected groups (orthogonal only): 1=1, 2=3, 3=6, 4=10, 5=15, 6+=17 +2 per additional. Multiple groups per player count.  
 A) Obelisks: Each player builds a separate tower in their color. Endgame scoring by rank:  
  - 2 players: 1st=10, 2nd=1  
  - 3 players: 1st=12, 2nd=6, 3rd=1  
  - 4 players: 1st=15, 2nd=10, 3rd=5, 4th=1  
  Ties: Total points divided among tied players, rounded down. Must have ≥1 stone to score.  
- Blue Market Cards:  
 Lever: Sail a ship and choose unloading order. Unused = 1 pt.  
 Hammer: Take 3 stones, then place 1 on a ship. Unused = 1 pt.  
 Sail: Place 1 stone on a ship and sail it. Unused = 1 pt.  
 Chisel: Place 2 stones on one ship or 1 on each of two ships. Unused = 1 pt.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- End of Each Round: Score Temple — 1 point per visible stone.  
- End of Game (after 6 rounds):  
 - Burial Chamber: Score connected groups.  
 - Obelisks: Score by height ranking.  
 - Market Cards:  
  - Statue: 1=1, 2=3, 3=6, 4=10, 5=15, 6+=17 +2 per additional.  
  - Decoration: 1 pt per 3 total stones (own + others) at site.  
  - Unused blue cards: 1 pt each.  
 - Stonemason’s Wager (if used): 5/3 pts for 1st/2nd on most-stoned site; 3/0 for 1st/2nd on second-most. Ties: 3 pts to 1st-place bettors only.  
- Final Tiebreaker: Most stones on supply sled. If still tied, players share first place.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I sail a ship with no stones of my color? Yes, as long as minimum load is met and site is free.  
- What if I can’t take 3 stones during “Get New Stones”? Take only what fits on your sled (max 5).  
- Can I play a blue card and do another action? No. Playing a blue card is a full action.  
- What if the market draw pile is empty? Shuffle discard pile to form a new draw pile.  
- Can a site receive more than one ship per round? No. Once a site is sailed to, it’s closed for the round.  
- What happens to ships after a round? Return all 4 ships to the general pool.  
- Unused market cards on board? Discard them at round end.  
- Can I use a blue card on the same turn I draw it? Yes, if drawn via Market action.
