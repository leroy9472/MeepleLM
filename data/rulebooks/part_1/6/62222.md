### 4. Gameplay Flow  
**I. Command Phase**  
- Play a Command Card OR discard a Tactician Card for its Default Action (reposition Leader up to 3 hexes).  
- May play multiple Tactician Cards, but only one per unit/leader per side per turn.  
- Second Tactician Card played overrides the first.  

**II. Order Phase**  
- Use Command Card symbols to order matching units/leaders.  
- Units with attached Leader count as one unit.  
- A Leader may detach from unit if played with: Bicorne, Leadership, La Grande Manoeuvre, or Élan card (flag roll on Élan allows detachment).  
- Infantry in Square may only be ordered to exit Square (if no enemy cavalry adjacent).  
- A Leader in Square may not detach.

**III. Movement Phase**  
- Only ordered units and leaders may move.  
- Move units one at a time; no repositioning after next unit moves.  
- Only one unit per hex; only one leader per hex (may co-occupy with a unit).  
- Leaders may move through friendly units; units may not.  
- Units must stop when entering Forest, Walled Garden, or Sandy Quarry.  
- Infantry in Square may not move if adjacent to enemy cavalry.  
- Squares cannot retreat—lose blocks instead.

**IV. Combat Phase**  
#### Ranged Combat  
- Only Infantry and Artillery may perform ranged combat.  
- Target must be within range and line of sight; no adjacent enemy units.  
- Base dice = number of blocks in firing unit.  
- If unit moved, dice halved:  
  - **French**: Round up  
  - **British/Portuguese**: Round down  
- Apply Command Card modifiers, then terrain reductions.  
- Target does not Battle Back.  
- Cavalry may not Retire/Reform before ranged attack.  
- Lone Leader cannot be targeted in ranged combat.

#### Melee Combat  
- Attacking unit must be adjacent.  
- Resolve each melee fully (including Battle Back, Take Ground, Breakthrough, Bonus Attack) before next attack.  
- Declare **Cavalry Retire and Reform (R&R)** before attacker rolls. If declared:  
  - Cavalry retreats 2 hexes.  
  - Attacking infantry rolls normal dice, but only **Cavalry symbols** score hits.  
  - Infantry may **Take Ground** into vacated hex.  
- **Infantry Forming Square**:  
  - May form Square when attacked by Cavalry (if not on Buildings or across Field Works).  
  - Requires discarding a random Command Card to Square Track.  
  - Square attacks first with 1 die; Cavalry attacks with 1 die.  
  - Flags cannot be ignored; no retreat—lose 1 block per flag.  
  - Cannot form Square during Battle Back or against First Strike.  
- **Battle Back**:  
  - If defender survives without retreating, it may counterattack.  
  - Battle Back attacker cannot Take Ground, Break Through, or make Bonus Attack.  
- **Combined Arms Melee**:  
  - Ordered Artillery with LOS may add dice to adjacent infantry/cavalry melee.  
  - Artillery dice hit on Sabres (if supported unit can use sabres).  
  - Artillery cannot fire over friendly units (except hill exception).  
  - If cavalry bounces from Square, artillery support is lost.  

#### Additional Combat Actions  
- **Infantry Taking Ground**: Victorious melee attacker (eliminates or forces retreat) may move into vacated hex.  
- **Cavalry Breakthrough**: After successful melee, cavalry may move into vacated hex + 1 additional hex.  
- **Cavalry Bonus Attack**: After Breakthrough, cavalry may make a second melee attack (subject to terrain).  

**V. Draw Phase**  
- Draw Command Cards to replenish hand only if instructed by played Command Card.  
- No limit on number of Tactician Cards held.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Leader Rules  
- **Attached Leader**: Unit ignores first Flag.  
- **Leader Casualty Check**:  
  - **Unit loses block**: Defender rolls 2 dice; Leader eliminated on **2 Sabres**.  
  - **Unit eliminated**: Defender rolls 1 die; Leader eliminated on **1 Sabre**.  
  - **Lone Leader attacked**: Attacker rolls 1 die; Leader eliminated on **1 Sabre**, else retreats 1–3 hexes.  
- **Lone Leader**:  
  - Counts as Support.  
  - May be attacked in melee only.  
  - Must retreat 1–3 hexes if not eliminated.  
  - May reposition up to 3 hexes via Tactician Card Default Action.  

#### Terrain Effects  
- **Forest / Walled Garden / Sandy Quarry**:  
  - Must stop when entered.  
  - No combat the turn of entry (exceptions: Light Infantry, Rifle Lt, Young Guard).  
  - Sandy Quarry: impassable to Artillery.  
- **Hill**: No movement penalty. Ranged fire from hill to hill: -1 die.  
- **Field Works (Clear, Orchard, Hill, Forest)**:  
  - Units ignore 1 Flag.  
  - May form Square if attacked via non-fieldwork hexside (Hill/Forest with Field Works).  
- **Rugged Hill**: Impassable.  
- **Artillery on Hill**: May fire over adjacent friendly unit/leader on lower level.  

#### National Special Rules  
- **British**:  
  - All Infantry: +1 die in Ranged Combat (if moved: half dice, rounded down).  
  - Grenadiers, Guard Heavy Cavalry: +1 die in Melee.  
  - Grenadiers: ignore 1 Retreat.  
  - Guard Grenadiers, British Guard Heavy Cavalry: ignore 2 Retreats.  
- **French**:  
  - Light Infantry, Young Guard, Old Guard: +1 die in Ranged (moved: round up).  
  - Line Infantry vs Infantry: +1 die in Melee.  
  - Young Guard, Grenadiers, Guard Foot Artillery: +1 die in Melee.  
  - Old Guard Infantry: +2 dice in Melee.  
  - Heavy Cavalry, Cuirassiers, Guard Heavy Cavalry: +1 die in Melee.  
  - Young Guard, Grenadiers, Cuirassiers: ignore 1 Retreat.  
  - Old Guard, Guard Light Cavalry, Guard Heavy Cavalry: ignore 2 Retreats.  
- **Prussian Iron Will**: Spend 1 counter to ignore a Flag.  
- **Russian Guard Foot Artillery**: Only nationality with this unit type.  
- **Battalion Mass (French)**: Line Infantry may form Square without committing a Command Card.

#### Morale (Flag Ignoring)  
A unit may ignore the first Flag if:  
- Leader attached  
- Grenadier, Cuirassier, or Guard unit  
- Adjacent to 2+ friendly units or leaders (does not apply in Square)  
- On terrain that grants flag immunity (e.g., Field Works, Walled Garden)  

#### Garrison  
- Ordered Infantry (2+ blocks) moving from Building or Walled Garden may create 1-block Garrison.  
- Garrison:  
  - Cannot move.  
  - Battles with 1 die (no national modifiers).  
  - Eliminated if forced to retreat.  
  - Does not count as Victory Banner.  
  - May occupy Victory Banner hex.  
  - Removed when friendly unit enters hex.

#### Tactician Cards  
- Start with indicated number. Draw more only when Command Card allows.  
- May play multiple per turn, but only one per unit/leader per side.  
- Second played card overrides first.  
- Terrain effects apply unless card specifies otherwise.  
- **Default Action**: Discard to move a Leader up to 3 hexes (terrain costs apply).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Victory determined by scenario: typically by capturing a set number of Victory Banner hexes.  
- Each Victory Banner hex captured awards 1 Victory Banner.  
- Game ends when one player reaches the required number of Victory Banners (per scenario).  
- If time limit reached, player with most Victory Banners wins.
