### 1. Lore & Objective
In the Wild West, bandits rob a train while evading the Marshal. The goal is to become the richest bandit by collecting loot, avoiding bullets, and completing special objectives. If the Marshal is in play, he wins by completing at least four of his five goals; otherwise, the richest bandit wins.

### 2. Components
- Train cars (Locomotive, standard cars, Prison car, Stagecoach, etc.)
- Bandit pawns and character sheets
- Action cards (Move, Fire, Punch, Robbery, etc.)
- Bullet cards (player-specific and neutral)
- Loot tokens (Purses, Jewels, Strongboxes, etc.)
- Round cards (determine turn types and end-of-round events)
- Marshal pawn and goal cards (if in play)
- Special tokens (Whiskey Flasks, Dynamite, etc., depending on variants)

### 3. Setup
1. Choose characters and distribute character sheets, pawns, and starting $250 Purse.
2. Shuffle each player’s action deck and place it face-down; arrange bullet cards by quantity.
3. Assemble the train: Locomotive plus one car per player, randomly ordered.
4. Place loot tokens as indicated on car floors; put Marshal and a Strongbox in the Locomotive.
5. Prepare Round deck: 4 round cards matching player count (2–4 or 5–6) and 1 Train Station card on bottom.
6. Determine first player randomly; they take the Round deck.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the five rounds follows:
1. **Start of Round**: Draw Round card, fill hand (6 cards, 7 for Doc).
2. **Schemin’! Phase**: Players take turns playing action cards face-up (or face-down in tunnels) to the common deck, or draw 3 cards.
3. **Stealin’! Phase**: Flip the common deck and resolve actions in reverse order.
4. **End of Round**: Resolve event on Round card, then pass first player to the left.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Actions**:
  - *Move*: 1 car inside, or 1–3 cars on roof.
  - *Fire*: Shoot adjacent car (inside) or any visible roof target; gives opponent a bullet card.
  - *Punch*: Target in same car drops loot; moved to adjacent car.
  - *Robbery*: Take one loot token from current location.
  - *Change Floor*: Switch between interior and roof.
  - *Marshal*: Move Marshal one car; if he enters a car with bandits, they flee to roof and take a neutral bullet.
- **Line of Sight**: Unobstructed view on roof; adjacent cars only for interior.
- **Special Abilities**:
  - *Ghost*: Play first action card face-down each round.
  - *Belle*: Cannot be targeted by Fire or Punch if others are present.
  - *Cheyenne*: Can take a dropped Purse when punching.
  - *Tuco*: Can shoot through roof to target other floor.
  - *Django*: Target moves one car away when shot.
  - *Doc*: Draws 7 cards per round.
- **Events** (end of round):
  - *Angry Marshal*: Shoots roof bandits, then moves toward caboose.
  - *Swivel Arm*: All roof bandits move to caboose roof.
  - *Braking*: All roof bandits move one car toward locomotive.
  - *Take It All!*: Add a second Strongbox to Marshal’s car.
  - *Passengers’ Rebellion*: All bandits inside cars get a neutral bullet.
  - *Pickpocketing*: Lone bandits take a Purse if available.
  - *Marshal’s Revenge*: Bandits above Marshal lose least valuable Purse.
  - *Hostage-Taking*: Bandits in locomotive get $250.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
After five rounds:
- **Loot**: Add value of all collected tokens (Purses, Jewels, Strongboxes).
- **Gunslinger Prize**: $1000 to player(s) who fired the most bullets (fewest bullet cards left).
- **Tiebreakers**: Fewest bullets received, then pistols at dawn.
- **Marshal Victory**: Wins if at least 4 of 5 goals are met (e.g., captured bandits, empty cylinder, etc.).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **No valid target?**: Fire and Punch actions have no effect.
- **Cannot perform action?**: Action is skipped (e.g., blocked movement).
- **Bullet deck empty?**: Fire actions have no effect.
- **Neutral Bullet deck empty?**: No bullets are given in events or encounters.
- **Ties**: First in loot, then fewest bullets received.
