## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Clash of Cultures*, players lead emerging civilizations through technological, cultural, and military development to become the dominant culture. Victory is achieved by earning the most Victory Points (VPs) at the end of the game.

**Victory Points are scored for:**
- 1 VP per city piece on the board (including Settlements and buildings)
- ½ VP per advance cube
- 5 VPs per Wonder built
- 2 VPs per completed Objective card
- Some Event cards may grant VPs

The game ends after the 6th Round or immediately if a player has no cities remaining. In case of a tie, the tied player who owns the Great Pyramids wins. If still tied, compare VPs in order: city pieces, advances, Wonders, Objectives.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Actions (3 per turn)
**1. Advance**  
- Pay 2 Food (or substitute Ideas or Gold) to place a cube on an advance
- Must take the **top advance** in a new category first
- Some advances have prerequisites (in red text)
- Advances with **yellow outline** increase Happiness level and grant 1 Mood token
- Advances with **blue outline** increase Culture level and grant 1 Culture token
- **Government categories** (Autocracy, Democracy, Theocracy): Only one may be active at a time
   - To switch, pay 2 Food to move cubes to new government tree

**2. Move Units**  
- Move up to 3 different units or groups (land or sea)
- **Land units**: Move 1 space per action
- **Ships**: Move to any connected sea space
- **Battles** resolve immediately upon entering a space with foreign units
- **After battle**, unit cannot move again this turn
- **Mountain**: Unit cannot move again after entering
- **Forest**: Unit cannot move into battle after entering
- **Transport**: Ship can carry 2 land units. Embark/disembark costs 1 movement action
- Must have **Tactics** advance to move Army units

**3. Found City**  
- Replace 1 Settler with a Settlement
- Must be on non-barren land with no other city or foreign unit

**4. Activate City**  
Choose one action per activation:
- **Collect Resources**: Gain up to city size in resources (+1 if Happy, only 1 if Angry)
   - Collect from city space and adjacent spaces (once per space per activation)
   - Cannot collect from spaces with another city or foreign units
- **Build Units**: Build up to city size units (+1 if Happy, only 1 if Angry)
   - Army units cost 1 Food; Settlers cost 2 Food; Ships cost 1 Wood, 1 Ore
   - Max 4 Army units per land space
   - Ships can only be built at a Port (adjacent to sea)
- **Increase City Size**: Pay 1 Food, 1 Wood, 1 Ore to add a city piece
   - Requires prerequisite advance (e.g., Port → Building)
   - Angry cities cannot grow
   - City size cannot exceed total number of cities you own
   - Each city can have only one of each building type

**Note**: Activating the same city more than once per turn reduces its mood by one step after each additional activation.

**5. Civic Improvement**  
- Pay Mood tokens equal to city size to increase mood by one step (Angry → Neutral → Happy)
- Can improve multiple cities or multiple steps in one action

**6. Cultural Influence**  
- Target a city (size ≥2) within range of one of your cities
- **Range** = target city’s owner’s city size + 1 per Culture token spent before roll
- Roll a die: Success on 5 or 6
- After roll, spend Culture tokens to add +1 per token
- Success: Replace one non-Settlement city piece in target city with your color
- **Only one success per turn**
- City under Cultural Influence cannot be used as base for influence
- Can target your own city to remove foreign influence
- Works across sea spaces, not through unrevealed regions

#### Combat
- Triggered when units enter space with foreign units
- **Sequence per round**:
  1. Attacker declares use of 1 Action card (if has Tactics); then defender
  2. Reveal and resolve card effects (if prior to roll)
  3. Both players roll dice = number of Army units (Ships in naval combat)
  4. Total dice = Combat Value (CV). Hits = CV ÷ 5 (rounded down)
  5. Remove one unit per hit (defender chooses which)
     - Settlers are auto-eliminated if last unit
     - Units on Ships die if Ship is destroyed
  6. Attacker chooses: retreat to origin or continue fighting
- **Fortress defense**: Rolls 1 die; cancels one hit in first round (only)
- **Barbarians**: Battle lasts only one round. Hits remove units, then city pieces. City becomes Angry if any piece is removed

#### Capturing Cities
- After eliminating enemy units:
  - Replace all city pieces with your color (except those under 3rd-party Cultural Influence)
  - If no matching piece available, remove it and gain 1 Gold
  - If missing Settlement, remove entire city and gain 1 Gold per piece
  - If city was Happy or Neutral: attacker gains Gold = city size; defender gains a Settler
  - Captured city becomes **Angry**
  - Cannot use building powers without prerequisite advance

#### Capturing Barbarian Settlements
- Gain 1 Gold per Barbarian defeated
- Choose: take over city (change to your color, becomes Angry) or raze it (+1 extra Gold)

#### Exploration
- **Land unit entering unrevealed region**:
  1. Cannot enter Sea space
  2. Sea spaces must connect to existing sea
  3. Otherwise, place so Sea touches board edge
- **Ship exploring**:
  - Place region so Ship can reach Sea space
  - If not possible, place normally and return Ship to start
- If region has **Barbarian icon**, place Barbarian settlement and unit on a fertile space (not entry space)

#### Event Cards
- Draw when Happiness or Culture level reaches III, V, or VII
- Resolve immediately
- **Icons (only affect drawer)**:
  - **Gold Mine**: Gain 2 Gold
  - **Exhausted**: Place Exhausted token on empty non-barren land adjacent to your city. No resources or cities allowed
  - **Barbarians Spawn**: Place new Barbarian settlement + unit within 2 spaces of your city. Then add 1 Barbarian to any settlement
  - **Barbarians Attack**: Strongest nearby Barbarian settlement attacks your closest city

#### Trading
- During active player’s turn, others may trade with them
- Tradeable: Resources, Action cards, Objective cards, Mood tokens, Culture tokens
- Immediate trades binding; future promises not enforced

#### Wonders
- Revealed when **Engineering** or **Monuments** advance is taken
- Any player can build by meeting cost and requirements
- Place Wonder token in one of your cities
- Grants special ability
- If city is captured, Wonder goes to new owner
- If city is destroyed, Wonder is lost
