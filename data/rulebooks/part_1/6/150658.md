# Pandemic: The Cure — Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Players are disease-fighting specialists racing against time to contain and cure four deadly diseases threatening the world. The team wins by curing all four diseases. The team loses if the infection rate reaches the skull, 8 or more outbreaks occur, or there are not enough infection dice in the bag during infection.

## 2. Components
- 48 Infection Dice (12 each of 4 colors: red, yellow, blue, black)
- 10 Event Cards
- 1 Cured Diseases Card
- 6 Region Tiles (numbered 1–6)
- 1 CDC Tile
- 1 Treatment Centre Board with:
  - Infection Rate Track (green syringe)
  - Outbreak Track (blue syringe)
- Player Role Cards (with matching colored pawns and player dice)
- Infection Bag

## 3. Setup
1. Place the Treatment Centre in the center. Arrange Region Tiles 1–6 clockwise around it. Place CDC Tile and Cured Diseases Card nearby.
2. Set Infection Rate Track to difficulty level: Beginner (6), Standard (5), Heroic (4).
3. Set Outbreak Track to 0.
4. Place all 48 infection dice into the bag.
5. Draw 12 random infection dice, roll them:
   - Reroll any cross (+) symbols.
   - Place dice in regions matching their number (1–6).
   - If more than 3 dice of one color are in a region, reroll the excess.
6. Shuffle Event Cards and place face down. Reveal 3 face-up.
7. Give each player:
   - One Role Card
   - Matching colored player dice
   - Matching colored pawn (place all in Region 1)
8. Choose a starting player.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
On a player’s turn, perform these steps in order:

### 1. Roll Player Dice and Do Actions (Mandatory)
- Roll all available player dice.
- **Biohazard (☣):** Immediately increase Infection Rate by 1. Set die aside (cannot reroll). If Infection Rate reaches a light green marker, trigger an Epidemic. If it reaches the skull, the team loses.
- **Other Dice:** May reroll any non-Biohazard dice as many times as desired. Once used, a die cannot be rerolled.
- Spend dice to perform actions:
  - **Fly (✈):** Move pawn to any region.
  - **Sail (⛵):** Move pawn to adjacent region.
  - **Treat (💉):**
    - Move 1 infection die from current region to Treatment Centre.
    - OR move 1 infection die from Treatment Centre to bag.
    - If the disease is cured, move **all** dice of that color instead of one.
  - **Collect Sample (🧪):** Take 1 infection die of uncured disease from Treatment Centre and place on your Role Card. Cover it with your player die (bottle icon). Both dice are now "locked" until the disease is cured.
  - **Role-Specific Actions:** See Role Card for special abilities.
- You do not have to use all dice.

### 2. Give Samples (Optional)
- If you have sample(s) on your Role Card, you may give **all samples of one disease** (including the player die used to collect them) to another player in the same region.
- The receiving player places both dice on their Role Card. Samples remain locked.

### 3. Attempt a Cure (Optional, Once per Turn)
- Choose one uncured disease for which you have at least one sample.
- Roll **all** your samples of that color. Cross (+) results count as 0.
- **Success (13+):**
  - Place one infection die on the Cured Diseases Card.
  - Return all player dice used to collect samples to their owners.
  - Return all infection dice of that color (from samples, Treatment Centre, and other players) to the bag.
  - Treat actions now affect all dice of this color.
- **Failure (<13):**
  - Return all dice to your Role Card. Samples remain locked.
  - You may try again later or pass them to another player.

### 4. Infect Regions (Mandatory)
- Draw number of infection dice equal to current Infection Rate from the bag.
- If insufficient dice: **team loses**.
- Roll dice:
  - **Cross (+):** Place in CDC Tile.
  - **Number (1–6):** Place in corresponding region.
- Check each region clockwise for outbreaks.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Outbreak (Occurs if >3 dice of one color in a region)
- Advance Outbreak Track by 1.
- If track reaches skull (8 outbreaks): **team loses**.
- Move excess dice (above 3) to next clockwise region.
- Chain reaction: if the next region now has >3 of that color, repeat.

### Epidemic
Triggered when Infection Rate reaches a light green marker.
- Interrupt current turn.
- Take all dice in Treatment Centre + draw dice equal to current Infection Rate from bag.
- Roll all dice:
  - Cross (+): place in CDC.
  - Number: place in corresponding region.
- Check all regions clockwise for outbreaks (chain reactions possible).
- Resume current player’s turn.

### Events
- Cross (+) dice in CDC pay for Event Cards.
- Any player may use an Event Card at any time (except during dice placement/outbreak checks).
- To use: return required number of cross dice from CDC to bag. Follow card effect.
- Discard used Event Card to bottom of deck. Draw new one to keep 3 face-up.

### Special Rules
- **Locked Dice:** Player dice used to collect samples are locked until the disease is cured.
- **No Dice? Unlock One:** If all your dice are locked, you may unlock one at the start of your turn. Return the infection die to the Treatment Centre and roll the player die.
- **Cured Disease:** Treat actions move all dice of that color. No eradication mechanic.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition:** Cure all four diseases.
- **Lose Conditions (immediate):**
  - Infection Rate reaches skull.
  - Outbreak Track reaches skull (8 outbreaks).
  - Cannot draw enough infection dice during Infect step.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I give samples of multiple diseases?** No. Only all samples of **one** disease per action.
- **Can I attempt a cure with only one sample?** Yes, but unlikely to reach 13.
- **Do cured diseases still cause outbreaks?** No. Only uncured diseases can cause outbreaks.
- **Can I use Event Cards during an Epidemic?** Yes, before or after resolving the Epidemic, but not during dice placement/outbreak checks.
- **What happens to locked dice after a cure?** They are immediately returned to their owners.
- **Can I treat a cured disease from the Treatment Centre to the bag?** Yes, and it removes all dice of that color.
