## Thurn and Taxis – SoloPlay™ Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   In *Thurn and Taxis*, players build postal networks across 18th-century German regions, establishing routes and claiming regional dominance. The SoloPlay™ variant allows one player to compete against the system, aiming to score at least 48 points through strategic route-building, region control, and efficient resource management.

   **Goal**: Score 48 or more victory points. Achieve one of three victory ratings:  
   - 48–53: Minor Victory  
   - 54–59: Major Victory  
   - 60+: Complete Victory

2. **Components**  
   - Game board showing German cities and regions  
   - 80 wooden houses (20 each in 4 colors: blue, green, red, yellow)  
   - 4 principal firm cards (company cards)  
   - 20 coach cards (4 each of values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)  
   - 66 city cards (3 copies each of 22 cities)  
   - 30 bonus tiles:  
     - Distance: 4 × 7-route, 3 × 6-route, 2 × 5-route  
     - Region: 4 × "Outside of Baiern", 4 × Baiern, 3 × Baden, 3 × Wurttemberg/Hohenzollern, 3 × Schweiz/Tyrol, 3 × Bohmen/Salzburg  
     - 1 × "Game End" (Spielende)  
   - 4 summary cards  
   - 4 postal officials (implied via actions)

3. **Setup**  
   - Place the board in the center.  
   - Sort bonus tiles:  
     - Distance tiles (5, 6, 7) in **descending** order (highest on top).  
     - All other bonus tiles in **ascending** order (lowest on top).  
     - Limit to 3 of each type; remove lowest-value extras if needed.  
   - Shuffle city cards to form a draw deck. Draw 6 cards and place faceup on board spaces.  
   - Sort coach cards by value (3–7) and place along top of board.  
   - **Solo Setup Specifics**:  
     - Remove 1 house of each color to use as a route marker. Max 19 houses per color available for placement.  
     - Place these 4 “route houses” on the face-up principal firm card (Route Planner).  
     - Place a second principal firm card face-down nearby (Route Completion space).  
     - Draw 8 unique cities per color (normal difficulty):  
       - For each color, draw city cards one at a time.  
       - Place one house of that color on each city, **only if** the city does **not** trigger a region bonus (i.e., not the last city needed to complete a region).  
       - If a drawn city would complete a region or is a duplicate, set aside and draw again.  
       - Variant difficulties: Easy = 10 cities, Intermediate = 9, Hard = 7.  
     - Reshuffle the city deck after setup.  
   - Prepare two discard piles:  
     - **Discard Pile 1**: For hand limits, failed routes, Administrator use.  
     - **Discard Pile 2**: For completed route cards (used to track endgame scoring).  

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   On each turn, perform the following in order:

   1. **Use One Official (Mandatory)**  
      - Must use exactly one postal official per turn.  
      - Cannot skip this action.

   2. **Draw Cards**  
      - **Normal**: Draw 1 city card (from faceup board or draw deck).  
      - **Postmaster**: Draw 2 cards (both from same source).  
      - If drawing from board, immediately refill with top card from draw deck.

   3. **Play Cards**  
      - Must play 1 city card to:  
        - Start a new route, or  
        - Add to current route (left or right end only).  
      - Card must:  
        - Be connected by road to the end city of current route.  
        - Not already be in the current route.  
      - **Postal Carrier (Coachman)**: Play a second card (if legal).  
      - If unable or unwilling to play legally, discard entire current route and start a new one.

   4. **Complete Route (Optional)**  
      - May complete route if it has **3 or more cards**.  
      - When completing:  
        a. **Declare Color** (if starting route): Place a “route house” on starting city to mark color.  
        b. **Place Houses**:  
           - Option 1: One house in one city per region along the route.  
           - Option 2: One house in each city within **one** region on the route.  
        c. **Claim Bonuses**:  
           - **Distance**: Take top tile from 5-, 6-, or 7-route pile if route length matches or exceeds. If unavailable, take next lower.  
           - **Region**: If all cities in a region (or region pair) now have your house, take top tile from corresponding stack.  
           - **Bonus Scoring Tile**: If you now have **one tile from each province**, take the 1-point "Game End" tile. Then:  
             - Place it on any province stack.  
             - Take the top tile from that stack.  
             - You may continue using this ability each time you complete a region in a stack containing the 1-point tile.  
        d. **Take Coach Card**:  
           - Must take coach card matching **exact route length** (e.g., 5-card route → take Coach 5).  
           - **Cartwright (Wainwright)**: May take coach card if route is **1 or 2 cards short** (e.g., 4-card route → take Coach 5 or 6).  
           - Must take a coach card upon completion. If no matching or eligible coach card exists, **must abandon the route** (discard without scoring).  
        e. **Discard Cards**:  
           - Place all route cards into **Discard Pile 2** (completed routes).  
           - Reduce hand to **3 cards max**; excess go to **Discard Pile 1**.

   5. **Track Color Series**  
      - Must complete one route of **each color** before reusing any color.  
      - After completing a route, move its route house to the **face-down principal firm card** (Route Completion space).  
      - When all 4 colors are used (one route each), move all route houses back to the **face-up card** (Route Planner).  
      - A new series begins; any color may be used.

   6. **Hand Management Bonus**  
      - If you complete a route **and end with 0 cards in hand**, you may:  
        - Take up to 3 cards from the **faceup board cards** and place them in **any order** on the bottom of the draw deck.  

   7. **Refill Board**  
      - After drawing or discarding, refill faceup board cards to 6 using draw deck.  
      - If draw deck runs out, shuffle **Discard Pile 2** (completed route cards) to form a new deck. **Do not** use Discard Pile 1.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Route Building**: Linear sequence of connected cities. Only one active route at a time.  
   - **Color Cycling**: Must complete one route per color (in any order) before repeating a color. Enforces planning and balance.  
   - **Coach Sets**: Collect coach cards (3–7). Score at end based on **consecutive sets** starting at 3:  
     - Set (3,4,5,6,7) = 10 pts  
     - Set (3,4,5,6) = 7 pts  
     - Set (3,4,5) = 5 pts  
     - Set (3,4) = 3 pts  
     - Single (3) = 2 pts  
     - Higher cards without lower ones do not score.  
     - Example: Coaches 3,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6,7 → three sets: (3,4,5,6,7)=10, (3,4,5,6)=7, (3)=2 → Total: 19 pts  
   - **Bonus Scoring Tile**: Special mechanic allowing repeated bonus collection after collecting one of each province’s tile.  
   - **Discard Penalty**: Discarded cards (from hand limits, failed routes, Administrator) cost **1 point per 2 cards discarded**.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   **End Game Conditions (trigger end of game when either occurs)**:  
   - City card supply deck is exhausted (after possible shuffle of Discard Pile 2).  
   - One color of houses is exhausted during route completion.  

   **Final Steps**:  
   - Complete current route if possible.  
   - Discard all incomplete routes.  
   - Place all cards in hand onto **Discard Pile 1** (counted for penalty).  
   - **Do not** score remaining draw deck or board cards.  

   **Final Scoring**:  
   1. **Bonus Tiles**: Sum all collected bonus tiles (distance, region, game end).  
   2. **Coach Sets**: Score maximum possible sets (see above).  
   3. **Remaining Houses**: Total all unused houses (all colors combined):  
      - 3 left = +15 pts  
      - 4 = +10 pts  
      - 5 = +7 pts  
      - 6 = +5 pts  
      - 7 = +2 pts  
      - 8 or 9 = 0 pts  
      - 10+ = –1 pt per house over 8  
   4. **Discard Penalty**: –1 point for every **2 cards** in Discard Pile 1 (round down).  

   **Total Score = Bonus Tiles + Coach Sets + Remaining Houses – Discard Penalty**

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Q: Can I use the same color twice in a row?**  
     A: No. Must complete one route of each of the other three colors first.  
   - **Q: What if I can’t take a coach card when completing a route?**  
     A: You **must abandon the route** (discard it, no points or bonuses).  
   - **Q: Can I use the Hand Management Bonus if I have cards left?**  
     A: No. Only if your hand is **exactly 0** after completing the route.  
   - **Q: What happens when the draw deck runs out?**  
     A: Shuffle **Discard Pile 2** (completed route cards) to form a new deck. Discard Pile 1 is never reshuffled.  
   - **Q: Can I place a house in a city that already has one of my houses?**  
     A: Yes, but you **cannot place a second house** there. The city card can still be played.  
   - **Q: Do I score region bonuses immediately or only when all cities are filled?**  
     A: Region bonuses are claimed **when you complete a route** that gives you the final city needed for the region.
