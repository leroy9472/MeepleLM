#### Roleplay (RP)  
- Gain RP: Guide earns 1 RP when reaching a 一 symbol on a card.  
- Max RP:  
  - 1-exile party: 3 RP  
  - 2-exile party: 2 RP  
  - 3–4 exile party: 1 RP  
- Spend RP: As reaction after rolling an attribute check, spend 1 RP to add +3 to roll.  
- If max RP or symbol not reached, card remains uncleared; RP can be claimed later.  

#### Combo/Threat Tracker  
- Combo ◆: Shared resource. Max 7.  
  - At 7: Spend 7 Combo ◆ as Free action to take an action without paying combo or action cost. Turn resumes.  
- Threat ↓: Shared threat counter. Max 7.  
  - At 7 (Limit Break): After any turn, add 1 Power token (orange gem) to each foe AI card, then activate all foes as if "All Foes" Threat card was drawn.  

#### Power Token  
- Each Power token on foe AI card adds +1 damage ↓ or +1 HP loss on direct HP reduction.

  - Others can move onto KO'd square; KO'd exile moves to adjacent unoccupied traversable square.  
  - Healed to ≥1 HP: Stand up, no longer KO'd.  
- **Surge**: Once per combat, KO'd exile can Surge:
