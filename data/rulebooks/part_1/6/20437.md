## Lords of Vegas: Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Lords of Vegas*, players take on the roles of developers and casino bosses in 1941 Las Vegas, competing to build and control the most profitable and prestigious casinos along the Strip. The game ends when the "End of Game" card is drawn, or immediately if any player reaches 90 or more points. The winner is the player with the most points. In case of a tie, the player with the most money wins.

### 2. Components  
- **Game Board**: Represents the Las Vegas Strip with labeled lots (A1–F9), a scoring track, wager space, and discard areas for property cards.  
- **Casino Tiles (45 total)**: 9 square tiles in each of 5 colors (aqua, brown, gold, purple, silver). Each tile has a central hole to hold a die.  
- **Player Dice (12 per player)**: Colored dice (blue, green, red, yellow) used to claim influence in casinos. Die value indicates influence strength.  
- **Player Markers (10 per player)**: Used to claim ownership of undeveloped lots.  
- **Scoring Chips**: Track each player’s victory points (VPs) on the scoring track.  
- **Money**: Denominations of $1M, $5M, $10M, $20M (all values represent millions).  
- **Property Cards (49 total)**: Each corresponds to a lot on the board. Includes 9 cards per color (aqua, brown, gold, purple, silver), 4 "Pay The Strip" cards, and 1 "End of Game" card.  
- **Player Card**: Indicates the current player.  
- **House Card**: Used during gambling to indicate the active casino.  
- **Action Cards**: Reference cards listing available actions (Build, Sprawl, Remodel, Reorganize, Gamble, Trade).

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player chooses a color and takes:
   - 12 dice
   - 10 markers
   - 1 scoring chip
   - 1 action card
2. Place scoring chips at "0" on the scoring track.  
3. Choose a Banker to manage money.  
4. Remove the "End of Game" card from the deck. Shuffle the remaining 48 property cards and deal 2 to each player.  
5. Players:
   - Place a marker on each lot shown on their 2 cards.
   - Receive money equal to the sum of the $ values on their cards (used only for starting funds).
   - Discard their 2 cards to the appropriate colored discard piles on the board.  
6. Reinsert the "End of Game" card:
   - Divide the remaining deck into 4 roughly equal stacks.
   - Place the "End of Game" card on top of the 4th stack.
   - Stack the other 3 on top of that, so the "End of Game" card is near the bottom (in the last quarter).  
7. Determine first player: Each player rolls 2 dice; highest roll takes the Player Card and goes first.

**2-Player Variant**:  
- F-block lots (F1–F9) are inactive.  
- If a player draws an F-block card during Step 1, do not place a marker. Resolve lot and casino payouts normally, discard the card, and draw again until a non-F-block card is drawn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has two phases: **Step 1: Draw** and **Step 2: Play**.

#### Step 1: Draw  
1. **Draw a Property Card**  
   - Draw the top card from the deck.  
   - If it’s the "End of Game" card, proceed to final scoring immediately.  
2. **Take Over Your Lot**  
   - If the lot is empty, place one of your markers on it — you now own it.  
   - If the lot has a tile with another player’s die (from Sprawl), replace that die with one of your dice showing the **same pip value**.  
   - If the tile has no die, place your die showing the value printed on the board for that lot.  
3. **Owned Lots Pay**  
   - Every player collects $1M for **each** undeveloped lot they own (marked with their marker). This occurs every turn regardless of the drawn card.  
4. **Casinos Pay**  
   - **If the drawn card shows a color (e.g., gold)**: All casinos of that color pay.  
   - **If the drawn card says "Pay The Strip"**: All casinos with **at least one edge touching the Strip** pay.  
   - **Money Payment**: Each player receives $1M for **each pip** on their dice in qualifying casinos.  
     - Example: A die showing 5 pays $5M to its owner.  
   - **Point Payment**: The **boss** of each qualifying casino receives 1 VP per tile in that casino.  
     - The boss is the player with the **highest single die** in the casino.  
     - In case of a tie for highest die, see "After Each Action" rule.  
5. **Discard the Card**  
   - Place the drawn card on its color’s discard pile on the board.  

#### Step 2: Play  
During this phase, the player may perform any number of actions in any order, except **Gamble**, which may be done only once per turn. Actions include:  

- **Build**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Own an undeveloped lot (has your marker).  
  - **Cost**: Pay the amount shown on the lot.  
  - **Action**:  
    - Remove your marker.  
    - Place an available casino tile of any color.  
    - Place one of your dice in the tile, showing the value printed on the lot.  
  - **Note**: If all your dice are in use, you must move a die from another tile to this one (leaving the original tile unowned but still part of the casino).  

- **Sprawl**  
  - **Prerequisite**: You are the boss of a casino; adjacent unowned lot exists.  
  - **Cost**: 2× the build cost of the target lot.  
  - **Action**:  
    - Place a tile of the **same color** as your casino on an adjacent unowned lot.  
    - Place one of your dice showing the lot’s printed die value.  
  - **Note**: The card for the sprawled lot remains in the deck — another player may later claim it by drawing it.  

- **Remodel**  
  - **Prerequisite**: You are the boss of the casino.  
  - **Cost**: $5M per tile in the casino.  
  - **Action**:  
    - Choose a new color with enough available tiles to replace all current ones.  
    - Replace all tiles in the casino with the new color.  
  - **Note**: This can merge casinos or initiate hostile takeovers.  

- **Reorganize**  
  - **Prerequisite**: You have at least one die in the casino (need not be boss).  
  - **Cost**: $1M per pip on **all dice** in the casino.  
  - **Action**:  
    - All players reroll **all** their dice in the casino.  
    - Players return their rerolled dice to **any** of their original tiles in the casino (placement choice is theirs).  
  - **Limit**: No die may be reorganized more than once per turn.  

- **Gamble** (once per turn)  
  - **Prerequisite**: Bet at a casino where **another player is the boss**.  
  - **Action**:  
    - Give the House Card to the boss.  
    - Choose one of their casinos.  
    - Bet up to $5M per tile in the casino.  
    - You cannot bet more than you have or more than the boss has.  
  - **Roll 2 dice**:  
    - **Win (3, 4, 9, 10, 11)**: Boss pays you the bet amount.  
    - **Win Big (2 or 12)**: Boss pays you **double** the bet (up to their available funds).  
    - **Lose (5, 6, 7, 8)**: You pay the boss the bet amount.  
  - **Gamble Variant (optional)**:  
    - Boss may "lay off" half the bet to the bank before the roll.  
    - On win/loss, bank covers half the payout/collection (rounded down).  

- **Trade** (at any time, even out of turn)  
  - Players may trade:  
    - Money  
    - Lots (undeveloped spaces)  
    - Dice in casinos (swap dice of same value)  
    - Actions (only during your own turn)  
  - **Cannot trade**:  
    - Victory points  
    - Casino tiles  
    - Promises of future actions  
  - **Process**:  
    - Swap markers for lots.  
    - Swap dice (new die has same value as the one replaced).  

#### After Each Action: Resolve Boss Ties  
After **any** action (Build, Sprawl, Remodel, Reorganize), check each casino:  
- If **two or more players** have dice tied for the highest value, **only those tied dice are rerolled**.  
- Repeat until one player has the sole highest die.  
- If all tied dice belong to the **same player**, no reroll occurs.  
- This can cause a third player with a lower die to become boss if tied players roll lower.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Casino Definition**: A contiguous group of tiles of the same color (edge-adjacent). Treated as a single entity.  
- **Boss Determination**: Player with the **single highest die** in a casino.  
- **Scoring Track**:  
  - Has "breaks" at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80.  
  - To cross a break, the **individual payout** must be large enough.  
  - Example: At 8, a 1-point payout does **not** advance to 10. Need 2+ points.  
  - Multiple small payouts cannot be combined to cross a break — must be resolved **smallest to largest**.  
- **Available Components**:  
  - Only 9 tiles per color — cannot build if all are in play.  
  - Only 12 dice per player — must reuse if all are placed.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game Ends When**:  
  1. The "End of Game" card is drawn — game ends **immediately after Step 1**.  
  2. **OR** a player reaches **90+ points** — wins instantly.  
- **Final Payout**:  
  - After drawing the "End of Game" card, resolve:  
    - All owned lots pay $1M each.  
    - "Pay The Strip" is triggered: All casinos touching the Strip pay money and points as usual.  
- **Winning**:  
  - Player with **most points** wins.  
  - **Tie**: Player with **most money** wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build on a lot I don’t own?**  
  No. Only on lots with your marker.  
- **What happens if I sprawl but don’t have a die?**  
  You must move one of your dice from another tile to the new one. The original tile remains but is unowned.  
- **Can I remodel a casino I don’t fully own?**  
  Yes, as long as you are the **boss**. You change the color of all tiles, regardless of who owns dice in them.  
- **Can I reorganize a casino where I have only one die?**  
  Yes. As long as you have at least one die, you may reorganize.  
- **Do I get points every time my casino color is drawn?**  
  Only if you are the **boss** when the card is drawn.  
- **Can I trade during another player’s turn?**  
  Yes, except for trading **actions**, which can only be done on your own turn.  
- **What if the bank runs out of money?**  
  The game assumes sufficient funds. If needed, use placeholders.  
- **Can I sprawl into multiple directions in one action?**  
  No. Each Sprawl is a single tile. You may perform multiple Sprawl actions.
