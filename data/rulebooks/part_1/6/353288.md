## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Each player travels through time using a time machine to complete a 3-day tour of major historical events. The goal is to score the most points by completing itineraries, maintaining chronologically ordered treks of event cards, earning Time Crystals, and receiving punctuality bonuses. The game ends after three rounds (days), and the player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, the player with the longest trek wins; if still tied, compare the next longest trek, and so on.

2. Components  
- 3 History decks (Day I, Day II, Day III)  
- Itinerary cards  
- Ancestor cards (6/9/12 based on 2/3/4 players)  
- Time Warp cards (Advanced Rule only)  
- Player materials per color:  
  - 2 cylinders (1 for score track, 1 for Time Warp activation)  
  - 1 Pocket Watch token  
  - 1 Crystal Tank  
- Time Crystals  
- Experience tokens (colored and purple Wild)  
- Playmat with:  
  - Clock board (1–12 o’clock track)  
  - Departures Row (6 card slots)  
  - Date Index (chronological guide)  
  - Scoring reference for trek lengths  
- Reference cards  

3. Setup  
- Place Ancestor cards face up on designated spots on the playmat (6 for 2 players, 9 for 3, 12 for 4).  
- Shuffle the Day I History deck. Draw 5 cards and place them face up in the Departures Row. Place 1 card face up on top of the deck.  
- Set aside shuffled Day II and Day III decks.  
- Shuffle Itineraries and deal 4 face down to each player. Each player selects 1 to use (randomly in first game).  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 2 cylinders (place 1 on 0 of score track)  
  - 1 Pocket Watch  
  - 1 Crystal Tank  
- Give each player 1 Time Crystal (placed on Crystal Tank).  
- Give each player a Reference card.  
- Stack all Pocket Watches randomly on the 12 o’clock space of the Clock board.  
- (Advanced Rule) Shuffle Time Warp deck. Draw 3 as a face-up stack. Place the top card in the center of the Clock board. Return the rest to the box.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of 3 rounds (days). Each round proceeds in player turns until all players reach 12 o’clock.

Turn Sequence (per player):  
1. **Determine Turn Order**: The player with the Pocket Watch furthest behind on the clock goes first. If multiple watches are stacked, the top one takes the turn.  
2. **Choose a Card**: Select one of the 6 cards in the Departures Row (including the top card of the deck) or an available Ancestor card.  
3. **Move Pocket Watch**:  
   - Move your Pocket Watch forward by the hour value (lower-left number) on the chosen card.  
   - You may spend Time Crystals to reduce movement cost by 1 per crystal, to a minimum of 1 hour.  
   - Land on or before 12 o’clock; if movement exceeds 12, stop at 12.  
4. **Collect Benefits**:  
   - Gain Experience tokens and Time Crystals shown on the card and in the space below the Departures Row.  
   - Place Experience tokens on your Itinerary card in matching columns, top to bottom.  
   - Purple Wild tokens may be placed in any column.  
   - Unplaceable tokens are returned to the supply.  
   - If a token type is out of supply, substitute with a Wild token.  
   - Move score cylinder for completing rows or covering specific spaces on Itinerary.  
   - Add gained Time Crystals to your Crystal Tank.  
5. **Place Card in Trek**:  
   - First card starts a new Trek (stack of cards).  
   - To add to current Trek: new card’s year must be later than the previous card.  
   - If new card’s year is earlier:  
     - Collapse current Trek into a face-down stack (saved for scoring).  
     - Start a new Trek with the new card.  
   - Ancestor cards:  
     - Can be added to a Trek; their date becomes same as previous card.  
     - Cannot start a new Trek.  
     - Multiple Ancestors allowed per Trek.  
6. **Slide and Refill Market**:  
   - Slide cards right to fill empty Departures Row slots.  
   - Move top card of deck to leftmost empty slot.  
   - Reveal new top card of the deck.  

End of Day (Round End):  
Triggered when all players have reached 12 o’clock.  
- Discard current History deck and all Departures Row cards.  
- Bring out next Day’s deck (Day II or III).  
- Draw 5 cards to fill Departures Row; place 1 card face up on top of deck.  
- Discard current Itineraries and all placed Experience tokens.  
- Each player selects a new Itinerary (random in first game).  
- Keep current (unfinished) Trek; it carries into the next day.  
- (Advanced Rule) Discard current Time Warp card. Return player cylinders. Place next Time Warp card from stack in center of Clock board.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Trek**: A sequence of History or Ancestor cards collected in chronological order (by year).  
  - Treks must be in ascending order; earlier card breaks the sequence.  
  - Broken treks are stacked face down and preserved for scoring.  
  - Ancestor cards inherit the date of the prior card in the trek.  
- **Time Crystals**:  
  - Spent during movement to reduce hour cost (min 1).  
  - Each unspent crystal is worth 1 point at game end.  
- **Punctuality Bonus**: Landing exactly on 12 o’clock grants +3 points.  
- **Itinerary**: Player-specific card with colored rows. Tokens must be placed top-down in matching columns. Completing rows may trigger immediate scoring.  
- **Time Warps (Advanced Rule)**:  
  - Activated: Use instead of card; costs hours (discountable with crystals); usable once per day.  
  - Unlimited (with ∞ symbol): Use without paying hour cost; gain card benefits and space benefits.  
  - Only one Time Warp active per day; replaced at round end.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Final Scoring (after Day III):  
- **Unspent Time Crystals**: 1 point each.  
- **Trek Scoring**: Score each completed trek based on number of cards:  
  - Use scoring table on playmat.  
  - Treks with >10 cards: each additional card beyond 10 is worth 3 points.  
- **Punctuality Bonuses**: 3 points for each day landed exactly on 12 o’clock.  
- **Itinerary Scoring**: Points earned during play for completing rows or covering spaces.  

Total all points. Highest score wins.  
Tiebreaker:  
1. Player with longest single trek.  
2. If tied, compare second-longest trek, then third, etc.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip my turn?** No. You must take a card or use a Time Warp.  
- **What if I draw a card that breaks my trek?** Collapse current trek (face down), start new trek with new card.  
- **Can I place a Wild token in a full column?** No. Tokens not placeable are lost.  
- **Can I use multiple Time Warps in a turn?** No. Only one per day, unless Unlimited type allows multiple uses.  
- **Do Ancestor cards count toward trek length?** Yes. Each Ancestor card adds 1 to the trek.  
- **If I land past 12, do I get the bonus?** No. Only exact arrival grants the +3 punctuality bonus.  
- **Can I use a Time Crystal to go backward?** No. Movement is always forward; crystals only reduce forward cost.
