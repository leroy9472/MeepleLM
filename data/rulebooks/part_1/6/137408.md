  - Land spaces must connect orthogonally (not diagonally). No water areas may be fully surrounded by land.  
- Place Time Markers in ascending order on the Frame.  
- Place 1 Treasure Chest on each "Big Island" (20+ land spaces). Other islands are "Small Islands".  
- Place Commodity Tokens on matching spaces on islands.  
- Place Neutral Landscape Tiles (beige side up) and Planning Token near the board.

- Stack Player Order Discs randomly on the first space of the Special Action Track. The top disc is the starting player.  
- Gold Distribution: Player 1 = 0, Player 2 = 1, Player 3 = 2, Player 4 = 3.  
- Shuffle Pirate Markers, place 5 face-down on Storage Board, reveal 1.  
- Place 8 random Progress Tiles face-up on Storage Board.  
- Sort Production Tokens by player count; remove those not applicable. Fill top 8 (3P) or 10 (4P) spaces.  
- Drop all 49 cubes into the Tower; place fallen cubes in colored storage areas.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 5 Rounds. Each Round has 7 Phases (one per cube color: Blue, Black, Red, Brown, Green, Yellow, White).  
Each Phase:  
1. Starting player drops all cubes of the current phase color into the Tower.  
2. Place fallen cubes in the center. The largest number of cubes of a single color determines available Action Points (AP).  
3. Players take turns in order (starting with player farthest on Special Action Track, then top-down on stacked discs):  
   - Choose a color of fallen cube and perform its action using up to the available AP.  
   - Or choose "Take Gold" instead.  
   - Gold can be spent 1-for-1 to gain extra AP.  
4. After all players act, move cubes to storage.  
5. Proceed to next color phase.  
After 7 Phases: Intermediate Scoring.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **MOVE SHIPS (Blue)**:  
  - First use: Place both Ships on any Frame space.  
  - Each AP moves either or both Ships 1 orthogonal water space.  
  - Ships may move through Sea (1 per space) or Ocean (unlimited per space).  
  - Ending on an Anchor space allows establishing a Trading Post (if unoccupied).  
  - First player to establish a Trading Post on an island scores 3 VP.  

- **LOAD CANNONS (Black)**:  
  - Gain 1 Cannon per AP (max 12).  
  - Excess beyond 12: gain 2 Gold.  

- **PLAN (Red)**:  
  - Spend AP to take tiles into personal supply:  
    - Own Village Tiles: 1 AP each (any size).  
    - Neutral Landscape Tiles: 1–6 AP (equal to size). Only 1 per phase.  

- **PROGRESS (Brown)**:  
  - Advance 1 space per AP on Progress Track.  
  - Take a Progress Tile when reaching or passing a numbered space (1, 3, 6, 10, 15).  
  - Excess beyond 15: gain 2 Gold.  

- **BUILD (Green)**:  
  - Build on islands with at least one of your Trading Posts.  
  - Cost:  
    - Village Tiles: 1 AP each.  
    - Landscape Tiles: 1–6 AP (equal to size).  
  - Must be placed orthogonally adjacent to:  
    - Your Trading Post, or  
    - A chain of your tiles connected back to a Trading Post.  
  - Take any Commodity Token covered.  
  - May build over empty Trading Post spaces.  
  - Score VP shown on tile (small number for Small Islands, large for Big Islands), then flip face-up.  
  - **Completing an Island**:  
    - Score 3 VP.  
    - If Big Island: take Treasure Chest (can be discarded anytime for 3 Gold).  
    - All players with Trading Posts score:  
      - 1/2/3/4/5/6 Trading Posts → 1/3/6/10/15/21 VP × Top Time Marker value.  

- **BUY PRODUCTION TOKENS (Yellow)**:  
  - Buy from Storage Board at AP cost equal to number on token.  
  - Stack on Player Sheet over matching Commodity.  

- **SPECIAL ACTION (White)**:  
  - Option 1: Advance on Special Action Track (1 space per AP). Place disc on top if landing on occupied space.  
    - Excess beyond end: gain 2 Gold.  
  - Option 2: Perform action matching color under your disc.  
    - Disc on last space: may use any color action.  

- **TAKE GOLD (Optional Action)**:  
  - Instead of an action, gain Gold = total fallen cubes ÷ 3, rounded up.  
  - For each Gold beyond 12, score 1 VP immediately.  

- **Progress Tiles**:  
  - Effects vary (examples):  
    - +2 AP when performing a specific action.  
    - Flip to score VP equal to fallen cubes.  
    - Pirates’ strength +2 for others.  
    - Half VP loss if pirates not defeated.  
    - Score 1 VP per Trading Post at game end.  
    - Gain 8 AP when moving ships.  
    - Gain 1 Gold per Trading Post established.  
    - Gain 2 Gold if pirates defeated.  
    - Score 7 VP at game end.  
    - Take 2 Neutral Landscape Tiles when Planning.  
    - Gain Gold at 1 per 2 cubes when Taking Gold.  
    - Gain 3 or 5 Gold once.  
    - Score VP equal to Gold track at game end.

6. Scoring & End Game  
After 5th Round, perform Final Scoring:  
1. Convert Treasure Chests and 1x Gold Progress Tiles to Gold. Score 1 VP for each Gold exceeding 12.  
2. Score 1 VP per Gold on track.  
3. For each Good type:  
   - Multiply # of Commodity Tokens × # of Production Tokens (including preprinted one).  
   - Score VP equal to product.  
4. Score VP for each "E" Progress Tile.  
5. Score VP equal to highest space reached or passed on Progress Track.  
6. Score VP equal to highest space reached or passed on Special Action Track.  
- Tiebreaker: Player ahead in turn order wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Multiple players choose same action**: Allowed. Each uses AP independently.  
- **No cubes fall from Tower**: Skip phase; no actions.  
- **Disc exceeds track end (Cannon, Progress, Special Action)**: Gain 2 Gold, regardless of overage amount.  
- **Pirate defense**: Must spend Cannons equal to total face-up Pirate values. If insufficient: spend all Cannons, then lose VP equal to full Pirate sum.  
- **Building over Trading Post space**: Allowed. Prevents future Trading Post placement.  
- **White cubes as jokers**: When using Special Action to take a colored action, white cubes count as that color.  
- **Overcapacity Gold**: Any Gold beyond 12 during gain triggers immediate 1 VP per excess Gold.  
- **Progress Tile timing**: Effects apply immediately when token is acquired or when condition is met.  
- **End of Round setup**: After discarding top Time Marker, refill Progress and Production Tiles as in initial setup.
