# HANABI — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Hanabi is a cooperative card game where players work together to create a spectacular fireworks display. The goal is to play cards of five colors (red, yellow, green, blue, white) in ascending order from 1 to 5. Success depends on effective communication and deduction, as players cannot see their own cards.

### 2. Components
- 50 fireworks cards in five colors (10 per color): values 1 (×3), 2 (×2), 3 (×2), 4 (×2), 5 (×1)
- 10 multicolored (rainbow) fireworks cards: values 1 (×3), 2 (×2), 3 (×2), 4 (×2), 5 (×1)
- 8 Note tokens (+1 spare)
- 3 Storm tokens

### 3. Setup
- Shuffle the 50 standard fireworks cards. For the basic game, multicolored cards are not used.
- Deal cards face-out to each player (so they cannot see their own cards):
  - 2–3 players: 5 cards each
  - 4–5 players: 4 cards each
- Place the remaining cards face-down as the draw pile.
- Place 8 Note tokens white-side-up (scroll-side-up).
- Place 3 Storm tokens lightning-side-down.
- The oldest player goes first.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Play proceeds clockwise. On a turn, a player must perform exactly one of the following actions:

#### A. Give a Hint
- Flip one Note token to its black (blank) side.
- Choose one teammate and give a **color hint** or **value hint**:
  - **Color Hint**: Indicate all cards of a specific color in the teammate’s hand.
  - **Value Hint**: Indicate all cards of a specific number in the teammate’s hand.
- You must identify **all** matching cards (or state that there are none).
- Example: "You have two yellow cards, here and here." or "You have no 3s."
- Players may not give hints outside their turn.

#### B. Discard a Card
- Flip one Note token from black to white (regain a hint).
- Discard one card from your hand (without looking at it) to the discard pile.
- Draw a new card from the draw pile (also held face-out).
- Players may rearrange their hand cards to track known information.

#### C. Play a Card
- Take one card from your hand and attempt to play it:
  - If the card extends a firework stack (e.g., next in sequence 1→2→3) or starts a new stack (with a 1), it is **played correctly**.
  - If not, it is **invalid**:
    - Discard the card.
    - Flip one Storm token to its lightning-side-up.
    - If all 3 Storm tokens are flipped, the game ends immediately with 0 points.
- Draw a new card after playing.
- **Bonus**: If a 5 is played correctly, flip one Note token back to white (regain a hint). No bonus if all tokens are already white.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Firework Stacks**: Each color builds a sequence from 1 to 5. Only one card of each value per color may be played.
- **Card Knowledge**: Players rely on hints to learn about their cards. Rearranging cards in hand is allowed to track information.
- **Discard Pile**: Always visible and may be searched for information.
- **Communication Rules**: Strictly, only the active player may speak (during hinting). Groups may allow limited additional talk as house rules.
- **Hand Management**: Players should organize cards to distinguish known vs. unknown. The leftmost unknown card (the "chop") is typically discarded when needed.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends immediately in one of three ways:
1. **All five firework stacks are completed (1–5)** → Maximum score of 25.
2. **Third Storm token is flipped** → Game over, score = 0.
3. **Last card is drawn** → Each player (including the drawer) gets **one final turn**. No cards are drawn during this round.

**Final Scoring**:
- Score = sum of the highest card played in each color (e.g., Red:3, Yellow:5, Green:2, Blue:4, White:1 → 3+5+2+4+1 = 15).
- Maximum score: 25.

**Score Interpretation**:
- 0–5: Oh dear! The crowd booed.
- 6–10: Poor! Hardly applauded.
- 11–15: OK! The viewers have seen better.
- 16–20: Good! The audience is pleased.
- 21–24: Very good! The audience is enthusiastic!
- 25: Legendary! The audience will never forget this show!

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I look at my own cards?** No, until you play or discard them.
- **Can I discard a card I know is playable?** Yes, but it’s usually unwise.
- **What if I have no Note tokens to give a hint?** You cannot give a hint; choose discard or play.
- **What if I have no flipped Note tokens to discard?** You cannot discard; choose hint or play.
- **Can I give a hint about multicolored cards?** Only in the Farbrausch variant. In basic game, they are not used.
- **Can I hint zero cards of a color/value?** Yes. "You have no blue cards" is a valid hint.
