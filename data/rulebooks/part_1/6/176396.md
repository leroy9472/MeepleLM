## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are urban planning interns hired by the Mayor's office after a devastating flood destroyed half the city due to poor policies. The city is in political and environmental crisis, and the interns must rebuild Quadropolis over a 10-mission campaign. Each mission advances a story while introducing a new gameplay variant. The overarching goal is to score Victory Points (VP) across missions, with performance tracked in an evaluation log. Ultimately, players aim to expose corruption, influence city planning, and determine the future leadership of Quadropolis.

### 3. Setup  
General Setup (Classic Mode):  
1. Place Construction Site board in center.  
2. Place Inhabitants and Energy Units in reserve.  
3. Give each player:  
   - 1 Player Mat (Classic side)  
   - 4 Architects (#1–#4, matching their color)  
   - 1 Helper Card  
4. Sort Building Tiles by round number (#1–#4).  
5. Place #1 tiles in bag, draw and place face-down on Construction Site.  
6. Reveal tiles:  
   - 4 players: all face-up  
   - 3 players: leave tiles marked "4" face-down  
   - 2 players: leave tiles marked "4" and "3-4" face-down  
7. Place Urbanist next to Construction Site.  
8. Give Mayor pawn to starting player.  

Expert Mode Setup Differences:

- Playgrounds score like Parks but include 1 Inhabitant and do not absorb pollution.  

Mission-Specific Setup:  
Each mission modifies setup as per its variant rule (see Gameplay Flow).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of 4 rounds (Classic) or 5 rounds (Expert). Each round:  
1. **Setup Construction Site**: Draw and place tiles of current round number.  
2. **Player Turns**: Starting with first player, each player takes 4 turns.  
   On each turn, do the following in order:  
   a. **Take a Building**:  
      - Place one Architect around Construction Site, pointing to a row or column.  
      - Cannot place over another Architect or point at Urbanist.  
      - Take the building at intersection of Architect’s number and pointed row/column.  
      - If spot is empty, no building is taken.  
   b. **Move Urbanist**:  
      - Move Urbanist to the spot just vacated (or pointed to, if empty).  
   c. **Place Building**:  
      - **Classic Mode**: Place on any empty square in the row or column matching Architect number.  
      - **Expert Mode**: Place on any empty square whose **district number** or **square number** matches Architect number.  
      - **Tower Blocks/Office Towers**: May stack on existing tower if:  
         - The tower is in a row/column (Classic) or district/square (Expert) matching Architect number, **or**  
         - The Architect number matches the floor level being built.  
      - May discard building (skip placement and resource gain).  
   d. **Receive Resources**:  
      - Take Inhabitants/Energy Units shown in top-left of tile. Must take even if building is discarded.  
      - VP icons on tile are not awarded until endgame (if building is activated).  
3. **End of Round**:  
   - **Classic**: Players recover their Architects.  
   - **Expert**: Return all Architects to shared pool.  
   - Clear remaining tiles from Construction Site.  
   - Place Urbanist next to Construction Site.  
   - Set up next round’s tiles.  
   - **First Player**: Player who took the Mayor tile becomes first player for next round. If no one took it, first player remains unchanged.  

**Game End**:  
After final round:  
1. Allocate Inhabitants and Energy Units to activate buildings.  
   - Activation cost shown in bottom-right of tile.  
   - Towers require activation regardless of height.  
   - Parks and Monuments do not require activation.  
2. Remove unactivated buildings from city.  
3. Score all activated buildings.  
4. Apply penalties:  
   - −1 VP per unused Inhabitant.  
   - −1 VP per unused Energy Unit (unless placed on Park to absorb pollution).  
5. Apply mission-specific scoring modifiers.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Building Types (Classic Mode)  
| Type | Activation | Scoring | Notes |  
|------|----------|--------|-------|  
| **Tower Block** | 1 Energy | 2 VP (1 floor), 5 VP (2), 6 VP (3), 10 VP (4) | Stackable up to 4 floors; may include Inhabitants |  
| **Shop** | 1 Energy | 1 VP (1 inh.), 2 VP (2), 4 VP (3), 7 VP (4) | Holds up to 4 Inhabitants as Customers |  
| **Public Service** | 1 Inhabitant | 2 VP (1 dist.), 5 VP (2), 9 VP (3), 14 VP (4) | Score based on number of districts with at least one |  
| **Park** | None | 2 VP (1 adj. tower), 4 VP (2), 7 VP (3), 11 VP (4) | Absorbs 1 Energy Unit (prevents −1 VP) |  
| **Factory** | 1 Inhabitant | 2 VP per adjacent Shop, 3 VP per adjacent Harbor | Gains Energy when placed |  
| **Harbor** | 1 Inhabitant | 3 VP (2 in line), 7 VP (3), 12 VP (4) | Score longest row and column separately |  

#### Building Types (Expert Mode Additions)  
| Type | Activation | Scoring | Notes |  
|------|----------|--------|-------|  
| **Office Tower** | 1 Inhabitant + 1 Energy | Based on adjacency group and height (see Helper) | Stackable up to 5 floors |  
| **Monument** | None | 1–3 VP per adjacent building type (see Helper) | Scored based on adjacent buildings |  

#### Mission-Specific Variants  
| Mission | Mode | Key Rules |  
|-------|------|--------|  
| **1: A New Beginning** | Classic | No parks/playgrounds replaced; standard rules |  
| **2: Public Opinion** | Classic + Playgrounds | Replace parks with playgrounds; playgrounds score like parks, give 1 Inhabitant, do not absorb pollution; bonus VP: 3 VP per 3 playgrounds |  
| **3: Senior Architect** | Classic + Playgrounds | Use playgrounds; each player gets grey #5 Architect (wild 1–4); 5 architects available per round, 1 unused |  
| **4: Banding Together** | Classic + Playgrounds | Use playgrounds; architects in shared pool (including grey #5); any player may use any available architect |  
| **5: Bringing in Experts** | Expert | Use Expert mode; replace playgrounds with parks |  
| **6: Mayor's Favor** | Expert + Parks | Expert mode; parks used; first player cannot take Mayor tile on first turn; taking Mayor grants option to take 1 Energy + 1 Inhabitant; tiles with green mayor symbol score +3 VP each |  
| **7: Price of Silence** | Expert + Parks | Expert mode; parks used; bonus VP per district based on filled lots: 0 empty = 4 VP, 1 empty = 2 VP, 2+ empty = 0 VP |  
| **8: The Corruption Trail** | Classic + Parks | Classic mode; parks used; turn order: each player must use Architect 1, then next player uses 1 or 2, etc.; wraps from 4 to 1 |  
| **9: Unemployment** | Classic + Playgrounds | Classic mode; playgrounds used; all Inhabitants from tiles doubled; −2 VP per unemployed Inhabitant; −1 VP per shopping spouse > working spouse |  
| **10: Re-Election** | Expert + Playgrounds | Expert mode; playgrounds used; private architect pools (no shared pool) |

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Final Scoring Steps**:  
1. Activate buildings using Inhabitants and Energy Units.  
2. Remove unactivated buildings.  
3. Score all buildings per type.  
4. Apply mission-specific scoring (e.g., playground bonuses, district completion, mayor tile bonuses).  
5. Apply penalties:  
   - −1 VP per unused Inhabitant (−2 in Mission 9)  
   - −1 VP per unused Energy Unit (unless absorbed by Park)  
6. Sum total VP.  

**Winning**:  
- Highest total VP wins.  
- Tiebreakers:  
  1. Most Inhabitants on buildings  
  2. Fewest empty spaces in city  

**Campaign Scoring (Final)**:  
- Sum scores from all 10 missions.  
- Determine winners in categories (implied: overall, consistency, etc.).  
- Tiebreaker: Winner of Mission #A (context implies a specific mission, but not defined).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I use the grey #5 Architect (Alejandro) more than once per round?**  
A: Yes, in Missions 3 and 4, it is a wild (1–4) and can be reused if available. In Mission 4, it’s in shared pool.  

**Q: Do playgrounds absorb pollution?**  
A: No. They do not have pollution absorption ability.  

**Q: Can I refuse the extra Energy and Inhabitant when taking the Mayor tile in Mission 6?**  
A: Yes. The player may take both or refuse both.  

**Q: What happens if no architect is available in Mission 8 due to turn order restriction?**  
A: You must still place an architect. If only higher-numbered ones are available, you may use the next higher or same as previous player. If none, you must use one that breaks sequence only if no legal move exists — but rules imply forced sequence.  

**Q: In Mission 9, how is "shopping spouse > working spouse" calculated?**  
A: Compare total Inhabitants in Shops (shopping) vs. total Inhabitants used as workers (in activated Public Services, Factories, Offices). For each excess shopping Inhabitant, −1 VP.  

**Q: In Mission 10, do players use their own architect colors?**  
A: Yes. Private pools mean each player uses their own 4 architects (plus #5 if included).  

**Q: Can Monuments be activated?**  
A: No. They do not require activation and score regardless.  

**Q: Can I move resources during the game?**  
A: Yes. Resources can be freely reallocated at any time until final scoring.
