### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Attack Action (5 Steps)  
1. **Choose Target**: Must be in Line of Sight (LoS) and Range.  
   - LoS: center-to-center; blocked by opponents, obstructing terrain, elevation, tile edges.  
   - Allies in LoS: -1 to ATK roll.  
   - Hindering terrain in path: -1 to ATK roll.  
2. **Build Combat Dice Pool**:  
   - Use dice from equipped weapons.  
   - 1-handed: one die; 2-handed: two dice.  
   - If only one weapon die: add 1 PURPLE.  
   - If no weapons: add 2 PURPLE.  
3. **Empower**: Spend 1 SP to add BLACK die.  
   - Some weapons/abilities always empower (BLACK shown on card).  
4. **Dodge (by target)**:  
   - Spend 1 SP to Dodge.  
   - Roll BLACK: each SHIELD adds +1 to Defense. SKULL = fail.  
5. **Roll to Hit**:  
   - Roll Combat Dice Pool.  
   - Add bonuses (e.g., from symbols, abilities).  
   - If total ≥ target’s Defense → **Hit**. Else → **Miss**.  

#### Flanking & Backstab  
- **Flanking**: Two allies adjacent to target, on opposite sides (orthogonal or diagonal). Grants +1 to ATK roll.  
- **Backstab**: If attacker has BACKSTAB tag and is flanking → +3 PHYSICAL DMG.

#### Determine Damage  
- For each point by which ATK exceeds Defense: +1 PHYSICAL DMG.  
- Add other damage sources (tags, abilities).  
- **Subtract Armor**:  
  - Armor reduces PHYSICAL DMG.  
  - ARMOR PIERCING (X): ignore first X points of Armor. Cumulative.  
- **Final Damage**: Remaining after armor. Apply IRREDUCIBLE, MAGIC, or PHYSICAL.  
- If Final Damage = 0 or Attack Missed → Check for Counter.

#### Follow-Up (FU) Abilities  
- Trigger only if Attack hits.  
- May use multiple FU abilities unless one starts a new Attack/Spell.  
- FU with FORCE (X): Spell-Like Ability. Target must fail Conviction Check.  
  - FORCE = X (or X + difference by which attack hit).  
  - Cannot Empower Spell-Like Abilities.

#### Counter  
- Trigger if Attack misses or deals 0 Final Damage.  
- Spend 2 SP (1 SP if successfully dodged).  
- Must have LoS and Range to attacker.  
- Counter Attack replaces current action (no FU for original attacker).

#### Spell Action  
- Not a Standard Action; triggered by SPELL (X) ability.  
1. **Choose Target**: Within Sphere of Influence (SOI).  
2. **Determine Force**:  
   - Roll Casting Die + X (usually 6).  
   - May Empower: spend 1 SP, add BLACK; each BOOK rolled adds +1 to Force.  
3. **Conviction Check**: Target rolls Conviction Dice.  
   - If total ≥ Force → resists.  
   - If < Force → suffers effect.  
4. **Resolve Effect**: e.g., damage, debuff, movement.  
- Allies may choose to fail Conviction Check.

#### Spell-Like Abilities  
- Use FORCE (X) or FORCE (X) + DIFFERENCE HIT.  
- Same steps as Spell, but cannot be Empowered.  
- Must target same figure as original attack if from FU.

#### Movement & Terrain  
- **Normal**: 1 movement point per space.  
- **Hindering**: 2 movement points to leave.  
- **Water**: 2 movement points to leave; cannot Dodge while in.  
- **Muck**: +1 SP cost for all actions.  
- **Elevation**: +1 cost per upward level; -1 per downward (max -2).  
- **Break Attack**: Triggered when leaving space adjacent to opponent.  
  - 1 per turn max.  
  - Always Melee unless stated.  
  - Made in space being left.

#### Jumping  
- Only during Move Action or free movement.  
- Must start in unoccupied Normal terrain.  
- Cannot jump over occupied spaces.  
- **Agility Check**: DC 10 + 2 per additional space.  
- **Boost**: If ally adjacent to start space, add one ally’s Strength.  
- **Catch**: If fail and ally adjacent to end space, ally may make Perception Check (same DC).  
  - Success: adventurer lands safely.  
  - Fail/no ally: land on first jumped space; movement ends.

#### Line of Sight (LoS) & Sphere of Influence (SOI)  
- **LoS**: Center-to-center. Blocked by:  
  - Opponents  
  - Obstructing terrain  
  - Elevation differences  
  - Tile edges (if no adjacent tile)  
- Diagonals: Choose orthogonal path; apply terrain effects.  
- Visible if at least one path is clear.  
- **SOI**: Like LoS but ignores figures; only obstructing terrain blocks.  
- -1 to ATK if: at least one ally in LoS path OR at least one hindering terrain in path.

#### Stamina Points (SP)  
- SP spent on actions, abilities.  
- Recovered during Refresh Phase (except turn 1 of encounter).  
- Max SP determined by Stamina Recovery Bar.

#### Item Limits  
- 2 Weapons (1 per hand) + 1 Upgrade per hand  
- 1 Armor + 1 Armor Upgrade  
- 1 Core + 1 Core Upgrade  
- 1 Accessory  
- 3 Relics
