# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In *Black Rose Wars*, players take on the role of powerful Mages within the Black Rose Order, each vying to become the Grand Master by mastering the sentient Black Rose Artifact. Mages begin in their personal Cells and must navigate the Lodge, complete Quests, battle opponents, and manipulate Rooms to gain Power Points (PP). The game ends when any Mage or the Black Rose reaches 30 PP. The Mage with the most PP at the end, including end-game bonuses, becomes the Grand Master.

## 3. Setup
1. **Lodge Layout**: Place Black Rose Room and Throne Room adjacent. Shuffle and place remaining 16 rooms around them to form the Lodge.
2. **Place Tokens**: Put Activation Tokens in all rooms except Black Rose Room (add its token when Second Moon begins).
3. **Cells**: Shuffle Mage Cells and place them at the board edges based on player count. Players choose a Mage and color, then place their miniature on the matching Cell.
4. **Boards**: Place Power Board and Event Board nearby.
5. **Decks**: Place Quest (First Moon), Event (First Moon), and 6 School decks (Library) near the board. Set Forgotten Spell deck aside.
6. **First Player**: The player who most recently gave or received a rose takes the Crown Token.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn proceeds in 6 phases:
1. **Black Rose Phase**: Shift and draw Event Cards. Discard unwanted Quests. Crown changes hands if Event specifies.
2. **Study Phase**: Draw 2 from Grimoire. Draw 4 from Library, keep 2, discard 2 to respective school piles.
3. **Preparation Phase**: Place 2–4 spell cards face-down on your Mage Sheet, one in the Quick Spell slot. Choose active side/orientation.
4. **Action Phase**: Starting with First Player, perform 1–2 actions per round in any order until all players pass. Actions include:
   - Use Physical Action Token (move 2 or attack 2 damage + optional room activation)
   - Play Quick Spell
   - Play leftmost Standard Spell
   - Discard unactivated spell to move 1 room
5. **Evocation Phase**: Activate all your Evocations in any order. Each may move up to its Movement value, then attack.
6. **Clean-Up Phase**:
   - Move played spells to Memories
   - Return untriggered Traps to hand
   - Flip used Action and Room Activation Tokens
   - Check for unstable rooms (most Instability Tokens wins Activation Token; tie goes to Black Rose)
   - Flip room to destroyed side, remove Instability Tokens
   - If any Mage or Black Rose has ≥30 PP, game ends

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Hand Limit**: Varies by Mage (6–11). Excess cards discarded to Memories.
- **Damage & Defeat**: When a Mage’s Damage Tokens equal Health, they are defeated:
  - Return to Cell
  - Award Trophy Token to killer
  - Award PP: 1st (4 PP, or 5 if only contributor), 2nd (2 PP), Participation (1 PP). Ties reduce by 1 PP.
- **Instability**: Spells with vortex symbol generate 1 Instability in caster’s room. Rooms with full Instability are destroyed; winner gains Activation Token.
- **Rooms**: Each has an ability usable once per round (token flipped). Destroyed rooms cannot be activated.
- **Quests**: Secret, max 2 at a time. Completing them grants PP and may replace room activation effects. Draw during Black Rose Phase if below 2.
- **Evocations**: Summoned via spells or rooms. Max 3 per Mage. Act in Evocation Phase: move then attack.
- **Traps & Protections**: Played face-down with token. Triggered when condition met. Traps interrupt opponent’s turn; Protections interrupt damage.
- **Forgotten Spells**: Unlocked at Second Moon. Draw by activating Black Rose Room (discard 4, draw 3, keep 1). Played spells are removed from game.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends when any Mage or Black Rose reaches 30 PP. Final scoring:
1. **Completed Quests**:
   - 1st: 6 PP (5 if tied)
   - 2nd: 2 PP (1 if tied)
   - Participation (≥1 quest): 1 PP
2. **Trophy Tokens**:
   - 1st: 4 PP (3 if tied)
   - 2nd: 2 PP (1 if tied)
   - Participation (≥1 token): 1 PP
3. **Room Activation Tokens**: Sum PP values on tokens collected.
4. **Crown Bearer**: +1 PP
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with Crown decides winner among tied players.
