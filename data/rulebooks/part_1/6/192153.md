## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu*, players are Investigators working to prevent the awakening of ancient, malevolent Old Ones from beyond space and time. The world teeters on the edge of madness as cultists gather and gates to other dimensions open.  

**Objective:** Seal all 4 gates before the final Old One (Cthulhu) awakens. If all gates are sealed, the Investigators win. If Cthulhu awakens or any loss condition occurs, the game is lost.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board and set out all tokens.  
2. Place 1 gate token in each of the 4 towns that have gate locations.

4. All players choose an Investigator and take the corresponding card (sane side up), 4 sanity tokens, and start at Arkham Police Station.  
5. Shuffle the Player deck and deal 4 Clue cards to each player.  
6. Set aside the Old One cards in order (face down, in sequence). The first Old One is not revealed at start.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On each player’s turn, follow these 3 steps in order:  

#### 1. Do 4 Actions  
You may take up to 4 actions. Any combination is allowed, including repeating the same action.  

**Movement Actions:**  
- **Walk:** Move to any connected location (along a path).  
- **Bus:**  
  - Discard a Clue card matching your current town to move to **any** location in **any** town.  
  - Discard **any** Clue card to move to **any** location in the **matching town**.  
- **Use a Gate:** Move from one **open** gate to another **open** gate.  
  - After moving, **roll the sanity die**.  
  - If the destination has a Shoggoth, roll the sanity die **again**.  
  - Cannot use sealed gates.  

**Special Actions:**  
- **Defeat a Cultist:** Remove 1 cultist from your location.  
- **Defeat a Shoggoth:** Spend **3 actions** on your turn to remove 1 Shoggoth from your location. Then **draw 1 Relic card**.  
- **Give/Receive 1 Clue Card:** Trade with another player at the same location. The card must match the **current town**.  
- **Give/Receive 1 Relic Card:** Trade with another player at the same location.  
- **Seal a Gate:** At a gate location, discard **5 Clue cards** matching the **current town**.  
  - Place a Seal token on the gate.  
  - Remove **1 cultist from each location** in that town.  
  - You may seal a gate even if cultists or a Shoggoth are present.  

#### 2. Draw 2 Player Cards  
Draw the top 2 cards from the Player deck.  

**If you draw an Evil Stirs card:**  
Resolve **all steps in order**, one at a time (even if multiple Evil Stirs are drawn).  

1. **Fight the Madness:** Active player rolls the sanity die and applies result.  
2. **Awakening:** Reveal the next Old One. Apply its effect immediately.  
3. **A Shoggoth Appears:** Draw the **bottom card** of the Summoning deck. Place a Shoggoth on that location. Discard the card.  
   - If no Shoggoths remain in supply, **lose the game**.  
4. **Cultists Regroup:** Reshuffle the Summoning discard pile and place it on top of the Summoning deck.  

**If 2 Evil Stirs cards are drawn:**  
- Resolve all 4 steps once, then repeat for the second card.  
- The second card’s Summoning discard goes on top.  

**Hand Limit:** After resolving Evil Stirs, if you have more than 7 cards, discard down to 7 or play Relic cards.  

#### 3. Summoning Step  
Flip over a number of cards from the top of the Summoning deck equal to the **current summoning rate** (based on the rightmost revealed Old One).  

For each card:  
1. **Place a Cultist:** Add 1 cultist to the named location.  
   - If the location already has 3 cultists, **do not add** a 4th. Instead, trigger an **Awakening Ritual**.  
2. **Shoggoth Movement:** If the card has a Shoggoth icon, **after all cultists are placed**, move **each Shoggoth** to the **nearest open gate**.  
   - If a Shoggoth is already on an open gate and must move, **remove it from the board** and trigger an **Awakening Ritual**.  
   - If multiple Shoggoths are equidistant, the **active player** chooses the direction.  

**If the Summoning deck runs out:** Reshuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.  

**Awakening Ritual:**  
- Reveal the next Old One.  
- Apply its effect immediately.  
- If the last Old One (Cthulhu) is revealed, **players lose**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Sanity Rolls – When to Roll  
You **must** roll the sanity die when:  
- You **use a gate** (after moving).  
- You **enter a location with a Shoggoth** or a Shoggoth **enters your location**.  
- Resolving **Fight the Madness** (from Evil Stirs).  
- Resolving a **Relic card effect**.  

**Sanity Die Results:**  
- **Blank:** Nothing happens.  
- **1 Swirl:** Lose 1 sanity token.  
- **2 Swirls:** Lose 2 sanity tokens.  
- **2 Cultist Hoods (Paranoid):** Add 2 cultists to your current location.  

**Insanity:**  
- If you lose all sanity tokens, flip your Investigator card to the **insane side**.  
  - You now have **1 fewer action per turn**.  
  - Your special ability changes (see card).  
  - You **cannot lose more sanity**, but if the die shows 2 cultist hoods, **add 2 cultists** to your location.  
- **Recovering Sanity:**  
  - If an **insane** player seals a gate, they:  
    1. Immediately flip to **sane side**.  
    2. Recover all 4 sanity tokens.  
    3. Are transported to **Church or Hospital** (choice).  
    4. May continue with remaining actions.  

#### Relic Cards  
- May be played **at any time during your turn**, **except** between drawing and resolving a card.  
- **Not an action.**  
- The **player who plays it** decides how to use it.  
- After resolving, **remove the card from the game** and **roll the sanity die**.  
- **Cannot play between multiple Old One awakenings triggered by the same Summoning card.**  
- If **Yog-Sothoth is awake**, only the **active player** may play Relic cards.  

#### Old Ones  
- Revealed when:  
  - An Evil Stirs card is drawn (Awakening step).  
  - 4th cultist would be placed (Awakening Ritual).  
  - A Shoggoth is removed from an open gate.  
- Effects are applied **immediately**.  
- Some effects are **instant**, others are **permanent** (marked with eternity symbol).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Do you roll sanity for each Shoggoth in a location?**  
A: Yes. Roll **once for each Shoggoth** that enters or is present when you enter.  

**Q: Can you play Relic cards during the Summoning step?**  
A: Yes, **between flipping Summoning cards**, but **not between placing a cultist and moving a Shoggoth** on the same flip.

A: No. Only **one Awakening Ritual** occurs, even if 2 cultists are added to a full location.  

**Q: Can you seal a gate with cultists or a Shoggoth present?**  
A: Yes. Remove 1 cultist from each location in the town after sealing.

A: Yes. It can restore **all sanity** to one player, even if insane.
