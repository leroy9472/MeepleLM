  - Resolve Faux Card:  
    - Reveal top Faux card; rotate Dr. Faux’s Machine to point at indicated Era.  
    - Drop (2 + number of Clones in that Era) Rift cubes into machine.  
    - Place cubes in empty Rift slots of landing Eras.  
    - If 4th Rift cube would be placed in an Era:  
      - Remove Mission tile (if any) and return cubes to supply.  
      - Place Vortex tile.  
      - Destroy any Artifacts in that Era; no new Artifacts can be placed there.

    - OR use 1 free move per turn (flip Agent tile to empty battery side).  
  - **Use Artifact Card**:  
    - Exhaust a ready card to use its ability.  
    - Resolve as much of the ability as possible.  
    - Cards may affect Energy, Rifts, Clones, Movement, or other Artifacts.  
    - If a Clone enters its Paradox Era (shown in monocle), it is destroyed (returned to bag).  
  - **Do a LOOP**:  
    - Spend 1 Energy (first LOOP), 2 (second), 3 (third), etc. from current Era.  
    - Choose one Elementary Dimension (Spiral, Star, Stripe); ready all exhausted cards of that Dimension in hand.  
    - Black Hole (•) cards cannot be readied via LOOP.

    - Complete Mission (instant win upon 4th).  
    - Remove Mission tile; place in completed pile.  
    - Reveal new Mission: in Dr. Faux’s current Era, or next clockwise with unrevealed tile.
