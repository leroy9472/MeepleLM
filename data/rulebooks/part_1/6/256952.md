## PART 1 – Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Zombie Kidz Evolution is a legacy-style cooperative board game where players take on the roles of kids defending their school from zombie invasions. The game evolves over multiple sessions, unlocking new rules, characters, and challenges. The objective is to survive by locking all four entryways to the school before zombies overwhelm it.

Over time, players unlock permanent upgrades (Hero Powers, Super-Zombies, Clones) and complete mission groups to progress through the campaign. The ultimate goal is to complete all 13 rewards and unlock the final challenge.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I complete more than one mission per game?  
  A: No. Only one mission may be completed per game, even if multiple are achieved.

    - SUPER-ZOMBIE: Unlocked at Reward 3  
    - CLONE: Unlocked at Reward 5  

- Q: Can I use Clones and Hero Powers in the Zombie Swarm challenge?  
  A: Yes. Use Hero Powers and Clones, but not Super-Zombies.  

- Q: Does losing a game affect mission progress?

- Q: Can Super-Zombies be moved by other Super-Zombie powers?  
  A: Yes. Completing such a game is required for one of the SUPER-ZOMBIE mission objectives.  

- Q: Are Clones affected by Hero Powers?
