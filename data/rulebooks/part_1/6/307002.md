## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
As brave adventurers, players must work together to defeat 12 corrupted royals—4 Jacks, 4 Queens, and 4 Kings—who have been overtaken by a sinister corruption. The objective is to defeat all enemies cooperatively. Victory is achieved by defeating the final King. The game is lost if any player cannot satisfy enemy damage or cannot play or yield on their turn.

### 2. Components  
- Standard 52-card deck (ranks 2–10, Aces, Jacks, Queens, Kings)  
- 2 Jesters (Jokers)  
- Cards are divided into:  
  - **Castle Deck**: 4 Kings, 4 Queens, 4 Jacks (face down, stacked in that order)  
  - **Tavern Deck**: All other cards (2–10, Aces), plus 0–2 Jesters depending on player count  
- **Discard Pile (Hospital)**: Shared pile for discarded cards  
- **Animal Companions**: Aces, used with other cards for combined suit powers  

---

### 3. Setup  
1. **Build the Castle Deck**:  
   - Shuffle 4 Kings and place face down.  
   - Shuffle 4 Queens and place on top.  
   - Shuffle 4 Jacks and place on top.  
   - Turn the top card face up to reveal the first enemy.  

2. **Build the Tavern Deck**:  
   - Shuffle all remaining cards (2–10, 4 Aces) and add:  
     - 0 Jesters for 1 player  
     - 1 Jester for 2 players  
     - 2 Jesters for 3–4 players  
   - Place face down.  

3. **Deal Hands**:  
   - Deal cards to each player:  
     - 1 player: 8 cards  
     - 2 players: 7 cards  
     - 3 players: 6 cards  
     - 4 players: 5 cards  
   - This is each player’s maximum hand size.  

4. **Redraw Rule**: If no player has a Diamond in their initial hand, reshuffle all hands into the Tavern Deck and redeal.  

5. **Determine First Player**: The player who most recently committed regicide goes first.  

6. **Solo Setup**: Place 2 Jesters face up beside the table. They can be flipped later to refresh the hand.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows four steps:  

#### Step 1: Play a Card or Yield  
The current player may:  
- Play a single card  
- Play an Ace (Animal Companion) with one other card (not a Jester)  
- Play a combo: 2–4 cards of the same rank (2, 3, 4, or 5), total value ≤ 10  
- Play a Jester (only alone)  
- Yield (say “Yield”) — skips to Step 4  

**Restrictions**:  
- Aces cannot be in combos.  
- Jesters must be played alone.  
- A player may not yield if all other players have yielded consecutively.  

#### Step 2: Activate Suit Power(s)  
Apply powers of all suits played (except if enemy is immune — see below). Resolve in this order:  
- **Hearts (Heal)**: Shuffle discard pile. Deal X cards (X = total attack value) face down to the bottom of the Tavern Deck. Return the rest face up.  
- **Diamonds (Draw)**: Starting with current player, clockwise, each player draws 1 card until X cards are drawn or Tavern Deck is empty. Skip players at max hand size.  
- **Clubs (Double Damage)**: All Clubs in the play deal double their value in Step 3.  
- **Spades (Shield)**: Reduce current enemy’s attack value by X. This effect is cumulative across all Spade plays against the enemy.  

**Note**:  
- Hearts resolved before Diamonds.  
- If multiple suits, apply all powers at total X.  
- If same suit played multiple times, power applied once.  

#### Step 3: Deal Damage and Check for Defeat  
- Add attack value X to total damage against enemy.  
- Check if total damage ≥ enemy’s health:  
  - **Jacks**: 20 health  
  - **Queens**: 30 health  
  - **Kings**: 40 health  

**If enemy is defeated**:  
1. **Enemy placement**:  
   - If damage exactly equals health → place enemy face down on top of Tavern Deck.  
   - Otherwise → place face up in discard pile.  
2. Discard all cards played against the enemy.  
3. Reveal next enemy from Castle Deck.  
4. The defeating player skips Step 4 and immediately begins a new turn (Step 1).  

#### Step 4: Suffer Damage  
If enemy not defeated:  
- Enemy deals damage equal to its base attack value:  
  - **Jacks**: 10  
  - **Queens**: 15  
  - **Kings**: 20  
- Subtract total Spade shield value from this amount.  
- Current player discards cards one at a time, face up, until total value ≥ net damage.  
- **Card values when discarded**:  
  - Jacks: 10  
  - Queens: 15  
  - Kings: 20  
  - Aces (Animal Companions): 1  
  - Jesters: 0  
- If player cannot discard enough, all players lose.  
- Empty hand is allowed.  
- Next player begins their turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Enemy Immunity  
- Each enemy is immune to suit powers matching their suit.  
  - E.g., Jack of Spades immune to Spade powers (shields do not reduce attack).  
- Card values still count for damage.  
- **Jester cancels immunity**: When played, enemy loses immunity. All suit powers (including matching suit) now work.  

#### Combos  
- Play 2–4 cards of same rank (2, 3, 4, 5), total ≤ 10.  
- Aces cannot be in combos.  
- X = sum of values.  
- Apply all suit powers at total X.  
- E.g., three 3s (total 9): apply all three suit powers at X=9.  

#### Animal Companions (Aces)  
- Play Ace alone or with one other card (not Jester).  
- X = value of other card + 1.  
- Apply suit powers of both cards.  
- If same suit, power applied once.  
- E.g., Ace of Clubs + 7 of Hearts: X=8, deal 8 damage, heal 8 cards.  

#### Jester  
- Attack value: 0  
- Must be played alone.  
- Power: Removes enemy’s suit immunity.  
- After play:  
  - Skip Steps 3 and 4.  
  - Current player chooses next player.  
- Communication restriction lifted: Players may say “I want to go next” or “I don’t have a good play,” but not reveal hand contents.  
- Spades played earlier now activate if enemy was Spade-type.  
- Clubs played earlier do not retroactively double.  

#### Defeated Enemy Cards  
- When drawn or held, defeated royals (Jacks, Queens, Kings) have:  
  - Value: 10 (Jack), 15 (Queen), 20 (King)  
  - Suit power applies normally when played.  

#### Solo Play  
- Two Jesters placed face up at setup.  
- At start of Step 1 or Step 4, flip a Jester to:  
  - Discard entire hand  
  - Draw up to 8 cards  
- Does not cancel immunity.  
- Can be used twice per game.  
- Victory tiers:  
  - 2 Jesters used: Bronze  
  - 1 Jester used: Silver  
  - 0 Jesters used: Gold  

#### Communication  
- No hints about hand contents.  
- Allowed: reminders of public info (e.g., “3 cards left in Tavern,” “I have 2 cards”).  
- Prohibited: “I have a Club,” “Play a Heart,” “I can finish the enemy.”  
- Exception: After Jester play, players may express desire/reluctance to go next.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I play a combo of 3 Aces?**  
A: No. Aces cannot be in combos. They can only be paired with one other card.  

**Q: Do Spades played before a Jester now work on a Spade enemy?**  
A: Yes. After Jester is played, prior Spade plays begin reducing the enemy’s attack.  

**Q: Do Clubs played before a Jester now double on a Club enemy?**  
A: No. Only future Club plays benefit from the power.  

**Q: Can I yield if I have no cards?**  
A: No. You must be able to play or yield. If you can do neither, the game is lost.  

**Q: Can I play an Ace with a Jester?**  
A: No. Aces cannot be paired with Jesters.  

**Q: What happens if the Tavern Deck is empty during a Diamond draw?**  
A: Draw as many as possible. No penalty.  

**Q: Can I play a single Ace?**  
A: Yes. It counts as 1 damage and activates its suit power.  

**Q: Can I play two Aces together?**  
A: Yes, as a pair: Ace + one other card (including another Ace). X = sum (e.g., Ace + Ace = 2). Apply both suit powers.
