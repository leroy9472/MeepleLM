# Oceans - Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Oceans simulates a dynamic underwater ecosystem where players evolve species to survive and thrive. The foundation begins with phytoplankton in the Reef, supporting zooplankton and predators, up to apex predators and filter feeders. The goal is to score the most points by cultivating species populations, increasing their numbers, evolving traits, and adapting to changing environmental conditions.

### 2. Components
- 28 Species Boards (unlimited supply)
- 1 Reef board
- 248 Population tokens:
  - 120 blue
  - 32 aqua
  - 32 yellow
  - 32 red
  - 32 orange
- 80 Trait Cards (8 of each Surface trait)
- 20 Scenario Cards
- 5 Score Screens (or bags)
- 5 Player Aids
- Face-down deck of shuffled trait cards
- Reserve bag for set-aside population tokens

### 3. Setup
- Each player receives a Score Screen.
- Place the Reef, Species Boards, and shuffled trait card deck in the center.
- Prepare population tokens based on player count:
  - 2 players: 120 total (only blue tokens)
  - 3 players: 152 total (blue + 1 set of 32)
  - 4 players: 184 total (blue + 2 sets of 32)
  - 5 players: 216 total (blue + 3 sets of 32)
  - 6 players: 216 total (using expansion tokens)
- Set aside reserve population tokens for final turn use.
- Set up the Ocean:
  - Place 3 random light-colored Scenario Cards in a line next to the Reef.
  - Place 1 random dark-colored Scenario Card at the end of the line.
- Divide mixed population tokens into 4 roughly equal piles; place one pile on each Scenario Card.
- Deal 5 face-down trait cards to each player.
- Determine first player (most recently visited ocean, or randomly).
- Flip top card from deck to discard pile; number indicates initial food in Reef. Each player takes tokens from any one Scenario Card pile.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn, complete these four phases in order:

#### 1) Play Cards Phase (2 actions)
Choose two actions (same or different):
- **Evolve**: Play a card to create a new species or add to an existing one.
  - New species: Take a Species Board, place 1 population from first available Scenario Card, place trait face-up to the right.
  - Position can be left, right, or between existing species; cannot be moved later.
  - Existing species: Add trait (max 3 traits per species unless trait allows more).
  - Additive traits (Tentacled, Cleaning, Symbiotic, Bottom Feeding, Parasitic) can be duplicated.
- **Migrate**: Discard a card to move population tokens equal to its migrate number.
  - Move tokens from any single source (Ocean or Reef) to any other single pile.
  - Must take all from one source; cannot combine sources.
- **Remove Traits**: Remove and discard any number of your traits "for free" during this phase.
  - Surface cards go to discard pile; Deep cards are removed from game.

#### 2) Feeding Phase
Choose one of three feeding methods:
- **Leech**: All your leeching species (e.g., Parasitic) take population from adjacent species.
  - Cannot be blocked by defensive traits.
  - Must meet leech requirements (e.g., larger population for Parasitic).
- **Forage**: Choose one species to take population from Reef.
  - Base: 1 population; add Forage values from traits.
  - Species must have space on board.
- **Attack**: Choose one species to attack another.
  - Take population equal to attacker’s Attack minus defender’s Defense.
  - Must gain at least 1 population.
  - Cannot attack if blocked by defensive traits (e.g., Inking, Schooling, Transparency, Apex Predator).
- **Overpopulation Check**: After feeding, if species has 10th population (on fishbones), immediately move 4 to Reef. Repeat if still overpopulated.

#### 3) Aging Phase
- Score population from each species:
  - Before Cambrian Explosion: 1 per species
  - After Cambrian Explosion: 2 per species
- Place scored population behind Score Screen.
- Species with 0 population after aging go extinct:
  - Remove all traits (to discard pile or removed from game)
  - Return Species Board to supply
  - Take 2 population from any Ocean pile and place in Reef

#### 4) Discard & Draw Phase
- Discard any number of cards from hand.
- Draw back up to 5 cards from deck.
- Reshuffle discard pile if deck runs out.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Cambrian Explosion**: Triggered when Ocean Zone 1 is emptied. After this:
  - Play 2 cards in Play Cards phase
  - Age 2 population per species
  - Deep cards become playable
- **Interconnected Ecosystem**: Species form a circle; leftmost of one player is adjacent to rightmost of another.
- **Scenario Cards**:
  - Light-colored (ongoing): Activate when pile is empty; deactivate when population returned.
  - Dark-colored (events): Trigger when pile empties; may trigger multiple times.
- **Trait Types**:
  - **Defensive Traits** (black text box): Take priority in conflicts (e.g., Inking reduces attack damage).
  - **Non-Defensive Traits**: Provide abilities like gaining, foraging, or attacking.
- **Gaining Population**: Triggered by traits; take from first Scenario Card with tokens.
- **Extinction**: Only occurs during Aging phase when species cannot age fully.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **End Game Trigger**: When a player must take population from Ocean but none is available.
- **Final Turn**: Completing player finishes turn. All other players receive bonus:
  - 1 point per species (placed behind Score Screen)
- Use set-aside tokens to fulfill final actions and triggered traits.
- **Final Scoring**:
  - 1 point per population behind Score Screen
  - 1 point per population on surviving species
  - 1 point per trait on surviving species
- Winner: Highest total. Tiebreaker: Most trait cards on surviving species.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a species attack itself?** Yes, but must gain at least 1 population.
- **Can a species be adjacent to itself?** No.
- **Can a species attack if it won't gain population?** No.
- **When does a Scenario Card activate?** After all feeding triggers resolve, before overpopulation check.
- **Extinction timing**: Only during Aging phase. Species with 0 population survive until next aging.
- **Trait conflicts**: Defensive traits take priority (e.g., Inking overrides Apex Predator’s attack strength).
