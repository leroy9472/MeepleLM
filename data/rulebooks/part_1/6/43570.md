### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows three phases:

#### Phase 1: Draw 2 World Cards  
- Draw 2 cards from the World deck.  
- Choose **one** to fight; discard the other to the World discard pile.  
- Place the chosen World card in front of you.  

#### Phase 2: Fight the World  
- The World card indicates:  
  - **Draw X**: Number of free Fighting cards you may draw.  
  - **World Value**: Three values (Green, Yellow, Red); use the one matching the current step.  
- Draw **1 Fighting card** to begin. Continue drawing up to the "Draw X" limit for free (placed to the left of the World card).  
- After exhausting free draws:  
  - Each additional card costs **1 life point**.  
  - Paid cards are placed to the **right** of the World card.  
- You may **stop drawing at any time**, even if you haven’t beaten the World value.  
- **Special Abilities**:  
  - May be used **anytime after drawing at least one card**.  
  - Use only **once per fight**; mark by rotating the card 90°.  
  - Order of use is flexible; resolve one fully before starting another.  

#### Phase 3: Resolve the Fight  
- **If you win** (Fighting value ≥ World value):  
  - Discard all used Fighting cards to the Fighting discard pile.  
  - Discard the World card to the **Fighting discard pile** (it becomes a new Fighting card in future reshuffles).  
- **If you lose** (Fighting value < World value):  
  - Calculate difference: **World value – Fighting value = life points lost**.  
  - Lose that many life points.  
  - For each life point lost, you may **permanently remove one Fighting card** used in the fight.  
    - Removing a **Drama/Trauma card** requires **at least 2 life points lost**.  
    - You may remove up to the number of life points lost (e.g., lose 3 LP → remove up to 3 cards).  
  - Discard undefeated World card to **World discard pile**.  
  - Discard remaining Fighting cards (not removed) to Fighting discard pile.  

#### Deck Cycling  
- When the **Fighting deck is empty** and you need to draw:  
  - Shuffle the **Fighting discard pile** into a new deck.  
  - **Before** shuffling, add **1 Drama/Trauma card** from the top of the stack (face-down, unseen).  
- When the **World deck is empty**:  
  - Shuffle the **World discard pile** into a new World deck.  
  - Advance the **Step Counter** to the next color (Green → Yellow → Red).
