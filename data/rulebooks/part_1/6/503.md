## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the roles of Tuareg leaders guiding caravans across the Sahara Desert. The objective is to expand caravans strategically to score the most points by securing watering holes, linking to oases, enclosing territories, and building the largest caravans of each color.

2. Components  
- 1 double-sided game board (Mountain side and River side)  
- 175 Pastel Camels (35 each in 5 colors: pink, yellow, green, turquoise, purple)  
- 5 Gray Camels (used as player markers)  
- 30 Plastic Riders (6 in each of 5 colors)  
- 5 Plastic Palm Trees (Oasis Markers)  
- 45 Waterhole Tokens (15 each valued at 1, 2, and 3 points)  
- 15 x 10-point Caravan Tokens (one per camel color)  
- 29 x 5-point Tokens  
- 5 Leader Color Markers (Gray Camels with Riders)

Note: Riders must be attached to camels before first play to form "Leaders" — one rider of each color per camel color, resulting in 30 unique Leader combinations.

3. Setup  
a. Board Placement  
- Place the board with either Mountain or River side up.  
- For 2 or 3 players, use only the area inside the elevation line (shaded area is inactive).

b. Assemble Leaders  
- Attach each rider to a different-colored camel to create 30 unique Leaders.  
- Return unused Gray Camels (with riders of unchosen colors) to the box.

c. Player Setup  
- Each player chooses a rider color and takes 6 Leaders in that color.  
- Place the Gray Camel with matching rider in front as a player marker.  
- In a 5-player game, each player returns one Leader (on a pastel camel) to the box, ensuring all returned Leaders are on different camel colors.

d. Camel Supply  
- Place remaining riderless camels near the board, sorted by color.  
- Return camels to the box based on player count:  
  - 2 players: 8 camels of each color  
  - 3 players: 4 camels of each color  
  - 4–5 players: none

e. Oases  
- Randomly place 5 Palm Trees on vacant Large Pool spaces (one per space).  
- Not all Large Pool spaces will have oases.

f. Waterhole Tokens  
- Shuffle the 45 Waterhole Tokens face-down.  
- Place one token face-up on each Small Pool space and each Large Pool space without a Palm Tree.  
- Return unused tokens to the box.  
- Variant (Aquifers): Place tokens face-down instead.

g. Scoring Supplies  
- Place 10-point Caravan Tokens, 5-point Tokens, and Caravan Markers near the board.

h. Starting Player  
- Youngest player goes first (alternative: last player to drink water).

i. Leader Placement  
- Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player places one Leader (excluding the Gray one) per turn until all are placed.  
- Placement rules:  
  - Cannot place on a space with a Waterhole, Oasis, Mountain, or another Leader.  
  - Cannot place adjacent to an Oasis or any other Leader.  
  - First Leader placed by each player must be on a camel color not yet used by any other player’s first Leader.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Turns proceed clockwise.  
- On each turn, a player must place exactly two camels.  
- Exception (First Turn Placement):  
  - In 3–5 player games: First two players place only one camel on their first turn.  
  - In 2-player games: Only the first player places one camel; the second player places two.  
- After this, all players place two camels per turn.

5. Core Mechanics  
a. Camel Placement  
- Each camel must be placed adjacent to a camel in a caravan of the same color that belongs to the player.  
- A caravan belongs to a player if it contains a Leader of their color.  
- Caravans may fork (no need to form a straight line).  
- Cannot place on:  
  - Mountains  
  - Oases (spaces with Palm Trees)  
  - Spaces occupied by another camel  
  - Enclosed areas  
- May place adjacent to camels of different colors (any player).  
- Cannot place adjacent to a camel of the same color if it belongs to another player (caravans cannot merge).

b. Scoring During Play  
- Waterholes:  
  - When placing a camel on a Waterhole space, take the token and keep it face-down.  
  - Value is revealed only at game end.  
- Oases:  
  - When placing a camel adjacent to an Oasis, take a 5-point token (face-up).  
  - Each caravan (one color, one player) can score each Oasis only once.  
  - A caravan may link to multiple Oases.  
  - Multiple caravans (same or different players) may link to the same Oasis.  
- Enclosed Areas:  
  - An area is enclosed when a single caravan (one color, one player) completely surrounds a group of empty hexes, using:  
    - Its own camels  
    - Board edges  
    - Mountains  
  - The enclosed area must contain no camels or Leaders of any kind.  
  - When enclosing:  
    - Take all Waterhole Tokens inside (face-down).  
    - Take a 5-point token for each Oasis inside that the enclosing caravan had not previously linked to.  
  - After enclosure, no camel may be placed inside the area.  
  - At game end, each empty space in the enclosed area scores 1 point.

c. Variant Rules  
- River Board:  
  - During setup, Leaders may be placed adjacent to the river (other rules unchanged).  
  - First time a caravan crosses the river, take a 5-point token (only once per caravan).  
- Serpentine Leader Placement:  
  - Instead of clockwise order, place Leaders in serpentine order (e.g., ABCD → DCBA → ABCD in a 4-player game).  
- Aquifers:  
  - Waterhole Tokens are placed face-down during setup.  
  - Players may secretly view their collected Waterhole Tokens during the game.

6. Scoring & End Game  
a. Game End  
- The game ends at the end of the turn in which the last camel of any one color is placed.  
- If a player cannot place a camel on their turn, the game ends immediately.

b. Final Scoring  
- Largest Caravan:  
  - For each camel color, the player with the most camels in a single caravan of that color takes the 10-point token.  
  - If tied, all tied players take a 5-point token; no one takes the 10-point token.  
- Enclosed Areas:  
  - Score 1 point per empty space within each enclosed area (excluding Oasis spaces).  
  - Waterhole spaces (even if previously occupied) count as empty.  
- Waterhole Tokens:  
  - Add values of all collected Waterhole Tokens (face-down).  
- Oases:  
  - Add 5 points for each Oasis token collected.  
- Total all points.  
- The player with the highest score wins.  
- In case of a tie, players share victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can a caravan use multiple colors to enclose an area?  
  → No. Only one caravan (same color, one player) can enclose an area.  
- Can I place a camel next to my own caravan of a different color?  
  → Yes. Only same-color adjacency with another player’s caravan is prohibited.  
- Can I place a camel in a space adjacent to an Oasis my caravan has already linked to?  
  → Yes. No additional points, but placement is allowed.  
- Do enclosed areas include oases in their point total?  
  → No. Empty spaces only; oases contribute only if newly linked during enclosure.  
- What if I run out of 5-point tokens?  
  → Use substitutes. Scoring continues regardless of token availability.  
- Can I enclose an area that contains a Waterhole or Oasis?  
  → Yes, as long as no camels or leaders are inside. Waterholes and oases inside contribute to immediate scoring.  
- Can I place a camel on a space that was part of an Oasis but now only has a Waterhole?  
  → Yes. If a Palm Tree is not present, it's a normal space with a Waterhole.  
- Does the Gray Camel with rider play in the game?  
  → No. It is only a player color marker.
