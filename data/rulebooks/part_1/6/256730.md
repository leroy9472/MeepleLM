# Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
The government is privatizing its oil industry. Players compete to build the most profitable oil company by purchasing crude oil, refining it through their pipeline network, fulfilling contracts and orders, and selling refined oil on the market. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.

3. Randomly place Refined Market Tiles on all 18 Refined Oil locations.
4. Fill Crude Market and Crude rows of Refined Markets with matching color Oil Barrels.
5. Separate Contracts by oil grade. Set aside: 2-3 players: 4 per grade; 4 players: 5 per grade. Discard rest.
6. Place Contract stacks next to corresponding rows. Fill display, leaving rightmost space empty with <4 players.
7. Separate Orders by quantity needed (3, 4, or 5). Fill display, leaving rightmost space empty with <4 players.
8. Randomly select 5 Upgrade types. Place Level 1, 2, 3 cards in rows. Place Upgrade Token face-up next to each Level 1.
9. Fill Machine Shop with Machine tiles. Fill Tank Shop with Tank tiles.
10. Fill 4 Government Quadrants with 1 Pipe per space.
11. Display 2 Pipes per player next to Machine Shop and Tank Shop.
12. Place 1 random Action Tile on each of 8 Action spaces.
13. Place 1 random Refinement Cost Marker on each Refinement Cost space, white-side up.
14. Display 3 random Valuation Cards and Valuation Tile.
15. Each player chooses color and takes:

   - 1 Oil Barrel in each color (on 0 space of Pipeline Track)
   - 1 Worker
   - 1 Disc
   - $40
16. Randomly choose start player. They place disk on upper left Player Order space. Others follow clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Game lasts 3 Years: Year 1 (8 rounds), Year 2 (6 rounds), Year 3 (4 rounds)
- Each round: Players take turns in order
- Each turn: Work Phase → Machine Phase
- After Year 1 and Year 2: Refresh Phase
- After Year 3: End Game Scoring

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Work Phase
**Main Action**: Place worker on:
- Any Action space in center cross (occupied or not)
- Government Pipe Tile
- Own Pipe Network
- Or Pass

**Secondary Action**: If main action was on center cross, pay $10 to move worker to adjacent action space and take that action.

**Turn Order**: After completing any action with Turn Order icon, may move disk to desired position on lower Turn Order Track, shifting others as needed.

#### Machine Phase
Pay $15 to activate any number of Machines in your Pipe Network. All Machines run simultaneously. Oil cannot be refined multiple times in same phase.

#### Running Pipeline Network
- Place worker on any Pipe in your network (not connected to Machine)
- May refine 1 Oil Barrel for each Pipeline passing through that tile
- Pipeline: unbroken length of same-color pipe
- Refinement Value = number of connected segments
- To refine, Pipeline's Refinement Value must ≥ Refinement Cost
- Can refine multiple steps at once if Refinement Value ≥ sum of costs
- Only need tank space for final grade
- Move refined barrel to appropriate tank row

#### Government Pipe Tiles
- Place worker on Pipe in open quadrant
- 1st Year: Up to 2 quadrants open
- 2nd Year: Up to 3 quadrants open  
- 3rd Year: All 4 quadrants open
- Must purchase tile worker is on
- May purchase adjacent tiles (not diagonal)
- Cost: 1:$5, 2:$10, 3:$20, 4:$35, 5:$55
- Place pipes in your network

#### Filling Contracts & Orders
May be done anytime during Work and Machine Phases, but not during main/secondary actions.

**Contracts**:
- May fulfill multiple per turn
- Each contract only once per year
- Place oil barrels from board onto contract
- Receive money based on grade
- Deferred contracts cannot be filled

**Orders**:
- Take available Order tile and place next to board
- Place correct oil barrels from board onto tile
- Receive money based on grade
- Must fulfill completely when taken

### 6. Scoring & End Game
After all players take 4th turn in Year 3:
1. Flip Refinement Cost Markers in column 3
2. Incomplete Contracts: Remove, receive 1 Penalty Cube each
3. Score remaining Oil Barrels on board
4. Score each Pipeline based on highest grade it can refine crude to in single run
5. Score Valuation Cards and Valuation Tile
6. Lose money for each Penalty Cube
7. Add remaining cash

Player with most total money wins. Tiebreaker: Player Order Track.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Pipeline Connections**: New pipes must connect orthogonally to existing network. Colors don't need to match.
- **Machine Placement**: Machines cover exactly half of one pipe tile. They bisect pipelines.
- **Refinement Costs**: Shown on board. Sum costs for multiple steps (e.g., Crude→Mid = Crude→Low + Low→Mid).
- **Turn Order**: Players not changing order slide disk to leftmost space on lower track.
- **Valuation Cards**: Each has specific scoring condition (see Appendix 2).
- **Upgrades**: Must be purchased in order (1→2→3). After purchasing, may flip additional token to block others.
