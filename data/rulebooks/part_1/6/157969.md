## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Sheriff of Nottingham*, players are merchants smuggling goods into the city under the watchful eye of the Sheriff. Prince John’s oppressive taxes have made honest trade nearly impossible, so contraband is essential for profit. The Sheriff's job is to inspect bags and enforce the law—but bribery and bluffing are common.  

**Objective**: Become the wealthiest merchant by accumulating the most points through:  
- Selling goods (legal and contraband) at market  
- Earning King and Queen bonuses for dominating certain goods  
- Managing bribes and penalties wisely  

The game ends when all players have served as Sheriff twice (thrice in a 3-player game). The player with the highest score wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has five phases:  
1. **Market**  
2. **Load Merchant Bag**  
3. **Declaration**  
4. **Inspection**  
5. **End of Round**  

Play proceeds clockwise starting from the Sheriff’s left. Only merchants act in Phases 1–3. Sheriff acts only in Phase 4.

#### Phase 1: Market  
Each merchant:  
- Sets aside 0–5 cards face-down.  
- Draws same number from:  
  - Discard piles (any order, top-down)  
  - Or draw pile (only if no discards drawn yet)  
- After drawing, places set-aside cards face-up on **one** discard pile in any order.  
> If draw pile empties: shuffle all but top 5 cards of each discard pile to form new draw pile.

#### Phase 2: Load Merchant Bag  
All merchants simultaneously:  
- Place **1–5 cards** into their bag (cannot be 0 or more than 5).  
- Seal bag. Contents are secret until inspection or reveal.

#### Phase 3: Declaration  
Starting left of Sheriff, each merchant:  
- Hands bag to Sheriff.  
- Declares:  
  - **Exact number** of cards (must be truthful)  
  - **One type** of **legal good** (may lie about contents)  
> Example: “I have 4 Chickens” — even if bag contains 2 Chickens, 1 Cheese, 1 Silk.

#### Phase 4: Inspection & Negotiation  
Sheriff chooses inspection order. For each bag:  
- May **threaten** inspection.  
- Player may offer **bribe**:  
  - Gold  
  - Goods from Merchant Stand (legal or contraband)  
  - Goods claimed to be in bag (may be false)  
  - Promises of future favors (non-binding beyond current round)  
- Sheriff decides:  
  - **Return bag unopened** → All contents go to Merchant Stand: legal face-up, contraband face-down.  
  - **Open bag** → Reveal contents.  

##### Outcomes of Inspection:  
- **True Declaration** (all cards match declared type):  
  - Sheriff pays player penalty × number of cards.  
  - All cards go to Merchant Stand face-up.  
- **False Declaration** (any mismatch):  
  - Only **correctly declared cards** go to Merchant Stand.  
  - All **other cards** are **confiscated**:  
    - Placed on one discard pile (Sheriff chooses which, in any order).  
    - Player pays Sheriff penalty value for each confiscated card.  

> **Gambler’s Risk (promo)**: Can be declared before deal is finalized. If used:  
> - Penalties **double** if Sheriff loses (false declaration).  
> - If both players use it, penalties **quadruple**.  
> - Cannot be revoked once declared.

#### Phase 5: End of Round  
- If all players have been Sheriff enough times → **Game ends**.  
- Otherwise:  
  - Pass Sheriff marker to left.  
  - All players draw up to **6 cards**.  
  - Next round begins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Bluffing & Negotiation**: Central to gameplay. Players lie about contents and bribe Sheriff.  
- **Card Tracking**: Players may examine discard piles at any time.  
- **Penalty Payments**:  
  - Pay with gold first.  
  - If no gold: pay with **legal goods** (value ≥ penalty).  
  - If no legal goods: pay with **contraband**.  
  - Remaining debt forgiven if unable to pay.  
- **Honor Among Thieves**:  
  - Deals must be honored if fulfillable in current turn.  
  - Future favors (e.g., “I won’t inspect you next time”) are **not binding**.  
  - If bribe includes goods “in bag,” only actual contents must be paid.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends when all players have been Sheriff:  
- **Twice** (4–5 players)  
- **Thrice** (3 players)  

**Scoring**:  
- **Value of all cards in Merchant Stand** (legal and contraband)  
- **Gold on hand**  
- **King & Queen Bonuses**:  
  - **King**: Most of a legal good → 15 points  
  - **Queen**: Second-most → 5 points  
  - Royal Goods count as 2–3 of matching good for King/Queen  
  - **Tie for King**: Combine 15 + 5 = 20, divide among tied, **round down**. No Queen bonus.  
  - **Tie for Queen**: Split 5 points equally, round down.  

> **Feast Plate (promo)**: Counts as any legal good at endgame. Chosen in clockwise order from first Sheriff. Affects King/Queen.  

> **Arcane Scrolls (promo)**: If smuggled, player is **ineligible** for King/Queen bonuses. If only qualified player has one, **no one** gets bonus.  

**Final Score =**  
- Card values  
- + Gold  
- + Bonuses  

**Tiebreaker**:  
1. Most Legal Goods  
2. Most Contraband Goods
