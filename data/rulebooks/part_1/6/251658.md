### 1. Lore & Objective
Sprawlopolis is a city-building puzzle game where players design a city by placing zone tiles (Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Park) and roads to fulfill unique scoring conditions. Each game uses three randomly selected scoring cards, and players aim to maximize their score based on these objectives. Optional special elements like Points of Interest (e.g., School, Power Plant, Beach) introduce additional scoring mechanics.

### 2. Components
- Zone tiles: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Park
- Road tiles
- Scoring cards (48 unique conditions listed)
- Optional: Points of Interest tiles (e.g., School, Stadium, Beach, Labyrinth, etc.)
- Scoring postcard or sheet

### 3. Setup
1. Shuffle the deck of scoring cards and randomly select three.
2. Reveal the three scoring cards; these determine how players will score points this game.
3. Each player starts with an empty grid (typically 8x8 or similar).
4. If using a Point of Interest (from expansions or campaign play), place it according to its rules before building begins.
5. Players take turns placing one tile (zone or road) per turn until all have passed consecutively.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. On your turn, place one zone tile or road tile adjacent to existing tiles (or start in the center for first move).
2. Tiles must connect logically (roads to roads, zones to zones).
3. Players may pass at any time.
4. Game ends when all players pass in succession.
5. Score each of the three selected scoring cards.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Zone Types:
- **Residential (Resid.)**
- **Commercial**
- **Industrial**
- **Park**
- **Roads** – linear paths connecting zones; may be straight or curved

#### Grouping:
- Zones of the same type that are orthogonally adjacent form a group.
- Roads that connect form a single road; length is measured in segments.

#### Scoring Conditions (Selected from 48):

  +2pt per Industrial block, –1pt per non-Industrial block adjacent to any Industrial block.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends when all players pass consecutively.
- Each player evaluates their city against the three revealed scoring cards.
- Sum all points from the three cards.
- Highest total wins.
- Tiebreaker: fewest total blocks (compact city wins).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Roads**: A road is continuous if connected by segments. Curves are allowed but may affect scoring (e.g., Runways).
- **Groups**: Only orthogonally adjacent (up/down/left/right) same-type blocks form a group. Diagonals do not count.
- **Scoring Overlap**: Multiple scoring conditions can apply to the same block or road.
- **Negative Scores**: Allowed unless otherwise restricted.
- **Ties**: Resolved by fewest total blocks.
- **Points of Interest**: Placed before building begins. Their effects are active for all scoring.
