# Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Fellowship seeks to guide the Ringbearer into Mordor to destroy the One Ring. Sauron’s forces seek to intercept and defeat the Ringbearer before this can happen, or overwhelm the Shire with darkness. The game simulates the final confrontation between good and evil in Middle-earth.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Game Board depicting regions from the Shire to Mordor  
- 18 Character Tiles (9 Fellowship, 9 Sauron) — double-sided (Classic: Ring symbol; Variant: Star symbol)  
- 18 Plastic Character Stands (9 light for Fellowship, 9 dark for Sauron)  
- 18 Combat Cards (9 per player)  
- 8 Special Cards (4 per player)  
- 2 Reference Sheets  
- 18 Character Tokens (for Draft variant)  

### 3. Setup  
- One player controls the Fellowship, the other controls Sauron.  
- Each player places their 9 character tiles into stands, hiding identities from opponent.  
- **Fellowship Player**:  
  - Places 4 characters in the Shire.  
  - Places 1 character each in Arthedain, Cardolan, Enedwaith, Eregion, Rhudaur.  
- **Sauron Player**:  
  - Places 4 characters in Mordor.  
  - Places 1 character each in Gondor, Dagorlad, Fangorn, Mirkwood, Rohan.  
- No characters may start in mountain regions.  
- Each player takes their 9 Combat Cards into hand.  
- Special Cards are set aside if used (optional variant).  
- The Shire points toward the Fellowship player; Mordor toward Sauron player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Sauron moves first**; turns alternate.  
2. On your turn:  
   - Move one character forward to an adjacent region.  
   - If movement causes overlap with enemy, a **battle** occurs.  
   - Resolve all battles in the region before turn ends.  
3. After all battles, turn passes to opponent.  
4. Game ends when a win condition is met.

#### Movement Rules  
- Characters **must move forward** unless special ability allows otherwise.  
- **No sideways movement in mountains** (even via cards or abilities).  
- **Only Fellowship** may use:  
  - **Tunnel of Moria** (Eregion → Fangorn). Movement is one-way.  
  - **River Anduin downstream** (Mirkwood → Fangorn → Rohan).  
- **Region Limits**:  
  - Shire and Mordor: max 4 characters per side  
  - Mountains (Caradhras, etc.): max 1 character per side  
  - All other regions: max 2 characters per side  
- A character cannot move into a region at capacity.  
- Players may **shuffle characters** in a region to hide identities (cannot mix regions or shuffle revealed characters).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Battle Sequence  
1. **Reveal Characters**:  
   - Attacker and defender reveal identities.  
2. **Resolve Character Abilities (in order)**:  
   - **Fellowship resolves first**, except when Warg is involved (Fellowship text is ignored).  
   - Retreats (e.g., Frodo sideways, Pippin backward) occur now.  
   - Instant defeats (e.g., Gimli vs. Orcs, Merry vs. Witch King) occur now.  
   - If a character retreats successfully, Sauron’s ability (except Warg) is ignored.  
3. **Play Cards**:  
   - Both players secretly choose one Combat Card.  
   - Reveal simultaneously.  
   - **Text Cards resolve before Strength Cards**.  
   - If both play Text Cards, **Sauron resolves first**.  
4. **Compare Strengths**:  
   - Add Strength Card value (if any) to character’s base strength.  
   - Lower total loses; tie = both lose.  
   - Defeated characters are removed; retreated characters are not defeated.  
   - Used cards are discarded face-up.  
5. **Post-Battle**:  
   - If more enemies remain, new battle begins.  
   - All non-defeated revealed characters are hidden again.
