# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Players are settlers colonizing the island of Catan, competing to build settlements, cities, and roads. The goal is to be the first to reach 10 victory points (VPs) through expansion, trade, and strategic development.

## 2. Components
- 19 terrain hexes (4 forest, 4 pasture, 4 field, 3 hill, 3 mountain, 1 desert)
- 6 sea frame pieces
- 9 harbor tokens (4 generic 3:1, 1 each of 2:1 for wood, brick, wool, grain, ore)
- 18 number tokens (2–12, excluding 7)
- 95 Resource Cards (19 each: lumber, brick, wool, grain, ore)
- 25 Development Cards:
  - 14 Knight
  - 2 Road Building
  - 2 Monopoly
  - 2 Year of Plenty
  - 5 Victory Point
- 60 roads (15 per player)
- 20 settlements (5 per player)
- 16 cities (4 per player)
- 2 dice (1 red, 1 yellow)
- 1 robber
- 4 Building Costs cards
- 2 special cards: Longest Road, Largest Army

## 3. Setup
1. Assemble the sea frame by matching edge numbers.
2. Randomly place 19 terrain hexes within the frame.
3. Randomly place 9 harbor tokens on coastal edges.
4. Place number tokens in alphabetical order (A–R) counter-clockwise from a coastal corner, skipping the desert.
5. Place the robber on the desert hex.
6. Shuffle Development Cards and place face down; sort Resource Cards into face-up stacks.
7. Place Longest Road and Largest Army cards beside the board.
8. Players roll dice; highest roll goes first (break ties as needed).
9. First round: Each player places one settlement and one adjacent road, clockwise.
10. Second round: Starting with last player, each places a second settlement and adjacent road, counter-clockwise.
11. Each player collects one resource card for each terrain hex adjacent to their second settlement.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
On a player’s turn:
1. **Roll Dice**: Sum determines which terrain hexes produce resources.
2. **Resource Production**:
   - Each settlement on a producing hex yields 1 resource.
   - Each city yields 2 resources.
   - If a 7 is rolled: no production, players with >7 cards discard half (rounded down), active player moves robber and steals 1 card from a player adjacent to the new robber hex.
3. **Trade**:
   - Trade with active player only (domestic).
   - Maritime trade: 4:1 with bank, 3:1 with any harbor settlement, or 2:1 with specific resource at matching harbor.
4. **Build & Play Cards**:
   - Build roads, settlements, cities, or buy Development Cards.
   - Play one Development Card (not purchased this turn, unless it's a Victory Point card used to win).
5. Pass dice to next player.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Roads**: Cost 1 brick + 1 lumber. Must connect to existing road, settlement, or city. First to 5+ continuous roads gains Longest Road (2 VP); if overtaken, card transfers.
- **Settlements**: Cost 1 brick + 1 lumber + 1 wool + 1 grain. Must connect to own road and obey Distance Rule (no adjacent settlement/city on neighboring intersections).
- **Cities**: Cost 3 ore + 2 grain. Upgrade from settlement (return settlement to supply). Yield double resources.
- **Development Cards**: Cost 1 wool + 1 grain + 1 ore. Draw face down. Keep secret until played.
  - **Knight**: Move robber, steal 1 card. Played face up. Counts toward Largest Army (3+ knights, most wins 2 VP).
  - **Road Building**: Place 2 free roads.
  - **Monopoly**: Name a resource; all others give you all of that type.
  - **Year of Plenty**: Take any 2 resource cards.
  - **Victory Point**: Worth 1 VP, revealed only when winning.
- **Robber**: Moved on 7 or Knight. Blocks production on its hex. Steal from adjacent player.
- **Distance Rule**: No settlement may be built on an intersection adjacent to another settlement or city.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends immediately when a player reaches 10+ VPs on their turn.
Scoring:
- Settlement: 1 VP
- City: 2 VP
- Longest Road: 2 VP (5+ continuous road segments)
- Largest Army: 2 VP (most Knight cards played, minimum 3)
- Victory Point Development Cards: 1 VP each

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Resource Shortage**: If not enough of a resource to satisfy all claims, no player receives that resource.
- **Playing Development Cards**: Only one per turn; cannot play same turn purchased, except Victory Point cards used to reach 10 VPs.
- **Longest Road**: Only the longest continuous segment counts. Branches ignored. If broken, card may return to bank if no clear leader.
- **Largest Army**: Only Knight cards count. Must play (not just own) more than current holder to take card.
- **Starting Resources**: Only second settlement yields starting resources.
- **Trading**: Only active player can trade with others. No player-to-player trades outside active player’s turn.
