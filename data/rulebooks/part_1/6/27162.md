## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Kingsburg*, players take on the role of provincial governors tasked with developing their region under the protection of the King. Over five years, they must influence royal advisors to gather resources, construct buildings, and defend against annual invasions. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) by building an impressive province, gaining royal rewards, and succeeding in battle.

### 2. Components
- Game board with Calendar Track, Year Track, Scoring Track, Soldiers Chart, and Turn Order Chart
- Advisor cards (numbered 1–18) with unique rewards
- Player boards with building grids and resource costs
- Colored dice (3 per player)
- White dice (used as bonuses)
- Goods cubes: Wood, Gold, Stone
- “+2” tokens (used to boost die rolls)
- King’s Envoy marker
- Soldier tokens
- Destiny Cards (Expansion)
- Enemy deck (divided by year)
- Player discs for scoring, soldiers, and turn order

### 3. Setup
- Place the season marker on “Aid from the King” (Phase 1) and the year marker on Year 1.
- Each player places their scoring marker at 0 on the Scoring Track, soldier marker at 0 on the Soldiers Chart, and turn order disc on a random number on the Turn Order Chart.
- Place goods, white dice, and “+2” tokens near the board.
- Shuffle the Enemy deck per year; place face down.
- (Expansion) Prepare Destiny Cards.
- First turn only: Each player chooses one good of their choice.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds over five years. Each year follows eight phases:

#### Phase 1: Aid from the King
- The player with the fewest buildings receives a white die for use in Spring.
- Tiebreaker: Fewest goods. If still tied, all tied players take one good of choice (no white die awarded).
- (Expansion) Reveal a new Destiny Card for the year.

#### Phase 2: Spring (Productive Season)
a) **Roll Dice and Adjust Turn Order**  
All players roll their dice. Lowest total goes first. Ties retain prior turn order positions.  
b) **Influence King’s Advisors**  
In turn order, players place dice (or pass) on advisors matching the sum exactly.  
- White dice and “+2” tokens may be used, but only with at least one colored die.  
- Only one “+2” token may be used per season.  
- Passing ends a player’s participation.  
c) **Receive Help from the Advisors**  
Resolve advisors from lowest to highest number. Collect rewards (resources, soldiers, VPs, etc.). Return dice and used tokens.  
d) **Construct Buildings**  
In turn order, each player may construct one building (paying its cost). Buildings must be built left to right in their row.  
- Exception: King’s Envoy allows a double build.

#### Phase 3: The King’s Reward
- The player(s) with the most buildings gains +1 VP. All tied players receive the point.

#### Phase 4: Summer (Productive Season)
Identical to Phase 2 (Spring).

#### Phase 5: The King’s Envoy
- The player with the fewest buildings receives the King’s Envoy marker.
- Tiebreaker: Fewest goods. If still tied, no one receives it.
- If a player still holds the Envoy from last year and hasn’t used it, they lose it now.
- The Envoy can be used once before next Phase 5:
  - Influence an advisor already occupied, or
  - Construct two buildings in a productive season.

#### Phase 6: Autumn (Productive Season)
Identical to Phase 2 (Spring).

#### Phase 7: Recruit Soldiers
- In turn order, players may spend 2 goods per soldier to recruit.
- No limit on number of soldiers.
- Soldiers are placed on the Soldiers Chart.

#### Phase 8: Winter – The Battle
a) All players simultaneously select and reveal one Soldier Token (Expansion), advancing their soldier track by its value.  
OR (Base Game): First player rolls one die; all players advance soldier track by that number.  
b) Reveal the top Enemy card.  
c) **Combat Value** = Soldier track + King’s die (from roll) + Building bonuses.  
d) Compare combat value to enemy strength:
- Higher: Victory – claim rewards.
- Equal: No reward, no penalty.
- Lower: Defeat – suffer losses (goods, buildings, VPs).
- Building destroyed: Rightmost column; if multiple, highest row.
e) The player(s) with the highest combat value **and** who were victorious gain +1 VP.
f) Reset all soldier tracks to 0.

#### End of Year
- Advance the year marker. If it is the end of Year 5, proceed to final scoring. Otherwise, begin next year at Phase 1.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### White Dice
- Can only be used with at least one colored die.
- May be split across advisors or combined in groups.
- Unlimited number can be acquired (e.g., via Farms building or Phase 1 bonus).
- Follow same placement rules as colored dice.

#### “+2” Tokens
- Unlimited tokens may be collected.
- Only one may be used per season to boost a die group.
- Can be used with white dice, but group must include at least one colored die.
- Discarded after use.

#### Buildings
- Must be built left to right in their row.
- Effects that trigger “at the end of a season” work in the season they are built.
- Each building may be used once per season unless specified.
- Player chooses order of building effects when multiple trigger.

#### Turn Order
- Determined by sum of dice rolled in productive seasons.
- Lowest sum goes first.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you use multiple “+2” tokens in a season?**  
No. Only one “+2” token may be used per season for influencing advisors. (Building abilities may allow more.)
- **Can white dice be used alone?**  
No. At least one colored die must be in the group.
- **Can you pass and then act later?**  
No. Once you pass during Influence phase, you are done for that phase.
- **Do you get the Envoy if tied in buildings and goods?**  
No. In case of tie in both, no player receives it.
- **Can you use the Envoy to influence an advisor twice?**  
No. You may influence one advisor that has already been influenced by another player.
- **Can buildings used in combat be reused later?**  
Yes, unless the building specifies one-time use.
- **Can you gain VPs from Phase 3 and Phase 8 if tied?**  
Yes. In both cases, all tied highest players receive the VP.
