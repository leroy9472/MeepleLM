## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Amun-Re*, players take on the roles of Pharaohs in ancient Egypt, competing to build the grandest pyramids and gain favor with Amun-Re through offerings. The game unfolds across two eras—the Old Kingdom and the New Kingdom—each consisting of three rounds. Victory is determined by accumulating the most Victory Points (VP) through pyramid construction, temple worship, strategic offerings, and resource management. The game ends after the New Kingdom, and the player with the highest VP total wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game consists of **2 Ages** (Old Kingdom and New Kingdom).  
Each Age consists of **3 Rounds**, each with **4 Phases**:

#### Phase 1: Auctioning Provinces  
- Draw and place one Province card per player face-up on matching board locations.  
- Include any **Immediate Bonuses** (Gold, Favor cards, Stones) as indicated in brown boxes.  
- Starting with the Start Player and proceeding clockwise:  
  - Each player places one Scribe on a bidding space of any Province card.  
  - Bids must be higher than any existing bid on that card.  
  - If outbid, on your next turn you must move your Scribe to a different Province.  
  - **Protection (x2)**: Play to block the next higher bid space on a Province.  
  - **Bribery (x2)**: Play to re-bid on the same Province after being outbid.  
- Auction ends when each Province has exactly one Scribe.  
- Players:  
  - Pay their bid in Gold to the Reserve.  
  - Leave Scribe in the Province to indicate ownership.  
  - Collect Immediate Bonuses (Gold, Favor cards to hand; Stones stay in Province).  
- Discard Province cards to a pile.

#### Phase 2: Purchases and Construction  
Starting with the Start Player:  
- **Buy Favor Cards (0–4)**:  
  - Max number = highest number of Favor symbols in any single owned Province.  
  - Cost: 1st = 1G, 2nd = 3G, 3rd = 6G, 4th = 10G.  
- **Buy Farmers**:  
  - Max = number of open Field spaces in owned Provinces.  
  - Must place immediately in empty Fields.  
  - **Free Farmer (x5)**: Play to place one Farmer anywhere (even without Field).  
- **Buy Stones**:  
  - Any number; cost follows sequence: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, etc.  
  - Must place immediately in owned Provinces.  
- **Construction**:  
  - When a Province has 3 Stones, replace them with 1 Pyramid.  
  - If a Pyramid already exists, replace both with a Double Pyramid.  
  - **Architect (x8)**: Play to build a Pyramid with only 2 Stones.  

#### Phase 3: Offerings to Amun-Re  
- Players simultaneously and secretly select:  
  - One or more Gold cards, **or**  
  - The Theft card (-3 Gold).  
  - May include one **Offering Adjustment (x4)** card to modify the collective total.  
- Reveal all offerings.  
- **Collective Offering** = sum of all Gold cards, minus 3 per Theft card.  
- In turn order, players with **Offering Adjustment** declare +3 or -3 to the total.  
- Place corresponding **Offering Tile** on the Nile Delta based on final total:  
  - 1–2: Tile "1"  
  - 3–12: Tile "3 > 12"  
  - 13–22: Tile "13 > 22"  
  - 23+: Tile "23 >"  
- **Rewards**:  
  - Highest individual offering: 3 rewards (Favor cards, Farmers, Stones in any combo).  
  - Second highest: 2 rewards.  
  - All others (who offered >0): 1 reward.  
  - **Tie**: resolved clockwise from Start Player.  
  - **Theft card**: no reward, but player steals 3 Gold and returns card to hand.  
- **New Start Player**: Player with highest individual offering (tie: clockwise order).

#### Phase 4: Harvest and Income  
Starting with Start Player:  
- **Farmers**: Each earns Gold equal to number on Offering Tile (1–4).  
- **Gold Mines**: Earn fixed Gold as shown on Province.  
- **Caravans**: Earn shown Gold **only if** Offering Tile has Camel (Tiles "1", "3 > 12").  
- **Favor Cards**:  
  - **Big Harvest (x5)**: Choose one Province; each Farmer earns +1 Gold.  
  - **Treasury (x3)**: Choose one Province; instead of normal income, gain 8 Gold.  
- All income is collected from the Reserve.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Favor Cards**:  
  - Can be discarded at any time for 1 Gold (except Theft card).  
  - Cannot play two identical cards in the same phase or scoring.  
- **Gold**: Used for bidding, purchasing, and offerings. Can be broken down at any time.  
- **Province Control**: Lasts only within an Age. After Old Kingdom, control is lost; only Pyramids and Stones remain.  
- **Stone & Pyramid Management**: Stones cannot be moved once placed. Pyramids are permanent.  
- **Simultaneous Actions**: Offerings and Harvest decisions are secret or made before income.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Intermediate Scoring (End of Each Age)  
After Round 3 of Old and New Kingdoms:  
- **Temples**: +1, +2, +3, or +4 VP each, based on current Offering Tile value.  
- **Pyramids**: +1 VP each (Double Pyramid = 2).  
- **Least-Pyramid Province Bonus**: +3 VP per Pyramid in the Province with the fewest Pyramids (0 VP if any Province has 0).  
- **Most Pyramids per River Bank**: +5 VP for most on **East** and +5 VP for **West**.  
  - Tie: most Stones wins; if still tied, all tied players score.  
- **Yellow Favor Cards**: +3 VP each if condition met:  
  - **Master of Scribes**: ≥7 total Favor symbols (immediate + permanent).  
  - **Master of Farmers**: ≥9 Farmers.  
  - **West/East Side**: All 3 Provinces on same river side.  
  - **Nile/Frontier**: All 3 Provinces all adjacent to Nile or all not.  
  - **Upper/Lower Egypt**: All 3 Provinces in Upper or Lower Egypt.  
  - Discard after use. Only one of each type per scoring.

#### Final Scoring (End of New Kingdom Only)  
- **Gold Bonus**:  
  - +6 VP for most Gold.  
  - +4 VP for second most.  
  - +2 VP for third most.  
  - **Tie**: tied players both score the higher VP; next rank is skipped.  

**Total VP** = Intermediate (Old) + Intermediate (New) + Final Gold Bonus.  
**Winner**: Highest total VP.  
**Tiebreakers**:  
1. Most Pyramids.  
2. Most Stones.  
3. Shared victory if still tied.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I bid more than I have in Gold?** No. You may discard Favor cards for 1 Gold each during bidding.  
- **Can I pass if I’m not outbid?** Yes. If your bid is still highest, you may pass on your turn.  
- **Can I use multiple Favor cards of different types in one phase?** Yes, but never two identical ones.  
- **What if I can’t place Farmers I buy?** You cannot buy more Farmers than open Fields allow.  
- **Can I use Architect card after placing third Stone?** No. If 3 Stones are placed, they automatically become a Pyramid. Architect must be used *instead* of the third Stone.  
- **Can I play Free Farmer during Offering Phase?** No. Only during Market Phase.  
- **Do I get rewards if I play Theft card?** No, but you steal 3 Gold.  
- **Can I use Treasury and Big Harvest on same Province?** No. Treasury replaces all income; Big Harvest modifies it.  
- **Are unused Province cards used in New Kingdom?** No. Only Provinces used in Old Kingdom are reshuffled and reused.
