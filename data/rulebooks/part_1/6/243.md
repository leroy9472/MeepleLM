### 1. Lore & Objective
Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) is a tactical wargame simulating company or battalion-level ground combat during World War II across multiple theaters. The goal is to achieve scenario-specific victory conditions, such as territorial control or unit ratio superiority.

### 2. Components
- **Mapboards:** Geomorphic hex grid (40m/hex) with terrain types (Open Ground, Woods, Buildings, Roads).
- **Counters:** Represent Multi-Man Counters (MMC: squads, half-squads), Single-Man Counters (SMC: leaders, heroes), vehicles, guns, and markers.
- **Dice:** Two six-sided dice (one white, one colored) for resolution.
- **Markers:** First Fire, Final Fire, Prep Fire, Bounding Fire, DM (Desperation Morale), CX (Close Combat), TI (Task Involved), Pin, and others.
- **Reference Charts:** Infantry Fire Table (IFT), Close Combat Table (CCT), Terrain Effects Modifiers (TEM), and others.

### 3. Setup
- Players set up units according to scenario instructions.
- The Scenario Defender sets up first, followed by the Scenario Attacker.
- Concealed units ("?") and Hidden Initial Placement (HIP) units may be used.
- Bore Sighting can be recorded for MGs and guns.
- Wind, weather, and environmental conditions are determined pre-game.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each Game Turn consists of two Player Turns. Each Player Turn has eight phases:
1. **Rally Phase (RPh):** Broken units rally; Wind Change DR.
2. **Prep Fire Phase (PFPh):** Attacker fires; Opportunity Fire declared.
3. **Movement Phase (MPh):** Attacker moves; Defensive First Fire occurs.
4. **Defensive Fire Phase (DFPh):** Defender fires remaining units.
5. **Advancing Fire Phase (AFPh):** Attacker fires non-firing units at half FP.
6. **Rout Phase (RtPh):** Broken units rout or are eliminated.
7. **Advance Phase (APh):** Attacker advances into enemy hexes.
8. **Close Combat Phase (CCPh):** Resolve close combat in contested hexes.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Line of Sight (LOS):** Determined by thread between hex centers; blocked by terrain.
- **Infantry Fire:** Use IFT with FP, range, and TEM. PBF doubles FP at adjacent range.
- **Fire Groups (FG):** Adjacent units with LOS can combine fire; leader can direct.
- **Defensive Fire:**
  - **First Fire:** Full FP, -1 DRM (FFMO/FFNAM).
  - **Subsequent First Fire (SFF):** Half FP, Sustained Fire penalties, Final Fire marker.
  - **Final Protective Fire (FPF):** Half FP, adjacent only, IFT DR is also NMC for firer.
  - **Residual Fire:** Half FP left after First Fire; attacks entering units.
- **Movement:**
  - MMC: 4 MF; Leader: 6 MF; Road bonus: +1 MF.
  - Double Time: +2 MF at start, +1 if declared mid-move.
  - Bypass: Move along woods/building edges at reduced cost.
  - Dash: Cross road at full MF cost; attacked at 1/2 FP.
- **Close Combat:**
  - Simultaneous attacks using CCT.
  - Odds calculated, DR compared to Kill Number.
  - Ambush allows withdrawal before/after combat.
  - Withdrawal from Melee possible with -2 DRM.
- **Morale & Breakdown:**
  - NMC: DR ≤ Morale Level to pass.
  - Breaking: Invert unit, add DM marker.
  - Self-Rally: DR ≤ Morale with +4 DRM if DM.
  - Heat of Battle: DR=2 on MC/Rally may cause Hero, Berserk, Battle Hardening, or Surrender.
- **Concealment:** Units under "?"; affects LOS, ambush, and routing.
- **Machine Guns (MG):** Can sustain fire, lay firelanes, use SFF.
- **Leadership:** DRM to rally, MC, fire; non-cumulative.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends after specified Game Turns.
- Victory determined by scenario conditions (e.g., building control, squad ratio).
- Units in Melee at end are eliminated.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Residual Fire:** Only one per location; strength is half IFT column used.
- **Firelanes:** MG-only; FP is one column left of original, not half.
- **Cowering:** DR=doubles with no leader directing; unit marked Final Fire.
- **Snipers:** Activate when opponent rolls Sniper Activation Number (SAN) on certain DRs.
- **Prisoners:** Captured via surrender or CC; guarded by "Guard" unit.
- **No Quarter:** Declare to refuse prisoners; prevents surrender.
