## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Space Hulk is a tactical skirmish game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, pitting heavily armored Space Marines against swarming Genestealers within the claustrophobic corridors of a derelict spacecraft. The objective varies by mission, but typically involves the Space Marines completing a critical task (e.g., activating systems, sealing doors, retrieving artifacts) while surviving relentless Genestealer assaults. The Genestealer player seeks to eliminate all Space Marines or prevent mission completion.

2. Components  
- Space Marine and Genestealer miniatures  
- Blip markers (representing hidden Genestealers)  
- Command Point counters  
- Overwatch, Guard, and Jam markers  
- Door and flame markers  
- Mission-specific tokens (e.g., generators, computers, artifacts)  
- Measuring tool (for line of sight and movement)  
- Dice (D6)  

3. Setup  
- Deploy Space Marines at designated entry points per mission.  
- Genestealer blips are placed at entry points as specified by mission rules.  
- Blips are hidden and not revealed until within line of sight of a Space Marine or voluntarily converted.  
- Set mission-specific objectives (e.g., control panels, generators, doors).  
- Determine Command Points: Marine player draws a counter; Sergeant may re-roll once per turn.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows this sequence:  
1. **Marine Player Phase**:  
   - Draw Command Point counter (Sergeant may re-roll).  
   - Activate Space Marines one at a time, spending Action Points (AP) for movement, shooting, overwatch, etc.  
   - Command Points may be spent at any time for additional actions.  
2. **Genestealer Player Phase**:  
   - Reinforcements: Add blips per mission rules.  
   - Activate Genestealers and blips.  
   - Blips may be voluntarily converted or revealed when entering line of sight.  
   - Genestealers move and attack.  
3. **Mission Status Phase**:  
   - Check mission progress.  
   - Clear Overwatch, Guard, Jam, and Flame statuses.  
   - Resolve special abilities and end-of-turn effects (e.g., weapon overheating).

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Action Points (AP)**: Each Space Marine has 4 AP per turn. Actions cost AP (e.g., move 1 square = 1 AP, shoot = 1 AP).  
- **Line of Sight (LOS)**: Draw from front three squares of a model. Blocked by walls and terrain. Cannot shoot or move diagonally between obstructed squares.  
- **Overwatch**: Spend 2 AP to place a Marine on overwatch. Triggers automatic shot when a Genestealer moves within LOS and range (12 squares). Must target the triggering model.  
- **Command Points (CP)**:  
  - Spent during Marine activation or in response to witnessed Genestealer actions.  
  - Cannot be used to take an additional shot after an overwatch shot.  
  - Can be spent mid-activation (e.g., after 2 AP used, spend CP to act another Marine, then resume).  
  - Can be spent on any Marine when responding to a witnessed action.  
- **Sustained Fire**: After hitting with a ranged weapon, gain +1 to hit on the next shot at the same target. Lost if another model (except overwatching Marines) acts. Carries over between turns.  
- **Close Combat**:  
  - Frontal attacks only unless attacking from side/rear (defender survives, may turn to face).  
  - Genestealers roll 3D6, Marine rolls 1D6. Highest total wins. Winner kills loser if facing them.  
  - Special weapons modify rolls (e.g., Thunder Hammer +1, Power Sword allows parry).  
- **Blips**:  
  - Represent hidden Genestealers. Converted when revealed or voluntarily.  
  - Cannot enter LOS or move adjacent to Marines.  
  - If no space to place models upon conversion, surplus are lost.  
  - May chain reactions if blip conversion reveals another blip (allowed).  
- **Doors**:  
  - Can be opened if in front three squares and adjacent (includes around corners).  
  - Closed doors block movement and LOS. Can be destroyed in combat (6 to destroy).  
- **Jams**:  
  - Occur when rolling doubles on a shooting roll.  
  - Jammed Marine cannot shoot.  
  - Spend 1 CP to clear jam and return to overwatch if previously on overwatch.  
  - Can set Guard while jammed; clearing jam removes Guard.  
- **Ladders**:  
  - Cost 1 AP (Genestealer) or 2 AP (Marine) to climb.  
  - Marine descending rolls die: on 1, falls, crushes model below, loses remaining AP.  
  - Facing irrelevant for use; original facing maintained when climbing.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Victory is mission-specific:  
  - Marines win by completing objective (e.g., sealing doors, activating generators).  
  - Genestealers win by killing all Marines or preventing objective completion.  
- No cumulative scoring system; game ends immediately upon objective completion or annihilation.
