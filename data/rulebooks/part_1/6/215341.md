### 1. Lore & Objective
In Thunderstone Quest, you are a Champion recruiting Heroes, casting Spells, and wielding Weapons to battle Monsters in a Dungeon. Your goal is to gain Experience Points (XP), defeat Monsters, and collect Treasures. As you defeat Monsters, you may find Guardian Keys. After the fourth Guardian Key is found, the Thunderstone Guardian appears, and each player gets one final turn. Victory Points (VP) are scored from cards in your deck and XP tokens. The player with the highest VP total wins.
