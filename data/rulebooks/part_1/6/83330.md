## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
- The Keeper receives a secret Objective card during setup that defines how both the Keeper and Investigators win.  
- Investigators win by finding all Clue cards (numbered 3 to 1), which leads to the final clue (Clue 1). Once Clue 1 is found, the Objective card is revealed. The first side to meet their winning condition wins.  
- The Keeper wins if all Investigators are eliminated.  
- If neither side wins before the last Event card is resolved, all players lose.  
- Investigators may also win by escaping the board if the Objective requires it.

2. Components  
- Map tiles, room feature markers (e.g., Altar, Camp Fire, Hiding Space, Ladder, Vents)  
- Investigator components: Character cards, Trait cards, Starting Items, Spell decks, Skill point tokens  
- Keeper components: Monster figures and tokens, Mythos cards, Trauma cards, Keeper Action cards, Objective cards, Event cards, Combat decks (Humanoid, Beast, Eldritch)  
- Exploration cards: Clues, Keys, Equipment, Artefacts, Weapons, Tomes, Nothing of Interest  
- Obstacle and Lock cards  
- Puzzle pieces (Wiring, Lock, Rune, Alchemy)  
- Tokens: Damage, Horror, Stun, Fire, Darkness, Threat, Time, Sample, Curse, Barrier, Corpse  
- Dice (10-sided)

3. Setup  
- Players choose a story scenario and assign one player as the Keeper; others are Investigators.  
- Investigators:  
  a. Assemble the map per the scenario.  
  b. Read “The Story So Far” aloud.  
  c. Apply any special setup rules.  
  d. Each player selects an investigator, chooses 2 of 4 Trait cards, and takes associated Starting Items and Spells.  
  e. Place investigator figures on the starting space.  
- Keeper:  
  a. Choose story path (A/B/C) using Keeper Guide; use Story Choice markers to track.  
  b. Draw and seed Exploration, Obstacle, and Lock cards face down in rooms as instructed. Obstacle cards go above Exploration cards; Lock cards go above both.  
  c. Create Mythos deck using only cards with icons matching the story; shuffle and place face down.  
  d. Draw Keeper Action cards and place face up.  
  e. Draw the matching Objective card; read silently and keep hidden.  
  f. Draw starting Mythos and Trauma cards, and starting Threat tokens as per Keeper Guide.  
  g. Read the Prologue aloud.  
- Event deck: Stack face down with Stage I on top and Stage V on bottom.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Rounds consist of sequential Investigator turns followed by a single Keeper turn.  
- Investigators decide turn order (clockwise from Keeper if no agreement).  
- After all Investigators have taken a turn, the Keeper takes their turn.  
- The cycle repeats until a win condition is met or the last Event card is resolved.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Investigator Turn:  
  - 2 Movement Steps and 1 Action Step, in any order.  
  - Movement: Move to adjacent space (orthogonal or diagonal) separated by white line or door.  
  - Run: Use Action Step to move one additional space.  
  - Explore: Reveal face-down cards in the room. Keeper reads Obstacle/Exploration cards one at a time. Obstacles must be resolved (via item or puzzle) before proceeding.  
  - Attack: Target a monster in the same space. Keeper draws from the appropriate Combat deck until a card matching the weapon type is found. Resolve skill test on card.  
  - Drop Items: Leave Exploration or Starting Items in current room (placed on top of room’s card stack).  
  - Move Barrier: Use Action Step to place or remove a barrier on a door in the same space.  
  - Hide: Spend Movement or Action Step to enter a Hiding Space. While hidden, cannot move, attack, or cast attack spells.  
  - Evade Test: Required before moving or taking a non-attack action if a monster is in the same space. Roll Dexterity + Monster’s Awareness. Fail: take monster’s damage.  
  - Horror Test: Triggered when an investigator and monster enter the same room. Roll Willpower + Monster’s Horror Rating. Fail: take 1 horror. Only one horror test per monster per turn.  
  - Locks: Attempting to enter a locked room triggers the Lock card. Keeper reveals it; investigator must fulfill requirement (item or puzzle) to enter.  
  - Darkness: Exploring costs 1 Movement + 1 Action. -2 to all combat attribute tests.  
  - Fire: Willpower test to enter (fail = 1 horror). At end of turn, take 2 damage if in room on fire.  
  - Stun: Stunned investigator gets 1 Movement Step and -2 to all attribute tests. Stunned monsters cannot move or attack.  
  - Skill Points: May discard 1 Skill Point to add Luck value to any single attribute test (except Luck). Can also add Luck to Intellect when attempting puzzles.  

- Keeper Turn:  
  1. Investigator Trading: Investigators in same space may trade items. Each stunned investigator may discard 1 stun token.  
  2. Gain Threat: Gain 1 Threat token per Investigator.  
  3. Keeper Actions: Spend Threat to play Keeper Action cards (e.g., move monsters, spawn monsters, draw Mythos/Trauma, use special abilities).  
  4. Monster Attack: Each monster in an investigator’s space may make one attack. Keeper draws from Combat deck until a Monster Attack card is drawn.  
  5. Event: Place 1 Time token on Event deck. If count matches the time number on the back of the top card, resolve the Event.  

- Puzzles:  
  - Triggered by Obstacle or Lock cards.  
  - Setup: Place setup tile (if any), shuffle and deal puzzle pieces in grid, arrows pointing up.  
  - Puzzle Actions = Investigator’s Intellect. May spend Skill Point to add Luck to Intellect.

  - Rune Puzzle: Match image on card.  
  - Wiring Puzzle: Create continuous red/blue wire path from start to finish.
