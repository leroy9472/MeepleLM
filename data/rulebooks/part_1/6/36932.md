## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Both players control small groups of warriors in a claustrophobic underground labyrinth. The Human player controls heroic warriors, including the Redeemer and condemned fighters. The Demon player commands troglodytes and demonic entities. The win conditions vary by scenario but typically involve the Demon trying to eliminate Human warriors or achieve a dark objective, while Humans strive to complete a mission—such as retrieving items, escaping, or preventing demonic plans—before time runs out or key units fall.

2. Components  
- Warrior miniatures (Human: Redeemer, Brutes, Spadassins; Demon: Troglodytes, Demon variants)  
- Game tiles (representing tunnels, chambers, and special areas)  
- Dice (standard six-sided)  
- Destiny Board and Dice of Destiny (used by the Demon player)  
- Threat Points (TP) tokens  
- Advantage Cards (Human) and Threat Cards (Demon)  
- Event Cards  
- Tokens: Hole in the Ground, Eggs, Cakes, Gems, Damage Pins, Scepter of Command, etc.  
- Warrior stat cards (tracking Movement, Combat, Defense, Talents, Gifts, and damage)

3. Setup  
- Choose a scenario; its rules override general rules.  
- Prepare the game board per scenario instructions (predefined or random tile layout).  
- Shuffle Advantage and Event decks separately; place face down.  
- Place starting warriors and tokens as specified.  
- Demon player may begin with Threat Points on the board (e.g., on Lair tiles).  
- Equip warriors with starting Gifts and Objects as per scenario.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds. Each round consists of four phases:  
1. **Initiative (Human)**:  
   - Human player rolls one die per active warrior.  
   - Assign each die to a warrior, choosing a Line of Action: Movement (MVT), Combat (CBT), or Defense (DEF).  
   - If the chosen Line is already canceled (damaged), the warrior is **Exhausted** (MVT 0, CBT 0, DEF 3, no Talents/Objects except Scepter of Command).  
2. **Human Action Phase**:  
   - Activate warriors one at a time. Each may:  
     - Move and then Combat, or Combat and then Move (no Move-Combat-Move).  
     - Use Gifts or Advantage cards.  
   - Movement: 1 point per adjacent tile. Exploring a new tile costs 1 MVT.  
   - Combat: Roll CBT dice; each die ≥ target’s DEF is a hit.  
     - vs. Troglodytes: 1 hit = 1 kill.  
     - vs. Demons: 1 hit = 1 wound (Damage Pin).  
     - vs. Humans: 1 hit = cancel one Action Line (player’s choice).  
3. **Threat Phase (Demon)**:  
   - Demon rolls 3 Dice of Destiny, assigns them to the Board of Destiny.  
   - Red abilities: usable once per phase. Black abilities: unlimited.  
   - Draw Threat cards if Dark Destiny is claimed.  
   - Spend Threat Points (TP) to spawn warriors:  
     - Troglodyte: 1 TP  
     - Demon: 5 TP (only one on board at a time unless specified)  
   - **Spawning Rules**:  
     - Must be on a tile with at least one unexplored opening.  
     - No Human warriors on tile.  
     - Exceptions: "A Taste for Blood" or "Burrowing Monsters" on Destiny Board removes one or both restrictions.  
     - Special tiles (e.g., Lair) may allow spawning despite Human presence.  
4. **Demon Action Phase**:  
   - Activate Demon warriors one at a time.  
   - Move and/or Combat (same sequence rules as Human).  
   - Combat: Same dice mechanics; hits on Humans cancel one Action Line.  
   - Demon cannot explore new tiles.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Talents**:  
  - **Blessed**: Once per scenario, during Initiative, heal a warrior’s canceled Line and grant +1 MVT or +2 CBT until end of next Action phase.  
  - **Bodyguard**: When an allied warrior is hit, may take all or part of the damage. DEF does not apply; damage is transferred directly.  
  - **Elusive**: Can move from a tile even when outnumbered.  
  - **Frantic**: Reroll each missed combat die once.  
  - **Impressive**: Prevents enemies from leaving the tile (except via Hole in the Ground).  
    - **Elusive vs. Impressive**: If both present on a tile, both cancel out; normal movement rules apply.  
- **Exhaustion**: Occurs when a die is assigned to a canceled Line. Ends if the Line is healed before next Action phase. Bonuses to MVT/CBT allow limited action.  
- **Special Tiles**:  
  - **Booby-Trapped Tunnel**: First Human entry: Demon rolls d6:  
    1: Nothing  
    2–3: 1 hit  
    4: Ends Movement  
    5: Place Troglodyte  
    6: 2 hits  
  - **Demonic Mechanism**: First Human entry: +1 extra Die of Destiny next Threat phase.  
  - **Exit / Pentacle Room**: Holds up to 5 warriors per side.  
  - **Flooded Tunnel**: Entering or exiting ends current Movement.  
  - **Hole in the Ground**: Demon places marker on another tile. Troglodytes move between holes for 1 MVT, ignoring Blocking Rule and Impressive.  
  - **Hungry Tunnel**: Combat hits taken here are doubled (does not affect grenade damage).  
  - **Lair**: Demon can always spawn Troglodytes here, ignoring Human presence and unexplored openings.  
  - **Stash**: Scenario-specific effects.  
  - **Tight Tunnel**: Only 1 warrior per side allowed.  
- **Movement Rules**:  
  - Warriors cannot leave a tile if outnumbered (Blocking Rule), unless Elusive or using Hole in the Ground.  
  - Maximum 3 warriors per side per tile (except Exit, Pentacle Room: 5).  
  - Spawning is not movement; full MVT available after spawn.  
- **Exploration**:  
  - Only Humans can explore. Costs 1 MVT.  
  - If no unexplored openings remain after placement, replace last tile and draw until one with openings appears.  
- **Cards**:  
  - Advantage/Threat/Event cards are discarded after use.  
  - If deck runs out, no reshuffle.  
  - "Lost" card can nullify a Gift; "Critical Hit" removes Bodyguard for one round.  
- **Items & Gifts**:  
  - Items (e.g., Scepter of Command, Blunderbuss) cannot be traded or dropped.  
  - Gifts (e.g., Aura of Healing, Smite the Evil One) require matching Action Line; blocked if Line is damaged.  
  - "They are mine!" (Brother Tuc): With Initiative die 4–5, entering tile with cake-carrying demon grants +1 MVT, +1 CBT until next Initiative.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends per scenario conditions (e.g., round limit, objective completion).  
- Examples:  
  - **Save the Eggs!**: Demon wins if ≥3 eggs exit via A/B; Human wins if 0 eggs exit. Draw if 1–2. Ends round 10.  
  - **The Delight of the Angels**:  
    - Demon wins if Brother Tuc dies.  
    - After turn 4: VP counted.  
      - Demon: 1 VP per cake eaten + 1 VP per cake carried at game end.  
      - Human: 2 VP per cake extracted + 1 VP per cake eaten.  
  - **The Labyrinth**: Human wins if escapes with ≥7 gem points. Otherwise, Demon wins.  
- Multiple victory conditions exist; scenario determines primary goal.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Exhaustion & Healing**: Healing a canceled Line removes Exhausted status. Blessing only heals existing wounds, does not prevent future ones.  
- **Bodyguard**: Can take partial damage; limited by remaining wound capacity. Applies after damage conversion (e.g., Hungry Tunnel doubles after Bodyguard transfer).  
- **Spawning Limits**: Max 11 Troglodytes on board. Killed ones can respawn.  
- **Demon Removal**: Demon player cannot voluntarily remove warriors.  
- **Tile Limits**: Apply during movement and at destination.  
- **Gifts & Auras**: Aura of Courage affects any Condemned warrior (no range limit). Aura effects persist after Redeemer’s death.  
- **Grenade**: Affects all warriors (friend and foe); roll separately for each.  
- **Blunderbuss**: Can attack same tile or adjacent tile; can kill multiple troglodytes.  
- **Hole in the Ground**: Warriors spawned on Flooded tiles can move off but lose MVT upon exit.  
- **Scenarios**: Final tile placement in "Hit them Where it Hurts" and "A Breath of Fresh Air" occurs the turn *after* die reaches final number.
