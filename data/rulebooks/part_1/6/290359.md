## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Undaunted: North Africa, players command either the British Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) or the Royal Italian Army during the 1940 North African Campaign. The goal is to complete mission-specific victory conditions such as claiming objectives, escaping with certain units, or neutralizing enemy forces. Each scenario presents asymmetric challenges reflecting historical desert warfare.

2. Components  
- LRDG and Italian forces cards (42 and 40 respectively)  
- Vehicle cards (3 per side)  
- Combat counters (11 LRDG, 10 Italian)  
- Control markers (16 per side)  
- Objective markers (3)  
- Escape markers (4)  
- Damage markers (24)  
- Structure markers (6)  
- Initiative marker  
- Ten-sided dice (4)  
- Board tiles (22)  
- Fog of War cards (included in supply decks)

3. Setup  
1. Choose a scenario and place listed tiles as directed.  
2. Place objective, structure, and escape markers per scenario instructions.  
3. Each player selects a side and takes corresponding cards, combat counters, and control markers.  
4. Place tokens on starting positions as specified; ensure correct side-up orientation and seating in vehicles.  
5. Give initiative marker to side indicated by scenario.  
6. Assemble decks: Shuffle cards marked "D" into starting deck.  
7. Place supply cards ("S") face up nearby, sorted by title (open information).  
8. Place vehicle cards ("T") face up in front of respective players.  
9. Return unused cards to the box.

4. Gameplay Flow  
A round consists of three phases:  
1. Draw Cards: Both players draw 4 cards from their deck.  
2. Determine Initiative: Each player secretly chooses a card; highest initiative value wins initiative. Ties favor current holder. Chosen cards are discarded.  
3. Player Turns: The player with initiative plays first, followed by the other. On a turn:  
   - Play cards one at a time from hand into play area.  
   - Each card allows one of:  
     • Card action (perform listed action)  
     • Vehicle action (if in vehicle seat and vehicle not disabled)  
     • Switch seats (swap with another soldier in same vehicle)  
     • Hunker down (return card to supply)  
   - Before or after resolving card effect, optionally enter, exit, or reposition in a vehicle.  
   - Turn ends when no cards remain to play. All played and unplayed cards go to discard pile.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Movement Actions:  
  • Move X: Move soldier up to X scouted/controlled tiles.  
  • Drive X: Move vehicle up to X scouted/controlled tiles.  
  • Scout X: Move up to X tiles; place control marker (scouted side) on uncontrolled tiles and take a Fog of War card per new marker.  
  • Stalk X: Move up to X tiles regardless of scouting/control.

- Support Actions:  
  • Bolster X A: Take up to X cards from supply (matching squad if specified) into discard pile.  
  • Command X: Draw up to X cards into hand.  
  • Conceal: Take a Fog of War card from opponent’s supply and place in their discard pile.  
  • Control: Flip your control marker on current tile to controlled side; flip opponent’s marker back to scouted if present. Cannot control if enemy occupies and already controls tile.  
  • Inspire X A: Return up to X cards (matching squad if specified) from play area to hand.  
  • Navigate X: Choose up to X contiguous tiles (one adjacent to acting unit); place control markers on uncontrolled tiles and take Fog of War cards accordingly.  
  • Recon: Remove a Fog of War card from your hand; draw a card.  
  • Repair: Remove one damage marker from a vehicle on same tile. If damage drops below critical threshold, ready disabled vehicle.  
  • Surveil X: Choose up to X tiles; place control markers on uncontrolled tiles and take Fog of War cards.

- Combat Actions (Attack X, Strafe X, Demolition X, Antitank X, Suppress X):  
  1. Choose Target:  
     • Attack/Strafe/Suppress: Target any enemy with regular defense (not Medium Tank).  
     • Antitank: Target any vehicle.  
     • Demolition: Target vehicle or structure on same tile.  
  2. Determine Total Defense Value:  
     = Base defense + Tile cover bonus (0 for Demolition) + Range in tiles (0 for Strafe).  
     • Hills (3/1 cover): Cover is 1 if attacker is on hill or action is Strafe; else 3.  
  3. Roll Attack Dice:  
     Roll X dice (X = action value). Success if any die shows ≥ total defense or shows 0.  
  4. Determine Results:  
     • Soldier: Remove one matching card (hand → discard → deck → supply). If Suppress, flip counter to suppressed.  
     • Vehicle: One crew member suffers injury; add damage marker. If damage ≥ critical threshold → disabled. If ≥ integrity → destroyed (crew moved to tile, vehicle removed). If Suppress, suppress one crew member.  
     • Structure: Remove and claim for objective points.

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when a player meets their victory condition:  
- Claim Objectives: Control objective tiles and/or destroy structures to meet required objective points. LRDG scores by destroying structures; Italians by controlling them.  
- Escape: Move specified combat counters off the board via escape markers. Associated cards are removed from the game.  
- Neutralise Enemies: Remove specified enemy combat counters from the board via injuries/damage.  
- Beyond All Hope: If a player cannot win:  
  • Opponent wins immediately if their goal is neutralization.  
  • If claiming objectives, compare points. Leader wins; if tied, initiative holder wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Fog of War Cards: Cannot be played for actions. Can be used for initiative. Removed via Recon.  
- Suppressed Units: Cannot act. Playing their card readies them (no action taken). Can hunker down while suppressed.  
- Disabled Vehicles: Cannot perform vehicle actions. Can be repaired.  
- Hunker Down: Returns card to supply; removed from deck until bolstered. Cannot hunker down with Fog of War cards.  
- Entering Vehicles: Soldier must be on same tile. Cannot enter enemy-occupied vehicle. Transfers vehicle card ownership if switching control.  
- Vehicle Actions: Only available if vehicle is ready. Acting unit counts as being on vehicle’s tile.  
- Initiative Ties: Current holder keeps initiative marker.  
- Deck Empty: Shuffle discard pile to form new deck when drawing cards. Do not shuffle play area.
