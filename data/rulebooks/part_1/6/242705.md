### 1. Lore & Objective
Aeon Trespass: Odyssey is a narrative-driven, cooperative board game where players take on the roles of Argonauts piloting giant Titans to battle world-ending Primordials. The ultimate goal is to progress through the story cycle, defeat Primordials, manage resources, and survive long enough to reach the end of the current story arc. Victory is achieved by slaying Primordials in battle and advancing the story, while defeat occurs if all Titans are destroyed, Argo FATE exceeds 9, or campaign-specific loss conditions are met.

1. **Movement Step**: Move Argo to adjacent map tile.
2. **Timeline Step**: Advance timeline marker.
3. **Exploration Step**: Resolve map symbols, draw Exploration cards, move/spawn Adversary.
4. **Expedition Step**: Resolve Hub or R&R adventures if on unexplored tile.
5. **Encounter Step**: Resolve Timeline Battles or Battle Events.
6. **Advancement Step**: Research technologies, craft gear, breed Titans.
7. **Story Step**: Resolve story progression, Mnemos breakthroughs.
8. **Doom Step**: Resolve Doom progression if threshold met.
9. **End Step**: Mark unexplored tile as explored.

**Battle Phase:**

- **Titan Round**: Each Titan takes a turn with one Movement and one Combat Action.
- Combat Action: Declare attack, raise Rage, roll attack, draw BP card, power roll, resolve responses, escalate, clear Kratos Pool, second ability window.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Rage (Ω)**: Increases by 1 when attacking; used for Kratos abilities and affects Priority Target.
- **Fate (Ψ)**: Used to re-roll dice; exceeding 9 triggers Moiros card draw.
- **Danger (A)**: Damage taken; exceeding 9 triggers Trauma/Obol draw.
- **Kratos Pool**: Holds Break, Opening, and Diversion tokens used during attacks.
- **Escalation**: When a BP card is wounded, replace it with a higher-level card in the deck; same for AI deck.
- **Chain Break**: Ends the current attack sequence immediately, often triggered by Bonus Attacks or Trauma cards.
- **Bonus Attack**: Immediate attack, may cause Chain Break; can use exhausted weapons (unexhaust first).
- **Primordial Traits**: Blindspots, Weakspots, Lumbering, Vantage Points affect targeting and combat.
- **Terrain**: Affects movement, line of sight, and triggers special effects (e.g., Chasm kills, Ambrosia grants tokens).
- **Keywords**: Special abilities like Rush, Pull, Pushback, Knockback, Displace, with detailed movement and combat interactions.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

- Retreat counts as defeat but saves remaining Titans.

**Campaign Victory:**

**Campaign Defeat:**

- Losing all CREW or HULL.
- Argo FATE exceeding 9.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Displacement**: A Titan cannot be displaced to an occupied space; if no legal space exists, the Titan dies.
- **Knockback/Pull into Obstacles**: Destructible obstacles are destroyed; Indestructible obstacles cause Crash and movement along edge.
- **Chain Break Timing**: During a Titan attack, resolve "Clear Kratos Pool" and "Second Ability Window" before the Chain Break effect.
- **Bonus Attack with Exhausted Weapon**: Yes; unexhaust it before the attack.
- **Retreat**: Possible only if battle conditions allow (usually after 2 Titan deaths); occurs at the beginning of any Titan Round.
- **Vantage Points**: Only one Titan per VP; falling off triggers displacement; adjacency rules apply.
- **Ambrosia Limit**: Exceeding the limit (usually 4) causes immediate death.
- **Inward Odyssey**: Triggered by gaining Argo Knowledge; resolved at end of current step, except when gained from 2 Progress tokens (resolved at end of Story Step).
