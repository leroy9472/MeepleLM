## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Dawn of the Zeds is a cooperative or versus survival game where players defend the town of Farmingdale from an encroaching zombie horde. The primary objective is to prevent any Zeds unit from entering Town Center before the final Event card is resolved. Victory is achieved by surviving until the end of the Event deck. In cooperative play, players control Hero and Civilians units; in the Versus game, one player controls the Zeds and Un-Zeds forces.

4. Eat Phase (Levels I-V)

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Action Economy:**
- Player receives Event Actions (from Event card), Player Actions (1 per player), and Character Actions (from Hero cards)
- Actions can be spent on Move, Forage, Gunfire Attack, Heal, Build, Research, or special abilities
- Actions are reset during Housekeeping Phase

**Movement:**
- Heroes: 4 spaces per Move Action
- Heroic Civilians: 3 spaces
- Regular Civilians: 2 spaces
- Stacking: 2 Player units per space (unlimited in Town Center and Catacombs)
- Cannot enter Start spaces

**Combat:**
- Hand-to-Hand: Triggered when units occupy same space
- Gunfire: Range 1 (adjacent spaces), some units have Long-Range capability
- Combat Procedure:
  1. Determine Initial Column based on Strength comparison
  2. Apply Column Shifts (abilities, terrain, markers)
  3. Roll 2 dice, cross-reference with Combat Table
  4. Apply Hits
  5. Apply Retreats (losing side retreats)
- Terrain Shifts: Named spaces and Town spaces provide +1 terrain shift for defenders
- Zeds Mobs: Multiple Zeds in a space combine Strength

**Resource Management:**
- Supplies: Consumed during Eat Phase, gained through Forage
- Ammo: Required for Gunfire attacks, gained through Forage
- Infection: Tracked for Outbreak risk, increased by Hand-to-Hand combat and Saving Rolls, decreased by Heal Actions

**Special Phases:**
- 4R Phase (Levels II-V): Free movement for Raiders (toward Town Center), Rangers (player choice), Refugees (toward Town Center), Rescuers (National Guard, player choice)
- Infection Phase: Check for Outbreak based on Infection Level
- Eat Phase: Consume Supplies based on Event card, apply Hits for shortage

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Victory Conditions:**
- Cooperative: Survive until the last Event card is resolved
- Versus: Hero players win by surviving until last card; Zeds player wins if any Zeds unit enters Town Center or Chaos markers are exhausted (Levels II-V)

**Defeat Conditions:**
- Any Zeds unit enters Town Center (before combat)
- No Chaos markers available when one must be placed (Levels II-V)
- In Versus game, Zeds player wins immediately when Zeds enter Town Center

**Scoring:**
1. Count "Good" elements:
   - All Player units on map (Heroes, Civilians, National Guard)
   - Supplies and Ammo markers if ≥2 remaining
   - Antidote and Super Weapon components in play
   - Infection marker if level ≤6
   - +3 points for each Villager and Refugee unit
2. Count "Bad" elements:
   - Chaos markers on map
   - +1 point per unrevealed Event card (if game lost)
3. Final Score = Good count - Bad count
4. Score determines epilogue quality (0-20+ range with corresponding narrative outcomes)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Ties:** Player(s) choose when tied (except in Versus game with Dr. Marteuse present, where Zeds player chooses)
- **Saving Rolls:** Outside Hospital: 4-6 to survive, 1-3 to Cemetery. In Hospital: automatic elimination on last Hit
- **Chaos Spaces:** Player units must stop when entering, cannot act except to defend and retreat. Removed during Housekeeping Phase if occupied by non-Zeds unit
- **Catacombs (Tunnel track):** Unlimited stacking, units must roll to exit (1-3: move, 4-5: stay, 6: Lost! roll)
- **Lost! Procedure:** Roll again, place unit on that space of Tunnel track. If same space, eliminated without Saving Roll
- **Un-Zeds Units (Versus):** Human units controlled by Zeds player, can be Arrested by Player units, have Saving Rolls (1-3: Start space, 4-6: Cemetery)
- **Super Zeds:** Never form Mobs, removed from play when eliminated (not returned to cup)
- **Defiant Civilians:** Immobilized until Zeds enter their Village space, then released
