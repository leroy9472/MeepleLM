## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Horizons of Spirit Island*, players take on the roles of powerful nature spirits defending their island home from invading colonizers. The Dahan—indigenous people of the island—aid the spirits in resistance. The game is cooperative: players win or lose together.

**Victory Condition:**  
Victory is determined by the current terror level. At **Terror Level 1**, players must completely clear the island of all invaders (explorers, towns, and cities). When a fear card reveals a new terror level, it replaces the previous one with an easier win condition.

**Loss Conditions:**  
- **Too Much Blight:** No blight remains in the blight pool.  
- **Spirit Destroyed:** Any spirit has no presence discs left on the board.  
- **Time Runs Out:** The invader deck is empty when a card needs to be drawn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Spirit Phase  
Choose **one** growth option and perform its actions (in any order):

- **Add a Presence:** Place one presence disc from your panel onto the board within range of existing presence. You may instead move an existing presence. A **sacred site** exists in any land with 2+ of your presence.  
- **Gain Energy:** Gain energy equal to the highest uncovered number on your energy track.  
- **Gain a Power Card:** Draw 4 from Minor or Major deck, choose 1, discard the rest. If Major, **forget** one power card (discard it; if unique, remove from game).  
- **Reclaim Cards:** Return all cards from your personal discard pile to your hand.  

Then:  
- Play up to **highest uncovered number** on card play track.  
- Pay energy costs (top-left of cards) using energy gained this turn or saved.  

#### Fast Power Phase  
Use **fast** (red bird) power cards and innate powers.  

- **Range & Targeting:** Powers have range from your presence; some require sacred sites or terrain types.  
- **Elements:** Total elements from played cards (fast + slow) must meet thresholds to activate innate or card powers. You may choose to use fewer elements to avoid triggering effects.  
- **Gather:** Move specified units *from adjacent lands* into the target land.  
- **Push:** Move specified units *from target land* to adjacent lands (can split units).  
- Innate powers cost no energy and don’t count toward card play limit.  

#### Invader Phase  

**Fear Generation:**  
- Fear is generated by:  
  - Playing powers with **fear symbol**  
  - Destroying towns (1 fear) or cities (2 fear)  
- When all fear markers are moved to generated fear area, earn 1 **fear card**.  
- Move fear markers back to pool; continue with any excess fear.  

**Reveal Fear Cards:**  
- Reveal each earned fear card.  
- Perform effect for **current terror level**.  
- If terror level card is revealed, place it on terror level space (easier win condition).  
- Discard fear cards to fear discard pile.  

**Ravage (matching land types):**  
- Explorers: 1 damage  
- Towns: 2 damage  
- Cities: 3 damage  
- Damage applies to **land** and **Dahan** simultaneously.  

**Blight & Presence Destruction:**  
- If **2+ net damage** is dealt (after defend effects):  
  - Add 1 blight to the land.  
  - Each spirit loses 1 presence in that land (destroyed, not returned to panel).  
- If land already has blight, **cascade**: add another blight to an adjacent land.  

**Dahan Damage & Fightback:**  
- Every **2 damage** destroys 1 Dahan.  
  - 1 damage flips Dahan to damaged side; 2 damage destroys.  
- Surviving Dahan fight back: each deals **2 damage** to invaders (you choose allocation).  
  - Explorers: 1 HP  
  - Towns: 2 HP  
  - Cities: 3 HP (flip when damaged; place energy marker at 2 damage)  
- Dahan **do not fight back** if ravage is skipped in a land.  

**Build (matching land types):**  
- Only in lands with invaders.  
- If **more towns than cities** → add a city  
- Otherwise → add a town  

**Explore:**  
- Reveal top invader card.  
- Add 1 explorer to each land that:  
  - Contains a town or city  
  - Is adjacent to a land with a town or city  
  - Is coastal (adjacent to ocean)  

**Advance Invader Cards:**  
- Ravage card → discard  
- Build card → Ravage space  
- Explore card → Build space  

#### Slow Power Phase  
Use **slow** (blue turtle) power cards and innate powers.  
All rules from Fast Power Phase apply (range, elements, push/gather, etc.).

#### Time Passes  
- Discard all played power cards to personal discard pile.  
- Heal all damaged Dahan and damaged invader pieces (flip back).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

- **Order of Ravage:** You choose the order in which matching lands ravage.  
- **Cascading Blight:** Whenever blight is added to an already blighted land, add another blight to an adjacent land. Applies even if blight was added by a player power.  
- **Presence Loss from Blight:** Whenever blight is added (by any source), each spirit with presence in that land loses 1 presence.  
- **Element Thresholds:** You may act as if you have fewer elements than available to avoid triggering effects.  
- **Power Card Skipping:** You may play a card for its elements only, skipping its text.  
- **Innate Powers:** Free to use; no energy or card play cost.  
- **Multiple Thresholds:** Resolve top-to-bottom if all are met.  
- **Adjacent Lands:** Includes lands on different island boards.  
- **Replacing Invaders:** Towns/cities replaced (not destroyed) do **not** generate fear.  
- **Damaged Invaders:** When replaced/downgraded, retain damage.  
- **Growth Actions:** Can be performed in any order.  
- **Fast Powers:** Cannot be delayed to Slow Power Phase.  
- **Power Resolution:** Do as much as possible. If part is impossible, skip it (e.g., "Push 3 Dahan" in land with 2 → push both).
