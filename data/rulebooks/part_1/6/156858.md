# Black Orchestra — Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Players take on the roles of German conspirators attempting to assassinate Adolf Hitler during World War II. The game is a cooperative thriller where players must gather resources, avoid detection, and execute a plot at the right moment to eliminate Hitler and win.

**Objective:** Successfully assassinate Hitler by attempting a plot and rolling enough bullseyes (⑥) to meet or exceed Hitler’s Military Support level while rolling fewer eagles (①) than allowed by the acting conspirator’s Suspicion level.

The players lose if:
- All conspirators are arrested.
- The "Documents Located" event card is drawn.
- An event card cannot be drawn when required.

## 2. Components
- Game board depicting locations in Germany and occupied Europe
- 1 Hitler pawn and 5 Deputy tiles (Hess, Goebbels, Bormann, Himmler, Göring)
- 9 Conspirator sheets with unique abilities
- 5 pawns (one per player, or two in solo)
- 10 dice
- 24 item tiles (3 copies of 8 items)
- 51 Conspirator cards:
  - 24 standard cards
  - 15 illegal (restricted) cards
  - 12 plot cards
- 84 Event cards (12 per stage, stages 1–7)
  - Includes standard, important (yellow top), and key events
- 24 Interrogation cards
- 3 Difficulty tiles (Easy, Standard, Hard)
- 11 tracking cubes (for motivation, suspicion, military support)
- 1 red Hitler’s Military Support cube
- Reference sheet, Victory card

## 3. Setup
1. **Place Leaders:** Put Hitler and the five Deputy tiles on their starting spaces as marked on the board.
2. **Item Tiles:** Shuffle the 24 item tiles and place one face-down on each black square space.
3. **Difficulty Level:** Choose Easy (2), Standard (3), or Hard (4). Place the red Military Support cube at the chosen value. Place the matching difficulty tile over the track.
4. **Event Decks:** Sort event cards by stage (1–7). Shuffle each stage deck separately. Remove and discard the top 2 cards from each deck without looking. Place decks above their respective stage spaces on the board.
5. **Decks:** Shuffle the Conspirator deck and Interrogation deck. Place them near the board.
6. **Player Setup:** Each player chooses or is randomly dealt one Conspirator sheet (two in solo). Take matching pawn and two colored cubes. Place one cube on Timid (Motivation) and Medium (Suspicion) tracks.
7. **Starting Position:** All pawns begin at the Train Station in Berlin.
8. **Dice:** Place 10 dice near the board.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn, follow this sequence:

### 1. Check for Hitler and Deputy Penalties
If your pawn starts your turn in the same space as Hitler or a Deputy, apply the penalty:
- **Hitler:** Decrease Motivation by 1.
- **Hess:** Discard one card from your dossier.
- **Goebbels:** Cannot use your special ability this turn.
- **Bormann:** Cannot take the CONSPIRE action this turn.
- **Himmler:** Raise Suspicion by 1.
- **Göring:** Discard one item.

You may suffer multiple penalties. Apply them in any order.

### 2. Take up to 3 Actions
You may take any combination of up to 3 actions. Most actions can be repeated, except CONSPIRE, which can only be taken once per turn.

Available actions:
- **ACT:** Resolve one effect on your Conspirator sheet or in your dossier marked with →. This costs 1 action.
- **COLLECT ITEM:** Take a revealed item tile from your space and add it to your sheet, respecting item limits.
- **CONSPIRE (once per turn):** Spend 1 action per die (up to 3 dice). Roll all chosen dice and resolve in order:
  1. For each ①, you and all other conspirators in your space raise Suspicion by 1.
  2. For each ⑥, place that die on the Dissent Track.
  3. Total number results (1, 2, 3): gain that many additional actions this turn.
- **DELIVER ITEM:** Discard an item to gain benefits listed on a space (only if the original item has been removed). Benefits marked "distributed" may be shared among players.
- **DOSSIER:** Draw 1 card from the Conspirator deck into your dossier, face-up. Observe card limits.
- **MOVE:** Move to any adjacent space connected by a white dotted line. All Berlin spaces are adjacent to each other. To enter/leave Berlin, you must use the Train Station.
  - You may only move to spaces with a stage number ≤ current stage.
  - When entering a space with modifiers (e.g., Paris: -3 Suspicion, +1 Military Support), apply them immediately.
  - You may re-enter a space multiple times in a turn to reapply effects.
- **RELEASE:** If at High or lower Suspicion and in GESTAPO HQ, roll 1 die:
  - On ①: you are arrested.
  - On any other result: raise your Suspicion by 1 and release one arrested conspirator. The released conspirator moves to GESTAPO HQ at High Suspicion.
- **REVEAL ITEM:** Flip a face-down item tile in your space face-up.
- **TRANSFER:** Give or take 1 card or item from a conspirator in the same space, respecting limits.

### 3. Draw an Event Card
Draw the top card from the leftmost available event deck (lowest stage number). Place it in the Current Event space and resolve its effects immediately, top to bottom.

- A new stage begins when the first card of that stage is resolved.
- If a Key Event is drawn, place it in Current Event. When the next card is drawn, move the Key Event to the Key Event space on the board.
- If a Key Event is active and an Important Event (yellow top) is drawn, discard it without effect and draw a replacement.
- Key Events are discarded when a new stage begins.

If no event card can be drawn, the players lose.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Motivation
Tracked on each conspirator sheet. Levels (from lowest to highest): Timid, Skeptical, Motivated, Committed, Reckless.

Benefits (cumulative):
- Skeptical: Increased dossier size.
- Motivated: May use special ability.
- Committed: May attempt plots.
- Reckless: May attempt certain dangerous plots.

### Suspicion
Tracked on each conspirator sheet. Levels: Low, Medium, High, Extreme.

- Higher suspicion increases risk of plot detection.
- At Extreme Suspicion, a Gestapo Raid results in arrest.
- The number of ① rolled that causes automatic plot failure is shown under each level (e.g., Medium: 2 or more ① = failure).

### Dossier & Item Limits
- **Dossier (Card) Limit:**
  - 1–2 players: 6 cards (but 2 if at Timid Motivation)
  - 3–4 players: 5 cards
  - 5 players: 4 cards
- **Item Limit:**
  - 1–2 players: 4 items
  - 3–4–5 players: 3 items

If limits are exceeded, discard down immediately.

### Gestapo Raids
When a Gestapo Raid card is drawn:
1. All conspirators at Extreme Suspicion are arrested.
2. Each conspirator must, for each illegal card in their dossier:
   - Discard it, OR
   - Keep it and raise Suspicion by 1.
   Resolve one card at a time, in any order. If Suspicion reaches Extreme, keep remaining illegal cards.
3. Remove all dice from the Dissent Track.

If all conspirators are arrested, the players lose.

### Arrest and Prison
When arrested:
- Move to the PRISON space.
- Discard all illegal cards.
- PRISON is not adjacent to any space; only entry/exit is via arrest/release.

**While in Prison:**
- Cannot take actions or resolve → effects.
- Cannot be targeted by effects (unless the effect specifically releases you).
- Special ability is inactive.
- Retain all items and non-illegal cards.

**Arrested Player’s Turn:**
1. Draw an Interrogation card.
2. Draw an Event card.

**Interrogation Cards:**
- Secretly read the card. Choose one option to resolve.
- You must be able to fully resolve all effects of the chosen option.
- You may always choose "Try and Resist."
- After resolving, shuffle the card back (unless stated otherwise).
- Do not reveal other options.

**Releasing from Prison:**
- Via Interrogation card: Released conspirator sets Suspicion to High.
- Via RELEASE action: Released conspirator sets Suspicion to Extreme.

### Dissent Track
- Dice showing ⑥ from CONSPIRE actions are placed here.
- When 3 dice are on the track, the active player chooses:
  - Increase one conspirator’s Motivation by 1, OR
  - Decrease Hitler’s Military Support by 1 (cannot go below starting level).
- Return all dice to supply. Add any overflow ⑥ from current roll.

### Plot Attempts
To attempt a plot:
1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Meet all required elements on the plot card (location, Hitler proximity, etc.).
   - Be at Committed or Reckless Motivation (some plots require Reckless).
2. **Use ACT Action:** Resolve the → "Attempt one plot in your dossier" on your Conspirator sheet.
3. **Build Dice Pool:**
   - Start with 1 die for meeting required elements.
   - Add dice via optional elements:
     - **Items:** Discard listed items (your own or from allies in same space).
     - **Affiliation:** Match plot’s affiliation (Abwehr, Civilian, Wehrmacht).
     - **Meeting:** Other conspirators in space (as specified).
   - Conspirator cards/abilities may add dice.
4. **Determine Difficulty:**
   - Note Hitler’s Military Support (target ⑥ count).
   - Note your Suspicion level (maximum ① allowed).
   - Announce required ⑥ and allowed ①.
   - You may remove dice from the pool.
5. **Roll All Dice:**
   - If ① rolled ≥ allowed by your Suspicion: **Plot Fails and is Detected.**
     - Ignore other results.
     - Discard plot card.
     - Move Hitler to CHANCELLERY.
     - All conspirators lose 1 Motivation.
     - Attempting conspirator is arrested.
   - If ① rolled < allowed:
     - Count ⑥.
     - If ⑥ < Military Support: **Plot Fails but Not Detected.** Continue turn; do not discard plot.
     - If ⑥ ≥ Military Support: **Plot Succeeds. You win the game.**

## 6. Scoring & End Game
There is no scoring. The game ends immediately when:
- **Win:** A plot succeeds (⑥ ≥ Military Support and ① < allowed by Suspicion).
- **Lose:**
  - All conspirators are arrested.
  - "Documents Located" event card is drawn.
  - Cannot draw an event card when required.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Plot Cards:** Not illegal. Not discarded during arrest unless chosen. May be shared.
- **Conspire Action:** Only once per turn. Dice results resolved in order: ①, then ⑥, then numbers.
- **Hitler/Deputy Movement:** When moved, must end in a different space than start. Conspirators in same space are ignored for "nearest" determination.
- **Hand/Item Limits:** Must be observed at all times. Excess must be discarded immediately.
- **Key Events:** Active only until the first card of the next stage is resolved. Then discarded.
- **Berlin:** All B-marked spaces are stage 1 and connected. Not the same space for transfers/plot conditions.
- **"Any" Effects:** Choose one valid target.
- **Von Tresckow & Goebbels:** If Von Tresckow (extra item) is penalized by Goebbels, he loses access to special ability and must drop the extra item if over limit.
- **Deliver Item:** Only possible after original item is removed (delivery text visible).
- **Play a Card:** Always costs an action unless the card says otherwise.
