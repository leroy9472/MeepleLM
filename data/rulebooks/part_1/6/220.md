### 2. Components  
- **16 Status Cards:**
  - **10 Luxury Cards:** Numbered 1 to 10. Each awards status equal to its face value.
  - **3 Prestige Cards:** Each doubles the owner’s total status. Having two multiplies status by 4; having three multiplies by 8.
  - **3 Disgrace Cards:**
    - **Faux Pas (Thief):** Forces player to discard one luxury card (1–10). If none held, must discard the next luxury card acquired.
    - **Passé:** Reduces status by 5 (minimum 0).
    - **Scandale:** Halves the player’s final status total (round down).
- **5 Sets of 11 Money Cards:** Each set is a different color. Values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25.

### 3. Setup  
1. Give each player one complete set of 11 money cards in a single color. Players keep these hidden in hand.
2. Shuffle the 16 status cards and place them face-down as a deck in the center.
3. The player who shuffled the deck begins as the starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this sequence:

#### Auction Round  
1. **Reveal Status Card:** Flip the top card of the status deck.
   - If it is the **fourth green-edged card** (3 prestige + Scandale), the game ends immediately—no auction.
2. **Bidding Phase:** Starting with the current starting player, proceed clockwise. Each player may:
   - **Bid:** Play one or more money cards face-up, announcing the total. Must exceed the previous bid.
   - **Pass:** Take back all face-up money cards and exit the round.
3. **Determine Winner:**
   - For **Luxury or Prestige Cards:** Bidding continues until all but one player has passed. The last remaining player wins the card.
   - For **Disgrace Cards:** The **first player to pass** takes the card and keeps their bid. All other players discard their bids.
4. **Resolve Auction:**
   - Winner takes the status card and places it face-up in front of them.
   - All money cards played during the auction are discarded (removed from the game).
   - The winner becomes the starting player for the next round.
5. Repeat until the game ends.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Bidding Rules  
- Players must bid higher than the current highest bid to stay in.
- To increase a bid, **add** new money cards—no "making change" (cannot remove previously played cards).
- Players may not re-enter after passing.

#### Disgrace Card Auctions  
- Players bid to **avoid** taking the card.
- The **first player to pass** takes the disgrace card.
- That player retrieves their bid; all others lose their bids (discarded).
- The passing player starts the next round.

#### Disgrace Card Effects  
- **Faux Pas:** Immediately discard one luxury card (1–10) of your choice. If you have none, you must discard the next luxury card you acquire. Then remove the Faux Pas card from the game.
- **Passé:** Subtract 5 from final status (minimum 0).
- **Scandale:** Halve final status total (round down).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End Trigger  
- The game ends **immediately** when the **fourth green-edged card** is revealed (3 prestige cards + Scandale). No auction occurs for this card.

#### Cast Out (Elimination)  
- All players reveal their remaining money cards and sum their values.
- The player(s) with the **least total money** are **cast out** and **cannot win**, even if they have the highest status.

#### Scoring  
1. **Luxury Cards:** Add face values (1–10).
2. **Passé:** Subtract 5 from total (minimum 0).
3. **Apply Multipliers:**
   - Each **Prestige Card** doubles total status.
   - 1 prestige: ×2  
   - 2 prestige: ×4  
   - 3 prestige: ×8  
4. **Scandale:** Halve final total (after multipliers, round down).

#### Tiebreakers

1. The tied player with **more remaining money** wins.
2. If still tied, the tied player with the **highest single luxury card (1–10)** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you bid zero?** No—bidding requires playing at least one money card.
- **What if everyone passes without bidding?** The last player eligible to bid (i.e., the one who hasn’t passed yet) wins the card for free.
- **Are status cards public?** Yes—all collected status cards are face-up and visible.
- **Are money cards public?** No—only played money cards are visible during bidding; remaining hands are secret.
- **Can you take a disgrace card voluntarily by passing first?** Yes—this is often strategic.
- **Does Scandale apply before or after other effects?** Last: after all additions, subtractions, and multipliers.
- **Can Passé reduce status below zero?** No—status cannot go below 0.
- **If you take Faux Pas with no luxury cards, when do you discard?** As soon as you win your first luxury card, discard it immediately and remove Faux Pas from game.
