### 3. Setup  
1. **Board Setup:**  
   - Place the board in the center.  
   - Shuffle and place both the Trading Lands and Lands of Influence decks face down. Reveal 3 cards from each deck to form two rows of 3 face-up Destination cards.  

2. **Viking Deck Preparation:**  
   - For 4 players: use all 50 Viking cards.  
   - For 3 players: remove Viking cards marked "4" in the lower-left corner.  
   - For 2 players: remove Viking cards marked "3" or "4".  
   - Shuffle remaining Viking cards, place face down, and reveal 5 cards face-up below the board (the Viking Market).  

3. **Player Setup:**  
   - Each player chooses a ship color and takes:  
     - 1 Ship Sheet (choose normal or advanced side)  
     - 3 Silver Bracelets and 3 Recruits (place 1 of each on the ship)  
     - 2 Viking cards of different colors from the deck → place in Crew Zone (in front of player)  
     - 3 Viking cards drawn to hand  
   - Place Scoring Token (round) at 0 on Score Track.  
   - Place Reputation Token (square) at 0 on Reputation Track.  

4. **First Player:**  
   - One player draws a Destiny Token at random; the player matching that color becomes the first player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On a turn, perform these steps in order:

#### 1. Reputation Phase  
Move your Scoring Token forward on the Score Track by a number of spaces equal to the **highest value your Reputation Token has reached** (i.e., current position on Reputation Track).

#### 2. Action Phase  
Choose **one** of the following actions:

**A. Recruit**  
- Play one Viking card from your hand to your Crew Zone.  
- Must place it in the column matching its color. If no card of that color is present, start a new column.  
- Take **all assets** shown at the top of **every card in that column**, including the newly played one. (Excess assets beyond max capacity are lost.)  
- Then, take **one Viking card** from the Viking Market:  
  - Must match the color just played, **OR**  
  - Spend **1 Recruit** to take any color instead.  
- Replace the vacated market spot with a new card from the deck.

**B. Explore**  
- Choose one face-up Destination Card (Trading Land or Land of Influence).  
- Pay the cost shown in the **top-left corner** by discarding Vikings from your Crew Zone.  
  - Symbols like ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ mean "any 4 cards of the same color."  
  - You may spend **1 Recruit** to substitute for any 1 required Viking.  
- Take the Destination Card and place it **above your ship** (your personal tableau).  
- Gain the assets shown in the **top-right corner** of the card.  
- Replace the vacated spot with a new card from the appropriate deck.

#### 3. Trading (Optional, Once per Turn)  
- May be done **before or after** your action.  
- Spend **1, 2, or 3 Silver Bracelets** (remove from ship):  
  - 1 Bracelet → collect assets from **1st column** of all your Destination Cards and Ship  
  - 2 Bracelets → collect from **1st and 2nd columns**  
  - 3 Bracelets → collect from **all 3 columns**  
- Assets are taken from the top of each card and the ship sheet.  
- Cannot trade more than once per turn.

#### End of Turn  
- Next player takes their turn.  
- If the Viking deck is empty when a card needs to be drawn:  
  - Shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.  
  - If both deck and discard are empty, **each player with the largest Crew Zone (most Vikings in front)** must discard **one** Viking card of their choice.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Crew Zone:** Organized into 5 color columns. Only top card’s asset row is active for that column.  
- **Asset Limits:** Max 3 Recruits and 3 Bracelets on ship. Excess gained are lost.  
- **Recruits:** Used to:  
  - Take any color Viking during Recruit action  
  - Substitute for any Viking in Explore cost  
- **Bracelets:** Used only for Trading; spent to activate columns on Destination Cards.  
- **Reputation:** Drives VP gain each turn. Only the highest value ever reached counts (i.e., current track position).  
- **Destination Cards:** Provide one-time assets when explored and ongoing trade assets.  
- **Artifacts (Variant):** One randomly revealed at setup. Grants ongoing ability when conditions are met (after action).  
  - Examples:  
    - **Amulet:** Complete 5-color line → gain 1 Bracelet, 1 Recruit, +1 Reputation  
    - **Golden Bracelet:** When 3rd Viking of same color is played → reserve a Destination Card (up to 2 reserved)  
    - **Cauldron:** When 2nd Viking of same color is played → take any Viking from market  
    - **Weathervane:** Complete 5-color line → take immediate Explore action (must pay cost)  
    - **Helmet:** Place Land of Influence on Trading Land → take immediate Recruit action  
    - **Mead Cup:** When taking Explore → discard a Viking from market, replace from deck  
    - **Silver Coin:** Each Viking beyond the 3rd of a color → gain 1 VP

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End Trigger:** When any player reaches **40 or more Victory Points** on the Score Track.  
- **Finish the Round:** All players get the same number of turns. The last turn is the one before the first player in the current round.  
- **Final Scoring:** Player with the most VPs wins.  
- **Tiebreaker:**  
  1. Most **Recruits and Silver Bracelets combined** (total tokens on ship)  
  2. If still tied, shared victory (not specified further)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a Viking card if I already have 3 of that color?**  
  Yes. But if playing a 4th or more, only the top 3 cards’ assets are visible (bottom ones obscured).  
- **Can I Trade without spending any bracelets?**  
  No. Trading requires spending at least 1 bracelet.  
- **Can I Trade twice in one turn?**  
  No. Trading is limited to once per turn.  
- **What happens if I gain a 4th Recruit or Bracelet?**  
  It is lost. You cannot have more than 3 of either.  
- **Can I use a Recruit to pay for both market pick and Explore cost on the same turn?**  
  Yes, if you have enough Recruits.  
- **Do Reputation gains stack cumulatively?**  
  No. Each turn, you gain VPs equal to your **current Reputation level** (i.e., position on track).  
- **Can I reserve a Destination Card I just explored?**  
  No. Reserved cards are taken from the market. Explored cards go directly to your tableau.  
- **If multiple players have largest Crew Zone when refreshing deck, who discards?**  
  All such players must each discard one card of their choice.
