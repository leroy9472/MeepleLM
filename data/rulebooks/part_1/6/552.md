## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In a rapidly expanding city, players manage competing bus lines to transport passengers between homes, offices, and pubs. The goal is to earn the most points by efficiently moving passengers to their destinations as dictated by the time of day. Strategic expansion of routes, control of building development, and timing of bus operations are key. The game ends when the city is fully developed, time collapses, or only one player remains active.

2. Components  
- Gameboard (city map and action area)  
- Clock face and clock hand with fastener  
- 5 glass Time stones  
- For each player (3–5 players):  
  - 20 Action markers  
  - 5 Bus tokens  
  - 1 Score disc  
  - Bus Line markers (sticks) in player color  
- 15 Passenger meeples  
- Building tiles: Houses, Offices, Pubs  
- Start bus token  

3. Setup  
- Assemble the clock by attaching the hand to the clock face; set it to "House".  
- Place the board in the center. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 20 Action markers  
  - 5 Bus tokens  
  - 1 Score disc  
  - Bus Line markers  
- Place Score disc on 0 of the score track.  
- Place 1 Bus token in the Buses area (depot) of the action board.  
- Place 4 passengers on the roundabouts adjacent to Central Park (1 per).  
- Place 5 Time stones on the clock (4 if playing with 3 players).  
- Determine starting player randomly; give them the Start bus token.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has three phases:  
1. **Choose Actions**: Players place Action markers on action spaces.  
2. **Resolve Actions**: Actions are resolved top to bottom, left to right.  
3. **Clean Up**: Spent Action markers are discarded. Next round begins.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Maximum Number of Buses (M)**: The highest number of buses any player has. Determines action power for Line Expansion, Passengers, and Buildings.  
- **Action Selection**:  
  - Minimum of 2 Action markers per player per round.  
  - Buses, Clock, and Starting Player can be chosen by only one player.  
  - Multi-use actions (Line Expansion, Passengers, Buildings, Vrroomm!) have spaces A–F. First player uses A, second B, etc.  
  - Players may pass after placing 2 markers.  
- **Action Resolution Order**:  
  - Top to bottom: Line Expansion → Buses → Passengers → Buildings → Clock → Vrroomm! → Starting Player.  
  - Multi-use actions: Resolve left to right (A last, F first for Line Expansion and Buildings; A first for Passengers and Vrroomm!).  
- **Action Details**:  
  - **Line Expansion**:  
    - Action power = M − (slot position: A=0, B=1, etc.). 5-player: +1 to action power.  
    - Extend line from one end. Must use unoccupied street if possible.  
    - Exceptions:  
      - If no unoccupied streets at an end, may overlap another player’s line.  
      - If your line end meets another player’s line end at an intersection, may overlap for one segment.  
    - If forming a loop, mark the junction point with a spent action marker to indicate two ends.  
  - **Buses**: Add 1 bus to your depot. If you now have the most buses, M increases immediately.  
  - **Passengers**:  
    - Action power = M − (slot position).  
    - Add passengers to either or both train stations.  
  - **Buildings**:  
    - Action power = M − (slot position).  
    - Place buildings on lowest-numbered unoccupied construction sites (1 → 2 → 3 → 4).  
    - Any building type may be chosen.  
  - **Clock**:  
    - Optional: Choose to stop time (keep clock hand, take 1 Time stone [−1 VP]) or advance clock (no stone).  
    - If last Time stone is taken, game ends immediately.  
    - After resolution:  
      - Move all passengers from buildings to their intersections.  
      - Move passengers at intersections matching the clock type onto empty buildings.  
  - **Vrroomm!**:  
    - For each action marker, use all your buses to transport 1 passenger each.  
    - Conditions:  
      - Passenger is at an intersection (not on a building).  
      - Passenger and destination are on your bus line.  
      - Destination is an empty building of the current clock type.  
    - Score 1 VP per passenger delivered.  
  - **Starting Player**: Take Start bus token for next round. If unclaimed, pass token clockwise.  
- **Spent Action Markers**: Returned to the box. Not reused.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Conditions (game ends immediately or at round end)**:  
  - Last Time stone is taken → end immediately.  
  - Only one player has Action markers left → end at round end.  
  - All construction sites are occupied → end at round end.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - 1 VP per passenger transported (via Vrroomm!).  
  - −1 VP per Time stone held.  
- **Winning**:  
  - Highest score wins.  
  - Tiebreaker 1: Most Time stones.  
  - Tiebreaker 2: Score marker lowest in its stack (reached score first).  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip part of an action?** No. Must perform fully or to maximum extent possible.  
- **Can I place multiple markers on the same action?** Yes, if spaces are available.  
- **What if action power ≤ 0?** No action is performed.  
- **Can my bus line cross itself?** Yes, but cannot overlap itself (no two of your markers on same street).  
- **Can I transport a passenger not adjacent to me?** Yes. Distance does not matter; only that both passenger and destination are on your line.  
- **5-player rule**: Only affects Line Expansion — action power is increased by 1.
