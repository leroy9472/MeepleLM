Each game proceeds in rounds. On a player’s turn:

   - Worker placement: Pay cost to use building; bump opponent or own worker if occupied.  
   - Retrieval: Take back all workers; cannot selectively retrieve.  
2. **Use Building Effect:** Pay cost, gain benefit, advance progress token if applicable.  
3. **Optional Item Use:** On your turn, pay 3 resources to complete an item card and gain its benefit; discard to general supply.  

**Key Buildings (The Commons):**  
- **Zeppelin:** Pay 3 influence + 4 specific resources → Construct a building in your charter. Gain 5 VP, advance progress.

  - A player starts turn with 0 influence (red zero).  
- Every 4th space has Reputation icon: player may claim Reputation, spending 1 influence.

- Finish the current round so all players have equal turns.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Bumping Workers:** You may bump your own or opponent’s regular worker. Minions cannot be bumped.  
- **Advancement Cards:** Gained from face-up mat, not deck. If no card of required type is available, no card is gained.  
- **Discarding vs Archiving:** Discarded cards go to general supply. Only archive when instructed (e.g., after unlocking crate).  
- **Assistants:** Bonus only triggers if already held before using building. Gaining assistant from building does not trigger its bonus.  
- **Minions:** Any player may use any unlocked minion. Benefit applies even if building benefit uses minion’s gain.  
- **Automa:**  
  - Does not advance progress token via Zeppelin/Charterstone/Grandstand.  
  - Gains minions each game; returns them at end.  
  - Does not spend influence on building or crate unlocking.  
- **Peril:** Once unlocked, peril tokens are part of setup in subsequent games. Cannot build over them unless using specific bonus.  
- **Income Buildings:** Pay influence to activate. Benefit triggers when progress token lands on income icon.  
- **Scrolls:** Can avoid building cost, but must still pay influence if required.  
- **Sky Islands (Recharge Pack):** Can build on top of existing buildings on sky islands. Cannot place on basic resource plots.
