  2. Remove specific beans based on player count:  
     - 3 players: Remove Cocoa Beans  
     - 4–5 players: Remove Coffee Beans  
     - 6–7 players: Remove Cocoa and Garden Beans  
  3. Shuffle remaining bean cards and deal:  
     - 3–5 players: 5 cards to each player  
     - 6–7 players: 3 to 1st, 4 to 2nd, 5 to 3rd, 6 to all others  
  4. Place rest face-down as draw pile (gold side up).  
  5. Each player gets a playmat:  
     - 3 players: Use 3-field side  
     - 4–7 players: Use 2-field side  
  6. Give Starting Player Card to first player.  
- **Hand Rules**:  
  - Players may **never** reorder their hand.  
  - New cards are added one at a time to the back (end) of the hand.  
  - First card in hand is always the oldest drawn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, execute these steps in order:

#### Step 1: Plant from Hand  
- Must plant the **first card** in hand.  
- May optionally plant the **new first card** (originally second).  
- Planting rules:  
  - A field may contain only one bean type.  
  - Plant in an empty field or same-type field.  
  - If no valid field, **must harvest** one field to free space, then plant.  
- If hand is empty, skip this step.

#### Step 2: Flip & Trade  
- Draw **top 2 cards** from draw pile and place face-up.  
- Active player may:  
  - Keep, trade, or donate these cards and/or cards from hand.  
  - Trade with one player at a time; all trades must involve active player.  
- Other players may only trade/donate cards from their **hands**.  
- Rules:  
  - Cards received in trade **cannot be traded further**.  
  - Players may not change hand order; remove cards only after agreement.  
  - Donations are allowed but must be accepted.  
  - Trading may continue even after face-up cards are gone.  
- End phase by declaring end of trading.

#### Step 3: Plant Traded & Received Beans  
- All players who received cards (via trade/donation) must plant them immediately.  
- Active player must plant any untraded face-up cards.  
- Plant in any order; harvest fields if needed to make space.  
- Planting must be completed before moving to next step.

#### Step 4: Draw New Cards  
- Active player draws:  
  - 3 cards (3–5 players), or  
  - 4 cards (6–7 players)  
- Draw one at a time, placing each at the **back** of hand.  
- If draw pile runs out:  
  - Shuffle discard pile to form new draw pile.  
  - Continue drawing.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Harvesting Beans  
- May be done **at any time**, even out of turn.  
- To harvest:  
  1. Count beans in a field.  
  2. Check Bean-o-meter on top card.  
  3. Flip that many cards to gold side (earn coins).  
  4. Discard remaining cards.  
  5. Field is now empty.  
- **Bean Protection Rule**:  
  - Cannot harvest a field with only 1 bean **unless all** of player’s fields have only 1 bean.  
- Harvesting may yield 0 coins (e.g., only 1 or 2 Stink Beans).

#### Buying a 3rd Bean Field  
- Once per game, a player may buy a 3rd field:  
  - Cost:  
    - 3 gold (3–5 players)  
    - 2 gold (6–7 players)  
  - Pay by placing gold cards (coin side down) on discard pile.  
  - Place 3rd Bean Field card in front of you.  
- Can be done at any time (even out of turn).  
- Cannot buy if fewer than required coins.  
- **Exception**: 3 players start with 3 fields; no purchase allowed.

#### Trading Rules  
- Only active player may initiate trades.  
- Active player may trade:  
  - Face-up cards and/or any cards from hand.  
- Other players may trade only from hand.  
- All trades must involve active player.  
- Cards received in trade are placed **face-up in front** of player (not in hand).  
- Cannot trade cards received in trade.  
- Donations allowed; receiver may refuse.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End**:  
  - Ends when draw pile is exhausted for:  
    - 2nd time (3 players)  
    - 3rd time (4–7 players)  
  - If it occurs during Step 2 (Flip & Trade):  
    - Complete Steps 2 and 3 for current player, then end game.  
  - If during Step 4: Game ends immediately.  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  1. All players harvest remaining fields.  
  2. Cards in hand are **discarded** (do not score).  
  3. Count gold coins (cards with gold side up).  
- **Winning**:  
  - Player with most gold wins.  
  - Tiebreaker: Among tied players, **most cards in hand** wins.  
    - If still tied (per full rules), player **furthest from starting player clockwise** wins.  
      *(Note: Some sources conflict; hand size is primary tiebreaker in most versions.)*
