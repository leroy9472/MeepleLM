### 1. Lore & Objective
Fire in the Lake (FitL) is a COIN-series board game simulating the Vietnam War, focusing on asymmetric conflict between four factions: the US, ARVN, NVA, and Viet Cong (VC). Each faction has distinct victory conditions based on control, support, opposition, and bases. Victory can be achieved through Sudden Death (meeting VP threshold at the start of a Coup Round) or by having the highest victory margin relative to threshold at game end.

- **US**: Victory threshold = 51 VP. VP = (Available US Troops/Bases) + (Support × Population).
- **ARVN**: Victory threshold = 51 VP. VP = (COIN-Controlled Population) + (Patronage).
- **NVA**: Victory threshold = 19 VP. VP = (NVA-Controlled Population) + (NVA Bases).
- **VC**: Victory threshold = 36 VP. VP = (Opposition × Population) + (VC Bases).

### 2. Components
- Game board depicting South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam.
- Faction-specific pieces: Troops, Guerrillas (Underground/Active), Bases, Rangers, Irregulars, Police.
- Markers: Terror, Sabotage, Aid, Patronage, Resources (R), Casualty, Out of Play, Trail value.
- Event and Coup cards.
- Player aids, control markers, and dice.

### 3. Setup
- **Short Scenario**: Three sets of 8 Event cards and 1 Coup card shuffled and stacked.
- Factions begin with starting forces, Resources, Aid, and Patronage as specified.
- Trail starts at value 2.
- Initial control and support levels set per scenario.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Event Phase**: Two cards are face-up. The first eligible faction chooses to conduct an Operation, invoke the Historical Event, or Pass.
2. **Action Resolution**: Only two factions may act per Event card. Action choice affects next faction’s options.
3. **Coup Round**: Triggered when a Coup card is drawn:
   - Apply card effect.
   - Adjust Control.
   - **Victory Phase (Sudden Death Check)**.
   - Proceed through Coup phases: Sabotage, Degrade Trail, Earnings, Casualties, Support (Pacification/Agitation), Redeploy, Commitment (non-final), Reset.
4. **Eligibility Reset**: After each Coup Round, all factions regain eligibility.

**Monsoon Rule**: On the last Event card before a Coup:
- No Sweep or March Operations.
- US Air Strike and Air Lift limited to 2 spaces.
- No Pivotal Events.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Operations**:
  - **Full Operation**: Affect multiple spaces.
  - **Limited Operation (LimOp)**: Affect one space only.
  - **Passing**: Grants Resources and preserves eligibility.
- **Special Activities**: Free and optional; accompany Operations:
  - **US**: Advise, Air Lift, Air Strike.
  - **ARVN**: Govern, Transport, Raid.
  - **NVA**: Infiltrate, Bombard, Ambush.
  - **VC**: Tax, Subvert, Ambush.
- **Coup Phases**:
  - **Sabotage**: LoCs with more Insurgents than COIN or adjacent to non-COIN-controlled cities get Sabotage markers.
  - **Degrade Trail**: If any Laos/Cambodia space lacks COIN Control, Trail degrades by 1.
  - **Earnings**: 
    - ARVN: (Econ + Aid) → Resources.
    - NVA: (# NVA Bases in Laos/Cambodia + 2×Trail) → Resources.
    - VC: (# VC Bases) → Resources.
  - **Casualties & Aid**: US casualties reduce Aid by 3 per casualty.
  - **Support Phase**:
    - **Pacification (US/ARVN)**: Up to 4 spaces. Costs 3R per level shifted. Removes Terror, shifts toward Active Support.
    - **Agitation (VC)**: Up to 4 spaces without COIN Control. Costs 1R per level. Removes Terror, shifts toward Active Opposition.
  - **Redeploy**:
    - ARVN: Troops must leave provinces without COIN Base; Police redeploy freely to COIN-controlled areas.
    - NVA: Troops may redeploy from any space to any NVA Base.
    - US/ARVN: Remove all pieces from Laos/Cambodia.
  - **Commitment (non-final Coup)**:
    - US: Move up to 10 Troops and 2 Bases from Available to map.
  - **Reset**: Trail resets (0→1, 4→3). All factions regain eligibility.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Sudden Death Victory**: Check at start of each Coup Round. If any faction meets VP threshold, game ends immediately.
- **Final Victory**: After last Coup Round, compare victory margins (VP – threshold). Highest margin wins.
- **Ties**: Ranked by VP, then by control of Saigon.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Eligibility**: Passing preserves eligibility; taking an action (Op or Event) forfeits eligibility on next card.
- **Base Building**: Max 2 Bases per space. VC/NVA build Bases via Rally (2 Guerrillas → 1 Base).
- **Underground Activation**: Guerrillas activate when moving into Support or LoC if total friendly + enemy pieces > 3.
- **Tunnel Bases**: Removed only on die roll (4–6) during Assault; marker removed, Base remains.
- **Resource Caps**: Max 75 for Resources, Aid, Patronage.
- **Negotiation**: Allowed but not binding.
