## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
**Objective**: Be the player with the lowest total score at the end of the game.  
Scoring: Sum of the lowest card in each consecutive sequence (run) + all standalone cards, minus 1 point per chip remaining.  

### 2. Components  
- 33 cards numbered 3–35  
- 55 Pass tokens (chips)  

### 3. Setup  
- Shuffle all 33 cards.  
- Remove 9 cards face-down and out of play (do not reveal).  
- The remaining 24 cards form a face-down draw pile.  
- Flip the top card to start the active card.  
- Distribute chips based on player count:  
  - 3–5 players: 11 chips each  
  - 6 players: 9 chips each  
  - 7 players: 7 chips each  
- Remaining chips are returned to the box.  
- Chips are kept hidden unless using the Open Chips variant.  
- Randomly choose the starting player.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, choose **one** of the following:  
1. **Place a chip** on the active card and pass the turn to the left.  
   - You **must** have at least one chip to do this.  
2. **Take the active card** and all chips on it.  
   - Add the card to your visible play area.  
   - Add collected chips to your supply.  
   - Reveal the next card from the draw pile (if any) to become the new active card.  
   - The player who took the card takes the next turn.  

**Play Area Rules**:  
- All taken cards are public.  
- If cards form a consecutive sequence (e.g., 12, 13, 14), they form a “run.” Overlap cards to show runs.  
- Only the lowest card in a run counts toward scoring.  

The game proceeds until the last card is taken and no cards remain in the draw pile.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Turn Order**: Clockwise, but the player who takes a card immediately takes the next turn.  
- **Chip Management**: Chips are critical to avoid taking high-value cards. Running out forces a player to take any active card.  
- **Scoring Optimization**: Players aim to collect consecutive cards to minimize points. Gaps in sequences score fully.  
- **Hidden Information**: The 9 removed cards are unknown, affecting risk assessment when building sequences.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when the last card is taken.  
To calculate final score:  
1. **Sum card points**:  
   - For each standalone card, add its full value.  
   - For each run, add only the value of the lowest card.  
2. **Subtract chips**: Deduct 1 point per chip remaining in your possession.  
3. **Total score** = (sum of relevant card values) – (number of chips left).  
- **Winner**: Player with the lowest score wins.  
- **Tiebreaker (unofficial)**: The player holding the highest card wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What if I have no chips?**  
  You cannot place a chip and **must take** the active card.  
- **Can I pass even if I want the card?**  
  Yes. Strategic passing builds up chips for future gain.  
- **Do removed cards affect play?**  
  Yes. They may block potential sequences (e.g., missing 18 prevents 17–19 run).  
- **Can a run be non-adjacent in play area?**  
  No. Runs are based on numeric sequence, not physical placement. Cards must be consecutive in value.  
- **Can a run have gaps?**  
  No. Only exact consecutive numbers count (e.g., 10,11,12). A gap (e.g., 10,12) creates two separate cards.
