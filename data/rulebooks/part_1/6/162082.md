## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
As the leader of an ancient civilization, explore unknown lands to develop your empire. Found cities, construct buildings, exploit natural resources, establish trade, conquer barbarian villages, and advance science. Honor the gods through offerings and temple construction.  

The **goal** is to earn the most victory points (VP) by the end of the game. The game ends when either:  
- All barbarian villages have been attacked (VP tokens removed), or  
- All temples from the general supply have been built.  

After the triggering condition, finish the current round, then all players take one final action. Final scoring determines the winner.

### 2. Components  
- 4 player boards  
- 96 Building cards (16 each of: civil, scientific, maritime, military, production, temple)  
- 100 wooden buildings (25 per player): 5 each of civil, scientific, maritime, military, production  
- 7 neutral wooden temples  
- 7 two-sided Continent tiles  
- Resources: 20 each of wood, stone, clay, wheat  
- Gold coins: 63 ×1, 12 ×5, 9 ×10  
- Victory Point (VP) tokens: 24 ×1, 9 ×3, 9 ×5, 17 ×10 (unlimited supply)  
- First Player card  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Form the gameboard**:  
   - 2 players: 4 Continent tiles  
   - 3 players: 6 tiles  
   - 4 players: 7 tiles  
   - Arrange tiles so no two barbarian villages are adjacent.  

2. **Place VP on barbarian villages**:  
   - For each barbarian village, place VP tokens equal to the number of adjacent regions (3–6 VP).  

3. **Form general supply**:  
   - Temples: 4 (2p), 6 (3p), or 7 (4p)  
   - Resources: 10 (2p), 15 (3p), or 20 (4p) of each type (wood, stone, clay, wheat)  
   - VP and gold: unlimited  

4. **Each player takes**:  
   - 1 player board and 25 matching-color wooden pieces (5 each type)  
   - Place 2 of each building type on corresponding columns of player board  
   - Remaining pieces form personal supply  
   - 5 gold, 1 of each resource, 5 VP  
   - 5 random Building cards (form starting hand)  

5. **Shuffle** remaining Building cards into draw deck.  
6. **Choose first player** and give them the First Player card.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, choose **one** of two actions:

#### A. Construct a Building  
1. **Play a Building card** from your hand.  
2. **Standard Building (civil, scientific, maritime, military, production)**:  
   - You must have at least one wooden piece of that type on your player board.  
   - Place card at top of corresponding column on your player board (visible effects).  
   - Pay construction cost (top-left of card) in resources and/or gold.  
     - Any resource may be replaced by 4 gold, even if you have the resource.  
   - Place matching wooden building on the gameboard:  
     - **First building**: Must be in an empty region at edge of board, ≥2 regions away from other players’ first buildings (if possible).  
     - **Subsequent buildings**: In a region you control, or adjacent to one you control.  
     - Cannot build in a barbarian village region (even if empty).  
     - Maritime buildings (ships) must be placed in sea regions.  
     - Other buildings cannot be placed in sea regions.  
     - Only one building of each type per region.  
     - Optional: Pay 3 VP to place any subsequent building at edge of board (bypass adjacency rule).  
   - **Activate all cards** in the column from **bottom to top**. Apply each effect.  

3. **Temple (purple card)**:  
   - **First temple**: No prerequisites.  
   - **Second temple**: Must have at least 1 card of each other color (civil, scientific, maritime, military, production) on your board.  
   - **Third temple**: Must have at least 2 cards of each other color.  
   - **nth temple**: Must have (n–1) cards of each other color.  
   - Pay cost: 1 of each resource (wheat, wood, stone, clay). Each may be replaced by 4 gold.  
   - Place wooden temple from supply in a region you control (not empty).  
     - Cannot have more than one temple per region.  
     - If only a military unit is in the region, it cannot be moved until another building is added.  
   - **Note**: You may play a temple card even if no temple pieces remain — just don’t place a piece.  

4. **Attack Barbarian Village (immediate)**:  
   After placing a building, check if any barbarian village is:  
   - Surrounded (all adjacent regions occupied), and  
   - At least one adjacent region contains a military unit (army).  
   - **Attacker**: Player with most armies adjacent wins all VP on the village.  
   - **Tie**: Player with most total buildings adjacent wins.  
   - **Still tied**: Share VP, rounded down.  
   - After attack, the region is no longer a barbarian village for card effects (but still cannot be built on).

5. **Empty hand check**:  
   If you have 0 cards after your action, draw 5 from deck.  
   If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.

#### B. Make an Offering to the Gods  
1. Discard **1 or more** cards from your hand, face-up to discard pile.  
   - Only the top card is visible to others.  
2. **God effect** is determined by **color of top discarded card**:  
   - Magnitude = number of cards discarded.  
   - Jupiter (purple) acts as a wild: choose any other god’s power.  

| God (Color) | Effect |  
|------------|-------|  
| **Neptune (blue)** | Gain 2 gold per discarded card. Gain 1 maritime building. |  
| **Ceres (green)** | Gain 1 resource of your choice per discarded card. Gain 1 production building. |  
| **Minerva (yellow)** | Gain 1 scientific building. Draw 1 extra card per discarded card (after refilling to 5). |  
| **Vesta (brown)** | Gain 1 VP (1 card discarded) or 2 VP (2+ cards). Gain 1 civil building. |  
| **Mars (red)** | Gain 1 wooden building of any type per discarded card. |  
| **Jupiter (purple)** | Choose any one of the above five god powers. |  

3. Draw cards to refill hand to 5.  
   - If Minerva was invoked, draw extra cards after refilling.  
   - **Hand limit**: 10 cards. Stop drawing if you reach 10.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Building Columns**: Each color column activates bottom-to-top when a new card is added. Effects may include VP, resources, coins, movement, or card draws.  
- **Resource Substitution**: During construction only, any resource may be replaced by 4 gold.  
- **Temple Prerequisites**: Progressive — each new temple requires increasing number of cards in other columns.  
- **Barbarian Attacks**: Triggered immediately when conditions are met.  
- **Hand Management**: Max 10 cards. Draw to 5 after offering or if hand is empty after construction.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger**:  
- All temples built, or  
- All barbarian villages attacked.  

Then:  
1. Finish current round.  
2. All players take **one final action**.  

**Final Scoring**:  
- VP earned during game (from cards, villages, offerings).  
- VP from **temple cards**: As indicated on each temple card (max 12 VP per temple).  
- **Majority Bonuses**: For each of the 5 categories (wood, stone, clay, wheat, gold), the player with the most (≥1) gains 2 VP.  
  - Tie: All tied players gain 2 VP.  

**Winner**: Player with most total VP. No tiebreaker.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build in a barbarian village after it's been attacked?**  
  No. Even after attack, the region remains unbuildable.  

- **Can I have more than one temple in a region?**  
  No. Only one temple per region.  

- **Can I abandon a temple?**  
  No. You must always control a region with a temple.  

- **What if I can’t pay a resource cost?**  
  You may substitute 4 gold per missing resource.  

- **Can I play a card if I have no wooden pieces left of that type?**  
  No — for standard buildings, you must have at least one on your board.  
  Exception: Temple cards can be played even if no temple pieces remain.  

- **Can I activate a column without gaining the card’s effect?**  
  Only via the Building Wildcard variant (see below).  

- **Building Wildcard (Variant)**:  
  Once per game, play any card face-down in any column. Pay 1 gold (1st), 2 gold (2nd), etc., based on column position.  
  - No effect from the card itself.  
  - Activate other cards in column.  
  - Counts toward temple prerequisites.  
  - Cannot be used to build a temple.
