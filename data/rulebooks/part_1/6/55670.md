## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Macao is a strategy board game set in the historical trading port of Macao, where players take on the roles of merchants competing to gain the most prestige through trade, city development, and political influence. The game lasts 12 rounds. Victory is determined by prestige points (PP), with tiebreakers based on position on the Wall. Players earn points through activated cards with "game end" scoring, city quarter chains, and direct purchases, while avoiding penalty markers that cost 3 points each.

2. Components  
- Player boards (tableaus) with wind roses  
- 6 dice (colored: red, blue, green, black, grey, violet)  
- Action cubes (ACs) in player colors  
- Gold coins (GC)  
- Ownership markers (colored discs)  
- Ship tokens  
- Prestige track (PP track)  
- Wall track (determines turn order)  
- 24 Office cards  
- Building/Person (B/P) cards (exact number not specified)  
- Goods tiles: Lacquer ware, Porcelain, Rice, Silk, Jade, Spices, Paper, Tea  
- Joker tiles (6 placed on dark city spaces at setup)  
- Beige discs for Tribute Table (track GC and PP values)  
- Punishment markers (−3 PP each)

3. Setup  
- Each player chooses a color and takes: player board, wind rose, ship, 2 discs (one for Wall, one for PP track), 12 ownership markers, 5 gold coins.  
- Place discs on Wall (top = first player) and PP track (starting at 0).  
- Place ships at the port (anchor space).  
- Shuffle Office cards and B/P cards separately.  
- Place 24 regular goods tiles on city spaces; place 6 Joker tiles on dark city spaces.  
- Reveal 2 Office cards and 4 B/P cards face-up.  
- Set Tribute Table: sum yellow numbers (bottom left of cards) for GC cost; sum red numbers (bottom right) for PP reward. Adjust beige discs accordingly.  
- For 2 players: discard last 2 B/P cards; for 3 players: discard last 1; for 4 or 5: keep all.  
- In reverse Wall order, each player selects one B/P card and places it on their tableau.  
- Each player places 1 AC (any color) on space 1 and 2 ACs (same color) on space 2 of their wind rose.  
- First player is the one highest on the Wall.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each of the 12 rounds proceeds in three phases:

**Phase 1: Cards**  
- Reveal 2 Office cards and 4 B/P cards.  
- Sum yellow numbers → set GC cost on Tribute Table.  
- Sum red numbers → set PP reward on Tribute Table.  
- Discard 0/1/2 B/P cards depending on player count (4/3/2 players).  
- In Wall order, each player must take one card (Office or B/P) and place it on their tableau.  
- If a player already has 5 cards (full tableau), adding a 6th requires discarding one card and taking a punishment marker.

**Phase 2: Dice**  
- Roll all 6 dice. Group by value.  
- Each player selects two dice and takes ACs matching the color and number shown.  
- Place ACs next to the corresponding number on their wind rose (e.g., red 3 → 3 red cubes at space 3).  
- Rotate wind rose one space clockwise. The arrow now points to the AC supply for the round.  
- If the arrow points to zero cubes, player immediately takes a punishment marker.  
- Starting in round 8, dice showing 5 or 6 become 1s.

**Phase 3: Actions**  
In Wall order, players take any number of actions using ACs from their supply (arrow points to available cubes). Actions may be taken in any order.

Available actions:  
- **Activate Cards**: Pay exact color and number of ACs shown on a card to move it from tableau to active area. Activated cards can be used during this phase.  
- **Occupy City Quarter**: Once per turn. Pay exact ACs shown on a city quarter to claim it. Take the goods or Joker tile and place your ownership marker. Cannot occupy a quarter already controlled.  
- **Move on Wall**: Once per turn. Pay 1 AC for first space, 2 ACs for each additional space moved this turn.  
- **Move Ship**: Pay 1 AC per space moved (ports count as spaces). Ship may change direction.  
  - If ship ends in a port, deliver one matching goods tile to the highest empty scoring space in that city. Score the points shown.  
- **Buy Prestige**: Once per turn. Pay GC as shown on Tribute Table to gain PP. Must pay full cost; no partial purchases.  
- **Use Cards**: Use activated cards (in play area). Unless specified otherwise, each card can be used once per turn. Cards not marked with a phase are used in Phase 3.  
- **Pass**: Discard all unused ACs. Player takes no further actions this round.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Action Cube Supply**: Determined by wind rose rotation. Unused cubes are lost at end of turn.  
- **Card Activation**: Cards on tableau must be activated (paid for) to be used. Once activated, they go to the play area and may be used once per turn (unless otherwise noted).  
- **City Occupation**: Each city quarter has a cost (color and number of ACs). Claiming gives goods/Joker and ownership. Largest contiguous chain (connected orthogonally, including tree/spider shapes) scores at game end.  
- **Joker Tiles**: Can be used as 1 AC of any color or 3 GC. Can be used immediately upon acquisition.  
- **Tribute Table**: Dynamic exchange rate (GC → PP) set each round by summing yellow (GC cost) and red (PP reward) numbers on drawn cards.  
- **Penalties**:  
  - 6th card on tableau → discard one, take punishment marker.  
  - Wind rose arrow points to 0 cubes → take punishment marker immediately.  
  - Unused ACs → discarded.  
- **Punishment Markers**: Each costs 3 PP at game end. Players never run out; use substitute if needed.  
- **Multi-use Cards**: Some cards can be used multiple times, but unless trackable, recommended to use only once per turn. All others are one-use per turn.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after 12 rounds (final round when last Office cards are revealed).

Final scoring:  
- Take one punishment marker for each card still on your tableau. (Exception: "Abbot" card protects from this.)  
- Lose 3 PP for each punishment marker.  
- Score PP from activated cards with "game end" ability (fulfill conditions if required).  
- City scoring: Score 2 PP for each ownership marker in your largest contiguous chain of city quarters.  
- Final prestige determines winner.  
- Tiebreaker: Player furthest along on the Wall wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you avoid the 0-cube penalty with a card or Joker?**  
  No. Penalty occurs immediately after wind rose rotation (Phase 2). Cards are used in Phase 3. Jokers cannot supply cubes before rotation.  
- **Can you use a card immediately after activating it?**  
  Yes. Cards may be used in the same turn they are activated.  
- **Are Office cards public?**  
  Yes. All 24 Office cards placed beside the board are public knowledge.  
- **Can ships occupy the same space?**  
  Yes. Multiple ships can be in the same port or sea space.  
- **Can you deliver goods without moving into the port this turn?**  
  No. You must move into the port (spend 1 AC to enter) to deliver goods. Being there from a previous turn is not enough.  
- **Can you use a Joker tile immediately after taking it?**  
  Yes. Joker tiles may be used at any time, including immediately upon acquisition.  
- **What if you can’t pay exact cost for a city quarter or card?**  
  You cannot partially pay. Must pay exact color and number of ACs shown.  
- **Can you use multiple cards in any order?**  
  Yes. Activated cards may be used in any order during Phase 3.  
- **Can you buy prestige points multiple times per turn?**  
  No. "Buy Prestige" is limited to once per turn.
