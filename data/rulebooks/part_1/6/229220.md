*Advanced Setup (optional):*
- Use Colony Board B-side.
- After rolling Blue Dice, place 4 Town Hall Tiles face-up with 1 random Scholar Tile under each (from unused Scholars).
- In counter-clockwise order (starting with player to right of Starting Player), each chooses one Town Hall + Scholar set.
- Immediately place Town Hall on Colony Board (covers 2 empty spaces, may rotate).
- Place Scholar Tile next to board — trained and usable from start.

*Variant: Common Pool of Blue Dice*
- Blue Dice are pooled with White Dice.
- Setup: Roll 1 Blue Die per player, add to common pool.
- When unlocking a Blue Die (via Religion Track), roll it and add to pool.
- Players may take Blue Dice from pool (max = unlocked count).
- Before new year, reroll all unlocked Blue Dice and return to pool.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 3 years. Each year:
1. Starting Player begins. Players take turns clockwise.
2. On your turn, take **exactly one** of these four main actions:
   - A. Expand your Colony
   - B. Activate a Single Building (using coins)
   - C. Activate a Row or Column (using a die)
   - D. Retire
3. You may also perform any number of Free Actions on your turn.
4. Play continues until all players have retired.
5. End of Year procedures occur.
6. Advance Year Marker. If Year 3, proceed to Final Scoring.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### A. Expand Your Colony
- Pay 2 Wood to take 1 Double Expansion Tile, OR
- Pay 2 Wood + 1 Grain to take 1 Triple Expansion Tile.
- Tile must be selected from the face-up Display (not drawn blind).
- Place tile over **empty spaces** on your Colony Board. May rotate. Cannot cover other tiles or pre-printed buildings. Cannot extend beyond 6×6 grid.
- Do not replenish the Display after taking a tile.

### B. Activate a Single Building
- Choose a **vacant** building (no die or coins on it).
- Pay coins: 1st activation this year = 1 coin, 2nd = 2 coins, 3rd = 3, etc.
- Activate the building’s effect.
- Coins remain on building until end of year.

### C. Activate a Row or Column
- Choose one die:
  - Take 1 White Die from common pool (max 3 per player per year), OR
  - Use 1 Blue Die from beside your Colony Board.
- You may pay 1 coin per pip to increase or decrease die value (no wrap: 1↔6 costs 5 coins).
- You may not take a die if the target row/column has no vacant buildings.
- **White Die**: Activate all **vacant buildings** in the **column** matching die value, from **top to bottom**. Place die on **bottommost** vacant building (blocks it).
- **Blue Die**: Activate all **vacant buildings** in the **row** matching die value, from **left to right**. Place die on **rightmost** vacant building (blocks it).
- Activate each building in order. Skip occupied buildings.

### Activating Buildings
All spaces on Expansion Tiles are either Buildings or Road Spaces. Pre-printed spaces on Colony Boards may also be buildings. Roads are never activated.

**Building Types:**
- **Production**: Gain shown resources, coins, or points. Storage limit: max 3 of any one resource (Wood, Grain, Sugar, Gems, Gold). Excess resources are sold immediately (1 coin for basic, 2 for advanced).
- **Trading**: Pay resources shown on top to gain coins, points, or resources on bottom. Choose one if "/" is present. Can be used only once per activation.
- **Shipping**: Pay resources shown on one face-up Shipment Tile (on dock). Take the tile, place it **face down** in your Harbor under the matching dock symbol. Immediately refill the dock from the stack (if available).
- **Conquistador**: Move your marker 1 space forward on the Conquistador Track. Stack on top of others. Gain 1 Gold when passing a Gold symbol. Gold is a wildcard resource.
- **Religion**: Move your marker 1 space forward on the Religion Track. Optionally pay 1 Grain to move 1 extra space (max 2 spaces per action). When passing a Monk symbol, you may place a Monk. When passing a Blue Die symbol, you unlock a Blue Die (take, roll, place beside board).

**Recruiting a Monk:**
- Place on one of 10 spaces: Scholar, Bishop, or Missionary Station.
- Cannot place on a space you already occupy.
- If space is occupied by others, pay 2 coins to each such player.
- Effects:
  - **Scholar**: Gain permanent ability. Score VP at end game (shown in purple).
  - **Bishop**: No immediate effect. Score VP at end game based on requirements. Lose 2 VP per Bishop.
  - **Missionary Station**: Immediate one-time effect (resources or points).

### D. Retire
1. Move your Market marker to a **vacant** Retiring Space. Resolve its effect:
   - 2 Coins
   - Religion Action (as per Religion building)
   - Conquistador Action (as per Conquistador building)
   - Shipping Action (as per Shipping building)
   - Take 1 Road Tile and place on any empty space in your colony
2. Then, receive income from **all** Shipment Tiles in your Harbor (top to bottom):
   - Each tile grants the action shown in its dock (Coins, Religion, Conquistador, Shipping, Road).
   - Carry out all actions in order.
3. You may still perform Free Actions and use Scholar abilities this turn.
4. You take no further actions this year.

### Free Actions (Unlimited, on your turn)
- Sell 1 Wood or Grain → 1 Coin
- Sell 1 Sugar, Gem, or Gold → 2 Coins
- Buy 1 Wood or Grain → 3 Coins (max 3 per resource type)
- You may sell excess resources immediately if you exceed storage limit.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends after Year 3.

**Final Scoring:**
1. **Remaining Resources and Coins**:
   - Sell all resources at standard rates.
   - Convert total coins to VP: 1 VP per 3 coins (round down).
2. **Colonists on Roads**:
   - For each **fully developed row or column** (all spaces filled with buildings or roads), score 1 VP per colonist on roads in that line.
   - A colonist may score twice (if in both a completed row and column).
3. **Monks**:
   - **Scholars**: Score VP shown on tile (in purple).
   - **Bishops**: First, lose 2 VP per Bishop. Then, score VP based on tile requirements:
     - *Build a Square*: Score 4/7/10 VP for 3×3/4×4/5×5 square (only one scored).
     - *Ships in One Dock*: 2 VP per tile in one dock (max 12).
     - *Cities Connected to Town Hall*: 2 VP per city connected by uninterrupted road (max 12).
     - *Colonists Connected to Town Hall*: 1 VP per colonist connected by uninterrupted road (max 12).
     - *Largest Area of One Terrain*: 2 VP per space in largest continuous area of Farm/Forest/Mountain (max 12).
     - *Diverse Column/Row*: 3 VP per row/column with at least one each of Farm, Forest, Mountain, City (max 12).
4. **Harbours**:
   - Score 3 VP per complete set (one tile in each of the four docks).
5. **Shipment Tiles**:
   - Flip all tiles face-up. Score VP shown on each.

**Winning**:
- Player with most VP wins.
- Tiebreaker: Player who used the highest Retiring Space (closest to "1st") in Year 3 wins.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Storage Limit**: If you gain a 4th resource, you must sell it immediately via Free Action (gain 1 or 2 coins).
- **Ties on Conquistador Track**: The player whose marker is lower in the stack (arrived first) is ahead.
- **No Tiles in Display**: Cannot Expand if no tiles are available.
- **End of Year Reset**: Only Conquistador Track resets. Religion Track, Monks, and unlocked Blue Dice persist.
- **Roads**: Never activated. Cannot have dice or coins. Used only for connectivity and scoring.
- **Gold**: Wildcard for all payments (Trading, Shipping, etc.).
- **Starting Player for Next Year**: Determined by highest Retiring Space used (closest to "1st" symbol).
