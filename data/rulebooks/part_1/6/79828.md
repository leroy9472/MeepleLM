   - Free actions may be taken at any time during your turn.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Expansion Actions
- **Settle a Location**:
  - Play a connected Location card + transport card (wagon, bateaux, ship).
  - If the location has a settler symbol, also play a settler-symbol card.
  - Place a village cube. Take the Location card from your Available Deck and place it on your discard pile.
  - Cannot settle if no cubes remain.

- **Develop a Location**:
  - Play the location’s card + a settler-symbol card.
  - Replace cube with disc (town); return cube to supply.
  - Only locations with VP value (purple hex) can be developed.
  - Limited by number of discs available.

- **Fortify a Location**:
  - Play the location’s card + Fortification card.
  - Pay $3.
  - Place a fort disc underneath the cube/disc.
  - Cannot fortify a besieged location.
  - Maximum one fort per location.
  - Forts provide +2 defense at start of siege and block raids.

### Aggressive Actions
- **Besiege a Location**:
  - Play a connected Location card + transport card + one military-symbol card.
  - Discard the first two cards.
  - Place the military card in your Siege Card space.
  - Place your Siege Marker on the targeted location.
  - Adjust the Siege Strength Marker:
    - Defender starts at “1” on the attacker’s Siege Track.
    - +2 if fortified.
    - +1 per defense symbol (crossed rifles) on location.
    - Move toward attacker by value of military symbols played.
  - Only one siege may be initiated per player at a time.

- **Reinforce a Siege**:
  - Play one card with military or ship symbol.
  - Add strength equal to number of symbols.
  - Card goes to Siege Card space.
  - Must be connected to the besieged location via controlled locations (rivers, lakes, roads, sea; not Indian trails).
  - Defenders may play a Fortification card for +1 strength (does not add a physical fort).
  - Ship symbols count as strength only if location has a ship symbol.

- **Raid**:
  - Play one or more eligible cards (e.g., Native American, Priest, Indian Leader).
  - First card allows raid up to 2 connections away; each additional card extends range by 1.
  - Movement via rivers, roads, lakes, Indian trails (not sea).
  - Cannot raid through or into fortified locations or besieged locations.
  - Can trace through a besieged location only if you are the attacker and it is unfortified.
  - Opponent may block by discarding:
    - A card that blocks raids
    - The location card of the target
  - No cost to block, even if using a Native American card.
  - If successful:
    - Take opponent’s cube or disc (worth VP at end).
    - If disc taken, opponent replaces with cube if available; otherwise, location becomes neutral.

  - Play an Ambush card.
  - Opponent may block with a card that allows blocking.
  - If unblocked, opponent must return one card with the ambush symbol (Native American profile) from hand or reserve to their Empire deck.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends immediately if:

Otherwise, at the start of a player’s turn, if:
- No sieges are in progress, AND
  - The player has placed all their cubes OR all their discs on the board, OR
  - The player has captured 12 VP worth of enemy cubes and discs (cubes = 2 VP, discs = 4 VP).

Then:
- **Scoring**:
  - For each controlled location: score VP value (in purple hex).
  - If town (disc) is present: double the VP.
  - +2 VP per captured enemy cube.
  - +4 VP per captured enemy disc.
- Highest total wins.
- Tie: French player wins.
