## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are sorcery students at the Horribilorum Sorcery Academy taking their final exam in potion-crafting. The objective is to become "Student of the Year" by earning the most victory points through brewing valuable potions and collecting Skill Tokens. Players use magical ingredients (represented by marbles) to complete potion recipes, trigger chain-reaction explosions, and strategically use special potion powers.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Dispenser (assembled from punchboard parts)  
- 80 Ingredient marbles (4 colors, 20 each)  
- 64 Potion tiles (8 types, each with unique magical effect)  
- 4 Desk boards (player boards with Bunsen burners and retort flask)  
- 15 Skill tokens (worth 4 points each)  
- 21 Little Help tokens (cost 2 points each at game end)  
- First Player token  

*Optional Expansion Components (mentioned in sources):*  
- Ghostly Cauldron with 12 wild (white) marbles  
- Professor tiles (some award Scolding Tokens, -1 pt)  
- Reward Tokens (+1 pt)  
- Mandragora leaves (special ingredient)  

### 3. Setup  
1. Assemble the Dispenser and place it in the center.  
2. Each player takes a Desk board and places it in front of them.  
3. Determine the First Player (e.g., most recently made a drink).  
4. Remove 2 of the 8 Potion types (e.g., Balm of Uttermost Stickiness and Filter of Lavamancing for beginners).  
5. Shuffle the remaining 6 types and create 5 face-up stacks from the leftover tiles after starter selection.  
6. Deal 2 starter Potion tiles per player:  
   - First, each player takes one tile clockwise starting from First Player.  
   - Then, each player takes a second tile counterclockwise starting from the last player.  
7. Players place their 2 starter Potions (Recipe side up) on their Desk’s Bunsen burners.  
8. Fill the Dispenser’s tank with all marbles and ensure the 5 slide tracks are full.  
9. Place Skill tokens and Little Help tokens near the Dispenser.  
10. Create a "countdown stack" of Skill tokens based on player count:  
   - 2 players: 4  
   - 3 players: 5  
   - 4 players: 6  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn:  
1. **Take 1 Ingredient**: Choose any visible marble from the Dispenser (except the 9th in each track).  
2. **Trigger Explosions**:  
   - Removing a marble may cause same-color marbles to collide → explosion.  
   - Take all marbles of that color connected to the collision.  
   - Chain reactions occur if new collisions happen after removal.  
3. **Optional Actions (any time during turn):**  
   - Drink one or more completed Potions (activate effect, rotate upside down).  
   - Use "A Little Help from the Professor" (once per turn): take 1 Help token and 1 marble (no explosion).  
4. **Place Ingredients**:  
   - Place matching marbles on empty holes of your Potions (by color).  
   - Remaining marbles go into your Ingredient Pool (max 3).  
   - You may move marbles between Pool and hand during your turn.  
5. **End of Turn**:  
   - Discard excess marbles (if Pool is full and hand has extras) to Dispenser.  
   - Refill Brewing area to 2 Potions by drawing from stacks.  
   - Check for Skill Tokens (3rd of a kind or 5th different type).  
   - Check if game end is triggered (countdown stack empty or no Potions left).  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Explosions**: Occur when same-color marbles collide after a removal. All connected marbles of that color are taken. Chain reactions continue if new collisions occur.  
- **Ingredient Pool**: Holds up to 3 marbles between turns. Cannot interact with Pool outside your turn.  
- **Potion Completion**: When all holes on a Potion tile are filled, return marbles to Dispenser, flip tile to completed side, and place in Potion area.  
- **Drinking Potions**: Activate one-time effects. Potion remains scored but is marked used (rotated). Effects include:  
  - **Potion of Wisdom**: Take any 1 marble (no explosion).  
  - **Elixir of Blind Love**: Steal all marbles from one opponent’s Pool.  
  - **Potion of Magnetical Attraction**: Take 2 adjacent marbles of different colors from same track.  
  - **Potion of Prismatic Joy**: Place all Pool marbles on any incomplete Potion holes (ignore color).  
  - **Abyssal Draft**: Take up to 1 marble of each color from bottom row (1 per track).  
  - **Sands of Time**: Reuse one previously used Potion effect.  
  - **Balm of Uttermost Stickiness**: Take 2+ adjacent same-color marbles from same track.  
  - **Filter of Lavamancing**: Discard up to 5 marbles of one color from same track back to tank.  
  - *Expansion Potions (examples)*:  
    - **Brew of Feather Touch**: Take 2+ adjacent same-color marbles from same row (any tracks).  
    - **Chameleonic Varnish**: Choose a color; all that color in hand act as another color.  
    - **Generosity Confection**: Take N adjacent marbles (N = players), give one to each opponent (or discard if full), keep one.  
    - **Concentrate of Selfishness**: Steal 1 marble from each opponent’s Pool.  
    - **Fulminating Serum**: Discard any 2 marbles from same track.  
    - **Lotion of Invisibility**: Steal 1 marble from opponent’s Pool or incomplete Potion.  
- **Refilling the Dispenser**:  
  - When returning marbles, roll randomly onto lid.  
  - Fill tracks evenly; move overflow to nearest empty track.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Game Triggered When**:  
  - Last Skill token from countdown stack is taken, OR  
  - No more Potion tiles available at end of a turn.  
- After trigger, all players get one final turn (until First Player’s right neighbor finishes).  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - Add points from all completed Potions (on tiles).  
  - Add 4 points per Skill token.  
  - Subtract 2 points per Little Help token.  
- **Tiebreaker**:  
  - Tied players take turns (starting with First Player) taking 1 marble from Dispenser (may trigger explosions).  
  - Player who collects the most marbles wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I trigger an explosion with a Potion or Little Help?**  
  No. Only the regular pick can trigger explosions.  
- **Can I complete more than 2 Potions per turn?**  
  No. You always have exactly 2 in your Brewing area at turn start. You may complete both, but cannot refill until end of turn.  
- **Can I use a Potion effect to take marbles that don’t match my current needs?**  
  Yes. You must still place them on matching Potion holes or store in Pool.  
- **What if I complete a Potion and have no space in Pool?**  
  Place required marbles on Potion first. Excess must go to Pool. If full, discard extras to Dispenser.  
- **Can I use Sands of Time on itself?**  
  No. You cannot reuse an already-used effect if it has been used again since.  
- **Can I use multiple Potions in one turn?**  
  Yes, at any point during your turn.  
- **What happens if the Dispenser runs low?**  
  Refill only when required (completing Potions or end of turn discards). Tracks can be partially empty.
