## SPLendor MARVEL: EPIC BATTLES – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Splendor Marvel: Epic Battles*, players take on the role of Marvel heroes assembling teams and engaging in legendary battles to earn powerful super-powers. These abilities provide lasting advantages and can contribute to victory points. The objective is to strategically claim battle cards by meeting their requirements, gain super-powers, and score points—either through powers or standard Splendor-style card acquisition—to be the first to trigger the end of the game and have the highest score.

This expansion is inspired by the "Trading Posts" module from the original Splendor and integrates with the base game mechanics using Infinity Gems (represented as gem tokens) and hero cards.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn:  
1. Take one action:  
   - Collect gem tokens  
   - Purchase a card  
   - Reserve a card  
2. **Optional – Claim a Battle (at end of turn):**  
   - If the player meets the requirement listed on any unclaimed (or shared) battle card, they may place one of their cubes on it.  
   - This grants the associated **super-power**, which lasts for the rest of the game.  
   - Claiming is **optional**, even if requirements are met.  
   - A player may only claim **up to 3** battle cards (one per cube).  
3. Super-powers take effect immediately and persist even if the requirement is later no longer met.  

> Note: Multiple players can claim the same battle card. Cards used to meet one battle's requirement can be reused for another.

| **Civil War** | 2 cards with Soul gem | When taking 2 gems of the same color, also take 1 additional gem of a different color |

> - Super-powers are **passive** and apply from turn of claim onward.  
> - Once claimed, a cube **cannot be moved or removed**.  
> - Players may use the same hero/gem cards to satisfy multiple battle requirements.  
> - Battle cards do **not** consume or discard cards; they are purely conditional triggers.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Standard Splendor scoring applies: Points from purchased cards and Avenger tiles.  
- Some super-powers grant **immediate or ongoing victory points**:
  - *Sinister Six*: +6 points (instant)
  - *Multiverse Madness*: 1 point per Time gem card
  - *Hail Hydra*: 1 point per claimed super-power (by that player)
- The game ends when **any player reaches 16 or more points** at the end of their turn (standard Splendor end condition).  
- All players take **one final turn**. Highest score wins.  
- Tiebreaker: Fewer total cards owned.

> Note: If a super-power grants points that push a player to 16+, the game ends immediately after that turn.
