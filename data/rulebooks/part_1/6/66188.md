### 3. Setup
**Board Setup:**
- Choose board side: 3-player (S1–S3) or 4-player (S1–S4).
- **Market:** Place market tiles in the bag. For 3 players, remove one each of the double-red, double-blue, and double-yellow tiles. Draw and place tiles face-up in market booths (3 booths for 3p, 4 for 4p).
- **Fresco:** Place the 24-value fresco tile in the center. Randomly remove 7 basic fresco tiles (3–11). Shuffle remaining basic and 6 special tiles (13–24), then place face-up on the fresco grid.
- **Bishop:** Place on the central fresco tile.
- **Coins:** Place in the studio, sorted by denomination.
- **Paints:** Place all paint pieces (including pink and brown) in the workshop, sorted by color.
- **Portrait Cards (Module 1):** Sort into piles A, B, C. Shuffle each, stack C (bottom), B, then A (top). Reveal top 2 cards and place face-up in studio.
- **Request Tiles (Module 2):** Sort by type (general, purple, green, orange). Place face-up in workshop, lowest value at bottom, highest on top.
- **Altar Tile (Module 3):** Place on the altar’s empty space.

**Player Setup:**
Each player receives:
- 1 small screen, 1 large screen (same color)
- 1 action sheet (side 1 visible)
- 1 yellow, 1 red, 1 blue paint piece
- 12 Thalers
- 3 master painters, 5 apprentices (same color)
- 1 blending reference card

**Place Master Painters:**
- 1 on a random starting space (S1–S3/S4)
- 1 above the hostel (top space)
- 1 on their color dot in the mood display (theater)

**Neutral Apprentices:**
- Place 1 unpainted apprentice above each +1 space in the mood display.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of two phases:

#### Phase 1: Choose Get-Up Time and Adjust Mood
- **Player Order:** The player with the fewest VPs goes first, then in ascending VP order. In case of ties, lowest VP position takes priority; if still tied, order from bottom to top on VP track.
- **Choose Get-Up Time:** Each player moves their master painter from above the hostel to an unoccupied get-up time (left column). Only one player per row.
- **Effects:**
  - **Mood Adjustment:** Move master painter on mood track up/down per center column. 
    - On +1: Take neutral apprentice (6 total actions this round).
    - On -1: Place one of your apprentices in front of your screen (4 total actions).
  - **Market Price:** Right column shows cost per market tile (1–4 Thalers).
  - **Action Order:** Determined by get-up time (earliest goes first).

#### Phase 2: Plan and Perform Actions
- **Plan:** All players simultaneously assign apprentices to action spaces behind their small screens. Only one apprentice per space.
- **Reveal:** All players reveal their action sheets.
- **Perform:** At each location, players act in get-up time order. Each player completes all actions at a location before the next player acts there. Actions may be forfeited.

**Locations and Actions:**

**Market:**
- Select one booth.
- **Buy Paints:** Each apprentice can buy one tile from the booth. Pay per tile according to get-up time. Take shown paints, return tile to bag.
- **Close Booth:** Forfeit buying; return all tiles from selected booth to bag. Counts as a free action.

**Cathedral:**
Each apprentice allows one of:
- **Restore Fresco Tile:**
  - Optionally pay 1 Thaler to move bishop 1 space (any direction).
  - Pay paints shown on tile.
  - Gain VPs: tile value + 3 if bishop on tile, +2 if adjacent.
  - Take tile, place face-down. Move bishop to restored space.
- **Restore Altar:**
  - **Option A:** 1 red, 1 blue, 1 yellow = 2 VPs. Substitute with green/orange/purple for +1 VP each.
  - **Option B:** 1 green, 1 orange, 1 purple = 6 VPs.
  - **Module 3:** Substitute pink (+3 VP each) or brown (+5 VP each).

**Studio:**
- **Base:** Each apprentice earns 3 Thalers.
- **Module 1:** One apprentice may take a face-up portrait card instead:
  - **∞ symbol:** Permanent benefit (e.g., extra income, mood boost).
  - **⚡ symbol:** Immediate one-time benefit (e.g., coins, paint, VPs).

**Workshop:**
- Each apprentice may blend paints up to 2 times:
  - Return required paints, take result (e.g., red + yellow = orange).
  - Newly blended paint can be reused in same turn.
- **Module 2:** One apprentice per player may fulfill a request instead:
  - **General Request (coins):** Any 3 face-down fresco tiles.
  - **Special Request (color splash):** 3 tiles with matching back color (purple, green, orange).
  - Stack 3 tiles, take request tile, gain VPs, place tile face-down on stack. Request grants ongoing income (1 Thaler + paint).

**Theater:**
- Each apprentice moves master painter up 2 spaces on mood track (max at top).
- **Note:** Mood changes affect next round’s get-up phase.

#### After Actions: Prepare for Next Round
- **Market:** Return remaining tiles to bag. Draw new tiles to refill booths.
- **Portrait Cards (Module 1):** Discard unrevealed cards. Reveal 2 new cards.
- **Income:** Each player receives 1 Thaler per face-down fresco tile and per fulfilled request tile.
- **Move Master Painters:** Return to top of hostel.
- **Next Round:** Lowest VP player starts.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Mood System:** Affects number of available apprentices (4–6).
- **Bishop Movement:** Strategic placement increases VP gains (up to +3).
- **Paint Blending:** Enables access to secondary (green, orange, purple) and tertiary (pink, brown) colors.
- **Request Fulfillment (Module 2):** Converts tiles into recurring income and VP.
- **Portrait Cards (Module 1):** Provide passive or active advantages.
- **Action Planning:** Simultaneous, hidden planning with strict location-based action execution.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End Game Triggers (at start of round):**
- 6 or fewer fresco tiles remain on the board.
- **Module 1:** Last two portrait cards are revealed.
- **Alternative:** Fresco fully restored during a round — immediate final round.

**Final Round:**
- Flip action sheets to side 2.
- No income is paid at end of round.
- Theater cannot be visited; Cathedral may be visited twice.

**Final Scoring:**
- Players gain 1 VP per 2 Thalers (round down).
- Awarded in get-up time order of final round.
- If VP track space is occupied during final scoring, move to next empty space.

**Winning:**
- Highest total VP wins. No tiebreaker needed (players cannot occupy same VP space).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **VP Track Occupancy:** If a player’s VP movement lands on an occupied space, choose to move forward or backward to the next empty space.
- **Bishop Movement:** Can be moved before any fresco restoration, even if no restoration occurs.
- **Blending:** Paints blended in one action can be used in a second blend by the same apprentice.
- **Request Tiles:** Once fulfilled, they remain in play, providing income each round.
- **Portrait Cards:** Only one card can be taken per round; additional studio apprentices only earn money.
- **Final Round Income:** No income is paid, even if tiles or requests would generate it.
- **Ties in VP Order:** Use reverse order of VP track position (lowest VP first). If still tied, use bottom-to-top order on track.
