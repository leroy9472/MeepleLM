## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Lore: Not provided in the source material.  
Objective: Win the game by scoring the most victory points (VP) through acquiring Company Tiles, strategic bidding, and fulfilling various scoring conditions.

2. Components  
- Company Tiles (with printed VP values, country associations, and industry types)  
- Bid Tiles (for writing bid amounts)  
- Player Score Boards (to track bids, VP, and scoring markers)  
- First Auctioneer Token  
- Dry-erase markers and erasers  
(Note: Exact component counts are not specified in the source.)

3. Setup  
- Determine player count (3, 4, or 5 players).  
- Shuffle the Company Tiles and form a face-down stack.  
- Each player receives a Player Score Board and Bid Tiles.  
- Give the First Auctioneer Token to one player (determines auction order).  
- Distribute dry-erase markers.  
- The game will last 16 turns for 3 or 4 players, or 15 turns for 5 players.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn consists of 5 phases:

1. Opening Bid  
   - The Auctioneer reveals the top Company Tile and places it face up.  
   - The Auctioneer writes a positive whole number bid on their Bid Tile and places it face up.

2. Secret Bids  
   - All other players simultaneously write their bids on Bid Tiles.  
   - Bids must be a positive whole number or zero.  
   - No player may bid the same amount as the Auctioneer.  
   - Players hand their bids to the Auctioneer without revealing them.

3. Award the Company Tile  
   - The Auctioneer examines all bids.  
   - The highest bidder wins the Company Tile.  
   - The Auctioneer secretly writes the winning bid amount on the back of the Company Tile.  
   - The Company Tile is given to the winner, placed face up.  
   - If the Auctioneer wins, they must openly record the winning bid.  
   - Players may always check the bid amounts on their own previously won tiles.

4. Reveal Zero Bids and Record VP (Skip in 3-player games)  
   - The Auctioneer reveals any zero bids.  
   - Each player who bid zero receives 2 VP.  
   - Mark the 2 VP space for that round on the Player Score Board.  
   - Each player may score the 2 VP bonus only once per round.

5. Pass Auctioneer Role  
   - The First Auctioneer Token passes clockwise to the next player.  
   - A new round begins when the player with the First Auctioneer Token holds an auction.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Auction System: Each turn features a blind auction with one player as the Auctioneer.  
- Bidding:  
  - Auctioneer bids openly.  
  - Other players bid secretly.  
  - Bids are positive integers or zero (but cannot match Auctioneer’s bid).  
- Winning: Highest bid wins the Company Tile.  
- Tied Auction:  
  - If two or more players tie for highest bid, tied players rebid.  
  - Rebid follows normal rules (can be same or different amount, but cannot match new Auctioneer bid if applicable).  
  - If tied three times in a row, the highest non-tied bid wins.  
- Spending Tracking: Winning bids are recorded on the back of Company Tiles. Total spent matters for tiebreakers.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after:  
- 16 turns (3 or 4 players)  
- 15 turns (5 players)  

Final Scoring:  
- Add VP values printed on all Company Tiles.  
- Score 2 VP for each round in which you bid zero at least once (max once per round).  
- Score 3 VP for having 2 Company Tiles matching your country.  
- Score 6 VP for having 3 Financial Companies.  
- Score 3 VP for having 2 Manufacturing Companies.  
- Score 8 VP for having Companies in 4 different Industries.  
- Score 6 VP if you made the lowest total bid across all auctions (i.e., spent the least overall).  
- Sum all categories for Grand Total.  

Tied Game:  
- The player who spent the least total amount wins.  
- If still tied, no further tiebreaker is specified.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can a player bid zero more than once per round?  
  A: Yes, but the 2 VP bonus is only scored once per round, even with multiple zero bids.

- Q: What happens if all players bid zero?  
  A: The highest bid is zero. The Auctioneer wins if they bid zero (since they are eligible), or the tiebreaker rules apply.

- Q: When does a round end?  
  A: A round ends when every player has been the Auctioneer once. A new round begins when the player with the First Auctioneer Token holds an auction again.

- Q: 3-player game – Last Turn Rule  
  A: On the final turn, there is no Auctioneer. All three players submit secret bids. Highest bid wins. In case of a tie, no one gets the Company Tile.

- Q: 5-player game – One Peek Rule  
  A: Each player may, once per game, request to see the winning bid of any past auction. After viewing, they cross off the “See the winning bid” spot on their board.

- Q: Can players see others’ winning bid amounts?  
  A: No, unless they are the Auctioneer who won (then it's public), or they use their one peek (in 5-player games).

- Q: Can the Auctioneer bid the same as a previous round?  
  A: Yes, but not the same as any other player in the current round.
