## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *The Manhattan Project*, players lead nations in a race to develop nuclear weapons during the dawn of the atomic age. The objective is to score victory points (VPs) by building, testing, and loading bombs. The first player to reach the victory point threshold wins immediately.

**Victory Point Thresholds by Player Count:**  
- 2 Players: 70 points  
- 3 Players: 60 points  
- 4 Players: 50 points  
- 5 Players: 45 points  

In solo play (without Robot), the goal is to score **at least 100 points**. Final score is calculated as:  
**Final Score = floor(Total Points / Number of Rounds)**  
Example: 103 points over 8 rounds → 12 final score.

   - Place one token of each player’s color on the bottom of the Plutonium, Uranium, and Espionage tracks.  
   - Create General Supply with:  
     - Building Deck (shuffle 6 Starting Buildings, place in $2–$10 spots; place top of regular deck on $20 spot)  
     - Bomb Cards (shuffle, draw face-up supply = players + 1)

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, choose **one** of two actions:  

#### A. Place Workers  
1. **Place 1 Worker on Main Board** (optional, except Construction allows multiple).  
2. **Place Workers on any number of your Buildings** (and/or opponent Buildings via Espionage).  
   - You may repeat Step 2 as long as you have Workers and valid placements.  
3. **At any time during your turn**, perform any number of Bomb Actions (Build, Test, Load).  

#### B. Retrieve Workers  
1. Return all your permanent Workers from Main Board and other players’ boards.  
2. Return all Workers on your Buildings, Bombs, and Implosion Test counters to their supplies.  
3. Return all Contractors (from Main Board and your supply) to General Supply.  
   - **Note:** Retrieval must result in at least one permanent Worker returned. If not, you must Place Workers.  

After retrieval, increase round counter (in solo: increment die by 1).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Worker Placement  
- **Types:** Laborer, Engineer, Scientist, Contractor (grey).  
- **Requirements:** Must match symbols on space/card.  
  - Slash (/): choose one option.  
  - Question mark (?): any Worker type.  
- **Limits:**  
  - Most spaces hold 1 Worker.  
  - Construction: unlimited Workers.  
  - Design Bombs: holds exactly 2 (Engineer + Scientist).  
- **Damaged Buildings:** Cannot place Workers on them.  

#### Main Board Actions  
| Space | Action | Notes |  
|-------|-------|-------|  
| **Construction** | Pay cost to buy Building | Engineer → free $2 or $3 Building |  
| **Factories** | Gain $ (left: pay 3 Yellowcake; middle: +$2 to others; right: needs Engineer/Scientist) | Add $1 to Bribe Pile |  
| **Aircraft Factories** | Left: +2 Fighters; Right: +2 Bombers | Max 10 each |  
| **Mines** | Left: pay $5 → 4 Yellowcake; Middle: get 3 +1 to others; Right: Engineer → +2 | |  
| **Universities** | Left: +3 Laborers; 2nd: +1 Engineer; 3rd: +1 Scientist; Right: $3 → 1 Engineer or Scientist | Take from General Supply |  
| **Reactor** | Scientist + 2 Yellowcake → +1 Plutonium | Max 8 |  
| **Enrichment Plant** | Scientist + $3 + 2 Yellowcake → +1 Uranium | Max 8 |  
| **Air Strike** | Launch attacks: | |  
| | - **Fighter Attack:** Spend 1 Fighter → destroy 1 enemy aircraft | |  
| | - **Bomber Run:** Spend 1 Bomber → damage 1 enemy Building (only if no enemy Fighters) | |  
| **Repair** | Pay $5 → remove up to 3 damage from your Buildings | Others may pay $2/$3/$5 for 1/2/3 points |  
| **Design Bombs** | Place Engineer + Scientist → all players take 1 Bomb Card | You get 2 total |  
| **Espionage** | Pay $3 → gain 1 Spy | Enables placing Workers on opponent Buildings this turn |  

#### Bomb Actions (during Place Workers turn)  
1. **Build Bomb:**  
   - Play Bomb card from hand.  
   - Assign required Workers.  
   - Spend required fuel (Uranium or Plutonium).  
   - Score points shown.  

2. **Implosion Test (Plutonium only):**  
   - Only once per game.  
   - Return any built Plutonium Bomb to bottom of deck.  
   - Take highest-value Implosion Test counter (score its points).  
   - All future Plutonium Bombs score higher VP (red number).  

3. **Load Bomb:**  
   - Pay load cost.  
   - Spend 1 Bomber.  
   - Place Loaded Bomb marker (+5 VP).  
   - Only one load per bomb.  

#### Solo-Specific Rules  
- **Round Tracking:** After retrieving Workers, increase round die by 1. Use second die after round 6.  
- **Bomb Cards:** Always 3 face-up.  
  - Use "Bomb card selection" action: choose 1, discard 2, draw 3 new.  
  - If deck runs out: **lose the game**.  
- **Detonate a Bomb:** Execute normally, take scoring card from under game token. Higher values now apply.  
- **Air Strike:** Use Fighters/Bombers to remove Building cards from market (value ≤ number of aircraft used).  
- **Spy:** Look at blind Building deck up to number of Spies; reorder or remove cards seen.  
- **Repair:** Reuse personal Building card by removing tokens (must re-earn them).  
- **Personal Board Full:** Place new Building on non-occupied card if possible.  
- **Ignore:** Benefits to other players on Main Board; Damage token effects.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Scoring Sources:**  
  - Building Bombs: VP on card  
  - Implosion Test: VP from counter (replaces bomb’s VP)  
  - Loaded Bombs: +5 VP each  
- **Game End:**  
  - **Multiplayer:** Ends immediately when any player reaches VP threshold.  
  - **Solo (without Robot):** Play until Bomb deck is exhausted or you choose to stop.  
    - Score total VPs.  
    - Final Score = floor(Total Points / Number of Rounds)  
    - Goal: beat 12 (103/8) or set personal best.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a Worker without taking the action?**  
  Yes, as long as requirements are met. Useful for blocking.  
- **Can I use a Building that’s damaged?**  
  No. Workers cannot be placed. Existing Workers are safe until retrieval.  
- **What happens if I can’t retrieve any Workers?**  
  You must choose Place Workers instead.  
- **Can I Build, Test, and Load in one turn?**  
  Yes — all Bomb Actions can be taken in any order during a Place Workers turn.  
- **What if the General Supply runs out of Yellowcake or Money?**  
  Use substitutes — these are unlimited.  
- **Can I load a bomb that’s already been tested?**  
  Yes — Load and Test are independent actions.  
- **In solo, what if I run out of Bomb Cards?**  
  You lose the game. Maintain at least 3 face-up cards at all times.  
- **Do I get Bribe Pile money when building $2 Building in solo?**  
  Yes — rule applies unless specified otherwise.
