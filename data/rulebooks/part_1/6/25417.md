# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
BattleLore is a tactical miniatures wargame where players command armies on a hex-based battlefield. The objective is to defeat the enemy army by capturing Victory Banners, typically by eliminating enemy units (especially banner bearers). The game combines card-driven activation, unit-specific movement and combat abilities, and terrain effects to create dynamic medieval battles.

## 2. Components
- Miniature figures and banners (various troop types and colors)
- Hexagonal terrain tiles (Wooded, Elevated, Waterways, Fords, Bridges, Ramparts, Landmarks)
- Command Cards (Section and Tactic cards)
- Lore Cards (Warrior, Rogue, Cleric, Wizard)
- Battle Dice (custom dice with symbols)
- Lore Tokens
- Victory Banner tokens
- War Council Sheets (for Lore Adventures)
- Hero figures, character sheets, Skill and Artifact cards

## 3. Setup
1. Assemble the battlefield using terrain hexes according to the adventure or scenario.
2. Each player sets up their army on their side of the battlefield, typically on baseline hexes.
3. Shuffle the Command deck and deal the required number of cards to each player.
4. For Lore Adventures: set up War Councils, prepare Lore decks, deal Lore cards, and distribute Lore tokens.
5. Place Landmarks (Stronghold, Training Camp, Healing Pool, etc.) as specified.
6. Players may deploy one Hero to a Hero-friendly hex (foot or mounted unit) before the first turn.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Players alternate turns following this sequence:
1. **Command**: Play one Command card (Section or Tactic card).
2. **Order**: Announce which units will be ordered (number depends on card played).
3. **Movement**: Move each ordered unit one at a time.
4. **Combat**: Battle with each ordered unit one at a time.
5. **Draw and End of Turn**: Discard the played Command card and draw a replacement. In Lore games, gain Lore tokens/cards.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Unit Types & Movement
**Foot Units:**
- Green: Move 2 hexes, battle with 2 dice
- Blue: Move 1 hex, battle with 3 dice; or move 2 hexes, no battle
- Red: Move 1 hex, battle with 4 dice

**Mounted Units:**
- Green: Move 4 hexes, battle with 2 dice
- Blue: Move 3 hexes, battle with 3 dice
- Red: Move 2 hexes, battle with 4 dice

### Combat
- **Melee**: Against adjacent units
- **Ranged**: Up to weapon's range (4 hexes for Common Bow, 3 for Crossbow, etc.)
- **Battle Dice**: Number rolled depends on unit's banner color and weapon
- **Hits**: Scored by matching colored Helmet symbols to target's banner color
- **Flags**: Cause retreats; number of hexes depends on unit's morale

### Weapons
- **Melee Weapons** (Short Sword, Long Sword, Battle Axe, etc.): Adjacent combat only
- **Ranged Weapons** (Common Bow, Crossbow, etc.): Point Blank (adjacent) and ranged attacks
- **Special Rules**: Some weapons reduce dice when used on the move; some ignore flags against mounted units

### Morale
- **Bold**: May ignore 1 flag per level; may Battle Back
- **Normal**: Retreat 1 hex per flag; lose figure for each hex unable to retreat
- **Frightened**: Retreat 2 hexes per flag; check for panic losses (opponent rolls dice, matching color kills figure)

### Special Rules
- **Medieval Tactics**: 
  - Attacker kills/forces retreat → GAIN GROUND (Foot) or PURSUIT + BONUS ATTACK (Mounted)
  - Defender is Bold and not forced to retreat → BATTLE BACK
- **Support**: Unit adjacent to 2+ friendly units is Bold
- **Line of Sight**: Required for ranged attacks; blocked by terrain/units

### Landmarks
- **Stronghold (Commander)**: Adjacent units are Bold; if captured, owner loses 1 Command card
- **Training Camp (Warrior)**: Ordered unit upgrades banner color, then camp disappears
- **Healing Pool (Cleric)**: Weakened unit heals to full, then pool disappears
- **Rogue's Den (Rogue)**: Use secret passage (1 Lore/unit) to Wooded or Elevated hex
- **Magic Pentacle (Wizard)**: Collect 1 Lore token at end of each turn if occupied

### Heroes
- **Champion**: Solo unit; move 2 hexes (foot) or 4 hexes (mounted)
- **Leader**: Joins friendly unit; both move and battle together
- **Casualty Check**: Required when hit; opponent rolls dice, Sword symbol wounds Hero
- **Artifacts & Skills**: Provide special abilities; Champions/Leaders have role-specific artifacts

### Creatures
- May be ordered out-of-section for 3 Lore
- Killed only by Critical Hits (roll after taking damage)
- Bold but must ignore 1 flag
- Provide support but don't receive it
- Trample units blocking retreat

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Banners**: Awarded when eliminating enemy units, especially banner bearers
- **Game End**: When a player reaches the required number of Victory Banners (typically 6-7)
- **Hero System**: In campaign play, Heroes gain Experience, Skills, and Artifacts between battles

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Two units per hex**: Not allowed; units cannot move through occupied hexes
- **Retreats**: Must move directly toward own baseline; blocked retreats cause casualties
- **Tactic Cards**: Some affect Heroes (e.g., Leadership orders all Leaders)
- **Lore Cards**: Reaction cards can be played during opponent's turn
- **Hero Deployment**: Must have matching Lore Master on War Council
- **Critical Hits**: Required to eliminate Creatures; roll after damage is applied
