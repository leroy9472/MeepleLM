## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Wings of War is a tactical card-based wargame simulating aerial duels between pilots of the First World War. Players take on the roles of fighter pilots, commanding aircraft from opposing sides—typically Central Powers vs. Allied forces. The core objective is to eliminate enemy aircraft through maneuvering and gunfire, using historically inspired planes and flight mechanics. Victory is achieved by being the last player or team with aircraft still in play.

### 2. Components  
Each game set includes:  
- **Airplane Cards**: Represent individual aircraft, with blue letters indicating maneuver decks and red letters indicating damage decks. Two-seater planes have two red letters (front and rear machine guns).  
- **Maneuver Decks**: Four decks (F, G, H, J, K, L, N, O, P) corresponding to different aircraft models. Each card shows a movement vector with symbols:  
  - $\uparrow$: Straight maneuver  
  - $\diamond$: Steep maneuver (cannot be played consecutively)  
  - $\downarrow$: Immelmann turn (requires straight before and after)  
- **Damage Deck**: Cards with damage values and special effects; letter-matched to the red letter(s) on airplane cards.  
- **Counters Set (36 total)**: Includes jammed, smoke, flame, stall, and mission-specific counters (e.g., bombs, cameras, cockades).  
- **Gameboards (5 total)**: One per airplane model; used to plan maneuvers and track damage/status.  
- **Rulers**: Two with red half-mark; used to measure firing range and tailing.

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose a flat playing surface (minimum 70 cm wide; larger for multi-plane scenarios).  
2. Each player/team selects equal numbers of airplane cards, placing them at opposite ends of the field.  
3. Assign each airplane its matching **gameboard** and load the correct **Maneuver deck** (via blue letter).  
4. Prepare **Damage decks** using the red letter(s) on each airplane card. For two-seaters, maintain separate decks for front and rear guns.  
5. Place target cards (for bombing/photo missions) as specified in scenarios.  
6. Position planes at starting points per scenario (e.g., half ruler length from edge).

Players may use multiple aircraft; each is controlled separately.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn consists of three phases:  

#### Planning Phase  
- Each player selects **three Maneuver cards** per aircraft and places them face-down in order (1st, 2nd, 3rd) on the gameboard.  
- Restrictions:  
  - No two **steep maneuvers** ($\diamond$) in a row.  
  - **Immelmann turn** ($\downarrow$) must be preceded and followed by a straight ($\uparrow$).  
    - Exception: If the previous turn ended with a straight, an Immelmann may open the next turn.

#### Movement & Fire Phases (x3 per turn)  
1. **Reveal** the first Maneuver card for all aircraft.  
2. **Move** each plane:  
   - Align the maneuver card’s tail with the plane’s nose (blue line).  
   - Slide the plane so its tail matches the arrowhead.  
   - Remove and return the maneuver card to unused pile.  
3. **Check Firing**:  
   - Use ruler from center red dot of firing plane.  
   - Target must be within **firing cone** (area between red lines on plane card).  
   - Ruler must not pass through any other plane (firing blocked).  
   - **Range**:  
     - First half of ruler → **2 damage cards**  
     - Second half → **1 damage card**  
   - Two-seater planes may fire **front and rear arcs separately**, each at different targets.  
4. **Apply Damage**:  
   - Draw damage cards from deck matching the red letter of the firing arc.  
   - Owner views cards secretly, sums numbers.  
   - If total ≥ green number on target card → **plane shot down**.  
   - Reveal only if card has **explosion symbol** (immediate elimination) or **jammed gun symbol** (affects shooter).  

Repeat for second and third maneuvers.  

After third phase:  
- Return used maneuver cards to decks.  
- Place **status counters** on gameboard:  
  - Steep maneuver performed → place **steep counter** (blocks next steep).  
  - Immelmann performed → place **Immelmann counter** (allows next turn to start with straight or Immelmann).  
  - Straight maneuver → place **straight counter** (allows next turn to start with Immelmann).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Special Damages (Keep Secret Unless Noted)  
- $\Leftrightarrow$: **Rudder jammed – no left turns** next turn.  
- $\Rightarrow$: **Rudder jammed – no right turns** next turn.  
- $\mathcal{O}$: **Observer incapacitated** – two-seaters lose rear gun.  
- $\mathbf{\Theta}$: **Engine damaged** – must play **one stall maneuver** ($\diamond$ + short arrow) per turn. Second engine hit = explosion.  
- $\mathcal{P}$: **Smoke trail** – cannot perform **tailing**, lasts 3 turns (discard one counter per turn).  
- $\mathcal{A}$: **On fire** – discard one flame counter per turn, draw A-damage card (only damage/explosion counts). Smoke effect also applies.  

Multiple different special damages apply. Duplicates: only most recent counts.

#### Aim Bonus  
- If same plane fires at same target in same arc for **consecutive phases**, starting from the **second phase**, each damage card scores **+1** (0 remains 0).  
- Track bonus damage separately on gameboard.

#### Tailing  
- At turn start, check if tailing is possible:  
  - Ruler connects center of rear plane to center of front plane.  
  - Passes through **rear side** of tailing plane and **front side** of tailed plane.  
  - No other plane in between.  
- If yes:  
  - Tailed player reveals **first maneuver card** to tailing player.  
  - Tailing player may **reorder** their three planned maneuvers.  
  - After first move, if tailing still valid:  
    - Tailed reveals **second card**, tailing player may reorder remaining two.  
- Only valid if position existed at **start of turn**.

#### Blind Spot (Rear Guns)  
- Rear gun of two-seaters **cannot fire** if target is directly behind tail.  
- Test: ruler from center of two-seater to target.  
- If ruler touches target with **first half** and passes through **rear side** of two-seater → **firing blocked**.

#### Overlapping  
- If two planes overlap:  
  - **Neither can fire at each other**.  
  - Both **can fire at other planes** normally.  
  - Others can fire at overlapping planes.

#### Exit from Playing Area  
- Plane exits if its **central dot** crosses boundary → **eliminated**.  
- Counts as "gone out" for scoring.

#### Getting Out of Control  
- Playing illegal maneuver (e.g., two steeps in a row, invalid Immelmann) → when revealed, plane is **eliminated immediately**.  
- Counts as **shot down**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Victory Conditions  
- **Last player/team with aircraft in play wins.**  
- Aircraft eliminated via damage, exit, or illegal move all count as lost.

#### Match Scoring (for multiple matches)  
Winning player/team scores:  
- **+1** per enemy aircraft that exited playing area  
- **+2** per enemy aircraft shot down  
- **–1** per own aircraft shot down  

Used to compare performance across matches.

#### Scenario-Specific Goals  
Some scenarios award bonus points:  
- **Bombing/Photographic missions**: Score upon successful execution.  
- Example: Bombing in *Wings over the Flanders* → +2 points immediately.  
- After success, exiting from own side no longer gives enemy points.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I fire through my own plane?** No. Firing blocked if path crosses any plane (friendly or enemy).  
- **What if I run out of damage cards?**  
  - Reshuffle used cards of same letter.  
  - If insufficient, use paper to track damage secretly.  
- **Two-seater firing both arcs:** Yes, but each arc requires separate target and valid firing cone.  
- **Jammed guns:** Affects **firing plane**. Discard one jam counter per maneuver; cannot fire during that phase.  
  - Two-seaters: only jammed arc is disabled.  
- **Multiple special damages:** All apply unless same type — then only latest counts.  
- **Tailing broken mid-turn?** Only checked at start of turn and before 2nd maneuver. Once initiated, partial movement doesn’t break it unless planes overlap or exit.  
- **Engine damage + fire?** Yes, both apply. Must stall each turn and draw fire cards.  
- **Can a stalled plane perform Immelmann?** Only if stall is the required maneuver (short arrow + $\diamond$), and straight precedes/follows as needed.
