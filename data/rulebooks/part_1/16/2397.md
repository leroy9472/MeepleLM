## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Backgammon is one of the oldest known board games, played by two players using dice to move pieces around a board. The objective is to be the first to remove (bear off) all 15 of one’s stones from the board. Victory occurs when a player completes bearing off before their opponent. The game is often played in matches, with the overall winner being the first to reach a predetermined number of points.

### 2. Components  
- One Backgammon board, featuring 24 triangular points arranged in a horseshoe shape  
- 15 white stones (checkers)  
- 15 red or blue stones (checkers) — color depends on set; red or blue are functionally identical  
- Two standard six-sided dice  
- One doubling cube (numbered 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64), or a doubling track with a red counter and marked positions (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64)  

Note: Some sets use a doubling track instead of a cube. The red counter starts at "1" and moves to indicate the current stake multiplier.

### 3. Setup  
- The board has 24 points, numbered 1 to 24. Points 1–6 are the player’s home board; 7–12 are the outer board. The opponent’s home board is points 19–24.  
- Each player places 15 stones as follows:  
  - White:  
    - 2 stones on point 24  
    - 5 stones on point 13  
    - 3 stones on point 8  
    - 5 stones on point 6  
  - Red/Blue:  
    - 2 stones on point 1  
    - 5 stones on point 12  
    - 3 stones on point 17  
    - 5 stones on point 19  

Movement direction:  
- White moves from point 24 toward point 1 (clockwise)  
- Red/Blue moves from point 1 toward point 24 (counterclockwise)  

The board is divided by a central bar where hit stones are placed.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Starting the Game**:  
   - Each player rolls one die.  
   - The player with the higher number goes first and uses both dice values for their first move.  
   - Dice must land flat on the right-hand side of the board.  
   - Players alternate turns thereafter.

2. **On a Turn**:  
   - Roll two dice.  
   - Move stones according to the numbers shown.  
   - Use both dice if possible, following compulsory move rules.  
   - After movement, the turn ends and play passes to the opponent.

3. **Movement Rules**:  
   - A roll of 6 and 3 requires moving one stone 6 points and another (or the same) 3 points.  
   - The same stone may be moved twice, but moves must be distinct (e.g., 6 then 3, or 3 then 6).  
   - Doubles (e.g., 5-5): the player uses each die twice, allowing up to four moves of that number.  
   - All possible die values must be played if legally possible.

4. **Compulsory Move Rules**:  
   - If both dice can be played, the player must do so.  
   - If only one die can be played, the higher number must be used.  
   - If playing one die enables a move for the other, that sequence is mandatory.  
     - Example: Rolling 6-3, if only moving the 6 with a specific stone allows a subsequent 3-move, that path must be taken.

5. **Landing on Points**:  
   - A stone may land on:  
     - An empty point  
     - A point occupied only by own stones  
     - A point with exactly one opposing stone (a "blot")  
   - Landing on a blot "hits" it: the opposing stone is moved to the bar.  
   - A stone may not land on a point occupied by two or more opposing stones.

6. **Entering from the Bar**:  
   - Any stone on the bar must re-enter the opponent’s home board before other moves are made.  
   - A die roll of *n* allows entry on the opponent’s *n*-point (e.g., rolling a 4 allows entry on point 4 for White vs. Red).  
   - If no entry is possible, the turn ends.

7. **Bearing Off**:  
   - Begins only when all 15 stones are in the player’s home board (points 1–6 for White, 19–24 for Red/Blue).  
   - A die roll of *n* allows bearing off a stone from point *n*.  
   - If no stone is on point *n*, but stones exist on higher-numbered points, the die must be used to move a stone from the highest occupied point.  
     - Example: Roll 6-5, no stone on 6, but two on 5 → both 6 and 5 are used to bear off from 5.  
   - A player may use a lower die to move a stone forward within the home board before bearing off, even if it "wastes" part of a higher die.  
     - Example: One stone on 6, roll 6-1 → move stone to 5 with 1, then bear off with 6.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Hitting and Re-entering**: A blot (single stone) is vulnerable. When hit, it goes to the bar and must re-enter before other moves.  
- **Blocking**: Points with two or more stones form a "prime" and block opponent movement.  
- **Doubling Cube / Doubling Track**:  
  - At the start, the cube is at 1 (or counter at '1').  
  - Before rolling, a player may propose doubling the stakes.  
  - Opponent must either:  
    - **Take**: accept the new stakes and gain the right to redouble later  
    - **Drop**: concede the game and lose at current stake value  
  - The red counter moves to the next power of two (e.g., 1 → 2 → 4 → 8...) on the taker’s side.  
  - Only the player who last accepted a double may offer the next redouble.  
  - Example: Counter at 4 on Red’s side → Red doubles → White takes → counter moves to 8 on White’s side.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Single Game**: Winner earns 1 point × current doubling value.  
- **Gammon**: If the loser has not borne off any stones, they lose **2 ×** the doubling value.  
- **Backgammon**: If the loser has not borne off any stones **and** has stones on the bar or in the winner’s home board, they lose **3 ×** the doubling value.  
- **Dropping a Double**: If a player drops a double when the cube is at *n*, they lose *n* points.  

Example: Cube at 8 → player redoubles to 16 → opponent drops → opponent loses 8 points.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move fewer than the full die value?**  
  No. Moves must use the full die value unless bearing off and no higher points are occupied.

- **Can I pass my turn if I can only move one die?**  
  No. If you can move at least one die, you must play it (the higher if only one is playable).

- **What if re-entering from the bar blocks all movement?**  
  You must still re-enter if possible. If no legal entry exists, turn ends.

- **Can I bear off while I have stones on the bar?**  
  No. All stones must be in your home board before bearing off begins.

- **Does the doubling cube affect gammon/backgammon values?**  
  Yes. Gammon = 2× cube value, Backgammon = 3× cube value.

- **Can I use both dice to move one stone during bearing off?**  
  Only if each move is legal. For example, if you roll 3-3 and have one stone on point 4, you can move it to 1 (using two 3s), then bear it off with another 3 — if allowed by available moves.
