## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Autosaurs are automated players designed to simulate AI opponents in EVO (1st edition). They compete for territory and genes using deterministic algorithms. The objective for Autosaurs is the same as for human players: accumulate the most Mutation Points by the end of the game, primarily through surviving dinosaurs and successful evolution.

2. Components  
No additional components are required to use Autosaurs. They utilize the standard EVO game components:  
- Dino markers (in a distinct color)  
- Mutation Point (MP) track  
- Gene tokens (tails, horns, legs, eggs, fur, parasol, mutant, card)  
- Climate and meteor tracks  
- Die  

Autosaurs use only tail and horn genes during gameplay. All other genes ("general" genes) are ignored, including those pre-printed on their player board.

3. Setup  
- Place the Autosaur’s starting dino in a space adjacent to a star (as with human players).  
- The Autosaur starts with **two** dinos on the map. The second dino is placed in a beach space adjacent to the starting space, following Birth rules.  
- Set the Autosaur’s Mutation Point marker to 10 (standard starting value).  
- Shuffle gene tokens into the bag as normal.  
- Autosaurs do not receive event cards and cannot play or be affected by cards that modify "general" genes.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Autosaurs follow the standard EVO turn phases with modifications in Movement, Birth, Survival, and Evolution.

Phases proceed in order:  
1. Initiative  
2. Climate  
3. Movement  
4. Birth  
5. Survival  
6. Meteor  
7. Evolution  

5. Core Mechanics  

**Phase 3: Movement**  
- Autosaur dinos **do not move** during this phase.  
- They **can defend** in combat if attacked but **never initiate attacks** in this phase.  
- However, they **can attack during Birth phase** if placing a dino in an occupied space.

**Phase 4: Birth**  
Autosaurs birth new dinos according to the following algorithm:  
- Normally, birth one dino in **each non-deadly space adjacent to two of their adult dinos**.  
- If no such space exists:  
  - Birth one dino in a **non-deadly space adjacent to one adult dino**.  
- If no adjacent non-deadly spaces:  
  - Birth one dino in a **non-deadly space closest to the starting space**.  
- If no adult dinos remain:  
  - Birth one dino in a **non-deadly space closest to the starting space**.

**Space Selection Preferences (in order):**  
1. Empty space over one with an enemy dino.  
2. Mild climate over hot or cold.  
3. Closer to Autosaur’s starting space.  
4. Closer to the center of the map.  
5. Farther from enemy dinos.  
6. Closer to enemy dinos with fewer horns.  
7. Maximally inconvenient to players with more Mutation Points.

**Combat during Birth:**  
- If a birth space is occupied by an enemy dino, combat is triggered as if the Autosaur dino moved in.  
- The Autosaur will only attempt to claim each birth space **once per turn**.  
- The Autosaur **will not attempt** to birth in a space occupied by an enemy with **2 or more horns than its own dino**.

**Phase 5: Survival**  
- All dinos in deadly climates (very hot or very cold) are removed.  
- Additionally, **isolated Autosaur dinos are removed**, even in non-deadly spaces.  
- A dino is isolated if **not adjacent to at least one other Autosaur dino**.  
- Non-deadly spaces: mild, hot, or cold (i.e., not very hot or very cold).

**Phase 6: Evolution (Auction Rules)**  
- Autosaurs bid using a die roll and decision algorithm.

**Starting Bid:**  
- Roll a die; bid on the gene with the **lowest required bid** (including 0).  
- In case of tie, choose the gene in the **lowest-numbered row**.

**When Outbid:**  
- Roll a die and apply modifiers:  
  - +1 if Autosaur has more MPs than any other player.  
  - -1 if Autosaur is solely last in MPs.  
  - -1 if a same-type gene (tail/horn/general) is available for lower bid.  
  - +1 if cost of new bid is 3 or more (optional clarification: no modifier based on source).  
- If modified roll ≥ 5: **increase bid** on current gene.  
- If modified roll ≤ 4: **move bid** to another row, following these preferences:  
  1. Gene requiring a lower bid.  
  2. Same gene type (tail, horn, general).  
  3. Cheapest available gene.  
  4. Row closest to current row.  
  5. Row closest to top of track.

**Passing Rule:**  
- If fewer genes than players remain and the **unmodified die roll is less than the cost of the cheapest gene**, the Autosaur passes.

**Gene Assignment:**  
- Genes up for auction must be assigned to rows **randomly** at the start of the phase.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when the meteor strikes (determined by meteor track).  
- Final score = Mutation Points on track.  
- In case of tie: most dinos on board wins; further ties are shared.  
- Autosaurs score Mutation Points equal to number of their surviving dinos after Survival phase.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can Autosaurs gain card or mutant genes?**  
  A: They can win them in auction, but they are ignored ("general" genes). They do not draw cards or gain benefits from mutant genes.

- **Q: Do Autosaurs participate in initiative order?**  
  A: Yes. Their tail length determines position. Ties broken by number of dinos, then die roll.

- **Q: What happens if no non-deadly space is available for birth?**  
  A: No birth occurs.

- **Q: Can an Autosaur dino attack during Birth if it moves into a space with a human dino?**  
  A: Yes. Combat is triggered normally.

- **Q: Are Autosaurs affected by event cards?**  
  A: Yes, unless the card only affects "general" genes.

- **Q: Do Autosaurs use movement points from leg genes?**  
  A: No. They do not move in Movement phase. Leg genes are ignored.
