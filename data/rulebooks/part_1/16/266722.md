## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
As warlords during Japan’s Sengoku (Warring States) Period, players vie for control over 11 castles scattered across the map. The goal is to achieve the highest score by capturing Large and Small Castle Tokens during the War Phase. Victory is determined by the total value of captured Castle Tokens, with Sword Tokens used as tiebreakers.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the map in the center.  
2. Shuffle Large Castle Tokens face-down and place one on each circular space; flip face-up.  
3. Shuffle Tactic Cards and place face-up beside the map:  
   - 2 players: 3 cards  
   - 3 players: 4 cards  
   - 4 players: 5 cards  
   (Remaining cards are unused.)  
4. Place Small Castle Tokens, Sword Tokens, and Reinforcement Cubes in a shared supply.  
   - In 2-player game: remove Sword Tokens with 3 and 4 swords; remove all Small Castle Tokens.  
   - In 3-player game: remove Sword Token with 4 swords.  
5. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
   - 18 Soldier Cubes (Stock)  
   - 1 Player Marker  
6. Determine starting player (e.g., most recent castle visitor); give them the 3 dice.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in two phases:  

#### I. Deployment Phase (Turn-based, clockwise)  
On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions **before rolling dice**:  

**Option 1: Deploy Soldiers**  
- Roll all 3 dice.  
- May reroll all 3 dice **once per turn** (cannot reroll fewer than 3).  
- Divide dice into:  
  - **2 Dice**: Sum determines target Area (match sum to Large Castle Token value).  
  - **1 Die**: Number of Soldier Cubes to deploy = die value ÷ 2, **rounded up**.  
    (Example: roll 5 → deploy 3 cubes; roll 2 → deploy 1 cube)  
- Deploy cubes to the Area matching the 2-dice sum.  
  - If deploying to Shuri Castle (Okinawa), place cubes around the island.  
- Must deploy full number unless Stock is exhausted.  
- Cubes may be placed in empty, friendly, or contested Areas.  
- Group cubes by player in each Area.  

**After placing cubes**:  
- If this was your last cube, take the highest-value Sword Token available.  
- Your turns are skipped for the rest of the phase.  

**Option 2: Use a Tactic Card**  
- Choose any face-up Tactic Card from the Display.  
- Must be able to **fully execute** the action to select it.  
- Place card in front of you and resolve effect immediately.  
- Tactic Cards can only be used **once per game per player**.  
- **Once any player has placed all their Soldier Cubes, no further Tactic Cards may be used.**  

#### End of Deployment Phase  
- Phase ends when all players have placed all Soldier Cubes.  
- Remaining Tactic Cards are discarded.  

#### II. War Phase (Simultaneous resolution by Area)  
Resolve Areas in ascending order of Large Castle Token value (2 → 12). For each Area:  

**① Determine the Winner**  
- Total strength = Soldier Cubes + Reinforcement Cubes in the Area.  
- Player with highest strength wins; second-highest is runner-up.  
- Tiebreaker: higher Sword Token.  

**② Claim Castle Tokens**  
- Winner takes the Large Castle Token.  
- In 3- or 4-player games: runner-up takes a Small Castle Token = half the Large Token’s value, **rounded down**.  
- If only one player occupies the Area: they win Large Token; no Small Token awarded.  
- If no units in Area: remove Large Castle Token (no one claims it).  

**③ Send Out Reinforcements**  
- Winner places Reinforcement Cubes in **adjacent Areas** that:  
  - Still have a Large Castle Token present  
  - Contain at least one of their Soldier Cubes  
- Number per eligible adjacent Area:  
  - 2-player game: 1 Reinforcement Cube  
  - 3- or 4-player game: 2 Reinforcement Cubes  
- Place Reinforcements adjacent to your Soldier Cubes; keep separate.  
- If supply runs out, reuse Reinforcements from already-resolved Areas.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Tactic Cards (12 total; one-time use)  
1. **Scout**: Move 1 of your Soldiers to an adjacent Area.  
2. **Over the Mountain**: Move 2 of your Soldiers from the same Area to an adjacent Area **connected by land**.  
3. **Marine**: Move 2 of your Soldiers from the same Area to an adjacent Area **connected by sea**.  
4. **Sub Squad**: Move half your Soldiers (rounded down) from one Area to an adjacent Area. (Requires ≥2 Soldiers.)  
5. **Ninja**: Move 1 of your Soldiers to **any Area where you have at least 1 Soldier**.  
6. **Entering Kyo**: Move **any number** of your Soldiers from **one or more Areas adjacent to Kyo (京)** into Kyo.  
7. **Support**: Place 1 Soldier from your Stock into an Area where you already have at least 1 Soldier.  
8. **Rebel**: Replace 1 enemy Soldier with 1 of your own from Stock. Return enemy to their Stock.  
9. **Exile**: From an Area where you have Soldiers, move 1 enemy Soldier to an adjacent Area.  
10. **Prisoner**: Move 1 enemy Soldier from any Area to an adjacent Area where you have Soldiers.  
11. **Decoy**: From the **same Area**, move 1 of your Soldiers and 2 of an opponent’s Soldiers to the **same adjacent Area**.  
12. **Retreat**: Return 2 of your Soldiers from anywhere on the map to your Stock. (Can be from multiple Areas.)  

> **Note (Errata)**: Earlier versions listed "3" for Retreat; corrected to **2** in official errata.

#### Daimyo Cards (Advanced Rules – Optional)  
- During Setup: Add your Daimyo meeple to your Stock; remove 2 of your Soldiers (now 16 total).  
- Daimyo is placed like a Soldier during Deployment.  
- During War Phase: Daimyo counts as **2 strength**; otherwise treated as a Soldier.  
- Daimyo Cards are **one-time use**, activated during Deployment Phase (instead of Deploy or Tactic).  
- Card effects specifying “Soldier” do **not** apply to Daimyo.  

**Daimyo Cards**:  
- **Uesugi Kenshin**: From your Daimyo’s Area, move up to 3 of your Soldiers to adjacent land Areas.  
- **Oda Nobunaga**: Move your Daimyo to an adjacent Area; may bring 1 Soldier with you.  
- **Chosokabe Motochika**: From your Daimyo’s Area, move up to 3 units (Soldiers or Daimyo) to adjacent sea-connected Areas.  
- **Takeda Shingen**: From your Daimyo’s Area, move up to 3 opponent Soldiers to adjacent Areas.  
- **Mori Motonari**: Place 1 Soldier from Stock to an Area adjacent to your Daimyo (up to 3 times, 1 per Area).  
- **Otomo Sōrin**: In up to 2 different Areas adjacent to your Daimyo, replace 1 enemy Soldier with 1 of your own (return enemy to Stock).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- After resolving all 11 Areas, players sum:  
  - Values of all Large Castle Tokens captured  
  - Values of all Small Castle Tokens captured (only in 3/4-player games)  
- Player with highest total wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with highest Sword Token wins.  
- If still tied, no further tiebreakers specified.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use a Tactic Card after rolling dice?**  
  No. Must choose action **before** rolling.  

- **Can I partially use a Tactic Card?**  
  No. Must be able to fully execute the action (e.g., must have 2 Soldiers to use *Over the Mountain*).  

- **When does the Deployment Phase end?**  
  When all players have placed all their Soldier Cubes.  

- **Can I use Tactic Cards after someone finishes?**  
  No. Once any player places their last cube, Tactic Cards are locked.  

- **Do Reinforcements count toward strength in later Areas?**  
  Yes. Reinforcements placed during resolution of lower-value Areas count in higher-value Areas.  

- **Can Reinforcements be placed in an Area without a Large Castle Token?**  
  No. Only in Areas that still have their Large Castle Token.  

- **Can I use my own returned Soldiers (e.g., from Retreat)?**  
  Yes. Soldiers returned to Stock can be redeployed normally.  

- **Does “adjacent” include sea-connected Areas?**  
  Yes. Thick lines on map indicate adjacency, even across sea.  

- **Can Daimyo be targeted by cards affecting Soldiers?**  
  No. Daimyo are not considered Soldiers for card effects.  

- **Can I place Reinforcements in an Area I just won?**  
  No. Reinforcements go to **adjacent** Areas, not the one just resolved.
