## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Wrongfully imprisoned in The Dark Castle, players take on the roles of prisoners attempting to escape its horrors. The castle is filled with dangers—traps, monsters, and psychological trials—each represented by a chapter card.  

**Objective:** Work cooperatively to overcome all 15 chapter cards and defeat the final boss. If all players survive this journey, they win. If any character dies during the game, the game ends immediately and all players lose.

### 3. Setup  

#### I) Create the Castle  
1. Shuffle the 45 Chapter Cards and deal **15 face-down** to form the Castle Deck.  
2. Shuffle the 3 Boss Cards and place **1 randomly** face-down underneath the Castle Deck (it will be the final card).  
3. Place the **Start Card** on top of the deck, image side up.  
4. Shuffle the **Item Deck** and place it face-down to the right of the Castle Deck.  
5. Place the **Chapter Dice** in a pool above the Castle Deck.

#### II) Choose Characters  
1. Lay out all 6 Character Cards and their corresponding Character Dice.  
2. Each player selects one character.  
3. Take the matching Character Dice and place the Character Card face-up in front of you.  
   - Characters have fixed values in **Might**, **Cunning**, and **Wisdom** (shown on card).  
   - Tip: A balanced team increases chances of success.

#### III) Set Health Points  
Each player starts with HP based on player count:  
- 1 or 2 players: **18 HP each**  
- 3 players: **14 HP each**  
- 4 players: **12 HP each**  
Track HP using the scorepad. Characters cannot exceed starting HP at any time.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
There is **no turn order**. Instead:  
1. The group decides which player will turn the next Chapter Card.  
2. That player reveals the top card of the Castle Deck by placing it **face-up to the left** of the deck (like turning a book page).  
3. Read the **italicized flavor text aloud** to set the scene.  
4. Follow the instructions on the card. This may involve:  
   - Making choices  
   - Rolling dice  
   - Using items  
   - Entering combat  
5. Complete the challenge.  
6. If the group survives, choose a player to turn the next card.  
7. Repeat until:  
   - The Boss is defeated → **All players win**  
   - Any character dies → **Game ends in loss**

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Item Cards  
- **Drawing Items:** When instructed to draw items, reveal them face-up. Distribute among players as a group decision.  
- **Carrying Limit:** Each character can carry **up to 2 items**, one in each hand.  
  - **Two-handed items** occupy both hands; no other items can be held.  
- **Trading Items:**  
  - Only allowed **after completing a chapter** or **during item draws**.  
  - Cannot trade during a chapter’s events or combat.  
  - Players may temporarily drop items to trade or use them, then redistribute.  
  - Unwanted items go to a discard pile beside the Item Deck.  
- **Using Items:**  
  - Can be used **at any time**, unless the card states otherwise.  
  - Some items require discarding after use; others can be kept.  
  - Using an item during a single-attempt roll (e.g., rolling to pass a test) still counts as **one attempt**.

#### Combat  
Combat occurs when a chapter card instructs "Begin combat..."

**Before Combat:**  
- Place Chapter Dice beneath the Chapter Card as shown at the bottom of the card.  
- If the card shows the **"per-player" symbol** (dice with number of players), roll **1 Chapter Die per player** and add them to the row.  
- These dice represent the enemy’s defenses. Remove them to win.

**Combat Rounds (repeat until enemy is defeated or a player dies):**  

**1) Attack Phase**  
- All **participating** players roll their **Character Dice**.  
- Resolve attacks **one at a time**, in any order the group chooses.  
- A **match** between a player’s die result and a Chapter Die removes that Chapter Die.  
- **Double result (e.g., two Might)**:  
  - Counts as **two hits** of that trait → remove two matching dice.  
  - Also counts as a **BLOCK** (defensive bonus).  
- Some items or abilities may modify rolls.

**2) Defend Phase**  
- If **any Chapter Dice remain**, the enemy attacks.  
- **Attack value is always 2 damage.**  
- Any participating player who **did not roll a DOUBLE (BLOCK)** takes **2 damage**.  
- Players who **BLOCKED** take no damage.  
- Resting players take no damage and do not participate.

**Resting Mechanic:**  
- At the **start of any combat round**, **one player** may choose to **rest**.  
  - Does not roll dice  
  - Cannot use items  
  - Does not take damage  
  - Gains **1 HP** for that round  
- Can rejoin combat in any future round.  
- Only one player may rest per round, but different players can rest in different rounds.

**Defeating the Enemy:**  
- If all Chapter Dice are removed **after the Attack Phase**, the enemy is defeated.  
- The enemy **does not counterattack** in that round.  
- Proceed to **After Combat**.

**After Combat:**  
- Draw **1 Item Card** (as a group).  
- Choose which player turns the next Chapter Card.  
- Continue gameplay.

**Combat Specials:**  
- Some enemies have special rules (e.g., “Roll removed dice; if WISDOM, return it”).  
- These override standard rules and must be followed.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

**Win Condition:**  
- Successfully complete all Chapter Cards and defeat the **Boss**.  
- All players must be **alive** at the end.  
- Victory! Reveal the **Victory! Card** (implied from components).

**Loss Condition:**  
- If **any player reaches 0 HP or below**, they die.  
- The game ends **immediately**.  
- All players lose.

**No individual scoring** — it’s fully cooperative. Win or lose together.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I use multiple items in one round?**  
A: Yes, unless a card restricts timing. Use them at any point unless specified.

**Q: Can I rest in every round of combat?**  
A: No — only **one player** may rest **per round**, but different players can rest in different rounds.

**Q: What happens to leftover items when we can’t carry them?**  
A: They are **left behind** and placed in the **discard pile** beside the Item Deck.

**Q: Do doubles count as two hits even if only one matching die is available?**  
A: No. You can only remove dice that exist. If only one Might die is present and you roll double Might, you remove one die (maximum available), and still gain the BLOCK.

**Q: Can I use an item after rolling dice in combat?**  
A: Yes — as long as it’s before the Defend Phase, and the item allows it.

**Q: How does solo play work?**  
A: Play with **two characters**. Make all decisions and rolls yourself.  
- Decide **which character** turns each card **before revealing it** — “you” effects apply only to that character.  
- Any “per player” instruction becomes “per character.”

**Q: Can I exceed my starting HP?**  
A: No. Maximum HP is always your starting value. Healing beyond it has no effect.
