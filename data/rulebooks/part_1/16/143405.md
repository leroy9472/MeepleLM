## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Grand Forest of the Oniverse is under attack by the Ravage, a fiery entity summoning an army of fire Elementals to burn the forest to ash. As the guardian of the forest, you must stop the Ravage’s advance, protect the forest’s vitality, and ultimately restore it to full health.

**Game Objective**:  
- Prevent the forest’s vitality from dropping to zero (by flipping all Edge cards to Desolated side) — if this happens, you lose immediately.  
- After the Final Assault, ensure all 12 Edge cards are Bloom side up — this is achieved by having enough Tree vitality to flip the remaining Desolated cards.  
- If all Edge cards are Bloom side up at the end, you win.
