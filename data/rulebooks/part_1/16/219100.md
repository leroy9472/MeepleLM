### 1. Lore & Objective
Players take on the roles of officers aboard a German Type VIIC U-boat during World War II. The goal is to fulfill mission objectives and sink enemy shipping to earn Renown, a victory point metric. Success is evaluated at mission end with rankings from S (superb) to F (mission failed). Players win or lose as a crew.

### 2. Components
- 3D U-boat model with 8 sections
- Hull section cards
- Four player panels (Captain, First Officer, Navigator, Chief Engineer)
- Crew tiles with sailor figures (4 per player, color-coded)
- Player aids and role-specific tools:
  - Attack Disk (Navigator)
  - Distance ruler, 360° protractor, Strategic Map
  - Tactical Map with markers (U-boat, merchant, escort, etc.)
  - Enigma code sheet, Identification sheet
- Tokens:
  - Activation, observation, technical condition, environmental condition
  - Supply tokens (wire, fire extinguisher, rebreathers, water pump, light bulbs)
  - Toolbox markers (2), flooded section token, KIA tokens
  - Medical supply tokens, medkit tokens
  - Cigarette tokens (2 per player)
  - Provision tokens (food types)
  - Crew tokens (16, for random selection)
- Cards:
  - Morale cards (3 decks)
  - Event cards
  - Wound cards (4 decks: burns, electric shock, poisoning, gunshot)
  - Captain’s cards
  - Chief Engineer’s tool cards
- Technical Puzzle (16 pieces)
- Captain’s Log Chart

### 3. Setup
1. **Choose Roles**: Assign Captain, First Officer, Navigator, Chief Engineer. Fewer players take multiple roles.
2. **Prepare Components**:
   - Assemble 3D U-boat and place section cards.
   - Position player panels.
   - Distribute role-specific components (e.g., Navigator gets Attack Disk, First Officer gets app device).
   - Shuffle and place card decks.
   - Place tokens:
     - Crew tokens in cloth bag.
     - Provision tokens shuffled into Food Supply; draw 6 to form pyramid.
     - Medical supply tokens on medkit space (add medkit tokens for linked missions).
     - Toolboxes in sections 2 and 4; supplies placed in sections 1–6 (1 per section).
   - Place sailor figures per starting setup: Sections 1–4, 8.
3. **Choose Game Mode & Difficulty**:
   - Select mode: Single Mission, Linked Mission, or Campaign.
   - Set difficulty per role via app.
4. **Read Mission Briefing** in app and start mission.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- **Real-time, app-driven**: No player turns. App drives events and timing.
- **Captain issues orders** after paying on Order Track.
- **Core Sequence**:
  1. Pay for order (move order token right on Order Track).
  2. Confirm sailors in position.
  3. Activate sailors.
  4. Carry out order (in app if required).
- **Watch changes** at 0600, 1200, 1800, 0000: Adjust Order Track, discard activation tokens, flip crew tiles.
- **Mobilization**: Move sailors between sections. Not an order, but required before most actions.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Order Track & Morale Track**:
  - Order Track (9 spaces): Pay here first. Resets left at watch change (3–5 spaces based on difficulty).
  - Morale Track (12 spaces): Used when Order Track is full. Moving right decreases morale; left increases.
  - Morale decreases: KIA (–2), environmental condition (–1), paying on Morale Track.
  - Morale increases: Sinking enemy (+3), repairing environmental condition (+2), eating good meal (+1), Captain’s cards.
  - Draw morale card when token enters X, VIII, VI, IV, II, or end space.
- **Activation**:
  - Each sailor has 3 activation spaces.
  - Activating a sailor places an activation token in an empty space.
  - Sailors without required specialization take 2 activation tokens.
  - Watch change: discard one activation token per sailor.
- **Busy Sailors**:
  - Observation and repair use special tokens (double-sided).
  - Busy sailors cannot be activated again unless the order allows multiple activations.
  - Moving a busy sailor stops the order.
- **Crew Damage**:
  - Resolved when:
    - Environmental condition (fire, electrical hazard, toxic gas) placed in occupied section.
    - Sailors move into/through hazardous section.
    - Watch change or mobilization in hazardous section.
    - Enemy attack.
  - Captain draws one crew token per sailor in affected section.
  - Matched tokens = wounded sailors. First Officer draws wound card (type based on hazard).
  - Wound cards require placing wound/fatigue/activation tokens.
  - Second wound token = KIA.
- **KIA**:
  - Place KIA token, remove figure, return to crew tile.
  - Decrease morale by 2.
  - Counterpart may return at next watch change if alive.
- **Cigarettes**:
  - Discard once per watch.
  - Up to 4 sailors in sections 7–8 discard one activation token each.
  - Not an order; cost-free.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Renown scored by**:
  - Completing primary and secondary mission objectives.
  - Sinking enemy shipping (GRT-based).
- **Mission ends when**:
  - Time runs out.
  - U-boat returns to base (via app).
  - U-boat is destroyed (rammed, grounded, sunk by damage, or all crew killed).
- **Final Evaluation**:
  - App calculates total Renown.
  - Result: S (superb), A (excellent), B (good), C (decent), D (unsatisfactory), E (bad), F (mission failed).
- **Exhausted Crew**:
  - Morale Track token reaches end → crew exhausted.
  - No orders can be paid on Morale Track.
  - New environmental condition or hull breach → “All hands lost” (game over).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hull Breach**:
  - Requires 5 sailors in breached section.
  - Chief Engineer solves Technical Puzzle (3 adjacent sections) before timer ends.
  - Failure: Flood section, KIA all inside, lose supplies.
  - Second flooded section → U-boat sinks.
- **Flooded Sections**:
  - Inaccessible; block movement.
  - Bypass only when surfaced: activated sailor uses torpedo hatches (sections 1 and 6).
- **Environmental Conditions**:
  - Fire, electrical hazard, toxic gas: cause crew damage, require supplies to repair.
  - Toxic gas: removed only by surfacing; rebreathers prevent crew damage.
  - Lighting failure: +1 activation needed in section; non-lethal.
- **Repairs**:
  - Technical conditions: require sailors, possibly tool cards.
  - Environmental conditions: 1 sailor + correct supply.
  - Repair paused if crew size drops; resumes without new order.
- **Tool Cards**:
  - +1/+2 cards: boost repair crew size; require qualified sailor; discarded after use.
  - ⊙ cards: modify activation; reusable; stay in toolbox.
- **Timing Conflicts**:
  - Resolve pending cards (event, morale, wound) when Captain pauses.
  - Captain decides resolution order if conflict.
