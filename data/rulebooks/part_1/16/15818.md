## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Pickomino* (also known as *Heckmeck*), players take on the role of chickens competing to collect the tastiest barbecued worms at Johnny Rooster Roaster’s grill. The objective is to collect tiles representing worm servings. The game ends when all tiles are acquired; the player with the most worms on their collected tiles wins. In case of a tie, the player with the highest-value tile wins.

---

### 2. Components  
- 16 worm tiles numbered from 21 to 36 (each showing a value and 1–3 worm symbols)  
- 8 dice: each die shows values 1–5 and one worm (worm = value 5)  
- Optional *Extrawurm* expansion components:  
  - Two special tiles: 11 and 13  
  - Five Specialist tokens: Canned Worm, Sitting Hen, Raven, Weasel, Golden Die  
  - Bratwurm tokens (worth 1 point each)

---

### 3. Setup  
- Place the 16 worm tiles side-by-side in ascending order (21 to 36) in the center of the table. This forms the "grill."  
- The youngest player begins. Play proceeds clockwise.  

*EXTRAWURM Setup (if used):*  
- Place the 11 and 13 tiles to the left of the main row.  
- Place all Specialist tokens near the board within reach.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, follow these steps:

1. **Roll all available dice** (start with all 8).  
2. **Keep all dice showing one chosen value**  
   - You must select a value not yet set aside this turn.  
   - Keep all dice showing that value (e.g., all 4s or all worms).  
   - If no new value can be selected, the turn fails immediately.  
3. **Choose: Stop or Roll Again**  
   - If you still have unrolled dice, you may:  
     a) **Roll remaining dice again**, repeating step 2.  
     b) **Stop** and attempt to claim a tile.  
   - If you have no dice left to roll, your turn ends automatically.

To **claim a tile**, your total dice value must:  
- Be **equal to or greater than** a tile on the grill, **AND**  
- Include **at least one worm die**.

Alternatively, you may **steal** another player’s topmost tile if your total **exactly matches** its value and you have a worm.

Place the acquired tile face-up in front of you to form a stack. Only the topmost tile is visible and can be stolen.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Dice Values:** Numbers 1–5 count at face value. Worms count as 5 points.  
- **Set-Aside Rule:** Once you set aside a value (e.g., 3s), you cannot take that value again in the same turn.  
- **Failure Conditions:** A turn fails if:  
  - You roll only values you’ve already taken.  
  - You stop with no worm in your result.  
  - You stop with a total too low to claim any available tile.  
  - You run out of dice without meeting claim conditions.  
- **Failing to Take a Tile:**  
  - Return your **topmost tile** (if any) to the grill in its original position.  
  - Then, **turn over** the **highest-value tile currently on the grill**, removing it from play.  
  - Exception: If the returned tile was the highest, do **not** turn over another tile.

*EXTRAWURM Rules:*  
- **Tiles 11 & 13:** Can only be taken by rolling **exactly** that total with a worm. Cannot be stolen or returned.  
- **Specialists:**  
  - Gain a Specialist when you take or steal a tile showing one.  
  - You can only hold **one** Specialist at a time.  
  - Lose your current Specialist (return to lowest empty tile) if you fail a turn or acquire a second.  
- **Canned Worm:** Counts as a worm (5 points) **only if** it's your only worm.  
- **Sitting Hen:** On failure, lose the Hen instead of a tile (unless you have no tiles). Others steal the Hen, not your tile. Also blocks tile theft.  
- **Raven:** Gain a Bratwurm (from supply, then from a player). Do **not** take the Raven tile; place it on the lowest empty center tile.  
- **Weasel:** May re-roll your current dice **once per turn** after a roll.  
- **Golden Die:** Use as a **ninth die** for the turn.  
- **Bratwurms:** Gain 1 Bratwurm token when you set aside **two or more dice showing 1**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends **immediately** when the last tile is taken from the grill.  
- Players total the **number of worms** on all their collected tiles.  
- **Final Score = Total worms + Bratwurms (1 pt each).**  
- **Winner:** Player with the most worms.  
- **Tiebreaker:** Among tied players, the one with the **highest-value tile** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I stop without claiming a tile?**  
  No. If you can legally claim a tile (total ≥ a grill tile or = another player’s top tile, with a worm), you **must** take one.  
- **Can I steal my own tile?**  
  No. You cannot steal from yourself.  
- **What if the tile I want is covered?**  
  Only the topmost tile of a player’s stack is available for stealing.  
- **Can I take a lower tile if my total matches a higher one?**  
  Yes. If your total ≥ a grill tile, you may take that tile **or any lower-value tile** (if available).  
- **What if the highest tile is stolen?**  
  The next highest **on the grill** is turned over on a failure.  
- **Can I use Weasel after failing?**  
  No. Weasel can only be used during your turn before deciding to stop or fail.  
- **What happens to a Specialist if you lose your last tile?**  
  You still lose the Specialist if you fail the turn, regardless of tile count.
