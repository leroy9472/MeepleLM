## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Mission: Red Planet, players are leaders of rival mining corporations racing to colonize Mars and exploit its rich resources—Celerium, Sylvaniaite, and Ice. The planet’s surface is divided into 10 regions, each potentially holding valuable deposits. Through strategic deployment of astronauts via shuttles, players aim to dominate regions, fulfill secret objectives, and maximize their score by the end of the 10th turn. Victory is achieved by earning the most victory points from resource tokens, Discovery cards, and Bonus cards.

This variant, "Unique Abilities," introduces asymmetrical player powers. Each player assumes the role of a unique character with a special ability and a restricted crew of five character cards. These abilities add strategic depth and personalization, allowing for varied playstyles such as manipulation, sabotage, or mobility.

2. Components  
- 1 circular Mars board (10 regions: 8 outer, 2 central)  
- 20 destination tokens (shuttle destinations)  
- 14 face-down resource tokens (Celerium, Sylvaniaite, Ice)  
- 100 scoring tokens (in Celerium, Sylvaniaite, Ice types)  
- 24 Event cards:  
  - 14 Discovery cards (affect scoring or placement)  
  - 10 Bonus cards (secret objectives)  
- 34 Shuttle cards (with capacities of 1–3 astronauts)  
- 5 sets of 22 astronaut meeples (in 5 colors)  
- 5 sets of 9 character cards (in 5 colors)  
- 1 turn track (with marker)  
- 2 rocket pawns (one as first player marker)  
- 8 Abilities Reference Sheets (from variant rules, each with male/female art and unique ability)

3. Setup  
- Place Mars board and turn track (set to Turn 1) in center.  
- Shuffle 14 resource tokens and place them face down beside the board.  
- Place 20 destination tokens face up beside the board.  
- Each player chooses an Abilities Reference Sheet (8 total, one per player), selecting male or female side.  
- Each player takes:  
  - The 5 character cards listed as their "Crew"  
  - 2 Ice scoring tokens (round #1 type)  
  - 1 set of meeples and matching character cards  
- Shuffle Shuttle cards; draw face-up shuttles equal to player count.  
- Randomly assign one meeple from each player to each face-up shuttle card.  
- The player whose meeple is drawn first receives the first player rocket pawn.  
- Shuffle Event cards. Deal 3 Bonus cards to each player (2 in 5-player game).  
  - Each player keeps 1 Bonus card, discards the rest. Discarded Bonus cards are removed from the game.  
  - Remaining Event cards (Discovery and discarded Discovery cards) form the draw deck.  
- Discovery cards are played face down on outer Mars regions only (max 1 per region).

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn consists of 5 phases:

**Phase 1: Draw New Shuttles**  
- Replace any shuttles that launched last turn by drawing new ones.  
- If deck is empty, reshuffle discard pile.  
- (Skipped in Turn 1.)

**Phase 2: Choose Characters**  
- Each player selects one character from their hand (only their 5 Crew cards are available).  
- Played face down.  
- Special abilities may activate at beginning or end of this phase (see Core Mechanics).

**Phase 3: Boarding and Lift-Off**  
- Characters are called in order 1 to 9.  
- Players who played the current character reveal and resolve actions in clockwise order (starting with first player or next clockwise who played it).  
- If multiple players play the same character, resolve in clockwise order.  
- If no one plays a character, skip it.  
- Actions may include placing astronauts, moving, destroying, or launching shuttles.  
- After acting, the character card is set aside (cannot be reused until Recruiter is played).

**Phase 4: Landing**  
- All shuttles that launched this turn land on Mars.  
- Astronauts are placed in the region indicated by the shuttle’s destination token.  
- If landing in an unexplored region (no resource token), draw one at random and place it face up.  
- Pilot may have changed destination earlier.  
- Destination tokens from diverted shuttles return to supply.  
- Shuttle cards are discarded.  
- Special abilities may trigger during this phase (e.g., moving astronauts, eliminating others).

**Phase 5: End of Turn**  
- The last player to act takes the first player rocket pawn.  
- Advance turn marker by 1.  
- Scoring occurs at the end of Turns 5, 8, and 10.

5. Core Mechanics

  - 4 – Secret Agent: Place 1 astronaut in each of 2 different shuttles; launch an incomplete shuttle.  
  - 5 – Saboteur: Place 1 astronaut; destroy one unlaunched shuttle (meeples lost in space).

    Phase 2 (before choosing). Spend 2 score tokens to return one previously played character to your hand.  
  - **Guileful Genius (Crew: 1,2,3,7,9):**

    Phase 2 (before choosing). Spend 1 score token to look at a previously played Discovery card.  

- **Score Tokens as Currency:**  
  Special abilities cost 1 or 2 score tokens (any type: Ice, Celerium, Sylvaniaite).  
  Players start with 2 Ice tokens. Using abilities spends victory points. More tokens are earned through scoring.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Turn 5 Scoring:**  
  In each region, the player with the most astronauts receives 1 resource token. Tie → token stays on region.

  Add 2 resource tokens to each region. Majority player takes all tokens (2 or 3 if tied in Turn 5). Leftover tokens remain.  
- **Turn 10 (Final Scoring):**  
  - Reveal all Discovery cards.  
  - Add 3 resource tokens to each region. Majority player takes all tokens present (3 or more). Leftovers removed.

  - Score Bonus cards.  

**Discovery Card Effects (applied at Turn 10):**

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use my special ability more than once?**  
  Yes, if you have enough score tokens. Each use costs the listed amount.  
- **Can I use multiple special abilities in one game?**  
  No. Each player uses only the ability on their chosen Reference Sheet.  
- **What happens if I run out of score tokens?**  
  You can still earn more via scoring. Only way to spend them is via special abilities.  
- **Can the Explorer move astronauts before they land?**  
  No. Movement occurs after boarding phase, but astronauts must already be on Mars.  
- **Can I use the Pilot to change destination of a landed shuttle?**  
  No. Pilot can only change destination of shuttles on land or launched this turn (before landing).  
- **Can I use Guileful Genius to act before Recruiter retrieves cards?**  
  Yes. Guileful Genius allows acting out of turn order, even before lower-numbered characters.  
- **Can Major Mayhem eliminate his own astronaut?**  
  No. Ability specifies "another player’s astronaut."  
- **If a Discovery card causes resource change, do Bonus cards update?**  
  No. Bonus cards like "Celerium" or "Sylvanite" refer to token counts, not region types. Tokens are swapped to match new resource.
