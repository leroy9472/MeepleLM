### 1. Lore & Objective
The objective of the game is to accumulate the most money by strategically buying and selling shares across eight rounds, while managing donations to charity. Players influence market values using adjustment cards. The game features two key milestones: a mid-game donation payout after Round 4, and a final elimination and scoring after Round 8.

### 2. Components
- Share tokens (representing commodities such as wheat, coal, wood, and "o'hect" [likely a typo or codename])
- Market adjustment cards (with values, played from left and right racks)
- Charity board
- First Player Marker
- Money (currency for transactions and scoring)

### 3. Setup
- Each player receives starting money (amount not specified in source).
- Market adjustment card racks (left and right) are prepared (exact setup not detailed).
- The First Player Marker is given to the starting player.
- The charity board is placed in the center.
- The game lasts exactly 8 rounds.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of two steps, taken in turn order starting with the first player:

#### STEP 1: Share Transactions
- Each player may:
  - Buy up to 3 shares total (any combination of types, e.g., 2 wheat and 1 coal).
  - Sell up to 3 shares total.
  - Transactions can be mixed (buy and sell), but total actions cannot exceed 3 shares.
- Players **may not** buy shares with a cost of zero.
- After transactions, each player may place **up to 1 share**, face down, on the charity board (optional).

#### STEP 2: Market Adjustment
- Each player must:
  - Play 2 market adjustment cards:
    - One card from the **left-side rack**
    - One card from the **right-side rack**
  - One card is played for its **full value**, the other for **half value** (rounded down, if needed).
- These cards adjust market prices (exact mechanism not detailed, assumed from context).
- After all players complete adjustments, the round ends.

#### Round Milestones:
- **After Round 4**:
  - All players sell shares currently on the charity board.
  - Proceeds are placed on the charity board and **set aside** — they do not count toward final wealth.
  - Pass the First Player Marker to the left.
  - Begin Round 5.

- **After Round 8**:
  - All players sell shares on the charity board.
  - Players compare donation amounts (total money from sold charity shares).
  - The player with the **smallest donation is eliminated**.
  - Donated money is returned to the bank.
  - Remaining players sell all remaining shares.
  - The player with the **most money** wins.

- In all other rounds (not 4 or 8), simply pass the First Player Marker to the left and begin the next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Share Trading**: Players buy and sell shares each round based on market conditions.
- **Market Adjustment**: Players influence market values by playing cards from designated racks, using one at full value and one at half value.
- **Charity Donation**: Players may donate one share per round face down; these are sold at Round 4 and Round 8.
- **Donation-Based Elimination**: Lowest donor after Round 8 is eliminated before final scoring.
- **Turn Order**: Proceeds clockwise, starting with the first player; First Player Marker rotates left after each round.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- The game ends after Round 8.
- Sequence:
  1. Sell donated shares (from charity board) — record donation amounts.
  2. Compare donations — eliminate the player with the smallest total.
  3. Return all donated money to the bank.
  4. Sell all remaining shares held by players.
  5. The player with the **most money** wins.
- Money earned during Round 4 donation payout **does not count** toward final totals — it is set aside.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a player donate zero shares?**  
  Yes — placing a share on the charity board is optional. A player may donate 0.
- **What if multiple players tie for smallest donation after Round 8?**  
  Rule not specified — assumed all tied lowest donors are eliminated, but source does not clarify.
- **Are charity donations revealed when sold?**  
  Not specified — since shares are placed face down, donation values are likely only known when sold.
- **Can a player be eliminated due to zero donation?**  
  Yes, if their total donation is the lowest (or tied lowest).
- **What happens if a player cannot play two cards (e.g., no cards)?**  
  Not specified — assumed players always have cards to play.
