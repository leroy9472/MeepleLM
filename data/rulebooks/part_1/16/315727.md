## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the distant future, most stars have died. Only rare white dwarf stars remain—the Last Light in the universe. Players take on alien factions racing to control these dying stars by researching technologies, mining resources, building fleets, and harvesting light.  

**Objective:** Be the first to collect 20 or more light. At the end of any round where at least one player has 20+ light, the game ends and the player with the most light wins.

**Tiebreakers:**  
1. Most technology cards in play  
2. Most resources (if still tied)

2. Randomly assign planets and place them on the board as shown in setup diagrams (based on player count). Assign planetary ID tokens.

3. Shuffle planetary exploration tokens into two piles (common and rare), then assign face-down to planets. Shuffle and place deep space exploration tokens face-down on designated spots.

4. Place asteroids and colony ships as shown.

5. Each player places:
   - One small ship in their starting sector (colony ship area)
   - One extractor on a common resource space of their colony ship

6. Shuffle tech deck; deal 1 tech card to each player.

7. Players secretly choose 1 alien faction and 1 planetary achievement card to keep. Return others to the box.

8. Reveal alien factions.

9. Give first player token to the player who most recently looked at the stars.

10. For **2-player games only**:  
    - Introduce the non-player **Lumos** faction using an unused color.  
    - Place 2 small Lumos ships in the center sector.  
    - Add 2 more smallest available Lumos ships to the center each time the board rotates.  
    - Lumos ships go to destroyers’ graveyards when killed; return to box when released.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds as follows:

1. **Action Selection (Simultaneous):**  
   All players choose one action card from their hand and reveal it simultaneously.

2. **Action Resolution:**  
   - Most actions resolve simultaneously.  
   - **Command** resolves in turn order (first player clockwise).  
   - If conflict arises between same-numbered actions, lower-numbered action resolves first.  
   - If same action number, first player resolves first.

3. **End of Round:**  
   - After all actions are resolved, check if **all players have played Refresh**.  
   - If yes:  
     - Rotate board:  
       - Inner ring: +90° clockwise  
       - Outer ring: +45° clockwise  
     - Each player gains 1 light per ship in the center sector.  
     - Pass first player token clockwise.  
     - All players pick up their Refresh cards.  
   - Game ends if any player has ≥20 light.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions (One per turn)  

**1. Research**  
- Gain 1 light per 4 technology cards in play (round down).  
- Draw 3 tech cards, keep 2, discard 1 face-up.  
- **Manufacture Technologies:**  
  - Pay resource cost to play unresearched techs from hand.  
  - Civilization techs: Play near board; exhaust if required.

  - Ship mod techs: Slide under player board; give permanent upgrades (movement, shields, attack).  
    - Small: 1 mod  
    - Medium: 2 mods  
    - Large: 3 mods  

**2. Mine**  
- Gain 1 resource per extractor you control.  
- Resource type depends on planetary exploration token or colony ship icon.  
- **Control:** Planet has your extractor (enemy ships may be present).  
- **Blockaded:** If enemy ships are present → cannot gain light during Refresh, but can still mine.  

**3. Construct**  
- **Ships:** Pay cost on player board; place in home sector (colony ship sector).  
  - Can build from opponent’s graveyard by paying cost to that player.  
- **Extractor:**  
  - Build one extractor.  
  - Must be:  
    - On your colony ship (unoccupied space), OR  
    - On a planet with only your ships and no existing extractor.  
  - No cost.

- Choose 2 of the following (may repeat):  
  - Gain 1 common resource  
  - Gain 1 uncommon resource  
  - Gain 1 rare resource  
  - Convert 2 common → 1 uncommon  
  - Convert 2 uncommon → 1 rare  
  - Convert 1 rare → 2 uncommon  
  - Convert 1 uncommon → 2 common  
- Then, choose one other player to gain 1 light from supply.  

**5. Refresh**  
- **Refresh:**  
  - Ready all exhausted techs and alien cards.  
  - Remove all damage from your ships.  
  - Pick up all previously played action cards (except Refresh).  
- **Claim Light:**  
  - 1 light per extractor on non-blockaded outer ring planet

- Played Refresh stays on table until all players have played theirs.  

**6. Command**  
- **Move:**  
  - Move each ship (default: 1 adjacent sector).
