## Lost Cities: The Board Game – Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players lead teams of explorers (4 adventurers + 1 researcher) on expeditions across five colored paths, each leading to a lost city. The goal is to advance explorers along paths to score victory points (VPs). Negative points are scored on the first three stepping stones; positive points on the next six. The researcher scores double points. Artifact tiles and end-game bonuses add significant VP potential. The player with the highest total after all expeditions wins.

2. Components  
- 1 Game board with 5 paths, each with 9 stepping stones and event tile spaces  
- 110 Cards: 2 copies each of values 0–10 in 5 colors (one per path)  
- 25 Event Tiles:  
  - 9 Artifact tiles  
  - 9 Arrow tiles  
  - 7 Victory Point (VP) tiles: 2×5, 3×10, 2×15  
- 64 VP tokens (in denominations not specified)  
- 27 Artifact tokens  
- 4 Player Sets: Each set includes 4 adventurers + 1 large researcher (5 figures per player)

3. Setup  
- Place board; place VP and artifact tokens nearby.  
- Shuffle 25 event tiles face down and place one on each event space; flip face up.  
- Shuffle all cards. For 2-player game: remove 30 random cards before dealing.  
- Deal 8 cards face down to each player.  
- Form face-down draw pile with remaining cards.  
- Each player takes 5 figures of one color.  
- Choose starting player.  
- Game length:  
  - Short Game: 1 expedition  
  - Long Game: 3 expeditions  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn has two phases:  
1. Play or Discard a Card  
2. Draw a Card  

Turn Sequence:  
- **Play or Discard**:  
  - Play a card to:  
    - Start a path: Play any card of a color to begin a column. Move one of your figures to the first stepping stone (-20) of that path.  
    - Advance on a path: Play a card of equal or higher value than the last played on that path. Move your figure to the next stepping stone.  
    - Keltis Variant (optional): May start path with high card and play descending values. Direction (ascending/descending) is locked in after second card. Equal values allowed.  
    - Completed Path: If your figure is on the 9th stepping stone (lost city), playing a valid card of that color allows you to move any one of your other figures forward one space.  
  - Discard: Place card face up on discard pile of matching color. If none exists, start a new pile.  
- **Draw**: Take one card from:  
  - Top of face-down draw pile, OR  
  - Top of any face-up discard pile (any color).  

After playing, player must have 8 cards in hand.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Path Movement**:  
  - One figure per player per path. Multiple players may use same path.  
  - Card values must be ≥ last played card (standard). Keltis variant allows strict increasing or decreasing sequences.  
- **Event Tiles**: Resolved immediately when a figure lands on the space:  
  - **Artifact Tile**: Take the tile. It is removed from the board.  
  - **VP Tile**: Gain VP tokens equal to the tile’s value (5, 10, or 15). Tile stays on board.  
  - **Arrow Tile**: Move any one of your figures forward one space. Tile remains. If that space has an event, resolve it immediately (chainable).  
- **Researcher**: Scores double points during round scoring.  
- **Completed Paths**: After a figure reaches space 9, playing additional cards of that color triggers a bonus move on another path.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End of Expedition (Round)**: Triggered when:  
  - 5th explorer total crosses the bridge (between spaces 6 and 7), OR  
  - Last card is drawn from the draw pile.  
  - If the final move lands on an event tile, it is **not** resolved.  
- **Round Scoring**:  
  - Each adventurer scores VP equal to the number on their current space.  
  - Researcher scores **double** the space value.  
  - Negative scores reduce VP total; no player may have less than 0 VP.  
  - Return all figures to supply.  
  - Players holding artifact tiles exchange each for one artifact token (kept for game end).  
- **Next Expedition Setup**:  
  - Re-shuffle all 25 event tiles and re-deal face down to spaces; flip up.  
  - Re-shuffle all cards, deal 8 to each player, form new draw pile.  
  - Victory point tokens and artifact tokens are kept.  
  - Next player clockwise after last to act starts the new expedition.  
- **Game End Scoring (after 3rd expedition or 1st in short game)**:  
  - Use **Long Scoring Track** (3-round game): Convert artifact tokens to VPs. Fewer than 6 artifacts = negative bonus.  
  - Use **Short Scoring Track** (1-round game): Different conversion scale.  
  - Total all VP tokens.  
  - **Winner**: Highest total wins.  
  - **Tiebreaker**: Most artifact tokens.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a card equal to the last one?** Yes, in both standard and Keltis rules.  
- **Can I change direction in Keltis variant?** No. Once a second card sets direction (higher or lower), it is fixed.  
- **Can I discard and then play?** No. Must play or discard first, then draw.  
- **Can I use a card from a completed path to move myself via arrow tile?** No. The completed path move is a direct effect of playing the card, not a movement action.  
- **What happens to artifact tiles after scoring?** Returned to reset the board; player keeps artifact token.  
- **Equal Turns Variant**: Play until all players have taken the same number of turns. Do not resolve event tiles once end condition is known.
