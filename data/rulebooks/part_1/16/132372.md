## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Guildhall is a strategy card game where players build guildhalls by collecting profession cards across five colors. The goal is to be the first to reach 20 or more Victory Points (VP) by completing chapters and purchasing VP cards.

---

### 2. Components  
- 120 Profession Cards (6 professions × 5 colors × 4 copies each)  
- Victory Point (VP) Cards (in denominations of 2, 3, 4, and 7 points)  
- VP Tokens (1-point counters)  
- Rulebook / Player Reference  

Note: All cards in a player’s guildhall, hand size, completed chapters, and total VP are public knowledge.

### 3. Setup  
1. Shuffle the 120 profession cards to form a draw deck.  
2. Shuffle VP cards and deal 5 face-up in a line (the center row). Place the rest in a face-down supply.  
3. Place VP tokens in a common pool.  
4. Deal 9 profession cards to each player.  
5. Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise:  
   - Discard any number of cards (in any order).  
   - Draw back up to 9 cards.  
   - Place 3 cards face-up to the right of your play area to form your starting guildhall.  
     - No duplicates (same profession + color) allowed.  
     - Group cards by profession into chapters.  
6. Keep the area to your left as your action area (for temporary card play).  
7. First player is chosen; play proceeds clockwise.

**Smaller Games (2–3 players):**  
Remove two 5-point VP cards and one of each other VP card type to streamline gameplay.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, take **exactly 2 actions** in any order. Possible actions:  
- Play 1 Card  
- Discard & Draw to 6  
- Buy 1 VP Card  

After resolving both actions and all card effects:  
1. Move all cards from your action area to your guildhall.  
   - If a card would create a duplicate (same profession + color), discard the duplicate instead.  
2. Reorganize cards into chapters by profession.  
3. Score your current VP total (visible to all).  
4. If any player has **20 or more VP**, the game ends immediately after the current turn finishes.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Play 1 Card

- Use its ability based on the current size of that profession’s chapter in your guildhall.  
  - You may use a lower-tier ability than your chapter size allows, or choose not to use it.  
  - You **cannot** use only part of an effect.  
- Restrictions:  
  - Cannot play a card if that exact (profession + color) card is already in your guildhall.  
  - Cannot play more than one card of the same profession per turn.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I look at the discard pile?**  
  Only if a card ability (e.g., Historian) allows it. You may not rearrange it.  
- **What happens if I draw and the deck is empty?**  
  Shuffle the discard pile (except top card) to form a new deck.  
- **Can I use a VP card ability and then discard it?**  
  VP cards go to your action area when bought; they are moved to your guildhall at end of turn (unless duplicate).

  Yes, but you cannot play a card if its exact (profession + color) is already in your guildhall.  
- **What if I have more than 3 completed chapters?**  
  You must immediately discard down to 3. Choice of which to discard is yours.  
- **Can I use Dancer’s extra action to buy a VP card?**  
  Yes—any legal action, including buying a VP card or playing another card.
