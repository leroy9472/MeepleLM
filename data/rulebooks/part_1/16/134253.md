## Hostage Negotiator: Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Hostage Negotiator*, you play as a crisis negotiator responding to high-stakes hostage situations orchestrated by various abductors. Each abductor has unique motivations, demands, and psychological profiles. The objective is to de-escalate the situation by meeting or manipulating their demands, saving hostages, and eliminating or capturing the abductor—before the threat level becomes unmanageable or the pivotal event occurs. Success is measured by mission completion, hostage survival, and stress management across a career of up to 10 missions.

2. Components  
- Abductor Cards (e.g., Arkayne Massua, Donna Scarborough, The Pedersen Twins)  
- Major and Escape Demand Cards  
- Conversation Cards (various costs and effects)  
- Red Terror Cards (introduce complications and events)  
- Threat Track (with levels K, S, and numbered 1–6)  
- Hostage Pool and Hostage Tokens  
- Conversation Points (CP) Tracker  
- Dice (for Threat Rolls and special abilities)  
- Stress Tracker (for career mode)  
- Compensation and Trait Cards (career progression)  
- Pivotal Event Cards (scenario-specific triggers)  
- Meeple or Tokens for Abductors, Hostages, and Negotiator  

3. Setup  
- Choose an abductor and review their starting demands (Major and Escape) as listed on their card.  
- Prepare the Conversation Card supply:  
  - In standard play: Use all available cards.  
  - In career mode (custom_career_v03.md): Remove any Conversation Cards that grant 8 or more CP.  
- Shuffle and place the Red Terror Deck (standard + scenario-specific cards as needed).  
- Set Threat Level to starting value (typically 1 or as specified).  
- Place hostages in the pool (number varies by scenario).  
- For career mode:  
  - Start Stress at 0.  
  - Select abductor randomly or by design.  
  - Apply starting traits or conditions (e.g., Charmer starts with -1 Threat).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of rounds, each with the following phases:  
1. Conversation Phase  
   - Play Conversation Cards from hand (facedown or faceup).  
   - Resolve card effects left to right.  
   - Cards may trigger successes, modify dice, or end the conversation.  
   - You may play 0-cost cards from the Available Area even with 0 CP.  
2. Spend Phase  
   - Spend CP to acquire new Conversation Cards from the Available Area.  
   - Zero-cost cards may always be taken.  
   - Reset CP to 0 unless otherwise modified.  
3. Terror Phase  
   - Draw a Red Terror Card and resolve its effect.  
   - Some cards trigger Threat Rolls (roll dice equal to current Threat Level).  
   - Effects may include hostage kills, additional demands, or abductor actions.  
   - Abductor cannot be captured during this phase.  
4. Check for Pivotal Event  
   - If triggered, a final Conversation Phase occurs.  
   - Win condition may change (e.g., eliminate abductor).  

Repeat until:  
- Abductor is eliminated/captured.  
- All demands are conceded and abductor escapes.  
- Too many hostages are lost.  
- Final Conversation fails.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Threat Level:  
  - Ranges from K (Critical), S (Severe), to 1–6 (increasing tension).  
  - Determines number of dice in Threat Rolls.  
  - Certain achievements require specific Threat levels (e.g., win on "K").  
- Conversation Cards:  
  - Can be played faceup (effect resolved) or facedown (+1 CP each).  
  - Some cards allow rerolls, conversion of 4s to successes, or demand concessions.  
  - Playing two facedown cards can convert a 4 into a success (but die remains 4).  
- Demand Concession:  
  - Major, Minor, and Escape Demands vary by abductor.  
  - Conceding may reduce Threat, save hostages, or trigger abilities.  
  - Some achievements require winning without conceding any demands.  
- Threat Roll Resolution:  
  - All modifications (rerolls, conversions) occur before resolving card effects.  
  - Multiple successes on a roll do not stack—only success/failure matters unless specified.  
- Hostage Mechanics:  
  - Hostages can be saved, killed, or taken during Terror Phase.  
  - Saving all hostages or a minimum number often contributes to victory.  
  - Abductor capture only possible outside Terror Phase.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Victory Conditions (vary by abductor):  
  - Eliminate or capture the abductor.  
  - Concede all necessary demands before pivotal event.  
  - Save required number of hostages (e.g., half or all).  
- Defeat Conditions:  
  - Too many hostages killed (e.g., more than half).  
  - Pivotal Event occurs and abductor survives.  
  - Failure in Final Conversation.  
- Career Mode Scoring:  
  - Play up to 10 missions.  
  - Score = (Number of successful missions × 3) − Total Stress.  
  - Stress accumulates from:  
    - Hostage killed: +2 (+4 if at Threat Level S)  
    - Conversation ends at K: +1  
    - Pivotal Event revealed: +2  
    - Mission failure: +1 (+3 on hard mode)  
    - Reduced by 1 per 3 hostages saved at mission end  
  - After each mission:  
    - Success: Roll 1d20 for compensation.  
    - Failure: Roll 2d20, choose one compensation.  
    - Every 3 successes: Choose compensation manually.  
  - Compensations include:  
    - Traits (e.g., Confident: +2 CP start)  
    - Resources (e.g., Snitch: gain 6 CP anytime)  
    - Experience (add cards to supply, buy resources)  
    - Stress Relief (immediate stress reduction)  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I play 0-cost cards if I have 0 CP?  
  A: Yes. You may take them from the Available Area.  
- Q: Can I use facedown cards to get +1 CP if the conversation ends?  
  A: No. If the conversation ends (e.g., Abductor hangs up), no further actions.  
- Q: Can I reroll a die after converting a 4 to a success?  
  A: No. Modifications happen in player-chosen order, but once resolved, no further changes.  
- Q: Can I capture the abductor during the Terror Phase?  
  A: No. Abductor capture is only possible during or after the Conversation Phase.  
- Q: What if I draw "Your Time is Running Out" with only 1 Terror Card left?  
  A: Discard half (rounded down) — so 0 cards. Effect is ignored.  
- Q: Can I recycle 0-cost cards after the Pivotal Event?  
  A: No. Cards played go to discard; they do not return until next Spend Phase (which may not occur).  
- Q: Do I roll Threat-level dice for "I've Taken More Hostages"?  
  A: No. Roll only 1 die, as specified.  
- Q: Can I resolve the "single success" part of a card twice if I roll two successes?  
  A: No. Each card resolves once, with best possible outcome.
