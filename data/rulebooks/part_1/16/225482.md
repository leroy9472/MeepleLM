5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Playing a trick**:  
     - The first player leads by playing any card (subject to opening rules).  
     - Each subsequent player must play a card of a color already present in the trick, if possible.  
     - If a player cannot follow any color in the trick, they may play any card from their hand.  
   - **Winning a trick**:  
     - Determine the color(s) with the most cards in the trick.  
     - If one color is most frequent, the highest-ranked card of that color wins the trick.  
     - If two or more colors are tied for most cards, the highest-ranked card among the tied colors wins.  
   - **Trick collection**:  
     - The winner places the trick’s cards face down in a separate pile in front of them.  
     - Each pile represents one trick. Piles remain visible so all players can track trick counts.
