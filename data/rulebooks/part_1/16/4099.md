## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the land of Keydom, a grand Keythedral is being constructed near Keytown. The townsfolk—each represented by a player—contribute resources gathered from surrounding fields to fund construction. The Keythedral is built in five stages, with each stage requiring different materials. Workers from cottages gather basic resources (timber, stone, food, water, wine), while craftsmen provide special "craft" materials (ironwork, stained glass, gold) in exchange for basic resources.

The objective is to contribute the most to the Keythedral's construction. Victory is determined by the total value of acquired building tiles (which represent honored seats in the completed Keythedral) plus the point value of unused resources and craft cubes at the end of the game.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place **Keythedral tile** in center of table.  
2. Place **Keythedral mat** beside playing area.  
   - For **short game**: Place building tiles (number side up) only on grey spaces.  
   - For **full game**: Also place tiles on orange spaces.  
   - Shuffle tiles before placing; discard unused without revealing.  
   - *Strategic Variant*: Reveal building costs from start (all tiles face-up).  
3. Place **Keytown mat** on opposite side. Place craft cubes (white, purple, yellow) on their designated areas.  
4. Each player chooses a color and receives:  
   - 5 cottage tiles  
   - 10 worker counters  
   - 3 fence markers  
   - 1 screen  
   - 1 turn order card  
   - Place screen in front of them.  
5. Shuffle **Law cards** and place face-down stack on Keytown mat. Reveal two face-down cards on "New Law" spaces.  
6. Place **resource cubes** in store (box bottom), accessible to all.  
7. Place **Work Order markers (1–5)** next to Keythedral mat.  
8. Choose **start player** (youngest, or random). They take **start player marker**.  
9. **Field tile selection**:  
   - Remove field tiles numbered higher than player count.  
   - Place four **number 1** tiles around Keythedral tile:  
     - Two grey (quarries) opposite each other  
     - Two brown (woods) opposite each other  
     - Place them with number side down.  
10. Remaining field tiles are shuffled and placed in opaque bag.  
11. Starting with start player and proceeding clockwise:  
    - Each player draws one field tile from bag and places it orthogonally adjacent to any existing field or cottage tile.  
    - After placing, player places one **cottage tile** (any number) diagonally adjacent to any field tile (including newly placed).  
    - Cottages are placed with **light (cottage) side up**.  
    - Field tiles must connect orthogonally to other field tiles; diagonally to cottages.  
    - Players repeat until each has placed **5 field tiles** and **5 cottage tiles**.  
12. **Turn over** the row of **number 4 building tiles** to reveal their costs.  
13. Game begins with start player.

> **Placement Tips**:  
> - Avoid placing your cottage adjacent to a same-number cottage of player to your right (they’ll often block access).  
> - Aim for cottages adjacent to 3+ fields for flexibility.  
> - Stone (grey) and timber (brown) are critical early; wine (red) becomes useful mid-game.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of **5 phases**, played clockwise:

#### Phase 1: Place Worker Counters  
- Start player takes **Work Order marker '1'** and places it on one number (1–5) on Keythedral mat. This selects which cottage number activates first.  
- Start player places **one worker** from a matching-number cottage onto an adjacent **empty** field.  
- Other players, in clockwise order, do the same with their matching-number cottage.  
- Next player (to left of start player) places **Work Order marker '2'** on remaining number. Same placement process follows.  
- Continue until all **5 Work Order markers** are placed.  
- Players with **houses** (upgraded cottages) place **two workers** during their activation, one at a time, into **different adjacent empty fields**.  
- If no legal field is available, worker(s) cannot be placed.

> With fewer than 5 players, some players place multiple Work Order markers.

#### Phase 2: Collect Resource Cubes  
- Starting with start player, each player collects **one resource cube per worker** from the **store**, matching the field type:  
  - Grey (quarry) → Black (stone)  
  - Brown (woods) → Brown (timber)  
  - Blue (lake) → Blue (water)  
  - Green (farm) → Green (food)  
  - Red (vineyard) → Red (wine)  
- If a resource is depleted, player receives nothing for that worker.  
- Collected cubes are placed **behind player screen**.

#### Phase 3: Take Actions  
Players take turns clockwise, starting with start player. Each may perform **one action per turn**, repeating until:  
- A player takes a **New Law card**, or  
- All players **pass in succession**.

Available actions:

**A. Acquire Building Tile**  
- Pay exact **resource and/or craft cubes** shown on any face-up building tile.  
- Return cubes to **store**.  
- Take building tile and keep **behind screen**.  
- After last tile of a row is acquired, **turn over next row** (4 → 6 → 8 → 10 → 12).  
- Game ends immediately after **last tile (12)** is acquired.  
- *Strategic Variant*: All tiles are visible, but only bottom row may be purchased.

**B. Convert Cottage to House**  
- Spend **1 black (stone) + 1 brown (timber)** to store.  
- Flip any cottage tile to **dark (house) side**.  
- From now on, sends **2 workers** during Phase 1 (if space allows).

**C. Build or Remove a Fence**  
- **Build**: Spend **1 brown (timber)** to place one of your **3 fences** between a cottage/house and adjacent field. Blocks worker access.  
- **Remove**: Spend **2 red (wine)** to remove **any player's fence** (any color). Removed permanently.  
- If a cottage/house is **fully fenced** (all field-adjacent sides blocked), it is **removed and immediately repositioned** anywhere legal.  
- Fences stay in place. House remains a house when repositioned.

**D. Purchase Craft Cube**  
Buy **one** craft cube from Keytown mat:  
- **White (ironwork)**: 2 any resources  
- **Purple (stained glass)**: 3 any resources  
- **Yellow (gold)**: 4 any resources  
- Spent craft cubes go **beside mat** (not back to supply).  
- If out of stock, may reuse spent cubes from beside mat.

**E. Trade with Resource Supply**  
- Trade **2 basic resources** for **1 basic resource** of any type.  
- Cannot trade for or spend craft cubes in trade.

**F. Take a New Law Card**  
- Spend **1 basic or craft cube** to take one of two face-down New Law cards.  
- Card effects are **hidden** until played.  
- Card can only be played during the **phase indicated** on the card.  
- Once played, read aloud and resolve effect. Then **remove card from game**.  
- After taking a Law card, player **cannot take further actions** this phase (unless playing the card now).  
- When both Law cards are taken, replace them at end of phase if possible.

**G. Pass**  
- Player may pass at any time.  
- May act later unless all players pass in succession or they’ve taken a Law card.

#### Phase 4: Retrieve Worker Counters and Prepare  
- All workers are returned to players’ areas.  
- Work Order markers are removed from Keythedral mat.  
- If one or both New Law cards were taken, replace with new ones from deck (if available).

#### Phase 5: Change Start Player  
- Current start player passes marker to player on left.  
- That player (now left of holder) starts **bidding auction**:  
  - Players bid cubes (any type; each = 1 point) to win start player token.  
  - Bidding proceeds clockwise; must raise or pass.  
  - Holder of token may **match last bid** or pass.  
  - Winner pays bid to **previous token holder** and takes token.  
  - Winner **chooses** who is start player next round (can keep it).  
- Bids are **hidden**; cubes paid from private supply.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Worker Placement**: Controlled by Work Order markers; number determines activation order.  
- **Resource Gathering**: Tied to field access; limited by fences and occupation.  
- **Field & Cottage Placement**: Strategic during setup; affects long-term access.  
- **Craft Cubes**: Purchased with resources; used in building tiles; not replenished once spent.  
- **Fences**: Defensive/offensive tools; can force repositioning.  
- **Law Cards**: Hidden effects; introduce variability and timing tactics.  
- **Auction**: Start player token rotates; auction determines turn order influence.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends **immediately** when **last building tile (12)** is acquired.  
- Each player scores:  
  - **Sum of values** on acquired building tiles (reverse side: 4–12)  
  - **Unused cubes**:  
    - Yellow (gold): 4 points  
    - Purple (stained glass): 3 points  
    - White (ironwork): 2 points  
    - All basic resources (brown, black, green, blue, red): 1 point each  
- **Highest total wins**. Tiebreak: most building tiles.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I place a cottage not adjacent to the field I just played?**  
  A: Yes. Cottage must be diagonally adjacent to **any** field tile, not necessarily the one just placed.

- **Q: Can I place two workers from a house if only one field is free?**  
  A: Only one worker may be placed. Second is not played.

- **Q: What if I can’t place a worker during Phase 1?**  
  A: That worker is idle; no resource collected.

- **Q: Can I build a fence blocking my own cottage?**  
  A: Yes. This can be used to trigger repositioning.

- **Q: Can I reposition a house to a spot not adjacent to any field?**  
  A: No. Must be placed diagonally adjacent to at least one field tile.

- **Q: What happens if Law card deck runs out?**  
  A: No new Law cards are added. Only existing ones on board are available.

- **Q: Can I trade craft cubes?**  
  A: No. Craft cubes cannot be traded or used in trade actions.

- **Q: Can I buy a craft cube if none are on the mat?**  
  A: Yes. Use spent cubes from beside the mat.
