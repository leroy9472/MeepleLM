### 1. Lore & Objective
In the fantasy world of Laar, players take on the role of Viceroys competing to build the most powerful nation over 12 rounds.

Victory is determined by final scoring after the 12th round.

### 2. Components
- 60 character cards  
- 20 law cards  
- 4 auction cards (blue, green, yellow, red)  
- 64 gemstones (16 each in blue, red, green, yellow)  
- 33 double-sided magic/science tokens  
- 17 double-sided attack/defense tokens

- Rulebook

### 3. Setup
1. Place the 4 auction cards face up in a row, arrows pointing in the same direction.
2. Form token piles: magic/science, attack/defense, power point, and bonus tokens.
3. Set up gem reserve:
   - 2 players: 8 gems per color (32 total)  
   - 3 players: 12 gems per color (48 total)  
   - 4 players: 16 gems per color (64 total)  
4. Each player takes a screen and:
   - Takes 2 gems of each color (8 total) behind the screen  
   - Randomly returns 2 gems to the reserve (6 gems remain hidden)  
5. Shuffle character cards and deal 4 to each player. Each player:
   - Chooses one card to start their pyramid at Level 1 (immediately receives its Level 1 reward)  
   - Chooses one of the remaining three to keep in hand  
   - Returns the other two to the character deck  
6. Shuffle the character deck and:
   - Count out 48 cards for the large deck (place face down)  
   - Remaining cards form the small deck (place face down)  
7. Reveal 4 cards from the large deck, placing one face up below each auction card.
8. Shuffle law cards and deal 3 to each player. Place the law deck face down next to the small deck.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 12 rounds. Each round has two phases:
1. **Auction Phase** – Up to 3 bidding turns to acquire character cards
2. **Development Phase** – Up to 3 building turns to play cards into pyramids

After 12 rounds, proceed to final scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Auction Phase
- All players simultaneously bid using a gem of the color matching the auction card they want.
- Players may also bid an attack token instead of a gem, which grants immediate card selection.
- Resolution:
  - If only one player bids on a color, they take one available card (base or tip) into their hand.
  - If multiple players bid on a color:
    - If there are enough cards and players agree on distribution, they take cards.
    - If no agreement or insufficient cards, all bids are lost; players may re-bid in next auction turn.
  - Players who do not bid (pass) receive 3 gems + 1 per science token in their pyramid.
- After resolution:
  - Players who won a card or passed exit the auction.
  - Remaining players may participate in up to two more auction turns.
  - After 3 turns, any unplaced players are considered to have passed.
- End of phase:
  - Discard all cards at the tips of auction arrows.
  - Slide base cards to the tips.
  - Reveal 4 new cards from the large deck to the bases.

#### Development Phase
- Consists of up to 3 turns.
- Each turn:
  - Players simultaneously choose to:
    - Play a card face down
    - Discard a card to draw 2 gems
    - Pass
  - Passers exit the phase and cannot act further.
  - Discards are resolved first (drawing gems in lowest-card order).
  - Played cards are revealed and resolved in ascending numerical order.
- Playing a character card:
  - Pay gems for the target level and all levels below.
  - Level 5 requires paying Level 4 gem twice.
  - Only receive the reward for the level placed (not lower levels).
  - Placing on Level 5: choose either 15 power points OR all Level 1–3 rewards.
- Playing a law card:
  - Free to play (no cost).
  - Cannot be placed on Level 5.
  - Resolve immediate effect (one-shot, continuous, or end-game).
- Pyramid rules:
  - Cards must be orthogonally adjacent.
  - Higher levels must rest on two cards below.
  - Maximum of 5 levels.
  - Cards cannot be moved unless a law card allows it.
  - Completing a single-color circle (3 card corners + 1 side) grants 1 gem of that color.
- Infinite gemstones:
  - Can be used once per development phase to reduce cost by 1 gem of matching color.
  - Cannot be used in Auction Phase.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after 12 rounds. Final scoring:

1. **Single-Color Circles**: 1 point per level of the top card in the circle. Bonus tokens add points based on circle color.
2. **Infinite Gemstones**: 1 point per level of the card containing it. Bonus tokens add points based on gem color.
3. **Law Cards**: Score points as specified on each card in the pyramid.
4. **Power Point Tokens**: Sum all tokens in the pyramid.
5. **Magic Tokens**: Each magic token scores points equal to the sum of all magic bonus tokens in the pyramid.
6. **Completed Sets**: 12 points per set of one defense, one magic, and one science token (each token used only once).
7. **Attack Tokens**: Lose 4 points per attack token held by opponents. Each defense token negates one opponent’s attack token.

Highest score wins. No tiebreaker defined.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Infinite Gem Usage**: Once per development phase, not per turn.
- **Replacing Cards**: Completing a single-color circle via replacement grants a bonus gem.
- **Law Card 65 (Reassignments)**: Replaced card goes to hand and may be played without cost in any future turn.
- **Law Card 67 (Barter Policy)**: Exchanged gem returns to the original player’s reserve.
- **Law Card 68 (Referendum)**: Scores 1 point per card in pyramid, including the hidden starting card.
- **Law Card 69 (Bureaucracy)**: Only functions if at least 4 cards remain in the small deck.
- **Law Card 76 (Stronger Royal Treasury)**: Gems placed on the card are no longer spendable.
- **Tie Resolution**: When simultaneous actions conflict, resolve in order of lowest-numbered card in pyramid (ascending).
- **Gem Availability**: If no gems of a required color are available, the action cannot be completed.
