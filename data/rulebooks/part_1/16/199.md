## MANHATTAN

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In Manhattan, players act as developers competing to build the most impressive skyline across six cities. The goal is to earn the most points over several rounds by constructing the tallest buildings, claiming majorities in cities, and owning individual buildings. Victory comes through strategic placement, area control, and height dominance.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Game board (featuring six cities labeled A–F)  
- 45 Building cards (5 of each type; each card shows a building site within one of the six cities)  
- 4 Player Boards  
- 96 Building blocks (24 per player in 4 colors), broken down per player:  
  - 3 blocks of 4 stories  
  - 4 blocks of 3 stories  
  - 6 blocks of 2 stories  
  - 11 blocks of 1 story  
- 4 Scoring Markers (1-story blocks, one per player)  
- 1 Start Player Block (Black)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center of the table.  
   - **Important**: Players must sit such that each sees the board from the correct orientation (i.e., cities are consistently labeled A–F from their perspective).  
2. Each player:  
   - Chooses a color  
   - Takes their Player Board  
   - Takes all 24 building blocks of their color  
   - Places their scoring marker on "0" of the scoring track on the game board  
3. The oldest player becomes the starting player and takes the Start Player Block (black).  
4. Shuffle the building cards and deal 4 face-down cards to each player.  
5. Place the remaining deck face-down next to the board.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **4 rounds** (fewer or more depending on player count). Each round follows this sequence:

1. **Selection of Building Blocks**  
2. **Playing Cards and Building Blocks (on each turn)**  
3. **Scoring**  

Repeat for each round. After the final round, the game ends and the winner is determined.

#### 1. Selection of Building Blocks  
- At the start of each round, each player selects **6 building blocks** from their supply.  
- Starting with the Start Player and proceeding clockwise, each player chooses 6 blocks and places them on their Player Board.  
- These 6 blocks are the only ones available for use during that round.  
- Players may look at their hand of cards before selecting blocks.

#### 2. Playing Cards and Building Blocks  
On a player’s turn:  
a. **Play a Card**  
   - Play one card from your hand face-up next to your Player Board.  
   - The card must be oriented so the image is right-side-up from your perspective.  
   - You **may not rotate** the card.  
   - The red-marked area on the card indicates the **exact site** (within one of the six cities) where you must build.

b. **Place a Building Block**  
   - Choose one of your 6 selected blocks and place it on the **site shown on the card**, in **any city** (A–F).  
     - Example: If your card shows site 2 in city A, you may place your block on site 2 in **any city** (A–F), as long as it’s the same relative site.  
   - **Condition A**: Must build on the same site number as shown on the card.  
   - **Condition B**: You may stack on top of existing buildings.  
     - After placing, your total number of floors on that building must be **at least equal** to the previous top owner’s floor count.  
     - You **cannot** combine multiple blocks in a single turn to meet height requirements.  
   - If your block is on top after placement, you **own** that building.  
- After placing, draw **1 card** from the deck to replenish your hand.

Turns proceed clockwise until all players have played all 6 cards and placed all 6 blocks.

#### 3. Scoring (End of Round)  
After all players have placed their 6 blocks, score the following:

**A. Highest Building**  
- The player who owns the **tallest building** on the board gains **3 points**.  
- If there is a tie for tallest height, **no one** scores the 3 points.

**B. Majority in Each City**  
- For each city (A–F), the player who owns the **most buildings** scores **2 points**.  
- There must be a **single leader**; if tied, **no one** scores for that city.

**C. Individual Buildings**  
- Each player scores **1 point** for **each building they own** (i.e., each building where their block is on top).

After scoring:  
- The Start Player passes the Start Player Block to the player on their left.  
- Players **keep** their remaining cards in hand for the next round.  
- Begin the next round with block selection.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends after **4 rounds** in a standard 4-player game.  
- All building blocks will have been used.  
- The player with the **most total points** wins.

**Tiebreakers**:  
1. The player who owns the **tallest building** on the board.  
2. If still tied, the player with the **most city majorities** (number of cities where they scored 2 points) wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build on a site that already has a building?**  
  Yes, by stacking. You must meet the floor count condition relative to the current top owner.

- **Can I play a card and not build?**  
  No. Playing a card requires placing a block on the indicated site type.

- **Do I have to use all 6 blocks in a round?**  
  Yes. Each round, you must play 6 cards and place 6 blocks.

- **What if the deck runs out of cards?**  
  Players keep their hands between rounds. Only 4 cards are dealt initially; players draw 1 per turn. With 4 rounds × 6 turns = 24 total plays, and 45 cards in deck, the deck will not run out.

- **Can I rotate my card to choose a different site?**  
  No. Cards must be placed right-side-up from your perspective. The site is fixed by orientation.
