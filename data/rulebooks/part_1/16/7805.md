# FINSTERE – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the dark fortress of Prince Fieso, players attempt to escape after being imprisoned for rescuing magical fetishes. The monstrous Furunkulus guards the halls, hunting intruders. Players must navigate treacherous corridors, using terrain to hide or misdirect the monster. The goal is to guide a set number of their tokens safely out of the fortress while avoiding being eaten.

**Primary Objective**: Be the first player to successfully move the required number of your tokens out of the exit. The exact number depends on player count (3 tokens in 2–4 player games, 2 in 5–7 player games).

### 2. Components  
- 1 folded game board (plan)  
- 17 floor tiles (used in advanced game)  
- 3 regular stones  
- 2 crystal stones (monster can see through)  
- 4 turning stones (right turn)  
- 2 turning stones (180° turn)  
- 2 teleporters (paired)  
- 2 blood pools (both sides functional)  
- Monster movement tiles:  
  - 8 total: values 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10, 1 hit, 2 hits  
- 1 starting player tile  
- 25 player tokens in 7 colors (each token has two sides summing to 7: e.g., 1/6, 3/4, etc.)  
- 1 monster building kit (assemble one monster from pieces)

### 3. Setup  
**Basic Game Setup**:
1. Place the folded board in the center.
2. Shuffle monster movement tiles and place face down beside the board.
3. Each player takes all tokens of one color:
   - 2–4 players: 6 tokens (values 1, 3, 4, 5 — note: sum of both sides always 7)
   - 5–7 players: 3 tokens (values 1, 4, 5)
4. Place all player tokens beside the entrance, **white (colored) side up**.
5. Assemble the monster and place it on the corner space next to the exit, facing the "M" at the board edge.
6. Place components on board as shown in the diagram (stones and blood pools only; teleporters removed).
7. The player who looks most like the monster starts and takes the starting player tile.

**Advanced Game Setup**:
- Use front sides of floor tiles, blood pools, and teleporters.
- Place all floor tiles and starting player tile beside the board.
- In turn order, each player selects and places one floor tile:
  - Cannot place on the 3 spaces adjacent to entrance or exit (including corner and orthogonally adjacent).
  - Tiles must be placed exactly on spaces; no overlapping.
  - No two teleporters may be adjacent.
- After placement, next player takes starting player tile and begins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each full turn has two phases:

#### Phase 1: Player Movement (Tokens)
- Players move in clockwise order.
- Each player moves **one** of their tokens up to a number of spaces equal to the **visible number** on the token.
- Movement:
  - Allowed in any orthogonal direction (no diagonals).
  - Can change direction freely.
  - Can pass through spaces with other tokens (each counts toward movement cost).
  - Must end on an **empty space**.
- Entering the board: First space is the entrance corner. Exiting: Requires **one extra point** after the exit corner.
- After moving, **flip the token** to its other side (black or white). This shows it has moved and sets its movement value for next turn.
- **First Turn Only**: Each player moves **only two tokens** onto the board. Remaining tokens are flipped without moving.
- From Turn 2 onward: All tokens are moved.

**Special Movement Rules**:
- **Pushing Stones**:
  - A token can push a stone if the space behind is empty.
  - Cannot push stones off the board unless forced by the monster.
  - Pushing a stone onto entrance/exit corner removes it from the game.
- **Blood Pools**:
  - Entering a blood pool costs 1 movement point.
  - Token slides straight through to the space beyond.
  - If that space is blocked, token stops on the last pool space and needs **another point** to exit sideways.
  - Cannot end movement on a blood pool if the exit space is occupied (would land on another token).
  - Pushing a stone into a blood pool: It slides; stops if space beyond is free, otherwise remains on last pool space.
- **Teleporters (Advanced)**:
  - Players **cannot** move onto teleporter spaces (treated as board edge).
  - Monster can look over and through teleporters.
  - Monster entering a teleporter moves instantly to the paired teleporter, facing the arrow direction, and looks before continuing.

**Prohibited Actions**:
- Cannot push other player tokens.
- Cannot move through the monster’s space.

#### Phase 2: Monster Movement  
After all tokens are moved:
1. Reveal top monster movement tile.
2. Monster moves according to tile:
   - **Numbered tile (e.g., 5, 7, 8)**: Monster moves up to that many steps.
   - **"1 hit" or "2 hits"**: Monster moves until it eats 1 or 2 tokens (or pushes them off), max 20 spaces.
3. **Exception**: First card cannot be "hit" card. Draw until a numbered card appears; reshuffle others.

**Monster Movement Mechanics**:
- Each step consists of:
  1. **Look**: Monster checks straight ahead, left, and right (never behind or diagonally).
  2. **Move**: One space in chosen direction.
- If it sees **one token**, it turns toward it and moves.
- If it sees **multiple tokens**, it moves toward the **closest**.
- If **equal distance**, it **keeps current direction** (monster is confused).
- **Line of Sight**: Blocked by stones. **Crystal stones do not block** sight.
- **Pushing**:
  - Monster pushes all objects (tokens, stones) in front.
  - Blood pools are immovable.
  - Pushed objects on blood slide accordingly.
  - Tokens pushed off board count as **eaten**.
- **Walking Through Walls**:
  - If monster moves off board, it re-enters on opposite side at matching letter, continuing in same direction.

**After Movement**:
- Any token on the same space as monster is **eaten**.
- Eaten tokens:
  - **Stage 1**: Placed back at entrance with current number face up.
  - **Stage 2**: Removed from game permanently.
- Starting player passes to the left.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Token Movement & Flipping**: Each token alternates between two values (sum to 7). Movement value changes every turn.
- **Hiding & Line of Sight**: Use stones to block monster vision. Crystals allow monster to see through.
- **Environmental Hazards**:
  - Blood pools: Enable sliding; require careful movement.
  - Turning stones: Alter monster direction when it attempts to move onto them (only if no token in sight).
  - Teleporters: Redirect monster instantly.
- **Monster AI**:
  - Rule-based movement: sight → closest target → movement.
  - Cannot see backward; cannot see through walls or stones.
  - Prioritizes visible, closest prey.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game Stages**:
- **Stage 1**: Eaten tokens return to entrance.
- **Stage 2**: Begins after **second-to-last** monster card is drawn.
  - Reshuffle all monster cards (except last) into new deck.
  - Now, eaten tokens are **permanently removed**.

**Winning Conditions**:
- **Primary**: First player to move the required number of tokens out of the exit:
  - 2–4 players: **3 tokens**
  - 5–7 players: **2 tokens**
- **Secondary (if no one wins)**: If all but last card are used and no one has won, game ends. Most tokens **successfully exited** wins.
- **All tokens eaten in Stage 2**: Player who exited the most tokens wins.

**Special Notes**:
- Game may end during Stage 1 if win condition is met.
- In 2-player games: Opponent may get extra moves after one player finishes, enabling comeback.
- For 6–7 players: To extend game, replace "5" monster card with "3 hits" card.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a token skip movement?**  
  Yes. A player may choose not to move a token (0 spaces), but must still flip it.

- **What if all my tokens are out or eaten?**  
  You pass your turn. Game continues until win condition or end.

- **Can monster eat multiple tokens in one turn?**  
  Yes, especially with "2 hits" or high-number cards.

- **Does monster look after each move?**  
  Yes. After every space moved, it looks again.

- **Can monster see through blood pools?**  
  No. Monster cannot see through blood; vision is blocked.

- **Can monster teleport and eat in same move?**  
  Yes. After teleporting, it looks and can immediately move toward and eat a visible token.

- **What happens if monster pushes a stone into a turning stone?**  
  Turning stones affect only the **monster**, not pushed objects. Stone is pushed normally.

- **Can player push a stone onto a blood pool to block it?**  
  Yes. Stone slides; if space beyond is occupied, it stops on last blood space.

- **Does monster re-enter board if it walks off during a look phase?**  
  No. Movement only triggers re-entry. Looking is directional, not positional.
