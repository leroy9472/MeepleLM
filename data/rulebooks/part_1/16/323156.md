## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the 16th century, the Stroganov merchant family gains favor with the Tsar and is granted lands to expand Russian influence into Siberia. Players take on the role of Stroganov family members, guiding Cossack hunters eastward to hunt furs, establish outposts, fulfill the Tsar’s wishes, and gather stories. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) over four years (rounds), each consisting of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Victory is determined by end-game scoring, with ties broken by how far a player’s Cossack has advanced into Siberia.

3. Setup  
1. Place the game board and starting tile.  
2. Shuffle 5 “S”-marked landscape tiles and place faceup to the right of the start tile. Shuffle the remaining 21 landscape tiles, place 7 more faceup, forming a 12-tile row. Remaining tiles form a draw pile.  
3. Shuffle the 6 setup furs. Draw 1 randomly and place it on the trade action space (3a). Place the remaining 5, lowest to highest value, one in each region (left to right). These set advanced action costs.  
4. Draw 76 furs; place one fur on each fur spot of the 12 landscape tiles. Skip spots marked “4” if playing with <4 players. Arrange furs per tile with lowest value on top. Place a tiger tile beside the highest-value fur on the 12th tile.  
5. Draw 6 furs and place them in the market.  
6. Shuffle 5 village tiles and place one faceup in each region.  
7. Separate Yurt Tiles into “A” and “B” stacks. Shuffle each. Place one “A” yurt faceup in each region. Stack remaining “A” on “B” and store.  
8. Players choose color, take Cossack, player board (side “a” recommended), trophy token, story token, VP token.  
9. Randomly determine player order; place Cossacks on starting tile from right (first) to left (last).  
10. Place VP tokens at 0 on VP track; story tokens at 0 on story track.  
11. Shuffle “A” and “B” song tiles. Place number of “A” song tiles equal to player count faceup. Store remaining “A” on “B”.  
12. Players receive horses based on turn order (see rules).  
13. Each player takes 1 outpost and 1 coin.  
14. Separate Tsar’s Wish cards into “S”, “A”, “B”. Set “S” aside. Place one “A” card faceup in each region. Store remaining “A” on “B”.  
15. Reveal (number of players + 1) “S” cards. Place one random fur on each. In reverse player order, each player chooses one card and fur. Return unused card and fur to box.  
16. Place season marker on Spring.  
17. Place 12/17/20 banner tokens in supply (for 2/3/4 players).  
18. Place remaining components in general supply.  
Optional: In 2-player, place unused outposts on “2” and “3-” spaces. In 3-player, place outposts on “3-” spaces.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each year consists of four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter.  
- Spring/Summer/Autumn: Players take turns in order (rightmost Cossack first). Each turn:  
  1. Move  
  2. Perform 1 Basic Action  
  3. Perform 1 or 2 Main Actions (second costs fur)  
- Winter: All players perform simultaneously:  
  1. Income  
  2. Storytelling  
  3. Administration (reset board)  
After 4th Winter, score and determine winner.

5. Core Mechanics  
**Move (Step 1)**  
- Must move 1 or 2 tiles right.  
- Pay to move extra:  
  - +1 tile: 1 horse  
  - +2 tiles: 3 horses  
  - +3 tiles: 6 horses  
- Gaps in tile row are skipped. Cannot move past rightmost tile.

**Basic Actions (Step 2 – choose one)**  
- Take 1 coin  
- Take 4 horses (white = 1, burgundy = 3; exchangeable)  
- Move 1–2 tiles left or right (no horse payment)  
- Hunt: Take lowest-value fur for free. Pay 1 horse per skipped lower fur.  
  - May hunt second fur by paying 1 coin (follow same rules).  
- Trade: Discard fur matching trade setup fur. Choose 2 of:  
  - Take 1 coin  
  - Gain 2 story points  
  - Move 1–2 tiles (any direction, no horse cost)  
  - Take 3 horses  
  (May choose same bonus twice.)

**Main Actions (Step 3 – one free, second costs fur)**  
May perform one main action (basic or advanced) for free.  
- Second **basic** action: pay any fur.  
- Second **advanced** action: pay fur matching region fur where Cossack is or outpost exists.  
  (Pay 1 coin to set any fur to required value.)

**Advanced Actions**  
Available where Cossack is or outpost exists:  
- **Visit Village**: Gain benefit (e.g., banner + horses, story + coin, market fur, trophy). Tile remains.  
- **Use Yurt**: Take tile, gain benefit (e.g., story + draw furs, market furs), discard tile.  
- **Take Tsar’s Wish Card**: Add to hand. No limit.  
- **Build Outpost**: Place from personal supply on leftmost available space in region. Pay 0/1/2 horses as marked. Max 1 per region.  
- **Claim Landscape Tile**: Pay 2 furs matching region fur + 1 matching fur per remaining fur/tiger on tile. Take tile and all furs into supply. Gain immediate reward (VP, coin, horses, furs, story). Tile placed to right of player board. Score VP at end for sets of 3 or 4 different landscape types.

**Auxiliary Actions (any time during turn)**  
- **Buy Fur**: Pay 5 horses to take 1 from market or 2 from bag (keep 1). Refill market if needed.  
- **Trade Furs**:  
  - Pay 1 horse + 1 fur → take lower-value fur from market.  
  - Pay 2 furs → take any fur from market.  
- **Fulfill Tsar’s Wish**: Return required furs (red-framed) to bag. Score immediate VP. Slide card under player board for ongoing effect. Tiger = wild (spend it). Pay coin to adjust fur value.  
- **Draw from Bag**: Always draw 2, keep 1, return 1.  
- **Bear Furs (value 8)**: Gain 2 story points immediately when acquired.

**Winter Phase**  
1. **Income**:  
   - 2 horses + 1 per banner token.  
   - Fulfilled Tsar’s Wish cards may grant extra income (horses, story, coins, furs, actions).  
2. **Storytelling**:  
   - Furthest player: +2 story points. Second: +1.  
   - Then, in player order (furthest first), each may buy one song tile by spending story points. Gain reward, discard tile.  
   - If story token reaches or passes space 12, may immediately gain one song reward (spend points, tile stays).  
3. **Administration (Years 1–3 only)**:  
   - Return Cossacks to start, maintain order.  
   - Shift landscape tiles left to close gaps. Add new tiles to right to restore 12. Add furs as in setup. If new 12th tile, add tiger beside highest fur.  
   - Replace market: discard all, draw 6 new.  
   - Replace song tiles: discard unclaimed, reveal number equal to players.  
   - Replace yurt tiles: shift left, refill empty spaces with “A” tiles in years 1–2, “B” in 3–4.  
   - Replace Tsar’s Wish cards: shift left, refill with “A” in years 1–2, “B” in 3–4.  
   - Advance season marker to Spring.

6. Scoring & End Game  
After 4th Winter, score:  
1. **Tsar’s Wish Cards**: Score end-game VP from “B” cards (e.g., 2–4 VP, VP per outpost, tiger, coin, etc.).  
2. **Landscape Tile Sets**: 3 different types = 3 VP, 4 different = 6 VP.  
3. **Tiger Tiles**: 2 VP each (unused).  
4. **Trophy Track**: Score VP based on shield value reached.  
5. **Built Outposts**: 1/2/3/4/5 outposts = 1/3/6/10/15 VP.  
6. **Unbuilt Outposts**: 1 VP each.  
7. **Coins**: 1 VP per 2 coins (rounded down).  
8. **Horses and Furs**: Convert every 5 horses → 1 fur. Then 1 VP per 2 furs (rounded down).  
9. **Story Track**: 1 VP per 4 story points (rounded down).  
Total all VP. Highest wins. Tie: furthest Cossack wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Player Order**: Based on Cossack position (rightmost = ahead). When moving, place Cossack to left of others on same tile.  
- **Fur Values**: Exact match required unless paying coin to adjust. Two value 3 ≠ value 6.  
- **Tiger Tile**: Highest value fur. Can be used as wild (spend it). Worth 2 VP at end.  
- **Outposts**: Max 1 per region. Built from supply. Enables advanced actions remotely.  
- **Song Tile Reward at 12**: Can use once per turn if story token lands on or passes 12.  
- **Asymmetrical Player Boards (Side “b”)**:  
  - Red: Every other trophy step free.  
  - Yellow: Trophy track gives 2/5/9/14 end-game VP.  
  - Blue: Shorter trophy track.  
  - Green: Extra coins on trophy progression.  
  - Special Rule: At story 12, may spend story points = next trophy fur value to advance trophy (no fur cost).  
- **Solo Mode (vs. Ivan)**:  
  - Setup: 2-player rules, Ivan as opponent.  
  - Automa deck controls Ivan. Cards dictate movement, actions.  
  - Ivan never pays horses. 5 horses = 1 VP.  
  - Ivan draws 1 fur from bag (no draw 2 keep 1).  
  - Value 8 fur = wild for Ivan + 2 story points.  
  - Coin = wild fur for Ivan.  
  - When lacking fur, spends: value 8 fur → coin → tiger tile.  
  - Song tiles: Ivan takes most expensive he can afford.  
  - Added difficulty: Gain coin when unable to perform action or when drawing trade-matching fur. Use Katyusha board for higher VP rewards.
