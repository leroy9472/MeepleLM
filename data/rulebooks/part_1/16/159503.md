### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions  
- Most Roles have **4 actions per turn** (Cyborg has 5, Ensign has 4).  
- Actions are spent to:

  - Move (via Teleporter or normal movement)  
  - Heal  
  - Manufacture or fire Torpedoes  
  - Draw Battle Plans  
  - Transfer Skills  
  - Kill Hostile Aliens  
- Actions do not carry over.

#### Skills & Discounts  
- Skill types: **Command, Engineering, Science, Tactical**.  
- Role cards list **Skill discounts** (e.g., 2 Tactical). These reduce cost of matching actions.  
- If discounts are insufficient, discard Skill cards to cover the difference.  
- **Discounts can be used repeatedly** and never deplete.  
- **Skill discounts apply when overriding Alerts**.  

#### Hand Size  
- Varies by Role (e.g., Counselor = 8, Ensign = 4).  
- Includes **Skill and Tool cards only**.  
- **Battle Plans do not count** toward hand size.  
- If over hand size, **discard immediately** down to limit.

- Triggered by Alerts or effects.  
- **Injured pawn is tipped sideways**.  
- **Limited actions available:**  
  - Move  
  - Kill Hostile Aliens

#### Repairing Systems  
- Spend actions and Skills listed on **Offline side** of card.

- **Shields & Jump Core:** Slide yellow bar up one level per repair.  
  - Shields: 2 actions, 2 Tactical → +10%
