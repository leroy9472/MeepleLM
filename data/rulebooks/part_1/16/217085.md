### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Players take turns clockwise.  
- Each turn has two phases:  
  1. **Delver Phase (Optional):** Play any number of Delver cards from hand.  
  2. **Excavation Phase (Mandatory):** Roll one die on a Ruin card.  
- After any die roll, reroll, or card play, immediately check if any Ruin is claimed.  
- Game ends when all Ruins cards have been claimed.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Player Turn  
**Delver Phase:**  
- Play any number of Delver cards.  
- Cards resolve immediately and are discarded.  
- Cards may trigger rerolls or modify dice.  

**Excavation Phase:**  
- Choose one die from your pool (or retrieve one from a Ruin if all are in play).  
- Declare which Ruin you are rolling on.  
- Roll the die and place it on the Ruin card.  
- If the result is 1, 2, or 3:  
  - Take 1 Stone from the Ruin (your choice of color), OR  
  - If no Stones remain, draw randomly from the bag.  
  - Immediately place the Stone in your tableau.  

#### Claiming a Ruin  
- After any die is rolled, rerolled, or card played, check if the **total** of all dice on any Ruin ≥ its top-left claim value.  
- If so, the Ruin is claimed by the player with the **highest single die** on it.  
- **Tiebreakers:**  
  1. Higher number of die faces ("bigger die") wins.  
  2. If dice are same type, compare next-highest dice.  
  3. Missing dice count as 0.  
  4. If tie remains unbroken:  
     - Ruin is discarded (returned to box)  
     - All players draw 1 Delver card per die they had on the Ruin  

**After Claim:**  
- Winner takes the Ruin card (face-up in their collection).  
- All dice are returned to their owners.  
- Remaining Stones go back to the bag.  
- Draw a new Ruin card to replace it (if available) and seed with Stones.  

#### Building Wonders  
- Stones must be placed in your tableau immediately upon acquisition.  
- Stones must connect to your existing network.  
- A **Wonder** is formed by completing a **hexagonal ring of 6 Stones** with an empty center.  
- Place a Wonder token in the center:  
  - **Greater Wonder:** All 6 Stones same color (random draw)  
  - **Lesser Wonder:** Mixed colors (random draw)  
  - **Named Wonder:** Only if ring matches specific formula (replace Greater/Lesser)  
- **Stone Reuse:** A Stone may be part of multiple rings.  
- **No Rearranging:** Once placed, Stones cannot be moved unless a card effect allows it.  

**Named Wonders:**  
- Each has a unique construction formula (e.g., 3 of one color + 3 of another).  
- White Stone icons with "?" = any color.  
- Connected white icons without "?" = must be different colors.  
- When built, place card in play area and gain its effect.  

#### End of Age  
- When the Ruins Deck is exhausted, the next card revealed is the **End of Age** card.  
- Reveal and resolve it like a normal Ruin:  
  - If a Ruin: Add to table, place Stones  
  - If an Event: Follow instructions  
- Game continues until all Ruins (including End of Age) are claimed.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends when the last Ruin is claimed. Score as follows:

1. **Ruin Sets:**  
   - Reveal hidden Ruin card.  
   - Score for sets of same-color Ruins:  
     - 1: 2 pts  
     - 2: 6 pts  
     - 3: 12 pts  
     - 4: 20 pts  
     - 5: 30 pts  
   - **Bonus:** +5 pts for each complete set of one of each color (can score multiple times).  
   - Note: "City of Ash" and "City of Gold" are colorless.

2. **Wonders:**  
   - Flip over all Wonder tokens and add printed points.  
   - Named Wonders may have special scoring (per card).  

3. **Wonder Count Bonus:**  
   - +5 pts if you built **3 or more Wonders** (one-time bonus).  

**Total all points. Highest score wins.**

#### Tiebreaker  
- Compare number of Ruins with the **highest claim value**.  
- If tied, compare next-highest claim value, etc.  
- Example:  
  - Red: 17, 15, 9, 9, 9, 9  
  - Blue: 17, 13, 13, 13  
  - Green: 17, 15, 15  
  - All tied at 17s → Green wins (more 15s)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **No dice available?** Roll one of your dice already on a Ruin (can reroll on same or different Ruin).  
- **Can I start multiple rings?** Yes. Rings must be connected, but you don’t need to complete one before starting another.  
- **Reroll a 1–3?** Yes — gain another Stone (from Ruin or bag).  
- **Run out of Stones?** No more Stones can be gained; low rolls yield nothing.  
- **Delver card modifiers:** Apply only to the roll they’re played for (e.g., Reading the Stones does not carry over to rerolls).  
- **Order of card resolution:** Player chooses order when playing multiple cards.  
- **Named Wonders:** Formula depends on stone types, not positions.  
- **Stone color tie for scoring?** Choose one color to count (e.g., Fountain of Reflection).
