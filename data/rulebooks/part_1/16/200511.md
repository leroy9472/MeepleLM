### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each season consists of 6 phases:  
1. **Actions**: Players take turns placing Workers on action spaces.  
2. **Combat**: Simultaneous combat resolution per player.  
3. **Flags**: Award Flag to highest Gold non-sacked player.  
4. **Income & Turn Order**: Gain Gold per Castle Piece; reorder by Gold (lowest first).  
5. **Harvest & Feast**: Gain Food from Farms; feed Soldiers (Food or Gold).  
6. **Refresh Board**: Advance Season; refill cards, reset tokens, return Workers.  

Repeat for 7 seasons. Final scoring follows Season 7.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Combat Phase Steps  

**1) Preparation**  
1. Position Troops (Soldiers/Mercenaries) on Walls or inside Castle.  
2. Reveal all Invader Cards. Place Invaders on adjacent fields based on card orientation and highest of current Gold or Threat Tracker level.  
3. Reveal Siege Card. Place Siege Token on relevant field. If "Leader", player with most Gold adds Swordsmen equal to current Season number. If "All", all players do so.  
4. If Siege Card has damage symbol (e.g., Catapult), Castle takes damage from relevant direction. Damage priority:  
   i. Wood Turret with least Wood cubes (player chooses if tied)  
   ii. Stone Turret with least Stone cubes (player chooses if tied)  
   iii. Other Turret  
   iv. Wall  
   - 1 damage removes 1 resource cube to Stockpile.  
   - If no cubes remain, piece is destroyed (except Stone Turret → Flame Token). All Troops on it move inside Castle.  
5. Farms with Invaders and no Protect Token are Razed:  
   - Level 2 → Level 1  
   - Level 1 → Flame Token (produces no Food)  
6. Use Move Tokens to move Troops (1 per Token). Discard all Move Tokens afterward.  

**2) Archery (simultaneous)**  
- Each Troop on Wall: 1 damage to adjacent Invaders  
- Each Wood Turret: 1 damage to Invaders in both adjacent fields  
- Each Flameless Stone Turret: 2 damage to Invaders in both adjacent fields  
- Each Archer Invader: 1 damage to Troops on adjacent Wall  
- 1 damage kills 1 Invader/Mercenary (return to supply) or wounds 1 Soldier (to Infirmary)  

**3) Movement**  
- Invaders in field without adjacent Wall move inside Castle.  
- If Siege Card has Ladder/Siege Tower, listed number of Invaders bypass Wall and move inside Castle.  
- Move Troops freely between Walls and Castle interior.  

**4) Melee (simultaneous)**  
1. Each Invader outside Castle: 1 damage to adjacent Wall (ignore Turrets).  
   - Remove 1 resource cube to Stockpile.  
   - If Wall has no cubes and takes damage, it is destroyed; all Troops on it move inside Castle.  
2. Each Troop and Invader inside Castle: 1 damage to one opposing unit (simultaneously).  
   - Soldiers on Walls do not participate.  

**5) Check Outcome**  
- **No Invaders**: Survived. Discard Mercenaries.  
- **Invaders outside only**: Repeat from Archery.  
- **Invaders inside Castle, no Troops inside**: Sacked:  
  i. All Soldiers Wounded (to Infirmary), all Mercenaries killed  
  ii. All Invaders removed  
  iii. Damage/Wound 2 non-starting Buildings/Refugees (any combination)  
  iv. Reduce Gold to small red number on current position  
  v. Gain 2 Mercenaries and 1 Grey Villager Worker  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
At end of Season 7:  
- Score Gold from:  
  - Non-damaged Buildings  
  - Non-wounded Refugees  
  - All Flag Tokens  
  - 1 Gold per Farm without Flame Token (Level 1 or 2)  
  - Completed Secret Objectives (tied for "most" counts if at least one)  
- Most Gold wins. Tiebreaker: most Flag Tokens.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Stone Turrets**: Cannot be destroyed; take Flame Token when damaged with no cubes. Repair costs 2 Stone (removes Flame).  
- **Move Tokens**: Can be used only in Combat; discarded after use.  
- **Sacking**: Only triggered if no Troops are inside Castle (Walls don’t count).  
- **Gold Leader**: Determined before Combat; used for Siege "Leader" effects and Flag award.  
- **Threat Tracker**: Sets minimum threat level; if player’s Gold is below it, use Threat level for Invader/Siege strength.  
- **Ties in Gold for Flags**: All tied players get 1-Gold Flag.  
- **Wounded Soldiers**: Can be healed at Barracks (1 Food) or Infirmary (up to 4).  
- **Mercenaries**: Leave at end of each Season unless Sacked (gain 2).
