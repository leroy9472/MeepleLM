9. Each player receives 3 gold.  
10. Reveal Era I civilization cards. Player with lowest-numbered card becomes first player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game consists of **four Eras**. Each Era has **five phases**:

#### A. Era Setup  
1. Reveal all Wonder cards of the current Era.  
2. Reveal as many Building cards as there are players.  
3. Each player reveals their current-era civilization card and chooses to keep it or retain the previous one. Discard the unused card.  
   - Immediate effects (lightning icon) trigger once upon selection.  
   - Permanent effects last while the card is active.  
4. The player with the lowest-numbered civilization card becomes the first player.

#### B. Expand the Map  
In player order:  
1. Draw and place one continent tile:  
   - Era I: 3-square tile  
   - Eras II–IV: 2-square tile  
   - Must be adjacent to existing land/sea (land to land, sea to sea)  
   - May rotate freely  
   - May cover printed islands; colonists on covered spaces return to their capitals  
   - Cannot stack tiles  
2. Place or move capital:  
   - Era I: Must place on newly placed tile, active side up  
   - Eras II–IV: May move capital to a space on the new tile  
   - Move all colonists from the old capital location to the new one  
   - Capital covers and blocks the resource symbol beneath it  

#### C. Player Actions  
Players take turns clockwise, each performing **one action per turn** until all have started a Golden Age. Actions:

1. **Explorer** (uses upright colonist):  
   - Move one colonist (orthogonal only) up to range allowed by current tech (Wheel=1, Carriage=2, Rail=3, Aviation=any)  
   - May exit left/right edge and re-enter on opposite side (world wraps horizontally)  
   - If colonist ends on uncontrolled resource (game, wheat, rock, gem), take control and gain gold per relevant tech/card  
   - After movement, may found a city on a continent square without city/capital:  
     - Place 1 cube (or 2 if 'Construction' is developed)  
     - Gain gold per 'Barter' or 'Commerce'  
     - Relocate cubes from map if needed  
   - Lay colonist down at end  

2. **Builder** (uses upright colonist):  
   - Lay colonist on agora  
   - Take one face-up Building card and place on free building space  
     - 'Writing' unlocks space 2; 'Architecture' unlocks space 3  
   - If no space, discard any building (even used) to make room  
   - May have duplicate buildings  

3. **Artist** (uses upright colonist):  
   - Lay colonist on agora  
   - Gain 3 VPs  

4. **Soldier** (uses upright colonist):  
   - May move colonist to a space with opponent’s colonist(s) or city (not capital)  
   - Pay gold equal to next free space on invasion track (1st=2G, 2nd=4G, 3rd=6G, 4th=8G)  
   - Remove opponent’s cube(s) to their reserve; return their colonists to capital  
   - Draw one random glory tile and place face down on invasion track  
   - May immediately found a city on the space  
   - Lay colonist down  
   - Limited to 4 attacks per player per game  
   - *Exception*: With 'Rocketry', attack without moving a colonist  

5. **Build a Wonder**:  
   - Pay gold cost (some civilizations reduce cost)  
   - Place card next to player board  
   - Trigger instant effect (if any)  
   - No limit on number of wonders  

6. **Activate a Building or Wonder**:  
   - Use one card with activation symbol (🌀)  
   - Execute effect and flip card to show used  
   - May be reactivated in future eras after reset  

7. **Develop a Technology**:  
   - Pay gold cost on tile  
   - Previous tech in the same row must be developed  
   - Place tile face down; benefit applies immediately  
   - Remove cube (if any) to reserve  
   - Some techs make prior ones obsolete (e.g., Rail replaces Carriage)  

8. **Start a Golden Age**:  
   - Only if no upright colonists remain on map  
   - Flip capital to Golden Age side  
   - Pass for all remaining turns in the era  
   - Receive 2 gold at start of each subsequent round  
   - First player to do so chooses the current History’s Judgement card  

#### D. End of the Era  
- Triggered when **all players** have started a Golden Age (except Era IV)  
- **Era IV**: Triggered when **first player** starts a Golden Age  
- All players score VPs based on the selected History’s Judgement card  

#### E. Prepare for Next Era  
(Skipped after Era IV)  
1. Discard unclaimed building and wonder cards  
2. Discard History’s Judgement card  
3. Flip all capitals to active side  
4. Flip all used (face-down) building/wonder cards face up  
5. Stand all colonists on map upright  
6. Return colonists from agora to their capital  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Movement**: Colonists move orthogonally; range depends on tech (Wheel, Carriage, Rail, Aviation)  
- **Resource Control**: Gain gold when first placing colonist/city on resource (game, wheat, rock, gem); multiple players may share control  
- **Attacks**: Limited to 4 per player; pay increasing cost; gain glory tile  
- **Golden Age**: Ends player’s actions; provides 2G per round; triggers era end  
- **Technology Tree**: Linear progression per row; obsolete techs lose benefits  
- **Civilization Powers**: Immediate or permanent bonuses (e.g., free techs, gold, movement)  
- **Wonders & Buildings**: Provide instant, permanent, or activatable effects  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Triggered when first player starts a Golden Age in **Era IV**. After all other players take one final action:  
- **Gold**: 1 VP per 3 gold (round down)  
- **Technologies**: VPs shown on back of developed tech tiles  
- **Glory Tiles**: VPs on back of tiles collected via attacks  
- **Future Technology Cards**: 8 VPs if condition met (e.g., most gold, most techs, etc.); no points for ties  
- **Spiral Minaret**: 2 VPs per developed tech in last two columns of player board  
- **History’s Judgement**: Score as in previous eras  

**Tiebreaker**: Most cities on the map. If still tied, share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Founding a city with relocated cubes**: Still gain gold from 'Barter'/'Commerce'  
- **Relocating cubes**: Can take from any of your cities; can remove one cube from a 2-cube city  
- **Discarding buildings**: Can discard a used (face-down) building to build a new one; new one can be activated same turn  
- **Roman Empire & Arabia**: Can use "build without colonist" ability multiple times per era  
- **Portugal**: Gains 3G each time a colonist crosses left/right map edge, even with Aviation; only once per movement  
- **Resource control**: Gained when first placing colonist/city; no gain if already controlling  
- **Attack with Rocketry**: No colonist movement needed; must still pay attack cost and can found city after  
- **Map edges**: Left and right edges are connected (wraparound); top and bottom are not  
- **Capital movement**: Must place on or move to newly placed tile; covers and blocks resource
