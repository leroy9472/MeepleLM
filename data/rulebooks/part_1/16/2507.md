## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Liberté*, players shape the political landscape of revolutionary France (1789–1799), competing through provincial elections, battles, and faction control to gain Victory Points (VPs). The goal is to win by earning the most VPs after four turns, or by triggering one of two sudden-death conditions: a Radical Electoral Landslide (17+ red votes) or a Royalist Counter-Revolution (7 Fleur-de-lis provinces controlled by Royalists in turns 3–4).

### 2. Components
- 1 Game Board: Divided into 6 regions with 27 provinces; includes Fleur-de-lis (Royalist) provinces, VP provinces, Battle Box, Election Track, Victory Point Track, Player Order Track, Turn Track.
- 110 Cards: A-Set (Moderate/Royalist-leaning), B-Set (Radical-leaning). Three types:
  - Personality Cards: Show faction blocks (red/blue/white), value (1–3), and may have Cannon, General, or Sans-Culottes symbols.
  - Club Cards: Wild cards (neutral background), have Cannon symbol, place 1 block anywhere.
  - Special Cards: Trigger events (e.g., Guillotine, Terror).
- 82 Faction Blocks: 30 red (Radicals), 28 blue (Moderates), 24 white (Royalists).
- 120 Control Tokens: 20 per player (6 colors), used for stack control, Battle Box, and Presence in Government.
- 3 Election Markers (red, blue, white): Track votes on Election Track.
- 1 Turn Marker, 1 Province Marker.
- 6 Player Aids.

### 3. Setup

3. Randomly determine starting player; assign player order clockwise on Player Order Track.
4. Shuffle B-set cards and place face-down. Shuffle A-set and deal 7 cards to each player. Place remaining A-set on top of B-set to form full deck.
5. Reveal top 3 cards next to deck.
6. Sort Faction Blocks by color; place 2 of each color under Turn 2 space on Turn Track (to be returned at start of Turn 2).
7. Place Election Markers on 0-space of Election Track.
8. Place Turn Marker on Turn 1.
9. Place Province Marker next to block supplies.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of 4 turns has 5 phases (skipping Phase 1 and 2 on Turn 1):

1. **Determine Player Order** (Turns 2–4): Reorder by descending VP total. Break ties randomly.
2. **Refresh Hand** (Turns 2–4): Return personal display cards to hand. Players may discard any number, then refill hand to 7 cards (from face-up or deck).
3. **Action Phase**: Players take actions in order until one faction block supply is exhausted (last full round completes).
