### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **10 rounds**. Each round proceeds as follows:  

1. **Round Start**: Start player moves the top Tower tile from the Oath Charter to the Cathedral. This tile may modify rules for the round (see Tower Effects).  
2. **Player Turns (in clockwise order)**:
   - **Optional Card Play**: May play 1 card from hand at any time during the turn.
   - **Draw & Push Action Tile**:
     - Draw 1 Action tile from the bag.
     - Optionally, spend 1 Ulm Sparrow to exchange it with a tile from the Loading Docks.
     - Push the tile into any row or column of the 3×3 Cathedral grid that is not blocked (i.e., has fewer than 4 tiles).
     - The tile pushed out (if any) goes to the corresponding side of the grid.
   - **Blocked Grid**: If all 6 rows/columns are blocked (each has 4 tiles), return all pushed-out tiles to the bag before continuing.
   - **Perform Actions**: Carry out the 3 actions from the **inner 3×3 grid** of the row or column just pushed, in any order. Actions are optional and may be skipped if unaffordable.
   - **Pass Bag**: Pass the Action tile bag to the next player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action Types (by Tile Color)  
- **Gray (Money)**: Take 1 coin from the supply.  
  - *Mint Master descendant*: Take 2 coins instead.  
- **White (Clear-away)**: Take all pushed-out Action tiles from one side of the Cathedral grid.  
  - If 2 white tiles are activated, may do this twice.  
  - *Abbot descendant*: After a Clear-away, take 1 additional tile from the Loading Docks.  
- **Brown (Card)**: Choose one:
  - **Buy a Card**: Discard 2 Action tiles to the bag and draw 1 card.  
    - If both tiles are the same color, draw 2 cards, choose 1, discard the other face-up.  
    - *Councilman descendant*: May choose 1 of 2 cards even with different-colored tiles.  
  - **Play a Card**: Play a card from hand for its immediate (top) effect or lay it face-up for endgame (bottom) effect.  
- **Turquoise (River)**: Move barge forward 1 unoccupied space on the Danube (skip occupied spaces).  
  - Last 4 river spaces grant immediate bonuses: coin, Ulm Sparrow, tile from Loading Docks, or card.  
  - *Barge Driver descendant*: Move 1 extra space when activating River action.  
- **Orange (Seal)**: Pay 2 coins to place 1 seal in an unoccupied space in a city quarter adjacent to your barge. Gain that quarter’s privilege.  
  - Cannot perform if out of seals (max 13).  
  - *1st Ulm Chronicle card*: May place a seal by paying only 1 coin.  

#### City Quarter Privileges
