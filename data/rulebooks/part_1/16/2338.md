### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players alternate turns in the following sequence:

#### A. Production Phase  
- Roll the yellow die.
- If a player owns a Colony that matches the die roll, they gain 1 resource of that type.
- Only one Colony per player produces per roll, even if multiple match.
- Use Resource Arrows to track holdings.

> **Storage Limits**: Maximum 2 resources per type unless upgraded by Logistics Module(s). Science Points max at 4.

#### B. Flight Phase  
- Add die result to total Booster dots currently face up on your ship. This is your maximum flight distance (speed).
- Choose one of the four Sector stacks to fly through.
- Opponent reveals cards from the chosen stack one at a time (do **not** reveal Pirate cards).
- You may spend Action Points to perform actions while exploring:
  - Base: 2 Action Points (increased by Command Modules).
  - Each action consumes 1 Action Point.
  - Available actions:
    1. **Buy/Sell Resources or Science Points** at a Trade Planet or Galactic Library.
    2. **Found a Colony or Trading Post** by deploying a C or T Ship.
    3. **Complete a Mission** at an Adventure Planet if requirements are met.
- Flight ends when:
  - You use all Action Points,
  - Reach flight speed limit,
  - Decide to stop early,
  - Lose a Pirate encounter.
- After flight, opponent reshuffles used Sector cards and returns them to form a full 10-card stack.

> **Card Replacement Rule**: Whenever a card is removed from a Sector stack (e.g., claimed for a Colony), replace it immediately with the top card from the Reserved deck (Adventure Planets), placed face up at a 45° angle to indicate origin.

#### C. Trading and Building Phase  
You may:
- Use up to 2 of your Trading Posts this turn.
  - At each, buy or sell any amount of resources (within storage limits).
  - Must complete all trades with one post before moving to another.
- Trade directly with opponent.
  - Opponent **cannot refuse** if you have a Trade Module (Level I or II).
- Build any number of items:
  - **Colony Ship**: Cost 1, 1, 1 (three different resources); requires hanger space.
  - **Trade Ship**: Cost 1, 1, 1; requires hanger space.
  - **Booster**:
    - Level I: 2 resources
    - Level II: 2, 1 (use single red dot side first)
  - **Cannon**:
    - Level I: 2 resources
    - Level II: 2, 1 (use single red dot side first)
  - **Level I Module**: 1, 1, 1 — flip face up to activate.
  - **Level II Module**: 1, 1, 2 — must already have corresponding Level I Module; stack on top. Grants 1 Victory Point.

> Building does not require Action Points and can be done freely during this phase.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Pirates  
- When a Pirate card is revealed during flight:
  - Do **not** reveal the card to the active player.
  - Read aloud: “A Pirate attacks!” and state its strength (number).
  - Player chooses:
    - **Pay the cost** (in Astro) to avoid combat → continue flight.
    - **Fight** (or if unable to pay).
- Combat:
  - Opponent rolls blue die + Pirate’s strength = Pirate’s total.
  - Player rolls blue die + sum of face-up Cannon dots = Player’s total.
  - Player wins ties.
  - If player wins:
    - Claim rewards (Astro, resources, etc.) as shown on Pirate card.
    - Continue flight.
  - If Pirate wins:
    - Flight ends immediately.
    - Apply penalties (loss of resources, ships, etc.).
- Fighting or fleeing **does not count** as an Action.

#### Modules  
- Must build Level I before upgrading to Level II.
- Level II Modules provide enhanced abilities and grant 1 Victory Point.
- Modules remain face down until built (flipped).

#### Special Victory Point Cards  
- **Friend of the People**: Awarded to first player to earn 3 Friendship Points. Worth 1 Victory Point. Transfers if opponent gains more Friendship Points. If tied, return to side.
- **Hero of the People**: Awarded to first player to earn 3 Fame Points. Worth 1 Victory Point. Transfers if opponent gains more Fame Points. If tied, return to side.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Victory Points are earned by:
- Completing missions (via Galactic Council cards)
- Building Level II Modules (1 VP each)
- Claiming Special Cards: Friend/Hero of the People (1 VP each)
- Other mission or event rewards

**Game End**: The game ends immediately when any player reaches **10 Victory Points**. That player wins.

> Note: Earlier version referenced 12 VP; corrected to **10 VP** based on consistent rulebook and Italian quick reference.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: What happens when a Sector stack runs out of cards during flight?**  
A: Cards are replaced instantly from the Reserved deck whenever a card is removed. The stack always has 10 cards during play.

**Q: Can I use more than 2 Trading Posts per turn?**  
A: No. Maximum of 2 per turn.

**Q: Do Pirates count as explored cards?**  
A: No. Pirate encounters are resolved immediately but do not consume an Action Point.

**Q: Can I trade during Flight Phase?**  
A: Yes — buying/selling at Trade Planets or the Galactic Library is an available action during Flight.

**Q: Can I build during Flight Phase?**  
A: No. Building only occurs in the Trading and Building Phase.

**Q: Can I use both my own and opponent’s Trading Posts?**  
A: No. Only your own.

**Q: When replacing a claimed card (Colony, Trading Post, etc.), is it face up or down?**  
A: Face up (standard). Variant: face down.

**Q: Do Action Points carry over between turns?**  
A: No. They reset each turn based on Command Modules.
