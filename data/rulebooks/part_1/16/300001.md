## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Renature*, players take on the role of nature lovers working to restore a polluted valley by populating the banks of a brook with animals and plants. The objective is to score the most Victory Points (VP) through strategic placement of dominoes and plants, area control, and efficient use of special actions. The game ends when all players have placed or discarded all their dominoes. The player with the highest total VP after final scoring wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most Area Tokens wins; if still tied, the victory is shared.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Game Board: Features 18 Areas (brown soil spaces) and a brook network (white spaces) where dominoes are placed.  
- 4 Player Boards: Each has a balloon side (for 3–4 players) and a paraglider side (used in pairs for 2 players).  
- 55 Dominoes: Each shows two animals (10 unique animals, all combinations appear exactly once).  
- 74 Plants: 4 types (Turf = 1, Bush = 2, Pine = 3, Oak = 4) in 5 colors (4 player colors + 1 neutral).  
- 21 Area Tokens: Each has front-side Main and Minor Points matching an Area’s size; back-side points are secret until endgame.  
- 4 Score Markers: One per player color, used on the scoring track.  
- 30 Cloud Tokens: Used for special actions (Cloud Actions).  
- 1 Joker Marker (green): Indicates the current wild animal.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Game Board**: Place in the center.  
2. **Player Boards**:  
   - 3–4 players: Each chooses a color, takes one matching player board, places it balloon side up.  
   - 2 players: Each takes two boards (both black or both white), places them side-by-side paraglider side up to form a continuous landscape.  
3. **Plants**: Each player places plants (own color + neutral) on all corresponding spaces on their player board. In 4-player games, ignore spaces marked with the 3-player icon. Return extras to the box.  
4. **Joker Marker**: Place on the Butterfly space.  
5. **Area Tokens**: Shuffle face-up (Main Points visible). Place one token on each of the 18 Areas so that the Main Points match the Area’s size. Return the three leftover tokens (sizes 3, 7, 13) to the box unrevealed.  
6. **Cloud Tokens on Board**: Place total of 5 Cloud Tokens on the 4 designated spaces as indicated (number per space shown on board).  
7. **Player Clouds**: Each player places 6 Cloud Tokens on their board’s cloud spaces. Return extras to the box.  
8. **Dominoes**: Shuffle face-down. Deal:  
   - 4 players: 13 each (3 leftover, return to box)  
   - 3 players: 18 each (1 leftover)  
   - 2 players: 26 each (3 leftover)  
   Each player places their dominoes face-down as a Reserve. Draw 3 to form a hidden hand.  
9. **Starting Player**: The player who last walked in nature starts. They place their score marker on space 4. Clockwise, others place on 3, 2, 1 respectively.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds clockwise. On a player’s turn, perform the following steps in order:  
1. **Place or Return 1 Domino**  
2. **(Optional) Place 1 Plant** (only if a domino was placed)  
3. **Score Points and Check for Area Scoring**  
4. **Refill Hand** (if reserve has dominoes)  
Additionally, **Cloud Actions** may be taken at any time during the turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Step 1: Place or Return 1 Domino  
- Choose one domino from hand and place it face-up on two adjacent **Brook spaces**.  
- Dominoes must not cover Area (soil) spaces or extend beyond the grid.  
- At least one half must be orthogonally adjacent to:  
  - A matching animal on an existing domino, OR  
  - One of the four Starting Spaces (no adjacency required).  
- **Joker Animal Rule**: The animal under the Joker Marker is wild. Any animal can be adjacent to it, and it can be adjacent to any animal.  
- All adjacent animals must match (using Joker if applicable). If any mismatch exists, placement is invalid.  
- If unable or unwilling to place, **discard one domino to the box**.  
- If hand is empty, skip turn.

#### Step 2: Place 1 Plant (Optional)  
- Only if a domino was placed.  
- Choose any plant from your player board (your color or neutral).  
- Place it on a **vacant Area (soil) space** orthogonally adjacent to the placed domino.  
- If an Area Token occupies the space, slide it to another vacant space in the same Area.  
- If the space has Cloud Tokens:  
  - Take them and place on your board’s cloud spaces.  
  - If no free cloud spaces: either perform a Cloud Action to free space **immediately**, or lose excess tokens to the box.  
- If no adjacent vacant Area spaces, this step is skipped.

#### Step 3: Score Points and Check for Area Scoring  
**A. Score for Placed Plant**  
- Gain **1 VP** for the plant itself.  
- Gain **1 VP** for each plant in the same Area with **equal or lower value** (Turf=1, Bush=2, Pine=3, Oak=4).  
- Move score marker accordingly.

**B. Check for Area Closure**  
An Area is **closed** if every **orthogonally adjacent Brook space** is either:  
- Covered by a domino, OR  
- Isolated (no adjacent free Brook space to place a full domino).  
*Diagonally adjacent spaces are ignored.*

**If one or more Areas are closed this turn, trigger Area Scoring for each:**

1. **Sum total value** of plants for each **color** (including neutral) in the Area.  
2. **Cancel ties**: Any colors tied in total value are treated as **not present**.  
3. **Award Points from Area Token**:  
   - If **no color remains**, no points awarded.  
   - If **only one player color remains**, that player scores **both Main and Minor Points**.  
   - If **neutral is the only color**, no points awarded.  
   - If **multiple colors remain**:  
     - Highest value (if player color): scores **Main Points**  
     - Second-highest value (if player color): scores **Minor Points**  
     - Neutral scores no points even if ranked.  
4. **Area Token Collection**: The player who **closed the Area** takes the token, places it face-up in front of them. They will score the **back-side points** at game end (keep secret until then).

#### Step 4: Refill Hand  
- Draw one domino from your Reserve to restore hand to 3.  
- If Reserve is empty, skip.  
- If hand is empty and no Reserve, skip future turns.

#### Cloud Actions (Unlimited, Any Time During Turn)  
Spend Cloud Tokens from your board (return to box):  
- **Change Joker Animal**: Spend **2 Clouds**. Move Joker Marker to any animal.  
- **Take Another Turn**: Spend **3 Clouds** at the end of your turn to take an immediate additional turn. Can chain multiple.  
- **Return Plant to Player Board**: Spend **Clouds equal to plant’s value** (Turf=1, Bush=2, Pine=3, Oak=4).  
  - Can return any plant of your color or **any neutral plant** from anywhere on the board (including closed areas).  
  - Must have a matching vacant space on your player board.  
  - In 4-player games, spaces marked with 3-player icon are **not available**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End**: When all players have no dominoes left (in hand or reserve).

**Final Scoring (in order):**  
1. **Score Remaining Areas**: For each Area still with an Area Token:  
   - Perform Area Scoring as in Step 3B.  
   - **Do not award** the Area Token — return it to the box after scoring.  
2. **Score Personal Bonuses**:  
   - **+1 VP** per Cloud Token remaining on your board.  
   - **−VP equal to value** of each plant still on your player board:  
     - Turf: −1, Bush: −2, Pine: −3, Oak: −4  
   - **Reveal and score** back-side points of all collected Area Tokens.  
3. **Determine Winner**:  
   - Highest total VP wins.  
   - Tie: Player with **most Area Tokens** wins.  
   - Still tied: Shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a plant on a space with an Area Token?**  
  Yes. Move the token to another vacant space in the same Area.  
- **What if I close multiple areas in one turn?**  
  Score each Area individually, in any order. You collect each Area Token.  
- **Can I perform Cloud Actions before placing a domino?**  
  Yes. Cloud Actions can be taken at any time during your turn.  
- **Can I return a plant from a closed area?**  
  Yes. Closed areas do not prevent plant retrieval via Cloud Action.  
- **Can neutral color win points in final scoring?**  
  No. Neutral can block scoring during Area Scoring, but players never gain points for neutral.  
- **What if I have no space for Cloud Tokens I pick up?**  
  You must either:  
  - Immediately perform a Cloud Action to free space, OR  
  - Lose excess Cloud Tokens to the box.  
- **Do I score for a plant if I place it in an already closed area?**  
  Yes. You still score the immediate placement points (1 + for lower/equal plants), but no Area Scoring is triggered unless you close a new area.  
- **Can I discard a domino even if I can place one?**  
  Yes. You may always choose to discard instead of placing.
