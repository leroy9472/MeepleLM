## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 1672, thirty pirates staged a legendary escape from the fortress of Cartagena. Players take on the role of pirate leaders trying to guide all six of their pirates through a secret underground passageway to freedom aboard a waiting sloop. The first player to get all six pirates onto the sloop wins the game.

### 2. Components  
- 6 modular board sections (to form a continuous passageway)  
- Pirate pawns (6 per player, in multiple colors)  
- Escape sloop (boat token)  
- Deck of symbol cards (featuring icons that match those on the board)  
- Arrow card (used only in Tortuga variant)  

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Assemble the six board sections into one continuous, connected passageway. The layout can be any shape as long as there are no gaps.  
2. Place the sloop at one end of the passageway.  
3. Each player chooses a color and places their six pirate pawns at the opposite end of the passageway from the sloop.  
4. Remove the arrow card from the deck. Shuffle the remaining cards and deal 6 to each player.  

#### Variant Setup:  
- **Tortuga Version**:  
  - Players place their 6 cards face-up in front of them (visible to all).  
  - Deal 12 cards face-up in a row on the table. Place the arrow card beneath or above this row, pointing right to indicate draw order.  
- **Jamaica Version**:  
  - Players keep their cards hidden.  
  - Place the remaining deck face-down near the board as the draw pile (stock).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Determine starting player (traditionally, the person who looks most like a pirate).  
2. Play proceeds clockwise.  
3. On a turn, a player performs **1 to 3 actions**, in any order and combination.  
4. After completing actions, the turn ends and the next player takes their turn.  
5. In the Tortuga variant, when the 12-card draw row is exhausted, replace it with 12 new cards (reshuffle if needed).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action A: Play a Card to Move Forward  
- Play one card from your hand.  
- Move one of your pirates forward along the passageway to the **next vacant space** that matches the symbol on the card.  
  - You may skip over occupied spaces.  
  - If no such space exists before the end of the passageway, the pirate moves directly onto the sloop.  
- You may not move backward or skip to a non-adjacent matching symbol unless it's the next available one.  

#### Action B: Move Backward to Draw Cards  
- Select one of your pirates and move it **backward** along the passageway.  
- Stop at the **first** space (moving backward) that contains **1 or 2 pirates** (any combination of your own or opponents').  
  - You **must** stop at the first occupied space; you cannot skip it.  
  - A space may never hold more than 3 pirates.  
- Draw:  
  - 1 card if the space has 1 other pirate (total of 2 including yours).  
  - 2 cards if the space has 2 other pirates (total of 3 including yours).  
- You do **not** draw a card for your own pirate.  

#### Action Combinations  
You may mix and match actions freely, as long as you perform 1–3 total actions.  
Example:  
- Move forward (play card),  
- Move backward (draw 1 card),  
- Move forward again (play another card).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is no scoring system.  
- The game ends **immediately** when a player moves their **sixth pirate** onto the sloop.  
- That player wins the game.  

---

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move forward past the sloop?**  
  No. Pirates move only toward the sloop. If a move would go beyond or past it, the pirate simply lands on it.  
- **Can I move a pirate backward into a space with 3 pirates?**  
  No. Maximum of 3 pirates per space. You cannot move into a full space.  
- **In Tortuga, do I draw cards one at a time from the row?**  
  Yes. Draw in the order indicated by the arrow (left to right). Only the first card is available at any time.  
- **In Jamaica, do I shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile?**  
  The sources do not specify a discard pile mechanism, so assume cards drawn are not reused unless house-ruled.  
- **Can I use the same pirate for multiple actions in one turn?**  
  Yes, as long as moves are legal (e.g., move one pirate forward, then another backward, then the first forward again).  
- **Do I have to use all 3 actions?**  
  No. You must perform **at least 1**, but may choose 1, 2, or 3.
