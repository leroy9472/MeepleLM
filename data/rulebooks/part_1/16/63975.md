## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Mountain Goats*, players compete to climb numbered mountains (5–10), collect Point Tokens, and earn Bonus Points by reaching the summits first. The goal is to accumulate the most points by strategically grouping dice to move goats up mountains, claim tokens, and block opponents.

### 2. Components  
- 18 Mountain Cards:  
  - 4 each of mountains 5 and 6  
  - 3 each of mountains 7 and 8  
  - 2 each of mountains 9 and 10  
- 57 Point Tokens:  
  - 12 × 5 points  
  - 11 × 6 points  
  - 10 × 7 points  
  - 9 × 8 points  
  - 8 × 9 points  
  - 7 × 10 points  
- 4 dice  
- 24 Mountain Goats (6 per player; 4 players max)  
- 4 Bonus Point Tokens: 15, 12, 9, and 6 points

### 3. Setup  
1. Arrange the 18 mountain cards in ascending order (5 to 10), grouped by number.  
2. Stack Point Tokens on their corresponding mountain card:  
   - In a 4-player game: full stacks as listed.  
   - In a 3-player game: remove 1 Point Token from each mountain.  
   - In a 2-player game: remove 2 Point Tokens from each mountain.  
3. Place Bonus Point Tokens near the board.  
4. Each player places one goat at the base (first space) of each mountain.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On a turn:  
1. **Roll Dice**: Roll all 4 dice.  
   - If more than one "1" is rolled, the player may change all but one of them to any value.  
2. **Group Dice**: Divide the dice into any number of groups (including one group or all individual).  
   - Only groups summing to 5–10 allow movement.  
3. **Move Goats**: For each group:  
   - Move one of your goats **one space up** the mountain matching the group’s total.  
   - If your goat is already at the top:  
     - Take a Point Token from that mountain (if available).  
4. **Pass Dice**: After resolving all groups, pass the dice to the next player.

#### Special Movement Rules – Top of the Mountain  
- Multiple goats may occupy the same space **except** at the summit.  
- When a goat reaches the top:  
  - Take one Point Token from that mountain.  
  - Return any opponent’s goat already at the summit to the base of the mountain.  
- If a goat would move to a summit that is already occupied by another goat:  
  - The moving goat still reaches the top.  
  - The previously occupying goat is bumped back to the base.  
  - The moving player takes a Point Token.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Dice Grouping**: Any combination of dice can be grouped; unused dice are allowed.  
- **"1" Rule**: Only one "1" can remain as-is; extra "1"s can be rerolled or set to any value.  
- **Bonus Points**:  
  - Collecting at least one Point Token from **each of the six mountains** (5–10) earns a Bonus Point Token.  
  - Claim the highest-value Bonus Token still available.  
  - Additional complete sets earn additional Bonus Tokens (in descending order of value).  
- **Player Count Adjustments**:  
  - 3 players: Remove 1 Point Token per mountain.  
  - 2 players: Remove 2 Point Tokens per mountain.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Conditions** (trigger end after equal turns):  
- All Bonus Point Tokens have been claimed, **OR**  
- Point Tokens are depleted on **three or more mountains**.  

**Final Scoring**:  
- Sum all Point Tokens collected.  
- Add points from Bonus Tokens earned.  
- **Winning**:  
  1. Highest total score wins.  
  2. Tiebreaker 1: Most goats currently on mountain summits.  
  3. Tiebreaker 2: Goat on the highest-numbered mountain (compare highest occupied peaks).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip moving a goat even if I have a valid group?**  
  No — if you make a group summing to 5–10, you **must** move one of your goats up the corresponding mountain.  
- **Can I move multiple goats on the same mountain in one turn?**  
  Only if you have multiple groups matching that number. Each group moves one goat one space.  
- **What happens if a mountain runs out of Point Tokens?**  
  Goats can still climb it, but no tokens can be collected. Bumping still occurs.  
- **Can I use a group that sums to less than 5 or more than 10?**  
  No — such groups have no effect. Only totals 5–10 allow movement.
