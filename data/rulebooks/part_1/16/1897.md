### 3. Setup  
#### Initial Placement  
- Each player chooses a color and takes all components in that color.  
- Each player places:  
  - 2 Colonies  
  - 1 Spaceport (colony + spaceport ring)  
  on colony points around the Catanian Colony planets as shown in beginner setup.  
- Each player builds a free Colony Ship (transport + colony) and places it on an adjacent spaceport point.  
- VP markers are placed on "4" (2 colonies = 2 VP, 1 spaceport = 2 VP).  

#### Board Setup  
- Place production chits:  
  - Greek-letter chits → Catanian Colony planets, number side up  
  - Colored-spot chits → planets with matching colored spots, spot side up  
  - White-spot chits → placed near board, number side down (reserve)  
- Raw material cards: sort by type, place in cardbox compartments (Galactic Bank)  
- Shuffle 32 Event Cards → place face down near board  
- Friendship Cards: sort by race, lay face up next to corresponding Alien Homeworld  
- Friendship Discs: place on top of each Alien Homeworld  
- Fame Discs: place in component box  
- Dice and supply deck: prepare  

#### Mothership Assembly  
Each player assembles their mothership:  
- Mount endcap (color) on spike  
- Thread on initial fame disc  
- Attach upgrades during game as purchased  

#### Supply Deck  
- Take 12 cards from each of 5 raw material decks  
- Shuffle together → form supply deck next to cardbox  
- Each player draws 3 raw material cards  

#### 3-Player Game Note  
- Unused 4th color components (2 colonies, 1 spaceport) are placed as obstructions only; no functional role  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A turn consists of three phases in order:  
1. **Production Phase**  
2. **Trade and Building Phase**  
3. **Flight Phase**  

Play proceeds clockwise. The first player is determined by highest dice roll.

#### 1. Production Phase  
- Roll both dice  
- All players receive raw materials from colonies/spaceports on planets showing the rolled number  
- **If "7" is rolled**:  
  - Tribute from Earth: players with >7 raw material cards must discard half (round up)  
  - The player who rolled the 7 takes one random card from a player of their choice  

- **Card from Supply Deck**:  
  - If active player has <9 VPs, they draw one card from supply deck  
  - Forgotten draws can be claimed in Trade and Building Phase  
  - Once a Mothership Roll is made, this right is lost  
  - If supply deck is empty, shuffle 6 cards from each material deck to form new deck  

#### 2. Trade and Building Phase  
Player may perform actions in any order.

##### Trade with Other Players  
- Only between active player and others  
- Active player proposes trade (e.g., 2 Food for 1 Carbon)  
- Others may counter-offer; deal must involve active player  
- No trades between non-active players  

##### Trade with Galactic Bank  
- Exchange rate: 3:1 for all materials except Trade Goods (2:1)  
- Players with a Friendship Card from the Traders may improve bank rates  

##### Building  
Player may build any number of items if resources and components are available.

**1. Spaceships (Colony or Trade Ships)**  
- **Colony Ship**: pay cost, attach colony to transport  
- **Trade Ship**: pay cost, attach trade base to transport  
- Place new ship on vacant spaceport point adjacent to own spaceport  
- Cannot build if:  
  - All 3 transports are on board  
  - No colonies/trade bases left  
  - No vacant spaceport points  
- Ships built this turn may be launched immediately in Flight Phase  
- **First Spaceship**: transport with fewest beads on spike (used for event resolution)  

**2. Spaceports**  
- Upgrade existing colony by paying:  
  - 3 Carbon  
  - 2 Food  
- Attach spaceport ring to colony  
- Worth 2 VPs (includes 1 VP from colony)  
- Still produces only one resource per roll  
- Cannot be carried by transports  

**3. Mothership Upgrades**  
- Max 6 of each type per player  
- Costs (on quick reference card):  
  - Drive: increases ship speed by 1  
  - Cargo Ring: increases cargo capacity by 1  
  - Ship Cannon: increases combat strength  
- Attach to mothership in designated spots  

#### 3. Flight Phase  
If player has no ships on board, skip to next player.

##### Speed Determination (Mothership Roll)  
- Shake mothership upside down, then upright  
- Two beads fall into cylinder at base  
- Add values based on bead color (see quick reference card)  
- **Basic Speed = sum of bead values**  

Two outcomes:

**1. No Black Bead**  
- Basic speed = number shown  
- Add number of Drives (on mothership and from Wise Race friendship cards)  
- Total speed applies to all player’s ships  

**2. Black Bead Appears**  
- Event occurs before movement  
- Player to the left draws top event card and reads first question aloud (without showing card)  
- Active player chooses answer  
- Reader reveals result and implements it  
- **First Spaceship** is always affected if specified  
- Possible outcomes: gain or lose fame rings, other effects  
- **Fame Rings**: each 2 = 1 VP  
- Basic speed becomes **3**, then add Drive bonuses as above  
- Movement proceeds unless event blocks it  

**Special Event Cards**: Two cards titled "Zahn der Zeit" (Wear and Tear) affect **all players** and are resolved in full sequence  

##### Movement Rules  
- Unused movement points may be left unused  
- Ships may revisit space points  
- Ships may jump over occupied points (but cannot end there)  
- Only one spaceship per space point  

**Blockading Restrictions**:  
- Cannot end turn on another player’s spaceport point  
- Colony ship cannot end on trade point  
- Trade ship cannot end on trade point unless founding trade base  
- If colony ship ends on colony point without founding colony, must vacate next turn (if possible)  

##### Exploring Planets  
- Move ship to space adjacent to planet with face-down chit → reveal and inspect chit  
- Move to colony point → inspect chits of both adjacent planets  
- Return chits face down; no information shared  
- May continue moving if movement points remain  

##### Founding Colonies  
- End colony ship’s movement at vacant colony point  
- Reveal chits of adjacent planets  
- **Cannot found colony** if either adjacent planet is:  
  - Pirate Nest  
  - Ice Planet  
- If allowed:  
  - Detach transport → return to stock  
  - Turn both production chits face up  
  - Colony worth 1 VP  
  - Produces raw material when planet number is rolled  
- Colony cannot be converted back  

**3-Player Game Rule**: Only 2 colonies allowed per planetary system; one colony point must remain vacant  

##### Founding Trade Bases  
- Only at Alien Homeworlds  
- First player to reach trade point 1 with trade ship may establish base if:  
  - Trade ship is on trade point 1  
  - Mothership has at least 1 cargo ring  
- If successful:  
  - Detach transport → return to stock  
  - Take Friendship Disc (2 VPs)  
  - Choose one of 5 Friendship Cards from that race → gain immediate benefit  
- Subsequent bases:  
  - Trade point 2 → requires 2 cargo rings  
  - Trade point 3 → 3 cargo rings  
  - etc.  
- For each new base, player takes remaining Friendship Card of that race  
- **Ownership of Friendship Disc**:  
  - If another player has more trade bases at that homeworld, they take the disc  
  - In case of tie, player on lowest-numbered trade point keeps disc  

##### Pirates and Ice Planets  
- Colonies cannot be founded adjacent to Pirate Nest or Ice Planet  
- Can be neutralized:  

**Defeat Pirate Nest**:  
- Move any ship to adjacent space or colony point  
- Ship Cannon strength ≥ number on pirate chit (mothership + friendship cards)  
- Swap pirate chit with white-spot reserve chit  
- Keep pirate chit → worth 1 VP  

**Make Ice Planet Habitable**:  
- Move any ship to adjacent space or colony point  
- Mothership has ≥ cargo rings as number on ice planet chit  
- Swap with white-spot chit  
- Keep ice planet chit → worth 1 VP  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Victory Points**:  
  - Colony: 1 VP  
  - Spaceport: 2 VP (includes colony)  
  - Friendship Disc: 2 VP  
  - Pirate Nest or Ice Planet removed: 1 VP  
  - 2 Fame Rings: 1 VP  

- **Mothership Upgrades**:  
  - Drive → +1 speed  
  - Cargo Ring → +1 cargo capacity, required for trade bases  
  - Ship Cannon → combat strength vs pirates  

- **Event System**:  
  - Triggered by black bead  
  - Resolved by player to the left  
  - Always affects "First Spaceship"  
  - Can grant fame, damage, or other effects  

- **Trade Capacity**:  
  - Determined by cargo rings  
  - Required for founding trade bases at alien homeworlds  

- **Speed**:  
  - Determined by bead roll + drives  
  - All ships move same speed  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Track VPs using marker on VP track  
- Update immediately when VPs are gained or lost  
- **Game ends immediately** when a player reaches **15 VPs during their turn**  
- That player wins  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I trade during the Production Phase?**  
  No. Trading only allowed in Trade and Building Phase.  

- **Do I get a card from supply deck if I roll a 7 and have <9 VPs?**  
  Yes. The card draw is independent of the 7’s discard effect.  

- **What happens if I forget to draw my supply deck card?**  
  You may still draw it during the Trade and Building Phase. After starting the Flight Phase (Mothership Roll), you lose the right.  

- **Can I move multiple ships in the Flight Phase?**  
  Yes. All ships may be moved up to the determined speed, in any order.  

- **Can I build a spaceport on a colony that produces nothing?**  
  Yes. Any colony can be upgraded to a spaceport.  

- **Can I have more than one trade base per trade point?**  
  No. Each trade point (1–5) holds only one trade base.  

- **Can I lose a Friendship Disc after gaining it?**  
  Yes. If another player builds more trade bases at that homeworld, they take the disc.  

- **Do fame rings count toward winning?**  
  Yes. Every 2 fame rings = 1 VP.  

- **Can I explore and then found a colony in the same turn?**  
  Yes. Exploration can happen before founding, and movement points can carry over.
