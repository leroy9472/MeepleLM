## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Capital*, players build and develop districts of Warsaw over six historical epochs. The game simulates urban growth, economic development, and wartime destruction. Players compete to earn the most victory points (VP) through strategic tile placement, area development, and public building effects. The game ends after the 6th epoch, and the player with the highest VP total wins.

### 2. Components  
- Game board  
- 6 stacks of city tiles (numbered by epoch, I–VI)  
- 5 double-sided milestone tiles  
- Starting tiles (marked "S")  
- Coins (currency)  
- Mermaid pawns (player markers)  
- Victory point track (on board)  
- Player aid cards  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board in the center.  
2. Sort city tiles by the Roman numeral on the back into 6 stacks. Shuffle each stack and place them face-down on their matching spaces on the board.  
3. Randomly place the 5 milestone tiles on their designated board spaces, choosing one side at random per tile.  
4. Place coins in a bank next to the board.  
5. Each player receives:  
   - 1 starting tile (place with park and residential buildings visible)  
   - 6 coins  
   - 1 mermaid pawn (placed on 0 of VP track)  
6. Place player aid cards within reach.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **6 epochs**. Each epoch has the following structure:  
1. **Construction Phase** (draft and build 4 tiles)  
2. **Income Phase** (after all 4 tiles are resolved), which includes:  
   a. **War** (only after Epochs III and IV)  
   b. **Milestone Award**  
   c. **Scoring and Income**  

After Epoch VI, proceed to final scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Construction Phase  
- Shuffle the current epoch’s tile stack and deal 4 tiles to each player. Unused tiles (in 2- or 3-player games) are returned to the box unseen.  
- Players simultaneously choose one of their 4 tiles and place it face down. All reveal and choose one of three actions:  
  1. **Discard tile** → gain 3 coins (5 if owner of *Sigismund's Column*)  
  2. **Build on empty space** → pay tile cost, place tile touching at least one existing tile orthogonally (side-to-side)  
  3. **Overbuild** → place tile on top of an existing tile, reducing cost by the covered tile’s price. No refund if new tile is cheaper.  

- Tiles may be rotated before placement.  
- A district may not exceed **3×4 or 4×3 tiles** (12 tiles), unless the player owns *Prudential*, allowing up to **4×4 (16 tiles)**.  
- After each round of tile selection, players pass remaining tiles:  
  - **Left** in odd-numbered epochs (I, III, V)  
  - **Right** in even-numbered epochs (II, IV, VI)  
- Repeat until all 4 tiles are used.

#### Rules of Construction  
- New tiles must orthogonally touch at least one existing tile (diagonal doesn’t count).  
- Overbuilding stacks tiles; only the top tile is active. Covered tile’s effects cease.  
- *Prudential* allows 4×4 grid. If *Prudential* is removed or overbuilt, district must shrink back to 3×4/4×3, discarding excess tiles.

#### Types of Areas  
Each tile has 4 quadrants with building types:  
- Residential (red)  
- Commercial (yellow)  
- Industrial (blue)  
- Cultural (purple)  
- Park (green)  
- Transport (metro icon)  
- Public Building (cost in corner)  
- Milestone (Roman numeral in corner)  

**Connected Areas**:  
- Adjacent same-type quadrants (orthogonal) form one continuous area.  
- Public buildings and milestones are **always individual areas**, even if adjacent.  
- Transport tiles: each counts as one area if not connected; connected transport tiles count as one area.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Income Phase (after construction)  
**1. War (Epochs III and IV only)**  
- **Epoch III (WWI)**: Each player discards **1 tile** (and any underneath).  
- **Epoch IV (WWII)**: Each player discards **2 tiles** from different spaces (and any underneath).  
- Cannot discard a tile that would split the district into disconnected parts.

**2. Milestone Award**  
- Award the milestone between current and next epoch to the player who best fulfills its condition.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Fewer coins → fewer VP → if still tied, milestone is discarded.  
- Winner places milestone **for free** in their district (on empty space or overbuild).  

**Milestone Conditions & Effects**:

| Metro | Most transport icons | +1 VP per adjacent transport icon (max 4) |  
| Europa Market | Most commercial areas | +15 coins |  

**3. Scoring & Income**  
Players gain VP and coins in this order:  
- **Park Scoring**: Choose **one** park. Gain VP based on number of **adjacent residential areas**:  
  1: 1 VP, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 5, 5: 7, 6: 10, 7: 13, 8: 16, 9+: +3 per additional  
- **Commercial**: +1 coin per residential area adjacent to each commercial area  
- **Cultural**: +VP as printed on tile(s)  
- **Industrial**: +coins as printed; **lose 1 VP** if any residential area is adjacent to any industrial area  
- **Transport**: +2 VP per transport icon, **only if at least 2 unconnected transport tiles exist**  
- **Public Buildings & Milestones**: Apply their printed effects

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a tile that doesn’t connect?** No. Must orthogonally touch at least one existing tile.  
- **Can I overbuild on a milestone?** Yes. It counts as overbuilding; cost is reduced.  
- **What happens if I lose *Prudential*?** District must shrink to 3×4 or 4×3; discard excess tiles.  
- **Do transport areas need to be unconnected?** Yes. Connected transport tiles count as one area.  
- **Can I score multiple parks with *Royal Baths Park*?** Yes. Choose two separate parks and score both using the park scoring table.  
- **Can I use *Marywil* on a commercial area with no adjacent residential areas?** Yes, but income is 0, so doubling has no effect.  
- **Does *Arsenal* protect itself from war?** No. You cannot choose to lose it, but if it's the only one left, you must discard it.
