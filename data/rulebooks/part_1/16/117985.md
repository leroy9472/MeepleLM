## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Star Trek Catan is a sci-fi adaptation of *Settlers of Catan*, set in the Star Trek universe. Players take on the roles of Federation captains expanding their influence across sectors of space by building starships, outposts, and habitat rings. The objective is to be the first to reach **10 victory points** through constructing settlements (space stations), achieving special objectives (e.g., longest supply route), and acquiring Development Cards.

### 2. Components  
From base game and expansion:

- **Sector Hexes**: 30 hexes including planets (Dilithium, Tritanium, Food, Water, Oxygen), asteroid fields, and space.
- **Number Tokens**: 28 tokens (2–12) placed on hexes to determine resource production.
- **Starships**: Replace roads; used to extend routes.
- **Outposts (Small Space Stations)**: Worth 1 VP; replace settlements.
- **Habitat Rings (Large Space Stations)**: Upgraded outposts; worth 2 VP.
- **Resource Cards**: Dilithium, Tritanium, Food, Water, Oxygen.
- **Development Cards**: Utopia Planitia, Research Station, Monopoly, Starfleet Intervenes.
- **Klingon Ship**: Replaces the robber; blocks resource production on a hex.
- **Character/Support Cards**: Provide special abilities (e.g., Kirk’s protection from 7s).
- **Building Cost Cards**: Reference for construction costs.
- **Friendemy Tokens** (implied): Track alliances or rivalries (not detailed in rules).
- **Harbor Pieces**: Enable special trading (details not fully provided).
- **Dice**: Two six-sided dice for resource generation.

For 5–6 players:
- Additional components from second game copy:
  - 2 each planet hex, 1 asteroid field, 1 of each number token
  - 2 full sets of starships, outposts, habitat rings
  - 5 of each resource card type
  - 9 Development Cards (6 Starfleet Intervenes, 1 Monopoly, 1 Research Station, 1 Utopia Planitia)
  - 2 Building Cost cards

### 3. Setup  
**Base Game (3–4 Players):**
1. Assemble board using 19 sector hexes (randomized placement).
2. Place number tokens in spiral order:  
   `2,5,4,6,3,9,8,11,11,10,6,3,8,4,8,10,11,12,10,5,4,9,5,9,12,3,2,6`  
   Skip asteroid fields when placing tokens.
3. Each player places:
   - 1 outpost (small space station)
   - 1 starship
   - 2nd small space station with associated Support Card drawn from numbered stack (A-side up)
4. Distribute starting resources: One of each resource for each adjacent hex to outpost.
5. Place Klingon ship on any asteroid field.

**5–6 Player Expansion:**
- Use larger board with all 30 hexes.
- Frame assembly includes special trading post and space frame pieces at specified joints:
  - All-space piece at “2-2”
  - 2-1 Food trading post at “3-3”
  - 3-1 Generic trading post at “5-5”
  - All-space piece at “6-6”
- Follow same hex placement and numbering rules.
- Additional players use components from second game copy.

**Character/Support Cards Setup:**
- Numbered Support Cards (1–6) stacked A-side up; used during setup.
- Remaining Support Cards (including non-numbered) placed face-up in Display.
- After setup, players may draw from Display when using a card.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Turn order with **Special Building Phase** (for 5–6 players):

1. **Roll the Dice**  
   - Roll two dice. All players with outposts/habitat rings adjacent to hexes showing the rolled number receive corresponding resource cards.
   - On a roll of **7**, activate Klingon movement.

2. **Trading and Building Phase (Current Player)**  
   - Trade with other players or use harbor trades.
   - Build starships, outposts, habitat rings.
   - Purchase Development Cards (cost: 1 Dilithium, 1 Tritanium, 1 Oxygen).
   - Play **one** Development Card **during your turn only**.

3. **End of Turn**  
   - Pass dice to next player.

4. **Special Building Phase (Other Players Only)**  
   - All other players take turns **clockwise**, starting with player to left of current player.
   - May build or buy Development Cards using **existing resources only**.
   - **No trading**, **no card playing**, **no Border Trade** allowed.
   - Cannot play Development or Support Cards.

Repeat sequence.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Resource Production  
- Based on dice roll.
- Hexes produce resources unless blocked by Klingon.
- Players with adjacent outposts/habitat rings draw 1 resource card per structure.
- On **7**, players with >7 resource cards discard half (rounded down); Klingon moves.

#### Klingon Ship  
- Blocks resource production on its hex.
- Moved via:
  - Rolling a **7**
  - Playing a **Starfleet Intervenes** card
  - Using **Pavel Chekov** ability
- When moved, robber steals 1 random resource from a player with adjacent structure.

#### Development Cards  
Purchased during your turn (1 per turn max). Types:
- **Utopia Planitia**: Build 2 starships for free (normal placement rules apply).
- **Research Station**: Take any 2 resource cards from supply.
- **Monopoly**: Name a resource; all players give you all cards of that type.
- **Starfleet Intervenes**: Move Klingon to any hex and steal 1 card.

Each card grants **1 VP** when played (not held).

#### Support/Character Cards  
Each player has **one** face-up Support Card (A-side). After use:
- Option 1: Return to Display, draw new card (A-side up)
- Option 2: Flip to B-side for future use  
After second use, return to Display and draw new card.

Cards cannot be used on the turn they are acquired.

**Card Abilities:**
- **Christine Chapel**: After dice roll, take 1 resource from player with more VPs than you.
- **Hikaru Sulu**: Move one of your terminal starships to another legal location.
- **James T. Kirk**: On a 7, avoid discarding if over 7 cards; if 7 or fewer, gain 1 free resource.
- **Janice Rand**: Trade any resource at 2:1 ratio freely during your turn.
- **Leonard McCoy**: When buying a Development Card, substitute one required resource; choose from top 3 cards.
- **Montgomery Scott**: When building a starship, substitute required Dilithium or Tritanium with any resource.
- **Pavel Chekov**: On your turn (before rolling), move Klingon to asteroid field; gain resource from former hex.
- **Sarek**: Remove one starship; pay 1 Tritanium + 1 Dilithium to build outpost, or 2 Water + 1 Oxygen to upgrade to habitat ring.
- **Spock**: If no resources on a non-7 roll, gain any 1 resource.
- **Uhura**: Demand up to 2 specific resources from other players; give one resource in return per resource received.

#### Victory Point Sources  
- Small Space Station (Outpost): **1 VP**
- Large Space Station (Habitat Ring): **2 VP**
- Longest Supply Route (5+ connected starships): **2 VP**
- Largest Starfleet (4+ starships): **2 VP**
- Each Development Card played: **1 VP**

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Track victory points throughout.
- Game ends **immediately** at the end of a player’s turn when they reach **10 or more VP**.
- That player wins. If tie, most VP wins; if still tied, most resources breaks tie.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a Development Card during the Special Building Phase?**  
  No. Only during your own turn, when you hold the dice.

- **Can I trade during the Special Building Phase?**  
  No. Only build or buy Development Cards using current hand.

- **Can I use a Support Card the turn I get it?**  
  No. Must wait until a future turn.

- **What happens if the Klingon is on a hex with no adjacent players?**  
  No theft occurs when moved, but production remains blocked.

- **Can I build during the Special Building Phase if I just drew a card?**  
  Yes, if the card was drawn before the phase (e.g., from Research Station), and resources are in hand.

- **Can Sarek’s ability upgrade an outpost without paying standard cost?**  
  Yes. Sarek allows building an outpost by removing a starship and paying 1 Tritanium + 1 Dilithium (instead of normal 1 Dilithium, 1 Tritanium, 1 Food, 1 Water). Upgrading requires 2 Water + 1 Oxygen (vs. standard 2 Food, 3 Oxygen).

- **Does Longest Route require continuous connection to home base?**  
  No, only longest continuous chain of starships (≥5) qualifies.
