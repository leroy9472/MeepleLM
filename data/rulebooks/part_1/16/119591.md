## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Rialto is a strategy board game set in Renaissance Venice, where players take on the roles of powerful families vying for influence through control of districts, infrastructure, and political power. The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VP) over six rounds by strategically placing councilmen, building structures, and leveraging special abilities from buildings.

### 2. Components  
- Game board depicting six districts divided by the Grand Canal  
- 6 Round tiles (one per round)  
- Doge Track (determines turn order and ties)

- Building tiles (by color and value: 1–4)  
- Player boards (with building slots and storage areas)  
- Deck of action cards (including Jokers)  
- Gondola tiles  
- Bridge tiles  
- Bonus tiles (5 VP each, placed on either side of Grand Canal)

### 3. Setup

- Place bonus tiles on both sides of the Grand Canal.  
- Sort building tiles by color and value; place on corresponding spaces on the board.  
- Place gold coins in the general supply.  
- Shuffle the action card deck.  
- Randomly determine the starting player.  
- Each player takes:  
  - A player board  
  - Colored counters (for Doge Track and buildings)  
  - 5 councilmen placed on their player board (personal supply)  
  - Remaining councilmen go to the general supply  
  - Starting gold:  
    - 2 players: 1, 2  
    - 3 players: 1, 2, 3  
    - 4 players: 1, 2, 2, 3  
    - 5 players: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3  
- Stack all Doge Track counters with the starting player on top.  
- All players start at 3 VP on the VP track.  
- Each player selects a value-1 building:  
  - 2p/3p: must choose different buildings  
  - 4p/5p: no more than two players may choose the same building  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
There are 6 rounds. Each round has 3 phases:

#### Phase 1: Card Drafting  
- Move the round marker to the district indicated by the current Round tile.  
- Lay out N+1 rows of 6 face-up cards (N = number of players).  
- Starting with the player to the right of the start player and proceeding counter-clockwise, each player:  
  - Selects one full row of 6 face-up cards  
  - Draws 2 additional cards from the face-down deck  
  - Adds these to any leftover cards from previous rounds (if allowed by abilities)  
- Players may gain extra cards via Green buildings.  
- Each player must reduce their hand to **7 cards** (unless modified by Green buildings). Discard excess.  
- Green buildings may be activated **after** all players have selected their rows.

#### Phase 2: Action Execution (6 Stages: A–F)  
Stages proceed in order: A (Doge), B (Gold), C (Building), D (Bridge), E (Gondola), F (Councilman).  
- In Stage A, the leader on the Doge Track is the starting player.  
- In each subsequent stage, the player who wins the bonus starts.  
- Play proceeds clockwise. Each player may:  
  - Play any number of cards of the current stage’s type  
  - Pass (play zero cards)  
- Actions are resolved based on number of cards played.  
- The player who plays the **most cards** in a stage receives the stage bonus.  
  - No bonus if all players pass.  
- Used cards are discarded face-down.  
- Hand sizes must remain visible.  
- Yellow buildings may be activated during this phase.  

##### Stage A – DOGE  
- For each Doge card played, advance 1 space on the Doge Track.  
- Entering an occupied space: place your counter on top.  
- **Bonus**: +1 additional space.  

##### Stage B – GOLD  
- For each Gold card played, gain 1 gold coin.  
- **Bonus**: +1 additional gold.  

##### Stage C – BUILDING  
- Choose a building with value ≤ number of cards played.  
- Place it on an empty slot on your player board.  
- Duplicates allowed.  
- **Bonus**: Add +1 to the number of cards played (i.e., can take a building of value up to cards+1).  

##### Stage D – BRIDGE  
- For each Bridge card played, gain 1 VP.  
- Players who play **no cards** lose 1 VP.  
- **Bonus**: Gain +1 VP and place the top Bridge tile on any free connection between two districts (orientation chosen by player).  

##### Stage E – GONDOLA  
- For each Gondola card played, move 1 councilman from general supply to personal supply.  
- If no councilmen left in general supply: gain 1 VP per card played (i.e., per missing councilman).  
- **Bonus**: Place a Gondola tile on any free connection. Then:  
  - Move 1 councilman from general supply to **either** district connected by the new Gondola.  
  - If general supply empty: gain 1 VP and may use a councilman from personal supply or already on the board.  
- **District Bonus**: First player with at least 1 councilman in each of the three districts on **one side** of the Grand Canal immediately gains 5 VP and flips the corresponding bonus tile.  

##### Stage F – COUNCILMAN  
- For each Councilman card played, move 1 councilman from personal supply to the **current round’s district**.  
- If no councilmen in personal supply, move any of your councilmen already on the board.  
- **Bonus**: +1 additional councilman placed in the current district.  
- **District Bonus**: Same as E — if multiple players achieve the 3-district control during this stage, **each** gets 5 VP.  

##### Joker Rules (Phase 2)  
- Jokers can be added to any card play as wildcards.  
- Cannot play a Joker alone.  
- If you have **no cards** of the required type, you may play **2 Jokers** to count as **1 card** of that type.  
- Additional Jokers may be added normally (1 Joker = 1 card).  

#### Phase 3: Building Activation  
- Players may activate **Blue buildings** by placing a coin on them.  
- Each building can be activated only once per round.  
- Activation is simultaneous; order does not matter.  
- Coins are returned to general supply at end of round.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Doge Track**:  
  - Determines turn order in Phase 1 and ties in all scoring.  
  - If multiple counters on same space, order is **top to bottom**.  
- **Building Activation**:  
  - Green: Phase 1 (after drafting)  
  - Yellow: Phase 2 (during action stages)  
  - Blue: Phase 3 (end of round)  
  - Each building can only be activated once per round. Coins removed at round end.  
- **Councilman Movement**:  
  - General supply → personal supply (E)  
  - Personal supply → current district (F)  
  - Reuse councilmen from board if personal supply empty (F)  
- **Hand Management**:  
  - Default hand size: 7  
  - Can be increased by Green buildings  
- **Building Acquisition**:  
  - Value must be ≤ number of cards played (or +1 with bonus)  
  - Max 7 buildings per player. If full, return one to gain VP equal to its value.  
  - If taking building >4 value: take a 4-value first, then another ≤ remainder.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after Round 6. Final scoring:

1. **Leftover Resources**:  
   - Score VP = ⌈(total leftover councilmen + coins) / 2⌉ (round up)  

2. **Buildings**:  
   - Score VP equal to sum of values of all owned buildings  

3. **District Scoring (per district)**:  
   - Only players with **at least 1 councilman** in the district score.  
   - Score based on total value of **adjacent Bridge and Gondola tiles**.  
   - Rank players by this value:  
     - 1st: full value in VP  
     - 2nd: half of 1st (round down)  
     - 3rd: half of 2nd (round down)  
     - etc.  
   - Tiebreaker: Doge Track order (top counter wins)  

4. **Final Victory**:  
   - Highest total VP wins.  
   - Tiebreaker: Doge Track (top counter wins)  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Hand Size**: Must be reduced to 7 (or modified max) before Phase 2. Discards are final.  
- **Building Capacity**: Only 7 buildings allowed. Must return one before taking a new one if full.  
- **Joker Usage**:  
  - 2 Jokers = 1 card when no cards of type in hand  
  - 1 Joker = 1 card when supplementing actual cards  
- **Bonus Tile Timing**:  
  - E Stage: first to complete 3-district side gets 5 VP immediately  
  - F Stage: all who complete it during F get 5 VP (no "first" requirement)  
- **Bridge/Gondola Placement**:  
  - Must be on free connection (no double links)  
  - Player chooses orientation (which way the tile faces)  
- **Empty General Supply**:  
  - In E: gain 1 VP per card played  
  - In E Bonus: gain 1 VP and may use personal or board councilman  
- **Councilman Movement in F**:  
  - Must use personal supply first  
  - If empty, may move any of your councilmen on the board  
  - Bonus: +1 councilman into current district (same rules apply)
