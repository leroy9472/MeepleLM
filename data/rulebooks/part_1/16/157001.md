## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Trains: Rising Sun is a deck-building game set in Japan where players act as railway developers expanding rail networks across regional maps. The goal is to strategically build rail lines, expand stations, and acquire valuable cards to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the game.

The game ends when any one of these conditions is met:
- Any 4 card stacks in the Supply (excluding Waste) are depleted.
- A player has placed all their Rail Tokens.
- All Station Tokens have been placed on the board.

Final scoring determines the winner based on VPs from city connections, remote locations, and gold-colored cards. In case of a tie, the player with more Rail Tokens on the board wins; if still tied, players share victory.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Choose Board & Player Count**  
   - 3–4 players: Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya  
   - 2 players: Chiba, Kyushu, Saitama, Texas, Italy, California  
   - Promo/expansion maps follow specific rules (see Appendix)

2. **Prepare Tokens**  
   - Each player takes all Rail Tokens of one color:
     - 19 per player (Nagoya, Tokyo, Osaka)
     - 16 per player (Chiba, Kyushu, Saitama, Texas, Italy, California)
   - Place one Rail Token on the 0 space of the VP track as a scoring marker.
   - Set aside correct number of white Station Tokens:
     - Nagoya: 30
     - Chiba: 16
     - Kyushu: 19
     - Saitama: 16
     - Texas: 19
     - Italy/California: 15
     - Others: as printed

3. **Starting Decks**  
   Each player receives:
   - 7 × Normal Train (return extras to box)
   - 2 × Lay Rails
   - 1 × Station Expansion  
   Shuffle into a personal draw deck.

4. **Card Supply**  
   Create supply piles:
   - 20 × Express Train
   - 10 × Limited Express Train
   - 20 × Lay Rails (minus starting decks)
   - 20 × Station Expansion (minus starting decks)
   - 10 × Office Building
   - 10 × Distribution Centre
   - 10 × Stadium
   - 70 × Waste

   **For 2-player games**: Limit each non-Waste pile to 7 cards. Return excess to box.

5. **Randomizer Cards**  
   - Shuffle Randomizer deck.
   - Draw 8 cards; add corresponding card stacks to supply.
   - Return unused Randomizer cards to box.

6. **Route Bonus Cards (Optional)**  
   - Use only for selected board.
   - Shuffle 5 relevant cards.
   - Reveal number equal to players; place face-up near board.
   - For each revealed card:
     - Place matching Route Markers (A/B/C) on both cities listed.

7. **Starting Hands & First Placement**  
   - Each player draws 5 cards.
   - Starting player chosen (e.g., last person to ride a train).
   - Clockwise, each player places one Rail Token on any land hex except:
     - Sea hexes
     - Remote Locations (starred hexes)
   - Typically placed on city hexes.

   *Chiba 2P variant*: Players may agree to start on red "S" cities (Tateyama, Kamogawa, Katsuura).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, they choose either a **Normal Turn** or **Pass**, then perform **Clean-Up**.

#### Normal Turn (choose this or Pass)
You may perform the following actions in any order, any number of times:
- Play cards
- Buy cards

Actions must be completed fully before starting another.

##### Play Cards
- Take a card from hand, place face-up in play area.
- Gain money = value in top-left corner (regardless of effect use).
- Decide whether to apply card effects:
  - Must apply all effects **in full** and **in order** (top to bottom).
  - If any effect cannot be resolved, **none** may be applied.
  - Exception: If asked to gain Waste but none is available, you may still apply other effects.

Unspent money is lost at end of turn.

##### Buy Cards
- Pay cost (top-right number) using money gained this turn.
- May buy multiple cards, including duplicates.
- Cards go to “gained cards” area (not deck or discard yet).
- Cannot buy if pile is empty.

##### Pass
- Return all Waste cards from hand to Waste supply.
- Do **not** play or buy cards.
- Proceed to Clean-Up.

#### Clean-Up Phase (required every turn)
1. Move all cards (hand, play area, gained cards) to discard pile.
2. Draw 5 new cards.
3. If draw deck is empty:
   - Shuffle discard pile to form new deck.
   - Continue drawing.
4. Check end-game conditions.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Lay Rails (Card Effect)
- Place one Rail Token on a hex adjacent to your existing token.
- Cannot place in sea.
- Only one of your tokens per hex (others may co-occupy).
- Pay placement cost:
  - Field: 0
  - River: 1
  - Mountain: 2
  - City: 1 + number of Station Tokens already present
  - Remote Location: number shown in star
  - Space with other players’ tokens: pay 1 per opposing token + gain 1 Waste

- Costs are cumulative (e.g., city with station and opponent token = 1+station count + opponent tokens).

#### Station Expansion (Card Effect)
- Place one Station Token on **any city hex**.
- Max stations per city = number printed on city space.
- No adjacency requirement.

#### Complete Route (Bonus)
- First player to connect two cities marked on a Route Bonus card via contiguous path of their own Rail Tokens claims the card.
- Score VPs immediately.
- Keep card in front of you; use its special ability **once**, **at any time during your turn**.
- After use, remove card from game.
- Remove Route Markers from board and card.

#### Card Types & Effects
- **Draw**: Draw X cards immediately.
- **Trash**: Remove a card from game (put in box).
- **Attack**: Affects other players; resolve clockwise starting with active player.
  - "Each player" includes self.
  - "Each other player" excludes self.
- **Reaction**: Can be played during another player’s turn when triggered.
- **Reveal**: Show card from deck/hand; return to hand after resolution.

#### Money & Spending
- Gained only by playing cards (top-left value).
- Spent only during same turn.
- Can be used to buy cards or pay rail placement costs.
- Lay Rails points (from cards like Interchange) function like money and can be used flexibly.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Triggers (check after Clean-Up)
Game ends at the end of any player’s turn if:
- 4 non-Waste supply stacks are empty.
- Any player has placed all Rail Tokens.
- All Station Tokens are on the board.

#### Final Scoring  
Each player scores:
1. **City Tokens**: For each Rail Token in a city:
   - 0 stations: 0 VP
   - 1 station: 2 VP
   - 2 stations: 4 VP
   - 3 stations: 8 VP
2. **Remote Locations**: For each Rail Token in a Remote Location (starred hex), score VP = number on hex.
3. **Gold-Colored Cards**: Score face VP value for every gold card in:
   - Hand
   - Discard pile
   - Draw deck

Total all three categories.

#### Winning
- Highest VP wins.
- Tie: Most Rail Tokens on board wins.
- Still tied: Players share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Money & Lay Rails Points**: Both are spent the same way; Interchange allows spending points from newly drawn cards in same turn.
- **Multiple Distant Partners**: You may:
  - Use two discounts on one remote rail.
  - Use each on separate remote rails.
- **Politician vs Legal Counsel**: Legal Counsel is immune. In 2P, attacker passes card to themselves.
- **Waste Gain When Unavailable**: If no Waste in supply, you may still apply remaining card effects.
- **Shuffling Discard Pile**: Only reshuffle when needing to draw and deck is empty.
- **Route Completion Timing**: Must be first to fully connect two marked cities with own rails. Markers removed after first completion.
- **Card Errata**: Always gain card’s top-left money when played, even if not using effects.
