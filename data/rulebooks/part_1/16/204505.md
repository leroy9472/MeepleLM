# MUSEUM: Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
MUSEUM is set in the early 20th century, the golden age of museum collecting, when curators competed to display the most impressive collections of global artefacts. As a museum curator, your goal is to amass valuable Objects from four Continents—Africa & the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and America & the Pacific—and exhibit them to score victory points. Points are earned by displaying Objects, forming Collections (Civilisation, Domain, or Patron-based), and achieving special end-game bonuses. The player with the highest score after someone reaches 50 points wins.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn has two phases:

### 1. Exploration Phase (Active Player)
- Active player **must** draw 1 Object card from any Continent and add it to their hand.
- Each opponent, starting left, **may** draw 1 card from any Continent for free.
- For each opponent who draws, active player gains 1 Prestige point.

### 2. Action Phase (Active Player)
Choose one action:
- **Furbish Museum**: Exhibit Objects, hire Experts, play Favour cards, or place Objects in Pavilions/Loans.
- **Perform Inventory**: Take cards from discard pile into hand (up to 7 total).

After Action Phase:
- **Refill Board**: Draw cards to restore 2 per Continent (if below).
- **Public Opinion**: If a Public Opinion card is revealed during refill, add a token to that Continent and discard the card.
- **End of Round**: When first player’s turn comes again:
  - Draw a new Headline card (replace old one).
  - Refill Expert Board (slide right, draw new).
  - In Black Market: Refresh Market (discard end card, slide, draw new).

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Exhibiting Objects
To place a card in your Museum:
- Pay its value by discarding cards from hand to your Common Pool (discard), using Prestige points (1 token = 1 value), or Favour cards.
- You may overpay; no change.
- Cards can be played from:
  - **Hand**: Discard cards from hand.
  - **Your Discard**: Pay using other cards or Prestige.
  - **Another Player’s Discard**: Pay 1 Prestige to owner, then pay card’s value into their discard.

### Collections
#### Civilisation (Colour)
- At least 3 cards of the same colour (e.g., Roman).
- Only one per Civilisation.
- Scored at end based on size (see Gaming Aid).

#### Domain (Icon)
- At least 3 cards with same icon (e.g., Theology) but **different** Civilisations.
- Only one per Domain.
- Scored at end based on size.

#### Patron Collections
- Defined by Patron card chosen at start.
- May require Civilisation, Domain, or Continent counts.
- Scored at end based on card.

### Adjacency
- Cards in a Collection must be orthogonally adjacent (up/down/left/right).
- Collections can branch, turn corners, and overlap if cards qualify for both.

### Favour Cards
- Draw 1 when passing 10, 20, 30... on score track.
- May play **one per turn** during your Action Phase.
- Max 3 in hand (5 with Richard Bellota).
- Discard after use.

### Experts
- Hire during Action Phase by paying card cost.
- Slide others right, draw new.
- Effects stack; stay until end.
- Some reduce costs, grant Prestige, or boost Collections.

### Headline Cards
- Draw at start of first player’s second turn and each subsequent first-player turn.
- Affects all players.
- Examples: Close Continent, change card count, alter cost.

### Public Opinion
- When a Public Opinion card is drawn during refill, place token on that Continent.
- At end of game, lose 1 VP per token per matching card in your discard.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
