## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Gloom of Kilforth is a high fantasy game where 1–4 players take on the roles of heroes journeying through the perilous land of Kilforth to defeat an Ancient — a primordial evil — before time runs out. Over 25 days, heroes face dangerous encounters, complete epic sagas, and gather power to confront the Ancient. The gloom spreads each night, threatening heroes with HP loss.

**Winning Conditions:**
- **Competitive/Solo:** The hero who defeats the final Ancient wins. If time runs out, the hero with the most Victory Points (gold + gold value of assets) wins.
- **Cooperative:** All heroes win if all Ancients are defeated before day 25 ends, even if the last surviving hero is defeated in the final battle.
