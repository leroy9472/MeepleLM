## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
New Angeles is under threat from a covert group seeking to ensure Federalist control. The player assumes the role of three cooperating corporations working together to prevent this outcome and maintain stability. The objective is to avoid triggering a Federalist victory while maximizing corporate capital. The player wins if, at game end, the lowest capital among the three corporations is at least 25. The player loses if threat reaches 25 or if the lowest corporate capital is below 25.

### 2. Components

  - (Optional: reduce to 7/8/9 for higher difficulty)  
- Draw Action cards per each corporation’s sheet.  
- Draw 2 Investment cards; keep 1, return 1 to top of deck (shared across all three corporations).  
- Return all Rival cards to the box. Do not perform step 10 (rival assignment).  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds until either threat reaches 25 or the third Demand round ends. Each round consists of:  
1. **Action Phase** (repeated until no Asset cards remain on turn track)  
2. **Production Phase**  
3. **Event Phase**  
After Event Phase:  
- If round track lands on a numbered space: next Standard Round  
- If on a Demand space: resolve a Demand Round  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action Phase  
Each turn within the Action Phase:  
1. **Refresh**  
   - Ready all exhausted Asset cards for all three corporations.  
   - Each corporation draws Action cards as specified on its sheet (General = any undrawn type).  
2. **Resolve Deal**  
   - **Asset**: Active Corporation reveals the rightmost Asset card and places it in the Revealed Asset box.  
   - **Main Offer**: Active Corporation plays 1 Action card or Emergency Action face-up in Main Offer box.  
   - **Counter-offer**:  
     - Player rolls d100 and consults Counter-offer table (implied but not provided; assume standard thresholds apply).  
     - The roll determines the number of supporting cards needed to win the deal.  
   - **Support**:  
     - In clockwise order, the player plays support cards (from hand) for the other two corporations.  
     - Cards are played face-down in support of either Main Offer or Counter-offer.  
   - **Resolution**:  
     - If Main Offer has at least as many supporting cards as specified by Counter-offer roll, Active Corporation wins:  
       - Resolves the Action card effect  
       - Claims the Asset card  
     - If support is insufficient:  
       - Asset card is discarded  
       - Apply effect listed on Counter-offer table (e.g., threat increase, loss of capital)  
3. **End of Turn**  
   - Resolve any "End of Turn" Asset abilities (in player’s chosen order).  
   - Each corporation discards down to 5 Action cards if necessary.  
   - Pass Active Corporation status to the next corporation in clockwise order.  

#### Production Phase  
- The three districts with Android tokens are exploited:  
  - Move resource tokens up by the district’s production values.  
  - Increase unrest in each exploited district:  
    - Stable → Protest  
    - Protest → Strike  
    - Strike → no change  
- Apply modifiers:  
  - Human First in district: unrest increases by 2 stages (max to Strike, then Outage if applicable).  
  - Outage or Strike: no production.  
  - Orgcrime: primary resource not produced.  
  - Development: +1 to primary resource.  

#### Event Phase  
- Resolve top Event card from top to bottom.  
- Place components (enemy units, tokens) in listed districts.  
- Enforce limits: no duplicate enemy units, Outage, or Illness tokens per district.  
  - If conflict, move component along movement path until placed or enters The Root.  
  - If enters The Root: return to reserve, +2 threat.  
- Reset turn track: draw number of Asset cards equal to number in lower-right corner of Event card; place facedown on turn track starting from lowest slot.  
- Advance round track token:  
  - Numbered space → next Standard Round  
  - Demand space → Demand Round  

#### Demand Round  
1. **Score Investment**  
   - Reveal Investment card.  
   - Player chooses which one of the three corporations gains the capital.  
   - Capital cannot be split.  
2. **Pay Demand & Reveal Demand**  
   - Check if all resources meet or exceed targets on Demand card.  
   - If not met: increase threat by amount on Demand card.  
   - Game ends immediately after this step in the third Demand Round.  
3. **Choose Investment**  
   - Return all Investment cards to deck, shuffle.  
   - Draw 2, keep 1, return 1 to top of deck.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Conditions**:  
  - Threat reaches 25 → player loses.  
  - End of third Demand Round → evaluate score.  
- **Final Score**:  
  - Player’s score is the **lowest capital** among the three corporations.  
- **Win Condition**:  
  - Player wins if final score ≥ 25.  
  - Player loses if final score < 25 or threat ≥ 25.  
- **Difficulty Adjustment**:  
  - Reduce starting capital (e.g., 7, 8, 9) to increase challenge.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Trading between Corporations**: Not allowed unless specified by a card effect.  
- **Asset Card Modifications**:  
  - Coach Walden: “When the Corporation to your right wins a deal, gain 1 capital.”  
  - Saul Eustecio: “When the Main Offer fails, you may exhaust this card to reroll the Counter-offer.”  
  - Isabel McGuire: Usable in support of Main Offer.  
- **Inactive Asset Cards (no effect in solo)**:  
  - Aaron Marron, Bryan Stinson, Caprice Nisei, Chief Gorman, Eiko, Elizabeth Mills, Jackson Howard, Lily Lockwell, Locust Company, Mark Yale, Monica Singh, Susan Chen, The Fall Guy, Thomas Haas  
  - These can be discarded for:  
    - Gain 1 capital, OR  
    - Reroll any Counter-offer die (even if not Active Corporation); new roll must be accepted.  
- **Emergency Actions**:  
  - Can be used in deals.  
  - If winning offer: returned facedown.  
  - If losing: returned faceup.  
- **Hand Limit**: 5 Action cards. Discard down at End of Turn.  
- **Capital Tracking**: Each corporation tracks capital independently.
