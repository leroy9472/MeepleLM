## Rise of Tribes – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players lead prehistoric tribes in a struggle for survival and dominance. Through strategic use of actions, resources, and events, players expand their influence across a shared map of terrain hexes. The goal is to be the first to reach **15 victory points (VP)**, achieved by building villages, completing goal cards (Developments and Achievements), and capitalizing on event-driven opportunities.

   - 3 Players: 4 of each  
   - 4 Players: 5 of each  
   - Randomly arrange tiles in the prescribed layout. Set Volcano tile aside.  
2. **Action Board Setup**:  
   - Place 3 dice atop each action column (GROW, MOVE, GATHER, LEAD), showing Sun, Moon, Blank in that order.  
   - Place 2 dice aside for first roll.  
3. **Event Deck**:

     - 1 shuffled Goal Card deck (15 cards)  
   - In 2-player game, remove Pottery Development cards from decks.  
5. **Determine Starting Player**:

6. **Initial Placement**:  
   - **1st Player**: Place 2 tribe members in any unoccupied hex.  
   - **2nd Player**: Place 3 tribe members in any unoccupied hex.  
   - **3rd Player**: Place 3 tribe members in one unoccupied hex + collect 2 resources of choice.

7. **Score Track**:  
   - All score markers start at 0 on Action Board.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn consists of **5 Steps**:

#### Step 1: Score Villages  
- Gain **1 VP per village** currently occupied by your tribe members.

#### Step 2: Roll Dice  
- Roll **2 dice**.  
- If **doubles** (2 Suns, 2 Moons, 2 Blanks), trigger an event:  
  1. Resolve any ongoing event effects tied to doubles.  
  2. If an event slot is open, draw the top Event Tile and resolve it.  
  3. Move resolved event tiles to discard.  
  4. Continue with the turn.

#### Step 3: Take Actions  
- Take **2 different actions** (GROW, MOVE, GATHER, LEAD).  
- For each action:  
  - Place one die from your roll at the top of an action column.  
  - Push existing dice rightward; the rightmost die drops down to become part of the next player’s roll pool.  
  - Resolve the action based on the **three dice now visible** in that column.

##### Action Effects (Based on Dice)  
- **2 Suns**: Maximum effect  
- **2 Moons**: Minimum effect  
- **Otherwise**: Standard effect  

| Action  | Standard | 2 Suns | 2 Moons |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **GROW** | Add tribe members (number shown) to hexes you occupy | Max growth | Min growth |
| **MOVE** | Move up to (number) tribe members 1 hex each | Max movement | Min movement |
| **GATHER** | Collect (number) resources from (number) hexes you occupy | Max resources from max hexes | Min resources from min hexes |
| **LEAD** | Draw (number) goal cards | Max draw | Min draw |

- **MOVE Limitation**: Each tribe member may move only once per turn.  
- **LEAD Bonus**: For each **village** you control, you may discard one "in progress" goal card before drawing. Return discarded cards to bottom of deck, then draw replacements + LEAD amount.

#### Step 4: Resolve Conflicts  
- **Population Limit**: 5 tribe members per hex (villages do not count).  
- **Conflict triggers** if >5 tribe members (any mix) are in a hex.  
- Resolve **after both actions**, in current player’s chosen order.

##### Conflict Resolution  
- **Multiple Tribes**:  
  - Current player = **Offense**, others = **Defense**.  
  - All players simultaneously remove **1 tribe member** from the hex.  
  - Repeat until ≤1 tribe remains.  
- **Single Tribe**:  
  - Player removes members until ≤5 remain.  

##### Development Effects (Trigger Simultaneously)  
- **Bow (Development)**: Offense removes 1 defending member before conflict.  
- **Walls (Event)**: Defender removes 1 attacking member if they have a village in the hex.  
- **Hidden Village** does **not** benefit from Walls.  
- **Evasion (Development)**: Defender may save one member from removal.

##### After Conflict:  
- If a village has **no tribe members**, it is **destroyed**.

#### Step 5: Build Villages and Complete Goals  
- **Build Villages**:  
  - Spend resources (as shown on player board) to place a village on a hex you **control** (only your members present) and has no village.  
  - **First Village Built**:  
    - Use the village token from the **Abandoned Village** tile.  
    - Shuffle **Abandoned Village** and **Chieftain** into the event deck.  
- **Complete Goals**:  
  - **Developments**: Pay resources to gain permanent ability + 1 VP.  
  - **Achievements**: Meet conditions (e.g., control hexes) to gain 2–4 VP.  
  - Move completed cards to right side of player board.  
  - Cards may be completed **in the same turn** they are drawn.  
- Player may complete **any number** of goals.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Hex Control Definitions  
- **Occupation**: At least one of your tribe members in the hex.  
- **Majority**: Your members > combined opponents’ in the hex.  
- **Control**: Only your members in the hex.  

#### Events (Detailed)  
Events are triggered by rolling doubles. Some persist; others resolve immediately.

| Event | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Abandoned Village** | In turn order, each player may build 1 village (cost: 1 Food, 1 Stone, 1 Wood). Crafty Builders reduces cost to 2 resources. Hidden Village allows placing village on board. |
| **Altar** | Buy for 3 Food (reduces by 1 Food per double roll, max 3 reductions). Once owned, during Step 5, spend 1 tribe member + 4 same-type resources OR 1 of each resource to gain 1 VP. Tribe member must be on map. |
| **Chieftain** | Bidding: Players bid resources (any type, equal value). Highest bidder wins. Gets 2 VP if bid ≥5, else 1 VP. Winning bid distributed to opponents as winner chooses. Losers keep bids. If no bids, shuffle back into deck. |
| **Discovery** | Place 2 of each resource (Food, Wood, Stone) on tile. When a player’s tribe member **ends a MOVE action** in a hex with **only opponents**, they take 1 resource of choice from tile. No benefit from non-MOVE movement (e.g., Intimidate). Wayfarers counts. |
| **Drought** | Population limit reduced to **4**. Conflicts trigger at 5+. Apply during Step 4. When doubles rolled again, discard event; limit returns to 5. Bow cannot be used if no offensive player. |
| **Dugout Canoe** | Buy for 3 Wood (reduces by 1 per double, max 3 reductions). Allows movement through **Lake hexes at 0 cost**. Combines with Horse or Pathfinder. Not affected by Wayfarers. |
| **Invaders** | Place 3 Invaders on least populated hex (ties broken by current player). Prevent gathering and village building. Add 1 Invader per double (max 5). Remove via conflict. When **current player** removes last Invader, they gain 2 VP. |
| **Mammoth** | Place on least populated **Lake** hex. Player with ≥4 members in same hex may spend 1 action die to:  
  - **Hunt**: Remove Mammoth, gain 3 Food + 1 VP  
  - **Tame**: Pay 3 Food, gain 3 VP  
  - Tamed Mammoth moves freely with tamer’s tribe. If abandoned, Mammoth is removed and tamer loses 3 VP. |
| **Mild Winter** | Place **1 Food per player** on tile. Each time a player takes **GROW**, they add 2 extra tribe members and return 1 Food to supply. When tile is empty, discard event. |
| **Plentiful Food/Stone/Wood** | Place 6 of resource on tile. When taking **GATHER**, gain **2 extra resources per hex** of matching type gathered from. Discard when empty. |
| **Sabertooth Tiger** | Place on **Mountain** hex. Each tribe in hex removes 1 member. On doubles, move to new Mountain hex and repeat. On turn, player may spend 1 action die + remove 1 of their members to **Hunt**, gaining 1 VP. Remove token and discard event. |
| **Shared Knowledge** | After Step 4, if you share a hex with another player, pay 1 resource to draw 1 goal card. Only once per turn. After 3 resources paid, return all to supply and discard event. |
| **Volcano** | Place Volcano tile on edge of map, adjacent to ≥2 hexes, ≥1 with your members (if possible). Then erupt:  
  - **2 Suns**: No deaths, each adjacent tribe gains 1 Stone  
  - **2 Blanks**: Each adjacent tribe loses 1 member, gains 1 Stone  
  - **2 Moons**: Each adjacent tribe loses 2 members, gains 1 Stone  
  - Choose which hex to remove members from if in multiple.  
  - After eruption, shuffle event tile back into deck. Location remains. |
| **Walls** | Buy for 3 Stone (reduces by 1 per double, max 3 reductions). When defending in a hex with your village, remove 1 attacking member before conflict. Works for all your villages. |

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory**: First player to **15 VP** wins **immediately** (no further turns).  
- **Sources of VP**:  
  - 1 VP per village at **start of turn** (Step 1)  
  - 1 VP per **Development** completed  
  - 2–4 VP per **Achievement** completed  
  - Event rewards (e.g., Invaders, Sabertooth)  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can I move through Lake without Dugout Canoe?** Yes, but it costs 1 movement point per Lake hex entered.  
- **What happens if I lose all tribe members?** On your next turn, place 2 members on any unoccupied hex.  
- **Can Hidden Village benefit from Walls?** No.  
- **Can Mammoth be in a hex with Invaders?** Yes – no interaction.  
- **Do Elders count toward Mammoth taming?** No – only regular tribe members.  
- **Can I use Tribe Elder ability on same turn I build village?** Yes – once placed, it’s active.
