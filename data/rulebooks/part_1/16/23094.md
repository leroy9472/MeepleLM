### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each year consists of four phases:

#### PHASE A: EXPANSION
1. **Set Bonus Resources:** Place one each of water, ore, quartz, energy on bonus spaces at Terminal. Reduce supply indicators by 1. Skip if supply = 0.
2. **Specialist Card Auction:**
   - Opening bid ≥1 credit. Player with 0 credits gets 2 from IPF.
   - Bidding proceeds clockwise; highest bidder wins card + bonus resource.
   - Winner chooses from available specialists, receives bonus resource (load if possible).
   - Bidding restarts with next eligible player until all have cards.
3. **Immediate Specialist Actions:**
   - **Fireman:** Takes energy coupler.
   - **Engineer:** Takes building license OR 15 credits.
   - **IPF Agent:** Takes any resource OR upgrades one carrier by 1 class.
4. **Shaft Auction (Venturer):**
   - Venturer chooses empty shaft to auction.
   - If none, auction a neutral platform instead.
   - Winner pays full bid; Venturer pays half (rounded up) if self-winning.
5. **Claim a Shaft:**
   - In specialist order, each player chooses:
     - **Roll Die:** Target empty shaft. 4–6: claim it. 1–3: claim next empty orthogonal shaft. If none, receive 15 credits.
     - **Use Building License:** Claim any empty shaft or replace neutral platform with own. License removed from game.
6. **Place Energy Coupler (Fireman):**
   - Fireman places coupler on one of 7 bottom-row spots. Grants bonus production to all tanks in that column.

#### PHASE B: BUYING
*All actions require activation unless emergency applies.*

1. **Pay Activation Cost:**
   - Pay 1 water to IPF.
   - **Emergency Assistance:** If no water and no water tank, must downgrade one tank to water tank and receive 1 water. Turn ends.
2. **Player Actions (in order, any number/sequence):**
   - **Buy Tank(s):** Cost = current price (from tank supply track) + 1 water per tank. Move supply marker down after each purchase.
   - **Buy Tank(s) from Earth:** Cost = 5 credits + 1 water + 2 quartz. No track adjustment.
   - **Upgrade Tank(s):**
     - Energy: 2 credits
     - Ore: 5 credits
     - Quartz: 8 credits
     - Water: 0 credits
   - **Reequip/Rearrange:** Replace upgrades (full cost), move upgrades, move tanks (1 per platform).
   - **Buy Compressor Dome:** Cost = 1 water + 1 ore + 2 quartz. Increases tank production by 1.
   - **Upgrade Carrier:** Cost = 1 ore + 1 energy per class. Max class 4. Class 2 = flip card; 3/4 = use cards.

#### PHASE C: PRODUCTION
1. **Base Production:**
   - Each tank produces 1 resource (type based on upgrade).
   - Requires 1 energy per tank, **except:**
     - Energy-producing tanks.
     - Water tanks on head shafts (H).
   - Pay energy to IPF before production.
2. **Bonus Production (no extra energy):**
   - **Compressor Dome:** +1 resource per equipped tank (if powered).
   - **Synergy Effect:** Adjacent (orthogonal) same-type tanks owned by same player produce (# tanks – 1) bonus resources (if all powered).
   - **Energy Coupler:** +1 resource per tank in same column (if powered).
3. **Resource Trading:**
   - Trade in order: quartz, ore, water, energy (unless expert variant with trading markers).
   - For each resource, players act in specialist order: buy, sell, or pass.
     - **Buy:** Pay price × quantity. Reduce supply. Excess beyond carrier capacity returned to supply.
     - **Sell:** Receive price × quantity. Increase supply.
     - **Pass:** No transaction.
   - After each player's action (including pass), adjust price based on current supply (see supply table).
4. **Certificate Trading:**
   - In specialist order, choose one:
     - **Buy Building License:** 1 quartz + 2 water.
     - **Sell Building License:** Receive 15 credits (removed from game).
     - **Buy Deed of Ownership:** 1 quartz + 1 ore (worth 50 credits at game end).

#### PHASE D: YEAR-END
1. **Produce New Tanks:**
   - For each 1 ore + 1 energy in supply, produce 1 tank (max 14 in hall).
   - Reduce ore and energy supply accordingly.
   - If unable to produce due to missing ore or energy:
     - Price of missing resource(s) increases by +4 steps.
2. **Advance Year Marker.**
3. **Return Specialist Cards and Energy Coupler** to starting areas.
4. **Replenish Bonus Resources** for next year (start player).
5. Begin next year.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Player Order:** Determined annually by specialist card auction.
- **Energy Management:** Critical for production; must be paid before production.
- **Supply & Price Tracks:**
  - Supply affects price during trading.
  - Price adjusted after each player’s action per resource.
- **Building License:** One-time use for guaranteed shaft claim or neutral takeover.
- **Synergy:** Requires adjacency and same tank type; only active if all involved tanks are powered.
- **Carrier Limits:** Excess resources are lost if carrier capacity exceeded.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Game End:** When year marker leaves the board (after final year completed, including Year-End Phase).

**Final Scoring (sum all):**
- **Resources in Carriers:** Value = current Terminal price.
- **Platform with Tank:** 50 credits each.
- **Platform without Tank:** 25 credits each.
- **Compressor Dome:** 50 credits each.
- **Deed of Ownership:** 50 credits each.
- **Cash on Hand:** Full value.
- **Unused Items:** Building licenses, carriers, upgrades = 0 value.

**Winner:** Player with most total credits. Tie = multiple winners.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **No Bonus Resources Available:** If supply = 0 at auction start, no bonus is placed. Unclaimed bonuses at auction end return to supply.
- **Emergency Assistance:** Only triggers if no water AND no water tank. Downgrading is mandatory; turn ends.
- **Carrier Overflow:** During production or purchase, excess resources beyond capacity are returned to IPF.
- **Price Caps:** Prices cannot exceed max or fall below min on track.
- **Tank Market Depletion:** If last tank bought, remove supply marker. No more tanks until Year-End.
- **No Shaft Available:** Die roll option invalid; must use license or get 15 credits.
- **Synergy Spanning Head Shafts:** Only possible for water/energy; ore/quartz tanks cannot be placed on head shafts in expert variant (but base game allows it).
