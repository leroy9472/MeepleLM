### 1. Lore & Objective
Fifteen years ago, the secret society "CLOUD" triggered an environmental catastrophe by destroying oil sites and forests. Now, players pilot airships across the ruined landscape, gathering resources, battling CLOUD militia, and developing their technology. The goal is to earn the most victory points by the end of the game through resource production, project completion, upgrades, and mission fulfillment.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game lasts 6–8 rounds depending on player count and scenario. Each round has three phases:

#### 1. Production Phase
- Pass start player marker clockwise (skip first round).
- Check round track: if a book is active (marker to its left removed last round), all players may perform the book action from story/scenario card.
- **Produce:** Pay energy to produce water and possibly victory points based on current production level. May produce at lower level.
- **Navigation Reveal:** Each player reveals 2 cards from navigation deck:
  - Lower-value card: choose energy or project cards equal to value. Discard card.
  - Higher-value card: place on top of discard pile. Its value is used in movement phase.

#### 2. Movement Phase (in turn order)
- Move airship using movement points:
  - Value of top card in navigation discard pile  
  - +1 from solar panel (optional)  
  - +1 per movement upgrade  
  - + movement from project cards  
- Spend movement points to enter spaces (1–3 required per space).
- Must end on a city space.
- Receive finds when entering a space (only once per turn).
- Solar panel: if not used for movement, gain 2 energy.
- First visit to a city: may fight militia.
  - Combat value = combat upgrades + project card values + drawn navigation cards
  - Draw navigation cards: 1st costs 1 energy, each additional costs 2 energy or 3 VP
  - Win if combat value ≥ city’s combat value → gain reward
- Place leftmost round track marker on current city. Take reward if shown (1 metal or 1 energy).

#### 3. Action Phase (in turn order)
Active player chooses one city action:

**A. Collect Resources**  
1. Choose sector (1, 2, or 3).  
2. Place drone on a resource space. Other players place drones on remaining spaces in same sector.  
3. Draw top city card from sleeve, add to navigation discard pile.  
4. Active player takes new growth bonus (if any; in Scenarios 2–3/Chapters 3–7) or water (Scenarios 1/Chapters 1–2).  
5. Each player receives resources based on region size:
   - Largest: 3 resources  
   - Second: 2  
   - Two smallest: 1 each  
6. Bonus actions:
   - **Navigation Update:** Remove one card from discard pile, return to box.  
   - **Wrench:** Gain 1 resource or build 1 upgrade.  
7. Return drones to loading dock.

**B. Build**  
Active player may take up to 2 build actions. Others take 1 each.  
- **Upgrade Airship:** Pay cost of next available upgrade (movement, combat, or new growth). Gain permanent benefit. Last in category gives +5 water.  
- **Play Project Card:** Pay cost (water, project cards). Place under matching phase on airship board. Gain effect and possible VP.  
- If unable or unwilling to build, take 1 resource of choice.

**C. Plant New Growth** (B-side only)  
Available only in Scenarios 2–3 and Chapters 3–7.  
- Planting ability = 2 + number of new growth upgrades.  
- Choose up to that many tiles from personal supply.  
- Take rewards in any order:  
  - **Wilted Tile:** Choose 4 energy OR 2 new growth (add to supply, cannot plant this turn)  
    OR Draw 4 project cards OR 4 water  
    OR Gain 1 metal and take a build action  
  - **Green Tile:** Score 2 VP, then place tile on board if possible:
    - Empty space  
    - Not part of city or legacy tile  
    - Adjacent to airship or connected via planted tiles  
    - Covering a find grants its reward again  
- If no space, score VP but return tile to bag.  
- Other players each get 1 build action (or resource).

Phase ends when all players have acted once.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Production:** Spend energy to gain water and VP. Level increases via project cards.
- **Navigation Deck:** Core engine. Cards fuel movement and provide energy/project cards. Deck refreshes when empty.
- **Combat:** Optional in cities. Draw navigation cards to boost combat value at cost.
- **Upgrades:** Permanent improvements in movement, combat, or planting.
- **Project Cards:** One-time or ongoing effects, often VP-generating.
- **New Growth:** Two types: wilted (immediate rewards) and green (VP + board presence).
- **Legacy Tiles:** Activate special abilities or modify cities.
- **Mission Cards:** Score VP based on end-game conditions. Players hide one mission when receiving a second card.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after the round when the last round track marker is placed.

**Final Steps (all players simultaneously):**  
1. **Produce:** One final production phase.  
2. **Build:** Two build actions (if unable, take resource per action).

**Final Scoring (in order):**  
1. Missions: Score VP based on success level.  
2. Legacy Tiles: VP for markers in cities with matching legacy tiles.  
3. Upgrades: VP for highest-level upgrade in each type.  
4. Project Cards: VP from played cards.

- Pass 50 VP: take 50 tile. Pass 50 again: flip to 100.  
- Unused resources have no value.

**Winning:**  
Most VP wins.  
Tie: All tied players fight one final combat (no VP payment allowed). Winner wins. If tie persists, multiple winners.

**Campaign Victory:**  
Complete campaign by earning 30 of 37 stars (based on VP and mission success).
