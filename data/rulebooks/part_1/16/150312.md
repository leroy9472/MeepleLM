## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Dungeon of Mandom*, players take on the role of brave (or reckless) heroes who enter a dangerous dungeon stripped of most gear, relying on courage and strategy to survive. The goal is to prove your bravery by successfully challenging the dungeon twice. Alternatively, eliminate all other players by causing them to fail two challenges, and you are declared the winner.

### 2. Components  
- **Hero Tile (1x)**: Represents the hero with a starting HP of 3.
- **Item Tiles (6x)**: Equipable items that increase HP or grant special abilities. Examples include the Torch and Holy Grail, which can block certain monsters.
- **Monster Cards (13x)**: Each card shows a monster’s attack power and may include icons indicating which items can block its attack.
- **Player Cards (4x)**: Track each player’s status. Starts white side up; flipping to red indicates a failed challenge. Turning it sideways marks one successful challenge.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the **Hero Tile** face up in the center of the table.  
2. Place all **Item Tiles** near the Hero Tile, fully equipped at the start of each round.  
3. Shuffle the **Monster Cards** and form a face-down draw pile within reach of all players.  
4. Give each player one **Player Card**, placed white side up in front of them.  
5. Determine the first player: the one who most recently challenged the dungeon, or decide via Rock-Paper-Scissors.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in **rounds**, each ending when one player challenges the dungeon. Rounds continue until a player wins.

#### Turn Order (Clockwise)
On a player’s turn, choose one of the following actions:

1. **Draw a Monster Card**  
   After drawing (secretly), choose:
   - **A. Place the Monster**  
     Place the drawn monster card face down on the central dungeon pile. If there is already a pile, place it on top. Stack visibly so height can be seen.
   - **B. Remove an Item**  
     Choose one equipped item to unequip. Place the item tile face down in front of you, on top of the drawn monster card. This hides both the monster and the item from others.  
     > Note: Equipped items are shared. Removing items may reduce HP or remove defensive abilities.

2. **Pass**  
   - Forfeit any further actions this round.  
   - Cannot challenge the dungeon later in this round.  
   - Turn passes to the next player.

#### Ending the Bidding Phase  
- When all but one player has passed, the last remaining player **must challenge the dungeon**.
- If the **Vorpal Sword** is equipped, the challenger may **call out one monster type** to ignore (i.e., take no damage from that monster during the challenge).

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Challenging the Dungeon  
The challenger flips over each monster card in the dungeon pile, one at a time, starting from the top.

For each monster:
- If the hero has an **equipped item** that blocks the monster (as shown by matching icon), **no damage is taken**.
- If no such item is equipped, the hero takes **damage equal to the monster’s attack power**.

> Damage is cumulative. Total damage is compared to hero HP **after all monsters are revealed**.

#### Hero HP Calculation  
- Base HP: 3  
- Some items may increase HP or provide immunity.
- **Equipped items at the time of challenge** determine defense and HP modifiers.

#### Challenge Outcome  
- **Success**: Total damage < Hero HP  
  - Player turns their **Player Card sideways**.  
  - If already sideways, the player **wins the game**.
- **Failure**: Total damage ≥ Hero HP  
  - Player flips their **Player Card red side up**.  
  - If already red, the player **drops out of the game**.

#### End of Round  
- All players reveal cards they withheld (from removing items).  
- **All Item Tiles are re-equipped** for the next round.  
- **Monster Cards are shuffled** into a new draw pile.  
- **No damage carries over** between rounds.  
- The **previous challenger starts the next round**.  
  - If they dropped out, the next active player to the left begins.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Winning Conditions** (Either):
  - A player successfully completes **two dungeon challenges** (marked by turning player card sideways, then winning on second success).
  - **All other players drop out** (have failed two challenges), making the last remaining player the winner.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I lie about what I did?**  
  Yes. Bluffing is allowed. Players may lie about what card they drew or which item they removed.

- **What if I draw a monster but can’t remove an item?**  
  If **no items are equipped**, you **cannot choose to remove an item**. You must **place the monster in the dungeon**.

- **What if there are no monster cards left to draw?**  
  You **cannot draw**. You must **pass**.

- **Can I challenge if I passed earlier?**  
  No. Once you pass, you are out of the round and **cannot challenge**.

- **Does the Vorpal Sword protect automatically?**  
  No. It gives the challenger the **option** to name one monster type to ignore during the challenge.

- **Are item effects cumulative?**  
  Yes. All equipped items contribute their effects (HP boosts, immunities) during the challenge.
