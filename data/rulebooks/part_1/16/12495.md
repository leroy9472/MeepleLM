4. Gameplay Flow  
- Turns proceed clockwise.  
- On a turn, a player may perform Actions, Tasks, and Other Activities in any order, any number of times, until they pass.  
- Actions consume 1 Day each; maximum 7 Days per turn (tracked by Preparation and Sailing sliders).  
- When combined sliders = 7, no more Actions may be taken (but Tasks and Other Activities still allowed).  
- Turn ends when:  
  - Player loses last crew (return to Wintering Zone, discard goods)  
  - Player chooses to move to Wintering Zone (discard goods, keep 1 crew)  
  - Player declares turn over (often after using 7 Days)  
- At end of turn:  
  - Discard goods or crew covering skulls on Losses Chart  
  - Reset Preparation and Sailing sliders to 0  
  - Play passes clockwise

5. Core Mechanics

  - Place 1 crew or 1 good into an open slot on longship.  
  - Move Preparation slider +1.  
  - Must end Load with at least 1 crew aboard.  
  - After loading, move longship to a Homeland (Denmark, Norway, Sweden).  
  - Era Limits:  
    - Era 1: 5 slots  
    - Era 2: 6 slots  
    - Era 3: 7 slots

  - Draw 1 Rune card into hand.  
  - Move Preparation slider +1.  
  - Max 3 Rune cards in hand.  
  - Cannot discard Runes while in Homeland.  
  - If Rune Deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  

- Sail:  
  - Move longship to adjacent water space, port, or Homeland.  
  - Move Sailing slider +1.  
  - Multiple longships may share water spaces or Homelands; only 1 per non-Homeland port.  
  - Weather Zones (N, S, E, W):  
    - Each has Clear Weather Days (shown on Wind Dial).  
    - If Sailing slider > Clear Weather Days of destination zone, take losses:  
      - Cover uncovered skulls on Losses Chart with goods or crew (player choice).  
      - Cover all skulls to the left of the indicated one.  
      - Skulls covered once per turn remain covered.  
    - Must always have ≥1 crew aboard to remain at sea.  

**Tasks (No Days, 1 per port per turn):**  
- Trade:  
  - Remove 1 good from longship and place in port.  
  - Gain VP = port value.  
  - If good matches Goods in Demand, gain +2 VP.

  - No two ports in same region may have same good.  
  - Independent and large ports have no regional restrictions.  

- Raid:  
  - Attempt to remove town from port.  
  - Roll 1 die per attempt (up to 3 attempts).  
  - Compare roll to port value (–1 if goods token present).  
  - If roll > value: success. Take town, reveal treasure value, gain VP, keep town.  
  - If roll ≤ value: discard 1 crew. May retry if ≥1 crew remains.  
  - Max 3 attempts.  
  - Rune cards referencing "attacks" apply to Raiding.  

- Settle:  
  - Attempt to place 1 crew as settlement in townless port.  
  - Roll up to 3 dice (1 per crew, all at once).  
  - Port value –1 if goods token present.  
  - For each roll ≤ value: discard 1 crew.  
  - If any roll > value: may place 1 crew as settlement.  
  - Cannot settle if:  
    - Port has a town (must Raid first)  
    - Any port in same region has a town (regional restriction)  
  - Independent and large ports have no regional restrictions.  
  - Rune cards referencing "attacks" apply to Settling.

6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger:**  
- When last face-down Saga is revealed, player who reveals it takes all 3 Final Round Tokens.  
- Game ends in one of two ways:  
  1. If final Saga is completed (all three Saga spaces empty), game ends immediately.  
  2. Otherwise, after player with Final Round Tokens has taken 3 full turns (placing one token per turn), game ends at end of their third turn.  

**Final Scoring:**  
- **Bloodied Axe Bonus:**  
  +3 VP per town for player(s) with most towns collected (tied players all receive).  
- **Settlements:**  
  - Port VP = port value  
  - ×2 if 2 ports in region are settled (by anyone)  
  - ×3 if all 3 ports in region are settled (by anyone)  
  - Independent and large ports are not in regions; scored at base value only.  
- **Saga Sets:**  
  - Sort Sagas by Homeland (Denmark, Sweden, Norway).  
  - For each Homeland:  
    - Most Sagas: +10 VP per Saga  
    - Second Most: +5 VP per Saga  
  - Tie for 1st: both get +10 VP per Saga, no 2nd place awarded.  
  - Tie for 2nd: both get +5 VP per Saga.  
- Total all VP (including in-hand, on board, and bonuses).  
- Most VP wins. Tie: all tied players win (declared shield-brothers).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Running out of Crew:**  
  - If a player builds 15 Settlements, they have no crew left.  
  - They must sit out but still score normally.  
  - If all players run out of crew, game ends immediately.  
- **Goods in Demand:**  
  - Starts as Fish. Can be changed by Rune cards.  
  - Only affects Trade bonus (+2 VP).  
- **Wind Dial Rotation:**  
  - Can be changed only when playing or discarding a Rune.  
  - Must be done before resolving Rune effect (if played).  
- **Saga Completion:**  
  - Only the player who provides the final requirement scores the Saga.  
  - Others who contributed get nothing.  
- **Settlement Attempt with Last Crew:**  
  - Player may choose not to place the crew as settlement to avoid becoming crewless.  
- **Multiple Longships in Zones:**  
  - Unlimited in water spaces and Homelands.  
  - Only 1 per non-Homeland port.
