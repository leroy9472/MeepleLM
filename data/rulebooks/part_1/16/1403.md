## Turn the Tide — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
**Objective**: Score the most points over a series of rounds by maintaining a low tide level and preserving life preservers. Each remaining face-up life preserver is worth 1 point. Additional points and penalties are awarded based on end-of-round conditions.

### 2. Components  
- 60 Weather Cards (yellow back, numbered 1–60)  
- 24 Tide Level Cards (blue back, also referred to as Water Level cards)  
- 24 Life Preserver Tokens (red, also referred to as Life Preserver cards)  
- 1 Score Pad & Pencil  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Shuffle Decks**:  
   - Shuffle the 24 Tide Level cards and place them face down in the center.  
   - Shuffle the 60 Weather cards.  
2. **Deal Weather Cards**:  
   - Deal 12 Weather cards face down to each player.  
   - Return any leftover Weather cards to the box.  
3. **Determine Life Preservers**:  
   - Each player counts the number of full and half life preservers shown on their 12 Weather cards.  
   - Each full life preserver = 1 token; two halves = 1 token; round down if total is a half (e.g., 3.5 → 3).  
4. **Distribute Tokens**:  
   - Players take the corresponding number of life preserver tokens and place them face up in front of them.  
   - Return unused tokens to the box.  
5. **Prepare Tide Deck**:  
   - Place the shuffled Tide Level cards face down in the middle.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of **as many rounds as there are players** (e.g., 3 players = 3 rounds).  
Each round consists of **12 hands**. Each hand follows 5 steps:

#### Hand Steps:
1. **Reveal Two Tide Cards**:  
   - The top two cards of the Tide Level deck are turned face up and placed on opposite sides of the deck.
2. **Simultaneous Bid**:  
   - Each player selects one Weather card from their hand and places it face down in front of them.  
   - When all players have chosen, cards are revealed simultaneously.
3. **Assign Tide Level Cards**:  
   - The player with the **highest-numbered Weather card** takes the **lower** of the two revealed Tide Level cards.  
   - The player with the **second-highest Weather card** takes the **higher** Tide Level card.  
   - Players place the new Tide Level card face up in their area, **replacing** any previous one (only the current one matters).
4. **Lose a Life Preserver**:  
   - The player with the **highest Tide Level card currently showing** turns one life preserver face down.  
   - In case of a tie for highest, **all tied players** turn one life preserver face down.
5. **Discard Weather Card**:  
   - Each player places their used Weather card into a personal face-down discard pile.  
   - Tide Level cards remain visible in front of players.

Repeat these steps until all 12 Weather cards are played or the round ends early.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Tide Level Management**: Only the most recently acquired Tide Level card counts for each player.  
- **Life Preserver Tracking**: Players start with face-up tokens; turning one face down indicates loss.  
- **Round Elimination**:  
  - If a player turns over their **last** life preserver, they remain in the round.  
  - If they are required to lose **another** life preserver while having **none face up**, they are **eliminated**.  
  - Eliminated players discard their remaining Weather cards face down and take no further part in the round.  
- **Early Round End**: The round ends immediately if only **two or fewer** players remain active.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
At the end of each round:
- **1 point** per **face-up** life preserver.  
- **0 points** if a player has no life preservers left.  
- **–1 point** if the player was **eliminated** during the round.  
- **+1 bonus point** for the player with the **lowest** Tide Level card showing.  
  - If tied, **each tied player** receives the bonus.  
  - A player with **no Tide Level card** has the lowest possible level and qualifies for the bonus.

**Round Rotation**:  
- After scoring, each player passes their **12 Weather cards** and **corresponding life preserver tokens** (face up) to the player on their **left**.  
- Re-shuffle the Tide Level cards and begin a new round.

**Final Scoring**:  
- After all rounds (equal to number of players), sum all round scores.  
- The player with the **highest total score** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What if two players tie for highest Weather card?**  
  - The tie is broken arbitrarily (e.g., clockwise from dealer), but both are considered for Tide assignment. The higher Weather card wins; if truly tied, house rule or random break is acceptable. (Source implies unique numbers; no ties possible — all Weather cards are uniquely numbered 1–60.)

- **Can a player have no Tide Level card?**  
  - Yes. If they never won a bid, they have no card. This counts as the **lowest possible** tide level for bonus scoring.

- **What happens if only two players are left mid-round?**  
  - The round ends **immediately**.

- **Do Weather cards go back into the deck?**  
  - No. Each player uses their 12-card hand for the entire round. Cards are passed to the left for the next round.

- **Is the life preserver distribution fair?**  
  - Players with more life preservers tend to have harder-to-play Weather cards (higher concentration in mid-range numbers), balancing advantage.
