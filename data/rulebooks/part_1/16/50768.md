## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In 12th-century Japan, the Minamoto and Taira clans vie for power while retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa manipulates from behind the scenes. Players take on the role of ninja seeking to exploit the chaos through daring raids, skill mastery, and political intrigue. The goal is to accumulate the most honor by the end of the game and become the Ninjato—the Invisible Sword of the ruling family.

### 2. Components
- 1 Game Board with locations: Dojo, Sensei, Palace, Pavilion, and 5 Clan Houses
- 15 Clan tokens (5 each for Taira/red, Minamoto/blue, Go-Shirakawa/green)
- 19 Sensei Skill tiles (including 3 Hensojutsu/Disguise tiles)
- 90 Treasure tokens (Fan, Scroll, Vase, Jade, Gold; values 2–5)
- 12 Shuriken (3 per player in player colors)
- 12 Wooden markers (3 per player: 1 for turn order, 2 for honor tracking)
- 52 Dojo cards (values 1–5; includes kicker 3s)
- 21 Envoy cards (representing influence in clans)
- 40 Guard cards (regular) and 20 Elite Guard cards
- 30 Rumor cards
- 1 Bag (for drawing treasures)
- 1 Round marker

### 3. Setup
1. Place the board in the center. Each player takes 3 shuriken and 3 matching wooden markers.
2. Determine starting turn order: place one marker per player into a container, draw randomly, and place on Turn Order Track (1).
3. Place remaining player markers at start of Honor Track.
4. Shuffle Guard and Elite Guard decks separately. Place one face-up Guard card (sentry) on each Clan House.
5. Assign Clan tokens: place 2 and 4 honor Taira (red) tokens on two houses; same for Minamoto (blue); place 6 honor Go-Shirakawa (green) token on the last house. Remaining tokens form a supply.
6. Place 3 random treasures (from bag), plain side up, in each house.
7. Separate the 3 Hensojutsu (Disguise) skill tiles, shuffle, and form a face-down stack near Sensei (⑧). Shuffle remaining skill tiles into a large face-down stack (⑨). Draw number of face-up skills equal to player count and place in Sensei area.
8. Shuffle Envoy cards, place 4 face-up near Palace; rest form a face-down stack.
9. Shuffle Rumor cards, place 4 face-up near Pavilion; rest form a face-down stack.
10. Shuffle Dojo deck, deal 4 cards to each player. Reveal 3 face-up cards near Dojo; rest form a draw pile.
11. Place round marker on 1 of Round Track.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Action Phase (7 rounds total):**
   - In turn order, each player places one shuriken on an action location (Dojo, Sensei, Clan House, Palace, Pavilion).
   - Shuriken may stack; same player or others may reuse locations.
   - Players place all 3 shuriken over the round, one per turn.
   - After all shuriken are placed, proceed to End of Round.

2. **End of Round:**
   - Update turn order based on Dojo shuriken stack (topmost goes first next round).
   - Reset all used skills (flip face-up).
   - Reset Sensei: discard unclaimed skills; refill with new face-up skills (equal to player count for rounds 1–4; only one Disguise tile for rounds 5–7).
   - Reset cleared houses: add 3 plain treasures and a new sentry (ignore alarm if drawn).
   - Refill Palace and Pavilion to 4 face-up cards each.
   - Advance round marker.

3. **Scoring Phases (after rounds 3, 5, 7):**
   - For each clan, determine 1st and 2nd in envoy influence.
   - Apply rewards: 1st chooses between house honor or free rumor; 2nd takes remaining.
   - Refill Pavilion.

4. **End Game (after round 7):**
   - Conduct final bonus scoring for Rumors, unused treasures, and defeated Elite Guards.
   - Determine winner.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Dojo
- Place shuriken to draw Dojo cards.
- Draw:
  - 4 cards if 0 in hand
  - 3 cards if 1 in hand
  - 2 cards if 2+ in hand
- Replace drawn face-up cards immediately.
- Hand limit: 7 cards (discard down if exceeded).
- At round end, Dojo shuriken stack determines next turn order (topmost = first).

#### Clan Houses
- Place shuriken on **Strength** or **Stealth** side.
- **Strength**: play Dojo card > guard value.
- **Stealth**: play Dojo card < guard value.
- Ties lose.
- **Kicker (3 card)**: may be played as normal card or as +1/–1 modifier to another card. Multiple kickers allowed.
- Defeat guard → take lowest available treasure (plain first, then red; ascending value).
- Decide: **Leave** or call **Banzai** to face next guard.
  - **Leave**: take all treasures on shuriken; add 1 plain treasure to house; sentry remains.
  - **Banzai**: reveal next guard. If next treasure is plain → draw regular guard; if red → draw elite guard.
  - **Fail**: take only 1 treasure from shuriken; add 1 plain treasure to house; sentry remains.
- **Alarm Guard**:
  - Draw 1 treasure, place plain side up.
  - Flip most valuable plain treasure to red side.
  - Ignore alarms on sentry.
- **Defeat All Guards**:
  - Take all remaining treasures.
  - Replace clan token with different clan’s token.
  - House is empty for rest of round (no shuriken placement).
- **Elite Guards**:
  - Must defeat both if dual-value.
  - Keep defeated elite guard card for end-game scoring.
  - Normal guards are discarded.

#### Sensei
- Discard Dojo card shown on skill tile to learn skill.
- “?” = discard any Dojo card.
- Once a style (Snake, Tiger, Crane) is learned, future skills of that style are free.
- Skills may be used once per round (flip tile face-down when used).
- Reset all skills to face-up at end of round.
- **Rounds 1–4**: number of face-up skills = player count.
- **Rounds 5–7**: only one face-up skill available — Hensojutsu (Disguise).

#### Palace
- Discard required treasures to take one face-up Envoy card.
- Score honor equal to value of treasures discarded.
- Gold = wild (can substitute for any treasure).
- Envoy placed face-up; contributes 1 influence per clan.
- Tiebreaker for influence: oldest envoy (highest number).

#### Pavilion
- Discard required treasures to take one face-up Rumor card.
- Score honor equal to value of treasures discarded.
- Gold = wild.
- Rumor card kept face-down until end of game.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Scoring Phases (after rounds 3, 5, 7)
- For each clan (in order on Round Track):
  1. Players with Hensojutsu (Disguise) declare target (must have ⊕ icon on Envoy).
  2. Determine 1st and 2nd in envoy influence (tiebreaker: oldest Envoy).
  3. 1st place chooses:
     - Score total honor on that clan’s houses (sum of token values), OR
     - Take one free Rumor card from Pavilion.
  4. 2nd place takes the unchosen option.
- Refill Pavilion to 4 face-up cards.

#### End of Game Bonus Scoring
- **Rumors**:
  - Most Rumor types act as multipliers for collected items:
    - 1 matching Rumor = ×1
    - 2 matching = ×2
    - 3 matching = ×4
    - 4+ starts new set
  - Multiplied items:
    - "Greatest Warrior" → number of defeated Elite Guards
    - "Goodwill of the People" → number of Rumor cards
    - "Powerful Friends" → number of Envoys
    - "Master of the Secret Art" → number of Skill tiles
  - **Dishonorable Opponents**:
    - No multiplier.
    - If only one player has it: 6 honor per card.
    - If two players have it: 4 honor per card.
    - If three or more: 2 honor per card.
- **Unused Treasures**: 1 honor per treasure (any type).
- **Defeated Elite Guards**: score honor shown on card (1 or 2 each).

#### Winning
- Highest total honor wins.
- Tiebreakers:
  1. Most Envoys.
  2. Oldest Envoy (highest number, any clan).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Skills**: Can only be used during Clan House invasions. Cannot be used to gain skills or play tactics cards.
- **Rumor/Envoy Refill**: Refill to 4 face-up cards (not replace). Done before scoring rounds and again after.
- **Alarm Timing**: Trigger immediately when alarm guard is revealed. Draw treasure, then flip highest plain treasure to red.
- **Espionage (Choho)**: Swap treasure during invasion (even after failure). If red treasure is returned to house, flip highest remaining plain treasure to red.
- **Elite Guard Loss**: Same as regular guard — take 1 treasure, add 1 plain treasure to house.
- **Sentry Persistence**: Only original sentry remains between attacks. If house is fully cleared, sentry is discarded.
- **Hidden Info**: Only Dojo cards and Rumor cards are secret.
- **Kicker + Tactics**: Can use kicker with tactics skill (e.g., Boryaku acts as 2 or 4 card and can be modified).
- **Disguise Assignment**: Players declare targets in turn order during scoring phases.
- **Gold Use**: Can fulfill any treasure requirement; scores as that treasure.
