## Medina – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In the year 1822, players collaborate to rebuild the medina at the foot of the Atlas Mountains. The goal is to construct and expand palaces, fortify city walls, and develop the bustling market street. Players earn points by controlling palaces, placing components adjacent to them, and claiming special tiles. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

### 2. Components
- 1 double-sided game board (10×14 for 2 players, 11×16 for 3–4 players)  
- 4 white towers (placed in corners)  
- 4 tower tiles (numbered 1–3, one blank)  
- 4 palace tiles (one per color: orange, grey, purple, brown)  
- 6 tea tiles (3, 2, 1 point values)  
- 16 rooftops (4 per player color; neutral rooftops used in 2–3 player games)  
- 80 buildings (20 each in 4 colors)  
- 12 stables  
- 36 walls  
- 1 well  
- 31 merchants  
- 4 player screens  
- 1 score block  

### 3. Setup
1. **Board**: Use small grid (10×14) for 2 players, large grid (11×16) for 3–4 players.  
2. **Towers**: Place white towers in the four corners. Place matching tower tiles next to them.  
   - Tower tile #1: 3 merchants  
   - #2: 2 merchants  
   - #3: 1 merchant  
   - #4: 0 merchants  
3. **Well**: Place randomly on an interior space, at least 1 space from any wall.  
4. **Initial Merchant**: Place 1 merchant on any interior space, not adjacent to the well or walls.  
5. **Palace Tiles**: Place face-up in a row at the top of the board.  
6. **Tea Tiles**: Stack face-up at the top-left of the board.  
7. **Player Components** (kept behind screens except rooftops, which go in front):  

| Players | Buildings (per color) | Rooftops (own) | Neutral Rooftops | Stables | Merchants | Walls |
|--------|------------------------|----------------|------------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 2      | 8                      | 4              | 2 (shared color) | 4      | 12        | 15    |
| 3      | 6                      | 4              | 1                | 4      | 8         | 12    |
| 4      | 5                      | 4              | 0                | 3      | 6         | 9     |

8. **Starting Player**: Randomly choose one.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Play proceeds clockwise starting with the first player.  
- On a turn, a player places **two wooden components** (buildings, rooftops, stables, merchants, or walls) on empty legal spaces.  
- **First Turn Exceptions**:  
  - 2-player: Starting player places only **1 component** on first turn.  
  - 3–4 player: First **two players** place only **1 component** on their first turn.  
- Players may spend **1 tea tile per turn** to skip placing one of the two required components (must still place at least one).  
- When a player runs out of components, they remove their screen and no longer take turns.  
- Game ends when **all players** have placed all components.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Buildings
- Used to construct palaces of the same color.  
- A new palace of a color can be started only if:  
  - No buildings of that color are on the board, OR  
  - All existing palaces of that color have rooftops, OR  
  - No existing palace of that color can be legally expanded.  
- If an unroofed palace of that color exists, new buildings **must be placed orthogonally adjacent** to it.  
- Palaces must be separated by **at least one space** (orthogonal and diagonal) — no adjacent or corner-touching.  
- Once a palace has a rooftop, no more buildings can be added.

#### Rooftops
- Placed on any unroofed palace to claim control.  
- Each player has 4 rooftops and can claim **1 palace per color**.  
- When a player places a rooftop:  
  - Palace is locked (no more buildings).  
  - Player takes the **palace tile** of that color (if first to claim).  
  - If palace borders a wall segment, player may take the **tower tile**.  
- If **all players** have claimed a palace of a given color (with their own rooftops), all remaining buildings of that color behind player screens are returned to the box.  
- **Neutral Rooftops (2–3 players)**:  
  - Can be placed on any palace, even if another neutral rooftop is already on that color.  
  - Palace does **not** score for any player.  
  - If all players (not counting neutral) have claimed a palace in a color, remove all buildings of that color.

#### Stables
- Can be added to **any palace**, regardless of ownership or rooftop status.  
- Must be placed **orthogonally adjacent** to any building in a palace.  
- Must maintain **1-space separation** from other palaces (including diagonals).  
- Each stable adds **+1 point** to the palace at scoring.  
- Stables count toward palace size for **palace tile** competition.

#### Merchants
- Represent the market street.  
- Must be placed **orthogonally adjacent** to an existing merchant, at **either end** of the line.  
- May never be adjacent to **more than one** other merchant.  
- Market street may not branch.  
- If **both ends are blocked**, a player may place a merchant on **any legal empty space**, starting a new market street.  
- Merchants may be placed adjacent to palaces, walls, and the well.  
- At scoring: each merchant adjacent to a building or stable in a **controlled palace** gives **+1 point** to that palace.

#### Walls
- Placed on wall spaces surrounding the city.  
- Must start adjacent to a **tower** or existing wall.  
- On each side, two wall segments grow toward center but **must not connect** — a **virtual gate** of at least 1 space must remain open.  
- Walls may be built adjacent to any palace (with or without rooftops).  
- Each wall piece adjacent to a controlled palace gives **+1 point** at scoring.  
- If a player builds a wall adjacent to a palace they control, or extends a palace to touch a wall, they may gain the **tower tile**.

#### Tea Tiles
- Awarded when a player **places a rooftop** on a **purple palace**:  
  - 1st to complete: 3 tea tiles  
  - 2nd: 2 tea tiles  
  - 3rd: 1 tea tile  
  - 4th: 0  
- **Neutral rooftop on purple palace (2–3 players)**: Tea tiles for that placement are **removed from the game**.  
- **Use**: Spend **1 tea tile per turn** to skip placing one component (must still place at least one).  
- Tea tiles have **no point value**.

#### The Well
- No buildings or stables may be placed in the **8 surrounding spaces**.  
- Only merchants may occupy those spaces.  
- At scoring: each building or stable in a **controlled palace** that is **orthogonally adjacent** to the well (i.e., separated by exactly 1 space) earns **+4 points**.

#### Palace Tiles
- The **first player** to claim a palace of a color takes the matching palace tile.  
- If another player later claims a **larger** palace (by total components: buildings + stables) of the same color, they take the tile.  
- Size is recalculated if a stable is added to an existing palace.  
- **2–3 players**: If a **neutral rooftop** controls the largest palace of a color, the palace tile is **returned to the board edge** (no player scores it).

#### Tower Tiles
- A player gains a tower tile if:  
  - They claim a palace **orthogonally adjacent** to a wall segment connected to that tower, OR  
  - They build a stable that causes their palace to become adjacent to such a wall.  
- The **most recent** player to meet this condition takes the tile.  
- If there are merchants on the tower tile, the player takes them and adds to their supply.  
- **2–3 players**: If a **neutral rooftop** controls the adjacent palace, the tower tile is **returned to the board edge**, and any merchants are **discarded**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends when all players have placed all components.

**Scoring (per controlled palace)**:
- +1 point per **building**  
- +1 point per **stable**  
- +1 point per **wall piece** orthogonally adjacent to any building or stable in the palace  
- +1 point per **merchant** orthogonally adjacent to any building or stable in the palace  
- **Palace tile** held at end: score value on tile (1–4)  
- **Tower tile** held at end: score value on tile (1–4)  
- **Well bonus**: +4 points per **building or stable** in the palace that is **one space away (orthogonal)** from the well

**Total**: Sum all above. Highest score wins. **No tiebreakers**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I place a stable next to an opponent’s palace?**  
  Yes. It becomes part of that palace and benefits the owner. Use strategically to block or score.

- **What if I can’t place both components?**  
  You must place as many as possible. If you have tea tiles, you can spend one to skip one placement.

- **Can a wall touch a gate (from expansion)?**  
  No — unless a gate is placed, the wall segments must leave a gap. A gate defines the endpoint.

- **Does a stable count toward palace size for palace tile?**  
  Yes — palace size = number of buildings + stables.

- **Can I place a merchant next to the well?**  
  Yes — merchants are allowed in the 8 spaces around the well.

- **What happens if I claim a palace adjacent to a wall, but someone else already has the tower tile?**  
  You take the tower tile from them. The most recent qualifying player always holds it.

- **Can I place a building of a color if all palaces of that color are roofed?**  
  Yes — you may start a new palace of that color, provided no unroofed one exists.
