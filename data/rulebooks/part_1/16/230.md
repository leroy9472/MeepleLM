## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Merchant of Venus*, players are interstellar traders navigating a post-collapse galaxy to amass wealth through exploration, trade, and investment. The goal is to be the first to reach a predetermined Net Worth (typically 2,000 Galactic Credits), calculated as the sum of cash and the full value of owned Deeds (Spaceports and Factories). Only cash and Deeds count toward victory; Goods, Equipment, Ships, Fares, and Relics do not.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows this sequence:  
1. **Declare Direction** – Choose initial movement direction.  
2. **Movement Phase** – Roll dice (number based on ship speed).  
   - Total roll = Movement Points (MP).  
   - Must move full MP unless stopped by penalty, landing, or inability to move.  
   - No backtracking (cannot move A→B→A in same turn).  
   - Landing/takeoff from Surface City costs 2 MP.  
   - May land on Surface City, Space City, Spaceport, Asteroid, or Open Port.  
   - Passing through Orbit allows peeking at I.O.U.  
3. **Trade Phase** – Occurs after movement ends on a trade-eligible space.  
   - **At Surface/Space City (first landing)**: 1 buy, 1 sell/barter (IOUs and Fares exempt).  
   - **At Spaceport or non-moving turn**: Unlimited trades.  
   - May trade with other players on same Asteroid, City, or Spaceport (no Deeds or Ships).  
4. **End of Turn** – Discard excess cargo if over capacity. Turn ends.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Exploration & Culture Discovery  
- **Observing**: Passing through Orbit allows secret peek at I.O.U.  
- **Discovering**: Landing on Surface City, Space City, or Spaceport reveals culture.  
  - Take I.O.U. (usable later).  
  - Place Culture Marker, Goods, and accumulated Bonus Markers (Fares/Demands) on Market Board.  

#### Trading  
- **Buying**: Pay Bank for Goods, Equipment, Ships, or Deeds.  
  - 20% discount on own-race Deeds.  
- **Selling**: Sell Goods to cultures that accept them (check Good’s back).  
  - Bank pays sale value.  
  - Sold Goods go to bag; draw replacement immediately.  
- **Bartering**:  
  - IOUs: Trade with issuing culture only; full value; no limit.  
  - Equipment/Relics: Trade for half value; counts as one sell.  
  - Ships: Trade-in for half value; all cargo/equipment transfers.  
- **Fares**:  
  - Pick up free; deliver to destination for cash.  
  - Not subject to trade limits.  
- **Jettisoning**: Discard Goods, Equipment, or Fares (not same turn as purchase). Triggers Bonus Cup draw.  

#### Deeds & Investments  
- **Spaceport Deed (₵200)**:  
  - Place marker in Orbit.  
  - Owner earns 10% commission on all trades (Bank pays).  
  - Enables unlimited trading at that port.  
- **Factory Deed (₵100 or ₵200)**:  
  - Place marker in system.  
  - Owner earns 50% commission on Factory Good purchases.  
  - Factory Goods only available after Factory built.  
- **Commissions**:  
  - Stackable (e.g., 10% + 50% if same player owns both).  
  - No commission on commission.  
  - Not earned on Fares or player-to-player trades.  

#### Movement & Navigation  
- **Navigation Circles**: Choose Pilot Number (one die) when exiting; must follow matching-number paths.  
- **Telegates**: Exit via matching-number Telegate (consume 1 MP).  
- **Penalties (Ovals)**: Pay amount or stop.  
  - Shields reduce penalty by ₵20 each.  
  - Drives skip same-color Dots/Penalties.  
- **Exploration Markers**: Reveal when entered. Types:  
  - Relic: Land to claim.  
  - Open Port: Trade freely.  
  - TeleGate/Penalty: Act as normal.  
  - Asteroid: Landing/trading allowed.  

#### Equipment & Relics  
- **Drives**: Skip same-color Dots/Penalties.  
- **Shields**: Reduce penalty by ₵20 each.  
- **Relics** (take no space):  
  - **Auto Pilot**: Roll one less die; automatic “4”.  
  - **Air Foil**: 1 MP to land/takeoff; move between Surface Cities.  
  - **Spy Eye**: Peek at I.O.U. from anywhere; peek adjacent “?” markers.  
  - **Switch Switch**: Change Pilot Number freely.  
  - **Gate Lock**: Disable Telegates for turn.  
  - **Mulligan Gear**: Reroll one die.  
  - **Jump Start**: Start turn as if on Telegate.  

#### Bonus Cup Mechanics  
- Triggered by:  
  - Selling a Good  
  - Jettisoning cargo  
  - Fulfilling a Fare  
- Process:  
  - Return sold/filled marker to bag.  
  - Draw equal number of new markers.  
  - Place on corresponding culture’s Market Board.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition**: First player to reach target Net Worth (e.g., ₵2,000) **at end of turn**.  
- **Net Worth = Cash + Full Value of Deeds**  
- **Game Ends Immediately** if Bank runs out of money; highest Net Worth wins.  
- Goods, Ships, Equipment, Fares, IOUs, and Relics have **no value** at game end.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q**: Can you buy a Spaceport from an empty Orbit?  
  **A**: No. Must be on a City, Spaceport, or Open Port.  
- **Q**: Does trading in a ship/equipment block other sales?  
  **A**: Yes. Trading in equipment/ship counts as one sale. Buying ship/equipment counts as one purchase. IOUs do not count.  
- **Q**: Does Spaceport owner get commission on IOU/ship trades?  
  **A**: Yes. 10% on all transaction values (e.g., IOU trade-in, ship purchase).  
- **Q**: What happens when Jump Start fails?  
  **A**: Move normally using dice roll.  
- **Q**: Can you backtrack via Telegates?  
  **A**: Yes. Jumping from Telegate A to B, then B to A is allowed and not backtracking.  
- **Q**: How are Rastur markers selected?  
  **A**: Based on Rastur Mix Chart (e.g., for ₵1,000 game, use markers ₵60–₵110).
