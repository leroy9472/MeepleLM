## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Lead your team of two climbers to the summit of K2 or one of its challenging neighboring peaks, managing stamina (movement), oxygen (acclimatization), and the mountain’s unpredictable weather. The goal is to maximize your climbers’ combined victory points (VPs) by reaching high altitudes, surviving harsh conditions, and completing special objectives depending on the scenario.

The game ends after 18 days (15 for certain scenarios). The player with the highest combined score wins. In case of a tie, the player whose climber first reached the summit (or a specific peak) wins.

### 2. Components  
- Game board (K2 or variant: Broad Peak, Lhotse)  
- Weather tiles (Summer or Winter sets; includes Avalanche tiles in K2: Avalanche)  
- Risk tokens (values: 0, 1, –1, –2)  
- Player materials per color:  
  - 4 climbers (2 per team)  
  - 2 tents (1 in Broad Peak Traverse)  
  - 1 player board with acclimatization tracks  
  - 2 acclimatization markers  
  - 18-card deck (adjusted in variants)  
  - Start player token  
- Scenario-specific:  
  - Snow Cave markers (Broad Peak: Race to the Top)  
  - Traverse tokens (Broad Peak Traverse)  
  - Fixed Rope (carabiner) tokens (Lhotse: The South Face)  
  - VP tokens (Broad Peak Traverse, Lhotse variants)  
  - Rescue card (Family Variant only)

### 3. Setup  
#### Base Game (K2)  
1. Place board; choose Easier or Harder side.  
2. Choose Summer (easier) or Winter (harder) weather tiles. Shuffle and place one tile to the left of the stack, face up. Place weather marker on its leftmost space.  
3. Place 20 Risk Tokens (4×0, 11×–1, 5×–2) facedown; draw 3 faceup.  
4. At 5 players, agree whether to use larger (easier) or smaller (harder) climber limits above 7000m.  

#### Each Player  
5. Take all components in one color: 4 climbers, 2 tents, player board, 2 acclimatization markers, 18-card deck. In Family Variant, take a Rescue Card.  
6. Place 2 climbers (different shapes) on Base Camp; place other 2 on "1" of the score track.  
7. Place acclimatization markers on "1" of each climber’s track.  
8. Shuffle deck and draw 6 cards.  
9. Last player to have been in the mountains takes Start Player Token.

#### Scenario Additions  
**Broad Peak: Race to the Top**  
- Use Race to the Top board.  
- Remove one weather tile: clear tile (Summer), random tile (Winter).  
- Remove from each deck: one 3, one 2 acclimatization card, one 1 movement card.  
- Remove both tents.  
- Supply Snow Cave markers.  

**Broad Peak: Traverse**  
- Use Broad Peak board.  
- Place VP tokens on each peak as per player count.  
- Place Traverse Tokens beside board.  
- Return one tent to box (only one tent per player available).  

**Lhotse: The South Face**  
- Use Lhotse South Face board.  
- Use Lhotse Weather Tiles:  
  - Deal 2 to each player; each discards one.  
  - Randomly draw discarded tiles to make 6 total tiles.  
- Each player takes a pair of Fixed Rope tokens.  
- Each player places one climber on each starting space.  

**Lhotse: South Col**  
- Use Lhotse South Col board.  
- Use base game weather tiles (Summer/Winter), or Lhotse tiles using only C section:  
  - Discard one random tile; set up remaining tiles as base game.  
- Remove one 2, one 1, one 0 acclimatization card per player (experienced variant: secretly choose).  

**K2: Avalanche**  
- Replace two random regular weather tiles with Avalanche tiles (with avalanche icon).  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 18 rounds (15 in Race to the Top and South Col). Each round has 5 phases:

1. **Card Selection**  
   - Each player selects 3 of 6 hand cards and places them face down.  
   - Reveal all cards simultaneously.

2. **Risk Token**  
   - Players sum upward movement points (green circles) of their 3 selected cards. Rope cards use only upward value; acclimatization cards ignored.  
   - Highest sum takes one of 3 faceup Risk Tokens.  
   - Tie: no token taken.  
   - Draw a new Risk Token to replace any taken.

3. **Action Phase** (in turn order)  
   - Use selected 3 cards to perform actions. Cannot split a card’s points between climbers.  
   - **With Risk Token**: Must apply penalty:  
     - Reduce one card’s movement or acclimatization value by 1 (or split 2-point penalty).  
     - Or reduce acclimatization of a climber who received a card this turn.  
   - **Movement**:  
     - Sum movement points to climb or descend along connected spaces.  
     - Cost to enter space = yellow number (or 1 if none).  
     - Weather (yellow) increases cost in affected zones.  
     - Downward movement (rope cards) only usable when moving down.  
     - Cannot end turn in space exceeding climber limit.  
   - **Pitch Tent**:  
     - Spend movement points equal to space’s entry cost (including weather).  
     - Only upward movement values can be used.  
     - Tent stays permanently; only one tent per climber.  
   - **Build Snow Cave** (Race to the Top):  
     - Cost: 1 MP below 7000m, 2 MP above. Weather does not affect cost.  
     - Place face-up (yellow) marker; only one climber per cave.  
     - Any climber may use any empty cave.  
     - Repair face-down (red) cave by paying build cost and flipping.  
   - **Repack Tent** (Broad Peak Traverse):  
     - Climber with tent on space may spend 1 MP to repack it (place on player board).  
     - Can be pitched again later.  
   - **Fixed Ropes** (Lhotse: South Face):  
     - Spend 1 MP to place pair of carabiners between two spaces:  
       - Both >6000m.  
       - VP difference ≤1.  
       - On adjacent paths (not crossing printed connections).  
     - Creates new connection usable by all.  
     - Higher VP space = higher altitude for rope cards.  
   - **Acclimatization**:  
     - Apply one or more acclimatization cards (blue) to one climber.  
     - Sum values and increase climber’s acclimatization track.

4. **Acclimatization Check**  
   For each climber:  
   - **Space Effects**:  
     - Blue circle: +value  
     - Red circle: –value  
     - Own-color tent: +1  
   - **Weather Effects**:  
     - Red weather: –value in affected zone(s)  
     - Split red/yellow: –value  
   - **Snow Cave** (Race to the Top): +1  
   - **Landslide** (Lhotse variants):  
     - After base effects, in affected zones (by altitude and section):  
       - Lose 2 acclimatization.  
       - Climber and tent move 1 space down (printed ropes only).  
       - Resolve from lowest to highest space.  
       - If multiple paths, stay in same section if possible; else player chooses.  
   - **Avalanche** (K2: Avalanche):  
     - After weather, in affected zones:  
       - In tent/snow cave: lose 1 acclimatization, do not move.  
       - Not in shelter: lose 1 acclimatization, move 1 space down (printed ropes).  
       - Resolve in turn order.  
   - Adjust acclimatization:  
     - >6 → reduce to 6  
     - <1 → climber dies:  
       - Remove from board.  
       - VP marker to 1.  
       - **Family Variant**: Discard Rescue Card to save climber: place below 6000m, VP marker back 4 (min 1).  
       - **Broad Peak Traverse**: Lose all VP and Traverse tokens.

5. **End of Turn**  
   - Pass Start Player Token left.  
   - Advance Weather Marker right.  
     - If moves to next tile: shift that tile to left stack.  
     - If on last tile: 3 rounds remain.  
     - If marker reaches end of last tile: game ends.  
   - Draw 3 cards.  
     - If deck empty: draw nothing (play with current hand).  
     - If hand empty: shuffle discard, draw 6.  
   - **Race to the Top**: Flip all yellow Snow Caves to red; remove all red ones.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Play**: Simultaneous selection, then turn-based action.  
- **Risk Tokens**: Penalty for aggressive movement; must be used during Action Phase.  
- **Acclimatization**: Vital survival track (1–6). Affected by space, shelter, weather, and events.  
- **Movement**: Spent from cards; affected by space cost and weather.  
- **Shelter**: Tents (permanent) or Snow Caves (temporary) grant +1 acclimatization.  
- **Weather**: 6-day forecast; affects movement (yellow) and acclimatization (red).  
- **Events**: Landslides and Avalanches force downward movement and acclimatization loss.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Base Game & Variants (except Broad Peak Traverse)**  
- Game ends after 18 rounds (15 for Race to the Top, South Col).  
- Score: sum of both climbers’ VP markers.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player whose climber first reached summit wins.

**Broad Peak Traverse**  
- Game ends after 18 rounds.  
- Score per climber:  
  - VP track + VP tokens collected  
  - +2 VP per token if climber holds both Traverse Tokens  
- Dead climber: scores 1 VP; loses all tokens and traverse tokens  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player whose climber first reached Peak 1 wins.

**Lhotse: South Col (Experienced Variant)**  
- Game ends after 15 rounds.  
- Score: climbers’ VPs + 1 VP per 2 acclimatization points from cards discarded during setup.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Tied for Risk Token**: No token taken.  
- **Cannot Pay Risk Penalty**: Must still apply if climber moved or received acclimatization. If impossible (e.g., no card used), no penalty.  
- **Multiple Events**: Resolve in order: base acclimatization → weather → landslide/avalanche.  
- **Space Capacity**: Cannot end turn in overfull space; can pass through.  
- **Fixed Ropes**: Do not count as printed connections for movement during avalanches/landslides.  
- **Snow Caves**: Can be occupied when flipped; flipped at end of turn.  
- **Solo Play**: Not detailed here; differs in risk token and death rules.
