# Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players control a squad of Blood Angels Space Marines entering a hostile Space Hulk infested with Genestealers. The objective is to survive long enough to reach the final Location card and fulfill one of two victory conditions:  
- Eliminate all Genestealers from both the formation and both Blip piles.  
- Fulfill the specific winning condition listed on the final Location card.  
If all Space Marines are slain before victory, all players lose. Victory is immediate upon meeting either condition.

2. Components  
- 128 cards:  
  - 30 Event Cards (red Marine back)  
  - 18 Action Cards (6 teams × 3 cards)  
  - 36 Genestealer Cards (rangefinder back)  
  - 12 Space Marine Cards (double-sided)  
  - 22 Location Cards (green with hazard edges)  
  - 8 Terrain Cards (double-sided: Door, Corridor, Control Panel, etc.)  
  - 2 Brood Lord Cards (blue with 3D cube)  
- 12 Support Tokens  
- 6 Combat Team Markers  
- 1 Combat Die (six-sided, with skulls on 1–3)  

3. Setup  
a. Decks:  
- Shuffle Genestealer deck (excluding Brood Lords) and Event deck separately.  
- Create Location Deck: Based on player count, assemble random Location Cards as directed on the starting "Void Lock" card (e.g., Solo: random 2, 3, 4 with 4 on bottom).  

b. Starting Location:  
- Place correct "Void Lock" card (by player count) in center.  
- Set up Terrain cards per Void Lock’s left/right icons and numbered positions (count from top with ↓, bottom with ↑).  

c. Formation:  
- Collect all Space Marine cards matching chosen teams, shuffle, and deal vertically below Void Lock.  
- Top half face left (arrow ←), bottom half face right (arrow →). Each row is a Position.  

d. Blip Piles:  
- Place face-down Genestealer cards into left and right Blip piles per Void Lock’s radar numbers.  

e. Event Spawn:  
- Draw top Event card. Spawn Genestealers on matching Terrain types (per colored bar) using Void Lock’s triangle numbers (yellow = major, white = minor). Draw from corresponding-side Blip pile. Discard card after.  

f. Support Tokens:  
- Place in shared supply.  

g. Combat Teams:  
- Each player chooses 1–3 Combat Team Markers (based on player count). Return unused teams to box.  
- Players receive matching Action Cards.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds through four phases:  
1. Choose Actions  
2. Resolve Actions  
3. Genestealer Attack  
4. Event  

After each phase, check for TRAVEL (if any Blip pile is empty). If triggered, interrupt and resolve TRAVEL before continuing.

5. Core Mechanics  

a. Choose Actions Phase  
- Each player secretly selects one Action card from their hand.  
- Cannot repeat the same Action type (Support, Move+Activate, Attack) two turns in a row.  
- Selected cards remain visible until end of next round’s Choose Actions Phase.  
- Players may discuss but not show cards.  

b. Resolve Actions Phase  
- Reveal all Action cards. Resolve in ascending numerical order (lowest number first).  
- The player with the lowest-numbered card becomes the Current Player.  

Types:  
- Support: Gain 1 Support Token, place on any Marine.  
- Move + Activate: Perform in order:  
  i. Swap any team Marine with adjacent Marine (facing unchanged).  
  ii. Change facing of any team Marine (flip card).  
  iii. Activate one Terrain card facing a team Marine.  
  - Terrain may only be activated once per round.  
- Attack: Each team Marine may attack one swarm within range and facing.  
  - Roll combat die: Skull (1–3) = hit (kill one Genestealer); 0,4,5 = miss.  
  - Support Tokens: Spend 1 per re-roll when attacking.  

c. Genestealer Attack Phase  
- Each swarm attacks its engaged Marine (same Position, left or right).  
- Resolve from top of formation downward; left swarm first if tied.  
- Owner rolls combat die:  
  - Roll > swarm size = miss  
  - Roll ≤ swarm size = Marine is slain  
- Support Tokens: Spend 1 per re-roll when defending, but only if Marine is facing the swarm. Cannot reroll if attacked from behind.  
- If Marine is slain: Immediately SHIFT formation (see below).  
- After all attacks, check Blip piles for TRAVEL.  

d. Event Phase  
- Current Player draws top Event card and resolves:  

i. Event Special Ability:  
- Follow text below artwork.  
- If "Instinct": choose and resolve secretly, then reveal.  
- Must choose valid target if possible.  

ii. Genestealer Activations (left to right):  
- Spawn:  
  - Triangle color (yellow/white) = number to spawn (from Void Lock reference).  
  - Bar color (red/orange/yellow/green) = Terrain type that spawns.  
  - Spawn on each matching Terrain card, drawing from local Blip pile.  
  - If insufficient cards, spawn as many as possible.  
- Move:  
  - Movement Icon (chevrons or curved arrow) + Genestealer Type icon.  
  - All swarms containing that Genestealer type move:  
    - ↑↓ chevrons: Left-side swarms move down, right-side move up.  
    - Off-end? Flank (move behind Marine).  
    - Curved arrow: All matching swarms flank.  
  - Each swarm moves only once per phase.  
- After activations, check Blip piles for TRAVEL.  
- Merge swarms in same Position/side at end of phase.  

e. SHIFT (When a Marine is Slain)  
- Remove slain Marine.  
- Shift smaller segment of formation (top or bottom) to fill gap.  
- If equal size, shift bottom segment up.  
- All Terrain, Genestealers, and Marines in the segment move with it.  
- Possible for multiple Terrain cards to occupy same Position.  

f. TRAVEL (When a Blip Pile is Empty)  
Triggered at end of any phase if any Blip pile is empty.  
1. Place New Location Card:  
   - Draw top Location card, place over current (keep Void Lock spawn numbers visible).  
2. Place Terrain Cards:  
   - Discard all current Terrain cards.  
   - Place new ones per new Location card’s left/right icons and positions (↑ from bottom, ↓ from top).  
3. Discard/Refill Blip Piles:  
   - Discard all remaining Blip cards.  
   - Restock each pile per new Location card’s radar numbers, from Genestealer deck (shuffle discard if needed).  
4. Follow Location Ability:  
   - If "Upon Entering", resolve now.  
   - If "Activate Control Panel", resolve each time a Control Panel is activated in this Location.  
- Continue with interrupted phase.  

g. Brood Lords  
- Not in decks or Blip piles. Spawn only when specified by Location card.  
- Must be last Genestealer killed in a swarm.  
- When swarm attacks, subtract 1 from die roll.  
- Has two movement icons: swarm moves if either matches Event card.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends immediately when:  
  a. Final Location card is reached AND all Genestealers are eliminated from formation and both Blip piles.  
  b. Final Location card is reached AND its specific winning condition is fulfilled.  
- In both cases, all players win.  
- If all Marines are slain before victory, all players lose.  
- Tiebreaker: If last Marine is slain at same time victory is achieved, players win.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a Marine change facing if not moved?** Yes, during Move+Activate, any team Marine may change facing, regardless of movement.  
- **Can Support Tokens prevent rear attacks?** No. Cannot spend Support Tokens when attacked from behind.  
- **Do swarms merge during Genestealer Attack Phase?** No. Swarms that move onto already-attacked swarms remain separate until end of Event Phase.  
- **What if no Event card can be drawn?** Shuffle discard pile to form new Event deck.  
- **Can a Terrain card be activated twice?** No. Only once per round.  
- **Do Brood Lords count toward swarm size for attack rolls?** Yes.  
- **What if a Marine is moved non-adjacently (via ability)?** No SHIFT occurs; simply swap positions.  
- **Can you win mid-phase?** Yes. Victory is checked after each action; game ends immediately upon meeting win condition.
