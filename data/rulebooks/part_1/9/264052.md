6. Place 6 Location Boards with correct sides up.  
7. Shuffle Farm Tiles into 3 stacks; place one face-up on Laboratory. Shuffle Ship Tiles into 3 stacks; place one face-up on Foundry.  
8. Each player chooses a color and takes:

   - 3 Dice (10 in reserve)  
   - 15 Water, 4 Algae, 2 Energy  
   - 1 Harvester (placed in Planet center)  
9. Randomly determine starting player; give them Radio.  
10. Shuffle Leader Cards; deal 3 to each player, choose 1 to keep.  
11. Draft Contract Cards: Draw 4, keep 1, pass 3 left; repeat; final 2: keep 1, discard 1.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
**Round Structure (7 rounds total):**  
1. **Plan Phase:**  
   - Reveal top Event Card; read aloud.  
   - Roll all available dice behind screens.  
   - Assign dice to Garages (left to right) or Farms (any order).  

2. **Execute Phase:**  
   - Remove screens.  
   - Resolve HQ dice left to right:  
     - Cannot return to HQ.  
     - First die may be flipped.  
   - In turn order (starting with Radio holder), send dice from leftmost Garage:  
     - First Garage: no Algae cost; die value may be ±1 (6↔1 not allowed).  
     - Other Garages: pay Algae cost or send all remaining dice to Cantina (+2 Water per die).  
     - If sending to Laboratory: use two equal-value dice simultaneously.  

3. **Harvest Phase:**  
   - All players simultaneously:  
     - Take resources from Harvester’s space on Planet Board (not if on revealed Gem Cache).  
     - Take resources from Farms:  
       - Leftmost Farm boosts other Farm dice by +3 (max 6).  
       - Output based on die value and Farm type (see Research Base table).  

4. **Rest Phase:**  
   - Return dice from Location Boards, Farms, Cantina to supply.  
   - Pass Radio clockwise.  
   - Check limits: max 5 dice (including HQ), max 8 Contract Cards. Discard excess.  
   - Begin next round unless Round 7 just ended.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Garages:** Used to send dice to locations. Fill left to right. First Garage allows ±1 die value. Other Garages have Algae cost. Upgradable with Ship Tiles.  
- **Farms:** Produce resources during Harvest. Leftmost Farm boosts others by +3 (max 6). Dice assigned during Plan Phase.  
- **Cantina:** If Algae cost unpaid, all remaining Garage dice go here; gain +2 Water per die.  
- **Headquarters (HQ):** Send dice here to act first next round. Gain 2 Contract Cards or 5 Water. Dice resolved left to right; first may be flipped.  
- **Locations:**  
  - **Mining Camp:** Pay Water = (X - Die Value) to gain Gems.  
  - **Laboratory:** Send two equal-value dice; pay 3 Algae or 10 Water; take any top Farm Tile; place on leftmost Foundation.  
  - **Foundry:** Pay 2 Energy or 10 Water; take Ship Tile based on die value (1/2: left, 3/4: middle, 5/6: right); place on leftmost empty Garage.  
  - **Market:** Die value = max number of trades; space determines trade ratios.  
  - **Academy:** Die must match space value; pay cost to gain 1 or 2 dice (placed under Research Base).  
  - **Control Room:** Pay 2 Energy or 10 Water; move Harvester per die direction; collect Water/Gem on space.  
  - **Negotiations Board:** Pay resource cost; die remains for game; may trigger Advancement (first of value) or Setback (sum ≥ threshold or duplicate value).  
  - **Depository:** Die value must match column; fulfill one Contract (pay cost); gain Delivery Reward (Harvester move, die, or 2 Contract Cards).  

- **Advancements & Setbacks (Negotiations Board):**  
  - **Advancement (first die of value):** Move matching Incident Token to right; choose reward:  
    - Harvest current Harvester resources  
    - Free Ship Tile  
    - Free Farm Tile  
    - Harvester move  
    - Gain 1 Gem  
    - Gain 1 die  
  - **Setback (sum ≥ threshold or duplicate):** Move matching Incident Token to right; choose punishment:  
    - Discard 2 Contract Cards  
    - Destroy a Ship Tile  
    - Return 1 die to supply  
    - Destroy a Farm Tile  
    - Move Harvester backward  
    - Pay 1 Gem  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game ends after Rest Phase of Round 7.**  
**Scoring:**  
- **Negotiations Board:** Sum of printed VP values next to each die.  
- **Fulfilled Contracts:** Contract value + end-game bonuses.  
- **Harvester:** VP if on a Gem Cache (revealed side).  
- **Research Base:**  
  - VP from Ship and Farm Tiles.  
  - VP from leftmost empty Garage and Farm/Foundation.  
  - Bonus: 8 VP if all 4 Garages upgraded; 7 VP if all 3 Farms built.  
- **Gems:** 1 VP each.  

**Tiebreaker:**  
1. Most dice in supply (including HQ).  
2. Most Energy, Algae, and Water.  
3. Shared victory.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Dice Limits:** Max 5 dice during Rest Phase (including HQ). Excess returned.  
- **Contract Drafting:** Final card from last two: keep one, discard one to bottom of deck.  
- **HQ Dice:** Count toward dice limit; not returned during Rest Phase.  
- **Laboratory:** In 4-player games, two pairs per round; otherwise one.  
- **Setbacks:** Must resolve one if possible; if none apply, choose any.  
- **Farm Boost:** Leftmost Farm die value irrelevant; always boosts others by +3 (max 6).  
- **Irenic Union Variant:** Players may send Garage dice in any order.  
- **Dyad Alliance Variant:** Players use two Leaders; game lasts 6 rounds; reduced starting resources.
