## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Between Two Cities is a city-building game where players collaboratively construct cities with their neighbors. Each player co-builds two cities—one to their left and one to their right. The objective is to maximize the score of your lower-scoring city. Your final score is the value of this lower city; the player with the highest such score wins.

2. Components  
- Square building tiles (purple, single buildings): Shops, Offices, Factories, Taverns, Parks, Houses (and Civic tiles in expansion)  
- Duplex tiles (yellow, double buildings): Rectangular tiles each showing two building types  
- City tokens: Mark ownership and placement order  
- Scoreboard with score track  
- Landscape mats (optional, for expansion): Provide starting spaces and compass orientation  
- District tiles and cards (expansion)  
- Reference cards for scoring and building types  

3. Setup  
- Place one city token between each pair of players to represent shared cities.  
- Shuffle and place the yellow duplex tiles into a face-down deck near the scoreboard.  
- Place the box with all square building tiles (purple) in the center and shuffle them face down inside.  
- (Capitals expansion): Use 5×5 landscape mats; place one between each player pair with compass arrow pointing inward. Place a random district tile face up in the center with two random district cards above it (replace if House+Factory combo with the 7th card).  
- Each player selects a pair of city tokens to track their scoring cities and takes a reference card.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game is played over three rounds. All actions are simultaneous.

**Round 1 (Clockwise Drafting)**  
- Each player draws 7 square tiles (9 in Capitals).  
- Choose 2 tiles to keep, place the remaining 5 face down next to the city to their left, with that city’s token on the stack.  
- When all players have chosen, reveal kept tiles.  
- With both neighbors, discuss and place one kept tile in the city to the left, the other in the city to the right.  
- Tiles must be placed adjacent to existing tiles (first tile on landscape mat if used), oriented consistently (ID in upper-left), and within a 4×4 (or 5×5) grid.  
- Repeat: Take the stack of passed tiles from the right, draw 7 (or 9), and repeat until only one tile remains. Discard it face down to the scoreboard.

**Round 2 (Duplex Tiles)**  
- Each player draws 3 duplex tiles.  
- Choose 2 to keep, discard the third face down to the scoreboard.  
- Reveal kept tiles.  
- With neighbors, place one tile in the left city, one in the right city, following placement rules.  
- No drafting loop—only one round of tile selection.

**Round 3 (Counterclockwise Drafting)**  
- Each player draws 7 square tiles (9 in Capitals).  
- Choose 2 to keep, place the remaining 5 face down next to the city to their right, with that city’s token on the stack.  
- Reveal kept tiles.  
- Place one tile in each city with neighbors.  
- Repeat: Take the stack from the left, draw 7 (or 9), and repeat until one tile remains. Discard it.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Drafting**: Simultaneous selection and passing of tiles in Rounds 1 and 3, clockwise in Round 1, counterclockwise in Round 3.  
- **Tile Placement**: All tiles must be orthogonally adjacent to an existing tile; cities must fit within 4×4 (or 5×5) bounds; all tiles in a city must be oriented the same way.  
- **Collaborative Building**: Each city is built by two players; placement decisions are made through open discussion.  
- **Scoring Constraints**: Each tile scores in only one category.

6. Scoring & End Game  
After Round 3:  
- Clear discards from the scoreboard.  
- Score one building type at a time, following the order on the reference card.

**Scoring Rules**  
- **Shops**: Score in straight, contiguous, orthogonal lines (horizontal or vertical). 1 shop = 2 pts, 2 = 5, 3 = 10, 4 = 16. Crossed lines: tile may count in only one line.  
- **Factories**: Score based on city rank:  
  - Most factories: 4 pts each  
  - Second-most: 3 pts each  
  - All others: 2 pts each  
- **Taverns**: Score by number of different types present (beer, food, music, accommodation). Duplicates allowed.  
  - 1 type: 1 pt, 2 types: 4 pts, 3 types: 9 pts, 4 types: 17 pts  
  - Each set scored separately if multiple groups.  
- **Offices**: Score per office: 1|3|6|10|15|21 for 1–6 offices. Additional offices start a new set.  
  - +1 pt per office adjacent to any tavern (only once, even if adjacent to multiple taverns).  
- **Parks**: Score per contiguous group (orthogonal only):  
  - 1 park: 2 pts, 2 parks: 8 pts, 3 parks: 12 pts, each additional park: +1 pt (4→13, 5→14, etc.)  
  - Multiple groups allowed; each scored separately.  
- **Houses**: Score per house:  
  - 1 pt if adjacent to any factory  
  - Otherwise, number of non-House building types present (max 5: Shops, Offices, Factories, Taverns, Parks)  
  - (Capitals): Civic tiles modify scoring; House scores based on non-Civic types.  
- **Districts (Capitals expansion)**:  
  - For each district, measure largest contiguous group of its two building types.  
  - 1st place: full points, 2nd place: second-place points.  
  - Tie for 1st: combine and split 1st+2nd points (round down); others get 0.  
  - Tie for 2nd: share 2nd-place points (round down).

Final Score: Each player’s score is the lower of their two cities’ totals.

**Tiebreakers**:  
1. Higher of the player’s two city scores  
2. Total count of each building type (in order: Shops, Factories, Taverns, Offices, Parks, Houses), first player with more wins

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can a shop be part of both a horizontal and vertical line?  
  A: No. Choose one line for scoring.  
- Q: Do offices get +1 for each adjacent tavern, or just once?  
  A: Only +1 total, even if adjacent to multiple taverns.  
- Q: Can parks form L-shapes or diagonals?  
  A: Adjacency is orthogonal only. Diagonals don’t count.  
- Q: Can a city have multiple scoring groups for parks or taverns?  
  A: Yes. Parks: multiple separate groups. Taverns: multiple sets if separated.  
- Q: What if two players tie for lowest-scoring city?  
  A: The one whose lower city is higher wins. Use tiebreakers if needed.
