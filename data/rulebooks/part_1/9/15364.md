### 3. Setup

   - For 3 players: remove 3 tiles from each of these stacks.

   - Matching markers (Population, Revenue, Fame, Bid)
   - Hotel-Casino sheet
3. Place markers:
   - Population on '8' of personal track
   - Revenue on '5' of personal track
   - Fame on '0' of main board score track
4. Prepare Premier Tile stacks:
   - Sort by size and A/B back
   - Shuffle each A and B stack separately
   - Stack A on top of B for each size → 3 face-down stacks (small, medium, large)
5. Flip top tile from each Premier stack and place on board’s Premier spaces (skip "4–5 players only" space in 3-player games).
6. For each Premier Tile:
   - Place red Minimum Bid marker on bid track at value shown on tile
7. Shuffle Event deck and place face-down.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows 6 phases:

1. **Drop Prices**  
   - Skip on first round.  
   - Dealer (player with Turn Order Button) moves each red Minimum Bid marker down one space on its bid track.  
   - If marker is on $3 and must move down: remove that Premier Tile and its marker from the game.

2. **Flip New Tiles**  
   - For each empty Premier space:
     - Dealer draws an Event Card.
     - Resolve Event Card text (e.g., restrict bidding, trigger effects).
     - Place No-Bid marker(s) if required.
     - Use symbol below card title to determine tile size (small/medium/large).
     - Draw top tile from indicated Premier stack and place on empty space.
     - Set red Minimum Bid marker at starting price on tile.
   - If a required Premier stack is empty when drawing: **game ends immediately**.
   - In 4–5 player games: refill the "4–5 players only" space if vacant.

3. **Collect Income**  
   - Each player receives income from Bank equal to the **lesser** of their current Population or Revenue.
   - Money is public.

4. **Choose Actions**  
   - Starting with Dealer, proceed clockwise.
   - Each player chooses one of three actions:
     - **Bid on Tile**
     - **Renovate**
     - **Publicity**
   - Players place Bid marker to declare action.
   - If a player is **outbid** during bidding, they may choose a new action when turn returns.
   - Phase ends when all players have a settled action (no outbidding in progress).

5. **Adjust Fame, Revenue, and Population**  
   - Resolve effects of chosen actions:
     - **Bid on Tile**: Winner pays bid amount, gains tile, may place one tile (including newly won).
     - **Renovate**: Remove 0–2 tiles, then place 0–2 tiles (from reserve).
     - **Publicity**: Gain 1 Fame, may place one tile.
   - Adjust stats (Fame, Revenue, Population) based on placed/removed tiles.
   - Retrieve all Bid markers.
   - **If any player fills their Hotel-Casino sheet**: game ends after this phase.

6. **Pass the Turn Order Button**  
   - Dealer passes button clockwise.
   - Remove all No-Bid markers from board.
