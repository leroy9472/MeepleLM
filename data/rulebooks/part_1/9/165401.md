3. Setup

- Place 1 Socialist marker in the holding box.  
- Place yellow factories in Hamburg and Dortmund; red factories in Berlin and Bitterfeld.  
- Set track markers (Prestige, WC, Socialist) to starting positions.  
- Set End of Decade marker to "Flight" side.  
- Set Flight track to 0.  
- Shuffle each decade’s card deck separately.  
- Each player draws 2 cards.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Game consists of 4 decades. Each decade has:  
  1. First Half-Decade  
  2. Second Half-Decade  
  3. End of Decade Phase  
- After 4 decades, game ends unless a sudden victory condition is met.

First Half-Decade:  
1. Place the decade’s special card in the display.  
2. Players may discard cards from previous decades, then draw to have 2 cards.  
3. Reveal 7 normal cards in the display.  
4. Players take turns choosing a card (from hand or display) to perform an action.  
   - East may choose the special card, but must either discard a hand card or allow West to draw one.  
   - Player with Prestige Advantage starts.  
5. Phase ends when the last normal card in the display is used.

Second Half-Decade:  
1. Reveal 7 new normal cards (no special card).  
2. Players take turns performing actions.  
   - Player who did not perform the last action in the first half starts.  
3. Phase ends when the last normal card is used.

End of Decade Phase:  
Execute 10 sequential steps:  
1. Flight from the Republic / The Wall  
2. Prestige  
3. Western Currency  
4. Pay for Police Power Cards  
5. Hold Living Standard  
6. Internal Comparison  
7. East-West Comparison  
8. Use Police Power Cards  
9. Socialists (Socialism Triumphs/Fails)  
10. Wir Sind Das Volk? (Collapse Check)  
- After phase, discard all cards and proceed to next decade.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Actions: On a turn, a player uses one card to:  
  a) Remove 1 Unrest (free if own-color card; otherwise costs 1 Dismantling Point)  
  b) Build Economy: Use card value as Build Points to place factories (1 BP) or infrastructure (1 BP, must connect to existing factory)  
  c) Increase Living Standard: Place up to 3 LS in different provinces. Requirement: Province economy ≥ 3 per LS (card value may temporarily boost economy by up to 2 per province). Each placed LS removes 1 Unrest.  
  d) Trigger Event: Use own-color or dual card. Execute all icons. Dual cards allow ignoring one arrow or one non-arrow icon.  
     - Icon with coat of arms: owner chooses location.  
     - Non-executable arrow: apply default effect (e.g., East removes Unrest for red arrow).  
     - Non-executable icon: ignore, unless it requires dismantling beyond capacity (then cannot trigger).  
     - Police Power icons ( and ): East collects the card when executed.

- Mass Protests:  
  - Occur when a province has 4 or more Unrest markers.  
  - Prevent building in that province.  
  - In East: replace 1 Unrest with a Socialist marker (if available) to remove Mass Protest.  
  - West Berlin: Mass Protest counts double; East places a second marker in a supplier province.

- Economy:  
  - Factory value = 1 + number of working connections (fully built infrastructure between two factories).  
  - Rundown factory (East only): base value 0, cannot be dismantled.  
  - Export Factory: highest-value factory in a province.  
  - Province economy = sum of factory values.

- Special Locations:  
  - Hamburg: West chooses whether it belongs to Niedersachsen or Schleswig-Holstein each action/end phase.  
  - Rheinsberg: Special factory (value 2) placed only by event. Cannot connect to infrastructure. Can be rundown or removed (1 DP each).  
  - External Factories (CSSR, Polska): Placed/removed by events. Add value to one connected province’s economy per action/end phase.  
  - East Berlin: Normal province; markers placed on small map.  
  - West Berlin: No factories or infrastructure. LS placed via suppliers. Sectors must be filled evenly. LS may be transferred from supplier if supplier has more LS than West Berlin (max 1 per action).

- Police Power:  
  - East collects and cards during events.  
  - Each card can be used once per decade (during action or End of Decade) to remove 1 Unrest.  
  - After use, unrest on card is returned to East; card is kept for next decade.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends under any of the following conditions:  
  a) Sudden Death (during End of Decade):  
     - East must dismantle but cannot → West wins.  
     - East needs new Socialist but none available → East wins.  
     - East must remove Socialist but none on board → West wins.  
  b) Collapse: A player has 4 or more Mass Protest markers → that player loses. If both have 4+, East wins.  
  c) End of Game: After 4 decades with no collapse → East wins.

- End of Decade Phase determines outcomes via:  
  - Flight from the Republic: Based on played icons, LS distribution, Police Power, Mass Protests. Result = East dismantling points.  
  - Western Currency: East needs 1 WC per LS. WC = track income + 1 per East Export Factory ≥ worst West Export Factory. Shortfall → convert factories to rundown (then dismantle infrastructure).  
  - East-West Comparison: Each province attacks one adjacent opponent province. Unrest = LS difference. 1 Mass Protest disables 1 attacking LS.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can East dismantle a rundown factory?  
  A: No. Rundown factories cannot be dismantled.  

- Q: Can West build in a province with Mass Protest?  
  A: No. Building is prohibited in any province with Mass Protest.  

- Q: How is factory value calculated?  
  A: 1 + number of fully built connections to other factories. Rundown factories count connections but start at 0.  

- Q: Who wins if both players collapse simultaneously?  
  A: East wins.  

- Q: Can Hamburg’s province assignment change during a single action?  
  A: No. Assignment is fixed for the duration of the action or End of Decade phase.  

- Q: What happens to unrest on Police Power cards when used?  
  A: Unrest is returned to East provinces (max 1 per province; East chooses).  

- Q: Can dual cards be used to trigger opponent’s events?  
  A: No. Only own-color or dual cards can be triggered, but only own or dual events may be executed.  

- Q: Is the special card available in the second half-decade?  
  A: No. Only normal cards are replenished; special card is not replaced.
