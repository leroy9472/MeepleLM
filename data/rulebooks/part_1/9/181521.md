4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of four phases:
1. Hero Phase
2. Enemy Phase
3. Location Phase
4. Peril Phase

5. Core Mechanics
1. Hero Phase
   - Heroes activate clockwise starting with the party leader.
   - Each hero performs one action by exhausting a readied action card.
   - Actions: Attack, Explore, Rest, Aid.
   - Before rolling, may spend success tokens from the chosen action (max 2 per card).
   - Roll:
     - White dice: one per die icon on the action card.
     - Black dice: one per readied enemy in the hero’s engagement zone.
   - Reroll: Each critical success (★) grants +1 success and is rerolled (can chain).
   - Apply modifiers (gear, conditions, etc.).
   - Resolve results in order:
     - Successes (✦): Apply to action (e.g., 1 progress per ✦ for Explore).
     - Attacks (♠): One enemy per ♠ attacks. Total damage = sum of attack values minus defense (♥) icons. Highest-attack enemies attack first.
     - Nemesis (■): Resolve all nemesis effects once per action (from nemesis lair, shadow zone, or engagement zones).
   - After action: if the card has a Prepare (↻) icon, ready all four action cards.

2. Enemy Phase
   - Heroes activate one readied enemy each, clockwise from party leader.
   - Choose enemy from own engagement zone, then shadow zone (faceup or facedown), or skip.
   - When activating:
     - Facedown enemies are flipped faceup before resolving.
     - Resolve keywords left to right: Advance, Retreat, Inflict, or special abilities.
   - Exhaust the enemy after activation.
   - After all enemies are exhausted, ready all enemy cards.

3. Location Phase
   - Resolve any "start of location phase" effects.
   - If progress tokens equal or exceed the location’s exploration value, the party may travel:
     - Discard the location card.
     - Discard non-nemesis enemies in the shadow zone.
     - Reveal a new location and spawn enemies as in setup.
   - Resolve any "end of location phase" effects.

4. Peril Phase
   - Move the peril token one space right.
   - Resolve peril effect matching the color of the new space.
   - Pass the party leader token to the next hero clockwise.

6. Scoring & End Game
- The quest ends when victory or defeat conditions on the quest sheet are met.
- Victory: Resolve the Reward section.
- Defeat: Resolve the Penalty section.
- In a campaign, proceed to the next quest regardless of outcome unless it was the final quest (which wins the campaign).
