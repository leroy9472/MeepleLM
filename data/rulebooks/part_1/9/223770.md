### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Anti-Monopoly Chip Rules  
- The player with the **most shares** in a company controls the **Anti-Monopoly chip** for that company.  
- In case of a tie, the player who reached that share count **first** retains the chip until overtaken.

**Benefits of holding the Anti-Monopoly chip**:
- You **cannot be targeted** — no player may take shares of this company from the market.  
- When **you draw from the deck**, you **do not place Capital chips** on shares of this company in the market.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End Trigger  
- The game ends **immediately after the player who draws the last card from the deck completes their turn**.  
- All players then **add remaining hand cards to their portfolios**.

#### Profit Distribution  
For **each company** represented in players’ portfolios:

1. Determine the player with the **most shares** (majority stakeholder).  
   - If **tied**, **no one receives payment** for that company.  
2. Each **other player** who holds shares in that company must pay:  
   - **1 Capital chip per share they own**, placed **3-side up** (i.e., 3-point value).  
   - Payments go to the majority stakeholder.  

**Payment Rules**:  
- Players **do not pay** using any **3-point chips** they just received.  
- If a player **cannot fully pay**, use **+ and − point markers** to track **debt or credit**.  

#### Final Scoring  
- Total the **value of all Capital chips** (1s and 3s).  
- **Highest total wins**.

#### Tiebreakers (in order):  
1. Most **3-point chips**.  
2. Player who **played last** (i.e., closest to end of final turn order).
