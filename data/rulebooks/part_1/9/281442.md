### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of 3 turns per player. Each turn has 4 phases:  

#### 1. Draft  
- If no die on Potency Track, draft any die from a bowl.  
- Potency = number of dice in bowl (including drafted die).  
- Infinity (∞) die: Immediately choose new symbol; potency based on ∞ bowl.  
- Optional: Spend 1 Ethereal Die to increase potency by 1 (max 5).  
- You may draft a new die even with one active (wasting remaining potency).  

#### 2. Action  
Spend potency from drafted die to perform **exactly one** of:  
- **Harvest Materials**: Spend 1+ potency → gain 1 raw material per potency (matching die symbol).  
- **Acquire Essences**: Spend 1+ potency → gain 1 essence per potency (type shown next to die’s symbol bowl). ∞ die allows choice of essence.  
- **Transmute Materials**: Spend 1+ potency → transmute 1 material per potency along arrow matching die color. Must use same arrow per action. Cost: 1 Essence per transmutation. Advance on corresponding Mastery Track. Activate Artifact if arrow passes over active one.  
- **Acquire Artifact**: Spend **exactly 3 potency** → take 1 Artifact from market matching die color. Place in any slot; gain immediate ability. Refill from current Artifact stack.  
- **Recharge Artifact**: Spend **exactly 1 potency** → flip 1 of your exhausted Artifacts face-up.  
- **Acquire Experiment**: Spend **exactly 1 potency** → take 1 Experiment from board matching die symbol. Max 2 incomplete Experiments (Masterpiece doesn’t count). Replenish only if from current level deck.  

**Free Actions (unlimited, before/after main action):**  
- **Purchase Formula**: Pay 1/2/3/4 Gold for 1st/2nd/3rd/4th Formula bought. Place in Vault. Max 1 per column.  
- **Sample Formula**: Flip face-up Formula in Vault to use its ability.  
- **Perform Experiment**: Pay material cost and meet Mastery requirement for Experiment next to board or Masterpiece. Discounts:  
  - Spend Silver (●) to reduce Mastery requirement by 1 per Silver.  
  - Each Formula in column reduces requirement by 1 (material or Mastery).  
  Gain bonuses; slide Experiment into column. First in column → gain 1 Formula.  

#### 3. Reactions  
After main action, each opponent may flip 1 Reaction token to perform **one** of:  
- Gain 1 raw material (matching active player’s die symbol).  
- Gain 1 essence (type shown next to active player’s die symbol bowl).  
- Transmute 1 material using arrow matching active player’s die color (pay 1 Essence).  
- Recharge 1 exhausted Artifact.  

#### 4. Lab Cleanup  
1. If die potency is 0, move to Used Dice box.  
2. If 3 dice in Used Dice box, move Turn Order marker to next New Round Order position.  
3. If any player is on or above a Bonus Token, remove it (bonus already claimed).  

### End of Round  
1. Flip all Artifacts and Reaction tokens face-up.  
2. If Round 3 → proceed to Final Scoring.  
3. Remove all face-up Artifacts from market.  
4. Replace Artifact stack with next level (Round 1→2: Level 2; Round 2→3: Level 3).  
5. Draw 6 new Artifacts to refill market.  
6. Remove all Level 1 Experiments from board (Round 2 end only).  
7. Replace Experiment deck with next level.  
8. Add 1 new Experiment from current deck to each space.  
9. Move Turn Order markers from New Round Order to Current Round Order.  
10. Reroll all dice into bowls (re-roll >5 per bowl).  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Gold (●)**: Wild material; can substitute any material or essence. Can pay Mastery/material costs.  
- **Silver (●)**: Pay to reduce Experiment Mastery requirement by 1 per Silver.  
- **Mercury (◆)**: Counts as both material and essence. Can be spent as either.  
- **Chameleon Token**: Discard before action to treat die as different symbol/color for that action only.  
- **Transmutation Rules**:  
  - Can transmute raw or refined materials.  
  - Must match die color to arrow color.  
  - Pay 1 Essence per transmutation.  
  - Advance on Mastery Track (1 VP if at max).  
  - Activate Artifact if arrow passes over active one (then flip it).  
- **Formula Unlocking**:  
  - First Experiment in column unlocks 1 Formula from that column.  
  - Can buy up to 1 Formula per column with Gold (cost: 1/2/3/4).  
  - Placing Formula in Vault: complete row/column → gain side/top/bottom bonuses.  
- **Mastery Tracks**:  
  - Advance via transmutations, bonuses, or card effects.  
  - Bonus Tokens at positions 4 and 8 grant:  
    - Advance 1 on any track  
    - Gain Chameleon Token  
    - Gain Ethereal Die  
    - Score 5 VP  
  - At max (12), gain 1 VP per advancement.  
  - Top 3 positions score VP: 2/4/7 at levels 10/11/12.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After Round 3:  
1. **Experiments**: Score VP in bottom-right corner of completed Experiments.  
2. **Publications**:  
   - Draw 2, keep 1 (discard to bottom).  
   - Complete using elemental symbols from:  
     - Artifacts (symbols printed)  
     - Completed Experiments (1 per)  
     - Mastery Track tops (1 per at level 12)  
   - Each symbol used only once per Publication.  
   - Score VP for completed Publications.  
3. **Philosopher’s Stone**:  
   - 1/4/9/16/25/36 VP for 1/2/3/4/5/6+ Formulas in Vault.  
4. **Materials & Tokens**: 1 VP per Gold and Ethereal Die remaining.  
5. **Mastery Tracks**: 2/4/7 VP for top 3 positions (levels 10/11/12).  
6. **Achievements (variant)**: Score VP for claimed cards.  

**Winner**: Most VP. Tiebreaker: most completed Experiments.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I perform Free Actions after Reactions?** No. Free Actions must be before or after main action, not after Reactions.  
- **Can I use Gold to pay for Essence in transmutation?** Yes. Gold can substitute Mercury.  
- **Can I transmute using different arrows in one action?** Only if granted wild transmutations (e.g., via Formula). Otherwise, same arrow.  
- **Can I unlock a second Formula from the same column?** Only via Gold purchase (max 1 per column). Performing more Experiments doesn’t unlock more.  
- **Do Bonus Tokens trigger for multiple players on same turn?** Yes. All who reach it (via action or reaction) gain benefit before token is removed.  
- **Can I use a Formula ability after flipping it during my turn?** Yes. Sample (flip) and use ability immediately.  
- **Can I react to my own action?** No. Only other players may react.
