# Belfort — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

In Belfort, players are Master Architects competing to build the most influential structures in the frontier city of Belfort. Due to a bureaucratic error, multiple architects are hired simultaneously, leading to fierce competition for resources, workers, and royal favor. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) over seven rounds by dominating districts, managing workers, and building properties and guilds. The winner is awarded the ceremonial Key to the City.

### 2. Components

  - 1 Player Aid Board

### 3. Setup

     - Beginner: 3 Resource, 2 Basic
     - Normal: 1 Resource, 2 Basic, 2 Interactive
     - Advanced: 5 random or agreed-upon
   - Place guild tiles on board in any district.
3. **Prepare Collection Board**:
   - Place resource piles (Wood, Stone, Metal, Gold) beside their respective areas.
4. **Calendar Board Setup**:
   - Place Gnomes: 9 (2p), 14 (3p), 18 (4p), 22 (5p) in "Gnomes for Hire".
   - Place Calendar Marker just left of first month of Spring.
   - Place property deck; draw 3 face-up cards as draw pool.
5. **Player Setup**:
   - Each player chooses a color and takes:
     - 1 Player Aid, 12 Property Markers, 1 Scoring Marker
     - 3 Elves, 3 Dwarves (Master side down); remaining workers go to supply
     - 1 Turn Order Crest (randomly assigned)
     - Starting resources: 1 Wood, 1 Stone, 1 Metal, 5 Gold
     - 5 Property Cards; choose 3 to keep, discard 2
   - Place scoring markers at start of score track.
6. **2-Player Variant**:
   - Include Wizards’ Guild.
   - Use two non-player (NP) colors; each NP has 12 Property Markers, 4 Elves, 4 Dwarves, and Turn Order Crests 3 and 4.
   - Each player controls one NP based on their crest.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

Each game lasts 7 rounds (months). Each round has 5 phases:

#### 1. Calendar
- Advance Calendar Marker to next month.
- If marker lands on an "X", proceed to Scoring after Actions phase.

#### 2. Placement
- Players take turns placing one worker or passing.
- Starting with Turn Order 1, players:
  - Place a worker on an unoccupied plank, or
  - Pass and distribute remaining workers to Resource Areas.
- Available planks:
  - **Recruiter’s Desk**: Pay 2 Gold; Elf recruits Elf, Dwarf recruits Dwarf.
  - **King’s Camp**: Place on lowest-numbered unoccupied plank (1 per player per round).
  - **Guilds**: Pay 1 Gold to owner (or supply if unowned).
  - **Property Cards**: Only on your built cards; some require Gnome unlock.
- Workers not placed go to Resource Areas (Forest, Quarry, Mine, Gold Mine).

#### 3. Collection
Resolve areas left to right:

- **Forest**: 1 Elf → 1 Wood. Majority (most Elves) → +1 Wood. Tie → no bonus.
- **Quarry**: 1 Dwarf → 1 Stone. Majority → +1 Stone. Tie → no bonus.
- **Mine**: 1 Elf + 1 Dwarf → 1 Metal. Majority (most total workers) → +1 Metal. Tie → no bonus.
- **Gold Mine**: 1 Worker → 1 Gold. Majority → +1 Gold. Tie → no bonus.
  - Master Workers count as 2 for collection, but 1 for majority.
- **Recruiter’s Desk**: Reclaim worker; gain 1 matching worker from supply.
- **King’s Camp**: In placement order, swap Turn Order Crests with another player. Crests flipped face down after use; all flipped back up after resolution.
- **Income & Taxes**:
  - Collect 1 Gold per Income symbol on built properties.
  - Pay taxes based on score track position. Unpaid Gold → -1 VP per missing Gold.

#### 4. Actions
In Turn Order (Crest 1 to N), each player performs actions in any order, any number of times unless restricted:

- **Build Property**: Pay cost; place card in front of you; place Property Marker on matching unclaimed symbol.
- **Build Wall**: Pay 3 Wood + 3 Stone; place marker on unclaimed Wall symbol.
- **Build Guild**: Pay cost on tile; place marker on Guild symbol; now you own it.
- **Activate Placed Workers**:
  - Reclaim and perform action from any worker placed in Placement phase.
  - Must activate all placed workers.
- **Visit Trading Post (1x/turn)**: Up to 1 Buy and 1 Sell, in any order.
- **Hire Gnome (1x/turn)**: Pay 3 Gold; take Gnome; place on unoccupied Gnome Lock to unlock ability.
- **Buy Property Card (last action)**: Pay 1 Gold; take from draw pool or deck. Replace if from pool.
  - End turn with ≤5 cards; discard excess.

#### 5. Scoring (only if Calendar Marker on X)
Occurs after 3rd, 5th, and 7th months.

- **District Majority** (per district):
  - 1st: 5 VP, 2nd: 3 VP, (4–5p) 3rd: 1 VP.
  - Tie: All tied players get next lower rank’s points; lower ranks bumped down.
- **Worker Majority** (per type: Elf, Dwarf, Gnome):
  - 1st: 3 VP, 2nd: 1 VP.
  - Master Elves/Dwarves count as 1 for scoring.
  - Gnomes on built properties only.
  - Tie rules same as above.

### 5. Core Mechanics

- **Worker Placement**: Core action engine. Workers on planks trigger effects in Actions phase.
- **Resource Collection**: Via Collection Board areas; majority bonuses add competition.
- **Turn Order Management**: King’s Camp allows swapping crests for future advantage.
- **Gnome Unlocking**: Hire Gnomes to unlock powerful abilities on properties.
- **Guild Ownership**: Earn income and charge fees; strategic control point.
- **Card Management**: Hand limit of 5; buy cards at end of turn.
- **Expansion & Variants**: Modular rules (Queen, Key, Expansion, etc.) add depth.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

- Game ends after **third scoring phase** (end of Round 7).
- Final VP = Score track + Scoring phase points.
- **Tiebreaker**:
  1. Most total resources (Wood, Stone, Metal, Gold).
  2. Metal counts as 2.
  3. If still tied, players share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Hand Limit**: Must discard down to 5 at end of turn, after buying card.
- **Gnome Hiring**: Only if unoccupied Gnome Lock exists. No limit per round beyond availability.
- **Guild Actions**: Can be used multiple times if multiple workers placed.
- **Master Workers**: Only count as 2 for resource collection, not for majority or scoring.
- **2-Player NP Turns**: After player turns, each player builds for their NP (free), then moves NP’s Dwarf clockwise.
- **Ties in Majority**: All tied players drop one rank; lower ranks also drop.
- **Taxes**: Must pay as much as possible. Unpaid → move back on score track (effectively -1 VP per Gold).
- **Architects’ Guild Build**: Discount of 1 Metal **or** 2 Wood/Stone. Can build any unclaimed property, wall, or guild.
