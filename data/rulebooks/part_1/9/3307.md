## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Wallenstein is a strategy board game set in the Holy Roman Empire during the Thirty Years' War. Players take on the roles of regional rulers vying for dominance through military control, economic development, and religious influence. The goal is to score the most victory points over two in-game years by controlling territories, constructing buildings, and achieving regional majorities in palaces, churches, and trading firms.

2. Components  
- Main game board divided into 5 colored regions (Brandenburg-red, Kurpfalz-yellow, Sachsen-blue, Osterreich-green, Bayern-purple)  
- 25 Event Cards  
- 25 Land Cards (plus 5 blank Land Cards per player)  
- Player Mats (1 per player) with action planning spaces  
- Wooden cubes: 62 per player in player colors (armies), 20 green cubes (farmers)  
- Gold coins: wood (1 gold), orange (5 gold)  
- Cube Tower (for resolving battles and revolts)  
- Leader Cards (in player colors)  
- Action Cards (numbered 1–10)  
- Grain Scale (on main board) with player markers  
- Revolt/Unrest markers  

3. Setup  
a) Board & Tower:  
- Place main board. Assemble cube tower.  
- For 3 players: exclude white-bordered lands (Bremen, Holstein, Luttich, Burgundy, Fm. Konstanz, Fm. Bavaria, Steiermark, Tirol) and remove corresponding land cards.  

b) Player Materials:  
- Each player takes:  
  - 62 armies in their color  
  - 5 blank land cards  
  - 1 player mat  
  - Gold: 18 (3 players), 15 (4 players), 13 (5 players)  
  - 1 grain marker (placed at 0 on grain scale)  

c) Tower Priming:  
- Throw 7 armies from each player + 10 farmers into the tower.  
- Return any cubes that fall through to their supplies.  

d) Initial Armies:  
- Organize armies into groups:  
  - 5 players: 7 groups (5,4,4,3,3,2,2)  
  - 4 players: 8 groups (5,4,4,3,3,2,2,2)  
  - 3 players: 9 groups (5,4,4,3,3,2,2,2,2)  

e) Country Assignment:  
- Shuffle land cards, deal 2 face-up.  
- Shuffle leader cards to determine player order.  
- In order, each player selects:  
  - One face-up card or the top face-down card  
  - Places one army group on the chosen land  
- Replace selected face-up cards immediately.  
- If no one selects face-up cards in a full round, set them aside and reveal two new ones.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game spans 2 years. Each year consists of:  
1. Year Start  
2. Spring (Action Phase)  
3. Summer (Action Phase)  
4. Autumn (Action Phase)  
5. Winter (Scoring Phase)  

Repeat for second year. Game ends after second Winter.

a) Year Start:  
- Reveal 4 Event Cards face-up at top of board.  
- Reset all grain markers to 0.  

b) Spring, Summer, Autumn (Action Phases):  
1. Shuffle 10 Action Cards: place 5 face-up (Aktion 1–5), 5 face-down (6–10).  
2. Players simultaneously place 1 land card (regular or blank) face-down on each of 10 action spaces on their player mat. May leave spaces empty only if fewer than 10 land cards.  
3. Shuffle leader cards and assign player order (Spieler 1 to 5).  
4. Randomly select one of the 4 face-up Event Cards and place it on "aktuelles Ereignis" (current event).  
5. Resolve Actions 1 to 10 in order:  
   - After each of Actions 1–5, flip the next face-down Action Card face-up.  
   - In player order, each player reveals their land card for the current action and resolves it.  
   - Blank card = no action.  
   - Must fully resolve action or forfeit it entirely.  
   - Conflicting actions resolve in player order; non-conflicting may be done simultaneously.  

c) Winter Phase:  
1. Grain Loss: Each player reduces grain by value on last remaining Event Card.  
2. Revolts: If a player has fewer grain units than owned lands:  
   - Short 1–2 grain → draw 1 non-blank land card at random → revolt in that land  
   - Short 3–6 grain → draw 2 cards → revolts in those lands  
   - Short 7+ grain → draw 3 cards → revolts in those lands  
3. Scoring:  
   a) Regional Majorities:  
      - In each of 5 regions:  
        - Most Palaces → 3 VP (tie: 2 VP each)  
        - Most Churches → 2 VP (tie: 1 VP each)  
        - Most Trading Firms → 1 VP (tie: 0 VP each)  
   b) Ownership Points:  
      - 1 VP per land owned  
      - 1 VP per building owned  
4. Remove all revolt/unrest markers.  

5. Core Mechanics  
a) Actions (by Action Card):  
- **Palace / Church / Trading Firm (3 actions):**  
  - Pay 3 / 2 / 1 gold to build in an empty city in the played land.  
  - Each city: max 1 building. Each land: max 1 of each building type.  

- **Grain or Gold (2 actions):**  
  - Gain grain (move marker) or gold as shown on land card and player mat.  
  - If land has ≥1 unrest marker → resolve revolt before gaining.  
  - After gain (or failed revolt), add 1 unrest marker.  

- **Recruit Armies (3 actions):**  
  - 3 Gold → 5 armies to land  
  - 2 Gold → 3 armies to land  
  - 1 Gold → 1 army to land **and/or** move armies from land to adjacent owned land (must leave ≥1 behind)  

- **Move and Battle (2 actions):**  
  - Move ≥1 army from land to adjacent land. Must leave ≥1 behind.  
  - If destination not owned → battle.  

b) Battle Resolution:  
1. Add to tower:  
   - All armies in tray (leftover)  
   - All attacking armies  
   - Defending armies: as many as defender chooses from land  
   - If free land: add 1 farmer  
   - If land has <2 unrest markers: add 1 farmer per unrest marker  
2. Dump tower. Collect:  
   - Attacking armies  
   - Defending player armies  
   - Defending farmer armies (only if <2 unrest markers)  
3. Compare totals:  
   - Attacker > Defender → attacker wins:  
     - Takes land card (from defender or supply)  
     - Defender’s remaining armies (if any) return to supply  
     - Add 1 unrest marker if conquering free land  
   - Attacker = Defender → land devastated:  
     - Return all buildings, unrest markers, armies, and land card to supply  
   - Defender > Attacker → no change  
4. Remove losing armies to supply.  
5. Remove equal number of winning armies to supply (farmers first).  
6. Remaining winning armies placed in land.  
7. Neutral farmers (not participating) remain in tray.  

c) Revolt Resolution:  
1. Add to tower:  
   - Armies in tray  
   - 1 farmer per unrest marker  
   - In winter revolts: additional farmers based on grain shortfall:  
     - 1 short → 1 farmer  
     - 2–4 short → 2 farmers  
     - 5+ short → 3 farmers  
   - Defender uses armies present in the land  
2. Dump tower. Count:  
   - Farmer armies (attackers)  
   - Defender’s armies  
3. Compare:  
   - Farmers ≥ Defenders → revolt succeeds:  
     - Land devastated (all returned to supply)  
   - Defenders > Farmers → revolt fails:  
     - Return all farmers and equal number of defender armies to supply  
     - Remaining defenders return to land  
4. No land change if revolt fails.  

d) Simultaneous Actions:  
- Players may resolve non-conflicting actions at the same time (e.g., building, recruiting) if resources allow.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Final scoring occurs at end of second Winter.  
- Total points from:  
  - 1 VP per land owned  
  - 1 VP per building owned  
  - Regional majorities (Palace 3, Church 2, Firm 1; reduced by 1 for ties)  
- Highest score wins.  
- Tiebreakers:  
  1. Most Palaces  
  2. Most Churches  
  3. Most Trading Firms  
  4. Shared victory if still tied  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Accidental cube drop:** If a cube falls out of tower during play, leave it in the tray until next combat.  
- **Player loses all lands:** Rules silent. Player continues; can reclaim land via conquest.  
- **Defender wins battle with no armies:** Rules silent. If only farmers defend and win, land remains under player control (no armies required to hold).  
- **Blank land cards:** Can be used in action planning. No effect when revealed.  
- **Event Cards:** 4 dealt at year start. One randomly selected per season (Spring–Autumn). Last card’s grain value used in Winter.
