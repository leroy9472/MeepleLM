## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   In CO₂: Second Chance, players are CEOs of energy companies responding to government requests for green power plants. The goal is to stop pollution growth while meeting energy demands and profiting. Victory is determined differently by mode:
   - *Cooperative/Solo*: Survive 4 decades, complete 2 private goals, claim all but 3 UN Goal cards, and complete your ongoing Solo Goal Card (if used).
   - *Competitive*: Survive 5 decades (CO₂ ≤ 500 ppm) and score the most victory points.

2. **Components**  
   - 1 double-sided gameboard (cooperative/competitive)
   - 4 player boards, 2-piece player aids
   - 36 Knowledge/Score/Action markers, 32 Infrastructure tokens, 20 Control markers, 32 Control cubes, 16 Scientists (all in player colors)
   - 50 Carbon Emission Permits (CEPs), 1 CEP Market Price marker
   - 1 Team Score marker, 30 Tech cubes
   - 1 Decade marker, 2 Global CO₂ Pollution Level markers
   - Currency: $1B, $2B, $5B, $10B
   - 25 Green Power Plants (5 per type), 25 Projects
   - 30 Fossil Fuel Power Plants
   - 8 Regional Agenda tiles, 18 Energy Summit tiles
   - 47 Environmental Goal tiles (cooperative), 7 Event tiles (competitive)
   - 36 Lobbyist cards
   - 45 UN Goal cards (2 types), 16 Cooperative Private Goal cards, 10 Company Private Goal cards
   - Optional expansion components: Global Event tile, 6 Project Randomizers, Arctic Region tile, 8 additional Lobbyist cards, Huge Coal Plant tile, plastic 3D components

3. **Setup**  
   - *Cooperative/Solo*: Use cooperative board side. Place CO₂ marker at 400 ppm. Set up Environmental Goal tiles (8 green, 5 pink, 8 blue). Each player gets 2 Cooperative Private Goal cards. Use UN Inspectors variant in solo.
   - *Competitive*: Use competitive board side. Place CO₂ marker at 50 ppm. Replace Environmental Goals with Event tiles. Each player draws 2 Company Private Goal cards, keeps one.
   - All modes: Shuffle and place Regional Agenda tiles. Place 1 CEP in each region’s CEP space. Set CEP market with 2 CEPs and price at $3. Shuffle and place Power Plants and Projects. Deal 5 Lobbyist cards per player.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   - *Cooperative/Solo (4 decades)*:  
     1. Operations  
     2. Income  
     3. Environmental Goals  
     4. Energy Supply  
     5. End of Decade  
   - *Competitive (5 decades)*:  
     1. Energy Supply  
     2. Operations  
     3. Income  
     4. Events  
     5. End of Decade  

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Operations Phase**:
     - Main Actions (1 per turn): Propose a Project, Prepare Infrastructure, Build a Power Plant.
     - Executive Actions (up to 1 each per turn): Move a Scientist, Visit CEP Market, Play a Lobbyist Card or Claim a UN Goal Card.
     - Scientists gain knowledge when moved from a project or after a completed Energy Summit.
     - In solo: May take a second Main Action by increasing CO₂ by 1 space (if < 500 ppm).
   - **Income Phase**: Players with top 2 markers (1st only in 2-player) on each Knowledge track gain income, split as money and/or VP.
   - **Environmental Goals (Cooperative)**: Unmet goals penalize VP: -1/decade (2010), -2 (2020), -3 (2030), -4 (2040). UN Inspectors double penalty if unmet.
   - **Energy Supply**: Each region without a green plant draws a fossil fuel plant, increasing CO₂. A CEP must be spent: by region (if uncontrolled) or player (if controlled), else pay fine (lose VP = CEP price).
   - **Events (Competitive)**: Discard 1 Tech cube from each region. Affected region requires uninvolved players to pay 1 Tech cube and 1 CEP (or fine). If CO₂ ≥ 400 ppm, second event triggers.
   - **End of Decade**: Advance decade, pass start player, check game end.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - *Cooperative/Solo Loss Conditions*:
     - CO₂ > 500 ppm at any time.
     - VP < 0 after Environmental Goals or Energy Supply phase.
     - Fail to complete 2 private goals or >3 UN Goal cards unclaimed after 4 decades.
   - *Competitive Loss Condition*: CO₂ > 500 ppm at any time.
   - *Final Scoring (Competitive)*:
     1. Collect CEPs from controlled regions.
     2. Sell all CEPs at current market price.
     3. Discard Company Goal card for $8 or reveal for VP.
     4. 1 VP per $2.
     5. 3 VP for most Tech cubes (tie: all get 3).
     6. UN Goal Cards: 1=6, 2=10, 3=15, 4+=21 VP.
   - *Winning*: Highest VP. Tiebreakers: most UN Goals, most power plants, most infrastructures, most money.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - *CEP Market Empty*: Increase price by 1, add 2 CEPs from bank. Market closes for remainder of turn.
   - *Cannot Pay CEP*: Take from market, lose VP = current price.
   - *Scientist Movement*: Can only move to Summit from a project. After Summit, returns to player board.
   - *Build Power Plant*: Can use region’s Tech cube to reduce cost. Replace oldest fossil plant if no space.
   - *Region Control*: Determined when building a plant: most energy types, most preferred types, most knowledge in built type, active player.
   - *Solo Opposition Cubes*: 8 neutral cubes placed to block region control; player always wins knowledge tie.
