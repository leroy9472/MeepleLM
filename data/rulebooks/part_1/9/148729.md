## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
You are a member of the French Resistance during World War II, fighting against the Nazi occupation. The goal is to complete two Missions within 15 Days. Success means victory for the Resistance. The game ends in a loss if:  
- The town's Morale reaches 0 ("FAIL" space),  
- The 15th Day ends without completing two Missions, or  
- Your last Resistance Worker is arrested.  
Completing both Missions immediately wins the game.

3. Setup  
1. Place the game board and tracking board.  
2. Shuffle the 10 Patrol cards into a face-down deck.  
3. Place tracking cubes on their starting positions (Day 1, Morale start, Soldier 0).  
4. Place all Resource tokens to the side to form the Supply.  
5. Place Spare Room Action tiles face-up near the board.  
6. Place 3 Resistance Workers in the Safe House; place the remaining 2 next to the Café (recruitable later).  
7. Randomly select two Mission cards and place them above the two exits at the top of the board. Return unused cards to the box.  
8. Place all other pawns and tokens near the board.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each Day consists of three phases:  
1. Placement Phase  
2. Action Phase  
3. Upkeep Phase  

Repeat until the game ends.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Placement Phase:  
  - Determine number of Patrols: compare available Resistance Workers to the red number on the current Morale space; use the higher number.  
  - Players and Patrols alternate placing one pawn at a time, starting with the player.  
  - Resistance Workers are placed from the Safe House to any unoccupied Location.  
  - For each Patrol: draw a Patrol card; place the Patrol pawn on the first unoccupied Location listed. If all three are occupied, attempt an arrest: arrest the first Resistance Worker on the list and place the Patrol there. If all three are occupied by Patrols, do not place the pawn. Discard the card face-up.  
  - If the Soldier track is ≥1, replace the last placed Patrols with Soldiers (one-for-one). Soldiers are always placed last.  

- Action Phase:  
  - Activate each Resistance Worker one at a time, in any order.  
  - A Worker may perform one action if on a Location with an available action.  
  - Resources earned during the Day may be used immediately for later actions.  
  - Actions include:  
    - Gathering Resources (e.g., Food, Intel)  
    - Trading Resources (left of arrow → right)  
    - Choosing between options (indicated by slash /)  
    - Airdrop: Spend an action to place 1 Weapon, 1 Money, or 3 Food on an empty Field Location  
    - Pickup Airdrop: Retrieve airdropped Resources (not on the same turn as delivery)  
    - Add Spare Room: Pay 2 Money to replace a Spare Room Location with a chosen Spare Room Action tile (permanent)  
    - Mission Actions: Perform actions on Mission card Locations to earn successes. Numbered successes (1, 2, etc.) must be completed in order.  
  - Using a Fake Id: During Placement, place a Fake Id token with a Worker. If the Worker is blocked returning, spend the Fake Id to bypass one Patrol (Milice or Soldier). If not blocked, the Fake Id is retained.  

- Check Escape Route:  
  - After all actions, each Worker must trace a clear path back to a Safe House along white roads.  
  - The path may pass through empty Locations or Locations with other Resistance Workers.  
  - The path may not pass through Locations with Milice or Soldiers.  
  - If a Worker cannot return, they are arrested and removed permanently.  
  - If the Location has an orange shield with a star, rewards are kept; otherwise, they are lost.  

- Shooting Milice:  
  - Once per Day, discard a Weapon to remove one Milice Patrol from the board.  
  - Increase the Soldier track by 1.  
  - Decrease Morale by 1.  
  - Can be used at any time during the Action Phase (e.g., after an action, before checking escape).  
  - Cannot remove Soldiers.  

- Upkeep Phase:  
  - Remove all Patrols from the board.  
  - Advance the Day tracker by 1.  
  - If the new Day space is orange, decrease Morale by 1.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Win: Complete two Missions.  
- Major Win: Achieve a Major Success on a three-star Mission and complete a second Mission.  
- Draw: Complete one Mission when the 15th Day ends.  
- Lose:  
  - Last Worker is arrested.  
  - Morale reaches 0.  
  - 15 Days pass with fewer than two Missions completed.  

Three-star Missions may have Major Success conditions (e.g., Bomb the Barracks requires two actions on the same day).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I look at the Patrol discard pile? Yes, all information is open except the face-down deck.  
- What if I run out of a Resource? The game has only 4 of each Resource. If the Supply is empty, you cannot gain that Resource.  
- Can I use a newly acquired Weapon to Shoot Milice the same turn? Yes, if no shot has occurred yet.  
- Can a Worker stay on a Location overnight? No, Workers must return to a Safe House or be arrested.  
- Can I place a Worker on a Field with airdropped Resources? Only if Resources are present at the start of the Day.  
- Do arrested Workers count toward available Workers? No, arrested Workers are permanently removed.  
- Can I perform an action without returning the Worker? Only if the Location has an orange shield with a star.  
- Can Soldiers be placed on a Location with a Resistance Worker? Yes, but only during Patrol Placement (via arrest). This causes the Worker to be arrested.
