# Deep Sea Adventure — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are a deep sea diver competing with others to collect the most valuable sunken treasure over three dangerous dives. All players share a single submarine and a limited air supply. The deeper you go, the more valuable the treasures—but if you don’t return to the sub before the air runs out, you lose everything you’ve collected. The player with the highest total points from successfully retrieved treasure after three dives wins.

### 2. Components  
- 2 custom dice (each showing 1–3 pips, with two faces per number)  
- 6 Sea Diver pieces (player pawns)  
- 1 Air Marker  
- 1 Submarine Board (with air track from 25 to 0)  
- 12 Blank Undersea Chips (used as placeholders)  
- 32 Undersea Treasure Chips:  
  - Level 1: Triangular (0–3 points) — 8 chips (2 each of values 0, 1, 2, 3)  
  - Level 2: Square (4–7 points) — 8 chips (2 each of 4, 5, 6, 7)  
  - Level 3: Pentagonal (8–11 points) — 8 chips (2 each of 8, 9, 10, 11)  
  - Level 4: Hexagonal (12–15 points) — 8 chips (2 each of 12, 13, 14, 15)  

*(Note: Values are hidden during play until revealed at the end of a dive.)*

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the Submarine Board in the center where all players can see it.  
2. Place the Air Marker on "25" on the air track.  
3. Shuffle each level of Treasure Chips separately, face down, so values are hidden.  
4. Arrange the Treasure Chips in a single line extending from the Submarine Board, ordered by level:  
   - First: Level 1 (Triangular)  
   - Then: Level 2 (Square)  
   - Then: Level 3 (Pentagonal)  
   - Last: Level 4 (Hexagonal)  
   *(The line may be straight or curved, but must be continuous.)*  
5. Place all 12 Blank Undersea Chips nearby as a supply.  
6. Each player chooses a Diver piece and places it on the Submarine Board, pointing downward (toward the treasure line).  
7. The player who most recently swam or been in the ocean takes the first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **3 rounds (dives)**. Each round proceeds as follows:

- All players begin on the Submarine, facing downward.  
- Players take turns clockwise.  
- On each turn, a player performs **four steps** in order (unless they have already returned to the sub).  
- A round ends when:  
  - The Air Marker reaches **0 or below**, or  
  - **All players have returned** to the Submarine.  
- After each round, perform cleanup.  
- The last player to return to the sub starts the next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Turn Sequence (4 Steps)

**Step 1: Breathe (Reduce Air)**  
- Move the Air Marker toward "0" by a number equal to the **number of Treasure Chips you are currently carrying this round**.  
- If the Air Marker reaches **0 or below**, you may **finish your turn**, but the round ends immediately after.

**Step 2: Declare Direction**  
- Announce whether you are **turning back** toward the Submarine.  
- Flip your Diver piece to face upward if turning back.  
- You may **only change direction once per round**. Once turned back, you must continue upward for the rest of the round.  
- If you **roll the dice before declaring**, you **must continue diving deeper** (cannot turn back this turn).

**Step 3: Swim (Roll and Move)**  
- Roll both dice. Total = sum of pips (range: 2–6).  
- **Subtract the number of Treasure Chips you are carrying this round** from your roll.  
  - Example: Roll 5, carrying 3 chips → move 2 spaces.  
- If result ≤ 0, you **do not move**.  
- Move your Diver along the line of chips in the direction it is facing.  
- **Skip over chips occupied by other players**—do not count them as spaces.  
- If movement would go beyond the last chip, stop at the final chip.

**Step 4: Treasure Hunt (Choose One Action)**  
a) **Do nothing**  
b) **Pick up the treasure chip** you are on:  
   - Take the chip (do **not** look at its value).  
   - Replace it with a **Blank Undersea Chip**.  
   - Place your Diver on the blank chip, facing the same direction.  
   - You are now carrying this treasure.  
   - You can carry **any number** of chips.  
c) **Drop a treasure chip** (only if on a **Blank Undersea Chip**):  
   - Remove the blank chip.  
   - Place one of your collected treasure chips there.  
   - Place your Diver on the treasure chip.  
   - **Cannot drop your last treasure if you have already turned back** (must return with at least one).  

> **Important**: You may not pick up and drop in the same turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End of Round Cleanup  
1. **Players who returned to the Submarine**:  
   - Flip over all treasure chips collected **this round**.  
   - Keep them face up in front of you for final scoring.  

2. **Players who did NOT return before air ran out**:  
   - Drop **all** treasure collected this round.  
   - Starting with the player **closest to the Submarine**, each non-survivor stacks their chips at the **end of the treasure line** in **groups of 3**.  
     - First 3 chips form a stack.  
     - Next 3 start a new stack behind it.  
   - These stacks act as **single chips** in future rounds (for movement, air cost, pickup/drop).  
   - Stacks are treated as one unit in all game mechanics.  

3. **Remove all Blank Undersea Chips** from the line.  
4. **Close gaps**: Slide remaining chips together to form a continuous line.  
5. **Next round starter**: The **last player to return** to the Sub (or farthest diver if no one returned) takes the first turn next round.

---

#### Game Conclusion (After 3 Rounds)  
- Total the **point values** of all treasure chips each player successfully brought back to the Sub across all three rounds.  
- **Winner**: Player with the **highest total score**.  

#### Tiebreakers:  
1. Player with the **most Level 4 (Hexagonal, 12–15 point) chips** wins.  
2. If still tied, the game ends in a **draw**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I turn back without carrying any treasure?**  
A: **No.** You must be carrying **at least one treasure chip** to turn back and return to the Sub.

**Q: What happens if I roll less than the number of chips I carry?**  
A: Your movement is **reduced to zero**. You do not move.

**Q: Can I pass over another diver and land on a chip behind them?**  
A: Yes. When moving, **skip over occupied chips entirely**—they are not counted in movement distance.

**Q: Can I drop treasure on a non-blank chip?**  
A: **No.** You can only drop treasure on a **Blank Undersea Chip**.

**Q: Can I change direction more than once per dive?**  
A: **No.** You may only **turn back once per round**. After turning, you must continue toward the Sub.

**Q: What if multiple players are equally far when determining next starter?**  
A: The **last to return** starts next. If no one returned, the **farthest diver** starts.

**Q: Do stacks count as one chip for air and movement?**  
A: **Yes.** A stack of 1, 2, or 3 chips counts as **one chip** for air cost and movement reduction.

**Q: Can I pick up a stack?**  
A: Yes. When landing on a stack, you pick up the **entire stack** as one unit.
