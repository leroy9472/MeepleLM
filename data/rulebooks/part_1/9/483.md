# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective

Diplomacy is a strategic board game set in pre-World War I Europe, where seven players represent the Great Powers: Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey. The game emphasizes negotiation, alliance-building, and betrayal.

**Objective**: A player wins by controlling 18 or more of the 34 supply centers on the board at the end of a Fall turn. The game can also end in a draw by mutual agreement, time limit, or turn limit (e.g., Fall 1907).

## 2. Components

- 70 Armies (artillery-shaped pieces)
- 70 Fleets (ship-shaped pieces)
- 147 Control Markers (flags to mark supply center ownership)
- 1 Game Board (map of Europe with provinces and supply centers)
- 1 Map Pad
- Order Sheets

## 3. Setup

Each player controls one of the seven Great Powers, determined randomly.

**Starting Positions**:

- **Austria**: A Vienna, A Budapest, F Trieste
- **England**: F London, F Liverpool, A Edinburgh
- **France**: A Paris, A Marseilles, F Brest
- **Germany**: A Berlin, A Munich, F Kiel
- **Italy**: A Rome, A Venice, F Naples
- **Russia**: A Moscow, A Warsaw, F St. Petersburg (North), F Sevastopol
- **Turkey**: F Ankara, A Constantinople, A Smyrna

Each player places their units on the board and uses control markers to denote their initial supply centers.

## 4. Gameplay Flow

Each year consists of two turns: Spring and Fall. After each Fall turn, a Winter Adjustment phase occurs.

### Turn Structure:

1. **Diplomatic Phase** (30 min for first turn, 15 min thereafter): Players negotiate alliances, strategies, and plans.
2. **Order Writing Phase**: Players secretly write orders for all units.
3. **Order Resolution Phase**: All orders are revealed and resolved simultaneously.
4. **Retreat and Disbanding Phase**: Dislodged units must retreat or are disbanded.
5. **Gaining and Losing Units Phase (Winter)**: After Fall turns only—players adjust unit count based on supply centers controlled.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Units

- **Armies (A)**: Occupy land or coastal provinces.
- **Fleets (F)**: Occupy sea or coastal provinces. Fleets on coastal provinces can move along coastlines only if adjacent by sea.

### Orders

Each unit may be given one of four orders:

- **Hold (H)**: Unit stays in place. Strength = 1 unless supported.
- **Move (M)**: Unit moves to an adjacent province. Fleets on split coasts (e.g., Spain) must specify coast.
- **Support (S)**: Unit supports another unit’s hold or move. Support adds strength. Must be adjacent and able to move to the supported province.
- **Convoy (C)**: Fleet transports an Army across sea. Requires:
  - Army move order to target.
  - Fleet convoy order specifying Army and path.
  - One Fleet per sea space in the path.
  - Only Fleets can convoy; only Armies can be convoyed.

### Key Rules

- **One Unit Per Province**: No stacking.
- **Simultaneous Resolution**: All moves happen at once.
- **Standoff (Bounce)**: Equal strength attacks on same province fail; units stay in origin.
- **Support Cut**: If a supporting unit is attacked from any adjacent province (except the one it supports), its support is cut.
- **Dislodgment**: A unit is dislodged if attacked with greater strength. It must retreat or be disbanded.
- **Retreat Rules**:
  - Cannot retreat to occupied provinces.
  - Cannot retreat to the province that dislodged it.
  - Cannot retreat to a province vacated by a standoff.
  - No valid retreat = disband.
- **No Self-Dislodgment**: A player cannot dislodge their own unit, even via support.
- **Convoy Disruption**: If any Fleet in a convoy chain is dislodged, the convoy fails.

## 6. Scoring & End Game

- **Supply Centers**: 34 total. Controlled if a player’s unit occupies the province at the end of a Fall turn.
- **Adjustments (Winter Phase)**:
  - If units < supply centers: build new units in home supply centers.
  - If units > supply centers: disband excess units.
  - Builds/disbands are simultaneous and secret.
- **Win Conditions**:
  1. Control 18+ supply centers.
  2. Draw by mutual agreement.
  3. Time or turn limit reached—player with most centers wins (shared if tied).

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Civil Disorder**: A player who fails to submit orders: units hold, no support, no retreats, no builds.
- **Self-Standoff**: Allowed. Two of your units can attack the same province to block others.
- **Convoy Paradoxes**: Resolved by precedence rules (e.g., support not cut if convoy succeeds via alternate route).
- **Multiple Convoy Routes**: Army moves if at least one route is intact.
- **Cutting Own Support**: Impossible. Attacking your own unit does not cut its support.
- **Exchanging Units**: Allowed via convoy (e.g., A1 to B, F convoy, A2 to A via convoy).
- **Land vs. Convoy Route**: If a player owns any convoying Fleet, the convoy is used. Otherwise, land route is used unless "via convoy" is specified.
