## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Yspahan is a strategic dice-placement and area control game set in a vibrant bazaar city. Players compete over three weeks (21 days) to earn the most victory points (VP) by constructing buildings, completing souks (colored shop groups), sending goods to the caravan, and optimizing resource collection. The player with the highest score at the end of week 3 wins.

### 2. Components  
- Main board (featuring neighborhoods, souks, and supervisor path)  
- Caravan Board (3 rows of camel spaces)  
- Tower (dice) Board  
- 8 white dice (2-player game)  
- Yellow dice (up to 3, purchasable)  
- Gold coins and camels (unlimited supply)  
- Player boards (with building tracks)  
- Colored cubes (one set per player)  
- Supervisor (white pawn)  
- First player marker (black pawn)  
- Day and week trackers  
- Deck of action cards  
- Building boards (with VP scoring)  

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player receives:  
   - A building board and all cubes of one color  
   - $2 in gold  
   - Places one cube on "0" of the score track  
2. Place the white supervisor pawn at the center intersection of the road.  
3. Set the day marker to 1 and the week marker to 1.  
4. Place the Caravan Board, Tower Board, and main board within reach.  
5. Shuffle the card deck and place it near the board; set discard pile beside it.  
6. Keep gold and camels in a general supply.  
7. Give the first player marker (black pawn) to the starting player.  
8. For 2-player game: use only 8 white dice (not 9) and 2 camels per caravan row.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A game lasts 21 turns (3 weeks × 7 days). Each day consists of one full game turn.

**Turn Order (2-player):**  
1. First player rolls all dice (8 white + any yellow dice they bought).  
2. First player may buy up to 3 yellow dice at $1 each; these are added to the roll and benefit only the first player.  
3. Dice are grouped by value on the Tower Board:  
   - Lowest value → camel space  
   - Highest value → gold space  
   - Middle values → shop spaces (in increasing order top to bottom)  
4. Players take actions in this order:  
   a. First player chooses a dice group and takes one action.  
   b. Second player chooses a dice group and takes one action.  
   c. First player chooses another dice group and takes a second action.  
5. After both actions, the turn ends.  
6. End of Day upkeep occurs.

**Note:** Purchased yellow dice remain on the board for the entire turn but are only usable by the first player. If the second player picks a group containing yellow dice, those yellow dice are removed from the board. The second player cannot select a group consisting solely of yellow dice.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### A. Dice Actions (Must choose one per action)  
When selecting a group of dice, perform one of the following actions based on the space the group occupies:

1. **Take Gold** – Take 1 gold per die in the group.  
   - With The Shop building: gain +2 extra gold.  
2. **Take Camels** – Take 1 camel per die in the group.  
   - With The Paddock building: gain +1 extra camel.  
3. **Place Cubes in Souks** – Place 1 cube per die into shops of matching color in any neighborhood.  
   - With The Hoist building: place +1 additional cube (if possible).  
   - Only one souk per color per neighborhood; must finish one before starting another.  
4. **Move Supervisor** – Move the white pawn a number of spaces equal to the die face value (not number of dice).  
   - May spend $1 per space to adjust movement by ±1 (max $3).  
   - With The Hammam building: adjust movement by up to ±3 spaces for free.  
   - If supervisor stops adjacent to a shop, the cube in that shop is sent to the Caravan Board.  
   - Owner may pay 1 camel per cube to place a new cube from their supply instead of removing from shop.  
   - Active player chooses order when multiple shops are affected.  
5. **Draw a Card** – Draw 1 card from the deck (minimum 1 die required; number doesn’t matter).  
   - May discard a card during this action to draw +1 extra card.  

**Card Use During Actions:**  
- When taking any dice action (except Move Supervisor), you may discard 1 card to increase the effect by +1 (e.g., +1 gold, +1 camel, +1 cube placed).  
- Cannot discard more than one card per action.  

#### B. Optional Actions (After Dice Action)  
After resolving a dice action, a player may:  

1. **Build a Building**  
   - Pay the required gold and/or camels.  
   - Place one of your cubes on the building space.  
   - Immediately score VP:  
     - 3rd building: 5 VP  
     - 4th: 6 VP  
     - 5th: 8 VP  
     - 6th: 10 VP  
   - Building powers activate immediately.  

2. **Play Cards for Effect**  
   - Discard a card to use its effect at any time during your turn.  
   - Multiple cards may be played per turn.  
   - Example effects: “Build without paying camels”, “Take 3 camels”, “Place a cube in any shop”, etc.  

#### Building Powers  
- **The Paddock**: +1 camel when using “Take Camels” action.  
- **The Shop**: +2 gold when using “Take Gold” action.  
- **The Hammam**: Adjust supervisor movement by ±3 for free; also allows spending gold to adjust further.  
- **The Caravanserai**: Draw 1 card whenever one of your cubes is sent to the caravan.  
   - Does not trigger when using a card to place a cube in the caravan.  
- **The Bazaar**: +2 VP for each completed souk at end of week.  
- **The Hoist**: +1 cube when placing cubes via dice action in a neighborhood.  

**Important**: Building powers only apply during dice actions, not when using card effects.

#### Caravan Board  
- Cubes are placed from bottom-left upward, one per camel used.  
- Scoring: When placing a cube on a numbered camel (1, 2, or 3), immediately score that many VP.  
- When a row is full (2 camels in 2-player), score the row:  
   - Score = number of your cubes × highest row you occupy (1–3).  
   - Then clear all cubes and restart.  
- Caravan is **not** cleared at end of week.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End of Day (Days 1–6):**  
- Remove all remaining dice from the Tower Board.  
- Advance day marker by 1.  
- Pass first player marker to the left (next player).  

**End of Week (Day 7):**  
- Score souks: For each completed souk (group of same-color shops in a neighborhood), score VP based on size:  
   - 2 shops: 3 VP  
   - 3 shops: 6 VP  
   - 4 shops: 12 VP  
   - With The Bazaar: +2 VP per completed souk  
- Remove all souk cubes from the board.  
- Score Caravan:  
   - Score = number of your cubes × highest row in which you have a cube  
   - Do **not** clear the Caravan Board  
- Reset:  
   - Reset day marker to 1  
   - Advance week marker by 1  
   - Reset supervisor to center  
- If end of week 3, game ends. Otherwise, continue.

**Final Scoring (End of Week 3):**  
- All end-of-week scoring occurs as above.  
- Additional VP sources:  
   - 1 VP per building constructed  
   - 3/5/8 VP for having goods in 2/3/4 neighborhoods  
   - Discarded goods via The Bazaar or Caravanserai (if applicable)  
- Highest total VP wins. Tie = shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use building powers with cards?**  
  No. Building powers only activate during dice actions. E.g., The Hoist does not give +1 cube when using a card to “place a cube in any shop”.  

- **Can I build two buildings in one turn?**  
  Yes. Since the first player takes two actions per turn in 2-player, they may build a building after each action (if they can pay).  

- **What happens to yellow dice if second player selects a mixed group?**  
  Yellow dice are removed from the board. Second player still performs the action with the remaining (white) dice.  

- **Can second player take a group of only yellow dice?**  
  No. Such a group is invalid for the second player.  

- **Can I move the supervisor beyond the edge of the road?**  
  No. You must either:  
   - Use exact movement, or  
   - Pay to adjust movement so it fits, or  
   - Move in the opposite direction  
  Supervisor cannot stop early or rebound.  

- **Can I place a cube in a shop next to the supervisor and have it sent immediately?**  
  No. Cubes are only sent when the “Move Supervisor” action is taken and movement ends.  

- **Do I pay one camel per cube or per shop to avoid losing cubes?**  
  One camel per cube. If two of your cubes are affected, you must pay 2 camels to replace both from your supply.  

- **Are components limited?**  
  No. Cubes, gold, and camels are unlimited.
