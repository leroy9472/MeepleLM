# 878: Vikings – Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective

In 878, players take control of either the invading Viking factions (Norsemen and Berserkers) or the defending English factions (Housecarls and Thegns) during the Viking invasions of England. The game simulates the struggle for control over English shires, with victory determined by territorial dominance or diplomatic resolution.

### Victory Conditions

- **Treaty Victory** (evaluated at end of Rounds V, VI, VII):
  - Game ends if all Factions of one or both sides have played their Treaty Cards.
  - Vikings win if 9 or more Viking Control Markers are removed from the Victory Track.
  - English win if fewer than 9 Viking Control Markers are removed from the Victory Track.
- **Expansion: War for Land and Gods**:
  - Vikings win immediately if all Churches are plundered.
  - English may also win if Vikings have no Control Markers on the map.
  - Vikings win if 14 or more Control Markers are on the map.

## 3. Setup

1. **Choose Modules**: Select optional expansions (e.g., War for Land and Gods, Runes & Prayer, Epic Battle Events).
2. **Assign Factions**: Each player takes one faction. With fewer than 4 players, one player may control both factions of a side.
3. **Prepare Decks**:
   - Each faction shuffles its 12-card deck (01–12 for standard; advanced allows customizing with cards 08–19).
   - Each faction draws 3 cards. If no Movement/Treaty card is drawn, reshuffle and redraw until one is obtained.
4. **Place Units**:
   - English place units in Shires marked with unit icons (per setup chart).
   - Each English faction places 4 additional units in any shire(s).
5. **Fyrd Setup**:
   - Place 10 Fyrd units, 2 yellow battle dice, and shuffled Fyrd deck near English players.
   - If using Epic Battle Events, add 3 random Epic Battle Cards to the Fyrd deck.
6. **Viking Setup**:
   - Shuffle B and C Leader Cards separately; place B deck on top of C deck to form Invasion Deck.
   - Place A Leader Card (Halfdan) face up; place listed units (17 Norsemen, 8 Berserkers) on card.
   - Place Leader token next to card.
7. **Alfred the Great**:
   - Place Alfred’s card near English players; place his token on Round V space.
8. **Control Markers**: Place one Viking Control Marker on each space of the Victory Track.
9. **Reinforcement Stockpiles**: Each faction places remaining units in front of them.
10. **Turn Order**: Place red, blue, green cubes in draw bag; place black (Norsemen) cube on first Turn space (Norsemen always start Round I).

## 4. Gameplay Flow

Each round consists of four turns (one per faction), played in random order after Round I. Each turn has five phases:

1. **Reinforcements Phase**
2. **Leader Phase**
3. **Movement Phase**
4. **Battle Phase**
5. **Draw Cards Phase**

At the end of each round:
- Advance Round Pawn.
- Return all Turn Cubes to the draw bag.
- Check game end conditions.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Reinforcements Phase
- **Vikings**:
  - The first Viking faction to act each round draws the top Leader Card from the Invasion Deck.
  - Place listed units on the Leader’s card.
  - Fled Viking units may be placed on any active Leader Card or Viking-controlled Coastal Shire.
- **English**:
  - Active faction places one unit per icon in each English-controlled Reinforcement City Shire.
  - Fled English units are placed in any English-controlled Reinforcement City Shire or on Alfred’s card (from Round V onward).
  - If no Reinforcement Cities are controlled, no reinforcements are placed.
- **Alfred the Great**:
  - First English faction in Round V or later places Alfred in any English-controlled City Shire with at least one English unit.
  - If no such shire exists, placement is delayed until one becomes available.
  - Place 4 Housecarl and 3 Thegn on Alfred’s card.

### Movement Card
- At the end of the Reinforcements Phase, the active faction must play exactly one Movement Card.
- If the only card available is the Treaty Card, it must be played.
- The Movement Card determines:
  - Maximum number of armies/leaders that may move.
  - Maximum number of shires each army/leader may move.

### Leader Phase
- Only occurs if the side has at least one Leader on the board.
- Invading Viking Leaders must be activated and moved to land during the round they are revealed.
- Leaders may move Units between their card and the shire they occupy at any time.
- Leaders may drop off or pick up Units before, during, or after movement.
- Units may not move more than once per turn.
- Leader movement follows the Movement Card limits.
- Leaders battle immediately upon entering an enemy-occupied shire.
- If a Leader fails to eliminate defenders on the first attack roll, they lose one movement point.
- A Leader is removed if they have no friendly units on their card or in the shire.

### Movement Phase
- Armies are formed from units in a shire; must include at least one unit from the active faction.
- Armies may move up to the number of shires allowed by the Movement Card.
- Movement stops when entering an enemy-occupied shire (battle occurs in Battle Phase).
- Units may not be picked up or dropped off during movement.
- Armies may split: a subset of units in a shire may form one army, the rest another.
- Marsh Shires may not be entered unless allowed by scenario or card.

### Battle Phase
- Occurs when opposing units occupy the same shire.
- Active faction’s side is attacker; opposing side is defender.
- **Battle Sequence**:
  1. **Fyrd Draw**: If English defend a City Shire with at least one Housecarl or Thegn, draw one Fyrd card and add units.
  2. **Event Cards**: Players may play event cards (max 2 per faction per round; 1 of each type per battle).
  3. **Dice Rolling**:
     - Defender rolls first.
     - Each faction rolls one die per unit (up to faction die limit).
     - Fyrd roll their own yellow dice (max 2).
     - Rune/Prayer dice may be rolled (max 1 per faction per battle).
  4. **Result Resolution** (in order):
     - **Runes/Prayer Effects**: Apply if dice combinations are met.
     - **Hit Results**: Remove opponent’s unit (opponent chooses which).
       - First English hit in a battle must remove a Berserker if possible.
     - **Flee Results**: Remove own unit to Fled Units area (Fyrd return to stockpile).
     - **Command Results**: Move one own unit to adjacent friendly-occupied shire. If it’s the last unit with a Leader, the Leader may move with it.
  5. **Alternating Rolls**: After first exchange, attackers roll, then defenders, etc., until one side is eliminated.
- **Multiple Armies in One Shire**: All units combine into a single battle group.

### Draw Cards Phase
- Active faction draws back up to 3 cards.
- If no Movement/Treaty card is held, reveal, reshuffle, and redraw until one is obtained.

## 6. Scoring & End Game

### End of Round Check
