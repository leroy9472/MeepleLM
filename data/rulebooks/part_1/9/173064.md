# LEAVING EARTH — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Leaving Earth*, players take on the role of national space agencies during the early Space Age (1956–1976). The goal is to complete space missions—such as launching probes, landing astronauts, or discovering extraterrestrial life—to earn victory points. The player with the most points when the game ends wins. Missions reflect real and speculative milestones of space exploration, blending historical accuracy with speculative science.

### 2. Components
- 50 advancement cards  
- 129 component cards (rockets, capsules, probes, astronauts, supplies, samples)  
- 5 space agency cards  
- 20 spacecraft tokens  
- 20 spacecraft cards  
- 1 calendar marker  
- 90 outcome cards (success, minor failure, major failure)  
- 50 funding notes ($10 and $25 denominations)  
- 32 location cards (Earth, Moon, Mars, etc., including unexplored variants)  
- 23 mission cards (easy, medium, hard)  
- 1 eight-sided die  
- 20 time tokens  
- 1 rulebook  
- 1 calendar (1956–1976)

### 3. Setup
1. **Choose Agencies**: Each player selects a space agency, taking its 4 spacecraft cards and matching tokens.  
2. **Draw Missions**: Separate mission cards by difficulty (easy, medium, hard). For a normal game, draw 4 easy and 2 medium missions. Reveal them.  
3. **Lay Out Locations**: Arrange location cards (e.g., Earth, Moon, Mars). For explorable locations (Moon, Mars, Venus, etc.), shuffle their multiple cards face down, draw one randomly, and place it face down ("unexplored") in its position. Return others to the box.  
4. **Prepare Decks**:  
   - Set out component and advancement cards in stacks.  
   - Shuffle outcome cards into a draw deck.  
   - Place time tokens, die, and money within reach.  
5. **Set Calendar**: Place the marker on 1956.  
6. **Initial Funding**: Each player starts with $25 at the beginning of 1956.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each year follows this sequence:
1. **Start of Year**:  
   - All agencies receive $25 funding.  
   - Check start-of-year missions (e.g., Space Station).  
   - Turn in samples for rewards (tech or money).  
2. **Turn Order**:  
   - Lowest score (points minus 2 per dead astronaut) goes first. Ties broken by die roll.  
   - Players take turns in order until all pass consecutively.  
3. **On Your Turn**: Perform any number of actions in any order:  
   - Research advancements  
   - Buy components  
   - Assemble/disassemble spacecraft (on Earth)  
   - Maneuver spacecraft  
   - Dock or separate spacecraft (rendezvous)  
   - Survey, collect samples, repair, heal, or cooperate  
4. **End of Year**:  
   - Repair all damaged components and heal incapacitated astronauts on Earth.  
   - Check off-Earth survival:  
     - Astronauts must have health, life support, and supplies.  
     - Draw outcome for each capsule’s life support (if advancement owned).  
     - Consume 1 supply per 5 astronauts.  
   - Move calendar forward.  
   - Remove one time token from each spacecraft with tokens.  
   - Game ends if past 1976, no missions remain, or a player has an unbeatable lead.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Mass & Thrust**:  
  Thrust required = mass × maneuver difficulty.  
  - Mass: Sum of component masses (e.g., probe = 1, Apollo = 2).  
  - Thrust: Generated by discarding rockets or firing ion thrusters.  
- **Maneuvering**:  
  - Rockets: Single-use; discard to generate thrust.  
  - Ion Thrusters: Reusable; generate thrust/year. Only usable on multi-year maneuvers.  
  - Multi-Year Maneuvers: Add time tokens (1 per ⏳). Cannot act until all tokens are removed.  
  - Faster/Slower: Double difficulty to halve time (rounded up); add extra time for ion thrust.  
- **Hazards**: Resolved in order upon arrival:  
  - **Radiation (⊙)**: Roll d8 per astronaut. Incapacitated if roll ≤ radiation level × years.  
  - **Atmospheric Entry (○)**: Damaged capsules and those without heat shields (Aldrin, Eagle) are destroyed. Others draw Re-entry outcome.  
  - **Landing (△)**: Draw Landing outcome. Optional if marked (△).  
  - **Exploration (①–⑤)**: Reveal unexplored location card or destroy spacecraft.  
- **Rendezvous**:  
  - Dock or separate two spacecraft in same location (no time tokens).  
  - Requires Rendezvous advancement. Draw outcome.  
  - Astronauts must have seats after separation.  
- **Research & Outcomes**:  
  - Pay $10 to research an advancement; add required number of random outcomes.  
  - When using advancement, draw one outcome:  
    - Success: Proceed.  
    - Minor/Major Failure: Apply effect (e.g., damage component).  
  - Pay $5 to remove failure, $10 to remove success, or shuffle back.  
- **Astronaut Skills**:  
  - **Mechanic (🔧)**: Repair all non-astronaut components by consuming 1 supply.  
  - **Doctor (✚)**: Heal all other astronauts on spacecraft.  
  - **Pilot (✈)**: Improve Landing/Rendezvous outcomes by one step (e.g., major failure → minor).  
- **Survival Off Earth**:  
  - Incapacitated astronauts die if not healed by year end.  
  - Life support: Draw outcome per capsule; failure kills all aboard.  
  - Supplies: 1 unit feeds up to 5 astronauts. Unfed astronauts die.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Scoring**:  
  - Complete a mission: Take card (worth points). All others gain $10.  
  - Dead astronaut: −2 points (tucked under agency card).  
  - Extraterrestrial Life: Turn in sample from a life-harboring location to gain free advancement or clear outcomes.  
- **End Game Triggers**:  
  - Calendar passes 1976.  
  - No missions left.  
  - One player has an unbeatable lead.  
- **Winner**: Highest score (mission points minus astronaut deaths).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Ion Thrusters**: If successful but insufficient thrust, perform automatic maneuver if present; else, take 1 time token and stay. A successful ion thruster cannot fire again in the same year.  
- **Rendezvous Testing**: Shortcut allows testing without docking/undocking repeatedly.  
- **Supplies on Planets**: Free to collect if location is revealed.  
- **Unexplored Locations**: Can be surveyed (with Surveying) or explored via maneuver. Suborbital Flight requires an astronaut.  
- **Turn Order**: Based only on completed missions and dead astronauts—no other bonuses.  
- **Component Limits**: Unlimited; use substitutes if needed.  
- **Cooperation**: Can share components, money, or research. Shared advancements get same number of outcomes.
