4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn:  
1. **Roll**: Roll all five dice.  
2. **Re-roll**: You may re-roll any dice (except Dynamite) up to two times.  
   - After second re-roll, you may re-roll any die not previously kept.  
   - Dynamite dice cannot be re-rolled once rolled.  
3. **Resolve Dice in Order**: All dice results must be resolved in strict order:  
   a. **Arrow**: Take one arrow token per Arrow die immediately.  
      - If this takes the last arrow, trigger Indian attack:  
        - Each player loses one life point per arrow they hold.  
        - All players discard their arrows.  
        - Turn continues; any remaining Arrow results are resolved.  
   b. **Dynamite**: Cannot be re-rolled.  
      - If 3+ Dynamite are rolled, you lose 1 life point.  
      - If this kills you, turn ends immediately.  
      - Otherwise, resolve remaining dice.  
   c. **Bull’s Eye "1" and "2"**: Resolve simultaneously.  
      - "1": Choose adjacent player (left or right) to lose 1 life.  
      - "2": Choose player exactly two seats away.  
      - If 2–3 players remain, treat "2" as "1".  
      - All shots assigned before resolution; resolve simultaneously.  
      - Overkill is allowed. Eliminations revealed after all shots.  
   d. **Beer**: Choose any player (including yourself) to gain 1 life.  
      - Cannot exceed starting life total.  
      - Wasted if target is at max life.  
   e. **Gatling**: If 3+ rolled, activate Gatling Gun:  
      - All other players lose 1 life.  
      - Discard all your arrows.  
      - Limited to once per turn.  
5. End of turn: Play passes clockwise.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Life Points**: Publicly tracked. Cannot exceed starting amount.  
- **Arrows**: Taken from central pile. Used for Indian attacks and character abilities.  
- **Re-rolls**: Up to two re-rolls allowed. Dynamite is locked once rolled.  
- **Character Abilities** (examples):  
  - **Bart Cassidy**: Take an arrow instead of losing life from Bull’s Eye or Gatling (not Indians or Dynamite). Cannot take last arrow in pile.  
  - **Black Jack**: May re-roll Dynamite dice unless 3+ are showing.  
  - **Calamity Janet**: Use "1" and "2" Bull’s Eyes interchangeably.  
  - **El Gringo**: Attacker takes one arrow when you lose life (not from Indians or Dynamite).  
  - **Jesse Jones**: If at 4 or fewer life, gain 2 life per Beer used on self.  
  - **Jourdonnais**: Loses only 1 life to Indian attack, regardless of arrows held.  
  - **Kit Carlson**: For each Gatling die, discard 1 arrow from any player.  
  - **Lucky Duke**: May roll up to four times (three re-rolls).  
  - **Paul Regret**: Immune to Gatling Gun damage.  
  - **Pedro Ramirez**: May discard one arrow per life point lost.  
  - **Rose Doolan**: Use "1" to hit up to 2 away; "2" to hit up to 3 away.  
  - **Sid Ketchum**: At start of turn, choose any player to gain 1 life.  
  - **Slab the Killer**: Once per turn, use a Beer die to double a Bull’s Eye (2 damage to one target). Beer does not heal.  
  - **Suzy Lafayette**: If no Bull’s Eyes at end of turn, gain 2 life.  
  - **Vulture Sam**: Gain 2 life when another player is eliminated.  
  - **Willy the Kid**: Gatling activates with only 2 dice (once per turn).

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends immediately when:  
a) **Sheriff is eliminated**:  
   - If a Renegade is the sole survivor, Renegade wins.  
   - Otherwise, Outlaws win (even if all are dead).  
b) **All Outlaws and Renegades are eliminated**:  
   - Sheriff and Deputies win.  
Special cases:  
- If Sheriff is killed and two Renegades remain (8-player), Outlaws win.  
- If all players die simultaneously (e.g., Indian attack), Outlaws win.  
- Eliminated players reveal roles and discard arrows.  
- Team wins: Deputies and Outlaws win as a team if their condition is met.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can Beer save you from Dynamite?** No. Dynamite resolves before Beer. If Dynamite reduces you to 0 life, you are eliminated before Beer heals.  
- **Simultaneous Eliminations**: All dice effects resolve in order. Game ends immediately after the condition is met (e.g., last Outlaw dies → game ends before Gatling resolves if it would kill Sheriff).  
- **El Gringo’s Arrow**: Attacker takes one arrow per turn in which they damage El Gringo (even if multiple dice). Arrow taken during damage resolution, before Gatling discards arrows.  
- **Suzy Lafayette**: Only final dice matter. If final roll has no Bull’s Eyes, she gains 2 life after all other effects.  
- **Vulture Sam**: Does not gain life if eliminated simultaneously with another player.  
- **Pedro Ramirez**: Cannot discard arrows for life lost to Indian attack.  
- **Rose Doolan in 4-player**: A "2" can hit a player 3 away, which may loop to adjacent player — valid under ability.
