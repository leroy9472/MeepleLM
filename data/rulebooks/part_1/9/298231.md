---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game is played over two **Eras**, each consisting of a series of **auctions**. Each auction results in one structure being constructed.

#### Era 1  
- Players may only bid with Era 1 buildings (no dot, right side of board).  
- Ends when **any one player** has constructed all of their Era 1 buildings.

#### Era 2  
- Players unlock Era 2 buildings (with dot) and their Wonder.  
- Ends when **all players** have constructed all buildings and their Wonder(s).  
- The first player to finish all constructions gets the **Large Key to the City** (10 Prestige).  
- In 3–4 player games, the second player to finish gets the **Small Key** (4 Prestige).

---

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Auctions  
An auction proceeds in four steps:  

**1. Determine Start Bidder**  
- **Era 1 start**: Random player.  
- **Era 2 start**: Player with the lowest initiative value on their revealed Wonder card.  
- After any player finishes Era 2: Remaining player with lowest Wonder initiative starts next auction.  
- Otherwise: Winner of last auction starts.

**2. Place Starting Bid**  
- Place any available bid (building) number-side up in:  
  - Any unoccupied neighborhood on the **Central Island**, OR  
  - Any unoccupied neighborhood **adjacent** to an already-constructed structure (any player, any island).  
- Cannot start with Wonder unless it’s your last remaining structure.

**3. Continue Bidding (clockwise)**  
Each player must:  
- **Outbid**: Place a higher-numbered bid in an unoccupied neighborhood **adjacent to the most recent bid**.  
- **Pass**: Exit the auction. Cannot re-enter.  
- **Place Wonder (Era 2 only)**: Place Wonder in an unoccupied neighborhood adjacent to the most recent bid. This ends the auction **unless** the Wonder is the Hammer (can be outbid).

**4. End the Auction**  
Ends when:  
- All players except the current highest bidder have passed, OR  
- No unoccupied adjacent neighborhoods exist, OR  
- A Wonder is placed (unless Hammer is involved).  

Then:  
1. Flip winning bid number-side down (constructed). Wonders remain as-is.  
2. Return all unsuccessful bids to owners.  
3. Winner collects the disc (if any) from the neighborhood.  
4. If a Wonder was constructed, resolve its effect immediately.

#### Collecting Discs  
When constructing in a neighborhood with a disc:  

- **Neighborhood Disc (colored)**: Place in the leftmost empty space of matching row on player board.  
  - If row is full (4 discs placed), place on visionary illustration → worth **10 Prestige** each at game end ("Shoot the Moon!").  
  - Note: Each player starts with a disc already in the "2" column → first disc goes in "3".  

- **Patron Disc (A, B, C, D)**: Place on visionary illustration. Value = hidden number on matching Patron Value Tile. Player may peek at tile at any time.  

- **Wild Disc**: Assign a color when collected. Treated as that color permanently.  

- **Commissions Disc**: Place on visionary illustration. At end of Era 2, each Commissions Disc scores **1 Prestige per item** (patron discs, excess neighborhood discs, keys, commissions discs) on visionary illustration (including itself).

---

#### Islands & Neighborhoods  
- Islands: 1 Central + up to 4 Outer.  
- Neighborhoods: Colored regions (yellow, green, white, brown), each holds 1 bid/structure.  
- **Adjacent**: Share a border (edge, not corner) or connected by a bridge.  
- Unoccupied: No bid or structure present.

---

#### Wonder & Wonder Cards  
- Each player has 1 Wonder (2 in 2-player).  
- At **start of Era 2**, each player chooses 1 (or 2 in 2-player) of their dealt Wonder Cards.  
- Reveal simultaneously. Unchosen cards return to box.  
- **Initiative Value (G)**: Lowest value starts Era 2 auction. In 2-player, sum both chosen cards; tiebreak by lowest single card.

**Wonder Rules**:  
- Wonders **automatically win** an auction when placed (unless outbid by Hammer).  
- Do not have a bid number.  
- Do not have height → do **not** contribute to island control.  
- Can only be placed if adjacent to most recent bid (except Capital Building).  
- Wonders do **not** start an auction unless no other bids remain.

**Wonder Effects**:  
- Resolved immediately upon construction.  
- Most effects are one-time, except **The Hammer** and **Atelier** (ongoing).  
- See Wonder FAQ for specific card effects.

---

#### Panorama Cards  
- Two revealed at setup. Scored at **end of each Era**.  
- Score **per instance** of fulfilling the objective.  
- A single structure can fulfill multiple instances and both cards.  
- Wonders count toward Panorama objectives.

---

#### Island Control  
At end of **each Era**, score for each island:  
- Player with **most tall buildings** → 5 Prestige.  
- Tie? Compare **medium**, then **short** buildings among tied players.  
- Still tied? All tied players score 5.  
- Wonders **do not** count.
