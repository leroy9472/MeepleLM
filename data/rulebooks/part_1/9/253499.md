## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective
- Five empires (Bear, Lion, Horse, Elephant, Eagle) are at war.
- Players represent secret societies betting on the war's outcome.
- Primary goal: Maximize points by aligning high loyalty with empires that control many cities at game end.

2. Components
- 1 Game Board
- 4 Player Boards
- 20 Loyalty Tokens (5 per player, 1 per empire)
- 40 Empire Cards (8 per empire)
- 100 Banner Cubes (20 per empire)
- 36 Agent Tokens (9 per player)
- 4 Turn Trackers
- 1 First Player Token

3. Setup
- Each player chooses a player board, agent set, and loyalty tokens.
- Place "1" turn marker beside "Start"; others near turn tracker.
- For each empire:
  - Place banner cubes beside board near council.
  - Place starting banners on regions with banner icons.
  - Shuffle empire cards into 5 decks; place beside corresponding empires.
- Determine first player; give them first player marker.
- Each player shuffles their 5 loyalty tokens and places them face-down on their player board loyalty slots (Devout x4, Dutiful x3, Affiliated x2, Unallied x0, Opposed x-1). Players may peek at their tokens anytime.

4. Gameplay Flow
Each of 4 rounds consists of 4 phases:
1. Deploy Agents Phase
2. Empire Turns Phase
3. Cleanup Phase
4. Swap Phase

After each round, advance turn marker and pass first player marker clockwise. Game ends immediately when 4th turn marker is placed (skip final Cleanup and Swap).

5. Core Mechanics
- Deploy Agents Phase:
  - Except first turn: Starting with first player, each player retrieves 1 agent from board.
  - Starting with first player, players take turns placing 1 agent each on open council positions until all players have placed 2 agents (3 in 2-player game).
  - Optional: During deployment, may place agent on any map region instead of council (max 2 per player; not same region).
- Empire Turns Phase:
  - Proceed clockwise from Bear to Eagle.
  - For each empire, resolve council positions in order: Sheriff → Steward → Marshal → Chancellor.
  - Control of a council position:
    - Player with agent on it controls it.
    - If empty, player with next agent to the right (clockwise) in that council controls it.
    - If no agents in council, position does nothing.
  - Actions (choose one per controlled position):
    - Add Banner(s): Add specified banners to any region(s) controlled by this empire.
    - Attack: Move banners from adjacent region to enemy-controlled region. Cannot abandon conquered region (must leave 1 banner). Only one attack per action.
    - Draw Empire Card(s): Draw cards based on icons controlled by empire.
    - Swap Agent: Swap this agent with another in same council; immediately take swapped position's action.
- Combat:
  - Occurs when attacking banners enter enemy-controlled region.
  - Banners lost 1:1 until one side depleted.
  - Forts: Destroy 1 attacking banner upon entry.
  - Winner controls region.
- Checking Supply:
  - At end of each empire's turn, reduce banners in each region to 4 (6 if region has Farm).
- Empire Cards:
  - Draw via council actions or card effects.
  - Hand limit: 5 cards (enforced in Cleanup Phase).
  - Play timing: Immediately before, during, or after any action taken for a council position you control.
  - Playing: Choose ability; pay cost by discarding cards (including played card). First ability on card costs only itself.
  - Effects may break standard rules.
  - Discarded cards return to their empire's deck and are shuffled in.
- Advanced Rule – Agents on Map:
  - May deploy agents to regions during Deploy Agents Phase.
  - Counts as city for player in final scoring.
  - Max 2 per player; regions may have multiple agents (not same player).
  - Retrieved at start of next Deploy Agents Phase.

6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends when 4th turn marker is placed.
- Reveal all loyalty tokens.
- For each empire:
  - Count cities controlled by that empire.
  - Multiply by loyalty value (Devout x4, Dutiful x3, Affiliated x2, Unallied x0, Opposed x-1).
- Sum all 5 empire scores for total.
- Highest score wins.
- Tiebreakers:
  1. Player who swapped loyalty tokens the fewest times.
  2. Player with most empire cards in hand.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- Can play cards for positions you control without an agent.
- May play multiple cards per turn.
- Empty region: No banners present.
- Friendly: Same empire as region controller.
- If empire runs out of banners, cannot place more.
- Cards allowing banner movement cannot abandon conquered regions unless specified.
- Chancellor's Swap requires swapping with another agent (not empty position).
- Must choose valid action; cannot skip if one option has no valid target.
- "Kill all banners involved in attack" includes both attackers and defenders.
- Agent movement cards (e.g., Eagle) allow using action of new position; original action is forfeited.
- After moving agent via card, play continues from position clockwise after original position.
- Supply limits checked only for active empire at end of its turn.
- Banners added via card during attack are permanent.
