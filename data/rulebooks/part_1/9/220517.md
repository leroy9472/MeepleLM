### 1. Lore & Objective
In *The Shipwreck Arcana*, players are fortune tellers trapped in a drowned world. Using logic and deduction, they must work together to predict each other’s hidden fates to escape. The goal is to make **7 correct predictions** before the **doom tracker reaches 7**.

A variant, *Creatures from the Deep*, replaces the score objective: players must **defeat 3 sea creatures** by using fate tokens to kill them. Correct predictions provide resources (fate tokens) to attack creatures or reduce doom.

### 2. Components
- 20 Arcana cards (A)
- 1 The Hours card (B)
- 2 Score/doom trackers (C)
- 1 Token bag (D)
- 21 Fate tokens (E): values 1–7, with hour pips (1–3)
- 35 Number line tokens (F): 7 per player (values 1–7), in 5 colors

*Creatures from the Deep Expansion:*
- 12 Creature Cards
- 5 Asymmetric Adventurer Cards

### 3. Setup
1. Place **The Hours** card to the left of the play area. Set the **green score tracker to 0**. Set the **red doom tracker** based on difficulty:
   - 0 = Easy
   - 2 = Normal
   - 4 = Hard
   - 6 = Doomed
2. Shuffle the Arcana deck (face-up). Place the top 4 cards to the right of The Hours.
3. Give each player a full set of 7 number line tokens. Remove extras if fewer than 5 players.
4. Place all 21 fate tokens in the bag and shuffle.
5. Choose a starting player. Play proceeds clockwise.

*Creatures from the Deep Setup:*
- Place 3 randomly selected Creature Cards above the tableau: one Level 1, one Level 2 (face-up), one Level 3 (face-down).
- Set red doom tracker to 0 (or higher for difficulty).
- Green tracker is not used.
- Each player draws a random character card with a unique ability.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On a player’s turn (the **active player**), follow these steps:

1. **Draw**: Draw fate tokens until holding 2. If starting with 1, draw only 1.
2. **Play**: Play 1 fate token face-up in front of 1 of the 5 central cards (The Hours + 4 Arcana), obeying its ability. If multiple options exist, choose one.
3. **Predict (Optional)**: Allies may make **one** prediction about the value of the fate still in the active player’s hand (e.g., “We predict your fate is 5”). They may discuss and ask the active player to flip number line tokens to show possibilities.
4. **Resolve**:
   - **Correct**: Move green tracker up 1. In *Creatures*, choose:
     - Use the fate to damage/kill a creature, OR
     - Reduce doom (1–3 spaces based on fate’s hour pips).
   - **Incorrect**: Move red doom tracker up 1.
   - Discard the fate. Reset number line tokens.
5. **Fade**: Check all Arcana cards. A card **fades** if the total hour pips of fates in front of it ≥ its moon count (duration).
   - Discard all fates in front of it.
   - Flip the card and place it below the play area (faded power unlocked).
   - Move red doom tracker up 2 **unless** a correct prediction was made this turn.
   - Refill the empty spot with the top card of the Arcana deck.

*Special Rules:*
- **The Hours**: If you cannot legally play on any Arcana card, play on The Hours. Then move that fate one card to the right (onto the leftmost Arcana card).
- **Faded Powers**: Once per turn, **before or after** playing, the active player or group may use **one** faded power. Using a power does **not** force a prediction.
- **Only one power may be used per turn.**

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Fate Tokens**: Black tokens with values 1–7. Hour pips:
  - 1, 2, 3 → 1 pip
  - 4, 5, 6 → 2 pips
  - 7 → 3 pips
- **Number Line Tokens**: Players use these to track deductions about others’ hidden fates. Allies may ask the player to flip tokens to show possible/eliminated values.
- **Faded Powers**: When an Arcana card fades, its back-side power becomes available. Examples:
  - *Sorrows (Twice)*: Group makes 2 predictions.
  - *Shadows (+1)*: Active player treats hidden fate as +1 this turn.
  - *Sinners (Discard Lower)*: Active player discards a visible fate lower than their hidden fate.
  - *Sparrows (Cycle)*: Active player replaces an empty Arcana card.
- **Communication**: No verbal or nonverbal hints. Players must avoid revealing information about their hidden fate.

*Creatures from the Deep Mechanics:*
- **Character Abilities** (each usable once per creature defeated):
  - **Defender**: Prevent +1 doom when playing on The Hours.
  - **Summoner**: Retrieve a faded card to use its power.
  - **Vanquisher**: Remove an empty Arcana card.
  - **Mage**: Redraw newly drawn fate(s).
  - **Mystic**: Move/flip visible fates; prevent fading by relocating fates.
- **Creature Defeat**:
  - Place fate tokens on a creature to meet its condition (e.g., three 7s).
  - Upon defeat, discard creature, return fates to bag, reveal Level 3 creature.
- **Fading Penalty**: If a card fades and no correct prediction is made, the **highest revealed creature attacks**, advancing doom by its level (1, 2, or 3).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends when **either tracker reaches 7**.

- **Standard Game**:
  - **Win**: Green score tracker reaches 7.
  - **Lose**: Red doom tracker reaches 7.

- **Creatures from the Deep**:
  - **Win**: Defeat all 3 sea creatures.
  - **Lose**: Red doom tracker reaches 7.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I play on The Hours if I could use a power to play elsewhere?**  
  Yes. You may choose to play on The Hours even if a power (like Shadows) would let you play elsewhere. But if you **use** the power and can now play elsewhere, you **must** play elsewhere.

- **What if I play illegally?**  
  Announce it. Leave the fate, discard the hidden one, skip Predict/Resolve, proceed to Fade.

- **Multiple predictions (e.g., Wish + Sorrows)**:  
  If **any** prediction is correct, doom does not advance and score increases by 1. Only one doom penalty per turn, even if all predictions are wrong.

- **Using Sinners to discard the fate just played?**  
  Yes, if it is lower than the hidden fate.

- **Shadows effect duration**:  
  Only lasts this turn. Hidden fate reverts to original value next turn.

- **No visible fates for Storms?**  
  Impossible—fates are played before this power is used.

- **The Thief**: After playing elsewhere, move a visible fate **higher than your hidden fate** to The Thief. If none, announce it.

- **The Fall**: Fades if sum of its visible fates ≥ 2× the active player’s hidden fate. Announced after playing.
