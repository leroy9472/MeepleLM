# D-Day at Omaha Beach – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
D-Day at Omaha Beach simulates the June 6, 1944 assault by US forces on a heavily defended stretch of the Normandy coast. The player commands US amphibious units attempting to establish a beachhead against entrenched German defenders. The game is solitaire, with German forces controlled by a card-driven system that simulates unpredictable but coherent enemy behavior.

Victory is determined by controlling key terrain and achieving objectives over time. The player wins by earning sufficient Victory Points (VPs) by the end of the scenario or avoiding catastrophic losses.

### 2. Components

- US Infantry Loss Boxes (1st and 29th Divisions)
- Engineer and Command Post Tracks

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn follows this sequence:

**I. US Amphibious Operations Phase**
- Draw landing card for East, then West sector.
- Apply landing results (drift, delay, mine explosions).
- Land all units from Beach Landing Boxes to current tide-line hex.
- Place arriving units in Beach Landing Boxes.

**II. Event Phase (skip Turn 1)**
- Draw event card and implement effect.

**III. German Fire Phase**
- Draw fire card for East sector, resolve fire and actions.
- Draw fire card for West sector, resolve fire and actions.
- Apply German fire using German Fire Chart.
- Resolve artillery fire if applicable (Turn 4+).
- Remove disruption from German units matching card colors.

**IV. US Engineer Phase (Turns 2–22)**
- Clear beach obstacles in eligible hexes.
- Place Cleared markers.

**V. US Action Phase**
- Perform up to 2 actions per division (3 in extended game).
- Free actions allowed for rangers, heroes, disrupted units, HQs, generals, units in command.
- Actions: Move, Climb Bluff, Climb Cliff, Attack, Barrage, Engineer Base, CP, Disruption removal.

**VI. End of Turn**
- Discard all cards.
- Advance Turn Marker.
- Shuffle deck if indicated on Turn Track.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### US Amphibious Operations
- Units land via Beach Landing Boxes.
- Landing checks determine drift, delay, or mine damage.
- Units delayed voluntarily after Turn 7 may be placed on later turns.
- Units delayed involuntarily or after Turn 10 may be placed in any Beach Landing Box.
- At high tide, units passing through uncleared obstacles may lose a step.

#### German Communication
A German unit or position is in communication if a path can be traced to any exit hex (A–G) without passing through:
- US-controlled hexes (occupied or adjacent to 2+ step infantry or armor)
- Beach, pavilion adjacent to beach, or rough hexes

Exceptions:
- Adjacent US unit negates US control for communication.
- Occupied reinforcement position may trace through one adjacent bocage hex under US control.
- Unoccupied positions may be in communication even if hex is US-controlled.

#### Depth Markers
- Placed beneath German units to represent full strength.
- Added via events or failed US attacks.
- Pools: WN, Building, Mobile.
- Priorities for placement:
  1. Closest to US unit.
  2. By position type: WN (1-hex), WN (2-hex), Reinforcement.
  3. Lowest ID number (no ID = 0), then lowest letter.

#### German Reinforcements
- Triggered by event cards.
- Draw from Tactical Pool first (no depth), then Division Pool (with depth).
- Placed in unoccupied, in-communication reinforcement position in specified zone.
- Priorities:
  1. Adjacent to US unit (lowest number).
  2. Within 2 hexes of US unit (lowest number).
  3. Lowest numbered position.

#### US Actions
- Two actions per division (three in extended game).
- Free actions: rangers, heroes, disrupted, climb markers, HQs, generals, units in command.
- Stacking: 2 units per hex; HQs, generals, heroes do not count.
- Excess stacking at end of phase must be eliminated.

#### Combat
**Attack Requirements:**
- Must include at least one infantry/ranger adjacent to target.
- Other units may join if within range and conditions met (adjacent, in command, etc.).

**Artillery Support:**
- Must be in command of HQ (not general).
- Must have observing infantry in same command.
- Cannot be in German field of fire unless armored.

**Barrage:**
- Tank barrage: in range, not adjacent, in FoF or observed.
- Artillery barrage (extended game): same as attack, plus CP or HQ command.
- Naval barrage: expend marker; requires observing infantry with radio or in command.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Catastrophic Loss
- **Turns 1–16:** 8 regular infantry units reduced to 1 step or eliminated (per division).
- **Turns 17–32:** 14 such units.
- Game lost immediately if either division suffers catastrophic loss.

#### Victory Conditions

**First Waves (Turn 16):**
- 19+ VPs = victory.
- VP sources:
  - 1 VP per controlled WN hex (2 for 2-hex WN, only if both hexes controlled).
  - 1 VP per controlled German reinforcement position.
  - 5 VPs per fully controlled draw.

**D-Day at Omaha Beach (Turn 32):**
- 40+ VPs = victory.
- VP sources:
  - 1 VP per controlled VP-marked reinforcement hex (42 total).
  - 4 VPs per draw fully cleared and under control.
  - 1 VP per non-infantry, non-HQ unit on high ground.
  - 1 VP per armor/infantry step exiting via lettered exit (in communication).
  - 1 VP per ranger step exiting via F or G.
  - –1 VP per uncontrolled WN hex.
  - –1 VP per German unit in Kampfgruppe Meyer box.

**Beyond the Beach:**
- Same VP sources as full game, but thresholds adjusted:
  - 45+ VPs = Tactical victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a unit attack and barrage the same hex in one phase?** No. A hex cannot be both attacked and barraged in the same US Action Phase.
- **Can multiple tanks barrage the same hex?** Yes, each barrage is separate.
- **Can artillery barrage an unrevealed reinforcement?** No. Only WN (revealed or not) or revealed reinforcements.
- **Do garrisons block German advance?** No. They are removed if the destination hex is successfully advanced into.
- **Can a unit with a climb cliff marker move?** No. It must either cross the cliff or remove the marker.
- **Can a CP command through German units?** No. Command range cannot be traced through German units.
- **Can German armor enter any hex?** No. Only along primary and secondary roads.
- **Does a hero protect against infiltration fire?** No. Infiltration is resolved before attack; hero benefits apply only during attack.
- **Can a unit infiltrate past two German positions?** Yes. Draw one card; if unit’s target symbol and either position color appear, lose a step.
- **Can a disrupted unit be disrupted again?** No. Multiple disruptions have no additional effect.
