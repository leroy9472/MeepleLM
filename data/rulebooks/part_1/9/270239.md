# Moonrakers: Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Moonrakers is a game of shipbuilding, temporary alliances, and shrewd negotiation set in a space-faring future. Players take on the roles of mercenary captains forming a loose band known as the Moonrakers. While united in name, actual alliances are fragile, as each player competes to become the new leader of the Moonrakers.

**Objective**: The first player to reach 10 Prestige at the end of any player’s turn wins the game. If two players reach 10 Prestige simultaneously, the winner is determined by the highest net worth (sum of Ship Parts, Crew, and Credits).

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Planning Phase
The Mission Leader chooses:
- **Option 1: Choose a Contract**
  - Select any face-up Contract from Dispatch Board.
  - May pay 1 Credit to replace one available Contract (once per turn).
  - May attempt solo or invite Allies.
  - Negotiate with potential Allies:
    - Distribution of Prestige, Credits, Bonus Cards
    - Assignment of Hazard Dice
  - May negotiate for up to two Contracts per turn. If no agreement on both, must solo the second or Stay at Base.

- **Option 2: Stay at Base**
  - Draw 2 Objective cards, keep 1, discard other.
  - Gain 1 Credit.
  - Optionally replace one Contract.
  - Discard current hand and draw 5 new cards.
  - Skip Execution Phase; proceed to Buying Phase.

### Execution Phase
#### Roll Hazard Dice
- Each player rolls the number of Hazard Dice assigned to them.
- Each Hazard icon rolled costs 1 Prestige unless blocked.
- Shields block 1 Hazard each (only for the player who plays them).
- Negotiations are locked after dice are rolled.

#### Attempt the Contract
- Mission Leader and Allies contribute Action Cards to meet Contract requirements.
- Requirements are shown as icons (e.g., 2 Thruster, 1 Crew).
- Mission Leader controls play order among Allies.
- Players begin with 1 Action. Reactor cards grant +2 Actions when played.
- Players may play cards until out of Actions or cards.

#### Playing Action Cards
- **Reactor**: +2 Actions, fulfills 1 Reactor requirement.
- **Thruster**: Draw 2 cards, fulfills 1 Thruster requirement.
- **Shield**: Blocks 1 Hazard, fulfills 1 Shield requirement.
- **Damage**: Fulfills Damage requirement (level I, II, III = value 1, 2, 3).
- **Miss**: No effect; only used by special abilities.
- **Crew**: Contributes to Crew requirement; has special ability when played.

#### Completing a Contract

  - Collect negotiated rewards:
    - Prestige: immediately added to tracker.

    - Bonus Card: draw top card from Crew or Ship Part deck (may discard if unwanted).
  - Players may continue playing cards (e.g., extra Shields).
- **Failure**: Requirements not met.
  - No rewards.
  - Unblocked Hazards still reduce Prestige.

#### End of Execution Phase
- All players subtract unblocked Hazards from Prestige (minimum 0).
- All players discard all played and unplayed cards.
- Allies draw 5 new cards.
- Contract is discarded; replace with new one from deck.
