## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In 1325, the Mexica (Aztecs) founded Tenochtitlan on Lake Texcoco, guided by prophecy. Players take on the role of Pilli Mexico—noble leaders—tasked with constructing districts (calpulli), building temples, and earning prestige from the Emperor. The goal is to gain the most prestige points (VP) by founding districts, having the greatest spiritual influence (via temple levels), and positioning your noble wisely during scoring phases.

2. Components  
- 1 Gameboard (representing the island of Tenochtitlan)  
- 15 Calpulli (District) Tokens (numbered 3–13; indicate district size and VP values)  
- 72 Temples (18 per player in 4 colors: 3x1-level, 3x2-level, 2x3-level, 1x4-level per player)  
- 4 Pilli Mexico Pawns (noble markers)  
- 4 Player Aids (Side A: temple counts; Side B: action costs)  
- 43 Canal Tiles (6 single-space, 37 double-space)  
- 11 Wooden Bridges  
- 12 Action Point (AP) Tokens  
- 4 Prestige Track Markers (VP cubes)  
- Rulebook

3. Setup  
- Place board in center. Position 2 double-space canal tiles on pre-printed canal spaces.  
- Shuffle 15 calpulli tokens face-down. Reveal 8 at random, place them in the Emperor’s Command area in ascending order by yellow number. Set remaining 7 aside.  
- Place all canal tiles, bridges, and AP tokens near the board.  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 1 Pilli Mexico pawn  
  - 18 temples (3x1, 3x2, 2x3, 1x4)  
  - 1 VP marker (place on 0 of track)  
  - 1 Player Aid  
- From their temples, each player takes 9 for Period 1: 3x1, 3x2, 2x3, 1x4. Set remaining 9 aside.  
- Flip Player Aid to Side B (actions).  
- Oldest player starts. Clockwise, each places their Pilli Mexico on one of the 4 starting spaces around the Emperor’s Palace (center space is impassable; no pieces may be placed on palace spaces).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of two periods, each ending when:  
- All available calpulli tokens for that period are placed (or discarded), and  
- At least one player has placed all temples available to them.  
After each period, scoring occurs. All players finish the current round (equal turns) before scoring.

**Period 1**  
- Players use 9 temples.  
- Ends after 8 calpulli tokens are used and ≥1 player has placed all 9 temples.  
- Perform intermediate scoring.

**Period 2**  
- Players take remaining 9 temples (plus any unused from Period 1).  
- Remaining 7 calpulli tokens are placed in Emperor’s Command area, sorted by yellow number.  
- Game ends after all 7 tokens are used (or discarded) and ≥1 player has placed all temples.  
- Perform final scoring.

5. Core Mechanics  
Each turn, a player has **6 Action Points (AP)** to spend. Unused AP are lost. Actions may be taken in any order, multiple times, as long as AP allow.

**Available Actions**  
- **Construct Canal (1 AP):** Place 1 or 2-space canal tile on empty land. Cannot be placed:  
  - On palace, lake, another canal, bridge base, or founded district  
  - In a way that blocks bridge access  
  - Canals may touch diagonally to close a district  
- **Found a District (0 AP):** Place a calpulli token matching the size of a water-enclosed district. Requirements:  
  - Matching token must be available  
  - Your Pilli Mexico must be in the district  
  - Token is placed on any empty land space (not palace)  
  - Once placed, token is fixed; space is blocked  
  - Founder scores blue VP; others in district score white VP  
- **Construct or Relocate Bridge (1 AP):**  
  - Construct: Place bridge on canal tile; both ends must touch land (occupied or empty)  
  - Relocate: Only after all 11 bridges are placed; bridge must be unoccupied  
  - Bridges cannot be adjacent (must have ≥1 land space between)  
- **Move Pilli Mexico (1 or 5 AP):**  
  - On Foot (1 AP per space): Move orthogonally to adjacent empty land or bridge  
    - Cannot pass through or stop on temples, tokens, or other nobles  
    - May remain on bridge  
  - By Boat (1 AP): Move from one bridge to another via connected canals/lake  
    - Path must be uninterrupted; diagonal canals not connected  
    - May pass under occupied bridge (costs 1 AP to continue)  
    - Must stop on empty bridge  
  - Teleport (5 AP): Move to any empty land or bridge space  
- **Build Temple (1–4 AP):**  
  - Cost = number of levels (engraved on temple)  
  - Must be in a district (founded or not) where your Pilli Mexico is present  
  - Cannot be built on palace or water  
  - Only one temple per space; once built, permanent  
  - Can block bridge access or trap opponent (except in first round)  
- **Take AP Token (1 AP per token, max 2/turn):** Gain 1 AP token (usable later)  
- **Spend AP Token (0 AP):** Return any number to supply to gain 1 AP each  

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Intermediate Scoring (End of Period 1)**  
For each **founded** district:  
- Sum temple levels per player in that district (spiritual grandeur)  
- Highest: scores yellow number on token  
- Second: blue number  
- Third: white number  
- Ties: All tied players get full points; next lower place(s) skipped  
- Any player with Pilli Mexico on a starting palace space: +5 VP  
- Flip scored tokens face-down, then flip back up after scoring  

**Final Scoring (End of Period 2)**  
Same as intermediate scoring for **all founded districts** (including those scored before).  
Additionally, score **unfounded districts**:  
- Highest spiritual grandeur: VP = number of spaces in district  
- Second: VP = half number of spaces (round up)  
- Third: VP = half of second-place VP (round up)  
- Ties resolved as above  
- +5 VP for Pilli Mexico on starting palace space  

**Winning**  
- Highest VP wins  
- Tie: Player with most remaining AP tokens wins  
- Still tied: All tied players win  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you found a district you didn’t build?** Yes, as long as your noble is present and token matches size.  
- **Can you place a canal in a district being founded this turn?** No—once a district is founded, no canals may be added.  
- **Can you move through a bridge occupied by another noble?** On foot: No. By boat: Yes, but cannot stop.  
- **Can you build a temple on a bridge access space?** Yes, but it blocks bridge access.  
- **Can you teleport to a space that will be freed later in the turn?** No—destination must be empty at time of action.  
- **What if a calpulli token cannot be used?** Players may agree to discard it; game continues.  
- **First round restriction:** Cannot trap an opponent’s noble with temples/canals on first round.
