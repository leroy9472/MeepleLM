## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Carcassonne: The Castle is a tile-placement strategy game where players build a medieval city by placing tiles and deploying followers (meeples) to claim features such as paths, houses, towers, and courtyards. The goal is to score the most points during and at the end of the game through completed features, strategic follower placement, and special scoring tiles known as wall tiles.

The game ends when the last tile is placed. Final scoring determines the winner.

### 2. Components  
- Castle tiles (featuring paths, houses, towers, courtyards, and markets)  
- Scoring track with corner spaces for wall tiles  
- Wall tiles (special scoring modifiers)  
- Followers (meeples) in player colors (7 per player)  
- Keep markers (1 per player)  
- Score markers (to track points on scoring track)

*For 3–6 players:* Additional followers (7 per player) and keep markers are required. Components from Carcassonne (e.g., barns, meeples) can be used.

### 3. Setup  
1. Construct the scoring track/board with corner spaces.  
2. Place wall tiles on designated corner spaces of the scoring track:
   - **2 players:** One wall tile face-down on each corner space (except the 0/1 space).
   - **3 players:** Stack two wall tiles each on the first nine corner towers (starting at 12/13); last four spaces empty.
   - **4 players:** Three tiles on first two towers (12/13), two tiles each on next six (20/21); last five empty.
   - **5 players:** Four tiles on first two (12/13), three on next two (20/21), two on next two (32/33); last seven empty.
   - **6 players:** Five tiles on first two (12/13), four on next two (20/21); last nine empty.
3. Each player takes 7 followers and 1 keep marker.
4. Place one follower on the 0 space of the scoring track.
5. Place all castle tiles in a bag.
6. Randomly determine the starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, follow these steps in order:

1. **Draw and Place a Tile**  
   - Draw a castle tile from the bag.  
   - Place it adjacent to a starting space (use these first) or an existing tile.  
   - Paths must connect to paths; buildings (houses, towers, courtyards) do not need to align.  
   - A path may end at a castle wall.  
   - If no legal placement exists, discard the tile and draw another. Repeat until a tile can be placed.

2. **Place a Follower (Optional)**  
   - Optionally place 1 follower from your supply on the newly placed tile.  
   - Choose exactly one feature: Path, House, Tower, or Courtyard.  
   - You may not place a follower on a feature already occupied by any player’s follower (even if unconnected at the time).  
   - Followers placed on courtyards cannot be removed until final scoring.

3. **Score Completed Features (Optional)**  
   After placement, check for any completed features. Only the player with the majority of followers on a feature scores:
   - **Path:** Closed (no open ends). Score 1 point per tile (2 points per tile if any tile in the path has a fountain).  
   - **House:** Completely surrounded by other features (not necessarily claimed ones). Score 1 point per tile. The scoring player places their keep marker on the house **if** it is the largest house they have scored so far.  
   - **Tower:** Completely surrounded by other features. Score 2 points per tile.  
   - **Courtyard:** Not scored during the game.  
   - If multiple features are completed, the active player chooses the order of scoring.  
   - Return all followers from scored features to their owners’ supplies.  
   - If your score marker lands exactly on a space with a wall tile, take that tile into your possession.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Tile Placement Rules:**  
  - Must be adjacent to a start space or existing tile.  
  - Path continuity required; buildings may abut freely.  
  - Illegal tiles are discarded and replaced.

- **Follower Placement:**  
  - Only one per turn, only on the placed tile.  
  - Must specify feature type.  
  - No double occupation—even ties block placement.

- **Scoring Triggers:**  
  - Features score immediately when completed.  
  - Majority wins; ties mean no one scores (except in 3–6 player games — see Rule Changes).  
  - Active player resolves multiple scoring events in preferred order.

- **Wall Tiles:**  
  - Acquired when your score marker lands exactly on a corner space containing one.  
  - Can be used during the game or at game end.  
  - Descriptions include:
    - Score 2 pts/tile for 1 uncompleted tower (endgame)  
    - Double score of 1 completed tower (each tile = 4 pts)  
    - Score 1 pt/tile for 1 uncompleted house (endgame)  
    - Double score of 1 completed house (each tile = 2 pts)  
    - Score 4 pts per market in 1 courtyard (endgame)  
    - Score 1 pt/tile (2 with fountain) for 1 uncompleted path (endgame)  
    - Enlarge your keep by 2 tiles (e.g., count a 5-tile keep as 7)  
    - Score 5 points (endgame)  
    - Take another complete turn (during game)  
  - To use wall tiles 2–7: You must have **more followers** on the relevant feature than your opponent.

- **3–6 Player Rules (Variant):**  
  - When landing on a stack of wall tiles, take one and return the rest to the space (others may claim later).  
  - Ties in feature control: All tied players score full points.  
  - Ties for largest keep: All tied players get full bonus.  
  - Wall tile benefits apply only to the player using them.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End:**  
- The game ends when the last castle tile is drawn and placed (if possible).  
- Final scoring occurs after all tiles are placed.

**Final Scoring Steps:**  
1. Remove all remaining wall tiles from the scoring track (they cannot be claimed now).  
2. Score remaining wall tiles in players’ possession.  
3. **Unfinished Features:**  
   - Paths, Houses, Towers: Not scored **unless** a wall tile allows it.  
   - Courtyards: Score 3 points per market (or 4 points per market if a wall tile grants this bonus).  
4. **Largest Keep Bonus:**  
   - Determine the player with the largest keep (based on keep markers).  
   - That player scores 1 point per tile in the largest connected area of empty spaces on the board.  
   - In case of tie: all tied players receive the full bonus.  
5. Add all points. Highest total wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a follower on a feature that will later connect to an occupied one?**  
  Yes, as long as at the time of placement, the feature is not already occupied.

- **What happens if I complete multiple features in one turn?**  
  You choose the order in which they are scored.

- **Do followers on courtyards ever come back?**  
  No. Courtyard followers remain until final scoring.

- **Can I use more than one wall tile?**  
  Yes, if you have multiple, you may use all applicable ones.

- **Can I score a feature I don’t have a follower on?**  
  No. You must have at least one follower, and the most followers, to score.

- **What if my score lands on a space with multiple wall tiles (3–6 players)?**  
  You take one tile of your choice and return the others to the space for future claims.

- **Are wall tiles used before or after other final scoring?**  
  Wall tile effects are applied during final scoring, as part of their designated use (e.g., scoring incomplete paths).
