### 1. Lore & Objective
Empire of the Sun simulates the Pacific Theater of World War II from 1941 to 1945. Players control either the Allied or Japanese forces, competing for strategic dominance. Victory is determined through a combination of political will, territorial control, and campaign-specific objectives.

### 2. Components
- Game map with hex grid
- Strategy cards (Allied and Japanese decks)
- Unit counters (Ground, Air, Naval, HQ)
- Control markers
- Supply and reinforcement track
- Amphibious Shipping Points (ASP) markers
- Future Offensive card marker
- US Political Will track
- Turn track
- China Offensive track
- India Status track
- Die

### 3. Setup
- Place the map and tracks.
- Each player receives starting units and places them according to scenario rules.
- Shuffle respective card decks and deal initial hands based on scenario.
- Set turn marker to Turn 1.
- Position control markers (e.g., Burma Road, HUMP, Inter-Service Rivalry) as per starting conditions.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Reinforcement Placement
- Allied player places reinforcements first, then Japanese.
- Ground/Naval units must be placed in friendly Port; Air units in friendly Airfield.
- All units must be in supply, not in un-neutralized enemy ZOI, and within activation range of an eligible HQ.
- HQs must be placed in a friendly Port where they are in supply.
- Chinese units must be placed in Kunming.
- If the Burma Road is open, Allied Air units can be placed in the China box.
- Units that cannot be placed go to Delayed Reinforcements box.

#### Delayed Reinforcements
- Units delayed due to War in Europe (WIE) or Inter-Service Rivalry (ISR).
- Only US Army & Air units and CVEs roll for "Divert to Europe."
- Roll 1D10 + modifier (-1 if ISR in effect); if result falls in WIE level range, unit is delayed 3 turns.
- HQs and B-29s are never delayed.

#### Replacement Rules
- Allied player uses replacements first.
- Replacements restore reduced units to full strength or bring eliminated units back at reduced strength.
- Reduced units must be in supply and not in un-neutralized enemy ZOI.
- Eliminated units return under same placement rules as reinforcements.
- Allied receives bonus replacement point for controlling Oahu.

#### Initiative Determination
- Player with more cards goes first.
- Player with fewer cards may play Future Offensives card as EC to go first.
- If tied: Japanese goes first in 1941–1942; Allied goes first in 1943–1945.
- Future Offensives cannot be used to go first when tied.

#### Offensives Execution
- Player plays card as OC (Operations) or EC (Event).
- Activates units via an in-supply HQ.
- Number of units activated = HQ Efficiency + OC value (or EC Logistics value).
- Movement:
  - Naval: 5 MP × OC value
  - Ground: 1 MP × OC value
  - Air: 1 leg × OC value (each leg ≤ extended range)
- Strategic Movement doubles movement but cannot enter battle or un-neutralized ZOI.
- Amphibious Assault requires ASP expenditure and avoids un-neutralized ZOI.
- Declare battle hexes:
  - OC: only 1 battle hex allowed
  - EC: unlimited battle hexes

#### Zone of Influence (ZOI)
- In-supply Air and Carrier units project 2-hex ZOI.
- Enemy non-LRB Air or Carrier units neutralize ZOI in same hex.
- LRB units project ZOI but do not neutralize enemy ZOI.
- Un-neutralized ZOI blocks:
  - Strategic movement
  - Amphibious Assault
  - Supply paths across sea hexsides
  - Activation paths across sea hexsides

#### Reaction Phase
- Intelligence Condition defaults to "Surprise."
- Reaction player may:
  - Play Reaction card to change to "Intercept" or "Ambush"
  - Make intelligence roll (vs. OC/EC value): success = "Intercept"
    - -2 DRM if OP units entered/exited Reaction ZOI
    - Unmodified 9 always fails
- If not "Surprise," Reaction player may activate units using in-supply HQ within range of any battle hex.
- Reaction activation limit = HQ Efficiency + OC value (or Reaction card Logistics value)
- Only 1 ASP may be used during Reaction.

#### Combat
**Air-Naval Combat**
- Resolve before Ground Combat.
- Simultaneous if "Intercept," OP first if "Surprise," RP first if "Ambush."
- Total attack strength includes:
  - Units in battle hex
  - Activated Air/CV units within range
- Air units at extended range halve attack value.
- Hits applied:
  - Full strength units must be reduced before any can be eliminated (unless critical hit)
  - Non-Carrier escorts with Carrier in battle take losses
  - Hits on out-of-hex Air/CV require matching in-hex unit
  - Critical hit (unmodified 9): can eliminate weakest eligible unit even if insufficient hits
- Winner: higher remaining attack strength; RP wins ties unless both sides eliminated

**Ground Combat**
- Always simultaneous.
- Total attack strength = sum of all Ground units in hex.
- Modifiers:
  - OP: +2 if only side with Naval or activated Air units
  - OP: terrain penalties (-1 Jungle, -2 Mixed, -3 Mountain)
  - RP: +3 if OP used Amphibious Assault and RP units were present
- Amphibious Assault units have halved defense strength
- Intrinsic units (China/Japanese Home Islands) are last eliminated
- Winner: side with fewer step losses; RP wins ties

#### Post-Battle Movement (PBM)
- Only activated Air/Naval units that didn’t use strategic movement.
- Must end in friendly Port (Naval) or Airfield (Air), in supply and within HQ range if possible.
- OP Ground units that lost Air-Naval combat after amphibious assault must retreat by sea.
- Reaction PBM first, then Offensive PBM.
- Overstacking resolved after PBM:
  - Remove excess units (air first if mixed)
  - In-supply units go to Turn Track (Naval: next turn; Air/Ground: two turns later)
  - Out-of-supply units eliminated

#### Attrition Phase
- Flip full-strength units out of supply to reduced.
- Eliminate reduced units out of supply and out of range of any HQ.
- Enemy ZOI and units do not block HQ range check.
- Naval units unaffected.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Victory Conditions (Campaign Game):**
- Allied wins immediately if:
  - Japan surrenders (Honshu conquered)
  - Japanese Home Islands blockaded for 3 consecutive turns (no supply to Resource hex)
- Japanese wins immediately if:
  - US Political Will reaches 0
- If no immediate win by Turn 12:
  - Allied wins if Japan has ≤1 Resource hex, has been strategically bombed 4 consecutive turns, and B-29 is in range of Tokyo
  - Otherwise, Japanese wins

**Progress of War (Turns ≥4):**
- Allies must capture and hold number of named locations equal to min(4, ASP available)
- Failure reduces US Political Will by 1

**US Political Will Adjustments:**
- Reduce for Allied nation surrenders (Australia, China, India: -2; others: -1)
- Reduce for continuous occupation of Alaska (-1 after 3 turns) or Hawaii (-1 after 2 turns)
- Increase by 1 per successful Strategic Bombing
- Reduce by 1 if all attacking US Ground units eliminated in single battle
- Reduce by 1 if no US Carriers on map; further reduce by 1 if no US Naval units

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Special Reaction:** Can be attempted even without declared battle hex. Requires amphibious assault into unoccupied named location (Port, Airfield, City, Resource) within range of Reaction HQ and in Reaction ZOI. Roll 1D10 - 2 ≤ OC/EC value (separate roll per hex; unmodified 9 fails).
- **HQ Activation Range:** ZOI does not affect range for Reaction HQ eligibility.
- **Air Movement:** Units with () extended range cannot enter battle if any leg was 3+ hexes.
- **Amphibious Assault Restrictions:**
  - Indian Commonwealth units cannot use amphibious or sea movement
  - US Army units need Marine unit to invade occupied 1-hex island
  - Path cannot pass through hex with enemy naval unit unless escorted
- **Inter-Service Rivalry:**
  - US: delays US Army units, -1 to Europe rolls, prevents HQ from activating both Army and Navy units
  - Japan: halves ASP, prevents HQ from activating both Army and Navy units
- **China Box:** Holds up to 2 Allied Air units (only 1 B-29). Units are in supply if Burma Road open or HUMP active and Northern India airfield is supply-eligible.
- **Emergency Movement:** Inactive units in enemy-controlled hexes move:
  - Naval: to nearest friendly Port within 10 hexes
  - Air: to nearest friendly Airfield within range
  - No elimination due to ZOI
- **Stacking Limits:** 6 Naval, 3 Ground/Air per hex. After combat, excess in-supply units go to Turn Track (Naval: next turn; Air/Ground: two turns later).
