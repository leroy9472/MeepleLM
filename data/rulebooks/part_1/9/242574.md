## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Century: Eastern Wonders – Solo*, you are a merchant privateer in the 16th century, sailing the Spice Islands of Indonesia, trading ginger, chili, tea, and cloves. Your goal is to earn victory points (VP) by claiming valuable VP tiles at ports, building outposts, and upgrading your cargo. The game ends when either you or the AI opponent collects their 4th VP tile. The player with the most VP at the end wins.

### 2. Components  
- Market tiles (with ginger, chili, tea, cloves)  
- Sea tiles  
- Port tiles (4, placed at corners)  
- VP tiles (including one Closed Port tile)  
- Bonus tiles (3VP, 4VP, 5VP, 6VP; one of each type)  
- Player boards (Eastern Wonders side)  
- Colored boats and outposts (20 per player)  
- Resource cubes (yellow, red, green, brown)  
- AI opponent: 20 outposts (use a second color)

### 3. Setup  
a. **Map Construction**:  
   - Remove 1 random market tile of each trade symbol (ginger, chili, tea, cloves).  
   - Shuffle remaining market tiles and 4 sea tiles.  
   - Build a connected map where each tile touches at least two others if possible.  
   - Place 4 port tiles at the corners of the map.  

b. **VP Tiles**:  
   - Shuffle all VP tiles except the Closed Port tile.  
   - Place 1 random VP tile face-up on each port.  
   - Shuffle the Closed Port tile into the top 5 cards of the VP deck and place the deck next to the map.  

c. **Bonus Tiles**:  
   - Sort bonus tiles by type.  
   - Form one pile per type with 3VP on bottom, ascending to 6VP on top.  
   - Set aside the 6VP bonus tile — it can only be claimed last.  
   - Use only one of each bonus tile type (total 4).  

d. **Player Setup**:  
   - Choose your player color; set up your player board with 20 outposts on the grid.  
   - Choose a second color for the AI; place its 20 outposts in a pile nearby.  
   - Randomly determine your starting cubes: draw one cube of each color and randomly pick one.  

e. **Starting Position**:  
   - In reverse turn order, players (you) choose starting cubes from available options and place their boat on any market tile.  
   - Return unused starting cube sets to the supply.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round, players take turns clockwise. On your turn:  
1. **Move** your boat (optional).  
2. **Take one action**: Market, Port, or Harvest.  
3. **AI Reaction**: After your action, the AI performs one response action.  
4. **Discard Down**: If cargo exceeds capacity (starts at 10), discard excess.

#### Movement Rules  
- Move 1 tile for free.  
- For each additional tile, leave 1 cube on each tile exited.  
- If ending on a tile with other boats, pay 1 cube to each boat’s owner. Cannot move if unable to pay.  
- If the tile has cubes, collect them after paying other players.

#### Player Actions  
- **Market (on market tile)**:  
  - Build an outpost if none present.  
    - Cost: 1 cube per existing outpost on tile (2 in 2-player game). First outpost is free.  
    - Take leftmost outpost from matching row on your board.  
    - If a column is emptied, gain a bonus tile (or merchant card in hybrid versions, not applicable here).  
  - Trade: Exchange cubes as shown on the market tile (e.g., 3 yellow → 1 red), any number of times.  

- **Port (on port tile)**:  
  - Pay the required cubes to claim the displayed VP tile.  
  - Keep VP tile face-down.  
  - Refill the port with the next VP tile from the deck.  
  - If the Closed Port tile is revealed, move it to this port and refill the vacated port.  

- **Harvest (any tile)**:  
  - Gain 2 yellow cubes from the supply.  
  - If you have the "Gain 1 red when Harvest" bonus, also gain 1 red cube.

#### AI Behavior  
After your action, the AI performs **one** action in this priority order:  
- If you took a **Port** action:  
  1. If AI has required cubes, complete an order on any VP tile in a port.  
  2. Else, perform a **Harvest** action (gain 2 yellow cubes).  
- If you took a **Market** or **Harvest** action:  
  1. If AI has required cubes, complete an order on any VP tile in a port.  
  2. Else, if AI has no outpost on the tile you acted on, place one (no cost specified — assume free placement).  
  3. AI gains the result of the trade (e.g., if you traded, AI gets same trade benefit).  
  4. AI has no cube limit.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Cube Upgrading**: Trade lower-level cubes for higher:  
  Yellow → Red → Green → Brown  
  Done via market trades or card effects.  
- **Cargo Limit**: Starts at 10. Discard down at end of turn if exceeded.  
- **Bonus Tiles**: Provide ongoing abilities:  
  - Move +1 tile free  
  - Upgrade 1 cube when building outpost (+2VP)  
  - Gain 1 red when Harvest (+1VP)  
  - +3 cargo space  
- **Closed Port Mechanic**:  
  - When a port is closed, no VP tiles are placed there.  
  - When a VP is claimed elsewhere, move the Closed Port tile to that port and refill the original.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End**: Triggered immediately after **any player (you or AI)** claims their **4th VP tile**. The current round finishes; then scoring occurs.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - VP tiles collected  
  - Bonus tiles with VP values (3, 4, 5, or 6)  
  - Uncovered spaces on player board (value shown)  
  - 1 VP per non-yellow cube in cargo (red, green, brown)  
- **Tiebreaker**: The last player to take a turn wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can the AI claim the 6VP bonus tile?**  
  No — only you can claim bonus tiles, and only one per type. The 6VP is restricted to last claim.  
- **Does the AI build outposts normally?**  
  AI only places an outpost if you perform Market/Harvest and it has no outpost on that tile. No cost is paid.  
- **Can the AI perform trades?**  
  Yes — if you perform Market or Harvest, AI gains the trade result (same as you).  
- **What if the VP deck runs out?**  
  The rules assume the deck is sufficient. Closed Port is seeded early; no reshuffling mentioned.  
- **Can I move zero tiles?**  
  Yes — movement is optional.  
- **Do I collect cubes on a tile before or after paying other players?**  
  After — pay first, then collect cubes.
