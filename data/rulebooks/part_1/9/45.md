## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Liar’s Dice is a game of bluffing, prediction, and risk assessment. Players compete to be the last one with dice remaining by making increasingly bold predictions about the total number of dice showing a specific value across all players’ hidden rolls. The game challenges players to balance statistical reasoning with deception.  

**Objective**: Be the last player with at least one die in play.

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board (featuring a circular bidding track with numbered and wild (star/ship's wheel) spaces)  
- 31 dice (yellow or white, five per player at start; one face is a wild symbol: ship's wheel or star instead of "1")  
- 6 folding dice cups (or dice cones)  
- 1 red die (used as the prediction die to mark bids on the board)  

*Note: For 2–4 players, only 20 dice are used; for 5–6 players, up to 30 dice are used. Extra dice are set aside.*

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center of the table.  
2. Place the red die (prediction die) near the "1" space on the board.  
3. Each player receives:  
   - 1 dice cup  
   - 5 dice  
4. Determine starting player:  
   - All players roll all 5 of their dice.  
   - The player with the most **ship's wheel** (or star/wild) symbols starts.  
   - Tiebreaker: Among tied players, the one with the highest sum of non-wild dice wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game consists of multiple rounds. A round ends when a bid is challenged and resolved. Play proceeds as follows:

1. **Roll**: All players roll their dice in their cups and keep them hidden.  
2. **Opening Bid**: The starting player makes the first bid using the red die on the board.  
3. **Turn Order**: Play proceeds clockwise. Each player must either:  
   - **Raise the bid**, or  
   - **Challenge** the current bid.  
4. **Challenge**: When a player challenges, all dice are revealed, the bid is evaluated, and penalties are applied.  
5. **New Round**: After resolution, players reroll remaining dice. The **challenger** (if still in game) starts the next round. If eliminated, the next player clockwise begins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Dice Faces  
- Each die has faces: **2, 3, 4, 5, 6**, and a **wild symbol** (ship's wheel or star).  
- The wild symbol counts as **any number** (2–6) when evaluating bids.  
- There is **no "1"**—the wild symbol replaces it.

#### Bidding  
Players use the red die to mark bids on the circular bidding track. There are two types of bids:

- **Number Bid**: Predicts at least X dice showing a specific number (including wilds).  
  - Place red die on an **unstarred** space with the number face up.  
  - Example: Red die on "5" space with "4" face up = "At least five 4s" (including wilds).  

- **Wild Star Bid**: Predicts at least X **wild symbols** (only).  
  - Place red die on a **starred** space with the star face up.  
  - Example: Red die on "4" starred space with star up = "At least four wilds."

#### Raising the Bid  
A new bid must be **higher** than the previous. You may:  
- **Increase quantity only**: Move red die to a higher-numbered space (clockwise), any number/star.  
- **Increase value only**: Keep red die on same space, show a higher number (e.g., 3 → 5).  
- **Increase both**: Move to a higher space and change number/star.  
- **From Wild Star space**: You **must** increase quantity (move clockwise); you cannot stay or raise value only.  
- **To Wild Star space**: You may move to any higher starred space with star face up.

#### Challenging the Bid  
On your turn, you may challenge instead of raising. Say “Challenge” or “Call.”  
- All players reveal their dice.  
- Count dice matching the bid:  
  - For **Number Bid**: All dice showing the bid number **plus all wilds**.  
  - For **Wild Star Bid**: Only wild symbols count.  
- Compare actual count to bid quantity:

| Outcome | Penalty |
|--------|---------|
| **Actual < Bid** | Bidder was wrong → Bidder loses **(Bid – Actual)** dice |
| **Actual ≥ Bid** | Challenger was wrong → Challenger loses **(Bid – Actual)** dice |
| **Actual = Bid** | “Perfect Bid” → **All players except bidder** lose **1 die** |

*Exception*: Under “Final Die / Die Hard” rule (see below), a player **cannot lose their last die** in a perfect bid unless they were the challenger.

#### Losing Dice  
- Lost dice are placed on the **Lost Dice Squares** (or in a bag, per variant).  
- If a player loses all dice, they are **eliminated**.  
- Game continues until one player remains.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is **no scoring**; the game ends when only **one player has dice left**.  
- That player **wins**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

#### Q: Can I bid a number I don’t have?  
A: Yes. Bluffing is encouraged. You may bid any number, even if you have none.

#### Q: Do wilds count in every bid?  
A: Yes. For **Number Bids**, wilds count as the bid number. For **Wild Star Bids**, only wilds count.

#### Q: Who starts the next round?  
A: The **player who made the challenge** starts the next round. If they were eliminated, the next player clockwise does.

#### Q: What is the “Show and Reroll” rule?  
A: Immediately after making a bid, you may:  
- Reveal **one or more** of your dice outside your cup (they stay visible for the round).  
- Reroll your **remaining dice** (must have at least one to reroll).  
- The revealed dice still count toward the bid if they match.  
- This can improve your odds if challenged.

#### Q: What is the “Final Die / Die Hard” rule?  
A: If a **perfect bid** is challenged and correct, all players except the bidder lose 1 die—but **any player with only one die** (and who did **not** make the challenge) **keeps it**. Only the **challenger** loses their last die in this case.

#### Q: Can I make a Wild Star bid first?  
A: Yes. Unlike some variants (e.g., Perudo), **Wild Star bids are allowed as opening bids**.

#### Q: Are there special rules when only two players remain?  
A: No palafico-style rules apply. Normal bidding and wild rules continue.

#### Q: Can I pass?  
A: No. You must either **raise** or **challenge**.
