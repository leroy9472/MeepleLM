### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Player Actions
1. **Develop Show**:
   - Pay Development Cost and meet prerequisites (icons on Show Card).
   - Take a face-up Show from the Scoring Track.
   - Cancel a show in a time slot: move to Rerun area (rotated 180°), discard attached Stars/Ads (starter cards to box).
   - Place new Show in vacant slot. Attach required Stars/Ads from Green Room.
   - Place Scoring Cube on top Viewer row (always, regardless of season).
   - If Show is in preferred time slot and in first season, score higher Viewer value.
   - May cancel a Show in the same season it was developed, but only by replacing it.

2. **Sign Star**:
   - Take a face-up Star from Scoring Track.
   - Pay Signing Cost.
   - Place in Green Room (not on a Show).
   - No replacement card drawn.

3. **Land Ad**:
   - Take a face-up Ad from Scoring Track.
   - Collect Landing Bonus (immediate income).
   - Place in Green Room.
   - No replacement card drawn.
   - **Promos**: Ads that give Viewers; require payment when attached or rotate to gray side.

4. **Take Network Card**:
   - Take a face-up Network Card.
   - No cost.
   - 4 Types:
     - **Instant Use**: Use power, discard to bottom.
     - **One-Time Use**: Keep, use once during game, then discard.
     - **Endgame Only**: Keep; scores at end of game.
     - **Advanced Only (lasting effect)**: Keep; may discard once for bonus, losing effect.
   - Cards in Green Room do not affect income/Viewers until used or scored.
   - If a Network Card contradicts a rule, it takes precedence.

5. **Attach Star or Ad**:
   - Attach one Star or Ad from Green Room to a Show.
   - If Show has space (per prerequisites), slide under.
   - If at capacity, discard one Star/Ad to make room.
   - Evaluate conditions at time of attachment; do not rotate later.

6. **Drop and Budget**:
   - Move Turn Order Disc to leftmost available space on Drop and Budget track.
   - Collect reward from that space:
     - Season 1: money only.
     - Seasons 2–5: choose money or Viewers.
   - End your Season (no more actions).
   - When all players drop, proceed to End of Season.

#### Burning Actions (1–2 Players Only)
- Occurs at specific points (every 3 turns in 2p; every turn in 1p unless Drop and Budget).
- Reveal top Network Card; follow Burn Icons on bottom:
  - Burn leftmost Show, Star, Ad, or Network Card (to bottom of deck).
  - Burn leftmost Drop and Budget space (block with cube).
- Discard Network Card to bottom after burn.
- In 1p, failing a burn places a cube on Turn Order track; 5 cubes = immediate loss.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End of Each Season (except after Season 5 final scoring)**:
1. **Income / Expenses**:
   - Income: from attached Ads.
   - Expenses: upkeep from Shows and Stars in Lineup (not Reruns/Archives).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **What happens if no face-up cards are available for an action?** You cannot perform that action until next Season.
- **Can Network Cards be used out of turn?** Only if the card specifies (e.g., reaction, end of turn).
