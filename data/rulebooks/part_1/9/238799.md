#### 2) Action Phase
Players act in turn order. Each turn:

   - **Rounds 5–6**: Spend 2 Fire Tokens or 1 Major Fire Token per Cube removed.  
   - Major Fire Token: Can remove 1 additional Cube from adjacent Hex (Rounds 1–4), or requires 2 Major Fire Tokens for adjacent removal (Rounds 5–6).  
   - For each Cube removed, advance 1 space on Popularity Track.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Lieutenants**: Primary action enablers. Can be moved, recalled (gain 1 Coin), or used to repopulate (possibly discarded).
- **Fire Tokens**: Used to remove Plague Cubes. Cost increases in Rounds 5–6.
- **Major Fire Tokens**: More efficient; can affect adjacent Hex (Rounds 1–4) or require two for adjacent effect (Rounds 5–6).
- **Wagons**: Required for Repopulation. Flipped face down when used; flipped face up at round end.
- **Repopulate**: Converts Hex to player-controlled; grants VP at endgame, 2 VP per visit, 1 Rat per new Plague Cube.
- **Registers**:  
  - **Popularity**: Advanced by removing Plague Cubes. Grants actions, VP, and affects final scoring.  
  - **City**: Pay to advance; gain extra Lieutenants or special actions.  
  - **Church**: Pay to advance; gain Overseer upgrades and citizen activations.
- **Overseers**: Advance via Boat collection or Church Track. Grant citizen activations. Upgraded Overseers provide extra activations.
- **Scroll Board**: Tracks progress in various areas; scored at endgame.
- **Population Wheel**: Drives citizen and plague spread each round.
