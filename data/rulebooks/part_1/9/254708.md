# Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Roll Player Adventures is a cooperative storytelling board game set in the world of Ulos. After a thousand years of peace, Dragul armies invaded from the north, prompting citizens of Nalos to defend their homeland. The players take on the roles of a party of characters facing challenges that affect the unfolding story across a campaign of 11 consecutive adventures and one optional sidequest. The objective is to progress through the narrative, overcome skill checks and combat encounters, and make decisions that shape the story and character development.

### Campaign Setup  
1. Fill the dice bag with 36 attribute dice.  
2. Prepare the party journal:  
   - Record combat dice limit, play limit, and bonus play limit based on player count.  
3. Each player takes a character sheet and inserts a character insert.  
4. Players select pregenerated characters with different class colors, or import characters from Roll Player.  
5. Record character name, race, class, and starting health (16 by default).  
6. Record attribute scores from the portrait card.  
7. Fill attribute rows with stamina cubes equal to each attribute score.  
8. Place matching class card face up in class ability space.  
9. Build starting hands using cards listed on the back of portrait cards.  
10. Place starting gold on the party journal based on player count.  

### Adventure Setup  
1. Place the party journal in the center.  
2. Create a supply of components near the journal.  
3. Place discovery, title, and rare decks face down, in numerical order.  
4. Distribute character sheets and player aids.  
5. Assign storyteller (with storybook) and tome keeper (with Tome of Encounters).  
6. Follow adventure-specific setup instructions.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
- The storyteller reads entries aloud from the storybook.  
- Action indicators (!) are resolved in order; choice indicators (?) require group decisions.  
- Movement occurs via "Move to another location" choices.  
- When encountering an encounter token, the tome keeper reads the corresponding entry in the Tome of Encounters.  
- The party may use items, rest, or engage in skill checks and combat as directed.  
- Resting resets stamina and refreshes abilities when XP is available.  
- The story progresses through narrative branching based on keywords and titles.  
- At the end of an adventure, the party advances characters during Advancement.  

5. Core Mechanics  
### Keywords  
- Gained during adventures and recorded on the party journal.  
- Erased between adventures.  
- Used to trigger narrative branches.  

### Titles  
- Gained through major decisions and placed in the titles space.  
- Saved between adventures.  
- Influence story outcomes.  

### Skill Checks  
1. Set up: Open skillbook to correct page and difficulty row; assign modifiers.  
2. Build dice pool:  
   - Dice limit is defined by the skill check.  
   - Players spend stamina from matching attribute rows to add specific dice (cost = number of players).  
   - Substitute stamina from other rows at 3:1 ratio if needed.  
   - Add random dice to meet the limit.  
   - Roll the dice pool.  
3. Manipulate and place dice:  
   - Play cards to alter dice.  
   - Activate class abilities (flipping class card face down).  
   - Spend bonus play tokens to exceed play limit.  
   - Place dice on matching slots in the skillbook.  
4. Resolution:  
   - Pass if all slots are covered; fail otherwise.  
   - Gain rewards for covered slots.  
   - Return dice and cards; resolve story outcome.  

### Combat  
1. Set up: Reveal enemy card and modifiers; place round marker.  
2. Build dice pool: Same as skill checks, using combat dice limit.  
3. Manipulate and place dice: Same as skill checks.  
4. End of round:  
   - If all slots covered, victory.  
   - Otherwise, suffer counterattacks for uncovered slots.  
   - Apply round track effect and advance marker.  
   - Return dice and start next round if applicable.  
5. End of combat:  
   - Victory if all enemies are defeated.  
   - Defeat if any enemy remains and time runs out, or if entire party is exhausted.  
   - Gain rewards for covered slots.  
   - Return components and resolve outcome.  

### Multiple Enemies  
- Dice may be placed in any order.  
- Defeated enemies lose modifiers and round markers, but dice remain on their cards.  
- Victory requires defeating all enemies.  

### Resting  
- Requires at least 1 XP and the choice indicator "Rest."  
1. Place a stamina cube on the leftmost open box of the rest track.  
   - If on the fourth box or already full, one player returns a card to its deck.  
2. Spend 1+ XP.  
3. Each player draws and rolls that many dice; remove stamina from fatigue box equal to the roll.  
4. Refill all attribute rows.  
5. Flip face-down class cards face up.  
6. Return bonus play tokens to the supply.  
7. Return spent cards to hand.  

### Exhaustion  
- A player is exhausted when fatigue equals current health.  
- Exhausted players cannot play cards, use abilities, or spend stamina.  
- Revival occurs when fatigue drops below health.  
- If entire party is exhausted, follow storybook until directed to the Tome of Encounters.  

### Faction Tracks  
- Track favor with King's Favor, Starlit Door, and Dragul Favor.  
- Move markers left (lose favor) or right (gain favor).  
- If marker cannot move further, gain 1 XP per blocked space.  
- Ties: highest faction is topmost on journal; lowest is bottommost.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is no traditional scoring system.  
- Progress is measured by campaign advancement through the 11 adventures.  
- The campaign ends after Adventure 11 or the optional sidequest.  
- Success is determined by narrative outcomes and character progression.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Legendary Mode**: Mark "Legendary" on the journal and permanently mark off the first rest track box.  
  - Failing a skill check adds stamina equal to difficulty level to each player’s fatigue box (capped at one below health).  
  - Hand limit = base limit + attribute score matching class color. Excess cards are stored beneath character portrait.  
- **Depleted Decks**: If a card cannot be drawn from an empty deck, gain 2 XP instead.  
- **Trading**: Not allowed unless specified by a storybook.  
- **Partial Actions**: Perform as much as possible.  
- **Stamina Tokens**: Used only in fatigue boxes; can be exchanged as needed.  
- **Familiar Dice**: Count as two colors; value is sum of pips. When color-changed, they become a single color.  
- **Conflicting Rules**: Storybook > card text > rulebook.
