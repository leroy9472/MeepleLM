5. Core Mechanics  
a. Draft Phase:  
- Players alternate drafting 1 villager per turn.  
- Drafting Limit = 2 + 1 per Food icon in Village (max 5).  
- Draft options:  
  - Take a face-up villager from the Road.  
  - Take top card from any face-down stack.  
  - If all stacks empty, draw from Reserve.  
- If drafting a face-up villager, immediately replace it with top card from leftmost stack (or Reserve).  
- If villager has coin on it, take coin into your Supply.  
- After all players draft, update the Road:  
  - 3–5 players: Discard coin-bearing villagers, refill from Reserve, place 1 Gold on each face-up villager.  
  - 2 players: Each player may place 1 Gold on a face-up villager (reverse order), discard non-coin villagers, refill from Reserve.

b. Build Phase:  
- Build Limit = 2 + 1 per Builder icon in Village at start of phase (max 5).  
- Players declare Build Limit, place intended villagers on Village Square, then build.  
- Actions (in any order):  
  - Place villagers from hand into Village.  
  - Return a villager from hand to a stack/Reserve to take a Basic Villager (Lumberjack, Hayer, Miner). Up to 3 times per phase. Does not count toward Build Limit.  
  - Get a Team: Return two villagers to stacks/Reserve to take a Team card. Only one Team allowed. Does not count toward Basic Villager limit.  
  - Play Special Villagers:  
    - With discard symbol: Used once, discarded, does not count toward Build Limit.  
    - Without discard symbol: Placed in Village, counts toward Build Limit.  

c. Production Chains:  
- Some villagers have a chain listed (e.g., Lumberjack + Wheeler + Cartwright).  
- Must be placed in order: earlier villagers beneath later ones.  
- Cover everything below the name when stacking.  
- First card in chain (e.g., Lumberjack) can support up to 2 stacked villagers (two branches).  

d. Padlocks:  
- To play a locked villager, pay 2 Gold to unlock:  
  - If you have the Unlocking Villager: Pay 2 Gold from Bank to your villager.  
  - If another player has it: Pay 2 Gold from your Supply to their villager.  
  - If no one has it: Pay 2 Gold to Bank.  
- You may unlock using a villager played in the same Build Phase.  
- Multiple unlockers? You choose which to pay. Cannot pay Bank if another player has the unlocker.

e. Developments Phase:  
- After Build Phase, determine winner for each Development:  
  - Compare according to condition (e.g., most villagers, most Food, etc.).  
  - Tie: No one wins.  
- Winner takes Token and immediate reward:  
  - Gold from Bank.  
  - Villager from Road/stacks.  
  - Food or Builder (usable next round; max 5 still applies).  
- Development Symbols and Gold not scored later.

f. Event Phase:  
- When Event card is revealed (under stack), it triggers after Developments Phase.  
- Resolve in turn order. Multiple Events: resolve leftmost first.  
- Carry out effect (e.g., score Silver, draw cards, etc.).  
- Flip or discard after resolution.

g. Market Phase:  
- First Market Phase: Triggered when first two stacks are empty.  
  - Score: Sum of Gold Symbols on topmost villagers + coins on villagers.  
  - Silver Symbols not scored.  
  - Coins remain on villagers.  
- Second Market Phase: Triggered when all stacks are empty.  
  - Score:  
    1. Silver Symbols on topmost villagers (using full formula).  
    2. Gold Symbols on topmost villagers.  
    3. Move all coins from villagers in Village to Supply.  
  - Covered Food, Builder, Gold not scored; Suit Symbols and Padlocks are counted even if covered.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Final scoring occurs during Second Market Phase.  
- Winner: Most Gold in Supply.  
- Tie: Player with fewest villagers wins.  
- Solo vs Countess: You win if you have more Gold than Countess. Tie: Fewest villagers wins.
