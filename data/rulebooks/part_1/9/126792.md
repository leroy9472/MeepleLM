## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Myrmes*, players control ant colonies competing for dominance over a shared garden environment. Over the course of 3 in-game years (12 seasons), players expand their territory using pheromone trails, hunt prey, complete objectives, and evolve their colonies. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VP) by strategically managing workers, nurses, larvae, and resources.

The game ends after the third winter. The player with the most VP wins. In case of a tie, tied players share the victory.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A game lasts 3 years. Each year has 4 seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall (with events), and Winter (no event). Each season proceeds in 7 phases:

#### #1. Event
- Roll the event die to determine the seasonal effect.
- Players may spend **1 Larva per space** to adjust their personal event track upward (cannot go below rolled value).
- Event effects apply only to that player for the current season.

Common Events:
- **+1 Movement**: Workers get 6 movement points instead of 3.
- **+1 VP**: Gain +1 VP whenever scoring occurs.
- **+1 Level**: Can place pheromone tiles one level larger than current colony level.
- **+1 Hex**: Can place one additional hex on pheromone tiles (e.g., enables 6-hex tile at Level 3).
- **+2 Birth**: Gain +2 larvae if producing larvae this turn.
- **+3 Harvest**: After normal harvest, take up to 3 extra resources from your pheromone tiles.

#### #2. Births (Nurse Allocation)  
Players simultaneously assign nurses to one or more of the following tracks:
- **Larvae Birth**: 1st nurse → 1 larva; each additional nurse → 2 larvae.
- **Soldier Birth**: 1st two nurses → 1 soldier; 3rd nurse → second soldier.
- **Worker Birth**: Each pair of nurses → 1 new worker (max 4 workers produced per player).
- **Atelier**: Assign nurses here to perform actions in Phase 5.

After assignment, resolve all births immediately (subject to supply limits). Nurse allocations must be legal (e.g., only one nurse per worker birth space).

#### #3. Workers (Worker Actions)  
In turn order, players take turns assigning **one worker at a time** until all workers are used.

Each worker may do **one** of the following:

**A. Work in Ant Colony**  
- Place worker on an open level of your tech tree (one worker per level).
- Gain the bonus shown on that level (e.g., resource, storage upgrade).
- Worker is recovered at end of round.

**B. Sortie (Worker Leaves Nest)**  
Worker leaves via a tunnel exit and enters the garden. Movement: 3 hexes (6 if +3 Move event active).

During movement:
- Cross **own tiles** freely.
- Cross **neutral or unowned tiles** freely.
- Enter **opponent’s tile** → discard 1 Soldier.
- Move across **entire pheromone tile** = 1 movement point.
- Cannot cross water.
- May move over own colony entrance freely.

After movement, worker may perform **one** of these actions (worker is discarded after):

**i) Hunt Prey**  
- Land on a hex with prey (Ladybug, Termite, Spider).
- Discard required soldiers:
  - Ladybug: 1 Soldier → 2 Food
  - Termite: 1 Soldier → 1 Food + 2 VP
  - Spider: 2 Soldiers → 1 Food + 4 VP
- Take prey token.
- Worker may continue moving if movement points remain.

**ii) Place Pheromone Tile**  
- Place a pheromone tile centered on worker's current hex.
- Must fit entirely on board, not overlap other tiles, not cover water.
- Size limit: colony level + possible event bonuses.
- Place resource cubes on tile matching terrain under each hex (Earth, Stone, Food).
- Discard worker.
- Score VP: based on size:
  - 2 hexes: 2 VP
  - 3 hexes: 3 VP
  - 4 hexes: 4 VP
  - 5 hexes: 5 VP
  - 6 hexes: 6 VP

**iii) Place Special Tile**  
- Place one of three types:
  - **Aphid Farm**: Gain 1 Food during Harvest
  - **Scavenging**: Gain 1 Earth or 1 Stone during Harvest
  - **Sub-colony**: Gain 2 VP during Harvest
- Pay required resources (varies by tile and level).
- Place ownership cube on tile.
- Discard worker.
- Max 4 special tiles per player (due to ownership cube limit).

**iv) Remove Pheromone Tile**  
- Cross an empty pheromone tile (own or opponent’s).
- Pay 1 Earth cube.
- Remove tile (returned to box, not reserve).
- Score VP equal to size of tile removed.
  - Removing opponent’s tile gives full VP.
- Worker may continue moving.
- Cannot remove tiles with resources on them.
- Cannot remove special tiles.

#### #4. Harvest  
All players:
- Take **1 resource** from each **non-empty pheromone tile** they own.
- Harvest benefits from **special tiles**:
  - Aphid Farm → 1 Food
  - Scavenging → 1 Earth or 1 Stone
  - Sub-colony → 2 VP
- Resources go to player’s stockpile.

If +3 Harvest event active: after normal harvest, take up to 3 additional resources from any of your pheromone tiles (any type, any combination).

#### #5. Atelier  
Players take turns (starting with first player). Each nurse previously assigned to the Atelier performs **one unique action** (each action can be taken only once per player per turn):

Available actions:
- **Create New Tunnel Exit**:
  - Place new tunnel adjacent to any of your existing tiles.
  - Gain 1 Earth cube.
  - Max 4 tunnel exits per player.
- **Gain New Nurse**:
  - Pay 2 Food + 2 Larvae.
  - Take 1 Nurse from supply.
- **Upgrade Colony Level**:
  - Level 0 → 1: 2 Earth
  - Level 1 → 2: 2 Earth + 1 Stone
  - Level 2 → 3: 3 Stone
  - Cannot skip levels.
  - Only one level upgrade per turn.
- **Complete Objective**:
  - Choose an available Objective tile (Level 1 first, then 2, then 3; cannot skip levels).
  - Fulfill criteria (e.g., remove ownership cubes, pay resources, hunt prey).
  - Place nurse on objective to mark completion.
  - Score VP as shown.
  - If other players later complete the same objective, they score bonus VP (3/4/5 VP depending on player count).

#### #6. End of Season  
- Discard used larvae.
- Discard excess resource cubes:
  - Colony Level 0–1: max 4 cubes
  - Colony Level 2–3: max 6 cubes
- Return workers from Ant Colony to Worker Room.
- Return nurses from Atelier to Nurse Room **except** those used to complete objectives (they remain on objective tiles).
- Advance event marker (unless next is Winter).

#### #7. Winter  
Occurs after Fall of each year.

All players must **pay food**:
- Year 1: 4 Food
- Year 2: 5 Food
- Year 3: 6 Food

Each **soldier** reduces required payment by 1 (minimum 0).

For each unpaid food cube, lose 3 VP.

At any time during their turn, players may convert **3 Larvae → 1 Food**.

After Winter:
- Pass Start Player token to the left.
- Roll new event die for next Spring.
- Begin new year.
