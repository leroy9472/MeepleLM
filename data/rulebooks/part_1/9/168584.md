## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In this Batman-themed card game, players compete to be the last player remaining in each round by using character cards with unique abilities. The ultimate goal is to avoid being eliminated through strategic play, deduction, and timing. The game revolves around bluffing, hand management, and reacting to others’ actions.

2. Components  
- 28 cards (based on duplication and counts listed) featuring characters from the Batman universe:  
  - Batman (5 copies)  
  - Catwoman (2 copies)  
  - Robin (2 copies)  
  - Bane (2 copies)  
  - Poison Ivy (2 copies)  
  - Two-Face (1 copy)  
  - Harley Quinn (1 copy)  
  - Joker (1 copy)  
- Each card has a rank (1–8), a name, and a special ability.

3. Setup  
- Shuffle all cards thoroughly.  
- Deal one card face-down to each player.  
- Players look at their card without revealing it to others.  
- The remaining cards form a draw pile in the center.  
- Number of players: 2–4 (implied by mechanics).  
- Begin with the player to the dealer’s left, proceeding clockwise.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, you must:  
1. Draw one card from the deck.  
2. Play exactly one card from your hand (you may not pass).  
   - You may play the card you just drew.  
3. Resolve the card’s effect fully before the next player’s turn.  

After playing a card:  
- Discard it to a central discard pile.  
- If you have no cards at the end of your turn, you are out of the round.  

The round continues until only one player remains, or until the draw pile is exhausted (if so, the last player remaining wins).

5. Core Mechanics  
Each card has a unique effect based on its character:

- **#1 Batman (5 copies)**  
  Name a card *other than Batman* and select another player. If that player currently holds the named card, they are immediately out of the round.  
  - Cannot name "Batman".  
  - Must target another player.  
  - If the target does *not* have the named card, nothing happens.

- **#2 Catwoman (2 copies)**  
  Choose another player. Look at their hand.  
  - No other effect.  
  - Must target someone else.

- **#3 Bane (2 copies)**  
  Choose another player. You and that player secretly compare the cards in your hands. The player holding the lower-ranked card is out of the round.  
  - In case of a tie, no one is eliminated.  
  - Comparison is based on card number (1–8).  
  - If either player has multiple cards, only the one played matters (assumed: one-card hands typical).

- **#4 Robin (2 copies)**  
  Gain protection until your next turn. While protected, you are immune to the effects of all other cards.  
  - Prevents elimination from Batman, Bane, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, and Joker discard effects.  
  - Does not protect against forced hand trades (Two-Face).

- **#5 Poison Ivy (2 copies)**  
  Choose any one player (including yourself). That player discards their hand and draws a new card from the deck.  
  - If the deck is empty, they draw nothing.  
  - If the targeted player is eliminated as a result (e.g., had no cards), they are out.

- **#6 Two-Face (1 copy)**  
  Choose another player. You and that player swap hands entirely.  
  - Trade happens immediately and must be completed.  
  - You may target any player, even one with protection (Robin), as the trade is not an “effect” that can be blocked.

- **#7 Harley Quinn (1 copy)**  
  If you hold both Harley Quinn *and* either Two-Face or Poison Ivy in your hand, you must discard Harley Quinn immediately.  
  - Discarding Harley Quinn in this way does *not* trigger a loss.  
  - If you are forced to discard Harley Quinn (e.g., via Poison Ivy), and you are holding Two-Face or Poison Ivy, you are out.

- **#8 Joker (1 copy)**  
  If you discard the Joker for any reason (played, forced discard, etc.), you are immediately out of the round.  
  - The *only* way to survive with the Joker is to hold it until the end.  
  - Playing the Joker counts as discarding it → automatic loss.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- A round ends when:  
  - Only one player remains in the round. That player wins the round.  
  - The draw pile is empty at the start of a turn. In this case, the last player still in wins.  
- Play multiple rounds; first player to win a set number (e.g., 3 or 5) wins the game (exact target not specified).  
- If all players are eliminated simultaneously, the round has no winner.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play Robin on myself?**  
  Yes. Robin must be played on yourself. It grants you protection until your next turn.

- **What happens if I draw Harley Quinn and already have Poison Ivy?**  
  You must immediately discard Harley Quinn. If discarding it causes you to lose (e.g., you also had Two-Face or Poison Ivy), you are out.

- **Does Two-Face’s trade trigger Harley Quinn’s discard condition?**  
  Yes. If the trade results in a player holding Harley Quinn + Two-Face or Poison Ivy, they must immediately discard Harley Quinn. If discarding causes Joker discard or leaves them with no cards, they are out.

- **Can Batman name a card that’s not in the deck (e.g., a sixth Batman)?**  
  Yes, but if the target doesn’t have that card, nothing happens. Naming an invalid or nonexistent card is allowed but ineffective.

- **Does Joker count as an 8 for Bane comparisons?**  
  Yes. Card rank is numerical: Joker is #8, so it beats all others in a Bane comparison.

- **Can you play a card to eliminate yourself?**  
  Only if forced. All plays are voluntary, so self-elimination is possible only by choice (e.g., playing Joker).

- **What if the deck runs out?**  
  Players continue until someone must draw. If a player cannot draw, their turn proceeds without drawing. If they have no cards to play, they are out.
