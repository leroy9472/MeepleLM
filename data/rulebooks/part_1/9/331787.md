# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Tiny Epic Dungeons is a cooperative dungeon-crawling board game where players control heroes exploring a dark, ever-shifting dungeon to defeat a powerful boss. The game is split into two acts. In Act 1, players explore the dungeon, fight enemies, disarm traps, and defeat minions to unlock the boss’s lair. In Act 2, players engage in a final battle against the boss. The ultimate goal is to defeat the boss before the torch runs out or the dungeon becomes impassable.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **On Your Turn**:
   - Move (spend Speed to explore).
   - Perform One Heroic Action (e.g., Attack, Cast Spell, Disarm Trap).
   - Perform Any Number of Free Actions.
   - End Turn: Move Torch down one space on the track, resolving any effects.

2. **Enemy Phase**:
   - After each player’s turn, the Torch moves down.
   - If it lands on:
     - **Add a Goblin**: Place lowest-numbered Goblin token on Entrance, draw Goblin card, place in matching slot. If 5th Goblin, game over.
     - **Trigger Enemy Actions**: All enemies perform actions in order (Goblins 1–4, then Minions/Boss).
   - Enemies move toward nearest conscious hero and attack.

3. **Exploration**:
   - Reveal facedown cards by moving into adjacent spaces.
   - Rotate cards to connect pathways.
   - Place new facedown cards on open corridors (up to 7×7 grid limit).
   - Check for danger when entering:
     - **Goblin Encounter**: Take 1 damage, draw Goblin card, place token.
     - **Minion Encounter**: Take 2 damage, draw Minion card, place token and health marker.
     - **Trap**: Perform Skill Check to evade. If failed, take damage. Can attempt to disarm afterward.

4. **Heroic Actions**:
   - **Rest**: Gain 3 Health and 5 Focus. Required if unconscious.
   - **Search Room**: Perform Skill Check to activate room ability.
   - **Disarm Trap**: After evading, perform Skill Check to disarm. Success places Disarm Marker and grants 1 Loot or Spell.
   - **Cast a Spell**: Perform Skill Check. Success allows spell effect (pay Focus cost).
   - **Attack**: Perform Melee, Missile, or Spell Attack. Roll Skill Check vs enemy Defense. Deal damage = difference. Enemy may Counter-Attack.

5. **Counter-Attack**:
   - If enemy is alive and in line-of-sight, roll Enemy Die.
   - Damage = Enemy Die + modifier (based on attack type) – Hero Defense.
   - **Torch result**: Move Torch down, no damage.
   - **Shield Match**: Deal damage = modifier only.

6. **Killing Enemies**:
   - **Goblin**: Return token and card. Gain optional reward (Loot, Health, Focus, etc.).
   - **Minion**: Remove token and card. Place health marker on Boss Mat. Gain 1 Loot or Spell twice. Move Torch up 6 spaces.
   - **Boss**: See Act 2 rules.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Health & Focus**: Track damage and resource for abilities.
- **Speed**: Maximum rooms moved per turn.
- **Defense**: Reduces Counter-Attack damage.
- **Skills (Strength, Agility, Intellect)**: Determine number of Hero Dice (1–3) for Skill Checks.
- **Skill Checks**: Roll dice, use one as result. Can modify with 1 or 2 (‘+’) to increase result. Unused dice with ‘●’ grant Focus; ‘6’ grants Health.
- **Free Actions**: Can be used anytime on your turn. Examples:
  - Modify a Hero Die by 1 (cost 2 Focus).
  - Reveal adjacent rooms (cost: move Torch down).
  - Research (cost 4 Focus) to draw a Spell.
  - Enter Boss’s Lair (after all Minions dead).
- **Range**:
  - Same Room: Target in same room.
  - Line-of-Sight: Straight path, not same room.
  - Any Path: Connected by path, can be same room.
  - All Heroes/Enemies: Within range, following paths.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
