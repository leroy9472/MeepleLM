## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Wandering Towers*, wizards have delayed their gathering at Ravenskeep, distracted by magic and depleted of potions. Players help their wizards reach Ravenskeep while refilling potion bottles by imprisoning wizards under towers. The goal is to get all your wizards into Ravenskeep and fill all your potion bottles. Victory is achieved when both conditions are met.

2. Components  
- 1 Ravenskeep castle (not a tower)  
- 9 towers: 5 with raven icons, 4 without  
- 4 landscape tiles forming a circular path  
- 90 movement cards (with movement values 1–5 or die icons)  
- 30 wizard meeples (5 in each of 6 colors: blue, yellow, red, green, orange, purple)  
- 36 potion bottles (6 per color, front empty, back full)  
- 1 six-sided die  
- 1 starting player token (raven shield)  
- 8 magic spell tokens:  
  - Advance a Wizard  
  - Advance a Tower  
  - Headwind for a Wizard  
  - Headwind for a Tower  
  - Fill a Magic Potion Flask  
  - Swap a Tower  
  - Retrieve a Card  
  - Draw2Cards  
  - Piggyback  
  - Extra Die Roll  
  - Movement Swap  
  - Free a Wizard  
  - Nudge Ravenskeep  
  - Close Ravenskeep  

3. Setup  
1. Arrange the 4 landscape tiles in a circle to form a continuous path.  
2. Place Ravenskeep on its designated starting space (black walls image).  
3. Clockwise from Ravenskeep, place the 9 towers on the next 9 spaces, starting with a raven tower and alternating raven/normal.  
4. Set magic spells:  
   - First game: Place "Advance a Wizard" and "Advance a Tower" face up.  
   - Optional: Choose any number of spells (more = more tactical).  
5. Shuffle the 90 movement cards. Deal 3 to each player. Place the rest in the center as a draw deck.  
6. Place the die and discard pile near the deck.  
7. Choose a starting player; give them the starting player token.  
8. Players choose a color and take:  
   - 2 players: 5 wizards, 6 potion bottles  
   - 3–4 players: 4 wizards, 5 potion bottles  
   - 5–6 players: 3 wizards, 4 potion bottles  
9. Distribute wizards to towers clockwise from the first tower after Ravenskeep:  
   - Spaces have blue lights indicating max wizards: first 3 spaces = 3 wizards, next 3 = 2, next 3 = 1  
   - In turn order, each player places one wizard on the current tower until full, then move to next  
   - Continue until all wizards are placed  
10. Place each wizard meeple on top of its tower.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise.  
- On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:  
  a) **Play 2 Cards**:  
     - Play two cards from your hand, one at a time, resolving each fully.  
     - After both actions, draw 2 cards (hand must end with 3).  
  b) **Refresh Hand**:  
     - Discard all cards in hand.  
     - Move any one tower 1 space clockwise.  
     - Draw 3 cards (hand ends with 3).  
- At **any time during your turn**, you may spend full potion bottles to cast **one** magic spell.  
- After turn actions, refill hand to 3 cards.  
- When draw deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form a new deck.

5. Core Mechanics  
**Movement Cards (3 types)**  
- **Wizard Movement (right side)**:  
  - Move one of your visible wizards clockwise.  
  - Number: move exactly that many spaces.  
  - Die icon: roll die for movement.  
    - 2 dice: 1 re-roll allowed.  
    - 3 dice: 2 re-rolls allowed.  
  - If wizard ends on Ravenskeep:  
    1. Wizard enters Ravenskeep permanently.  
    2. Move Ravenskeep clockwise to next unoccupied space/tower with raven icon.  
    3. Turn ends immediately.  
  - Wizard cannot stop early to enter Ravenskeep; must use full movement.  

- **Tower Movement (left side)**:  
  - Move any tower (and stack atop it, including Ravenskeep if present).  
  - Number: move exactly that many spaces.  
  - Die icon: roll die (re-rolls as above).  
  - Cannot move a tower onto Ravenskeep.  
  - If tower lands on space with wizards: they are imprisoned (hidden under tower).  
  - When you imprison **any** wizard(s), flip one of your empty potion bottles to full.  
  - Cannot move a tower if it would end atop Ravenskeep; if attempted, turn ends immediately without moving.  

- **Either Wizard or Tower (both sides)**:  
  - Choose to use either action.  
  - Announce choice before movement.  
  - Follow rules for the chosen type.

**Imprisoning Wizards**  
- Wizards are hidden when covered by a tower.  
- You may not peek under towers.  
- You gain one filled potion bottle per tower move that imprisons wizards (only once per move, regardless of number imprisoned).  
- Imprisoned wizards must be freed to reach Ravenskeep.

**Casting Spells**  
- Spend full potion bottles as indicated on spell token.  
- Cast only one spell per turn, at any time during your action.  
- Spent bottles are returned to the box.  
- If spell causes a wizard to enter Ravenskeep, turn ends immediately.  

**Available Spells**  
- **Advance a Wizard**: Move any 1 visible wizard +1 space clockwise.  
- **Advance a Tower**: Move any 1 tower +2 spaces clockwise. Cannot move onto Ravenskeep.  
- **Headwind for a Wizard**: Move any 1 visible wizard -1 space counterclockwise.  
- **Headwind for a Tower**: Move any 1 tower -2 spaces counterclockwise.  
- **Fill a Magic Potion Flask**: Flip one of your empty bottles to full.  
- **Swap a Tower**: Swap top towers of two stacks (including single towers). Wizards move with towers.  
- **Retrieve a Card**: Take top card from discard pile into hand. Cannot draw again until hand < 3.  
- **Draw2Cards**: Draw 2 cards. Cannot draw again until hand < 3.  
- **Piggyback**: Cast when current player moves a wizard from a space/tower where you also have a wizard. Their move carries your wizard too. Can be used on yourself if you have ≥2 wizards on the space.  
- **Extra Die Roll**: After playing a movement card with a die, reroll the die. Must use new result.  
- **Movement Swap**: Swap movement values on card:  
  - Wizard/tower card: values switch  
  - Wizard-only → moves a tower  
  - Tower-only → moves a wizard  
- **Free a Wizard**: Lift any tower to free one of your own wizards. Place wizard on top of that stack. If Ravenskeep is on top, wizard enters Ravenskeep. If no your wizards are under, spell fails and is wasted.  
- **Nudge Ravenskeep**: Move Ravenskeep clockwise or counterclockwise to next unoccupied space or tower (does not need raven icon).  
- **Close Ravenskeep**: Place this spell face down (brambles up) on Ravenskeep. Blocks entry until start of your next turn. Cannot cast again while active.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after all players have had an equal number of turns.  
- Trigger: A player fills all potion bottles **and** has all wizards in Ravenskeep.  
- Final check:  
  - If only one player meets both conditions, they win.  
  - If multiple players meet both, the one with the most **unspent** full potion bottles wins.  
  - If still tied, players share victory.  
- Note: Potion bottles count as filled even if later spent.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you move Ravenskeep onto a tower without a raven icon?**  
  Yes, only when using "Nudge Ravenskeep" spell. Normally, Ravenskeep moves only to spaces/towers with raven icons.  
- **Can you imprison your own wizards?**  
  Yes. You still gain one filled potion bottle.  
- **Can you use a spell after playing only one card?**  
  Yes, at any time during your turn.  
- **Can you use "Free a Wizard" on a stack with Ravenskeep on top?**  
  Yes. If your wizard is freed, they enter Ravenskeep immediately.  
- **What happens if you play a tower move that would land on Ravenskeep?**  
  The move is invalid. Your turn ends immediately without moving.  
- **Can you use "Advance a Tower" to move Ravenskeep?**  
  No. Ravenskeep is not a tower.  
- **Can you use "Piggyback" during your own turn?**  
  Yes, if you are moving a wizard from a space where you have ≥2 wizards.  
- **Can you cast a spell that moves a wizard into Ravenskeep and end your turn?**  
  Yes. Turn ends immediately, even if you haven’t played two cards.
