## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the aftermath of a devastating civil war, the city of Blue Moon lies in ruins. The royal heirs are exiled, and the people, once divided, now unite to rebuild. The three Elemental Dragons—Fire, Earth, and Water—have returned to aid in the restoration of the Holy Crystal of Psi atop the Obelisk. Players take on the roles of leaders guiding the reconstruction of the city’s buildings, earning rewards and contributing crystals to the Obelisk. The first player to make the required number of offerings to the Obelisk wins the game and becomes the new steward of Blue Moon City.

2. Components  
- 20 double-sided Building tiles (rubble and reconstructed sides)  
- 4 double-sided expansion Building tiles (rubble and reconstructed sides)

3. Setup  
- Place the Courtyard tile in the center of the table.  
- Randomly place the 4 Starting tiles (marked with ●) orthogonally adjacent to the Courtyard, rubble-side up.  
- Shuffle the remaining base Building tiles and place them rubble-side up to form a 5×5 "+" shape (no corner tiles).  
  - Variant: Randomly place all tiles (including Starting tiles) around the Courtyard.  
  - Expansion: Include the 4 expansion tiles (marked with ⊙) and form a full 5×5 grid (including corners).  
- Attach Counter Bases to the 3 Dragon figures and place them near the board.  
- Place the Obelisk near the board, using the side corresponding to player count.  
- Place Golden Scale tokens near the Obelisk:  
  - 2 players: 7 scales  
  - 3 players: 10 scales  
  - 4 players: 12 scales  
- Each player chooses a color, places their miniature on the Courtyard, and takes 10 Player markers.  
- Shuffle the People cards and deal 8 to each player. Place the rest face-down as a draw deck.  
- Randomly select the first player. Play proceeds clockwise.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, perform the following phases in order:  
1. Movement Phase (optional)  
2. Contribution Phase (optional)  
3. Reset Phase (mandatory)  
4. Pass Turn  

1. Movement Phase  
- Move your miniature orthogonally up to 2 spaces.  
- During movement, you may discard cards to use their powers (e.g., Flit to teleport, or dragon movement cards).  

2. Contribution Phase  
- If you end your movement on a building tile, you may contribute to it.  
- If you end on the Courtyard, you may make an offering to the Obelisk.  
- To contribute: Discard cards of matching color with total value ≥ a Contribution Space on the tile. Place one of your markers on that space.  
- You may make multiple contributions per turn, but each must be fully paid with separate cards.  
- During this phase, you may discard cards to use their special powers (e.g., Hoax to change card colors).  

3. Reset Phase  
- Discard up to 2 cards from your hand.  
- Draw 2 more cards than you discarded (e.g., discard 0 → draw 2; discard 2 → draw 4).  
- If the deck is empty, reshuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.  

4. Pass Turn  
- End your turn. Play passes clockwise.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Building Reconstruction: When the last Contribution Space on a tile is filled, the building is complete. Flip it to the reconstructed side and score bonuses.  
- Scoring Buildings:  
  - Majority Bonus: Awarded to the player with the most markers. Tie: leftmost marker wins.  
  - Construction Bonus: All contributing players receive this reward.  
  - Neighborhood Bonus: All contributors receive the Neighborhood Bonus from each orthogonally adjacent reconstructed building (once per building).  
- Golden Scales:  
  - Earn 1 scale per dragon present when making a contribution (only for the first contribution per turn).  
  - Earn scales from Neighborhood Bonuses or Majority Bonuses.  
  - When the last scale is taken from the supply, score immediately:  
    - Most scales: +6 crystals (tie: all tied get +3).  
    - Other players with ≥3 scales: +3 crystals.  
    - Players with <3 scales: keep scales, gain no crystals.  
  - All players who gain crystals return their scales to the supply.  
- Crystals & Obelisk:  
  - Crystals are kept face-down. Unlimited supply—track mentally if needed.  
  - To make an offering: End movement in Courtyard, pay crystals equal to the next lowest available space on the Obelisk. Place one of your markers on that space.  
  - Only one offering per turn unless using Pillar card.  
  - Dragons in Courtyard do not grant scales for offerings.  
- Card Powers:  
  - Vulca (Black): 1 → move Red Dragon anywhere; 2 → move Red Dragon up to 3 spaces (if in city).  
  - Terrah (Red): 1 → move Green Dragon anywhere; 2 → move Green Dragon up to 3 spaces (if in city).  
  - Aqua (Blue): 1 → move Blue Dragon anywhere; 2 → move Blue Dragon up to 3 spaces (if in city).  
  - Flit (Grey): 1 → move your miniature anywhere; 2 → move up to 2 extra spaces.  
  - Khind (Green): Any Khind card = wild card of value 1 (any color).  
  - Mimix (Brown): Any two Mimix cards = wild card of value 3 (any color).  
  - Hoax (White): 1 → change color of up to 4 cards (same original color → same new color); 2 → change one card’s color.  
  - Pillar (Yellow): 1 → make additional Obelisk offering (+1 crystal cost); 2 → additional offering (+2 crystal cost).  
- Special Buildings (Expansion):  
  - Main Hall: Move to any building tile. Cannot contribute, make offering, or use its action after moving.  
  - Hospital: Draw 2 People cards.  
  - Golden Shrine: Make 1 offering to Obelisk. Cannot use Pillar card.  
  - Theatre: No additional action.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- A player wins immediately upon making the required number of Obelisk offerings:  
  - 2 players: 6 offerings  
  - 3 players: 5 offerings  
  - 4 players: 4 offerings  
- If all buildings are rebuilt and no player can make required offerings:  
  - Continue until all players make as many offerings as possible.  
  - Most offerings wins. Tie: most remaining crystals. If still tied, shared victory.  
- If all players run out of Player markers and no one has won: game ends in a draw.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I use a card for both its value and power? No. Once used for power, it cannot contribute. Exceptions: Khind and Mimix, which can be used for both.  
- Can I contribute multiple times in one turn? Yes, but each contribution must be fully paid with separate cards. No carryover.  
- Do dragons grant scales for multiple contributions in one turn? No. Only the first contribution earns dragon scales.  
- Can I use Pillar card after using Golden Shrine action? No. Golden Shrine explicitly forbids using Pillar.  
- Can I move a dragon into the city? Yes, using a “1” card of matching color.  
- What if the crystal supply runs out? Crystals are unlimited. Track mentally.  
- What if the card deck runs out? Reshuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.  
- Can I make multiple offerings in one turn? Only with Pillar card or Golden Shrine (1 offering only, no Pillar).  
- Do I get scales for completing a building with a dragon present? No. Scales are only awarded during contribution, not during scoring.
