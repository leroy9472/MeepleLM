# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
One player takes on the role of Count Dracula, moving secretly across 19th-century Europe, evading hunters while advancing his Vampire Track toward 6 points. The other players control a team of Hunters—Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Van Helsing, and Mina Harker—who cooperate to track down and destroy Dracula before he achieves victory.

**Win Conditions:**
- **Hunters win** by reducing Dracula to 0 Blood.
- **Dracula wins** by advancing the Vampire Track to 6.

Dracula gains Vampire Points by:
- +1 when a new day dawns (Day/Night marker reaches Dawn).
- +2 when defeating a Hunter (reducing to 0 Health or full Bite slots).
- +2 when maturing a *New Vampire* encounter.

## 2. Components
- Game board of Europe

7. Each Hunter places their miniature in a starting city (not Castle Dracula, Hospital, or sea zone).
8. Dracula chooses a starting location (not sea, not Castle Dracula, not a city with a Hunter), places the Location card face down on the leftmost space of his Trail, and places his miniature on it.
9. Place Day/Night marker on Dawn.
10. Game begins with Lord Godalming’s turn (skip Dracula’s first turn).

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each full round consists of:
1. **Timekeeping Phase** (Dracula only, unless at sea)
2. **Dracula’s Turn** (Movement + Action)
3. **Each Hunter’s Turn** in order: Lord Godalming → Dr. Seward → Van Helsing → Mina Harker

Each **Hunter turn**:
- Optional: Spend 1 Resolve
- Movement Phase (Road, Rail, or Sea)
- Action Phase (if not at sea)

Each **Dracula turn**:
- Timekeeping (if not at sea)
- Movement Phase (Road or Sea; may use Power)
- Action Phase (if not at sea)

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Movement
- **Road**: Move 1 connected city.
- **Sea**: Embark (pay 1 Blood), sail (pay 1 Blood every other turn), disembark. Cannot backtrack.
- **Rail**: Roll Train die:
  - X: Turn ends, no action
  - 0: Cannot move by rail, may move by road/sea
  - 1: Move up to 1 city by rail
  - 2: Move up to 2 cities by rail
  - 2/3: Move up to 3 cities by rail in Western Europe; up to 2 in Eastern Europe

### Dracula’s Hidden Movement
- Dracula plays Location cards face down on his Trail, sliding existing cards right.
- If he moves into a Hunter’s city, the card is played face up.
- When the Trail is full (6 cards), the rightmost card drops off. Dracula may:
  - Return it to the Location deck (can mature its encounter)
  - Place it in a Catacomb (add 1 extra encounter; cannot mature)

### Encounters
- Dracula places 1 face-down Encounter per turn (unless attacking).
- When a Hunter enters a city with an Encounter, Dracula reveals and resolves it.
- Encounters are resolved one at a time; turn ends if encounter says so.
- **Matured Encounters**: When a card drops off the Trail, Dracula may reveal and resolve the "Matured" effect.

### Resolve Actions (1 per turn)
- **Newspaper Reports**: Reveal the oldest unrevealed card in Dracula’s Trail (not current location).
- **Sense of Emergency**: Move up to 2 cities by road/rail (no die roll); lose 2 Health. Or move up to 3 cities; lose 4 Health.
- **Inner Strength**: Heal 4 Health to any one Hunter.

### Combat
**Start of Combat:**
- All players may play pre-combat cards (e.g., Trap, Advance Planning).
- Hunter builds combat deck: Tactics cards + Item cards (only those with initiative number).
- Dracula builds deck:
  - vs. Agent: Agent Tactics (Punch, Dodge, + equipment)
  - vs. Dracula: 3 cards by day (Claws, Dodge, Escape), 8 by night

**Combat Round:**
1. Each player selects a card (cannot reuse same physical card twice in a row).
2. Reveal cards, roll dice:
   - Hunter rolls white die
   - Dracula rolls black die
   - Lord Godalming rolls 2 dice vs. Agent, uses higher
3. Add modifiers:
   - **Hunter**: +1 for Advance Planning, +1 for Pistol, +1 if won previous round with Dodge
   - **Agent**: +1 in Eastern Europe, +1 for Trap, +1 for Pistol, +1 if won previous round with Dodge
   - **Dracula**: +1 if Bitten Hunter (not Mina) in combat, +1 in Castle Dracula, +1 for Trap, +1 if won previous round with Dodge
4. Highest total wins. Tie: higher initiative wins.
5. Winner looks up loser’s card on their card; left symbol is result.

**Combat Results:**
- **Wound (1–4)**: Lose Health/Blood.
- **Continue**: Nothing. Three in a row = End.
- **Repel**: Dracula may only play Dodge or Escape next round.
- **Bite**: Hunter receives Bite token. If no open slots, Hunter is defeated. Combat ends.
- **Killed**:
  - Agent: defeated, combat ends.
  - Dracula: Blood drops to next red space on track. If 0, Hunters win.
- **End**: Combat ends.

**Item Destruction:**
- If winning card lists losing card in **bold**, the Hunter’s card is destroyed (discard after round).

**Combat Ends When:**
- End result
- 3 consecutive Continues
- Hunter is Bitten or reduced to 0 Health
- Agent is Killed
- Dracula reduced to 0 Blood

### Bitten Hunters
- Must keep 1 Item and 1 Event card face up (Dogs does not count).
- Dracula gets +1 to combat rolls vs. them (except Mina).
- Can be targeted by certain Dracula events.
- Can attempt healing at Hospital: roll die at start of Movement Phase:
  - 1: Lose 2 Health
  - 2–3: No effect
  - 4–6: Remove 1 Bite

### Defeated Hunters
- Dracula gains +2 Vampire points.
- Hunter moved to Hospital.
- Discards all Item and Event cards.
- Health reset to max, Bites removed.
- Skips next turn.

### Hunter Groups
- Formed when 2+ Hunters start turn in same city and none have moved.
- Move as one; only one Train die roll.
- One Action Phase per group:
  - Only one member may Rest or Resupply.
  - All may Trade.
- Encounters affect all equally; any member may use Item to mitigate.
- **Group Combat**:
  - Each Hunter selects a card.
  - Dracula chooses one Hunter as target each round.
  - If Dracula wins, result applies only to target.
  - If Hunters win, they choose which card to apply.
  - Combat ends if any Hunter is Bitten, Defeated, or Escapes.

### Special Locations
- **Castle Dracula**:
  - Dracula’s location is revealed upon arrival.
  - Dracula gains 2 Blood after Movement Phase.
  - No encounters placed.
  - Hunters cannot Rest, Resupply, or Trade.
  - Dracula gets +1 to combat rolls.
- **Hospital of St. Joseph and St. Mary**:
  - Dracula cannot enter or place encounters.
  - Hunter may draw 1 Event or 1 Item when Resupplying.
  - Hunter may attempt to heal Bites (die roll as above).

## 6. Scoring & End Game
**Dracula Wins If:**
- Vampire Track reaches 6 (from dawns, maturing *New Vampire*, or defeating Hunters).

**Hunters Win If:**
- Dracula’s Blood is reduced to 0 (via combat or Heroic Leap).

Game ends immediately when either condition is met.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Illegal Move by Dracula**: If Dracula has no legal move, or is caught cheating:
  - Trail cleared to 1 card
  - Current location revealed
  - Blood reduced to next red space (min 1)
- **Event Deck Runs Low**: When only 1 card remains, reshuffle discard pile into new deck.
- **Ally Cards**: Each side may have only one Ally in play. Played immediately or discarded.
- **Drawing Events**: Always from bottom of deck. Cross-back = Hunter, Bat-back = Dracula.
- **Mina Harker**: Starts with Bite; must keep 1 Item and 1 Event face up; no +1 bonus to Dracula in combat.
- **Dr. Seward**: Can hold 4 Item or 4 Event cards; any Hunter in same city draws only 1 Event when Resting.
