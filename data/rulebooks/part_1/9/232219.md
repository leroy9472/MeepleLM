## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Dragon Castle is set in a realm where the ancient Dragon Castle is in decline, losing favor with the Eldest Dragon. The people are abandoning it, and rival lords (players) seek to build their own realms by claiming tiles from the crumbling Dragon Castle. The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VP) by constructing tile sets, building shrines, fulfilling a Dragon card objective, and collecting VP tokens.

### 2. Components
- 1 Central board (player count-specific)
- 116 tiles:
  - 72 Faction tiles (24 Merchants, 24 Soldiers, 24 Farmers; numbered 1–6)
  - 44 Special tiles (16 Seasons, 16 Winds, 12 Dragons)
- 4 Realm boards
- 40 Shrines
- 85 VP tokens
- 7 Countdown tokens (each worth 2 VP)
- 1 First Player token
- 10 Spirit cards
- 10 Dragon cards

### 3. Setup
1. Place the Central board matching player count. Shuffle all 116 tiles and build the Dragon Castle:
   - Stacks of 3 tiles on spaces marked "3"
   - Stacks of 2 tiles on spaces marked "2"
   - Single tiles on spaces marked "1"
   - All tiles face up.
2. Place Shrines and VP tokens in a general pool.
3. Place all Countdown tokens in a stack on the leftmost space of the Countdown track. Move tokens to cover spaces up to and including the number of players.
4. (Optional) Shuffle and reveal 1 Spirit card (shared power) and 1 Dragon card (end-game objective). Return the rest to the box.
5. Each player takes a Realm board and 1 Shrine (placed in their Shrine Pool).
6. Determine First Player (e.g., last to see a dragon) and give them the First Player token.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Players take turns clockwise.
- On your turn:
  1. **Take 1 Mandatory Action** (see Core Mechanics).
  2. **Place collected tiles** on your Realm board (face up, on empty or face-down tile spaces only).
  3. **Consolidate** if you now have 4+ orthogonally adjacent tiles of the same type.
  4. **Build Shrines** on newly consolidated tiles (if eligible).
  5. **(Optional)** Activate Spirit Power by discarding a face-up tile or Shrine.
- Game ends when the exclamation mark (!) is revealed on the Countdown track. Play continues until the player to the right of the First Player completes their turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Available Tile**: A tile with at least one long side unblocked (orthogonally exposed).

**Mandatory Actions** (choose one per turn):
- **Pair of Tiles**: Take 1 available tile from the top floor, then take an *identical* (same type and symbol) available tile from any floor.
- **Tile and Shrine**: Take 1 available tile from the top floor, then take 1 Shrine from the general pool into your Shrine Pool.
- **Discard Tile**: Take 1 available tile from the top floor, discard it face down, gain 1 VP.
- **Summon the Dragon**: Only available when only ground-floor tiles remain. Take the rightmost Countdown token (worth 2 VP). If no tiles remain, this action is mandatory.

**Placing Tiles**:
- Place new tiles face up.
- Only on empty spaces or on top of face-down tiles.
- Never on face-up tiles or on stacks with a Shrine.

**Consolidating Sets**:
- After placing tiles, if you have 4+ orthogonally adjacent tiles of the same *type* (Faction or Special), you **must** consolidate.
- Flip all tiles in the set face down.
- Score VPs based on set size:
  - 4 tiles: 2 VP
  - 5 tiles: 3 VP
  - 6 tiles: 5 VP
  - 7 tiles: 6 VP
  - 8+ tiles: 1 VP per tile
- For each tile beyond 8, gain +1 VP.

**Building Shrines**:
- After consolidating, you may build Shrines on the *newly flipped* face-down tiles.
- Number allowed:
  - Faction tiles (Merchants, Soldiers, Farmers): 1 Shrine
  - Special tiles (Seasons, Winds, Dragons): 2 Shrines
  - Dragon tiles: 2 Shrines + 1 bonus VP
- You cannot build Shrines on previously consolidated tiles.
- Only 1 Shrine per stack.

**Spirit Power**:
- At any point during your turn, you may discard 1 face-up tile or 1 Shrine to activate the revealed Spirit card.
- Each Spirit has a unique power (see Spirit Card Powers in rulebook).
- Can only be activated once per player per turn.
- Effects are mandatory.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End Game Trigger**:
- When only ground-floor tiles remain, "Summon the Dragon" becomes available.
- When the exclamation mark (!) is revealed on the Countdown track, the final round begins. All players take one more turn (starting with First Player).

**Final Scoring**:
- **VP Tokens**: Collected during the game.
- **Countdown Tokens**: Each worth 2 VP.
- **Shrines**:
  - 1 tile high: 1 VP
  - 2 tiles high: 2 VP
  - 3+ tiles high: 3 VP
- **Dragon Card Objective**: Score bonus VPs based on the revealed Dragon card (e.g., symmetry, adjacency, tile diversity).
- **Total all VP sources**.

**Tiebreaker**:
1. Most stacks with a face-down tile on top.
2. Most Shrines in Realm.
3. Shared victory if still tied.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I place tiles non-adjacently?** Yes. Placement does not require adjacency.
- **Can I consolidate across different heights?** Yes, as long as tiles are orthogonally adjacent.
- **Can I build a Shrine on a face-down tile from a previous turn?** No. Shrines must be built immediately after consolidation.
- **Can I activate Spirit Power before taking my action?** Yes. It can be done at any time during your turn.
- **Can I use Spirit of Deception to take a non-identical adjacent tile?** Yes, as the second tile in a "Pair of Tiles" action.
- **Can a dummy player (solo mode) Summon the Dragon?** Yes, but only when no tiles remain.
