## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Ricochet Robots is a puzzle-solving game of logic and spatial reasoning. Players compete to find the shortest path for a robot to reach a target space on a modular board. The objective is to collect the most Target Chips by being the first to correctly solve and verify the shortest solution.

### 2. Components  
- 17 Target Chips:  
  - 4 each in red, yellow, green, blue  
  - 1 multi-colored swirl (Vortex)  
- 8 double-sided board tiles  
- 5 robots: red, yellow, green, blue, black  
- 5 Position Markers (color-matched to robots)  
- 1 gameboard centerpiece (connects 4 tiles)  
- 1 one-minute sand timer  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Assemble the Gameboard:**  
   - Snap 4 board tiles around the centerpiece.  
   - Each tile must show a different color marking (red, yellow, green, blue) near its center cutout.  
   - There are 1,536 valid configurations.  
   - *Optional (Beginner Rule):* Avoid tiles with diagonal colored barriers.

2. **Prepare Target Chips:**  
   - Shuffle all 17 Target Chips face-down (gray side up).  
   - Place them in a draw pile next to the board.

3. **Place Robots:**  
   - Randomly place the 5 robots on the board.  
   - Do not place on the centerpiece or any Target Space (colored spaces matching Target Chips).  
   - *Optional (Beginner Rule):* Omit the Black Robot.

4. **Position Markers:**  
   - Place each robot’s matching Position Marker under it.

5. **Timer:**  
   - Place the sand timer within reach of all players.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Start of Round:**  
   - Flip one Target Chip face-up and place it on the centerpiece.  
   - All players simultaneously think of a solution (no physical movement).

2. **Bidding Phase:**  
   - Any player who has a solution may call out a move count (e.g., “7”).  
   - First bid starts the one-minute sand timer.  
   - All other players may bid once or multiple times, but only lower bids are allowed after initial bid.  
   - No player may increase a previous bid.  
   - Bidding ends when the timer runs out.

3. **Verification Phase:**  
   - The player with the lowest bid verifies first.  
   - They physically move robots, counting aloud.  
   - All moves must be traceable and valid.  
   - If verification fails:  
     - Robots return to Position Markers.  
     - Next lowest bidder attempts verification.  
   - Continue until a successful verification or no bidders remain.

4. **End of Round:**  
   - If verified successfully:  
     - The player collects the Target Chip.  
     - Robots remain in final positions; Position Markers are updated.  
   - If no verification succeeds:  
     - Return Target Chip to the pile, reshuffle.  
     - Robots return to Position Markers.  
   - Begin a new round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Robot Movement:**  
  - Move any robot horizontally or vertically (never diagonally).  
  - Movement continues in a straight line until blocked by a wall or another robot (obstacle).  
  - Cannot change direction mid-move.  
  - Each movement (regardless of distance) counts as **1 move**.  
  - Position Markers are **not** obstacles.

- **Active Robot Requirement:**  
  - The robot matching the color of the Target Chip is **Active**.  
  - Only the Active Robot can end on the Target Space.  
  - **Exception:** Vortex allows any robot to be Active.

- **Ricochet Rule:**  
  - The Active Robot **must ricochet at least once** (bounce off an obstacle at a right angle) during its path.  
  - Single-move solutions (direct line-of-sight) are invalid.  
  - If the Active Robot is already on or has line-of-sight to the Target Space:  
    - Return the Target Chip, reshuffle, start a new round.  
    - *Exception:* If it’s the Vortex, see Vortex rules.

- **Diagonal Colored Barriers (on some tiles):**  
  - A robot of the **matching color** passes through the barrier as if it weren’t there.  
  - Robots of **other colors** bounce off at a right angle.  
  - Movement through or off a barrier still counts as **1 move**.  
  - A robot **cannot end a move on a barrier**—this is invalid.

- **Black Robot:**  
  - Functions identically to other robots.  
  - Can be used as an obstacle or moved freely.  
  - Optional rule (from expansion): When a Black Tile is the target, the Black Robot must reach it.

- **Vortex (Multi-colored Target Chip):**  
  - All robots are **Active**—any robot may reach the Vortex space.  
  - **Exception:** If any robot is already on the Vortex or has line-of-sight to it at round start, that robot becomes **Non-Active**.  
  - If **all** robots are Non-Active due to this, treat as invalid single-move solution:  
    - Return chip, reshuffle, new round.  
    - Alternatively, use Secret Auction tie-breaker.

- **Robot on Target Space at Start:**  
  - If a **Non-Active** robot occupies the Target Space:  
    - It must be moved out as part of the solution.  
  - If the **Active** robot occupies the Target Space:  
    - Treat as invalid single-move solution (unless Vortex).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Winning Conditions (by player count):**  
  - 2 players: First to 8 Target Chips wins.  
  - 3 players: First to 6 wins.  
  - 4 players: First to 5 wins.  
  - 5+ players: Play until all 17 chips are used; most chips wins.  
- **Ties:**  
  - Players tie and **share the win**.  
  - Optional: Use **Secret Auction** tie-breaker (e.g., paper-rock-scissors, most chips, least chips).

- **Alternative Scoring (Infinity Mode):**  
  - Winner of round gets **0 points**.  
  - All others get points equal to the winning move count.  
  - Play to a time limit or until a player exceeds a set score (e.g., 50).  
  - Lowest total score wins.  
  - Recommended with One and Done and Taxation rules.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **No Bids Made?**  
  - Wait 5 minutes; if no bids, start timer.  
  - If still no bids after timer, return chip, reshuffle, new round.

- **Can I move multiple robots in a solution?**  
  - Yes. Any number of robots may be moved. Each movement counts as 1 move.

- **Can robots end on Target Spaces during movement?**  
  - Yes, as long as it's not the final move unless it's the Active Robot and the correct target.

- **What if a robot stops on a diagonal barrier?**  
  - Invalid. Must reroute so it stops before or after, not on the barrier.

- **Can I use Position Markers to track temporary positions during thinking?**  
  - No. Only physical robot movement occurs during verification.

- **What if I forget my solution during verification?**  
  - Failure to recall in reasonable time = failed verification.
