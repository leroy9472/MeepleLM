## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Dogs of War is a game of mercenary captains vying for victory points through strategic involvement in battles between six noble houses. Players do not represent the houses, but rather independent "Dogs of War" — mercenary leaders who support factions for profit, influence, and reputation. The goal is to amass the most victory points over four years (rounds) by winning battles, claiming rewards, and leveraging unique leader abilities.

2. Components  
- Main board with:  
  - Victory track (for house banners)  
  - Three battle tracks (numbered 0–15)  
  - Round/year marker  
  - First-player token (large black)  
- House banners (plastic) — one per house  
- Battle trackers (red tokens) — one per battle  
- Tactic cards — shuffled into a draw deck  
- Soldier cards — sorted by type and placed face-up  
- Player screens  
- Captains (miniatures) — 3 per player  
- Coins ($1 tokens)  
- House support cards — each shows two banners of one house  
- Bonus reward tokens (square tiles) — worth VP or special rewards  
- Order of Battle cards — assign rewards per battle each round  

3. Setup  
Main Board:  
- Place each house banner on the '-1' space of the victory track  
- Set year marker to Year 1  
- Randomly assign first-player token  
- Place red battle trackers on '0' of each battle track  
- Shuffle tactic cards and place face-down on designated space  
- Sort soldier cards by type and place face-up near the board  

Player Setup:  
- Each player receives:  
  - 3 captains (miniatures)  
  - $8 (kept secret behind player screen)  
  - 2 random tactic cards  
  - 1 random house support card (grants two influence tokens of one house)  
- All coins and cards are kept secret throughout the game  

Special Setup for 3 Players:  
- Use only 2 of the 3 battle tracks; return the third to the box  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each year (round) consists of the following phases:  

**A. Round Setup**  
- Advance round marker (rounds 2, 3, 4 only)  
- Players receive:  
  - $3 income (except in Round 1)  
  - 1 additional captain (in Rounds 2 and 4 only)  
    - Total captains available per round: 3 / 4 / 4 / 5 for Rounds 1 / 2 / 3 / 4  
- Randomly assign house cards, battle reward cards, and bonus reward tokens to each active battle  
  - In Round 4, all bonus reward tokens are worth 3 VP  
- First player may transfer the first-player token to any other player  

**B. Muster Troops (Purchasing Phase)**  
- Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, players may buy any number of soldier cards  
- Cost is equal to the printed number (1–4 coins)  
- Players may buy multiple cards in a single turn, but only one purchasing opportunity per round  
- If a soldier type is sold out, no more can be bought  
- All purchases are secret  

**C. Assign Troops (Action Phase)**  
Players take turns performing the following actions in order:  

1. **Optional:** Play one tactic card (if desired; follow its effect)  
2. **Mandatory:** Play one soldier card on one side of any active battle  
   - Advance the battle tracker by the soldier’s strength (up to 15)  
3. **Mandatory:** Place one captain on a reward slot of that battle’s Order of Battle card  
   - Take the reward immediately (e.g., VP, coin, tactic card, influence token, bonus captain, soldier card)  
   - Some rewards require specific soldier types to be eligible  
   - A player cannot place captains on both sides of the same battle unless they played the "Betrayal" tactic card  

Special Rule:  
- If a reward slot shows a staff symbol, the player gains an extra captain **for this round only**  

Turn Order:  
- After all players have passed, the first player to pass receives the first-player token for the next round  

Passing:  
- A player may pass at any time during their turn  
- When passing, discard all remaining captains (they do not carry over)  
- Players with no captains left are skipped until the phase ends  

**D. Battle Outcome (Resolution Phase)**  
Resolve each battle in turn:  

- Compare total strength on each side (sum of soldier values)  
- If tied: no winner; nothing happens  
- Otherwise:  
  - Winning house advances 1 space on the victory track  
  - **Exception:** If battle tracker is at 15, winning house advances **2 spaces**, and losing house retreats **1 space** (cannot go below -1)  

Player Rewards:  
- Each player with at least one captain on the **winning side** gains **1 VP per captain** that was on the **losing side** (including their own and others’)  
  - No points if no captains were on the losing side  
- The player(s) with the **most captains** on the winning side claim the **bonus reward token**  
  - In case of tie, all tied players receive the bonus reward  
  - If bonus reward shows a staff, recipient gains **1 extra captain for the next round only**

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Captains:** Used to claim rewards; discarded at end of each round; gained in rounds 2 and 4  
- **Soldier Cards:** Used to contribute strength to battles; purchased during Muster phase; value determines advancement of battle tracker  
- **Tactic Cards:** One-time use; played during Assign Troops phase; may break standard rules (e.g., Betrayal allows dual-side play)  
- **Rewards:** Immediate benefits from placing captains; some require matching soldier types  
- **Victory Track:** Determines final scoring; house position multiplied by player’s influence in that house  
- **House Influence:** Comes from house support card (2 tokens) and any influence tokens gained via rewards  

Special Leader Abilities ("Dogs of War"):  
- **Grey (Sir Blackmane):** After claiming a bonus reward, take the highest-value soldier card from the losing side’s discard pile  
- **Pink (Lady Ordalia Macbeth):** Counts as having +1 captain when determining bonus reward eligibility  
- **Yellow (Captain O’Malley):** Earn $1 for each battle in which he has at least one captain on the winning side  
- **Brown (The Nameless Conqueror):** At end of round, may move battle tracker 2 additional spaces in favor of side he supports (must have a captain in that battle)  
  - Cannot use if tracker is already at 15 for the opponent  
- **Green (Stormcrow):** Captains on losing side do **not** grant VP to opponents  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after Round 4. Players score:  

- **In-game VP tokens** collected during play  
- **Unused tactic and soldier cards:** 1 VP each  
- **Coins:** 1 VP per $2 (round down)  
- **Victory Track Influence:**  
  For each house:  
  - Multiply the house’s position on the victory track (including -1) by the number of that house’s influence tokens the player holds  
  - Sum all values (can be negative)  

Total all above for final score. Highest score wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a tactic card without playing a soldier?**  
  No. You must play a soldier and place a captain to take an action. Tactic card is optional but cannot be played alone.  

- **What happens to leftover soldiers and tactic cards?**  
  They remain secret and are worth 1 VP each at endgame.  

- **Do I lose influence tokens if my supported house loses?**  
  No. Influence tokens are permanent and used only for final scoring.  

- **Can I use The Nameless Conqueror’s ability multiple times?**  
  No. It can only be used once per battle, per player, per round — and only if the player has a captain in that battle.  

- **Does Lady Ordalia’s +1 captain apply to all captain counts?**  
  Only for determining bonus reward eligibility. It does not affect VP from losing captains or other mechanics.  

- **If I play Betrayal, can I place captains on both sides every turn?**  
  Yes. Once played, you may support both sides for the remainder of the round.  

- **Are rewards taken immediately?**  
  Yes. When placing a captain on a reward slot, claim the reward instantly. If unavailable (e.g., no soldier cards left), you do not receive it.  

- **Do captains carry over between rounds?**  
  No. All captains are discarded when you pass. Additional captains are granted in Rounds 2 and 4.
