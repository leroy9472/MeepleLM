## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Middle-Earth Quest is a cooperative adventure board game where one player takes the role of Sauron while the others play heroic characters from Middle-earth. The heroes work to complete their mission and ultimately defeat the Ringwraiths in a final battle. Sauron aims to fulfill his own mission or prevent the heroes from succeeding. The game ends in a Finale triggered when either the heroes' story marker reaches the Finale space or all three of Sauron’s story markers reach "The Shadow Falls" space.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Dominance**: Determined by comparing distances:  
  - Heroes: spaces from their marker to Finale.  
  - Sauron: minimum of (closest marker to Finale) or (cumulative spaces for all markers to reach "The Shadow Falls").  
  Lower number is dominant; tie means no dominant side.  
- **Perilous Locations**: Locations with permanent peril symbol or where influence exceeds hero’s Wisdom.  
- **Combat**:  
  - One-on-one between hero and monster/minion.  
  - Preparation: Sauron draws cards equal to combatant’s Fortitude; hero draws equal to Agility spent (unspent Agility grants +1 Strength).  
  - Rounds: Play cards facedown, reveal, resolve abilities (hero first), deal damage (simultaneously).  
  - Exhaustion: If cumulative card strength exceeds combatant’s Strength, they are exhausted (0 attack/defense).  
  - Resolution: Discard combat stacks; undefeated monsters allow Sauron to place influence.  
- **Defeated Hero**:  
  - Advance leftmost Sauron story marker (hero chooses in tie).  
  - Discard 1 Favor or Item.  
  - Move to closest Haven (Sauron chooses in tie).  
  - Shuffle rest and damage pools into life pool.  
  - Turn ends.  
- **Quests**: Completed during Explore step. Assigned to specific heroes. Removed when completed.  
- **Training**: Hero draws 2 Skill cards, chooses one to add to hand, discards the other.  
- **Corruption**: Gained via Dark Path or cards. Affects gameplay (e.g., Shadow cards trigger penalties).

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Finale Trigger**: When hero marker reaches Finale or all three Sauron markers reach "The Shadow Falls".  
- **Finale Steps**:  
  1. Check for Immediate Victory: Dominant side reveals mission; if fulfilled, wins. If neither dominant, both reveal; if only one fulfills, they win.  
  2. Advance Story Markers: Each side that fulfilled mission advances their marker.  
  3. Prepare: Fully heal all heroes and Ringwraiths; heroes draw new hands.  
  4. Adjust Difficulty:  
     - Sauron Dominant: Ringwraiths gain health and fortitude equal to hero marker’s distance from Finale.  
     - Heroes Dominant: Ringwraiths lose health and fortitude equal to Sauron’s dominance count.  
  5. Choose Champion: Heroes select one to fight Ringwraiths.  
  6. Combat: Normal combat rules apply.  
  7. Winner: If Ringwraiths defeated, heroes win; otherwise, Sauron wins.
