### 1. Lore & Objective
**Captain Hook:**  
Defeat Peter Pan at the Jolly Roger. To win, unlock Hangman’s Tree by playing the Never Land Map, move Peter Pan (who must be played immediately upon reveal) from Hangman’s Tree to Mermaid Lagoon, then to Skull Rock, and finally to the Jolly Roger, where he must be defeated.

**Maleficent:**  
Start your turn with a Curse at each location. The three Curses are Forest of Thorns, Green Fire, and Dreamless Sleep, each with unique effects and discard conditions.

**Prince John:**  
Start your turn with at least 20 Power. Accumulate Power through actions and cards, but be wary of Heroes like Robin Hood that reduce Power gain.

**Jafar:**  
Start your turn with the Magic Lamp at Sultan’s Palace and Genie under your control. Unlock Cave of Wonders with Scarab Pendant, play Magic Lamp to bring Genie into play, Hypnotize Genie, and move the Magic Lamp to Sultan’s Palace.

**Ursula:**  
Start your turn with the Trident and the Crown at Ursula’s Lair. Unlock The Palace via Changing Form, play the Trident (which brings King Triton), and defeat King Triton to return the Trident to your side. The Crown is played normally.

**Queen of Hearts:**  
Have at least one Wicket at each location and successfully take a shot. Convert Card Guards into Wickets using their Activated Ability, then play Take the Shot to reveal five cards from your deck; if their total Cost is less than the total Strength of your Wickets, you win.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Locked Locations:** Cannot be moved to, played to, or moved from. Cards already present remain in effect.
- **Playing vs Moving Cards:** "Playing" adds a card from hand or deck; "Moving" relocates an in-play card.
- **Revealing vs Looking:** "Reveal" shows to all; "Look" is private.
- **Finding a Hero:** Retrieve a specified Hero from Realm, discard pile, or deck.
- **Activated Abilities:** Use Activate action to trigger abilities on cards with the symbol. Pay Activation Cost if present.
- **Fate Actions:** Target an opponent, reveal two cards from their Fate deck, play one, discard the other.
- **Vanquish:** Defeat a Hero by matching or exceeding its Strength with Allies/Items at the same location. Discard all used cards.

**Villain-Specific Mechanics:**
- **Captain Hook:** Can access his own Fate deck via cards like Worthy Opponent to reveal Peter Pan.
- **Maleficent:** Curses affect Heroes at their location and are discarded under specific conditions.
- **Prince John:** Heroes like Robin Hood reduce Power gain; Steal from the Rich places Power on Heroes to reclaim when defeated.
- **Jafar:** Hypnotize defeats a Hero and treats it as an Ally under your control.
- **Ursula:** Binding Contracts defeat Heroes when moved to the specified location. Change Form toggles the Lock Token between The Palace and Ursula’s Lair.
- **Queen of Hearts:** Card Guards can be converted to Wickets (rotate 90°). Wickets cannot Vanquish but enable Take the Shot.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Never Land Map:** Unlocks Hangman’s Tree. Peter Pan cannot be moved until this is played.
- **Curses:** Can be moved with Move an Item or Ally. Multiple Curses can be at one location.
- **Dreamless Sleep:** Reduces Hero Strength by 2. Discarded when an Ally is *played* to the location (moving an Ally does not discard it).
- **Steal from the Rich:** Places 4 Power on a Hero. Reclaimed when Hero is defeated.
- **Binding Contracts:** Attached to a Hero. Hero is defeated when moved to the specified location.
- **Take the Shot:** Reveal top 5 cards of Villain deck. If total Cost < total Wicket Strength, win. Otherwise, discard and retry later.
- **Shrinking/Enlarging Heroes:** Shrunk Hero covers only one action; Enlarged Hero covers two at its location and one at adjacent.
