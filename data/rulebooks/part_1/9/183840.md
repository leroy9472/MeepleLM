## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
- Objective: Be the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game by constructing buildings, hiring assistants, and managing goods efficiently.  
- Victory Points are scored from buildings, assistants, and leftover goods (5 coins worth of goods = 1 VP).

2. Components  
- Worker tokens (1 per player)  
- Assistant tokens  
- Production building cards (including starting Charburner)  
- Resource and Good cards  
- Draw pile of cards featuring resources, half suns, and goods  
- Market Display area  
- Player hands and tableaus  

3. Setup  
- Each player receives:  
  - 1 Worker  
  - 1 random Charburner (starting building)  
  - 5 cards into hand  
  - 7 random building cards placed face down above Charburner (personal supply)  
- Place 4 (2 players), 6 (3 players), or 8 (4 players) random Assistant cards on the table.  
- Determine first Active Player: the player who most recently worked the hardest, or choose randomly.  
- Active Player begins with Phase 1.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of four phases:

**Phase 1: New Hand Cards**  
- Players choose to either:  
  - Keep all cards in hand, OR  
  - Discard all cards and draw an equal number from the draw pile.  
- The Active Player deals 2 cards to each player (including themselves).  
- There is no hand limit.

**Phase 2: Sunrise (Morning Market)**  
- Active Player reveals cards from the draw pile until exactly 2 Half Suns are visible (this forms the Morning Market).  
- All players simultaneously:  
  1. **Place Worker**: Assign Worker beneath one of their production buildings. Choose:  
     - *Working Efficiently*: Spend all required resources to produce 2 goods.  
     - *Working Sloppily*: Skip one required resource to produce 1 good.  
  2. **Move Assistant (Optional)**: Pay 2 coins to move one Assistant to a different building (free to leave in place).  
  3. **Set Aside Building (Optional)**: Place one building card from hand face down in front of them — this is the building they may attempt to build in Phase 4.

**Phase 3: Sunset (Afternoon Market)**  
- Active Player reveals cards from the draw pile until exactly 2 Half Suns are visible (this forms the Afternoon Market).  
- All revealed cards (Morning + Afternoon Markets) are available for resource use in Phase 4.

**Phase 4: Producing and Building (in turn order)**  
Starting with the Active Player and proceeding clockwise, each player takes a turn to:  
1. **Produce Goods**  
   - **With Worker**: Use resources from the Market Display or discard from hand to produce:  
     - 2 goods if working efficiently (all resources paid).  
     - 1 good if working sloppily (one resource skipped).  
   - **With each Assistant**: Spend all required resources (from Market or hand) to produce 1 good.  
   - Only one Worker or Assistant may be assigned per building.  
2. **Use Production Chains**  
   - For each building that produced at least 1 good this round, activate its Production Chain as many times as possible.  
   - Pay required input goods/resources (from hand or building outputs) to produce output goods.  
   - Market resources **cannot** be used for Production Chains.  
3. **Build or Hire (Optional)**  
   - **Build**: Discard goods with total value ≥ cost of the building set aside in Phase 2.  
     - If unable to pay, return the building card to hand.  
   - **Hire Assistant**: If player owns buildings matching the color requirements of an available Assistant, discard goods with total value ≥ Assistant’s cost.  
     - Immediately place the hired Assistant on one of their production buildings.

**End of Round**  
- Discard all cards in both Markets.  
- Next player clockwise becomes the Active Player.  
- Begin a new round with Phase 1.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Workers & Assistants**: Activate buildings for production. Only one per building.  
- **Resource Use**:  
  - Resources from Market Display or discarded from hand can be used for initial production.  
  - Resources from hand may only count toward one building.  
  - Each building may use any or all Market cards.  
- **Production Chains**:  
  - Can only be used by buildings that produced at least 1 good in Phase 4 (except in final round).  
  - Inputs must come from hand or existing goods on buildings.  
- **Building/Hiring**: Limited to one action per turn (build one building OR hire one assistant).  
- **Glassmaker Note**: Requires any 11 resources (of any type) to produce glass.  
- **Market Office**: Adds its depicted resource to the Market Display; can only be used to initiate production (not for Production Chains).

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End Trigger**: When any player has 8 buildings (including their Charburner), finish the current round.  
- Then, play **one additional complete round**.  
- **Final Round Special Rule**:  
  - Players may use the Production Chains of **all** their buildings, regardless of whether:  
    - The building was activated.  
    - The building produced anything.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - VP from buildings (as printed).  
  - VP from assistants (as printed).  
  - 1 VP for every 5 coins worth of remaining goods.  
- Highest total VP wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use Market resources for Production Chains?**  
  No. Only resources from hand or goods on buildings can be used.  
- **Can I produce with a building that has no Worker or Assistant?**  
  No, only activated buildings (with Worker or Assistant) can produce in Phase 4.  
- **Can I use a Production Chain if the building didn’t produce?**  
  Normally no — unless it’s the final round, where all buildings may use their chains.  
- **Can I place a building face down but not build it?**  
  Yes, but if you don’t pay the cost in Phase 4, return it to your hand.  
- **What happens if I can’t reveal 2 Half Suns due to insufficient cards?**  
  Shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile and continue.  
- **Can I move an Assistant without paying?**  
  Yes, but only to reposition freely during Phase 2 — moving to a different building costs 2 coins.  
- **Can I have more than one Assistant?**  
  Yes, but only one per building, and hiring is limited to one per turn.
