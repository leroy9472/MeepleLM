## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Diamant is an expedition game set in the perilous Tacora Cave, known for its diamonds and deadly traps. Players take on the roles of explorers seeking fortune, venturing into the cave to collect rubies and diamonds. The goal is to amass the most victory points by safely returning treasures to camp before falling victim to traps. Expeditions are risky—pushing deeper yields greater rewards, but encountering the same trap twice forces all remaining explorers to flee empty-handed.

The player with the most points at the end of five rounds wins. In case of a tie, tied players share the victory.

### 2. Components  
- **35 Expedition Cards**:
  - 15 Treasure cards (numbered 1–17 rubies)
  - 15 Trap cards (3 each of 5 types: snakes, scorpions, rockfalls, gas clouds, explosions)
  - 5 Relic cards (identical in value; timing of retrieval affects scoring)
- **Game Board**: Shows camp and 5 cave entrances (note: some editions omit the board)
- **16 Decision Cards**:
  - 8 Continue cards
  - 8 Exit cards
- **100 Precious Stones**:
  - 60 Rubies (value 1)
  - 40 Diamonds (value 5)
- **8 Explorer Figures** (in 8 player colors)
- **8 Chests** (in matching player colors)
- **5 Barricade Tiles** (numbered 1–5)
- **1 Rulebook**
- **1 Player Aid**

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board (if used) with camp at one end and 5 cave entrances in a row.
2. Place the barricade tiles on the corresponding cave entrances (1–5).
3. Shuffle the 35 Expedition Cards and place them face-down as a draw pile.
4. Place the rubies and diamonds in a shared reserve near the board.
5. Each player chooses a color and takes:
   - 1 Explorer figure
   - 1 Chest
   - 1 Continue card
   - 1 Exit card
6. Place each player’s Chest in front of them. Keep Explorer figures in hand until exiting.
7. The player closest to the draw pile becomes the starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each of the 5 rounds corresponds to one cave entrance. A round proceeds in turns until all players exit or a trap triggers.

#### Turn Sequence:
1. **Advance into the Cave**  
   The starting player reveals the top card of the Expedition deck:
   - **Treasure Card**: Distribute rubies from the reserve equally among all players still in the cave. Any remainder stays on the card.
   - **Trap Card**: If this trap has not appeared before in the round, nothing happens. If it is the second occurrence of the same trap, the round ends immediately—remaining players flee and lose all unsecured treasures.
   - **Relic Card**: Place the card on the path. No immediate effect.

2. **Players’ Decision Phase**  
   Before drawing a new card, all players still in the cave simultaneously choose:
   - **Continue**: Place Continue card face-down. Stay in the cave to seek more treasure.
   - **Exit**: Place Exit card face-down. Reveal and execute exit actions.

   All players reveal their cards at once.

   **Exiting Player(s) Do the Following**:
   - Move their Explorer figure to the camp.
   - Collect all rubies remaining on Treasure cards in the cave. If multiple players exit, divide these equally; any remainder stays on a card.
   - **Relic Rule**:
     - If **only one** player exits, they take **all Relic cards** in the cave.
     - If **multiple** players exit, **no one** takes relics.
   - Convert relics to diamonds:
     - First 3 relics taken: 5 rubies (1 diamond) each
     - Subsequent relics: 10 rubies (2 diamonds) each
   - Place collected rubies and diamonds (from relics) into their Chest (safe from loss).
   - May exchange 5 rubies for 1 diamond at any time.

3. **Next Turn**  
   If at least one player continues and no double trap occurred:
   - Repeat the cycle: reveal a new card, then decision phase.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Treasure Distribution**:
  - Rubies on Treasure cards are split equally among active players.
  - Remainder stays on the card for later retrieval.
- **Trap Mechanic**:
  - Each trap type appears 3 times in the deck.
  - First appearance: no effect.
  - Second appearance: round ends immediately. All remaining players lose unsecured treasures.
  - After triggering, one copy of the trap is removed from the game; the other is shuffled back.
- **Relic Mechanic**:
  - Relics remain in the cave until someone exits alone.
  - Only the sole exiting player can claim all relics.
  - Value depends on order of retrieval: first 3 = 1 diamond each; rest = 2 diamonds each.
- **Simultaneous Decision**:
  - Players use decision cards (Continue/Exit) to secretly commit.
  - All reveal simultaneously—no bluffing via hand signals in core rules (though older versions used closed fists).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after the 5th round (when the 5th barricade tile is placed).

**Scoring**:
- Count all rubies and diamonds in each player’s Chest.
- Count diamonds placed on Relic cards (these are safe).
- Convert rubies to diamonds as desired (5:1).
- Total score = (Rubies × 1) + (Diamonds × 5)

**Victory**:
- Highest score wins.
- In case of a tie, tied players share the victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I exchange rubies for diamonds during play?**  
  Yes. At any time, exchange 5 rubies for 1 diamond (or vice versa if needed, though not standard).

- **What happens to rubies left on Treasure cards when the round ends?**  
  - If the round ends due to **all players exiting**: rubies are divided among exiting players (if not already done).
  - If the round ends due to a **double trap**: rubies are returned to the reserve.

- **What happens to Relic cards if no one exits alone?**  
  All Relic cards still in the cave at the end of the round are removed from the game and lost.

- **What happens to the trap cards after a double trap?**  
  One of the two identical trap cards is removed from the game. The other is shuffled back into the deck.

- **Are relics cumulative across rounds?**  
  No. Relic cards are cleared from the cave at the end of each round if not taken. Each round has its own 5 Relic cards.

- **Can you return to a cave after exiting?**  
  No. Once a player exits, they remain in camp for the rest of the round.

- **Is the game playable without the board?**  
  Yes. Several editions omit the board. The 5 cave entrances can be represented by the barricade tiles alone.
