## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Specter Ops: Shadow of Babel*, one player controls an A.R.K. agent infiltrating Raxxon Global’s Facility 83X to sabotage their program. The other player(s) control Raxxon Hunters—enhanced operatives tasked with eliminating or preventing the agent’s escape.  

- **Agent Goal**: Complete 3 of 4 secret mission objectives and escape off the map via designated escape points within 40 turns.  
- **Hunter Goal**: Reduce the agent’s HP to 0 or prevent escape before turn 40.  

In a 5-player game, one hunter is a secret Traitor who aids the agent. Both agents must escape for a win unless the agent escapes alone before the Traitor is revealed.

2. Components  
- Game board (grid A1–W32) with buildings, roads, and objective zones  
- Agent Movement Sheet (tracks hidden movement)  
- Agent figure and character card (e.g., Spider, Blue Jay, Orangutan, CDBRA)  
- Hunter figures and character cards (e.g., The Beast, Prophet, Puppet)  
- Equipment cards (Flash Bang, Smoke Grenade, Adrenal Surge, Stealth Field, etc.)  
- Special ability cards (agent-specific)  
- Vehicle token (car)  
- "Last Seen" token  
- Stunned markers  
- Mission objective tokens (blue/red sides)  
- 1d6 die  

3. Setup  
**2–3 Players:**  
- One player is the Agent; others are Hunters (one player controls two Hunters in 2-player).  
- Place vehicle token at K17 with all Hunters inside.  
- Roll to determine locations of 4 mission objectives; place tokens blue side up. Agent circles them on their movement sheet.  
- Agent secretly selects 1 character and 3 equipment cards.  
- Hunters choose characters and take corresponding cards.  

**4 Players:**  
- Agent secretly rolls for objective locations but does **not** place tokens. Circles objectives on sheet.  
- Vehicle starts at K23. All Hunters begin in vehicle.  
- Agent selects 5 equipment cards and gains +2 HP (total 6 HP normally, 8 if Orangutan).  
- Add escape point at H1.  
- When an objective is completed, place token red side up at location.  

**5 Players:**  
- Same as 4-player setup, but with 4 Hunters.  
- Agent uses 5 equipment cards, +2 HP.  
- Vehicle starts at K23.  
- At end of setup, Agent distributes 4 secret role cards (one is Traitor). Each Hunter views their card privately.  
- Traitor remains hidden until revealed (see Traitor rules).  
- Additional escape point at H1.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Agent Turn**:  
   - Move 0–4 spaces (orthogonal or diagonal). Cannot move through Hunters or structures.  
   - Optionally use **1 equipment or special ability card** before or after movement.  
   - Mark movement secretly on movement sheet.  

2. **Hunter Turns**:  
   - Hunters take full turns in any order (one at a time).  
   - Each Hunter may:  
     - Move 0–4 spaces (orthogonal or diagonal).  
     - Use special ability.  
     - Attack (if agent is visible and in line of sight).  
   - After each Hunter completes movement, Agent checks visibility:  
     - If Agent ends turn in line of sight → reveal figure.  
     - If Agent passed through line of sight but not ended there → place "Last Seen" token.  
     - Else → announce "Clear."  

5. Core Mechanics  
**Line of Sight (LoS):**  
- Hunters see orthogonally (up/down/left/right) until blocked by buildings.  
- On roads: LoS extends along both lanes of the double-wide road.  
- Diagonal vision is **not** allowed.  
- LoS checked **after** each Hunter’s full movement.  

**Movement & Visibility:**  
- Agent moves secretly. Visibility only triggered at end of a Hunter’s turn.  
- Agent cannot move through Hunters. Must route around.  
- Entering/exiting vehicle uses full Hunter movement.  

**Combat:**  
- Hunter must have LoS to attack.  
- Distance = number of spaces (Manhattan or diagonal).  
- Roll 1d6: must roll **equal to or greater than distance** to hit.  
- Roll of **1** = automatic miss.  
- Roll of **6** = hit and roll again; add result (exploding dice).  
- If Hunter occupies same space as Agent → automatic hit (no roll).  
  - The Beast: on a 5+, Agent loses **2 HP** (Brutal Strength).  

**Equipment Cards (General):**  
- **Flash Bang**: Reveal card. Place token up to 4 spaces away. All Hunters with LoS to token lose vision until start of their next turn.  
- **Smoke Grenade**: Reveal card. Place token up to 4 spaces away. Blocks LoS within 1 space of token until end of Agent’s next turn. Movement unaffected.  
- **Adrenal Surge**: Do **not** reveal. Move up to 6 spaces this turn. Rotate card 90° to mark use. One use.  
- **Stealth Field**: Do **not** reveal. Agent only visible if within 2 spaces of a Hunter. Rotate card 90°. Lasts until start of next Agent turn.  

**Agent-Specific Abilities:**  
- **Spider – Tangle Line**: Reveal card. Target a Hunter with LoS. Roll d6; if ≥ distance, Hunter is stunned. Two uses (only successful attempts count). One card per game.  
- **Blue Jay – Holo Decoy**: Do **not** reveal. Place "Last Seen" token and Blue Jay figure within 4 spaces of real location. Mark round of use on movement sheet. If attacked at decoy, Agent may fake being hit (no damage). One use. One card per game.  
- **Orangutan – Power Fists**: Reveal card. Place Orangutan figure at current location. Stun all Hunters within 2 spaces. Two uses. One card per game.  
- **CDBRA – Velocity Blade**: Reveal when attacked. Hunters get **–3** to attack roll this turn. Two uses. One card per game.  

**Vehicle Rules:**  
- Moves up to 10 spaces per turn on road (orthogonal/diagonal).  
- Can be moved by any Hunter inside or remotely by Puppet.  
- Entering/exiting uses full movement.  
- Hunter in vehicle:  
  - Cannot attack.  
  - Cannot be stunned.  
  - Can use motion sensor at start of turn.  
- **Motion Sensor**: If Agent moved 3+ spaces last turn, must reveal cardinal direction (N, NE, etc.) relative to vehicle. If 0–2 spaces: "No motion detected." Sensor use prevents vehicle movement that turn.  
- Agent never uses vehicle.  

**Stunned Status:**  
- Stunned Hunter:  
  - Move max 2 spaces.  
  - Cannot attack.  
  - Cannot use special abilities.  
- Stunned marker removed at **end** of Hunter’s turn.  
- Cannot be stunned while in vehicle.  

**Traitor (5 Players):**  
- One Hunter is secretly allied with Agent. Agent knows who.  
- Traitor spotting Agent: **No obligation** to reveal or place "Last Seen" token.  
- If Agent becomes visible to another Hunter while Traitor had LoS → Traitor identity is revealed.  
- Traitor may **voluntarily reveal** at any time to become second Agent:  
  - Select unused Agent character.  
  - Gains 4 HP (6 if Orangutan).  
  - Draws 2 equipment cards from unused pool.  
  - Takes movement sheet and begins secret movement.  
- Both agents must escape to win (unless original Agent escapes before Traitor revealed).  
- If either agent dies → Hunters win.  
- Traitor may lie when using abilities (e.g., Beast sensing nearby agent).  
- Vehicle sensor detects direction of **both** agents; each must respond.  
- Prophet’s Post Cognition affects only one Agent per use.  
- Beast’s senses affect both agents.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Agent Wins**: Completes 3 of 4 objectives and **escapes** (moves off board at A3, N1, W3, or H1 in 4+/5-player) by end of turn 40.  
  - In 5-player: Win if Agent escapes **before** Traitor reveals, or if both agents escape.  
- **Hunter Wins**:  
  - Agent HP reduced to 0.  
  - Agent fails to complete 3 objectives and escape by turn 40.  
  - In 5-player: if either agent dies or fails to escape.
