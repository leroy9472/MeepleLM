## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Roman Republic is collapsing in a final power struggle between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great. Players take control of one of these two generals, deploying influence across the provinces of the Republic to gain control and dominance. The goal is to be the first to place your final Control marker—seizing the last vestige of power and becoming the first Dictator of Rome.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Game board showing the provinces of the late Roman Republic  
- 32 Basic Influence tokens (16 red for Caesar, 16 blue for Pompey)  
- 18 Province Bonus tokens (includes Senate, Might, Wealth, Tactics, Poison, Centurion)  
- 24 Control markers (12 per player)  
- 2 game bags (1 per player)  
- 2 player screens  
- Expansions of Rome components:  
  - 6 Centurion Influence tokens (3 per player)  
  - 6 additional Province Bonus tokens (3 Poison, 3 Centurion)  
  - 10 Command tiles for solo mode (8 standard + 2 expansion variants)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center of the table.  
2. Place a **Senate** Province Bonus token on the solid-border space in **Italia**.  
3. Randomly place one Province Bonus token (face up) on each remaining Province space, **except** the second space in Italia.  
4. Choose sides: one player as **Caesar (Red)**, the other as **Pompey (Blue)**.  
5. Each player:  
   - Places their 16 Influence tokens into their bag and shuffles.  
   - Draws 2 Influence tokens and places them secretly behind their screen.  
   - Places their 12 Control markers on their side of the board.  

**Expansion Setup Variants:**  
- **Poison Expansion**:  
  - Mix 3 Poison Bonus tokens with the other 18. Randomly remove 3 Bonus tokens from play before setup.  
  - Each player starts with 3 Influence tokens behind their screen (not 2).  
- **Centurions Expansion**:  
  - Mix 3 Centurion Bonus tokens with the others; remove 3 random Bonus tokens.  
  - Each player receives 3 Centurion Influence tokens in their color, placed **in front** of their screen.  
- **Border Control Expansion** (requires Poison and/or Centurions):  
  - Do **not** remove extra Bonus tokens. Place them face down beside the board.  
  - On any of the three double-lined Border Spaces, a player may place a token face down to draw and resolve a hidden Bonus token. That token exerts no influence.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players alternate turns, starting with **Caesar**. On your turn:

1. **Place an Influence token**  
   - Place one of your face-up Influence tokens on a **free Border Space** that matches the token’s icon.  
   - Choose orientation: assign each of the two adjacent provinces one of the two Influence values on the token.  
   - Wild tokens (laurel icon) can be placed on any Border Space.

2. **Check for Closed Provinces**  
   - If **all Border Spaces** around a Province are now occupied, the Province is **closed**.  
   - For **each closed Province**:  
     a. The player who **placed the last token** takes the Province Bonus token.  
     b. Total Influence values from each player around the Province.  
     c. The player with the **higher total** places a Control marker in the Province Space.  
     d. **Tie**: Space remains empty. No Control marker placed.  
     e. If the Province is **Italia**, the controlling player places a **second** Control marker on the dashed-space.  
     f. If the player controls **adjacent Provinces**, place an additional Control marker on the **shared Border Space**, covering any tokens there.  
     g. The player who took the Bonus token **resolves its effect immediately**.

3. **Draw a new Influence token**  
   - Draw one token from your bag and place it behind your screen.  
   - If your bag is empty, you skip this step.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

**Influence Tokens**  
- Each has an icon (matching Border Space type) and two Influence values (e.g., 5/1).  
- Wild tokens (laurel) can go on any Border Space.  
- Values are assigned to adjacent provinces based on orientation when placed.

**Province Bonus Token Effects**  
- **Poison [3]**: Return one of your opponent’s Influence tokens (from behind their screen) to their bag. Opponent chooses randomly if they have more than one.  
- **Centurion [3]**: Instead of drawing a token at the end of your turn, select one of your available Centurion tokens to add to your hand.  
- **Senate, Might, Wealth, Tactics**: No special effect—set aside when claimed.

**Ties in Control**  
- If Influence totals are equal, **no player** gains control. The space remains empty.

**Expansion Mechanics**  
- **Border Control**: On double-lined Border Spaces, you may place a token **face down**. You immediately draw and resolve a random face-down Bonus token. The placed token **does not** exert Influence.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends **immediately** when a player places their **last Control marker** (12th) on the board or under a Senate token.  
- That player **wins** the game.  
- There is **no final scoring**—victory is achieved by placing the final marker.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What if a player has no tokens to place?**  
  They must still take their turn. If they cannot legally place any token, they pass. However, the game usually ends before this occurs due to Control marker limit.

- **Can a player gain control of a Province they didn’t close?**  
  Yes. Control is determined solely by total Influence, regardless of who closed the Province.

- **What happens when a Province is closed but no one controls it (tie)?**  
  The space remains empty. The player who closed it still takes the Bonus token.

- **Can you place a token on a Border Space already covered by a Control marker?**  
  No. Only **free** Border Spaces can receive Influence tokens. Covered spaces are blocked.

- **Solo Mode – Auto-Crassus Tiebreakers:**  
  - **Between regions**:  
    1. Adjacent to already won regions  
    2. Gives Senate token  
    3. Gives Poison token (if playing Poison)  
    4. Land-locked regions  
    5. Adjacent to land-locked regions  
    6. Random  
  - **Between spaces in a region**:  
    1. Adjacent to region Auto-Crassus is losing the most  
    2. Adjacent to land-locked region  
    3. Random  
  - **Between tokens to place**:  
    1. Non-wildcard before wildcard  
    2. Highest or lowest combined value (as applicable)  
    3. Left-most in lineup  

- **Solo Mode – Auto-Crassus Turn Sequence**:  
  1. Draw a Command tile and follow instructions (Draw, Resolve, Discard).  
  2. Perform **Resolve** step:  
     - Auto-Crassus follows a priority list to place one token:  
       - Win a region with lowest possible token  
       - Close a region (even if losing it), unless doing so would cause player to win  
       - Reinforce region where losing the most  
       - Strengthen region where closest to winning  
       - Place in region adjacent to one already controlled  
       - Place in land-locked region (Italia preferred)  
       - Any remaining region  
     - Auto-Crassus **always wins ties** for control.  
     - If a Bonus token is claimed:  
       - Senate/Poison: resolve normally  
       - Might/Wealth/Tactics/Centurion: set aside (no effect)  
     - **Optional harder rule**: If Auto-Crassus wins a region with a Might/Wealth/Tactics token, remove one of their unused Control markers from the game.
