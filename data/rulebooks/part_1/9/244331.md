## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
As the chief of your tribe, you lead an expedition to explore and settle a newly discovered archipelago of 8 islands. The goal is to strategically place settlers and villages to collect resources, control islands, and establish connections between islands. The game is played over two phases—Exploration and Settlement—with scoring at the end of each. The player with the highest total score after both phases wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Game Board (featuring 8 islands and sea spaces)  
- 24 Wooden Resources:  
  - Coconuts (white)  
  - Bamboo (yellow)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Place all 24 Resources and 8 Statuettes into the Linen Bag. Shake to mix.  
3. Randomly draw and place one item (Resource or Statuette) on each island space marked with a stone circle (32 such spaces; only 32 items are used).  
4. Each player chooses a color and takes the following number of pieces:  
   - 2 players: All 30 Settlers and all 5 Villages

5. Place the Score Pad near the board.  
6. Determine the starting player (youngest player starts in Exploration Phase).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

#### **Phase 1: Exploration Phase**  
- Play proceeds clockwise starting with the youngest player.  
- On a turn, a player must place **one** piece (Settler or Village) on an unoccupied space. They choose one of two actions:  

**Option 1: Place a Boat-Side Settler in the Sea**  
- Place one Settler, boat-side up, on **any unoccupied sea space**.  
- No adjacency required.  
- Villages **cannot** be placed in the sea.  

**Option 2: Place a Piece on Land**  
- Place a Settler (land-side up) or Village on an **unoccupied land space**.  
- The space must be **adjacent** to a piece the player previously placed (Settler or Village, on land or sea).  

> **Note**:  
> - A space is unoccupied if it has no player piece, even if it contains a Resource or Statuette.  
> - When placing a piece on a space with a Resource or Statuette, the player collects it immediately.  
> - All collected items are kept visible (open information).  
> - Villages placed on stone circle spaces will be removed after this phase.  

#### **Ending the Exploration Phase**  
The phase ends when **either**:  
1. All **Resources** (coconuts, bamboo, water, precious stones) have been collected, **or**  
2. All players have placed all of their Settlers and Villages.  

> **Note**: Statuettes remaining on the board do **not** prevent the phase from ending.

---

#### **End of Exploration Phase: Scoring**  
All players score simultaneously:  

- **Islands**:  
  - 20 points if pieces on **all 8 islands**  
  - 10 points if pieces on **7 islands**  
  - 0 points for 6 or fewer  

- **Links**:  
  - Identify the longest **chain** of your pieces that connects islands (may branch).  
  - Score **5 points per island** connected by this chain.  

- **Majorities**:  
  - For each island, the player with the **most pieces** scores the points shown on the board (6, 8, or 10).  
  - In case of a tie, divide the points **evenly** among tied players (round down if necessary).  

- **Resources**:  
  - For **each resource type**, score:  
    - 2 matching: 5 points  
    - 3 matching: 10 points  
    - 4+ matching: 20 points  
  - **Complete Set Bonus**: 10 points for having **at least one of each** of the 4 resource types (scored only once).  

- **Statuettes**:  
  - 4 points per Statuette collected.  

Record all scores on the Score Pad.

#### **Prepare for Settlement Phase**  
1. **Remove all Settlers** from the board and return them to their owners.  
2. **Remove and discard** all Villages that are on **stone circle spaces**.  
3. **Leave** Villages on **non-stone-circle** land spaces.  
4. Collect **all remaining Resources and Statuettes** (from board and players).  
5. Place all 24 Resources and 8 Statuettes into the Linen Bag.  
6. Randomly draw and place one item on each stone circle space.  
7. Discard any **unused Villages** to the box.  
8. The player to the **left of the last player** in the Exploration Phase takes the first turn.

---

#### **Phase 2: Settlement Phase**  
- Players take turns placing **only Settlers** (Villages are no longer used).  
- On a turn, a player must place **one Settler** on an unoccupied space, choosing:  

**Option 1: Place a Boat-Side Settler in the Sea**  
- Only allowed if the sea space is **adjacent** to one of your existing pieces (Settler or Village).  

**Option 2: Place a Land-Side Settler on Land**  
- Only allowed if the land space is **adjacent** to one of your existing pieces (Settler or Village).  

> **Note**:  
> - All placements now require **adjacency** to your own piece.  
> - Placing on a Resource or Statuette allows you to collect it.  

#### **Ending the Settlement Phase**  
The phase ends when **either**:  
1. All **Resources** have been collected, **or**  
2. All players have placed all of their Settlers.  

---

#### **End of Settlement Phase: Scoring**  
Score using **the same rules** as the Exploration Phase:  

- **Islands**: 20 pts (8 islands), 10 pts (7 islands)  
- **Links**: 5 pts per island in longest connecting chain  
- **Majorities**: Most pieces per island score board value (6/8/10); ties split points  
- **Resources**:  
  - 2: 5 pts  
  - 3: 10 pts  
  - 4+: 20 pts (per type)  
  - All 4 types: 10 pts (once)  
- **Statuettes**: 4 pts each  

Add scores from both phases.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Total each player’s points from both phases.  
- The player with the **highest total score wins**.  

**Tiebreaker**:  
1. The tied player with the **most Resources and Statuettes combined** wins.  
2. If still tied, players **share the victory**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a Settler on a stone circle space?**  
  Yes, as long as it’s unoccupied and placement rules are followed. You collect the item on it.

- **What happens to Villages not placed during Exploration Phase?**  
  They are returned to the box and not used in the Settlement Phase.

- **Can a chain for "Links" score include sea Settlers?**  
  Yes. The chain can include land and sea pieces, as long as they are connected.

- **Do I need a Village to start placing in the Settlement Phase?**  
  No, but all new placements must be adjacent to one of your pieces (including sea Settlers or land Settlers placed earlier in this phase).

- **Are Statuettes considered Resources?**  
  No. Statuettes are separate. Only the 24 Resources (coconuts, bamboo, water, stones) count for resource scoring.

- **Can I score "All 4 Resources" more than once?**  
  No. The 10-point bonus for collecting all 4 types is scored **only once per phase**.

- **Are unused stone circle spaces reseeded in Settlement Phase?**  
  Yes. All 32 stone circle spaces get a randomly drawn Resource or Statuette, even if some were not used in the first phase.
