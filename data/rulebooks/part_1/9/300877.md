## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are zoo designers competing to be the first to completely fill their zoo’s construction area with enclosure and attraction tiles. The game ends immediately when a player fills all spaces on their board—this player wins.

### 2. Components  
- 8 double-sided Zoo Boards (player boards)  
- 1 Central Action Strip (with 15 bays and animal breeding lines)  
- 1 Elephant mover  
- Animal pieces:  
  - 28 Meerkats  
  - 26 Flamingos  
  - 24 Tree Kangaroos  
  - 24 Penguins  
  - 24 Arctic Foxes  
- Animal Houses (domed towers on player boards; 2 per player)  
- 45 Enclosure Tiles (green polyominoes in 4 shades):  
  - 8 × 4-space (lightest green, tetrominoes)  
  - 15 × 5-space (light green, pentominoes)  
  - 15 × 6-space (dark green, hexominoes)  
  - 7 × 7-space (darkest green, heptominoes)  
- 32 Attraction Tiles (beige polyominoes):  
  - 16 × 1-space (unlimited)  
  - 6 × 2-space  
  - 6 × 3-space  
  - 2 × 4-space  
  - 6 × 6-space  
  - 1 × 8-space  
- 1 White “?” Token (for test-fitting enclosures)  
- 5 Blue Range Markers (solo game only)  
- 3 Movement Tiles (solo game only)

### 3. Setup  
1. **Zoo Boards**: Select boards matching player count (indicated bottom-left). Assign boards clockwise starting with board #1 to the first player.  
2. **Starting Animals**: Each player takes the two animals shown at the top of their board and places one in each Animal House (domed tower).  
3. **Action Strip**: Place in center. Each of its 15 bays holds a stack of 3 Enclosure Tiles:  
   - Sort Enclosure Tiles by shade (lightest to darkest).  
   - Shuffle each shade group separately.  
   - Fill each bay with one tile from each group (lightest on bottom, darkest on top), as indicated by the icons.  
4. **Animals**: Place all animal types in a shared supply (unlimited; use substitutes if needed).  
5. **Elephant**: Place on the red starting circle.  
6. **Attractions**: Sort by size and place near the Action Strip. 1-space tiles are unlimited.  
7. **Short Game (2P only)**:  
   - Remove top tile from each bay.  
   - Deal 3 random 7-space and 3 random 6-space Enclosure Tiles to each player.  
   - Players simultaneously place all 6 tiles on their board (no animals yet).  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, complete these steps in order:  
1. **Move the Elephant**  
2. **Take a Main Action**  
3. **Resolve Animal Breeding (if applicable)**  

Play continues clockwise until a player fills their construction area.

#### 1. Move the Elephant  
- Move clockwise:  
  - 2 or 4 players: 1–4 spaces  
  - 3 or 5 players: 1–3 spaces  
- **Spaces counted**:  
  - Blue Animal Acquisition spaces  
  - Bays containing at least one Enclosure Tile  
- **Spaces not counted (skip)**:  
  - Empty bays (no Enclosure Tiles)  
  - Brown Animal Breeding lines  
- The Elephant cannot stop on a bay if the top Enclosure Tile cannot fit on the player’s board.

#### 2. Main Action  
Based on where the Elephant stops:

**A. Stop on Animal Acquisition (Blue) Space**  
- Take:  
  - Both animals shown, or  
  - One animal of any type  
- Place each acquired animal in:  
  - An empty Animal House, or  
  - An Enclosure of the same species (must be same species; enclosures cannot mix types)  
- For each animal placed in an Enclosure:  
  - You may move one additional animal of the same species from an Animal House into that Enclosure.  
- You may not add more than 2 animals total to a single Enclosure per action.  
- If no House or Enclosure can accept the animal(s), you must choose an Enclosure instead.

**B. Stop on Bay with Enclosure Tiles**  
- Take the topmost Enclosure Tile from that bay.  
- Place it on your construction area:  
  - Rotate or flip freely  
  - Must fit entirely within empty brown spaces  
  - Cannot overlap existing tiles or go off the board  
  - Use “?” token to test fit  
- Immediately add 1–2 animals of the same species to the new enclosure:  
  - From Animal Houses and/or existing enclosures  
  - Cannot remove the last animal from any existing enclosure  
- If you cannot place animals, you cannot take the tile—must move to an Animal Acquisition space instead.

**C. Scoring Full Enclosures (Any Time)**  
- Whenever an Enclosure is completely filled:  
  1. Remove all animals  
  2. If you have an empty Animal House, keep one animal there  
  3. Return the rest to supply  
  4. Take any available Attraction Tile and place it on your board (follows Puzzle Placement Rules)  
- This can occur during:  
  - Your Main Action  
  - Animal Breeding  
  - Opponent’s turn  
- If multiple players complete enclosures, resolve clockwise starting with active player.

#### 3. Animal Breeding  
Triggered if the Elephant **passes over** a brown Breeding line during movement.

- All players may breed the species shown on the line:  
  - For each player:  
    - In up to 2 enclosures with ≥2 animals of the breeding species, add 1 new animal  
    - For each new animal added, may move one of same species from an Animal House into that enclosure  
  - Breeding in both enclosures happens simultaneously; then check for full enclosures  
- **2–3 Player Bonus Breeding**:  
  - After normal breeding, if you bred at least one enclosure, you may breed one additional enclosure (any species, must have ≥2 animals)  
  - Apply same rules: add 1 animal, may move one from House  
  - Check for completed enclosures after bonus breeding  
- If multiple players complete their board during breeding:  
  - The player with the most animals wins  
  - If tied, all tied players win

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Puzzle Placement Rules**:  
  - Tiles may be rotated or flipped  
  - Do not need to be adjacent  
  - Cannot overlap or go off the board  
  - Once placed, cannot be moved  
- **Animal Movement Rules**:  
  - Animals can only be moved when:  
    - Placing into a new enclosure  
    - During animal acquisition (from House to Enclosure)  
    - During breeding (from House to breeding Enclosure)  
  - Never store animals outside Houses or Enclosures  
- **Enclosure Rules**:  
  - Each Enclosure holds only one species  
  - Each space holds exactly one animal  
  - Cannot empty an Enclosure when moving animals  
- **Attractions**:  
  - Unlocked by completing an Enclosure  
  - 1-space tiles are unlimited  
  - Placed like Enclosure Tiles (Puzzle Placement Rules)

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition**: First player to completely cover their construction area with Enclosure and Attraction tiles wins.  
- **End Triggers**:  
  - **During Main Action**: Active player wins immediately  
  - **During Animal Breeding**:  
    - If multiple players complete board, player with most animals wins  
    - If still tied, all tied players win  
- **Runner-Up**: Determined by fewest empty spaces; ties broken by most animals

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip placing an Enclosure if I can’t fit it?**  
  No—you cannot stop on a bay if the tile won’t fit. Choose a different move distance.  
- **Can I move animals freely between enclosures?**  
  No—only during specific actions (e.g., filling a new enclosure, after animal acquisition or breeding).  
- **What if I run out of a specific animal?**  
  Use substitutes—the supply is unlimited.  
- **Do I have to breed if I have eligible enclosures?**  
  No—breeding is optional per eligible enclosure.  
- **Can I complete multiple enclosures in one turn?**  
  Yes—each time an enclosure fills, immediately replace with an attraction.  
- **Can I use the “?” token on any bay?**  
  Yes—to reserve a bay while test-fitting a tile. Return it if you don’t take the tile.
