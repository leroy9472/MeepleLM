### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this sequence:

#### Turn Order  
Players take turns in order shown on the Turn Order Track.

#### On Your Turn, Perform These Actions in Order:
1. **Choose a Fleet Tile**  
   - Select one face-up Fleet tile.  
   - Place it on your mat and take the depicted boats (if available).  
   - You may use the Fleet tile’s special power once during your turn.

2. **Trade (Optional)**  
   - Buy or sell **one** boat (not gold).  
   - Pay or receive price as shown on your player mat.

3. **Place Boats (Optional)**  
   - First boat: must be placed on an empty starting spot **or** on an empty space adjacent to a boat of the same color already on the board.  
   - Subsequent boats: may be placed on any empty space connected to the previously placed boat (forming a chain).  
   - You may place zero or more boats.

4. **Collect Tokens or Build (Mandatory if Possible)**  
   Choose **one** of the following actions if eligible:
   
   a. **Collect Culture Tokens**  
   - For each boat you placed this turn, collect **one** culture token from an island adjacent to a boat you placed.  
   - You may collect from multiple islands as long as they are adjacent to your placed boats.

   b. **Construct a Building**  
   To build, all three conditions must be met:  
   - The island is empty (no building, no culture token).  
   - The island is adjacent to at least one boat you placed this turn.  
   - All boat types shown on the building tile must be adjacent to the island (regardless of who placed them).  

   - Choose one building from the face-up row.  
   - Place it in front of you (face down).  
   - Place a standard building (your color), Torii, or Palace on the island.

   **Standard Building Bonuses:**  
   - +1 VP if built on a mountain.  
   - +1 VP for each adjacent Torii or Palace.  
   - If the building creates or expands a group (2+ same-color buildings sharing edges), gain **1 coin per building** in the group.  
     - For Trading Posts: gain **2 coins per building** in the group.

5. **Store One Unused Boat (Mandatory)**  
   - If you have any boats left, you **must** store one in your harbor (on your mat).  
   - All other unused boats are scrapped (placed on mat, cannot be used again).  
   - Penalty at end: −1 VP per 2 scrapped boats.

6. **Recruit a Specialist (Optional)**  
   - Pay: 2 identical **or** 3 different Culture tokens.  
   - Take any coins on the Specialist tile.  
   - Add tile to your possessions.

#### End of Round
After all players have taken their turns:
- Add 2 coins to each remaining face-up Specialist tile.  
- Replenish Specialist row to 5 tiles.  
- Replenish Building row to 5 tiles.  
- Each player places their meeple(s) on the Turn Order Track spot(s) matching the number of the Fleet tile they used.  
- Slide remaining Fleet tiles left; flip next 5 to be face-up.  
- Collect all used Fleet tiles, shuffle, and refill rightmost 5 spots face-down.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Boat Placement**: Chains begin from starting edge or same-color connection; must be continuous.  
- **Building Requirements**: All boat types on the building tile must touch the target island (any player’s boats count).  
- **Group Formation**: Buildings of same color form a group if connected edge-to-edge (corner not sufficient).  
- **Scoring Bonuses**: Only apply to **standard** buildings (not prestige).  
- **Harbor & Scrapped Boats**: Harbor stores 1 boat per turn; excess are scrapped (penalty at end).  
- **Specialists & Buildings**: Always replenished to 5; oldest (leftmost/bottommost) are replaced first.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### End Game Triggers (Check at End of Round)  
Game ends immediately after the current round if any of the following occur:
- Any player places their last Standard building.  
- All boats of one color are removed from the supply.  
- Not enough Specialist tiles to refill to 5.  
- Not enough Building tiles to refill to 5.

#### Final Scoring  
Each player scores:
- VP from all constructed Building tiles  
- VP from all recruited Specialist tiles  
- 1 VP per Prestige token  
- 1 VP per 5 coins (round down)  
- −1 VP for each **Reserved Building** not built (via Fleet #2 ability)  
- −1 VP for every **2 scrapped boats** (round up)

#### Winning  
- Highest total VP wins.  
- Tiebreaker: Player who played earliest in the last round (lowest Fleet tile number used).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place no boats?**  
  Yes, but you cannot collect or build. You must still store one boat if any remain (if you had boats from fleet/trade). If you have none, skip step 4.

- **Can I use my harbor boat later?**  
  Yes — the stored boat is carried over to your next turn and can be placed then.

- **Do I lose VP for unused harbor boat?**  
  No — only scrapped boats (those not stored) count toward penalty.

- **Can I build without placing boats?**  
  No — you must place at least one boat to be eligible to build or collect.

- **Can I collect tokens without building?**  
  Yes — but only one of the two (collect or build) can be done per turn.

- **Are gold boats tradable?**  
  No — cannot be bought or sold.

- **What if I can’t meet building boat requirements?**  
  You cannot build that building, even if adjacent.

- **Do I have to use my fleet power?**  
  No — you may choose not to use it.
