## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Reef simulates the growth of coral reefs, one of nature’s most intricate and beautiful ecosystems. Players act as stewards of reef development, strategically placing coral pieces and scoring patterns to earn points. The objective is to collect the most points by growing your reef and completing patterns shown on cards.

### 3. Setup  
**Per Player Count:**  
- **2 players**: 18 coral pieces per color  
- **3 players**: 24 coral pieces per color  
- **4 players**: 28 coral pieces per color  
Return unused coral to the box.

**Per Player Setup:**  
1. Receive 3 × 1-point tokens (personal point stock).  
2. Draw 2 cards from shuffled deck (into hand).  
3. Randomly receive one player board (must include starfish board).  
4. Take 1 coral piece of each color.  
5. Place these 4 coral pieces:  
   - **Standard**: On the 4 central spaces of the board (any color order).  
   - **Advanced Variant (recommended for experienced players)**: On any spaces (including stacking), but **not** on the 4 central spaces.  
6. Leave space next to board for a face-up discard pile.

**Shared Setup:**  
- Place shuffled deck face-up in center.  
- Reveal top 3 cards to form **card display** (row of 3 face-up cards).  
- Player with **starfish board** is first player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds in rounds, clockwise, starting with first player.  
- Each player takes **one turn per round**, choosing **one** of two actions:  
  A. Take a card  
  B. Play a card  

#### A. Take a Card  
Choose **one** of:  
- **Take a card from the card display (3 face-up cards)**:  
  - Add it to your hand.  
  - Claim any point tokens on that card (add to personal stock).  
  - Refill display: Move top card from deck to display.  
- **Take top card from face-up deck**:  
  - Add it to your hand.  
  - **Must** place 1 × 1-point token from your stock onto the card in the display with the **lowest printed point value** (bottom-right number).  
  - In case of tie, choose which card receives the token.  
  - **Cannot take from deck if your point stock is empty.**

**Hand Limit Rule**: Maximum 4 cards. If you have 4 cards at the start of your turn, you **must** play a card (Action B).

#### B. Play a Card  
1. **Play Card**: Place one card from hand onto your discard pile.  
2. **Add Coral**:  
   - Take the **two coral pieces** shown on the **top** of the card.  
   - Place each on any space of your board:  
     - On empty spaces or on top of existing stacks.  
     - You may stack both on same space (in any order).  
   - **Stack Limit**: Max 4 pieces per stack. Cannot add to a stack of 4.  
   - If a color is depleted, take as many as available.  
3. **Score Pattern (Optional but encouraged)**:  
   - Use the **pattern on the bottom** of the card.  
   - Score based on how many times the pattern appears in your reef.  

**Pattern Scoring Rules**:  
- Only the **top piece** of each stack counts (top-down view).  
- Patterns can be rotated in **any 90° orientation**.  
- Each top piece can be used in **only one pattern instance** per scoring.  
- Pattern types:  
  - **Single Stack**: One piece of specified color/height.  
  - **Double Stack (orthogonal/diagonal)**: Two adjacent stacks (side or corner touching).  
  - **Triple Stack (L-shape, line)**: Three stacks in specific formation.  
  - **Square**: Four stacks forming a 2×2 square.  
  - **Wild Pieces**: Multi-colored symbol = any color; only height matters.  
  - **Height Requirements**:  
    - Number (e.g., "2") = exactly that height.  
    - Number with "+" (e.g., "2+") = that height or higher.  
    - No number = any height.  
  - **Special Pattern (8 cards)**:  
    - Example: "Score 2 points for each purple top adjacent to your highest yellow stack."  
    - In case of tie for highest, choose one.  
    - Only top piece color/height matters.  

**Scoring Calculation**:  
- If pattern appears **0 times**: score nothing.  
- If pattern appears **1 or more times**:  
  - Multiply number of completions by the **point value** (bottom-right of card).  
  - Take that many points into your personal stock.  

After playing, turn ends.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Economy**: Balance between acquiring cards (for future plays) and playing them (to grow and score).  
- **Spatial Strategy**: Placement affects future pattern opportunities.  
- **Hand Management**: Max 4 cards; forced to play at limit.  
- **Point Investment**: Paying 1-point tokens to draw from deck adds strategic cost.  
- **Pattern Recognition**: Requires spatial reasoning and forward planning.  
- **Stack Limit**: No stack may exceed 4 pieces.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger**:  
- When **any one color** of coral is **fully depleted**, the game ends **after all players have taken an equal number of turns** (i.e., after the current round completes).  
- **Rarely**: If the **card deck runs out**, the game ends **immediately** after the current round.  

**Final Scoring**:  
- Each player **scores remaining cards in hand**:  
  - For each card, check if its pattern appears in your reef.  
  - **Even if pattern appears multiple times, score it only once** (unlike during normal play).  
  - Do **not** take coral pieces.  
- Add all points to personal stock.  

**Winning**:  
- Player with **most points** wins.  
- **Tiebreakers (in order)**:  
  1. Most **covered spaces** on player board.  
  2. Most **stacks of 4 coral pieces**.  
  3. If still tied, **shared victory**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I place coral on any space, even if not adjacent to others?**  
  A: Yes. Placement is completely free, as long as stack limit is respected.  

- **Q: What if I can’t take both coral pieces when playing a card?**  
  A: Take as many as available. Proceed with scoring.  

- **Q: Can I rotate the card when checking for patterns?**  
  A: Yes. Patterns can be scored in any 90° rotation.  

- **Q: Can a single coral piece count in multiple patterns on the same card?**  
  A: No. Each top piece can only be used **once per pattern completion**. To score multiple instances, they must be disjoint.  

- **Q: What if I have no cards and can’t afford any in the display?**  
  A: You may still take a card from the deck **only if** you can pay 1 point. If you cannot (empty stock), and cannot take from display (no points to claim), you **must** play a card — but if hand is empty, this is impossible. However, the rules do **not** state you lose in multiplayer; you would be forced to take a card if possible. Only the solo rules specify losing in this case.  

- **Q: Can I exchange point tokens for different denominations?**  
  A: Yes. At any time, you may exchange tokens of equal value with the supply.  

- **Q: Are point tokens unlimited?**  
  A: Yes. Use substitutes if supply runs out.
