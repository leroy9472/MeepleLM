## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   - KeyForge is a unique two-player Living Card Game™ by Richard Garfield, where each deck is procedurally generated and one-of-a-kind. Players assume the role of Archons vying to forge the cosmic Key by being the first to forge three keys. Forging a key requires accumulating six Æmber and declaring the forge action during your turn.

2. **Components**  
   - Each player needs:  
     - A unique 36-card deck (House composition varies per deck)  
     - Identity card (represents the player’s Archon)  
     - 3 key tokens (one of each color: Red, Blue, and Green)  
     - Æmber pool (tracks Æmber collected)  
     - Damage and status tokens (e.g., poison, armor)  
     - Chain tracker (tracks current chain level)  
     - Discard pile  
     - Archive (facedown personal zone for stored cards)  

3. **Setup**  
   - Place all tokens and supplies in a common area.  
   - Each player places their identity card in their play area.  
   - Place three key tokens near the identity card, unforged side up.  
   - Randomly determine the first player.  
   - Each player shuffles their deck; opponent may cut or shuffle.  
   - First player draws 7 cards; second player draws 6.  
   - Mulligan Rule: Each player may mulligan once—shuffle their hand into the deck and draw a new hand with one fewer card.  
   - Chain tracker starts at 0.  

4. **Gameplay Flow (Turn Order)**  
   Each turn proceeds in the following steps:  
   1. **Forge a Key (if able)**  
      - If you have 6 or more Æmber, you may forge a key:  
        - Spend 6 Æmber from your pool.  
        - Flip one key token to its forged side.  
        - First player cannot forge on their very first turn.  
   2. **Choose a House**  
      - Select one of the three houses in your deck to activate.  
      - You may immediately retrieve all cards from your archive and add them to your hand.  
   3. **Main Phase (Active House Only)**  
      - You may play, use, or discard cards **only** from the active house, in any order.  
      - Actions include:  
        - **Play** a creature, artifact, or upgrade.  
        - **Reap** with a creature (exhaust it to gain 1 Æmber; triggers abilities).  
        - **Fight** with a creature (exhaust it to attack an opponent’s creature; both deal damage equal to power).  
        - **Use** an action card or card ability.  
        - **Discard** cards (e.g., to trigger discard effects).  
      - **First Turn Rule**: On the first player’s first turn, only **one** card may be played or discarded. Cannot be bypassed by card effects.  
      - **Alpha**: Cards with *Alpha* must be the first action in this step.  
      - **Omega**: Cards with *Omega* must be the last action in this step.  
   4. **Ready All Cards**  
      - Ready all exhausted cards (creatures, artifacts, etc.).  
   5. **Draw Phase**  
      - Draw cards to refill your hand to 6 cards.  
      - Adjust for **Chain**:  
        - Current chain determines how many fewer cards you draw:  
          - Chain 1–6: Draw 1 fewer  
          - Chain 7–12: Draw 2 fewer  
          - Chain 13–18: Draw 3 fewer  
          - Chain 19–24: Draw 4 fewer  
        - After drawing, reduce chain by 1 (minimum 0).  
      - If your deck is empty and you must draw, you lose the game.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Æmber**: Primary resource. Used to forge keys. Gained via reaping, stealing, or card effects.  
   - **Steal**: Take Æmber from opponent’s pool and add to your own.  
   - **Capture**: Take Æmber from opponent and place on your creature. When the creature leaves play, return Æmber to opponent.  
   - **Reap**: Exhaust a card to gain 1 Æmber. Triggers "on reap" abilities.  
   - **Fight**: Exhaust a creature to attack an opponent’s creature. Each deals damage equal to its power.  
   - **Keywords**:  
     - **Elusive**: First time attacked each turn, takes no damage.  
     - **Skirmish**: When attacking, takes no damage in return.  
     - **Poison**: Any damage dealt destroys the target creature.  
     - **Splash X**: Damage dealt also affects adjacent creatures (deal X damage to each).  
     - **Assault X**: Before fighting, deal X damage to defending creature.  
     - **Hazardous X**: Before fighting, deal X damage to attacking creature.  
     - **Deploy**: Creature may be played in any position in battleline.  
     - **Omni**: Ability can be used even if card is not in active house.  
     - **Archive**: Cards can be archived from hand. At start of step 2, player may take all archived cards into hand.  
     - **Purge**: Remove card from game and place faceup under identity card.  
     - **Flank**: Leftmost or rightmost creature in battleline.  
     - **Armor**: Prevents up to X damage per turn (resets each turn).  
     - **Exalt**: Place 1 Æmber from supply on a creature.  
     - **Enrage**: Place enrage counter on creature. During action phase, it must attack if able (removes one enrage counter per attack).  

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - The first player to forge **three keys** wins immediately.  
   - A player loses if they must draw a card from an empty deck.  
   - No alternate victory conditions; game ends as soon as third key is forged.  

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Can I forge a key on my first turn?**  
     No—the first player cannot forge on their very first turn, even with 6 Æmber.  
   - **Can I use Omni abilities on opponent’s turn?**  
     Yes, if the card with Omni is in your hand or in play, you may use its ability during any turn, but you must exhaust the card (if in play) to do so.  
   - **When is the archive cleared?**  
     Cards remain in archive until the active player chooses to take them during step 2 of their turn.  
   - **What happens to captured Æmber when creature is purged?**  
     When a creature with captured Æmber leaves play (including purge), return the Æmber to the opponent’s pool.  
   - **Can I have negative hand size due to chain?**  
     No. Minimum draw is 0. If chain would reduce hand size below 0, you simply draw no cards.  
   - **Do I have to use all actions in my main phase?**  
     No. You may pass at any time. The turn proceeds when you declare no further actions.
