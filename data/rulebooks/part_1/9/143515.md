## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Glück Auf* (Coal Baron), players are mine owners in early 20th-century Essen, competing to extract coal from deep shafts, fulfill specific orders, and deliver them via various transport methods. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) over three shifts (rounds) by delivering orders, achieving majorities in scoring categories, and efficiently managing resources.

The player with the highest VP total after final scoring wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most leftover Marks wins; if still tied, the victory is shared.

### 3. Setup
#### Player Setup
1. Each player chooses a color and receives:
   - 1 Pit (with matching lorry colors)
   - 1 Shaft Inlay (placed in pit center)
   - 1 Pit Cage (placed at Surface level)
   - 4 Coal Cubes (1 each of yellow, brown, gray, black) placed on corresponding lorries in their pit
   - Workers:
     - 2 players: 18 each
     - 3 players: 15 each
     - 4 players: 13 each
   - Starting Marks:
     - 2 players: 10
     - 3 players: 9
     - 4 players: 8
   - VP Marker placed on "0/100" of score track

2. Place workers in personal supply (left of pit).

#### Board Setup
1. **Lock Tiles** – Cover spaces based on player count:
   - 4 players: none
   - 3 players: cover all "2+3" marked spaces
   - 2 players: cover all "2" and all "2+3" marked spaces

2. **Tunnel Tiles** – Shuffle remaining tiles into face-down stack. Draw 1 tile and place face-up on each unlocked Lorry Factory space.

3. **Shift Hand & Scoring Marker** – Place Shift Hand on "I" of Shift Clock. Place Scoring Marker on leftmost circle (with arrow).

4. **Order Cards** – Shuffle into face-down stack. Reveal face-up cards below board:
   - 2 players: 7
   - 3 players: 10
   - 4 players: 13

5. **Card Draft**:
   - Starting Player chosen randomly.
   - Player to their right begins; counter-clockwise, each selects 1 card until all have 3.
   - Remaining card placed on one of 4 Order spaces.
   - Fill other unlocked Order spaces with cards from stack (2-player game leaves one space empty).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game consists of **3 Shifts (Rounds)**. A shift ends when all players have placed all their workers.

#### Turn Sequence
On a player’s turn:
1. Choose a Worker space on the board.
2. If occupied, remove all workers (any color) and send to **Canteen**.
3. Place **number of workers = (current workers on space) + 1**.
4. Perform the action.
5. If unable to act or unwilling, place 1 worker on **Bank** and gain 1 Mark.

Turns proceed clockwise until all workers are placed.

#### Worker Spaces & Actions
1. **Lorry Factory (Acquire Tunnel Tile)**
   - Pay cost based on lorry color:
     - Yellow: 1 Mark each
     - Brown: 2 Marks each
     - Gray: 3 Marks each
     - Black: 4 Marks each
   - Take tile, place matching coal on each lorry, add to pit at correct level and side (light/dark).
   - Refill empty space with top tile from stack.
   - *Special Action (top 5)*: Take top 5 tiles, choose 1, return rest to top/bottom in any order.

2. **Mining (Move Coal)**
   - Use up to N action points (space value).
   - 1 action = 1 of:
     - Move pit cage up/down to any level.
     - Move 1 coal from lorry to pit cage (cage capacity: 5).
     - Move 1 coal from pit cage to order spot (must match color).
     - Move 1 coal from pit cage to **Private Coal Storage** (unlimited).
     - Move 1 coal from storage to order.
   - **Substitution Rule**: 2 non-matching coal cubes can fulfill 1 order spot (costs 2 actions).
   - Once placed, coal on orders cannot be moved.

3. **Delivery**
   - Deliver **all completed orders** of the vehicle type shown.
   - Must have at least one completed order of that type.
   - Score VPs listed on cards.
   - Return coal to general supply.
   - Place delivered cards face-down in front of you.

4. **Money**
   - Gain Marks shown on space (3, 4, 5, or 6).
   - Can be used multiple times per shift.

5. **New Order**
   - Take the face-up order card below the space.
   - Add to Outstanding Orders (no limit).
   - Refill space with top card from stack.
   - *Special Action (top 5)*: Take top 5 order cards, secretly choose 1, return others to top/bottom.

6. **Bank (Last Resort)**
   - If no action possible/desired, place 1 worker here and gain 1 Mark.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Worker Placement**: Must place exactly (current workers + 1) to claim a space.
- **Escalation Cost**: Later actions cost more workers due to prior placements.
- **Canteen**: Holds displaced workers; no functional effect.
- **Coal Supply**: Limited; if depleted, cannot fulfill orders requiring that color (substitutions allowed).
- **Tunnel Balance**: Pit must have equal number of light/dark tunnel tiles. Imbalance costs 2 VP per excess tile.
- **Private Coal Storage**: Unlimited storage; coal here scores 1 VP per 3 cubes at game end.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### Shift Scoring (After Each Shift)
- Scoring depth increases:
  - Shift I: Score first 4 elements
  - Shift II: Score first 8 elements
  - Shift III: Score all 12 elements
- Scoring Marker advances from left to right; stop when it reaches Shift Hand.

**Scoring Categories**:

1–4. **Most Delivered by Color** (Order Spots):
- Yellow: 1st = 2 VP, 2nd = 1 VP
- Brown: 1st = 3 VP, 2nd = 1 VP
- Gray: 1st = 4 VP, 2nd = 2 VP
- Black: 1st = 5 VP, 2nd = 2 VP

5–8. **Most Delivered by Vehicle** (Total Order Spots):
- Barrow: 1st = 6 VP, 2nd = 3 VP
- Carriage: 1st = 7 VP, 2nd = 3 VP
- Motorcar: 1st = 8 VP, 2nd = 4 VP
- Engine: 1st = 9 VP, 2nd = 4 VP

9–12. **Most Empty Lorries by Color** (in Pit):
- Yellow: 1st = 10 VP, 2nd = 5 VP
- Brown: 1st = 11 VP, 2nd = 5 VP
- Gray: 1st = 12 VP, 2nd = 6 VP
- Black: 1st = 13 VP, 2nd = 6 VP

**Tie Rules**:
- 1st place tie: All tied get 1st VP; no 2nd place awarded.
- 2nd place tie: All tied get 2nd VP.
- **2-player rule**: Only 1st place awarded (no 2nd place VPs).

**Eligibility**: Must have delivered at least one order to score in a category.

#### End of Shift Cleanup
1. **Starting Player for Next Shift**: Player with most workers on Lorry Factory spaces.
   - Tie: clockwise from previous start player, nearest wins.
2. Reset Scoring Marker to leftmost circle.
3. Advance Shift Hand to next position (II or III).
4. Return all workers to supplies.
5. Keep delivered cards face-down (used for future scoring).

#### Final Scoring (After Shift III)
1. **Marks**: 1 VP per 5 Marks returned (leftovers are tiebreaker).
2. **Coal**: 1 VP per 3 cubes (any location: pit, cage, storage, orders).
3. **Undelivered Orders**: –1 VP each.
4. **Tunnel Imbalance**: –2 VP per tile excess (light vs. dark side).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I skip an action?**  
  Yes, but you must place 1 worker on the Bank and gain 1 Mark.

- **Can I place more than required on a space?**  
  No. Must place exactly (current workers + 1).

- **What if a stack runs out?**  
  - Tunnel tiles or order cards: spaces remain empty.
  - Coal cubes: substitute any color when acquiring tunnel tiles; cannot substitute for orders if supply is empty.

- **Can I move coal between order cards?**  
  No. Once placed, coal stays.

- **Can I deliver partial orders?**  
  No. Must deliver **all** completed orders of a given vehicle type when using Delivery action.

- **Does Private Coal Storage count for final scoring?**  
  Yes. All coal cubes anywhere count.

- **Can I use substitution during delivery?**  
  No. Substitution is only during **mining action** when placing coal on order spots.

- **What if no one has delivered in a category?**  
  No one scores for that category.

- **Are money and orders hidden?**  
  No. Money must be visible. Orders are public.
