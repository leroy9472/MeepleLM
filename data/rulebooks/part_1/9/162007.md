## Steampunk Rally - Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In the early 20th century, the world's greatest inventors race through the Swiss Alps in steam-powered contraptions of their own design. Using card drafting and dice placement, players build and pilot Rube Goldberg-style machines to generate motion, overcome terrain, and outmaneuver rivals. The goal is to be the first to cross the Finish Line and remain the furthest ahead after one final round.

### 2. Components
- 8 Double-Sided Track Tiles (Swiss Alps / Hoverdrome)
- 120 Machine Part Cards (Gold, Silver, Copper bordered)
- 40 Boost Cards (Black bordered)
- 32 Inventor Cards (16 Cockpits + 16 Machine Parts)
- 16 Inventor Pawns with Bases
- 8 Light Bulb Tokens ("On" / "Off")
- 8 Damage Gauges
- 36 Steam Dice (Red), 36 Heat Dice (Blue), 36 Electricity Dice (Yellow)
- 48 Cog Tokens
- 6 Challenge Tiles
- 1 Play Direction Token
- 8 Player Aids

### 3. Setup
1. **Racetrack**: Choose Swiss Alps or Hoverdrome side. Use 3 of 5 middle tiles to build a continuous track. Attach Start, Finish Line, and End Track tiles.
2. **Decks**: Sort Machine Part cards into Gold (Thrust), Silver (Power), Copper (Connection), and Black (Boost) decks. Shuffle each.
3. **Discards**: Flip one card from each deck to seed discard piles.
4. **Play Direction**: Flip token and place between two players.
5. **Players**:
   - Choose an Inventor; take matching Cockpit, Machine Part, and Pawn.
   - Place Pawn on Start.
   - Build starting Invention: connect Cockpit and Machine Part via complete valve connection.
   - Place Light Bulb token "On", Damage Gauge at "0".
6. **Optional**: Add up to 3 Challenge Tiles beside empty track spaces.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds simultaneously in five phases:
1. **Draft Phase**
2. **Vent Phase**
3. **Race Phase**
4. **Damage Phase**
5. **End of Round (Upkeep)**

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Draft Phase
- Each player draws 1 card from each of the 4 decks (4 cards total).
- Simultaneously:
  - Select one card and perform one action:
    - **Construct**: Attach Machine Part to Invention (must connect via valves).
    - **Generate Power**: Discard card for dice shown (upper-right).
    - **Gain Cogs**: Discard card for cogs shown (upper-right).
    - **Stash Boost**: Place Boost card face-down under Damage Gauge.
  - Pass remaining cards to next player in Play Direction.
- Repeat until all cards are drafted.
- If deck < players: shuffle discard into deck. If still insufficient, all players discard down to 4 cards of that color.

#### Vent Phase
- Spend Cogs to reduce die pips on Machine Parts:
  - 1 Cog = reduce up to 2 pips (e.g., one die by 2, or two dice by 1).
  - Dice reduced to 0 are discarded.
- Play Vent-Phase-Only Boost cards in Play Direction order.
- Optional: play regular Boost cards.

#### Race Phase
- Roll all dice in Dice Pool and diagonal Storage Slots.
- Spend Cogs during phase:
  - 1 Cog = re-roll one die.
  - 1 Cog = +1 pip to one die (max 6).
- Activate Machine Parts:
  - **With Die Slots**:
    - Place matching dice into empty slots.
    - Sum pips = activation power.
    - Divide by R (round down) = number of Race Effects triggered.
    - Must activate at least once (power ≥ R value).
  - **With Light Bulb Icon**:
    - Flip Light Bulb to "Off" to activate all such parts at once.
    - Resolve effects individually.
- Resolve all Race Effects immediately (no skipping).
- If cross Finish Line: next round is final.

#### Damage Phase
- If Damage Gauge < 0:
  - Discard Machine Parts = |Gauge value|.
  - Reset Gauge to 0.
- If forced to discard Cockpit: Invention explodes:
  - Move Pawn 1 space behind last place (ignore terrain).
  - Discard all Machine Parts except Cockpit.
  - Reset Damage Gauge to 0.

#### End of Round
- Flip Light Bulb to "On".
- Store one die from Dice Pool into each diagonal Storage Slot.
- Return unused dice to supply (keep Cogs).
- Flip Play Direction token.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- When any player crosses Finish Line: one final round is played.
- After final round, player furthest past Finish Line wins.
- **Tiebreaker**:
  1. Most Machine Parts remaining.
  2. Draw (forms bitter lifelong rivalry).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Building Rules**:
  - All Machine Parts must connect to Cockpit via complete valve connections.
  - Cards must be oriented with name in upper-left.
  - Rearranging allowed at any time; discard unconnected parts.
- **Terrain**:
  - Moving forward through terrain = take damage equal to icon.
  - Moving backward = no terrain damage.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Power Station/Coal Mine**: Spend 1 Cog to gain 1 die (any color).
  - **Rails**: Discard matching die to gain Motion (number of icons).
  - **Steam Pony**: Discard die to gain Cogs (once per game).
  - **Glaciers**: Discard die to ignore all terrain on tile.
  - **Jumps**: End phase on "Jump" space? Move back until not on Jump.
  - **Crowds**: Gain 5 Cogs – 1 per incomplete valve connection (min 0).
- **Running Out of Dice**:
  - Substitute with Cogs (1 per pip) or same-pip dice of other color.
  - Replace when possible.
- **Boost Cards**:
  - Play any time unless restricted.
  - Discard after use (unless effect lasts phase/round).
  - Resolve in Play Direction order if multiple played.
