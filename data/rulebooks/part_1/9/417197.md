## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Society lies in ruins, and clans across Scotland and Ireland compete to rebuild civilization by strategically placing settlements, farms, and infrastructure. In Scotland, players restore the land by establishing farms, settlements, and gaining control of castles and cathedrals. In Ireland, players revitalize the Emerald Isle by completing public missions, building offshore farms, and controlling castles and round towers. The goal in both versions is to score the most points through tile placement, mission completion, and territorial control.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, perform in order:

2. Score immediately based on tile type and placement.  
3. Draw 1 tile from your supply to your hand.  
Play proceeds clockwise.

5. Core Mechanics  

Tile Placement Rules:  
- Place on unoccupied space (no tile, not Castle, Cathedral, or Water).  
- Must match symbol:  
 • Settlement Tile → Settlement space  
 • Food Farm → Food space or blank  
 • Energy Farm → Energy space or blank  
- Exception: If no valid space exists for Food/Energy, may place on the other farm type’s space.

Scoring:  

Food/Energy Farms:  
- When placed, score 1 point per tile in the contiguous group of same-color, same-type tiles (including placed tile).  

Settlements (score when fully occupied):  
- Single-space: Score points equal to number of icons on tile.  
- Double-space: 5 pts for most influence, 3 pts for second. Tie: player who completed settlement loses. If one player occupies both, scores 8.  
- Triple-space: 8 pts / 5 pts. Tie: completer loses. If one player occupies all, scores 13.  
- Sprawling (4-space, Ireland only): 12 / 8 / 5 pts for 1st / 2nd / 3rd. Only 2 players: 17 / 8. One player all: 25. Tie: completer loses; further ties favor clockwise order.

Port (Scotland) / Offshore Farm (Ireland):  
- Score 1 point when placing a tile on a Port or Offshore Farm space.

Castles:  
- Gain control by having the most adjacent tiles.  
- Tiebreakers:  
 1. Most adjacent Food/Energy Farm tiles.  
 2. If still tied, current player loses.  
- Replace opponent’s castle if you gain control.

Cathedrals (Scotland only):  
- First time placing adjacent to a Cathedral space:  
 • Place your Cathedral there (stack if needed).  
 • Draw 1 Mission Card; keep face-down as Private Mission.  
- Only one Mission Card per Cathedral space (max 8).

Public Mission Cards (Ireland only):  
- When placing a tile, check if you complete any public mission.  
- First player to complete scores higher value; places Cathedral below it.  
- Subsequent players score lower value; place Cathedral below.  
- Each player may complete each mission only once.  
- Linking Castles/Towers: requires contiguous occupied spaces between them; the Castle/Tower hexes do not count.

Round Tower Bonuses (Ireland only):  
Triggered first time placing adjacent to a Round Tower:  
- Place a Second Tile (4x): Randomly draw 1 of 4 setup tiles from Clan Board; place it immediately.  
- Draw 3 Tiles (2x): After turn, draw 3 instead of 1; next turn choose 1, return 2 to supply.  
- Score 13 Points (3x): Score 13 if adjacent to all three such towers.  
- Doubling Markers (2x): When adjacent to both, place your Doubling Marker on an uncompleted Public Mission. If later completed, score double points.  
- Draw a Public Mission Card (1x): Take top card as Private Mission; score higher value if completed.  
- Score 3 Points (2x): Score 3 immediately.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends when all players have placed all tiles from their supply.  

Final Scoring:  
Scotland:  
- Incomplete Settlements: Score points equal to number of icons on each of your tiles in partially filled settlements.  
- Castles: 5 points per controlled Castle.  
- Private Mission Cards: Score points for completed missions.  
- Tiebreaker: Player controlling Edinburgh wins. If none, player controlling Stirling wins.

Ireland:  
- Incomplete Settlements & Castles: Same as Scotland.  
- Private Mission Cards: Score higher value for completed Private Missions.  
- Public Missions: Score points from completed Public Missions (higher or lower value as applicable).  
- Doubling: If Doubling Marker on completed mission, score double.  
- Tiebreaker: Player controlling Blarney Castle wins. If none, player with most tiles adjacent to Hill of Tara wins. If still tied, shared victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can you trigger multiple Round Tower bonuses in one turn? Yes, if adjacent to multiple different towers.  
- Can “Place a Second Tile” trigger another bonus? Yes, but you cannot use “Place a Second Tile” again if triggered by second tile.  
- Do blank spaces count for farm placement? Yes, for Food and Energy Farms only.  
- Can a player complete a Public Mission and a Private Mission on the same turn? Yes.  
- Do Cathedrals block tile placement? Yes; Cathedral spaces cannot be occupied.  
- Can you place a tile on a space with a yellow hex (setup tile)? No; those are permanent blockers.  
- Can you score a Public Mission after placing a second tile from a Round Tower? Yes, if the placement completes it.  
- What if no valid placement exists? Player must pass; but game assumes valid moves exist until end.
