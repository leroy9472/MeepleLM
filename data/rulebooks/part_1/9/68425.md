## Eminent Domain — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Eminent Domain is an empire-building card game set in a futuristic galaxy. Players expand their influence by surveying, colonizing, and researching planets, producing resources, and trading. The goal is to build the most powerful empire by accumulating the highest amount of Influence at the end of the game.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Central Card Display  
- 96 Role Cards (6 types: Survey, Colonize, Produce, Trade, Research, Warfare)  
- 27 Planet Cards (9 Advanced, 9 Fertile, 9 Metallic)  
- 6 Start Planet Tiles  
- 39 Technology Cards (Advanced, Fertile, Metallic)  
- 35 Fighter Tokens  
- 24 Resource Tokens (6 each of Food, Water, Iron, Silicon)

- 4 Player Aid Tiles (1 marked “Start Player”)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the Central Card Display and organize the 6 Role card stacks face up.  
2. Shuffle the Planet deck and place it near the display. Create a face-up discard pile.  
3. Place Technology cards in 3 face-up piles by type (Advanced, Fertile, Metallic).  
4. Place all tokens (Fighters, Resources, Influence) in supply pools.  
5. Each player receives:  
   - 1 Start Planet Tile (placed face up)  
   - A starting deck of 8 Role cards (1 of each type + 2 Politics)  
   - 5-card hand limit  
6. Shuffle decks and deal 5 cards to each player.  
7. Randomly determine the first player and give them the Start Player token.

*Optional Variants:*  
- **Learning Game**: Remove all Technology cards and 3 Advanced Research planets. Turn Research stack face down.  
- **Extended 3-Player Game**: Remove 2 of each Role card (1 Warfare). Game ends when Influence runs out OR any two Role stacks are exhausted.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has 3 phases:

#### 1. Action Phase (Optional)  
- Play 1 card from hand for its Action effect.  
- Actions cannot be Boosted or Followed.  
- Discard the card after resolution.  
- You may skip this phase.

#### 2. Role Phase (Mandatory)  
- Choose a Role from the Central Display (e.g., Survey, Colonize).  
- Take 1 card from that stack (if available) and place it in your play area.  
- **Boost** the role: Play any number of matching Role cards from hand.  
- Use symbols from face-up planets in your Empire to further Boost.  
- Resolve the Role effect, including Leader bonus.  
- **Opponents then choose**:  
  - **Follow**: Play matching symbols from hand or use planet symbols. Execute role effect (no Leader bonus).  
  - **Dissent**: Draw 1 card from deck.  
- *Note*: You can Follow without playing cards (use only planet symbols).  
- *Empty Stack Rule*: If a stack is empty, Trade, Produce, and Research gain enhanced Leader bonuses.

#### 3. Cleanup Phase (Mandatory)  
- Discard all played Role cards (except Colonies tucked under planets).  
- Discard any number of cards from hand.  
- Draw or discard to reach hand limit (base = 5).  
- Replenish deck from discard pile if empty.  
- Discard piles are open information.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Role Cards & Actions  
Each Role card has:  
- **Action** (used in Action Phase)

- **Leader Bonus** (only for Leader)

| Role        | Action | Role Effect | Leader Bonus |

| **Warfare** | Choose: Collect 1 Fighter OR Attack 1 Planet (return X Fighters, flip face-down planet) | Gain 1 Fighter per Warfare symbol | Attack 1 Planet instead of collecting Fighters |
| **Colonize** | Choose: +1 Colony (tuck card under planet) OR Settle 1 Planet (if Colony requirement met) | +1 Colony per Colonize symbol (tuck under planets) | Settle 1 Planet instead of adding Colonies |
| **Produce** | Add 1 Resource to empty slot | Add 1 Resource per Produce symbol to empty slots | After stack empty: +X Resources (shown on display) |
| **Trade**   | Return 1 Resource, gain 1 Influence | Return 1 Resource per Trade symbol, gain 1 Influence each | After stack empty: +X Influence (shown on display) |

#### Planet Cards  
- Start face down. Flip by **Settling** (Colonize) or **Attacking** (Warfare).  
- Face-up planets provide:  
  - Influence (for scoring)  
  - Symbols (used to Boost/Follow roles)  
  - Resource slots (store resources)  
  - Hand Limit +1 if marked  
- Colonize symbols in Empire reduce Settle cost by 1 per symbol.
