## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the roles of Mallorcan farmers cultivating and delivering tropical fruits—figs, lemons, oranges, grapes, and almonds (fish is also included as a resource). The island’s communities issue changing requests for goods, which players fulfill to earn victory points. The goal is to earn the most victory points by completing requests, claiming finca tiles, and using bonuses effectively. The game ends when the final wooden finca token is placed on the board.

1. **Place Board**: Position the game board centrally.
2. **Windmill Blades**: Shuffle the 12 windmill blades and place them face-up around the windmill.
3. **Request Tiles**:  
   - Shuffle all 42 request tiles face-down.  
   - Divide into 10 stacks of 4 tiles each.  
   - Place one stack in each of the 10 regions.  
   - Flip the top tile face-up in each stack.  
   - Return the 2 leftover tiles to the box without looking.
4. **Finca Tiles**: Randomly place one finca tile on the estate illustration in each region.
5. **Finca Tokens**: Place the appropriate number of wooden finca tokens next to the board based on player count.
6. **Donkey Carts**: Place the correct number of donkey cart cards near the windmill.
7. **Food Supply**: Sort all food tokens by type and place them in a general supply.

9. **Action Tiles (Advanced)**: Each player takes the 4 action tiles of their color.
10. **First Harvest (Intro Phase)**:  
    - Starting with the youngest player and proceeding clockwise, each player places one farmer at a time on any windmill blade and takes **1 food token** matching the blade's symbol.  
    - Repeat until all farmers are placed (each placement yields 1 food).  
    - There is no limit to how many farmers can occupy a single blade.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in clockwise turns after the First Harvest.

On your turn, you must take **one** of the following two actions:  
1. **Move a Farmer**  
2. **Make a Delivery**

You may **use one action tile** (Advanced Game) during your turn, before, during, or after your main action. Once used, the action tile is discarded.

Play continues until the **last wooden finca token is placed**, triggering the final round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Move a Farmer  
- Choose one of your farmers.  
- Move it **clockwise** a number of spaces equal to the **total number of farmers (all players)** on the blade you are leaving.  
  - Example: 3 total farmers on starting blade → move 3 spaces.  

#### Collecting Food Tokens  
- After movement, collect **1 food token per farmer (all players)** on the **destination blade**, all of the type shown on that blade.  
- Place collected food in your play area.  

#### Collecting Donkey Carts  
- If your movement passes **one or both** donkey icons (marked on windmill), take **1 donkey cart card per icon crossed**.  
- Exception: If no donkey carts remain in the supply:  
  - **All players return all donkey carts to the supply.**  
  - Then, you take the required number.  

#### Running Out of Food  
- If insufficient food tokens of a type are available:  
  - **All players return all tokens of that type to the supply.**  
  - Then, you take the amount you are entitled to.  

#### Make a Delivery  
To deliver:  
1. **Return one donkey cart card** to the supply (even if using Large Donkey Cart action).  
2. Deliver **up to 6 food tokens** total to **one or more communities**, fulfilling **exact requests** shown on face-up tiles.  
3. Return delivered food to the supply.  
4. Take the fulfilled request tile(s) and place in your play area (scoring points equal to the number shown on the tile).  
5. Flip the next tile from each fulfilled stack.  

> You may deliver to multiple communities in one turn, as long as total delivered foods ≤ 6 and you use only **1 donkey cart**.

#### Earning Finca Tiles  
When a player takes the **last request tile** from a community:  
- Award the **finca tile** for that region **immediately**.  
- Determine winner based on:  
  - **Single food**: Player who has delivered the most of that food (count values on collected request tiles).  
  - **Two foods**: Player with the highest **combined total** of both foods delivered.  
  - **Donkey symbol**: Player with the highest **total number of food items delivered** (sum all values on collected tiles).  
- **Tie**: No player receives the finca tile. Discard it. Place a wooden finca token on the community.  
- After awarding (or discarding), place a wooden finca token on the community.  

> Placing the **final wooden finca token ends the game**.

#### Action Tiles (Advanced Game)  
Each player has 4 unique action tiles. Only **one per turn** may be used. Discard after use.

- **Double Move**: After moving and collecting, take a second **Move a Farmer** action (same or different farmer).  
- **Gust of Wind**: Place one of your farmers on **any windmill blade**. Collect food as normal (based on number of farmers on destination blade). **No donkey cart** is collected, even if icons are "crossed."  
- **Large Donkey Cart**: Deliver up to **10 foods** in one turn (instead of 6). Still return **1 donkey cart** as normal.  
- **Resource Discount (One Fruit Less)**: Deliver **1 less of each food type required**.  
  - Example: Deliver 2 lemons for a 3-lemon request.  
  - Cannot fulfill a 1-food request with 0.  
  - You may deliver only 6 actual foods but complete requests totaling 7 points.  
  - Return 1 donkey cart as normal.

#### Bonus Tiles (Advanced Game)  
- First player to collect **six request tiles with values 1 through 6** (one of each) takes the **top bonus tile (7 points)**.  
- Next such player takes the next (6), and so on.  
- A player may earn **multiple bonus tiles** by completing multiple sets.  
- Place collected request tiles on the bonus tile to track completed sets.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends **immediately after placing the last wooden finca token**. The current player finishes their turn. Then scoring occurs.

**Victory Points from:**  
- **Request tiles collected**: Value shown at top (equals number of foods delivered).  
- **Finca tiles collected**: Each worth **5 points**.  
- **Unused action tiles**: Each worth **2 points**.  
- **Bonus tiles collected**: Score the **number in the center** (e.g., 7, 6, etc.).

**Total all points.** Highest score wins.

**Tiebreakers:**  
1. Most **food tokens in play area** (on hand).  
2. If still tied, **shared victory**.

> Note: If multiple fincas are awarded in the final turn but no wooden tokens remain, finca tiles are still awarded normally.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move a farmer already on the board during First Harvest?**  
  No. First Harvest is only for initial placement and taking 1 food each time.

- **Can I use more than one action tile per turn?**  
  No. Only one action tile may be used per turn.

- **Does Gust of Wind allow donkey cart collection?**  
  No. Since no movement occurs, no donkey icon is crossed.

- **Can I deliver 0 foods using Resource Discount?**  
  No. You must deliver at least 1 actual food. Cannot complete a 1-food request with 0.

- **What if I fulfill multiple communities and one runs out of tiles?**  
  Flip the next tile from each stack you completed. If a stack is empty, nothing is flipped.

- **Can I deliver more than 6 foods without Large Donkey Cart?**  
  No. Base limit is 6. Only Large Donkey Cart raises it to 10.

- **Do I return a donkey cart when using Large Donkey Cart?**  
  Yes. You still return one donkey cart card to the supply.

- **What happens if I trigger food/donkey reset during a multi-step action?**  
  Resolve the reset immediately: return all of that type, then continue.
