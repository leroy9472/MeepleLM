### 1. Lore & Objective
The game is set in the Warhammer Old World, where players command forces from one of six races divided into two factions: Order (Empire, Dwarf, High Elf) and Destruction (Chaos, Orc, Dark Elf). The objective is to burn two of the three sections of your opponent's capital by attacking their zones (Kingdom, Quest, or Battlefield). The first player to achieve this wins. Neutral cards, marked with grey borders, can be used by either faction unless otherwise specified.

### 2. Components
- Two player decks (50–100 cards each, maximum 3 copies of any card)
- Capital boards (one per player, race-specific)
- Resource tokens (barrels)
- Damage tokens (skulls)
- Burn tokens (flames)
- Card types: Unit, Tactic, Quest, Support, Legend
- Draft format cards (for draft variant)

### 3. Setup
1. **Choose Decks**: Players use either prebuilt decks (add 10 neutral cards) or constructed decks (50–100 cards, max 3 copies of any card). Draft variant uses separate Order and Destruction piles.
2. **Place Capital Boards**: Each player selects a capital board matching their faction.
3. **Token Pool**: Place resource, damage, and burn tokens in the center.
4. **Determine First Player**: Randomly select the starting player.
5. **Draw Hand**: Each player draws 7 cards. A single mulligan is allowed (shuffle and redraw 7).
6. **First Turn Rule**: The first player skips the Quest and Battlefield phases on their first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
A turn consists of five phases, taken in order:

#### 0. Beginning of the Turn
- Resolve "at the beginning of the turn" effects.
- Both players may take actions.

#### 1. Kingdom Phase
- Active player returns unused resources to the pool.
- Active player may restore one corrupted card (turn it upright).
- Active player gains 1 resource per power icon in their Kingdom zone (base 3 power from capital).
- Both players may take actions.

#### 2. Quest Phase
- Active player draws 1 card per power icon in their Quest zone (base 1 power from capital).
- Both players may take actions.

#### 3. Capital Phase
- Active player may play Unit, Support, or Quest cards from hand by paying their total cost (printed cost + loyalty cost).
  - **Loyalty Cost**: Number of loyalty icons on the card minus matching race symbols controlled (minimum 0). Capital board counts as one.
- Active player may play one card face down as a **Development** (adds 1 HP to the zone, no cost).
- Both players may take actions during this phase.

#### 4. Battlefield Phase
Combat occurs in five steps, with action windows after each:
1. **Declare Target**: Active player chooses which opponent zone (Kingdom, Quest, or Battlefield) to attack.
2. **Declare Attackers**: Active player chooses units in their Battlefield to attack. Only Battlefield units can attack.
3. **Declare Defenders**: Defending player chooses units in the attacked zone to defend.
4. **Assign Damage**:
   - Attacker assigns damage (sum of power icons) first: must destroy all defenders before assigning damage to capital.
   - Defender assigns damage to attackers.
   - Damage tokens are placed but not yet applied.
5. **Apply Damage**:
   - Apply effects like **Toughness** (cancels damage).
   - Apply remaining damage: units with damage ≥ HP are destroyed.
   - If a zone's damage ≥ HP (including Development HP), replace damage with a burn token.
   - If two zones are burning, the game ends.
- Both players may take actions after each step.

#### 5. End of Turn
- Turn ends. Other player becomes active player.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Unit Roles by Zone**:
  - **Kingdom**: Generate resources (1 per power icon).
  - **Quest**: Draw cards (1 per power icon).
  - **Battlefield**: Attack opponent's zones.
  - All units can defend their zone when attacked.
- **Power Icons**: Determine resource gain, card draw, or combat damage based on zone.
- **Hit Points (HP)**: Units are destroyed when damage ≥ HP. Zones start with 8 HP; each Development adds 1 HP.
- **Cost to Play**:
  - Total Cost = Printed Cost + Loyalty Cost.
  - Loyalty Cost = Loyalty Icons − Matching Race Symbols in play (min 0).
- **Questing**:
  - Play a unit on top of a quest card to quest.
  - Assign resource tokens (from pool) to the quest.
  - Only one unit per quest.
  - If the questing unit leaves, tokens are lost.
- **Corruption**:
  - Corrupted cards are turned 90° and cannot attack or defend.
  - Restore one corrupted card per turn during Kingdom Phase.
- **Keywords**:
  - **Counterstrike X**: When declared as defender, deals X uncancelable damage immediately.
  - **Toughness X**: Cancels X damage assigned (not uncancelable damage).
  - **Scout**: After combat, each surviving Scout unit forces opponent to discard 1 random card.
  - **Savage X**: When dealt damage and survives, deals X damage to a target unit in a corresponding zone.
  - **Necromancy**: Play unit from discard pile; if still in play at turn end, place on bottom of deck.
  - **Limited**: Only one Limited card per player per turn.
  - **Order/Destruction Only**: Deck restriction for neutral cards.
  - **Kingdom/Quest/Battlefield Only**: Zone restriction when entering play.
- **Actions & Timing**:
  - Actions can be taken by either player during action windows.
  - "In response" actions resolve before the triggering action (last in, first out).
  - Forced effects resolve immediately and cannot be interrupted.
- **Card Types**:
  - **Unit**: Soldiers, heroes, creatures.
  - **Tactic**: One-time effects, played from hand.
  - **Quest**: Long-term objectives with rewards.
  - **Support**: Buildings, attachments; remain in play until destroyed.
  - **Legend**: Powerful unique cards played directly to capital; only one per player.
- **Unique Cards**: Cannot have two copies in play; both players may have the same unique card.
- **Attachments**: Support cards attached to other cards; discarded if the host leaves play.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition**: First player to burn two of opponent's three capital zones wins.
- **Lose Condition**: A player with no cards in their deck is immediately eliminated.
- **Burn Mechanics**:
  - A zone burns when damage ≥ HP (base 8 + 1 per Development).
  - Replace all damage tokens with one burn token.
  - Burned zones still function but cannot take more damage.
- **Tiebreaker**: Not applicable; game ends immediately upon victory.
