### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round follows four phases:

2. **Upkeep Phase**
3. **Action Phase**
4. **Resolution Phase**

The game ends when all players die or after Round 8.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Stress & Hourglasses
- Stress track determines number of Hourglasses per round.
- Gaining Stress moves marker right; if it moves off the track, the player dies.
- Ways to gain Stress:
  - Reusing a board action with own Hourglass
  - Having >3 total Projects/Jobs/Partners
  - Having >1 Partner
  - Failing to pay upkeep
  - Taking Overtime action (+2 Stress)
  - Entering Old Age rounds
- Ways to reduce Stress:
  - Rest action (-2 Stress, same section)
  - Relax effect (-1 Stress, same section)
  - Good Health effect (-3 spaces, may cross sections)

#### Short-Term Happiness (STH)
- Affects Project costs: +1 STH reduces cost by 1 resource; -1 STH increases cost by 1 resource.
- At end of each round, all STH markers reset to 0.
- Can be used to refresh a card row (-1 STH to discard and replace all cards in a row).

#### Card Types
- **Projects**: Trade resources for rewards. Types:
  - *Basic*: 4 levels, advance at own pace.
  - *Single-Round*: Choose level, completed at end of round.
  - *Group*: Multiple roles, shared rewards.
- **Items/Activities**: Provide rewards for Coins. Items have upkeep costs.
- **Jobs**: Provide Coins in upkeep. Can be promoted. Only one job at a time.
- **Partners**: No cost to acquire, but require upkeep. Can be developed through levels.

#### Actions
- **Board Actions**: Study, Play, Interact, Temp Job, Take Project, Spend, Get Job, Start Relationship, Overtime, Rest.
- **Card Actions**: Advance Project, Upgrade Item/Repeat Activity, Get Promotion, Develop Relationship.
- Using an action space with own Hourglass already present gives +1 Stress (except Rest).
- Overtime grants 2 extra Hourglasses but +2 Stress.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends when all players have died or after Round 8.
Final scoring:
- **Inheritance**: 1 LTH for every 5 of the same resource type and every 5 Coins.
- **Life Goals**: Apply LTH bonuses. Only one player can claim each goal; ties result in no bonus.
- **Trends** (if used): Bonus LTH based on completed Projects in trending categories.
- **Mutual Friends** (if used): LTH based on cube position.
- **Experiences**: -1 LTH for each Desire token remaining on Dream board.
- **Nostalgia**: Score LTH from realized cards.
- **Community**: Score LTH based on Popularity.

The player with the most LTH wins. Ties broken by most total cards.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Dying during Action Phase**: Complete the action, then skip future turns. Still participate in Resolution Phase.
- **STH Limits**: If STH would go beyond ±3, stop at ±3 and gain/lose 1 LTH per excess.
- **Discarding Cards**: Anytime during Action Phase, discard a card for +1 Stress and -1 STH.
- **Old Age**: Round 6, 7, 8 trigger +3, +6, +9 Stress respectively.
- **First Player**: Determined by STH at end of round; tiebreaker is distance from current first player clockwise.
- **Group Projects**: Up to two roles per player; rewards scaled by number of roles and participants.
- **Dream Board**: Cards gain 1 Desire token per Upkeep Phase (max 3). Moving to play area grants 1 LTH per token. Unused tokens cost -1 LTH at game end.
