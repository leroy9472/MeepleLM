## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
You are a merchant trader in the 16th century, establishing trade routes and a colony across land and sea. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VPs) by acquiring Point cards, Bonus tiles, Exploration tiles, uncovering spaces on your player board, and holding non-yellow cubes.

### 2. Components
- Game boards (A2, B2, C1, D2, E2, F2)
- Point cards (with black star ⋆)
- Bonus tiles (25 total)
- Exploration tiles (10 total)
- Player boards (side B)
- Settlers (12 per player)
- Outposts (12 per player)
- Boats (1 per player)
- Market tiles (ginger, chili, tea, cloves; 3 of each)
- Sea tile
- Colored cubes (yellow, red, green, brown)
- Merchant cards (Spice Road)
- Merchant deck and discard pile
- Storage areas

### 3. Setup
1. **Build the Land Map**: Assemble boards A2, B2, C1, D2, E2, and F2 as shown.
2. **Assemble Point Card Row**: Remove all cards with a black star ⋆. In 3-player, remove "=4" cards; in 2-player, remove "3+" and "=4" cards. Shuffle remaining cards and place one face-up above each Fort location. Place the rest as a face-up draw deck.
3. **Place Bonus Tiles**: Shuffle all 25 Bonus tiles. Place stacks on each Bonus space matching the number indicated on the space (e.g., 3 tiles on a "3" space). Return one leftover tile to the box.
4. **Place Exploration Tiles**: Shuffle and place one tile face-up on each Exploration icon. In 2- or 3-player games, place one of the remaining tiles on each "2-3" marked location; return the spare tile to the box.
5. **Assemble Player Boards**: Each player takes a side B player board, ensuring the first-player symbol (●) is included. Shuffle and deal one to each player. The player with ● goes first.
6. **Assign Settlers**: Each player places 6 settlers on their board (7 in 2-player). The remaining 6 are set aside as a reserve.
7. **Set Up Island Map**: Place one Sea tile adjacent to the main board. Shuffle Market tiles and place 3 of each type (ginger, chili, tea, cloves) around the Sea tile, each touching at least two others.
8. **Place Boats and Outposts**: Each player places their Boat on the Sea tile and places one of their 12 Outposts on each numbered space of the Outpost section of their player board.
9. **Place Merchant Cards**: Remove all purple-framed starting cards. Shuffle the rest and place one face-up below each of the 4 Market locations. Place the rest as a face-down deck.
10. **Starting Cubes**: Assign cubes by turn order:
   - 1st: 3 yellow
   - 2nd: 4 yellow
   - 3rd: 4 yellow
   - 4th: 3 yellow, 1 red

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Play proceeds in rounds, starting with the first player and continuing clockwise.
- On your turn, choose one action:
  1. **Work**: Use a location by placing the required number of settlers.
  2. **Rest**: Return all settlers from the board to your player board.
- After your action, if you exceed your storage limit (10 cubes), discard down.
- Play continues until a player takes their 8th Point card.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Work Action
Choose a location without an Exploration tile or your settlers.

**New World Location Types**:
- **Production**: Gain cubes as shown.
- **Upgrade**: Upgrade cubes (yellow → red → green → brown) up to the number shown.
- **Trade**: Perform the trade shown (e.g., 2 yellow → 1 red) as many times as desired.
- **Fort**: Pay the cost to take the face-up Point card. No Bonus tiles are gained.

**Market Locations**:
- Use the Merchant card below the location: perform its action (spice, upgrade, or trade).
- Take the card and place it face-down in your discard pile.
- Slide remaining cards left and draw a new one to fill the gap.
- Every 4th Merchant card taken: gain the top Bonus tile from any stack on D2 (only) and place it on an empty Bonus space (max 4).

**Refresh Market Location**:
- Discard all 4 face-up Merchant cards to the bottom of the deck.
- Draw 4 new cards and place one under each Market.
- Take an additional turn immediately.

**Eastern Wonders Location Types**:
- **Move Boat Locations**:
  - Move 1 tile.
  - Move up to 2 tiles.
  - Move to any tile.
- After moving:
  - If sharing a tile with another Boat, pay them 1 cube (cannot move if unable).
  - Optionally build an Outpost on a Market tile: cost is 1 cube per existing Outpost (2 in 2-player).
    - Take the leftmost Outpost from the matching row.
    - If a column is emptied on your board, take the top Bonus tile from any stack on B2 or F2.
  - Perform the Market trade as many times as desired, regardless of Outpost ownership.

- **Boat Trade Location**: Perform the trade of the Market tile your Boat is on as many times as desired.

- **Outpost Trade Location**: Choose a Market tile where you have an Outpost and perform its trade as many times as desired.

#### Rest Action
Return all your settlers from the board (and trade route, if applicable) to your player board.

#### Storage Limit
Maximum of 10 cubes. At the end of your turn, discard excess cubes if needed.

#### Cube Supply
Unlimited; use substitutes if needed.

- **What happens when the Merchant deck runs out?** Shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.
