# Earth Reborn — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Earth Reborn is a tactical sci-fi skirmish game where players control squads of characters in a dystopian future. Scenarios vary, but core gameplay revolves around completing faction-specific objectives such as rescuing prisoners, capturing territory, or eliminating enemy forces.

Victory is determined by scenario-specific conditions. For example, in "Prison Break," the Coalition wins if Cherokee Bill exits the map, while the Enemy wins if Bill is killed.

- Command Point (CP) and Wound counters
- Equipment cards and markers (weapons, special items)
- Magnetic Card markers

- Search deck (equipment cards not in play)

### 3. Setup
1. Choose a scenario and build the map using floor tiles and doors as specified.

   - Player aid screen
   - Character cards (placed Healthy side up)
   - Corresponding miniatures
3. Position miniatures according to scenario instructions.
4. Place Order tiles in a cloth bag.
5. Place CP and Wound counters in a bank.
6. Shuffle remaining equipment cards into a Search deck (if Search is used).
7. Follow any additional scenario-specific setup steps (e.g., placing hidden markers in cells).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
#### Turn Sequence
1. **Initiative Phase**
   - Players draw Order tiles until they have 5 behind their screen.
   - Players receive CP: base CP (scenario-dependent) + bonus CP per controlled character.
   - Initiative marker is awarded per scenario (e.g., Salemite Player has it in "Prison Break").
   - Radio Scrambling markers are distributed if active.

2. **Activation Phase**
   - Players alternate taking rounds.
   - Each round, the active player chooses one action:
     - Activate a Character
     - Reactivate a previously activated character
     - Draw 1 Order Tile (1 CP)
     - Choose 1 Tile from Discard Pile (2 CP)
     - Pass
   - Activation ends when all players pass consecutively.

3. **Final Phase**
   - Check victory conditions.
   - Disengage character and equipment cards (rotate counterclockwise).
   - Discard all assigned Order tiles to a facedown pile.
   - Return all CP to the bank.
   - Discard excess Order tiles (max 5 kept).
   - Remove one time counter from all timed effects.
   - Power is restored if shut down.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Order Tiles
- 48 tiles total.
- Each tile has 4 order sections summing to 7.
- Distribution:
  - 25%: one 4, three 1s
  - 50%: one 3, one 2, two 1s
  - 25%: two 2s, two 1s
- SH (Shoot) appears on 96% of tiles (46/48).

#### Character Activation
- First activation: engage character card (rotate 90° clockwise).
- Options:
  - Assign one Order tile (max one per round)
  - Execute one or more orders (spend CP on order sections)
- CP Constraints:
  - Only empty sections may receive CP (except Move)
  - CP per section ≤ number shown
  - Total CP spent ≤ character’s Max CP/turn
- After all characters are engaged, reactivate one (card stays engaged).

#### Orders
- **Move**: CP spent = Movement Points (MVP) × Movement value.
  - MVP can be split or merged across sections.
  - Cannot pass through enemies, walls, or closed doors.
- **Close Combat**: Attack adjacent enemy or destroy floor element.
  - Combat Strength based on arc (dark blue = highest, grey = lowest).
  - Striking Hard: +1 die per CP > 1.
  - Critical hits inflict automatic wounds.
  - Normal hits exceed Armor to cause wounds.
- **Shoot**: Requires LoS and range check.
  - Improved Targeting: +1 yellow die per CP > 1 (max 4 CP total).
  - Pour It On: +1 yellow damage die per CP > 1 (max 4 CP total).
  - Out of Ammo: weapon must be reloaded (1 CP during activation).
- **Interact**: Trigger IPS abilities on equipment or floor elements.
  - Roll dice as specified; +1 die per CP > 1.
  - Threshold must be met.
- **Search**: On room tiles only.
  - SP = Search value + 1 black die per CP > 1.
  - Use SP to cycle through Search deck.
  - Take card if Room Type matches and SP ≥ Find Factor.
- **Combined Orders**: Multiple characters perform same order type.
  - Activated character uses any color; others use gold sections.
  - Minimum 1 CP per character.
  - Not allowed during interruption.

#### Dueling

- **For Interruption**: During Activation Phase if:
  - Enemy activated in LoS
  - Enemy enters LoS for first time
  - Enemy enters adjacent square in LoS
- Both players secretly bid CP; highest wins. Draw = no effect.
- Winner may:
  - Assign a new Order tile
  - Execute up to 2 red/gold orders

#### Special Mechanics
- **Radio Scrambling**: When active, attach markers to enemy characters.
  - If CP spent > CP Bonus, reveal marker:
    - Clear: no effect
    - Listening: scrambling player gains 1 SP
    - Scrambled: excess CP removed
- **Capture**: Attack wounded enemy; if damage would kill, capture instead.
  - Prisoner treated as equipment (weight 1).
