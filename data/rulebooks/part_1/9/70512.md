### 3. Setup
1. **Choose Start Player**: Randomly select a start player and give them the Start Player figure.
2. **Temple Island**: Assemble frame pieces. Place a number of Temple boards equal to the player count face-up starting from the Temple Gate; others face-down.
3. **Temple Tiles**: Remove tiles not matching face-up board colors. Randomly distribute tiles 1–4 among players. Each places their tile, a Novice, and a Book of Wisdom on the matching Temple space.
4. **Tile Path**: Place remaining Temple and Guard tiles around the Temple path: start with Guard tile 2, then highest-numbered Temple tiles (equal to player count), then next Guard tile, and so on in descending order.
5. **Guard of the Temple**: Place on Guard tile 6.
6. **Time Tokens**: Stack 4 (burning side up) in Meditation Room with "1" on bottom. In 2-player: remove top token (only 3 used).
7. **Council of Priests**: Players stack their Member of the Council pieces on the first space, starting with the start player on bottom.
8. **Holy Isles**: Place randomly (or in numbered order for preselected setup) around the Temple Island.
9. **Favor Tokens**: Place number of matching tokens equal to player count on each Holy Isle.
10. **Figures**:  
   - Moon Priestess: Use value "5" (2–3 players) or "6" (4 players).  
   - Place Moon Priestess, Master Builder, and Apostate on any Holy Isles (multiple allowed per Isle).  
11. **Player Pieces**:  
   - **Preselected Setup**: Skip Preliminary Round. Each player places 1 Shrine and 8 Novices as depicted. Receive 1 Favor token from each of the two Isles where they have no presence.  
   - **Standard Setup**:  
     - Each player places 1 Shrine on a different Holy Isle (2-player: cannot use Herbal Isle).  
     - Players take turns placing 4 sets of 2 Novices on Isles without their existing pieces.  
     - Each player receives 1 Favor token from each of the two Isles where they have no presence.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts 6 rounds. Each round consists of:
1. **Action Phase**: Players take turns performing one action until all Time tokens are turned.
2. **Scoring Phase**: Score influence based on Moon Priestess, Apostate, and Temple.
3. **Prepare Next Round**: Reset Novices, move figures, restack Time tokens (except after round 6).

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Novices**:
- **Active**: On a Holy Isle. Only active Novices can perform actions.
- **Inactive**: Placed next to a Holy Isle after taking an action.
- After an action involving Novices, involved Novices become inactive.

**Favor Tokens**:
- Return used tokens to their matching Isle.
- Maximum one of each type per player.

**Available Actions**:
- **Priest's Favor**: Use 2 Novices on a Holy Isle to gain its Favor token (1 if you have a Shrine there).
- **Recruit**: Use 2 Novices on a Holy Isle to place a 3rd Novice (from supply) there (now inactive).
- **Shrine**: Return a Shrine Favor and use 2 Novices on the Isle with the Master Builder to build a Shrine (max 1 per player per Isle).
- **Herbs**: Return an Herbal Favor to reactivate 1–2 inactive Novices on one Isle (cannot use on Herbal Isle).
- **Journey**: Move any number of active Novices to any Holy Isles; they become inactive.
- **Tide**: Return a Tidal Favor to move any number of active/inactive Novices (from any Isles or Landing stage) to any Isles; they remain inactive.
- **Sailboat**: Return a Sailboat Favor to move 1–2 active Novices from one Isle or Landing stage to another; they remain active.
- **Expulsion**: Use any number of Novices on the Apostate’s Isle to move him clockwise by that number of Isles.
- **Virtual Novice**: Return the Novice Favor to replace one active Novice during an action (cannot be used to claim Temple tiles or regain the Novice Favor).
- **Meditation**: Turn the top Time token (does not end your turn). Last player to turn a token gains 1 influence; next start player is to their left (opponent in 2-player).
- **Promotion**: Use 2 Novices from a matching Holy Isle to claim an approved Temple tile (between Guard and Landing). Deactivate one Novice. With Shrine: only 1 Novice needed. With Bribery: can claim unapproved tiles (between Guard and next Guard).
- **Sanctification**: Move a claimed and approved Temple tile and its Novice into the Temple. Gain influence equal to the current Guard tile value. Displace adjacent opponent Novices on lower-numbered tiles without Book of Wisdom (move to Landing stage; gain 1 influence per displaced Novice).
- **Book**: Return a Book of Wisdom Favor to take a Book from another Novice and place it under one of your Novices in the Temple (gain 1 influence; protects from displacement).
- **Council of Priests**: Use any number of Novices from one Isle to move your Council piece forward by that number. On last space: place on bottom of stack.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Scoring Phase (Each Round)**:
- **Moon Priestess**: On her Isle, count active Novices and Shrines. 1st place gains large value, 2nd and 3rd gain smaller values (3rd gets nothing in 3-player). Tiebreaker: Council of Priests position (farthest moved wins; top of stack if tied).
- **Apostate**: On his Isle, each player loses (number of their active + inactive Novices + 1) influence. No loss if no Novices present.
- **Temple**: Each player gains 1 influence per Novice in the Temple. Also gain 1 per Novice on a Book of Wisdom.

**Prepare Next Round**:
- Reactivate all inactive Novices (return to Isles).
- Moon Priestess and Master Builder move clockwise by their large printed number.
- Apostate moves clockwise to next Isle with at least one Novice.
- Guard of the Temple moves to next Guard tile; remove previous tile. When last Guard tile is reached, final round begins.
- Restack Time tokens as in setup.

**End Game (After Round 6)**:
- **Shrines**: 4 influence each.
- **Unused Favor tokens**: 1 influence each.
- **Council of Priests**: Influence based on final position (values on track).
- Total all influence. Highest wins. Tiebreaker: Council of Priests position.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Displacement**: Only occurs during Sanctification. Displaced Novices go to Landing stage. Can be retrieved via Tide, Sailboat, or Bribery (Sneak In).
- **Sneak In**: Use Bribery to place a displaced Novice on any empty Temple tile (no influence, no displacement).
- **Book of Wisdom**: Only protects from displacement. Books can be moved via Book action.
- **2-Player Rules**:  
  - 3 Time tokens.  
  - Cannot place Shrine on Herbal Isle in setup.  
  - Start player passes to opponent each round.  
  - First to use Book action in a round gains 2 influence (instead of 1).
- **Ties**: Always broken by Council of Priests position (top of stack if same space).
