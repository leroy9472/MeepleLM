## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In the realm of Monarch City, four enemy Generals—Gorgutt (Orcs), Balazarg (Demons), Sapphire (Dragonkin), and Varkolak (Undead)—lead their minions in a coordinated assault toward the capital. The land is being tainted and overrun, threatening the survival of the realm. Players take on the roles of heroic defenders, working cooperatively to defeat all four Generals before the realm falls.

**Objective:** Players win by defeating all four Generals. The King's Champion is determined among the victors based on completed Quests and Generals defeated.

**Losing Conditions:**
- Any General moves into Monarch City.
- Unable to place required minions due to insufficient supply.
- The 12th Tainted Crystal is placed on the board.
- Monarch City contains 5 enemy minions.

     - Balazarg: Scorpion Canyon (add 1 Tainted Crystal)
     - Sapphire: Blizzard Mountains

### 4. Gameplay Flow

- Draw 2 Hero Cards.
- Discard down to a maximum of 10 Hero Cards.

**Step 3 – Night (Enemy Turn)**
- Draw Darkness Spreads Cards based on War Status:
  - Early War: 1 card
  - Mid War: 2 cards (first for minions and general movement, second for general movement only)
  - Late War: 3 cards (first two for minions and movement, third for movement only)
- For each card:
  - Place minions as indicated on the top portion.
  - Advance the specified General if it is one space away from the shown location.
- Handle Overruns and Tainting (see Core Mechanics).

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Actions (1 per active Life Token):**
- **Move by Foot:** Move to an adjacent location.
- **Move by Horse:** Discard a Hero Card with a Horse icon to move 1–2 locations.
- **Move by Eagle:** Discard a Hero Card with an Eagle icon to move 1–4 locations.
- **Move by Magic Gate:**
  - Discard a Hero Card with a Magic Gate icon to move to the card’s location or any existing Magic Gate.
  - Move between any two Magic Gates (no card required).
- **Perform a Special Skill:** Use hero-specific abilities as described on the card.
- **Build a Magic Gate:** Discard a Hero Card matching your current location to place a Magic Gate token there.
- **Rumors at the Inn:** While at an Inn, spend 1 action to call a color, draw 2 cards, and keep matching color or Purple (Special) cards. Max 2 per turn.
- **Heal the Land:** On a Tainted location, discard a matching color Hero Card and roll 2 dice. Remove 1 Tainted Crystal on a 5+ on either die. Only 1 per action.
- **Healing Wounds:**
  - In Monarch City or Inns: Heal all wounds (all Life Tokens restored).
  - In other locations without minions: Heal 2 wounds.
- **Engage Minions in Combat:** Roll one die per minion (matching color). Hit on:
  - Orcs (Green): 3+
  - Undead (Black): 4+
  - Demons (Red): 4+
  - Dragonkin (Blue): 5+
- **Attack an Enemy General:** Requires no minions present.
  - Spend 1 action to initiate combat.
  - Play Hero Cards with the General’s portrait to determine dice.
  - Check General’s combat skill (e.g., Balazarg requires a corruption roll).
  - Roll dice; each hit advances the Wound Marker.
  - **Defeat:** Slayer gains General’s card (Slayer ability), all attackers gain 3 Hero Cards, advance War Status.
  - **Fail:** All attackers suffer General’s penalty (wounds, lost cards), are moved to Monarch City. General begins healing based on wound severity.

**Suffering Wounds:**
- End turn with minions: Lose 1 Life Token per minion.
- If Undead present: Lose 1 additional Life Token (Fear).
- Lose all Life Tokens: Choose a new Hero in Monarch City with 2 Hero Cards and 1 Quest Card.

**Overruns and Tainting:**
- 4th minion added to a location (or 3rd Demon) triggers:
  - Place a Tainted Crystal.
  - Add 1 minion of the same color to each adjacent location.
- If this would add a 4th minion to an adjacent location, only place a Tainted Crystal (no additional overrun).
- Inns and Monarch City cannot be overrun or tainted.
- Monarch City loses if 5 minions are present.

**War Status:**
- Starts in Early War (1 Darkness Spreads card per turn).
- Advances after each General defeat:
  - 1st defeat: Mid War (2 cards per turn).
  - 2nd defeat: Still Mid War.
  - 3rd defeat: Late War (3 cards per turn).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can you heal with minions present?** No. Healing requires location to be minion-free (except Monarch City/Inns).
- **Group Combat Order:** Active player determines attack order after seeing results.
- **Overrun from General Movement:** If General movement would add 4th minion, treat as overrun (taint location, spread minions).
- **Special (Purple) Cards:** Can be played at any time, even on another player’s turn, unless they require an action. Discarded from game when used.
- **Hero Death:** When all Life Tokens lost, choose new Hero in Monarch City with 2 Hero Cards and 1 Quest Card. All previous cards and rewards are lost.
- **Hand Limit:** Must discard down to 10 after drawing, even if gained cards from combat.
- **Varkolak’s Skill:** No re-rolls or special abilities (including Quest rewards) can be used against him.
- **Gorgutt’s Parry:** 1s rolled cancel hits. All players must roll even if General is slain mid-combat.
- **Balazarg’s Corruption:** Roll a die per red card committed; discard on a 1. Applies to Special Cards used in combat.
