# Tash-Kalar: Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Tash-Kalar is an ancient magical combat game played in arenas across the world. Players take on the role of summoners who use magical stones (kalarite) to summon fantastical beings and score points through strategic patterns and actions. The game features multiple forms, each with distinct objectives:
- **High Form**: Score points by completing tasks and having legendary pieces on the board.
- **Deathmatch Duel**: Score points by destroying opponent pieces, summoning legends, and benefiting from opponent's flares.
- **Deathmatch Melee**: Score points across opponent colors; final score is determined by the lowest-scoring color.

## 2. Components
- 1 Game Board (two sides: High Form with marked central squares, Deathmatch without)
- 4 Player Decks (Northern Imperial, Southern Imperial, Highland, Sylvan)
- Player Pieces (common, heroic, legendary) in 4 colors
- Shared Decks:
  - Deck of Flares
  - Deck of Legends
- Task Cards (Non-Advanced and Advanced)
- Score Boards:
  - Task Board (for High Form)
  - Duel Score Board (0–21, for Deathmatch Duel)
  - Individual Score Boards (for Deathmatch Melee)
- Discard Piles (for each deck)

## 3. Setup
### General Setup
- Place the board in the center. Use High Form side (with marked central squares) for High Form; use the other side for Deathmatch variants.
- Shuffle the Flare and Legend decks; place them near the board.
- Each player chooses a color and takes corresponding deck and pieces.
- Each player shuffles their deck.

### Team Play Setup
- Teammates sit opposite each other.
- Each teammate turns the bottom 6 cards of their deck sideways.
- Legends are shared: the earlier-playing teammate draws 2 legends at start.

### High Form Setup
- Set up the task board:
  - Shuffle task cards.
  - Reveal 3 non-advanced tasks. If all 3 are the same type (symbol in upper left), replace the third until a different type appears.
  - Reshuffle discarded tasks into the deck.
  - Reveal the top card of the deck as the "next task."

### Deathmatch Duel Setup
- Assemble the duel score board (0–21).
- Each player/team places a common piece on 0.
- The second player (or fourth in team play) places one common piece of each color on marked squares.

### Deathmatch Melee Setup
- Each player takes their colored score board.
- Each player places one heroic piece from each opponent on their score board’s 0 space (heroic side up).
- The player to the right of the starting player places 3 common pieces:
  - 3-player: one of each color, each adjacent to a different symbol.
  - 4-player: one of each color except the second player’s.

### Starting the Game
- Choose a starting player.
- Each player draws:
  - 3 beings from their deck
  - 2 legends (1 legend per team in team play)
  - 1 flare

## 4. Gameplay Flow
- Players take turns clockwise.
- **First turn**: Starting player has 1 action.
- **All other turns**: 2 actions per player.

### Actions (per turn)
1. **Place a Common Piece**:
   - Place one common piece on any empty square.
   - **Piece shortage**: If no common pieces are available, reclaim one of your common or heroic pieces and place it as a common piece.

2. **Summon a Being**:
   - Match the pattern on a card using your pieces on the board.
   - Patterns can be rotated (90°, 180°, 270°) or mirrored.
   - Higher-ranked pieces can substitute for lower-ranked ones in patterns.
   - Place a piece of the summoned being’s rank (shown in card’s upper-left corner) on the white-framed square in the pattern.
   - If the square is occupied by a piece of same or lower rank, destroy it.
   - If the square has a higher-ranked piece, summoning fails.
   - **Piece shortage rules**:
     - If the summon square has your needed piece type, use it (flip/replace as needed).
     - Otherwise, reclaim a non-pattern piece for use.
   - Resolve the being’s effect, then discard the card.

3. **Discard Action** (Full Game Only):
   - Can be used once per turn.
   - Discard one being from your deck.
   - Optionally return any number of other cards to the bottoms of their decks (in any order).
   - In team play, returned cards go sideways; top sideways card is straightened.

### Invoking a Flare
- Can be done before or after any action, but not during effect resolution.
- Must meet at least one criterion:
  - **Upper criterion**: Opponent has X more upgraded (heroic/legendary) pieces than you.
  - **Lower criterion**: Opponent has Y more total pieces than you.
- **Deathmatch Melee**: Choose one opponent to compare against.
- If both criteria are met, resolve upper effect first, then lower.
- After resolving, discard the flare.
- Draw a new flare at the end of your turn (if none held).

### Team Play: Passing Control
- Before any action or during effect resolution, pass control to teammate.
- Hand legends to teammate.
- Teammate finishes resolving any ongoing effect.
- Teammate must use all remaining actions to place common pieces only.
- Teammate cannot summon, discard, or invoke flares.
- You finish your turn (score, draw).

### Deathmatch Melee: Improvised Summoning
- Once per game per opponent color, use one enemy piece as your own in a summoning pattern.
- On your score board, flip the corresponding heroic piece to common side.
- The enemy piece remains enemy-colored and counts as enemy during effect resolution.
- Only one enemy piece per summoning.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Piece Ranks**:
  - Common (1 weapon): lowest
  - Heroic (2 crossed weapons): middle
  - Legendary (2 crossed weapons + helmet): highest
- **Moves**:
  - **Standard Move**: To empty square or square with lower-ranked piece (destroys it).
  - **Combat Move**: To empty square or square with same or lower-ranked piece.
  - Moves destroy pieces on landing square.
- **Leaps**:
  - **Standard Leap**: To any square with lower-ranked or empty piece.
  - **Combat Leap**: To any square except higher-ranked piece.
  - Leaps destroy only the landing piece.
- **Upgrading/Downgrading**:
  - Upgrade: Flip common → heroic; replace heroic → legendary (if available).
  - Downgrade: Flip heroic → common; replace legendary → heroic (if available).
- **Destroying/Converting**:
  - Destroy: Remove piece; return to owner.
  - Convert: Replace enemy piece with your piece of same rank.
  - Converting counts as destroying for scoring.
