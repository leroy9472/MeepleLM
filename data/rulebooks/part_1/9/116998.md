### 1. Lore & Objective
You are a heroic leader seeking the Thunderstones, ancient relics of evil power. Your goal is to assemble a party of adventurers, equip them with weapons and spells, and lead them into perilous dungeons to slay vile monsters. The ultimate objective is to defeat the Thunderstone Bearer — a powerful guardian of the relic — or prevent it from escaping to safety. Victory is determined by scoring the most Victory Points (VP) from cards in your possession when the game ends.

### 2. Components
- **Game Cards**: Five types:
  - **Basic Cards**: Regular, Longspear, Torch, Thunderstone Shard
  - **Hero Cards**: Adventurers with attack values and abilities
  - **Monster Cards**: Enemies in the dungeon with Health, XP, and effects
  - **Village Cards**: Resources like weapons, spells, villagers, and items
  - **Special Cards**: Curses, Familiars, Thunderstone Shards
- **Randomizer Cards**: Used during setup to randomly select monsters, heroes, and village cards
- **Dividers**: For organizing card collections
- **XP Tokens (Cyphers)**: Track experience points
- **Game Board**: Two-sided (Dungeon and Wilderness), showing dungeon hall ranks and village layout
- **Avatar Cards (optional)**: Represent player roles with leveling mechanics

### 3. Setup
1. **Sort Randomizers**: Separate into Random-Hero, Random-Village, and Random-Monster piles; shuffle each.
2. **Build Dungeon Deck**:
   - Draw one monster group each of Level 1, 2, and 3 (ignoring duplicates).
   - Collect matching non-randomizer monster cards and shuffle into the dungeon deck.
   - For Horde monsters (e.g., Soulstolen): Shuffle placeholder cards into the deck; create a separate face-up Horde Deck ordered by increasing Health.
   - Draw a Thunderstone Bearer; shuffle it into the bottom 10 cards of the dungeon deck.
3. **Populate Dungeon Hall**:
   - Reveal top cards to fill ranks: 3 ranks (Dungeon side) or 4 ranks (Wilderness side).
   - Ignore Raid and Breach effects during initial setup.
4. **Build Village Area**:
   - Place 3 copies per player of Basic Cards (Regular, Longspear, Torch) in designated slots.
   - Draw 4 Hero randomizers; place matching hero stacks with Level 1 on top.
   - Draw 8 Village randomizers (max 3 of any type, max 2 for Items); place corresponding stacks.
5. **Other Setup**:
   - Shuffle Curse and Familiar decks; place near board.
   - Place XP tokens nearby.
   - Each player builds a Basic Deck: 6 Regular, 2 Longspear, 2 Torch, 2 Thunderstone Shard; shuffle and place face-down.
   - Each player draws 6 cards for starting hand.
6. **Determine Starting Player**: Randomly chosen; play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

#### Visit the Village
1. Reveal all cards in hand.
2. Use any Village abilities (optional) and all Trophy effects (mandatory), in any order.
3. Calculate total gold value from revealed cards; buy **one** hero, village, or basic card.
4. Spend XP to level up one or more heroes in hand (optional).

1. Reveal all cards in hand.
2. Use Dungeon abilities (optional), equip weapons (optional), and use all Trophy effects (mandatory), in any order.

4. Resolve Battle effects.
5. Calculate Total Attack Value (TAV):
   - Sum Physical and Magic Attack from cards, abilities, and effects.

6. Compare TAV to monster’s Health:
   - **If TAV ≥ Health**: Defeat monster.
     - Apply Aftermath effects.
     - Add monster to discard pile.
     - Gain XP equal to monster’s XP value.
     - Use Spoils abilities (if any).
   - **If TAV < Health**: Monster retreats to bottom of dungeon deck.
7. Refill dungeon hall:
   - Shift monsters forward to fill empty ranks.
   - Draw new cards to refill empty ranks from lowest to highest.
8. Resolve Raid effects (on newly revealed monsters) and Breach effects (on monsters entering Rank 1).

#### Prepare
- Place any number of cards from hand on top of deck, in any order.
- Discard the rest and draw 6 new cards.

#### Rest
- Choose and destroy one card from hand.
- Discard the rest and draw 6 new cards.

#### End of Turn
- If a Familiar’s ability was used, move it to discard pile.
- Discard all remaining cards.
- Draw 6 new cards.
- If deck is empty and draw is needed, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Deckbuilding**: Players customize their personal decks over time by buying cards and leveling up heroes.
- **Gold and Buying**:
  - Gold value comes from card icons (top-left).
  - Only one purchase per turn unless Spoils or other effects allow more.
  - Cannot save gold between turns.
- **Leveling Up**:
  - Pay XP to destroy a hero and replace it with next-level version from stack.
  - Regulars (Level 0) cost 2 XP to level up into any Level 1 hero.
  - Cannot skip levels or level same hero twice per turn.
- **Combat**:
  - **Total Attack Value (TAV)** = Physical Attack + Magic Attack + Bonuses – Net Darkness.
  - **Darkness**: Base value = monster’s rank. Reduced by Light from cards.
  - **Weapons**: Must be equipped to a hero with Strength ≥ weapon’s Weight. Only one weapon per hero per turn.
  - **Battle Effects**: Trigger after selecting monster, before combat resolution.
  - **Aftermath Effects**: Trigger after combat, regardless of outcome.
  - **Spoils**: Used only if victorious; may allow additional purchases or actions.
- **Abilities**:
  - **Village/Dungeon/React/Spoils**: Identified by keyword + colon.
  - **Repeat**: Can be used multiple times if cost is paid each time.
  - **React**: Can be used on any player’s turn when trigger condition is met.
- **Familiars**:
  - Acquired once per game via Spoils.
  - Must have unspent XP ≥ ability’s cost to use it.
  - Discard familiar at end of turn if ability was used.
  - Return to hand at start of future turns.
- **Curses**:
  - Gained through effects; placed in discard pile.
  - Destroyed curses go to bottom of curse deck.
- **Horde Monsters**:
  - Use placeholder cards in dungeon deck.
  - When revealed, replace with top card from Horde Deck (increasing difficulty).
- **Global Effects**: Always active while monster is in dungeon hall; stack with duplicates.
- **Guardians**:
  - Immune to effects that move or remove them from dungeon hall.
  - Thunderstone Bearer cannot be defeated if another Guardian remains.
- **Traits**:
  - Always active (e.g., Immune to X, Darkness +1).
  - "Immune" reduces relevant Attack to zero.
  - "Cannot Be Fought Unless" requires specified condition to attack.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends at the end of a player’s turn when:
- The active player defeats the Thunderstone Bearer, OR
- The Thunderstone Bearer reaches Rank 1 of the dungeon hall.

**Scoring**:
- All players sum Victory Points (VP) from cards in hand, deck, and discard pile.
- VP is shown in blue jewel icon on cards.

**Winning**:
- Player with most VP wins.
- Tiebreaker 1: Player who possesses the Thunderstone Bearer.
- Tiebreaker 2: Player with most XP.
