### 4. Gameplay Flow  

Each turn has **3 phases**:

#### Phase 1: Play or Discard a Card  
- **Play a Location card:**  
  - Must **not** share any symbol with the previously played card.  
  - If it is the **third card of the same color** in a row, gain the matching Door:  
    - Search the deck, take the Door, shuffle the deck.  

- **Discard a card:**  
  - **Sun or Moon:** Proceed to Phase 2.  
  - **Key:** Perform a **Prophecy**:  
    - Look at top 5 cards of deck.  
    - Discard one, return the rest to the top in any order.  
  - **Glyph card (expansion):** Triggers **Incantation**:  
    - Reveal top 5 cards.  
    - If a Door is among them, place one on the table; return the rest to the bottom in any order.  
    - If no Door, return all to bottom.  
  - **Tower card (expansion):** When discarded, look at top 3/4/5 cards (based on icon), return in any order.  
  - **Crossroad (expansion):** Can be discarded normally; counts as Key for Door acquisition.  

#### Phase 2: Fill Your Hand  
Draw until you have 5 cards (3 in 2-player). Resolve any Dream cards drawn:  
- **Nightmare / Denizen / Lost Dream / Happy Dream:** Resolve immediately, then discard.  
  - Choose one of:  
    1. Discard a Key.  
    2. Place a gained Door in Limbo.  
    3. Discard top 5 cards of deck (Doors and Dreams go to Limbo).  
    4. Discard entire hand, draw 5 new Location cards (setup style).  
- **Door card:** Place in Limbo.  
  - You may discard a **Key of matching color** to gain the Door immediately.  
- **Dead End (expansion):** Cannot be discarded individually; must discard entire hand to remove.  
- **Happy Dream (expansion):** Discard, then choose:  
  1. Remove a face-up Dark Premonition.  
  2. Reveal top 7 cards, discard any, return rest to top in chosen order.  
  3. Take any card from deck, shuffle, place on top.  

#### Phase 3: Shuffle Limbo Pile  
- If Limbo pile is not empty, shuffle it back into the deck.  
- In **Dreamcatchers expansion**, Limbo cards are moved to Dreamcatchers instead unless freed.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Symbol Matching Rule  
- Cannot play a card with **any symbol in common** with the last played card.  
- Exception: **The Architect** allows playing a card with a matching symbol.

#### Door Acquisition  
- Play 3 cards of the same color in a row (no symbol match between consecutive cards).  
- Retrieve matching Door from deck, shuffle deck.  
- If Door is not needed (e.g., due to Goal order), place in Limbo.

#### Prophecy  
- Discard a Key to:  
  - View top 5 cards.  
  - Discard one, return others to top in any order.  
- **The Squirrel Spies (Denizen):** Same effect.

#### Nightmare Effects  
When drawing a Nightmare, choose one:  
- Discard a Key.  
- Place a gained Door in Limbo.  
- Discard top 5 cards (Doors/Dreams to Limbo).  
- Discard hand, draw 5 new Location cards.  

**Special Rules:**  
- **The Mirror (Denizen):** Put Nightmare into Limbo without resolving.  
- **Powerful Punishment (Spell):** Discard drawn Nightmare without effect.  
- **The Harpoon Hunter (Denizen):** Reveal top 5, discard all Nightmares, return rest to bottom.  

#### Expansion Mechanics  
- **The Towers:**  
  - Played in separate row. Adjacent Towers must not share symbols on connecting sides.  
  - After Nightmare, must discard a Tower (if possible).  
  - After collecting one of each color, Towers are immune to Nightmares.  

- **The Dreamcatchers:**  
  - At end of turn, move all Limbo cards to a free Dreamcatcher.  
  - If no free Dreamcatcher, **overload**: remove one Dreamcatcher, return attached cards to Limbo, shuffle into deck.  
  - Lose if all Dreamcatchers are removed.  
  - Freed by reshuffling deck (e.g., after search or Prophecy).  

- **Dark Premonitions:**  
  - Triggered when condition met (e.g., 2 red Doors).  
  - Apply penalty, remove card.  
  - Some reveal new Dark Premonitions.  

- **Denizens:**  
  - When drawn, choose to **rally** by discarding a card from hand.  
  - Once rallied, use ability, then discard.  

- **The Little Incubus:**  
  - **Apprentice/True:** Preemptively reveal cards until a Location is found; place it under Incubus.  
  - Discard stored card to cancel next Nightmare.  

- **Escape (Crossroads & Dead Ends):**  
  - Discard entire hand during Phase 1 to draw a new hand (setup style).

**Q: Can I play a card with the same color but different symbol?**  
A: Yes, as long as **no symbol matches** the previous card.

**Q: What if I can’t play any card due to symbol conflict?**  
A: You must discard. If you discard a Key, you can use Prophecy to manipulate the deck.

**Q: Can I gain a Door that doesn’t match the current Goal?**  
A: Yes, but it goes to Limbo until its turn in the Goal order.

**Q: Can I use a Spell outside my turn?**  
A: No. Spells can be used **at any time during your turn**.

**Q: What happens to Dead End cards during a Prophecy?**  
A: They are revealed but not discarded unless chosen. They remain in hand.

**Q: Can I discard a Tower card that breaks the connection rule?**  
A: Only if the remaining Towers can still connect legally.

**Q: Do Glyph Doors count for Dark Premonition triggers?**  
A: Yes. Any Door on the table counts.

**Q: Can I use a Denizen ability immediately after rallying?**  
A: Yes. Rallying puts it into play; use ability now or later, then discard after use.
