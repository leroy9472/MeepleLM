## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The City Council has approved a zoning map for "The Estates," a new urban development with two rows of four buildings between the river and Main Street. However, investors ignore regulations and begin constructing three rows. The Mayor plans a mansion that will double the value of one row, while sketchy Building Permits allow expansion beyond the river. The Council threatens to demolish buildings in any uncompleted row once two rows are finished. Players act as real estate tycoons competing to maximize their building portfolio value through auctions, strategic construction, and manipulation of row completion.

**Objective**: Be the player with the highest total score by the end of the game. Points come from building values (based on floor and roof numbers), ownership of Company Certificates, and stashed money.

- 36 Floor Cubes (numbered cubes in 6 colors, 6 per color)
- 12 Rooftops (numbered tiles, values hidden until selected)
- 6 Company Certificates (one per color)
- 3 Building Permits (striped barriers labeled I, II, III – affecting row length by ±1, ±2, ±3)
- 1 Mayor Marker

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.
2. Place the 6 Company Certificates near Main Street.
3. Place all 36 Floor Cubes into one bag; randomly draw 24 and arrange them into 3 rows of 8 cubes each (number side up). Return remaining 12 cubes to the box.
4. Shuffle the 12 Rooftops face down and place them near the board (optionally in the second bag).
5. Place the 3 Building Permits, Mayor, and Cancel Cube near the board.
6. Give each player $12 million in checks.
7. Randomly choose the starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in clockwise turns starting with the initial player. On each turn, the active player does two things in order:

#### 1. Stow Away Money (Optional)  
- May place one $1 million check from hand into a personal stash (e.g., tucked under the board).
- This money is removed from play and cannot be used in future auctions.
- Each stashed check is worth 1 point at game end.
- Only one check may be stashed per turn.

#### 2. Start an Auction  
The active player selects one available wooden piece to auction:
- **Floor Cube**: Must be from either end of the 3 rows of 24 exposed cubes.
- **Rooftop**: Only if at least one building lacks a roof and rooftops remain. Reveal number before auction.
- **Building Permit**, **Mayor**, or **Cancel Cube**: Only if not on the board or already discarded.

##### Auction Mechanics:
- Bidding starts with the player to the left of the active player.
- Players bid in clockwise order; each may bid once or pass.
- Bids must be higher than the previous bid and cannot exceed a player’s current cash.
- Illegal Earnings (stashed money) cannot be used for bidding.
- When bidding returns to the active player, they choose:
  - **Option A**: Give the piece to the highest bidder, who pays the bid amount to the active player.
  - **Option B**: Take the piece themselves and pay the highest bid amount to the highest bidder.
- If all other players pass, the active player gets the piece for free.

After winning the auction, the player who acquires the piece **must immediately use it** (place or remove, as applicable).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Placing a Floor Cube (Mandatory)  
- Must be placed immediately.
- Can go in an empty lot or on top of another floor cube (with restrictions).
- **Empty Lot Placement**:
  - Must be the leftmost open space in a row.
  - Cannot skip spaces; no gaps allowed within a row.
  - Cannot build past a Building Permit or river unless extended.
- **Stacking**:
  - Only allowed if the number on the new cube is **lower** than the one directly beneath.
  - Maximum of 6 floors per lot (due to decreasing numbers).
  - Cannot place on top of a rooftop.
- **White Dirt Lots**:
  - 5 designated lots (one per color) allow only **one floor cube total**.
- **Company Certificate**:
  - First player to place a floor cube of a given color takes that color’s Company Certificate.
  - Ownership lasts for the rest of the game.
  - Determines who scores points for that building at the end.

#### Placing a Rooftop (Mandatory)  
- Place on any floor cube without a roof.
- Ends construction of that building (no more additions).
- Reveal rooftop number when placed.

#### Placing a Building Permit (Optional Use)  
- Place on an empty development lot in any row.
- Changes the required length of that row by ±1, ±2, or ±3 (based on permit type).
- **Shortening**: Count from street toward river; place permit in target lot.
- **Lengthening**: Count from river away; extend into meadow.
- Multiple permits can stack in one row (e.g., +3 then –1 = net +2).
- When multiple permits occupy same row, stack them together.
- Cannot shorten a row beyond existing construction.
- Cannot place if it would make a building "float" past the new boundary.
- If not placed, the permit is **removed from the game**.

#### Placing the Mayor (Optional Use)  
- Place on Main Street in front of any one of the 3 rows.
- At game end, all building scores in that row are **doubled** (positive or negative).
- If not placed, the Mayor is **removed from the game**.

#### Using the Cancel Cube (Optional Use)  
- Allows removal of **one** previously placed Building Permit.
- Remove both the selected Building Permit and the Cancel Cube from the game.
- Adjust row length accordingly:
  - If other permits remain, recalculate net change.
  - If no permits remain in the row, revert to original 4-lot length.
- Cannot remove a permit if doing so would result in fewer available lots than currently built.
- If not used, the Cancel Cube is **removed from the game**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Triggers (Game ends immediately when either occurs):  
1. **Two rows are complete**:
   - A row is complete when:
     - All required lots (after permit adjustments) have a building (at least one floor cube).
     - Every building in the row has a rooftop.
   - The third row will score negatively.
2. **No more buildings can be completed**:
   - No more floor cubes or rooftops are available.

#### Scoring Procedure:  
For each building:
- Sum the numbers on all floor cubes + rooftop number.
- Award total points to the player who owns the **Company Certificate** matching the **color of the topmost floor cube**.

Scoring modifiers:
- **Completed Rows**: All buildings score **positive** points.
- **Incomplete Rows**: All buildings score **negative** points.
- **Mayor Row**: All building scores in that row are **doubled** (±).
- **Stashed Money**: Each $1 million check stashed during the game = **1 point**.

Final Score =  
(Sum of all building points) + (Number of stashed checks)

#### Tiebreaker:  
If tied, the player with the most total checks (hand + stashed) wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a row become incomplete after being complete?**  
  Yes. If a Building Permit is placed to lengthen a completed row, it becomes incomplete until the new lots are filled and roofed.

- **Can I bid more than I have?**  
  No. All bids must be within a player’s current cash holdings (excluding stashed money).

- **Can I place a floor cube on any row?**  
  Yes, as long as it follows placement rules (leftmost open space or valid stacking).

- **What happens if all floor cubes are used but rooftops remain?**  
  Game continues until either two rows are complete or no more buildings can be finished.

- **Can I use the Cancel Cube to remove a permit that shortens a row?**  
  Yes, unless removing it would cause the row length to fall below current development.

- **Do I have to place a Building Permit?**  
  No. If you win it, you may choose not to place it — but it is then **removed from the game**.

- **Can multiple players own the same Company Certificate?**  
  No. Only the first player to place a floor cube of a color gets the certificate.

- **Are white dirt lots special beyond single-floor restriction?**  
  No. They follow all other placement rules.
