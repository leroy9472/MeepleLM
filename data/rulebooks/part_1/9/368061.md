## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Zoo Vadis*, animals govern the zoo and campaign for fame, attention, and the prestigious title of Zoo Mascot. Players represent animal species vying to place at least one of their animals in the Star Exhibit while earning the most laurels through strategic advancement, negotiation, and political maneuvering.

**Objective**: Be the player with the most laurels among those who have at least one animal in the Star Exhibit when it becomes fully occupied. If tied, the player whose animal entered the Star Exhibit first wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board with the side matching the number of players (3–5 or 6–7).  
2. Place one peacock figure on each space marked with the current player count. Return unused peacocks to the box.  
3. Place all "I" laurel tokens in a supply pile beside the board. Mix all other laurel tokens (II–V) in the cloth bag. Randomly draw one token from the bag and place it face-up on each laurel path space on the board.  
4. Place the Zoo Keeper token stacked on top of the laurel token directly below the Star Exhibit.  
5. Each player:  
   - Chooses a species  
   - Takes matching player screen, 6 animal figures, and 2 ability tiles  
   - Stands screen in front of them  
   - Places 6 animals in front of screen (visible supply)  
   - Slots ability tiles on top of screen  
6. Each player takes 2 "I" laurel tokens and places them behind their screen.  
7. Determine starting player: whoever most recently visited a zoo; otherwise, choose randomly.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds clockwise. On a turn, a player must take **one** of the following actions:

#### A. Add an Animal to the Zoo  
- Take an animal from your supply.  
- Place it on any empty space in one of the four bottom exhibits.  
- Cannot be taken if all bottom exhibit spaces are full.

#### B. Advance One of Your Animals  
To advance an animal from one exhibit to the next:
- You must have **majority support** in the exhibit being left, **OR**  
- The **Zoo Keeper** must be on the path you are using.

##### Majority Support Rules:
- Majority = more than half the spaces in the exhibit:
  - 1-space exhibit → 1 vote needed (automatic if you're in it)  
  - 3-space exhibit → 2 votes needed  
  - 5-space exhibit → 3 votes needed  
  - 7-space exhibit → 4 votes needed  
- Your own animals count as your votes.  
- Other players may give or withhold support.  
- Peacocks can be bribed for votes (see below).  
- Vote count is based on exhibit size, not number of animals present.

##### Bribing Peacocks:
- Offer a laurel token of **value II or higher** (not two I’s).  
- Discard the bribe to the box.  
- Each bribed peacock grants one vote.  
- Multiple peacocks in the same exhibit may be bribed.

##### Advancement Process:
- Move one of your animals along a path to the next exhibit.  
- Must move forward only; no backward movement.  
- Cannot bypass an exhibit.  
- Must have an empty space in the destination exhibit.  
- When entering the **Star Exhibit**, place the animal in the lowest-numbered empty space (1 to 5).

##### Collecting Laurels:
- If the path has a laurel token **not covered by the Zoo Keeper**, collect it.  
- Replace it with a new token drawn randomly from the bag.  
- If the path has the Zoo Keeper, **do not collect** the token (it remains hidden underneath).  
- Keep collected laurels hidden behind your screen.

##### Special Laurel Tokens:
- If you collect a **"II Zoo Keeper"** or **"II Peacock"** token:  
  → At the **end of your turn**, you may take a **bonus action**: Move the Zoo Keeper **or** Advance a Peacock.  
- If you collect a **"II Ability"** token:  
  → **Immediately**, recover one of your used ability tiles (return it to your screen).  
- These special effects are **personal and non-transferable**, even if the token is later traded.

#### C. Advance a Peacock  
- Choose any peacock on the board.  
- Move it one exhibit forward along a path to an empty space.  
- Peacocks **do not require majority support** to move.  
- Peacocks **do not collect laurels** when moving.  
- After moving, take **one "I" laurel token** from the supply.  
- Peacocks **can enter the Star Exhibit** and may trigger the endgame.

*Bonus Action*: If you collected a "II Peacock" token during an animal advance, you may take this action at the end of your turn.

#### D. Move the Zoo Keeper  
- Move the Zoo Keeper token to any other **laurel token** on the board.  
- Stack it face-up on top of that token.  
- The Zoo Keeper **unlocks advancement without majority support** for any animal using that path.  
- It **hides the laurel token beneath it**, preventing collection during movement.

*Bonus Action*: If you collected a "II Zoo Keeper" token during an animal advance, you may take this action at the end of your turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Animal Abilities  
- Each player has two identical ability tiles representing their species’ unique power.  
- Abilities can be used **on other players’ turns**, affecting their actions.  
- You **cannot use your ability on yourself**.  
- The active player may **accept or reject** the use of an ability.  
- After use, remove the tile from your screen and place it behind it.  
- When your ability is used, you gain **0, 1, or 2 "I" laurels** from the supply (as shown on the tile).  
- You may negotiate compensation (laurels, votes, etc.) in addition to the base reward.  
- Abilities can affect peacocks **if another player is moving them**.  
- You may use **both** of your ability tiles over the course of the game.  
- **Recovery**: Collecting a "II Ability" token allows you to **immediately recover one used ability tile**.

##### Animal Ability Summary:
- **Hyena**: Allow active player to move Zoo Keeper before or after their action. (Reward: 2 I's)  
- **Tiger**: Allow moving animal to collect the laurel even if Zoo Keeper is on the path. (Reward: 1 I)  
- **Marmoset**: Allow moving animal to collect a **different** laurel token from the board. (Reward: 1 I)  
- **Crocodile**: Allow animal to **advance again** after entering a 1-space exhibit (even after "Add Animal" action). (Reward: 1 I)  
- **Ibis**: Allow animal to enter a **full exhibit** (max one extra animal per exhibit). (Reward: 2 I's)  
- **Armadillo**: Allow animal to advance **through a tunnel** without majority support. (Reward: 0 I's)  
- **Rhino**: Allow moving animal to **move a second animal** with it (any owner, including peacock). Second animal does not collect laurels. Requires two empty destination spaces. (Reward: 1 I)

##### Ability Combinations (Officially Recognized):
- Ibis + Crocodile: Enter full 1-space exhibit, then move again.  
- Ibis + Armadillo: Use tunnel to enter full exhibit.  
- Crocodile + Armadillo: Use tunnel to enter 1-space exhibit and move again, or move out via tunnel.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends **immediately** when the **Star Exhibit is completely filled** (all 5 spaces occupied).  
- All players with **at least one animal in the Star Exhibit** reveal their laurel tokens and total them.  
- The player with the **most laurels wins** and becomes the Zoo Mascot.  
- **Tiebreaker**: The tied player whose animal entered the Star Exhibit **first** wins.  
  - Entry order is determined by the **numerical order** of placement (space 1 filled first, then 2, etc.).

**Note**: Players with **no animals in the Star Exhibit** are **disqualified**, even if they have the most laurels.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I change my action if I can’t get votes?**  
  Yes. If you attempt to advance an animal but fail to secure votes, you may instead choose a different action.

- **Can I make change with laurels?**  
  No. You cannot exchange higher-value laurels for lower ones using the supply. Negotiate with other players if needed.

- **Can I use multiple animal abilities in one turn?**  
  Yes. Multiple players may offer their abilities during a single turn. The active player decides which (if any) to accept.

- **Can I use my ability on a peacock?**  
  Yes, but only if another player is advancing the peacock during their turn.

- **Do I get a laurel when someone uses my ability?**  
  Yes. You always receive the base reward (0, 1, or 2 "I" tokens) from the supply, **in addition** to any negotiated compensation.

- **What happens when a special token is drawn to replace a collected one?**  
  It is placed face-up and functions normally if collected later.

- **Can peacocks block the Star Exhibit?**  
  Yes. Peacocks can occupy spaces in the Star Exhibit and may trigger the endgame.

- **Can I move the Zoo Keeper onto a path with no token?**  
  No. The Zoo Keeper must be placed **on top of a laurel token**.

- **Can I use a bonus action if I traded the special token?**  
  No. The bonus action (Move Zoo Keeper / Advance Peacock / Recover Ability) is **only available to the player who collected** the token during an animal advance.
