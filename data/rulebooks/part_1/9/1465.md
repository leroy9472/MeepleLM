## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the ancient Magician Academy of Stonehenge, apprentices trained their predictive magic using the game of Wizard. The objective is to correctly predict the exact number of tricks you will win in each round. Players earn points for accurate predictions and lose points for over- or underestimating. The player with the highest score at the end of the final hand wins and ascends to the rank of wise Wizard.

2. Components  
- 60-card deck:  
  - 4 suits (e.g., Humans/blue, Elves/green, Dwarves/red, Giants/yellow), each with cards ranked 1 (lowest) through 13 (highest)  
  - 4 Wizard cards (Z): unsuited, highest rank, always trump  
  - 4 Jester (or Fool) cards (N): unsuited, lowest rank, never trump  
- Score sheet ("Tablet of Truth")  
- Optional: coins or chips to track bids and tricks

3. Setup  
- Determine first dealer: Deal one card to each player; highest card deals.  
- Number of players: 3–6  
- Number of rounds:  
  - 3 players: 20 rounds  
  - 4 players: 15 rounds  
  - 5 players: 12 rounds  
  - 6 players: 10 rounds  
- Each round:  
  - Dealer shuffles the full 60-card deck  
  - Deal n cards per player in round n (1 card in round 1, 2 in round 2, etc.)  
  - Remaining undealt cards form a face-down deck; turn the top card face-up to determine trump  
- After each round, deal passes to the left

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Deal cards for the current round  
2. Reveal top card of remaining deck to set trump  
3. Players bid in clockwise order, starting left of dealer  
4. Play tricks:  
   - First trick led by player to dealer’s left  
   - Winner of each trick leads the next  
5. Score the hand  
6. Proceed to next round until all cards are dealt

5. Core Mechanics  
- Trump Determination:  
  - Face-up top card sets trump suit  
  - If Jester/Fool: no trump  
  - If Wizard: dealer chooses trump suit (after viewing hand)  
  - Final round: no trump (no card to reveal)  

- Bidding:  
  - Each player states number of tricks they will win  
  - Bids may range from 0 to number of cards in hand  
  - Bidding starts left of dealer, proceeds clockwise  
  - Total bids may equal or differ from number of tricks available  
  - Bids are recorded on score sheet  

- Trick Play:  
  - Lead: Any card may be led  
  - Following: Must follow suit if possible  
  - If unable to follow suit, may play any card  
  - Wizards and Jesters may be played at any time, even when able to follow suit  

- Leading with Special Cards:  
  - Wizard led:  
    - Wins trick immediately (as first Wizard played)  
    - Other players may play any card  
  - Jester led:  
    - Suit is determined by the next card played  
    - Jester has no suit; does not set lead suit  

- Winning the Trick:  
  - Trick is won by:  
    1. The first Wizard played, OR  
    2. If no Wizard: highest trump played, OR  
    3. If no trump: highest card of the lead suit  
  - Jesters always lose, unless all cards in the trick are Jesters — then the first Jester played wins  

- Leading Next Trick:  
  - Winner of current trick leads the next

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Scoring:  
  - If bid is correct: 20 points + 10 points per trick won  
  - If bid is incorrect: lose 10 points per trick over or under the bid  
    (e.g., bid 2, took 1 → lose 10; bid 0, took 1 → lose 10)  

- End of Hand:  
  - Score immediately after each hand  
  - Dealer rotates left  

- Game End:  
  - Final hand is when all 60 cards are dealt out  
  - Game length depends on player count (see Setup)  
  - Final hand is scored normally  
  - Player with highest total score wins
