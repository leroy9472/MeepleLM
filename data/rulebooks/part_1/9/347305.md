### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Turn Structure (4 Steps):  
1. **Activate Chain Actions**:  
   - Move Chain Action Tokens from "unavailable" to "available" side based on Influence Track position (0–3).  

2. **Perform Main Action**:  
   - **Eras 1–2, 1st/2nd Rounds**: Move 1 Season Pillar to an accessible Forum row (no prior pillar).  
   - **Era 3, 3rd Round**: Move Epoch Pillar to an accessible Forum row.  
   - Each opponent with a pillar on the space gains 1 Influence (max 10).  

   **Available Actions**:  
   - **Present an Idea**: Move an Idea from right of Society Board to empty Region Display; place matching Specialists on Specialist Tile; gain benefit.  
   - **Invent**: Invent an Idea in a region if you have access to its Milestone (Common Knowledge, your Private, opponent’s with Diplomat, or earlier Era). Place Aspiration Tile (Technology), exhaust matching Specialist (and Scholars if needed), flip Idea to Invention.  
   - **Call Specialists**: Place Aspiration Tile (Economy); return Citizens from 1 region to matching Specialist spaces; may perform 1 Chain Action per Invention (once per turn).  
   - **Travel**: Place Aspiration Tile (Culture); move 1 Citizen to adjacent region via blue rope; may take Sage and perform Chain Action.  
   - **Send Diplomat**: Move Specialist or Scholar to any Milestone Tile with space; gain benefit. If opponent’s and from later Era, opponent gains 1 Influence.  
   - **Share Invention**: Choose Invention with adjacent Citizen.  
     - Presenter scores IP = Era × their Citizens.  
     - Inventor moves Invention left.  
     - Innovator places 1 Citizen in region.  
     - You gain 1 Wealth Tile (new letter) or wild Aspiration Tile.  
   - **Innovate**: On another player’s Invention, exhaust matching Specialist; gain 1 new matching Specialist; may perform Chain Action.  
   - **Gain Influence**: In region with majority and no Influence Token, return Citizens (number = token cost) to Specialists; place Influence Token; gain IP beneath it; gain Influence = number of faceup Influence Tokens. May perform 1 Chain Action on any faceup Influence Token.  
   - **Eureka**: If Eureka Display Era > your Milestone Era:  
     - Move your Private Milestone to Common Knowledge; splay oldest Common Knowledge Milestone if needed.  
     - Take a Milestone from Eureka Display; place Citizen on it.  
     - Advance Era Marker to new Milestone’s Era; gain benefit.  
   - **Call Diplomat**: Return Diplomat from Milestone to Society Board as Scholar; gain benefit.  

3. **Replace Aspiration Tiles**:  
   - Replace each Aspiration Tile in your Tiles Display with matching Progress Tile (any number/type, but only 1 per number/type). Wild Aspiration Tiles can become any type. Return replaced Aspiration Tiles to supply.  

4. **Build Progress/Wealth Tiles (Optional)**:  
   - Pay Influence:  
     - 1 Tile = 3 Influence  
     - 2 Tiles = 2 Influence  
     - 3 Tiles = 1 Influence  
     - 4 Tiles = 0 Influence  
   - May build up to (Private Milestone Era – 1) Tiles.  
   - For each Tile:  
     - Place on empty space of Progress Map; gain space benefit.  
     - Exhaust matching Specialists (or Scholars):  
       - Base: 1 Specialist  
       - Wealth Tile: +1  
       - Each adjacent built Tile: +1  
       - Each matching Invention: –1 (not for Wealth)  

#### Chain Actions:  
- Available when Chain Action Tokens are activated.  
- Can be used on Inventions, Influence Tokens, or Knowledge Tiles.  
- Each Chain Action can be used only once per turn, even if multiple are available.  

#### Citizens & Specialists:  
- **Available**: In upper space of Specialty area (upright).  
- **Exhausted**: Moved to lower space (lying down).  
- **Refreshing**: Move from lower to upper space and stand up.  
- **Scholars**: Wild; max = Private Milestone Era. When exhausted, must commit to a Specialty.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Era 6 – Final Scoring**:  
- **Influence Track**: Score 1, 5, or 10 IP based on level.  
- **Wealth Tiles**: Score each on Progress Map (value per tile).  
- **Private Goals**: Score any 2 of your 3–4 Private Goal Cards.  
- **Public Goals (if used)**: Score at end of Eras 2, 3, 4.  

**Tiebreakers (in order)**:  
1. Most Tiles on Progress Map  
2. Most Inventions to the left of Society Board  
3. Fewest Citizens remaining in supply (highest population)  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Chronos AI Behavior**:  
  - Moves Season Pillar to next region in numerical order.  
  - Prefers: Present → Invent → Share → Innovate.  
  - Does not take Chain Actions.  
  - Citizens are all Scholars (no Academy limit).  
  - Accesses all Milestones (Common, Private, discarded).  
  - Gains Progress Tiles matching region type/number; if unavailable, next region.

    - If IP side: gain IP from all faceup Knowledge Tiles, flip all to Chain Action side.  
  - Return Sage to empty board space after use.  

- **Eureka Display Refresh**:  
  - After Eras 2–4: Non-player’s Private Milestone → Common Knowledge; replaced by rightmost Eureka Tile.  
  - Remaining Eureka Tiles → Common Knowledge; push out older ones (splay discard).

  - If more Aspiration Tiles than spaces, choose which to keep at end of turn; discard rest.  

- **Progress Tile Limits**:  
  - Only 1 Progress Tile per number per type.  
  - Only 1 Wealth Tile per letter.
