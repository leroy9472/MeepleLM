## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Stationfall is a hidden identity, social deduction game set aboard a failing space station. Players assume secret roles with individual agendas, manipulating characters and systems to achieve personal goals before the station is destroyed. The game ends at Stationfall—either through reentry, antimatter detonation, or other catastrophic triggers. The winner is the player with the most victory points who is not Guilty.

**Primary Objective:** Score the most points by fulfilling your Player Character’s (PC) Agenda, leveraging Bonus Characters, managing influence, and escaping safely.

**Key Conditions to Win:**
- Must not be Guilty at the end of the game.
- If Guilty, can only win by delivering Evidence to Authorities during Stationfall.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round is a "Minute." Players take turns in clockwise order. After all players complete a turn, the Minute Marker advances.

**Turn Order:**
1. **Reveal (Optional)**
2. **Influence (Optional)**
3. **Activate or Renegotiate**
4. **Resolve Time Markers and Events**

#### 1. Reveal (Optional)
- Reveal your Secret Identity as your PC, or perform a **Schrödinger Reveal**: discard your Secret Identity and reveal your Bonus Character as your PC.
- Place your Reveal Marker on the PC’s card.
- Retrieve all your Influence Cubes from the PC; move others’ cubes to the Betrayal Box.
- Activate Reveal Powers (one-time or persistent effects).

#### 2. Influence (Optional)
- Place any number of your Influence Cubes on **one** live, non-PC, non-Escaped, non-Annihilated Character.
- A Character is your **Conspirator** if:
  - You have at least one Influence Cube on it, and
  - No other player has more cubes on it.
- Your own PC is always your Conspirator.

#### 3. Activate or Renegotiate
You must choose one:

**Activate:**
- Choose one of your Conspirators.
- If the Character has no Activation Disc (not Exhausted): perform **2 Actions**.
- If it has any Activation Disc (Exhausted): perform **1 Action**.
- Always get **1 Free Pick Up or Drop** with the activated Character.
- You may also:
  - **Use Bribe (once/turn)**: Spend Bribe Token to perform 1 Action with any live, non-escaped Character (not your PC). Owner of a PC may refuse.
  - **Use Kompromat (once/turn)**: Spend Kompromat to perform 1 Action with any live, non-escaped Character. Owner of a PC may refuse; if so, they become Suspect.

After Activation, place your Activation Disc on the Character.

**Renegotiate (instead of Activate):**
- Retrieve your Activation Disc.
- Optionally, retrieve one of your Influence Cubes from any non-Escaped, non-Annihilated Character.

#### 4. Resolve
- Resolve any Time Markers you placed:
  - On Sections: resolve at end of your next turn.
  - On Minute Track: resolve at end of that minute.
- Resolve Monster actions if in play.

- **Drop**: Leave an Item in current Section.
- **Give**: Transfer Item to colocated Character (cannot exceed recipient’s item limit).

  - Minute 1 reached.
  - Antimatter Armed.
  - Self-Destruct or Release Project X.
  - Blackout.
- **Escape**: Via Pod launch. Pod must be Occupied and meet launch requirements.

#### Suspicion & Guilt
