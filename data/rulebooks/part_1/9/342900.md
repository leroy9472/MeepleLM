## Earthborne Rangers — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
As Earthborne Rangers, you explore a recovering Earth, navigating dynamic environments shaped by weather, terrain, and ecological challenges. Your goal is to investigate locations, complete Missions, assist allies, and travel to new regions. There is no fixed win condition—progress is measured through exploration, story advancement, and mission completion across a campaign. The day ends when your stamina (deck) is depleted, you suffer a third injury, or you choose to camp after arriving at a new location. Camping preserves progress; otherwise, all progress is lost.

2. Components  
- Ranger Decks (30 cards each): Composed of Personality (8), Background (10), Specialty (10), and Outside Interest (2) cards.  
- Role Cards: Define unique abilities and starting energy.  
- Aspect Cards: Track energy tokens.  
- Challenge Deck: Contains Challenge cards with icons and effects that trigger during tests.  
- Path Deck: Drawn from Terrain-specific cards (12), Pivotal Location cards (if applicable), or generic Valley cards (3) + Mission-added cards.  
- Location Cards: Represent current area; include arrival instructions and terrain type.  
- Weather Cards: Affect gameplay based on daily conditions.  
- Mission Cards: Provide objectives and narrative goals.  
- Gear Cards: Played and equipped for ongoing effects.  
- Tokens: Energy, harm (injury), and Ranger tokens.  
- Fatigue Deck: Side deck formed by burning cards from your deck.  
- Playmat Zones: Player Area, Within Reach (WR), Along the Way (ATW), Surroundings (shared areas).

3. Setup  
1. Each player prepares a 30-card Ranger deck and shuffles it.  
2. Place Role and Aspect cards in your player area. Load energy tokens onto the Aspect card per role.  
3. Draw 6 cards; may mulligan any number, then draw back to 6.  
4. Elect a Lead Ranger.  
5. Shuffle the Challenge deck.  
6. Place the current Location card in the Surroundings (per Campaign tracker).  
7. Place the Weather card (leftmost unchecked day) to the left of the Location.  
8. Place uncompleted Mission cards to the right of the Location.  
9. Build the Path deck:  
   - If at a Pivotal Location: 12 cards from current Terrain set + all Pivotal Location cards.  
   - Otherwise: 3 cards from generic Valley deck + any Mission-added cards.  
   Shuffle thoroughly.  
10. Resolve Arrival Setup: Follow instructions on the back of the Location card (each Ranger resolves one effect).  
11. Resolve any “Start of the Day” effects.

4. Gameplay Flow  
A Day consists of multiple Rounds. Each Round follows this order:

**Phase 1: Draw Path Card**  
- Draw the top card of the Path deck and place it faceup in the Surroundings.  
- This introduces a new being, plant, or feature to the location.

**Phase 2: Ranger Turns (in clockwise order)**  
On your turn, take **one action**:  
- **Play a card** from hand to your player area, WR, or ATW (costs energy tokens).  
- **Test a card** (interact via Challenge card) — costs energy and may cause Fatigue.

**Testing a Card:**  
- Choose a card in play (except in another Ranger’s equipped gear).  
- Spend 1 energy token.  
- Determine Fatigue:  
  - Ignore your player area and the target card’s zone.  
  - All active, non-Friendly cards in zones between you and the target cause Fatigue equal to their Presence (top-right number).  
  - Burn that many cards from the top of your deck to the Fatigue deck.  
- Draw a Challenge card:  
  - Reveal it and resolve its test icon (e.g., Leaf, Crest).  
  - Trigger **Challenge effects** on all active, ready cards matching that icon.  
    - Active cards: ready cards in Surroundings, ATW, WR (yours or others’ **only if** you’re testing in another’s WR), or your player area.  
    - Exhausted or inactive cards do not trigger.  
- After test, exhaust the target card (unless specified otherwise).

**Dodge Mechanic (Optional):**  
- Before testing, you may Dodge specific cards.  
- Dodged cards do **not** contribute to Fatigue and do **not** block interaction (ignore Obstacle keyword).  
- They remain active, so their Challenge effects **still trigger**.

**End of Turn:**  
- Pass when you cannot or choose not to act.  
- When all Rangers pass, proceed to Travel Phase.

**Phase 3: Travel (Optional)**  
- If the group chooses, attempt to travel to a new location:  
  - Reveal a new Location card.  
  - Resolve its arrival instructions.  
  - **Camping is now possible** — saves all progress.  
- If not traveling, continue to next Round.

**Phase 4: New Round**  
- Return all exhausted cards to ready.  
- Refresh energy: refill Aspect card with energy tokens.  
- Draw 1 card (if able).  
- Repeat Phase 1.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Energy**: Spent to play cards or test cards. Replenished at the start of each new Round.  
- **Fatigue**: Caused by non-Friendly, ready cards in zones between you and your test target. Burn cards from your deck to the Fatigue deck.  
- **Soothe**: Some card abilities let you move cards from Fatigue deck back to hand.  
- **Injury**:  
  - Suffer 1 injury → place harm token on Role card, discard Fatigue deck.  
  - Each injury causes 1 Fatigue when refreshing energy each Round.  
  - 3rd injury → end the day at the end of your turn; add 1 Lingering Injury card to your deck.  
- **Active Cards**:  
  - Ready cards in Surroundings, ATW, WR (yours), or your player area.  
  - When testing in another Ranger’s WR, their WR cards become active for that turn.  
- **Challenge Effects**:  
  - Trigger after a test if the Challenge card’s icon matches any active, ready card.  
  - Resolved in any order (group decides).  
- **Attach**:  
  - Place card under another. Faceup = in play; facedown = out of play.  
  - If parent card leaves play, attached cards are discarded.  
- **Move**: Relocate a card to another valid zone (unless specified).  
- **Scout**: Look at top X cards of a deck; place any number on top/bottom in any order.  
- **Ranger Tokens**:  
  - Placed on cards by certain effects.  
  - Each Ranger token on a card causes other Rangers to commit 1 additional effort when testing that card.  
  - Some progress thresholds require one Ranger token per Ranger to clear.  
  - Return Ranger token to Role card if discarded or not on a card.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is **no traditional scoring**. Progress is narrative and campaign-based.  
- **Day ends** if:  
  - You need to draw or fatigue a card but your deck is empty.  
  - You suffer your 3rd injury (end of turn).  
  - The group camps after arriving at a new location.  
- When the day ends:  
  1. Check off the day on the Campaign tracker.  
  2. Record current location and terrain type.  
  3. Reset all cards: return to respective decks.  
  4. Lose all progress (tokens, gear, rewards).  
- **Camping**:  
  - Only allowed after arriving at a new location.  
  - Saves progress; end the session or start a new day from this point.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I test a card in another Ranger’s WR?**  
  Yes. Their WR cards become active for your turn; they may cause Fatigue and trigger Challenge effects.  
- **Does Friendly prevent Challenge effects?**  
  No. Friendly only prevents Fatigue. Challenge effects still trigger if active and ready.  
- **What happens to attached cards when a card is exhausted?**  
  They remain attached. Only leaving play (e.g., discard, return to deck) removes them.  
- **Can I Dodge an Obstacle to interact behind it?**  
  Yes. Dodging negates both Fatigue and Obstacle blocking.  
- **Is the target card’s zone included in Fatigue calculation?**  
  No. Only zones **between** you and the target (excluding both your player area and the target’s zone).  
- **Do Challenge effects stack?**  
  Yes. Every active, ready card with a matching icon triggers its effect.  
- **Can I play a card without energy?**  
  No. All card plays cost energy tokens. If you lack energy, you cannot play cards.
