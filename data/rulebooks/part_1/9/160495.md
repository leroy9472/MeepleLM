4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of 3 phases:  
1. **Phase I: Draw Cards**  
   - Each player draws 2 cards from each deck (6 total).  
   - (Variant: Rounds 1–4: draw 3 per deck, keep 2, discard 1.)  

2. **Phase II: Play Cards**  
   - Starting with first player, then clockwise, each player plays 1 card per turn until all 6 cards are played.  
   - On your turn, play 1 card and choose one action:  
     - **Unification Action**: Tuck card under a Region on your player board (max 3 per Region).  
       - Gain Unification Markers:  
         - 1st card in Region: 1 value-1 marker of card’s color  
         - 2nd: 2 markers  
         - 3rd: 3 markers  
         - If supply exhausted, gain 1 VP per missing marker.  
       - Increase Unrest:  
         - 2nd card: +1 Unrest in that Region  
         - 3rd card: +2 Unrest in that Region  
       - Card remains and provides ability when triggered.  
     - **Court Action**: Play card to Court pile. Perform one of six actions:  
       1. **Recruit an Official**: Take 1 red, grey, or white Official from supply, place in Governor area of any Region.  
       2. **Re-assign Officials**: Spend 1–3 movement points to move Officials:  
          - Between adjacent Regions (not diagonal; walls block adjacency).  
          - Between Worker and Governor areas of same Region (free, can be done anytime).  
          - Worker areas hold max 2 Officials.  
       3. **Install a Governor**:  
          - Remove 1 red, 1 white, 1 grey Official from Governor area of same Region.  
          - Place 1 Governor on gameboard in matching Region (empty bonus space).  
          - Choose bonus: +4 VP, +1 Official, or +4 re-assignment points.  
          - Reset Unrest in that Region to 0.  
          - Check Tasks.  
       4. **Hire Workers**:  
          - Select Region with ≥1 Official in Worker area.  
          - Take 1 Worker per Official (max 2).

       5. **Build a Palace**:  
          - Remove 2 Workers from target Region + 1 Worker from a different Region.  
          - Place Palace on empty slot in target Region.  
          - Gain 1 value-3 Unification Marker (if available).  
          - Score VP = total cards on your player board.  
          - Check Tasks.  
       6. **Build a Wall**:  
          - Choose empty Wall slot (1 per player per section).  
          - Remove 1–3 Workers from different Regions (based on slot’s rod count).  
          - Place Wall on slot.  
          - Check Tasks.  
   - After Court Action:  
     - If card’s activation number is **higher** than previous Court card → activate abilities triggered by "Build Wall", "Build Palace", "Hire Workers".  
     - If card’s number is **lower** → activate abilities triggered by "Recruit Official", "Install Governor".  
     - "Re-assign Officials" triggers no abilities.  
     - Player chooses order of ability activation.  
     - Cannot activate cards in Regions with max Unrest.  
     - On first Court card, player chooses "X" value to compare.  

3. **Phase III: Unification Rewards**  
   - For each aspect (Ivory/Writing → Orange/Currency → Brown/Law):  
     - Players sum values of their Unification Markers (value-1 = 1, value-3 = 3).  
     - Player with highest total (must have ≥1 marker) may accept or pass.  
     - Tiebreaker: disc position on Rewards Track (top to bottom), then disc in current round column.  
     - To accept:  
       - Return all markers of that color.  
       - Take reward shown in current round column for that aspect.  
       - Move your disc to that reward space.  
     - If pass: keep markers, reward passes to next highest.  
   - After all 3 rewards:  
     - Return all discs to Rewards Track in current tiebreaker order.  
     - Player with top disc becomes first player for next round.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Unification Markers**: Track influence in Writing, Currency, Law. Used for rewards and final scoring.  
- **Unrest**: Tracked per Region on player board. Limits actions (e.g., cannot place 3rd card if Unrest would exceed max). Max Unrest: 2, 3, or 4 depending on Region and board side.  
- **Card Abilities**: Activated after Court Actions if number condition is met. Examples:  
  - Gain 1 marker of choice  
  - Spend 2 re-assignment points  
  - Score VP (2 or 3)  
  - Place 1 Worker (no Unrest)  
  - Score VP = number of cards of specific color  
  - Decrease Unrest by 1 (any Region or same Region)  
  - Move 1 Worker to adjacent Region  
  - Place 1 Official of indicated color  
- **B-Side Player Boards**: Provide persistent abilities after specific Court Actions (e.g., extra Worker when hiring, free marker when building Wall).  
- **Tasks**: 6 total (2 per type). Accomplished by having required Governors, Palaces, or Walls in depicted Regions/Wall Sites. Claim by placing disc on Task slot.  
- **Movement Rules**: Adjacent Regions connected by solid lines; walls block adjacency. Free move from Governor to Worker area.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after Round 5. Final scoring:  
I. **Majority of Governors per Region**:  
   - Most Governors in a Region: 9 VP + 3 VP per Governor.  
   - Tie: points split, rounded down.  
II. **Majority of Unification Markers**:  
   - Most Writing (Ivory): 5 VP  
   - Most Currency (Orange): 6 VP  
   - Most Law (Brown): 7 VP  
   - Tie: player with topmost disc on Rewards Track wins.  
III. **Task Discs**:  
   - For each Task section (upper/lower):  
     - 1 disc: 1× VP shown  
     - 2 discs: 2× VP shown  
     - 3 discs: 3× VP shown  
IV. **Walls**:  
   - For each Wall, score VP based on slot (1/2/3 rods) and condition on Wall tile. Conditions include:  
     - Empty Unrest Track (1–3 VP)  
     - 3 cards of different colors (2–4 VP)  
     - Officials ≥ Unrest (1–3 VP)  
     - 3 cards in Region (2–4 VP)  
     - At least 1 grey/red/white Official (2–4 VP each)  
     - At least 2 same-color cards (1–3 VP)  
     - At least 1 Ivory/Orange/Brown card (1–3 VP each)
