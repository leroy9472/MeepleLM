## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 1889, Paris dazzles the world during the Exposition Universelle, showcasing the marvel of electric lighting. Players assume the roles of influential Parisian figures competing to develop the most illuminated and artistically inspired cityscape. The objective is to maximize victory points by constructing buildings that are well-lit by streetlights, forming large connected building groups, and strategically using action postcards.

The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most visible free cobblestone spaces of their color wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Choose Action Postcards**: Select 8 postcards to use for the game. For first games, use those marked with a 品 symbol. Place them face up around the board.  
2. **Place Special Pieces**: Set aside special pieces with their corresponding postcards.  
3. **Assign Player Materials**: Each player chooses a color (orange or blue) and takes:  
   - 8 cobblestone tiles  
   - 7 chimneys  
   - 4 action tokens  
4. **Shuffle and Draw**: Each player shuffles their cobblestone tiles and places them face down in a pile. Draw the top tile and hold it secretly.  
5. **First Player**: The player who lost the previous game starts. If it’s the first game, the last person to turn on a light in any room goes first.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game is played in two phases:

#### Phase 1: Placing Cobblestone Tiles and Gathering Buildings  
Players alternate turns. On your turn, choose one of the following:

- **Place a Cobblestone Tile**:  
  - Place your tile face up on any empty square of the 16-square board.  
  - You may rotate it to any orientation.  
  - After placing, draw the next tile from your pile and keep it hidden.

- **Take a Building**:  
  - Add one building from the common pool to your reserve.  
  - It’s wise to collect 3–4 buildings before Phase 2.

This phase ends when all 16 cobblestone tiles are placed.  
A player who places all 8 of their tiles may pass or continue taking buildings until the opponent finishes.

#### Phase 2: Placing Buildings and Activating Actions  
The player who placed all 8 of their cobblestone tiles first takes the first turn in this phase. Players alternate.

On your turn, choose one of the following:

- **Place a Building**:  
  - Place one building from your reserve on the board.  
  - It must occupy only **free spaces** of your color or **mixed-color** spaces.  
  - Buildings **cannot** be placed on Streetlight spaces.  
  - After placing, put one of your chimneys on top to claim ownership.

- **Activate an Action Postcard**:  
  - Choose a face-up postcard.  
  - Perform its action (or not, for blocking).  
  - Flip the card face down and place your action token on it.  
  - Once used, it cannot be used again.

**Exception**: *Metropolitain* allows deferral—place token now, use action later.

This phase ends when:
- Neither player can place more buildings, **and**  
- All 8 action tokens (4 per player) have been used.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Cobblestone Tiles  
- Each tile occupies one board square.  
- Spaces can be:  
  - Orange, blue, mixed, or Streetlight.  
- A space is **free** if unoccupied (even Streetlight spaces).  
- Mixed spaces can be used by either player.

#### Building Placement  
- Buildings must be placed entirely on free spaces of your color or mixed spaces.  
- Cannot cover Streetlight spaces unless using *Metropolitain*.  
- Chimneys mark ownership.

#### Streetlight Illumination  
- Each **Streetlight** (including *Lampadaire*, *La Grande Lumière*, and base Streetlight spaces) illuminates the **four orthogonally adjacent** spaces (not diagonal).  
- A building gains points for each **Streetlight** adjacent to **any** of its spaces.  
- A single Streetlight can illuminate multiple buildings.  
- **Buildings block light**—no illumination passes behind them.  
- Other pieces (e.g., Fountain, Dancer) do **not** block light.

#### Action Postcards  
- Players claim postcards in Phase 2 by placing their action token.  
- Most must be used immediately; only *Metropolitain* and *Chartier* allow delayed use.  
- Blocking an opponent’s access is a valid strategy.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After Phase 2, score as follows:

#### + Illuminated Buildings  
For each building:  
- Multiply its **size** (number of spaces) by the number of **Streetlights** illuminating it (orthogonally adjacent).  
- A building with **0** adjacent Streetlights scores **0** points.  
- *La Grande Lumière* counts as a Streetlight and lights up spaces shown on its card (blocked by buildings).

#### + Largest Building Group  
- A group is formed when buildings of the same player **share edges** (orthogonal only; diagonals don’t count).  
- Score **1 point per space** in your **largest** connected group.  
- Illumination does not affect this score.

#### – Unbuilt Buildings  
- **–3 points** for each building in your reserve that was not placed.  
- *Sacré-Cœur* negates this penalty.

#### + Action Postcards  
- Some postcards have a stamp (●) and grant **+1 VP each** if used.  
- Others grant specific endgame points (see individual card rules).

A: The statue scores **0 points**.

**Q: Does *Notre-Dame de Paris* double the points for a building?**  
A: No. It only allows **both players** to count the building toward their **largest group** size.

**Q: Can *La Seine* be placed on any side?**  
A: Yes. The player who plays it chooses which side becomes the riverbank.

**Q: Does *Hôtel des Invalides* count as a building?**  
A: Yes. It is a size-1 building and scores normally.

**Q: Can *Tour Eiffel* be placed on mixed or opponent’s tiles?**  
A: The four spaces must include **at least one Streetlight** and must be **unoccupied**. The tile colors don’t matter as long as no buildings or pieces are present.
