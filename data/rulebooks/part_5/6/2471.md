# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The goal of Zombies!!! is to be the first player to reach the center square of the Helipad tile and escape the advancing zombie horde. Alternatively, a player wins by being the first to collect 25 zombies. In solo and cooperative modes, all players must reach the helipad under specific conditions to win. Competitive variants introduce alternate victory paths such as last-man-standing or key retrieval.

## 2. Components
- 50 Map Tiles:
  - 1 Town Square
  - 1 Helipad
  - 12 Named Buildings: Police Station, Fire Station, Hospital, Sporting Goods Store, Lawn & Garden Store, Hardware Store, Toy Store, Gas Station, Skate Shop, Florist Shop, Drug Store, Army Surplus
  - 4 Corners (6 including Hardware Store and Toy Store)
  - 4 4-way Intersections (5 including Town Square)
  - 4 T-shaped Intersections (7 including Gas Station, Florist Shop, Skate Shop)
  - 4 Straights (6 including Drug Store and Army Surplus)
- 100 Plastic Zombies
- 6 Plastic Shotgun Guys (player pawns)
- 30 Life Tokens
- 60 Bullet Tokens
- 50-Card Event Deck (includes weapon/item cards)
- 2 Six-Sided Dice

## 3. Setup
- Place the Town Square tile in the center of the play area.
- Each player places their Shotgun Guy on the center space of the Town Square.
- Shuffle the remaining map tiles and place the Helipad tile within the bottom half of the deck (position may vary for shorter games).
- Shuffle the event deck and deal 3 cards to each player.
- Each player receives 3 life tokens and 3 bullet tokens.
- The weapon deck is separated from the event deck and placed face-down; optionally, the top card may be revealed.
- In cooperative scenarios, special starting conditions apply (e.g., Cop Chase starts in the Police Station).

## 4. Gameplay Flow
### Standard Turn Sequence:
1. **Draw Event Cards**: If holding fewer than 3 event cards, draw until you have 3.
2. **Place Map Tile**: Draw and place a new tile adjacent to your current tile, connecting roads legally. Exploration Mode (see below) may modify this.
3. **Combat Zombies**: Fight any zombie on your current space. Roll a die: 4+ to kill it and collect; 1–3 means lose 1 life and reroll until resolved.
4. **Roll for Movement**: Roll 1d6 to determine movement allowance.
5. **Move**: Move up to the rolled number of spaces orthogonally. Must stop and fight zombies encountered during movement.
6. **Optional Weapon Search**: If ending movement in a cleared named building, roll 5+ on 1d6 to draw a weapon from the top of the weapon deck. Mark building as searched with a token.
7. **Zombie Movement**: Roll 1d6 and move that many zombies one space each toward the nearest player (or pilot, in Flight Delay), prioritizing closest zombies.

### Exploration Mode:
When landing on a tile with unconnected road edges, draw and place a new tile for each unconnected edge, simulating line of sight. Applies to all tiles including Town Square and Helipad.

### Helipad Placement:
Players bid zombie trophies to place the Helipad. Highest bidder discards bid amount and places the tile adjacent to any road. Once placed, the 6 closest zombies move 3 spaces toward it at the end of each turn.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Combat
- **Melee**: Roll 1d6 when sharing space with a zombie. 4+ kills it; 1–3 loses 1 life and reroll continues.
- **Ranged**: Spend 1 bullet token. First roll must meet or exceed distance (e.g., 5 spaces = roll 5+). Second roll 4+ to hit.
- **Weapons Override**: Weapon effects (e.g., Chainsaw, Shotgun) replace base combat rules when in play.

### Weapons
- **Chainsaw, Fire Axe, Skateboard**: Use as described on card.
- **Shotgun**: Comes with 3 bullets (max 6). Ammo search possible in empty buildings: roll 5+ on 1d6, then second die determines ammo gained (1–2: 1 bullet, 3–4: 2, 5–6: 3).
- **Grenade**: One-time use. Choose direction, roll 1d6 for distance. Kills zombie in target space and adjacent spaces. Players (including user) in blast radius lose 2 life.
- **Molotov Cocktail**: One-time use. Same as grenade, but fire does not spread between street and building spaces.
- **Bounce Effect**: Grenades/Molotovs thrown into buildings bounce off walls. Lose 1 movement per bounce. Player chooses bounce direction.

### Event Cards
- Players hold max 3 cards.
- May play 1 card per round (from start of turn to start of next).
- Can be played at any time, even during another player’s turn.
- Location restrictions ignored.
- May discard 1 card at end of turn.

### Death & Respawning
- Upon death (last life lost): return to Town Square, lose half collected zombies (rounded up), discard active weapon, reset to 3 life and 3 bullets.
- Dropped weapon remains beside death space; retrievable by any player passing through.
- In solo play, players have 3 lives ("Shotgun Guy Lives"); losing all results in game loss.

### Player Interaction
- No direct player killing in standard rules.
- In competitive variants (e.g., Multiplayer Arena Blast), player vs. player combat is allowed.
- In cooperative mode, players may freely share weapons, bullets, life tokens, and event cards when on same space.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
