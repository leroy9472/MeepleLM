## Mille Bornes – Solo Variation: Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Mille Bornes – Solo*, you are a lone driver racing across the country through seven treacherous highways represented by card piles. Your goal is to clear all seven highways of obstacles, manage your fuel (the draw deck), and reach your destination with as many accumulated miles as possible. Victory means successfully navigating all highways before running out of gas.

**Primary Objective**: Clear all 7 highway card piles before the draw deck (gas tank) is exhausted. Maximize your score by collecting mile cards during play.

### 2. Components  
- Standard *Mille Bornes* deck of cards, including:
  - Distance cards (25, 50, 75, 100, 200 miles)
  - Hazard cards (e.g., Flat Tire, Out of Gas, Accident, Stop, Speed Limit)
  - Remedy cards (e.g., Spare Tire, Gasoline, Repairs, Go, End of Limit)
  - Safety cards (e.g., Driving Ace, Extra Tank, Puncture-Proof, Right of Way)
- No additional components required.

### 3. Setup  
1. Shuffle the full deck thoroughly.  
2. Create **seven face-down piles** of **seven cards each**, placed in a horizontal row. These are the **highways**.  
3. **Turn over the top card** of each highway pile so it is face-up.  
4. Deal **7 cards** to your hand.  
5. Place the **remaining cards** to the left of the highway row — this is the **Draw Deck** ("gas tank").  
6. Place the **discard pile** to the left of the draw deck.  
7. Game is now ready to begin.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, you may perform **any number of actions** in any order until you can no longer play or choose to stop. After actions, if unable to continue, follow the draw/discard rules.

#### Allowed Actions:
1. **Resolve Hazard/Remedy Pair (Hazard on Highway)**  
   - Play a **Remedy card** from your hand on a matching **Hazard card** visible on a highway pile.  
   - Discard both cards.  
   - Example: Play "Spare Tire" on "Flat Tire" → discard both.

2. **Resolve Remedy/Hazard Pair (Remedy on Highway)**  
   - Play a **Hazard card** from your hand on a matching **Remedy card** visible on a highway pile.  
   - Discard both cards.  
   - Example: Play "Out of Gas" on "Gasoline" → discard both.

3. **Match Distance Cards**  
   - Play a **Distance card** from your hand on a matching **Distance card** on a highway pile.  
   - Choose one of the two identical cards to place **in front of you** (counts toward score).  
   - Discard the other.  
   - Example: Play a 100-mile card from hand on a 100-mile card on a highway → keep one, discard one.

4. **Play Safety Card on 200-Distance Card (or vice versa)**  
   - Play a **Safety card** from your hand on a **200-mile card** on a highway pile.  
   - Place the **200-mile card in front of you** (counts toward score).  
   - Discard the **Safety card**.  
   - OR: Play a **200-mile card** from your hand on a **Safety card** on the highway.  
     - Place the 200-mile card in front of you, discard the Safety card.  
   - Either way, the 200-mile card is saved, Safety card is removed.

5. **Sacrifice Owned Distance Card to Clear Highway**  
   - Play a **Distance card** from in front of you (already claimed) on a **matching Distance card** on a highway.  
   - Discard **both cards**.  
   - This removes the highway card but **reduces your final score** by that amount.  
   - Example: Use your 100-mile card to clear a 100-mile card on a highway → both discarded, lose 100 points.

#### After Actions:
- If you **cannot play any more cards**:
  - If your hand has **fewer than 7 cards**, draw up to 7 from the draw deck and continue your turn.
  - If your hand has **exactly 7 cards** and still cannot play, **discard your entire hand**, then draw 7 new cards.

- A turn continues until:
  - All highways are cleared (win condition checked), OR
  - You choose to stop, OR
  - You discard and redraw but still cannot act, and the draw deck is empty.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Highway Piles**: 7 piles × 7 cards. Only the top card is visible and interactable. When a top card is removed, the next card is **not automatically revealed** — it remains face-down until the card above it is cleared.
- **Card Matching**: Only exact matches (by type and value) can be paired.
- **Card Types**:
  - **Distance Cards**: 25, 50, 75, 100, 200. Used to score points.
  - **Hazard Cards**: Flat Tire, Out of Gas, Accident, Stop, Speed Limit.
  - **Remedy Cards**: Spare Tire, Gasoline, Repairs, Go, End of Limit.
  - **Safety Cards**: Driving Ace, Extra Tank, Puncture-Proof, Right of Way. Only interact with 200-mile cards in this solo version.
- **Draw Deck = Gas Tank**: As long as cards remain, you can refill your hand. Running out = game over if highways remain.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Winning the Game:
- You win if **all 7 highway piles are completely cleared** (all 49 cards removed) **and** the draw deck still has **at least one card remaining**.
- After winning:
  - Tally all **Distance cards in front of you**.
  - This total is your **final score**.

#### Losing the Game:
- You lose if the **draw deck is empty** and you are unable to continue your turn (even after discarding and redrawing).
- This can happen even if you have actions left but no cards to draw.
- Loss occurs **if any highway pile still has cards** (face-up or face-down) when the draw deck runs out.

#### Scoring Recap:
- Each **Distance card kept** (in front of you) is worth its face value.
- Discarded or sacrificed Distance cards **do not count**.
- No additional bonuses mentioned in solo rules.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: When a card is removed from a highway pile, is the next card revealed?**  
A: No. The next card remains face-down and is only accessible once the card above it is cleared. You do not flip it unless it becomes the top card through removal of prior cards.

**Q: Can I play multiple actions in a single turn?**  
A: Yes. You may perform as many valid actions as possible in a single turn.

**Q: Can I play a Safety card on any 200-mile card, regardless of color or type?**  
A: Yes. The rules imply any Safety card can pair with any 200-mile card on a highway pile.

**Q: Can I use a Safety card from the table (already played) to clear a highway?**  
A: No. Only cards in your hand or on the highway may be used in pairing. Cards in front of you are only Distance cards used for scoring or sacrifice.

**Q: What happens if I discard my hand and draw 7 new cards, but still can't play?**  
A: You may repeat the process only if the draw deck still has cards. If the draw deck is empty, the game ends in loss.

**Q: Do I have to clear all cards in a highway pile to move to the next?**  
A: No. You can act on any visible top card of any highway pile in any order.
