- Shuffle Action Deck and place beside board.  
- Sort Economics Cards into 5 piles (Factories, Minerals, Oil, Rail Transport, Population), ordered by level (1–4).

**Step 3: Place Units**  
- **Capitals:** In turn order, each player places capital in a region bordering a sea zone (not Arctic Circle). Next player must choose different continent.  
- **Army Units:** Place starting units in capital and up to two adjacent regions (same continent, connected by land, anchor, or sea lane).  
- **Navy Units:** Place all navy units on coastline of capital region (not in sea zone).  

**Step 4: Neutral Regions**  
- Place facedown Government Markers on all unoccupied regions.  

**Step 5: Turn Order**

- Starting player chooses clockwise or counterclockwise turn order.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each year has four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter.  
- **Spring–Autumn:** Each player takes one action per season (3 total).  
- **Winter:** Optional Burn action allows extra action.  

**Action Options (choose one per season):**  
1. **Move:** Move army units one region each; fight battles if entering neutral/opposing regions.  
2. **Blitz:** Attack one hostile region; tanks and planes may move up to 3 regions to join.  
3. **Navigate:** Move navy units; embark/disembark army units.  
4. **Transport:** Move army units between controlled regions via land or sea lanes.  
5. **Negotiate:** Convert adjacent neutral region (cost depends on government alignment).  
6. **Build:** Collect income (1 Production per controlled region + Population cards); build units.  
7. **Research:** Gain tech by discarding units per card requirements.  
8. **Burn:** Discard 5 Oil Certificates or remove 1 Oil Marker to take a fourth action in Winter.  

**Turn Sequence (Spring–Autumn):**  
1. Starting player takes action.  
2. Play proceeds in turn order.  
3. After all players act, season advances.  
4. Repeat until Spring, Summer, Autumn completed.  
5. Winter: Each player may Burn to take another action.  
6. Year ends: Collect income if no Build taken; clear action markers; advance year.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### **Battles**  
Triggered when units enter neutral or enemy region/sea zone during Move, Blitz, or Navigate.  

**Army Battle Steps:**  
1. **Deploy (Turn 1):**  
   - Defender sets 4 units in battle line (or all if fewer).  
   - Attacker does same.  
   - Remaining units are reserve.  
   - *Opening Salvo:* Attacker with Artillery may fire first (only Artillery roll).  

2. **Re-deploy (Turn 2+):**  
   - After each round, acting player may add 1 more unit to line (max increases by 1 each turn).  
   - Must fill line to maximum possible.  

3. **Fire:**  
   - Acting player rolls one Army Die per unit in line.  
   - Carrier in navy battle provides Air Support: rolls one Army Die in addition to Navy Die.  

4. **Hit or Miss:**  
   - One hit per die matching a unit in line.  
   - Only one die per unit.  
   - E.g., 2 Tanks rolled → 1 hit (only 1 Tank in line).  

5. **Destroy:**  
   - Acting player destroys one enemy unit per hit, following hierarchy:  
     - **Army:** Infantry → Artillery → Tanks → Planes  
     - **Navy:** Destroyer → Submarine → Carrier → Battleship  
   - If transport destroyed, carried unit is also destroyed (player may choose to lose non-transport unit first).  
   - If carrier destroyed, its Air Support die is lost.  
   - If region conquered, coastline navy units are destroyed.  

6. **Alternate Turns:**  
   - After destruction, other player becomes acting player and re-deploys.  
   - Continue until one side has no units left.  
   - No retreat allowed.  

**Victory Conditions:**  
- Winner controls region/sea zone.  
- Attacker takes one Government Marker from defender.  
- If capital captured, game ends.  

**Neutral Regions:**  
- Opponent chosen to represent neutral forces.  
- Rolls one Army Die per year number.  
- Units formed from results.  
- If attacker wins, gains control and marker.  
- If defender wins, region remains neutral.  
- Neutral units removed after battle.  

#### **Sea Battles (Special Rules)**  
- **Setup:** Both players place Navy cards face down (max 8), then reveal.  
- **Combat Order:** Resolve engagements left to right.  
- **Dice Roll:** Roll Navy Dice, add modifiers. Higher roll wins engagement. Tie = no hit.  
- **Hit Application:** Hit applied to **first unit in line-up**, not necessarily the one fighting.  
- **Exception:** Carrier vs Carrier — normal targeting applies.  
- **Battleships:** Take 2 hits; after first hit, rotate sideways (damaged).  
- **After All Engagements:** Remove damaged Battleships (not sunk); they cannot fight further.  
- **Retreat Option:** After round, players may pick up remaining ships and restart battle (step 1).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game
