## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

In *Infinite City*, players represent powerful corporations vying to control the world's largest and fastest-growing metropolis. The economy is booming, workers are flooding in, and the city is expanding rapidly. Your goal is to dominate the city by controlling the largest contiguous areas and securing key buildings.

**Objective**: Score the most points by controlling large, connected tile groups and valuable special buildings.

### 2. Components

- **120 Tiles**: Feature various city buildings with unique abilities.
- **6 Groups of 15 Colored Tokens**: One set per player (color-coded) used to claim control of tiles.
- **Rule Sheet**: This guide.

### 3. Setup

1. Each player takes 15 tokens in one color.
2. Shuffle all 120 tiles face down to form a draw deck.
3. Deal **5 tiles face down** to each player (starting hand).
4. Place **5 tiles face down** in a **PLUS (+) shape** in the center of the table (one central tile with one tile on each orthogonally adjacent side: up, down, left, right).
5. Randomly choose the first player.
6. Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

On your turn, follow these steps in order:

1. **Choose and Place a Tile**:
   - Select one tile from your hand.
   - Place it **face-up** on the table so that it is **orthogonally adjacent** to at least one already-placed tile (sides must fully align).
   - Immediately place **one of your tokens** on the tile you just placed.

2. **Resolve Tile Effects**:
   - Follow the instructions printed on the tile.
   - If placing your token causes a **face-down tile** to be claimed (e.g., Plaza, Salvage Yard), **flip it face-up** and resolve its effect.
   - If a tile effect causes **another tile to be played**, repeat the full procedure (place token, resolve effect, chain if needed).
   - Resolve each tile **completely** before moving to the next in a chain.

3. **Draw Tiles**:
   - After resolving all tile effects, **draw from the deck** until you have **5 tiles in hand**.
   - If you already have 5 or more, do not draw.

4. **End Turn**:
   - Pass play to the next player.

> **Note**: You **cannot** place a token without placing a tile unless a tile effect explicitly allows it (e.g., Hotel).

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Adjacency
- Only **orthogonal** (side-to-side) adjacency counts.
- Diagonal tiles are not adjacent.
- Tiles must fully align on a side to be adjacent.

#### Tile Placement Rules
- New tiles from hand must be placed adjacent to at least one existing tile.
- **Exception – Plaza Rule**: If any **Plaza** tile has an open side, **all new tiles from hands must be placed on an open Plaza side** if possible. This overrides normal placement rules.

#### Controlling Tiles
- A player **controls** a tile if they have **at least one token** on it.
- **Multiple players can control the same tile**.
- Control is used for **all scoring** and tile effects.

#### Tile Effects & Interactions
- **Face-down tiles**: Can be claimed by placing a token on them. Flip and resolve when claimed.
- **Power Station**:
  - Locks all **adjacent tiles and their tokens**.
  - No movement, flipping, or effect-based interaction with adjacent tiles or tokens.
  - **Exception**: Adding new tokens to face-down adjacent tiles is allowed (e.g., via Housing), but those tokens become locked once placed.
- **Transit Station**: Swap positions of two tiles (and all tokens on them). **Orientation (face-up/down) remains unchanged**.
- **Mausoleum**: Remove any tile from play (return all tokens to owners), place removed tile at the bottom of the draw pile. **You do not replace it**.
- **Disaster Site**: Same as Mausoleum — no tile replacement.
- **Hotel**: Players without tokens on the Hotel may **place a token here instead of placing a tile** on their turn.
- **Embassy**: Place a token on the Embassy, then return a token from an adjacent tile to its owner. If you cannot place the first token (e.g., last token used), the return effect **does not happen**.
- **Factory**: After drawing to fill your hand (even if you draw 0), draw **5 additional tiles** and keep them.
- **Capitol**: Play a tile from another player’s hand. That player draws a replacement **after** the tile is played and any exchanges (e.g., via Shopping Complex) occur.
- **Plaza**: Forces new tile placement onto its open sides. If moved, its effect reactivates if it has open sides.
- **Salvage Yard**: After placement, fill all open sides with **face-down tiles drawn randomly from players’ hands**, starting with other players. If open sides remain, the active player draws randomly from their own hand.

#### Moving Tokens and Tiles
- Moving a token **onto a face-up tile** does **not** trigger its effect.
- Moving a token **onto a face-down tile** **does** trigger its effect when flipped.
- Moving a tile (e.g., Transit Station) **does not** trigger its effect unless it is being placed or flipped.

#### Invalid Configurations
- Tile removal (e.g., Mausoleum, Disaster Site) can leave isolated or diagonally separated groups.
- There is **no requirement** to reconnect the city.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### End Game Triggers (Game ends immediately when either occurs):
1. **Any player places their last token**.
   - That player triggers endgame.
   - All **other players** get **one final turn**.
   - If a player has no tokens on their final turn, they are skipped.
   - Once triggered, game ends after final turns — even if tokens are returned.
2. **All five Power Stations are in play**.
   - Game ends **immediately**, no final turns.

#### Scoring

1. **Area Control (Contiguous Groups)**:
   - Score for each **contiguous group** of **3 or more orthogonally connected tiles** you control.
   - For each such group, score **1 point per tile** in the group.
   - A tile can be in only one group per player (use largest possible group).

2. **Bonus Points from Tile Values**:
   - Score **printed point values** on tiles you control (e.g., Power Stations, Police HQ).
   - These do **not** need to be in groups of 3.

3. **Silver-Bordered Ring Tiles**:
   - Identify tiles with **silver borders and rings** (e.g., Power Stations, Construction Site).
   - The player who controls the **most** such tiles gains a bonus equal to the **number they control**.
   - If tied, **all tied players** gain the full bonus.

> **Note**: All scoring is based on **control** (having at least one token), even if shared.

#### Winning
- Highest total score wins.
- **Tiebreaker**: The tied player with the **largest single contiguous group** wins.
- If still tied, continue to next-largest group, etc.

### 7. FAQ / Edge Cases

| Question | Answer |
|--------|--------|
| Can you place a tile that leaves disconnected city sections? | Yes. No reconnection required. |
| Does Power Station prevent flipping adjacent face-down tiles? | Yes. Cannot flip. |
| Can you add tokens to tiles adjacent to Power Station? | Yes, if placing new tokens (e.g., via Housing). |
| Does Transit Station preserve face-up/down status when swapping? | Yes. Orientation remains unchanged. |
| If Plaza is moved, does it reactivate? | Yes, if it has open sides. |
| If Embassy is played with last token, does return effect happen? | No. First effect must resolve. |
| Do you score tile points for isolated tiles? | Yes. Only area control requires groups of 3+. |
| Does Factory trigger if you already have 5+ tiles? | Yes. Draw 5 extra after normal draw step. |
| If Capitol lets you play from another’s hand, when do they draw? | After all effects (e.g., hand swap) — then draw. |
| Must you fulfill all tile text? | Yes, unless it says “you may.” |
| Can Mausoleum take face-down tiles? | Yes. Flip is not required. |
| If game ends due to last token, but token is returned, does game continue? | No. Endgame is final once triggered. |
| Who gets last turn if Player 2 causes Player 4 to place last token? | Order: 3 → 4 (skipped) → 1 → 2. |
| If Arboretum returns tokens after last placement, does game end? | Yes. Trigger is placing last token — even if returned later. |
