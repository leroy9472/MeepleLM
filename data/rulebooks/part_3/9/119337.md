## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Aeroplanes™ simulates the early era of commercial aviation (1919–1939), where players compete to build the most successful airline. The objective is to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) over three eras by establishing airport dominance across global regions, transporting passengers profitably, and managing resources efficiently. Victory is determined by combining VPs from end-game airplane and passenger tiles, with ties broken by remaining bonds (money).

### 2. Components  
- 46 Unique Aeroplane Cards  
- 96 Passenger Tiles (valued 1–3 VPs)  
- 40 Excess Passenger Tiles  
- 30 Advantage Tiles (6 each of 5 types)  
- 130 Airport Tiles (9 Stage I, 9 Stage II, 9 Stage III per player)  
- Bonds in £1, £22, and £32 denominations  
- 1 First Player Die (white)  
- 15 Engine Failure Tiles  
- 1 Cloth Bag  
- 5 Victory Point Tokens  
- 2 Game Tokens (Era and Subsidy)  
- 5 Home Airport Tiles  
- 5 Player Aid Cards  
- 3 Risk Dice (numbered 1–6 with skulls)  
- 1 Game Board

### 3. Setup  
1. **Passenger Tiles**: Place one tile in each of the six starting city sections (top-left of board). If a tile has a “×” icon, set it aside and draw again. Once all spaces are filled, return “×” tiles to the bag.  
2. **Aeroplane Cards**: Arrange cards 1–46 in order. Display the first 12 face-up.  
3. **Advantage Tiles**: Sort by number (2–6) and place face-up beside the board.  
4. **Engine Failure & Excess Capacity Tiles**: Place near the board.  
5. **Subsidy Box**: Place 8 £1 bonds and the black subsidy token.  
6. **Era Track**: Place one black token on “Era 1”.  
7. **First Player**: Randomly determine; give them the white die.  
8. **Home Airports**: Starting counterclockwise from the first player, each player places their home airport in an unoccupied starting city (London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris, Zürich, Rome).  
9. **Starting Money**: Each player receives £12, adjusted by the modifier shown next to their home city (e.g., Berlin +2 → £14).  
10. **VP Track**: All players start at 0.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each era consists of:  
1. **Income Phase**  
2. **Action Rounds**  
3. **End of Era Scoring**  
4. **End of Era Upkeep**  

#### Income Phase  
- **Era 1**: £12 (modified by home city)  
- **Era 2**: £22 (unmodified)  
- **Era 3**: £32 (unmodified)  
- Refill subsidy box with 8 £1 bonds.

#### Action Rounds  
Players take turns clockwise. Each player takes **one action per round** from the following:  
1. **Buy One Aeroplane Card**  
2. **Place Airport Tiles**  
3. **Claim One Passenger Tile**  
4. **Buy Advantage Tiles**  
5. **Take a Subsidy**  

After all players act, the first player rolls the white die. Pass the die clockwise by the number rolled; that player becomes the new first player.  
The action round ends when a player takes the **black subsidy token** (after all £1 bonds are gone). This triggers End of Era procedures.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### 1. Buy One Aeroplane Card  
- Pay face value of the card.  
- For each card skipped in line, add £1 to cost.  
- Immediately place airport tiles (Stage I, II, or III) on the card as indicated.  
- Draw the next card to maintain 12 on display.  
- **Card Color Indicates Stage**: Yellow = Stage I, Green = Stage II, Blue = Stage III.

#### 2. Place Airport Tiles  
- Place any number of your airport tiles in one action.  
- **Standard Placement**: Must be adjacent via white path to an existing airport.  
- **Special Connections**: North America, Casablanca, Cairo, Middle East are connected to all European cities.  
- **Long-Distance Aeroplanes (LDA)**: Required for routes marked with “” symbol (e.g., Ethiopia-India). LDAs allow skipping over cities (e.g., Frankfurt → Madrid via Paris).  
- **Risk Dice Rolls Required** for:  
  - Red connections: 12+ total (3 dice)  
  - Black connections: 14+ total (3 dice)  
  - Skulls ( ) count as engine failures, not 1s.  
- **Modifiers**:  
  - Opponent’s airport at destination: +2 to roll  
  - Opponent’s airport at skipped city (LDA): +2 to first roll  
- **Failure**:  
  - Pay £1 per pip short to succeed.  
  - If unable to pay or roll fails, return airport tile to supply and end turn.  
  - Each skull rolled = 1 Engine Failure tile.  
  - **4 Engine Failure tiles**: Discard all, return attempted airport to supply, turn ends.  
- **Advantage Tiles Help**:  
  - *Daring Pilot*: +3 per tile (after roll, multiple usable)  
  - *Radio Beacons*: Reroll all 3 dice (ignore previous skulls)  
- **Placement Rules**:  
  - Max one airport per player per city.  
  - Empty space must be used if available.  
  - Full spaces: Replace lower-stage airport (I → II or III, II → III).  
  - **Home airport may never be replaced**.

#### 3. Claim One Passenger Tile  
To claim from **waiting area**:  
- Must have airport at **origin city** (passenger space)  
- Must have airport at **destination city**  
- Must have an airplane with **sufficient unused capacity**  
- Passenger tiles may go to different destinations on same plane  
- **Cannot split** a passenger’s capacity across planes  

To claim from **overflow area** (Eras 2–3):  
- Only need airport at **destination city**

**Bonus**: First two players to place in **North or South America** get £3 and 1 VP. Replacing someone does not grant bonus.

#### 4. Buy Advantage Tiles  
- Pay £1 to bank. Choose:  
  - Take 1 tile of choice, or  
  - Roll 3 risk dice: Take up to 2 tiles matching die results. Skulls are wild.  
- Unavailable results yield no tile.  
- Tiles:  
  - **Daring Pilot (2)**: +3 to non-Europe placement rolls. Use after roll. Multiple usable. (Era 1+)  
  - **Engine Maintenance (3)**: Discard all Engine Failure tiles. Must use at **start of turn**. (Era 1+)  
  - **Increased Production (4)**: Add 1 extra airport tile when buying a plane. Only one per purchase. (Era 2+)  
  - **Night Flights (5)**: Claim extra passenger (must be to Europe). Multiple usable. (Era 2+)  
  - **Radio Beacons (6)**: Reroll all dice when placing airports. Ignore previous skulls. (Era 3 only)  
- Used tiles return to supply.

#### 5. Take a Subsidy  
- Take £1 from subsidy box.  
- When no bonds left, next player **must take black token**, ending the era.  
- That player gets first player die for next era.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End of Era Scoring  
**1. Area Control (Most Airports in Markets)**  
- Markets: Europe, Africa, Asia/Australasia  
- 1st place: Higher VP value on board chart  
- 2nd place: Lower VP value  
- Tie for 1st: All tied get higher value; no 2nd  
- Tie for 2nd: All tied get lower value  

**2. Airline Profitability**  
- Profit = Total passengers carried – Unused capacity on purchased planes  
- Top 3 scores get VPs as per chart (e.g., 5/3/1)  
- Tie: Combine VP values, split equally (round down). Players below are pushed down.  
  - Example: Two tied for 1st → both get (5+3)/2 = 4 VPs; next scores 1st place value  

#### End of Era Upkeep  
1. Discard 2 lowest-numbered aeroplane cards; replace from deck.  
2. Discard fully used aeroplane cards to personal pile.  
3. Flip cards with unused capacity; mark with excess passenger tiles.  
4. Move used airport tiles to back of flipped cards (usable in future).  
5. Set aside VP-earning passenger tiles (score at game end). 0 VP tiles removed.  
6. Move 1 non-European passenger per starting city to overflow (max 8).  
7. Refill passenger waiting area starting from Rome, clockwise.  
8. Give new era income (£22 or £32).  
9. Advance era token.  
10. Player who took subsidy token rolls first player die for next era.

#### End of Game  
- Game ends after Era 3.  
- Score VPs from:  
  - Discarded aeroplane cards (VPs printed)  
  - Passenger tiles with VPs (from used planes)  
- Add to running total.  
- **Winner**: Highest VP total. Tiebreaker: Most bonds.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use multiple advantage tiles?**  
  Yes, except Increased Production (only one per plane). Daring Pilot and Night Flights can be stacked.  
- **Can I claim a passenger if origin = destination?**  
  Yes. Only need airport at that city.  
- **Can I place airports during same action after failing a roll?**  
  No. Failed roll (without payment) or 4 engine failures ends turn.  
- **Can I use Engine Maintenance after placing a tile?**  
  No. Must be used at **start of turn**, before any action.  
- **Do unused capacity markers count against profit in future eras?**  
  No. Only capacity on **newly purchased** planes in that era counts.  
- **Can I skip purchasing a plane to save money?**  
  Yes. You may take any action, including taking subsidy or passing via forced token.
