## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *La Strada*, players are ambitious Italian merchants during the Renaissance, competing to build trade networks across northern Italy. The goal is to dominate settlements—cities, towns, villages, and hamlets—by connecting them with roads from your workshops and placing merchant cubes. Victory is achieved by earning the most gold through strategic expansion and market control. The game emphasizes balancing reach, resource management, and competition.

### 2. Components  
- **Board**: Composed of 4 edge pieces, 4 connectors, and 6 land tiles assembled randomly.  
- **19 Settlement Tiles**:  
  - 4 Cities (most valuable)  
  - 5 Towns  
  - 5 Villages  
  - 5 Hamlets (least valuable)  
- **Road Tiles (124 total)**:  
  - 80 Plains (18 per color × 4)  
  - 32 Forest (8 per color × 4)  
  - 20 Hills (5 per color × 4)  
  - Tiles are double-sided: straight on one side, curved on the other.  
- **Workshop Tiles (8)**: 2 per player color (used fully in 2-player game).  
- **Merchant Cubes (48)**: 12 wooden cubes per player color (4 colors).  
- **Resource Markers (4)**: One per player, used on resource tracks.  
- **Resource Tracks**: Printed on the board edges, numbered 0–10.

### 3. Setup  
1. Assemble the board frame using 4 edge pieces and 4 connectors.  
2. Randomly place the 6 land tiles into the frame (include the longer starting tile).  
3. Shuffle the 19 settlement tiles face-down and place one on each grey dot; then flip them face-up.  
4. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
   - 2 workshop tiles (in 2-player game)  
   - 18 Plains, 8 Forest, 5 Hill road tiles of their color  
   - 12 merchant cubes  
   - 1 resource marker  
5. Place resource markers at "0" on the resource track.  
6. Determine starting player randomly (e.g., draw a workshop tile).  
7. **Workshop Placement (2-player only)**:  
   - Players alternate placing workshops:  
     - Player A places first workshop.  
     - Player B places first workshop.  
     - Player A places second workshop.  
     - Player B places second workshop.  
   - Workshops must be placed on **plain hexes only**.  
   - No two workshops may be adjacent (at least one hex between).  
8. **Round Tracker (Danger Style variant)**: Place a neutral-colored cube on the "10" of a resource track to count down rounds.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **10 rounds** in the Danger Style variant; otherwise, it ends conditionally.

#### Turn Sequence (per player):  
1. **Gain Resources**: Add 6 resources to your track (maximum: 10). Excess is lost.  
2. **Build Roads**:  
   - Spend resources to place road tiles from your network (workshop or connected settlement) to **newly reachable settlements**.  
   - Roads must:  
     - Match terrain (Plains, Forest, Hill).  
     - Form a continuous, unbroken path.  
     - Connect to **one new settlement** per turn (you may build multiple paths, but only one settlement can be newly connected).  
   - Tile Costs:  
     - Plains: 2 resources  
     - Forest: 3 resources  
     - Hill: 4 resources  
   - You may build in multiple directions, but all placed tiles must contribute to connecting **at least one new settlement**.  
   - Cannot place tiles without connecting a new settlement.  
3. **Place Merchant Cube**:  
   - Place **one** merchant cube on the newly connected settlement.  
   - You may **not** place a cube on a settlement that already has one of your cubes.  
   - Multiple players may have cubes on the same settlement.  
4. **Optional Network Expansion**:  
   - From any settlement where you have a cube, you may extend roads in future turns—even if already connected.  
   - In 2-player standard rules: you may **reconnect** to a settlement that already has your cube to extend from it (without placing another cube).  
5. **End Turn**: Next player takes their turn.

**Danger Style Variant Rules**:  
- Game lasts exactly 10 rounds.  
- Player who placed the last warehouse (workshop) goes first.  
- Players can only build roads from settlements where they have a merchant cube.  
- When building a road, you may transfer any number of cubes between the origin and destination settlement **during that turn**.  
- You may build a road to a settlement **without transferring cubes** (e.g., for blocking), but then **cannot extend** from that settlement.  
- You may connect to a settlement even if already connected before.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Resource Management**: Max 10 resources; gain 6 per turn; spend to place tiles.  
- **Network Expansion**: Roads must originate from workshop or controlled settlement and connect to a **new** settlement.  
- **Tile Placement**: Must match terrain; no stacking; permanent once placed.  
- **Merchant Placement**: One per player per settlement; placed immediately after connection.  
- **Blocking & Strategy**: Use roads to block opponents or deny high-value markets.  
- **Cube Transfer (Danger Style)**: Optional movement between origin and destination when building a road; enables dynamic positioning.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Conditions:  
- **Standard 2-Player Rules**: Game ends when **all 19 settlements have a merchant cube**.  
- **Danger Style Variant**: Game ends after **10 rounds**.  
- **General Rule (3–4 player)**: Game ends when a player cannot connect to any new settlement at the start of their turn (no available settlements, no cubes, or no tiles).  

#### Scoring Procedure:  
1. Move all merchant cubes from each settlement to the appropriate scoring section on the board edge.  
2. Score gold based on **settlement type** and **number of merchants** present:  

| Settlement | Merchants | Gold per Merchant | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------------|------|
| **City** | 1 | 5 | Max 1 merchant scores full |
|          | 2 | 4 | Each earns 4 |
|          | 3 | 3 | Each earns 3 |
|          | 4 | 2 | Each earns 2 |
| **Town** | 1 | 4 | |
|          | 2 | 3 | |
|          | 3 | 2 | |
|          | 4 | 1 | |
| **Village** | 1 | 3 | |
|             | 2 | 2 | |
|             | 3 | 1 | |
|             | 4 | 0 | No score |
| **Hamlet** | 1 | 2 | |
|            | 2 | 1 | Each earns 1 |
|            | 3+ | 0 | No score |

> **Note**: In **2-player standard rules**, scoring uses the above table. In **Danger Style**, use simplified scoring:  
> - **Each merchant scores fixed value**:  
>   - City: 5  
>   - Town: 4  
>   - Village: 3  
>   - Hamlet: 2  
> - **Tie**: Neither player scores for that settlement.  

3. **Penalty for Unused Cubes (Danger Style only)**:  
   - Each merchant cube remaining in a player’s **warehouse** scores **–1 point**.  

4. **Final Score**: Sum all gold from settlements and apply penalties.  

#### Tiebreaker:  
- **Standard Rules**: Player with most remaining resources wins.  
- **Danger Style**: Not specified—assume standard tiebreaker applies.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build multiple roads in one turn?**  
  Yes, as long as they connect to **one new settlement** and originate from your network.  
- **Can I pass my turn?**  
  No. If you cannot connect a new settlement, the game ends (in standard rules). In Danger Style, you must still take your turn.  
- **Can I place a road to a settlement I already have a cube in?**  
  Yes, but only to **extend your network**—you do **not** place another cube. Only in 2-player standard rules.  
- **Can I build through another player’s road?**  
  No. You may not place tiles on occupied spaces. You may only connect via your own roads or shared settlements.  
- **What happens if I run out of road tiles?**  
  You cannot place roads requiring that terrain. This may trigger end game.  
- **Can I transfer cubes without building?**  
  No. Cube transfer is only allowed **during a road-building action**, and only between origin and destination.
