# Across Five Aprils — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Across Five Aprils is a collection of five standalone wargames simulating pivotal battles of the American Civil War: First Bull Run, Pea Ridge, Shiloh, Gettysburg, and Bentonville. Each game uses the same core mechanics but includes unique rules reflecting the historical conditions of that battle.

The objective varies by scenario but generally involves controlling Objective Hexes (OHs) and/or achieving a favorable Victory Point (VP) ratio based on enemy casualties. Victory is determined at specific points during or at the end of the game, depending on the scenario.

### 2. Components
- Two 22" x 32" map sheets (one per battle, with multiple scenarios per map)
- 352 playing pieces:
  - Combat units (infantry, cavalry, artillery, and gunboats in Shiloh)
  - Markers:
    - Game Turn Marker
    - Movement Phase Markers (by formation, color-coded)
    - Combat Phase Markers (Union and Confederate)
    - Objective Hex Control Markers (with Union and Confederate flags)
    - Fortification Markers (Breastwork and Entrenchment)
- Two identical Player Aid Cards containing:
  - Terrain Effects Chart (TEC)
  - Attacker's and Defender's Combat Results Tables (CRTs)
  - Morale Check Table (MCT)
  - Retreat Priorities and Prohibitions
  - Sequence of Play Summary
- Two 6-sided dice

### 3. Setup
- Place the Game Turn Marker in the Turn 1 space on the Turn Record Track (TRT).
- Set up units on the map according to their printed setup hex or place reinforcements on the TRT in the turn they arrive.
- Place Objective Hex Control Markers on all OHs per scenario setup (e.g., Union controls all OHs in Pea Ridge at start).
- Place Phase Markers (Movement and Combat) into the Phase Marker Cup per rules for the specific scenario (e.g., in Bull Run, Combat Phase Markers enter on Turn 2).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game turn consists of three segments:

1. **Phase Marker Cup Segment**  
   - All currently active Movement Phase Markers (from formations with units on-map) and any new ones arriving this turn are placed into the Phase Marker Cup.  
   - Combat Phase Markers due to arrive this turn are also added.

2. **Operations Segment**  
   - Players alternate drawing markers from the cup (Confederacy first).  
   - If a **Movement Phase Marker** is drawn, the owning player may move all units of that formation.  
   - If a **Combat Phase Marker** is drawn, that side conducts its Combat Phase (all eligible attacks resolved).  
   - All Automatic Retreats must be resolved before regular combats.  
   - Continue until the cup is empty.

3. **Game Turn Advancement Segment**  
   - Advance the Game Turn Marker one space on the TRT.  
   - If the turn has "Victory Determination," check for victory.  
   - In Pea Ridge, Shiloh, and Gettysburg, check for victory at the end of each day.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Movement
- Each unit has a Movement Allowance (MA) in Movement Points (MPs).
- MPs are spent based on terrain entered and hexside crossed (per TEC).
- Moving along a road, track, or railroad allows ignoring terrain cost and paying only the road/trail/RR cost.
- A unit can always move at least one hex per Movement Phase unless terrain is prohibited.
- Artillery and cavalry cannot cross embankments; artillery cannot enter swamp.
- Units stop when entering an enemy Zone of Control (ZOC).
- Units beginning in enemy ZOC may move out if they do not enter another enemy ZOC.
- Stacking limit: 2 units per hex voluntarily. Overstacking only via retreat.

#### Zones of Control (ZOCs)
- Each unit exerts a ZOC into all six adjacent hexes.
- ZOCs do not extend across river hexsides unless there is a bridge or ford.
- ZOCs do not extend into fortified hexes across breastwork or entrenchment hexsides.
- ZOCs are mutually exerted between adjacent enemy units.

#### Combat
- Triggered when a **Combat Phase Marker** is drawn.
- **Combat Restrictions**:
  - All enemy units exerting ZOC into friendly-occupied hexes must be attacked (or Automatic Retreat declared).
  - All friendly units in enemy ZOC must attack or conduct Automatic Retreat.
  - No unit may attack or be attacked more than once per Combat Phase.
  - Automatic Retreats resolved before regular combats.

- **Combat Resolution Procedure**:
  1. **Organize Combat**: Declare attackers and targets. Units in same hex may attack separate targets; stacked defenders must be attacked as a group.
  2. **Automatic Retreat Option**: Attacker may retreat all units one hex without loss. Defender may then advance one unit per vacated hex.
  3. **Compute Initial Odds**: Total Attack Strength ÷ Total Defense Strength (round down). Treat <1-4 as 1-4; >6-1 as 6-1.
  4. **Determine Final Odds**:
     - Shift odds column based on defender's terrain (per TEC).
     - Hill shift only applies if no attacker is on adjacent connected hill hex.
     - Hexside terrain shifts apply if all attackers cross that terrain; cumulative with hex terrain.
     - -1 column if all attackers are surrounded by enemy units/ZOCs.
     - +1 column if all defenders are surrounded by enemy units/ZOCs.
     - Max 3 column shifts in either direction.
  5. **Choose Morale Ratings**: Attacker declares a Morale Rating from among attacking units; defender does the same. Bombarding artillery morale cannot be used unless it's a Bombardment Attack.
  6. **Roll and Resolve**: Both players roll a die, add Morale Rating. Attacker uses Attacker's CRT; defender uses Defender's CRT. If final odds <1-4, attacker does not roll; defender rolls on 1-4 column.

- **Applying Combat Results** (simultaneously, but apply to defender first):
  1. **Apply Step Losses**: First step loss must go to a unit with declared Morale Rating. Remaining losses assigned freely.
  2. **Mandatory Retreats**: On "R" result, retreat all surviving units one hex.
  3. **Morale Checks**: If any unit lost a step, all participating units (except bombarding artillery) must make a Morale Check (die roll + Morale Rating). Fail = retreat one hex.
  4. **Voluntary Retreats**: Defender may retreat non-retreating units.

#### Retreat
- Reasons: failed Morale Check, Mandatory Retreat, Voluntary Retreat, or Automatic Retreat.
- Retreat not considered movement; no MP cost.
- **Retreat Prohibitions**:
  - Cannot retreat into:
    - Enemy-occupied hex
    - Hex in enemy ZOC without a friendly unit
    - Hex with prohibited terrain
- **Retreat Priorities** (in order):
  1. Hex not in enemy ZOC (or with friendly unit if no alternative)
  2. Direction of friendly lines (per Retreat Compass)
  3. Avoid stacking violation
  4. Farthest from most enemy units
- **Extended Retreat**: Required for Automatic Retreats (must retreat until not in enemy ZOC) or overstacking (until not overstacked).
- **Morale Check on Retreat**: If retreating into enemy ZOC, roll Morale Check. Fail = step loss. Repeat for each such hex.
- **Unable to Retreat**: Each hex a unit cannot retreat = one step loss.

#### Advance
- **Eligible**:
  - Attacking unit if all defenders eliminated, forced to retreat, or voluntarily retreat.
  - Defending unit if attacker conducts Automatic Retreat.
- **Restrictions**:
  - Only one unit may advance per vacated hex.
  - Artillery cannot advance.
  - Cannot advance if the advancing unit itself must retreat.
  - Advance is immediate and cannot be delayed.

#### Artillery
- Can attack adjacent hexes or **Bombard** up to 4 hexes away with Line of Sight (LOS).
- **Bombardment Restrictions**:
  - Cannot bombard if in enemy ZOC.
  - Cannot bombard if it retreated this Combat Phase.
- **Range Attenuation**: Attack strength halved (rounded down) at range >1 hex.
- **LOS Rules**:
  - Traced center-to-center.
  - Blocked by embankments, towns, woods, hills, wooded-hills.
  - Not blocked if along hexside with one non-blocking hex.
  - Units do not block LOS.
- **Bombardment Attack**: Sole artillery attack; defender does not roll; no combat results to artillery; stream/creek/river shifts ignored.
- **Combined Attack**: Artillery joins adjacent attack; immune to results; cannot use artillery’s Morale Rating.

#### Reinforcements
- Units enter on specified turn and at designated entry hex (letter on unit matches map).
- Owner may delay entry to next turn.
- Enter by paying MP cost for entry hex; may enter stacked (up to 2).
- Can enter hex in enemy ZOC, but not enemy-occupied hex.
- If entry hex blocked, enter in closest unblocked hex (except Shiloh: Union reinforcements cannot enter if blocked).
- Multiple entry options (e.g., C/D) allow units to enter at different hexes.

#### Night Turns
- No Combat Phase; no Combat Phase Markers in cup.
- Unit cannot enter enemy ZOC unless hex is occupied by friendly unit.
- Can leave enemy ZOC if not entering another.

#### Fortifications
- Types: Breastwork (1-column shift), Entrenchment (2-column shift + +1 step loss unless no effect).
- Placed along three hexsides; permanent once placed.
- ZOCs do not extend into fortification hex across fortified hexside.
- Combat shifts apply only if all attackers cross fortified hexside.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Victory determined per scenario-specific rules at designated turns.
- **Objective Hex Control**:
  - Controlled by side with:
    1. Unit occupying hex
    2. Unit projecting ZOC into hex (if only one side)
    3. Last unit to move through hex (if unoccupied and no ZOC control)
  - Use Control Markers to track.
- **Victory Points (VPs)**:
  - 2-step unit eliminated: 3 VP
  - 1-step unit eliminated: 2 VP
  - 2-step unit reduced by one step: 1 VP
- Some scenarios use VP ratio (Confederate VP : Union VP) to determine victory level.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Overstacking**: Only via retreat. Overstacked units do not count in defense, cannot attack, but suffer all combat results. Must be moved at first opportunity.
- **Simultaneous Column Shifts**: If both attacker and defender are surrounded, shifts cancel out.
- **Bombarding Artillery in Combat**: Immune to all results; does not make Morale Checks; cannot be assigned step losses.
- **Gunboats (Shiloh)**: Function as artillery; immune to all combat results when attacking; can only be attacked by Confederate bombarding artillery.
- **Retreat into Overstacked Hex**: Permitted; triggers Extended Retreat if possible.
- **Multiple Retreat Reasons**: Unit may retreat up to two hexes (Mandatory Retreat + failed Morale Check).
- **ZOC Tracing Over Rivers**: Only across bridges or fords.
