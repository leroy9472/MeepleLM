### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn proceeds in four phases:  

#### 1. Movement Phase  
- Roll the movement die.  
- Move up to that number of spaces in any direction.  
- The die result also determines energy available this turn (number of symbols rolled).  
- **Restriction**: Cannot enter a space with a color higher than current level. Cities are always considered grey.  

#### 2. Exploration Phase  
- Reveal and resolve **all discovery tokens** in your current space, in any order.  
  - Red-background tokens: resolve immediately and discard.  
  - Green-background tokens: keep for later use (retain in hand).  
- If no discovery tokens, **activate one resource** in the space (e.g., Scroll, Healing Potion).  
- Cannot use resources if discoveries are present.  

#### 3. Challenge Phase  
- **In a city?** Skip this phase.  
- Otherwise, **must do one of the following**:  
  - Attack another character in your space, OR  
  - Resolve a challenge (encounter or event) in your space.  
- If no existing challenge, draw a challenge card from the **bottom** of the deck matching your space’s color.  
  - **Event card**: Resolve front side, then draw again until an **encounter** is drawn.  
  - **Encounter card**: Immediately battle it.  
- **Aggro Encounters**: If an undefeated encounter marker is red-side up (Aggro), you **must** fight it if able.  
- **Event Types**:  
  - **Global**: Place on global event space; replace any existing global event.  
  - **Location**: Place on specified key location; discard any existing event there.  
  - **Special**: Resolve immediately.  

#### 4. Maintenance Phase  
Perform in order:  
1. **Quest Maintenance**: Fulfill "Travel" or "Collect" conditions if in required space.  
2. **Equip Items**: Equip/unequip one weapon and/or one armor. Unequipped items go under bag token.  
3. **Pass Movement Die**: Pass die to player on the left to begin next turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Combat  
Combat occurs during Challenge Phase.  

**Steps of Combat**:  
1. **Roll Combat Dice**:

2. **Trigger Special Powers**:  
   - Defender resolves first if both trigger.  
   - Powers triggered by die results activate automatically.  
3. **Ranged Combat**:  
   - Ranged attacker adds die roll to ranged attack value.  
   - If total ≥ target’s defense, deals damage equal to damage value.  
   - Ranged attacks resolve before melee.  
4. **Melee Combat**:  
   - Survivors from ranged step proceed.  
   - Melee attacker adds die roll to melee attack value.  
   - If total ≥ defense, deals damage.

   - **Encounter defeated, character not**: Gain item from back of card.
