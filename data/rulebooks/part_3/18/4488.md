## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Dark Pharaoh has fallen, and the noble houses of Hekumet vie for control of the realm. The land is split into two regions—Upper and Lower Hekumet—each divided into three columns: Military, Religious, and Economic.  

**Objective**: Win by achieving supremacy in at least two of the three columns in **both** regions at the beginning of your turn.  
Alternatively, win immediately if your opponent has no cards left in their deck at the beginning of your turn.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board between players.  
2. Each player takes one main deck (Ankar or Temet), shuffles it, and places it face-down.  
3. Set aside the 24-card bonus deck (not used in basic game).  
4. Each player draws 6 cards for their starting hand.  
5. Place scarab counters and pyramids near the board.  
6. Randomly determine who goes first.  

**Note**: The first player on their very first turn may only complete **two** of the four phases (player’s choice).

3. **Phase 2**: Take **one** Phase 2 action (or pass).  
4. **Supremacy Phase (S)**:

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Types  
- **Minions**: Played into matching columns. Have power value. Remain in play until discarded.  
- **Buildings**: Like minions, but often higher power and may enter play with scarabs.  
- **Leaders**: Played into matching columns. Only **one leader per column** allowed.  
- **Gods**:  
  - Played in the **center** of the board (not in columns).  
  - Max **3 gods in play** at once. Playing a 4th requires discarding one.  
  - Only **one player can have gods in play**. If you play a god, opponent discards **all** their gods.  
  - Gods are **immediately activated** when played.  
- **Fate**: One-time effects. Played from hand, resolved immediately, then discarded.  

#### Card Anatomy  
Each card has:  
1. Title  
2. Power value  
3. Phase (0, 1, 2, or S) – when it can be played/activated  
4. Column icons (Military, Religious, Economic) – where it can be played  
5. Type (Minion, Building, Leader, God, Fate)  
6. Text (special abilities; italicized flavor text has no effect)  

#### Actions (one per action phase)  
On your turn, you may take actions during Phase 0, 1, or 2. Each action is **one** of:  
- **Play a Card**  
- **Activate a Card**  
- **Uncurse a Card**  

##### Play a Card  
- Must be played during its listed phase.  
- Minions, buildings, leaders: played into a column matching one of its icons.  
- Only one leader per column. To play a new leader, discard the existing one.  
- Gods: played to center; opponent discards all gods in play; your god is activated.  
- Fate: effect resolves immediately; card discarded.  

##### Activate a Card  
- Only cards with **"Action:"** text can be activated.  
- Can only be activated during the card’s listed phase.  
- One activation per action.  

##### Uncurse a Card  
- Spend an action to remove **one scarab counter** from a card you control.  
- Can only be done during the card’s phase.  
- Multiple scarabs may require multiple actions to fully uncurse.  

#### Scarabs and Cursing  
- A **cursed card** (has ≥1 scarab) has **zero power** and **no text effects**.  
- You may curse a card already cursed (adds another scarab, no extra effect).  
- To **un-curse**, remove scarabs one at a time via actions.  
- **Religious Supremacy** allows you to **curse an opponent’s card** in the same region.  

#### Supremacy Phase  
**Step 1: Determine Supremacy (in each column)**  
- Total power of **uncursed** minions, buildings, and leaders on each side.  
- Player with higher total claims supremacy. Place pyramid on their side.  
- **Tie**: No supremacy. Remove pyramid if present.  

**Step 2: Exercise Supremacy (for each column you control)**  
You may choose to exercise any or all supremacies you hold.  

- **Military Supremacy**: Opponent discards top card of deck.  
- **Religious Supremacy**: Curse one of opponent’s cards (minion, building, leader) in the **same region** (place scarab counter).  
- **Economic Supremacy**: Draw one card.  

**Note**: You may exercise the same type of supremacy twice (e.g., both Economic columns) if you control both.  
Supremacy only changes during the Supremacy Phase.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends **at the start of your turn** if either condition is met:  

1. You have supremacy in **at least two of the three columns** in **both** Upper and Lower Hekumet → **You win**.  
2. Your opponent has **no cards left in their deck** → **You win**.  

Supremacy is checked **before** any actions are taken on your turn.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a card and activate it on the same turn?**  
  Yes, if it's during its phase. Playing it activates passive effects; you may also use an action to activate its "Action:" ability if applicable.  

- **What happens if I play a god when I already have three?**  
  You must immediately discard one of your three gods to stay within the limit.  

- **Can I have gods if my opponent has none?**  
  Yes. Only one player may have gods in play at a time. If you play one, opponent discards theirs (if any).  

- **Can I exercise supremacy in a column I just lost?**  
  No. Supremacy is determined **at the end of your turn**. You only exercise supremacy in columns you currently control.  

- **Does cursing a card remove its power immediately?**  
  Yes. Cursed cards contribute 0 power and have no abilities.  

- **Can I uncurse a card during a different phase than its listed phase?**  
  No. You can only uncurse a card during its specific phase (e.g., Phase 2 card → only during Phase 2).  

- **Can I curse a god with Religious Supremacy?**  
  No. Gods are not in columns and cannot be cursed. Only minions, buildings, and leaders in columns can be cursed.  

- **Do scarabs block activation?**  
  Yes. A cursed card has no text, so its "Action:" abilities cannot be used until uncursed.
