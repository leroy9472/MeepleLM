## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The game revolves around managing land, water, and resources in a rural landscape where terrain and river flow are critical. Players compete to establish dominance by building structures and controlling watered crops.  

**Objective**: Win by constructing a Hacienda plus 4 Casas, or 3 Casas if all buildings are on watered terrain.

2. Components  
- Hexagonal terrain tiles  
- Meeples (player pieces)  
- Dams (buildable structures)  
- Buildings: Casas and Hacienda  
- Water flow system (implied by terrain height)  
- Harvest tiles (4 face-up beside a draw pile)  
- Desperado cards (drawn and activated)  
- Currency ($500, $1000 values implied for buildings)

3. Setup  
- Each player starts with meeples and 2 dams (dams can also be gained later via forest harvest).  
- Place terrain hexes to form the board (exact layout not specified).  
- Place 4 harvest tiles face-up beside the draw pile.  
- Position river according to terrain elevation: water flows from high to low.  
- Players place meeples in starting positions (city likely default).

4. Gameplay Flow  
On each turn, a player performs the following two phases in order:  

**Phase 1: Move &/or Take Actions**  
- Spend up to 6 Movement Points (MP).  
- Movement:  
  - 1 MP per hex space.  
  - 2 MP to move directly from city to hacienda.  
  - Trails: 1 MP to enter trail, 1 MP to exit to connected area.  
  - May move through dams.  
- Meeple Limits:  
  - Any number of meeples allowed in city and on trails.  
  - Maximum of 2 meeples per hex.  
- Chasing Off:  
  - Only allowed after the victim has taken their first turn.  
  - Can chase from higher terrain:  
    - 1-to-1 or 2-to-2  
  - Can chase from any terrain:  
    - 2-to-1  
  - Chased meeple is sent to the city.  
  - Movement may continue after a successful chase.  
- Building:  
  - Must have a meeple in the space.  
  - Can build 1 or 2 buildings per turn, 1 per hex.  
  - Building types:  
    - **Casa** ($500): Prevents opponents from ending movement in that space; cannot enter if a meeple is present.  
    - **Hacienda** ($1000): Opponents cannot enter the space under any circumstances; immune to Desperado effects.  
- Dam Construction:  
  - Start with 2 dams; can gain more by harvesting forest (1 dam per forest harvest).  
  - Must have a meeple in the space to build.  
  - Can reroute river (or choose not to if on river).  
  - Cannot cut off *all* water flow options from the bottom edge of a hex (must preserve at least one outflow path).  

**Phase 2: Harvest or Delay**  
- Choose one:  
  - **Harvest**: Gain $100 for each controlled, watered crop. Gain 1 dam for each forest harvested.  
  - **Delay**: Take the end tile from the face-up row and place it closest to the draw stack (reshuffling order of upcoming harvests).  
- Desperados:  
  - Draw a Desperado card, activate its effect, then replace it.  
  - Effect: Attacks the first 3 occupied spaces it can reach; chases 1 meeple (sent to city).

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Water Flow**: Water flows from higher to lower terrain. A space is watered if it receives flow from upstream.  
- **Terrain Elevation**: Higher terrain enables chasing; critical for dam placement and water routing.  
- **Movement Economy**: 6 MP per turn allows flexible positioning, but trail and city/hacienda costs require planning.  
- **Building Control**: Casas and Hacienda restrict opponent access; Hacienda is fully defensive.  
- **Harvest Timing**: Delaying allows control over future harvest opportunities.  
- **Desperado Threat**: Periodic forced event that disrupts occupied spaces.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when a player meets one of the victory conditions:  
  - 1 Hacienda + 4 Casas, OR  
  - 1 Hacienda + 3 Casas *if all are on watered terrain*.  
- No endgame scoring beyond building count and placement condition.  
- Victory is immediate upon meeting criteria.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you build a dam and reroute water to flood your own buildings?**  
  Yes, but must follow outflow rule: cannot block *all* water exits from a hex bottom.  
- **Can you chase someone on your first turn?**  
  No—chasing is only allowed after the victim has taken their first turn.  
- **Can multiple buildings be placed in the same hex?**  
  No—only 1 building per hex.  
- **Does water flow through dams?**  
  Yes—movement through dams is allowed, and dams can be placed on river; water flow is reroutable.  
- **Are Desperado attacks optional?**  
  No—once drawn and activated, the Desperado must attack the first 3 occupied spaces and chase 1 meeple.
