## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Tongiaki is a strategic tile-laying and island expansion game inspired by Polynesian exploration. Players represent competing island clans navigating seas, expanding settlements, and establishing dominance through migration and colonization. The objective is to gain control of islands and establish Royal Islands to secure lasting influence.

### 2. Components  
- Boat pieces in player colors  
- Island tiles (featuring beaches and footbridges)  
- Sea tiles (with sea lanes and red symbols)  
- Starting island: Tonga  
- Player supply of boats  

*(Note: Exact component counts not specified in source.)*

### 3. Setup  
- Begin with the island of Tonga on the table.  
- Each player places two boats on any beaches of Tonga (per special rule: “NO BOATS ON THE BOARD”).  
- All other boats remain in player reserves.  
- Shuffle sea and island tiles into separate face-down stacks.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On their turn, a player must choose **one** of the following three actions:

#### 1. NORMAL TURN  
- **Expansion**: On any island where the player has at least one boat, they may place additional boats equal to the current number of their boats on that island.  
  - Restriction: No beach may receive more than one boat per turn.  
  - Example: If a player has 2 boats on an island, they may add 2 more (total 4), each on separate beaches.  

- **Migration**: If any beach the player occupies is full (i.e., has a boat on it and no empty adjacent beaches), they **must** initiate a migration.  
  - Draw a sea tile.  
  - Connect the **red symbol** on the drawn tile to the **footbridge** of the departing beach.  
  - Continue drawing and placing tiles in a chain, following valid connections (red to footbridge).  
  - The voyage continues until:  
    - An island tile is drawn and placed — this is **Landfall**.  
    - Or the voyage **fails**: when the number of **different-colored boats** in the migrating fleet is **less than the number shown on the sea lane** (presumably a value on the tile).  
  - If the voyage fails, the migrating boats are returned to their owners.  

- **Landfall**:  
  - When an island is reached via migration:  
    - Place **one boat on each beach** of the destination island (regardless of ownership).  
    - The player who initiated the migration places **the remaining boats** from the fleet anywhere they choose on that island (on empty beaches).  
    - Any boats beyond available beaches are **returned to their owners**.  

#### 2. FOUNDING ROYAL ISLAND  
- If a player is the **sole occupant** of an island (all boats on it are theirs), they may **found a Royal Island**.  
  - Place **one boat on its side** in the center of the island to mark it.  
  - Return **all other boats** on that island to their owner.  
- Restrictions:  
  - A player may control **at most two Royal Islands** at once.  
  - **No player may land on a Royal Island** — any attempting to do so are returned to their origin.  
  - **Expansion is not allowed** on Royal Islands.  

#### 3. NEW SETTLEMENT  
- A player may **remove all their boats from the board**.  
- Then, they draw tiles from the island/sea stack **until an island tile appears**.  
  - Sea tiles drawn before the island may be placed **anywhere legal** (connected via red symbol to footbridge, following placement rules).  
- When the island tile is drawn:  
  - Place it according to valid connection rules.  
  - The player places **one boat** on **any beach** of the newly placed island.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Tile Placement Rules**:  
  - Sea and island tiles must be placed so that the **red symbol** connects to a **footbridge** (and vice versa).  
  - Tiles cannot overlap or float disconnected.  
- **Boat Limits**:  
  - Only one boat per beach.  
  - Expansion is limited by current presence on an island.  
- **Voyage Resolution**:  
  - Migration is triggered by full beaches.  
  - Success requires reaching an island; failure occurs if fleet diversity < sea lane requirement.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Winning condition not specified** in the source.  
- Victory is likely tied to control of Royal Islands or total influence, but **no scoring rules are provided**.  
- Game end trigger(s) are not defined.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **NO BOATS ON THE BOARD**:  
  - Player may place:  
    - **One boat** on any island, **or**  
    - **Two boats** on Tonga.  
  - The player **may not Expand** this turn.  
  - However, if any beach they occupy becomes full (after placement), they **must carry out Migration**.  

- **ALL BOATS ON BOARD**:  
  - If a player has no boats in reserve, they may **take one boat from any island** (presumably one they occupy) to use in an Expansion action.  

- **Royal Island Interaction**:  
  - Cannot be expanded upon.  
  - Cannot be landed on — any migration or settlement attempt results in boats returning to origin.  

- **Tile Drawing for New Settlement**:  
  - Player draws until an **island tile** appears.  
  - Intermediate sea tiles are placed legally on the board and remain.
