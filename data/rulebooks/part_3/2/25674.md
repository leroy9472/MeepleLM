## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Khronos*, players are time-traveling adventurers using a time machine to influence three eras of the same region:  
- **The Age of Might** – Power lies with military strength.  
- **The Age of Faith** – Religious dominance yields wealth.  
- **The Age of Reason** – Urban populations control taxation.  

Players control two adventurers and use construction cards to build, upgrade, demolish, populate, and renovate buildings across the three time periods. The goal is to amass the most Ecus (currency) by collecting tax revenue at the end of turns 4 and 7. The player with the most Ecus after turn 7 wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the three boards in chronological order: Age of Might → Age of Faith → Age of Reason.  
2. Place the Turn Indicator on the first space of the turn tracker (on Age of Might board).  
3. Each player takes:  
   - 2 Adventurer Pawns and 25 matching Control Cubes  
   - 4 starting Ecus  
4. Place each player’s pawns on the designated starting spaces on the Age of Might board.  
5. Shuffle the Construction Card deck and deal 4 cards to each player.  
6. (Optional Rule) For Hold’em variant: Reveal 3 cards (1 of each color) next to the deck.  

Decide first player randomly. Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has four phases:  

#### I. Exchange Cards (Optional)  
- Discard any number of cards from hand.  
- Draw replacements to restore 4 cards.  
- Cost: 2 Ecus (paid only once per turn).  
- Cards may be exchanged partially or fully.  

#### II. Action Phase  
Two optional actions, in any order and repeated freely:  

**A. Travel in Time**  
- Spend 1 Ecu per movement of one Adventurer Pawn.  
- Move a pawn to any other time period (board).  
- A pawn must be on a board to act or score there.  

**B. Use Construction Cards**  
- Up to 4 cards may be played per turn.  
- Only 2 cards may be played per Adventurer Pawn.  
- Cards can be used on any board where a pawn is present.  
- Cards may be played before, after, or between movements.  

Available actions depend on the era:  

| Era | Actions |
|-----|--------|
| Age of Might & Faith | Construct, Upgrade, Demolish |
| Age of Reason | Populate, Renovate |

Unused cards are discarded at the end of the turn.

#### III. Draw Cards  
- Discard all remaining cards.  
- Draw up to 4 new cards.  
- If the deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.  

#### IV. Collect Earnings (Only on Turns 4 and 7)  
- After completing actions, the current player collects income.  
- Only collect from boards where the player has at least one Adventurer.  
- Scoring is detailed in **Scoring & End Game**.  

After the turn, pass play clockwise. When the first player’s turn ends, advance the Turn Indicator by one.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### A. Construction Rules  

**1. Rule of Hierarchy**  
- In each domain:  
  - The highest-value *Military* building must be unique.  
  - The highest-value *Religious* building must be unique.  
- Cannot build/upgrade to create a tie in the highest value.  
- Does not apply to Civil buildings.  

**2. Rule of Dominion**  
- Domains are groups of orthogonally connected buildings.  
- Only *Civil* buildings may be used to connect domains.  
- Cannot connect domains via Military or Religious construction.  

**3. Geographical Restrictions**  
- **Rivers**: Only Towns (2) and Cities (3) may be built on river squares.  
- **Forests**:  
  - 2–3 players: +1 card cost if construction covers any forest square.  
  - 4–5 players: No effect.  
- **Mountains**:  
  - 2–3 players: +2 card cost  
  - 4 players: +1 card cost  
  - 5 players: No effect  
- Mixed terrain:  
  - Plain + Forest → Forest  
  - Forest + Mountain → Mountain  
  - River squares are neutral (only subject to river rule)  

#### B. Rippling  
When a building is *constructed* or *upgraded* in an earlier era, it may ripple forward:  

| Building Size | Ripples To |
|---------------|-----------|
| Size 1 (Hamlet, Watchtower, Chapel) | No ripple |
| Size 2–3 Civil (Town, City) | Age of Faith + Age of Reason |
| Size 2–3 Military/Religious (Keep+, Monastery+) | Age of Faith only |
  - On Age of Reason: Appears as a *ruin* (no control cube)  

**Rippling Restrictions**:  
- Fails if it violates **Rule of Dominion** or **Rule of Hierarchy** on the target board.  
- Fails if no tile is available in stock.  

**Temporal Paradox**:  
- If a ripple from Age of Might would occupy space already filled on Age of Faith, the existing building is **destroyed** (removed).  

#### C. Domain Transformation  

**Connecting Domains**  
- Triggered by constructing/upgrading a Civil building that links two domains.  
- Apply **Rule of Hierarchy** to the new combined domain.  
- If violated:  
  - **Age of Might**: Compare total Military value. Lower side downsizes.  
  - **Age of Faith**: Compare total Religious value first, then Military.  
  - **Age of Reason**: No hierarchy → no conflict.  
- If tied:  
  - The player who caused the connection chooses which building downsizes (if not involved).  
  - If involved, their building downsizes first.  

**Downsizing**  
- Reduce a building to the next smaller size of the same type:  
  - Castle → Keep → Watchtower → (destroyed)  
  - Abbey → Monastery → Chapel → (destroyed)  
- Place the new building on any square previously occupied by the old one.  
- **Rippling Effects**:  
  - Downsizing a Keep/Monastery: Removes future time shadows.  
  - Downsizing a Castle/Abbey: Replaced by Keep/Monastery, which *does* ripple forward (as ruin in Age of Reason).  
- May cause domain separation.  

**Dividing Domains**  
- Occurs if a building is destroyed/downsized and breaks connectivity.  
- Each new domain must obey **Rule of Hierarchy**.  
- Violations resolved as above (priority: player who caused the split, then choice).  

#### D. Action Details  

**Constructing (Age of Might & Faith only)**  
- Use cards matching building color (e.g., orange for military).  
- Pay number of cards equal to building value.  
- Place on unoccupied space, obeying terrain and rules.  
- Place Control Cube on Military/Religious buildings.  
- **Bonus**:  
  - Age of Might: +1 Ecu  
  - Age of Faith: +2 Ecus  

**Upgrading (Age of Might & Faith only)**  
- Pay card difference between old and new building.  
- Must cover original space.  
- Retain Control Cube.  
- **Bonus**: Same as construction.  
- Cannot combine multiple small buildings into one.  

**Demolishing (Age of Might & Faith only)**  
- Only size 1 buildings: Hamlets, Watchtowers, Chapels.  
- Cannot demolish printed Hamlets or size 2+ buildings.  
- Cost: 1 Ecu + 1 card of same color.  
- May cause domain division.  

**Populating (Age of Reason only)**  
- Use Civil cards to place Control Cubes in Civil buildings.  
- Max cubes = building value (1/3/5).  
- Multiple players may coexist in one building.  
- Upgraded buildings retain cubes.  
- **Temporal Paradox Exception**:  
  - If a Town/City is destroyed, cubes are removed.  
  - If a printed Hamlet lies beneath, player with most cubes on original building keeps **1 cube** on the Hamlet.  
  - Tie: Current player removes cubes first, then chooses who keeps one.  

**Renovating (Age of Reason only)**  
- Use Military/Religious cards to restore ruins:  
  - Watchtower/Monastery: 1 card  
  - Castle/Abbey: 2 cards (can be paid over multiple turns)  
- Place a Control Cube on the ruin to mark progress.  
- Once fully paid, flip to building side. Remove marker cube.  
- Increases domain value for scoring.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Scoring occurs at the **end of each player’s turn** on **turns 4 and 7**.  
- Player collects from **boards where they have at least one Adventurer**.  
- Only **two** boards can be scored per player per scoring phase.  

| Era | Scoring Condition | Reward |
|-----|-------------------|--------|
| Age of Might | Control largest Military building in domain | Sum of all Civil building values in domain |
| Age of Faith | Control largest Religious building in domain | Sum of all Civil building values in domain |
| Age of Reason | Majority of Control Cubes in Civil buildings in domain | Sum of all Military and Religious building values in domain |
- **Tie in Age of Reason**: All tied players collect full amount.  

After turn 7, the last player collects revenue. The player with the most Ecus wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I score from a board I just left?**  
  No. You must have a pawn on the board **at the end of your turn** to score from it.  

- **Can I use 4 cards on one board?**  
  Yes, if both pawns are on the same board, each can play 2 cards.  

- **Can I demolish a printed Hamlet?**  
  No. Only constructed size-1 buildings may be demolished.  

- **What if I can’t ripple due to missing tiles?**  
  The building is built, but ripple stops where tiles run out.  

- **Can I renovate a ruin that was downsized?**  
  Yes. Once flipped back to ruin, it can be renovated again.  

- **Do Control Cubes on ruins count for anything?**  
  Only as progress markers during renovation. Not for ownership or scoring.  

- **Can I connect domains in Age of Reason?**  
  Yes, via Civil construction/upgrade, but **Rule of Hierarchy does not apply**.  

- **What happens if a ripple destroys a renovated building?**  
  The renovation is lost. The ruin reverts to unrenovated state.
