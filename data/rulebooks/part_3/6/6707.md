### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Age of Mythology*, players lead one of three ancient civilizations—Greek, Egyptian, or Norse—through four evolving ages: Archaic, Classical, Heroic, and Mythic. Drawing inspiration from the PC game by Ensemble Studios, players grow their civilizations by exploring terrain, gathering resources, recruiting armies, building cities, and harnessing divine powers. The ultimate goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) either by being the first to construct The Wonder or when the VP supply is exhausted.

Victory is achieved through military dominance, economic superiority, territorial expansion, or divine favor. The game ends immediately when a player builds The Wonder or the last VP cube is placed, after which final scoring determines the winner.

### 3. Setup
**Number of Players**: 2–6 (base supports 2–4; expansions allow up to 8).

**Assign Cultures**:

- For 4 players, one culture is excluded (team variant possible).

**Starting Player**:
- Roll two dice; highest roll wins. Re-roll ties.

**Player Setup**:
- Each player receives:
  - Matching Player Board, Permanent Action Deck, Random Action Deck, Battle Deck, and miniatures.
  - 4 Food, 4 Wood, 4 Gold, 4 Favor.
  - 2 of each Mortal unit (non-Villager) placed in Holding Area.

  - 30 Red VP cubes.

**Production Tiles**:
- Shuffle face-down pool.
- Starting player draws 6 tiles per player, reveals them.
- Players choose tiles in alternating order (clockwise, then counterclockwise) over 3 rounds until each has 6 tiles.
- Match terrain type when placing on board.
- Return unused tiles to pool.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn proceeds in the following phases:

1. **Victory Point Placement**:
   - Starting player places 1 VP cube on any of the 4 VP cards.
   - Next two players clockwise each place 1 VP cube (only 2 cubes in 2-player games).
   - If a player cannot place a cube (no empty spaces), the game ends.

2. **Action Card Draw**:
   - Players draw cards based on current Age:
     - Archaic: 4 cards
     - Classical: 5 cards
     - Heroic: 6 cards
     - Mythic: 7 cards
   - Select from Permanent Action Deck first (may look at all), then draw randomly from Random Action Deck (blind draw).

3. **Three Rounds of Action Card Play**:
   - Starting player begins each round.
   - Each player plays one card per round, performs its action.
   - Actions include: Explore, Gather, Recruit, Build, Trade, Attack, Next Age.
   - Permanent cards return to deck; Random cards go to bottom of deck (face up; reshuffle if needed).

4. **Resource Spoilage**:
   - Limit: 5 of each resource kept (Food, Wood, Gold, Favor).
   - Storehouse building increases limit to 8.
   - Excess returned to bank.

5. **Discard Unused Cards**:
   - Players may discard any remaining cards.
   - Kept cards count toward next turn’s hand limit.

6. **Rotate Starting Player**:
   - Pass to player on the left (except in 2-player games, where it does not rotate).

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Actions
- **Explore**: Draw number of tiles equal to players +1. Choose one; others may select in turn. Place on matching terrain.
- **Gather**: Choose to gather:
  - One terrain type (all players gather from that terrain), or
  - One resource type (all gather that resource), or
  - "Gather All" (Random card only): gather from all tiles.
  - Only the card player may reposition Villagers before gathering.
  - Gather order: card player first, then clockwise.
- **Recruit**: Spend resources to place units in Holding Area. Mortals and Myth units available at all times. Heroes only from current or earlier Ages.
- **Build**: Spend resources to place Building Tiles in City Area. Only one of each type (except Houses, max 10). Buildings provide ongoing effects.
- **Trade**: Exchange resources at 1:1 with bank. Cost printed on card (reduced to 0 with Market). Great Temple allows 8 Favor → 1 VP.
- **Attack**: Declare target (adjacent player only) and objective:
  - **City Area**: Destroy 1 Building (2 if Siege Engine Workshop or unit ability).
  - **Production Area**: Steal 1 Resource Tile (or destroy if no space).
  - **Holding Area**: Take 5 Resource Cubes (not VP).
  - Number on card = max units per side (e.g., Attack-4 = 4 units each).
  - Villagers cannot fight.
- **Next Age**: Pay resource cost to advance. Unlocks new Hero, higher hand size, and access to next-age units. Only one Age advancement per action.

#### Combat
- **Setup**:
  - Attacker selects target and area.
  - Both players secretly choose units (up to Attack card limit).
  - Reveal simultaneously.
- **Battle Rounds**:
  - Each round: both players select one unit to duel.
  - Reveal Battle Cards.
  - Roll dice:
    - Base dice from unit card.
    - +1 per level of unit (e.g., 2 dice for Mortal + Myth).
    - Bonus dice for:
      - Unit type advantages (e.g., +4 vs Flyers)
      - Wall/Tower: +2 dice for defender (if defending appropriate area)
      - Armory: +1 extra unit (not dice)
  - **Hit**: On 6s only. Most 6s wins. Tie → re-roll.
  - Winner eliminates opponent’s unit.
- **Special Rules**:
  - Heroes must fight Heroes if possible.
  - Higher-level units can kill multiple lower-level units.
  - Lower-level units need extra numbers to hit higher levels (e.g., 3 Mortals vs 1 Hero).
  - Retreat allowed before any round.
  - Survivor units return to Holding Area.
- **God Powers in Battle**:
  - May be used during player’s turn or when attacked.
  - Cost Favor (Archaic: 2, Classical: 3, Heroic: 4, Mythic: 5).
  - One-time use per power.

#### Supply & Housing
- Each House supports:
  - 1 Villager
  - 4 Military Units
- Cannot recruit beyond housing capacity.
- If Houses lost, units remain but no new units can be built until supply is sufficient.
- Villagers removed one per lost House.

#### Advancement by Age
| Age | Requirement | Hand Size | Unlockables |
|-----|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Archaic | Start | 4 | Archaic units |
| Classical | Build House | 5 | Classical Hero, more cards |
| Heroic | Build Siege Engine Workshop | 6 | Heroic Hero |
| Mythic | Build Great Temple | 7 | Mythic Hero, build The Wonder |

- Great Temple also allows 8 Favor → 1 VP during Trade.

#### God Powers (One-time Use)
- Randomly choose one God per Age.
- Cost increases by Age (2 to 5 Favor).
- Examples:
  - **Greek Zeus (Archaic)**: Kill one unit.
  - **Norse Thor (Archaic)**: Get gold tile of choice.
  - **Egyptian Osiris (Mythic)**: Gain Son of Osiris Hero.
  - **Greek Artemis (Mythic)**: Destroy 1D6 enemy buildings in one row.

2. **Largest Army**: Most non-Villager units at game end. Tie → no one scores.
3. **Most Buildings**: Most buildings in City Area at game end. Tie → no one scores.
4. **The Wonder**: Builder takes all cubes on the card.
5. **Great Temple**: Trade 8 Favor → 1 VP during Trade action.
