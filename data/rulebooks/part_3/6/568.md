## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
This document compiles rules for multiple card games playable with a Sticheln, Rage, or standard 52-card deck. Each game has unique mechanics and objectives, ranging from trick-taking and climbing games to area control and set collection. The core idea across all is strategic play using card combinations, suit management, and bidding.

### 2. Components  
The games use variations of the following components:
- **Card Decks**:  
  - *Sticheln/Rage-style decks*: Multi-suit decks with numbered cards (e.g., 0–18 in 5–6 suits: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet, Brown).  
  - *Standard deck*: 52 cards (2–A in ♠, ♥, ♦, ♣), sometimes including jokers.  
- **Tokens/Markers**: Chips, pawns, coins, boxes (e.g., Fool Marker, Shark Marker, Sellers, Vault, Showroom).  
- **Scoring Aids**: Crystals (diamonds), coins, score pads.  
- **Grids/Boards**: Used in games like Floriardo, Schotten-Totten.  

Specifics vary per game; all required components are listed under each game’s rules.

### 3. Setup  
General setup principles per game type:

#### Trick-Taking Games (e.g., Wizard, Sticheln, Hearts)
- Shuffle and deal all or a fixed number of cards evenly.
- Determine first dealer (randomly or rotating).
- Reveal trump suit if applicable (via flipped card or special rule).
- In partnership games, players sit opposite.

#### Climbing Games (e.g., Big Two, Fight the Landlord)
- Deal fixed number of cards (e.g., 13 or 17).
- Player holding lowest-ranked card (e.g., ♠3) leads first.

#### Set Collection / Area Control (e.g., Lost Cities, Parade)
- Shuffle and deal hand size (e.g., 8 cards).
- Set up discard piles, investment zones, or public areas.

#### Auction/Bidding Games (e.g., Raj, Wizard)
- Each player receives full hand.
- Chips or bid cards may be distributed.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Varies significantly by game category:

#### Trick-Taking Games
1. Player leads a card.
2. Others follow suit if able; otherwise, may play any card (or must trump, depending on game).
3. Trick is won by:
   - Highest trump (if any), else
   - Highest card of led suit.
4. Winner leads next trick.
5. Repeat until hands are empty.

**Special Rules**:
- Must follow suit unless specified.
- Trump may change per trick or be fixed.
- Some games allow “demands” (Twilight), “off-suit trumps” (Sticheln), or “multi-trick” play (Hatrick).

#### Climbing Games
1. First player plays a legal combo (single, pair, straight, etc.).
2. Next players must play a higher combo of same type and size, or pass.
3. When all pass, current player wins trick and leads next.
4. Goal: empty hand first (Big Two), or score based on leftover cards.

#### Set Collection / Grid Building (e.g., Lost Cities, Arboretum)
1. On turn: Play or discard a card, then draw.
2. Cards played must meet placement rules (e.g., ascending order, adjacency).
3. Game ends when deck is exhausted or hand size drops to zero.

#### Simultaneous Selection (e.g., Raj, Nicht die Bohne!)
- Players select cards or actions secretly.
- Reveal simultaneously.
- Resolve based on hierarchy (highest/lowest unmatched).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Trick-Taking Variants
| Game | Follow Suit? | Trump Rule | Special |
|------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| **Sticheln** | No | All unled suits are trump | O wins only if all played cards are O |
| **Wizard** | Yes, except for Wizard/Fool | Revealed card; Wizard lets dealer choose | Wizard always wins trick |
| **Hearts** | Yes | None | Cannot lead hearts until broken |
| **Twilight** | Partial | Two cults; players can demand others play | Demand mechanic; hand visibility |
| **Margin for Error** | Yes | No trump | Goal set secretly; partnerships |

#### Climbing Game Combos (e.g., Big Two, Fight the Landlord)
| Combo | Description | Ranking |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Single | One card | By rank, then suit |
| Pair | Two of same rank | By rank, then suit |
| Triple | Three of same rank | By rank |
| Straight | 5+ sequential ranks | By top card |
| Flush | 5+ same suit | By suit, then top card |

| Four-of-a-kind + kicker | Four same + one other | By quartet |
| Straight Flush | 5+ sequential, same suit | By top card |
| Bomb/Nuke | 4-of-a-kind or 2 jokers | Beats all non-bombs |

#### Scoring Systems
| Game | Scoring Basis | Points |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **Fête Fünfzehn** | Bid accuracy | ±3×bid + round # or penalty |
| **Nicht die Bohne!** | Bean cards (0), - cards (11–13), ×2 (14) | (Sum of 1–10) × multiplier |
| **Parade** | Suit majority | Low score wins; majority gets 1pt/card, others sum values |
| **Sticheln** | Misery suit vs. others | -value for misery suit, +1 per other card |
| **Fight the Landlord** | Bid × 2 × (Bombs + Nukes) | Winner takes payment from losers |

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Conditions
- **Fixed Hands**: Play N hands (e.g., Wizard: 10–20 hands; Sticheln: 1 per player).
- **Score Target**: First to X points (e.g., 400 in Chimera, 60 in Margin for Error).
- **Hand Exhaustion**: When deck or hands are empty (e.g., Lost Cities, Arboretum).
- **Elimination**: Last player with cards wins (Get Bit!).

#### Final Scoring Examples
- **Arboretum**: For each suit, only player with highest sum in hand scores. Then find longest orthogonal path of ascending values starting/ending in that suit. Score 1pt/card, doubled if 4+ and same suit.
- **Pepper**: For each '1' (Pepper), score 2 + number of cards in its suit.
- **Fiasco**: 1pt per '9', +40 for all six; 2pt per card in declared color, +6 for 7 cards.
- **Ohio**: (Sum of cards won) − (sum in hand) − 10 if Ohio card won or held.

#### Winning
- **High Score Wins**: Most games (Fête Fünfzehn, Raj, Nicht die Bohne!).
- **Low Score Wins**: Pepper, Scalation, Parade.
- **First to Empty Hand**: Big Two, Fight the Landlord.
- **Trick-Based Victory**: Schotten-Totten (3 adjacent or 5 total stones), Get Bit! (last alive).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: What happens if all players pass in a climbing game?**  
A: The last player to play a combo wins the trick and leads next.

**Q: Can you lead trump on the first trick in Hearts?**  
A: No, unless you have only hearts (or point cards: ♥ or Q♠).

**Q: In Wizard, what if a Fool is played?**  
A: It cannot win a trick. Trick is won by next highest trump or led suit.

**Q: In Sticheln, how do O (zero) cards win a trick?**  
A: Only if all cards played are O. Otherwise, they lose.

**Q: In Twilight, what happens if Purgatory wins the 7th trick?**  
A: The trick is set aside. The winner of the next trick takes both.

**Q: In Fight the Landlord, can you play a bomb after passing?**  
A: Yes. Passing does not remove you from the trick; you can still play a bomb later.

**Q: In Arboretum, can you move cards once placed?**  
A: No. Cards are fixed once played.

**Q: In Raj, what if highest/lowest cards are tied?**  
A: Leave chips in pool. Add next turn’s chip to the pool.
