## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

The Thirty Years War (1618–1648) was a complex conflict involving religious, political, and territorial struggles across Europe. The game simulates this war between the Catholic and Protestant factions, with gameplay spanning Early, Intermediate, and Total War phases.

**Objective**:  
- The Catholic player aims to **add** Victory Points (VPs).  
- The Protestant player aims to **subtract** VPs.  
- The game starts at **21 VPs**. Victory is determined at game end:  
  - **Protestant Victory**: 0–19 VPs  
  - **Draw**: 20 VPs  
  - **Catholic Victory**: 21+ VPs  
  *(Applies under Optional Rule 19.1)*

VPs are primarily gained or lost through geopolitical control, such as capturing key cities, fortresses, and regions.

### 5. Core Mechanics

**Activation**:
- Only **Dynamic Leaders** can activate stacks.
- Max 8 units per activation (sum of leader AR ratings).
- Leader moves with army; can activate multiple armies if MP allows (max 8 MP).
- Free moves allowed (per strategy guide).

**Movement & Stacking**:
- Stack limit: 8 units.
- Movement reduced by 1 if unpaid.
- Terrain and fortress modifiers affect combat and movement.
- **LoC Required** for payment unless locally paid (e.g., Bavarians near Munich).

**Recruitment**:
- Roll on Recruiting Table.
- **DRMs**:
  - +1 with Dynamic Leader
  - +2 with Wallenstein
  - -1 in Pillage -1 location
- Cannot recruit in Pillage -2.
- Units recruited must be paid immediately if possible.

**Combat**:
- **CRT** used; result based on strength ratio.
- **DRMs**:
  - Leader Battle Rating (only activated leader counts)
  - Combat Cards
  - Terrain, fortress, unit type
- **Leader Loss**: 20–30% chance per battle; higher if side loses.
- **Step Losses**: Taken evenly from full units.

**Siege**:
- Besieging army must end movement in fortress space.
- Roll on **Siege Table** during End Phase.
- **DRMs**:
  - -2 if besieging port
  - -? Fortress Siege Modifier
  - +1 if Spinola leads
  - +? Continued Siege marker
- Natural '9' = success; '0' = failure + step loss.

**Pillage**:
- Generated by:
  - Unpaid units looting
  - Movement through cities
  - Failed battles
- Effects: Hinders recruitment, movement, increases loot rolls.
- Recovery: 1d6/2 per turn, boardwide.

**Foreign Aid (AP)**:
- Used to pay units.
- Sources: England, Sweden (avg 6 AP every 3 turns), France (via Richelieu card: 7/3/8 AP).
- Units must trace LoC to supply base to be paid.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

**Q: Can Tilly command Imperial units?**  
A: Yes, under Optional Rule 19.7, until Wallenstein enters. Must separate by end of turn after entry or lose Imperial units.

**Q: What happens if a leader is alone and overrun?**  
A: Roll for loss with +3 DRM (per Real War Mod G.7).

**Q: Can units be paid during the Action Phase?**  
A: No, only during Pay Phase. But per House Rule 19.3, LoC status is checked at end of 6th round.

**Q: Can you stack Bavarian and Imperial units after retreat if forbidden?**  
A: Yes, temporarily (House Rule), but must separate in next round.

**Q: What happens to Repl leaders when eliminated?**  
A: Not permanently removed; return as reinforcements in End of Turn Phase (House Rule).

**Q: Do events on cards happen if used for activation?**  
A: Normally no, **unless** the card is on the "always happens" list (e.g., Peasant Revolt, Recovery cards). Then event occurs regardless of card use.

**Q: Can you recruit without paying?**  
A: Recruited units must be paid if possible. Unpaid units risk looting.
