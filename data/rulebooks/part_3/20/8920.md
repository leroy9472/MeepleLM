### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of multiple rounds. Each round proceeds as follows:

#### A. Start of Round  
1. **Leader rolls the die**:  
   - Result determines how many tiles each player draws.  
   - If "choice" is rolled, Leader chooses 2–5.  

2. **Tile Drawing**:  
   - Starting with the Leader and proceeding clockwise, each player draws the number of tiles shown.  
   - Newly drawn tiles must be kept **separate** from existing tiles.  
   - If the bag runs out before all players draw fully, remaining players receive fewer tiles. Unavailable tiles are **out of play**.  

#### B. Buying Tiles  
- Players inspect their drawn tiles.  
- Starting with the Leader and proceeding clockwise:  
  - Each player decides to **buy all** or **none** of their drawn tiles.  
  - **Price = (sum of pips on tiles)²**  
    - Example: E (1), E (1), J (4), D (2) → 1+1+4+2 = 8 → 8² = $64  
  - Payment is made to the **bank**.  
  - Unbought tiles are **placed in the box and out of play**.  
- Purchased tiles are added to a player’s personal tile stock.  

#### C. Selling Words  
- After all players have bought or discarded tiles:  
  - Players may form **one or more words** using **any tiles in their possession**, including Wild Tiles.  
  - **Only one Wild Tile** may be used per word.  
  - Acceptable words:  
    - Standard English words  
    - No capitalized, hyphenated, or foreign words  
  - **Word value = (sum of pips on tiles used)²**  
    - Example: ENJOYED = 13 pips → 13² = $169  
  - Player declares word, collects money from the bank, and places used tiles in the box.  

- **Challenges**:  
  - Any player may challenge a word.  
  - If the word is invalid, the **challenger wins**: the seller pays a **$20 penalty** to the bank.  
  - If the word is valid, the **challenger pays $20** to the bank.  

#### D. Ending the Round  
- **8-Tile Limit**:  
  - No player may hold more than **8 letter tiles** (Wild Tiles do not count).  
  - Excess tiles must be:  
    - Used in a word and sold, or  
    - Discarded to the box.  
- Once all players comply, the round ends.  
- The die is passed to the player on the Leader’s left, who becomes the new Leader.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Pip Value**: Each letter tile has a pip count (not specified per letter, but used in totals).  
- **Squaring Mechanic**: Both purchase cost and sale value are based on squaring the total pips.  
- **Tile Management**: Strategic accumulation and use of tiles under the 8-tile limit.  
- **Risk vs. Reward**: High-pip tiles cost more but can yield higher returns.  
- **Wild Tiles**: Flexible, but limited to one per word.  

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The **final round** occurs when the last letter tiles are drawn (likely fewer than required).  
- After purchase/discard phase:  
  - All players sell any possible words.  
  - Unused tiles are **lost** (returned to the box).  
- **Game ends** after final selling.  
- **Winner**: Player with the **most money**.  

**Solitaire Guidelines**:  
- $800 = fair  
- $900 = good  
- $1000 = outstanding
