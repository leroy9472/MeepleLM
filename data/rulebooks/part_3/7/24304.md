## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Unspeakable Words is a word-forming game set in a Lovecraftian universe where players are scholars delving into forbidden knowledge. The objective is to score points by forming words while managing your sanity, represented by Cthulhu pawns. The first player to reach exactly 113 points wins. Exceeding 113 causes a loss of sanity, and failing a final sanity check at 113 or above results in elimination.

2. Components  
- One deck of Alpha Playing Cards (each card has a letter and a numeric value)  
- Game tokens (5 per player) representing sanity (Cthulhu pawns)  
- One six-sided die (used with Cthulhu Dice rules)  
- Optional: Cthulhu Dice (custom dice with symbols: Yellow Sign, Tentacle, Elder Sign, Cthulhu, Eye)  
- Scorekeeping device  

3. Setup  
- Each player receives 5 sanity tokens (Cthulhu pawns)  
- Shuffle the Alpha Playing Cards and deal 5 cards to each player  
- Place the remaining deck in the center as a draw pile  
- Determine the starting player randomly  
- Set the target score to 113 points  

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, they:  
1. Play a word using cards from their hand  
2. Score the word by summing the numeric values on the cards  
3. Choose whether to attempt to keep all points or half (rounded up)  
4. Discard the used cards and draw back to 5 cards  
5. Make a sanity check by rolling a d20:  
   - Must roll ≤ the point value attempted (all or half)  
   - A roll of 20 always succeeds  
6. If the word is 7 letters long:  
   - Sanity check is made against half the word’s value (rounded up)  
   - Full point value is scored if the check succeeds  
7. Once any player reaches over 50 points:  
   - The active player may choose to roll the Cthulhu Dice once per turn  
   - The player currently in the lead may not roll the Cthulhu Dice  
   - No player may be targeted by the dice three times consecutively  
   - The active player chooses a target (other than themselves if they are leading)  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Word Formation: Players form valid words using cards from their hand. Each card has a letter and a numeric value.  
- Scoring: Sum the numbers on the cards used in the word.  
- Point Claim Choice: After forming a word, the player chooses to go for:  
  - Full points (must roll ≤ full value on d20)  
  - Half points, rounded up (must roll ≤ half value on d20)  
  - Player scores the amount they attempted, regardless of roll outcome, unless reaching 113+  
- Sanity Check:  
  - Required after every word played  
  - Roll d20; succeed if roll ≤ attempted points  
  - Roll of 20 always succeeds  
  - If the score from the word brings player to 113 or more:  
    - Failure means the player loses all points and sanity token  
    - Success means the player wins the game  
- 7-Letter Words:  
  - Score full points if successful  
  - Sanity check uses half the total (rounded up)  
- Cthulhu Dice (Optional):  
  - Usable only after any player exceeds 50 points  
  - Active player rolls one die and chooses a target (not the current leader)  
  - Effects:  
    - Yellow Sign: Target loses 1–6 points (determined by d6 roll)  
    - Tentacle: Target loses 1 sanity token (discards one Cthulhu pawn)  
    - Elder Sign:  
      - If caster has one of the two lowest sanity counts: gain 1 token  
      - Otherwise: lose 1 token  
    - Cthulhu: All players (except caster if it would eliminate them) lose 1 sanity token  
    - Eye: Caster chooses any of the above effects OR forces the target to redraw their entire hand (discard and draw 5 new cards)  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends immediately when a player reaches exactly 113 points and passes the final sanity check  
- A player who attempts to reach 113 or more and fails the sanity check:  
  - Loses all points  
  - Loses one sanity token  
  - If this causes loss of last token, they are eliminated  
- If a player runs out of sanity tokens, they are eliminated  
- Winner is the first to reach 113 and succeed on the final sanity check  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I use half points for a 7-letter word?  
  A: No — 7-letter words automatically use half the value for the sanity check, but full points are scored. You do not make a choice.  
- Q: What happens if I exceed 113?  
  A: You must make a sanity check. If you fail, you lose all points and one sanity token. If you succeed, you win.  
- Q: Can I roll Cthulhu Dice if I’m not the leader but someone else is over 50?  
  A: Yes, as long as at least one player has over 50 points, non-leading players may use the dice once per turn.  
- Q: Can the Eye effect force a redraw instead of a symbol effect?  
  A: Yes — the caster chooses either one of the symbol effects OR forces the target to redraw their hand.  
- Q: Can I target the same player twice in a row with Cthulhu Dice?  
  A: Yes, but not three times consecutively.
