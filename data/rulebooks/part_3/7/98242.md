### 5. Core Mechanics  

**Exploring:**  
- Flipping top card of Space Deck.  
- Only true "exploring" — completing Missions does **not** count.  
- *Sensor Scan* allows peeking at top card before deciding to keep or bottom it.  

**Battles:**  
- **Vs. Space Deck Starships (Standard):**  
  - **Diplomacy:** Flagship’s Speed & Diplomacy ≥ target → take as flagship or tap for VPs.  
  - **Combat:** Deal ≥ Defense in damage. Highest Speed attacks first.  
- **Vs. Borg Cube (Borg Invasion):**  
  - Cube gains +1 to all stats for each Borg Card revealed in players’ hands.  
  - Damage overflow must be assigned to another flagship after one is destroyed.  
  - Players decide damage assignment.  
  - Same Maneuver cannot be played twice by any player in one battle.  
  - Defeated Cube sets aside; each adds +1 to next Cube’s stats.  
- **Player vs. Player (War Events):**  
  - Turn player starts, clockwise, each plays 1 card or passes until all pass.  
  - Resolve combat by Speed (highest first). Ties: assign damage clockwise from turn player.  
  - **War Winner:** Undefeated flagship with highest: Attack → Speed → Diplomacy → proximity to turn player.  

**Borg Cards (Borg Invasion Only):**  
- Cannot be played or trashed during Trash Phase.  
- Only removed via card effects (returned to Borg Card Area).  
- **Assimilation:** Any player with 5+ Borg Cards in hand is removed from game.  
- **Loss Condition:** If Borg Card Area is empty, all players lose.  
- **Borg Cube Bonus:** Each revealed Borg Card in hand gives +1 to Cube’s stats.  

**Ally Starships (Klingon Civil War):**  
- Acquired if flagship meets:  
  - Speed **and** Attack ≥ target **OR**  
  - Attack **and** Diplomacy ≥ target  
- Not battled — if not acquired, moved to bottom of Space Deck at end of turn.  
- Provide bonus stats in battle while in Points Area.  

**Influence Cards (Klingon Civil War):**  
- Gain effect and stat bonus while in play.  
- Max 1 per player (except Romulan Influence).  

**Flagship Defeat:**  
- **Standard:** Gain 1 Ensign, reset damage, reshuffle deck, draw 5.  
- **Borg Invasion:** Gain 1 Borg Card instead of Ensign. Player cannot act until next turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

**Victory Conditions:**  
- **Borg Invasion:** Flip *Locutus* and meet its Goal.  
- **Klingon Civil War:** Flip *Arbiter* and meet Goal:

  - 200+ mission points.

- Missions, defeated Starships, Ally Starships, etc., all contribute.  

**Loss Conditions (Borg Invasion):**  
- Any player has 5+ Borg Cards in hand → assimilated → team loses.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

- **"Exploring player" in Borg rules:** Refers to **all players** — cooperative play.  
- **Locutus Conditions:** Set immediately after flip. No cards may be played before, but can be played after to meet conditions.  
- **Sensor Scan:** Can be used multiple times per turn. Each use allows peeking before flipping.  
- **Borg Cube Stats:** Set when flipped, remain for entire battle.  
- **Multiple Explores:** If 3 cards are face-up in Mission Area, choose 1 to send to bottom.  
- **Card Effects During Resolution:** Must finish one effect before starting another.  
- **XP for Missions:** Need 6+ XP *in Bridge*, not to spend 6 XP.  
- **Upgrading Flagship:** Diplomacy only. Old flagship goes to Points Area. Damage does not carry over.  
- **Defeated Non-Battling Player:** A player whose ship was destroyed before a battle (e.g., by prior Cube) does **not** participate and gets no Borg Card.  
- **Damage Overflow:** Excess damage after destroying a flagship must be assigned to another.
