### 3. Setup
- Board is set up as per the illustrated setup diagram.
- Each player starts with:
  - **5 gold**
  - **5 wood**
- Each player begins with standard starting units (implied by "normal 2-player game", confirmed in similar scenarios: 3 melee units and 3 workers in town space).
- Gold Mines and Forests adjacent to town spaces do **not deplete**.
- If a player rolls a **3** when harvesting from these adjacent spaces, **ignore depletion**.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game follows the standard **2-player Warcraft** turn sequence:
1. **Move**
2. **Harvest**
3. **Battle (if applicable)**
4. **Deploy**
5. **Spend**

**Special Rules During Harvest**:
- Gold Mines and Forests adjacent to town spaces are **immune to depletion**.
- Rolling a **3** during harvest in these spaces **does not trigger depletion**.

All other gameplay follows standard Warcraft rules.

---

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Harvesting**: Workers roll the resource die. On a roll of 3, partial depletion is normally placed; **this is ignored** for town-adjacent resources.
- **Depletion Immunity**: Only applies to forests and mines **adjacent to town spaces**.
- **Resource Management**: Critical due to limited initial resources (5 gold, 5 wood).
- **Victory Point Accumulation**: VP likely gained through unit kills, outpost control, or card effects (standard mechanics).
- **Combat**: Standard battle rules apply (ranged → flying → melee; flanking; experience cards).

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Victory Conditions** (either condition ends the game immediately):
- A player accumulates **12 Victory Points**.
- A player **eliminates the opposing player** (destroys all units, workers, and town).

Game ends as soon as either condition is met.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Q**: Does the "ignore depletion on roll of 3" apply to all spaces?  
  **A**: No. Only **Gold Mines and Forests adjacent to town spaces** are protected.

- **Q**: Can depletion markers be removed from non-adjacent spaces?  
  **A**: No special rule allows this. Standard rules apply: once fully depleted, spaces are unusable.

- **Q**: Are outposts allowed?  
  **A**: Yes. The scenario follows standard rules, so outpost construction is permitted unless contradicted (it is not).

- **Q**: What counts as eliminating the opponent?  
  **A**: Destruction of all units, workers, and the **town space** (per standard Warcraft rules).

- **Q**: Are experience cards used?  
  **A**: Yes. The scenario states it is played as a "normal 2-player game", which includes experience decks.
