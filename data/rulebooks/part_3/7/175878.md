## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the world of 504, players assume the roles of traveling traders or tribal leaders striving for prosperity through strategic movement, trade, and expansion. In the specific world 123 (Pickup & Deliver with Production), traders deliver goods to cities to earn prestige and victory points (VP). The goal is to deliver the most goods and complete sets of all five types of goods to maximize VP. The player with the most VP at game end wins. Ties are broken first by goods remaining in cargo holds, then by income in the final round.

2. Components  
- 48 Goods tokens (5 types)  
- 30 Covering tokens  
- 10 Transport trolleys (1 per player)  
- 15 Cargo hold cards (upgrades)  
- 12 Movement tokens (MP markers)  
- 1 Overview tile  
- 10 City cards (numbered 1–10)  
- 20 Settlements per player (2–4 players)  
- 9 Residents per player (in games with residents)

Note: Component counts may vary based on modules used.

3. Setup  
- Place city cards in ascending numerical order (city 1 on top, city 10 on bottom).  
- Place 4 goods on each city, matching the symbol on the city card.  
- Each player selects a capital city and places their headquarters (settlement) on it.  
- Place player’s transport trolley on their capital.  
- Load 1 good from the capital into the trolley’s cargo hold.  
- Each trolley starts with 1 cargo hold and 3 movement points (MP).  
- (If using Module 2) Place 1 resident from each player on their capital city card.  
- (If using Module 3) Prepare privilege deck:  
  - Shuffle privileges by back (I, II, III), stack III on bottom, II in middle, I on top.  
  - Reveal 1 privilege per player (3 if 2 players) at $20 each.  
  - Place price token next to row.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of player turns in clockwise order. On a turn, a player performs the following phases:  
1. **Player Order (if applicable)** – Determine turn order (varies by module).  
2. **Privileges (Phase 3C)** – If fewer privileges are face-up than players, draw one at $20.  
   - Buy one privilege for $20.  
   - If no one buys, price drops to $0. If all pass at $0, remove the privilege.  
   - Price resets to $20 for newly drawn cards.  
3. **Capital (Phase 3A, if applicable)** – Optionally change capital by swapping headquarters with a settlement.  
4. **Residents (Phase 3D/3G)** – Move residents, settle new tiles, trigger income.  
5. **Transport Trolley (Phase 3E)** – Move trolley, load/unload goods/residents.  
   - Spend 1 MP per tile, 2 MP to enter mountain.  
   - On own roads: 0.5 MP per tile.  
   - Can load/unload any number of times.  
   - Must deliver goods to cities with matching demand.  
   - Each city accepts only one good per type.  
6. **Upgrades (Phase 3F)** – Buy one upgrade:  
   - Increase cargo hold (costs escalating: 1→2: $30, 2→3: $50, etc.)  
   - Add 1 MP (costs: 3→4: $20, 4→5: $30, 5→7: $40)  
7. **Income (Phase 3H)** – Collect income:  
   - $20 base for capital.  
   - $5 for first settlement on field/forest/water, $10 for mountain/city.  
   - Bonus for placing residents on city cards: $10 (1st), $20 (2nd), $30 (3rd), etc.  
   - Income from delivering goods to trading houses (Module 8).  

5. Core Mechanics

  - +1 MP per opponent when entering opposing territory for the first time.  
- **Loading/Unloading**:  
  - Each cargo hold carries 1 good or up to 2 exhausted residents.  
  - Unload on city with matching demand to score.  
  - Goods left on non-demanding tiles remain until picked up.  
- **Residents & Settlements**:  
  - First entry to a tile: resident becomes settlement.  
  - Unloading residents on opposing tile triggers fight.  
  - Cannot load residents on opposing tiles.
