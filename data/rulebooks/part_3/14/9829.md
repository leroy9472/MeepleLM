- **Skill Tests**:

  - Head = Mind, Hand = Body, Circle = Spirit.  
  - Roll d20 + attribute + bonuses. ≥ target = success.  
  - Spend 1 Exhaustion to gain +2 to a skill test.

  - **Rune Plate**: Once during Before Combat and once per combat round, cancel 1 Wound.  
  - **Shield of Light**: Activate to cancel 1–2 Wounds and inflict 1 Wound on enemy.  
  - **Staff of Light**: Before moving, activate to discard all Wounds and Exhaustion from Hero or one Ally.  
  - **Touch of Death**: Before Combat, activate and take X Exhaustion to make magic attack; if successful, inflict X Wounds.  
  - **Wings of Regiroth**: Before moving, activate to move up to 4 spaces instead of rolling.
