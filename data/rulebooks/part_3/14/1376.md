## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Don is a strategic bidding and economic game where players compete to acquire district cards through auctions. The goal is to maximize points by collecting sets of cards of the same color and accumulating wealth. Victory is determined by combining set-based scoring with chip bonuses and tiebreakers.

### 2. Components  
- A deck of district cards (15 cards total, revealed over 15 rounds)  
- Chips (currency): 10 or 12 per player (sources vary slightly)  
- Optional: a central pot for remainder chips (if used)

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose a starting player.  
2. Shuffle the deck of district cards and place it face-down.  
3. Give each player:  
   - 10 or 12 chips (depending on reference: 12 in Don Quick Reference, 10 in QuickSetupGuide_SerengetiV1.1)  
   - Keep chips hidden.  
4. The game proceeds over 15 rounds.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this sequence:

#### Step 1: Reveal District Cards  
- Reveal 1, 2, or 3 district cards per round in repeating pattern:  
  Round 1: 1 card  
  Round 2: 2 cards  
  Round 3: 3 cards  
  Round 4: 1 card  
  … and so on (1-2-3 cycle repeated over 15 rounds).

#### Step 2: Auction the Lot  
- The starting player makes the first bid (any amount they can pay).  
- Bidding proceeds clockwise. Each player must either:
  - Raise the bid (higher than current), or  
  - Drop out of the auction.  
- Bidding continues until only one player remains.  
- The last remaining player wins the lot.

#### Bidding Restrictions  
- A player **cannot** bid a number whose **last digit** matches the number on any district card they already own.  
  - Example: If you own a district #4, you cannot bid 4, 14, 24, etc.  
- If a player makes an illegal bid (even if retracted):  
  - Pays 1 chip penalty to the bank.  
  - Is immediately disqualified from the current auction (drops out).  

#### Special Auction Outcomes  
- **No bids are made**:  
  - The starting player receives the lot for free (no payment).  
- **Winning bidder cannot pay the bid amount**:  
  - The player must discard one of their previously won district cards (removed from the game).  
  - The auction is restarted for the same lot.  
  - The offending player **cannot participate** in the restarted auction.

#### Step 3: Payment & Distribution  
After the winning bid is paid, the money is distributed as follows:

- The **winner never receives any money** from their own bid.  
- Distribution is based on the **last digit** of the winning bid (e.g., bid = 17 → use 7).  
- Identify all players who own district cards matching that digit.

**Distribution Rules:**  
1. If **one player owns more matching cards** than any other → that player receives **all** the chips.  
2. If **two or more players tie** for most matching cards → split the bid **equally** among them.  
3. If **no one owns a matching card** → split the bid **equally among all other players** (excluding the winner).  
4. **Remainders**:  
   - If chips cannot be split evenly, distribute as many as possible (round down).  
   - Any leftover chips go into a **central pot**.  
   - This pot is added to the distribution in the **next auction’s payment**.

#### Step 4: Next Round Setup  
- The **winning bidder becomes the starting player** for the next round.  
- Proceed to the next round (next card(s) revealed in 1-2-3 cycle).

#### Optional Variant: Exchange Phase  
- Trigger: At the start of a round, if **two or more players own at least one district**, an Exchange Phase occurs.  
- Starting with the start player, each player may:  
  - Take one district card from another player.  
  - Give one of their own district cards to that player in exchange.  
- **Restriction**: Players who participate in the exchange **may not bid** in the upcoming auction.  
- If **all players participate**, then no one may bid → start player takes the lot for free.

#### Side Auction (Financial Difficulty)  
- A player in financial trouble may **sell one of their district cards** in a side auction.  
- Rules for this auction are not fully specified, but it occurs outside the main turn structure.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Bidding with Restrictions**: Last digit of bid must not match any number on your owned cards.  
- **Dynamic Money Flow**: Winners pay, but others collect based on digit matching.  
- **Chip Management**: Crucial for staying competitive in later, higher bids.  
- **Set Collection**: Points are scored for collecting multiple cards of the same color.  
- **Turn Order Control**: Winning an auction grants start player status next round.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after **15 rounds** (all cards auctioned).

#### Final Scoring:  
1. **Color Sets**: Score points for each color based on number of cards:  
   - 1 card = 1 point  
   - 2 cards = 3 points  
   - 3 cards = 6 points  
   - 4 cards = 10 points  
   - 5 cards = 15 points  
   (Formula: n(n+1)/2)

2. **Chip Bonus**:  
   - The player with the **most chips** gains **2 points** (per Don Quick Reference)  
   - *Note: QuickSetupGuide_SerengetiV1.1 says 3 points; discrepancy exists*  
   - In case of a tie for most chips, **all tied players** receive the bonus (per Serengeti guide).

3. **Final Score**: Sum of set points and chip bonus.

#### Tiebreaker:  
If players are tied in total points:  
1. Compare **sum of numbers** on their district cards.  
   - Higher sum wins.  
   - (Note: QuickSetupGuide_SerengetiV1.1 lists tiebreakers as: most cards → most chips, conflicting with above)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I bid zero?**  
  Not explicitly forbidden, but zero may match a card #0 if owned → illegal if you own #0.  
- **What if I have no cards?**  
  You can bid any amount (no number to conflict with).  
- **Do cards in the current lot count for bidding restrictions?**  
  No — only cards **already owned** matter.  
- **Can I drop out after making an illegal bid?**  
  Yes — you pay 1 chip penalty and drop out immediately.  
- **What happens to the pot if no distribution occurs next round?**  
  It remains until the next distribution opportunity.  
- **Can I exchange my only card?**  
  Yes, as long as you give one and take one. You cannot give away your last card without receiving one.  
- **Do matching cards include those just won?**  
  Yes — once placed in front of you, they count for future bid matching.
