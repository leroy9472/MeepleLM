### 1. Lore & Objective
In the year 2220, an alien parasite has infiltrated a mining station on Recon-6, turning infected team members into killing machines. Players control a Trooper and an Android, sent to locate and destroy the parasite hive. The mission: burn the Hive using 3 gas can cards. One player is secretly the Host, infected from the start, and must infect or eliminate others to prevent the hive’s destruction. The game ends when either the humans destroy the Hive or the infected achieve victory.

Victory Conditions:
- **Human Victory**: An uninfected Trooper plays 3 gas can cards in the Hive (costs 1 AP).
- **Infected Victory**: Achieved if:
  - All surviving players are infected (confirmed by a Heat Scan), though the last infected player does not win.
  - Only one human remains and no gas cans are available in hand or the Search Deck.
  - All Troopers are eliminated (only Troopers can destroy the Hive).
- Note: The game continues even if the Host is killed. Only living players win.

### 2. Components
- **46 Search Cards**: Include items (e.g., Gas Cans, Ammo, Armor), the Host card, and Parasite Alert cards.
- **20 Exploration Cards**: Form the station layout, including Reactor (starting room), Hive, Computer Terminal, Sick Bay, Run, Storage, Team Search, and Parasite Alert rooms.
- **12 Character Cards**: 2 per player (Trooper and Android), tracking health and Action Points (AP).
- **12 Wooden Character Discs**: 2 per player (Trooper and Android), marked with color stickers.
- **10 Wooden Parasite Discs**: 5 black (2 health, 2 damage), 5 gray (1 health, 1 damage). Black parasites are double-sided (black = full health, gray = wounded).
- **12 Check Cards**: 6 red (infected), 6 blue (not infected), used in Heat Scans.
- **1 Heat-Check Board**: Tracks identity during Heat Scans.
- **1 d4 Die**: Determines parasite movement and spawning direction.
- **Stickers**: Apply color stickers to character discs; gray parasite stickers go on one side of black parasite discs.

### 3. Setup
1. **Player Setup**: Each player chooses a color and takes:
   - 2 Character Discs (Trooper and Android)
   - 2 Character Cards (place face-up, 4 hearts up)
   - 3 Infection Cards (of their color)
   - 2 Check Cards (1 red, 1 blue)

2. **Search Deck Setup**:
   - Set aside 1 Host card and 1 Gas Can per player.
   - Draw (2 × number of players) - 1 random cards from the Search Deck.
   - Combine these with the Host and Gas Can cards, shuffle, and place on top of the Search Deck (this stack = 3 × number of players cards).
   - Each player draws 2 cards from this stack. If a Parasite Alert is drawn, resolve it (place gray parasite in Reactor), discard, and draw a replacement.
   - All players should have 5 cards (3 Infection + 2 Search).

3. **Exploration Deck Setup**:
   - Remove Hive and Open Terminal cards.
   - Split remaining 18 cards into two piles.
   - Shuffle Open Terminal into one pile; shuffle Hive into bottom 3 cards of that pile.
   - Place other pile on top. All cards start black-side up (unsearched).

4. **Board Setup**:
   - Place Reactor room in the center.
   - Randomly choose starting player; give them the Parasite Marker (passed clockwise after each Parasite Phase).

5. **Starting Positions**: On their first turn, each player places both characters in the Reactor.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of:
1. **Parasite Phase** (before Team Phase)
2. **Team Phase** (all players take turns)

**Parasite Phase**:
- Player with Parasite Marker rolls d4; all parasites move 1 room in that direction (per Reactor template), unless blocked by wall, closed door, or unexplored area.
- Doors opened by Computer Terminal close before movement.
- After movement, each parasite attacks all characters in its room:
  - Gray parasite: 1 damage
  - Black parasite: 2 damage
- Pass Parasite Marker clockwise.
- Occurs every (N + 1) turns (e.g., 4-player game: turns 1, 6, 11...).

**Team Phase**:
- Starting with player who just passed the Parasite Marker, players take turns clockwise.
- Each player spends combined AP from both characters (max 4 at full health).
- Actions cost 1 AP each; may be performed multiple times per turn.
- Actions:
  1. **Explore**: Add top Exploration card adjacent to current location (black side up). Must connect legally (no door to wall). May place through closed security door. If unplayable, discard to bottom and try next card (once per turn).
  2. **Move**: Spend 1 AP to move character to adjacent room. Requires keycard or open door for security doors. Moving into a room with another player triggers trade or attack.
  3. **Fire Gun**: Androids only. Costs 1 AP + 1 bullet. Standard: 1 shot, same room. With Target Scope: adjacent room. Heavy Gun: 2 shots for 1 AP. Kills gray parasite; black parasite becomes gray (or flip if no gray available).
  4. **Search Location**: Spend 1 AP to draw top Search card. Flip room to red side. If red room, roll d4 and spawn parasite before drawing. If Parasite Alert card drawn, resolve immediately (spawn parasite), discard, no replacement.
  5. **Activate Computer Terminal**: 1 of 3 functions (costs 1 AP):
     - **Heat Scan**: Poll infection status (see below).
     - **Open All Security Doors**: Doors stay open until next Parasite Phase.
     - **Reveal Location**: Add a room anywhere on the board.
  6. **Heal in Sick Bay**: Spend 1 AP to heal 2 HP (1 each if both characters present). Flip room if black; if red, spawn parasite first.
  7. **Use Item**: Play item card (costs 1 AP if marked). Must have ≥6 cards to play (keeps hand at ≥5). Single-use items discarded after use.

**Order of Actions When Entering Room**:
1. Decide to attack (costs 1 AP) — if yes, no trade.
2. If no attack, must trade (0 AP).
3. After trade, may still attack (costs 1 AP).
4. Then perform other actions.

**Trading Rules**:
- Mandatory when entering room with other player (except Reactor).
- Each player picks a card and passes face-down.
- Infected may pass own-color Infection Card to infect.
- Uninfected dodges infection by passing Gas Can.
- Cannot pass own Infection Card unless infected.
- If out of items, may pass another player’s Infection Card (no effect).
- Each character can trade once per room per turn.

**Heat Scan**:
- Perform via Computer Terminal (1 AP).
- Each player places true status Check Card (red=infected, blue=not) on green (+) side of Heat-Check Board; other card on red (-) side.
- Shuffle each pile separately, reveal green pile.
- Players learn how many are infected, not who.
- Return Check Cards to players.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Action Points (AP)**: Based on health. 3–4 hearts = 2 AP; 1–2 hearts = 1 AP. Combined AP used freely.
- **Hand Size**: Must maintain at least 5 cards. Cannot play item if it reduces hand below 5. Exception: burning Hive.
- **Infection**:
  - Host starts infected. Can infect via trade (own-color Infection Card).
  - If both characters of a player are infected, they are both infected regardless of location.
  - Infection dodged with Gas Can (card is traded, not used up).
- **Parasite Mechanics**:
  - Placed during Parasite Phase (movement + attack).
  - Spawned via Parasite Alert (card, room, or red-room search): roll d4, place in adjacent room (or same room if no adjacent).
  - Gray parasite: 1 damage, dies when hit.
  - Black parasite: 2 damage, becomes gray when hit (flip or replace).
- **Items**:
  - **Armor**: Out-of-turn reaction. Prevents 1 damage (knife, gun, parasite). Protects both characters if in same room.
  - **Grenade**: 1 AP, damage to all in adjacent room. Counts as attack for trade avoidance.
  - **Energy Boost**: +2 AP this turn. Multiple usable.
  - **Body Scanner**: 1 AP, force another player to reveal hand.
  - **Keycard**: Use to pass security doors. Cannot open for others.
  - **Target Scope**: Android only. Shoot into adjacent room.
  - **Heavy Gun**: Android only. 2 shots for 1 AP.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends when victory condition is met after any player’s turn.
- **Human Win**: Uninfected Trooper in Hive plays 3 Gas Cans (1 AP). Breaks hand limit rule.
- **Infected Win** if:
  - All living players infected (Heat Scan proof).
  - One human left, no 3 Gas Cans available.
  - All Troopers eliminated.
- **Last Player Infected Loses**: Except if Host wins alone or last infected is dead.
- **Eliminated Players**: Both characters dead = out of game. Cards removed. Cannot win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Parasite in Setup**: If Parasite Alert drawn during setup, place parasite in Reactor. No damage until next Parasite Phase (players not yet on board).
- **Team Search**: Trooper and Android of same color can perform Team Search. Active player spends 1 AP, both draw 1 card (randomly distributed).
- **Keycard Use**: Only for personal use. Cannot open doors for others.
- **Free Movement in Run Room**: Must be empty (only own other character allowed). Cannot search and use free move.
- **Item Reuse**: Once played, items stay on table (unless single-use). Cannot be picked up.
- **Host Card Passing**: Normally stays with Host. Variant allows passing after 3 failed infections.
- **Hive Placement**: If unplaceable, try next card. If still unplaceable and it’s last card, infected win.
- **Computer Terminal Use**: Only flips room if black. If red, spawns parasite.
- **Gas Can Limit**: Can break 5-card rule only when burning Hive.
