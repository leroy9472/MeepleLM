## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Noah is racing against time to finish building the Ark and load animals before the flood arrives. Players help Noah by strategically placing animals and supplies onto the Ark, respecting each animal’s needs and maintaining balance. The goal is to score the most points by having the majority of animal tokens on the five animal type score cards, while managing Ark stability and endgame conditions.

The game ends when the fifth Rain card is drawn. Players score points based on animal majorities and remaining action discs. The player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the player with fewer animal cards in hand wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Place the Bow card** in the center with space on both sides. Place the **5 Score cards** to one side.  
2. **Choose first player**.  
3. **Distribute Action discs**:  
   - 3 players: each gets 3 discs  
   - 4th and 5th players: each gets 4 discs  
   - Remaining discs form the reserve.  
4. **Each player takes their colored Animal tokens**.  
5. **Prepare starting Ark layout**:  
   - Remove Rain cards from the deck.  
   - Shuffle remaining cards.  
   - Draw 4 cards; place one in each of the 4 initial Ark cabins.  
     - Only cards with **weight 1 or 2** are used.  
     - No more than **two of the same animal type** allowed.  
     - Discard (face down under deck) any invalid cards.  
6. **Set Ark inclination**:  
   - Calculate total weight on each side of the Ark (port vs. starboard).  
   - Place the **yellow disc** on the Bow card to show the difference in weight (e.g., +2 on one side).  
7. **Shuffle Rain cards back in**:  
   - Shuffle the remaining deck (including discarded cards, but no Rain cards yet).  
   - Split deck into two roughly equal piles.  
   - Shuffle **4 Rain cards** into the second pile.  
   - Place the **5th Rain card on top** of that pile.  
   - Place the first pile on top.  
   - This ensures the first Rain card appears around the middle of the game.  
8. **Deal starting hands**:  
   - Each player draws **2 cards** (kept secret).  
   - Reveal **3 face-up cards** next to the draw pile.

#### A. Take Cards  
- Take **one face-up card** and **one card from the top of the draw pile**.  
- Then, draw a new card from the deck to refill the face-up display to 3 cards.  
- **If a Rain card is drawn**:  
  - Place it face up.  
  - Draw another card until a non-Rain card is drawn.

  - Heat-loving (yellow) and cold-loving (blue) animals **cannot share** a cabin.  
  - Climate-indifferent (yellow-blue) animals **can** share with either.  
- **Weight balance**:

  - When a card is played, move the **yellow disc** on the Bow card by the card’s weight toward the side it’s placed.

- After opening a cabin, the player **immediately takes one face-up card** from the display.  
- If opening a second cabin in the same turn, takes from remaining face-up cards.  
- At end of turn, refill display to 3 cards.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Special Card Abilities  
- **Fox**: When played, take **2 Action discs** from the reserve.  
- **Turtle / Hedgehog / Porcupine**: Can share cabin with **larger carnivores/omnivores**; allows second carnivore/omnivore in cabin.

- **Mosquito**: Ejects an animal of **weight 2**.  
- **Spider**: Ejects a **fearful (shy)** animal.  
- **Brontosaurus**: Place your Animal token on an **orange disc** (counts as **1.5 tokens** for scoring). Two such discs = 3 Animal tokens.  
- **Chimpanzee**: Place an orange disc under your Animal token on **any Score card** (except Supplies); counts as **1.5 tokens**.  
- **Woodworm**: Place **between two cabins**, creating a **double cabin** (follows all placement rules). After placing, may play a **second card**, even if Slow or Supply.

#### Ejecting Animals  
- When an animal is ejected:  
  - The **ejecting animal takes its place**.  
  - The **ejected animal is removed from the game**.  
  - The ejecting player places **one of their Animal tokens** on the **score card** of the **ejected animal**.  
  - The original token on the score card **remains**.  
  - Adjust **Ark tilt** by the **weight difference** between the two animals.  
- **Fox, Mosquito, and Spider cannot be ejected**.  
- If a **Brontosaurus or Chimpanzee** is ejected, the ejecting player **gains their special scoring benefit** (1.5 tokens).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Trigger: Fifth Rain Card Drawn  
- The player who draws it **ends their turn immediately** (no draw).  
- Other players begin the **End Game phase**.

#### End Game Phase  
- Players take turns clockwise.  
- On a turn, choose:  
  - **Play**: Pay **1 Action disc** to play **1 Animal card** (cannot play Slow animals or Supplies).  
    - May open new cabin (costs 1 disc to neighbor + 1 to play card).  
  - **Pass**: Exit the game. No further turns.  
- **No card draws** during this phase.  
- Game ends when **all players have passed**.

#### Final Scoring  
1. **Reveal Pets**:  
   - Each player reveals their **Pet card** (chosen when 2nd Rain card was drawn).  
   - **Invalid pets** (Provisions, weight 3+, has special ability) are **discarded and not scored**.  
   - For valid pets, place **one Animal token** on the corresponding Score card.  
2. **Score each of the 5 Score cards**:  
   - **1st place (most tokens)**: 10 points  
   - **2nd place**: 6 points  
   - **Other players with at least one token**: 2 points  
   - **Ties**:  
     - Add points together and **divide equally**, **rounding up**.  
     - Example:  
       - 2-way tie for 1st: (10+6)/2 = **8 points each**  
       - 2-way tie for 2nd: (6+2)/2 = **4 points each**  
       - 3-way tie for 1st: (10+6+2)/3 = **6 points each**  
3. **Action discs**: Each remaining disc = **1 point**.  

#### Winning  
- Highest total score wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with **fewest Animal cards in hand** wins. (Provision cards do not count.)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a Supply card during End Game?**  
  No. Only Animal cards may be played, and only by paying 1 Action disc.  
- **Can I open a cabin without an Action disc?**  
  No. You must give 1 disc to your neighbor. If you have none, you cannot open a cabin.  
- **Can a carnivore be the same weight as another animal?**  
  No. Carnivores must be **lighter**; same weight is not allowed.  
- **Can I eject an animal to make room for a larger one?**  
  Yes, if the ejecting animal meets all placement rules after ejection.  
- **Does ejection count as playing a card?**  
  Yes. Playing a Skunk to eject an animal uses your card play for the turn.  
- **Can I use a Woodworm to play a Slow animal or Supply?**  
  Yes, **only** when playing it **after** the Woodworm in the same turn.  
- **Can I take a face-up card when opening a cabin during End Game?**  
  No. During End Game, no cards are drawn or taken.  
- **Do I score for ejection during End Game?**  
  Yes. Placing a token on the score card for the ejected animal still applies.
