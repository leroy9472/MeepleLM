## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Zombie Fluxx is a fast-paced, ever-changing card game where players collect Keepers, manage Creepers, and adapt to shifting rules in a chaotic zombie-infested world. The objective is to be the first player to meet the current Goal’s conditions—while avoiding Creepers that prevent victory.

### 2. Components  
- One "Basic Rules" card  
- A deck of cards including:  
  - Rule Cards (including "New Rules")  
  - Goal Cards  
  - Action Cards  
  - Keeper Cards (possessions)  
  - Creeper Cards (undesirable possessions)  
  - Surprise Cards  
  - Ungoal Cards  

### 3. Setup  
- Place the "Basic Rules" card in the center of the table. It remains in play for the entire game.  
- Shuffle the remaining deck.  
- Deal 3 cards face down to each player.  
- Each player draws their hand.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, follow these steps in order:  

1. **Draw Phase**: Draw the number of cards currently required by the Draw rule (starts at 1).  
2. **Play Phase**: Play the number of cards currently required by the Play rule (starts at 1).  
   - Cards are played face up.  
   - Each card played must have its instructions followed completely, if possible—even if it helps another player win.  
   - Playing a card may trigger optional actions (e.g., drawing or discarding more cards); these are resolved immediately as part of the same play.  
3. **Hand Limit**: Discard down to the current Hand Limit, if one is in effect.  
4. **Keeper Limit**: Discard Keepers down to the current Keeper Limit, if one is in effect.  

**Optional Actions**: Some cards (e.g., Surprises) may be played outside of your turn or during any step. These exceptions are allowed when specified.  

**End of Turn**: After completing all four steps, the turn ends and play passes to the left.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Rule Cards  
- The "Basic Rules" card is always in play.  
- "New Rules" modify game parameters (e.g., Draw, Play, Hand Limit, Keeper Limit).  
- When a New Rule is played, place it face up next to Basic Rules.  
- If a new Rule contradicts an existing New Rule, discard the older one immediately.  
- New Rules take effect instantly.  

#### Goal Cards  
- Played face up in the center, replacing any previous Goal.  
- The game starts with no Goal—no one can win until a Goal is in play.  
- Players win instantly when they meet the Goal’s conditions.  

#### Action Cards  
- One-time use. Follow the instructions, then discard.  
- Actions may allow additional card plays or draws; all effects are part of a single play.  
- Some Actions may have no effect depending on game state.  

#### Keeper Cards  
- Played in front of you; represent possessions.  
- Some Rules limit how many Keepers a player can have.  
- Must be discarded down to the limit during the Keeper Limit step.  

#### Creeper Cards  
- When drawn, reveal immediately and place in front of you. Does not count as a play.  
- Draw a replacement card after playing a Creeper.  
- If you have any Creeper in front of you, you cannot win—even if you meet the Goal.  
- Creepers stay in play until removed by a card effect.  

#### Surprise Cards  
- Can be played:  
  a) During your turn as a regular play.  
  b) During another player’s turn to cancel certain actions (e.g., other players’ Actions or Surprises—check card text and colors).  
- Have immediate effects and are then discarded.  

#### Ungoal Cards  
- Special Goal-like cards that trigger if their conditions are met.  
- When an Ungoal is fulfilled, **all players lose immediately**.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends **instantly** when:  
  - A player meets the conditions of the current Goal **and** has no Creepers preventing victory. That player wins.  
  - An Ungoal condition is met. All players lose.  
- Victory can occur during any player’s turn—even if it’s not the winning player’s turn.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Empty Deck**: If the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.  
- **Discarding**: Players cannot discard voluntarily unless forced by a Hand or Keeper Limit.  
- **Card Effects**: All instructions on a played card must be followed if possible—even if it causes another player to win.  
- **Creeper Interaction**: Creepers block winning even if you have all required Keepers.  
- **Starting Hand**: If a player has a Creeper in their initial 3-card hand, they must play it immediately and draw a replacement.
