## Amazonas — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are researchers exploring the Amazon rainforest in the early 19th century, establishing research stations (huts) in remote villages to collect specimen tokens representing butterflies, orchids, fish, parrots, and reptiles. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VPs) by:  
- Collecting 3 or more of each specimen type (score VPs equal to number collected, per type with ≥3).  
- Completing sets of one of each of the 5 specimen types (bonus disks).  
- Building huts in the 4 villages listed on your secret mission card (+3 VPs per completed hut).  
- Gaining majorities in specimen types (in 2-player variant only).  

The game ends after 18 rounds. The player with the most VPs wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player receives:  
   - 12 huts in their color  
   - 7 income cards in their color  
   - 3 gold coins (1 gold = 3 silver)  
2. Shuffle the 8 secret mission cards; deal 1 to each player face-down. Return the rest to the box unseen.  
3. Shuffle the 18 event cards to form a face-down deck.  
4. Sort specimen tokens by type and place them near the board.  
5. Place bonus disks, native tokens, turn order cards, and remaining coins next to the board.  
6. For 3 players: remove bonus disk #5 and turn order card #4.  
7. Youngest player goes first. In clockwise order, each player:  
   - Places 1 hut in any village  
   - Pays gold equal to the number of nuggets on the chosen building site (2 or 3)  
   - Collects 1 specimen token shown in that village  

All components (coins, tokens, huts) must be visible to all players.

### 4. Gameplay Flow (per round, 18 rounds total)  
**1. Draw an Event Card**  
- Reveal the top card of the event deck. Its effect applies to all players this round.

**2. Play Income Cards**  
- Each player secretly chooses 1 income card and places it face-down.  
- All players reveal simultaneously.  
- Base income = card value + number of specimen tokens matching the type shown on the card.  
- Special cards:  
  - **0-value card**: income = number of tokens in your most numerous specimen type.  
  - **6-value ("Indio") card**: income = 6 + number of native tokens you control. Immune to negative event effects this round.  
- After playing the 7th card, retrieve all 7 income cards and reuse them.

**3. Determine Turn Order**  
- Players rank by base income (highest = #1).  
- Tiebreaker: highest-numbered income card (white number in top center) wins the lower turn order card (e.g., wins #1).  
- In variants using copper coins: tiebreaker is highest-numbered copper coin; coins are swapped after determining order.

**4a. Take Income**  
- In turn order (#1 to last), each player:  
  - Receives income in silver, modified by event card:  
    - Forest Fire: income halved, rounded down  
    - Other events affect later steps  
  - May convert 3 silver → 1 gold at any time  
  - Money must remain visible

**4b. Build Huts**  
- On your turn, you may build **as many huts as you can afford**, following:  
  - Must connect via jungle path or river route to an existing hut of yours  
  - Only 1 hut per player per village (ever)  
  - Pay gold equal to nuggets shown on the building site  
  - Collect 1 specimen token shown in the village (if available)  
- Neutral huts (2-player only): see **Core Mechanics**

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Event Cards  
| Card | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Jaguar (×2)** | Cannot use jungle paths this round; only river routes |
| **Crocodile (×2)** | Cannot use river routes this round; only jungle paths |
| **Forest Fire (×3)** | All players receive half income (rounded down) |
| **Theft (×2)** | After income, pay silver equal to size of your largest specimen set (incl. native-assigned types). Pay what you can if insufficient. |
| **Bonus (×5)** | After income, gain +1 silver per specimen token matching the type shown (incl. native-assigned tokens) |
| **Natives (×4)** | Native token is placed on card. During turn order, each player may forfeit income to take it. If all pass, it returns to box. Must assign immediately to a specimen type you have ≥1 of. Counts as 1 token of that type for income, events, and bonuses. Also adds +1 to 6-value income card per native token. |

#### Bonus Disks  
- First player to collect **1 of each of the 5 specimen types** (not including native tokens) receives the highest-value bonus disk:  
  - 4 players: 5, 4, 3, 2  
  - 3 players: 4, 3, 2  
  - 2 players: 4, 2  
- Additional majority bonus disk (value 1): awarded to player with most tokens in a type (≥3). Lost if tied.

#### Neutral Huts (2-player variant only)  
- Each player gets 6 neutral (gray) huts.  
- On your turn, you may build **1 neutral hut** in addition to regular huts.  
- Rules:  
  - No cost to build  
  - Only 1 neutral hut per village  
  - Cannot build on last empty space in a village  
  - Must build on cheapest available space in the village  
  - Must connect via path/river to one of your huts (not necessarily neutral)  
- Purpose: block opponent or control access

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after 18 rounds (all event cards played). Score as follows:  

**Victory Points (VPs):**  
- For each specimen type where you have **3 or more tokens**: score **1 VP per token** in that type (including native tokens assigned to it)  
- **Bonus disks**:  
  - Set completion: value of disk (5/4/3/2 or 4/2)  
  - Majority in a type (≥3): 1 VP (disappears on tie)  
- **Secret mission card**: +3 VPs for each village on your card where you built a hut  
  - −3 VPs for each village on your card where you did **not** build  

**Total = Sum of above**

**Tiebreakers (in order):**  
1. Most specimen tokens (including native tokens)  
2. Most leftover money  
3. Highest-numbered copper coin (if variant used)  

**2-Player Variant Additional Scoring:**  
- After main scoring, award **1 VP** to the player with the most tokens in each specimen type (≥1 token), **no points on tie**  
- Example: 4 butterflies + majority = 5 VPs (4 for count, 1 for majority)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I build multiple huts in one turn?**  
A: Yes, if you can afford them and they are legally connected.

**Q: Can I build a hut in a village with only one space left using a neutral hut?**  
A: No. Neutral huts cannot be placed on the last free space in a village.

**Q: What happens if two players tie for first in set completion?**  
A: The first to complete the set gets the higher bonus disk. Turn order determines "first" if simultaneous.

**Q: Can I assign a native token to a specimen type I have zero of?**  
A: No. You must assign it to a type where you already have at least one token.

**Q: Does the 6-value income card protect from all event effects?**  
A: Only from **negative** effects (e.g., Forest Fire, Theft, Jaguar, Crocodile). It does not block Natives or Bonus.

**Q: When do I get my income cards back?**  
A: Immediately after playing your 7th income card (after round 7 or 14), shuffle and reuse all 7.

**Q: Can I build a neutral hut and a colored hut in the same village?**  
A: Yes, as long as:  
- Only one neutral hut per village  
- You don’t place neutral hut on last space  
- Both huts connect legally
