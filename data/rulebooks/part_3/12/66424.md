## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Dungeon Run is a competitive dungeon-crawling board game where heroes explore a procedurally generated dungeon, battle monsters, collect treasures and artifacts, and vie for power. The objective shifts when the Endgame begins: after the Boss is defeated and a hero acquires the Summoning Stone, that hero becomes the Summoner and must survive until the end of their turn on the Entrance Tile or be the last hero alive to win.

- Encounter deck (monsters, traps, strangers)  
- Treasure deck  
- Artifact cards (Summoning Stone, Sword of the Well Spirit, Doom Glaive, Forbidden Tome)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the Dungeon Entrance tile in the center and the Boss Lair tile nearby.  
2. Shuffle one Boss card and place it face down under the Boss Lair tile.  
3. Create a tile deck: 4 Standard and 2 Special tiles per player (use all if 5–6 players). Shuffle and place face down.  
4. Shuffle the Encounter and Treasure decks separately. Place Artifact cards and markers within reach.  
5. Players roll dice; highest roller takes the First Player token.  
6. In clockwise order, each player selects a hero. The first four heroes chosen must have different training types (Prayer, War, Magic, Talent).  
7. Each player draws 2 ability cards, chooses 1 to keep, and discards the other.  
8. Place hero miniatures on the Entrance tile.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this sequence:  
1. **Summon (Endgame only):** The Summoner (hero with Summoning Stone) may perform a free Summon action.  
2. **Player Turns:** Starting with the First Player, each hero takes a turn.  
3. **Monsters Roam:** All monsters not on a tile with a non-KO’d hero move to an adjacent tile (or teleport, if Boss).  
4. **Pass First Player Token:** Clockwise to the next player.

Each **Player Turn** consists of:  
- If KO’d last turn: Stand up and end turn.  
- Otherwise: Perform up to 2 Actions and any number of Free Actions.  
- If the hero remains on a monster tile all turn without battling, the monster makes a Free Attack.  
- Endgame: The Summoner wins if on the Entrance Tile at the end of their turn or if they are the only survivor.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions  
- **Move (to existing tile):** Only if no monster or hero is on the current tile. Move via exit.  
  - To Standard tile: No additional effect.  
  - To Special tile: Follow tile rules.  
- **Move (no tile placed):** Draw and place a tile.  
  - Cannot block exits. Discard unplaceable tiles; shuffle back after action.  
  - **Standard tile:** Roll one die to place Treasure (face down) and/or Encounter (face up).  
    - Monster: Free Battle.  
    - Trap: Free Disarm.  
  - **Special tile:** Follow tile instructions.  
  - **After last tile is placed:** Place Boss Lair tile and Boss card face-up in the farthest legal location from Entrance.  

- **Escape:** Attempt to move when a monster is present.  
  - Roll dice = Skill rating.  
  - Any die ≥ monster’s Escape Rating = successful escape.  
  - Fail: Monster makes a Free Attack.  
  - **Endgame only:** If escaping from heroes only (no monsters), roll 4+ to escape. No Free Attack on fail.  

- **Battle (vs Monster):**  
  1. Other heroes may Assist or Sabotage.  
  2. Monster attacks: Roll dice = Attack rating. Dice matching Power rating are potential hits.  
  3. Hero attacks: Roll dice = Brawn or Magic rating (choice).  
  4. Damage:  
     - Hero dice ≥ Defense Rating: can Hit or Block.  
     - Hero dice = potential hit (but < Defense): can Block only.  
  5. Unblocked hits = wound markers.  
  6. If monster defeated: place in hero’s loot pile and Rally.  
  7. If Boss defeated: place Summoning Stone face-up on tile.  

- **Battle (vs Hero):** Only if no monsters on tile.  
  1. Sabotage/Assist allowed for attacker only.  
  2. Both roll Brawn or Magic.  
  3. Defender: 4+ = Hit. Attacker: 4+ = Hit or Block.  
  4. Endgame: Attacker must survive before assigning hits.  
  5. Allocate damage; armor may reduce wounds.

  - Summoner does not gain token immediately upon equipping Summoning Stone.  
  - Token passes after the round ends and monsters have roamed.  

- **Monsters:**

  - **Colossus of Galnon:** After battle damage is assigned, if alive, deals 1 wound to each hero on tile.  
  - **Slime Acidic:** Does not affect Artifacts (Artifacts ≠ Treasures).  
  - **Boss:** Counts as a Monster.  

- **Tiles:**  
  - **Cursed Stone:** Prevents all hero abilities on and adjacent tiles.  
  - **Portcullis Room:** To exit, roll Brawn; 4+ to move. Fail = 1 wound (2 if monster present but cannot battle).  
  - **Underground Channel:** Roll Brawn (or Skill if Talent-trained); need two 4+ to cross safely. Else, 2 wounds.  
  - **Ancient Bridge:** Roll Skill; if all dice are 1s, take 10 wounds.  
  - **Glyph Room:** Draw 1 encounter card when revealed. Only assisted heroes can battle here. Monsters cannot roam (Boss can).  
  - **Library:** Roll die: 1 = 1 wound; 5+ = secretly view Boss card.  
  - **Well Room:** Draw 1 encounter. If no monsters, discard 1 treasure and roll die: 3+ = gain Sword of the Well Spirit (if not already owned).  
  - **Den:** On entry, if no encounter, roll to generate one.  

- **Artifacts:**  
  - **Summoning Stone:** Dropped by Boss. Must be searched to equip. Triggers Endgame.  
  - **Sword of the Well Spirit:** From Well Room (via event).  
  - **Doom Glaive:** From Dwarf Artificer event.

    - Infernal Pact not triggered by assisting/sabotaging.  
    - Demonic Visage blocks Move actions only, not Escape.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Endgame Trigger:** A hero equips the Summoning Stone (after defeating Boss and searching the tile).  
- **Win Condition:** The Summoner wins if:  
  - They survive to the end of their turn while on the Entrance Tile, **or**  
  - They are the only hero still alive.  
- **Defeated Heroes:**  
  - **Before Endgame:** Knocked Out (KO’d). Lose turn, wounds halved (round down), leave 1 treasure/artifact face up. Return next turn.  
  - **During Endgame:** Killed. All treasures/artifacts placed face up. If killed by another hero, killer may take all. Rest removed.  
- **Optional Rule:** *Beg for Your Life* – If all other heroes vote “no” when a hero is defeated pre-Endgame, they are killed instead of KO’d.

- **Cursed Stone Adjacency:** Tiles connected by hallway exits are adjacent.  
- **Boss Lair Placement:** Based on longest legal path from Entrance.  
- **Monster Free Attack on KO Recovery:** No. Recovery is not a turn.
