# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In *Dungeon!*, players take on the roles of adventurers exploring a dangerous dungeon beneath Darkpain Castle. An ancient evil has broken free from its seal, threatening the nearby village of Thatchum and the lands of Mondovia. Heroes must descend into the dungeon to defeat monsters, collect treasure, and ultimately confront the dungeon’s boss, Magaroth Darkpain.

The **objective** is to be the first player (or team) to collect the required amount of treasure (based on character class), return to the Great Hall, and defeat the dungeon boss in a final showdown. If all heroes are defeated, the dungeon wins.

## 2. Components
- Game board depicting a six-level dungeon with corridors, rooms, and chambers
- Player pawns (standard and new classes)
- Monster and Prize cards (color-coded by dungeon level)
- Number tokens and Cleared tokens
- Spell cards (Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Teleport)
- Special treasure items (e.g., Magic Sword, ESP Medallion, Crystal Ball)
- Acrylic gemstone or bead (for Shadowstone of Demogorgon)
- Gravestone tokens (for tracking class abilities and foul minions)
- Hero log-sheets (for solo variant)
- Doom track and threat box (for solo variant)
- Optional Chamber Cards (Halls of Chromatic Tears)

## 3. Setup
1. Lay out the board and identify the six dungeon levels by color:

   - Three Monster cards in each large chamber (face down)

3. Place the **Shadowstone of Demogorgon** (5000 GP treasure) guarded by the 'Evil Cleric' (Mordecai) on the space below the southernmost Level 4 room.

4. Place the **boss figure (Magaroth Darkpain)** off-board until triggered.

5. Each player chooses a hero class (Rogue, Cleric, Fighter, Wizard, Dwarf, Elf, or Halfling) and places their pawn on the Start space in the Great Hall.

6. For **foul minions variant**: Prepare Orc and Drow monster cards and tokens.

7. For **solo play**: Select Rogue and one other hero (Wizard, Cleric, or Fighter), place log-sheets, and set up threat pool with 5 threat tokens.

  - Boss plays one spell per round (Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Teleport); heroes must guess.
    - Correct guess: Hero rolls 4d6 to get a double and strike.
    - Incorrect guess: Boss removes one treasure from a hero.
  - If hero runs out of treasure, they are killed.
  - **Difficulty progression**:
    - First attack: 4d6, need double.
    - Second attack (after hero death): 3d6, need double (team gets one re-roll).
    - Third+: 2d6, need double (team re-roll allowed).

- **Loss Conditions**:
  - All heroes killed.
  - In solo variant: Doom Track reaches skull before both heroes return.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Do spells work against other wizards?** No, wizards have magical resistance.
- **Can you use Teleport to escape combat?** Yes, Wizard can use Teleport to flee.
- **What if the boss is defeated but no hero has enough treasure?** The first hero to return with goal treasure and defeat the boss wins.
- **Can you bank treasure?** Only in optional Banking rule: treasure banked during rest cannot be lost but cannot be used.
