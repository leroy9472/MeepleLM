## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**
   - Players take on the role of Planeswalkers—powerful mages capable of traversing the Multiverse.
   - The objective depends on the chosen battlefield scenario:
     - **The Duel (2 players)**: Destroy the opponent’s Planeswalker. If no player achieves this by turn 30, the player with the most cost points on the battlefield wins.
     - **The Skirmish (4 players, 2 teams)**: Destroy both opposing Planeswalkers. If no team wins by turn 60, the team with the most cost points wins.
     - **The Melee (3–5 players)**: At game end (36/48/60 turns), the player with the most cost points on designated purple “power glyph” spaces wins.

2. **Components**
   - 5 Planeswalker figures (Gideon, Jace, Liliana, Chandra, Nissa)
   - 30 squad figures
   - 15 army cards (including 5 Planeswalker cards)
   - 60 spell cards (12 per color)
   - 6 cardboard terrain boards
   - 2 ruins
   - 2 × 3-hex sand tiles, 2 × 1-hex sand tiles
   - 4 glyphs: Glyph of Power, Glyph of Toughness, Glyph of Movement, Glyph of Knowledge
   - 30 damage markers
   - 10 combat dice
   - 1 twenty-sided die
   - 1 turn marker

3. **Setup**
   - Choose a battlefield based on player count and assemble it as shown in the guide.
   - Each player:
     - Selects a Planeswalker and takes matching army cards, figures, and spell cards.
     - Builds a premade army of exactly 500 points containing one Planeswalker.
     - Army cards must match the Planeswalker’s color (or be artifacts).
     - Unique army cards may appear only once per player; common cards may be duplicated.
     - Builds a spell deck of 12 cards with total cost ≤ 200.
     - Places Planeswalker army card in play; all other army cards and figures go to the reserve.
     - Shuffles spell deck (library) and draws 3 cards.
   - Roll a d20 to determine first player (highest roll). In team games, highest team rolls, and the leftmost player on that team goes first.
   - Players place Planeswalkers in starting zones (no two in the same zone).
   - Place turn marker on space 1.

4. **Gameplay Flow**
   A turn follows this structure:
   1. **Draw a spell card** (if Planeswalker is on battlefield; first player skips this on turn 1 in 2-player).
   2. **Choose an army card** to activate.
      - Only activated army card’s abilities may be used.
      - If a Planeswalker is chosen, may summon up to 2 squads/heroes from reserve within 5 clear sight spaces.
   3. **Move** any or all figures on the activated army card (one at a time).
   4. **Attack** with any or all figures on the activated army card (one at a time).
   5. **End phase**:
      - Resolve end-of-turn and end-of-army-turn abilities.
      - Discard down to 7 spell cards if over limit.
      - Advance turn marker.
      - Check victory/end conditions.

5. **Core Mechanics**
   - **Clear Sight**: Required for summoning. The Planeswalker must have line of sight to at least one hex of the summoned figure. For double-space figures, only one base hex needs to be within 5 spaces and visible.
   - **Line of Sight (LoS)**:
     - Determined from the green target point on the attacking figure to any part of the defender’s hit zone.
     - No facing; LoS is 360°.
     - Obstacles block LoS unless figure height exceeds obstacle.
   - **Movement**:
     - Move value limits spaces moved.
     - Moving up counts each level edge as a space.
     - Moving down does not count edges, but falling occurs when descending a height ≥ figure’s height, risking 1 damage (roll combat die for crossed weapons).
     - Water ends movement unless a double-space figure moves across one water space between land.
     - Moving from water to land costs 1 extra space.
     - Double-space figures must end on two same-level spaces.
     - Flipping a double-space figure is free and does not provoke leaving engagement.
   - **Engagement**:
     - Occurs when adjacent to an enemy figure and heights allow engagement (neither is on a ledge ≥ opponent’s height).
     - Leaving engagement allows opponent to make a free attack (1 die, no defense).
     - Multiple engagements allow multiple leaving attacks.
   - **Combat**:
     - Announce attacker and defender.
     - Attacker rolls Power dice; defender rolls Toughness dice.
     - Crossed weapons = hits; shields block hits.
     - Unblocked hits deal damage.
     - Height advantage: +1 die to attack or defense if base is higher.
     - Glyphs and spells modify combat.
   - **Damage & Destruction**:
     - Squad figures: damage markers go on figure base.
     - Unique heroes and Planeswalkers: damage markers go on army card.
     - When damage ≥ Life, the figure is destroyed and placed in figure graveyard.
     - When all figures on an army card are destroyed, the card goes to army card graveyard; attached enchantments go to their owner’s graveyard.
   - **Spells**:
     - Sorceries: resolve immediately, go to graveyard.
     - Enchantments (Auras): attach to valid army card.
     - Hidden enchantments: played face down on own army cards; must be triggered when condition met or are removed from game.
     - Spell limit: 3 per turn.
     - Spells can be played after Action 1 and before Action 3, or after Action 4 and before Action 5.
     - Countered spells go to graveyard with no effect.
   - **Activated Abilities**:
     - Can only be used on the turn the corresponding army card is activated.
     - Can be used before moving, after moving/before attacking, after attacking.
     - Cannot be used mid-move or mid-combat.
     - Examples: Jace’s Focused Thoughts, Chandra’s Super Heated, Liliana’s Snuff Out.
   - **Returning Figures**:
     - Figures returned to reserve (e.g., via Unsummon) lose all damage and enchantments.
     - They can be resummoned from reserve.
     - Abilities like Rebirth (Flamewing Phoenix) or Darkness Arises (Restless Zombies) can return figures from graveyard.

6. **Scoring & End Game**
   - Game ends when a victory condition is met or the turn limit is reached.
   - If time-limited, the winner is determined by scoring:
     - Total the PPF (Price Per Figure) cost of all figures on the battlefield.
     - In The Melee, only figures on purple power glyph spaces count.
   - In team games, team totals are summed.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**
   - **Spell Countering**: A countered spell is not considered "played" (e.g., Rebirth does not trigger if sorcery is countered).
   - **Hidden Enchantments**: Forgotten triggers are removed from the game (not graveyard).
   - **Enchantments on Dead Units**: When an army card is destroyed, attached auras go to their owner’s graveyard.
   - **Mind Control**: You control the targeted enemy creature for movement and attack; it is friendly during this time. Cannot use its activated abilities.
   - **Double-Space Summoning**: Only one hex of base needs to be within 5 clear sight spaces, but Planeswalker must see that hex.
   - **Simultaneous Damage**: Player whose turn it is chooses resolution order.
   - **Partial Summons**: Not allowed. Must summon full squad if figures are available; if some are destroyed, only surviving ones can be summoned (if any remain in reserve).
   - **Unsummon**: Returns entire squad to reserve; damage and enchantments are removed.
   - **Glyphs**:
     - Permanent: effect lasts while standing on it.
     - Temporary (Glyph of Knowledge): draw 1 spell card, then remove glyph.
   - **Falling**: Only applies to land; falling into water causes no damage.
