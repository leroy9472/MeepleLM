# HELLAS – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Hellas*, players take on the roles of rival Greek city-states expanding their influence across the Aegean. Through strategic placement, naval voyages, and military conquest, players grow their civilizations by placing Greeks in cities across newly discovered lands. The goal is to be the first to establish a presence in 10 cities.

### 2. Components
- 15 Greeks per player (in player color)
- 10 Ships per player (in player color)
- 1 Summary card per player
- 24 Map tiles (including 1 starting dolphin tile)
- 3 Decks of God cards: Ares, Poseidon, Zeus
- God card discard piles (3)

### 3. Setup
1. Each player selects a color and takes:
   - 15 Greeks
   - 10 Ships
   - 1 Summary card
2. Separate God cards into three decks: Ares, Poseidon, and Zeus.
3. Shuffle each deck and place them facedown.
4. Each player draws 1 card from each deck (3 total) as their starting hand. Keep hands secret.
5. Place the **dolphin map tile** faceup in the center.
6. Shuffle the remaining 23 map tiles into a facedown stack.

### 4. Initial Map Creation
1. The player with the light-colored figures goes first.
2. On your turn:
   - Draw the top tile from the stack.
   - Place it adjacent to the dolphin tile **or** adjacent to **two** already-placed tiles.
   - Match land/water edges exactly.
   - Place **1 Greek** on the city and **1 Ship** next to the city (both from your supply).
3. If the drawn tile:
   - Cannot be legally placed → set aside.
   - Has a temple → set aside.
4. Alternate turns until each player has placed **4 tiles** (8 total).
5. After initial placement:
   - Shuffle the set-aside tiles back into the remaining stack to form a new draw pile.
6. The player with light figures takes the first turn of the main game.

### 5. Gameplay Flow
On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

#### Option 1: Burst of Strength

### 9. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I look at God cards after Burst of Strength?**  
  Yes. You may review your hand after completing the action.

- **Can I attack a city with no Greeks?**  
  No. All cities must have at least one Greek. A city cannot be empty.

- **What if I run out of ships during a Voyage?**  
  You must still return one ship from an adjacent tile. If you have no ships, you cannot complete the Voyage.

- **Can I place a tile that only touches one tile, if it's the dolphin?**  
  Yes. The dolphin tile is special: new tiles may be placed adjacent to it (with matching edges), even if only touching one tile.

- **Can I play a God card during an opponent’s Attack?**  
  Yes, **if** the card is marked for use during opponent’s turn.

- **Do ships contribute to defense?**  
  No. Only Greeks matter in combat. Ships are used only for Voyage placement and naval connectivity.
