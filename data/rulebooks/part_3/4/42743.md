### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of 9 rounds consists of 4 phases:

#### 1. Budget Phase
- Players secretly bid ducats behind their screens.
- All reveal simultaneously.
- Players move budget markers up by bid amount, highest first (by level, then leftmost column).
- Maximum budget is 10.

#### 2. Action Phase
- Player with highest budget (level, then leftmost) chooses first.
- A player may choose up to 3 roles per round (4 with 2 players).
- Choosing a role:
  - Pay the fee in budget levels (not ducats).
  - Take the role card.
  - Perform the role’s action.
  - Flip budget marker to show cross.
- **Employees (Impresario, Architetto, Signora):** Other players may “play along” after the chooser, in budget order.
  - Each action (buy piece, build, sell) costs 1 budget level.
  - Two actions cost 2 levels.
  - Playing along does not count toward the 3-role limit.
- **Characters (Maestro, Critico, Esperto):** Only the chooser may use the role. No playing along.
  - Character must be moved to a different city with a free spot.
  - If unused, remains in place.
- After all actions or passes:
  - All budget markers are flipped back (cross down).
  - Pass discs are removed.
  - Phase repeats with highest budget player.
- A player may end their turn by placing a pass disc on their marker.

#### 3. Income Phase
- Players earn income based on number of music pieces in each opera house:
  - 1 piece: 1 ducat
  - 2 pieces: 3 ducats
  - 3 pieces: 5 ducats
  - 4 pieces: 8 ducats
  - 5 pieces: 11 ducats
  - 6 pieces: 15 ducats
- No more than one piece per composer per opera house (city).
- House composer pieces count normally.
- If the Maestro is in a city, all income from that city is doubled.
- Opera houses max at 6 halls.

#### 4. End Phase
- **Fame Update:** Composer(s) with the most performed pieces move up one level on the fame ladder; others shift down.
- **Refresh Music:** Discard unclaimed music; draw new ones (5/7/9 for 2/3/4 players), max 3 per composer.
- **Reset Roles:** Return role cards to the board. Characters stay in place.
- **Palazzo:** If full (3 spaces for 2–3 players, 4 for 4), discard all pieces.
- **Budget Cleanup:** Remove pass discs. Budget markers stay, shifted leftmost per row. Players at level 0 receive 1 bonus ducat.
- **Advance Round Marker:** Move one space right.

**Counting Round (if marker lands on ornamented space):**
- Score points for music pieces in main halls (hall #1 with red pillars).
  - Value = composer’s fame level.
  - House composer = 0 points.
- Bonus: For the “Composer of the Century” (on the round track), gain:
  - 1 VP per piece (1st counting round)
  - 2 VP per piece (2nd)
  - 3 VP per piece (3rd)
- Minus 1 VP per empty hall.
- Empty the Palazzo.
- After 1st and 2nd counting rounds: reveal Paris/London, then Milano.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Employees
- **Impresario (fee: 3)**
  - Buy up to 2 music pieces (cost = composer fame).
  - Redistribute all music pieces among your halls and stock.
  - Playing along: 1 level for 1 piece + redistribution, or 2 levels for 2 pieces + redistribution. No purchase? Pay 1 level to redistribute.
- **Architetto (fee: 2)**
  - Build up to 2 building parts (max one opera house per city).
  - Cost: 2 ducats per hall.
  - Reward: 2 VPs per hall.
  - Wings can only be added to main buildings.
  - Halls must be built in ascending order (1, 2, 3...).
  - Playing along: 1 level per building part.
- **Signora (fee: 2)**
  - Sell one music piece (not house composer) from stock or hall to the Palazzo.
  - Choose: gain 2× composer fame in ducats, or 1× in VPs.
  - Max one piece per composer in Palazzo.
  - Playing along: 1 level. Cannot play along if Palazzo is full.

#### Characters
- **Maestro (fee: 2)**
  - Move green pawn to a different city with a free spot.
  - Doubles income from all opera houses in that city (all players) during Income Phase.
  - Remains in place if not moved.
- **Critico (fee: 3)**
  - Move black pawn to a different city with a free spot.
  - Choose a composer performing in that city.
  - Adjust their fame by up to ±2 levels; passed composers shift accordingly.
- **Esperto (fee: 4)**
  - Move purple pawn to a different city with a free spot.
  - Score VPs for all your music pieces in that city: 1 VP per fame level.
  - Then, give your best piece (highest fame) to the player with the fewest VPs (before scoring).
    - If you are lowest, discard it.
    - If tied, lowest budget (level, then leftmost) wins.
  - Other players may score too, but must discard their best piece (no budget cost).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends after the 3rd counting round.
- Final scoring:
  - Points from 3 counting rounds.
  - No additional endgame scoring.
- **Winner:** Player with most VPs.
- **Tiebreaker:** Highest budget position (level, then leftmost column).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Role Limit:** Only self-chosen roles count toward the 3/4 limit. Playing along does not.
- **Hall Numbers:** Indicate max theater size and must be built in ascending order.
- **Character Movement:** Cannot move to inactive cities (London, Paris, Milano before revealed).
- **Architetto Playing Along:** Yes, you score 2 VPs per hall like the main player.
- **Impresario Rearrangement:** Done immediately after buying, during your own turn.
- **Starting Money:** Not equal. 1st: 20, 2nd: 21, 3rd: 22, 4th: 23 ducats.
- **Budget for Roles:** Cannot use ducats; only budget levels.
- **Privilege for Choosing Role:** Only priority in action execution (e.g., first choice of music).
- **Multiple Buildings with Architetto:** Yes, even in different cities.
- **Impresario Rearrangement:** Only possible with Impresario (self or playing along).
- **Signora and Palazzo Count:** Only pieces in players’ theaters count for fame; Palazzo pieces do not.
- **Character Spaces:** London, Paris, Milano: 1 spot; Venezia, Wien, Berlin: 2 spots.
- **Critico Target:** Composer need not be in your theater; any performance in the city counts.
- **Esperto After Passing:** Yes, playing along with Esperto costs no budget.
- **Esperto Scoring:** All pieces in the city score, but best piece is discarded/given away.
- **Esperto Timing:** Determine recipient before scoring points.
- **Errata:** First print lacks one 1-ducat coin; Palazzo emptying occurs after every counting round.
