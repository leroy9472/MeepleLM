## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

1. Lore & Objective  
The game centers around Rattlebones, a mischievous figure who moves when players fail in gambling attempts. Players take on the roles of gamblers navigating a track, collecting resources (Gold, Stars, Stock Tickets), earning points, and strategically using die actions to outscore opponents. The objective is to accumulate the most points by the end of the game.

2. Components  
- Game board with track and score track  
- Pawns (1 per player)  
- Dice (standard and Gamble Die)  
- Gold pieces  
- Star tokens  
- Stock Tickets  
- Rattlebones token  

3. Setup  
- Each player places their pawn on the STORE/START space.  
- Place Gold, Stars, and Stock Tickets near the board in supply.  
- Place Rattlebones token near the board (starting position not specified).  
- One player is chosen to go first.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn:  
1. Roll dice (number not specified, but at least one die is used).  
2. Resolve die results one at a time. Some results may allow extra dice (e.g., GOLD, ROLL AGAIN).  
3. Move pawn if a movement action is taken (e.g., 9 PIP).  
4. Carry out space actions when landing on a space (e.g., STORE/START).  
5. After resolving all die results, turn ends and play passes clockwise.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **GOLD**: Take one Gold from the supply. Gold allows rolling an extra die on your turn.  
- **ROLL AGAIN**: Take an extra die and roll it together with your current die; resolve the new result.  
- **STAR**: Take one Star token. Stars can be used when landing on STORE/START.  
- **TRAIN**: Earn points based on the current position of the train. Then move the train one space forward.  
- **9 PIP**: Move one of your pawns 1–9 spaces forward. Upon landing, carry out the action of the space.  
- **POINTS**: Earn points equal to the number shown (1–5).  
- **THIEF**: Steal one Star, one Gold, or one Stock Ticket from *each* other player (choice per player).  
- **ARROW**: Perform the action shown on the die face to which the arrow points.  
- **1234**: Earn points equal to your current position on the score track.  
- **STOCK**: Take one Stock Ticket. When the last Stock Ticket is taken, all players immediately score their Stock Tickets: 1st place gets 10 points, 2nd place gets 5 points.  
- **X2**: If X2 appears with a die showing Gold, Stars, or Points, the reward from that die is doubled.  
- **GAMBLE**: Roll the Gamble Die. On a roll of 2–5, earn points equal to the roll. On a 1 or 6, move the Rattlebones token one space (direction not specified).  
- **STORE/START space**: When landing here, may sell 1–4 Stars for points: 1 Star = 3 pts, 2 Stars = 7 pts, 3 Stars = 11 pts, 4 Stars = 15 pts.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Points are earned throughout the game via die results, TRAIN, STOCK, and STORE/START.  
- Game ends when the last Stock Ticket is taken and scored.  
- Final scoring: Players total all points. Highest score wins.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Multiple X2 effects**: If multiple X2 dice are rolled, only one applies (unless specified otherwise). Clarification needed in full rules.  
- **GAMBLE and Rattlebones**: If Rattlebones is moved, no further effect is described. Likely thematic or triggers later effect not detailed here.  
- **STAR usage**: Stars are taken on STAR die result and used only when landing on STORE/START (presumably to sell).  
- **Movement limits**: 9 PIP allows 1–9 spaces; no mention of backward movement or passing START.  
- **Ties in STOCK scoring**: Not addressed; assume standard tie-breaking (e.g., most Stars, then Gold, etc.).
