### 3. Setup  
1. Each player takes their 21-card deck, shuffles it, and draws 5 cards.
2. Shuffle all tokens face-down.
3. Draw token pairs and place them face-up on shops:
   - **4–5 players**: 4 shops with 2 tokens each.
   - **3 players**: 3 shops with 2 tokens each.
   - **2 players**: 2 shops with 2 tokens each.
     - *Exception*: If both tokens in a pair are identical, redraw the pair.

Place shops in the center with space to build queues to the right.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, perform **three actions** in any order. Each action must be either:
- **Place one or more queue cards** to any shop’s queue, or
- **Draw one card** from your deck into your hand.

You may perform up to three such actions (e.g., play-play-draw, draw-draw-play, etc.).

**Important**: Between or during these actions, you may perform **free actions** at any time:
- Play a **Matka z Dzieckiem** card (no action cost).
- Use **Synku, Stan w Kolejce** to replace it with another of your tokenless cards (free action, any turn after placement).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### A. Progress Check (Mandatory First Step of Turn)
Before taking your three actions, you must **check your strength** on each queue:
- Total the point values of your cards in each queue.
- If your total is **strictly higher** than every other player in a queue:
  - **If two tokens are available**: Choose one to claim. Place it **face-up on one of your cards** in that queue. This token counts as a **negative modifier** to your future strength in that queue.
    - *Note*: You can claim both tokens over time, but the first claim weakens your position.
  - **If one token remains**: Claim it and place it **face-down in front of you**. The other player with a token in that queue takes theirs and places it **face-down** as well.
- **Exception**: If you are the only player with cards in a queue, you may claim a token even if your total is zero or negative.
- After claiming:
  - All cards in that queue are **discarded**.
  - If tokens remain in the pool, refill the shop with a new pair of tokens.

#### B. Card Placement Rules
- You may place:
  - One single queue card, or
  - A group of **identical** cards (same type and value).
- Cards are placed to the right of the shop, forming a queue.
- Queues persist across turns until resolved.

#### C. Special Card Abilities
- **Matka z Dzieckiem (Mother with Baby)**:
  - Worth 2 points.
  - Can be played **as a free action** at any time (does not count toward your 3 actions).
- **Listka Kolejkowa (Queue List)**:
  - When played, sets **all cards** in that queue (including opponents’) to **1 point** each for strength checks.
- **Pan Tu Nie Stal! (You Can't Stand Here!)**:
  - Worth 1 point.
  - May **replace** any opponent’s or your own **tokenless** queue card (must not have a token on it).
  - Replaced card is **discarded**.
  - Can also be played normally.
- **Synku, Stan w Kolejce (Son, Stand in the Queue)**:
  - Played normally (costs one action).
  - Later, as a **free action**, can be replaced by one of your **tokenless** cards from another queue.
  - Original "Son" card is **discarded**.
