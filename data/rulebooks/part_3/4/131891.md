## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Lost Legends*, players take on the roles of legendary heroes—Barbarian, Hunter, Warrior, Assassin, and Sorceress—venturing through three escalating levels of danger: the Ruins (Level 1), the Caves (Level 2), and the Demon Fortress (Level 3). The goal is to gain the most legend points by defeating monsters, collecting trophies, and earning experience. The player with the highest legend point total at the end of Level 3 wins and becomes the most renowned hero.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each level consists of two phases:

#### 1st Phase: Gear-Up  
- Shuffle current level’s equipment cards.  
- Deal 6 cards to each player.  
- Over 5 rounds:  
  - Each player selects one card from hand and places it face down.  
  - Pass remaining cards to the left.  
  - Reveal selected card and either:  
    - **Enhance a skill**: Turn card 180°, place under skill section (only skill icon visible). Gain skill or level it up. No gold earned.  
    - **Acquire equipment**: Pay gold cost (basic cost minus skill discounts). Add card to hero board in correct slot (Armor, Weapon, Spell, Artifact).  
- After 5 rounds, return the 6th card (unused) to the box.  
- Players may **turn existing equipment into skills** before paying for new equipment, to gain immediate discounts.

#### 2nd Phase: Combat Monsters  
- Shuffle monster pile; place face down in center.  
- Each player draws one monster and places it in front of their hero board.  
- Place one face-up monster card next to the pile.  
- Starting with starting player and proceeding clockwise:  
  1. **Reveal monster card** (if no face-up card, draw one).  
  2. **Select monster**:  
     - If monster in front: Attack or pass to first counterclockwise player without one (if any). Then draw or take face-up.  
     - If no monster: Take face-up or draw from pile. Can pass if valid recipient.  
  3. **Attack the monster**:  
     - Choose one weapon.  
     - Apply damage (basic + skill/mana-boosted).  
     - Apply monster damage modifiers (½, ×2, 0).  
     - If damage ≥ monster’s life, it is defeated.  
  4. **Monster attacks (if alive)**:  
     - Apply monster’s damage (melee, long-range, magic, chaos).  
     - Reduce with armor (breastplate, shield), spells, or artifacts.  
     - Helmets do not exhaust if effect unused; spells/artifacts exhaust when used.  
     - Apply extra monster effects (e.g., Charge, WHEN ATTACKING).  
  5. **Combat Result**:  
     - **Monster defeated**: Gain experience, gold, trophy, possibly challenge trophy and trophy token.  
     - **Player defeated**: Lose a skill (if possible), skip turns until phase end.  

#### End of Phase  
- When a player draws the last monster card, all players get one final turn.  
- Monsters not defeated escape (returned to box).  
- Players with challenge trophies gain legend points:  
  - 1 point per trophy at end of Level 1  
  - 2 points per trophy at end of Level 2  
  - 3 points per trophy at end of Level 3  
- Refresh all exhausted cards.  
- Reset life and mana markers to tokens.  
- Determine next starting player: player with fewest legend tokens (excluding experience and trophy token points). Tie: closest clockwise to previous starter.

#### End of Level  
Proceed to next level (1 → 2 → 3). All hero progress (skills, equipment, trophies) carries over.

#### Alternative Level End  
If all players are defeated, level ends immediately. No extra turns. Proceed to next level.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use a weapon’s exhaust effect via Copy Weapon?**  
  No. Copy Weapon only copies damage, not exhaust effects.

- **Can I use Polymorph/Transformation after attacking?**  
  No. Must be used before attacking.

- **Can I pass a monster to a defeated player?**  
  No. Only to players not defeated and without a monster.

- **What if monster pile is empty and I need to draw?**  
  Take the face-up monster. If no face-up, your turn ends.

- **Can I use armor after it’s exhausted?**  
  Breastplates and shields never exhaust. Helmets exhaust only when effect is used.

- **Can I refresh a card that’s already refreshed?**  
  Yes, if effect allows (e.g., Spellbook, Imbued Artifact).

- **Do I gain gold when passing a monster?**  
  Yes—gold is distributed when a monster is defeated, regardless of who passed it.

- **Can I use a skill from a card I just placed?**  
  Yes, if used to enhance a skill before paying for equipment.
