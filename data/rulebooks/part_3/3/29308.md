## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Beowulf is a three-act strategy board game inspired by the legendary tale of the hero Beowulf. Players take on the roles of rival thanes vying for glory and honor through heroic deeds, political influence, and moral choices. The game unfolds across three distinct narrative acts (Mead Hall, Act II, and Act III), each represented by a different side of the board. The objective is to accumulate the most Saga Points by the end of Act III through tactical tile placement, figure deployment, and use of special abilities.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with three sides: Act I (Mead Hall), Act II, and Act III  
- Player-colored figures:  
  - 4 Ships  
  - 3 Castles  
  - 2 Thanes  
  - 1 Beowulf  
- Tiles:  
  - Act I: Silver tiles (including Mead, Temptation, Valor, Treasure, Drunkenness, Gorge, Good Counsel, Golden Statue, Royal Dragon Horn, Treachery)  
  - Act II: Gold tiles  
  - Act III: Red tiles  
- Saga Points: Represented by coins; each player starts with 50  
- Draw Pool: Face-down stack of tiles for each Act

### 3. Setup  
#### Act I Setup:  
- Each player selects a color and takes the corresponding figures: 4 Ships, 3 Castles, 2 Thanes, 1 Beowulf.  
- Each player starts with 50 Saga Points.  
- Place the board with Act I (Mead Hall) side face up.  
- Shuffle all Act I (Silver) tiles and place them face down to form the Draw Pool.  
- Each player draws 2 tiles from the Draw Pool.  
- The youngest player goes first.

#### Acts II & III Setup:  
- At the end of an Act:  
  - Remove all figures from the board.  
  - Return **Ship** figures to their owners; discard all other figures (Castles, Thanes, Beowulf).  
  - Discard all tiles currently on the board and in the Draw Pool.  
  - **Tiles in players’ hands are kept** and carried into the next Act.  
- Flip the board to the next Act (Act II or Act III).  
- Shuffle the corresponding tile set (Gold for Act II, Red for Act III) to form a new Draw Pool.  
- Play resumes with the next player in turn order.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order. On a turn, a player must perform **two actions** in order:

1. **Draw a Tile**  
   - Draw one tile from the Draw Pool and add it to your hand.  
   - If the Draw Pool is empty, skip this action. You may still play a tile.

2. **Play One Action** (choose one):  
   - **Place a Tile** on an empty space of the board.  
     - Follow special tile rules when applicable.  
   - **Place a Figure** on an empty space of the board.  
     - Only **Ship** figures are returned to the owner at the start of the next Act.  
     - All other figures are discarded after the Act ends.

After both actions, the turn passes to the next player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Tile Placement Rules  
- Tiles must be placed on empty board spaces.  
- Players may hold up to unlimited tiles in hand.  
- When the Draw Pool is exhausted, players continue playing without drawing.

#### Special Tile Abilities (Triggered after placement)  
- **Temptation**: May discard one **Valor** tile in play.  
- **Valor**: May discard one **Temptation** tile in play.  
- **Treasure**: Choose to either:  
  - Place on board as a normal tile, or  
  - Discard and gain immediate Saga Points equal to the number on the gold icon.  
- **Mead**: Place normally. Can later be replaced by a Drunkenness tile.  
- **Drunkenness**: Choose to either:  
  - Place as a normal peril tile, or  
  - Replace a **Mead** tile already in play (discard the Mead tile).  
- **Golden Statue**: Immediately swap positions of any two **tiles** on the board. Figures are not moved.  
- **Good Counsel**:  
  - Select one figure you control on the board.  
  - Move it to an orthogonally adjacent empty space.  
  - Place the Good Counsel tile in the space the figure vacated.  
  - *This is the only way to move a figure after placement.*  
- **Royal Dragon Horn**: Add **one scoring diamond** to each **figure** (not tile) in its row and column.  
  - Multiple Dragon Horns can stack bonuses on the same figure.  
  - Does not affect tile values.  
- **Treachery**:  
  - Cancels **positive values** of all tiles in its row and column.  
  - Negative values are unaffected.  
  - Before scoring, turn all canceled positive tiles **face down**.  
- **Gorge**:  
  - Divides its row and column into two separate segments.  
  - Each segment is scored independently.  
  - Pre-printed Gorge tiles on Act II board function identically.

#### Scoring Diamonds  
- Figures have a number of diamonds (value) printed on them.  
- These are used during scoring: (Number of diamonds) × (sum of all tiles in row/column).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### End of an Act  
An Act ends when:  
- All board spaces are filled, OR  
- (Unlikely) No player has any figures or tiles left to play.

**Scoring Formula**:  
For each completed row and column:  
> **20 + (Total diamonds of figures in row/column) × (Sum of all tile values in that row/column)**

- Apply modifiers before calculating:  
  - **Treachery**: Turn positive tiles face down (they contribute 0).  
  - **Gorge**: Split the row/column into two independent parts; score each separately.  
- Award Saga Points accordingly.

#### Game End and Victory Condition  
- The game ends after **Act III**.  
- The player with the **most Saga Points** wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: The player with the most **diamonds on unplayed figures** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a tile without drawing if the Draw Pool is empty?**  
  Yes. You may always play a tile from your hand even if you can’t draw.

- **Are tiles in hand discarded between Acts?**  
  No. Players keep all tiles in hand between Acts.

- **Are all figures removed at the end of an Act?**  
  Yes, but **only Ship figures are returned** to players. All others are discarded.

- **Can Good Counsel move an opponent’s figure?**  
  No. You may only move a figure **you control** (i.e., of your color).

- **Can Golden Statue move tiles with figures on them?**  
  No. Golden Statue swaps **tiles**, not figures. Figures stay in place; only the underlying tile moves.

- **Does Royal Dragon Horn affect tiles?**  
  No. It only adds **one diamond** to **figures** in its row and column.

- **How do multiple Gorge tiles interact in one row?**  
  Each Gorge divides the row/column into segments. Multiple Gorges create multiple isolated sections, each scored separately.

- **Can I replace a Mead tile with Drunkenness on my own board space?**  
  Yes, as long as the Mead tile is in play and accessible.
