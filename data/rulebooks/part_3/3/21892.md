## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players represent wealthy financiers in Augsburg in 1520, lending money to five regional nobles in exchange for privileges. These privileges can be converted into prestige points over the course of the game. To score beyond certain thresholds (25 or 45 points), players must construct a Church or Cathedral, respectively. The game ends after $ n + 2 $ rounds (where $ n $ = number of players). The player with the most prestige points wins. Tiebreakers: highest-cost Cathedral, then highest-cost Church.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Step Tiles**: Sort by color and size. For $ N $ players:  
   - Always place 1 Large tile per color  
   - Place $ N - 2 $ Medium tiles per color (minimum 1)  
   - Place $ N $ Small tiles per color  
   Stack each color’s tiles in order: Large → Medium → Small  

2. **Privilege Tiles**: Sort into 6 stacks by color, type, and number (highest on top). Place to the left of the board.

3. **Privilege Cards**: Shuffle the 10 cards. Place 5 face-up to the right of the board.

4. **Markers**:  
   - Start player receives Auction marker disc.  
   - Place Round marker on the space corresponding to player count.

5. **Player Materials**:  
   - Each player takes:  
     - Matching-color player board and disc  
     - 1500 Guilders  
     - 2 Joker cards  
   - Shuffle remaining Debt cards and deal 7 to each player.  
   - Form a draw pile with remaining cards.

6. **Initial Purchase**:

   - Unpurchased cards are discarded face-up (used later in auctions).  
   - Purchased cards go into hand.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has three phases:

#### Phase 1: Auction Phase (5 auctions per round)  
Repeat for each of the 5 nobles (left to right):

**A. Move Auction Marker**  
Place the Auction marker on the next noble space.

**B. Bidding**  
- Starting with the previous auction’s winner (first auction: start player), players take turns bidding.  
- Each bid is a number (minimum 1).  
- Players may:  
  - **Pass** (exit auction permanently)  
  - **Call** (match current bid)  
  - **Raise** (offer higher number)  
- Bidding continues clockwise until all remaining players have matched the highest bid or passed.  
- Players cannot raise their own bid.

**C. Reveal and Resolve Bids**  
- All players who matched the bid reveal exactly that many cards.  
- Cards must be:  
  - Matching the current noble’s suit, OR Jokers  
  - **Exception (Maximilian)**: Any combination of noble cards allowed (but at least one non-Joker required)  
- Must include at least **one non-Joker card matching the noble** (except Maximilian round)  

- Compare **highest single card value** among bidders:  
  - **Highest**: Wins auction. Discards all bid cards.  
  - **Second highest**: Takes 100 Guilders from bank; keeps cards.  
  - **Third highest**: Takes 50 Guilders from bank; keeps cards.  
  - Others: Get nothing; keep cards.  
- If only 1 or 2 players match the bid, lower payouts are skipped.

**D. Choose Privilege Card & Execute Actions**  
- Winner selects one available Privilege card.  
- Executes **2 of the 3 options** listed on the card:  

  1. **Increase level** in that color (take next step tile):  
     - If unavailable, take from another player. That player chooses:  
       - 100 Guilders, or  
       - 1 Prestige point  
     - When taking the 4th-level tile, return the 3rd-level tile to supply.  

  2. **Take the corresponding privilege** for current level in that color.  
     - Players may own only one of each privilege tile type.  

  3. **(Purple/Scroll only)**: Build Church or Cathedral.  
     - Pay cost. Take topmost building tile.  
     - **Builder privilege** allows building as a free action when executing two options.

> **Note**: Privilege cards with numbers (e.g., +500, +6/7, +2 cards) grant only that fixed reward. Blank spaces allow choice of one benefit.

---

#### Phase 2: Income Phase  
All players simultaneously receive income based on their **highest level** in each category:

- **Trade (Yellow)**: Receive Guilders as shown on highest Trade step tile.  
- **Nobility (Orange)**: Gain Prestige points as shown.  
  - Plus ongoing benefits from Privilege tiles (Coat of Arms, Letter of Nobility).  
- **Offices (Violet)**: Draw Debt cards as shown.  
  - Free cards (e.g., Minter) go directly to hand.  
  - Others must be paid for (placed face-down, then paid simultaneously).  

> **Final Round Exception**: Only prestige points are awarded; no money or cards.

> **Scoring Cap Rule**:  
> - Cannot exceed **25 prestige points** without a Church.  
> - Cannot exceed **45 prestige points** without a Cathedral.  
> - Violation not allowed under any circumstances.

---

#### Phase 3: End of Round  
- Discard any unused Privilege cards.  
- After **even-numbered rounds**, shuffle the discard into a new draw pile.  
- Refill face-up Privilege cards to 5.  
- Move Round marker one space right.  
- Winner of the **5th auction (Maximilian)** becomes next round’s start player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Privilege Tiles (Earned via Nobility/Offices Steps)  
Available only at 3rd and 4th levels:

- **Nobility**:  
  - 3rd (Count): Coat of Arms → earns Prestige each round  
  - 4th (Prince): Letter of Nobility → earns more Prestige each round  

- **Offices**:  
  - 3rd (Councilor): Minter → draw 1 extra Debt card for free each Income phase  
  - 4th (Mayor): Master Builder OR Minter → choose one; Master Builder allows building Church/Cathedral as free action  

> When taking a privilege, player may choose to take the tile instead of advancing a step.

#### Building Churches & Cathedrals  
- Can only be built via the **"Build" option** on a Privilege card (Purple/Scroll).  
- Must pay listed cost.  
- May build **only one Church and one Cathedral total**.  
- Building a Cathedral does **not** remove need for a Church.  
- **Prerequisite for high scoring**:  
  - >25 points → must have Church  
  - >45 points → must have Cathedral  

#### Maximilian Auction Special Rule  
- During the 5th (Maximilian) auction:  
  - Players may use **any combination** of noble cards (not just Maximilian)  
  - Must include **at least one non-Joker card**  
  - Jokers allowed freely  

- **Tiebreaker for highest card**:  
  Nobles ranked right to left:  
  **Red < Yellow < Blue < Green < Maria (highest)**  
  (Note: Philip is lowest, Maximilian/Maria is highest)

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when Round marker moves past the final space (after $ n + 2 $ rounds).  
- Final scoring: Total all Prestige points.  
- **Winner**: Highest total.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Most expensive **Cathedral**  
  2. Most expensive **Church**  

> Churches and Cathedrals have different costs; higher cost breaks ties.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I exceed 25 points without a Church?**  
  No. Never allowed. Must build Church before scoring beyond 25.

- **Can I build more than one Church or Cathedral?**  
  No. Maximum one of each.

- **What happens if I lose a step tile to another player?**  
  You keep any privilege tiles earned from it. Only the step tile is lost.

- **Do I get paid for privilege tiles every round?**  
  Yes. Coat of Arms, Letter of Nobility, and Minter provide ongoing benefits.

- **Can I use a privilege tile immediately after earning it?**  
  Yes, starting in the next Income phase.

- **If only two players bid, do 2nd/3rd place payouts apply?**  
  Only if at least three players matched the bid. Otherwise, lower payouts are skipped.

- **Can I use a privilege to build and also use Builder action in same turn?**  
  No. The Builder allows **one** free build as part of executing two actions. Cannot build twice.

- **Can I take a privilege tile instead of stepping up?**  
  Yes — when using a privilege card, you may choose to take the privilege for your current level instead of advancing.
