### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On a turn, a player performs the following steps in order:

#### A. Roll and Move  
- Roll the die.  
- Move the truck **exactly** the number rolled, in any direction.  
- **Must move full distance**, unless:  
  - Reaches start/destination city of a contract (may stop early).  
  - Lands on or passes a **road construction** or **traffic jam** marker (must stop).  
  - Rolls a **6**: may choose to move **1–6 spaces** (player’s choice).  

> **Note**: Only **one truck per highway space** (except city spaces, which allow multiple). Trucks may pass through occupied city spaces.

#### B. Event Space  
- If the player **ends movement** on a red/white triangle (event space):  
  - Draw the top event card.  
  - Resolve its effect immediately.  
  - Discard the card (remove from game).  

> **If unable to pay an event cost**: Place the card face-up in front of you. Pay **double the amount** later to remove it. Until paid, the card remains active.

#### C. Road Construction  
- If player rolls a **1** (or uses a 6 as 1):  
  - Move **1 space**.  
  - Then place or move the **road construction** marker to **any unoccupied highway space** (not a city, not occupied, not Hamburg–Flensburg).  
  - The blocked space becomes impassable.  

#### D. Contracts  
##### Private Contracts  
- To **initiate**: End movement in the **start city** of a private contract.  
  - May ignore excess movement.  
  - Load the specified number of goods from storage.  
  - Place contract card face-up in front of you.  
- To **complete**: End movement in the **destination city** (excess movement may be ignored).  
  - Return goods to storage.  
  - Collect payment from the bank.  
  - Discard the contract card.  

> A truck can carry **6 goods** by default. Must have **full capacity** to load a contract.  

##### Public Contracts  
- To trigger auction: End movement in **any city** by **exact count** (no excess movement).  
- Player may select one of the **4 face-up public contracts** to auction.  
  - If no one else bids, gets it **for free**.  
  - Otherwise, open auction:  
    - Bidding proceeds clockwise, starting with player to the left.  
    - Bids must match one of the 5 levels printed on the card (1–5 under "Kosten").  
    - The **initiating player has advantage**: can **match** the highest bid instead of raising it.  
  - Winner pays cost immediately (no credit).  
  - Winner takes contract into hand.  
  - Draw a new public contract to refill the space.  

> If player stops in a city by exact count but **does not want** a public contract, remove the **leftmost** public contract, slide others left, and draw a new one. This helps end the game.

#### E. Trailers  
- At any time during your turn, you may **buy** trailers:  
  - Small trailer: +4 capacity, costs **2,000 DM/€**  
  - Large trailer: +6 capacity, costs **3,000 DM/€**  
- Trailers are **permanent** (kept until game end).  
- You may buy **multiple trailers**.
