## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Family Business*, players lead rival mob families in a ruthless struggle for dominance. The goal is to eliminate all other families and be the last player with any mobsters remaining. Victory comes through cunning use of attack, rescue, and counter cards to orchestrate hits, avoid elimination, and survive the escalating violence of Mob Wars.

### 2. Components  
- **54 Mobster cards**: 6 families (by color), 9 mobsters each.  
- **56–58 Action cards** (varies by edition), divided into:  
  - **Attack cards** (red gun/tommy gun icon): Used to target mobsters.  
  - **Rescue cards** (green cross/badge icon): Used to protect or remove mobsters from danger.  
  - **Counter cards** (blue arrows/crossed pistols icon): Played out of turn to block specific cards.  
- Game box: Used during play — lid as "the wall," bottom as discard tray.

### 3. Setup  
- Each player chooses one mob family and places all 9 mobster cards face-up in front of them. Unused families are set aside.  
- Shuffle the Action cards and deal 5 to each player.  
- Place the remaining Action cards face-down in the center as the draw deck.  
- Form "the wall" by stacking the box bottom on the box lid; use one short side to line up mobsters on the Hit List.  
- The dealer goes first. Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, follow these steps in order:  
1. **Draw 1 card** from the draw deck (you now have 6 cards temporarily).  
2. **Play or discard 1 card** face-up to the discard pile.  
   - You may play an **Attack** or **Rescue** card for its effect.  
   - You may discard a card with no effect by announcing "discard."  
3. **Resolve card effects immediately.**  
4. **Counter cards** may be played **out of turn** in response to specific actions (see Core Mechanics).  
5. **Mob War resolution** occurs at the **beginning of each player’s turn** if active (see below).  
6. After your turn, all players should have 5 cards in hand (replenished via draw or Counter resolution).

**Turn Order Exception**:  
If a player plays a **Counter card**, they take the next turn immediately, skipping intervening players.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Hit List  
- Mobsters targeted for elimination are placed face-up in a line next to "the wall."  
- The mobster **closest to the box** is executed first (the "front" of the list).  
- New mobsters are added to the **end** of the list unless specified otherwise (e.g., Priority Contract).

#### Mob War  
A Mob War begins under any of these conditions:  
- Playing a **Mob War**, **Vendetta**, or **Ambush** card.  
- **6 or more mobsters** on the Hit List.  
- **6 or fewer mobsters** remaining in play (across all players).  

**During a Mob War**:  
- At the **beginning of each player’s turn**, execute mobster(s) from the front of the Hit List:  
  - **Normal rate**: 1 mobster per turn (triggered by Mob War card or list size).  
  - **Double rate**: 2 mobsters per turn (triggered by **Vendetta** or **Ambush**).  
- Flip executed mobsters to their RIP side and place them in the box bottom.  
- A Mob War ends when:  
  - The Hit List is empty.  
  - A **Truce** card is played.  
  - A **Federal Crackdown** removes all mobsters from the Hit List.  
- If triggering conditions persist after ending, a Mob War **immediately restarts**.

#### Card Types & Effects  

**Attack Cards (Red Gun Icon)**  
- **Contract**: Target player places one of their mobsters on the Hit List (end).  
- **Priority Contract**: Same as Contract, but mobster is placed **at the front** of the Hit List.  
- **Double Contract**: Target player places **two** of their mobsters on the Hit List.  
- **Hit**: Immediately execute **any one mobster** (in play or on Hit List). Then, place **one of your own** mobsters on the Hit List.  
- **St. Valentine’s Day Massacre**: Immediately execute **all mobsters** on the Hit List.  
- **Double Cross**: Take **one mobster from each opponent** and add them to the Hit List in any order.  
- **Mob War**: Start (or restart) a Mob War at **normal rate** (1 execution per turn).  
- **Ambush**: Start (or double the rate of) a Mob War — **2 executions per turn**.  
- **Vendetta**: Take **two mobsters from each opponent** and add them to the Hit List in any order. Start (or continue) a Mob War at **double rate**.  
- **Turncoat**: Swap a living mobster from the player with the **most mobsters** with a dead one (from discard pile) belonging to the player with the **fewest mobsters**. In case of ties, active player chooses. Returned mobster goes to same Hit List position or in front of player if original was not on list. Cannot revive eliminated players.

**Rescue Cards (Green Cross Icon)**  
- **Take It on the Lam**: Remove **one mobster** from the Hit List.  
  - Can be countered by **Finger**.  
- **Police Protection**: Remove **one mobster** from the Hit List.  
- **Substitution**: Replace one mobster on the Hit List with **any other mobster in play** (including another on the list).  
- **Intrigue**: **Rearrange the order** of the Hit List. No additions or removals.  
- **Truce**: Immediately **end a Mob War**.  
- **Pay Off**: Remove **all of one player’s mobsters** from the Hit List.  
- **Federal Crackdown**: Return **all mobsters on the Hit List** to their owners (back in play).

**Counter Cards (Blue Arrows Icon)**  
May be played **out of turn** in response to specific cards. Only one Counter may be played per action (first one wins).  
After resolution, the Counter player:  
- Draws a replacement card.  
- Takes the next turn.  

| Counter Card | Blocks | Effect |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| **Family Influence** | Contract, Priority Contract, 1 mobster of Double Contract | Cancels the targeting; no mobster added. |
| **Mob Power** | Contract, Priority Contract, 1 mobster of Double Contract | Reverses effect: **Contract player** must place one of their own mobsters on the Hit List instead. |
| **Finger** | Take It on the Lam | Cancels the rescue; mobster remains on the Hit List. |
| **Safe House** | Vendetta (for one player) | Prevents your mobsters from being added to the Hit List by Vendetta. **Mob War still starts.** |

**Counter Exceptions**:  
Some Attack cards specify "No Family Influence" or "No Counters," meaning only allowed counters apply.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **No scoring** — the game is won by elimination.  
- A player is **eliminated** when their **last mobster is killed**.  
  - Their remaining Action cards are discarded immediately.  
- The game ends when **only one player has any mobsters left** (in play or on the Hit List).  
- That player **wins**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a Counter card on a Rescue card?**  
  Yes — **Finger** counters **Take It on the Lam**.  
- **Can multiple players Counter the same card?**  
  No — only the **first** Counter played takes effect.  
- **What happens if a Mob War ends but conditions persist?**  
  A new Mob War starts **immediately** at normal rate (1 per turn).  
- **Can I use Substitution to save a mobster about to be executed?**  
  Yes — if played **before** the execution phase (e.g., during your turn or via Counter timing).  
- **Does Truce stop ongoing Mob War executions?**  
  Yes — executions stop **immediately**.  
- **Can a player with no mobsters in play but one on the Hit List still play cards?**  
  Yes — as long as they have Action cards, they continue playing until their mobster is executed.  
- **Can Turncoat bring back an eliminated player?**  
  No — the returned mobster must go to a player **still in the game** (i.e., with at least one mobster alive).
