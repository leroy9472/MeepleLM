### 1. Lore & Objective
Risk Godstorm is a mythological variant of the classic Risk game, set in a reimagined ancient world where players control one of five Factions (Babylonians, Celts, Egyptians, Greeks, Vikings), each with a pantheon of four gods: Sky, War, Death, and Magic. The objective is to amass the largest empire by the end of the game and earn the most Victory Points through territorial control, continent dominance, and strategic use of divine powers.

### 2. Components
- **Maps**:  
  - *Ancient Earth Map*: Main battlefield with 42 territories grouped into 6 continents.  
  - *Underworld Map*: Secondary battlefield for resurrected armies, featuring 4 Crypts, 2 Altars, and 3 Gates.
- **Faction Pieces**:  
  - *Gods*: 4 per faction (Sky, War, Death, Magic).  
  - *Armies*: Infantry (1 army) and War Elephants (5 armies).  
  - *Temples*: 12 total; generate armies and faith.
- **Tokens & Markers**:  
  - Faith Tokens (1s and 5s).  
  - Plague Tokens (4 standard + 1 extra).  
  - Turn Order Tokens (numbered 1–5).  
  - Epoch Marker.  
  - Atlantis Lost Marker.  
  - Maelstrom (blocks sea routes).
- **Cards**:  
  - Territory Deck (42 cards, 2 wilds removed).  
  - Miracle Decks: War (17), Death (17), Sky (17), Magic/Relics (15).  
- **Dice**: 10 six-sided dice (5 black, 5 white).

### 3. Setup
1. **Choose Factions**: Players roll dice; highest roller picks first. Each selects a Pantheon and places gods on it.
2. **Determine Plague Territories**: Reveal top 4 Territory cards; place Plague Tokens on those territories. Return cards and reshuffle.
3. **Populate the Map**:
   - *Army Allocation*:  
     - 5 players: 25 armies  
     - 4 players: 30 armies  
     - 3 players: 35 armies  
     - 2 players: 30 armies (with neutral faction)  
   - *Territory Assignment*: Random deal or round-robin placement until all 42 territories have 1 army.
   - *Place Remaining Armies*: Players take turns placing up to 3 armies at a time on their territories.
   - *Place War Gods & Temples*: Each player places their War god and one Temple on any territory they control.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each Epoch consists of all players taking a turn in order. A player turn has 10 steps:
1. Raise Armies & Collect Faith  
2. Summon Gods and Build Temples  
3. Obtain Miracle Cards  
4. Play Miracle Cards (War/Death)  
5. Suffer Plague  
6. Invade an Ancient Earth Territory  
7. Fortify a Position  
8. Embark from Heaven (to Underworld)  
9. Invade Underworld  
10. End Turn  

After all players complete their turns, advance the Epoch Marker. Game ends after 5 Epochs (or 6 if "Time Stands Still" is played).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Raising Armies & Faith**:  
  - Base: Territories controlled ÷ 3 (rounded down, minimum 3).  
  - Continent Bonuses: Vary by continent (e.g., Europa: +7 Armies, +7 Faith).  
  - Temples: +1 Army and +1 Faith each.  
  - Crypt Resurrection: For each Crypt with ≥2 armies, resurrect 1 army to a Temple-controlled territory.
- **Summoning Gods**: 3 Faith to summon a god from Pantheon to a controlled territory.
- **Building Temples**: 5 Faith; one per territory.
- **Obtaining Miracle Cards**: 2 Faith per card if corresponding god is in play; max 4 per turn. Cards remain secret until played.
- **Free Miracle Cards**: Earn by completing god’s Labor:  
  - War: Conquer 3 territories in one turn.  
  - Death: Control a Crypt at end of turn.  
  - Sky: Win a Godswar.  
  - Magic: Roll three-of-a-kind in a Godswar.
- **Godswar**: Occurs when gods are on both sides of an invasion. Each side rolls 3 dice + army count + modifiers. Winner banishes losing god. Modifiers:  
  - Sky God: +1 die.  
  - Magic God: Re-roll 1s.  
  - War God: Attacker wins ties.  
  - Temple: Defender re-rolls 1s.  
  - Altar: +1 die per Altar controlled.
- **Normal Combat**: After Godswar (if any). Attacker rolls up to 3 dice (min 2 armies required). Defender rolls up to 2 dice (min 1 army). Highest dice compared; defender wins ties unless War god attacks.
- **Plague**:  
  - Armies: Half destroyed (rounded down) when ending turn in Plague territory.  
  - Gods: Banished if in Plague territory at end of turn.  
  - No effect during fortification.
- **Underworld**:  
  - Armies lost in combat (unless Death god involved) go to Heaven.  
  - Embark via Gates or directly to controlled spaces.  
  - Invade for control of Crypts (VP, resurrection) and Altars (+1 die in Godswar).  
  - No gods or Miracle Cards allowed.
- **Victory Points**:  
  - 1 per territory controlled.  
  - Continent bonuses converted to VP.  
  - 1 per Altar or Crypt controlled.  
  - Relics: Some grant VP if controlling named territory.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Game ends after Epoch 5 (or 6). Victory Points calculated as:
- Territories: 1 each.
- Continents: Bonus value.
- Underworld: 1 VP per Altar/Crypt.
- Relics: Some grant VP for controlling specific territory.

**Tiebreakers**:  
1. Most Faith Tokens.  
2. Most Temples.  
3. Most Gods in play.  
4. Most Armies on Ancient Earth.  
5. Co-champions.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Plague & Neutral Armies (2-player)**: Neutral armies not halved by Plague.  
- **Miracle Card Timing**: War/Death cards played only in Step 4; Sky cards played when attacked; Relics played immediately upon acquisition.  
- **Pandora’s Box**: Allows drawing Death cards without Death god; must wait to play until god is summoned.  
- **Three 1s in Godswar**: Triggers Magic relic; re-roll allowed in same combat.  
- **Ties in Army Halving**: Always round down.  
- **Siren’s Call into Plague**: Armies halved, gods banished immediately.  
- **Continent Destruction (e.g., Atlantis sunk)**: Re-roll if affected by card.
