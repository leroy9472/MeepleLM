## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Goldbrau*, players compete over three weeks to earn the most money by investing in breweries and beer gardens in a bustling Bavarian town. Through strategic share acquisition, boss takeovers, and expansion of beer gardens, players aim to maximize income during weekly payday payouts. Special tokens — the "Pretty Waitress" and the "Drunken Bum" — provide large bonuses or penalties depending on their location. The player with the most thalers after the third payday wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board in the center. Position 3 fences directly in front of each of the 6 beer gardens to define initial spaces.  
2. Each player receives:  
   - 25 thalers  
   - 16 share cubes (18 if 3 players)  
   - 6 boss figures  
   - 3 action cards  
3. Shuffle the 12 brewery signs face down. Draw 1 and place it in the "Beer Stein" beer garden. Continue clockwise, placing one sign in each beer garden. Place the remaining 6 signs at their matching breweries (corners).  
4. Place the "Pretty Waitress" token in "Bear Garden" and the "Drunken Bum" in "Eagle Garden."  
5. Shuffle the 60 share cards plus 5 "Pretty Waitress" and 5 "Drunken Bum" cards (70 total). Deal 6 cards to each player (8 if 3 players).  
6. Each player selects 4 of their dealt cards (6 if 3 players), reveals them, and places 1 share cube on the corresponding beer garden or brewery. Discard the revealed cards.  
7. Players take turns placing 2 boss figures (3 if 3 players), one at a time, on businesses without a boss. Only one boss per business.  
8. Choose a starting player ("thirstiest"). That player takes the Starting Player figure. The player two seats clockwise takes the Payday figure.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Beer Garden Expansion  
- You may expand any beer garden where you are the boss by adding one adjacent (non-diagonal) unused space.  
- Umbrella spaces (marked) earn double income and may be expanded into at no extra cost.  
- If you are the boss of two **adjacent** beer gardens, you may transfer one table (space) from one to the other.  
  - You cannot transfer the starting space.  
  - If the transfer splits a beer garden, the section not connected to the starting space is lost.  
- **Bonus**: If only one player selects this action, they may perform it **twice**.

#### Name Boss / Beer Contract  
- **Takeover Attempt**:  
  - You may place your boss marker in a business (brewery or beer garden) where you have at least one share.  
  - You may first play a matching share card from your hand to place a cube, then attempt takeover.  
  - The current boss may block if they have an **absolute majority** (more shares than all others combined).  
    - The current boss may also play a share card to add a cube and strengthen their claim.  
  - If takeover fails, you may continue trying in future rounds.  
  - **You cannot challenge a boss who was just placed this round.**  
- **Beer Contract Change**:  
  - If you are boss of both a brewery and a beer garden, you may change the beer contract:  
    - Remove the current brewery sign from the beer garden and return it to its brewery.  
    - Place your brewery's sign on the beer garden.  
- **Bonus**: If only one player selects this action, they may do it **twice** (e.g., take over a business and change a contract).

#### Acquire Share  
- Each player may buy **exactly one** share.  
- Cost depends on number of players choosing this action:  
  - 1 player: 2 thalers each  
  - 2 players: 5 thalers each  
  - 3 or 4 players: 8 thalers each  
- Purchase options:  
  - Buy a **face-up** share: Must immediately place a cube on the corresponding business. Discard the card.  
  - Buy the **top card of the deck**: May place a cube immediately or hold the card in hand.  
- **Special Cards**:  
  - "Pretty Waitress" or "Drunken Bum" cards **must be revealed immediately** when purchased.  
  - The matching token may be:  
    - Left in place, or  
    - Moved 1 or 2 beer gardens away (clockwise), **not counting** any beer garden occupied by the other token.  
  - **Both tokens cannot occupy the same beer garden.**  
- **Share Limit Rule**:  
  - When the **6th cube** is placed in any business, all **single-share holdings** are removed and returned to their owners (no compensation).  
  - Players keep any holdings of 2 or more shares.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Payday (Sunday Evening)  
After 7 rounds, scoring occurs:

1. **Final Share Play**: Before income, players may play share cards from hand to place cubes (convert to ownership).  
2. **Income Distribution**:  
   a. **Beer Garden Income**:  
      - Regular space: 4 thalers  
      - Umbrella space: 8 thalers  
      - Total income is split:  
        - Half goes to the **brewery supplying the beer** (per beer contract)  
        - Half is distributed to **beer garden shareholders** proportionally  
        - **Remainders** go to the **boss** of the beer garden  
   b. **Brewery Income**:  
      - Income from all beer gardens supplied by the brewery is summed.  
      - Divided among **brewery shareholders** (and boss) proportionally.  
      - Remainders go to the boss.  
   c. **Special Tokens**:  
      - "Pretty Waitress" in a beer garden: +20 thalers to its **boss**  
      - "Drunken Bum" in a beer garden: –12 thalers from its **boss** (cannot go below 0)  

3. **Order of Scoring**:  
   - Start with "Beer Stein" and continue clockwise.  
   - Resolve each beer garden and its linked brewery income.  

#### End of Game  
- After the **third payday** (end of Week 3), the game ends.  
- The player with the **most thalers** wins.  
- In case of a tie, the player with the most shares wins. If still tied, tied players share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I expand into a space already claimed by another beer garden?**  
  No. Expansion only into unclaimed or umbrella spaces adjacent to your beer garden.  

- **Can I transfer a table between non-adjacent beer gardens?**  
  No. Only between **adjacent** beer gardens where you are boss of both.  

- **What happens if a beer garden is split during transfer?**  
  The part not connected to the starting space is **lost** (all cubes and ownership removed).  

- **Can I play a "Pretty Waitress" card from my hand during a takeover?**  
  No. These cards must be played **immediately when drawn or purchased**. You cannot hold them.  

- **Can I move the "Drunken Bum" past the "Pretty Waitress" during movement?**  
  Yes. You may "jump over" the occupied beer garden; it is not counted in movement.  

- **Can I be boss of multiple businesses?**  
  Yes. One boss per business, but you may be boss of multiple.  

- **What happens if no one selects an action?**  
  That action is skipped. Bonuses only trigger if exactly one player selects the action.  

- **Can I place a boss and change a contract in the same turn using the bonus?**  
  Yes. If you are the only one to select "Name Boss / Beer Contract," you may:  
  1. Take over a business  
  2. Change a beer contract (even using the business you just took over)
