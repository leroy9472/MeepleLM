## Fürstenfeld – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Fürstenfeld*, players take on the role of nobles seeking to build their own palace by collecting wealth and resources. The goal is to be the first to complete all six parts of your palace and, among those who do, have the most money to claim victory—symbolizing a life of luxury funded by taxation rather than labor.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Main board  
- Palace price cards (numbered 8 to 18)  
- Wood cubes (1 per player)  
- Demand cards (7 total; 1–5 used depending on player count)  
- Goods: hops (green), barley (yellow), water (blue)  
- Money: silver (1), yellow (5)  
- Income track with colored player markers  
- Player boards (1 per player)  
- Summary cards (1 per player)  
- Building/field cards (26 or 28 per player, depending on game mode)  
- Colored disks (player markers)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the main board in the center.  
2. Sort palace price cards from 8 (top) to 18 (bottom) and place them on the matching board spaces.  
3. Place 1 wood cube per player beside the palace price cards; remove excess.  
4. Randomly select 1 demand card per player from the 7 available and place each on a brewery demand space. Unused breweries are ignored.  
5. Stock money and goods on their designated supply spaces.  
6. For each active brewery, place 1 hop, barley, or water token on the "1" price space marked with a white outline.  
7. Stack all player markers on the "0" space of the left income track in random order.  
8. Give each player:  
   - 1 Fürstenfeld player board  
   - 1 summary card  
   - 2 silver (1-value) coins  
9. Card setup (choose one):  
   - **Base Game**: Give each player a deck of 26 building/field cards (exclude tour guide and scavenger). Shuffle, place facedown, draw 3.  
   - **Expert Game**: Give each player a deck of 28 building/field cards. Shuffle, draw 10, keep 1, and place the other 9 facedown at the bottom of the deck in any order.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of six phases. The game ends when any player completes their 6th palace card, at the end of that round.

**Phases 1–2**: May be done simultaneously by all players.  
**Phases 3–5**: Proceed in player order (lowest to highest income; ties broken top to bottom in stack). Players may act early but must respect order effects (e.g., brewery access, income stacking, palace price increases).  
**Phase 6**: Automatic market adjustment.

#### Phase 1: Draw Cards  
- Draw 3 cards.  
- Laboratory I/II allows drawing 1 or 2 extra cards (optional).  
  - Base Game: Hand size is 6 in round 1, 4 in subsequent rounds (before labs).  
  - Expert Game: No hand limit unless modified by town hall.

#### Phase 2: Harvest Goods  
- Place 1 matching good (hops, barley, water) from supply onto each field space on your board or cards that produces goods.  
- Use any suitable tokens if components are limited.

#### Phase 3: Sell Goods  
- Choose **one** brewery to sell to.  
- Sell any number of goods at current prices shown above the brewery.  
- Place each good:  
  - In an empty colored space (1 good per space), OR  
  - In the uncolored surplus space (stackable).  
- **Cannot sell** a good if its price is 0 (even with Office).  
- Collect income based on current price markers.  
- After income:  
  - For each good in surplus, move its price marker down 1 space.  
  - Return surplus goods to supply.  
  - Colored-space goods remain.  
- Collect additional income from active Bank I (3) and Bank II (5) cards.  
- **Mark Income**:  
  - Move your marker to the corresponding space on the **alternate** income track (left/right alternates each round).  
  - Stack markers if income ties; later players go on top.  
  - Cap at 25 (marker goes on "25" if income exceeds it).  
- *Tip*: You may under-sell to gain better player order.

#### Phase 4: Build  
You may build up to 2 cards this phase.  
- **Regular buildings/fields**: Pay cost shown (top left).  
- **Palace cards**: Pay the price shown on the current palace price card.  
  - After payment, place 1 wood cube from supply onto the palace price card.  
  - If the card now has cubes equal to player count:  
    - Remove all cubes.  
    - Place the current palace card under its deck.  
    - Reveal next card (price increases by 2).  
- You may build over any card except an already-built palace. Covered cards are inactive.  
- You may build over a card built this same turn.  
- Newly built cards are active immediately (can be used this turn).  
- **Expert Game Only**: Palace cards I–III must be built left to right in top row; IV–VI left to right in bottom row.

#### Phase 5: Discard  
- Discard all but 1 card from hand (unless modified by Town Hall I/II: keep 1 or 2 extra).  
- Place discarded cards facedown at the bottom of your deck in any order.  
- Discard all goods (unless protected by Warehouse: store up to 3).  
- Goods stored in Warehouse may be discarded later to make room.

#### Phase 6: Adjust Market Price  
- For each **empty colored space** on brewery demand cards, move the corresponding price marker **up 1 space**.  
- Return all goods from brewery demand cards to their supply.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Income Tracks**: Alternate left/right each round to distinguish players who have sold.  
- **Player Order**: Determined by current income (low to high), then stack order.  
- **Palace Price Escalation**: Each palace card fills after being paid for by all players; price increases by 2 each time.  
- **Building Flexibility**: Can build over cards (except palaces); double-build allowed.  
- **Card Effects**:  
  - **Office**: Choose 1 good type per round; gain +1 coin per unit sold.  
  - **Market**: Sell up to 3 goods as if they were another type.  
  - **Magistrate**: Place income marker 3 spaces lower than actual income.  
  - **Building Crane**: All buildings cost 2 less. Also trash up to 2 cards from hand in Phase 5.  
  - **Tour Guide**: Gain 2 coins per built palace card during Phase 3 (expert game only, as it's excluded in base).  
  - **Laboratory I/II**: Draw +1 or +2 cards in Phase 1 (optional).  
  - **Town Hall I/II**: Keep 1 or 2 extra cards in Phase 5.  
  - **Warehouse**: Store up to 3 goods between rounds.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends at the end of the round in which **any player builds their 6th palace card**.  
- Among players who have built all 6 palace parts, the one with the **most money wins**.  
- If tied, no tiebreaker is specified—presumed to be a shared win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I sell zero goods?** Yes. You still collect bank income and mark your position.  
- **Can I use Market and Office together?** Yes. Use Market to reassign good type, then apply Office bonus if applicable.  
- **Does Building Crane reduce palace cost?** Yes. Palace cost is reduced by 2 when using Crane.  
- **Can I stack income markers beyond 25?** No. All markers at or above 25 go on the 25 space.  
- **What if a price marker can’t move down?** It stops at 0.  
- **What if a price marker can’t move up?** It stops at the highest available number.  
- **Can I use Laboratory and still go over hand limit?** Yes—Laboratory allows optional extra draws. Hand limits are enforced only in Phase 5.
