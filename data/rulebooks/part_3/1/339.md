## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Quiddler is a word card game that challenges players to create words using letter cards in hand. The objective is to score the most points over eight hands by forming valid words, earning bonuses, and minimizing unplayed card penalties.

### 2. Components  
- A deck of letter cards with point values printed on them  
- Score sheet for tracking points  
- Optional: dictionary for resolving challenges  

Card Point Values:  
- A:10, B:2, C:2, D:4, E:12, F:2, G:4, H:2, I:8, J:2, K:2, L:4, M:2, N:6, O:8, P:2, Q:2, QU:2, R:6, S:4, T:6, U:6, V:2, W:2, X:2, Y:2, Z:2  
- Special multi-letter cards: IN (2), ER (2), TH (2), CL (2), QU (2)

### 3. Setup  
1. Shuffle the deck thoroughly before each hand.  
2. Deal cards based on the hand number:  
   - Hand 1: 3 cards  
   - Hand 2: 4 cards  
   - Hand 3: 5 cards  
   - Hand 4: 6 cards  
   - Hand 5: 7 cards  
   - Hand 6: 8 cards  
   - Hand 7: 9 cards  
   - Hand 8: 10 cards  
3. Place the remaining cards in the center as the stockpile.  
4. Turn over the top card of the stockpile to begin the discard pile.  
5. Play proceeds clockwise, starting with the player to the left of the dealer.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. On your turn:  
   a. Draw one card — either the top card from the stockpile or the top card from the discard pile.  
   b. Optionally, form words using cards from your hand.  
   c. If you can use all your cards to form valid words and discard one, you may "go out" this turn.  
2. To "go out":  
   - Arrange all cards in your hand into one or more valid words (minimum 2 cards per word).  
   - Discard one card after laying down your words.  
   - Announce that you are going out.  
3. Once a player goes out:  
   - All other players get one final turn to form words.  
4. After final turns:  
   - Players reveal their words or unplayed cards.  
   - Scoring occurs.  
5. Deal passes to the left. The next hand is dealt (increasing by one card per hand until Hand 8).  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Words**:  
  - Must consist of 2 or more cards.  
  - All words must be valid English words.  
  - Not allowed: proper nouns, prefixes, suffixes, abbreviations, hyphenated words.  
- **Challenges**:  
  - Any word may be challenged by another player.  
  - Resolution methods:  
    - Use a pre-agreed dictionary (preferred).  
    - If no dictionary:  
      1. The challenged player defends with a sentence using the word.  
      2. All players vote (thumbs up/down).  
      3. Majority rules; ties favor the challenged player.  
  - Consequences:  
    - If the word is rejected: challenged player loses their turn, and the point value of all their played cards is subtracted from their score.  
    - If the challenger wins: challenger gains bonus equal to the point value subtracted.  
- **Bonuses (per hand)**:  
  - **Most Words**: 10 points to the player who forms the highest number of words (only if strictly more than others).  
  - **Longest Word**: 10 points to the player with the word containing the most letters (not cards — e.g., "QU" counts as two letters).  
  - If there is a tie for either category, no bonus is awarded.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Scoring per hand**:  
  - Add point values of all cards used in valid words.  
  - Subtract point values of any unused cards.  
  - Apply bonuses if eligible (10 points each for most words and longest word).  
  - Record total for the hand.  
- **Game end**:  
  - The game ends after the 8th hand (10 cards dealt).  
  - The player with the highest total score wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I lay down words before going out?**  
  No. All words must be revealed at once when you go out.  
- **Can I use multi-letter cards like QU or IN in different parts of words?**  
  Yes, but only as a unit. For example, "QU" must be used together as a single card representing "QU". You cannot split it into Q and U.  
- **What happens if the stockpile runs out?**  
  Reshuffle the discard pile (except the top card) to form a new stockpile.  
- **Can I challenge my own word?**  
  No. Only other players can challenge.  
- **Do bonuses stack?**  
  Yes. A player can earn both Most Words and Longest Word bonuses in the same hand if eligible.
