### 3. Setup  
1. Unfold the game board and place it flat.  
2. Each player receives:
   - 3 score/yardage markers (color assigned to team)
   - 1 Play Sequence Card
   - Access to Yardage Dice and Play Dice
3. Assign offense and defense:
   - Offense receives: 3 black Play Dice, 5 white Yardage Dice
   - Defense receives: Run (red), Short Pass (yellow), Long Pass (green) Defense dice, Defense Effect die
4. Place yellow first down marker 10 yards ahead of current line of scrimmage.
5. Choose Game Option (Red Zone Shootout, Backyard Brawl, Smashmouth Full Game, Professional Full Game).
6. Set starting field position and time based on chosen option.
7. Each team starts with 10 tokens for offensive/defensive modifiers (per team card).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each play follows this sequence:

1. **Play Selection**:
   - Offense rolls 3 black Play Dice to determine play type (Run, Short Pass, Long Pass, etc.)
   - Apply solitaire re-roll rules if applicable (e.g., near goal line)
   - Defense selects matching Defense die based on play type

2. **Modifier Application**:
   - Offense may spend tokens to apply +1 or +2 modifier to play roll (before rolling)
   - Defense may claim negative modifiers from opponent’s team card (e.g., if offense runs vs. -1 Run defense, offense loses 1 token)

3. **Roll Yardage**:
   - Roll 5 white Yardage Dice and sum result
   - Apply any modifiers
   - Consult team-specific Offense Plays chart for special results (e.g., fumbles, interceptions)

4. **Defense Effect Roll**:
   - Roll small white Defense Effect die
   - Results may include penalties, turnovers, or special events (e.g., QB Pressure, Mishap)

5. **Resolve Result**:
   - Apply yardage gain/loss
   - Move first down marker accordingly
   - If first down earned, reset down to 1st and reposition marker
   - If turnover or punt, switch possession

6. **Clock Management**:
   - Advance game clock per play (1 unit = 10 seconds)
   - On 4th down, use 4th Down Decision chart to determine AI choice (Punt, FG, Go for it)
   - Apply timeout rules:
     - Offense: call timeout if play starts at 1:10 or later (save for FG if possible)
     - Defense: call timeout when down by 9+ with ≤3:00 left; down ≤8 with ≤2:00 left

7. **End of Drive**:
   - Turnover on downs, punt, score, or half/game ends
   - Reset for next possession or end game

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Play Calling & Dice  
- **Play Dice (3 black)**: Determine play type. Match result to chart (e.g., 2 Runs, 1 Short Pass = Run)
- **Yardage Dice (5 white)**: Sum of dice = yards gained or lost
- **Defense Dice**:
  - Run: red die
  - Short Pass: yellow die
  - Long Pass: green die
- **Defense Effect Die**: Triggers penalties, turnovers, or special events

#### Solitaire Play Calling Rules  
Use d12 when simulating AI offense:
- **Inside opponent’s 5-yard line**:
  - Roll "Short/Long Pass" → re-roll
  - Second roll "Long Pass" → re-roll once more
- **Inside opponent’s 10-yard line**:
  - Roll "Long Pass" → re-roll
- **Inside own 5-yard line**:
  - Roll "Long Pass" → re-roll

#### Hail Mary Pass  
Triggered when:
- Defense leads by 4+ points
- Final play of 2nd or 4th quarter
- Ball outside opponent’s 35-yard line → Long Pass only
- Ball outside opponent’s 25-yard line → d12: 1–5 = Long Pass, 7–12 = Short Pass

#### Team Ratings & Modifiers  
Each team has Offense and Defense ratings (Run, Short Pass, Long Pass, Mishap)  
- **Positive modifiers (+1, +2)**: Spent by team using tokens
- **Negative modifiers (-1, -2)**: Claimed by opponent; cost opponent tokens
- **Token rules**:
  - +1 modifier = 1 token
  - +2 modifier = 2 tokens
  - Tokens are spent permanently
  - In solitaire: player may only use modifiers if AI opponent has spent equivalent tokens

#### Turnover & Recovery  
- **Fumble (e.g., "Lose 1", "Roll - per recoveries chart")**: Roll for yardage loss, then check recovery
- **Interception**: Roll for interception location (e.g., "Roll ⑧", "Roll 10") and return (e.g., "20 + ⑧")
- **Mishap**: Roll gain/loss, then recovery or interception

#### 4th Down Decisions  
On 4th down, roll d6 and consult field position:
- **NP**: Normal Punt
- **SP**: Short Punt
- **FG**: Field Goal Attempt
- **Go**: Go for 1st Down / TD  
(Charts not fully provided; decisions influenced by score, time, and field position)

#### Play Calling Style / Clock Management  
Before plays at key times, roll d6 to determine AI aggression:
- Influenced by time remaining, score differential, field position
- Affects future play calls
- **Timeouts**:
  - Offense: call at 1:10 or later if possible, save one for FG
  - Defense: call when down 9+ with ≤3:00; down ≤8 with ≤2:00
- **Onside Kick**:
  - ≤2:00 left
  - Either: down 9+, OR trailing with ≤2 timeouts
- **2-Point Conversion**:
  - Only in 4th quarter
  - Only when score before attempt is: down 2, down 5, down 10, up 1, up 5

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Touchdown**: 6 points
- **Extra Point**: Kick = 1 point; 2-point conversion = 2 points
- **Field Goal**: 3 points
- **Safety**: 2 points (rare, implied by rules)
- Game ends after 4 quarters (or 2 in shortened versions)
- Team with most points wins
- Tie: optional overtime (not detailed)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What if all tokens are spent?**  
  No more modifiers can be used by that team.

- **Can defense use tokens?**  
  No—only offense uses positive modifiers. Defense benefits from opponent’s negative ratings.

- **What happens on a penalty?**
  - Offense penalty: -5 or -10 yards, replay down
  - Defense penalty: +5 yards, automatic 1st down or replay down

- **Can you attempt a field goal on any down?**  
  Typically on 4th down; use 4th Down Decision chart to determine AI choice.

- **How are interceptions returned?**  
  Roll specified dice (e.g., "20 + ⑧") and move ball accordingly.

- **What does "Roll - per recoveries chart" mean?**  
  Implies a separate recovery chart exists (not provided); likely involves rolling to determine which team recovers fumble.
