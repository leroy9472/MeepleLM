## ALCHEMIST — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Alchemist*, players are rival Adepts competing in the Contest of the Alchemists. Each represents a magical school that prizes a specific ingredient. Players brew unique potions to gain Fame, replicate others’ recipes to earn points and resources, and secretly strive to promote their school’s favored ingredient. The goal is to accumulate the most Fame points through potion creation, copying, endgame ingredient counts, and bonus points for promoting your school’s ingredient.

The game ends when two or fewer ingredient types remain in the reserve. The player with the most Fame points wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds clockwise. On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

#### A. Create a New Potion  
- Select an empty cauldron in the Compendium.  
- Place one of your Seal Stones on the round field of the cauldron.  
- Choose 1–5 ingredients from your reserve and place them on the square fields.  
  - Restrictions:  
    1. Cannot duplicate an existing recipe.  
    2. No single ingredient may appear more than twice.  
    3. Cannot use any ingredient that the potion produces (e.g., if potion produces yellow, no yellow ingredients allowed).  
- Select a Potion Value Tile (1–10) from the supply and place it on the cauldron.  
- Advance your Seal Stone on the Fame Track by the value of the tile.  
- Take the produced ingredients (shown at top of cauldron) from the reserve and add them to your private stock.  
  - If an ingredient is out of supply, you do not receive it.  
- **Note:** You cannot create a potion if you have no Seal Stones left.

#### B. Copy an Existing Potion  
- Choose a potion in the Compendium **not created by you**.  
- Take the exact combination of ingredients from your private reserve.  
- Remove all but one ingredient from the game (not returned to supply).  
- Give one ingredient (of your choice from those used) as tribute to the creator.  
- Score points equal to the potion’s value tile.  
- Advance your Seal Stone on the Fame Track.  
- Take the produced ingredients (shown at top of cauldron) from the reserve and add to your private stock.  
  - If out of supply, you do not receive missing ingredients.

#### C. Take Ingredients  
- Choose **one** of the following:  
  - Take **1 ingredient** of your choice from the ingredient reserve.  
  - OR draw **2 random ingredients** from the Oracle Bag.  
- If the Oracle Bag is empty, you may only take 1 from the reserve.

**Two-Player Variant:** First action for each player **must** be to create a potion of value 5 or higher.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Potion Creation:** Unique recipes only; limited by seal stones (max 5 creations per player).  
- **Recipe Copying:** Enables scoring and resource gain, but requires tribute.  
- **Ingredient Management:** Ingredients are used up in creation/copying (except tribute).  
- **Fame Tracking:** Circular track; passing "0" triggers scoring chip use:  
  - First pass: take 50-point chip.  
  - Second pass: flip to 100-point side.  
- **Oracle Bag:** Source of initial and ongoing randomness; once empty, only reserve draws allowed.  
- **School Ingredient Cards:** Determine endgame bonus based on scarcity of that ingredient.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game ends** at the end of a round when **2 or fewer types** of ingredients remain in the ingredient reserve.

Final scoring:

1. **Leftover Ingredients:**  
   - Reveal all ingredients behind your screen.  
   - Score 1 Fame point per **2 ingredients** (round down).  

2. **School Promotion Bonus:**  
   - Return all ingredients from behind screens to the reserve.  
   - Count remaining quantities of each ingredient **in the reserve only** (exclude Compendium and Oracle Bag).  
   - Rank only ingredients corresponding to active School Ingredient Cards.  
   - Award bonus points based on **lowest count = highest bonus**:
     - 1st (lowest): ? points (exact values not specified in source)  
     - 2nd: ? points  
     - etc.  
     - (Note: Chart referenced but not provided; scoring depends on player count.)  
   - Unused school ingredients (no card in play) are not ranked.

3. **Total Score:**  
   - Sum Fame Track points (including scoring chips), leftover ingredient points, and school bonus.  
   - Highest total wins.  
   - Tie: player with most Fame from track (excluding bonuses) wins. If still tied, shared win.
