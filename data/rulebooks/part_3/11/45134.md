### 3. Setup
1. **For First Game**: Set aside Militia and Objective cards.
2. Each player:
   - Chooses a guild.
   - Takes their 11 guild-specific cards (9 Agents, 1 Location, 1 Relic).
   - Places their **Guild Card** face-up in front of them.
   - Shuffles their 11 cards to form a **Main Deck** (face-down pile to the right of the Guild Card).
   - Leaves space for a **Resource Deck** (discard pile to the left).
3. **Stake Cards**:
   - Shuffle all Stake cards.
   - Create **5 piles (Districts)** of 12 cards each (4 piles in 3-player game).
   - Remaining Stake cards return to the box.
   - Place the **"Ducal Jubilee"** card randomly among the **bottom 5 cards** of the **Neutral District (Free Zone)**.
   - Reveal the top card of each pile.
4. **District Layout**:
   - **2-player**: G1 → G1/G2 → Free Zone → G1/G2 → G2
   - **3-player**: G1/G2 → Free Zone → G2/G3 → G1/G3 → G3
   - **4-player**: G1/G2 → Free Zone → G2/G3 → G3/G4 → G1/G4
5. Randomly choose the **First Player** and give them the **First Player Card**.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round has three phases:

#### Phase 1: Intrigue Phase
- Each player draws 4 cards from their Main Deck.
  - If the deck is empty, shuffle the Resource Deck to form a new Main Deck and continue drawing.
- Players take turns clockwise, each performing **one action** per turn:
  1. **Play Agent Face-Up**: Assign an Agent to any **Enemy or Neutral District**.
  2. **Play Agent Face-Down**: Assign an Agent to one of your **Friendly Districts**.
  3. **Play a Location Card**: Resolve its effect, then send it to your Resource Deck.
  4. **Use a Relic to Bribe a Personality**: Attach a Relic to one of your Agents in the same District as a Personality Stake.
  5. **Discard a Card**: Send any card from your hand to your Resource Deck with no effect.
- Turns continue until all players have played or discarded all 4 cards.

#### Phase 2: Resolution Phase
- Resolve each District **in an order chosen by the First Player**.
- For each Stake card:
  - Identify its **Main Arcanum** (gold number: Staff, Sword, Cup, or Ducat).
  - Each player sums the **matching Arcanum value** of their Agents in that District.
  - **Winning Conditions**:
    - If **one player’s total ≥ Main Arcanum**, they win the Stake.
    - If **multiple players ≥ Main Arcanum**, the **highest total wins**.
    - If **all totals < Main Arcanum**, no one wins.
    - **Tie for highest total**: Stake remains; Agents stay in place (unless a Guild ability breaks the tie).
  - **Special Cases**:
    - **Relic Bribe**: If a player uses a Relic on an Agent to meet or exceed a Personality’s Ducat value, they **immediately win** the Stake.
    - **Harlequin**: Each player chooses which Arcanum to use; highest total wins (minimum 2 for Penthow).
- Winner places the Stake card in their **Resource Deck**.
- All Agents and Relics used in the District go to their owners’ **Resource Decks**.

#### Phase 3: End of Round
- Flip the top card of any District with no face-up Stake.
- Pass the **First Player Card** clockwise.
- Begin next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Arcana of Power
- **Military (Stave)** – Yellow icon
- **Political (Sword)** – Yellow icon
- **Spiritual (Cup)** – Yellow icon
- **Financial (Ducat)** – Yellow icon
- **Main Arcanum**: The **gold number** on a Stake card determines which Arcanum is used for contesting it.

#### Card Types
- **Agents**:
  - Played to Districts to contest Stakes.
  - Have values in Stave, Sword, and Cup.
- **Personalities**:
  - Stake cards with a Ducat value.
  - Once won, go to Resource Deck and count as **Agents**.
  - Cannot be bribed if Ducat value is “–” (e.g., Harlequin).
- **Locations**:
  - Played from hand for **immediate effect**, then discarded.
  - Cannot be used to contest Stakes.
- **Relics**:
  - Used to **bribe Personalities**.
  - Played on your Agent; Ducat value adds to Agent’s matching Arcanum.
  - Can be used on **face-down Agents** (revealed when played).
  - Cannot bribe Relics or Locations.
- **Militia (Advanced)**:
  - Discard a Stake card to draw a Militia card and play it as an Agent.
  - Return to Militia Deck after resolution.
- **Objectives (Advanced)**:
  - Each player gets 4, keeps 2.
  - Score VPs at game end if requirements met.

#### Tactical Removal (Optional)
- When winning a Stake, player may:
  - Add it to **Resource Deck** (normal), or
  - Place it **under Guild Card** to remove from deck cycle.
- Counts toward final score.

#### Guild Abilities (Tie-Breaking)
- **Blades**: Win ties on **Military (Stave)** Stakes.
- **Ferrymen**: Win ties on **Political (Sword)** Stakes.
- **Thieves**: Win ties on **Relic** Stakes.
- **Usurers**: Win ties on **Personality** Stakes.
- If multiple players have tie-breaking abilities, they **cancel out**; Stake remains contested.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
