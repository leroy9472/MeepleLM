## II Principe — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
*Note: No lore provided in source.*

---

- Money tokens or currency  
- Building cards (in multiple colors)

- Role tiles (Major and Minor types)  
- Shield tokens (used with completed cities)  
- Game board with color-coded regions  

*(Exact quantities not specified in source.)*

---

### 3. Setup  
**Phase 1 – Initial Setup**  
Each player:  
1. Takes 5 Money.  
2. Draws 4 Building cards into hand.  
3. Places any 2 of those Building cards face down into a shared stack.  
   - All players contribute to the same stack (one communal pile of 2×player count face-down cards).

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in recurring phases:

#### Phase 1: Draw and Contribute  
- Each player:  
  - Takes 5 Money.  
  - Draws 4 Building cards into hand.  
  - Selects 2 Building cards from hand and places them face down into the shared stack.  

> **End Condition Check**: If fewer than 4 City cards remain at the start of this phase, the game ends immediately.

#### Phase 2: Reveal, Group, and Auction  
1. Reveal all face-down Building cards from the shared stack.  
2. Group revealed cards by color.  
3. Auction off each color group one at a time:  
   - Auction groups with the fewest cards first.  
   - Tiebreaker order: Green (G), White (W), Red (R), Blue (B), Yellow (Y).  
4. After all auctions, player may **build one City** during this phase (follow Phase 3 City build rules).

#### Phase 3: Action – Build City OR Play Cards  
On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

**Option A: Build a City**  
- Play Building cards from hand that match the requirements of a City card.  
- Pay the monetary cost listed on the City card.  
- Collect the VP indicated on the City card.  
- Place Shield token(s) adjacent to the completed City:  
  - Small City → 1 Shield  
  - Large City → 2 Shields (can be split across adjacent regions)  
- **Other players** gain:  
  - 2 VP for each matching **Major Role tile** they hold (once per city built).  
  - 1 VP for each matching **Minor Role tile** they hold (once per city built).

**Option B: Play Cards**  
- Play any number of Building cards from hand to the table, **face up**.  
- All played cards must be of **one color only**.  
- These cards are placed in front of you (personal display), not in a shared stack.  
- No cost or immediate effect—this increases visibility for role assignment and endgame scoring.

#### Phase 4: Assign Role Tiles  
1. Return all current Role tiles to the board (reset).  
2. Determine new Role tile ownership based on visible Building cards (face-up only):  
   - For each color:  
     - **Major Role**: Awarded to player with most visible cards of that color.  
       - Tie → auction for ownership.  
       - When tied, no Minor Role is awarded for that color.  
     - **Minor Role**: Awarded to player with second-most visible cards of that color.  
       - If only one player has cards, no Minor Role is awarded.  
       - Tie for Minor → auction for ownership.  
3. Immediately enact benefits of acquired Role tiles (if any specified).  
4. Flip upside down half (rounded up) of the Major Role tiles for each color (mechanical effect not explained beyond this).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Auctions  
- Used in Phase 2 (for building card groups) and Phase 4 (for tied roles).  
- Auction format not detailed (assume standard bid-with-money, winner pays and takes).

#### Card Visibility  
- Only **face-up** Building cards count toward Role tile assignment.  
- Face-down cards (in hand or contributed) do not contribute to visibility.

#### Shield Placement  
- Placed adjacent to completed Cities.  
- Used for regional scoring (see End Game Scoring).  
- Shields can be split between adjacent regions (for large cities with 2 shields).

#### Money  
- Starting amount: 5  
- Gained in Phase 1 (5 per player each cycle)  
- Spent to build Cities and possibly win auctions.

#### Building Cards  
- Types: Colored cards (colors implied: G, W, R, B, Y)  
- States: In hand, face down (in shared stack), face up (on table in front of player)

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Conditions  
The game ends **immediately** if either condition is met at the beginning of Phase 1:  
1. Fewer than 4 City cards are available.  
2. The Building card supply has fewer than:  
   - 12 cards (3 players)  
   - 16 cards (4 players)  
   - 20 cards (5 players)  

> If second condition triggers:  
> - Skip normal Phase 1 draw/contribute.  
> - In Phase 2: Draw directly from Building deck:  
>   - 6 cards (3p), 8 cards (4p), 10 cards (5p)  
>   - If deck has fewer, draw all remaining.

#### Final Scoring  
All players score:  
- **2 VP** per **Major Role tile** held.  
- **1 VP** per **Minor Role tile** held.  
- **2 VP** for each **Building card color** in which they have the **fewest total cards** (face-up and face-down combined) among their own holdings.  
  - Only self-comparison: e.g., if you have 3 red, 1 blue, 0 green → you get 2 VP for green and blue.  
  - Zero counts.  
- **2 VP** for having the **most Money** (all ties receive 2 VP).  
- **2 VP** for having the **most Building cards in hand** (all ties receive 2 VP).  
- **Regional Scoring** (based on Shield placement):  
  - **Majority** in each Region → 5 VP (all ties receive 5 VP; no second place)  
  - **Second Majority** in each Region → 2 VP (all ties receive 2 VP)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I play zero cards during “Play Cards” action?**  
A: No—playing cards requires playing at least one card of a single color. If you cannot or will not, you must choose “Build City” if possible.

**Q: Do face-down contributed cards count toward endgame “fewest cards per color” scoring?**  
A: Yes—“face up AND down only” means all non-played cards in your possession (hand + contributed), but clarification needed. Best interpretation: only personal holdings (hand and face-down contributions you made) count. Shared stack cards you contributed are considered yours.

**Q: Are Role tile benefits described?**  
A: No—benefits are not detailed in the source. Rule states “enact benefits immediately,” but no examples or list provided.

**Q: Who performs actions in Phase 3?**  
A: Players take turns; turn order not specified. Likely clockwise starting from starting player.

**Q: Can I build more than one city per game?**  
A: Yes—each time you take the “Build City” action in Phase 3, you may build one city (subject to requirements). You may build one during Phase 2 and others in future Phase 3s.

**Q: Are City cards drawn or chosen?**  
A: Not specified. Likely a face-up row or draft; assume available pool from which players may select eligible ones.
