# CLIPPERS — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, powerful trading companies used fast Clipper ships to dominate new trade routes across the South Pacific. In *CLIPPERS*, players represent investors influencing these companies’ routes to maximize profits.

**Objective:** Influence trade routes to reach islands where you have Port Markers. Score points based on how many different Clipper Ship Companies connect to your ports. The player with the most points at game end wins.

### 3. Setup
1. **Appoint a Scorekeeper**: Distributes $2 in chips to each player and manages money.
2. **Place Starting Clippers**: Put one Clipper Ship of each color on its matching colored starting harbor (on right side of board). Numbers in circles indicate how many Route Segments that company has.
   - *Note:* Purple has no starting Clipper; it activates later.
3. **Place Remaining Clippers**: Put unused Clipper Ships beside the board near their starting harbors.
4. **Sort Route Segments**: Group by color and place beside the board.
   - *Purple segments not available at start.*
5. **Deal Departure Cards**: Shuffle and give one to each player.
6. **Assign Port Markers**: Each player takes the set matching their Departure Card’s nationality.
   - Place 7 Port Markers on each of the 6 islands listed on the card.
     - For ports marked "8", place **2 markers** instead of 1.
   - Keep remaining 5 Port Markers in front of you for later use.
7. **Place Option Cards**: Lay all 6 Option Cards face-up to the left of the board.
   - For 3 or 4 players: Remove one 2X Card (return to box).
8. **Determine First Player**: Youngest player becomes first, takes Grappling Hook Card.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Laying Route Segments
- Players may lay segments for **any** Clipper Ship Company (not owned by players).
- First segment for a company must connect to its starting harbor.
- Each new segment must extend from the end of an existing route (marked by Clipper Ship).
- Arrows on routes indicate direction: some routes can only be built East to West.
- A company can visit an island multiple times, but only counts **once** per island at scoring.
- A route is **dead-ended** if it cannot legally extend further.

#### Blocking Rules
- A player **cannot block** a route already started between two islands.
- If two paths exist between islands, multiple companies may use them.
- One company **cannot use both** paths between the same two islands.

#### Alternate Routes
- 9 extra Clipper Ships are off-board at start.
- When a player buys a Clipper for $3 in Phase 1, they **must** start a new route in Phase 2 or 3.
- New route may begin:
  - From the company’s original starting harbor, or
  - From any island already connected to that company.
- Once active, multiple routes of the same company can be extended independently.

#### The Purple Clipper Ship Company
- Activates when **two different** companies connect to **American Samoa**.
- After activation:
  - Players may lay **Purple Route Segments** starting from American Samoa.
  - Multiple routes can begin from American Samoa.
  - **Partial routes** (not fully connected) are allowed.
  - No Clipper Ship is used to mark route ends.
- Purpose: Can be used to block others or open new paths.

#### Option Cards
| Card | Cost | Placement Ability | Bonus Effect | Notes |
|------|------|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| **2X** | $2 | 1 or 2 segments in **both** Phase 2 and 3 | All bonuses **doubled** | May lay fewer if desired |
| **3X** | $0 | 1–3 segments in **both** Phase 2 and 3 | **No bonuses** earned | Free to take |
| **5X** | $1 | Up to 5 segments in **one** of Phase 2 or 3 | Normal bonuses | Cannot place in other phase |
| **Port Card** | $4 | Instead of normal placement in Phase 2 or 3, **move one of your Port Markers** to any vacant port space | Normal bonuses apply | Must return card after use |

- Option Cards are used only during the round they are taken.
- All cards are returned at end of round (Phase 4).

#### Bonuses
Earned immediately when placing a segment:
1. **First Connection to Island**: $2 bonus (first player to connect **any** company to an island).
2. **Second (or later) Connection by New Company**: $1 bonus (for connecting a **different** company to an island already reached).
   - No bonus if same company connects again.

**Bonus Modifiers**:
- **2X Card**: All bonuses **doubled**.
- **3X Card**: **No bonuses**.
- **5X Card**: Normal bonuses (no doubling).

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Game End Conditions
Game ends when **either** of the following occurs:
1. All Route Segments for all six Clipper Ship Companies have been placed.
2. A player cannot place a Route Segment because:
   - All companies with unplayed segments are **dead-ended**, **and**
   - Purple segments are **not available** (i.e., American Samoa not yet activated or no segments left).
   - *Note:* Even if another player could use an alternate route, if current player cannot act, game ends.

#### Final Scoring
Each player scores:
1. **Cash Value**: $1 = 1 point (all chips count).
2. **Port Markers**:
   - Each Port Marker is worth:  
     **(Island Value)** × **(Number of different Clipper Ship Companies connected to the island)**
   - Example: A port on Tahiti (value 4) with 3 different companies connected → 4 × 3 = 12 points per marker.
   - A company counts only **once per island**, even if multiple routes connect.

#### Winning
- Highest total score wins.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Most money in chips.
  2. If still tied, the **last player among the tied** who did **not complete a full turn** wins.
