### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Confucius*, players represent powerful families in Ming Dynasty China vying for influence in the imperial court. The game is set during a period of expansion, reconstruction, and political maneuvering inspired by Confucian ideals. Players compete to earn the most victory points (VP) through strategic control of ministries, naval exploration, military conquests, and social influence via gift-giving.

**Objective**: Earn the most VP by:
- Controlling ministries (as Minister or Secretary),
- Discovering Distant Lands,
- Successfully invading Foreign Lands,
- Receiving end-game titles (Chief Minister, Admiral, General).

The game ends when any of the following occur: all ministries are resolved, all candidate officials are claimed, or the Great Wall is completed (Round 9). The player with the most VP wins; tiebreakers are Admiral, then Chief Minister, then General.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds in phases:

1. **Count Gifts Phase**  
   Count each player’s total of gifts given and received:
   - 0 gifts → 3 action cubes  
   - 1–2 gifts → 4 action cubes  
   - 3+ gifts → 5 action cubes  

2. **Choose Chief Minister (CM) Phase**  
   - Round 1: Random CM.  
   - Subsequent rounds: Previous CM chooses any other player as new CM.  
   - New CM places 1 action cube on **Imperial Favour** space.

3. **Actions Phase**  
   - Player to the left of CM starts.
   - Players take turns clockwise, performing one action per turn.
   - Players pass when done; may use Emperor’s Reward cards after passing.
   - **Imperial Favour** is always the last action, taken by CM.

   **Action Rules**:
   - Most actions require placing 1 action cube the first time taken.
   - Repeating the same action or taking a paired action requires 2 cubes.
   - Paired actions:
     - Bribe Official / Secure Official
     - Buy Junks / Start a Voyage
     - Recruit Army / Invade Foreign Land
   - **Transfer Influence** costs no cubes.
   - **Emperor’s Reward** actions cost no cubes and can be used anytime.

4. **Court Phase** (in order)
   - **Build Great Wall**: Place 1 piece on track.
   - **Imperial Examination** (if triggered):
     - Triggered if: both student spaces occupied, or a player used "Force Exam".
     - Players support one student with Confucius cards (starting with CM).
     - Winner takes candidate official, places it in correct ministry (or any unresolved if full), with secured marker.
     - If ministry full, replace unbribed/unsecured official.
     - Discard tutoring cards.
     - Reveal next candidate tile (skip if ministry already resolved).
   - **Ministry Resolution** (if all 7 spaces filled and all officials bribed):
     - All markers become secured.
     - Resolve one ministry at a time (left to right).
     - If >2 players involved, weakest player supports one of top 2.
     - Continue until 2 remain: Minister (most influence), Secretary (second).
     - Award VP chits.
     - Remove temporary influence markers.
   - **Invasions** (if triggered):
     - Triggered if: all boxes on a Foreign Land filled, OR Great Wall reaches soldier icon (Rounds 4, 6, 8).
     - Success: all boxes filled → contributors gain VP.
     - Failure: no VP.
     - Regardless: player with army on Emperor Reward icon gains 1 Emperor’s Reward card.
     - Flip tile; armies remain.

5. **End of Round Phase**
   - **Add Officials**: For each ministry with empty spaces, add 1 random official tile to lowest-numbered space.
   - **Discard**: Players discard down to 4 Confucius cards.
   - **Return Cubes**: Return all action cubes to players.
   - **Check Game End**: If last candidate official claimed, all ministries resolved, or Round 9 → proceed to final scoring.
