# Foodie Forest / Too Many Cooks – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Foodie Forest* (also known as *Too Many Cooks*), players are forest animals or chefs competing to become the Sovereign of Soup by creating the best dish from a shared pot. Each round, players choose a recipe (menu) that defines their scoring method. The goal is to collect the most victory points (stars) over five rounds by strategically playing ingredient cards and winning tricks that align with their chosen recipe.

### 2. Components
- **52 Ingredient Cards**:
  - 14 Pea (or Vegetable)
  - 14 Mushroom (or Insect)
  - 14 French Onion (or Fruit)
  - 10 Chili Pepper (or Garbage/Trash)
- **25 Recipe/Menu Cards** (5 identical sets of 5 types):
  - Pea Soup
  - Mushroom Soup
  - French Onion Soup
  - Chili Soup
  - No Soup Today
- **36–37 Victory Point Tokens (Stars)**:
  - Typically includes 1s, 2s, and 5s for flexible scoring

### 3. Setup
- Each player receives:
  - 5 different Recipe/Menu cards (one of each type)
  - 5 victory points (as a 5-star token or equivalent)
- Choose a starting Dealer.
- For each deal:
  - The Dealer shuffles the 52 Ingredient cards and deals:
    - 13 cards per player (2–4 players)
    - 10–11 cards per player (5 players; exact count may vary slightly due to 52 cards not dividing evenly)
- Set remaining tokens in a reserve.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
A full game consists of **5 deals** (rounds). Each deal follows this sequence:

#### 1. Deal Cards
- Dealer distributes cards as above.

#### 2. Choose a Recipe
- Players privately select **one** Recipe/Menu card from their remaining set.
- All reveal simultaneously.
- The chosen card remains face up for scoring.

#### 3. Play Tricks
- Starting with the player to the **left of the Dealer**, players take turns clockwise.
- On your turn:
  - Play **one card** from your hand to the central "pot".
  - Announce the **cumulative total** of all cards in the pot.
  - **First card rules**:
    - Any card may be played.
    - If it is a **10**, announce it as **0**.
    - The **color/type** of the first card sets the required suit for the trick—unless it is a Chili/Garbage card.
  - **Following cards**:
    - Must **match the first card’s type** (e.g., Pea, Mushroom), **if able**.
    - If you **cannot match**, play any card.
    - **Once a Chili/Garbage card is played**, the trick becomes **wild**—any card may be played regardless of type.
  - **Boil-Over (Large 0 card)**:
    - When played, the pot total resets to **0**.
    - The trick continues; suit requirement (if any) remains.
  - **Winning a Trick**:
    - When a card causes the pot total to reach **10 or more**, that player **wins the trick**.
    - They take all cards and place them in a face-down pile in front of them.
    - That player then **leads the next trick** by playing any card.

#### 4. End of Deal
- Players must **announce "last card"** when playing their penultimate card.
- The deal ends when a player is **to play but has no cards**.
  - That trick is **not won**; discard it.
- All players then **score** based on their chosen Recipe.
- Discard used Recipe cards.
- Dealer passes clockwise.
- Begin next deal.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Trick Play**: A trick continues until someone fills the pot (≥10) or the deal ends prematurely.
- **Suit Matching**: Players must follow the first card’s type unless they cannot or a Chili/Garbage card has been played.
- **Chili/Garbage Effect**: Makes the trick wild—no suit restrictions afterward.
- **Boil-Over (0)**: Resets pot total to 0 but does not end the trick.
- **Hand Management**: Players must balance when to win tricks based on their recipe.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
After each deal, players score based on their chosen Recipe:

#### Pea / Mushroom / French Onion Soup:
- **+1 point** per card of the matching type in won tricks
- **–1 point** per Chili/Garbage card in won tricks

#### Chili Soup:
- **+1 point** per Chili/Garbage card in won tricks
- **–1 point** per Bouillon/Small 0 card in won tricks

#### No Soup Today:
- **+5 points** automatically
- **–1 point** per card collected (from any trick)

- Total score may be negative, but **final score cannot drop below 0**.
- Adjust victory point tokens using the reserve.
- Players discard their used Recipe card after each deal.

#### End of Game:
- After **5 deals**, the player with the **most points wins**.
- **Tie**: Players tie and **share the victory**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I go below 0 points?**  
  No. Score adjustments stop at 0.
- **What if I play my last card and the pot is still under 10?**  
  The trick is **not won**. Play continues until the turn comes back to the player with no cards—then the deal ends.
- **Can I play a 10 as a 0 later in a trick?**  
  No. Only a **10 led as the first card** is treated as 0. If played later, it counts as 10.
- **What happens to leftover cards in hands at the end of a deal?**  
  They are **discarded** and do not count for scoring.
- **Can I reuse a Recipe card?**  
  No. Each of the 5 Recipe cards is used **once per game**.
