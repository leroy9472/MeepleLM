## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
UR is a strategy board game of territorial control and resource management set in an ancient Mesopotamian-inspired world. Players represent competing city-states vying for dominance through agriculture, culture, commerce, politics, and war. The objective is to earn the most victory points by building Ziggurats and controlling valuable tile combinations at the end of the game.

### 2. Components  
- Game board composed of hexagonal tiles (Agriculture/Green, Culture/Yellow, Commerce/Purple, Politics/Blue, War/Red)  
- Player cubes (tokens) in different colors  
- Ziggurats (5 total, one per player)  
- Action tiles representing tile types (used for hand and board exchange)

*Note: Specific quantities are not provided in source.*

### 3. Setup  
- Each player starts with no presence on the board.  
- On a player’s first turn, if they have no cubes on the board, they must place 3 cubes on a single unoccupied tile.  
- Players begin with one action tile in hand; after placing initial cubes, they exchange it with an unoccupied tile from the board that does not match their current hand tile.  
- The board begins with unoccupied tiles available for claiming.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, choose **one** of the following five actions:

1. **Perform both actions** shown on your hand tile (front and back).  
2. **Perform one action** from your hand tile and place **1 cube** on any tile you control.  
3. **Perform no actions**, and place a total of **2 cubes** on any combination of tiles you control.  
4. **Perform no actions**, and place **1 cube** on any unoccupied tile.  
5. **Perform no actions**, and **build 1 or 2 Ziggurats** on tiles you control that have exactly 5 cubes.  
   - To build: Remove 4 cubes, place a Ziggurat, leave 1 cube to show ownership.  
   - A tile with a Ziggurat is permanently removed from play for future actions.

After completing your chosen action:  
- **Exchange** your current hand tile with an unoccupied tile from the board that does **not match** your hand tile in type (color).  
- If you cannot make this exchange, the game ends immediately.

**Cube Limit:** Maximum of 5 cubes allowed on any single tile.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action Types  
Each action applies once per tile you control of that type.

**Agriculture (Green):**  
- Place 2 cubes on **each** Agriculture tile you control.  
- Then, remove 1 cube from **each** tile you control that is **not orthogonally adjacent** to at least one of your Agriculture tiles.  
- *FAQ Clarification:* If you lack enough cubes, you may place fewer than 2 per Agriculture tile.

**Culture (Yellow):**  
- For **each** occupied tile (yours or opponent’s) orthogonally adjacent to **any** of your Culture tiles, the **owner** places 1 additional cube on that tile.  
- Effects stack: a tile adjacent to two of your Culture tiles gains 2 cubes.  
- *FAQ Clarification:* You may distribute limited cubes as you choose, but adjacent opponents still benefit if they have cubes available.

**Commerce (Purple):**  
- For **each** Purple tile you control:  
  - Gain 1 cube for each **enemy tile** orthogonally adjacent to it.  
  - Gain 1 cube for each **board edge** it touches.  
- Place that many cubes on the Purple tile.  
- *FAQ Clarification:* If you lack cubes, you may place fewer.

**Politics (Blue):**  
- Redistribute your cubes freely among **any tiles you control**.  
- You may abandon tiles (leave them with 0 cubes).  
- No Blue tiles required to perform this action.

**War (Red):**  
- You may make **multiple attacks** this turn.  
- Attack from a tile you control to an **orthogonally adjacent** tile that is unoccupied or enemy-controlled.  
- Cost to attack:  
  - Equal to number of enemy cubes (or 1 for unoccupied tile) **+1 extra cube**.  
  - The **+1 penalty is waived** if:  
    - The **attacking tile** is a War (Red) tile, **or**  
    - The **attacked tile** is the same color as the attacking tile.  
- You **must move at least 1 cube** to the conquered tile.  
- You **must have enough cubes** to both pay the cost and occupy the tile.  
- You may leave the attacking tile empty afterward.  
- *Note:* Cannot be used to move between your own tiles—use Politics instead.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Triggers (Game ends when either occurs):  
1. The **last Ziggurat (5th)** is built — finish the current round.  
2. A player cannot exchange their hand tile (no valid unoccupied, non-matching tile available) — game ends immediately.

#### Final Scoring:  
- Players score victory points based on **sets of tiles** containing one of each type: Agriculture, Culture, Commerce, Politics, War.  
- Each complete set scores 1 point per cube on its tiles (including the ownership cube under a Ziggurat).  
- **Ziggurats count as tiles** in sets, but:  
  - Only one Ziggurat per set.  
  - A Ziggurat replaces the tile type it’s built on.  
- Example: A set with a Ziggurat on a Culture tile still counts as a valid set.  
- **Tiebreaker:** If players are tied in victory points, the player with the **most cubes on the board** wins. If still tied, it’s a draw.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Order of Actions:** You may perform two actions in any order. Placing a cube (option 2) can be done before or after an action.  
- **Ziggurat Rules:**  
  - Building a Ziggurat does not exempt you from tile exchange.  
  - No more than 5 Ziggurats can be built.  
  - A Ziggurat tile is inert—no actions affect it, and it cannot be attacked or used for adjacency effects.  
- **Politics/War Abandonment:** You may leave tiles empty when using Politics or War actions.  
- **Tile Matching for Exchange:** You must exchange your hand tile for one that is **not the same type** (color) and is **unoccupied**.  
- **No Starting Presence:** If you have no cubes on the board at the start of your turn, place 3 cubes on an unoccupied tile, then exchange your hand tile.
