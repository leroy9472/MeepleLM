5. Core Mechanics  

**Leaders**  
- Caesar: Movement 2, cannot fight, cannot be purchased. If captured, player is eliminated. Acts like a General otherwise.  
- General: Movement 2, cannot fight, cannot be purchased. Can lead one legion (1–7 combat units). Can be captured.  
- City: Cannot move or fight. Adds 5 talents to tribute. Normal cost: 30.  
- Fortified City: Cannot move or fight. Adds 5 talents to tribute and +1 to combat advantage. Normal cost: 55 (or 25 to upgrade a city).  

**Combat Units**  
- Infantry: Cost 10, Movement 1, destroyed on 4+. Must be with a leader. Can move along roads.  
- Cavalry: Cost 25, Movement 2, destroyed on 5+ (land), 4+ (sea). Must be with a leader. On galleys, defends like infantry at 4+.  
- Catapult: Cost 40, Movement 1, destroyed on 6+. Must be with a leader. Adds +1 to combat advantage. Can move along roads.  
- Galley: Cost 25, Movement 2, destroyed on 3+. Can be attacked only after all combat units are destroyed. Can carry one legion. Can move without a leader. Does not participate in land battles.  

**Legion Rules**  
- A legion consists of 1–7 combat units and at least one leader (Caesar, General, or City).  
- Multiple legions may occupy a province if each has a leader for every 7 combat units.  
- Only Caesars and Generals can move legions. Cities cannot move.  

**Movement**  
- Land:  
  - Infantry/Catapult-only legions: Move 1 province.  
  - Cavalry-inclusive legions: Move 2 provinces.  
  - Along roads: Any distance between connected cities (owned by same player). Roads must be in adjacent provinces and cannot cross water.  
- Sea:  
  - Galleys move 2 sea zones per turn.  
  - Can transport one legion.  
  - Loading/unloading costs no movement.  
  - Cannot move from one coast directly to another; must enter sea zone.  
  - A galley ending on a coast may launch next turn into any adjacent sea zone.  

**Combat Sequence**  
1. Calculate Combat Advantage:  
   - Each catapult or fortified city gives +1.  
   - Subtract defender’s total from attacker’s. Positive difference is the combat advantage.  
2. Attacker declares target.  
3. Attacker rolls 1 die.  
4. If roll + combat advantage ≥ target’s destroy number, remove target.  
5. Recalculate combat advantage (e.g., if a catapult is destroyed).  
6. Defender declares target.  
7. Defender rolls 1 die.  
8. If roll + combat advantage ≥ target’s destroy number, remove target.  
9. Repeat until:  
   a) Attacker destroyed → defender wins, captures leaders  
   b) Attacker retreats (land only) → must retreat to own adjacent land province; galleys left behind are destroyed  
   c) Defender destroyed → attacker wins, captures territory and leaders  

**Naval Combat**  
- Same sequence, but no retreats allowed.  
- Galleys cannot be targeted until all combat units aboard are destroyed.  
- Galleys destroyed on 3+.  

**Winning a Battle**  
- Conquering a land province:  
  - Move tribute marker forward by province value (5 or 10) +5 if city present.  
  - Defeated player moves marker back by same amount.  
  - Attacker places control marker in province.  
  - Any enemy galleys on coast are destroyed.  
- Conquering a Home Province:  
  - In addition, capturing player takes all unspent tribute from defeated player.  
  - Defeated player cannot collect tribute until Home Province is recaptured.  

**Capturing Leaders**  
- Captured General:  
  - Can be eliminated or held as prisoner (placed sideways in captor’s Home Province or with Caesar if Home is lost).  
  - Can be ransomed (agreed-upon talents) or exchanged. Returned to Home Province or Caesar.  
- Captured Caesar:  
  - Captor wins immediately if last Caesar standing.  
  - Otherwise:  
    - Move tribute marker up by defeated player’s total tribute value.  
    - Take all unspent tribute.  
    - Collect 100-talent bonus.  
    - Take control of all defeated player’s units and territories.  
    - Cannot build galleys in defeated color or reactivate destroyed generals.  
    - Cannot use captured Caesar as general; keep as prisoner.  
    - New units still placed only in captor’s Home Province.  

**Destroy Cities (Optional)**  
- Player may destroy their own city (including fortification) to deny enemy use.  
- Remove city and all connecting roads.  
- Move tribute marker back 5 talents.  

**Inflation**  
- First Inflation: Triggered when any player’s tribute marker passes 100.  
- Second Inflation: Triggered when any player’s tribute marker passes 200.  
- Prices:  
  - Pre-inflation: Normal cost  
  - First Inflation: Double normal cost  
  - Second Inflation: Triple normal cost  
- Inflation remains active even if marker drops below threshold.  

**Purchasing and Placement**  
- Purchase during Phase 5 using collected tribute.  
- New units placed in Phase 6:  
  - Combat units and galleys: Home Province only (galleys on coast).  
  - Cities: Any controlled province without a city.  
  - Fortifications: On any owned city.  
  - Roads: Free; connect adjacent friendly cities.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Scoring: Tribute collected each turn based on controlled provinces and cities.  
- End Game: Game ends when only one Caesar remains. That player wins.  
- Players may concede if defeat is inevitable.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can a legion move and fight in the same turn? Yes, during Movement phase, then Combat.  
- Can a Caesar move into an enemy province alone? No; moving into enemy territory triggers combat, and a Caesar cannot move into combat alone.  
- Can a galley move 2 sea zones and then land? Yes, but not in same turn as boarding or disembarking.  
- What happens to roads if a city is lost? All roads connected to that city are removed.  
- Can a player attack multiple provinces in one turn? Yes, resolve each combat separately.  
- Can a captured General be used by the captor? No; it remains a prisoner until ransomed or exchanged.  
- Can a city be built on an island? Yes, if controlled and no city present.  
- Can a legion move along roads without a Caesar/General present? Only if the city is the leader and a Caesar/General enters to lead it out.
