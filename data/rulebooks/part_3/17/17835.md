## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Monsters Menace America*, players control giant monsters rampaging across the United States, battling military forces and each other. The objective is to survive the Monster Challenge and emerge as the last standing monster (or Giant Unit). Until then, players must grow their monster’s Health, collect Infamy, and weaken opponents through stomping, mutating, and combat.

The game ends when the final Stomp marker is placed, triggering the Final Monster Challenge between the top two contenders. The winner of this showdown must then defeat any Giant Units on the board to claim victory.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has five phases:

1. **Dust is Settling Phase**  
2. **Movement Phase**  
3. **Fight Phase**  
4. **Encounter Phase**  
5. **Deploy Phase**

Play proceeds clockwise until Endgame is triggered.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### a. Dust is Settling Phase  
Resolve an ongoing Encounter if Focus token is present and monster remains in space.  
- **Stomp**:  
  - City: gain Health  
    - "1hp": +1 Health  
    - "1d"/"2d"/"3d": roll dice, sum = Health gained  
  - Military Base: gain 1 Infamy; controlling player gives one undeployed unit as Trophy  
  - Infamy Site: gain 2 Infamy  
  - Place Stomp marker; location cannot be stomped again  
  - Multiple icons = all benefits applied  
- **Mutate**: draw 1 Mutation card, play face-up. Can only Mutate once per space.  
- Remove Focus token after resolution.

#### b. Movement Phase  
- **Monster Movement**:  
  - Move up to Move stat.  
  - Cannot enter space with another monster.  
  - Stops upon entering space with any Military Unit (even own).  
  - Cannot cross water barriers without special ability.  
  - **Vanish Option**: Remove monster from board. On next turn, place on any unoccupied Lair; restore Health to starting value.  
- **Military Unit Movement**:  
  - Move up to Move stat.  
  - Only control your assigned Branch’s units.  
  - Cannot move National Guard units (even if deployed by you), unless via Research card.  
  - Units stop upon entering monster’s space.  
  - Unlimited units per space.  
  - Giant Units follow same rules but are treated like monsters in combat.

#### c. Fight Phase  
Battle occurs if:
- Monster shares space with Military Units
- Two monsters are adjacent (Monster Challenge)

##### Combat with Military:
- Exactly 2 Battle Rounds
- **Attacker**: side that moved into space. Exception: if monster attacks units on Base, military attacks first.
- **Attacks**:  
  - Monster: 3 per round. Spend 1 Infamy for +1 attack.  
  - Each Military Unit: 1 attack per round  
- **Attack Resolution**:  
  - Declare target, roll d6  
  - Hit if ≥ target’s Defense  
  - Natural 6 = +1 Damage  
  - Apply damage immediately  
- **After 2 Rounds**:  
  - If any military units survive → Monster must retreat  
    - Attacking player chooses adjacent empty space (respect movement type)  
    - Each player with units in battle draws 1 Research card  
  - If all units destroyed → Monster wins; units return to Branch card for redeployment  

##### Immediate Health Boost (Monster KO):  
When Health drops to 0 or below, spend Infamy tokens:  
- +2 Health per token  
- Can restore up to starting Health +1  
- Prevents going to Hollywood

##### Monster vs. Monster (Challenge):  
- Occurs when two monsters are adjacent  
- 1 Battle Round (repeat if tie)  
- Challenger (mover) attacks first  
- Winner is determined by total damage dealt  
- Winner steals 1 Infamy from loser, then forces retreat to legal adjacent space  
- If retreat space has units or adjacent monster → new battle begins  
- Loser does not gain Health from win

#### d. Encounter Phase  
Only if monster did not retreat this turn.  
- Place Focus token to initiate Encounter for next turn  
- Types:  
  1. **Stomp**: Destroy City, Base, or Infamy Site  
  2. **Mutate**: Draw Mutation card (only once per space)  
- Cannot Encourage if retreated

#### e. Deploy Phase  
Choose one:  
- **Deploy Units** or  
- **Draw 1 Research Card** (or retain "Guard Commander" card)

##### Deploying from Your Branch:  
- Units available based on Branch card  
- Base deployment rules:  
  - ≥5 Bases remaining: 1 unit per Base per turn  
  - ≤4 Bases remaining: unlimited per Base  
- Cannot deploy to Base occupied by Monster  
- **Redeploy**: move existing unit from board to any Base of same Branch (excludes Giant Units and National Guard)

##### Deploying National Guard:  
- Deploy to any unstomped City, Base, or Infamy Site without Monster  
- 1 National Guard Unit per space  
- Cannot deploy both NG and regular unit to same space in same turn  
- Cannot redeploy NG units  
- **Emergency Forces**: If no NG units available, deploy 1 of your Branch’s units instead  
- If prevented by "Guard Commander" card, same emergency rule applies

##### Giant Units:  
- Enter via Research cards  
- Have Health, Damage, Defense stats  
- Captain Colossal: 2 attacks per round  
- Treat as Military Units but fight like monsters  
- Cannot mutate, stomp, gain/spend Infamy  
- Cannot be redeployed  
- Placing them doesn’t count toward 1-unit-per-base limit  
- Destroyed permanently at 0 Health

##### Guard Commander Card:  
- Grants control over National Guard deployment  
- After your turn, pass to player on your right

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Endgame Trigger**: Last Stomp marker is placed.

**Final Challenge Setup**:  
- Only two monsters with highest **Infamy + Trophies** enter Final Challenge  
- Tiebreakers: Trophies → Health → die roll  
- First of the two to initiate Encounter on Challenge hex becomes Challenger  
- Other is Defender; moved to same hex

**Disqualifications**:  
- Monsters in Hollywood are out  
- Other monsters ranked by Infamy + Trophies but do not fight

**Infamy Adjustment (to balance)**:  
- Highest: lose Infamy down to second-highest total  
- Second-highest: lose all Infamy  

**Final Battle Sequence**:  
1. Fight until one or both monsters reduced to ≤0 Health  
2. Survivor (if any) fights Giant Units (if present):  
   - First Captain Colossal (if on board)  
   - Then Mecha-Monster (if on board)  
   - Not a Monster Challenge (for card effects)  
3. If monster survives all → **wins game**  
4. If monster dies or all monsters eliminated → **America wins**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Run out of cards?** Play without drawing. Ignore mechanics requiring draws.  
- **Hollywood**:  
  - Monster goes there when Health reaches 0 and doesn’t save via Infamy  
  - On next turn, roll d6, add to Health  
  - At ≥5 Health, return to LA or any Lair; move ends  
  - Can still move Military Units while in Hollywood  
- **Lairs**: No special effect. Only for starting, returning, or Vanishing  
- **Rule vs. Card Conflict**: Card text overrides general rules  
- **Excess Health**: Max is 49. Overflow discarded  
- **Card Visibility**: All kept cards are face-up in front of player. No hand.  
- **Cruise Missiles**:  
  - Destroyed after first Battle Round  
  - Roll 1 → monster draws free Mutation card  
  - Air Force: can stop on empty space  
  - Navy: must attack same turn or crash (destroyed)  
- **Nuclear Submarines**: May transform into Cruise Missiles (use * stats); must attack immediately  
- **Missile Launchers**: Gain 1 extra attack before all others in Battle Round
