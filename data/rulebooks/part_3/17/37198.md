## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The goal of Revised RISK is to be the first player to complete three Objectives (Major or Minor) and maintain control of your capital at the end of your turn. This version emphasizes strategic goal completion over total world domination, though a "World Conquest" variant is available.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with 42 territories  
- Colored troop pieces (arrows: small = 1 troop, large = 3 troops)  
- Capital markers (one per player)  
- City markers (placed on 15 territories)  
- Territory cards (without wild cards)  
- Objective cards (4 Minor, 4 Major used per game)  
- Reward tokens (Minor and Major, one per Objective)  
- Dice (standard red and black dice; bonus Attack and Defense dice for certain Rewards)  
- Airfield token  

### 3. Setup  
a. **Cities**: Draw 15 random territory cards and place a city marker on each territory shown. Reshuffle the deck.  
b. **Objectives**: Shuffle all Objective cards. Place 4 Minor and 4 Major Objectives face up on the board. Return unused cards to the box.  
c. **Rewards**: Shuffle Reward tokens. Place one Minor Reward on each Minor Objective and one Major Reward on each Major Objective.  
d. **Troops**: Distribute starting troops based on player count:  
   - 3 players: 30 troops each  
   - 4 players: 25 troops each  
   - 5 players: 20 troops each  
e. **First Player**: Determine randomly.  
f. **Capitals**: Starting with the first player, each player places their capital and one troop on an empty territory. Play proceeds clockwise.  
g. **Claim Territories**: Players continue placing one troop on empty territories until all are claimed.  
h. **Reinforce**: Players place remaining troops on any territories they control until all troops are placed.  
i. **Initial Cards**:  
   - 3rd and 4th players: 1 territory card each  
   - 5th player: 2 territory cards  
j. First player begins their turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On each turn, in order:  
1. **Draft and Place Troops**  
2. **Attack**  
3. **Collect One Objective (if eligible)**  
4. **Maneuver**  
5. **Draw a Territory Card (if eligible)**

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Drafting Troops  
- **Base Troops**: Number of territories + cities controlled, divided by 3, rounded down.  
  - Cities count as double for drafting (but only one marker per territory).  
  - Minimum: If result is less than 3, round up to 3.  
- **Capital Bonus**: +1 troop per capital controlled (including your own).  
- **Continent Bonuses**:  
  - North America: 5  
  - South America: 2  
  - Africa: 3  
  - Europe: 5  
  - Asia: 7  
  - Australia: 2  
- **Card Trades**: Trade 2–10 stars worth of territory cards for bonus troops:  
  - 2★ = 2, 3★ = 4, 4★ = 7, 5★ = 10, 6★ = 13, 7★ = 17, 8★ = 21, 9★ = 25, 10★ = 30  
  - Territories on cards are irrelevant; only stars matter.  
  - Asia cards = ★★; all others = ★  
- Place all drafted troops on controlled territories.

#### Attacking  
- Identical to classic RISK:  
  - Attack from one territory to adjacent enemy territory.  
  - Attacker rolls up to 3 dice (max 3 attacking troops).  
  - Defender rolls up to 2 dice (min 2 defending troops).  
  - Compare highest dice; ties favor defender.  
  - Continue until attacker stops or defender eliminated.

#### Objectives and Rewards  
- After attacking, if a player meets the conditions of a face-up Objective, they may claim it and its corresponding Reward.  
- Only one Objective may be claimed per turn.  
- **Eligibility Conditions**:  
  - *Control 8 Cities*: Control at least 8 city-marked territories.  
  - *Control North America/Europe/Asia*: Control all territories in the continent.  
  - *Take Over 10 Territories in 1 Turn*: Gain control of 10+ territories not held at turn start.  
  - *Control 2 Enemy Capitals*: Possess two capitals belonging to other players.  
  - *Control 18 Territories*: Control any 18 territories.  
  - *Control 2 Complete Continents*: Fully control two continents.  
  - *Take Over Entire Continent in 1 Turn*: Gain full control of a continent with no prior presence.  
  - *Control 11 Cities*: Control at least 11 cities.  
  - *Take Control of 4 Cities in 1 Turn*: Gain 4+ cities not controlled at turn start.  
- Upon elimination, a player’s Objectives are transferred to the victor; Rewards are lost.

#### Maneuver Phase  
- Move any number of troops from one controlled territory to another connected territory.  
- Must leave at least one troop behind.  
- Territories are connected if there is an unbroken chain of controlled territories between them.  
- **Additional Maneuver Reward**: Allows two maneuvers per turn.  
- **Starting Maneuver Reward**: Allows one maneuver after troop placement but before attacking.

#### Draw a Card  
- If a player conquered at least one enemy territory and did **not** claim an Objective, draw one territory card.  
- **Guaranteed Card Reward**: Draw a card regardless of conquest or Objective collection.  
- If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- A player wins immediately upon meeting two conditions at the end of their turn:  
  1. Possession of **three completed Objectives** (any combination of Major and Minor).  
  2. **Control of their own capital**.  
- The game ends as soon as one player satisfies both conditions.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you claim multiple Objectives in one turn?**  
  No. Only one Objective may be claimed per turn, even if multiple are completed.  
- **What happens when a player is eliminated?**  
  - The eliminating player takes all of the defeated player’s territory cards and Objectives.  
  - The defeated player’s capital remains on the board.  
  - Rewards are lost (not transferred).  
- **Do Airfield benefits stack?**  
  No. If multiple Airfields affect the same territory, only one +1 bonus applies.  
- **Can you move troops through a territory with a capital you don’t own?**  
  Yes, as long as you control the territory. Enemy capitals have no special movement restrictions.  
- **What if all Objectives are claimed?**  
  The game continues. Players can only claim one Objective per turn, and no new Objectives are drawn.  
- **Can you trade cards on the same turn you receive them?**  
  Yes, during your Draft phase on any future turn.  
- **Is the World Conquest variant official?**  
  Yes. Instead of stopping at 3 Objectives, play continues until one player controls all territories.
