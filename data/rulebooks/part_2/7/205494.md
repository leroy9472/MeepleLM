## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Machi Koro: Bright Lights, Big City is a city-building card game where players act as mayors expanding their cities with new establishments and landmarks. The goal is to be the first mayor to fully construct all six of your personal landmark cards, transforming your town into a bustling metropolis.

### 2. Components  
- **Cards (202 total)**  
  - Starting Establishments (10): Includes Wheat Field and Bakery  
  - Starting Landmarks (35): Includes City Hall and 5 other landmarks per player  
  - Establishments (132): Divided into 1–6 and 7+ cost cards  
  - Major Establishments (25): Unique purple cards, limited availability  
- **Coins (78)**  
- **Dice (3)**  
- **Game Rules (1 rulebook)**

### 3. Setup  
- Each player receives:  
  - $3 in coins  
  - 1 Wheat Field (Starting Establishment)  
  - 1 Bakery (Starting Establishment)  
  - 1 City Hall Landmark (placed face-up, already constructed)  
  - 5 other Landmark cards (placed face-down under construction)  
- Prepare the Marketplaces:  
  - **1–6 Marketplace**: Draw 5 unique 1–6 cost Establishments face-up, stacked lowest die number to highest (left to right). Duplicate cards are stacked on top of existing ones.  
  - **7+ Marketplace**: Draw 5 unique 7+ cost Establishments face-up, same stacking rules.  
  - **Major Establishment Marketplace**: Draw 2 unique Major Establishment cards face-up.  
- Shuffle remaining cards into three separate decks (1–6, 7+, Major Establishments).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn has three phases:

#### 1. Roll Dice  
- At start of game, roll 1 die.  
- Once Train Station is built, player may choose to roll 1 or 2 dice.  
- If 2 dice are rolled, use their sum.

#### 2. Earn Income  
Players collect income from owned Establishments matching the die roll. Activation order:  
1. **Red (Restaurants)**: Collect from active player  
2. **Green (Secondary Industry)**: Collect from bank on your turn only  
3. **Blue (Primary Industry)**: Collect from bank on any turn  
4. **Purple (Major Establishments)**: Collect from all players on your turn only  

- If multiple players are owed money simultaneously (e.g., multiple Red cards), payments are processed in **reverse player order (counter-clockwise)**.  
- Players with multiple copies of a card receive income for each copy.  
- If a player cannot pay, they pay what they can (minimum $0); debt is forgiven.

#### 3. Construction Phase  
On your turn, you may build **one** of the following:  
- Any face-up card from the 1–6 or 7+ Marketplace  
- A Major Establishment (if not already owned and available)  
- Complete construction of **one** of your face-down Landmarks (pay cost shown)  

Rules:  
- You may own **multiple copies** of regular Establishments (non-●). Stack them to track.  
- You may own **only one copy** of each Major Establishment (●) and each Landmark.  

After building, replenish the Marketplace if needed.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Market Replenishment**:  
  - If any Marketplace drops below its initial unique card count (5 for 1–6 and 7+, 2 for Major), immediately draw to refill.  
  - If a draw deck is empty, no further replenishment occurs.  
  - For Major Establishments: If all players already own both shown cards, remove them and draw two new unique ones. Discard any undrawable (unpurchasable) cards during replenishment.

- **Landmark Effects (Selected)**:  
  - **City Hall**: Before building *any* establishment or landmark on your turn, gain $1 (usable that turn). Always active.  
  - **Harbor**: On your turn, if dice total ≥10, you may add +2 to the total (affects all players).  
  - **Amusement Park**: On a double roll (your turn), take $1 from each player. You may then roll again (no limit).  
  - **Shopping Mall**: Each of your Establishments earns +1 when activated (if they produce coins).  
  - **Train Station**: Allows rolling 1 or 2 dice on your turn.  

- **Special Establishments**:  
  - **Tuna Boat**: When activated, roll 1 die. Gain that many coins × number of Tuna Boats you own. All players with Harbor gain same amount. Roll does not trigger other effects.  
  - **Tax Office**: When activated, gain half (rounded down) of what the active player would pay to others via Red cards. The paying player keeps half (rounded up).  
  - **Flower Shop**: Gains $1 per Flower Orchard you own. With Shopping Mall, gains $2 per Flower Orchard.  
  - **Moving Company**: When activated, give one of your non-● Establishments to another player (your choice).  
  - **Tech Startup**: Place $1 from your supply onto it at end of your turn. When activated, all players pay you coins equal to amount on card. Money stays on card permanently.  
  - **Publisher (#7)**: Gains $1 for each **pair** of Coffee Cup and Bread Slice icons (rounded down) among your cards.  

- **House Rules (Optional)**:  
  - **Publisher Nerf**: Use "pair of Coffee Cup/Bread Slice icons" rule instead of original.  
  - **Major Establishment Market Limit**: Only include up to one copy per player in the deck. If you already own both visible Major Establishments, pay $5 (non-refundable) to attempt to draw a new one:  
    - If it matches one you own, return it to top of deck.  
    - If different and affordable, buy it.  
    - If unaffordable, place on bottom of deck.  
    - $5 fee does not count toward purchase cost.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is **no scoring**.  
- The game ends **immediately** when a player completes their **sixth Landmark**.  
- That player wins.  
- Landmarks may be built in any order.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I use City Hall money the same turn?**  
  A: Yes. You gain $1 *before* building, and can spend it immediately.

  A: Yes. If you use Harbor’s +2 on your turn, it applies to the Tuna Boat die roll.

- **Q: Can I give away a card I just bought this turn?**  
  A: Yes, including via Moving Company.  

- **Q: Can I pay with money on Tech Startup?**  
  A: No. Money on Tech Startup is locked and cannot be used for purchases or payments.  

- **Q: What if Marketplace runs out of a card type?**  
  A: Once decks are exhausted, no more replenishment. Game continues until a player wins.
