## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Relive the age of piracy, where merchant vessels braved dangerous seas to deliver valuable cargo. In Korsar (also known as Loot), players take on the roles of pirate lords, sending out merchant ships to earn gold while using pirate fleets to capture others’ vessels.  
The objective is to amass the most gold coins when the draw pile is exhausted and one player (or team) has played their final card.

2. Components  
- 25 Merchant Ship Cards: Each displays a cargo value in gold coins. Total value: 100 gold.  
  - 5 × 2 gold  
  - 6 × 3 gold  
  - 5 × 4 gold  
  - 5 × 5 gold  
  - 2 × 6 gold  
  - 1 × 7 gold  
  - 1 × 8 gold  
- 48 Pirate Ship Cards: Divided into 4 colors (e.g., blue, green, purple, gold). Each color has:  
  - 2 × strength 1 (1 skull)  
  - 4 × strength 2 (2 skulls)  
  - 4 × strength 3 (3 skulls)  
  - 2 × strength 4 (4 skulls)  
- 4 Pirate Captain Cards: One per color. Stronger than all pirate ships combined. In case of multiple captains on a ship, the last played wins.  
- 1 Admiral Card: Equal in strength to a pirate captain. Can only be used by the owner of a merchant ship to defend it. Does not require prior pirate ships to be played.

3. Setup  
- Shuffle all cards together.  
- Deal 6 cards face down to each player.  
- Place the remaining cards face down in the center as the draw pile.  
- The player to the left of the dealer goes first. Play proceeds clockwise.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn:  
1. **Check for Captures** (before taking any action):  
   - You capture a merchant ship if:  
     a) It is your own, played on your last turn, and has no pirate attacks.  
     b) You have the strongest attack on it (highest total skull count of same-colored pirate ships, or you played the last pirate captain/admiral).  
   - Collect the captured merchant ship face down in front of you.  
   - Discard all associated pirate ships, captains, or admiral cards to a discard pile.  
2. **Take One Action**:  
   Choose exactly one of the following:  
   - **Draw a card** from the draw pile.  
   - **Play a Merchant Ship**: Place it face up in front of you, keel (bottom) facing you. It is now at sea and vulnerable to attack.  
   - **Play a Pirate Ship**: Place it face up next to a merchant ship. Keel must face you to indicate ownership.  
     - First attacker may use any color.  
     - Subsequent attackers must use a new, unused color.  
     - You may reinforce your own attack by playing more pirate ships of the same color.  
     - Attack strength = sum of skulls on same-colored pirate ships.  
   - **Play a Pirate Captain**: Place on top of one of your own same-colored pirate ships attacking a merchant.  
     - Stronger than all pirate ships combined.  
     - If multiple captains are played, the last one wins.  
   - **Play the Admiral**: Place on top of your own merchant ship.  
     - Acts like a pirate captain but only for defense.  
     - Does not require prior pirate ships.  
     - Loses to a pirate captain of the same color if played later.  
   - **Discard a card** (only if you cannot draw or play, and the draw pile is empty).

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Attack Rules**:  
  - Multiple players can attack the same merchant ship.  
  - Each color of pirate ship may only be used once per merchant ship unless reinforcing an existing attack of that color.  
  - Only the original player may reinforce their color or play their captain.  
- **Tied Battles**:  
  - If attack strengths are equal (and no captain/admiral), the battle continues unresolved.  
  - The ship remains in play until one side gains superiority.  
- **Hand Management**:  
  - No hand limit.  
  - Merchant ships cannot be discarded at any time.  
  - When the draw pile is empty, players may only play or discard (but not merchant ships).

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Game Trigger**:  
  - The game ends when the draw pile is empty AND one player plays their last card (individual play).  
  - In partnership play: when the draw pile is empty AND both members of a team have played their last cards.  
- **Final Resolution**:  
  - All unresolved merchant ships (uncaptured) are discarded.  
  - No further captures occur after the final turn.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - Add up the gold value of all captured merchant ships (face-down pile).  
  - Subtract the gold value of any merchant ships still in hand.  
  - Highest total wins.  
  - In team play: combine both partners’ captured gold and subtract both hands’ merchant ship values.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I attack my own merchant ship?**  
  Yes. You may play pirate ships or the admiral to defend or control it.  
- **Can I play a Pirate Captain without playing a pirate ship first?**  
  No. You must have played a same-colored pirate ship on that merchant earlier.  
- **Can the Admiral be played on a partner’s ship?** (Partnership)  
  Yes. You may defend either your own or your partner’s merchant ship.  
- **What happens if I run out of cards before the draw pile is empty?**  
  You continue playing. On your turn, you must draw (if possible) or, if the draw pile is empty, take another action.  
- **Can I discard a Merchant Ship?**  
  No. Merchant ships may never be discarded. Only non-merchant cards may be discarded when no action is possible.  
- **How are battles resolved when multiple captains are played?**  
  The last pirate captain or admiral played on a merchant ship wins, regardless of color or strength.
