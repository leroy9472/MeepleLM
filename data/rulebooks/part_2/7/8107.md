## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the land of Middle-earth, the One Ring—forged by Sauron to dominate all—has resurfaced. The forces of good seek to protect it from falling into evil hands, while the forces of evil strive to claim it. Players take control of armies aligned with either good or evil, vying for dominance across Middle-earth.  

**Objective**: Score the most points before the Fellowship (represented by The One Ring) reaches Mount Doom. Points are earned through territory and stronghold control, completed missions, played power cards, and region dominance. The game ends when the Fellowship successfully destroys the Ring at Mount Doom (determined by a die roll). The player with the highest score wins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Step 1: Receive and Place Reinforcements  
- **Stronghold Reinforcement**: Place 1 battalion in each territory with a **Stronghold** that you control.  
- **Territory-Based Reinforcements**:  
  - Total territories controlled ÷ 3 (round down), **minimum 3**.  
- **Region Control Bonus**:  
  - Control all territories in a region → receive bonus battalions as shown on board (e.g., Mirkwood = 4).  
- **Card Set Turn-In**:  
  - Turn in 3 Territory Cards that form a valid set:  
    - 3 of same unit type (e.g., 3 Eagles)  
    - 1 of each unit type (Archer, Rider, Eagle)  
    - Wild card can substitute for any unit  
  - Reinforcements:  
    - 3 Archers = 4 battalions  
    - 3 Riders = 6 battalions  
    - 3 Eagles = 8 battalions  
    - 1 of each = 10 battalions  
  - **Mandatory Turn-In**: If you have 5+ cards at the start of your turn, you must turn in at least one set (repeat until ≤4 cards).  
- **Place All Reinforcements**: Distribute all earned battalions across your territories.

#### Step 2: Combat  
- **Attacker Requirements**:  
  - Must have ≥2 battalions in attacking territory (1 stays behind).  
  - May attack adjacent enemy territory.  
- **Attack Dice**: Roll up to 3 red dice (based on 1–3 attacking battalions).  
- **Leader Bonus (Attack)**: +1 to highest attack die if Leader is in attacking territory.  
- **Defender Response**:  
  - May roll 1 or 2 black dice (defend with 1–2 battalions).  
- **Defender Bonuses**:  
  - **Leader present**: +1 to highest defense die  
  - **Stronghold in territory**: +1 to highest defense die  
  - **Both**: +2 to highest defense die  
- **Battle Resolution**:  
  - Compare highest vs. highest die, then second-highest vs. second-highest.  
  - **Defender wins ties**.  
  - Each loss removes one battalion from the battlefield.  
- **Invasion Continuation**:  
  - After battle, attacker may continue attacking same territory, switch attacking territory (if adjacent), or stop.  
- **Winning an Invasion**:  
  - Eliminate all defending battalions → attacker moves all attacking battalions into the territory.  
  - May move additional battalions from the original attacking territory (must leave ≥1 behind).  
  - **Leader in attack must move into conquered territory**.  
- **Eliminating a Player**:  
  - Defeat last battalion of a player → take all their **Territory Cards**.  
  - Their **Adventure Cards** are discarded.  
  - If you now have ≥5 Territory Cards, immediately turn in sets until ≤4.  
- **Adventure Card Use**:  
  - **Mission Cards**: Complete by moving a Leader into a Site of Power listed on the card (via attack or fortification). Turn in for reward.  
  - **Power Cards**: Play during combat (or as specified).  
  - **Event Cards**: Played immediately when drawn.

#### Step 3: Fortify Position  
- Move any number of battalions from one territory to another **connected** territory (path must be through your own territories).  
- Must leave ≥1 battalion in the source territory.  
- **Leaders**: Can be moved during fortification, but cannot end in same territory as other Leader.  
- May complete a **Mission** during fortification if Leader moves into a Site of Power.

#### Step 4: Collect a Territory Card  
- If you conquered **at least one territory** this turn → draw 1 Territory Card.  
- Only **one card per turn**, regardless of number of conquests.

#### Step 5: Collect an Adventure Card  
- If a **Leader** conquered a territory containing a **Site of Power** → draw 1 Adventure Card.  
- If it’s an **Event Card** ("Play Immediately"), resolve it, then draw again. Repeat until drawing a Mission or Power card.  
- Add final card to hand.  
- If hand now exceeds 4 Adventure Cards, discard one.  
- **Only one Adventure Card per turn**, regardless of multiple Site of Power conquests.  
- After drawing, **no further cards may be played** this turn.

#### Step 6: Replace a Leader  
- If you have **no Leader on the board**, place one in any territory you control.

#### Step 7: Move the Fellowship  
- Move The One Ring **one territory** along the Path of the Fellowship.  
- If current territory has **die symbol**:  
  - Roll one die.  
  - **4–6**: Move forward.  
  - **1–3**: Fellowship stays; next player attempts roll.  
- Repeat until successful move.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when the Fellowship reaches **Mount Doom** and a die roll of **4–6** destroys the Ring.  
- Each turn, after Step 7, when the Ring reaches Mount Doom, roll one die:  
  - **4–6**: Ring destroyed → game ends.  
  - **1–3**: Ring not destroyed → continue play; next player attempts roll at end of their turn.  

**Scoring**:  
- **1 point** per territory controlled  
- **2 points** per Stronghold controlled  
- **Points** from **played** Adventure Cards (Mission and Power cards only; value on card)  
- **Points** for each **fully controlled region** = battalion bonus for that region (e.g., Mirkwood = 4 points)  

**Winner**: Player with the highest total score.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I attack multiple territories in one turn?**  
  Yes, as long as you complete one invasion before starting another.  
- **Can I fortify through a territory with my other Leader?**  
  Yes, but the moving Leader cannot end its move there.  
- **Do I get an Adventure Card if my Leader is in a Site of Power but didn’t conquer it this turn?**  
  No—only if the Leader **conquered** the Site of Power **this turn**.  
- **Can I play Adventure Cards after drawing one?**  
  No—once you draw an Adventure Card (Step 5), no more cards can be played that turn.  
- **What happens if the Fellowship is stuck on a die-roll space for many turns?**  
  Each player, at the end of their turn, rolls to move it. It remains until a 4–6 is rolled.  
- **Can I have more than 4 Adventure Cards?**  
  Only temporarily. If you draw and exceed 4, you must immediately discard down to 4.  
- **Do neutral army units in 2-player game get reinforcements or leaders?**  
  No. Neutral army only defends, cannot attack, fortify, receive cards, or gain leaders.
