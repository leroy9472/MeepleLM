- "Victor's Initiative" card
- Recruit Pile: 5 face-down cards at setup
- Supporter Pile: 1 face-up card per player at setup

---

### 3. Setup
1. Give the **Victor's Initiative** card to the oldest player. In subsequent skirmishes, the previous winner takes this card.
2. (Optional) New players may remove the two Bruce Clan cards.
3. Shuffle all cards.
4. Deal 5 cards to each player.
5. Create the **Recruit Pile**: Place 5 cards face-down in a row.
6. Create the **Supporter Pile**: Place 1 face-up card per player. If all cards are of the same value, discard and refresh the pile.
7. Form the **Draw Pile** with remaining cards. If the Draw Pile empties, shuffle all discarded cards to form a new Draw Pile.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in **five rounds** (turns per player), followed by **skirmish resolution**.

#### Each Round:
1. The player with the **Victor's Initiative** card reveals one face-down card from the **Recruit Pile** at the start of their turn. This indicates the current round (1st to 5th).
2. Starting with the player holding the **Victor's Initiative**, players take turns clockwise.
3. On a turn, a player chooses **one** of the following actions:

##### a. Recruit a Clan
*(Only if the player has fewer than 10 cards in hand)*
- Take one card from the **Recruit Pile** and add it to your hand.
- Replace it by drawing a card from the **Draw Pile** and placing it in the same position (face-up if the taken card was face-up, face-down if it was face-down).

##### b. Muster a Clan
- Play one card from your hand to your army area (in front of you).
- Choose to play it:
  - **Face-Up**: The clan’s value is added to your army strength. If its value is **lower than any other face-up clan** in play, its **bloodline power activates**.
    - In 4–5 player games: A clan’s power activates if its value is less than any other **face-up clan of the same bloodline** already in play.
  - **Face-Down**: Only the card’s value counts toward army strength; no power is used.

> **Note**: Bloodline powers activate **only when the card is played**, not if acquired later (e.g., via swaps).

---

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Bloodline Powers
Each clan belongs to a bloodline with a unique power. To activate:
- Card must be played **face-up**.
- Its value must be **lower** than any other face-up clan in the skirmish (or same-bloodline clan in 4–5 player games).
- Power triggers **immediately upon playing**.

> Powers are categorized as:
- **Pre-Skirmish Powers**: Take effect during preparation.
- **Post-Skirmish Powers**: Take effect during or after resolution, and only if the player still controls the clan.

#### Token Use
Tokens are awarded via card effects and used as follows:
- **Claim two Supporters**: Take two supporter cards during skirmish resolution.
- **Do not discard**: Retain this card or effect through reset phases.
- **Join any Bloodline**: This clan is considered part of any bloodline for doubling purposes.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Resolving the Skirmish (after 5 rounds):
1. All players reveal their mustered clans.
2. Calculate **Army Strength**:
   - Sum the values of all mustered clans.
   - **If all clans are of the same bloodline**, **double** the total.
3. Rank players by army strength (highest to lowest).
   - Tiebreaker: Highest individual clan value wins.
4. Players claim **one Supporter card** each from the **Supporter Pile**, in descending order.
   - A player must have **at least one clan** mustered to claim.
   - If the pile is empty, no one else scores.
5. The top-scoring player takes the **Victor's Initiative** card.
6. **Reset**:
   - Discard all mustered clans, Recruit Pile, and Supporter Pile.
   - Rebuild:
     - Recruit Pile: 5 face-down cards.
     - Supporter Pile: 1 face-up card per player (refresh if all same value).
   - Players **keep** their hand; no new cards are dealt.
7. Begin next skirmish.

#### End of Game:
- The game ends when **any player reaches 40 or more points** (from Supporter cards).
- In case of a tie, the player who **placed higher in the final skirmish** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I play a card face-up even if its power won’t activate?**  
  Yes. You may always play face-up; the power simply won’t trigger unless conditions are met.

- **What happens if the Draw Pile runs out?**  
  Shuffle all discarded cards to form a new Draw Pile.

- **Can face-down clans contribute to bloodline doubling?**  
  Yes. Bloodline identity is known even when played face-down. All mustered clans count toward same-bloodline condition.

- **Do bloodline powers stack?**  
  Yes, if multiple clans meet activation conditions when played, each triggers its power.

- **What if the Supporter Pile has fewer cards than scoring players?**  
  Players claim in order until the pile is exhausted. Remaining players score nothing.

- **Are "Join any Bloodline" tokens usable for doubling?**  
  Yes. A clan with this token can be counted as part of any bloodline, enabling full army doubling if all clans (including it) are treated as same bloodline.
