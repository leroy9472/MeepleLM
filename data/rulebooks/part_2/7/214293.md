## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 1931, an expedition to Antarctica uncovers an ancient, hidden city beyond impassable mountains. As members of the team, players must cooperate to scale the mountain, discover relics, and escape before madness and injury overwhelm them.  

**Objective**: Successfully escape the mountain and have **more Relic cards than Injury cards** (combined in the Injury deck, Equipment discard pile, and all players’ hands) to win. If not, the expedition fails.  

Additional losses occur if:  
- The last Leadership token is returned to the box.  
- An Injury card must be drawn but the Injury deck is empty.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has 5 phases:  

#### 1. Movement Phase  
- Leader chooses an adjacent space to move the Airplane.  
- On **Turn 1**, must start on a Coast tile.  
- Cannot stay on same space.  
- **Edge of Madness Rule**: Once reached, cannot descend. Must move to Escape tiles for next 3 turns to escape.  
- **Discard Leadership Token (optional)**: Leader may discard 1+ tokens to let a chosen player ignore their Madness **for the entire turn**.  

If moving to a space with a tile:  
- Tile is placed in front of Leader and will be revealed in Encounter Phase.  
If moving to empty space:  
- No reward, but still face challenges shown on board space.  

#### 2. Encounter Phase  
- Flip **Sand Timer**.  
- Reveal Encounter tile (if applicable).  
- All players with Madness cards **must follow their restrictions immediately**.  
- Players discuss equipment available (without showing cards) to meet Challenge Values.  
- **Communication is allowed only during this discussion phase**, before any card is played.  

**Action**:  
- Any player may play **Equipment** or **Injury cards** face down on Sled Board.  
- **All communication stops immediately** when first card is played.  
- Players may continue playing cards silently until timer runs out.  
- **Speaking during silence**: Roll Penalty Die immediately.  

**Discard Leadership Token (after timer ends)**:  
- Leader may discard 1+ tokens to **restart Encounter Phase**.  
  - Flip timer, allow discussion again.  
  - Can be done multiple times.  
- Madness effects remain active.  

#### 3. Resolution Phase  
- Leader reveals all cards on Sled Board.  
- For each Challenge:  
  - Sum values of matching Equipment type.  
  - If total matches Challenge Value (exact or within range) → **Success**  
  - Else → **Failure**  

**Success**:  
- If **at least one Challenge** succeeded, gain **Reward** (bottom-right of tile):  
  - **Relic**: Leader chooses player to receive Relic card (Specimen/Ruin/Knowledge).  
    - Recipient draws a Madness card (see below).  
    - Take matching **Relic token** and place on Player Board, covering specified space.  
    - Cannot use Leadership tokens during this phase for the rest of the game.  
    - If already has a Knowledge Relic, do not take another Knowledge token.  
  - **Search**: Leader reveals any face-down tile for 30 seconds (cannot use Leadership tokens to extend).  
  - **Arcane Equipment**: Leader takes any Arcane Equipment card and adds to Equipment discard.  
  - **Heal**: Return one Injury card from discard to Injury deck.  
  - **Praise**: Take up to 2 Leadership tokens from discard and return to Sled Board.  

**Failure**:  
- For each failed Challenge, choose **one** consequence:  
  1. **One player draws a Madness card** (cannot choose if all have Level 3).  
  2. **Leader rolls Penalty Die**.  

Apply consequences one at a time. Order of failures can be chosen.  

**Drawing a Madness Card**:  
- No Madness → draw Level 1  
- Has Level 1 or 2 → return it, draw next level  
- Has Level 3 → cannot be chosen  
- If all players have Level 3 and one must draw → discard a Leadership token instead  
  - If no tokens on Sled, return one from discard to box  
  - If last token is returned → **lose immediately**  

**Penalty Die Effects**:  
- **Accident**: Draw 2 Injury cards → add to Equipment discard  
  - If Injury deck empty → **lose immediately**  
- **Confusion**: Discard number of cards from Equipment deck equal to difference between played total and Challenge Value (use nearest bound of range)  
- **Loss of Confidence**: Discard 2 Leadership tokens from Sled  
  - If <2 tokens: return 1 to box  
  - If last token returned → **lose immediately**  

**Discard Leadership Token (Resolution Phase)**:  
- Discard 1 token to **reroll Penalty Die**  
- Can discard multiple times, one at a time, after seeing result  

End of Resolution Phase:  
- Discard all played cards  
- Set aside used Encounter tile  

#### 4. Draw Phase  
- Leader deals Equipment cards so all players reach hand limit:  
  - 3 players: 5 cards  
  - 4 players: 4 cards  
  - 5 players: 3 cards  
- If deck is empty, deal as many as possible. Leader chooses order.  

**Discard Leadership Token (optional)**:  
- Discard 1 token → increase hand limit by 1 for this phase  
- Deal extra card(s) accordingly  
- Effect lasts until next Draw Phase  

#### 5. Rest Phase (optional)  
Leader may choose to take Rest Phase:  
1. Take 1 Leadership token (from discard or Sled)  
2. Move all remaining tokens from discard to Sled Board  
3. Shuffle Equipment discard into new Equipment deck  

**Cannot take Rest Phase** if only 1 Leadership token remains in total (would require returning it to box → lose)  

**End of Turn**:  
- If Airplane is on **third Escape tile** → game ends  
- Else, Leader passes Sled Board to player on left  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Madness Cards**:  
  - Always kept **face down**, known only to owner  
  - Restrict communication during Encounter Phase  
  - Cannot discuss Madness with others  
  - When timer not running, act as if you don’t remember restrictions  
- **Leadership Tokens**:  
  - Critical resource  
  - Used to:  
    - Let players ignore Madness (Movement Phase)  
    - Restart Encounter Phase (after timer)  
    - Reroll Penalty Die (Resolution)  
    - Increase hand size (Draw Phase)  
  - Losing last token → immediate loss  
- **Equipment Cards**:  
  - Types: Tools, Weapons, Books, Crates  
  - Values 2–6 (10 cards per type)  
  - Arcane Equipment: value 10, added during game  
- **Injury Cards**:  
  - Parasitic; clog hand  
  - Can be played during Encounter Phase like Equipment  
  - Return to hand if not healed in Rest Phase  
- **Communication Rules**:  
  - Only allowed during Encounter Phase **before first card is played**  
  - All discussion stops when first card is played  
  - Speaking during silence → Penalty Die roll  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when:  
1. **Escape**: Airplane is on third Escape tile at end of turn  
   - Count:  
     - **Relic cards** in front of players  
     - **Injury cards** in: Injury deck, Equipment discard, all players’ hands  
   - Compare:  
     - If **Relics ≥ Injuries** → **Win**  
     - If **Relics < Injuries** → **Lose**  
2. **Immediate Loss Conditions**:  
   - Last Leadership token returned to box  
   - Must draw Injury card but Injury deck is empty  

Victory table (optional):  
| Relic - Injury | Result |  
|----------------|--------|  
| < 0 | Embarrassed failure |  
| 0 | Barely keep job |  
| 1–3 | Minor academic impact |  
| 4–7 | Famous, tour presentations |  
| 8–10 | Revolutionize science |  
| 11 | Irrefutable proof of prehuman life |  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you have multiple Madness cards?**  
  No, by default. Only one active at a time (higher level replaces lower).  
  *Exception: Expert Variant allows stacking.*  
- **Can you play Injury cards during Encounter Phase?**  
  Yes, like Equipment cards. But they do not contribute to Challenge Values unless specified.  
- **What if multiple players need to draw Madness but all have Level 3?**  
  For each required draw, discard a Leadership token. If no tokens available, return one to box → lose if last one.  
- **Can you use a Relic token to unblock a space?**  
  No. Once placed, it permanently blocks that space on the Player Board.  
- **Can you exceed hand limit?**  
  Yes, if Leadership token was discarded in Draw Phase. But no new cards are drawn until hand ≤ limit.  
- **What happens to played Injury cards?**  
  Discarded. They only return to hand if not healed and no Rest Phase occurred.
