## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players represent the rival Houses of Lancaster and York during the Wars of the Roses. The game simulates political maneuvering, military conflict, and shifting loyalties.

**Victory Conditions:**  
- **Instant Victory:** Eliminate all five enemy heirs.  
- **Campaign Victory:** After three campaigns, the player who is King wins.  
- **Usurpation Victory:** During the Political Turn, if the Pretender controls a majority of nobles, heirs, church blocks, and London, he becomes King and wins if it is the final Political Turn.

### 2. Components  
- Map board with areas, borders, cities, cathedrals, shields, and sea zones  
- Block units:  
  - Heirs (5 per side, ranked 1–5; senior heir is King or Pretender)  
  - Nobles (Rose nobles are permanently loyal; non-Rose nobles have Lancaster/York versions)  
  - Church blocks (Canterbury, York)  
  - City Levies (one per city)  
  - Bombard blocks  
  - Mercenaries (3 per side)  
  - Welsh block (Lancastrian-controlled)  
  - Rebel block (controlled by current Pretender)  
- Player pools and exile areas:  
  - Lancaster: Exile areas = France, Scotland

  - 3 heirs in play, 2 minor heirs off-board  
  - Blocks placed upright at full strength per scenario (e.g., 1460 Full Game)  
- Shuffle 25-card deck; deal 7 cards to each player.

   - Use AP from card for:  
     - **Move** (Land or Sea)

   - Actions may be combined in any order.  

3. **Battle Phase:**

   - Resolve all battles (up to 4 rounds).  
   - Battles may involve both players as attacker or defender in different locations.  

4. **Supply Phase:**  
   - Reduce surplus blocks by one step.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Movement  
- **Land Move:** 1–2 areas per AP. Must stop in enemy or contested area.  
- **Sea Move:**  
  - 1 block per AP: coastal to coastal in same Sea Zone  
  - 2 blocks per AP: between **major ports** (ship symbol)  
  - Units moving by sea cannot move by land same turn  
  - **Cannot Sea Move:** Scots, Welsh, Rebel, City Levy  
  - **Exile Access:**  
    - Lancaster: France (sea), Scotland (land/sea)  
    - York: Calais, Ireland (sea only)

#### Border Limits (per player, per turn)  
- Yellow border: 4 blocks  
- Blue border: 3 blocks  
- Red border: 2 blocks (**must stop**)  
- Applies to movement, retreat, and regroup. Reset each battle round.

#### Recruiting  
- 1 AP to deploy one block from pool at full strength. Cannot move same turn.  
- Placement rules:  
  - **Noble:** Friendly/vacant area with matching shield  
  - **Church:** Friendly/vacant cathedral  
  - **City Levy:** Friendly/vacant home city  
  - **Bombard:** Any friendly city

- **Initiative Order:** A → B → C → D  
  - Defenders act before attackers in each class  
  - **Bombard:** A3 in Round 1; D3 in later rounds (only if in main force)  

- **Reserves:**  
  - Attacker may use up to 3 borders; one is **Main Attack**, others are **Reserves**  
  - Defender may reinforce via up to 2 borders → reserves  
  - Reserves arrive at start of Round 2  
  - **Exception:** If all Round 1 units on a side are eliminated, reserves deploy immediately (can take hits, cannot fire)  

- **Combat Resolution:**  
  - Roll dice = current strength (diamonds)  
  - Hit on roll ≤ firepower (modified by bonuses)  
  - All hits applied to strongest enemy block; surplus to next strongest  
  - Hits reduce strength by 90° counter-clockwise  

- **Combat Bonuses (defending only):**  
  - **Shield:** +1 if noble defends home area  
  - **Crown:** +1 if King or senior royal heir defends area with crown  
  - **City:** +1 if levy defends home city  
  - **Cathedral:** +1 if church defends home cathedral  
  - **Wales:** +1 if Welsh defends in Wales  
  - **Senior Heir Only:** Only one heir per side gains shield/crown bonus if multiple heirs present  

- **Heir Charge:**  
  - Senior heir may **charge** instead of firing  
  - Normal attack on named enemy block (surplus hits lost)  
  - If target survives, it may immediately return fire (bonus attack)  

- **Treachery Roll (once per battle per eligible unit):**  
  - May be used by **King, Warwick, Pretender** instead of firing or retreating  
  - Target: non-reserve enemy block (not Rose noble)  
  - Roll dice = target’s Loyalty Rating  
  - **Defects** if all rolls are even  
  - Defected block joins your side as reserve (same strength)  
  - **Loyalty Ratings:**  
    - Kent, Salisbury: LR 2 (vs King/Pretender), LR 1 (vs Warwick)  
    - Warwick cannot target Northumberland or Westmoreland  
  - **Special Heirs:**  
    - Exeter (Lancaster), Clarence (York) can defect  
    - If they defect: become nobles (not heirs) on new side  
    - Not replaced by minor heir unless executed  
    - Can be executed in Supply Phase  

- **Retreat:**  
  - Allowed from Round 2 onward  
  - To adjacent **friendly or vacant** area  
  - **Cannot retreat across border used by enemy to enter battle**  
  - If both players used same border, only **Player 2** may retreat across it  
  - Eliminated if unable to retreat when required (e.g., attacker in Round 4)  

- **Regroup:**  
  - Victor (last side with blocks in area) may regroup to adjacent friendly/vacant areas  
  - Border limits apply  
  - Only **Piracy Event** allows sea regroup

#### Political Turn (after 7th Game Turn)  
1. **Disband:**  
   - Levies, Bombards, Welsh → owner’s pool  
   - Mercenaries → home areas  
   - Rebel → Pretender’s pool  
2. **Usurpation Check:**  
   - Count: nobles + heirs + church blocks (each = 1) + 1 if Pretender holds London  
   - Exclude blocks in exile, Isle of Man  
   - If Pretender has **majority**, his senior heir becomes King; former King becomes Pretender  
3. **Pretender Goes Home:**  
   - Pretender and heirs → exile  
   - Nobles/church → home shield/cathedral; if occupied → pool  
   - **Kent, Salisbury (Yorkist):** May go to Calais if shields occupied  
   - **Nevilles:** May use each other’s shields if owner dead  
4. **King Goes Home:**  
   - King and royal heirs → shield or any crown  
   - Nobles/church → home; if occupied → pool  
5. **Campaign Reset:**  
   - Over-stacked exile areas: surplus to pool  
   - All face-down blocks in pool → face up  
   - Rebel → Pretender pool  
   - All blocks (map and pool) → full strength  
   - Shuffle deck, deal 7 cards → next campaign

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Instant Victory:** Eliminate all 5 enemy heirs at any time  
- **Final Victory:** After 3 campaigns, whoever is **King** wins
