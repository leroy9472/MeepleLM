### 1. Lore & Objective  
Code 777 is a deduction game where players attempt to be the first to correctly guess the three hidden tiles on their own rack. Each tile features a number (1–7), a color (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Pink, Brown, Black), and a shape (◆, ▲, ●, ■, +, ◆, ★). Players use logic and information gathered from asking and answering question cards to deduce their secret code.

The objective is to be the first player to correctly guess all three tiles (number, color, and shape) on your rack.

### 2. Components  
- 49 unique tiles (7 numbers × 7 colors/shapes)
- 4 player racks (each holds 3 tiles)
- 23 Question Cards (numbered 1–23)
- Notepad with tracking sheets (including number pyramids and question log)
- Draw pile and out-of-play area

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Place all tiles face down and shuffle thoroughly.
2. Each player draws 3 tiles randomly and places them on their rack without looking.
3. Place the remaining tiles face down as the draw pile.
4. Place one tile from the draw pile onto each of the other racks (non-player racks). With fewer than 4 players:
   - 3 players: 1 unoccupied rack
   - 2 players: 2 unoccupied racks
5. Give each player a notepad for tracking information.
6. Shuffle the 23 Question Cards and place them face down in a deck.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Start**: Oldest player goes first; play proceeds clockwise.
2. **On Your Turn**:
   a. **Ask a Question**: Draw the top Question Card and read it aloud. All other players answer truthfully based on what they can see (i.e., all racks except their own).
   b. **Record Answers**: All players may take notes using the notepad.
   c. **Optional Guess**: After receiving answers, you may attempt to guess your code.
      - If correct: You win immediately.
      - If incorrect: Reveal nothing. Your turn ends.
   d. **Refresh Racks**:
      - Replace any guessed tiles (correct or incorrect) with new tiles from the draw pile.
      - For games with <4 players, also refresh unoccupied racks after a correct guess.
3. **Draw Pile Refresh**:
   - When only **one tile remains** in the draw pile during a refresh:
     - Collect all out-of-play tiles.
     - Shuffle them with the last tile to form a new draw pile.
   - Variant: Reshuffle at 4 or 7 tiles remaining for increased difficulty.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Deduction**: Use visible tiles on others’ racks and answers to question cards to eliminate possibilities.
- **Question Cards**:
  - Each card asks a specific observational or comparative question about visible tiles.
  - Answers must be truthful but limited to what the card asks—no extra information.
  - Examples:
    - *Card #1*: "On how many racks is the sum of the numbers 18 or more?"
    - *Card #5*: "On how many racks do you see only even or only odd numbers?"  
      (Even: 2, 4, 6; Odd: 1, 3, 5, 7)
    - *Card #11*: "How many of the following do you see: Green 1, Black 5, Pink 7?" → Answer: 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    - *Card #16*: "Do you see more Blue 7s or more 7s of a different color?" → Total all Blue 7s vs. Yellow + Pink 7s.
- **Tie Answers**: If a question asks “more X or more Y” and both are zero, answer: “I see the same number.”
- **Notepad Use**:
  - Mark off tiles you see on other racks in the pyramid chart (you cannot have those).
  - Use different marks for deduced absences.
  - Start a new pyramid after each reshuffle.
  - Use left-side numbers (1–23) to log question answers; start a new column after reshuffle.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is **no scoring system**.
- The game ends **immediately** when a player correctly guesses their full code (all three tiles: number, color, shape).
- A player may guess only **once per turn**, and only after asking a question.
- If a player guesses incorrectly, the game continues. They gain no information and their turn ends.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: If I guess correctly, do I get to see my tiles?**  
  A: Yes. You may confirm and record your code definitively.

- **Q: If I guess incorrectly, do I see my tiles?**  
  A: No. You learn nothing and must continue deducing.

- **Q: What happens when the draw pile is exhausted?**  
  A: When only **one tile remains** during a refresh, immediately reshuffle all out-of-play tiles (including that last one) into a new draw pile.

- **Q: Do all players reset their notes when tiles are reshuffled?**  
  A: Effectively yes. Since the draw pile is refreshed with previously played tiles, prior visibility info becomes outdated. Players should start a new pyramid and question log column.

- **Q: Can I ask the same question twice?**  
  A: Yes, if the card reappears after a reshuffle or through deck cycling.

- **Q: Are there duplicate tiles?**  
  A: No. Each tile (number + color/shape) is **unique**. If you see a Green 1, no one else can have it.
