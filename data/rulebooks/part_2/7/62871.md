# ZOMBI DICE — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
You are a zombie hunting humans to eat their brains. Each die represents a human victim. The goal is to be the first to reach 13 brains (or 20 in the Zombie Horde variant), while avoiding being shot by victims. After one player reaches the target, all players complete an equal number of turns. The player with the most brains wins. Ties are broken with a single tiebreaker round among the leaders.

### 2. Components
- 13 Dice (6 Green, 4 Yellow, 3 Red)
- 1 Cup
- Optional Dice (from expansions):
  - Hunk Die (Hero)
  - Hottie Die (Hero)
  - Santa Die
  - School Bus Die
  - Zombie Horde Die (unofficial)
- Scorekeeping tools (e.g., scorepad, counters)

Dice Distribution:
- Green Dice (6): Easiest — more Brains
- Yellow Dice (4): Medium — balanced
- Red Dice (3): Hardest — more Shotguns

### 3. Setup
- Place all 13 standard dice in the cup.
- Optional Expansions:
  - **Zombie Dice 2 (Double Feature)**:
    - Replace one Yellow die with Hunk Die.
    - Replace one Yellow die with Hottie Die.
    - Replace one Green die with Santa Die.
  - **Zombie Dice 3 (School Bus)**:
    - Place School Bus Die outside the cup. It does not replace any die and is used in addition.
  - **Zombie Horde (Unofficial)**:
    - Add Zombie Horde Die to the game. Do not replace any die. Play to 20 brains instead of 13.
- Determine first player: winner of last game or best “Braaaaains!” impression.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn:
1. **First Roll**:
   - Draw 3 random dice from the cup.
   - Roll them.
2. **Resolve Roll**:
   - **Brain**: Set aside. Score 1 point (per Brain) if turn ends safely.
   - **Shotgun**: Set aside. Collect 3 Shotguns = turn ends, score 0.
   - **Footprints**: Keep in front. May be re-rolled.
3. **Decision**:
   - **Stop**: Score all Brains set aside this turn (if not killed). End turn.
   - **Continue**: Re-roll all Footprints + draw enough new dice from cup to total 3.
     - If fewer than 3 dice in cup:
       - Note current Brain count.
       - Return all Brain dice to cup.
       - Keep Shotguns aside.
       - Continue with remaining Footprints and new dice.
     - Once you commit to drawing new dice, you must roll — no stopping mid-process.
4. **Turn End Conditions**:
   - You stop voluntarily.
   - You roll 3 Shotguns (or 4 if wearing Helmet).
   - You roll STOP SIGN (School Bus Die).
   - You run out of dice and cannot continue.

  - Santa not returned to cup if <3 dice in cup.
- **School Bus Substitution**:
