## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Red November is a cooperative board game set aboard a malfunctioning submarine crewed by inebriated gnomes. Players must work together to prevent disasters—fire, flooding, reactor meltdown, engine failure, oxygen loss, missile launch, and a kraken attack—before time runs out. The objective is to survive long enough for all players’ Time Keepers (TKs) to reach the "Rescued!" space on the Time Track. The game is lost if any Disaster Track marker reaches its end, a Destruction token is not prevented in time, or all gnomes die.

### 2. Components  
- Game board showing submarine layout and Disaster Tracks (Asphyxiation, Heat, Pressure)  
- Time Track with spaces for Time Keeper (TK) markers  
- 6 Gnome figures and corresponding TK markers and Gnome cards (sober/intoxicated sides)  
- Disaster track markers  
- Tokens: Fire, Low Water, High Water, Blocked Hatch, Destruction (Asphyxiated!, Crushed!, Missiles Launched!, Devoured by a Kraken!)  
- Item tiles (54 total):  
  - 1× Coffee, 12× Grog, 3× Toolbox, 4× Engine Manual, 4× Pump Manual, 4× Reactor Manual,  
  - 3× Deactivation Code, 6× Crowbar, 5× Fire Extinguisher, 6× Water Pump, 2× Aqualung, 2× Harpoon, 2× Lucky Charm  
- Event cards (56 total):  
  - 8× Fire, 3× Fire Spread, 2× Stumble, 1× Friendly Fire, 8× Hatch Blocked, 2× Leak,  
  - 8× Respite, 6× Reactor Warmup, 2× Reactor Malfunction, 1× Kraken, 6× Descent,  
  - 1× Fast Descent, 2× Missile Countdown, 1× Underwater Current, 1× Oxygen Pumps Down,  
  - 1× Overheated, 1× Engine Down, 2× Turbulence  
- Ghost TK (white marker)  
- 1× Six-sided die  

### 3. Setup  
1. Assemble the board and place each Disaster Track marker on the leftmost space of its track.  
2. Each player chooses a color and takes the matching Gnome figure, TK, and Gnome card (sober side up).  
3. Roll a die to randomly place each Gnome in a room (1–6 correspond to rooms 1–6).  
4. Place TKs in random stacked order on the starting space (based on player count).  
5. Separate 6 Grog tiles and place them face up near the Captain’s Cabin. Shuffle the remaining item tiles and deal 2 to each player.  
6. Set aside the Kraken event card. Shuffle the remaining Event cards and place them face down as the Event deck.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in order of their TK positions, with the player whose TK is furthest back going first. If TKs are stacked, the top player goes first. Each turn follows this sequence:

#### 1. Movement  
- Place the Ghost TK on top of the active player’s TK.  
- The player may perform the following in any order and as many times as desired:  
  - **Open a hatch** (1 min): Opens a non-blocked hatch. Blocked hatches must be unblocked first (via action).  
  - **Reflow water** (0 min): If one room has High Water and the adjacent room has no water, both become Low Water. If a flooded room has a Fire token, remove the Fire.  
  - **Enter a room** (0–1 min): Move into an adjacent room through an open hatch.  
  - **Leave the sub** (1 min): Only possible via an exterior hatch with an Aqualung tile.  

#### 2. Action  
The player chooses one of the following actions:

##### Fix-It Actions  
- **Unblock Hatch**: Spend 1–10 minutes + modifiers. Success removes one Blocked Hatch token from a connected hatch.  
- **Extinguish Fire**: Required if in a burning room. Success removes Fire token. Failure requires a move out; inability to move results in death.  
- **Pump Water**: Available if in a room with Low Water. Success removes the token.  

##### Room-Specific Fix Actions (must be in correct room):  
- **Fix Engine** (Room 1): Resets Pressure Track and prevents Crushed!  
- **Fix Oxygen Pumps** (Room 2): Resets Asphyxiation Track and prevents Asphyxiated!  
- **Fix Reactor** (Room 4): Resets Heat Track and prevents Overheated/Meltdown  
- **Stop Missile Launch** (Missile Control): Prevents Missiles Launched!  
- **Kill Kraken** (outside sub): Prevents Devoured by a Kraken!  

##### Item Actions  
- **Draw Items**:  
  - In **Equipment Stores**: Spend up to 4 min drawing from facedown pile (1 min per item).  
  - In **Captain’s Cabin**: Spend up to 2 min drawing Grog (1 min per tile).  
  - Cannot draw again until performing an action in a different room.  
- **Trade Items**: With another gnome in the same room. Active player gives any number, then receives any number. Costs 1 min.  
- **No Action**: Spend 1 min doing nothing.  

All items are discarded when used. When pile is exhausted, shuffle discards to form a new pile.

#### 3. Faint Check  
- If the player used one or more Grog tiles during the turn, draw an Event card and check the Faint Number:  
  - “—”: automatic pass.  
  - Number ≤ current intoxication level: gnome passes out.  
- Place gnome figure on its side. Move Ghost TK forward 10 additional spaces.  
- Intoxication level increases by 1 per Grog used (max 4).  
- Gnome wakes on next turn (still passed out if intoxication high).  

#### 4. Updates  
- Move the player’s TK forward to meet the Ghost TK.  
- Stop at each Event marker: draw and resolve an Event card.  
- Stop at each Draw Items marker: draw one item tile.  
- If both markers coincide, resolve Event first.  
- If Event deck is exhausted, shuffle discards. **First reshuffle adds the Kraken card.**  
- If a fainted gnome is in a room with High Water or Fire during Updates, they die immediately.  
- If active gnome both starts and ends turn outside sub, they die.  
- Remove dead gnome’s figure and TK. If active player dies, remove Ghost TK and skip remaining Events.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Situational Modifiers  
- **On Fire**: Only action allowed is Extinguish Fire.  
- **Low Water**: All actions except Pump Water and No Action cost +2 min.  
- **High Water**: Only action allowed is No Action.  

#### Disaster & Destruction Tracks  
- Disaster Tracks (Asphyxiation, Heat, Pressure) advance due to events. If a marker reaches the end, game is lost.  
- Destruction tokens (Asphyxiated!, Crushed!, etc.) appear on Time Track. If all TKs pass one, it cannot be prevented.  
- Fixing the corresponding system resets both the Disaster Track (to next ★) and removes the Destruction token.  

#### Time Mechanics  
- Ghost TK tracks movement/action time.  
- TKs move only during Updates.  
- Abandon Comrades: After a player’s TK passes 10, they may attempt to escape. If they reach the sea (with Aqualung), they use all remaining minutes. If others lose, escaper wins. If others win, escaper loses.  

#### Room Events (from Event Cards)  
- **Fire**: Select a room. If not flooded, add Fire token and advance Asphyxiation Track.  
- **Fire Spread**: Active player chooses adjacent non-burning, non-flooded room to catch fire.  
- **Blocked Hatch**: Player selects any non-blocked hatch adjacent to a room (not exterior).  
- **Flood**: Random room gains High Water; any Fire there is extinguished.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Lose Conditions (immediate loss)**:  
  - Any Disaster Track marker reaches end.  
  - All TKs pass a Destruction token without preventing it.  
  - All gnomes die.  
- **Win Condition**:  
  - All surviving players’ TKs reach the "Rescued!" space **and** all Events have been resolved.  
- **Abandon Comrades Outcome**:  
  - Escaper wins only if others lose. If others win, escaper loses.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you open a hatch from a burning room?** Yes. Movement actions (like opening hatches) are allowed. Unblocking is an action and cannot be done from such rooms.  
- **Can you move through a burning room?** Yes, with Grog or Fire Extinguisher, even to perform another action—but you die after if you stay.  
- **Can you extinguish fire without items?** Yes, if already in the room when it catches fire.  
- **Fainting outside sub?** Yes, the gnome dies.  
- **Water flow:** Only between High Water and No Water rooms. Opening hatch → both become Low Water. Fire in flooded room is extinguished.  
- **Multiple items?** Yes, can play multiple items (e.g., 2 Grog → +2 intoxication, one faint check).  
- **Intoxication cap:** Level 4 is max, but can keep drinking and must still faint check.  
- **Event on fainting:** Yes, draw Events and items for every space the Ghost TK moves during faint.  
- **Two-player variant:** Each player controls 2 gnomes. Ignore Abandon Comrades rule.  
- **Item visibility:** Optional. Hidden creates paranoia; open fosters cooperation.  
- **Using items out of turn?** No. Only during own turn, before affected die rolls.  
- **Fixing a system past reset point?** Yes. Fix once to reach ★, fix again to go below.  
- **Timing of +10/+15 from events:** Starts from the space where the event occurred.
