# PUNCT — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
PUNCT is the fifth game in the GIPF project, designed for two players. It explores the human spirit, the blend of conscious and subconscious thought, divine inspiration, and the courage to create. The game is about connecting opposing sides through strategy, interpretation, and personal expression.

The primary goal is to connect two opposite sides of the hexagonal board with a continuous chain of your colored dots (from your pieces), regardless of level. If no player achieves this, a secondary objective determines the winner based on control of the central hexagon.

### 2. Components
- 1 game board (hexagonal grid)
- 18 white pieces (each with 3 dots: 1 colored "PUNCT" and 2 minor dots)
- 18 black pieces (same structure as white)
- 1 white PUNCT-marking piece (single-dot round marker)
- 1 black PUNCT-marking piece (same)
- 1 fabric bag
- Rulebook (multiple languages)

Each player’s 18 pieces consist of:
- 6 straight pieces
- 6 angular (corner-shaped) pieces
- 6 triangular pieces

### 3. Setup
1. Place the board between the two players with its long edge (lettered side) running from player to player.
2. Randomly determine who plays white; white moves first.
3. Each player places their 18 pieces in front of them, visible to both players.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn, you must choose one of the following actions:
- **Add a new piece** to the board (from your supply)
- **Move an existing piece** already on the board

If moving a piece, you have two sub-options:
- Move it to another location on the board
- Jump it on top of other pieces (possibly forming a bridge)

Each turn may also include rotating the piece after movement.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Adding a Piece
1. Choose any of your unused pieces and place it flat on the board (level 1).
2. The piece must fully occupy three adjacent spaces—each dot covers one space.
3. **Restriction (Standard Game only)**: No new piece may be placed directly in or partially overlapping the central hexagon.
4. **Exception (Basic Game)**: Only the first player’s first move is restricted from the central hexagon; all other placements are free.

#### Moving a Piece
1. Only your own colored pieces can be moved.
2. Movement is determined by the **PUNCT** (colored dot):
   - The PUNCT must move in a straight line (any number of spaces).
   - It can move over any terrain, including other pieces and into/out of the central hexagon.
3. **PUNCT-Marking Piece**:
   - Optional aid: remove the piece you want to move and place your PUNCT-marker on the space where its PUNCT was.
   - This helps visualize movement paths.
   - Must be removed after the move is completed.
4. **Rotation**:
   - After moving (but before placing it down), you may rotate the piece around its PUNCT.
   - The PUNCT remains fixed in space during rotation; only the minor dots move.
   - You may rotate without moving, or move without rotating—both count as a full turn.
5. Edge Rule: If moving a piece to the edge, rotate it so all three dots stay within the board.

#### Jumping on Other Pieces
To place a piece on top of others:
1. Move the PUNCT in a straight line to land **on one of your own pieces** (on either a PUNCT or minor dot).
2. After landing, you may rotate the piece so its minor dots cover any reachable dots (own or opponent’s).
3. **Blocking Rule**:
   - Any dot covered (by any piece) is blocked.
   - A piece with at least one blocked dot cannot be moved or rotated.
4. **Level Independence**:
   - No limit on height; pieces can jump multiple levels up or down.
   - A piece on top of a stack can later be moved back to the board level.
5. **Top Priority Rule**: Upper pieces have precedence. You can break an opponent’s connection by jumping on their pieces.

#### Making a Bridge
1. Only **straight** and **angular** pieces can form bridges (triangular pieces cannot).
2. A bridge is formed when the two end dots of the piece rest on two separate pieces at the same level, allowing the middle dot (PUNCT or minor) to span empty space.
3. The piece must be placed via a jump (i.e., it must be a piece already on the board).
4. The PUNCT must still move in a straight line and land on one of your own pieces.
5. **Stability Requirements**:
   - The two supporting pieces must be at the same level.
   - Only the middle dot may be unsupported; end dots must be supported.
6. **Blocking Under Bridges**:
   - Any dot directly under the middle of a bridge is blocked, even if not physically touched.
   - Empty spaces under a bridge are also blocked—no piece may be slid underneath.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends immediately when one player connects two opposite sides.

**Winning Conditions**:
- **Primary**: First to connect two opposite sides wins.
  - Connection is valid if:
    - Dots (PUNCT or minor) of the same color occupy adjacent spaces (any level).
    - All dots in the chain are visible from above.
    - The chain runs from any space on one side to any space on the opposite side.
    - No distinction between PUNCT and minor dots in a connection.
- **Secondary (Tie-breaker, Standard Game only)**:
  - If neither player connects two sides when the last piece is placed, the player who controls the most dots in the central hexagon wins.
  - Control = number of your colored dots visible from above in the central hexagon.
  - If tied, the game is a draw.

**Draw Condition (Basic Game)**: If the last piece is placed and no connection exists, the game ends in a draw.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I rotate a piece without moving it?**  
  Yes. This counts as a full turn.

- **Can I move a piece and not rotate it?**  
  Yes. Movement without rotation is allowed.

- **Can I cover my own dots?**  
  Yes, but doing so blocks those dots and may immobilize your own pieces.

- **Can I jump onto opponent’s pieces?**  
  Only with minor dots. The **PUNCT must land on your own piece**.

- **Can a bridge support another piece?**  
  Yes, as long as the supporting dots are occupied and stable.

- **Can I look under stacked pieces?**  
  Yes. You may lift one piece at a time to inspect the state underneath. Never lift more than one.

- **Can a triangular piece be used as a bridge?**  
  No. It must always rest on all three dots.

- **What happens if a piece is immobilized?**  
  It cannot be moved or rotated until all its dots are unblocked.

- **Does the central hexagon restriction apply in the Basic Game?**  
  Only for the first player’s first move. After that, free placement.

- **Can I place a new piece on top of others?**  
  No. All new pieces must be placed on the board level (level 1).
