## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Not specified in source material.

2. Components  
- 54 Playing Cards  
- Tiles (3 types):  
  - Oasis [grass]  
  - Steppe [straw]  
  - Stony Plains [stone]  
- Scoring Markers (4 types, represented as wide tiles):  
  - Commodity [red]  
  - Water Well [grass with a pond]  
  - Horse [straw with a quadruped]  
  - Ovoos [stone]  
- Priority Counters (numbered 1 to n, where n = number of players)  
- Board with:  
  - Permanent bonus spaces (Oasis, Steppe, Stony Plains)  
  - Camel Path (straw-colored edge)  
  - Play area with grid for tile placement  
- Scoring Track  

3. Setup  
- Place one stack of each Tile type (Oasis, Steppe, Stony Plains) next to the board.  
- Place one stack of each Scoring Marker type (Commodity, Water Well, Horse, Ovoos) next to the board.  
- Prepare Priority Counters: one per player, numbered 1 to n (n = player count).  
- Shuffle the 54-card deck to form the Draw Deck.  
- Each player:  
  - Randomly receives one Priority Counter, placed face-up.  
  - Receives 5 cards face-down as their initial Offer Stack.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
A round consists of two phases: Offer Phase and Acceptance Phase.

**Phase 1: Offer Phase (in Priority Order, #1 first)**  
Each player:  
- Reveals 1 to 3 cards (o = 1, 2, or 3) from the top of their Offer Stack to create an offer.  
- Must leave at least 1 card in the Offer Stack after revealing.  
- Then, takes the top (3 − o) cards from the Draw Deck and places them face-down under their Offer Stack.  
  - If the Draw Deck is empty, shuffle the Discard Pile to form a new Draw Deck.  

**Phase 2: Acceptance Phase (in Priority Order, #1 first)**  
Each player, in order:  
- Must accept one remaining offer (can accept their own if no others remain).  
- Gives their Priority Counter to the player whose offer they accept; the counter is kept face-down by the recipient.  
- Takes all cards from the accepted offer.  
- Resolves the cards in any order, according to their types:  
  - **Camels**: Place the shown number of Camels on the Camel Path.  
  - **Tile(s)**: Take the shown number of Tiles of the specified type and place them on the board (not on the Camel Path).  
    - Tiles cannot be placed such that they connect to your already-controlled area of the same type.  
    - You may start a new area with the tile.  
    - You may only place or move a Control Marker onto a tile you just placed.  
    - If placing a tile creates a fifth area of a type, you may move one of your existing control markers to the new tile.  
  - **Scoring Marker(s)**: Take the shown number of the specified Scoring Marker and place them face-down in front of you.  
  - **Cards**: Take the shown number of cards from the top of the Draw Deck and place them face-down under your Offer Stack.  
    - Replenish from Discard Pile if needed (after shuffle).  
- After all players have accepted, all Priority Counters are turned face-up.  

**Free Action (Player #1 only)**  
After resolution, Player #1 (current round leader) may take **one** free action:  
- Place one Tile on the board (following placement rules), OR  
- Place one Camel on the Camel Path.  

End of Round.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Priority Order**: Determined by face-up Priority Counters at start of each phase. The player with #1 acts first.  
- **Offer Stack Management**:  
  - Must always contain at least 1 card.  
  - Cards may only be viewed when revealed as part of an offer.  
- **Tile Placement Rules**:  
  - Adjacency is orthogonal only (no diagonals).  
  - A tile may not be placed to connect to your own controlled area of the same type.  
  - You may start a new area with any placed tile.  
  - Control Markers can only be placed or moved to a tile you just placed.  
  - If you would create a fifth area of a tile type, you may reposition one of your control markers to the new tile.  
- **Scoring Markers**:  
  - Kept face-down; may be viewed at any time by owner.  
- **Draw Deck Management**:  
  - When depleted, shuffle the Discard Pile to form a new Draw Deck.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Conditions**  
The game ends at the end of the round if **either** of the following occurs:  
- All tiles of **one** type (Oasis, Steppe, or Stony Plains) have been placed on the board.  
- A player accepts an offer containing a Tile that cannot be legally placed (unplayable Tile).  

**Final Setup for Scoring**  
- Each player places one of their Camels or Control Markers on the scoring track at position 0.  

**Scoring**  
Each player scores:  
- **Camel Score**:  
  $ c \times s_c $  
  - $ c $: size of largest contiguous group of their Camels on the Camel Path (orthogonal adjacency only).  
  - $ s_c $: number of Commodity Scoring Markers they possess.  
- **Tile Control Scores** (for each tile type):  
  $ t \times s_t $  
  - $ t $: total number of that tile type they control.  
  - $ s_t $: number of corresponding Scoring Markers:  
    - Oasis ↔ Water Well  
    - Steppe ↔ Horse  
    - Stony Plains ↔ Ovoos  

**Total Score** = Sum of Camel Score and all Tile Control Scores.  

**Tiebreaker**:  
Lower-numbered Priority Counter wins.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I look at my Scoring Markers?**  
  A: Yes, at any time.  

- **Q: Can I pass on accepting an offer?**  
  A: No. You must accept one remaining offer, even if it's your own.  

- **Q: What if I can’t place a Tile from an offer?**  
  A: If the Tile is unplayable due to placement rules, and you accept such an offer, the game ends at the end of the round.  

- **Q: Can I place a tile adjacent to another player’s same-type area?**  
  A: Yes, as long as it doesn’t connect to your own controlled area of that type.  

- **Q: When can I move a Control Marker?**  
  A: Only when you place a tile — you may move one of your control markers to the newly placed tile, especially if forming a fifth area.  

- **Q: What happens to Priority Counters after they’re given away?**  
  A: The recipient keeps them face-down. At the end of the round, all are turned face-up to determine next round’s order.
