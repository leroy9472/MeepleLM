### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Boss Monster*, players take on the role of villainous Boss Monsters competing to lure, trap, and slay heroic adventurers. The goal is to accumulate 10 Souls by killing Heroes in your dungeon while avoiding 5 Wounds from Heroes who survive and attack you.

### 2. Components
- Boss Cards  
- Room Cards (Ordinary and Advanced)  
- Spell Cards  
- Hero Cards (Ordinary and Epic)  
- Item Cards (in expansions)  
- Miniboss Cards (in expansions)  
- Coins (in expansions)  
- Tokens (e.g., +1 damage, Wound, Soul)  
- Discard Pile  

### 3. Setup
- Shuffle and deal one Boss card randomly to each player.  
- Set up Room, Spell, Hero, and Epic Hero decks.  
- Each player draws 5 Room and 2 Spell cards, then discards 2 cards.  
- Each player places one Room card face down to the left of their Boss.  
- Simultaneously reveal all starting Rooms. Resolve "When you build this Room" effects in XP order.  
- For games with Items: reveal Items before Heroes at the start of each turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
**1. Beginning of Turn**  
- Reveal one Hero per player (in order: all Ordinary before Epic).  
- Each player draws one Room card.  
- (With Items) Reveal and attach Items to matching Heroes.

**2. Build Phase**  
- Players act in XP order:  
  - May play Build-phase Spells or activate abilities.  
  - May place one Room face down (adjacent to dungeon or over existing Room).  
  - Non-active players may react with Build Spells/abilities (active player resolves first).  
- After all players act, simultaneously reveal face-down Rooms.  
- Resolve Level Up effects and "When you build this Room" effects in XP order. No Spells may be played during this resolution.

**3. Bait Phase**  
- For each Hero in Town (FIFO order):  
  - Each player totals treasure icons matching the Hero's type.  
  - Hero moves to dungeon entrance with highest treasure value.  
  - If tied or zero, Hero remains in Town.

**4. Adventure Phase**  
- Players act in XP order:  
  - For each Hero at dungeon entrance (in arrival order):  
    - Hero moves through each Room left to right.  
    - In each Room: apply Hero/Item abilities → Room ongoing effects → Room damage.  
    - After damage, any player may play Adventure Spells or abilities (active player has priority).  
    - If damage ≥ Health, Hero dies (placed face down in scoring area = Soul).  
    - If Hero survives all Rooms, it reaches Boss (placed face up = Wound).  
- Repeat for all players, even those without Heroes.

**5. End of Turn Phase**  
- Resolve "until end of turn" effects.  
- Reactivate deactivated Rooms (turn upright).  
- Remove damage from surviving Heroes.  
- Check win/loss conditions.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Treasure Types**: Fighter (Red), Thief (Gray), Cleric (Light Gray), Mage (Blue), Explorer (Green). Determines Hero attraction.  
- **Room Building**:  
  - Ordinary Rooms: may be built anywhere (adjacent or on top of any Room).  
  - Advanced Rooms: must match at least one treasure type of the Room underneath.  
- **Room Stacks**: When a Room is destroyed, the Room beneath is revealed (does not trigger "When you build" effects).  
- **Active Player Priority**: During Build and Adventure phases, the active player resolves effects first. Non-active players may react, but active player’s effects resolve first.  
- **Phases for Spells**:  
  - Hammer (Build): Played during Build Phase, before Rooms revealed.  
  - Axe (Adventure): Played during Adventure Phase, after Room damage.  
  - Both: Either phase.  
- **Minibosses** (expansion):  
  - Built face down over a Room.  
  - Pay 1 Coin to reveal (Level 1 ability active).  
  - Pay 1 Coin to promote (Level 2).  
  - Pay 1 Coin to use Level 3 ability (resets to Level 1).  
- **Deactivate**: Turn Room sideways. No damage, treasure, or abilities. Reactivated at end of turn.  
- **Destroy**: Send Room to discard pile. Reveal Room beneath. Gaps close by sliding left.  
- **Priority & Timing**:  
  - No Spells during Beginning of Turn, Bait, or End of Turn phases.  
  - No Spells after Rooms are revealed (during effect resolution).  
  - Heroes pause in each Room: no interruption between ability → effect → damage.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Souls**: Face-down Heroes in scoring area. Ordinary = 1 Soul, Epic = 2 Souls.  
- **Wounds**: Face-up Heroes in scoring area. Ordinary = 1 Wound, Epic = 2 Wounds.  
- **Win Condition**: End a turn with 10 or more Souls and fewer than 5 Wounds.  
- **Loss Condition**: End a turn with 5 or more Wounds (lose regardless of Souls).  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  - If multiple players meet win/loss: subtract Wounds from Souls; highest net score wins.  
  - If still tied: lowest XP wins.  
- **Multiplayer (5–6 players)**: First to 10 Souls ends the game; highest (Souls – Wounds) wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Destroyed Room with Hero**: Hero exits immediately, moves to next Room (if survives). Damage from revealed Room underneath does not apply.  
- **Room Built Over Miniboss**: Miniboss attaches to new top Room.  
- **Miniboss on Destroyed Room**: If only one Room with Miniboss, Miniboss is discarded.  
- **Hero Damage Below Zero**: Track negative Health within Room; effects may still save Hero before exit.  
- **T.P.K. Spell**: Remains in scoring area. Grants +2 Souls when you have at least one face-down Hero of each type.  
- **Teleportation Spell**: Hero keeps damage, returns to first Room, continues movement.  
- **Cave-In**: Destroys a Room; does not trigger its "Destroy this Room" ability.  
- **No Target for Spell**: If target is destroyed before resolution, Spell is canceled.  
- **Simultaneous Effects**: Resolve in XP order (highest first).  
- **Discard Effects**: Player chooses unless "random" is specified. Opponent chooses for random discard.  
- **Hero Sequence**: FIFO in Town; returning Heroes go to end of line.
