## Reiner Knizia's MASTERS GALLERY – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Masters Gallery*, players are art critics and gallery owners vying to assemble the most valuable collection of masterpieces by five renowned artists: Vermeer, Degas, Monet, Renoir, and Van Gogh. Over four rounds, the relative value of each artist’s work fluctuates based on player actions. The goal is to anticipate shifting market trends and score the highest total point value from displayed artworks.

### 2. Components  
- 5 Artist Cards (Vermeer, Degas, Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh)  
- 95 Masterpiece Cards (17 Vermeer, 18 Degas, 19 Monet, 20 Renoir, 21 Van Gogh)  
- 12 Value Tokens (four each of values 1, 2, and 3)  
- 5 Award Tokens (each worth 2 points when active)  
- Pen and paper (required for scoring; not included)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the five Artist Cards in a row in this order:  
   **Vermeer (17), Degas (18), Monet (19), Renoir (20), Van Gogh (21)** — numbers indicate card counts per artist.  
2. Set all Value Tokens and Award Tokens aside.  
3. Shuffle the Masterpiece Cards.  
4. Deal **13 cards** to each player.  
5. Place the remaining deck face-down to the right of the Artist Cards.  
6. Reveal one card from the top of the deck and place it face-up to the right of the deck — this is the **"extra card"** and counts toward round-ending totals.  
7. Choose a starting player for Round 1.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **four rounds**. Each round proceeds as follows:

1. Players take turns clockwise, starting with the designated player.  
2. On a turn, a player selects one Masterpiece Card from their hand and **displays it face-up** in front of them, grouping cards by artist.  
3. If the card has a **symbol**, follow its special action immediately.  
4. After resolving the card, play passes to the next player.  
5. A round ends when **six** (or **five** in a 2-player game) total Masterpiece Cards of **one artist** have been displayed — including those played by players and the "extra card".  
6. If the card that reaches this threshold has a symbol, the round ends **immediately**, and the symbol is **ignored**.  
7. Players with no cards left do not participate further in the round.  
8. If all players exhaust their hands before a round ends, the round ends immediately.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Special Card Symbols (one per artist unless noted):  
- **Draw One Card**: Draw a card from the deck.  
- **Play a Second Card (Face-Up)**: Immediately play a second card of the **same artist**, face-up. Ignore any symbol on the second card.  
- **Play a Second Card (Face-Down)**: Immediately play a second card of **any artist** face-down in front of you. Ignore any symbol on the second card.  
- **Simultaneous Play**: All players choose a card from their hand. Reveal and play them **simultaneously**. Ignore symbols on these cards.  
- **Place One Award Token**: Take an Award Token and place it on **any one Artist Card** of your choice.

#### Scoring a Round  
1. All **face-down cards** played during the round are revealed and added to their respective artist groups.  
2. Determine the **top three artists** by total displayed Masterpiece Cards (including the "extra card").  
3. Assign Value Tokens:  
   - **3** → Artist with most cards  
   - **2** → Second-most  
   - **1** → Third-most  
   - **Ties**: Broken in favor of the artist with the **lower number** (Vermeer=17, Degas=18, etc.)  
4. For each of the top three artists, calculate the **value per card** as:  
   **Sum of Value Tokens + Award Tokens** currently on or next to the Artist Card.  
   (Tokens from previous rounds remain and affect value.)  
5. Players calculate their score:  
   - For each artist they displayed cards for (among the top three), sum:  
     **(Number of cards) × (Value per card)**  
   - Starting with the player who **ended the round**, then clockwise, each player **may play one additional card per different artist** they displayed (i.e., one card for each unique artist in their display). These cards are scored immediately in the same way.  
6. Record each player’s total for the round.  
7. Discard all displayed Masterpiece Cards.  
8. Move the **three Value Tokens** onto the Artist Cards they were assigned to (they remain for future rounds).  
9. Discard the current "extra card".  
10. Reveal a **new "extra card"** from the top of the deck.  
11. Refill hands:  
    - Players draw cards from the deck to return to **13 cards** in hand.  
    - (The rules reference a chart, but none is provided; standard refilling to 13 is implied.)

#### Starting a New Round  
- The player to the **left** of the one who ended the previous round starts the next round.  
- Value and Award Tokens **remain on Artist Cards** and contribute to scoring in future rounds — but only if the artist finishes in the top three that round.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends after **four rounds** have been scored.  
- The player with the **highest total score** (sum of all round scores) wins.  
- In case of a tie, the tied player with the most cards played in the final round wins. If still tied, shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What happens to Award Tokens after scoring?**  
  They remain on the Artist Cards and continue to add value in future rounds.

- **Do Value Tokens move between rounds?**  
  Yes. After scoring, the Value 3, 2, and 1 Tokens are **placed on** the respective Artist Cards and stay there.

- **Can a player play a card if they have no cards left?**  
  No. Players with empty hands do not participate further in the round.

- **Do face-down cards count toward round-ending totals?**  
  Yes. Face-down cards are part of the cumulative count for each artist and can trigger the end of a round.

- **Are Award Tokens reusable?**  
  No. There are only 5 Award Tokens. Once placed, they stay on Artist Cards.

- **Can an artist score in multiple rounds?**  
  Yes, as long as they are in the top three in a given round.
