# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Crusader Rex is a two-player wargame simulating the struggle between the Frankish Crusaders and the Saracens in the Holy Land during the late 12th century. The game spans from 1187 to 1192, with players maneuvering military blocks across a map of key towns and castles.

**Victory Conditions:**
- **Sudden Death Victory:** A player wins immediately by controlling all seven castle locations in the hexagon towns (Antioch, Aleppo, Damascus, Tripoli, Jerusalem, Acre, Egypt) at the end of any game turn.
- **Standard Victory:** If no Sudden Death occurs, the player who controls four or more of these seven castle locations at the end of 1192 wins.

## 2. Components
- Map board showing towns, roads, ports, and victory locations
- Block units representing Frankish and Saracen forces (Outremers, Turcopoles, Military Orders, Crusaders, Emirs, Nomads, Pilgrims)
- Cards (Move and Event cards, including "Mud" and "Winter Campaign")
- Draw Pool containing unused blocks
- Turn tracker and year marker

## 3. Setup
**Frank Deployment:**
- Place starting Frank blocks (Outremers, Turcopoles, Military Orders) upright at their named home seats or designated alternate seats (e.g., Templars at Amman, Hospitallers at Baisan or Margat, Turcopoles at Acre or Tiberias).
- The Frank player may reposition these blocks before Saracens deploy.
- Remaining Frank blocks (Crusaders, Pilgrims) go into the Draw Pool face down.

**Saracen Deployment:**
- Place Emir blocks at their named seats.
- Saladin may secretly swap places with another member of his family (e.g., al-Aziz, al-Zahir).
- Draw 4 Nomad blocks (Arabs, Kurds, Turks) randomly and deploy them at their home seats.
- Remaining Saracen blocks go into the Draw Pool face down.

**Initial Control:**
- Unoccupied green towns are Saracen-controlled; unoccupied orange towns are Frank-controlled.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each year consists of six game turns. The sixth turn of each year is a Winter Turn.

**Annual Sequence:**
1. **Shuffle and Deal:** Shuffle all cards and deal 6 to each player.
2. **Five Normal Turns:**
   - Choose and simultaneously reveal 1 card each.
   - Resolve Events (Frank first if both play Events; "Winter Campaign" trumps "Mud").
   - Move blocks (Frank first unless Saracen has higher card; Franks choose on ties).
   - Resolve Battles.
   - **Siege Attrition:** Starting in the second turn of a siege, the besieged player rolls a die for each block in the castle; on 1–3, the block loses 1 step (1–2 in Tripoli/Tyre).
   - Draw and deploy 1 new block per player (except in 1187).
3. **Turn 6 (Winter Turn):**
   - Play final cards and move (–1 movement, no Forced March).
   - No new Battles or Siege Reinforcements.
   - Eliminate blocks still besieging a castle at the end of the turn, unless the "Winter Campaign" card is played.
     - **Winter Campaign Exception:** The player who plays this card ignores all Winter Turn restrictions and may maintain a siege. Both sides suffer Siege Attrition after battle (besieger rolls first).
4. **End the Year:**
   - Eliminate blocks in excess of each town’s numerical value.
     - Exception: Up to triple the town’s value if it matches the player’s color.
   - Gain replacement steps equal to each controlled town’s value.
     - Exception: No gains during a "Winter Campaign" siege.
     - Exception: Saracens not in their home seat gain 1 step per 2 town points.
   - Advance the turn marker.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Towns & Castles
- Each town has two locations: the **Castle** and the **Field**.
- The number (shield icon) indicates:
  - Maximum blocks that can be in the castle (defend or storm).
  - Blocks allowed in the town at year-end (triple if same color).
  - Steps gained per year from the town.
- **Control:** A town is controlled by the sole occupant or besieger. Unoccupied towns are controlled by their color faction.

### Movement
- **Group Move:** Spend 1 card point to move all blocks from one town to others within their move rating.
- **Muster:** Spend 1 card point to move any number of blocks to a single friendly-controlled town within their move rating.
- **Sea Move:** Spend 1 card point per block to move between friendly ports.
- **Forced March:** +1 movement; roll die: 1–3 = lose 1 step (after all movement).
- **Road Limits:**
  - Major roads: 8 blocks per turn (4 when attacking/retreating).
  - Minor roads: 4 blocks per turn (2 when attacking/retreating).
- **Pinning:** Attacking blocks pin an equal number of defending blocks (defender chooses which). Unpinned defenders cannot use the attacker’s entry road.

### Crusader Entry
- **Crusaders (German, French, English):** Must draw all three blocks of a nation before they can enter.
  - **Germans:** Enter at Antioch or Aleppo (not both); eliminated if forced to retreat off-map.
  - **French & English:** Enter at any friendly port via Sea Move; may enter at different ports.
- **Pilgrims:** Deploy to friendly ports; forfeit draw if no port available.

### Combat
**Battle Sequence:**
- Player who moved first chooses battle order.
- Declare order: choose location, reveal blocks, resolve battle, then next.

**Combat Rounds:**
- Maximum 3 rounds per turn.
- **4th Round Mandatory** if defender not eliminated:
  - Attacker must retreat.
  - Defender fires at retreating blocks.

**Reinforcements:**
- Arrive at start of Round 2.
- Include:
  - All but one attacking group arriving on different roads.
  - Defenders moving to pre-existing battle.

**Defender Identity:**
- Player who had a block in the town first.
- Former attacker if all defenders eliminated in Round 1.
- Besieged during "Storm", besieger during "Sally" or "Relief Force".

**Firing:**
- In A/B/C order: Defender A, Attacker A, Defender B, Attacker B, etc.
- Roll dice equal to block’s current strength.
- Hit on roll ≤ block’s combat number.
- Hits applied to strongest unit (owner chooses if tied).

**Retreat:**
- Block-by-block during its combat turn.
- Attacker must retreat in Round 4 if defender survives.
- Retreat limits: 4 blocks/major road, 2/minor road per round.
- Attacker retreats via roads used to enter.
- Defender may use any road not used by attacker.
- If both use same road, only second player may retreat via it.

**Regroup:**
- Victor may move victorious blocks to adjacent friendly/vacant towns.
- Road limits: 8/4 apply.
- May join unfought battles as reinforcements.

**Special Attacks:**
- **Charge (Frank blocks with shield):** Roll double dice; suffer hit for each "6".
  - Cannot Charge when Storming.
- **Harry (Saracens & Frank Turcopoles):** Fire at –1 combat number, then retreat.
  - Cannot Harry when Storming, Sallying, or Withdrawing.

### Castles & Sieges
**Withdraw to Castle:**
- Up to town’s number of defending blocks may withdraw before or during combat.
- Withdrawing blocks may not Harry.

**Battle Continuation:**
- If defenders remain in field, attacker must continue fighting, retreat, or storm.
- If field is clear, attacker may retreat, besiege, or storm.

**Besieging:**
- Besieging blocks placed face-up.
- Besieger controls town for movement.
- No combat required.

**Storming:**
- Max stormers = 2 × town rating (Tripoli & Tyre: equal to rating).
- Storming blocks may not Harry or Charge.
- **Double Defense:** Defenders require 2 hits to lose 1 step.
- Hits carry over between rounds (lost if storming ends).
- Blocks may swap in/out at start of each round.
- Storming blocks may withdraw to field (instead of firing).

**Sallying:**
- Castle blocks attack besiegers.
- Besieger becomes defender.
- Sallying blocks lose Double Defense.
- May Charge but not Harry.
- After Round 1, may retreat or withdraw to castle instead of firing.

**Relief Forces:**
- Blocks attack besiegers from adjacent towns.
- Besieger is defender.
- May be joined by sallying units.
- Relief forces may not retreat to castle.

**Ending Siege:**
- Besieger may end siege by retreating or normal movement.

### Fortified Ports (Tripoli & Tyre)
- Friendly to besieged defender.
- Defender may Sea Move into/out of castle during siege.
- Arriving blocks treated as reinforcements (arrive Round 2 if Player 2).

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Win Condition:** Control four of the seven hexagon towns by end of 1192, or all seven at any turn end.
- **Year-End Adjustments:**
  - Eliminate excess blocks beyond town limits (triple if same color).
  - Gain replacement steps equal to controlled town values.
    - Saracens not in home seat: 1 step per 2 town points.
    - No gains during "Winter Campaign" siege.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Siege Continuity:** Sieges carry over turns. Without "Winter Campaign", besieging blocks are eliminated in Winter Turn.
- **Storming/Sallying Cessation:** Cannot stop instantly; all storming/sallying blocks must withdraw or be eliminated.
- **Relief Forces & Reserves:** Player 1 relief forces arrive Round 1; Player 2 arrive Round 2. Other roads add delay.
- **Defender Deployment:** May deploy in castle before combat even if reinforcements arrive.
- **Retreat After Failed Storm:** Attacking blocks may retreat via original entry roads.
- **Assassins Card:** Can target the face-up siege marker block.
- **Winter Campaign:** Not an event card; normal priority rules apply. Can be used as Move 1 or for winter siege maintenance.
