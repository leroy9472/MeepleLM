## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Aber... bitte mit Sahne!* ("But please, with whipped cream!"), players divide cakes strategically to maximize their points. Unlike traditional fair division (one cuts, one chooses), here the server can cleverly arrange and divide cake slices to benefit themselves—even when others choose first. The goal is to score the most points by either immediately eating high-value slices or collecting slices to claim majority bonuses at the end.

### 2. Components  
- **57 Cake Slices**, categorized by variety and dollops (points):  
  - Plum: 3 slices (1 dollop each)  
  - Apricot: 4 slices (1 dollop each)  
  - Cherry: 5 slices (1 dollop each)  
  - Blackberry: 7 slices (2 dollops each)  
  - Kiwi: 8 slices (2 dollops each)  
  - Gooseberry: 9 slices (2 dollops each)  
  - Strawberry: 10 slices (2 dollops each)  
  - Chocolate: 11 slices (3 dollops each)  

Each slice shows its variety and number of whipped cream dollops (its immediate eating value).

### 3. Setup  
1. Shuffle all 57 cake slices.  
2. Form **5 face-down stacks of 11 slices** each. These represent the 5 cakes to be served.  
3. Place the **2 remaining slices face-down aside**—they are **not used** in the game.  
4. Choose a starting player—the first **server**.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds over **5 rounds**, one for each cake. In each round:

#### A. Serving the Cake  
- The **server** takes the next stack and reveals all 11 slices **in order**, placing them face-up in a line (or circle) without changing their order.  
- The server **divides the cake into at most as many pieces as there are players**.  
  - Each piece must consist of **one or more adjacent slices** in the original order.  
  - The number of pieces may be **less than the number of players**, meaning some players (including possibly the server) may receive nothing.  
  - **Exception for 2 players**: The cake may be divided into up to **4 pieces**.  

#### B. Choosing Pieces  
Starting with the player to the **left of the server**, and proceeding clockwise:  
Each player may:  
- **Choose one of the remaining pieces**, and for each slice in it, decide immediately whether to **eat** or **collect** it.  
  - **Eating**: Flip the slice face-down—score its dollop value immediately.  
  - **Collecting**: Keep the slice face-up in front of you—potential for endgame bonus.  
- **OR forfeit** selecting a piece and instead **eat collected slices of one variety** from a previous round (see below).  

The **server chooses last** (or forfeits).  
Any uneaten pieces or unclaimed slices are **removed from the game**.

#### C. Forfeiting  
A player may **skip choosing a piece** and instead:  
- Select **one variety** of cake from among those they have **collected** (face-up in front of them).  
- Flip **all collected slices of that variety** face-down.  
- Score **immediately**: each slice is worth its **dollop value** (same as eating).  
- Once eaten, those slices no longer count toward endgame majority.

> **Note**: You cannot partially eat a collected variety—you must eat **all** collected slices of that type when you forfeit.

#### D. Next Round  
The turn to serve passes **to the left**. The next player becomes the server for the next cake.  
Repeat until all 5 cakes are served.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Eating vs. Collecting  
- **Eating (immediate)**:  
  - Gain points now: 1 (Plum, Apricot, Cherry), 2 (Blackberry–Strawberry), or 3 (Chocolate).  
  - Slice is placed face-down.  
- **Collecting (delayed)**:  
  - Keep slice face-up.  
  - No points until endgame.  
  - Only the player(s) with the **most slices** of a variety score points for it.  
  - In case of a tie, **all tied players** score the full bonus.

#### Majority Bonuses (Endgame)  
At the end of the game:  
For each variety:  
- Determine who has the **most collected (face-up) slices**.  
- The player (or players, if tied) scores **points equal to the total number of slices of that variety in the game**.  

| Variety     | Total Slices | Majority Points |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Plum        | 3            | 3 points        |
| Apricot     | 4            | 4 points        |
| Cherry      | 5            | 5 points        |
| Blackberry  | 7            | 7 points        |
| Kiwi        | 8            | 8 points        |
| Gooseberry  | 9            | 9 points        |
| Strawberry  | 10           | 10 points       |
| Chocolate   | 11           | 11 points       |

> Slices that were **eaten** (face-down) do **not** count toward majority.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After the 5th cake:  
1. **Collected slices (face-up)**:  
   - For each variety, award majority points to player(s) with the most.  
   - Ties: all tied players get full points.  
2. **Eaten slices (face-down)**:  
   - Flip them face-up.  
   - Each slice scores its **dollop value**:  
     - 1 point: Plum, Apricot, Cherry  
     - 2 points: Blackberry, Kiwi, Gooseberry, Strawberry  
     - 3 points: Chocolate  
3. **Total all points**.  
4. The player with the **most points wins**.

> Optional: Play multiple rounds and sum scores.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can the server take no piece?**  
A: Yes, if they are last and no pieces remain, or if they choose to forfeit.

**Q: Can I eat just some of my collected slices of a type?**  
A: No. When you forfeit, you must eat **all collected slices of one variety**.

**Q: What if no one collected a variety?**  
A: No one scores the majority bonus for that variety.

**Q: Can I collect a slice and later eat it?**  
A: Yes, by forfeiting your turn in a future round and choosing to eat that variety.

**Q: Can two players tie for most eaten slices of a type?**  
A: Yes, but it doesn’t matter—eaten slices score individually. Only collected slices matter for majority.

**Q: Can I change the order of slices when serving?**  
A: No. The server must keep the order from the stack.

**Q: What happens to leftover slices after choosing?**  
A: They are removed from the game and not scored.
