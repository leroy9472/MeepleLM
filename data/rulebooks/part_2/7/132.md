## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Caesar and Cleopatra vie for control over Rome’s political factions (Patrician groups). Players use influence cards to sway these groups and gain patronage. The goal is to accumulate the most victory points by winning Patrician cards, achieving group majorities, collecting entire groups, and fulfilling secret bonus objectives.

### 2. Components  
- 21 Patrician cards (5 groups: Senatoren, Praetoren, Quaestoren, Zensoren, Aedilen)  
- 8 Vote of Confidence cards (including "Orgy" cards)  
- 6 Influence Bonus cards (1 secret goal per player)  
- 74 Influence cards (37 each for Rome and Egypt; values 1–5 and "P" Philosopher)  
- 26 Action cards (13 per player):  
  - Assassination (x4)  
  - Spy (x2)  
  - Roman/Egyptian Castling (x2)  
  - Scout (x2)  
  - Wrath of God (x1)  
  - Cleopatra’s/Caesar’s Veto (x2)

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player selects a side (Caesar or Cleopatra).  
2. Shuffle Influence Bonus cards; deal 1 to each player (keep secret).  
3. Lay out the 21 Patrician cards in 5 columns (groups).  
4. Shuffle Vote of Confidence cards and place face down.  
5. Each player removes 2 of each influence card (1–5), leaving 27 influence cards. Shuffle and form a deck.  
6. Each player takes one of each influence card (1–5):  
   - Place one face down beneath each of the 5 Patrician groups (1 per group).  
   - The remaining 5 form the starting hand.  
7. Arrange or shuffle Action card deck; place face down.  
8. Cleopatra plays first.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a turn, a player chooses **Active** or **Passive**:

#### Active Turn:  
1. **Play one Action card (optional)** – Resolved immediately, then discarded.  
2. **Play Influence cards (required)** – Choose one:  
   - Play **1 influence card face down** to any group, OR  
   - Play **2 influence cards face up** (may split between groups).  
   - Restrictions:  
     - Max 5 influence cards per player per group.  
     - Max 8 total influence cards per group (both players combined).  
3. **Refill hand to 5 cards** – Draw from either influence or action decks (or both). No reshuffling.  
4. **Draw a Vote of Confidence card** – Reveal and resolve (see below).

#### Passive Turn:  
- Discard any number of cards (1–5).  
- Draw replacement cards to refill hand to 5.  
- Do **not** play influence cards or action cards.  
- Do **not** draw a Vote of Confidence card.  
- If a player chooses Passive, the opponent **must** draw next turn (if able).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Vote of Confidence  
Triggered by:  
- Drawing a Vote of Confidence card naming a group, OR  
- A group reaching **8 total influence cards** (both players).  

**Resolution:**  
- Reveal all face-down cards in the group.  
- Sum influence values:  
  - **Normal:** Higher total wins one Patrician card.  
  - **With Philosopher ("P") card:** Lower total wins (outcome inverted).  
- **Tie:** No winner; cards remain face-up.  
- Winner discards their **highest-value** influence card; loser discards **lowest-value**.  
- If a group has **8 cards and is tied**, no more influence cards can be played unless changed by action cards.  
- When the **last Patrician** in a group is won, discard all remaining influence cards in that group. Remove that group’s Vote of Confidence card from the deck.

#### Philosopher ("P") Card Rules  
- Value = 0.  
- Inverts vote outcome: lowest total wins.  
- Discard rules:  
  - Winner discards lowest influence card; loser discards highest.  
  - Philosopher card is **always discarded** after resolution.  
- Special cases:  
  - Equal influence: No decision. Cards remain.  
  - Only Philosopher cards: No decision.  
  - One player has Philosopher, other has numbered cards: Philosopher wins.  
  - Both have 1 Philosopher: Cancel out; higher influence wins.  
  - One has 2 Philosophers, other has 1: Player with smaller influence wins.  
  - One has 2 Philosophers, other has 0: Treated as 1 Philosopher; both discarded.

#### Action Cards  
- **Assassination (x4):** Remove one of opponent’s **face-up** influence cards. Cannot be played if opponent has no face-up cards.  
- **Spy (x2):** Look at opponent’s hand, remove one card (discard). Opponent draws one card (influence or action).  
- **Castling – Roman/Egyptian (x2):** Pick up all your influence cards from **two groups**, redistribute face-down as desired.  
  - Max 5 per group.  
  - Total group limit (8) must not be exceeded.  
  - At least two groups must exist.  
- **Scout (x2):** Turn all opponent’s face-down cards **face-up** in one group. Requires at least one face-down card in that group.  
- **Wrath of God (x1):** Remove **all** influence cards (yours and opponent’s) from one group. Discard to respective discard piles. Requires at least one card in the group.  
- **Veto (x2):** Cancel opponent’s Action card when played.  
  - Discard both action and veto cards.  
  - Veto player draws one card (influence or action).  
  - Cannot counter a Veto with another Veto.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End  
The game ends when **any** of the following occur:  
1. All Patrician cards have been won.  
2. Both players have no influence cards and cannot play.  
3. Neither player can legally play influence cards (due to 5-per-player or 8-total limits) and has no action cards to alter the situation.

#### Scoring  
Each player scores:  
- **1 VP** per Patrician card won.  
- **1 VP** per group where they have a **majority** (e.g., 3 of 5 or 2 of 3).  
- **1 VP** if they own **all remaining Patricians** in a group (even if not all were available).  
- **2 VP** if they fulfill their **Influence Bonus card** (secret goal: e.g., “Have at least 3 influence cards in Quaestoren group”).

**Tiebreaker:**  
- Most Patrician cards.  
- If still tied, game remains a draw (unless house rules apply).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I look at my own face-down cards?** Yes, at any time.  
- **Can I play two face-down influence cards?** Not in base rules. Only one face-down or two face-up. (See variants.)  
- **What happens when a group reaches 8 cards?** A special Vote of Confidence is triggered **before** drawing replacement cards.  
- **Can I play an Action card after playing influence cards?** Yes, order is flexible as long as all actions occur before drawing.  
- **What if I draw an "Orgy" card?** No vote occurs. Turn ends normally. If it's the "Reshuffle" Orgy card, reshuffle the deck.  
- **Can I use Veto after my opponent’s turn?** No. Must be played **immediately** when opponent plays the action.  
- **Can I play Wrath of God on an empty group?** No. Must have at least one card in the group.  
- **Do discarded influence cards go back into the deck?** No. They are removed from the game.
