## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Roll dice and move pawns along a winding track to collect positive-value tiles and avoid negative ones. Lucky tiles (Clovers/Camels) can convert negative tiles into positive ones. The goal is to amass the highest point total by game’s end. The player with the most points wins; ties are broken by fewest lucky tiles, then shared victory if still tied.

### 3. Setup  

#### Base Game Setup  
1. Place Start Tile in center.  
2. Shuffle all path tiles (positive, negative, lucky) face down.

4. After every 8 tiles, place an Action Tile (Gift side up).  
5. Place Finish Tile at end.  
6. Each player takes 3 pawns (2 if 5–6 players), places them on Start.

2. Place Guards on:  
   - All 6 Lucky Tiles

3. Players place pawns on Start.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

Players take turns clockwise. On your turn:

#### Base Game  
1. Roll the die.  
2. Move **one** of your pawns forward exactly the rolled number of tiles toward Finish.  
3. If you moved off a tile where your pawn was **alone**, collect it (see *Collecting Tiles*).  
4. Close gaps by pushing tiles together.  

#### Pro Version  
Same as Base Game, except:
- You may move a **Guard** instead of your pawn, **if** the Guard shares a tile with any pawn.  
- Guards cannot be collected.  

#### Flixxy / Mummy Module  
- Roll both regular die and Action Die.  
- Action Die determines movement options:
  - **Flixxy/Mummy symbol**: Must move Flixxy/Mummy  
  - **?**: Choose to move Flixxy/Mummy, your pawn, or a Guard  
  - **X / Pawn+Guard symbol**: Cannot move Flixxy/Mummy; move your pawn or a Guard  
- Flixxy/Mummy follows same movement rules as pawns.  
- If Flixxy/Mummy is moved from a tile with no pawn or guard, **the player moving it collects the tile**.  
- If Flixxy/Mummy is on a tile with a pawn or guard, tile remains.  
- Flixxy/Mummy continues racing after reaching Finish — starts again from Start.  
- On fifth lap, after no more discs remain, remove Flixxy/Mummy and Action Die.  

#### Movement Cards Module  
1. Play one card from hand.  
2. Move one pawn or eligible Guard (if on same tile as any pawn) by card value:
   - 1–6: Move forward  
   - 0: No move  
   - −1: Move backward (cannot go before Start unless Cursed Hat)  
3. **Yellow cards**: Optional double turn — play second card after first action  
4. Discard played card(s)  
5. Draw:
   - 1 card if single turn  
   - 2 cards if double turn  
6. If you land **exactly** on Finish, take top Finish Disc

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Collecting Tiles  
- Collect a tile **only if**:
  - You moved a piece off it  
  - That piece was **the only one** on the tile at turn start  
- Remove tile and place face-up in front of you → forms **tile tower** (top = most recent)  
- **Never collect Start Tile** — return to box  
- **Action Tiles**: Do not collect; instead, trigger action (Gift/Steal)  

#### Action Tiles  
- Start with **Gift** side up  
- Triggered when you move **alone** off the tile  

##### Gift Action  
- Give **top tile** of your tower to another player:
  - If **negative**, give to player with **highest-valued top tile**  
  - If **positive/lucky**, give to player with **lowest-valued top tile**  
- In case of tie, give to **closest clockwise**  
- If you have **no tiles**, do nothing (still flip tile)  
- After action: Flip tile to **Steal** side  

##### Steal Action  
- Take **top tile** from any other player’s tower and place on yours  
- If all others have no tiles, do nothing (still flip tile)  
- After action: Flip tile to **Gift** side  

#### The Finish Tile  
- Landing on Finish ends movement (even with leftover moves)  
- Pawns on Finish cannot move  
- Once **all** your pawns are on Finish, you skip turns but can still gain/lose tiles via actions  

#### Worm / Torch Bonus Tokens  
- Acquired **only** when you collect a **negative path tile** (not via Gift/Steal)  
- Take one token from top of stack; keep face-down  
- **Cannot** use in same turn acquired  
- Play during your turn by revealing:
  - **Extra Turn**: Take another full turn  
  - **Move Top to Bottom**: Reorder your tile tower  
  - **Everyone Off!**: After rolling, choose a tile with your pawn; move **all others** (pawns, guards, Flixxy) on it by die roll  
  - **Swap Places**: Swap one of your pawns with adjacent piece (any type) — before or after move  
- Played tokens go to bottom of stack  
- Unused tokens = +1 point each at end  

#### The Hats  
- Hats placed on pawns at setup  
- **Lucky Hat**: +10 points at end  
- **Cursed Hat**: −10 points at end  
- **Lucky Hat Rule**: The pawn wearing it must be **last** of your pawns to reach Finish  
- **Cursed Hat Rule**: Can move **backward** with −1 or Movement Card; cannot go before Start unless movement exactly matches  
- Hat transfer only when moving to a tile:
  - **Take**: Move unhatted pawn to tile with hatted pawn → take a hat  
  - **Give**: Move hatted pawn to tile with unhatted pawn(s) → give hat  
  - **Exchange**: Move hatted pawn to tile with another hatted pawn → swap hats  
- Cannot transfer if you didn’t move (e.g., played 0)  

#### Added Risk Tiles  
- Collected like normal tiles  
- At end:
  - **Odd number** of Risk Tiles → all score **negative** value  
  - **Even number** → all score **positive** value  
- Lucky Tiles **do not affect** Risk Tiles  

#### Attack! Card Variant (Movement Cards)  
- Conditions:
  - Two cards of **same number** (e.g., two 4s; −1 and 1 not valid)  
  - At least one enemy pawn or guard shares tile with your pawn  
- Play both cards: Move **all enemy pawns and guards** from that tile by value of one card  
- Draw 2 cards after  
- No double turn  
- Cards can be any color

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Base Game End Condition  
Game ends when **all pawns** (all players) are on Finish Tile.  

#### Scoring  
- Sum all tile values:
  - Positive tiles: +value  
  - Negative tiles: −value (unless converted)  
- Each Lucky Tile converts **one** negative tile to positive  
- Extra Lucky Tiles beyond negatives have **no effect**  
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Most points wins  
  2. If tied, **fewer Lucky Tiles** wins  
  3. If still tied, **shared victory**

#### Module Scoring Additions  
- **Flixxy/Mummy Finish Discs**: Add value to score  
- **Worm/Torch Tokens**: Unused tokens = +1 each  
- **The Hats**: Lucky Hat = +10, Cursed Hat = −10  
- **Added Risk Tiles**: Score all as positive (even #) or negative (odd #)  
- **Movement Cards Finish Discs**: Add value to score

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

- **Can I move a Guard alone?**  
  Only if at least one pawn (any player) shares its tile.  

- **Can I move backward?**  
  Only with Cursed Hat, −1 card, or Worm/Torch token. Cannot go before Start unless movement matches exactly.  

- **What if I roll and can’t move?**  
  You must move if possible. With Pro rules, you can always move a Guard if on a tile with a pawn.  

- **Can I collect a tile with a Guard on it?**  
  No. Only tiles vacated by **your pawn alone** can be collected. If Guard is present, tile stays.  

- **Can I use multiple Worm/Torch tokens in one turn?**  
  Yes.  

- **Does Flixxy/Mummy collect tiles?**  
  Only when moved by a player **and** was alone on the tile.  

- **What happens if draw pile is empty?**  
  Reshuffle discard pile into new draw pile.  

- **Can I use a Worm/Torch token before moving?**  
  Yes, unless specified (e.g., Everyone Off! requires die roll).  

- **Can I swap hats with Flixxy/Mummy?**  
  Yes, if on adjacent tile and rules allow.
