## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
When Zeus and Hera’s feud escalates, both gods summon mythological allies to battle for control of Olympus. Each player takes the role of either Hera or Zeus. Hera seeks to rescue Argus, Zeus’s hostage, while Zeus seeks to rescue Io, Hera’s hostage. The game ends when a player successfully reveals or captures the opponent’s hostage under specific conditions.

**Win Conditions (Player wins if):**  
- They challenge the opponent’s hostage (Io or Argus) in the opponent’s first row.  
- They use Pegasus to challenge a card in the opponent’s hand and reveal the hostage.  
- They use Pegasus to challenge a card in the opponent’s hand, select Pandora, and the opponent also holds the hostage in hand.  
- They challenge Pandora in the opponent’s front row and the opponent has their hostage in that column.  
  - If both players have their hostage in the same column when Pandora is challenged, the challenger loses.

**Lose Conditions (Player loses if):**  
- They cannot use all their action points on their turn.  
- They begin their turn with no cards on their side of the playing field.

### 2. Components  
- 86 total cards (43 per player: Hera in violet, Zeus in green)  
- 1 Hera figure  
- 1 Zeus figure  
- 2 summary cards (one per player, detailing card powers and counts)  

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player:  
   - Takes their 43-card deck, corresponding god figure (Hera or Zeus), and matching summary card.  
   - Shuffles their deck and draws 9 cards for their starting hand.  
2. **Hostage Rule:** If a player draws their **own** hostage card (Io for Hera, Argus for Zeus) in the initial 9, they:  
   - Reveal it to the opponent.  
   - Draw a replacement card.  
   - Shuffle the hostage back into their deck.  
3. Each player selects 3 cards from hand and places them face down on the table to form their **first row** (3 columns).  
4. Place remaining deck face down next to god figure.  
5. Determine first player (e.g., loser of last game, or mutual agreement).  

**Note:** Unnumbered cards (mythology-only) may never be played to the field.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns. On each turn:

#### Action Points  
- Equal to the number of **occupied columns** (1–3) at the start of the turn.  
- OR, if the player has their **Hera or Zeus figure** in play, they get **4 action points** instead.  
- All action points **must be used**.  

#### Actions (in any order, up to action point limit)  
1. **Draw a card** – Take top card from deck.  
   - Hand limit: 12 cards.  
   - Cannot draw if deck is empty.  
2. **Play a card** – Place a card face down on your side of the field.

   - Cannot play into a full column (4 cards max per column).  
   - Cannot play Hera/Zeus figure into an empty column or a full column.  
3. **Challenge an opponent’s first-row card** – Only allowed from second turn onward.  
   - Only cards in your **first row** may challenge.  
   - Slide your card forward, reveal both cards.  
   - Higher strength wins. Tie = both discarded.  
   - Loser discards defeated card and shifts remaining cards forward.  
   - Medusa: Loses only to Hero/Amazon.  
   - Pandora: When challenged, **all cards in that column are discarded**.  
   - Hera/Zeus figure: Can only be removed by Pegasus challenge.  
4. **Play a Mythology Card** – Discard from hand to use special power.

- From that turn onward, you get **4 action points per turn** while the figure remains.  
- The figure cannot be moved (even with Dionysus).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Types  
- **Numbered Cards (0–7):** Strength for challenges. Played face down initially.  
- **Mythology Cards:** Have special powers. Some have strength, some don’t.  
- **Mythology-Only Cards:** No strength numbers. Never played to field; used for power and discarded.  

#### Mythology Card Powers  
| Card | Power(s) |  
|------|--------|  
| **Hera / Zeus** | Discard to place figure in front row of non-empty column. Grants 4 AP per turn. Immune except to Pegasus. |  
| **Medusa** | 0 strength. Cannot initiate challenges. Defeats all except Hero/Amazon. |  
| **Amazon / Hero** | 2–7 strength. Can defeat Medusa. Cannot challenge Medusa unless initiating. |  
| **Pandora** | 0 strength. When challenged on field: **entire column discarded**. When selected from hand via Pegasus: **opponent discards entire hand**. |  
| **Pegasus** | Strength 1. Three uses:  
1. Challenge opponent’s hand: Discard Pegasus, randomly select card.  
   - Hostage (Io/Argus): **You win**.  
   - Pandora: Opponent discards **entire hand**.  
   - Mythology card (Medusa, Pythia, etc.): Discard it.  
   - Strength 1: Discard.  
   - Strength 2–7: Place in opponent’s first row (if space).  
2. Challenge opponent’s first-row card or Hera/Zeus: Discard Pegasus.  
   - 0–1 strength (except Medusa/Pandora): Discard.  
   - Hera/Zeus: Remove figure.  
   - Medusa: Only defeated by Hero/Amazon.  
   - Pandora: Discard + clear column.  
3. Play normally to field like any card. |  
| **Pythia** | Three uses:  
1. **Spy**: Force opponent to reveal hand. Discard Poseidon/Nemesis if present.  
2. **Challenge**: Defeats Poseidon/Nemesis. Loses to all else.  
3. **Reveal Column**: Choose one opponent column; all cards turned face up. No special effects triggered. |  
| **Sirens** | Discard to take **top card** from opponent’s discard pile **if strength 1–7**. Add to hand. |  
| **Hades** | Discard to take **any one card** from your discard pile into hand. |  
| **Persephone** | Discard to take **up to 3 Pegasus cards** from your discard pile into hand. |  
| **Dionysus** | Discard to **move one card** on your side to another position (within or between columns). Cannot move Hera/Zeus. |  

#### Key Restrictions  
- **No challenges on first turn.**  
- **Only first-row cards may be challenged or issue challenges** (except Pegasus hand challenge).  
- **Hera/Zeus figure blocks challenges across that column.**  
- **Io, Argus, Medusa, Pandora, Hera, Zeus cannot initiate challenges.**  
- **Cards cannot be removed voluntarily from field (except Hera/Zeus via free action).**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play Hera/Zeus and still use actions?**  
  Yes. Playing the card costs 0 AP. If played during your turn, you immediately get 4 AP total (not 4 additional).  
- **Can I move Hera/Zeus with Dionysus?**  
  No. The figure cannot be moved by any means except voluntary removal or Pegasus challenge.  
- **What happens if I can’t place a card from Pegasus effect?**  
  If opponent’s strength 2–7 card cannot be placed (no valid column), it goes to discard pile.  
- **Can I use Pegasus to challenge a face-down card in hand?**  
  Yes. Selection is random.  
- **Can I use Pythia to reveal a column and trigger Pandora’s effect?**  
  No. Pandora’s column discard only triggers when **challenged**, not revealed.  
- **What if my deck is empty and I can’t draw?**  
  You still must use all action points. If you can’t (e.g., only action available is draw), you lose.  
- **Can I play a card behind another in a different column?**  
  No. Cards are played into specific columns. You can only reposition within or between columns using Dionysus.
