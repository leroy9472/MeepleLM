### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Potatoman*, players take on the roles of cunning farmers trying to fill potato sacks with high-quality potatoes. Though trick-taking determines who wins each round, success comes not just from winning tricks, but from strategic play to collect the most valuable sack cards. The goal is to accumulate the most potato sacks over a full game.

### 2. Components
- **52 Potato Cards** in 4 colors:
  - Red: 14 cards, values 5–18 (includes Evil Potato on 16–18)
  - Blue: 13 cards, values 4–16
  - Green: 12 cards, values 3–14
  - Yellow: 13 cards, values 1–13 (includes Potato Man on 1–3)
- **15 Sack Cards**:
  - 3 per potato color (red, blue, green, yellow)
  - 3 neutral golden sack cards (worth 35 points each)

### 3. Setup
- Shuffle the 52 potato cards.
- Deal cards based on player count:
  - **3–4 players**: Each player receives 12 cards.
  - **2 players**: Each player receives 12 cards and places 8 additional cards face-down as a personal draw pile.
  - **5 players**: Each player receives 10 cards.
- Remaining potato cards are set aside unseen.
- Place all 15 sack cards face up in color-sorted rows so availability is visible.
- Prepare pencil and paper for scoring.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. The **youngest player starts** the first round by playing any potato card from their hand.
2. Players follow in **clockwise order**, each playing one card to form a trick.
3. A trick is completed when all players have played one card (adjusted for 2- and 5-player games).
4. The **winner of the trick**:
   - Does **not** take the cards into their hand.
   - Places all trick cards and any undistributed potato cards from setup onto a **discard pile**.
   - Plays the **first card of the next trick**.
5. Repeat until the round ends.

#### Special Rules by Player Count
- **2 players**:
  - A trick consists of **4 cards** (3 colors required).
  - Players alternate playing one card at a time.
  - After each play, the player draws one card from their draw pile.
- **5 players**:
  - A trick must include **all 4 colors**.
  - One color may appear **twice**, but no more.
  - **Potato Man** cannot appear on two cards in the same trick.

#### Color Rule
- In a trick, **each color may only be played once**, unless in a 5-player game where one color may repeat.
- Exception: Potato Man (yellow 1–3) can override certain outcomes.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Taking a Trick
- The player who plays the **highest number** in the trick wins.
- **Tiebreaker**: If two players tie for highest number, the one who played **later** wins.
- **Special Rule**: If a trick contains both **Evil Potato** and **Potato Man**, **Potato Man wins**, regardless of value or play order.

#### Sack Cards
- The trick winner receives:
  - A **sack card** in the **color of the card they played** to win.
  - If no sack card of that color remains, they may take a **golden sack card (35 points)**.
  - If no golden sack cards are left, the player receives **nothing**.

#### End of a Round
A round ends immediately if:
- A player **cannot play a suitable potato card** (i.e., cannot follow color rules and has no legal play).
  - The player reveals their hand.
  - The incomplete trick is discarded.
  - No sack card is awarded.
- OR, when all players have played all their potato cards.

After a round ends:
- Players **count and record** the sack cards they have collected.
- All 52 potato cards are **reshuffled and redealt**.
- Sack cards are **reset face-up** as in initial setup.
- The player to the **left of the previous starting player** begins the next round.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- The game lasts **as many rounds as there are players** (e.g., 4 rounds for 4 players).
- After all rounds:
  - Total all sack cards collected.
  - **Highest total wins**.
- **Tiebreaker**: The player with the **highest single-round sack total** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Q: What if a player can’t play a card due to color restrictions?**  
  A: The round ends immediately. No sack card is awarded. The player must show their hand.

- **Q: What happens to undistributed potato cards at the end of a round?**  
  A: They are placed on the discard pile along with the last trick.

- **Q: Can a golden sack card be taken even if the winning card wasn’t golden?**  
  A: Yes. Golden sack cards are neutral and available when color-specific sacks are gone.

- **Q: Can two Potato Man cards be played in the same trick in a 5-player game?**  
  A: No. Players may not play two cards with Potato Man in the same trick.

- **Q: What if all sack cards (including gold) are gone?**  
  A: The trick winner receives nothing.

### Possible Variant for 3 Players
- Remove all **12 green potato cards** and **3 green sack cards**.
- Now, each trick must contain the **three remaining colors**: yellow, blue, and red.
- All other rules apply normally.
