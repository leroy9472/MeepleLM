## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Mythotopia is a strategic board game of empire-building, warfare, and resource management. Players take on the roles of rival rulers expanding their influence across a contested realm. The objective is to earn Victory Points (VP) through controlling provinces, completing objectives, and claiming VP tokens — ultimately triggering and winning the endgame to secure victory.

The game ends when a player successfully takes the **End the Game** action, meeting strict conditions and ensuring they are the sole leader in VP after all wars resolve.

On your turn:
1. **Take 1–2 Actions** (plus any number of Free Actions, which can be taken at any time)
2. **Play cards** from hand as required by the action

---

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Usage Rules  
A card can be used for **only one purpose** per turn:
- One type of **resource icon** (e.g., food, gold, stone, army, ship)
- Its **text action** (if marked "Action" or "Free Action")
- Its **Province name** (if applicable)
- **Cannot** use multiple uses from one card

#### Terrain Rules  
- **Water**: Requires **Ship cards** to cross during invasion or movement
- **Hills**: Add **+1 Food or Stone cost** when invading or building
- **Mountains**: **Impassable** — cannot invade or build across

#### Actions  
Each action requires specific cards unless otherwise noted.

| Action | Requirements | Effect |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Invade** | Province Card (origin), Army icons (≥1), 1 Food (2 if Hills), Ship cards (if crossing sea) | Place Army counters equal to Army icons into adjacent target province. War begins if contested. |
| **Place Armies** | Army icons | Add Army counters from Available pool to a province you control or are invading. +1 Food if reinforcing invasion. |
| **Remove Armies** | None | Return any number of your Army counters (from one non-war province) to Available pool. |
| **Place Ships** | Ship icons | Place Ship counters (from Available pool) into a sea adjacent to your controlled province. |
| **Remove Ships** | None | Return any number of your Ship counters (from one sea) to Available pool. |
| **Buy Armies/Ships** | Gold: 1 per Army, 2 per Ship | Add Army/Ship counters from Supply to Available pool. |
| **Build** | Build card, Province card, 2 Stone (3 if Hills) | Build City (replace Town), Road (between controlled provinces), or Castle (with Town/City). Take VP token from Road VP Card if available. |
| **End War** | Must be **first action**, war must have **clear winner** | Resolve war: highest military strength wins. Return armies; ships stay. Winner gains 3 VP (invader) or holds province (defender). |
| **Draft One Improvement Card** | Pay 1 Gold | Choose one face-up Improvement Card from display or one previously removed from your deck. Place in discard pile. Once per turn. |
| **Place Cards in Reserve** | None | Place any number of cards from hand into Reserve (visible to all). Reserve limit = 2 + 1 per City/Citadel. |
| **Discard Cards** | None | Move any cards from hand or Reserve to discard pile. |
| **Remove 1–2 Cards** | None | Return 1–2 cards from hand or Reserve to their origin (deck or hand). Your deck must remain ≥7 cards. |
| **Perform Card Action** | Card with "Action" text + any required costs | Execute effect (e.g., Alchemist, Diplomat). Counts as one action. |
| **Pass** | None | End turn without taking actions. |
| **End the Game** | Must be **first action** | Trigger endgame if: 4+ VP cards are empty of tokens AND you will win after all wars resolve (defender wins ties). |

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I use a card for both its icon and action?**  
A: No. One card, one use per turn.

**Q: What happens if I run out of cards in my deck?**  
A: Shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck. If you must draw and have no cards at all, skip drawing.

**Q: Can I invade a province connected by Road Network?**  
A: Yes. Roads allow indirect adjacency for invasion and building.

**Q: Do I need a Province Card to invade from a province?**  
A: Yes. You must play a Province Card matching the province you are attacking from (or one connected via Roads).

**Q: Can I place armies in a province under war?**  
A: Yes, if it’s your invasion or you control it — but you must pay 1 Food to reinforce.

**Q: Can I remove cards from my deck permanently?**  
A: Yes, via "Remove 1–2 Cards" action. But your deck must remain at least 7 cards.

**Q: What happens to a Province Card taken from another player’s hand or deck?**  
A: If from hand: they draw a replacement immediately.  
If from deck: they shuffle their discard into deck and find it.

**Q: Can I use Reserve cards from another player’s turn?**  
A: Only their **benefits** (e.g., +strength) apply during war. No active use.
