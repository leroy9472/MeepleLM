## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
America, the late 1960s. Amidst the counterculture and social upheaval, gangs rise not just for power, but for profit. Players take on the roles of gang bosses investing in legal businesses while using thugs and underhanded tactics to dominate the city.  
**Objective**: Be the player with the most money at the end of the game. Money includes cash on hand plus $10,000 for each development marker on your holdings.

2. Components  
- 80 cards:  
  - 30 Action cards  
  - 25 Thug cards  
  - 25 Holding cards  
- Money cards:  
  - 29 × $5,000  
  - 32 × $10,000  
  - 13 × $25,000  
  - 11 × $50,000  
- 54 development markers (green $ tokens, each worth $10,000 at game end)

3. Setup  
- Shuffle all 80 cards.  
- Deal 12 cards face down to each player. Players place their starting hand to their right.  
- Remaining cards form a draw pile in the center.  
- Place all money and development markers in the center, within reach of all players.  
- Players start with no money and no development markers.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 12 rounds.  
- **Rounds 1 and 2**: Only Phase 1 is performed.  
- **Rounds 3–12**: All four phases are performed in order:  
  1. Draft one card  
  2. Play one hand card  
  3. Perform actions  
  4. Resolve "Each turn" abilities  

**Phase 1: Draft One Card**  
- Simultaneously, each player takes the card pile to their right.  
- Select one card to add to their hand.  
- Pass the remaining cards face down to the player on their left.  

**Phase 2: Play One Hand Card**  
- Each player selects one card from their hand and places it face down in front of them.  
- After all players have done so, all cards are revealed simultaneously.  

**Phase 3: Perform Actions**  
- Players resolve their played cards in ascending order by card number (lowest first).  
- For each player’s card:  

  a. **Check Preconditions**  
    - **Costs**: If the card has a "Costs" requirement, pay by discarding cards from your display or paying money. If unable or unwilling, discard the played card with no effect.  
      - If a Holding with development markers is discarded to pay a cost, those markers are returned to the supply.  
    - **Needs**: If the card has a "Needs" requirement (icons or conditions), check if they are met using icons currently in your display (including the just-played card).  
      - Display cards are not discarded to meet needs.  
      - If any need is unmet, discard the card with no effect.  
    - **No Costs or Needs**: The card is played for free.  

  b. **Place Card in Display (if applicable)**  
    - **Action cards**: Discarded after resolving (unless "Next Turn" type).  
    - **Thug and Holding cards**: Added to your display permanently unless later removed.  

  c. **Resolve Card Action**  
    - **"When X happens, do Y"** (blue/yellow): Ongoing ability. Triggers whenever condition is met.  
    - **"Next Turn"** (green): Resolves during your next turn, even if the card is discarded before then. "Next Turn" abilities played on Round 12 have no effect.  
    - **Other abilities** (white): One-time effect, resolved immediately or at specified time.  

**Phase 4: Resolve "Each Turn" Abilities**  
- After all players have completed Phase 3, each player resolves all "Each turn" abilities on cards in their display.  
- Players may resolve these in any order.  
- Each "Each turn" ability triggers once per turn.  
- If multiple players have such abilities, resolve all simultaneously, but in ascending card number order if timing conflicts arise.  

- After all phases, "End of turn" effects (if any) resolve simultaneously.  
- A new round begins.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Types**:  
  - **Action**: Discarded after use. May have one-time, "Next Turn", or ongoing effects.  
  - **Thug**: Added to display. Provides icons (guns, cars, keys) for meeting future needs. May have abilities.  
  - **Holding**: Added to display. Provides icons (beer, hearts, spanners) for needs. When played:  
    - Place 1 development marker for each icon on the card.  
    - Plus 1 additional marker for each matching icon on other cards in your display.  
    - Example: Playing a Holding with 2 hearts, when you already have 2 hearts in display → 2 (own) + 2 (existing) = 4 markers.  

- **Icons & Needs**:  
  - Needs are met using icons from cards currently in display.  
  - The played card counts toward its own needs.  
  - Cards that trigger based on icon count include their own icons unless stated otherwise (e.g., "other" cards).  

- **Special Rules & Clarifications**:  
  - **Ed "Rubberface" Teach**: Copies another Thug in all ways (including icons and abilities). Place next to copied Thug. Does not re-pay costs.  
  - **Hideout**: Re-triggers entry actions of all Thugs in display. Does not copy "Each turn" abilities.  
  - **Loan Shark**: When you play a Holding (including itself), place one fewer development marker than normal.  
  - **Louis O'Farrell**: "Next Turn, after all played cards resolve, play an extra card." Mandatory.  
  - **Pete "Repeat" Fell**: "Next turn, when you play an Action, return it to your hand." The "Next Turn" ability of returned cards still triggers.  
  - **Liquidate!**: Gain $15,000 for each development marker on the Holding you discarded to pay its cost.  
  - **"Vicious" Sid Varney**: Only benefits from "markers on the holding you paid" if you actually paid a Holding.  
  - **Six Corners / Headquarters**: Count themselves when placing markers on Holdings with no icons.  
  - **Jenny's Waterfront Dive**: Gain $10,000 only if no beer or heart Holdings are in play (by any player).  
  - **"Friendly" Gus Caspar**: Gain $15,000 when playing any other Thug (not itself).  
  - **Harvey Ratcliffe**: Only activates on the turn it is played.  
  - **Inform! / Shakedown!**: Can trigger twice if two adjacent players meet the condition. Cannot target Harvey Ratcliffe.  
  - **Master Plan / Bookie's Joint**: End-game effects trigger after Round 12, before final scoring. Not considered a turn.  
  - **Relocate!**: "Next turn, every time you play a Holding, place as many markers..." (corrected from "any time").  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends after 12 rounds.  
- Players typically have 2 cards left in hand (no play in Rounds 1–2).  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - Each development marker is worth $10,000.  
  - Add cash on hand to value of development markers.  
  - Player with highest total wins.  
  - **Tie**: Players share victory.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can development markers be used to pay costs?**  
  No. Only money and discarding display cards can pay costs.  

- **Does Loan Shark affect itself?**  
  Yes. When you play Loan Shark as a Holding, place one fewer development marker.  

- **Does Ed "Rubberface" Teach copy "Each turn" abilities?**  
  Yes. He copies the Thug exactly, including all abilities and icons.  

- **If a "Next Turn" card is discarded, does the effect still happen?**  
  Yes. The ability resolves on your next turn regardless.  

- **Can you play two cards in one turn due to Louis O'Farrell?**  
  Yes. On your next turn, after resolving all played cards, you must play one additional card.  

- **Do "Each turn" abilities trigger in Round 1 or 2?**  
  Yes, if a card with such an ability is in your display by then. But no cards are played in Rounds 1–2, so only if added via special effect.  

- **Can you meet a Need using a Thug’s icon from a card played this turn?**  
  Yes. The played card is part of your display when checking needs.  

- **What happens if you play a card that lets you play another card (e.g., Séance) and have Pete "Repeat" Fell active?**  
  The additional Action card also returns to your hand after resolving.
