## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Dungeonquest is a solo or competitive adventure game where players explore the perilous Dragonfire Castle, facing monsters, traps, and rival heroes in search of treasure. The ultimate goal is to survive, collect valuable treasure, and return to any Tower Room before the sun sets (i.e., before being eliminated or failing to escape). Each character has unique abilities that alter gameplay, combat, movement, or survival strategies.
