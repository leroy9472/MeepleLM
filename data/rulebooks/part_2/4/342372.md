### 1. Lore & Objective

**Lore**  
Skyrim: The Adventure Game is set in the harsh, mountainous province of Skyrim, part of the continent of Tamriel. Players take on the roles of adventurers from various races—Imperials, Nords, Redguards, Bretons, Altmer, Dunmer, Bosmer, Orcs, Argonians, and Khajit—each with unique cultural backgrounds and innate abilities. The world is shaped by ancient conflicts, Daedric influence, and political unrest, including tensions with the Thalmor and the ongoing civil war.

**Objective**  
Players explore strongholds, dungeons, and the wilderness to complete quests, defeat enemies, gain experience, and level up. The ultimate goal is to complete the Main Quest and Personal Quests while managing threats to strongholds, surviving combat, and overcoming challenges presented by Events, Roaming Monsters, and environmental hazards.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Combat

**Initiation**  
Combat begins when a player draws an enemy card or encounters a Roaming Monster.

**First Round**  
- **Sneak Check**: If enemy has Sneak value and player not in Heavy Armor, roll Sneak skill. Success negates Ambush and grants automatic hit on first offensive action.
- **Ambush**: If enemy has Ambush and Sneak fails, enemy hits first with its red die.
- **Lockpicking**: Against Traps, roll Lockpicking to disarm. Failure means Trap acts as enemy.

**Subsequent Rounds**  
1. Players may use Potions or switch gear (costs 1 Stamina).
2. Tap character card to act.
3. Fleeing is allowed (fails Quest if applicable).
4. Roll Enemy die for Followers/Summons and resolve.
5. Roll Enemy die (but don’t resolve yet).
6. Choose action:
   - **Offensive**: Resolve enemy action first, then attack.
   - **Defensive**: Defend first (cancel damage if successful), then enemy acts.
   - **Special** (e.g., Rest): Resolve action first, then enemy acts.
7. Defeating an enemy: Gain XP, choose reward (first killer, then clockwise). Untap all if all enemies defeated.

**End of Combat**  
- Refill Health, Stamina, Magicka.
- If last combat in dungeon: draw Basic Treasure (Advanced if any enemy was level 4+).

#### Damage & Armor

- **Armor Types**: Physical (⚔️), Magic (🌀), Ranged (🏹)
- Damage reduced by matching armor; minimum 1 damage to foes.
- Piercing (⚔️/🌀) and Poison (☠️) bypass armor.
- Multiple damage types: player chooses which armor to use; enemy picks most damaging.
- **Final Blow**: If Health reduced to Final Blow space, player is staggered. Healing prevents defeat. If Final Blow counter reaches 0, player is Critically Injured: draw Event, add Threat equal to player count.

#### Pushing

- In combat, Push by spending Health, Stamina, or Magicka.
- Limited by the number of **multi-colored cube symbols** above Health track:
  - Health 1–7: 2 Push uses
  - Health 8–9: 1 Push use (+1 symbol)
  - Health 10: 1 Push use (+1 symbol)
- Cannot Push on Sneak or Lockpicking rolls.

#### Quests

- Max: 1 Main Quest, 2 Personal Quests.
- Main Quests cannot be failed (only replaced).
- Personal Quests can be failed via combat loss, skill test failure, or Threat overload.

#### Threat & Strongholds

- **Threat Tokens (†)**:
  - 1 Token: Cannot access Market (pay 5 gold to restore).
  - 2 Tokens: Cannot enter (pay 5 to enter + 5 to restore).
  - 3 Tokens: Takes 3 turns and 20–25 gold to fully restore.
- Threat added on Events, player defeat, and some skill checks.

#### Innate Abilities

- **Nord Battle Cry**: Stops enemy attack (once per combat).
- **Dunmer Flame Cloak**: Deals damage to all combatants (except user).
- **Khajit**: Natural stealth; bonus to Sneak.
- **Argonian**: Fast recovery; amphibious movement.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Shields & Hands**: Yes, shields occupy a hand slot.
- **Main Quest Limit**: Only 1 Main Quest allowed at a time. Drawing a second forces immediate discard of first.
- **Armor Upgrades**: Upgrading adds 1 point of any armor type. Example: Heavy Armor (4) + Magic Upgrade → 4 Physical, 1 Magic armor.
- **Multiple Threat Tokens**: Cumulative. 2+ tokens block access; full restoration costs up to 25 gold.
- **Combat Order**: Leftmost enemy acts first. If defeated before acting, next leftmost takes its place.
- **Area Damage** (e.g., Chain Lightning): Hits all players. Only active player can block.
- **Killing Blow**: Enemy always resolves attack before death (see Combat Reference, p.16).
- **Event Deck Empty**: Reshuffle discard (excluding active/completed World Quests).
- **Leveling Up Timing**: At end of game turn. So, defeating a Skeever for XP won’t remove it until next turn.
- **Market Visits**: Can sell multiple times, but only **buy one item per turn**.
- **Potions in Combat**: Can be used at start of round; healing 1 HP keeps you alive indefinitely unless hit by area damage.
- **Summons**: Resolved after enemy die roll; conjured creatures act next turn.
- **Divine Blessings / Daedric Influences**: World-wide effects chosen by prayer.
