# Beyond Baker Street — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Beyond Baker Street is a cooperative deduction game set in Victorian London, where players take on the roles of detectives working together to solve a crime before Sherlock Holmes does. The goal is to deduce the correct Suspect, Motive, and Opportunity behind a crime by gathering and interpreting evidence—while managing limited information.

You win by confirming all three Leads (Suspect, Motive, Opportunity) with exactly 20 on the Investigation track. If Sherlock reaches 0 on his track, or any loss condition is triggered, the players lose.

### 3. Setup
1. **Choose a Case File Card**: Select one (recommended: Case File 1 for first game). Higher numbers indicate greater difficulty.
2. **Place Holmes Marker**: Set it on the space matching the Holmes Rating shown on the Case File (e.g., 15 for Case File 1).
3. **Prepare Lead Piles**:
   - Shuffle Suspect, Motive, and Opportunity decks separately.
   - Place 3 cards face-down under each Lead section on the board.
   - Turn the top card of each pile face-up.
4. **Place Markers**:
   - Put 3 Confirm markers on the Case File card.
   - Place Investigation marker at 0 on the Investigation track.
5. **Distribute Character Cards (Optional)**:
   - Shuffle and deal 1 to each player (or let players choose).
   - First game: skip this step.
6. **Deal Evidence Cards**:
   - Shuffle Evidence deck.
   - Deal:
     - 2 players: 5 cards each  
     - 3 players: 4 cards each  
     - 4 players: 3 cards each  
   - Players must not look at their own cards—only others’ hands are visible.
7. **Form Draw Deck**: Place remaining Evidence cards face-down in the designated area.

Return unused components to the box.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, perform **exactly one** of the following actions:

#### A. ASSIST
- Reveal to another player how many cards they have of a specific **number** (1–5) or **icon** (e.g., "You have two Clue cards").
- You must state **all** cards matching that number/icon.
- You **cannot** say a player has zero of something.
- Afterward, advance the **Holmes marker 1 space toward 0**.

#### B. INVESTIGATE
- Play an Evidence card from your hand face-up beneath any unconfirmed Lead.
- If the card’s **icon matches** the Lead:
  - Add its number to the total.
  - If total **equals** the Lead’s value → Lead is ready to confirm.
  - If total **exceeds** the Lead’s value → Dead Lead:
    - Move Lead card face-down to the Impossible.
    - Shuffle all Evidence played to that Lead back into the Evidence deck (or form new deck if empty).
    - Reveal next card from that pile.
- If the card’s **icon does not match**:
  - Add only the **number** to the total required (ignore icon).
  - Card stays beneath the Lead.

After playing, **draw a new Evidence card** from the deck.

#### C. CONFIRM
- Only allowed if total Evidence value on a Lead exactly equals its value (including mismatched cards' numbers).
- Place a Confirm marker on the Lead.
- Turn all Evidence cards on that Lead **face-down** (no longer viewable).
- Move **Holmes marker 1 space away from 0** (i.e., increase his remaining time).
- **Important**: The **third Lead cannot be confirmed** unless the Investigation track is exactly at 20. Doing so earlier causes immediate loss.

#### D. ELIMINATE
- Play an Evidence card from your hand face-up to the Impossible.
- Advance the **Investigation marker** by the number on the card (e.g., Eliminate a "4" → +4 to track).
- Draw a new card from the Evidence deck.
- **Note**: Cards in the Impossible count toward the **maximum allowed** (shown on Case File). Exceeding this causes Holmes to advance.

#### E. PURSUE
- Discard the current face-up Lead card from any pile **face-down** to the Impossible.
- Reveal the next card from that pile.
- Shuffle **all Evidence cards** associated with that Lead (played as evidence or value modifiers) back into the Evidence deck (or form new deck if needed).
- **Warning**: If you discard the **last card** in any Lead pile, the players lose immediately.

After any action, draw a card (unless deck is empty).

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### The Impossible
- Represents eliminated possibilities.
- Holds:
  - Eliminated Evidence (from ELIMINATE action)
  - Dead Leads (from INVESTIGATE overage or PURSUE)
- All cards in the Impossible count toward the **maximum limit** on the Case File.
- If the number of cards in the Impossible **exceeds** this limit:
  - **Advance Holmes 1 space** each time this happens.

#### Hidden Information
- Players see **only other players’ hands**, never their own.
- Communication is indirect via ASSIST actions.

#### Character Cards (Advanced Play)
- Introduce special abilities that override base rules.
- Each card has:
  - A number (1–6): determines turn order (lowest goes first).
  - Pipes (• to ••••): difficulty level (more pipes = easier).
- Character rules **take precedence** over standard rules.
- Examples:
  - **Gregson**: May eliminate two cards during ELIMINATE.
  - **Jones**: Cannot play Tracks cards to Leads.
  - **Toby**: May look at one card in the discard or draw deck.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Victory Conditions (All must be met):
- All three Leads are **confirmed**.
- **Investigation track is exactly at 20**.

#### Defeat Conditions (Any one triggers loss):
- **Holmes marker reaches 0**.
- **Investigation track exceeds 20**.
- **Third Lead is confirmed before Investigation reaches 20**.
- **Any Lead pile runs out** (i.e., last card discarded to Impossible).
- **Impossible contains more cards than allowed** by the Case File (each excess advances Holmes; reaching 0 loses).

When the game ends, reveal the face-down cards in each confirmed Lead pile to verify correctness.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Q: Can I use ASSIST to say “you have no X”?**  
  A: No. You must reveal a positive count (e.g., "You have two 3s"). Saying a player has zero is invalid.

- **Q: What happens when the Evidence deck runs out?**  
  A: Players continue without drawing. The game assumes all necessary info is now available.

- **Q: Can I play a card that mismatches icon during INVESTIGATE?**  
  A: Yes. Only the number counts toward the total; the icon is ignored.

- **Q: Does ELIMINATING a card add to both Investigation track and Impossible count?**  
  A: Yes. The number increases the Investigation track, and the card itself counts toward the Impossible limit.

- **Q: Can I PURSUE a Lead that has confirmed Evidence on it?**  
  A: Yes. Doing so shuffles all cards back into the deck, even if they were helping reach the value.

- **Q: What if multiple rules conflict (e.g., Character vs. Base)?**  
  A: Character card rules **always override** base game rules.

- **Q: Do mismatched Evidence cards stay visible after Confirm?**  
  A: No. All Evidence cards under a confirmed Lead are turned face-down and cannot be referenced again.
