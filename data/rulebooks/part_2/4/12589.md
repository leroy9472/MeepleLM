## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
You are the boss of a rat mafia family competing for dominance through strategic auctions. The goal is to score the most points by acquiring and managing a collection of Auction cards (gangsters, stolen goods, businesses) over three rounds. Points are scored during each round for certain cards, and additional points are awarded at the end of the game for Business cards and Bidding cards. The player with the highest total score wins. In case of a tie, the player with the highest-value Bidding card wins.

2. Components  
- Auction Cards (141 total):  
  - Police × 21  
  - Thieves × 10  
  - Gangster × 20 (two types, 10 each)  
  - Trinket × 25 (five types, 5 each)  
  - Business × 35 (seven types, 5 each)  
  - Courthouse × 5  
  - Getaway Car × 15  
  - Driver × 10  
- Bidding Cards × 16 (values 1–16)  
- Scoring Markers × 5 (one per player)  
- Cheese Grater Marker  
- Scoring Track (double-sided)  
- Reference Cards × 5 (one per player)

3. Setup  
1. Place the Scoring Track and Cheese Grater marker within reach. Reserve space for the Auction Row (up to 7 cards) and Police Row (up to 7 cards).  
2. Give each player a Scoring Marker.  
3. Shuffle the Auction deck and place it face-down.  
4. Place the Bidding card with value "1" beside the cheese icon on the Scoring Track.  
5. Distribute Bidding cards based on player count:  
   - 2 players: 4 cards each (discard 8)  
   - 3 players: 5 cards each (discard 1)  
   - 4 players: 4 cards each (no discard)  
   - 5 players: 3 cards each (no discard)  
   (Note: Exact distribution not specified in source; inferred from standard practice and Bidding card count.)  
6. All Bidding cards are placed face-up in front of players.  
7. No discard pile is used; discarded cards go directly into the box.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- The game lasts three rounds.  
- Each round proceeds in player turns, clockwise.  
- The player with the highest-value Bidding card starts each round.  
- On your turn, choose one of three actions:  
  1. **Reveal**: Draw the top card from the Auction deck.  
     - If it’s a Police card: place it in the Police Row.  
       - If it’s the 7th Police card, the round ends immediately.  
       - Otherwise, start a forced auction.  
     - If it’s any other card: place it in the Auction Row (max 7 cards).  
     - Cannot reveal if Auction Row is full.  
  2. **Declare**: Start a voluntary auction on the current Auction Row.  
  3. **Steal**: Discard one or more Thieves cards from your collection to take an equal number of cards from the Auction Row.  
- After your action, your turn ends. Play passes clockwise.  
- If all your Bidding cards are face-down, you skip turns until the next round.  
- If only one player has face-up Bidding cards, they continue taking turns until their cards are used or the 7th Police card is revealed.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Auctions**:  
  - Triggered by:  
    - A player choosing "Declare"  
    - Revealing a Police card (except the 7th)  
  - The player who starts the auction becomes the "Cheese Greatest" and takes the Cheese Grater marker.  
  - Bidding order: starts with player to the left of Cheese Greatest, proceeds clockwise.  
  - Each player may:  
    - Bid one face-up Bidding card (value must exceed previous bid)  
    - Pass  
  - Bidding rules:  
    - First bid can be any value.  
    - Subsequent bids must be higher.  
    - In a **voluntary auction** (from Declare): if no one else bids, the Cheese Greatest must bid.  
    - In a **forced auction** (from Police or full Auction Row): all players may pass, including Cheese Greatest.  
  - If no bids are made: discard all Auction Row cards.  
- **Winning an Auction**:  
  - Winner takes all Auction Row cards into their collection.  
  - Swap the Bidding card used to win with the one beside the Scoring Track.  
  - Place the used Bidding card face-down (it will be used next round).  
- **After Auction**:  
  - Non-winning bidders reclaim their Bidding cards (remain face-up).  
  - Play resumes with the player to the left of the Cheese Greatest.  
- **Courthouse Effect**:  
  - After winning an auction, check for Courthouse cards in your collection.  
  - For each Courthouse card: discard one Business card of your choice, then discard the Courthouse.  
  - If you have no Business cards, discard the Courthouse with no penalty.  
- **Thieves**:  
  - Can be used any time via "Steal" action.  
  - Discard Thieves cards to take an equal number of cards from Auction Row.  
  - Thieves do not persist between rounds unless they have a palm tree symbol.

6. Scoring & End Game

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use Thieves after turning all Bidding cards face-down?**  
  No. Once all Bidding cards are face-down, you cannot take any actions, including Steal.  
- **What happens if the Auction Row is full and I reveal a non-Police card?**  
  You cannot choose the Reveal action if the Auction Row is full.  
- **Can I win an auction without bidding?**  
  No. Only the highest bidder wins. If no one bids, all Auction Row cards are discarded.  
- **Do Gangster pair points stack?**  
  No. You score +5 for having at least one pair (one of each type). Extra pairs do not give extra points.  
- **Can I use multiple Thieves in one turn?**  
  Yes. Discard any number of Thieves to take an equal number of cards from the Auction Row.  
- **What if I win an auction but have no Business cards when I have a Courthouse?**  
  Discard the Courthouse with no penalty.  
- **Is the 1-value Bidding card beside the track used in bidding?**  
  Yes. It is swapped with the card used to win an auction and becomes available in future rounds.
