## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Inkognito*, players are secret agents operating in Venice, each assuming the identity of one of four eccentric characters: Lord Fiddlebottom, Colonel Bubble, Agent X, or Madame Zsa Zsa. Each agent has a hidden identity, build (physical description), and mission. Agents operate in pairs—each player has one secret partner. The goal is to identify your partner, uncover your joint mission, and complete it.

In the 5-player variant, the fifth player takes on the role of the Ambassador, a neutral investigator trying to unmask all agents before any team completes their mission.

### 2. Components  
- Game board depicting Venice with land (orange lines) and water (light blue dashed lines) routes  
- Phantom of Prophecy (a shaker with colored balls that determines movement options)  
- 16 agent figures (4 per player, in 4 colors)  
- 32 colored cards:  
  - 16 identity cards (4 per character)  
  - 16 build cards (4 per build)  
- 16 grey secret cards:  
  - 4 identity cards  
  - 4 build cards  
  - 8 mission cards (4 pairs)  
- 4 passports (one per color)  
- 4 note sheets  
- 1 Ambassador figure  
- 1 Embassy space marker  

### 3. Setup  
#### For 4 Players:  
- Place the Phantom of Prophecy in the upper left corner of the board.  
- Place the Ambassador figure on the Embassy space (black circle).  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 4 agent figures  
  - 8 colored cards (4 identity, 4 build)  
  - 1 passport  
  - 1 note sheet  
- Place each player’s 4 figures on the 4 matching colored starting spaces.  
- Each player draws 3 grey secret cards:  
  - 1 identity card (reveals their true agent identity)  
  - 1 build card (reveals their true physical description)  
  - 1 mission card (half of a paired mission objective)  
- Players write the names/colors of the other three players on the first three rows of their note sheet. The fourth row is for tracking information they have revealed to others.  
- The passport is used as a screen to conceal the note sheet.

#### For 3 Players:  
- Remove one color’s components (figures, cards, passport).  
- Set aside one full set of grey secret cards.  
- Play proceeds normally. If a player discovers their partner is missing, their mission becomes escaping Venice via a specific location based on their character.

#### For 5 Players:  
- The fifth player controls only the Ambassador.  
- They do not have agent figures, colored cards, or a Phantom.  
- The Ambassador player receives a note sheet to record intelligence.  
- All other players receive standard components.  
- The Ambassador starts on the Embassy space.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On a turn, perform the following steps:

#### 1. Movement  
- Shake the Phantom of Prophecy. The three colored balls determine your available movement actions. You may choose any three from the following list (repeats allowed if multiple balls match):  
  - Move one of your figures 1 space via land route (orange).  
  - Move one of your figures 1 space via water route (light blue dashed).  
  - Move one of your figures 1 space on land or water.  
  - Move one opponent’s figure 1 space on land or water.  
  - Move the Ambassador 1 space on land or water.  
- You are not required to use all three actions.  
- Movement rules:  
  - You may move through or onto spaces occupied by other players’ figures.  
  - You **cannot end** your move on a space occupied by one of your own other figures.  
  - You **cannot end** with more than one of your figures on the same space as more than one figure of a single opponent (i.e., you can meet multiple players, but not two figures from the same player).  
  - The Ambassador may be moved to a space occupied by one of your figures, but **not** to a space occupied by another player’s figure.  
  - An opponent’s figure may be moved onto a space occupied by one of your figures (to initiate a meeting), but **not** onto a space occupied by another opponent’s figure or the Ambassador.

#### 2. Meeting Characters and Asking Questions  
A meeting occurs when:  
- You move one of your figures onto a space with another player’s figure, or  
- You move another player’s figure onto a space with one of your figures, or  
- You move your figure onto the Ambassador.

##### Meeting Options:  
After a meeting, you may:  
- Ask questions (see below), **or**  
- Instead, move one of your own figures **1 additional space** on land or water (cannot end on occupied space).

##### Asking Questions:  
**Meeting a Player’s Figure:**  
You may ask one of the following:  
1. **About Identity**: The player must secretly show you:  
   - 2 identity cards  
   - 1 build card  
   At least **one** of the three cards must be true.  
2. **About Build Type**: The player must secretly show you:  
   - 2 build cards  
   - 1 identity card  
   At least **one** of the three cards must be true.  

**Meeting the Ambassador:**  
You may request to see either:  
- 2 identity cards, **or**  
- 2 build cards  
...from **any one player** of your choice. At least **one** of the two cards must be true.

> In the **5-player variant**, when an agent uses the Ambassador to question another agent, the questioned player first shows the cards to the **Ambassador player**, who views them, then passes them to the asking player. This allows the Ambassador to gather intelligence every time their figure is used.

##### Recording Information  
- Write down received information on your note sheet.  
- Use a different symbol to record which of **your own cards** you have shown to others (fourth row of note sheet).

##### Restrictions on Repeating Information  
- You **cannot show the same set of 3 cards** (same identity and build cards in same combination) to the same player more than once.  
- If you do so **accidentally** and the player calls it out:  
  - **Second time**: Show only 2 cards, at least one true.  
  - **Third time**: Show only 1 card, and it **must be true**.  
- If a dispute arises, you must **prove** via your notes that you did not repeat the set. If you cannot, you must accept the penalty.  
- When showing cards to a player who is questioning **via the Ambassador**, you cannot show:  
  - A pair of cards you’ve shown that player before, **or**  
  - A pair that was part of a previous 3-card set you showed them.  
  - If you do, you must show only **1 true card**.

##### Expulsion  
After questioning:  
- If you questioned a **player’s figure**, send that figure to any **unnumbered, unoccupied space**.  
- If you questioned the **Ambassador**, send him to:  
  - The Embassy space (if unoccupied), **or**  
  - Any unoccupied colored starting space.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Hidden Roles**: Each player has a secret identity, build, and mission.  
- **Bluffing & Deduction**: Players use misleading card reveals to confuse opponents while gathering real information.  
- **Movement Determination**: The Phantom of Prophecy introduces variability in movement options each turn.  
- **Meeting Mechanic**: Central to information gathering; enables card reveals and additional movement.  
- **Information Tracking**: Note sheets are essential for tracking both received and given information.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Winning Conditions  
**Standard (4 Players):**  
- Teams win by **completing their shared mission**.  
- To do so:  
  1. Identify your **partner**.  
  2. Reveal your **true identity** (via character trait or showing secret cards).  
  3. Share **mission cards** to decode the full mission using your passports.  
  4. Fulfill the mission condition **during your turn**.  
- Announce victory by saying **“Mission Accomplished!”** and performing a grandiose handshake with your partner.  
- If the team is incorrect about:  
  - Their **partnership**, or  
  - The **mission objective**,  
  then the **opposing team wins**.

**3-Player Variant:**  
- If your partner is the missing agent, your mission is to **escape Venice** by moving your agent to a specific location:  
  - Lord Fiddlebottom → Location #5  
  - Colonel Bubble → Location #1  
  - Madame Zsa Zsa → Location #4  
  - Agent X → Location #6  
- If your mission refers to the missing character, interpret it as referring to **yourself**.

**5-Player Variant (Ambassador):**  
- The Ambassador wins by:  
  - Declaring **“I know who you are…”**  
  - Recording all **identities and build types** of the 4 agents on their note sheet.  
  - When a spy team declares “Mission Accomplished!”, the Ambassador reveals their sheet.  
  - If **all identities and builds are correct**, the Ambassador wins.  
  - If any are wrong, the spy team wins (if their claim is valid); otherwise, the other spy team wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move the Ambassador onto a space with another player’s figure?**  
  No. The Ambassador cannot be moved to a space occupied by another player’s figure.  
- **Can I move an opponent’s figure onto another opponent’s figure?**  
  No. You cannot move any figure onto a space occupied by another player’s figure (except your own).  
- **Do I have to use all three movement actions?**  
  No. You may use 1, 2, or 3 actions.  
- **Can I meet multiple figures in one turn?**  
  Yes, but you can only **question one figure per turn** (the one you meet during your final movement).  
- **Can I reveal my mission card during a question?**  
  Yes, but it **does not count** toward the “at least one true card” rule—you must still show at least one true colored card.  
- **Can I lie completely when showing cards?**  
  No. At least **one** card shown must be true.  
- **Can I bluff my partner using the trait?**  
  Yes, but be careful—only one player has each true identity.  
- **What happens if the Embassy is occupied and I need to return the Ambassador?**  
  Return the Ambassador to **any unoccupied colored starting space**.
