## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
FITS is an abstract tile-placement puzzle game designed by Reiner Knizia. Players aim to strategically place polyomino-shaped tiles on a grid-based board to maximize their score while minimizing penalty points. The core challenge lies in efficiently covering valuable spaces and creating scoring opportunities based on each round’s unique board rules.

The objective is to achieve the highest total score across four rounds by skillfully managing tile placement, special board features, and spatial constraints.

2. Components  
- 8 double-sided game boards (2 per player, numbered 1–4)  
- 4 ramps (with triangular anti-skid pads attached)  
- 4 transparent covers  
- 64 game tiles (16 each in red, green, blue, yellow)  
- 4 starting cards  
- 16 building cards  

Optional expansions referenced include:
- BOOM Expansion: introduces explosive ("boom") dots that cause tile loss
- Word Board: uses lettered grids for word formation
- Volatile Scoring: scores after each move
- Wormholes: enables inter-player tile transfer
- Sideways, Cursed, Walking on Eggshells, Avoiding Montezuma, and others: alternative scoring variants

3. Setup  
- Each player selects a color and takes:
  - All 16 tiles of that color
  - Both game boards of their color
  - One ramp and one transparent cover
- Unused player kits are returned to the box if fewer than 4 play.
- Shuffle the 4 starting cards and 16 building cards separately into face-down decks.
- Prepare paper and pencil for scoring.

For each round:
- Insert the corresponding numbered board (1 in Round 1, 2 in Round 2, etc.) into the ramp with the number visible at the top.
- Place the transparent cover over the ramp.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of four rounds. Each round follows this sequence:

1. **Starting Tile Placement**  
   - Each player draws one starting card from the deck.  
   - They select the tile shown and place it on their board by sliding it down the ramp from the top.  
   - The tile may be rotated in any of up to 8 orientations.  
   - It must be placed so its indentations align with the cover’s tracks and then slid straight down until it hits the bottom or existing tiles.  
   - No lateral adjustment is allowed during or after sliding.

2. **Building Phase**  
   - One player reveals the top building card from the deck.  
   - All players simultaneously retrieve the corresponding tile from their supply.  
   - Each places and slides it down their ramp using the same rules as the starting tile.  
   - If a player's starting tile matches the current building card, they skip that turn (no placement).  
   - Players may choose to set aside a tile instead of placing it; once set aside, it cannot be used again that round.  
   - Tiles must come to rest within the grid boundaries (may extend past top edge, but not left/right).  
   - No tile may be placed into an enclosed space inaccessible from above.  
   - After all players act, the next building card is revealed.  
   - This continues until all 16 building cards are used.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Tile Movement**: All tiles must be placed via the ramp and cover system. Once released, they slide straight down until stopped.
- **Spatial Constraints**: Gaps cannot be filled if not accessible from above (i.e., surrounded on three or more sides).
- **Shared Card Draw**: All players use the same tile type each turn based on the revealed building card.
- **Tile Omission**: Players may opt not to place a tile by setting it aside. This is irreversible for the round.
- **Rotation & Orientation**: Players may rotate tiles freely before placement, but final position is determined by physics of the ramp.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Scoring occurs at the end of each round, based on the active board:

**General Rule (All Boards):**  
Each uncovered dot (grid intersection) counts as -1 point.

**Board-Specific Rules:**  
- **Board 1**: +1 point per complete horizontal row (all dots covered).  
- **Board 2**: Bonus spaces with values +1, +2, +3 — score face value if uncovered.  
- **Board 3**: Mixed bonus/penalty spaces (e.g., +3, -5); score or lose points accordingly if uncovered.  
- **Board 4**: Five symbol pairs (e.g., ⬤, ⬛, ⬛, etc.).  
  - +3 for each fully uncovered pair.  
  - -3 for each pair with only one symbol visible.  
  - 0 if both are covered.

After Round 4, total all scores. Highest score wins. Ties result in shared victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I adjust a tile after it stops sliding?**  
  No. Final position is binding once the tile comes to rest.

- **What happens if a tile doesn’t fit anywhere?**  
  You may set it aside. You are not required to place every tile.

- **Can tiles hang off the top edge?**  
  Yes. Overhang at the top is allowed. Left/right overhang is not.

- **Can I place a tile that only partially covers the board?**  
  Only if part of it lies within the grid and it was slid correctly. If it cannot lie flat or fully enter the playable area, it must be set aside.

- **Do I keep my starting card until the end of the round?**  
  Yes. It remains in front of you as a reference.

- **Are expansions official?**  
  The core rules are from Ravensburger. BOOM, Word, Wormholes, and others appear to be fan-made variants.
