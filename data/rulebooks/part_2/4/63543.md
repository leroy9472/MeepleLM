## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Horus Heresy is a two-player asymmetric wargame set during the epic civil war in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. One player commands the Loyalist Space Marines defending Terra, while the other leads the Traitor Legions of Horus in an attempt to overthrow the Emperor. The game combines strategic planning, card-driven actions, and tactical combat.

**Victory Conditions:**
- **Death of the Emperor or Horus:** Eliminate the enemy commander.
- **Spaceport Victory:** Control all four spaceport areas on Terra once an initiative marker reaches or passes the "Spaceport Victory Possible" space.
- **Imperial Hold-out Victory:** The Imperial player wins instantly if any initiative marker lands on the "Imperial Victory" space.

All victory conditions are immediate and end the game.

### 2. Components
- Main map board (Terra and Vengeful Spirit)
- Unit figures (Imperial and Traitor)
- Hero figures (e.g., Horus, Emperor, Rogal Dorn, Magnus)
- Bases (grey for Imperial, black for Traitor)
- Initiative track with markers
- Order cards (per player, with green skull starting cards)
- Combat decks and Hero combat decks (per player)
- Event deck (Act I, II, III)
- Bombardment deck
- Strategic map (abstract representation of Terra)
- Activation and routed activation markers
- Fortification and breach tokens
- Hero damage track and markers
- Defense lasers (Imperial only)
- Damage tokens

### 3. Setup
#### 1) Select Scenario
- Recommended for beginners: "Brother Against Brother"
- Experienced player should control Traitor forces if skill levels differ.
- Use Bombardment Card Draw (Eagle = Loyalist wins initiative; Chaos Star = Traitor) or consensus to determine sides.

#### 2) Event Deck Construction
- Assemble event cards per scenario instructions for Act I, II, and III.
- Shuffle each act's cards face down.
- Stack Act I on top, followed by Act II and III.
- Return unused cards to the box.

#### 3) Corruption
- Traitor may corrupt Imperial units as specified by the scenario.
- Steps:
  1. Traitor chooses an Imperial unit on the board.
  2. Draws top card from Bombardment deck:
     - Eagle: no effect
     - Chaos Star: unit is corrupted (place on black Traitor base)
  3. Corrupted unit remains in same area.
  4. Each unit can be corrupted only once.
  5. Drawn cards are discarded.

#### 4) Bombardment
- Traitor conducts orbital bombardments as specified by scenario.
- Rules:
  1. Choose non-fortified area on main map (fortified areas cannot be targeted during setup).
  2. Declare bombardment type: Precise (more accurate, less damage) or Reckless (less accurate, more damage).
  3. Draw top card from Bombardment deck and apply Orbital effect.
  4. Assign damage among units in area; Traitor must damage own units if enemy units are destroyed.
  5. Fortifications reduce damage by 2 (or 1 if breached).
  6. Breach effects allow Traitor to breach one adjacent fortified border segment.
  7. Heroes are immune to bombardment.
  8. Same area may be bombarded multiple times.

#### 5) Order Cards Setup
- Each player:
  1. Removes all starting order cards (green skull icon) from deck to form starting hand.
  2. Follows scenario-specific instructions for placing order cards (on strategic map, in hand, etc.).
  3. Shuffles remaining order cards to form face-down order deck.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of four steps:

#### 1. Action Step
Current player (closest to start of initiative track) chooses one action:
- **Place an Order:** Place order card face down on strategic map stack. Cost: 1 IP.
- **Execute Order from Strategic Map:** Execute top card from any stack. Cannot execute cards placed this round. Cost: 1 IP.
- **Execute Order from Hand:** Execute card directly from hand in chosen region. Cost: 0–3 IP (based on cost icons).
- **Bury an Order:** Move top card of any stack to bottom without looking. Cost: 1 IP.
- **Draw an Order:** Draw top card from order deck or choose from reserve. Cost: 1 IP. Cannot exceed 6 cards in hand.

#### 2. Advance Initiative
- Current player advances their initiative marker by the action’s cost.

#### 3. Change of Initiative (if necessary)
- If current player's marker passes or lands under opponent's marker:
  - **Coexistence Battles:** Fight in all contested areas. Imperial player chooses order.
  - **Stacking Limits:** Check limits:
    - Normal areas: 6 units per side
    - Fortified areas: 3 units per side
    - Units exceeding limit must be removed (player's choice).
    - Heroes and defense lasers do not count.

#### 4. Special Phases (if necessary)
- If initiative marker passed or landed on a special phase icon:
  - **Event Phase:** Current player draws and resolves top event card.
  - **Draw Orders Phase:**
    1. Starting with current player, each may discard any cards from hand (recyclable cards go to reserve).
    2. Starting with current player, each may move cards from reserve to hand (max 6 total).
    3. Each player draws from order deck until hand has 6 cards.
  - **Refresh Phase:**
    1. Remove all activation markers (activation side up).
    2. Flip all routed activation markers to activation side.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Movement
- Cost: 1 MP to move between adjacent friendly/neutral areas; 2 MP if crossing crevasse.
- Most units have 2 MPs; exceptions:
  - Space Marines, Tank Divisions: 3 MPs
  - Thunderhawks: 5 MPs
- Flying units:
  - Pay 1 MP to cross crevasse
  - May move through enemy/contested areas (cannot end there)
- Flying transport (e.g., Thunderhawk):
  - May pick up units (up to combat rating) when starting movement or entering area
  - Cannot pick up from activated area
  - May drop off during movement or at end
  - Must drop off all units at end of movement
  - Heroes count as one unit for transport

#### Combat
A battle occurs via:
- Attack order execution
- Coexistence during Change of Initiative

**Battle Steps:**

1. **Joining Battle**
   - Attacker: player who executed attack order (or Imperial in coexistence)
   - Defender: opponent
   - Target area: must contain enemy unit or Hero
   - Origin area(s): adjacent to target, must contain at least one attacker unit
   - Coexistence: area is both target and origin

2. **Engaging Units**
   - Attacker chooses which units/Heroes from origin to engage
   - All units/Heroes in target area automatically engage
   - Flying units may spend up to 3 MPs to move to adjacent friendly/neutral area and join (must be legal origin)
   - Flying units cannot join coexistence battles

3. **Preparing to Fight**
   - Each player:
     - Sums combat ratings of engaged units, divides by 2 (round up), draws that many combat cards
     - Draws 2 Hero combat cards if at least one unwounded Hero engaged; 1 if all engaged Heroes wounded
   - Place iteration marker on track start

4. **Combat Iterations**
   - Defender chooses who is Active Player (AP) in first iteration; roles alternate
   - Each iteration:
     1. **AP plays cards or retreats:**
        - Play up to current iteration number of cards
        - May pass (skip to step 6)
        - May retreat (except 1st iteration; cannot if any engaged unit in area with routed marker)
     2. **AP carries out special effects:**
        - Choose up to 1 non-free special effect (must meet unit requirement)
        - Passive Player may discard shields to counter (if cost specified)
        - Then carry out any number of free effects
     3. **AP totals regular damage:** Sum attack values of all played cards
     4. **Passive Player resists:** Discard up to iteration number of cards; each shield reduces damage by 1
     5. **AP assigns damage:** Assign remaining damage to enemy units; may damage Heroes only if no units remain
     6. **Advance iteration:** Move marker; battle ends if past allowed iterations

5. **End of Battle**
   - Ends when:
     - All iterations complete
     - One side eliminated or retreated
     - Both players out of combat/hero cards
   - If no defending units in target, attacker may move surviving units/Heroes there
   - Discard unused combat/hero cards
   - Discard or recycle attack order

#### Damage and Elimination
- Unit eliminated when damage equals combat rank
- Damage is cumulative and persistent
- Eliminated units:
  - Traitor: return to box (except Traitor Army/Tank Division → stockpile)
  - Imperial: return to box (except Army, Tank Division, Titan → stockpile)

#### Routing
- **Defender routs:** Move unit to adjacent friendly/neutral area; if impossible or area has routed marker, eliminate
- **Attacker routs:** Unit stays in origin; if area has routed marker, eliminate
- Only flying units may rout across crevasses
- Destination marked with routed activation marker

#### Heroes
- Not considered units unless specified
- Move via orders; treated as units with 3 MPs for movement
- Cannot be damaged by bombardment
- Unsupported Hero (no friendly units) does not control area; triggers coexistence battle if enemy units present
- Hero damage tracked on Hero damage track:
  - Unwounded: normal
  - Wounded: draw 1 Hero combat card
  - Defeated: removed from game
- When Hero defeated in battle, draw bombardment card for each friendly unit in area; if icon mismatch, unit routs

#### Fortifications
- Fortified areas: factories, fortresses, palace, Vengeful Spirit Command Center
- Effects:
  - Defending units reduce regular damage by 2 (unbreached) or 1 (breached)
  - Does not reduce special or Thunderhawk damage
  - No benefit in coexistence battles (except Rogal Dorn)
  - Stacking limit: 3 per side
- Breach:
  - Placed on border segment; only one per segment
  - Flying attackers treat border as breached (no token placed)
  - Breach reduces damage reduction to 1
- Crevasse fortification:
  - If all attackers cross crevasse, defender gets -2 damage
  - If some attackers don’t cross, no benefit
  - No effect on stacking or bombardment

#### Bombardment
- **Orbital:**
  - Choose area on Terra
  - Declare precise/reckless
  - Draw card, apply Orbital effect
  - Assign damage; Traitor damages own units after enemy units destroyed
  - Fortifications reduce damage by 2 (1 if breached)
  - Breach effect allows one border segment breach
- **Thunderhawk:**
  - From combat card special effect
  - Draw card, apply Thunderhawk effect
  - Damage not regular; cannot be reduced by shields or fortifications
  - Can damage unengaged units

#### Defense Lasers
- Triggered when Traitor executes Port Landing or Drop Pods
- Imperial draws one bombardment card per landing unit
- Uses Defense Laser section of card based on number of lasers in/adjacent to landing area
- Hit: unit eliminated; Miss: unit lands
- Cannot target Heroes
- Imperial chooses target unit before drawing each card
- Destroyed when area becomes Traitor-friendly (must be occupied, not just passed through)

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends immediately when any victory condition is met:
  - Eliminate enemy commander (Emperor or Horus)
  - Control all four spaceport areas after initiative marker reaches Spaceport Victory space
  - Any initiative marker lands on Imperial Victory space (Imperial win)
- No scoring; game is won by achieving one of the above.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a hero attack alone?** No. An origin area must contain at least one unit. Hero can be engaged, but not initiate attack alone.
- **Can heroes move through enemy areas?** Only if supported by units and via movement order that allows it (e.g., Jaghatai Khan’s ability).
- **Do damage tokens affect combat card draw?** No. Card draw based on unit’s combat rank, not current damage.
- **Can you bombard fortified areas during gameplay?** Yes. Only setup phase forbids targeting fortifications.
- **Do flying units cause permanent breaches?** No. Border is treated as breached only while flying units are engaged.
- **Can you retreat in first iteration?** No.
- **Can you assign damage to enemy Hero if units remain?** No. Must eliminate all units first.
- **Can defense lasers be destroyed by moving through?** No. Traitor unit must occupy the area to make it friendly.
