## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Compounded*, players take on the roles of lab managers competing to complete chemical compounds before their rivals or before explosions destroy them. The game blends strategy, resource management, and risk assessment in a dynamic lab environment. The objective is to earn the most Atomic Points (AP) by completing compounds, managing experiments, and utilizing lab tools effectively.

The game ends when one of the following occurs:  
- A scientist reaches 50 AP.  
- A scientist completes 3 of the 4 Experiments on their Work Bench.  
- The Research Field cannot be filled to capacity.

If the first or second condition triggers the endgame, all players get one additional turn. If the third condition occurs, the game ends immediately.

### 3. Setup  
**For 3–5 Scientists:**  
1. Place the Score Track in the center.  
2. Each scientist takes:  
   - A Work Bench in their color  
   - 3 Claim Tokens  
   - 1 Scoring Token (placed at 0 on Score Track)  
   - 1 of each Experiment Token (Discovery, Study, Research, Lab)  
   - 1 Wild Element Token  
   - 1 Fire Extinguisher  
3. Place Lab Tools:  
   - One fewer Graduated Cylinder, Pipet, and Journal than the number of players.  
4. Create the Research Field:  
   - Deal 9 Starting Compounds face-up in a 4×4 grid (fill remaining 7 spaces from top of Compound Deck).  
5. Prepare Compound Deck:  
   - Shuffle 54 normal compounds.  
   - Divide into six stacks: five of 8 cards, one of 7.  
   - Set one 8-card stack aside.  
   - Place one Lab Fire on top of each of the other five stacks.  
   - Stack them together, then place the set-aside stack on top.  
6. Draw 4 random Elements per scientist from the bag and place in Element Storage.  
7. Place 2 Claim Tokens in Claim Reserve; 1 Claim Token on the Active Claim Token area (top of Study Experiment).  
8. Place Storage Markers on the Lab test tube.  

**Lead Scientist:**  
- Scientist with the rarest total Elements on Work Bench starts.  
- In case of tie, youngest scientist is Lead Scientist.  
- They receive the wooden Lab Key.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of four phases:

#### Phase I: Discovery  
- **Skipped in Round 1.**  
- Starting with Lead Scientist, each scientist draws a number of Elements from the bag equal to their **Discovery Experiment** level.  
- Elements go into Element Storage.  
- Trading occurs: Elements, Tools, Fire Extinguishers, Wild Elements, or future favors may be traded.  
  - No trading of AP or Experiment levels.  
  - Favors are non-binding.  
- After trading, excess Elements beyond storage capacity are returned to the bag (player’s choice which ones).

#### Phase II: Study  
- Starting with Lead Scientist, each scientist may place one Claim Token on an **unclaimed Compound**.  
- Continue clockwise until all scientists pass. Once passed, cannot act again this phase.  
- After placement, each scientist (starting with Lead Scientist) may **move one existing Claim Token** (from previous rounds) to another unclaimed Compound. Only one move per scientist.

#### Phase III: Research  
- Starting with Lead Scientist, each scientist places a number of Elements equal to their **Research Experiment** level.  
  - Elements may be placed on:  
    - Any claimed or unclaimed Compound  
    - Their personal Fire Extinguisher  
- Placement Rules:  
  - Must place on open Element space.  
  - Scientist who completes an **unclaimed Compound** places a temporary Claim Token (from Claim Reserve) on it.  
  - If no Claim Tokens in reserve, cannot claim or score.  
- Special Actions:  
  - **Wild Element Token**: May be discarded to draw any Element (except Sulfur) from bag and place immediately.  
  - **3-for-1 Trade**: Once per phase, trade 3 of the same Element from Work Bench for any 1 Element from bag.  
  - **Pipet Tool**: Instead of 3-for-1, may do 2-for-1 (only once per round; not same turn as 3-for-1).  
  - **Safety Goggles**: Discard to Discover again (draw Discovery-level Elements); must place or return unused after Research.  

#### Phase IV: Lab  
- **Scoring Completed Compounds:**  
  - Starting with Lead Scientist, score each completed Compound (all Element spaces filled).  
  - Steps:  
    1. Remove Compound card and place next to scoring scientist’s Work Bench.  
    2. Advance Scoring Token on Score Track by Atomic Number (AP value).  
    3. Return Claim Token:  
       - If temporary (Claim Reserve side up) → return to Claim Reserve  
       - Otherwise → place on Study test tube for next round  
    4. Return all Elements on Compound to bag (unless Journal used).  
  - **Lab Tools**: If Compound has tool icon, scientist gains that tool (if not already owned).  
  - **Raise Experiment**: Scientist may raise the Experiment matching the Compound’s state:  
    - Liquid → Discovery  
    - Solid → Study  
    - Gas → Research  
    - May choose to raise **Lab Experiment** instead.  
      - When raised, move Storage Marker to Work Bench → increases Element Storage by 1 (max 7).  
  - **Chemical Reactions**: Trigger immediately after scoring:  
    - **Grant**: Choose another scientist and one of their non-maxed Experiments; increase it by 1.  
      - If all Experiments maxed, AP is shared equally (remainder discarded).  
    - **Volatile**: Acts as Lab Fire revealed (see below).  
    - **Hazardous Hauling**: Each scientist moves one Element from this Compound to any other in Research Field. Owner of left-side Claim Token chooses first.  
    - **Corrosive Compound**: Both scoring scientists move down 1 level on Study Experiment (if possible).  
    - **Explosive Elements**: All Compounds with ≥1 Flame Token explode immediately.  

- **Refill Research Field:**  
  - Lead Scientist draws cards to fill empty spaces left-to-right, top-to-bottom.  
  - **If Lab Fire is drawn**:  
    - Set aside Fire card.  
    - Place 1 Flame Token on all **flammable** Compounds.  
    - Compounds reaching Flame Token limit **explode**:  
      - Remove card.  
      - Scatter Elements to adjacent (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) Compounds with space.  
        - If claimed → owner chooses placement  
        - If unclaimed → Lead Scientist chooses  
      - Unplaceable Elements are discarded.  
    - Refill gaps with new cards.  
    - **Only one Lab Fire per turn**, but **Volatile Reaction can occur in same turn**.  
  - **Fire Extinguisher Use**: May be discarded to prevent one Flame Token from being placed (any Compound, even unclaimed or opponent’s).  

- **Pass Lab Key**: To player on left.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Work Bench  
- **Element Storage**: Starts at 4 spaces; upgradable to 7 via Lab Experiment.  
- **Experiments**:  
  - **Discovery (Liquid)**: Draw Elements = level  
  - **Study (Solid)**: Max Claim Tokens = level  
  - **Research (Gas)**: Place Elements = level  
  - **Lab (Wild)**: Increase Element Storage (max 7)  

#### Lab Tools  
- **One-Time Use (Discarded after use):**  
  - **Safety Goggles (Blue)**: Draw extra Elements in Research; unused returned to bag.  
  - **Lab Key (Blue)**: Discard to become Lead Scientist next round.  
  - **Bunsen Burner (Gray)**: Add 1 Flame Token to any Compound (even non-flammable → becomes flammable, limit 2). Can cause explosion. Fire Extinguisher can block.  
- **Persistent (Stay in play):**  
  - **Pipet (Yellow)**: 2-for-1 trade (once per round; not same turn as 3-for-1).  
  - **Journal (Yellow)**: After scoring, keep 1 Element from Compound on Work Bench.  
  - **Graduated Cylinder (Yellow)**: In Lab Phase, move one Experiment down, another up.  
    - If Study lowered → remove excess Claim Tokens.  
    - If Lab lowered → reduce storage, discard excess Elements.  

#### Chemical Reactions  
- **Grant**, **Volatile**, **Hazardous Hauling**, **Corrosive Compound**, **Explosive Elements** — all detailed in Phase IV.  
- **Dual Chemical States**: If Compound has two colors, scientist chooses which Experiment to upgrade.  
- **Patent Thief (Lab Partners)**: Take 1 Element from a Work Bench and place on any Compound.  
- **Scientific Claim**: After scoring, move Claim Token to unclaimed Compound.  
- **Poison**: Give -3 AP to another player; may upgrade own Experiment.  

#### Lab Partners Variant  
- Add 2 Lab Partners cards to bottom of Research Field.  
- **Scoring Requirement**: Must have **2 Claim Tokens** on card (same or different players).  
- **Scoring**: Each claiming scientist gets full AP and one Experiment level. No double reward if one player has both.  
- **Explosions**: Elements scatter further — first to adjacent, then up to next row.  
- **Replenish**: Replace scored Lab Partners card with top of Lab Partners deck.  
- **Game End**: Immediate if cannot refill Lab Partners space.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Triggers:**  
- A) Scientist reaches 50 AP → one final round  
- B) Scientist completes 3 of 4 Experiments → one final round  
- C) Research Field cannot be filled → game ends immediately  

**Final Scoring:**  
- **Atomic Points on Score Track**  
- **+1 AP** for each Element on uncompleted **claimed Compounds**  
- **+1 AP** for every **2 Elements** on Work Bench (round down)  
- **+4 AP** for each **completed, unused Fire Extinguisher**  
- **+2 AP** for each **unused Wild Element Token**  

**Winner:** Scientist with most total AP.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you claim a Compound you didn’t complete?**  
  Yes, during Study Phase, if unclaimed and you have a Claim Token.  
- **Can you place Elements on a Compound with Flame Tokens?**  
  Yes, unless it has reached its limit (then it explodes when filled).  
- **Can two Lab Fires happen in one turn?**  
  No. Only one Lab Fire card can trigger per turn. But **Volatile Reaction** can trigger in same turn.  
- **What if a Compound explodes with no adjacent spaces?**  
  All Elements are discarded.  
- **Can you use Journal and Safety Goggles in same turn?**  
  Yes — Journal is Lab Phase, Safety Goggles is Research Phase.  
- **Can you use Bunsen Burner on a Compound at Flame limit?**  
  Yes — it will explode immediately.  
- **Can you use Fire Extinguisher against Bunsen Burner or Volatile?**  
  - **Bunsen Burner**: Yes — can prevent Flame Token.  
  - **Volatile**: No — acts like Lab Fire, but Extinguisher can still be used against resulting Flame Tokens.  
- **Can you use Pipet and 3-for-1 in same turn?**  
  No — only one trade per Research Phase.
