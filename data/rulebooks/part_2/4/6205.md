## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The game simulates strategic operations during World War II across Europe, focusing on supply, production, movement, and combat. Players control major powers (Axis and Allies) and aim to achieve victory through territorial control, resource dominance, and strategic warfare. Victory conditions vary by scenario, ranging from conquest of capitals to economic and political objectives.

2. Components  
- Game map with areas and sea zones  
- Unit counters (infantry, armor, cavalry, ground support units (GSUs), militia)  
- Fleet Points (Atlantic, Mediterranean, Baltic)  
- Strategic Assets (bombers, fighters, U-boats, ASW, V-weapons)  
- Turn Record Track  
- WERP (War Effort Resource Points) tracking  
- Special Action markers  
- Beachhead markers  
- Fleet transport status markers (Trans. Avail. / w/o Transport)  
- Force pools for each nation

3. Setup  
- **1939 Campaign Game**:  
  - Soviet Union deploys first in Soviet Home Areas.  
  - Poland deploys second in Poland (4-unit limit in Warsaw; border areas must have at least one unit).  
  - Italy deploys third in Italy, Albania, and Libya.  
  - France deploys fourth in France, French Levant, and French North Africa.  
  - Britain deploys fifth in Great Britain, Egypt, and Gibraltar.  
  - Germany deploys sixth (last) in Germany (max 3 ground units in East Prussia).  
  - United States deploys in Jan/Feb 1942 in the USA box.  
  - Minor Powers deploy when entering the war in their home countries.  
- **1941 Campaign Game**:  
  - Axis controls Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Western France, Yugoslavia, Greece (including Crete), and Poland (excluding Lvov and Brest-Litovsk).  
  - Soviet Union controls Baltic States, Lvov, Brest-Litovsk, Bessarabia.  
  - Vichy France declared; controls Southern France, North Africa, Levant.  
  - Britain controls Tobruk; other Libya is Axis.  
  - Play begins with Axis Production Phase.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each full turn consists of:
A. Weather Determination Phase (Nov/Dec & Mar/Apr only)  
B. Initial Supply Phase  
C. Production Phase  
D. Initial Operational Movement Phase  
E. Initial Strategic Movement Phase  
F. Initial Combat Phase  
G. Breakthrough Phase(s) (optional, repeatable)  
H. Final Supply Phase  
I. End of Turn Phase  

After Axis completes B–H, Allies conduct B–H. Then proceed to I.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Weather**: Determined by die roll in Nov/Dec and Mar/Apr; affects combat and movement.  
- **Supply**: Units must be in supply to survive. Out-of-supply units are eliminated in Final Supply Phase. Fleet Points provide sea supply.  
- **WERPs**: Used for production, replacements, and maintenance. Base production varies by nation and scenario.  
- **Production Phase**:  
  1. Calculate WERPs.  
  2. Resolve Strategic Warfare (e.g., bombing, U-boat raids).  
  3. Pay 1 WERP per supplied fleet for Naval Maintenance.  
  4. Produce units, replacements, or Special Actions with remaining WERPs.  
- **Movement**:  
  - Operational Movement: Units move per movement allowances; amphibious and airborne assaults possible.  
  - Strategic Movement: Units move up to national limit through friendly, uncontested areas.  
- **Combat**:  
  - Attacker chooses area and Normal or Assault (dice doubled) attack.  
  - Defender may Retreat Before Combat or Reinforce Battle.  
  - GSUs declare Dogfight or Ground Support (max 3 support).  
  - Dogfights resolve simultaneously (5+ removes unit).  
  - Combat: Defender fires first; casualties removed immediately.  
  - Counterattack possible if defender survives.  
- **Breakthrough Phases**: Spend Special Actions to conduct additional Operational/Strategic Movement or Combat.  
- **Naval Operations**:  
  - Interdiction: In Strategic Movement Phase; 1 FP per 2 enemy FPs required; 6+ inflicts step loss (5+ in Med if Malta/Sicily controlled).  
  - Naval Combat: Triggered by sea movement, retreats, or amphibious assaults. Equal fleets: 1d6 per FP, 6 hits. Larger fleet: excess FPs roll 5+ for hits. Losses prioritized by transport status.  
- **Special Actions**: Used for Breakthroughs or Unrestricted Replacements (allows full replacements in contested/enemy areas).

6. Scoring & End Game  
Victory conditions vary by scenario:
- **1939 Campaign (Sep '39–Dec '45)**:  
  - Axis Decisive: Conquer 2 Allied majors (France, Britain, USSR), no Allied control in Germany.  
  - Axis Operational: Germany unconquered, controls ≥10 resource areas.  
  - Axis Marginal: Germany unconquered, <10 resource areas.  
  - Allied Marginal: Germany conquered Jan–Jun 1945.  
  - Allied Operational: Germany conquered Jul–Dec 1944.  
  - Allied Decisive: Germany conquered before Jul 1944.  
  - Draw: No marginal victory.  
- **1941 Campaign (Jul '41–Dec '45)**: 27 turns; same victory conditions.  
- **Tournament Game (Jul '42–Oct '43)**: Victory Points (VPs) based on bomber hits, Italian morale, territory control. Most VPs wins; Allied win on tie.  
- **European War (Sep '39–Dec '41)**: VPs for territory control; most VPs wins.  
- **Patton’s Fantasy (Jul '45–Dec '45)**: Western Allies vs. USSR; victory based on German area control.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Vichy France**: Declared if Paris conquered and supply to Germany. Becomes Axis-controlled if Allies declare war or Italy surrenders.  
- **Italian Morale Collapse**: Triggered if Axis lacks African/Middle East control and doesn’t hold Gibraltar/Athens. Italian units lose hit bonuses; fleet cannot initiate combat.  
- **Italian Surrender**: Requires morale collapse, Allied control of Sicily, and control/contest of another Italian mainland area.  
- **Allied Beachhead in France**: Allows Italian units to operate in France; uncontested control from 1944 adds Free French to USA pool.  
- **First Russian Winter**: Axis infantry in USSR (except Finns/cadres) lose 1 step after first Jan/Feb production with Axis in Soviet areas.  
- **Lend-Lease**: USSR receives US/UK WERPs if at war with Germany and Paris controlled; reduced by Trondheim, Onega Swamps, or Persia control.  
- **U-Boat Raids**: Mandatory if Germany has U-boats; conducted during British Production Phase; reduces British WERPs and strategic moves.  
- **Bombing Raids**: Max damage = half of defender’s supplied home area WERPs. Interception required at thresholds (5+ bombers in Clear/Lt Mud, 10+ in Snow/Mud).  
- **Amphibious Assault**: Requires beachhead marker; only infantry may attack; beachhead placed if attackers survive first round.  
- **Airborne Assault**: Within two areas of origin or via air route; first round gives defender +1.  
- **Neutral Nations**: May be declared war upon during Operational Movement; conquered neutrals contribute 2 WERPs if supply line established.
