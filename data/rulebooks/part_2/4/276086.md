## Hamlet — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Hamlet is a strategic tile-placement and resource management game where players build a growing village by constructing buildings, refining resources, fulfilling market orders, and expanding their road network. The goal is to earn the most points through construction, landmarks, infrastructure, and end-game awards.

The game ends when either the Church is fully constructed or a player places their final landmark flag. Final scoring then determines the winner.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, perform the following in any order:

#### A. Stand Up Villagers  
Begin turn by standing all your villagers (they lie down after acting).

#### B. Move Donkeys (Once per turn)  
- Each standing donkey may move across 1 tile border (along paths).  
- After movement, stand all donkeys again.

Each standing villager may perform one action, then lies down.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Transportation  
- Goods move along your road network via "bucket brigade":  
  - From tile with your worker (villager/donkey) → adjacent tile with your worker.  
  - Goods can chain through multiple tiles.  
  - Donkeys allow goods to continue moving.  
- Goods consumed immediately upon arrival.  
- When others use your refined materials, you gain bonus (white = double).

#### Milestones  
Earned by being first to construct certain buildings. Grant special abilities or trigger tile availability:
- **Planner**: Score 2× points for each road built.
- **Merchant**: Score bonus for market sales.
- **Master (e.g., Master Stonemason)**: Enables high-quality refined materials.
- Claiming milestone dumps all related tiles into the bag.

#### Solo Mode (Botric)  
- Botric follows action line on Solo board.  
- Uses disc-drawing mechanism to determine actions.  
- Has fixed worker cost (5 coins per villager).  
- Gains discounts on Church construction.  
- Cannot perform Remote Purchases.  
- Ends game if final flag is placed or Church completed.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Triggers  
Game ends after current round when:
- Church is fully constructed, OR  
- A player places their final landmark flag (solo: Botric places last flag).

#### Final Scoring  

1. **Awards**  
   - Award points to top players in categories (e.g., most market sales, most church deliveries).  
   - Ties: Combine tied award values, split points, round down.  
   - Example: Tie for Chaplain → combine Chaplain + Sacristan points, split.

2. **Landmarks**  
   - Score points listed on each landmark you control (with your flag).  
   - Must be connected to road network unless tile says otherwise.  
   - (Solo): Botric’s landmarks worth 3 pts each regardless.

3. **Roads (Bridges)**  
   - Score 1 point per road built.  
   - With Planner milestone: 2 points per road.

4. **Longest Road**  
   - Find longest continuous path of your roads connecting building tiles.  
   - Cannot include Church.  
   - Score 2 points per building tile in the chain.

5. **Gold**  
   - Score 1 point per 3 gold remaining (round down).

#### Tiebreakers  
1. Most Church parts constructed  
2. Most Market Sale tiles fulfilled  
3. First to finish a pint of milk (or plant-based alternative)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can roads dead-end?**  
A: No. Roads cannot dead-end into mountains, forests, or water. Must connect to another building or road.

**Q: Can I build a building not connected to the road network?**  
A: Yes. Buildings do not need road connection, but roads cannot dead-end.

**Q: Can I transport goods without spending them?**  
A: No. Goods transported must be used immediately (e.g., for construction, activation).

**Q: Can I use coins earned during an action to pay for the same action?**  
A: Yes, if from consumed refined materials.

**Q: Can I use Remote Purchase to fulfill a Market Sale?**  
A: No. Market Sales must be fulfilled directly (worker must go to Market).

**Q: Do I have to use all my villagers each turn?**  
A: No. Use any number, but each can act only once.

**Q: What happens when the tile bag is empty?**  
A: Continue playing. No refills for blueprint slots or market.

**Q: Can I build a road between two tiles already connected by printed road?**  
A: No. Roads can only connect tiles not already connected.
