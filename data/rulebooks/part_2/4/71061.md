## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *DungeonQuest*, players take on the roles of Heroes braving the perilous Dragonfire Dungeon, built by the cunning Dragonlord Kalladra to lure greedy adventurers. The dungeon is filled with traps, monsters, and treasures. The objective is to gather loot, survive the dangers, and escape before the sun sets. The player with the highest total gold value from Loot cards wins. If no Hero escapes, Kalladra triumphs.

This document focuses on the **Alternate Combat Dice Variant**, a non-official rule modification that replaces traditional card-based combat with dice rolls using 12-sided dice, streamlining combat and enhancing Legendary monster uniqueness.

### 3. Setup  
Follow standard *DungeonQuest* setup:  
1. Place the game board.  
2. Shuffle all card decks and place them on designated spaces.  
3. Place Dungeon chambers facedown near the board.  
4. Place the sun token on the first space of the sun track.  
5. Shuffle Monster tokens facedown to form a pool.  
6. Each player selects a Hero, takes the corresponding figure, Power cards, and travel marker.  
7. Each player draws one Rune card.  
8. Determine the First Player by die roll; they receive the First Player token.  
9. First Player places their Hero in a Tower Room; others follow clockwise.  

Ensure each player has access to two 12-sided dice of the correct colors for combat.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Alternate Combat Dice Variant  
This variant replaces card-based combat with dice-based resolution.  

**Encountering Monsters**  
- Hero decides to escape or attack.  
- If escaping:  
  - Make a **Luck test** (roll 2d6; total ≤ Luck attribute = success).  
  - If successful, Hero escapes unharmed.  
  - If failed, Hero takes 2 wounds and combat begins.  

**Resolving Combat**  
- Combat proceeds in rounds until Hero or Monster is killed.  
- At the start of each round:  
  1. The **Hero player rolls two 12-sided dice**, one for each of the Monster’s assigned attributes (see table below).  
  2. Compare each die result to the Hero’s corresponding attribute.  

| Monster     | Required Attributes         |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Skeleton    | Agility & Armor             |
| Sorcerer    | Agility & Luck              |
| Golem       | Strength & Armor            |
| Troll       | Strength & Agility          |
| Demon       | Strength & Luck             |

- For each die:  
  - **Die > Hero’s attribute**: 1 wound to Hero.  
  - **Die = Hero’s attribute**: 1 wound to both Hero and Monster.  
  - **Die < Hero’s attribute**: 1 wound to Monster.  

- After resolving wounds:  
  - If neither is killed, begin a new combat round.  
  - If one is killed, combat ends.  

**Monster Player Role**  
- The player to the Hero’s left becomes the Monster player.  
- They draw a Monster token at random to determine the Monster’s life value.  
- They control Monster actions and track Monster wounds.  

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when:  
  - All Heroes have exited the dungeon, or  
  - All Heroes are dead.  

**Scoring**:  
- Surviving Heroes tally the gold value of their Loot cards.  
- Loot cards without a gold value are worth 0.  
- Highest total wins.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Highest single Loot card value.  
  2. Most Loot cards.  
  3. All tied players win.  

If no Hero escapes, **Kalladra wins**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a Hero escape during combat?**  
  No. Escape is only possible before combat begins.  
- **What if all Monster tokens of a type are in play?**  
  Move an existing token from the board to the new location.  
- **Do determination tokens apply to combat tests?**  
  No. The Alternate Combat Dice Variant uses no determination tokens.  
- **Can Heroes use abilities from other variants?**  
  Yes, if specified. See Character Abilities below.  
- **Solo Play**:  
  - The Hero player controls both Hero and Monster.  
  - Monster token is placed faceup so life value is known.  
  - Combat proceeds as normal.

### Character Abilities (Alternate Combat Dice Variant)  
- **Hugo the Glorious**: After rolling dice, may reroll one die; must accept the second result.  
- **Krutzbeck**: Whenever at least one wound is inflicted on the Monster, may inflict one additional wound.  
- **Tatiana**: If choosing to attack (not escape) when encountering a Monster, may roll 2 normal (6-sided) dice. Subtract lower from higher; deal that many wounds to Monster. If doubles, no damage. Then proceed to normal combat.  
- **Challara & Brightblaze**: If Hero has 8 or more wounds and rolls a die equal to their attribute (causing mutual wound), **no damage is dealt to the Monster** for that die in that round.
