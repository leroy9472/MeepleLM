## 2 de Mayo — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
**Lore**:  
*2 de Mayo* simulates the popular uprising in Madrid on May 2, 1808, against Napoleon’s French occupation forces. Civilians and a few Spanish military units rebelled in response to the French attempt to remove members of the Spanish royal family. The French, led by Marshall Joachim Murat, sought to crush the rebellion and regain control of key city access points. The game abstracts this conflict into a tense, fast-paced 10-turn struggle.

**Objective**:  
The game ends after Turn 10. The **French player wins** only if **all three** of the following conditions are met:  
- All Spanish units are eliminated.  
- All four access areas to Madrid (Areas 1, 6, 16, 20) are occupied by at least one French unit.  
- The French have lost fewer than 4 units (or fewer than 3 if the Spanish player has played the *Lieutenant Jacinto Ruiz* card).  

Otherwise, the **Spanish player wins**.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has four phases:

#### 1) Preparation Phase  
- Players may draw one card from their deck.  
- **Exception**: On Turn 1, no draw occurs—Spanish gets *José Blas Molina y Soriano*, French chooses between *Artillery* and *Murat*.  
- **Card Draw Restrictions**:  
  - If a player has **exactly 3 fewer cards** than their opponent, they may choose to draw, but only if the opponent also draws.  
  - If a player has **4 or more fewer cards**, they may draw and choose whether to allow the opponent to draw.  
- Cards marked “Play Immediately” must be played when drawn.

#### 2) Orders Phase  
Players secretly write movement orders (start → destination).  
- **French Player**:  
  - May write **up to 2 movement orders**.  
  - **Exception**: Any number of orders may originate from **Areas 14, 15, or 16** (main arteries).  
  - May split groups (e.g., 6 cubes in Area 14 → 1 to 7, 2 to 9, 3 to 15).  
  - Must fulfill all written orders with at least one unit.  
  - Moving reinforcements into Madrid counts as an order.

- **Spanish Player**:  
  - May order **all groups**.  
  - **May not split groups** unless using *The Mob Disperses* card.  
  - If splitting, must specify number of units per move.  
  - All written orders must be fulfilled.

#### 3) Movement Phase  
- Players simultaneously reveal orders.  
- Event Cards for this phase may now be played.  
- **Movement Execution**:  
  - Spanish moves first (for practical purposes), but movement is simultaneous.  
  - **French**:  
    - Cannot move out of contested areas.  
    - Chooses number of units per order **after** seeing Spanish movements.  
  - **Spanish**:  
    - May move out of contested areas but must **leave half (rounded up)** of the group behind.  
- **Swapping Conflict**:  
  - If two opposing groups attempt to swap areas (e.g., French 2→3, Spanish 3→2):  
    - Larger group moves in; smaller stays.  
    - Tiebreaker: side with **initiative** moves.  
    - Initiative = side that has eliminated more enemy units.  
    - If tied, Spanish has initiative.

#### 4) Resolution Phase  
- For each **contested area** (both French and Spanish units present):  
  - Compare **strength** = number of units + card modifiers.  
  - Apply **casualties** to the weaker group based on strength ratio:  
    - >1× but <2×: remove 1 unit  
    - ≥2×: remove 2 units  
    - ≥3×: remove 3 units  
    - (And so on—only highest applicable level applies.)  
  - If strengths are equal, no casualties.  
- After resolution, advance turn marker.  
- Game ends after Turn 10.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Group**: All units of one color in an area.  
- **Contested Area**: Contains both French and Spanish groups.  
- **Strength**: Units in group + modifiers from Event Cards.  
- **Initiative**: Determined by total enemy units eliminated. Spanish wins ties.  
- **Event Cards**:  
  - Take precedence over rules.  
  - No hand limit.  
  - May play multiple per phase if conditions met.  
  - Discarded after use unless specified.  
  - “Play Immediately” cards must be used when drawn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game ends after Turn 10**. Check French victory conditions:  
✅ All Spanish units eliminated  
✅ All access areas (1, 6, 16, 20) occupied by ≥1 French unit  
✅ French losses < 4 units (or < 3 if *Lieutenant Jacinto Ruiz* has been played)  

If **all three** are true → **French wins**.  
If **any one fails** → **Spanish wins**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can French move reinforcements before Turn 3?**  
  No. Reinforcements outside Madrid may only be given orders starting Turn 3.

- **What happens if a player writes invalid orders?**  
  The entire set of orders is **cancelled**.

- **Can French move into contested areas?**  
  Yes, but cannot **leave** them.

- **Does *Artillery* card affect all areas?**  
  No. When in play and **Areas 15 and 16 are both under French control**, Spanish units **cannot enter** these areas unless they become vacant or a card overrides this (e.g., *Los Presos de la Cárcel de la Corte*).

- **Can Spanish units move more than once per turn?**  
  No, unless a card (e.g., *Cavalry*) allows it.

- **What happens to *Artillery* if French lose control of 15 or 16?**  
  Effect is suspended. If both are later reoccupied, effect resumes.

- **Does initiative reset each turn?**  
  No. It is based on **cumulative** units eliminated.

- **Can players discard cards?**  
  Only if a card explicitly allows it (e.g., *French Sympathizers*).
