## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Escape from Colditz is a game inspired by real events at Colditz Castle during WWII, where Allied POWs attempted to escape German custody. The game captures the tension, planning, and cooperation required to orchestrate successful escapes.  

- **Escape Officers** (Allied players): Represent different nationalities (American, British, Dutch, French, Polish). Each aims to successfully escape two of their POWs from the castle.  
- **Security Officer** (German player): Represents the German guards tasked with preventing escapes by arresting POWs and managing security.  

The game ends when either:  
- Two POWs of the same nationality successfully escape (Escape Officer of that nationality wins), or  
- The round counter reaches the final space (eagle), and no Escape Officer has succeeded (Security Officer wins).  
If multiple Escape Officers achieve two escapes in the same round, they share victory.

2. Components  
- Game board of Colditz Castle  
- 2 dice  
- Round marker  
- 16 black pawns (German Guards)  
- 5 sets of 8 pawns (POWs):  
  - Americans (blue)  
  - British (red)  
  - Dutch (orange)  
  - French (brown)  
  - Polish (green)  
- 5 sets of Escape Attempt markers (by nationality)

- 5 Escape Kit cards  
- 5 Do or Die cards (used only in classic rules)

3. Setup  
- Decide total number of rounds (recommended: 50 for beginners, 40 or fewer for experienced players). Place round marker on that number.  
- One player becomes the **Security Officer**; others become **Escape Officers**, each choosing a nationality.  
- Set up POWs according to the Appel diagram based on player count:  
  - 2 players: 8 POWs per Escape Officer  
  - 3 players: 7 POWs each  
  - 4 players: 6 POWs each  
  - 5 players: 5 POWs each  
  - 6 players: 4 POWs each  
- Security Officer deploys:  
  - One Guard per Escape Officer to guard posts in the inner courtyard.  
  - Between 2 and 7 Guards to guard posts in the outer courtyard.  
  - Remaining Guards to the Barracks.  
- Place Escape Equipment cards face-up beside the board in separate piles.  
- Give each Escape Officer:  
  - One Escape Kit card  
  - One Opportunity card  
- Deal one Security card to the Security Officer.  
- Shuffle Security and Opportunity decks and place face-down.  
- **Six-player variant**: Remove 6 "Escape Kit (part)" cards from Opportunity deck, give to Security Officer face-down.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise, starting with the Escape Officer to the left of the Security Officer.  
- On a player’s turn:  
  1. Roll both dice for movement total.  
  2. Move pawns (POWs or Guards) using the total, split among any number of pawns.  
  3. Play cards, build equipment, attempt escapes.  
  4. If movement roll is 5 or lower, draw one card (Opportunity for Escape Officers, Security for Security Officer).  
  5. If doubles are rolled, re-roll and add to total (max two re-rolls). Escape Officers may also release one POW from solitary per double (cost: 1 movement).  
- Security Officer takes the last turn.  
- At end of Security Officer’s turn:  
  - Move Guards from Commander’s Office to Barracks.  
  - Advance round marker down one space.  
- When round marker reaches eagle (final space), all Escape Officers take one final turn. Game ends after that.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Movement**  
- Total movement = sum of two dice. Can be split freely among pawns.  
- Pawns cannot move through spaces occupied by other pawns.  
- Escape Officers: Rolling doubles allows release of one POW from solitary (cost: 1 movement per POW).  
- Security Officer: Can move Guards from Barracks to any guard post, or from any post to Commander’s Office (cost: 1 movement). Guards in Commander’s Office return to Barracks at end of turn.  
- "Directly" actions (e.g., returning POWs to Appel) do not use movement points.

**Cards**  
- Draw one card if movement roll is 5 or lower (Opportunity or Security). Only one card per turn.  
- Maximum hand size: 3 cards. If a fourth is drawn, must use or discard one by end of turn.  
- Cards are returned to bottom of deck when used or discarded.  
- Opportunity cards cannot be traded.  
- Security cards can be used at any time during turn unless marked "interrupt".  
- **Appel card**: Must be played before Security Officer’s movement roll. Escape Officers may ignore it; if so, Security Officer may instead perform a General Search.  

**General Search (via Appel card)**  
- Security Officer rolls dice.  
- Any POW within total dice range of a Guard is arrested.  
- Arrested POWs go to solitary; if outside inner courtyard, their Escape Officer discards one Equipment card.  
- Guards do not move.

**Arrest Rules**  
A POW may be arrested if:  
- Their Escape Officer holds Escape Equipment, **and** they are in the inner courtyard, or  
- They are outside the inner courtyard (regardless of equipment), or  
- They end movement on a guard post (Guard deployed there immediately arrests), or  
- They ignore an Appel card.  

**Arrest Procedure**  
- Guard moves into same space as POW.  
- POW sent to solitary:  
  - Inner courtyard arrest → inner solitary  
  - Outer courtyard or outside → outer solitary  
  - If one solitary is full, use the other.  
- Guard sent to Commander’s Office.  
- If arrested outside inner courtyard, Escape Officer discards one Equipment card.  
- Escape Officers may force arrest by moving a POW into a Guard.  

**POWs cannot be arrested in**:  
- Safe areas  
- Appel area  
- Undiscovered tunnels  
- Returning promptly from outer solitary without Equipment and using all movement toward inner courtyard  

**Equipment Cards**  
- Obtain by placing two POWs in rooms with matching symbol (same room or one in each of two rooms).  
- Declare creation, take card, return both POWs to any Appel space.  
- Can be traded freely between Escape Officers (except during Security Officer’s turn).  
- If a type runs out, cannot be made until another is discarded.  
- Using Equipment (e.g., rope, wire cutters) returns card to bottom of deck.

**Escape Kits**  
- Required for each escape.  
- Each Escape Officer starts with one.  
- To build a new one:  
  - Place one POW in each of four kit rooms (Food, Documents, Compass, Disguise) simultaneously, or  
  - Use Opportunity cards marked as kit parts, or  
  - Combine POW placements and cards.  
- Declare creation, take Escape Kit card, return POWs to Appel.  
- Only one Escape Kit may be held at a time.  
- Escape Kit cannot be confiscated.  
- Two POWs of same nationality may share one Escape Kit if they escape on the same turn.  
- **Six-player rule**: After each escape, Escape Officer draws one "Escape Kit (part)" card from separate pile.

**Escape Attempts**  
- POWs use Equipment to pass:  
  - Doors → Key  
  - Inspection points → Pass  
  - Wire fences → Wire cutters  
  - Drops → Rope (1 rope per 30 ft; 60 ft requires 2 ropes)  
- Using rope or wire cutters: Place Escape Attempt marker of nationality on that space.  
  - Allows access for that nationality and pursuing Guards.  
  - Guards may remove marker when moving over it; if so, must pursue or go to Commander’s Office.  
  - Other Escape Officers may replace marker by using Equipment.  
- POWs may retrace route (reverse direction) if marker is still present, but must spend additional Equipment.  
- Guards cannot move in reverse direction.

**Tunnels**  
- Open by playing matching Tunnel card and moving two POWs into tunnel.  
- Once open, usable by all nationalities.  
- Entry: marked space in inner courtyard; Exit: marked space in outer courtyard.  
- At least two POWs must remain in tunnel at end of each turn, or it collapses:  
  - Remaining POW sent to solitary.  
  - Tunnel unusable until card is played again.  
- Guards may only arrest tunnel POWs if Security Officer plays "Tunnel Discovered" card and follows instructions (move two Guards to tunnel).  
- Other pawns may move over tunnel spaces but cannot end turn there unless using the tunnel.

**Successful Escapes**  
- POW reaches any escape target outside castle.  
- Must have an Escape Kit.  
- After escape:  
  - Escape Kit is discarded (or shared if two escape same turn).  
  - Security Officer may remove all Escape Attempt markers of that nationality.  
  - Guards pursuing escaped POW outside castle return to Commander’s Office (if no other POWs in area).  
- **Six-player rule**: Escape Officer draws one "Escape Kit (part)" card.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Winning Condition**: First Escape Officer to get two of their POWs to escape targets wins.  
- If multiple achieve this in the same round, they share victory.  
- If no one succeeds by final round (eagle), Security Officer wins.  
- Game ends after final Escape Officers’ turns when round marker reaches eagle.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can Guards move through wire or drops?** Only if there is an Escape Attempt marker, and only in the direction of the marker.  
- **Can POWs move through other pawns?** Only when moving over POWs inside a tunnel.  
- **Can Equipment be used by multiple POWs?** Yes, in the same turn it is played.  
- **Can Escape Kit be traded?** No. It is held by the Escape Officer and not transferable.  
- **Can Opportunity cards be used out of turn?** Only if marked "interrupt".  
- **What if a die roll allows multiple effects?**  
  - Roll ≤5 and doubles: Can draw card and re-roll.  
  - Doubles: Re-roll and may release POW from solitary.  
- **Can a tunnel be reopened immediately after collapse?** Yes, if the Tunnel card is available and played again with two POWs.
