## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Kreta is set on the island of Crete in the 14th century. Players compete to gain the most influence and victory points by settling provinces with villagers, building villages and forts, controlling harbors with ships, and strategically deploying their abbot. The game ends after 11 scoring rounds, and the player with the most victory points wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board (16 provinces, 26 fort spaces, scoring track)  
- 26 fort cards (determine which provinces are scored)  
- 28 character cards (7 per player: King, Architect, Admiral, Commander, Castellan, Abbot, Farmer)  
- 4 round wooden markers (for scoring track)  
- 4 abbots (1 per player)  
- 8 ships (2 per player)  
- 12 forts (3 per player)  
- 16 villages (4 per player)  
- 20 villagers (5 per player)  
- 16 agriculture tiles (wheat, olive, wine, thyme, cheese)  
- 4 summary cards (player aids)

### 3. Setup  
- Place the board in the center.  
- Place agriculture tiles on provinces:  
  - 2 wheat → yellow provinces (fields)  
  - 8 olive/wine → green provinces (hills), placed randomly  
  - 6 thyme/cheese → brown provinces (mountains), placed randomly  
- Each player receives:  
  - 7 character cards (matching color)  
  - 1 marker (placed on “Start” of scoring track)  
  - 1 abbot, 2 ships, 3 forts, 4 villages, 5 villagers  
- Shuffle the 26 fort cards. Deal 11 face-down in a row below the board. Turn the 2 leftmost cards face-up.  
- Remaining fort cards form a draw pile.  
- Youngest player begins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Players take turns in clockwise order.  
- On your turn:  
  1. Play one character card face-up in front of you.  
  2. Perform the action associated with that card.  
- Cards stay played until a player plays the **Castellan** card.  
- You may not play a card if its action cannot be completed.  
- When a player plays **Castellan**:  
  - Scoring is triggered for the provinces adjacent to the fort space shown on the leftmost face-up fort card.  
  - After scoring, all players reclaim their played character cards.  
  - The player who played Castellan reveals the next fort card (from the face-down row) and may choose to keep it or replace it with the top card from the draw pile.  
  - Two face-up fort cards are always maintained.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Character Card Actions  

**Admiral**  
- Add one ship from supply to any harbor, or  
- Move one or both of your ships to any harbors.  
*Restrictions:*  
- You cannot place both your ships in the same harbor.  
- A harbor may hold up to 2 ships (1 in 2-player game).  

**Commander**  
- Add one villager from supply to any province, or  
- Move your villagers using up to 4 movement points.  
  - Each province-to-province move costs 1 movement point.  
  - Cannot move diagonally across round fort spaces.  
*Restriction:*  
- A province with 7 figures (villagers, villages, abbots) cannot receive new villagers or have villagers moved into it.  

**Abbot**  
- Place your abbot from supply into any province, or  
- Move your abbot up to 3 provinces.  
*Restrictions:*  
- Cannot enter a province with 7 figures.  
- While your abbot is in a province:  
  - Opponents cannot add villagers or villages.  
  - Opponents may still move figures through or into the province.  
  - If an opponent moves their abbot into the province, they may again add their own villagers/villages.  

**Farmer**  
- Harvest one agriculture tile if:  
  - You have a ship in a harbor adjacent to a province with your villager(s), and  
  - That province has an agriculture tile.  
- You may harvest from:  
  - The adjacent province, or  
  - Any province connected via a chain of your villagers back to the ship.  
- Place harvested tile face-up in front of you.  
- Score immediately:  
  - 1st of type: 1 VP  
  - 2nd: 2 VP  
  - 3rd: 3 VP  
  - 4th: 4 VP  

**Architect**  
- Build one fort on an empty fort space, or  
- Build one village in any province.  
*Restrictions:*  
- You may only build a village if you have previously harvested at least one agriculture tile.  
- Maximum villages = number of harvested agriculture tiles.  
- Cannot build a village in a province with 7 figures.  
- Cannot build a village in a province occupied by an opponent’s abbot unless your abbot is also present.  

**King**  
- Repeat the action of any character card you have already played (i.e., any card currently in front of you).  
- Example: If you previously played Commander and Admiral, you may choose to repeat either action.  

**Castellan**  
- Trigger scoring for the provinces adjacent to the fort space shown on the leftmost face-up fort card.  
- After scoring:  
  - All players reclaim their played character cards.  
  - Discard the used fort card.  
  - Reveal the next fort card from the row.  
  - You may keep it or replace it with the top card from the draw pile (only one replacement allowed).  
- This restores two face-up fort cards.

#### Influence & Scoring  
- Influence in a province is calculated as:  
  - Abbot: 1 point  
  - Villager: 1 point  
  - Village: 2 points  
  - Ship in adjacent harbor: 1 point  
  - Fort on bordering fort space: 1 point  
- Scoring:  
  - The player(s) with the most influence receive full victory points for the province.  
  - In 3- or 4-player games:  
    - Second place receives half the province’s points, rounded down.  
    - If multiple players tie for second, all receive half (rounded down).  
  - If there is a tie for first, no second-place points are awarded.  
- Province point values:  
  - Brown (mountains): 2 VP  
  - Green (hills): 3 VP  
  - Yellow (fields): 4 VP  
  - Harbors add 2 extra VP to adjacent provinces.  
- Not all provinces will be scored (only those adjacent to the 11 revealed fort cards).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends immediately after the 11th scoring round (i.e., after the 11th Castellan play).  
- The player with the most victory points wins.  
- Victory points come from:  
  - Harvesting agriculture tiles  
  - Scoring provinces during Castellan-triggered rounds  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I move through a province with 7 figures?**  
A: Yes, but you cannot end movement there. Only your abbot may legally enter or pass through such a province to potentially influence future actions.  

**Q: Can I build a fort in a full province?**  
A: Yes. Forts are built on border fort spaces, not inside provinces. However, the fort space must be empty.  

**Q: Can I harvest a tile from a province with an opponent’s abbot?**  
A: Yes, as long as you have a ship and a villager chain connecting to it. The abbot does not block harvesting.  

**Q: What happens if I play King but have no previously played cards?**  
A: You cannot play the King card unless you have at least one other character card already played.  

**Q: Can I move my abbot into a province with 7 figures?**  
A: No. The abbot cannot be placed or moved into a full province.  

**Q: Do I have to use all 4 movement points when playing Commander?**  
A: No. Movement points may be used partially or fully.  

**Q: Can I score more than once from the same province?**  
A: No. Each province is scored only once, if it is adjacent to one of the 11 active fort cards.
