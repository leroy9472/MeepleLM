Victory is determined by scoring points from surviving characters, antidotes, and food tokens.

   - Place Crossroads board with 3 roads around it.  
   - Place Water Tower board adjacent; place remaining 4 building boards in corners.  
   - Place Water Tower tile with non-collapsed side faceup.

3. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player receives:  
     - Summary card  
     - 6 movement cards  
     - 5 character standees of one color  
   - Determine first player: the player who "looks most like a zombie" takes first player token.  
   - Place zombie leader token on the wedge matching first player’s color.

     - 3 players: 5 per player  
     - 4 players: 4 per player  
     - 5–6 players: 3 per player  
   - All characters start rested (blue side up).

5. **Initial Placement**:  
   - Player to the right of first player draws movement cards equal to number of characters they control.  
   - Each player places one character per location shown on their drawn movement card.  
   - If location is full, place character on Crossroads.  
   - Proceed counter-clockwise (first player places last).

     - 3 players: 7 each  
     - 4 players: 6 each  
     - 5 players: 5 each  
     - 6 players: 4 each  
   - Alternatively, use draft method:  
     1. Deal full hand.  
     2. Each player chooses 1 card to keep, passes rest left.  
     3. Repeat until all have correct number of cards.  

7. **Invasion Deck**:  
   - Draw and reveal 00:00 invasion card; place indicated zombies.  
   - Randomly draw one card each from 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00 packs.

8. **Water Tower Side Rules**:  
   - Side A: Players with character on Water Tower may look at 1:00 invasion card.  
   - Side B: Such players choose movement card after others reveal theirs.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game round consists of 4 phases:

#### 1. Movement Card Selection  
- Each player secretly selects 1 movement card.  
- All reveal simultaneously.  
- With Water Tower side B: players on Water Tower reveal after others.  

#### 2. Invasion  
- Reveal top invasion card.  
- **Move zombies** as indicated (from one location to another). Max 8 zombies per location.  
- **Place new zombies**, airdropped action cards, and antidote tokens as shown.  
- **Move zombie leader token** if specified.  
- Water Tower and Crossroads never receive airdropped supplies.  

#### 3. Character Movement  
- Starting with first player, then clockwise:  
  - Choose one character and move to location shown on selected movement card.  
  - Character cannot move to its current location.  
  - If destination is full, place character on Crossroads.  
  - A character may attempt to move to a full location and end up on Crossroads.  

#### 4. Location Resolution  
Process each of the 6 locations in order (1 to 6). Once resolved, do not return.  

##### A. Activation  
- Players with at least one character at location may use its effect in turn order.  
- Each player may use a location only once per turn, even with multiple characters.  

##### B. Zombie Attack  
- All players may play action cards, use character powers, or form alliances to kill zombies (even without character present).  
- After no further actions, if zombie attack conditions are met, attack occurs.  
- Players at location vote for which character dies:  
  - 1 vote per character controlled at location.  
  - First player token holder breaks ties.  
- **Voting Procedure**:  
  - All eligible players raise hand.  
  - Count "1... 2... 3" and point simultaneously.  
  - Cannot split multiple votes.  
  - Player chosen must have character at location.  
- Action cards/powers cannot be used after vote to alter outcome.  

##### C. Sharing  
- If action cards or antidotes are present, vote to determine who distributes them.  
- All players (even absent) may negotiate.  
- Vote: 1 vote per character at location.  
- Winner:  
  - May look at face-down action cards.  
  - Must distribute all items (can give to players not present).  
  - Each player receives at most 1 item per sharing.  
  - Excess items remain on location for future sharing.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action Cards  
- Can be played at any time except immediately after a vote.  
- Placed in discard pile after use.  
- May be played anywhere, even without character present.  
- Cards with explosion symbol: add explosion marker to Water Tower or Armory **only if used for effect**. Discarding to trigger other effects does not add marker.  
- Discard pile is public.  

#### Character Powers  
- Can be used at any time except after a vote.  
- Only rested (blue side up) characters may use powers.  
- After use, flip to exhausted (red) side.  
- Exhausted characters worth fewer victory points.  
- Exceptions:  
  - Church and Energy Drink can flip characters back.  
  - Pregnant Woman **cannot** be flipped back once exhausted.  

#### Water Tower & Armory Explosions  
- **Water Tower**:  
  - On 3rd explosion marker, flip to exploded side.  
  - Remove all characters and zombies there.  
  - Return explosion markers to box.  
  - Explodes only once per game.  
- **Armory**:  
  - Side A: 3 explosion markers → Armory burns down. Move all characters to Crossroads; place fire markers on spaces. Zombies remain.  
  - Side B: 2 explosion markers → door blocked. No entry/exit for characters. Zombies may still attack.  
- After Water Tower explodes, new explosion markers go to Armory.  
- When Armory is full, markers go back to Water Tower.  

#### Crossroads Zombie Attack  
- No vote. Victim color determined by zombie leader token.  
- If no character of that color is present, move token clockwise (skip grey caches) until matching player has character.  
- After victim eaten, move token 1 space clockwise.  
- If all characters at Crossroads are hidden, no one is eaten and token does not move.  

#### Hidden Characters  
- Hidden characters (e.g., via HIDEOUT card) count toward zombie attack thresholds.  
- Cannot vote or be selected (eaten, shared items).  
- Stand up at end of turn.  

#### Negotiations & Trades  
- Players may freely trade action cards, antidotes, and information.  
- Promises about current location **must be respected**.  
- Promises about future actions **are not binding**, unless house-ruled otherwise.  

#### Cancellation Effects  
- Must be played immediately when target card is played.  
- Examples: before Little Cat’s destination is drawn, before explosion marker placed.  
- All cards, including Canned Food at game end, can be cancelled.  

#### Food Tokens  
- Discarded food tokens are removed from the game.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After 4:00 invasion phase, rescue helicopter arrives.  

1. **Antidote Requirement**:  
   - Discard 1 antidote per living character.  
   - Characters without antidote die immediately.  

2. **Scoring**:  
   - Each living character: worth value on card (current side).  
   - Each remaining antidote: 1 point.  
   - Each food token: points as shown on token.  
   - Player with no living characters scores **0 points**.  

3. **Winning**:  
   - Highest score wins.  
   - Tie: player with most living characters wins.  
   - Further tie: all tied players win.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

- **Character Death & First Player Token**:  
  - When a player loses a character, they gain first player token.  
  - If multiple characters die simultaneously (e.g., Water Tower explosion), first victim in turn order gets token.  
  - Player losing last character is eliminated. Next player clockwise gets first player token.  

- **Explosion Marker Placement**:  
  - Only when playing a card **for its effect** with explosion symbol.  
  - Discarding such a card for another card’s trigger does **not** add marker.  

- **Movement Card Conflicts**:  
  - Cannot move to current location.  
  - If all spaces full, go to Crossroads.  
  - BACK DOOR and Mama allow temporary overcapacity.  

- **Voting Clarifications**:  
  - Cannot vote for player without character at location.  
  - Player may vote for themselves.  
  - All votes revealed simultaneously.  

- **Location Effects with Sides**:  
  - Church: Side A uses action card; Side B uses food token to rest character.  
  - Armory: Side A draws from deck; Side B takes from discard.  
  - Hospital: Side A uses action card; Side B exhausts character to get antidote.  
  - Bank: Side A moves leader anywhere; Side B moves up to 1 space.  
  - Crossroads: Side A draws random food; Side B draws from 3 faceup or facedown.
