## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Impulse*, players command fleets exploring a galactic sector, aiming to earn 20 Space Prestige points to win. Points are earned through combat, controlling key locations, and resource conversion. Players are eliminated if they lose all ships.

2. Components  
- 108 Action Cards (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow; sizes 1, 2, 3)  
- Sector Core Card  
- 6 Command Center boards (one per player/race)  
- 78 Ship tokens (13 per color)  
- Space Prestige Board  
- Impulse Marker  
- Colorblind Aid  
- General Reference Cards  

3. Setup  
- Each player selects a race and takes matching Command Center and ships.  
- Place 1 ship on the 0 of the Space Prestige Board.  
- Shuffle 108 Action Cards; deal 5 to each player.  
- Place Sector Core card at map center; arrange starting Home Location cards as per player count (positions vary for 2–6 players).  
- Each player chooses one of six starting cards as their Home Location, places it face-up, and deploys:  
  - 2 Transports (standing) on the card center  
  - 1 Cruiser (lying down) on the gate facing the Sector Core  
- Impulse starts empty. First player receives the game box (used as Impulse tray).

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn follows this order:  
1. Add a card from hand to the bottom of the Impulse (mandatory unless hand is empty).  
2. Use one of your two Techs (optional).  
3. Execute each Impulse card in order (oldest to newest).  
4. Use or delay your Plan:  
   - If Plan has 4+ cards, must use.  
   - Execute cards in order, then discard entire Plan.  
5. Score 1 point per gate where your Cruiser fleet patrols the Sector Core.  
6. Draw 2 cards (up to hand limit of 10). Trim Impulse to 3 cards by discarding the oldest (top).  
7. If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Ships**:  
  - Transport: stands on card center; activates card when moved.  
  - Cruiser: lies on gate; patrols adjacent cards.  
  - Fleet: one or more Transports on a card or Cruisers on a gate.  
- **Control**:  
  - Occupy: have Transport on a card.  
  - Patrol: have Cruiser on a gate (controls both adjacent cards).  
- **Movement**:  
  - Transports move card-to-card; cannot enter patrolled cards.  
  - Cruisers move gate-to-gate through patrolled cards; cannot move through enemy-patrolled cards unless starting a battle.  
  - Fleets may leave ships behind; must move together otherwise.  
  - Exploring: moving onto face-down cards. Draw card into hand, replace with one from hand.  
- **Actions** (all optional, "up to" values):  
  - Build: Construct ships as specified. Max 12 ships per player.  
  - Command: Move ships.  
  - Draw: Draw cards (max hand size 10, except during explore).  
  - Execute: Use a card from hand or activate a Tech. Discard card if from hand.  
  - Mine: Tuck cards under Command Center (Minerals); only gems (size icons) visible.  
  - Plan: Add cards to your personal Plan (right side of Command Center).  
  - Refine: Discard Mineral cards for points equal to their size.  
  - Research: Replace a Tech with a new one (from hand or deck).  
  - Sabotage: Destroy enemy ships on cards you occupy or patrol. Reveal one card per bomb; each size 2+ card destroys 1 ship (1 point each).  
  - Trade: Discard cards from hand for points equal to size.  
- **Boosting**:  
  - Boxed numbers in actions are boosted by:  
    - 1 per 2 matching-color gems in your Minerals (rounded down).  
    - 1 per 2 Transports just moved onto a card (for map card activations).  
  - Boosts calculated before action resolution.  
- **Battles**:  
  - Triggered when two Cruiser fleets share a gate. Ends movement.  
  - Steps:  
    1. Defender plays face-down reinforcement cards (matching size and color of any card in Impulse, Plan, or Techs). Bluffs allowed.  
    2. Attacker does the same.  
    3. Reveal all reinforcements. Return bluff cards (non-matching) to owners’ hands.  
    4. Each player draws 1 card per Cruiser in battle and adds their size icons to total.  
    5. Player with most total icons wins (defender wins ties).  
    6. Loser discards all ships in the battle.  
    7. Winner gains 1 point for victory + 1 point per ship destroyed.  
    8. Discard all reinforcement and drawn cards.  
- **Hand Limit**: Max 10 cards. Only exceeded during exploration.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Scoring Sources**:  
  - +1 per battle won.  
  - +1 per enemy ship destroyed (battle, sabotage, or movement).  
  - +1 per gate patrolled at Sector Core at end of turn.  
  - +1 per size icon when Trading cards.  
  - +1 per gem (size) when Refining Minerals.  
  - Activating Sector Core with Transports (choose mineral color to boost).  
- **Game End**:  
  - Immediate win at 20 points (even mid-turn).  
  - If a player has no ships, they are eliminated. Game ends if only one player remains.  
  - In team games, any teammate reaching 20 wins for the team.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Hand Limit**: Cannot draw beyond 10 unless exploring. After exploration, return to 10.  
- **Bluffing in Battle**: Non-matching reinforcement cards are returned after reveal.  
- **Plan Delay**: Can delay if <4 cards; must use if ≥4.  
- **Ties in Battle**: Defender wins.  
- **Sabotage Overkill**: Only score points equal to ships destroyed (e.g., 4 hits on 2 ships = 2 points).  
- **Tech Replacement**: Basic Techs are discarded when replaced; cannot be recovered.  
- **Exploration**: Must declare full move before exploring. Explore one card at a time.  
- **Team Play**: Share Impulse; no battles between teammates; points tracked individually; team wins if any member hits 20.
