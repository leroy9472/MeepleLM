## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the years after Catan was settled, the growing population demanded a central trade hub. The people founded Elasund—a city with ports, markets, churches, and homes for craftsmen and traders. Players compete to develop the city by constructing buildings, expanding trade, and gaining influence. The first player to place all 10 victory point markers wins.

2. Components  
- 1 Game board  
- 40 Victory point cubes (10 per player in 4 colors)  
- 4 Round counters (1 per player)  
- 2 Dice  
- 1 Ship  
- 37 Buildings:  
  - 16 player-colored buildings (4 per player: worker, dealer, craftsman, and one unique)  
  - 21 Neutral buildings (pub, market stall, meeting hall, throne room, trading office, etc.)  
- 9 Small church tiles  
- 36 City wall pieces (9 per player color)  
- 90 Cards:  
  - 51 Gold cards  
  - 39 Influence cards  
- 2 City gates  
- 4 Turn overview cards (1 per player)  
- 20 Building permits (5 per player)

3. Setup  
- Place the game board centrally.  
- Determine city size using city gates:  
  - 2 players: Gates on "2" sites (white arrows)  
  - 3 players: Gates on "3" sites (grey arrows)  
  - 4 players: Gates on "4" sites (black arrows)  
  - Align gates so blue arrows point toward the sea.  
- Each player selects a color and receives:  
  - 10 Victory point cubes  
  - 5 Building permits  
  - 4 Buildings (in player color)  
  - 1 Turn overview card  
  - 9 City wall pieces (stacked in ascending order, "9" at bottom)  
  - 1 Round counter (placed on "0" of trade track)  
- Place starting tiles:  
  - Each player places their 2 small starting tiles (with totem) on the launching fields matching their color, arrow pointing north (toward wind rose).  
- Church tiles: Shuffle the 9 small church tiles and place face-down beside the church illustration.  
- Neutral buildings: Sort into piles by type and place beside the board.  
- Cards:  
  - Shuffle influence cards and place face-down.  
  - Place gold cards in open supply piles.  
- Deal starting resources: Each player receives 3 gold and 1 influence card.  
- Place ship and dice near the board.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn consists of four phases in order:  
1. Roll dice for income (all players)  
2. Build once or twice  
3. Place a building permit or take 2 gold  
4. Take a bonus action (optional)

5. Core Mechanics  
a) Dice Roll & Income  
- Active player rolls both dice. Move ship to the corresponding row.  
- If the same number is rolled as last turn, move ship 2 rows up or down.  
- For each building a player owns in the ship’s row:  
  - Gold-marked building → receive 1 gold card  
  - Influence-marked building → receive 1 influence card  
- If a "7" is rolled:  
  - Move ship to any other row (pirate mode).  
  - No income is earned.  
  - Each player discards 1 card (gold or influence) per victory point they have in that row.  
  - The player who moved the ship may take 1 card per watchtower (wall tile with victory point) they own from the discarded cards.

b) Build Phase  
A player may build up to two of the following:  
- Own or neutral building  
- City wall section  
- Church tile  

Building Requirements:  
- Pay construction cost in gold.  
- Construction area must have sufficient building permits (own or others’) equal to or exceeding the building’s size (1, 2, or 4 fields).  
- The player with the highest total value of building permits in the area has priority.  
- If tied, no one may build there.  

Using Other Players’ Permits:  
- Must pay each affected player gold equal to the value of their permit.  
- Must also pay construction cost.  
- Return permits to their owners after building.

Displacement Rules:  
- Larger buildings displace smaller ones entirely or partially within their footprint.  
- Displaced player buildings return to owner.  
- Displaced neutral buildings return to stack; victory points are returned.  
- Starting tiles (huts) must be immediately re-placed on free fields (not on trade fields or under permits). If no space, removed from game.  
- Equal-sized buildings may be displaced only by spending 3 influence cards of the same color.

Building Specifics:  
- City Walls:  
  - Place on city gate side or adjacent to existing wall.  
  - Cost: 2 gold (blue arrow side), 4 gold (red arrow side).  
  - If wall shows influence symbols, take that many influence cards.  
  - If wall has tower, place 1 victory point.  
- Church:  
  - Costs 7 gold. Draw top church tile.  
  - First builder draws two tiles, chooses one, places it on excavation (arrow north), returns other to bottom.  
  - Subsequent tiles must be placed in correct relative position (per large church diagram).  
  - Church tiles cannot be displaced.  
  - If building or permit is under church tile, remove it.  
  - Building permits may be placed in church area, and buildings may be built (though rarely useful).

c) Place Permit or Take 2 Gold  
- Place one building permit on any free field in the ship’s row.  
  - Pay gold equal to the permit’s number.  
- If no space in ship’s row, place in nearest free row above or below.  
- Alternative: Play 2 influence cards of same color to place permit in any row.  
- Or, skip and take 2 gold instead.

d) Bonus Actions (Choose one, optional)  
Costs must be paid in influence cards and/or gold.  
1. Move Own Permit: Move one of your permits to any free space.  
   - Cost: 2 same-color influence cards  
2. Upgrade Own Permit: Replace an existing permit with a higher-numbered one from your supply.  
   - Cost: 2 same-color influence cards + gold equal to difference in values  
3. Place Permit Anywhere: Place a permit from your supply on any row.  
   - Cost: 3 different-color influence cards + gold equal to permit’s value  
4. Take 2 Gold: Take 2 gold from supply.  
   - Cost: 1 influence card of each color (3 different colors)

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Victory Points:  
  - Placed when building neutral buildings (1 or 2 per building).  
  - Placed on city wall towers.  
  - Earned via trade track:  
    - Trade Fields:  
      - Port fields: +1 trade point per building  
      - City gate fields (3/4 players): +2 trade points per building  
    - Round counter advances on trade track.  
    - Place 1 victory point when counter reaches or passes 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11.  
    - If building on trade field is lost, counter moves back. If it drops below a milestone, remove corresponding victory point.  
- Game ends immediately when any player places their 10th victory point.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Rolling 7: Ship becomes pirate. No income. Players discard cards per victory point in row. Builder collects cards via watchtowers.  
- Card Supply Runs Out:  
  - Shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  
  - If still insufficient, players keep earned income but receive nothing if deck empty.  
  - Gold: Same rule.  
- Starting Tile Re-placement:  
  - If multiple displaced, re-place clockwise starting from player to the left of builder.  
  - If a player displaces their own hut, re-place it immediately (not considered a build action).  
  - All huts must be re-placed before turn continues.  
- Church Tile Placement: Cannot be covered or displaced. Determines fixed build area once first tile is placed.
