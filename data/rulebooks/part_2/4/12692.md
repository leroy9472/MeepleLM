## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the gloomy world of Gloom, tragedy is the norm—cold tea, debt, disease, and packs of rabid mice plague everyday life. The game revolves around eccentric families who endure misfortune so great that their reward lies only in death. Players control a family of misfits, aiming to maximize their characters’ suffering before death. The goal is to have the lowest total Family Value at the end of the game, calculated from the visible Pathos points on your dead characters. You lower your characters' Self-Worth with tragic events and hinder opponents by improving their characters’ lives (raising their Self-Worth).

2. Components  
- 20 Character cards (5 per base family, 4 families)  
- 58 Modifier cards  
- 12 Event cards  
- 20 Untimely Death cards  
- Expansion content (optional):  
  - Unhappy Homes: 5 Residence cards, Mystery cards  
  - Unwelcome Guests: Unwelcome Guest cards, Persistent Effect icons  
  - Unfortunately Expeditions: Expedition cards  
  - Unquiet Dead: Story cards  

3. Setup  
- Choose a Family: Each player selects one family (Castle Slogar, Hemlock Hall, Blackwater Watch, or Dark's Den of Deformity), taking its 5 Character cards. Families not chosen are set aside.  
- Place Characters: Each player places their 5 Character cards face up in front of them.  
- Prepare Deck: Shuffle all non-Character cards (Modifiers, Events, Untimely Deaths, and any expansion cards) into a draw pile.  
- Draw Hands: Each player draws 5 cards from the draw pile to form their starting hand.  
- Starting Player: The player who has had the worst day goes first. If unclear, the game owner starts. Play proceeds clockwise.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, follow these steps in order:  
1. First Play: You may:  
   - Play an Event card  
   - Play a Modifier card on any character (your own or opponent’s)  
   - Play an Untimely Death card on any character with a negative Self-Worth  
   - Discard a card  
   - Pass  
2. Second Play: You may:  
   - Play an Event card  
   - Play a Modifier card on any character  
   - Discard a card  
   - Pass  
   - (Note: Untimely Death cards **cannot** be played on the second play.)  
3. Draw Phase: Draw cards until your hand reaches your current draw limit (normally 5). If the draw pile is empty, reshuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.  

Storytelling is encouraged but optional—players narrate how each tragic or joyful event unfolds.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Character Cards**: Represent family members. Start with no Self-Worth. Are played face up. When killed, flipped over (skull visible) and set aside with all attached cards.  
- **Modifier Cards**: Transparent cards with black text. Add or subtract Pathos points (up to 3 values along the left edge) to a character’s Self-Worth. May include:  
  - **Pathos Points**: Sum all visible values to determine current Self-Worth.  
  - **Story Icons**: Indicate thematic content; may interact with other cards:  
    - Beast (dangerous animals)  
    - Blank (nullifies previous icon)  
    - Death (disease/supernatural)  
    - Duck (humiliation/jokes)  
    - Goblet (food/poison/feasts)  
    - Lucre (money)  
    - Marriage (relationships)  
    - None (lets prior icon show through)  
  - **Special Effects**:  
    - Immediate: Trigger when played (e.g., “draw 2 cards”).  
    - Continuous: Active as long as the effect text is visible (e.g., “draw limit +1”).  
    - Effects apply to the character’s **controller**, not the player who played the card.  
- **Event Cards**: Red text, single-use. Played and discarded. Have immediate effects (e.g., “return a character from the dead”). Most can only be played on your turn, but some (e.g., “Second Chance”, “Smoke and Mirrors”) can be played as reactions during another player’s turn.  
- **Untimely Death Cards**: White text. Can only be played during the **first play** of your turn. May only be played on a character with **negative Self-Worth**. When played:  
  - Character is flipped to deceased side (skull visible)  
  - Untimely Death card is placed on top  
  - Entire stack is set aside  
  - No further Modifiers can be played on the character  
  - Only certain Event cards affect dead characters  
  - Only **visible** Pathos points count at scoring  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Condition**: The game ends **immediately** when one player has no living characters (i.e., their entire family is dead).  
- **Scoring**:  
  - For each of your **dead** characters, total all **visible Pathos points** on their stack.  
  - Living characters and opponents’ dead characters do not contribute.  
  - Sum these values to get your **Family Value**.  
- **Winning**: The player with the **lowest** Family Value wins. Ties are possible and valid.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you play an Untimely Death on the second play?**  
  No. Only during the first play.  
- **Can you play Event cards out of turn?**  
  Only if the card says “Cancel… as it is played” (e.g., “Second Chance”, “Smoke and Mirrors”).  
- **What happens to a Guest’s base Pathos points when killed?**  
  They still count. Do **not** flip Guest cards—only flip true Character cards.  
- **Does a continuous effect activate if covered immediately?**  
  No. If a Modifier with a continuous effect (e.g., “draw limit +1”) is covered, the effect is inactive until revealed.  
- **What if a Modifier’s effect says “When this is played” but is moved, not played?**  
  The effect does **not** trigger. Only triggered when initially played.  
- **Unwelcome Guests movement vs. game end**:  
  If a Guest (e.g., Unhappy Holmes) would move due to a death, the move happens **before** the game ends. It’s possible for a player to end up with one living Guest after all their characters die, delaying the end.  
- **Free Plays**:  
  Certain cards (e.g., “Marooned on the Moors”) grant a free play of an Untimely Death. This overrides normal play restrictions and can be used on your turn.  
- **Ties**:  
  If two or more players tie for lowest Family Value, the game is a tie.
