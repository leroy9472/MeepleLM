## HANGING GARDENS — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Hanging Gardens is a strategic tile-laying and set collection game where players build ornate gardens using building cards, aiming to claim and score point tiles based on symbol groups and set completion. The goal is to earn the most points by strategically placing cards, forming connected symbol groups, and collecting valuable point tiles.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Blank starting grid card per player  
- 5 Temples per player (in player’s color)  
- 60 Building Cards (featuring symbols: Arcade, Fountain, Park, Terrace)  
- 49 Point Tiles, including:  
  - Chalice, Garden, Status, Tiger, Gate  
  - Person Tiles: Priest, Gardener, Sculptor, Handler, Guard, King, Queen  
  - Each tile type quantity shown in upper right (à la Bohnanza)  
  - Each type has 1 Person Tile except King and Queen (4 each)  
- 2 face-down stacks of Point Tiles  
- 6 face-up Point Tile display spaces  
- 1 Start Player Flower  

### 3. Setup  
- Give each player a blank grid card and 5 temples of their color.  
- Shuffle the 60 Building Cards into a deck.  
- Shuffle the 49 Point Tiles and divide into 2 roughly equal face-down stacks.  
- Draw 1 tile face up into each of the 6 tile display spaces.  
- Randomly choose the start player; give them the start player flower.  

**2-Player Variant – Starter Turns:**  
- Deal 4 cards: Start player takes 1, second player takes 1, discard the other 2.  
- Deal 4 more cards: Second player chooses first, start player takes the second.  
- Then proceed to regular gameplay.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds in rounds. Each round has three phases:

#### 1. Draw Cards  
- **2 Players:** Reveal 4 Building Cards face up.  
- **3 Players:** Reveal 3 Building Cards face up.  
- **4 Players:** Reveal 4 Building Cards face up.  

#### 2. Player Turns  
- **3–4 Players:** Each player takes 1 turn, starting with the current start player and proceeding clockwise.  
- **2 Players:** Each player takes 2 turns, alternating one at a time (total of 4 turns per round).  

On your turn, do **one** of the following actions:

##### A) Take 1 Display Card Into Your Play Area  
- Place the card on your grid so that each symbol on the card covers:  
  - An empty space on the grid, OR  
  - A symbol on a card already placed below it.  
- **Restrictions:**  
  - No symbol may hang over empty table (i.e., must be supported).  
  - Only empty grid spaces may be directly over the table.  
  - A card cannot cover or displace a placed Temple.  
  - A card must be fully supported by the grid or lower cards.  
- If **no card** can be legally placed in your area:  
  - Remove any one card from the display (as your turn).  

##### B) Earn 1 Point Tile for Group of 3 or More Matching Symbols  
*(Optional – may be delayed)*  
- Triggered only if the card **you just placed** creates an orthogonally connected group of **3 or more matching symbols**.  
- The new group **must include** at least one symbol from the just-placed card.  
- You may place a Temple on **any symbol** in the newly formed group (not necessarily on the new card).  
- **Restrictions:**  
  - Cannot place a Temple on a group that already has one.  
  - If all 5 Temples are in use, **move one** from your smallest existing group (choose among ties).  
- After placing the Temple, take **one** face-up Point Tile from the display that matches the symbol type of the group (e.g., Garden group → take a Garden or Gardener tile).  
- You may score **only one group per turn** this way.  
- **Refill** the empty tile display space immediately from the face-down stacks.  

#### 3. Next Player  
- Pass the start player flower to the left.  
- Refill the Building Card display to the correct number (3 or 4).  
- Begin the next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Placement:** Must follow support rules (no floating symbols).  
- **Symbol Groups:** Orthogonal connections only. Diagonals don’t count.  
- **Temple Use:** Used to claim groups. Only one Temple per group. Reusable via repositioning.  
- **Point Tile Acquisition:** Must form group of 3+ matching symbols with your placed card.  
- **Tile Display:** Always maintain 6 face-up tiles. Refill immediately when taken.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End  
The game ends immediately when **one** of the following occurs:  
1. All Building Cards have been played or removed.  
2. All Point Tiles have been claimed (rare).  
   - In this case, finish the current round.  
   - Any player who needs a missing tile (for scoring) gets **5 points** instead.  

#### Final Scoring (in order)  
Score each player individually:

1. **Score Point Tiles by Type**  
   - Group tiles by type (e.g., Garden, Chalice).  
   - Set aside **Person Tiles** (marked with “1” in top right).  
   - Score sets using the **bottom row numbers** on the tiles.  
     - 1 tile = 1st number, 2 tiles = 2nd number, etc.  
     - You may form **multiple sets** of the same type.  
   - Example: Garden tiles score 2-8-16. With 5 tiles:  
     - 1 full set of 3 → 16 points  
     - Remaining 2 tiles → 8 points  
     - Total = 24  

2. **Guard Bonus**  
   - If you own the **Gate Person Tile**, earn **3 points per Gate tile** you own.  

3. **Person Tiles Scoring**  
   - For each Person Tile (e.g., Gardener, Priest):  
     - If you have **one or more complete sets** of the corresponding Point Tile type, score the **rightmost value**.  
     - If you have **no complete set**, score the **leftmost value**.  
     - Multiple complete sets do **not** increase value.  
   - Example: Gardener tile has values 4 / 11. With 3+ Garden tiles → score 11. With 0, 1, or 2 → score 4.  

4. **Tiebreaker**  
   - Highest total score wins.  
   - If tied, the player with the **most total tiles** (all Point Tiles) wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I score a group without taking a tile?** No – scoring occurs only when you take a tile by placing a Temple.  
- **Can I score more than one group per turn?** No – only one group per turn may be scored.  
- **Can I place a card that doesn’t create a group?** Yes – as long as it follows placement rules.  
- **What if I can’t place any card and no card fits?** You may remove one card from the display as your turn.  
- **Can I move a Temple to a larger group I just formed?** Yes – if all Temples are in use, you must move one from a smaller group.  
- **Do I have to score immediately when forming a group?** No – optional. You may wait to form a larger group.
