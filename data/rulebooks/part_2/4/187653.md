### 1. Lore & Objective
In Covert, players take on the roles of elite spies operating across Europe during the Cold War era. Each leads a covert team, gathering intelligence, breaking enemy codes, and completing high-stakes missions for their agency. The goal is to earn the most points by completing Mission Cards and successfully breaking Code Cards. The game ends when a player completes their sixth Mission, triggering the final scoring phase.

### 2. Components
- 1 Game Board  
- 20 Dice (5 of each of 4 player colors)  
- 12 Agent Pawns (3 of each of 4 player colors)  
- 60 Intel Cubes (15 of each of 4 player colors)  
- 48 Agency Cards  
- 60 Mission Cards  
- 6 Character Cards  
- 4 Player Screens  
- 4 Turn Order Tokens (numbered 1–4)  
- 4 Reroll Tokens  
- 12 Cipher Tokens  
- 40 Code Cards  
- 16 Special Operations Tokens  
- 1 Bag  

### 3. Setup
1. Place the board in the center of the table.  
2. Each player:
   - Randomly receives (or mutually agrees on) one Character Card, which grants a unique special ability.
   - Takes a Player Screen and all components in one color: 5 Dice, 3 Agent Pawns, 1 Reroll Token, and 15 Intel Cubes.
3. Shuffle the Agency Cards. Each player, in turn, draws three Agency Cards and places one of their Agents in the city matching each card’s region. These are starting positions.
   - **Two-player game only**: Use six Intel Cubes each from the two unused colors. Draw 12 Agency Cards one at a time, placing an Intel Cube (alternating unused colors) in the matching city.
4. After all Agents are placed, reshuffle the Agency Cards and deal two to each player (kept hidden).  
5. Reveal six face-up Agency Cards in the Region Spaces around the board. Place the rest as a face-down draw deck.  
6. Shuffle Mission Cards and deal three to each player. Each player chooses two to keep (placed behind screen), returning one to the bottom of the deck. Place the deck face-down; reveal the top three face-up nearby.  
7. Shuffle Code Cards and deal two to each player (kept hidden, Code side up). Split the remainder into two face-down decks (Equipment side up) near the board.  
8. Shuffle Cipher Tokens and place them in two rows of six tiles each.  
9. Place Turn Order Tokens next to the board—one per player—stacked with #1 on top. Return extras to the box.  
10. Place all Special Operations Tokens into the bag; position the bag near the Special Operations folder on the board.

**Determine First Player**:  
All players roll all five dice. The player with the most dice showing the same number goes first. If tied, the player with the highest total pip value wins. If still tied, use the Sean Connery voice rule as a tiebreaker.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds in three phases:
1. **Roll and Place Dice**  
2. **Break Codes**  
3. **Dice Resolution**

The round repeats until a player completes their sixth Mission.

#### Roll and Place Dice
- All players simultaneously roll their dice and place them visibly in front of them (recommended: in numerical order).  
- A **Reroll Token** can be used once per game: discard it to reroll any number of dice.  
- Starting with the player who was last in turn order the previous round (first round: start player), players take turns placing one die at a time.  
- Dice may be placed on:
  - **Action Circles (4)**: Must match the number on the space and be adjacent to an existing die (if any).  
  - **Special Operations Folder**: Any die, any number. Immediately draw one Special Operations Token from the bag and place it behind your screen.  
  - **Decoder Area**: Dice placed here are used in the Break Codes phase.  
- If a player cannot or chooses not to place a die, they take the lowest-numbered available Turn Order Token. This sets their turn order for Break Codes and Dice Resolution. Once a player takes a token, they may no longer place dice this round.  
- When all players have taken a Turn Order Token, proceed to Break Codes.

#### Break Codes
- Players act in turn order (#1 first).  
- Each player attempts to break up to two Code Cards using the following:
  - **One swap**: Exchange positions of two adjacent Cipher Tiles. Adjacent includes:
    - Horizontally or vertically neighboring tiles.
    - End tiles in a row (e.g., leftmost and rightmost of the same row) may be swapped, though not considered adjacent for other purposes.
  - **Use Decoder Dice**: Place dice from the Decoder onto Cipher Tiles to change their number to match the die. Each die can only be used for one code.  
- If a Code Card’s sequence matches three consecutive numbers in order (e.g., 4-5-6), the code is broken.
  - Place the completed Code Card (Equipment side up) to the left of your Character Card.
- Return all dice used on the Decoder to your play area.
- Draw replacement Code Cards (from either deck) to maintain two in hand.

#### Dice Resolution
- Players act in turn order (#1 first).  
- Each player resolves one Action at a time by removing dice from the board. Actions may be delayed—dice do not need to be resolved immediately.  
- Actions depend on where dice were placed:

##### Complete Mission (Action Circle)
- One Mission per die.
- Must fulfill all conditions:
  - **Equipment**: Discard matching Agency Card(s).
  - **City**: Have an Agent in the named city.
  - **Region**: Have an Agent in any city in the shown Region.
  - **Agency Card Icon**: Discard any Agency Card (cannot be substituted with completed Mission/Code symbols).
- Completed Mission Cards are placed face-up under the Character Card (partially tucked), scoring points at game end. Some provide in-game benefits:
  - **Equipment Icon**: Can substitute for discarding an Agency Card in future missions (permanent).
  - **Region Icon**: Counts as having an Agent in that Region for future missions (permanent).
- **Note**: Equipment from completed Missions/Codes cannot fulfill "discard any Agency Card" requirement.

##### Mission Cards (Action Circle)
- Draw one Mission Card per die (face-up or face-down).
- Players may hold up to three Mission Cards. If a fourth is drawn, discard one immediately.
- Drawing one card = one Action.

##### Agency Cards (Action Circle)
- One face-up Agency Card per die.
- Must have an Agent in a city matching the Region of the card being taken.
- Alternatively, spend **two dice** to take **any** face-up or face-down Agency Card.
- Replace drawn face-up cards immediately from the draw deck. Reshuffle discard pile if needed.
- Players may hold up to seven Agency Cards. Excess must be discarded immediately.
- Agency Cards provide:
  - **Equipment**: Discard to fulfill Mission requirements.
  - **City (Flight Tag)**: Discard to move an Agent to that city.
  - **Special Ability**: Discard to activate ability (see below).

##### Movement (Action Circle)
- One movement point per die.
- Move **all** your Agents up to the number of spaces equal to dice resolved in a single Action (e.g., 3 dice = move all Agents up to 3 spaces total).
- When an Agent leaves a city, place one of your Intel Cubes there (only one per player per city allowed).
- Multiple Agents may occupy the same city.

##### Gathering Intel (Triggered by Movement)
- When moving into a city containing **opponent's Intel Cubes**, pick them up and place on your Character Card.
- If you collect **two cubes of the same color**, return both to the owner (or discard in 2-player if not opponent’s) and immediately:
  - Take the face-up Agency Card from the Region matching the city you're in, **or**
  - Draw one random Agency Card from the draw deck.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Special Operations (Tokens and Agency Cards)
- Can be activated **on your turn** during **Roll and Place** or **Dice Resolution**.
- Activation is **in addition** to normal actions.
- No limit on number used per turn.
- Abilities:
  - **+1**: Add one pip to a die (6+1=1).
  - **–1**: Subtract one pip from a die (1–1=6).
  - **Move x3**: Move up to three spaces across one or more Agents.
  - **Espionage**: When any player discards an Agency Card (for any reason), take it into your hand.
  - **Sneak Attack**: Place two dice this turn instead of one.
  - **First**: Resolve one Action before normal turn order, or Break Codes first. If multiple players use it, the one highest in turn order goes first.
  - **Code Breaker**: One extra tile swap during Break Codes.
  - **Search**: Draw top 3 cards from Agency or Mission deck; keep one, return others to bottom.

#### Completed Codes
- Completed Code Cards provide Equipment usable **once** for a Mission.
- If used, discard and shuffle back into Code Card deck.
- If **not used**, worth **2 points** at game end.

#### Turn Order and Round Reset
- After all players have resolved dice and returned them, return all Turn Order Tokens.
- The player who was **last in turn order** this round starts the **next round** by placing the first die.
- Play proceeds clockwise.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game ends** when a player completes their **sixth Mission**.
- Finish the current round.
- Then, each player (in turn order) may attempt to complete **one final Mission**.
  - No dice placement or actions required.
  - May use Agency Cards and Special Operations Tokens (e.g., fly an Agent).
  - **Cannot use Character Abilities**.
- Final scoring:
  - **Points from completed Mission Cards** (values printed on cards).
  - **2 points per completed Code Card still in player’s area** (not used to complete a mission).
- **Winner**: Highest total.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Most completed Mission Cards.
  2. Highest single-value Mission Card completed.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use completed Mission/Code Equipment for "discard any Agency Card" missions?**  
  No. Must discard an actual Agency Card.

- **Can I pick up my own Intel Cubes?**  
  No. Only cubes of other players' colors.

- **Can I move an Agent into a city with my own Intel Cube?**  
  Yes. Only restriction is one cube per player per city.

- **Can I use multiple Special Operations Tokens in one turn?**  
  Yes. No limit.

- **What happens if I break a code but don’t want to complete it?**  
  You must complete it. Broken codes are immediately placed in your area and replaced.

- **Can I use a Special Operation to fly an Agent after moving normally?**  
  Yes. Flying via Agency Card or Special Ops is separate from movement actions.

- **Can I use "First" more than once per turn?**  
  Only if you have multiple tokens or cards with the "First" ability.
