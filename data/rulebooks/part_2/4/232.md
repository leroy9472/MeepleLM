## Serenissima — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Serenissima is a strategic trading and naval warfare board game set in the Mediterranean during the age of maritime republics. Players take on the roles of powerful trading states competing for economic dominance, naval supremacy, and territorial control. The objective is to accumulate the most Victory Points (VPs) by the end of the game through a combination of economic success, port control, fleet strength, and capital retention.

2. Components  
While specific components are not listed in detail, inferred elements include:  
- Game board depicting Mediterranean ports and sea lanes  
- Player galleys (ships)  
- Sailor counters  
- Goods tokens (e.g., Wine, Textiles, Spices, Iron, Wood, Gold)  
- Ducat currency (in denominations of 100, 500)  
- Forts  
- Warehouse markers  
- Dice  
- Turn tracker  
- Player flags for harbor control

3. Setup  
- Number of rounds:  
  - 2 players: 12 rounds  
  - 3 players: 10 rounds  
  - 4 players: 8 rounds  
- Each player receives:  
  - 2 galleys placed at their capital  
  - 10 sailors (distributed freely between galleys and capital)  
  - 2000 ducats (3×500, 5×100)  
- Neutral garrisons: equal to half the warehouse size in neutral harbors  
- Each galley must always have at least 1 sailor or it is lost/sinks  
- Galleys can carry up to 5 total units of goods and/or sailors

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of the following phases in order:  
1. **Advance Turn Marker & Bid for Turn Order**  
   - Players bid ducats for turn order. Ties are broken by die roll.  
2. **Actions Phase (in turn order, but actions may be performed in any order)**  
   - Purchase goods  
   - Build forts (500 ducats + wood + gold)  
   - Build galleys (500 ducats + wood + iron)  
   - Recruit sailors (100 ducats each; max per harbor = number of goods in warehouse)  
   - Reorganize: freely move goods and sailors among galleys and harbors in the same space  
3. **Movement Phase (in turn order)**  
   - Galleys move up to 1 space per sailor on board  
   - If entering a space with opposing galleys:  
     - Must request permission to pass  
     - If denied, movement ends in that space  
     - Cannot move backward  
4. **Combat Phase (in turn order, voluntary)**  
   - Declare attacking galley and target (adjacent port or galley in same space)  
   - Both players roll a die:  
     - Losses = (sailor count + die roll) ÷ 3, rounded down  
     - If attacking a fortified port, divide by 4 instead  
   - Combat is simultaneous  
   - Attacker may choose to continue or end combat after each round  
   - If all sailors on a galley are lost:  
     - Victorious player may sink it or claim it as a prize (by moving 1 sailor aboard)  
     - Goods and sailors may be transferred between victorious and captured galley  
     - Port defender cannot claim defeated galley or its goods  
     - Attacker cannot claim control of a defeated port until the next phase  
5. **Capture Harbors Phase (in turn order)**  
   - Move sailors from adjacent galleys into unoccupied harbor spaces to claim them  
   - Once claimed, harbor remains under player control until captured by another player  
6. **Sales & Income Phase (in turn order)**  
   - Sell goods to ports where the good is **not present or produced**  
   - Sale price = 100 ducats × the lowest-numbered warehouse position available  
   - Bonuses ("New Market"):  
     - +500 ducats if the good is new to any of the opponent’s harbors  
     - +1000 ducats if the good is new to the opponent’s capital  
   - Income:  
     - 300 ducats for retaining control of your capital at end of round

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Trading & Purchasing Goods**:  
  - In own or neutral port: 100 ducats per good  
  - In another player’s port:  
    - Seller names price (100–300 ducats; up to 1000 with monopoly)  
    - Buyer may accept or counteroffer  
    - Seller may accept or refuse  
    - Buyer has final chance to accept original offer  
- **Recruitment Limit**: Max sailors recruited per harbor = number of goods in that harbor’s warehouse  
- **Galley Capacity**: Max 5 units (goods + sailors) per galley  
- **Port Control**: Maintained until captured; no need to garrison continuously  
- **Combat Permissions**: Optional; attacker may stop at any time

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after the final round. Players score Victory Points as follows:  
- 10 points for controlling own capital  
- 10 points for fully developed capital (own and any captured capitals)  
- 5 points per fully developed medium port  
- 2 points per fully developed small port  
- 1 point per non-full port  
- 1 point per 500 ducats  
- 1 point per 2 galleys  
- 1 point per 2 forts  
- 1 point per 10 sailors  

*Note: “Full” port refers to a warehouse that is completely developed (all positions filled).*

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I sell to my own port?**  
  No. Sales to own ports yield no income.  
- **Can I claim a captured galley immediately?**  
  Yes, if you win combat and move at least one sailor onto it.  
- **Can I claim a captured port immediately after defeating defenders?**  
  No. Port capture must occur in the dedicated "Capture Harbors" phase.  
- **What happens if a galley has no sailors?**  
  It is lost/sinks immediately.  
- **Can I move goods between galleys in different spaces?**  
  No. Reorganization is only allowed within the same space.  
- **Do I get income from sales to neutral ports?**  
  Yes, if the good is not present or produced there.  
- **Is combat mandatory when moving through enemy-occupied space?**  
  No. Combat only occurs if initiated; movement conflict is resolved via permission, not automatic combat.
