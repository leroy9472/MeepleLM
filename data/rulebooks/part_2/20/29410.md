### 3. Setup

   - Temple → Priest  
   - Tavern & Praetorium → Soldier  
   - Baths & Emporium → Merchant  
   - Basilica & Forum → Advocate  
3. Place remaining Citizens into the cloth bag.  
4. Place 1 Praefect Favor on each Praefect Favor space (6 total, one per Institution except Temple).  
5. Place the Praefect on the Praefect space at the Basilica.  
6. Randomly draw 1 Citizen from the bag and place it on the Citizen space in each Praefect Meeting Room (6 total).  
7. Each player takes:  
   - 7 Family Members of one color  
   - Matching Family Disc  
   - 3 Family Cards of their color (face-up in front of them)  
8. Shuffle the 12 Common Cards into a face-down draw pile.  
9. Unused components are returned to the box.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Starting with the first player (determined randomly), play proceeds clockwise. On a turn, a player:  
1. **May Move**: Move Family Members using one of the following options:  
   - Move 1 or 2 Family Members each by 1 step to an adjacent Institution  
   - Move 1 Family Member by 2 steps (must follow connected paths)  
2. **Must Play a Card**: Choose one of the following:  
   - Reveal the top card of the Common Deck and resolve it  
   - Play one of their face-up Family Cards  

After resolving all effects, if a card was from the Common Deck, discard it face-up. If it was a Family Card, discard it face-down (used once per game).  
If the Common Deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Citizen Placement Rules  
Citizens can only be placed in specific Institutions based on type:  
- **Priests** → Any Institution  
- **Soldiers (Auxiliaries)** → Tavern or Praetorium  
- **Merchants** → Baths or Emporium  
- **Advocates** → Basilica or Forum  

#### Praefect Event  
Triggered **immediately** when the Praefect moves to a new Institution:  
- Majority Family → gets Praefect Favor  
- Second-most → gets Citizen from Citizen space  
- If only one Family present → gets Praefect Favor; Citizen returned to bag  
- If no Family present → no rewards; Citizen returned to bag  
After event: Refill Praefect Favor space (if emptied) and draw new Citizen for Citizen space.

#### Citizen Event  
Triggered **immediately** when any Institution reaches 3 Citizens:  
- Majority Family → chooses 2 of the 3 Citizens  
- Second-most Family → gets the remaining Citizen  
- If only one Family present → gets 2 Citizens; 3rd returned to bag  
- If no Families present → all 3 Citizens returned to bag  
Event resolves **before** any further Citizens are placed.

#### Power Event  
Occurs when a Power card is played:  
- **All Powers**: Resolve Institution powers in order (Temple → Praetorium); each Institution’s majority player may use its power  
- **One Power**: Each player (starting with active player, clockwise) may use the power of **one** Institution where they have majority  
- **Your Powers**: Active player may use the power in **any or all** Institutions where they have majority  

#### Institution Powers  
- **Temple**: Rearrange Family Disc order by number of Family Members in Temple. Ties retain prior order. This order breaks ties for Power Event activation.  
- **Tavern**: Move one or more Family Members of **one color** from **one Institution** to the Tavern.  
- **Baths**: Move **all your** Family Members from Baths to Temple. Place 1 Wreath on one of them (counts as 2 for influence). Only one Wreath per Family Member.  
- **Emporium**: Draw Citizens from bag one at a time and place in valid Institutions. You may stop at any time, but **must stop** after triggering a Citizen Event.  
- **Basilica**: Either:  
  - Exchange **any 3** Citizens and/or Praefect Favors for **1 Decurion Token**, OR  
  - Draw 1 Citizen from bag and place in front of you  
- **Forum**: Take 1 Citizen from another player **or** from any Institution (not from Praefect Meeting Rooms). Cannot take Praefect Favors.  
- **Praetorium**: Reposition **all** of your Family Members to any Institutions.  

#### Decurion Exchange  
At **any time**, if a player has at least one of each:  
- 1 Priest, 1 Soldier, 1 Merchant, 1 Advocate  
...they **must immediately** exchange them (plus any Praefect Favors) for 1 Decurion Token.  
- Praefect Favors act as **wildcards** and **must be used whenever possible**  
- Exchanged Citizens go back to bag; Praefect Favors returned to supply  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends at the end of any turn where **at least one player has 5 Decurion Tokens**  
- **Winner**: First player to reach 5 Decurion Tokens  
- **Tiebreaker**:  
  1. Most combined remaining Praefect Favors and Citizens  
  2. If still tied, most Praefect Favors  

*(Optional shorter game: play to 4 Decurion Tokens)*

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move through multiple Institutions in one move?**  
  Yes, as long as movement follows connected streets. A 2-step move may go through two connections.  

- **What happens if I can’t place a Citizen due to placement rules?**  
  You must place it in a valid Institution per type. The rules ensure valid options exist (e.g., Priests go anywhere).  

- **Can I trigger multiple Citizen Events with one card?**  
  Yes. Cards like Citizen Visit or Citizen Invitation can trigger multiple Citizen Events, each resolved immediately before continuing.  

- **Can I use a Wreath more than once?**  
  No. Each Family Member may have only one Wreath, and it cannot be transferred or reused.  

- **Do Praefect Favors expire or have limits?**  
  No. They are wilds for Decurion exchanges and remain in front of you until used.  

- **Can I use Basilica to get a Decurion Token without having a full set?**  
  Yes, but only if you exchange exactly 3 Citizens/Favors. It does not require a full set.  

- **Can I play a Family Card even if it has no effect?**  
  No. You must be able to fully resolve the card’s effect to play it.
