## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Battleball is a futuristic football game where two teams compete to score points through touchdowns and tactical dominance. The objective in Battleball Advanced is to accumulate points through Touchdowns, Technicalities (eliminating the opposing team), and Survival Awards (remaining players). The first team to lead by at least 10 points after the second half wins. If not, Overtime Rounds continue until a 10-point lead is achieved.

### 2. Components
- Game board with field and end zones
- Two teams of 11 players each (Iron Wolves and Black Harts)
- Player dice by type:
  - Running Backs: red D20
  - Tackle: yellow D6
  - Heavy Tackle: 2 yellow D6
  - Linebackers: blue D10
  - Safeties: green D12
  - Linemen: black D8
- Brown six-sided Football Passing die
- Football token
- Carnage tokens (mark injured players)
- Locker Room cards (track injured players)
- Player cards (optional, for MVP skills and tracking)

### 3. Setup
1. Choose teams: Iron Wolves or Black Harts.
2. Assemble the board; place the football on the center square.
3. Each coach takes matching dice and places 11 players behind their 20-yard line, facing the opponent.
4. Heavy Tackles occupy 2 squares and must remain parallel to the end zone.
5. No two players may share a square.
6. Half-squares along the edge are valid for movement and placement.
7. Each coach selects a Team Rule and marks it.
8. Roll a red D20; higher roller chooses to go first or second.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Player Activation**: On a team’s turn, the coach may activate up to 3 players, one at a time. Each player completes all actions before the next is activated.
2. **Actions per Player**:
   - Move (mandatory if possible)
   - Optionally: Tackle, Block, Pass, Hand-off, or Field Goal (if eligible)
3. **Turn End Conditions**:
   - A fumble occurs
   - A tackle or block is failed
   - A pass or Field Goal attempt fails
   - The coach chooses to end the turn
4. **Turn Order**: Players alternate activation (Player 1 activates one player, then Player 2, etc.). A coach may reuse the same player across turns.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Movement
- Roll the die matching the player’s base color.
- Move at least 1 square, up to the die result, in any direction.
- Cannot finish on the starting square or on occupied squares.
- Must stop when adjacent to a standing opponent.
- Cannot move through players or carnage tokens.
- May pick up the ball during movement if passing over it.
- **Take Half**: Instead of rolling, move a guaranteed number:
  - Running Back (D20): 10 spaces
  - Linebacker (D10): 5 spaces
  - Tackle (D6): 3 spaces
  - Safety (D12): 6 spaces
  - Lineman (D8): 4 spaces
  - Heavy Tackle (2xD6): 3 spaces
- Cannot Take Half into the opponent’s End Zone.

#### Tackling
- Mandatory if any player is adjacent to an opponent.
- Only one tackle allowed per player action.
- Both players roll their die; **lower roll wins**.
- **Tie**: Both players lose; if one had the ball, it is fumbled.
- **Loser**: Injured, removed from play, Carnage token placed. If roll is 1, player is seriously injured (out permanently).
- **Winner**: Takes possession of the ball (if applicable).
- Heavy Tackles roll both D6 and choose one.

#### Blocking
- Optional alternative to tackling when adjacent to an opponent.
- Cannot block a Down player or a Heavy Tackle.
- Both players roll; **lower roll wins**.
- **Defender loses**: Goes Down, ball fumbled if carrying.
- **Aggressor loses or tie**: No effect.
- Heavy Tackles roll both D6 and choose one.

#### Going Down
- A Down player is laid on their side, remains in place.
- Cannot move or act.
- Does not block movement or trigger tackles.
- Stands up at the end of their team’s next turn.
- May be passed over like a carnage token.

#### Pile-On Attacks
- Occurs when tackling a Down player.
- Attacker rolls the brown passing die:
  - 1: Blocker Down
  - 2–5: Success — Down player is injured (Carnage token placed)
  - 6: Crushing Success — Down player is seriously injured (permanently removed)

#### Passing
- Allowed only if no player is adjacent to an opponent (not in “tackle position”).
- Roll the **receiver’s die** and the **Football Passing die (D6)**.
- **Doubles**: Fumble (receiver fumbles).
- **Sum ≥ Distance**: Pass complete.
- **Sum < Distance**: Pass incomplete.
  - Opponent places ball exactly the number of spaces shown on the Football die from the **intended receiver**, in any direction.
  - If placed on an opponent’s space: **Interception**.
  - If on empty space: **Loose ball**.
  - If no valid space: ball given to nearest player on passing team.
- Only one pass allowed per turn.

#### Hand-Off
- Allowed only if no tackle/block is possible.
- Two adjacent friendly players roll their dice.

- **Doubles**: Fumble.
- Involving a Heavy Tackle: fumble on any double among the dice rolled.
- Ends the activating player’s turn.

#### Field Goal (Optional Variant)
- May be attempted within 50 yards of opponent’s end zone.
- Ball carrier announces attempt; coach rolls player’s die + Football die.
- Modifier: –2 per opposing player within 2 spaces.
- **Sum ≥ distance to end zone**: 3 points scored.
- **Fumble**: Ball placed per fumble rules.
- **Failure**: Opponent gains possession.
- Ends the turn.

#### Picking Up the Ball
- Move onto the ball’s space; place it on your base.
- Continue moving with remaining movement.
- Can be done before, during, or after movement.

#### Fumbles
- Occur when:
  - Doubles are rolled during Tackle, Pass, Hand-off, or Heavy Tackle movement.
  - A successful Block hits a ball carrier.
- Opponent places the ball in any **empty space within 2 of the fumbler**.
- If no empty space: give to nearest player within 2 (own or opponent).
- If no valid space or player: play is halted.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### Scoring (Battleball Advanced)
- **Touchdown**: 10 points (move into opponent’s End Zone with ball)
- **Technicality**: 6 points (eliminate all opposing players)
- **Survival Award**: 1 point per player still on field at half-end

#### Winning
- After 2nd Half: if one team leads by ≥10 points, they win.
- Otherwise, play Overtime Rounds until a team leads by 10.
- Overtime: random team starts; first to lead by 10 wins.

#### Halftime & Reset
- After a Touchdown or Technicality:
  - Clear carnage tokens and injured players.
  - Reset teams behind 20-yard lines.
  - Team that did **not** score goes first in next half.

#### Play Halting
- If no team can reach the end zone:
  - Clear field.
  - Reset teams behind 20-yard lines.
  - Team in possession before halt goes first.
- If both teams down to one player and tied tackle removes both: restart half.
- All players seriously injured: game ends; most touchdowns wins, else tie.
