## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Australia in the 1920s is undergoing rapid industrialization and conservation efforts. Players lead ranger teams tasked with completing projects in both domains. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VP) by completing regional conservation and industrialization projects, strategically placing rangers, and leveraging the windmill mechanic in the advanced game.

2. Components  
- 1 game board (map of Australia with 24 land and water regions)  
- 75 Rangers in 5 colors:  
  - 20 Black  
  - 20 White  
  - 14 Orange  
  - 11 Blue  
  - 10 Brown  
- 5 player airplanes  
- 5 scoring markers  
- 5 player aids (player boards)  
- 42 cards (divided into 4 color-coded decks)  
- 24 Telephone Pole tiles (Industrialization tiles):  
  - 3× value 1  
  - 4× value 2  
  - 5× value 3  
  - 5× value 4  
  - 4× value 5  
  - 3× value 6/7 (each marked with a windmill icon)  
- 24 Koala Crossing tiles (Conservation tiles)  
- 44 Australian dollars (coins)  
- 1 windmill with arrow, ring, and base (for advanced game only)

3. Setup  
1. Place one facedown Telephone Pole tile (Industrialization tile) in each region.  
   - Basic game: Remove all 6 and 7 value tiles before setup.  
2. Place one faceup Koala Crossing tile (Conservation tile) in each region.  
3. Assign player colors and ranger counts based on player count:  
   - 2 players: Black & White – 20 rangers each  
   - 3 players: Black, White, Orange – 14 rangers each  
   - 4 players: Black, White, Orange, Blue – 11 rangers each  
   - 5 players: Black, White, Orange, Blue, Brown – 10 rangers each  
   Each player takes:  
   - 1 airplane (placed in front of them)  
   - 1 scoring marker (placed at 0 on VP track)  
   - 1 player aid (player board)  
4. Sort cards by back design into 4 piles.  
   - Basic game: Take 8 random cards from each pile.  
   - Advanced game: Take 9 random cards from each pile.  
   Place selected cards face down next to the board; return the rest to the box.  
   (Optional variant: place decks face up.)  
5. Starting player is chosen (e.g., youngest player or mutual agreement).  
   Going clockwise, each player draws 2 cards (one at a time, from any pile of their choice).  
6. (Advanced game only): Place the windmill in any region and set its value to 2.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On a turn, a player performs **2 actions**, which may be the same action twice. Actions in any order:

**Action 1: Move Your Plane**  
- Place your airplane in any region.  
- Multiple planes may occupy the same region.  
- If the region contains a facedown Telephone Pole tile, reveal it immediately.  
  - (Advanced game): If the revealed tile shows a windmill icon, increase the windmill value by 1 and move the windmill to that region.

**Action 2: Play a Card**  
- You may play a card only if its color matches the region your plane is in.  
- If you lack a matching card, spend 3 coins to play any card.  
After playing a card, choose **one** of the following:

**2A. Place Rangers and Gain Coins**  
- Place up to the number of rangers shown on the card into **one** camp or ship circle touching the region.  
  - The circle must not contain any opponent’s rangers.  
- Gain coins equal to the coin value on the card.  
- Discard the card (remove from game).  
- Draw a replacement card from any pile.  

  (Advanced game): You may instead (or partially) place rangers on the **Windmill (Ranger) Track**, provided:  
  - Your plane is in the region with the windmill, **or**  
  - Your plane is in a region sharing a **border line** (not just a circle) with the windmill’s region.  
  - In the latter case, you must be legally able to place rangers into a circle along that shared border (even if you choose not to).  
  - Rangers on the track occupy one space each, top-down. No more than one ranger per space.

**2B. Gain 2 VP and Coins**  
- Gain 2 VP.  
- Gain coins equal to the coin value on the card.  
- Discard the card and draw a replacement.

**Action 3: Reclaim Rangers**  
- Take back up to 4 of your rangers from circles touching the region your plane is in.  
- Return them to your supply (player board).

**Once per turn (before or after actions):**  
- Spend 4 coins to move one of your rangers from any circle to another.  
  - Destination must not contain opponent’s rangers.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Region Scoring Triggers:** Each region can score twice:  
  1. **Enclosed Region (Conservation) Scoring**  
     - Triggered when **all circles** touching a region are occupied by rangers.  
     - The player who placed the final ranger(s) gains **3 VP** (triggering bonus).  
     - All players gain:  
       - 1 VP per ranger in **camp** circles touching the region  
       - 2 VP per ranger in **boat** circles touching the region  
     - Remove the Koala Crossing tile (or place on windmill track in advanced game).  

  2. **Quantity Match (Industrialization) Scoring**  
     - Triggered when the **total number of rangers** in circles touching a region **exactly matches** the number on the revealed Telephone Pole tile.  
     - The player who caused the match (via placement or plane landing) gains **3 VP**.  
     - All players gain:  
       - 1 VP per ranger in **camp** circles  
       - 2 VP per ranger in **boat** circles  
     - Remove the Telephone Pole tile (or place on windmill track in advanced game).  

     - If a player reveals a tile and the condition is already met, they are the triggerer.

  3. **Windmill Evaluation Scoring (Advanced Game Only)**  
     - Triggered when **all spaces on the windmill track** are filled with tiles (Koala or Telephone Pole).  
     - Scoring:  
       - 1st place: VP = current windmill value  
       - 2nd place: VP = half of 1st (rounded down)  
       - 3rd place: VP = half of 2nd (rounded down)  
     - Tiebreaker: Player with the highest-placed ranger on the track wins.  
     - After scoring:  
       - Remove all tiles from windmill track.  
       - Return the **top half** of rangers on the track to their owners (rounded down).  
       - Remaining rangers shift up to fill empty spaces, preserving order.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when:  
  - All four card piles are empty **and**  
  - One player plays their final card.  
- Finish the current round so all players have equal turns.  
- Then proceed to endgame scoring:

1. Gain **1 VP per coin** remaining.  
2. Conduct a **final Windmill Evaluation Scoring**, regardless of whether the track is full.

- Highest total VP wins.  
- Tiebreaker: Most coins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Multiple scorings from one action:** A single action (e.g., placing rangers) may trigger multiple region scorings (conservation and/or industrialization). Resolve them in any order.  
- **Plane landing triggers scoring:** If landing your plane reveals a Telephone Pole tile and the number matches current rangers in the region, you trigger the scoring and gain 3 VP.  
- **Missed scoring:** If a player fails to claim a scoring, another player may trigger it on their turn if the condition still holds. That player becomes the triggerer.  
- **Ranger movement with coins:** Costs 4 coins. Can move any of your rangers to any unoccupied or self-occupied circle. Can be done once per turn, outside of actions.  
- **Card play without placement:** If you cannot or choose not to place rangers, you may instead gain 2 VP and coins (Option 2B), provided card color matches region or you pay 3 coins to override.  
- **Windmill movement:** Only occurs when a windmill-marked Telephone Pole is revealed. Value increases by 1, and windmill is physically moved to that region.  
- **Windmill track filling:** Each tile (from any scoring) is placed on the windmill track after its respective scoring. When track fills, immediate evaluation occurs.
