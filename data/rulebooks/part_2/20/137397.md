3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Place bonus tokens on their designated spaces for road segments A, B, and C.  
3. Stack victory point tokens (6-3-1) next to each city. In a 2-player game, use only 6 and 1.  
4. Place stones and tiles in their storage areas on the board.  
5. Place push +1 tokens, city markers, sesterces, and 50+ markers within reach.  
6. Shuffle income cards: Reveal 7 face-up; rest form a draw pile.  
7. Load the quarry: 4 large, 8 mid-sized, and 12 small stones, placed randomly.  
8. Determine starting player and give them the start player token.  
Each player takes:  
- 1 player piece (place in Rome)  
- 1 screen (set up in front)  
- 1 scoring marker (place on space 1 of scoring track)  
- 1 transport cart (place next to screen)  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. On a turn, a player chooses one of four actions:  

**A. Income**  
- Choose one face-up income card.  
- Receive shown sesterces or stones (stones go in front of screen; sesterces behind).  
- Flip chosen card face down.  
- When 3 or fewer face-up cards remain, the player who takes a card receives both sesterces and stones shown.  
- The player taking the *last* card receives a “push +1” token (if they don’t already have one).  
- After last card is taken, refill with 7 new cards from draw pile; shuffle used cards into a new draw pile.  
- If a required stone is unavailable, all players return half (rounded down) of their stones of that size; then the player receives their stone(s).  

**B. Quarry** *(Rule Variant Adjusted)*  
- Push **2 stones** into the quarry, one after the other.  
- If fewer than 2 stones available, player cannot take this action until acquiring more via Income.  
- Place stone behind quarry (behind red dotted line), then use pusher to push it in. Pusher must not cross the line between the two bars.  
- For each stone that falls out the other side:  
  - Exchange for a tile of same size or smaller, or  
  - Sell for 1 sesterce.  
- Tiles must be loaded onto cart, matching cart spaces exactly (e.g., one large, or one mid + one small; not two smalls in large space).  
- If 2 stones are pushed but none fall out, player still receives **1 small tile or 1 sesterce**.  
- If player owns a “push +1” token, they may push a **third stone** (but must still meet 2-stone minimum normally).  
- Return used stones to storage.  

**C. Road Construction**  
- Add **1 or 2 tiles** to the Via Appia.  
- May build in any road segment adjacent to a city the player has visited.  
- Tiles must be placed on spaces connected by a line to an existing tile or to a city behind it.  
- Second tile placement rules:  
  - May place second tile in the **same segment** only if **all previous road segments are complete**.  
  - Otherwise, second tile must go in an **earlier uncompleted segment**.  
- For each tile placed, player receives:  
  - Victory points: Large = 5, Mid = 3, Small = 1  
  - One bonus token of that segment’s color  
- Record victory points immediately on scoring track.  
- If two tiles are built, gain **1 bonus sesterce**.  
- If player exceeds 50 VP, place “50+” marker in front.  

**D. Travel**  
- Move player piece 1, 2, or 3 tiles forward, costing:  
  - 1 tile = 1 sesterce  
  - 2 tiles = 3 sesterces  
  - 3 tiles = 6 sesterces  
- Movement allowed only on tiles (no empty spaces).  
- Must follow connecting lines between tiles.  
- Occupancy rules:  
  - Small or mid-sized tile: 1 player only  
  - Large tile: up to 2 players  
- Movement must stop upon reaching a city:  
  - Take the topmost victory point token from that city  
  - Place a city marker on the city marker space (skip if last player to arrive)  
- City markers reduce travel cost in that segment:  
  - Each marker reduces cost by 1 sesterce for all players who haven’t reached the city yet  
  - Example: 1 marker in Benvenutum → 1 tile move = free, 2 tiles = 2 sesterces, 3 tiles = 5 sesterces  
- Cannot earn sesterces from travel; only pay.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Quarry & Tile Acquisition**: Stones pushed into quarry may yield tiles or sesterces. Variant increases stone usage (2 minimum).  
- **Tile Placement**: Must be adjacent to existing structure; second tile placement restricted by road segment completion.  
- **Travel & City Visits**: Unlock construction zones and earn VP; place city markers that reduce future travel costs.  
- **Income Cycle**: Cards refresh after depletion; scarcity triggers stone returns.  
- **Push +1 Token**: Allows third stone push; only one per player; awarded when taking last income card.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends at the end of the round when:  
- A player collects a victory point token in Brundisium, **or**  
- The Via Appia is fully constructed.  
All players complete the round (equal turns).  

Final Scoring:  
- **Wealth Bonus**: Player with most sesterces gains **2 VP**. Tied? All tied players gain 2 VP.  
- **Construction Dominance (per road segment A, B, C):**  
  - Most tiles built: **8 VP**  
  - Second most: **4 VP**  
- Tie Rules:  
  - Tie for most: Share 8 + 4 = 12 VP equally (e.g., 2 players → 6 VP each)  
  - Tie for second: Share 4 VP equally, rounded down  
- Highest total VP wins. Tie? Shared victory.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place two tiles in segment B if A is incomplete?**  
  No. Second tile must go in an earlier uncompleted segment unless all prior segments are complete.  
- **What if I have only 1 stone but want to Quarry?**  
  Cannot take Quarry action (variant requires 2 stones). Must gain more via Income.  
- **Can I sell a stone that fell from the quarry for sesterces instead of taking a tile?**  
  Yes. Player choice.  
- **Do I get a bonus token for selling a stone?**  
  No. Bonus tokens only for tiles placed during Road Construction.  
- **Can I move past a city?**  
  No. Must stop upon reaching a city.  
- **Can I place a tile not adjacent to anything?**  
  No. Must connect to existing tile or city.  
- **What happens when income cards run out and need refilling?**  
  Reveal 7 new cards from draw pile; shuffle used cards to form new pile.  
- **Can I have more than one “push +1” token?**  
  No. Max one per player.
