## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
After the Flood is set in ancient Sumer (2500–1100 BC), a cradle of early civilization. Players represent evolving powers managing economy, trade, city-building, and military conquest. The game spans 5 turns (each representing ~350 years), with players scoring Victory Points (VP) through territorial control, city expansion, and end-game worker dominance. The player with the most VP after Turn 5 wins. Tiebreaker: turn order.

3. Setup

   - 2 workers  
   - 1 each of Wood, Metal, Tools, Oil, Gold  
4. Place turn marker on 1st space of Turn Track.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has 6 phases:

**Phase 1: Collect Resources and Workers**  
a. **Grain**: Awarded based on workers in Irrigation box (ranked 1st/2nd/3rd via chart).  
b. **Textile**: Awarded based on workers in Weaving box (ranked 1st/2nd/3rd via chart). Ur: gain 1 extra Textile.  
c. Each player takes up to 8 workers from unavailable supply into personal supply. (In Turn 1, players have 10 total workers.)

**Phase 2: Decline (Turns 2 and 4 only)**  
1. Remove all workers from Dilmun.  
2. Each player removes 1 worker from each non-Sumer area.  
3. For Irrigation and Weaving boxes separately:  
   - Player(s) with most workers keep only 2; others remove same number (or as many as possible).  
4. Each player removes 1 worker from Scribes and 1 from Tool Makers boxes.

**Phase 3: Player Actions**  
In order of play, players take turns choosing one action until all pass. Actions may be repeated.  
a. **Build City**: Place city in any Sumer area without opponent's army.  
   - Eridu: immediately place 1 worker from supply into Tool Makers box.  
   - Uruk: immediately place 1 worker from supply into Scribes box.  
b. **Place Workers**: Discard 1 resource; place up to that resource’s value in workers to a single non-Sumer area or IWST box.  
   - Scribes box: max 2 workers per player.  
   - Scribes ability: move a worker to "Used" side to place/replace 1 worker anywhere.  
c. **Trade**: Use all workers (or armies) in non-Sumer areas that allow trade.  
   - Trades are 1-for-1; each resource type can only be traded once per action.  
   - Output from one region can fund input to another in same action.  
   - If any army is in the area, only armies may trade (workers are blocked).  
   - Tool Makers: move worker to "Used" side to exchange 1 Metal → 1 Tools.  
   - Sippar: grants 1 extra trade action in any area (even if already traded there).  
d. **Start Empire**: Must have ≥ as many workers in starting area as any other player (except Sumer Empire).  
   - Take base armies (per chart).  
   - Trade: 1 Grain = 1 army, 1 Metal = 2 armies, 1 Tools = 3 armies (max 20 total).  
   - Assign 0+ resource value to Army Equipment box (determines combat rank A/B/C).  
   - Remove all your workers from the area.  
   - Place 1 or 2 armies in the area.  
   - If opponent army present, fight immediately (see Combat).  
   - Babylon: gain +2 bonus armies.  
e. **Expand Empire**: Choose one:  
   1. **Invade**: Adjacent area; if empty, place 1 army; else fight.  
   2. **Destroy City**: Discard 2 armies to remove opponent's city.  
      - Shuruppak: if controlling it and have >1 city, cost = 3 armies.  
   3. **Reinforce**: Add 1 army to any occupied area (max 2 per area).  
   4. **Repeat**: Discard 1 army to take another sub-action. May repeat multiple times.  
f. **Pass**: Place disc in Passed box; assign 0+ resource value. No further actions this turn.  
   - After first pass, all non-passed players must pay 1 resource/worker/army to take any action (except Pass).  
   - Cost remains 1 even after second pass.

**Phase 4: Order of Play**  
New turn order based on total value of resources in Passed boxes (highest to lowest).  
Ties: maintain relative order from previous turn.

**Phase 5: Victory Points**  
a. **Armies**: 2 VP per controlled area. Nippur: +1 VP per Sumer area controlled.  
b. **Expansion**: Discard 2 Wood + up to 1 each of Tools, Oil, Gold, Lapis. Score VP based on number of luxury goods discarded. Place expansion piece on unexpanded city. Multiple cities may be expanded per turn.

**Phase 6: End of Turn**  
a. Remove all armies and unused workers from board to unavailable supply.  
b. Remove all resources and markers from Passed and Army Equipment boxes. Players keep remaining resources.  
c. Advance turn marker one space.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Combat**: Single die roll (2d6).  
  - Attacker ranked higher (A > B > C): eliminate on 5+.  
  - Attacker ranked lower: eliminate on 7+.  
  - Defender removes army on success; attacker removes one army on failure.  
  - Continue until all enemy armies eliminated, attacker stops, or attacker out of armies.  
  - Invasion is one sub-action of 3e; may continue as long as armies remain.  
- **Worker Placement**:  
  - Max 2 workers in Scribes box per player.  
  - Scribes ability: each worker moved to "Used" side allows 1 worker to be placed/moved anywhere.  
  - Workers in Scribes/Tool Makers must be moved to "Used" side to activate ability.  
  - Worker placed in Scribes box cannot be used that turn.  
- **Trade**:  
  - Armies block worker trade; armies may trade instead.  
  - One trade per resource type per region per action.  
  - Output can fund input in same action.  
- **City Building**:  
  - Max one city per Sumer area.  
  - If all cities built, may move a city (return expansion piece to supply).  
  - Cities may be built in areas with own army.  
- **Empire Start**:  
  - Sumer Empire: may start in any Sumer area.  
  - Must meet worker threshold; fight if opponent army present.  
- **Expansion**:  
  - "Repeat" costs 1 army; allows another sub-action.  
  - Dilmun cannot be invaded (no adjacent arrows).

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after Phase 6 of Turn 5.  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - Each non-Sumer area with VP value: player with most workers scores VP. Ties = 0.  
- **Total VP**: Army control + Expansion + Final area control.  
- **Winner**: Highest total VP. Tiebreaker: turn order (earlier player wins).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I use Scribes ability in same action as placing the worker? No. Worker placed in Scribes cannot be used that turn.

- Can I pass with no resources? Yes; value = 0, but still sets order if others haven’t passed.  
- Can I use output from trade immediately? Yes, within same Trade action.  
- Can I invade Dilmun? No. No arrows connect to it.  
- Can I have more than 2 armies in an area? No. Max 2 per area.  
- Do I lose resources when workers are removed in Decline? No. Only workers are removed.
