## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Goldland*, players explore an uncharted canyon landscape in search of riches. The path is treacherous, filled with adventures like bandits, pumas, and deserts. Success depends not on luck, but on smart use of equipment and strategic movement. The heavier your backpack, the less you can move—forcing tough choices.

**Objective**: Be the player with the most gold at the end of the game. Gold is earned through:
- Gold pieces (1 point each)
- Treasures (3 points each)
- Amulets (3 points each)
- Adventure markers (2–5 points each)

The game ends when all players have an amulet or the temple reserve gold is exhausted.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Backpack
- 12 spaces; each holds 1 item: equipment, treasure, or amulet.
- Movement = highest **uncovered number**.
- When adding items, fill from highest number down.
- When discarding, remove from any space.

#### Treasure
- Placed on tiles with treasure fields when tile is revealed.
- To claim: end your turn on the tile and discard **2 provisions**.
- Treasure goes into backpack (1 per space).
- Worth 3 gold at end.

#### Camps & Adventure Markers
- Each adventure type has a marker (value 2–5).
- First player to survive an adventure type takes its marker.
- If another player later has **more camps** on that adventure type, they take the marker.
- Marker stays with player until overtaken.

#### Amulet & Temple Bonuses
- First player to **end movement** on the goal tile:
  - Takes 1 amulet and 2 gold from **bonus field**.
- All other players who reach the goal tile **before the first player's next turn** also get 1 amulet and 2 gold.
- When the first player starts their next turn, **remaining bonus gold is returned to box**.
- Later arrivals get **only amulet**.
- **Each turn**, players with an amulet take **1 gold** from **reserve field** at the **start of their turn**.
- If reserve is empty, take from box.
- Only **1 amulet per player**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

**Final scoring**:

**Highest total wins**.
