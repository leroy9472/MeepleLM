## CRUDE: THE OIL GAME — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Crude: The Oil Game simulates the high-stakes world of oil industry management. Players act as CEOs of oil corporations, overseeing operations from drilling and refining to selling gasoline. The goal is to be the first to accumulate $750 million in cash and successfully declare victory after all other players have had one final turn.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Economy Game Board  
- 1 Operations Game Board  
- 8 News Cards (shuffled into a face-down deck)  
- 7 Economy Cards (face-up stack; "Recovery" on top at start)  
- Money Tokens (denominations unspecified; $200M start)  
- 2 Production Dice (red and black)  
- 1 Difference Die (green)  
- 80 Drilling Rigs (plastic)  
- 16 Oil Wells (plastic)  
- 12 Oil Refineries (plastic)  
- 30 Gas Stations (plastic)  
- 80 Crude Oil Barrels (black)  
- 80 Gasoline Barrels (red)  
- 1 Rulebook  

*Note:* No hard limits on components; use substitutes (e.g., coins) if supply runs out.

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player selects a quadrant on the Operations Board.  
2. Distribute starting cash:  
   - 4 players: $200M each  
   - 3 players: $250M each  
   - 2 players: $300M each (controls two opposite quadrants)  
3. Each player receives:  
   - 2 Crude Oil Barrels  
   - 2 Gasoline Barrels  
   Place these in their quadrant’s storage.  
4. Place 1 Gasoline Barrel on the $26 space of the Consumer Market.  
5. On Domestic and Foreign Markets:  
   - Place 1 Gasoline Barrel on each $8–$14 space (leaving $2, $4, $6 uncovered)  
   - Place 1 Crude Oil Barrel on each $3–$5 space (leaving $1, $2 uncovered)  
6. General Supply: All remaining Assets and Barrels placed nearby.  
7. News Deck: Shuffle 8 News Cards, place face-down. Draw 2 face-up:  
   - Left: "Most Likely News Event" (closest to deck)  
   - Right: "Unlikely News Event" (furthest)  
8. Economy Deck: Place 7 Economy Cards face-up, "Recovery" on top.  
9. Place green Difference Die on "0" of Dice Difference Track.  
10. Determine Starting Player:  
   - Most recent person to fill their car with gas, OR  
   - Highest die roll.  
   Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn consists of 5 phases in strict order:  
1. Market Phase  
2. Production Roll Phase  
3. Neighbor Phase  
4. Assets Phase  
5. End of Turn and Victory Declaration Phase  

After a player declares victory, all others get one final turn before final scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### 1. Market Phase  
- Player may **buy or sell** Crude Oil or Gasoline in **one market only** (Domestic **or** Foreign).  
- **Buying**: Pay price under lowest uncovered barrel; remove barrel to stock.  
  - Example: Buy 2 Gasoline at $6 and $8 → Pay $14  
- **Selling**: Place barrel on highest uncovered price; collect amount.  
  - Example: Sell to $12 and $10 → Collect $22  
- May not buy and sell across both markets.

#### 2. Production Roll Phase  
- Roll red and black dice. These determine row and column on player's quadrant.  
- **Check for Doubles**:  
  - Double-1s or Double-3s: Trigger "Most Likely News Event"  
  - Double-6s: Trigger "Unlikely News Event"  
  - Other doubles (2s, 4s, 5s): No news event, but may end active ones  
- Resolve News Event immediately: read aloud, apply effect.  
- After event:  
  - Draw new card to "Unlikely" spot  
  - Slide "Unlikely" → "Most Likely"  
- **Dice Difference Track**:  
  - Calculate difference between dice (e.g., 2 and 5 → difference = 3)  
  - Move green die up by that amount  
  - If green die reaches or exceeds **8**:  
    1. Roll green die  
    2. Match roll to current Economy Card’s table → new Economy Card  
    3. Remove all but one Gasoline Barrel from Consumer Market  
    4. Move remaining barrel up/down red spaces per "Change in Consumer Demand" on new card  
       - Positive: move up  
       - Negative: move down  
       - Zero: no movement  
    - *Note:* Do not count current red space as first space when moving.

#### Assets Produce (after dice roll)  
Only assets in rolled row or column are "Hit". If both dice line up on same asset, it is "Double Hit". Resolve in any order.  

- **Refinery**:  
  - Hit: Convert 1 Crude Oil → 1 Gasoline (from General Supply)  
  - Double Hit: Convert up to 2  
  - Optional; cannot use oil collected this turn  

- **Drilling Rig**:  
  - Single Hit: No effect  
  - Double Hit: May convert to Oil Well for $5M more than previous Oil Well built  
    - First Oil Well: $5M  
    - Second: $10M  
    - Third: $15M, etc.  
  - Optional conversion  

- **Oil Well**:  
  - Hit: Collect 2 Crude Oil  
  - Double Hit: Collect 4  
  - Cannot collect from well built this turn  

- **Gas Station**:  
  - Hit: Sell 1 Gasoline to Consumer Market at next lowest uncovered price  
    - E.g., last sold at $25 → sell at $24, collect $24M  
  - Double Hit: Sell 2 Gasoline  
  - Multiple stations: each hit sells one (or two on double hit)

#### 3. Neighbor Phase  
- Left neighbor uses die corresponding to their row (e.g., if red die = 3, left neighbor checks row 3)  
- Right neighbor uses die corresponding to their column  
- Each may resolve hits normally  
- **No double hits possible** (only one die applies)  
- Player across from current player does nothing  
- Ghost player (in 3-player game): Rolls dice, neighbors may benefit, but takes no other actions

#### 4. Assets Phase  
- Buy Assets from Bank at **Purchase Price** on current Economy Card  
- Place immediately on quadrant (Drilling Rigs: 1 square; Refineries: exactly 4 squares)  
- Sell Assets back to Bank at **Liquidation Value** on current Economy Card  
  - **Restriction**: Can only sell Assets that were **Hit** during Production Roll  
- Strategic timing is critical, especially near endgame

#### 5. End of Turn and Victory Declaration Phase  
- After all phases, player may:  
  - **Declare victory** if cash ≥ $750M  
  - Or **pass** to next player  
- Player is never forced to declare  
- If victory declared:  
  - All other players get **one final turn**  
  - Then proceed to End of Game

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- After final turns:  
  - All players sell remaining Assets at **Depression Card Liquidation Value**  
  - Any Crude Oil or Gasoline in stock is **worthless** (but may break ties)  
- Total cash determines winner  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with most total barrels (Crude + Gasoline) wins  
  - Quantity only; value ignored

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I refine oil collected this turn?**  
  No. Cannot use Crude Oil collected during same turn for refining.  
- **Can I sell un-hit Assets?**  
  No. Only Assets that were Hit this turn can be sold.  
- **What happens if General Supply runs out?**  
  Use substitutes (e.g., coins) until components return.  
- **Can I buy barrels in Special Purchase Round?**  
  No. Only Assets (not barrels) may be bought.  
- **Do News Events stack?**  
  Only one active at a time unless card specifies otherwise.  
- **Can I place Refinery across quadrants?**  
  No. Must be fully within one player’s quadrant.  
- **In 2-player game, can I share oil between quadrants?**  
  No. Each quadrant operates independently; assets and barrels are not shared.
