## PRAETOR — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   In the year 122 CE, Caesar Hadrian commissions the construction of Hadrian’s Wall and a supporting city in Roman Britain. Players are rival engineers competing to earn the most Favor Points (FP) through city development, resource management, and fulfilling Caesar’s demands. The player with the most FP at game end becomes Praetor and wins.

2. **Components**  
   - 42 City Tiles (divided into Age I and Age II)  
   - 14 Wall Tiles (Caesar’s demands)  
   - 5 Player Boards (A/B sides)  
   - 1 Common Board (Favor Points track, Turn Order track)  
   - 8 Workers and 15 Markers in 5 colors (per player)  
   - Resources: 112 Gold, 25 Wood, 25 Stone, 20 Marble, 20 Weapons  
   - 4 Summary Sheets  
   - Rulebooks, Player Aids, and Variant Rules

3. **Setup**  
   - **City Tiles**: Use only tiles marked for player count (e.g., 2+ for 2 players). Shuffle Age II tiles, place on bottom; shuffle Age I, place on top.  
   - **Starting City**: Place all "0" tiles face-up in center per player count layout (2–5 players).  
   - **Available City Tiles**: Reveal (number of players + 1) from the top of the stack.  
   - **Wall Tiles**: Shuffle into face-down stack; reveal one.  
   - **Player Setup**:  
     - Choose Player Board side (A for beginners, B for experts).  
     - Take all Workers and Markers of one color.  
     - Start with: 3 Active Workers (1, 2, 3 experience), 10 Gold, 4 Wood, 3 Stone, 2 Marble, 1 Weapon.  
     - Place Morale Marker at 0.  
     - Place one Marker on nearest Gold Mine.  
     - Assign Favor Track positions: one player on 10, others on 9, 8, 7, etc., counterclockwise.  
   - Place Common Board and resources within reach.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   Each turn proceeds in three phases:  
   - **I. Turn Order Phase**: Order players from least to most Favor Points. In case of tie, top marker on stack goes first.  
   - **II. Action Phase**: In turn order, players take actions or pass. Actions:  
     1. **Build City Tile**: Use Active Worker to build from Available City Tiles. Pay cost, place adjacent to existing tile, gain FP (printed + matching corners).  
     2. **Activate City Tile**: Use Active Worker on built tile. Pay owner activation cost (if not self-owned). Gain benefit.  
     3. **Activate Special Tile (gray)**: No Worker needed. Pay cost to owner, perform action. One use per player per turn.  
     - Players may pass at any time. Once passed, no further actions.  
   - **III. Update Phase**:  
     a. **Workers**:  
       - Move Novices right. If on second level → Active Worker (same experience).  
       - If control “Academy”, skip second training level. Others may pay 1 Stone to owner to skip.  
       - Return Retired Workers used via Labor Camp.  
       - Return Active Workers:  
         - +1 experience if used to build or activate red-area tile.  
       - Retire Workers with 6 experience: gain 12 FP (Age I) or 8 FP (Age II).  
       - Pay wages: cost per Active and Retired Worker (on board).  
         - Per missing Gold: -1 Morale.  
         - If at Morale minimum: pay 5 FP per missing Gold.  
       - If no Active Workers: spend 5 FP to recruit Villager (1 experience).  
     b. **City (skip on last turn)**:  
       - Refill Available City Tiles to (players + 1).  
       - Replace current Wall Tile with new one.  
       - Check end game: if City Tiles or Wall Tiles stack empty → next turn is final.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Workers = Dice**: Experience = face value. Retire at 6.  
   - **City Tile Activation**:  
     - Each tile activated once per turn (except Labor Camp).  
     - Labor Camp: Each player may use once per turn to activate one Retired Worker (counts as 6-experience Active Worker).  
   - **Corner Matching (Plaza)**: When building, gain 1 FP per matching corner design with adjacent tile.  
   - **Special Tiles**:  
     - **Labor Camp**: Pay 1 Weapon to owner to use Retired Worker.  
     - **Academy**: Pay 1 Stone to skip second training level.  
     - **Imperial Outpost**: Choose Wall Tile, pay cost, gain printed FP + bonus FP from prior fulfilled Wall Tiles.  
   - **Resource Management**:  
     - Market: Trade freely per board rates.  
     - Limited Market (Variant): Worker experience limits number of trades.  
   - **Unassigned Labor Camp (Variant)**: First player decides placement. Any player may pay to use. No owner.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - **End Game Trigger**: After Update Phase, if City Tiles stack or Wall Tiles stack is empty → next turn is final.  
   - **Final Scoring**:  
     - **Workers**:  
       - Active Workers: 1 FP per experience.  
       - Novice Workers: 1 FP each.  
     - **Morale**: Score FP value at current track position.  
     - **Resources**: Convert all to Gold via Market rates. 1 FP per 10 Gold.  
   - **Victory**: Most FP wins. Tiebreakers:  
     1. Highest Morale  
     2. Most Wall Tiles controlled  
     3. Most City Tiles controlled  
     - Still tied? Youngest player wins.  
   - **Expert Variant Scoring (3–5 players)**:  
     - Largest contiguous city area: 12/8/4/0 FP  
     - Most Wall Tiles: 18/12/6/0 FP  
     - Most Villagers: 20/10/5/0 FP  
     - Ties: average FP, rounded down.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Temple Limits**: Temple of Plutus and Temple of Mercury max FP gain per activation is 22.  
   - **Labor Camp Use**: Each player may use each Labor Camp once per turn. With 2 in city, max 2 Retired Workers reactivated per player.  
   - **Tie in Turn Order**: Stacked markers; top goes first.  
   - **No Workers**: May spend 5 FP to activate Villager if no Active Workers.  
   - **Wall Tile Bonuses**: Each fulfilled Wall Tile grants increasing bonus on subsequent ones.  
   - **Short Game Variant**: Remove 5 random Wall Tiles before setup (hidden from players).  
   - **Tough Game Variant**: Remove all Market tiles → no trading.
