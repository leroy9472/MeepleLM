## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The game revolves around strategic control of locations, characters, and resources in a post-apocalyptic world defined by factions, terrain, and special events. Players assume roles navigating challenges such as imprisonment, combat, alliances, and exploration. The overarching goal is to gain advantage through card draws, character acquisition, and tactical positioning, ultimately achieving dominance by completing objectives tied to locations and events.

Victory conditions are not explicitly defined but appear to involve accumulating power via new characters, card advantages, and controlling key zones. Winning duels, surviving encounters, and successfully navigating scenarios contribute to long-term success.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- No formal scoring system is provided.
- Victory appears to be achieved through:
  - Gaining new characters
  - Drawing large numbers of cards (especially Vault cards)
  - Controlling key locations
  - Eliminating or banishing opponents
  - Winning three duels in Field of Honor (grants new character)

End game likely occurs when a player fulfills a hidden or scenario-based objective (e.g., collect X Vault cards, defeat Y enemies, survive Z events).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: What does “ungroup” mean in the tuck-box file?**  
A: Likely refers to graphic design software — ungroup elements in the template to edit individual images or resize components.

**Q: How tall are the keys?**  
A: Keys are listed as 74cm x 86cm — this is likely a typo. More plausible: 74mm x 86mm (standard card size). 7 keys stacked = ½ inch high → ~7mm per key.

**Q: What is “Θ” in SQ + Θ?**  
A: Unknown symbol. Possibly denotes a required action, item, or condition (e.g., token, quest completion). Assumed necessary to activate effect.

**Q: When is Tower of Ages usable?**  
A: Only when position reaches “Goodwill” — likely a track advanced via Lith Alliance.

**Q: Can you combine effects from multiple locations?**  
A: Yes, unless restricted. For example, winning Royal Tournament and Ruins of Cany XII both grant new characters and Vault cards.

**Q: What happens when HQ is destroyed?**  
A: AZ effect specifies HQ destroyed — likely removes its function from play.

**Q: What is “The Deal” in Mercenary Camp?**  
A: Unclear. Implies a one-time opportunity; only one team can succeed.
