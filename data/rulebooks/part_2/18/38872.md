## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Jet Set is a strategic board game of airline empire building, where players expand their networks across a global map by claiming air routes, operating flights, building hotels, and capitalizing on income streams. The goal is to maximize your point total through efficient route planning, smart investments, and timely use of special actions and expansions.

The game ends when a player places their fifth plane on their Final Flight card. Players then score points from completed routes, hotels, hubs, income markers, and other achievements. The player with the highest score wins.
