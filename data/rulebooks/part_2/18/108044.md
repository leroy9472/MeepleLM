## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are a mad scientist with a secret laboratory, unmatched intellect, and a dream of world domination. You're not alone — other geniuses seek the same power. Use your spies (Minions), devious inventions, and cunning predictions of opponents’ actions to build wealth, outmaneuver rivals, and be the first to achieve 20 or more Victory Points (VP) — and more than any other player — to win the game.

**Objective**: At the end of any round, be the only player with 20+ VP. If multiple players tie at 20+ VP, play continues until one leads.

### 2. Components  
- **6 Lair playmats** (1 per player color): Each has a Phase Guide, 4 Investment Areas (Speculate, Invent, Research, Work), and a Vault.
- **30 Wooden Minions** (5 per player in 6 colors).
- **24 Action cards** (4 per player color): Speculate, Invent, Research, Work.
- **64 Invention cards**: Cards with costs, effects, and VP values.
- **36 Twist cards**: Rule-modifying cards; 2 used per game.
- **90 Bags of Money**: Denominations of $1 (54), $5 (24), $10 (12). Supply is shared.

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player takes:
   - 1 Lair playmat.
   - 5 Minions (in matching color) — place in reserve.
   - 4 Action cards (in matching color).
   - $10 in Bags of Money — place in Vault on Lair.
2. Shuffle Invention deck. Deal **3 Invention cards face down** to each player (private hand). Place the rest as a draw pile. Leave space for a discard pile (face-up).
3. Draw **2 Twist cards** randomly; place face-up in the center. These alter game rules.
4. Put unused Twist cards back in the box.
5. All money and number of Invention cards in hand are public. Invention card identities are private.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow (Round Structure)  
Each round has 4 phases:

#### I) Select and Reveal Action Cards  
- All players **simultaneously** choose 1 Action card and place it face-down above their Lair.
- All reveal simultaneously. Cards stay face-up.

#### II) Collect Income from Investments  
- For **each Minion** a player has in an Investment Area:
  - Gain **$1** for each **adjacent player** who played the **matching Action** this round.
- **Adjacent** = players directly to left and right.
- **In 2-player games**: opponent counts as both neighbors → **double income**.
- **You do not gain income from your own Action**.
- Example: You have 2 Minions in Invent. Left neighbor played Invent → gain $2.

#### III) Resolve Actions (in numerical order)  
Actions resolve in this fixed order:
1. **Speculate**
2. **Invent**
3. **Research**
4. **Work**

All players who took the same Action resolve it **simultaneously**.

##### Speculate  
- Pay cost to place 1 Minion from reserve to an Investment Area:
  - **Speculate**: $0
  - **Research / Work**: $1 each
  - **Invent**: $2
- You **cannot move** existing Minions. Only place from reserve.
- Cannot Speculate if you can’t afford the cost or have no Minions left.

##### Invent  
- Choose 1 Invention card from hand. Place it **face-down** above your Lair.
- All players who chose Invent **reveal simultaneously**.
- Pay the **cost** (top-left corner) to the bank.
  - If you **can’t pay**, return the card to your hand. Nothing else happens.
- **Resolve effects**:
  1. Each player resolves **their own Invention’s effects on themselves first**.
  2. Then, each player resolves **others’ Invention effects that affect them**, in **clockwise order from their left**.
- Effects occur **once**, when played. After resolution, Invention is moved **below Lair** to show VP.
- If multiple Inventions affect you, order matters: your own first, then clockwise.

##### Research  
- Draw **1 Invention card** from the deck.
- Gain **$2** from the bank.
- If deck is empty: shuffle discard pile into new deck, then draw. If still no cards, no draw.

##### Work  
- Gain **$4** from the bank.

#### IV) Check for Winner / Retrieve Action Cards  
- **Total Victory Points** = sum of VP values (lower-left corner) of all Inventions you've built.
  - Some Twists or Inventions may modify scoring.
- If **one player has ≥20 VP and more than all others**, they win.
- If **tied at ≥20 VP**, game continues.
- Otherwise, all players retrieve their Action cards and start a new round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Invention Card Effects  
- Effects are in the box on the lower-right.
- **Green downward arrow (↓)**: affects **only you**.
- **Red multi-arrow (▽)**: affects **all other players**.
- Effects resolve **top to bottom** on the card.

**Effect Symbols**:
- 🚤+: Draw 1 Invention card.
- 🚤−: Discard 1 Invention card (you choose).
- 🙪+: Gain $X.
- 🙪−: Lose $X (minimum $0).
- 🚥+: Place 1 Minion from reserve to any Investment Area **for free**.
- 🚥−: Remove 1 Minion from your board to reserve (you choose).

**Slash Effects (/)**:
- **/ 🚤**: per Invention card **in your hand**.
- **/ 🚥**: per Minion **on your board**.
- **/ G**: per Invention **you’ve built** (including current one).

**Special Invention Cards**:
- **Brain Swapper**: Draw 1 card per Invention built (including this), then discard same number.
- **Delicious By-products**: Gain $1 per Invention built (including this).
- **Moon Base**: Gain $3 per card in hand, then discard entire hand.
- **Robot Doubles**: Place 1 Minion per Invention built (including this).
- **Secret Lair**: Worth 1 VP per Invention built (including itself). Value increases with later Inventions.
- **X-Ray Specs**: Gain $1 per card in hand.

#### Partial Resolution  
If you can’t fully resolve an effect, do as much as possible:
- Must discard 2 cards, have 1 → discard 1.
- Must place a Minion, but all 5 are on board → do nothing.
- Must lose $3, have $2 → lose $2.

#### Drawing Cards  
- If draw pile is empty during a draw:
  - Shuffle discard pile to form new deck.
  - If still not enough cards for all who need to draw → **no one draws**. No more draws for the game.

#### Public vs. Private Info  
- **Public**: Money, number of Invention cards in hand, Inventions built.
- **Private**: Identities of cards in hand.

#### Twist Cards  
- 2 Twist cards are active per game.
- They can modify setup, actions, effects, scoring, or win conditions.
- If both Twists trigger at the same time, resolve in **order revealed**.
- Examples:
  - **Parallel Universe**: Double all Action effects (e.g., Invent = build 2 Inventions).
  - **Hyperinflation**: Lose all money when playing an Invention (even $0 cost).
  - **Bigger and Better**: Gain $2 if you’re the sole player to Invent this round.
  - **Animal Rights Activists**: Research gives card but **no $2**.
  - **Long-term Plans**: Commit to an Invention face-down; must play it next Invent.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory Points (VP)** = total from lower-left corners of built Inventions.
  - Some Inventions (e.g., Secret Lair) scale with other Inventions.
  - Twists may alter scoring.
- **End Game Trigger**: After any round, if **one player has ≥20 VP and strictly more than all others**, they win.
- **Tie at 20+ VP**: Game continues. Winner is first to break the tie.
- **No maximum round limit**.
