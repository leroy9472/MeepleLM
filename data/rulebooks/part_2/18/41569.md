### 1. Lore & Objective
In September 1666, a fire began in Pudding Lane due to a careless baker, rapidly consuming much of London. Players take on the roles of wealthy landowners who must manage the disaster by directing fire-fighting efforts, demolishing buildings to create firebreaks, or allowing the fire to destroy rivals' properties. Victory is achieved by maximizing Victory Points (VPs), earned through saving houses, extinguishing fires, completing secret objectives, and acquiring special tokens.

### 3. Setup
1. **Board Setup**: Place 25 fire cones in Pudding Lane. Shuffle Fire Move Cards and deal 5 to each player. Replace any hand with 5 identical cards.
2. **Fire Stack Deck**: For 3 players use Cards A–F; 4 players: A–D; 5 players: A–E; 6 players: A–F. Begin with Card A face-up, deal face-down cards as indicated, place Card B on top, and repeat.
3. **Houses**: Place 5 houses of each colour into a bag. Randomly draw and place houses in the Orange region’s districts according to house symbols. Repeat for the other three regions (Purple, Blue, Green), adding 5 houses of each colour per region.
4. **Player Assignment**: Shuffle Player Colour Cards and deal one to each player (face down for Hidden Colours; face up for Open Colours). Each player takes 2 matching pawns: one to mark their colour card, one as their landowner pawn.
5. **Tokens**: Shuffle 20 black tokens (Demolition, Double Move, +1 VP) face down and place one on each yellow-labeled district.
6. **Objective Cards**: Shuffle decks I, II, and III separately. Deal one card from each deck to every player.
7. **Trained Bands**:  
   - 3 Players: Each player places 2 cones in turns (2 rounds).  
   - 4 Players: Place 1 cone in Hounds Ditch and 1 in St. Bottolphs; then each player places 1 cone.  
   - 5 Players: Place 1 cone in Cripplegate; then each player places 1 cone.  
   - 6 Players: Each player places 1 cone.  
   All cones must be placed outside the green region.
8. **Landowner Pawns**: In player order, each places their landowner pawn in any district outside the green region.
9. **Hero of London**: Place the Hero of London Card near the board.
10. **Start Player**: Determine by who most recently visited London or randomly.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each player turn consists of three phases:
1. **Expand the Fire**
   - Play a Fire Move Card from hand.
   - Select a fire cone from a district with at least 2 cones.
   - Move the cone through connected burning districts.
   - Final move into a non-burning district must follow the card’s direction.
   - Movement priority applies:
     1. District with houses and no trained bands.
     2. District with houses and trained bands.
     3. Empty district with no trained bands.
     4. Empty district with trained bands.
   - If a trained band is present and not containing fire, place it on the incoming fire cone (containing the fire).
   - If no trained band is available to contain the fire:
     - Remove all houses and place them on the scoring track (each house lost = −2 VP).
     - Add fire cones to match the original number of houses in the district.
     - Claim any token in the district.
   - **Double Move Token**: May be used to move a second fire cone this turn (same card direction).
   - If Pudding Lane has fewer than 1 fire cone, add 5 from stock. If stock is empty, each player returns 1 cone to stock.
   - If no legal move is possible: reveal hand, discard 1 card, then "Intensify the Fire".

2. **Take Actions (4 action points)**
   - **Move Landowner Pawn**: 1 point per adjacent district. Cannot enter Pudding Lane. May move through demolished or burning districts.
   - **Move Trained Band**: 1 point per adjacent district. Cannot enter Pudding Lane. If entering a district with uncontained fire, must stop and contain it. Cannot move if already containing fire.
   - **Put Out a Fire**: Costs 1 action point. Requires:
     - Fire is contained (trained bands ≥ fire cones).
     - Landowner pawn is in the district.
     - Removes 1 fire cone; player keeps it (1 VP each at end).
     - First player to collect 3 fire cones gets Hero of London Card. If another player exceeds that count, they take the card.
   - **Demolish a District (Free Action)**:
     - Must have a Demolition Charge token.
     - Trained band must be present.
     - District must be adjacent to a district with fire.
     - District must have no fire (contained or not).
     - Cannot demolish a district with 3+ houses unless already burnt.
     - Place demolition token face-up in district (creates firebreak).
     - Remove all houses to scoring track (−2 VP each).
     - Remove any token (destroyed, not collected).

3. **Draw a Fire Card**
   - Draw to restore hand to 5 cards.
   - If a Fire Stack Card is revealed, "Intensify the Fire":
     - Add 3 fire cones to any districts with uncontained fire (not Pudding Lane).
     - Maximum cones per district = original houses + 2.
     - If unable to place all 3, place what is possible and discard the rest.
     - Discard the Fire Stack Card after resolution.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Fire Spread**: Directed by cards and movement priority; cannot spread into grassed areas.
- **Containment**: Trained bands can contain fire (1 band per cone). Contained fires cannot spread.
- **Action Economy**: 4 action points per turn for movement and fire suppression.
- **Demolition**: Free action using collected tokens; creates permanent firebreaks.
- **Token Use**: Single-use and limited per turn (max 1 per phase).
- **Hand Management**: Maintain 5 cards; Fire Stack Cards trigger "Intensify" events.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End**: Triggered when the last Fire Stack Card is resolved. Each player takes one final turn (or two if "More Destruction" variant is used).
- **Final Scoring**:
  - **Surviving Houses**: 2 VP per house not burnt or demolished (track starts at 40 VP; each lost house covers 2 VP).
  - **Extinguished Fires**: 1 VP per fire cone removed and kept.
  - **Objective Cards**: Reveal and score VPs for each district that survived (must still have houses; uncontained fire or empty = not survived).
  - **VP Tokens**: 1 VP per +1 VP token owned.
  - **Hero of London**: 2 VP for the current holder.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Most fire cones (extinguished).
  2. Most intact houses on the board.
  3. Highest objective card score.
  4. Draw if still tied.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **No Fire Move Possible**: Reveal hand, discard 1 card, then Intensify the Fire.
- **Pudding Lane Empty**: Add 5 fire cones from stock. If stock empty, each player contributes 1 cone.
- **Hero of London Transfer**: Automatically transfers when another player extinguishes more fires.
- **Demolition of Empty Districts**: Allowed if adjacent to fire and trained band present.
- **Token in Demolished District**: Destroyed; player does not gain it.
- **Double Move Token**: Can be collected and used in the same turn.
