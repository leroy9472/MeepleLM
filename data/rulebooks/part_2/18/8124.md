## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Industria*, players take on the roles of industrial magnates guiding their dynasties through five eras of technological advancement—from the clay pit to the robot factory. The goal is to build a powerful industrial empire by acquiring and constructing factories, technologies, and infrastructure. Victory is achieved through strategic bidding, efficient resource management, and maximizing endgame scoring via connections, bonus tiles, and assets.

### 2. Components  
- 60 Industry Cards (12 per era), divided into:
  - Factories
  - Technologies
  - Raw Materials
  - Bonus Tiles (Canal, Port, Tracks, Pipeline, Data Network)
- Game Board featuring:
  - Factory and Technology placement areas
  - Era track with Epoch Circles (I to V)
  - Score track
- 4 sets of colored Property Markers (20 per player)
- 4 colored Point Markers
- 30 Wooden Disks (Money): Grey = 1 Taler (Dollar), Yellow = 5 Talers
- 2 Large Wooden Disks:
  - Starting Player Marker
  - Epoch Marker

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player chooses a color and receives:
   - 4 Talers (Dollars)
   - A set of property markers
   - A point marker, placed on "0" of the score track
2. Place the Epoch Marker on the first epoch circle (I) of the board.
3. Sort Industry Cards by back (Roman numerals I–V). For 3 players, remove stack V.
4. Shuffle each stack separately and place face-down beside the board.
5. Randomly select the starting player, who takes the Starting Player Marker.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in 5 phases:

#### Phase 1: Distribution of Earnings  
Each player receives 1 Taler from the bank.

#### Phase 2: Reveal Tiles  
Draw 1 tile per player from the current epoch’s stack and place them face-up near the board.

#### Phase 3: Auctioning Tiles  
- The current Auctioneer (initially the Start Player) selects one revealed tile for auction.
- Bidding proceeds clockwise starting with the player to the left of the Auctioneer.
- Each player may bid once or pass. Bids must exceed previous bids.
- After all players have acted:
  - The Auctioneer may:
    - Sell to the highest bidder (collect money), then choose another tile to auction.
    - Take the tile for free, ending their auctioneer role. The player to their left becomes the new Auctioneer.
  - If no one bids, the Auctioneer must take the tile for free and cede the auctioneer role.
- The Start Player Marker **does not move** during this phase.
- Repeat until all revealed tiles are auctioned.

#### Phase 4: Building  
Starting with the Start Player, each player may build up to 3 tiles from their hand, with restrictions:
- Maximum of 1 tile per type per turn:
  - 1 Factory
  - 1 Technology
  - 1 Bonus Tile
- Resource tiles are consumed when used and removed from the game.

**Building Requirements:**
- Pay printed construction cost (in Talers) to the bank.
- Provide required raw materials using one of four methods:
  1. Play a raw material card from hand (discarded after use).
  2. Own a factory that produces the needed resource (automatic).
  3. Buy from another player who owns a producing factory for 1 Taler (cannot refuse).
  4. Buy from the bank for 1 Taler, **if**:
     - No player produces it, **and**
     - It has appeared in a prior epoch.

**Special Factories:**
- **Bank** and **Stock Exchange**: Each reduces all building costs by 1 Taler. Effects are cumulative (both = -2).
- These factories may be built in any epoch but only score points if built in the correct one.

**Scoring During Build:**
- **Factories**: Score printed VP only if built in the **same epoch** they were auctioned.
- **Technologies**: May **only** be built in the epoch they were auctioned; score printed VP immediately.
- **Bonus Tiles**: No immediate points; scored at game end.

#### Phase 5: Change of Start Player  
- Pass the Start Player Marker to the left.
- If any tiles remain in the current epoch, begin a new round (repeat Phases 1–5).
- If all tiles in the epoch are auctioned:
  - Move the Epoch Marker to the next circle.
  - **Prior epoch’s raw materials** become available at the bank (see table below).
  - Discard all unplayed Technology tiles from players’ hands.
  - If entering Epoch III, IV, or V: each player receives **1 additional Taler** (on top of Phase 1 income).

**Raw Material Availability Table:**
| Epoch | Available Raw Materials |
|-------|--------------------------|
| I     | None                     |
| II    | Stone, Brick, Wood       |
| III   | Iron, Ceramic, Glass + all previous |
| IV    | Electricity, Cement, Steel + all previous |
| V     | Plastic, Computers + all previous |

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Auction Dynamics**: The Auctioneer controls flow—can keep auctioning if selling, or pass control if taking a tile.
- **Resource Economy**: Strategic interdependence via player-produced resources; bank acts as backup for older-era materials.
- **Timing & Epoch Constraints**:
  - Technologies are time-sensitive: must be built in auctioned epoch or discarded.
  - Factories are flexible but lose scoring potential if delayed.
- **Cost Reduction**: Bank and Stock Exchange provide permanent -1 each to building costs.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Trigger:**
- Ends after final player completes Phase 4 in **Epoch V** (for 4 players) or **Epoch IV** (for 3 players), once all tiles are auctioned.

**Final Scoring:**
- **Bonus Tiles**: 2 points for each factory owned with a matching symbol. Multiple matches allowed (e.g., two matching symbols on one factory = 4 points if both bonus tiles are owned).
- **Connections**: 3 points per **connection** between two owned factories or technologies linked by a street/line on the board.
- **Money**: 1 point per 3 Talers (round down).
- **Unplayed cards**: No points.

**Winning:**
- Highest total score wins.
- Tiebreakers:
  1. Most cards played (Factories + Technologies + Bonus Tiles)
  2. Most money (if still tied)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a player buy more than one tile per round?**  
  Yes. A player can win multiple auctions in one round.

- **Can I use a factory built this round to supply resources?**  
  Yes. Newly built factories immediately produce their resource.

- **Can I sell raw materials?**  
  Yes. At any time, a player may discard a raw material card to gain 1 Taler.

- **Can I use Bank/Stock Exchange to reduce cost below 0?**  
  No. Construction cost cannot go below 0. No money is refunded.

- **What happens to raw materials when an era ends?**  
  They remain usable. Only technologies are discarded.

- **Can I play a technology in a later round of the same epoch?**  
  Yes, as long as it's within the same epoch it was auctioned.

- **Do connections stack?**  
  Yes. Each distinct connection scores 3 points. A factory connected to two others counts as two connections.
