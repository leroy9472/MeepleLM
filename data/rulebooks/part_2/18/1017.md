## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Each player aims to build the shortest possible network of streets connecting supply centers to their corresponding retail outlets. The game simulates urban development under constraints, where players must strategically reserve plots, manage auctions for key buildings, and respond to forced infrastructure (expropriation). The player with the lowest total score wins.

2. Components  
- Grid of plots (size depends on player count)  
- Tiles:  
  - Supply centers: Harbor, Nuclear Power Plant, Oil Refinery, Game Factory  
  - Retail outlets: Fish Market, Nuclear Waste Disposal, Gas Station, Game Shop  
  - APO tiles: Apartment, Park, Office (functionally identical)  
  - Optional: Construction Zone, Antinuclear Demonstration  
  - Streets (placed during expropriation)  
- Markers: 8 colored cubes per player (6 kept in supply, 2 set aside)  
- Money: Green = 5, Orange = 1  
- Deck: Shuffled tiles based on player count  

3. Setup  
- **Grid size**:  
  - 2 players: 7×7  
  - 3 players: 8×8  
  - 4 players: 9×9  
  - 5 players: 10×10  
  - Mark borders with unused face-down retail outlet tiles.

- **Supply center placement**:  
  - Harbor: Place in one corner.  
  - Other three (Nuclear Power Plant, Oil Refinery, Game Factory):  
    - Simple: Place in remaining corners  
    - Moderate: Place in different quarters  
    - Complex: Anywhere on board  

- **Tile deck composition**:  
  - Retail outlets: 1 of each type per player (4 types → 4×player count)  
    - Unused types removed from game  
  - APO tiles: 8/12/15/19 for 2/3/4/5 players  
  - Optional:  
    - 1–2 Construction Zone tiles + same number of extra APOs  
    - 1–2 Antinuclear Demonstration tiles  
  - Remaining APOs set aside for later use when deck is empty.

- **Player setup**:  
  - Each player receives 15 money (suggested: 1 green, 10 orange)  
  - Each player gets 8 markers: keep 6, set 2 aside  
  - Choose starting player (suggested: last to have eaten fresh fish)  
  - Agree on auction tiebreaker rule (see Auctions)

4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds clockwise. On each turn, a player must:  
1. Reserve a plot **or**  
2. Draw a tile **or**  
3. Pass (only if neither of the above is possible)  

A player may draw a tile **only if** they have at least one reserved plot.

Turn options:  
- **Reserve a Plot**  
- **Draw a Tile**  
- **Pass**

5. Core Mechanics  

**Reserving a Plot**  
- Place one of your markers on an unreserved, empty plot.  
- First reservation: Any empty plot allowed.  
- Subsequent reservations: Must be orthogonally adjacent to any tile or any player’s marker.  
- A plot with a marker but no tile is **empty**; only plots with tiles are **developed**.

**Drawing a Tile**  
- Draw from the main deck.  
- If deck is empty: Choose any set-aside APO tile or a street tile.

**Tile Placement by Type**  

- **APO or Street Tile**:  
  - Place on one of your reserved plots.  
  - Return your marker to your supply.  
  - Trigger Expropriation if needed.

- **Retail Outlet Tile**:  
  - Initiate auction among eligible players.  
  - Only players **without** that outlet type may bid.  
  - Bidding:  
    - All bidders place bids face-down in hand.  
    - Reveal simultaneously.  
    - Highest bid wins.  
    - Tiebreakers (choose one before game):  
      - **Author’s Rule**: Winner is first clockwise from current player (including current).  
      - **Translation Error Rule**: Winner is first counterclockwise from current player, then clockwise (current player last).  
  - Winner:  
    - Pays bank  
    - Places tile under their marker on one of their reserved plots  
    - Marker remains on tile  
    - If no reserved plots, keeps tile off-board (scored as maximum length)  
    - If this is their 1st or 2nd retail outlet placed, move one set-aside marker to supply  
  - After placement, trigger Expropriation.

- **Antinuclear Demonstration**:  
  - Place on one of your reserved plots  
  - Return marker to supply  
  - Counts as a **street tile** for connectivity  
  - Scores as **3** on route (not 1)

- **Construction Zone**:  
  - Place on top of an existing APO tile  
  - If no APO exists, set aside; place on next APO built  
  - Any player may build an APO on a Construction Zone **without reserving the plot first**  
  - Does not require ownership or reservation

**Expropriation**  
- Triggered after every tile placement (if needed)  
- Purpose: Ensure all supply centers, retail outlets, empty plots, and streets remain connected via street network  
- Rule:  
  - Any empty plot whose development would **disconnect** any part of the network must be expropriated  
  - A street tile is placed on each such plot  
  - If a player’s marker is on an expropriated plot, return it to their supply  
- Expropriation is **automatic and immediate**  
- One placement can trigger multiple expropriations  
- APO tiles do **not** need to be connected

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when:  
  - All plots are developed, **or**  
  - Players agree scores are effectively determined  

- **Scoring**:  
  For each player, score 4 routes:  
  - From each supply center to its matching retail outlet:  
    - Harbor → Fish Market  
    - Nuclear Power Plant → Nuclear Waste Disposal  
    - Oil Refinery → Gas Station  
    - Game Factory → Game Shop  
  - Route length:  
    - Each street tile = 1  
    - Each Antinuclear Demonstration = 3  
    - Route must use at least one street  
    - Adjacent supply and outlet → score **1**, not 0  
  - Maximum per route:  
    - 2 players: 8  
    - 3 players: 10  
    - 4 players: 12  
    - 5 players: 14  
  - Total: Sum of all 4 route scores  
  - Subtract player’s remaining money  
  - Final score may be negative  

- **Winning**:  
  - Lowest total score wins  
  - Tiebreaker: Most money  
  - Further tie: Arm wrestling (humorous note in rules)

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I draw a tile with no reserved plots?**  
  No. Must have at least one reserved plot to draw.

- **What if I win an auction but have no reserved plots?**  
  Keep the retail outlet off the board. It scores maximum route length.

- **Can I build on a Construction Zone without reserving?**  
  Yes. Any player may place an APO on a Construction Zone tile without having reserved that plot.

- **Do APO tiles need to be connected?**  
  No. Only supply centers, retail outlets, streets, and empty plots must remain connectable.

- **Can expropriation happen during setup?**  
  No. Only after tile placements during play.

- **What if all bidders are ineligible for a retail outlet?**  
  Only possible if one player lacks it. That player wins with 0 bid.

- **Can a player have more than one of the same retail outlet?**  
  No. Each player may have only one of each type. Thus, only players **without** that outlet may bid.

- **What happens to unused retail outlets?**  
  Removed from the game during setup.

- **Can I reserve a plot adjacent to someone else’s marker only?**  
  Yes. Adjacency to any player’s marker or any tile is sufficient.
