## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The objective of Design Town (also known as Flip City) is to be the first player to achieve victory by either accumulating 8 Victory Points (VPs) in a single turn or fulfilling an alternate win condition (e.g., playing a Convenience Store and at least 18 cards in one turn). Players simulate urban development by playing and upgrading double-sided building cards to grow their town efficiently while managing risk.

2. Components  
- Double-sided cards of 5 types:  
  - Residential Area / Apartment  
  - Convenience Store / Shopping Mall  
  - Hospital / Church  
  - Factory / Power Plant  
  - Central Park / Station  
- All cards feature:  
  - Cost (coin symbol, top-right corner)  
  - Flip fee (purple arrow, bottom-right corner)  
  - Some cards have a recycle symbol (green arrow, bottom-right) indicating they can be recycled from the discard pile  
  - Some provide Victory Points ( ), cash ( ), or unhappiness ( )

3. Setup  
- Each player receives:  
  - 4 Residential Area  
  - 1 Apartment  
  - 1 Convenience Store  
  - 1 Hospital  
  - 1 Factory  
  - 1 Central Park  
- Shuffle these to form a personal deck. Shuffle discreetly (e.g., under the table) to prevent card counting.  
- General supply (placed in center of table, coin side up):  
  - 12 Convenience Stores  
  - 12 Hospitals  
  - 8 Factories  
  - 8 Central Parks  
  - (Optional: 10 Offices)  
- Randomly choose a starting player.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in counter-clockwise order. Each turn has two phases:

A. Play Cards Phase  
1. Play cards one at a time from the top of your deck.  
2. After playing each card, decide whether to:  
   - Play another card, or  
   - Stop and proceed to Building Phase.  
3. You may look at the top card of your deck before deciding.  
4. If your deck runs out:  
   - Choose to stop, or  
   - Shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck and continue.  
5. If 3 or more cards are revealed during this phase, you "bust":  
   - Your turn ends immediately.  
   - Played cards are placed in your discard pile.  
   - No building action is taken.  
6. Recycle ability:  
   - Cards with a green arrow ( ) in the bottom-right can be recycled.  
   - At any time during your Play Cards phase, flip a recyclable card in your discard pile to gain its temporary benefit.  
   - The card remains in the discard pile after use.  
   - Multiple recycles allowed per turn.  
7. Mandatory play:  
   - If the top card of your deck is a Residential Area, you must play it when it is revealed.  
   - If you bust and the next top card is Residential Area, leave it in place (do not play).

B. Building Phase (only if you did not bust)  
Using cash earned during the Play Cards phase, choose exactly one of the following actions (unless granted extra actions by cards):

a) Buy  
- Select a card from the general supply.  
- Pay its cost (shown in coin symbol, top-right).  
- Place the card face-up in your discard pile.

b) Flip  
- Select a card in your discard pile.  
- Pay its flip fee (next to purple arrow).  
- Flip it to its reverse side.  
- It remains in the discard pile.

c) Buy & Upgrade (Develop)  
- Select a card from the general supply.  
- Pay both its cost and flip fee.  
- Place it directly into your discard pile with the back side up.

After completing your action, check for victory.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Deck Management: Your deck cycles through play and discard. Reshuffling is common.  
- Risk vs. Reward: Playing more cards increases potential cash and VPs but risks drawing 3 or more , which ends your turn.  
- Recycling: Enables reuse of powerful effects from discard pile without reshuffling.  
- Card Flipping: Upgrading cards unlocks better versions (e.g., Hospital → Church).  
- Cash and benefits are reset each turn; nothing carries over.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Immediate win conditions (checked at end of Building Phase):  
  - Gain 8 or more Victory Points in a single Play Cards phase.  
  - Play a Convenience Store and at least 18 other cards in one turn.  
- If a player meets either condition, they win immediately.  
- If a player busts (3+ ), their turn ends without building or winning check.  
- Game ends as soon as a player wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I look at my discard pile?  
  A: Yes, at any time.

- Q: What if I reach the limit and a win condition simultaneously?  
  A: The limit takes precedence. If you reveal a third , your turn ends immediately, even if you had already reached 8 VPs or played 18+ cards.

- Q: What if the general supply is empty?  
  A: You cannot buy or develop cards. You may still flip cards from your discard pile.

- Q: How does Hospital scoring work?  
  A: Each Hospital gives increasing cash based on how many have been played before it in the same turn. First Hospital = $2, second = $3, etc.

- Q: How does recycling work?  
  A: Recyclable cards (with green arrow) can be flipped in the discard pile during your Play Cards phase to gain their effect. No cost. Can be done multiple times. Card stays in discard.

- Q: What happens when I shuffle my deck mid-turn?  
  A: After shuffling the discard pile into a new deck, you may choose to play another card or stop.

- Q: What if a card is dropped or orientation is unclear?  
  A: Shuffle it back into the deck with the front side up.
