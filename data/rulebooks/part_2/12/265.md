## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Intrige, players take on the roles of noble families vying for influence and wealth at a Renaissance court. Each player controls a Palazzo and a set of relatives seeking employment in others’ Palazzos. The goal is to maximize personal wealth through strategic placement of relatives in high-paying jobs, leveraging bribery, negotiation, and manipulation. The game centers around economic competition, player-driven conflict resolution, and tactical decision-making. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.

2. Components  
• 5 Palazzo sets (red, green, yellow, purple, blue) — each set contains 4 cards forming a complete image. Each card has a job position with a salary: $1,000, $3,000, $6,000, or $10,000.  
• 5 sets of 8 relative tiles (2 per profession: scribe, minister, alchemist, healer) in each Palazzo color.  
• 1 island — central location where banished relatives are placed.  
• Money bundle — $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 denomination bills.

3. Setup  
• Each player receives:  
  - 4 Palazzo cards of one color (assembled in a row to form a full image).  
  - 8 relative tiles of matching color.  
  - $32,000 in cash (2 bills of each denomination: $1k, $5k, $10k → total: 2×$1k + 2×$5k + 2×$10k = $32,000).  
• The island is placed in the center of the table.  
• One player is chosen as banker (manages money supply).  
• Starting player is selected (typically the oldest player).  
• Each player arranges their Palazzo cards in a row. The top section of each card holds employed relatives; the bottom section (park) holds job applicants.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds clockwise and lasts 6 rounds. Each turn consists of three mandatory actions in order:  

(1) Collect Income  
- Receive salary for each of your relatives currently employed in other players’ Palazzos.  
- Salaries are paid by the bank based on the value of the position held ($1k, $3k, $6k, or $10k).  

(2) Assign Jobs  
- Resolve job applicants waiting in your park (from other players’ relatives sent during their "Seek Employment" phase).  
- Each of your 4 Palazzo positions may employ only one relative.  
- Assignment rules depend on conflict type:  

  A. No Conflict: If all applicants are of different professions and number matches open jobs → all must be hired. You assign positions freely.  

  B. External Conflict: Two or more applicants of the same profession are in the park (but none currently employed in your Palazzo).  
     - Bribes are collected in clockwise order starting from the first player with an applicant.  
     - Minimum bribe: $1,000.  
     - After all bribes are paid, you choose which one of the conflicting applicants gets a job.  
     - Others are banished to the island.  

  C. Internal Conflict: One of your current employees is of the same profession as one or more applicants in the park.  
     - The current employee’s owner may pay a bribe to defend the position.  
     - Then, each attacker (applicant’s owner) pays a bribe in clockwise order.  
     - You decide whether the defender keeps the job or the highest bribe attacker takes it.  
     - Loser(s) are banished to the island.  
     - Resolve internal conflicts in order of salary: lowest first ($1k → $3k → $6k → $10k).  

(3) Seek Employment  
- You must send exactly two of your unemployed relatives to seek jobs in other players’ parks.  
- They must go to two different parks.  
- You cannot send relatives to your own park.  
- Relatives may be of the same or different professions.  
- No restrictions beyond these; stacking multiple relatives in one opponent’s park is allowed.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Bribery: Central mechanic. Players offer bribes to influence job placement. Bribes are paid directly to the Palazzo owner and kept permanently.  
- Conflict Resolution:  
  - Profession duplication is prohibited within a single Palazzo (including park + employed).  
  - External conflict: multiple applicants of same profession in park (no current employee).  
  - Internal conflict: current employee vs. applicant(s) of same profession.  
- Turn Order: Fixed clockwise order. Starting player rotates? Not specified — assumed fixed.  
- Banishment: Losing relatives in conflicts are removed to the island for the rest of the game.  
- Job Assignment Power: The Palazzo owner has full discretion in assigning jobs after bribes are paid, regardless of bribe amounts.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game lasts 6 rounds.  
- After the 6th round, players perform one final income collection.  
- No further job assignments or employment actions occur.  
- The player with the most total money wins.  
- In case of a tie, no tiebreaker is specified.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
Q: Can a player send two relatives of the same profession to the same park?  
A: Yes. There is no restriction on sending multiple relatives of the same profession to a park.

Q: What happens if a Palazzo has open jobs but fewer applicants than openings?  
A: Only applicants present are considered. Unfilled jobs generate no income and remain vacant until next round (if applicants appear).

Q: Can a bribe be $0?  
A: No. Minimum bribe is $1,000.

Q: Are bribes refundable?  
A: By default, no — bribes are lost even if the relative loses.  
  Exception: In the "Banished relatives recover bribes" variant, losing players get their bribe money back.

Q: Can promises be enforced?  
A: Only under the "Binding Promises" variant: promises about actions within the current turn are enforceable if both parties fulfill their parts. Future promises are not binding.

Q: What if a player runs out of money?  
A: Not specified. Assume players can go into debt if necessary, unless house rules forbid it.

Q: Can a relative be rehired after being banished?  
A: No. Once banished to the island, a relative is out for the rest of the game.
