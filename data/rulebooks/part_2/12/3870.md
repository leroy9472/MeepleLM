## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
7 Ages is a grand strategy civilization board game where players guide empires across history, from ancient times to the future. The objective is to earn the most Glory points by advancing on the progress track, adopting governments and religions, building cities, winning trades, and achieving other milestones. The game ends when an empire reaches progress level 50 or through special end-game triggers in variants. Victory is determined by highest Glory; ties are broken by most advanced empire.

2. Components  
- Empire cards  
- Action cards (including events, artifacts, leaders)  
- Player counters (units, leaders, forts, capitals, disorder markers)  
- Progress and money markers  
- Standard 52-card deck + 1 joker (for variant)  
- Combat Resolution Table (CRT)  
- Terrain and city value reference

3. Setup  
- Each player draws 7 cards; highest card plays first (re-draw ties).  
- Players simultaneously spend cards to claim permanent empire pairs (light/dark).  
- Initial empires are placed following card-specific rules and progress offsets based on most advanced empire in play.  
- Units, leaders, capitals, and forts are placed per empire card instructions.  
- Progress and money markers are set accordingly.  
- For 6+ players: max 2 empires/actions per player.  
- Optional: Use Redemption rule for initial deal (per house rules).

5. Core Mechanics  

a. **Start Empire**  
- Play empire card, choose color (own permanent if available).  
- Place progress marker (never below current game age).  
- Spend startup money to buy units, place leader(s), capital, and forts.  
- Convert existing forces if in starting area.  
- Resolve conflict if enemy present.  
- If no empires, may draw randomly until legal empire is found.  

b. **Production**  
- Income = sum of terrain values + city levels (fertile wheat only Ages 5–7; oil only Age 7).  
- Half income if no capital.  
- Pay 1 gold per unit for maintenance (barbarians exempt).  
- Unmaintained units are disbanded. If no units remain, lose area; if others remain, area becomes disordered.  
- Build units: max 1 per area, or up to city level if city present.  
- Naval units: build on coastal land or sea (not ocean).  
- Forts: 5 gold each (barbarians cannot build).  

c. **Trade & Progress**  
- Trade with empire in range or deck.  
- Range = your empire’s age in steps (cannot cross ocean before Age 4; cannot cross other empires’ land unless permitted or paid).  
- Simultaneously reveal trade card; add trade power.  
- Winner gains 1 progress. Bonus: +1 if chose Trade action, +1 if trading with more advanced empire.  
- Tie: empire that chose Trade gains +1.  
- May give gold to partner.  

d. **Maneuver**  
- Spend movement points (explorers give +1).  
- Leaders must accompany units.  
- Ships move on sea; may carry 1 land/air unit.  
- Enemy units pin 2 of your units (air units not pinned by land/sea).  
- Cannot vacate land areas unless only aircraft remain.  
- Remove disorder: need units ≥ 1 + terrain defense + city value (archer/missile units only).  
- Battles:  
  - Commit units secretly.  
  - Strength = card value + frontline value (½ units) + support value (rest) + elite marker (max +3) + age advantage + best frontline/support per opponent + [defender: terrain, fort (+2), city (if attacker has non-archer missile)].  
  - Elephant cancels frontline value of chariot, light horse, horse archer. If elephant lost, must retreat.  
  - Round loser loses all committed units; tie = both lose.  
  - Repeat with uncommitted units.  
  - If no uncommitted and must use tired troops, +1 disorder.  
  - May retreat if opponent has disorder.  
  - Battle loser loses 1 elite marker (if any).  
  - Defender loses artifacts, forts, and city level.  
  - If capital or leader lost (and no capital), loser loses all money (½ to winner).  

e. **Destiny**  
- Discard any number of cards.  
- Draw back up to 6 cards.  

f. **Civilize**  
- Play events, artifacts, assassinate, promote/demote leaders.  
- Adopt religion/government (must meet prerequisites).  
- Modernize units (flip to backside).  
- Urbanize: improve two cities (+1 if builder).  
- Remove disorder: 7 gold each.  

g. **Discard Empire**  
- Discard empire card.  
- Remove all markers (leaders, units, forts, artifacts).  
- Capital becomes normal city (same level).  
- Cities remain on board.  

h. **Wild Card Action**  
- May perform any action.  
- If repeating an action already taken this turn, lose 1 Glory.  
- Does not grant free progress (unless empire is not in dark age).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Glory Scoring (Harvest Glory Phase)**:  
  - +1 for each government adopted.  
  - +1 for each religion adopted.  
  - +1 per progress level beyond 10.  
  - +1 per trade won.  
  - +1 for most areas in a region (Europe, Asia, etc.).  
  - +1 for most sea areas.  
  - +1 for largest empire.  
  - +1 for most advanced empire.

- **Game End Conditions**:  
  - Standard: when any empire reaches progress level 50.  
  - Rapid Aging (optional):  
    - After each turn, if any empire in current game age, advance game age by 1.  
    - If no empire in current age, eliminate lowest progress empire (tie: lowest card value; still tied: all tied empires eliminated).  
    - No empires may start below current game age.  
    - In Ages 8+, may start Age 7 empires above highest empire.  
    - No new empires if any empire at level 49.  
  - Joker Card (Playing Card Variant):  
    - If 1 full age (7 levels) between 1st and 2nd place, game ends; 1st place scores 7 Glory.  
  - King/Ace of Clubs (Playing Card Variant):  
    - King: if last player 30+ Glory behind leader, game ends.  
    - Ace: if leader 20+ Glory ahead, game ends.  

- **Victory**: Highest Glory wins. Tie: most advanced empire.
