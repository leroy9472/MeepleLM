## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the fictional city of Neustadt, real estate speculation is rampant. Following a new zoning map, two rows of houses are permitted between the Main Road and the Haul rivulet. However, developers—driven by profit and aided by dubious "special building permits"—illegally construct a third row. The mayor secretly boosts profits in one row, while players compete as property tycoons using auctions and strategic building.  

**Objective**: Score the most points by constructing houses in completed rows (positive points) and avoiding losses in incomplete rows (negative points). Strategic use of the mayor, special permits, and hidden illegal earnings determines victory.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board in the center.  
2. Put the 6 colour cubes, 4 special cubes, and mayor pawn beside the board.  
3. Randomly draw 24 floor cubes from the pouch and arrange them in **3 rows of 8**, placed pip-side up. The remaining 12 are set aside.  
4. Shuffle the 17 roof caps number-side down and place them near the board.  
5. Deal **12 cheques** to each player.  
6. Choose a starting player at random. Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, follow these steps in order:

1. **Illegal Earnings (Optional)**  
   - The active player may stash **1 cheque** under the edge of the board as illegal earnings. This cheque is out of play until scoring and is worth 1 point.

2. **Choose a Piece**  
   - Select **one** available piece:  
     - A **floor cube** from either end of any row (6 possible at start).  
     - A **roof cap** (only if at least one house on the board lacks a roof).  
     - A **special cube** (building permit or cancel).  
     - The **mayor pawn**.  
   - If a roof is chosen, flip it to reveal its number.  
     - If it shows **no number (0)**, the turn ends immediately and the roof is discarded.

3. **Auction the Chosen Piece**  
   - The current player becomes the auctioneer.  
   - Bidding starts with the next player clockwise. Each player has **one chance** to bid or pass.  
   - Bids must increase by at least **1 million** (i.e. +1 cheque).  
   - After all players have passed or bid:  
     - The auctioneer may:  
       a) **Give** the piece to the highest bidder, who pays their bid to the auctioneer.  
       b) **Keep** the piece and pay the highest bid amount to the highest bidder.  
     - If no one bids, the auctioneer takes the piece for free.

4. **Use the Auctioned Piece**  
   - The **winner of the auction** (or the auctioneer if no bid or self-purchase) now uses the piece:  
     - **Floor cube**: Must be placed if possible; otherwise discarded.  
     - **Roof cap (numbered)**: Must be placed on an unroofed house; otherwise discarded.  
     - **Special cube or mayor**: May be placed on the board or discarded.  
   - All placements or discards happen immediately.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Building Houses  
- Each row starts with **4 building lots**, from road to river.  
- Buildings are constructed **from the road outward**, with no gaps.  
- A floor cube may be:  
  - Placed on an empty lot.  
  - Stacked on another cube **only if its pip count is lower** than the one below.  
- **White-fenced lots**: Only allow **one level** (no stacking).  
- When placing the **first floor cube of a colour**, the player takes the matching **colour cube** as ownership marker.  
  - That player scores **all future houses** where that colour is the **top floor**, regardless of who built it.

#### Placing Roofs  
- A roof must be placed on a house (a stack of one or more floor cubes) that has **no roof yet**.  
- The player placing the roof may choose **any eligible house**, even if owned by another player.  
- A row is **completed** when:  
  - All permitted lots are occupied (no gaps).  
  - Every house has a roof.  

#### Special Cubes  
- **Building Permits (I, II, III)**:  
  - May extend or shorten a row by 1, 2, or 3 lots respectively.  
  - Placed at the end of a row to mark new limit.  
  - Multiple permits can be stacked on the same row.  
  - Cannot be used to make existing buildings illegal:  
    - You **cannot shorten** a row beyond its current development.  
- **Cancel Cube**:  
  - Removes **one** special cube from the board.  
  - Cannot be used if removal would make current buildings illegal.  
- **All special cubes** must be placed or discarded immediately upon acquisition.

#### Mayor  
- Placed on the grey street space in front of **any row**.  
- **Doubles all scores** (positive or negative) for that row at the end.  
- May be moved or replaced during the game. Only one mayor may be in play at a time.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Triggers  
The game ends immediately when **either** condition is met:  
- **Two rows are fully completed** (all permitted lots filled and roofed).  
- **No more houses can be completed**, due to:  
  - All 12 numbered roofs used, **or**  
  - All floor cubes used and all applicable roofs placed.  

#### Scoring  
Each house (a stack of floor cubes + roof) is scored as:  
- Sum of **all floor cube pips** + **roof number**.  
- Scored by the player who owns the **colour of the top floor**.  

**Row Status**:  
- **Completed row**: All house scores count **positively**.  
- **Incomplete row**: All house scores count **negatively**.  

**Mayor Effect**:  
- Doubles the total score of all houses in its row (positive or negative).  

**Illegal Earnings**:  
- Each stashed cheque is worth **1 point**.  

**Final Score** =  
(Sum of house scores, adjusted for row status and mayor) + (Number of stashed cheques)

#### Winning  
- Highest total score wins.  
- In case of tie: highest score wins; if still tied, compare cumulative scores across rounds (in multi-round play).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a roof on a house I didn’t build?**  
  Yes. Roof placement is independent of builder. Ownership is based on **top floor colour**.

- **Can I stack different colours?**  
  Yes. Colour does not affect stacking; only pip count matters.

- **Can I use a permit to shorten a completed row?**  
  Yes, but only if no buildings exist beyond the new limit. Shortening invalidates completion.

- **Can I discard a special cube or mayor after winning auction?**  
  Yes. You may discard instead of placing.

- **What happens if I win a 0-roof auction?**  
  You must discard it immediately; your turn ends. No placement occurs.

- **Can the mayor be auctioned multiple times?**  
  Yes. It remains available until claimed and placed.

- **Can I place a floor cube if I can’t legally stack it?**  
  Only if placing it on an empty lot. If no legal placement exists, it is discarded.
