## Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles is a tactical-level wargame simulating infantry combat during World War II, focusing on the actions of elite American paratroopers. Players command squads, weapons teams, and supporting units in historically inspired scenarios. The objective varies by scenario and may include eliminating enemy forces, holding key terrain, or achieving specific mission goals.

### 2. Components
- Unit counters (Squads, Weapons Teams, Guns, Vehicles, Artillery, Decoys)
- Terrain boards
- Command Point (CP) markers
- Suppression markers (Yellow/Red)
- Used, Op Fire, and Movement markers
- Turn marker
- Dice (d10)

### 3. Setup
- Units are placed as specified in the scenario.
- Any unit in terrain providing a positive DRM against fire (e.g., woods, buildings, hedgerows) may begin with a Conceal marker.
- Decoys may also be assigned Conceal markers.
- Players receive CPs as per scenario; CPs may be spent to modify actions.
- Half-hexes are fully playable.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of four phases:
1. **Operations Phase** – Players alternate activating units within their Operations Range.
2. **Rout Phase** – Units under stress must pass Morale Checks or retreat.
3. **Melee Phase** – Simultaneous close combat in hexes containing both enemy and friendly units.
4. **Recovery Phase** – Suppression is reduced; markers are removed; turn advances.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Stacking
- Maximum of 2 Squads/WTs (any combination) per hex at the end of movement.
- Friendly stacks may not be examined by the opponent.

#### Line of Sight (LOS)
- Determined from hex center to hex center.
- LOS blocked if intervening terrain (building, trees, hedgerow) is visible from both sides of the line.
- Terrain in firing and target hexes does not block LOS.
- Hedgerows block LOS if the line crosses or runs along a hedgerow hexside not on the perimeter of the firing or target hex.

#### Morale and Proficiency Checks
- **Morale Check (MC):** d10 ≤ current Morale.
- **Proficiency Check (PC):** d10 + Proficiency ≤ current Morale.
- A CP may be spent to re-roll one check per unit per turn.

#### Movement
- **Squads:** 5 MP; **WTs:** 4 MP.
- A unit must pass a Morale Check to move.
- If starting in an enemy hex, must pass a Proficiency Check and cannot enter another enemy hex that turn.
- A unit may declare a retreat before its Morale Check, gaining +4 DRM.
- Movement stops if an enemy hex is entered (Melee).
- Concealed units are revealed if:
  - Adjacent to a friendly unit, or
  - In open ground and in LOS of a friendly unit.
- A moving unit may gain Conceal if it leaves all enemy LOS during movement.
- Moving units may be targeted by:
  - **Op Fire** from un-Used enemy units.
  - **Final Op Fire** from adjacent Used enemy units.
- A CP may be spent to allow a Used unit to Final Op Fire at a target within normal range (not just adjacent).
- If a moving unit suffers suppression from fire, it must pass a Morale Check to continue moving.
- If it fails, movement stops; if overstacking results, unit retreats to previous hex.

#### Terrain MP Costs
- Clear: 1
- Building/Woods: 2
- Along road: ½ MP (Squad), ⅔ MP (WT)
- Cross hedgerow: +1 MP
- Higher elevation: +1 MP
- Rivers/canals: impassable

#### Fire
- Target must be within range and LOS.
- Cannot fire from or into a hex containing an enemy unit (except Close Assault).
- Cannot fire into a hex with friendly units.
- Units fire individually; no combining.
- Unit must pass Morale Check to fire.
- Unit is marked Used after firing (even if check fails).
- **Range:**
  - Normal range: full FP.
  - Extended range (normal < range ≤ 2×normal): half FP (rounded down).
  - Mortars have minimum range but no maximum.

#### Fire Procedure
- Roll 1d10 (10 = automatic miss).
- Apply modifiers:
  - **Terrain Modifiers (non-cumulative, best only):**
    - Fortification: +3 DRM
    - Stone Building: +2 DRM
    - Wooden Building: +1 DRM
    - Behind Hedgerow: +2 DRM (0 vs Mortars)
    - Foxhole: +2 DRM (+4 vs Mortars)
    - Woods: +1 DRM (–1 vs Mortars)
    - Foxhole + Woods: +2 DRM
    - Higher elevation: +1 DRM
    - Lower elevation: –1 DRM
  - **Other Modifiers (cumulative):**
    - Concealed target: +1 DRM
    - Final Op Fire: +2 DRM
    - Assault Fire: +1 DRM
    - Directed Mortar Fire: +1 DRM
    - Adjacent target: –3 DRM
    - Moving in open, range ≤4: –4 DRM
    - Moving in open, 4 < range ≤8: –2 DRM
    - Moving not in open, range ≤8: –1 DRM
- Apply result to all units in target hex:
  - Result ≤ FP – 2nd Casualty: eliminated
  - Result ≤ FP – 1st Casualty: reduced and fully suppressed
  - Result ≤ FP: suppressed one step
- Concealed units are revealed if suppressed.

#### Assault Fire (Squads only)
- Move, then fire after movement.
- Must pass Proficiency Check to fire.
- +1 DRM for Assault Fire.
- Unit is marked Used after attack.

#### Opportunity Fire (Op Fire)
- May be conducted by un-Used units.
- Triggered when enemy unit enters a new hex.
- May be conducted in starting hex only if moving into Melee.
- Must pass Proficiency Check.
- Modifiers:
  - Target in open: –1 to Proficiency
  - Target adjacent: –1 to Proficiency
  - Firing unit prepared for Op Fire: –1 to Proficiency
- Proficiency never below 0.
- If check passed, resolve fire; mark unit Used (remove Op Fire marker if present).
- If check failed, unit is not marked Used and may attempt again.

#### Final Op Fire
- Conducted by Used units.
- Normally only against adjacent moving units.
- A CP may be spent to extend range to normal (not extended).
- Must pass Proficiency Check.
- Modifiers:
  - Target in open: –1 to Proficiency
  - Target adjacent: –1 to Proficiency
- +2 DRM to attack roll.
- If check passed, resolve fire with +2 DRM.

#### Melee
- Occurs in hexes with both enemy and friendly units.
- Simultaneous resolution.
- Each unit rolls 2d10 (no modifiers).
- Each die ≤ FP eliminates one enemy unit (owner's choice).
- Full-strength WT: FP = 2; Reduced WT: FP = 1.
- WTs are eliminated if hit (not reduced).
- A CP may be spent per melee to re-roll both dice for one unit.

#### Command Points (CP)
- One CP may be used per unit per turn.
- CPs may be used to:
  1. Re-roll a Morale Check.
  2. Allow second-player activation before first player.
  3. Conduct Final Op Fire beyond adjacent hex (within normal range).
  4. Re-roll a melee combat roll (one per side per melee).
  5. Increase Proficient Firepower by 1 (cannot exceed normal FP).

#### Conceal & Decoy
- Units may start concealed in beneficial terrain.
- Decoys may be concealed and marked for Op Fire but cannot fire.
- Concealment lost if:
  - Suppressed
  - Adjacent to enemy infantry or unmounted gun
  - In open ground and in enemy LOS
  - Resolves fire or assault
  - Vehicle and in enemy LOS or moves
- Unit may re-conceal if it ends movement outside enemy LOS.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Victory conditions are scenario-specific (e.g., elimination, control of objectives).
- Decoys do not count as surviving units for elimination objectives.
- Game ends when scenario victory conditions are met.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **LOS Check Failure:** If a unit attempts to fire and LOS is blocked, it is marked Used.
- **Overstacking:** If movement causes overstacking, unit returns to previous hex (no cost, no Op Fire).
- **Rout Path:** Must move toward cover; cannot move adjacent to or closer to enemy in LOS. If impossible, unit is eliminated.
- **Melee CP Use:** CP spent to re-roll both dice; only one CP allowed per side per melee.
- **Final Op Fire Range:** Normally adjacent; CP extends to normal range.
- **Artillery & Mortars:** May trace LOS from adjacent hex (Directed Fire); mortar Op Fire only after second hex of movement.
