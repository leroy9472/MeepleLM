## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The **Solo Heroclix Rules (Alpha 0.1)** are designed to enable solo play for the Heroclix miniatures game during times when playing against a human opponent is not possible. The rules focus on **thematic, scenario-based gameplay**, where the player controls one team while an automated opponent controls the enemy team. The goal is to simulate a dynamic and challenging experience through a simple AI system, emphasizing story-driven missions rather than competitive balance.

### 2. Components  
No additional physical components are required beyond a standard Heroclix set, including:  
- Heroclix miniatures with dials  
- Map with grid squares (standard Heroclix map)  
- Two six-sided dice (2d6)  
- Action tokens  
- Hindering and blocking terrain (as needed by scenario)  
- Player’s team and opponent’s team (enemy) miniatures  

The **Combat Event Roll** uses 2d6 and requires tracking the result each turn.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Build Teams**:  
   - Choose a player team (controlled by you) and an enemy team (automated).  
   - Teams may be built using standard point limits or scenario-specific rules.  
2. **Determine First Player**:  
   - Roll a d6; highest roll chooses who goes first.  
3. **Place Models**:  
   - Set up both teams according to standard Heroclix placement rules or scenario instructions.  
4. **Prepare Tracking Tools**:  
   - Keep action tokens, dice, and the Combat Event Chart accessible.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in alternating turns. The **player takes full control of their team**; the **opponent’s actions are automated**.

**Turn Sequence**:  
1. **Player Turn**:  
   - Take up to 3 actions (move, close combat, ranged combat, power, free).  
   - Follow standard Heroclix rules.  
2. **Opponent Turn**:  
   - **Step 1**: Roll 2d6 for **Combat Event** – apply effect to all enemies.  
   - **Step 2**: Opponent takes up to 3 actions following automated rules.  
   - **Step 3**: Resolve actions (movement, attacks, powers).  
   - **Step 4**: Clear action tokens at end of turn (unless Colossal Stamina applies).  
   - Repeat until game ends.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Combat Event Roll (2d6)  
At the **start of each opponent turn**, roll 2d6 and apply the effect to **all enemies**. The effect lasts until the next opponent turn.  

| Roll | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 2 | **Military Grade Weapons**: All enemies deal +1 damage. |
| 3 | **Armored**: All enemies reduce damage taken by 1. |
| 4 | **Adrenaline Rush**: All enemies get +1 to all rolls and +1 speed. |
| 5 | **Let Them Have It!**: All enemies gain **Flurry**. |
| 6 | **Only A Flesh Wound!**: Highest-value enemy heals 1 click (if damaged). |
| 7 | **Multitasking**: Enemies may hold up to 2 action tokens. Opponent still limited to 3 actions. |
| 8 | **Marksmanship**: Lines of fire ignore hindering terrain. |
| 9 | **In Range!**: Enemies with range > 0 get +1 range. |
| 10 | **Empty The Mag!**: Enemies with range > 0 get +1 bolt (target) for ranged attacks. |
| 11 | **A Great Plan**: Remove 1 action token from each enemy. |
| 12 | **Back For More**: Revive highest-value KO’ed enemy and place in starting area. |

> Keep the 2d6 roll visible to track the active effect.

#### Automated Opponent Rules  
The enemy team follows these priority rules:

1. **Must use all 3 actions** if possible.  
2. **Attack > Movement > Defense** in priority.  
3. **Assign actions to enemies who can attack** first.  
   - If multiple attackers possible:  
     - Use **Tie-Breakers (optional)** or choose randomly.  
4. **If no attack possible**, assign to enemies who can move into attack range.  
   - Use **Tie-Breakers for Movement** or choose randomly.  
5. **If no attack or movement into range**, move enemies with no action token, prioritizing those farthest from player models.  
6. **Power Use**:  
   - Enemies with **Outwit** or similar cancel powers in this order:  
     1. Attack-enhancing (e.g., Flurry, Charge)  
     2. Defense-enhancing (e.g., Combat Reflexes, Super Senses)  
     3. Movement-enhancing (e.g., Leap/Climb, Sidestep)  
7. **Target Selection**:  
   - If multiple valid targets:  
     - Use **Target Selection Priorities** or choose randomly.  
8. **Unclear Situations**:  
   - Assign probabilities and roll a die to resolve.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory Conditions**: Determined by scenario.  
  - Examples: Defeat all enemies, survive X turns, rescue objective, etc.  
- No universal scoring system; game ends when scenario goal is met or failed.  
- **KO’ed Models**: Removed from play unless revived (e.g., Combat Event 12).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Golden Rule**: All standard Heroclix 2021 rules and PAC apply unless overridden.  
- **Combat Event Duration**: Lasts until next opponent turn.  
- **Flurry from Event 5**: Applies to all enemies; allows second close combat attack as free action.  
- **Revival (Event 12)**: Only highest-value KO’ed enemy; placed in starting area.
