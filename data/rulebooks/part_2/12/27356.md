## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

**Lore:**  
London, 1921. The world-famous Portobello Market is coming to life as vendors set up their stalls. Players take on the role of market traders aiming to strategically place their stalls and attract customers to maximize profits.

**Objective:**  
The player with the most victory points (VP) at the end of the game wins. Points are earned by:
- Scoring alleys (lanes) when filled with stalls and flanked by customers.
- Scoring districts using action counters.
- Scoring uncompleted alleys during the final Lord (Baron) scoring, if applicable.

  - 5 Servants (gray)  
  - 5 Bourgeois (pink)  
  - 1 Lord (black, also called "Baron")

### 3. Setup

1. Place the game board in the center.
2. Each player takes:
   - Market stalls based on player count.
   - Action counters “2”, “3”, “4” in their color.
   - Matching scoring marker and player board.
3. Place all player action counters **face-up** under the awnings on their boards.
4. Stack neutral gray action counters next to the board: **3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1** (top to bottom).
5. Place Bobby and Lord next to the board.
6. Place 5 Servants and 5 Bourgeois in the bag; place bag next to board.
7. All scoring markers start at **10 VP** on the track.
8. Determine starting player (e.g., last person to visit London).
9. The player to the **right of the starter** places the Bobby on any Bobby-field (district center).

### 4. Gameplay Flow

Players take turns clockwise. On a turn, a player must do **one** of the following:

#### Option A: Take Actions (using a face-up action counter)
- Choose one of your **face-up** action counters (“2”, “3”, or “4”).
- Flip it **face-down** under your awning.
- Perform **that number of actions**, in any order and combination of:
  1. **Place a market stall**
  2. **Place a customer**
- You may perform the same action multiple times.
- You may move the Bobby **any number of times during your turn**, before, between, or after actions. This does **not** count as an action.

#### Option B: Score a District (skip actions)
- Use your **face-up "2" or "4"** action counter.
- Place it on **an unmarked district** (only one counter per district).
- Do **not** place stalls, customers, or move the Bobby this turn.
- Immediately score the district (see District Scoring).
- Take the **top gray neutral action counter** and place it **face-up** under your awning.
- Your used counter remains face-down.

After all three of a player’s action counters are face-down, they are **reset to face-up** at the start of their next turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### 1. Place a Market Stall
- Place one of your stalls on an **empty space in an alley adjacent to the current Bobby’s district**.
- First stall in an alley: may be placed at **either end**.
- Subsequent stalls: must be placed **adjacent** to the last-placed stall in that alley (chain grows from one end).
- Alley spaces have values: 1, 2, or 3 — these determine scoring points.

#### 2. Place a Customer
- Draw **blindly** from the bag.
- Place the customer on **any empty plaza**.
- Bobby’s position **does not matter** for this action.
- After placing, the next action may proceed.

**Lord Placement Trigger:**  
When the **10th customer** is placed (i.e., the last gray/pink customer), the **Lord is immediately placed** on the **last remaining empty plaza**. This is automatic and **not a player action**.

#### 3. Move the Bobby
- May be done **any number of times** during your turn, at any time.
- Move the Bobby **along alleys**, never over plazas.
- To cross an alley, pay VP based on **majority of stalls** in that alley:

| Alley Condition | Payment |
|-----------------|---------|
| You have **strict majority** | 0 VP (free) |
| Alley is **empty** | Pay 1 VP (to bank) |
| Another player has **strict majority** | Pay 1 VP **to that player** |
| Two or more players **tie for majority** | Pay 1 VP **to each** of them |

- **Payment effect:** Paying player moves scoring marker **down** 1; receiving player(s) move **up** 1.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Alley Scoring (Immediate)
An alley scores **immediately** when:
- All spaces are filled with stalls.
- There is a **customer on each end plaza** (connected to the alley).

**Scoring Process:**
1. Each player sums the **values** of their stalls in the alley (e.g., 3 + 1 + 2 = 6).
2. Multiply this sum by a **multiplier** based on the two end customers:

| End Customers | Multiplier |
|---------------|------------|
| 2 Servants (gray) | ×1 |
| Servant + Bourgeois (gray + pink) | ×2 |
| 2 Bourgeois (pink) | ×3 |
| Lord + Servant | ×3 |
| Lord + Bourgeois | ×4 |

- Points are added **immediately** to VP track.
- Only players with stalls in the alley score.
- Multiple alleys may score in one turn.

#### District Scoring (Active Player Only)
- May be done **twice per player** during the game (once with “2”, once with “4”).
- On your turn, place your face-up “2” or “4” counter on an **empty district**.
- Score: **Number of your stalls in alleys bordering the district × value of your action counter**.
- Example: 4 of your stalls around the district × 4 = 16 VP.
- After scoring, take the **top gray neutral action counter** and place it face-up under your awning.
- Your used counter is now unavailable until reset.

#### End Game Trigger
- When **any player places their last market stall**, that is their **final turn**.
- Play continues clockwise until **all players have taken an equal number of turns** in that round.
- Then the game ends.

#### Lord Scoring (Final Scoring)
- **Only occurs if the Lord is on the board.**
- Score **each alley** that:
  - Has the **Lord on one end plaza**, and
  - Is **not already scored** (even if not full).
- Scoring:
  - Sum the **values** of each player’s stalls in the alley.
  - Multiply using:
    - Lord + Servant → ×3
    - Lord + Bourgeois → ×4
  - Add points to VP track.

Unfilled alleys **without** the Lord on an end are **not scored**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can I move the Bobby multiple times in one turn?**  
  Yes. As many times as you want, before, between, or after actions.

- **Can I score an alley when placing a customer?**  
  Yes. If placing a customer completes both ends of a filled alley, it scores immediately.

- **Can I score a district and place a customer in the same turn?**  
  No. Scoring a district **is** your entire turn. You do nothing else.

- **What if the bag is empty but the Lord isn’t placed yet?**  
  The Lord is placed **after the 10th customer is placed**, so this cannot happen. The 10th draw triggers Lord placement.

- **What if two players tie for most stalls in an alley during Bobby movement?**  
  The moving player must pay **1 VP to each** of the tied players.

- **Can I use a neutral action counter to score a district?**  
  No. Only your colored “2” or “4” counters can be used for district scoring.

- **Do alleys score during district scoring?**  
  Only if conditions are met — scoring a district doesn’t prevent alley scoring if an alley fills during the same turn.

- **What if the Lord is not on the board at game end?**  
  The Lord scoring **does not occur**.

- **Tie in final score?**  
  Multiple winners — no tiebreaker.
