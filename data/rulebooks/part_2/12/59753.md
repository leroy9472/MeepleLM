## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Priests of Ra*, players take on the roles of priests vying for divine favor from the sun god Ra. By drawing tiles representing elements of ancient Egyptian society—people, buildings, priests, plagues, pyramids, and ankhs—players accumulate fame through strategic collection and auctioning. The goal is to earn the most fame points over three epochs (rounds). In case of a tie, the player with the highest-numbered sun token wins.

2. Components  
- 174 tiles:  
  - People: 30 Farmers/Warriors, 30 Merchants/Scribes  
  - Buildings: 15 Granaries/Fortresses, 15 Markets/Libraries  
  - Priests: 15  
  - Plagues: 10  
  - Pyramids: 15 (7 green/red, 7 blue/yellow, 1 colorless)  
  - Ra Tiles: 30  
- Sun tokens: Numbered tokens used for turn order and endgame scoring  
- Auction track (Ra track): Space to place auction tiles; fills up to trigger epoch end  
- Player boards (optional): Track collected tiles and scoring

3. Setup  
- Determine player count (2–5 players).  
- Distribute sun tokens based on player count:  
  - 2 players: Use sets [9-6-5-2] and [8-7-4-3] — each player takes one set  
  - 3 players: Use [13-8-5-2], [12-9-6-3], [11-10-7-4] — one set per player  
  - 4 players: Use [13-6-2], [12-7-3], [11-8-4], [10-9-5] — one set per player  
  - 5 players: Use [16-7-2], [15-8-3], [14-9-4], [13-10-5], [12-11-6] — one set per player  
- Each player starts with their sun tokens placed face-up.  
- Shuffle tile deck and place it within reach.  
- Place Ra track nearby.  
- The player with the highest-numbered sun begins the first epoch.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each epoch proceeds in turns until it ends.  
On a player’s turn:  
- If they have at least one face-up sun token, they must take exactly one action.  
- If all their suns are face-down, they take no action and skip their turn.

Available actions:  
1. **Draw a Tile (1 of 174)**  
   - Draw the top tile from the deck.  
   - Place it face-up in your personal play area.  
   - Choose which side to reveal (some tiles have two different types).  

2. **Invoke Ra (Start an Auction)**  
   - Announce the auction.  
   - Draw a Ra tile and place it on the Ra track.  
   - This triggers an immediate auction (see below).  
   - The active player **may not pass** if all others pass — they must win the auction in that case.  

Epoch may also end when:  
- The Ra track becomes full (after resolving the auction).  
- A Ra tile is drawn during tile draw (immediately triggers auction; may lead to epoch end).  
- All players have no face-up suns remaining.  

When any of these conditions occur, the epoch ends immediately:  
- All unclaimed tiles (in center and on Ra track) are discarded.  
- Players score for the epoch (see Scoring).  
- All sun tokens are flipped back face-up.  
- The player with the highest-numbered sun token starts the next epoch.  
- Game ends after the third epoch — proceed to final scoring.

5. Core Mechanics  
**Auctions**  
- Triggered by:  
  - A player invoking Ra  
  - Drawing a Ra tile from the deck  
  - Ra track fills completely  

- Auction process:  
  - All players, starting clockwise from the active player, bid or pass.  
  - Players may pass at any time.  
  - Once a player passes, they are out of the auction.  
  - The active player (who invoked Ra or drew the Ra tile) bids last.  
  - If all other players pass, the active player **must** place a bid (cannot pass).  

- Auction resolution:  
  - The winner takes all tiles currently on the Ra track.  
  - They also take the highest-numbered **face-up** sun token currently on the board.  
  - That sun token is kept **face-down** (removed from turn order for remainder of epoch).  
  - The auction winner places the sun token they won onto the board **face-up** (used for future turn order).  
  - **Special effect**: Gaining a sun via auction allows the winner to **flip one tile** in their play area (reveal its other side).

6. Scoring & End Game  
**Epoch Scoring (after each of 3 epochs)**  
- **People (Farmers/Warriors, Merchants/Scribes):**  
  - Must have at least 2 of the same type to score.  
  - Player with **most** of a type scores +5 points.  
  - If tied for most, **all tied players** score +5.  
  - No points if fewer than 2.  
  - After scoring, **discard all people tiles**.  

- **Buildings (Granaries/Fortresses, Markets/Libraries):**  
  - Score 2 points for each **completed pair** (two of same type).  
  - Bonuses:  
    - 3 different types of pairs: +5 points  
    - 4 different types of pairs: +10 points  
  - Buildings **are kept** for future epochs.  

- **Priests:**  
  - Score 2 points for each priest.  
  - If you have **3 or more priests**, you may discard **1 plague tile** before plagues are scored.  
  - Discard all priests after scoring.  

- **Plagues:**  
  - Score penalty based on number of plagues held:  
    - 1 plague: -1  
    - 2: -3  
    - 3: -6  
    - 4: -10  
    - 5: -15  
    - 6+: -20  
  - Plagues are **scored only at game end** (after 3rd epoch), **not** each epoch.  
  - However, priests’ ability to remove a plague triggers **before** final plague scoring.

**Endgame Scoring (after 3rd epoch)**  
- **Pyramids:**  
  - Must be in ascending order (steps) to score.  
    - 2 steps: 5 points  
    - 3 steps: 10 points  
    - 4 steps: 20 points  
  - Color bonuses:  
    - 3 of same color: +5 points  
    - 4+ of same color: +10 points  

- **Ankhs:**  
  - 2 ankhs: +5 points  
  - 3 ankhs: +10 points  
  - 4+ ankhs: +20 points  

- **Sun Tokens:**  
  - Player with **highest total** sun values: +5 points  
  - Player with **lowest total** sun values: -5 points  
  - If tied for highest or lowest:  
    - Tied for highest: each gets +5  
    - Tied for lowest: each gets -5  

**Final Victory**  
- Total all points from:  
  - 3 rounds of epoch scoring (people, buildings, priests)  
  - Final scoring (pyramids, ankhs, suns, plagues)  
- Player with **most points wins**.  
- Tiebreaker: highest-numbered sun token.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I invoke Ra if I have no suns?**  
  No. Only players with at least one face-up sun may take actions, including invoking Ra.

- **What happens when a Ra tile is drawn during a draw action?**  
  The auction begins immediately. The drawn Ra tile is placed on the track. The player who drew it does **not** get to place a tile — their turn ends, and auction proceeds.

- **Can I pass when the Ra track is full?**  
  Yes. If you pass, the auction tiles are discarded. If all pass, the active player must bid.

- **What if I win an auction but have no face-up suns?**  
  You still win the auction. You take the highest face-up sun (if any exist). If none are face-up, no sun is awarded — but you still get the tiles.

- **Can I flip a tile if I win a sun from an auction?**  
  Yes. Any time you gain a sun token (via auction), you may immediately flip one tile in your play area to its other side.

- **Are buildings scored each epoch?**  
  Yes. You score building pairs and bonuses every epoch. Buildings remain in play.

- **Are people and priests scored each epoch?**  
  Yes. They are scored and then discarded each epoch.

- **When are plagues scored?**  
  Only once — at the end of the game (after 3rd epoch). But the priest ability to remove a plague triggers before this scoring.
