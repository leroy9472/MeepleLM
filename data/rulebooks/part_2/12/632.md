## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
- Objective: Be the first player to reach 50 or more points. After any player reaches 50 points, finish the current round. The player with the most points wins.  
- In case of a tie, the player with the fewest cards in hand wins.

2. Components  
- 72 Balloon Cards: 18 each in four colors (green, purple, red, yellow)  
- 4 Wild Cards (Umbrella cards)  
- 4 Special 6-sided dice: Each die has one side per color (green, purple, red, yellow), and two blank sides  
- 6 Wooden Pawns (player tokens/passenger markers)  
- 6 Wooden Cylinders (scoring markers)  
- 1 Elevated Rubber Balloon Basket (used as game centerpiece)  
- 1 Game Board with scoring track from 1 to 50  
- Rules Booklet

3. Setup  
- Deal 6 Balloon Cards to each player.  
- Place the game board in the center.  
- Each player places their pawn in the balloon basket (starting position).  
- Place scoring cylinders on the 0 space of the track.  
- The starting Pilot (active player) is chosen randomly or by agreement.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of multiple trips. A trip proceeds as follows:

1. **Start at Current Level**: The balloon begins at cloud level 1 unless continuing from a previous successful ascent.  
2. **Pilot Rolls Dice**: The Pilot rolls a number of dice equal to the current cloud level (e.g., 1 die at level 1, 2 dice at level 2, etc.).  
3. **Non-Pilot Decisions**:  
   - Going clockwise from the Pilot, each non-Pilot player chooses to **stay** or **leave**.  
   - Players who **leave** immediately score points equal to the current cloud level and remove their pawn from the balloon.  
   - The Pilot **cannot leave** until all other players have left.  
4. **Pilot Card Matching**:  
   - The Pilot must match each non-blank die result by playing a card of the same color from their hand.  
   - One Wild card may be played to match a single die (optional — Pilot may choose not to play it even if available).  
   - If the Pilot cannot match all non-blank dice, the trip **fails**.  
5. **Trip Outcomes**:  
   - **Success**: If all dice are matched, the balloon ascends to the next cloud level.  
     - If at least one non-Pilot player remains in the balloon, the Pilot role passes to the next remaining player to the left.  
     - The new Pilot continues the trip at the new level.  
   - **Failure**: If the Pilot cannot match the dice, the trip fails.  
     - All remaining players still in the balloon score **0 points** for this trip.  
     - They are removed from the balloon.  
6. **End of Trip**:  
   - Triggered when the trip fails OR when the Pilot decides to leave (only allowed when no other players remain).  
   - After the trip ends:  
     - All players draw 1 card.  
     - The balloon level resets to 1.  
     - The player to the left of the last Pilot becomes the new Pilot.  
   - A new trip begins.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Dice Rolling**: Number of dice = current cloud level. Each die shows one of four colors or blank. Only colored results must be matched.  
- **Card Play**:  
  - Must play one card per colored die.  
  - Wild cards can substitute for any one color.  
  - Playing a Wild is optional.  
- **Player Choice**:  
  - Non-Pilots choose to stay (risk 0 if trip fails) or leave (secure current level points).  
  - Pilot cannot leave until all others have left.  
- **Pilot Rotation**:  
  - After a successful ascent with remaining players, Pilot passes left among those still in the balloon.  
  - After trip ends, new Pilot is the player to the left of the last Pilot (regardless of participation).  
- **Card Draw**: All players draw 1 card after every trip (success or failure).

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Players score points only when they **leave the balloon** voluntarily.  
- Points scored = current cloud level at time of exit.  
- If the trip **fails**, all remaining players score **0**.  
- Game ends when **any player reaches 50 or more points**.  
- **Finish the current round** (all trips initiated before the threshold are completed).  
- Final scoring:  
  - Highest score wins.  
  - Tiebreaker: Fewest cards in hand (lower is better).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can the Pilot leave early?**  
  No. The Pilot may only leave when no other players are still in the balloon.  
- **Must a Wild card be played if available?**  
  No. The Pilot may choose not to play a Wild card even if it would allow success.  
- **What if all non-Pilot players leave?**  
  The Pilot may then choose to leave (scoring current level) or attempt to continue alone.  
- **How many dice are rolled at each level?**  
  Equal to the current cloud level (1 die at level 1, 2 at level 2, etc.).  
- **What happens to players who leave?**  
  They score points immediately and are out for the rest of the trip.  
- **Do players draw cards during a trip?**  
  No. Card draw occurs only after the entire trip ends.  
- **Can the same player be Pilot twice in a row?**  
  Only if all players left during the previous trip and the turn passes back to them.
