## Axis & Allies D-Day – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
June 6, 1944: The Allied forces launch the largest amphibious invasion in history on the beaches of Normandy. In *Axis & Allies D-Day*, players take control of either the Allied (American/British) or Axis (German) forces in a tactical reenactment of the D-Day landings. The objective centers on capturing and holding key cities—Caen, St. Lô, and Cherbourg—while managing reinforcements, naval and airborne assaults, and battlefield tactics.

### 2. Components  
- Extra-large game board depicting the Normandy battlefield  
- Order and Tactics cards (numbered and categorized)  
- Plastic military units: infantry, artillery, tanks (by nation)  
- Blockhouse units (new unit type)  
- White and black dice (used for combat resolution)  
- Reinforcement charts (with silhouettes for unit placement)  
- Air units: fighters (cazas), bombers (bombarderos)  
- Airfield and beachhead zones  
- Fortification placement markers  

### 3. Setup  
- **Players**: 2–3 players (Americans, British, Germans)  
- **Initial Units**: Pre-placed according to scenario; Americans start in airborne zones (Gauveur, Audouville), beachheads (Utah Beach), and naval zones; Germans occupy inland zones and blockhouses.  
- **Order Deck**: Shuffle Order Cards (numbered 01–16) and place them face down.  
- **Tactics & Fortune Cards**: Separate decks used for special effects; shuffled and drawn as per rules.  
- **Reinforcement Charts**: Units are staged off-board, entering play via dice rolls during reinforcement phases.  
- **Air Units**: Fighters and bombers begin off-board or at airfields.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in a fixed sequence of phases, each triggered by drawing and resolving an **Order Card** in numerical order (01–16). Each card dictates a specific phase of the battle. After card 16, the deck is reshuffled if needed.

#### Turn Sequence (by Order Card):
1. **01: Airborne Assault** – American paratroopers attack:  
   - Roll 1 white die per infantry in Gauveur and Audouville.  
   - Each "1" scores a hit.  
   - Germans remove one unit per hit (blockhouses immune).  
   - Remove card after use.  

2. **02: Naval Bombardment** – Americans target blockhouses:  
   - Roll 6 white dice; each 1–2 is a hit on a selected blockhouse.  
   - If hit, remove the blockhouse.  
   - Optional version: Bombard coastal zones (1–2 hit on any unit).  

3. **03: Fighter Patrol** – Allies place up to 4 fighters per zone.  

4. **04: Anti-Aircraft Fire (vs Fighters)** – Germans roll 1 black die per artillery in zones with enemy fighters. Each "1" scores a hit.  

5. **05: Bomber Attack** – Allies place bombers in zones without friendly ground units.  
   - Roll 1 white die per bomber; 1–2–3 is a hit on selected Axis units.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Combat Resolution**:  
  - White dice = Allied rolls; Black dice = Axis rolls.  
  - Hits remove one unit per hit.  
  - Attacker chooses target unless specified.  
- **Unit Movement**:  
  - Standard: 1 zone  
  - Tanks: 2 zones if no enemy in first zone  
  - Beachhead units: Can only land during **Allied Landing (10)**  
- **Artillery Rules (Dimensional Battlefield Variant)**:  
  - Can fire on same or adjacent zones.  
  - Does not roll during combat but can be chosen as casualty.  
- **Air Combat**:  
  - Fighters patrol zones and intercept movement.  
  - Anti-aircraft fire: 1 black die per artillery; "1" = hit.  
- **Order of Resolution**: Cards are played in strict numerical order. Optional cards (e.g., 09a, 11a) are inserted after their base card if used.  
- **Tactics Cards**: One-time use cards that modify gameplay (e.g., re-roll, extra damage, sabotage). Removed after use.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Victory Conditions  
- **Standard (Allies)**: Capture and hold **Caen, St. Lô, and Cherbourg** for one full turn. Game ends after 9 turns if not achieved.  
- **Optional (Allies)**: Capture all three cities by the end of **Turn 10**.  
- **Standard (Axis)**: Prevent Allies from holding all three cities for a full turn.  
- **Optional (Axis)**: Prevent Allied control of all three cities at the end of Turn 10.  
- **Alternative Win Conditions**:  
  - Americans win if they occupy **Valognes** alone or eliminate all German units.  
  - Germans win if they eliminate all American units.  

#### Turn Continuation Rule  
- If Allies have **12 or more units** on the board after Turn 10, the game continues.  
- This repeats until Allies have fewer than 12 units or control all three victory cities.  

#### Reinforcement Phase (Post-Turn 10)  
- After Turn 10, each army (German, American, British) rolls 1 die.  
- Result = number of reinforcement units placed (right to left on reinforcement chart).  
- Rolling a **6** = no reinforcements that turn.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can blockhouses be destroyed by paratroopers?**  
  No. Blockhouses cannot be targeted during Airborne Assault. Only Naval Bombardment can destroy them.  
- **Can artillery be destroyed in combat?**  
  Yes. Artillery does not roll during combat but can be selected as a casualty.  
- **What happens if a fighter is destroyed during patrol?**  
  It is removed and must return via **Cazas Regresan (16)** or **Refuerzos**.  
- **Can units move through multiple zones during Allied Movement?**  
  Normally no. Only **Vias Despejadas** (Fortune Card 08, result 1) allows 2-zone movement.  
- **Can you attack multiple zones during combat phases?**  
  Normally yes, unless restricted (e.g., Fortune Card 11 result 6 limits Allies to one zone).  
- **Are beachhead units involved in combat before landing?**  
  No. They are only vulnerable to blockhouse fire. Combat begins after **Allied Landing (10)**.  
- **Can you place more than 8 units in a beachhead?**  
  No. Maximum of 8 ground units allowed per beachhead (per Tactic Card 09).
