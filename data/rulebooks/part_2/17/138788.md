## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The Dungeon lies before you! With a party of companions and tricks at your disposal, players risk danger to seek glory and fame by delving deep into the dungeon. The objective is to gain the most Experience (XP) after three delves per player by defeating monsters, opening chests, defeating dragons, and managing resources.

2. Components  
- 7 White Party Dice (Champion, Fighter, Cleric, Mage, Thief, Scroll)  
- 7 Black Dungeon Dice (Goblin, Skeleton, Ooze, Chest, Potion, Dragon)

- 36 Treasure Tokens:  
  - Vorpal Sword (3): Use as one Fighter  
  - Talisman (3): Use as one Cleric  
  - Scepter of Power (3): Use as one Mage  
  - Thieves’ Tools (3): Use as one Thief  
  - Scroll (3): Use as one Scroll  
  - Ring of Invisibility (4): Return all dice from Dragon’s Lair to pool (does not count as defeating the dragon)  
  - Dragon Scales (6): Worth 2 XP per pair at endgame  
  - Potion (3): Revive one Party die, choose its face  
  - Dragon Bait (4): Turn all monsters into Dragons, move to Lair  
  - Town Portal (4): Gain XP equal to Level Die; end delve. Worth 2 XP unused.  
- 24 Experience Tokens  
- 8 Hero Cards (Commander, Paladin, Battlemage, Necromancer, Dragon Slayer, Half-Goblin, Enchantress, Bard)  
- 4 Player Aid Cards  
- Rulebook and Book of Heroes  

3. Setup  
- Place all Treasure tokens in the box, hidden from view.  
- Give one Hero card to each player (randomly or by choice). Heroes start on Novice side.  
- The player who was most recently underground becomes the starting Adventurer.  
- The player to the Adventurer’s left becomes the Dungeon Lord.  
- The Adventurer rolls all 7 Party Dice to form their starting party.  
- The Dungeon Lord sets the Level Die to 1 and rolls 1 Dungeon Die to begin.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each player takes a turn as the Adventurer in clockwise order. Each turn (a "delve") consists of multiple dungeon levels and ends when the player Retires or Flee. Each player completes 3 delves total.

A delve proceeds in phases per level:

1. Monster Phase  
   a) Use Scrolls to reroll any number of Dungeon or Party Dice (Dragon faces cannot be rerolled).  
   b) Activate Hero’s Specialty or Ultimate ability (if available).  
   c) Use active Party dice to defeat monsters:  
      - Fighter: defeats 1 Skeleton, 1 Ooze, or any number of Goblins; opens 1 Chest  
      - Cleric: defeats 1 Goblin, 1 Ooze, or any number of Skeletons; opens 1 Chest  
      - Mage: defeats 1 Goblin, 1 Skeleton, or any number of Oozes; opens 1 Chest  
      - Thief: defeats 1 Goblin, 1 Skeleton, or 1 Ooze; opens any number of Chests  
      - Champion: defeats any number of one monster type (Goblin, Skeleton, Ooze); opens any number of Chests  
   - Used dice go to the Graveyard before effect resolution.  
   - If not all monsters are defeated, the Adventurer flees—delve ends with no XP.

2. Loot Phase  
   a) Open Chests:  
      - Thief or Champion: open any number  
      - Other companions: open 1 each  
      - Draw 1 Treasure token per Chest opened (from box). If none remain, gain 1 XP instead.  
   b) Quaff Potions:  
      - Any single Party die (including Scroll) may be used to quaff all Potions in the level.  
      - For each Potion, revive 1 die from the Graveyard and choose its face.  
   - Unused Chests and Potions return to the pool.

3. Dragon Phase  
   - If 3+ dice are in the Dragon’s Lair, the Dragon appears.  
   - Defeat it by using three different Companion types (e.g., Fighter, Mage, Thief). Treasure tokens acting as companions count.  
   - If defeated:  
     - All dice in Dragon’s Lair return to the pool  
     - Gain 1 Treasure token  
     - Gain 1 XP  
   - If failed: Adventurer flees—delve ends, no XP.

4. Regroup Phase  
   - Choose one:  
     a) Retire to the Tavern: Gain XP equal to Level Die. Delve ends.  
     b) Stuff of Legend: If Level Die is 10, must Retire and gain 10 XP.  
     c) Seek Glory: Increase Level Die by 1. Dungeon Lord rolls that many Dungeon Dice for the next level. Active Party dice carry over; Graveyard dice remain.  

   - After a delve ends, pass both Party and Dungeon Dice to the left. The Dungeon Lord becomes the new Adventurer, and the next player becomes Dungeon Lord.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Party Dice: Represent your team. Used in phases, then sent to Graveyard. Can be revived via Potions.  
- Dungeon Dice: Represent monsters, loot, and dragons. Rolled per level. Dragon faces go to Dragon’s Lair immediately.  
- Dragon’s Lair: Holds Dragon faces until the dragon is defeated or delve ends. Dice here cannot be rerolled.  
- Hero Abilities:  
  - Specialty: Usable any time, unlimited per delve.  
  - Ultimate: Usable once per delve. Card is turned sideways. Refreshed at start of next delve.  
  - Level Up: When XP meets threshold on Hero card, flip to Master side (automatic, no cost).  
- Treasure Tokens: One-time use abilities, usable at any time during a delve. Return to box after use. Unused ones count as XP (1 each, Town Portal = 2).  
- Twist Cards (optional):  
  - Each player starts with 2 Twist cards; draws 1 at end of each delve round.  
  - Can be played on anyone’s turn, before fighting monsters.  
  - Examples:  
    - Trick of the Light: Reroll one Dungeon die  
    - Doppelganger: Reroll one Party die  
    - Lucky Charm: Reroll any one Dungeon or Party die  
    - Transmutation Spell: Change non-Dragon Dungeon die to Chest  
    - Dragon Call: Change non-Dragon Dungeon die to Dragon, place in Lair  
    - Polymorph Spell: Change to Goblin  
    - Dissolve Spell: Change to Ooze  
    - Final Ingredient: Change to Potion  
    - Undeath Spell: Change to Skeleton  
    - Scatter in Fear: Choose face; reroll all non-Dragon Dungeon dice showing it  
    - Party Time: Choose face; reroll all Party dice showing it  
    - Distractions: Champion dice treated as Thieves for this level  
    - I Am Legend: Change one Party die to Champion  
    - Tough as Nails: Change to Fighter  
    - What Sorcery: Change to Mage  
    - Divine Calling: Change to Cleric  
    - Get Backup: Change to Scroll  
    - Criminal Past: Change to Thief  
    - Wary Dragon: Next Dragon requires only 2 dice to attract  
    - Sleeping Dragon: Next Dragon requires 4 dice to attract  
  - After playing, discard the Twist card.  
  - Advanced: Players may trade Twist cards and treasures.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after each player has completed 3 delves.  
- Final Score =  
  - XP from retiring, defeating dragons, and Stuff of Legend  
  - +1 XP per unused Treasure token (Town Portal = 2 XP)  
  - +2 XP per pair of Dragon Scales  
- Highest score wins.  
- Tiebreakers:  
  1. Fewer Treasure tokens  
  2. Shared victory if still tied  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can you use a Companion treasure (e.g., Vorpal Sword) to quaff a Potion?  
  Yes. It acts as a Party die and can perform any die function, including quaffing.  
- Can a Scroll treasure quaff a Potion?  
  Yes. “Use as one Scroll” means it functions as a Party die.  
- Does an Elixir (Potion treasure token) need a die to be used?  
  No. Elixirs are effects, not potions to quaff. They revive a die directly.  
- Can you use Dragon Bait on someone else’s turn?  
  No. Ruling changed: only usable on your own turn.  
- Do you level up immediately upon reaching XP threshold?  
  Yes. Flip Hero card immediately. Ultimate ability is not refreshed until next delve.  
- Can you use the Scout’s Ultimate to avoid the Dragon?  
  No. Monster Phase (where Ultimate is used) comes before Dragon Phase.  
- Can you Seek Glory with no active Party dice?  
  Yes. Hero can continue alone.  
- Does Ring of Invisibility count as defeating the Dragon?  
  No. No XP or Treasure gained.
