## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
A Brief History of the World is played over six historical epochs. In each epoch, players lead empires, expanding their control across lands, building monuments and forts, and earning gold. The goal is to accumulate the most gold by the end of the sixth epoch through controlling capitals, cities, monuments, and lands, and by earning bonus tokens.

2. Components  
- World game board divided into lands, oceans, and sea areas, with color-coded regions.  
- Eight white barren lands.  
- Area circles (spirally arranged from Northern Europe to South America) indicating regional values.  
- Gold track around the board edge for tracking gold.  
- Colored armies and matching gold markers for each player (3–6 players).  
- Double-sided counters: capitals (green) and cities (blue).  
- Monuments, forts, and fleets.  
- Six dice for resolving invasions.  
- Epoch chart for organizing game elements.  
- Area value tiles (1–3, or 0 if absent).  
- Empire cards (one per player per epoch).  
- Event cards (including Leader, Weaponry, Kingdoms, Minor Empires).  
- Bonus tokens.  
- Array (player aid board) with Invasion dial (0 to +3).  

3. Setup  
1. Place board in center, Epoch chart beside it.  
2. Place capitals, cities, monuments, and fleets on the North Pole supply area.  
3. Each player chooses a color, takes matching armies and gold marker. Armies start in supply.  
4. Randomly determine starting player; place gold markers on Gold track in clockwise order (1st, 2nd, etc.).  
5. Each player receives one Leader and one Weaponry Event card; all others are removed from the game.  
6. Set up Epoch chart:  
   - Area values placed face down by epoch.  
   - Empire and Event cards sorted by epoch, shuffled, and one set per player placed face down.  
   - Bonus tokens shuffled and three placed face down on each Bonus token space.  
   - Cards and tokens remain hidden until used.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each epoch has three phases:  
1. **Organisation and Allocation**  
   - Reveal Area values: place face-up on Area circles; discard previous ones.  
   - Simultaneously distribute Empire and Event cards:  
     - Last-place player (least gold) chooses first from Empire cards, passes remainder.  
     - First-place player (most gold) chooses first from Event cards, passes remainder.  
     - Selection is simultaneous; cards remain hidden until played.  

2. **Empire Turns**  
   - Seven empires are called in fixed order per epoch (see Player Aid).  
   - Any player holding the called Empire card must declare and play that turn.  
   - Each turn has four steps:  
     a. **Establishing the Empire**  
        - Use Array with Invasion dial at 0.  
        - Place armies from supply to Array as specified.  
        - Place one standing army in start-land.  
        - Remove any prior pieces (armies, capitals, cities, monuments, forts).  
        - Add capital if specified.  
        - Place fleets in listed oceans/seas (ocean fleets usable in adjacent seas).  
        - Note special Feature (if any).  

     b. **Expanding the Empire**  
        - Active armies (standing) can expand to adjacent lands (including via straits).  
        - Expansion types:  
          - Into empty land.  
          - Invasion: into enemy-occupied land.  
          - Surrender: into own resigned (lying) army.  
        - Only one army per land; no placement in barren lands (except via Barbarian Event).  

     c. **Invasion Rules**  
        - Attacker rolls first, then defender.  
        - Attacker: usually 2 dice; -1 die if using fleet.  
        - Defender: 1 die; 2 dice if in fort.  
        - Only highest die counts for each.  
        - Invasions points = attacker’s die – defender’s die (if positive).  
        - To defeat defender:  
          - 1 point in clear land.  
          - 2 points in mountain/forest.  
        - If failed: attacker may continue by removing an army from Array and increasing Invasion dial by +1 (max +3).  
        - If successful, dial resets to 0.  
        - Abandoning invasion resets dial to 0.  

     d. **Overruns**  
        - After successful invasion, unused invasion points may capture adjacent lands.  
        - Conditions:  
          - Must belong to same defending player.  
          - Must be adjacent to last captured land.  
          - Must not contain a fort.  
        - Cost: 1 point (clear), 2 points (mountain/forest).  
        - No dice rolled; defender’s army removed.  
        - Fleets cannot support overruns.  

     e. **Surrender**  
        - Place active army on own resigned army; no roll; remove resigned army.  

     f. **Reduction (Degradation)**  
        - When taking control of a land:  
          - Capital → replaced with city.  
          - City → removed.  
          - Monument → removed.  
          - If both capital/city and monument: only capital/city reduced.  
          - Fort always removed.  
        - Applies on invasion and surrender.  
        - **Barbarian empires** (no starting capital) earn 1 gold per reduction.  

     g. **Building Forts**  
        - Spend one army from Array to build a fort in any land with active army.  
        - Unlimited per turn; one fort per land.  
        - Forts not convertible back to armies.  

     h. **Building Monuments**  
        - For every second resource symbol (yellow X) controlled by active armies, build one monument.  
        - Must place in land with:  
          1. Capital (priority)  
          2. City  
          3. Resource symbol  
        - One monument per land.  

     i. **Empire Features**  
        - Use special ability if listed (e.g., Fear, Atlantic crossing limit).  

     j. **Playing Event Cards**  
        - May play any number, but only one active at a time.  
        - Cost gold as shown; move gold marker backward.  
        - Discard after use (except continuous ones like Leader).  
        - Cannot play after invasion dice roll or during overruns.  
        - Red-epoch cards: must play at start of turn, before establishing empire; else discard.  
        - Black-epoch cards: play anytime during turn, current or later epochs.  
        - Armies from Events come from supply, not Array.  

     k. **Reorganising the Empire**  
        - After all Array armies used:  
          - Remove all fleets.  
          - Lay down all standing armies (resign).  
          - Discard Empire card.  

     l. **Collecting Gold**  
        - **Barbarian reduction**: 1 gold per reduction (immediate).  
        - **Capitals, Cities, Monuments**:  
          - 2 gold per capital.  
          - 1 gold per city.  
          - 1 gold per monument.  
        - **Land Control (by Area)**:  
          - Presence (≥1 army): 1× Area value.  
          - Dominance (≥2 armies, more than any other): 2× Area value.  
          - Mastery (≥3 armies, sole control): 3× Area value.  
        - Follow spiral from Northern Europe to South America.  
        - Move gold marker; stack if space occupied.  
        - Over 100? Continue around track.  

3. **Conclusion**  
   - **Gold Track Adjustment**:  
     - For any stacked gold markers, move top marker(s) forward to next empty space, starting from lowest-numbered space.  
   - **Bonus Tokens**:  
     - Player with most gold takes 3 tokens, keeps one, gives two to second place.  
     - Second chooses one, gives last to third.  
     - Tokens kept face down until game end.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Invasion Dial**: Tracks +1 to +3 bonus for continued invasions.  
- **Area Values**: Change per epoch; determine land income.  
- **Empire Order**: Fixed per epoch; skipped if no player has card.  
- **Barbarian Mechanic**: Empires without starting capital earn gold on reduction.  
- **Event Card Timing**: Red = must play at turn start; black = flexible.  
- **Two-Player Variant**: Each player controls two colors; armies of same player can surrender to each other; highest combined gold wins.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after Bonus tokens awarded in Epoch 6.  
- Reveal all Bonus tokens; add values to gold totals.  
- Player with most gold wins.  
- Ties remain unresolved.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Simultaneous Card Selection**: In 3/5-player games, middle player picks one type first, then the other.  
- **Event Cards and Surrender**: Armies from Events are resigned after Event resolves.  
- **Overrun Limitations**: Cannot cross seas; forts block; must be same defender.  
- **Monument Priority**: Build where capital > city > resource.  
- **Fleet Use**: Only for invasion adjacency; not for overruns.  
- **Civil War & Minor Empires**: Use Array, allow overruns, monument/fort building.  
- **Israel Event Card**: Only Kingdom playable in later epochs; must be played at turn start.  
- **Vikings**: Only one Atlantic crossing per turn; sea invasion requires 5 or 6 for automatic success.  
- **France**: Monuments not reduced on invasion or in Gaul.  
- **United States**: Cannot expand from influence areas unless Astronomy card played.  
- **Assyrians/Huns/Mongols (Fear)**: +1 invasion point after successful invasion.
