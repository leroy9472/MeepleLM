## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Mystery Rummy: Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde*, players take on the roles of investigators piecing together evidence in the world of Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic tale. The dual nature of man—represented by Dr. Jekyll (good) and Mr. Hyde (evil)—is central to gameplay through the Dual Identity Card.

**Objective**: Be the first player to reach 100 or more points across multiple hands. Points are scored by playing melds of Evidence cards, laying off cards on existing melds, and playing point-valued Gavel cards. The game ends when a player reaches 100+ points, and the player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, an additional hand is played.

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose a dealer.
2. Remove the **Dual Identity Card** and place it in the center with **Dr. Jekyll face up**.
3. Shuffle the remaining deck.
4. Deal **10 cards face down** to each player, one at a time.
5. Place the remainder of the deck face down to the right of the Dual Identity Card—this is the **Case File** (draw pile).
6. Turn over the top card of the Case File and place it face up to the right—this is **London** (discard pile). Only the top card is visible.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds counter-clockwise, starting with the non-dealer. Each turn follows this sequence:

1. **DRAW ONE CARD** (mandatory)  
   - Draw either:
     - The top card of the **Case File** (face-down draw pile), **or**
     - The top card of **London** (face-up discard pile).

2. **PLAY CARDS** (optional)  
   - Play any number of **Evidence cards**, but **only one Gavel card per turn**.
   - Cards may be played in any order.
   - Even if no cards are played, the player must still draw and discard.

3. **DISCARD ONE CARD** (mandatory)  
   - Discard one card face up to **London**.
   - This applies even when going out (playing your last card).
   - The top card of London is the only visible card.
   - Players may not look through London unless a card effect allows it.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Evidence Cards  
- Identified by a **magnifying glass** in the upper-left corner.
- Can be played as:
  - **Melds**: A group of **three or more** Evidence cards of the **same color/name**.
    - To play a new meld, it must **match the current face of the Dual Identity Card**:
      - If **Dr. Jekyll** is face up: only **J** or **J/H** melds may be played.
      - If **Mr. Hyde** is face up: only **H** or **J/H** melds may be played.
    - J/H cards count as J or H for melding and shut-outs, but **never double in value**.
  - **Lay-offs**: A single Evidence card added to an existing meld (yours or opponent's).
    - May be played **regardless of current Identity**.
    - When laying off on an opponent’s meld:
      - The card counts as the **letter printed on it**, not the current state of the meld.
      - Example: Laying off a card on a *Hyde Awakes* meld counts as an **H** card, even if the meld was transformed from J to H.
    - Lay-offs on your own meld are added directly to the group.
    - A **Transformation card** affects all cards in a meld it rests upon, including prior lay-offs—but not future ones.

#### Gavel Cards  
- Identified by a **gavel and circle** in the upper-left corner.
- Only **one Gavel card may be played per turn**.
- Types:
  - **Potion (×5)**:
    - No point value.
    - Play it to **London** to **flip the Dual Identity Card** (Jekyll ↔ Hyde).
    - After playing, **draw two cards** from the top of the Case File.
    - Cannot be used if merely discarded at end of turn.
  - **Work in Lab (×6)**:
    - Worth **1 point**.
    - Play it in your play area.
    - Then choose **one**:
    - **Examine Case File**: Turn over top 3 cards; take one that matches current Identity (J, H, or J/H). If none match, take none. Return unclaimed cards to London.
    - **Search London**: Look through discard pile; take one card matching current Identity. Show it to opponent. Cannot play another Gavel card this turn.
  - **Transformation (×1)**:
    - Worth **5 points**.
    - Play it **on top of a meld or lay-off** (yours or opponent’s).
    - Changes all cards it rests on from **J ↔ H**.
    - Does **not** affect:
      - J/H cards.
      - Future lay-offs added after the Transformation card is played.
    - Does **not** flip the Dual Identity Card.
    - If still in hand when hand ends, **deduct 5 points** from your score.

#### London (Discard Pile)  
- Only the **top card** is visible.
- Players may not look through it unless a card effect (e.g., *Work in Lab*) allows.

#### Case File (Draw Pile)  
- When the last card is drawn:
  - **First time**: Immediately shuffle **London** (excluding top card, if in use) and turn it face down to form a new Case File.
  - **Second time**: After the last card is drawn, the hand ends immediately. **No points are scored** by either player.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End of Hand Triggers  
- A player discards their **last card** (goes out).
- The **Case File is exhausted a second time** (no new draw pile formed). In this case, **no points are scored**.

#### Scoring Steps  

**1. Determine Shut-Out**  
- A **shut-out** occurs if:
  - The player who went out has **only cards matching the current Identity** in their play area.
    - i.e., all **J** cards when Jekyll is up, or all **H** when Hyde is up.
    - **J/H cards** count toward shut-out eligibility.
- If shut-out achieved:
  - The player who went out **scores normally**.
  - The opponent **scores 0**.

**2. Normal Scoring**  
- For each player:
  1. **Score cards on table**:
     - Add point values of all played cards.
     - **Double** the value of cards that match the current Identity (J or H), **unless**:
        - The card is **J/H** (never doubles).
        - The meld has been **transformed** (e.g., a J meld turned to H via Transformation card—now counts as H, so doesn’t double if Jekyll is up).
  2. **Subtract hand cards**:
     - Sum point values of cards **left in hand**.
     - Deduct from table score.
     - **Exception**: If shut-out, opponent scores **0**, regardless of hand or table.
  3. **Apply Transformation penalty**:
     - If a player holds the **Transformation card** unplayed when hand ends: **deduct 5 points**.

**3. Total and Record**  
- Add final score for the hand.
- Game continues until one or more players reach **100+ points**.
- The player with the **highest score** wins.
- In case of a tie: play **one additional hand**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

- **Can I play a Gavel card and then use its effect even if I don’t play any Evidence cards?**  
  Yes. Playing a Gavel card is optional, but if played, its effect must be resolved.

- **Can I lay off a card on an opponent’s transformed meld?**  
  Yes. The lay-off card counts as its **printed letter** (J or H), not the current Identity.

- **Does the Transformation card affect J/H cards?**  
  No. J/H cards are unaffected by Transformation.

- **Can I play a lay-off under a Transformation card?**  
  No. Lay-offs must be added to the group, but **not under** the Transformation card.

- **What happens if I play Work in Lab and no matching card is available?**  
  - In **Examine Case File**: If none of the top 3 match current Identity, take none. Return all to London.
  - In **Search London**: If no matching card, you still must choose one? No—only take one if available. But the rules imply you must take one if possible. If none match, you proceed without drawing.

- **Can I play a J/H meld at any time?**  
  Yes. J/H melds can be played regardless of current Identity.

- **Do I have to take a card when using Work in Lab?**  
  Yes, **if a matching card is available**. If not, you take none and continue.

- **Can I look at London at any time?**  
  No. Only when a card effect (e.g., *Search London*) allows.
