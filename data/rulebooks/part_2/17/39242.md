## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Black Friday*, players simulate high-stakes market manipulation on Wall Street. Starting with minimal capital, players buy and sell shares in five companies (yellow, blue, red, green, orange), manipulate stock prices, and convert profits into silver and gold. The government offers subsidies (with interest) to keep players afloat. The ultimate goal is to accumulate the most gold by the end of the game, when silver reaches $100.

**Objective**: Be the player with the most gold at game end. Tiebreakers: most silver, then most cash.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Level Card  
Each level card shows:  
- **Top**: Subsidy limit (max total subsidies a player can hold)  
- **Middle**: Purchase limits:  
  - Left number: max shares to buy/sell per turn  
  - Right number: max silver bars to buy per turn  
- **Bottom**: Number of briefcases drawn from bag during price adjustment  

#### Actions  

**1. Buy Shares**  
- Pay current market price per share to bank.  
- Take purchased shares from market and place behind screen.  
- Take **one** briefcase from market:  
  - If possible, must match **any color purchased**  
  - If not, any color  
- Place it on **Stock Purchase Table**.  
- **Effects**:  
  - If this is the **third briefcase** of that color on the table → move that color’s stock marker **1 space right**.  
  - If **last briefcase** of that color was removed from market → move that color’s marker **1 space right**.  

**2. Sell Shares**  
- Sell any number of owned shares (up to purchase limit).  
- Receive cash from bank at current price per share.  
- Place sold shares into market.  
- **Choose one** color sold → move its stock marker **1 space left** (cannot go below **4**).  
- Take **one** briefcase from **current Sales Table**:  
  - Must match **any color sold** if possible; else any color  
- Place it into market.  

**3. Buy Silver**  
- Buy up to silver purchase limit.  
- Pay bank: current silver price × number bought.  
- Take silver bars.  
- **Immediately exchange 5 silver → 1 gold** when possible.  
- Move silver buys marker forward by number purchased.  
- Take **one** briefcase from market (any color) → place on **Silver Purchase Table**.  
- **Effects**:  
  - If third of that color on table → move that color’s stock marker **1 space right**.  
  - If last of that color in market → move its marker **1 space right**.  

**4. Pass**  
- Take **one** briefcase from market (any color) → place on **Silver Purchase Table**.  
- Same effects apply as in Buy Silver (third case or scarcity).  

#### Subsidies  
- Can take at any time during turn.  
- Each subsidy gives **$20**.  
- Subsidy cards:  
  - 1 = $20, $1 interest  
  - 2 = $40, $2 interest  
  - 5 = $100, $5 interest  
- Can "make change" (e.g., 3 subsidies = 2 + 1).  
- **Cannot exceed subsidy limit**.  
- **Interest**: $1 per subsidy at each price adjustment.  

#### Special Action Cards (Use Once Per Game)  
- **Pass**: At any point, move 1 briefcase from market to Silver Purchase Table (can trigger price adjustment).  
- **Sell +1**: When selling shares, sell 1 more than limit.  
- **Buy Silver +1**: When buying silver, buy 1 more than limit.  
- **Buy +1**: When buying shares, buy 1 more than limit.  

Only **Pass** special action adds to a purchase table. Others only increase quantity.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Price Adjustment Trigger  
Occurs **immediately** when:  
- **Stock or Silver Purchase Table** has **5** colored briefcases (6 in 5-player game)  
- **Current Sales Table** has **5** colored briefcases remaining (4 in 5-player game)  

**Player who triggered** the adjustment performs all steps.

#### Price Adjustment Steps  
1. **Pay Interest**  
   - Each player pays $1 per subsidy to bank.  
   - If unable: flip subsidy cards face-down.  
   - Must pay off **next turn** by taking subsidies or selling shares.  
   - If still cannot pay: **bankrupt**, removed from game.  

2. **Draw Briefcases**  
   - Draw number shown on **bottom of level card** from bag.  

3. **Adjust Silver Price**  
   - Increase silver price:  
     - **+1 per 3 silver buys** (rounded down)  
     - **+1 per black briefcase drawn**  
   - Reset silver buys marker to **0**.  
   - **If exactly 1 black drawn**:  
     - Increase silver by 1  
     - Return black briefcase to bag  
     - Do **not** subtract from color counts  

4. **Adjust Stock Prices**  
   - For each color:  
     - Net = (# of that color drawn) – (# of black drawn)  
     - **Exception**: if exactly 1 black drawn → treat as 0 black (no subtraction)  
   - Move stock marker per WSJ chart:  
     - Net +1 → up 1  
     - Net +2 → up 2  
     - Net +3 → up 2, right 1  
     - Net +4 → up 2, right 2  
     - Net 0 → left 1  
     - Net –1 → down 1  
     - Net –2 → down 1, left 1  
   - **Edge Rules**:  
     - At right edge → move **up** instead of right  
     - At left edge → move **down** instead of left (but never below **4**)  

5. **Refill Bag & Market**  
   - Place **drawn colored briefcases** into market.  
   - **Black briefcases drawn**:  
     - 1 black → return to bag  
     - 2+ black → set aside (used later to refill Sales Table)  
   - **If Purchase Table triggered**:  
     - All briefcases from that table → bag  
   - **If Sales Table triggered**:  
     - All remaining briefcases (colored + black) → bag  
     - Advance to next Sales Table (1 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 2...)  
     - After Table 3 cleared → refill **Table 2** with 2 of each color + 2 black from supply  

6. **Scarcity Check**  
   - If **any color missing from market** → move its stock marker **1 space up**.  

7. **Level Check**  
   - If **highest stock value** is in a higher level band than current level card → flip to that level.  
   - **Add 1 black briefcase to bag per level advanced** (including skipped levels).  
   - Level never decreases.  

8. **Game End Check**  
   - If **silver price ≥ 100** → game ends.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: What happens if I can’t pay interest?**  
A: Flip subsidy cards face-down. Must pay on next turn via new subsidies or selling shares. If impossible → bankrupt, removed.

**Q: Can I use multiple special actions?**  
A: No. Only one special action per game, even if you hold multiple cards.

**Q: Does passing avoid price adjustment?**  
A: Yes. Clever players pass to avoid triggering adjustment and let next player deal with it.

**Q: When do stock prices go up during normal play?**  
A: Two cases:  
- Third briefcase of a color on **any purchase table** → +1 right  
- Last briefcase of a color removed from market → +1 right  

**Q: What happens when a level is skipped?**  
A: Flip to highest reached level. Add **one black briefcase per level skipped** (e.g., from 2 to 5 → add 3 blacks to bag).

**Q: Can stock price go below 4?**  
A: No. Minimum is 4.

**Q: Can silver price go above 100?**  
A: No. It stops at 100.

**Q: Do black briefcases count toward price adjustment triggers?**  
A: No. Only **colored** briefcases count for trigger conditions.
