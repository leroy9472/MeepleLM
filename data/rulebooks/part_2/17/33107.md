## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Senji is set in feudal Japan, where the aging emperor’s weakening family has left the powerful office of shogun vacant. Each player takes on the role of a daimyo (feudal lord) vying for supremacy. Victory is achieved by being the first to reach or exceed 60 honor points and having the highest score at the end of a game turn. Players earn honor through military victories, economic card combinations, and diplomatic maneuvers. Alliances are vital but temporary—betrayal and strategic sacrifice are part of the path to becoming shogun.

### 2. Components  
- Game board: Map of Japan with 18 provinces and a score track around the perimeter  
- 36 fortress figures (6 per family)

### 4. Gameplay Flow

2. **Winter Phase (Diplomacy)**  
3. **Spring Phase (Order Programming)**  
4. **Summer Phase (Resolution of Orders)**  
5. **Autumn Phase (Trading / Recruitment / Honor)**  

Repeat until a player reaches or exceeds 60 honor points at the end of a turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Welcoming the Emperor  
- At start of each turn, the player with the highest honor hosts the emperor  
- First turn: highest honor wins; tie broken by destiny dice  
- Subsequent turns: if tied, current host chooses among tied players  
- Host gains:  
  - Decides order of province/fleet activation in Summer  
  - Decides play order in Autumn  
  - Controls hourglass during Winter  

#### Winter Phase (Diplomacy)  
- 4-minute negotiation period (hourglass monitored by host)  
- Players may:  
  - Trade diplomacy cards (any type, any family)  
  - Make verbal agreements (unenforceable)  
  - Exchange cards face up or face down  
- **Diplomacy Card Types:**  
  - **Family Member Cards:** Represent hostages  
    - Can be executed during combat: attacker loses 2× card value; defender gains card value  
    - Can be revealed in Autumn: gain card value in honor (max 1 per opposing family); lose points if card returned to hand  
  - **Military Support Cards:** Used in combat  
    - Play card to gain support from another family  
    - Gain up to card’s value in combat points from dice showing that family’s symbol  
    - Cannot use opponent’s card against them  
    - Cannot trade own dummy card (value 0)  
  - **Trading Cards:** Used in Autumn  
    - Return to owner to draw X hanafuda cards and choose 1 (X = card value)  
- **Missing Families (3–5 players):**  
  - 2 diplomacy cards per missing family revealed  
  - Players bid using their own diplomacy cards placed face down  
  - Highest total bid wins the card  
  - Winner shuffles bid cards into the missing family’s deck  
  - Tied bids remain for next Winter  
  - Losers retrieve cards  
  - When a missing family’s card is played, return it to its deck  

#### Spring Phase (Order Programming)  
- Simultaneously, each player places one order token face down on each controlled province  
- **Order Types:**  
  - **Production:** Draw 2 hanafuda cards  
  - **Recruitment:** Gain 2 military units (max 6 per province; max 12 per player)  
  - **Movement:** Move units to adjacent province or sea  
    - Ground movement: to adjacent land  
    - Sea movement: to adjacent sea zone (units combine into fleet)  
    - Sea raid: move via sea and disembark same turn into adjacent land  
      - Roll 1 die per military unit; lose unit for each die showing your family symbol  
- Fleets:  
  - No naval combat  
  - Multiple families may share a sea zone  
  - Limit: 6 military units per fleet (samurai do not count)  
  - Fleets must be activated in Summer  

#### Summer Phase (Resolution of Orders)  
- Host activates provinces and fleets one by one in any order  
- When activated, reveal order and resolve immediately  

**Production:** Draw 2 hanafuda cards  
**Recruitment:** Add 2 military units (subject to limits)  
**Movement:**  
- Move units as specified  
- Fleets: choose to leave, move to adjacent sea, or disembark into adjacent land  

**Combat:**  
- Triggered when units enter enemy-controlled province  
- Cannot attack if controlling 6 provinces  
- **Combat Value Calculation:**  
  1. 1 point per military unit  
  2. 1 die per samurai, set to family symbol (not rolled) = +1 point  
  3. Roll remaining dice; each die showing your symbol = +1 point  
  4. Each player plays 1 military support card (own dummy or another family’s)  
     - Gain combat points = number of supporting family’s symbols rolled, up to card’s value  
     - If both seek same family’s support, higher-value card wins  
     - Return cards to owners after use  
- Defender uses samurai abilities first, then attacker  
- Highest total wins  
- **Tie:** New combat round (reroll dice, replay cards)  
- **Loser:** Loses all military units and samurai in combat  
- **Winner:**  
  - Loses military units equal to loser’s loss (samurai survive)  
  - Gains honor points:  
    - If attacker: 2 × total units lost by both sides  
    - If defender: 1 × total units lost by both sides  
  - Captures province: replace fortress; discard order token if present  

#### Autumn Phase (Trading / Recruitment / Honor)  
- Host selects players one by one to act (designer variant: play in honor order, highest first)  
- Each player may perform any number of actions in any order:  
  - **Use Trading Card:** Return to owner; look at X hanafuda cards, choose 1  
  - **Score Diplomatic Honor:** Return 1 diplomacy card from each other family (any type) → gain 10 honor; each other player loses 1 honor  
  - **Discard Hanafuda Sets:** Score honor or hire samurai based on combinations (see player aid)  
  - **Reveal Hostage:** Show 1 family member card per opposing family → gain card’s honor value (temporary)  
  - **Return Hostage to Hand:** Lose corresponding honor points  
  - **Hire Mercenaries (if no provinces or occupied seas):**  
    - Military units: up to 6, 3 honor each  
    - Samurai: pay 6 honor, draw 3, choose 1  
    - Place in any sea zone  
  - **Order Seppuku:** Sacrifice a samurai to use their kami power later  

#### Samurai & Kami  
- Samurai who die (combat or seppuku) become kami  
- Kami power may be used once later in the game:  
  - **Diplomatic Kami (Blue):** Take 1 diplomacy card (not dummy) from another player’s hand  
  - **Economic Kami (Green):** Take 1 hanafuda card from the deck  
  - **Military Kami (Red):** Reroll any dice in a combat (once per combat)
