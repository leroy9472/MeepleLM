## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
WildLife is a strategic board game of evolution, adaptation, and competition. Players control unique organisms striving to dominate diverse terrains through migration, expansion, and attack. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by controlling areas, building large herds, mastering adaptations, and managing resources effectively.

### 3. Setup  

#### Board Setup  
- Sort Ability tiles by type and place them beside the board.  
- Place the purple Scoring Pawn on the dot to the left of the Big Scoring Track.  
- Place all 11 white pawns on the Small Scoring Track.  
- Shuffle all WildLife cards into a single face-down draw deck.  

#### Player Setup  
- Each player selects an Organism board at random (or via auction in 2P variant).  
- Take matching organism pawn and:  
  - 2–3 players: 30 tiles  
  - 4 players: 25 tiles  
  - 5 players: 21 tiles  
  - 6 players: 18 tiles  
- Each player receives 8 food tokens and is dealt 10 WildLife cards.  
- Remaining cards form the draw deck.  
- Place Ability tiles on player boards as indicated per terrain.  

#### Starting Player & Scoring Markers  
- The player with the oldest organism (indicated on board) starts.  
- Players place VP markers on the scoring track in clockwise order: first player on 1, next on 2, etc.  

#### Seeding the Board  
- Players place starting organisms in clockwise order beginning with the start player.  
- Number of starting tiles per player:  
  - 2P: 12 each  
  - 3P: 8 each  
  - 4P: 5 each  
  - 5P: 4 each  
  - 6P: 3 each  
- Placement rules:  
  - Must place in a terrain where the organism has Migrate, Expand, or Attack adaptation  
  - Cannot place in organism’s "no action" terrain  
  - One tile per space  
  - Max 2 tiles per player in small areas (4–5 spaces)  
  - Max 4 tiles per player in large areas (8–9 spaces)

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, perform the following in any order:  
1. **Play and/or auction up to 3 WildLife cards** — must auction at least 1 card  
2. **Use owned Ability cards** (once per turn, Defense only usable on others’ turns)  
3. **Perform 1 free Migration**  
4. **Convert food to VP**: spend 3 food → 1 VP (only on your turn)  
5. **Discard un-auctioned played cards**, then draw to refill hand to 10 cards

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Adaptations (Hierarchy)  
From weakest to strongest:  
- Migrate → Expand → Attack  
- Stronger adaptations allow weaker actions  

##### Migrate  
- Move one of your tiles orthogonally to an adjacent empty space  
- Can "jump" over contiguous own tiles if destination is adjacent to any of your tiles  
- Must have Migrate (or higher) adaptation in both source and destination terrain  

##### Expand  
- Place a tile from supply onto an empty space  
- Must have Expand or Attack adaptation in that terrain  

##### Attack  
- Replace an opponent’s tile with one from your supply (return opponent’s tile to box)  
- Requirements:  
  - Have Attack adaptation in that terrain  
  - Area must be full (no empty spaces)  
- Can be blocked by opponent’s Defense ability  

#### Card Actions  
- **Terrain Card**: Perform Migrate, Expand, or Attack in matching terrain based on your adaptation  
- **Adaptation Card**: Improve your adaptation by 1 level in one terrain (Attack is max level)  
- **Ability Card**: Take one Ability tile of your choice  
  - Max 2 of same type  
  - If not available in supply, take from player with highest VP (you choose in case of tie)  
- **Joker Card**: Use as Terrain, Adaptation, or Ability card  
- **Event Card**: Execute immediately:  
  - **Epidemic**: Each opponent removes 1 organism from board (starting left of active player)  
  - **Famine**: Each opponent returns 5 food; if unable, lose 1 VP per missing food  
  - **Food Source**: You gain 7 food; last-place player gains 3. If you are last, gain 10 (2P: you gain 7)  

#### Auction Rules  
- Must auction at least 1 card per turn  
- Bidding starts clockwise from active player  
- Minimum bid: 3 food  
- Active player cannot bid  
- If no one bids, card is discarded  
- Winner pays food to active player and immediately executes card’s action  
- Overbidding allowed: winner may lose VP to gain food (1 VP → 3 food, max 2 VP)  

#### Ability Cards (Use Once Per Turn)  
- **Defense**: Block 1 Attack, Aggression, or Mobility action against you. Aggressor loses the action.  
- **Intelligence**: Play 1 additional card this turn.  
- **Food**: Gain +2 VP (move scoring marker forward 2 spaces).  
- **Aggression**: Perform an Attack in any terrain where you have Attack adaptation, even if area is not full.  
- **Mobility**: Move one of your tiles to any space where you have Migrate (or higher) adaptation. If occupied, switch places with opponent (they need not be adapted to destination).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Small Scoring  
- Triggered when a player fills the last open space in a terrain area (and it hasn’t been scored yet)  
- Place the leftmost white pawn from the Small Scoring Track into the area  
- Active player scores VP equal to the number revealed under the pawn  
- Each area scores only once this way  

#### Big Scoring  
- Triggered when Small Scoring reveals a colored space (positions 4, 8, 11)  
- Resolve after current player’s turn ends  
- Use purple pawn to mark progress on Big Scoring Track  

**Area Majority Scoring**:  
- Full area, single player: +5 VP  
- Single occupant (not full): +4 VP  
- Multiple players:  
  - 1st: +3 VP  
  - 2nd: +2 VP  
  - 3rd: +1 VP  
- Tie: all tied players get points for lower rank; lower rank not awarded  

**Herd Scoring**:  
- Herd = orthogonally connected group of your tiles (no diagonals)  
- Score largest to smallest: 10 / 7 / 5 / 3 / 1 VP  
- Tie: all tied players get points for lower rank; next rank drops  
- Players do not compete against themselves — multiple herds of same size score fully  

**Adaptations, Abilities, and Food**:  
- Most: +4 VP  
- Second most: +2 VP  
- Tie: all tied get lower rank’s points; lower rank not awarded  
- Adaptation count: each level on wheel counts as 1 (e.g., Attack = 3 points)  

#### End Game  
Game ends when:  
- The 11th area is scored (i.e., 11th white pawn placed), OR  
- Any player places their last organism tile  
- Final Big Scoring occurs after the current player finishes their turn  

#### Winning  
- Most VP wins  
- Tiebreaker:  
  1. Most food  
  2. Largest herd (orthogonally connected group)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use Defense more than once per turn?**  
  No — only once per turn, but can be used once against each opponent’s turn.  

- **Can I convert food to VP outside my turn?**  
  No — only during your turn. Unconverted food is worthless at game end.  

- **Can I use Aggression to attack in a non-full area?**  
  Yes — Aggression ability allows Attack even if area is not full.  

- **What happens if I can’t pay food in an auction?**  
  You may overbid; pay by losing VP (1 VP = 3 food, max 2 VP).  

- **Can I score the same area multiple times via Small Scoring?**  
  No — only once per game. Refilling an already-scored area has no effect.  

- **Can I use Intelligence to play more than 4 cards?**  
  Yes — base limit is 3, Intelligence allows +1, so up to 4 cards per turn.  

- **Do I draw cards before or after resolving Big Scoring?**  
  Drawing happens at end of turn, before any scoring. Scoring occurs after turn ends.  

- **Can I migrate into a terrain where I only have Migrate?**  
  Yes — Migrate allows movement into terrain where you have at least Migrate adaptation.
