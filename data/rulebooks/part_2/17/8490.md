## Age of Napoleon 1805-1815 Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Age of Napoleon 1805–1815*, one player controls France under Napoleon I, aiming to dominate continental Europe. The opposing player commands the Coalition, seeking to force Napoleon’s abdication. The game simulates the strategic interplay of military campaigns, diplomacy, and insurrection across Europe from 1805 to 1815.

**Victory Conditions:**
- **Marginal French Victory:** Control or occupation of all countries adjacent to France and either Austria or Russia, while neither Austria nor Russia is a Coalition member, insurgent, or neutral occupied by the Coalition. Additionally, either French forces have invaded Russia in a prior turn or it is 1811 or later.
- **Decisive French Victory:** Control or occupation of Austria, Prussia, Russia, and all countries adjacent to France, with no country (except Britain) being a Coalition member, insurgent, or neutral occupied by the Coalition.
- **Marginal Coalition Victory:** French control reduced to France and no more than three minor countries.
- **Decisive Coalition Victory:** France surrenders or Napoleon’s corps is permanently eliminated.
- **Tie-Breaker:** If no victory is achieved by the end of 1815, the French player wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in yearly turns, each divided into eight phases:
1. **Diplomacy Phase:** Play diplomatic cards to shift country alignments.
2. **Insurrection Phase:** Resolve ongoing insurrections and trigger new ones.
3. **Strategy Phase:** Discard remaining cards, reshuffle if needed, draw new hand (6–10 cards).
4. **Reinforcement Phase:** Deploy new corps, rally spent corps, repatriate prisoners.
5. **Campaign Phase:** Move armies, intercept, withdraw, fight battles over six campaign rounds (last two are winter).
6. **Surrender Phase:** Check surrender conditions in order: minors, Spain, Prussia, Austria, Russia, France.
7. **Winter Attrition Phase:** Roll for attrition in areas with 3+ corps.
8. **Victory Check Phase:** Check for victory conditions.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Movement
- **Movement Allowance (MA):** Equal to army leader’s Movement Rating (MR), modified by:
  - +1 for Forced March card
  - -1 in winter
  - -1 if attacking
  - -1 if Mud card is in effect
- **Movement Rules:**
  - One army moved per campaign round (up to three with Major Campaign card).
  - First move/intercept per campaign phase is free; subsequent moves cost one card discard.
  - Movement stops upon exhausting MA or entering enemy-occupied area.
  - Corps can be picked up or dropped off during movement, provided army leader’s SR is not exceeded.
- **Special Movement:**
  - **Sea Movement (Britannia in effect):** Coalition may move one corps between coastal areas.
  - **Winter Movement:** Land movement between Sverige and Lithuania across frozen Baltic Sea (counts as one area).
  - **Swedish-Danish Movement:** French may only move between Sverige and Danmark if neither is a Coalition member.

#### March Attrition
- **Triggers:** Entering 3rd/4th area, mountain/marsh area, winter, or forced march.
- **Effects:** For each trigger:
  - Roll die, cross-reference with number of *spent* corps on March Attrition Table.
  - Fresh corps become spent; spent corps may be lost.
  - Losses are temporary (to Prisoners Box) except in winter (permanent).
- **Timing:** Applied immediately upon entering area, before battle or withdrawal.

#### Combat
- **Battle Initiation:** When army enters area with enemy army that does not fully withdraw.
- **Battle Resolution:**
  1. **Engagement:** Each side commits up to SR corps (attacker declares first).
  2. **Battle Strength:** Sum of BRs of engaged corps.
     - +1 per corps fighting at home.
     - -2 per corps attacking after sea move.
  3. **Card Play:** Attacker plays battle cards first, then defender. No duplicates.
  4. **Die Roll:** Each side rolls one die, cross-reference with modified battle strength on Battle Results Table to determine losses.
  5. **Victory:** Side inflicting more losses wins. Tiebreaker: roll again with TBM; defender wins if tied.
  6. **Losses:** Half are permanent (removed), half temporary (Prisoners Box). Odd loss is permanent if loser or winner by tiebreaker.
- **Retreat:**
  - **Loser:** Retreats to adjacent enemy-free area.
    - Defender cannot retreat toward attacker’s entry area.
    - Attacker/interceptor must retreat toward entry area.
    - Insurgent corps cannot retreat >1 area from home.
    - One Coalition corps may retreat by sea if Britannia is in effect.
  - **Unable to retreat:** Corps placed in Prisoners Box.
- **Victory Effects:** Winner may discard one card to rally all surviving corps (cannot do so if Pursuit card is played).

#### Diplomacy & Insurrection
- **Diplomacy Cards:** Napoleon I, Talleyrand, Pitt, English Gold, Metternich, Alexander I.
  - Players alternate targeting countries; opponent may counter with opposing card.
  - Countries immune to diplomacy: Britain (French), France (Coalition), insurgent/occupied countries.
- **Insurrection:**
  - **Success:** No French corps in country → becomes Coalition member.
  - **Failure:** >½ areas (incl. capital) occupied by French, no insurgent corps → becomes French Dominion.
  - **Trigger:** Coalition plays Insurrection card in French Dominion or French-occupied neutral.
  - **Tirol:** Automatically becomes insurgent if Austria becomes Coalition member/insurgent.

#### Reinforcement
- **Deployment Limits:** Based on country control (see Player Aid Card 1).
  - Mobilization: Max corps on board.
  - Deployment: Max corps deployable per turn.
- **Deployment Rules:**
  - Must deploy in enemy-free home area.
  - French may deploy in enemy-free insurgent/FD adjacent to enemy-free French area.
  - Coalition may deploy one corps in friendly-controlled coastal area if Britannia is in effect.
- **Rallying:** Discard one card to unspend all corps in one army.
- **Repatriation:** Prisoners return to reserve at end of phase.

#### Special Rules
- **Neutrality Violation:** Occurs if:
  - Corps dropped in neutral country.
  - Move/withdrawal/retreat ends in neutral country.
  - Enter capital of neutral major country.
  - **Exception:** No violation if occupier holds capital.
  - **Effect:** Neutral country joins other side, may deploy corps.
- **Interception:** Enemy army may move into area being entered by moving army if:
  - MR of intercepting leader ≥ MR of moving leader.
  - Costs one card (unless first of turn).
  - Interceptor chooses attack/defend.
- **Withdrawal:** Non-moving army may withdraw if MR ≥ moving army’s MR. Cannot withdraw if already engaged.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Check:** At end of each turn, check conditions.
- **Marginal Victory:** Player may end game immediately or continue for decisive victory.
- **Decisive Victory:** Ends game immediately.
- **1815 Tie:** French player wins.
