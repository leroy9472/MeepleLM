## 30 STREETCAR RAILS — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *30 Streetcar Rails*, players simulate urban rail planning by placing track tiles to connect stations across a grid-based city map. The goal is to create drivable rail connections between stations to score points. This is a solitaire puzzle game inspired by the *Streetcar* board game, using its components in a new way.

**Objective**: Maximize your score by connecting stations with continuous, legal rail routes, passing through fields and junctions to earn bonuses.

### 2. Components  
- 35 track tiles from *Streetcar*  
- Game board (divided into rows and columns, with dice symbols and station positions)  
- 5 streetcar tokens (cars 1–5)  
- 1 six-sided die  
- Pencil and scoring card (for tracking connections and points)  

---

### 3. Setup  

#### Tiles  
- Shuffle all 35 track tiles and place them face down into one or more piles.

#### Stations  
- Place cars 1 to 4 on any dice symbol on the board to mark stations.  
- One station must be placed in each of the four outer rows: top, right, left, and bottom.  
- Each row must contain exactly one station.

#### Pedestrian Zones  
- Roll a six-sided die six times—one for each row (horizontal or vertical, as labeled on the board).  
- For each roll, place one tile face down on the column (or row) corresponding to the die value.  
- If a tile would be placed directly in front of a station, shift it one space inward along the same row/column.  
- After placing all 6 tiles, choose one to remove and return to the tile pile (it remains face down).

#### Central Station  
- Choose any space adjacent to a pedestrian zone tile.  
- Mark it with car 5. This is the central station.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts exactly **30 turns**. On each turn:

1. **Draw**: Take one track tile from the face-down pile.
2. **Roll**: Roll the six-sided die.
3. **Place Tile**:
   - Choose any **empty square** in the **row or column** matching the die result.
   - Place the tile in any orientation.
   - **Note**: Standard *Streetcar* placement rules (e.g., no tracks leading off the edge) **do not apply**.
   - If all spaces in the selected row and column are occupied, place the tile on **any empty space**.
4. **Alternative Action**:
   - Instead of placing the tile as track, you may place it **face down** on any empty space as an **additional pedestrian zone**.
   - This does **not score points**, but may help avoid blocking future useful placements.

Repeat for 30 turns.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Drivable Connection  
A connection between two stations is **drivable** if:
- The route follows continuous track.
- No **right-angle turns** (90°) or sharper.
- No **turning in place** unless the track tile allows it (e.g., curves or junctions).
- Movement must follow the natural flow of the track.

#### Scoring Elements  
For each **pair of stations (1–4)** that are drivably connected:

- **Base Points**: Sum of the two station numbers.  
  (e.g., connecting 2 and 3 → 2+3 = 5 points)
- **Field Bonus**: +1 point for **each field** traveled through on the **shortest path**.  
  - If a field is passed through multiple times, it counts each time.
- **Junction Bonus**: +1 point **each time** the route crosses a **junction** (marked by a **tree symbol** on the tile).

#### Central Station Bonus  
Points awarded based on how many of stations 1–4 are drivably connected to **central station (car 5)**:
- 1 connected → 2 points  
- 2 connected → 6 points  
- 3 connected → 12 points  
- 4 connected → 20 points

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- After 30 turns, the game ends.
- Evaluate all station pairs (1–2, 1–3, 1–4, 2–3, 2–4, 3–4) for drivable connections.
- Score each connection using base + field + junction points.
- Add central station bonus.
- **Total score** = sum of all connection points + central station bonus.
- Higher score wins (in solo play, aim to beat personal bests).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a tile that creates a dead end?**  
  Yes. Unlike *Streetcar*, dead ends are allowed.
- **Can I place a tile that leads off the board?**  
  Yes. Standard *Streetcar* edge rules are suspended.
- **Can pedestrian zones be connected later?**  
  No. Face-down tiles (pedestrian zones) block placement and cannot be traversed.
- **Can I score a connection that loops through multiple junctions?**  
  Yes. Each **passage** over a tree-marked junction earns +1 point.
- **What if a route passes the same junction twice?**  
  Score +1 for each crossing.
- **Must the central station be used in scoring?**  
  No. It only contributes via the bonus for connecting stations 1–4 to it.
