### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game alternates between **Stock Rounds** and **Operating Rounds (OR)**.  
Each full cycle of one Stock Round and one Operating Round constitutes a **Turn**.

#### Stock Round (SR)  
Players act in clockwise order from Priority Deal until all pass consecutively. A player may pass and rejoin later.

**While private companies are available**, a player may:  
1. **Buy the cheapest unsold private company at par value**, or  
2. **Bid on any other unsold private company**, increasing the bid by at least $5 over the previous bid or par value.  
3. **Pass**.

- If a player buys the cheapest private, it may trigger an auction if others wish to outbid.  
- Bids tie up money until auction resolves.  
- If Tuscumbia Railway remains unpurchased at end of round, its price drops $5.  
- Once Tuscumbia’s price reaches $0, the Priority Deal player **must** buy it on their next action.

**Once all privates are sold**, players may:  
a) **Sell stock to the Open Market (O.M.)** — Allowed after the first SR.  
   - Max 50% of a corporation may be in O.M.  
   - Price drops one space per 10% share sold.  
b) **Sell a private company to another player** — Any time, between players.  
c) **Buy one cert** from IPO or O.M., or **buy a private** from another player.  
   - Cannot buy stock you sold in the same round.  
   - Cannot own more than 60% of a corporation.  
   - First share of a corporation must be bought by its President; buyer sets par value (typically 60–105).  
   - Corporation floats when 60% of its shares are out (from IPO or O.M.).  
     - Bank pays corp 10 × par value.  
     - Stock price set at par.  
     - President takes charter and places home station.

**End of Stock Round**:  
1. Any corporation 100% owned has its stock price move up one space.  
2. Priority Deal passes to the player immediately after the last player who took an action.

#### Operating Round (OR)  
Corporations operate in order:  
- **Private companies first** (simultaneously).  
- **Public corporations** in order of stock market value (highest to lowest).  
  - Ties broken from right to left, top to bottom on market.

Each corporation’s turn consists of:

1. **Place home station** (if first operation after floating).  
   - Must be on a legal city or town hex.  

2. **Lay or upgrade track** (optional).  
   - Tile placement follows terrain order: Light Green → Yellow → Green → Brown → Grey.  
   - Must connect to existing network (station or track).  

3. **Place station** (optional).  
   - Must connect to existing station (via continuous track).  
   - One station per turn.  
   - Home station placement does not count against this limit.  

4. **Run trains** (only if demanded by at least one stockholder).  
   - Route must:  
     - Include at least one of the corporation’s stations.  
     - Use each city, town, red (off-map), and track segment only once per train.  
     - May enter but not pass through a blocked city.  
   - Train number = maximum number of cities and reds a train may visit.  
     - Towns are unlimited (do not count against limit).  
   - Revenue = sum of city/town values × train count, with bonuses (e.g., 4D train: 4 cities doubled + bonus + towns).  

5. **Pay or withhold dividends** (mandatory).  
   - **Pay**: 10% of total revenue per share.  
     - Open Market shares: payment goes to corporation.  
     - IPO shares: revenue is lost.  
     - Stock price moves right one space.  
   - **Withhold**: All revenue retained by corporation.  
     - Stock price moves left one space.  

6. **Remove obsolete 4-trains** (mandatory).  
   - Any 4-trains become obsolete and must be discarded to O.M. if newer trains are available.  

7. **Purchase trains** (optional, unless:  
   - Corporation made a legal run but has no trains → **must** buy at least one).  
   - **Train limits**:  
     - One train per corporation per OR until Phase 4.  
     - Phase 4+: unlimited train purchases.  
   - **Sources**:  
     a) From Bank: at face value.  
     b) From another corporation: any negotiated price (on buyer’s turn only).  
   - Trains exceeding limit are discarded to O.M.  
   - **Private companies**:  
     - From Phase 3 onward, corporations may buy private companies from players at 0.5× to 1.5× par value at any point during their OR.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Stock Market Movement**:  
  - Down one space per 10% share sold.  
  - Up one space if corporation is 100% owned.  
  - Up one space if dividends paid.  
  - Down one space if dividends withheld.  
- **Certificate Limits**:  
  - Max 60% ownership per player.  
  - Certs in **Yellow** area do not count toward cert limit.  
  - **Orange** and **Brown** areas: do not count toward limit and allow >60% ownership.  
  - **Brown** area: allows purchasing more than one train per turn (only one from IPO).  
- **Train Phases**:  
  - Train number determines phase.  
  - Phase 4 begins when certain trains are purchased.  
  - 4-trains rust at Phase 5.  
- **Private Companies**:  
  - Can be sold between players.  
  - Can be purchased by corporations (Phase 3+) for 0.5× to 2× face value.  
  - Close at start of Phase 5.  
  - Count toward cert limit.  
- **M&C Train Chits**:  
  - Last for the rest of the game unless the corporation changes President.
