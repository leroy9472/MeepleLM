## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Baltimore & Ohio is a strategic economic simulation game set during the expansion of American railroads in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Market Round**  
Players take actions in Player Order (determined by cards). Actions may be taken in any order until all players pass consecutively.  

Actions:  
- Sell Stock:  
  - May sell any number of shares from any railroads.  
  - At least one player-owned share must remain per railroad.  
  - Sold shares go to Orphan Stocks box.  
  - Receive value per share from bank.  
  - Each railroad with sold shares devalues by one space on Valuation Track (min $34).  
  - Check for presidency change.  

- Buy Stock:  
  - Buy shares from Held Shares or Orphan Stock of one railroad.  
  - Pay:  
    - To Railroad Treasury (Held Stock)  
    - To Bank (Orphan Stock)  
  - Cannot buy shares of a railroad from which you sold shares this round.  
  - Starting a Railroad:  
    - First purchase triggers startup.  
    - Choose initial valuation from range based on current Tech Level.  
    - Place Valuation Counter under any existing counters at that value.  
    - Take Charter; become President.  
    - Place one cube on starting hex and on Net Income Track (0 or less).  
    - Place remaining cubes on Charter.  
    - Unbought shares go to Held Shares on Charter.  
    - Pay Railroad Treasury for all purchased shares.  

- Have Railroad Buy Back Shares:  
  - President may use Railroad Treasury to buy back shares from Orphan Stock.  
  - Pay value per share to bank.  
  - Move shares to Held Shares.  

- RB Expansion: Auction Robber Baron card (from 2nd Market Round onward, once per round).  
  - Start bid at $1+.  
  - Highest bidder pays bank and takes card.  

End of Market Round:  
- Any railroad with shares in Orphan Stocks devalues by one space (min $34).  

**Business Rounds (2 Rounds, identical)**  
Railroads act in order from highest to lowest share value (top-to-bottom in stacks).  

For each railroad:  
1. Scrap Old Capital Equipment:  
   - Remove card(s); place face-down in Scrapped pile.  
   - Railroad Treasury receives scrap value.  

2. Buy New Capital Equipment:  
   - Take top card(s) from Capital Equipment Deck.  
   - Pay Purchase Price from Railroad Treasury.  
   - If new card has higher Tech Level, immediately advance Tech Level Marker.  

3. Build Track OR Take Resource:  
   - Build Track:  
     - Build up to Tech Level number of contiguous hexes.  
     - Must connect to existing network.  
     - Pay hex cost from Railroad Treasury.  
     - Place cube in each hex.  
     - N&W automatically takes NW Coal from built hex.  
     - Cities (except Chicago) limited to one railroad per player (RR/City).  
   - Take Coal / Lumber:  
     - Take one Coal counter (any RR) or Lumber (Maine Lumber) / NW Coal (N&W only) from hex with your cube.  
     - Place on Charter.  

4. Determine Income:  
   - Service Capacity = Sum of Tech Levels on Capital Equipment Cards.  
   - N&W:  
     - TL4: Can service up to 4 NW Coal  
     - TL5+: Can service all 5 NW Coal  
   - Select up to Service Capacity different cities to service (must use full capacity if possible).  
   - Gross Income:  
     - Per city: Based on current Tech Level (values shown per city).  
     - T7 Expansion: New York, Washington, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago get +$10 at Tech 7.  
     - Per Coal counter: +$40 (if RR has any Capital Equipment).  
     - ML Expansion: Lumber = $10 × Tech Level per counter.  
     - N&W: NW Coal = $10 × Tech Level per counter.  
   - Maintenance Cost = Current Maintenance Cost × Number of Capital Equipment Cards.  
   - Net Income = Gross Income – Maintenance Cost.  

5. Determine Profitability:  
   - If Net Income ≤ 0 (Unprofitable):  
     - Devalue shares by two spaces (min $34).  
     - President sacrifices one share to Held Shares (no payment).  
     - Check for presidency change.  
     - If no player owns shares → Receivership:  
       - Bank takes Railroad Treasury.  
       - Move Orphaned Stock to Held Stock.  
       - Scrap Capital Equipment (no pay).  
       - Move Valuation Counter to “Railroads in Receivership” (use B&OE board if Tech ≥6).  
   - If Net Income > 0 (Profitable):  
     - Choose:  
       - Pay Dividends:  
         - Bank pays players 10% of Net Income per share they own.  
         - Railroad Treasury gets amount for shares on Charter.  
         - Bank keeps remainder (Orphaned Stock).  
         - If Net Income > previous round → Increase share value by one space (max $375).  
       - Retain Profits:  
         - Net Income goes to Railroad Treasury.  
         - If Net Income < previous round → Devalue share by one space (min $34).  
   - Rotate Valuation Counter and place at bottom of stack.  

**Robber Baron Income (RB Expansion)**  
- Steel Producers: $8 per railroad in Pittsburgh + $8 per in Wheeling.  
- Coal Magnates (N&W only): $9 per Coal + $9 per NW Coal taken.  
- Railroads in Receivership still count.  

**Player Order**  
After 2nd Business Round:  
- Reorder players from least to most cash.  
- Ties retain previous relative order.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends at the end of the 2nd Business Round if any of:  
- Any railroad stock reaches $375  
- Tech Level reaches 6 (or 7 if T7 Expansion is used)  
- All shares of all railroads are player-owned  

Final Scoring:  
- Each player totals:  
  - Cash on hand  
  - Value of all owned stock (current Valuation Track price)  
- Highest total wins.  
- Tiebreaker: Lower Player Order card wins.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can you sell your last share?  
  A: No. At least one player must own a share of each railroad.  

- Q: When does Tech Level advance?  
  A: Immediately when a higher-level Capital Equipment card is purchased.  

- Q: Can a railroad in Receivership act?  
  A: Yes. It still takes its turn in Business Rounds but cannot buy equipment or build. It can still generate income if it has resources.  

- Q: What happens if a railroad has no Capital Equipment?  
  A: It cannot generate Gross Income from cities, coal, or lumber. Net Income will likely be ≤0, causing devaluation.  

- Q: Can you build through hexes with black lines?  
  A: No. Thick black lines are impassable. Networks must go around.  

- Q: Can NYC build outside NY before completing green cities?  
  A: No. Must connect all five green cities (Utica, Syracuse, Buffalo, NYC, Albany) first.  

- Q: Can other railroads enter PA cities before PA does?  
  A: No. Until PA connects Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, and Philadelphia, no other railroad may enter those cities.
