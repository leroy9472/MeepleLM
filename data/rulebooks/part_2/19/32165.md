### 1. Lore & Objective

Players travel across a tea-producing region to collect and ship tea tiles, aiming to assemble the largest shipments of individual tea varieties. Fresher tea (loaded later) is worth more points, and players earn victory points both from shipping tea and from fulfilling market demand. The game ends when any player reaches 100 victory points. The player with the most points after final scoring wins.

### 2. Components

- **112 Tea Tiles** in four varieties:
  - Black Tea: 21 tiles (11 with 1 half crate, 7 with 2 halves, 3 with 3 halves)
  - Green Tea: 19 tiles (11 with 1 half crate, 7 with 2 halves, 3 with 3 halves)
  - White Tea: 17 tiles (11 with 1 half crate, 7 with 2 halves, 3 with 3 halves)
  - Red Tea: 15 tiles (11 with 1 half crate, 7 with 2 halves, 3 with 3 halves)

- **1 Game Board** featuring:
  - Wharf with scoring track
  - Chute for demand markers
  - Spaces for ships and multiplier strip

- **7 Ships** – used to load and score shipping crates

- **55 Shipping Crates** – 11 per player in 5 colors

- **5 Tea Collectors** – 1 per player, with directional orientation

- **5 Player Screens** – to hide collected tiles and actions

- **10 Action Tiles** – double-sided, used during shipping phase

- **4 Water Tiles** – fill unused ship berths

- **2 Multiplier Strips** – double-sided, selected based on player count

- **4 Demand Markers per Tea Variety** (2 per variety × 4 varieties) – placed on the chute

- **1 Cloth Bag** – for drawing tea tiles

- **1 Set of Rules**

### 3. Setup

1. **Prepare Playing Area**:
   - Punch out and assemble the board, chute, and multiplier strip.
   - Place tea tiles (crate halves) into the bag and mix.
   - Draw tiles one by one and place them to form the region layout (e.g., India, Sri Lanka, China) as shown in the rulebook.
   - Do **not** place tiles on red-square spaces; instead, place a **city marker** on each.

2. **Set Up Wharf**:
   - Insert the **multiplier strip** into the wharf, showing the side matching the number of players.
   - Place **ships** next to each multiplier value (from lowest to highest).
   - Fill unused berths with **water tiles**.
   - Insert the **chute** into the top of the wharf.

3. **Demand Markers**:
   - Shuffle all **8 demand markers** (2 per tea type) and place them randomly into the chute so they can slide down.

4. **Action Tiles**:
   - Place the 10 action tiles face-up next to the board as a supply.

5. **Player Setup**:
   - Each player chooses a color and takes:
     - 1 tea collector
     - 11 shipping crates
     - 1 player screen
   - Place one shipping crate on the **0** space of the scoring track as a score marker.
   - Set player screen in front; keep crates in front, tiles and actions behind.

6. **Starting Player**:
   - Choose a start player. That player takes the bag of tiles.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

Each turn has **three mandatory phases**, in fixed order:

1. **Score Victory Points for Crates on Ships**
2. **Move Tea Collector and Take Tile**
3. **Load Shipping Crates**

After completing all phases, play passes to the player on the left.

---

#### I. Score Victory Points for Crates on Ships

- For each ship with the player’s crates:
  - Multiply the number of crates on that ship by the **multiplier** next to it.
  - Add all such points together.
- Example: 2 crates on a ×3 ship = 6 points; 1 crate on a ×2 ship = 2 points → total 8 points.

#### II. Move Tea Collector and Take Tile

- **Optional Rotation**:
  - Rotate collector **90° left or right** for free.
  - Rotate **180°** for **2 victory points** (may go negative if insufficient points).
- **Movement Rules**:
  - Move only in the direction the collector’s crate is pointing.
  - Move any distance in a straight line.
  - May pass over cities or other collectors, but **pay**:
    - 1 VP per tile passed over
    - 2 VP per city or opponent’s collector passed over
  - Movement must **end on a tile**.
- **Take Tile**:
  - Remove the tile under the collector and place it **behind your screen**.
  - If the tile has **three half-crates**, you may take **one action tile** from supply and place it behind your screen.
- **Refill Tile**:
  - Draw a new tile from the bag and place it in the vacated space.

#### III. Load Shipping Crates

This phase has **four steps**:

##### 1. Lay Out Tea Tiles
- Reveal selected tea tiles behind your screen.
- Combine half-crates into **complete crates** (2 halves = 1 crate).
- All crates in a shipment must be of the **same tea variety**.
- Crates must be **closed** (no open halves).
- Number of tiles used does not matter — only complete crates count.

##### 2. Load Shipping Crates onto the Ship
- **If tea collector is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a city**:
  - You may load **all** complete crates you laid out.
- **If not adjacent to a city**:
  - You may load **one fewer** crate than laid out (minimum 0).
- **Important**: You **cannot** ship if you would load 0 crates (e.g., laid out 1 crate and not adjacent to city).

**Ship Loading Procedure**:
1. Remove the **lowest ship** from the wharf.
2. Return any crates on that ship to their owners.
3. Shift all remaining ships **down one space**.
4. Place the removed ship to the **top** (highest multiplier).
5. Load your shipping crates onto this ship.

**Note**: If you lack enough crates, you may **relocate** your existing crates from other ships to this one.

##### 3. Discard Tea Tiles
- Place used tiles face-up on the **warehouse** (on the wharf).
- If warehouse already has a stack, place the **older stack back into the bag**.

##### 4. Score Bonus Points

**A. Demand Bonus**
- After discarding, take the **lower** demand marker of the tea variety you shipped and place it on **top** of the chute.
- Count how many **other** demand markers lie between the two markers of your tea type.
- This number = **victory points** from demand.

**B. Quantity Bonus**
- If you load **4 or more crates**, gain **1 VP per crate loaded**.
- If you load **3 or fewer**, no bonus.

**Action Tiles (Optional during Load Phase)**
- You may play **up to two** action tiles during this phase.
- You may play one received **this turn**.
- Cannot use the same action twice in one turn.
- Return tile to supply after use.

Available Actions:
- **No Rotting**: Ignore the -1 crate penalty when not adjacent to a city (i.e., load full number laid out).
- **Double Demand Bonus**: Score **twice** the demand points (quantity bonus unaffected).

### 5. Scoring & End Game

**Game End**:
- The game ends **immediately** when a player reaches **100 or more VP** at the **start of their turn** (after scoring crates).
- That player does **not** complete the rest of their turn.

**Final Scoring**:
- All players reveal tiles behind their screens.
- For **each half-crate** on revealed tiles, lose **1 VP**.
- Action tiles are **worthless**.
- Final scores may drop below 100 — game still ends.

**Winner**:
- Player with the **most VP** wins.
- In case of a tie, players **share victory**.

### 6. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can I rotate and move freely?**  
  Yes, but only 90° for free; 180° costs 2 VP (can go negative).

- **Can I move through cities/other collectors?**  
  Yes, but pay 2 VP each for city or opponent collector passed.

- **Can I combine different tiles to form crates?**  
  Yes — e.g., one 3-half tile + three 1-half tiles = two full crates (if same tea).

- **What if no action tiles are left when I take a 3-half tile?**  
  You do **not** receive an action tile.

- **Can I use an action tile I just earned this turn?**  
  Yes, during the Load phase.

- **Can I use the same action twice?**  
  No — even with two identical tiles, you can’t repeat an action in one turn.

- **What if I can’t form a complete crate?**  
  You may still move and score, but cannot ship unless you can load at least one crate.

- **Can I skip loading crates?**  
  Yes — if you choose not to or cannot load any.

- **Do unused shipping crates on ships score every turn?**  
  Yes — any player with crates on ships scores VP at the **start** of their turn.
