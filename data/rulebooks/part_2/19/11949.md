### 1. Lore & Objective
Shifting Sands simulates the North African Campaign from 1940 to 1943. Players control either the Allied or Axis forces, competing for control of strategic locations across North Africa and the Mediterranean. Victory is determined by controlling key spaces, achieving automatic victory conditions, or accumulating sufficient Victory Points (VPs) by the end of the game in Spring 1943.

### 2. Components
- One 22" x 34" map featuring spaces, terrain, ports, forts, and Victory Point (VP) spaces
- 264 5/8" unit counters (divisions and battlegroups)
- 130 1/2" unit counters (battlegroups)
- Two player reference cards
- Two decks of 55 strategy cards (Allied and Axis)
- Two six-sided dice
- Various markers (VP, turn, action round, supply, replacement, etc.)

### 3. Setup
- Place the turn marker on Summer 1940 on the Turn Record Track (TRT).
- Set the VP marker to 10 on the General Records Track (GRT).
- Place replacement and VP markers on the GRT at 0.
- Position six action markers near each player's Action Round Chart.
- Place five Move/Attack markers near the Axis player.
- Set up units per Campaign Game Setup (17.0) on the map.
- Separate each player's strategy cards by year (1940, 1941, 1942) and shuffle each year's deck.
- Draw initial hand: 7 cards for 1940.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Draw Strategy Card Phase**: Discard unwanted cards, then draw up to hand size (7 in 1940, increasing to 10 by 1943).
2. **Action Phase**: Six Action Rounds where players alternate actions (Axis first each round). Each action is either:
   - Play a strategy card for OPS, RD, RP, or Event
   - Take an Automatic Operation (OPS=1)
3. **Attrition Phase**: Eliminate out-of-supply (OOS) units; adjust space control.
4. **Victory Determination Phase**: Check for automatic victory; adjust VP marker.
5. **Replacement Phase**: Spend accumulated RPs to rebuild or recreate units.
6. **Game Turn Phase**: Advance turn marker; repeat unless game has ended.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Strategy Cards
- Cards may be played for:
  - **OPS**: Spend APs equal to OPS value to activate spaces for movement/combat.
  - **RD**: Use RD points (equal to OPS value) to redeploy units through friendly territory.
  - **RP**: Mark RPs on GRT for later use in Replacement Phase.
  - **Event**: Follow card instructions; some are permanent (marked with *).
- Square OPS numbers allow playing both Event and OPS simultaneously.
- Cards with dual decks and fate die mechanics determine card availability.

#### Movement & Activation
- Activate spaces by paying APs = number of nationalities present (exceptions: British/Commonwealth/Minor Allies = 1; US/US-controlled FF = 1; German/Vichy/Iraqi/Egyptian = 1).
- Armor units may move and attack in same round if moving into space with Attack marker.
- Units may not enter enemy-occupied spaces.

#### Combat
- Sequence: Designate combat → Attempt Flank Attack → Determine Combat Strength → Play Combat Cards → Determine DRM → Determine Fire Column → Determine Results.
- Flank Attack: Requires 2+ units, at least one armor, against non-fort/marsh/mountain. Success on DR 4+ (modified by +1 per additional attacking space).
- Fire Column determined by Division Table (if any division present) or Battlegroup Table.
- Column shifts: +1R for armor vs infantry, -1L for infantry vs armor, -1L for OOS, +2R for Rommel (one attack/round, not vs forts or in Near East/East Africa).
- Bold results on Division Table = possible overrun (not in fort/marsh/mountain).
- Overrun: Defender relocates to Alexandria/Cairo (Allied) or El Agheila/Tarhuna (Axis), or nearest friendly supply source. Units unable to trace path are permanently eliminated.

#### Supply
- Units trace supply through friendly spaces to supply sources (SS).
- Allied SS: Port Said, Suez (Tripoli if Allied-controlled; Benghazi/Tobruk after Montgomery).
- Axis SS: Tripoli (Tunis after Torch; Beirut/Baghdad after Unternehmen Irak; Alexandria if Axis-controlled).
- Vichy SS: Beirut; Iraqi SS: Baghdad; Free French (Chad); LRDG (Deep Desert).
- Full Supply: ≤3 spaces from SS. Limited Supply: >3 spaces or via port. OOS: cannot trace.
- OOS units: cost 1 OPS per unit, -1L in combat, no RD, no combat card benefits, eliminated in Attrition Phase.

#### Redeployment (RD)
- RD points = OPS value of RD card.
- Battlegroup: 1 RD point; Division: 3 RD points.
- Through friendly-controlled spaces (land) or ports (sea).
- May RD to/from Reserve Box to SS or supplied same-nationality unit.
- LRDG may RD to/from Deep Desert.

#### Replacements
- RPs spent in Replacement Phase.
- Cost: 1/2 RP per battlegroup step, 1 RP per division step.
- Eliminated units in Replacement Box may be recreated at full strength.
- Some units have restrictions on recreation location (e.g., GDS/AFR Divisions only in Addis Ababa).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### Victory Points
- Change when VP space control changes.
- Axis gains 1 VP if controlling or adjacent to El Alamein.
- Axis gains 1 VP if controlling any East Africa space (from Fall 1941).
- Cards may grant VPs.

#### Automatic Victory
- **Axis**: VP total ≥14 OR control both Port Said and Suez.
- **Allied**: VP total ≤3 OR control Tripoli (pre-Torch) OR control Tunis and Tripoli while Axis does not control Alexandria (post-Torch).

#### Final Victory (Spring 1943)
- Axis Victory: 5+ VPs
- Allied Victory: 4 or fewer VPs

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Combat Cards**: Attacker plays first, then defender. Winning side keeps cards face-up for rest of turn.
- **Disengage**: Defender may play to avoid flank attack; must retreat 2 spaces regardless of combat outcome.
- **Minefields**: Makes clear terrain into marsh; shifts attacker's fire left; prevents overrun; does not prevent flank attack.
- **Stukas at Dawn/Matildas**: Cancel fort effects (no +CF, can overrun, treat as clear for movement), but do not allow flank attacks against forts.
- **OOS Units**: Eliminated in Attrition Phase; divisions permanently removed.
- **Overstacking**: Eliminate excess units at end of movement/RD/retreat; divisions permanently eliminated.
- **Retreats**: Must retreat to friendly spaces if possible; to supplied spaces if possible; cannot end adjacent to original space after 2-space retreat with Disengage.
- **LRDG**: May perform Intelligence Gathering (reveal Axis cards) or Raid (discard random Axis card) once per turn.
