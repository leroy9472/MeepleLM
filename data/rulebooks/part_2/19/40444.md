## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Dr. David Livingstone was a Scottish explorer and missionary who traveled through Africa, notably along the Zambezi River, where he discovered Victoria Falls. In *LivingStone*, players take on the roles of explorers journeying up the Zambezi in a steamboat, seeking gems, placing tents, and earning victory points through exploration and donations to the Crown.

**Objective**: Be the player with the most victory points at the end of the game. Victory points are earned by placing tents, selling gems (via Market card), holding unsold gems, playing science cards, and achieving majorities in rows. However, players who donate the least money to the Queen are eliminated from contention.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this sequence:

#### A. Start of Round  
- The current starting player rolls **all active dice** (2 per player).  
- Dice are sorted in ascending order for visibility.  

#### B. Die Selection Phase  
- Starting with the starting player and proceeding clockwise, each player takes turns selecting one unclaimed die.  
- On a player’s turn:  
  - They must choose a die **higher** than any die they previously took this round.  
  - **Exception**: If they play a *Royal Favor* card, they may take **two dice in succession**, both higher than their last die (if any), and execute both actions.  
- Once no player can or wants to take a die (due to no valid higher die), the phase ends.

#### C. Scoring Phase  
- Score the **column currently under the Steamboat**:  
  - For each tent a player has in that column, they score the row value (shown on left edge).  
  - Multiple tents in same space: each player with a tent there scores full points.  
  - Move Scoring Markers accordingly.  

#### D. Advance Steamboat  
- Move Steamboat **one space forward** to the next column.  
- Next round begins with the next player clockwise rolling all dice.

Repeat until Steamboat exits the board after final column.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions (When Taking a Die)  
After claiming a die, immediately perform **one** of these actions:

- **Draw an Action Card**  
  - Draw 1 card from the Draw Pile.  
  - If *Mine Collapse* is drawn:  
    - Reveal it immediately.  
    - All players return **all unsold gems** to the bag.  
    - Discard pile + remaining deck + Mine Collapse are shuffled into a new Draw Pile.  
    - Draw a replacement card.  
  - Players may hold any number of cards and play multiple on their turn.

- **Take Coins**  
  - Gain coins totaling the die value (e.g., die shows 4 → take £4 in any combination).  
  - Freely exchange coins at any time (e.g., £5 = five £1s).

- **Dig in the Mine**  
  - Draw number of stones from the bag equal to die value.  
  - Reveal and discard black rocks immediately.  
  - **If white rock is drawn**:  
    - Return **all discarded stones** (from all players) **and all newly drawn stones** to the bag.  
    - Reshuffle for future draws.  
  - Keep gems face-up in front of you ("saved gems").  
  - May sell gems at any time during your turn using base values:  
    - Transparent: £1  
    - Blue: £3  
    - Red: £5  

- **Place a Tent**  
  - Place tent in the **column with the Steamboat**, in the **row matching the die number** (1–6, marked by crowns).  
  - Pay expedition cost shown on riverbank for that column.  
  - If placing in a space already occupied:  
    - Pay **£1 to each player** who already has a tent there.  
    - Payment required even if using *Native Guide* (free placement).  
  - A player may place multiple tents in the same column in one round if they take multiple dice.

#### Free Actions (May Be Taken Any Time During Your Turn)  
These do **not** require a die action:

- **Sell Gemstones**  
  - Exchange any number of saved gems for coins using base values.

- **Donate to the Queen**  
  - Announce donation.  
  - Place any amount (>£0) from your supply into your Treasure Chest.  
  - Amount remains secret.  
  - Donated coins cannot be removed.

- **Play Action Cards**  
  - *Native Guide*: Place tent without paying expedition cost (still need die and correct column).  
  - *Elephants*: Place tent in **any row** of current column (still pay cost and fees).  
  - *Camp Expansion*: Place **additional tent free** in any space (to the left of Steamboat) where you already have a tent. No die needed. Does not score now, but counts in final row scoring.  
  - *Reverse*: Move Steamboat **back one column**. That column is now active. At end of round, score **only** that column (including previously scored tents). Next round, Steamboat moves forward as normal.  
  - *Treasure*: Gain £4 from bank.  
  - *Royal Favor*: Take two dice in one turn (must be higher than previous die, if any); perform both actions.  
  - *Scientific Advancement*: Gain immediate victory points as shown on card (or save until final scoring).  
  - *Market*: Sell any gems at enhanced rates:  
    - Transparent: £1 + 1 VP  
    - Blue: £2 + 2 VP  
    - Red: £3 + 3 VP  
  - *Cave Discovery*: Draw 3 stones from bag. Discard rocks. If white rock drawn, return all drawn and discarded stones to bag.  
  - *Mine Collapse*: See above — affects all players’ unsold gems.

#### Card Combos  
- *Native Guide* + *Elephants* played together:  
  - Place tent in **any row** of current column, **free of charge**.  
  - Still requires a die.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Final Scoring (After Last Column Is Scored)  
1. **Row Majorities**  
   - For each of the 6 rows:  
     - Only the player with **most tents** in that row scores the row value (shown on left).  
     - In case of tie: total points divided equally among tied players, **rounded down**.  
     - Example: 10 points, 3-way tie → each gets 3 points (10 ÷ 3 = 3.33 → 3).

2. **Unsold Gems**  
   - Each unsold gem = **1 victory point** (regardless of color).

3. **Scientific Advancement Cards**  
   - Reveal and gain VP shown on cards (if not already used).

4. **Market Card**  
   - May be played now to gain VP from gem sales.

#### Donation Check  
- All players reveal contents of their Treasure Chests.  
- The player(s) with **least total donated** are **eliminated**.  
- If tied for least, **all tied are eliminated**.

#### Determine Winner  
Among non-eliminated players:  
1. Highest VP wins.  
2. Tie? Compare **donated money** — highest wins.  
3. Still tied? Player who placed **most tents during the game** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I place a tent in a column behind the Steamboat?**  
A: No, unless using *Camp Expansion* or *Reverse* card. Normally, only current column (with Steamboat) is active.

**Q: What happens when the Steamboat is moved back via Reverse card?**  
A: The previous column becomes active. At end of round, score **only** that column (including tents scored earlier). Next round, Steamboat advances normally.

**Q: Can I play multiple cards in one turn?**  
A: Yes — any number, during your turn, as free actions.

**Q: Do I have to sell gems when I draw the white rock?**  
A: No — you just return all stones (discarded and current draw) to the bag. You keep no stones from that draw.

**Q: Can I use Royal Favor more than once?**  
A: Yes — if you have multiple *Royal Favor* cards, you can use each.

**Q: Can I move a tent?**  
A: Not directly. But in 2-player game, when out of tents, you may **move** one from the board (see variation).

**Q: Do Camp Expansion tents count for row scoring?**  
A: Yes — they count toward row majority, but **do not score during regular column scoring**.

**Q: Can I donate zero?**  
A: No — minimum donation is £1. But you may choose never to donate.
