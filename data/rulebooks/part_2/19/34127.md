## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
"Ticket to Ride: The Card Game" is a strategic card-based adaptation of the popular board game. Players compete to complete Destination Tickets by collecting and playing Train cards of specific colors. The goal is to score the most points by completing routes, earning Big City Bonuses, and minimizing penalties from uncompleted Tickets.

### 2. Components  
- Train Cards: 100 total  
  - 9 colors × 10 cards each = 90  
  - 16 Locomotive (wild) cards  
- Destination Tickets:  
  - 46 total:  
    - 2 × 1-color (5 pts each)  
    - 17 × 2-color (6–10 pts)  
    - 14 × 3-color (11–15 pts)  
    - 11 × 4-color (16–20 pts)  
    - 2 × 5-color (21–22 pts)  
- 6 Big City Bonus cards  
- 1 Locomotive card per player (used during setup)  

### 3. Setup  
- Each player receives:  
  - 1 Locomotive card  
  - 7 random Train cards  
  - 6 Destination Tickets (must keep at least 1; return unwanted ones to the bottom of the deck)  
- Reveal 5 Train cards face up in the Draw Area.  
- Place the 6 Big City Bonus cards aside for endgame scoring.  
- Youngest player goes first.

#### Solo Variant Setup (Optional)  
- Shuffle all Train cards. Deal 1 Locomotive + 7 additional cards to yourself.  
- Set aside 16 Train cards as the **Station Clock deck**.  
- Remaining Train cards form the **Train deck**.  
- Reveal 5 cards in the Draw Area: 4 from the Train deck, 1 from the Station Clock deck (placed separately).  
- Shuffle Tickets. Deal 6 to yourself. Must keep the highest-value Ticket. Keep 0–5 others.  
- Set aside 6 Tickets face down (hidden opponent’s Tickets).  
- Remaining Tickets form the Ticket deck.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, perform these steps in order:

#### Standard Game  
1. **Move Cards to On-the-Track Stack**  
   - Move 1 Train card of each color from your Railyard (face-up area) to your On-the-Track stack (face-down scoring stack).  
   - If you have Locomotive cards in any color group, move them first.  
   - Players may not look at their On-the-Track stack during the game.

2. **Take One Action** (choose one):  
   - **Draw Train Cards**:  
     - Draw 2 cards from:  
       - The face-up Draw Area (up to 5 cards), or  
       - The Train deck (blind).  
     - Drawing a face-up Locomotive counts as **two cards** toward your draw limit.  
     - Do not refill drawn face-up cards immediately.  
     - If 3+ Locomotives are ever visible in the Draw Area, do **not** replace them until one is taken.  
   - **Play Train Cards to Railyard**:  
     - You may play Train cards only if:  
       - You play **more cards of a color** than any other player currently has in their Railyard for that color.  
       - That player must discard all cards of that color from their Railyard.  
     - You **cannot add** to a color already in your Railyard.  
     - Valid plays:  
       - Exactly 3 cards of **different colors** (no Locomotives).  
       - 2+ cards of **one color** (Locomotives allowed).  
   - **Draw Destination Tickets**:  
     - Draw 4 Tickets, keep 0–4.  
     - Return unwanted Tickets to the **bottom** of the Ticket deck.

#### Solo Variant Turn Order  
1. **Step 1: Advance Station Clock**  
   - Draw the top card from the Station Clock deck and place it face up next to the Station Clock (forms a 5th face-up card in Draw Area).  
   - **Color Match Rule**:  
     - If this card matches the color of **any** other face-up card in the Draw Area, **discard all matching color cards** from the Draw Area and draw replacements from the Train deck.  
     - Exception: Only the initial Station Clock card of the turn triggers this. New replacement cards do not cause cascading discards.  
     - If a **Locomotive** is drawn from Station Clock, remove **all other Locomotives** from the Draw Area.  

2. **Step 2: Move to On-the-Track Stack**  
   - Same as standard game: move 1 card per color from Railyard to On-the-Track stack. Locomotives moved first.

3. **Step 3: Take One Action**  
   - Same options as standard game.  
   - You **cannot** draw from the Station Clock deck directly.  
   - You **can** draw any of the 5 face-up cards (including the Station Clock card).  
   - Do **not** replace cards drawn from the Station Clock pile.

#### Train Robbing (Solo Variant Only)  
- **The Game Robs You**:  
  - If at any time, the number of cards of a color in the Draw Area **exceeds** the number in your Railyard, discard **all** your cards of that color from your Railyard.  
- **You Rob the Game**:  
  - If you play more cards of a color to your Railyard than are currently face-up in the Draw Area, discard **all** matching color cards from the Draw Area.  
  - Draw replacements from the Train deck.  
- **Multiple Robberies Possible**:  
  - After replacements, check for new imbalances. Continue resolving robberies until no color has an imbalance.  
  - Ties (equal counts) do **not** trigger robbery.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Railyard**: Face-up area where players build sets of Train cards by color. Cannot add to existing colors.  
- **On-the-Track Stack**: Face-down stack used for scoring. One card per color moved each turn.  
- **Train Robbing**: Competitive mechanic where players (or game) can force discards by outnumbering opponent’s visible cards.  
- **Locomotives**: Wild cards. Count as any color. When played in a color group, moved to On-the-Track first.  
- **Color Restrictions**:  
  - Cannot play cards in a color already present in your Railyard.  
  - Cannot play cards in a color currently visible in the Draw Area (in Solo Variant only, if it would cause a conflict with robbing rules).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Standard Game End  
- Game ends when the **Train deck is exhausted**.  
- All players get **one final turn**, ending with the player who drew the last card.  
- After final turns:  
  - Shuffle all **discarded** Train cards and all **Railyard + On-the-Track** cards (except hand) into a new Train deck.  
  - Deal **4 additional Train cards** to each player.  
  - Resume play until **this second deck is exhausted**, then final scoring occurs.

#### Solo Variant End  
- Game lasts exactly **16 turns** (16 cards in Station Clock deck).  
- Game ends after Step 3 of the turn when the **last Station Clock card is drawn**.  
- Player completes full turn.

#### Final Scoring (All Versions)  
1. **Complete Destination Tickets**:  
   - Use cards in **On-the-Track stack** to fulfill Tickets.  
   - May use any combination; Locomotives act as wilds.  
   - **Completed Tickets**: Add face value.  
   - **Uncompleted Tickets**: Subtract face value.  
2. **Big City Bonuses**:  
   - For each of the 6 Big Cities:  
     - Player with **most completed Tickets** involving that City earns the bonus.  
     - **Tie**: All tied players score the bonus.  
     - Some Tickets count toward **two** Big Cities.  
3. **Solo Variant Only**:  
   - Reveal the **6 hidden Tickets**.  
   - Award Big City Bonuses **as if** the hidden Tickets were completed by an opponent.  
   - Player wins if their **total score exceeds** the implied opponent's total (based on hidden Tickets and bonuses).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a color already in the Draw Area?**  
  - Standard: Yes, unless it triggers a robbery.  
  - Solo: No, if doing so would violate robbing rules (e.g., you can’t play a color that’s already face-up unless you exceed it and trigger a robbery).  
- **What happens when the Train deck runs out in solo play?**  
  - Continue playing; only the Station Clock deck determines game length.  
- **Can I look at my On-the-Track stack?**  
  - No. Stack remains face down until scoring.  
- **Do Locomotives count toward color totals for robbing?**  
  - Yes. They count as their played color.  
- **What if I can’t replace a discarded face-up card due to empty deck?**  
  - Leave the Draw Area with fewer cards. Game continues.  
- **Can I complete a Ticket using only Locomotives?**  
  - Yes, as long as the number and color requirements are met (Locomotives substitute for any color).
