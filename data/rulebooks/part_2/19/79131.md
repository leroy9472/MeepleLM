# Star Trek Expeditions – Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective

Star Trek Expeditions is a cooperative board game where players take on the roles of iconic Star Trek characters from the original series (and various expansions) to complete critical missions under time pressure. Each scenario is based on key Star Trek storylines (e.g., "The Search for Spock," "The Voyage Home," "The Best of Both Worlds"). The crew must work together to complete mission objectives before time runs out or the Enterprise is destroyed.

**Primary Objective:** Complete all three mission arcs (varies per expansion) by successfully resolving Captain’s Log challenges. The game is won if all missions are completed and final scoring results in no mission tracker falling below zero. Victory is determined by final score and mission success levels.

**Failure Conditions:**
- The Time Tracker reaches the final space (Klingon arrival or time limit).
- The Enterprise is destroyed (clix reduced to 0-0-0).
- After final scoring, any Mission Tracker is below zero.

## 2. Components

- **4–8 Character Figures & Cards** (varies by expansion): Each with unique skills and special actions.
- **2 Starships**: U.S.S. Enterprise and enemy vessel (e.g., Klingon D7, Bird of Prey, Borg Cube), each with Clix bases.
- **Game Board**: Depicts planetary surface (15 areas) and orbit track.
- **Captain’s Log Cards** (21 total): Divided into 3 mission stacks (e.g., Politics, Rebels, Energy).
- **Captain’s Log Supplemental Cards** (25): 9 Location Cards, 16 Event Cards, placed face down at setup.
- **Time Tracker Token**
- **Mission Tracking Board & 3 Trackers**
- **20 Discovery Tokens**: 15 regular (black square), 5 Major (gold hexagon).
- **42 Energize Cards**: Includes Crew Cards (permanent) and Action Cards (single use).
- **14 Stardate Cards**: Dictate turn events and action count.
- **3 Special Dice**: 2 white Federation Dice (1–5, 7), 1 black Klingon Die (2–6, repair symbol).
- **Summary Cards** (4): Player reference.

## 3. Setup

1. **Board & Time**: Place board, set Time Tracker to "0".
2. **Supplemental Cards**: Separate 9 Location Cards from 16 Event Cards. Shuffle 6 random Event Cards with 9 Location Cards. Place one face down on each of the 15 planet areas.
3. **Discovery Tokens**: Place one regular token face up in each area.
4. **Major Discovery Tokens**: Place 5 gold tokens near board.
5. **Captain’s Log Cards**: Sort into 3 mission stacks. Arrange each stack: 1, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D. Flip top card ("1") face up.
6. **Mission Tracking**: Place Mission Trackers at "0" on each tracker.
7. **Stardate Deck**: Shuffle and place near board.
8. **Energize Cards**: Shuffle, deal 2 to each player. Deploy Crew Cards face up; keep Action Cards hidden.
9. **Characters**: Each player chooses 1–4 characters. Place figures on Enterprise at max clix. Place character cards in front.
10. **Starships**: Place Enterprise at orbit "0", enemy ship (e.g., Klingon) at "7". Set both to max clix.
11. **Dice**: Place near board.

## 4. Gameplay Flow

Each turn proceeds in two phases:

### I. Flip Stardate Card
- Reveal top Stardate Card.
- Resolve events in order (blue → yellow → red) based on difficulty:
  - **Stardate Symbol(s)**: Advance Time Tracker 1 space per symbol.
  - **Klingon Symbol**: Trigger starship battle.
  - **Special Event**: Follow text (e.g., lose clix, beam restriction).
- The number in the corner indicates max actions for this turn (2–4).

### II. Take Actions
The active player may take up to the number of actions indicated. Actions may be repeated except Beam actions.

**Allowed Actions:**
- **On Enterprise**:
  1. Visit Sickbay (heal clix via die roll).
  2. Make Enterprise Attack (initiate starship battle).
  3. Beam Down (move to any planet area).
- **On Planet**:
  1. Beam Up (return to Enterprise).
  2. Move (to adjacent area).
  3. Pick up Discovery Token.
- **Anywhere**:
  1. Execute Special Character Action.
  2. Draw one Energize Card.
  3. Transfer one Crew Card (if in same location).
  4. Attempt a Challenge (if in area with face-up challenge).

**Free Actions (unlimited, no action cost):**
- Play an Energize Card (Action or Crew).
- Exchange Discovery Tokens with characters in same location.
- Install Klingon Equipment Token on Enterprise.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Clix System
- Characters and ships have rotating Clix bases showing current stats (Command, Science, Operations, Shields, Weapons).
- Gain clix (rotate counterclockwise), lose clix (clockwise).
- Max and min (0) enforced. Characters can act at 0 clix; ships are destroyed at 0-0-0.

### Challenges
- Occur on Captain’s Log and Event Cards.
- Types: Command (yellow), Science (blue), Operations (red).
- To attempt:
  1. Roll both white dice.
  2. Add matching clix value of character.
  3. Add bonuses from:
     - Matching Crew Cards (+1 or +2).
     - Matching skills (+2 per skill match).
     - Discovery Tokens (+2 each, not discarded).
     - Other characters in location (+2 each).
     - "Crew on Space" bonus (+2 per Crew Card in location).
  4. Play Action Cards or discard Discovery Tokens for additional bonuses.
  5. Spend clix: −2 clix = +1 to total.
- **Success**: Gain reward (points, cards, tokens), advance mission.
- **Failure**: Lose 1 clix, challenge remains.
- Rolling a "7" causes −1 clix after challenge resolution.

### Special Character Actions
- **Kirk**: Transfer 1 Crew Card to/from any player (any location).
- **Spock**: Look at any face-down card, return face down.
- **McCoy**: Heal a character in location equal to one white die roll.
- **Uhura**: Draw one Energize Card, keep or give to any player.
- **Scotty**: Beam Up/Down another character during your Beam action.
- **Sulu**: Copy a skill from a character or Crew Card at location (until end of turn).
- **Chekov**: Transfer 1 Discovery Token to/from any player.

### Starship Battles
Triggered by:
- Stardate Card (Klingon symbol).
- Challenge result.
- Player action ("Make Enterprise Attack").

**Battle Sequence (Klingons Attack):**
1. Move Klingon ship 1 space toward Enterprise.
2. If adjacent, Enterprise may retreat (no action).
3. **Klingon Attack**: Roll black die + weapon clix (range matters). If ≥ Enterprise shields, Enterprise loses 1 clix. Critical Hit (if attack ≥3 over defense): lose 2 clix.
4. **Enterprise Returns Fire**: Roll white die + weapon clix. If ≥ Klingon shields, Klingon loses 1 clix. If attack ≥3 over defense and Charge icon present, move both ships 1 space right.

**Enterprise Attacks**: Reverse order—Enterprise fires first.

**Modifiers**:
- Player may play Action Cards or discard Discovery Tokens for bonuses.
- Klingon Equipment Tokens on Enterprise provide permanent or one-time bonuses.

## 6. Scoring & End Game

### End Game Triggers:
- Time Tracker reaches final space.
- Enterprise destroyed.
- All three missions completed.

### Final Scoring:
1. Apply orbit value (Enterprise position) as bonus/penalty to each Mission Tracker.
2. If any tracker < 0, all players lose.
3. Total all three mission scores.
4. Apply victory conditions based on score and mission success.

**Victory Tiers (Base Game):**
- 0–19: Mission Complete
- 20–29: Commendation
- 30–39: Prenatares Ribbon
- 40+: Starfleet Silver Palm
- All missions ≥16: Starfleet Medal of Honor

**Expansion Scoring**: Uses score charts (e.g., "Rescue Picard", "Spock", "Probe") with tiered narrative outcomes based on final scores.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can I transfer Crew Cards during a challenge?**  
  No. Transfers must be done as an action or free action before or after the challenge.

  No. Only Crew Cards following characters in the same location.

- **Can I use Action Cards during another player’s turn?**  
  No. Only during your own turn.

  It stays empty. No reshuffling.
