## AQUÄDUKT – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the fertile lands of ancient Roman provinces, players act as canal and house builders striving to develop regions with housing. However, houses are only valuable if supplied with water via aqueducts. The objective is to construct houses and ensure they are supplied with water before their region fills up. At game end, the player with the most houses supplied with water wins.

### 2. Components  
- Game board: 20 numbered regions (each with 4, 5, or 6 spaces)  
- 112 House tiles (28 per player, 4 colors):  
  - 8 × 1-house  
  - 8 × 2-houses  
  - 8 × 3-houses  
  - 4 × 4-houses  
- 1 × 20-sided die  
- 5 Springs (also referred to as Wells)  
- 36 Canal pieces  
- 8 Mountain tiles (standard side used in base game; reverse used in variant)

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player takes all house tiles of one color and sorts them into four face-up stacks by value (1, 2, 3, and 4 houses).  
2. Place mountain tiles on empty board spaces:  
   - 2 players: 8 mountains  
   - 3 players: 6 mountains  
   - 4 players: 4 mountains  
   - Mountains must not be placed on top of houses or canals; no restriction on spacing in base game (variant adds spacing rule).  
3. Place springs and canals in a supply next to the board.  
4. Determine starting player (highest die roll or random). Play proceeds clockwise.

> **Note on house quantities (per summary files):**  
> - In 3-player games, only 7 of each 1-, 2-, and 3-house tiles are used.  
> - In 4-player games, only 6 of each 1-, 2-, and 3-house tiles are used.  
> - All players always use all 4 of their 4-house tiles.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, choose **exactly one** of the following three actions:

#### A. Build Houses (Roll Die Up to 3 Times)  
- Roll the 20-sided die.  
- Place one house tile on any **free space** in the region matching the die roll (1–20).  
- If the rolled region has **no free spaces**, re-roll.  
- Cannot build on mountain spaces.  
- After each roll, the player may:  
  - Place a house tile from their supply, or  
  - End their turn immediately.  
- May perform up to **three rolls/placements** per turn.  
- **Exception (Watered Spaces Rule):**  
  - If placing on a space **already supplied with water**, the player **must** use their **lowest-value remaining house tile**.  
  - Example: If the player still has 1-house tiles, they must use one. If none remain but 2-house tiles do, they must use a 2-house tile.

#### B. Discover a Spring (Place a Spring)  
- Place one spring on any **free intersection** (corner where spaces meet), including within regions or at board edges.  
- Springs must be **at least 5 intersections apart** from any other spring.  
- Springs are **neutral** and usable by all players.  
- First spring may be placed even if no canals exist.

#### C. Build Canals  
- Place **1 or 2 canals** during the turn.  
- Canals are placed **between spaces** (edges), not on spaces.  
- Each canal placed must:  
  - Be adjacent to a spring or an existing canal.  
  - Be part of a system connected to **exactly one spring**.  
- From each spring, **maximum two canal directions** may extend (i.e., canals can leave a spring in up to two directions).  
- Canals may **turn**, but **cannot branch** (no forking).  
- Can build on **different spring systems** in one turn (if placing two canals).  

##### Double Canals  
- A double canal is formed when a second canal is placed **directly adjacent** (parallel) to an existing single canal.  
- Double canals must **originate at a spring** — a single canal cannot later be “upgraded” downstream unless the second canal traces back to the spring.  
- A downstream section **cannot carry more water** than its upstream source. Thus, double canals must begin at or near the spring.

---

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Water Supply  
- A **single canal** supplies water to **1 space on each side** (adjacent).  
- A **double canal** supplies water to **2 spaces on each side** (adjacent and one away).  
- A house is supplied if:  
  - Adjacent to a single canal, or  
  - Within 2 spaces of a double canal (i.e., adjacent or one space away on either side).

#### Full Regions  
- When the **last space** in a region is filled:  
  - All **houses not supplied with water** in that region are **immediately removed** from the game.  
  - Houses **supplied with water** remain permanently.  
  - Vacant spaces (from removal) become **available for future building**.  
- This check occurs **immediately** upon region completion.

#### Neutral Infrastructure  
- Springs and canals are **shared** and do **not belong** to any player.  
- All players benefit from all water systems.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End Trigger  
- The game ends when **all 36 canals** have been placed.  
- The **current round is completed**, so all players have taken an equal number of turns.

#### Final Scoring  
1. Remove all house tiles **not supplied with water**.  
2. Each player counts the **total number of houses** on their remaining tiles (e.g., a 3-house tile counts as 3).  
3. The player with the **highest total wins**.  

#### Tiebreaker  
- If tied in total houses, the player with the **most individual house tiles** (i.e., number of tiles, not house count) supplied with water wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I place a house in a region that already has water, but choose not to use my lowest-value tile?**  
A: No. If the space is already watered, you **must** use your lowest-value remaining tile.

**Q: Can I build a canal that connects to two different springs?**  
A: No. Each canal system must be fed by **exactly one spring**.

**Q: Can I place two canals in different directions from the same spring in one turn?**  
A: Yes, as long as the spring does not already have two directions in use.

**Q: Can a double canal start away from the spring?**  
A: No. Double canals must originate such that the double width **starts at or extends directly from the spring**; you cannot have a single canal that later becomes double unless the second canal traces back to the spring.

**Q: Do mountains block canals or springs?**  
A: No. Canals and springs are placed on edges and intersections — mountains only block **house placement** on their space.

**Q: Can I build on a space freed by a removed house in a full region?**  
A: Yes. Once unwatered houses are removed from a completed region, those spaces are **free for future use**.

### Variant: Mountain Tile Effects (Reverse Side)  

#### Setup  
- Use the **reverse side** of mountain tiles (6 “Mineral Spring”, 2 “Foul Waters”).  
- Shuffle face-down before placing.  
- During setup, place with **at least 2 empty spaces between each mountain tile** (orthogonal or diagonal).  
- Keep face-down until endgame.

#### Endgame Reveal  
At the end of the game (after final scoring setup), flip all mountain tiles. They affect the **four orthogonally adjacent spaces** (up, down, left, right).

##### Mineral Spring (+2)  
- Adjacent tiles gain **+2 points** if supplied by **at least two canals**.  
- If supplied by only one canal, score only normal house value.

##### Foul Waters (0)  
- Adjacent tiles score **normal value** only if supplied by **at least two canals**.  
- If supplied by only one canal, they are **worth 0** (removed before scoring).

#### “Supplied by Two Canals” Means:  
- Adjacent to a **double canal**, or  
- Adjacent to **two single canals**, or  
- Adjacent to a **single canal** and **one space away** from a **double canal**, or  
- One space away from **two double canals**.

> Note: These effects apply **after** standard water supply checks.
