## EXPLODING KITTENS: MINEFIELD EDITION — COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE MANUAL  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are navigating a dangerous minefield filled with cats. Your goal is to rescue as many cats as possible while avoiding deadly explosions. Each mine (Exploding Kitten) you trigger causes you to lose collected cats. Use strategy, special cards, and foresight to outlast others and build valuable cat families.

**Objective:** Score the most points by collecting individual cats and completing matching sets.  
- 1 point per cat card.  
- 1 bonus point for a family of 3 matching cats.  
- 2 bonus points for a family of 4 matching cats.  
Game ends when no more cards can be drawn. Highest score wins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Types & Effects:  

- **Cat**:  
  - Keep immediately. Worth 1 point. Contributes to family sets.  

- **Exploding Kitten**:  
  - **Immediately discard** this card.  
  - Remove **4 cards from your hand** and add them to the **bottom of the draw deck**.  
  - These 4 cards may include any combination (cats, special cards, or both).  
  - If you cannot discard 4 cards, you are **eliminated**.  

- **Defuse**:  
  - **Must be in hand** to avoid explosion.  
  - When you draw an Exploding Kitten, discard your Defuse card instead of losing 4 cards.  
  - After use, **do not draw a replacement card**.  
  - You may only hold one Defuse at a time.  

- **Nope**:  
  - Keep in hand.  
  - Discard to **block another player’s Attack or Favor**.  
  - Can be played **on your turn or others’ turns**.  
  - Cannot be used to block Exploding Kitten or Defuse.  

- **Shuffle**:  
  - Discard to **reshuffle all discarded Attack cards** back into the draw deck.  
  - Use at any time, even out of turn (before a draw occurs).  

- **Skip**:  
  - Discard to **end your turn immediately**.  
  - Next player **misses their turn**.  
  - Can be played after drawing an Exploding Kitten (if defused) to avoid risk.  

- **Attack**:  
  - Discard to **steal 2 cards** from any one player.  
  - Choose which cards are taken (from their hand).  
  - Target may use **Nope** to block.  

- **Favor**:  
  - Discard to **choose a player**; they must give you **1 card of their choice**.  
  - Target may use **Nope** to block.  

- **See the Future**:  
  - Discard to **look at the top 3 cards** of the draw deck.  
  - **Do not reveal** to others.  
  - Return them to the top in **any order**.  
  - No card is drawn during this action.  

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when the **draw deck is empty and no player can draw**.  
- Players tally:  
  - 1 point per cat collected.  
  - +1 bonus point for each **set of 3 matching cats** (same family/type).  
  - +2 bonus points for each **set of 4 matching cats**.  
- **Highest score wins.**  
- In case of tie, tied players share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play multiple Nope cards?**  
  Yes. If someone plays a Nope on your Nope, you can counter with another. Chain continues until no one responds.  

- **Can I use See the Future after drawing?**  
  Yes, as long as it’s during your turn and before your turn ends.  

- **What happens if I draw an Exploding Kitten and have no Defuse?**  
  Discard the Exploding Kitten, then remove 4 cards from your hand and place them at the bottom of the deck. If you have fewer than 4 cards, you are **eliminated**.  

- **Can I steal a cat that’s already collected?**  
  No. Collected cats are **set aside**, not in hand. Only cards in hand can be stolen.  

- **Can I use Skip after drawing a card?**  
  Yes. Discard Skip to end your turn and skip the next player.  

- **Do Attack and Favor require target to have cards?**  
  Yes. If target has no cards, the card has no effect (but is still discarded).  

- **When is Shuffle most useful?**  
  Use before a risky draw, especially after many Attacks have been discarded, to reduce predictability.
