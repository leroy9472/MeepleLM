## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Orongo*, players take on the roles of competing tribes on Easter Island striving to erect monumental Moai statues along the coast and ultimately claim victory by constructing the Ceremonial Moai at Orongo. The goal is to be the first to complete all your Moai, including the Ceremonial Moai, by strategically bidding for placement priority and connecting the right resources.

**Objective**: Be the first player to erect the Ceremonial Moai by fulfilling its construction requirements. If no one completes it during the final round, the player with the fewest Moai remaining wins, with shells breaking ties.

### 2. Components
- 1 game board (Easter Island with 50 palm spaces and 60 numbered resource spaces)
- 60 numbered resource tiles (each matching a space on the board)
- 4 player screens
- 160 transparent tokens (40 per player in 4 colors)
- 48 shells
- 1 amulet
- 21 Moai:
  - 20 regular Moai (10 for 2 players, 6 for 3 players, 5 for 4 players)
  - 1 Ceremonial Moai (placed on the board at start)

---

### 3. Setup
1. Place the game board in the center.
2. Shuffle the 60 resource tiles and place them face-down beside the board.
3. Each player receives:
   - 1 screen
   - 40 tokens of their color (personal supply)
   - Shells:
     - 2 players: 24 shells each
     - 3 players: 16 shells each
     - 4 players: 12 shells each
   - Moai:
     - 2 players: 10 Moai each
     - 3 players: 6 Moai each (return 2 to box)
     - 4 players: 5 Moai each
4. Place the Ceremonial Moai on its designated space (top right of board).
5. The oldest player takes the amulet and places it in front of their screen.

**Optional Variation (3–4 players)**: Each player draws one random resource tile at setup and keeps it hidden. If it’s a quarry, replace it and shuffle the quarry back in. This tile may be placed later with an extra token.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds in three phases:

#### 1. Place New Resource Tiles
- **First round**:
  - 2–3 players: 6 tiles placed
  - 4 players: 8 tiles placed
- **All subsequent rounds**:
  - 2–3 players: 3 tiles placed
  - 4 players: 4 tiles placed
- One player draws tiles and places each on its matching numbered space on the board.

#### 2. Bid for Spaces
All players simultaneously choose any number of shells (including zero) and reveal them at the same time.

- **Highest bidder**:
  - Places all bid shells on the reef (bottom right of board)
  - Takes **3 tokens** to their staging area
- **Second-highest bidder**:
  - Returns shells to their screen
  - Takes **2 tokens**
- **Other players with ≥1 shell bid**:
  - Return shells to screen
  - Take **1 token**
- **Players who bid 0 shells**:
  - Take **all shells from the reef**
  - If multiple players bid 0, they split the reef shells equally; any remainder stays on the reef
  - Do **not** take a token

**Tie-breaking**:
- Tied bids are resolved in clockwise order from the player holding the amulet.
- The amulet holder **always loses** the tie.

After bidding:
- The highest bidder receives the amulet.

#### 3. Place Tokens and Erect Moai

##### A. Token Placement Order
1. Player with 3 tokens (bid winner) places all 3
2. Player with 2 tokens (second place) places both
3. Players with 1 token place in clockwise order from the amulet holder

##### B. Placement Rules
A token may be placed:
- On any **empty numbered resource tile**
- On any **empty palm space adjacent to one of your existing tokens**

*Note*: Palm spaces are for connection or Moai construction; only coastal palm spaces can host Moai.

##### C. Erecting Moai
A player **must immediately erect a Moai** if, after placing a token, they form a connected group that satisfies **both** conditions:

**Condition A**: The group includes one of the following resource combinations:
- 1 quarry
- 1 temple + 1 god
- 1 birdman + 1 nest
- 2 food tiles

**Condition B**: An additional token in the same connected group is on a **coastal palm space** that does **not** already have a Moai.

When erecting a Moai:
- Place one of your Moai on the **coastal palm space**
- Place **one shell** on each **used resource tile** (1 or 2 tiles) to mark them as **spent**
  - Spent tiles cannot be reused for future Moai construction
  - Spent tiles still count for connecting tokens

**Critical Restriction**:
- If a player does **not have enough shells** to cover the required resource tiles when erecting a Moai, they **cannot place the final token** that would trigger construction.
- The player must instead place that token elsewhere.

*Note*: Inland palm spaces cannot support Moai; they are only for connecting tokens.

**Optional Variation (3–4 players)**:
- At any time during their turn, a player may place their hidden starting tile **plus one additional token**.
- This can be done even if they bid 0 shells.
- Placement must follow standard rules.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends **immediately** when a player erects the **Ceremonial Moai**, **provided** they have already placed all their personal Moai.

- The **first player** to erect the Ceremonial Moai **wins instantly**.
- Players do **not** finish the round.

**Alternate End (Final Round)**:
- When there are **not enough resource tiles left** to place the required number for the round, the **last round** begins.
- No new tiles are placed this round.
- After bidding and token placement, if **no player erects the Ceremonial Moai**, the winner is determined as follows:

1. The player with the **fewest Moai remaining** wins.
2. If tied, the player with the **most shells** wins.
3. If still tied, there is **more than one winner**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I place tokens on spent tiles?**  
  Yes, as long as the tile is empty and unoccupied. Spent tiles can still connect tokens.

- **Can I use the same coastal palm space twice?**  
  No. Once a Moai is erected on a palm space, no further Moai can be built there.

- **Can I place a token on a palm space not adjacent to my tokens?**  
  No. All palm space placements must be adjacent to an existing token of your color.

- **Can I erect multiple Moai in one turn?**  
  Yes, if placing a single token triggers multiple valid groups (e.g., connecting to two separate valid resource sets with coastal access), you must erect all qualifying Moai.

- **What if I run out of shells?**  
  You can still bid 0 and collect from the reef. You can also receive shells via the 0-bid rule.

- **Does the amulet change hands every round?**  
  Yes. The highest bidder receives the amulet at the end of each bidding phase.

- **Can I place my hidden tile at any time?**  
  Yes, during your placement phase, even if you bid 0. You must also place one token with it.

- **Can I place a Moai on a spent resource group?**  
  No. The resource tiles must be unspent at the time of construction.
