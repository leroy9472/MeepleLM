## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Neuland lies undeveloped, a land of opportunity where players compete to build a thriving civilization. Through constructing production facilities and advancing up technology chains, players convert raw resources into victory points (Coats of Arms). The goal is to be the first to place all of your Coats of Arms on Prestige Buildings (Advances), immediately winning the game.

2. Components  
- 10 Terrain Tiles (9 double hex, 1 single hex)  
- 32 Meepees (Workers) – 8 per player  
- 72 Coats of Arms – 18 per player  
- 4 Player Boards  
- 4 Wheelbarrows (1 per player)  
- 4 Wood Tokens  
- 4 Food Tokens  
- 4 Metal Markers (Iron/Silver)  
- 21 Minerals:  
  - 9 Coal  
  - 6 Iron Ore  
  - 6 Silver Ore  
- 1 Cloth Bag  
- 6 Time Track Frame Pieces (double-sided)  
- 1 Time Marker  
- 2 Building Boards (large and small)  
- 57 Buildings (diamond-shaped tiles), including:  
  - Basic Production (Type A)  
  - Conversion (Type B)  
  - Prestige Buildings / Advances (Type C)  

3. Setup  
- Choose Time Track side:  
  - 2–3 players: Use side with 3 dots (11 spaces, 10 turns)  
  - 4 players: Use side with 4 dots (10 spaces, 9 turns)  
  - *Optional (Original Rules): Always use 3-dot track, even with 4 players.*  
- Assemble the Time Track frame into a hexagon and place terrain tiles randomly inside (or use suggested setup).  
- Prepare Building Boards:  
  - Smaller board: Stack numbered Prestige Buildings face-down, lowest number on top.  
  - Larger board: Stack all other buildings face-down.  
  - Place Metal Markers on large board.  
- Place Minerals in the Cloth Bag.  
- Each player takes:  
  - 1 Player Board  
  - 1 Hunting Lodge  
  - 1 Woodcutter’s Hut  
  - 1 Wheelbarrow  
  - 1 Wood Token  
  - 1 Food Token  
  - 8 Meepees (Workers)  
  - Coats of Arms: 18 (2p), 12 (3p), 9 (4p)  
- Return unused components to the box.  
- Place Time Marker on any space of the Time Track.  
- Place one Meeple from each player on the same space as the Time Marker.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
- First Round:  
  - Starting player chosen randomly.  
  - Players take turns clockwise.  
  - Each player places Hunting Lodge and Woodcutter’s Hut on a single Forest hex.  
  - Then takes a normal turn (except Time Marker is not advanced).  
- Subsequent Rounds:  
  - Advance Time Marker clockwise until it reaches a Meeple.  
  - That player takes their turn.  
  - Turns are not sequential—player order depends on Meeple positions.  

Turn Sequence (per player):  
1. Lay Down Workers: Lay flat all of your standing Meepees on the board. These represent resources that must be used this turn or be lost.  
2. Perform Actions: Take any number of legal actions in any order.  
3. Remove Laying Workers: Remove all of your laying-down Meepees (and associated resources) from the board.  
4. Advance Time Marker: Move it clockwise until it reaches the next occupied space. That player goes next.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Meepees = Resources: A Meeple on a building represents ownership of that building’s output.  
- Action Costs: Measured in "Time" (spaces moved on Time Track).  
- Cannot end turn with Meeple on same space as another player’s Meeple or the Time Marker.  
- Can move Meeple forward without taking actions to avoid conflicts.  

Actions:  
- Produce a Resource:  
  - Place your Meeple on an empty building.  
  - Type A (e.g., Hunting Lodge): No input needed.  
  - Type B (e.g., Smelter): Requires input resources.  
  - Cost = Distance (in hexes) to farthest required input resource. Minimum cost = 1.  
  - Remove input Meepees when consumed.  
  - Move your Meeple on Time Track by cost amount.  
- Build a Building:  
  - Take top available building of any type from Building Boards.  
  - Place on terrain-matching hex (max 3 buildings per hex).  
  - Cost:  
    - Resource: Wood or Stone (shown on tile back).  
    - Time Cost = (Distance to resource) – 1. Minimum = 0.  
  - Move Meeple on Time Track by cost.  
- Recall Worker: Return one of your Meepees from the board to your supply. No cost.  
- Waste Time: Move your Meeple forward one space without acting.  
- Forage for Food (Original Rules only): Spend 3 Time to gain Food, usable immediately anywhere.  

Special Buildings:  
- Mine:  
  - When built: Draw 3 random Minerals from bag, stack in any order.  
  - Produce action takes top Mineral.  
  - When Meeple is removed, top Mineral is returned to bag.  
  - When stack is depleted, draw 3 more and restack (infinite supply).  
- Smelter:  
  - Convert Coal + Iron Ore → Iron, or Coal + Silver Ore → Silver.  
  - Place your Meeple and correct Metal Marker on Smelter.  
  - Together, they represent one Iron or Silver resource.  
  - When used or removed, return Metal Marker to Building Board.  
- Alchemist’s Cave:  
  - Convert Paper + Iron → Gold.  
  - Gold can substitute for any input resource.  

Special Tokens:  
- Wheelbarrow: Use once per game. Reduces transportation cost to 0:  
  - Build action costs 0 Time.  
  - Produce action costs 1 Time (minimum).  
- Wood/Food Tokens: Use once each to substitute for a Wood or Food resource. No transport cost.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Prestige Buildings (Type C / Advances):  
  - When built, player pays input resources and places number of Coats of Arms equal to building’s number (or fewer if insufficient).  
  - Building is then blocked—cannot be used again.  
- Game ends immediately when any player places their last Coat of Arms.  
- That player wins. No tiebreakers.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I build multiple buildings in one turn? Yes, if you have actions and resources.  
- Can I use another player’s resources? No. Only your own Meepees can be used as inputs.  
- Can I produce on a building with a laying-down Meeple? No. Buildings must be empty.  
- What if I can’t end my turn without overlapping a Meeple? Move forward without acting to an empty space.  
- Can I produce resources without using them? Yes, but they must be laid down and will be lost if not used by next turn.  
- Can I build on a hex with 3 buildings already? No. Max 3 per hex.  
- What happens if the bag is empty when drawing Minerals? The Mine section says players draw 3 more—assume infinite reshuffling (per standard interpretation).  
- Do I have to use all Coats of Arms on a Prestige Building? No. You may place fewer than the number shown.
