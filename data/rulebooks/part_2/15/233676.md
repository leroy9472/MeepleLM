4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   Each round proceeds in player order (start player first). Each turn has 4 phases:

   **I. Influence Phase (Optional)**  
   - **Night Shift**: Pay 1 Knowledge to rotate medium or large Ring 1 space clockwise.  
   - **Modification**: Pay 2 Knowledge to swap 2 Discs or move 1 Disc to free space.  
   - Cost increases by 1 Knowledge in round 11/10/9 (2/3/4 players).  
   - Repeating any action in same turn doubles cost each time (2×, 4×, etc.).

   **II. Action Phase**  
   - Activate up to 3 Discs, one per Ring, located in active (lower) half.  
   - Actions in any order.  
   - **Upgraded Discs**: Can use 2 actions from one upgraded Disc per turn.  
   - **Bonus Disc**: Grants extra activation:  
     - Normal: Reuse 1 activated Disc once.  
     - Upgraded: Reuse one Disc twice or two Discs once each.  
   - Disc Actions:  
     - **Resource (Energy/Mycelium/Obsidian)**: Gain 1 Resource per matching Ship.  
     - **City**:  
       - *Market*: Buy 1 Disc from market, paying price in Resources (1–4). Place on center of Wheel; add in Administration.  
       - *Investment*: Pay Level cost + 1 Resource per opponent ahead on Path. Move own Representative up 1 Level on any Path (or from Cave to Level 1). Cost requires all same or ≥2 different types (per symbol).  
     - **Journey**:  
       - Move Ambassador to any Island. Pay 1 Resource per opponent’s Ambassador there.  
       - If moving to unvisited Island, reveal it and place Ships:  
         - #players +1 on ↓↓, #players on ↓, #players –1 on ↓, #players –2 on ↓↓ (min 1 Ship).  
       - Then:  
         - *Ship*: Take 1 Ship from Island.  
         - *Factory*: Place 1 Factory on empty space; take 1 or 2 Warehouses (per space).  
     - **Tool**:  
       - *Upgrade*: Flip 1 normal Disc (not self, not just bought) to upgraded (light) side. Cannot activate upgraded Disc this turn.  
       - *Production*: Pay Resource cost to produce Goods. May produce:  
         - Multiple of one Good type, or  
         - One of each type (max one per Warehouse).  
         - Simple Goods (Propeller, Sail, Compass): 2 Resources.  
         - Complex Goods (Lamp, Piston): 3 Resources.  
     - **Black Market (anytime during Action Phase)**:  
       - Pay 1 simple Good → 2 Knowledge  
       - Pay 1 complex Good → 3 Knowledge  
       - Pay 3 Knowledge → 1 Resource of choice  
     - **Inspection (Substitute Action)**: Skip activating one Disc per Ring to gain 1 Knowledge. Ring cannot activate another Disc this turn.

   **III. Politics Phase (Optional)**  
   - **Intrigue**: Pay Knowledge equal to visible cogs on round track.  
     - Move 1 Politician from top of any Chamber to leftmost empty seat in bottom.  
     - Remove 1 Politician from top of any Chamber (back to box).  
   - Repeating Intrigue in same turn doubles cost each time (2×, 4×, etc.).

   **IV. Administration Phase**  
   - Gain 1 Knowledge per visible cog on Factory tableau (from built Factories).  
   - Rotate all 3 Rings 1 space clockwise (small → medium → large).  
   - Place new Discs (from Market) into any Wheel space (replacing Discs, which go back to box).

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Wheel Rotation**: Rings rotate each turn, cycling Discs between active/inactive halves.  
   - **Disc Upgrades**: Tool Disc flips other Discs to upgraded side for double actions.  
   - **Resource & Knowledge Management**: Critical for actions, upgrades, politics.  
   - **Path Advancement**: Representatives earn VPs based on Level × Chamber value.  
   - **Politician Placement**: Increases Chamber VP value; removal blocks opponents.  
   - **Travel**: In base game, Ambassador may go to any Island. In Expert, only adjacent (left/right).

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - Game ends after 14/15/16 rounds (4/3/2 players).  
   - Remove all remaining top Politicians.  
   - Score VPs:  
     - For each Path: Representative Level × leftmost visible VP value in corresponding Chamber.  
     - Specialization Chamber: Highest Representative Level × its VP value.  
     - Division Chamber: Lowest Representative Level × its VP value (Cave = Level 0).  
   - Sum all 6 values for total.  
   - **Tiebreaker**: Fewest total Ships + Warehouses wins. If still tied, shared victory.
