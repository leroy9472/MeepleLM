## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
1st & Goal is a dice-rolling football simulation game for 2–4 players. Players take turns on Offense and Defense, attempting to score points by advancing the football down the field. The objective is to outscore the opponent by the end of the game through touchdowns, field goals, safeties, and conversions.

2. Components  
- Two player decks (Offense and Defense)  
- Fake/Kick cards (one per player)  
- Yardage dice: Red, Green, Brown, Black  
- Special dice: Play Die (P), Referee Die (R), Penalty Die  
- Football marker and 1st down marker  
- Scoreboard with clear disks for tracking points  
- Timeout markers (3 per player)  
- R&R coin for kickoff determination  

3. Setup  
- Flip the R&R coin: winner chooses to receive or kick off.  
- Each player receives:  
  - 8-card hand drawn from their deck (Offense or Defense)  
  - 1 Fake/Kick card  
  - 3 Timeout markers  
- Place the football on the 20-yard line if the receiving team takes a touchback.  
- Position the 1st down marker in the first column.  
- Each team keeps their discard pile separate.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- On each turn:  
  1. Players simultaneously select a play card or call a Timeout.  
  2. Reveal cards. If Offense plays a running play, burn a card (discard from deck; if empty, from hand).  
  3. Roll appropriate dice based on play matchup.  
  4. Resolve yardage, Play Die effects, penalties, turnovers.  
  5. Advance ball and update down marker.  
  6. Draw back up to 8 cards.  
- Offense has 4 downs to gain 10 yards for a new set of downs.  
- After scoring, punting, or turnover: change hands (swap decks and hands).  
- Half ends when Offense has no cards left in hand or deck.  
- Second half begins with kickoff by team that received in first half. Reset timeouts to 3.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Play Die Results:**  
  - **Broken Play:** Yardage = 0.  
  - **Breakaway:** Move ball by yardage, then reroll same dice. Continue rerolling if Breakaway appears. Offense may stop if reroll yields negative yards.  
  - **Potential Turnover:** Move ball, then roll Referee die. On 'T', turnover occurs. Change hands. Turnover in opponent’s endzone = touchback (ball on 20).  
  - **Potential Penalty:** Roll Referee and Penalty dice before moving ball.  
    - Referee shows 'O': Offensive penalty.  
    - Referee shows 'D': Defensive penalty.  
    - Any other result: No penalty.  
    - Penalty yardage: 5, 5A (5 yards + automatic 1st down if on Defense), 10, or 15.  
    - Penalties repeat the down (except 5A). No card burn.  
    - Offensive penalties moving ball into own endzone: move ball half the distance to goal, max to 1-yard line.  
    - Either team may decline penalty.  
  - **HAIL/MARY:** No effect except on Hail Mary, QB Sneak, or punt.

- **Special Plays:**  
  - **Quarterback Sneak:** Only on 1 yard to go. Roll Play Die.  
    - 'X': Gain 1 yard, 1st down.  
    - 'T': No gain, lose 1 down.  
    - Penalty icon: Roll R and P. Apply if O or D. Else, lose 1 down.  
  - **Quarterback Kneel:** Only if Offense deck is empty. Discard 1 card from hand, lose 1 yard and 1 down.  
  - **Red Zone Rules:**  
    - Cards with red "10" or "20" cannot be played within respective yard lines (e.g., red 20 card unusable inside 20-yard line).  

- **Timeouts:**  
  - 3 per half. Mark used timeouts.  
  - When called (before card reveal), both players may:  
    - Search discard pile for one card and add to hand, OR  
    - Shuffle hand into deck and draw same number.  
  - Defense may use Timeout to prevent card burn on completed pass or running play.

- **Unplayable Hand:**  
  - If Offense cannot legally play a card (only restricted passes left), discard 1–2 cards and redraw. Repeat until playable.  
  - If no cards to draw, half ends.

- **Running Out the Clock:**  
  - After completed pass, Offense may burn a card to run time.  
  - Defense may prevent by calling Timeout.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Touchdown (6 points):** Ball reaches or crosses opponent’s 0-yard line.  
  - **Extra Point (1 point):** Roll Play and Referee dice. Blocked on two 'X'. Otherwise, score 1 point.  
  - **Two-Point Conversion:** One play from 2-yard line. Success = 2 points. Turnover or offensive penalty = 0.  
- **Field Goal (3 points):** Attempt from current line. Roll yardage dice; if total reaches 0-yard line, score. Defense rolls Play and Referee to block (two 'X' = block). Burn a card after attempt.  
- **Safety (2 points):** Ball enters Offense’s endzone. Offense punts from 20-yard line.  
- **Hail Mary:** Last play of half. Requires:  
  - 1–2 cards in hand  
  - On or past 35-yard line  
  - Roll Play and Referee: 'Hail' + 'Mary' = touchdown.  
- **Winning:** Highest score after two halves wins. Tie? Sudden death: first to score wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Onside Kick:** Ball starts at 30-yard line. Roll Red, Brown, Play, Referee dice.  
  - Success if: total ≥ 10 AND at least one 'T' on white dice.  
  - If successful, kicking team keeps possession.  
- **Squib Kick:** Ball on 30-yard line. Roll dice. No return allowed.  
- **Punt:** On 4th down.  
  - Option 1: Roll 5 yardage dice. Defense may return (roll Green + Play die) or call Fair Catch.  
  - Option 2: Replace one yardage die with Play Die. Effects:  
    - 'X': Blocked punt — receiving team gains ball.  
    - Extra bounce: Roll Red die, add to total.  
    - 'T': Roll Referee die. On 'T', Offense recovers downfield.  
    - Penalty: Roll R and P. Apply penalty, repeat punt from new spot.  
    - HAIL/MARY: Ball out of bounds or fair catch — no return.  
  - Punt into opponent’s endzone = touchback (ball on 20).  
- **Fake Punt/Field Goal:** Both players secretly choose Fake or Kick on their card, reveal simultaneously. Resolve per matchup.  
- **Changing Hands:** After turnover, punt, or score:  
  - Return hand to deck, shuffle, pass to opponent.  
  - Each draws 8 cards (or fewer if deck <8).  
- **Penalty on Punt:** If penalty occurs, adjust ball, repeat punt. May result in 1st down.  
- **Breakaway 3x Rule (Optional):** Three consecutive Breakaways = automatic touchdown.
