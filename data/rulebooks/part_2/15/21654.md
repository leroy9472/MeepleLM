## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Iliad*, players take on the roles of Greek heroes besieging Troy to rescue Helen. The objective is to be the first to accumulate **12 or more victory points**. Victory points are earned by collecting Victory cards (Trireme, City, Helen), earning special tiles (Agamemnon, Athena, Poseidon), and avoiding penalties from the Thanatos card.

The game ends immediately when any player reaches or exceeds 12 victory points. If the Oracle deck is exhausted before this, the player with the most points wins. Ties are resolved with a final Gorgon-type siege among tied players.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game consists of multiple **sieges**. Each siege proceeds as follows:

1. **Reveal Oracle and Victory cards**
2. **Players take turns clockwise**
3. **On your turn, do exactly one**:
   - Play a card to your army
   - Attack an opponent with a deployed card
   - Pass
4. **Siege ends** based on Oracle type:
   - **Thanatos**: All players pass
   - **Gorgon**: One player begins turn with highest army value
5. **Award Victory cards and tiles**
6. **Prepare for next siege**:
   - Discard played Army cards
   - Keep cards in hand
   - Deal 3 new Army cards (discard down to max hand size)
   - Reveal new Oracle and Victory cards
   - Player with Agamemnon starts next siege

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Playing Cards
- Cards played to table are **face-up and visible**.
- **Chariot, Elephant, Ballista, Catapult, Harrow, Trojan Horse**: Always placed **individually**, not stacked.
- **Hoplites**:
  - Can be played **individually** or **stacked** to form a **Phalanx**.
  - Phalanx rules:
    - Cards must be played in **decreasing value** (highest first).
    - Value = (sum of Hoplite values) × (number of cards)
    - Example: 4 + 3 + 1 = 8 × 3 = **24 points**
- **Archers**:
  - Can be played alone or on **Elephant** or **Trojan Horse**
- **On Elephant**:
  - Max **2 cards** (Hoplites or Archers)
  - Their values are **doubled**
  - Cards are fixed once placed
- **On Trojan Horse**:
  - Cards placed **face-down**
  - Revealed **only at end of siege**
  - Cannot be attacked directly

#### Attacking
Only **cards already on table** can be used to attack (except Chariot — see below). Attacking card and target are **discarded**.

| Attacker | Can Eliminate | Restrictions |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Chariot** | Archers, Hoplites (solitary or weakest in Phalanx) | Cannot attack if target has Harrow; **can be used from hand** |
| **Archers** | Archers, Hoplites (weakest in Phalanx) | Cannot attack cards on Elephant/Trojan Horse |
| **Archers on Elephant** | Archers, Hoplites, **strongest in Phalanx** | Same restrictions |
| **Catapult** | Catapult, Ballista, Harrow, Trojan Horse | Cannot attack cards on Trojan Horse (they fall off) |
| **Ballista** | Chariot, Elephant | Cards on Elephant fall off safely |
| **Hoplites, Elephant, Harrow, Trojan Horse** | **Cannot attack** | |

Additional rules:
- **Chariot is the only card** that can attack **directly from hand**
- **Harrow** protects from Chariot attacks: a player **with Harrow cannot be attacked by Chariot**
- **Cards on Elephant or Trojan Horse** cannot be targeted directly
- If **Elephant or Trojan Horse is destroyed**, supporting cards are revealed and placed separately (cannot be added to Phalanx or Elephant, but can start new Phalanx)

#### Passing
- **Thanatos siege**:
  - Player takes **highest-value available Hero**
  - Hero adds to army value at end
  - Hero placed **alone**, not in Phalanx or on units
  - Player **exits siege** (no more actions)
  - **Can still be attacked**, but **Hero cannot be eliminated**
- **Gorgon siege**:
  - Player **discards all played Army cards**
  - **Does not get a Hero**
  - **Exits siege permanently**

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### End of Siege: Thanatos
- All players have passed
- Reveal **Trojan Horse** contents
- **Calculate army value**:
  - Hoplites: Phalanx value or individual
  - Archers: 1 point (alone) or 2 points (on Elephant)
  - Chariot: 3 points
  - Others: 0 points (but provide abilities)
  - **Add Hero value**
- **Award Victory cards**:
  - Highest army: picks first Victory card + **Agamemnon tile**
  - Next highest: next Victory card (if available)
  - **Tie**: Higher Hero value wins
- **Weakest army**: takes **Thanatos card** (−2 VP)
  - **Tie**: Lower Hero value takes it

#### End of Siege: Gorgon
- Ends when **a player begins their turn** with army value **higher than all others**
  - Before playing or attacking
- That player takes **one Victory card** and **Agamemnon tile**
- **Others get nothing**
- **Unawarded Victory cards remain**
- **Add only one new Victory card** next siege
- **Gorgon card discarded**

#### Special Tiles
- **Agamemnon (1 VP)**: Awarded to siege winner. Changes hands each siege.
- **Athena (2 VP)**: Goes to player with **most City cards**. Stays if tied; only changes when someone has **strictly more**.
- **Poseidon (2 VP)**: Same, but for **Trireme cards**.

#### New Siege
- Return all **Hero cards** to center
- Discard **played Army cards**
- Keep **cards in hand**
- Deal **3 new Army cards**
- Discard down to:
  - 12 cards (3–5 players)
  - 10 cards (6 players)
- If draw deck empty: **reshuffle discards**
- Reveal new Oracle and Victory cards (see Setup)
- **Agamemnon holder starts**

#### End Game
- **Immediate win**: Any player reaches **12+ VP** (after taking a Victory card)
- **If Oracle deck is exhausted**:
  - Player with **most VP** wins
  - **Tie**: Tied players get 3 new Army cards and play **one final Gorgon siege**
    - No new Victory cards
    - Only tied players participate
    - **Agamemnon holder starts**; if none, highest Hero value from previous siege starts
    - Winner of siege wins game

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you pass multiple times in 2-player game?**  
  Yes. Players may pass and later play again. Siege ends only when **both pass consecutively**.

- **Can you have multiple Elephants or Trojan Horses?**  
  Yes. Each functions independently.

- **Can you place a card on a fallen Hoplite from Elephant/Trojan Horse?**  
  Yes. After destruction, fallen cards are separate and can be used to form **new Phalanx**.

- **Can a Phalanx include "jumps" in value?**  
  Yes. Values must decrease, but not by exactly 1 (e.g., 5 → 2 → 1 is valid).

- **Can you attack your own cards?**  
  No. Attacks are only against opponents.

- **Do Hero values count toward victory points?**  
  No. Only added to army strength during sieges.

- **What happens to cards on a destroyed Trojan Horse?**  
  They are revealed and placed separately. Cannot be placed on Elephant or in Phalanx immediately, but can start new Phalanx.

- **Negotiations allowed?**  
  Yes. Players may talk, bluff, or make promises, but **cannot trade cards**.
