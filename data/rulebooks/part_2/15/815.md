### 1. Lore & Objective

In *Crononautas*, players take on the role of time travelers known as Crononauts, each with a secret identity, a secret mission, and a unique goal: to repair paradoxes caused by changes in history. The game is set in a universe where time travel is possible, and players must navigate a shifting timeline to achieve one of three victory conditions.

Each player originates from an alternate reality and seeks to return home by altering history to match their personal timeline. Alternatively, they may complete a mission by collecting three specific artifacts, or win by amassing ten cards in hand.

The timeline is represented by 32 double-sided cards arranged in an 8x4 grid, depicting key historical events and their cascading consequences. Players use action cards to flip "Linchpin" events (pivotal moments), triggering changes in dependent "Ripplepoint" events (cascading outcomes), which may create paradoxes—tears in the space-time continuum.

The ultimate threat is the creation of a 13th paradox, which destroys the universe and causes all players to lose.

### 2. Components

- **32 Timeline Cards (double-sided, black border)**:
  - 13 **Linchpin Cards**: Pivotal historical events that can be flipped to alter history (e.g., "Kennedy is assassinated" ↔ "JFK wounded in motorcade").
  - 19 **Ripplepoint Cards**: Dependent events affected by Linchpin changes. When conditions are met, they flip to show a paradox (a "tear" in time).
- **80 Game Cards (white border)**:
  - 20 **Inverter Cards**: Used to flip Linchpin events (e.g., "Avoid Assassination", "Sabotage", "Restore History").
  - 21 **Patch Cards**: Used to repair paradoxes on Ripplepoint cards. Playing a Patch grants an extra card draw.
  - 15 **Artifact Cards**: Represent collectible items from history. Played face-up in front of the player.
  - 14 **Action Cards**: One-time effects (e.g., "Sell Artifact", "New Mission", "Your Parents Never Met").
  - 10 **Temporal Rift Cards**: Powerful time-altering effects with restrictions (e.g., "Message from Your Future Self", "Fast Forward").
- **10 Mission Cards**
- **14 Identity Cards**

### 3. Setup

1. **Arrange the Timeline**:
   - Place the 32 Timeline cards in an 8×4 grid, following the row-column index (temporal index) in the lower-left corner.
   - All cards start face-up on their "real history" side:
     - Linchpins: Purple side (original event).
     - Ripplepoints: Blue side (normal outcome).

2. **Deal Player Cards**:
   - Shuffle the Mission and Identity decks separately.
   - Deal one **Mission Card** and one **Identity Card** to each player. These are kept secret.
   - Return unused Mission and Identity cards to the box.

3. **Deal Starting Hands**:
   - Shuffle the 80-card game deck (Inverters, Patches, Artifacts, Actions, Temporal Rifts).
   - Deal **3 cards** to each player.
   - Place the remaining deck in the center as the draw pile.
   - Place a discard pile next to it.

4. **Determine First Player**:
   - All players close their eyes and guess the current time.
   - The player whose guess is closest to the actual time goes first.

5. **Appoint the Timekeeper (optional)**:
   - One player may take on the role of **Timekeeper**, responsible for ensuring timeline changes are correctly applied.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

On a player’s turn, follow this sequence:

1. **Draw 1 Card** from the draw pile.
2. **Play 1 Card** from your hand, or **Discard 1 Card** if you cannot or choose not to play.

#### Card Types and Effects:

- **Inverter**:
  - Discard the card.
  - Flip a Linchpin card to its alternate side (red 'prime' version).
  - Check all Ripplepoint cards for changes: flip any that now meet paradox conditions (based on icons and logic: "OR" or "AND").
  - Restore any paradoxes that no longer meet conditions (flip back to blue side).

- **Patch**:
  - Play only on a Ripplepoint card currently showing a paradox (tear side).
  - Cover the paradox with the Patch card.
  - **Draw 1 extra card** immediately.
  - Some Patches (e.g., 1945, 1962) have special conditions or effects.

- **Artifact**:
  - Play face-up in front of you.
  - Represents collecting that item from history.

- **Action**:
  - Follow the instructions (e.g., "Sell Artifact", "New Mission").
  - Discard after resolving.

- **Temporal Rift**:
  - Powerful effects with restrictions:
    - **Message from Your Future Self**: Can be played **out of turn** to cancel another player’s card.
    - **Fast Forward**: Take two additional turns in a row.
    - **Rewind** / **Fast Forward to the Future**: Let you draw and play cards from the discard pile or future draw pile.
  - Cannot be retrieved via Rewind or Fast Forward to the Future.

#### "Killing Time" Option:
- If you discard instead of playing a card, you may **discard a second card and draw one** to replace it.

#### End of Turn:
- Check victory conditions (see below).

#### Draw Pile Depletion:
- When the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile (except Temporal Rifts that cannot be retrieved) to form a new draw pile.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Timeline Mechanics:
- **Linchpins**: Flippable pivotal events. Each has a list of years ("Cascades") that may be affected.
- **Ripplepoints**: Dependent events. Flip to paradox side when their condition is met.
  - **"OR" Condition**: Flip if **any** linked Linchpin is altered.
  - **"AND" Condition**: Flip only when **all** linked Linchpins are altered.
- **Icons**: Each Linchpin has a unique icon. Ripplepoints show small versions of these icons to indicate dependencies.
- **Prime Notation (')**: Altered Linchpins and their icons are marked with a prime (') to denote changed state.

#### Paradoxes:
- Created when a Ripplepoint’s condition is met.
- Must be patched to stabilize the timeline.
- A Patch may be **nullified** if its "Playable If" condition is no longer true.

#### Special Rules:
- **1945 (Nexus)**: Can become a paradox from three different Linchpins. Has three possible Patch cards. Patches are "unstable"—check "Playable If" conditions when playing.
- **1962 (Megaparadox)**: If the "WWIII" Patch is played, all Timeline cards after 1962 are **inaccessible** (slide them down on the table). Victory via Identity is impossible if any required year is after 1962.
- **Message from Your Future Self**:
  - Can be played **at any time** to cancel another player’s card.
  - Only cancels the **most recently played** card.
  - Cannot cancel a victory declaration.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Victory Conditions (check at the end of your turn):

1. **Complete Your Mission**:
   - The three **Artifacts** shown on your **Mission Card** must be played face-up in front of you.

2. **Return Home (Identity Victory)**:
   - The three years on your **Identity Card** must appear on the Timeline **as specified**:
     - Black year: Linchpin in original (purple) state.
     - Red years: Linchpins in altered (red prime) state, and their corresponding Ripplepoints must be **patched** (not just paradoxed).
   - **Note**: If a required year is paradoxed but not patched, you cannot win.

3. **Hand Size Victory**:
   - You must have **exactly 10 cards in hand** at the end of your turn.
   - Does **not** include Mission, Identity, or Artifact cards on the table.
   - You must **gain a card during your turn** (via Patch, Sell Artifact, etc.) to win this way. Simply drawing to 10 is not enough.

#### Loss Condition:
- If the **13th paradox** is created (13 Ripplepoints showing tear side), the universe is destroyed.
- **All players lose immediately**.

#### Victory Declaration:
- Announce victory only at the end of your turn.
- Pause briefly after your final action to allow opponents to play **Message from Your Future Self**.
- Once you reveal your Mission or Identity card, it's too late to cancel.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can I win on a previous turn?**  
  No. Victory can only be claimed at the end of your current turn.

- **Can I patch a paradox that’s not mine?**  
  Yes. Any player can patch any paradox.

- **Can I use "Restore History" to flip a Linchpin back?**  
  Yes. "Restore History" and "Gyro del Destino" can flip in either direction. Other Inverters are one-way.

- **Can I win via Identity if a required year is in a paradox?**  
  Only if it is **patched**. A raw paradox is not sufficient.

- **What happens to Patches when their condition is nullified?**  
  They are discarded immediately.

- **Can I use "Rewind" to retrieve a Temporal Rift?**  
  No. Temporal Rifts cannot be retrieved by Rewind or Fast Forward to the Future.

- **Can "Message from Your Future Self" cancel a victory?**  
  No. Once a player reveals their Mission or Identity to claim victory, it cannot be canceled.

- **Multiple Mona Lisas**:  
  Three versions exist. When selling or using Mona Lisa in a mission, use the **most authentic** one currently in play.

- **Changing Mission/Identity**:  
  Cards like "New Mission" or "Your Parents Never Met" let you swap your current card. Discard the old one and draw a new one.
