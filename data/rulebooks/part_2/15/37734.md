### 1. Lore & Objective
In the mountain, there are veins of precious stones. Players act as miners who build tunnels, establish stations in the mountains and cities, discover veins of precious stones, prospect for stones, and sell them. The winner is the player with the most victory points on the scoring track at the end of the game.

### 2. Components
- 1 game board
- 4 scoring markers (in 4 colors)
- 44 stations (mine stations; wooden cubes in 4 colors, 11 per player)
- 62 tunnel tiles (17 six-exit, 19 four-exit, 14 three-exit, 12 two-exit)
- 12 dynamite tiles (tunnel tiles with a red circle: 3 six-exit, 3 four-exit, 3 three-exit, 3 two-exit)
- 18 vein tiles
- 8 option tiles (2 per player)
- 4 prospect tiles (1 per player)
- 4 sequence cards (numbered 1–4)
- 54 precious stones (in 6 colors, 9 per color)
- 15 order cards (6 with 2 stones, 6 with 3 stones, 3 with 4 stones)
- 12 "2" chips

### 3. Setup
1. Place tunnel tiles on the five pre-marked mountain spaces: 1 six-exit and 4 four-exit tiles.
2. Place 1 vein tile on the six-exit tunnel and place all 9 yellow precious stones on it.
3. Place remaining precious stones on their respective color tracks (1–9).
4. Each player receives:
   - 1 scoring marker (placed on space 20 of the scoring track)
   - 1 action board
5. Place in the buy pool:
   - 5 veins
   - 4 six-exit, 3 four-exit, and 2 three-exit tunnel tiles
   - 2 stations per player
6. Place the 4 sequence cards on their designated board spaces.
7. Shuffle order cards and place 5 face-up next to the board.
8. Place "2" chips next to the face-up order cards.
9. Place remaining components in the supply.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game consists of 3 phases. Each phase has 4 sections:
1. **Bid for Sequence Cards, Take Tiles, Take Order Cards**
2. **Build (Perform 12 Actions)**
3. **City Scoring and Explosion**
4. **Sell Precious Stones and Deliver Orders**

After each phase, return sequence cards, reveal 5 new order cards (adding to unclaimed ones), and begin the next phase. The player who had the lowest sequence card in the previous phase starts the bidding.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Sequence Card Auction
- Players bid victory points (VP) to choose sequence cards, determining turn order.
- The highest bidder selects a card, pays their bid in VP (moves scoring marker backward), and the next player starts a new auction for remaining cards.
- A bid of "0" is allowed.
- In phases 2 and 3, the player with the lowest sequence card from the prior phase starts the auction.

#### Taking Tiles
- Each player takes from the supply:
  - 4 tunnel tiles (1 six-exit, 1 four-exit, 1 three-exit, 1 two-exit)
  - 1 vein
  - 2 option tiles
  - 1 prospect tile
  - 3 stations
  - 1 dynamite tile (type determined by sequence card)

#### Taking Order Cards
- Players take order cards in sequence card order (lowest to highest).
- After all players have taken a card or passed, additional rounds occur until all pass or all cards are taken.
- Unclaimed order cards receive a "2" chip. When taken in a later phase, the player immediately gains 2 VP.

#### Performing 12 Actions
- Players take turns in sequence card order.
- On each turn, a player performs 1–4 actions (minimum 1, maximum 4 per turn).
- Total of 12 actions per player per phase.
- Actions may be skipped by discarding the corresponding component to the buy pool (still counts as an action).
- The prospect action must be the 12th and final action.

**Action Types:**
1. **Lay Tunnel/Dynamite Tile**
   - Must be placed adjacent to an existing tile or on top of another tunnel/dynamite tile.
   - Must continue at least one existing tunnel path.
   - Can only be placed adjacent to a vein if another tunnel already connects to it.
   - Can only be placed on top of another tile if:
     - Upper tile has more exits than the lower.
     - At least one tunnel on the upper tile connects to an adjacent tile.
   - Can be placed adjacent to a city space only if:
     - The player has a station in that city, OR
     - The new tunnel extends an existing route from the mountains.

2. **Build Station**
   - **In mountains:** On a level-1 tunnel tile (directly on board) just placed by the same player in the same turn. Cannot be built on a dynamite tile.
   - **In city:** Only if there is an uninterrupted path via tunnels to one of the player’s mountain stations. The path may pass through the player’s other city stations.
   - Only one station per city hex; multiple stations allowed per city area.

3. **Discover Vein**
   - Place a vein tile on any tunnel or dynamite tile.
   - Cannot be adjacent to a city space or another vein.
   - Place 4 stones of one color (3 in a 2-player game) from the lowest-numbered available spaces on that color’s track.
   - Vein acts as a 6-exit tile; does not interrupt connections.
   - When the last stone is taken, remove the vein to the buy pool and reveal the underlying tunnel.

4. **Use Option Tile**
   - Return option tile to supply.
   - Either:
     - Take one component (tunnel, vein, dynamite, station) from the buy pool and use it immediately, OR
     - Gain 3 VP (move scoring marker forward).
   - Entire process counts as one action.

5. **Prospect**
   - Must be the 12th action.
   - Requires an uninterrupted path between two of the player’s own stations (mountain or city).
   - Collect one stone from each vein crossed.
   - Each tile (tunnel, vein, station) may be passed only once.
   - Cannot pass through opponent’s stations.
   - After prospecting, return the prospect tile to the supply.

#### City Scoring
- Each player scores for stations in cities that are connected to a mountain station of the same color.
- Score equals the number of empty spaces in that city (including unconnected stations, which count as empty).
- All five cities are scored separately.

#### Explosion
- All visible dynamite tiles explode.
- Remove:
  - The dynamite tile
  - All tiles underneath it
  - All adjacent tiles (only the top tile if stacked), except those with a station or vein on them
- Chain reactions occur if removing adjacent tiles reveals another dynamite tile.
- Each dynamite tile is resolved independently.

#### Selling Precious Stones
1. **Color Sale (per color, starting with yellow, clockwise)**
   - Player with lowest sequence card starts.
   - Players bid in sequence card order.
   - Each bid must be lower than the previous.
   - Only the player with the lowest bid may sell that color.
   - Must sell at least one stone; may sell more at the winning bid price.
   - Stones sold are placed on the highest empty spaces of that color’s track.
   - If no one bids, no sale occurs for that color.

2. **Order Card Sale**
   - Players sell fulfilled order cards in sequence card order.
   - Return required stones to the highest empty spaces on their color tracks.
   - Gain VP as shown on the top of the card.
   - Unfulfilled order cards remain in front of the player.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
After the 3rd phase:
1. **Final City Scoring:** Score cities one last time.
2. **Penalty for Unfulfilled Orders:** For each unfulfilled order card, lose VP as shown on the bottom of the card.
3. **Final Sale:**
   - All players reveal remaining stones.
   - Starting with the last player on the scoring track (lowest sequence card breaks ties), each player sells one stone at a time.
   - The seller chooses any stone, places it on the highest empty space of its color track, and gains that many VP.
   - Repeat until all stones are sold.
- The game ends after the final sale.
- The player with the most VP wins. Tiebreaker: lowest sequence card.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Hidden Information:** Only stones acquired during prospecting are kept face down.
- **Tunnel Placement Next to City:** Allowed only if extending an existing tunnel route, or if the player has a station in that city hex.
- **Station on Tunnel Tile:** Prevents other players from using that tile for prospecting or connections but does not block tunnel extension.
- **Prospecting Route:** Must start and end at different stations of the same player; only one route per phase; no tile may be crossed twice.
- **Dynamite Explosion:** Does not destroy adjacent veins or stations. Dynamite tiles do not destroy each other but explode independently.
