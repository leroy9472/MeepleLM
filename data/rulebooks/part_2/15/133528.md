## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
City of Remnants is a competitive strategy board game set in a dystopian future where rival gangs battle for control of a ruined city. Players lead gangs, expanding influence through recruitment, development, and combat, while fending off Yugai Control Units (YCU). The goal is to earn the most renown by controlling valuable areas, completing developments, and acquiring black market cards. The game ends when the renown pool is exhausted during the Award Renown Phase. The player with the highest renown wins; ties are broken by ARC wealth.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Actions  
Each turn, choose one action:

- **Recruit**  
  - Select a faceup gang member card  
  - Declare intent to recruit  
  - Other players (with turns remaining) may bid in clockwise order  
  - Bidding: minimum raise any amount; pass to exit  
  - Winner pays bid, recruits gang member:  
    - Add card to hand  
    - Place one figure in gang member pool  
    - Advance turn tracker +1 (even if not your turn)  
  - If declarer is outbid: continue recruiting until successful  
  - No faceup cards? Reveal top of deck and attempt to recruit it  

- **Buy**  
  - Purchase one faceup black market card by paying ARC cost; add to hand  
  - Cannot buy if no faceup cards  
  - **Also during Buy action**: Buy renown tokens at 3,000 ARCs each  
    - May buy up to influence value per Buy action  

- **Produce >> Develop**  
  - Activate "Produce >> Develop" abilities on controlled developments (e.g., gain product tokens)  
  - Build new development:  
    - Pay ARC cost  
    - Place tile on empty spaces matching level (Slums/Midtown/Heights)  
    - May place on spaces with figures (move figures onto tile)  
  - **Control requirement**: Must have at least one figure on every space the tile occupies to control it  

- **Sell**  
  - Discard up to influence number of product tokens from controlled developments  
  - Gain ARCs as specified on development tiles  

- **Refresh**  
  - Discard any number of cards  
  - Shuffle discard pile into draw pile  
  - Draw up to influence number of cards  

- **Move**  
  - Move up to influence number of figures  
  - Each figure may move up to 3 spaces  
  - Movement rules:  
    - Orthogonal only (no diagonal)  
    - Cannot end on space with 2+ of your figures  
    - Moving from gang pool to entry space = 1 space used  
    - Entering enemy-occupied space stops movement  
    - May not move through multiple enemy spaces in one turn  
  - After action: Battle in any contested space (multiple players or YCU present)  

#### Battling  

- **Battling Another Player**  
  - Attacker (current player) lays down up to influence number of cards face down (from hand or top of draw pile; no peeking at draw pile cards)  
  - Defender does the same  
  - Reveal attacker’s cards → trigger Battle abilities  
  - Reveal defender’s cards → trigger Battle abilities  
  - Roll battle dice:  
    - Number of dice = number of figures in contested space + orthogonally adjacent spaces  
  - Total attack = dice roll + card attack value (color-dependent)  
  - Higher total wins; tie → defender wins  
  - Repeat battle if space remains contested  

- **Battling YCU**  
  - Total YCU attack value = sum of all YCU tokens in space  
  - Choose order if multiple YCUs  
  - Lay down up to influence cards face down, reveal  
  - Roll dice based on your figures in contested + adjacent spaces  
  - Total attack = dice + card attack values  
  - If ≥ YCU attack value: defeat YCU → return to bag, roll d6, consult YCU alert card  
  - If < YCU attack value: lose battle (see Defeat)  

- **Defeat (in any battle)**  
  - Remove one figure from contested space to unused pool  
  - Remove one gang member card from game (reveal to all):  
    1. If played in battle → remove one of those  
    2. Else → remove from discard pile  
    3. Else → remove from hand or search draw pile (shuffle after)  

#### Gaining Influence  
- Conditions listed on player mat (e.g., control X developments, have Y figures)  
- Announce when condition met; advance influence marker +1  
- Influence is permanent  
- Each condition can only be triggered once

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End**: Triggered during Award Renown Phase if not enough renown tokens to distribute  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  1. All earned renown (awarded and unclaimed) added to total  
  2. Each black market card in possession = 1 renown  
  3. Sum:  
     - Renown tokens held  
     - Unclaimed renown from final round  
     - +1 per black market card  
- **Victory**: Highest total wins  
- **Tiebreaker**: Most ARCs

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I bribe YCU during Yugai Patrol Phase only?**  
  Yes — only when YCU is placed on your figure or during battle resolution in that phase.  

- **What if I have no cards to play in battle?**  
  You still roll dice based on figure count. If defeated, remove a card from discard/hand/draw pile per defeat rules.  

- **Can I move a figure from gang pool to board and then move it further?**  
  No — moving from pool to entry space uses 1 of its 3 movement points. You may move it up to 2 more spaces.  

- **Can I build a development on a space with enemy figures?**  
  No — you must control the space (have figure(s) there), but developments can only be placed on empty spaces (no existing developments). Figures may occupy space, but not other developments.  

- **Can I sell more products than my influence if I have multiple developments?**  
  No — maximum number of products you can sell = current influence, regardless of holdings.  

- **Do I gain influence before or after performing actions?**  
  Immediately when condition is met, at any time. Higher influence affects card draws, movement, and battle limits from that point forward.  

- **Can I refresh more than once per turn?**  
  No — only one action per turn. Refresh is an action, so limited to once per turn.
