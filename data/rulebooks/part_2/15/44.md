## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
David & Goliath is a strategic card game where strength and cunning compete. High-value cards dominate play but can be risky, while low-value cards are weak in contest but can yield powerful rewards. The objective is to accumulate the most points by the end of the game through smart card play and efficient collection of cards in colors with limited representation.

2. Components  
- 90 playing cards, divided into 5 colors (red, yellow, green, blue, violet)  
- Cards numbered from 1 to 18 in each color (exact range used depends on player count)  
- 5 instruction cards (included in box, for reference)  

3. Setup  
- Determine number of players (3–6).  
- Remove unused cards based on player count:  
  - 3 players: Use cards 1–9 in each color (45 cards total)  
  - 4 players: Use cards 1–12 in each color (60 cards total)  
  - 5 players: Use cards 1–15 in each color (75 cards total)  
  - 6 players: Use all 90 cards (1–18 in each color)  
- Shuffle the remaining deck.  
- Deal 15 cards to each player. All players hold their cards in hand.  
- The player to the dealer’s left starts.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each of the 15 rounds proceeds as follows:  
1. The starting player leads by playing any card face up in front of them.  
2. Play proceeds clockwise. Each player must follow suit (match the color of the first card played) if possible.  
3. If a player cannot follow suit, they may play any card of any color.  
4. After all players have played one card:  
   a. Determine the highest card:  
      - The card with the highest number wins.  
      - If tied, the last-played card of that value is considered highest.  
   b. Determine the lowest card:  
      - The card with the lowest number wins.  
      - If tied, the last-played card of that value is considered lowest.  
   c. Award cards:  
      - The player who played the lowest card takes the highest card as profit.  
      - The player who played the highest card takes all other remaining cards (i.e., all cards except the highest and lowest) as profit.  
5. Profits are placed face up beside each player, sorted by color. Individual cards must remain visible.  
6. The player who played the highest card becomes the starter for the next round.  
7. Repeat for 15 rounds until all players have played all their cards.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Suit Following: The first card played sets the color; others must follow if able.  
- Trick Resolution: Each round is a trick. The highest and lowest cards trigger dual rewards:  
  - Lowest card wins the highest card (a key tactical opportunity).  
  - Highest card wins all other cards in the trick.  
- Turn Passing: The winner of the highest card leads the next trick.  
- Visibility: All won cards must be kept face up and sorted by color for scoring transparency.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After 15 rounds, all cards have been played and collected.  
- Scoring is done color by color (in order: red, yellow, green, blue, violet).  
- For each color:  
  - If a player has 1 or 2 cards: score face value of each card.  
  - If a player has 3 or more cards: score 1 point per card, regardless of value.  
- Sum points across all five colors for total score.  
- The player with the highest total score wins.  
- Note: There is one full game of 15 rounds. The phrase “as many rounds as players” in the source appears to be a translation error; gameplay confirms exactly 15 rounds are played.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: What if two players play the same highest number?  
  A: The one who played it last (most recently) is considered the highest.  
- Q: What if two players play the same lowest number?  
  A: The one who played it last is considered the lowest.  
- Q: Can a player choose not to follow suit if they can?  
  A: No. Following suit is mandatory when possible.  
- Q: What happens to the highest card when it is won by the lowest-card player?  
  A: It is added to their profit pile, still visible and sorted by color.  
- Q: Does the player who wins the highest card via lowest-play still lead next round?  
  A: No. Only the player who originally played the highest card leads the next round.  
- Q: Are cards won during the game playable later?  
  A: No. Players only play the 15 cards they were dealt. Won cards are for scoring only.
