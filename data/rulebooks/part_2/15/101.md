## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix is a racing card game where players act as investors bidding on race cars before each race. Using a shared deck of movement and switch cards, players influence the movement of cars around a track. The goal is to strategically bid and play cards to get your cars across the finish line in top positions to earn prize money. The player with the most money after three races wins.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with race track  
- Six car identification (bidding) cards (yellow, blue, green, black, red, orange)  
- Movement cards (including six colored 10s and one white 10)  
- Switch cards (swap car movement effects)  
- Money ($10,000, $20,000, $50,000, $100,000 denominations)  
- Banker role (manages money)

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose a banker to distribute $200,000 to each player.  
2. Choose the first dealer.  
3. Remove from the deck:  
   - Six car bidding cards (cars #50–#55)  
   - Seven 10-count movement cards (one per color + white)  
4. Shuffle the six bidding cards and place them face down as a deck.  
5. Set aside the six colored 10-count movement cards (one per car color). The white 10 is removed from play unless using a variant.  
6. Shuffle the remaining movement and switch cards and deal them evenly among players. Some may have one extra card.  
7. For Downforce variant: Deal an even number of cards and discard the rest.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
#### Bidding for Cars  
1. Turn over the top bidding card to reveal the first car for auction.  
2. Bidding starts with the dealer and proceeds clockwise.  
   - Bids increase in $10,000 increments.  
   - A player may pass; once passed, they cannot re-enter bidding for that car.  
   - A player may not bid more than their available cash.  
3. Maximum car ownership:  
   - 2-player game: max 3 cars per player  
   - 3–5 player game: max 2 cars per player  
   - 6-player game: each player owns exactly 1 car  
4. When only one player remains in bidding, they win:  
   - Pay the bid amount to the bank  
   - Place the car in the next available pole position (#1, #2, etc.)  
   - Place the bidding card face-up in front of them  
   - Add the matching colored 10-count movement card to their hand  
5. Next auction starts with the player to the left of the last buyer.  
6. Special rules:  
   - If only one player lacks a car when the last car is auctioned, they must buy it for $10,000.  
   - If no one bids on a car, place its bidding card at the bottom of the deck and continue. When re-auctioned, if still unclaimed, place the car on track normally; its 10-count card is out of play.  
7. After all cars are placed, players sit clockwise from pole position #1, using the highest-positioned car if owning multiple.

#### Running the Race  
1. The owner of the car in pole position #1 plays first. Play proceeds clockwise.  
2. On a turn, a player must play one card:  
   - Movement card  
   - Switch card  
3. **Movement Cards**:  
   - Move cars in the order listed (top to bottom).  
   - Each listed car must move the full number of spaces unless blocked.  
   - Movement is forward only: straight or diagonal (lane change).  
   - Cars cannot move sideways, backward, or over others.  
   - No two cars may occupy the same space.  
   - White (wild) symbol:  
     - Choose any car not listed elsewhere on the card.  
     - The chosen car must be able to move the full number of spaces.  
     - Cannot be used for a car that has already finished.  
4. **Switch Cards**:  
   - Swap the movement effects of the two shown colors until the end of the player’s next turn.  
   - Example: Black ↔ Yellow means any movement for black now applies to yellow, and vice versa.  
   - The swap applies even if only one color appears on a card.  
5. A player must play a card every turn, even after all their cars finish.  
6. If a player believes they cannot play any card:  
   - They must reveal their hand.  
   - If any card is playable, they must play it.  
   - Otherwise, play passes to the next player.  
7. The race ends when:  
   - All cars have crossed the finish line, or  
   - All players have played all their cards  
   Whichever occurs first.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Play Order**: Strict clockwise turn order.  
- **Movement Constraints**: Full movement required unless blocked.  
- **White (Wild) Use**: Flexible but restricted:  
  - Cannot be same color as any on card  
  - Must be able to move full distance  
- **Switch Cards**: Temporary color swap (lasts until end of next turn).  
- **Blocking**: Cars block movement if in the path; diagonal moves allowed to navigate.  
- **Finish Line**: Crossing counts as finishing; partial movement beyond is allowed.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- After the race, cars are ranked by order they cross the finish line:  
  - 1st: $200,000  
  - 2nd: $150,000  
  - 3rd: $100,000  
  - 4th: $75,000  
  - 5th: $40,000  
  - 6th: $30,000  
- Cars that do not finish earn $0.  
- Banker pays prize money to car owners. Unclaimed prize money stays in the bank.  
- After scoring:  
  - If not the third race:  
    - Collect all movement and switch cards  
    - Shuffle and redistribute  
    - Start new bidding for next race  
  - Winner of previous race becomes dealer and starts bidding  
- Game ends after three races. Player with the most money wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a player own multiple cars?**  
  Yes, within player count limits.  
- **What if no one bids on a car?**  
  Card goes to bottom of deck. When re-auctioned, if still unbid, car is placed on track but its 10-count card is inactive.  
- **Can the white wild move a finished car?**  
  No. Finished cars cannot be moved.  
- **Can a switch card affect a car not on the current movement card?**  
  Yes. The color swap is global and lasts until end of next turn.  
- **What if a car is blocked and cannot move its full amount?**  
  It does not move at all.  
- **Can I suggest how my car is moved?**  
  Yes, but you cannot dictate movement—player playing the card decides path, as long as movement rules are followed.  
- **Tournament Seating**: Players sit clockwise from #1 pole position, using highest-positioned car if owning multiple.
