# 1861: The Railways of the Russian Empire — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Set in Tsarist Russia prior to the Bolshevik Revolution, 1861 simulates the development of the Russian railway network. Players act as investors, acquiring private and minor railway companies, forming and investing in public railway companies, and building track to generate revenue. The game ends either with the purchase of the first 8-train or when the bank runs out of money. Players' wealth is calculated from their cash and stock holdings at the end of the game; the richest player wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game alternates between:
- **Stock Rounds**: Players auction companies and buy/sell stock.
- **Operating Rounds (OR)**: Companies operate in order: Private → Minor → Public → RSR (if active).
- **Merger Rounds**: After each OR in Phases 3–7, Minor Companies may convert or merge into Public Companies.

Sequence:  
Stock Round → OR1 → Merger Round → OR2 → Merger Round → Stock Round → ... → End Game.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Corporate Entities
- **Private Companies (5)**: Fixed revenue at start of each OR. Owned by players, companies, or RSR. May be sold by players from Phase 3 onward (R1–face value). Nationalized at Phase 6.
- **Minor Companies (16)**: Fully owned by one player (Director). Auctioned in Stock Rounds. Operate before Public Companies. May merge or convert from Phase 3. Nationalized at Phase 8.
- **Public Companies (8)**: Share-based (1 × 20% Director’s cert, 8 × 10% certs). Director is majority shareholder. No player may own >60%. May be started from Phase 4.
- **Russian State Railway (RSR)**: No shares. Operates in Phases 4–7. Automatically buys cheapest train if possible. Nationalized companies’ assets go to RSR.

#### Stock Round
- **Order**: Priority Deal holder → clockwise.
- **Actions per turn**:
  1. Sell any number of certificates (subject to limits).
  2. Then: Buy one certificate **or** auction a Minor Company.
- **Selling Rules**:
  - Cannot sell Private or Minor Companies.

  - Max 50% of any company’s shares in Bank Pool.
  - Director’s Certificates cannot go to Bank Pool.
  - If Director sells, stock price drops one row.

  - Winner pays to Minor’s treasury.
  - Stock price = half bid (rounded down to R50–R135).
  - Place Station Marker in reserved hex.
- **Certificate Limit**:
  - 3p: 21, 4p: 16, 5p: 13, 6p: 11.
  - Includes Private, Minor, and Public certs.
  - Cannot buy or auction if at limit.
- **First Stock Round**:
  - Auction Privates in order: Tsarskoye Selo → Warsaw-Vienna.
  - Min. bid reduces by R5 if all pass; R0 → free.
  - After Warsaw-Vienna, auction Nikolaev (N); then other Minors.
- **End of Stock Round**:
  - All players pass consecutively.
  - If 100% of a Public Company is in player hands, stock price rises one row (or diagonally if at top).
  - Priority Deal passes to left of last active player.
  - Advance Round Marker to OR1.

#### Operating Round
Order: Privates → Minors (by stock price, rightmost first) → Publics (same) → RSR.

Each company performs (optional actions in order):
1. **Redeem Stock**: Buy back shares from Bank Pool at current price. No loans allowed.
2. **Lay or Upgrade Track**:
   - One tile operation per turn (lay yellow or upgrade).
   - Second operation: R20 fee; only one may be upgrade.
   - Cannot lay and upgrade same tile in one turn.
   - Yellow: Phase 2+; Green: Phase 3+; Brown: Phase 5+; Grey: Phase 6+.
   - Rules for tile placement: match city type, pay terrain costs, extend route (except home hex).
3. **Place Station Marker**:
   - One per OR.
   - Must be on route.
   - Cost: R20 × hex distance (2nd marker); R40 × distance (3rd, to nearest marker).
   - Cannot use loans to pay.
   - Reserved spaces: Minor home hexes (pre-Phase 5), RSR (St. Petersburg, Moscow).
4. **Run Trains**:
   - Each train on separate route; routes may cross but not share track.
   - Must visit ≥2 cities/off-boards; ≤ train number of stops.
   - Value = sum of visited cities/off-boards.
   - Off-board values increase by phase.
   - Ekaterinburg: R80 if route includes Moscow; else R40.
   - $5+5\mathrm{E}$: counts any 5 cities, then doubles.
   - $2+2$: same as 2-train, then doubles value.
5. **Distribute Earnings**:
   - **Minor**: 50% to owner, 50% to treasury.
   - **Public**: Choose: 0%, 50% (rounded up), or 100% dividend.
     - Dividend paid to shareholders (treasury shares → company; Bank Pool → lost).
   - **RSR**: All earnings to treasury.
6. **Stock Price Adjustment**:
   - **Minor**:
     - 0 earnings → left/down.
     - Paid → right/up (max in yellow column; then up).
   - **Public**:
     - 0 or retained earnings → left/down.
     - Dividend ≥10× price/share → right/up.
   - Move to bottom of stack if space occupied.
7. **Pay Loan Interest**: R5 per loan held at start of turn. Paid immediately upon taking loan.
8. **Redeem Loans**: Must repay as many as possible if ≥R50 in treasury.
9. **Purchase Trains**:
   - May buy if under train limit.
   - Sources: Bank (face value), Bank Pool (face value), or other company (R1–treasury).
   - May buy multiple, but effects apply immediately.
   - **Must buy train if none**:
     - May buy from another company (consent).
     - Else: must buy from Bank/Pool, using loans if needed.
     - If cannot afford even with max loans → nationalized.
   - **RSR**: Buys cheapest train if possible; may take loans.

#### Merger Round (Phases 3–7)
After each OR, eligible Minors may convert or merge.

- **Convert**:
  - Minor stock price must be R100–R165.
  - New Public Company price = Minor price (set in brown/purple zone).
  - Director gets 20% cert.
  - Assets transferred.
- **Merge**:
  - 2–10 Minors (≤6 per player).
  - Must be connected by legal route (merging markers don’t block).
  - New price = sum of highest and lowest Minor prices (≤R200).
  - Each Minor → one share in new Public Company.
  - Director = player with most shares (tie: earliest operating Minor).
  - Director chooses 2 markers to replace (cannot take two in same hex).
- **Forming New Company**:
  - All assets (including loans) transferred.
  - Share price set in R70–R200 (red/purple).
  - Shareholders (in order: Director → left) may buy up to 6 shares total.
  - If no one has 2 shares, merger invalid.
  - Then all players (Director → left) may buy one share.
  - Minor markers removed from Stock Market.

#### Nationalisation
Occurs when:
- Phase 4/6: Minor has no train after 2-/3-trains rust.
- Phase 6: All Privates nationalized.
- Phase 8: All Minors nationalized.
- Company has no train and cannot afford one.
- Company cannot pay loan interest.
- Director may voluntarily nationalize Public Company at Phase 4/6/8 if no train.

**Process**:
- Pay off as many loans as possible.
- Stock price: left/down once, plus once per remaining loan.
- Pay shareholders adjusted price (Minors = 2 shares).
- Assets (trains, Privates, money) go to RSR; loans discarded.
- RSR replaces tokens (max 1 per hex; max 6 outside Moscow/St. Petersburg).
- RSR uses available tokens; else remove.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Trigger**:
  - First 8-train purchase.
    - If in OR1: finish OR1, then 2 more ORs (no SR).
    - Else: finish current OR, do SR, then 3 more ORs.
  - Or: Bank runs out of money → end after current OR.
- **Final Adjustments**:
  - Stock price: left/down once per outstanding loan.
  - Privates: worth face value.
  - Minors: worth 2× current stock price.
- **Scoring**:
  - Player wealth = cash + value of all stock (at final prices).
  - Company assets (treasury, trains) do not count.
- **Winner**: Richest player.
