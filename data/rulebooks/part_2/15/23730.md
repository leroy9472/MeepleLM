## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players represent divine forces influencing emerging civilizations across a fragmented world. The goal is to gain influence by spreading followers, building religious structures, and guiding cultural development. The player with the most victory points (VPs) at the end of the game wins.

---

### 2. Components  
- Start tile (marked with a star)  
- Triangular tiles (with symbols: swords, cups, wheat, pyramids, temples)  
- Victory point (VP) chips  
- Civilization disks (large colored disks, one per color)  
- Follower cubes (small colored cubes, matching civilization colors)  
- Scoring tokens (3 per player, shaped like cups)  
- Supply area (for holding available components)

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the **start tile** in the center of the play area.  
2. Each player takes **3 cup-shaped scoring tokens**.  
3. Place all **VP chips** in a supply stack beside the board.  
4. Shuffle all **triangular tiles** face-down into a draw stack.  
5. Place all **civilization disks** and **follower cubes** in the supply area.  
6. Each player draws **2 tiles** to form their initial hand.  
   - If a player draws an **EPOCH tile**, reveal it, trigger EPOCH scoring immediately, return the tile, and draw a replacement. Repeat until no EPOCH tiles are in starting hands.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds clockwise. On a turn, each player performs the following steps in order:

1. **Play a Tile** – Place or replace a tile from hand.  
2. **Start Civilization or Take Follower** – Choose one action.  
3. **(Optional) Play Scoring Token** – Trigger cup-based scoring.  
4. **Draw Replacement Tile** – Draw to maintain 2 tiles in hand.  

After step 4, if an **EPOCH tile** is drawn:
- Reveal it. All players score in an **Epoch round**.
- Discard the EPOCH tile and draw again.
- Repeat until a non-EPOCH tile is drawn; add it to hand.
- Then pass turn to next player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### 1. Play a Tile  
You may either **place** a new tile or **replace** an existing one.

**Placing a Tile:**  
- Attach it edge-to-edge with existing tiles.  
- If placement connects two or more continents, check for **War** or **Migration**.  
  - If either occurs, you must **discard 1 follower cube (any color)** as a cost.  
- If the tile has a **Temple**, score immediately upon connecting it to a continent (see Scoring: Temples).

**Replacing a Tile:**  
- You may replace any tile **except one with a Pyramid**.  
- Replacement often causes **War**, **Migration**, or both.  
  - If so, you must **discard 1 follower cube (any color)**.  
- The replaced tile is removed from the board and goes back to the supply or bag.

> **Note:** An **Island** consists of only two tile shores and is not a continent. Continents must have at least three connected sides.

---

#### 2. Start Civilization or Take Follower  

**Option A: Start a New Civilization**  
- Choose a **civilization color** still available in the supply.  
- Place its **large disk** on any **unoccupied continent** (only one civilization per continent).  
- If the continent has **wheat symbols**, gain **1 follower cube per wheat** symbol.

**Option B: Take a Follower Cube**  
- Take **1 follower cube** (any color) from the supply and place it in front of you.  
- These followers are used during **Cup** and **Epoch** scoring phases.

---

#### 3. Optional – Play Scoring Token (Cup)  
- You may play **one** of your **cup tokens** this turn.  
- When played, **only you** score during this Cup Scoring round.  
- Score: For each **civilization color** you have followers in, calculate:  
  **(Number of your follower cubes in hand) × (Total cups on that civilization’s continent)**  
- Collect VP chips accordingly.  
- Discard the used cup token. You have 3 total; once used, they’re gone.

---

#### 4. Draw Replacement Tile  
- Draw 1 tile to restore your hand to **2 tiles**.  
- If you draw an **EPOCH tile**:  
  a) Reveal it to all players.  
  b) Trigger **Epoch Scoring** (all players score).  
  c) Discard the EPOCH tile.  
  d) Draw another tile.  
  e) Repeat if another EPOCH tile is drawn.  
- Once a non-EPOCH tile is drawn, add it to your hand and end your turn.

### Scoring Details  

#### 1. Temples  
- Scored **immediately** when a temple tile is placed and connects to a continent.  
- Formula:  
  **(Matching symbol count on the continent) × 1 VP per symbol**  
  - Example: A red (sword) temple connects to a continent with 3 swords → 3 VP.  
- Temples do **not** count as sword/cup/wheat for other purposes.

#### 2. Cup Scoring  
- Triggered when a player plays a **cup scoring token**.  
- Only the **active player** scores.  
- For each civilization you have followers in:  
  **(Your follower cubes) × (Total cups on that continent)** = VP earned  
- Sum across all civilizations you influence.

#### 3. Epoch Scoring  
- Triggered when any player draws an **EPOCH tile** during step 4.  
- **All players** score.  
- For each civilization you have followers in:  
  **(Your follower cubes) × (Total pyramids on that continent)** = VP earned  
- Sum across all civilizations.

---

### War  
- Triggered when tile placement or replacement merges two continents that each have a civilization.  
- **Only one civilization** may occupy a continent.  
- Resolve War:  
  - Compare **total sword symbols** on each civilization’s continent **before** merge.  
  - The civilization with **more swords wins**.  
  - **Tie**: Active player chooses which civilization survives.  
- **Loser**: Remove civilization disk and **all its follower cubes** back to supply.  
- **Cost**: The player who triggered the war must **discard 1 follower cube** (any color).

---

### Migration  
- Triggered when **replacing a tile** causes a continent to **split** into two or more parts.  
- The civilization on the **isolated part** must **migrate**.  
- It moves to the new continent with the **most wheat symbols** (using symbols on current tiles).  
- **Tie in wheat**: Active player chooses which continent it joins.  
- **Must choose a continent over an island** (if applicable).  
- **Cost**: The player who caused the migration must **discard 1 follower cube** (any color).

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End Conditions  
The game ends when **either** of the following occurs:  
- **All players have used all 3 of their cup scoring tokens**, OR  
- The **6th EPOCH tile** is drawn in a 2-player game,  
  the **7th** in a 3-player game,  
  the **8th** in a 4-player game.

#### Final Scoring  
After the last turn, conduct **one final Cup Scoring round** — all players score as if a cup token was played.  
- Use the same formula:  
  For each civilization: **(Your follower cubes) × (Cups on continent)**  
- This is **in addition** to any prior scoring.

#### Winning  
The player with the **most total VP chips** wins.  
Tiebreaker: Most unused follower cubes.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I replace a tile with a temple?**  
A: Yes, unless it also has a pyramid. Tiles with **pyramids cannot be replaced**.

**Q: Do temples count toward sword/cup/wheat totals?**  
A: No. Temple symbols are **only for initial scoring** when placed. They do not count for war, migration, or other scoring.

**Q: Can a civilization be on an island?**  
A: No. Civilizations can only be placed on **continents** (at least 3 connected sides). Islands cannot support civilizations.

**Q: What happens if a migration has no valid continent to move to?**  
A: Migration only occurs if a split creates **at least one valid continent**. If all fragments are islands, the civilization is **removed** and returned to supply.

**Q: Can I start a civilization on a continent with another civilization already present?**  
A: No. Only **one civilization per continent**. You may only start on unoccupied continents.

**Q: Do follower cubes need to match the civilization color?**  
A: No. Followers are used as a **generic resource** for scoring. You can use any color cube; they don’t need to match the civilization you're scoring.

**Q: Can I play a scoring token if I have no followers?**  
A: Yes, but you will score 0 points. It still uses up one of your three tokens.

**Q: Are EPOCH tiles reshuffled if depleted?**  
A: No. The number of EPOCH tiles is fixed. Game ends when the threshold (6/7/8) is reached.
