# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The game simulates World War I, beginning in 1914. The Central Powers (Austria-Hungary, Germany, Ottoman Empire) face the Entente Powers (Russia, France, Britain, and later allies). The game ends when one side achieves victory conditions or reaches the round limit.

**Victory Conditions:**
- A side wins when **2 or more powers** of the opposing side suffer a **political collapse**.
- The **Entente also wins** if the Central Powers have not won by the end of the round limit:
  - End of Round 13: Roll 1 die. On 1–2, war ends, Entente wins.
  - End of Round 14: Roll 1 die. On 1–4, war ends, Entente wins.
  - End of Round 15: War ends, Entente wins.

A **political collapse** occurs when a power controls **half or more** of the original IPC value of its capital and regional territories at the end of a round. The collapsed power is removed from the game.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Movement
**Land Units:**
- Infantry, Artillery, Tank: 1 space
- Fighters: 2 spaces
- Must end movement in territory with at least one infantry (army requirement)
- Fighters must end in territory with friendly infantry

**Sea Units:**
- Battleships, Submarines: 1 move
- Transports, Cruisers: 2 moves
- Cruisers: 3 moves
- Units in sea zone with friendly naval base get +1 movement

**Transports:**
- Carry 2 land units (including fighters)
- Require warship support to enter hostile sea zones
- Load/unload: unit spends full movement
- Offload to single territory only

**Rail Movement (1 per round, not Round 1):**
- Move any number of land units between 2 friendly or contested territories
- Max units = lowest IPC value of any territory in route
- Cannot pick up/drop off mid-route

**Neutral Powers:**
- Minor Aligned Powers (e.g., Serbia): Mobilize when first entered by friendly unit
- Minor Neutral Powers: Mobilize when invaded; join opposing side
- Mobilization: 2× IPC value in infantry, 1 artillery

### Combat
**Land Combat Sequence:**
1. Place dice
2. Determine Air Supremacy (Fighters only; 1 round; most remaining wins)
3. Artillery pre-emptive strike vs. amphibious attackers (on 3 or less)
4. Attacking units fire
5. Defending units fire
6. Remove casualties
   - Attacker: 1 Infantry must be last casualty
   - Defender: Transports last (if applicable)

- Combat lasts 1 round unless amphibious
- Optional in already contested territories
- All battles simultaneous

**Sea Combat Sequence:**
1. Attacking units fire or submerge
2. Defending units fire or submerge
3. Remove casualties
4. Attacker chooses: Press on or Break off
   - Submarines may submerge instead of firing
   - Defender may retreat to adjacent friendly sea zone
   - Attacker must retreat if defender survives and has warships

- Sea zones with original controller’s naval base are mined:
  - Roll die for each ship entering: 1 = destroyed (battleship damaged)
- Conclude sea battles before amphibious assault

### Amphibious Assault
- Must clear sea zone first
- Defending artillery pre-strike: roll for each, hit on 3 or less
- Attacking units do not fire in first round
- Battleships that fought in sea combat cannot bombard
- Bombardment: 1 die per offloading unit, hit on 4 or less

### Unit Abilities
- **Battleships:** 2 hits; repair at friendly naval base
- **Submarines:** May submerge; ignore sea combat restrictions
- **Tanks:** Absorb one hit when attacking (not in amphibious assault)
- **Fighters:** Air supremacy promotes all friendly artillery (attack 3→4)

### Income & Economy
- Collect 1 IPC per territory controlled
- +1 IPC for each neutral power adjacent to controlled territory
- Captured capital: gain unspent IPCs and mobilization costs
- Power without capital: no income, cannot mobilize
- Refund IPCs if cannot mobilize purchased units

### Special Rules
**Austria-Hungary:**
- Must attack Serbia on first turn

**Germany:**
- May declare **Unrestricted Submarine Warfare**
  - During British/US income phase, roll for each sub in SZ2, 7, 8
  - On 1–2: deduct 1 IPC from target
  - Triggers US entry if not already at war

**Russia:**
- **Bolshevik Revolution** (optional, from Round 4):
  - Trigger if:
    - 3+ territories adjacent to Moscow controlled by Central Powers
    - 1+ other original Russian territory controlled or contested by Central Powers
    - Moscow controlled by Russia or contested
  - If triggered: Russia exits war, units removed, territories surrendered

**United States:**
- Starts neutral
- Cannot move units out of USA or attack Central sea units
- Enters war if:
  - Attacked by Central Powers
  - Loses income to German submarine raid
  - Round 4 begins

**Industry:**
- Determined by industrial complexes in capital
  - 0 industry: max 1 non-infantry unit per turn
  - 1 industry: max 1 of each unit type per turn
  - 2+ industry: no restrictions
- India: treated as 0 industry

## 6. Scoring & End Game
**Victory:**
- Central Powers win: 2+ Entente powers suffer political collapse
- Entente wins: 2+ Central Powers collapse OR Central fails by round limit
- Political collapse: ≥50% of original homeland IPC value captured or contested

**End of Game Checks:**
- After Ottoman and US turns
- Round 13: 1–2 ends war (Entente win)
- Round 14: 1–4 ends war (Entente win)
- Round 15: war ends (Entente win)

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Mobilizing Minor Powers:** Only on first entry. Colonies do not trigger mobilization.
- **Multinational Forces:** Allies attack/defend together; casualties agreed mutually or opponent chooses.
- **Capturing Territory:** Original owner regains control if liberated (unless capital fallen).
- **Naval Mines:** Roll at end of movement for each ship entering mined zone.
- **Rail Movement:** Cannot be used on Round 1. Max units = lowest IPC in path.
- **Fighter Movement:** Can fly over hostile land; must end in friendly territory with infantry.
- **Battleship Repair:** Free at friendly naval base during Buy & Repair phase.
- **Submerged Submarines:** Cannot fire, but can be hit; removed if no other casualties.
