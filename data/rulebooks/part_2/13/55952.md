### 1. Lore & Objective
Greed, Incorporated is a game of corporate fraud and embezzlement. Players control companies and manipulate accounting to generate personal wealth through severance bonuses when executives are fired during performance downturns. The ultimate goal is to accumulate the most status points by purchasing status symbols with private cash earned from executive firings.

Victory is determined by:
- Most status points at game end.
- Tiebreaker: Player with the most private cash.

**Initial Setup:**
1. Place board in center. Set:
   - Black cubes on colored boxes of good price tracks.
   - Yellow cubes on "N" of all price trend tracks.
   - Black cubes on colored boxes of status symbol price tracks.
2. Sort status symbol cards:
   - Gold and silver into separate face-up stacks, alphabetical (A to I).
3. Place money and goods piles near a designated player.
4. Give each player:
   - A set of player markers (by faction).
   - A player aid.
5. Company assignment:
   - Shuffle company cards 0–4; deal one to each player.
   - Return unused cards (if 3 or 4 players) to box.
   - Place cards 5–9 within reach (for future use).
6. Each player:

   - Receives 100 million in free cash.
   - Places black dollar sign on last year’s income slot.
7. Starting player:
   - Player with lowest-numbered company gets green starting player marker.
8. Adjust price trends:

9. Prepare asset deck:

   - Remove cards marked for player count.
   - Stack in order: 40–49 (bottom), then 30–39, 20–29, 10–19 (top).
   - Shuffle each pile before stacking.
   - Deal 2 cards to each player.
   - Place remainder face-down as draw stack.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each year consists of 10 phases in fixed order:

1. **Announcements**  
   Players simultaneously play an asset card face-down with a player marker. Reveal all. Adjust price trends by summing effects (±1 per card). Draw one card each.

2. **Market Forces**  
   Adjust current prices of all goods based on their price trend markers (e.g., +2 = move black price marker two steps right). Prices cannot exceed printed min/max.

3. **Investments**  
   Companies with <4 assets bid secretly using free cash (min bid: 10 million). Highest bidder chooses first. Ties broken by highest asset number.  
   - If asset has same faction as CEO, company pays double the bid.
   - Unclaimed assets remain on table for future rounds.
   - Companies may pass (pay nothing).
   - Winning bidder places asset on placard, adds player marker to highest available executive slot (CEO → CFO → COO → middle management).

4. **Production**  
   Mandatory: Each company gains one goods card per good shown on its primary producer assets (no arrow icon).  
   After production:
   - Shift primary producer assets to "used".
   - Shift all other assets to "available".

5. **Trade and Process**  
   No turn order. CEOs negotiate deals between two companies. Rules:
   - Each side must offer at least 1 good or $1 million.
   - No gifts; minimum payment required at time of trade.
   - Use only free cash; incoming money goes to new income.
   - Goods may be traded multiple times.
   - Future promises allowed but not binding.
   - Secondary producers may process goods once per turn (e.g., coal + steel → railroads), then shift to "used".

6. **Sales**  
   Companies sell goods to bank at current market price (income to new income slot).  
   Optional storage:
   - Pay storage cost: 1st free, 2nd = $5M, 3rd = +$10M, 4th = +$15M.
   - Max 4 goods stored.
   - Cannot store if cannot pay cost.

7. **Close the Books**  
   For each company:
   - Compare new income vs. last year’s income.
   - If new ≤ last year: place red boot marker (decline).
   - **Exception**: No company gets a boot marker in its first full turn of operations.
   - Then: Add last year’s income to free cash. Move new income to last year’s income. Place dollar sign on it.

8. **Blame Game** (only for companies with boot marker)  
   Order: Company with highest-numbered asset acts first.  
   In each company:
   - CEO, CFO, COO each nominate one board member (self or other) as scapegoat.
   - Anyone nominated at least once is fired.
   - Fired executives receive:
     - CEO: 40% of current free cash (rounded down) to private cash.
     - CFO/COO: 20% each.
   - Return markers; promote remaining executives upward (CEO → CFO → COO → middle managers), filling gaps left to right.
   - If no executives remain → liquidate company:
     - Remove placard and card from game.
     - Return cash and goods to bank.
     - Assets go to discard pile.
   - **CEO Restructuring**: Regardless of whether CEO changed, the current CEO must discard one asset of their choice to the discard pile.

9. **Work Hard, Play Hard**  
   Players bid for status symbols using private cash.
   - Gold symbol auction first:
     - Starting player opens bid (min = current price on gold track).
     - Bidding proceeds clockwise; min raise = $10M.
     - Highest bidder pays, gains symbol, and triggers:
       - Adjust relevant price trend by card’s effect.
       - Starting player passes to player on left.
       - Update gold price track to reflect sale price.
   - Silver symbol auction:
     - Same rules, but:
       - Player who bought gold cannot bid.
       - Starting player does not change.
   - If gold unsold, auction silver anyway.

10. **Entrepreneurs**  
   Players bid to start a new company (if phase not skipped).
   - Skipped when number of started companies = number of players.
   - Only players with <2 companies may bid.
   - Starting player opens bid (min = $50M).
   - Bidding proceeds clockwise; min raise = $1M.
   - Winner:
     - Pays to bank.
     - Chooses any available company card (5–9).
     - Adjusts price trend per card.
     - Gets placard and $100M in free cash.
     - Places own marker as CEO.
     - May take 0–4 assets from discard pile (no new executives added).

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Price Trends**: Never reset. Hard limits: +2 and -3. Adjusted in Phase 1 (asset cards), Phase 9 (status symbols).
- **Executive Control**: Player may control multiple companies. Max 2 via bidding; can “inherit” third via blame game.
- **Money Flow**:
  - Company slots: Free Cash, New Income, Last Year’s Income.
  - All company money public; private cash public.
  - Only way to gain private cash: severance from being fired.
- **Asset Management**:
  - Max 4 assets per company.
  - Only way to remove assets: CEO discards one after Blame Game.
  - Unclaimed assets stay on table; discard pile only accessible to new companies.
- **Turn Order**:
  - Player actions: Clockwise from starting player.
  - Company actions: By highest asset number (tie: highest number wins).
- **Blame Mechanics**:
  - All board members (CEO, CFO, COO) can be blamed by any other.
  - Self-blame allowed.
  - Promotion fills all gaps; no skipping ranks.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End**: Ends at the conclusion of Phase 10 in the year when all asset cards have been drawn and played (i.e., draw stack exhausted and final cards used).
- **Scoring**:
  - Total status points from owned status symbols.
  - Status points are public.
- **Victory**:
  - Highest status points wins.
  - Tie: Most private cash wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **CEO Restructuring**: Always occurs after Blame Game if company had a boot marker, even if CEO was not fired.
- **Asset Discard Order**: When multiple companies restructure, order is by highest asset number; CEO chooses which asset to discard.
- **First Turn Protection**: No company (including newly formed ones) can receive a boot marker in their first full turn.
- **Double Payment Rule**: Only applies when acquiring an asset with same faction as current CEO. Does not apply to inherited or passed assets.
- **Private Cash Transfers**: Cannot directly transfer between companies. Must use trade (e.g., sell good for $1M).
- **Future Deals**: Binding only at moment of execution. Reciprocal future actions not enforceable.
- **Cash-Only Trades**: Allowed (e.g., $30M for $2M).
- **Production Overflow**: If insufficient goods cards, use tokens as substitutes. Mandatory production regardless.
- **Status Symbol Limits**: 9 of each type provided; only 8 rounds in 4/5-player games, but 12 in 3-player games.
- **Liquidated Companies**: Permanently removed. Cannot be revived.
- **Price Track Resolution**: Sum all Phase 1 cards played that round; apply net change. No carryover.
