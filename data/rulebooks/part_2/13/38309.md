### 1. Lore & Objective
God's Playground covers the history of Poland from the 1400s to the 1790s, simulating threats from the Teutonic Knights, Swedes, Prussians, Russians, Tatars, Ottomans, and the politically dominant Habsburgs. Players represent one of three noble families (Radziwiłłs, Potockis, Sapiehas), balancing personal gain against national defense.

**Objective:** Earn the most victory points through military campaigns, estate control, political influence, religious investment, and wealth. The game ends after four turns, and the player with the highest score wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the 4 turns consists of 16 phases:

1. **Income** – Collect money from estates and land managers (minimum 10).
2. **Nobles** – Place one noble block face-down in each region and Polish Army box. Reveal and place cubes equal to block values.
3. **Elect the King** – Player with highest block in Polish Army box becomes first player. Tie: blind bid (all bids paid).
4. **Polish Army** – Add base units (per turn) + bonus units from Polish Army Size table (based on total noble blocks in Polish Army box).
5. **Events** – Roll 4 dice. Add one strength cube to enemy box per matching die (1–5). 6 = no effect. In Turn 4, if Ottomans control Habsburgs, 5 = Ottoman cube in Habsburg box.
6. **Elections** – In each region, player with most cubes wins: remove 1 cube, place 1 disc in Sejm. Tie = no disc.
7. **Build Estates** – Players take turns placing estate discs (cost: 1 cube for first, 2 cubes for each additional).
8. **Special Actions (2 rounds)** – Each player performs two actions (any order, some restricted per turn).
9. **Buy Armies** – Remove 1 cube from region to buy and place units there. Repeat until all pass.
10. **Campaigns** – Players take turns launching attacks. Remove 1 cube to campaign. Roll dice for hits. May use Polish Army (cost: 1 Sejm disc).
11. **Enemies Attack** – Roll 4 dice. Add cubes. Resolve attacks in enemy number order. Treaty broken if enemy number rolled twice+.
12. **Poland Fights Back** – Players may use Polish Army to attack enemy strength in regions (cost: 1 Sejm disc; first player gets one free use).
13. **Enemies Expand** – If enemy strength > player cubes in a region, expand to adjacent regions (per colored arrows).
14. **Estates** – Remove estates if enemy present. Adjust estate values.
15. **Victory Points** – Score VPs for enemy dominance, Sejm discs, and money.
16. **End of Turn** – Reset game state: return cubes, discs, armies, treaty; reduce enemy strength in regions.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Special Actions
- **Place Land Manager:** Remove 1 cube → place manager under estate (adds +2 income).
- **Danzig:** Remove 1 cube from Prussia → gain 2 × Prussia’s estate value.
- **Diplomacy:** Remove 1 cube from enemy-connected region + 1 Sejm disc + pay (die roll + 2) → place treaty marker. Prevents enemy attack unless treaty broken (enemy number rolled ≥2 times in Enemies Attack).
  - Cannot treaty with Ottomans.
  - Cannot treaty with Habsburgs in Turns 1–3.
- **Move Cubes:** Move 1–2 cubes between regions (no cost).
- **Liberum Veto:** Remove 1 cube → remove all discs from Sejm.
- **Confederation:** Remove 2 cubes → replace another player’s estate disc with yours. Conditions:
  - Only Turns 3–4.
  - You have fewest VPs (no tie).
  - You have more cubes in region than target.
  - Target estate must be lowest value available; cannot have city.
- **Jesuit Schools:** Per region: remove 1 cube + pay $2 → gain 1 VP. Bonus: +2 VP if done in all 5 regions. Only Turns 2–4.
- **New City:** Remove 2 cubes → place city marker under estate. Triples VP at end. Only Turns 3–4. Max 1 per turn (2 per game).

#### Army Purchase
- **Infantry:** $2 (4 available)
- **Cavalry:** $4 (3 available)
- **Artillery:** $6 (1 available; only Turns 2–4)
- **Cossacks:** $2 each (2 available); placed in Ukraine. If not bought, join Tatars.
- **Cost halved** if placing in region with enemy strength.

#### Combat
- **Campaigns / Poland Fights Back:**
  - Roll 1 die per infantry (hit on 5–6) and cavalry (hit on 4–6).
  - Artillery adds +1 to all rolls.
  - Each hit places 1 cube in enemy box (player’s cube in Campaigns, King’s cube if Polish Army).
  - Roll of 1 = unit eliminated.
- **Cossacks:** Can be used in attack if in Ukraine and player has own unit there. Only attack Tatars. Roll as cavalry.
- **Polish Army:** Can join player attack (cost: 1 Sejm disc). Hits use King’s cubes. Cannot be used against Habsburg influence pieces.

#### Enemy Behavior
- **Attack:** Enemy strength = base (per turn) + cubes in box. Attacks if strength > player cubes in enemy box. Difference = cubes placed in connected region.
- **Habsburgs (Turns 1–3):** Use influence pieces (not cubes). Each piece cancels 1 noble cube in Great Poland (removed in turn order). Remaining pieces move to Great Poland.
- **Ottomans (Turn 3):** Attack Habsburg box instead of Little Poland.
- **Ottomans (Turn 4):** If they occupied Habsburg box in Turn 3, they have 12 strength in Ottoman box and 10 (+2) in Habsburg box. Habsburg box is treated as Polish region with 2 pre-printed noble cubes.
- **Expansion:** If enemy strength > player cubes in region, place new cubes (equal to difference) in adjacent regions (per arrows). Habsburg influence pieces expand but are removed if entering region with enemy cubes.

#### Estate Rules
- **Loss:** If enemy strength > player cubes in region, remove (enemy strength – player cubes) estates (minimum 1). Remove from highest value down.
- **Value Change:**
  - +1: Region never invaded this turn.
  - 0: Invaded but enemy removed.
  - –1: Enemy still present.
  - Max 5, min 1.
- **Great Poland (Turns 1–3, unless Ottomans in Habsburg box):**
  - Value +1 only if ≥2 player cubes present.
  - Value –1 if Habsburg influence pieces present.
  - Otherwise, value unchanged.

#### Cossack Rules
- Available for purchase in Buy Armies phase (must be placed in Ukraine).
- Can be used by any player with own unit in Ukraine.
- If not purchased, placed in Tatar box (fight against Poland).
- In Turn 2, each die roll of 6 in Enemies Attack → 1 Cossack switches to Tatar side (max 2).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
At end of Turn 4:

1. **End-Turn Victory Points (Phase 15):**
   - Most cubes in enemy box: score VPs as labeled (tie: split, fractions lost).
   - 2 VP per Sejm disc.
   - 1 VP per $5 in hand (must discard full $5 lots).

2. **Final Scoring:**
   - Each estate: worth value in circle.
   - Estates with city: value ×3.
   - Land managers do not affect VP.

**Winning:** Highest total VP wins. Tiebreakers:
1. Most noble cubes on board.
2. Most money.
3. Closest to first player in turn order.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Treaty but can’t pay?** You cannot complete the action. Pay all money you have. Another player may then attempt the treaty.
- **Land managers limited?** Yes (8 total).
- **Polish Army size limit?** Yes: max 4 infantry, 4 cavalry, 1 artillery.
- **King’s cubes limited?** Yes (12).
- **Player cubes limited?** Yes (20 per player).
- **Money limited?** Yes (44 total: 22×5 + 22×1).
- **Cossacks alone in Ukraine?** They do not fight during Enemies Attack.
- **Artillery + Cossacks?** Artillery does not support Cossacks if no player units present.
- **Habsburg influence in region?** Removed immediately if enemy strength cubes are placed there.
- **Habsburg influence at end of turn?** Not removed. They remain in region and affect next turn’s Estates phase.
- **Ottoman cubes in Habsburg box at end of Turn 3?** Reduce to 2 cubes (or 1 if only 1 present). In Turn 4, Ottoman strength = 12 (Ottoman box) and 10 (Habsburg box, +2 already present).
