3. Setup

2. **Courier**: Place 2 spaces away from any city without a wagon.

   - Gray cylinder at bottom of Wagon Arrival/Wagon track.  
   - Second gray cylinder at Aktionphase 1 (if using Die Händler version).  
4. **Goods**: One of each good on lowest space of Price Track.

   - Place 1 coat of arms/small tile on lowest level (“Kramer”) of Status track.  
7. **Start Player**: Designated; receives Turn Sequence Board or places marker at Action 1.

4. Gameplay Flow (Turn Phases)  
Each turn has 6–7 phases. Turn order is clockwise, starting with current Start Player (rotates left after each turn).

1. **Purchasing Goods**  
   - Each player buys 0–3 goods from supply at current buying price (left side of Price Track).  
   - Goods must be placed in player’s warehouse in a city where the good is produced.  
   - **First turn only**: repeat this phase once (total 0–6 goods purchasable).  
   - **Favorable Purchasing / Reduced Cost**: If player owns card, pay 100 (Guilder/Florin) total for all goods bought this phase, regardless of normal price.

2. **Loading Wagons**  
   - Only if wagons are present in a city.  
   - For each wagon (in ascending city order):  
     a. **Auction for Loading Master (LM)**: Closed-fist auction. Highest bidder wins. Tie: Start Player or closest clockwise. Winner pays bid to bank, becomes LM. Others keep bids.  
     b. **LM Loads**: Places 0–3 goods of one type (from own warehouse in that city) into wagon slot.  
     c. **Other Players**: May negotiate to load up to 2 goods (any type), but neither can match the LM’s good type. LM sets price; payment goes directly to LM.  
     d. **Limits**: LM: max 3 of one type. Others: max 2 total, no shared type with LM.  
     e. **Retention**: LM keeps title as long as wagon remains in city and can still be loaded. No auction next turn if wagon stays. Load limits still apply.

3. **Movement**  
   - Players take turns:  
     a. Select one movement tile, place face-down.  
     b. Move any wagon the number of spaces shown.  
     c. Full movement must be used unless:  
        - Wagon reaches a city.  
        - Would end on same space as another wagon (cannot occupy same space).  
     d. Wagons may pass each other; movement cost unchanged.  
     e. Cannot move backward, even at junctions.  
   - **Driver / Great Driver / Coach Driver**: Extra movement points (1 or 2) can extend one wagon’s movement or be split to move additional wagons.  
   - **Courier / Express Courier / Great Courier**:  
     - Owner may move Courier during their turn (before or after wagon).  
     - Cannot enter cities.  
     - If Courier ends on same space as a wagon: owner draws 1 green card of choice.  
     - If a wagon moves to Courier or Courier moves to a wagon: card earned.  
     - Multiple cards possible per turn.  
   - After all players reveal movement tiles, tiles are returned face-up for reuse.

4. **Market Prices**  
   - Players simultaneously use price wheels to select:  
     - One or both dials on a good → price increases by 1 per dial (max +2).  
     - Or set one/both dials to coat of arms → no effect.  
   - Prices move up one level per selection.  
   - **Overflow**: If a good is at top and would rise further, it wraps to bottom (only if Large Office rule applies; otherwise not specified).  
   - **Office / Large Office**: After price adjustments:  
     - Player may move one good up or down one level.  
     - **Large Office**: Can wrap (top to bottom or vice versa).  
     - **Office**: Cannot wrap.  
     - Multiple players: resolved in clockwise order from Start Player.  
   - **Warehouse Selling**: After Offices act:  
     - Player may sell up to 3 goods (Die Händler) or 5 goods (Merchants) from warehouses at current buying price.  
     - Goods return to supply.

5. **Selling Delivered Goods**  
   - Only if wagons arrived in cities this turn.  
   - For each arriving wagon:  
     a. Move gray cylinder up one space on Wagon Arrival/Wagon track.  
     b. Sell all goods on wagon at current selling price (right side of Price Track).  
     c. Bonus: If good is not produced in destination city, receive bonus from city’s Bonus track.  
     d. After sale: Wagon is turned outward (indicating empty); goods returned to supply.  
   - **Update Bonus Track**: For each city:  
     - If a wagon is present: Bonus marker resets to 0.  
     - If no wagon: move marker up 1, or stay at 500 if already max.

6. **Auctioning Investment Cards** (Merchants version only)  
   - Start Player begins auction with minimum bid (100 Florins or multiple).  
   - Players clockwise: raise or pass.  
   - Last remaining player wins, pays bank, picks one red card from face-up display.  
   - Next auction: started by next eligible player (not yet bought a card).  
   - Repeat until all but one player have bought or all pass.  
   - Replenish face-up red cards to 4 (if possible).  
   - Each player may buy only 1 card per turn.

7. **Upkeep (Social Status)**  
   - Each player pays upkeep cost based on current Status level.  
   - If unable to pay:  
     - Pay maximum possible.  
     - Reduce status to affordable level.  
     - May take 1 Credit card and 2000 currency (Guilder/Florin).  
     - Max one Credit per turn, no lifetime limit.  
   - Repayment: Any time, pay 2500 per Credit card to clear debt.  
   - If able to pay and has no Credit: may increase status by 0–2 levels at cost shown on Wagon Arrival track (per level).  
   - Players without Credit may buy higher levels (up to 2) at price on Wagon track.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Market Manipulation**: Players influence prices via dials; Offices allow post-market adjustments.  
- **Negotiation**: Loading phase involves player-to-player deals for wagon space.  
- **Movement Strategy**: Tile selection, Courier interaction, and movement bonuses (Driver, Courier cards).  
- **Investment & Upgrades**: Red cards grant persistent abilities; status affects prestige and cost.  
- **Risk Management**: Debt via Credit cards offers short-term funds but disqualifies from winning unless repaid.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Condition**: Game ends after Phase 6 (Die Händler) or Phase 7 (Merchants) when Wagon Arrival track reaches:  
  - 2 players: 6  
  - 3 players: 7  
  - 4 players: 8  
- **Winning**:  
  - Must have **no outstanding Credit cards**.  
  - Highest Status level wins.  
  - Tiebreaker: most money.  
- **Scoring**: No explicit point system; victory determined by Status and financial solvency.
