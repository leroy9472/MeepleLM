## Byzantium — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Byzantium is a two-player strategic conflict game representing the struggle between the Byzantine and Arab empires. Players vie for dominance through military conquest, economic control, and special actions. The game ends either after three full turns or immediately upon the fall of Constantinople. Victory is determined by Victory Points (VP), with different scoring outcomes depending on the end condition.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

**Turn Sequence:**  
1. **Player Actions Phase**  
   - Players alternate taking actions in clockwise order (starting player first).  
   - On your turn, choose one action or pass.  
   - Once a player passes, they place a cube from the casualty pool (or elsewhere) into the pass box and are inactive until the phase ends.  
   - The last active player gets one extra action before the phase ends.

2. **Income Phase**  
   - Receive 2 Bezants for each city you control.

3. **Maintenance Phase**  
   - Return the Emperor/Caliph cube to the special action box (if used).  
   - Pay maintenance costs: Each cube in your army display costs Bezants equal to the number in the gold circle on its box.  
   - If you cannot pay, remove the unpaid cube(s) from the game and lose 1 VP per removed cube.

4. **New Turn Phase**  
   - The first player to have passed becomes the new first player.  
   - Return cubes from:
     - Special action box
     - Tax box
     - Pass box  
     → to the cube pool.
   - Return half the cubes from the casualty pool to the cube pool (round up).
   - Advance the turn marker.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Player Actions (Choose One Per Turn)  

**A. Take Control of a City**  
- Place a cube from cube pool (free) or elsewhere (costs 3 Bezants) on an uncontrolled city.  
- Gain VP equal to the number of city tokens on that city.

**B. Increase Army**  
- Add up to 3 cubes to your army display.  
- Only one cube may go into the elite box.  
- Cubes can come from:
  - Cube pool → free
  - Anywhere else → 3 Bezants each

**C. Special Action**  
Only one player may use each special action per turn. Place a cube to activate:

- **Civil War**: Use during Move/Attack. Attack a city of your own side.
- **Improve City**: Add 1 city token to any city. Max 3 tokens per city.
- **Emperor/Caliph**: Place Emperor/Caliph cube in elite box and gain 2 VP. May be used to satisfy a casualty requirement.
- **Bulgars**:  
  - Option 1: Add 2 Bulgar cubes and attack (up to 3 dice).  
  - Option 2: Add 4 Bulgar cubes (only if possible).  
  - Max 11 cubes in Bulgar box.  
  - Can attack via orange arrows or cities connected to Bulgar cities (not through sea lanes).  
  - On successful attack: gain VP only (no Bezants), for the *opposite* side from the one that lost the city.  
  - This is the only way to attack your own cities.
- **Fortify**: Replace your control cube in a city with one of your city tokens. The control cube goes to the casualty pool. The city token counts during sieges but not for VP or income.
- **Byzantine Fleet**:  
  - Double the cost for Arab armies using sea lanes.  
  - Roll dice (equal to number of Arab cubes used for sea movement) to destroy Arab cubes (roll ≥4 to hit).  
  - May deny retreat of Arab armies through sea lanes.
- **Arab Fleet**: Halve the sea movement cost for your own Arab army.

**D. Tax**  
- Once per turn.  
- Move any number of cubes from the **cube pool only** to the tax box.  
- Gain 2 Bezants per cube moved.  
- Bezants can be freely distributed between Byzantine and Arab sides.

**E. Build Church/Mosque**  
- Place a cube (from anywhere) on a city you control. Pay 6 Bezants.  
- Gain 2 VP.  
- Cube remains until end of game (not returned).

**F. Move and/or Attack**  
- Move one of your armies.  
- Army consists of elite and main army boxes (move box cubes are spent during movement).  
- Remove any casualties before moving.

**Movement Rules:**  
- An army may move up to 2 times per turn.  
- First movement must be through a friendly city (same side).  
- Each movement costs 1 cube from the move box → casualty pool.  
  - Second movement requires an additional cube.  
- Byzantine army in Constantinople: can move in one action to any city bordering Mediterranean or Black Sea.  
- Arabs can move over desert lanes.  
- Sea movement costs:  
  - Normal: 2 cubes  
  - Double sea move: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 cubes total  
- Movement from Nicaea to Constantinople costs double.

**Attack Rules:**  
- Triggered when entering an opponent-controlled city.  
- Cannot attack yourself.  
- Invading army fights either:
  - Defending army (if present), OR  
  - Levies (if defender chooses)  
- Not both.  
- If defending army is present, defender chooses whether to fight or retreat.

**Retreat Rules (Defending Army):**  
- Free movement to closest friendly city.  
- Lose 1 cube for each unfriendly city passed through.  
- Arab army with no retreat path is eliminated.

**Battle Resolution:**  
- Attacking army rolls: 1 die per main army cube (max 3) + 1 die per elite cube.  
- Defending army (or levies) rolls: 1 die per cube in relevant box (max 3).  
- Roll of 4 or higher = hit.  
- Remove casualties.  
- Compare total strength:
  - Army strength = elite + main army cubes  
  - Levy strength = levy box cubes  
- Higher strength wins. Defender wins ties.  
- Losing army must retreat to starting city.

**Siege Phase (After Winning Battle):**  
- Defender rolls dice equal to number of city tokens.  
- Each hit inflicts 1 casualty on attacker’s army.  
- If attacker’s strength > number of city tokens → attacker wins siege.  
- Else → attacker retreats to starting city.

**Successful Attack (After Siege Win):**  
- Remove fortification token (if any) and defending control cube → casualty pool.  
- Replace city tokens with opponent-colored tokens, minus 1 (minimum 1 token).  
- Attacker gains:
  - VP = number of new city tokens  
  - Bezants = number of new city tokens  
  - (If no tokens remain after reduction, place 1 new token; gain 0 VP/Bezants)  
- Place a control cube on the city:
  - From cube pool → free  
  - From elsewhere → 3 Bezants  
- If unable to place a control cube, remove 2 cubes from your army:  
  - 1 becomes control cube  
  - 1 goes to casualty pool

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

**Game Ends When:**  
- End of Turn 3, OR  
- Constantinople falls to Arab forces (immediate end)

**Scoring:**  

**Case 1: Game ends after 3 Turns**  
- Gain 1 VP for each of your city tokens.  
- Total score = sum of VP from both sides **only if** the smaller side’s VP ≥ half of the larger side’s VP.  
- Otherwise, total score = VP of the larger side only.

**Case 2: Fall of Constantinople**  
- Game ends immediately.  
- Total score = Arab VP only (including 5 VP for taking Constantinople).  
- Byzantine city tokens do not score.

**Tiebreakers (in order):**  
1. Highest combined VP from both sides  
2. Most cities controlled  
3. Most Bezants
