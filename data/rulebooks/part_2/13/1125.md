## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Speculators flood a booming city, competing to acquire valuable real estate lots. Players strategically bid on ownership cubes and deploy them across the city to gain control of high-value lots. The goal is to maximize financial status by acquiring profitable properties, leveraging bonuses from x2 lots, and managing debt wisely. The player with the best financial standing who meets ownership requirements wins.

### 2. Components  
- **Game Board**: Features 13 building lots, divided into 4 districts by dashed lines. Includes 18 auction spaces around the perimeter.  
- **72 Ownership Cubes**: 18 cubes each in 4 colors (one per player).  
- **1 Real Estate Broker Piece**: Moved each round to determine which auction occurs.  
- **Coins**: 45 total — 1M (x20), 5M (x15), 10M (x10).  
- **Player Tokens**: 4 colored tokens (one per player).  
- **30 IOU Tokens (-10)**: Represent loans of 10M each; interest reduces disbursement.  
- **13 SOLD Tokens**: Placed on lots to indicate ownership.  
- **1 Die**: Used to move the broker.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Randomly place 4 cubes (from any colors) on each of the 18 auction spaces. Ensure at least 2 different colors per space.  
3. Randomly place the broker piece on one auction space.  
4. Create a bank area: place all coins, IOU tokens, and SOLD tokens here.  
5. Give each player:  
   - One player token (matching their cube color).  
   - One 10M coin from the bank.  
6. Determine starting player; play proceeds clockwise.  
7. Keep player tokens, coins, and IOUs visible at all times.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts exactly **18 rounds**, one for each auction space. Each round has three phases:

#### (1) Move the Broker  
- The starting player rolls the die and moves the broker clockwise that many spaces.  
- **Skip auction spaces with no cubes**.  
- After movement, pass the die to the next player clockwise (they will start next round).

#### (2) Auction the Cubes  
- An auction is held for the 4 cubes on the current broker space.  
- Bidding order: begins with the player to the left of the die roller, proceeds clockwise.  
- Players may:  
  - **Bid** at least 1M more than the previous bid.  
  - **Pass** — once passed, cannot re-enter bidding.  
- A player without sufficient funds may:  
  - **Take a loan** from the bank (see Loans section), or  
  - **Pass** instead of bidding.  
- Bidding ends when only one player remains.  
- **Winner pays their bid to the bank** and takes all 4 cubes.  
- **If all players pass**, the player who rolled the die takes the 4 cubes for free.

#### (3) Deploy the Cubes  
- The winning bidder places their 4 cubes on the 13 lots.  
- Cubes can be distributed across multiple lots or stacked on one.  
- Placement must follow ownership rules (see Acquire Lots).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Acquire Lots  
- A lot can hold **up to 7 cubes**.  
- When the **7th cube is placed**, determine ownership immediately:  
  - The player with the **most cubes** on the lot wins ownership.  
  - **Tie rules**:  
    - If two or more players tie for the most cubes (e.g., 3/3/1, 2/2/2/1), **those tied cubes are ignored**.  
    - Ownership goes to the player with the **next highest number of cubes** (e.g., the player with 1 cube wins if others are tied at 3).  
    - If after ignoring tied cubes there's still a tie (e.g., 2/2 or 1/1/1), **no one owns the lot**.  
  - Once decided:  
    - Place a **SOLD token** and **one winning cube** on the lot.  
    - **Remove the other 6 cubes** from the game.  

- **Endgame ownership**:  
  - After round 18, resolve all lots with fewer than 7 cubes using the same rules.  
  - Most cubes wins. Ties ignored; if still tied, no owner.

#### Loans  
- Each player may take **one loan per round**, but only **once per round**.  
- Loan value: **10M**, but net receipt decreases with each loan:  
  - 1st loan: receive **9M** (1M interest withheld).  
  - 2nd: **8M**, 3rd: **7M**, ..., 10th: **0M** (still owe 10M).  
- Receive one **IOU token** per loan (face value always 10M).  
- IOUs must be **kept visible**.  
- At game end, players **repay full face value** (number of IOUs × 10M) from their funds.

#### Valuation of Lots  
- The number on a lot is its base value in **M** (millions).  
- Two **x2 lots** have no value on their own.  
- If a player owns an **x2 lot and any adjacent lot(s)** (e.g., 9, 10, 11) **in the same district**, the value of **those adjacent lots is doubled**.  
- Example: Red owns x2 lot, lot 9 (value 9), and lot 10 (value 10) → earns (9+10)×2 = **38M**.  
- Adjacent lots must be in the same district and owned by the same player.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after **18 rounds** (all auction cubes placed).  
- Resolve ownership of all lots (including those with <7 cubes) using tie rules.  
- **Scoring per player**:  
  - Sum:  
    - Value of all owned lots.  
    - All coins in possession.  
  - Subtract:  
    - Total loan debt = number of IOU tokens × 10M.  
- **Winning Conditions**:  
  - Only players who **own at least two lots** are eligible to win.  
  - Among eligible players, highest financial status wins.  
  - **Tiebreakers**:  
    1. Most owned lots.  
    2. Highest value single lot owned.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place cubes on a full lot?**  
  No. Once 7 cubes are on a lot, no more can be added. Cubes must be placed elsewhere.

- **What if I can’t pay my loans at the end?**  
  You still subtract the full amount. Negative financial status is allowed.

- **Can I use cubes from both colors in a 2-player game interchangeably?**  
  No. After winning an auction, you must pay the bid using coins from **only one color**, and cubes deployed count toward that color’s ownership.

- **Do x2 lots double all my adjacent lots in the district?**  
  Only the adjacent lots **you own**. The x2 lot must also be **in the same district**.

- **In 3-player game, can the neutral player win?**  
  No. The neutral player can own lots, but is ignored in final scoring.

- **What happens if all lots are full before round 18?**  
  Continue playing all 18 rounds. Cubes from later auctions must be placed on lots with fewer than 7 cubes. If no legal placement exists, cubes cannot be placed — but this is extremely unlikely.

- **Can I take a loan after bidding has started?**  
  - **Standard game**: Yes, at any time during your turn, even during bidding.  
  - **Challenging variation**: Only **before bidding begins**.
