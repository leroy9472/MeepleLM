## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Phoenicia is a strategy game set in the ancient Fertile Crescent, where players compete to build prosperous city-states through economic development and auctions. The goal is to be the first to reach **32 Victory Points (VP)**. The game ends immediately when any player reaches or exceeds this threshold. The player with the most VP wins, using tiebreakers if necessary.

- Adjust number of Development Cards by player count:
  - 2 players: 1 of each card (19 total)

  - 4 players: 2 of each card (38 total)
  - 5 players: all cards (48 total)
- Shuffle each numbered set (1, 2, 3, 4) separately.
- Stack deck: Set 4 (bottom), then 3, then 2, then Set 1 (top).
- Flip **1 card per player** from Set 1 to form initial auction pool.
  - If **Granary** or **Fort** is revealed, reshuffle it back and draw again.
- Shuffle remaining Set 1 cards and place on top of deck.

**Player Setup**:

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in two phases:

#### Phase 1: Player Turns (clockwise from Overlord)  
Each player completes all three steps before next player begins:
1. **Initiate Auctions (optional)**  
   - Choose any card in auction pool to auction.
   - Bid starts at minimum bid on card.
   - Bidding proceeds clockwise; players may raise or pass.
   - Auction ends when all but one pass.
   - Winner pays bid (in Production Cards and/or Discs), receives change in Discs.
   - Apply discounts from previously purchased cards.
   - Place card in play area; apply immediate effects (VP, Production, Workers, Tiles, etc.).
   - May initiate additional auctions (if able).
   - **Once done, cannot bid in other auctions this round.**

2. **Train, Employ, or Shift Workers (optional)**  
   Unlimited actions in any order:
   - **Train a Worker**: Pay 2 Discs (or 1 if Training Ground is Improved) to move a pawn from upper (untrained) to lower (trained) section of Training Ground.
   - **Employ a Trained Worker**:
     - Pay tool cost (2, 5, 8, or 11) OR use existing tool disc.
     - Move worker to next available space on activity tile.
     - Adjust VP and Production based on **difference** between current and previous space.
     - If employed in **Clothmaking**, add 1 Storehouse to Storage tile.
   - **Shift a Worker** (to higher-cost activity):
     - Pay full tool cost of new activity (or use tool disc).
     - Move worker to next space on new tile.
     - Leave a tool disc on old tile.
     - Adjust VP/Production based on **net gain**.
     - Cannot shift to lower-cost activities.

3. **Buy Tools & Adjust Treasury (mandatory)**  
   - May buy tool discs by paying tool cost; place disc on tile.
   - With **City Center**, may pay 3 Discs to gain 1 VP (max 3; 6 if Improved).
   - May convert **one** Production Card into Discs (value in Discs).
   - Apply **treasury limit**: Discard excess Discs beyond Storage capacity (3 or 6).
   - Turn ends; no further auctions allowed this round.

#### Phase 2: Administration (done collectively, often by one player)  
After all players finish their turns:
1. **Check for Victory / Designate Overlord**  
   - If any player has **≥32 VP**, game ends.
     - Most VP wins.
     - Tiebreakers:
       1. Current Overlord wins (if tied)
       2. Highest total unspent cards + Discs
       3. All tied players win
   - Else, new Overlord = player with most VP.
     - Tie: closest to left of current Overlord.

2. **Refill Auction Pool**  
   - Draw cards from top of deck until pool has **1 card per player**.

3. **Distribute Income**  
   - Each player gains cards/discs based on **Production** (disc position):
     - E.g., Production 6 = 1 card + 2 discs
   - Immediately convert **every 4 Discs** into 1 Production Card.
     - If deck runs out, reshuffle discard pile.

4. **Apply Storage and Treasury Limits**  
   - **Storage Limit**: 1 Production Card per Storehouse.
     - Discard excess cards; may convert discarded card into Discs (up to available Treasury space).
   - **Treasury Limit**: 3 (basic Storage) or 6 (Improved Storage via Granary).
     - Discard excess Discs beyond limit.
   - Cannot convert Discs back into cards this turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Victory Points (VP)**: Tracked by cylinder. Goal: reach 32.
- **Production**: Tracked by disc. Determines income each round.
- **Workers**:
  - White pawns = workers.
  - White icon = untrained; black icon = trained (no black pawns used).
  - Training required before employment.
- **Money**:
  - Two types: **Production Cards** (4/5/6 value) and **Discs** (value 1).
  - Discs on Storage = Coins; elsewhere = Tools.
  - Change given only in Discs.
- **Discounts**:
  - Some Development Cards grant discounts on future cards.
  - Multiple copies increase discount (e.g., 2x Tracker = -5, 3x = -7).
  - Track with discount cubes.
- **Tile Upgrades**:
  - Some cards flip or replace tiles (e.g., Granary → Improved Storage; Tracker → Improved/Advanced Hunting).
  - Move existing workers/tools to new tile.
  - Advance Production if worker productivity increases.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Condition**: Any player reaches **32+ VP** at start of Administration Phase.
- **Winner**: Highest VP.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Current Overlord (if among tied)
  2. Highest total unspent Production Cards + Discs
  3. All tied players win
- **Scoring Accuracy**: At any time, VP can be recalculated by summing:
  - Highest occupied space on each tile
  - VP from Development Cards
  - VP from City Center purchases

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you initiate multiple auctions?**  
  Yes, as long as you can meet minimum bid.

- **Can you buy duplicate Development Cards?**  
  Yes. Required for some tile upgrades (e.g., 2x Tracker for Advanced Hunting).

- **Can you shift workers down?**  
  No. Workers can only shift to higher-cost activities.

- **Can you untrain workers?**  
  No. Once trained, always trained.

- **Do you get change in cards?**  
  No. Change is always in Discs.

- **Can you exceed storage limits during your turn?**  
  Yes, temporarily. Must correct during Step 3 (Adjust Treasury) and again in Administration.

- **What happens to un-auctioned cards?**  
  They remain in pool until someone auctions them.

- **Are there prerequisites for Development Cards?**  
  No. Cards like Dye House can be bought without Dyer (though Dyer gives discount).

- **Can you use a newly bought discount in the same turn?**  
  Yes. E.g., buy Shipyard, then use discount on Ship auction later that turn.

- **What happens when Production deck runs out?**  
  Reshuffle discard pile to form new deck.

- **Can you transfer cards or pieces between players?**  
  No. All transactions are with the bank only.
