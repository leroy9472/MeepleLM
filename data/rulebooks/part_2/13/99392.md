## 4. Gameplay Flow
### Turn Sequence (5 phases):
1. **Endeavour Phase**: 
   - Players simultaneously and secretly select 5 of their 6 Character cards in order
   - Reveal cards one at a time from left to right
   - Starting with first player, each player uses one character from the revealed card or passes
   - Repeat for all 5 cards (5 rounds total)

2. **Merchant Fleets Phase**: 
   - Each player may transfer up to one Treasury counter per Monopoly to their Merchant Fleets box

3. **First Player Phase**: 
   - First Player token goes to player with most Monopolies
   - If tied, token passes to the left of current first player

4. **Naval Forces Phase**: 
   - Each player may transfer up to their Navy track level in Treasury counters to Naval Forces box

5. **Loan Interest Phase**: 
   - Each player adds one counter from their Pool to each of their Loan piles

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Progress Tracks
- **Economy**: Affects selling goods, borrowing money, and Booming City placement
- **Seafaring**: Reduces exploration difficulty
- **Navy**: Limits Naval Forces purchases and enables re-rolls in naval combat
- **Logistics**: Limits Treasury placement via Viceroy action

### Resources & Monopolies
- 10 resource types based on edge color
- A player controls a resource by having the lowest counter in its stack
- A Monopoly exists when a player exclusively controls a resource type
- Each Gold resource is its own monopoly
- Breaking another player's monopoly or taking control of their resource moves the aggressor back one space on Diplomacy track

### Exploration
- Use Explorer character to explore Unexplored Territories
- Roll 10 special dice; need successes ≥ Territory difficulty
- Reduce difficulty by Seafaring level and by 1 if adjacent to player's counter
- Successful exploration: take 1 Prestige and choose to place Merchant Fleet or Treasury + Unrest
- Special rules:
  - India/China: +1 Diplomacy after successful exploration
  - Americas: +2 difficulty until first exploration; first explorer gains +1 Prestige
  - Australia: Two Prestige tokens; second requires successful re-roll
  - Circumnavigation: Available after Americas discovered; difficulty 6 reduced by Seafaring and continents with presence

### Colonies
- Use Conqueror to found in Territory where:
  - Player controls all resources
  - Has counters ≥ Native Power (exceptions for Spain in Americas)
  - Territory has Native Power > 0
- Benefits:
  - Blocks other players from placing counters
  - Adds Native Power to Trader's selling capacity
- Colony founding options (choose any combination):
  1. Company: Move 1 counter to Merchant Fleets
  2. Pillage: Gain Treasury = Native Power (x2 if Gold), place Unrest
  3. Repression: Remove 1-2 Unrest, move back same spaces on Diplomacy
  4. Plantation: In beige-resource territories, steal 1 Merchant Fleet per black resource controlled
- Loss: When owner has no counters, remove Colony, lose 1 Prestige, place Independent State marker (doubles Native Power)

### Booming Cities
- Use Governor to place in explored Territory with player's counter
- Pay Treasury > current Booming City value (minimum 1)
- Cannot exceed Economy level (except for Historical Booming Cities)
- Effects:
  - All resources in Territory produce 2 goods
  - Must ship from Booming City Territory first
  - If unrest present, piracy check: 1+ success = lose 1 Merchant Fleet; 2+ successes = reduce City value by 1
- Historical Booming Cities: Can place value 1 higher than paid (max 10); only these award Prestige

### Trade
- **Merchant**: Ship goods to Market
  - Limit: Number of Merchant Fleets
  - Each controlled resource produces 1 good (2 if in Booming City)
  - Must ship Booming City goods first
  - For other players' goods: they must agree; they gain Treasury
- **Trader**: Sell goods from Market to Treasury
  - Limit: Economy + combined Native Power of all Colonies
  - For other players' goods: they must agree; you gain Treasury

### War
- **Sovereign**: Declare war on player at same or higher Diplomacy level
- Move back 1 space on Diplomacy track
- Resolved in yearly cycles:
  1. **War on Land**: In each shared Territory, simultaneous dice rolls (max 5 each); casualties chosen by attacker
  2. **War at Sea**: Naval Forces battle; casualties first to Naval Forces, then Merchant Fleets
  3. **Surrender**: Defender decides first; loser gives 1 Prestige to winner
- War continues until:
  - Surrender
  - Defeat: One player cannot fight in any theatre
  - Stalemate: Neither player can fight

### Diplomacy Track
- Starting position: 4th space from left
- Can only move right via Ambassador
- Leftmost space restrictions:
  - Cannot declare war, break monopolies, or conduct massacres that would move marker left
  - If war declared on you, attacker must place Unrest in your territory
  - If you break monopoly, victim places Unrest in your territory

### Special Rules by Nation (Nations Variant)
- **Portugal**: Extra Explorer; Logistics max 1; cannot explore Americas outside Brazil until 6 Prestige
- **France**: Extra Sovereign (can advance Diplomacy); Logistics starts at 2; restrictions on early actions
- **Spain**: Extra Missionary; Treaty of Tordesillas restricts expansion until 6 Prestige; Extremadura rule for American colonies; Flamboyance (discard Treasury = Prestige or lose 1 Prestige)
- **Great Britain**: Extra Trader and Financier; Naval re-roll ability; restrictions on early actions
- **Dutch Republic**: +2 Monopolies; Economy starts at 4, Logistics at 2; restrictions on first 3 rounds

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Condition**: First player to reach 10 Prestige with no outstanding loans wins immediately
- **Prestige Sources**:
  - Exploration: 1 per Territory (2 for Australia, +1 for first in Americas)
  - Colonies: 1 for founding on historical goal territory
  - Booming Cities: 1 for establishing historical booming city
  - War: 1 from defeated opponent
  - Circumnavigation: 1 Prestige
  - Exploration board: 1 for leading continent exploration, 1 for most total explorations

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Loans**: Can repay at any time during Endeavour phase; must have zero loans to win
- **Ties**: On First Player, passes left; on exploration leadership, player with most total explorations wins; if still tied, current holder keeps
- **Multiple Actions**: Most characters can be used only once per turn; exceptions noted on Nation cards
- **Independent States**: Cannot ship goods; double Native Power; can be recolonized
- **Booming City in Independent State**: Cannot ship from it; if recolonized, owner gains Prestige
- **Passing**: Players may pass on any character card; order of play still follows sequence
- **Simultaneous Actions**: All players reveal first card simultaneously; then resolve in turn order
