### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of the 8 rounds follows:
1. **Actions Phase** (two turns per player):

2. **Run Trains Phase**:
   - Companies operate in descending share price order.
   - Each train runs one route; revenue is collected.
   - Director decides to pay dividends or retain earnings.
3. **Bureaucracy Phase**:
   - Move next train from deck to Train Pool.
   - Pass starting player card clockwise.
   - Reset action cards.
   - Advance turn counter.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### A. Action Cards
Each card offers two actions. Player chooses one per card.

- **Lay Track Tile**:
  - Must connect to existing network via company station.
  - Cannot violate checkerboard pattern: cities/metropolises alternate with towns/plain tiles.
  - Yellow Y-city costs £50 from company treasury (free for Slamecksan home).
  - Other tiles are free.
  - Orientation may be chosen.

- **Purchase Trains**:
  - Buy from Bank (next available train) or from another company.
  - Price from Bank = printed cost; must be bought in ascending order.
  - Trains from other companies: negotiated price, public, ≥£1.
  - Only new companies or those retaining dividends may buy from Train Pool.
  - A company without a train may use director’s private cash to cover cost; company treasury becomes £0.
  - Obsolete trains (grey side up) may be returned to Train Pool voluntarily.

- **Sell/Buy Shares**:
  - **Sell**: Any number of shares (not director shares). Receive current share price per share. Price marker drops one space per share sold (left/down).
  - **Buy**:
    - 10% share from bank: pay current price.
    - Found new company: take 50% director share, choose starting price, pay 5×price, receive 10×price in treasury. Immediately place home station in empty city/Y and buy any train from Train Pool.
  - Share limit: 5 total shares per player (including director shares).
  - Max 2 director shares per player.

- **Place Station Marker**:
  - First extra station: £40; each additional: £100.
  - Must be in empty city circle.
  - Must connect via legal route from another company station.
  - Only one marker per company per tile.

- **Add £5/10/20 to Private Property**: Add to personal cash.

- **Add £50/70/100 to Company's Treasury**: Split amount between owned companies. Value depends on phase:
  - Phase 1/2: £50
  - Phase 3/4: £70
  - Phase 5+: £100

- **Place Special Character Tile**: Free action, before or after main action. Each Character Card includes unique abilities and track tiles.

#### B. Tile Upgrades
- Green tiles (Phase 3+) replace yellow; brown (Phase 5+) replace green.
- Upgrade must preserve track layout and station positions.
- Cities upgrade to cities, Y to Y, plain to plain.
- Upgrades are free.
- Upgraded tile may provide new station slot.
- Luddnagg (yellow Y) cannot be upgraded; only placeable when brown tiles available.
- Mully Ully Gue's Castle can upgrade cities but not Y-tiles or home cities.

#### C. Running Trains
- Order: descending share price.
- Each train runs once.
- Route must:
  - Include ≥2 revenue locations (cities, towns, harbours, Mildendo, metropolises).
  - Contain a company station.
  - Not reuse track segments.
  - Not reverse at junctions or cross tracks.
  - Enter/exit cities via any track.
- Range = number of cities/metropolises visited (towns/harbours don’t count).
- Mildendo must be start or end if visited.
- Blocked cities (full of enemy stations) cannot be passed through, but may start/end a route.
- D-trains (3D, 4D): double revenue.
- Obsolete trains: revenue halved, rounded down.
- Maximum revenue must be claimed.

#### D. Dividends
- **Pay Dividends**:
  - Revenue distributed to shareholders (including bank, capped at 30%).
  - Share price rises one space right/up.
- **Retain Dividends**:
  - All revenue to company treasury.
  - Share price drops one space left/down.
  - Company may immediately buy any train from Train Pool.
- If company has no train and income = 0, treated as "retaining dividends"; may buy from Train Pool.
- In last round, dividends are doubled and must be paid out.

#### E. Phases
Phases advance when first train of type is bought or moved to Train Pool.

| Phase | Trigger | Track | Train Limit | Effects |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Game start | Yellow only | — | Only £50 option available |
| 2 | First 2-train | Yellow | 4 | — |
| 3 | First 3-train | Green available | 4 | £70 option available |
| 4 | First 4-train | Green | 3 | 2-trains obsolete (revenue ÷2) |
| 5 | First 5-train | Brown available | 2 | 2-trains rust (removed); £100 option |
| 6 | First 3D-train | Brown | 2 | 3-trains obsolete (revenue ÷2) |
| 7 | First 4D-train | Brown | 2 | 4-trains obsolete; 3-trains rust |

- Train limits apply immediately. Cannot exceed even if rusting occurs later.
- When phase causes obsolescence, flip train card (grey side up).
- When phase causes rusting, remove train to "Rusted Trains" area.

#### F. Money

- **Can you run through Mildendo?** No. It must be start or end.
- **Can you use both actions from one card?** No. Only one per card.
- **What if no train can be placed during Bureaucracy?** The train is still moved to Train Pool (or to Gulliver in solo).
- **Can a company run multiple routes?** Yes, one per train, all routes must be separate (no shared track).
- **Can you place a station without building track?** Yes, if a legal route exists.
- **What happens to fractional dividends?** Round down (e.g., 3.5 → 3).
