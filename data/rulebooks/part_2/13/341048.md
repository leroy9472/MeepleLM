## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In the late 19th century, Europe saw the expansion of railway networks that enabled travel to cities showcasing Art Nouveau and Historicism architecture. In *Free Ride*, players act as railway developers and train operators, building rail lines to connect cities and fulfilling passenger travel routes. The goal is to visit as many different European cities as possible by completing travel routes, earning victory points for each unique city and coin collected.

### 2. Components
- 1 game board
- 135 city cards (3 stacks of 45 cards each, labeled "I", "II", "III")
- 140 rail tokens
- 5 train tokens (1 in each player color)
- 16 player mats:
  - 5 train mats (1 per player color, with sides "I" and "II")
  - 10 coach mats (5 marked "I", 5 marked "II")
  - 1 green solo train mat (for solo challenge)
- 125 ownership tokens (25 per player color)
- 5 "rails under construction" tokens (1 per player color)
- 54 coins
- 1 first player signal tile
- 2 rule booklets (English and German)

### 3. Setup
1. Place the game board in the center.
2. Place 2 coins next to each of the 9 cities around the edge of the board (18 coins total).
3. Place all rail tokens and remaining coins in general supply.
4. Each player chooses a color and takes:
   - 1 train token
   - 25 ownership tokens
   - 1 train mat (side "I" up)
   - 1 coach mat "I"
   - 6 coins
   - Rail tokens based on player count:
     - 2 players: 10 rails
     - 3 players: 9 rails
     - 4 players: 8 rails
     - 5 players: 7 rails
5. Place unused components (including coach mats "II" and "rails under construction" tokens) near the supply.
6. Shuffle each of the three city card decks ("I", "II", "III") separately.
7. Draw 3 travel routes (each a column of 3 face-up city cards) from deck "I" to form the initial public display.
8. For 2 players: remove city cards with wheels on both sides (one per city), leaving 30 cards per deck.
9. Choose a first player; they take the first player signal tile.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in three phases: **Prologue**, **Main Game**, and **Finish**.

#### Prologue
- Starting with the first player, each player:
  1. Selects one of the available travel routes (columns of 3 city cards).
  2. Chooses one of two options:
     - Top card (start) and center card (destination), return bottom card.
     - Center card (start) and bottom card (destination), return top card.
  3. Places their train on the starting city.
  4. Takes both city cards of the route and places them on their coach, destination on top.
  5. Collects 2 coins if present at the starting city.
- After each player selects:
  - Non-last players: add 2 new travel routes (3 for 2 players).
  - Last player: refill display to 6 total travel routes.

#### Main Game
On your turn, choose one of three actions:

**a) Build Rails**
- Spend up to 2 construction points to place rail tokens.
- You may start or continue building a railway line if your train can reach it via existing rails.
- Basic space: 1 construction point per rail token.
- Tunnel/ferry space: 2 construction points; if only 1 is spent, place token sideways as a reminder.
- Place an ownership token on the first rail of each new line you start.
- If you have ≤1 rail token left, you may pay 1 coin to gain 5 rail tokens (optional during this action).
- You cannot start a new line while having an unfinished one unless it's completed.
- Use your "rails under construction" token as a reminder until the line is finished.

**b) Ride the Train**
- Move your train up to 2 cities (up to 3 after flipping train mat).
- Movement rules:
  - Free on your own or state-owned lines.
  - Pay 1 coin to the owner to use their line; convert it to state-owned (remove ownership token).
- Collect 2 coins if your train is the first to reach or pass through one of the 9 edge cities with coins.
- Fulfill a travel route by reaching or passing through its destination city:
  - Place both city cards face down on your score pile.
- Pick up a new travel route only if:
  - Your coach is empty.
  - Your train is in, reaches, or passes through a city that is the top or center card of a displayed travel route.
  - Choose one of the two valid pairs from that column.
- At the end of the action, refill the public display to 6 travel routes.

**c) Take Rail Tokens**
- Take 5 rail tokens from the general supply.
- Only available if you have ≤1 rail token in stock and did not or cannot pay 1 coin during Build Rails.

#### Phase Progression
- After depleting deck "I": each player adds coach mat "II" — now can carry 2 travel routes.
- After depleting deck "II": each player flips train mat to side "II" — now can move up to 3 cities.

#### Finish
- After deck "III" is depleted, players may withdraw from the game during their turn after performing Ride the Train.
- You may withdraw even if you have unfulfilled routes (return them to the box; no reward).
- If you fulfill your last route during withdrawal, gain 1 coin.
- You cannot withdraw if you picked up a new route this turn.
- After withdrawal:
  - Your train is removed.
  - Each time your turn comes, gain 1 coin.
- Game ends when all players have withdrawn. Remaining players (up to the right of first player) gain 1 coin.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Railway Lines**: Owned by players (marked with ownership token), state-owned (free for all), or under construction.
- **Ownership Conversion**: Paying 1 coin to use another player's line converts it to state-owned.
- **Network Connectivity**: You can only build on lines reachable by your train via completed rails.
- **Travel Routes**: Always two cards; picked from three-card columns; order fixed.
- **Progression**: Gains from deck progression — second coach, then faster train.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
At the end of the game, score:
- 5 victory points for the first fulfilled card of each city.
- 2 victory points for each additional card of the same city.
- 3 victory points per coin.

**Winning**: Highest score wins. Tiebreakers:
1. Most different cities (i.e., most unique city cards).
2. If still tied, players share the win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I build on another player’s unfinished line?**  
  Yes, if your train can reach it. The line remains theirs; they keep ownership.
- **Can I move through a city with another player’s train?**  
  Yes. Trains can occupy the same city.
- **Can I pick up a travel route during Build Rails or Take Rail Tokens?**  
  No. Only during Ride the Train, and only if conditions are met.
- **What if I run out of rail tokens?**  
  Use Take Rail Tokens or pay 1 coin during Build Rails to gain more.
- **Can I discard a travel route?**  
  No. Must fulfill it to clear the coach.
- **Do I need to complete all travel routes?**  
  No. Unfulfilled routes when withdrawing are returned to the box.
