## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players represent entrepreneurs building airship companies in the early 20th century. The goal is to score the most Victory Points (VP) by acquiring airship and expansion cards, and optionally contributing to the construction of the Hindenburg. Victory Points come from gold stars on cards and Hindenburg construction phases.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Game Board (featuring the Hindenburg and spaces for airship and expansion cards)  
- 4 Player (Company) Boards  
- 18 Airship Cards (6 dark blue/Era 2, 6 medium blue/Era 1, 6 light blue/starter)  
- 48 Expansion Cards (divided by color: purple/Financiers, brown/Captains, orange/Engineers, blue/Materials, yellow/Hangars, green/Engines)  
- 1 "Change of Era" Card  
- 4 Entrepreneur Cards (one per player, country-themed but functionally identical)  
- 24 Bonus Chips (6 per player)  
- 9 Dice:  
  - 3 White: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3  
  - 3 Red: 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5  
  - 3 Black: 4, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8  
- 1 Wooden Airship Token (grants +1 to rolls)

### 3. Setup  
- **Airship Cards**:  
  - Shuffle each of the three colored decks (dark blue, medium blue, light blue).  
  - Place 4 cards of each color face-up in 4 stacks on the board, light blue on top, then medium, dark blue on bottom.  
  - Remove remaining 6 airship cards from the game.  

- **Expansion Deck**:  
  - Place shuffled dark blue (Era 2) cards face-down at the bottom.  
  - Place "Change of Era" card on top.  
  - Place shuffled medium blue (Era 1) cards on top of that.  
  - Shuffle light blue (Starter) cards and deal 1 to each player.  
  - Place remaining starter cards on the main board in matching color spots.  
  - Draw from the expansion deck to fill the main board until there are 6 expansion cards visible.  

- **Player Setup**:  
  - Each player takes a company board and chooses an entrepreneur card, placing it face-up on the board (side I showing).  
  - Starting side I provides 1 white die.  
  - Place the dealt starter expansion card on the matching color spot on the player board.  
  - All players start with 2 white dice (1 from entrepreneur card, 1 from starter card).  

- **Start Player**:  
  - Oldest player starts.  
  - Start player receives 3 bonus chips; all others receive 4.  
  - Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn consists of **two mandatory steps**, followed by an optional extra turn:

#### Step 1: Draw an Expansion Card  
- Draw the top card from the expansion deck.  
- Place it in the leftmost empty space of its color row on the main board.  
- If the row is full, discard the leftmost card, shift others left, and place the new card on the rightmost spot.  
- If the drawn card is the **"Change of Era" card**:  
  - All players immediately flip their entrepreneur cards to side II (which adds 1 red die to each player’s pool).  
  - Remove the "Change of Era" card from the game.  
- If the deck is empty, skip this step.

#### Step 2: Acquire a Card  
- **Declare Target**: Choose one of the following:  
  - A visible expansion card on the main board  
  - A top airship card from any of the 4 stacks  
  - A Hindenburg construction phase (if available — see below)  

- **Check Requirements**:  
  - The top-left of the card shows required dice (color and quantity).  
  - The top-right shows the target score to meet or exceed.  
  - The player must have **at least** the required dice available.  

- **Available Dice**:  
  - Determined by:  
    - Entrepreneur card (side I or II)  
    - All expansion cards on player board  
    - Fixed dice from Engineer cards (orange) count as available but are not rolled  
  - Maximum of **3 dice per color** may be rolled (fixed Engineer dice do not count toward this limit).  

- **Optional Exchange (via Materials Cards)**:  
  - Before rolling, player may use a blue Materials card to exchange dice (e.g., 3 white → 2 red).  
  - Only one exchange per turn, as specified by the Materials card.  

- **Roll Dice**:  
  - Roll all selected dice once. Only one roll allowed.  
  - If more dice of a color are rolled than required, use the highest values.  

- **Calculate Result**:  
  - Sum only the dice that match the required types.  
  - Apply bonuses (if desired):  
    - Spend 1 bonus chip: +1 (max 1 per roll)  
    - Own the wooden airship: +1  
    - Engine cards (green): +1 or +2 to rolls involving specified color (grey = any color)  

- **Success**:  
  - If total ≥ target score:  
    - Take the card and place it on the matching color spot on your board.  
    - Discard any existing card in that spot (removed from game).  
    - If airship card: take the wooden airship token.  
    - If Hindenburg phase: place one of your bonus chips on the completed phase (from supply; if none, use one from your board). Take the wooden airship.  
    - Receive one-time bonuses (e.g., Captains give bonus chips, Financiers give dice).  

- **Failure**:  
  - If total < target, even after bonuses:  
    - Gain 1 bonus chip from the supply (if available).  

#### Optional: Additional Turn  
- After completing both steps, a player may pay **3 bonus chips** to take another full turn (draw + acquire).  
- Can be done multiple times if chips allow.

#### Hindenburg Construction  
- **Availability**: When **any one** of the 4 airship stacks is exhausted, the Hindenburg becomes available.  
- **Acquisition**: Treated like acquiring a card — player declares intent, meets dice and score requirements shown on the board.  
- **Token**: First player to succeed takes a bonus chip and places it on the phase.  
- **Wooden Airship**: From this point on, **only** the player who completes a Hindenburg phase receives the wooden airship.  
- **Limits**: Each of the 4 phases can only be completed once.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Dice Rolling**: Central mechanic for acquiring cards.  
- **Dice Pool**: Built from entrepreneur and expansion cards.  
- **Max 3 Dice per Color**: Hard limit on rolled dice; fixed Engineer dice exempt.  
- **Materials Exchange**: One pre-roll exchange allowed via blue cards.  
- **Bonuses**:  
  - Bonus chip: +1 (spend 1, max 1 per roll)  
  - Wooden airship: +1 (persistent while held)  
  - Engine cards: +1/+2 to rolls with matching color  
- **Card Replacement**: New expansion cards replace old ones in same color slot (old removed).  
- **Turn Continuation**: Pay 3 chips for extra turn(s).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Game Triggers** (checked after each turn):  
  - Only one or zero airship cards remain on each of the 4 airship stacks.  
  - OR the fourth Hindenburg construction phase is completed.  

- **Scoring**:  
  - Count VP from:  
    - Gold stars on **all expansion cards** currently on player board  
    - Gold stars on **all airship cards** owned  
    - Hindenburg construction phases:  
      - If Hindenburg is **fully completed** (all 4 phases): use higher VP value  
      - If **incomplete**: use lower VP value  

- **Winning**:  
  - Highest VP total wins.  
  - **Tiebreaker**: Most airships (each airship card = 1; each Hindenburg phase = 1 airship equivalent).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I roll more than 3 of a color?**  
  No. Max 3 of each color may be rolled. Extra dice may be rolled but only best matching required number are used.  

- **Do Engineer dice count toward the 3-dice limit?**  
  No. Fixed dice are not rolled and do not count toward the limit.  

- **Can I use multiple Engine cards?**  
  Yes. All applicable Engine bonuses apply (e.g., +1 red, +2 black, +1 grey = total +4 if red/black dice used).  

- **What happens to VP on discarded expansion cards?**  
  Lost. Only cards on your board at game end count.  

- **Can I acquire a Hindenburg phase even if I don’t have required dice?**  
  No. You must meet or exceed required dice types.  

- **Can I take an extra turn after failing?**  
  Yes. Extra turn is allowed regardless of success or failure.  

- **Does wooden airship reset after Hindenburg phase?**  
  Yes. It transfers to the next player who completes a Hindenburg phase.  

- **Can I use a Materials card to get dice I don’t have?**  
  Yes — that’s their purpose. Exchange allows access to otherwise unavailable dice.
