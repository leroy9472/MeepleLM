## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Players take turns placing land tiles and deploying settlers to claim and complete features such as trails, towns, farms, and plains. The goal is to earn the most points through completed and incomplete features during and at the end of the game.

2. **Components**  
- Game board with starting spaces  
- Land tiles (quantity not specified)  
- Settlers (6 per player)  
- Scoring track (with markers)  
- Explorers (2 per player)  

3. **Setup**  
1. Place the game board so the starting spaces face the center.  
2. Shuffle all land tiles and form several face-down stacks within reach of all players.  
3. Each player takes 6 settlers.  
   - Place one settler on your scoring marker (located at the lower left of the scoring track).  
   - Place your 2 explorers on any 2 of the starting spaces on the board.  

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
On your turn, perform the following actions in order:  
1. **Draw and Place a Tile**  
   - Draw one land tile and place it adjacent to an existing tile or starting space.  
   - All features on the connecting edges must match (e.g., road to road, field to field).  

2. **Deploy a Settler (Optional)**  
   - You may place 1 settler from your supply onto the tile you just placed.  
   - The settler must be placed on a feature not already claimed by another player.  
   - Types of settlers:  
     - **Shopkeeper** – on a town/city  
     - **Robber** – on a road/trail  
     - **Trapper** – on a green field/plains  
     - **Farmer** – on a farm  

3. **Score Completed Features**  
   - If placing the tile completes one or more features, score them immediately:  
     - **Robber (Road)**: 1 point per road tile + 2 points per trading post on the trail  
     - **Shopkeeper (Town)**: 2 points per town tile + 2 points per flag in the town  
       - Tie Rule: If multiple players have shopkeepers in the same completed town, all tied players score full points.  
     - **Farmer (Farm)**: Scores 9 points when the farm is completely surrounded (i.e., fully enclosed by towns/roads)  
   - After scoring:  
     - Move the easternmost explorer one column to the west.  
     - **Settler Bonus**: For each explorer on the same column as a player's settler, that player scores 4 points per explorer.  
     - **Remove Settlers**: Standing settlers (robbers, shopkeepers, farmers — not trappers) that are behind the easternmost explorer are removed from the board.  
   - **Plains (Trappers)**: Trappers (placed lying down) are not scored during the game; only scored at the end.  

4. **Alternate Turns**  
- Play proceeds clockwise to the next player.  

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Tile Placement**: Must match adjacent features; must be placed adjacent to a starting space or existing tile.  
- **Settler Deployment**: One per turn, only on the newly placed tile, only on unclaimed features.  
- **Scoring Triggers**: Features are scored only when completed by tile placement.  
- **Explorer Movement**: After each scoring event, the easternmost explorer moves one column west.  
- **Settler Removal**: Standing settlers behind the easternmost explorer are removed.  
- **Tie Rules**: Apply to towns and trapper areas — all tied players score full points.  

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- **End Condition**: The game ends on the turn when the last land tile is placed.  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - **Incomplete Trails**: 1 point per tile  
  - **Incomplete Towns**: 2 points per tile  
  - **Flags in Incomplete Towns**: 1 point per flag  
  - **Incomplete Farms**: 1 point for the farm + 1 point per surrounding land tile  
  - **Trappers (Plains)**: 1 point per animal in the plains segments of the area  
    - Tie Rule: If multiple players have trappers in the same area, all tied players score full points.  

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Ties in Features**: Both players score full points for towns and trapper areas.  
- **Explorer Movement**: Only triggered after scoring a completed feature.  
- **Settler Bonus**: Only applies if a player’s settler is on the same column as an explorer after movement.  
- **Settler Removal**: Only affects standing settlers (robbers, shopkeepers, farmers). Trappers are immune.  
- **Farm Scoring During Game**: Only fully surrounded farms score 9 points during play. Others score at end.  
- **Final Scoring Priority**: All incomplete features and trappers are scored after the last tile is placed.
