### 1. Lore & Objective
Top Race is a racing card game where players compete to win prize money by strategically moving racecars across a track using speed cards. The game captures the tension and excitement of motorsport, where players must balance advancing their own cars while also being forced to move opponents' cars. Victory is achieved by finishing in top positions to earn the most prize money over one or more races.

   - 4 players: 12 cards each
   - 5 players: 9 cards each (3 cards returned to box)

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Auction Phase**: 
   - 6 auctions are held—one for each racecar.
   - Starting bid: minimum 10,000 Top Race Euros, in increments of 10,000.
   - Bidding proceeds clockwise; once a player passes, they cannot re-enter unless they haven’t yet acquired a car.
   - Winner pays the bank, selects a racecar, places it on a starting space of choice, and becomes start player if it’s the first auction.
   - Players must own at least one car. If a player has none by the last auction, they must buy the final car for 30,000.

2. **Race Phase**:
   - Players take turns clockwise, each playing one speed card per turn.
   - The played card shows one or more racecars with movement values (1–6 or 10).
   - All cars on the card must be moved in top-to-bottom order.
   - Movement is forward (straight or diagonal); lane changes allowed unless blocked.
   - Cars must move the full number of spaces if possible. If blocked, move as far as possible; remaining movement is lost.
   - After movement, discard the card to the discard pile.

3. **Special Cards**:
   - **White Jokers**: A white racecar on a card allows the player to move any one racecar not already on the card.
     - Cannot move a car already pictured on the same card.
     - Can target a finished or broken-down car (but movement is lost).
   - **Sprint/Breakdown Cards** (3 total: blue/red, yellow/black, lilac/green):
     - Can be used as **Sprint** or **Breakdown**.
     - **Sprint**: The trailing of the two pictured cars moves forward until level with the leading one, if path is clear. If blocked, stops just before the obstruction.
     - **Breakdown**: The leading of the two cars is removed from the track and placed beside it. It returns when the trailing car reaches or passes its position. Owner places it on an adjacent free space or the next available space behind.

4. **Finish Line Rules**:
   - As cars cross the finish line, place them in order: 1st, 2nd, etc.
   - Prize money awarded: 1st: 200,000; 2nd: 150,000; 3rd: 100,000; 4th: 75,000; 5th: 50,000; 6th: 25,000.
   - If all speed cards are played before all cars finish:
     - Rank remaining cars by position (frontmost space wins; if tied, inside position wins).
   - Once 5 cars finish, the 6th is automatically placed last.
   - Players whose cars have all finished discard remaining cards and exit the race.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Speed Cards**: Drive movement; often force movement of opponents.
- **Blocking**: Strategic lane placement to hinder opponents in curves and chicanes.
- **Jokers**: Flexible movement tool, but restricted from choosing cars already on the card.
- **Sprint/Breakdown**: Tactical choice to boost one car or hinder another.
- **Turn Order**: Determined by auction; start player from first auction begins.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- After all placements are determined, distribute prize money.
- Game ends after one race or multiple races.
- In multi-race games:
  - Re-auction cars.
  - Re-deal speed cards.
  - Players retain accumulated money.
- Winner: Player with most money after final race.
- Tiebreaker: Not specified in source.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use a joker on a finished car?** Yes, but movement is lost.
- **Can I use Sprint/Breakdown if one car has finished?** No, both cars must still be on track.
- **Can I move a car sideways on curves?** Only if the adjacent space is further forward than current space.
- **What if all spaces beside a broken-down car are occupied?** Place it on the next free space behind.
- **Can I bid after passing?** Only if you haven’t yet acquired a car.
- **Can I use a Sprint if the path is blocked?** Yes, move as far as possible, stopping just before the block.
