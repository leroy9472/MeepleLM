## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Progress: Evolution of Technology*, players guide a civilization through human history, advancing from early tools to the Industrial Revolution. The goal is to accumulate the most Victory Points (VP) by researching and developing technologies across three eras: Antiquity (Age I), Middle Ages (Age II), and Renaissance (Age III). Players enhance their nation’s capabilities by upgrading skills, advancing on Power Tracks, and completing key milestones.

### 2. Components
- 184 Technology Cards (divided into Ages I–III, and Age IV in expansion)
- 56 Knowledge Tokens (Science, Engineering, Culture, General)
- 5 Player Boards (track Skills and VP)
- 11 Age Tokens (mark progression triggers)
- 100 Wooden Markers (14 per player color, 30 black markers)
- 1 Power Board (double-sided; tracks Prestige, Population, Army)
- 5 Summary Sheets (Tech Tree reference)
- 5 Info Cards
- Rulebook

*Expansions include:*
- **Personalities**: 15 Personality cards (5 Ancient Philosophers, 5 Medieval Scientists, 5 Renaissance Artists)

2. **Prepare Decks**:
   - Separate Technology Cards into Age I, II, and III decks. Shuffle each.
   - Place Age I deck next to Power Board with discard space. Set aside Age II and III.

3. **Player Setup**:
   - Each player takes a Player Board and markers of one color.
   - Place one marker on the starting space of each Skill Track.
   - Place one marker of each color on the starting space of each Power Track (Prestige, Population, Army) on the Power Board.

- **Industrial Revolution**: Set aside Age IV deck.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn has three phases:

#### 1. Development Phase
- Remove one black marker from each Technology under Development.
- If a card has no markers left, it becomes **Active**:
  - Gain all benefits immediately (skills, tokens, Power Track, VP).
  - May trigger new Age or end game.
- Player may take back any Technologies under Development into hand.

#### 2. Action Phase
Take a number of actions equal to **Action Skill** level. Possible actions:

- **Discover**:
  - Play a card from hand as Active Technology.
  - Pay cost in Knowledge (discard cards or spend tokens) OR meet prerequisite.
  - Costs are per line and must be fulfilled separately.
  - General Knowledge can substitute any type.
  - Unused Knowledge carries over within turn.

- **Research**:
  - Place card from hand as Technology under Development.
  - Place number of black markers equal to **Research Skill**.
  - Cannot exceed **Development Skill** limit.
  - Can use as prerequisite immediately.

- **Draw**:
  - Draw number of cards equal to **Draw Skill**.
  - Must draw one at a time, choosing from any open deck or discard pile.
  - Ends turn after draw.

- **Quick Draw (X/Y)**:
  - Draw X cards (one at a time, from any open deck/discard).
  - Then discard Y cards from hand (any chosen cards).
  - Discarding here does **not** generate Knowledge.
  - Must discard to correct Age discard pile.

- **Shuffle & Draw**:
  - Perform number of times equal to **Shuffle Skill**:
    - Shuffle a discard pile into its Age deck.
    - Draw top card of that deck.
  - Can repeat same deck.
  - If no discard, skip shuffle and draw.

#### 3. Upkeep Phase
- Discard down to **Hand Size Skill** limit.
- Flip all used (gray-side up) Knowledge Tokens back to colored side.

### 5. Core Mechanics

- **Bottom**:
  - VP scored at end of game.

*All benefits apply immediately.*

#### New Age Progression

    - 1: 1 player
    - 2: 2–3 players
    - 3: 4–5 players
  - Game ends immediately.
  - Remove all Technologies under Development.

- **Automatic End**:
  - If current Age deck and discard are both empty, Age ends.
  - If in Age III, game ends.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
Final scoring:
1. **Power Tracks**:
   - Prestige: 1st = 10 VP, 2nd = 6, 3rd = 3, 4th = 1
   - Population: 1st = 11, 2nd = 7, 3rd = 4, 4th = 2
   - Army: 1st = 12, 2nd = 7, 3rd = 3, 4th = 1
   - **Ties**: Average VP of tied positions, rounded down. All tied players receive same VP.

2. **Player Board VP**:
   - Count all VP symbols ( ) to the left of markers on Skill Tracks.

3. **Active Technology Cards**:
   - Sum all VP on bottom of active cards.

4. **Expansion Scoring**:
   - **Industrial Revolution**:
     - 1 VP per 5 Science Technologies
     - 1 VP per 5 Engineering Technologies
     - 1 VP per 5 Culture Technologies
   - **Milestones**:
     - Player with most markers on completed Milestone keeps card (if not tied).
     - Gain VP and benefits at end.
     - Others gain benefits only.
   - **Personalities**:
     - Score VP on Personality card in play at end.

**Tiebreakers (in order)**:
1. General Knowledge Tokens
2. Culture Knowledge Tokens
3. Science Knowledge Tokens
4. Engineering Knowledge Tokens
If still tied, players share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you exceed Development Skill during Research?**  
  No. Total Technologies under Development must not exceed Development Skill.

- **Can a Technology under Development be used as prerequisite?**  
  Yes.

- **Can you use a Skill upgrade during your turn immediately?**  
  Yes. E.g., gaining +1 Action Skill allows an extra action this turn.

- **What happens to Age I cards when Age III starts?**  
  All non-active Age I cards (in hand or under development) are removed.

- **Can you perform multiple Shuffle & Draw actions?**  
  No. Shuffle & Draw is a single action type. You perform the sequence (shuffle + draw) a number of times equal to your Shuffle Skill.
