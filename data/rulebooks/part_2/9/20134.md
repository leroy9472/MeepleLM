### 1. Lore & Objective

In *The End of the Triumvirate*, players take on the roles of Caesar (red), Pompeius (blue), or Crassus (black) during a fictionalized version of 56 B.C., after the collapse of the historical First Triumvirate. The Roman Republic is in turmoil, and the three rivals vie for supremacy through political influence, military conquest, or mastery of both domains.

**Victory Conditions (choose one):**
- **Political Victory**: Be elected Consul twice, **or** be a former Consul with 6 aligned citizens in your section of the Forum.
- **Military Victory**: Control 9 provinces.

The game ends immediately when any player achieves one of these conditions.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

Each turn consists of three phases:

#### I. Supply Phase
1. **Flip Governor Positions**: Move all your Governors between inside/outside the supply box.  
   - Exception: Governors on Civil Servants stay in place (supply box remains visible).
2. **Collect Provincial Supplies**: For each province where the supply box is **visible** (Governor outside):
   - **Political (yellow)**: +2 Gold (placed in province)
   - **Military (brown)**: +2 Legions (placed in province)
   - **Competence (red)**: +1 Gold and +1 Legion (placed in province)
   - If you are **in** a Political or Competence province, collected Gold goes directly to your reserve.
3. **Receive Supplies from Rome**: Choose one:
   - 2 Gold (anywhere)
   - 2 Legions (placed together or separately)
   - 1 Gold and 1 Legion

> Supplies are limited. If unavailable, you may skip or adjust.

#### II. Movement Phase
- You have **4 movement points**.
- Move your Character piece to adjacent regions (sharing border or connected by arrow, including sea routes).
- Each move to an adjacent region costs **1 movement point**.
- **Sea movement**: Costs 1 point per sea region.  
  - If **not carrying legions**, first sea region crossed is **free**.
- You may carry:
  - Any number of Legions (no extra cost)
  - Any number of Civil Servants (free)
- **Entering a province with gold**: Collect it immediately into your reserve.
- **Entering enemy province with ≥1 Legion**: Triggers an attack (see Attack Procedure).
- You may make **multiple attacks** in one turn if movement allows.
- **You cannot end your turn at sea.**

#### III. Action Phase
- Perform up to **3 actions**.
- Cost increases: 1st action = 1 gold, 2nd = 2 gold, 3rd = 3 gold (total 6 for all three).
- Actions depend on **province type where your Character is**:

**Political Province:**
- Improve political competence by 1.
- Align a Citizen from neutral ("Ali") to your section, **or** de-align a Citizen from another player to neutral.  
  - Costs **+2 gold** if you are not leading in political competence.

**Military Province:**
- Improve military competence by 1.
- Add 2 of your Weapons to the Battle Bag.  
  - Costs **+2 gold** if you are not leading in military competence.

**Competence Province:**
- Improve **either** military or political competence by 1.

> "Leading" = having the highest competence level. Two players may tie for lead; all three cannot lead unless all are at VII.

### 5. Core Mechanics

**Attack Procedure:**
- Trigger: Move into enemy province with ≥1 Legion.
- Cannot attack a player with only 1 province left.

1. **Draw Weapons**: Draw **min(3, lowest legion count involved)** cubes from Battle Bag.
2. **Resolve Results**:
   - Your color: Defender loses 1 legion per cube.
   - Opponent’s color: Attacker loses 1 legion per cube.
   - Third color (neutral): Return to bag, no effect, no redraw.
3. **Character Protection**: If defender’s Character is present, attacker loses 2 legions (or all remaining if <2).
4. **Eliminate Equal Numbers**: Remove same number of legions from both sides until one side has none.
5. **Determine Outcome**:
   - **Attacker wins**: At least 1 attacking legion remains.
   - **Defender wins**: No attacking legions remain (even if defender has none).

**After Attack:**
- **Failed Attack**: Attacker retreats to previous province (no movement cost).
- **Successful Conquest**:
  - Replace defender’s Governor with your own (same supply state).
  - Defender receives Compensation Card I:
    - First time: Put 1 of their Weapons into Battle Bag.
    - If already holding Card I: Flip to Card II and increase **one** competence by 1.
  - If province had a Civil Servant:
    - It now belongs to attacker.
    - Defender may put **1 additional Weapon** into Battle Bag (if available).
  - **Escape**: If defender’s Character was in province:
    - Use Escape Card: move Character to any own province (no movement cost).
    - Lose 1 level in **each competence where they were leading**.

**End of Turn:**
1. **Legion Cap**: Reduce any province with >6 legions to 6; return extras to supply.
2. **Advance Calendar Stone**: Move one space toward ELEGIO.
3. **Election Check**: If Calendar Stone reaches ELEGIO:
   - Elect new Consul:
     - Player with most Citizens in Forum wins.
     - Tie: Player whose turn was **earliest** (i.e., waited longest) wins.
   - **If Consul already held office**: Second election = **Political Victory**.
   - **First election**:
     - Receive Consul Card and 1 new Civil Servant (place in any own province).
     - Give speech (narrative).
     - Return 3 of your Citizens to neutral section.
   - Reset Calendar Stone to VIII (3 players) or VII (2 players).
   - Next player’s turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

Game ends **immediately** when any player meets one of:
- **Political Victory**: 
  - Elected Consul twice, **or**
  - Former Consul with 6 Citizens in Forum.
- **Military Victory**: Controls 9 provinces (i.e., has placed all 9 Governors).
- **Competence Victory**: Military and political competence both at VII.

Only one winner. Game does not continue after victory condition is met.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can you move without taking actions?** Yes. Movement and actions are independent.
- **Can you skip supply collection?** Yes, but not movement or Calendar Stone.
- **What if no legions are available during supply phase?** You may choose not to take them.
- **Can you carry multiple Civil Servants?** Yes, and they can be left unplaced.
- **Ties in competence**: Two players may lead; all three cannot lead unless all at VII.
- **Election tiebreaker**: The player who has **not had a turn most recently** wins (i.e., turn order priority: earliest in order wins).
- **Can you attack and fail, then move elsewhere?** Yes, you may use all 4 movement points regardless of attack outcomes.
- **What happens to weapons in the bag?** They stay unless drawn and returned after use (neutral) or awarded as compensation.
