## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Players are citizens of Keydom, competing to develop the most valuable land holdings under the oversight of Keywood, ruler of Keydom. The objective is to score the most points by strategically placing field tiles, harvesting crops, and using workers effectively. Points are earned through:  
- Worker tile values on the board at game end.  
- Size of the largest and second-largest connected groups of field tiles (1 point per tile in the largest, 2 per tile in the second largest).  
- Having the most crop counters of each type at game end (1 point per crop type, 5 total possible).  
The player with the highest score wins, with tiebreakers favoring more field tiles, then more crop counters.

2. **Components**  
- 4 country boards (56 hex spaces each)  
- 56 double-sided field tiles (unique alpha-numeric reference per tile, crop symbol on each side)  
- 60 wooden crop counters: 12 each in brown (hops), green (vegetables), orange (cider apples), red (barrels of wine), yellow (wheat)  
- 24 farmhand tiles (6 per player, numbered 1–3)  
- 6 townsfolk tiles (numbered 4 or 5)  
- 4 player screens  
- 4 store cards  
- 4 turn option cards  
- 14 event tiles  
- 1 cloth bag (used for drawing tiles and passing to indicate turn order)  
- 1 town board with:  
  - Land registry (6 spaces for field tiles)  
  - Event track (10 spaces, 7th marked with "?")  
  - Scoring track  
  - Fallow fields area (for discarded tiles)

3. **Setup**  
- Place town board in center.  
- Each player takes:  
  - One country board  
  - One screen, store card, turn option card  
  - 6 farmhand tiles in their color  
- Place country boards near town board.  
- Place 6 townsfolk tiles on designated spaces of town board.  
- **Starting field tiles**:  
  - 4 pairs of field tiles with colored alpha-numeric references exist.  
  - One of each pair is placed in the bag.  
  - Each player draws one from the bag, then takes the matching second tile of the same color.  
  - Place both tiles on country board at matching coordinates.  
- **Crop counters at start**:  
  - 2 players: 6 counters in bag (2 of one color, 1 each of other four); each player takes 3 (including one of the doubled color).  
  - 3 players: 9 counters in bag (1 of one color, 2 of each other); each player secretly draws 3.  
  - 4 players: 12 counters in bag (3 of two colors, 2 of three others); each player secretly draws 3.  
  - Remaining counters form general supply.  
- Draw 6 field tiles from bag and place face up (large crop symbol up) on land registry spaces.  
- Event tiles:  
  - 2 players: all 14 in bag.  
  - 3–4 players: remove 2 at random (unseen), place remaining 12 in bag.  
- Designate fallow fields area for discarded tiles.  
- Determine start player:  
  - Each player places a crop counter of their color in the bag.  
  - Player to left of rule-reader draws one; player whose color is drawn chooses start player.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
- Play proceeds clockwise starting with start player.  
- On a turn, a player may take **up to two actions** from the following:  
  a) Harvest crops  
  b) Play or remove a worker tile  
  c) Transfer field tiles from stores to country board  
  d) Place field tiles from registry into store  
- Each action may be taken **only once per turn**.  
- **Restriction**: If action (d) is taken, action (c) cannot be taken afterward.  
- After actions, pass the cloth bag to the left to end turn.

5. **Core Mechanics**  

**Action A: Harvest Crops**  
- Harvest any connected group of unharvested field tiles (tiles showing large crop symbol).  
- Harvested tiles are flipped to show small crop symbol (harvested side).  
- For each harvested tile, take one matching crop counter from supply.  
- If matching counter is unavailable, take any available counter.  
- Worker tiles do **not** connect fields. Harvested tiles within a group do not need to be flipped again.  

**Action B: Play or Remove a Worker Tile**  
- May play or remove **one** worker tile (own farmhand or townsfolk).  
- **Playing a worker**:  
  - Must be adjacent to at least as many field tiles as the number on the tile.  
  - Cannot be adjacent to another worker.  
  - Can be placed in empty space or **replace a lower-numbered worker** (same action).  
  - Replaced worker returns to player’s supply (farmhand) or town board (townsfolk).  
- **Removing a worker**:  
  - Return to personal supply (farmhand) or town board (townsfolk).  
  - Cannot both remove and play a worker in same turn unless replacing (see above).  
- Worker tiles have either:  
  - **Bell**: Action is optional.  
  - **Scroll**: Action is mandatory.  
- Worker tiles do not connect fields.  

**Action C: Transfer Field Tiles from Stores to Country Board**  
- May move 1–2 tiles from **any store** (own or opponent’s) to your country board.  
- **From own store**:  
  - Pay accompanying crop counters to general supply.  
- **From opponent’s store**:  
  - Match opponent’s bid exactly in number and color of crop counters.  
  - Pay counters to opponent; they return all counters (bid + payment) behind their screen.  
- Place tile on matching alpha-numeric space on country board, unharvested side up.  
- **If space has a worker**:  
  - Remove worker.  
  - May immediately reposition it (if legal placement exists) and trigger its action again (bonus, not part of turn actions).  
  - If cannot reposition, return worker to supply/board.  

**Action D: Place Tiles from Registry into Store**  
- May place 1–2 tiles from registry into your store (max 2 in store at any time).  
- Place one tile at a time.  
- After placing, place a **bid** (1+ crop counters) next to it. Bid is permanent.  
- After placing first tile, refill registry immediately.  
- **Refill process**:  
  - Draw from bag.  
  - If field tile: place face up in registry.  
  - If event tile: resolve immediately (see below), then draw until field tile is drawn.  
- Bidding allows player to later claim tile (by paying bid to supply) or sell to opponent.

**Event Tiles**  
- Drawn when refilling registry or via worker/event effects.  
- Placed on next available space on Event Track (1–10).  
- Affect **all players**, resolved in clockwise order starting with drawer.  
- **Seventh event tile** (on "?" space):  
  - All players check if they have at least 7 total tiles (field + worker) on board.  
  - If **any** player has fewer than 7:  
    - Remove event tiles from spaces 1 and 2, return to bag.  
    - Shift remaining tiles down (3→1, 4→2, etc.).  
  - Repeat this check every time a tile is placed on "?".  
- If event tile is drawn during event resolution:  
  - Announce it, set aside.  
  - After current event resolves, return it to bag.  
- After 10th event tile is placed, game ends after two full rounds.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- Game ends when **10th event tile** is placed.  
- The player who drew it finishes their turn.  
- Then, all players take **two more turns** (ending with drawer’s second turn).  
- During final turns:  
  - Field tiles drawn normally (to refill registry).  
  - **Event tiles drawn are ignored** (set aside, not resolved).  
- **Scoring steps**:  
  1. **Worker tiles**:  
     - Score value on each worker tile on country board.  
     - Remove tiles after scoring.  
  2. **Largest connected group of field tiles**:  
     - Score **1 point per tile**.  
  3. **Second largest connected group**:  
     - Score **2 points per tile**.  
     - Groups must be separate (no overlapping).  
  4. **Crop counters**:  
     - For each of 5 crop types, **1 point to player with most**.  
     - No points for ties.  
     - Only counters **behind screen** count.  
     - Counters in stores, on tiles, or in supply do not count.  
- **Final scoring**: Use scoring track.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Most field tiles on board.  
  2. Most crop counters behind screen.  
  - If still tied, replay.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can you harvest a single unconnected tile?** Yes.  
- **Can worker tiles be adjacent to harvested fields?** Yes. Only field adjacency matters, not harvest state.  
- **Can you replace a worker with a higher-numbered one and use its action?** No. Only when a **field tile replaces a worker** can you reposition and reactivate.  
- **Can you play a worker with no adjacent fields?** Only if number is 0 (none exist). Minimum adjacency is based on number.  
- **Do unharvested tiles score?** Yes, they count for group size, but only if part of a connected group.  
- **Can you have more than 2 tiles in store?** No. Max is 2.  
- **What happens if you can’t refill registry?** If bag is empty, leave space empty. Game continues.  
- **Can you use crop counters gained from repositioning in same turn?** Yes, if gained during action (e.g., from replacing worker when placing tile), they can be used in second action.
