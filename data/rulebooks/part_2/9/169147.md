## LETTER TYCOON — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Letter Tycoon*, players build words to earn money and stocks. By purchasing letter patents, players gain ownership of letters and collect royalties when others use them. Some patents grant special abilities that enhance word-building power. The game ends when a player owns patents of sufficient value (per the goal card). Victory is determined by the total value of patents, coins, and stocks.

### 2. Components  
- 102 Letter Factory Cards (letter cards used to form words)  
- 26 Letter Patents (one for each letter A–Z; grants royalties and some special abilities)  
- 35 Coins (in-game currency)  
- 18 Stock Certificates  
- 5 Scorecards (track player scores)  
- 4 Goal Cards (set end-game trigger based on player count)  
- 1 Zeppelin Token (marks starting player)  
- 1 Letter Factories Poster (8.5" x 14", reference only)  

### 3. Setup  
A. **Determine Starting Player**:  
- Each player cuts the Letter Factory deck.  
- The player revealing the card closest to "Z" (Z > Y > X, etc.) becomes the starting player and takes the zeppelin token.  

B. **Deal Cards and Set Up**:  
- Shuffle the Letter Factory deck.  
- Deal 7 cards face-down to each player.  
- Reveal 3 community factory cards face-up in the center.  
- Place the rest of the deck beside the community pool; leave space for a discard pile.  

C. **Lay Out Patents and Supplies**:  
- Place all 26 Letter Patents in a visible row or grid (A–Z recommended).  
- Place coins and stock certificates in a shared supply within reach.  

D. **Distribute Player Aids**:  
- Give each player a scorecard.  
- Set the Goal Card corresponding to player count:  
  - 2 players: $45  
  - 3 players: $34  
  - 4 players: $26  
  - 5 players: $21  

E. **Dictionary Agreement**:  
- Players must agree on a dictionary (paper or digital) to resolve challenges.  
- Valid words: at least 3 letters, not abbreviations, proper nouns, or requiring hyphens/apostrophes. All parts of speech allowed.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, choose **one** of two actions:

#### Option 1: DISCARD  
- Discard any number of cards from your hand.  
- Draw the same number from the deck.  
- Turn ends.

#### Option 2: PLAY A WORD  
Follow these steps in order:

**A. Build a Word**  
- Use cards from your hand and/or the community pool.  
- At least **one letter** in the word must come from your hand.  
- You may use special abilities from patents you own (once per turn).  
- 'Y' must be declared as vowel or consonant when played.  
- 'Q' in the word **doubles** money and stock earned (regardless of patent ownership).  

**B. Earn Money and Stocks**  
- Base earnings based on word length:  

| Letters | Money | Stock |
|--------|-------|-------|
| 3      | $1    | 0     |
| 4      | $2    | 0     |
| 5      | $3    | 1     |
| 6      | $4    | 1     |
| 7      | $5    | 1     |
| 8+     | $5 + $1 per extra letter | 1 + 1 per letter over 7 |

- Example: 8-letter word → $6, 2 stocks; 10-letter word → $8, 4 stocks  
- 'Q' doubles **both** money and stock earned (after base calculation).  
- Patent abilities (e.g., J, K, B) may further double earnings.

**C. Bank Pays Royalties**  
- For each factory card in the played word, opponents with the matching patent receive $1 from the bank.  
- You do **not** pay yourself.  
- Letters added via patent abilities (e.g., Z's 'S') do **not** trigger royalties.

**D. Buy a Patent (Optional)**  
- You may buy **one** patent matching a letter used in your word (from hand or community).  
- Pay the cost shown on the letter card and patent (same value).  
- Place the patent in front of you; you now collect royalties and may use its ability.

**E. Continue Turn**  
1. Replace any used community cards from the deck (restore to 3 face-up).  
2. Discard all cards used to build the word.  
3. Optionally discard any additional cards from your hand.  
4. Draw cards to return to 7 cards in hand.  
   - If the deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Special Patent Abilities (Use Once Per Turn)  
- **B**: Double money and stocks if word begins and ends with vowels.  
- **J**: Double money and stocks if vowels make up at least half the word.  
- **K**: Double money and stocks if word contains only **one** vowel.  
- **Q**: On your turn, **before** deciding action, you may discard and draw 1 card.  
- **X**: Use one letter card **twice** in a word (must use at least 3 distinct factory cards).  
- **Z**: Add an 'S' to the end of your word if it forms a valid word. No opponent earns royalties on the added 'S'.  
  - You cannot buy the 'S' patent unless you use an 'S' factory card (not just Z's ability).  

#### 'Y' Rule  
- When played, declare 'Y' as **vowel** or **consonant**.  
- Declaration affects eligibility for patent abilities (e.g., K’s “only one vowel”).

#### Challenges  
- After a word is played, **before** next player starts, any player may challenge.  
- Use agreed dictionary.  
- **If word is valid ("Yes")**:  
  - Challenger pays $1 to the active player (from bank if broke).  
- **If word is invalid ("No")**:  
  - Active player takes back played cards.  
  - Returns all money and stocks earned.  
  - Discards one card from hand.  
  - Turn ends immediately.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End Trigger**: When any player owns patents with total value **equal to or greater than** the goal card value, the **last round** begins.  
- **Last Round**:  
  - Starting with the player holding the zeppelin, each player (clockwise) gets **one final turn**.  
  - After the last player acts, the game ends.  

#### Final Scoring  
Each player totals:  
- Value of all owned patents (printed cost)  
- All coins  
- All stocks (1 stock = $1)  

**Winner**: Highest total score.  
**Tiebreaker**: Player with highest patent value wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use multiple patent abilities in one turn?**  
  Yes, if conditions are met (e.g., a 5-letter word with one vowel starting and ending in vowels could trigger K and B).  
- **Does 'Q' double before or after other multipliers?**  
  'Q' doubles the **final** base earnings (after length and patent abilities).  
  Example: 5-letter word with K ability → $3 × 2 = $6; with Q → $6 × 2 = $12.  
- **Can I use Z’s 'S' if it makes a plural but isn’t in the dictionary?**  
  No. The resulting word (with 'S') must be valid per the dictionary.  
- **Can I buy a patent without playing a word?**  
  No. Only during a "Play a Word" action, and only one per turn.  
- **Do I pay royalties for letters used from the community pool?**  
  Yes. Royalties are based on letters played, not source.  
- **Can I use X’s ability with a community card?**  
  Yes. You may use any one card (hand or community) twice. Must use at least 3 distinct factory cards.
