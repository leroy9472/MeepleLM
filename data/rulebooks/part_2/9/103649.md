## The City — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The City is a card-based strategy game in which players act as developers constructing developments to earn victory points and income. The goal is to be the first to reach 50 or more victory points. Once that threshold is met, the game ends immediately, and the player with the most victory points wins.

2. Components  
- 110-card deck of developments  
- Pen and paper for scoring  
- No additional components required

Each card represents a development with the following attributes:  
- Cost (top-left corner, 0–11)  
- Victory points (marked with ⭐)  
- Income (marked with §, measured in card draws)  
- Optional attributes: symbols (喜, 贝, or others), numeric attributes (10, 9, 8, 7), and special rules (e.g., discounts, limits, or conditional effects)

3. Setup  
- Set out one General Contractor card face up per player; remove excess.  
- Choose a dealer. Shuffle the deck.  
- Deal 7 cards face down to each player.  
- Each player selects 5 cards to keep, discards 2 face down (to form initial discard pile).  
- Draw pile is formed from remaining cards.  
- Players begin with 0 victory points.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game lasts 7–9 rounds. Each round has two phases:

**Phase 1: Build or Survey**  
- Simultaneously, each player chooses one of the following:  
  a) Build a development from hand or take a face-up General Contractor  
  b) Survey (if not building)  

- All players reveal their choices simultaneously.  
- Players who build:  
  - Place the development face up in their tableau  
  - Pay cost by discarding cards face down from hand (equal to cost)  
  - Apply any applicable discounts (e.g., from Townhouse Row)  
  - If building Construction Gang, activate its ability immediately  

- Players who survey:  
  - Draw 5 cards from the deck  
  - Add to hand  
  - Discard 4 cards face down (net gain: 1 card)  
  - Cannot build any developments that round (including with Construction Gang)  
  - Still score and receive income normally  

**Phase 2: Score and Receive Income**  
- All players:  
  - Score victory points from all developments in their tableau (including newly built)  
  - Total income (§) and draw that many cards from the draw pile  
  - If draw pile is exhausted, shuffle discard pile to form a new deck and continue drawing  
  - If after reshuffling, there are not enough cards to fulfill all players’ income draws, the game ends immediately with no income drawn  

- Check end game:  
  - If any player has ≥50 victory points, game ends.  
  - Otherwise, players with more than 12 cards in hand must discard down to 12.  
  - Begin next round.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Building Developments**  
- Cost is paid in discarded cards (1 card = 1 wealth).  
- Cards in hand may be used as wealth or built.  
- Discounts (e.g., from Townhouse Row) reduce cost; cumulative; cannot reduce cost below 0.  
- Some developments require prerequisites (e.g., Housing Tracts must be in tableau to build certain cards).  
- "Limit: 1 per player" cards (e.g., Mall) may only be built once per player.  
- Multiple copies of discount cards do not stack the discount effect.  

**Construction Gang**  
- Grants ability to build two developments in a single round (sequentially, after revealing).  
- Both developments must cost 4 or less (before discounts).  
- First built development may affect cost or eligibility of the second.  
- Cannot build General Contractor as one of the two.  
- Cannot be used if player chooses to survey.  

**Surveying**  
- Alternative to building.  
- Net gain: +1 card (draw 5, discard 4).  
- Player still scores VP and receives income.  
- Player with Construction Gang may survey, but cannot build either development that round.  

**Income (§)**  
- Each development provides income in card draws.  
- Total income = sum of all § values in tableau.  
- Draw cards starting with player who has highest VP total if deck is low.  
- Reshuffle discard pile when draw pile is empty.  

**Victory Points (⭐)**  
- Fixed: listed number scored each round.  
- Variable:  
  - Based on number of developments in tableau with specific numeric attribute (10, 9, 8, 7) below cost  
  - Count duplicates (e.g., Amusement Park lists attribute twice → counts twice)  
  - Cards like Central Park include themselves in count  
  - Cards like Luxury Homes score extra for each other copy of the same card in tableau  
  - Cards like Subway System score based on specified symbols in your tableau and one other player’s tableau (chosen by you)  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when:  
  a) Any player has 50 or more victory points at end of round  
  b) After reshuffling, there are not enough cards to fulfill income draws (very rare)  

- Final scoring:  
  - Player with highest victory points wins.  
  - Tiebreaker 1: Most cards in hand (before discarding)  
  - Tiebreaker 2: If still tied, all tied players share the win  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I use a card both as wealth and as a development?  
  A: No. A card is either built or discarded as wealth.  

- Q: Can I build two Construction Gangs?  
  A: Yes, unless a card states "Limit: 1 per player". However, the ability does not stack (you still build only two developments per round).  

- Q: Does a discount apply to General Contractor?  
  A: No. General Contractor is taken from the table, not built, so no cost is paid.  

- Q: Can I survey and use Construction Gang in the same round?  
  A: No. Surveying forfeits all building, including Construction Gang’s double build.  

- Q: When drawing income, what if the deck runs out mid-draw?  
  A: Reshuffle the discard pile to form a new deck. If still insufficient after reshuffling, game ends without drawing.  

- Q: Can I choose myself when a card refers to “another player’s tableau”?  
  A: Yes, unless specified otherwise. For example, Subway System allows you to pick any one other player (including yourself if allowed by wording). But "another" implies different player; thus, you must pick someone else.  

- Q: Do I score victory points during the round I build a development?  
  A: Yes. All developments in tableau at scoring phase are scored, including those built that round.
