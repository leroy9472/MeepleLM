## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Pack & Stack*, players take on the role of movers loading trucks with boxes as efficiently as possible. The objective is to minimize point loss from empty truck space and unloaded boxes. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

### 2. Components  
- **36 Truck Cards** (some sources list 30): Each shows a loading area (footprint) and a height number (1–3 levels).  
- **96 Wooden Boxes/Pieces** in 5 sizes/colors:  
  - Size 1 (e.g., white/green): 30  
  - Size 2 (e.g., grey/yellow): 18–24  
  - Size 3 (e.g., brown/red): 12–18  
  - Size 4 (e.g., turquoise/orange): 12  
  - Size 5 (e.g., purple/blue): 12  
- **5 Dice**: One for each box color/size.  
- **Points Tokens**: Total 69 or more; denominations include 1, 2, 5, 10, 50. Each player starts with 75 points (standard).  
- **3 Reward Cards** (optional):  
  - *Replacing a Truck*: Discard to draw a new truck.  
  - *New Order*: Discard to re-roll dice.  
  - *Voucher*: Discard when scoring; reduces penalty for unloaded boxes to single length (not double).

### 3. Setup  
1. Shuffle Truck Cards into a face-down draw pile; place discard pile nearby.  
2. Place all wooden boxes and remaining points tokens in a shared supply.  
3. Give each player:  
   - 75 points in tokens (common: 1×50, 2×10, 1×5)  
   - Optionally, place 3 Reward Cards face-down near the truck deck.  
4. Youngest player starts; place dice in front of them.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows these steps:

#### 1. Receive Load  
- All players roll the 5 dice simultaneously.  
- Each die indicates how many wooden pieces of that color/size the player must take.  
- Example: Rolling 3 white (size 1), 2 yellow (size 2), etc., means take 3 size-1, 2 size-2, etc.

#### 2. Pick a Truck  
- In 3–4 player games: Each player draws **2** Truck Cards, places them face down in front of themselves (arrow toward self).  
- In 5–6 player games: Each player draws **1** Truck Card.  
- All players flip their card(s) face up simultaneously.  
- All players then grab one truck:  
  - May take any card in front of **another** player.  
  - May instead take the top card from the draw pile.  
  - **Cannot** take their own card.  
- The **last player** to grab a truck **must** take the top card from the draw pile (cannot choose).  
- Unselected cards go to discard pile.

#### 3. Load the Truck  
- All players simultaneously load their wooden pieces onto their chosen truck.  
- Rules:  
  - Boxes must be fully within the white loading area (no overhang).  
  - Max stack height = number on truck card (e.g., “3” = 3 levels).  
  - No gaps under stacked pieces (solid support required).  
  - Pieces may be placed standing up or lying down.  
- No penalty for being slow to finish.

#### 4. Score Points  
Players lose points for inefficiency:

- **Empty Spaces**:  
  - Count how many size-1 (1×1) spaces are unfilled.  
  - Lose **1 point per empty space**.

- **Surplus Boxes** (failed to load):  
  - For each unloaded box, lose **2 × its size** in points.  
  - Sizes: 1=1pt×2, 2=2pts×2, 3=3pts×2, 4=4pts×2, 5=5pts×2.

- **Bonus**:  
  - The player(s) who lost the **fewest points** this round gain **10 bonus points**.  
  - If tied, all tied players receive 10 points.

#### 5. Prepare for Next Round  
- Return all wooden pieces to supply.  
- Discard all used Truck Cards.  
- Rotate starting player (next clockwise).  
- Repeat from Step 1.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Truck Selection**: Competitive real-time grab; last player penalized with forced draw.  
- **Packing Puzzle**: Spatial reasoning under time pressure; balance between speed and efficiency.  
- **Scoring Risk**: Penalty for unused space and leftover boxes; bonus rewards relative efficiency.  
- **Optional Cards**: Reward Cards add strategic depth (reroll, replace truck, reduce penalty).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End**: Immediately after any round where **a player has 0 or fewer points**.  
- **Winner**: The player with the **most points** wins.  
- **Tie**: If multiple players tie for highest score, they **share the victory**.  
- **Negative Scores**: Allowed unless house-ruled otherwise. Final scores may be negative.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I use multiple Reward Cards in one round?**  
  A: Yes, if you have them. Discard and resolve each when applicable.

- **Q: What if the truck draw pile runs out?**  
  A: Reshuffle the discard pile into a new draw pile.

- **Q: Can I re-roll dice using "New Order" after seeing trucks?**  
  A: Yes. Discard "New Order" card before truck selection to re-roll.

- **Q: Can I use "Replacing a Truck" after seeing all trucks?**  
  A: Yes. Discard the card after picking your truck but before loading.

- **Q: Does "perfect load" (no loss) trigger a Reward Card?**  
  A: Yes. If only one player has zero loss, they draw a Reward Card. If multiple, none do.

- **Q: Can you go negative during scoring?**  
  A: Yes. If a player loses more points than they have, they go into negative. This can trigger game end.
