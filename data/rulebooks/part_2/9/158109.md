### 1. Lore & Objective
Each player represents a major Earth-based empire competing to gain control of the Solar System. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) through tile claims, planetary control, and managing crises. VPs are earned during the game and at the end based on income from mines and factories. The player with the most VPs wins.

### 2. Components
- 8 planet boards: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Ganymede, Titan, Kuiper Belt  
- Game tiles (square, various types): Factory, Mine, Windfall, Draw Two Cards, Big Game, Crisis, Tension  
- 3 round Alien tiles  
- Player sets (per color):  
  - 9 infantry  
  - 7 spaceships  
  - 5 tanks  
  - 12 mines  
  - 8 factories  
  - 4 player-specific Game cards  
- Money (currency units, denoted as £)  
- 3 six-sided dice (with skull symbols)  
- Pass card and Pass cubes  
- First Player marker  
- Cloth bag for tiles  

### 3. Setup
1. Arrange planets in a line:  
   Mercury → Venus → Earth & Moon (same position, Earth above Moon) → Mars → Ganymede → Titan → Kuiper Belt  
2. Each player selects a color and takes:  
   - All counters of that color (infantry, spaceships, tanks, mines, factories)  
   - 4 player-specific Game cards  
3. Return unused player sets to the box.  
4. Initial placement:  
   - 4 infantry and 2 spaceships in orbit around Earth  
   - 1 factory on Earth  
5. Each player receives £12. Remaining money forms the bank.  
6. Shuffle the Game cards and deal 2 to each player (6 total starting cards: 4 player cards + 2 drawn).  
7. Place the Pass card with Pass cubes nearby.  
8. Place all square Game tiles in the bag.  
9. Set 3 Alien tiles aside (used during Kuiper Belt crisis).  
10. Each player rolls 3 dice; highest roller (re-roll ties) takes the First Player marker.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game lasts **3 periods**. Each period has **6 phases**:

#### Phase 1 – Place Pass Cubes  
Place **number of players + 2** Pass cubes on the Pass card.

#### Phase 2 – Draw and Place Game Tiles  
- Draw tiles from the bag per the "Number of Tiles Per Planet" chart (not fully specified, but assumed from rulebook).  
- Place tiles face up on corresponding planets.  
- Tiles from previous periods remain.  
- Remove any Crisis tiles on Ganymede and discard them.

#### Phase 3 – Player Actions  
Starting with the First Player and proceeding clockwise, each player takes **one action per turn** until a player takes the **last Pass cube**.

**Available Actions:**

- **Move Military Units**  
  - Move one group (spaceship + any infantry; at least one spaceship) up to **2 planets** along the line.  
  - Earth and Moon are adjacent (1 move between them).  
  - Spaceships carry unlimited infantry. Tanks cannot move unless a card allows it.  
  - No dropping off or picking up en route.  
  - If full movement is not used, may **claim one tile** on the destination planet.  
  - Claiming may use units already in orbit (not necessarily those moved).

- **Claim One Tile**  
  - Move **one unit** from orbit to the planet surface to claim.  
  - **Undefended tiles** (no defense value):  
    - **Factory**: Replace tile with your factory counter; discard tile.  
    - **Mine**: Replace tile with your mine counter; discard tile.  
    - **Windfall**: Take £3 from bank; discard tile.  
    - **Draw Two Cards**: Draw 2 cards; discard tile. (Hand limit: 9)  
    - **Big Game**: Keep tile; worth **1 VP** at game end.  
    - **Crisis**: Keep tile; worth **1 VP** at game end.  
    - **Tension**: Target another player’s mine or factory on that planet.  
      - Defense value = sum of defender’s units on planet and in orbit:  
        - Infantry/Spaceship: 1 each  
        - Tanks: 2 each  
      - Roll 3 dice: keep highest and lowest (discard middle); skull = 0.  
      - Combat Point (CP) cost = difference + defense value  
      - Pay CP using:  
        - Units moved to surface: Infantry/Spaceship = 1 CP, Tank = 2 CP  
        - Game cards with CP or modifiers  
      - At least **one unit must move** to surface.  
      - If successful: replace target with your counter; discard Tension tile.

  - **Defended tiles** (have defense value):  
    - Same CP cost calculation as Tension.  
    - Must pay CP cost using units and/or cards.  
    - At least one unit must move to surface.  
    - If cost not met: attempt fails, turn ends. Still suffer casualties.

- **Buy Military Units**  
  - Buy 1 or 2 units:  
    - Infantry: £2 each → place in orbit around **Earth only**  
    - Tanks: £3 each → place in orbit around any planet with **at least 1 of your factories**, or Earth (always allowed)  
    - Spaceships: £4 each → same placement as tanks  
  - Units can be placed on different planets.  
  - Limited by physical counter availability.

- **Perform Action On One Card**  
  - Play and discard a card marked "Action".

- **Take One Pass Cube**  
  - Take 1 Pass cube and draw 1 card.  
  - If you take the **last cube**, also take the **First Player marker**.  
  - Player Actions phase ends immediately.

**Card Types:**
- **Free Action**: Can be played at any time during your turn.
- **Benefit**: Played in conjunction with an action; multiple allowed per turn.

#### Phase 4 – Crisis Resolution  
1. Roll 3 dice; keep any showing skull symbols.  
2. From **Mercury to Kuiper Belt**, place one retained die on each **Crisis tile** marked with a skull.  
   - Repeat if dice remain (start again from Mercury).  
3. **Crisis Level** = number of Crisis tiles + dice on a planet.  
4. Resolve crises in order from **Mercury to Kuiper Belt**:

- **Mercury – Bazagthoth the Blinded**  
  - Only the player with **highest income on Mercury** gains power (tie: no one).  
  - Level 1: Pay £1 to randomly take 1 card from any player.  
  - Level 2: Pay £1 to destroy 1 military unit on any planet.  
  - Level 3+: Pay £3 to destroy 1 mine/factory on any planet.

- **Venus – Venusian Uprising**  
  - Level 1: No effect.  
  - Level 2–3: All players lose 2 military units from Venus. For each unit they can’t lose, lose 1 mine/factory (player’s choice).  
  - Level 4+: Remove all units, mines, factories from Venus. Discard all tiles. Flip Venus. No surface activity allowed. Units may orbit.

- **Earth – Robot Rebellion**  
  - Level 1: No effect.  
  - Level 2: Player with highest Earth income loses 1 mine/factory (choice). Tie: all tied players lose.  
  - Level 3: Same, but lose **2** pieces.  
  - Level 4+: **Game ends immediately. All players lose.**

- **Moon – Attack of the Moon Men**  
  - Level 1–3: No effect.  
  - Level 4+: Remove all units, mines, factories from Moon. Discard tiles. Flip Moon.  
    - Roll 3 dice; total = damage to Earth.  
    - In player order, players remove 1 unit each (military first, then mine/factory if no military).  
    - Continue until total removed = dice sum.  
    - No surface activity on Moon; orbit allowed.

- **Mars – Martian Invasion**  
  - Level 1: No effect.  
  - Level 2–3: Player with highest Mars income loses 1 mine/factory (choice). Tie: all tied players lose.  
  - Level 4+: Remove all units, mines, factories from Mars. Discard tiles. Flip Mars.  
    - Roll 3 dice; damage to Earth resolved same as Moon crisis.

- **Ganymede – Nothing Happens**  
  - No crisis effects ever.

- **Titan – Space Pirates!**  
  - Level 1: No effect.  
  - Level 2: Players with mines/factories on Titan pay £1 per piece to bank. If cannot pay, remove piece.  
  - Level 3+: Same, but includes **Ganymede and Kuiper Belt**.

- **Kuiper Belt – Alien Invasion**  
  - Level 1–2: No effect.  
  - Level 3+:  
    - Place first 3 Alien tiles on Kuiper Belt, Titan, Ganymede.  
    - Remove all units, mines, factories (including orbit) from these planets.  
    - No tiles placed on planets with Alien tiles.  
    - Next turn: surviving Alien tiles continue inward (Mars → Moon → Earth).  
    - Aliens **do not re-invade** retaken planets.  
    - **If aliens reach Earth: game ends, all players lose.**  
    - Players may attack Alien tiles like defended tiles (Defense Value = 7).  
    - Success: remove Alien tile, keep it → worth **2 VPs** at end.  
    - Aliens never return to cleared planets.

#### Phase 5 – Collect Income  
All players collect:  
- £3 per **mine**  
- £2 per **factory**  
(From all planets, including flipped/inactive ones if still present.)

#### Phase 6 – Reset Military Units  
Move all units on planet surfaces back into orbit around their respective planets.

Then begin next period.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Combat Point (CP) Cost Calculation**:  
  - Roll 3 dice → keep highest and lowest (discard middle) → difference + tile/defender defense value  
  - Skull = 0  
- **Unit Combat Values**:  
  - Infantry/Spaceship: 1 CP when moved to surface  
  - Tank: 2 CP when moved to surface  
- **Casualties**:  
  - After combat, lose **1 unit per skull rolled** (including discarded middle die, unless ignored by card).  
  - Applies even if combat failed or no combat occurred (if dice were rolled).  
  - Units lost from combat location.
- **Hand Limit**: 9 cards. Discard down if exceeded. Reshuffle discard pile when draw deck is empty.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends after **3 periods**.

**Victory Points (VPs):**

1. **Per Planet Control (based on income from mines/factories on that planet):**  
   - Each planet awards VPs for 1st, 2nd, and sometimes 3rd place as shown in hexagons.  
   - **Ties**: All tied players score the higher VP value.  
     - Example: Two players tie for 1st → both get 1st-place VPs; next player gets 2nd.

2. **Tile Bonuses:**  
   - **Big Game tile**: 1 VP each  
   - **Crisis tile**: 1 VP each  
   - **Alien tile** (destroyed by player): 2 VPs each  

**Total VPs = Planet VPs + Tile VPs**

**Winning:**  
- Player with most VPs wins.  
- Tiebreakers in order:  
  1. Player with **First Player marker**  
  2. Player with most **mines and factories on board**  
  3. Player with most **VPs from Big Game, Crisis, and Alien tiles**  
  4. If still tied, **players share the win**

**Special Loss Conditions:**  
- **Robot Rebellion Level 4+** or **Aliens reach Earth** → game ends immediately, **all players lose**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can tanks move?** Only if a card explicitly allows it.  
- **Can I claim a tile without moving?** Yes, if you take an action that allows claiming (e.g., after partial movement, or by spending a full action to claim).  
- **Do flipped planets (Venus, Moon, Mars) still generate income?** Yes, if you still have mines/factories there.  
- **Can I attack a planet with an Alien tile?** Yes, same as defended tile (Defense Value = 7). Success removes tile and gives 2 VPs.  
- **Can I build on a flipped planet?** No. No surface activity allowed. Factories/mines already there still produce income.  
- **What happens to Crisis tiles on Ganymede?** They are removed at the start of Phase 2.  
- **Do Alien tiles count for Crisis Level?** No. Only Crisis tiles and dice.  
- **Can I play multiple Benefit cards in one action?** Yes.  
- **Can I play a Free Action card during another player’s turn?** No. Only during your own turn.
