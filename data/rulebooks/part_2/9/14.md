## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Basari: Das Kartenspiel*, players take on the role of merchants competing in a vibrant gemstone marketplace. The goal is to earn the most victory points over three rounds by strategically collecting gemstones, scoring points during turns, and earning bonus points at the end of each round. Victory is determined by total points, with tiebreakers based on gemstone quantity and value.

### 2. Components  
- Game board featuring archway paths, colored carpets, a points track, and bonus point indicators  
- 100 gemstones (25 each of four colors: red, yellow, green, blue)  
- Four color-coded player sets, each containing:  
  - 1 Merchant Piece  
  - 1 Start Disk  
  - 1 Points Marker  
  - 1 Die  
  - 3 Action Cards: Gemstones, Points, Die  
- Rulebook

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center of the table.  
2. Place 25 gemstones of each color on their matching colored carpets on the board.  
3. Each player takes 3 gemstones of each color (12 total) from the carpets. These must remain visible to all players.  
4. Each player selects a color and takes the corresponding set of playing pieces.  
5. Place the **Points Marker** on the START arrow of the Points Track.  
6. Place the **Start Disk** in any archway on the board (multiple disks may occupy the same space).  
7. Place the **Merchant Piece** on top of the Start Disk.  
8. Each player keeps their three Action Cards for use throughout the game.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game consists of **three rounds**. Each turn has two phases:  

#### 1. Movement Phase  
- All players **simultaneously roll their dice**.  
- Move your Merchant Piece **clockwise** the number of archway spaces shown on your die.  
- The Start Disk remains in place to mark your starting position.  
- If your Merchant Piece **lands on or passes** your Start Disk during this movement, the **round ends after the Action Phase**.  

#### 2. Action Phase  
- All players **simultaneously select one of their three Action Cards** and place it face down.  
- Reveal all cards simultaneously. Resolve actions based on how many players chose each card:  

| Number of Players Choosing Same Card | Outcome |
|--------------------------------------|-------|
| 1 | The player performs the action. |
| 2 | The two players **barter** to determine who performs the action. |
| 3 or 4 | The action is **cancelled** for all who played it. |

##### Action Card Effects  
- **Gemstones Card**: Take gemstones shown in your current archway from the board’s carpets. If insufficient, take what’s available.  
- **Points Card**: Move your Points Marker forward on the Points Track by the number shown in your archway.  
- **Die Card**:  
  1. Roll your die.  
  2. Move your Merchant Piece forward by the number rolled.  
  3. Move your Points Marker forward by (6 – die roll).  
  - *Note:* If this movement causes your Merchant Piece to land on or pass your Start Disk, the round ends after this phase.

##### Bartering Rules (when exactly two players choose the same card)  
1. The player with **more points** on the Points Track (Player A) makes the first offer.  
   - If tied, roll the die to decide who starts.  
   - If Player A has no gemstones or declines to offer, they forfeit the action to Player B.  
2. Player B may:  
   - **Accept** the offer: receives the gemstones, Player A performs the action.  
   - **Reject and raise** the offer (see below).  
3. Players alternate offers until one accepts. The player whose offer is accepted performs the action and pays the agreed gemstones.

###### Raising the Offer  
An offer is raised by:  
- Offering **more total gemstones**, or  
- Offering the **same number but higher value**.  

Gemstone value order (highest to lowest): **Red > Yellow > Green > Blue**  
- Compare red first; if equal, compare yellow, etc.  
- Example: 1 red + 2 blue > 3 green (same count, but red is highest).  
- Players may retract and re-offer any combination they own.  
- Only gemstones currently held may be offered.

**Note (4-player games):** If multiple bartering pairs exist, resolve in this order: **Die Cards → Points Cards → Gemstones Cards**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Simultaneous Action Selection**: Players choose actions secretly each turn, leading to strategic bluffing and prediction.  
- **Movement Determined by Dice**: Random movement affects which actions are most beneficial.  
- **Bartering System**: Direct negotiation with structured rules ensures fair and engaging trades.  
- **Lap Completion Triggers Round End**: The first player to pass their Start Disk (after Action Phase) ends the round.  
- **Bonus Point Cycles**: Players must balance gem accumulation with returning gems to the board.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Bonus Points (awarded at end of each round)  
A round ends when **any player’s Merchant Piece lands on or passes their Start Disk** during Movement or Die Card action.

1. **Color Majority Bonuses**:  
   - For **each color**, the player with the **most gemstones** of that color scores the points listed on the Bonus Points Chart (printed on board and in rules).  
   - If tied, players **split points equally**, rounding down.  
   - The player(s) with the most must **return gemstones** to the board:  
     - **Solo winner**: returns **3** of that color.  
     - **Tie**: each tied player returns **2** of that color.  
     - If unable to return full amount, return as many as possible.  
   - Remaining gemstones are kept for the next round.

2. **Lap Bonus**:  
   - Any player whose Merchant Piece has completed a full lap (passed or landed on their Start Disk) earns **10 bonus points**.

3. **Reset for Next Round**:  
   - Move each player’s **Start Disk** to the archway currently occupied by their Merchant Piece.  
   - Merchant Pieces stay in place.  
   - Begin next round.

#### Final Scoring  
- After **three rounds**, the game ends.  
- The player with the **most total points** wins.

#### Tiebreaker  
1. Most total gemstones.  
2. Most valuable gemstones, compared by color in order: **Red → Yellow → Green → Blue**.  
   - Example: Equal red? Compare yellow. And so on.  
   - Example: Player A (6 red, 2 yellow) beats Player B (6 red, 2 green) because yellow > green.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can multiple players occupy the same space?**  
  Yes. Movement and actions are unaffected by other players’ positions.

- **What if I roll a 6 on the Die Card?**  
  Move Merchant 6 spaces, Points Marker moves 0 (6–6=0).

- **What if I roll a 1 on the Die Card?**  
  Move Merchant 1 space, Points Marker moves 5 spaces (6–1=5).

- **Can I barter gemstones I don’t have?**  
  No. Only gemstones in your possession may be offered.

- **Do I lose all my gemstones between rounds?**  
  No. You keep all gemstones except those returned during bonus point resolution.

- **Can a Die Card action trigger the end of the round?**  
  Yes. If the additional movement causes your Merchant to land on or pass your Start Disk, the round ends after the Action Phase.

- **Are Bonus Points awarded immediately?**  
  Yes. Move Points Markers during bonus phase. If exceeding 80, continue around the track.
