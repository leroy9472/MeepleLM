# Bella Rosarum v2 – Introductory Rules Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Bella Rosarum v2 is a historically revised version of the classic board game *Kingmaker*, simulating the Wars of the Roses (1455–1485) between the rival Houses of Lancaster and York. The game corrects geographical and historical inaccuracies while preserving and improving playability.

**Objective**: Achieve victory by being the sole player to control the last remaining crowned king or queen of England. Alternatively, hold control of the sole crowned monarch (excluding Henry VI) for four consecutive turns.

### 3. Setup
1. **Shuffle Crown Deck**: Remove 77 cards from the 100-card deck and deal equally among players (36 cards total; 35 if 5 players).
2. **Place Royal Counters**:
   - **Lancastrian**:
     - King Henry VI: The Tower of London
     - Margaret of Anjou: Kenilworth
     - Edward, Prince of Wales: Kenilworth
   - **Yorkist**:
     - Richard, Duke of York: Ludlow
     - Edward, Earl of March: Denbigh
     - Edmund, Earl of Rutland: Sandal
     - George, Duke of Clarence: Trim
     - Richard, Duke of Gloucester: Calais
3. **Faction Declaration**:
   - Players reveal all dealt cards.
   - Unused offices and earldoms go to the Chancery.
   - First player determined by order of precedence:
     1. Archbishop of Canterbury  
     2. Chancellor of England  
     3. Archbishop of York  
     4. Treasurer of England  
     7. Constable of England  
     9. Admiral of England  
     (Ties broken by coin flip)
4. **Optional Rule**: No combat on first turn (recommended for new players).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each player’s turn follows this sequence:
1. **Event Phase**: Draw top card from Event deck; all players follow instructions.
2. **Movement Phase**: Move nobles (up to 5 spaces, including diagonally), ships (up to 5 sea spaces), or combine land/sea transport.
3. **Combat Phase**: Resolve battles or sieges.
4. **Parliament Phase**: Sole crowned king may summon Parliament. If none, Chancellor (or Treasurer if allowed by card) may do so with a Writ card.
5. **Coronation Phase**: Crown eligible royal heir if conditions met.
6. **Crown Deck Phase**: Draw one card; play immediately or keep hidden.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Movement & Access
- **Road Movement**: Unlimited along roads if no unfriendly or unowned blocking cities/castles. Neutral or unowned cities (e.g., Oxford, Hereford) block roads unless bypassed via Influence.
- **Influence to Access Neutral Castles**:
  - Major cities: 30 Influence
  - Fortresses: 20
  - Cities: 15
  - Noble castles: 10
  - Allows temporary access to acquire royalty; does not confer ownership.
  - For unfriendly but unoccupied castles: double required Influence.
- **Open Cities**: Require 0 Influence to pass (e.g., Hereford, Oxford). Permanent ownership requires successful siege.
- **Kyngeston**: Requires 15 Influence to access; full ownership only via siege.

#### Crown Deck & Card Activation
- **Inherent Troops**: Nobles and constable-controlled cities provide constant troops.
- **Activated Troops**: Office and cleric cards require noble to end movement in specified area (e.g., Lieutenant of Ireland in Ulster/Pale). Rotate card 180° when activated.
- **Deactivation**: After battle or noble leaves area, return card to normal orientation.
- **Mercenaries**: Always available; not consumed. Removed only if peace made with foreign power via Embassy card.
- **Card Return on Death**:
  - Offices, earldoms, archbishoprics → Chancery
  - All other cards and nobles → Crown Deck discard pile

#### Combat
- **Battle**:
  - Attacker declares target and attacking nobles.
  - Compute troop ratio.
  - Draw Event card; compare ratio to printed threshold.
  - **Victory (R or V result)**: Eliminate all defenders.
  - **Defeat/Inconclusive**: No elimination.
  - **Noble Death**:
    - One attacking noble dies if "+" before result.
    - One defending noble dies if "+" after result.
- **Siege**:
  - Attacker must match or exceed garrison + any defending troops.
  - Draw Event card; ignore ratio.
  - **Success (not Bad Weather)**: Capture location and all inside.
  - **Bad Weather**: Location "under siege"; defenders may sally forth.
- **Ambush**: Not used in Introductory Rules (per A.2.c.2).

#### Parliament
- **Calling Parliament**:
  - Sole crowned king may call.
  - If no sole king, Chancellor (or Treasurer via Royal Summons card) may call with a Writ card.
- **Voting**:
  - Influence = sum of Influence values (bottom left of cards) of attending faction members.
  - "W" or "N" labels treated same as numeric value.
  - Nobles must be present to vote in Lords; Commons votes counted regardless.
- **Chancery Redistribution**:
  - Draw one card per attending noble.
  - Distribute to eligible nobles (even from other factions).
  - Titles/offices require Commons + Lords approval.
  - Bishoprics require Lords approval only.

#### Alliances
- Not detailed in Introductory Rules; optional.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Conditions**:
  1. Control the sole remaining crowned king or queen.
     - If last Lancastrian heir, player wins regardless of Beaufort.
     - If last Yorkist heir, player wins only if Beaufort is out of play.
  2. Control the sole crowned king (not Henry VI) for four consecutive turns.
- **Succession**:
  - Yorkist: Richard → Edward → Edmund → George → Richard of Gloucester
  - Lancastrian: Henry → Margaret → Edward → Beaufort → Tudor (if Beaufort out)
- **Chancery Risk**: If all clerics are in Chancery, no coronation possible, blocking Parliament.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use Influence to access a castle if I already hold enemy royalty?**  
  No. A royal in one faction will not open to a stack from the other faction if that stack already holds opposing royalty.
- **What happens when a noble dies?**  
  Offices, earldoms, archbishoprics → Chancery. All other cards and the noble → Crown Deck discard pile.
- **Can I reboard a ship after being ejected in a neutral port?**  
  No. Passengers disembark in the open; cannot reboard without friendly port or successful siege.
- **Do open cities have garrisons?**  
  Yes, 150 if besieged for ownership; otherwise, garrison is irrelevant for passage.
- **Can I declare Crown cards after attack is announced?**  
  Yes. Defender may declare cards after attack is announced but before Event card is drawn. Attacker may then respond. Combat is optional until card is drawn.
