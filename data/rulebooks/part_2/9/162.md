## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The crew of the Znutar must escape the ship infested with Awful Green Things (or alternative monster types: Obnoxious Orange Things or Insidious Purple Things). The objective is to survive by eliminating all monsters or escaping via shuttle. After escape, an epilogue determines the crew’s survival and final score. The Monster player aims to eliminate all crew members.

2. Components  
- Znutar ship board with interconnected areas (Cargo Hold, Science Lab, Bays, etc.)  
- Crew members: Captain, First Officer, Engineer, Pilot, Doc, Medic, Robot, Mascot, and others  
- Monster types:  
  - Awful Green Things: 12 Adults, 18 Babies, 19 Eggs, 22 Fragments  
  - Obnoxious Orange Things: 24 Fragments, 20 Young, 16 Adults  
  - Insidious Purple Things: 17 Eggs, 28 Young, 15 Adults  
- 29 weapon tokens (e.g., Stun Pistol, Rocket Fuel, Gas Grenade, Bottle of Acid, Fire Extinguisher, etc.)  
- Weapon effect chits (15 total, randomized)  
- Dice (d6, d10)  
- Counters for stunned units, airlock status, damage, supplies, etc. (implied)  

3. Setup  
- One player controls the Crew, the other the Monsters.

    - Place 1 Jet Suit in Cargo Hold, 1 in each Boat Bay.  
    - Place 1 Oak Suit in DC Central.  
  - Place crew in valid starting locations (specific locations not detailed, but must be valid).  
- Monster Phase:  
  - Choose monster type: AG (Awful Green), OO (Obnoxious Orange), or IP (Insidious Purple).  
  - Sort monsters by type.  
  - Determine starting population:  
    - AG: Roll d6; use corresponding egg/baby/adult counts.  
    - OO: Start with 6 fragments, 5 young, 4 adults.  
    - IP: Roll d6; use corresponding egg/young/adult counts.  
  - Place first monster:  
    - AG/IP: Roll d6 to determine placement (1–5: specific bays; 6: player choice).  
    - OO: Place 6 fragments in Mess Deck.  
  - Daisy-chain remaining monsters: 1 per adjacent area (connected by passage/hatch/airlock), avoiding crew areas.  
- Crew Discovery: Move 1–2 crew members (within movement allowance) into monster areas; they may attack hand-to-hand.  
- Monster takes the first turn.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Turns alternate: Monster → Crew → Monster → Crew...  
- Each turn has four phases:

**Monster Turn**  
1. Grow:  
   - Choose one non-stunned monster type to grow:  
     - Fragments → AG: Baby / OO: Young  
     - Eggs → Baby (AG/IP)  
     - Babies/Young → Adult  
     - Adults → Lay 1 egg (AG) / 1d die fragment (OO)  
   - Component-limited: if insufficient chits, player chooses which grow.  
   - OtZ: Monsters in space do not grow (optional).  
2. Move:  
   - Each non-stunned monster moves up to its movement allowance.  
   - Must stop upon entering area with non-stunned crew or electric fence.  
   - Can move out of such area if already in it.  
   - IP: Adults can phase through walls into most rooms (excludes Aft Machine Shop, Science Lab, Sick Bay, Hospital Ward, closed boats, space).  
   - OtZ: Monsters can use airlocks (whole turn required) at: Main Cargo Hold, Atmosphere Probe Launch, Boat Bays, Engine Room, Sensors, unoccupied boat in space. Crew in area can override to block.  
3. Attack:  
   - Each non-stunned monster attacks one crew member in its area.  
   - If Robot is present, all must attack it.  
   - Combine attack dice if multiple monsters attack same target.  
   - If total ≥ crew member’s Constitution, crew member dies and is removed. One monster eats it.  
     - If Robot dies: draw and apply a random weapon effect, return to bag.  
       - IP: Adult monster splits into 1d3 + 1 young.  
     - Otherwise: monster grows (per Grow phase).  
   - If total < Constitution, no effect.  
   - OtZ: Destroying occupied Cargo Mover/Jet Suit applies excess damage to occupant; Oak Suit or Mascot dies if destroyed.  
   - Cannot attack unoccupied Oak Suit.

- Escape: Crew enters boat with no hull monsters → launch → Epilogue.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when:  
  - All monsters eliminated, or  
  - All crew eliminated, or  
  - Crew escapes and Epilogue concludes.  
- If playing for points:  
  - Green Things score 111 VPs if crew evacuates.  
  - If Znutar self-destructs: 55.5 VPs.  
  - Crew VPs: sum of surviving members’ Constitutions (excluding Robot and Mascot) after Epilogue.  
- Epilogue outcomes determine survival and final path.
