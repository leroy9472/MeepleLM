### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game alternates between **Stock Rounds (SR)** and **Operating Rounds (OR)** as indicated on the Game Process Track.

#### Stock Round (SR)  
- Turn order: determined by previous round (initially by least cash).  
- On a turn, a player may:  
  1. Sell any number of shares (not Director’s Certificate) to Bank.  
  2. Buy one certificate from Bank at current price.  
- Cannot rebuy shares of a company just sold in the same SR.  
- Selling moves stock price left diagonally; buying has no immediate effect.  
- If all shares of a company are owned by players, price moves right diagonally.  
- Ends when all players pass consecutively.  
- Next SR order: most cash to least.  

#### Operating Round (OR)  
1. **Local Railways pay income** to owners (5K, 10K, 20K by size).  
2. Companies act in **descending stock price order** (highest first; ties broken by marker position).  
   Each company’s turn consists of:  
   a. **Lay Track (optional)**  
   - First turn: may lay two yellow tiles or upgrade one.  
   - Subsequent turns: one tile or upgrade.  
   - Must connect to own station unless laying home tile.  
   - Terrain costs apply on first lay.  
   b. **Place Station (optional)**  
   - First station (home base) is free and mandatory on first OR.  
   - Additional stations: first costs 40K, each after costs 100K.  
   - Must connect via track to existing station.  
   c. **Run Trains (mandatory)**  
   - Must run all trains it owns.  
   - Each train runs one route: connected revenue locations (cities, towns, red tiles).  
   - Route must include one of the company’s stations.  
   - No repeated revenue locations or track segments.  
   d. **Acquire Smaller Companies (optional)**  
   - Offer price between 50%–150% of target’s current stock price.  
   - Pay from acquiring company’s treasury to shareholders.  
   - Acquirer gains treasury, unplaced tokens, Local Railways.  
   - Replace tokens on map; scrapping or upgrading trains optional (pay difference).  
   e. **Buy Trains (optional, unless required)**  
   - Must end turn owning a train it can operate.  
   - Buy from Bank or other companies (after first b-train sold).  
   - Trains bought in order; phase changes may trigger.  
   f. **Local Railway Actions (anytime during turn)**  
   - Buy from players (1K to current Local Railway price).  
   - Sell to Bank for current price.  
   - Use special power: lay purple tile or ignore terrain cost (once per power, flip card).  

- **End of OR:**  
  - If dividend paid (>0K), stock price moves right (1 space for S/M, 2 for L).  
  - If no dividend, price moves left 1 space.  
  - Move Local Railways price up 1 space (starts at 40K).  
  - If it reaches 120K, this was the final OR.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Train Types  
- **Small (X):** Runs through up to X revenue locations. Cannot skip towns.  
- **Medium (X+X):** Runs through up to 2X locations, but no more than X cities/red tiles.  
- **Large (XE):** Runs through up to X locations, may skip any number of towns.  

#### Company Sizes  
- **Small (S):** Runs small trains. 3 stations. Max 75% owned by one player.  
- **Medium (M):** Runs medium trains. 3 stations. Max 60% owned.  
- **Large (L):** Runs large trains. 2 stations. Max 60% (70% in Moravia-Silesia).  

#### Phase Changes  
Triggered by purchase or export of first train of a new type:  

| Phase | Trigger | Effects |
|-------|-------|--------|
| a | Start | Yellow tiles; train limit 3 |
| b | First b-train | Buy trains from companies; buy Local Railways; M shares available |
| c | First c-train | None |
| d | First d-train | Green tiles; L shares available; red tile value 2 |
| e | First e-train | Scrap 2-trains if 4-train bought; S train limit → 2 |
| f | First f-train | Scrap 2+2 if 4+4 bought; M train limit → 2 |
| g | First g-train | Brown tiles; red tile value 3; scrap 3-trains if 5-train bought |
| h | First h-train | Scrap 3+3 if 5+5 bought; S train limit → 1 |
| i | First i-train | Grey tiles; red tile value 4; scrap 3E if 6E bought; M train limit → 1 |
| j | First j-train | Scrap 4E if 8E bought; L train limit → 2 |

#### Emergency Financing  
- If company lacks funds to buy required train:  
  - Director pays shortfall from personal cash.  
  - If insufficient, takes loan from Bank (penalty: 100% of loan subtracted at game end).  
  - Cannot buy shares while in debt.  

#### Directorship Change  
- Occurs when:  
  - Player becomes strict majority owner.  
  - Current director sells down to minority (another player owns ≥ director’s share).  
- Tie: player earlier in SR order takes control.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when Local Railways price reaches 120K (after that OR).  
- Final wealth = cash + value of shares (current price) + value of Local Railways (120K each).  
- Subtract any unpaid loans and penalty interest (100% of loan amount).  
- Highest total wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a company run a train with no route?**  
  Yes, but must still own a runnable train. Income is 0K.  
- **Can you buy a train from another company before b-train?**  
  No. Only after first b-train is sold.  
- **What happens when a company acquires another?**  
  Acquirer pays shareholders, gains assets, replaces tokens, may upgrade/scrapp trains.  
- **Can Local Railways be sold during SR?**  
  No. Only during OR by company to Bank.  
- **Do red tiles count as cities?**  
  Yes, for train route limits.  
- **Can two companies share a station hex?**  
  Yes, but if both have tokens, one must be removed after acquisition.
