## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Power Grid: The Card Game*, players are CEOs of power companies competing to build the most efficient energy empire. The goal is to acquire powerful Power Plants, fuel them with resources, and generate electricity. Victory is determined at the end of the game by combining Victory Points (VP) from Power Plants and leftover money. The player with the highest total wins.

### 2. Components  
- CEO Cards (6 pairs, in 6 colors)  
- Double Left/Right Arrow Cards (turn order indicators)  
- Power Plant Cards:  
  - 13 Small Power Plants (dark green back)  
  - 29 Large Power Plants (light green back)  
  - "One More Round" card  
- Money (Elektro): Denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50  
- Resource Cards:  
  - 36 Normal Resource Cards (Coal, Gas, Oil, Uranium)  
  - 4 Single Resource Cards (surplus, 1 Elektro each)  
  - 4 "+" Resource Cards (reshuffle markers)  
  - 4 "++" Resource Cards (second reshuffle markers)  
- Resource Price Cards (1–4 Elektro)  
- Discount Marker (wooden #1)  
- Demolition Contractor Cards (6 cards, variant only)

### 3. Setup  
**Turn Order:**  
- Each player selects a color and places one CEO card in front of them.  
- Shuffle the second CEO cards and lay them face-up in a row—this determines initial turn order (leftmost = First Player).  
- Place Double Right Arrow to the left and Double Left Arrow to the right of the row to indicate turn direction.  

**2-Player Game ("The Trust"):**  
- "The Trust" acts as a third player with its own CEO cards.  
- Place "The Trust’s" second CEO card second in the turn order.  
- "The Trust" always plays second; only human players swap positions if turn order changes.  

**Money:**  
- Each player receives 12 Elektro.  
- "The Trust" has no money.  

**Power Plant Market:**  
- Shuffle 13 Small Power Plant Cards. Draw 8, flip face-up, sort by number ascending.  
- Place 4 lowest-numbered in the **Current Market** (top row).  
- Place 4 highest-numbered in the **Future Market** (bottom row).  
- Newer cards of same number go to the right.  
- Place Discount Marker on the lowest-numbered Power Plant in Current Market.  

**Power Plant Stack:**  
- Set aside "One More Round" card and 1 Small Power Plant (face down).  
- Remove from Large Plant deck:  
  - 2P: 9 cards  
  - 3P: 6 cards  
  - 4P: 3 cards  
  - 5P: 1 card  
  - 6P: 0 cards  
- Remove from Small Plant stack:  
  - 2P: 4 cards  
  - 3P: 3 cards  
  - 4P: 2 cards  
  - 5P: 1 card  
  - 6P: 0 cards  
- Shuffle remaining Small and Large Plants together.  
- Place set-aside Small Plant on top, "One More Round" card on bottom.  

**Resource Market:**  
- Place Resource Price Cards (1–4 Elektro) in a row.  
- Use only Normal Resource Cards matching player count (check bottom-right corner).  
- Shuffle used Resource Cards.  
- Fill columns 2, 3, and 4 with Resource Cards based on player count:  
  - 2P: 3 cards per column  
  - 3P: 3 cards per column  
  - 4P: 4 cards per column  
  - 5P: 4 cards per column  
  - 6P: 5 cards per column  
- Place cards with highest number face-up.  
- Column 1 (1 Elektro) remains empty—holds Single Resource Cards.  
- Arrange cards by type (Coal, Gas, Oil, Uranium), top to bottom.  
- Within type, sort by quantity (fewest at top).  
- Remaining Resource Cards form the Resource Stack (face down) below Single Resource Cards.  

**Discard Piles:**  
- Place 4 "+" Resource Cards face-up below Resource Stack (first discard pile).  
- Place 4 "++" Resource Cards below that (second discard pile, starts empty after first shuffle).  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has three phases:  
1. **Auction Power Plants** (First to Last Player)  
2. **Buy Resources** (Last to First Player)  
3. **Bureaucracy** (All players, then turn order reset)  

Final round skips Bureaucracy.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Phase 1: Auction Power Plants  
- Discount Marker reduces minimum bid of lowest-numbered Power Plant to 1 Elektro.  
- Players take turns in order. On turn, choose:  
  - **Auction a Plant**: Select any Power Plant from Current Market. Bid at least its number.  
    - Bidding proceeds clockwise. Players may bid higher or pass.  
    - Last bidder wins, pays bid to bank, takes plant.  
    - Replace with new plant from stack. Re-sort Current and Future Markets (4 lowest in Current, 4 highest in Future).  
    - New plant of same number goes to the right.  
  - **Pass**: Cannot bid or auction later this phase.  

**Rules:**  
- First round: All players **must** buy a Power Plant.  
- After buying, player cannot participate in further auctions.  
- If auction winner is current player, next player acts (if not bought).  
- If another player wins, current player may auction another plant.  
- Max 3 Power Plants per player. Buying a 4th requires scrapping one immediately.  
  - Scrapped plant is removed. Resources reallocated if possible; otherwise discarded.  
- Last player may buy any plant at minimum bid (no auction).  
- If Discount Marker active and new plant has lower number:  
  - Remove new plant from game.  
  - Remove Discount Marker.  
  - Draw replacement.  
- If lowest-numbered plant unsold at end of phase:  
  - Remove it from game.  
  - Replace from stack.  
- If "One More Round" card is drawn:  
  - Place it in Future Market as highest-numbered.  
  - At end of phase: Remove "One More Round" card and lowest-numbered Current Market plant.  
  - Shuffle remaining stack.  
  - Final round begins next (Market size 6).  

**2-Player Game – The Trust:**  
- Only human players auction.  
- After first player buys or passes, "The Trust" takes highest-numbered plant in Current Market (no cost).  
- If 4th plant acquired, discard leftmost.  
- Final round: "The Trust" takes highest from Future Market.  

**First Round Only – Turn Order Reset:**  
- After Auction Phase, re-determine turn order by Power Plant number (highest = First Player).  
- Tiebreakers:  
  - 2 players tied: swap positions.  
  - 3+ tied: first and third swap.  

#### Phase 2: Buy Resources  
- Play in reverse order (Last to First).  
- Players may buy any number of Resource Cards, paying market price.  
- Cannot exceed storage:  
  - Max storage = 2 × total resource cost of all Power Plants.  
  - Only store resources types that current plants can use.  
- If buying card with more resources than can store:  
  - Pay full cost.  
  - Reduce card to storage limit.  
  - Place surplus as Single Resource Cards in #1 column.  
- No limit on #1 column.  

**2-Player Game – The Trust:**  
- Takes resources for all plants (no cost).  
- Prioritizes:  
  1. Normal plants before hybrid.  
  2. Cheapest available (starts at #1, moves right).  
  3. For hybrid: prefers Gas over Oil if prices equal.  
- Returns surplus to #1 column.  
- Takes what’s available if insufficient.  

**Final Round Only:**  
- Cannot buy excess resources.  
- May only buy what is needed for final production.  
- Excess must go to #1 column.  
- If already have excess, cannot buy more.  

#### Phase 3: Bureaucracy  
**Skip entirely in final round.**

**Step 1: Produce Electricity, Income, Turn Order**  
- In CEO order, each player chooses which Power Plants to power.  
- Must have full required resources.  
- Receive Elektro income equal to plant’s income value.  
- Resources consumed: turn card to lower number.  
  - Reaches 0: discard (Normal) or return to pile (Single).  
- Players who produce nothing get 1 Elektro.  
- Income set aside (not spent until next round).  

**Determine Turn Order:**  
- Rank players by income (highest = First).  
- Tiebreakers:  
  1. Highest-numbered Power Plant.  
  2. Swap relative positions (2 tied), or first and third swap (3+ tied).  

**2-Player Game – The Trust:**  
- Discards resources but receives no income.  
- Remains in second position. Human players arrange around it.  

**Step 2: Resupply Resource Market**  
- Slide normal resources left (column 3→2, 4→3), filling gaps.  
- Order: by type (Coal→Gas→Oil→Uranium), then by quantity (fewest first).  
- Refill empty slots from Resource Stack:  
  - Start with #2, then #3, then #4.  
  - Within column: sort by type and quantity.  
- If stack empty:  
  - First time: reshuffle discard pile (including "+" cards), form new stack. Move "++" pile next to it.  
  - Second time: reshuffle discard (including "+" and "++"), new stack. Discard pile now starts empty.  
- **Each reshuffle triggers:**  
  - Remove lowest-numbered Current Market plant.  
  - Replace from stack. Re-sort market.  

**Step 3: Update Power Plant Market**  
- Move highest-numbered Future Market plant to bottom of stack (face down).  
- Draw new plant from stack to replace it. Re-sort market.  
- If "One More Round" card drawn:  
  - Remove it and lowest-numbered Current Market plant.  
  - Shuffle remaining stack.  
  - Final round begins (Market size 6).  
- If "One More Round" already in market (from Phase 1):  
  - Remove lowest-numbered Current Market plant.  
  - Replace from stack.  
  - Final round begins.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Final round has **6 Power Plants** (3 Current, 3 Future).  
- Final round skips **Bureaucracy**.  
- After Phase 2 (Buy Resources), proceed to scoring.  

**Scoring:**  
- Each player powers plants as in Bureaucracy.  
  - Each powered plant gives **1 VP per Elektro of income** (no actual money gained).  
  - Unpowered plants give 0 VP.  
- Convert money: **1 VP per 10 Elektro** (round down, keep remainder).  

**Total Score = VP from Plants + VP from Money**  

**Winning:**  
- Highest total VP wins.  
- Tiebreakers:  
  1. Most remaining Elektro.  
  2. Highest-numbered Power Plant.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use partial resources for partial income?**  
  No. Must fully power a plant or not at all.  

- **Can I store more than 2× resource cost?**  
  No. Storage limit is strict.  

- **What if I draw "One More Round" during Phase 3?**  
  Remove it and lowest Current Market plant. Final round begins.  

- **Can I scrap a plant outside of buying a 4th?**  
  No. Only when buying a 4th.  

- **Do I pay for resources I can’t store?**  
  Yes. Pay full price, store up to limit, excess to #1 column.  

- **Can Eco Plants store resources?**  
  No. They require none and cannot store any.  

- **Hybrid Plant storage?**  
  Total storage ≤ 2 × required number (e.g., needs 2, max 4 total of Gas/Oil in any mix).  

- **Reshuffling Resource Deck?**  
  Triggered only when drawing from empty stack. Each reshuffle removes lowest Current Market plant.
