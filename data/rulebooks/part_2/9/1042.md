## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Each player controls a team of four adventurers—two knights, one thief, and one wizard—competing to slay dragons and claim treasure. The primary objective is to amass the most points through treasure and gem dominance. While slaying dragons is straightforward, the real challenge lies in negotiating loot division when multiple players cooperate to defeat a dragon.

2. Components  
- 18 Dragon cards  
- 1 Market card  
- 24 Adventurer cards (4 per player in 6 colors: 2 knights, 1 thief, 1 wizard)  
- 24 Magic Object cards  
- 6 Treasure Screens & Scoring Summary Cards  
- 126 wooden Treasure tokens:  
  - 35 Silver (1 point)  
  - 20 Gold (3 points)  
  - 16 Red (Magic Items, 1 point)  
  - 48 Gem tokens: 12 each of Blue (Sapphire), Green (Emerald), Purple (Amethyst), Yellow (Amber), and White (Diamond)  
  - 1 Black Diamond (15 or 19 points, depending on rules)  
- Cloth bag for treasure tokens  
- 60-second sand timer  

3. Setup  
- Each player takes:  
  - One set of 4 Adventurer cards (same color), placed face up  
  - One Treasure Screen and Scoring Summary Card  
- Shuffle Dragon deck; place face down as draw pile.  
- Reveal top 4 Dragon cards in a row; place "Known Treasure" (bottom-left number) of random tokens on each.  
- Place Market card between the 7th and 8th cards in the Dragon draw pile.  
- Shuffle Magic Object deck; deal one card face down to each player (may look). Remaining deck placed near play area.  
- First player: Last person who killed a dragon; otherwise, choose randomly.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. On a turn, each player must send one face-up adventurer to attack one of the four face-up dragons.  
2. Place adventurer card face up under target dragon. Overlap to show attack values.  
3. After placement, sum attack values of all adventurers on that dragon.  
   - If total < Dragon’s strength (top center): dragon remains alive.  
   - If total ≥ Dragon’s strength: dragon is slain. Proceed to treasure division.  
4. When a dragon is slain:  
   a. Draw "Hidden Treasure" (bottom-right number) of random tokens from bag and place on dragon.  
   b. If only one player contributed: that player takes all treasure.  
   c. If multiple players: begin 60-second negotiation phase.  
5. Negotiation Rules:  
   - Only treasure on the slain dragon may be discussed.  
   - All tokens must be assigned to specific players.  
   - No random methods (dice, coin flips).  
   - No side deals or promises about future turns.  
   - If no agreement in 60 seconds: all treasure is removed from the game.  
6. After negotiation (successful or not):  
   a. Adventurers used in slaying are returned face down to their owners.  
   b. Dragon card is discarded.  
   c. Draw next dragon from pile; place with known treasure. If Market card appears, trigger Market phase.  
7. Market Phase (after 7th dragon is drawn):  
   - Players have 60 seconds to trade any treasure tokens.  
   - No Magic Object cards drawn.  
   - Players may reveal or hide their holdings.  
   - After time, Market card is removed. Game continues.  
8. Game ends when treasure bag is empty.  
   - No new dragons are drawn after this point.  
   - Players continue until all remaining dragons on table are slain.  
   - Final scoring occurs after last dragon is defeated.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Adventurer Resting: After returning from battle, adventurers are placed face down. At the start of a turn where a player has no face-up adventurers, all are flipped face up.  
- Skipping Turn: If all adventurers are face down and attacking, player cannot act.  
- Wizard Power:  
  - (Advanced Rule) If a wizard is involved and receives at least one red Magic Item token in negotiation, they draw one Magic Object card per red token.  
  - Magic Object cards are used once and discarded. Replenish deck from discard if needed.  
- Thief Power:  
  - After negotiation, each thief steals one random treasure token from each other player who helped slay the dragon.  
  - Thieves act in order they were played on the dragon.  
- Wizard + Thief Combo:  
  - If same player has both, they may choose (not random) which token to steal from each opponent.  
- Magic Object Cards:  
  - One dealt at start. May be used at any time during game. Discarded after use.  
  - "Invisible Hand" card (recommended to omit for balance) allows stealing.
