# Lost Valley — Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In spring 1850, prospectors set out from a trading post beneath a roaring waterfall to explore the uncharted Lost Valley in search of gold. The game captures the rugged adventure of the Gold Rush, where players balance exploration, resource gathering, and strategic building.

**Objective:** Be the player with the most gold nuggets (not markers) in your gold bag when the game ends.

The game ends immediately when either:
- A prospector reaches the waterfall trading post with 10 or more gold markers and announces game end, or
- The ice block reaches the waterfall trading post after a successful die roll.

## 2. Components
- 1 waterfall trading post tile
- 44 land tiles (diamond-shaped river and land tiles, triangle-shaped land tiles)
- 11 triangle-shaped landscape tiles (including spring, moonshine still, abandoned mine, etc.)
- 4 prospector pawns (one per player)
- 4 inventory sheets (one per player)
- 177 markers:
  - Gold: green rivergold, grey mountaingold
  - Events: yellow event markers
  - Animals: green animal markers
  - Special: dried fish, dynamite stick, whiskey bottle
- 90 square markers: food, timber, tools
- 20 wooden timber pieces
- 1 die (six-sided)
- 1 ice block token
- 1 overview sheet (with action icons, ware costs, building costs)
- Rulebook (in multiple languages)

## 3. Setup
1. **Place the trading post** at the edge of the play area.
2. **Shuffle tiles** into three face-down decks:
   - River-diamond tiles
   - Land-diamond tiles
   - Land-triangle tiles
3. **Place the spring triangle tile face-up** beside the supply.
4. **Place supply piles**:
   - Wares: axes, boats, carts, crates of dynamite, fishing rods, horses, rifles, sieves, whiskey
   - Materials: food, timber, tools
   - Works: fishtraps, mines, sawmills
   - Markers: rivergold, mountaingold, events, animals (shuffled and placed facedown)
5. **Give each player**:
   - A prospector pawn (place at trading post)
   - An inventory sheet
   - Starting gear: 2 whiskeys
   - Starting materials: 1 food, 1 timber, 3 tools
6. **Place the ice block** aside until triggered.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
On a player’s turn, perform the following in any order:
1. **Move/Explore**
2. **Perform One Action**
3. **Optional Trade**
4. **Ice Test (if ice block is in play)**

Players may skip any part of their turn.

### 1. Move/Explore
- Move along tile edges (not across tile faces).
- Only one prospector per intersection unless on a riverside (then two allowed).
- Movement modes:
  - **On foot**: 1 edge overland or up to 2 edges along a river.
  - **With horse**: up to 2 edges overland or along a river.
  - **With boat**: up to 3 edges along a river; may cross rivers.
- Cannot combine movement types in one move phase.
- If moving to an unexplored intersection, **explore**:
  - **River extension first**: if adjacent to unexplored river, draw and place river-diamond tiles to extend the river. Must route adjacent to prospector if possible.
  - If no valid river tile, discard and draw again. If none available, place the spring tile.
  - Then fill remaining gaps with land-diamond or land-triangle tiles as needed.
  - **Enclosed spaces**:
    - With river flowing out → place spring tile
    - Dry diamond → place land-diamond
    - Dry triangle → place land-triangle
  - Place markers on newly placed tiles:
    - Rivergold on green circles (on correct riverside)
    - Mountaingold on grey circles
    - Animal markers (facedown)
    - Event markers (on ? symbols)

### 2. Perform One Action
Choose **one** of the following actions. May be taken before or after movement, but not during.

**a. Mine Gold**
- **Rivergold (green)**: adjacent to river, lake, or tundra with canal. Discard 1 food to take 1 rivergold. With **sieve**, take 2.
- **Mountaingold (grey)**: adjacent mountain tile with a built mine. Discard 1 food + 1 timber to take 1. With **dynamite**, take 2. (Crate of dynamite = reusable; stick of dynamite = one use.)
- Cannot mine from opposite side of river without boat.

**b. Experience an Event**
- Discard any 2 materials (food, timber, tools).
- On regular tile: take top event marker.
- On triangle tile: look at all event markers and choose one.
- Effects:
  - Gold: place in gold bag
  - Wares: add to gear
  - Special wares: place in gear (one-time use):
    - **Dried fish**: discard anytime for 4 food
    - **Stick of dynamite**: discard when mining to take 2 mountaingold
    - **Whiskey**: discard anytime during turn for extra move or action

**c. Catch a Fish**
- Adjacent to river or lake.
- Base: 1 food if tile has fish symbol.
- +1 if you have fishing rod.
- +1 if you are on a fishtrap.
- Total: up to 3 food per turn.

**d. Hunt an Animal**
- Adjacent tile has animal marker.
- Roll d6 vs. opponent (who rolls for animal). Highest wins.
- If you win: remove animal, take food (1–4 based on animal).
- With **rifle**: +3 to your roll.
- At bear cave triangle: place new animal after each hunt.

**e. Cut Down a Tree**
- Adjacent forest tile.
- Base: 1 timber.
- +1 if you have axe.
- +1 if you are on a sawmill.
- Total: up to 3 timber.

**f. Build Works**
- Works are public; anyone can use them.
- Only one work per intersection.
- **Fishtrap**: at river/lake intersection, pay 1 tool.
- **Sawmill**: at forest intersection, pay 1 tool.
- **Canal**: connect forest/tundra to water or canal. Pay 1 timber. Cannot go through mountains. Must be adjacent to both tiles being connected.
- **Mine**: on mountain tile, pay 1 tool + 1 food + 1 timber.

**g. Purchase Wares**
- At waterfall trading post or adjacent to triangle trading post/moonshine still.
- Pay with gold nuggets (from gold bag).
- "X" in cost = pay with 1 nugget, 1 raw material, or 1 ware.
- May buy multiple items if affordable and in stock.
- No change given.
- Moonshine still: buy whiskey for 2 raw materials/wares instead of 1 nugget.

### 3. Optional Trade
- **With trading post**: as above.
- **With other players**: if on same intersection or one edge apart, may trade items. No cost, no action required. Only one trade per turn.

### 4. Ice Test (if ice block is in play)
- Roll d6. On 5–6, move ice block one river tile downstream.
- Game ends when ice block reaches waterfall.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Inventory Limits**:
  - Backpack: 6 spaces (food/tool = 1, timber = 2)
  - Cart: adds 4 spaces
  - Gear: 6 spaces (wares and special wares)
  - Carts, horses, boats, and timber may be placed vertically to fit.
  - Items need only fit at **end of turn**.
- **Whiskey Use**:
  - Discard 1 whiskey per turn for either:
    - Extra move phase, or
    - Extra action phase.
  - Can be used at any point during turn.
- **Tile Placement Rules**:
  - River must be extended first when possible.
  - Spring tile ends exploration and triggers ice block.
- **Gold Collection**:
  - Gold markers collected face-down in gold bag.
  - Value revealed only at endgame (1–4 nuggets per marker).
- **Movement Restrictions**:
  - Cannot combine river and overland movement in one move.
  - Horse cannot cross river without boat.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game ends** when:
  - Ice block reaches waterfall (after die roll), or
  - A player reaches waterfall with ≥10 gold markers and declares end.
- **Scoring**:
  - Reveal all gold markers.
  - Sum total **nuggets** (not markers).
- **Winner**: player with most nuggets.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Q: Can I use whiskey before my normal action?**  
  A: Yes. You may move → drink whiskey → move again → act, or act → drink → act again.

- **Q: Can I build a canal through a mountain?**  
  A: No.

- **Q: Can I mine rivergold from across the river?**  
  A: No. You must be on the same side.

- **Q: Do used markers return to supply?**  
  A: Square markers (food, tools, wood, whiskey) return to supply. Round markers (animals, special wares, gold) are removed from play until supply is exhausted, then reset.

- **Q: Can I have more than 6 gear spaces?**  
  A: No, but you may temporarily exceed limit during turn; must comply by end of turn.

- **Q: Can I use both crate and stick of dynamite?**  
  A: No. Only one source of dynamite per mining action.

- **Q: Can I move along the table edge?**  
  A: Yes. The bluff edge is treated as a continuous boundary.

- **Q: Does ice block prevent activity?**  
  A: No. It only acts as a timer.

- **Q: Can I build multiple works in one turn?**  
  A: Only if using whiskey for a second action.
