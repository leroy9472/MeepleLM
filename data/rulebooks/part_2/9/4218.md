## O Zoo le Mio – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *O Zoo le Mio*, players are zoo architects competing over five years to build the most attractive zoo. The goal is to attract the most visitors by creating the largest and most appealing animal enclosures. Victory is achieved by earning the most points through visitors, trees, and benches, scored annually and multiplied by the year number.

### 2. Components  
- Zoo entrance tiles (1 per player)  
- Starting frame tiles (1 per player)  
- Zoo tiles (25 total, 5 per year)  
- Coins (used as bidding currency)  
- Meeple tokens in player colors (representing visitors)  
- Tree tokens  
- Bench tokens  
- Flag tiles (1 per player)  
- Flag pole tile  
- Scoring block or tally sheet (tracks points per year)  
- Tally markers (6 per player, matching flag color)

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player takes:
   - A zoo entrance tile
   - The matching starting frame tile
   - 8 coins (placed hidden in the zoo entrance)
   - 6 tally markers in their color
2. Place the starting frame and zoo entrance in each player’s play area.
3. Place all remaining coins, meeple tokens (visitors), tree tokens, and benches in the center supply.
4. Shuffle the flag tiles and stack them randomly on the flag pole tile, determining initial tiebreak order.
5. Shuffle the 25 zoo tiles face down into a draw pile.
6. For the current year (round), draw 5 zoo tiles and reveal the first 3. Keep the final 2 face-down; reveal one at a time during the round.

### 4. Gameplay Flow (Per Year – 5 Rounds Total)  
Each year consists of 5 tile auctions and placements, followed by end-of-year income and scoring.

**Phase 1: Tile Auction**  
- Reveal the next zoo tile (initially, the first of 5).
- Players simultaneously bid using hidden coins from their supply.
- Highest bidder wins the tile and pays the coins to the supply.
- **Tiebreaker**: The player whose flag is highest on the flag pole wins. The winner of a tied auction moves their flag to the bottom of the pole.

**Phase 2: Tile Placement**  
- The winner places the tile in their zoo area.
- Placement rules:
  - At least half of one side must align and connect with half of an existing tile (like dominoes).
  - All path edges touching another tile must match (path to path, grass to grass).
  - No path may end in grass; all paths must lead to another tile or form a loop.
- After placement:
  - If the tile creates a **closed loop** of paths, the player takes a bench and places it in the center of the loop.
  - Update exhibit sizes for each animal color (see Core Mechanics).

**Phase 3: Repeat**  
- Reveal the next tile from the year’s set.
- Auction the **oldest unrevealed tile** (i.e., first-in, first-out order).
- Repeat auction and placement until all 5 tiles for the year are placed.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
**Animal Enclosures (by Color)**  
- Animal types (colors): Primates, Reptiles, Birds, Aquatic Animals, Large Mammals.
- Enclosures are formed by adjacent tiles of the same animal color (edge-to-edge, not diagonal).
- Adjacent tiles of the same color merge into a single exhibit.
- The **total number of stars** on tiles in an exhibit determines its attractiveness.
- Only the **largest exhibit per animal type** per player is tracked for scoring.

**Tally Trackers**  
- Each player has a tally marker for each animal type and trees.
- After each tile placement, update the size (star count) of the largest exhibit for each animal type.
- The tree tally increases by 1 for each tree in the player’s zoo.

**End-of-Year Actions**  
After all 5 tiles are placed:
1. **Visitor Allocation** (per animal type):
   - The player with the most stars in an animal type gains 2 visitors (meepees).
   - The second-most gains 1 visitor.
   - If only one player has an exhibit of that type, they gain 1 visitor.
   - **Tiebreaker**: Most recent tile placement breaks ties (newest attraction wins).
2. **Tree Allocation**:
   - The player with the most trees gains 2 tree tokens.
   - The second-most gains 1 tree.
   - **Tiebreaker**: Highest flag on the pole wins; flag does **not** move.
3. **Income**:
   - Each player receives 3 coins (standard rule).  
   *(Variant: 1 coin per zoo tile, or fixed income like 3 coins regardless.)*

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Annual Scoring (After Year 1 to Year 5)**  
- For each year N (from 1 to 5):
  - Count the total number of **visitors**, **trees**, and **benches** in your zoo.
  - Add them together.
  - Multiply the sum by the year number (N).
  - Record this score on the scoring block.
- Example: In Year 3, if you have 4 visitors, 2 trees, and 1 bench → (4+2+1)=7 → 7×3 = 21 points.

**Game End**  
- The game ends after Year 5.
- Total all points from all five years.
- The player with the highest total score wins.
- **Tiebreaker**: Not specified in source; house rule recommended (e.g., most visitors, then most trees).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a path end in grass?** No. All path edges must connect to another tile’s path or form a loop.
- **Do diagonal tiles combine enclosures?** No. Only orthogonally adjacent tiles of the same color combine.
- **What if no one has an exhibit of a certain animal type?** No visitors are awarded for that type.
- **When are the last two tiles revealed?** One is revealed after the third tile is placed, the last after the fourth.
- **Do benches count toward scoring immediately?** Yes. Benches are placed when a loop is formed and count in that year’s scoring.
- **Are coins scored?** No. Coins are only for bidding and have no point value.
