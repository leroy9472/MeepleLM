## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Prosperity is a strategic board game set across seven decades of technological development, from 1970 to 2030. Players represent nations striving to balance economic growth, energy production, ecological responsibility, and technological advancement. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the game through effective management of resources, pollution, research, and technology adoption.

### 2. Components  
- Research board (central board with score track, energy/ecology research tracks, and tile placement zones)  
- Technology tiles (grouped by decade: 1970–2030; each tile has an area, level, scoring symbol, and energy/ecology impact)  
- Player boards (one per player; two sides: silver/normal and black/difficult)  
- Player cubes (5 per player in a single color)  
- Pollution discs (black; 8 per player initially)  
- Banknotes (€ currency; starting with 100€ per player)  
- Score track (on Research board; one per player)

### 3. Setup  
1. **Technology Tiles**:  
   - Sort tiles by decade.  
   - Place undated tiles (no decade on back) face-up beside the Research board:  
     - Energy tiles (blue number in lower-left) on the left side.  
     - Ecology tiles (green number in lower-right) on the right side.  
   - Shuffle each decade’s tiles separately.  
   - Stack all decade decks into one pile: 2030 on bottom, 1970 on top.  

2. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player takes:  
     - One player board (choose silver/normal or black/difficult side).  
     - 1 × 100€ banknote.  
     - 5 cubes of one color.  
   - Place cubes as follows:  
     - 1 on the "0" space of the shared score track (Research board).  
     - 1 each on the red-marked spaces of the Energy and Ecology tracks on their player board.  
     - 8 pollution discs on the Pollution track (player board), starting from the bottom.  

3. **Board Setup**:  
   - Place Research board in center.  
   - Create a bank (money reserve) and extra pollution disc reserve.  
   - Choose starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise over a total of 36 turns (7 decades).  
- Each turn consists of two phases:  
  1. **Draw and Score Phase** (triggered by drawing a Technology tile).  
  2. **Action Phase** (active player takes 2 actions).  
- Game ends after the 36th turn (when last Technology tile is drawn).  

---

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### A. Draw and Score Phase  
- Active player draws the top Technology tile.  
- Reveals and announces the **scoring symbol** (white-bordered icon at bottom center).  
- All players, starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, score based on the announced symbol:  

| Symbol | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Energy** (⚡) | For each **+** level on player board: gain 50€. For each **−** level: pay 100€ **or** add one pollution disc to bottom of Pollution track. |
| **Ecology** (🌿) | For each **+** level: remove one pollution disc from **top** of Pollution track. If no discs remain, gain 50€ per level. For each **−** level: add one pollution disc to bottom of track. |
| **Capital** (€) | Gain 100€ for each Capital symbol on player board. |
| **Research** (🔍) | Move forward one space on Research track per Research symbol. Movement can be split between Energy and Ecology research tracks. |
| **Prosperity** (🌐) | Gain 1 VP per Prosperity symbol on player board **only if** there are **no pollution discs** in the top triangle space of Pollution track. If there is ≥1 disc in the triangle, score **0**. |

- After all players resolve the scoring, active player places the drawn tile next to the Research board according to its type and level (left for Energy, right for Ecology, correct level row).  

#### B. Action Phase  
Active player takes **2 actions** (can repeat same action twice). Options:  

1. **Revenue**: Take 100€ from the bank.  
2. **Clean-Up**: Remove the **topmost** pollution disc from your Pollution track.  
3. **Research**: Move one of your Research markers forward **1 space** on either Energy or Ecology research track.  
4. **Purchase Tile**:  
   - Buy one visible tile (next to Research board).  
   - Cost depends on your current Research level vs. tile level:  
     - Same level: 100€  
     - Tile lower: 50€  
     - Tile higher: 100€ + 100€ per level above yours  
   - Place tile on your player board:  
     - Must match background color (pink/yellow/green/blue).  
     - Can cover existing tile (only one tile per space).  
     - Special tiles (non-infrastructure): apply immediate effect (e.g., VP, remove pollution), then discard.  
   - After placement:  
     - Update total Energy and Ecology symbols on your board (add new, subtract covered).  
     - Some blue spaces are blocked until a transport tile covers the "X" space of the same color.  

> **Note**: Money is public information. Players may recalculate Energy/Ecology totals at any time.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends at the end of the turn when the last Technology tile is drawn (36th turn). Final scoring occurs in this order:  

1. **Energy (×2)**:  
   - Score Energy as during game, **twice**.  
   - For each **+** level: gain 50€.  
   - For each **−** level: pay 100€ **or** add one pollution disc.  

2. **Ecology (×2)**:  
   - Score Ecology as during game, **twice**.  
   - For each **+** level: remove one disc. If none left, gain 50€ per level.  
   - For each **−** level: add one disc.  

3. **Capital**:  
   - Gain 100€ per Capital symbol.  
   - Discard all money. Gain **1 VP per 300€ discarded** (round down).  
   - Keep leftover money for tiebreaker.  

4. **Research**:  
   - Move Research markers forward equal to number of Research symbols on player board (split between tracks).  
   - Bonus VP:  
     - **+3 VP** to highest on each research track.  
     - **+1 VP** to second-highest.  
     - **Tie for 1st**: both get **+2 VP**, no 2nd place awarded.  
     - **Tie for 2nd**: **no VP** awarded for 2nd place.  

5. **Prosperity**:  
   - Score 1 VP per Prosperity symbol on player board (including those on Pollution track).  
   - **Only if** there are **no pollution discs** in the top triangle space.  

**Winning**: Player with most VP wins.  
**Tiebreaker**: Most leftover money.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Pollution Track Capacity**: All spaces hold one disc except the top triangle, which can hold unlimited.  
- **Scoring Symbols**: Only the white-bordered symbol on the drawn tile is scored this turn.  
- **Tile Placement**: Tiles must match color of space. Cannot move or rotate tiles.  
- **Covered Symbols**: When a tile is covered, its symbols no longer count.  
- **Unusable Blue Spaces**: Only become active when the "X" transport tile of same color is placed.  
- **Money Handling**: All money is public. No hidden funds.  
- **Score Track Overflow**: VP can exceed 50; wrap around and remember to add 50 in final count.  
- **Research Track Limits**: No maximum; players can exceed printed numbers.
