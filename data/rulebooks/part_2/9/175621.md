## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The first war of the gods destroyed the universe, leading to a new agreement: gods now wage war through champions in the mortal realm, bound by strict rules. Players take on the role of divine patrons, using champions and events to battle opponents.  

**Objective**: Be the last player standing by reducing all opponents to 0 or less health, or win by making an opponent attempt to draw from an empty deck.

### 2. Components  
- 120 game cards (Epic card back)  
- 8 double-sided tokens (used as token champions)  
- Rules booklet  

Cards are divided into two types: Champions and Events. Tokens represent champions when needed; substitutes (e.g., paper) may be used if tokens run out.

---

### 3. Setup  
For a basic two-player game:  
1. Shuffle all 120 cards.  
2. Deal 30 cards to each player to form their decks.  
3. Each player places their deck nearby with space for a face-up discard pile.  
4. Each player starts with 30 health (tracked via dice, pen and paper, or app).  
5. Randomly determine the first player.  
6. Each player draws a 5-card starting hand.  
7. Starting with the second player, each may perform a mulligan.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in turns. Only one player has initiative at a time. The turn sequence is as follows:

#### Start Phase  
- Both players lose any unspent gold and gain 1 gold.  
- The current player draws 1 card (skip on the first player’s first turn).  
- All champions are prepared (flipped back to upright position).  
- Resolve any “At the start of turn” triggered abilities.

#### Main Phase  
- The active player may:  
  - Play cards (if able).  
  - Use powers.  
  - Declare Battle Phases.  
- After declaring they wish to end their turn, the opponent gains initiative and may:  
  - Make plays (events or powers).  
  - Pass initiative back.  
- If the opponent made plays, the active player resumes their Main Phase.  
- If not, proceed to the End Phase.

#### Battle Phase  
Each battle consists of five steps:

1. **Choose Attackers Step**  
   - Attacking player selects prepared champions to attack.  
   - Expended champions cannot attack.  
   - Deploying champions (played this turn) cannot attack unless they have Blitz.  
   - Selected attackers are expended (turned sideways).

2. **Before Blocks Step**  
   - Attacker may make plays, then pass initiative.  
   - Defender may respond with plays or advance to Choose Blockers.  
   - Initiative passes back and forth until one player advances.

3. **Choose Blockers Step**  
   - Defender selects prepared champions to block.  
   - Blocking champions are flipped (rotated 180°).  
   - Only prepared champions may block.  
   - If any attacker is blocked, the entire attack is considered blocked—even unblockable champions.

4. **Before Damage Step**  
   - Defender may make plays, then pass.  
   - Attacker may respond or advance to Damage step.  
   - Repeat until one advances.

5. **Damage Step**  
   - No cards or powers may be played.  
   - All attacking and blocking champions deal damage simultaneously equal to their Offense.  
   - Attacking champions deal damage to blockers (or defending player if unblocked).  
   - Blocking champions deal damage to attackers.  
   - Controller of each champion chooses how to assign its damage (can split among multiple targets).  
   - Champions that take damage ≥ their Defense in a single turn are **broken** and placed in their owner’s discard pile.  
   - Resolve triggered abilities from damage.  
   - Resolve “At end of combat” triggers (starting with active player).  
   - Attacking player returns to Main Phase and may attack again.

#### End Phase  
- No cards or powers may be played.  
- Resolve “At end of turn” triggered abilities (starting with active player).  
- Active player discards down to 7 cards if holding more.  
- All damage is removed from champions.  
- All flipped champions are prepared.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Types  
- **Champions**: Stay in play. Can attack, block, use powers. Played during Main Phase unless they have Ambush.  
- **Events**: One-time effects. Can be played during any player’s turn when allowed (e.g., during Battle Phase responses).

#### Cost  
- Each card has a cost in the upper-right corner: 0 (free) or 1 (gold).  
- Each turn, a player gains 1 gold at the start of their turn.  
- Paying 1 cost removes that gold for the turn.

#### Alignment  
- Four alignments (colors). No deck-building restrictions, but some cards reward alignment consistency (e.g., Ally Abilities, Loyalty).

#### Champion Status  
- **Prepared (vertical)**: Can attack, block, or use expend powers.  
- **Expended (horizontal)**: Cannot attack, block, or use expend powers. Results from attacking or using an expend power.  
- **Flipped (180°)**: Result of blocking. Cannot block again this turn but can use expend powers.

#### Deploying  
- A champion is **deploying** until the controller begins a turn with it in play.  
- Deploying champions:  
  - Cannot attack (unless Blitz).  
  - Cannot use powers (unless Blitz).  
  - Can block.

#### Keywords  
- **Airborne**: Can only be blocked by Airborne champions.  
- **Ally Ability (→)**: Triggers when playing a 1-cost card of the specified alignment. Free cards do not trigger.  
- **Ambush**: Champion may be played whenever an Event can be played (including during opponent’s turn). Still subject to deploying rules.  
- **Banish**: Card is placed on the bottom of its owner’s deck. If multiple cards are banished simultaneously, shuffle them before placing.  
- **Blitz**: May attack and use 1-cost powers while deploying.  
- **Break**: Champion is broken (sent to discard pile) if it takes damage ≥ its Defense in a single turn.  
- **Breakthrough**: After assigning lethal damage to each blocker, excess damage from Breakthrough champions can be assigned to the defending player. Only Breakthrough champions contribute.  
- **Loyalty 2**: When this champion enters play, you may reveal 2 cards of its alignment in hand. If you do, gain the effect listed.  
- **Tribute**: When this champion enters play, gain the effect listed.  
- **Recall**: Move a card from discard pile to hand.  
- **Recycle**: Optional. Banish 2 cards from discard pile to draw 1 card.  
- **Righteous**: When this champion deals damage, gain that much health.  
- **Token Champions**: Treated like normal champions, but when they leave play, return them to the token pile (not hand, deck, or discard).  
- **Transform**: Remove the card from play, put it on the bottom of its owner’s deck, and put a token into play as a new champion. Does not count as banishing.  
- **Unblockable**: Cannot be blocked.  
- **Unbanishable**: While in play, cannot be banished.  
- **Untargetable**: While in play, cannot be targeted by events, powers, or abilities. Can still be damaged in combat or affected by non-targeting effects (e.g., Apocalypse).  
- **Unbreakable**: Cannot be broken by damage or break effects. If a power requires breaking an Unbreakable champion, that power cannot be used.

#### Powers and Abilities  
- **Powers**: Active abilities. Format: [cost]: [effect]. Example: : Deal 2 damage to a target.  
- **Abilities**: Passive. Two types:  
  - **Continuous**: Always active while in play (e.g., “Your Human champions get +1”).  
  - **Triggered**: Activate when condition is met. Marked with →. Example: “When this is broken → Draw a card.”  
  - Triggered abilities resolve the next time any player could play cards. All triggers must resolve before further plays.

#### Initiative and Triggers  
- Only one player has initiative at a time.  
- When multiple triggered abilities occur:  
  - Player with initiative resolves all their triggers first (in any order).  
  - Then the next player (clockwise) resolves theirs.  
  - After all triggers resolve, the player with initiative resumes play.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

- Their health is 0 or less.  
- They attempt to draw a card but have no cards left in their deck.  

A player **wins** if:  
- All opponents are eliminated.  
- They are the last player remaining in multiplayer.
