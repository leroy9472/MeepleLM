## Northern Pacific — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Northern Pacific is a strategic tile placement and network-building game where players compete to construct the most efficient railway from Minneapolis to Seattle. The objective is to maximize your score over three rounds by placing cubes in cities and building train routes, scoring points based on remaining cubes in supply and on the board.

### 2. Components
- Game board showing a network of cities connected by directional routes
- Large (enhanced) and small game cubes in player colors
- Score track with two markers per player (one large cube, one small cube)
- General supply of cubes

### 3. Setup
- Place the board within reach of all players.
- Each player receives:
  - 1 large (big) cube
  - 3 small cubes
- Place each player’s large and small cubes on the starting space (0) of the score track.
- The game begins with the first player; turn order may be randomized (per Winsome Games edition).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns in clockwise or randomized order. On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

#### Action 1: Place a Cube in a City
- Place one of your small cubes in an unoccupied city.
- Restrictions:
  - The city must **not** already be connected to Minneapolis by a completed train route.
  - You **cannot** place a cube in Seattle.
  - City capacity limits apply:
    - 3 players: max 2 cubes per city
    - 4–5 players: max 3 cubes per city
    - 6 players: max 4 cubes per city
- Only one cube per player per city allowed.

#### Action 2: Place a Train (Build Railway)
- Place a train segment along a route connecting two adjacent cities.
- Must follow directional arrows on the board.
- The first train placed must originate from Minneapolis.
- Subsequent trains must connect to an existing segment in your network.
- No branching: your railway must form a single continuous path (no forks).

#### When a City is Connected to Minneapolis:
- Any player who has a cube in that city immediately:
  - Removes their cube from the city
  - Scores replacement cubes from the general supply:
    - Small cube → 1 small cube
    - Large cube → 2 small cubes
- This occurs as soon as connectivity is established, even if it's not your turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Network Growth**: Players expand their rail network step-by-step from Minneapolis toward Seattle.
- **Cube Placement Strategy**: Placing cubes in cities not yet connected allows future scoring when those cities are linked.
- **Resource Management**: Cubes are both placement tools and score indicators. Losing cubes from your supply during scoring impacts future flexibility.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
#### End of Round
- The round ends **immediately** when a train segment connects the network to **Seattle**.
- Then, conduct scoring in this order:
  1. **Personal Supply Count**:
     - Each player counts all cubes in their personal supply (regardless of size).
     - Move their **large cube** on the score track forward by this number.
     - (Note: Big cubes count as 1 point during scoring.)
  2. **On-Board Cube Count**:
     - Each player counts all cubes they still have placed on the board.
     - Move their **small cube** on the score track forward by this number.
- After scoring:
  - Reset the board: return all cubes to the general supply.
  - Replenish each player’s stock: 1 large cube + 3 small cubes.
  - Begin the next round.

#### Game End
- The game ends after **three rounds**.
- Final winner is determined by:
  - Highest position of the **large cube** on the score track.
  - In case of a tie: the tied player with the **lower small cube** score wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I place a train that doesn’t extend my own network?**  
  No. All train placements must be part of your continuous path starting from Minneapolis.

- **Do I score when someone else connects a city I’ve placed a cube in?**  
  Yes. As soon as a city becomes connected to Minneapolis (by any player), all players with cubes there reclaim cubes from the supply.

- **Can I place a cube in a city that will be connected later in the same turn?**  
  Yes, as long as it is not currently connected to Minneapolis.

- **Is turn order randomized between rounds?**  
  Not required by core rules, but recommended by designer Tom Russell (RGG version).

- **Are there variants?**  
  Rio Grande Games edition includes:
  - Single-round game
  - Scoreless (casual) game
  - Two-player variant (not in original box rules)
