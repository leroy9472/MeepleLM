## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Bonaparte at Marengo is a block wargame simulating the Battle of Marengo (1800), where Napoleon’s French forces face off against the Austrian army in a bid for control of key positions on the battlefield. The game emphasizes command timing, morale, and tactical use of terrain. The objective is either to demoralize the enemy army by the end of the game or to control key objective locations.

2. Components  
- Game board with locales, approaches, roads, and terrain symbols  
- Wooden or cardboard blocks representing infantry, cavalry, and artillery units (with hidden strength values)  
- Turn Track (marked in hourly increments from 6am to 10pm)  
- Morale Track (for tracking French and Austrian army morale)  
- Markers: black (turn), red and blue (morale)  
- Reinforcement boxes (off-board areas for incoming units)  
- Rulebook (implied by procedures)

3. Setup  
- Place the black marker at 6am on the Turn Track. Red and blue markers start on their respective Morale Tracks.  
- French units are drawn blindly from a pool and placed in designated French setup locales as shown on the board schematics. These units begin **inactive** (cannot move unless activated).  
- Austrian units do not set up on the board initially; they enter only as reinforcements.  
- Blocks in a locale are either in **Reserve** or at an **Approach**. Locale capacity limits must be observed at all times.  
- Inactive French units cannot move but may block or retreat from enemy Manoeuvre Attacks.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game consists of **16 Rounds**, each with two turns:  
1. Austrian Turn  
2. French Turn  

Each turn follows this sequence:  
- Start of Round: Active player gains 5 Morale Points if their army is not Demoralized and the opponent is.  
- Resolve declared Artillery Bombardments (Austrian turn only at start).  
- Conduct Assaults (Infantry/Cavalry).  
- Conduct Movement (including Road Movement and Reinforcements).  
- Declare future Artillery Bombardments.  
- Turn non-bombarding artillery face down.  
- End of turn; proceed to next player or round.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Army Demoralisation**  
- Each combat loss reduces Army Morale by 1 point.  
- If an army’s Morale reaches 0, it becomes **Demoralized**.  
- At the start of the next Round, if one army is Demoralized and the other is not, the non-Demoralized army gains 5 Morale Points.

**French Activation**  
- On French Turn 1: French player may freely activate 1 unit.  
- On subsequent French turns: May activate 2 units if:  
  - A French setup locale has ever been enemy-occupied, or  
  - It is 11am or later.  
- Any French unit adjacent to an Austrian-occupied locale at the start of the French turn becomes **automatically active**.  
- Active and inactive units must be kept separate.  
- Inactive units can still block or retreat from Manoeuvre Attacks.

**Artillery Bombardment (Austrian First, Then French)**  
- Only artillery units at an **Approach** (not in Reserve) may bombard.  
- Bombardment is optional and declared at end of turn; resolved at start of next turn.  
- Artillery that fires cannot move or assault this turn, except to retreat to Reserve if the adjacent locale becomes unopposed.  
- Bombardment can be voluntarily cancelled (turn unit face down).  
- Bombardment Procedure:  
  - Target selection:  
    1. Enemy units in adjacent Approach (must target if present)  
    2. Else: enemy in Reserve of adjacent locale  
    3. Else: enemy in another Approach of the same locale  
  - Bombardment strength = artillery strength  
    - Minus 1 per artillery penalty symbol in the defending Approach (if target is there)  
  - Defender chooses which unit takes losses equal to net strength. Replace with reduced-strength unit or eliminate.  
  - Each hit reduces Army Morale by 1.  
  - Damaged defending unit is re-hidden; bombarding artillery remains face up until end of turn.

**Assault Procedure**  
An Assault is a movement across an enemy-occupied Approach.  
- Max 3 Assaults/Moves per turn (combined total).  
- A Demoralized Army cannot initiate new Assaults.  
- Attacking force must start in adjacent Approach.  
- Only one Assault per Approach per turn.  
- At least one lead unit (infantry or cavalry, strength ≥2) required.  
- If Approach has **cavalry-obstructed** symbol, cavalry cannot lead.  

Steps:  
1. Attacker declares lead unit(s):  
   - 1 or 2 leads if Approach is wide; only 1 otherwise.  
   - All leads must be same type (infantry or cavalry), strength ≥2.  
   - Each lead’s strength must exceed terrain penalty for its type.  
   - Turn lead units face up.  
2. Defender may declare artillery defense if:  
   - Artillery is present, did not fire or declare bombardment last turn.  
   - Turn artillery face up.  
   - Resolve: reduce attacking strength by 1 per artillery symbol.  
     - Attacker assigns losses (enemy’s choice) to lead units first, then others (owner’s choice).  
     - Each hit reduces Army Morale.  
3. Defender declares lead unit(s):  
   - 0, 1, or 2 (if wide); 0 or 1 otherwise.  
   - All leads same type; cavalry cannot lead if obstructed.  
   - Turn leads face up.  
4. Calculate assault strength:  
   - Sum of surviving lead attackers  
   - -1 per matching penalty symbol in defending Approach  
   - -1 per attacking unit if their Army is Demoralized  
5. Calculate result:  
   - Subtract sum of defending lead units from assault strength  
   - -1 per defending unit if their Army is Demoralized  
   - If result > 0: attacker wins  
   - If result ≤ 0: defender wins  
6. Apply losses:  
   - Winner: 1 loss  
   - Loser: 1 + |final result| losses  
   - Lead units take hits first (enemy chooses), then others (owner chooses)  
   - Each hit reduces Army Morale  
7. Cavalry Pursuit (if applicable):  
   - Possible if:  
     - Winner had non-leading cavalry in assault  
     - Loser did not have cavalry as lead units  
   - Declare 1 or 2 pursuing cavalry (if wide)  
   - No pursuit if cavalry-obstructed symbol in either Approach  
   - Pursuit strength = sum of pursuing cavalry -1 per cavalry penalty in fleeing Approach  
   - Pursuer takes 1 loss; pursued takes losses equal to final pursuit strength  
   - Each hit reduces Army Morale  
8. Ownership of locale:  
   - If defender wins: attackers return to Reserve; defenders remain at Approach  
   - If attacker wins: defenders must Retreat; attackers advance to Reserve of new locale  
     - Cavalry may perform **Continuation** to block an Approach in the new locale (counts against move/assault limit)

**Retreat Procedure**  
- All units in locale turned face up and must retreat:  
  - Artillery units are **eliminated**  
  - One hit applied to one Reserve infantry (owner’s choice)  
  - One hit applied to one infantry or cavalry in each Approach (except the one just assaulted)  
  - Each hit reduces Army Morale  
- Units retreat to Reserve of adjacent locale(s), re-hidden after  
- Cannot retreat:  
  - Into attack locale  
  - Across impassable Approach  
  - Into enemy-occupied locale  
  - Beyond locale capacity  
- Units unable to retreat are **eliminated**; Army Morale reduced by total strength points lost

**Movement Procedure**  
- Max 3 Moves/Assaults per turn (combined).  
- A unit that assaulted cannot move.  
- Units move in **groups** (same start and end point).  
- Secondary road moves count as separate groups.  
- **Primary road movement**: Unlimited free movement per turn.  
- Locale capacity must always be respected.  
- Movement options:  
  - Reserve → Approach (only if adjacent locale has enemy)  
    - Cavalry may do this "for free" via **Continuation** on primary road  
  - Approach → Reserve (if adjacent enemy leaves)  
  - Reserve → Reserve (adjacent locale)  
    - Only if destination Approach is enemy-free and not impassable  
    - Triggers **Manoeuvre Attack** if destination locale has enemy units  
    - Force must include infantry if crossing cavalry-obstructed Approach  
  - Approach → Reserve (same locale)  
  - Approach → Reserve (adjacent locale)  
    - Same conditions as above; triggers Manoeuvre Attack if enemy present  

**Road Movement**  
- Units starting in Reserve can move up to 3 enemy-free locales along connected roads, ending in Reserve.  
- Movement along **only primary roads** does not count against move/assault limit.  
- Only **cavalry** can use road movement to enter enemy-occupied locale (Manoeuvre Attack)  
  - Counts against move/assault limit unless via primary road  
- Max 3 units may cross any Approach per road per turn:  
  - 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moves must be in order (see illustration)  
- Cavalry may **continue** to block an Approach in destination locale if enemy-free (counts unless on primary road)

**Reinforcements**  
- Enter via reinforcement boxes using road movement.  
- Can be voluntarily delayed.  
- Movement allowance based on entry order:  
  - 1st reinforcing unit: 3 locales  
  - 2nd: 2 locales  
  - 3rd: 1 locale  
- Cannot exceed locale capacity or enter enemy-occupied locale.  
- Austrians may bring **1 additional** reinforcing unit per turn via pontoon bridge using non-road movement (counts against move/assault limit)

**Manoeuvre Attack**  
- Triggered when units move into a locale with enemy units.  
- Defender may **block** if:  
  - Attacker started from Reserve  
  - Defender has units in Reserve  
- If blocking:  
  - Defender moves unit(s) from Reserve to blocking Approach  
  - Attacker may:  
    - Return all to Reserve  
    - Leave all blocking opposite Approach  
    - Split group (Reserve and Approach) — costs **1 additional command** (counts toward move/assault limit)  
- If not blocking: defender must **Retreat**  
- Attacker moves into Reserve of destination locale  
- Cavalry using road movement may **continue** and Manoeuvre Attack again

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends at the end of Round 16.  
- **Defeat Condition**: An army is **Demoralized** (Morale = 0) and the opponent is **not** → that army loses.  
- **Victory by Objectives (if no army defeated)**:  
  - Austrians win if they have at least **one unit in 2 or more** of the **8 starred locales**  
  - The two (or more) controlled starred locales must **not be of the same color**  
- Otherwise, French win by default.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can inactive French units ever move?**  
  Only if they become active via activation or adjacency to Austrians at start of French turn.  
- **Can artillery that bombarded last turn move this turn?**  
  No — it cannot move or assault. Exception: may retreat to Reserve if adjacent locale becomes unopposed.  
- **Can multiple bombardments target the same locale?**  
  Yes, if multiple artillery units are in position and declare bombardment.  
- **Can a unit both assault and pursue?**  
  Yes — if it is a non-leading cavalry unit and conditions for pursuit are met.  
- **What happens if a locale is full and a unit tries to enter?**  
  Entry is blocked unless a unit leaves first. Retreats or eliminations may create space.  
- **Do Morale gains from enemy Demoralization stack?**  
  No — only **5 points** are awarded at the start of the next Round, regardless of duration.
