## PALAZZO — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   Set in 15th-century Florence during a cultural and economic boom, players take on the roles of master builders competing to construct the most impressive palaces. The goal is to earn the most victory points by building palaces with high floor counts, many windows/doors, and uniform building materials. The player with the highest victory point total at game end wins.

2. **Components**  
   - 55 money cards  
     - 3 each of values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 in three different currencies (9 × 5 = 45 cards)  
     - 10 value 2 certificates ("jokers") – currency-neutral  
   - 1 master builder (wooden figure)  
   - 8 frames:  
     - 4 quarries (rectangular)  
     - 1 material supply (square)  
   - 48 building tiles:  
     - Represent 3 materials: brick, sandstone, marble  
     - 5 floor levels (1 = ground floor, 5 = roof)  
     - Each tile has 1–3 windows or doors (collectively referred to as "windows")  
     - 3 complete palaces per color (each with 5 floors)  
   - 5 rider tiles ("game end" or "knight" tiles) – signal game end  
   - 1 value 3 certificate (currency-neutral, used as starting bid in auctions)  
   - 4 summary cards (1 per player; show VP scoring rules)

3. **Setup**  
   - Place the material supply in the center; arrange the 4 quarries around it.  
   - Place the master builder on any quarry.  
   - Sort building tiles by back-side Roman numerals (I, II, III); shuffle each pile.  
   - Shuffle the 5 game end tiles into the III stack.  
   - Place the three stacks (I, II, III) face down near the material supply.  
   - Draw the top 5 tiles from stack I and place one face up on each quarry and the material supply (5 total: 4 on quarries, 1 on supply).  
   - Place the value 3 certificate face up near the material supply.  
   - Shuffle money cards and place face down as a draw stack.  
   - Each player draws 4 money cards (kept secret) and takes 1 summary card.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   Play proceeds clockwise. On a turn, a player must choose **one** of the following actions:

   > **1. Take Money**  
   > - Draw (number of players + 1) money cards face up.  
   > - The active player chooses 2 cards to add to their hand.  
   > - Other players, in clockwise order, each choose 1 remaining card.  
   > - Discard pile is reshuffled if draw stack is exhausted.  
   > - Cannot take this action if insufficient cards remain to complete the draw.

   > **2. Buy or Auction Building Tiles**  
   > - Draw the top 2 tiles from the current stack (I → II → III).  
   > - Place the first tile face up on the **material supply**.  
   > - Place the second tile face up on a **quarry** based on its window count:  
   >   - 1 window → quarry 1 (starting from master builder as 0, count clockwise)  
   >   - 2 windows → quarry 2  
   >   - 3 windows → quarry 3  
   >   - (No tile goes to quarry 4; quarries are labeled 1–3 only)  
   > - Then, choose **one**:
   >
   >   **a) Buy Tiles**  
   >   - Can only buy from the **material supply**.  
   >   - Must buy 1 or 2 tiles.  
   >   - Price per tile: **10 – (number of tiles in material supply at start of turn)**.  
   >   - Total cost is sum of individual prices (not recalculated per tile).  
   >   - Pay using cards of **one currency only**, plus any jokers (value 2 or 3 certificates).  
   >   - May overpay; no change given.  
   >   - Must build all purchased tiles immediately (or discard them).  
   >
   >   **b) Auction Tiles**  
   >   - Move master builder clockwise to the next quarry with at least one tile.  
   >   - All tiles on that quarry are auctioned.  
   >   - Active player starts by placing the value 3 certificate as their first bid.  
   >   - Bidding proceeds clockwise. Each player must either:  
   >     - Pass (and take back all their bid cards)  
   >     - Or raise the bid with a higher total using valid card combinations  
   >   - Valid bids:  
   >     - Cards of one currency + jokers  
   >     - Groups of 3 cards: same value in all three currencies = 15 (regardless of face value)  
   >     - Three value 2 certificates = 15  
   >     - Groups must be played together to count as 15  
   >   - A player who passes cannot re-enter the auction.  
   >   - Auction ends when only one player remains.  
   >   - Winner pays all bid cards (to discard), takes all auctioned tiles, and builds them immediately (or discards).  
   >   - Return the value 3 certificate to the side.
   >
   >   **Exception: 4 or More Tiles on a Quarry**  
   >   - If the quarry has 4+ tiles when master builder arrives, **no auction** occurs.  
   >   - Active player takes 1 tile and builds it.  
   >   - Other players, in clockwise order, each take 1 tile and build it.  
   >   - Any remaining tiles are returned face down to the box (removed from game).  
   >   - This can only happen when a player chooses the "auction" action and moves the master builder.

   > **3. Tile Reconstruction**  
   > - Costs: discard **one** money card (any value, any currency).  
   > - Cannot be taken if player has no money cards.  
   > - Player may perform **one** of the following:
   >   - Remove a tile from one of their palaces and place it as a standalone (new palace).  
   >   - Take a standalone tile (single-tile palace) and insert it into an existing palace (on top, bottom, or between tiles).  
   >   - Discard a standalone tile (return face down to box).  
   > - Cannot move a tile directly from one palace to another in one action.  
   > - After reconstruction, the tile must still obey building rules.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Building Rules**  
     1. Floors must be in ascending order (e.g., 1,3,4 allowed; 3,1,2 not).  
     2. No duplicate floor numbers in a palace (e.g., 2,4,4,5 invalid).  
     3. Multiple building materials allowed; uniform material gives bonus.  
     4. Window count may vary per floor.  
     5. New tiles normally placed **on top**; insertion requires **reconstruction**.  
     6. Players may build multiple palaces.  
     7. Any acquired tile (via buy/auction) must be built **immediately** or discarded.  
     8. Only way to modify built tiles is via **reconstruction**.

   - **Money & Payment Rules**  
     - Payments must use cards of **one currency only**, plus any number of jokers (value 2 or 3 certificates).  
     - Exception: 3 cards of same value in all three currencies = 15 (neutral).  
     - Three value 2 certificates = 15.  
     - Groups must be played together to count as 15.  
     - No hand limit for money cards.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - The game ends **immediately** when the **fifth game end tile** is drawn (from any stack, during "Buy or Auction" action).  
   - No further turns are taken.  
   - **Victory Points (VP) per Palace:**  
     - 1 floor: –5 VP  
     - 2 floors: 0 VP  
     - 3 floors: total number of windows  
     - 4 floors: total windows + 3  
     - 5 floors: total windows + 6  
   - **Material Uniformity Bonus (if all tiles same material):**  
     - 1–2 floors: +0 VP  
     - 3–4 floors: +3 VP  
     - 5 floors: +6 VP  
   - **Tiebreaker:** Player with the highest single-currency bid value in hand wins (using one currency + jokers + groups of 3). Only one bid combination counts.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Can I skip a floor?** Yes (e.g., build 1,3,5).  
   - **Can I have multiple palaces?** Yes, but 1-floor palaces score –5 VP.  
   - **Can I discard a tile after buying/auctioning?** Yes, instead of building.  
   - **Can I use the value 3 certificate in payments?** Yes – it's a currency-neutral 3-value joker.  
   - **Can I place a tile under an existing one without reconstruction?** No – only via reconstruction.  
   - **What if no quarry has tiles during auction?** Player may still choose "auction" action, but nothing happens.  
   - **Can I rebuild a tile and then rebuild it again later?** Yes, as long as you pay the cost each time.  
   - **Can I use multiple 15-value groups in one payment?** Yes.  
   - **Do game end tiles replace themselves?** No – they are placed beside the board; no replacement tile is drawn.
