## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the Ambourella system, players act as commanders of the Cosmic Hansa, transporting goods and passengers between six planets to earn Megagalax (currency). The goal is to be the first to reach 70 Megagalax, marked by advancing a spaceship along the sun spiral toward the center. The game ends immediately when a player reaches 70 Megagalax. Alternatively, if all goods cards are removed from the game, the player with the most Megagalax wins; in case of a tie, the player with more technology cards wins. If still tied, the game ends in a draw.

2. Components  
- Game board showing the sun spiral (0 to 70 Megagalax)  
- Six planet tiles: Coronis, Naginther, Vinau II, Taghellia, Talmazzar, Dahkit  
- Two player sets:  
  - Miniature spaceship (flat or round)  
  - 30-card deck (unique backs per player)  
  - Start Card (shows "Container" and "Replenishment" technologies)  
  - Container cards (2 per player)  
  - Replenishment cards (2 per player)  
- 30 goods cards (5 per planet)  
- One six-sided die  
- Intervention and technology cards (included in player decks)

3. Setup  
- Each player selects a spaceship and corresponding card deck.  
- Find and place the Start Card face up in front of you. Shuffle the remaining 29 cards into a draw pile. Draw 5 cards to form your starting hand.  
- Place the sun at one edge of the table and arrange the six planets in a row beside it.  
- Place 5 goods cards at each planet, face up, showing the destination planet. If a card shows the planet it’s on, flip it to the other side (destination will differ).  
- Group goods cards at each planet by destination (overlap horizontally).  
- Each player places their spaceship on the 0 Megagalax space (outermost dot) of the sun spiral.  
- Youngest player chooses either to take the first turn or to select the starting planet for both spaceships. The other player makes the remaining choice.  
- The starting player takes the die.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, they may perform in any order:  
- Up to 1 Flight Action  
- Up to 2 Planetary Actions  
- Up to 2 Intervention Cards  

The turn ends with:  
- Discarding unwanted cards  
- Drawing one card per Replenishment technology (including Start Card), up to a max of 5 hand cards.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Flight Action (1 per turn)**  
- Roll the die. If a "1" is rolled, reroll and add the 1 to the total; repeat until a number >1 is rolled.  
- Total = energy units available for movement.  
- Player may use any number of energy units.  
- Flight ends when:  
  - Spaceship lands on a planet  
  - A planetary action is performed  
  - Player chooses not to move (even after rolling)  
- Movement rules:  
  - Leaving or landing on a planet costs 1 energy unit.  
  - Moving toward the sun (right to left): only count planet orbits (no gap cost).  
  - Moving away from the sun (left to right): count gaps (black dots) between orbits—each gap costs 1 energy unit.  

**Planetary Actions (up to 2 per turn, spaceship must be on a planet)**  
- Load One Container:  
  - Load an empty Container (Start Card or technology) with all goods cards at the current planet that share the same destination.  
  - Must take all cards of that destination.  
  - Cannot look at the back of goods cards.  
  - A loaded Container cannot be modified until unloaded.  
- Unload One Container:  
  - Only allowed on the destination planet shown on the goods.  
  - Must unload all goods in the Container.  
  - Gain Megagalax as shown on each card (2 or 3).  
  - Bonus: +1 Megagalax per card if no goods were present at the planet before unloading.  
  - After unloading, flip the goods cards and place them at the planet, grouped by destination.  
  - Pair Removal:  
    - If two cards now show the same destination, remove both from the game.  
    - If two such pairs appear, player chooses which pair to remove; the other stays.  
- Buy a Technology:  
  - Play a technology card from hand face up.  
  - Cost = number of face-up technology cards you have at the start of your turn (including Start Card).  
  - Pay by moving your spaceship backward on the sun spiral.  
  - Effect is permanent.  

**Interventions (up to 2 per turn, any time)**  
- Discard the card to activate its effect.  
- Opponent may neutralize by discarding an identical intervention card from their hand—except "Passenger", which cannot be neutralized.  
- Key Intervention Effects:  
  - **Passenger**: Play only if on the destination planet. Gain 3 Megagalax. Cannot be neutralized.  
  - **Agent Infiltration**: Take an additional Planetary Action.  
  - **Afterburner Ignition**: Take an additional Flight Action (no extra actions or interventions).  
  - **Sun Tunneling**: During flight, move from orbit of innermost to outermost planet for 1 energy unit.  
  - **Inner/Outer Loading**: Load a Container from the two innermost or outermost planets, regardless of your position. Does not count against Planetary Action limit.  
  - **On-Board Transmitter**: Swap contents of one of your loaded Containers with one of opponent’s (both must have goods).  
  - **Transmitter Gate**: Swap positions of your spaceship and opponent’s.  
  - **Hyperstorm Release**: Discard hand, shuffle draw and discard piles, draw 5 new cards. Turn ends.  

**End of Turn**  
- Discard any number of cards.  
- Draw one card per Replenishment technology you have (including Start Card), up to 5 cards total in hand.  
- Pass the die to the opponent.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Scoring occurs during Unload actions and Passenger interventions:  
  - Points from goods cards (2 or 3 per card)  
  - 1 bonus point per card unloaded if destination had no goods before  
  - 3 points for playing "Passenger"  
- Game ends when:  
  - A player reaches 70 Megagalax → immediate win.  
  - All goods cards are removed from the game → highest Megagalax wins. Tiebreaker: most technology cards. Still tied → draw.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you perform actions in orbit?** Only with "Orbital Station" technology: allows one Planetary Action per turn from orbit (not for Passenger).  
- **Can you move without using energy?** No—rolling the die uses up your Flight Action, even if you don’t move.  
- **Can you load partial goods?** No—must load all goods of one destination at a planet.  
- **Can you unload on a planet with existing goods?** Yes—no bonus, but new flipped goods are grouped.  
- **What if draw pile runs out?** Shuffle discard pile to form new draw pile. Repeat as needed.  
- **Hyperjump Technologies**: "Hyperjump Inward/Outward" move your ship to the orbit of the innermost/outermost planet at the start of your turn. Not a flight—normal flight still allowed.  
- **Multiple Containers**: Each requires a full Planetary Action to load/unload. More Containers allow multi-route transport.
