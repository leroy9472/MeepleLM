### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Funny Friends*, players experience life from puberty onward, making choices that shape their personality and relationships. Each decision—whether to smoke, drink, fall in love, or raise children—alters their character profile. The goal is to fulfill five Life Aims (personal goals) or a combination of Life and Mega-Aims. The first player to complete five such aims wins immediately.

### 2. Components
- 6 Player Boards (one per color)
- 54 Wooden Disks (9 per player color, for tracking characteristics)
- 30 Player Markers (5 per player color, double-sided for gender)
- 40 Neutral Person Markers (for non-player characters)
- 48 Time Markers (currency for auctions)
- 30 Sex / Child Markers
- 30 Complaint Markers (5 per player color, used to join events)
- 140 Cards:
  - Red: Puberty Cards
  - Blue: Life Cards (split into Category A and B)
  - Green: Life Aims (5 categories: Lifestyle, Job, Relationship, Friendship, Spirit)
  - Yellow: Mega-Aims (5 total, revealed one at a time)

### 3. Setup
1. Each player chooses a color and receives:
   - 1 Player Board
   - 9 Wooden Disks (placed on the top row, value 0)
   - 5 Player Markers (set to chosen gender: male or female side up)
   - 5 Complaint Markers (in own color)
2. Set gender balance: total of 5 male and 5 female persons in play (players + neutral persons). If all players choose same gender, one must switch to balance.
3. Select 5 types of Neutral Person Markers (e.g., Ana/Frank, Beate/Oliver, etc.), each with one male and one female side. Prepare one marker per type per player.
4. Shuffle the 35 Life Aims into 5 category decks (7 cards each). Draw 1 card from each category to form 7 sets of 5 cards. Each player draws 1 set (their personal Life Aims).
5. Shuffle the 5 Mega-Aims and place face down; reveal the top card.
6. Place 3 Puberty Cards per player face-up in center (4 per player if 2–3 players).
7. Shuffle Life Cards A and B into two separate decks.
8. Place 8 Time Markers per player in the Bank.
9. Give starting player marker to player with "Great Life Experience" (or determine randomly).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in life periods:

#### Phase 1: Puberty
- Cards: 3 (or 4) Puberty Cards per player face-up.
- Turn Order: Clockwise, starting with designated first player.
- On a turn, choose one action:
  a) **Take a Puberty Card**: Activate it (no requirements). Apply effects to your board.
  b) **Step Out**: Take Time Markers based on player count and exit this phase.
  c) **Fulfill an Aim**: If your profile matches a visible Life or Mega-Aim, claim it.

- Ends when all players have stepped out. Remaining cards are discarded.

#### Phase 2: Real Life (repeats until game end)
- Setup: Reveal 5 Life Cards from Category A and 5 from B (4 each if 2–3 players).
- Turn Order: Starts with player who stepped out first in previous phase.
- On a turn, choose one action:
  a) **Auction a Life Card**: Choose a card you qualify for. Start bid (0+ Time Markers). Bidding proceeds clockwise until one player wins. Winner pays and activates the card.
  b) **Step Out**: Take Time Markers (same chart as Puberty). If bank lacks markers, steal from others.
  c) **Fulfill an Aim**: Claim any Life or Mega-Aim you meet.
  d) **Change Aims**: Pay 4 Time Markers to swap any number of unfulfilled Life Aims with new ones from the same categories.

- Ends when all players step out. Discard remaining cards and start new Real Life phase with fresh cards.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Characteristics
Each player has 9 traits (max 3 points each):
- Smoke, Alcohol, Drugs, Money, Illness, Fat, Sadness, Religion, Wisdom

- Disks start at top (value 0). Move down for each point gained.
- Gaining beyond 3: Keep at 3, but reset the linked characteristic below (e.g., +1 Alcohol at level 3 → Wisdom reset to 0).

#### Circle of Friends
- Bottom of board tracks relationships:
  - Left: "Simply Friends" (non-romantic)
  - Center: Partner fields (In Love → Engaged → Married → Happily Married)
  - Right: Ex-Partner (Separated or Separated-but-Married)

- Markers: Player Markers (other players), Person Markers (neutral persons)
- Only one current partner allowed.

#### Gaining Friends
- Occurs when multiple people participate in an event.
- New friend: place marker in "Simply Friends" field.
- Symmetry: both players add each other’s marker.

#### Relationships
- **New Relationship**: Move partner marker to "In Love". Previous relationship ends (see Separation).
- **Intensify**: Move partner marker right (max at "Happily Married").
- **Marriage**: Reached at "Married" or "Happily Married" field.
- **Separation**: Triggered by new relationship or card effect. Move partner to Ex-Partner field (left if not married, right if married).
- **Divorce**: Ends marriage; move ex to left Ex-Partner field.

#### Sex & Children
- **Anonymous Sex**: Place Sex Marker in bed icon (choose gender).
- **Sex with Person**: Place Sex Marker on their marker.
- **Children**: Place Child Marker on partner’s marker. Only possible with opposite-gender partner.
- Requirements: Cards may require prior sex or specific number of children.

#### Complaint System
- Used when a card involves other people.
- Active player chooses participants.
- Other players may play Complaint Markers (in active player’s color) to request inclusion.
- Active player must prioritize complainers; may counter by playing Complaint Marker in another’s color to force inclusion.
- Complaints only valid for Life Cards, not Aims.

#### Symmetry
All relationship effects (friendship, sex, children, marriage, separation) are mirrored on both players’ boards.

#### Secure Relationships
- "Engaged" and "Happily Married" relationships cannot be broken by outsiders unless the player consents.
- Neutral persons never consent.

#### Priest or Nun Rule
- Player who fulfills "Priest or Nun" aim cannot:
  - Begin new relationships
  - Have sex
- Cannot be chosen for events requiring these.
- Existing relationships and children remain.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Fulfilling an Aim**: Place completed Life or Mega-Aim card face-up in front of you.
- **Win Condition**: First player to fulfill 5 Aims (any mix) wins immediately.
- **Mega-Aims**: Only one visible at a time. When completed, reveal next.
- **No Cards Left**: If Life Card decks are exhausted and cannot be replenished, game ends with no winner ("Failed Existences").

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Order of Effects**: When gaining multiple characteristics, player chooses order. Important when overflow triggers reset.
- **Homosexuality**: Allowed for relationships, sex, marriage. Only opposite-gender pairs can have children.
- **Text Overrides Rules**: Card text takes precedence over general rules.
- **Stepping Out with No Markers**: If bank is empty, player steals remaining Time Markers from others.
- **Auction Rules**: Only players meeting card requirements and not stepped out may bid. If auctioneer loses, their turn continues.
- **Changing Aims**: Must keep same number and categories after swap.
