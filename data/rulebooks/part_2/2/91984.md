## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Quebec*, players represent influential families shaping the city of Quebec from 1608 to 2008. Over four centuries, players construct buildings and gain influence in five zones of power—Religion, Politics, Economy, Culture, and the Citadelle—to earn Victory Points (VPs). The player with the most VPs at the end of the 4th century wins. In case of a tie, all tied players share victory.

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board  
- 44 Building tiles (11 per century, 4 colors)  
- 16 Event cards (4 per century)  
- 11 blue discs (mark available buildings per century)  
- 5 Leader cards (Religious, Political, Economic, Cultural, Leader of the Citadelle)  
- 11 pawns: 2 per player color (1 architect + 1 scoring marker), 1 neutral architect  
- 5 Hand tiles  
- 125 worker cubes (25 per color)  
- 120 ★ tokens (24 per color, used to mark completed buildings)

### 3. Setup  
#### Board Setup  
- Randomly place all 44 Building tiles face-up on matching color spaces. Distribute tiles of each century (I–IV) as evenly as possible across the board.  
- Align the Roman numeral on each tile with its corresponding district (color).  
- Place blue discs on all 11 buildings of the 1st century (Century I).  
- Place the 5 Leader cards face-up beside the board. For 3 players: exclude the Religious leader; use the 2/3-player side of the Cultural leader.  
- Sort Event cards by century. Randomly draw 1 per century. Stack face-down in chronological order. Reveal and read the 1608 event at game start. The 1608 event remains in play until scored or game end.

#### Player Setup  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 1 Hand tile  
  - 2 pawns (1 architect, 1 scoring marker)  
  - ★ tokens  
  - Worker cubes:  
    - 3 players: 25 workers  
    - 4 players: 22 workers  
    - 5 players: 20 workers  
- Place scoring marker on “0” of the scoring track.  
- Place 3 workers on the Hand tile (active); the rest go to supply (passive).  
- First player is chosen randomly. Play proceeds clockwise.

*2-player variant note:*  
- Second player starts with 4 active workers.  
- All leaders used except Religious leader. Use 2-player sides for Political and Economic leaders.  
- Neutral architect is always in play.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, choose **one** of four actions. Passing is not allowed.  
If a player has no active workers and already has a leader, they **must** choose “Start a new building.”

#### 1. Start a New Building  
**If architect is not in play (e.g., start of game):**  
1. Move architect to any current-century building with a blue disc. Remove and set aside the blue disc.  
2. Activate 3 workers (move from supply to Hand tile).  

**If architect is on a building:**  
1. Remove architect from current building.  
2. Move all workers from that building to the zone of power matching the building’s color.  
3. Flip the tile to its completed side.  
4. Place a ★ token on the building showing as many stars as there were contributions (1★, 2★, or 3★). If no contributions, do **not** place a ★ token.  
5. Move architect to a new available building of the current century. Remove its blue disc.  
6. Activate 3 workers.  

*Exception:* If no buildings are available when starting a new building:  
- Immediately trigger end of century.  
- After scoring, place architect and activate workers.

#### 2. Contribute to a Building  
- Place **exactly** 1–3 active workers on an open space of a building with an architect (any player’s).  
- Each contribution fills one space. Max 3 contributions per building.  
- Must match the number of workers required (shown in gray circle on tile).  
- If contributing to **another player’s building** (their architect is present), perform that building’s **additional action** (based on district color).  
- Additional actions use **passive workers** (from supply), unless supply is empty (then use active).  
- You **cannot** perform additional actions when contributing to your own building.  
- You may partially perform an additional action.

#### 3. Put a Worker in a Zone of Power  
- Place 1 active worker into any zone of power (including Citadelle).  
- Cannot choose this action if you have no active workers.

#### 4. Take a Leader Card  
- Activate a number of workers equal to the number of leaders **already taken this century**.  
- Take one available Leader card and place it in front of you.  
- You may take only **one leader per century**.  
- Leaders remain in effect until end of century.

**Leader Effects:**  
- **Religious (Purple):** Do the additional action when contributing to a building **you started**.  
- **Political (Red):** When you complete a building, send **all your workers** from it to **one corner zone** (not Citadelle).  
- **Economic (Yellow):** Gain the neutral architect. It functions like your own. At end of century, any building started by neutral architect is **automatically completed**.  
- **Cultural (Blue):** Score bonus VPs when placing ★ tokens:  
  - 2–3 players: 1★ = 1 VP, 2★ = 2 VP, 3★ = 3 VP  
  - 4–5 players: 1★ = 2 VP, 2★ = 3 VP, 3★ = 4 VP  
- **Leader of the Citadelle:** Immediately place 3 passive workers into the Citadelle.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### End of Century Trigger  
Century ends immediately when:  
1. A player has **0 workers** (active or passive) at the start of their turn, **or**  
2. A player chooses “Start a new building” and **no buildings are available** in the current century.

#### End of Century Procedure  
a. **Economic Leader Owner:** Complete the neutral architect’s building (move workers, flip tile, place ★).  
b. Return all Leader cards and the neutral architect to beside the board.  
c. **Score all 5 zones of power** (see below).  
d. Flip all **unoccupied** tiles of the completed century (with blue discs). Tiles with pieces stay as-is.  
e. Move blue discs to the 11 buildings of the **next century**.  
f. Reveal the next Event card. Discard previous. **Exception:** 1608 event stays until scored or game end.  
g. If century ended via “Start a new building” (not neutral), the triggering player **finishes their turn** (places architect, activates workers).  

**Note:** Players **keep all active workers** after scoring.

#### Scoring Zones of Power (Complete Rules)  
Score zones in order:  
1. **Citadel**  
2. **Most influential zone of the century** (1608: Religion, 1708: Politics, 1808: Economy, 1908: Culture)  
3. Continue **clockwise** around the board.

For each zone:  
- Each worker = 1 VP.  
- Player(s) with **majority** (most workers) **cascade** half their workers (rounded down, max 5) to the **next zone**.  
- In case of tie for majority, **all tied players cascade**.  
- After scoring, return non-cascaded workers to supply.  

**Final zone (5th):** Majority player(s) cascade half (rounded down, max 5) onto their **Hand tile** (become active workers).  

**Event Restrictions:**  
- Some events (e.g., *Summit of the Americas*) restrict cascading. If majority player cannot cascade, **no one cascades**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after the **4th century**.  
- No ★ tokens are placed on buildings with architects at game end. These buildings remain with workers.  
- First, perform a **regular end-of-century scoring**, including:  
  - Completing neutral architect’s building (if Economic leader held)  
  - Scoring zones  
  - **But skip steps d–g** (no next century).  

Then, perform **Final Scoring**:  
a. **+1 VP** per worker on **incomplete buildings** (not completed by you).  
b. **+1 VP** per **multiple of 2** active workers on Hand tile (e.g., 4 workers = 2 VP).  
c. **Main Group Scoring:**  
   - Identify your **main group**: the largest **adjacent group** of your ★-marked buildings.  
   - Score: 1★ = 1 VP, 2★ = 3 VP, 3★ = 6 VP.  
   - All **other buildings** (not in main group): **1 VP per ★**.  
d. If the **1608 event** has not been scored, score it now.

**Winning:** Most VPs wins. Tie = shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I contribute to my own building?** Yes, but you **do not** get the additional action.  
- **What if I have no workers when taking a leader?** You still activate workers based on leaders taken, even if supply is empty.  
- **Can I use Rich District action to start with neutral architect?** Yes. You activate 3 workers normally.  
- **When does a 3★ building trigger?** When **three contributions** (by any players) are placed.  
- **Can I cascade into an empty zone?** Yes, unless restricted by an event (e.g., *Summit of the Americas*).  
- **2-player neutral architect:** The last contributor (rightmost) claims the ★ token when building is completed.  
- **Economic Leader in 2-player:** Instead of gaining a second architect, you immediately make the next contribution on the neutral building (using passive workers). No additional action.
