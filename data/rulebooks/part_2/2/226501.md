## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Dragonfire is a cooperative deck-building adventure game where players take on fantasy roles (e.g., Fighter, Wizard, Cleric, Rogue) to complete Adventures by defeating Encounters. The objective is to complete all Scenes within an Adventure by defeating all Encounters in each Scene. Victory is achieved when all Scenes are completed. The game ends in defeat if all players become Unconscious before finishing the Adventure.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### HP = 0: Stunned vs. Unconscious  
- **Stunned**:  
  - Trigger: HP reduced to 0 and not already Exhausted.  
  - Effects:  
    - Gain Exhausted token.  
    - Shuffle hand and discard pile into draw deck.  
    - Cannot use Features or buy from Market.  
    - Next damage reduces to Unconscious.  
    - Healed (any amount) → draw 2 cards, remove Stunned status.  
- **Unconscious**:  
  - Trigger: HP reduced to 0 while already Exhausted.  
  - Effects:  
    - No longer active in Scene until next Short Rest.  
    - Shuffle hand and discard into draw deck.  
    - Rotate all facing Encounters to the left (to next active player at same Location).  
      - If alone at Location → discard Location (no gold).  
    - If all of a Class Type are Unconscious → assign incoming class-specific effects to random non-Unconscious PC.  

#### Skill Checks  
- Reveal top card of draw deck.  
- If card color matches:  
  - Primary Class → Success  
  - Multi-Class → Success if matches either  
  - (Class Type) Skill Check → must match that color  
- Otherwise → Failure  
- Bury (place on bottom of) check card after use.  
- Automatic success/failure → no card revealed.  

#### Encounter Saves  
- Reveal top card of designated Encounter Deck.  
- If color matches Encounter’s color → Success.  
- Otherwise → Failure.  
- Bury save card after use.  
- Save+X → draw X additional save cards after first.  

#### Locations  
- Cards played only affect characters/Encounters at your current Location.  
- Assists: Only to players at same Location or Adventure Environment.  
- Non-damage effects (text-only cards) may apply across Locations unless restricted.  
- Damage icons (top-left) only apply to Encounters at your Location.  
- At end of turn, if in a Location with Attack Strength → take damage from it.  

#### Dragonfire Level  
- Equal to number of cards in Dragonfire Discard pile.  
- Starts at -2 in 2-player games (no Dragonfire card revealed for first two rounds).  
- Some effects trigger "if Dragonfire Level ≥ X".  

#### Sword Icon Rule (Martial Class)  
- If a Martial player plays cards and/or activates Features with a total of 3 or more Sword icons in one turn → immediately draw 1 card.  
- Includes Assists used during other players’ turns.  

#### Gold Distribution  
- When defeating an Encounter:  
  - Killer receives value based on player count (e.g., 3 gold in 5-player game).  
  - All other players receive smaller share (e.g., 2 gold).  
- If Encounter defeats itself, still pays out.  
- If defeating another player’s Encounter, you get the kill gold.  
- If defeated when not anyone’s turn → treat next player as active for gold distribution.  

#### Assists  
- Some cards have "Assist" abilities.  
- Can be used during another player’s **Play Cards** phase.  
- Follow all targeting and effect rules as if played normally.
