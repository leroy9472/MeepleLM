## BANANAGRAMS — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The objective of Bananagrams is to be the first player to use all of their letter tiles to create a personal crossword-style grid of valid words. The game emphasizes speed, vocabulary, and spatial reasoning. The first player to complete their grid and call “BANANAGRAMS!” wins the round.

2. Components  
- 144 letter tiles  
- Cloth storage pouch (not essential for rules, but typically included)

3. Setup  
- Place all 144 tiles face down in the center of the playing area (called the "bunch").  
- Each player draws the following number of tiles from the bunch:  
  - 2–4 players: 21 tiles each  
  - 5–6 players: 15 tiles each  
  - 7 or more players: 11 tiles each  
- Keep tiles hidden from other players until "Split" is called.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. One player says “SPLIT!”  
   - All players simultaneously flip over their tiles and begin forming a personal crossword grid using all their letters.  
   - Words must read left to right (horizontal) or top to bottom (vertical).  
   - All words must interconnect in a single crossword-style grid.  
   - Players may rearrange their grid at any time.  
2. When a player uses all their current tiles:  
   - They say “PEEL!”  
   - They take one tile from the bunch.  
   - Every other player must also take one tile from the bunch and add it to their pool.  
3. At any time, a player may say “DUMP!” to:  
   - Return one tile to the bunch.  
   - Draw three new tiles in exchange.  
4. Continue playing as above until the bunch has fewer tiles than the number of active players.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Simultaneous play: All players play at the same time, without taking turns.  
- Personal grids: Each player builds their own word grid; players do not share or interfere with others’ grids.  
- Word validity: All words must be valid dictionary words (proper nouns and abbreviations typically excluded; house rules may vary).  
- Grid connectivity: All words must be connected in a single, fully interconnected crossword structure.  
- Tile management: Players reduce their tile count through word formation, but gain tiles via "Peel" and "Dump" actions.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when there are fewer tiles remaining in the bunch than active players.  
- The first player to use all their tiles at this point calls “BANANAGRAMS!” to win the round.  
- Verification phase:  
  - Other players may inspect the winner’s grid.  
  - If any word is misspelled or invalid, the winner is disqualified.  
  - The disqualified player returns all their tiles to the bunch and is out of the round.  
  - Remaining players continue playing until one validly uses all their tiles.  
- Winning the game:  
  - A single round ends with one valid winner.  
  - For extended play, players may agree to play a best-of series (e.g., best of 3 or 5 rounds).

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: What happens if multiple players finish at the same time?  
  A: The first to call “BANANAGRAMS!” wins. If disputed, all players continue until one clearly finishes.  
- Q: Can I use the same word twice?  
  A: Generally not recommended; duplicate words may be considered invalid depending on house rules.  
- Q: Can I rearrange my entire grid during play?  
  A: Yes. Players may tear down and rebuild their grid at any time.  
- Q: What if the bunch runs out of tiles during a "Peel"?  
  A: "Peel" can only occur if at least one tile remains. Once the bunch has fewer tiles than players, no more peels occur.  
- Q: Can I dump more than once?  
  A: Yes. A player may "Dump" any number of times during the game.
