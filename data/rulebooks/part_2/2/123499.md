## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the fantasy world of *City of Iron*, four emerging nations—City-State of Arc, Scholars of Cresaria, Hog Republic, and Toad Inventors of Om—compete to grow their influence through technological advancement, territorial expansion, and economic dominance. The age of steam and magic converges as players build cities, conquer towns, and control rare goods.  

**Objective**: Over 7 rounds, players earn Victory Points (VP) by leading in resource production, constructing buildings, conquering towns, and achieving end-game bonuses. The player with the most VP at the end of the game wins. Ties are broken first by most coins, then by most buildings.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Two Decks**: Each player manages separate Citizen and Military decks  
- **Deck Management**:  
  - No shuffling; when draw deck empty, flip discard pile to form new draw deck  
  - Discard piles always face-up; order can be set when discarding  
- **Free Actions**: Cards with clock symbol may be played **before** your normal action, any number  
- **Science Cost**: Only pay once per building type; repeat builds cost 0 science  
- **Population & Cities**:  
  - Each city/district token provides building slots and card draws  
  - Expand city: use Mayor card + pay Hammer → add District token  
  - Settle new city: use Explorer + pay Distance → claim land, place City token  
  - Some lands require Ship or Airship card (can use same card for both Distance and status)  
- **Land Types**: Buildings require specific terrain (e.g., Mine → Mountain)  
- **Towns**:  
  - Provide income, goods, no population cost  
  - Can be stolen; defense value unchanged when owned  
  - Eye symbols allow skipping town cards

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use the same card for Action and Skill?**  
  No. A card is either used for its action or for its skill symbols, not both.  

- **Can I rearrange discard pile order?**  
  Only when discarding: you may arrange the order as you wish. Once discarded, order is fixed until flipped to draw deck.  

- **What happens if I run out of cards to draw?**  
  Flip discard pile to form draw deck. If no cards in either pile, you cannot draw.  

- **Can I build a stored building later?**  
  Yes, during a Build action, you may build from your stored cards.  

- **Do I pay science for same-named building again?**  
  No. Science cost is paid only once per building type.  

- **Can I attack a town I already own?**  
  No. You cannot attack your own town.  

- **What if multiple players tie for most in a resource?**  
  All tied for 1st get full 1st-place VP; all tied for 2nd get full 2nd-place VP.  

- **Can I use a Ship/Airship card for both Distance and status?**  
  Yes.  

- **Do buildings with VP icons score every round?**  
  Yes. Score their VP at every scoring round (3, 5, 7).  

- **Do I collect income before or after scoring?**  
  After scoring. Order: Score → Collect Income → Collect Science → Draw Cards → Buy Cards
