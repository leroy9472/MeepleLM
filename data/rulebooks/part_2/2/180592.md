## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the year 1899, the Temporal Institute for Monument Exploration (TIME) sends steam-powered airships to investigate temporal rifts around ancient monuments like Stonehenge and the Pyramids. These rifts contain rare crystals and distortions in time. As a captain, your goal is to gather resources—crystals, gold, steam, and time—to rise in TIME’s esteem. The player with the highest esteem after 5 rounds wins. In case of a tie, the player with more remaining crystals on their airship board wins.

4. Gameplay Flow (5 Rounds)  
Each round consists of:  
1. **Income Phase** (skip in Round 1)  
2. **Action Phase**  
3. **Supply Phase**

**1. Income Phase (Rounds 2–5 only)**  
Starting with first player, clockwise:  
- Receive income from each upgrade:  
  - Gold: take X gold from bank  
  - Esteem: advance control disc X spaces on esteem track  
  - TIME-crystal: take 1 from secret mine, place in any open generator slot (follow placement rules)  
- Take 1 crystal of depicted color from bag and place in matching generator (if no open slot, skip)  
- Advance steam track disc by 1 (max 10)  
- Take 1 free crystal from any crystal deposit (any monument board), place in matching generator  
  - Do not replace this crystal from bag this round

**2. Action Phase**  
- Starting with first player, proceed clockwise.  
- On your turn, choose one:  
  a) **Take first player tile** (only once per round)  
     - Execute one special action:  
       - Convert 1 steam → 1 esteem (up to 10×)  
       - Convert 1 steam → 1 TIME-crystal (place immediately)  
     - You do not place an airship.  
     - Current round’s first player cannot take tile on first turn.  
     - If no one takes tile and all airships are placed, previous first player takes it and executes one action.  
  b) **Place 1 airship** on any unoccupied action space and execute action.  
     - If unable or unwilling (e.g., no gold, no space), cannot choose.  
- **Placement Rule 6**: If you’ve already placed an airship, next placement must be at least 1 monument board further up the stream of time.  
- Phase ends when all players pass (no more actions) and first player tile is taken.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Crystal Placement Rules**:  
  1. Must go to matching color generator.  
  2. Must go to farthest-left empty slot.  
  3. Slots marked "-2": pay 2 gold when placing (or cannot place).  
  4. TIME-crystals: place immediately upon receipt.  
  5. TIME-crystals always placed to right of colored crystals. New colored crystal shifts TIME-crystal right.  
- **Steam Use**:  
  - Convert to esteem or TIME-crystal via first player action.  
  - Convert any crystal color during upgrade/expedition payment.  
  - Max 10 steam.  
- **Bonuses**:  
  - Triggered by crystal count in matching generator when action space is used.  
  - Only active player receives bonus.  
- **Resource Exhaustion**:  
  - If resource (gold, crystal, TIME-crystal) is unavailable, receive as much as possible.  
  - Cannot receive orange crystal if none left (e.g., from upgrade).

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after Round 5.  
- Reveal missions. Spend required resources to complete.  
  - Only top half of mission counts.  
  - Receive esteem points as shown.  
- Advance on esteem track.  
- Use esteem tiles (60/120) if crossing start space.  
- Highest esteem wins.  
- Tie: most remaining crystals on airship board.  
- Remaining resources (gold, steam, upgrades, expeditions, etc.) have no value.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Orange crystals exhausted?** If an action grants orange crystal but none left, you get nothing.  
- **Resource limits (gold/crystals)?** Receive as much as available.

- **Encounter gives crystals but no space?** Take as many as fit (mind placement rules and costs).  
- **Mr. TIME and bonuses**: Yes, full action and bonus apply.  
- **Rainbow crystal in mission**: Can be fulfilled with TIME-crystal (spent as generator color).  
- **Receiving “any color” crystal**: Cannot take TIME-crystal unless specified.  
- **Placed on top monument board?** Must skip subsequent turns unless taking first player tile.  
- **Multiple rewards (e.g., upgrade)**: Received together; order can be chosen.  
- **Saboteur cost with Mr. TIME?** Yes, must pay 1 TIME-crystal per saboteur.  
- **Specialist use**: Play before action; only top specialist active; refresh hand to 2 at turn end.
