### 1. Lore & Objective
In the 17th century, the Netherlands experienced a "Golden Age" of economic prosperity and innovation in land reclamation. Using windmills, merchants and engineers drained lakes and marshes to create fertile farmland. In *Seeland*, players take on the roles of Dutch land developers competing to reclaim land, build windmills, and cultivate fields. The goal is to earn the most victory points through successful harvests, record yields, and fulfilling civic expectations.

### 2. Components
- Game board (assembled from six parts), showing a landscape with a central starting village and a surrounding market
- 28 mill tiles (values 0–5), front = construction plan, back = completed mill
- 30 landscape tiles (cabbage, rapeseed, tulips; values 0–7), front = seed bag, back = cultivated field
- 30 island tiles, front = uncultivated island, back = landscape or farm
- 12 stuivers (small coins)
- 4 point tiles (per player, used for scoring over 100 points)
- 5 guilder coins (large coins)
- 1 guild master (large black pawn)
- 7 governors (small black pawns)
- 8 record markers (2 per player in colors)
- 16 windmill tokens (4 per player in colors)
- 4 scoring markers (1 per player)
- 4 merchant pawns (1 per player)

### 3. Setup
1. Assemble the board with the blue scoring track (0–100) visible.
2. Place the following face up on the market:
   - 5 landscape tiles on market stalls
   - 3 mill tiles on workshop squares
   - Leave the warehouse empty
3. Shuffle island tiles and place one face down on each island-marked space.
4. Form draw piles:
   - Landscape tiles (seed side up) on designated space
   - Mill tiles (plan side up) on designated space
5. Place:
   - 5 guilder coins on marked trading houses
   - 7 governors in the center of the market
   - Guild master on the workshop space next to his image
   - All scoring markers at 0 on the scoring track
   - Each player’s merchant on the last guilder of the row
6. Each player takes:
   - 4 windmill tokens
   - 1 scoring marker
   - 1 merchant
   - 2 record markers (if playing with variants)
   - 1 stuiver
7. Starting player (last to have visited the Netherlands) places one windmill on any starting village mill space. Others follow clockwise, each placing one windmill on an empty starting space.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn has four possible actions:

#### 1. Purchase
- Move the guild master **at least one space** clockwise around the market.
- If he stops on:
  - **Market stall**: take the landscape tile
  - **Workshop**: take the mill tile
  - **Warehouse (–3)**: skip tile purchase, lose 3 points, and optionally move your merchant **back** up to 3 guilders
- **Payment**: For each space (including warehouse) skipped, move your merchant **one guilder forward**.
  - Cannot move past the foremost guilder.
- **Relocation**: If all merchants pass the last guilder, move the last guilder to the first empty space ahead of the foremost merchant.
- **Replenishment**: After payment, refill the space the guild master previously occupied from the top of the appropriate stack.

#### 2. Land Reclamation (Place Tile)
- **Landscape tile**:
  - Must place adjacent to **one of your own mills**.
  - If you have **no mills on the board**, place adjacent to any developed area (landscape, mill, or farm tile).
- **Mill tile**:
  - Must place adjacent to **any developed area** (landscape, mill, or farm tile).
  - You may place **one of your windmill tokens** on it (making it yours).
  - If you place a mill, immediately **turn over adjacent face-down island tiles**.
    - **Landscape**: treat as normal field
    - **Farm**: gain 1 stuiver immediately
    - **Governor symbol**: take a governor and place it next to your new mill

#### 3. Harvest
- Whenever a mill becomes **completely surrounded** (all adjacent hexes occupied), it harvests immediately.
- **Yield** = mill value + values of all adjacent **landscape tiles**.
- **Monoculture rule**: If the mill borders **0 or only 1 type** of landscape (cabbage, rapeseed, tulips), yield = **0**.
- **Landscape bonus**: If mill borders **all three** landscape types, add **+5 points**.
- **Scoring**: Move scoring marker forward by total yield.
- **Return mill**: Take back your windmill token to use again.
- **Order of harvest**:
  1. The player whose turn it is
  2. Other players’ mills, in clockwise order
- **Optional – Record Harvest**:
  - Use one of your record markers to mark this harvest on the scoring track.
  - Place marker on the number equal to the harvest value.
  - If space occupied, place on next lower unoccupied number.
  - Only two record markers per player; cannot be moved once placed.
- **Governor effect**:
  - If a governor is next to the mill, compare harvest yield to the **golden number** on the trading house in front of the foremost guilder.
  - **Yield ≥ expectation**: gain **+5 points**, claim the governor.
  - **Yield < expectation**: lose **5 points**, and move the governor to the **nearest mill** without a governor (player chooses in case of tie).
  - Governors can move across developed areas only.

#### 4. Spend Stuiver (Optional)
- Spend **1 stuiver** to take an **extra turn** (repeat steps 1–3).
- Only **one extra turn per round** allowed.
- Stuivers are removed from the game when spent.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Tile Placement**:
  - Landscape tiles require adjacency to your mill (unless no mills exist).
  - Mill tiles require adjacency to any developed area.
- **Resource Management**:
  - Movement of the guild master costs "money" (merchant position).
  - Merchant cannot pass the foremost guilder.
  - Warehouse allows recovery of financial flexibility at cost of points.
- **Scoring Triggers**:
  - Harvests occur immediately when a mill is surrounded.
  - Scoring includes mill value, adjacent landscapes, and possible bonus.
- **Dynamic Market**:
  - Guild master movement determines tile access and cost.
  - Tiles are replenished after each purchase.
- **Island Mechanic**:
  - Island tiles are flipped when a mill is placed adjacent.
  - Can reveal landscapes, farms (stuiver), or governors.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game ends** when a player moves the guild master onto an **empty market space** (except warehouse).
  - No harvest occurs after this action.
  - Mills still on the board do not score.
- **Final Scoring**:
  1. **Base Points**: Current position on scoring track.
  2. **Record Harvest Bonuses**:
     - 1st highest record: +20
     - 2nd: +15
     - 3rd: +10
     - 4th: +5
     - Only top four receive bonuses; ties handled by position on track.
  3. **Governor Bonuses**:
     - Lose **5 points per governor** still next to your mills.
     - Player with **most claimed governors** gains **+10 points**.
     - In case of tie, all tied players gain **+5 points**.
- **Winning**: Highest total score wins. Ties result in multiple winners.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Q: What if I move the guild master to the warehouse but have 0 points?**  
  A: You lose no points, and may still move your merchant backward up to 3 guilders.

- **Q: Can I place a landscape tile if I have no mills on the board?**  
  A: Yes, adjacent to any developed area.

- **Q: Can I build a mill on a mill tile if I have no windmill tokens left?**  
  A: No. The mill tile remains unowned.

- **Q: What if placing a tile surrounds multiple mills?**  
  A: Harvest each in order: current player first, then others clockwise.

- **Q: What if a harvest triggers both a record and a governor check?**  
  A: Resolve both. The governor’s ±5 points **does not affect** the value used for the record.

- **Q: What if a governor must move but no mill exists?**  
  A: Return the governor to the box.

- **Q: What if two mills are equally close for a governor move?**  
  A: The current player chooses.

- **Q: What if fewer than four record markers are placed?**  
  A: Only the existing ones compete for available bonus positions.

- **Q: What if my scoring marker passes 100?**  
  A: Continue moving; place your 100-point tile in front of you. Flip to 200 if passing again.
