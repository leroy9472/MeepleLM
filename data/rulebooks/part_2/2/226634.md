## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
**Lore**:  
In *The Thing: Infection at Outpost 31*, players are researchers at a remote Antarctic base in 1982. After a strange alien entity from a buried spacecraft begins assimilating the crew, paranoia spreads. One or more players are secretly Imitations—alien shapeshifters trying to survive by infecting humans, destroying the base, or escaping undetected. The remaining humans must uncover Gear, defeat hidden Things, and escape via helicopter—without letting any Imitations board.

**Victory Conditions**:  
- **Human Victory**:  
  - Successfully escape on the helicopter with only human players aboard, meeting the required number of survivors based on player count.  
  - *Alternative Win*: In 4–6 player games, torch all Imitations before escape.  
- **Imitation Victory**:  
  - Reach maximum Contagion Level.  
  - Destroy 4 rooms (fill Destruction Tracker).  
  - Have at least one Imitation escape on the helicopter.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **No Fire Extinguisher/Flashlight?**  
  - Use Molotov to redraw. Captain may pass turn (skip Smoke/Fire resolution once per game).  
- **Can Imitation sabotage rolls?**  
  - No. Captain must use all rolls and Gear benefits. Cannot refuse Dynamite or Flamethrower boosts.  
- **Pool corrupted?**  
  - Bury entire pool, redraw correct number, reform pool.  
- **Thing in destroyed room?**  
  - Does not count toward Objective Tracker. Must be defeated in Battle.  
- **Too many rooms destroyed?**  
  - If two of same Room Chip type lost in one sector → impossible to win → Imitation Victory.  
- **Multiple Sabotages cause failure?**  
  - Advance Infection Tracker only once per turn.  
- **Leave human behind in 4-player game?**  
  - Imitation Victory (cannot verify all are human).  
- **Unmet department requirement?**  
  - Still proceed; Captain cannot swap cards.  
- **All Imitations torched?**  
  - In 4–6 player games: check Assimilation Deck. If no Imitation cards left → Human Victory.
