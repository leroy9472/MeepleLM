### 3. Setup  
#### Multiplayer (2–6 players):  
1. Place main board in center.  
2. Split tribe cards into **8 decks**: each ape type (Chimpanzee, Gorilla, Mandrill, Orangutan) at levels 1 and 2. Shuffle each deck separately; place on matching spaces on main board.  
3. Create general supply: unlimited flowers, fruits, grains, and energy.  
4. Shuffle object tiles; reveal **3 randomly** next to board.  
   - First game recommended: **Computer, Ghetto Blaster (or Boombox), Moped**.  
5. Each player:  
   - Choose a color.  
   - Place player board in front of them.  
   - Shuffle 8 Tamarin cards; form face-down draw pile to the left.  
   - Place 4 action discs face down on player board.  
   - Place 1 score token on **0** of main board’s score track.  
   - Place 1 rage token on **0** of their player board’s rage track.  

#### Solo Mode (vs. King of the Apes):  
1. Assign a color to the **King of the Apes** (automa).  
2. Set up King’s components:  
   - Player board, 8 Tamarin cards (shuffled draw pile), 2 tokens (score and rage at 0).  
   - Reveal **3 of his 4 action discs** randomly in a row above his board; **return 4th to box**.  
   - Give King **2 resources** matching the attraction cost of the **leftmost revealed disc**:  
     - Mandrill → 2 flowers  
     - Orangutan → 2 fruits  
     - Gorilla → 2 grains  
     - Chimpanzee → 2 of any one food type (based on missing ape)  
   - Shuffle King’s draw pile.  
3. If **Computer** is not among the 3 revealed objects, **give it exclusively to the King**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Frame Activation  
- Resolve rows: **top → center → bottom**  
- Within row: **left to right**  
- **Closed frames only** (inner or edge-closed by adjacent card)  
- Conditions (→):  
  - Cost: pay resources to activate  
  - Requirements: e.g., “3+ ape types” or “# of Tamarins” – no cost, just meet condition  
- **Chimpanzee**: Each 🔄 = activate **one other closed frame** (condition must be met)  

#### Rage  
- Tracked on player board. Gorillas generate rage.  
- Spend **4 rage** to **permanently remove** one card from Primate Assembly.  
  - Card must be in current Assembly  
  - Not replaced; gaps remain  
  - Gain **rage bonus** (top right) immediately  
  - Can trigger mid-resolution  
  - Minimum 4 cards in deck at all times  

#### Objects (Each usable once per round)  
| Object | Phase | Cost | Effect |  
|-------|-------|------|--------|  
| **Computer** | 1, 2, or 3 | 5 energy | Score 5 VP |  
| **Moped** | 2 | 6 (L1) or 9 (L2) energy | Attract any ape (place on draw pile) |  
| **Ghetto Blaster / Boombox** | 1 | 2 energy | Discard 1 drawn card; draw replacement from draw pile |  
| **Minibar** | 1 or 2 | 1 energy | Swap 1 resource with general supply |  
| **Game Console** | 3 | 3 (L1) or 5 (L2) energy | Save 1 discarded card to top of draw pile |  
| **Pinball Machine** | 1 | 4 energy | Draw 5th card this round |  
| **Mobile Phone** | 1 | 2 (L1) or 3 (L2) energy | Return 1 drawn card to deck; draw replacement from any deck (same level) |

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Score VP via:  
  - Frame effects (center/bottom rows)  
  - Mandrills (high VP potential)  
  - Computer (5 VP)  
  - Removing cards with rage (rage bonus may include VP)  
  - King’s level 1/2 apes (3/6 VP each when revealed)  
- **Game ends** when **any player reaches 80+ VP** at the end of a phase.  
  - If during **P1**, game ends **immediately**  
- **Solo mode**: You win only if you reach 80 VP **before or when** the King does.  
- **Tie at 80+**: highest total VP wins; if still tied, **shared victory**  
- **Premature end**: If not enough cards to satisfy all attractions, game ends after current round.  
  - **Priority**: player with **highest ID number** in Primate Assembly chooses first, then next highest, etc.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I skip frames?** Yes. You may skip any frame, even if activatable.  
- **Can Chimpanzee activate same frame twice?** Yes, as long as it’s closed and condition met.  
- **Can I remove a card not in current Assembly?** No. Only cards in current Primate Assembly.  
- **Do rage bonuses stack for Chimpanzees?** Yes. Each Chimpanzee gives **all** Tamarin rage bonuses from that round.  
- **What if King lacks resources I need?** Take from general supply.  
- **Can I use object effects in solo mode?** Yes, same as multiplayer. King only uses **Computer** (if not in general pool).  
- **Can I copy King’s disc if I can’t attract ape?** Yes. Copying only gives bonus, not attraction right.
