## PIT — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
PIT is a fast-paced, real-time card trading game for 3 to 13 players. The objective is to be the first player to accumulate 25 points (or a pre-agreed target) by winning rounds. A round is won by being the first to collect a complete set (family) of nine cards of the same rank.

### 2. Components  
- One bell (or audible signal device)  
- 72–81 standard playing cards (three decks combined):  
  - Two full decks  
  - One additional suit added (total nine cards per rank)  
- Game rules  

Note: The version described includes cow-themed cards in one source, but the core mechanics align with the standard Pit card game using ranks.

### 3. Setup  
1. Choose the appropriate ranks based on player count:  
   - 3 players: 9, 10, Ace  
   - 4 players: 9, 10, Jack, Ace  
   - 5 players: 9, 10, Jack, Queen, Ace  
   - 6 players: 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace  
   - 7 players: 8 through Ace  
   - 8 players: 7 through Ace  
   - 9 players: 6 through Ace  
   - 10 players: 5 through Ace  
   - 11 players: 4 through Ace  
   - 12 players: 3 through Ace  
   - 13 players: 2 through Ace  
2. Remove unused ranks and combine remaining cards into a single deck.  
3. Shuffle thoroughly.  
4. Deal 9 cards to each player.  
5. Place the bell within easy reach of all players.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. All players organize hands silently.  
2. One player calls “GO!” to begin.  
3. Simultaneous trading begins:  
   - Players may trade cards only in groups of 1–4.  
   - All traded cards must be of the same rank.  
   - Must trade equal number of cards (e.g., 2 for 2).  
   - Cannot reveal the rank being traded.  
   - Only announcement allowed: number of cards (e.g., “Three! Three! Three!”).  
4. Trading continues until one player collects nine cards of one rank.  
5. That player rings the bell immediately.  
6. All trading stops.  
7. Round ends; points are awarded.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Trading Rules**:  
  - Only same-rank cards can be traded.  
  - Must trade equal numbers.  
  - No non-verbal signals unless playing a variant.  
  - Players must always hold exactly 9 cards.  
- **Win Condition**: First to complete a set of 9 identical ranks.  
- **Variants (Optional)**:  
  - **Silent Cow**: Use fingers only to indicate number.  
  - **Spanish Cow**: Say numbers in Spanish (uno, dos, etc.).  
  - **Mad Cow Disease**: Say “Moo” repeated (e.g., “Moo, Moo” for two).  
  - **Pets**: Say animal names (duck, cat, dog, sheep).  
  - **Animal Sounds**: Make animal sounds instead of words.  
  - **Sow Cow**: Say “Grouik” repeated.  
  - **Aperitif Cow**: Call drinks (coffee, beer, tequila, champagne).  
  - **Einstein Cow**: Reverse numbers (1→4, 2→3, 3→2, 4→1).  
  - **Happy Cow**: Say “Hip!” or “Hooray!” repeated.  
  - **Cow ‘n Guns**: Use sound effects (Clic, Bang, Boom).  
  - **Angry Cow**: Use exclamations (Darn!, Damn!, Blow!, Bug!).  
  - **La Vache Qui Rit**: Laugh types (Ha ha ha, Hi hi hi, etc.).  
  - **Belgian-Mexican Cow**: Say food items (mussels, fries, tacos, nachos).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Scoring per round**:  
  - Nine Aces = 11 points  
  - Nine 10s, Jacks, Queens, Kings = 10 points  
  - Nine of any other rank = 9 points  
- Play continues until one player reaches 25 points.  
- If no one reaches 25 in 8 rounds (as per one version), highest score wins.  
- Optional: Play to 200 points (cow-themed version), but standard is 25.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Tie in trading calls?** First complete valid trade wins; no penalty for miscommunication.  
- **Incorrect trade?** If discovered after trade, it stands — game is fast and chaotic.  
- **Bell rings prematurely?** If player doesn’t have 9 of a kind, no points awarded; round continues.  
- **Can you trade with multiple players at once?** No — trades are one-on-one only.  
- **What if no one completes a set?** Game continues until someone does — no time limit.  
- **Silent round above 100 points?** Suggested in cow version, but not standard rule. Ignore unless house rule.
