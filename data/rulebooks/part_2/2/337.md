## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Your aim is to collect the best-scoring hand of Circus cards by the end of the game. Points are scored in three ways:  
- By holding the highest-value card in each color (only one per color counts).  
- By forming Trios (three cards of the same value, regardless of color), each worth 10 points.  
- By being the only player to call a Gala Show (having one card of each of the ten colors), earning a 10-point bonus and ending the game immediately.

2. Components  
- 80 Circus cards: 10 colors (each representing a circus act), 8 cards per color numbered 0–7.  
- 9 Action cards: 3 copies each of 3 types:  
  - **Mind Reader (or "Take a card")**: Choose a player; they give you a card of their choice from their hand.  
  - **Magic Eye (or "Pick a card")**: Choose a player; take a random card from their hand.  
  - **Great Parade (or "Open the deck" / "Searching for a Memory")**: Reveal cards from the deck until a duplicate color appears; discard the duplicate, then take any card from the display.

3. Setup  
1. Shuffle all 80 Circus cards and 9 Action cards together into one deck. Place the deck face-down in the center.  
2. Reveal the top card and place it face-up beside the deck to start the Circus display.  
3. Leave space for a discard pile.  
4. The youngest player goes first. Play proceeds clockwise.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn:  
1. **Reveal Phase (optional)**:  
   - If the display is empty or you don’t want any displayed cards, reveal the top card of the deck.  
   - You may continue revealing one card at a time.  
   - If the revealed card matches the color of any card already in the display, place it on the discard pile and **end your turn immediately**. You cannot take a card or perform actions.  
   - If you reveal an Action card, follow its instructions (see below), then discard it. After resolving, you may Form a Trio or Call a Gala Show before ending your turn.  
   - If you reveal another Action card during an ongoing Action (e.g., during "Great Parade"), the new Action replaces the current one. Follow it immediately and end your turn after resolving it.  
   - If you reveal the last card from the deck and it causes a duplicate color or ends a chain, the game ends after resolving the turn.  

2. **Take Phase**:  
   - At any point before revealing a duplicate color, you may stop and take **one** card from the display into your hand.  
   - After taking a card, your turn continues to the action phase.  

3. **Action Phase (before turn ends)**:  
   - You may **Form a Trio** (if you have three cards of the same number).  
   - You may **Call a Gala Show** (if you have at least one card of each of the ten colors).  
   - After either or both, your turn ends.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Display Rules**: The display starts with one card and grows as players reveal. Cards remain face-up until taken or discarded.  
- **Duplicate Color Rule**: Revealing a color already in the display ends your turn immediately. The new card is discarded.  
- **Action Cards**:  
  - Must be resolved immediately when revealed.  
  - After resolution, the Action card is discarded.  
  - You may still Form a Trio or Call a Gala Show after resolving an Action card.  
  - If the last card drawn during an Action is the final deck card, the game ends immediately after resolution.  
- **Form a Trio**:  
  - Any time during your turn (after taking a card), if you have three cards of the same value (e.g., three #4s), place them face-up in front of you.  
  - You may form multiple Trios at once if eligible.  
  - Cards in Trios no longer count toward hand scoring or Gala Show eligibility.  
- **Call a Gala Show**:  
  - Only possible if you hold at least one card of each of the ten colors.  
  - You may only do this at the end of your turn, after taking a card.  
  - Announce the Gala Show, reveal your hand to confirm, then the game ends immediately.  
  - You score a 10-point bonus.

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends in one of two ways:  
1. A player calls a **Gala Show** (immediate end).  
2. The **last card is drawn** from the deck. The current player finishes their turn normally, then the game ends.  

Final scoring:  
- **Circus Cards**: For each color in your hand, score only the highest-numbered card. Lower cards of the same color score nothing.  
- **Trios**: Each set of three cards of the same value placed in front of you scores 10 points.  
- **Gala Show Bonus**: Only the player who called the Gala Show scores 10 bonus points.  

Total all three categories. Highest score wins.  
Tie: Players with the highest score share victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I form a Trio using a card I just took?**  
  Yes. The card taken during your turn can be part of a Trio.  
- **Can I form multiple Trios in one turn?**  
  Yes, as long as you have the sets.  
- **What happens if I reveal the last card and it's a duplicate?**  
  Discard it and end your turn. The game ends after your turn.  
- **What if I reveal the last card and it's an Action card?**  
  Resolve the Action normally. After resolution, the game ends.  
- **Can I call a Gala Show after resolving an Action card?**  
  Yes, as long as you have one of each color.  
- **Do Trio cards count toward a Gala Show?**  
  No. Only cards in your hand count.  
- **What if I call a Gala Show but don’t actually have all ten colors?**  
  In the Japanese edition ("Perfect Summer"), you must show your hand. If invalid, you pick up your hand and play continues.  
- **Can I reveal cards even if the display has cards I could take?**  
  Yes, but you risk ending your turn with no gain.
