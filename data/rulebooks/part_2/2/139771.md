### 1. Lore & Objective
Star Trek: Attack Wing is a tactical starship combat game set in the Star Trek universe. Players command fleets representing factions such as the Federation, Klingon Empire, and Romulan Star Empire, engaging in space battles using maneuver dials, custom dice, and upgrade cards. The standard objective is to destroy all enemy ships. However, many missions provide alternate victory conditions involving objectives, survival, or narrative goals. Special scenarios emphasize diplomacy, tactics, or combat dominance depending on faction and mission context.

### 2. Components
- Painted plastic ships with bases and pegs  
- Ship Tokens and Captain ID Tokens  
- HeroClix™ Maneuver Dials and Maneuver Templates (Straights, Banks, Turns, Come About, Full Astern)  
- Action Tokens: Evade, Battle Stations, Scan, Cloak, Target Lock (red/blue), Auxiliary Power  
- Shield Tokens (double-sided: active blue / disabled red)  
- Critical Hit Tokens  
- Disabled Upgrade Tokens  
- Minefield Token, Planet Token, Objective Tokens, Mission Tokens  
- Ship Cards, Captain Cards, Upgrade Cards (Crew, Weapon, Tech, Elite Talent)  
- Damage Cards (face up for criticals, face down for regular damage)  
- 5 red Attack Dice, 5 green Defense Dice  
- Range Ruler (measures Range 1–3)  

### 3. Setup
1. **Choose Faction(s)**: Players agree on factions (Federation, Klingon, Romulan, etc.). In squad building, players may mix factions with penalties.  
2. **Gather Forces**: Choose Ship, Captain, and Upgrade Cards within a point limit (standard: 80–100 Squadron Points per player). Each ship must have exactly one Captain Card.  
3. **Assemble Ships**: Attach Ship Token and Captain ID Tokens to base; assemble maneuver dial.  
4. **Establish Play Area**: Use a flat surface (minimum 3'×3'). For 2 players, place ships within Range 1 of starting edges. For 3 players, use designated 4"×8" starting areas.  
5. **Place Forces**: Ships are placed in ascending order of Captain Skill. Ties are broken by Faction Initiative (Federation > Klingon > Romulan > others).  
6. **Prepare Cards and Tokens**: Place Ship, Captain, and Upgrade Cards face up. Shuffle Damage Deck. Place Shield Tokens equal to Ship’s Shield Value (active side up).  
7. **Add Mission Elements**: If playing a mission, place Planet, Objective, or Mission Tokens as specified.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round consists of four phases:
1. **Planning Phase**: Players secretly assign maneuvers using Maneuver Dials.  
2. **Activation Phase**: Ships activate in ascending order of Captain Skill. For each:
   - Reveal maneuver dial.
   - Execute maneuver using matching template.
   - Check for Auxiliary Power (Red Maneuver = gain token; Green = remove one).
   - Perform one Action (if no Auxiliary Power Token).
3. **Combat Phase**: Ships attack in descending order of Captain Skill. Each may make one attack:
   - Declare target within firing arc and range.
   - Roll Attack Dice (Primary Weapon or Secondary Weapon value).
   - Modify attack dice (e.g., Target Lock, Battle Stations).
   - Defender rolls Defense Dice (Agility + modifiers).
   - Modify defense dice (e.g., Evade, Battle Stations).
   - Compare results: cancel hits, apply remaining damage.
   - Deal damage: remove shields or assign Damage Cards.
4. **End Phase**: 
   - Flip disabled shields back to active.
   - Remove unused Evade, Scan, Battle Stations, and red Cloak tokens.
   - Green Cloak tokens may be retained if shields stay disabled.
   - Unused Target Locks remain.
   - Resolve end-phase abilities.

Repeat until victory condition is met.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Firing Arcs**: Forward wedge defines primary attack arc. Some ships have rear arcs for specific weapons.  
- **Range**: Measured with Range Ruler (1, 2, or 3). Primary weapons hit at Range 1–3.  
- **Combat Bonuses**:
  - Attacker gains +1 Attack Die at Range 1.
  - Defender gains +1 Defense Die at Range 3.
- **Actions**:
  - **Evasive Maneuvers**: Gain token to add 1 evade result later.
  - **Scan**: Target rolls 1 less defense die.
  - **Battle Stations**: Convert all [B] results to [C] when attacking or defending.
  - **Cloak**: Disable all shields, place green Cloak token. Gain +4 Defense Dice. Cannot fire without flipping token to red (removed in End Phase).
  - **Sensor Echo**: Cloaked ship slides left/right 1 or 2.
  - **Target Lock**: Place red token on target, blue on self. Spend to reroll attack dice.
  - **Auxiliary Power**: Gained by executing Red Maneuvers. Prevents Actions and Red maneuvers until removed via Green maneuver.
- **Damage**:
  - Each [+] result = 1 damage.
  - Each [++] result = 1 critical damage (face-up Damage Card).
  - Active Shields absorb damage; once depleted, damage becomes Damage Cards.
  - Hull destroyed when Damage Cards ≥ Hull Value.
- **Movement Rules**:
  - **Overlap**: If base overlaps another ship, move backward until touching. Skip Action.
  - **Obstacles**: If maneuver overlaps obstacle, roll 1 Attack Die; suffer damage/crit.
  - **Planet Token**: Cannot overlap; move backward along template if contact occurs.
- **Special Rules**:
  - **Cloaking**: Ships may remain cloaked across turns by keeping shields disabled.
  - **Simultaneous Attack Rule**: Ships with same Captain Skill can attack before destruction.
  - **Unique Cards**: Only one copy per team. Unique cards destroyed if ship is destroyed or sacrificed.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Standard Win**: Last player with surviving ships wins.
- **Mission Objectives**: Victory determined by mission-specific goals (e.g., escaping with tokens, destroying objectives, surviving).
- **Battle Points (in some missions)**:
  - +1 for each enemy ship destroyed.
  - +1 for each of your operational ships at game end.
- **Tiebreakers**:
  - Simultaneous destruction: player whose ship had initiative wins.
  - Mission ties: Priority Objectives (Tactical, Diplomatic, Combat) break ties based on faction or random assignment.
- **Game End Triggers**:
  - All enemy ships destroyed.
  - Mission objective completed.
  - Random end condition (e.g., die roll in "8+ Rounds" games).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you Target Lock a cloaked ship?**  
  Yes, if it cloaked this turn (token on base). No, if it has been cloaked since previous turn (token beside base).
- **What happens if a ship has an Auxiliary Power Token and attempts a Red Maneuver?**  
  Opponent chooses a non-Red maneuver from the ship’s dial.
- **Can a ship perform multiple Actions?**  
  Only one per turn unless granted a "Free Action" by an ability (e.g., Temporal Distortion).
- **Do disabled shields protect the hull?**  
  No. Disabled (red) shields do not absorb damage; only active (blue) shields do.
- **Can you use Upgrade abilities after being hit?**  
  Yes, unless the Damage Card specifies otherwise.
- **What happens when a ship moves through a cloaked enemy?**  
  No penalty. Movement is allowed through other ships.
- **Can you perform a Sensor Echo after overlapping another ship?**  
  No. Sensor Echo cannot be performed if it would cause overlap.
- **Can you cloak with no shields?**  
  No. Must have at least 1 Active Shield to perform Cloak action.
