## MARE NOSTRUM (WITH MYTHOLOGY EXPANSION) — COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE MANUAL

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Mare Nostrum is a strategy board game set in the ancient Mediterranean world, where players lead powerful civilizations—such as Rome, Egypt, Babylon, Greece, and Atlantis—in a race to dominate through economic strength, military might, construction, and divine favor. The goal is to achieve one of two victory conditions: constructing The Pyramids or controlling a combined total of four Heroes and/or Wonders.

With the Mythology Expansion, players gain access to gods, heroes, and mythical creatures, adding layers of tactical depth and thematic richness.

**Victory Conditions (Standard Game):**  
- Build The Pyramids.  
- Control a combined total of 4 Hero and/or Wonder cards.  

*(Optional longer game: 5 total Heroes/Wonders; The Pyramids cost 13 Resource cards to build.)*

### 3. Setup  

#### Base Setup  
1. Connect the expansion board to the western edge of the main board.  
2. Shuffle Hero and Wonder cards together; randomly remove 8 cards from play (do not reveal).  
3. Sort all Resource cards and place them faceup beside the board as a shared bank.  
4. Each player selects:  
   - A civilization  
   - Corresponding player aid, Hero cards, Role card (if applicable), wooden pieces  
5. Place building tokens (Cities, Temples, Markets, Caravans, Fortresses) beside the board for easy access.

#### Neutral Civilizations (for fewer than 6 players)  
- **4 players**: Remove Babylon. Create neutral civilizations by placing in each neutral capital:  
  - 1 Influence marker  
  - 1 Creature  
  - 1 Legion  
  - 1 Fortress  
  Then place in each adjacent province:  
  - 1 Influence marker  
  - 1 Legion  
  - 1 Fortress  
- **3 players**: Remove Rome and Egypt; apply same neutral setup.

#### Advanced Setup (Alternative)  
Each player starts with **45 Construction points** to spend on:  
- Influence markers  
- Buildings (Cities, Temples, Markets, Caravans)  
- Military units (Legions, Triremes, Fortresses)  
- One starting Hero (not General Heroes or Wonders)  

Costs = number of Resource cards required to purchase in-game.

**Procedure:**  
1. Randomly determine build order.  
2. Players take turns placing **9 points worth of components**, repeating for **5 rounds** (total 45 points).  
3. All placements restricted to:  
   - Player’s Capital Province  
   - Provinces immediately adjacent to capital  
4. Must place at least **1 Influence marker** in own capital.  
5. Legions and Triremes must begin in capital.  
6. Greek player may settle in Aegean provinces: Constantinopolis, Troas, Rhodus, Cnossus.  
7. Atlanteon player may settle in westernmost European and African provinces.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players proceed through **four phases per turn**, in this order:  
1. **Commerce Phase**  
2. **Offering to the Gods Phase**  
3. **Construction Phase**  
4. **Military Phase**  

Within each phase, turn order is determined by the current **Role card holder**. Roles are reassessed at the start of each phase.

#### Role Determination  
- **Director of Commerce**: Most Caravans + Markets in controlled provinces  
- **High Priest**: Most Temples + Markets  
- **Political Leader**: Most Cities + Temples  
- **Military Leader**: Most deployed military units (Legions, Triremes, Fortresses)  

**Tie Rules:**  
- Current role holder keeps the card.  
- If two others tie, current holder chooses who gets it.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### 1. Commerce Phase  
**a. Collect Revenues**  
For each:  
- **City** under influence or occupied by Legion:  
  - 1 Tax card  
  - +1 extra (total 2) if Temple in same province  
- **Caravan** under influence or occupied by Legion:  
  - 1 Commodity card per resource icon  
  - +1 extra (total 2) if Market in same province  

**Occupation Requirements:**  
- To gain Temple bonus: Legion must occupy the Temple.  
- To gain Market bonus: Legion must occupy the Market.  
- Buildings being converted produce income for original owner until conversion is complete.

**b. Trading Between Players**  
1. **Director of Commerce** chooses how many Resource cards (Taxes or Commodities) each player must offer (0 up to own hand size).  
2. Each player selects that number of cards and places them facedown.  
3. All offered cards revealed simultaneously.  
4. Trading proceeds:  
   - Director picks first card from any other player.  
   - That player then picks from another (not the one who just took from them, unless only two involved).  
   - Continue until all cards taken.  
   - No player may take back a facedown card.  
   - No more than **2 consecutive trades** between same pair.  
5. Final resolution:  
   - When last card taken, the player missing a card receives one from Director’s hand or facedown pile.  
   - All players take their new cards into hand.

#### 2. Offering to the Gods Phase  
- **High Priest** sets turn order.  
- On a player’s turn, may spend **3 Resource cards (any combination)** to invoke a God.  
- Take chosen **God card** and place it faceup in front of you.  
- God remains active until **start of next Offering phase**, when all are returned.  
- **God powers** can be activated **at any time** while held faceup; apply effect immediately, then turn card **facedown** (cannot reuse until next Offering phase).

---

#### 3. Construction Phase  
- **Political Leader** sets turn order.  
- On turn, spend **Resource card sets** to:  
  - Purchase Heroes  
  - Construct Buildings or Military units  
  - Place Influence markers  

**Valid Sets:**  
- All **Tax cards only**, OR  
- All **non-matching Commodity cards only**  
- Value of set = number of cards in it  

**Discard Rules:**  
- Unused cards and used sets discarded to bank at end of phase.  
- Each player may keep **up to 2 Tax cards**.

**Construction Rules:**  
- Buildings and military units can only be built in provinces with **player’s Influence marker**.  
- Influence markers can only be placed in provinces:  
  - Adjacent to a province controlled **at start of turn**  
  - Not under another player’s influence  
- During turn Influence marker is placed, **no other construction** in that province.  
- Limits per province:  
  - 1 City per site  
  - 1 Caravan per resource  
  - 1 Temple, Market, or Fortress per province

- **Reductions** (e.g., cost discounts) are **not cumulative**.

---

#### 4. Military Phase  
- **Military Leader** sets turn order.  
- On turn, move units and resolve combat.  

**Order of Resolution:**  
1. All **naval movement and combat**  
2. All **ground movement and combat**  
- May alternate moves, but **naval must finish before ground begins**.

**Movement Rules:**  
- **Naval Movement**: Triremes move to adjacent sea space.  
- **Naval Battles (Optional)**: Attacker may choose to fight when entering occupied sea space. Must resolve **before** moving Legions.  
- **Legion Movement**: Legions and Creatures move to adjacent land province, or via chain of **friendly triremes** across sea.  
- **Ground Battles (Obligatory)**: Must fight when entering province with opposing Legions or Fortresses.

**Combat Rules:**  
- All battles last **one round only**.  
- **Unit Types:**  
  - Ground units (Legions, Creatures, Fortresses) fight only ground units  
  - Naval units (Triremes) fight only naval units  
- **Fortresses**: Automatically "roll" a 6. Cannot move. Must be destroyed before province can be sacked/occupied/converted.  
- **Creatures**: Automatically "roll" a 6. Max 3 per player.  
- **Rolling**: Each player rolls one die per unit (Legion or Trireme).  
- Total all dice + any bonuses.  
- Opponent removes **1 unit per 5 points** of total (owning player chooses which).  

**Aftermath – Surviving Attacker:**  

**Case A: Multiple Players Survive (At War)**  
- Land province with military units from **2+ players** → **At War**  
  - No building in that province during next Construction phase (even if Influence marker held)  
  - Units stay; must fight again in future Combat phases  
- Players who hadn’t moved yet may **move Legions out** when their turn comes  
- Sea spaces with multiple players are **not At War** – free movement and transport allowed  

**Case B: Only One Invading Player Survives**  
Invader chooses one action:  
a. **Sack the Province**: Destroy 1 building (City, Caravan, Temple, or Market)  
b. **Occupy the Province**:  
   - Place 1 Legion/Creature on each City or Caravan to claim income  
   - Place 1 Legion/Creature on Market or Temple to **double income** from another Legion in province  
c. **Convert the Province**:  
   - Place 1 Legion/Creature on opponent’s Influence marker  
   - During next **Construction phase**, may replace marker with own (pay full cost, follow normal rules)  
   - Until then, province remains under **original owner’s control**  

**Special Rule: The Greek Blockade**  
- When attacking a province with **Greek Influence marker**, using **triremes to transport**, attacker must **declare** which triremes are attempting to break the blockade.  
- Greek player may use **own triremes** to attack any of those declared triremes, **in any sea space** where invasion is crossing sea, provided Greek has trireme there.  
- If transporting trireme is destroyed:  
  - Transported unit returns to starting province  
  - May make another move this turn  
- If blockade fails and chain of triremes maintained, invader proceeds normally.
