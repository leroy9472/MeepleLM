## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Age of War: Empires, players take on the roles of feudal warlords during Japan’s Sengoku period, vying for dominance through area control and strategic campaigns. The goal is to conquer territories, complete clans (color groups), and earn the most Empire Points by the end of the game. Special empire abilities are unlocked by fully conquering key regions, adding asymmetrical advantages. The game ends when all territories are claimed, and the player with the most points wins.

2. Components  
- Game board showing Japanese territories with land and sea connections  
- Territory cards or tiles (e.g., Chosukabe) representing castles or regions  
- Dice (standard six-sided or symbol dice, depending on version)  
- Player markers or tokens (to indicate ownership)  
- Unrest tokens (in solo variant)  
- Empire Bonus Ability reference sheet  
- Cards may include clan/color designations, battle lines, point values, and special abilities  

3. Setup  
- Lay out all territory cards face-up in a central grid or on the map board.  
- Shuffle and place cards according to geographic or random layout (as preferred).  
- Each player receives standard components (dice, markers).  
- In solo mode (Demon Daimyo), place 14 castle cards face-up in a grid; place unrest tokens in a central pool.  
- Determine starting player.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game alternates between player turns. In the solo variant, phases are:
- Automaton Phase: Roll 2D6 to determine safe castles; place unrest tokens on others. Add dice to determine which castle is attacked. Assess control: castles with 4+ unrest tokens flip or transfer control.
- Player Phase: On your turn, roll dice and attempt to conquer a territory by fulfilling its battle lines. You may:
  - Conquer neutral (central grid) castles by filling all standard battle lines.
  - Conquer automaton-controlled castles by also filling the special daimyo battle line.
  - Flip conquered neutral cards face-down in place; move conquered automaton cards to your area.
  - Trigger special abilities (e.g., Tanegashima: capture a castle on first roll if all lines are fulfilled; Ashigaru: gain an extra turn if daimyo line is filled and first castle is from central grid).
- After conquest, if all castles of a clan (color) are controlled by one player, flip them face-down and remove from play (immune to conquest).

5. Core Mechanics  
- Dice Rolling: Roll 7 dice (standard or symbol-based). Match results to battle lines on target card.
- Battle Lines: Each territory has multiple lines requiring specific die results (e.g., 2 Cavalry, 5 Soldiers). Lines must be filled one per roll (unless special ability allows otherwise).
- Soldiers: Cumulative. Total soldier symbols (1, 2, 3) can meet or exceed requirement.
- Area Control: Adjacency and movement matter. To attack Hiroshima, a player must control Kumamoto and take intervening territories along arrow paths.
- Sea Lanes: White lines allow naval access, enabling attacks on non-adjacent seaside territories.
- Empire Abilities: Conquering all castles in a region (e.g., Chosukabe) grants a one-time ability (e.g., "Mariner" – attack any seaside castle by ship, ignoring movement rules).
- Special Rules (Solo Variant):
  - Tanegashima: On first roll, fulfill all lines of a castle to capture it immediately.
  - Ashigaru: If you place a daimyo in the special line and capture the castle, take an extra turn (must target same clan; ends if attacking automaton-held castle).
  - Political Influence: Gain a point when "rolling over" a castle; spend to change a die face. Defender may spend to cancel.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when all castle cards are claimed (either by players or automaton) and no neutral cards remain.
- Completed clans (all cards of a color) are worth bonus points (value on back of one card per continent/clan).
- Players tally points from individual cards and full clans.
- In solo play, compare player’s total to automaton’s; player wins if they have more.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can you attack any territory with "Mariner"?  
  Only seaside castles. The ability allows one-time ignoring of land/sea movement restrictions to attack any seaside territory.
- Can Ashigaru chain indefinitely?  
  Only as long as you attack neutral (central grid) castles of the same clan. Capturing from automaton ends the chain.
- What happens to unrest tokens when a castle is conquered?  
  Return all unrest tokens on that castle to the pool.
- Can you use multiple empire abilities?  
  Yes, if earned, but each is one-time use only.
- Do completed clans count toward victory?  
  Yes, and they are immune to reconquest.
