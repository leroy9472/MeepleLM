## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Adel Verpflichtet* (also known as *Hoity Toity*), players are eccentric aristocrats competing to host the most prestigious dinner party. The goal is to amass the most valuable collection of art and antiques, then advance along a track to be the first (or furthest) to reach the dinner table. Victory is determined by track position after a final scoring round.

2. Components  
- 6 player pawns (colors: black, red, blue, green, purple, beige)  
- 60 large treasure cards (lettered A–F, numbered sequentially within each letter)  
- 48 action cards:  
  - 24 "Phase 1" cards (Place cards: #1 on back) — 4 per player (Castle or Auction Hall)  
  - 24 "Phase 2" cards (Action cards: #2 on back) — per player:  
    - 4 Cash cards (total $50,000 value)  
    - 2 Thief cards  
    - 1 Detective card  
    - 1 Exhibition card (implied by context)  
- Game board with:  
  - Movement track ending in a dinner table space  
  - Two octagonal number spaces at each track position (used for Castle movement)  
  - Register (cash tracking space)  
  - Prison/jail area with up to 6 cells (only as many used as there are players)  
- 2 face-up card piles (draw stacks of large treasure cards)

3. Setup  
1. Randomly assign each player a pawn color. Each player takes the 10 small cards (4 Place cards + 6 Action cards) matching their color.  
2. Shuffle the 60 large treasure cards and deal 4 to each player.  
3. Divide the remaining treasure cards into 2 face-up piles and place them on designated spots on the board.  
4. Determine player order (not specified, assumed clockwise or by mutual agreement).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of four phases:

**Phase 1: Choose Location (Where?)**  
- Each player selects a Place card (Castle or Auction House) and plays it face-down.  
- All cards are revealed simultaneously. Players now know where everyone is going.

**Phase 2: Choose Action (What?)**  
- Each player selects an Action card (#2 on back) and plays it face-down:  
  - Players at Auction House: choose Cash, Thief, or Detective  
  - Players at Castle: choose Exhibition, Thief, or Detective  
- Cards remain face-down until resolution.

**Phase 3: Resolve Auction House Actions**  
- All players at Auction House reveal their Action cards.  
- **Cash Cards**: The player with the highest total Cash value pays that amount. They take one of the two face-up treasure cards. The cash is placed on the Register. Other players keep their Cash cards.  
- **Thief**:  
  - If exactly one Thief is played, that player steals the cash just paid and adds it to their hand (as a Cash card).  
  - If multiple Thieves are played, they cancel out — all Thief cards return to players’ hands. No theft occurs.  

**Phase 4: Resolve Castle Actions**  
- All players at the Castle reveal their Action cards. Resolve in this order:

**A. Exhibitions**  
- Each player choosing Exhibition assembles a valid exhibit face-down (see *Definitions*).  
- All exhibits are revealed simultaneously.  
- Determine top two exhibits:  
  - Most valuable = most cards. Tiebreaker = oldest (lowest-numbered) single card.  
- Movement:  
  - The two highest exhibitors move forward.  
  - Movement values come from the octagon on the space of the **current lead player** (not the exhibitor).  
  - 1st place exhibitor uses the higher number, 2nd place uses the lower.

**B. Thief Actions**  
- All players who played a Thief steal:  
  - Starting with the highest-numbered Thief, each steals 1 treasure card from each exhibiting player.  
  - Thief steals from the exhibit set (not hand).  
  - If an exhibit is reduced to fewer than 3 cards or has gaps, it remains invalid but the theft stands.

**C. Detective Actions**  
- If any Thieves were played:  
  - All Thieves are captured and placed in jail.  
  - Lowest-numbered Thief goes to Cell #1, next to #2, etc.  
  - Jail size = number of players. If jail is full, the Thief in the highest-numbered cell is released (returned to hand) when a new one enters.  
- Each player who played a Detective moves forward a number of spaces equal to their **current position** on the track (1st = 1 space, 2nd = 2 spaces, etc.).  
- Position is determined **before** any exhibit movement. Ties count as one position (e.g., three players tied for 2nd = positions 1–2–2–2–5).

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Simultaneous Selection**: All decisions are hidden and revealed at once, preventing direct reaction.  
- **Exhibit Building**: Valid exhibit = 3+ cards with no gaps in letter sequence (e.g., A-B-C, A-A-B, A-B-B-C). Repeats allowed. Gaps (e.g., A-C) invalid.  
- **Jail System**:  
  - Number of jail cells = number of players.  
  - Thieves enter in ascending order (lowest number first).  
  - When full, overflow Thieves push others out the top — released Thief returns to owner’s hand.  
- **Position-Based Movement**: Detective movement depends on track position at start of phase.  
- **Tie Resolution**: Tied positions do not affect lower rankings (e.g., 1–2–2–2–5).

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends **immediately** after the turn in which any player lands on or passes the dinner table space.  
- Final Scoring Phase:  
  - All players simultaneously prepare their best possible exhibit (3+ cards, no gaps).  
  - Reveal all final exhibits.  
  - Scoring:  
    - Highest-value exhibit: move forward 8 spaces.  
    - Second-highest: move forward 4 spaces.  
    - Tiebreaker: best exhibit wins.  
- **Victory**: The player(s) furthest along the track wins. Ties are possible.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Detective Movement Timing**:  
  - Detective movement is based on positions **before** exhibit movement.  
  - Example: Player in 4th place is passed by an exhibitor. They still move 4 spaces (their original position).  
- **Multiple Thieves at Castle**:  
  - All are jailed if any Detective is played.  
  - Stealing happens in descending order of Thief number (highest first).  
- **Ties in Exhibits**:  
  - First tiebreaker: most cards.  
  - Second: oldest (lowest-numbered) single card in the exhibit.  
- **Thief in Auction House**:  
  - Only succeeds if **exactly one** is played.  
  - Steals the entire amount paid to the Register.  
- **Jail Overflow**:  
  - When a new Thief enters and jail is full, the Thief in the highest-numbered cell is released.  
  - Released Thief returns to owner’s hand and can be reused.  
- **2-Player Variant**:  
  - Not detailed, but implied to exist. Standard rules likely apply with adjusted strategy.
