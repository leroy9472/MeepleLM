### 1. Lore & Objective

In the year 1874, European powers are expanding their empires across Asia and Africa. Siam (modern-day Thailand) remains an independent kingdom, caught between British Burma and French Indochina. King Rama V seeks to modernize the country, but internal resistance from the elite classes sparks a power struggle among three factions: Rama (royalists/yellow), Lao (from the north/red), and Malay (from the south/blue). Simultaneously, Britain and France threaten colonization.

Players take on roles maneuvering these factions to gain control of Siam’s provinces. The goal is to maximize personal influence within the dominant faction at game end. If Britain gains control of four provinces, the victory condition shifts: the player with the most complete sets of followers wins.

### 2. Components

- 1 game board showing 8 provinces of Siam  
- 54 follower cubes: 18 yellow (Rama), 18 red (Lao), 18 blue (Malay)  
- 4 decks of 8 action cards each (32 total)  
- 4 player aid cards (each showing two starting follower colors)  
- Control markers:  
  - 8 yellow (Rama)  
  - 8 red (Lao)  
  - 8 blue (Malay)  
  - 4 British control markers  
- 4 king markers ("Maharacha")  
- 8 province tiles  

### 3. Setup

- Each player takes:  
  - 1 deck of 8 action cards  
  - 1 player aid card (except player #4 in 4-player game)  
  - 2 follower cubes matching the colors shown on their aid card  

- Place 4 followers in each province:  
  - In each faction's home province: 2 of that faction’s color + 2 random  
  - In all other provinces: 4 randomly selected followers  

- Return remaining followers to the common pool on the Siam coat of arms on the board  

- Shuffle the 8 province tiles and place one face-up on each numbered space (1–8) on the board  

- Determine starting player: the one with the lowest number on their player aid card  

**Note for 4-player game**:  
- Players sitting opposite each other form teams  
- Player with aid card #4 receives the same follower colors as the player to their left  
- No communication or card sharing allowed between partners  

### 4. Gameplay Flow

The game consists of 8 power struggles—one per province—in the order determined by the numbered board positions (1 to 8).

On a player’s turn, they must either:
- **Pass**, or  
- **Play an action card** (if possible), then take one follower from anywhere on the board

After playing a card:
- Resolve its effect immediately  
- Then take one follower cube from any province or the common pool and add it to your personal supply  

Once all players pass consecutively:
- Determine control of the current province:
  - The faction with the most followers in the province wins control
  - If there is a tie, no faction wins
- Place:
  - The winning faction’s control marker in the province (if there is a winner), or
  - A British Union Jack marker (if no faction wins)
- Return all followers in the province to the common pool
- Begin the next power struggle in the next-numbered province, starting with the player to the left of the last player who passed

Additional rules:
- A player may re-enter the round after passing, as long as not all players have passed
- Once a player has played all 8 of their cards, they must pass on all future turns
- Final card of the game may only be played if it leads to a personal victory (i.e., prevents kingmaking)

### 5. Core Mechanics

**Action Cards:**
- **Maharacha ("King")**: Swap two province tiles, then place a king marker on one to prevent it from being swapped again
- **Khon Thai ("Free People")**: Move one follower of each faction (yellow, red, blue) from the common pool into one or more provinces
- **1 vs 1**: Swap one follower in one province with one follower in another province (any two provinces, not necessarily adjacent)
- **2 vs 1**: Swap two followers in one province with one follower in an **adjacent** province
- **Rama / Lao / Malai cards**: Place two followers of the named faction into one or two provinces, but only if those provinces are:
  - Adjacent to the faction’s home province, **or**
  - Adjacent to a province already controlled by that faction

**General Rules for Cards:**
- Followers cannot be moved into a province already controlled by a faction
- Swapped followers can be of the same color
- A player cannot immediately reverse another player’s "vs" swap using the same card type (no instant "swap back")

**Follower Acquisition:**
- After playing a card, take one follower from anywhere (any province or common pool)
- This follower goes to your personal supply and counts toward influence

### 6. Scoring & End Game

**Game ends immediately if either:**
- Britain controls 4 provinces, or  
- All 8 power struggles are completed

**Determine the winning faction:**
- Count how many provinces each faction (Rama, Lao, Malay) controls
- The faction with the most controlled provinces wins
- In case of a tie: the tied faction that **last gained control** of a province is the winner

**Determine the winner among players:**

- **If Britain wins (controls 4 provinces):**
  - The player with the most **complete sets** of followers (one yellow, one red, one blue per set) wins
  - **Tiebreaker 1**: The tied player who played an action card last wins

- **If a faction (Rama, Lao, Malay) wins:**
  - The player with the most followers of the **winning faction** wins
  - **Tiebreaker 1**: The tied player with the most followers in the **second-ranked faction**
  - **Tiebreaker 2**: Among still-tied players, the one who **last played an action card loses**

**4-player partnership rules:**
- Partners win together
- If Britain wins, partnerships **pool** their complete sets to determine which team wins

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can I play a card if I can't take a follower afterward?**  
  Yes. Playing the card is mandatory if possible; taking a follower follows, even if only one is available.

- **Can I move followers into a controlled province?**  
  No. You cannot place or move followers into a province already controlled by any faction.

- **What happens if a province has no clear majority?**  
  The British Union Jack is placed, and all followers return to the common pool.

- **Can I swap followers of the same color with "1 vs 1"?**  
  Yes. The rule only prohibits immediate reversal of the same swap by the same card.

- **Can I use "Rama" card to place followers in a province adjacent to a Rama-controlled province?**  
  Yes. The card allows placement adjacent to either the Rama home province **or** any Rama-controlled province.

- **What does "last gained control" mean for tiebreaking?**  
  Track the order in which factions gained control. The last one among the tied factions to gain a province wins.

- **Can I play my final card just to block someone?**  
  No. The final card may only be played if doing so leads to **your own victory**.
