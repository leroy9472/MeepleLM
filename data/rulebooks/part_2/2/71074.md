## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 1845, Sir John Franklin led a doomed expedition to chart the Northwest Passage. Players take on the roles of leaders of later search expeditions, venturing into the Arctic to uncover Franklin’s fate and complete his mission by discovering the Northwest Passage.

The goal is to earn the most Prestige points over ten Exploration rounds through exploration, discovery, island mapping, and returning safely to Greenland. Prestige is earned by collecting tokens, completing islands, and achieving majority and set bonuses at the end of the game. Expeditions that fail to return are penalized.

### 2. Components

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player takes their Individual Board, Ship, Sled, Scoring Disc, and 8 Crewmen (7 colored, 1 identical).  
2. Place Ship on the Greenland arrow and Sled on the Individual Board.  
3. Place all 7 colored Crewmen on the “Available” space of the Ship column.  
4. Place the 8th Crewman (turn order marker) on the first line of the turn order track.  
5. Place small Exploration Tiles:  
   - Form six piles of identical tiles on the board spaces marked for small tiles.  
   - All show Exploration side up.  
6. Large Exploration Tiles:  
   - Shuffle and place in the bag.  
   - Draw 4 and place them on the designated spaces on the board.  
7. Place tokens:  
   - Greenland Tokens: in increasing order below the Greenland arrow (number depends on player count).  
   - Northwest Passage Tokens: in decreasing order above the Northwest Passage arrow.  
8. Solar Disc:  
   - Place on position III of the Solar Arch, cold (blue) side up, hot (yellow) side down.  
   - Align so the separation line is horizontal.  
9. Place Cairn Tokens:  
   - One on each of the two pre-printed Cairn symbols on the board.  
10. Determine turn order randomly.  
11. Starting with the last player, each draws one large tile from the available four, which are immediately replaced from the reserve.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts up to 10 Exploration rounds. Each round consists of:  
1. **Action Phase**:  
   - Players take turns in order, performing one or more actions.  
   - Each player must take at least one action per turn unless they pass.  
   - After all players pass, the round ends.  
2. **End of Round**:  
   - Move Solar Disc one space counterclockwise.  
   - Return all Crewmen from “Resting” to “Available” (same column).  
   - Move turn order markers from second line back to first line.  
   - Refill large tile display if needed.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Crew & Actions  
Each player has 7 Crewmen, split between Ship and Sled columns. Crewmen are either “Available” or “Resting.”  
- Actions require spending Crewmen by moving them from “Available” to “Resting.”  
- A player may perform multiple actions per turn, but each additional action costs +1 extra Crewman.  
- Once all Crewmen are resting, the only legal action is **Pass**.

#### Action List  
**A – Draw a Tile** (Cost: 1 Crewman)  
- Draw one large tile from the four available, or one small tile from one of the six piles.  
- Add to personal reserve.  

**B – Refresh Tiles and Draw** (Cost: 2 Crewmen)  
1. Replace all four large tiles on display with new ones from the reserve.  
2. Then draw one tile (large or small) into personal reserve.  

**C – Place a Tile** (Cost: 1 Crewman)  
- Place one tile from personal reserve onto the board.  
- Must be aligned with the grid.  
- Must be adjacent (orthogonally) to a tile where the player has a presence (Ship or Sled).  
- Land/sea must match adjacent tiles (including diagonally).  
- Cannot create a continuous sea path from Greenland to Northwest Passage.  
- If a tile placement creates a gap the size of a small tile, fill it immediately:  
  - Use matching small tile if available.  
  - Otherwise, use any small tile placed Joker-side up (matches adjacent terrain).  
- If tile has a symbol, place the corresponding token (Cairn, Inuit, Franklin, Strait) on it.  
- If placing a tile completes an island (land fully surrounded by water or edge), earn a Cartography token and immediate points (based on island size).  

**D – Movement** (Cost: 1 Crewman)  
- **Ship**: Move to orthogonally adjacent tile connected by unfrozen sea.  
- **Sled**: Move to orthogonally adjacent tile connected by land or frozen area.  
- Multiple units may occupy the same tile.  

**E – Transfer Crew** (Cost: 1 Crewman)  
- Transfer Crewmen between Ship and Sled columns. Status (Available/Resting) remains unchanged.  
- **Sled Deployment**: First transfer to Sled column triggers deployment:  
  - Place Sled on a land or frozen part of the current tile.  
  - Cannot deploy on unfrozen water.  
- If all Crewmen are transferred back to Ship, remove Sled from board and return to Individual Board.  

**F – Explore Franklin Site or Strait** (Cost: 3 Crewmen)  
- Collect Franklin or Strait token if Ship or Sled is on the same tile.  
- Place token on Individual Board and gain immediate Prestige (based on zone multiplier).  

**G – Discover Inuit or Cairn** (Cost: 2 Crewmen)  
- Collect Inuit or Cairn token if Ship or Sled is on the same tile.  
- Place token on Individual Board and gain immediate Prestige (based on zone multiplier).  

**H – Pass**  
- Move all remaining Crewmen to “Resting.”  
- Move turn marker to the next available space on the second line of the turn order track.  
- Player takes no more actions this round.  
- When all players have passed, the round ends.

#### Solar Disc & Frozen Tiles  
The Solar Disc moves counterclockwise each round, determining frozen zones:  
- **Above separation line**: Fully frozen. Sea becomes impassable ice. Ships blocked. Sleds move freely.  
- **Below separation line**: Unfrozen. Ships move on sea, Sleds on land.  
- **Overlapping line**: Upper (frozen) part is land-only; lower (unfrozen) part allows Ship movement on sea.  

**Edge Cases**:  
- If a Ship ends on a now-frozen tile after Solar Disc move, it is blocked until thaw.  
- If a Sled is on a tile that becomes fully unfrozen with no land or frozen area, it and all Crewmen in Sled column are lost.

#### Zones & Prestige  
Board is divided into three vertical zones: x1, x2, x3 (left to right).  
- Tokens collected in a zone earn points multiplied by the zone’s value:  
  - Inuit/Cairn: 2 points × zone multiplier  
  - Franklin/Strait: 1 point × zone multiplier  
- Zone is determined by token’s tile location, even if tile overlaps zones.

#### Northwest Passage & Greenland Return  
- **Northwest Passage**:  
  - When Ship or Sled reaches Northwest Passage arrow, take highest-value available Northwest Passage token.  
  - Gain immediate points. Only one token per player.  
- **Greenland Return**:  
  - Return Ship or Sled to Greenland arrow to take highest-value Greenland token.  
  - Gain immediate points.  
  - Once returned, player exits the game and cannot take further actions.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### End Conditions  
Game ends when:  
- The 10th Exploration round ends, OR  
- All players have returned to Greenland.

#### Final Scoring  
**Exploration Points (Majority Bonuses)**  
For each token type (Franklin, Strait, Cartography):  
- Rank players by number of tokens.  
- Award points per position (shown on Individual Boards).  
- Tie Rule: Tied players occupy the lowest of the tied ranks. Next player takes the next available rank.  
- Players with zero tokens in a category earn no points.

**Set Points**  
- Each complete set (1 Inuit, 1 Cairn, 1 Franklin, 1 Strait, 1 Cartography) = 6 Prestige points.  
- Tokens can be used in both majority and set scoring.

**Abandonment Penalty**  
- Any Ship or Sled not in Greenland at game end is lost.  
- Penalty: -2 points per Crewman in the corresponding column.  
- Additional -2 points per lost Ship or Sled.

#### Winning  
- Highest total Prestige wins.  
- Tiebreaker: Player who returned to Greenland first.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can a tile be placed if it blocks the sea path?**  
  A: No. A tile cannot be placed if it creates a continuous sea path from Greenland to Northwest Passage.  

- **Q: What happens if a Sled is on a tile that becomes fully unfrozen with no land?**  
  A: The Sled and all Crewmen in the Sled column are lost (Case N°2).  

- **Q: Can a Ship move onto a frozen tile?**  
  A: No. Frozen sea is impassable for Ships.  

- **Q: Can a Sled move across frozen sea?**  
  A: Yes. Frozen sea is treated as land for Sleds.  

- **Q: Can a player earn multiple Cartography tokens in one turn?**  
  A: Yes. Each completed island earns a token and points, even if multiple are completed in one action.  

- **Q: Can a player place a Joker tile?**  
  A: Only when filling a gap and no matching tile is available. Joker matches adjacent terrain.  

- **Q: Do zone multipliers apply to final scoring?**  
  A: No. Zone multipliers only apply when tokens are collected. Final scoring uses fixed values.
