          - Gain Specialist and Refresh Captain/Engineer  
          - Gain Spellcar twice  
        - Return Conductor to Start  

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Network**:  
     - In-Network: Hex with your train car.  
     - Network-Adjacent: Hex adjacent to any In-Network hex.  
     - Not required to be connected.  
   - **Deliver**:  
     - At End of Line or via effect.  
     - Take Goods from In-Network to folio.  
     - Take Demand Tile if qualifying:  
       - 2+ Goods → Double (1 VP)  
       - 3+ Goods → Triple (2 VP)  
       - 4+ Goods → Quadruple (3 VP)  
     - Take best eligible tile available.  
   - **Build Track**: Place train car in Network-Adjacent hex of specified terrain. Max 3 per hex.  
   - **Transfers** (cost mana when Building):  
     - Competitor Transfer: over hex with opponent’s train (cost 2)  
     - City Transfer: over City (cost 3)  
     - Wasteland Transfer: over Wasteland (cost 4)  
     - Free Transfers may be granted by Spellcars.  
   - **Place Wasteland**: Destroys Goods in hex, train cars remain. Cannot place on City or existing Wasteland.  
   - **Mana**:  
     - Max 10. Gain new crystals via effects.  
     - Spend to move or activate. Reclaim via Administrate or effects.  
   - **Spellcars**:  
     - Placed in railyard; fill second row before third.  
     - Effects vary (Build, Gain, Reclaim, etc.).  
     - Inherent costs must be paid.  

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - **Game End Trigger**:  
     - Any player collects required Demand Tiles:  
       - 2–3 players: 6  
       - 4 players: 5  
       - 5+ players: 4  
     - OR runs out of train cars.  
   - **Final Turns**:  
     - All players take equal turns (until Start Player’s turn would begin).  
     - Then, in reverse turn order, each makes **one final delivery** (no full turn).  
   - **Final Scoring**:  
     - **Goods Delivered**: 1 VP per Good in folio.  
     - **Demand Tiles**: VP as printed (1, 2, or 3).  
     - **Awards**: For each of 2 face-up Award Tiles:  
       - 1st: 6 VP  
       - 2nd: 4 VP  
       - 3rd (4+ players): 2 VP  
       - 2-player games: only 1st gets 4 VP  
       - Must have ≥1 toward objective to qualify.  
     - **Tie Rules**:  
       - 2-way tie: add 1st and 2nd values, split evenly.  
       - 3+ way tie: add 1st, 2nd, 3rd values, split evenly (round down).  
   - **Tiebreakers**:  
     1. Most Goods delivered  
     2. Most train cars placed  
     3. Furthest from Start Player (reverse turn order)  

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **In-Network vs Network-Adjacent**: A hex is one or the other, never both.  
   - **No Valid Wasteland Placement**: Skip the effect.  
   - **Ability Stacking**: Yes, unless specified otherwise.  
   - **Optional Build Effects**: You may choose not to Build even if ability allows.  
   - **Supply Exhaustion**: If no Goods or tiles available, skip effect.  
   - **Team Play (Variant)**:  
     - Teams alternate seats (e.g., A-B-A-B).  
     - No Awards.  
     - Transfers over teammate’s trains cost 1.  
     - Competitor effects don’t affect teammates.  
     - Score teams: sum Goods and Demand Tiles.  
     - Bonus: 5 VP per Good color to team with most.
