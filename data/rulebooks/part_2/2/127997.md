## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Set over 2000 years ago in China during the Warring States period, players compete to colonize the hinterland, found and expand provinces, and absorb villages into their growing empires. Magnificent pagodas are built as symbols of authority. The first player to place all of their pagodas wins the game. However, opponents can conquer your provinces and villages, removing and replacing your pagodas. Strategic expansion and control are key to establishing the glorious Qin Dynasty.

**Objective:** Be the first to place all of your pagodas on the board. If no one does, the player who has placed the most pagodas wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 double-sided game board (recommended side for first game: "Bird")  
- 72 tiles (12 of each of 6 types)  
  - Each tile shows 2 province spaces (red, yellow, or blue)  
- 96 pagodas (24 in each of 4 player colors)  

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center of the table. Choose either side ("Bird" recommended for first game).  
2. Carefully punch out all tiles from the sheets.  
3. Shuffle the tiles and deal 3 face-down tiles to each player. These form their initial hand.  
4. Place the remaining tiles in several face-down stacks beside the board.  
5. Distribute pagodas by player count:  
   - 2 players: 24 pagodas each  
   - 3 players: 19 pagodas each  
   - 4 players: 15 pagodas each  
6. Each player places their pagodas in front of them in full view. Return unused pagodas to the box.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise, starting with the youngest player.  
- On your turn:  
  1. **Play a Tile:** Choose one tile from your hand and place it on the board.  
     - Must be placed on grassland spaces only (not on provinces, villages, or water).  
     - At least one province space on the tile must share an **edge** (not just a corner) with an existing province space of any color.  
     - You may rotate the tile before placing.  
  2. **Trigger Events:** Resolve all applicable events in any order:  
     - Found Province  
     - Expand Province  
     - Create Major Province  
     - Connect Village  
     - Conquer Village  
     - Absorb Province  
  3. **Draw a Tile:** At the end of your turn, draw one tile from any available stack.  
     - If no stacks remain, you cannot draw and must continue with remaining hand tiles.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### 1. Found Province  
- When placing a tile creates a new contiguous group of **2 or more same-colored province spaces**, a new province is founded.  
- The player who placed the tile places **one of their pagodas** on the new province.  
- Multiple new provinces can be created in a single turn (e.g., one red and one yellow).  

#### 2. Expand Province  
- When a tile connects (by edge) to an existing province of the same color, that province is expanded.  
- No additional pagoda is placed unless this expansion triggers a Major Province (see below).  

#### 3. Create Major Province  
- When a province reaches **5 or more contiguous spaces** of the same color, it becomes a **Major Province**.  
- The owner places a **second pagoda on top** of the existing one to form a **double pagoda**.  
- Only one double pagoda per Major Province is allowed.  
- Major Provinces are permanent and cannot be absorbed.  

#### 4. Connect Village  
- After tile placement, if a player’s province or Major Province shares an edge with an **unoccupied village**, that player **claims the village** by placing one of their pagodas on it.  
- A village can hold only one pagoda.  
- Tip: Prioritize connecting unoccupied villages to your own provinces.  

#### 5. Conquer Village  
- A village changes ownership if a player has **more adjacent pagodas** than the current owner.  
- Adjacent pagodas are those in provinces or Major Provinces sharing an edge with the village.  
- **Double pagodas count as 2**.  
- **The pagoda on the village itself does not count** toward ownership.  
- If two or more players are tied for most adjacent pagodas, the village **cannot be conquered**.  
- When conquered: remove the old pagoda, place the new one.  

#### 6. Absorb Province  
- When a tile connects **two or more separate same-colored provinces**, they merge into a single Major Province.  
- The player who contributed the **most province spaces** in the original provinces takes control.  
  - Do **not** count the spaces on the tile used to connect them.  
- All displaced pagodas are returned to their owners.  
- **Prohibited** if two or more players would contribute **equal total spaces**, as no owner can be determined.  
- **Major Provinces cannot be combined**, but a Major Province can absorb smaller provinces.  
- After absorption: only one double pagoda is allowed; remove extras if needed.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when **any player places their last pagoda** on the board. That player **wins**.

**Alternative End Conditions:**  
- All players run out of tiles **and**  
- No legal moves remain (no grassland spaces with adjacent provinces)  

Then, the player who has **placed the most pagodas** on the board wins.  
- **Tie:** Victory is shared.  

**Optional Series Play:**  
- Play one game per board side.  
- After each game, record how many pagodas each player has left.  
- After the final game, the player with the **lowest total number of remaining pagodas** wins the series.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a tile that creates two isolated single province spaces?**  
  Yes, but it triggers no province founding and is rarely beneficial.

- **Do villages count as province spaces for adjacency?**  
  No. Only province spaces (red, yellow, blue) count for tile placement adjacency.

- **Can a Major Province absorb multiple small provinces at once?**  
  Yes, as long as the tile connects them and the owner has the largest original province.

- **What happens if absorbing provinces creates a tie in contribution?**  
  The move is **not allowed**. You cannot place the tile in that configuration.

- **Can I conquer a village I just connected to?**  
  Yes, if your adjacent pagoda count exceeds the current owner’s (or it’s unoccupied).

- **Do I draw a tile after placing my last pagoda?**  
  No. The game ends immediately when a player places their last pagoda.
