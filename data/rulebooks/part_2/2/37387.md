## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Players are investment brokers investing in and building railway companies during the early rail era in the United States. The goal is to accumulate the most cash over five turns and a final scoring phase. Victory is determined by total cash; investment cubes have no residual value. The game ends after five regular turns and a special sixth scoring turn.

2. **Components**  
- Game board with cities, routes, hexagonal starting spaces, and circular destination spaces  
- 6 company control markers (train engines), each corresponding to a company (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black)  
- Share tokens (small flat disks) and control markers (taller disks)  
- Investment cubes (white)  
- Profit track with markers for each company  
- Order of Play track  
- Goods cubes (colored cubes, one per company)  
- Score sheet (implied)

3. **Setup**  
1. Place company control markers and share tokens in their respective company boxes at the top of the board.  
2. Set the Order of Play by placing one tall share token per company in order: Red 1st, Black 6th.  
3. Place one company share token per company on the $0 space of the profit track.  
4. Place a black game marker on the 1st "active company" box. Give the 2nd active player marker to the youngest player (starting player).  
5. Investment cubes are distributed at the start of each turn depending on player count.  
6. Hexagonal spaces are starting points; circular spaces are regular cities with profit values. Blue boxes on routes indicate build cost in investment cubes.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
The game lasts 5 turns, each with 5 phases, followed by a final scoring phase (6th turn):

**Phase 1: Take Investment Cubes**  
- Players receive cubes based on player count:  
  - 3 players: 10 cubes each  
  - 4 players: 8 cubes  
  - 5 players: 7 cubes  
  - 6 players: 6 cubes  
- Unspent cubes carry over between turns.

**Phase 2: Auction Control Markers**  
- Active player selects one company control marker and initiates a bid (minimum 1 cube) or passes.  
- Bidding proceeds clockwise; players may pass but cannot re-enter.  
- Highest bidder wins the control marker and gains one share in that company. Payment is made in investment cubes to the company’s box.  
- Active player marker passes to the left after each auction.  
- Repeat until all 6 companies are auctioned or all players pass consecutively.  
- If all pass, active player passes to the left of the last bidder.  
- Unauctioned control markers remain in company boxes.  
- A player may control multiple companies.

**Phase 3: Build Track**  
- Companies build in Order of Play (Red to Black).  
- The player controlling a company spends cubes from that company’s box to build track.  
- First build must start from a hexagonal city. Subsequent builds must connect to existing track of the same company.  
- Only one track per route.  
- Cost is shown in blue boxes.  
- If a company lacks funds, it passes. Its Order of Play token is moved to the "pass row" (determines next turn’s order).  
- After building, the company gains profit equal to the value of the newly connected city.  
  - First build: profit from connected city is added (starting hex value is not counted).  
  - A company cannot profit from the same city twice.  
- The phase continues in cycles until all companies pass.  
- Unspent cubes remain in company boxes.

**Phase 4: Take Profits**  
- Each player receives cash equal to the current profit level of each company they control.  
- Only current control counts—shares from prior turns do not grant income now.  
- Multiple companies controlled = multiple payouts.

**Phase 5: End of Turn**  
- Move Order of Play tokens from pass row back to Order of Play row, preserving relative order.  
- Reset all company profit markers to $0.  
- Return all control markers to their company boxes (except after Turn 5—see Final Scoring).  
- Unspent investment cubes remain in company boxes.  
- Shares are retained by players.  
- Number of turns remaining is tracked by shares remaining in company boxes.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Transcontinental Link Bonus**: Triggered when a continuous route connects San Francisco to New York.  
  - The company completing the final link gains $50 bonus + profit from the connected city.  
  - All other companies with track on the link gain $30.  
  - The link must use the fewest companies possible.  
  - If multiple valid paths exist, use the one with the fewest track segments.  
  - In case of a tie, all tied companies receive the bonus.

- **Final Profit Determination (6th Turn)**  
  1. Remove all unspent investment cubes from company boxes. These are now "goods cubes".  
  2. Place one goods cube (matching company color) on each city connected by a company’s track.  
  3. Determine control of each company: player with the most shares takes the control marker.  
     - Tie: player closest clockwise to current controller gains control.  
  4. In Order of Play, each company (controlled by its player) claims one goods cube from a connected city.  
     - Controlling player chooses which cube to take.  
     - Company passes when no more cubes can be claimed.  
  5. Final profit per company is based on sets of goods cubes:  
     - 1 cube: $10  
     - 2 cubes: $30  
     - 3 cubes: $60  
     - 4 cubes: $100  
     - 5 cubes: $150  
     - Sets must be of different colors.  
  6. Players receive cash equal to (number of shares owned) × (final profit level of the company).

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- Total cash = sum of all profit payouts over 5 turns + final share round.  
- Winner: player with most cash.  
- Tiebreaker: player who controls the company (or companies) with the most goods cubes.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can a company build multiple times per turn?**  
  Yes. The Build Track phase cycles through companies until all pass. A company may build multiple times if it has funds and legal routes.

- **Can a company profit from the same city twice?**  
  No. Once a city is connected, it cannot generate profit again for that company.

- **What if a company has no legal builds?**  
  It must pass. Its Order of Play token is placed in the first empty space of the pass row.

- **Can a player control more than one company?**  
  Yes. Players may win control of multiple companies via auction.

- **What happens to leftover investment cubes?**  
  They remain in the company box and can be used in future turns.

- **How is the Order of Play determined next turn?**  
  Based on the order in which companies passed during the Build Track phase. Leftmost to rightmost in the pass row becomes 1st to 6th.

- **Are goods cubes reused?**  
  No. Each city has one goods cube placed at the start of the final scoring.

- **Can a company profit from the starting hex?**  
  No. The starting hex value is considered operating cost and is never added to profit.
