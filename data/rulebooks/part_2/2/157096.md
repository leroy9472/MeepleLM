  No. Must have **≥3 Action Cards** in discard queue at start of action phase.

  Yes. As many as conditions allow.

  No. Only human players count for majority conditions.

  Only to a **Civbot War**. In human-vs-human War, last cube stays.  

- **What if Wonder Row is empty?**  
  No replacement until Turn End reset. You cannot play Art.  

- **Can I use Advanced Action without required tech?**  
  No. Requirement must be met.  

- **Do I get Development Bonuses immediately?**  
  Yes. Bonuses (e.g., card recovery, extra actions) can be used in same Action Round.
