### 1. Lore & Objective
World War I, known as the Great War, was a conflict defined by technological advancement, intense nationalism, and unprecedented attrition. In *Quartermaster General: 1914*, players take control of one or more Powers aligned with either the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary & Ottoman Turkey, Germany) or the Entente Powers (Russia, France & Italy, United Kingdom & United States). The objective is to earn more Victory Points (VPs) than the opposing team by the end of the game.

Victory can be achieved in two ways:
- **Sudden Victory**: One team leads by 12 or more VPs at the end of any Scoring Round.
- **Scoring Victory**: After 17 rounds, the team with more VPs wins. In case of a tie, the Central Powers win.

Scoring Rounds occur at the end of rounds 3, 7, 11, 15, and 17, immediately after the United Kingdom / United States turn.

### 2. Components
- 1 Game board (map of Europe divided into Land, Sea, and Neutral spaces)
- 1 Rules booklet
- 216 Cards (divided among Powers)

  - Ottoman Turkey: 4
  - Russia: 8
  - Germany: 7
  - France: 6
  - Italy: 4
  - United Kingdom: 5
  - United States: 4

  - Austria-Hungary: 1
  - Russia: 2
  - Germany: 2
  - France: 2
  - Italy: 1
  - United Kingdom: 5
  - United States: 3
- 2 Scoring markers (Victory Point and Game Round)
- 6 Objective tokens
- 5 Player Aid sheets

### 3. Setup
#### Player / Power Assignments
All five Powers are used in every game. With fewer than five players, divide Powers according to player count:
- 2 players: Each plays 2–3 Powers.
- 3–5 players: Assign Powers so all are played.

Each Power acts independently, even when controlled by the same player.

#### Opening Setup
1. Place each team’s Victory Point marker at 0 on the VP track.
2. Place the Game Round marker on Round 1.
3. Give each player a Player Aid sheet.
4. Shuffle each Power’s deck.
5. Draw 10 cards from your Power’s deck, choose 7 to keep, place the remaining 3 at the bottom of the deck.

#### Optional: Mulligan Rule
If your initial 10-card draw is unplayable, you may reshuffle and draw 10 again. You must keep the second draw; no further mulligans allowed.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
A full game lasts up to 17 rounds. Each round consists of turns taken in this order:
1. Austria-Hungary / Ottoman Turkey  
2. Russia  
3. Germany  
4. France / Italy  
5. United Kingdom / United States

Each turn has five optional steps:
1. **Draft Step**: Discard 2 cards to search for and take a Build Army or Build Navy card into hand.
2. **Play Step**: Play one card from hand (Build, Event, Status, etc.).
3. **Attrition Step**: Discard one prepared card with an Attrition symbol to force enemy discards.
4. **Prepare Step**: Prepare one card face-down or unprepare one card back to hand.
5. **Draw Step**: Draw cards until you have 7 in hand.

After the final turn of rounds 3, 7, 11, 15, and 17, a Scoring Round occurs.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Pieces
- **Army**: Placed on Land spaces.
- **Navy**: Placed on Sea spaces.
- Only one piece per country per space.
- Allied countries (same team) may coexist in a space.
- No pieces in Neutral spaces.
- Enemy pieces cannot occupy the same space.

#### Supply
A piece is **supplied** if a continuous chain of its country’s pieces connects it to its **Home space**, which must be occupied by its Army.

- Required for:
  - Building new pieces.
  - Initiating battles.
  - Using Reinforce Army cards (unless the card has the Supply symbol).
- Not required for:
  - Recruiting.
  - Scoring VPs.
  - Using prepared cards in Attrition.

#### Placing Pieces
- **Build**: Place a piece in a space only if it will be in supply upon placement. Done via Build cards.
- **Recruit**: Place a piece regardless of supply. Does not count as a build for card triggers.

#### Cards
Each Power has its own deck. Cards have:
- Type (Build Army, Status, Event, etc.)
- Play Text
- Prepare Symbol(s)
- Prepare Text (geographic or conditional use)
- Supply Symbol (allows defending out-of-supply pieces)

##### Playing a Card
During Play Step, play one card. Only its **type** and **Play text** are used. Ignore Prepare and Supply symbols. Card is discarded face-up to the top of the discard pile.

##### Preparing a Card
During Prepare Step, place one card face-down from hand. It becomes a **prepared card**, referred to by its Prepare symbol (e.g., Sustain Land Battle). Its type and Play text are ignored.

- Prepared cards can be used in battle, Attrition, or to satisfy discards.
- Cards with double symbols (e.g., Double Reinforce) can substitute for single symbols, subject to Prepare text.

##### Unpreparing a Card
Instead of preparing, you may return one prepared card to your hand.

##### Discarding Cards
- **Face-up discard** (top of pile): When card’s front is used (e.g., played, used in battle). Visible to all.
- **Face-down discard** (bottom of pile): When card is discarded without using its front (e.g., draft, Attrition, difficult terrain). Not revealed.

Discards due to forced effects (e.g., Economic Warfare, Attrition) are:
- From hand, prepared cards, or top of draw deck (blind).
- Not from face-up Status cards.
- Power-specific (not country-specific); not revealed.

If unable to discard:
- Lose 1 VP per card required (except for Status cards — no penalty).
- Cannot voluntarily lose VPs if draw deck has cards.

##### Draft Step
Discard 2 cards to search your draw deck for a Build Army or Build Navy card, show it, and add to hand. Shuffle deck afterward. Only one draft per turn.

Some cards allow "free" drafts (no discard cost), in addition to your normal draft.

##### Attrition Step
Discard one prepared card with an Attrition symbol:
- Single black symbol: Target any enemy Power if one of your Armies is adjacent to theirs (no supply needed).
- Multiple symbols: Target specified Powers (icons on card).

Each targeted Power must discard one card per symbol (using rules above).

##### Battle
**Prerequisites**:
- Attacker must have a **supplied** piece adjacent to the target space.
- Must indicate which piece initiates the battle.

**Difficult Terrain**:
- Marked in brown on the board (e.g., Serbia, Vienna).
- Battle into DT requires discarding one card from hand (face-down, bottom of discard pile).
- Navy attacking Land or Army attacking Sea = DT (but not cumulative with terrain DT).

**Resolving Battle**:
1. **Defender** may discard prepared Reinforce cards (Army/Navy) to prevent removal.
   - Reinforce Army requires defending piece to be in supply, unless the card has the Supply symbol.
   - If multiple defending countries, any one may use a prepared card (team decides openly).
2. **Attacker** may discard Sustain Battle cards (Land/Sea) to overcome Reinforce.
   - Must match or exceed total Reinforce symbols.
   - In DT, must discard one card per Sustain card used.
3. Turns alternate until one side stops.

**Outcome**:
- If attacker sustains successfully, all enemy pieces in the space are removed.
- If attacker fails, pieces remain.

**Counterattack**:
- After failed Land battle, defender may use a prepared **Counterattack** card.
- Requirements:
  - Army of using country must be supplied.
  - Can only attack Land space from which attack originated.
  - Resolved like normal battle (with DT cost if applicable).
- Success removes all defending pieces in the target space.

**Eliminate vs. Battle**:
- **Eliminate**: Remove piece without prerequisites (no supply, no adjacent piece, no discard in DT).
- **Battle**: Requires all standard rules.

#### Kiel Canal
- Baltic Sea and North Sea are adjacent **for Central Powers only**.
- Allows naval movement/connection between seas for Germany/Austria-Hungary.

#### Objectives & Scoring
- Objective tokens are placed by certain Event cards.
- Only one token per space.
- Tokens stay for the game.
- **Scoring Rounds**: At end of rounds 3, 7, 11, 15, 17.
  - Each team gains 1 VP per Objective space occupied by their Army.
  - Includes spaces with Objective tokens.
  - Armies do **not** need to be in supply to score.
  - Only 1 VP per Objective, even with multiple allied armies.

- **Home Space Occupied**:
  - If a country’s Home space is occupied by enemy during Scoring Round, that country’s Armies and Status cards cannot score.
  - For dual-country Powers (e.g., France/Italy), if one country’s Home is occupied, the other can still score.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Sudden Victory**: If one team leads by 12+ VPs at any Scoring Round, they win immediately.
- **Final Victory**: After Round 17, higher score wins. Tie → Central Powers win.
- VP penalties:
  - Lose 1 VP per card you cannot discard when required.
  - Cannot go below 0 VP; if at 0, add VPs to enemy instead.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I play multiple cards in a turn?** No. Only one Play Step per turn, unless a card grants an extra action.
- **Can I prepare and unprepare in the same turn?** No. Prepare Step allows one action: either prepare or unprepare.
- **Can teammates show each other cards?** No. Hands and prepared cards are private. Only top discard and Status cards are public.
- **Can I battle an empty space?** Yes, if it helps (e.g., to trigger Status cards).
- **Can I use a double-symbol card for a single requirement?** Yes, as long as Prepare text allows.
- **What if my deck runs out?** You continue playing with prepared cards and may still unprepare. Cannot draw, but can still draft if able.
- **Does recruiting count as building?** No. Cards requiring "built" pieces are not triggered by recruitment.
