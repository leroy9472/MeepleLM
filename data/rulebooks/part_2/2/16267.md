## Trans Europa – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Trans Europa is a strategic connection game where players build rail networks across Europe to link five cities of different colors. The goal is to be the first to connect all five of your assigned cities. Once a player succeeds, the round ends and others are penalized based on how close they were to completion. The game is played over multiple rounds, and the player with the highest score after the final round wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board (map of Europe with cities and possible rail lines)  
- 83 black track markers (single-line segments)  
- 35 city cards in 5 colors (7 per color)  
- 6 starting marker cylinders (one per player color)  
- 6 locomotive pawns for tracking scores  
- 1 starting player card  

### 3. Setup  
- Place the board in the center and put the track markers nearby.  
- Each player chooses a color and takes the corresponding starting marker and locomotive pawn.  
- Place each player’s locomotive on the red "0" space at the top of the scoring track (above space 12).  
- **For 2–3 players**: Remove 10 city cards—2 from each color (those with striped borders around the city image).  
- Shuffle the remaining city cards (35 for 4–6 players, 25 for 2–3 players).  
- Deal all cards face down onto the board’s city spaces (one card per city).  
- Each player draws 5 city cards—one of each color—in secret. These are their target cities to connect.  
- Set aside the remaining cards without revealing them (for use in future rounds).  
- The starting player takes the starting player card.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise starting with the starting player.  
- **First action of the round (all players)**:  
  Each player places their starting marker on any unoccupied intersection (including cities). This becomes the origin of their rail network.  
  *Tip:* Placing too close to another player may not be strategically wise.  
- **Subsequent turns**:  
  On a turn, a player must do one of the following:  
  - Place **1 or 2 track markers** on **single-line routes** (standard land routes).  
  - **Or** place **1 track marker** on a **double-line route** (river crossings, mountain tunnels, or sea crossings).  
  - A player must always place at least **one** track marker per turn.  
  - Tracks must be placed adjacent to the player’s existing network (connected directly to their starting marker or previously placed tracks).  
  - Multiple players’ networks may connect and share routes.  
  - If placing two single-line tracks, they do not need to be adjacent to each other.  
  *Tip:* Connecting to other players’ networks early is not always beneficial.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Network Growth**: Players expand their rail network from their starting point. All new tracks must be adjacent to their current network.  
- **Route Types**:  
  - Single-line routes: Require one track marker.  
  - Double-line routes (e.g., tunnels, ferries): Require one track marker but count as two connections for scoring penalties.  
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Players may use connections made by others—there is no blocking.  
- **Turn Structure**:  
  1. Place starting marker (first turn only).  
  2. On each turn: place 1–2 markers (subject to route type rules).  
  3. Ensure at least one track is placed per turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End of Round Trigger**:  
  The round ends immediately when any player successfully connects all **five** of their target cities with an unbroken rail path.  
  - The player reveals their cards to verify the connection.  
  - If incorrect (i.e., not all five connected), the game continues with all players’ cards revealed.  
  - **Exception**: If a player places the first of two tracks and that action completes another player’s network, they must still place the second track if intended and legal.  
  - **Alternative End**: If all track markers are used before any player completes their network, the round ends.  
- **Scoring Penalties**:  
  Players who did **not** complete their network lose points based on missing connections:  
  - **–1 point** per missing segment on a **single-line route**.  
  - **–2 points** per missing segment on a **double-line route**.  
  - Only the number of track segments needed to complete the shortest path to each unconnected city is counted.  
- **Reset for Next Round**:  
  - Remove all track markers from the board.  
  - Players keep their starting markers.  
  - Shuffle all city cards and redeploy face down.  
  - Each player draws 5 new city cards (one of each color).  
  - The starting player card passes to the left.  
- **End of Game**:  
  The game ends after several rounds, when **at least one player** reaches or passes the red "12" space on the scoring track (i.e., has a score of 12 or lower, since scoring is negative).  
- **Winner**:  
  The player with the **highest score** (least negative) wins. In case of a tie, there are multiple winners.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place tracks not directly connected to my network?**  
  No. All track placements must be adjacent to your existing network (starting marker or prior tracks).  
- **Can I place two tracks on double-line routes in one turn?**  
  No. Only one track can be placed per turn on double-line routes.  
- **Do I have to complete my network in one turn?**  
  No. The network can grow over multiple turns. The round ends as soon as it is fully connected, even during another player’s turn.  
- **What if two players complete their network at the same time?**  
  The game ends immediately when the first player completes their network. If it happens during another player’s turn due to shared tracks, the round ends after the current action.  
- **Are city cards reused each round?**  
  Yes. After each round, all city cards are reshuffled and redealt.
