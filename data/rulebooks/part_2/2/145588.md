## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The goal of Citrus is to earn the most victory points by strategically building and harvesting plantations on a shared board. Players expand their agricultural empire by purchasing plantation tiles, managing income through harvesting, and using special landscape tiles to gain advantages. Points are scored by harvesting regions, claiming Finca bonuses, and collecting valuable landscape tiles. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins. In case of a tie, multiple players share the victory.

### 3. Setup  
**Choose Game Variant:**  
- **Long Game (recommended for 4–5 players):** Use the larger board side.  
- **Short Game:** Use the smaller board. Remove 5 tiles (3 without wells, 2 with wells) from each color. Use only 3 starting Fincas (A, B, C). Remove building site tiles A, B, C, L, M, N, O.  

**General Setup:**  
1. Place the board and plantation market.  
2. Shuffle landscape tiles face-down; place one face-up on each landscape space on the board. Remove extras.  
3. Shuffle 15 Finca tiles into a face-down stack. Draw the top 4 and place them on building sites A–D.  
4. Place building site tiles: Remove A–D, shuffle the rest, place top 3 face-up on their matching spaces.  
5. Fill the market: Place 12 random plantation tiles from the bag onto the market in numerical order.  
6. Each player takes:  
   - A player mat  
   - 6 workers of one color  
   - A money marker starting at 6 coins  
   - Place 5 workers on the mat; 1 worker starts on 0 of the score track  

**Starting Player:** The player who can dance the Flamenco best begins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a turn, a player must choose **one** of two actions:  
1. **Build**  
2. **Harvest**  

Passing is not allowed unless no legal action is possible. Players may use **any number of landscape tiles** at any time during their turn.

#### A. Build Action  
- Select **one entire row** of plantation tiles from the market (any straight line of adjacent tiles, marked by arrows).  
- Pay **1 coin per tile**. If insufficient funds, choose another row or Harvest instead.  
- **All tiles in the row must be built immediately** on the board.  

**Building Rules:**  
- Plantations may be placed:  
  - Adjacent to one of your existing regions (same color).  
  - Adjacent to a Finca road to start a new region.  
- **New regions:**  
  - Must be a **different color** than any other plantation adjacent to that Finca’s roads (except in Family variant).  
  - Place your **right-most available worker** on the new tile.  
- **Expanding regions:**  
  - Match color of your existing region.  
  - No additional worker needed.  
- **Merging:**  
  - You may merge two of your own same-color regions. Return one worker to the **left-most free space** on your player mat.  
  - You may merge with a **neutral region** (unowned, from prior harvests) **only if your region is at least as large** before the merge.  
- **Prohibited:**  
  - Building on rocks or Finca building sites (A–O).  
  - Merging with another player’s region (even if same color).  

**Events During Building:**  
- **Landscape Tile Underneath:**  
  - Take the tile and place in front of you:  
    - **Wild Horses:** Place face-down. Worth points equal to horse count at game end.  
    - **Action Tile:** Place face-up. Can be used immediately or later.  
- **Market has ≤3 tiles after purchase?**  
  - Immediately:  
    1. Draw top Finca tile and place on **one** of the 3 visible building sites.  
    2. Remove that building site tile.  
    3. Draw new building site tile and place on matching space.  
  - Then:  
    1. Place your purchased plantations.  
    2. Refill market from bag to 12 tiles (in numerical order). If bag is empty, leave market incomplete.  

#### B. Harvest Action  
- Choose **one or more** of your plantation regions to harvest.  
- For each harvested region:  
  - Score **1 point per tile**.  
  - Score **+1 extra point per tile with a well** (i.e., 2 points per well tile).  
  - Return the worker to the **left-most free space** on your player mat.  
- Plantation tiles **stay on the board** but become **neutral** (unowned).  
- After harvesting, receive **income** based on number of workers now on your mat:  
  - 1 worker: 2 coins  
  - 2 workers: 4 coins  
  - 3 workers: 6 coins  
  - 4 workers: 7 coins  
  - 5 workers: 8 coins  
- Move money marker accordingly. **Maximum 12 coins** – excess is forfeited.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Scoring a Finca (During Game)  
A Finca scores **at the end of a turn** if **all 8 surrounding spaces** (orthogonal and diagonal) are occupied by plantations, landscape tiles, or rocks.  

- Count **total plantation tiles** in each player’s **adjacent regions**.  
  - If a player has multiple adjacent regions, **sum their sizes**.  
- **1st Place:** Player with most total adjacent tiles → receives **higher value** on Finca tile.  
- **2nd Place:** Player with next highest → receives **lower value**.  
- **Ties:**  
  - **Tie for 1st:** All tied players get **full 1st-place points**; **no 2nd-place points awarded**.  
  - **Tie for 2nd:** All tied players get **full 2nd-place points**.  
  - **Only one player adjacent:** That player gets **only 1st-place points**.  
- **Flip Finca tile face-down** to mark as scored.  

#### Landscape Tile Actions  
All landscape tiles may be used **at any time during your turn**, including the turn they are acquired.  

| Tile | Effect | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Wild Horses** | Place face-down. Worth points equal to horse count at game end. | Not scored during game. |
| **Money (2 or 3 coins)** | Immediately gain coins. Excess beyond 12 is lost. | One-time use. |
| **Cart** | Take **one** plantation from market for **free** and build immediately. | Discard after use. |
| **Bull** | Place on **any unoccupied space** (not rock or landscape tile). Can help complete a Finca ring. Can be **reused** when a plantation is built on its space. | **Never discarded** – stays in game. |
| **Bridge** | Build a plantation **on a rock** or **on a neutral plantation**. If neutral region is larger than 1 tile, your plantation must be **different color**. | Discard after use. |
| **Milestone** | Triggers: Add a new Finca, refill market, draw new building site. | Simulates market ≤3 rule. Discard after use. |
| **Plow** | Take control of a **neutral region of 1–2 tiles**. Place one of your workers on it. | Discard after use. |
| **Storehouse** | Store **one** plantation tile bought this turn for later use. May build it only during a **Build action**, and **only if also building at least one new tile from market**. With multiple Storehouses, store multiple tiles. | **Reusable** – not discarded. **Not worth 1 point** at end. |
| **Large Well** | When you build a plantation **adjacent** to this tile:  
  - Immediately score that region (1 pt/tile, 2 pts/well tile).  
  - Gain **+2 bonus points**.  
  - Return your worker and earn income.  
  - **Remove Large Well from game.** | One-time use. |

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends **when all plantation tiles have been built** (from bag and market).  

**Final Scoring Steps:**  
1. **Score All Unscored Fincas:**  
   - Only the player with the **most adjacent plantation tiles** (sum of regions) receives points.  
   - They receive the **lower value** on the Finca tile (i.e., the 2nd-place amount).  
   - **No points** for 2nd place or others.  
   - **Tie for most?** All tied players receive the **full lower value**.  
   - Flip Finca face-down.  

2. **Harvest Remaining Plantations:**  
   - All regions still with workers are harvested:  
     - 1 pt per tile  
     - 2 pts per tile with a well  
   - Return workers to player mats.  
   - **No income** is earned at this stage.  

3. **Score Landscape Tiles:**  
   - **Wild Horses:** 1 point per horse (as shown).  
   - **Unused Action Tiles:** 1 point each (except Storehouse and Bull).  
   - **Storehouse:** Not worth points.  
   - **Bull:** Not worth points (but remains in play).  

**Final Score:** Sum all points. Highest score wins. **Ties result in shared victory.**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use multiple landscape tiles in one turn?**  
  Yes, any number, in any order, during your turn.  

- **What happens if I can’t pay for a full row?**  
  You cannot buy it. If you mistakenly take it, return tiles to market in order and lose **3 points per tile**.  

- **Can I build on a landscape tile?**  
  Yes. Take the tile and use its effect.  

- **Can I use a Storehouse tile to build without buying anything from the market?**  
  No. You must build **at least one tile from the market** during the same Build action.  

- **Can I merge with a neutral region larger than mine?**  
  No. Your region must be **at least as large** before the merge.  

- **Can two players have adjacent regions of the same color?**  
  Yes, if they are **not connected** (i.e., separate regions). But they cannot merge.  

- **What if the bag is empty and market has ≤3 tiles?**  
  Still trigger Finca placement **if possible** (via Milestone or normal rule), but market cannot be refilled.  

- **Can the Bull be placed on a space that already has a landscape tile?**  
  No. The Bull must go on an **unoccupied space** (no rocks, no landscape tiles).  

- **Is the Storehouse worth 1 point at game end?**  
  No. Unused action tiles are worth 1 point **except** Storehouse and Bull.  

- **Can I use a landscape tile before, during, or after building?**  
  Yes. Full flexibility during your turn.
