  - 3 players: Use 4 sea regions  
  - 2 players: Use 3 sea regions  
- **Starting Ships**:  
  - Each player receives 1 random sailing ship ("clipper") and 1 random steamship from stack 1 (income £30, years 1870–1873).  
  - The player with the oldest clipper becomes the starting player and takes the Start Player Card.  
- **Initial Deployment**:  
  - Place SCOTIA (neutral ship) in North Atlantic (New York).  
  - Each player places their initial clipper in a separate sea region (excluding SCOTIA’s region).  
  - The initial steamship is placed in the player’s personal supply (not yet deployed).  
- **Docks Setup (by player count)**:  
  - 4 players: Docks start empty  
  - 3 players: Docks start with 9 steamships (1 per stack 1–9)  
  - 2 players: Docks start with 18 steamships (2 per stack 1–9)  
- **Starting Money**: £100 per player  
- **Action Cards**: Each player receives a starting hand (exact composition not specified; assumed balanced).  
- **Ship Market**:  
  - First 6 ships from the deck are placed on the Ship Market track.  
  - Leftmost ship is not removed during setup purchases.  
- **Extension Card Display**:  
  - 5 action cards (Extension Cards A/B) are laid face-up in a display.  
  - No duplicates allowed; replace any duplicate immediately.  
  - Shuffle discard pile when deck runs out.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise, each playing **one action card per turn**.  
- Played cards are placed face-up in front of the player (stacked; last card visible).  
- Most actions require deploying a ship from personal supply if possible.  
- When playing **Director** (or **President** in variant), player:  
  1. Returns all played cards to hand (must have at least 4 cards including Director).  
  2. Gains bonus marker(s) if returning 6+ (1 marker) or 8+ (2 markers) cards.  
  3. Immediately plays one card from the display and executes it.  
  4. Refreshes display: leftmost card discarded, others shift left, refill with 2 new cards.  
- **Director Token**: Can be used once per game to copy any card in the display (instead of playing a card). Token is then discarded.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Ship Market & Purchasing  
- Cost = Ship’s red price + position cost on market.  
- After purchase (1 or 2 ships):  
  - Leftmost remaining ship moves to **docks**.  
  - Remaining ships shift left.  
  - Empty spaces refilled from deck.  
- **Variant (flip-side market)**: No additional costs. Only ships bought from first 3 positions start with 1 coal.  

#### Deploying Ships  
- New ships enter regions **by age**: newest on top.  
- Normally, must be **newest ship** in region to deploy.  
- **Exception**: In North Atlantic (New York), may deploy as **2nd newest**.  
- When a ship enters:  
  - All older ships shift down.  
  - If region is full, oldest ship is **pushed out**.  
- Pushed-out ship:  
  - May redeploy to another region (if eligible).  
  - If not, it makes **one final transport** (if it has coal), then is **scrapped** and scored immediately.  
- Purchased ships not deployed immediately go to **personal supply**.  
- Ships in personal supply can be deployed later via anchor-marked action cards.  

#### Blue Riband  
- Awarded **immediately** when a player deploys a ship in North Atlantic that sets a **new speed record** (highest knots; tie does not count).  
- Place Blue Riband marker on player board.  
- Only way to gain Blue Ribands.  

#### Transporting with Ships  
- Steamships must spend **1 coal** to transport.  
- Clippers do not need coal and always can transport.  
- Income collected from bank:  
  - Base: green income value on ship.  
  - **CARGO**: up to £300 based on tonnage.  
  - **CRUISE**: £10 per 100 passenger capacity.  
- **Trade House Bonus**:  
  - When transporting in a region with your Trade Houses, gain **1 VP per ship × number of your Trade Houses** in that region.  

#### Action Cards (Base & Extension)  
| Card | Effect |  
|------|-------|

  - Exchange contracts: 3 per marker (freight/mail/passenger/coal).  
  - Leftover contracts: £20 each. |  

#### Headquarters  
- Appear on market after last steamship.  
- Can buy:  
  - 1 ship + 1 HQ, or  
  - 1 HQ alone, or  
  - 2 HQs at once (**new rule**).  
- **HQs never go to docks**.  
- Purchased HQs go to personal supply; scored at end like ships.  
- Count for flag scoring and FLEET.  

#### Docks  
- Ships moved to docks from leftmost market position when ships are purchased.  
- **Docks are public** and sorted by flag.  
- At endgame, each ship (and HQ) scores **extra VPs** based on number of matching-flag ships in docks (same for all players).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End Trigger**: After any player buys the **last steamship** from the market.  
- Complete current round.  
- Play **one final round**.  
- Then final scoring.  

#### Final Scoring  
All VPs tallied on Victory Point Chart (1 marker per 50 VPs).  
Winner is player with most VPs. **Tiebreaker**: player with newest (latest year) ship wins.  

**Sources of VPs**:  
1. **Ship & Headquarters Score** (main source):  
   - Base VPs: determined by **highest filled row** in matching **flag column** on player board.  
   - Bonus VPs: **+1 VP per matching-flag ship in docks** (public).  
   - Example: 3 green ships, base 10 VP each, +1 dock bonus → 3 × (10 + 1) = 33 VP.  
2. **Trade Houses**:  
   - Multiply:  
     - Number of Trade Houses in regions with **at least 1 of your captains**,  
     - × Number of captains in regions with **at least 1 of your Trade Houses**.  
   - Ignore houses/ships in regions without the other.  
3. **Player Board Rows**:  
   - Each **complete row** of markers:  
     - 1st row: 5 VP  
     - 2nd row: 10 VP  
     - 3rd row: 15 VP  
     - 4th row: 20 VP  
   - **Incomplete rows**:  
     - Markers in **first incomplete row**: score row number in VP each (e.g., row 2 = 2 VP each).  
     - Markers in lower incomplete rows: ignored.  
4. **Cash**: 1 VP per **£100** (round down).  
5. **FLEET Card**: Scored **during game** — 2 VP per steamship with **different flag**.  
6. **Transport + Trade Houses**: Scored **during game** — 1 VP per ship × number of Trade Houses in region.  

#### Overfilled Player Board Columns  
- If a column is full but more markers are earned, place them **under the board**.  
- Each such marker gives **1 additional VP** for that flag at endgame.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you deploy a ship that can’t enter any region?**  
  Yes, but it stays in personal supply until it can be deployed. It scores at endgame.  
- **Do scrapped ships go to docks?**  
  No. Scrapped ships are removed from the game and **do not enter docks**.  
- **Can you play Director with only 3 cards played?**  
  No. Must have **at least 4 cards** (including Director) to use it.  
- **What if no cards in display can be copied by Ship Agent?**  
  You may still copy any of the last actions played by others (not in display).  
- **Do Headquarters count for Trade House scoring during transport?**  
  No. Only **active ships in regions** can transport and trigger Trade House VPs.  
- **Can you win multiple Blue Ribands?**  
  Yes. Each time you set a new speed record in North Atlantic, you gain one.
