### 1. Lore & Objective
The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history, during which players seek to expand their power and fame by influencing Pharaohs, building monuments, farming along the Nile, and advancing civilization—all in honor of the Sun God Ra. The objective is to earn the most victory points over three epochs.

### 2. Components
- 1 game board  
- 1 Ra figure  
- 5 dice (each showing symbols: Sun, Pharaoh, Nile, Civilization, Monument, Ankh)  
- 92 wooden cubes (player markers)  
- 4 summary/crib cards  

### 3. Setup
- Place the board in the center. Position the Ra figure on the orange Sun track space matching the number of players (2, 3, or 4).  
- Each player takes a set of markers in their color and a summary card.  
- Each player places:  
  - One marker at the start of the green Pharaoh track  
  - One marker at the start of the blue Nile track  
- Determine the starting player. That player places a scoring marker on space 10 of the score track. The next player uses space 11, then 12, and so on clockwise.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game is played over **three epochs**. Play proceeds clockwise, starting with the initial player.

On a turn:
1. **Roll and Place Suns**:  
   - Roll all five dice.  
   - Immediately place all dice showing **Sun** on the next available spaces in front of the Ra figure on the Sun track (one die per space).  
   - If no spaces remain, place excess Sun dice beyond the end.  
2. **Reroll Remaining Dice**:  
   - Reroll any non-Sun dice (up to two rerolls allowed).  
   - After each reroll, place any new Sun dice on the Sun track as above.  
3. **Apply Remaining Dice**:  
   - Use the remaining dice (including Ankhs) to activate actions in any order. Each die may be used only once.  

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Pharaoh Track (Green)
- Each **Pharaoh** die advances your marker 1 space (max 12).  
- If at least one Pharaoh die is used, any **Ankh** may also be used to advance the marker.  

#### Nile Track (Blue)
- Each **Nile** die advances your marker 1 space (max 12).  
- If at least one Nile die is used, any **Ankh** may also be used to advance.  
- **Flood the Nile**: If you have **three Nile symbols** (Nile dice or substituted Ankhs), you may instead place a **flood marker** on top of your Nile marker. You may do this multiple times.  

#### Civilization Area (Multi-colored)
- With **3 Civilization dice**, place 1 marker in the Civilization area.  
- With 4 or 5 Civilization dice, place 2 or 3 markers respectively.  
- **Ankh** may substitute as a Civilization die **only if at least one actual Civilization die is used**.  
- To place on a **color space**, the die must show Civilization (not Ankh) of that color.  
- Each player may place **only one marker per color space**.  
- Each space holds a maximum of **(number of players – 1)** markers.  

#### Monument Area (Multi-colored columns)
- With **1 Monument die**, place 1 marker on any empty space of the matching color.  
- To place a **second marker**: need **two additional dice** (Monument + Monument, or Monument + Ankh).  
  - Must be in a **column without your existing markers**.  
  - The new space must match the color of a **Monument die** (not Ankh).  
- For a **third marker**, repeat the same two-die requirement and placement rules.  
- **Ankh** may substitute as Monument only if a real Monument die of that color is used.  

#### Ankh Symbol
- An **Ankh** can substitute for Pharaoh, Nile, Civilization, or Monument, **but only one use per die**.  
- **Two Ankhs together** may be used to score **2 immediate points** instead of substitution.  

#### Ra / Sun Track
- **1 or 2 Sun dice** on the track: Advance the Ra figure that many spaces.  
- **3 Sun dice**: Score **3 points** (do not move Ra).  
- **4 or 5 Sun dice**: Do **not move Ra**, but may declare a **Disaster** of your choice:  
  - **Pharaoh**: All others retreat 2 spaces on Pharaoh track (min 0).  
  - **Nile**: All others remove one flood marker. If only one flood marker, instead retreat 2 spaces (min 0).  
  - **Civilization**: All others remove two of their Civilization markers (or one if they have only one).  
  - **Monuments**: All others remove two of their Monument markers (or one if they have only one).  

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Epoch Scoring
An epoch ends when the **Ra figure reaches or passes the last space** on the Sun track. The current player finishes their turn, then scoring occurs.

- **Pharaoh Track**:  
  - Highest marker: **+5 points**  
  - Lowest marker: **–2 points**  
  - Ties: All tied players receive the same result.  
  - If all tie: no scoring.  
  - After scoring:  
    - +5 scorers move marker **2 spaces back**  
    - –2 scorers move marker **1 space forward**  

- **Nile Track**:  
  - Players with **one or more flood markers** score the **value of the space** their marker is on.  
  - Then, **remove all flood markers**, leaving only the base marker.  
  - Players with **no flood markers** score nothing.  

- **Civilization Area**:  
  - Score based on **number of markers** placed:  
    - 0 markers: –5  
    - 1 or 2 markers: 0  
    - 3 markers: +5  
    - 4 markers: +10  
    - 5 markers: +15  
  - After scoring, **all Civilization markers are removed**.  

- **Monuments**:  
  - **Not scored during first two epochs.**  
  - Scored **only at the end of the third epoch**.  
  - Two scoring categories:  
    - **Number of columns with at least one marker**:  
      - 0–6 columns: 0–6 points  
      - 7 columns: 10 points  
      - 8 columns: 15 points  
    - **Bonus per column with 3 or more of your markers**:  
      - 3 markers: +5  
      - 4 markers: +10  
      - 5 markers: +15  

After scoring:
- Return Ra figure to starting position.  
- The player who triggered the end of the epoch passes the dice to the next player, who begins the next epoch.  
- All markers **remain in place** except:  
  - Civilization markers (removed)  
  - Nile flood markers (removed)  

#### Game End
After the **third epoch is scored**, including final Monument scoring, the game ends. The player with the **most points** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use Ankhs flexibly?**  
  Yes, but each Ankh die can only be used **once**—either as a symbol substitute or as part of a pair for 2 points.  
- **Can I flood the Nile multiple times?**  
  Yes. Each time you meet the 3-symbol requirement, you may place another flood marker.  
- **Can I score Civilization points in all three epochs?**  
  Yes. Civilization is scored each epoch, and markers are removed afterward.  
- **What happens to Monument markers between epochs?**  
  They **stay on the board** and accumulate. Scoring occurs only at the end.  
- **Can I use more than one Ankh in Monument placement?**  
  Yes, but only one per "additional" placement, and the color must come from a real Monument die.
