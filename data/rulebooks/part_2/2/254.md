### 5. Core Mechanics
#### 5.1 French Dominance
France is not initially dominant. To gain dominant land power status:
1. France not in instability/fiasco zones
2. Control all home provinces with no enemy presence
3. Bonaparte B leader in play and has won ≥1 combat
4. Score 17+ points in New Political Combinations step (March 1801 or later):
   - +1 per minor district controlled (free of enemy)
   - +1 per French victory with Bonaparte B
   - +1 if France dominant on political chart
   - +1 if at peace with all majors
   - + last two digits of year (e.g., +1 for 1801)

Effects: Infantry morale ↑ to 4.0, money ↑ by 10, Bonaparte B → Napoleon A.
