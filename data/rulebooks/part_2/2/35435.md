## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Nefertiti is a strategic board game set in ancient Egypt, where players compete to gain the most prestige points by collecting and managing gift cards, influencing markets, and recruiting powerful characters. The goal is to score the most points through market dominance, gift collection, and character abilities before the game ends.

2. Components  
- Market tiles (Gizeh, Akhet-Aton, Abou Simbel, Louqso, Memphis)  
- Servant tokens (in player colors)  
- Gift cards (e.g., necklace, statuette, mirror, harp, chair, double senet, papyrus, Solar Barge)  
- Deben coins (currency)  
- Character cards (e.g., Vizier, High Priest, Thief, Merchant, Royal Servant, Scribe)  
- Royal Seals  
- Dice (2 standard dice and 1 single die)  
- Market Closed tile  
- Reserve areas for each market  
- Draw deck of gift cards, including the Akhenaton card  

3. Setup  
- Place all market tiles in their designated locations.  
- Shuffle the gift card deck and place it face-down. Insert the Solar Barge gift randomly among 4 gift cards above the last 5 cards of the deck.  
- Place the Akhenaton card as the second-to-last card in the deck.  
- Shuffle and stack Character cards:  
  - Scribe pile: ordered with +3 on top, then +2, then +1 (4 total)  
  - Royal Servant pile: 2 cards stacked  
  - Merchant pile: First Merchant (x2) on top, then 2 regular Merchants  
- Each player starts with a supply of Servants and may have starting Deben depending on player count (not specified).  
- Place Deben reserves and Royal Seals near the board.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, they perform exactly two actions in order:

1. **Play a Character (Optional)**  
   - Spend 1 Royal Seal to recruit a Character from the top of its pile.  
   - Immediately resolve its ability.  
   - Discard the Character card after use (except Roaming Thief, which returns to market).  

2. **Place a Servant**  
   - Place 1 Servant on an empty space in any open market stall.  
   - If the player is the first to place in that market, take 1 Deben from its Reserve.  
   - Some spaces grant immediate benefits:  
     - Deben symbol: take 1 Deben  
     - Single card symbol: limits card choice when market closes  
     - Extra card symbol: highest bidder may take an extra card  
   - After placement, check if the market closes based on its specific condition.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Market Closing Conditions:**  
  - **Gizeh:**  
    - Left: 4 or more connected Servants (orthogonal only)  
    - Right: 3 Servants of different colors OR any 4 Servants  
  - **Akhet-Aton:**  
    - Left: At least 1 Servant on each row  
    - Right: 3 Servants in a line (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)  
  - **Abou Simbel:**  
    - Left: Sum of bid values equals 11, 14, or ≥17  
    - Right: Sum of bid values ≥17  
    - Ties resolved from right to left  
  - **Louqso:**  
    - Left: Roll 2 dice when placing; market closes if any die matches a square number with a Servant  
    - Right: Roll 1 die; market closes if roll ≤ length of longest chain of connected Servants  
    - If not closed, keep dice; re-roll at end of next turn  
  - **Memphis (Foreign Goods):**  
    - Add red-circled Foreign Gifts as drawn.  
    - Closes when it has 4 or more gifts OR when the Akhenaton card is drawn.  
    - Always stays open until one of these triggers occurs.  

- **Market Closing Procedure:**  
  1. **Highest Bidder Pays:**  
     - Pays Deben equal to their bid space value to the market’s Reserve  
     - Chooses one of:  
       - 2 gift cards of choice  
       - 1 gift card + 1 Royal Seal  
     - Special spaces modify this:  
       - Single card: may take only 1 gift (Royal Seal still allowed)  
       - Extra card: may take an additional gift from lower row  
  2. **Other Players (in bid order):**  
     - May take:  
       - 1 gift card matching their bid space, paying its value to Reserve  
       - OR half the Deben in the Reserve (rounded down)  
  3. **Close the Market:**  
     - Slide the Market tile to cover the current stall  
     - Place "Market Closed" tile on the newly revealed stall  

- **Character Abilities:**  
  - **Vizier:** Score 2 points per different gift type held (gifts not discarded)  
  - **High Priest:** Place an extra Servant. If the first closes a market, second must be elsewhere. If out of Servants, close a market where you have a Servant (1 per missing Servant)  
  - **Thief (Chief):** Take any gift (even with Royal Seal) from the market with the Market Closed tile  
  - **Treasurer (Cresurer):** Take up to 4 Deben from any single market’s Reserve  
  - **Merchant:** Exchange 1 gift with another player. Must already own at least one of the type received. If giving lower max-value gift, pay difference in Deben. First Merchant allows two exchanges.  
  - **Royal Servant:** Choose a gift type. All players discard one of that type and score its current value. Remaining cards of that type increase in value.  
  - **Scribe:** Choose a gift type you hold. Score all of that type at current value + bonus (based on Scribe’s caste: +3, +2, or +1). Discard all scored gifts. Double senet counts as 2 gifts.  
  - **Oracle:** Look at last 5 cards in draw pile. Exchange your gifts with any of these (only if lower value). Reorder the 5 cards. Akhenaton card not considered a gift.  
  - **Beggar:** For each market, take 1 Deben from its Reserve OR turn 1 gift face-down (cannot be traded/bought/stolen; revealed when market reopens)  
  - **Merchant of Amon:** Discard any number of gift cards. Score 8 points per gift. Double senet counts as 2.  
  - **Priest of Amon:** At end of game, score bonus points based on final ranking (e.g., 1st = X pts, 2nd = Y pts)  
  - **Royal Scribe:** Same as Scribe, but choose any gift type (not necessarily held). Score with bonus, discard gifts.  
  - **Roaming Thief:** Take the lowest max-value gift from any market (not Akhenaton market). Replace it with this card. Players may "buy" the Roaming Thief when market closes, returning it to their hand for reuse.  
  - **Trader:** Exchange up to 2 gifts with the board. Pay difference in value to the market’s Reserve.  

- **Papyrus Rule:** Whenever a papyrus card is bought, stolen, or exchanged on the board (not with another player), the player takes the Royal Seal from the Papyrus location and the card.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when the Akhenaton card is drawn.  
- Final scoring includes:  
  - Standard gift card values based on quantity held  
  - Character abilities that trigger at endgame (e.g., Priest of Amon)  
  - Solar Barge: Worth 2 points per gift card the player has  
- Player with the most prestige points wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Multiple Markets Close on Same Turn:** Resolve in any order, but each market’s closing is independent.  
- **Roaming Thief Usage:** Can only be used on markets without the Akhenaton card. When taken, it replaces the gift; next player may acquire it during closing.  
- **Ties in Bid Sums (Abou Simbel):** Resolved from right to left on the bid track.  
- **Scribe Scoring:** Bonus applies per card scored. Double senet counts as 2 cards. Other players do not score.  
- **Gift Value Increase:** When a player discards a gift type via Royal Servant, the value of remaining cards of that type increases for all players.  
- **Memphis Closure:** Triggers either by accumulating 4+ foreign gifts OR drawing Akhenaton card.  
- **Oracle and Akhenaton:** Oracle cannot exchange with Akhenaton card, which is not a gift.  
- **Deben Payments:** Always paid to the market’s Reserve unless otherwise specified.
