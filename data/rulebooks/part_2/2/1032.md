## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players assume command of a B-17 Flying Fortress during World War II bombing missions over Europe. The objective is to successfully reach the target, bomb accurately, and return safely to base. The mission is considered complete upon landing in England. Survival of the aircraft and crew determines success, with damage, crew injuries, and environmental hazards posing constant threats.

2. Components  
- B-17 counter  
- Mission Chart (Flight Log)  
- Crew Placement Board  
- Damage tables (P-1 to P-6, BL-1 to BL-4)  
- Combat tables (M-1 to M-6, B-1 to B-7)  
- Flak tables (O-1 to O-5)  
- Landing tables (G-9, G-10)  
- Fire extinguisher counters (5 in play)  
- Various markers (formation, damage, fire, oxygen, etc.)

3. Setup  
1. Determine target city using Mission Chart (G-1, G-2, G-3).  
2. Roll for B-17 position in formation (G-4).  
3. Roll for squadron position (G-4).  
4. Consult Flight Log (G-11) for zone details.  
5. Place B-17 counter in Zone 1.  
6. Position 5 fire extinguisher counters near starboard waist on Crew Placement Board.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Flying to Target:  
   - Move B-17 one zone closer to target.  
   - Roll for fighter cover (G-5).  
   - Roll for number of attacking waves (B-1).  
   - Resolve air combat for each wave.  
   - Repeat until entering Target Zone.

2. Entering Target Zone & Bombing Run:  
   - Roll for weather over target (O-1).  
   - Roll for fighter cover (G-5).  
   - Roll for attacking waves (B-1).  
   - Resolve air combat.  
   - Roll for flak (O-2, O-3).  
   - Resolve flak damage.  
   - Roll for bomb run accuracy (O-6).  
   - Turn B-17 for return.

3. Flying Home:  
   - Move B-17 one zone closer to home.  
   - Repeat combat procedures.  
   - In Zone 1, roll for weather over England.  
   - Resolve landing (G-9 or G-10).  
   - Resolve crew and B-17 disposition (BL-4, BL-5).

5. Core Mechanics  

Air Combat (per wave):  
1. Roll 2d6 on B-3 to determine attacking fighters and directions.  
2. Roll on M-4 for fighter cover defense (if applicable).  
3. Assign defensive fire from available gun positions (M-1).  
4. Optionally roll on M-6 for German pilot status (Ace: +1 to hit, Green: -1 to hit).  
5. For each B-17 hit, roll on M-2 to determine fighter damage:  
   - 1-2: FCA (Fighter damaged, continues at -1)  
   - 3-4: FBOA (Fighter damaged, breaks off after attack at -2)  
   - 5-6: Fighter destroyed  
   - 2+ FCA = FBOA; FCA + FBOA = FBOA; 2+ FBOA = Destroyed  
6. Resolve German offensive fire (M-3):  
   - Roll 1d6 per fighter; consult attack direction tables (B-5) for hit location.  
   - Apply modifiers: Ace +1, Green -1, evasive action -1 for attackers, defensive fire may require 6 to hit.  
7. For each shell hit, roll on B-5 to determine area damaged.  
8. Roll on appropriate P-table (P-1 to P-6) and BL-tables for specific damage and crew injuries.  
9. Roll on B-6 for successive attacks; repeat combat steps if applicable.

Flak:  
- Roll on O-2 to determine flak level (Light, Medium, Heavy).  
- Roll 2d6 three times on O-3 to determine number of flak bursts.  
- For each hit, roll 2d6 on O-4 to determine shell hits or BIP (Burst Inside Plane).  
- For each shell hit, roll 2d6 on O-5 to determine affected area.  
- Resolve damage using P and BL tables.

Aborting:  
- Optional after any combat resolution.  
- Mandatory if:  
  - 2+ engines out  
  - Bomb bay doors, intercom, or Norden sight inoperable  
  - Heat or suit heater inoperable for one or more crew  
  - Bombardier KIA or seriously wounded  
  - Navigator KIA or seriously wounded and B-17 out of formation  
  - Oxygen out for one crew member (forces drop to 10,000 ft)  

Oxygen/Fire:  
- Two shell hits to oxygen system knocks it out; B-17 must drop to 10,000 ft unless vacancy allows staying in formation.  
- Fire requires immediate crew assignment to fight it; 3 attempts allowed on BL-3 (1d6 per attempt).  
- If not extinguished, crew must bail out (G-6).

Evasive Action:  
- Only allowed when out of formation.  
- Attacking fighters subtract 1 from die roll (6 still hits).  
- Defensive fire must roll 6 to hit (Ace bonus still applies).  
- Not allowed if: in formation, 2+ engines out, control cables out, landing modifiers ≥3 negative, non-pilot/copilot flying, or damage prohibits it.

Borrowing Ammo:  
- Gun positions may borrow ammo in 2-burst increments.  
- Twin mounts (Ball, Top, Tail) may only borrow from other twin mounts.  
- Only allowed when no fighter waves present or after all fighters driven off.

Wounded Crew:  
- Seriously wounded crew cannot perform actions.  
- Crew may be moved during "safe" turns or if intercom works.  
- Moving during combat: cannot fire until after one wave resolves.  
- Gunners moving to new position hit only on 6 (Ball and Top, Waist gunners interchangeable without penalty).  
- Engineer takes over flying if Pilot and Copilot out; others may take over with landing penalties.  
- Dead/wounded crew placement: 2 in waist, 1 in radio room, 1 in pilots' compartment, 2 in bomb bay (if bombs gone).

Engine Status:  
- One engine out: jettison bombs to stay in formation; out of formation otherwise.  
- Two or three engines out: jettison bombs, drop to 10,000 ft, spend 2 turns per zone, fighters +1 to hit, no evasive action.  
- One engine operating: fly one more zone, then crash or bail out; may throw overboard equipment to fly 2 more zones. Landing roll -3.  
- No engines: crash land (G-9/-7 or G-10/-4) or bail out (G-6 or G-8).

Heat Out/Frostbite:  
- B-17 may travel one more zone; then must descend to 10,000 ft or risk frostbite (1d6: 1-3 frostbite, 4-6 none).  
- Frostbitten crew hit only on 6.  
- After landing, roll for effects: 1-3 serious injury/amputation, 4-6 recovers.  
- Frostbitten + seriously wounded: +1 to survival roll.

Landing:  
- In England: roll on G-9.  
- In Europe: roll on G-9, -3 to roll (crash landing, B-17 lost).  
- In Sea: roll on G-10; crew rescued (zones 2-5) or captured (6-7).  
- No landing modifiers for 1 or 2 engines out.  
- Landing gear damage: additional roll for irreparable damage (1-3 reparable, 4-6 irreparable).

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when the B-17 lands or is destroyed. Success is measured by:  
- Completing the bombing run (on target preferred).  
- Surviving crew members (wounded crew roll on BL-4 for survival).  
- Returning B-17 condition (reparable or irreparable).  
- Campaign play: completing 25 missions.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can crew voluntarily bail out over England?  
  A: Yes, before dangerous landing (G-6).

  A: Roll 1d6: 1-4 original occupant, 5-6 additional man.  
- Q: Does tail gunner have special rules?  
  A: Yes, can fire at passing fighters from 10:30, 12, 1:30 with intercom working.

- Q: Can B-17 with no engines glide?  
  A: No, must crash or bail out immediately.  
- Q: Is flak affected by weather?  
  A: No, but bombing is.  
- Q: Can Engineer fly the plane?  
  A: Yes, must be first replacement if Pilot/Copilot out.
