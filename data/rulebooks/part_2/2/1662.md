## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Napoleon: The Waterloo Campaign, 1815 is a wargame simulating the final confrontation between Napoleon’s French forces and the Allied armies under Wellington (Anglo-Dutch) and Blücher (Prussian). The French player aims to defeat both Allied armies or occupy two of three key supply cities (Ghent, Brussels, Liege) by June 22nd. The Allies win by defeating the French army or surviving until time expires.

**Victory Conditions:**
- **French Victory:** Both Allied armies are defeated (Anglo-Dutch: ≥8 units lost; Prussian: ≥9 units lost), or French occupy any two of Ghent, Brussels, or Liege after their turn on June 22nd. A simultaneous defeat of all three armies results in a French win.
- **Allied Victory:** French army is defeated (≥12 units lost), or no French victory occurs before time expires.

### 2. Components
- Game map with towns and roads (major/minor)
- Wooden blocks representing units (French, Anglo-Dutch, Prussian)
- Battle boards and terrain markers (Woods, Farm, Stream, Hill)
- Dice
- Leader blocks (Napoleon, Wellington, Blücher)
- Square and Disrupted markers (optional)

### 3. Setup
- **Allied Deployment:** Anglo-Dutch and Prussian units deploy first in Belgium, north of the Franco-Dutch border.
  - Anglo-Dutch: West of dashed line; max 4 units per town.
  - Prussian: East of dashed line; max 4 units per town.
- **French Deployment:** Deploy in French towns; max 12 units per town.
- After initial setup, no stacking limits apply in any town.
- **Historical Note:** To avoid overstacking, deploy some units in adjacent towns during setup.
- **3-Player Variant:** One player controls French, one Anglo-Dutch, one Prussian. Allied players may only discuss strategy during initial deployment and Allied night turns.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Turn Order: French → Allied → Night Turn → Repeat  
Each turn consists of the following phases:
1. **Movement**
2. **Forced Marches**
3. **Skirmishes**
4. **Battles**
5. **Allied Supply (Fr turns only)**
6. **Defeat Check**
7. **Victory Check**
8. **Disrupted Units Recover**

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### (1) Movement
- **Activation Limits:**
  - French: 2 groups per turn
  - Anglo-Dutch: 1 group per turn
  - Prussian: 1 group per turn
- **Movement Range:**
  - Infantry & Foot Artillery: 1 town
  - Cavalry, Horse Artillery, Leaders: 2 towns
- Units may pass through friendly units but stop upon entering enemy-occupied towns.
- **Road Limits:**
  - Major roads: 8 units per turn
  - Minor roads: 6 units per turn
  - Halved when attacking across rivers (4/3)
- **Group Attack Restriction:** Two groups may not attack the same enemy group unless all three groups started the turn connected by road (forming a "triangle").
- **Night Movement:** Normal movement allowed, but no attacks or forced marches.

#### (2) Forced Marches
- Occurs after regular movement.
- Units may move one additional town (may attack).
- Roll 1 die per unit:
  - 1–3: Lose 1 step
  - 4–6: No effect
- **+1 bonus** if unit started the turn with a revealed leader (leader need not move with them).

#### (3) Skirmishes
- Triggered when either side has fewer than 3 units in a contested town.
- Resolved before battles; attacker chooses order.
- Each player reveals up to 4 units (must reveal at least 1, limit is 4).
- **Combat:**
  - Defender fires first, then attacker.
  - Firepower:
    - Cavalry, Horse Artillery, Leaders: F2
    - Infantry, Foot Artillery: F1
  - No long-range fire or shock bonuses.
- **Retreat:**
  - Player with fewer total units (including unrevealed) must retreat.
  - Tie: attacker retreats.
  - Retreating units become **Disrupted** (no rout attrition).
- Victorious units may **reinforce** an adjacent battle but **cannot regroup**.

#### (4) Battles
- Occur in towns with opposing units and ≥3 units per side.
- Multiple battles resolved simultaneously: attacker chooses sequence.
  - Both players deploy all battle boards.
  - Each takes one turn in battle #1, then #2, etc.
  - Repeat until all battles resolved.

##### Battle Setup
- **Terrain Selection:**
  - Attacker draws and places 1 terrain tile.
  - Defender draws and places 2 terrain tiles.
  - For third simultaneous battle: defender draws both remaining tiles; attacker gets none.
- **Terrain Types:**
  - **Woods:** Infantry normal; Cavalry stop upon entry, fire at F1 (no shock); Artillery cannot enter, deploy, or fire into.
  - **Farm:** 1 Infantry only; fires at +1 (F2→F3); Cavalry cannot attack.
  - **Stream:** Placed between opposing positions; max 2 units may cross per battle turn (excess eliminated); Artillery cannot cross (Horse Artillery can if position is vacant).
  - **Hill:** 1 Artillery only; fires long-range at +1.
- **Deployment:**
  - Defender deploys first, then attacker.
  - Minimum 1 unit per position (Left, Center, Right); any number in Reserve.
  - **Corps Integrity:** Only units of one corps per position (two corps if leader present).
    - Allied leaders (Wellington/Blücher) allow one Anglo-Dutch and one Prussian corps in their position (morale bonus only for own army).
  - Units deployed upright (hidden); reveal all except Reserve and Woods.
  - Optional rule: units remain hidden until they fire or become engaged.

##### Battle Turn Sequence
Each battle turn consists of:
1. **Morale Check**
2. **Combat (Move/Fire/Retreat)**
3. **Reinforcements**

###### 1. Morale Check
- Roll 1 die for each **engaged, non-sheltering, 1-step unit**.
  - 1–3: Must disengage (if in square or Foot Artillery, eliminated)
  - 4–6: No effect
- **+1 bonus** if leader in same position or unit in square.
- **Leader morale:** Only rolls if alone in position (gets +1).

###### 2. Combat

  - Sheltering leader still provides morale bonus

**Squares:**
- Formed/broken with SBM
- Cannot move or disengage
- Not allowed in Woods or Farms
- Can form while engaged
- Infantry in square: +1 morale, fires normally
- Targeting a square:
  - Cavalry: fire at F1, no shock
  - Infantry: fire at +1
  - Artillery: long-range +1; Horse Artillery short-range F3 (first fire only)

**Fire:**

###### 3. Reinforcements

#### (5) Allied Supply (French Turns Only)

  - Brussels occupied → Anglo-Dutch lose 1 unit
  - Liege occupied → Prussian lose 2 units
- Allied player chooses which units are lost.

#### (6) Defeat
- Check after all combat:
  - Anglo-Dutch: defeated if ≥8 units lost
  - Prussian: defeated if ≥9 units lost
  - French: defeated if ≥12 units lost
- Remove all units of defeated army.

#### (7) Victory Check
- Conducted after Defeat Check.
- French win if both Allied armies are defeated or occupy any two of Ghent, Brussels, Liege after June 22nd French turn.
- Allies win if French are defeated or time expires without French victory.

#### (8) Disrupted Units Recover
- All disrupted units (face-down) are turned upright and may act normally next turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Victory is determined by army elimination or territorial control, not point scoring.
- Game ends immediately when:
  - French meet victory conditions
  - Allies meet victory conditions
  - Time expires

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Simultaneous Battles:** Players alternate full turns across all active battles. Order chosen by attacker.
- **Rout:** Occurs when any friendly position is solely occupied by enemy. All units must retreat; those unable to are eliminated. All routed units suffer attrition:
  - Infantry & Horse Artillery: -1 step
  - Foot Artillery: -2 steps
  - Cavalry: -1 step only if engaged with enemy cavalry
  - Leaders: 0
- **Stalemate:** If attacker does not engage, fire, or retreat for 2 consecutive battle turns (after all reinforcements), must immediately retreat all units (rout attrition applies to engaged units).
- **Retreat Road Limits:** Apply to both voluntary retreats and routs in the same battle turn. Do not reset.
- **Regrouping:** Only after a **battle** (not skirmish). Winner may:
  - Add units from adjacent towns to victory town, **OR**
  - Move units from victory town to adjacent friendly towns
  - Subject to 2 (major)/1 (minor) road limits
  - Units available to reinforce adjacent battles
- **Leaders:** 
  - Blücher commands only Prussian units
  - Wellington commands only Anglo-Dutch units
  - Provide +1 morale if in same position
  - May force march at +1 bonus (risk elimination)
