## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
While no explicit lore is provided, the game centers on strategic resource management and development in a gem-mining and estate-building theme. The objective is to earn the most victory points (VP) by constructing buildings, acquiring forests, collecting gems, and advancing on development tracks.

2. Components  
- Market strips (dark brown and light brown)  
- Coins  
- Diamonds  
- Player boards with light green spaces (track progression)  
- Pit, Mining Rights, and Ship components  
- Buildings: fountains, orangeries, pavilions, rose gardens  
- Forests  
- Animal tiles (pond, deer park, aviary, individual animals)  
- Bonus cards  
- Development tracks: Technology and Money  
- Starting player track  
- Price board  

3. Setup  
- Shuffle dark brown and light brown market strips separately.  
- Set out as many market strips of each color as there are players.  
- Each player receives their player board and starting resources (exact quantities not specified in source).  
- Determine starting player.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows 5 phases:  
1. **Set out market strips**: Shuffle dark brown and light brown strips separately. Lay out a number of each equal to the player count.  
2. **Buy**: Players simultaneously place coins on market strips. The price of a space increases by 1 for each adjacent coin (including opponents’).  
3. **Assign diamonds**:  
   - One diamond is awarded to the player who placed the most coins (tie-breaking method not specified).  
   - One diamond is awarded to the current leader on the starting player track.  
4. **Purchase gems**:  
   - Players form combinations using their Pit, Mining Rights, and Ship values.  
   - The number of gems acquired equals the lowest value among the three components.  
   - Bonus pieces on the "Technology" track may increase this amount (exact bonuses not detailed).  
5. **Build**:  
   - Players may buy buildings (fountains, orangeries, pavilions, rose gardens) and forests.  
   - The cost is increased by 1 for every opponent's piece present on the price board.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Area control / influence**: Coin placement on market strips is affected by adjacency, creating spatial competition.  
- **Set collection**: Gem acquisition depends on balancing Pit, Mining Rights, and Ship values.  
- **Economic development**: Players invest in buildings and forests, which contribute to scoring.  
- **Track advancement**: Progress on Technology and Money tracks provides VP and potential bonuses.  
- **Simultaneous action selection**: Coin placement appears to be simultaneous.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End**: The game ends immediately after the round in which one player fills all 14 of their light green spaces. That round is completed in full.  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - Fountains, orangeries, pavilions, rose gardens: 4 VP each  
  - Forests: 2 to 6 VP each (value depends on position on development track)  
  - Each triple combination (pond, deer park, aviary): 10 VP  
  - Individual animal tiles: 1 VP each  
  - Bonus cards: VP equal to imprinted value (1 to 3 VP)  
  - Technology and Money development tracks: VP based on level reached (1 to 3 VP, exact scale not specified)  
- **Winning**: Highest total VP wins. In case of a tie, the tied player with the most gems wins.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Tie in coin count during diamond assignment**: Source does not specify tiebreaker for most coins; assume standard tie rules or first-player priority.  
- **Simultaneous coin placement**: Since adjacency affects price, strategic positioning relative to opponents is critical.  
- **Gems from combinations**: Only the lowest of Pit, Mining Rights, and Ship values counts, but Technology track bonuses may increase final gem count.  
- **Price board**: Opponents' presence increases building/forest cost by 1 per piece.
