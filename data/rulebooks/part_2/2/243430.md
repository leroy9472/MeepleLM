## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The goal of Checkered Combos (Krass Kariet) is not to lose all of your chips. Players compete over multiple rounds to be the first to empty their hand of cards. The last player with cards at the end of a round must lose a chip. If a player must lose a chip but cannot (has none left), they lose the game, and all other players win.

2. Components  
- 48 numbered cards (values 1–12, 4 of each)  
- 6 special cards:  
  - 1 X-Card (wild card)  
  - 2 Stop Cards  
  - 2 Redraw Cards  
- Chips (at least 2 per player; 3 recommended for longer games)  

3. Setup  
- The oldest player deals.  
- Give each player:  
  - 2 chips (or 3 for a longer game)  
  - 10 cards (7 cards if 5 players)  
- Players must pick up all dealt cards at once and fan them out **without changing the order**.  
- Deal 2 face-up reserve cards to each player.  
- Place remaining cards face-down as a draw pile in the center.  
- The player to the left of the dealer starts the first turn.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- A **Round** consists of multiple **Turns**, played clockwise.  
- A **Turn** begins with one player opening and ends when all players have either played a combination or taken a reserve card.  
- A **Round ends** when:  
  - One player is the last to still have cards in hand at the end of a turn, OR  
  - A player cannot outbid and has no reserve cards left.  
- After a round ends, chips are lost, and a new round begins with fresh card deals.  

5. Core Mechanics  
**Hand Structure**  
- Players may not rearrange the order of cards in their hand at any time.  
- Cards can only be played if they are adjacent in the hand (1, 2, or 3 adjacent cards).  

**Card Combinations (Ranked from lowest to highest):**  
1. **Solo**: One card  
2. **2-straight**: Two cards of consecutive values (e.g., 5–6; order in hand does not matter)  
3. **Pair**: Two cards of the same value  
4. **3-straight**: Three cards of consecutive values (e.g., 4–5–6)  
5. **Trips**: Three cards of the same value  

**Outbidding Rule**  
- After the opening play, each subsequent player must either:  
  - Play a higher-ranked combination, OR  
  - Play the same type of combination with a higher total value (e.g., Pair of 8s beats Pair of 5s)  
- Combinations must be formed from adjacent cards in hand.

**On Your Turn, You Must Do One of the Following:**  
a) Play a valid, outbidding card combination (1–3 adjacent cards)  
b) Take one of your face-up reserve cards and insert it anywhere in your hand  
c) If you cannot or choose not to outbid and have no reserve cards, you **lose a chip**  

**Special Cards**  
- **X-Card**:  
  - Acts as a wild card (value 1–12, declared when played)  
  - Can be part of a combination (e.g., X-6-7 as 5-6-7)  
  - When played: Turn ends immediately, you win the turn  
  - Winner of the turn draws 3 cards (added to hand in any positions)  
- **Stop Card**:  
  - Played alone (not in combination)  
  - Ends the turn immediately and wins it  
  - No card drawing effect  
- **Redraw Card**:  
  - Played alone  
  - Ends your turn; next player must outbid the previous combination or take a reserve card  
  - If you win a turn in which **one** Redraw Card was played: draw 3 cards  
  - If **two** Redraw Cards were played: draw 6 cards (3 per Redraw)  
  - Cards drawn are added one at a time to any position in hand  
  - You may still draw even if you just emptied your hand  
  - If you open with Redraw Card: next player may play any combo or take reserve  
  - If all players take reserve or play second Redraw, you win the turn  

**Winning a Turn**  
- The player who played the highest combination wins the turn.  
- If the winner has no cards left:  
  - The player with the second-highest combination starts the next turn  
  - If no other player played: the winner’s right-hand neighbor starts  
- All played cards are discarded.  
- Winner of the turn starts the next turn.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End of Round Triggers**:  
  - One player is the last with cards in hand  
  - A player cannot outbid and has no reserve cards  
- **Chip Loss**:  
  - The player(s) who trigger the end of the round lose one chip  
  - If multiple players are left with no cards after the final turn, all players in that turn lose a chip **except** the turn winner  
- **New Round Setup**:  
  - All cards are collected, shuffled, and redealt (same setup as initial)  
  - The player(s) who lost a chip in the prior round:  
    - If one: they start the next round  
    - If multiple: the oldest player starts  
- **Game End**:  
  - A player who must lose a chip but has none left **loses the game**  
  - If multiple players cannot lose a chip simultaneously, they all lose  
  - All remaining players win

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I rearrange my hand?**  
  No. The order of cards in hand must remain unchanged throughout the game. You may only insert reserve cards anywhere you choose.  
- **Can I play a combination that wraps around (e.g., 12-1-2)?**  
  No. Straights must be of consecutive numbers (e.g., 10-11-12), but wraparounds (12-1-2) are not valid.  
- **Can I play a solo with a Stop Card and still outbid?**  
  Yes. Stop Card is played as a solo and immediately wins the turn, regardless of prior combinations.  
- **What if I play the last card(s) from my hand but win a Redraw effect?**  
  You draw the specified number of cards and continue in the round.  
- **Can two Stop Cards be played in one turn?**  
  Yes, but only one can be used per player per turn (only 2 exist). The first Stop Card ends the turn immediately.  
- **What if all players take reserve cards in a turn?**  
  The player who opened the turn wins it and starts the next turn.
