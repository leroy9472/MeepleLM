## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Space Cadets: Dice Duel is a real-time, team-based dice-rolling game of starship combat. Two teams control opposing starships, each with six key stations: Engineering, Helm, Weapons, Sensors, Shields, and Tractor Beams. The objective is to destroy the enemy ship by inflicting four points of damage using torpedoes or mines. The game is played in continuous real time—there are no turns—until one ship is destroyed.

2. Components  
- Shared Components:  
  - 1 Game Board  
  - 2 Starship Plastic Miniatures  
  - 6 Purple Acrylic Crystals  
  - 12 double-sided Asteroid/Nebula/Wormhole Tokens  
  - 1 Rulebook  

- Per Starship Components:  
  - Engineering Station Display + 6 White Energy Dice  
  - Helm Station Display + 3 Yellow Helm Dice  
  - Sensors Station Display + 4 Green Sensor Dice  
  - Weapons Station Display + 6 Red Weapon Dice  
  - Shields Station Display + 3 Blue Shield Dice  
  - Tractor Beam Station Display + 3 Orange Tractor Beam Dice + 2 Mine Tokens  

3. Setup  
- Divide players into two equal teams. Each team sits together, with Engineering centrally located.  
- Each team takes one of each station display and associated dice. Place two mine tokens on each Tractor Beam display.  
- Place starship miniatures on their starting squares. Place one crystal on each of the six numbered crystal squares on the map.  
- Teams alternate placing Asteroid and Nebula tokens on the map. Wormholes are optional and not used in first games.  
- Assign stations:  
  - 2 Players: Player A (Helm, Shields, Tractor Beams), Player B (Weapons, Sensors), Engineering shared.  
  - 3 Players: Player A (Helm, Shields, Tractor Beams), Player B (Weapons, Sensors), Player C (Engineering).  
  - 4 Players: Same as 3-player, plus a Captain (no station, coordinates team).  
- Begin when someone says "BEGIN!"—Engineering starts by rolling Energy dice.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- No turns. Players act simultaneously and continuously.  
- Engineering rolls Energy dice and sends them to stations by number:  
  - 1 → Weapons  
  - 2 → Sensors  
  - 3 → Shields  
  - 4 → Helm  
  - 5 → Tractor Beams  
  - 6 → Must be re-rolled (no station)  
- When a station receives Energy dice, players may roll an equal number of Station dice. After placing Station dice on their display, return the Energy dice to Engineering.  
- Certain actions ("Fire 1", "Fire 2", "Tractor", "Warp Jump") pause the game. Resolution occurs immediately, then play resumes.  
- The game ends when one ship accumulates four damage points.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Engineering: Generates Energy dice. Rolls and rerolls freely. Sends dice to stations by number. Returns Energy dice after Station use.  
- Helm: Uses Helm dice to move the ship. Dice show movement and turning. Must place all three dice (A, B, C) before moving. Movement order: A → B → C. After move, dice are removed.  
  - Obstacles:  
    - Asteroid: Remove 2 Shield dice (all if <2).  
    - Nebula: Remove 2 Sensor dice (all if <2).  
- Weapons: Loads torpedoes using one Nose, one Body, and one Tail die per torpedo. Two tubes (front/rear), max two torpedoes loaded.  
- Sensors:  
  - Weapon Lock: Dice with Lock icons generate Lock points.  
  - Jammers: Dice with Jammer icons generate Jammer points to block enemy locks.  
- Shields: Four sectors (Front, Right, Back, Left). Shield dice protect from torpedoes hitting that side. Multiple dice can be placed per sector.  
- Tractor Beams:  
  - Tractor Beam strength = sum of Tractor icons rolled.  
  - To capture a crystal or move enemy ship: strength ≥ 2 × range (non-diagonal).  
  - Capturing a crystal: Remove it from map, no pause.  
  - Moving enemy ship: Shout "Tractor!" to pause game. Move enemy to any adjacent square (including diagonals). Apply obstacle effects immediately.  
  - Mines: Roll Mine A or B die to activate. May deploy mine at ship’s current location (not during movement). Only one mine per space. Mines cause 1 damage (no shield block) when entered. Torpedoes destroy mines.  
- Crystals: Gained by successful tractor beam on map crystals. Used for:  
  - Station Override (1 crystal): Place any Station die on desired face without rolling or energy.  
  - Warp Jump (1 crystal): Shout "WARP JUMP!" to pause game. Roll 2 Energy dice. Move ship to crystal space matching one die result (same facing). May spend more crystals to roll more dice and choose.  
  - Energy Surge (2 crystals): Replace one damaged Energy die with a crystal (damage level unchanged). Return Energy die to pool.  
  - After next torpedo launch, used crystals (except on damage track) return to map via die roll.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Damage is scored via torpedoes or mines. Each point of damage removes one Energy die and places it on the Damage Display.  
- A ship is destroyed when it suffers 4 damage.  
- Torpedo Damage Resolution:  
  A. Check Hit:  
    1. Enemy in front or rear arc.  
    2. Torpedo loaded on corresponding side.  
    3. Attacker’s Lock ≥ Range + Enemy’s Jammer points.  
  B. Check Damage:  
    1. Identify hit shield sector. Diagonal hits target stronger shield; tie → defender chooses.  
    2. 0 shields: 1 damage per torpedo.  
    3. 3 shields: No damage.  
    4. 1 or 2 shields: Weapon Officer rolls one die per torpedo.  
      - 1 Blast: Penetrates 1 shield.  
      - 2 Blasts: Penetrates 2 shields.  
  C. Clean-Up:  
    - Remove all Weapon dice for launched torpedoes.  
    - Remove all Lock dice.  
    - Remove enemy Jammer dice (if attack was in arc).  
    - Remove shield dice from hit sector (if torpedoes hit).  
- Mine Damage: Any ship entering a mine space takes 1 damage. Mine is removed. No shield block.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can both ships occupy the same square? Yes. The moving ship occupies the half near its entry edge; the other ship is pushed to the opposite half.  
- Can I launch torpedoes diagonally? Yes. Hit direction determines which shield is targeted. Equal shields → defender chooses.  
- Can I tractor a crystal from any direction? Yes. Facing doesn’t matter.  
- Can I use a crystal during a paused action? Yes, but only if declared before or during the pause.  
- What happens if I roll a 6 on Energy dice? Must reroll. No station for 6.  
- Can I fire without Lock? No. Even at range 0, Lock must exceed Jammer + Range.  
- Can I save Helm dice via gravity arrows (in tile play)? Yes. Moving with a gravity arrow saves one Helm die to Energy section. Moving against A or B die cancels C die.  
- Can I launch a mine while moving? No. Only after movement is complete and ship is stationary.  
- Can I tractor an enemy ship with no Tractor Beam dice? No. Must have dice placed and sufficient strength.  
- Can I use Station Override on any die? Yes, any Station die (Helm, Sensors, etc.), but not Energy dice.
