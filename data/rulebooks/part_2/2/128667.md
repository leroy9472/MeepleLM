## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Samurai Sword*, players take on secret roles aligned with one of three factions: the Shogun and Samurai team, the Ninjas, or the Ronin (who plays alone). The objective for each team is to either gather the most Honor Points or be the last team standing.

The game ends immediately if one or more players run out of Honor Points.

### 2. Components
- Character role cards (Shogun, Samurai, Ninja, Ronin)
- Player cards (Weapon cards, Action cards such as Battle Cry and Jujutsu)
- Resilience Points tracker
- Honor Points tracker
- Reference materials (this rule set)

(Note: Specific quantities not provided in source.)

### 3. Setup
- Assign secret team roles based on player count:
  - Samurai: Number depends on total players
  - Ninjas: 2 or 3, depending on player count
  - Ronin: Always one; plays independently
- Each player receives starting Resilience Points and Honor Points (exact starting values not specified).
- Shuffle card deck and deal initial hands (exact starting hand size not specified, but players draw 2 per turn).

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each player’s turn follows four mandatory phases in order:

1. **Recover**: If you have 0 Resilience Points, recover all of them.
2. **Draw**: Draw 2 cards.
3. **Play**: Play any number of cards from your hand, following card-specific rules.
4. **Discard**: Discard down if holding more cards than allowed (maximum hand size not specified, but excess must be discarded).

Play proceeds clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Harmless Characters
A player is "Harmless" if:
- They have 0 Resilience Points, **or**
- They have no cards in hand.

While Harmless:
- Cannot be targeted by Weapon cards.
- Unaffected by Action cards *Battle Cry* and *Jujutsu*.
- Not counted when calculating Attack Difficulty.
- Otherwise remains in play.

#### Attack Difficulty
- The Difficulty to attack another character is the minimum number of seats between the attacker and target, measured clockwise or counterclockwise.
- Harmless characters are skipped (not counted) when determining this distance.

#### Defeating a Player
- When a player loses their last Resilience Point, they are “Defeated!”
- The defeated player must give 1 Honor Point to the player who caused the defeat.
- Defeated players remain in play unless eliminated by Honor Point loss.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- The game ends immediately if any player has 0 Honor Points.
- Victory is awarded to the team that:
  - Has the most Honor Points, **or**
  - Is the last team with members still in play.

Individual team goals:
- Shogun and Samurai: Cooperate to maximize team Honor and survive.
- Ninjas: Work together (secretly) to outmaneuver others.
- Ronin: Wins individually—must maximize personal Honor or survive alone.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Q: Can I recover Resilience Points if I still have some?**  
  A: No. Recovery only occurs during the Recover phase if you have 0 Resilience Points.

- **Q: What happens if the player who defeats me has no Honor Points?**  
  A: The defeated player still gives 1 Honor Point to the attacker. (Assumed standard transfer; no blocking.)

- **Q: Are Harmless players skipped for all targeting purposes?**  
  A: Only for Weapon cards, Battle Cry, Jujutsu, and Attack Difficulty calculation. Otherwise, they are fully in play.

- **Q: Can the Ronin win even if on zero Honor Points?**  
  A: No. Game ends immediately if any player has zero Honor Points. Ronin must retain Honor to stay in contention.
