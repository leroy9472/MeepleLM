### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build without placing a helper?**  
  Yes. Placing helpers is optional and costs taler.

- **Can I use Silver Ingots directly for building?**  
  No. Silver must be exchanged 1:1 at the Forge for another resource.

- **Can I refuse to sell to the Stonemason?**  
  No. If a player played a Worker and the Stonemason buys, the sale is mandatory. But the Stonemason cannot take the last resource.

- **Can I place a helper on a building I didn’t build?**  
  Yes, as long as the building is constructed and the copper space is unoccupied.

- **What happens if all carts are taken in the Trader phase?**  
  Place helper on the horse. If the horse is taken, replace another player’s helper (they get theirs back).

- **Can I play the Master Builder without any buildings being built?**  
  Yes, but you gain 0 VPs if no buildings were built.

- **Can I place two helpers on different buildings in one turn?**  
  Yes, up to 2 helpers, each on a different building, if you built and pay the cost.
