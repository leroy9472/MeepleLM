## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Casus Belli is a two-player strategy game based on the mechanics of *Antike*, reimagined for direct conflict between Rome and Carthage. Players compete to gain the favor of ancient personages—historical figures such as Generals, Kings, and Scholars—by advancing on the Victory Point (VP) track. The first player to reach 9 personages (VPs) wins the game.

### 2. Components  
#### From the Casus Belli Kit:
- 1 game board (featuring Rome and Carthage starting cities)
- 25 event cards (to be cut if necessary)
- 1 rulebook

#### From Original Antike (Required):
- **Personages (21 cards):**
  - 2 Navigators  
  - 4 Citizens  
  - 4 Generals  
  - 5 Scholars  
  - 6 Kings  
- **Resources:**
  - Marble, Iron, Gold (resource units)  
  - Coins  
- **Markers:**
  - 12 black disks: town walls  
  - 12 blue disks: Iron city markers  
  - 12 grey disks: Marble city markers  
  - 10 yellow disks: Gold city markers  
  - 12 Temples  
- **Wooden Bits (in green and red):**
  - 12 Legions (each color)  
  - 12 Galleys (each color)  
  - 25 round wooden disks (for VP tracking and control)  
  - 6 octagonal stones: 1 for the rondel center, 5 for Know-how ownership

> Note: Only 12 temples should be used. Wooden bits from original *Antike* may be used, but temple count must be limited.

### 3. Setup  
- Each player receives:
  - 3 Marble, 3 Iron, 3 Gold
  - 1 town wall (black disk) in personal supply
- Starting player is determined randomly. The non-starting player receives 1 coin as compensation.
- Place one round wooden disk per player at **0** on the VP track.
- **Recruitment Boxes:**
  - Roma (Green): 1 green legion + 1 green galley
  - Carthago (Red): 1 red legion + 1 red galley
- **Starting Cities (Square Cities):**
  - Roma (Green): Roma (Gold), Genua (Marble), Cremona (Iron)
  - Carthago (Red): Carthago Nova (Gold), Caesarea (Marble), Carthago (Iron)
- Place resource markers:
  - Blue (Iron): Cremona, Carthago
  - Grey (Marble): Genua, Caesarea
  - Yellow (Gold): Roma, Carthago Nova
- Place colored control disks (green/red) on each starting city.
- Shuffle the 25 event cards and place them face-down as a draw pile. Reveal the top 3 to form the **open card supply**.
- Place the octagonal rondel stone in the center of the rondel.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn, a player performs **one action** from the rondel. The player’s game stone moves clockwise around the rondel. On the first turn, any field may be chosen. On subsequent turns:
- The player may choose any of the next **3 fields** for free.
- Advancing further costs **1 resource (Marble, Iron, or Gold)** per additional field.

Turn order proceeds until a player reaches **9 personages** on the VP track.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### **SCIENTIA (Know-How Acquisition or Recruitment)**  
Players may:
- **Acquire a Know-How**, paying gold. The first player to acquire each Know-How pays the higher cost and gains a **Scholar**.
- **Recruit military units:**
  - Legion: 1 Gold → placed in recruitment box
  - Galley: 2 Gold → placed in recruitment box
- Units never leave the game; defeated units return to the recruitment box.

**Know-How Effects:**
- **Strata (Roads):** Legions move up to 2 regions.
- **Navigatio (Navigation):** Galleys move up to 2 regions.
- **Moneta (Currency):** +1 to total production of each resource.
- **Res Publica (Republic):** Defense strength of each city +1.
- **Commodium (Trade):** Trade 3 resources to the bank for 2 of your choice (any type, not coins). Can be used at any time during your turn (except during acquisition).

Players may do one or both (e.g., recruit and gain a Know-How) if they can afford it.

#### **MILITIA (Arming Units)**  
- Only units in the recruitment box can be armed.
- Cost: **2 Iron per unit** (legion or galley).
- A maximum of **1 armed unit per city** unless a temple is present (up to 3 per city with temple).
- Arming adds unit to a city on the board.

#### **DUELLUM (Maneuver)**  
1. **Movement:**
   - Legions move across land (red borders), Galleys across sea (blue borders).
   - Base movement: 1 region; increased to 2 with **Strata** or **Navigatio**.
2. **Combat:**
   - In any region with opposing units: legions cancel legions 1:1, galleys cancel galleys 1:1.
   - Remaining units proceed.
3. **Conquest:**
   - After all movement and combat, conquer cities.
   - **Defense Strength = 1** (+2 if temple present, +1 for town wall, +1 for Res Publica, +1 per defending military unit in city).
   - Attacker must have **more units** than the city's defense strength.
   - Attacker loses number of units equal to defense strength; defender loses all units in the city.
   - **City conquest destroys town wall** — returns to owner’s supply.
   - Control disk is replaced with attacker’s color.
   - All defeated units return to their recruitment boxes.

> All units in a region may participate in conquest, even if they already moved.

#### **TEMPLUM (Temple or Town Wall Construction)**  
- **Temple:**
  - Cost: **6 Marble** + **1 coin per adjacent temple** (own or opponent’s).
  - Built one at a time; cost increases during turn if multiple are built.
  - Grants ability to station up to 3 military units in the city.
- **Town Wall:**
  - Cost: **1 Marble**
  - Defense +1 for the city.
  - Only one per city.
  - Must be built from player’s personal supply (earned via VP milestones or starting supply).

#### **Founding Cities**  
- Only allowed in regions with a **city symbol**.
- Cost: **1 Marble + 1 Iron + 1 Gold**
- Choose production type (Iron, Marble, or Gold) → place corresponding marker (blue, grey, yellow).
- Place your colored disk on top.
- **Additional cost: 1 coin per adjacent city (any player) producing the same resource.**

> Example: Founding a Gold city adjacent to two existing Gold cities (any owner) costs 2 extra coins.

#### **Fields for Production (MARMOR, FERRUM, AURUM)**  
- At the end of your turn, collect:
  - 1 resource per own city producing that type
  - +2 more if a temple is in that city
- Additionally, receive **1 coin** per production field (city) you control.

> Example: A Marble city with a temple produces 3 Marble + 1 coin.

#### **Personages & Scoring**  
- Gain a personage by meeting the requirements on personage cards (e.g., control X cities, have Y units, own Z Know-hows).
- When a player gains a personage:
  - Advance VP marker by 1.
  - Opponent takes **1 event card** from the open supply.
  - Open supply is immediately replenished to 3 cards.
- **No bonus personage** for acquiring all 5 Know-hows (unlike some editions of *Antike*).

#### **Event Cards**  
- Open supply: 3 face-up cards.
- Opponent draws 1 card when:
  - You gain a personage (1 card per personage)
  - You conquer 1 or more cities in a single maneuver turn (1 card total, not per city)
- Cards may be played **during your turn**, except **"Fortress"**, which is played **during opponent’s maneuver**.
- **"Fortress" effect:** Defender may force attacker to spend **1 additional unit** for conquest. If attacker cannot, conquest fails.
- All event cards are **discarded after single use**.

#### **Navigator**  
- Requirement: Control 7 sea regions (indicated by galley symbol).
- Sea regions without cities count **double** toward this goal.
- Example: 4 galleys in sea regions = 8 "sea points" if all are non-city seas → sufficient for Navigator.

#### **VP Track & Town Wall Bonuses**  
- Town wall symbols at: **0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7**
- When VP marker **reaches or passes** one of these values, player gains 1 town wall to personal supply.
- Starting at 0: each player begins with 1 town wall.
- Example: Moving from 1 to 3 → gain 2 town walls.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends **immediately** when a player reaches **9 personages** on the VP track.
- That player **wins**.
- No final scoring round.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I trade during the same turn I acquire Commodium?**  
  Yes, but **not during** the acquisition action. Trade can occur later in the turn.

- **Do I get a coin for every city I control during production?**  
  Yes. Each city producing a resource gives **1 coin** in addition to its resource output.

- **What happens to adjacent temple costs when building multiple temples?**  
  Costs are calculated **sequentially**. Each newly built temple increases adjacent costs for the next.

- **Can I conquer a city with units that just moved?**  
  Yes. All units in the region may participate in conquest regardless of movement.

- **Can I use event cards outside my turn?**  
  Only **"Fortress"** may be used during opponent’s maneuver. All others are **your-turn-only**.

- **Do I get event cards if my opponent loses cities without me conquering?**  
  No. Event card gain only occurs when **you conquer** cities or **opponent gains personages**.
