### 1. Lore & Objective

Huginn is an Automa (automated opponent) for *Odin's Ravens*, designed to simulate a challenging solo opponent in the game’s first edition. Named after one of Odin’s two mythical ravens, Huginn operates without a hand or auxiliary stack and does not use the flight deck except for the "Magic Way" mechanic. The objective is to provide a solo player with a dynamic and competitive experience that mirrors a two-player game.

The Automa competes against the human player by advancing along the path, manipulating land cards, and strategically using actions to gain advantages. Victory is determined through standard *Odin's Ravens* scoring, with Huginn's performance based on final position and card control.

### 2. Components

- **Automa Deck**: A deck of cards specific to Huginn, each containing:
  - Difficulty Level (I, II, or III)
  - Card Action (effect to resolve)
  - Move Points (number of movement points Huginn has this turn)
- Unused **Flight Deck** (from *Odin's Ravens*) – used only to supply face-down cards as counters for the "Magic Way"
- **Odin Marker** – used during movement
- Optional: Die (to track cards added to the "Magic Way")

### 3. Setup

1. Use only with the **first edition** of *Odin's Ravens*.
2. Construct the Automa deck based on desired difficulty:
   - **Difficulty I**: Only Level I cards
   - **Difficulty II**: Level I + Level II cards
   - **Difficulty III**: All cards (I, II, and III)
3. Shuffle the selected automa cards to form the automa draw pile.
4. Place the automa discard pile nearby (initially empty).
5. Decide who goes first — player or Huginn. Huginn does not have a preference.
6. Place the Odin Marker in front of Huginn’s starting position if applicable (per base game setup).

### 4. Gameplay Flow

Each round proceeds in turns. On Huginn’s turn:

1. **Flip an Automa Card**  
   Reveal the top card of the automa deck and place it on the discard pile.

2. **Resolve Card Action**  
   Execute the action described on the card.  
   - If the action involves manipulating a land card, it only succeeds if the target land is **unoccupied**.  
   - If the action is illegal or impossible, skip it.

3. **Move Huginn**  
   Spend all available Move Points (listed on the card) in the following ways:
   - Remove the Odin Marker in front of Huginn: **1 point**
   - Move forward one space: **1 point**
   - Move forward across multiple identical land types (e.g., several Forests in a row): **1 point total**

4. **Proceed to Next Turn**  
   Alternate turns with the human player until the round ends.

5. **End of Round**  
   - Return all cards Huginn added to the "Magic Way" to the unused flight deck or remove them from play.
   - **Do not reshuffle** the automa deck. Start the next round with the discard pile as-is (no reset).

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Card Action Resolution
- Actions may include adding cards to the "Magic Way", manipulating land cards, or other effects.
- All actions assume legal targets exist.
- If no valid target or condition is met, the action is skipped.

#### Magic Way Mechanic
- When instructed, take a **face-down card from the unused flight deck** and place it beside the "Magic Way" card.
- This serves only as a **counter** (tracks how many times Huginn has added cards).
- A die can be used instead for convenience.
- At the end of the round, return these cards.

#### Movement Rules
- Huginn **must use all move points** if possible.
- Movement costs:
  - Removing Odin Marker: 1 point
  - Moving forward one space: 1 point
  - Moving over multiple consecutive identical land types: 1 point (regardless of number of spaces)
- Movement is always forward only.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

- Scoring follows the standard *Odin's Ravens* rules.
- Huginn earns points based on:
  - Final position on the path
  - Control of land cards (if applicable)
  - Completion of objectives (per base game)
- Game ends when the final round concludes per base game rules.
- Compare final scores — highest score wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

**Q: What happens if the automa deck runs out?**  
A: The rules do not specify reshuffling. Once the deck is exhausted, no more automa cards are drawn. If this occurs before the game ends, Huginn cannot take further turns. (Note: This may indicate a design oversight; house rule recommended.)

**Q: Can Huginn add a card to the Magic Way if the flight deck is empty?**  
A: No. If no unused flight cards remain, the action cannot be performed and is skipped.

**Q: Does Huginn ever reshuffle its deck?**  
A: No. The automa deck is **not reshuffled** between rounds.

**Q: What if Huginn cannot move at all?**  
A: If movement is blocked and no actions can be taken, Huginn still consumes the turn — card is flipped, action attempted, move points lost if unusable.

**Q: Are house rules official?**  
A: The optional rules (e.g., increasing Odin Marker cost to 2, or charging 1 point per space moved) are **suggested house rules** for balancing difficulty, especially for new players.
