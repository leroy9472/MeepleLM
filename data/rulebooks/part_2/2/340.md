## Frank's Zoo — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Frank’s Zoo is a dynamic card-shedding game where players compete to empty their hands by playing animal sets to the Field. The game alternates between solo (Wild Rumble) and team-based (Team Rumble) rounds. The ultimate goal is to accumulate the most points over multiple rounds, with gameplay shaped by animal hierarchies, partnerships, and special card interactions.

### 3. Setup  

#### Wild Rumble (First Round)  
1. Remove all Point cards with numbers greater than player count.  
2. Set aside Team cards, Overview cards, and non-starred Point cards.  
3. Assemble starred Point cards (2–7) into a deck in ascending order (lowest on bottom). Place beside play area.  
4. Youngest player is Dealer.  
5. Dealer shuffles all 60 Animal cards and deals evenly:  
   - 4 players: 15 each  
   - 5 players: 12 each  
   - 6 players: 10 each  
   - 7 players: 8 or 9 each (last 3 get 1 fewer)  

#### Team Rumble (Subsequent Rounds)  
1. Rebuild Point deck: place each non-starred card under its matching starred card (e.g., non-star 5 under starred 5).  
2. Use Overview card for player count to assign teams:  
   - Rank players by previous round’s score (higher Point card breaks ties).  
   - Assign Team cards based on rank and Overview chart.  
3. Dealer is determined by the arrow on the Overview card (usually lowest rank).  
4. Deal all Animal cards evenly again.  

#### Option: Fast Team Start  
Skip Wild Rumble. Randomly assign Team cards. Use Overview card to determine Dealer.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

#### Turn Options (All Modes)  
On your turn, do one of the following:  
- **Lead**: If Field is empty, play 1+ cards of the same species.  
- **Pursue**: If Field has cards, either:  
  - *Outnumber*: Play same species with exactly one more card (e.g., 3 Lions on 2 Lions).  
  - *Outrank*: Play same number of cards of an outranking species (per card’s white bubble).  
- **Pass**: Skip turn. You may still play later.  
- **Collect & Lead**: If your cards are on top of Field and all others passed, collect entire Field into your Animal Stack, then Lead a new set.  

#### Special Animals  
- **Chameleon**:  
  - Can be played with any species set.  
  - Cannot be played alone (even as final card).  
- **Mosquito**:  
  - Can be led as its own set.  
  - Cannot outrank.  
  - Can play **1 Mosquito** with **1 or more Elephants** — treated as an Elephant.  
  - **Joker equivalent**: “Joker & Mosquito played alone = 2 Mosquitoes” — interpreted as a special combo rule (likely referring to variant use).  

#### Team Rumble Additions  
- **Card Swap (After Deal)**:  
  - Junior gives 2 cards face down to Senior.  
  - Senior adds them, returns 2 cards (same or different) to Junior.  
  - Grey single player places up to 2 cards face down as starting Animal Stack.  
- **Ask for Help (Junior Only)**:  
  - Junior may reveal cards from hand that can Pursue the current set.  
  - Senior may add needed cards (including Mimics) — all count as played by Junior.  
  - If denied, Junior takes cards back and **must Pass**.  
- **Going Out**:  
  - First to empty hand takes top **starred** Point card.  
  - Gives matching **non-starred** card to partner.  
  - Single player keeps both, but non-starred card is worth **4 points** (fixed).  
- **End of Round**:  
  - When only one player has cards left, round ends.  
  - Last player gets **no Point card**, and partner gets nothing.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Animal Play Rules  
- All plays must be sets of same species.  
- Mimics follow special rules (see above).  
- Only one Mosquito can be added per Elephant set.  
- Joker is not a standard component; likely refers to Mosquito combo rule.  

#### Turn Order  
- Play proceeds clockwise.  
- First turn: Dealer leads.  
- After Collect & Lead: same player leads again.  
- Skip players who are out.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Scoring by Round  

**First Hand (Wild Rumble — Solo)**  
- Last player: 0 points  
- Others: Score = (Number of players) − (Finish place) + 1  
  - Example (5 players): 1st = 5, 2nd = 4, 3rd = 3, 4th = 2, 5th = 0  

**Subsequent Hands (Team Rumble)**  
- Team score = sum of individual scores  
- Solo player (Grey): +4 point bonus  
- Individual Bonuses/Penalties:  
  - **+1 per Lion** in Animal Stack — only if at least 2 Lions collected  
  - **−1** if **no Hedgehog** in Animal Stack  
  - **−1 per Lion** left in hand — only for last player  

#### Championship Rumble (Full Game End Condition)  
- Play until **2 or more players have ≥19 points**.  
- **High score wins**.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with **fewest points at end of previous round** wins.  
  - (Note: Conflicts with Team Rumble tiebreaker; use Championship rule for final tie.)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you pass and then play later in same round?** Yes. Passing doesn’t eliminate you.  
- **Can Junior ask for help after passing?** No — only when choosing to Pursue.  
- **What if Senior can’t help?** Junior must Pass.  
- **Can you play Chameleon as last card?** Only if with another card. Cannot play alone.  
- **Do Mosquitoes count as Elephants for Lion scoring?** No — only for play mechanics. Scoring uses actual Lions.  
- **What if only two players left and one goes out?** Last player gets no Point card. Round ends.  
- **Can you Outrank with Mosquitoes?** No — they don’t outrank any animal.  
- **Is the non-starred Point card ever revealed?** Only when partner receives it or single player flips it (fixed 4 pts).
