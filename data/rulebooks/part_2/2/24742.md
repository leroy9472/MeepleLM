## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In the aftermath of World War II, the CIA and KGB engage in covert operations across global flashpoints. Players represent one intelligence agency, deploying agents to influence nations and events during the Cold War. The goal is to be the first to reach 100 Victory Points (VPs) by claiming objective cards through strategic influence and agent agendas.

### 2. Components
- 12 Agent Cards (6 CIA, 6 KGB)
- 21 Objective Cards (15 nations, 6 events)
- 24 Group Cards (6 each: Economic, Media, Military, Political)
- 2 Domination Tokens (CIA and KGB)
- 1 Balance Token
- 2 Score Cards and VP Tokens
- Rulebook / Reference Materials

### 3. Setup
1. Shuffle Objective and Group cards into separate face-down decks.
2. Each player chooses a side (CIA or KGB), takes their 6 Agent cards, Domination Token, and Score Card.
3. Stack Agent cards face down as Headquarters (HQ).
4. Place VP tokens at 0 on score tracks.
5. Assign Balance Token randomly for the first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in six phases per turn:

#### 1) Briefing
a. Flip the top Objective Card face-up to determine the current objective.  
b. Assign the Balance Token:
   - To the player with fewer VPs.
   - On tie: to the loser of the previous Cease-fire (civil disorder or lost domination).
   - If both caused civil disorder last turn, retain current owner.
   - First turn: assign randomly.  
c. Shuffle all Group cards (including discards) into a new deck.  
d. If a player used Analyst successfully last turn, they view and reorder the top 3 Group cards.

#### 2) Planning
a. Each player secretly selects one Agent from HQ as Agent X for the turn.  
b. If Double Agent was successful last turn, that player may view the opponent’s Agent X before choosing.  
c. Return all agents previously on leave to HQ.

#### 3) Influence Struggle
a. Balance Token holder decides who acts first.  
b. Players alternate taking one of the following actions until both pass consecutively:
   1. **Recruit a Group**: Draw the top Group card and place it ready in front of you. Mandatory if you have no groups.
      - Cannot exceed the Objective’s Population limit.
   2. **Activate a Group**: Mobilize one of your ready groups (turn sideways) to use its faction power:
      - **Economic**: Change the state (ready/mobilized) of any non-economic group.
      - **Media**: View the top Group card; choose to discard it, recruit it, or leave it on top.
      - **Military**: Destroy any other group (yours or opponent’s).
      - **Political**: Move any other group to your side, provided:
         - You won’t exceed Population limit.
         - Opponent’s influence ≤ Stability (unless moving to your side).
   3. **Pass**: End your turn; may act again unless both players pass consecutively.
      - Must have at least one group to pass.

#### 4) Cease-fire
a. **Domination Token Placement**:
   - Player with highest influence ≤ Stability places their Domination Token on the Objective.
   - Influence = sum of all ready and mobilized groups.
   - Tiebreaker: Compare highest-value group from the faction with the largest Bias Icon. If none, proceed to next largest.
b. **Civil Disorder**:
   - If a player’s influence > Stability:
      - Reveal and terminate their Agent X (remove from game).
      - Opponent immediately claims the Objective.
   - If both players exceed Stability:
      - Both Agent Xs are revealed and terminated.
      - Objective is placed face-down under the Objective deck (unclaimed).

#### 5) Debriefing
a. Reveal Agent X cards (if not terminated).
b. Resolve Agent Agendas in Initiative order (1 to 6). Do not resolve terminated agents.
   - **1 – Master Spy**: The side *without* the Domination Token claims the Objective.
   - **2 – Deputy Director**: No effect; survives termination and does not go on leave.
   - **3 – Double Agent**: Before next Planning phase, choose:
      - View enemy Agent X, or
      - Send one enemy agent on leave.
      - If both agents are Double Agents: only the side with Domination Token resolves.
   - **4 – Analyst**: At next Briefing, view and reorder top 3 Group cards.
      - If both are Analysts: only the side *without* Domination Token resolves.
   - **5 – Assassin**: If your side placed Domination Token, terminate enemy Agent X and place Objective under deck.
   - **6 – Director**: Win an extra Objective (claim one additional from your scoring pile).
c. If the Objective remains unclaimed, the player with the Domination Token claims it and scores its VP value.

#### 6) Detente
a. Each player’s Agent X goes on leave (placed face-up beside HQ), unless:
   - Already terminated, or
   - Agent is Deputy Director (returns to HQ).
b. Use Deputy Director power (if applicable): no effect, but survives.
c. Update scores based on claimed Objectives.
d. If any player has ≥100 VPs, they win. Otherwise, begin a new turn at Phase 1.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Agent Initiative**: Agendas resolve in order 1–6.
- **Faction Powers**: Activated when mobilizing groups.
- **Balance Token**: Grants initiative in Influence Struggle and breaks scoring ties.
- **Event Cards**: Can use special ability during appropriate phase; discard and lose VP value.
- **Leaving & Termination**:
   - Agents on leave cannot be selected next turn.
   - Terminated agents are removed permanently (except Deputy Director).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Claimed Objectives are placed in scoring pile and scored at Detente.
- First player to reach or exceed 100 VPs at the end of Detente wins.
- If both reach ≥100 VPs in same turn, higher score wins.
- If tied, play continues until one player leads at end of a Detente phase.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I pass with no groups?** No — you must recruit if you have no groups.
- **Can I recruit beyond Population limit?** No — even via Political move or event.
- **What happens to destroyed/moved groups?** Destroyed groups go to discard; moved groups retain state.
- **Tie in Bias Icons?** Continue down faction order until resolved.
- **Using Event Card Ability**: Announce during correct phase; discard after use and reduce score.
- **Double Analyst/Double Agent**: See agenda rules above.
- **Deputy Director**: Never goes on leave, survives civil disorder.
