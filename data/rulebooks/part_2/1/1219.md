### 4. Gameplay Flow  
**Turn Structure (Both Games)**:  
Each turn consists of:  
1. **Shift the maze** (mandatory)  
2. **Move your piece** (optional)  
3. **Take an action** (e.g., collect card, complete objective)  

**Labyrinth Glow In The Dark – Basic Game**:  
- Players look at the top treasure card.  
- On their turn:  
  1. Insert the spare path tile into one of the 12 edge slots (marked by arrows), sliding the row and pushing out the opposite tile.  
     - Cannot reinsert tile into the same row it was just removed from.  
     - If a player is on the pushed-out tile, move them to the newly inserted tile.  
  2. Move your piece along connected paths to any reachable tile.  
- If your piece lands on the tile matching your current treasure card, flip the card face up and draw the next one.  
- Game ends when a player collects all treasures and returns to their starting corner.  

**Labyrinth by Day and by Night**:  
- **Day Phase (lights on)**:  
  - Play as in Basic Game, collecting day treasures.  
  - Phase ends immediately when any player collects all their day treasures.  
  - Remaining uncollected day treasures are discarded.  
  - Players pick up their night treasure cards into their hands.  
  - Lights are turned off.  
  - The player to the left of the one who ended the day phase starts the night phase.  
- **Night Phase (lights off)**:  
  - Players use the same maze mechanics to collect their glowing night treasure cards (visible in the dark).  
  - On landing a night treasure tile, place the corresponding card face up.  
  - After collecting all night treasures, return to starting corner to end the game.  

**Master Wizard Labyrinth**:  
- Youngest player starts.  
- On each turn:  
  1. **Shift the maze**:  
     - Use the spare tile to push into any of the 12 edge rows (marked by triangles).  
     - Slide the row, pushing out the opposite tile.  
     - Cannot reinsert into the same row it came from.  
     - If a mini figure is on the pushed-out tile, move it to the new tile on the opposite side.  
  2. **Move your mini figure**:  
     - Move along connected corridors.  
     - Can move any distance, change direction, pass through other players.  
     - Must end on a different tile than started.  
  3. **Collect character card**:  
     - Only if you land on the character whose card is next in the revealed sequence.  
     - Place collected card face up in front of you.  
- **Wizard Wands**:  
  - Spend 1 wand to take an extra turn immediately after your current one.  
  - Only one wand per turn may be used.  
- **Trading**:  
  - Players may negotiate deals for advice (e.g., offer a wand or card).  
  - Payment only if the advised move is taken.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Maze Shifting**:  
  - A spare tile is inserted into a movable row (12 possible entry points).  
  - The row shifts, ejecting the tile on the opposite end.  
  - The ejected tile becomes the next spare tile.  
  - Cannot reverse the previous move (no reinsertion into same row).  
- **Movement**:  
  - Players move along connected paths only.  
  - No jumping or wall-breaking.  
  - Can share tiles with others.  
- **Card Collection**:  
  - **Glow In The Dark**: Collect treasures in any order.  
  - **Master Wizard**: Must collect character cards in the order revealed by the draw pile.  
- **Special Actions**:  
  - **Wizard Wands**: Grant an extra turn (spend 1 per turn). Unused wands worth 3 points.  
  - **Negotiation**: Players may barter for strategic help.
