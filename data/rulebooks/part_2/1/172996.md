## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *The King Is Dead*, the realm of Britain is thrown into chaos following the death of the monarch. Factions vie for control of regions through political maneuvering and strategic placement of followers. The goal is to emerge as the most influential player when the game ends—either by securing dominance through regional control or by uniting resistance against a Saxon invasion.

The game ends under one of three conditions:
- A single faction (Loyalist) wins control of a region (contextual; see endgame).
- Saxons win control of **four regions** (immediate end).
- **All eight regions** have been resolved (end of final power struggle).

The winner is determined based on which faction is in power and each player’s follower influence.

### 2. Components
- 8 Region Cards (representing regions of Britain)
- Region Control Tokens (Faction and Saxon)

- Supply of Followers for each faction
- Power Struggle Cards (1 per round, 8 total)

---

### 3. Setup
- **Player Count**: 2–4 players.
  - **2 players**: Remove 2 followers from each faction before setup.
  - **4 players**: Players form teams of two (opposite seats). Teammates share victory but **cannot communicate** or show cards.
- Each player receives:
  - 8 Action Cards
  - 1 Crown Token
  - Draws 2 random followers from the bag
    - In 2-player games: If both followers are the same color, redraw.
- Place home region followers:
  - Each player places 2 of their colored followers in their designated home region (Caledonia, Caerleon, or Londinium).
- Randomly place up to 4 followers in each region (from supply).
- Shuffle Action Cards and deal 8 face-down in order (1–8), one per round.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game consists of **8 rounds**, each corresponding to a Power Struggle in one region.

#### Each Round:
1. **Starting Player**: Begins the round; turns proceed clockwise.
2. **Player Turns**:
   - On your turn, choose one:
     - Play **one Action Card** (and optionally) + **take one follower** from any region (any faction).
     - **Pass**
   - Players alternate until all pass consecutively.
3. **Resolve Power Struggle**:
   - After all players pass:
     - Determine control of the current region:
       - **Faction Token**: The faction with the most followers in the region gains control.
       - **Saxon Token**: If there is a tie among factions or no dominant faction, place a Saxon Control Token.
     - Place the appropriate control token on the region.
     - **Remove all followers** from the region and return them to the common pool.
     - The **starting player for next round** rotates clockwise.

#### Action Cards:
- **Crown**: Swap positions of two Region Cards. Place your Crown Token on one to prevent it from being swapped again via Crown.
- **Garrison**: Swap two followers in one region with one follower from a bordering region (any faction). Irreversible.
- **Ambassador**: Swap one follower from any region with one follower from any other region (any faction). Irreversible.
- **Settlements**: Take one follower from **each faction** from the supply and place them into any unresolved regions.
- **Faction Card**: If your faction controls any region, take **two** followers of your faction from supply and place them in **one or two** regions bordering a controlled region.

---

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Follower Placement & Removal**: Followers are placed during setup and via card effects. They are removed during power struggle resolution.
- **Region Control**: Determined per region at the end of each round. Dominant faction (most followers) controls it, or Saxons if tied/none.
- **Saxon Invasion**: Each Saxon Control Token counts toward the invasion threshold.
- **Team Play (4 players)**: Partnerships are silent; victory is shared.
  - For **Control victory**: One player wins, both teammates win.
  - For **Invasion victory**: Combine both players’ followers when counting sets.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends when:
- **Saxons control 4 regions**, OR
- **All 8 regions have been resolved**.

#### Step 1: Determine the Faction in Power
- The faction with **most controlled regions** is in power.
- **Tie?** The tied faction that **most recently won a region** (i.e., won the latest power struggle) is in power.

#### Step 2: Determine Winner Among Players
- The player with the **most followers of the faction in power** wins.
- **Tie?** Proceed to **supporting faction**:
  - The faction with the **second-most regions** is supporting.
  - Among tied players, the one with **most followers in the supporting faction** wins.
- **Still tied?** The tied player who **last played an Action Card loses** (indecisiveness penalized).

#### Special Case: Saxon Invasion
- If **four Saxon Control Tokens** are placed at any time, the game ends immediately.
- **Winner**: The player with the **most complete sets of followers**.
  - A set = **one follower from each faction**.
  - In 4-player games: **combine teammates’ followers** to form sets.
- **Tie?** The tied player who **last played an Action Card wins** (proactivity rewarded).
