## NΣT! – Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Players compete in teams to score the most points by winning tricks and capturing loot (opponent’s 1-value cards). The game’s name, NΣT!, reflects the core mechanic: players use NY3T! tokens to eliminate options during setup, shaping the rules of each round by choosing what will *not* be allowed.

The goal is to accumulate the most points over a fixed number of rounds by strategically influencing round conditions and playing cards to win tricks.

2. **Components**  
- 5 Character cards  
- 60 Playing cards (4 colors: blue, red, yellow, green)  
  - Per color: 3 × 1, 1 × 2, 1 × 3, 1 × 4, 1 × 5, 1 × 6, 1 × 7, 1 × 8, 1 × 9, 1 × 10, 1 × 11, 1 × 12, 1 × 13  
- 32 NY3T! tokens  
- 1 Bonus card  
- 1 Gameboard  
- 1 Scorepad and pencil (not included, but required)

3. **Setup**  
- Place the gameboard and NY3T! tokens within reach.
- Choose a Character card and place it face-up in front of each player.
  - With fewer than 5 players, cover unchosen Character cards with a NY3T! token (these remain out for the game).
- Each player takes NY3T! tokens matching their character.
- **Deck size by player count:**
  - 2, 4, or 5 players: Use all 60 cards.
  - 3 players: Remove 11, 12, and 13 of each color (48 cards total).
- Choose a scorekeeper.
- Randomly select the first dealer.
- The dealer shuffles and deals cards evenly:
  - 5 players: 12 cards each
  - 4 players: 15 cards each
  - 3 players: 16 cards each
  - 2 players: 15 cards each (30 cards set aside, to be shuffled back in later rounds)

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Each round consists of two phases:

**Phase 1: NY3T! Phase**  
- Starting with the dealer and proceeding clockwise, each player places one NY3T! token on an empty box of their choice on the gameboard.
- Each line has 5 boxes; players place tokens until only one box per line remains uncovered.
- Once a line has only one empty box, no more tokens may be placed on that line.
- The uncovered box on each line determines the rule for that round.

**Phase 2: Trick Phase**  
- The player indicated by the empty box on Line 1 becomes the first player.
- The first player:
  - Chooses their team (based on player count).
  - Decides who receives the Bonus card (if applicable).
- Players discard or pass cards as dictated by Line 2.
- Play begins with the first player leading a trick.
- Players follow clockwise, playing cards according to trick rules.
- The trick winner collects the cards, places loot (if any) face-up beside their pile, and leads the next trick.
- After all cards are played, scoring occurs.

After scoring:
- Remove all NY3T! tokens from the board.
- The next player to the left becomes dealer.
- Cards are shuffled and redealt.

5. **Core Mechanics**

**Gameboard Lines & Rules**  
Each line determines a rule based on the one *uncovered* box:

- **Line 1: First Player**  
  The player whose character matches the uncovered box becomes first player. They:
  - Choose team composition.
  - Choose who gets the Bonus card (if applicable).

- **Line 2: Discard Cards**  
  Players must:
  - Discard 3 cards: discard 3 cards (no restrictions).
  - Discard 2 cards: discard 2 cards.
  - Discard 1 card: discard 1 card.
  - Except 1: discard 1 card, but not a 1-value card.
  - Pass left: give 1 card to the player on the left.

  If “NY3T!” box is uncovered: no cards are discarded.

- **Line 3: Trump Color**  
  The color of the uncovered box becomes trump for the round (blue, red, yellow, green).

- **Line 4: Supertrump**  
  The three 1-value cards in the color of the uncovered box become supertrumps.
  - If a supertrump color is selected, those 1s become *double agents*: they adopt the current trump color during play, regardless of original color.
  - If “No Supertrump” is uncovered, there are no supertrumps.

- **Line 5: Trick/Loot Value**  
  The number on the uncovered box determines how many points each trick and each loot card is worth.
  - Red numbers are negative (e.g., -2 means -2 points per trick/loot).
  - Applies equally to tricks won and loot captured.

**Trick Rules**  
- Players must follow the led color if able.
- If unable to follow suit, any card may be played (including trump or supertrump).
- If trump is led, players must play a trump or supertrump if able.
- If supertrump is led, players must play a trump or supertrump if able.

**Trick Winner Determination**  
- If no trump or supertrump is played: highest card of the led suit wins. Ties go to the last player who played that card.
- If only trumps are played (no supertrump): highest trump wins. Ties go to last played.
- If a supertrump is played: it wins the trick, regardless of value.

**Loot**  
- A 1-value card becomes *loot* only if it is played by an opponent and captured in a trick by a player on the opposing team.
- Loot is placed face-up beside the trick pile.
- A player may capture up to 3 loot cards in a single trick (if 3 opponent 1s are in the trick).
- 1-value cards played by teammates do not count as loot.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- After each round:
  - Each team counts:
    - Number of tricks won
    - Number of loot cards captured
  - Total = (tricks + loot) × point value from Line 5
  - Scorekeeper records the result (can be negative if value is red).
- **Game length:**
  - 5 players: 10 rounds
  - 4 players: 8 rounds
  - 3 players: 9 rounds
  - 2 players: 8 rounds
- Each player deals the same number of times.
- At game end, highest total score wins.
- Tie: multiple winners.

**Bonus Card Rules**  
- Used only in 3- or 5-player games.
- Awarded to a player on the smaller team (or solo player in 3-player game).
- The owner may **double their team’s score** for that round.
- First player decides who receives it (can choose themselves).

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can a supertrump lose?**  
  No. If a supertrump is played, it always wins the trick.

- **What happens if two supertrumps are played?**  
  The last one played wins (per tie-breaking rule).

- **Can I play a 1-value card of non-supertrump color as a regular card?**  
  Yes. Only the three 1s of the designated supertrump color are supertrumps.

- **What if I have no cards of the led suit or trump?**  
  You may play any card.

- **Can I pass a 1-value card during “Pass left”?**  
  Yes, unless “Except 1” is the rule (but that applies only to discards).

- **Do discarded cards count as loot?**  
  No. Only 1-value cards captured in tricks count as loot.

- **Are the set-aside cards in 2-player game used later?**  
  Yes. They are shuffled back into the deck for subsequent rounds.
