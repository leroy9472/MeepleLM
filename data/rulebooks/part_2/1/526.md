# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Abalone is an abstract strategy game centered around pushing opponents' marbles off a hexagonal board. The core objective in the standard two-player game is to eject six of the opponent's marbles. The game emphasizes tactics such as controlling the center, maintaining cohesive groups, and dividing the opponent's forces. The provided materials focus on a wide array of rule variations and starting positions, adapting the core mechanics for 2 to 6 players, often with altered win conditions, such as capturing a central "princess" marble or ejecting a "ball" in a soccer variant.

## 2. Components
*   A hexagonal board with 61 spaces (HexHex-5).
*   14 black marbles and 14 white marbles for the standard two-player game.
*   Additional marbles in various colors (e.g., red, yellow, blue, green) are required for many of the variants, especially those with more than two players or special pieces.
*   The game may also use marbles of a different color to represent special pieces like a "Pillar," "Princess," "Prince," "treasure," or a "ball."

## 3. Setup
The setup varies drastically depending on the chosen variant. The source materials list over 20 different starting positions.

*   **Standard Two-Player:** Each player places 14 marbles in a triangle formation on opposite sides of the board (5-4-3-2 rows).
*   **Belgian Daisy:** An alternate two-player setup where each player's marbles are arranged in a daisy-like pattern, split into two groups.
*   **Three Players:** Each player has 11 marbles arranged in a triangle. Players take turns clockwise.
*   **Four Players:** Each player has 9 marbles arranged in a rhombus (4-3-2). Players opposite each other are teammates.
*   **Five Players:** Four players have 8 marbles each, and the central player has 7 marbles.
*   **Six Players:** Six players, typically organized into three teams of two, with members facing each other.
*   **Special Setups:** Variants like "The Pillar," "Abalone Soccer," and "Bagdad Thief" include a neutral or special-colored marble placed at the center or a specific location on the board.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
1.  **Starting Player:** In the standard game, Black moves first. For variants, the starting player is often determined by the rules of that specific variant.
2.  **Player Turn:** On a player's turn, they perform one move.
3.  **Move Execution:** A player can move 1, 2, or 3 of their own marbles that are in a straight, connected line (a "column").
4.  **Move Type:**
    *   **Lateral Move:** The column moves sideways to an adjacent empty space.
    *   **In-line Move (Sumito):** The column moves forward in the direction it is pointing. If it pushes against an opposing marble or column, a Sumito occurs.
5.  **Sumito (Pushing):** A player can push opposing marbles only with an in-line move. The push is successful if the moving player has more marbles in the column than the opponent has in the line being pushed (e.g., 2 vs. 1, 3 vs. 1, 3 vs. 2).
6.  **Ejecting Marbles:** If a Sumito push forces an opposing marble off the edge of the board, that marble is ejected and removed from the game.
7.  **End of Turn:** The turn passes to the next player.

## 5. Core Mechanics
*   **Columns:** A group of 1, 2, or 3 marbles in a straight, connected line that can be moved as a unit.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Moving a column sideways. This cannot be used to push opposing marbles.
*   **In-line Movement (Sumito):** Moving a column forward. This is the only way to push.
*   **Pushing (Sumito):** The core combat mechanic. A player can push a smaller opposing line (1 or 2 marbles) with a larger one (2 or 3 marbles). The push requires an empty space behind the opposing line or for the opposing line to be against the board's edge.
*   **Ejecting:** A marble is ejected when a Sumito push forces it off the board. It is removed and does not return.
*   **Ko-Rule:** A player may not recreate a board position that resulted from one of their own previous moves, preventing infinite loops.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
The end-game condition is highly variant-dependent.

*   **Standard Two-Player:** The first player to eject 6 of their opponent's marbles wins.
*   **Three-Player:** The first player to eject 6 opposing marbles (from any combination of opponents) wins.
*   **Four-Player (Team):** The first team to eject 6 marbles of the opposing team wins.
*   **"The Pillar" / "Save the Princess":** The first player to eject the special central marble wins.
*   **"Abalone Soccer":** The first player to eject the neutral "ball" marble across one of the three edges of the opponent's half of the board wins.
*   **"The Berlin Thief":** The first player to eject their opponent's special "treasure" marble wins.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
*   **Can I move more than 3 marbles at once?** No. A player can only move 1, 2, or 3 marbles in a single turn, provided they are connected in a straight line.
*   **Can I push with a lateral move?** No. Pushing (Sumito) can only occur with an in-line move.
*   **Can I push an equal number of marbles?** No. A player can only push if their column is larger than the opposing column (e.g., 2 vs. 1, 3 vs. 1, 3 vs. 2). A 2 vs. 2 or 3 vs. 3 push is blocked.
*   **What happens if I can't move?** The rules do not explicitly define a "pass" for the standard game, implying that a player must always be able to make a legal move. In variants, a player may be eliminated if they cannot move.
*   **Can a special marble (like the Pillar) be pushed?** No. In the "Pillar" variant, the central marble is immovable and cannot be pushed by any player.
