## Reykholt – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In Reykholt, players are vegetable farmers in Iceland, harnessing geothermal energy to grow crops and supply tourists. The goal is to advance your manager the furthest along the Tourism Track by strategically managing workers, greenhouses, and goods. The player whose manager is farthest along the Tourism Track at the end of the game wins. In case of a tie, the player whose manager is in front on the tied table (i.e., arrived last) wins.

The game lasts 7 rounds in standard mode, or 8 rounds in Story Mode. Story Mode introduces scenario-specific rules and victory conditions.

### 3. Setup  

#### 3.1 Board & Covering Tile  
- Place the Game Board with the side matching player count:  
  - 1–2 players: use 1/2P side  
  - 3–4 players: use 3/4P side  
- Covering Tile placement:

  - 3P: place face up over the top row of the board

#### 3.2 Greenhouse Cards  
- Remove greenhouse cards exceeding player count (based on scarecrow symbols on back).  
- Sort remaining greenhouses into face-up piles by parcel count (3, 4, 5, 6 parcels).  
- Random Greenhouse pile (cards with “?” on back):  
  - Set aside the card with [flip] symbol  
  - Shuffle the rest face down  
  - Place the [flip] card on top, face down

- Place stack on marked space (storybook icon), on top of covering tile if present  

#### 3.5 Goods & Stacks  
- Place wooden goods in Goods Boxes = **Supply**  
- Stack 1 mushroom, 1 lettuce, 1 tomato (bottom to top) next to Service Card display  

#### 3.6 Player Setup

  - 3 Workers (discs)  
  - 1 Manager (bottle)  
  - 1 Summary Card

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has 4 phases:

1. **Work Time** – Workers perform actions  
2. **Harvest Time** – Harvest from greenhouses  
3. **Tourism Time** – Advance manager on Tourism Track  
4. **Homecoming Time** – Retrieve workers, flip round tile, pass Start Player  

Repeat for 7 (or 8) rounds.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### 5.1 Work Time  
- Starting with Start Player, players take turns placing one worker on a free action space.  
- Continue until all players have placed all 3 workers.  
- When placing a worker, immediately perform **all actions** of that space (if possible).  

**Placement Rules:**  
- Only place on free action spaces (no workers present)  
- Must be able to perform **at least one** action on the space  
- If able to perform an action, **must do it** (cannot skip)  
- Actions may be performed in any order unless specified  
- “OR” means exclusive choice (A or B, not both)  
- Arrow (→) means discard left to gain right  

**Action Columns:**  
- Property | Field | Market | Town Hall  
- Some spaces have **flags**  
  - Each player may use **only one flagged space per column per round**  

**Key Action Types:**  
- **Seed**:  
  - Take 1 good from **stock**, place in a parcel of an **empty greenhouse** you own  
  - Entire greenhouse must be empty  
  - Greenhouse shows allowed vegetable types  
  - After seeding, fill all remaining empty parcels with same type from **supply**  
  - “Seed at least X times”: must seed minimum X times; no upper limit if resources allow  
- **Harvest**:  
  - Take 1 good from 1 of your greenhouses to your **stock**  
  - If action says “harvest X times”, must use **different greenhouses** each time (unless stated otherwise)  
  - You may harvest fewer times than allowed  
- **Take a Service Card**:  
  - Choose 1 card from the display and place in front of you  
  - If taking one of the **last 3 cards**, take the top good from the nearby stack:  
    - Last 3: take tomato  
    - Last 2: take lettuce  
    - Last 1: take mushroom  
- **Immediately Advance**:  
  - Move your manager **1 table forward** on Tourism Track **without paying**  

**Service Card Clarifications:**  
- Effects are active immediately upon taking the card  
- **Red text** = “immediately and once only” – must be able to use effect when taken  
- In 3–4P games, cards can be **shared** with adjacent players:  
  - Slide card between two players  
  - Only those two may use it  
  - If used for a one-time effect, it is consumed  
- “At any time” cards can be used even out of turn  
- Triggered effects (e.g., “when you harvest”) only activate via **worker-placed actions**, not passive effects  
- Resolve simultaneous triggers in turn order  
- “Rarest type” = vegetable shown in **golden box** on greenhouse (not personal scarcity)  
  - Rarity order: Tomato > Lettuce > Mushroom > Cauliflower > Carrot (Carrot is rarest)  

#### 5.2 Harvest Time  
- Each player harvests **once per filled greenhouse**  
- If a greenhouse has mixed goods (via card effects), player chooses which good to harvest  

#### 5.3 Tourism Time  
- Players act in **Tourism Track order**: furthest ahead goes first, then next, etc.  
- On your turn:  
  - Advance your manager **as many tables as you can afford**  
  - To advance, discard goods from **stock** equal to those shown on the **signpost** of the next table  
- **If you land on a table with other managers**, place your manager **in front** of them  
- **If you complete the full track**, return to start and continue; treat each table as requiring **+6** of the shown good type  

**Using “The Bonus”**  
- **Once per round**, during your Tourism Time turn, you **must** use the Bonus  
- Instead of discarding goods to advance, **take those goods from supply** and advance  
- Can be used **before, after, or between** normal advances  
- Goods gained via Bonus **can be used to pay** for further advances in the same turn  
- You **must use the Bonus** — you cannot skip it  

#### 5.4 Homecoming Time  
- All players retrieve their workers  
- Flip and discard the top Game Round Tile  
- Start Player passes the Start Player Card to the left  
- Next round begins

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after the **final Game Round Tile** is discarded during Homecoming Time  
- **Winner**: Player whose manager is **farthest** along the Tourism Track  
- **Tiebreaker**: Among tied players, the one **in front on the table** (arrived last) wins  

**Story Mode Variations:**  
- Number of rounds and victory conditions are defined by the **Scenario Card**  
- At start of Work Time each round, **reveal top Event Card** and apply effect (then discard)  
- Players must meet **all victory conditions** on the Scenario Card to win  
  - If no player meets conditions, **no one wins**  
- Story Mode Service Cards can be used in standard game

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Random Greenhouses pile empty?**  
  If an action requires drawing a random greenhouse and none remain, gain **1 tomato** instead.  
- **Empty Greenhouses?**  
  Players **keep** empty greenhouses; they are not returned.  
- **Harvesting multiple times?**  
  - “Harvest 2 times” = must harvest exactly 2 times from different greenhouses  
  - “Harvest up to 2 times” = may harvest 1 or 2 times  
  - “Harvest twice from same greenhouse” = both from one greenhouse  
- **Service Card Limits?**  
  No limit on number of cards or shared cards. Cards are **never discarded**.  
- **Rarest Good?**  
  Always refers to the **golden box** on the greenhouse, **not** personal stock scarcity.  
- **Flagged Spaces?**  
  Max **1 flagged space per column per round**. You may use multiple spaces in a column if only one is flagged.  
- **Town Hall Action: “Discard 2 greenhouses and 2 identical goods”**  
  Goods must come from **personal stock**, not unharvested greenhouse goods.  
- **Farm Girl Service Card**:  
  At start of Homecoming Time, may seed at least 1 time, treating each greenhouse as having **3 parcels** (can plant in any empty greenhouse, fill up to 3 parcels).  
- **Geothermal Heat Pump**:  
  “Whenever you seed at least 1 time, you may harvest 1 time.”  
  - Must complete **all seeding** before harvesting  
  - Cannot seed → harvest → seed again in same action  
- **Carrot Seed Card**:  
  Fill 1 empty parcel in **each** of your greenhouses with 1 carrot from supply  
  - Can plant in greenhouses that don’t normally allow carrots  
  - Full greenhouses are skipped

  Fill a **5-parcel greenhouse** with 1 of each vegetable (tomato, lettuce, mushroom, cauliflower, carrot)  
  - Must have **exactly** a 5-parcel greenhouse  
- **Village Elder Card (shared)**:  
  If two players share and both are alone at a table, both may advance — **leader moves first**, then second player moves in front.  
- **Service Card giving mushrooms when discarding greenhouses**:  
  Gain **1 mushroom per greenhouse discarded** (e.g., discard 2 → gain 2 mushrooms)  
- **Small Mushroom Rearing**:  
  When harvesting during Work Time, gain **1 mushroom** — only once per action, even if harvesting multiple times  
- **Secret Hoard**:  
  After completing a “seed at least 1 time” action, may take the **top good** from this card into stock  
  - Cannot use that good **in the same seeding action**
