# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of two phases:
1. **Movement**: 
   - Outer/Middle Regions: Roll one die and move that many spaces clockwise or counterclockwise.
   - Inner Region: Move exactly one space per turn.
2. **Encounters**:
   - Choose to encounter either the space landed on or another character in that space.
   - Resolve encounters in order: Events and Enemies first (by encounter number, then draw order), followed by Strangers, Places, and finally Objects/Followers.
   - Complete all space instructions before moving on (in Inner Region).
   - Turn ends after encounters are resolved.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Combat
**Battles** occur against Enemies with Strength or when attacking another character:
1. Evade (optional, before dice roll).
2. Cast Spells (before attack rolls).
3. Both sides roll one die for attack roll.
4. Add Strength to attack roll for attack score.
5. Compare scores: higher wins, equal is stand-off.
6. Winner may take Life, Object, or Gold from loser.

**Psychic Combat** occurs against Spirits or when special ability allows:
- Same as Battles, but uses Craft instead of Strength.
- No Object can prevent loss of life.

### Spells
- Castable if Craft ≥ Spell requirement.
- Maximum Spells held = Craft value (modified by Magic Objects).
- Maximum Spells cast per turn = number of Spells at turn start.
- One Spell may be cast during another player's turn (except Command Spell).
- Spells affecting characters work anywhere; those affecting creatures don't work in Inner Region.

### Movement Between Regions
**Outer ↔ Middle**: Cross at Sentinel space (fight Sentinel when entering Middle) or use Raft.
- Raft: Build in Woods/Forest with Axe; use next turn to cross directly opposite.
- Sentinel: Must defeat or evade to enter Middle Region.

**Middle → Inner**: Use Portal of Power.
- Must attempt to open each time.
- Roll 1 die: 4, 5, or 6 succeeds.
- Success: Turn ends on Plain of Peril.
- Failure: Turn ends on Portal of Power.

**Inner Region Movement**: One space per turn; complete space instructions before moving on.

### Special Rules
**Toads**: When transformed:
- Strength 1, Craft 1, moves 1 space/turn without rolling.
- Cannot gain/cast Spells.
- Retains trophies, lives, fate.
- Special abilities disabled.
- Transformation lasts 3 turns; extended by 3 if affected again.

**Trophies**: Killed Enemies (non-Spirit) become Strength trophies; Spirits become Craft trophies.
- Exchange at end of turn: 7 Strength points = 1 Strength counter; 7 Craft points = 1 Craft counter.

**Object Limits**: Maximum 4 Objects unless Mule is owned.
- Excess Objects must be discarded to space.
- Only one Weapon and one Armour may be used in combat.

**Alignment**: Characters may change alignment (once per turn).
- Must discard cards not permitted by new alignment.
- Druid may change at will.

**Evading**: Characters may evade:
- Any attacking creature or character.
- Unfriendly individuals (Black Knight, Hag, etc.) via special rule.
- Cannot evade Inner Region creatures.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends when only one character remains. The winner is determined by eliminating all other characters via:
- Combat or Psychic Combat.
- Command Spell from Crown of Command (requires 4, 5, or 6 on die roll to make others lose Life).
- Losing all Lives (character is removed from game permanently once someone reaches Crown of Command).

Reaching the Crown of Command requires:
- A Talisman (acquired by drawing from Adventure deck or completing Warlock's Quest).
- Entry through Valley of Fire (only accessible with Talisman).

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Multiple Enemies**: Same encounter number fight as one with combined Strength/Craft.
- **Fate**: May reroll one die per roll (movement, attack, or card instruction); cannot reroll creature's die.
- **Cursed Glade/Desert**: Effects only apply when encountering the space, not when encountering another character there.
- **Raft**: Cannot be saved; must be discarded after use or decision not to use.
- **Warlock's Quest**: Must complete immediately when possible; prevents Portal of Power attempts until completed.
- **Character Death**: If no one has reached Crown of Command, player may draw new character next turn. Otherwise, player is eliminated.
- **Talisman Requirement**: Required to enter Valley of Fire and reach Crown of Command.
- **Command Spell**: Can be cast once per turn by character alone on Crown of Command.
