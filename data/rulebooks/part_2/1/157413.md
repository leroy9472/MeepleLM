## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
New Bedford is a strategy board game set in the 19th-century whaling port of New Bedford, Massachusetts. Players take on the roles of industrialists and shipowners, developing buildings, managing resources, and sending ships on whaling voyages to earn Victory Points (VPs). The goal is to amass the most VPs by the end of the game through building construction, whaling success, and special abilities.

2. Components  
- Town Board (with building spaces, captain rondels, and whaling track)  
- Building Tiles (Base Game, Expansion, Victory Buildings, 5th Player Expansion, Ship’s Log variant)  
- Resource Tokens: Wood, Brick, Food, Goods, Money ($)  
- Ship Markers  
- Whale Tokens (Right, Sperm, Humpback)  
- Round Marker  
- Captain Tokens (4 small ship's wheels)  
- Dice (2)  
- Ship’s Log Cards (event cards)  
- Victory Point (VP) Track  
- Optional: Turner’s Mill tile (for Lonely Ocean solo variant)

3. Setup  
- Choose number of players (2–5). Select appropriate building sets:
  - 2-player: Use suggested 2-player expansion buildings (e.g., Captain's H, Coffeehouse, Customhouse, etc.)
  - 3–4 players: Add Post Office, Inn, etc.
  - 5-player: Include Almshouse, College, Empty Lot, Fire House, and 5th Player Victory Buildings (Rectory)
  - Ship’s Log variant: Include Library, Insurance Co., Newspaper
  - Solo (Lonely Ocean): Add Turner’s Mill
- Place building tiles face-up in designated columns on the town board.
- Each player receives:
  - Starting resources: Any combination totaling $5 in goods or money (e.g., 3 wood + $2, 2 brick + 1 wood, etc.)
  - 1 ship marker
  - Place round marker on first space of round track.
- Position captain tokens on the captain rondels according to starting positions (per rulebook).
- Shuffle Ship’s Log cards if using that variant.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds over a series of rounds until the end condition is triggered. Each round has the following phases:

1. **Captain Phase**: Activate captains clockwise. Each captain performs the action shown on their current space (e.g., gain resources, build, sell goods, whaling actions).
   - Split spaces on captain rondels indicate which rounds the action is active.
2. **Player Action Phase**: Players take turns performing one action each until all pass.
   - Actions include: Build, Whaling, Sell Goods, Use Building Ability, Captain's Orders (default action)
3. **Round End Phase**:
   - Advance round marker.
   - Resolve any end-of-round effects (e.g., from Ship’s Log cards).
   - If round marker reaches final space, proceed to scoring.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Building Construction**: Pay resource cost to place a building tile. Each building grants a unique ability.
- **Whaling Track**:
  - Players send ships on whaling voyages.
  - Movement costs food; spaces offer rewards (e.g., whale tokens).
  - The topmost space is the "Return" space (no food cost; allows return without catching).
  - 7 other spaces with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd positions for rewards.
- **Selling Whales**:
  - "Cost" to sell whales = "Lay" value (per whale type).
  - Sold whales go to bank (or to captains in solo game).
- **Tryworks Building**:
  - Immediate action: Convert 3 Right Whales on a ship into 1 returned whale (regardless of ship’s location or return status).
- **Resource Management**:
  - Resources: Wood, Brick, Food, Goods, Money.
  - Used for building, whaling, and resolving events.
- **Captain Tokens**: Represent AI-controlled agents; use ship's wheels from punchboard.
- **Victory Buildings**:
  - Choose 4 per game.
  - Score VP at end based on specific conditions (see individual tiles).
  - Examples:
    - **Municipal Office**: 4 wood + 4 brick to build (not 4 food + 4 brick).
    - **Newspaper**: 1 VP per 2 Ship’s Log cards held.
    - **Salvage Yard**: 1 VP per 4 goods.
    - **Candleworks**: 3 food + 3 brick to build.
- **Barrel Symbol**: On victory buildings, indicates bonus VP at game end.
- **Ship’s Log Variant**:
  - Add Library, Insurance Co., Newspaper.
  - Draw and resolve Ship’s Log cards each round.
  - Errata:
    - *Uncharted Desert Isle*: “shore of this”, not “short of this”
    - *Broken Mast*: Repair cost = 3 wood (not 5)
    - *Ice Sheet*: Cancel movement; return ships to original positions

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends when round marker reaches final space.
- Final scoring:
  - Points from built Victory Buildings (based on tile conditions).
  - Points from building abilities with end-game scoring (e.g., Newspaper, Salvage Yard).
  - Points from barrel symbols on Victory Buildings.
  - Any other VP from abilities or cards.
- Player with highest total VP wins.
- Tie: Fewer buildings wins. If still tied, tied players share victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Captain Tokens**: Use small ship's wheels from punchboard, not as shown in rulebook.
- **Return Space**: Only topmost space on whaling track; no food cost; players still participate in whaling.
- **Tryworks Timing**: Action is immediate; does not require ship to return.
- **Solo Game (Stubb)**:
  - When Stubb builds, roll die to choose column.
  - If all buildings in column are built, Stubb does not build and takes Captain’s Orders.
  - Captains buy sold whales; distribute evenly if multiple captains.
- **“Church”**: Refers to Seamen’s Bethel.
- **Fire House**: “from” means effect applies to your own holdings, not taking from others.
- **Perfumery**: Unbuilt side says “2 more” → should be “2 or more”.
- **Almshouse**: Front should read “≥ 4” to match back.
- **Rising Tide Variant**: Use Harbor Office as Sundial Building.
- **Loading Dock**: Use action on unbuilt side (front iconography incorrect).
- **Brewery**: Back should have DHMG symbol (2 dice).
- **College**: Build cost = 2 food + 1 brick.
- **Rectory**: Spelling error on Seamen’s Bethel; correct interpretation applies.
- **Refinery**: “new” → should be “now”.
- **Mayor’s House**: “it’s” → should be “its”.
