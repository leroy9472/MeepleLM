## TRAILBLAZERS — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Trailblazers are adventurers who forge paths through the wilderness via hiking, biking, and kayaking. The goal of the game is to score the most points by constructing completed loops of trail—contiguous paths of a single type (hiking, biking, or kayaking) that start and end at a matching camp card.

Points are earned from:
- Loop length (1 point per trail marker)
- In-Game and End-Game Goal Cards
- Optional expansions: Animals, Adventurers, or Solo Modes

Victory is determined by highest total score. In case of a tie, the player who completed the most goals wins; if still tied, the victory is shared.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game is played over **4 rounds**. Each round consists of:
1. Deal 8 Trail Cards to each player (or draw 8 in solo).
2. Simultaneously select and place one Camp Card (except in Round 4).
3. Three turns:
   - Select and place 2 Trail Cards
   - Pass remaining hand:
     - Rounds 1 & 3 → pass left
     - Rounds 2 & 4 → pass right
4. After 3 turns, discard remaining 2 cards.

In **solo modes**, instead of passing:
- Discard remaining cards to a discard pile
- Draw back up to 8 cards

**Card Placement Rules:**
- Must be orthogonally adjacent to or overlapping an existing card
- First camp starts player area (no adjacency required)
- **No card may overlap a camp**
- Trail cards may overlap other trail cards

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Loop Construction
- A **loop** is a continuous trail of one type (hiking/biking/kayaking) that starts at a matching camp and returns to it.
- Trail markers (bridges, berms, rapids, mud, rocks, tunnels) are counted once per pass.
- If a loop crosses itself, the marker at intersection is counted **twice**.

#### Animal Expansion Rules
- Some Trail Cards show an animal icon on the long trail.
- When placing such a card, player may place a **matching animal token** on its center.
- Once placed:
  - The card **cannot be overlapped**
  - Only the **long trail** is linked to the animal
- Scoring:
  - For each completed loop: bonus points based on **number of unique animal types** on that loop:
    - 1: 1 pt, 2: 3 pts, 3: 6 pts, 4: 10 pts, 5: 15 pts, 6: 21 pts
  - Duplicate animals of same type do not increase score.

#### Adventurer Expansion Rules
- No Goal Cards used.
- Start of Round 2: place one traveler (hiker/biker/kayaker) on each of your two placed camps. Discard third camp and figure.
- After placing cards each turn:
  - Move each traveler **3 trail markers** along their path
  - First move: choose direction from camp; continue same path/direction thereafter
- Movement modifiers:
  - Passing a **new animal type**: slows traveler; counts as **2 moves**, stops at or passes animal on third
  - Reaching dead end: stop early, lay campfire token **flat** → no further movement this round
  - Reaching camp (loop completed): traveler stops permanently
- Cannot place cards under travelers or campfires; cannot add animals to traveled segments
- End of Rounds 2–4: may place a **standing** campfire token next to traveler unless:
  - It camped early (flat token)
  - It reached camp (loop closed)

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Standard Game Scoring:
- **Loops:** 1 point per trail marker
- **In-Game Goal Cards:**
  - First to achieve: place Player Card in 1st slot (6 pts)
  - Second: 2nd slot (3 pts)
  - Third: 3rd slot (1 pt)
  - Multiple players on same turn → all get top unclaimed rank
  - Once slots filled, no more scoring
- **End-Game Goal Cards:**
  - Score based on final standing (1st: 6 pts, 2nd: 3 pts, 3rd: 1 pt)
  - Ties: all tied players receive same rank; next rank skips accordingly

**Final Scoring:**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I overlap a trail card that has an animal token?**  
A: No. Once an animal token is placed, the card cannot be overlapped.

**Q: Can I break a loop that previously fulfilled an In-Game Goal?**  
A: Yes. Once a goal is claimed, it remains scored even if the loop is later disrupted.

**Q: What happens if multiple players qualify for an In-Game Goal on the same turn?**  
A: All qualifying players take the **highest unclaimed rank** and score accordingly.

**Q: Can I place a camp on top of a trail?**  
A: No. Camps cannot be overlapped by any card.

**Q: Do trail markers count twice if a loop crosses itself?**  
A: Yes. Each time the traveler passes a marker, it counts — including twice at self-intersections.

**Q: Can I change direction of a traveler in Adventurer mode?**  
A: No. Once direction is chosen from camp, it must continue unless blocked.

**Q: Can I place a card under a campfire or traveler?**  
A: No. Cards cannot be placed under figures or campfires.

**Q: Can I add an animal token after the turn I placed the card?**  
A: No. Decision must be made **during the turn** the card is placed.

**Q: What happens when the draw pile runs out in bonus stages?**  
A: Gather all discard piles (including prior game discards), shuffle, and form new draw pile.
