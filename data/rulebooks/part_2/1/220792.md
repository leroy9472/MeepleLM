# The Expanse: Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In *The Expanse*, players represent one of four factions—United Nations (UN), Martian Congressional Republic (MCR), Outer Planets Alliance (OPA), or Protogen—competing for control of the solar system. The objective is to score the most Control Points (CP) by the end of the game through influence on Bases, orbital dominance, and control of critical resources.

The game ends when the sixth Scoring card is drawn, triggering Final Scoring. Victory is determined by total CP, with ties broken by Initiative Track position (or Rocinante ownership in 2-player games).

## 2. Components
- 1 Game Board (solar system map)
- 52 Action Cards (including 6 Score Cards)
- 4 Faction Mats (UN, MCR, OPA, Protogen)
- 1 Rocinante Mat
- 18 Influence Cubes per faction (UN: 15 regular + 3 Diplomat)
- 18 Fleet Tokens (5 per faction; MCR has 2 Battleships; OPA has 2 Scrap Ships)
- 12 Faction Tech Cards (3 per faction)
- 1 Rocinante Token
- 2 Battleship Tokens (MCR)
- 2 Scrap Ship Tokens (OPA)
- 2 Protomolecule Tokens
- 3 Diplomat Cubes (UN)
- 1 Initiative Track
- CP Track
- 6 Bonus Sector Tokens

## 3. Setup
1. Each player chooses a faction and takes:
   - Faction mat
   - 18 influence cubes
   - 5 fleets (MCR: 3 normal, 2 Battleships; OPA: 5 normal + 2 Scrap Ships)
2. Set up forces per the back of each faction mat.
3. For player count:
   - 2 players: UN & MCR only; place Initiative tokens face-down on Luna, Vesta, Io, The Rings (out of play)
   - 3 players: UN, MCR, OPA
   - 4 players: all factions
4. Randomly select first player; play proceeds clockwise.
5. Place Initiative tokens on the Initiative Track in reverse player order (last player on top).
6. Last player receives the Rocinante mat and places the Rocinante token in their Home Orbital.
7. Each player places one influence cube on the "10" space of the CP Track.
8. Prepare the Action Deck:
   - Remove 6 Score Cards.
   - Shuffle remaining cards and create stacks:
     - 4 players: 3 stacks of 13 cards + 2 Score Cards each; place 5-card pile on top
     - 3 players: same, with 10-card stacks
     - 2 players: 3 stacks of 10 cards + 2 Score Cards each
9. Deal 5 cards face-up to the Action Track (slots 0–2).
10. Place 6 Bonus Sector Tokens face-down near the Bonus Track.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
On a player’s turn, choose one of two options:
1. **Take a Card from the Action Track**:
   - Pay CP equal to the slot cost (0, 1, or 2).
   - If a Score Card is taken, proceed immediately to Scoring.
   - Otherwise, choose:
     - **Use the Event**: If your faction icon is on the card, perform the event immediately or pay 1 CP to keep it for later.
     - **Use Action Points (AP)**: Spend AP on Move, Influence, or Build actions. Then, the highest eligible faction on the Initiative Track may use the event (moving their token to the bottom if they do).
2. **Play a Kept Event**: Use a saved event card (no CP cost). Discard after use.

After turn:
- Slide cards toward the 0-cost slot.
- Refill the Action Track to 5 cards.

## 5. Core Mechanics

## 6. Scoring & End Game

### Scoring Rounds (when a Score Card is taken)
1. **Select Bonus Sector**: Active player secretly chooses one of three Sectors (Inner Planets, Belt, Outer Planets).
2. **Play Kept/Rocinante Events**: Starting left of active player, each may play one kept event or Rocinante ability.
3. **Score Bases**:
   - **Bonus Sector**: 1st/2nd/3rd place earns CP based on round:
     - 1st Scoring: 2/1/0
     - 2nd & 3rd: 3/1/0
     - 4th & 5th: 4/2/1
   - **Non-Bonus Bases**: 1/0/0 (only sole 1st place scores).
   - **Orbital Control**: +1 influence if you have most fleet strength in the Orbital (MCR Battleship = 2, OPA Scrap Ship = 0.5).
   - **Critical Resource Bonus**: +1 CP per Base with your faction’s critical resource (if you have sole 1st place). Not awarded in 2-player games.
4. **Gain New Techs**: After 1st, 2nd, and 3rd scoring, factions gain Tech I, II, III respectively.
5. **Build Fleets**: Each player may build 1 fleet on Home Orbital.
6. **Pass Rocinante**: Give to player with fewest CP. Tie: lowest on Initiative Track.

### Final Scoring (6th Score Card drawn)
- No Bonus Sector selected.
- Events played starting left of Rocinante holder.
- All Bases score 5/3/1 for 1st/2nd/3rd.
- Critical Resource bonus applies.
- Highest CP wins. Tie: highest on Initiative Track (2-player: Rocinante holder wins).

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Influence Limits**: If out of cubes, move existing influence instead of placing.
- **Fleet Limits**: Cannot build if no fleets in reserve.
- **Event Clarifications**:
  - "Move" and "Place" refer to own units unless stated.
  - UN chooses which influence (Diplomat or regular) is affected when removed.
  - Battleship removal: flip to 1-pt first; cannot be repaired same turn.
  - Scrap Ships: count as 0.5 for orbital control.
- **Scoring Ties**:
  - 1st place tie: all get 2nd place points.
  - 2nd place tie: all get 3rd place points.
  - 3rd place tie: no points.
- **Rocinante**:
  - Counts as a fleet but cannot be removed.
  - May use crew ability during scoring instead of kept event.
- **Tech Interactions**:
  - UN cannot have both Diplomats and Embassies.
  - OPA may stack Scrap Ship techs.
