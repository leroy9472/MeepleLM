## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Leonardo Da Vinci is a worker placement and engine-building game where players take on the roles of Renaissance inventors competing to complete the most prestigious inventions. The objective is to earn the most victory points by successfully completing inventions, diversifying invention types, and managing resources and workers efficiently.

This rule variant, designed by Eric Pietrocupo, modifies several core mechanics to enhance balance, strategy, and pacing. It introduces revised starting conditions, updated scoring, streamlined worker placement, and enhanced council actions. The game remains modular—players may adopt individual changes as desired.

### 3. Setup  

#### Starting Resources (Expert Setup Modified)  
- All players use the expert setup.  
- After receiving starting pieces, collect 1 ingredient card of each type, shuffle them, and deal 1 randomly to each player. Return remaining cards to their respective decks.  
- **5-player game only**: Each player receives a half-favor choice:  
  - A) 1 ingredient card  
  - B) 2 Florins  

#### New Favors (Available During Game)  
Players may take one of the following favors instead of a standard action:  
- A) Gain 1 new worker  
- B) Gain 2 ingredient cards  
- C) Gain 5 Florins  
- D) Laboratory upgrade  

#### Invention Deck Setup  
- Separate invention cards into 5 piles by rank:  
  - A) Gold 21–25  
  - B) Gold 16–20  
  - C) Silver 11–15  
  - D) Copper 6–10  
  - E) Bronze 1–5  
- Shuffle each pile.  
- Take 2 cards from pile B, add to pile A, then shuffle pile A. Place this stack on the main deck.  
- Take 2 cards from pile C → add to pile B → shuffle → place on deck.  
- Repeat: 2 from D → C; 2 from E → D.  
- Place final 3 cards from E on top of the deck.  
- Reveal 5 invention cards face-up (regardless of player count).  

#### First Player  
- The first player marker rotates clockwise at the end of each turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

1. **Worker Placement Phase**  
   - Players take turns placing **one worker at a time**.  
   - Resolution order follows placement: first-placed worker resolves first.  
   - **Masters**: When placed in a line, a master goes to the front of the line **but behind any masters already present**.  
   - **Multiple Workers Allowed**: A player may place more than one worker in the same action line. This allows multiple uses of that action when resolved (if space allows).  
   - **Laboratory Placement**: Workers do **not** need to be placed on laboratories during this phase. At the beginning of the turn, players may assign workers to their labs for research or bidding. Unused lab workers contribute to research.  

2. **Resolution Phase**  
   - Resolve city areas A through H in order, using the Lord of the City marker.  
   - **Council Actions (Enhanced)**:  
     - **Move Worker**: Move any **non-master** worker from one line to the **end** of any line. Cannot move masters. Cannot move workers to the Council if using this variant.  
     - **Florins**: Gain 2 Florins (does not stack if not taken).  
     - **Resource**: Gain 1 ingredient of any type.  
     - **Inventions**: Look at the top 4 invention cards, reorder them, and place the top card face-up. This invention becomes available this turn.  
   - After resolving all city areas, conduct **laboratory research** simultaneously.  

3. **Invention Completion & Revelation**  
   - After research, players may complete inventions if requirements are met.  
   - **Revelation Order**: Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player reveals **one** completed invention.  
     - Only the **first player** to reveal a specific invention receives the **invention card** and full **bonus Florins**.  
     - Subsequent players who completed the same invention receive **no card** and **reduced Florins** (amount not specified; assumed per base game).  
   - After all players reveal their **first** invention:  
     - Replace all revealed/incomplete inventions with new ones from the deck.  
     - Players then reveal **second** completed inventions (if any), repeating the process.  

4. **Turn End**  
   - Rotate first player marker clockwise.  
   - Proceed to next turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Worker Placement Rules  
- **No Overbidding**: Players place one worker at a time; resolution is sequential.  
- **Master Priority**: Masters always go to the front of a line but **not ahead of previously placed masters**.  
- **Multiple Workers**: Allowed in same line; enables multiple actions if space and rewards permit.  
- **Laboratory Assignment**: Workers are assigned to labs **at the start of the turn**, not via placement. Unused lab workers count toward research.  

#### Invention Rules  
- **Exact Components Required**: To complete an invention, a lab must have **exactly** the required components—no extras, no substitutes.  
- **No Reuse**: Cannot work on an invention already completed by another player.  
- **No Mid-Process Switching**: Cannot switch to a different invention unless components match exactly.  

#### Laboratory Rules  
- Cannot add components under a lab currently working on an invention.  
- Cannot upgrade a lab or install a mechanical man if the work counter is at zero and no workers are assigned.  
- Mechanical men cannot be moved or delayed in installation.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Basic Scoring  
- For each completed invention, score **1 VP per required ingredient** (1–4 VPs per invention).  

#### Bonus Points (Diversity Bonus)  
- Based on number of **different invention types** completed:  
  - 2 types = +1 VP  
  - 3 types = +4 VP  
  - 4 types = +9 VP  
  - 5 types = +16 VP  

#### Tiebreaker  
- If total VPs are tied, the player with **more Florins** wins.  

#### Optional Rule: Florins to Points  
- Each **10 Florins = 1 VP** (optional; may favor gold-invention specialists).  

#### Tracking Victory Points  
- **Recommended**: Use external tokens/chips.  
- **Alternative**: Only the player who **owns** the invention card scores points. If a player completes another’s invention, they do **not** score for it.  

#### End of Game  
- Game ends after the **ninth turn**.  
- No new inventions are revealed after the **eighth turn**.  
- Players may **start new inventions** on turns 8 and 9.
