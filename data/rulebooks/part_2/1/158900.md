## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are samurai defending a village from waves of raiders across three increasingly dangerous rounds. The goal is to survive all three rounds by protecting at least one family and one farmstead. If any samurai dies (suffers a fourth wound), the game is lost.

### 2. Components  
- Village board with spaces for barricades, farms, and families  
- Samurai boards (one per player) with battle tracks, talents, and Kiai powers  
- Raider cards: Plunderers (1–4), Lieutenants (5), Bosses (6)  
- Intruder stack and discard pile areas  
- Barricade tokens, farmstead tokens (6), family tokens (3)  
- Samurai meeples and support tokens  
- Wound markers  
- Active player marker  

### 3. Setup  
- **Difficulty Level**: Choose Easy, Normal, Hard, or Heroic.  
  - *Barricades*:  
    - Easy: #players + 3  
    - Normal: #players + 2  
    - Hard: #players + 1  
    - Heroic: #players  
  - *Raider Stack*:  
    - Plunderers: #players × 7 (×6 in Easy)  
    - Lieutenants & Bosses: #players each (–1 in Easy)  
- Place 6 farmsteads and 3 family tokens on the board.  
- Shuffle plunderer cards and form the raider stack (on hill side).  
- Set aside lieutenant (5) and boss (6) cards for later rounds.  
- Each player chooses a samurai board, places meeple at 0, and takes support token.  
- Random player starts with active player marker.

**2-Player Variant**:  
- Ensure at least 2 family symbols among the 14 plunderer cards used.  
- Place 5 unused support tokens beside the board; usable once per game at turn start.  
- Solo: Use 2–3 samurai with 2-player rules.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
**Three Rounds**:  
- **Round 1**: Plunderers only.  
- **Round 2**: Add lieutenant cards (1 per player).  
- **Round 3**: Add boss cards (1 per player).  

On a player’s turn:  
1. **Apply Battle Penalty** from the top card in their combat line (right side).  
   - If unable to apply, suffer a wound.  
2. **Take One Action**:  
   - **Fight**: Draw top raider card. Choose:  
     - *Confront*: Place to the right (combat line). Update battle track.  
       - If total > Kiai value: destroy 1 barricade (or farm if none).  
       - If total = Kiai value: may activate Kiai power, then discard oldest card from combat line.  
     - *Defend*: Place to the left if it has hat, farm, or family symbol and no duplicate symbol already defended.  
   - **Support**: Give support token to another samurai. Move top raider card to intruder stack (gate side).  
     - Recipient gains talent use on their next turn; returns token afterward.  
   - **Pass**: Lay meeple flat. Out for the round.  
     - Mandatory if battle track exceeds Kiai value.  
     - Must still apply current battle penalty before passing.  
3. **Return Support Tokens**: All support tokens are returned after each turn, regardless of use.

Play continues clockwise until all players pass or raider stack is empty. Remaining raider cards go to intruder stack.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Battle Track & Kiai**:  
  - Total of right-side (combat line) cards determines meeple position.  
  - Reaching Kiai value exactly allows activation of Kiai power and removal of oldest combat card.  
  - Can trigger Kiai outside of turn (e.g., via penalty forcing draw).  
- **Wounds**:  
  - 1st wound: place wound marker.  
  - 2nd wound: transform to animal form (remove wound, flip board).  
  - 3rd wound: place wound on animal side.  
  - 4th wound: samurai dies → game lost.  
- **Talents**: Always available. Examples:  
  - Heihachi: Pass even cards to neighbors.  
  - Daisuke: Pass odd cards to neighbors.  
  - Gorobei: Ignore even-card penalties.  
  - Kanbei: Ignore odd-card penalties.  
  - Kikuchiyo: Fight twice.  
  - Kyuzo: Discard duplicate-value cards.  
  - Katsushiro: Replace drawn card once per draw.  
- **Penalties**:  
  - **Plunderers/Lieutenants**:  
    - Destroy barricade/farm  
    - Inflict wound  
    - Move top raider to intruder stack  
    - Block defend or support actions  
    - Force left/right neighbor to draw  
  - **Bosses**:  
    - Must pass  
    - Shuffle discard into raider stack  
    - Block talent/support use  
    - Discard a defended card  
    - Some have two penalties (order chosen by player).  
- **Intruder Deck**:  
  - Grows from support actions and passed-round leftovers.  
  - At round end, reveal cards: each flame removes 1 barricade (then farm, then family if needed).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Win Condition**: After Round 3, at least 1 farmstead and 1 family remain → victory.  
**Scoring**:  
- 1 point per surviving farm (max 6)  
- 1 point per surviving family (max 3)  
- 1 point if no samurai has wounds  
- Add difficulty modifier:  
  - Easy: +0  
  - Normal: +1  
  - Hard: +2  
  - Heroic: +3  

**End of Round Cleanup**:  
1. Undefended hat → 1 wound per samurai  
2. Undefended farm → remove random farm; apply penalty (Hard/Heroic only)  
3. Undefended family → remove random family  
4. Apply bonuses from surviving families:  
   - Remove random wound  
   - Add barricade (capped at starting number)  
   - Move top intruder card to discard  
5. Reveal intruder stack: each flame removes 1 barricade (then farm, then family)  
6. Reset:  
   - Collect all raider cards  
   - Add lieutenants (Round 2) or bosses (Round 3) to reform raider stack  
   - Reset meeples to 0  
   - Next active player starts new round

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use my talent when not my turn?** Yes, talents are always usable.  
- **Can I pass a card to a passed player?** No. Only active players can receive cards via talents.  
- **What happens if I exceed Kiai value?** You must pass on your *next* turn (unless transformed).  
- **Can I use a support token on myself?** No. Support tokens are given to others.  
- **Can I activate Kiai multiple times per turn?** Only if total hits Kiai again after discarding a card.  
- **Animal Form**: Grants enhanced talent effects; no return to human form.  
- **Barricade Cap**: Cannot exceed starting number, even via bonuses.  
- **Tie in Card Passing**: Heihachi/Daisuke can only pass to immediate neighbors.  
- **Kiai Activation Timing**: Can occur mid-turn (e.g., after penalty forces draw), interrupting normal flow.
