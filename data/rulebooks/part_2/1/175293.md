## Trambahn — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In late 19th-century Munich, two rival companies compete to expand and modernize the city’s tramway system. Players earn points by developing routes (columns) of station cards and triggering scorings through passenger placement and route development. The game ends after the 10th regular scoring. The player with the most total points (regular + extra tour scorings) wins. In case of a tie, the player with more money wins; if still tied, a rematch is played.

### 2. Components  
- 112 Station Cards (numbered 1–10, color-coded, back: 1,000 Marks)  
- 8 Conductor Cards (gray, back: 1,000 Marks)  
- 16 Tramway Cards:  
  - 5 Horse-drawn (value 2)  
  - 4 Steam-powered (value 3)  
  - 7 Electric (value 4)  
- 4 Terminal Station Cards (I, II, III, IV), each with a color: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue  
- Scoring Pad (for tracking scores)  
- Money pile and discard areas (using cards as currency)

### 3. Setup  
1. **Draw Pile**: Shuffle all 112 Station Cards and 8 Conductor Cards together. Place face down in the center.  
2. **Tramway Cards**: Sort by type and stack in order: Electric (bottom), Steam, Horse-drawn (top). This creates a single face-up stack. Reveal the top 3 Tramway Cards as the initial supply.  
3. **Starting Money**:  
   - Start Player draws 12 cards (12,000 Marks) to their money pile (unrevealed).  
   - Opponent draws 15 cards (15,000 Marks) to their money pile (unrevealed).  
4. **Hands**: Each player draws 6 cards from the draw pile into their hand.  
5. **Terminal Stations**: Place the 4 Terminal Cards (I–IV) in a vertical column with space to the right for passenger rows.  
6. **Player Areas**: Each player has space in front to build their route columns.  
7. **First Player**: The player who most recently used a tram starts.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in alternating order, performing the following steps in sequence:

#### 1. Place Passengers  
- Play 1 or 2 cards from hand as passengers.  
- Each card must be placed next to the Terminal Card of matching color.  
- Conductor Cards may be placed in any passenger row.  
- If a player places the **4th passenger** in any row:  
  - Immediately trigger **regular scoring** for that color.  
  - Both players score all columns of that color.  
  - After scoring, discard the 4 passenger cards.  
  - Player continues their turn after scoring resolution.  
- If two passenger placements both complete rows, resolve each scoring separately (counts as two scorings).

#### 2. Place Stations  
- Play any number of Station or Conductor Cards from hand into your tableau.  
- Cards are placed in **columns**, each of one color only.  
- Cards in a column must be in **ascending numerical order** (by station number, not VP).  
  - You may skip values.  
  - You may not play a card with the same number as the last card in the column.  
- You may start a new column at any time.  
- **Tramway Card Requirement**: A column must have a Tramway Card assigned to it by Step 5, or it will be converted to money.  
- **Conductor Cards**:  
  - Can be added to any incomplete column (not after a value 10 card).  
  - Placed **to the side** of the column (not in the sequence).  
  - Do not contribute VPs.  
  - Cannot start a new route.  
- **Extra Tour Trigger**: When the **8th card** (Station or Conductor) is added to a column:  
  - Immediately score that column as an **Extra Tour**.  
  - Only one Extra Tour per column.  
  - Tramway Card does **not** count toward the 8-card total.

#### 3. Income  
- Discard any number of cards from hand to your money pile (each = 1,000 Marks).  
- Cards added here can be used immediately for train purchases.

#### 4. Purchase Trains  
- Buy one or more Tramway Cards from the available display.  
- Pay using cards from your **money pile only**.  
  - Payment is **last-in, first-out** (top cards of pile).  
  - Paid cards go to a face-down discard pile.  
- After purchase:  
  - Immediately assign each Tramway Card to a **column without one**.  
  - Cannot assign to an empty column (must have at least one station card).  
  - Cannot replace an existing Tramway Card.  
  - Cannot hold Tramway Cards in hand or reserve them.  
- **Replenish supply only at end of turn** (after Step 5).  
- If supply runs out, no more trains can be bought.

#### 5. Draw New Cards  
- **Convert unpowered columns**: Move all cards from any column **without a Tramway Card** to your money pile.  
- Draw from the draw pile until you have **6 cards in hand**.  
- **If draw pile is empty**:  
  - Both players discard **half their money pile**, rounded down, to the discard pile.  
  - Shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.  
  - Continue play.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Passenger Rows**: 4 cards per color trigger scoring.  
- **Columns**: Player-built routes of stations in ascending order, by color.  
- **Tramway Cards**: Provide scoring multiplier and protect column from conversion.  
- **Scoring Triggers**:  
  - **Regular Scoring**: 4th passenger added to a Terminal row.  
  - **Extra Tour**: 8th card (Station or Conductor) added to a column.  
- **Money**: Cards function as currency. Only money pile cards can be spent.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Regular Scoring  
- Triggered when 4th passenger is placed in a Terminal row.  
- Both players score **all columns** of that color, even previously scored ones.  
- For each column:  
  - Sum **VPs** (brown background numbers) of all cards.  
  - Multiply by **Tramway Card value** (bottom left).  
- Record score. Discard the 4 passengers. Columns remain.  
- Counts toward the 10-scoring game end.

#### Extra Tour  
- Triggered when 8th card is added to a column.  
- Score only that one column:  
  - Sum VPs × Tramway Card value.  
- Record under "Extra Tours" on scoring pad.  
- Only one Extra Tour per column.  
- Does **not** count toward the 10 regular scorings.

#### Game End  
- Game ends **immediately** after the **10th regular scoring**.  
- Extra Tours do not end the game.  
- Final scoring:  
  - Add all regular scoring points.  
  - Add all Extra Tour points.  
- Highest total wins.  
- Tiebreaker:  
  1. Most money (cards in money pile).  
  2. If still tied, play again.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play two passengers that both trigger scoring?**  
  Yes. Resolve first scoring, then second. Counts as two regular scorings.  
- **Can I score a column with no Tramway Card?**  
  No. Only columns with a Tramway Card are scored.  
- **Can I have multiple columns of the same color?**  
  Yes, as long as each has its own Tramway Card.  
- **Do Conductors count toward Extra Tour?**  
  Yes. They count as cards in the column (but not toward VPs).  
- **Can I start a new column even if I could extend another?**  
  Yes. Optional to start new.  
- **What if I run out of Tramway Cards?**  
  No more can be purchased. Replenishment only happens if cards are bought and supply refilled.  
- **Can I use hand cards to pay for trains?**  
  No. Only cards in money pile.  
- **Do I discard my column if I don’t assign a Tramway Card?**  
  No. Cards go to money pile in Step 5. Column is lost but cards are saved.  
- **Can I trigger Extra Tour and regular scoring on same turn?**  
  Yes. Both can occur independently.
