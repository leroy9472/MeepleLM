# DEEP REGRETS  
## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Deep Regrets*, players are angler-scientists grappling with personal regrets while fishing in increasingly strange and dangerous waters. Inspired by the Hollow Earth theory of Edmund Halley and the disappearance of Rocabarraigh, the game blends psychological tension with strategic fishing. Players compete over six days to catch valuable Fish, manage their Madness, and suppress their Regrets.

**Objective:**  
Score the most points by catching and mounting Fish, selling hauls, and managing Fishbucks. At game end, the player with the highest total Regret Value must discard a mounted Fish. The player with the highest final score wins.

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Sea Actions
- **Fish:**  
  1. **Cast:** Choose Shoal at current or higher Depth. Reveal top Fish if face-down.  
  2. **Trigger:** Resolve any "Reveal" abilities.  
  3. **Pay:** Spend dice ≥ Fish’s Difficulty.  
     - Cannot afford/choose not to? Spend 1 die to draw 1 Dink instead.  
  4. **Catch:** Resolve "Catch" abilities. Take Fish into hand.  
  - **Overfishing:** Catching last Fish in a Shoal → draw 1 Regret.  
  - **Catching Dinks:** Spend 1 die instead of paying Difficulty → draw 1 Dink.  
- **Abandon Ship:**  
  Flip Lifeboat face-down → immediately Make Port. Only once per game.  
  - Grants +10 Regret Value at endgame.  
  - Does not count as Regret Card for Madness.

#### Port Actions
- **Sell Fish:** Discard any number. Gain Fishbucks = Value modified by Madness.  
  - Each Foul Fish sold → draw 1 Regret.  
- **Shop:** Visit each shop once per day:  
  - **Rod/Reel Shop:**  
    - 1$: Draw 1, keep it  
    - 3$: Draw 3, keep 1  
    - 5$: Draw 5, keep 2  
  - **Supply Shop:**  
    - 1$: Draw 1, keep it  
    - 3$: Draw 3, keep 2

    - Roll immediately; excess dice go to Spent Pool.  
- **Mount Fish:** Place up to 3 Fish from hand into empty trophy slots. Permanent. Multipliers: x2 or x3.

#### Free Actions (Sea or Port)
- Eat Fish (use "Eat" ability)  
- Use Can of Worms (peek at top Fish; return to top or bottom)  
- Use Life Preserver:  
  - At Sea: Reduce 1 Fish’s Difficulty by 2  
  - At Port: Reduce 1 Shop cost by 2  
- Use Dinks, Items, or Rod/Reel abilities  
- Drop Sinker: Spend 1 die → move down 1 Depth (lasts until next day)  
- Spend Life Preserver die effect: -2 or -2$

#### Make Port (Immediate)
When arriving at Port (via Declaration or Abandon Ship):

3. Discard 1 Regret (optional)

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Game Ends:**  
- After Saturday (final day), or  
- If Sea is empty.

#### Dealing with Regrets
- All players reveal Regret Values (sum of card fronts +10 if Lifeboat flipped).  
- Player(s) with **highest total Regret Value** must discard one mounted Fish:  
  - 2 players: discard **lowest-value** mounted Fish  
  - 3+ players: discard **highest-value** mounted Fish  

#### Scoring
1. **Fish in Hand:** Value modified by Madness level.  
2. **Mounted Fish:** (Value modified by Madness) × Mount multiplier (x2 or x3).  
3. **Fishbucks:** 1 point per 2 Fishbucks.

**Final Score =** Sum of above.

#### Tiebreaker
1. Lower total Regret Value  
2. Fewer Regret Cards  
3. Tie — “Stop being so competitive. Let it go.”

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

  - Number of Regret **cards** determines position.  
  - Regret **Value** (sum of fronts +10 if Lifeboat flipped) used only for endgame penalty.  
- **Max Dice:**  
  - Only checked when acquiring or refreshing dice.  
  - If Madness drops and Fresh Pool exceeds limit, keep dice until spent.  
- **Life Preserver Use:**  
  - Discard to reduce Fish Difficulty or Shop cost by 2.  
- **Can of Worms:**  
  - May be used before revealing Fish. Flip face-down after use.  
  - Refreshed on Wed/Fri (via Day effect) or when Making Port.  
- **Dinks:**  
  - Do not count toward Madness or scoring.  
  - Draw Dink only if Fish is revealed but not caught.

  - Difficulty ranges:  
    - Depth I: Small 1–2, Middling 2–3, Large 3–4  
    - Depth II: Small 2–3, Middling 3–4, Large 4–5  
    - Depth III: Small 3–4, Middling 4–5, Large 5–6
