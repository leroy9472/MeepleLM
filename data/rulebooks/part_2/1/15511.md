## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Fjords is a tile-laying and area-claiming game set in a rugged coastal landscape where players explore an undeveloped region defined by mountains, sea, and sparse farmland. During the exploration phase, players place landscape tiles and position farms on farmland regions. In the second phase, players expand their influence by claiming adjacent farmland with fields. The goal is to claim the most farmland by the end of the game.

The base game is played over three rounds. The winner is the player with the highest total score across all rounds. In case of a tie, the player who won more individual rounds wins. If still tied, an additional match is played.

### 2. Components  
- Landscape tiles (including 3 starting tiles with dark backs)  
- Farm tokens (4 per player)  
- Field tokens (20 per player)  
- Two-player game: 1 set of each component per player  

### 3. Setup  
- Each player takes 4 farm tokens and 20 field tokens.  
- Place the 3 starting tiles face-up to form the initial layout.  
- Shuffle the remaining landscape tiles and place them face-down.  
- Randomly determine the starting player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in two distinct phases over three rounds.

#### Phase 1: Discovery  
On a player’s turn:  
1. **Place a Tile**  
   - Draw either the top face-down tile or any face-up tile.  
   - Place it adjacent to at least two existing tiles.  
   - All landscape regions (mountain, farmland, sea) must match adjacent edges.  
   - The entire layout must remain one single contiguous landmass (not split by sea).  
   - Mountain and farmland regions have no special placement restrictions beyond edge matching.  
   - If no legal placement exists, set the tile aside face-up and repeat the tile draw.  
   - Opponents may challenge illegal placements.

2. **Optionally Place a Farm**  
   - A player may place one of their farms on a farmland region of the just-placed tile.  
   - Farms can only be placed on farmland, not on mountains or sea.  
   - Only one farm per tile; multiple farms from different players may occupy the same tile if space allows.

Phase 1 ends when all face-down tiles have been drawn and placed or set aside.

#### Phase 2: Land Taking  
- The player who would have drawn the next tile begins Phase 2.  
- On each turn, a player places one field token:  
  - Must be adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to one of their farms or one of their previously placed fields.  
  - Fields can only be placed on farmland regions.  
  - Mountains block field expansion — fields cannot be placed across mountains.  
- Players alternate placing fields until no legal placements remain.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Tile Placement**: Edge-matching with adjacency and land continuity rules.  
- **Farm Placement**: Limited to farmland on the tile just placed; optional action.  
- **Field Expansion**: Grows from farms or fields; blocked by mountains.  
- **Scoring**: Based on number of fields placed per player.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- After Phase 2 ends, count each player’s fields.  
- Record the score.  
- Repeat setup for a total of three rounds. The loser of the previous round becomes the starting player of the next.  
- After three rounds:  
  - Highest total field count wins.  
  - Tiebreaker: Player who won more rounds (i.e., scored more fields in that round).  
  - If still tied, play an additional match.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Unplayable Tiles**: Set aside face-up; cannot be reused.  
- **Challenges**: Opponents may challenge incorrect tile placements; if invalid, the placing player must correct or set aside.  
- **Multiple Farms on One Tile**: Allowed if the tile has multiple farmland sections.  
- **Diagonal Adjacency**: Allowed for field placement.  
- **Mountains as Barriers**: Prevent field expansion but do not block tile placement continuity (landmass must still be connected via land tiles, not sea).
