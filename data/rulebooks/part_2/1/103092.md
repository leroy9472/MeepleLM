### 1. Lore & Objective
In 19th-century Switzerland, players take on the role of village leaders rebuilding their communities after the Napoleonic era. The goal is to grow your village through building, marriage, and production, earning Victory Points (VPs) to reach 20 or more. The first player to achieve this at the end of a round wins.

### 2. Components
- 1 Game Board
- 54 Building Tiles (marked with letters, "1", "2", or "3" on back)
- 64 Wooden Villagers (16 per player in 4 colors; male/female; include "child" stickers)
- 24 Wooden Coins (6 per player)
- 68 Delivery Cubes (17 per player)
- 5 Character Tiles (Builder, Trader, Night Watchman, Priest, Midwife)
- 10 Goods Tiles
- 6 Special Victory Point Tiles
- 1 Starting Player Token
- 5 Village Center Tiles

### 3. Setup
**General Setup:**
- Place the board in the center.
- Sort building tiles:
  - Lettered tiles: Starting buildings (15 total; remove one of each type for 3 players, 5 for 2 players).
  - "1" tiles: Sort by type, place face-up.
  - "2" and "3" tiles: Shuffle separately, stack face-down ("2" on top of "3").
- Place 5 character tiles and 10 goods tiles on board; place 6 special VP tiles nearby.
- Each player takes:
  - 16 villagers (8 men, 8 women), 6 coins, 17 delivery cubes
  - 1 Village Center tile
  - Places 1 delivery cube on "0" of VP track

**Starting Building Selection (Advanced Variant):**
- Random starting player.
- First round: Starting player chooses first, others clockwise.
- Second round: Player to the right of starter chooses first, others anti-clockwise.
- Third round: Back to starting player, clockwise.
- No player may take two of the same building type.
- Last player to pick becomes first-round starter.

**Easy First-Time Play:**
- Randomly assign Village Center tiles (A–E); players take matching starting buildings.
- Remaining buildings and centers are removed.

**Initial Village Placement:**
- Each player takes 3 men and 3 women.
- Place in three phases (in turn order, anti-clockwise):
  1. Place a man and woman on any two of your buildings.
  2. Place one villager on remaining building; place one of opposite gender on School.
  3. Marry one villager into the village of the player to your left (must match opposite gender in a building); place final villager on your Village Center.

**Initial Coin Placement:**
- Each player gives 1 coin to each of the two players to their right.
- These coins are placed on the recipients’ Village Centers as dowry.
- Each player now has 4 coins and 2 foreign coins on their center.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Play proceeds in rounds. Rounds consist of turns taken anti-clockwise.
- On your turn:
  - Choose one of the 5 characters.
  - Place 1 or more coins on that character’s space (1 coin per action).
  - Perform corresponding actions (e.g., 2 coins = 2 builds, 2 deliveries, etc.).
- You must act if you have coins; you cannot pass.
- A player may use the same character multiple times in a round.
- The round ends when only one player has coins left (they do not get a turn).
- That player becomes the starting player for the next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics

**Builder:**
- 1 coin = build 1 building (from face-up pool).
- Pay building cost by producing required goods using awake villagers (in your or others’ villages).
- If missing wood, brick, or stone, pay 1 coin per missing good directly to Builder.
- Cannot build duplicate buildings.
- After building, move a villager from your Village Center into it if available.
- First player to fully surround Village Center with buildings: 4 VP; second: 2 VP (all non-VP buildings must be occupied).

**Trader:**
- 1 coin = deliver 1 good to Market.
- Place your delivery cube on the good’s space (each good can be delivered once per player).
- First to deliver a complex good takes its bonus tile (1–2 VP).
- Each delivery cube on Market = 1 VP.
- Complex goods require prerequisite goods to be produced in the same turn (but not necessarily delivered).

**Night Watchman:**
- 1 coin = wake all sleeping villagers in one quarter of any village.
- Quarters: top, bottom, left, right; left/right buildings count for both top and bottom.
- Wakes all villagers (any color) in the chosen quarter.

**Priest:**
- 1 coin = marry one unattached villager (from your School or Village Center) into another player’s village.
- Must place in a building with exactly one villager of opposite gender.
- If the host village has coins on its center, take one as dowry:
  - Your color: add to your supply (usable next turn).
  - Other color: place on your Village Center.
- You may choose which coin to take if multiple are available.

**Midwife:**
- 1 coin = one married couple in your village has one child.
- Choose gender; place new villager tipped on its side (child).
- A couple may have only one child per turn, but multiple per round if activated again.

**Character Tiles:**
- Awarded at end of round to player with most coins on each character space (tie: tile stays with current holder).
- Each tile is worth 1 VP and grants one free action with that character per round.
- Use before or after your regular action (not during).
- Only one character tile may be used per turn.
- Cannot use if you have no turns (no coins).
- If using Builder tile, may spend coins to buy missing goods.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End of Round Steps:**
1. **Award Character Tiles:** Player with most coins on each character space takes the tile.
2. **Return Coins:** All coins on character spaces go back to owners.
3. **Graduate from School:** Villagers in School move to their village:
   - Place in unoccupied buildings if possible.
   - Remaining villagers go to Village Center.
4. **Send Babies to School:** All children (from Midwife) go to School.
5. **Score Victory Points:**
   - 1 VP: Starting Player Token
   - 1 VP: Each delivery cube on Market
   - 1–2 VP: Each complex good bonus tile
   - 1 VP: Each character tile held
   - 3 VP: Each Victory Point building (Mill, Tavern, Town Hall, Church)
   - 1, 2, or 4 VP: Market bonus tiles (for completing rows/chains)
   - 4 or 2 VP: First or second to complete village (surround Village Center; all non-VP buildings must be occupied)
6. **Reveal New Buildings:** Flip 5 new building tiles from "2" deck (then "3" deck when "2" is empty).

**End Game:**
- Game ends immediately after scoring if any player has ≥20 VP.
- Highest score wins.
- Tie: player with most awake villagers (standing) across all villages wins.
- Still tied: players share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use a character tile if I have no coins?** No. You must have a turn to use a tile.
- **Can I use multiple character tiles in one turn?** No. Only one per turn.
- **Can I use the same character with coins and tile in one turn?** Yes. Actions are combined.
- **Can I produce goods from another player’s building?** Yes, if you have an awake villager there.
- **Do villagers ever leave buildings?** No. Once placed, they stay unless married out (only unattached villagers can be married).
- **Can I deliver a complex good without its prerequisite?** Yes, as long as you produce the prerequisite in the same turn (not necessarily deliver it).
- **Can I buy goods with the Trader?** No. Only Builder allows purchasing goods.
- **Do VP buildings count toward village completion?** Yes. They count even without villagers.
- **Can a couple have more than one child per round?** Yes, if you use Midwife multiple times.
