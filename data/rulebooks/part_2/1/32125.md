## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Players use their mice to capture Felix (or Felicity), the famous cat in the sack. Each round, players place pet cards face down into a shared row—the "cats in the sack"—which is then auctioned off. The goal is to acquire high-value cats (positive points), avoid bad cats (negative points), and manage mice money wisely. Dogs can be used strategically to remove undesirable cats, but multiple dogs cancel each other out. At game end, the player with the highest total score from cats and remaining mice wins.

### 2. Components
- 50 Pet Cards (5 sets of 10):  
  - Cats: -8, -5, 3, 5, 8, 11, 15 (values in yellow for positive, red for negative)  
  - Rabbits: 0 points  
  - Dogs: Large and Small (used to remove cats from the sack)  
- 4 Mouse Cards: valued at 2, 3, 4, and 6 mice  
- 1 "Cat in the Sack" card  
- 1 Start Player Marker  
- 76 Mice Money:  
  - 68 black mice (1 point each)  
  - 8 green mice (5 points each)

### 3. Setup
#### For 4 or 5 Players:
- Each player takes one full set of 10 pet cards in their color.
- Each player randomly discards one card from the player to their right (face down, unseen) into the box.
- Each player receives 15 mice money: 1 green (5) and 10 black (1).
- Remaining mice form the bank:  
  - 4 players: 27 mice in bank  
  - 5 players: 33 mice in bank  
  - Return excess to box.
- Place Mouse Cards in numerical order (2, 3, 4, 6) on the table. For 4 players, return the 3 Mouse Card to the box.
- Place the "Cat in the Sack" card to the left of the 2 Mouse Card.
- Place mice money on each Mouse Card equal to its value (e.g., 6 mice on the 6 Mouse Card).
- Return unused player card sets to the box.
- Choose a starting player and give them the Start Player Marker.

#### For 3 Players:
- Use only the 3 and 6 Mouse Cards; place "Cat in the Sack" card to the left of the 3 Mouse Card.
- Bank contains 21 mice; return the rest to the box.
- Take a fourth (neutral) card set, shuffle face down, remove one card at random (without looking), and return it to the box.
- Place the remaining 9 cards face down under the "Cat in the Sack" card as a dummy player.
- Setup forms a row: dummy → start player → player 2 → player 3.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game consists of 9 rounds. Each round proceeds as follows:

1. **Card Selection Phase**  
   Starting with the current start player and proceeding clockwise, each player selects one pet card from their hand and places it face down in the row under the corresponding Mouse Card (or "Cat in the Sack" for start player).

2. **Auction Phase**
   - The start player turns over their card (leftmost in the row).
   - The start player begins bidding by placing any positive amount of mice money (not zero) in front of them, or they may pass.
   - Play proceeds clockwise. Each player must either:
     - Bid more mice than the current highest bid, or
     - Pass.
   - If a player has already bid and the turn returns to them, they must increase their bid or pass.
   - When a player passes:
     - They take back all their bid mice.
     - They collect the mice on the lowest-numbered Mouse Card still in play.
     - They are out of the auction.
     - The next face-down card in the row is revealed (left to right).
   - Continue until only one player remains.

3. **Resolution Phase**
   - The last remaining player pays their bid to the bank.
   - They take all pet cards from the row.
   - **Dog Effect**:  
     - If exactly **one dog** is revealed:
       - **Large dog**: removes the highest positive-value cat and itself from the game.
       - **Small dog**: removes the highest negative-value cat and itself from the game.
     - If **two or more dogs** (any combination) are revealed, all dogs are returned to the box with no effect.
   - The winner takes the Start Player Marker.
   - Remaining cards (after dog effects) go to the winner’s personal collection (not hand).

4. **Reset Phase**
   - Refill Mouse Cards with mice equal to their value, using the bank.
   - If insufficient mice in the bank to refill all cards, skip refilling entirely—only the auction winner gets value this round.
   - Begin next round.

#### 3-Player Specific Rules:
- Before bidding starts, reveal the top card of the dummy player’s stack.
- After a player passes, reveal the start player’s card.
- When only one player remains, reveal the last two face-down cards.
- In the special case where all but one pass early:
  - Reveal the final card(s): one for 4/5 players, two for 3 players.
  - The last player may buy the entire sack for 1 mouse after resolving dog effects.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Bluffing & Hidden Information**: Players don’t know what cards others place in the sack.
- **Auction Dynamics**: Increasing blind-bid auction with progressive information (cards revealed as players pass).
- **Risk Management**: Spending mice early may leave you unable to compete later.
- **Dog Strategy**: Dogs can remove high-value positive or negative cats, depending on type and context.
- **Money Management**: Players may make change with the bank at any time.
- **Secrecy**: Mice money must be kept hidden throughout the game.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- The game ends after the 9th round (all cards played).
- Each player scores:
  - Sum of values on **cat cards** they won (positive and negative).
  - Plus total **mice money** still in hand (each mouse = 1 point).
- Rabbits and dogs are worth 0 and do not count.
- **Winning**: Highest total score wins.
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with higher cat points wins. If still tied, tie remains unresolved (rules do not specify further).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **All players pass except one**:
  - Reveal all remaining cards.
  - The last player may buy the sack for **1 mouse**, after dog effects.
- **Last player also passes**:
  - Remove all cards from the row.
  - Start new round with same start player.
  - No mice are placed on Mouse Cards this round.
- **Dog effects with no matching cats**:
  - **Large dog, no positive cats**: removes the **least negative** (highest value) negative cat (e.g., -5 instead of -8).
  - **Small dog, no negative cats**: removes the **lowest positive** cat (e.g., 3 instead of 15).
- **Insufficient bank**:
  - If bank lacks enough mice to refill all Mouse Cards, skip refilling entirely.
  - Only auction winner gains value; passers get no mice.
- **Change**:
  - Players may exchange mice with the bank at any time.
- **Secret Money**:
  - All mice money must remain hidden from opponents during play.
