## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   - Objective: Achieve total global domination by scoring 15 victory points (VP). The first player to reach 15 VP wins.

2. **Components**  
   - 4 factions (20 cards each, 80 cards total)  
   - 8 base cards  
   - 1 VP token sheet  
   - 30 Madness Cards  
   - Rulebook  

3. **Setup**  
   - Each player selects two different 20-card factions and shuffles them into a 40-card deck.  
   - Shuffle all base cards into a deck.  
   - Place one base per player plus one (e.g., 4 bases for 3 players) face up in the center.  
   - Each player draws 5 cards.  
     - If a player has no minions in their opening hand, they may reveal it, discard it, and draw a new 5-card hand. The second hand must be kept.  
   - Determine first player (e.g., whoever woke up earliest). Play proceeds clockwise.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   Each turn has five phases:  
   1. **Crank It Up**: Resolve any abilities that trigger at the start of your turn.  
   2. **Play Cards**:  
      - Play one minion, one action, or one of each (in any order).  
      - Playing a card means placing it from your hand; abilities trigger when played.  
      - "Extra" cards (from abilities) allow playing beyond the normal limit.  
      - Moving or returning a minion is not "playing" it.  
   3. **Check for Scoring**:  
      - If any base has total minion power ≥ its breakpoint, it is ready to score.  
      - The current player chooses which base to score first if multiple qualify.  
   4. **Draw 2 Cards**:  
      - Draw 2 cards. Maximum hand size is 10; discard excess if needed.  
      - If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form a new deck.  
   5. **Shut It Down**:  
      - Resolve end-of-turn abilities.  
      - Pass turn to the left.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Minions**:  
     - Played beside a base; contribute power to that base.  
     - Card text (especially "Special" abilities) resolves when played.  
   - **Actions**:  
     - Played from hand; resolve effect and discard unless Ongoing.  
   - **Special Abilities**:  
     - Can be used at specified times, even on other players’ turns.  
     - If multiple players want to use Specials before or after scoring, start with current player and go clockwise; players may pass and re-engage if others act.  
   - **Ongoing**: Persistent effects as long as the card is in play.  
   - **Talent**: Usable once per turn during your turn.  
   - **Moving/Returning/Destroying**:  
     - Move: Relocate a card; does not trigger abilities.  
     - Return: Send card back to origin (e.g., hand or deck); attachments are discarded.  
     - Destroy: Send card to owner’s discard pile.  
   - **Discard**: Card goes to owner’s discard pile, regardless of controller.  
   - **Madness Cards**:  
     - Form a separate 30-card deck; not drawn unless a card instructs it.  
     - Once in a player’s possession (hand, deck, discard), treated like a normal action card.  
     - At game end, each player counts their Madness cards.  
     - Penalty: -1 VP for every 2 Madness cards (rounded down).  
     - Example: 5 Madness cards → -2 VP.  
     - After scoring, all Madness cards are returned to the Madness deck.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - **Scoring a Base**:  
     - Triggered when total power ≥ base’s breakpoint.  
     - Current player selects which base to score if multiple qualify.  
     - Before scoring: Players may use "before" Special abilities.  
     - Even if power drops below breakpoint during resolution, scoring continues.  
   - **Awarding VP**:  
     - 1st place (most power): VP on left of base.  
     - 2nd place: middle VP.  
     - 3rd place: right VP.  
     - Must have at least one minion on base to score.  
   - **Ties**:  
     - Players tied for a position each receive the higher VP.  
     - Example: Three players with 10, 10, and 5 power → two 1st place (left VP), one 3rd place (right VP). No 2nd place awarded.  
     - Ties for base ability: All tied players may use it.  
   - **After Scoring**:  
     - Resolve "after" Special abilities.  
     - All minions and attachments on base go to their owners’ discard piles.  
     - Scored base is discarded; replaced with top card of base deck (if any).  
     - Recheck for scoring; repeat if needed.  
   - **Winning**:  
     - After any turn, if a player has ≥15 VP, they win.  
     - If multiple players have ≥15 VP, the one with the most wins.  
     - If tied for highest VP, play continues until the tie is broken.  
     - Apply Madness card penalty **after** VP are tallied; final VP determines winner.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Card vs. Rule Conflict**: Card text always overrides rulebook.  
   - **Ability Conflicts**: "Cannot" beats "can."  
   - **Simultaneous Effects**: Current player chooses order.  
   - **Unplayable Abilities**: You may play a card even if its ability can’t resolve (e.g., destroy a minion when none exist).  
   - **Optional Effects**: "May" means choice; "must" means mandatory.  
   - **"Any number"**: Includes zero.  
   - **"All" with no targets**: Still playable.  
   - **Extra Cards During Scoring**: Must be played immediately or not at all.  
   - **Discard Piles**: Any player may inspect any discard pile at any time.  
   - **Madness Card Origin**: Discarded Madness cards go to player’s discard pile unless a card specifies returning to Madness deck (e.g., Miskatonic University base).
