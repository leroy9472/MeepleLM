### 3. Setup  
1. **Sort Cards by Type**:  
   - Separate all cards by type (A, B, C, D, E, S, U, and unlabeled public cards).  
   - U cards are "Dive" cards; public cards are Museums (4), Private Collectors, Guide Work.

2. **Place Reputation Board**:  
   - Center on table. Place U cards face-up in numerical order (2+ on top, 19+ on bottom).

3. **Public Cards**:  
   - Place Museums, Private Collectors, and Guide Work face-up above the board.  
   - Museums: Use 6-box side for 2 players; 9-box side for 3–4 players.

4. **Asset Card Decks**:  
   - Shuffle A, B, C decks; place face-up under board with "Lv1" side up.  
   - Deal top 3 cards from each into a row beside the deck (4 visible per row: 3 dealt + 1 deck top).  
   - Place D and E decks to the right of the board, "Lv1" side up.

5. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player takes one set of S cards: Desert Expedition, Canyon Expedition, Headquarters, Adventurers.  
   - Place all four S cards in a row, "Lv1" side up. This forms the starting "top row".  
   - Each player receives cubes of one color.  
   - Players may look at "Lv2" sides before placing cards; once placed, cards cannot be moved.

6. **Starting Player & Money**:  
   - Determine first player (e.g., highest dice roll).  
   - Starting player receives $2; 2nd/3rd players receive $3; 4th player receives $4.  
   - Each player places a cube on the Reputation Board to track score.

7. **Supply**:  
   - Place dice and dollar tokens near the board.  
   - Note: Money and cubes are unlimited; substitute if supply runs out.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Play proceeds clockwise starting with the first player.  
2. On a turn:  
   a. **Roll Dice**: Number of dice = total adventurer dice symbols on owned cards.  
   b. **Place Dice**: Assign dice to actions on owned cards, public cards, or the "Dive" space.  
   c. **Resolve Actions Immediately**: Each die triggers its action as placed.  
   d. **End Turn**: Remove all dice. Pass to next player.  
3. Game ends when a player reaches 20 VP. All other players complete their turns (equal turns).  
4. Final scoring occurs after last player's turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Dice Placement Rules  
- One die per action space unless otherwise noted.  
- Die must match the symbol:  
  - Exact number required if no "+" sign.  
  - Number **or higher** if "+" sign (e.g., "3+" accepts 3, 4, 5, 6).  
- **Dive Action Only**: Multiple dice may be summed to meet or exceed the top U card value.  
- **Truck Card**: Allows re-roll of one die after initial roll.  

#### Action Types  
**Expedition (Asset Card)**  
- Place die on die symbol to gain one artifact (type shown on card).  
- Represent artifact with a cube on the card.  
- No limit on number of artifacts per card.  

**Buy (Asset Card)**  
- Pay cost (in $, or $ + Scroll) to:  
  - **Purchase** a new A/B/C/D/E card (from face-up row or top of deck).  
  - **Upgrade** an existing asset card to "Lv2" by paying cost again.  
- Cost is in upper-right corner.  
- **Manager Card**: Reduces cost by $1 per purchase/upgrade.  
- When upgrading:  
  - Flip card to Lv2 side; keep dice/cubes on it.  
  - Gain only the **difference in VP** between Lv1 and Lv2.  
- New cards must be placed adjacent (orthogonally) to an existing owned card in either top or bottom row.  
- Refill empty public card spaces immediately from deck.  

**Museums (Public Card)**  
- Place one die to sell matching artifacts (e.g., 3 Fossils).  
- Choose one available order (e.g., "3") and discard that many matching artifacts.  
- Gain $1 per artifact sold + one-time bonus (shown top-left of card).  
- Place one cube on the completed order box (blocks it for rest of game).  
- **Curator Card**: +$1 per artifact sold here.  

**Guide Work (Public Card)**  
- Gain $1 for each die placed here.  

**Private Collectors (Public Card)**  
- Sell any number and mix of artifacts.  
- Gain $1 per artifact + $1 for each **additional type** beyond the first.  
  - Example: Selling 2 Scrolls and 1 Fossil = $3 + $1 (for 2 types) = $4.  

**Dive (Reputation Board)**  
- Sum one or more dice ≥ value of top U card.  
- Gain the U card (only 1 per turn).  
- U cards are placed off to the side (not in card rows).  
- Gain 1 VP immediately.  
- U cards grant special finds (Pottery, Doubloons, Sunken City) that may give bonus VP via certain asset cards.  

#### Scoring Triggers  
- VP from card purchases/upgrades is scored **immediately**.  
- VP from bottom-of-card effects (e.g., "Gain 1 VP per adjacent Expedition") are evaluated **immediately** when die is placed.  
- Adjacency is orthogonal only (not diagonal).  
- Digger Team: Cannot change a die showing 1 to 6, or 6 to 1.

#### Card Rows  
- Players build a 2-row grid of asset cards.  
- Starting S cards form initial "top row".  
- New cards must be placed adjacent (orthogonally) to an existing owned card.  
- Cards cannot be moved once placed.  
- U cards are **not** placed in rows.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
1. **Game End**: Triggered when a player reaches 20 VP. All players complete the current round (equal turns).  
2. **Final Scoring**:  
   - **Museum Majorities**: For each Museum card, the player with the most cubes on its order boxes gains the VP shown in top-right.  
     - Tie: Player with a cube in the **highest-numbered** (i.e., rightmost) box wins. Boxes are numbered left to right, top to bottom.  
   - Include **Adventurer/Archaeologist** museum majority bonuses if owned.  
3. **Total VP**: Sum all VP from:  
   - Owned cards (face-up side)  
   - U cards (1 VP each)  
   - Museum majority bonuses  
   - Other permanent bonuses  
4. **Winner**: Highest total VP wins.  
   - **Tie**: Player with the most money wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I look at Lv2 side before buying?** Yes, after placing a die on a Buy action, you may inspect any available card’s Lv2 side.  
- **Can I upgrade a card without buying a new one?** Yes, using the Buy action on a card you already own.  
- **Do artifacts expire?** No. Artifacts (cubes on expedition cards) remain until spent for sales.  
- **Can I use the same die for multiple actions?** No. One die per action space.  
- **Can I place dice on public cards even if I don’t own expeditions?** Yes.  
- **Can I use multiple dice on a single Buy action?** No. Only one die per Buy symbol unless card specifies otherwise.  
- **Can I dive multiple times per turn?** No. Only one U card per turn.  
- **Do cubes on museums count toward ownership for adjacency?** No. Museum cards are public and not part of player card grids.  
- **Is VP total during game visible?** Yes. A player’s VP is the sum of VP icons on their face-up cards and U cards. Track with the score marker.
