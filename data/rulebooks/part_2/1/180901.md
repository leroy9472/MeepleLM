### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **three rounds**. Each round has three phases:

#### Recruit → Skirmish → Prestige

---

### 4.1 Recruit Phase  
1. Shuffle all Skirmish Cards.  
2. Deal cards based on player count:  
   - 3 players: 6 cards each  
   - 4 players: 5 cards each  
3. Set aside unused cards face-down (not used this round).  
4. All players simultaneously choose **two cards** from their hand and pass them face-down to the player on their left.  
5. Players may now view their full hands.

---

### 4.2 Skirmish Phase  
Repeat the following until all cards are played:

1. **Card Play Order**: Starting with the current starting player, players take turns clockwise playing one card.  
2. **Following Suit**:  
   - The starting player may play any card.  
   - Subsequent players must follow suit if able.  
   - If unable to follow suit, any card may be played.  
3. **Resolve Effect Immediately**: When a card is played, resolve its effect before the next play.  

#### Skirmish Card Effects:
- **Ninja Card**: Take 0–3 Samurai from your supply and place them in any area(s), including Kyoto.  
- **Numbered Cards (1–6)**: Choose **one** of the following:  
  - **A. Placement**: Place 0–3 Samurai tokens **all into the area matching the card’s number**.  
  - **B. Action Points (AP)**: Gain AP equal to the card’s number. Spend immediately using the Action Chart:  
    - Move Daimyo 1 area: 2 AP  
    - Move 1 Samurai 1 area: 1 AP  
    - Remove 1 enemy Samurai: 1 AP  
    *(Unused AP is lost.)*

4. **Determine Skirmish Winner** after all players have played a card:  
   - Highest-numbered card wins (regardless of suit).  
   - **Exception**: If any player played a **6**, the **Ninja card wins** the skirmish.  
   - **Tiebreaker**: If tied for highest value, the player who played **last** wins.  
5. **Winner Takes**:  
   - The Kachidoki Card.  
   - Becomes starting player for next skirmish.  
   - Triggers **Kachidoki Scoring** in the area where their Daimyo token is located.

#### Kachidoki Scoring:
- Compare influence in the winner’s Daimyo’s area:  
  - Daimyo token = 2 influence  
  - Samurai token = 1 influence  
- Rank players by influence. In case of a tie, all tied players receive the **lower** rank.  
- Award RP using the Kachidoki scoring table:  
  - 1st: 3 RP  
  - 2nd: 2 RP  
  - 3rd: 1 RP  
  - 4th: 0 RP  
- All players in the area gain RP based on their rank.

---

### 4.3 Prestige Phase  
Score all areas from **#6 Shinano** down to **Kyoto** (in descending order):

1. For each area, calculate total influence:  
   - Daimyo = 2 points  
   - Samurai = 1 point  
2. Rank players by influence. Tied players receive the **lower** rank.  
3. Award RP using the **current round’s scoring row** (Round 1 = top row, Round 2 = middle, Round 3 = bottom).  
4. Move Daimyo tokens on the RP Track accordingly.  
5. **Do not remove or reposition** any tokens from the map. They remain for future rounds.

---

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Trick-Taking with Area Control**: Players play cards in tricks, but victory is determined by influence on the map.  
- **Action Economy**: Numbered cards offer flexibility between troop deployment and movement/removal via AP.  
- **Strategic Passing**: Two-card pass in Recruit Phase enables hand shaping and disruption.  
- **Kachidoki Incentive**: Winning tricks rewards immediate RP and turn order control.  
- **Influence Ties**: Always resolved in favor of lower rank.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after **three full rounds**.  
- Player with **most RP** wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Highest-numbered Daimyo Card.
