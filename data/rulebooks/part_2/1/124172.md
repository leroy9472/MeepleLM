## Tsuro of the Seas – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Tsuro of the Seas is a game of survival on mystical waters teeming with giant sea monsters known as daikaiju. Players command Imperial Japanese Red Seal Ships, navigating a grid-based board by placing wake tiles to extend their paths. The objective is to be the last player with a ship remaining on the board. A player is eliminated if their ship is destroyed by a daikaiju, exits the board, or collides with another ship.

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board (grid with gold and blue edge numbering)  
- 56 wake tiles (each with four connecting lines forming eight endpoints)  
- 10 daikaiju tiles (giant monster tokens, each with movement arrows and a rotation number)  
- 8 player ships (Imperial Japanese Red Seal Ships, each a unique color)  
- 2 dice: 1 gold, 1 blue  
- Expansion components (Veterans of the Seas):  
  - Tsunami tiles (2: one gold-arrowed, one blue-arrowed)  
  - Mystic portal wake tiles  
  - Taihou (cannon) tiles  
- Bonus tile (Phoenix Wake Tile): allows a forced reroll  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the game board in the center.  
2. Shuffle the 56 wake tiles and deal 3 to each player. The remainder form the draw pile, placed face down.  
3. Each player chooses a ship and places it on any white starting hash along the board’s edge (2 per side).  
4. Shuffle the 10 daikaiju tiles and place face down.  
5. Determine starting daikaiju count:  
   - 2–4 players: 6 daikaiju  
   - 5–6 players: 5 daikaiju  
   - 7–8 players: 4 daikaiju  
6. For each daikaiju:  
   a. Roll the gold and blue dice.  
   b. Place the daikaiju on the grid square at the intersection of the gold (top) and blue (left) numbers.  
   c. Re-roll if the space is already occupied.  
   d. Randomly rotate the tile and flip it face up.  
7. (V) Set aside the blue-arrowed tsunami tile. It is not placed at setup.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On each turn, the active player performs the following steps in order:

#### 1. Tsunami Phase (V only, if tsunami is in play)  
a. Move the gold-arrowed tsunami 1 space toward the blue-arrowed tsunami. It ignores other tiles.  
b. If the tsunami moves off the board, remove both tsunami tiles from the game.  
c. If the "connecting number" between the two tsunami tiles is not yet 4, rotate both to the next number (2 → 3 → 3 → 4).  
d. For each ship in the row perpendicular to the line between the tsunami tiles and containing the gold-arrowed tile:  
   - Owner rolls a die.  
   - If roll < connecting number, the ship is eliminated.  

#### 2. Daikaiju Check  
If fewer than 3 daikaiju are on the board, bring new daikaiju into play until there are 3.  
Otherwise, proceed to roll.  

#### 3. Dice Roll & Daikaiju Movement  
a. Roll both gold and blue dice.  
b. On a total of 6, 7, or 8:  
   i. Roll one die.  
   ii. On a 6: Bring a new daikaiju into play (see below).  
   iii. On 1–5: Move each daikaiju in ascending order by rotation number. For ties, gold daikaiju move before blue.  
       - Move the daikaiju in the direction of the arrow matching the die roll.  
       - If it moves off the board: tuck it face down under the daikaiju deck.  
       - If it lands on a wake tile: remove the wake tile and any ships on it; tuck tile under draw pile.  
       - If it lands adjacent to the active player’s ship: the player loses unless they discard a taihou (cannon) to tuck the daikaiju under the deck.  
       - If it lands adjacent to another player’s ship: no effect (yet).  
       - If it lands on another daikaiju: the stationary one is defeated; tuck it under the deck.  
c. (V) On any other roll (not 6–8), the uzushio (wave) may move per normal daikaiju movement rules.  

#### 4. Daikaiju Adjacent to Your Ship?  
- If this is your first turn: relocate your ship to a different starting hash on the same edge (if space is empty).  
- Otherwise: you lose unless you discard a taihou to tuck the daikaiju under the deck.  

#### 5. Place a Wake Tile  
- Place a wake tile adjacent to your ship, extending its path.  
- You may rotate the tile freely.  
- You may not:  
  - Run your ship off the board (unless no other option)  
  - Create an infinite loop (unless no other option)  
  - Connect your ship to a daikaiju (unless no other option)  
  - Cause two ships to follow the same wake in the same direction  
- (V) Option: Instead of placing a tile, discard a taihou to remove a daikaiju adjacent to your intended wake tile and tuck it under the deck.  
- (V) Alternative: Place a mystic portal tile instead of a wake tile.  

#### 6. Move Ships  
All ships touching the newly placed tile move along their wake lines until they reach:  
- Empty space: stop.  
- Another ship: both ships are eliminated.  
- Edge of board: ship is eliminated.  
- Daikaiju: ship is eliminated. (V) Player may discard a taihou to instead tuck the daikaiju under the deck.  
- (V) Tsunami: each time a ship enters the row perpendicular to the tsunami line (containing gold-arrowed tile), roll a die. If roll < connecting number, ship is eliminated.  

When a player is eliminated:  
- The active player may take up to that number of tiles from the eliminated player’s hand.  
- The active player keeps only 2 tiles total; excess go to the bottom of the draw pile.  

#### 7. Mystic Portal Tile (V only)  
If a mystic portal tile was placed:  
a. For each ship adjacent to the portal, in turn order (ending with active player):  
   i. Roll dice for coordinates.  
   ii. If space has a daikaiju: ship is eliminated.  
   iii. If space is empty: place a wake tile from hand there.  
   iv. Choose a wake line on the tile to start; follow movement rules. (Cannot reuse same starting point as earlier in this step.)  
b. For each daikaiju adjacent to the portal: bring it into play anew (reroll location, random orientation).  

#### 8. Replenish Hand  
Draw wake tiles to restore hand to 3.  
- (V) If you draw a taihou (cannon) tile:  
   - If you now have 3 taihou, or choose not to keep it: show it, remove it from the game, and draw a replacement.  
   - Otherwise, keep it.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Bringing a Daikaiju into Play  
1. Roll gold and blue dice for coordinates. Re-roll if occupied.  
2. Randomly rotate the daikaiju tile.  
3. Flip it face up and place it.  
4. If space has a wake tile: remove tile and any ships on it; tuck tile under draw pile.  
5. (V) For tsunami:  
   - Place blue-arrowed tsunami at board edge.  
   - Point its 2 toward the gold-arrowed tsunami’s 2.  
   - Record which player brought it in.  

#### Phoenix Wake Tile (BT)  
- May be discarded at any time after a die roll to force a reroll.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when only one ship remains. That player wins.  
- If two or more ships are eliminated simultaneously and are the last remaining, they tie.  
- If all remaining players are eliminated on the same turn, they tie.  
- No scoring; elimination-based win condition.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I place a wake tile that connects to a daikaiju if it’s my only option?**  
  A: Yes. Self-elimination is allowed only when no legal move exists.  

- **Q: What if a daikaiju move prevents my first move?**  
  A: Move your ship to another starting hash on the same edge, if unoccupied.  

- **Q: Can two ships share a wake tile without colliding?**  
  A: Yes, as long as they travel in opposite directions or are side-by-side. They only collide if moving in the same direction on the same wake.  

- **Q: Can I use a taihou to save another player’s ship?**  
  A: No. Taihou can only be used to save your own ship or remove a threat to your own placement.  

- **Q: What happens to removed wake tiles?**  
  A: They are returned to the bottom of the draw pile unless removed during elimination (then they go to eliminated player’s hand or are discarded).  

- **Q: Can the tsunami be reactivated after being removed?**  
  A: No. Once removed, it stays out for the rest of the game.
