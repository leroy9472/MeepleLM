## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the aftermath of a devastating war, the United States lies in ruins. Four factions—New York, the Appalachian Federation, the Merchants' Guild, and the Mutants' Union—compete to rebuild civilization and establish dominance by forming the new 51st State.  
**Objective**: Be the first to reach or exceed 30 Victory Points (VPs). If multiple players reach 30 VPs in the same turn, the player with the highest total at the end of that turn wins.

2. Components

- 22 Worker tokens  
- 68 Resource tokens:  
  - Scrap  
  - Weapons  
  - Fuel  
  - Building Material  
  - Universal Resource  
- 47 Victory Point (VP) tokens (values: 1 and 2)

  - Incorporation  
  - Universal  
- 4 Redevelopment tokens

3. Setup  
- Each player:  
  - Randomly selects a faction.  
  - Takes the corresponding Base card and 3 Permanent Contact cards.  
  - Places one faction marker on the 0 space of the VP track; keeps 3 nearby.  
- Shuffle all remaining cards (Locations, Leaders, Contacts) into a draw deck.  
- Deal 4 cards to each player.  
- Place the draw deck in the center.  
- Reveal 5 cards face-up in the Lookout Area.  
- Youngest player starts; pass first player token clockwise each turn.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn proceeds in five phases:  
1. **Lookout**  
2. **Production**  
3. **Actions**  
4. **VP Count**  
5. **Clean-up**

5. Core Mechanics  
**Resources**:  
- Scrap, Weapons, Fuel, Building Material, Universal Resource.  
- Universal Resource substitutes for any one basic resource.  

**Phases**:  
- **Lookout**:  
  - 3 rounds:  
    1. Players choose 1 from 5 revealed cards (Start player picks first).  
    2. Players choose 1 from remaining 3 (last player picks from 2).  
    3. Each draws 1 card blindly from the deck.  
  - Replenish revealed cards if fewer than 4 or 3 are available.  
  - Hand limit: 10 cards. Excess drawn cards are discarded immediately.  

- **Production**:  
  - Players gain:  
    - 3 Workers + 1 Resource (based on Base card) from Base.  
    - Resources from Deals (blue part) and Locations (center part).  
    - Resources from discarded Spoils (red part) — must discard during this phase.  
  - Tokens are taken from the common pool.  
  - Universal Resource can be saved and assigned later.  

- **Actions**:  
  - Players take turns performing one action each until all pass.  
  - Available actions:  
    1. **Conquer a Location**:  
       - Play Contact card/token with Conquest Range ≥ Location’s Distance.  
       - Pay cost in Weapons.  
       - Tuck card under Base; red part visible = Spoils.  
    2. **Establish Negotiation**:  
       - Use Negotiation Range ≥ Distance.  
       - Pay cost in Fuel.  
       - Tuck card under Base; blue part visible = Deal.  
    3. **Incorporate a Location**:  
       - Use Incorporation Range ≥ Distance.  
       - Pay cost in Scrap.  
       - Place card next to Base; center part active = Location (worth 1 VP).  
    4. **Redevelop a Location**:  
       - Discard an existing Location.  
       - New Location must share ≥1 Card Type icon.  
       - Pay 1 Building Material (or Redevelopment token for additional actions).  
       - Ignore Distance.  
       - Gain 2 VP (1 for new Location, 1 for action).  
       - Move resources/VPs from old card to Base.  
    5. **Play or Swap Leader**:  
       - Play new Leader: free if none in play.  
       - Swap Leader: spend 1 Weapons, gain 2 VP (1 for new Leader, 1 for swap).  
       - Move VPs from old Leader to Base.  
       - Max 1 Leader per player; holds up to 5 VP tokens.  
    6. **Discard 2 cards → draw 1**.  
    7. **Send Worker to own Location**:  
       - Spend 1 Worker (2 for some cards) to activate Action.  
       - Can activate same Location twice: 2 Workers (3 if required).  
    8. **Send Worker to opponent’s Location (Open Production only)**:  
       - Spend 1 Worker → give to opponent.  
       - Place your faction token on card.  
       - Gain production from that Location.  
       - Max 3 opponent Locations used per turn; each only once.  
    9. **Send 2 Workers for 1 Resource**:  
       - Discard 2 Workers → gain any basic resource.  
    10. **Leader Action (Baby Swift only)**:  
        - Discard 2 cards → gain 1 VP.  
        - Can be done multiple times per turn; no Worker cost.  

- **VP Count**:  
  - Total VPs:  
    - 1 VP per Location and Leader in play.  
    - VP tokens on Base, Locations, or Leaders.  
    - Redevelopment or Leader swap: +2 VP (1 for card, 1 for action).  
  - VPs are not cumulative; recount each turn.  
  - Move faction marker on VP track.  

- **Clean-up**:  
  - Discard all unused Resource, Worker, Contact, and Redevelopment tokens.  
  - Return faction tokens to players.  
  - **Exception**: Cards with "Keep" icon (e.g., Warehouse, Leader cards) retain Resource tokens.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Condition**: A player reaches ≥30 VPs during VP Count → game ends after current turn.  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - Locations: 1 VP each.  
  - Leaders: 1 VP each.  
  - Redeveloped Location: +2 VP (includes action bonus).  
  - Swapped Leader: +2 VP.  
  - VP tokens: on Base, Locations, Leaders.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Most cards in hand.  
  2. Most unused Resources and Workers.  
  3. If still tied, game ends in draw.  

**VP Limits**:  
- No card (except Base) can have more than 3 VP tokens.  
- Cards stop producing VPs once they reach 3 VP tokens.  

**Three Slot Rule**:  
- Max 3 Spoils and/or Deals can be tucked under any single card (Base or Location with trait).  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Hand Limit**: If at 10 cards and told to draw, draw and immediately discard.  
- **Redevelopment Tokens**: Can be used multiple times per turn; each allows one redevelopment without Building Material.  
- **Baby Swift**: Unique action; can be used repeatedly; no Worker needed.  
- **Spoils/Deals**: Can be discarded anytime to free space, but only produce resources/VPs if discarded during Production phase.  
- **Opponent’s Locations**: Cannot send Workers to a player who has passed.  
- **Universal Resource**: Only substitutes for basic resources; does not count as all card types.  
- **Card Type Matching**: For redevelopment, both cards must share at least one Card Type icon. Universal Resource icon only matches other Universal Resource cards.
