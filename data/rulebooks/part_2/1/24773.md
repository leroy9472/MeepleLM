## On the Underground — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The aim of *On the Underground* is to build the most successful underground rail network by connecting stations and efficiently serving passenger travel. Players earn points by building track lines, enclosing stations in loops, connecting to special stations, and having the Passenger use their lines. The player with the most points when the game ends wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board in the center.  
2. Place the Passenger pawn on Euston (Passenger start station).  
3. Randomly place one Connection token on each of the 8 green connection stations:  
   - Aldgate, Baker Street, Charing Cross, Elephant & Castle, Hammersmith, King's Cross St. Pancras, Notting Hill Gate, Victoria  
4. Shuffle all 55 destination cards and deal 4 face-up next to the board.  
5. Place the 4 Destination pawns on their matching stations.  
6. Form a draw pile from remaining cards; leave space for a discard pile.  
7. Each player takes:  
   - One score marker  
   - All track pieces corresponding to the colors shown on their score marker  
   - Number of colors per player:  
     - 2 players: 4 colors each  
     - 3 players: 3 colors each  
     - 4 or 5 players: 2 colors each  
8. Choose a start player and give them the Start player marker.  
9. Place score markers on the score track:  
   - Start player → position 0  
   - Next players clockwise → positions 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn proceeds in this order:

#### A. Build Track (up to 4 actions)  
- May place up to 4 track segments in any combination of your colored lines.  
- Rules for placement:  
  - A new line may start on any empty track space.  
  - Once a line has been started, all further segments must extend from one of its ends.  
  - Loops have no ends and cannot be extended unless branching.  
- **Branching**:  
  - To add a segment not at an end, pay 2 Branch tokens to the supply.  
  - This counts as one of your four track placements.  
  - You may branch using tokens collected earlier in the same turn.  

#### B. Move the Passenger  
- The Passenger visits up to two stations:  
  1. One **Express** station (if any face-up)  
  2. One **Normal** station (if any face-up)  
- Movement rules (applied in order):  
  1. **Least walking** (fewest unconnected track spaces walked)  
  2. **Fewest line changes** (fewest rail lines used)  
  3. **Tiebreaker**: Current player chooses  
- The Passenger may pass through other destination stations en route.  
- After reaching a destination:  
  - Replace destination pawn with Passenger pawn  
  - Discard the corresponding destination card  
- After both moves (or one, if only one type remains), draw new cards to refill 4 face-up.  
- Place new Destination pawns on the new stations.  

#### C. End of Turn  
- Refill destination cards and pawns.  
- Game may end during this phase (see End Game).  
- Next player takes their turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Earning Branch Tokens  
Players may gain Branch tokens in two ways (may be used same turn):  
- **Skip a track build**: Gain 1 Branch token per skipped placement (max 4 per turn)  
- **Connect a line to a Terminus station**: Gain 1 Branch token immediately (in addition to 2 points)  

#### Scoring Points (awarded immediately upon qualifying action)  
Each scoring condition applies **once per line**:

| Condition | Points | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Connect line to a **National Rail station** | 1 VP | Any player can score; no first-player advantage |
| Connect line to a **Terminus station** | 2 VP | Also gain 1 Branch token |
| Connect **two Connection stations with same symbol** with one line | 3 VP | Must be same line; symbol match only |
| Enclose **stations inside a loop** (not on the loop) | 1 VP per station | Scored when loop is completed; each station scored only once |
| Passenger uses your line during movement | 1 VP per line | Only one point per line per journey, regardless of length used |

> Note: Multiple lines can score for the same station/connection. Reconnecting the same station with the same line does not re-score.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Trigger  
When replacing destination cards and the draw pile is exhausted:  
- The active player immediately removes the Passenger from the board.  
- Play continues with players only building track (no more Passenger movement).  
- The game ends when the **next player to act is the start player**.  
  - The start player **does not** take a final turn.  
  - If the start player would be next immediately, the game ends now.  

#### Final Scoring  
- No additional scoring at end of game.  
- Player with the **most points** wins.  
- **Tie**: All tied players win.  
  - Optional tiebreakers (group may choose):  
    - Most Branch tokens  
    - Later in turn order

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

#### Track Building  
- **Can I use multiple lines in one turn?**  
  Yes. Up to 4 track segments may be from any combination of your lines.  
- **Can I branch using tokens collected this turn?**  
  Yes. Tokens gained by skipping builds or reaching a terminus can be spent immediately.  
- **Do I pay branch tokens when connecting a loop to itself?**  
  - Extending to complete a loop (e.g., end to end): **No**  
  - Extending from a point *inside* the loop afterward: **Yes**, counts as branching  
- **What stations score when enclosed?**  
  All station types: normal, express, national rail, connection, and termini.  

#### Passenger Movement  
- **Does the Passenger visit all four destination stations?**  
  No. One express (if available), then one normal (if available).  
- **Who chooses the destination and route?**  
  The Passenger chooses both station and route to minimize walking and line changes.  
  - First: minimize walking  
  - Second: minimize line changes  
  - Third: current player chooses among tied routes  
- **Can the Passenger travel through a destination to reach another?**  
  Yes. He may pass through unvisited destinations.  
- **What if only one type of station remains?**  
  Passenger visits only one station of the available type.  

#### General  
- **Discard pile visibility?**  
  Not specified. Groups may decide whether it is public or memory-based.  
- **Tie game?**  
  All tied players win. Optional tiebreakers may be used.  
- **Out of track pieces?**  
  If unable to build, you must skip building and instead collect Branch tokens (via skipped actions).
