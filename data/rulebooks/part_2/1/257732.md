## PAX TRANSHUMANTIY MINI — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
PAX TRANSHUMANTIY MINI is a streamlined abstract strategy game set in the broader Pax Transhumanity universe. Players build a network of idea cards to trigger cascading impacts and shape the dominant intellectual sphere. The goal is to achieve a positive score by aligning your cubes with the dominant sphere while minimizing penalties.

### 2. Components  
- 8 Idea Cards  
- 8 Cubes (player supply)  
- Reserve pool of cubes (shared, 8 total)  
- Rosetta Stone reference (defines impact types)

### 3. Setup  
1. Draw 8 idea cards.  
2. Arrange them in any configuration, following adjacency rules:  
   - Each card after the first must be adjacent to another.  
   - Short-edge adjacency: flush (only one card per short edge).  
   - Long-edge adjacency: offset (two cards may share a long edge).  
3. Cards may be placed:  
   - Right-side up  
   - Upside down  
   - Face down  
4. For each card placed face down, take 1 cube into your supply.  
5. Remaining cubes go to the reserve.  
6. No impacts are triggered during setup.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn:  
1. **Draw Phase**: Draw cards equal to the number of cubes in your supply.  
2. **Placement Phase**:  
   - Choose one card to place in an empty spot in your tableau.  
   - Discard all other drawn cards.  
3. **Trigger Phase**:  
   - For each card with **no cube on it** that now has **both sphere colors matched** by adjacent cards or a **surge icon pointing directly to it**, add a cube and resolve its impact (per Rosetta Stone).  
   - You **must** trigger all eligible cards.  
   - If multiple cards can be triggered, you choose the order.  
   - If a card has an “or” in its effect, you choose which option to resolve and mark it with the cube.  
   - **Abilities on cards are not used.**

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Adjacency Rules**:  
  - Short edges: flush (1:1)  
  - Long edges: offset (1:2)  
- **Cube Placement**:  
  - Only cards with no cube and fully matched sphere colors (via adjacent cards or surge) can receive a cube.  
- **Impact Resolution**:  
  - Use the Rosetta Stone to interpret impacts when placing a cube.  
  - Impacts resolved immediately unless specified otherwise.

#### Rosetta Stone (Impact Types)  
- **Company**: No immediate effect. Affects endgame scoring.  
- **Solution**: No immediate effect. Affects endgame scoring.  
- **Growth**: Add one cube from the reserve to your supply.  
- **Defusal Growth**: Place a cube from the reserve onto a card that already has a cube. Do not re-trigger impacts.  
- **Exoglobal Recession**: Return one cube from your tableau to your supply.  
- **Industry Disruption**: Move a card (with at least one matching color) to a free location in the tableau.  
- **Social Resilience**: Flip over a card in your tableau. It still occupies space but does not count toward dominant sphere determination.  
- **Wild Problem**: Draw a card and place it, resolving triggers and impacts as normal.  
- **Nuclear Exchange**: Destroy one card matching the impact color (remove from tableau).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End**: Triggered when you draw 0 cards at the start of a turn (i.e., your supply has 0 cubes).  
- **Dominant Sphere**:  
  - The color most frequently appearing on **uncubed** cards in the tableau.  
  - Equal counts cancel out.  
  - If no color is dominant, you lose the game.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - +1 point per **Company or Solution** in the dominant sphere that has a cube on it.  
  - +1 additional point for **either** all Companies **or** all Solutions (your choice) in the dominant sphere.  
  - –1 point per **Company or Solution** in **any other sphere** that has a cube on it.  
  - –1 point per **unused cube** (in supply or reserve).  
  - –1 point per card in the **longest horizontal or vertical sequence** in the tableau (regardless of cubes).  
- **Win Condition**: Score **positive points**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a card that doesn’t trigger anything?**  
  Yes. You may place any drawn card as long as it fits adjacency rules.  
- **What if I have no legal spot to place a card?**  
  You must still place one card. If no spot exists, the game state is invalid (avoid during setup).  
- **Do flipped cards count for dominant sphere?**  
  No. Flipped cards (via Social Resilience) do **not** count toward dominant sphere determination.  
- **Can I trigger a card more than once per turn?**  
  No. A card can only be triggered once per turn, when it gains its first cube.  
- **Do surge icons trigger impacts?**  
  Surge icons help **match** sphere colors for triggering cubes, but do not themselves trigger impacts unless a cube is placed.
