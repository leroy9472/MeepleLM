## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the wild rapids of the Niagara River, players take on the roles of fearless canoers racing to collect valuable gems along the riverbanks. The most precious gems lie closest to the waterfall, but venturing too close risks falling over the edge. Players must paddle strategically, avoid the waterfall, and return gems safely to land. The game ends when a player achieves one of the winning conditions with their collected gems.

**Winning Conditions:**  
A player wins by being the first to collect **in their play area (on land)** one of the following:  
- 5 different-colored gems (one of each color)  
- 4 gems of the same color  
- Any 7 gems (regardless of color)

Multiple players may win in the same round if they meet the conditions.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Form the platform:** Place the box top and bottom side-by-side (open sides down). Set the game board across them so the river flows over the edge, creating a waterfall effect.  
2. **Place river discs:** Insert 9 transparent river discs into the riverbed, starting just below the rope. Leave the topmost spaces empty.  
3. **Place gems:** Put 7 gems of each color in their matching discovery place along the riverbank.  
4. **Place cloud marker:** Set the cloud on space **0** of the weather track.  
5. **Distribute player materials:** Each player takes:  
   - 2 canoes and 7 paddle cards of one color  
   - Places their canoes on either or both beaches near the docks (starting area)  
   - Selects a pair of adjacent spaces on the board: one round (for life preserver) and one rectangular (for card play)  
6. **Choose starting player:** Randomly select a starting player. They take the life preserver and place it on their round space.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of **four phases**, played in order:

#### Phase I: Play a Paddle Card  
- All players simultaneously choose **one** paddle card from their hand and place it **face down** on their rectangular space.  
- Players must use only cards they have not yet played this cycle.  
- After 7 rounds, all players retrieve their used cards and reshuffle their hands.

#### Phase II: Reveal and Take Action  
Starting with the player holding the life preserver, players reveal their cards clockwise and take one of two actions:

**A. Move Canoe(s) – if a number card (1–6) is played**  
- The number on the card is the **total movement points** available.  
- Movement rules depend on canoe location:  
  - **Both canoes on land:** Must move **one** canoe into the river. Cannot move both.  
  - **One canoe in water:** Must move the canoe in the water; may optionally move the one on land.  
  - **Both canoes in water:** Must move **both** canoes. Each moves the **full number** of points shown on the card.

**Movement Rules:**  
- Each river space moved = 1 point.  
- Canoes may move **upstream or downstream**, but **not both directions in one turn**.  
- Direction choice is free when moving downstream past the fork (left or right branch).  
- Canoes may not change direction mid-move.

**Loading/Unloading Gems (costs 2 paddle points each):**  
- Only **empty canoes** can load gems.  
- Canoes hold **only one gem**.  
- To load or unload, the canoe must be adjacent to a discovery place with gems.  
- Actions may occur:  
  - **Before moving** (then move 2 points less)  
  - **After moving** (move full points, then spend 2 to load/unload)  
  - **But not both before and after**  
- **Unloading a gem returns it to a discovery place.**  
  - A gem **cannot be unloaded into its matching-color deposit**.  
- **Reloading immediately after unloading is allowed only if:**  
  - The new gem is **different color**  
  - Done at the **same discovery place**  
  - Costs **4 paddle points total** (2 to unload + 2 to load)  
- **Cannot load/unload with a 1-card** (insufficient points).

**Stealing Gems:**  
- Only an **empty canoe** that ends its movement **upstream** on a space with an opponent’s **loaded canoe** may steal.  
- Costs **0 paddle points**.  
- May steal **one gem per empty hold** (i.e., one per canoe).  
- **Cannot steal if:**  
  - The canoe moved **downstream**  
  - The canoe just **unloaded a gem this turn**  
  - The canoe is **loaded**  
  - The canoe belongs to the same player  
- Multiple canoes may be on the same space.

**Landing (Bringing Gems to Land):**  
- Move a canoe **upstream past the rope** (docking area).  
- May **exceed required movement**—extra points are lost.  
- Unload any gem: place it in your **play area (safe zone)**.  
- Place the canoe on the beach.  
- Landing uses **0 paddle points**.

**Return Fallen Canoes (Optional, during Phase II):**  
- If a player has **lost a canoe over the waterfall**, they may retrieve it **during their turn** by:  
  - Returning **one gem** from their play area to its matching deposit.  
- If a player has **no canoes and no gems**, they may retrieve **one canoe for free** and place it on the beach.

**B. Influence Weather – if cloud card is played**  
- Player **must move the cloud marker** one space **up or down** on the weather track (cannot stay in place).  
- **Cannot move canoes**, collect, steal, or unload gems this turn.  
- Cannot return fallen canoes during this action.

#### Phase III: Move the River  
- The river moves **a number of spaces equal to:**  
  **Lowest number card played** + **Cloud position on weather track**  
  - Example: lowest card = 2, cloud at +1 → river moves 3 spaces  
- If **no number cards** were played:  
  - River moves only if weather is **+1 or +2** (moves that many spaces)  
  - If weather is **0 or -1**, river **does not move**

**How to Move the River:**  
- For each movement point:  
  1. Insert a new river disc at the top of the river (above the rope)  
  2. Push it slowly downstream, displacing all discs  
  3. When a disc goes over the waterfall, the movement is complete for that point  
- Discs usually alternate left/right at the fork, but not strictly  
- If a disc jams, push it gently in the **opposite direction of the previous disc**

**Canoes & River Movement:**  
- All canoes **float with the disc they are on**.  
- Must stay on the same disc during movement.  
- If a disc (and canoe) goes over the waterfall:  
  - **Canoes are lost** (placed at bottom of waterfall)  
  - **Gems in canoes are returned** to their matching deposit  
- Players may not move canoes during river phase.

#### Phase IV: Pass the Life Preserver  
- The current starting player gives the life preserver to the player on their **left**.  
- That player places it on their **round space** and becomes the starting player next round.  
- Next round begins with Phase I.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Simultaneous planning, turn-based execution:** Players choose actions secretly, then resolve in turn order.  
- **Risk vs. reward:** High-value gems are near the waterfall, but river movement can sweep canoes over.  
- **Resource management:** Paddle points are limited; loading/unloading costs movement.  
- **Weather control:** Cloud card allows indirect influence over river speed.  
- **River dynamics:** River movement is determined by lowest number played, modified by weather.  
- **Canoes are reusable:** Lost canoes can be retrieved by sacrificing a gem (or free if no canoes/gems).  
- **Multiple win conditions:** Encourages varied strategies.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Scoring:** Gems are only counted when **delivered to land** (in player’s play area).  
- **Game ends immediately after Phase II** if any player meets **one** of the following:  
  - Has **5 different-colored gems**  
  - Has **4 of the same color**  
  - Has **7 gems total**  
- All players who meet a winning condition **win** (multiplayer win possible).  
- Game does **not** continue to end of round.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can I move only one canoe if both are in the water?**  
A: No. If both canoes are in the water, you **must move both**, each the full number of points.

**Q: Can I change direction during a move?**  
A: No. A canoe must move **entirely upstream or downstream** in a single turn.

**Q: Can I steal a gem if I unload a gem earlier in the same turn?**  
A: No. A canoe that unloads a gem **cannot steal** in the same turn.

**Q: Can I move a canoe past the rope and then move it back into the river?**  
A: No. Once a canoe lands, it stays on the beach until your next turn. It can only re-enter during your next action phase.

**Q: What happens if all players play cloud cards?**  
A: River moves only if weather is **+1 or +2** (moves that many spaces). If weather is 0 or -1, river **does not move**.

**Q: Can I play the cloud card just to retrieve a canoe?**  
A: No. Playing the cloud card means you **cannot move canoes or retrieve fallen canoes** (unless you have no canoes and no gems — then free return is mandatory).

**Q: Can two canoes occupy the same river space?**  
A: Yes. Any number of canoes can be on the same space.

**Q: Do I have to use all paddle points when moving?**  
A: Yes, **unless** the move ends with **landing at the dock**. Extra points are lost in that case.
