# The Russian Campaign – Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
The Russian Campaign is a strategic simulation of the war between the Axis (Germany and its allies) and the Soviet Union from June 1941 to May 1945. Players take control of either the German or Russian forces, aiming to achieve victory through military conquest, political collapse, or superior territorial control.

**Victory Conditions:**
- **Decisive Victory:** Achieved immediately by:
  - Eliminating the enemy leader (Hitler or Stalin) and occupying the enemy capital (Berlin or Moscow).
  - Controlling every city on the map, plus Belgrade and Budapest.
  - For the German player: triggering a collapse of the Russian war effort.
  - For the Russian player: triggering a collapse of the Third Reich.
- **Lesser Victory:** If no decisive victory is achieved, victory is determined by accumulated victory points. A differential of 6–11 is a tactical victory, 12–17 a marginal victory, 18+ a substantive victory. A differential of 5 or less is a draw.

## 2. Components
- **Map Board:** Hex grid (approx. 32 miles per hex) covering the Eastern Front, with terrain including mountains, woods, swamps, rivers, cities, rail lines, and oil fields.
- **Counters (Units):**
  - **Unit Types:** Infantry, artillery, armor, cavalry, paratroopers, mountain, mechanized infantry, headquarters, leaders (Hitler, Stalin), fortresses, workers, partisans.
  - **Unit Sizes:** Corps (XXX), Army (XXXX), Army Group (XXXXX).
  - **Nationalities:** German (field grey), German SS (black), Russian (brown), Russian Guards (light brown), and Axis-Allied (olive: Finland, Hungary, Rumania, Italy).
- **Markers:** Turn, Year, Impulse, Weather, Railhead, Stuka, Maskirovka, Partisan.
- **Charts & Tables:** Movement Allowance Chart, Terrain Effects Chart, Combat Results Table (CRT), Weather Table, Time Record Chart.
- **Other:** Two six-sided dice, player aid cards, setup display.

## 3. Setup
1. **Bid for Sides:** Players secretly bid victory points from the German perspective. The player with the higher bid takes the German side. Negative bids give the Russian player additional victory points.
2. **Place Map:** German player at west edge, Russian player at east edge.
3. **Place Units:**
   - **Russian Player First:** Places all "At Start" units in their correct Military District (Western, Baltic, Kiev, Odessa) or specified city. Units not tied to a city can be placed freely within the district. Fortresses go in Leningrad and Sevastopol.
   - **German Player Second:** Places "At Start" units in their Army Group area (North, Centre, South), Rumania, or Finland. Units cannot be adjacent to enemy units at setup.
4. **Place Markers:** Railhead markers start on the German side of the front. Place the Turn, Year, and Impulse markers on May/June 1941.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each Game Turn represents two months and follows this sequence:
1. **Weather:** German player rolls for weather in all three zones (North, Centre, South).
2. **German First Impulse:**
   - Take replacements (May/June only).
   - Move units (normal, rail, sea).
   - Place Stukas.
   - Conduct combat.
   - Remove partisans in EZOC or near SS units.
3. **German Second Impulse:**
   - Move non-adjacent units.
   - Conduct combat.
   - Check for isolation (units out of supply are eliminated).
4. **Russian First Impulse:**
   - Take replacements.
   - Move units.
   - Conduct paratroop drops (snow turns only).
   - Conduct combat.
5. **Russian Second Impulse:**
   - Move non-adjacent units.
   - Conduct combat.
   - Check for isolation.
   - Deploy partisans.
6. **End Turn:** Advance Turn marker. German player checks for Russian war effort collapse.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Movement:** Units move up to their Movement Factor (MF). MF is modified by weather, terrain, and unit type (per Movement Allowance Chart). Units stop in woods, mountains, and swamps unless exempt (e.g., infantry in woods).
- **Zones of Control (ZOC):** Each unit exerts a ZOC in its hex and all six adjacent hexes. Units must stop upon entering an enemy ZOC and must attack adjacent enemies in combat phase.
- **Stacking:** Max two armies or three corps per hex. Army group HQs, workers, fortresses, leaders, and artillery corps do not count against stacking limits (one HQ per hex).
- **Combat:** Mandatory when units are adjacent at the end of movement. Attacker totals combat factors; defender does the same. Odds are calculated and rounded down in favor of the defender. Attacker rolls on the CRT. Results include retreats, exchanges, eliminations, and surrenders.
- **Supply (Isolation):** Units must trace an 8-hex supply line to a friendly city or rail line. In snow, this is reduced to 4 hexes. Units out of supply at the end of the second impulse are eliminated.
- **Combat Supply:** German, Italian, Rumanian, and Hungarian units in Russia during snow turns have their combat factors halved if not within 1 or 2 hexes of a friendly city (depending on year).
- **Reinforcements:** Units enter as specified on the Time Record Chart. German replacements occur once per year (May/June). Russian replacements occur every turn, based on worker units.
- **Special Units:**
  - **Stukas:** German air support. One per attack, shifts odds right on CRT. Available only in clear weather, first impulse.
  - **Maskirovka:** Russian deception marker. Allows surprise deployment of reserves and shifts odds right on CRT. Available Nov/Dec 1942.
  - **Partisans:** Cut rail lines and block movement. Placed by Russian player, removed if in EZOC or near SS units.
  - **Workers:** Generate replacements, have combat value, cannot move.
  - **Leaders (Hitler, Stalin):** Have fortress-like defense in their capital. Can move by air transport.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Points:** Awarded annually (Mar/Apr) based on cities/oil wells controlled beyond the objective line. Moscow and Berlin count as three cities. Belgrade and Budapest count if Russian-controlled.
- **Leader Movement:** 2 victory points awarded to the enemy each time Hitler or Stalin is moved.
- **End of Game:** The game ends in May/June 1945. If no decisive victory, the player with the higher victory point total wins based on the differential.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a unit move through a friendly ZOC?** Yes, freely.
- **Can stacked units split for different attacks?** Yes, as long as all adjacent enemies are attacked.
- **Can a unit retreat through mountains?** Yes, retreating units ignore terrain movement costs.
- **What happens to a unit that cannot retreat?** It is eliminated.
- **Can a fortress attack?** No, it only defends.
- **Can a worker unit be replaced?** No, eliminated workers are permanently lost.
- **Do paratroopers exert a ZOC when dropped?** No, not in the impulse they are dropped.
- **Can Stukas be used in mud?** Yes, with reduced effect (two-column shift instead of three).
