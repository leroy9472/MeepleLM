## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Aliens: Another Glorious Day in the Corps*, players control a fireteam of Colonial Marines responding to a distress signal from a Weyland-Yutani facility overrun by Xenomorphs. The mission is to survive, complete objectives (such as rescuing personnel, retrieving intel, or escaping), and eliminate the alien threat. Victory is achieved by fulfilling mission-specific goals before all characters are Killed, Knocked Down, or Captured by aliens.  

### 2. Components  
- Character models (Heroes and Grunts)  
- Alien models and Swarm tokens  
- Blip tokens (representing hidden aliens)  
- Motion Tracker cards (Level 1 and 2)  
- Endurance Deck and Exhaust Pile  
- Aim Dials  
- Barricade tokens (light blue = 1, dark blue = 2)  
- Spawn Points and Tunnel markers  
- Computer tokens, Sentry Guns, Crate tokens, Eggs, Facehuggers  
- Event and Equipment cards  
- Alien and Marine dice  

### 3. Setup  
1. Assemble the map per mission instructions.  
2. Place starting characters in designated spaces (e.g., blue squares).  
3. Set up initial Blips, Eggs, Facehuggers, Sentry Guns, Crates, and Computer terminals as specified.  
4. Shuffle Blip tokens into a pool.  
5. Shuffle Motion Tracker cards: for High Security, place 5 Level 1 and 5 Level 2 cards on top of the deck.  
6. Each player draws Motion Tracker cards based on player count:  
   - 1 player: 2 cards  
   - 2–4 players: 3 cards each  
   - 5+ players: 4 cards each  
   Highest-ranking player draws first; if card count doesn’t evenly divide, highest rank (and left neighbor if needed) draws one more or fewer.  
7. Set Turn Dial to 1.  
8. Reset all Aim Dials to character’s Aim stat.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of three phases:  

#### Marine Phase  
1. **Reset Aim Dials**: All characters’ Aim Dials are reset to their base Aim number.  
2. **On Activation Abilities**: Resolve any "On Activation" abilities.  
3. **Equip Endurance Cards**: Players may equip, unequip, or equip other characters within 2 spaces.  
4. **Perform Up to Two Actions**: Each character may take two of:  
   - **Move**: Up to Speed. Stops if entering space adjacent to Alien or Blip.  
   - **Attack**: Target Aliens, Swarms, or Blips.  
   - **Barricade**: Attempt to Barricade/Unbarricade a door (requires adjacent space and Tech test unless using Arc Welder).  
   - **Aim**: Increase Aim Dial by +1 (per official rules; house rule allows +2).  
   - **Interact**: Use terminals, crates, or other mission objects.  
   - **Card Action**: Play a card with a Special Action.  
   - **Rest**: Draw and/or recycle cards.  
5. **End of Activation Abilities**: Resolve any "End of Activation" abilities (e.g., Newt may Exhaust 2 cards to move a character 2 spaces toward her).  
6. **Activate Grunts**: Hero Characters activate Grunts equal to their Rank (Rank 1: 1 Grunt, Rank 2: 2, Rank 3: 3). A Hero cannot activate a Grunt with higher rank.  
7. **Pass Activation Token**: Pass to left; after all players activate, highest Rank player activates remaining Grunts.  

#### Alien Phase  
1. **Activate Aliens**:  
   - **Move Aliens**: Speed 6. Move toward closest visible character, shortest path, avoiding obstacles (but not barricaded doors).  
   - **Defensive Fire**: Characters within 4 spaces of an Alien that starts its turn adjacent to them may Attack. Triggers when Alien starts turn next to a Character.  
   - **Aliens Attack**: Each Alien adjacent to a Character attacks. Character rolls Defense:  
     - Roll ≤ Defense: survives.  
     - Roll > Defense: Knocked Down, captured at start of next Alien Phase unless rescued.  
     - Roll ≤ Melee: Alien is killed.  
2. **Activate Blips**:  
   - **Move Blips**: Roll Alien Die per board; all Blips on that board move that speed. Path toward closest character, avoiding obstacles. Stops if: out of speed, adjacent to Character, or fails to break barricade.  
   - **Spotting Blips**: If in Line of Sight of a Character, flip Blip:  
     - 1 Alien: replace with model.  
     - >1: replace with Alien model + tokens = total. Shuffle Blip back into pool.  
     - New Aliens finish movement and attack if able.  
   - **Defensive Fire** and **Aliens Attack** as above.  
3. **Draw Motion Tracker Cards**:  
   - Draw number equal to round number, up to 4 (e.g., Round 1: 1 card, Round 4+: 4 cards).  
   - If deck runs out, reshuffle discard pile.  

#### Finish Phase  
1. Resolve any Finish Phase effects.  
2. Check Victory/Defeat:  
   - Marines win if mission objectives met.  
   - Aliens win if all Characters are Killed, Knocked Down, or Captured.  
3. Clean Up: Advance Turn Dial, begin next round.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Line of Sight (LoS)**: Blocked by walls, door posts, closed/barricaded doors, and Character spaces (except Knocked Down). Can pass through diagonal corner between wall and Character if adjacent.  
- **Barricades**:  
  - Aliens tear down on 5+ (was 4+).  
  - Light blue token = 1 barricade, dark blue = 2.  
  - Reinforced: Flip light to dark when barricading.  
  - Breaching: Flip dark to light or remove light; Alien stops after breaking.  
- **Full Auto**: After successful hit, Exhaust 1 card to make another attack. Repeat until miss or stop.  
- **Area Attacks** (Flamethrower, Grenade): Target a space; roll for each model/token in that and adjacent spaces. One Action, one Aim reduction, one card cost.  
- **Always Hits On**: Weapons like VP70 hit on roll ≤ Aim *or* ≤ specified number (e.g., 3), even if roll > Aim.  
- **Free Actions**: Do not count as an Action. Can be used once per activation. Examples: Pulse Rifle grenade, Shoulder Lamp.  
- **Knocked Down**: Skip all Actions. Stand Up automatically at start of Alien Phase if no adjacent Aliens. Still targeted and rolls Defense.  
- **No More Blips**: If pool empty, move all Blips 3 spaces per missing Blip.  
- **Sentry Guns**:  
  - Activate/Deactivate via Tech test at terminal or adjacent gun.  
  - Rotate manually or remotely.  
  - Attack: roll ≤ 7 kills entire stack in target space.  
- **Facehuggers**:  
  - At end of Alien Phase, if <2 on board and Characters on secure tile, roll 4+ to hatch per Egg.  
  - If on Character, roll 6 at start of activation: kill Character, spawn Alien.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory**: Complete mission objectives (e.g., retrieve crates, escape with survivors).  
- **Defeat**: All Characters Killed, Knocked Down, or Captured.  
- **Scoring (High Security)**: Escape with any survivors = win.  
- **Endurance Deck Depletion**: If both deck and exhaust pile are empty, all players lose immediately.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you move through Knocked Down characters?** Yes. They do not block movement or LoS.  
- **Does Defensive Fire trigger if Alien starts turn next to Character?** Yes.  
- **Can a Character move from one Alien’s melee zone into another’s?** Yes, but must stop upon entering.  
- **Can Grunts be activated by lower-rank Heroes?** No. Hero cannot activate Grunt of higher rank.  
- **Can you use Full Auto in Defensive Fire?** Yes, but only against the attacking Alien/Swarm.  
- **Do Sentry Guns block movement?** No. They are tokens, not models.  
- **Can you re-use a Free Action like Shoulder Lamp?** Yes, if trigger (e.g., card play) changes top of deck.  
- **What if Motion Tracker deck runs out?** Reshuffle discard pile.  
- **Can you fire through door posts?** No. They block LoS.
