## BABEL — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In ancient Mesopotamia, rival builders strive to construct towering temples across five territories. Using the skills of powerful tribes—Assyrians, Hittites, Medes, Sumerians, and Persians—players build, steal, destroy, and manipulate to achieve architectural supremacy.  

**Objective**: Be the first to meet one of the victory conditions based on total temple levels built.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the board between two players.  
2. Each player takes one level 1 temple card and places it face up next to their quarry (off-board temple column).  
3. Shuffle the remaining temple cards and place them face down on the quarry.  
4. Shuffle all tribe cards and deal:  
   - Starting player: 3 cards  
   - Opponent: 5 cards  
   (Note: Some versions use 5 for both; use 3/5 if following second edition.)  
5. Place the remaining tribe cards face down as a draw pile.  
6. Each player places their stone figure on their side of the quarry.  
7. Oldest player takes the first turn.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has **three phases**, performed in order:

#### Phase 1: Draw 3 Tribe Cards  
- Draw 3 tribe cards from the face-down deck.  
- If the deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.  
- Hand size is public: if you end your turn with 4 or more cards, announce the number.

#### Phase 2: Perform Actions (in any order and quantity, except migration)  
Available actions:

① **Travel**  
- Discard any tribe card from your hand.  
- Move your stone figure to the matching territory.  
- Both players' markers may occupy the same territory.

② **Settle**  
- Play a tribe card from your hand to the territory where your marker is located.  
- Cards are stacked overlapping, with tribe names visible.  
- Cards remain here unless moved by migration or a skill.

③ **Build (Temple Building)**  
- Take the **topmost** temple card from **either** player’s temple column.  
- Play it to the territory where your marker is.  
- Must build in ascending order (1 → 2 → 3…), unless using Persian ability.  
- The number of tribe cards in the territory must be **≥** the level of the temple card played (e.g., 4 tribe cards needed to build level 4).  
- This requirement includes any card discarded when using a tribe skill during the same turn.

④ **Migration (Once per turn only)**  
- Move the **topmost 3 tribe cards** from any one territory to another.  
- Cards must stay in the **same order**.  
- Destination may be empty or occupied.  
- May be done regardless of where your marker is.  
- Cannot migrate from a territory with fewer than 3 cards.

⑤ **Use Tribe Skill**  
- Requires **3 or more consecutive cards** of the same tribe in the **same territory** as your marker.  
- Discard **1 card** from the set to activate the skill.  
- Skill affects only the territory where your marker is.  
- If you have 4+ matching cards, you may use the skill multiple times per turn.  

**Tribe Abilities**:

- **Assyrians (Blue): Destroy Temple**  
  Destroy opponent’s entire temple in this territory. Return all its cards, **in order**, face down to the top of the temple supply (highest level first).

- **Hittites (Yellow): Steal Temple Level**  
  Take opponent’s **topmost** temple card from this territory and place it on your temple there.  
  Conditions:  
  - Stolen level must be **higher** than your current top level (skipping allowed).  
  - You must have enough tribe cards in the territory to support the new level (including the one discarded for the skill).

- **Medes (Green): Emigrate (Move Away)**  
  Choose one enemy tribe in this territory. Discard **all** of opponent’s cards of that tribe, regardless of position in stack.

- **Sumerians (Red): Switch Sides (Change Sides)**  
  Take all of opponent’s cards in this territory that match their **topmost (most recently played)** tribe card. Place them on top of your stack in the same order.

- **Persians (Grey): Jump a Level (Skip Level)**  
  Build a temple level **non-sequentially** (e.g., from 2 to 4).  
  Conditions:  
  - The desired temple card must be the **top card** of either player’s column.  
  - You must have enough tribe cards in the territory to support the new level (including the one discarded).

- **Any Tribe (Generic): Halve Enemy Hand**  
  Opponent must discard **half** their hand, rounded down (e.g., 7 cards → discard 3).  
  They choose which cards to discard. Discards are revealed one at a time.

#### Phase 3: Draw 2 Temple Cards  
- Draw 2 temple cards from the face-down supply.  
- Place them **on your temple column**, overlapping so level numbers are visible.  
- Place the **higher-level card first**, then the lower.  
- These cards become available for future building.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Turn Structure**: Strict three-phase turn (Draw → Actions → Draw Temples).  
- **Hand Visibility**: Public hand size when 4+ cards.  
- **Card Stacks**:  
  - Tribe cards: stacked at territories; top card indicates last played.  
  - Temple cards: stacked in player columns; only top card is playable.  
- **Migration**: Powerful for repositioning cards to enable skills.  
- **Tribe Skills**: Triggered by 3+ consecutive same-tribe cards; require marker presence and discard one card.  
- **Temple Building**: Normally sequential; Persians allow skipping. Level must be supported by tribe card count.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when **any** of the following occur:

1. **Primary Win**: A player reaches **15+ total temple levels** and opponent has **less than 10**.  
2. **End Phase Trigger**: A player reaches **15+**, but opponent has **10+** → game enters end phase.  
   - In end phase, game ends when:
     - A player reaches **20+ total temple levels**, OR  
     - Opponent falls to **less than 10 total levels**.  
3. **Deck Exhaustion**: The last temple card is drawn (even if not played).

**Final Scoring**:  
- Total the **topmost temple levels** in all territories for each player.  
- **Winner**: Player with higher total.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Player with more tribe cards in hand wins.

> Note: Temple levels are summed from **all built temples**, not just one column.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build on an empty temple space?**  
  Yes. First level must be 1. You may use Persian ability to skip to higher levels if conditions are met.

- **Can I use a tribe skill if my marker is not in the territory?**  
  No. Marker must be in the territory to use any skill there.

- **Does migration affect temple levels?**  
  No. Temples remain even if tribe card count drops below required level.

- **Can I steal a level with Hittites if I have no temple?**  
  Yes. Stealing places the level as your first temple.

- **What happens if I destroy a temple with Assyrians?**  
  All opponent’s temple cards in that territory go face down on the quarry, highest first. They must rebuild from scratch.

- **Can I use multiple tribe skills in one turn?**  
  Yes, if you have multiple sets of 3+ consecutive cards (e.g., 4 Sumerians = 2 uses). Each use requires discarding one card.

- **Can I migrate cards to a territory with no temple?**  
  Yes. Migration is independent of temple status.

- **Do I have to use all actions?**  
  No. You may perform any number of actions, including none.

- **Can I move and then use a skill in a different territory?**  
  Yes. Use Travel to move, then use skill in new territory if conditions are met.

- **What if both players tie in levels and hand size?**  
  Rules do not specify further tiebreakers. Assume re-roll or shared win if necessary.
