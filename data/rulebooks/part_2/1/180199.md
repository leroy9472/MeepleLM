### 1. Lore & Objective
In Colonial Twilight, players reenact the French-Algerian War (1954–1962), with one player representing the French government and the other the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN). The Government aims to maintain French control and legitimacy, while the FLN seeks independence by building political and military influence. Victory is determined by political support and strategic positioning.

### 2. Components
- Game board depicting Algeria and bordering countries (Morocco, Tunisia)
- Wooden pieces: blue (French Troops/Police), green (Algerian Troops/Police), black (FLN Guerrillas/Bases)
- Counters: cylinders (Resource and Commitment markers), pawns (action markers)
- Cards: 60 Event Cards, 6 Pivotal Event Cards, 5 Propaganda Cards
- Trackers: Edge Track (Resources, Commitment, Victory), France Track, Border Zone Track, Initiative Track
- Player aids: foldouts, non-player faction chart, capability markers

### 3. Setup
- Choose scenario (Full, Medium, Short) and follow specific setup instructions.
- Place markers on Edge Track: Commit, Support + Commitment, Opposition + Bases, France, and Initiative Track.
- Place Control markers and forces as directed by the scenario.
- Prepare decks: shuffle Event Cards, insert Propaganda Cards, and give Pivotal Event Cards to respective players.
- FLN starts as First Eligible in all scenarios.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. Reveal top card of deck.
2. First Eligible player chooses action: Event, Operation (with or without Special Activity), or Pass.
3. Second Eligible player responds with an adjacent option on Initiative Track.
4. Resolve actions in order, adjusting eligibility and resources.
5. Pivotal Events may preempt the current card if conditions are met.
6. After both players act, reveal next card unless it's a Propaganda Card.

**Propaganda Round (6 phases):**
1. Victory Phase (except first round)
2. Resources and Commitment Adjustment
3. Support Phase (Pacify/Agitate)
4. Redeploy Phase
5. Reset Phase
6. Prepare for next card

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Operations (Op):** Players conduct actions using resources.
  - *Government Ops:* Train, Garrison, Sweep, Assault
  - *FLN Ops:* Rally, March, Attack, Terror
- **Special Activities:** Accompany Ops; one per turn.
  - *Government:* Deploy, Troop Lift, Neutralize
  - *FLN:* Extort, Subvert, Ambush
- **Eligibility & Initiative Track:** Determines turn order and options.
  - First Eligible acts first; options depend on prior actions.
  - Performing Op in multiple spaces or with Special Activity makes player Second Eligible next turn.
- **Events:**
  - Dual-Use: Player chooses shaded or unshaded text.
  - Pivotal Events: Can be played at start of turn if conditions met (e.g., MOBILIZATION at Opposition + Bases ≥ 15).
  - Capabilities: Lasting effects (e.g., TALEB reduces Terror cost to 0).
  - Momentum: Effects last until next Propaganda Round.
- **Movement & Control:**
  - March moves Guerrillas; Underground status lost under certain conditions.
  - Control: More pieces than opponent in a space.
  - Bases: Max 2 per space; used for Rally, Train, and Victory.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Conditions (during Propaganda Rounds):**
  - Government wins if: Total Support + Commitment > 35
  - FLN wins if: Total Opposition + Bases > 30
- **Final Round:** If no victory, compare victory margins:
  - Government: (Support + Commitment) - 35
  - FLN: (Opposition + Bases) - 30
  - Higher margin wins; tie goes to FLN.
- **Propaganda Round Adjustments:**
  - Resources: Government gains Commitment + Available French pieces + Total Support (if RECALL DE GAULLE in play). FLN gains Bases + France Track bonus.
  - Commitment: Adjusted by moving French pieces between Out of Play and Available.
  - Redeploy: Government moves Troops to Cities/Bases, Police to Controlled areas. FLN moves Guerrillas within Wilayas (unless CROSS-WILAYA REDEPLOYMENT in effect).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Underground Guerrillas:** Activated when moving into Support with >3 total pieces (including Border Zone), or during Sweep/Garrison.
- **Extorting/Rallying with No Available Pieces:** FLN may take from other spaces in Algeria, but not from Morocco/Tunisia.
- **Pivotal Events:** MOBILIZATION unlocks Resettlement and allows FLN to play MOROCCO AND TUNISIA INDEPENDENT.
- **OAS Capability:** Can be used by either player in place of a Special Activity; places Terror, reduces Commitment and FLN Resources.
- **Passing:** Grants +1 Resource (FLN) or +2 (Government); both may Pass.
