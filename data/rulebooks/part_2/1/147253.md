   - Round 3: Reveal "Grow" action
   - Round 4: Begin using Empire B deck (replace Empire A)

   - Do **not** discard Military cards; refill face-up row to player count.
c. **Titan Decks**: If depleted, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.

#### Phase 2: Player Actions
Players take turns clockwise. On your turn, choose one action:

**a. Place Citizen**  
- Place one citizen on:
  - An empty action space, OR
  - A space where your citizen number is **higher** than all others present.
- Some actions have **special placement rules** (see below).
- Perform action immediately.

**Available Actions (Board Spaces)**:
- **Labor**: Gain 2 coins.
- **Build**: Buy one revealed Empire card or stored card. Pay cost. Must have available **capacity** (from Capital, Districts, Titans). Cannot own duplicate Empire cards. Special rule: May ignore "higher number" rule, but if your number doesn’t match any other present, pay 1 coin.
- **Draft**: Gain +1 attack value (swords/arrows) per citizen at this space. Lasts entire round.
- **Expand**: Pay 1 Knowledge **or** 3 coins. Take top District card (grants capacity and abilities). Flip next card face up.  
  *Variant (Expand+)*: Draw top 3 District cards, choose 1, return others to bottom.
- **Learn**: Pay 3 coins, gain 1 Knowledge.
- **Rebuild**: Repair up to 2 damaged Empire cards. Gain 1 coin. Take First Player Token (hand side up; cannot be taken this round). Special rule: No citizen number restrictions.
- **Recruit**: Buy one face-up Military card. Pay cost if any. Must have open army slot (initially 2). If full, **retire** an unused Military card: remove coins, flip to show Legacy abilities, place new card on top. Legacy abilities remain active. Special rule: May ignore "higher number" rule, but pay 1 coin if your number doesn’t match any present.
- **Explore**: Draw 5 Empire cards and **store** 1 face-down below your board, OR store 1 revealed Empire card. Stored cards can be built later. Discard unchosen cards. No storage limit.
- **Grow**: Pay 3 coins. Gain next-numbered citizen (#4, then #5). Place new citizen in **Starving box** (cannot act next round).

**b. Attack a Titan**
- Target: Top card of any Titan pile (1/2/3 stars).
- Requirements:
  - Use at least one **unused** Military card (no coins on name area).
  - Pay cost: number of coins already on card **+1**. Place new coins on **name area** (marks card as used).
- Total attack value must meet or exceed Titan’s defense.
  - Attack types: swords and/or arrows (match Titan’s symbols).
  - Sources: Paid Military cards, Empire/District cards with attack symbols.
- Success: Take Titan card, place to right of player board. Reveal next Titan.
- **Damage Roll**: Roll one die per **banner** on Titan.
  - **Titan symbol**: Damage one Empire card (flip face down). You choose which. If none available, ignore.
  - **Coin symbol**: Lose 1 coin per symbol. If insufficient, ignore.
  - **Blank**: No effect.
- Note: Damage effects may affect future actions (e.g., reduced food, army limit).

**c. Pass**
- End your turn permanently. Cannot act again this round.
- Round ends when all players pass.

#### Phase 3: End of Round
a. **Income**: Collect coins and knowledge from green-arrow symbols on owned cards.
b. **Military Reset**: Slide all coins from **name area** to **picture area** of Military cards (ready for next round).
c. **Reclaim Citizens**: Take back all citizen tokens to your board.
d. **First Player Token**: Flip to non-hand side (available to be taken).
e. **Feeding Check**:
   - Each citizen requires 1 food symbol.
   - Sources: Capital City (1), Empire cards, Districts, Titans.
   - Unfed citizens go to **Starving box** and cannot be used next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Capacity**: Determines how many Empire cards you can own. Starts at 4 (Capital City). Increased by District and Titan cards.
- **Army Limit**: Starts at 2. Increased by cards. Determines how many active Military cards you can have.
- **Stored Cards**: Empire cards acquired via Explore. Held face-down, no benefit until built via Build action.
- **Legacy Abilities**: Retired Military cards provide ongoing bonuses (shown on back and front top-right).
- **Damage & Repair**: Damaged Empire cards are flipped face down. Repair via Rebuild action or card effects. All repaired at endgame before scoring.
- **Citizen Numbers**: Govern placement priority. Higher numbers displace lower, unless special rules apply.
- **Turn Order**: Determined by First Player Token. Changes via Rebuild or card effects (e.g., Town Hall).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Trigger**: After completion of Round 6.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Repair All Damaged Cards**: Flip all damaged Empire cards face up.
  2. **Starvation Penalty**: Lose 2 VP per citizen in Starving box.
  3. **Banner Sets**: For each of the 5 colors, count tribe banners (from Empire, District, Titan cards). Score:
     - 1 banner: 1 VP  
     - 2: 2 VP  
     - 3: 4 VP  
     - 4: 6 VP  
     - 5: 8 VP  
     - 6+: 11 VP  
     *(Max 6 banners scored per color)*
  4. **Special Empire Cards**: Score bonus VP as described on card (e.g., "Citadel" gives +3 VP for 5 red banners).
- **Tiebreakers**:
  1. Most coins
  2. Most total cards (Empire + District + Titan)
  3. Most Knowledge tokens

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can I build a stored card even if it’s not in the row?** Yes, during Build action.
- **Can I repair a card damaged this round?** Yes, via Rebuild or card effects.

- **Can I use Empire card actions more than once?** No. Only one citizen per Empire card per round.
- **What if I can’t pay the coin penalty on Build/Recruit?** You cannot place your citizen there.
- **Can I use another player’s Empire card?** Only via Bridge or Trade City cards.
