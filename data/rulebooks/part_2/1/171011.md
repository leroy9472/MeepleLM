## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Favor of the Pharaoh*, players are petitioners in Ancient Egypt striving to rise through society to gain the Pharaoh’s favor. Starting as lowly herders, they collect influence through dice and special powers by claiming social-tier tiles. The game culminates in a final "roll-off" when any player claims the Queen tile. The winner is the player who ultimately wins the Pharaoh's favor during this final contest.

**Objective**: Be the player holding the Pharaoh token at the end of the Final Roll-Off.

### 3. Setup  

#### A. Level Bar Placement  
Place the five Level bars (3 through 7) in ascending order, A-side up for the first game. For later games, roll a die (odd = A, even = B) for each bar to determine side.

#### B. Tile Stacks  
For each Level bar, place tiles beneath it according to player count:

| Level | Tile Count per Stack (by # of Players) |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| 7     | 1 tile per stack                        |
| 6     | 2 fewer than players (min 1)            |
| 5     | 2 fewer than players (min 1)            |
| 4     | 1 fewer than players                    |
| 3     | Equal to number of players              |

Below Level 3, place **Herder** tiles equal to the number of players.

Unused tiles are returned to the box.

#### C. Special Placement  
- Place Pharaoh token on the **Queen** tile, which is always placed under the "7-of-a-kind" location.
- Place Scarab tokens face down in a pile; place +1 Die tokens next to them.
- Place all dice in a shared pool within reach.

#### D. Player Setup  
- Randomly choose first player. Give them the **Start Player** tile.
- Give each other player a **Start** tile.
- Starting clockwise from first player, second player draws 1 token, third draws 2, fourth draws 3 (from Scarab pile), and flips them face up.
- Each player receives a **Pyramid** to store locked dice during turns.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds clockwise. On a turn, a player performs the following steps:

1. **Roll Initial Dice**  
   Roll dice based on current tiles (minimum 3 Standard dice from Start tile).

2. **Reroll and Lock Dice**  
   - After each roll, **lock at least one active die** by setting it aside in your pyramid.
   - Active Immediate dice must be locked after rolling or entering play; cannot be rerolled.
   - Use tile powers and tokens between rolls to modify dice values, add dice, or reroll.
   - Repeat until all active dice are locked and no more dice will be added.

3. **Claim a Tile or Gain Tokens**  
   - If locked dice meet a tile’s requirement, claim one such tile (no duplicates).
   - If unable to claim (e.g., no valid tile), take **2 Scarab tokens** instead (only if you have a Herder tile).
   - Gaining tokens:  
     - Claiming a Blue tile → gain 1 token  
     - Claiming a Red tile → gain 2 tokens  
     - Some tiles grant additional tokens

4. **End Turn**  
   - Remove all dice from pyramid.
   - Straighten yellow/blue tiles (untap).
   - Flip used red tiles face down.
   - Next player’s turn begins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Dice Types  
- **Standard (Red)**: Default dice; numbered 1–6.  
- **Immediate (White)**: Must be locked immediately after being rolled or brought into play.  
- **Serf, Noble, Artisan, Intrigue, Voyage, Decree**: Custom dice with special effects when rolled (see Dice section).  

#### Tile Powers (by Color)  
- **Yellow (Populace)**: Add dice (start of turn or during turn).  
  - Must use dice-adding powers each turn if applicable.  
  - Used once per turn → turn sideways; reset at end of turn.  
- **Blue (Priesthood)**: Modify die values (add pips, move pips, adjust).  
  - Optional use; once per turn → turn sideways; reset at end.  
- **Red (Artifact)**: One-time per game abilities.  
  - Use once → flip face down.  
  - May be used during turn; some trigger after claiming.

#### Tokens (Scarab Tokens)  
Draw randomly from face-down pile. Use once per game, then discard. Two types:
- **Reroll token**: Reroll one active die.
- **+1 Pip token**: Add 1 to an active die (max 6).  
Multiple tokens may be used in sequence.

#### Claiming Rules  
- Only one tile per turn (unless power allows more).
- Cannot claim duplicate tiles.
- Requirements are shown on Level bars above tiles.
- Dice may be split (e.g., four 3s = two pairs).
- “All” conditions (e.g., All ≤2, All Even) apply to **all locked dice**.
  - Must meet minimum die count on Level bar.
  - Symbol faces count toward die count but not numeric value.
- **Herder tile**: Can be claimed with any roll (no requirement).

#### Dice Limits & Substitution  
If out of dice, substitute by rolling other types separately until enough are set aside.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Final Roll-Off Trigger  
When any player claims the **Queen** tile, the Final Roll-Off begins.

#### Final Roll-Off Procedure  
1. The player who claimed the Queen takes the **Pharaoh** token and announces a roll (e.g., “Seven 6s”), placing one die in the numbered slot under their pyramid showing that value.
2. Players who did not get a turn this round gain **1 Die token**.
3. Starting with the next player clockwise, each player attempts to:
   - Roll **more matching dice** than current Pharaoh, or
   - Roll **same number of matching dice** but with **higher value**.
4. During this phase:
   - No tiles are claimed.
   - Players may use their normal powers and tokens.
   - If a player succeeds, they take the Pharaoh and announce their roll.
   - Others must now beat the new roll.
   - If a player fails, they are **eliminated**.
   - If a player cannot possibly beat the current roll (due to insufficient dice), skip their turn; they cannot win.
5. If the Pharaoh changes hands, the **player with the Queen** gets a final turn (after all others) to reclaim it.
6. The player holding the Pharaoh at the end wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I reroll a die modified by a token?** Yes, unless it becomes an Immediate die or is locked.
- **Can I use multiple +1 Pip tokens on one die?** Yes, as long as total does not exceed 6.
- **Can I use a power that brings dice into play after my initial roll?** Yes, but not to add to the initial roll—only after a reroll.
- **What happens if Scarab tokens run out?** Reshuffle discarded tokens to form a new draw pile.
- **Can I use a red tile power after claiming the Queen?** Yes, if not already used.
- **Do symbol faces count for "All" conditions?** They count toward die count, but not for numeric comparisons.
- **Can I claim two tiles with a single roll using a power?** Only if a tile power explicitly allows it (e.g., "Claim up to two tiles").
- **Can I use a tile power that modifies starting dice during Final Roll-Off?** Yes.
