## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Evo is a strategic board game where players evolve dinosaur species over several rounds in a changing climate. The goal is to adapt your species through mutations, outmaneuver opponents, and maximize survival to earn mutation points (MP). The game ends abruptly when the meteorite token is revealed. The player with the most MP wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Board**: Use the island board side with twice as many white flared marks as players.  
2. **Player Pieces**: Each player takes 1 clan marker, 8 dinosaur tokens, and 1 player sheet.  
3. **Mutation Points**: Each player starts with 6 MP.  
4. **Climate Wheel**: Position arms so they frame the yellow (beach) zone in the innermost (ideal) circle.  
5. **Event Cards**: Shuffle and place face down.  
6. **Gene Tokens**:  
   - Place all 36 normal genes into the bag.  
   - Randomly add 8 of the 12 unique genes (red dot).  
7. **Climate Tokens**:  
   - Remove 1 random climate token from the game (do not look).  
   - Shuffle the meteorite token and 2 random climate tokens; place face down as a pile.  
   - Shuffle the remaining 9 climate tokens and place them face down on top of the 3.  
8. **Initiative Track**: Randomly place clan markers on the biology lab’s top row (initiative track). Leftmost is first.  
9. **Starting Dinosaurs**: Each player places 1 dinosaur on each of the 2 start spaces nearest them (or randomly assigned).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds through 6 phases:

1. **Climate Phase**  
2. **Mutation Phase**  
3. **Initiative Phase**  
4. **Movement Phase**  
5. **Birth Phase**  
6. **Survival Phase**  

After Survival, players gain MP and the next round begins. Game ends immediately if the meteorite token is revealed.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Climate Phase  
- Reveal the top climate token.  
  - If it is the **meteorite**, game ends immediately.  
  - Otherwise, rotate the climate wheel as indicated (clockwise/anticlockwise/0).  
- Climate zones (from hot to cold):  
  - Yellow (beaches) → Green (plains) → Brown (hills) → White (mountains)  
- Zones on wheel:  
  - Innermost (white): Ideal zone — all dinosaurs survive.  
  - Red ring: Hot zone — survival requires thermoregulation.  
  - Blue ring: Cold zone — survival requires fur.  
  - Black ring: Deadly zone — no survival unless cave dweller gene is used.  

#### Mutation Phase  
- Draw **(number of players – 1)** gene tokens from the bag.  
- Place them in the bottom row of the biology lab (starting from second column; first is for event card).  
- **No duplicates allowed**: If a duplicate appears, return it and draw a replacement until all are unique.  

##### Gene Auction  
- In **initiative order**, each player bids MP to acquire a gene or event card.  
- To bid: place clan marker on a number in the column of desired item.  
  - If column is unoccupied: bid any number (1–6).  
  - If occupied: new bid must be higher than current bid (max 6; cannot be outbid).  
- If a player is outbid:  
  - Immediately re-bid on a **different column**.  
  - May return to original column in later rounds.  
- Auction ends when all clan markers occupy different columns.  
- All players pay their bid in MP (minimum 0; alchemical vials reduce cost).  
- Winner of **first column** draws 1 event card. Others take their chosen gene.

##### Gene Effects  
**Normal Genes**:  
- **Legs**: Each pair = +1 movement point.  
- **Horns**: +1 to attack/defense in combat.  
- **Thermoregulation**: 1 dinosaur survives in hot (red) zone.  
- **Fur**: 1 dinosaur survives in cold (blue) zone.  
- **Eggs**: +1 birth action per round (after base birth).  
- **Alchemical Vial**: -1 MP cost for future gene/card purchases (stacks; cannot reduce below 0).

**Unique Genes**:  
- **Bony Plates**: +2 horns when defending (no effect when attacking).  
- **Large Horn**: +2 horns when attacking (no effect when defending).  
- **Thick Shell**: New dinosaurs may be placed up to 3 spaces away from existing ones.  
- **Flippers**: 1 dinosaur may move between coastal spaces (bordering sea) for 1 MP, once per Movement phase.  
- **Wings**: 1 dinosaur moves 2 spaces for 1 MP (ignores other dinosaurs), once per Movement phase.  
- **Regeneration**: Species cannot drop below 3 dinosaurs. At exactly 3: immune to attacks and climate effects.  
- **Killer Babies**: When placing new dinosaur adjacent to enemy-occupied space, roll die:  
  - On plain horn, horn+, horn=: enemy dies.  
  - Otherwise: baby dies.  
- **Sixth Sense**: Look at next climate token at any time.  
- **Cave Dweller**: 1 dinosaur survives in deadly (black) zone.  
- **Adrenaline Rush**: Choose any spot on initiative track during Initiative phase.  
- **Strong Thighs**: +2 movement points.  
- **Chameleon Skin**: Losing defender may move to adjacent space (not attacker’s origin). If no legal space, dies.

#### Initiative Phase  
- Move clan markers to the top row (initiative track) above the column they occupy on the biology lab.  
- Reorder markers by number of dinosaurs on the board: **fewer dinosaurs = earlier turn order**.  
- Ties retain previous order.

#### Movement Phase  
- In initiative order, players spend movement points (MP).  
- Total MP = 2 (base) + number of leg pairs across all dinosaurs.  
  - Each MP = 1 space moved by 1 dinosaur.  
- Dinosaurs cannot move through or end on occupied spaces (friend or foe).  
- To attack:  
  - Spend 1 MP to enter enemy-occupied space.  
  - Roll combat die:  
    - **Attacker wins** (plain horn, +, =): defender removed, attacker moves in.  
    - **Attacker loses**: both remain in place.  
  - A species with only 2 dinosaurs **cannot be attacked**.  
  - Multiple attacks allowed (each costs 1 MP).

#### Birth Phase  
- In initiative order:  
  - All players may place 1 new dinosaur adjacent to any of their dinosaurs.  
  - Players with 2 eggs repeat (place second baby).  
  - Players with 3 eggs repeat again, etc.  
- If a player has all 8 dinosaurs on board:  
  - May remove 1 to place a new one elsewhere.  

#### Survival Phase  
- In initiative order:  
  - **Ideal zone (white ring)**: all dinosaurs survive.  
  - **Deadly zone (black ring)**: all dinosaurs die unless cave dweller gene is used.  
  - **Hot zone (red ring)**: 1 dinosaur survives per thermoregulation layer.  
  - **Cold zone (blue ring)**: 1 dinosaur survives per fur layer.  
- Player chooses which dinosaurs to keep.  
- **No species reduced below 2 dinosaurs**, even in deadly zones.

#### Mutation Points  
- After Survival: each player gains **1 MP per dinosaur on the board**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends **immediately** when the meteorite token is revealed.  
- Final scoring:  
  1. **Most MP wins**.  
  2. **Tiebreaker**: most dinosaurs on the board.  
  3. **Still tied**: shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you play multiple event cards in one turn?**  
  Yes, as long as timing conditions are met. Cards are discarded after use.  
- **Can you pass on bidding?**  
  No. Every player must acquire either an event card or a gene.  
- **What happens if no legal space for chameleon skin?**  
  The defender dies.  
- **Can you attack your own species?**  
  No—only enemy dinosaurs.  
- **Can wings be used to move over sea?**  
  Yes—wings ignore terrain and other dinosaurs.  
- **Can flippers move between any coastal spaces?**  
  Yes, even non-adjacent ones, as long as both border sea.  
- **Is regeneration active at exactly 3 dinosaurs?**  
  Yes—immune to attacks and climate effects.  
- **Can you use killer babies on same space as normal birth?**  
  Yes—adjacent enemy space triggers roll.  
- **Can you use thick shell to place beyond 3 spaces?**  
  No—maximum 3 spaces from any existing dinosaur.  
- **What if all columns are occupied during rebidding?**  
  Players continue rebidding; outbid players must switch columns until all are on unique ones.
