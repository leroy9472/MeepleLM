  - Return all role cards to the pool.
  - Each player gains 2 Marks.
  - Throne holder takes the Direction marker.
- New round begins.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Roles
Each role grants a special ability to the chooser and a shared action.

**Explorer**
- Action: Each player selects one face-up exploration tile and places it on an empty board space.
- Special Ability: Immediately claim the placed sector with an Empire token (if unoccupied by enemy ships). Place all leftover revealed tiles after selection.
- After placement, reveal 1 tile per player +1.
- When no tiles remain, flip Explorer to become a second Warlord.

**The Black Hole**
- When a player selects the Black Hole tile, swap it with the central Omega Sun tile.
- Remove the Scientist role from the game.

**Merchant**
- Special Ability: Gain 3 Marks.
- Set resource prices: Roll 4 dice, discard one, assign remaining to market (lowest → food, middle → metal, highest → energy).
- All players may:
  - Harvest food from controlled sectors.
  - Buy/sell resources at current prices.
  - Fund metal/energy production by placing food (max 2 per sector) on generating sectors. Excess food must be sold.

**Steward**
- Special Ability: Place 1 Metal or Energy (your choice) for free in your Storage Facility (within capacity).
- All players may produce Metal/Energy by spending 1 food per controlled generating sector. Resources go to Storage Facility (respect capacity). Discard excess.

**Engineer**
- Special Ability: Take 1 free fighter and deploy it to any of your Starbases.
- All players may build ships (Fighter: $1; Cruiser: $2 + 1 Energy; Dreadnought: $3 + 2 Energy). Pay with Marks and resources.
- Deploy newly built ships to any Starbase. No limit per sector. Cannot deploy to Empire-only sectors.
- Fleet limits: 8 Fighters, 4 Cruisers, 2 Dreadnoughts.

**Warlord**
- Movement:
  - Fighters & Cruisers: 2 spaces
  - Dreadnoughts: 1 space
  - Empires & Starbases: immobile
  - Skip Sun tiles when moving.
  - Claim unprotected planet sectors with an Empire token when moving in.
  - Stop and resolve combat upon entering enemy-occupied sector.
  - Cannot move into or attack enemy home sectors.
- **Black Hole Warp**: Ships ending Warlord in Black Hole may warp to any non-Home, non-Sun sector on next Warlord. Warping into combat grants one free attack (defender cannot return fire but chooses hits). No retreat allowed.
- Combat:
  - Special Ability: Gain +1 die for one ship per battle when attacking.
  - Phases (attacker chooses to continue or retreat after each):
    1. Dreadnoughts fire: 3 dice each
    2. Cruisers (2 dice), Empires (2 dice), Starbases (3 dice)
    3. Fighters fire: 1 die each
  - Resolve rolls simultaneously. Defender chooses which units are hit.
  - Casualties:
    - Fighters, Cruisers, Empires: destroyed by 1 hit
    - Dreadnoughts: flipped on first hit, destroyed on second; repair if survivor
    - Starbases: flipped to Empire on hit; do not repair
  - Attacker wins: claims sector with Empire token and gains 1 VP if enemy Empire destroyed.
  - Defender never scores for combat.

**Regent**
- Throne holder places Throne card next to board.
- 1. Gain Influence:
  - All players draw 2 Empire tokens as influence.
  - In turn order, each may buy 1 extra token. Cost starts at 2 Marks, increases by 1 per purchase.
- 2. Exert Influence:
  - In turn order (chooser goes last), players place influence on planet sectors or Throne.
  - Empire on board = 1 influence; Starbase = 2.
  - You may:
    - Upgrade own sector (Empire → Starbase)
    - Expand to uncontrolled planet sectors
    - Downgrade enemy Starbase → Empire or remove enemy Empire
  - Cannot influence home sectors.
- 3. Resolve Conflicts:
  - On contested sectors or Throne, remove influence evenly until one player remains.
  - If tied, sector/Throne is left empty.
- Claim Sectors:
  - 1 influence left → leave Empire token
  - 2+ influence → leave Starbase, return excess
  - If lose control of sector with ships, move them to nearest pre-existing Starbase.
- Claim the Throne:
  - If you have influence on Throne, take it.
  - If no one has influence, Throne goes to role chooser.
- Victory Count:
  - Score 1 VP per planet controlled (some sectors have 2 planets).

**Scientist**
- Action: Buy 1 Technology card.
- Special Ability: Pay 1 less Energy (cost can go to zero).
- Technologies are used once per role (unless "Anytime").
- After all players act, refill display.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends when:
- A player places their last Empire token, OR
- A player takes the last VP chit from the pool.

All players finish the current role. Then:
- If game ends during Warlord or Explorer: Final VP count:
  - 1 VP per planet controlled
  - 1 VP for each player with full Storage Facility
  - 2 VPs to player with most Marks (tie: each tied player gets 1 VP)
- If game ends during Regent: No final count (already scored).
- VPs are awarded even if VP chits are depleted.

**Victory**
- Player with most VPs wins.
- Tie: The two tied players with the most controlled sectors battle in a neutral sector with their full fleets to determine winner.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Black Hole Swap**: Triggers removal of Scientist role. Only happens when a player selects the tile.
- **Warlord Free Fighter**: Only if available in reserve.
- **Combat Retreat**: Only attacker can choose to retreat. Warping attackers cannot retreat.
- **Throne Ownership**: Required to start Regent. Gained via influence or default to role chooser.
- **Technology Use**: "Anytime" abilities can be used once per round, then flipped; unflipped at start of next turn.
- **Home Sector Immunity**: Cannot be attacked, moved into, or influenced.
- **Storage Facility**: Max 3 Energy, 6 Metal. Cannot exceed capacity.
