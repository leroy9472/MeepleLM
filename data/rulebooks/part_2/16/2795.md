## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Autoduelling Parks are high-octane, combat-based arenas where drivers engage in vehicular duels under specific environmental and structural conditions. Each arena features unique terrain, obstacles, and rules designed to challenge driver skill, vehicle design, and tactical decision-making. The primary objective varies by event but typically includes eliminating opponents, completing laps, or capturing objectives. Events are hosted globally and range from AADA-sanctioned competitions to unsanctioned, high-risk duels.

### 2. Components  
- **Vehicles**: Customized combat cars, cycles, trikes, or aquabikes.
- **Arenas**: Structurally distinct dueling grounds with hazards, obstacles, and special features.
- **Obstacles**: Spikes, walls, bunkers, ramps, snow, ice, water, debris, potholes, TV towers, medical facilities.
- **Weapons**: Turrets, dropped weapons (in some events), hand weapons, LMGs.
- **Support Systems**: Cranes (for arena access), metal shops, medical trauma centers (Gold Cross), VIP viewing areas.

### 3. Setup  
- Players select a vehicle type based on event requirements (e.g., Division 10 cars, gas vs. electric, aquabikes).
- Duelists place debris and potholes (if applicable) per arena rules, avoiding starting zones.
- Vehicles are positioned at starting gates or pads depending on arena layout.
- For non-standard access (e.g., Hallowell Dueling Towers), vehicles are lifted into the arena via cranes.
- Events may require specific equipment: tire chains (on ice), body armor (cycle events), gas tanks (gas events).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Event Start**: All vehicles begin simultaneously unless otherwise specified.
2. **Movement & Maneuvers**: Players declare movement, accounting for terrain modifiers (ice, snow, banked curves, oil, etc.).
3. **Hazard Checks**: Roll for control when performing maneuvers or encountering hazards (e.g., ice adds +D4).
4. **Combat**: Declare firing arcs, apply range and movement modifiers, resolve hits.
5. **Damage & Effects**: Apply damage to vehicle components; check for loss of control using Crash Tables.
6. **Event-Specific Objectives**: Complete laps, eliminate opponents, capture bunkers, survive falls, etc.
7. **End of Turn**: Resolve ongoing effects (e.g., spinouts, rolling, medical saves).

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Terrain & Surface Modifiers  
- **Ice**: +D4 to any maneuver or hazard.
- **Snow**: +D2 to any maneuver or hazard.
- **Water (1.5 ft deep)**: D2 hazard, deceleration of 15 mph/turn (minimum 5 mph), no maneuvers above D3 unmodified, tire shots blocked.
- **Oil/Gravel/Bad Road**: -1 to fire and maneuver.
- **Curved Bank (Waterville DuelParc)**: -D1 for inner track maneuvers, +D1 for outer edge.

#### Obstacle Rules  
- **Spikes**: Collision with last 1/4" causes 1.5× normal damage.
- **Walls**: Vary by arena (e.g., 30DP, 40DP, 100DP, or indestructible).
- **Ramps (Belgrade Lakes)**: 30° concrete ramps with packed snow; +D3 to cross; skids/fishtails go downhill; 15+ damage creates pothole.
- **Bunkers (Belgrade Lakes)**: 20DP walls, block all fire, heated pads clear of snow.
- **TV Towers (J. Carter Arena)**: Indestructible.
- **Center Tower (J. Carter Arena)**: 20’ tall, 30DP lexan windows; VIP seating; no liability for poor aim.

#### Vehicle & Combat Rules  
- **Tire Shots**: Prohibited at Mount Vernon Duel Park; intentional shots = disqualification.
- **Dropped Weapons**: Prohibited in racing events at Waterville DuelParc; allowed in arena duels.
- **Turrets**: Required at Spears Corner (due to center blocks); -2 to target vehicle body when firing across blocks.
- **Falling (Hallowell Dueling Towers)**: Arena is 40' above ground; vehicles going over edge fall; use falling rules for collision with ground.

#### Control & Crash Mechanics  
- **Crash Table 1**: Used for failed maneuvers.
  - Trivial skid (2 or less): skid 1/4", same orientation.
  - Spinout (9–10): rotate 90° per phase, decel 20 mph/turn, may attempt recovery at HC–6.
  - Roll (11–12): car turns sideways, rolls 1/4 per phase, takes damage per side contact.
  - Vault (15+): flies ld6", flips, lands with collision damage, continues rolling.
- **Crash Table 2**: For hazards.
  - Minor fishtail (1–4): rear corner shifts 1 square.
  - Major fishtail (5–8): rear corner shifts 2 squares.
  - Re-roll on Crash Table 1 if 9+.
- **Hazard Difficulty Modifiers**:
  - Ice: +D4
  - Oil: +D2
  - Deceleration: D1 (15 mph), D2 (20 mph), up to D11 (45 mph)
  - Losing tires: D2 (first), D3 (second), HC–6 (last tire on corner)

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Scoring varies by event:
- **Kills**: Standard point value; triple points for cars pushed over edge at Hallowell.
- **Laps**: Completed laps scored (e.g., Rome Corner’s "Double Circle").
- **Survival**: Last vehicle standing wins (e.g., J. Carter’s "Meat Grinding").
- **Objective Capture**: Hold enemy bunker (Belgrade’s "Winter Offensive").
- **Speed Bonuses**: 50 mph increments scored at Waterville.
- **Medical Saves (Spears Corner)**: Duelist who "dies" rolls 1D6; 4–6 = saved, fights again.

Game ends when:
- All opponents eliminated.
- Objective completed.
- Time limit reached (if applicable).
- Disqualification (e.g., tire shot at Mount Vernon).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I fire while spinning or rolling?**  
  No. Spinouts allow no fire during rotation. Rolling (Crash Table 1, 11+) prohibits firing entirely.

- **What happens if I go off the edge at Hallowell?**  
  Vehicle falls 40'. Resolve falling damage using standard falling rules (not detailed here but implied). Collision with ground causes damage based on speed and angle.

- **Are dropped weapons ever allowed at Waterville?**  
  Yes, but only during arena duels — strictly prohibited in racing events.

- **Can I repair metal armor cheaply anywhere?**  
  Only at South Leeds Dueling Arena: 10% discount on repairs for metal armor.

- **What if I lose all tires?**  
  Car continues to roll until stopped. Becomes undrivable if fewer than three corners have tires. Cycles are undrivable after a roll.

- **Can I win after being "killed" at Spears Corner?**  
  If saved by medics (roll 4–6 on 1D6), you survive and may compete in future events, but not the same one.

- **Are turrets the only viable weapon at Spears Corner?**  
  Effectively yes — center walls block most fire; only turrets can shoot over them.
