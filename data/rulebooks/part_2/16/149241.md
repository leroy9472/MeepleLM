   - The third battle is won (victory).  
   - All heroes are defeated (loss).  
   - Final battle starts but Doomrock area is not revealed (loss).

  - **Explore**: Spend 1 time and 1 secret. Draw event card (wilderness/town: wilderness deck; mountain/Doomrock: mountain deck).  
  - **Venture Forth**: Spend 1 time. Discard leftmost area. Reveal new area from deck. Place secrets. Move party. Suffer Peril. Draw event.  
- Perils:  
  - Triggered by Skull symbol. Draw event card of current area type. Apply Peril effect (e.g., damage, expose).  
- Event Cards:  
  - Text: Choose one of two options.  
  - Custom Loot!: Use custom Loot! table.  
  - Permanent: Stays in play, acts as extra location.

    1. Paying silver equal to current number of ability cards.  
    2. Drawing 3 ability cards, keeping 1.  
    3. Gaining 1 die.

- Stats & Tests:  
  - Stat = number of ability cards with that stat.  
  - TEST: Roll D6 + stat. Pass if ≥ difficulty.  
- Battle Sequence (per round):  
  1. **Roll Phase**: Roll dice. Re-roll up to twice. Assign dice to abilities.  
     - Roll 1 → gain 1 Shield (discard end of round).  
     - Roll 6 → gain 1 Heroism (discard end of round).  
  2. **Start of Round**: Resolve start-of-round effects.  
  3. **Initiative Phase**: Activate initiative-enabled abilities.  
  4. **Minion Activation**:  
     - Each undefeated hero activates 2 minions (starting with highest threat).  
     - If all minions activated, hero activates 1 "rampaging" minion.  
     - Draw AI card, resolve minion actions top to bottom.  
  5. **Boss Activation**: Draw AI card, resolve boss actions.  
  6. **Hero Actions**: Heroes activate abilities in any order.  
     - Remove dice → spend heroism → resolve effect.

- Damage Resolution:  
  1. Reveal all expose markers.  
  2. Add +1 damage per +1 expose.  
  3. Absorb with shields (1 shield = 1 damage prevented).

  5. Reduce HP by remaining damage.  
- Expose Markers:  
  - 4 types: Blank, +1 Damage, Push, Battle Cumulation.  
  - Consumed only during battle when character is attacked or takes damage.  
  - **Battle Cumulation**: Remove all blank and this marker from pool; flip other revealed markers face down.  
  - **Expose Explosion**: If no markers left, consume all expose markers from characters.  
- Hidden:  
  - Threat = 0. Not surrounded. May redirect activation to another hero once per round.  
  - Ends if attacked or end of round.  
- Enrage:  
  - Add/remove time markers to encounter card. Triggers escalating effects.
