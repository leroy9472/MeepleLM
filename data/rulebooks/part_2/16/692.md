# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
War erupts after the death of a powerful Lord, leaving his domain vulnerable. Factions rise, alliances shift, and ancient powers awaken. Victory is achieved through military dominance, control of sacred sites, or discovery of hidden treasures—depending on the scenario. The ultimate goal is to claim the throne or achieve scenario-specific objectives through conquest, strategy, and resource management.

## 2. Components
- Hexagonal map tiles (multiple, depending on player count)
- Wooden blocks representing military units (various types, strengths, and combat ratings)
- Gold Points (GP) or coins for recruitment and upgrades
- Dice (D6)
- Tokens for special items (Magic Wand, Fire Sword, Temples, Ruins markers, Lord’s Castle, etc.)
- Optional: markers for moon phases, neutral forces, and treasures

## 3. Setup
### General Setup Rules:
- **Map Assembly**:  
  - 2 players: 1 map  
  - 4 players: 2 maps joined  
  - 6 players: 3 maps joined  
  - 8 players: 4 maps joined  
- **Player Order**: Roll dice to determine turn order. First roller is 1P, last is LP.
- **Faction Assignment (Alliances scenario)**:  
  - Players are grouped into 2 factions with equal armies.  
  - Odd-numbered players may control 2 armies.  
  - Each manages only their own blocks.

### Scenario-Specific Setup:

#### **Alliances**
- **Recruitment**:  
  - 2 or 4 players: 8 blocks, 20 coins per player  
  - 6 or 8 players: 6 blocks, 12 coins per player  
- **Placement**:  
  - LP places all recruited blocks in a 1GP city, with overflow in adjacent hexes (minimizing territory).  
  - Others place in reverse initiative order.  
  - Each faction chooses cities on different maps.  
- **Special Placements (Roll 2D6, different results)**:  
  - **Lord’s Castle**: Neutral castle in free city (max strength). Defeating it grants 2 VP and 5 coins.  
  - **Magic Wand**: 2+ hexes from any army, non-city terrain. Carried by a block. Grants -1 spell cost, 2 VP while held.  
  - **Fire Sword**: 2+ hexes from any army, non-city terrain. Allows reroll of one failed die per combat round. Grants 1 VP while held.  
  - **Lord’s Forces**: Reroll one die; place neutral creature (A, B, or C strength) 2+ hexes from armies. Grants VP and coins when defeated.  
  - Placement order: Opposite faction of 1P first, then 1P’s faction.

#### **Plundering Allies**
- **Recruitment**:  
  - Each player chooses 2 armies (8 blocks each, including 1 Castle per army).  
  - 30 coins to build up to 4 blocks per army.  
  - Castles start with 2 steps.  
- **Setup**:  
  - Join 2–4 maps depending on player count.  
  - LP places first Temple marker (non-city hex), others follow in reverse order.  
  - 1P places first army in 1GP city; placement proceeds in initiative order.  
  - Second army placed in reverse order, in a different map.

#### **Ruins**
- **Recruitment**:  
  - Each player chooses 1 army (8 blocks, including 1 mage).  
  - 12 coins to build army; mage added with full steps (cost added to army if B+).  
- **Setup**:  
  - Join 2–4 maps.  
  - 6 hidden tokens (1–6) placed in reverse initiative order on non-city hexes.  
  - 1P places two random blocks of next player in a 1GP city.  
  - Remaining blocks placed in another 1GP city on a different map, in reverse order.

#### **Assault on the Borderland (2-player)**
- **Attacker**:  
  - Choose 12 blocks.  
  - Purchase 40 GP worth of units.  
  - All enter from top edge on turn 1.  
- **Defender**:  
  - Choose 12 blocks, including exactly one B4 Castle (Capital).  
  - Purchase 30 GP worth of units.  
  - All units must be placed on board, with at least one in each city.  
  - Capital consolidates GP from nearby cities (within 2 land, 3 road, 4 sea hexes).  
  - Reinforcements: +4 GP in Capital on turns 3 and 6.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Initiative Phase**: Roll 2D6. Highest total gains initiative.
2. **Move Phase**: Players move in initiative order. Non-flyers stop upon entering enemy-occupied hexes.
3. **Combat Phase**: Battles resolved in order of attacker (Player 1 first). Defender fires first in each combat round.
4. **Build Phase**: Simultaneous spending of GP to:
   - Recruit new blocks in owned cities.
   - Add steps to existing blocks (anywhere on board, if GP is available via transport).
   - Use off-map gold (from treasures, temples, or neutral forces) for recruitment or step upgrades.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Combat
- **Firing Order**: By combat rating (A+, A, B+, B, C, etc.). Defender fires first in each category.
- **Strength**: Number of dice rolled = block’s current steps.
- **Hits**: Roll ≤ combat number (e.g., A3 hits on 1–3).
- **Targeting**: Hits applied to strongest enemy block; owner chooses if tied.
- **Retreats**:  
  - No retreats in Round 1.  
  - From Round 2: blocks may retreat instead of firing.  
  - Attacker retreats via entry hexsides.  
  - Defender cannot retreat via attacker’s entry sides.  
  - Flyers may retreat up to full movement to friendly land hexes.
- **Pursuit**: After 3 combat rounds, attacker must retreat; defender fires once more.

### Movement & Terrain
- **Stacking Limits (per player)**:  
  - Clear: 4  
  - Desert/Forest: 3  
  - Swamp/Mountain: 2  
  - Sea/Lake: 4  
  - +1 if city present.
- **Hexside Limits (per player, per hexside)**:  
  - Clear: 2  
  - Desert/Forest/Swamp: 1  
  - Mountain/River: 1 (only for appropriate units)  
  - Sea: 2 (Aquatics only)  
  - Coastal: Ground limit + 1 Aquatic.
- **Roads**: +1 movement if entire move is along roads.
- **Flyers**: Ignore terrain, stacking, and hexside limits (except stacking in combat).
- **Aquatics**: Restricted to water; may attack across water hexsides.

### Special Rules
#### **Neutral Cities**
- Become neutral when abandoned.
- Do not generate GP in Build Phase.

#### **Power Items (Carried by Blocks)**
- **Magic Wand (Alliances & Ruins)**:  
  - Reduces spell cost by 1 step.  
  - Grants 2 VP while held.  
  - Transferred in same hex during movement.  
  - Lost if carrier is eliminated or retreats; victor may assign it.
- **Fire Sword (Alliances)**:  
  - Allows one reroll per combat round.  
  - Grants 1 VP while held.  
  - Same transfer rules as Wand.

#### **Lord’s Forces & Castle (Alliances)**
- Neutral units fight first attacker.
- Do not heal; removed when destroyed.
- Player may ally by entering after attacker; manages neutral blocks during combat.
- Gold from defeating them is off-map, usable for recruitment or step upgrades.

#### **Sacred Temples (Plundering Allies)**
- When occupied in Build Phase, roll 1D6:  
  - 1: reroll  
  - 2–6: gain that many coins (off-map use only).  
- **Final Temple**:  
  - Roll 1D6: 1=1 coin, 2–5=2 coins, 6=7 coins.  
  - Triggers endgame: 3 turns remain.

#### **Ruins (Ruins scenario)**
- When entered in Build Phase, flip token:  
  - 1: Ruins Collapse – all blocks lose 1 step.  
  - 2: Magic Trap – same as above; mages/clerics may save (mage: 1–2 on D6, cleric: 1).  
  - 3: Mage Deception – all mages/clerics lose 1 step; gain 1 coin.  
  - 4–5: Treasure – 12 coins (off-map).  
  - 6: Magic Wand – allows wizards to cast spells without spending steps.  
    - If discovered by non-mages, can carry and transfer.  
    - If wizard defeats wizard with Wand, takes it.  
    - If carrier eliminated and no wizard on winning side, Wand is lost.

#### **Loyal to Mage (Ruins)**
- If army’s mage is eliminated, all faction blocks are immediately removed.

#### **Loyal to Castle (Plundering Allies)**
- If Castle is destroyed, no more blocks can be built for that faction.
- Occupied cities no longer produce GP.
- Off-map gold may be transferred to allied faction.

#### **Moon Phases (Werebeasts)**
- Cycle: HALF → FULL → HALF → NEW → repeat.
- **Half Moon**: Normal.
- **Full Moon**: +1 Combat Strength (B1→B2).
- **New Moon**: -1 Combat Strength (B1→B0).
