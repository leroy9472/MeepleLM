# FAB: The Bulge — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
FAB: The Bulge simulates the Battle of the Bulge during World War II, where German forces attempt a breakthrough in the Ardennes while Allied forces resist and counterattack. The game captures command decisions, logistics, and combat dynamics of mobile armored warfare.

**Objective**: Control key objective areas and eliminate enemy large units to accumulate Victory Points (VPs). A player wins by achieving a Sudden Death Victory during the Victory Check Phase or by having the highest VP total at the end of the game.

### 2. Components
- Wooden blocks representing infantry and armor units
- Die-cut counters for assets (artillery, engineers, command staff, fuel, etc.), events, and garrisons
- Control, disordered, recovering, reserve, river assault, and exploitation markers
- Blown bridge, field works, and roadblock markers
- Selection cups (opaque containers)
- Status Boxes: Available, Used, and Eliminated Boxes for each player
- Turn Track and Victory Point (VP) Track
- Player Aid Cards with Combat Tables and movement rules

### 3. Setup
- Each player receives an opaque selection cup.
- Units are placed in pre-marked areas as specified by the scenario.
- Field works, river assault, and reserve markers are placed as indicated.
- German player places assets marked "S" in their Available Box.
- Strategic Reserve units (German orange, American light blue) are held until triggered by events.
- Task Forces are placed in supplied, uncontested, friendly-controlled areas.
- Reinforcing assets and events are placed into the selection cup.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each Game Turn consists of:
1. **Reinforcement Phase** (both players)
2. **First Player Turn** (German player):
   - Admin Phase
   - Operational Movement Phase
   - Strategic Movement Phase
   - Combat Phase
   - Reaction Phase
   - Breakthrough Movement Phase
   - Breakthrough Combat Phase
   - Supply Phase
3. **Second Player Turn** (Allied player) – same phases as above
4. **Victory Check Phase**
5. **Advance Game Turn Marker**

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Sequence of Play
- **Reinforcement Phase**:
  - Reusable Special Action: If unused last turn, move one asset from Used to Available Box; otherwise, return Special Action block to Available Box.
  - German player moves one regular artillery asset from Used to Eliminated Box (if available).
  - Move all assets from Used Box to selection cup.
  - Place reinforcing units in entry areas (see entry area rules).
  - Place reinforcing assets and events into selection cup.

- **Admin Phase** (both players):
  - Draw assets/events from selection cup per Turn Track.
  - Phasing Player may:
    - Play events
    - Use engineer assets for engineering functions
    - Use Command Staff for Staff Functions
    - Use Special Actions
  - Non-phasing Player may do the same.

- **Operational Movement Phase**:
  - Units may move, hold position, build field works, or be placed in reserve.
  - Movement costs:
    - Road: 1 MP
    - Field: 2 MP
    - Blown bridge: full MP
    - Entering contested area: +1 MP
    - Exiting contested area: +1 MP
  - Infantry: 3 MP; Armor: 6 MP
  - Units may always move at least one area.
  - German units pay +2 MP when leaving their army zone.
  - German units require a fuel asset to move >3 MP or strat-move.
  - British units restricted to northwest of Meuse River.
  - Schnee Eiffel boundary: infantry only, costs all MPs; armor cannot cross.

- **Strategic Movement Phase**:
  - Only units with reserve markers and in supply may move.
  - Move to any friendly-controlled, supplied area via connected roads/fields.
  - Cannot cross blown bridges or enter enemy-controlled/contested areas.
  - Germans: only 1 unit per turn may strat-move; requires fuel.

- **Combat Phase**:
  - Mandatory in newly contested areas; optional elsewhere at attacker’s discretion.
  - Combat sequence:
    1. Defender may use Special Action to reinforce or retreat.
    2. Attacker assigns assets (if in supply and trace supply path).
    3. Defender assigns assets (if can trace supply path).
    4. Both players designate point units (defender first).
    5. Reveal units if newly contested.
    6. Attacking artillery fires.
    7. Defending artillery fires.
    8. Defensive ground fire.
    9. Offensive ground fire.
    10. End of combat round.

- **Reaction Phase**:
  - Non-phasing player may move reserve units up to full MP.
  - May build field works instead of moving.
  - Cannot create newly contested areas.
  - Remove reserve marker after action.

- **Breakthrough Movement Phase**:
  - Phasing player may move:
    - Reserve units (full MP)
    - Exploitation-marked armor units (1 area only)
    - Armor units activated via Special Action (1 area only)
  - May create newly contested areas.
  - May build field works.

- **Breakthrough Combat Phase**:
  - Mandatory combat in newly contested areas from breakthrough.
  - Optional combat in existing contested areas via Special Action.

- **Supply Phase**:
  - Verify area control.
  - Trace supply paths:
    - German: any friendly-controlled entry area (X-Z)
    - Allied: any friendly-controlled entry area (A-Q)
    - Path through friendly-controlled areas only
    - Can trace out of enemy-controlled areas but not into/through them
    - Can cross blown bridge only if adjacent
    - Cannot pass through vacant area adjacent to enemy-controlled area with uncontested enemy units
  - Mark unsupplied units/areas.
  - Adjust disordered markers: disordered → recovering; recovering → good order (if supplied).
  - Phasing player makes morale checks for unsupplied units:
    - Turn 6–9: two checks per unit
    - Fail: good/recovering → disordered; disordered → step loss
    - Disordered veteran rolls 10 → eliminated
    - Disordered green rolls 8–10 → eliminated
  - Remove: field works in contested areas, roadblocks, defended roadblocks, river assault markers, exploitation markers, non-phasing player’s reserve markers.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Check Phase**:
  - Calculate VP difference.
  - Sudden Death Victory possible from Turn 4 if VP lead meets threshold on Turn Track.

- **Victory Points**:
  - **Objective Areas** (must be friendly-controlled and supplied):
    - German-controlled areas (black crosses): 1 VP each to Allied player
    - Allied-controlled edge areas (white stars): 1 VP each to German player
    - Yellow-star areas: 1 VP each to controlling player
  - **Eliminated Large Units**: Units with 3+ steps eliminated are worth 1 VP to opponent (placed on Eliminated Large Units Track).
    - Exception: American 1st and 4th Infantry Divisions may be "resurrected" via event, losing VP.

- **Scenario End Conditions**:
  - Tournament: Sudden Death or VP comparison at end of Turn 5
  - Campaign: Sudden Death or area control count at end of Turn 9

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

#### Hit Allocation
- **Against Attacker**:
  1. First hit: eliminate one battle asset OR apply step loss to point unit.
  2. Then choose:
     - Abort attack: ignore remaining hits; units become disordered; river assault units retreat across rivers; assets go to Used Box.
     - Apply additional step losses.
- **Against Defender**:
  1. First hit: remove field works (if present).
  2. One artillery hit may be absorbed by disordering all defending units (if any are in good order/recovering).
  3. One ground fire hit may be absorbed by retreating all units (if possible).
  4. Apply remaining hits as step losses.

#### Step-Loss Allocation
- First step loss must be applied to point unit (though battle assets may be eliminated before).
- Each unit and battle asset must take one step loss before any unit takes a second.
- After all units have one loss and all battle assets are eliminated, distribute remaining losses freely.
- Artillery assets cannot take step losses.

#### Exploitation Opportunities
- Triggered when:
  - Defender retreats via Special Action
  - All non-artillery defenders eliminated by artillery fire
  - All defenders eliminated by ground fire with ≥1 unabsorbed hit
- **Not triggered** by river assaults or Breakthrough Combat.
- Attacking armor units make morale check (SN 5, modified):
  - Success: gain exploitation marker
  - May decline to remain hidden

#### Retreat Rules
- Must move to adjoining, uncontested, friendly-controlled area.
- May cross blown bridges.
- Retreating units become disordered unless retreating via Special Action.
- If retreat causes overstacking, continue retreating.
- Units unable to retreat take step loss(es) instead.
- Assets do not retreat; surviving assets go to Used Box.
