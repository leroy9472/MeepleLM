## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
This is a variant of the board game *Rail Baron*, designed to eliminate the need for the payout chart by using a deck of 150 destination cards. The objective remains consistent with the original game: players act as railroad tycoons traveling across cities to complete destination runs and earn payouts, with the goal of being the first to reach $200,000 in cash. The variant enhances gameplay by streamlining destination selection and payout calculation through cards.

2. Components  
- 150 destination cards (some card sheets used twice, ten blank/unused cards on last sheet)  
- Standard *Rail Baron* board, money, dice (2d6), and railroad ownership rules  
- Optional: blank "reshuffle" cards to prevent card counting  

Each card features:  
- Name of a city  
- List of the seven regions in *Rail Baron*  
- One region marked with an arrow: the region containing the city  
- Six other regions with numbers used for payout calculation  
- A small number in the upper-left corner indicating how many copies of that card exist in the deck  

3. Setup  
- Shuffle the 150-card deck.  
- Deal 4 cards to each player.  
- If a player has 3 or more cards from the same region, they discard excess and redraw until this is resolved.  
- Each player selects a starting city from their 4 cards.  
- From the remaining 3 cards, the player chooses a destination city in a different region.  
- Initial player order is determined by secret bid from starting money.  
- Player money is public information.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. On a player’s turn:  
   a. Move using 2d6 (movement optional; extra pips may be ignored).  
   b. If destination is reached:  
      - Calculate payout using starting and destination city cards.  
      - Payout = sum of the numbers on each card corresponding to the opposing region (i.e., destination region on starting city card and starting region on destination city card).  
      - Collect earnings.  
   c. After payout:  
      - May purchase railroads (standard prices, except Pennsylvania RR and Union Pacific now cost $35,000 each).  
      - May continue moving (if using Express Train or Superchief).  
      - Must select a new destination if needed.  
2. To draw new destination:  
   - Use one of remaining hand cards (must be in different region).  
   - If no cards remain, draw 3 new cards.  
   - The card matching the current city is placed face-up as the new starting city.  
   - If the resulting hand (current city + 3 new) has 3+ cards from the same region, redraw the 3.  
   - Player may use the 3 new cards in any order, as long as runs are between different regions.  
3. All cards in hand must eventually be used. Players must plan route order to avoid illegal same-region runs later.  
4. Deck is reshuffled when empty. Optional: include reshuffle cards to obscure count.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Payout Calculation**:  
  - Overlap starting and destination cards so their region arrows point to each other.  
  - The number opposite the destination region on the starting city card, and the number opposite the starting region on the destination city card, are added.  
  - Example: Boston to Knoxville = 4 + 6 = $10,000.  

- **Train Upgrades**:  
  - **Express Train**: Costs $20,000. Allows movement of (2d6 + 1d6) or (1d6 + 2d6).  
  - **Superchief**: Costs additional $20,000 after purchasing Express Train. Allows (2d6 + 2d6).  
  - Movement is optional; unused dice pips may be ignored.  
  - No fee for moving on own track.  

- **Hand Management**:  
  - Players must use all cards in hand.  
  - Order of destinations is constrained by region: no run may start and end in the same region.  
  - Example: holding New York, Boston, and Miami while in Chicago forces a route order that avoids New York → Boston (same region).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Payouts are earned upon completing a destination run.  
- Game ends immediately when any player reaches **$200,000**.  
- There is **no race home**; the first to $200k wins.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What if I draw a hand with three cards from the same region?**  
  Redraw the three new cards until fewer than three are from the same region.  

- **Can I ignore movement even with a Superchief?**  
  Yes. Movement is never required. You may roll and ignore any or all dice.  

- **Do I have to use the cards in the order I draw them?**  
  No. You may choose the order of your three drawn destination cards, as long as each run is between different regions.  

- **Can I choose a destination in the same region as my current city?**  
  No. All destination runs must be to a city in a different region.  

- **What happens when the deck runs out?**  
  Reshuffle all discarded and used cards (except current starting city cards on table) to form a new deck.  

- **Are the typo cards (e.g., "RAIXL BARON") functional?**  
  No. These appear to be test or corrupted print cards with no game function. They are not part of the 150-card deck described in gameplay.
