### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each Game Round consists of three phases:  

#### Phase 1: Game Round Setup (Skip in Round 1)  
1. Advance Game Round marker; reset Action Round to 1  
2. Advance Story Track:  
   - Draw new Story card and place at front  
   - Shift existing cards; discard pushed-off card  
   - If discarded card matches a team in play, that team gains 1 VP  
3. Replace empty Headline spaces; place Threat tokens  
4. Assign tokens:  
   - **Archnemesis**: Given to player controlling the Nemesis of the team with most VPs. Tiebreaker: highest Henchmen rating  
   - **First Player**: Given to player with fewest VPs. Tiebreaker: fewest Team Power-Ups; then random  

#### Phase 2: Planning  
Players act simultaneously. Steps:  

**A. Power-Ups**  
- Discard 3 Story cards to purchase one Team Power-Up (may be done at any time in this phase)  

**B. Receive Plot Points (PP)**  
- Gather all non-wounded heroes:  
  - On Support spaces on board  
  - On any position of their reference cards (if not Wounded)  
- Receive 1 PP per available hero  
- Receive 1 bonus PP for every 5 VPs (rounded down)  
- Unspent PP may be kept  

**C. Assign Super Hero Status**  
- For heroes in districts:  
  - Pay PP equal to hero’s Level to keep Ready  
  - Otherwise, move to Recovery  
- For available heroes:  
  - Pay PP equal to Level to place on Ready position  
  - Pay 1 PP to place on Supporting position  
  - All others go to Recovery (no cost)  

**D. Heal**  
- Remove Wound token from all heroes in Recovery  

**E. Allies**  
- Pay 1 PP to play Ally Resource card  
- Max 3 Allies in play per team  
- May discard an Ally to make room  
- **Linked Ally** (has team symbol):  
  - PP spent to play it is placed on the card (can be used twice)  
- Optional: Place 1 additional PP on Ally when played (even if not linked)  
- Cannot add PP to Allies already in play  
- Allies are activated by discarding 1 PP from card or discarding card itself  

#### Phase 3: Mission Phase (5 Action Rounds)  
Players alternate actions starting with First Player. Each player takes 5 actions total.  

Available actions:  
- **Movement**  
- **Medical Treatment**  
- **Story**  
- **Use a Special Ability**  
- **Troubleshooting**  

##### Movement Action  
Choose one:  
A) Move a Ready hero:  
- From card to any district  
- Between districts  
- From district to Recovery  
- If moving to a district, may move one Supporting hero (from Supporting position) to a Support space in the same area for free  

B) Move a Supporting hero:  
- From card to Support space  
- Between Support spaces  
- From Support space to Supporting position  

##### Medical Treatment Action  
- Remove 1 Wound token from a hero in Recovery  

##### Story Action  
- Draw 1 Resource card  
- Then choose one:  
  - **Advance Story Track**: Draw Story card, shift others, discard pushed-off card. If it matches a team in play, that team gains 1 VP  
  - **Manipulate Story Track**: Move one of your team’s Story cards to the end; shift others to fill gap  

##### Use a Special Ability  
- Use a **Support (Action)** ability of a Supporting hero (on card or on board)  
- OR play an Event Resource card that says “Play as an action”  

##### Troubleshooting Action  
Attempt to resolve a Headline in a district with at least one of your Ready heroes.  

**Normal Headline Steps**:  
1. **Determine Trouble Level**:  
   - Roll dice = Threat number (from token)  
   - Add Hit (*) and Trouble (!) icons = Trouble Level  
   - Dice boosting: Re-roll dice with Boost (+) icons once (ignore + on re-roll)  
   - If any Ready or Supporting hero has matching Skill (Fight, Science, etc.), ignore boosting  

2. **Reduce Trouble**:  
   - Subtract highest Troubleshooting rating (Crime, Danger, Mystery) of Ready hero  
   - Supporting hero with “(Troubleshooting)” ability may reduce further  
   - If Trouble Level ≤ 0, skip to Resolution  

3. **Play Villains**:  
   - All other players draw 1 Villain card (2 in 2-player)  
   - Starting with Nemesis, clockwise: each may play a card  
   - First played card = **Lead Villain**  
     - Requirement: Trouble Level ≥ Trouble Level Requirement  
     - Cost: Reduce Trouble Level by Trouble Cost  
   - If no one plays, skip to Resolution  
   - **Most Wanted Villain**: Can be played as Lead Villain with 0 requirement (cost still paid)  

4. **Backup Effects & Agents**:  
   - Starting with Nemesis, players may play cards for gray-box effects  
   - Cost: Reduce Trouble Level by Trouble Cost  
   - Backup Effects aid Lead Villain; Agents hinder hero  

5. **Combat**:  
   - Hero Player controls heroes; Lead Villain controller controls villains  
   - Combat is one-on-one per sequence  
   - **Combat Sequence**:  
     1. Choose Powers: Each secretly picks one Combat Power (red/orange/yellow)  
     2. First Attack:  
        - Attacker (Initiative) rolls Attack dice  
        - Defender rolls Defend dice  
        - If attacker hits ≥ defender hits → 1 KO  
        - If defender KOs = KO value → defeated  
     3. Second Attack: Swap roles  
     4. Outwit Contest:  
        - Each rolls Outwit dice  
        - Higher hits → 1 KO  
        - Winner gains Initiative  
        - Tie: no KO, Initiative retained  
   - Repeat until one side defeated  
   - **Dice Boosting**:  
     - Ready hero gets boosting if teammate is in Support space in same area  
     - Lead Villain only gets boosting if granted by Scheming  
   - **Multi-Hero Districts**:  
     - Choose one hero per combat sequence  
     - Combat continues until all heroes or Lead Villain defeated  
     - If hero defeated, villain gains Initiative  
   - **Outcomes**:  
     - **Hero Wins**: Discard all KO tokens, discard Lead Villain and all cards  
     - **Villain Wins**: Defeated hero → Recovery with 1 Wound; discard Lead Villain unless Most Wanted  
       - Most Wanted: Place on Most Wanted space (Nemesis of defeated team chooses replacement if full)  

6. **Headline Resolution**:  
   - **Hero wins or no Lead Villain**: Take Headline card and VPs; remove Threat token; reset Trouble to 0  
   - **Villain wins**: Discard Headline; no VPs  

**Mastermind Headline (or Normal + Archnemesis)**:  
- Nemesis may:  
  - **Attempt Master Plan** (Prologue → Development → Conclusion, in order)  
  - **Take one Scheming Action**:  
    1. Increase Threat: Add Nemesis’s Threat rating (Crime/Danger/Mystery) to dice roll  
    2. Draw Extra Villain Cards: + number equal to highest Level of Ready heroes  
    3. Grant dice boosting to Lead Villain  
- If Hero wins combat:  
  - May **Challenge Mastermind Villain**  
    - KO tokens not discarded  
    - Combat vs. Mastermind (always gets boosting)  
    - Draw Henchmen number of Villain cards as free Backup Effects  
    - **Hero Wins**: May play one Team Power-Up; Master Plan fails  
    - **Mastermind Wins or No Challenge**: Master Plan succeeds; ability may be used  
- If multiple heroes, combat continues until all defeated or Lead Villain defeated  

**Special Headlines (from Scenario)**:  
- Treated like districts (no Support spaces)  
- Nemesis cannot attempt Master Plan, but may take Scheming Action if Archnemesis  
- Solving it ends game after current Action Round  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Victory Points**: Earned from Headlines, Story card discards, Scenario effects  
- **Plot Points**: Used to assign hero status, play Allies, purchase Power-Ups  
- **Dice Mechanics**:  
  - Hit (*): Contribute to Trouble Level and combat  
  - Trouble (!): Only for Trouble Level  
  - Boost (+): Re-roll once (add results) unless Skill negates  
  - Max 8 dice in one roll  
- **Combat**:  
  - One-on-one sequences  
  - Initiative alternates based on Outwit results  
  - Special abilities used after rolls; only one per roll/result  
  - Initiative player resolves ability first if tie  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends per Scenario (e.g., after X rounds, or when Scenario Headline is solved)  
- Player with most VPs wins  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Player who scored Scenario Headline  
  2. Player with most Team Power-Ups in play  
  3. (If still tied) Player with most Story cards in hand  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Both hero and Lead Villain KO’d in same step**: Hero scores Headline but is Wounded and moved to Recovery  
- **Agents and Ally ratings**: Agents reduce dice even if Ally replaces rating  
- **Discarded Story cards**: Removed from game (not reshuffled)  
- **Discard Villain card for ability**: Includes Agent cards  
- **Dice re-rolls**: Add to original result  
- **Outwit rolls**: Simultaneous  
- **Attack/Defend rolls**: Attacker rolls first  
- **Abilities affecting “this” combat sequence**: Must be used before Power selection  
- **Abilities used simultaneously**: Initiative player goes first
