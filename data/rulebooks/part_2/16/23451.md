5. Core Mechanics  
A. Play Technology Card  
- Requires empty planning slot (max 2)  
- Option 1: Play from hand  
- Option 2: Draw 2 cards from Deck 2 or 3 (≤ current Tech Level), play 1, return other to bottom of deck  
- Advanced: Trade or discard planning cards (see below)  

B. Assign Timer (Inactive → Active)  
- Timer must be inactive (not running or usable)  
- Assign to:  
  a. Planet: Raise Tech Level by ½ (two required for full level)  
  b. Unbuilt card in planning area: Build it  
  c. Built card: Use its ability  
  d. Spaceship: Move it (see movement rules)  

C. Perform Completed (Usable) Timer Action  
- Timer has finished (sand fully drained)  
- Execute action:  
  - Tech Level: Move white cylinder up ½ level  
  - Build Card: Move from planning area to tableau  
    - Must follow power rules:  
      - Power-requiring cards (e.g., Solar Satellite) must be built over powered nozzle  
      - Fusion Reactor → over Solar Satellite  
    - Unpowered cards (e.g., Metropolis, Megacity) must align bottom edge with mine cards; may extend left/right  
    - Orders may never be covered  
  - Use Card:  
    - Mine: Take shown cubes; place on ship (≤8) or depot (≤4) at same planet  
      - Multimine: 1 cube of any shown color  
      - Minekomplex: 2 cubes  
      - Fusionmine: 4 cubes shown  
    - Konverter: Exchange 1–2 cubes at planet (ship or depot) for any color  
  - Move Ship: Ship arrives at destination  
    - Empty ship: may move to any planet  
    - Loaded ship: only to adjacent planet (including neutrals)  
    - May dump cargo to become empty and travel freely  

D. Satisfy Demand  
- Deliver correct goods to planet where ship is located  
- Move goods from ship to stock  
- Advance:  
  - Deliverer: first number of points  
  - Receiver: second number (may be 0)  
- Cover demand with one of your cylinders to mark fulfilled  
- Advanced: On neutral planet → draw Gizzi card, place over fulfilled demand  

E. Trading  
- At same planet:  
  - Between ships (any players, with agreement)  
  - Between ship and depot (same or different players, with agreement)  
  - Goods may be exchanged or given

  - 30-minute timer expires, OR  
  - Any player places their last victory point cylinder  
- After end:  
  - Active timers may finish and be used  
  - Usable timers may be used  
- Scoring:  
  - Deliverer scores first number on fulfilled demand  
  - Receiver scores second number  
  - On neutral planets (advanced): only deliverer scores  
- Winning:  
  - Most victory points wins  
  - Tiebreaker 1: Most fulfilled demands (cylinders placed)  
  - Tiebreaker 2: Shared victory  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I leave mined goods uncollected?  
  A: Yes. Timer becomes usable; goods may be collected later when ship/depot available.  
- Q: Can I use a Converter without deciding which cubes to convert?  
  A: Yes. Decision made when using usable timer.  
- Q: Can I build a card I don’t want?  
  A: Yes. You may discard it after building (via timer) or leave in planning area.  
- Q: Can I look at more cards if both planning slots are full?  
  A: No. Must clear a slot first.  
- Q: Can power sources be shared?  
  A: Yes. A card needing 2 power may use 1 from each of two Generators.  
- Q: Can I overbuild a card?  
  A: Only if:  
    - Overbuilding card requires 2 power → can overbuild any powered card  
    - Overbuilding card requires 1 power → can only overbuild 1-power card  
    - Unpowered cards → never overbuildable  
- Q: Can I move my ship to any planet if empty?  
  A: Yes. One move to any planet, regardless of distance.  
- Q: Can I trade cards not in planning area?  
  A: No. Only planning area cards may be traded.  
- Q: Can I use Transportsonde to send goods to opponent’s ship?  
  A: No. Goods go only to your own ship.  
- Q: How to verify scoring?  
  A: Each player:  
    - Sum lower numbers of fulfilled demands at own planet  
    - Sum higher numbers of fulfilled demands at others’ planets with their cylinder
