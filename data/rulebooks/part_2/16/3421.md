## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Each player acts as a "coach" leading a team of 5 players: 1 goalie and 4 outfielders. The objective is to score more goals than the opponent within a 25-turn match (called "minutes"). The team with the most goals at the end wins.

2. Components  
- $12 \times 8$ grid game board (playing field is $10 \times 6$ with 1-square sidelines on each side)  
- 5 player pieces per team (1 goalie, 4 outfielders)  
- 1 ball  
- 1 six-sided die  
- Turn tracker (25-minute marker, optionally extended)

3. Setup  
- The yellow coach places all 5 players first.  
- Placement rules:  
  - Only one player per space.  
  - The goalie must start in one of the two spaces directly in front of their goal.  
  - At least one player must be placed in the center circle on the coach’s own side.  
  - At least one outfielder must be in the coach’s own half, and at least one in the opponent’s half.  
  - No player may start in the center circle on the opponent’s side.  
- After placement, both coaches roll the die.  
- The higher roller wins kick-off. In case of a tie, re-roll.  
- The winner moves the ball from their center-circle player a number of spaces equal to their die roll minus the opponent’s roll.  
- No goal may be scored during the kick-off turn.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- A full turn consists of both coaches taking one action each.  
- After both have played, advance the turn marker by one minute.  
- Each coach’s turn consists of:  
  1. Rolling the die.  
  2. Moving one player (orthogonally, no passing through players, no returning to start).  
  3. Optionally kicking the ball if the moved player reaches it.  
  4. Continuing ball movement via passes if the ball reaches own players.  
  5. Ending the turn after using all die pips (unless a goal is scored).

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Movement**:  
  - Move one player per turn.  
  - Movement is orthogonal only (up/down/left/right).  
  - Maximum distance equals die roll.  
  - Direction may change after each space moved.  
  - Cannot move through or onto occupied spaces.  
  - Cannot return to starting space.  
  - Movement allowed outside field lines.

- **Kicking the Ball**:  
  - A player must end their move on the ball’s space to kick it.  
  - Ball is moved a number of spaces equal to:  
    (unused die pips after reaching the ball) + 1  
  - Ball may be kicked in any direction (orthogonal or diagonal).  
  - Ball’s path may change direction once by 45° (e.g., straight to diagonal or vice versa).  
  - Ball cannot pass through opponent’s player spaces.

- **Passing**:  
  - If the ball lands on a space occupied by one of your players, it counts as a pass.  
  - You may continue moving the ball from that player using remaining kick distance.  
  - Each pass resets the count: movement continues from the number that brought the ball to the player.  
  - Players may touch the ball multiple times in one turn via passing chains.

- **Scoring**:  
  - A goal is scored only if the last space the ball occupies before crossing the end line is one of the two spaces directly in front of the goal.  
  - Goals may not be scored during the initial kick-off turn.

- **Restart after a Goal**:  
  - The team that was scored upon places their goalie in one of the two spaces in front of their goal.  
  - The ball is placed with the goalie.  
  - The goalie’s coach rolls the die.  
  - If a 1 is rolled, re-roll until a 2 or higher is obtained.  
  - The ball is then kicked normally (movement = die roll, +1 not applicable since no prior move).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The match lasts 25 turns (minutes).  
- If tied after 25 turns:  
  - Play continues for up to 10 additional sudden-death turns.  
  - No new kick-off; game continues from current state.  
  - First team to score wins immediately.  
  - If no goals in extra time:  
    - The coach who scored the last goal during the 25-minute game wins.  
    - If no goals were scored at all, the game ends in a draw (no winner).  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a player move diagonally?**  
  No. Movement is orthogonal only. The ball may be kicked diagonally.

- **Can the ball change direction more than once?**  
  No. The ball may change direction once per kick/pass, by 45° (e.g., straight → diagonal or diagonal → straight).

- **What happens if a player ends in front of the goal (non-goalie)?**  
  Only the goalie may legally end a move in the two spaces in front of their goal. If a non-goalie plays the ball from there, they must be shifted:  
  1. One space toward the opponent’s goal (if possible).  
  2. If not, one space toward the nearest sideline.  
  3. If still not possible, two spaces to the other sideline.  

- **Penalty area restriction:**  
  Only one of your outfielders may occupy your own penalty area (the two spaces in front of your goal) at any time.

- **Enclosure prevention (Anti Killjoy Rule):**  
  - You may not arrange your players such that they, together with fewer than three field boundaries, fully enclose the ball.  
  - Additionally, there must always be a path from at least one of your players to the ball without crossing field borders.  
  - This applies to both teams at all times.
