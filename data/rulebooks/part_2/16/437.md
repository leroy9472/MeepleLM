# Master Labyrinth - Optional House Rules Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In the depths of ancient catacombs beneath a ruined fortress lies the legendary labyrinth, where young wizards seek magical ingredients to complete their arcane formulas. While the core game challenges players to navigate shifting corridors and collect numbered tokens in sequence, these optional house rules add depth, variety, and personal strategy to the experience.

The objective remains: collect ingredients in numerical order (1–25), complete your secret formula, and earn the most points. These optional rules enhance replayability by introducing unique abilities, dynamic board changes, and strategic trade-offs.

### 2. Components (Required from Base Game)  
- 1 game board (frame)  
- 34 labyrinth tiles  
- 21 numbered ingredient tokens (plus 4 additional in some versions for 25 total)  
- 4 player pawns (wizards)  
- 12 magic wands (3 per player)  
- 21 secret formula cards (each listing 3–5 specific ingredient numbers)

### 3. Setup  
Choose any combination of the following optional rules before setup. Apply them in this order:

#### Base Setup (Mandatory)  
1. Assemble the board by placing 34 labyrinth tiles randomly within the frame, leaving one space empty.  
2. Each player chooses a pawn and places it on a starting corner tile of matching color.  
3. Shuffle the 21 ingredient tokens and place them face-down on random movable tiles (not on corners or the exit).  
4. Flip all tokens face-up.  
5. Shuffle secret formula cards and deal one to each player face-down. Return unused cards to the box.  
6. Give each player 3 magic wands.

#### Optional Rule Setup  
**01. Wizard Ability Deck**  
- Each player draws one card from the Wizard Ability Deck (or rolls 1d10) to determine their unique ability.  
- Place ability card face-up in front of you. It may be used once per game during your turn.  
- *Optional:* Spend 1 wand to use ability a second time.

**02. Ingredient Allergies**  
- Each player draws one card from the Ingredient Allergies Deck (or rolls 1d20).  
- If duplicate allergy, reroll.  
- If allergy matches an ingredient on your secret formula, redraw.  
- Record your allergy number. At scoring, that ingredient is worth (value – 10) points.

**03. Monster Guardians – Hungry Ooze**  
- Reveal one secret formula card and assign it to the ooze (visible to all).  
- Roll 1d4 to place the ooze in one of the four corner tiles.  
- Use a token (die, coin, etc.) to represent the ooze.  
- The ooze takes a turn after the last player each round.

**04. Heavy Secret Ingredients**  
- No setup needed. Effects apply during gameplay when collecting ingredients on your secret formula.

**05. Simpler Scoring**  
- Use this scoring system instead of standard scoring (see Scoring section).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in player order. If using the Hungry Ooze, it acts after the last player.

**On Your Turn:**  
1. **Optional – Take/Use Potions** *(if using Book of Potions expansion)*  
2. **Push the Labyrinth**  
   - Slide one row or column (12 possible directions marked on frame).  
   - Cannot push the same direction just used.  
   - Insert new tile from the edge; one tile is ejected.  
   - Any tokens or pawns on the ejected tile move with it and are placed on the new tile when reinserted.  
3. **Move Your Pawn**  
   - Move any distance along connected paths.  
   - May end on a tile with another pawn.  
   - Cannot stay in place unless you choose not to move.  
4. **Collect Ingredient (if applicable)**  
   - Only collect the next number in sequence (start at 1).  
   - If you land on it and it’s the correct number, take it.  
5. **Optional Actions**  
   - Use Wizard Ability (once per game, or twice with wand).  
   - Cast a Spell (spend ≥15 ingredient points to draw and use one random Wizard Ability this turn only).  
   - Trigger other effects (e.g., ooze movement, shifting ingredients).

**After All Players’ Turns:**  
- **Shifting Ingredients**: Roll 2d20. If both numbers are on the board, swap their positions. Stop after token 19 is taken.  
- **Hungry Ooze Turn**:  
  - Roll 1d4 and move one tile in that direction (if path allows).  
  - If lands on ingredient listed on its formula, remove it (eaten).  
  - If a player enters or passes through ooze tile, roll 1d6: on a 1, drop one ingredient of choice.  
  - *Optional Advanced Rule:* Rows/columns containing the ooze cannot be pushed.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Wizard Abilities (Examples)  
Each player has one unique ability (public). Use once per game unless paying a wand for reuse.  
Examples:  
- **Lodestone**: Pull any ingredient token up to two tiles toward you.  
- **Double Push**: Push two different rows/columns this turn.  
- **Jump**: Move your pawn directly to any tile with an ingredient.  
- **Skip Ahead**: Collect the next token *plus one* (e.g., take #6 when #5 is current). *Note: Considered potentially unbalanced.*  

#### Casting Spells  
- Spend ingredients totaling **15 or more points** (based on token numbers).  
- Return spent tokens to the box (no scoring).  
- Draw one **unused** Wizard Ability card and use it immediately (this turn only).  
- If unused, return card to deck at end of turn.  

#### Heavy Secret Ingredients  
- Collecting an ingredient on your secret formula slows you:  
  - 1st collected: max 10 tiles movement per turn.  
  - 2nd collected: max 7 tiles.  
  - 3rd (or final): max 5 tiles.  
- Applies for the rest of the game.  

#### Ingredient Allergies  
- One ingredient is “allergic” to you.  
- Worth (token value – 10) at scoring.  
  - E.g., token 1 → –9 points, token 20 → +10 points.  
- Can still pick it up, but penalized.  

#### Simpler Scoring  
- Each ingredient token: **1 point**  
- Each ingredient on your secret formula: **+2 extra points**  
- Allergy ingredient: **–1 point**  
- Unused wands: **3 points each**

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when **ingredient #25 (mistletoe)** is collected.

#### Standard Scoring:  
- Each collected ingredient: worth face value (e.g., #12 = 12 pts)  
- Each ingredient on your secret formula: **+20 bonus points**  
- Each unused wand: **+3 points**  

#### With Simpler Scoring (Optional):  
- Each ingredient: **1 point**  
- Each match with secret formula: **+2 points**  
- Allergy ingredient: **–1 point**  
- Wands: **3 points each**

#### With Ingredient Allergies:  
- Allergy ingredient = (face value – 10)  
- All other ingredients: normal value  
- Example: Allergic to #15 → worth 5 points

#### With Casting Spells:  
- Spent ingredients do **not** count toward score  
- No bonus for secret formula on spent ingredients  

**Winner**: Player with highest total score.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I use a wand to use my Wizard Ability twice?**  
A: Yes, if playing with that optional rule. Spend 1 wand to reuse your ability.

**Q: What happens if the ooze blocks a path?**  
A: Players may still move through the tile. Only the *optional advanced rule* restricts maze pushing.

**Q: Can two players have the same allergy?**  
A: No. Reroll duplicates to ensure unique allergies.

**Q: When does Shifting Ingredients stop?**  
A: After token #19 is collected. No more swaps.

**Q: Can I cast a spell and use my own ability on the same turn?**  
A: Yes. Casting a spell gives you a *temporary* ability to use once that turn.

**Q: Does Heavy Secret Ingredients affect spellcasting or abilities?**  
A: No. Only movement distance is reduced.

**Q: Can I drop an ingredient on the ooze tile?**  
A: Yes. It can be picked up later by any player.

**Q: Is mistletoe (#25) ever an allergy?**  
A: No. It is excluded to ensure all players compete for it.
