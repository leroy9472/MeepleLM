## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the land of the dwarves, the King is determined by beard length — and the bearded competition extends to card play! In *The Dwarf King*, players compete over seven hands to accumulate the highest total score. Each hand features a unique scoring goal dictated by a Quest tile, which may reward or penalize players based on the cards they take in tricks. The player with the most points after seven hands wins.

2. Components  
- 39 basic cards:  
  - Suits: Knight (Blue), Dwarf (Green), Goblin (Red)  
  - Ranks: A (Champion), K (King), Q (Queen), J (Jack), 10 through 2  
- 14 special cards:  
  - Three cards with value 1 (one in each suit)  
  - Six cards with value 11 (two in each suit: one per suit)  
  - Five suit-less magic cards (no suit or value)  
- 20 Quest tiles: Each tile provides two scoring rules; one is chosen per hand  
- Card draw pile  
- Quest tile draw pile  

3. Setup  
- Shuffle the 39 basic cards, 14 special cards, and 20 Quest tiles into separate piles.  
- Number of players determines setup:  
  - 3 players: Remove the 2 of Dwarves. Use 38 basic cards + 1 random special card. Each player receives 13 cards.  
  - 4 players: Use all 39 basic cards + 1 random special card. Each player receives 10 cards.  
  - 5 players: Use all 39 basic cards + 1 random special card. Each player receives 8 cards.  
- After each hand, the used Quest tile and special card are removed permanently.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Determine dealer:  
   - First hand: Owner of the game.  
   - Subsequent hands: Player who took the 5 of Dwarves in the previous hand.  
2. Dealer draws a special card, reveals it, explains its effect, and shuffles it into the deck.  
3. Dealer deals cards evenly to all players.  
4. Player holding the 5 of Knights reveals it and draws the top Quest tile.  
   - Reads both scoring options.  
   - Chooses one scoring rule for the hand and announces it.  
5. Player holding the 5 of Goblins reveals it and leads the first trick.  
6. Play proceeds trick by trick:  
   - Winner of each trick leads the next.  
   - Players must follow suit if able.  
   - No trumps.  
   - Highest card of the led suit wins the trick.  
7. After all cards are played, players score points based on the chosen Quest rule.  
8. Used Quest tile and special card are discarded.  
9. Repeat for seven hands.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Trick-taking:  
  - A trick consists of one card played by each player, starting with the leader.  
  - Suit must be followed if possible.  
  - No requirement to win the trick (i.e., no obligation to play a higher card).  
  - Player with highest card of the led suit takes the trick.  
- Special cards:  
  - Value 1 and 11 cards belong to a suit and are ranked accordingly.  
  - Magic cards have no suit or value when played or scoring; their effects depend on context and are resolved upon play.  
- Card ranking (highest to lowest):  
  A > K > Q > J > 11 > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 2 > 1  
  (Note: 11 and 1 are special card values; magic cards have no rank)  
- Quest tiles:  
  - Provide two scoring options; one is selected per hand.  
  - Scoring always applies to cards *taken in tricks*, not held in hand.  
- Magic cards:  
  - Do not contribute to scoring (no suit or value during scoring).  
  - Their in-play effects are determined by the special card description (not detailed here).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After the final trick, players tally points based on the active Quest rule.  
- Example: “Knights victory over Dwarves: +1 per Knight taken, -1 per Dwarf taken.”  
- Magic cards never score points.  
- Scores are cumulative across seven hands.  
- Winner: Player with highest total score after seven hands.  
- Tiebreaker: Play additional hands until one player leads alone.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- What if no one has the 5 of Dwarves?  
  - This cannot happen — the card is always in play (except in 3-player games, where the 2 of Dwarves is removed, but 5 remains).  
- Can the 5 of Knights or 5 of Goblins be used in tricks?  
  - Yes. Players must play them when required by suit, unless leading.  
- Do magic cards count toward suit requirements?  
  - No. Magic cards have no suit, so they cannot satisfy a requirement to follow suit.  
- Can a player lead with a magic card?  
  - Yes, if that player is leading a trick and chooses to do so.  
- What if a player forgets to follow suit?  
  - Standard etiquette: correct the error if caught immediately; otherwise, play stands (no formal penalty specified).  
- Can a player lead any card when holding the 5 of Goblins?  
  - Yes. Holding the 5 of Goblins only requires that the player leads the first trick; the card played need not be the 5 of Goblins.
