## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Three expeditions depart from Northern Europe (marked by the compass rose) to explore uncharted locations, cultures, animals, and landscapes. Each player participates in all three expeditions and attempts to guide them to fulfill personal and shared objectives to score victory points. The goal is to have the highest score at the end of the game.

2. **Components**  
- 1 game board (world map)  
- 80 Expedition cards (one per green-circle location)  
- 135 arrows in 3 colors (representing the 3 expeditions)  
- 40 Tickets  
- 24 player tokens in 6 colors (4 small + 1 large per player)  
- 4 double-sided player aids  

3. **Setup**  
- Place the board in the center. The compass rose is the starting point.  
- Green circles = Locations (each has a corresponding card).  
- Blue squares and red stars = Hubs (intermediate spots; no cards).  
- Dashed lines = Paths (routes for expeditions).  
- Shuffle the Expedition deck and deal:  
  - 12 cards per player (2–3 players)  
  - 9 cards per player (4–6 players)  
- Form a face-down deck with remaining cards. Reveal 6 face-up cards beside it—these are **common objectives**.  
  - During setup, each common objective must be at least 3 paths from the compass rose. Replace any that are not.  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 1 large token (color reminder)  
  - 4 small tokens  
  - 3 Tickets  
- Return unused tokens to the box.  
- Sort arrows by color and place beside the board with remaining Tickets.  
- First player: the one who most recently traveled abroad.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
- Play proceeds clockwise.  
- On your turn, perform one main action and optionally use up to 2 Tickets before or after.  
- The game ends when either:  
  - A player places their last Expedition card, or  
  - All arrows are placed.  
- Finish the current round so all players have equal turns.

5. **Core Mechanics**  

**Advancing Expeditions**  
- On your turn, advance **one** expedition by placing an arrow of its color.  
- If the expedition hasn’t started, place its first arrow from the compass rose to an adjacent spot.  
- If it has started, extend from the last arrow’s tip to a connected spot.  
- Arrows must follow the same color; no backtracking (arrow cannot reverse the immediately previous path).  
- Expeditions are independent—multiple colors may occupy the same path.  
- Once all arrows of a color are used, that expedition is complete and cannot be advanced further.

**Waypoints (Map Wrapping)**  
- Three red half-stars on the left and right edges connect across the map.  
- An expedition may continue from one edge to the other at the same vertical level.

**Expedition Arrival Effects**  
When an arrow reaches a spot:  
- **Location (green circle)**:  
  - If a player has this card in hand, they must immediately reveal it and place it face up in front of them.  
  - If the location has their token (key location), they collect it and place it on the card.  
  - **Note:** If a player misses the moment, they cannot claim it later.  
  - If it matches a **common objective**, the player who placed the arrow claims the card, then reveals a new one from the deck.  
    - Even if the new card shows a previously visited location, it is valid only when the expedition reaches it again.  

- **Blue Square (Hub)**: The player immediately places another arrow on any expedition. Apply the effect of the new spot it reaches.  
- **Red Star (Hub)**: The player collects 1 Ticket. This also applies when arriving at a Waypoint (red half-star).

**Using Tickets (up to 2 per turn)**  
Each ticket allows one of:  
- **Add an arrow**: Place an additional arrow on any expedition (same effect as blue square).  
- **Remove last arrow**: Remove the final arrow from any expedition.  
  - If this reveals a completed objective, the player may claim it immediately.  
  - If the new end is a blue or red hub, apply its effect (extra arrow or ticket).  
- **Swap a card**:  
  - Draw 2 cards from the deck.  
  - Choose 1 to keep; return 1 to the bottom of the deck along with 1 card from your hand.  
  - You may discard a key location card—token remains on the map.  
  - You may discard both drawn cards instead of one from hand.

**Loop Rule**  
- If placing an arrow causes the expedition to return to a spot it has already visited (forming a loop), immediately place a new arrow from **any** spot the expedition has previously visited.  
- This new arrow becomes the base for future extensions.  
- A loop is confirmed if there is no "free arrowhead" (an arrow pointing to a new, unvisited spot).  
- Special case:  
  - If the loop ends at a **blue square**, place **two** additional arrows:  
    1. From any visited spot (due to loop)  
    2. On any expedition (due to blue square effect)  
- There is no limit to how many loops can be triggered per turn.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
The game ends when:  
- A player places their last objective card, or  
- All arrows are on the board.  
Finish the round so all players have equal turns (pass if no action possible).  

Scoring:  
- +1 point per completed objective (card in front of you)  
- +1 point per collected token (key location visited)  
- –1 point per Expedition card still in hand  
- –1 point per token of your color still on the map  

Winning:  
- Highest score wins.  
- Tiebreaker: most Tickets.  
- If still tied, players share victory.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can multiple players have the same objective?**  
  No—only one card per location, so only one player can have a given destination.  

- **Can I use a ticket to remove an arrow that causes a loop?**  
  Yes. If removing the last arrow causes the expedition to now end at a previously visited spot (i.e., no free arrowhead), it forms a loop—place a new arrow from any visited spot.  

- **What if a common objective is revealed that’s already been visited?**  
  It remains unclaimable until an expedition reaches that location again.  

- **Can I use tickets on other players’ turns?**  
  No—only on your own turn, before or after your main action.  

- **Can I place a token on a location less than 3 paths from start?**  
  No. Key locations must be at least 3 paths from the compass rose. Cards with the ⊙ symbol are ineligible for key locations and cannot be common objectives during setup.  

- **Can I start an expedition in any direction?**  
  Yes, but each of the three expeditions must begin in a different direction from the compass rose (implied by independence and path rules).  

- **What happens when an expedition reaches a hub via a ticket-used arrow?**  
  The hub effect still applies (e.g., arriving at a blue square via ticket grants another arrow).  

- **Can I use both tickets for the same action?**  
  Yes—e.g., spend 2 tickets to add 2 arrows, or remove 2 arrows, or mix actions.
