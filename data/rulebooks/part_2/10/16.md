## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
**Objective**: Be the player with the most Dirham in hand at the end of the game. Shops owned do not count toward victory — only cash.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with fountain spaces and shop locations  
- 24 shop signs (6 each of 4 types: Ali, Anfa, Omar, Leila)  
- 24 plastic shop stands  
- 48 visitors (14 yellow, 10 each of red, green, blue, and gray/GE)  
- Auction stone  
- Money: Dirham (standard) or New Dirham (1 ND = 25 Dirham)  
- 4 player game sequence cards  
- (Optional) 25 souvenir cards (5 per color) for Souvenir Variant  

### 3. Setup  
- Punch out and assemble shop signs onto stands.  
- Each player receives:  
  - One game sequence card  
  - 1,200 Dirham (or 48 New Dirham)  
  - Six shop signs of one color (Ali, Anfa, Omar, or Leila)  
- Place 3 visitors (no two of the same color) on each of the three dark blue entrance fountains.  
- Arrange remaining 45 visitors in a U-shaped queue outside the city walls.  
  - No more than 3 visitors of the same color may be adjacent.  
  - Queue has only two ends; new visitors must be taken from either end.  
- Choose starting player; play proceeds clockwise.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
**First Round (Auction Only)**  
- Each player, in turn, acts as auctioneer:  
  - Selects any unowned shop and places auction stone on it.  
  - Must make the first bid (minimum 100 Dirham).  
  - Other players may bid higher or pass, proceeding clockwise.  
  - Bidding continues until all but one player has passed.  
  - Winner pays bid to the bank and places their shop sign on the space.  
  - **Auctioneer’s Cut**: If the auctioneer does **not** win, they receive a commission based on the winning bid (amount not specified in source; assumed per profit chart logic).  
- After all players have auctioned once, first round ends.  

**Second and Subsequent Rounds**  
On your turn, choose **one** of the following three options. Actions must be performed **in order**:  

**Option A – Move & Move**  
1. Move all visitors from one fountain to an adjacent fountain.  
2. Repeat step 1 (move any group again).  

**Option B – Move & Auction**  
1. Move all visitors from one fountain to an adjacent fountain.  
2. Auction any unowned shop (as in first round).  

**Option C – Auction & Auction**  
1. Auction any unowned shop.  
2. Auction another unowned shop.  

**Critical Rule**: You **may never Auction and then Move**.  
- Auctioning first is only allowed if you do two auctions (Option C).  
- You cannot auction and then move in any other combination.  

**End of Turn Check – New Visitors**  
- If any of the three dark blue entrance fountains is empty at the end of your turn:  
  - You **must** bring new visitors into the city.  
  - Choose 2, 3, or 4 **consecutive** visitors from **one end** of the queue.  
  - Place them as a group on **one** empty entrance fountain.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Moving Visitors  
- All visitors in a group must move together to the same adjacent fountain.  
- Groups merge when arriving at an occupied fountain.  
- Visitors **cannot leave** the city once inside.  
- Dark blue fountains are treated like regular fountains after entry.  

#### Shop Entry  
- When a visitor passes an **owned** shop of their **own color**, they enter via the first door passed.  
- Once entered, the visitor becomes a permanent customer.  
- **Unowned shops**: Visitors pass by with no effect.  

#### Profit Calculation  
Profits are earned by the **shop owner** when a new customer enters. The amount depends on:  
- Number of patrons **already in** the shop  
- Number of **new patrons moved in**  

Use the **Profit/Cut Table**:

| Patrons Moved In ↓ \ Already Present → | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4+ |
|----------------------------------------|----|----|----|----|-----|
| **1**                                  | 5/5 | 15/5 | 25/5 | 30/10 | 40/10 |
| **2**                                  | 20/10 | 30/20 | 50/20 | 70/20 | 80/20 |
| **3**                                  | 30/30 | 60/30 | 90/30 | 110/30 | 120/30 |
| **4**                                  | 60/40 | 100/40 | 130/40 | 150/40 | 160/40 |
| **U (5+)**                             | 100/50 | 140/50 | 170/50 | 190/50 | 200/50 |

- **Left number**: Profit to **shop owner**  
- **Right number**: **Guide’s cut** (paid to the player who moved the group)  

- The **cut** is based on the **total profit** generated from **all new customers** entering **another player’s shop** during the move.  
- No cut is paid when visitors enter the **moving player’s own shop**.  
- Cut is paid **by the shop owner** out of their profit.  

#### Special Case: Immediate Entry After Auction  
- If a shop is auctioned and there is a group of visitors at a fountain adjacent to one of its doors:  
  - All visitors in that group matching the shop’s color **immediately enter** the shop.  
  - Owner receives full profit.  
  - **No guide’s cut** is awarded, even if the visitors were previously moved by another player.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game ends** when no visitors remain in the queue outside the city.  
- The **last round** begins: each player gets **one final turn**, ending with the player who brought in the **last group** of visitors.  
- After final turn, players count **cash on hand**.  
- **Shops do not count** toward score.  
- **Winner**: Player with the most Dirham.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move a group into a fountain with an unowned shop?**  
  Yes. Visitors pass unowned shops unless they match and the shop is owned.  

- **What if I move a group past multiple owned shops of the same color?**  
  Only the first shop of matching color is entered.  

- **Do I get a cut if I move visitors into multiple shops owned by the same player?**  
  Yes. Total profit from all shops is summed; cut is based on total.  

- **Can I split a group of visitors?**  
  No. All visitors at a fountain must move together.  

- **Can I bring in new visitors even if I didn’t move?**  
  Yes. Any time an entrance fountain is empty at the end of your turn, you must refill it.  

- **What happens if the souvenir cards are exhausted?**  
  Once all are sold, no more souvenir profits are possible.
