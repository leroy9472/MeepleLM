## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players compete to earn Victory Points (VPs) by gaining the favor of gods and half-gods, constructing monuments (columns), and leveraging nation-specific abilities. The game spans six epochs, with scoring at the end of the third and sixth epochs. The player with the most VPs at the end of the sixth epoch wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most half-god tiles wins; if still tied, the victory is shared.
