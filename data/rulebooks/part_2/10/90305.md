## Cargo Noir — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Cargo Noir is a game of smuggling, bidding, and strategic cargo trading in the shadowy world of 1950s international black markets. Players take on the role of crime syndicate leaders vying to profit from illicit goods by acquiring valuable cargo sets and converting them into Victory Point (VP) cards. The player with the most VP at the end of the game wins.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with ports (adjusted for player count)  
- Plastic coins (money)  
- Cargo tiles (including wild cargo)  
- Player boards (implied by "family card")  
- Ships (3 per player, matching player color)  
- Victory Point (VP) cards (purchased with cargo)  
- Cargo draw bag  

### 3. Setup  
- Adjust board for player count: certain ports are deactivated ("dead") based on number of players (as indicated on board).  
- Place one set of cargo at each active port.  
- Add a number of **Wild cargo tiles** equal to the number of players into the cargo draw bag.  
- Each player receives:  
  - 3 ships  
  - $7 in plastic coins  
  - A family card (player identifier)  
- Determine first player. Play proceeds clockwise, and turn order remains fixed.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases, repeated for 10 or 11 rounds (see End Game):

#### Phase 1: Resolve Ship Actions (in any order, one action per ship)  
Each ship performs one action at a port. Actions are resolved simultaneously after all ships are placed.

- **Casino**: Gain $2. Multiple ships may dock here. Money is received at the start of the next round.  
- **Black Market**: Either:  
  - Swap one cargo tile from your possession for another random tile from the bag, or  
  - Draw one random cargo tile from the bag.  
- **General Port (Cargo Port)**:  
  - Ships are used to bid on cargo sets at ports.  
  - To bid: place your ship atop a stack of coins already present (or start one).  
  - You must outbid the current top bid (if any) to take the lead.  
  - If you are the only player with a ship at a port, you automatically win the cargo; take all cargo from the port and refill it with new cargo from the supply.  
  - If contested:  
    - You may retreat (concede), retrieving your coins but not re-entering this port’s bidding this round.  
    - Or, stay in the bidding by increasing your bid (adding more coins).  
  - Losing bidders: retrieve all bid money.  

#### Phase 2: Trade Cargo for VP Cards  
After resolving all ship actions, players may trade cargo for VP cards.

- Use cargo to buy cards according to the VP card chart.  
- Each card has:  
  - **Cost** (in red): cargo combination required  
  - **Value** (in blue): Victory Points earned  
- Only one use per cargo: cannot reuse or split cargo across multiple cards.  
- **Limits on certain cards**:  
  - Maximum of **2 Warehouses** per player  
  - Maximum of **2 Cargo Ships** per player (each grants +1 ship; max total ships = 5)  
  - Maximum of **2 Syndicates** per player  
    - Syndicate ability: When forced to abandon a port due to being outbid, gain $2 per Syndicate card **per port abandoned** (e.g., abandon 2 ports → gain $4 with 2 Syndicates).  
- After purchasing:  
  - Discard used cargo.  
  - Any excess cargo beyond warehouse capacity must be spent or discarded by end of turn.  
- VP cards are public: all cards must be visible to other players.

#### Phase 3: Send Ships  
Deploy your ships to ports for the next round, following the same rules as earlier. Ships may be sent to any valid port.

- Bidding at ports requires placing coins with your ship.  
- You must outbid any current leading bid to take control.  
- Once a bid is lost and you retreat, you cannot re-enter that port's bidding this round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Bidding & Bluffing**: Strategic use of money to secure cargo.  
- **Cargo Sets**: Collect specific combinations to purchase higher-value VP cards.  
- **Wild Cargo**: Can substitute for any single cargo type in a set.  
- **Synergy Cards**: Warehouses (increase cargo capacity), Cargo Ships (more actions), Syndicates (compensation for losing bids).  
- **Information Transparency**: All VP cards and cargo holdings are public.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game length:  
  - **2–3 players**: 11 rounds  
  - **4–5 players**: 10 rounds  
- Final round is played normally, with one key exception:  
  - At the end of the final round, **each remaining dollar is worth 1 Victory Point** when evaluating cargo set values for purchasing VP cards.  
  - (Note: This means money can effectively boost the value of your cargo sets during final purchases.)  
- After final purchases:  
  - Total your VP: sum blue numbers on all VP cards.  
  - **Tiebreaker**: Player with the **highest VP card** (single card with most blue points) wins.  
    - If still tied, tie remains unresolved (no further tiebreakers specified).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use Wild cargo in any combination?**  
  Yes. One Wild = one cargo of any type. Cannot represent more than one.

- **What happens when a port is won?**  
  Winner takes all cargo from the port. Then, the port is refilled with a fresh set from the supply.

- **Can I send multiple ships to the same port?**  
  Yes, unless restricted by rules (e.g., cannot re-enter a port after retreating).

- **Do I get money back if outbid?**  
  Yes. All losing bidders retrieve their bid money.

- **Can I save cargo between rounds?**  
  Yes, in your warehouse. Max storage = base capacity (implied 5?) + up to 2 Warehouses (each +2? — exact number not specified in source). Discard excess beyond capacity.

- **Are VP cards private?**  
  No. All VP cards must be revealed and kept visible to all players.
