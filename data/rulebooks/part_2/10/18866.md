## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Shear Panic*, players are shepherds guiding a flock of nine sheep through four dynamic fields on a pasture. The flock reacts to key figures: Roger the ram, the black sheep (Berta/Maurice), and Shawn the shearer (Jacques). Each field emphasizes different behaviors—unity, attraction, proximity, and escape—driving players to strategically position their sheep. The objective is to earn the most points across these phases by optimally placing your two sheep relative to changing scoring conditions.

### 2. Components  
- 8 colored sheep (2 per player in 4-player game)  
- 1 black sheep ("Berta" or "Maurice")  
- 1 ram ("Roger")  
- 1 sheep shearer ("Shawn" or "Jacques")  
- 48 action cards (12 per player)  
- 1 timer track (game board) with 56 spaces (3 players) or 74 spaces (4 players)  
- 1 black timer token (flock marker)  
- 4 player scoring tokens  
- 1 color die ("Lamb Slam" die)  
- 1 flock resolve die (orthogonal "+" or diagonal "X")  
- 9 pasture tiles with stickers to affix sheep  

### 3. Setup  
- **Sheep Placement**: Place all 9 sheep (including black sheep) in the center of the board. Players’ two sheep of the same color are positioned a knight’s move apart (as in chess). All sheep face the same direction.  
- **Player Materials**: Each player takes:  
  - 12 action cards of their color  
  - 1 scoring token  
- **Track Setup**:  
  - Place the timer track (game board) with numbered spaces.  
  - For 3 players: use 56-space track; for 4 players: use 74-space track.  
  - Place the flock marker and all scoring tokens on space 0 (sheep truck).  
- **Neutral Sheep (for fewer players)**:  
  - 3 players: Add 2 neutral sheep.  
  - 2 players: Add 4 neutral sheep.  
- **Extra Cards (for fewer players)**:  
  - 3 players: Each player gets 3 movement cards (values 1, 2, 3) from unused set, placed face-down (number only visible).  
  - 2 players: Each player gets a full extra set of 12 action cards as movement cards (face-down).  
- **Dice & Figures**: Place the color die and flock resolve die nearby. Roger and Shawn are placed later during gameplay.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, perform the following steps in order:

1. **Choose an Action**  
   - Select one unplayed action card from your face-up set.  
   - Execute the action immediately.  
   - In 2-player game: You **must** also play one of your face-down movement cards.  
   - In 3-player game: You **may** optionally play one face-down movement card.  
   - Once played, the action card (and movement card, if used) is removed from the game.

2. **Resolve the Flock**  
   - If the action caused the flock to split:  
     - If a sheep is diagonally adjacent to the main flock, the active player chooses whether to rejoin it orthogonally or diagonally.  
     - If a sheep is isolated (not adjacent), roll the flock resolve die:  
       - “+” (orthogonal): rejoin in a straight line.  
       - “X” (diagonal): rejoin diagonally.  

3. **Move the Flock Marker (Timer Token)**  
   - Advance the flock marker along the timer track:  
     - Move forward by the number on the played action card (1, 2, or 3).  
     - If a movement card was played (2- or 3-player game), add its value to the action card’s value.  
   - Special Rules for Fields 2 and 4:  
     - In Roger’s Field (2nd phase) and Shear Panic Field (4th phase), the flock marker **always stops on the second brown space** in the field, even if movement would go further.

4. **Score Points**  
   - Scoring depends on the current field (phase):  
     - **Phase 1 (Team Tag, spaces 1–12)**: Active player scores immediately.  
       - 2 pts if both own sheep are orthogonally adjacent.  
       - 1 pt if diagonally adjacent.  
       - 0 pts otherwise.  
     - **Phase 2 (Roger’s Field, spaces 13–37)**: Scoring triggered when flock marker crosses stone wall (after space 24) or reaches stone pen (space 37). All players score:  
       - 4 pts per sheep in row closest to Roger  
       - 3 pts for 2nd closest  
       - 2 pts for 3rd closest  
       - 1 pt for 4th closest  
       - 0 pts for others  
       - Empty rows ignored. Black sheep counts as a row.  
       - After scoring at space 37, Roger is removed.  
     - **Phase 3 (Black Sheep Field, spaces 38–49)**: Active player scores immediately.  
       - 2 pts per own sheep orthogonally adjacent to black sheep  
       - 1 pt per diagonally adjacent  
       - 0 pts otherwise  
     - **Phase 4 (Shear Panic Field, spaces 50–74)**: Scoring triggered when flock marker crosses stone wall (after space 61) or reaches stone pen (space 74). All players score:  
       - 4 pts per sheep in row farthest from shearer  
       - 3 pts for 2nd farthest  
       - 2 pts for 3rd farthest  
       - 1 pt for 4th farthest  
       - 0 pts for others (including closest row)  
       - Empty rows ignored. Black sheep counts as a row.  

5. **Panic (Lamb Slam)**  
   - If the flock marker lands on a red space:  
     - Roll the color die.  
     - Perform a **Lamb Slam** using a sheep of the rolled color:  
       - If “black” is rolled, use the black sheep.  
       - If “white” is rolled, perform an **Ewe Turn** (rotate flock 90° clockwise or counterclockwise).  
     - No additional scoring or timer movement occurs after this action.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Action Cards**: Each card has:  
  - A movement value (1–3) for the timer track.  
  - An action to execute.  
  - A condition symbol:  
    - Sheep icon: action must use one of your sheep.  
    - “∅” symbol: next player cannot reverse this action.  
    - “∅” + multicolor: cannot reverse unless previous player rolled Lamb Slam.  
- **Actions**:  
  - **Sheep Step**: Move one of your sheep to an adjacent empty space (orthogonal or diagonal).  
  - **Lamb Slam**: Ram one of your sheep in a direction, pushing all sheep in its path one space.  
  - **Sheep Leap**: One of your sheep jumps over any number of sheep in a straight line (orthogonal or diagonal), landing just beyond. Can move over empty spaces to “run up.”  
  - **Diagonal Push**: All sheep on a diagonal line move one space along that line.  
  - **Line Push**: All sheep on a horizontal or vertical line move one space along that line.  
  - **Feeding Trough**: Choose a line (horizontal/vertical) on the edge; all sheep move as close as possible to that line. Next player cannot play Feeding Trough in opposite direction.  
  - **Herd Instinct**: Rotate entire flock 90° clockwise or counterclockwise. Next player cannot undo this rotation. Roger or Shawn is repositioned to remain in the new line of sight.  

- **General Movement Rules**:  
  - At least one sheep must move per action.  
  - Sheep can move in any direction (not limited by facing).  
  - No sheep may move off the board. Actions that would cause this are invalid.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End**: The game ends when the flock marker enters space 74 (final stone pen).  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - Conduct final scoring for Phase 4 if not already triggered.  
  - The player with the most points wins.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Most points wins.  
  2. If tied: player with more sheep remaining wins.  
  3. If still tied: the tied player who would play next wins.  
- **2- and 3-Player Adjustments**:  
  - Unused movement cards at game end:  
    - 3-player: For each unused movement card, move scoring token **2 spaces backward**.  
    - 2-player: Movement cards must be used; no penalty.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use an action that doesn’t move any sheep?**  
  No. Every action must result in at least one sheep moving.  
- **What if the flock splits into multiple isolated groups?**  
  Rejoin one group at a time, starting with the largest. Use the flock resolve die for each isolated sheep or group.  
- **Do neutral sheep count in row scoring?**  
  Yes. In Phases 2 and 4, the black sheep and any neutral sheep count as occupying a row for scoring purposes.  
- **Can I reverse a Herd Instinct with another Herd Instinct?**  
  No. The next player cannot undo it, but may continue rotating in the same direction.  
- **What happens if the flock marker would pass a scoring space but stops early due to field rule?**  
  In Fields 2 and 4, stopping on the second brown space counts as passing earlier brown spaces—scoring is triggered as normal.  
- **Can I play a movement card without an action card?**  
  No. Movement cards are only used in conjunction with an action card (required in 2-player, optional in 3-player).
