## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
On the cusp of the twentieth century, America is a land of booming industry. Players take on the roles of rival shipping barons competing to deliver goods from factories to cities using airships and rail networks. The goal is to build the most profitable and expansive shipping empire by efficiently transporting goods, upgrading infrastructure, and managing resources. Victory is determined by total Victory Points (VP), with the highest score winning.

2. Components  
- 7 Game Boards (assembled based on player count)  
- 6 Board bumpers  
- Factories (producing Machinery, Textiles, Chemicals, Food, Luxuries)  
- Cities (with demand for specific goods)  
- Railroad Links and Railway Spaces  
- 7 Double-sided Player Boards  
- 14 Upgrade Markers (2 per player)  
- Market Board with Goods value track ($1–$8)  
- 20 Market/Demand Tiles (4 per good type)  
- Goods Cubes (approx. 20 per type)  
- 70 Depot Tokens (10 per player)  
- 91 Movement Cards (13 per player deck)  
- 7 Plastic Airship Figurines  
- 7 Double-sided Character Cards (Normal game only)  
- Money in various denominations  
- First-player Marker (Basic game only)  
- Ability Tokens (for specific characters in Normal game)

3. Setup  
- Each player selects a color and takes:  
  • 1 Player Board (Basic side for Basic game)  
  • 1 Movement Card deck (remove 13th starred card in Basic game)  
  • 1 Airship, 10 Depot Tokens, 2 Upgrade Markers  
  • $12 (Basic game) or $20 (Reginald Kain character)  
- Place Upgrade Markers at starting positions on tracks.  
- Assemble play area using correct number of boards and bumpers based on player count.  
- Place 1 Good of matching type on each Factory.  
- Place 1 Good cube of each type on $4 space of Market Board.  
- Shuffle Market Tiles (20 total) into face-down draw pile near Market Board.  
- Determine first player:  
  • Basic Game: Randomly choose; give First-player Marker.  
  • Normal Game: Players sit in ascending Priority Number order; highest acts first.  
- In reverse player order (clockwise from first player), each player:  
  • Places 1 Depot on any unoccupied Railway Space (no two starting Depots on same link)  
  • Places Airship on same space  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each of 5 rounds consists of 5 phases:

1.) New Market  
- Draw 3 Market Tiles from draw pile and place in Market Board bins.  
- For each tile drawn, move corresponding Good’s price +$1 on Market Board (max $8).  
- If unable to draw 3 tiles, game ends; proceed to Clearance Phase.

2.) Plan Airship Movement  
- All players simultaneously choose 4 Movement Cards from their deck.  
- Place cards face down in 4 sockets on Player Board in intended order of resolution.  
- Cards must remain in this order; no reordering during Move & Action phase.  
- Diamond total may exceed current Airship rating if player plans to upgrade before resolution.

3.) Move & Action (x4 Cycles)  
- For each of 4 cycles:  
  a. Reveal first unplayed card from each player’s plan.  
  b. Determine turn order:  
    • Alphabetical by Turn Order Indicator (A > B > C > D > E > F > G)  
    • Ties:  
      • Basic Game: First-player Marker, clockwise  
      • Normal Game: Priority Number, lowest to highest  
  c. On your turn:  
    i. Check Diamonds:  
      • Total exposed Diamonds (including current card) must not exceed Airship Diamond Rating  
      • If exceeded: return card to deck, skip turn (no movement or action)  
    ii. Movement:  
      • Move Airship exactly number of spaces shown on card  
      • No backtracking  
      • Wide turns allowed; sharp turns not allowed (except Clint Castle)  
      • May pass through any space (cities, factories, other airships) but cannot end turn in city or partial hex  
      • Initial facing irrelevant  
    iii. Load/Unload (after flight only):  
      • Load from: Factory with Goods, or own Depot with Goods  
      • Cannot exceed Cargo Capacity  
      • May jettison Goods of one type to load equal number of different type  
      • Unload only to own Depot  
      • Depots hold unlimited Goods  
    iv. Action (choose one):  
      • Build a Depot: $4 (first on link), $7 (link occupied); place on unoccupied Railway Space  
      • Upgrade Airship: Pay cost on next slot; increases Diamond Rating and/or Cargo Capacity  
      • Upgrade Train: Pay cost on next slot; increases Train Rating (max stops per shipment)  
      • Ship Goods:  
        - Move any number of one Good type from own Depot to:  
          • Another own Depot  
          • City of matching type (must have space)  
        - Must trace connected rail route  
        - Every link must have at least one Depot  
        - Number of stops = number of links + final city (if applicable)  
        - Train Rating must be ≥ number of stops  
        - Pay $1 per Good to owner for each stop at opponent’s Depot (choose which if multiple)  
        - Payment occurs after delivery; delivery revenue may cover tolls  
      • Route Adjustment: Move Airship 1 space in any direction (not into city or partial hex); may Load/Unload after  
      • Solicit Funds: Gain $3 from bank  
    v. Slide Card: Tuck resolved card under Player Board, leaving Diamonds visible  

4.) Upkeep  
- Pay $1 per Good in Cargo Hold and own Depots; for each unpaid Good, return to stock  
- Gather all played Movement Cards back into deck  
- Rotate First-player Marker clockwise (Basic game only)  

5.) Production  
- Factories Produce: Each Factory gains 1 Good of its type +1 per Market Tile of that type in bins  
- Market Tiles Become Demand Tiles: Remove 3 Market Tiles from bins, place face down in stack to right of Market Board; shuffle to form Demand Tile deck  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Airship Movement:  
  • Must use exactly Movement Value  
  • No sharp turns (except Clint Castle)  
  • Load/Unload only after flight (except Clint Castle)  
- Diamond Limit:  
  • Total exposed Diamonds across all played cards in round must not exceed Airship Diamond Rating  
  • Penalty: skip turn if exceeded when card is revealed  
- Depot Function:  
  • Required to open rail links for shipping  
  • Allow Airship unloading  
  • Source for loading during flight  
- Train Shipping:  
  • Stops at one Depot per link + final city  
  • Train Rating limits number of stops per Action  
  • Tolls paid per Good per opponent Depot stop  
- Market Dynamics:  
  • Prices rise with Market Tiles; never fall  
  • Market Tiles → Demand Tiles after use  
  • Fulfilled Cities draw new Demand Tile (or flip if Demand Tile already present)  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After 5th round, if cannot draw 3 Market Tiles → Clearance Phase  
- Clearance Phase:  
  • For each Good in own Depots: if can be shipped to matching City via legal route (within Train Rating, tolls paid), return to stock and gain $4  
  • Pay tolls as normal  
  • Goods in Cargo Hold or unshippable Depot Goods are worthless  
- Final Scoring:  
  • $1 = 1 VP  
  • Each built Depot = 10 VP  
  • Airship upgraded to Level 6 = 15 VP  
  • Train upgrades: Level 4 = 5 VP, Level 5 = 15 VP, Level 6 = 30 VP  
- Winning: Most VP wins. Tiebreaker: most cash. If still tied, mutual victory.
