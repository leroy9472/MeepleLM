## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are architects traveling across the realm with their craftsmen, fulfilling construction orders from the Queen. The goal is to earn enough appreciation from the Queen to be the first to construct her new palace at the capital. The first player to reach the final space on the Appreciation Track wins. In case of a tie, the player with the highest total performance value of craftsmen wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player receives:  
     - 2 bond tokens  
     - Action Star and matching-color items  
     - 6 quitting time tokens (place on Tavern Board)  
     - 8 building cube markers  
     - 1 carriage (place on capital of main board)  
     - 3 figures:  
       - One on moneychanger track (Tavern Board)  
       - One on Action Star (architect)  
       - One on start of Appreciation Track  

2. **Board Setup**:  
   - Randomly place 12 red Appreciation Tokens on the Appreciation Track.  
   - Place Demand Banners on town locations.  
   - Place black price marker on top-left spot of Craftsman Billboard.  

3. **Craftsman Setup**:  
   - Place 6 random starting craftsmen (with "!") upright on the Craftsman Billboard.  
   - Place additional starting craftsmen (X = number of players × 2) beside the board; remaining "!” craftsmen go on top of the pile.  

4. **Drafting Starting Craftsmen**:  
   - In turn order (starting with randomly chosen first player):  
     a. Choose one available starting craftsman and attach it to your Action Star in starting position.  
     b. Optionally, rotate the chosen craftsman clockwise for 1 coin per rotation.  
   - After all players have picked one, repeat in reverse order for the second craftsman.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of multiple turns. On a player’s turn:

1. **Move Architect**:  
   - Move your architect figure 1–3 spaces clockwise around your Action Star.  
2. **Perform Action**:  
   - Execute the action associated with the space where the architect stops.  
   - Some actions are optional or have sub-choices.

There are six possible actions:

#### 1. Earn Coins  
- Gain 1 coin for every 2 craftsmen on your Action Star (rounded up).  
- Additionally, rotate any number of your craftsmen clockwise (on their spots); gain +2 coins per position rotated.  
- Craftsmen reaching the drop-out arrow after rotation are removed.

#### 2. Hire Craftsman  
- Pay the displayed cost to hire a craftsman from the Craftsman Billboard.  
- Attach the hired craftsman to your Action Star in an empty slot.  
- **Restrictions**:  
  - Cannot hire the same character (art) twice.  
  - Can hire multiple from the same guild/color.  
- After hiring:  
  - Shift remaining tiles up on billboard.  
  - Fill the bottom spot with a new tile from the pile.  
- Price adjustment: The black price marker moves down one spot every third hire (after the 3rd, 6th, etc.).

#### 3. Travel  
- Pay coins based on distance traveled (refer to travel cost chart on main board).  
- Move your carriage up to 6 locations along roads.  
- Must pay full cost for chosen distance.

#### 4. Gain Confidence / Redeem Bonds (Tavern Board Actions)  
- Choose one:  
  a. **Gain Confidence**: Move your pawn up the moneychanger track. This increases the number of bond tokens you can sell in a single turn.  
  b. **Redeem Bonds**: Sell up to your current confidence level in bond tokens. Each bond is worth 2 coins.  
     - Remove sold bonds from play.

#### 5. Tavern  
- **Step 1**: Move all tiles in dormitory area to entrance area.  
- **Step 2**: Move all tiles in tavern area to dormitory.  
- Then, choose one or more guilds/colors of craftsmen to "relax":  
  - Rotate all craftsmen of chosen guild(s) counter-clockwise one notch.  
  - Pay coins based on number of different guilds relaxed (see Tavern Board payment chart).  
- Note: Rotating counter-clockwise may prevent dropout or improve future flexibility.

#### 6. Construct (or Repair)  
**Construct**:  
- Can only be done if:  
  - Your carriage is at a location where you have not yet built.  
  - You have all required craftsmen (as shown on the location).  
- Place your building cube on the best available spot at that location.  
- Calculate Appreciation Points (AP):  
  > AP = Sum of performance levels of all craftsmen on Action Star  
  > + Location’s base point value  
  > – Penalty based on building spot quality (worse spots cost more AP)  
- **Bonus**: Larger towns (per Demand Banners) grant additional AP.  
- Spend AP to advance on the Appreciation Track.  
- Any leftover AP can be converted into Bond Tokens (1 AP = 1 Bond).  
- Finally:  
  - Rotate all craftsmen on Action Star clockwise one notch.  
  - Remove any that reach the drop-out arrow.

**Repair (Alternative to Construct)**:  
- Can perform repair at any location (including ones already built on).  
- Use up to 3 craftsmen (must be from different guilds/colors).  
- Each repairing craftsman has an icon showing how many AP it generates.  
- Total AP from repair = sum of icons.  
- Spend AP as in construction (advance track or convert to bonds).  
- After repair:  
  - Rotate each used craftsman clockwise one notch.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Action Star**: Central player board with 6 actions spaced around a ring. Movement of architect (1–3 spaces) determines action choice.  
- **Craftsman Management**:  
  - Craftsmen occupy slots on Action Star.  
  - Rotation (clockwise during actions, counter-clockwise in tavern) affects performance and risk of dropout.  
  - Dropout occurs when a craftsman reaches the arrow after clockwise rotation.  
- **Economy**:  
  - Coins used for hiring, traveling, and tavern payments.  
  - Bonds act as stored value (2 coins when sold) and can be earned from excess AP.  
- **Appreciation Track**:  
  - Progress by spending AP earned from construction or repair.  
  - Final space = ability to construct the Queen’s Palace.  
- **Craftsman Billboard**:  
  - Supply of available craftsmen.  
  - Price increases every 3 hires via marker progression.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Winning Condition**:  
  - A player triggers the end of the game by performing a **Construct** action at the **capital (Queen’s Palace)** with:  
    - Carriage present.  
    - Craftsmen on Action Star with **total performance value ≥ 15**.  
  - Do **not** rotate craftsmen after this construction.  
- Once triggered:  
  - All other players complete the current round.  
- Final winner:  
  - First player to reach the final space on Appreciation Track.  
  - **Tiebreaker**: Highest total performance value of craftsmen on Action Star.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I perform an action without meeting its requirements?**  
  No. For example, you cannot attempt to construct unless you meet location and craftsman requirements.  

- **What happens to leftover Appreciation Points after track advancement?**  
  Convert them into Bond Tokens (1:1). Supply is finite.  

- **Can I hire a craftsman and then immediately use them?**  
  Yes, as long as they are attached before the action phase.  

- **Do I have to rotate all craftsmen during Construct action?**  
  Yes — all craftsmen on Action Star are rotated clockwise one notch, regardless of use.  

- **Can I repair multiple times per turn?**  
  No — only one action per turn. Repair is an alternative to Construct.  

- **Can I use the same guild in a repair?**  
  No — repair requires up to 3 craftsmen, each from a different guild/color.  

- **What if the Craftsman Billboard runs out?**  
  Refill from the pile when hiring, shifting up and replacing the bottom tile. If pile is empty, no more hires possible.  

- **Can I sell more bonds than I have?**  
  No — you can only sell up to your current bond count, and no more than your confidence level allows per turn.
