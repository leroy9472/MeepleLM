1. Lore & Objective

- Wall pieces (exact count not specified)  
- Tower pieces in multiple colors (exact count not specified)  
- House pieces in multiple colors (exact count not specified)  
- Palace pieces in multiple colors (exact count not specified)  
- 1 Tower die (determines tower color)

3. Setup  
- Shuffle the 60 guild cards and deal 6 to each player.  
- Place the remaining cards face-down as a draw pile near the board.  
- Place scoring markers for each player’s chosen color on space 1 of the scoring track.  
- Choose a starting player. Play proceeds clockwise.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, perform the following steps in order:  
1. Build a Wall  
2. Roll Dice (Tower and House dice)  
3. Score (if applicable)  

Turn order continues clockwise until game end.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Build a Wall**  
- Place a wall on any unoccupied wall line.  
- Cannot place walls inside completed cities.  

**Roll Dice**  
- **Tower Die**: After placing a wall, roll the Tower die. Place a tower of the rolled color at an empty end of the newly placed wall.  
  - If both ends are unoccupied, player chooses which end gets the rolled color tower; may choose different color for the other end from available stock.  
  - If no towers of required color are available, use any available color.  
  - If the wall connects two existing towers, do not roll the Tower die.  
- **House Dice**: Roll two House dice. Place houses of the rolled colors on either side of the new wall.  
  - If one side is adjacent to the board edge or already occupied, place only on the free side using one of the rolled colors.  
  - If a die shows “?”, player chooses any color for that house.  
  - If a rolled color is unavailable, use any available color.  

**City Completion & Palaces**  
- When a city is fully enclosed (all sides walled), it is completed.  
- For each pair of adjacent houses of the same color within the completed city, replace them with a palace of that color (return houses to supply).  
- If no palaces of that color are available, houses remain.  

**Scoring Phase (after city completion)**  
- Starting with the active player, each player in clockwise order must:  
  - Play 1 or 2 guild cards from hand to the discard pile, then draw 1 card per card played, OR  
  - Discard 1 card and draw 2 cards from the draw pile.  
- After all players have acted:  
  - Any player currently in last place (including ties) may discard any number of cards from hand and draw an equal number of new cards.  
  - If multiple players tie for last, all may do so.  
- Then the next player begins their turn.  

**City Merging**  
- After a city is completed, the active player may merge it with one adjacent city by removing all shared walls (return to supply).  
- Remove and return to supply any towers and walls entirely enclosed within the resulting city (i.e., internal structures with no external access).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends immediately when the last wall, tower, palace, or house is placed.  
- If the final placement completes a city:  
  - Resolve city completion (palace conversion, merging, and scoring) as normal.  
- If no city is completed by the final placement:  
  - Each player selects one already completed city.  
  - Each player then plays 1 or 2 cards from hand and scores them based on current board state.  
- Final scoring:  
  - Player with the most VP wins.  
  - Tiebreaker: player with the most cards remaining in hand.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Rolling before wall placement**: If a player rolls dice before placing a wall, they receive a -1 VP penalty. Then they must place the wall and roll again.  
- **Unavailable components**: If required towers or houses are unavailable, player may substitute with any available color.  
- **Board edge placement**: When a wall is adjacent to the board edge, only one house is placed; player chooses which of the two rolled colors to use.  
- **Merging cities**: Only one merge allowed per turn (by active player). After merging, internal towers and walls are removed and returned to supply.  
- **Drawing cards**: If the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.  
- **Last place card replacement**: Only players in last place (including ties) may replace cards after the scoring phase. They may discard and draw any number of cards.
