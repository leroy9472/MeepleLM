1. **Choose Game Mode** and set up accordingly (e.g., flag placement in Capture the Flag).  
2. **Choose Factions** (Union, Reich, Matriarchy, Shogunate). Matriarchy allies with Union; Shogunate with Reich.  
3. **Select Map** and place entry points.  
4. **Choose Characters**: 5 per player (3 heroes, 2 troopers). Same hero cannot be chosen twice.  
5. **Equip Characters**: Each gets one equipment pack (3 items + special object).  
6. **Bonus Tokens**: Each team may equip up to 3 bonus tokens (replace one character’s equipment).  
7. **Roll for Entry Points**: Highest roller chooses first entry point and acts first.  
8. **Place Crates**: Shuffle and place crate tokens on Action and Objective circles as per mode.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game consists of turns with the following phases:

1. **Refresh Tokens**  
   - Refresh CPs to mode-specific maximum (lost if unused).  
   - Remove activation markers, overwatch tokens, and top smoke token from each stack.  

2. **Roll Initiative**  
   - Each player rolls 1d10 + bonuses (e.g., +4 for Generalleutnant).  
   - Lowest roller may spend 1 CP to re-roll.  
   - Winner gains initiative and activates first.  
   - Tie: re-roll (no CP spend).  

3. **Set Overwatch**  
   - Starting with non-initiative player, alternate placing characters on overwatch (1 CP each).  
   - Overwatch characters skip activation but may interrupt enemy actions.  
   - Ends when both players pass.  

4. **Activate Characters**  
   - Players alternate activating one character each, starting with initiative holder.  
   - An activated character may:  
     - Move (up to Movement value)  
     - Take one action (attack, use equipment, throw grenade, search crate, etc.)  
     - Perform movement and action in any order (e.g., move-act-move).  
   - Place activation token after turn.  
   - Turn ends when all characters are activated or on overwatch.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Movement  
- Costs 1 MP per circle.  
- Red modifier circles: +1 MP cost per red icon.  
- Green modifier circles: -1 MP cost per green icon.  
- Characters can pass through allies, but must end on empty space.  
- Cannot end on entry point.  
- "Keep Moving" ability: ignore 1 MP penalty per modifier circle.  

#### Actions  
Each character may take one action per activation:  
- Attack (Combat or Mental Duel)  
- Use Equipment  
- Throw Grenade  
- Search Crate  
- Drop, Give, or Pick Up Equipment  
- Bull Rush (uses Action)  
- Activate Objective/Action Circle (mode-specific)  

#### Combat  
**Attack Sequence:**  
1. **Declare Weapon & Target**  
   - Target must be adjacent or within weapon range (Pistol, Automatic, Mental).  
   - Hand-to-Hand: adjacent only (except Strafe, which allows range 2).  

2. **Attack Roll**  
   - Attacker rolls dice = their current Combat value.  
   - Difficulty = 10 - defender’s current Combat value.  
   - Each die ≥ difficulty = 1 success (Natural 10 always succeeds).  

3. **Shock Roll (Defender)**  
   - Defender rolls 4 dice.  
   - Difficulty = 10 - defender’s current Stamina value.  
   - Each success cancels one attack success.  

4. **Deal Wounds**  
   - Each uncancelled attack success = 1 wound.  
   - Move health indicator down one row per wound.  
   - If below last row, character dies.  

#### Mental Duel  
- Used with occult items (e.g., Patmos Amulet, Sha-Na-Ra).  
- Attacker and defender each roll dice = their current Mental value.  
- Difficulty = 10 - opponent’s Mental value.  
- Defender wins ties.  
- **Patmos Amulet**: On win, move target up to number of hits away; they skip next action.  
- **Sha-Na-Ra (once per game)**: On win, inflict automatic wounds = uncanceled hits (no shock roll).  

#### Bull Rush (Stamina Duel)  
- To pass through enemy-occupied circle.  
- Attacker and defender roll dice = their current Stamina value.  
- Difficulty = 10 - opponent’s Stamina value.  
- Attacker wins with more successes; defender wins ties.  
- If attacker wins: move through.  
- If attacker loses: cannot enter; defender may make free melee attack.  

#### Grenades  
- **Grenade (e.g., Stielhandgrenate)**:  
  - Throw to empty circle within range 5.  
  - 4 automatic attack successes to target and adjacent characters.  
  - Shock rolls allowed.  
  - Place debris token.  
- **Smoke Grenade (e.g., M15)**:  
  - Range 8.  
  - Fills entire path with smoke.  
  - -5 Combat/Stamina to characters on smoke circle; -3 to others on same path.  
  - Minimum value = 1.  
  - Lasts 3 turns.  

#### Equipment & Inventory  
- Each character has equipment slots.  
- **Disposable** (yellow/black border): can be dropped, traded, picked up.  
- **Non-disposable**: lost on death.  
- Dropping/picking up/giving equipment does not use action.  
- Can only pick up if slot available.  

#### Command Points (CP)  
- Start with 9 CP (max).  
- Refreshed each turn; unused CPs lost.  
- Can be gained via equipment (e.g., Iron Cross).  

**CP Uses (1 per effect per activation):**  
- **Overwatch**: 1 CP  
- **Focus**: +1 to all stats (except Movement) until end of turn  
- **+2 Movement**: 1 CP  
- **Counterattack**: 1 CP (after surviving attack, use worst Combat value)  
- **Shake Off Wound**: 1 CP (cancel 1 wound after shock roll)  
- **Reinforcement**: 3 CP (bring back dead trooper next turn)  

#### Overwatch  
- Triggered when enemy:  
  - Moves onto same path  
  - Moves adjacent  
  - Announces action on same path or adjacent  
- Resolve immediately.  
- Cannot use Heavy or Mental weapons.  
- If target killed, activation ends.  
- After overwatch attack, character is no longer on overwatch.  

#### Line of Sight & Paths  
- Characters on same path can see and attack each other.  
- Doors block LOS if closed.  
- Hand-to-Hand attacks can target through doors if adjacent.
