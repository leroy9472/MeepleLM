### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Poseidon Round  
- Begins with the player to the right of the start player; purchasing proceeds **counterclockwise**.  
- Each player buys one Special card. Additional purchases:  
  - 2-player game: Each player buys **2 more** (total 3 per player)  
  - 3-player game: Each player buys **1 more** (total 2 per player)  
  - 4- or 5-player game: Leftover cards are returned to the box.  
- Special cards provide phase-dependent income at the start of each ER.  
- Using a card’s special power (P1–P5) discards it (income stops), **except P4 (Poseidon)**, which remains in play.  

#### Merchant Round (MR)  
- Start player begins; turns proceed clockwise.  
- On your turn, you may:  
  - Make **one** purchase **OR** sell merchants **OR** pass.  
  - Passing does not remove you from future actions in the round.  

**Purchase Option 1: Found a Nation**  
- Take a nation’s charter and all its potential (disc) merchants.  
- Set initial **prestige value** (determines merchant value).  
- Place an **odd number (minimum 5)** of potentials into the Merchant Pool.  
- Nation treasury receives: (number of merchants placed) × (prestige value).  
- You must **buy at least 50% (rounded up)** of these merchants (from your personal funds).  
  - Place 3 on the king’s card; rest next to it.  
  - Payment goes to the bank.  
- Place the **discovery ship** in the nation’s home port.  
- **Phase 2+**: King may add up to 4 extra merchants to pool for extra capital.  
- **Phase 3+**: King may add up to 6 extra merchants.  

**Purchase Option 2: Buy 1 Merchant**  
- Take exactly **one** merchant from the Merchant Pool (any nation).  

**Sell Merchants**  
- May sell **any number** of your merchants.  
- Gain cash equal to current **prestige value** of each sold merchant.  
- **Exception**: The 3 merchants on the king’s card **cannot be sold**, unless another player takes kingship.  
- **If a king sells any merchants**, the nation’s **prestige value drops by one**.  

**End of MR**  
- Kingship changes if another player owns more merchants in a nation. New king may claim the title.  
- Start player token passes **clockwise**.  

#### Exploration Round (ER)  
- **Special Card Use**: Owners of P1, P2, P3, P5 may **use power OR collect income** (P0–P5).  
- **King Income**: Each king takes:  
  - Phase 1: 5 drachma  
  - Phase 2: 10 drachma  
  - Phase 3: 15 drachma  
  - Phase 4: 20 drachma  
- Nations act in **descending prestige order**. Ties broken by stacking order (top of stack acts first).  

**Nation Actions**:  
1. **Move Discovery Ship**  
   - Move a number of hexes equal to current **phase number** (1–4).  
   - Can build **trading posts** on any white-circle hex touched (including start hex).  
   - **No trading post in home port**.  
   - May establish **new home port** on any unoccupied hex visited this turn (not in New World).  
     - New home marker placed; value = 0.  
     - Future fleet actions may start from either home.  

2. **Fleet Decision**  
   - **Option A: Send Fleet Out**  
     - Fleet range = sum of all ship values.  
     - Start from home or new home; trace path up to fleet range.  
     - Fleets may pass through occupied hexes; **cannot cross dark lines**.  
     - Revenue = sum of values from **trading posts and temples** within range.  
     - **Temples may require donations** (paid from nation’s coffers).  
     - **E-ship**: Can access New World; only one New World location per trip; earns from each post only once per round.  
     - Revenue paid **per merchant** (to bank; king does not directly gain cash).  
     - **Prestige increases by one**.  
   - **Option B: Fleet Stays Home**  
     - Nation receives fixed income:  
       - Phase 1: 100  
       - Phase 2: 200  
       - Phase 3: 300  
       - Phase 4: 400  
     - **Prestige unchanged**.  
   - **No ships = no income, prestige unchanged**.  

3. **Buy Ships**  
   - Buy topmost ship(s) from bank or **from another nation (Phase 2+)**.  
   - **Fleet limit**: 3 ships total.  
   - Must have **at least one ship** at end of ER.  
   - **Selling ships**: From Phase 4 (E-ship purchase), may sell ships for **half value** (deducted from E-ship cost).  
     - First E-ship buyer: May trade in a 4-ship for **150 drachma** just before 4-ships become obsolete.  

#### Phase Triggers  
- **Phase 2**: Triggered by first **4-ship** purchase.  
  - All **2-ships obsolete** (discarded).  
  - Discovery ship range: **2**.  
  - Hexes with 2 or 3 circles can hold **2 trading posts**.  
  - Kings may add up to **4 extra merchants** to pool.  
  - Ships can be bought from other nations (min. 1 drachma).  

- **Phase 3**: Triggered by first **6-ship** purchase.  
  - All **3-ships obsolete** (discarded).  
  - Discovery ship range: **3**.  
  - Hexes with 3 circles can hold **3 trading posts**.  

- **Phase 4**: Triggered by first **E-ship** purchase.  
  - All **4-ships obsolete** (discarded).  
  - Discovery ship range: **4**.  
  - New World hexes (4 circles) can hold **4 trading posts**.  
  - **Temples no longer generate revenue**.  
  - E-ship can access entire board; earns from each trading post **once per round**.  

#### Bankruptcy  
- If a nation has no ship and cannot afford to buy one:  
  - King must convert **potentials into merchants** (placed in Merchant Pool).  
  - Prestige drops (new value × number of merchants = capital raised).  
  - If insufficient potentials, king pays remainder from personal funds.  
  - Funds raised this way can **only** buy from bank, not other nations.  
- If king cannot pay, they go **bankrupt**.  
- ER continues; game ends early.

- **What happens to obsolete ships?**  
  Discarded immediately when phase is triggered.  

- **Can you found a nation in any MR?**  
  Yes, as long as the nation is unclaimed.
