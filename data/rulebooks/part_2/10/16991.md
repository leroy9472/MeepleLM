## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Khet (originally released as Deflexion) is a two-player strategy game combining chess-like movement with laser optics. Each player controls a set of mirrored pieces and a Pharaoh. The objective is to eliminate the opponent’s Pharaoh using your laser beam while protecting your own. The game ends when a Pharaoh is struck by a laser beam—its owner loses. If both Pharaohs are hit simultaneously, the game ends in a tie.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with 8×10 grid  
- Two laser emitters (one per side)  
- Two Pharaohs (one per player)  
- Two or more Djed pieces (mirrored on two adjacent sides)  
- Two or more Eye of Horus pieces (beam splitter; mirrored on one side, split-beam on adjacent side)  
- Multiple Pyramid pieces (mirrored on one side)  
- Obelisks (non-mirrored, block laser)  
- In Khet: 4 obelisks per player (2 extra vs. Deflexion), capable of stacking  
- Colored squares (gold in Deflexion, red in Khet); Khet includes 2 extra colored squares per color (see board layout)  
- Laser button to fire beam  

### 3. Setup  
#### Classic & Imhotep Configurations (Khet and Deflexion):  
- Place pieces on designated starting squares per configuration.  
- In **Khet only**, the two obelisks adjacent to the Pharaoh are stacked at the start.  
- Lasers are mounted on the long sides of the board.  

#### Dynasty Configuration (Khet only):  
- Unique starting layout included in Khet; specific placement defined in official rules.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Starting Player**:  
   - In **Deflexion**, the gold player starts.  
   - In **Khet**, the silver player starts.  
2. On a player’s turn:  
   - **Move or Rotate**: Choose one piece to either:  
     - Move one square in any direction (orthogonal or diagonal), or  
     - Rotate a piece with mirrors 90° clockwise or counterclockwise (no square change).  
   - **Special Movement Rules**:  
     - Djed and Eye of Horus can swap places with adjacent Pyramids or Obelisks (including stacked ones), but not with Pharaohs or like pieces.  
     - Obelisks (in Khet):  
       - May be stacked (same color only).  
       - A stack can be moved as one unit one square in any direction.  
       - The top obelisk may be unstacked and moved to an adjacent square.  
       - A top obelisk may be moved onto another adjacent obelisk.  
       - Maximum stack height: 2.  
   - **Laser Fire**: After completing the move/rotation, fire the laser.  
     - The beam travels straight, reflects off mirrored surfaces at 90°, and stops when hitting a non-reflective surface or wall.  
     - Trace the full path even if misaligned due to multiple deflections.  
   - **Resolution**:  
     - Any piece hit (except Pharaoh) is removed.  
     - If a Pharaoh is hit, its owner loses.  
     - If both Pharaohs are hit simultaneously, game ends in a tie.  
     - If a piece is hit by multiple beams, it blocks all beams before removal.  
     - If stacked obelisks are hit, only the top obelisk is removed.  
3. **Turn Completion**:  
   - In **Khet**, a move is final as soon as the hand is removed from the piece; laser must be fired.  
   - In **Deflexion**, a move cannot be taken back once the laser is fired.  
4. **No Passing**: A turn must consist of a legal move or rotation followed by firing the laser. Skipping a turn is not allowed.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Mirrors**:  
  - Pyramid: One mirrored side (45° angle).  
  - Djed: Two adjacent mirrored sides (corner reflector).  
  - Eye of Horus: One mirrored side, one beam-splitting side (sends beam straight and reflected).  
- **Obelisk**: Blocks laser; can be stacked (Khet only).  
- **Swapping**: Djed and Eye of Horus may swap with adjacent Pyramids or Obelisks (including stacks).  
- **Stacking (Khet only)**:  
  - Only same-color obelisks.  
  - Max two high.  
  - Stack moves as one unit.  
  - Only top obelisk is removed when hit.  
- **Laser Path**:  
  - Always trace full beam path.  
  - Beam stops on non-mirrored surface (back or side of piece) or wall.  
  - Multiple deflections are valid; realignment errors must be corrected.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Win Conditions**:  
  - Eliminate opponent’s Pharaoh → win.  
  - Both Pharaohs hit simultaneously → tie.  
- **Draw Declaration**:  
  - In Khet, if the board configuration repeats **three times**, the player about to move may declare a draw.  
- **No Scoring System**: Game is won by elimination or ends in tie/draw.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I pass?** No. A move or rotation must be made, followed by laser fire.  
- **Can I rotate a Pharaoh or Obelisk?** Yes, but only if it has a mirror (Pharaoh does not; Obelisk never does). So these cannot be rotated.  
- **Can Djed/Eye swap with stacked obelisks?** Yes. The stack moves to the Djed/Eye’s original square.  
- **Multiple beam hits**:  
  - A piece hit by multiple beams blocks all before removal.  
  - If a Pyramid is destroyed by one beam and deflects another that kills a second piece, both are removed.  
  - If stacked obelisks are hit by multiple beams, only the top is removed.  
- **Pronunciation**:  
  - "Djed" → "g" as in "German" + "ye" as in "yet" + soft "d".
