## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In Keltis: The Card Game, players compete to earn the most points by building long sequences of colored cards and collecting Wishing Stones. The game centers around strategic card play to maximize scoring potential across colored rows, neutral point cards, and special Wishing Stone cards. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game wins.

### 2. Components
- **80 Number cards**: in 5 colors; values include:  
  - One each of 0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 10  
  - Two each of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  
- **10 End cards**: 2 per color (one for each of the 5 colors), used to end color rows  
- **11 Point cards**: feature a white "1" in the center and grey numbers (values 0–10) in the corners; used for scoring or extending color rows  
- **9 Wishing Stone cards**: orange cards numbered 1–9, collected during play for bonus scoring  
- **Total**: 110 cards

### 3. Setup
1. Place the 9 Wishing Stone cards (numbered 1–9) face-up in a row in the center of the table, in numerical order.  
2. Remove 30 cards at random from the 101-card deck if playing with 2 players; return them to the box unseen.  
3. Shuffle the remaining cards (101 cards in 3–4 player games; 71 in 2-player games).  
4. Deal 8 cards to each player.  
5. Place the remaining cards face-down as a draw pile.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
- Play proceeds clockwise.  
- The first player is the one who most recently visited Ireland; if no one has, the eldest player starts.  
- On a turn, a player must:
  1. **Play one or two cards** (see Core Mechanics)  
  2. **Draw one or two cards** to restore hand to 8 cards  
- After all actions, the turn ends and play passes to the left.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### a) Playing or Discarding a Card
A player may take one of four actions when playing a card:

**Option A: Discard One Card**  
- Discard any single card (Number, End, or Point card) to the corresponding discard pile in the center.  
- There are up to 6 discard piles: one for each of the 5 colors (for Number and End cards) and one for Point cards.

**Option B: Discard Two Cards of Same Value to Claim a Wishing Stone**  
- Discard two cards of the same value (Number or Point cards).  
- Take the Wishing Stone card matching that value (e.g., discard two 5s → take Wishing Stone "5").  
- Only allowed if the Wishing Stone card is still available.  
- After this action, draw **two** cards.

**Option C: Play a Color Card (Number or End) to a Personal Row**  
- Play a Number or End card face-up in front of yourself, starting or extending a color-specific row.  
- Each color may have its own row. Cards are stacked vertically so all values remain visible.  

**Number Card Rules**:  
- A row may be started with any Number card.  
- Once a second card is added, the direction is fixed:  
  - **Ascending**: each new card must be ≥ the previous highest  
    - Example: 3 → 3 → 6 → 7 → 7  
  - **Descending**: each new card must be ≤ the previous lowest  
    - Example: 9 → 8 → 8 → 5 → 3  
- Equal values are allowed in both directions.  
- Direction is locked once a different value is played.

**End Card Rules**:  
- May be played at any time to a matching color row.  
- Ends the row: no further Number cards may be added.  
- A second End card may be placed on top, but nothing else.  
- Two End cards in one row count as **one** "ended" row for game end.

#### d) Playing a Point Card
Two options:

**Option D1: Play to Neutral Point Row**  
- Place the Point card in a separate, shared neutral row.  
- Only Point cards may be played here.  
- Card values (in grey) are irrelevant to order.  
- Each card in this row scores 1 point at game end.

**Option D2: Play to a Color Row**  
- Only allowed if the Point card’s value matches the last Number card played in that color row.  
- Extends the row and counts toward its length for scoring.  
- Cannot be played after an End card.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Game End Conditions
The game ends immediately when **one** of the following occurs:
- **Five different color rows** (across all players) have had at least one End card played in them.  
  - Note: Two End cards in the same row count as only one for this purpose.  
- The **last card is drawn** from the draw pile.  
- The player who triggers the end does **not** draw a card afterward.

#### Final Action
- After the game ends, each player may add **up to two cards** from their hand to their existing color or Point card rows.  
- No cards are drawn after this.

#### Scoring

**Colored Card Rows (per color)**  
Score based on number of cards in the row:

| Cards in Row | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9+ |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| Points       | -4 | -3 | -2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 6 | 7 | 10 |

- If a player has no cards in a color, they score **0** for that color.  
- End cards and Point cards (if played to color rows) count toward row length.

**Point Cards**  
- Each Point card in the **neutral Point row** scores **1 point**.  
- Point cards played in color rows already count toward that row’s length and are not scored separately.

**Wishing Stone Cards**  
Score based on total number collected:

| Wishing Stones Held | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5+ |
|----------------------|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| Points               | -4 | -1 | 0 | 4 | 6 | 10 |

- There is no penalty for holding more than 5; 5+ gives 10 points.

#### Winning
- Total all points from colored rows, Point cards, and Wishing Stones.  
- Highest score wins.  
- In case of a tie, all tied players share the victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I change direction in a color row?**  
  No. Once a second card of different value is played, the direction (ascending or descending) is locked.

- **Can I play a Point card on a row with only an End card?**  
  No. Point cards can only be played on rows where the last Number card matches the Point card’s value.

- **Can I discard two Point cards of same value to get a Wishing Stone?**  
  Yes. Point cards count for discarding in pairs regardless of color or type.

- **Can I discard a Number card and a Point card of same value to get a Wishing Stone?**  
  No. Both cards must be of the same value **and** either both Number or both Point cards.

- **Can I play a Point card to the neutral row even if I haven’t started one?**  
  Yes. The neutral row starts when the first Point card is played there.

- **What if I can’t draw because discard piles are empty and draw pile is gone?**  
  The game ends when the last card is drawn. After that, no more draws occur.

- **Can I play two cards without discarding two?**  
  No. The only way to play two cards is by discarding two of the same value to claim a Wishing Stone.
