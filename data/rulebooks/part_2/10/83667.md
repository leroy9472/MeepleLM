## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The objective is to earn the most victory points (VP) by building a railroad network to deliver goods and passengers to Red or Green stations. Players compete through strategic track building, influence auctions, and efficient shipping. Victory is determined by VP from delivered goods/passengers, end-game sets, profit/loss, and penalties for remaining track. The game ends after a fixed number of rounds (4 or 5, depending on player count). Tiebreaker is final profit/loss position.

2. Components  
- Player sets (4 colors): 3 trains, 15 investment cubes, 9 player disks, 15 track pieces  
- Goods cubes: 60 yellow (post/cheese), 60 grey (hops/stone)  
- Passengers/landlords: 25 each in red, green, white  
- Track pieces: 35 each in red and green  
- Influence disks: 5 each in white (government), brown (train), red, green  
- 1 turn marker (tum), 1 cloth bag  
- Boards: 1 double-sided main board (Nuremberg / Wensleydale), 2 double-sided smaller boards  
- Tracks: Profit & Loss, Score, Influence (5 tracks: white, brown, red, green, grey)

3. Setup  
- Board Selection: Use Nuremberg or Wensleydale side. For 2/3 players, use corresponding influence/train board side.  
- Seed Goods:  
  - Draw 2 cubes per plot with post/cheese (yellow) or hops/stone (grey). Discard mismatched colors.  
  - Each plot may end with 0, 1, or 2 cubes.  
- Place Passengers:  
  - Place 1 fixed passenger (red/green) on each station marked with passenger symbol (4 of each).  
  - Remaining passengers: Draw randomly and place up to number indicated per station.  
  - Nuremberg Variant: Swap red and green default passengers (eases early access).  
  - Wensleydale Variant: "The South" may be expanded to include dark red area for more access.  
- Influence Bag:  
  - 2/3 players: 4 white, 4 brown, 2 red, 2 green influence disks  
  - 4 players: All 5 of each influence color (20 total)  
- Turn Order:  
  - Random initial order. Place player disks on:  
    - Profit & Loss track  
    - Score track  
    - All 5 influence tracks  
  - On white and brown influence tracks, stack in turn order (first player on top).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of 5 phases:

**Phase 1: Influence Auction**  
1. Fill Influence Boxes: Randomly draw one influence disk per box (6 or 8 boxes depending on player count).  
2. Investment Pool: Each player takes up to 12 investment cubes (saved from previous rounds; max 15 total).  
3. Auction:  
   - Players bid in grey (initial) turn order.  
   - Minimum bid: 3 (top row), 2 (bottom row).  
   - Must beat current bid.  
   - No player may have more than 2 active bids.  
   - Auction ends when all players have won 2 boxes or no valid bids remain.  
4. Resolve Bids:  
   - In box order, winners increase influence level on respective track.  
   - Spent investment cubes return to stock.  
   - Later arrival on white/brown tracks places player higher in stack (tiebreaker for turn order).  
5. Set Turn Orders:  
   - Civic Order (Phase 2): Based on white (govt) influence track stack.  
   - Train Order (Phase 3): Based on brown (train) influence track stack.  
   - These orders are fixed for the round.

**Phase 2: Build Track**  
- Order: Civic (white influence) order.  
- Each player builds one contiguous stretch of track.  
- Rules:  
  - Must be a single line; no branching.  
  - Must start from:  
    - A Red or Green station, OR  
    - A plot with existing player track (entering or exiting).  
  - Cannot:  
    - Double up on a border (only one track per connection).  
    - Enter or exit fields or hills (only adjacent stations can access hops/stone).  
    - Connect Nuremberg North to Nuremberg South.  
    - Travel through "The South" (Wensleydale): can start/end there, but not pass through.  
- Cost:  
  - Lowland-to-lowland: 1 investment cube  
  - Any other connection: 2 investment cubes  
  - When out of investment cubes, may spend any influence at 1:1.  
- Special:  
  - When building into a landlord area (red/green), pay 1 govt (white) influence per landlord; remove all landlords in that area.  
  - Immediately remove all white passengers touching new track.  

**Special Scoring Event: Nuremberg to Fürth**  
- First time Nuremberg and Fürth are connected:  
  - Each player finds the shortest contiguous segment of their own track involved in *any* such connection.  
  - Score 1 VP per track in that segment.  
  - One-time event; occurs immediately.

**Phase 3: Shipping (Train Order)**  
- Order: Brown (train) influence order.  
- Players take actions in turn until all pass.  
- Actions:  
  a) **Rent a Train**:  
     - Place train marker on an available train level.  
     - Pay brown influence: 1 (level 1), 2 (level 2), 3 (level 3).  
     - Max one train per level.  
     - If short on brown influence, may spend other influence or investment cubes at 3:1 rate.  
  b) **Ship a Good/Passenger**:  
     - Must have track connecting item’s origin to a Red/Green station via only your track.  
     - Pickups:  
       - Post/cheese/passengers: Must have track into the plot.  
       - Beer/stone: Must have track into adjacent station (per arrow indicators).  
     - Passengers must go to matching color station.  
     - Goods may go to any Red/Green station.  
     - Must have open slot on rented train.  
     - Item is removed from board and placed on train.  
  c) **Pass**: Remove train marker(s); exit action phase.  
- After all pass: Remaining valid shipments may be resolved simultaneously.

**Phase 4: Profit and Loss**  
- Order: Grey (initial) player order.  
- Calculate net income:  
  - +$2: Beer, stone  
  - +$1: Cheese, post, passenger  
  - -$1: Per track piece still on board  
- Adjust Profit & Loss track:  
  - Range: -13 to +5  
  - If net = 0, or result would exceed +5 or fall below -13, player’s disk goes to top of stack in that space.  
  - Relative order changes on ties due to existing turn order resolution.  
- All shipped goods/passengers are placed in front of player for end-game set scoring.  
- Return train pieces to stock.

**Phase 5: Takeovers**  
- Order: New Profit & Loss track order.  
- Each player may cede one contiguous stretch of their track to Red or Green Company.  
- Requirements:  
  - Must start at a station of the company’s color (Red or Green).  
  - Must end at any station.  
  - If track forks, choose one branch only.  
- Process:  
  - Replace player track with company-colored track.  
  - Pay 1 influence of the company color per 2 tracks (round up).  
  - All stations on route become that company’s color.  
  - All goods and passengers of that color on the route are removed from the game.  
- Red and Green companies function identically.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Influence Tracks**: Govern turn order and resource access.  
  - White: Govt influence → track building (landlord payment)  
  - Brown: Train influence → train rental  
  - Red/Green: Used in takeovers  
- **Investment Cubes**: Used for auction bids and track building. Can substitute for influence when depleted.  
- **Turn Orders**: Three distinct: grey (initial), white (track), brown (shipping).  
- **Resource Conversion**: Any influence or investment cube can be spent at 3:1 when lacking required brown influence.  
- **Set Collection**: End-game scoring for sets of shipped items (beer/stone + cheese/post + red passenger + green passenger).  
- **Track Removal Penalty**: -1 VP per track remaining at game end.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End of Game**: After 4 rounds (2/3 players) or 5 rounds (4 players).  
- Final Scoring:  
  - VP from passengers and goods: Based on train board side used (1–3 VP per item).  
  - +2 VP per complete set:  
    - One beer/stone (grey), one cheese/post (yellow), one red passenger, one green passenger.  
  - Add/subtract final Profit & Loss value (from -13 to +5).  
  - -1 VP per track still on board.  
  - Nuremberg–Fürth connection: 1 VP per track in shortest qualifying segment (one-time).  
- **Total Score**: Sum of above.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Higher position on Profit & Loss track.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I build track into a hill or field?  
  A: No. You cannot enter or exit fields or hills with track. Only adjacent stations can access hops/stone.  
- Q: Can I use influence to pay for track if I run out of investment cubes?  
  A: Yes. Any influence can be spent at 1:1.  
- Q: What happens if I can’t meet the minimum bid in auction?  
  A: You may still bid if you can meet or beat the current bid, but cannot underbid the minimum.  
- Q: Can I cede track that doesn’t end at a station?  
  A: No. Takeover routes must end at a station.  
- Q: Do I score the Nuremberg–Fürth bonus if my track isn’t the one making the connection?  
  A: Yes. Any player with track on *any* path between the cities scores based on their shortest segment.  
- Q: Can I ship a good if I don’t have a train?  
  A: No. Must have rented a train with available slot.  
- Q: What happens to neutral stations?  
  A: They become Red or Green if that company’s track is built into them, or during a takeover.
