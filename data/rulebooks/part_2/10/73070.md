# OLYMPUS — Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In Ancient Greece, players lead a city-state (polis) such as Athens or Sparta, guiding its expansion through population growth, cultural development, warfare, and worship of the Olympian gods. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points by gaining divine favor, constructing buildings, and achieving progress milestones.

**Win Condition**: The game ends when at least four Glory Bonus cards have been claimed. Victory Points are then calculated from buildings, Glory Bonuses, and end-game progress scoring. The player with the most Victory Points wins. In case of a tie:
- The player with the most resources wins.
- If still tied, the player with fewer buildings wins.
- If still tied, the victory is shared.

## 2. Components
- 1 Main Board (Mount Olympus with 10 deities, each with α and β spaces, 12 unique building slots, and a scoring track)
- 5 Player Boards (Polis boards with 6 progress tracks and 5 priest spaces)
- 183 Cards:
  - 165 Building Cards (33 per player, 5 colors: red, yellow, green, blue, black)
  - 12 Unique Building Cards (placed on main board)
  - 6 Glory Bonus Cards
- 25 Priests (pawns): 5 each in 5 colors
- 35 Markers (discs): 7 each in 5 colors
- 60 Resource Cubes:
  - 20 Grain (yellow)
  - 20 Venison (red)
  - 20 Fish (blue)
- 1 Starting Player Token
- Rulebook

## 3. Setup
1. Place the main board in the center. Place one unique building card face up in each of the 12 designated spaces.
2. Each player chooses a color and takes:
   - 1 Polis board
   - 33 building cards of their color
   - 3 priests of their color
   - 7 markers of their color
   - 1 resource cube of each type (grain, venison, fish)
3. On their Polis board, players place:
   - Population marker at "2"
   - All other progress markers at "1"
   - Last marker at "0" on the main scoring track
   - 3 priests on the available spaces (2 extra spaces remain empty)
4. Place starting resources in the "warehouse" (top-right area).
5. Unused components (boards, cards, pieces of unchosen colors) are returned to the box.
6. Randomly assign the Starting Player token.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds, each consisting of two phases:

### 1. Worship Phase
- Players take turns as the **active player**, beginning with the Starting Player.
- The active player sends one of their available priests to the α space of a deity (not already occupied in α).
- Other players, starting to the left, may send one priest each to the β space of that deity.
- After all players have chosen, the deity grants favors:
  - α: Stronger effect
  - β: Weaker effect
- The player to the left becomes the new active player.
- The phase ends when all players pass (no priests or no available deities).

### 2. Upkeep Phase
Six steps, completed in order:
1. **Resource Limit**: Players with >5 resources in their warehouse return excess to supply.
2. **Population Limit**: Military and production markers cannot exceed population. Adjust if needed.
3. **Use Buildings**: Resolve effects of buildings that trigger in Upkeep.
4. **Collect Tribute**: Move resources from tribute area to warehouse.
5. **Collect Priests**: 
   - Return all priests from main board to supply.
   - Each player receives:
     - 3 base priests
     - +1 if population ≥ 6
     - +1 if culture ≥ 8
6. **Game End Check**: If ≥4 Glory Bonuses claimed, game ends. Otherwise, pass Starting Player token and begin new round.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Divine Favors
Each deity grants different effects based on α or β placement:

| Deity | α Effect | β Effect |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Demeter** (Agriculture) | Advance grain production 1, then produce | Choose: advance or produce |
| **Artemis** (Hunt) | Advance venison production 1, then produce | Choose: advance or produce |
| **Poseidon** (Sea) | Advance fish production 1, then produce | Choose: advance or produce |
| **Athena** (Wisdom) | Advance culture 2 | Advance culture 1 |
| **Aphrodite** (Love) | Advance population 2 | Advance population 1 |
| **Ares** (War) | Advance military 2, or 1 + declare war, or 0 + declare 2 wars | Advance military 1, or 0 + declare 1 war |
| **Hephaestus** (Manufacturing) | Build up to 2 buildings | Build 1 building |
| **Apollo** (Sun/Plague) | Choose: 2 VP (Sun) or 1 VP + plague protection | Choose: 1 VP (Sun) or plague protection |
| **Zeus** (King) | Choose 2 different effects from: advance progress, produce, declare war, build, score 1 VP | Choose 1 effect from list |
| **Hera** (Queen) | Choose: advance 2 production markers or produce 2 resources | Choose: advance 1 production marker or produce 1 resource |

### War (Ares & Zeus)
- Declared during Worship Phase when using Ares or Zeus.
- Resolved after all Ares/Zeus worshippers receive favors.
- Attacker compares military strength (marker + building bonuses) vs defender.
- If attacker > defender: takes difference in tributes (resources chosen by attacker).
- If tied and attacker on α (Ares): attacker wins, takes 1 tribute.
- If tied and not on α, or attacker < defender: attacker gets nothing.

### Plague (Apollo)
- If Apollo is invoked as Plague-Bringer, after all have worshipped:
  - Unprotected players lose 1/3 of population (rounded down).
  - Protection lasts only that round.

### Buildings
- Built using Hephaestus favor or building effects.
- Requirements:
  - Minimum culture level (shown on card)
  - Pay resource cost (shown on left edge)
- Effects:
  - Immediate: VP and/or effect upon construction
  - Ongoing: trigger in Upkeep or other phases
- Unique buildings: only one player can build each.
- Common buildings: each player can build one copy from their deck.

### Progress Limits
Markers cannot exceed certain values without specific buildings:
- **Population** > 5: requires Agora
- **Culture** > 4: requires School
- **Culture** > 7: requires School + Library
- **Military** > 3: requires Barracks
- **Military** > 6: requires Barracks + Army
- If advancement would exceed limit, move only as far as allowed. No compensation.

### Glory Bonuses
- 6 cards: one for each progress track.
- First player to reach the end of any track claims the corresponding card and 2 VP.
- Cards are awarded only once and not lost if marker moves back.
- Game ends when 4+ Glory Bonuses are claimed.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
At end of round when 4+ Glory Bonuses are claimed:
1. **Progress Scoring**: Each progress marker scores VP equal to half its position (rounded down).
2. **Total VP**: Sum VP from:
   - Buildings
   - Glory Bonuses (2 VP each)
   - Progress Scoring
3. **Victory**:
   - Highest VP wins.
   - Tie: most resources.
   - Still tied: fewest buildings.
   - Still tied: shared victory.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Resource Limit**: Applied before tribute collection. Tributes do not count toward limit.
- **Priest Collection**: Based on state at Upkeep Phase Step 5. Population/culture changes during Worship Phase do not affect priest count until next Upkeep.
- **Building Costs**: "Wild" symbols (amphora) can be paid with any resource. Multiple amphoras can be different types.
- **Temple of Hephaestus**: Allows spending 1 VP instead of 1 resource per building. Cannot be used for itself. Optional.
- **Trispastos**: Grants two free buildings (culture 1). If only one missing, build that one. If all built, no effect.
- **Acropolis**: Grants β favor of deity with fewest worshippers. If you have Temple of Zeus/Hera, you get their α favor instead.
- **War Declaration**: Target declared only after all favors from current deity are resolved.
- **Plague Protection**: Only from worshipping Apollo that round. Not permanent.
- **Temple of Apollo**: Grants permanent plague immunity.
