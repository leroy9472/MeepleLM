# Timbuktu – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Timbuktu is a legendary city at the edge of the Sahara, a destination for caravans carrying valuable goods. Players lead caravans across oases, aiming to deliver goods safely to Timbuktu. However, thieves lurk in every oasis, threatening to steal cargo. The objective is to transport the most valuable goods to Timbuktu by skillfully interpreting limited information about upcoming thefts and navigating the caravan route wisely.

### 2. Components
- **1 gameboard (4 pieces)**:  
  - Starting Board (with starting pens and first oasis)  
  - Destination Board (Timbuktu and penultimate oasis)  
  - 2 small oasis boards (each showing one oasis)  
- **105 goods tokens**: 21 each in 5 categories: Gold, Coffee, Pepper, Salt, Water  
- **5 caravan boards**: One per player, each showing 8 camels (A–H) with pre-printed goods on one side; blank on reverse  
- **40 camel cards**: 8 per player, one for each camel (A–H)  
- **15 thief cards**: Divided into 3 categories:  
  - Pen (indicates which pen is targeted)  
  - Pitch (indicates which pitch number is targeted)  
  - Goods (indicates which goods are stolen)  
- **1 sticker sheet**: For labeling camels, stage/round counters (duplicate stickers for both sides)  
- **40 wooden camels**: Colored to match players’ caravans  
- **1 stage counter**: Indicates starting player for the current stage  
- **1 round counter**: Indicates starting player for the current round  
- **1 rulebook**

### 3. Setup

#### Choose Player Count
- 3 players: Use all 8 camels per player  
- 4 players: Use camels A–F (6 camels)  
- 5 players: Use camels A–E (5 camels)  
Unused camels and corresponding cards are set aside.

#### Prepare Caravans
Each player:
- Takes a caravan board in their color  
- Receives matching colored wooden camels and 8 camel cards  
- Allocates goods to camels based on chosen variant:

**Standard Setup (pre-printed goods):**  
Use the side of the board with pre-printed goods. Assign goods accordingly. Unused camel slots remain empty.

**Variant Setup (custom goods):**  
Use the blank side. Each player receives:
- 5 players: 4 of each good (20 total)  
- 4 players: 5 of each good (25 total) – 1 good left over, removed from game  
- 3 players: 7 of each good (35 total) – 3 goods left over, removed from game  
Each camel carries up to 4 goods. Must carry 3 or 4 different types (no camel may carry only 1 or 2 types).

#### Set Up Game Board
- Assemble the 4 board sections in order: Start → Oasis 1 → (Oasis 2) → (Oasis 3) → Timbuktu  
- 3 players: Remove both small oasis boards  
- 4 players: Remove one small oasis board  
- 5 players: Use all boards  
Unused oases can be stored and added later if needed.

#### Place Camels
- Starting player places first camel on any free starting pitch.  
- Players take turns placing one camel at a time clockwise.  
- At the end of setup, each pen must contain at least one camel from every player.  
- Order within pens does not matter.

#### Prepare Counters
- Oldest player becomes starting player, takes both stage and round counters.  
- Each player gets paper and pencil to track thief card info.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in **stages**, each representing travel from one oasis to the next. A stage consists of:
1. Dealing thief cards  
2. Moving camels (via rounds)  
3. Resolving thefts  
This repeats until all camels reach Timbuktu.

#### Stage Structure
- Each stage ends when all camels have moved to the next oasis.  
- After thefts, if Timbuktu has not been reached, begin a new stage.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Dealing the Thief Cards
- Starting player separates thief cards into 3 face-down piles by category (Pen, Pitch, Goods), shuffles each.  
- Deals 5 piles of 3 cards each (1 from each category).  
Distribution:
- 5 players: Each player takes 1 pile (kept hidden)  
- 4 players: 4 piles to players, 1 leftover pile placed between starting player and right neighbor  
- 3 players: 3 piles to players, 2 leftover piles placed between starting player and each neighbor (left and right)  
Each player now has one piece of information about the upcoming theft. Players should note this secretly.

#### Moving the Camels (Rounds)
- Game proceeds in **rounds**, clockwise.  
- Each round:  
  1. **Choose camel card**: All players simultaneously select one camel card and place it face down.  
  2. **Reveal and move**: Starting with the round leader, players reveal cards in clockwise order and move the corresponding camel.  
- A camel moves to any pen at the next oasis.  
- **Movement rules**:  
  - Moving in the direction of the two green arrows (indicated on board): **Free**  
  - Moving to any of the other three pens: **Pay 1 carried good** as toll (place beside board)  
    - If camel carries no goods, it may still move (no toll paid)  
    - Toll is paid regardless of whether move is voluntary or forced (e.g., due to full pens)  
- **Only 1 camel per pitch**; camels must occupy the lowest-numbered free pitch in a pen.

#### Swap Fields
- If a camel lands on a **swap field (pitch marked as such)**:  
  - All players pass their pile of thief cards **to the left**  
  - Leftover piles (between players in 3–4 player games) also shift clockwise  
  - Players review new information and update notes

#### End of Round
- After all players have moved, the round ends.  
- Round counter passes to the left. That player becomes starting player for next round.  
- Repeat rounds until all camels have moved to the next oasis.

#### Thefts
- After all camels are placed, resolve thefts:  
  - Reveal all 5 piles of thief cards one by one  
  - Each pile specifies:  
    - Pen (from Pen card)  
    - Pitch (from Pitch card)  
    - Goods (from Goods card)  
  - Steal **all** specified goods from **any camel** on the matching pen and pitch  
    - If camel has the goods, all are stolen  
    - If camel lacks the goods, nothing is taken  
  - Stolen goods are placed face-up near the board, sorted by type  
- The more of a good type that are stolen (or used as toll), the more valuable the remaining ones become at scoring

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends when **all camels reach Timbuktu** and the **final theft** is resolved.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - Each good that reaches Timbuktu is worth **1 point per total number of that type removed from the game**  
    - Includes goods stolen **and** used as tolls during movement  
  - Example: If 12 Coffee tokens were removed (stolen or paid), each Coffee that reaches Timbuktu is worth 12 points  
- Total each player’s points from all goods delivered  
- **Winning**:  
  - Highest score wins  
  - Tiebreaker 1: Player with more individual goods delivered wins  
  - Tiebreaker 2: Shared victory
