## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Nine hundred years after a royal dynasty fell and demons stole five ancient Artifacts, a prophecy foretells that a hero of royal blood will rise to reclaim them and restore peace. Each player takes on the role of a unique hero journeying across a land of chaos to grow stronger, gain powerful items and abilities, and ultimately claim four of the five Artifacts to ascend the throne.  

If all five Artifacts are taken but no player holds four, a Final Battle begins among those who possess at least one Artifact. The first to win four Artifacts becomes king and wins the game.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Strength, Health, Willpower, Magic  
- **Health = Strength:** Red cubes on right side. Losing Health moves cubes left, reducing Strength.  
- **Magic = Willpower:** Blue cubes on right side. Using Magic moves cubes left, reducing Willpower.  
- Permanent increases: Add cubes from bank (max 8 Strength, 10 Willpower). Excess becomes healing/recharge.  

#### Combat  
- **Battle of Strength:** Use Strength + bonuses vs. creature’s Strength.  
- **Battle of Wills:** Use Willpower + bonuses vs. creature’s Willpower.  
  - Initiator pays 2 Magic (or 2 + # Artifacts when attacking a player).  
  - Always takes precedence if available.  

- **Rolling:**  
  - Lighter die: character  
  - Darker die: opponent  
  - Add characteristic and bonuses. Higher total wins. Tie = draw.  

- **Creature Types:**  
  - Only Strength: Battle of Strength mandatory.  
  - Only Willpower: Battle of Wills mandatory (no cost to player).  
  - Strength then Willpower: Creature attacks with Strength; player may pay 2 Magic to initiate Battle of Wills.  
  - Willpower then Strength or special rules: follow card text (denoted by ● or ?).  

- **Multiple Lives (●):**  
  - Must win 3 consecutive rolls.  
  - One loss/draw = lose entire battle.  
  - Type of battle and equipment fixed for all rolls.  
  - Initiation cost paid once.  

- **Weapons & Equipment:**  
  - Max 2 handheld items (1 weapon, 1 shield or non-weapon).  
  - Two-handed weapon = no shield or second item.  
  - One head item only.  
  - Bonuses only count for used items.  
  - Thrown weapons: bonus applies to one roll only, then becomes damaged.  

- **Spells & Abilities:**  
  - Spells cost Magic to activate.  
  - Some Abilities are passive; others must be announced before battle.  
  - Once-per-round effects (e.g., Counterfeiting, Time Loop) apply even with multiple turns.  
  - Non-battle effects (e.g., potions) can only be used before or between battles, not during.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Event Cards:** Draw after all other actions, based on space type. Civilization Events have Settlement/Guild subtypes.  
- **Haggling:** Items costing 1–2 Gold are free when buying/selling.  
- **Turn Back Time:** Re-rolls dice; all bonuses remain. Not a new battle.  
- **Scroll of Altered Reality:** Re-rolls one die in multi-die situations.  
- **Vampire:** Must win Battle of Wills, then Battle of Strength. Counts as one battle; no equipment change.  
- **Multiple Dice Effects (e.g., Prayer vs. Curse):**  
  - Difference in dice rolled applies to disadvantaged player.  
  - Example: Prayer (roll 2, keep best) vs. Curse (roll 2, keep worst) → difference of 1 → affected player rolls 2 dice, keeps worst.  
- **Trading:** Allowed only in same space, instead of moving. Only Gold and Items. Must be mutually beneficial.  
- **No Final Battle Variant:** Win by collecting 2 Artifacts.  
- **Apocalypse Variant:** When fifth Artifact is taken, reshuffle all Chance cards. If deck runs out, begin Apocalypse: each round, all players lose 1 Health and 1 Magic at start. Ends when someone wins or all are eliminated.
