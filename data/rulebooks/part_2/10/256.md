## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the role of steamboat captains racing down the Mississippi River to claim the title of "Queen of the Mississippi." Success isn't just about speed—revenue from passengers is crucial. The goal is to be the first to dock at the landing platform with exactly two passengers on board. Movement, coal management, and strategic tile placement shape a dynamic river journey.

### 2. Components  
- 12 River Tiles  
- 1 Starting Tile (with numbered starting spaces)  
- 1 Landing Platform Tile  
- 5 Steamboats (in different colors)  
- 10 Wheels: 5 red (speed), 5 black (coal)  
- 16 Passengers (in matching colors)  
- 1 Direction Die (with Left, Straight, Right)  
- 1 Measuring Rule (for determining position)  
- Optional: Black Rose steamboat (6th boat)

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player selects a steamboat and receives one red (speed) and one black (coal) wheel.  
   - Set speed (red wheel) to 1.  
   - Set coal (black wheel) to 6.  
2. Place the Starting Tile at one end of the table.  
3. Randomly draw one river tile and place it straight ahead (middle connector) of the Starting Tile.  
4. Players place their steamboats on the numbered starting spaces in clockwise order:  
   - 3 players: spaces 1, 2, 3  
   - 4 players: spaces 1, 2, 3, 4  
   - 5 players: spaces 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  
   - 6 players: 5th player on space 5, 6th behind space 3 (gets 1 free coal on first turn only)  
5. In variants with the Black Rose, it occupies the last available starting space.  

For 2-player game with Black Rose:  
- Player 1: boats on spaces 1 and 4  
- Player 2: boats on spaces 2 and 3  
- Each player controls two boats.  

For Branching River Variant (6–8 players):  
- Place Starting Tile.  
- Attach one tile to left and one to right of start tile.  
- Extend each branch with a straight tile.  
- Rejoin branches with a Re-Joining Tile placed beneath both branches.  
- Players place boats anywhere on the Starting Tile.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Turn order is determined at the start of each turn, from first to last:  
1. Furthest downstream (farthest tile from start).  
2. If tied, furthest from trailing edge of next tile.  
3. If still tied:  
   a. Highest speed  
   b. Most coal  
   c. Rightmost boat (looking downstream)  

Each player, in turn, performs the following actions in sequence:

#### A. Adjust Speed  
- Change speed by ±1 for free.  
- For changes greater than ±1, spend 1 coal per additional notch (e.g., from 2 to 4 costs 1 coal).  
- Must adjust speed **before** movement.

#### B. Movement  
- Move a number of spaces equal to current speed.  
- All movement must be forward (in direction of bow).  
- May make **one free 60° turn** (left or right) during movement.  
- Additional 60° turns cost 1 coal each.  
- Cannot move onto land or off the edge of a tile.  
- If unable to complete movement without crashing, the boat is out of the game.

#### C. Pushing  
- May push another boat by moving into its space.  
- Costs 1 extra movement point (you move one less space).  
- Pushed boat may be placed in any adjacent legal space (open water, station, sandbar, logs), except:  
  - Land  
  - A space already passed through this turn  
  - Another occupied boat  
- Owner of pushed boat chooses its new facing, **unless** pushed onto:  
  - Sandbar: facing remains unchanged  
  - Floating logs: facing remains unchanged  
- Can push multiple boats if enough movement points.  
- Cannot push a boat already on a sandbar.

#### D. Tile Placement  
- If a player ends movement on the furthest-downstream tile:  
  - Roll direction die and place a new river tile in that direction.  
  - If placement would create a loop, re-roll.  
  - If this is the last river tile, roll again to place the Landing Platform.  
- When a new tile contains a passenger station (island with hut), place passengers:  
  - 3 players: 1 passenger per station  
  - 4 players: 1 on red stations, 2 on brown stations  
  - 5+ players: 2 passengers per station  
- When all players have passed a tile, it may be removed. Any remaining passengers return to the box.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Passengers  
- Can only pick up a passenger by ending movement on a station space **at speed 1**.  
- Each boat may carry up to **2 passengers total**.  
- Only **1 passenger per station** per boat.  
- If pushed onto a station at speed 1, may collect a passenger (if not already taken from that station).  
- Cannot pick up passenger and finish the race on the same turn—even if station is on final tile.

#### Coal & Stations  
- **Coal Supply Stations (black huts):**  
  - Must end movement at speed 1.  
  - Refill coal to maximum (6).  
- Running out of coal: remove black wheel.  
- If movement requires coal (e.g., turning) but none remains, boat crashes and is eliminated.

#### Special Tiles  
- **Sandbars:**  
  - Movement ends immediately.  
  - Set speed to 1.  
  - Cannot turn on sandbar.  
  - Next turn:  
    - Move forward: costs 1 coal  
    - Move backward: free, then choose new facing  
  - Cannot be pushed while on sandbar.  
  - If pushed onto sandbar, no facing change allowed.  

- **Floating Logs:**  
  - Costs **2 movement points** to enter or pass through.  
  - At end of movement, reduce speed by 1 for each log space entered.  
  - Pushing into logs:  
    - Pusher pays extra movement point  
    - Pushed boat does not reduce speed  
    - No facing change for pushed boat  

#### The Black Rose (Variant)  
- Controlled by the player who moves **last** each turn.  
- Starts in last available starting space.  
- Movement rules:  
  - Speed and coal adjusted normally  
  - May spend up to **1 coal per turn** (supply is unlimited)  
- Can exchange **up to 2 coal** with another boat controlled by same player if:  
  - Adjacent  
  - Same speed  
  - Both in open water (not on station, sandbar, logs, etc.)  
- May stop at stations but **cannot stay**—must leave next turn.  
- **Never** picks up passengers or coal.  
- **Never** eliminated.  
- No player may create a situation requiring >1 coal for Black Rose’s next move.  
- If tile placement causes such a situation, controlling player may spend only enough coal to extract it.

#### Exchanging Coal (2-player & Black Rose)  
- Two boats (same player) may exchange coal if:  
  - Adjacent at end of turn  
  - Same speed  
  - Both in open water  
- Black Rose limited to transferring **2 coal max** per turn.  
- No exchange allowed on stations, sandbars, logs, landing platform.

#### 2-Player Rules  
- Each player controls two boats.  
- Starting positions:  
  - Player 1: spaces 1 and 4  
  - Player 2: spaces 2 and 3  
- Only 1 passenger per station (8 total).  
- Only one of the two boats needs to finish with 2 passengers.

#### 6-Player Rules  
- 6th player starts behind space 3.  
- Gets 1 free coal on first turn (lost if unused).  
- 2 passengers per station (16 total).  
- 4 passengers may be left uncollected if all boats are to succeed.

#### 7–8 Player Variant  
- 6th, 7th, 8th players start behind spaces 3, 2, 1 respectively.  
- Each gets 1 free coal on first turn.  
- 2 passengers per island, **2 per coal station** (20 total).  
- Coal refill and passenger pickup allowed on same turn at coal stations.  
- No Black Rose in 8-player game.

#### Variants  
- **Branching River (6–8 players):**  
  - Start with two river branches rejoining later.  
  - Prevents early-game logjams.  
- **No Pushing Near Finish ("Spectators" Rule):**  
  - No pushing allowed in final three hexes or one space before them.  
- **Tile Selection by Vote:**  
  - Replace die roll with voting using Left/Straight/Right cards.  
  - Majority wins; tie broken by player on lead boat.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends immediately when a player **docks at one of the three middle spaces** in front of the landing platform **with exactly 2 passengers**.  
- Docking requires **ending movement at speed 1**.  
- Being **pushed** onto a final space at speed 1 counts as docking.  
- Winner is first to meet these conditions.  
- Other players do not continue—game ends instantly.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you pick up a passenger and finish on the same turn?**  
  No. Must end turn on station to pick up passenger. Finish must occur on a subsequent turn.

- **Can you adjust speed after moving?**  
  No. Speed must be set **before** movement begins.

- **Can you move backward normally?**  
  Only when on a sandbar. Otherwise, all movement is forward.

- **What happens if you can’t place a tile due to loop?**  
  Re-roll until a non-looping direction is chosen.

- **Can the Black Rose crash?**  
  No. Players must avoid creating situations where it would require >1 coal to escape. If a tile causes such a situation, the controller may spend only what’s needed to extract it.

- **Can you push a boat off the river?**  
  No. Pushed boat must go to a legal, unoccupied, non-land space.

- **Do floating logs reduce speed during movement?**  
  No. Speed reduction happens **after** movement is complete.
