### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A game is played in rounds. Each round consists of the following steps:

1. **Draw & Arrange Categories**  
   - At the start of each round, all teams draw 4 category tiles from the bag.  
   - Arrange them on your tile board in the order you wish to answer.

2. **Answer Questions in Order**  
   - Begin with the lowest-point-value (fewest dots) category.  
   - Teams take turns clockwise answering one question per turn.  
   - The team to the **left** of the answering team draws a question card from the correct category and reads the question aloud.  
   - After the question is answered (correctly or incorrectly), return the question card to the **back of the box**.  
   - Turn the used category tile **face down** on your tile board.  

3. **Movement**  
   - A **correct answer** allows the team to move their playing piece **clockwise** around the board by a number of spaces equal to the **dot value** (1, 2, or 3) of the category tile.  
   - Incorrect answers result in **no movement**.

4. **Special Tile Use (BEZZERWIZZER® and ZWAP)**  
   - Each team may use up to:  
     - 2 BEZZERWIZZER® tiles  
     - 1 ZWAP tile  
     …per round.  
   - **BEZZERWIZZER® Tile**:  
     - Can be played **before** an opponent’s question is read.  
     - If you are reading the question to another team, you must play it **before** looking at the card.  
     - After the question is read, the **opponent answers first**.  
     - If they answer **incorrectly** and you answer **correctly**, you earn **3 points** (move 3 spaces).  
     - Only one team may play a BEZZERWIZZER® per question.  
   - **ZWAP Tile**:  
     - Can be played at the **beginning of your turn**, **before** the question is read.  
     - Allows you to **swap one of your face-up category tiles** with one of an opponent’s face-up tiles.  
     - Useful for removing a difficult category from your lineup.  

5. **Tile Resolution & End of Turn**  
   - After playing a BEZZERWIZZER® or ZWAP tile, turn it **face down** and set it aside.  
   - It cannot be used again until the **next round**.

6. **End of Round**  
   - The round ends when all teams have answered (or attempted) all 4 of their category questions.  
   - Return all used category tiles to the bag.  
   - All teams **retrieve** their BEZZERWIZZER® and ZWAP tiles for use in the next round.  
   - The **first-player token** passes clockwise to the next team.  
   - Begin a new round: draw 4 new category tiles, arrange, and play.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Turn Order**: Clockwise; determined per round, rotating starting player.  
- **Question Reading**: Always done by the team to the **left** of the answering team.  
- **Tile Use Timing**:  
  - ZWAP: Beginning of your turn, before question is read.  
  - BEZZERWIZZER®: Before opponent’s question is read (or before you look at the card if you’re the reader).  
- **Movement**: Only for correct answers; value = number of dots on the category tile.  
- **Tile States**:  
  - Category tiles are turned face down after use.  
  - Special tiles (BEZZERWIZZER®, ZWAP) are set aside after use and returned at round end.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Winning Condition**:  
  - The first team to **circle the board and return to the Start Square** wins — **but only if all teams have answered the same number of questions**.  
- **Tiebreaker (Multiple Teams Reach Start)**:  
  - All teams that reached Start draw **one new category tile**.  
  - Each selects a question from that category.  
  - Teams answer one at a time (order determined by proximity or mutual agreement).  
  - If only **one team answers correctly**, they win.  
  - If multiple teams are still tied, repeat the tiebreaker until only one team answers correctly.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use a BEZZERWIZZER® on my own team?**  
  No. BEZZERWIZZER® is used to steal an opponent’s question.  
- **Can I use ZWAP after seeing the question?**  
  No. ZWAP must be played **before** the question is read.  
- **Can I use BEZZERWIZZER® if I’m reading the question?**  
  Yes, but you must play it **before** looking at the question card.  
- **What if the bag runs out of category tiles mid-round?**  
  The rules assume 20 tiles are sufficient for 4 tiles per team per round. With 2–4 teams, reshuffling at round end ensures availability.  
- **Can I use both BEZZERWIZZER® tiles on the same question?**  
  No. Only one BEZZERWIZZER® may be played per question, and only one per team per round unless otherwise specified.  
- **Do I have to answer if a BEZZERWIZZER® is played on my question?**  
  Yes. The original team must answer first. The BEZZERWIZZER®-playing team may attempt to steal only if the original answer is wrong.
