## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Capitol is a strategic card and block game where players act as architects building structures across a city divided into nine distinct areas. Over four rounds, players construct buildings in their personal supply, place them on the board, and compete in auctions to place public monuments. The goal is to earn the most points through strategic placement, dominance in areas, and effective use of monuments.

2. Components  
- Roof Cards (2 per player)  
- Floor Cards (4 per player)  
- Permit Cards (2 per player)  
- Stop Card (1 per player)  
- Roof Blocks in player colors (exact count not specified, but enough for 4 buildings)  
- Floor Blocks (6 per player)  
- Fountains, Amphitheaters, Temples (public monuments)  
- Game Board with 9 areas (3 colors, 3 areas each), each containing 1 large space and multiple small spaces  

3. Setup  
1. Deal to each player:  
   - 2 Roof Cards  
   - 2 Floor Cards  
   - 4 Permit Cards  
   - 1 Stop Card  
2. Place each card type in a separate face-up stack near the board.  
3. Each player takes:  
   - All Roof Blocks of one color  
   - 6 Floor Blocks  
   - Build 4 personal buildings:  
     - Two 1-story buildings (1 floor + roof)  
     - Two 2-story buildings (2 floors + roof)  
   - Place rounded roofs on one 1-story and one 2-story building  
   - Place triangular roofs on the other two  
4. Place the starting monuments:  
   - Fountains, amphitheaters, and temples on matching spaces at the side of the board  
5. Choose starting player and give them the First Player Marker.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game consists of 4 rounds. Each round follows this sequence:

**Phase 1: Construction**  
Starting with the First Player and proceeding clockwise, each player takes turns performing one of the following actions:  
a) **Play a Floor Card** – Take 2 floor blocks and add them to incomplete buildings (buildings without roofs). You may begin 1 or 2 new buildings during this action.  
b) **Play a Roof Card** – Place a roof (round or triangular) on any incomplete building, completing it.  
c) **Play a Permit Card** – Place a completed building on the board:  
   - Must be placed on a vacant small space  
   - Must match the color of the Permit Card  
   - Must follow roof type and height rules (see Core Mechanics)  
d) **Pass** – End your participation in this phase.  

Once a player passes, they cannot act again until the next round. Players may play a card without performing its associated action. Continue until all players have passed. Card numbers are ignored in this phase.

**Phase 2: Improvement/Auction**  
Three auctions are held in this order:  
a) **Auction a Fountain** – Winner places it on any vacant small space.  
b) **Auction a Second Fountain** – Same as above; multiple fountains allowed per area.  
c) **Round 1 & 2: Auction an Amphitheater** – Winner places it on any vacant large space.  
   **Round 3 & 4: Auction a Temple** – Winner places it on any vacant large space.  

Auction Rules:  
- Players create a face-down stack from their hand.  
- Cards above the Stop Card are bid; cards below are retained.  
- All players reveal cards one at a time until Stop Card is revealed.  
- Bid value = sum of cards revealed before Stop Card.  
- Highest bid wins.  
- Tiebreakers:  
  1. Highest single card in the bid  
  2. If still tied, player closest to First Player clockwise wins  
- Winner discards all bid cards. Others keep theirs.  
- If no one bids (Stop Card on top), the item is removed from auction.

**Phase 3: Scoring**  
Score each of the 9 areas:  
- **1st Place**: Most floors → 2 points + 1 point per Fountain in the area  
- **2nd Place**: Second-most floors → 1 point per Fountain in the area  
- Tie for 1st in floors:  
  - If tied players have different building heights, tallest building wins 1st place; others get 2nd  
  - If tied in both floors and height, all tied players get 1st place; no 2nd place awarded  
- Tie for 2nd (only one 1st place): All tied for 2nd receive 2nd place points  
- Areas with a **Temple**: All scores are doubled  
- Only number of floors matters — not number of buildings

**Phase 4: End of Round**  
1. Starting with First Player, each player draws 6 cards (recommended variant: draw 1 at a time in turn order).  
2. Players with most floors in areas with **Amphitheaters** draw 2 bonus cards  
3. Players with second-most floors in such areas draw 1 bonus card  
4. Pass First Player Marker to the left  
5. Begin next round unless 4 rounds completed

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Floors**: Can only be added, never removed or moved  
- **Roofs**: Once placed, cannot be removed. Completes a building  
- **Building Placement (Permit Card)**:  
  - Must be on a vacant small space  
  - Must match Permit Card color  
  - Roof Type Rules:  
    - First building in an area may have any roof type  
    - All subsequent buildings must match the first’s roof type  
    - No area may contain both roof types  
  - Height Rules:  
    - First building must have exactly 1 floor  
    - Subsequent buildings must be same height as tallest, or exactly 1 floor taller  
  - Roof Mix Restriction:  
    - Across the 3 areas of the same color, not all may have the same roof type  
    - E.g., all 3 Blue areas cannot all have round roofs  
- **Auction Bidding**:  
  - Only card numbers matter  
  - Stop Card separates bid from non-bid cards  
  - Bids revealed sequentially until Stop Card

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Score each area after every round (4 total scoring phases)  
- Final score = sum of all 4 rounds  
- Highest total score wins  
- Tiebreakers not specified in source

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a card without using its action?** Yes.  
- **Can I change building configuration after placing floors?** No. Once you declare satisfaction after a Floor action, placement is final.  
- **Can a building have more than one roof?** No. Only one roof per building.  
- **Can I place a building on a large space?** No. Only monuments (Amphitheaters, Temples) go on large spaces.  
- **Can I place multiple buildings in one area?** Yes, as long as height and roof rules are followed.  
- **Can I have both a Temple and Amphitheater in the same area?** Yes, but only one can occupy the large space at a time.  
- **Do Fountains block building placement?** Yes. Fountains occupy small spaces; buildings cannot be placed there.  
- **What happens if all small spaces in an area are full?** No more buildings or fountains can be placed there.  
- **Can I bid zero?** Yes, by placing Stop Card on top. This removes the item from auction if all pass.
