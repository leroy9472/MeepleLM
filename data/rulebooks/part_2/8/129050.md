## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
- The game is a deduction challenge in which players take on the role of private investigators solving cases.  
- **Objective**: Score the most points by correctly solving three cases. Each correct solution earns points; incorrect guesses result in point penalties.

2. Components  
- Suspect cards  
- Crime cards  
- Location cards  
- Evidence cards  
- Suspect and Crime tiles  
- Investigators (5 per player, single-use across game)  
- Discs and Cubes (used for clue feedback)  
- Case tile and Penalty tile for each player  
- Scoring track  

3. Setup  
- Each player is dealt one Suspect, one Crime, and one Location card. This forms the case that the player to their **left** must solve.  
- Randomly place the Suspect and Crime tiles on the board.  
- Shuffle the Evidence deck and place 9 cards face-up in the Evidence area.  
- Each player starts with 5 Investigators (used over the course of 3 cases).

4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of three cases. For each case:  
1. Deal new case cards (Suspect, Crime, Location) to each player.  
2. Set up board tiles and Evidence cards.  
3. Players take turns clockwise.  
4. On your turn, choose one of the following actions:  

   A) **Place an Investigator in a Location**  
   - Spend one of your 5 Investigators to place in any Location.  
   - The player on your right (who holds your case) responds:  
     - Places a **Disc** if any case element (Suspect, Crime, Location) is in that Location.  
     - Places a **Cube** if any case element is in an **adjacent** Location.  
     - Does not reveal which element is indicated.  

   B) **Select an Evidence Card**  
   - Choose one face-up Evidence card.  
   - Assign it to a Location.  
   - The player on your right responds:  
     - Places a **Disc** on the element (Suspect, Crime, or Location) if it matches the case and is in the assigned Location.  
     - Places a **Cube** on the element if it matches the case and is in an adjacent Location.  
     - If no Disc or Cube is placed, you **keep the card** as proof that the element has been ruled out.  
   - Restock the face-up Evidence cards to 9.  

   C) **Attempt to Solve Your Case**  
   - Use the three black discs to indicate your guess: one for Suspect, one for Crime, one for Location.  
   - The player on your right verifies the solution:  
     - **Correct**: Move your **Case tile** forward on the scoring track (one box per case solved).  
     - **Incorrect**: Move your **Penalty tile** down one space (point loss).  
   - You may attempt a solution only once per turn.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Hidden Information**: Each player holds the solution to the case the player on their left is solving.  
- **Deduction**: Use Discs and Cubes from actions to infer which elements are part of your case.  
- **Resource Management**: 5 Investigators total per player (shared across 3 cases).  
- **Evidence Tracking**: Keeping a card means that element is not in your case (if no clue was given).  
- **Board Layout**: Adjacency matters for Cube placement during clue responses.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends after **three cases**.  
- Final score =  
  - 1 point per case solved (via Case tile position on track)  
  - Minus 1 point per space your Penalty tile is below start  
- **Highest score wins**.  
- **Special Rule – Misinformation Penalty**:  
  - If a player gives **incorrect clue information** (e.g., wrong Disc/Cube placement), they receive **0 points** for that case.  
  - The misled player receives **7 points** as compensation.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I attempt to solve more than once?**  
  Yes, but each attempt costs a turn and risks a penalty if wrong.  
- **What happens when I run out of Investigators?**  
  You can no longer perform Action A (Place Investigator), but can still use Evidence cards or attempt solutions.  
- **Do I return kept Evidence cards between cases?**  
  Yes, all cards are reshuffled and reused for each new case.  
- **What if multiple elements are in the same or adjacent Location?**  
  The clue-giver still places only one Disc or Cube (never multiple), and does not specify which element it refers to.  
- **Can I look at the case cards I hold for others?**  
  Yes, you may review the cards you were dealt at any time—they represent the solution for the player on your left.
