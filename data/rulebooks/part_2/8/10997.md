## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the roles of prospectors in the Wild West, competing to amass the most wealth during the gold rush. Victory is determined by combining three sources of wealth:  
- Gold chips collected during play  
- Production value of all owned mines  
- Bonuses for serving as mayor in towns  

The player with the highest total score at the end of the game wins.  

### 2. Components  
- **Poker chips**: Represent gold (white = 1, red = 5, blue = 10)  
- **Draw deck**: Contains mining concession cards and event cards  
- **Mining concession cards**: Represent individual mines; include production die, production value, town name, and town color border  
- **Event cards**: Provide one-time, ongoing, or delayed effects  
- **Two six-sided dice**: Used for production rolls and certain event card effects  
- **Town tokens**: Wooden tokens representing towns (Cactus Junction, Cold Mountain, Coyote City, Dry Gulch, San Narciso)  
- **Mayor pawns**: Colored pawns (green, purple, red, yellow, blue) indicating mayoral control  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Starting Gold**: Each player receives 10 gold in chips (e.g., one blue chip or equivalent).  
2. **Draw Deck**: Shuffle all cards face down to form the draw deck.  
   - In a 3-player game: Remove 15 random cards from the deck without looking and set them aside.  
3. **Shared Components**: Place the two dice, bank supply of poker chips, town tokens, and mayor pawns near the draw deck.  
4. **First Player**: Randomly determine the starting player.  
   - Subsequent first players are the winner of the previous turn’s auction.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn proceeds in the following phases:  

#### Phase 1: Reveal Cards  
- Draw as many cards face up as there are players.  
- **First turn only**: All revealed cards must be mining concession cards.  
  - If non-mine cards are drawn, return them to the deck, draw replacements, then reshuffle.  

#### Phase 2: Auction (Bidding)  
- Bidding begins with the current first player and proceeds clockwise.  
- Players may:  
  - Pass (and exit the auction)  
  - Bid 1 or more gold (must have sufficient funds)  
- Bidding continues until only one player remains.  
- **All pass rule**: If all players pass, the first player to pass is considered the highest bidder.  

#### Phase 3: Paying for the Bid  
**4 or 5 players**:  
- Highest bidder pays full amount to the player on their right.  
- That player keeps half (rounded up), passes the remainder to the next player on the right.  
- This continues around the circle.  
- **Important**: The highest bidder never receives any money back.  
  - If the bidder’s left neighbor receives 2 or more gold, that neighbor keeps all of it (no further passing).  

**3 players**:  
- Same as above, but the third player keeps half (rounded up) and returns the rest to the **bank**, not to the first player.  

#### Phase 4: Card Selection  
- Highest bidder chooses one of the revealed cards:  
  - **Mining concession**: Place face up in front of them, grouped by town color.  
  - **Event card**: Follow its type (immediate, place beside mine, or keep).  
- Then, starting with the player to the left of the highest bidder, each player selects one remaining card in **leftward order** until all have one.  
- **Mayor Fee**: If a player takes a mine in a town with a mayor, they must pay the mayor an amount equal to the number of mines the mayor owns in that town.  

#### Phase 5: Production  
- The first player rolls both dice.  
- Any mine whose **production die** matches **either** die result produces gold equal to its **production value**.  
- **Dangerous mines** (marked in red text): Collapse and are removed from the game if the dice roll is **2 or 12** (regardless of match).  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Mayors  
- A player becomes mayor of a town when they are the **first to own 2 mines** in that town.  
  - They take the corresponding mayor pawn (color-matched to town).  
- **Mayor benefits**: Any player taking a mine in that town must pay the mayor a fee equal to the number of mines the mayor owns in that town.  
- **Mayor change**: If a player owns more mines in a town than the current mayor, they become the new mayor.  
  - They take the mayor pawn.  
  - **Important**: If the change happens during card selection, the player must **first pay the former mayor** before claiming the pawn.  

#### Event Cards  
**Immediate Effect (play and discard)**:  
- **Card Shark**: All other players pay 4 gold to the bank.  
- **Dynamite**: Destroy an opponent’s mine or saloon of your choice.  
- **Expropriation**: Take any one mine from another player, but only in a town where you already own a mine. Normal mayor fees apply if the town has a mayor.  
- **Holdup**: Choose a player and a target number (2–12). Roll both dice: if the sum is equal to or greater than the target, steal that amount from the player. If not, no effect.  
- **Stagecoach Robbery**: Gain 10 gold from the bank.  

**Place Next to Mine (lasting effect)**:  
- **Governor**: Place one of your mayor pawns on this card. While active, fees paid to you in that town are **doubled**. Discard if another player takes control of the pawn.  
- **New Vein**: Attach under one mine. Increases its production value by 3. Lost if mine is destroyed or taken. Discarded if attached to a dangerous mine that collapses.  
- **Saloon**: Place in front of you with a town token. Each time a mine in that town produces, its owner pays you 2 gold.  
- **Saloon Girls**: Attach to one of your saloons. Increases saloon fee to 4 gold per production. Discarded if the saloon is destroyed.  

**Kept by Player (usable later, then discard)**:  
- **Mustang**: Use at the start of any card selection phase. Allows you to choose your card **immediately after the first player**, skipping normal turn order.  
- **Telegraph**: After any production dice roll, change one die to any value of your choice.  

#### Bankruptcy  
- If a player cannot fully pay a required amount, they pay all they can.  
- The recipient receives no compensation for unpaid amounts.  
- A player with 0 gold is bankrupt: they cannot bid in auctions until they acquire more gold.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when the **draw deck is exhausted**.  
- After the final production roll, players calculate their total score:  
  - **Gold chips** currently held  
  - **Production value** of all owned mines (sum of printed values)  
  - **+5 gold** for each mayor pawn controlled  
- The player with the **highest total score** wins.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q**: What if the draw deck runs out during a turn?  
  **A**: Complete the current turn. The game ends after the final production roll of that turn.  

- **Q**: Can a player use a "kept" event card at any time?  
  **A**: Yes, but only during appropriate phases (e.g., Telegraph after a dice roll, Mustang during card selection).  

- **Q**: Can you become mayor during the same turn you pay the fee?  
  **A**: Yes, but you must pay the former mayor **before** taking the mayor pawn.  

- **Q**: Do Saloon and Saloon Girls affect the owner’s own mines?  
  **A**: Yes. When your own mine in the saloon’s town produces, you pay yourself (no net change).  

- **Q**: Can you use Expropriation on a mine in a town where you have only event cards (no mine)?  
  **A**: No. You must own a mining concession (mine card) in that town.  

- **Q**: Does New Vein affect production die or only value?  
  **A**: Only increases production **value** by 3. Die requirements remain unchanged.  

- **Q**: Can Governor be used on a mayor pawn you don’t currently control?  
  **A**: No. You must own the mayor pawn to place it on Governor.
