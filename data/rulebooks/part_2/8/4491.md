## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Cave Troll*, players control a team of adventurers and monsters, vying to dominate rooms in the cave troll’s lair to collect gold. The objective is to amass the most gold by controlling rooms during scoring phases and leveraging artifact bonuses.

The game ends when a player plays their final card. A final scoring occurs, and the player with the most gold wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise.  
- **First Round Rule**:
  - Round 1: First player takes 1 action.
  - Round 2: Second player takes up to 2 actions.
  - Round 3: Third player takes up to 3 actions.
  - From Round 4 onward: All players take up to 4 actions per turn.

On your turn, perform up to 4 actions in any order. Each action is one of the following:

#### 1. Draw and Play a Card  
- Draw the top card of your deck into your hand.  
- Play one card from your hand (can be the drawn card or a held card).  
- Resolve the card effect:

| Card Type | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Hero** | Place the corresponding figure in your entrance area. |
| **Monster** | Place the figure in a pit (except Cave Troll – place in any room). |
| **Treasure Chest** | Place the chest in any room (not pit/entrance). Adds +4 gold to the room. Immovable. |
| **Score a Room** | Immediately score one room of your choice. |
| **Find an Artifact** | Draw the top artifact card and keep it hidden. May play it later as an action. |

- If the played card has a **scoring icon** (hourglass), place it in the **scoring pile** (face-up).  
- Cards without scoring icons go to discard pile.

#### 2. Move a Hero or Monster  
- Move one of your figures to an adjacent room (connected by doorway).  
- Movement rules:
  - Max 5 figures per room (exceptions: Wraith, Rampaging Troll).
  - Heroes cannot enter pits.
  - No movement through walls.
  - Cannot enter rooms with Cave Troll or opponent’s Knight (unless you have Knight or Cloak of Invisibility).
  - Wraith may enter a full room if it pushes a hero out.

#### 3. Play an Artifact  
- Use one artifact from your hand. Resolve its effect, then discard it.
- Artifact abilities:
  - **Helm of Mind Control (3g)**: Move one opponent’s figure (not Cave Troll) up to 3 rooms.
  - **Chalice of Teleportation (3g)**: Move all your figures in one room/entrance to any legal rooms.
  - **Idol of El'darr (4g)**: Lock an empty room. Only you score it when board is scored.
  - **Wand of Speed (3g)**: Immediately score one room.
  - **Cloak of Invisibility (2g)**: One hero moves 2 rooms per action this turn and may enter restricted rooms. If in Cave Troll room at turn end, it is discarded.
  - **Sword of Slaying (3g)**: Discard all Orcs in a room with your hero.

#### 4. Use a Hero/Monster Ability (1 Action)  
- **Thief**: Move to any room or entrance.
- **Barbarian**: Counts as 2 heroes during scoring.
- **Knight**: Blocks non-Knight figures from entering its room. Entering room with Orcs discards them.
- **Dwarf**: Doubles the gold value of any room it occupies during full board scoring (does not stack with Treasure).
- **Orc**: Discard one hero in same room.
- **Wraith**: Push one hero from same room to adjacent room (cannot push into full rooms, Cave Troll rooms, or opponent’s Knight rooms).
- **Cave Troll**: Played directly into any room. All other figures in room may be moved out (starting left of player); remainder are discarded. Immovable. Blocks all entry.

> - Berserker, Assassin, Paladin, Giant Slayer (heroes)
> - Rampaging Troll, Grunt, Siren Banshee (monsters)

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Scoring Triggers  
Scoring occurs when **either**:
1. A player plays a **Score a Room** card and chooses one room to score.
2. The **scoring pile** contains **5 or more scoring icons** — triggers full board scoring.

After scoring:
- Scoring pile is removed from game.
- Next scoring icon starts a new pile.

#### Scoring a Room  
- The player with the **most heroes** in a room **controls** it.
- That player gains gold equal to the room’s printed value.
- **Tie** = no one scores.
- **Dwarf effect**: Room’s base value is doubled (per Dwarf present) before control is determined.
- **Treasure Chest**: Adds +4 gold (not doubled by Dwarf).
- **Monster figures** do not contribute to control.

#### Artifact Scoring  
- Unused artifacts at game end grant bonus gold:
  - Helm, Chalice, Wand, Sword: 3g each
  - Cloak: 2g
  - Idol: 4g

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game ends immediately** when a player finishes an action and has **no cards left in their deck**.
- Final actions:
  1. Score the board (full scoring).
  2. The player who ended the game gains **+3 gold**.
  3. All players score unused artifact cards.
- Highest total gold wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a card without drawing first?**  
  No. "Draw and Play a Card" is a single action: draw one, then play one.

- **Can I play an artifact and move in the same turn?**  
  Yes. Each is a separate action.

- **What happens if I play a scoring card and it brings the pile to 5 icons?**  
  Resolve the chosen room immediately. Then, trigger full board scoring.

- **Can a Dwarf double a room with a Treasure Chest?**  
  Yes, but only the base room value. The +4 from Treasure is not doubled.

- **Can I move a figure into a room with 5 figures using Wraith?**  
  Yes, if you push one out during the same move.

- **Can Knight enter room with opponent’s Knight?**  
  Yes. Knights may enter rooms with opposing Knights.

- **What if no rooms can be scored with Score a Room card?**  
  Play the card, place it in scoring pile (adds to count), but no room is scored.

- **Can I use Cloak of Invisibility to move through a Cave Troll room?**  
  You may enter, but if your figure remains there at turn end, it is discarded.

- **Do artifacts stay in play?**  
  No. All are discarded after use. Only unplayed ones count for end-game bonus.
