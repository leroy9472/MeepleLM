## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The Pokémon TCG is a strategic card game where players take on the role of Pokémon Trainers battling with their Pokémon. The objective is to knock out six of the opponent’s Pokémon by reducing their Hit Points to zero (via damage from attacks), thereby claiming six Prize cards, or to deplete the opponent’s deck.

### 2. Components  
- Pokémon, Trainer, and Energy cards  
- Damage counters  
- Special condition markers (Burn, Poison, etc.)  
- Coins or dice for randomization  
- Prize cards (6 in Standard/Constructed, 4 in Limited, 3 in 30-card format)  

### 3. Setup  
- Each player builds a 60-card deck (Standard), 40-card deck (Limited), or 30-card deck (30-card format).  
- Shuffle the deck.  
- Each player draws 7 cards.  
- Place 6 (or 4/3 depending on format) Prize cards face down.  
- Place 1 Basic Pokémon face down as Active; up to 5 more on the Bench.  
- Flip a coin to determine who goes first.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Begin turn.  
2. Draw a card.  
3. Perform actions: play Pokémon, attach Energy, play Trainer cards, retreat, or attack.  
4. Resolve between-turn effects (e.g., Asleep, Burned, Poisoned).  
5. End turn.  
The game proceeds in alternating turns.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Special Conditions  
A Pokémon can only have **one** of the following active at a time: Asleep, Confused, or Paralyzed. The most recently applied condition takes effect. Moving a Pokémon to the Bench removes all special conditions.

- **Asleep**  
  - Rotate Pokémon counterclockwise.  
  - Cannot attack or retreat.  
  - Between turns, flip a coin. On heads, remove Asleep.

- **Burned**  
  - Place Burn Marker.  
  - Between turns, place 2 damage counters, then flip a coin. On heads, remove Burn Marker.  
  - Only one Burn Marker per Pokémon.

- **Confused**  
  - Rotate Pokémon so its head points toward the owner.  
  - Before attacking, flip a coin. On heads, attack normally. On tails, no damage is done; place 3 damage counters on the Pokémon.

- **Paralyzed**  
  - Rotate Pokémon clockwise.  
  - Cannot attack or retreat.  
  - Removed after the owner’s next turn ends.

- **Poisoned**  
  - Place Poison Marker.  
  - Between turns, place 1 damage counter.  
  - Only one Poison Marker per Pokémon.

#### Between-Turn Effects  
After a player’s turn ends and before the next begins:  
- Resolve all between-turn effects (e.g., damage from Burned/Poisoned, coin flips for Asleep/Burned).  
- Apply damage counters and remove conditions as specified.

#### Retreat & Bench Movement  
- Moving a Pokémon from Active to Bench (via retreat or ability) removes all special conditions.  
- Asleep and Paralyzed Pokémon cannot retreat unless an effect (e.g., Trainer card or Ability) allows it.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
A player wins by:  
- Taking their 6th (or 4th/3rd) Prize card.  
- Knocking out the opponent’s Active Pokémon when they have no Benched Pokémon to replace it.  
- Forcing the opponent to draw from an empty deck at the start of their turn.

#### Time Limits & Tiebreakers (Tournament Rules)  
- **Single Game (Constructed)**: 40 minutes + 3 turns.  
- **Best-of-Three**: 75 minutes + 3 turns.  
- If time runs out:  
  - If a clear winner exists (e.g., more Prize cards), they win.  
  - If tied in Prize cards, play continues until one player has fewer Prize cards.  
  - In Best-of-Three, winner of Game 1 wins the match if time expires before Game 2 begins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a Pokémon have multiple conditions?**  
  No. Only one of Asleep, Confused, or Paralyzed can be active. Burned and Poisoned are separate and do not conflict with each other or the others.  
- **What happens when a Confused Pokémon fails the coin flip?**  
  No damage is dealt, and 3 damage counters are placed on the Pokémon.  
- **Can a Paralyzed Pokémon be healed?**  
  Yes, via Trainer cards, Abilities, or moving to the Bench.  
- **Do Burned and Poisoned Pokémon stack damage?**  
  Yes. Between turns, apply 2 damage (Burned) + 1 damage (Poisoned) = 3 damage counters total, then resolve Burned flip.  
- **Can a Pokémon be both Burned and Poisoned?**  
  Yes. They are separate conditions and can coexist.
