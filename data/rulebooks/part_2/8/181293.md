## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Be the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game. VPs are earned throughout the game via actions and scoring cards, and finalized at the end of the game. The player with the highest VP total wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most Credits (¢) in their bank wins. If still tied, the player with the most cards in their Empire wins. If still tied, it is a shared victory.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, perform two steps in order:  
1. Action Step: Take exactly 1 Action.  
2. Draw Step: Discard any number of Resource cards and draw from the Resource deck until you have 3 Resource cards in hand.  
Then pass the turn clockwise.  

Whenever the Resource deck is emptied and must be reshuffled, move the Round marker one space to the right. When the marker reaches '1', the next time the deck is emptied, the game end is triggered.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Assembly Limit**: Unless modified, you may spend a maximum of 2 Resource cards per action.  
- **Resource Cards**: Each has two sections with Resource symbols (Blue/Research, Green/Discovery, Red/Military, Gold/Assets). When used, choose one section. Gold can act as any color when paying for Basic Actions.  
- **Under Construction Area**: Cards placed here await development. Effects are inactive.  
- **Empire**: Cards moved here are active. Choose Logistics (ongoing bonus) or Operational (scoring potential) side when placing.  
- **Basic Actions (7)**:  
  - Buy a Card: Spend 5¢ to draw one card from Ship, Planet, or Tech deck. For each additional 1¢, draw an extra card, choose one to keep, return others to the bottom of the deck.  
  - Discover a Planet: Spend 5 Green Resources +1 per Planet in Empire. Choose to Settle (Logistics) or Exploit (Operational). If Exploit, produce 3 Resources (see Produce).  
  - Develop a Technology: Spend 5 Blue Resources +1 per Tech in Empire. Choose to Deploy (Logistics) or Sell to Corporation (Operational). If Operational, draw a Resource card; if type matches, score immediately.  
  - Build a Ship: Spend 5 Red Resources +1 per Ship in Empire. Choose to Join the Fleet (Logistics) or Go on a Mission (Operational). If Operational, may attack immediately.  
  - Prepare Resources: Choose one row (Ships, Techs, Planets). Attach Resource cards to Under Construction cards. Attached resources count toward cost and do not count against Assembly Limit when completing.  
  - Trade Resources: Choose one Resource color from hand. Discard cards of that color (Gold can be used as any or alone). Gain 1¢ per symbol discarded.  
  - Remove Blockade Tokens: Choose one type (Planets, Techs, Ships). Spend 2 matching Resources (or Gold) to remove 1 token.  

- **Operational Actions (3)**:  
  - Start an Offensive: Spend 5 Red Resources. All Operational Ships may attack one target (Alien System or player). Resolve each Ship’s attack one at a time. Cannot use Gold.  
  - Gain Revenue: Spend 5 Blue Resources. For each Operational Technology, draw a Resource card. If type matches, score the Tech.  
  - Mine the Planets: Spend 5 Green Resources. Each Operational Planet produces 1 Resource (see Produce).  

- **Faction Action**: Unique action listed on your Faction card. May be used multiple times.  
- **Card Actions**: Cards with keyword "ACTION" may be activated instead of your Action.  
- **Additionally**: Use before or after your Action.  
- **Ongoing**: Effect is always active.  
- **Alien Artifacts**: Gained via attack or effects. Played at any time during your turn (not an action). Do not count toward hand limit. Discard after use.  
- **Blockade Tokens**:  
  - Placed on Empire cards (not Under Construction).  
  - Card abilities are inactive unless you pay 1¢ per token to use it.  
  - Removed via Remove Blockade Tokens action (2 Resources per token).  
- **Attacking**:  
  - Choose target: Available Alien System or player.  
  - Draw top Resource card; number is base attack. Add Ship and Tech bonuses.  
  - If Attack Value > 4, treat as 4.  
  - Compare to target’s effect table. Resolve effect.  
  - Each Ship may attack once per turn. Multiple Ships in one action still counts as one attack for game effects.  
  - If attacking Alien System, discard it and replace with next card.  
  - If attacking a player, they choose to use Basic Defense Plan or a Defense Plan card.  
  - Defense Plan cards are not discarded after use.  
  - Destroyed Ship: discard to bottom of Ship deck.  
  - Damaged Ship: return to Under Construction.  
  - Place Blockade Token: attacker places token on any card in defender’s Empire.  

- **Produce**: When producing Resources on a Planet:  
  - If one section matches Planet Type, you may choose it and gain 1 VP.  
  - Otherwise, choose section with fewer symbols (tie: choose either).  

- **Automatic Construction**: When completing a card grants resources or bonuses that fulfill the cost of another Under Construction card, move it to Empire immediately and resolve its effect. Resolve multiple completions one at a time.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Game Trigger**: When the Round marker is on '1', the next time the Resource deck is emptied, the end game is triggered.  
- After the triggering turn, all players take an equal number of turns. Reshuffle the Resource deck as needed.  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - +1 VP per card in Empire (Ships, Techs, Planets; not Resource cards).  
  - For each Operational Technology: score highest fulfilled condition in the "End Scoring" column. If it has a Blockade token, pay 1¢ to score it.  
  - Score Faction card’s endgame objective.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Most Credits in bank.  
  2. Most cards in Empire.  
  3. Shared victory.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I use Gold for Operational Actions?  
  A: No. Gold cannot be used to pay for Operational Actions.  
- Q: Can I use produced Resources on Planets for any action?  
  A: Yes, as if in hand, but Assembly Limit applies.  
- Q: Do Blockade tokens prevent all card effects?  
  A: Yes, the card is treated as blank unless you pay 1¢ per token to use its ability.  
- Q: Can I attack multiple targets in one turn?  
  A: No. All attacks in one action must target the same entity.  
- Q: Does “each time you attack” trigger multiple times when using Start an Offensive with multiple Ships?  
  A: No. The entire action counts as one attack for game effects.  
- Q: Can I look at the back of a deck before buying?  
  A: No. You cannot look at the top card before deciding to buy. Player aid provides clues about back side.
