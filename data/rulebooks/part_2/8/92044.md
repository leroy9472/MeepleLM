## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the role of warlords commanding one of four realms—Karkoth, Vailin, Iron Circle, or Nerathan—in a struggle for dominance over the continent of Nerath. Victory is determined by achieving a target number of Victory Points (VP), controlling all capitals, or collecting a set number of Treasure cards, depending on the chosen game length and mode (Free-for-All or Alliance).

**Victory Conditions by Game Type:**  
- **Free-for-All (Individual Play):**  
  - **Short:** First to 13 VP  
  - **Medium:** First to 20 VP  
  - **Long:** Control all four capitals **or** collect 8 Treasure cards (in hand and in play) and have more than any other player  

- **Alliance (Team Play – Good vs. Evil):**  
  - **Short:** Allies collectively reach 20 VP  
  - **Medium:** Allies collectively reach 30 VP  
  - **Long:** Allies control all capitals **or** collect 12 Treasure cards (combined) and have more than the opposing alliance  

In Short or Medium games, check for victory at the end of each full game round (after Nerath's turn). If multiple players meet the threshold, the one with the most VP wins. If tied, play an additional round and re-check.

     5. **Determine Results:**  
        - If all defenders destroyed and at least one attacker remains → attacker conquers space
