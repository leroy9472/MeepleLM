### 1. Lore & Objective
Dice Realms is set in late Medieval and early Renaissance Europe, where players rule small realms beset by invaders, plagues, harsh winters, and unpredictable harvests. The game captures the uncertainty of the era through dice mechanics and a dynamic Fate die that introduces external threats.

**Objective**:  
Be the player with the highest score at game end. Score is calculated from:
- Victory Points (VPs) earned during play via VP chips.
- VPs from improved die faces (2-dot = 1 VP, 4-dot = 2 VPs, Temple = 3 VPs, Monument = 4 VPs).
- Minus VPs from misery chips (−2 VP each).

The game ends when any of the 10VP, 10grain, or −10misery chips are used. The player with the most total VPs wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most grain wins.

### 2. Components
- **Dice**:  
  - 4 black, 4 white, 5 gray, 4 green, 1 red Fate die  
- **Die Faces (668 total)**:  
  - Colored faces for 5 standard lines (Lands, Farming, Commerce, Settlement, Progress)  
  - White special faces (e.g., Hero, Monument, Temple)  
  - Red attack faces (e.g., Robber, Plague)  
  - Green Lands faces for green dice  
- **Tokens & Chips**:  
  - 16 set-a-die tokens (cost 4 coins)  
  - 20 reroll tokens (cost 1 coin)  
  - VP chips (1, 2, 3, 10)  
  - Grain pieces and 4★ grain chips  
  - Misery chips (−2, −4★, −10)  
- **Tools**:  
  - 24 dice tools (for removing/replacing faces)  
  - 1 master tray (holds die faces)  
  - 2 storage trays  
  - 35 randomizer tiles (determine available die faces)  
  - Cloth bag for tiles  
- **Player Materials**:  
  - 4 treasury tiles (track coin and upgrades)  
  - 4 upgrade disks (track unspent upgrades)  

### 3. Setup
1. **Central Setup**:  
   - Place the master tray, summary tile, and red Fate die in the center.  
   - Assemble the Fate die with standard faces: Winter (×2), Good Harvest, Bad Harvest, Innovation, Robber.  
2. **Player Setup**:  
   - Give each player:  
     - 1 black die and 1 white die (initially identical)  
     - 1 treasury tile (coin side up), 1 dice tool, 1 upgrade disk  
     - 3 grain, 1 reroll token  
3. **Supply Setup**:  
   - For 2–3 players: Use 12 grain pieces, 18 VP chips (3×1, 2×2, 3×3 per player), 4×−2 misery chips per player.  
   - For 4 players: Use all available VP, grain, and misery chips.  
   - Set aside 10VP, −10misery, and 10grain chips for final round use.  
4. **Tile Setup**:  
   - Draw 5 randomizer tiles from the bag, respecting limits:  
     - 1 Fate die tile  
     - 1 Attack tile (white face)  
     - 1 line tile of each color  
   - Redraw if limits are exceeded.  
   - Place drawn tiles and their die faces in the center.  
   - Apply tile effects (e.g., add 4★ grain or −4★ misery per player).  
   - If a Fate die tile is drawn, modify the Fate die accordingly.  
   - If Monastery or Quarantine is drawn and no attack tiles, adjust Fate die per tile back.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round proceeds in 4 steps:

#### 1. Roll
- All players roll all their dice. The player holding the Fate die rolls it.
- **Winter (Fate die)**: If rolled, each player pays 1 grain per die they own. For each grain short, take a −2 misery chip.
- **Reroll**: Each player may reroll 1 die for free. May also use:
  - Reroll powers (e.g., Plow Team, Jack of all Trades)
  - Reroll tokens (cost 1 coin)
  - Set-a-die tokens (cost 4 coins; set any die to one of its faces)
  - Reroll faces trigger immediate reroll and power resolution; continue until non-reroll face is rolled (max 1 per die).
- **Attacks**:
  - Resolve Fate die attacks first (affect all players).
  - Then resolve player attacks clockwise from Fate die holder.
  - Attack types:
    - Grain attack: lose grain; −2 misery per grain short.
    - Loss of die: set aside one die (inactive this round).
    - Face destruction: replace one showing face with a Destroyed face (−2 VP at game end).
  - Defense: Shields ignore one attack each. Shields on set-aside dice can still defend.
  - Players cannot lose their last active die or last non-Destroyed face.

#### 2. Collect
- Collect grain and VP chips from die faces.
- Apply modifiers:
  - Good Harvest: +1 grain per grain face
  - Bad Harvest: −1 grain per grain face; may convert 2 grain → 1 coin
  - Aqueduct: +1 grain per grain face (cumulative)
- **Buy Phase**:
  - Total coins from faces + 1 if treasury has a coin.
  - Spend coins on:
    - Reroll token: 1 coin
    - Set-a-die token: 4 coins
    - Repair Destroyed face: 3 coins (swap with face on treasury)
    - Upgrade: 2 coins per upgrade (mark with upgrade disk)
    - Buy new die: 5 coins + 2 grain (gray or green)
  - Gray die: same as initial dice.
  - Green die: starts with six 1VP Barony faces; only green faces may be added.
  - Unused coins beyond 1 stored in treasury are lost.
  - Treasury refills only when player chooses to store 1 coin from excess.

#### 3. Upgrade
- Spend upgrades (from disk) to improve die faces.
- Upgrade types:
  - Same line, 1-dot → 2-dot: 1 upgrade
  - Same line, 2-dot → 4-dot: 2 upgrades (total 3 from 1-dot)
  - Crossgrade (change line/color at same dot level): 1 upgrade
  - 1-dot to different 4-dot: 4 upgrades (1 crossgrade + 3 upgrade)
  - To white 2-dot face: 2 upgrades (1 to 2-dot, 1 to change line)
- Restrictions:
  - Green dice: only green faces.
  - 1/ die faces: max one per die.
  - Cannot upgrade inactive (set-aside) or Destroyed faces.
  - Intermediate faces not required (e.g., skip 2-dot to go directly to 4-dot).
- Unspent upgrades are lost.

#### 4. Check Game End
- If 10VP, 10grain, or −10misery chips were used this round, the game ends.
- Otherwise, pass the Fate die clockwise and begin next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Dice Specialization**: Replace die faces to increase probability of desired outcomes (e.g., more coins, grain, defense).
- **Rerolls & Control**: Use free reroll, tokens, and set-a-die tokens to ensure key faces appear.
- **Resource Trade-offs**:
  - Grain: needed for Winter, but overproduction ends the game.
  - Coins: flexible; used for dice, tokens, upgrades.
  - Upgrades: improve faces for long-term VP gain.
- **Set-a-Die Tokens**: Enable powerful endgame combos (e.g., Cattle Round-up).
- **Fate Die**: Introduces randomness and pressure (Winter, attacks, upgrades).
- **Player Attacks**: Optional; used to hinder opponents (Grain Robber, Saboteur).
- **Green Dice**: Specialized for VP chips via Lands line and Steward.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End Triggers**:
  - VP chips, grain pieces, or −2 misery chips require use of 10-value chips.
  - Represents realm collapse due to overproduction, famine, or despair.
- **Scoring**:
  - Count VPs from:
    - 2-dot faces: 1 VP each
    - 4-dot faces: 2 VPs each
    - Temple (6-dot): 3 VPs
    - Monument (8-dot): 4 VPs (plus 9 listed VPs = 13 total)
  - Add VP chips collected.
  - Subtract misery chips (−2 VP each).
  - Destroyed faces: −2 VP each.
- **Winning**: Highest score wins. Tiebreaker: most grain → shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I use a shield from a set-aside die?** Yes, unused shields on set-aside dice can defend.
- **Can I lose my last die?** No. A player cannot lose their last active die to an attack.
- **Can I use a power in the middle of another power?** No. Powers must be resolved fully and in sequence.
- **Can I reroll a die multiple times?** Only if it has a reroll face or you spend multiple tokens.
- **Can I upgrade a face that isn’t showing?** Yes. Any non-Destroyed face on an active die can be upgraded.
- **What if a face runs out?** The Fate die holder gets first access, then clockwise.
- **Can I use Banker twice in one turn?** Only if you have two Banker faces showing.
- **Does Winter use grain I collect this turn?** No. Grain must be paid before Collect step.
- **Can I use Collect powers on a newly repaired face?** No. Powers cannot be used on faces repaired this turn.
