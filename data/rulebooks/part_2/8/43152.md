## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players are tribal chieftains in 2000 BC Assyria, competing to expand their influence through settlement, religious offerings, and political intrigue in the city of Assur. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) over three reigns by strategically managing resources, constructing ziggurats, placing huts, and influencing dignitaries. The player with the highest VP at the end of the third reign wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most constructed ziggurat levels wins; if still tied, the player with the most huts wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place board centrally. Set wells aside.  
2. Each player:  
   - Chooses a color and takes all matching pieces and 1 Plow card.  
   - Places discs at start of score, camel, and offerings tracks.  
   - Randomly places a disc on the turn order track.  
3. Shuffle Food cards; place face down. Place Bonus card aside (4-player only).  
4. Place one Expansion card (value 4) in the first expansion slot (E). Shuffle remaining Expansion cards and place face down.  
5. First player draws and sets up Food cards:  
   - Draw 5 Food cards, arrange in ascending order (by number of symbols, left to right). Wild cards go far right.  
   - Draw 5 more, form second row beneath first (5 columns of 2 cards).  
6. In turn order, each player places a ziggurat base on one of the 4 marked starting spaces (M).  
7. Last player draws N Food cards (N = player count):  
   - 4 players: draws 4, chooses 1, passes rest in reverse order.  
   - 3 players: draws 3  
   - 2 players: draws 2  
   Each player takes one card face up.  

Adjustments:  
- 3 players: use 12 wells, 3 Plow cards, draw 4 Food cards per sowing.  
- 2 players: use 8 wells, 2 Plow cards, draw 3 Food cards per sowing.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of **3 reigns**:  
- Reign 1: 2 turns  
- Reigns 2 and 3: 3 turns each  

Each turn follows this sequence:  

#### I. Farming  
- **Sowing**: First player draws N+1 Food cards twice (5 for 4p, 4 for 3p, 3 for 2p), arranges each row in ascending order (by symbol count), wilds on far right. Forms N+1 columns of 2 cards.  
- **Harvest**: In turn order, each player selects one column, takes both cards, places their turn order disc above the column.  
- **New Turn Order**: Determined by disc positions from left to right. Leftmost disc is new first player.  

#### II. Expansion (in new turn order)  
Each player performs all steps:  
- **New Huts**: Take number of huts equal to current Expansion card value. Place on empty hexes adjacent to own hut or ziggurat.  
- **Resupply**: Use Food and Plow cards to resupply huts. Each symbol on a card feeds one matching hut. Plow cards are wild. Cards used are discarded (Plow cards go to board space). Resupplying is mandatory if possible.  
- **Famine**: Remove all unsupplied huts (not centered on hex). Return to stock.  
- **Wells**: May place a well at intersection of 3 player-controlled hexes. Cannot be adjacent to a ziggurat or between rivers. Wells remain for the game.  
- **Revenue & Prestige**:  
  - **Revenue (Camels)**:  
    - First hut on each river: 3 camels  
    - Subsequent huts on same river: 2 camels  
    - Max 10 camels; advance camel track accordingly.  
  - **Prestige (VP)**:  
    - Hut between rivers: 2 VP  
    - Hut outside rivers: 1 VP  
    - Ziggurat tile (base, center, roof): 1 VP each  
    - Well built this turn: 6 VP (R1), 5 VP (R2), 4 VP (R3) — scored only once, in building turn.  

#### III. Actions (in same turn order)  
Spend camels on:  
- **Build/Extend Ziggurat**:  
  - Build: On hex with own hut (not on river, not next to well). Spend 6 camels. Replace hut with base.  
  - Extend: Add center (3 camels) or roof (2 camels). Only one level per ziggurat per turn.  
- **Create Intrigue (Assur)**: Spend camels to place huts on dignitary spaces:  
  - Higher: 4 camels per hut  
  - Middle: 3 camels per hut  
  - Lower: 2 camels per hut  
  Place on highest available space per dignitary.  
- **Make Offering**: Spend 1–3 camels. Move offering track disc forward by spent amount. Once per turn.  
- **Buy Card**:  
  - Buy 1 Food card (cost on card) from remaining pool.  
  - Buy 1 Plow card if none owned and one remains.  
  Cannot buy 2 Food cards or own 2 Plow cards.  

#### End of Turn  
- If not final turn of reign:  
  - First player draws new Expansion card, places it below previous.  
  - All players reset huts to bottom of hexes.  
  - Next turn begins at Farming.  
- If final turn of reign: Proceed to **Flood Phase**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Turn Order**: Reset every turn based on Harvest column choices.  
- **Resource Management**: Food cards used for resupply; camels earned via rivers, used for actions.  
- **Ziggurat Construction**: Requires camels. Each tile (base, center, roof) scores 1 VP.  
- **Intrigue**: Huts placed on dignitaries grant influence points and end-of-reign bonuses.  
- **Offerings**: Track position multiplies number of ziggurat sites (not tiles) for VP at flood.  
- **Wells**: Permanent, score VP only in building turn.  
- **Camel Cap**: 10 max. Extra camels lost.  
- **Card Limits**: Max 1 Plow card; cards kept between turns.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Flood Phase (End of Each Reign)  
- **Flooding**: Remove all huts on river hexes. Return to owners.  
- **Assur (Influence Scoring)**:  
  - Influence Points (IP):  
    - Higher dignitary: 3 IP per hut  
    - Middle: 2 IP per hut  
    - Lower: 1 IP per hut  
  - Rank players by IP. Ties broken by:  
    1. Most huts placed on dignitaries  
    2. Highest hut on board  
  - Scoring:  
    - 1st: Sum of all Expansion cards (include Bonus in 4p games for R2/R3)  
    - 2nd: Sum of remaining cards after highest is discarded  
    - 3rd: Sum after next highest discarded (if any)  
    - 4p: 4th scores last remaining card  
    - 2p: 2nd scores nothing in R1; lowest card in R2/R3  
    - 3p: 3rd scores nothing in R1  
- **Dignitary Bonuses**:  
  - **Higher**: 1 hut = 1 VP, 2 = 4 VP, 3 = 8 VP  
  - **Middle**: At least 1 hut → 1 Plow card (max 1 per player)  
  - **Lower**: 1 camel per hut placed  
  - Return huts after scoring.  
- **Offerings Scoring**:  
  - VP = (Offering track position) × (Number of ziggurat sites)  
  - Reset offering track to 0.  
- **Next Reign Setup**:  
  - 4-player games: Place Bonus card on board for R2 and R3.  
  - First player draws new Expansion card, places in slot 1.  
  - Reset huts to bottom of hexes.  
  - Begin new turn.  

#### Final Scoring (End of Reign 3)  
- 1 VP per ziggurat tile (base, center, roof)  
- 1 VP per Plow card in hand  
- 1 VP per 2 camels (round down)  

**Winner**: Highest total VP.  
**Tiebreakers**:  
1. Most constructed ziggurat levels  
2. Most huts on board
