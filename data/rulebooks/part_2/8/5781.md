## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Edel, Stein & Reich is a strategic card-driven game centered around gem trading, event management, and economic dominance. Players take on the roles of gem traders competing for wealth and influence. The objective is to accumulate the most money by the end of the third scoring round through gem majorities, event-based scoring, and certificate holdings.

2. Components  
- Action cards: Money, Event, Gems, and Free Choice (only in 5-player game)  
- Gem cards: Show combinations of colored gems (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue)  
- Event cards: Two types — “Wertung” (scoring) and “Sofort” (immediate effect)  
- Gems: Colored tokens in four colors (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue)  
- Money: Currency used for scoring and rewards  
- Score card: Indicates payout values for color majorities  

3. Setup  
- Each player receives:  
  - 3 Action cards (Money, Event, Gems)  
  - 3 gems of each color (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue)  
- In a 5-player game, each player also receives a Free Choice Action card.  
- Shuffle the Event cards and place them face down into a stack.  
- Shuffle the Gem cards and place them face down into a stack.  
- Reveal the top Gem cards and discard them face-up:  
  - 3 players: discard top 6 Gem cards  
  - 4 players: discard top 2 Gem cards  
  - (Note: 5-player discard amount not specified — assumed same as 4-player or omitted)  

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Reveal Cards**:  
   - Turn over the top Gem card and place it face-up in front of each player.  
   - Turn over the top Event card and place it face-up for all to see.  
2. **Action Selection**:  
   - Each player selects one Action card and places it face-down.  
   - All cards are revealed simultaneously.  
3. **Action Resolution Order**:  
   Resolve actions in this order:  
   - Money  
   - Event  
   - Gems  
   - Free Choice (if applicable)  
   For each action type:  
   - If only 1 player chose it: that player performs the action freely.  
   - If 3 or more players chose it: no one performs the action.  
   - If exactly 2 players chose it: they must barter to determine who performs the action.  
4. **Action Effects**:  
   - **Money**: Player receives from the Bank the amount shown on their face-up Gem card.  
   - **Event**: Player may:  
     - Execute the face-up Event card, OR  
     - Discard it and reveal the top face-down Event card, then choose to execute or discard that one.  
     - “Sofort” (immediate) cards are resolved and discarded.  
     - “Wertung” (scoring) cards are kept until a scoring round.  
   - **Gems**: Player takes from the supply the exact gems shown on their Gem card, if available.  
   - **Free Choice**:  
     - If only 1 player chose it: may trade any 1 gem for any 2 gems from the supply.  
     - If 2 or more players chose it: each chooses 1 gem from the supply in barter turn order.  
5. **Cleanup**:  
   - Players retrieve their Action cards.  
   - All Gem cards and unclaimed Event cards are discarded.  
   - If Gem cards remain in the deck, start a new turn.  
   - If the Gem deck is empty, trigger a Scoring Round.  
   - After scoring: reshuffle all Gem cards, then discard face-up:  
     - 3 players: 6 cards  
     - 4 or 5 players: 2 cards  
   - Begin a new round.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Action Drafting**: Simultaneous selection and resolution with interaction based on player count per action.  
- **Bartering**:  
  - Triggered when exactly two players select the same action.  
  - Determines who performs the action via gem offers.  
  - **Initiative**: Determined by gem holdings in order: Red (fewest goes first), then Yellow, Green, Blue. If tied in all, younger player starts (or random).  
  - **Bidding**: Players alternate offers; each new offer must be higher.  
    - Higher offer = more gems.  
    - If equal number: compare Red gems, then Yellow, Green, Blue in order.  
  - Winner of barter (the one whose offer is accepted) receives the offered gems; loser performs the action.  
- **Gem Acquisition & Management**: Players collect and spend gems; used in bartering and scoring.  
- **Event Card Use**: Strategic choice between current and future Event cards; “Wertung” cards are saved for scoring.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Scoring Round occurs when the Gem deck is exhausted. All players:  
1. **Color Majorities**:  
   - For each color (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue):  
     - Player with the most gems in that color gains money from the score card + any applicable “Wertung” Event cards.  
     - If tied:  
       - Money is split evenly, rounded down.  
       - Each tied player returns 2 gems of that color to the supply.  
     - Otherwise:  
       - Winner returns half their gems in that color (rounded up) to the supply.  
2. **Certificates**:  
   - Player with most Certificate equivalents (from “Wertung” cards) receives 10 Million.  
   - Player with second-most receives 4 Million.  
   - Tie for first: each tied player gets 10 Million; second place not awarded.  
   - Tie for second: each tied player gets 4 Million.  
3. **Cleanup**: All Event cards (used or not) are discarded.  
The game ends after the **third scoring round**. The player with the most money wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **What if multiple actions tie in player count?**  
  Each action is resolved independently in the fixed order (Money → Event → Gems → Free Choice).  
- **Can gems be used for multiple barter negotiations?**  
  Yes, as long as they are in the player’s stock.  
- **Are “Wertung” cards public knowledge?**  
  Assumed to be held privately until scoring, but must be revealed then.  
- **What happens if the supply lacks gems for a Gems action?**  
  Player receives only what is available.  
- **Can a player pass or avoid selecting an action?**  
  No — each player must play one Action card each turn.  
- **Is Free Choice available in 3- and 4-player games?**  
  No — only in 5-player games.  
- **What if the Event deck runs out?**  
  Cards discarded during gameplay are not reshuffled; play continues if possible, though source does not specify reshuffling.
