## NIEUW AMSTERDAM — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 1621, the Dutch West India Company established Nieuw Amsterdam on Manhattan Island to dominate the North American fur trade. Players take on the roles of *patroons*—wealthy landowners—who develop land, build businesses, trade with the Lenape, and ship furs to Europe. Victory is earned through strategic expansion, political influence, and resource management.  

**Objective**: Score the most Victory Points (VP) over 6 rounds through land development, elections, fur trade, and final scoring.

### 4. Gameplay Flow (6 Rounds)  
Each round has four phases:

#### **Preparation Phase**
1. **Refill New Cards**:
   - Discard remaining Land/Ship Cards from New slots (remove from game).
   - Draw 4 new Land Cards and 4 new Ship Cards.
2. **Refill Fur Spaces**:
   - Fill empty spaces on Lenape Traders with Furs from reserve.
   - If reserve is empty, reshuffle discard pile to form new reserve.
3. **Refill Cash Box**:
   - Shuffle 12 Action Tiles face-down.
   - Fill all 12 Cash Box spaces face-up randomly.

#### **Bidding Phase**
- Number of auctions = number of players.
- **Auction Process**:
  1. Player with lowest Turn Order Token (among unbought) chooses a column and places their token on top. Must bid (can bid 0).
  2. Remaining players (in turn order) bid higher or pass.
  3. Highest bidder wins:
     - Pays bid in any combination of resources (Coins, Furs, Goods, Wood, Corn; all equal value).
     - Takes Action Tiles, Turn Order Token, and any bonus Coins.
     - If winner ≠ chooser, winner gives their original Turn Order Token to the chooser.
  4. Winner exits; repeat until one player remains.
  5. Last player takes any remaining column for free (keeps current Turn Order Token).

- **2-Player Rule**:
  - #1 player must choose a 3-tile column.
  - Loser takes a 2-tile column for free.

#### **Action Phase** (3 Steps: City, Land, Trade)  
Each step: players act in turn order. On your turn:
- Spend **all** Action Tiles of that type (if any), one per action.
- Take **one** Special Action (optional).
- Can **pass** on tile actions (discard tile → gain 1 Coin).
- Can **pass** on Special Action → gain 1 Coin.

##### **1. City Step**
- **Build Businesses**:
  - Place 1–3 Buildings in city districts.
  - Cost: 1 Wood per Building.
  - Buildings = Businesses.
- **Hold Elections**:
  - Score 3 VP per district where you have majority.
  - Score 2 VP per district where tied for majority.
  - Only the active player scores.

##### **2. Land Step**
- **Add Land**:
  - Take 1 Land Card from New Land slots.
  - Add to right of your Land Cards (or right of Wharf if first).
  - Place 1 Wood on card (uncleared).
  - Move leftmost Longhouse to next Camp upriver.
    - If no space → remove from game.
    - Final Camp’s last Longhouse is permanent (never removed).
- **Clear Land**:
  - Clear **all** un-cleared Land Cards that are **fully filled with Houses**.
  - Remove Wood marker(s).
  - Take Wood from reserve as shown on each card.
  - Score VP for **rightmost** cleared card using scoring table:
    - Positions (left to right): 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36.

##### **3. Trade Step**
- **Trade with Lenape for Furs**:
  - Trade Goods for Furs from one Trader:
    - Top: 1 Good → 1 Fur (any)
    - Middle: 4 Goods → 3 Furs (all types)
    - Bottom: 3 Goods → 4 Furs (all types)
  - **Traveling Fee**:
    - If no Longhouse across river from your Trading Post:
      - Pay Corn = total shown on boats between your Post and nearest occupied Camp.
      - Fee is once per action, not per trade.
- **Ship Furs**:
  - Choose one Ship Card (in New Ship slots).
  - Pay exact number of Furs (any combination).
  - VP: First fur type = 3 VP/fur, second = 2 VP/fur, third+ = 1 VP/fur.
  - Gain Coins as shown on card.
  - Discard shipped Furs (face-up pile).
  - Take Ship Card → place left of Wharf (Goods value visible).

#### **Provisions & Income Phase**
1. **Collect Corn**:
   - Gain Corn from each **cleared** Land Card (as shown).
   - Large barrels = 5 Corn.
2. **Pay for Businesses**:
   - Discard 1 Corn per Business (in city districts).
   - If short: pay all you can, then remove 1 Business per missing Corn (your choice).
   - Lose 2 VP per removed Business (score ≥ 0).
   - Resolve in turn order if multiple players affected.
3. **Collect Goods**:
   - Gain Goods from all collected Ship Cards (sum Goods values).
   - Store on unlocked piers of Wharf Card.
   - Discard excess (no overflow).
4. **Income**:
   - Gain 1 Coin per **occupied** district (≥1 Business).
   - Gain 1 Coin per **controlled** district (outright majority, no tie).

End of round. If no cards left in decks → Game End.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Action Tiles**: Used in sets (City, Land, Trade); each tile = 1 action.
- **Turn Order**: Determined by Bidding Phase; changes each round.
- **Longhouse Movement**: Driven by "Add Land"; represents Lenape displacement.
- **Trading Post Movement**: Use Trading Company Special Action (1 Wood).
- **Special Actions** (1 per step, max 3/round):
  - Cost 1 Coin unless you control the district.
  - Available in any step:
    1. **Lumberyard**: 1 Coin ↔ 1 Wood (buy/sell any amount)
    2. **Granary**: 1 Coin ↔ 1 Corn (buy/sell any amount)
    3. **Docks**: 1 Wood → 1 Warehouse (unlocks pier; max 4 total)
    4. **Millwork**: 1 Wood per House → add 1–3 Houses (left to right)
    5. **Black Market**: Buy 1–3 Furs (random): 3/6/9 cost (Coins, Goods, or mix)
    6. **Trading Company**: 1 Wood → move Trading Post upriver (nearest available space; cannot leapfrog beyond farthest Longhouse)

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after 6 rounds (no more Land/Ship Cards). Final scoring:

1. **Final Elections**:
   - 3 VP per district with majority.
   - 2 VP per district with tie for majority.
   - All players score (unlike during game).

2. **Rightmost Filled Land Card (if uncleared)**:
   - Score VP for **rightmost** Land Card **filled with Houses** but **not yet cleared**.
   - Use scoring table: position in row → VP (e.g., 5th card = 15 VP).
   - If cleared → 0 VP.

3. **Surplus Furs and Resources**:
   - 1 VP per Fur held.
   - 1 VP per 3 total of (Goods + Corn + Wood + Coins); remainder ignored.

**Winner**: Highest total VP. Tie → shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build on a Land Card not fully built left-to-right?**  
  No. Houses must be built left to right (via Millwork or building during Add Land).

- **Can I use Special Actions without Action Tiles?**  
  Yes. You may always take one Special Action per step, even with no tiles.

- **What if I can’t move a Longhouse during Add Land?**  
  Remove it from the game. Exception: last Longhouse in final Camp is permanent.

- **Can I move my Trading Post beyond the farthest Longhouse?**  
  No. You may only move to a space ≤ farthest occupied Lenape Camp.

- **Do I score VP for multiple clearing actions in one round?**  
  No. Only the **rightmost** card cleared in a single Clear Land action scores VP.

- **Can I pass on a tile action and still take the Special Action?**  
  Yes. Passing on tiles or Special Action gives 1 Coin; actions are independent.

- **What if I run out of a resource during bidding?**  
  Use substitute markers. Resources are unlimited.

- **Can I sell Wood/Corn at Lumberyard/Granary without buying?**  
  Yes. Buy or sell any amount at 1:1.
