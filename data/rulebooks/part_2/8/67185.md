## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The temple of Sobek is under construction, sparking a bustling economy along the Nile. Players are merchants competing to amass wealth through trade, using goods delivered by feluccas. While gaining money is the goal, excessive corruption carries penalties. Over 3 rounds, players aim to earn the most victory points. The game ends after Round 3, or early if a player exceeds 100 points after Round 2 (including corruption penalties).

**Primary Objective:** Score the most points across three rounds without letting corruption undo your gains.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the gameboard in the center.  
2. Each player chooses a color, takes:  
   - 1 scoring marker → place on 0 of scoring track  
   - 1 corruption tile → place in front of them  
3. Shuffle the 12 event tokens face down.  
   - Randomly select 5; place them in a pile next to the board.  
   - Return unused 7 to the box (not used this round).  
4. Shuffle all goods and character cards together into a single deck.  
5. Draw 9 cards and place them face up along the Nile quays, starting from the temple side, following these rules:  
   - Goods cards (beige back): face up  
   - Character cards (orange back): face down  
6. Randomly determine the starting player for Round 1.  

> Note: After each goods delivery phase, 9 cards are drawn and placed the same way.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order. On your turn, choose **one** of the following actions:

#### A. Take a Card  
- Take one of the first 4 cards from the Nile quay (leftmost = first available).  
- If you take a card that is **not the first**, all cards skipped go **under your corruption tile** (in order).  
- Applies to both goods and character cards.  
- Taking the first card → no corruption.  

> Example: If you take the 3rd card, the 1st and 2nd are placed under your corruption tile.

#### B. Play a Character  
- Play **one** character card from your hand face up to the discard pile.  
- Immediately activate its special power (see *The Characters* section).  
- Once played this way, the character **cannot** be used in a set later.  
- A character has no trade value.  

> Note: You may play a character even if its power has no current effect (e.g., to reduce hand size).

#### C. Play a Set  
- Play **at least 3 goods cards** of the same type face up in front of you.  
- Sets may include:  
  - Amulets (act as jokers for any type)  
  - Character cards of the matching goods type (but their power is **not** used)  
- You may add cards to an existing set later, but only by adding **at least 3 new cards** of the same type.  
- Playing a set triggers an **Event Token** if any remain.  

#### Event Tokens (when playing a set)  
- While at least one event token remains:  
  - Take all remaining tokens, choose one, apply its effect immediately, then discard it.  
  - You may choose a token with no effect or one that harms opponents.  
  - Some tokens have lasting effects (e.g., Curse stays with a player).  

#### Goods Deliveries  
- When a player takes the **last card** from the Nile, they must refill the quay:  
  - Draw 9 new cards from the deck.  
  - Place them following setup rules (beige = face up, orange = face down).  
- Number of deliveries per round:  
  - 2 players: 5 deliveries  
  - 3–4 players: 6 deliveries

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Character Powers  
Each character belongs to a goods family and has a unique ability:

| Character | Power |
|--------|-------|
| **Queen Sobek Neferou** | Draw 3 cards. *Effect:* Final goods delivery of the round has only 6 cards (instead of 9). |
| **High Priest/ess** | Discard all cards of one goods type from your corruption pile. Includes matching characters, but **not** amulets. |
| **Thief** | Randomly steal one card from another player’s hand. You see the backs (colors) but not the card. |
| **Scribe** | All opponents must reduce their hand to 6 cards. Excess cards go under their corruption tile. |
| **Vizir** | Take any one card from an opponent’s corruption pile (you may look through it). |
| **Courtisan** | Add 1 or 2 cards from your hand to an existing set (must match the set’s type). |
| **Merchant** | Take any one card from the remaining Nile cards (not just first 4), without taking corruption or discarding others. |

> Reminder: A character can be used **either** for power **or** in a set — never both.

#### Amulets  
- Can substitute for any goods type in a set.  
- Have no trade value when played alone.  
- Cannot be discarded via High Priest/ess power.

#### Event Tokens (Detailed)  
- **Guild (4x):** Move your marker to the next space with the same symbol on the scoring track. Also move **one opponent’s** marker back to the previous space of the same symbol.  
- **Flood (2x):** Take an extra turn immediately after this one.  
- **Curse (2x):** Give to an opponent. Counts as **2 extra corruption cards** at round end. Stays with their corruption pile until round ends.  
- **Prosperity (2x):** Attach to a set of **wheat, fish, or cattle** already in front of you. Adds **+2 scarabs** to the set’s trade value.  
- **Embalming (1x):** Add all cards from your corruption pile to your hand.  
- **Deceit (1x):** Reveal the number of cards under your corruption tile. Score that many points. Then return the cards under the tile.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End of Round  
- When the **last card of the final delivery** is taken, the round ends immediately.  
- Remaining players may play **one final action**:  
  - Play any sets of **3 or more cards** from hand.  
    - These are placed **horizontally** to distinguish them from in-round sets.  
    - Cannot add to existing sets.  
- Any unplayed cards in hand:  
  - Single cards or pairs → go under your corruption tile.  
  - Characters cannot be played (round is over).  

#### Scoring  
Each set scores:  
> **(Total Scarabs in the Set) × (Number of Cards in the Set)**  

For **horizontal sets** (played at round end):  
> **(Total Scarabs) + (Total Scarabs)** — i.e., scarabs are **added**, not multiplied.  

**Example:**  
- 3-card fish set (4 scarabs each): 4 × 3 = 12 points  
- 3-card wheat set (2 scarabs each): 2 × 3 = 6 points  
- 3-card horizontal ivory set (1 scarab each): 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 points  
- Total: 12 + 6 + 3 = **21 points**

Add total to your score on the track.

#### Corruption Penalty  
- Count cards under your corruption tile.  
- The player with the **most corruption cards** loses points:  
  - For every **full 10 points scored this round**, move your marker back to the **previous symbol of the same type** on the track.  
  - Ignore fractions.  

> Example: You scored 23 points this round → 2 “tens” → move back 2 symbols of the same type (e.g., two Ankh symbols).  

**Tie in Corruption?**  
- Compare total scarabs on corruption cards. Higher scarabs = more corrupt.  
- Still tied? All tied players are penalized.

> Note: If a player exceeds 100 points after Round 2 (post-penalty), the game ends early.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a character and use its power after the last card is taken?**  
  No. The round ends immediately when the last card is taken. Only final set plays are allowed.

- **Can I add cards to a set using the Courtisan during the final phase?**  
  No. Final phase only allows playing new horizontal sets. Adding to existing sets is not allowed.

- **What happens to unused event tokens?**  
  Discarded at the end of the round. Only 5 are used per round.

- **Can I choose not to play a set during the final phase?**  
  Yes. But any unplayable cards (less than 3 of a type) go to corruption.

- **Does the Queen reduce all future deliveries or just the last?**  
  Only the **last delivery** of the round has 6 cards instead of 9.

- **Can I use the Merchant to take a card from the Nile after a delivery?**  
  Yes — Merchant lets you take **any visible card** from the Nile (not limited to first 4), without corruption.

- **What if multiple players are tied for most corruption?**  
  Use scarab count on corruption cards. If still tied, all are penalized.

- **Can Embalming or Deceit be taken via Vizir?**  
  No — these are tokens, not cards. Only card effects apply to Vizir, Thief, etc.

- **Can a character be used in a set if it was saved in hand?**  
  Yes — as long as it matches the set type. But its power is not used.
