### 1. Lore & Objective  
Gang of Four is a strategic card game focused on shedding cards and outmaneuvering opponents through tactical play and card exchanges. The objective is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards and avoid being the "loser" of the hand, which determines scoring. Players aim to minimize their point total over multiple hands, as the loser accumulates penalty points.

### 2. Components  
- A custom deck of 64 cards:  
  - For each integer $1 \leq n \leq 10$, there are four cards of value $n$ in four different colours.  
  - Two special cards:  
    - Multicoloured 1 (acts as a wild 1 in flushes and straight flushes, outranks all other 1s)  
    - Phoenix (can represent any single card in pairs or full houses, but not in other five-card combinations)  
- Total: $4 \times 10 + 2 = 64$ cards  

---

### 3. Setup  
- Shuffle the deck and deal 16 cards to each of the four players.  
- The player holding the multicoloured 1 starts the first hand.  
- Direction of play for the first hand is **anticlockwise**.  
- The number of cards in each player’s hand is public knowledge at all times.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Starting a Hand**:  
   - First hand: Player with the multicoloured 1 begins. They may play it alone or as part of a legal combination.  
   - Subsequent hands: Winner of the previous hand starts. Before play begins:  
     - The loser gives their **highest card** to the winner.  
     - The winner returns **any different card** (may have same value/colour) to the loser.  
     - Both cards are revealed to all players.  

2. **Direction of Play**:  
   - Alternates with each hand:  
     - Hand 1: Anticlockwise  
     - Hand 2: Clockwise  
     - Hand 3: Anticlockwise, etc.  

3. **Playing a Turn**:  
   - On your turn, you must either:  
     - Play a legal card combination that **beats** the current one (not just equal it), or  
     - **Pass** (you can pass even if you could play).  
   - You may pass and later re-enter the same cycle by playing a valid, higher combination.  
   - All plays must follow the current type of combination (e.g., if a pair is led, only pairs can be played unless passing).  

4. **Ending a Cycle**:  
   - A cycle ends when all players pass consecutively after a play.  
   - The player who made the last play leads the next cycle with any legal combination.  

5. **Last Card Rule**:  
   - When reduced to **one card**, you **must announce** “last card” immediately upon reaching that state.  
   - If you fail to announce:  
     - You must **pass** on every subsequent turn.  
     - You cannot start a cycle.  
     - Another player starts in your place if needed.  
     - You will end the hand with one card and score **1 point**.  
   - If you play **multiple cards** to empty your hand (e.g., a pair as last move), the last card rule does not apply.  

6. **Special Restrictions When Preceding Last-Card Player**:  
   - If you play immediately before a player who has announced “last card”:  
     - If you are **starting a cycle**, you **must play more than one card** if able.  
     - If the cycle is in **single cards**, and your highest card is playable, you must either:  
       - Play that highest card, or  
       - Play a **Gang** (four-of-a-kind).

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Legal Card Combinations  
- **Single card**  
- **Pair**: Two cards of same value  
- **Triple**: Three cards of same value  
- **Straight**: Five consecutive values (e.g., 3–4–5–6–7), colours irrelevant  
- **Flush**: Five cards of same colour, values not necessarily consecutive  
- **Full House**: Triple + Pair  
- **Four-of-a-Kind (Gang)**: Four cards of same value  
- **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive values, all same colour  

> Note: **Two Pair** is **not** a valid combination.

#### Special Cards  
- **Multicoloured 1**:  
  - Can be used as a 1 of **any colour** in straights, flushes, or straight flushes.  
  - Always **outranks** other 1s, even of the same colour used in the combination.  
- **Phoenix**:  
  - Can represent **any single card** in value and colour.  
  - Can be used in:  
    - A **pair** (including in a Full House)  
    - As a wild card in straights/flushes  
  - **Cannot** be used in any **five-card combination** beyond straights, flushes, full houses, or straight flushes.  
  - **May only be played on its own** as a single card (cannot be part of a multi-card single-card play).  

#### Comparing Combinations  
- Compare combinations **card by card**, from **highest to lowest**.  
- For **Full House**:  
  - Order for comparison:  
    1. Top card of the triple  
    2. Second card of the triple  
    3. Bottom card of the triple  
    4. Top card of the pair  
    5. Bottom card of the pair  

#### Colour and Value Hierarchy  
- **Face value dominates colour**  
- For $1 \leq n \leq 10$: higher value beats lower  
- For $1 \leq n \leq 9$: straights are valid regardless of colour  
- Colour order exists but is **only used to break ties** when values are equal (exact colour order not specified in source)

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The **loser** of the hand is:  
  1. The player with the **most cards remaining** at the end.  
  2. In case of a tie:  
     - The tied player with the **highest total score so far** (including current hand) loses.  
  3. If still tied:  
     - The tied player **closest in anticlockwise direction** to the winner loses.  
- The loser scores **penalty points** equal to the number of cards they hold at the end.  
- If a player fails to announce "last card", they **must pass** for the rest of the hand and will end with one card → scores **1 point**.  
- Game continues over multiple hands; players aim to **minimize total score**.  
- Winner of the hand scores **0 points**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I pass and then play later?**  
  Yes. Passing is allowed even with playable cards. You may re-enter the cycle later with a higher combination.  

- **Can Phoenix be used in a Gang?**  
  No. Phoenix cannot substitute in four-of-a-kind.  

- **Can I use multicoloured 1 in a straight as a 10?**  
  No. It is only a 1, but can act as 1 of any colour in straights (e.g., A-2-3-4-5).  

- **What if two players tie for fewest cards?**  
  Only the loser is determined. The player who gets rid of all cards wins the hand. Others may have varying counts.  

- **Does direction affect card passing?**  
  No. Card exchange happens before each hand, regardless of direction. Direction only affects turn order.  

- **Can I win by playing multiple cards as my last move?**  
  Yes. This bypasses the “last card” announcement rule entirely.  

- **Is Two Pair ever allowed?**  
  No. Explicitly invalid, even for poker players.
