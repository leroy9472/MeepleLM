## El Capitán – Comprehensive Reference Manual

---

### 1. Lore & Objective

In the 15th century, players are powerful Mediterranean merchants competing to become the most renowned and wealthy trader. By establishing warehouses in key cities and protecting them with fortresses, players earn income through proliferation (presence in cities), majority control, and fortress ownership. The game ends after three phases, and the player with the most money wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

The game consists of **three phases**, each ending in a **payday**. A phase ends when **one player has built all their available warehouses and fortresses**. The current round finishes so all players have equal turns.

Each turn consists of:
1. **Optional: Buy sailing cards** (any number, before or after sailing/action)
2. **Optional: Sail** (must be before any action)
3. **Perform one of three actions:**
   - Build a warehouse (or re-open a shut-down one)
   - Build a fortress
   - Take a loan (only at bank)

After each phase:
- Payday (income for proliferation, majority, fortresses)
- Loan repayment or extension
- Money check
- Select next starting player
- Refill warehouses and fortresses

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Sailing Cards

**Destination/Sea Route Cards:**
- Allow direct sail to named city (any starting point).
- Or: Sail up to X cities in horizontal/perpendicular directions (X = number of seals on card).
- Can be used from any city, bank, or start of game.

**City Interconnection Cards:**
- Cheaper, but only allow one-way travel between two specific cities.
- Player must be in one of the two cities to use the card.

**Sailing Rules:**
- Sailing is optional and must occur before taking an action.
- Multiple cards can be played in one turn.
- Ship must end in a city with a free harbor space (unless continuing).
- Harbor 1 (cheaper) filled first; if occupied, use Harbor 2.
- If both harbors occupied, cannot dock—must continue sailing.
- Sailing to bank is free and requires no card.

#### Building a Warehouse

- Must have ship docked in a harbor of the city.
- Pay cost shown on harbor space.
- Place warehouse on next available building site on U-track.
- First builder chooses between Site 1 ("o") or Site 2.
- Subsequent warehouses go on next free adjacent site.
- **Limit:** No more than **3 of same color in a row**.
- After 3 in a row, must wait for another player to build before continuing.

#### Building a Fortress

- Must have ship docked in harbor.
- Pay cost shown on fortress space (8 or 10 Florin).
- Only one fortress per player per city.
- Only one fortress space per city (blocks after use).

#### Warehouse Shut Down

- When a warehouse is built on a **dark-colored space**, the **first warehouse in the chain** is shut down.
- Shut-down warehouse is moved to the city’s central image.
- **Does not count** for proliferation, majority, or income.
- **Exception (Porto):** Shut-down warehouses are removed from the game and cannot be re-opened.

#### Re-opening a Shut-Down Warehouse

- Owner may re-open their shut-down warehouse if their ship is in the city.
- Free action during player’s turn.
- Remove warehouse from center and place it at the end of the active chain.
- **Cannot build a new warehouse or fortress** in the same turn.
- Re-opening resets the "3 in a row" count.

#### Building Backwards

- Only after the **last possible building site** (second-to-last on U-track) is occupied.
- Then, previously unoccupied sites (due to shut-downs) can be rebuilt.
- Building proceeds backward toward the start of the chain.
- "o"-space becomes the final site to be built.
- "3 in a row" rule still applies.

#### Taking a Loan

- Must sail to **bank harbor** (free movement, no card needed).
- Take one loan card (10 or 16 Florin) and receive cash from bank.
- Loan card placed face up in front of player.
- **Must take a loan if unable or unwilling to build.**
- Loans cannot be taken in the first round.
- Multiple loans allowed over time.

**Loan Terms:**
| Loan | Repay Now | Repay After Extension |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| 10 Florin | 12 Florin | 16 Florin |
| 16 Florin | 20 Florin | 30 Florin |

- Can extend loan once (flip card), increasing repayment.
- After extension, **must repay next payday**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Payday (after each phase)

All players receive income for:

**1. Proliferation (presence in cities):**

- Based on number of cities with **at least one active warehouse**.
- Use proliferation chart:

| Cities | Payment |
|--------|---------|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 5 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 15 |
| 6 | 20 |
| 7 | 30 |
| 8 | 40 |
| 9+ | 60 |

- With expansion:
  - 10 cities: 75 Florin
  - 11 cities: 90 Florin
  - 12 cities: 110 Florin

- Shut-down warehouses do **not** count.
- Fortresses do **not** count.

**2. Proliferation Bonus Cards:**

- Awarded immediately when a player places their **first warehouse in the 9th city**.
  - 1st player: 15 Florin card
  - 2nd: 10 Florin
  - 3rd: 5 Florin
- Cards held until **third payday**, then paid.
- Player keeps bonus even if later loses presence in a city.

**3. Majority (per city):**

- Score only on **U-track spaces** (shut-down warehouses ignored).
- Top two players paid:
  - 1st: amount on **next free space** to the right
  - 2nd: **half** of that amount, rounded down
- Tiebreaker: player whose **first warehouse comes earliest** in chain ranks higher.

**4. Fortresses:**

- Paid based on **majority payouts in that city**:
  - If city has **highest warehouse count** (or tied), fortress pays **first-rank amount**.
  - Otherwise, fortress pays **second-rank amount**.
- Example: If 1st place gets 20, 2nd gets 10 → fortress pays 20 if city is top; 10 otherwise.

#### After Payday

1. **Loan Management:**
   - Players, in turn order, choose to:
     - Repay loan (return card, pay amount)
     - Extend loan (flip card, higher repayment next time)
   - Must repay after extension.
2. **Money Check:**
   - All players reveal total money minus unpaid loan obligations.
   - Openly declare net worth.
3. **Next Starting Player:**
   - Player with **least money** chooses who starts next phase.
   - "El Capitan" token given to selected player.
4. **Refill Components:**
   - Each player takes:
     - 6 new warehouses
     - 1 new fortress
     - (2-player game: also 2 neutral warehouses)

#### End of Game

- Ends after **third payday**.
- All loans **must be repaid**.
- Proliferation bonus cards are paid out.
- Player with **most money** wins.
