## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Mystery Express*, players are detectives aboard a luxury train traveling from Paris to Istanbul. A murder occurs en route, and players must deduce the five elements of the crime:  
- The victim  
- The murderer  
- The method  
- The motive  
- The location  

The objective is to correctly identify all five elements in your final conclusion. Players gather clues through card exchanges, timed reveals, and strategic observation during the train’s journey across five cities.

2. Components  
- 5 Crime cards (hidden at start): Victim, Murderer, Method, Motive, Location  
- Suspect cards (including: Sir Edmund, Prof. Karlov, O’Rourke, Sra. Pérez, Dr. Rajiv, Candy)  
- Method cards (including: Clubbed, Hanged, Poisoned, Pushed, Shot, Stabbed)  
- Motive cards (including: Despair, Greed, Jealousy, Money, Rivalry, Unknown)  
- Location cards (including: Club Car, Dining Car, Lounge Car, Passenger Car, Sleeping Car, Smoking Car)  
- Time cards (used during Hour of the Crime phases)  
- Conductor token  
- Passenger tokens (2)  
- Whistle (first-player marker, passed counter-clockwise)  
- Telegram sheets for recording guesses  
- Deduction sheets for tracking clues  

3. Setup  
- At the beginning of the game, one player secretly selects one card from each of the five categories (Victim, Murderer, Method, Motive, Location) to form the hidden solution. These are placed face-down and not revealed until Istanbul.  
- Remaining cards are shuffled into separate decks by category.  
- Each player is dealt a hand of cards from the remaining pool (exact number depends on player count).  
- The conductor token is placed on the first city (Strasbourg).  
- The whistle (first-player marker) is given to a starting player.  
- Two passenger tokens are placed off the board (used later).  
- Deduction and telegram sheets are distributed to players.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game progresses as the train arrives at five cities in order:  
- Strasbourg  
- München  
- Wien  
- Budapest  
- Istanbul  

At each city (except Istanbul), players perform a series of phase-specific actions. Turn order proceeds clockwise, but the whistle (first-player marker) passes counter-clockwise after each arrival.

**Strasbourg Arrival**  
1. All players retrieve their discarded cards into hand.  
2. **Strasbourg Hour of the Crime**: First player flips all Time cards into a single stack (face-up).  
3. Move first passenger token to Club Car.  
4. Move conductor token to next city (München).  
5. Pass whistle counter-clockwise.

**München Arrival**  
1. All players retrieve their discarded cards into hand.  
2. **A Long Tunnel**: Each player peeks at one card from each adjacent player’s hand (left and right neighbors). No discards.  
3. Move conductor token to Wien.  
4. Pass whistle counter-clockwise.

**Wien Arrival**  
1. All players retrieve their discarded cards into hand.  
2. **Wien Hour of the Crime**: First player deals Time cards into hands.  
   - First player signals: “Look!” — players view their Time cards.  
   - “Stop looking!” — players place hands face-down.  
   - “Pass left!” — hands are passed.  
   - Repeat until all players have seen all Time cards.  
3. Move second passenger token to Club Car.  
4. Move conductor token to Budapest.  
5. Pass whistle counter-clockwise.

**Budapest Arrival**  
1. All players retrieve their discarded cards into hand.  
2. **Budapest Hour of the Crime**: First player flips Time cards into **three stacks** (face-up).  
3. **An Important Wire**: Players secretly record one telegram guess each (a single card they believe is part of the solution).  
4. **A Sudden Revelation**: Each player reveals **one card** from their hand face-up. This card remains visible for the rest of the game.  
5. Move conductor token to Istanbul.  
6. Pass whistle counter-clockwise.

**Istanbul Arrival**  
1. Players write down their **final conclusion** — one card in each of the five categories.  
2. The five hidden Crime cards are revealed.  
3. Compare each player’s final conclusion to the true solution:  
   - Correct guesses score points.  
   - Incorrect final conclusions do **not** penalize.  
4. **Tiebreaker**: Among tied players, evaluate telegram guesses:  
   - Wrong telegram guesses count as **-1 point**.  
   - Correct telegram guesses add no extra points but avoid penalty.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Card Deduction**: Players use logical elimination based on cards they see, hold, or infer.  
- **Controlled Information Flow**:  
  - Time cards are revealed in structured ways (single stack, passing hands, three stacks).  
  - Limited peeks (München) and full hand rotation (Wien) allow progressive deduction.  
- **Visible Information**: After Budapest, each player reveals one card, helping others eliminate possibilities.  
- **Blind Guessing with Risk**: Telegram guesses are secret and only matter in ties — but wrong guesses hurt.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends upon arrival in Istanbul.  
- Players score 1 point per correct element in their final conclusion (max 5).  
- Final conclusions with incorrect elements are not penalized — only correct answers count.  
- In case of a tie:  
  - Compare players’ telegram guesses.  
  - Each incorrect telegram guess = **-1 point**.  
  - Player with highest adjusted score wins.  
  - If still tied, players share victory.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I guess a card I revealed during A Sudden Revelation?**  
  Yes, but if it’s incorrect, it confirms to others it’s not in the solution.  
- **What if I have no cards to reveal in A Sudden Revelation?**  
  Not possible — players retrieve discarded cards before this phase.  
- **Can I change my telegram guess after submitting?**  
  No — guesses are final once submitted.  
- **Are the Time cards part of the solution?**  
  No — Time cards are only used as tools for controlled information sharing and do not represent solution elements.  
- **What happens if all players get zero correct?**  
  The game ends in a draw unless telegram guesses break the tie (with negative scoring).
