## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the roles of high priests competing to advance their culture on a distant world by developing land, building temples and city structures, harnessing the power of the sun god Ahau, and activating powerful characters. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VP) through strategic expansion, resource management, and end-game scoring.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Action Tiles**: Sort 48 action tiles by symbol into 3 face-down stacks. Reveal 6 tiles from each stack to form 3 columns of 6 face-up tiles (18 total).  
2. **General Supply**: Place VP tokens, raw materials, mana stones, and temples/city buildings in shared supply.  
3. **Character Tiles**: Sort 8 character tiles by type into 4 face-up stacks.  
4. **Player Setup**: Each player receives:  
   - 1 player board, 1 city board, 1 summary card  
   - 1 sun marker → placed on "2" of sun track  
   - 1 sun disc → placed on center land tile with sun symbol  
   - 1 mana stone → placed in mana storage  
   - 1 victory point bag  
5. **Starting Player**: Player who has traveled to the most continents becomes starting player and takes dragon token.  
6. **Land Tiles**:  
   - Sort land tiles by color.  
   - Each player chooses 1 starting tile (brown, gray, or green), places it in center of player board, and adds matching raw material cube.  
   - Create 5 stacks of 4 face-down land tiles (one per color).  
   - Remaining tiles form one “additional stack” (6th stack).  
   - Reveal top tile from each of the 6 stacks; place matching raw material cube on each.  
7. **Special Tiles**: Sort 8 special tiles into 4 face-up stacks.  
8. **Bonus Resources**: Players in 3rd and 4th position (clockwise from start) take 1 additional raw material cube (not matching center tile color) and place on starting land.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has 3 phases:  
- **Phase 1: 4 Action Turns** (6 turns in 3-player)

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Phase 1: The 4 Action Turns  
- Players take turns clockwise starting with the start player.  
- On a turn, a player selects **one face-up action tile** from the **bottom of any of the 3 columns**.  
- Tile is placed under player board in space matching its **color** (red, blue, yellow).  
- Gray tiles are wild and can go under any colored space.  
- Player then performs the action shown on the tile:  

**1. Create One Land**  
- Take any **face-up land tile** (with its raw material cube) or **face-up special tile**.  
- Place on **light gray hex field** of player board adjacent to an existing tile.  
- Cannot place on **orange edge fields**.  
- Cannot place if doing so would **enclose the sun**.  
- Cannot place on a space occupied by the sun.  
- **Special Tile Placement**: Always remains face-up; no new tile revealed when taken.  
- **Bonus Fields**:  
  - **Bonus Raw Materials Field**: Receive 1 raw material cube (any color except tile’s base color).  
  - **Bonus Mana Stones Field**: Receive 2 mana stones.  
  - **Bonus Edge Field**: Scored during final scoring (4 VP, or 8 VP with Explorer).  

**2. Construct One Temple or City Building**  
- Take one white building from supply.  

**A. Temple (on Player Board)**  
- Place on any land or special tile.  
- **Cost**: 1 cube for 1st temple, 2 for 2nd, 3 for 3rd, etc. (any color).  
- Cannot build on a tile with a raw material cube unless cube is removed first.  
- Only one temple per tile.  
- **Reward**: Gain **N mana stones**, where N = number of temples now on board (1st = 1, 2nd = 2, etc.).  

**B. City Building (on City Board)**  
- Pay exact raw materials shown (white cube = any color).  
- If missing a required color, pay **2 cubes of any other color(s)** instead.  
- Place building token over cost to mark construction.  
- **Immediate Benefits**:  
  - Move sun marker forward (if indicated).  
  - Gain mana stones (if indicated).  
  - Trigger one-time ability (e.g., bonus action for Palace).  
- **End-game VP**: Score printed value during final scoring.  

**3. Move the Sun**  
- Move sun disc **clockwise** along empty hex fields adjacent to land/special tiles.  
- Must move **at least 1 space**, up to current sun track value.  
- May move through **orange edge fields**.  
- **Illumination**: At end of movement, sun illuminates adjacent tiles.  

**Rewards**:  
- **Empty Land Tile**: Gain 1 raw material cube of matching color.  
  - Exception: **Warehouse** allows second cube if one already present.  
- **Temple**: Gain 1 VP + 1 VP for each adjacent tile (max 6 VP).  
- **Special Tile**: No immediate reward.  

**Full Orbit**:  
- If sun passes over **gold-outlined fields** during movement, gain **5 VP** (once per turn).  
- Exception: **Power Plant** disables this bonus.  

**Shortcuts & Dead Ends**:  
- **Shortcuts**: Allowed; sun may take any valid adjacent path.  
- **Dead End**: A space with only one exit. Sun **cannot be moved into** a dead end.  
- If sun is trapped in a dead end, must move it out on next “move sun” action.  

**Passing**:  
- A player may **pass** (take no action) but may still take an action tile.  

**Bonus Actions**:  
- Earned when:  
  1. Player places **4 action tiles of the same color** (gray tiles count as wild) under player board.  
  2. Constructing **Palace** city building (grants one-time bonus action).  
- Bonus action: Choose **any one** of the three actions immediately.  
- No tile taken.  
- 4 matching tiles are discarded after bonus action.  

**End of Phase 1**:  
- **4 players**: After 4 turns each → discard 2 remaining action tiles.  
- **3 players**: After 6 turns each → all 18 tiles taken; no discard.  
- **2 players**:  
  - Rounds 1 & 3: 4 turns each → 10 tiles remain for next round.  
  - Round 2: Play with 10 tiles; discard 2, then replenish 18 for Round 3.

#### Phase 2: The Character Tiles  
- Turn order: Player with **most mana stones** (tie: clockwise from start player).  
- On turn, player may:  
  - **Purchase 1 character tile** (pay mana cost), placing it **night side up**.  
    - Costs: 2–4 mana stones.  
  - **Activate any number of owned characters** (pay raw material cost).  
    - All cost 3 raw materials (white cube = any color; missing color → pay 2 of other).  
    - Flip to **day side** to indicate activation.  
    - Gain immediate benefits (sun movement, mana).  
- Players may alternate purchase and activation.  
- Play continues until all pass.
