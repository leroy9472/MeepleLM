## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Players take on the roles of characters from *The Binding of Isaac* universe, battling monsters, collecting loot and items, and gaining souls. The objective is to be the first player to collect 4 souls and win the game. Souls are earned primarily by defeating boss monsters, though alternate paths exist via special cards and bonus souls.

### 2. Components
- 11 Character Cards (base game)
- 10 Starting Items (base game)
- 104 Loot Cards
- 105 Treasure Cards
- 107 Monster Cards
- 3 Bonus Souls (Soul of Greed, Soul of Gluttony, Soul of Guppy)
- 100 Pennies (currency, denoted as c)
- 1 D6 and 1 D8

*Note: Kickstarter and other editions may include fewer or additional components.*

### 3. Setup
1. Shuffle the Treasure, Loot, and Monster decks. Place 100c in the supply.
2. Reveal 2 Treasure Cards face-up next to the Treasure deck — these are the shop items.
3. Reveal 2 Monster Cards face-up next to the Monster deck — these occupy active monster slots.
   - If a non-monster card (Bonus or Curse) is revealed during setup, place it on the bottom of the deck.
4. If using Bonus Souls, place them face-up beside the play area.
5. Shuffle the Character deck and deal one Character Card and its Starting Item to each player.
6. All players begin with:
   - Character card deactivated (turned sideways)
   - Starting item recharged (upright)
   - 3 Loot Cards in hand
   - 3c
7. The first player is Cain. If Cain is not in play, the saddest player goes first.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn follows a strict structure divided into three phases:

#### Starting Phase
1. Recharge all items and your character card (turn upright).
2. Trigger “Start of Turn” effects.
3. “Loot 1” is placed on the stack; draw 1 Loot Card when it resolves.

#### Action Phase
The active player may perform the following any number of times and in any order:
- Play 1 Loot Card (activate character to play a second).
- Purchase 1 shop item or top card of Treasure deck for 10c (once per turn).
- Attack 1 active monster or top card of Monster deck (once per turn).

*Note: Purchasing and attacking cannot be done in response to stack actions.*

#### Ending Phase
1. Trigger “End of Turn” effects.
2. Heal all players and monsters to full health.
3. All “until end of turn” effects expire.
4. If holding more than 10 Loot Cards, discard down to 10.
5. Pass turn to the player on the left.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### The Stack
- Effects (loot cards, item activations, game events) go on the stack before resolving.
- Players respond by adding effects to the top of the stack.
- Stack resolves last-in, first-out.
- Game events using the stack: Purchasing, Dice Rolls, Attacking, Monster Death, Refilling, Player Death.

#### Priority
- Only one player has priority at a time.
- The player with priority may play effects, purchase, or attack.
- After playing an action, the player may keep priority or pass it.
- When all players pass in succession, the top stack element resolves.

#### Playing Effects
Three types of actions count as “playing an effect”:
- Playing a Loot Card
- Activating an item (turn sideways)
- Using a paid effect (pay cost; does not require activation)

#### Treasure Cards
- **Active Items (gold border):**
  - *Activated Effects:* Use by turning item sideways. Must recharge before reuse.
  - *Paid Effects:* Use by paying cost (symbol). Can be used while activated.
- **Passive Items (silver border):**
  - Provide continuous modifiers or trigger automatically under conditions.

#### Loot Cards
- Kept in hand until played.
- Three types:
  - **Basic Loot:** One-time effects (gain resources, damage, etc.)
  - **Tarot Cards:** Unique powerful effects, often global.
  - **Trinkets:** Played and remain in play as passive items.

#### Monster Cards
- **Basic Monsters:** Easier to kill, smaller rewards.
- **Bosses:** Harder to kill, always drop at least one soul. When killed, the boss card becomes a soul card for the active player.
- **Non-Monsters:**
  - *Bonus Cards:* Help or hinder active player.
  - *Curses:* Assign to a player; discarded upon death.

#### Monster Card Breakdown
- **Health:** Reduce to 0 to kill.
- **Evasion:** Target number to hit on D6.
- **Attack:** Damage dealt if attacker misses.
- **BAECACT:** Only effects on active monsters trigger.
- **Souls:** Number of souls awarded on death (bosses only).
- **Reward:** Loot, treasure, or other benefits gained when killed.

#### Attacking
1. Declare attack (goes on stack; must be empty stack).
2. If attacking top of Monster deck:
   - Reveal card.
   - If monster, place in slot and continue.
   - If non-monster, play it immediately; attack ends.
3. Roll D6 (see Dice Rolls).
4. Compare roll to monster’s evasion:
   - **Hit (≥ evasion):** Deal damage equal to player’s attack to monster.
   - **Miss (< evasion):** Take damage equal to monster’s attack.
5. Combat damage resolves; trigger damage-based effects.
6. Repeat steps 3–5 while both are alive.

*Forced attacks must be made at the next legal opportunity during Action Phase.*

#### Dice Rolls
- Initial roll placed on stack.
- Modifiers (e.g., +1 to rolls) go on stack above roll.
- Rerolls (e.g., Dice Shard) respond to roll.
- Final result determines hit/miss or effect.
- Rolls and evasion capped between 1 and 6.

#### Monster Death
1. Death trigger placed on stack.
2. Monster moved to stack; reward and on-death effects added.
3. Active player gains boss as soul card; basic monsters are discarded.
4. If slot is empty, trigger refill.

#### Player Death
1. Death trigger placed on stack.
2. Discard all curses; “The Death Penalty” placed on stack.
3. Death Penalty requires:
   - Discard 1 Loot Card
   - Lose 1c
   - Destroy 1 non-eternal item
   - Deactivate all items and character
   - End turn (if active player)
4. Player heals to full at next Ending Phase.
5. A player can only die once per turn.

#### Refilling
- Triggered when monster or shop slot becomes empty.
1. Refill effect placed on stack.
2. Reveal top card of deck:
   - Monster/Shop: Place in slot.
   - Non-monster: Active player plays it; repeat if slot still empty.
- If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.

#### Bartering
- Players may trade c for favors at any time.
- Cannot trade items or loot cards unless Enhanced Bartering variant is used.
- Promises do not need to be kept.
- Does not use the stack.

#### Fizzling
An effect is canceled (removed from stack without resolving) if:
- **Invalid Target:** Target leaves play or becomes untargetable.
- **Condition Not Met:** Trigger/resolution condition fails (e.g., Sacred Heart on roll ≠ 1).
- **Attack Fizzle:** Target monster leaves play before attack starts.
- **Purchase Fizzle:** Target item leaves shop or player lacks 10c when purchase resolves.
- **Leaving Combat:** Player or monster dies or leaves combat; attack rolls and damage fizzle.

#### Winning the Game
- Any card with a soul symbol can become a soul card.
- First player to control 4 souls wins immediately.

#### Bonus Souls
- Not in decks; placed face-up beside play area.
- Gained once per game; if discarded, placed face-down and cannot be regained.
  - **Soul of Greed:** First to have 25+ c.
  - **Soul of Gluttony:** First to have 10+ loot cards in hand.
  - **Soul of Guppy:** First to possess 2+ Guppy items.

#### Other Soul Acquisition Methods
- **The Lost:** Starts with 1 soul (cannot be lost).
- **The Bone:** Final paid effect turns it into a soul.
- **Pandora’s Box:** Activated effect with roll of 6 turns it into a soul.
- **The Chest:** Destroyed → becomes soul instead of discard.
- **Lost Soul:** Played as loot → becomes soul when resolves.
- **Holy Chest:** Roll of 6 on resolution → becomes soul.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Scoring:** Souls are the only victory condition.
- **Sources of Souls:**
  - Killing boss monsters.
  - Bonus Souls (Greed, Gluttony, Guppy).
  - Special cards (Lost Soul, The Bone, etc.).
- Game ends immediately when a player gains their 4th soul.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can you attack during another player’s turn?**  
  No, unless an effect forces you to. Forced attacks must be taken during your Action Phase.

- **Can you play multiple loot cards?**  
  Yes: 1 base + 1 extra if you activate your character card.

- **Do you get priority after an effect resolves?**  
  Yes, the active player typically gets priority after resolution and triggered effects.

- **What happens if a player dies during an attack?**  
  Combat ends immediately. Death Penalty resolves before turn continues.

- **Can you respond to a dice roll?**  
  Yes. Dice rolls go on the stack; effects like Dice Shard can respond.

- **Can you barter during combat?**  
  Yes, as bartering does not use the stack.

- **Can you win during another player’s turn?**  
  Yes, if you gain your 4th soul via triggered effect.
