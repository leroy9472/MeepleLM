## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Navigate your speedboat through a dynamically built water course, rounding buoys in the correct order and crossing the finish line as quickly as possible. Avoid crashing into land or buoys to minimize damage. Over three races, accumulate the most victory points to win.

### 2. Components  
- 6 lake tiles  
- 4 lake border tiles  
- 1 start/finish tile  
- 5 buoys (including buoy 0 and finish buoy with flag)  
- 6 speedboats (in 6 colors)  
- 18 custom dice (numbered 1–3)  
- 10 damage counters  
- 6 score markers  
- 1 score track  

### 3. Setup  
**Board Construction:**  
- Assemble the 4 long border tiles into a frame.  
- Randomly place the 6 lake tiles inside the frame. Use dark blue (standard) or light blue (expert) side.  
- Place buoys 0, 1, 2, and 3 on the designated A-spots (race 1), B-spots (race 2), or C-spots (race 3).  
- Place the start/finish tile so its arrows align with buoy 0. The finish buoy goes at the opposite end.  
- Arrows on buoys 1–3 must be oriented to avoid requiring full 360° turns when rounding them in sequence.  

**Player Setup:**  
- Each player takes a speedboat and places it on or behind the start line.  
- Placement order: Right-hand neighbor of start player goes first; others follow counter-clockwise (start player places last).  
- Boats must point toward a side of the hex, not a corner.  
- No two boats may occupy the same space.  
- All players start with 0 dice (speed = 0).  
- Determine start player randomly (first race); in subsequent races, the left neighbor of the previous start player begins.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise. Each turn has three phases:

#### 1. Roll Dice  
- **Adjust Dice Count:** Add 1 die, remove 1 die, or keep count unchanged (max ±1 per turn).  
- **Re-roll Selection:** Choose any number of existing dice to re-roll (including all or none).  
- Roll selected dice and any newly added die simultaneously.  
- Total = sum of all dice on your color area. This is your speed for movement.  

#### 2. Turn Your Speedboat  
- Before moving, rotate your boat 60° left or right.  
- You must choose a direction where you can move at least one space through water.  
- If all three directions (straight, left, right) lead to an immediate crash, choose the direction with the longest possible straight path through water.  
- If multiple directions have equal longest paths, choose one.  
- After movement, the boat remains pointing in the direction it moved.  

#### 3. Move Forward  
- Move your boat in a straight line in its current direction for a number of spaces equal to your total dice value.  
- Movement must be entirely through water hexes.  
- If blocked by land or a buoy, stop in the last reachable water hex.  
- **Passing Other Boats:** You may move through spaces occupied by other boats.  
- **Ending Movement:** If your intended final space is occupied, end in the last unoccupied space before it.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Damage  
- If you cannot complete your full movement due to a crash (into land or a buoy), you take damage.  
- Damage = (Total dice value) – (Number of spaces actually moved).  
- Place damage counters on your boat or in your dice area.  
- You lose all current dice (speed resets to 0).  
- If you accumulate **4 or more damage**, your boat sinks and is out of the race.  

#### Repair  
- At the beginning of any turn where you **do not add, remove, or re-roll any dice**, you may remove **1 damage counter**.  
- This simulates repairing during a "coast" turn.  
- You may still turn your boat (60°) even with 0 dice.  

#### Passing Buoys  
- To round a buoy, your path must pass on the correct side relative to the arrow (left or right).  
- Visualize your path as a string: if pulling it taut wraps around the buoy, it counts as rounded.  
- You do not need to be adjacent to the buoy; islands or other obstacles may lie between.  
- Buoys must be rounded in order: 1 → 2 → 3 → Finish.  

#### Finishing the Race  
- To finish, your boat must cross or land on the finish line **from the correct direction**, passing between both finish arrows.  
- Once a boat finishes, it is **immediately removed from the board**.  
- Crashing **after** crossing the finish still results in damage.  

#### Carrying Over Damage Between Races  
- After each race:  
  - All players retain **1 damage counter** for the next race (even if they had 0).  
  - Example: If you end race 1 with 2 damage, you start race 2 with 1 damage. If you take 3 damage in race 2, you start race 3 with 2 damage.  
- Sunk boats still carry over 1 damage.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Play **3 races**. Final winner is determined by total victory points.  

#### Victory Points per Race  
- Points scale by race:  
  - **Race 1:** Standard points  
  - **Race 2:** Double points  
  - **Race 3:** Triple points  
- Base points:  
  - 1st: (n–1) pts  
  - 2nd: (n–2) pts  
  - ...  
  - Last: 0 pts  
  - Where *n* = number of players  
- **Example (5 players):**  
  - Race 1: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0  
  - Race 2: 8, 6, 4, 2, 0  
  - Race 3: 12, 9, 6, 3, 0  

#### Tiebreaker  
- If tied after 3 races, finishing position in the **third race** breaks the tie.  

#### Optional 2-Player/Variant Scoring  
- **Extra Points:** Gain 1 VP for each turn you finish before the last player.  
- **Sunken Boats Bonus:** +5 VP for each opponent boat that sinks (only if you finished).  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I turn 120°?** No. Only 60° left or right per turn.  
- **Can I re-roll dice more than once?** No. Only once per turn.  
- **Can I add/remove more than one die?** No. Max ±1 die per turn.  
- **Can I keep speed unchanged?** Yes. Keep dice count, re-roll none, and do not add/remove.  
- **Can I crash on purpose?** Only if all movement directions lead to a crash. Then take the longest path (minimal damage).  
- **Can I have more than 5 dice?** Yes. Though the board has only 5 spots, you may exceed this (rare).  
- **Can I go to 0 dice?** Yes. Even with 0 dice, you may turn 60°.  
- **Can boats finish from any direction?** No. Must pass between both finish arrows in the correct direction.  
- **Do boats stay on board after finishing?** No. Removed immediately.  
- **Can I drop any die?** Yes. No order required when removing dice.  
- **Can I re-roll only some dice?** Yes. Choose freely which to re-roll.
