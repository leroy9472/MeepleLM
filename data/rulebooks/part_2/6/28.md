# Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
The object of Illuminati is to take control of the world through secret conspiracy. Each player controls one of eight Illuminati groups, each with unique powers and special victory conditions. The game ends when a player fulfills either the basic goal (controlling a set number of groups) or their Illuminati’s special goal.

**Anonymous Special Rules:**  
At the beginning of your turn, you must copy one of the Illuminati card powers currently in play.  
- **POWER:** 1/12* – You may use your transferable power on your own Illuminati card, adding to your power. This value can be divided between two attacks within your power structure.  
- **INCOME:** $0* – Your income equals that of the Illuminati card you are copying.  
- **OBJECTIVE:** You must control, destroy, or neutralize one group of each alignment. You must choose one such group at the beginning of the game.

### 2. Components
- 8 Illuminati cards  
- 83 Group cards  
- 15 Special cards  
- 4 blank cards  
- 160 money tokens (Megabucks, or MB)  
- 2 six-sided dice  

### 3. Setup
1. Each player draws one random Illuminati card and places it face-up.  
2. Each player collects the income shown on their Illuminati card.  
3. Shuffle all remaining cards (Groups and Specials) and place them face-down as a draw deck.  
4. Reveal 4 Group cards face-up into the center of the table (uncontrolled area). Replace any Specials drawn.  
5. Determine turn order by dice roll (highest goes first). Play proceeds counter-clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On a player’s turn, follow this sequence:
1. **Collect Income** – Each controlled Group collects its listed Income. Place MB directly on the card.  
2. **Draw a Card** – Draw the top card:  
   - If **Group**, place it face-up in the uncontrolled area.  
   - If **Special**, keep it (face-up or face-down).  
3. **Take Two Actions** – Choose from:  
   - Attack (to control, neutralize, or destroy)  
   - Transfer money (to adjacent Group)  
   - Move a Group (and its puppets)  
   - Give away a Group  
4. **Take Free Actions** – Any number, in any order:  
   - Drop a Group (and its puppets)  
   - Give money or Special cards (only between Illuminati)  
   - Use a Special card (except Bribery, which is a regular action)  
5. **Transfer Money (Twice)** – Move money between adjacent Groups (up to two transfers).  
6. **Special Power Actions** – Use Illuminati-specific powers (e.g., Gnomes of Zurich redistribute money, Bermuda Triangle reorganizes structure).

**Passing:** A player may forfeit all actions (including free actions) and gain $5 MB.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Power Structure
- The Illuminati card is the center.  
- Groups are added as puppets via matching outward and inward arrows.  
- Arrows may be blocked by overlapping cards.  
- Puppets retain their own puppets unless overlap forces removal.

#### Alignments
- Government ↔ Communist  
- Liberal ↔ Conservative  
- Peaceful ↔ Violent  
- Straight ↔ Weird  
- Criminal – no opposite  
- Fanatic – all Fanatics are opposite to each other  

#### Power & Resistance
- **Power**: Determines attack strength. Some cards have transferable power (e.g., 7/4: 7 total, 4 transferable).  
- **Resistance**: Defense value for control/neutralize attacks. Lower = easier to control.  
- Illuminati have no Resistance and cannot be attacked.

#### Attacks
Each Group may attack only once per turn (UFOs may attack twice).  
To attack:
1. Announce attacker, defender, and attack type.  
2. Calculate target number:  
   - **Control/Neutralize**: (Attacker Power + modifiers) – Defender Resistance  
   - **Destroy**: (Attacker Power + modifiers) – Defender Power  
3. Roll 2d6. Must roll ≤ target number. Rolls of 11 or 12 always fail.

**Modifiers:**
- **Alignment**: +4 for same, -4 for opposite (Control/Neutralize); reversed for Destroy  
- **Money Spent**:  
  - +1 per MB from attacker (Illuminati or attacking Group)  
  - -2 per MB from defending Group  
  - -1 per MB from defender’s Illuminati  
- **Proximity Bonus (Resistance/Power)**:  
  - Controlled directly by Illuminati: +10  
  - 1 away: +5  
  - 2 away: +2  
- **Neutralize Bonus**: +6 to attacker  
- **Special Powers**: Apply as described

**Attack Types:**
- **Control**: Attacker must have free outward arrow. On success, target becomes puppet. Half money (round down) transfers; attacker may make free money transfer.  
- **Neutralize**: Target must be controlled. On success, target and puppets become uncontrolled; all money lost.  
- **Destroy**: No arrow needed. On success, target is destroyed (dead pile); puppets become uncontrolled; all money lost. Groups with 0 Power cannot be destroyed (except via Whispering Campaign).

**Interference:**
- Any player may spend MB from their Illuminati to:  
  - Assist attacker: +1 per MB  
  - Interfere: -1 per MB  
- **Privileged Attack**: Discard one Special card to prevent interference. Can be countered by discarding two Specials.

**Calling Off Attacks:**  
Attack may be canceled until first MB is spent or dice are rolled.

#### Money & Movement
- **Transfer Money**: As action or during money phase (twice). Move between adjacent Groups (master/puppet).  
- **Move Group**: Reorganize structure. Puppets move with it. Overlaps may cause loss.  
- **Drop Group**: Free action. Group and puppets become uncontrolled.

#### Special Cards
- Kept face-up or face-down; others may count how many you have.  
- Used once, then discarded.  
- May be traded, sold, or given away (free action).  
- Some (e.g., Bribery) are regular actions.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends when a player meets a victory condition at the end of any turn.

**Basic Goal (All Players):**  
Control the following number of Groups (including Illuminati):  
- 2–3 players: 13  
- 4 players: 12  
- 5 players: 10  
- 6 players: 9  
- 7+ players: 8  

**Special Goals:**
- **Bavarian Illuminati**: Control Groups with total Power ≥ 35 (including own 10).  
- **Bermuda Triangle**: Control at least one Group of each of the 10 alignments (multi-alignment Groups count for each).  
- **Discordian Society**: Control 5 Weird Groups.  
- **Gnomes of Zurich**: Accumulate 150 MB across all treasuries.  
- **Network**: Control Groups with total Transferable Power ≥ 25 (including own 7).  
- **Servants of Cthulhu**: Destroy 8 Groups (eliminating a player counts as one).  
- **Society of Assassins**: Control 6 Violent Groups.  
- **UFOs**: Secretly choose one of the above special goals at game start.  
- **Anonymous**: Control, destroy, or neutralize one group of each alignment (chosen at start).

**Winning:**  
- If multiple players win simultaneously, they share victory.  
- No player may intentionally let another win unless they also win.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a Group aid an attack and attack itself?** No. Aiding uses a Group’s transferable power and counts as its action.  
- **Can I attack my own Group?** Yes, to neutralize or destroy. Destroying own Group ignores proximity bonus.  
- **What happens to puppets when master is moved or captured?** They move with the master. If overlap occurs, rearrange or drop.  
- **Can I transfer money from a puppet to a non-adjacent Group?** Only via multiple transfers (one per turn phase).  
- **Are promises binding?** Only if exchange happens immediately. Future promises are not binding.  
- **Elimination:** A player is eliminated if, after their third turn, they control no Groups except their Illuminati.  
- **Cheating Variant:** Permitted with house rules, but not official.
