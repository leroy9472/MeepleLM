## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Curse of the Wolfen*, a group of plane crash survivors are stranded on an island, only to discover that one or more among them are Wolfen—beings who transform at night and kill. The Humans must identify and execute the Wolfen during the day, while the Wolfen attempt to eliminate all Humans or reach parity in numbers. A neutral Storyteller oversees the game. The goal is for either the Humans or the Wolfen to achieve victory through elimination or strategic deception.

2. Components  
- Role cards (or substitutes):  
  - Wolfen (4): Alpha (α), Beta (β), Delta (δ), Gamma (γ)  
  - Normal Humans (9): Athlete, Doctor, Gambler, Inventor, Photographer, Pilot, Programmer, Soldier, Student  
  - Special Humans (9): Half-Blood, Wolfsbane, Priest, Occultist, Romantic, Magus, Lunatic, Troublemaker, Werehamster  
  - Psychic (1)  
  - Storyteller (1)  
- 48 voting tokens (24 red, 24 blue)  
- 24 accusation tokens (white)  
- Hat or container for token draws (optional)  

3. Setup  
- Determine player count (minimum 6, ideal 10+).  
- Create a deck with:  
  - 1 Storyteller card  
  - 1 Psychic card  
  - Wolfen cards based on player count:  
    - 6 players: 1 (Alpha)  
    - 7–12: 2 (Alpha, Beta)  
    - 13–18: 3 (Alpha, Beta, Delta)  
    - 19+: 4 (all)  
  - Remaining cards: Normal and/or Special Humans to match player count. Replace half the Normal Humans (rounded down) with Special Humans if used.  
- Shuffle and deal one card to each player face-down.  
- The player with the Storyteller card reveals it and becomes the moderator. All others keep roles secret.  
- Distribute tokens: 1 red, 1 blue, and 1 white (accusation) token per player.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each game cycle consists of alternating Nights and Days.

**First Night:**  
- All players close eyes.  
- Storyteller calls each role in sequence (e.g., "Psychic, awaken").  
- Roles open eyes, make eye contact, then return to sleep.  
- Special roles make initial choices (e.g., Romantic chooses Lover, Lunatic picks faction).  
- Storyteller learns all identities.  
- Storyteller is automatically killed.

**Subsequent Nights:**  
- All players close eyes.  
- Roles awaken in sequence:  
  1. Psychic: Points to a player; Storyteller signals thumbs-up (Wolfen) or down (Human).  
  2. Magus: May use protective blessing (saves all) or jinx (kills one). Each spell once per game.  
  3. Priest: Points to one player to protect (cannot self-protect).  
  4. Occultist: Learns if last executed player was Wolfen.  
  5. Romantic: Confirmed with Lover (no action after first night).  
  6. Troublemaker: Points to a player to force as nominee next day.  
  7. Lunatic: Points to a player to kill (optional).  
  8. Wolfen: Awaken, silently agree on victim. If no consensus, highest-ranking Wolfen (Alpha > Beta > Delta > Gamma) decides.  
- Storyteller confirms victim.  
- If Magus blessing used, no deaths.  
- If Werehamster chosen by Psychic and not protected, dies.  

**Day Phase:**  
- Storyteller announces deaths (Wolfen victim, plus Lunatic/Magus victims if applicable).  
- Dead players become Ghosts (keep accusation token, lose voting tokens).  
- Discussion (1 minute per surviving player).  
- Accusation round: Each player gives white token to suspected Wolfen.  
- Top two accusers become nominees. Ties broken via hat draw with white tokens.  
- If one player receives all accusations, executed immediately.  
- Otherwise, nominees give brief defense.  
- Execution vote:  
  - Nominees display red and blue tokens.  
  - Survivors vote secretly with matching color token.  
  - Majority wins. Tie: repeat vote. If still tied, Storyteller draws randomly.  
- Executed player becomes Ghost.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Ghosts:** Dead players may speak and cast accusation tokens but not vote in executions.  
- **Suicide:** Revealing role ends current phase. Player is removed, no Ghost status.  
- **Role Abilities:**  
  - **Psychic:** Discovers if one player per night is Wolfen.  
  - **Magus:** One protective blessing (saves all), one jinx (kills one).  
  - **Priest:** Protects one player per night (not self).  
  - **Occultist:** Learns if last executed was Wolfen.  
  - **Romantic:** Bound to Lover; cannot accuse or vote for each other.  
  - **Troublemaker:** Can force a nominee.  
  - **Lunatic:** Can kill one per night; wins with chosen faction.  
  - **Werehamster:** Cannot be killed by Wolfen/Lunatic; if seen by Psychic, dies unless protected. Wins alone if alive at end.  
  - **Wolfsbane:** Immune to Wolfen/Magus kills.  
  - **Half-Blood:** Wins with Wolfen.  
- **Wolfen Hierarchy:** Alpha > Beta > Delta > Gamma for tie-breaking.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Human Victory:** All Wolfen eliminated.  
- **Wolfen Victory:** Wolfen count ≥ Human count.  
- **Werehamster Victory:** If alive when game ends, wins alone.  
- **Faction Wins:** All members of winning faction win, including dead.  
- **Tournament Scoring (Optional):**  
  - Winning faction: 3 points  
  - Losing faction: 1 point  
  - Storyteller: 2 points  
  - Bonus: 1 point each for best role-player and most fun player (voted via red/blue tokens).  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can Wolfen kill each other?** Yes, with majority agreement.  
- **What if no one dies at night?** Storyteller announces no deaths; game continues.  
- **Can Psychic target Werehamster?** Yes, but dies unless protected.  
- **Does Priest protection stop Lunatic?** No.  
- **Can Romantic choose a dead player?** No—only living players.  
- **What if Storyteller makes a mistake?** Minimize impact; restart if game is compromised.  
- **Cheating:** Peeking or revealing role = Suicide; immediate removal.
