## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
We the People is a two-player historical wargame simulating the American Revolutionary War. One player controls the American revolutionaries; the other controls the British forces. The objective is to gain political control of colonies and achieve victory through superior political and military dominance by the end of the game. Victory is determined by control of colonies and Canada, with tiebreakers favoring the American player in certain cases.

2. Components  
- Game board depicting colonies, key cities, and movement routes  
- Combat Units (CUs) for American, British, and French forces  
- General pieces with individual battle ratings and special abilities  
- Political Control (PC) markers (American and British)  
- Strategy Deck containing Operations, Campaign, Event, and Battle cards  
- Ten-sided die (d10) for combat resolution  
- Six-sided die (d6) for casualty determination  
- Colony Control Track for tracking victory status  
- Status Record sheet (optional for tracking game state)  

3. Setup  
- Place the board and Colony Control Track.  
- Each player places starting CUs and Generals in designated spaces (e.g., American forces in Boston, British in New York).  
- Place initial PC markers per scenario setup.  
- Shuffle the Strategy Deck and deal 5 cards to each player.  
- Place remaining cards in a draw pile; create a discard pile.  
- French forces enter only after the French Alliance event occurs.  
- Set winter attrition marker if using expansion rules.

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game proceeds in turns, each representing a season. A turn consists of the following phases:  
1. **Strategy Phase**:  
   - Players alternate playing one card per turn from their hand.  
   - Cards may be Operations, Campaign, Event, or Battle cards.  
   - Effects are resolved immediately unless stated otherwise.  
   - Players draw back to 5 cards at end of turn.  
2. **Movement & Combat**:  
   - Movement occurs via Operations or Campaign cards.  
   - Intercepts may be attempted by American Generals when British move.  
   - Battles occur when opposing forces occupy the same space.  
3. **Political Control Phase**:  
   - Convert PC markers based on General presence and control rules.  
   - Check isolation status using Go-like rules (see Core Mechanics).  
4. **Winter Attrition (Winter Turns Only)**:  
   - Any CU without a General above the winter attrition line must roll a d6:  
     - 4–6: eliminated.  
   - Only one such unit is checked per side per winter.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Operations & Campaign Cards**:  
  - Operations cards allow movement of one General and attached CUs.  
  - Minor Campaign: move two Generals.  
  - Major Campaign: move three Generals.  
- **Interception**:  
  - American Generals may intercept during British movement.  
  - One intercept attempt per Strategy card played.  
  - Success triggers immediate battle; failed attempt allows movement to continue.  
  - Attempting an intercept forfeits Retreat Before Combat for that General.  
- **Retreat Before Combat**:  
  - American armies may retreat before battle if not intercepted.  
  - Only one retreat attempt per army per card play.  
  - Once a retreat is attempted (successful or not), no further retreats or intercepts occur.  
- **Political Control (PC)**:  
  - A space is controlled by the player with a PC marker, provided it is not politically isolated.  
  - Isolation follows Go-like rules: a PC marker is removed if it is completely surrounded by enemy-controlled spaces with no path to a friendly-controlled space.  
  - American Generals convert British PC markers to American if:  
    - No British piece is present.  
    - Continental Congress is not dispersed.  
    - Exception: Continental Line Mutiny does not prevent conversion.  
  - British may place PC markers in spaces they control, unless restricted.  
- **Combat**:  
  - Triggered when opposing forces occupy the same space.  
  - Each side plays Battle Cards from hand.  
  - Battle Card totals determine combat strength.  
  - Combat Results Table (CRT):  
    - Cross-reference attacker and defender Battle Card totals.  
    - Die roll (d10) must meet or exceed target number.  
    - Attacker wins on 10, loses on 1.  
    - Automatic wins:  
      - Defender has 1 Battle Card total.  
      - Attacker outnumbers defender and defender has no General.  
    - Modifiers:  
      - +1 if defending General has Battle Rating 1.  
      - –1 if defending General has Battle Rating 3.  
  - Casualties:  
    - Roll d6: 1–3 = 1 casualty, 4–5 = 2, 6 = 3.  
    - Attacker chooses which CUs are removed.  
    - Defender removes their own CUs.  
- **Retreat After Combat**:  
  - Losing side retreats.  
  - British may retreat by sea only from a port they were defending (not retreated into).  
  - Retreat paths must be to adjacent friendly-controlled or empty spaces.  
  - French navy presence blocks British sea retreats.  
- **Reinforcements**:  
  - May be placed in spaces containing only an enemy General — that General is captured.  
  - Placement otherwise follows control and adjacency rules.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends after a set number of turns (typically 1776–1783).  
- Victory determined by Colony Control Track:  
  - Player with most controlled colonies wins.  
  - Ties in colony count favor the American player.  
- Canada:  
  - Controlled only if a player holds both Montreal and Quebec.  
  - Detroit counts toward militia strength but not control.  
  - If Americans control one of Montreal/Quebec and British the other, British control Canada.  
  - In case of PC tie in Canada, Americans do not automatically win — both cities must be held.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can Nathan Hale, Jane McCrea, or Thomas Paine convert British PC in a space with an American General?**  
  No. These cards require the space to have no British piece — American General presence does not override this.  
- **Can Declaration of Independence place American PC in a space with a British General?**  
  No. It allows placement only where possible — cannot place in enemy-occupied spaces.  
- **European War Card**:  
  - If played before French Alliance: reshuffles entire deck (including discards).  
  - Two British CUs removed by the player who played the card.  
  - Does not trigger other card effects (e.g., Don Bernardo Galvez).  
- **Benedict Arnold Card**:  
  - May only be played prior to a battle.  
  - Grants two extra Battle Cards.  
  - Benedict Arnold is removed immediately upon play, even if not present.  
- **John Glover Marblehead Regiment**:  
  - Not an activation card.  
  - Used with an Operations or Campaign card to give +1 movement to one General.  
- **Rochambeau**:  
  - Treated as American General in all ways: eligible for interception, retreat before combat.  
  - British receive Regulars bonus against him.  
- **Multiple Intercepts**:  
  - Only one intercept attempt per American General per Strategy card.  
  - First successful intercept triggers battle, halting further intercepts.  
- **Winter Attrition (Expansion Rule)**:  
  - One CU without a General above winter line must roll d6 (4–6 = eliminated).  
  - Only one such unit checked per side per winter.
