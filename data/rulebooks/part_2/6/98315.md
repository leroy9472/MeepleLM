### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in 6 phases:  

#### **Phase 1: Adjust Wound and Load Level (WLL)**  
- Discard any treasures if desired.  
- Count total **Treasure + Wound cards** (maximum 12). This is your **Wound and Load Level (WLL)**.  
- Slide down your adventurer card to indicate current WLL.  

#### **Phase 2: Determine Number of Actions**  
- The first player rolls 5 dice.  
- Each die result **≥ your WLL** grants 1 action.  
- Slide up your adventurer card to show number of actions.  

#### **Phase 3: Perform Actions**  
Players take turns in clockwise order. On your turn, spend actions to:  

- **Move (1 action)**: Move to any adjacent space (no diagonals unless ability allows).  
- **Search (1 action)**: In Cobra Nest, Scorpion Pit, or Crocodile Pond — draw top card from corresponding deck.  
  - Treasure: keep face down  
  - Wound or Equipment: place face up  
  - May search same zone multiple times  
- **Open a Sarcophagus (1 action)**: Flip the card to reveal treasure (remains in place).  
- **Take a Treasure (1 action)**: Claim treasure from an open sarcophagus.  
- **Open an Alcove (1 action)**: Roll 5 dice; match exact combination shown. May re-roll once per action.  
- **Use Special Ability** (once per game, see below)  
- **Use Equipment** (see section below)  

> **The Mummy's Touch**: If on same space as a mummy, draw a Mummy Wound card. At 12 wounds, you are eliminated.  
>  
> **The Curse**: If you obtain an Idol, place it face up. When rolling for actions, **ignore the die** matching the color shown on the idol.  

#### **Phase 4: Move the Mummies**  
- First player rolls 5 dice.  
- Each mummy moves **1 space per die ≥ 4** in its corridor.  
- Mummies reverse direction at corridor ends (no action cost).  

#### **Phase 5: Place a Stone Block**  
- First player draws a random stone block tile.  
- Place it on the board space matching its number.  
- **If an adventurer is on that space**:  
  - Must immediately move to adjacent unoccupied space (non-diagonal)  
  - Draws a **Block Wound card**  
  - If no legal move, adventurer is **eliminated**  
- **Adventurers trapped by blocks (surrounded)** are eliminated.  

> **Clairvoyance & Udjat Note**: If a player used an Udjat card this round, **Clairvoyance cannot be used**.  

#### **Phase 6: Change First Player**  
- Pass the Ankh card and dice to the left.  
- That player becomes first player next round.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### **Wound and Load Level (WLL)**  
- Total of Treasure + Wound cards (max 12).  
- Determines number of actions (via dice roll).  
- Affects danger in certain actions (e.g., escaping river).  

#### **Special Abilities (One Use Per Game)**  
Each adventurer has a unique ability:  

- **Linguistics (Abdel Wahab)**: Look secretly at adjacent sarcophagus contents. No action cost. Must still use 1 action to open, 1 to take.  
- **Dodge (Chantal Sarti)**: Avoid Block Wound card when stone block falls on your space. **Must still move** to adjacent space.  
- **Shoot (David Gore)**: If adjacent to mummy, place it horizontally (neutralized). It stands up at start of **next** Phase 4 and wounds anyone in its space.  
- **Stamina (Delroy Chartier)**: After WLL is set, reduce it by 1 **for this round only** (gives more actions).  
- **Swimming (Edgar Rice)**: When drawing a Crocodile card, discard it immediately.  
- **Lock Picking (Jose Ardila)**: When attempting to open an alcove, if missing **only one number**, treat it as matched.  
- **Reflexes (Maki Watanabe)**: Discard Scorpion or Cobra card immediately when drawn.  
- **Clairvoyance (Rasputin)**: Before Phase 5, draw one block secretly. Choose to:  
  - Keep it (place during Phase 5), OR  
  - Return it and draw another **blindly** (place that one).  
  > Cannot be used if an Udjat card was discarded this round.  

#### **Equipment Cards (Single Use, Except Bag)**  
- **Antidote**: Discard Scorpion or Cobra card.  
- **Medi-kit**: Discard Crocodile or Block Wound card.  
- **Crowbar**: Use like Lock Picking ability.  
- **Udjat**: Use like Clairvoyance ability.  
- **Bag**: Place 2 treasures (not Idols) on it — they count as **1 card** for WLL.  

> **Restriction**: Udjat and Clairvoyance **cannot both be used in the same round**.  

#### **Idol Mechanic**  
- Idols are kept face up.  
- When rolling dice for actions, **ignore the die** matching the color shown on the idol (reduces possible actions).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### **Game End**  
The game ends when:  
- The boulder reaches the final corridor space (from other versions), OR  
- All players are eliminated, OR  
- Last player exits the pyramid.  

#### **Victory Conditions**  
Only **surviving players** can win. Score:

- **Variety Bonus** based on number of gods represented:  
  - 1 god: +1  
  - 2 gods: +3  
  - 3 gods: +6  
  - 4 gods: +10  
  - 5 gods: +15

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use multiple abilities in one turn?**  
  No. Each special ability may be used **only once per game**, regardless of turn.  

- **Can I dodge and still move diagonally?**  
  No. Dodge only prevents the wound. Movement must be to adjacent non-diagonal space unless another ability (e.g., Jump) allows diagonal.  

- **If I use Stamina, does it affect other players?**  
  No. Only your own WLL is reduced for action calculation.  

- **What happens if a mummy is shot and then moves onto me next turn?**  
  You are on the same space → draw a Mummy Wound card.  

- **Can I use Equipment and Special Ability in same turn?**  
  Yes, unless restricted (e.g., Udjat + Clairvoyance in same round).  

- **Can I search immediately after moving into a zone?**  
  Yes.  

- **Do idols count toward WLL?**  
  Yes. Idols are **Treasure cards** and count toward WLL.  

- **Can I discard treasures during Phase 1 only?**  
  Yes. Adjustments to load are only allowed at start of Phase 1.
