# NIGHTFALL — Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In the aftermath of Nightfall—a cataclysm that plunged the world into perpetual darkness—immortal horrors and resolute humans battle for dominance. Players command terrifying creatures of legend, using minions and actions to wound opponents. The game ends when the supply of visible wound cards is exhausted. The player with the fewest wounds wins, proving themselves the strongest ruler of this darkened world.

## 2. Components
- 228 Order Cards:
  - 60 Starting Minions (10 cards each of 6 types: "Bad Smoke", Charlotte Reyes, Enraged Wight, "Genesis One", J.J. McTeague, Yuri Koroviev)
  - 84 Additional Minions
  - 84 Actions
- 60 Wound Cards (types: bite, burn, bleed)
- 24 Draft Cards
- 31 Card Dividers (for organizing cards)
- 3 Extra Card Dividers (for promotional cards)
- Rulebook

## 3. Setup
### Initial Preparation
1. Separate wound, draft, and order cards.
2. Sort order cards by name into 30 piles: 18 minion piles and 12 action piles.
3. Identify the 6 starting minion piles (yellow titles, cost 0). Each contains 10 cards.
4. Create five 12-card starting decks, each with 2 copies of each of the 6 starting minions.
5. Place all card piles in the box using dividers for organization.

### Game Setup
1. Shuffle wound cards and place face down. Count off 10 × number of players (e.g., 30 for 3 players) and turn them face up on top of the stack.
2. Give each player one starting deck.
3. Shuffle draft cards and deal 4 face down to each player. Set aside the remainder.
4. Each player selects one draft card for their first private archive, passes the remaining 3 left.
5. Each player selects one of the 3 passed cards for their second private archive, passes the remaining 2 left.
6. Each player takes one of the 2 passed cards and places it face down in the center to form the commons. Return the final card to the box.
7. Add cards from the set-aside draft pile to the commons until there are 8 total.
8. Turn all draft cards (private archives and commons) face up.
9. Replace each draft card with a stack of 7 corresponding order cards to form archives.
10. Return draft cards to the box.
11. Each player shuffles their starting deck and draws 5 cards.
12. Determine first player by mutual agreement.

### 2-Player Alternate Draft
- First drafted card is removed from the game.
- Second and third drafted cards become private archives.
- Last card goes to the commons.

### Quick Start Option
Skip drafting. Assign each player one of these pre-made pairs:
- Alton Hickman + Ghoul Summoning
- Death Grip + Ivan Radinsky
- Blood Rage + Lilith Lawrence
- Flank Attack + Franz Orlok
- Grim Siege + Vulko
- Marcus Toth + Rend and Tear
- Shock and Awe + Zacharias Sands

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn proceeds through four phases in order:
1. **Combat Phase**: All minions in play attack.
2. **Chain Phase**: Create and resolve a chain of orders.
3. **Claim Phase**: Spend influence to acquire cards.
4. **Cleanup Phase**: Draw cards and resolve one wound effect.

Play passes clockwise. All phases must be completed before the next player's turn.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Decks and Piles
- Each player has a personal deck and discard pile.
- You may look through your discard pile but not your deck.
- If your deck is empty when drawing, shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck.
- Discarded or destroyed cards go face up on your discard pile.
- Claimed cards go directly to your discard pile.

### Archives
- Archives are stacks of 7 identical order cards.
- **Private Archives** (2 per player): Only you can claim from these.
- **Commons** (8 in center): All players can claim from these.
- Draft cards are placeholders; replace them with order card stacks after drafting.
- Archives cease to exist when empty.

### Cards
- **Order Cards**: Two types—Minions and Actions.
- **Minions**: Have strength (damage), health (red slashes), and keyword (species).
- **Actions**: Instant effects; no strength or health.
- **Wound Cards**: Represent damage; placed in discard pile when received.

### Color and Linking
- Each card has a **color** (large moon icon, top-left).
- Each card has **link colors** (small moon icons below color).
- To link a card to a chain, its color must match a link color on the last card played.

### Chaining
- On your turn, you may start a chain by playing one card for free.
- Add more cards by linking (color matches link color of last card).
- Opponents may then add cards to the chain clockwise, following linking rules.
- Each opponent has one opportunity to add cards.
- Unresolved cards in a chain are not "in play."

### Resolving the Chain
- Resolve cards in reverse order: last played first.
- "Chain:" text resolves for all players.
- "Your Chain:" text only resolves if you started the chain.
- Actions go to owner's discard pile when resolved.
- Minions enter play when resolved.
- Resolve as much of the chain text as possible.
- Damage is resolved as in Combat Phase.

### Kicker
- Some cards have kicker text with a color icon.
- If you link a card directly to a card of the kicker's color, you gain the kicker bonus when the card resolves.
- Kicker resolves even if the linked-to card hasn't resolved yet.

### Combat Phase
- All minions in play must attack.
- Assign each minion to attack one opponent.
- Multiple minions can attack the same opponent.
- Resolve attacks in any order you choose.
- Defender may assign minions to block.
- One blocking minion absorbs damage until destroyed before next blocker takes damage.
- Defender chooses order of blockers.
- Damage not absorbed by blockers becomes wounds to the defending player (1 wound per damage).
- Minions that block direct damage have "This card blocks damage inflicted on you" text.
- After combat, discard all attacking minions unless they have text like "This card stays in play until destroyed."

### Claim Phase
- Start each turn with 2 influence.
- Gain 1 influence per card discarded from hand during this phase.
- Influence can also come from card effects.
- Influence is used to claim cards from private archives or commons.
- Cost is shown on the right edge of the card.
- Claimed cards go to your discard pile.
- You may claim multiple cards or copies if you have enough influence.
- Unused influence is lost at end of turn.

### Cleanup Phase
- Draw cards until you have 5 in hand.
- You may use one effect from one wound card in your hand.
- You cannot use effects from other wound cards or from wounds drawn during this phase.
- All card effects end at the end of the turn.

### Targeting
- "Target" means choosing a specific player, minion, archive, wound, or order.
- You cannot target cards in hand or deck.
- Effects that prevent targeting do not affect non-targeting effects (e.g., "damage all opposing minions").

### Simultaneous Events
- Nothing happens simultaneously.
- The player whose card triggered the event chooses resolution order.

### Exiling
- Exiled cards are removed from the game permanently.
- Starting minions exile when destroyed or discarded.
- Discarding a starting minion from hand (e.g., for influence) does not exile it.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends when the last face-up wound card is taken from the stack.
- Finish resolving the current phase (combat or chain).
- Use face-down wound cards for additional wounds if needed.
- Each player counts all wound cards in deck, hand, and discard pile.
- Player with fewest wounds wins.

### Tiebreakers
1. Compare highest count of any wound type (bite, bleed, burn). Player with lower high count wins.
2. If still tied, compare second highest count.
3. If still tied, player closest to the right of the first player wins.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Starting Minions**: Exile when destroyed or discarded from play. Discarding from hand (e.g., for influence) does not exile them.
- **Blocking Direct Damage**: Only blocks damage from attacks or chain effects, not "receive wounds" effects.
- **Kicker Effects**: Resolve when the card resolves, even if the linked-to card hasn't resolved.
- **Chain Resolution**: Must resolve all possible effects, even if disadvantageous.
- **Minion Health**: Rotate card 90° clockwise per damage. Rotate counterclockwise to restore health.
- **Discard Pile**: Always face up; you may look through your own.
- **Archives**: Keep separate and visible; do not count remaining cards.
