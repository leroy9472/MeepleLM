## GHOSTS OF CHRISTMAS — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
You are players manipulating time across three eras—Past, Present, and Future—using cards to win tricks. The goal is to fulfill your bid on the number of tricks you will win during a hand. Success earns points based on your bid type; failure earns nothing. The player with the most points after a full game (one hand per player) wins.

### 2. Components  
- 48 Cards: Numbered 1–12 in four suits (colors)  
- 1 Victory Point (VP) Tracker  
- 16 Ghost Board Pieces (4 per player)  
- 6 Purple Door Tokens (bidding)  
- 4 Era Dials (one per player)  
- 4 Red Door Tokens (flexible bidding)  
- 4 Score Cubes (track score on VP tracker)  
- 12 Wreath Tokens (trick rewards)  
- 1 Start Player Marker  

*Note:* The "Beyond Dial" and "Ghost Board Pieces" are not used in base game.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place VP tracker, doors, wreaths, dials, and score cubes within reach.  
2. Each player assembles their Ghost Board (3-era layout).  
3. Randomly assign the Start Player Marker.  
4. **For 3 players:** Remove cards 1, 2, and 3 from each suit (36 cards total).  
5. Shuffle remaining cards and deal 12 to each player.  
6. Turn all Era Dials face down.  

> Game consists of multiple **hands**. Each hand has 4 rounds. Play one hand per player (3 or 4 hands total).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Bidding Phase** – Players secretly bid using door tokens.  
2. **Rounds (x4 per hand)** – Each round:
   - **Trick Placement:** Players take turns playing one card at a time into any of the three eras (Past, Present, Future), filling all three slots.
   - **Trick Scoring:** Resolve tricks in order: Past → Present → Future.
   - Discard played cards, reset dials face down, keep Start Player Marker with Future trick winner.
3. **Hand Scoring** – After 4 rounds, compare tricks won vs. bid.
4. Reset and begin next hand. Game ends after one hand per player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Bidding  
- Beginning with Start Player, proceed clockwise.  
- Take **purple doors** equal to number of tricks you predict.  
- Optionally, replace **one** purple door with a **red door** for flexibility.  
  - All purple: Bid successful only if you win **exactly** that many tricks.  
  - With red: Bid successful if you win **either** the number of purple doors **or** that number +1 (i.e., total of all doors).  

#### Playing a Round  
- Start Player begins; players take turns playing **one card** to **any empty era** (Past, Present, or Future) on their board.  
- **Era Dial Rules:**
  - If dial is **face down**, play **any suit**. Then turn dial face up and set it to match the suit played.
  - If dial is **face up**, you **must follow suit** if able. If not, play any card.
- Continue until each player has played 3 cards (one per era).

#### Scoring Tricks  
Resolve in order: **Past → Present → Future**  
- **Lead Player:** Determines scoring suit for the trick.
  - Past: Start Player sets the scoring suit.
  - Present: Winner of Past sets it.
  - Future: Winner of Present sets it.
- **Winning the Trick:**
  - Highest **Heart** wins (Hearts are **trumps**).
  - If no Hearts played, highest card of the **scoring suit** wins.
- **Winner receives:**
  - Start Player Marker (for next round),
  - One Wreath Token,
  - May place wreath on an empty door (if available).

> **Important:** Scoring suit ≠ dial suit. Hearts always trump.

#### After Scoring  
- Discard all played cards.
- Flip Era Dials face down.
- Winner of **Future** trick keeps Start Player Marker for next round.
- If hands are not empty, begin next round. Otherwise, score the hand.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After 4 rounds (hand complete):

- **Check Conditions:**
  - All **purple doors** must have a wreath.
  - All **wreaths** must be placed on a door (purple or red).
  - If either condition fails → score **0 VP**.

- **If conditions met:**
  - **With red door in bid:** Score **1 VP per wreath**.
  - **No red door (all purple):** Score **2 VP per wreath**.

> Examples:
> - Bid 3 purple, win exactly 3 → 3 wreaths on doors → 6 VP.
> - Bid 3 purple + 1 red, win 3 or 4 → 1 VP per wreath (max 4 VP).
> - Win fewer than purple bids or more than total bids → 0 VP.

- Return all doors and wreaths.
- Play next hand. After **one hand per player**, game ends.
- Highest total score wins. Ties = shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play out of order across eras?**  
  Yes. You may play to any era, regardless of others’ choices. This can help avoid being forced to follow suit later.

- **What if I can’t follow the dial suit?**  
  You may play any card.

- **Does the dial suit affect who wins?**  
  No. Only used to determine legal plays. Winning depends on **Hearts (trump)** or **scoring suit** set by lead player.

- **Can I place a wreath on a red door?**  
  Yes. Red door can hold a wreath, but it’s optional. Purple doors **must** have wreaths to score.

- **What happens to leftover wreaths?**  
  If any wreath is not on a door, or any purple door lacks a wreath → 0 VP.

- **Can I win more than 3 tricks with a red door?**  
  Only up to **total number of doors** (purple + red). Winning more than that fails the bid.
