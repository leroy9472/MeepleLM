## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Inca Empire*, players take on the role of Apus (regional governors) expanding the Inca Empire under the divine rule of the Sapa Inca. The empire grows through road building, conquering regions, and constructing cities, temples, and other improvements. The game reflects the historical expansion of the Inca across diverse and extreme landscapes, influenced by religious and environmental forces.

**Objective**: The player with the most victory points (VP) at the moment Pizarro arrives in Cuzco wins. The game ends after the Sapa Inca Phase of the Late Empire (Fourth Era), unless the "Pizarro's Arrival" variant is used, which introduces a random end trigger.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Board Setup**:  
   - Place the game board and Sun Event board with the side matching the number of players.  
   - Place all markers (Labor, Cities, Garrisons, Terraces, Temples) in a bank near the board.

2. **Player Assignment**:  
   - Shuffle and deal one Construction Cost card to each player. This determines their color, starting region, and improvement costs.  
   - Players take matching colored Inca figure and 60 wooden sticks.

3. **Starting Position**:  
   - Each player places their Inca figure on the 0 VP space of the scoring track.  
   - Each player places one wooden stick on the road connecting Cuzco to their starting region.

4. **Local Culture Markers**:  
   - Place one face-down Local Culture marker in each region except the four starting regions around Cuzco.  
   - Reveal all Local Culture markers adjacent to starting regions.

5. **Sun Event Deck**:  
   - Shuffle the 32 Sun Event cards.  
   - Each player is dealt 3 cards face down.  
   - Place the remaining deck face down on the board.

6. **Era Tracker**:  
   - Place the black Inca figure on the first space (top of first column) of the Era track.

7. **Turn Order Tiles**:  
   - Shuffle and deal one tile per player. Players keep them face down until needed.

**3-Player Game Adjustments**:  
- Use 3-player sides of boards.  
- Use only Turn Order tiles 1–3.  
- Remove:  
  - 1x Annual Pilgrimage  
  - 1x Great Pilgrimage

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of four phases, advanced by moving the black Inca figure:

1. **Inca Phase**  
2. **Sun Phase**  
3. **People Phase**  
4. **Sapa Inca Phase**  

The black Inca figure moves down one space after each phase. When the bottom of a column is reached, it resets to the top of the next column (new round). The game ends after the Sapa Inca Phase of the Fourth Era.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Inca Phase  
1. **Receive Labor Tokens**:  
   - Each player receives Labor = Current Era number (1–4).  
   - Plus: 1 Labor per conquered Local Culture marker (value shown on marker).  
   - Plus: 1 Labor per Terrace built.  

2. **Mutual Support (Aid Trailing Players)**:  
   - **Era 1 (1438–1471)**: No support.  
   - **Era 2 (1471–1493)**: 1st place gives 1 Labor to last place.  
   - **Eras 3–4 (1493–1533)**:  
     - 1st place gives 2 Labor to last place.  
     - 2nd place gives 1 Labor to 3rd place.  
     - In 3-player games, ignore 2nd→3rd support.  

#### Sun Phase  
1. **Determine Turn Order**:  
   - Starting with last place on scoring track, assign Turn Order tiles 1 to 4 (or 1 to 3).  
   - Tiebreaker: Inca figure on the inside of a scoring space is ahead of one on the outside.

2. **Place Sun Event Cards**:  
   - In turn order, each player chooses one Sun Event card from hand and places it face down in any quadrant of the Sun Event board.  
   - Only one card may be placed per quadrant per Sun Phase.  
   - Player draws a replacement card immediately.

3. **Reveal and Resolve Sun Event Cards**:  
   - All placed cards are revealed.  
   - Cards between two colored lines affect both players.  
   - Effects last until the next Sapa Inca Phase.  
   - **Immediate Resolution**:  
     - *Rural Unrest*: Destroy all roads in unconquered regions.  
     - *Popular Support*: Gain 1 Labor per controlled Local Culture marker with resistance "1".  
     - *Fame*: Gain 1 Labor per controlled Local Culture marker worth 4 VP.  
   - **Cumulative Effects**: Most cards stack unless stated otherwise.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Temple Placement**:  
  - Normally on Cities. *Religious Fervor* allows placement on Garrisons.  
  - You do **not** need to have built the City or Garrison.

- **Pilgrimage**:  
  - Great: 7 VP (Pucara de Andagala / Ranchillo)  
  - Annual: 5 VP (Chiquitoy Viejo / Pachacamac)  
  - Local: 4 VP (Machu Picchu / Huanuco Pampa)  
  - Requires connected road system to Temple at the site.  
  - May skip **either** Road Building **or** Construction.  
  - Only **one** Pilgrimage per People Phase.  
  - Cannot combine with Temple build if *Solar Eclipse* is active.

- **Quarreling Gods**:  
  - Resolved **first** in Sun Phase.  
  - Two affected players each choose **one** card on the Sun board to discard (same or different).  
  - Card is then discarded.

- **Earthquake**:  
  - Replace **one City** with a Garrison.  
  - If City had a Temple, remove it.  
  - Card is discarded after resolution.

- **Fame & Popular Support**:  
  - *Fame*: Triggered by controlling Local Culture markers worth **4 VP**  
  - *Popular Support*: Triggered by controlling markers with resistance **"1"**
