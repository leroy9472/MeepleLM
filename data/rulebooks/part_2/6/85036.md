## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *20th Century*, players take on the role of nation-builders managing industrial growth, technological advancement, and environmental consequences over six rounds. The objective is to maximize victory points (VPs) through economic output, scientific progress, efficient land use, and environmental stewardship—while mitigating pollution and garbage accumulation. Success requires balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Scoring & Catastrophe Cards**:  
   - Randomly deal one Round 2 and one Round 4 scoring card; place on board.  
   - Deal two catastrophe cards of each type (I–II, III–IV, V); place face up. Return unused cards to box.  

2. **Tiles**:  
   - Shuffle land tiles face down into a stack.  
   - Shuffle technology tiles face down into a separate stack.  

3. **Player Setup**:  
   - Each player takes:  
     - Colored citizen tokens, player figure, and scoring token  
     - One grey-backed start land tile  
     - 10 coin cards and 10 science point cards  
   - Place 2 citizen tokens on the two cities of the start tile.  
   - Place 1 grey garbage cube anywhere on the start tile.  
   - Mark starting production: 3 coins, 2 science, 0 pollution on player board.  

4. **Main Board Setup**:  
   - Start player places figure on starting circle (top-left). Others follow clockwise.  
   - Beige round marker on Round 1 (top-right).  
   - Beige technology cost indicator on leftmost position based on player count (e.g., above “3” science bottles for 3 players).  

5. **Initial Tile Layout**:  
   - Reveal land and technology tiles face up based on player count (e.g., 6 land and 5 tech tiles for 4 players).

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Game lasts 6 rounds. Rounds 1–5 have 6 phases. Round 6 is shortened.

#### Phase 1: Setup  
- Advance beige round marker to current round.  
- Reveal a new catastrophe card (except Round 1).  
- In Rounds 3 and 5, flip the technology price indicator card to the next side.  
- Refill land and technology tile markets to player-count levels.  

#### Phase 2: Land Auction (and Buy Technology)  
- Start player selects a land tile to auction.  
- Players bid in coins, pass on current tile, or drop out.  
  - Bidding: Must exceed current bid.  
  - Passing: Skip current tile but stay in auction.  
  - Dropping out: Exit auction; may immediately buy **one** technology tile at current cost.  
- Winner pays bid, takes land tile, and:  
  - Places it adjacent to existing lands (must connect geographically, not necessarily by rail).  
  - Adds garbage: 1 cube for 1st land bought this round, 2 for 2nd, etc.  
  - Triggers drop in technology cost: beige figure moves down one space.  
- Winner may choose another land tile to auction.  
- If no one chooses, next clockwise player selects.  
- **Start player for next phase**: Last player to either buy land or drop out.  
- **Consolation**: Any player who buys **no land tiles** this phase receives coins = 2 + minimum land bid.  
- **Bulk Purchase Rule**: Last remaining bidder may buy multiple land tiles at minimum bid price.  

#### Phase 3: Preventing Catastrophes  
- Players bid **science points** to claim catastrophe columns.  
  - Bidding order: Starts with new start player (from Phase 2), proceeds clockwise.  
  - Each player chooses one unclaimed column and bids science points.  
  - Bids are simultaneous in turn order; all must commit.  
- After all have won a column:  
  - Each player pays their science bid.  
  - Collect skull (pollution) points and garbage cubes as indicated on catastrophe card.  
  - Skulls increase pollution level on player board.  
- Note: In 3- or 4-player games, only certain columns are active (see card indicators).  

#### Phase 4: Upkeep & Technology Use  
- **Garbage Placement**:  
  - Garbage from land tiles stays on those tiles.  
  - Garbage from catastrophes is placed now—on any tile in your country.  
- **Citizen Placement**:  
  - Place 1 citizen token on a city of each newly acquired land tile.  
- **Tile Connection**:  
  - New land tiles must be placed adjacent to existing lands.  
  - Rail connections are **not required** between tiles, but needed for recycling.  
- **Technology Use**:  
  - Activate technology tiles (e.g., move citizens, build rails, remove garbage).  
  - Some tech tiles are single-use; others remain in play.  
  - Technology centers (on tech tiles) must be connected via uninterrupted rail to a populated city to boost production.  
- **Update Production**:  
  - Adjust coin, science, and VP production on player board.  
  - Each connected technology center adds its symbol value.  
  - Production can exceed 10.  
  - Note: If a tech tile has two centers, they are separate and must each be connected independently.  

#### Phase 5: Production & Recycling  
- Collect resources:  
  - Receive coins and science cards equal to current production.  
  - Score VPs if production generates them.  
- **Recycling**:  
  - Each **functional recycling center** can remove **1 garbage cube**.  
  - Cube must be on the **same tile** or a **neighboring tile connected by uninterrupted rail**.  
  - One recycle per center, even if multiple garbage cubes are in range.  

#### Phase 6: Bonus Scoring  
- **Rounds 2 and 4**: One scoring card is active (randomly selected at setup). Apply its rule.  
- **Round 6**: All endgame scoring steps apply.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Technology Cost Mechanism  
- Starts at a value based on player count.  
- Decreases by 1 for each land tile purchased.  
- Resets partially in Rounds 3 and 5 with new cost card.  
- Players who drop out early can buy tech tiles cheaply; waiting lowers price.  

#### Pollution & Environment Quality  
- Skulls from catastrophes increase pollution marker on player board.  
- Upper pollution scale:  
  - From -28 to +34 VPs based on position.  
  - "Flower" zone (positive) grants VPs; "Skull" zone (negative) deducts.  
- Garbage affects land scoring directly.  

#### Garbage  
- Acquired from:  
  - Land tile purchase (cumulative: 1st = 1, 2nd = 2, etc.)  
  - Catastrophe results  
- Placed on any tile in your country.  
- Removed via recycling centers (if connected by rail).  

#### Scoring Tiles  
- **Land tiles**: Score in Round 6 based on garbage:  
  - 0 garbage: score environment bonus (2/3/4 VPs based on pollution level)  
  - 1 garbage: 0 VPs  
  - 2+ garbage: -5 VP for each garbage **beyond the first** (e.g., 2 = -5, 3 = -10)  
- **Technology tiles**: Do not score directly; provide ongoing benefits.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Final Scoring (Round 6 only):**  

1. **Most Coins**:  
   - Compare coins in hand.  
   - 8 VP for most, 0 for least/none.  
   - Intermediate: 5 (2nd), 3 (3rd), 1 (4th).  
   - Ties: Add VP values of tied ranks, divide equally, round down.  

2. **Most Science**:  
   - Scored identically to Most Coins.  

3. **Land Tiles**:  
   - 0 garbage: score environment bonus (based on pollution scale: 2/3/4 VPs)  
   - 1 garbage: 0 VP  
   - 2+ garbage: -5 VP per **extra** garbage (i.e., beyond first)  

4. **Environment Quality Score**:  
   - Adjust total VP by pollution scale value (e.g., +12 or -8).  

**Winning**:  
- Player with most VPs wins.  
- Tiebreaker 1: Fewer garbage cubes in country.  
- Tiebreaker 2: Shared victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I pass on all land tiles and still buy tech?**  
  Yes, as long as you eventually drop out. Passing doesn’t allow tech purchase; dropping out does.  

- **When does technology cost reset?**  
  It never fully resets. It drops with each land purchase and is modified in Rounds 3 and 5 by flipping the cost card.  

- **Can I place new land tiles anywhere?**  
  Must be adjacent to existing lands, but rail doesn’t need to connect.  

- **Do rails need to connect for production?**  
  No, but rails are required for recycling and for technology centers to be “connected” to cities.  

- **Can I use a tech tile the turn I buy it?**  
  Yes, during Phase 4 (Upkeep).  

- **What happens if I can’t place garbage from a catastrophe?**  
  You must place it—there is no limit on per-tile garbage.  

- **Can I recycle garbage from a tile not connected by rail?**  
  No. Rail connection (uninterrupted) is required between recycling center and garbage tile.  

- **Is the start tile subject to scoring?**  
  Yes. It is a land tile and scores like any other.
