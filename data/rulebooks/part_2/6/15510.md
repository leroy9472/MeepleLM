## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players take on the roles of builders contributing to the construction of the 8 Wonders of the Ancient World. The goal is to earn the most victory points by placing the most building parts on completed wonders and collecting building discs. Victory points are earned both during the game through scoring completed wonders and in final scoring based on building disc collections and remaining contributions.

The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.

### 3. Setup  
**For 4 players (adjustable for 3–5):**

1. Remove all building discs from frames. Set aside the 4 two-colored discs (optional use per page 4).
2. Shuffle the remaining 24 building discs face down. Randomly place 1 face up on each of the 24 building spaces (3 per wonder) across the 8 wonders.
3. Place the scoring marker on the topmost space of the scoring table.
4. Shuffle the action cards and place them face down near the board.
5. Shuffle the building cards and form a face-down supply; place near the board.
6. Each player:
   - Chooses a color
   - Takes 20 building parts and 1 column in that color
   - Takes 1 trading card
   - Draws 4 building cards (kept private)
7. Each player places:
   - 1 value-1 building part on the start space of the victory point track
   - Remaining building parts in front of them (personal supply)
8. Determine starting player. That player places their column on the bottom space of the turn order track. Others place theirs in clockwise ascending order above.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in order from bottom to top of the turn order track. On a turn, the active player chooses one of two actions:

- **Pass**
- **Build**

After resolving the action, the player moves all other columns down one space and places their own column in the lowest empty space on the turn order track. Then, **each player (including the active player)** draws 1 building card.

Turn proceeds clockwise.

---

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Pass Action  
- Take 1 building card from the supply.
- Remove your column from the turn order track.
- Move all other columns down one space.
- Place your column in the lowest empty space.
- All players draw 1 building card.

Player is still active and may be called again later.

---

#### Build Action  

**Step 1: Select Wonder**  
- Move your column to any wonder.
- Take the top building disc from that wonder. It shows:
  - A building type (camel, crane, ship, stone mason), **or**
  - Two types (for two-colored discs)
  - A number (1–5) indicating how many building cards of the required type(s) are needed.

**Step 2: Make Offer**  
- All opponents simultaneously place face-down offers:
  - May offer building cards of the needed type(s)
  - May include their **trading card** along with building cards
  - Cannot offer more cards than the number shown on the disc
  - Offers may include incorrect types (but will be discarded)
- Active player does **not** make an offer.

All reveal offers simultaneously.  
Discard any offered cards that do **not** match needed type(s). These return to hand.

**Step 3: Select Opponent(s)**  
- Active player may accept **none to all** opponent offers.
- If an opponent included a **trading card**, the active player may accept **only one** such offer.
- Total accepted building cards (from all selected opponents) **must not exceed** the number required.
- For two-colored discs: total accepted of **each type** must not exceed the number required for that type.

**Step 4: Build**  
- If total accepted cards < required, active player adds cards from hand to meet the total.
- Each selected opponent places **1 building part per card contributed**.
- Active player places **1 building part per card they contributed**.
- If a selected opponent played a **trading card**:
  - The **active player takes the building disc**
  - But **replaces** the building parts the opponent just placed with their **own** parts
  - The **opponent keeps the building disc**
- The active player takes the building disc (unless opponent used trading card), places it **face down** in their play area.

**Step 5: End of Build Turn**  
- All played building cards go to discard pile.
- Opponents whose offers were **not selected**:
  - Earn **1 VP per correctly typed building card** they offered
  - Take back all offered cards (including trading cards)
- All trading cards are returned to their owners’ hands.
- Active player:
  - Moves all other columns down one space
  - Places own column in lowest empty space
  - All players draw 1 building card

#### Special Case: Build Not Fulfilled  
If the total number of required cards (from offers + active player) is **not met**:
- No building occurs
- Building disc is returned to its wonder
- All opponents who offered **correctly typed cards** earn **1 VP per such card**
- They take back all offered cards
- All players draw 1 building card

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### During Game: Scoring a Completed Wonder  
When the **last building disc** is removed from a wonder (i.e., third disc taken), score it immediately:

1. Check number of building parts each player has on that wonder.
2. Use current row of scoring table (indicated by scoring marker):
   - Highest contributor: top VP value
   - Second-highest contributor: second VP value
   - All others with ≥1 part: 3 VP
3. **Tie rules:**
   - **Tie for first**: All tied score **second-place VP**; others with parts score 3 VP
   - **One first, tie for second**: First scores top VP; all others with parts score 3 VP (no second-place points)
4. Players advance victory point counters accordingly.
5. Move scoring marker down one row on scoring table.
6. Active player (who triggered the scoring) takes **1 action card**.
7. All players **retrieve their building parts** from the completed wonder.

---

#### Final Scoring  
Game ends when the **last building disc of any type** is taken (including two-colored discs, which count for both types).  
**If** a wonder is completed by this action, **score it first**.

Then:
1. Move scoring marker to **light-colored space** at bottom of scoring table.
2. Score **all incomplete wonders** as if complete, using this final row.
3. **No action cards** are awarded during final scoring.
4. Players retrieve all building parts from incomplete wonders.
5. **Bonus scoring**:
   - Use bonus table on board: score extra VPs for collecting multiple building discs of the same type
   - Two-colored discs: player chooses **one color** to count it as (not both)
6. Add all VPs (from track and bonuses).
7. Highest total wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I offer zero cards?**  
A: Yes. This is allowed. You offer nothing, reveal nothing, and gain nothing unless the build fails and you had no cards to gain points from.

**Q: Can I use a trading card without offering any cards?**  
A: No. The trading card must be **accompanied by at least one building card**.

**Q: Can I use multiple trading cards?**  
A: No. Each player has only one trading card. It is returned after each turn.

**Q: What happens if I don’t have enough cards to fulfill a build?**  
A: You are not required to complete the build. If the total cards (offers + your own) don’t meet the requirement, the build fails (special case). No parts are placed, disc is returned, opponents gain 1 VP per correct card.

**Q: Can I use an action card during my turn?**  
A: Yes, unless specified otherwise. Cards like "Card trade" and "Card draw" can be used at any time. "Joker" can only be used during a build action.

**Q: When are building cards drawn?**  
A: After **every turn** (pass or build), **all players** draw 1 card.

**Q: Do two-colored discs count for both types in final game end?**  
A: Yes. When determining game end, two-colored discs count toward the total of both types.

**Q: Can I score a two-colored disc for both colors in final bonus?**  
A: No. You must choose **one color** to score it for.
