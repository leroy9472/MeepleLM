## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The goal of Poison is to finish the game with the lowest total score (fewest negative points). Players take turns playing cards into one of three Cauldrons, trying to avoid being forced to take cards that exceed a total value of 13. At the end of each round, players score negative points for most cards they hold, unless they have the majority in a color. Poison cards always score negatively, regardless of majority.

The game is played over several rounds, with each player serving as dealer once. After all players have dealt, the game ends and the player with the lowest total score wins.

2. Components  
- 3 Cauldrons (placed in the center of the table)  
- 50 Cards:  
  - Poison cards (value 4, green): 8 cards  
  - Red, Blue, and Purple potion cards: 14 each (values: 1, 2, 5, and 7)  

Optional Expansions (from supplementary file):  
- Zero Promo Expansion Cards: cards with value 0  
- Wild Card Expansion Cards: cards that adopt the value of the card they are played on, then count as 0  

3. Setup  
- Choose a starting dealer. After each round, the deal passes clockwise.  
- The dealer shuffles all cards (including any expansion cards if used).  
- Deal all cards evenly among players. In a 3-player game, deal as if for 4 players and remove one pile. One or more players may have one extra card.  
- Place the 3 Cauldrons in the center of the table.  
- The player to the left of the dealer goes first.

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. Players take turns clockwise.  
2. On a turn, a player plays one card faceup to any Cauldron.  
3. After playing, if the total value of cards in that Cauldron exceeds 13, the player must take all cards currently in that Cauldron (before the current card was played), placing them face-down in front of themselves. The played card becomes the first card of the new heap in that Cauldron.  
4. Play continues until all players have played all cards from their hands.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Color Rule**: Once a non-Poison card is played on a Cauldron, only cards of that color may be added. That color is now locked to that Cauldron.  
- **Poison Cards (green)**: Can be played on any Cauldron, regardless of color. They do not lock the Cauldron to green. A Poison card may be the first card on a Cauldron, after which a player may start a new color.  
- **Zero Promo Cards**: Value 0. They obey color rules but never cause a Cauldron to exceed 13 due to their value.  
- **Wild Cards**: When played, take on the value of the card they are played on (matching color), which may cause the total to exceed 13. However, once played, the Wild Card is treated as value 0. Must obey both color and point rules at time of play.  
- **Taking a Cauldron**: Triggered when a player plays a card that would make the total value on a Cauldron exceed 13. The player takes all cards that were in the Cauldron before their card was placed. Their card starts a new pile.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- A round ends when all players have no cards left in hand.  
- Players reveal all cards they collected during the round.  
- Scoring:  
  - -1 point for each Red, Blue, or Purple potion card  
  - -2 points for each Poison card  
- **Majority Rule**: For each color (Red, Blue, Purple), the player with the most cards of that color discards all their cards of that color and scores 0 for them.  
  - If there is a tie for most cards in a color, no player gains the majority benefit — all players score their cards of that color normally.  
  - Poison cards are not subject to majority protection — they always score -2 each, even if a player has the most.  
- Add scores to running total.  
- If not all players have dealt yet, shuffle all cards, deal next round (starting new dealer), and continue.  
- Game ends after each player has been dealer once.  
- Winner: The player with the lowest total score.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a Poison card start a new Cauldron?** Yes. Afterward, any player may play a colored card (Red, Blue, or Purple) to establish a new color on that Cauldron.  
- **What happens if a player plays a card that brings a Cauldron exactly to 13?** No penalty — play continues. Only exceeding 13 triggers card collection.  
- **Can two Cauldrons have the same color?** No. Once a color is played on a Cauldron, it is locked to that Cauldron. Other colors may not be duplicated elsewhere.  
- **Do Zero or Wild cards affect majority count?** Yes. They count as their color when determining majority, even though Wild Cards have value 0 after play.  
- **What if a player plays a Wild Card on a Poison-only Cauldron?** Not allowed. Wild Cards must match the current color. Since Poison does not establish a color lock, a Wild Card may not be played unless it matches a color already established by a potion card.  
- **Tie in majority**: If two or more players tie for most cards in a color, no one discards — all score their cards.
