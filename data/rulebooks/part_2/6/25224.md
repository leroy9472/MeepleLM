## Hermagor — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Hermagor is a strategic economic game set in a medieval-inspired landscape divided into three Dukedoms by rivers. Players act as merchants competing to dominate trade routes, acquire goods, sell in villages, and establish production buildings to generate wealth. The goal is to amass the most cash by the end of the game through shrewd buying, selling, and regional control.

2. Components  
- Game board showing regions, villages, roads, and rivers  
- Price table with product rows and Nobility ("H") row  
- Action Tiles (numbered 3, 4, 5, and optionally 6)  
- Product and Special Tiles (including Floating Market, Shortcut, Black Market, Good Deal)  
- Merchant Cylinders (1 per player)  
- Buyer Cylinders (4 per player)  
- Trade Stations (enough for all players)  
- Price Indicators  
- Wooden Discs (for Production Buildings and Nobility placements)  
- Money ($)

3. Setup  
- Place price indicators to show value '5' on all product rows.  
- Shuffle Action Tiles:  
  - 2/3 players: use tiles 3, 4, 4, 5, 5  
  - 4 players: use 4, 4, 5, 5  
  - 5 players: use 3, 4, 5, 5  
  - Optional: include tile 6 as replacement or addition.  
- Remove tiles 17–20 from the game in 2- or 3-player games.  
- Place remaining product and special tiles into the bag.  
- Each player receives:  
  - 1 Merchant Cylinder (placed in Hermagor)  
  - 4 Buyer Cylinders  
  - $20  
- Determine first player and give them the starting tile.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of three phases:

**Phase 1: Buying in the General Market**  
- Draw and reveal tiles from the bag to fill the market:  
  - 2/3 players: leave top and bottom rows empty  
  - 4 players: leave top row empty  
  - 5 players: fill all rows  
- Reveal one Action Tile — this determines the number of actions (Trade Stations) each player will receive this round.  
- In turn order, players take turns placing one Buyer Cylinder or passing:  
  - On a tile (cost: $2)  
  - On a passage/location (cost varies by location)  
  - Pass — forfeit right to place that buyer this round  
- Players may place up to four buyers (one per turn), passing early if desired.

**Phase 2: Get Ready for Travelling**  
- Income from buyers in passages:  
  - 1 buyer = $1  
  - 2 buyers = $3  
  - 3 buyers = $6  
  - 4 buyers = $10  
  - Buyers at junctions count for both adjacent passages.  
- Acquire product tiles:  
  - The player with the most buyers on or adjacent to a tile wins it.  
  - Tiebreakers:  
    1. Buyers on top of tile > edges > corners/junctions  
    2. Perfect tie or no influence → tile stays in market for next round  
  - Winner takes the tile; if it's a single-product tile (has arrow), they may immediately increase that product’s price by 1 on the price table.  
- End of Phase 2:  
  - Any player who won zero product tiles may draw one non-special product tile from the bag (cannot increase price).  
  - The player holding the lowest-numbered tile chooses the new starting player.  
    - Variant: player declaring the lowest cash total chooses new starter.

**Phase 3: Selling at the Villages**  
- Each player receives a number of Trade Stations equal to the Action Tile drawn.  
- Players take turns performing one action at a time, using one Trade Station per action (or returning it to supply). Actions:  
  - **Movement with Selling**:  
    - Move merchant to any village  
    - Pay full road cost (sum of road segment fees)  
    - Place a Trade Station in the village  
    - Receive income from the current price of the sold product  
    - All other players with a Trade Station in that village receive $1 each  
    - Merchant must not already have a Trade Station in the target village  
  - **Selling Without Movement**:  
    - Sell from current village (no movement)  
    - Road cost = $0  
    - Otherwise identical to movement-with-selling  
  - **Movement Without Selling**:  
    - Move to another village  
    - Pay half the total road cost (rounded down)  
    - Return one Trade Station to supply  
    - No sale occurs  
  - **No Action**:  
    - Return one Trade Station to supply  
- Restrictions:  
  - Merchant cannot stop in a village where the player already has a Trade Station  
  - Only one product may be sold per action  
  - A product tile may be used multiple times across different actions/villages  

- **Completing a Region (Production Buildings)**:  
  - When a player places a Trade Station such that all villages bordering a region have their Trade Station, they complete the region.  
  - They may place a Production Building (wooden disc) on the leftmost open space of a product type shown in the region.  
  - If the space is covered by a price indicator, placement is blocked.  
  - Immediately receive the cash amount printed under that space.  
  - Nobility ("H") regions work the same — place disc on the "H" row, leftmost open, and collect income.  

End of Phase:  
- All acquired tiles are returned to the bag.  
- If Action Tiles remain, begin a new round at Phase 1.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Market Influence**: Determined by number and position of Buyer Cylinders (on tile > edge > corner).  
- **Pricing**: Prices start at 5; can be increased by winning single-product tiles or via Floating Market.  
- **Trade & Movement**: Trade Stations enable actions; road costs apply based on path length and type.  
- **Region Completion**: Triggers Production Building placement and immediate payout.  
- **Special Tiles** (used once, then returned to bag):  
  - **Floating Market**: Immediately increase one product’s price by 1  
  - **Shortcut**: During one "movement with selling", pay half total road cost (rounded down)  
  - **Black Market**: Other players do not receive $1 when you place in their village this round  
  - **Good Deal**: Gain $5 immediately  

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends when no Action Tiles remain.

Final scoring steps for each player:  
- **Production Buildings Income**:  
  - For each product type where you have at least one Production Building, gain the small red number shown at current price level.  
  - Having multiple buildings in a row does not increase income.  
- **Dukedom Bonus**:  
  - Board is divided into 3 Dukedoms by rivers.  
  - Count your Trade Stations in each Dukedom.  
  - Take the smallest count and multiply:  
    - 2–4 players: ×3  
    - 5 players: ×4  
  - Add result as income.  
- **Principal Route Bonus**:  
  - Player(s) with the most Trade Stations on the entire road network: +$5  
  - Player(s) with the fewest: –$5  
  - Ties: multiple players can gain or lose.

Final Cash Total = Current Cash + All Final Incomes

**Winning**: Player with the most cash wins.  
**Tiebreakers**:  
1. Most Production Buildings  
2. If still tied, player furthest left on the Nobility ("H") row wins  
   - (i.e., who placed their disc earliest in the H row)

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can I use the same product tile more than once in Phase 3?  
  A: Yes — a single tile allows unlimited uses during selling phase.  

- Q: What happens if two players tie for most influence in the market?  
  A: Compare placement — on tile > edge > corner. If still tied, tile stays for next round.  

- Q: Can I place a Production Building if the leftmost space is covered by a price indicator?  
  A: No — you cannot place on a hidden space. Wait until price drops or another space opens.  

- Q: Do I get $1 from others when they sell in my village if I have a Trade Station?  
  A: Yes — every time a player sells (with or without movement) in a village where you have a station, you receive $1.  

- Q: Can I move through a village where I have a Trade Station?  
  A: Yes — movement is allowed, but you cannot end your movement there.  

- Q: Can I sell in a village where another player has a Trade Station?  
  A: Yes — you may sell there, but must pay $1 to each player who already has a station.  

- Q: Does Black Market prevent me from receiving $1 when others sell?  
  A: No — Black Market only stops others from getting $1 when *you* build/sell. It does not protect you.
