## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Each player takes on the role of a futuristic thief—an "operative"—infiltrating CyberSolutions, Inc., a high-security corporate facility. The mission is to steal digital data files (DF tokens) containing advanced AI secrets. The operative who escapes with the most data wins.

2. **Components**  
- Operative cards (one per player, with healthy/wounded sides)  
- Operative markers (player-colored)  
- Room cards:  
  - 1st floor (blue)  
  - 2nd floor (yellow)  
  - Secret room (red)  
- Action cards: Advance, Retreat, Interface, Download, Extract  
- Item cards (various unique abilities)  
- Security tracker (with proximity and alarm dials)  
- Die  
- Tokens:  
  - Data File (DF) tokens (face-down, variable values)  
  - Interface (purple) tokens  
  - Tech Lock (yellow) and Lab Worker (red) tokens

  - Blackmail File, Sludge, 4 Prototype cards  
- NPC cards (e.g., James Harris, Officer Nelson, Leah Bailey)

3. **Setup**  
*(For 3–6 players; 2-player rules omitted unless specified)*  
- Youngest player becomes first player, receives die and security tracker.  
- Set proximity and alarm dials to 00 and 0 respectively.  
- Shuffle and deal:  
  - 6 face-down 1st floor (blue) room cards  
  - 6 face-down 2nd floor (yellow) room cards  
  - 1 face-down secret room (red) card  
- Arrange rooms as per rules illustration; remaining room cards return to box.  
- Place Interface, Tech Lock, and Lab Worker tokens near board.  
- Form server pool: shuffle DF tokens face-down.  
- Place Blackmail File, Sludge, Prototype cards, and NPC cards face-up nearby.  
- Deal one Operative card (blue/healthy side up) and matching marker to each player.  
- Give each player:  
  - One each of Advance, Retreat, Interface, and Download action cards *(or Extract if using Extraction rule)*  
  - 4 randomly dealt Item cards  
- Remaining Item cards form a draw pile.  
- Reveal the 1st floor entry room. All players place markers on it.  
- Resolve "Reveal" and "Enter" effects of entry room.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Each round consists of four phases:  
1. **Selection Phase**  
   - Each player selects one Action or Item card face-down.  
   - Delayed operatives cannot play Advance or Retreat.  
   - All cards are revealed simultaneously after selection.  

2. **Resolution Phase**  
   - Players resolve cards in clockwise order, starting with first player.  
   - Action cards are resolved immediately (except Extract).  
   - Item cards are resolved as described, often immediately.  
   - Cards remain face-up until end of round, then return to hand (unless discarded).  

3. **NPC Phase**  
   - Activate all face-up NPC cards in facility, starting from entry room and moving forward.  
   - In case of multiple NPCs in one room, first player chooses resolution order.  
   - Resolve each NPC’s effect (e.g., wound operatives, move, increase proximity).  

4. **Security Phase**  
   - First player rolls die.  
   - Add roll result to current alarm dial value.  
   - Increase proximity dial by this sum.  
   - If proximity dial reaches 99, game ends immediately.  
   - Pass die and security tracker clockwise to next player (new first player).

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Room Reveal**  
  When entering a face-down room:  
  1. Resolve "Reveal" effect  
  2. Resolve "Enter" effect  
  3. Place Interface, Tech Lock, or Lab Worker tokens if present  
  4. Add DF tokens from server pool to room’s token space (face-down)  

- **Actions**  
  - **Advance**: Move forward one room. Reveal room if face-down. Resolve Reveal/Enter effects. No effect in final room.  
  - **Retreat**: Move back one room. Resolve Enter effect. If in entry room, escape facility.  
  - **Interface**: Use room’s Interface function **only if** Interface token is present.  
  - **Download**:  
    - First player in room this round: collect up to 2 DF tokens  
    - Others: collect up to 1 DF token  
  - **Extract** *(Advanced Rule)*:  
    - At end of Resolution Phase, collect DF tokens based on number of Extractors in room:  
      - 1 operative: up to 4 DF  
      - 2 operatives: up to 2 DF each  
      - 3+ operatives: up to 1 DF each  
    - Collected in clockwise order from first player.

- **Item Cards**  
  - Played instead of Action card.  
  - Resolved immediately unless specified.  
  - May stay in play area until end of round, then discarded or returned per card text.  
  - Some affect adjacent rooms (only if revealed).  

- **Tech Locks & Lab Workers**  
  - When destroyed (via game effects), remove token.  
  - Add secure DF tokens (listed above token space) from server pool to room’s available DF space.  
  - Apply any destruction effects before adding DF tokens.  

- **Wounded & Delayed**  
  - **Wounded**: Flip Operative card to red side. Remains wounded until healed.  
  - **Delayed**: After resolving Advance/Retreat while wounded, tip marker sideways.  
    - Cannot play Advance/Retreat in next Selection Phase.  
    - At end of Selection Phase, upright marker (no longer delayed).  

- **Escaping**  
  - Primary: Play Retreat in entry room.  
  - Secondary: Use Interface functions in "Loading Dock" or "Executive Elevator".  
  - Once escaped, player exits game and keeps collected DF tokens.  

- **Secret Room**  
  - Accessible only via Interface in "Research Admin Office" or "Halo Conference Room".  
  - Not adjacent to any room—immune to adjacent-room effects.  
  - To leave: Retreat to Research Admin Office or Advance to Halo Conference Room (if revealed).

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- **Game Ends When**:  
  a) All operatives escape, OR  
  b) Proximity dial reaches 99.  
    - Any operative still inside is arrested and eliminated.  

- **Scoring**:  
  - Escaped operatives flip DF tokens face-up and sum values (in zettabytes).  
  - Prototype cards: worth 10 zettabytes (6 in Original Variant).  
  - Ties broken in this order:  
    1. Player with Prototype card wins  
    2. Most DF tokens  
    3. Player with Blackmail File  
    4. Draw  

- **2-Player Variant**: Each player controls 2 operatives; score is sum of both escaped operatives.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can you re-enter the facility after escaping?**  
  No. Escaped operatives are out of the game.  

- **Can you look at your own DF tokens?**  
  Yes. Players may check their own collected DF tokens at any time.  

- **What happens to DF tokens returned to server pool?**  
  Shuffle them back in.  

- **What if an Item card has multiple effects but only one can be resolved?**  
  Resolving one effect is sufficient.  

- **Can you play Interface if the token is missing?**  
  No. Interface token must be present.  

- **Does “Enter” trigger every time you enter a room?**  
  Yes. “Enter” effects trigger on every entry. “Reveal” only on first reveal.  

- **What if all players are delayed?**  
  They still select cards. Delay only blocks Advance/Retreat selection.  

- **Can NPCs affect unrevealed rooms?**  
  No. NPCs only affect revealed rooms and operatives within them.
