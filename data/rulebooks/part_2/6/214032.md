### 1. Lore & Objective

In the age after the Demon War, the races of Gloomhaven unite to build a new city on the eastern shores — a hub of trade and a symbol of cooperation. Each race brings its specialty, and each seeks influence by contributing to the city's construction. Players compete to earn the most victory points (VP) by delivering resources to prestige buildings, managing influence, and fulfilling achievements.

The game ends when six prestige buildings have all their required resources delivered. At that point, final scoring occurs, and the player with the most points wins.

### 3. Setup

1. **Choose Map Side**: Thematic (tighter, more blocking) or symmetric (open, cooperative).
2. **Place Components**: Put building tiles, tokens, and boards within reach.
3. **Shuffle Decks**:
   - Prestige building cards: shuffle face-down, place beside adviser board.
   - Adviser cards: sort by point value (3, 1, 0), shuffle each tier, stack 3s on bottom, 1s on top.
4. **Deal Cards**:
   - 3 prestige building cards to top of adviser board (from bottom of deck).
   - 4 adviser cards to bottom of adviser board.
   - Replace duplicates: if two prestige cards of same shape/color appear, return rightmost to top of deck and replace.
5. **Determine Starting Player**: Randomly assign; give active player token. Play proceeds clockwise.
6. **Choose Races**:
   - Each player picks a race (color), takes corresponding player mat, action cards (5, or 6 in 2-player), $7, vote tiles.
   - Take 3 house tiles, 3 bridge/gate tiles, 3 worker pawns, claim/delivery tokens.
   - Place one claim token on score track (0), one delivery token on income track (1).
7. **Draft Resources**:
   - Each player starts with one racial resource (e.g., Human: Population).
   - In reverse player order, each drafts a second resource (cannot choose red-forbidden resources on mat).
   - In 2-player: each drafts a third resource in player order (cannot be forbidden by any owned resource).
   - Neutral resources (unclaimed) are set aside; their tiles can be imported.
8. **Place Starting Resource**:
   - In reverse player order, each player places one of their racial resource tiles on a grey space marked with number ≤ player count.
   - Place own claim token on it.
   - Place delivery token on “own” space for that resource on resource tracker.
9. **Final Setup**:
   - Workers start on player’s house tiles (unavailable).
   - Income starts at 1 for all players.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

On a player’s turn, they play one action card from their hand. Play proceeds clockwise until the game ends.

#### Turn Options:

1. **Call to Work** (play card face-up):
   - Perform main action (Recruit, Trade, Upgrade, Construct).
   - All other players may follow with the card’s follow action or a basic action.
2. **Basic Action** (play any card face-down except Call to Vote):
   - Perform one of: gain $1, gain 1 fleeting influence, build 1 connected road, or perform a worker action (race or prestige).
   - No follow actions occur.
3. **Call to Vote** (play face-up only if 2+ cards played in 3–4 players, 3+ in 2-player):
   - Reset: gain $1 / 1 fleeting influence / 1 road per card in hand.
   - Return all played cards and workers to hand/mat.
   - Other players collect income: $1 per unique owned resource, +1 fleeting influence per house.
   - Vote on prestige building: secret bid using vote tile and influence (fleeting = 1, lasting = 2).
   - Winning building is placed; highest contributor places it.
   - Discard losing proposals; draw 3 new ones (replace duplicates).

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Actions

- **Recruit (Main)**:
  - Pay cost ($1 or $2) to take adviser card.
  - Must own or have access to adviser’s required resource.
  - Gain 1 fleeting influence + any points/lasting influence on card.
  - Add card to hand.
- **Recruit (Follow)**:
  - Same as main, but no fleeting influence gained.
- **Trade (Main)**:
  - **Import**: Place one of your basic resource tiles on board. Pay terrain cost: red=$1, white=$2, green/gray=$3.
  - **Buy Access**: Pay owner (or bank for neutral) terrain cost + $1 to place your claim token under theirs.
  - **Import & Access Neutral**: Pay $4 to bank to place neutral resource with neutral token on top, your token below. Available in 2–3 player games.
- **Trade (Follow)**:
  - Can import or buy access, but only on red or white terrain. Cannot import & access.
- **Upgrade (Main)**:
  - Pay $4 (tier 2) or $6 (tier 3) to build advanced resource.
  - Must connect (via adjacency or road) to all required resources; must have access to them.
  - May build 1 connected road before or after placing building.
- **Upgrade (Follow)**:
  - Same as main, but no extra road.
- **Construct (Main)**:
  - Pay $4 to build house or bridge/gate, but $3 total due to $1 discount.
  - **House**: on green terrain; not adjacent to owned buildings; unlocks 1 worker; gives +1 fleeting influence at income.
  - **Bridge/Gate**: on river/wall; connects sections; only for owner’s use.
- **Construct (Follow)**:
  - Same as main, but full $4 cost.
- **Call to Vote**: See above.
- **Income (2-player only)**:
  - Main: collect income ($1 per unique owned resource, +1 fleeting influence per house).
  - Follow: can perform any of the four main follow actions (Recruit, Trade, Upgrade, Construct) or basic action.

#### Connections & Placement

- **Adjacency**: All 8 surrounding tiles (including diagonals).
- **Connection**: Tiles are connected if adjacent or linked by road chain. Does not pass through buildings.
- **IBR #1**: When building (except basic resources), must connect to something you own.
- **IBR #2**: Cannot own two adjacent buildings (houses or resource tiles). Bridges/gates are exception.
- **IBR #3**: Each city section (divided by rivers/walls) can have only:
  - One of each resource type (any tier).
  - One house per player.
  - One prestige building of each shape/color.
- **Prestige Building Placement**:
  - Must cover at least one space of terrain matching its border color.
  - Cannot overlap roads, buildings, or unbuildable spaces.
  - Cannot duplicate same-type prestige building in section.
  - Some (Gatehouses, Ghost Fortress) have fixed locations.

#### Scoring

- **Advanced Resources (Tier 2/3)**:
  - When built, pay points to owners of required resources (values on tile).
  - If advanced resource is used (e.g., Books for Government), its prerequisites also score (cascade).
  - Value in parentheses (+X) is net points after paying prerequisites.
  - Neutral basic resources deduct 2 VP from payout (owner gets nothing).
- **Prestige Buildings**:
  - When a required resource is connected by its owner, it is delivered.
  - Owner places delivery token on building and scores points shown.
  - Points cascade through supply chain (same as above).
  - Neutral basic resources deliver immediately upon building placement (no connection needed).
  - Once delivered, resource cannot deliver again to same building.
  - When all resources delivered, place completion token.
- **Achievements (Optional)**:
  - Immediate (red): score when condition met, any turn.
  - Mid-game (blue): score when 2 prestige buildings completed.
  - End-game (purple): score at end of game.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

- **End Game Trigger**: When 6th prestige building is completed (all resources delivered).
- **Final Turn**: Complete current turn (including follow actions), then end.
- **Final Scoring**:
  - 1 VP per lasting influence.
  - 1 VP per $4 (round down).
  - Score end-game achievement.
- **Winning**: Highest score wins. Tie: player closest to active player (clockwise) wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can I build adjacent to opponent’s building?** Yes. IBR #2 only restricts owning two adjacent buildings.
- **Can I use opponent’s road for connection?** Yes. All roads are shared.
- **Can I follow a basic action?** No.
- **Can I use prestige building action without delivering?** No. Must have delivered at least one resource.
- **What if prestige building has no legal placement?** Remove card from game, draw replacement.
- **Do I pay points to myself?** No. If you own a prerequisite, you keep the points without paying.
- **Can I buy access to advanced resources?** Yes. Same terrain cost rules apply.
- **Can I import a resource I already own?** No. Only one per section.
- **When do I increase income?** First time you own a resource type (move income tracker +1).
- **Can I deliver multiple resources at once?** Yes. Resolve one at a time, player chooses order.
