## To Court the King – Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   Players compete to rise in the royal court by persuading court figures to join their cause. Success is measured through dice manipulation and strategic use of character abilities. The goal is to either be the first to roll seven of a kind and claim the King, or win the final dice-off during the endgame. The player who ultimately possesses the King at the end of the game wins.

2. **Components**  
   - 60 character cards  
   - 12 dice  
   - 1 starting player marker  
   - 5 player aid cards  

3. **Setup**  
   - **Player Count Adjustment**:  
     Use only the number of character cards matching the number of players. For fewer than 5 players, remove excess cards per the official distribution (exact breakdown not specified in source, but one court card per player is always available).
   - **Card Layout**:  
     Arrange character cards into rows based on the Roman numeral on the back:  
     - I: Available using 3 dice  
     - II: Require 4 dice to acquire  
     - III: Require 5 dice  
     - IV: Require 6 dice  
     - V: Require 7 dice  
     Cards in the same row may be stacked if duplicates are present. Order within a row is irrelevant.
   - **Starting Player**:  
     The player who most recently visited a castle begins. They take the starting player marker and 3 dice.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   - Play proceeds clockwise.
   - On a player’s turn:
     1. Roll all active dice (initially 3).
     2. At least one die must be set aside after each roll.
     3. Reroll remaining dice.
     4. Repeat until all dice are set aside.
   - After finalizing dice:
     - Check if the result matches the requirement of any available character card.
     - Claim **one** new character card (cannot duplicate unless the card is Courtesan or Impostor, which are exceptions).
     - Use character abilities **during** the turn (before or after rolls), but only once per card per turn.
     - After use, rotate the card sideways to indicate it has been used.
   - **End of Turn**:  
     All used character cards are returned to upright position, ready for next turn.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Dice Pool Management**:  
     Players start with 3 dice. Character cards can add dice or modify values.
   - **Character Abilities (Selected Examples)**:
     - **Pawnbroker**: Requires pip total of 30+ to claim. Ability: Bring a value 4 die into play.
     - **Knight**: Requires five of a kind. Ability: Bring a value 5 die into play.
     - **Magician**: Requires four of a kind. Ability: Change one active die to any value.
     - **Alchemist**: Requires large straight. Ability: Shift pips among three active dice.
     - **Bishop**: Requires three pairs. Ability: Bring a value 6 die into play.
     - **Nobleman**: Requires two triplets. Ability: Add +2 to any number of active dice (maximum value per die is 6).
     - **General**: Requires six of a kind. Ability: Roll two additional dice.
     - **Queen**: First player to claim the King gets the Queen. Ability: Bring a die of any value into play.
     - **King**: Requires seven of a kind. Ability: Gain the Queen; roll last in final runoff; wins ties.
     - **Noblewoman**: Requires full house. Ability: Add +1 to any number of active dice.
   - **Important Rule**: Only **active dice** (those not yet set aside) can be modified. Set-aside dice are locked.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - **Triggering Endgame**:  
     When a player rolls seven of a kind, they may claim the **King** (and automatically gain the **Queen**). They may instead delay and take another character card.
   - After claiming the King:
     - The current round finishes normally.
     - No other player may claim the King.
     - A final round begins.
   - **Final Round**:
     - Starts with the player to the left of the starting player.
     - The player holding the **Queen** rolls **last**.
     - All players attempt to roll the best set of matching dice (e.g., 8 of a kind beats 7).
     - **Ranking**:
       1. Highest number of matching dice.
       2. If tied, highest die value wins.
       3. If still tied, the player who achieved the result first wins — **except** the Queen holder, who wins on a tie.
   - **Victory**:
     - If the Queen holder ties the best roll, they win.
     - Otherwise, the player with the best roll wins — unless the King was taken and not lost in runoff.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Can I use multiple character abilities in one turn?**  
     Yes, one use per card, any number of cards, during your turn.
   - **Can I use a card ability after setting dice aside?**  
     Yes, as long as it affects **active dice** (not yet set aside).
   - **What happens if the King is claimed but the Queen holder wins the final round?**  
     The Queen holder wins the game.
   - **Can I claim the King more than once?**  
     No. Only one King card exists. Once claimed, it cannot be taken by others.
   - **Do I keep character cards between rounds?**  
     Yes. Cards are retained for the entire game.
   - **What if a character card stack runs out?**  
     That character is no longer available for the rest of the game.
