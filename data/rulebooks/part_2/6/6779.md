### 1. Lore & Objective
In *The Ark of the Covenant*, players help develop the Promised Land by building roads, cities, temples, and fields while deploying followers and prophets to gain influence and score points. The game is inspired by biblical themes, with players guiding the movement of the Ark of the Covenant and preaching repentance through prophets in cities.

**Objective**: Score the most points by completing roads, cities, and temples; strategically moving the Ark of the Covenant; and controlling fields at the end of the game.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
On a player’s turn, perform these steps **in order**:

1. **Draw and Place a Land Tile**
   - Draw one tile and place it adjacent to an existing tile (edge-to-edge, not diagonal).
   - All features (city, road, field) must continue or match on connecting edges.
   - If no legal placement exists (agreed by all), discard and draw a replacement.

2. **Choose One Action**:
   - **A. Place a Follower**: On the just-placed tile, on a city, road, or field segment.
   - **B. Place Prophet**: Instead of a follower, place your Prophet in a **city** segment (only once per game).
   - **C. Move the Ark**: After the Ark is on the board, move it 1–5 tiles. Cannot backtrack or revisit tiles during the same move.
   - **D. Pass**: Take no action.

3. **Score Completed Features**:
   - Immediately score any **completed roads, cities, or temples** resulting from the tile placement.
   - Return followers from scored roads and cities to their owners’ supplies.
   - Prophets are removed from the game after scoring.

4. **Next Player’s Turn Begins**

> **Note**: The Ark of the Covenant is **not placed until the first city is completed**. The player who completes it places the Ark on any tile of that city.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Placing Followers
- Only one follower per turn.
- Must be placed on the **tile just played**.
- Cannot place on a feature (road, city, field) that connects to a segment already occupied by any player’s follower.
- Followers in **fields remain until endgame**; others may return when features are scored.

#### Placing Prophets
- Each player may use their Prophet **once per game**.
- Place only in a **city** segment (instead of a follower).
- When the city is completed:
  - The owner scores **double points** for the city.
  - The Prophet is **removed from the game**.
- For scoring control: a Prophet counts as **one follower**.

#### Moving the Ark of the Covenant
- Begins when the **first city is completed**.
- On a turn, instead of placing a follower, a player may move the Ark **1–5 tiles**.
- Movement rules:
  - Must move along **adjacent tiles** (orthogonal only).
  - Cannot move onto a tile already visited during the same move (no backtracking).
  - Cannot end movement on the **starting tile** (per player aid).
- Each **follower passed** (including the final tile) earns **1 point** for its owner.
- The Ark **does not score** for the tile it starts on unless moved off and back.

#### Scoring Completed Features

##### Completed Road
- Ends at cities, temples, or crossings (or forms a loop).
- Score: **1 point per tile** in the road.
- **+1 point per oasis** connected to the road.
- The player with the most followers on the road scores. Ties: all tied players score full points.

##### Completed City
- Fully enclosed by walls with no gaps.
- Score: **2 points per tile** in the city.
- **+2 points per scroll** icon in the city.
- Prophet doubles the score for its owner.
- Most followers win; ties share full points.

##### Completed Temple
- Formed when the temple tile has tiles on **all four orthogonal sides** (cross shape).
- First, score any **roads completed** by the last surrounding tile (and remove those followers).
- Then, score the temple: **7 points** to player with **most followers** on the **four surrounding tiles or temple tile**.
- Ties: all tied players score 7 points.

#### Returning Followers
- After scoring a **road or city**, all followers on it return to their owners’ supplies.
- A player may place a follower, complete a feature, score, and return the follower **all in one turn**.

#### The Fields
- Fields are continuous field segments bounded by roads, cities, and edges.
- Followers placed in fields **remain until endgame**.
- When two or more fields are joined by a tile, they become a single field.
- Multiple players may have followers in one field.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Game End
- The game ends **immediately after the last tile is placed**.
- Final scoring occurs.

#### Final Scoring

1. **Incomplete Temples**
   - For each temple with surrounding tiles on all four sides (but not fully surrounded in cross?), score **3 points** to player(s) with **majority** of followers on the temple and adjacent four tiles.
   - Followers remain on board for later scoring.

2. **Incomplete Roads and Cities**
   - Score **1 point per segment** (tile) in the feature.
   - **+1 point per scroll (city)** or **oasis (road)**.
   - Most followers score; ties share full points.
   - Remove followers after scoring to simplify.

3. **Fields**
   - For each field:
     - Count **sheep** and **wolves**.
     - Each wolf eats one sheep (cancel one-to-one).
     - Remaining sheep: **2 points each**.
   - Player with **most followers** in the field scores.
   - Ties: all tied players score full points.

#### Winning
- The player with the **highest total score** wins.
