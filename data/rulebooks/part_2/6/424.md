## 1870 - Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *1870: Railroading Across the Trans-Mississippi*, players invest in and operate railroad companies across the American West during the post-Civil War expansion era. The goal is to maximize personal wealth through strategic stock manipulation, efficient route operation, and timely train upgrades. The game ends when the bank runs out of money, a certificate set is completed, or a corporation goes bankrupt—triggering an immediate end.

### 2. Components  
- Game board depicting the Trans-Mississippi U.S. with cities, towns, and hexes  
- Tile set for yellow, green, russet, and gray city/town upgrades  
- Train cards by phase  
- Private company cards  
- Stock certificates (IPO, bank pool, and player-held)  
- Corporation tokens (home and station)  
- Stock market with price tokens and movement rules  
- Money (in various denominations)  

*(Specific counts not provided in source; assumed standard 18XX conventions.)*

### 3. Setup  
- Each public corporation starts with full capitalization upon formation.  
- President of a new corporation buys into the company at par value (68–100) and sets the initial stock price.  
- Corporation places its home token in an eligible city during its first Operating Round.  
- 60% of shares must be sold (floated) for a corporation to begin operations (Frisco is an exception).  
- Yellow, green, russet, and gray tiles are available per upgrade chart.  
- Private companies are available for purchase starting in Phase 2 at ½ to 2× face value.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game alternates between **Stock Rounds (SR)** and **Operating Rounds (OR)**.  
- Stock Rounds occur before each set of Operating Rounds.  
- Operating Rounds proceed in player order, with each corporation operating once per OR.

#### Stock Round Actions (in any order):  
1. Buy one certificate from the IPO or bank pool (except Brown Zone stocks—may buy multiple).  
2. Sell any number of certificates (subject to limits).  
3. Pass.  
4. Buy or sell private companies between players.  
5. Corporation President may:  
   - **Price Protect**: After a sale, if shares were sold and the president has space, funds, desire, and ability (hasn’t sold that stock), must buy *all* shares sold that turn or none. This can exceed 60%.  
   - **Redeem Shares**: Buy one share per SR from bank pool (first) or players (who may refuse). Corporation must have operated; cannot change president; must leave at least 6 shares outstanding.  
   - **Reissue Shares**: If no IPO shares remain, reissue at greater of par value or 75% of current market price (using top row if >200). All-or-none, once per SR.

#### Stock Market Rules:  
- Stock moves:  
  - Right → Full dividend paid  
  - Stationary → Half dividend paid (rounded to nearest $10 in company’s favor)  
  - Left → No dividend paid (withhold)  
  - Down → One space per 10% of shares sold (unprotected)  
  - Up → One space if all shares sold out (or down & right if topped)  
- **Ledge Rule**: Requires two 10% sales to drop from a ledge (immediately above).  
- **Certificate Limits**:  
  - Standard: Cannot own more than certificate limit.  
  - Yellow Zone: Does not count toward cert limit.  
  - Orange & Brown Zones: Do not count toward cert limit, can own >60%, Brown allows buying multiple shares at once (only one from IPO).

#### Operating Round Sequence:  
1. **Privates Pay**: Private companies pay revenue to owner (player or corporation).  
2. **Lay Track**:  
   - Lay 2 yellow tiles, or  
   - Upgrade 1 tile (yellow → green, green → russet, russet → gray, per tile chart).  
3. **Place Token**: Corporation may place a station token in a city it can reach by train.  
4. **Run Routes**:  
   - Must run a legal route (train can physically reach).  
   - Choose one of:  
     a. **Pay Full Dividend**: Revenue to treasury and shareholders; bank pool money is lost. Stock moves right.  
     b. **Pay Half Dividend**: Revenue split (round to nearest $10 in company’s favor); stock price unchanged.  
     c. **Withhold**: All revenue to treasury; stock moves left.  
5. **Purchase Trains**:  
   - Corporation **must** buy a train if it has a legal route.  
   - Train phase determines available types and rusting.  
6. **Connection Run Check**:  
   - After each corporation operates, check if all corporations have been connected via legal routes.  
   - If yes, **Connection Run** is triggered:  
     - Any corporation may place a destination marker for free.  
     - That corporation gets a free Operating Round (for route running only).  
     - Future runs that start or end at the destination **double its value**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Stock Ownership**:  
  - Max 60% personal ownership (exceptions: Green/Brown Zone stocks and price protection).  
  - Cannot buy a stock you sold this round.  
  - Max 50% of a corporation may be in the stock market (IPO + bank pool).  
- **Train Phases**:  
  - Trains become available and obsolete (rust) per phase.  
  - Train limits per corporation apply (exact numbers not specified in source).  
- **Tile Upgrades**:  
  - Towns: empty → yellow → green → russet  
  - Cities: empty → yellow → green → russet → gray  
  - Specific tile numbers listed (e.g., 143, 146, 170, etc.), with quantities.  
- **Private Companies**:  
  - Can be bought between players.  
  - Purchased by corporations starting in Phase 2 at ½ to 2× face value.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Triggers (immediate end):**  
- Bank runs out of money.  
- Completion of a certificate set (e.g., all shares of a type sold).  
- Bankruptcy of any corporation.  

**Final Scoring:**  
- Player’s wealth = cash on hand + value of owned stock (current market price).  
- Stock value is determined at final market position.  
- No additional operations or stock actions after trigger.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Price Protection**: President must act immediately after a sale of their stock. Must buy *all* shares sold that turn or none. Can exceed 60% ownership.  
- **Redemption**: Only one share per SR. Bank pool must be exhausted before buying from players. Corporation must have operated previously.  
- **Reissuance**: Only allowed if no IPO shares remain. Price is greater of par or 75% current market (closed value).  
- **Certificate Limits**: Yellow/Orange/Brown zone stocks ignore cert and 60% limits.  
- **Connection Run**: Free OR only for running routes. Does not allow track laying or train buying.  
- **Train Purchase**: Mandatory if a legal route exists—even if no train is needed immediately.  
- **Stock Movement on Withhold**: Always moves left. On full pay: right. Half pay: stationary.
