## River Dragons — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the Mekong Delta, young bridge builders compete to cross the river using planks and stones. Players program actions to build bridges, move across them, and reach their destination village. The first player to reach their destination wins the game immediately.

2. Components  
- 1 game board (featuring river, islands, starting and destination villages)  
- 6 pawns (3 girls, 3 boys, in 6 different colors)  
- 36 numbered planks (6 colors, 6 sizes per color: 1–6)  
- 27 stones  
- 78 action cards (13 per color: 6 colors)  
- 1 first player card  

3. Setup  
- Place the board in the center with islands visible.  
- Place all 27 stones in a shared reserve near the board.  
- Determine player count (2–6). Unused player colors/villages are removed from play.  
- Each player:  
  - Chooses a color and takes the matching pawn and 6 planks (sizes 1–6) of that color.  
  - Takes 13 action cards of their color.  
  - Removes from their hand all Dragon cards that correspond to unused player colors.  
  - Places their pawn on their starting village.  
  - Places their planks in front of them as a personal reserve.  
- The youngest player takes the first player card and places it in front of them.

4. Gameplay Flow  
A turn consists of two phases:  
1. **Programming Phase**  
   - Each player selects 5 action cards from their hand.  
   - Cards are placed face down in a chosen order (left to right).  
   - Once placed, cards cannot be changed or rearranged.  
2. **Action/Resolution Phase**  
   - All players reveal their first card simultaneously.  
   - Starting with the first player, each player resolves their action in clockwise order.  
   - Repeat for the 2nd through 5th cards.  
   - After all 5 actions are resolved:  
     a. The first player card is passed clockwise.  
     b. All players retrieve their 5 used cards back into their hand.  
     c. A new turn begins.  

5. Core Mechanics  
**Action Types (on cards):**  
- **Place 1 Stone / Place 2 Stones**  
  - Place 1 or 2 stones on any unoccupied island.  
  - Each island holds only 1 stone.  
  - Cannot place stones on villages.  
  - Once placed, stones cannot be moved unless removed by "Remove" action.  
  - If no stones are available when required, the action is lost.  

- **1 Movement / 2 Movements**  
  - Move pawn 1 or 2 steps.  
  - Each plank holds only 1 pawn; villages hold unlimited pawns.  
  - Movement can be in any direction over any colored plank.  
  - If no legal move is possible, pawn returns to starting village.  
  - With 2 movements, a U-turn is allowed (can end on starting plank).  

- **Place 1 Plank / Place 2 Planks**  
  - Place plank(s) between:  
    - Two stones, or  
    - One stone and one village.  
  - Plank must be fully supported at both ends.  
  - Plank can overhang stone/village but cannot be too short.  
  - If no valid placement exists for a plank, it is removed from the game.  
  - Once chosen, plank cannot be swapped.  
  - Cannot place a plank on another plank unless both ends are supported by stone or village.  
  - No more than 3 planks may connect to a single stone or village.  

- **Remove 1 Plank or 1 Stone**  
  - Choose to remove:  
    - A plank (any color) not occupied by a pawn, returning it to owner’s reserve.  
    - A stone not supporting any plank, returning it to the shared reserve.  
  - Restrictions:  
    - Cannot remove a plank occupied by a pawn.  
    - Cannot remove a stone supporting any plank.  
    - Cannot have more than 2 plank colors in personal reserve.  
    - Cannot have two planks of the same number (size) in reserve.  
  - If no legal removal is possible, action is lost.  

- **Jump Over Another Pawn**  
  - Jump over a pawn on an adjacent plank.  
  - Landing space (village or unoccupied plank) must be available.  
  - Effect equals a 2-Movement action (can move two segments).  
  - If no jump is possible, pawn falls into the river and returns to starting village.  

- **Dragon Card**  
  - Cancels the action of the same sequence position (1st to 5th) for the targeted player color.  
  - A player may play at most one Dragon card per turn.  
  - Dragon cards cannot be canceled by other Dragon cards.  
  - If multiple Dragon cards are played in the same position, all take effect.  
  - Players must remove Dragon cards of unused colors from their hand before the game.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is **no scoring**.  
- The game ends **immediately** when any player moves their pawn onto their destination village.  
- That player wins the game instantly, regardless of remaining actions or turns.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a plank that overhangs a stone?**  
  Yes, overhang is allowed. Only stability (full support at both ends) matters.  
- **Can I move over planks of other colors?**  
  Yes, pawn movement is not restricted by plank color.  
- **Can I use the same plank twice?**  
  No, each plank is unique by size and color. You may reuse your own planks only if removed from the board.  
- **What if I cannot place a plank I selected?**  
  If no valid placement exists, the plank is removed from the game and cannot be used again.  
- **Can I jump and land on the same plank I started on?**  
  Yes, as long as the jump is over an adjacent pawn and the path allows a two-segment movement.  
- **Can two Dragon cards cancel each other?**  
  No. Dragon cards cannot be canceled. If two are played in the same position, both effects apply.  
- **Can I remove a plank and immediately reuse it?**  
  Yes, removed planks return to your reserve and can be placed in a future action.  
- **What happens if I run out of stones?**  
  If a "Place Stone" action is played but no stones are available, the action is lost.
