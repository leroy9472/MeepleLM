## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
- Set during the Cold War, players assume the role of spymasters for either the United States (White) or the USSR (Red).  
- The objective is to gain control of the Top Secret Briefcase and move it to the opponent’s first row (i.e., the opposite side of the 11×11 board).  
- Victory is achieved when one of your Spies carries the Briefcase to the opponent’s first row.

2. Components  
- 26 Spy Pieces (13 per player)  
- 26 Movement Pieces (13 per player), each indicating movement capabilities  
- 1 Top Secret Briefcase  
- 1 Game Board (11×11 grid)  
- 2 Spy Notebooks (labeled “My Spies” and “Opponent’s Spies”)  
- 2 Dry Erase Markers  
- 1 Punchboard with 6 Special Action Tokens (3 per player: Reveal 1, Move 2, Swap 2)  
- Rulebook

3. Setup  
1. Choose sides: White (USA) or Red (USSR).  
2. Each player prepares their opponent’s Spies:  
   a. Shuffle the opponent’s Movement Pieces face down (non-promoted side up).  
   b. Randomly insert one Movement Piece into each Spy, ensuring the non-promoted side faces outward.  
   c. Place each of the opponent’s 13 Spies on their designated starting positions (per Setup Diagram), with the Movement Piece facing the player doing the setup (i.e., hidden from the opponent).  
3. The opponent simultaneously sets up your Spies in the same way.  
4. Place the Top Secret Briefcase on the central square of the board.  
5. Give each player their matching-color Notebook and a dry erase marker.  
6. Determine who goes first.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Players take turns in alternating order.  
- On your turn:  
  1. Announce a move with one of your Spies.  
  2. Your opponent responds:  
     - “Yes”: the move is legal. Execute it.  
     - “No”: the move is illegal. Return the Spy to its original square.  
  3. If the move lands on an enemy Spy, capture it (remove without revealing its Movement Piece).  
  4. Both players record deductions in their Notebooks.  
- Optional: Before moving, you may use one Special Action Token (if available and not using a Double Agent elimination action).  
- Turn ends after move attempt and recording.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Movement:  
  - Each Spy moves in straight lines (orthogonal or diagonal) up to the distance and direction shown on its hidden Movement Piece.  
  - A Spy may move less than its maximum distance but cannot change direction mid-move.  
  - Spies cannot jump over other Spies or the Briefcase.  
  - You cannot move onto a square occupied by your own Spy.  
  - Opponent’s Movement Pieces are visible from your perspective: “up” means toward opponent, “down” toward you.  
- Capturing:  
  - Moving onto an enemy Spy’s square captures and removes it.  
- Notebooks:  
  - Use to track possible movement types for each Spy.  
  - Cross out movement types that are ruled out by failed or successful moves.  
  - “My Spies” section tracks your deductions.  
  - “Opponent’s Spies” section tracks what you believe your opponent knows about their own Spies.  
- Double Agent:  
  - One of your 13 Spies has a Movement Piece with a “?” (question mark).  
  - Your opponent controls its movement legality: they may answer “Yes” or “No” freely for any move attempt.  
  - You may eliminate your own Double Agent at any turn (before moving) by removing one of your Spies without revealing its Movement Piece. This action is free and may be repeated in consecutive turns.  
  - You may eliminate the opponent’s Double Agent by removing their Spy and revealing its Movement Piece to confirm it is the Double Agent. This action is also free and may be done only once.  
  - You cannot perform both elimination actions in the same turn.  
  - The Double Agent can win the game if your opponent allows it to carry the Briefcase to their first row.  
- Promoting Spies:  
  - Four Spies per side are promotable (identified by a Crown icon and inability to move backward).  
  - When such a Spy reaches any square on the opponent’s edge (first row), the opponent announces promotion and flips the Movement Piece to its “Promoted” side (which shows different movement).  
  - The original movement is not revealed.  
- Top Secret Briefcase:  
  - To gain control: move a Spy legally onto the Briefcase’s square (capturing an enemy Spy if present). Place the Spy on top of the Briefcase.  
  - When moving a Spy that controls the Briefcase, you have three options:  
    1. Move the Spy without the Briefcase (lose control).  
    2. Move the Spy carrying the Briefcase (maintain control; capture enemy Spies normally).  
    3. Move only the Briefcase (same movement as the controlling Spy). The Briefcase may end on a square with a Spy:  
       - If it’s your Spy, that Spy gains control.  
       - If it’s an enemy Spy, that Spy gains control (rarely advisable).  
       - If vacant, no one controls the Briefcase.  
  - The Briefcase cannot jump over Spies.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends immediately when a player moves a Spy carrying the Briefcase to any square in the opponent’s first row.  
- That player wins.  
- Optional Variant (Safe Extraction): The controlling Spy must survive one full turn in the opponent’s first row to win.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can a Spy move zero spaces? No. A move must change position.  
- Can the Briefcase be moved to a square with a captured Spy? No—capture occurs during a Spy move, not a Briefcase move.  
- If a move is denied, is anything recorded? Yes—both players record what was learned (e.g., the Spy cannot move in that direction/distance).  
- Can you move the Briefcase onto your own Spy to transfer control? Yes.  
- Can you promote a Spy and then move it in the same turn? Yes.  
- What if all your Spies are eliminated? The game continues as long as the Briefcase is in play. You can still win by capturing it with a remaining Spy.  
- Can the Briefcase be captured mid-move? No—it only changes control when a Spy lands on its square or it is moved onto a Spy.
