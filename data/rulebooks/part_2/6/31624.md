## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
The year is 1430, during a time of unrest in the Holy Roman Empire. The region of Upper Lusatia, protected by the League of Six—a confederation of six wealthy towns—remains prosperous despite surrounding conflicts like the Hussite Wars. Players take on the role of ambitious tax collectors seeking favor with King Sigismund.  

**Objective**: Gain the most influence points by collecting goods, managing resources, and earning support from civic leaders. The player with the highest influence at the end of six rounds wins.

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the **countryside board** in the center. Randomly place the **6 town tiles** around its edges. For first games, use the white side (numbered towns); later, use yellow or mix.  
2. Place the **scoreboard** nearby. Each player starts with **10 influence points**—place one of their markers on the "crown" space (10) on the scoreboard.  
3. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
   - 1 figure (for movement)  
   - 1 scoring marker (already placed at 10)  
   - 1 turn-order marker (placed randomly in one of the six central circles on the countryside board—no duplicates)  
4. From the **civic leader cards**, separate those with **gray backgrounds** and place them face-up near the scoreboard. Sort the remaining cards into **4 face-down piles** by number of figures (1, 2, 3, or 4 figures per card). Shuffle each pile and place on matching spots on the scoreboard.  
5. Each player receives **3 guard cards (each with 1 guard)**. Remaining guards go to the supply. Guard cards are **hidden information**.  
6. Each player takes their **waggon tile** and places it in front of them.  
7. Set **storage tiles** to side "I" (rounds 1–3), shuffle, split into two piles of 3:  
   - One pile for **royal stores** (left, with crown icon)  
   - One pile for **civic stores** (right, with citizen icon)  
8. Shuffle the **hexagonal tax tiles** and place face-down as a draw pile.  
9. Place wooden blocks and horse tiles in supply.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **6 rounds**, each representing one year. Each round has **6 phases**:

#### Phase 1: Setup  
- Reveal the top card of each of the **4 civic leader piles** (gray-back cards remain separate).  
- Shuffle the **6 town/Hussite cards**, then draw:  
  - 3 cards for 3 players  
  - 2 cards for 4 players  
  - 1 card for 5 players  
  Place drawn cards on corresponding town tiles (Hussite side up) — these towns are **under siege** and **cannot be taxed**.  
- Place **one tax tile** face-up in the center of each **non-besieged town**.

#### Phase 2: Choosing Towns  
Players act in order based on turn-order markers (fewest guards → most, per phase 2 arrow).  
- In **Round 1**, players place their figure directly.  
- In **Rounds 2–6**, players start on the road outside their previous town and must **move** to a new town.

To choose a town:  
- If the town is **empty**, place your figure on the **0-guards** space.  
- If **occupied**, you must **offer more guards** than the current occupant by placing your figure on a higher-numbered guard space (e.g., 2, 3, etc.).  

The current occupant has two choices:  
1. **Accept the offer**: Take the offered guards, then **move to another town** (paying 1 guard per town passed, including adjacent).  
2. **Counter-offer**: Place their figure on a higher space, restarting the bidding.  

Bidding continues until one player accepts. Maximum bid is **12 guards** — at that point, the other player must accept.  
- If a player cannot pay guards offered, they may **buy from the king**: pay **2 influence points per missing guard** (move scoring marker back). Cannot go below 0.  
- Movement cost: 1 guard per town entered (adjacent = 1, opposite = 3). Even **staying in place** costs **1 guard** (move from road to guard space).  

This continues until all players are in separate towns.

#### Phase 3: Reordering  
Reorder turn-order markers based on **guards spent** during town selection:  
- Highest spent → first in next phase  
- Tiebreaker: higher-numbered **town** takes precedence  

Markers are placed on the central board in descending order.

#### Phase 4: Tax Collection  
In order (highest guard spent → lowest), players:  
- Rotate their **tax tile** in their current town to align arrows with desired resources on the town tile.  
- Collect:  
  - **Goods (colored blocks)**: One per matching symbol pointed to. Place on waggon.  
  - **Guards**: One per symbol. Take from supply (can use 3-guard cards). Can exchange 3×1-guard ↔ 1×3-guard card at any time.  
  - **Horses (silver symbols)**: No immediate reward. Used in next phase for turn order.  
  - **Center symbols (clergy, aristocracy, burghers)**: Take **one gray-back civic leader card** per matching figure shown. Cards are **hidden**.  

Later players can react to earlier choices.

#### Phase 5: Storing Goods  
Determine **storage order** by number of **horses collected**:  
- Most horses → 5-horse tile, then 4, 3, 2, 1  
- Tiebreaker: higher-numbered town wins  

Players take turns:  
1. Choose an **incomplete row** from either **royal stores** (left) or **civic stores** (right).  
2. Must place **all matching goods** they have in that row.  
3. Score **points shown in each space** immediately.  
4. If row not filled, next players (clockwise) add goods they have.  
5. Row complete? The **player who chose it** gets a bonus:  
   - **Royal store**: Gain bonus points (leftmost number)  
   - **Civic store**: Take one **face-up civic leader card** from a pile with that number or lower (e.g., if bonus is "3", can take from pile 3 or 2 or 1). Do **not** reveal a new card. If no eligible cards, no bonus.  

Repeat: next-fastest horse player chooses new row.  
Continue until no one can place more goods.  
**Unplaced goods are discarded**.

#### Phase 6: Cleanup  
- Return **Hussite cards** to deck, shuffle.  
- Discard used **tax tiles**.  
- Move all player **figures to road** outside current town.  
- Remove **face-up civic leader cards** (not taken) — return to box.  
- Return **horse tiles** to supply.  
- Remove **goods** from storage tiles.  
- Remove **top storage tile** from each pile (royal and civic).  
- After **Round 3**, refill piles using side "II" of storage tiles.  
- After **Round 6**, game ends.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Guard Economy**: Guards are currency for movement and conflict. Can be bought from king at 2 influence each.  
- **Hidden Information**: Guard and civic leader cards are private.  
- **Resource Allocation**: Goods must be stored or lost. Strategic row selection is key.  
- **Dynamic Turn Order**: Changes every round based on player actions.  
- **Civic Leader Scoring**: Endgame points based on majority in clergy, aristocracy, burghers.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after **Round 6**. Final scoring:  
1. **Influence Points**: Total from scoreboard.  
2. **Civic Leader Cards**: Reveal all. For each group (clergy, aristocracy, burghers):  
   - Rank players by total number of figures in that group.  
   - Score:  
     - 1st: 9 pts  
     - 2nd: 6 pts  
     - 3rd: 4 pts  
     - 4th: 2 pts  
   - **Ties**:  
     - Break by **guards in hand** (more wins).  
     - If still tied, all tied players get **lower score**.  
   - **3-player games**: No 1st-place points.  
     - 1st: 6 pts, 2nd: 4 pts, 3rd: 2 pts  
   - **4-player games**: Last place still scores if has at least one card.  
   - **No card = 0 pts**, even if others have none.

**Final Winner**: Highest total influence.  
**Tiebreaker**: Most guards remaining in hand.
