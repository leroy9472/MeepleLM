## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Chronicle is a trick-taking card game where players compete over multiple rounds to earn Fame points by fulfilling victory conditions revealed at the start of each round. The ultimate goal is to be the first player to reach 3 or more Fame points and have the highest total when the game ends.

### 2. Components  
- **36 Character Cards**: Numbered cards (1–10), face cards (Sage, Fool, Angel, Demon, Dragon, King), and Wild Cards. These are dealt to players each round.  
- **History Deck**: A deck of cards that determine the round’s victory condition and the Lead Card for the first Meeting.  
- **Allies Pile**: Where players collect cards won during Meetings.  
- **Discard Pile**: For cards removed from play due to abilities; only the top card is visible.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Reveal History Card**:  
   - Reveal and read the top card of the History Deck. Note:  
     - The **victory condition(s)** for the round.  
     - The **Lead Card** — identifies who starts the first Meeting.  
2. **Deal Character Cards**:  
   - The dealer shuffles the 36 Character Cards and deals all cards face down to the players.  
   - **In a 5-player game only**:  
     - Before dealing, reveal the top Character Card.  
     - Discard it unless it is the Lead Card for the round.  
     - If it *is* the Lead Card, shuffle it back in, then reveal and discard a different card.  
3. **Determine First Leader**:  
   - The player holding the Lead Card reveals it and becomes the starting player.  
   - They do **not** have to lead with the Lead Card — any card from hand may be used.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of a series of tricks called **Meetings**, continuing until at least one player plays their last hand card.

#### Each Meeting:
1. **Lead and Play Cards**:  
   - The leading player plays one card face up.  
   - Play proceeds clockwise. Each player must play one card, obeying these rules:  
     - Must follow the **lead suit** if possible.  
     - If unable to follow suit, must play **any card face down** — this card has **no strength** and **does not activate its power**.  
     - May play a **Wild Card face up** at any time (even when able to follow suit).  

   > **Note 1**: If the lead card is a Wild Card, the **first non-Wild card** played determines the lead suit.  
   > **Note 2**: A player may lose their last card due to a card ability (e.g., stolen by Strength 8) before playing. They skip their turn if they have no card.

2. **Resolve Immediate Abilities**:  
   - As soon as a card with an immediate ability is played, resolve it:  
     - **3–10, Sage, Fool**: Cards with numbers or special roles may have immediate effects (e.g., stealing, discarding).  
   - Rules:  
     - If an ability can be applied, it **must** be applied as fully as possible.  
     - A card may be played even if its ability cannot trigger.  
   - Discarded cards go to the **discard pile**, face up (only top card visible).

3. **Resolve End-of-Meeting Abilities**:  
   - After all players have played, resolve any "End of Meeting" abilities in play order:  
     - **Demon, Dragon, King**: These trigger at the end of the Meeting.

4. **Determine Meeting Winner**:  
   - The player who played the **highest-strength card in the lead suit** wins the Meeting.  
     - Wild Cards have **no strength** and do not contribute.  
     - If a card ability explicitly changes the winner, that takes precedence.  
   - **Tiebreaker (3-player game only)**:  
     - If Sage, Fool, and Angel are all played in one Meeting and a tie occurs, the **leading player** wins the Meeting.

5. **Collect Cards and Pass Lead**:  
   - The winner collects all cards played in the Meeting and places them face up in their **Allies** pile.  
   - The winner becomes the **leading player** for the next Meeting.

6. **Repeat**:  
   - Continue Meetings until at least one player plays their last hand card.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Suits and Following Suit**:  
  - Players must follow the lead suit if they can.  
  - Failure to follow: play a card **face down** (no strength, no ability).  
- **Wild Cards**:  
  - Can be played at any time, face up.  
  - Have **no suit or strength**.  
  - Do not set the lead suit unless a non-Wild card follows.  
- **Card Abilities**:  
  - **Immediate (3–10, Sage, Fool)**: Trigger when played.  
  - **End of Meeting (Demon, Dragon, King)**: Trigger after all cards are played.  
  - **Angel**: Triggers at **end of round** — removes Evil cards.  
  - **Strength 8**: Can steal another player’s card (example given).  
- **Fame Points**: Awarded based on History Card conditions or Evil Victory.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### End of Round:
1. **Remaining Hand Cards**: All players add any leftover hand cards to their Allies pile.  
2. **Angel Effect**: The player with the **Angel** in Allies discards all **Evil cards** (Demon Wild Card and all Strength 1 cards).  
3. **Evil Disqualification**: Any player with **one or more Evil cards** in Allies is **excluded from scoring**.  
4. **Normal Scoring**:  
   - Among non-disqualified players, those who best fulfill the **History Card condition(s)** earn **1 Fame point** each.  
   - Wild Cards have **no suit**, so they do not help fulfill suit-based conditions.  
5. **Special Evil Victory**:  
   - If **one player** has all **four Evil Cards** (3x Strength 1 + Demon) after Angel effect:  
     - They gain **2 Fame points**.  
     - All other players gain **0 Fame** this round.

#### End of Game:
- The game ends **at the end of the round** when **one or more players have 3 or more Fame points**.  
- The player with the **most Fame points** wins.  
- **Tie**: Play additional rounds until the tie is broken.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a player play a Wild Card even if they can follow suit?**  
  Yes. Wild Cards can be played at any time, face up.  
- **What happens if a player has no cards due to a steal effect?**  
  They do not play into the current Meeting. The Meeting continues with remaining players.  
- **Can a face-down card win a Meeting?**  
  No. Face-down cards have no strength and cannot win.  
- **Is the Lead Card required to be played first?**  
  No. It only determines who leads the first Meeting.  
- **What if the Lead Card is discarded in a 5-player game?**  
  It is shuffled back in, and a different card is revealed and discarded.  
- **Do Wild Cards count toward victory conditions?**  
  No. Wild Cards have no suit and do not contribute to suit-based or card-based conditions.  
- **Can the Angel protect itself from disqualification?**  
  Yes — the Angel allows its owner to discard all Evil cards, potentially avoiding disqualification.
