#### Board & Shared Elements  
- Place the game board in the center.
- Place 12 green VP markers next to the board.

- Shuffle all extra office cards to form a face-down supply:
  - Start with Section 5 office card (face down)
  - Add shuffled Section 4 cards on top
  - Continue up to Section 1 cards on top
- Draw the top office card and place it in the first window (Section 1 column) of the federal department.

#### Action Card Supply  
- For each section (V down to II):
  - Place a number of Section X action cards equal to the number of players, face down.
  - Shuffle remaining Section X cards and place them on top.
- Place this stack beside the board (bottom right).
- Exception for 2-player game: Remove cards 23, 32, and 49 before shuffling.

#### Street Cards (Section I)  
- Shuffle all Section I action cards.
- Place them face up on the 11 street spaces at the bottom of the board, left to right.
- Exception for 2-player game: Card 23 is removed, so draw an extra card from the supply to fill the 11th space.

#### Normal Offices (3–4 players only)  
- 3 players: Add one "3–4" normal office card to the round window left of offices.
- 4 players: Add one "3–4" and one "4" normal office card.
- 2 players: No normal office cards used; keep in box.

#### Player Setup  
Each player:
- Takes one full set (A–D): 10 cards (7 money, 3 VP), 3 campaign workers, 2 playing pieces, 1 overview card.
- Shuffles their 10-card deck and places it face down as their draw pile.
- Places one playing piece on space 0 of the career path.
- Places the other playing piece randomly on a window of the bus to determine preliminary player order.
- Keeps 4 additional campaign workers (from their color pool) next to the board for later use.

#### Player Zones  
Each player organizes their area with:
- **Draw pile**: Face-down action cards  
- **Play area**: Face-up played cards (during round)  
- **Temporary clipboard**: Face-up, rotated 90° – for cards used in Phase 1 or traded  
- **Discard pile**: Face-up – receives cards from play area and clipboard at round end

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round consists of **4 phases**:

#### Phase 1: PLANNING  
1. Each player draws 5 cards from their draw pile.  
2. Each player selects **one card** face down to bid for turn order.  
   - The card’s top-left number determines initiative.  
   - Highest number goes first; ties are broken by reversing previous round’s relative order.  
3. Players reveal cards. Turn order is set.  
4. Selected cards are placed **face up, rotated 90°**, into the temporary clipboard.  

#### Phase 2: ACTION  
Players take turns in current order, placing campaign workers and using actions.

- Players alternate placing **one campaign worker** at a time into an **empty office**.
  - Each office holds only one worker.
  - If VP markers are on the office, the player collects them.
- Before or after placing a worker, a player may:
  - Play cards from hand
  - Use actions from offices where they have a worker
- When used:
  - Campaign workers are laid **on their side** to indicate use.
  - Played cards go to the **play area** (face up).
- Play continues until all players pass (no more workers or actions).

#### Phase 3: BUYING & SUCCESS  
In turn order:
1. Players play **all remaining cards** from hand to their play area.
2. If a player has a worker in an office with a **Buy action**, they may:
   - Buy one or more cards from the **Street**.
   - Total money from played cards + “virtual” money from office actions.
   - Must pay any **additional cost** (+number) shown under street cards.
   - Must take any **red cards** to the left of a purchased card.
   - Leftover money is **lost**.
3. Calculate Victory Points:
   - From played cards (green VP value)
   - From offices with workers (VP icons)
   - From collected VP markers
   - Move total VP forward on the track.
   - Return used VP markers to the pool.

#### Phase 4: CLEAN-UP  
1. Place **one VP marker** on each **empty office**.
2. Move all cards from:
   - Play area → discard pile
   - Clipboard → discard pile
3. Remove all campaign workers:
   - Return **temporary** workers to the pool
   - Keep permanent ones (if any)
4. Draw next **extra office card** and place it in the correct section column.
5. Remove **unpurchased street cards**:
   - Remove leftmost cards equal to the number of players.
   - Refill street with new cards from the supply (Section I stack) to restore 11 cards.

Then begin next round.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: What happens to leftover money after buying?**  
A: It is forfeited. No carryover.

A: If bid values are tied, reverse the relative order from the previous round.

**Q: Do I have to use all my campaign workers?**

**Q: What happens when the draw pile runs out?**  
A: Shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.

A: Not directly, but they clog your deck. Must be taken when buying a card to their right.
