## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Samarkand is a strategic trading game set along the Silk Road, where players represent merchants seeking to build wealth and influence through marriage alliances and trade expansion. The goal is to earn the most victory points (VPs) by establishing trade relationships, controlling goods, and accumulating wealth.

### 2. Components  
- Game board showing cities, trade routes, and goods spaces  
- Camels (in multiple colors)  
- Family tiles (one per player per family, plus extras for 2-player variant)  
- Relationship tiles (four total, dark green on top when stacked)  
- Goods markers (representing silk, spice, etc.)  
- Goods cards (matching goods types)  
- Dirham coins (currency)  

### 3. Setup  
- Place one camel of each color on its matching city space.  
- On each family’s domain space:  
  - Place remaining camels of that color  
  - Place two family tiles  
  - Stack four relationship tiles with the dark green tile on top  
- Place all goods markers on their designated board spaces.  
- Shuffle goods cards and deal 2 to each player.  
- Give each player 10 dirhams to start.  

**For 2 Players Only:**  
- Hand limit is 10 cards.  
- Place only one family tile per family on the board; put remaining family tiles into a bag.  
- When marrying into a family, draw a tile from the bag:  
  - If it matches a family already married into by a player, return it to the board.  
  - If it matches an unclaimed family, remove it from the game.  
- Players may marry into the same family twice.  
- Owning both tiles of a family grants no additional benefit beyond normal scoring and trade income.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order. On a turn, a player must perform **one** of the following two actions:  
1. Marry into a family  
2. Expand a family’s trade route  

Play continues until the game end conditions are met.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Marrying Into a Family  
- Pay the marriage portion (amount not specified in rules provided) to the family’s treasury.  
- Take 1 family tile from the family’s domain.  
  - If no family tiles remain, no further marriages into that family are allowed.  
- Players may hold multiple family tiles, but **no more than one tile per family** (except in 2-player game where double marriage is allowed).  
- Draw 3 goods cards, then:  
  - Must keep at least 1 of the drawn cards  
  - May discard any number of cards (from hand or drawn cards)  
  - Final hand size must comply with hand limit:  
    - 3 players: 10 cards  
    - 4 players: 7 cards  
    - 5 players: 6 cards  
  - If at hand limit before marrying, **cannot draw any cards**  
  - Discarded cards go face-down to discard pile  

#### Expanding a Family's Trade Route  
- Place 1 or 2 camels of the same color on the board.  
- Placement rules:  
  - Each camel must be placed in a space adjacent to a space already occupied by that family’s camel  
  - No space may contain more than 2 camels  
  - Camels in the same space must be different colors  
- Cost:  
  - First camel: free  
  - Second camel: costs 1 dirham from the family’s treasury  

#### Goods Spaces  
- When a camel is placed on an **unoccupied goods space**:  
  - The player takes the corresponding goods marker and places it in front of them  
- Any player may **sell a goods marker** at any time for 3 dirhams  
  - Sold goods card is placed face-up in front of the player  
  - Counts toward hand limit  
  - No VP for sold goods at endgame  

#### New Trade Relationship  
Triggered when a camel is placed on a land space already occupied by another family’s camel.  
- **All players with family tiles** from the **placing family** gain 3 dirhams  
- **All players with family tiles** from the **family already present** gain 1 dirham  
- The **active player** takes **one relationship marker** from **each** of the two families involved  

Note: There are only four relationship markers per family (stacked at start). Taking a marker removes it from the board.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End Conditions  
Game ends immediately when **either** of the following occurs:  
- All families have made at least one trade relationship (i.e., **no dark green relationship tile remains on any family stack**)  
- One family has made **five trade relationships** (i.e., all its relationship markers are taken)  

#### Scoring  
Points are awarded as follows:  
- **Cash**: 1 VP per dirham  
- **Relationship Markers**: 1 VP each  
- **Goods Markers (unsold)**: 1 VP each  
- **Goods Cards in Hand**:  
  - 0 VP if the corresponding goods space has **no camel**  
  - 1 VP if the space has a **camel of another family**  
  - 4 VP if the space has a **camel of your family**  
  - Specific cards may be worth 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, or 8 points (values likely on cards)  
- **Sold goods cards** during the game: **0 VP**  

**Victory**: Player with the most VPs wins. In case of a tie, tied players share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you expand a route without adjacent camel?** No. All placements must be adjacent to an existing camel of the same family.  
- **Can two camels be placed in the same turn in non-adjacent spaces?** Yes, as long as each individually satisfies adjacency to an existing camel of that family.  
- **What happens when a family’s treasury is empty?** Rules do not specify; assume payments must be made if required—play may require house ruling.  
- **Do sold goods count toward hand limit?** Yes—face-up in front of player, but still count.  
- **Can you sell a good immediately after taking it?** Yes, unless restricted by timing rules not in text.  
- **Do you get money from trade relationships immediately?** Yes—triggered upon placement.  
- **In 2-player game, what if bag runs out?** Rules imply process continues until marriages no longer possible.
