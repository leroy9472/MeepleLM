## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In the Golden Age of railroads, players are wealthy investors speculating on the fortunes of local railroad companies. By buying shares and building tracks, players manipulate stock prices to maximize their wealth. The goal is to accumulate the highest total profit from retained stocks at the end of the game and become the ultimate Railroad Tycoon.

2. Components  
- 7 Map Tiles (double-sided, one featuring "The Big City" with +5 value)  
- 6 Frame Tiles (colored)  
- 1 Central Market Board  
- 5 Player Profit Boards  
- 10 Player Action Tiles (2 per player: "Buy Shares", "Build Tracks")  
- 10 Player Order Markers (2 per player in 5 colors)  
- 72 Train Company Discs (12 discs in each of 6 colors)  
- 1 Cloth Bag  
- 1 English Rulebook  

3. Setup  
1. Connect the 6 Frame Tiles around the central area. Frames must be aligned to the same side (Side A or Side B) to connect properly.  
2. Place the "The Big City" (+5 hex) tile in the center. Randomly place the remaining 6 Map Tiles around it. Orientation and side (A/B) are random.  
3. Place the Market Board near the map.  
4. Discard and draw setup:  
   - For 4–5 players: Place 1 Company Disc of each color on the starting hexes adjacent to matching frame colors. Put the remaining 66 discs in the bag.  
   - For 3 players: Place 3 discs of each color on the matching starting hexes. Put the remaining 54 discs in the bag.  
5. Each player takes:  
   - 2 Order Markers (same color)  
   - 1 Profit Board  
   - 2 Action Tiles ("Buy Shares", "Build Tracks")  
6. Determine starting player: the player who most recently bought a train ticket.  
7. Player order setup:  
   - Clockwise from the starting player, each player places one marker on the leftmost space of the bottom order track.  
   - Then, counterclockwise from the last player, each places their second marker on the leftmost space of the top order track.  
   - Result: turn order for Round 1 is A, B, C, D, E, E, D, C, B, A (for 5 players).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts exactly 6 rounds. Each round has 3 phases:  
- Draw Phase  
- Action Phase  
- Taxation Phase  

**Draw Phase**  
1. Draw (2 × number of players) + 1 Company Discs randomly from the bag. Place them left to right on the Market Board’s market track.  
2. All players return both Action Tiles ("Buy Shares", "Build Tracks") face-up to their Profit Boards.  

**Action Phase**  
Players take turns in the order of markers on the order track (left to right). Each player must take each of the two actions exactly once per round.  
On your turn:  
- Choose an available action (must use both actions once).  
- Remove the corresponding Action Tile from your Profit Board.  
- Take your leftmost unused marker from the order track.  
- Use it to replace any Company Disc on the market track.  
- Then, use the removed disc to perform the chosen action.  

Available actions:  

**Buy Shares**  
1. Remove "Buy Shares" tile.  
2. Replace any disc on the market track with your order marker.  
3. Place the chosen disc on the "0" space of your Profit Board.  
→ This starts tracking that company’s stock value for you.  

**Build Tracks**  
1. Remove "Build Tracks" tile.  
2. Replace any disc on the market track with your order marker.  
3. Place the chosen disc on an empty map hex adjacent to another disc of the same color.  
   - Cannot place on a hex already occupied.  
   - Must be adjacent to same-color disc (unless first disc of that color, which starts on frame).  
4. Adjust all stocks of that color across all players’ Profit Boards based on the hex type:  
   - White spots: +1 per spot  
   - Red spots: -1 per spot  
   - Example: "Farmland" hex has 2 white spots → all stocks of that color move +2  
5. If no legal hex exists (company is blocked), place the disc on its colored frame:  
   - All stocks of that color move -1 (loss).  
   - Cannot choose this if a legal map placement exists.  

**Turn Order Note**  
- After all actions, the market track (now filled with player markers) becomes the next round’s order track.  
- The current order track (now empty) becomes the next market track.  

**Taxation Phase**  
1. One disc remains on the market track (not chosen by any player).  
2. Move this disc to the leftmost empty space in the Taxed Area of the Market Board.  
3. Shift all player markers on the market track one space left to fill the gap.  
   - This creates the player order for the next round.  
4. Proceed to next round.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Stock Value Tracking**: Each company’s stock value changes based on where tracks are built. All players’ stocks of that color move together.  
- **Turn Order Dynamics**: Turn order shifts each round based on action selection and marker placement. Strategic disc selection affects both stock movement and future turn order.  
- **Forced Build Penalty**: If a company cannot expand, building results in a -1 penalty to all its stocks.  
- **Action Limitation**: Each player must perform "Buy Shares" and "Build Tracks" exactly once per round.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after 6 rounds. All 6 spaces in the Taxed Area are filled.  

Scoring Steps:  
1. For each company **with at least one disc in the Taxed Area**:  
   - Remove all stocks of that color from players’ Profit Boards that are in the **negative zone** (value < 0).  
2. For each company **with no discs in the Taxed Area**:  
   - Remove all stocks of that color from players’ Profit Boards that are in the **positive zone** (value > 0).  
3. Count the total value of remaining stocks on each player’s Profit Board.  
   - Each player should have exactly 6 stocks (one per round of buying).  
4. Highest total profit wins.  

**Tiebreaker**:  
- Compare the highest-valued remaining stock.  
- If still tied, compare the second-highest, and so on.  
- If all compared stocks are equal, players share victory.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you win with all negative stocks?**  
  Yes. The player who lost the least (e.g., -1 vs -5) wins.  
- **What if a stock is at +10 and gains more?**  
  It stays at +10. Stocks cannot exceed +10 or -10.  
- **Can you build on a frame?**  
  Only if no legal map placement exists for that color.  
- **Can you buy shares of a company with no presence on the map?**  
  Yes. Buying shares does not require adjacency.  
- **Can two actions be taken consecutively?**  
  Yes. If your two markers are adjacent on the order track, you may take two turns in a row.
