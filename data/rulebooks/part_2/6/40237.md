## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Long Shot is a horse racing board game where players buy, bet on, and influence the movement of horses during a race. The objective is to have the most money at the end of the game by strategically purchasing horses, placing bets, and using Long Shot cards.

### 2. Components  
- Game board (racetrack with start/finish line and "No Bets" area)  
- 10 plastic horses (in 3 colors)  
- 10 Horse cards (one per horse, showing movement bar, odds, and horse features)  
- 2 dice:  
  - 1 green d6 "Move" die (numbered 0–5)  
  - 1 d10 "Horse" die (numbered 1–10)  
- 70 betting chips  
- 104 "Long Shot" cards  
- 8 "Reroll" tokens (1 per player)  
- Paper money in denominations of $5 and $10  
- Banker’s area for money, betting chips, and draw/discard piles  

### 3. Setup  
- Place all 10 horses behind the starting line.  
- Lay Horse cards face-up in a row next to the board.  
- Stack betting chips and money near the board.  
- Place the Long Shot card deck face-down in the board’s corner; this is the draw pile. A discard pile will form beside it.  
- Each player receives:  
  - $25 (three $5 bills, one $10 bill)  
  - 3 randomly dealt Long Shot cards  
  - 1 "Reroll" token  
- Choose a banker to manage transactions (the banker is also a player).  
- All players roll the Horse die; highest roller goes first. Play proceeds clockwise.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, follow these steps in order:

#### 1. Activate Horse Features  
- Trigger all abilities on horses **you own** that have special “Horse Features” (e.g., bonus actions when leading or moving).  
- These activate automatically at the start of your turn.

#### 2. Roll Dice and Move Horses  
- Roll both dice:  
  - Horse die (d10): determines which horse moves  
  - Move die (d6): determines how many spaces it moves (0–5)  
- **If the rolled horse has already finished the race**, reroll both dice until a horse still in the race is selected.  
- Move the horse shown on the Horse die by the number on the Move die.  
- **If the Move die shows 0**:  
  - The horse does **not** move.  
  - If the rolled horse is **owned**, steal 1 random Long Shot card from its owner.  
  - If the horse is **unowned**, draw 1 card from the draw pile.  
  - No horses (including those with the rolled number in their Movement Bar) move.  

- **Additional Movement for Owned Horses**:  
  - After moving the main horse, you may move **any horses you own** that have the **rolled Horse number** in their **Movement Bar**.  
  - Move each eligible owned horse by the number shown on the Move die.  
  - You may move multiple owned horses this way, if qualified.

- **Reroll Token Use**:  
  - At any point **immediately after rolling**, you may discard your Reroll token to reroll **one die**.  
  - The new roll replaces the original; movement follows the new result.  
  - Once used, the Reroll token is removed from the game.  
  - Cannot use Reroll token and a card that modifies dice on the same roll.

#### 3. Take One Action  
Choose **exactly one** of the following:

- **Play a Long Shot Card**  
  - Play one card from your hand and resolve its effect.  
  - Cards may allow movement, betting, stealing, or other actions.  
  - **Exception**: Cannot bet on or move a horse that has finished the race.  
  - Once ONE horse finishes, cards referencing “lead horse” or “lead space” become invalid and cannot be played.

- **Buy an Unowned Horse**  
  - Pay the amount shown on the top right of the Horse card to the bank.  
  - Take ownership (place one of your colored horses on it).  
  - Horse price reflects number of numbers in its Movement Bar (more = more expensive).

- **Place a $5 Bet**  
  - Bet $5 on any horse **not in the "No Bets" area** and that has **not finished**.  
  - Place $5 in front of you and a betting chip on top (or under, if it’s your own horse).  
  - You may bet on your own horse.  
  - Bets can accumulate over turns (e.g., $5 per turn).  
  - If a horse leaves the "No Bets" area later, betting resumes.

- **Discard 2 Cards for $5**  
  - Discard any 2 cards from your hand (no effect from their text).  
  - Receive $5 from the bank.  
  - Only allowed once per turn.

#### 4. Draw a Card  
- Draw 1 Long Shot card from the draw pile.  
- If the draw pile is empty, skip this step for the rest of the game.

#### 5. Pass the Dice  
- Pass both dice clockwise to the next player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Movement Bar**: Each Horse card has a row of numbers at the bottom. If the Horse die rolls one of those numbers, and you own the horse, you may move it (on your turn only) when that number is rolled.  
- **Ownership**: Only owners can use a horse’s Movement Bar or Horse Feature.  
- **"No Bets" Area**: A section of the track (typically near the end) where new bets are prohibited unless overridden by card text.  
- **Card Priority**: Long Shot card effects override standard rules unless explicitly restricted (e.g., no betting on finished horses).  
- **Finished Horses**:  
  - Cannot be moved, bet on, or affected by any action once they cross the finish line.  
  - Once the **first** horse finishes, “lead horse” mechanics are disabled.  
  - If multiple horses finish simultaneously:  
    - The horse shown on the Horse die moves first.  
    - Then, any horses you own with that number may finish; you choose their order.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Condition**: The game ends **immediately** when the **third horse** crosses the finish line.  
- **Final Steps**:  
  - Discard all remaining Long Shot cards in players’ hands.  
  - Discard all bets on horses that did **not** finish in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. These bets go to the bank.  
  - Place the top 3 horses in the Winner’s Circle in order.

#### Horse Owner Payouts:  
- 1st place: $100  
- 2nd place: $75  
- 3rd place: $50  
- Owners receive these amounts **regardless of bets**.

#### Bet Payouts:  
- Use odds on the Horse card:  
  - **Win (Blue)**: for 1st place  
  - **Place (Red)**: for 2nd place  
  - **Show (White)**: for 3rd place  
- Payout = Bet Amount × Odds  
- Example: $10 bet on a horse that placed (2nd) with 6:1 odds → $60  
- Process one bet at a time: first return original bet to player, then pay winnings from the bank.  
- Bets on horses finishing 4th or worse: lost to the bank.

- **Final Total**: Combine all cash in hand + winnings from ownership + bet payouts.  
- **Winner**: Player with the most money.  
- **Tie**: No tiebreaker. Multiple players may tie for victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I bet on a horse in the "No Bets" area?**  
  Only if a Long Shot card explicitly allows it. Otherwise, no.  
- **Can I bet on a horse that has finished?**  
  No. Never allowed, even with card text.  
- **Can I use Horse Features after a horse finishes?**  
  No. If a feature depends on position (e.g., “while in the lead”), it stops working once any horse finishes.  
- **What if the draw pile runs out?**  
  Players continue without drawing. No further cards are drawn.  
- **Can I save my Reroll token for later?**  
  Yes. It can be used at any point during your turn, but only once.  
- **Do I have to use my Horse Features?**  
  Yes, if conditions are met, they trigger automatically.  
- **Can I pass my action?**  
  Yes. You may choose to take no action during step 3.  
- **Are owned horses worth money at the end?**  
  No. Only cash and bet winnings count. Horses have no resale value.
