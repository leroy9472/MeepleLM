# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Conquest of Paradise is a civilization-building game simulating Polynesian maritime expansion across the central Pacific Ocean. Players explore unknown regions, settle islands, build infrastructure, and expand their island empires to gain Victory Points (VPs). The objective is to be the first to reach the required VP threshold: 28 in a 2-player game, 25 in a 3-player game, or 22 in a 4-player game. Victory is declared during the Victory Step when a player meets the threshold and reveals all Victory Point-bearing Arts & Culture cards.

## 3. Setup
### 3.1 Home Islands by Player Count
- **2 Players**: Tonga and Samoa (both printed on map)
- **3 Players**: Tonga, Samoa, and Hiva (Marquesas Islands). Place Hiva tile in its historic location. Randomly place Open Ocean markers between Niue-Flint Is. and Flint Is.-Hiva.
- **4 Players**: Tonga, Samoa, Hiva, and Raiatea. Set up as 3-player, then add Raiatea tile in its historic location.

### 3.2 Player Setup
Each player:
1. Chooses a color and takes corresponding pieces.
2. Places Home Island Disk on chosen Home Island Group.
3. Places 2 Villages on two green boxes of their Home Island.
4. Places 2 face-down Warrior Bands on their Home Island.
5. Receives 2 Rumors.
6. Places Explorer in stand on their Home Island.

Place Arts & Culture deck face down. Place Discovery Markers in a cup. Set Game End Marker on Victory Point Chart according to player count.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
Each game turn consists of these steps, completed in order:
1. **Turn Order Step** – Determine play order.
2. **Exploration Step** – Move Explorers to discover new hexes.
3. **Movement & Battle Step** – Move units and resolve battles.
4. **Building Step** – Construct new units and developments.
5. **Victory Step** – Tally Victory Points and check for win.

Players perform Turn Order and Building Steps simultaneously. Exploration, Movement & Battle, and Victory Steps are completed in turn order.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### 5.1 Turn Order
- The player in last place on the Victory Point Track takes the Turn Order Marker.
- In case of a tie, priority order is: Tonga, Raiatea, Hiva, Samoa.
- That player decides who goes first and the direction of play (clockwise or counter-clockwise).

### 5.2 Exploration
An Explorer may:
1. **Pre-move**: Move across known, non-enemy hexes to reach an unknown hex.
2. **Discovery**: Enter an unknown hex and draw a Discovery Marker:
   - **Island Group**: Draw a random Island Group Tile, place it face down or face up. Place a Discovered Island Marker on it.
   - **Open Ocean**: Place the marker in the hex, knot side up.
   - **Off Course**: Left neighbor moves Explorer to an adjacent unknown hex; explore that hex instead.
3. **Knots & Return**:
   - 4 or fewer knots: may continue exploring.
   - 5 knots: must return.
   - 6 or more knots: Explorer is Lost (placed in Lost Box).
- Maximum 3 Discovered Island Markers per player.
- Face-down tiles can be revealed by any discovering player at any time.

### 5.3 Movement & Battle
#### Movement
- **Transit**: Before movement, players may freely move units along their Transport Canoe Chain.
- **Movement**: Transport and War Canoes may move 1 or 2 hexes.
- **Canoes**:
  - Transport Canoes carry 1 Warrior Band or 1 Colony.
  - War Canoes carry 1 Warrior Band.
- **Restrictions**:
  - Only War Canoes may enter hexes with enemy units.
  - Transport Canoes may not enter enemy-controlled hexes without a War Canoe escort.
  - War Canoes must stop if they enter a hex with an enemy Controlled Island Group or enemy War Canoe.

#### Battle Resolution
- Occurs when a War Canoe ends movement in a hex with an enemy Controlled Island Group or enemy War Canoe.
- **Setup**:
  - **Front Row**: Warrior Bands on War Canoes, empty War Canoes, and defender's Local Warriors (1 for 1-2 Villages, 2 for 3-4 Villages).
  - **Back Row**: Warrior Bands on Transport Canoes and other non-combat units.
- **Combat**:
  - Attacker rolls a die each round:
    - 1: Attacker removes one Battle Piece.
    - 2-3: Attacker panics one Battle Piece (moves to back row).
    - 4-5: Defender panics one Battle Piece.
    - 6: Defender removes one Battle Piece.
  - Owner chooses which piece is affected when multiple options exist.
  - Battle continues until one side has no Battle Pieces in the front row.
- **Outcome**:
  - Winner retains control of the hex.
  - Loser retreats surviving pieces to nearest friendly Controlled Island Group (requires transport).
- **Saving Villages** (attacker only):
  - May save one enemy Village per surviving front-row Battle Piece (Warrior Band or War Canoe) that is removed.
  - Saved Villages become the attacker's Villages.

### 5.4 Building
- **Build Points (BP)**: One BP per controlled Village.
- **Combined Building**: Villages connected by a Transport Canoe Chain combine BPs. Units may be placed on any Controlled Island Group in the chain.
- **Isolated Building**: Isolated islands use only their own BPs.
- **Building Actions**:
  - **Villages**: 2 BP each. First Village on an island requires a Colony. Only one new Village per island per turn.
  - **Arts & Culture Cards**: 2 BP each. One card per player per turn.
  - **Units**: See cost chart.
- **Turning Inward**: Place Explorer in Lost Box to gain 1 extra BP for use in Home Island or connected islands.

### 5.5 Victory Points
- 1 VP per Village.
- 1 VP per Controlled Island Group connected to Home Island by a Transport Canoe Chain.
- ½ VP per Atoll connected to Home Island by a Transport Canoe Chain.
- VPs from Arts & Culture Cards (revealed only).
- 2 VPs for Kumara Marker (Advanced Rule).
- VPs are not cumulative; current total is tracked each turn.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- Game ends during the first Victory Step where a player reaches the required VP threshold.
- To declare victory, the player must reveal all Victory Point-bearing Arts & Culture cards.
- If a recount shows insufficient VPs or if another player reveals Deforestation, the game continues.
- If multiple players meet the threshold, the winner is determined by:
  1. Highest VP total.
  2. Most Controlled Island Groups (tiebreaker).
  3. Most Arts & Culture Cards (final tiebreaker).

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Face-down tiles**: Must be flipped face-up to move through during Pre-move.
- **Retreating with no transport**: Warrior Bands and Colonies without transport are removed.
- **Battle winner's panicked units**: Return to the battle hex; they do not retreat.
- **Back-row warriors**: Cannot be used to save villages after conquest.
- **No retreat location**: Units retreat to nearest friendly island, even if under attack.
- **Building on secret islands**: Must flip tile face-up before building.
- **Island Group connection**: Required for 1 VP bonus, not for Village VPs.
- **Atolls with improvements**: "Volcanic Ash" or "Discovered Spring" turn an Atoll into a full Island Group worth 1 VP for the group and 1 VP per Village.
- **Severe Erosion on 1-Village island**: Destroys the island's capacity; it becomes worthless (not even an Atoll).
- **Random Events**: Begin after first player reaches 5+ VPs. Last-place player chooses between drawing event or setting turn order.
