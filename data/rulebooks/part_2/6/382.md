## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Top Secret Spies*, players are secret service chiefs competing to uncover classified intelligence by moving their agents through a city to access a safe that contains vital information. The safe moves frequently, and only when an agent arrives at the building where the safe is located does a "scoring situation" occur, allowing agents to gain or lose intelligence points based on their location. The goal is to advance your agent’s scoring marker the farthest on the scoring track by cleverly moving agents—your own and others—while keeping your agent’s identity hidden.

The player whose agent’s scoring marker reaches or passes the finish space (and ultimately moves the farthest) wins. In variants, players may also earn bonus points by correctly deducing opponents’ agent identities.

### 2. Components  
- 7 agent figures (red, blue, green, yellow, violet, orange, gray)  
- 7 scoring markers (one per agent color)  
- 7 agent cards (matching agent colors)  
- 1 game board featuring numbered buildings (including Church [0], Ruins [–3], and buildings 1–10)  
- 1 safe  
- 1 six-sided die (with faces: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and “1-3”)  
- 26 Top Secret cards (used only in the Top Secret and Secret Dossier variants)  

### 3. Setup – Basic Game  
- **Determine number of agents to use:**  
  - 2 players: 5 agents  
  - 3 players: 6 agents  
  - 4+ players: all 7 agents  
- Return unused agents, scoring markers, and agent cards to the box.  
- Place the board in the center.  
- Place all active agent figures in the Church (building 0).  
- Place all scoring markers on the Start/Finish space (space 0) of the scoring track.  
- Place the safe on building 7.  
- Place the die in the center of the board.  
- Shuffle the used agent cards and deal one face-down to each player. Players secretly view and keep their agent card hidden.  
- Unused agent cards (free agents) are placed face-down beneath the board.  
- **Note:** With 7 players, all agents are assigned—no free agents.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise, starting with the oldest. On a turn, a player:

1. **Rolls the die** to determine movement points.  
2. **Moves at least one agent** using all movement points.  
3. **Checks for a scoring situation** (only if an agent is moved *to* the building with the safe).  
   - a. Move scoring markers based on agents’ building numbers.  
   - b. Move the safe to any building.  
4. **Passes the die** to the left neighbor.

Turns continue until one or more scoring markers reach or pass the finish space.

#### 1. Roll the Die  
- Die results:  
  - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 → that many movement points  
  - “1-3” → choose 1, 2, or 3 movement points  

#### 2. Move Agents  
- Player must move at least one agent.  
- May move any agent(s), including opponents’ or free agents.  
- Movement is always **clockwise** from building to building.  
- Each building moved = 1 movement point.  
- Multiple agents may occupy the same building.  
- All movement points must be used; none can be saved.  

**Example:** Rolling a 6 allows:  
- One agent moved 6 spaces  
- Six agents moved 1 space each  
- Any combination totaling 6 points  

#### 3. Scoring Situation  
A scoring situation occurs **only** when one or more agents are **moved to** the building where the safe is located.  
- Moving *through* the safe’s building does **not** trigger scoring.  

##### 3.a. Move Scoring Markers  
Each agent’s scoring marker is moved based on the **number of the building** they are in when scoring occurs:  
- Buildings 1–10: move forward that many spaces  
- Church (0): no movement  
- Ruins (–3): move backward 3 spaces (but not past Start/Finish)  

**The active player moves all scoring markers.**  

##### 3.b. Move the Safe  
After scoring, the active player moves the safe to **any building** (including Church or Ruins).  
- Placing the safe on a building with agents does **not** trigger scoring.  
- Scoring only occurs when an agent is **moved to** the safe.  

#### 4. Pass the Die  
After all actions, the player passes the die to the left. Turn ends.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Hidden Identity:** Each player’s agent is secret. Only the owner knows which agent they control.  
- **Bluffing & Misdirection:** Players move all agents, making it hard for others to deduce identities.  
- **Free Agents:** Unused agents are neutral; players move them but gain no points unless they control them via variant rules.  
- **Scoring Trigger:** Only agent movement *to* the safe’s location causes scoring. Safe movement alone does not.  
- **Backward Movement:** Ruins (–3) cause loss of 3 points during scoring.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends **immediately after a turn** in which **one or more scoring markers reach or pass the finish space**.  
- All players reveal their agent cards.  
- Free agent cards are revealed.  
- **Winner:** The player whose agent’s scoring marker has advanced the **farthest** on the track.  
  - If multiple agents reach/past finish, the one farthest ahead wins.  
  - If a **free agent** wins, players may choose to replay.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move only other agents and not my own?** Yes. You may choose not to move your agent.  
- **Can I skip moving if I roll “1-3”?** In the **basic game**, no—you must move at least one agent. In the **Top Secret Variant**, yes.  
- **Does moving the safe to an agent cause scoring?** No. Only moving an agent to the safe causes scoring.  
- **Can multiple agents score in one turn?** Yes—any agent in the safe’s building when a scoring situation is triggered scores.  
- **Can a scoring situation be canceled?** In the **Top Secret Variant**, yes—via card play. In the **basic game**, no.  
- **Can scoring markers go past space 40?** Yes, unless restricted by a Top Secret card.
