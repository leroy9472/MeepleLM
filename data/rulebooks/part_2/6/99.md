# Fortress America — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In a future where the U.S. has deployed solar-powered satellites with hidden anti-missile lasers, global powers—angered by perceived dominance—form three invading coalitions: the Asian Peoples Alliance (West), Central American Federation (South), and Euro-Socialist Pact (East). The U.S., undermanned and unprepared, must defend itself.

**Victory Conditions:**
- **U.S.A. Victory:** Achieved if:
  - All invader units are destroyed, **or**
  - Invaders mutually concede due to overwhelming U.S. strength.
  - *Additional requirement:* The U.S.A. must control at least 13 of its original 30 City territories at the end of each of its turns.
- **Invader Victory:** Achieved if, at the end of any U.S.A. player turn, invaders collectively control **18 City territories**.
  - After this, invaders take one final round of turns to determine individual victory.
- **Individual Invader Victory:** After the final invader round:
  - 10 points per City territory
  - 3 points per Resource territory (oil, mineral, agricultural)
  - 5 points per destroyed U.S.A. laser
  - Highest total wins.

4. **Fire Lasers** (U.S.A. only)
5. **Combat**
6. **Second Movement**

### 5. Core Mechanics
#### Reinforcements
- **Invaders:** On turns 2–6, add 8 new units to invasion zones (max 5 per zone). No reinforcements after turn 6.
- **U.S.A.:**
  1. Place 1 laser in any U.S.A.-controlled City territory (max 1 laser per city).
  2. Draw 2 Partisan cards and resolve immediately.
  3. Bonus: For each City territory recaptured on previous turn, draw 1 extra Partisan card (draw after the 2 regular cards).

#### Partisan Cards
- Used only by U.S.A. player.
- Effects vary: place Partisans, redeploy destroyed units, destroy/retreat invader units, special movements.
- Cards may specify:
  - Sectors (West, Rocky Mountains, South, Plains, East)
  - Resource types (oil, mineral, agricultural)
  - Specific territories
- **Placement Rules:**
  - Can place in friendly or unoccupied enemy-controlled (non-city) territories.
  - Cannot place in cities (except via MAJOR AIRLIFT! card), enemy-occupied, or invasion zones.
  - "Place separately where possible" means spread units if feasible.
- Unplayable cards are discarded.

#### Declare Battles
- Declare attacks by placing BATTLE markers.
- **Invaders:** Place BATTLE marker in target territory.
- **U.S.A.:** Flip invader’s CONTROL marker to BATTLE side, or use invader’s marker in invasion zone.
- Units must be in combat position (adjacent or moving into adjacency during First Movement).
- Bombers and helicopters have special combat positions (see below).

#### First Movement
- **Foot Units (Infantry, Partisans):** Cannot move.
- **Mechanized (Hovertanks, Mobiles):** Move 1 adjacent friendly territory.
- **Helicopters:** Move up to 2 spaces. Can land in unoccupied enemy-controlled (non-city) territories if declared for battle. If they do, they cannot attack or move in Second Movement.
- **Bombers:** Move up to 4 spaces. Can enter enemy-occupied territory to bomb (place bomber in territory). Up to 5 bombers can attack one territory.
- **Five-Unit Limit:** Max 5 units per space at end of action (bombers in combat exempt).

#### Fire Lasers (U.S.A. only)
- After placing new laser, fire all lasers on board (including new one).
- For each laser:
  1. Choose target territory or invasion zone.
  2. Declare target unit.
  3. Roll one blue 10-sided die:
     - **5–10:** Destroy unit.
     - **1–4:** Miss.
  4. Place a laser fire marker in target space (cannot fire another laser there this turn).
- After all lasers fired, remove fire markers.

#### Combat
- **Combat Sequence:**
  1. **Defender fires first** (by unit class: Air → Mechanized → Foot).
  2. **Attacker fires last** (same order).
- **Dice by Unit:**
  - Infantry, Mobile: red 6-sided
  - Hovertank, Helicopter: white 8-sided
  - Bomber: blue 10-sided
  - Partisan: 6-sided (with others), 8-sided (alone)
- **Combat Results Table:**
  - **Column 1:** Used when attacking City or Mountain without combined arms (requires 6+ to destroy).
  - **Column 2:** Default (requires 5+ to destroy).
- **Combined Arms:** Attacking with at least one foot, one mechanized, and one air unit. Required for Column 2 in City/Mountain attacks.
- **Casualties:**
  - **Target Destroyed:** Remove unit.
  - **Attacker Disengaged (defender rolls 1):** Flip unit upside-down; cannot attack or move in Second Movement.
  - **Defender Retreated (attacker rolls 1):** Move defender to adjacent friendly space (per movement rules). If cannot, destroy unit.

#### Second Movement
- **Foot Units:** Move 1 adjacent space.
- **Mechanized & Air:** Same as First Movement.
- **Bombers that attacked alone:** Must move 1–4 spaces to friendly space.
- **Entering Vacant Territories:**
  - Can move into vacant (enemy-defeated) territories.
  - To capture, must move at least one unit in.
  - Cannot move into territory vacated by lone bomber(s).
- **Destroying Lasers:** If invader moves into vacant City territory with a laser, remove and claim it (worth 5 VP).

#### Supply Check (Invaders only)
- After Second Movement, check if any units are **isolated** (no path via friendly/unoccupied controlled territories to any invasion zone).
- Isolated units are **destroyed** and given to U.S.A. player.

#### Capture Territories
- **Invaders:**
  - If unit occupies a vacant declared territory, flip BATTLE marker to CONTROL side.
  - If no unit present, remove BATTLE marker (no capture).
- **U.S.A.:**
  - If unit occupies a vacant declared territory, remove invader’s BATTLE marker (recapture).
  - For each City recaptured, draw 1 bonus Partisan card (used next turn).
  - Flip disengaged units right-side-up.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can invaders attack each other?** Yes. They are enemies to each other. Can declare battle, fight, and capture territories.
- **What if Partisan card cannot be fully executed?** Do as much as possible. If impossible, discard.
- **Can helicopters transport units?** Not in base rules.
- **Can bombers attack from adjacent space only?** No—bombers can enter enemy territory to attack.
- **Can U.S.A. units be placed in enemy cities?** Only via MAJOR AIRLIFT! card.
- **Are lakes traversable?** No. Not game spaces.
- **Adjacent territories?** Share a border, not just a corner.
- **Destroyed units:** Invader units are permanently removed. U.S.A. units go to tray and can be redeployed via Partisan cards.
