### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Stock Rounds (SR):** Players take turns performing actions in player order until all pass consecutively
   - Sell shares
   - Repay loans
   - Buy shares, convert concessions, or place bids
2. **End of SR:** Resolve bids, float companies, determine next player order
3. **Operating Rounds (OR):** Companies operate in descending share price order
   - Private companies and concessions pay dividends
   - Minor companies operate
   - Major companies operate
4. **Phase Progression:** Game advances through phases as new train types are purchased
5. **Game End:** Triggered when stock market reaches end-game value, bank runs out of money, or no items sell in SR

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Bidding System:**
- Three bidding tracks: concessions (3 boxes), minors (4 boxes), privates (3 boxes)
- Players have limited bidding tokens (9 - number of players)
- Can place/move up to 3 bids per turn
- Opening bid must be ≥ face value (£100 for concessions, £0 for others)
- Bids must be in £5 increments
- Highest bidder wins item at bid price

**Stock Market:**
- Share prices move based on sales and dividend payments
- Sales: Price drops one space per share sold
- Dividends: 
  - £0 dividend: price moves left one space
  - Dividend ≥ share price: moves right one space
  - Dividend ≥ 2× share price: moves right two spaces
- Companies with 100% shares sold move up one space at end of SR

**Company Operations:**
*Minor Companies:*
- Must own a train
- Lay one yellow tile or upgrade to green per OR
- Earnings split 50/50 between company and director
- Can acquire green-background private companies

*Major Companies:*
- Must own a train
- Track laying:
  - Phase 2: One yellow tile
  - Phase 3+: Two yellow tiles or one upgrade
- Earnings: withhold all, pay all, or split 50/50
- Can acquire any private company (except P16)

**Train System:**
- Phases advance when first train of new type is bought:
  - Phase 2: First 2-train or L→2 conversion
  - Phase 3: First 3-train
  - Phase 4: First 4-train
  - Phase 5: First 5-train
  - Phase 6: First 6-train
  - Phase 7: First 7/E-train
- Rusting: Previous train types removed when new phase starts
- Train limits:
  - Minors: Phase 1-3: 2 trains; Phase 4+: 1 train
  - Majors: Phase 2: 4; Phase 4: 3; Phase 5+: 2

**Private Companies:**
- P1: Permanent 5-train

**Minor Company Acquisition:**
- Major companies can acquire one minor per OR

  - Directors must agree
- Payment: Minor's value (2 × share price) in cash and/or major's shares
- Acquirer gains minor's cash, trains, and private companies

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Game End Triggers:**
- First SR ends with nothing sold
- Company stock reaches "game end" value during OR (ends after current ORs)
- Company stock reaches "game end" value during SR (ends after next ORs)
- Bank runs out of money during OR (ends after current ORs)
- Bank runs out of money during SR (ends after next ORs)

**Final Scoring:**
- Player wealth = Cash on hand + Value of stock at current prices - Outstanding loans
- Concession certificates count for face value (£100) if still held
- Private companies and company assets count for nothing
- Highest wealth wins

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
**Bidding Box 1 Unsold:**
- Minor removed from game
- Next available train from bank exported (can trigger phase change)

**Unsold Minors:**
- Each unsold minor exports one L/2-train from bank
- Can trigger phase change if last L/2-train exported

**Emergency Train Purchase:**
- Company without train must buy one
- Must buy cheapest available train from bank/bank pool
- Director contributes cash if needed
- If still insufficient, director sells shares (keeping director's certificate)
- If still insufficient, takes loan (150% of shortfall due to 50% interest)

**Certificate Limit:**
- Varies by player count
- Items with highest bid count against limit
- Cannot buy shares that would exceed limit
- Must sell down if over limit

**Special Trains:**
- 2P and LP trains: Permanent, don't count against train limit, don't satisfy train requirement
- Pullman cars: Convert normal train to + train (can include unlimited towns), don't count against limit

**London Rules:**
- Six stations plus rondel station (seven total)
- Company can have multiple tokens but not on same exit
- Upgrading costs £20 per level
- Cannot run between London stations
- M14 can place token on rondel for £20 (counts as track lay)

**English Channel:**
- Upgrades cost £100 each
- SECR can place token there for free
- E-trains stop at owning company's token
- Regular trains use Dover/Folkestone connections
