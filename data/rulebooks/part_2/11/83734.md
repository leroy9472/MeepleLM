## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
Strike of the Eagle is a strategic wargame simulating military operations during a historical conflict between Polish and Soviet forces, with optional Lithuanian involvement. The objective is to gain Victory Points (VPs) through battlefield victories, control of key cities, elimination of enemy out-of-supply units, and successful retreats or defenses. The player with the most VPs at the end of the scenario wins.

2. **Components**  
- Block units (Polish and Soviet forces), differentiated by color and type:  
  - Black squares: Infantry  
  - White squares: Cavalry  
  - Green squares: Allied infantry  
  - (D): Division, (B): Brigade  
- Strength Points (SP): Represented by visible squares; blocks rotate clockwise as they take damage.  
- Cards: Used for Reinforcements, Additional Orders, or Historical Events.  
- Tokens: Spent/Fatigue tokens (e.g., yellow for Forced March, brown for general orders), Out-of-Supply markers.  
- Turn Track: Tracks Operation Phases (1–5) and Reinforcement Phase.  
- Force Pool: Holds unused blocks and eliminated units (unless permanently removed).  
- Screens: One per team to conceal card and order choices.  
- Victory Point (VP) tracker.

3. **Setup**  
- Place starting blocks and garrisons per scenario instructions.  
- New blocks arriving in future Operation Phases are pre-placed on the corresponding turn track slot.  
- Unused blocks are placed in the Force Pool.  
- Use screens to hide orders and card plays.  
- Optional: Use Leaders as 1SP cavalry if Leader effects are disabled.  
- Polish and Soviet players share the order pool in 3–4 player games.  
- Lithuania is off-limits to both sides until Soviet card #23 ("Alliance with Lithuania") is played. Upon playing it, place a friendly garrison at Kaunas.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
Each round consists of:  
1. Replenish Cards Phase  
2. Operation Phases (1–5)  
3. Reinforcement Phase  

Repeat until the scenario ends.

**Replenish Cards Phase**  
- Draw 6 new cards; discard down to 7.  
- In 2-player multi-front scenarios: Draw 2 additional cards in Operation Phases 2 and 4 (still discard down to 7).

**Operation Phase (1 of 5, repeated)**  
1. **Place New Blocks**  
   - Place blocks from the turn track onto the map per scenario instructions.

2. **Play a Card**  
   - Each player selects a card face down (revealed simultaneously).  
   - Options:  
     - **Reinforcements**: Collect cubes as shown (black, white, green).  
     - **Additional Orders**: Gain orders equal to blue digit (top-left).  
     - **Historical Event**: If applicable to front, execute and remove card.  
   - Non-initiative player decides first on each front.

3. **Place Orders (Face Down, Alternating)**  
   - Default: 2 orders per front (must include 1 Recon per front).  
   - Additional orders from card play increase limit.  
   - Initiative player decides who places first.  
   - Only one order per area.  
   - Order types:  
     - Forced March To/Out  
     - Recon  
     - Move To/Out  
     - Withdraw  
     - Defend Area  
     - Reorganisation  
     - Rail Transport (only order allowed in area)  
   - Must be placeable (at least one block can carry it out).  
   - If unexecutable when called, removed without penalty.

4. **Execute Orders (Northern Front First, then Southern)**  
   - Initiative player decides order of execution within each step.

   a. **Forced March Orders**  
      - Units must be in supply.  
      - Infantry: Move up to 2 areas.  
      - Cavalry & Leaders: Move up to 3 areas.  
      - Along roads or rails.  
      - Enemy units in departure area pin equal number of friendly units.  
      - Brigades may detach from divisions if available in force pool (new brigades cannot move).  
      - Units entering battle fight at ½ SP (rounded down); mark with Spent(Forced March) token.

   b. **Recon Orders**  
      - Area must be within 3 areas of a friendly block (not Soviet Reinforcement boxes).  
      - Reveal all enemy blocks in area; conceal after.

   c. **Move Orders**  
      - Move To: Units must be in supply.  
      - Move Out: Units may be out of supply.  
      - Infantry: 1 area.  
      - Cavalry & Leaders: Up to 2 areas.  
      - Enemy units in departure area pin equal number.  
      - Brigades may detach (same rules as Forced March).  
      - Mark moved blocks with Spent(March) token.

   d. **Withdraw Orders**  
      - If area attacked, all friendly units must withdraw one area toward nearest supply depot.  
      - One block loses 1SP immediately.  
      - Exception: Ignored if all withdrawing units are cavalry and attackers are all infantry.  
      - If unable to retreat, units stay and fight (still suffer 1SP loss).

5. **Fight Battles**  
   - Resolve by smallest battle size; initiative player chooses order if tied.  
   - Northern Front before Southern Front.

   a. **Declare Cards**  
      - Attacker declares first:  
        - Battle Card / Event  
        - Combat Modifier Card (from hand or deck)  
      - Defender responds.  
      - Cards placed face down; revealed simultaneously.  
      - Modifier: Red number (+1 if from hand).

   b. **Reveal Orders**  
      - Reveal **Defend Area** order: Negates one flanking penalty; causes -1 SP loss to defender.  
      - Reveal **Reorganisation** order: Assign to one block. That block fights at ½ SP (rounded down). Order still executes later if block wins.

   c. **Calculate Combat Strength (SP)**  
      - (Sum of unit SPs) + (1SP if garrisoned) + (Combat Modifier)  
      - -2 SP per flank attack (attack via route other than primary).  
      - Each flank penalty may be negated by:  
        - All attack routes cross fortified sectors  
        - Defend Area order present  
        - One per supporting force (units entering via separate route)  
      - Units with Spent(Forced March) or Reorganisation token fight at ½ SP.

   d. **Calculate SP Losses**  
      - Defender loses -1 SP if:  
        - Fortifications present and all attack routes cross them  
        - Defend Area order present  
      - Modified by Battle/Reaction Cards.

   e. **Assign Losses**  
      - Garrison takes first loss (removed from city).  
      - Subsequent losses to strongest unit.  
      - Eliminated blocks go to Force Pool (unless out of supply or cannot retreat).  
      - Leader eliminated: Permanently removed, opponent gains +1VP (if in combat) or +2VP (if out of supply or failed retreat).

   f. **Determine Victor**  
      - Side inflicting more SP losses wins.  
      - Tie: Defender wins.  
      - Victor gains +1VP if 4 or more actual SP losses inflicted.

   g. **Adjust Initiative**  
      - -1 if initiative player loses battle.  
      - +1 if initiative player wins and inflicts SP losses > current initiative value.  
      - Initiative change capped at ±1 per battle.

   h. **Retreat Losing Side**  
      - All defeated units retreat together if possible.  
      - One area toward nearest friendly supply depot.  
      - May use next nearest if path blocked.  
      - Cannot retreat into enemy-occupied area.  
      - Cannot retreat via attacker’s entry route.  
      - Cannot overstack during retreat.  
      - Excess units retreat toward next nearest depot.  
      - Blocks that cannot retreat: Permanently removed; +1VP per block (Leaders: +2VP).  
      - Mark retreated blocks with Spent(Retreat) token.

   i. **Victor Occupation**  
      - Must leave at least one block in battle area.  
      - Others may return to entry area(s), avoiding overstack.

6. **Execute Remaining Orders**  
   a. **Reorganisation Orders**  
      - Must be in supply and not have moved.  
      - Assign to one block; add 1 SP.  
      - Block marked with Spent(Reorganize) token.

   b. **Rail Transport Orders**  
      - Up to 4 blocks from one area.  
      - Each may move up to 8 areas by rail.  
      - Must be in supply at start and end.  
      - Cannot have executed any order or fought this phase.  
      - May disperse to different areas.  
      - Cannot enter enemy-occupied areas.

7. **Check Supply**  
   - Supply Depot: Friendly, in-supply Key City (bannered) with supply line to:  
     - Warsaw (Polish)  
     - Soviet Eastern Link (Soviet)  
   - Unit in supply if:  
     - Infantry: ≤3 areas from depot  
     - Cavalry: ≤5 areas from depot  
     - Leaders: Always in supply  
   - Out-of-Supply (OOS) Effects:  
     - Immediately lose 1 SP.  
     - +1VP to opponent per eliminated OOS block (permanently removed).  
     - OOS garrisons removed immediately.  
     - OOS units may only Move Out, Withdraw, or Defend.

8. **Score Victory Points**  
   - Award immediately:  
     - Control of key cities  
     - Scenario-specific objectives  
     - Eliminated OOS units  
     - Failed retreats  
     - Great Victories (4+ SP losses inflicted)

9. **Reinforcement Phase**  
   a. **Replace Garrisons**  
      - Occupied, in-supply key cities gain a friendly garrison (if none present).

   b. **Combine Blocks**  
      - Brigades and reduced divisions may combine into existing reduced divisions.  
      - Conserve total SP; return excess to force pool.

   c. **Strengthen/Build New Blocks**  
      - Collect cubes for controlling strategic cities (must be spent this phase, on same front, in city if building).  
      - Kaunas cubes only available after card #23.  
      - Other cubes may be saved.  

      - **Strengthen**:  
        - 2 cubes (any color) → +1 SP to in-supply block  
        - Front-line areas (adjacent to enemy): Max +1 SP total per area  

      - **Build New Blocks**:  
        - 1 cube → 1SP Brigade (infantry or cavalry)  
        - 2 cubes → 1SP Division (infantry or cavalry)  
        - 1 green cube → 1SP Allied Infantry Division  
        - Placed in friendly supply depot (or strategic city if from city’s cube)  
        - Cannot be strengthened in build turn  

5. **Core Mechanics**  
- **Stacking Limit**: 4 blocks per area (garrisons do not count).  
- **Order Execution**: One order per block per phase.  
- **Spent Tokens**: Prevent reuse of blocks in multiple orders.  
- **Initiative**: Determines execution order; adjusts after battles.  
- **Simultaneous Reveal**: Cards and orders revealed at key stages.  
- **Supply Rules**: Critical for movement, combat effectiveness, and survival.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
- VPs awarded immediately for:  
  - Eliminating OOS units (+1VP/block, +2VP for leaders)  
  - Failed retreats (+1VP/block, +2VP for leaders)  
  - Great Victories (+1VP for inflicting 4+ SP losses)  
  - Controlling key cities (per scenario)  
  - Scenario-specific objectives  
- Game ends when scenario conditions are met.  
- Player with most VPs wins.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
- **Can two orders of different types be placed in the same area?**  
  No. Only one order per area, regardless of type.

- **What happens if a Forced March cannot be completed?**  
  The order is removed without penalty; no partial movement.

- **Can a block execute more than one order per phase?**  
  No. A block may only execute one order per Operation Phase.

- **Do garrisons count toward stacking limit?**  
  No. Garrisons are not counted in the 4-block stacking limit.

- **Can a block use Rail Transport after Reorganisation?**  
  No. A block that executed Reorganisation is spent and cannot Rail Transport.

- **Can a block that retreated still reorganize?**  
  No. Retreated blocks have Spent(Retreat) token and cannot execute Reorganisation.

- **Can a block in an embattled area receive reinforcements?**  
  Yes, if total blocks after reinforcement ≤4.

- **Can a block move through an embattled area?**  
  No. Blocks may not pass through embattled areas.

- **What if a leader is eliminated?**  
  Permanently removed; opponent gains +2VP.

- **When are VPs awarded for OOS units?**  
  Immediately upon elimination during supply check.
