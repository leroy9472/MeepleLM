## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Inhabit the Earth is a strategic race game where players evolve and guide wildlife across six continents. The goal is to score the most points by the end of the game through creature placement, abilities, and collected tokens. The game ends immediately when two continent trails are completed (i.e., two finishing spaces are occupied). The player with the highest total score wins.

### 2. Components  
- **6 Continent Boards**: Africa (brown), Asia (red), Australasia (yellow), Europe (green), North America (purple), South America (light blue). Each board features a trail divided into three regions (1 to 3, south to north), terrain types, and token spaces.  
- **162 Creature Cards**: Divided into three decks (Deck 1, 2, 3) based on region number (first digit of reference number). Cards show:
  - Creature name, class (Predator, Herbivore, Bird, Smaller Mammal, Primate, Reptile), continent, terrain.
  - Special ability (square icon) in Decks 1–2.
  - Scoring ability (round icon) in Decks 2–3; black background in Deck 3 indicates vulnerability to opponents.
- **24 Wooden Creature Counters**: 6 each in blue, green, red, yellow. One side white (breedable), one black (bred). Footprint stickers (by class) are affixed to both sides.
- **58 Tokens**: 
  - 26 green (hedgehog/bobcat)
  - 26 blue (robin/swift)
  - 6 red (3-point finish tokens)
- **24 Black Wooden Movement Markers**: Track used icons during movement.
- **24 Coloured Wooden Trigger Cube Markers**: 6 each in player colours; mark triggered creatures.
- **30 Transparent Yellow Sun Markers**: Track which continent a creature’s counter is in.
- **4 Token Racks**
- **4 Turn Option Summary Cards**: One per player colour, listing the three actions.
- **Sticker Sheet**: Footprints for each creature class.

### 3. Setup  
**Full Game Setup**:
1. Place all six continent boards in the center, arranged geographically if desired.
2. On each board:
   - Place a green token face down on each black-bordered token space.
   - Stack a blue token on top of each green token.
   - Place a red token face down on each red-bordered token space.
3. Sort cards into three decks (1, 2, 3) by number on the back.
4. Deal one red-numbered predator card (#111–#116) to each player. Shuffle remaining Deck 1 cards and deal 5 more to each player (6 total).
5. Shuffle Decks 2 and 3 separately; place as draw piles.
6. Each player takes:
   - 6 counters (one per class)
   - Token rack
   - Turn summary card
   - 6 sun markers
7. If fewer than 4 players, place sun markers on the first unused spaces of each trail to block them.

**Introductory Game Setup (for 2–3 players)**:
- Use only Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe boards (reverse side with egg symbol).
- Do not use green bobcat or blue swift tokens.
- Each player is dealt one of three starting hands:
  - Green: #111, #121, #131, #141
  - Red: #112, #122, #132, #142
  - Blue: #113, #123, #133, #143
- Hand limit: 4 cards.
- Only 4 creature classes: Predators, Herbivores, Birds, Smaller Mammals.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, choose **one** of three actions:

#### 1. MENAGERIE (Add cards to menagerie)  
Perform any number of these sub-actions in any order. Discard one card per action unless a special ability waives this.  
- **a. Introduce**: Add a new class of creature.  
  - Place card in menagerie.  
  - Place counter on the continent shown on the card, in the first available space (based on player count).  
  - Place sun marker on card to track continent.  
- **b. Multiply**: Add a card of the same class *under* an existing creature.  
  - Increases number of that creature type.  
  - Exposes new continent/terrain icons for movement.  
- **c. Evolve**: Replace a creature with another of the same class by placing new card *on top*.  
  - Changes creature type and ability.  
  - Increases count of new type by one.  
- **d. Adapt**: Add a card (usually different class) *under* an existing creature, upside down.  
  - Only continent/terrain icons are visible (class icon hidden).  
  - Does not increase creature count.  
  - Adds movement flexibility.

**Menagerie Rules**:
- Max 6 cards per creature (4 in intro game).
- Cannot have more cards of one class than number of different classes in menagerie.
- Top card determines creature type and ability.
- Supporting cards cannot become top cards; their abilities are inactive.

#### 2. BREED (Draw cards)  
- Discard any hand cards (optional).
- Flip one counter from white to black side.
- Draw cards = (number of that creature in menagerie) + (region number where counter is located).
- Draw from any deck where *any* player has reached that region.
- Reshuffle discard pile if deck is exhausted; if no discards, draw from adjacent deck.
- Hand limit: 6 (4 in intro game).

**Exception**: If all counters are black, breed any one creature for 1 card only (counter stays black).

#### 3. MOVEMENT (Move counters)  
- Play one card or token as **trigger** (discard it).
- From left to right, each menagerie creature with a matching icon (class, continent, terrain) on the trigger is **triggered**.
- Use trigger cubes to mark triggered creatures.
- Move triggered creatures left to right:
  - **b. Move**: Advance counter along trail.  
    - Use one icon (terrain or continent) to move one space forward.  
    - Continue as long as unused matching icons remain.  
    - Move over occupied spaces; cannot stop there.
  - **c. Migrate**: Move counter to another continent.  
    - Can only migrate once per turn, and only as first or last move.  
    - Target continent must be on creature’s card or supporting cards.  
    - Place counter in first unoccupied space of the *same region* in new continent.
  - **d. Flip**: Flip counter from black to white side (enables future breeding).
  - **e. Collect Token**: Take top token when passing over token space.  
    - Spaces 1–3: Blue token on green; take blue first, then green.  
    - Space 4: Red token (3 points); only one counter can reach it.
- Tokens collected go to token rack.
- Tokens can be used:
  - To trigger movement (discard after use).
  - To add to a menagerie card (permanently; boosts movement).
- Red tokens cannot trigger movement.

**Movement Notes**:
- A triggered creature always moves at least one space (continent match ensures this).
- Use black movement markers to track used icons.
- Movement is optional; can skip moving a triggered creature.
- After movement, remove trigger cubes and movement markers.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Menagerie Structure**: One creature per class (6 max). Cards stacked under top card support it. Only top card’s ability counts.
- **Breeding**: Flipping counter enables card draw. Movement resets counter to white.
- **Triggering Movement**: Based on icon match between trigger and creature + supports + tokens.
- **Migration**: Enables cross-continent movement. Requires continent icon. Limited to once per turn and edge of move sequence.
- **Token Use**: Strategic choice between using for movement/activation or saving for endgame points.
- **Hand Management**: Discard before drawing in Breed action. Cannot exceed hand limit.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Game End**:  
- Ends immediately when two different continent finishing spaces are occupied.  
- The player who places the second counter does **not** complete their turn.

**Scoring**:
1. **Counters**: 1 point per region (Region 1 = 1 pt, Region 2 = 2 pts, Region 3 = 3 pts).
2. **Unused Tokens**: Score points printed on token (0–3).
3. **Scoring Cards**: Evaluate round-icon cards on top of each class. Apply scoring ability if visible.

**Tiebreaker**:  
- Compare position of counters: player with counter closest to finish (or at finish) wins.  
- If tied, compare second closest, etc.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use a creature’s ability to introduce itself?**  
  No. The ability must be active *before* the action. Since the creature isn’t in the menagerie yet, its ability cannot be used. (e.g., Lion #111 cannot use its own ability to avoid discard when introducing).
- **Can I adapt with a card of the same class?**  
  Yes, but it does not increase creature count. Usually better to multiply.
- **Can a token added during movement trigger a creature that hasn’t moved yet?**  
  Yes, if the token matches the trigger and the creature is to the right of already-moved creatures.
- **Can I migrate and then move further?**  
  Only if migration is the last move. If migration is first, no further movement.
- **What if I have three counters in one continent at end of turn?**  
  Must correct on next movement action. If unresolved at game end, remove one counter and its cards (no scoring).
- **Can I use a red token to trigger movement?**  
  No. Red tokens are only for point scoring.
- **Can I flip a counter without moving it?**  
  Yes, if it was triggered but you chose not to move it. Cannot flip if it didn’t move or wasn’t triggered.
