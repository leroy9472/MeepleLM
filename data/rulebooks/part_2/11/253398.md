3. Divide the **gold supply evenly** among all players.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order. On a turn, a player must choose **one** of the following actions:

#### 1. Uncover  
- Reveal the top card from the draw pile.  
- Add it to the shared display area.  

#### 2. Auction  
- The player initiates an auction by placing a bid of **at least 1 gold**.  
- Proceeding clockwise, each player may either:  
  - Bid higher than the current highest bid, or  
  - Pass (and exit the auction).  
- Once all players but one have passed, the **highest bidder wins**.  
- The winner:  
  - Takes **any number of cards** from the display.  
  - Places their bid amount into the **gold supply** (removing it from their personal stock).  
  - May **remove one card from the game entirely** (effect permanent).  
  - Then uncovers the next card from the draw pile (i.e., performs an Uncover action).  
- The next round begins with the player to the **right of the auction winner**.

> *Note: Only one action per turn—either Uncover or Auction.*

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Display  
- Cards revealed via Uncover are placed face-up in a shared display.  
- These are available for purchase during Auctions.

#### Bidding  
- Minimum bid: **1 gold**.  
- Bidding proceeds clockwise; players must overbid or pass.  
- Losers retain their gold; only the winner pays.

#### Card Acquisition  
- Winner of auction selects **any number** of displayed cards.  
- One card may be **removed from the game** (player’s choice).  

#### Turn Progression  
- After an Auction, the winner reveals a new card.  
- Turn order restarts with the player to the **right of the auction winner**.

#### Final Card Trigger  
- When the **last card** of the draw pile is uncovered:  
  - The **gold supply** is divided as evenly as possible among all players.  
  - Any **leftover gold remains in the supply** (not awarded).  
  - The game ends **immediately**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

   - Multiply that sum by **(number of handshakes in the set + 1)**.  
2. **Bonus:** Each set containing **4 or more number cards** receives an **8-point bonus**.  
3. Each **gold token** in possession is worth **1 point**.  
4. Total all points from sets, bonuses, and gold.

**Winning:**  
- The player with the **most points wins**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: What are “wager cards” used for?**  
*A: Not specified in source. Rules mention receiving them but no mechanical use is described.*

**Q: What are the “4 even piles”?**  
*A: Unclear. Possibly setup-related, but no function defined in rules.*

**Q: How are sets defined?**  
*A: Implied (e.g., “each set”), but no guidance on how cards are grouped (by color, symbol, etc.). Critical ambiguity.*

**Q: What happens if the display is empty?**  
*A: Auctions can still occur, but no cards are available to take. Unclear if legal.*

**Q: Can you bid more than you have?**  
*A: Not specified. Assumed that players can only bid available gold.*

**Q: When is the gold supply split?**  
*A: Only when the last card is drawn — divide remaining supply evenly. Leftover gold stays unassigned.*
