## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Quo Vadis?*, players represent powerful Roman patrician families vying for political dominance in ancient Rome. The goal is to advance your Senators through a series of Senate committees to reach the Inner Sanctum—the highest echelon of power. Victory is achieved by having at least one Senator in the Inner Sanctum and the highest total of laurel points. The game captures the intrigue, negotiation, and shifting alliances of Roman politics.

**Win Condition:**  
- The game ends when all five seats in the Inner Sanctum are filled.  
- The winner is the player with the most laurel points **among those who have at least one Senator in the Inner Sanctum**.  
- **Tiebreaker:** The player who first placed a Senator in the Inner Sanctum wins. (Spaces are filled left to right, allowing clear tracking of arrival order.)

### 2. Components  
- **1 Game Board**: Depicts 14 committee areas connected by paths; includes the 5-member Inner Sanctum at the top center.  
- **40 Senators**: 8 plastic Senator figures in each of 5 colors.  
- **62 Laurel Tokens** (black, marked with Roman numerals):  
  - 18 × “I”  
  - 8 × “II”  
  - 6 × “II & Caesar” (depicts Caesar’s profile)  
  - 15 × “III”  
  - 9 × “IV”  
  - 6 × “V”  
- **1 Purple Caesar Token**: Represents Caesar’s favor.  
- **3 Blank Laurel Tokens**: Replacement pieces (not used in standard play).  
- **7 Special Tokens**: For optional rules only (e.g., Seniority, Bureaucracy, Caesar’s Favor, etc.).

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player chooses a color and takes 8 Senators of that color.  
2. Place all 18 “I” Laurel Tokens face up beside the board.  
3. Shuffle the remaining 44 Laurel Tokens and place them face down in a supply pile.  
4. Draw 10 random tokens from the face-down pile and place them face up on the 10 laurel wreath spaces on the board’s paths.  
5. Place the Caesar Token face up on the laurel space directly below the Inner Sanctum (center of the board).  
6. Determine the starting player randomly (e.g., youngest player or roll-off). Play proceeds clockwise.

> *Optional Setup (from variants):*  
> - Use only 10 “I” tokens (3 players), 14 (4 players), or 18 (5 players).  
> - Place special tokens face down beside the board if using optional rules.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, they must choose **exactly one** of the following three actions:

#### A. Place a New Senator  
- Place one of your Senators into any empty seat in one of the four entryway (bottom-row) committees.  
- No vote or cost required.  
- May only be done if at least one seat is available in a starting committee.

#### B. Advance a Senator  
- Move one of your Senators from its current committee to an adjacent higher committee along a connected path.  
- **Requirements**:  
  - You must have **majority support** in the current committee **OR**  
  - The **Caesar Token must be on the path** being used.  
- **Majority Rules**:  
  - 1-member committee: automatic majority (no vote needed).  
  - 3-member committee: need 2 votes.  
  - 5-member committee: need 3 votes.  
  - Votes are based on **committee size**, not current occupancy.  
  - Each Senator in the committee counts as 1 vote (yours or others’).  
- **Empty Seats**: The destination committee must have an open seat.  
- **Laurel Collection**:  
  - If the path contains a visible laurel token and **Caesar is not on the path**, collect it and place it face down in front of you.  
  - Replace it immediately with a random token from the face-down supply.  
  - If the collected token has **Caesar’s profile (II & C)**, you may move the Caesar Token to any laurel space at the **end of your turn** (in addition to your action).  
- **Caesar on Path**:  
  - If Caesar is on the path, **no laurel is collected**, and **no vote occurs** (movement is automatic).  
- **Assistance & Rewards**:  
  - Other players may contribute votes to help you achieve a majority.  
  - For each such vote, the assisting player receives **one “I” laurel token**, but **only up to the number of votes required**.  
  - If more votes are offered than needed, **you choose** which votes count and who receives the “I” tokens.  
  - “I” tokens are only awarded while supply lasts.

#### C. Move Caesar  
- Move the Caesar Token to **any laurel space on the board**, except the one it just occupied (no back-to-back repeats).  
- This action counts as your full turn.  
- Exception: If you collect a “II & C” token during a Senator advance, you may **move Caesar as a bonus action** at the end of your turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Movement Rules**:  
  - You may only move your own Senators.  
  - Movement is **forward only**—no backward or skipping committees.  
  - A Senator may take any valid upward path from a committee, regardless of position within it.  
  - A Senator cannot enter a full committee.  
- **Deals and Promises**:  
  - Players may make deals involving:  
    - Transfer of laurel tokens.  
    - Promises to vote, move/not move Senators or Caesar.  
    - Any combination of current or future actions.  
  - **Binding Promises**: Only promises that can be fulfilled **during the current turn or by the end of the next turn** must be kept.  
  - All other promises are **non-binding** and may be broken.  
  - No external enforcement; trust and reputation are key.  
- **Bribery and Payment**:  
  - Laurel tokens are used as currency.  
  - **No change-making with a bank**—players must settle payments using existing tokens.  
  - If a player lacks exact change, they may receive smaller tokens from the recipient or overpay.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End Trigger**: The game ends **immediately** when the fifth Senator enters the Inner Sanctum.  
- **Eligibility to Win**: Only players with **at least one Senator in the Inner Sanctum** are eligible.  
- **Scoring**: Total all face-down laurel tokens collected during the game.  
- **Winner**: The eligible player with the **highest total** wins.  
- **Tiebreaker**: The player who **first placed a Senator** in the Inner Sanctum wins. (Order is tracked left to right as seats are filled.)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I pass my turn?**  
  No. If you cannot place or advance a Senator, you **must move Caesar**.  
- **Can I retry a vote if I fail?**  
  No. Once you attempt to advance and fail to secure votes, your turn continues only if you switch to another action (e.g., place a new Senator or move Caesar). You cannot re-attempt the same move.  
- **Is a vote required in a 1-member committee?**  
  Technically yes, but it's automatic—no assistance or tokens involved. Special tokens (e.g., Bureaucracy) cannot affect such committees.  
- **Can I combine moving Caesar with another action?**  
  Only if you collect a “II & C” token during a Senator move. Then, moving Caesar is a **bonus action** at turn’s end.  
- **What if I can’t move any Senator or place a new one?**  
  You **must move Caesar** as your action.  
- **Can I include a future Caesar move in a deal?**  
  Yes. Promises to move Caesar on a future turn are **non-binding**, but legal to include in deals.  
- **Can I trade laurels during a vote negotiation?**  
  Yes. Laurel transfers are common and valid parts of deals.
