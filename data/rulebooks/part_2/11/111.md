## Rheinlander – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Centuries ago, powerful dukes ruled separate territories along the Rhine River, gaining wealth from cities and castles. Bishops often mediated power struggles. In *Rheinlander*, players take on the roles of these dukes, competing to expand their influence, control key landmarks, and gain the support of bishops. The goal is to score the most points by forming and controlling duchies—regions of connected spaces occupied by knights—along the Rhine. The player with the highest score at the end of the game becomes the ruler of the Rhine.

### 2. Components  
- 1 gameboard (with 54 numbered areas; each area includes a river space and two land spaces)  
- 54 numbered cards (numbered 1–54)  
- 1 "shuffle" (or "reshuffle") card (functions as a joker)  
- 1 archbishop card  
- 30 duke figures (6 per player in 5-player game)  
- 125 knights (punched counters: 25 per player in 3-player game, 20 in 4-player, 17 in 5-player)  
- 55 coins (for scoring)  
- 7 bishop markers  
- 15 bastion markers  
- 26 realm (landmark) markers:  
  - 12 cities (worth 2, 3, or 4 points)  
  - 7 castles  
  - 7 churches  

### 3. Setup  
1. **Place Landmarks**: Shuffle all 26 realm markers face down. Place one face up on each circular building site on the board. Each game features a unique layout.  
2. **Distribute Player Pieces**:  
   - 3 players: Each gets 6 dukes, 25 knights, and 3 bastions.  
   - 4 players: Each gets 20 knights (dukes and bastions as above).  
   - 5 players: Each gets 17 knights (dukes and bastions as above).  
3. **Prepare the Deck**: Remove the archbishop card from the deck. Shuffle the remaining 54 cards (including the shuffle card). Deal 5 cards to each player. Place the rest face down as the draw pile.  
   - If a player is dealt the shuffle card, return it to the deck and draw a replacement.  
4. **Assign Banker**: One player becomes the banker, responsible for distributing coins.  
5. **Place Neutral Components**: Set the archbishop card and bishop markers beside the board.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Play proceeds clockwise. On a player’s turn, they perform three steps in order:  
1. **Play a Card**: Choose one card from hand and place it face up on the discard pile.  
2. **Place a Knight or Bastion**:  
   - Place one knight on the board (see below for placement rules), **or**  
   - Place one bastion (in addition to the knight).  
3. **Draw a Card**: Draw one card from the draw pile to restore a 5-card hand.  

**Special Rule – Shuffle Card**:  
If a player draws the shuffle card, return it to the deck, shuffle the discard pile into the deck, and draw a new card. The shuffle card cannot be kept.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Placing Knights  
- Each area (numbered 1–54) has three spaces: two land (left and right) and one river.  
- A knight may occupy any land space unless blocked.  
- A river space may only be occupied if both adjacent land spaces are already occupied.  
- Only one knight per space.  
- Some spaces (on islands) belong to two areas and can be accessed via either card.

#### Playing by Card Number  
- Play a card to place a knight in the corresponding area.  
- Choose one of the two land spaces in that area (if unoccupied).  
- If one land space is occupied, place on the other.  
- If both are occupied, place on the river space (if free).  
- If all three spaces are full, you may still play the card (see Reinforcements).

#### Reinforcements  
Instead of using the card number, a player may play **any** card as a reinforcement:  
- Ignore the card’s number.  
- Place a knight on any **free land space** that:  
  - Is adjacent to one of your knights, and  
  - Is **not** adjacent to any opponent’s knight.  
- Cannot place on river spaces.  
- Cannot use reinforcement to convert opponent knights.

#### Placing Bastions  
- On your turn, after placing a knight, you may place one of your three bastions.  
- Can be placed on any free land space.  
- Cannot be placed on river spaces.  
- Bastions are neutral, do not belong to any duchy, and block knight placement.

#### Forming Duchies  
- A **duchy** is formed when two or more adjacent (edge-sharing) spaces are occupied by knights.  
- Duchies may contain knights of multiple colors.  
- A player **owns** a duchy if:  
  - They have at least two knights in it, and  
  - They have **more knights** than any other single player.  
- Place a duke figure beside the duchy to mark ownership.  
- Ties prevent ownership: if two players have equal knights, no new duke can be placed.

#### Scoring During the Game  
- Points are scored **only** when a duchy changes ownership or is dissolved (e.g., via merging).  
- When a player loses ownership of a duchy, they receive its value in coins (paid by the banker).  
- Coins are kept face down to conceal score.

#### Changing Ownership  
- When a knight is placed such that a player now has more knights in a duchy than the current owner, they take over.  
- The old duke is returned, and the owner scores the **old duchy’s value**.  
- The new owner places their duke.  
- If a placement results in a tie, ownership does **not** change.

#### Merging Duchies  
- Placing a knight adjacent to two or more duchies merges them into one.  
- Ownership of the new duchy goes to the player with the most knights.  
  - If you owned one of the original duchies, your duke remains.  
  - If you owned multiple, the **highest-scoring** duke remains; others are removed and scored.  
- If no player has a majority (tie), **all dukes are removed** and players score their old duchies. The new duchy has no owner.

#### Castles  
- A castle is claimed when the **first knight** is placed adjacent to it.  
- If the knight is part of a **duchy with a duke**, the **duke’s owner** claims the castle and places an additional knight on it.  
- If the knight is in an **ownerless duchy**, the placing player claims the castle and may place an additional knight. They may then claim the duchy if they have a majority.  
- A knight is always placed on the castle; it remains occupied for the game.  
- **Castles change hands** when the duchy changes ownership: the new owner replaces all knights in castles within the duchy with their own.

#### Churches and Bishops  
- A duchy with at least one **church** allows the owner to place a **bishop marker** under their duke.  
- The player with **more bishops than any other player** takes the **archbishop card**.  
  - If tied or no bishops, the card remains unclaimed.  
- Holding the archbishop grants **conversion power**:  
  - When playing a card by number (not reinforcement), if the land space contains an **opponent’s knight**, you may replace it with your own.  
  - Only one conversion per turn.  
  - Cannot convert knights in castles or on bastions.  
  - Conversion may trigger ownership changes.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End**: The game ends immediately after a player places their **last knight**. That player completes their turn (including any castle placements or conversions).  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - Each **duke on the board** scores **5 points** (instead of 1 during the game).  
  - Each **city, castle, and church** in a duchy scores as during the game:  
    - Church: 1 point  
    - Castle: 1 point  
    - City: 2, 3, or 4 points (as marked)  
  - **Archbishop holder**: +5 points.  
- All points are paid in coins. The player with the most coins wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a card whose area is full?**  
  Yes. You may still play it as a reinforcement.  
- **Can I use a reinforcement to place next to my knight on a castle?**  
  No. Knights on castles do **not** count for reinforcement adjacency. Only land knights matter.  
- **Do bastions block adjacency for duchies?**  
  Yes. A bastion breaks duchy continuity. Knights on either side of a bastion are not adjacent.  
- **Can I convert a knight adjacent to a castle?**  
  Yes, but only the land knight is converted; the knight **on the castle** remains.  
- **What if two players tie for most bishops?**  
  No one gets the archbishop card.  
- **Can a duchy of two knights (one on each side of the river) be formed?**  
  Only if the two spaces are adjacent (i.e., share an edge). Most river-adjacent spaces are not directly adjacent unless connected via island or bend.  
- **Can I place a bastion and use a reinforcement on the same turn?**  
  Yes. Place the knight via reinforcement, then place a bastion on a different space.
