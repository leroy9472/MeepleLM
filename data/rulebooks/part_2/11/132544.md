## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Tesla vs Edison: War of Currents*, players take on the roles of historical electrical companies competing during the late 19th-century "War of Currents" to dominate the emerging electrical infrastructure. The goal is to maximize victory points (VP) through stock value, cash holdings, developed HQ cards, and project control. The player with the most VP at game end wins. Tiebreaker: Present Fame order.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with map of U.S. cities, technology tracks (AC, DC, Bulb), fame tracks (Present/Future, AC/DC), and stock market  
- Turn track and phase marker  
- Company cubes (for projects, fame, stock)  
- Acrylic bulb and lightning markers (for turn and AC/DC track)  
- Luminaries (action cards with $, Propaganda ▲, and tech icons)  
- Propaganda cards (▲)  
- Event cards (*)  
- Stock certificates (preferred and regular)  
- HQ mats and HQ cards  
- AI player cards (by difficulty: Babbage, Lovelace, Turing, Hopper)  
- Cash ($1k denominations)

### 3. Setup  
1. Place turn marker (acrylic bulb or brown cube) before Phase 1 on the turn track.  
2. Place AC/DC Fame marker on START.  
3. Each human player receives $14k. AI players receive no cash.  
4. Create decks:  
   - Luminaries: Randomly select based on player count; return extras to box.  
   - Propaganda cards: Select appropriate number per player count.  
   - Event cards: Remove Delmonico's, Joseph Swan, Gerlach Hotel, Pullman Strike if >1 human. Randomly select 2 per phase; place face-down in stacks.  
5. Draft companies in turn order:  
   a. Each player (and AI) selects a company, takes inventor, HQ mat, face-down HQ cards, preferred shares, and cubes.  
   b. Set aside 2 regular stock certificates for Phase 2 luminary auction.  
   c. Place remaining regular stocks in open market.  
   d. Place company cubes:  
      - On lowest-rank (highest-numbered) empty space of PRESENT and FUTURE fame tracks  
      - On START (Level I) of AC, DC, and Bulb tech tracks  
      - On space 12 of stock market track  
6. Choose AI difficulty (Babbage < Lovelace < Turing < Hopper) for each AI player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 6 phases. Each phase follows this sequence:

#### 1. Phase Start: Luminary Auction / Propaganda Refresh  
a. Reveal luminaries for the phase.  
b. **Phase 2 only**: Shuffle set-aside stock certificates and deal one randomly to each luminary; return unused stocks to box.  
c. **Luminary Auction**:  
   - Starting with highest-ranked player on Present Fame who hasn’t won a luminary, open bidding on a luminary.  
   - Minimum bid: phase × $2k (not $1k).  
   - Bidding proceeds clockwise; players may increase bid or pass.  
   - Last remaining player wins, pays bank, takes luminary and any attached stock.  
   - Repeat until all humans have a luminary or opt out.  
d. Remaining luminaries form a deck; deal one (and random stock if any) to each player who didn’t win, for $1k paid to bank.  
e. Deal one luminary and stock to each AI (return luminary to box; AI never uses luminaries).  
f. Leave leftover luminaries visible with random stocks; used in next auction.  
g. Remove previous propaganda cards; reveal new ones for the phase.  
h. Advance turn marker to next phase.

#### 2. Reveal Event Card (*)  
a. Apply primary effect if applicable.  
b. Stock market effects (Up 2, Up 1, No effect, Left 1, Left 2) apply to all players.  
c. If “× AUCTION ×”, auction in Present Fame order, min bid $1k.  
d. Multiplayer rules:  
   - Auction min bid = phase × $2k  
   - If no winner, apply only stock market effect  
   - AI actions cannot be blocked by event effects  
   - If AI must pay a human, bank pays instead

#### 3. AI Actions (in Present Fame order)  
Each AI performs all actions on its card in this order:  
a. **Engage in Propaganda**:  
   - Take available propaganda card that moves indicated marker farthest (tie: higher $).  
   - Move own company’s fame or AC/DC marker up to +1/+2 as specified.  
   - Flip card face down; if all face down, flip all up.  
b. **Advance in Technology**:  
   - Advance AC, DC, or Bulb to indicated level.  
   - If $ icon present, claim patent if unclaimed → increase stock price by patent level.  
c. **Claim a Project**:  
   - i. **Technology Match**: Prefer lower project in matching city; else closest possible project.  
   - ii. **Patents**: For each tech used, bank pays patent holder: phase × AI’s tech level  
   - iii. **Stock Market**: Move stock: Project Profitability ± AC/DC Fame value. ×2 if Level V.  
   - iv. **Claim**: Place cube on project.  
d. **Develop HQ**: Flip indicated HQ card face-up (no immediate effect; scoring only).

#### 4. Player Actions (in Present Fame order)  
Each player with face-up luminaries must exhaust one to take an action:

**Pass**: Flip any luminary face down to skip turn.

**Claim a Project** (exhaust one luminary):  
- i. **Tech Requirements**: Your Bulb tech and either AC or DC tech ≥ project number (if AC=DC, choose).  
- ii. **Cost**: City size cost + phase × (cities skipped – luminary’s $ rating) → paid to bank  
- iii. **Patents**: Pay each patent holder: your tech level (not × phase)  
- iv. **Stock Market**: Move stock: Project Profitability ± AC/DC Fame value. ×2 if Level V.  
- v. **Claim**: Place cube on project.

**Advance in Technology** (exhaust one or more luminaries):  
- i. Advance one tech up to total $ rating of exhausted luminaries.  
- ii. Must cover all $ and manufacturing costs of levels advanced.  
- iii. **Patent**: If final level’s patent is unclaimed and total $ rating ≥ levels advanced, claim it.  
- iv. **Stock**: Increase stock price by level of patent claimed.

**Engage in Propaganda** (exhaust one luminary):  
- i. Move Future Fame or AC/DC marker up/down ≤ luminary’s ▲ rating.  
- ii. Take available propaganda card:  
   - Move same or other marker ≤ amount shown on card  
   - Gain cash shown + phase × luminary’s $ rating  
- iii. Discard card (flip face down; if all face down, flip all up).

**Develop HQ** (exhaust matching-skill luminary):  
- Flip matching HQ card face-up and apply effect.

**Visit Stock Market** (exhaust one luminary):  
- Buy and/or sell stocks (cannot both buy and sell same company in one turn).  
- **Buying**:  
   - Pay: current price – (phase × luminary’s $ rating)  
   - Take stock from market  
   - Increase stock price by phase number  
- **Selling**:  
   - Return stock to market  
   - Gain: current price + (phase × luminary’s $ rating)  
   - Move stock price one space left (down if no space)  
- Each transaction adjusts price before next.

#### 5. Bookkeeping  
a. Set Present Fame track order to match Future Fame.  
b. Increase stock price of company highest on Present Fame by phase number.  
c. For more famous tech (AC or DC) on AC/DC Fame track:  
   - Increase stock of company with highest patent in that tech by phase number  
   - If tied, apply to both AC and DC leaders  
d. Move AC/DC Fame marker one space toward START.  
e. Each player gains Profit shown under their stock price column.  
f. In Present Fame order, each player may:  
   - **Exchange a stock** (humans only): Sell one, buy another, cash makes up difference.  
     - Move sold stock price left one space (except turn 6)  
     - Increase bought stock price by phase number (except turn 6)  
   - **Buy a stock** (AI always does): Same as player buy action  
g. Flip all luminaries face up.  
h. Discard Event card.  
i. Advance turn marker; cycle AI to next phase card.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Technology Track**: AC, DC, Bulb. Advance using luminaries. Only final level patented.  
- **Patents**:  
   - Claim when advancing tech if:  
     - Patent unclaimed  
     - Total $ rating of luminaries ≥ levels advanced  
   - Only one owner per patent  
   - When used by others: pay holder $1k × patent level (not × phase)  
- **Stock Market**:  
   - Affected by:  
     - Project claims (Profitability ± AC/DC Fame, ×2 for V)  
     - Patent claims (+ level)  
     - Stock buys (+ phase)  
     - Stock sells (–1 left)  
     - Fame leadership (+ phase)  
     - Bookkeeping phase bonuses  
- **Fame Tracks**:  
   - Present Fame: Determines turn order and AI actions  
   - Future Fame: Becomes Present Fame during Bookkeeping  
   - AC/DC Fame: Influences stock movement and phase bonuses

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After Phase 6:  
- **Stock Value**: Each stock earns VP based on its price rank among companies:  
  - Rank 1: 6 VP  
  - Rank 2: 4 VP  
  - Rank 3: 2 VP  
  - Rank 4: 1 VP  
- **Cash**: Compare total cash:  
  - Most: 6 VP  
  - Second: 4 VP  
  - Third: 2 VP  
  - Fourth: 1 VP  
- **HQ Cards**: Only developed (face-up) cards count. Score VP as printed.  
- **Works Card**: If developed and criteria met, score printed VP.

**Total VP = Stock + Cash + HQ + Works**  
- **Winner**: Most VP. Tiebreaker: Present Fame order.  
- **Game End Rule**: If tie persists, the player with the most valuable stock portfolio wins. Further tiebreaker: most cash.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **AI and Patents**: AI pays bank, not player, when using patented tech.  
- **Patent Payment**: Always equal to tech level (e.g., Level III = $3k), not multiplied by phase.  
- **Stock Buy/Sell Limit**: Cannot buy and sell same company in one turn.  
- **Stock Ownership Limit**: Max 4 shares in any one opponent’s company via market; exceptions from auctions allowed.  
- **Event Cards**: Stock effects apply even if primary effect is ignored (e.g., single-player).  
- **Propaganda Cards**: Use card that moves marker farthest; if maxed, increase AI stock by phase.  
- **Project Claiming**: AI takes lower project in city if available.  
- **Stock Price Limits**: Markers cannot go beyond track ends.  
- **Ties**: Human always wins tie against AI.
