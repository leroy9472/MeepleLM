## Rook for 2 – Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Rook for 2 is a two-player adaptation of the traditional four-player Rook card game, designed to simulate team play using card racks to represent "Dummy" hands. The objective is to score points by winning tricks and fulfilling bids, following standard four-player Rook rules as closely as possible while accommodating two players.

2. Components  
- Standard Rook deck (typically 57 cards: numbered cards 1–14 in four colors, plus the Rook Bird card)  
- Two card racks (each with angled slots to hold cards)  
- Two "Dummy" racks (placed opposite each player)  

3. Setup  
- Players sit opposite each other, each with a "Dummy" rack positioned across from them (as shown in a diagram referenced in the source).  
- One player is randomly chosen as the dealer (e.g., Player B).  
- The dealer shuffles and deals cards as if four players were present:  
  - Each real player receives 14 cards.  
  - The remaining 28 cards are dealt to the two "Dummy" racks (14 cards each).  
- Each player arranges the 14 cards dealt to their *opposite* "Dummy" rack in the angled slots, organizing them by color.  
- The cards in a player’s own "Dummy" rack are visible only to that player; opponents cannot see them due to the rack’s angled design.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- The game proceeds as in standard 4-player Rook:  
  - Bidding occurs first (exact bidding rules not detailed in source, but assumed standard).  
  - After bidding, play proceeds trick by trick.  
  - The winner of each trick leads to the next.  
- Players play cards from their own hand or from their "Dummy" hand as applicable, depending on the game variant and bid outcome.  
- In games where the rules require 14 cards per player, two cards must be placed in one of the end slots of the card racks (exact purpose not specified, likely structural).

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Dummy Play**: After winning the bid, a player controls both their hand and their "Dummy" hand, just as in standard Rook.  
- **Visibility**: Each player can see their own hand and their "Dummy" hand fully. Opponent’s hand and "Dummy" hand are hidden.  
- **Special Rule for DISPLAY and BOSTON Games**:  
  - In these variants, the winning bidder’s "Dummy" hand is *not* exposed on the table.  
  - Instead, it is placed in the rack like in other games.  
  - This prevents one player from seeing three hands (their own, their Dummy, and exposed Dummy), which would reveal all card locations.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Scoring follows standard 4-player Rook rules (not detailed in source).  
- Game ends when a predetermined score (e.g., 300 points) is reached (assumed standard; exact target not specified).  
- The team (player + their Dummy) that meets or exceeds the bid earns points; underbidding or overbidding penalties apply as per standard rules.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can a player see their opponent’s "Dummy" hand?**  
  A: No. The angled rack design ensures only the controlling player sees the "Dummy" cards.  
- **Q: When are cards placed in the racks?**  
  A: Cards are placed in the racks during setup. In some games, placement is delayed until after bidding.  
- **Q: What happens in DISPLAY or BOSTON games?**  
  A: The winning bidder’s "Dummy" is not exposed; it remains in the rack to prevent excessive information access.  
- **Q: How are tricks played involving "Dummy"?**  
  A: After winning the bid, the player plays from both their hand and "Dummy" hand alternately during tricks, as per standard Rook rules.
