# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In *Merchants of Amsterdam*, players take on the roles of powerful merchant families in 17th-century Amsterdam, a thriving hub of global trade. The game follows the historical rise and decline of the city from 1579 to 1666, with events on the time track reflecting real historical milestones. Players aim to increase their wealth by investing in the commodity market, building warehouses in Amsterdam, and establishing trade offices in the colonies. The player with the most money after final scoring wins.

## 2. Components

## 3. Setup
- Place the time passage figure on the first space of the time track (1579).
- For 3-player games: remove all cards marked with the 3-player restriction symbol.
- Each player:
  - Receives $400,000 from the bank.
  - Chooses a color and takes 24 tokens.
  - Places one token on each numbered space matching their player order (e.g., Player 1 places on all ① spaces).
- The first player takes the three disks (mayor, auction, discard) and the auction clock.
- Shuffle the deck and place it face down.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
On a player's turn (as mayor):

1. **Draw and assign cards**:
   - Draw the top card. Choose to place it on one of the three disks: Mayor, Auction, or Discard.
   - Repeat for second and third cards, using each disk exactly once.
   - **Sand clock card exception**: If drawn, immediately:
     - Move the time passage figure one space forward.
     - Resolve any event on the new space (starting with player to the left of mayor, then clockwise).
     - Discard the sand clock card.
     - Draw a replacement card to place on an empty disk.
     - Sand clock cards are never placed on disks.

2. **Resolve actions in order**:
   - **Discard Disk**: Discard the card without effect.
   - **Mayor Disk**: Mayor performs the card’s action at no cost.
   - **Auction Disk**: Conduct a Dutch auction using the auction clock. The winner pays the bid amount and performs the action.

3. **Auction Rules (Dutch Auction)**:
   - Start the auction clock; pointer moves counter-clockwise from high to low prices.
   - Any player (including mayor) may stop the clock to claim the card at the current price.
   - If pointer reaches 50, auction ends with no winner.
   - If a player stops the clock at 200 or above, the auction restarts at double prices.
     - If no one bids before 100 in the double auction, the player who triggered doubling buys it for $200,000.
   - If a player cannot pay, auction restarts; that player may not bid again.

4. End of turn:
   - After auction resolution, the mayor passes all three disks to the left.
   - Next player begins their turn.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Card Types
- **Commodity Card**:
  - Perform 3 moves on the commodity market (sugar, gemstones, spices, silk).
  - Each move: advance a token one space forward or place a token on an empty track (on first space).
  - Cannot use all 3 moves on the same track.
  - Max one token per player per track.

- **Trade Office Card**:
  - Open a trade office by placing a token in a valid colony space (as specified by card: region(s) and/or commodity).
  - If space is occupied, action is lost.
  - After placement, advance your corresponding commodity market token one space (place if absent).

- **Amsterdam Card**:
  - Build a warehouse in a valid district (as specified by card).
  - If no space available, action is lost.
  - Advance your corresponding commodity market token one space (place if absent). If card allows any commodity, choose one.

- **Sand Clock Card**:
  - Not assigned to disks.
  - Triggers time track advancement and event resolution.
  - Discarded immediately after use.

### Time Track Events
When the time passage figure lands on a space with a symbol:
- **Ship**: Each player advances one commodity token one space or places one on a track where they have none.
- **Globe**: Each player places a trade office in any empty colony space and advances the corresponding commodity token.
- **Amsterdam Coat of Arms**: Each player builds a warehouse in any empty space in Amsterdam.
- **Credit Note (f120,f200)**: Each player may borrow $120,000 (take credit marker; repay $200,000 at game end).
- **Warehouse Loss**: Each player removes one warehouse of their choice.
- **Trade Office Loss**: Each player removes one trade office of their choice.
- **Ship Wreck**: Each player moves one commodity token one space backward; if on first space, remove it.
- **Commodity Market Leaders Lose One Space**: On each commodity track, all leading tokens (furthest right) move back one space.
- **Scoring Spaces**:
  - Intermediate scoring for commodity market, Amsterdam warehouses, and colony trade offices.
  - Final scoring at 1666 scores all three areas.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
### Scoring Mechanics
At each scoring space (intermediate and final):
- Score **four parts per area**:
  - Commodity Market: 4 commodities
  - Amsterdam: 4 districts
  - Colonies: 4 regions

#### Ranking
- **Commodity Market**: Rank by furthest-right token. Tiebreaker: commodity number (sugar=1, gemstones=2, spice=3, silk=4).
- **Amsterdam & Colonies**: Rank by number of tokens. Tiebreaker: district/region number.

#### Payout
- For each rank, top two players earn money:
  - 1st place: top amount
  - 2nd place: bottom amount
- **Tie for 1st**: Combine both payouts, divide by number tied, round down. No 2nd place payout.
- **Tie for 2nd**: Split 2nd-place amount among tied players, round down.

#### Special Amsterdam Scoring
- In each district, count largest orthogonally adjacent group of warehouses.
- Only largest group per player counts for scoring.
- Single tokens count as size 1.

### Bonuses
- **Market Bonus**: Have tokens on all 4 commodity tracks (each at least 2nd space) → build a warehouse in Amsterdam for free.
- **Colony Bonus**: Have at least one trade office in each of the 4 regions → receive $100,000.
- **Amsterdam Bonus**: Have at least one warehouse in each of the 4 districts → receive $100,000.
- **Bridge Bonus**: Build a warehouse adjacent across a bridge from one of your existing warehouses → receive $40,000.

> **Note**: If a player no longer meets bonus conditions, they lose the bonus:
> - Return money if required (if insufficient funds, take $120,000 loan, repay $200,000 at end).
> - Remove warehouse if bonus required a free build.

### Game End
- Game ends at the end of the turn when the time passage figure reaches **1665**.
- After the player finishes their turn, move the figure to **1666** and conduct final scoring.
- If the last card drawn is a sand clock card, the player does not take a normal turn (no card actions).
- Final scoring includes all three areas (commodity market, Amsterdam, colonies).
- Players:
  - Total their money.
  - Subtract $200,000 for each credit marker held.
- Player with most money wins. Ties result in shared victory.
