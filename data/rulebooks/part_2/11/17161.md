## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Players represent civilizations on the island of Tempus, evolving from primitive tribes into advanced societies across 10 eras. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VPs) by controlling land, building cities, and advancing to the Flight Era. Progress through eras is determined by Progress Points, and actions improve over time as new technologies are unlocked.

2. Components

- 12 Map Tiles (combinations of Grasslands, Farmlands, Mountains, Woods, Hills)  
- 5 Sets of:  
  - 8 City Tiles per player (values: 3×2, 3×3, 2×4)  
  - 16 People Tokens (disks) per player  
  - 6 Action Tiles per player  
- 1 Era Cube per player (color-coded)  
- 1 First Player Marker (white)

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn is an Era, consisting of 4 phases:

**Phase 1 – Take Action Tiles**  
Each player takes Action Tiles equal to the "Actions per Turn" value in the row of their Era Cube on the Era Display.

**Phase 2 – Spend Action Tiles & Perform Actions**  
Players take turns clockwise, spending one Action Tile at a time to perform one of five actions. Multiple actions per turn allowed. Actions:

a) **Move People**  
- Land: Move up to # tokens shown in "Movement" column, each up to "Distance" hexes.  
  - Cannot move into city or opponent’s hex.  
  - Can move through own city or token stacks.  
  - Stacking limit must be respected at end.  
  - Each token moved only once per action.  
- Lake: From one land hex adjacent to a lake to any other land hex adjacent to the same lake. Consumes full movement.  
- Sea: Available only from Era with "Ships" icon. Move from coastal hex to any other coastal hex. Consumes full movement.

b) **Have Babies**  
- Only in Grassland hexes with at least one of your tokens.  
- One baby (token) per hex.  
- Total babies placed limited by "Babies" value in Era Display.  
- Cannot exceed stacking limit (unless Sanitation card played).  
- Supply of tokens is limited (16 per player).

c) **Have a Fight**  
- Initiated by active player.  
- Attack from one hex to one adjacent enemy hex (token or city). No attacks across water.  
- Cannot attack opponent with 3 or fewer occupied hexes (cities not counted).  
- Defender must declare city terrain type before card play (if attacking city).  
- Card Play Order:  
  1. Attacker chooses to play cards face down.  
  2. Defender plays cards face up.  
  3. Attacker reveals played cards.  
- Combat Points:  
  - Each token: 1 point  
  - Defending city: value on tile  
  - Matching terrain Idea Card: 1 point  
  - Weapon card: 1 point  
  - Fortification card (defender only): 2 points  
- Highest total wins. Defender wins ties.  
- Outcomes:  
  - Defender loses: Remove all tokens or city; attacker moves any number of attackers into hex.  
  - Attacker loses: Remove 1 attacking token.  
- All played Idea Cards are discarded.

d) **Have an Idea**  
- Draw # cards shown in first number of "Ideas" row.  
- Hand limit is second number. Excess cards discarded immediately.  
- Deck reshuffled if empty.  
- Idea Cards may be played at any time during your turn (not an action).  
- Uses: special effect, combat bonus (matching terrain), Progress bonus (matching terrain).

e) **Build a City**  
- Remove all tokens from a hex; return to stock.  
- Place City Tile with value ≤ number of tokens removed.  
- Cannot build:  
  - Adjacent to another city  
  - On Mountain or Sea hex  
- City’s terrain is declared by owner when defending.

**Phase 3 – Progress**  
Triggered when all Action Tiles are spent.

1. **Catch-Up**: All players move Era Cubes to match the most advanced player(s).  
2. **Progress Phase**:  
   - In player order, each may play any number of Idea Cards face down.  
   - Reveal and calculate Progress Points (PP):  
     - 1 PP per token in hex matching New Era’s terrain  
     - 1 PP per Idea Card with matching background terrain  
     - 1 PP per Education card played  
     - 1 PP per City on map  
   - Player(s) with highest PP advance to New Era (next unattained box).  
   - **Bonuses**: First to Writing or Printing Era immediately draw 2 Idea Cards.

**Phase 4 – End of the Era**  
- Remove all Action Tiles from Player Aid Sheets and place beside.  
- Pass First Player Marker clockwise.  
- Begin new Era.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Era Display**: Grid showing action capabilities per era. Rows correspond to eras; columns show:  
  - Movement: # tokens moved  
  - Distance: max hexes moved  
  - Babies: # tokens added  
  - Stack Limit: max tokens per hex  
  - Ships: sea movement allowed?  
  - Ideas: draw / hand limit  
  - Actions per Turn: # Action Tiles drawn  
- **Idea Cards**:  
  - Special effects (e.g., Military Leader = free attack)  
  - Terrain background used in combat and Progress  
  - Not actions; can be played during your turn or when defending  
- **Stacking**: Limited by current era’s Stack Limit. Sanitation card allows +1 per card.  
- **Adjacency**: Only direct hex neighbors. Lakes and sea break adjacency.

6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Condition**: Game ends after the Progress phase in which one or more players advance to the Flight Era.

**Victory Points**:  
- 1 VP per non-Mountain hex with your token(s)  
- 1 VP per City Tile × its value  
- 3 VP bonus for each player who reached Flight Era

**Tiebreakers**:  
1. Most Idea Cards in hand  
2. Most City Tiles on board  
3. Shared victory if still tied

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **City Building Timing**: Can build cities at any time (no need to wait for "Cities" era).  
- **Religion Card**: Move and convert one adjacent opponent token (not city). Does not count as attack. Cannot exceed stacking limit.  
- **Government Card**: Choose:  
  - Use 2 actions in a row, or  
  - Pass and delay all remaining actions by one round (still only 1 action per round).  
  - Discard at end of turn.  
- **Sanitation Card**: Allows +1 stacking per card in one hex. Remains active until a token is moved out. Multiple cards can stack effects.  
- **Medicine Card**: +1 baby per turn (beyond era limit), still subject to 1 per Grassland hex.  
- **Military Leader**: One free attack during your turn (before, during, or after regular action).  
- **Atlantis (Expansion)**:  
  - Use 1 action to move 5 tokens from coast to sea hex.  
  - Return 4 to stock; place Atlantis (blue city) and 1 token.  
  - Worth 5 VP at game end.  
  - Requires Sea Movement capability.  
- **Card Bluffing**: Allowed in combat and Progress. All played cards are discarded.  
- **City Terrain Declaration**: Can change per attack; declared before card play.  
- **Hex Control for Attacks**: Only tokens count for "3 or fewer hexes" rule; cities do not.
