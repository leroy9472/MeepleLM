## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Eighty years after the nanopocalypse, Earth lies in ruins. Players are post-humans striving to rebuild civilization by constructing colonies using scarce resources. The goal is to be the first to reach the required Victory Points (VPs) based on player count:  
- 4 players: 15 VPs  
- 3 players: 16 VPs  
- 2 players: 20 VPs  
A player wins immediately when their turn ends and they meet or exceed the threshold.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Place Shared Components:**  
   - Put Stable Resources, Unstable Resources, and CHIPIs in supply.  
   - Place Scoreboard centrally; each player places their marker at "0".  

2. **Lay Out Basic Cards:**  
   - Place stacks of:  
     - GMO Farm x6  
     - Protein Lab x6  
     - Fabric Replicator x6  
     - Fiber Mill x6  
     - Uranium Mine x6  
     - Fallout Shelter x8  
   - All placed basic (white) side up.  

3. **Select Variable Cards:**  
   - Choose 7 types of Variable Cards (e.g., Attack, Production, Trade, etc.).  
   - Each stack contains a number of cards equal to player count:  
     - 2P: 2 per stack  
     - 3P: 3 per stack  
     - 4P: 4 per stack  
   - Place all stacks basic side up.  

4. **Player Setup:**  
   - Each player takes:  
     a. One each of: Warehouse, Supply Exchange, Upgrade, Construction (basic side up).  
     b. 3 Stable Resources: roll them, sum values.  
   - Lowest sum becomes First Player. Retie until unique.  
   - In 4P games: 4th player (to First Player’s right) receives 1 CHIPI.  

5. **First Game Variant (Optional):**  
   - Turn Upgrade and Construction cards to 2.0 side.  
   - Move score markers to "1".  
   - Use recommended first-game Variable Cards.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, phases occur in order:  
1. **Prepare**  
2. **Scavenge**  
3. **Activate**  
4. **Clean-up**

#### Phase 1: Prepare  
- Move all dice from Warehouse (and Time-Lock Vault, if applicable) to Play Area.  
- Activate any Prepare-phase abilities (e.g., Gambling Den).  

#### Phase 2: Scavenge  
- Active player takes 3 Stable Resources from supply, rolls them.  
- Chooses one to place in Play Area (keeps facing).  
- Passes remaining two:  
  - Left neighbor takes one for Warehouse.  
  - Next player takes last one for Warehouse.  
- **Player Count Variants:**  
  - 2P: Active player takes final die.  
  - 4P: 4th player receives nothing.  
- **CHIPI Use:**  
  - Active player may spend up to 3 CHIPIs.  
  - Each CHIPI grants 1 Unstable Resource, rolled with the 3 Stable ones.  
  - Active player keeps all rolled Unstable Resources.  

#### Phase 3: Activate  
- Player may activate any number of cards (once per card per turn), in any order.  
- Tap (tilt) each activated card.  
- Cannot activate cards built this turn.  

**Building:**  
- Construction card allows building one card (pay cost in black at top).  
- Cost may use Stable or Unstable Resources.  
- Built card placed near Play Area, basic side up.  
- **Construction 2.0:** Allows building any number of cards per turn.  

**Upgrading:**  
- Upgrade card used once per turn.  
- Pay upgrade cost (varies by card).  
- Flip target card to 2.0 side.  
- Apply “on upgrading” ability.  
- 1.0 ability no longer usable.  

**CHIPI Reward:**  
- If no new card is built (upgrading does not count), gain:  
  - 1 CHIPI (Construction 1.0)  
  - 2 CHIPIs (Construction 2.0)  

**Card Discard Option (Once per Turn):**  
- Discard any card (including starters).  
- Gain Stable Resources equal to difference between own score and leader’s (from end of last turn).  
- Roll and place in Play Area.  
- Discarded card removed from game.  
- VPs on discarded card are lost.  

#### Phase 4: Clean-up  
- Add newly built cards to Colony.  
- Untap all cards.  
- Return unused Unstable Resources to supply.  
- Store Stable Resources in Warehouse or Time-Lock Vault.  
- Any excess Stable Resources (beyond storage) returned to supply (player chooses which).  
  - Must store if space available.  
- Adjust score on Scoreboard.  
- Next player (left) becomes active.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Resources  
- Represented by dice (1–6):  
  1 = Scrap Metal  
  2 = GMO  
  3 = Protein  
  4 = Polymer Fabric  
  5 = Fiber  
  6 = Uranium  
- **Stable (white):** Can be stored.  
- **Unstable (transparent):** Must be used by end of turn or returned to supply.  
- Resources never modified below 1 or above 6.  
- Unlimited supply (use substitutes if needed).  

#### CHIPIs  
- Represent stored Unstable Resources (re-rolled when used).  
- Gained from: Construction (end-of-turn), Experimental Generator, Recycling Bin.  
- Spent during Scavenge: 1 CHIPI → 1 Unstable Resource (rolled).  
- Max 3 used per turn.  
- Unlimited quantity.  

#### Cards  
- **Activation:** Once per turn unless reactivated (e.g., Reactivator).  
- **Building:** Requires Construction card. Cannot activate same turn.  
- **Upgrading:** Turns card to 2.0 side; better abilities, more VPs. Cannot upgrade same turn built.  
- **Multiple Copies:** Allowed; each can be activated independently.  

#### VPs (Victory Points)  
- Represented by orange half-circles (each = 1 VP).  
- Some cards (e.g., Paragon) award variable VPs:  
  - **Fallout Shelter:** 1 = 1 VP, 2 = 3 VP, 3 = 6 VP, etc. (triangular numbers).  
  - **Fallout Shelter 2.0:** 1 = 2 VP, 2 = 6 VP, 3 = 10 VP, etc.  
  - Cannot mix basic and 2.0 for scoring.  
  - **Investment Bank:** Value tracked on card; increased by paying Uranium.  
  - **Stockpile:** 1 VP per set of matching stable resources (must fit in storage).  

#### Defensive Cards  
- Trigger automatically when attacked.  
- One activation per attack.  
- Reset during Clean-up.  
- Examples:  
  - **Barricade:** Ignore one attack.  
  - **Chain Link Fence:** Roll 1–3 to ignore attack.  
  - **Force Field:** Spend counter to ignore attack.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Score updated at end of each turn.  
- Game ends immediately when a player reaches:  
  - 4P: 15 VPs  
  - 3P: 16 VPs  
  - 2P: 20 VPs  
- Winner is the first to meet threshold at end of their turn.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Tied Scavenge Rolls:** Retie until one player has lowest sum.  
- **Full Warehouse:** When receiving a die, may swap or return new die.  
- **Discarding Cards:** Can discard any card, even if activated. VPs lost.  
- **Resource Limits:** No physical limit; use substitutes if dice run out.  
- **Upgrading Same Turn Built:** Not allowed.  
- **Activating Built Card:** Not allowed same turn.  
- **CHIPIs and Storage:** CHIPIs are not resources; they are tokens.  
- **Trading:** Requires Trade card. Opponent must agree. Cannot trade Unstable Resources or same-type resources.  
- **Attack Mechanics:** Roll determines effect. Defensive cards may block.  
- **Multiple Copies:** All cards can be duplicated; each functions independently.
