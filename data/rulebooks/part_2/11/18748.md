### 1. Lore & Objective
Unhappy King Charles! simulates the English Civil War between 1642 and 1645, with one player controlling the Royalists (supporters of King Charles I) and the other the Parliamentarians. The goal is to gain and maintain political and military control of England and Wales by recruiting forces, conducting campaigns, capturing fortresses, and securing economic infrastructure. Victory is achieved either through an automatic condition, a power base check during the game, or by earning sufficient Victory Points at the end.

- Brigade counters (Royalist, Parliament, Covenanter, Lorrainer, Irish) with Combat Values (1 = Militia, 2 = Veteran)
- General counters (Field and Regional) and Local Notable counters
- Political Control (PC) markers (Parliament orange, Royalist blue)
- Siege, Blockade & Siege, Bombardment, and other status markers

   - Set Turn Marker to Turn 1.  
   - Place arriving Generals on Turn Record Track.  
   - Sort Brigades by Region, Militia on top.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each of 11 turns follows this sequence:

1. **Housekeeping Phase**  
   - Move Generals from Unemployed Box to Reinforcements Box.  
   - Each player places one PC marker in a neutral Area adjacent to friendly PC, not adjacent to enemy units.  
   - Draw Naval Chit if turn is Late 1642, 1643, 1644, or 1645.

2. **Political Control Phase** (not Turn 1)  
   - Place PC markers in all non-Fortress Areas occupied by friendly Armies or Local Notables.  
   - Remove Isolated PC markers (cannot trace chain to supply fortress, Army, or Local Notable).

3. **Recruitment Phase**  
   - Parliament places Recruited Brigades first, then Royalist.  
   - Number per turn from Turn Track.  
   - Optionally place Blockade & Siege Markers.

4. **Draw Strategy Cards Phase** (not Turn 1)  
   - Recover Core Cards.  
   - Deal 4 cards each from Draw Deck (Royalist first).  
   - Hand = 6+ cards (4 drawn + 2 Core + Ace-in-the-Hole).

5. **Campaign Phase**  
   - Alternate playing/discarding cards until both pass.  
   - Minimum 6 plays per player (unless out of cards or holding Mandatory).  
   - Royalist chooses first player until New Model Army card is played, then Parliament chooses.

6. **Blockade Phase**  
   - Armies with Blockade & Siege Marker may Bombard without card.

7. **Desertion and Supply Attrition Phase**  
   - Apply Desertion (per Turn Track) using priority categories.  
   - Apply Supply Attrition: lose 1 Brigade from each Area with 5+ Brigades.

8. **Power Base Phase**  
   - Check if either player controls fewer Areas than required for turn. If so, they lose.

9. **Turn End Phase**  
   - Recover Core Cards.  
   - Discard Recruitment Cards.  
   - Advance Turn Marker.  
   - Game ends if:  
     - Automatic Victory (e.g., King Charles surrenders)  
     - Power Base failure  
     - End of Winter 1645 → final Victory Point count

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Recruitment**:  
  - **Phase**: Each turn, place Brigades in Recruitment Areas or with Local Notables. Max one per Region. Militia before Veterans (except Powicke Bridge: Royalist may recruit Veteran in first two turns).  
  - **Card Play**: Once per turn, play Operations Card to Recruit 2 Brigades or discard Event Card to Recruit 1.  
    - **Royalist (Grandee Card)**: Brigades to non-Subordinated Regional General or Local Notable. Must match Region. Only one per General. Can place Regional Generals.  
    - **Parliament (Assessment Card)**: Place Brigades as in Recruitment Phase, but may place multiple in same Region (not same Area). Can bring in any Generals.

- **Movement & Activation**:  
  - Use Operations Cards to Activate Generals (value ≥ Strategy Rating).  
  - Major Armies (5+ Brigades) require 3-value or Campaign Card.  
  - Movement Points based on Army size: 4 (1–2 Brigades), 3 (3 Brigades), 2 (4+ Brigades).  
  - Cost: Road = 1 MP, Mountain/Maritime = 2 MP.

- **Battles**:  
  - Triggered by movement into enemy Area or Interception.  
  - Attacker rolls 1d6 + Combat Value + Battle Rating + Tactics Card.  
  - Defender same. Compare totals:  
    - Draw (±1): each loses 1 Brigade (Veteran first)  
    - Indecisive (2–4): loser loses 1 Militia  
    - Major (5+): loser loses 2 Brigades (Militia first)  
  - Decisive Victory if Major + Decisive Combat Card → lose 2 Veterans.  
  - Winner draws cards: Major = 1, Decisive = 2.

- **Fortresses & Sieges**:  
  - Besieging Army must have ≥ (Fortress Class + Garrison size).  
  - Bombardment: 1d6 + modifiers. Accumulate to meet Surrender Value.  
  - Assault: possible after Bombardment ≥5, or Immediate Assault by specific Generals.  
  - Surrender: garrison Disperses (50%) or eliminated (50%). Local Notables eliminated permanently.

- **Desertion**:  
  - Apply number from Turn Track. Remove Brigades in order:  
    1. Regional Generals outside home Region  
    2. Armies >3 Brigades  
    3. Armies adjacent to enemy  
    4. Armies in Area with enemy PC  
    5. Any Area with friendly Brigades (only time unled suffer)  
  - Cycle until requirement met. Lorrainers, Irish (if ≤5 total), Covenanters (≤5 total) may be used if necessary.

- **Naval Rules**:  
  - Draw chit in Late Years. Affects Recruitment and Siege Bombardment.  
  - Positive = Parliament advantage, Negative = Royalist advantage.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Automatic Victory**:  
  - Parliament wins if King Charles Surrenders (Battle, Siege, or lone).  
  - Royalist wins if controls London and 3 Regions for two consecutive turns.

- **Power Base Victory**:  
  - Check each turn: if player controls fewer Areas than required (e.g., 14 in Late 1642), they lose.

- **Final Victory (Winter 1645)**:  
  - Parliament wins if:  
    (2 × number of controlled Regions) + (number of controlled Economic Infrastructures) ≥ 12  
  - Otherwise, Royalist wins.  
  - **Region Control**: majority of Areas in Region.  
  - **Economic Infrastructures** (9):  
    - Northumbrian Coalfield, Lead Mines, Supplies for the City, Forest of Dean, Wine Trade, Great Wen, Wool Road, Weald, Cornish Tin Mines  
    - Controlled if all Areas have friendly PC and no enemy Brigades.
