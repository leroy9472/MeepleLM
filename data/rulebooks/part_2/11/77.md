## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
This optional rule set enhances *EastFront* (EF) gameplay by allowing players to create **Elite Units** through exceptional combat performance, adding narrative depth and strategic decisions. The core idea is that units which achieve extraordinary results in battle become "Elite," gaining increased combat power and evolving into more advanced unit types. This mirrors historical elite formations like the GrossDeutschland or Guards units.

The objective of the Elite Unit Creation rule is to:
- Reward consistent high performance in combat.
- Add a layer of unit progression and personalization.
- Increase player attachment to key units.
- Introduce meaningful risk/reward decisions about committing Elites.

Note: This is a **house rule**, not official. It is best avoided in *MedFront* or *Spanish Civil War* scenarios due to balance concerns.

### 2. Components  
To implement Elite Unit Creation, you will need:
- Standard *EastFront* game components.
- A **post-it note**, **pen**, and **razor knife** (for modifying unit blocks).
  - Alternative: A side record sheet (not recommended due to confusion risk).
- Optional: Historical or thematic naming for Elite units (e.g., "GrossDeutschland", "PattonForce").

### 3. Setup  
No special setup is required for this rule. Begin play normally. The Elite Unit rule applies **during gameplay** when qualifying combat rolls occur.

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. During combat, when a unit attacks:
   - A **three-step unit** must roll **three 6s**, all of which must **count as valid hits**.
   - A **four-step unit** must roll **four 6s**, all of which must **count as valid hits**.
2. If conditions are met, the unit becomes **Elite**.
3. Mark the unit using a cut piece of post-it note affixed over its block:
   - Modify the unit number or symbol to reflect Elite status.
   - Optionally rename the unit.
4. Apply new capabilities (firepower, movement, cost).
5. Track future evolution: further Elite successes allow progression to higher unit types.
6. If the Elite unit is eliminated, it is **rebuilt only as its original non-Elite type**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Creating an Elite Unit  
- **Requirement**: A unit must roll one **6 per step**, and **all hits must count toward enemy losses**.
  - Example: A 4-step unit rolling four 6s against a 1-step target does **not** become Elite — only one hit counts.
- Only **step-reduction hits** count; excess hits on eliminated units do not qualify.

#### Elite Capabilities  
- An Elite **Infantry** unit gains **Double Fire** (hits on 5–6) both offensively and defensively.
- **Production cost remains unchanged** from original unit type.
- **Only one Elite step may be added per Production phase** (separate from SS restrictions).

#### Unit Progression  
Units evolve through successful Elite performances:
- **Infantry → Mechanized → Tank**
- Each evolution requires another qualifying roll (e.g., 3×6s for 3-step, 4×6s for 4-step).
- **SS Units**: Already considered Elite; they skip to next unit type on Elite qualification (e.g., SS Infantry → SS Mech).

#### Marking Elite Units  
- Use post-it notes to:
  - Cover original unit number with a new designation (e.g., "GD").
  - Cover unit symbol with appropriate new symbol (Infantry → Mech → Tank).
- Post-its do not damage original stickers and are easily removable.

#### Rebuilding Eliminated Elites  
- If an Elite unit is eliminated, it **loses all Elite status**.
- It can only be rebuilt as the **original base unit** (e.g., 34th Infantry).
- Re-earning Elite status requires repeating the process.

#### Units That Cannot Become Elite  
The following unit types **may never become Elite**:
- Paratroops
- Fortress troops
- Static units
- German Siege Artillery
- Soviet Coastal Army
- (Note: US/UK Amphibious units **can** become Elite, even evolving into Amphibious Mech or Tank — though this is extremely rare.)

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- This rule does **not alter victory conditions** of the base game.
- However, Elite units contribute indirectly to victory by:
  - Increasing combat effectiveness.
  - Enabling bolder maneuvers (if preserved).
  - Creating psychological and narrative advantages.
- Eliminating enemy Elites may provide strategic satisfaction but no direct VP benefit under this rule.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
**Q: Can a unit become Elite more than once?**  
A: Yes — each successful Elite roll triggers **progression to the next unit type** (Infantry → Mech → Tank).

**Q: Do excess hits count toward Elite qualification?**  
A: No. Only hits that **result in actual enemy step losses** count. Rolling four 6s against a 1-step unit does **not** qualify.

**Q: Can I use a written log instead of modifying blocks?**  
A: Possible, but **not recommended** — high risk of confusion or cheating.

**Q: Are Elite and SS production limits shared?**  
A: No. They are **separate**. You may build one SS step **and** one Elite step per Production.

**Q: Can Amphibious units become Elite?**  
A: Yes — including evolution into Amphibious Mech or Tank, though this has never been observed in play.

**Q: What happens if an Elite unit drops below 3 steps?**  
A: It retains Elite status. But to evolve further, it must roll 3×6s (at 3 CV) or 4×6s (at 4 CV) — so players often keep Elites at 3 CV for easier progression.
