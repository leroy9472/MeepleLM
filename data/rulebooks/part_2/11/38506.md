## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
America, early 20th century: The "Great Old Ones", ancient demonic entities from another dimension, once imprisoned, are now threatening to break into our world. One such being is trapped in a magical pyramid in R'lyeh beneath the sea. Necron, an evil sorcerer and nemesis of Robert Craven—the powerful Witch of Salem—has opened magical portals in Arkham to free this entity. Players take on the roles of occult scholars aiding Craven. Their mission is to locate and close all portals in Arkham using specific artifacts, while preventing Necron from growing too powerful. Ultimately, one player must travel to R'lyeh to banish the imprisoned Great Old One. The game is won only when the Great Old One is banished and all portals—including the one at Miskatonic University—are closed correctly. If players fail, all lose.

4. Gameplay Flow  
A round proceeds in three phases:  
A. Flip New Creature(s)  
B. Player Actions (in clockwise order)  
C. Draw Event Card  

Repeat until game ends.

A. Flip New Creature(s)  
- Starting player reveals:  
  - 1 card (2 players)  
  - 2 cards (4 players)  
  - Alternate 1 and 2, starting with 1 (3 players)  
- For each card:  
  - If matching creature card is NOT on board:  
    - Place creature on first empty location clockwise from Witch of Salem (first is Sanatorium).  
    - Never place on Miskatonic University.  
    - Necron and Robert Craven are never placed on board.  
    - If all 6 locations occupied, discard card without effect.  
  - If matching creature IS on board:  
    - Creature activates: all players suffer effect listed on card (e.g., discard items, move Necron).  
    - If card shows red arrow above required discards and players cannot fully comply:  
      - Discard all available required items  
      - Move Necron marker to next space showing Necron on track  
    - Discard drawn card; original creature remains on board.  

Special Creature Cards:  
- Necron:  
  - Move Necron marker 1 space per creature on board.  
  - If a Great Old One shadow is at Miskatonic University, move 2 extra spaces.  
  - Shuffle Necron card and all discarded creature cards (including Robert Craven if discarded) back into deck.  
- Robert Craven:  
  - Move all player figures and Witch of Salem to Miskatonic University.  
  - All players retrieve played location cards into hand.  
  - If a GOO shadow is at Miskatonic, no loss roll required.  
  - Discard Robert Craven card and draw a new creature card immediately.

B. Player Actions (Clockwise)  
Each player performs these in order:

1. Play Location Card and Move  
- Play one location card from hand, face up.  
- Move figure to location shown.  
- If playing "Secret Passage":  
  - Move to any location except current one  
  - Lose 1 sanity  
  - Only way to reach R'lyeh  
- If moving to Miskatonic University: retrieve all previously played location cards into hand.

2. Trade with Another Player  
- If another player is at same location:  
  - May give one minor item to them, and/or receive one from them  
  - May trade with only one player per turn  
- Artifacts may never be traded or given.

3. Encounter Creature or Shadow  
- If creature at location (or GOO shadow at Miskatonic):  
  - Roll loss die unless Witch of Salem is at same location  
  - Possible results:  
    - Lose 1 minor item (must lose if you have the type shown)  
    - Lose 1 sanity (if reduced to 0, eliminated)  
    - Move Necron 1 space toward dimensional rift  
- After loss (or if no roll due to Witch), may attempt to defeat creature:  
  - Must possess items listed at top of creature card (2 for creatures, 3 for shadows)  
  - Items are NOT discarded (except Thul Sahuun, which requires discarding an artifact)  
  - Defeated creature: remove from board, place in discard pile  
  - Defeated shadow: return to box

4. Use One Item  
- Use one item from your board; discard it after use.  
- Options:  
  - Magical Glasses: Look at face-down portal tile at your location. Return face down. Cannot tell others. Not usable at Miskatonic.  
  - Necronomicon: Reveal next face-down GOO card (in order: 2, 3, 4, 5, then R'lyeh).  
  - Elixir of Nus: Recover 1 sanity (2 if Witch is at your location). Sanity cannot exceed 6.  
  - Dagger of N'gaa: Defeat creature at your location (or shadow at Miskatonic) if Witch is also present.  
  - Artifact: If you have artifact matching the one shown next to a portal tile, place it on the tile to close the portal.  
    - Warning: Placing an artifact on a Wall tile causes immediate loss.  
    - Miskatonic portal may be closed with any artifact, but only after GOO in R'lyeh is revealed and banishment has begun.  
    - Any artifact can be used (and discarded) to defeat Thul Sahuun.

5. Pay for and Receive One Item  
- Optionally take one item from current location and add to your player board.  
- If carrying max (3 minor items or 1 artifact), may discard one to make space.  
- If item was taken from a space with 1 or 2 symbols above it, pay the cost:  
  - Move Necron 1 or 2 spaces  
  - Lose 1 or 2 sanity  
  - Reveal and resolve top creature card  
  - Reveal and resolve top event card  
- Item taken cannot be used until next turn.  
- If last item taken from location, draw 3 new items from bag and refill spaces.  
- If bag is empty, gather all discarded/used items, return to bag, and refill.

C. Draw an Event Card  
- Last player (before starting player) draws and reveals top event card.  
- Move Witch of Salem figure clockwise a number of spaces equal to number on card. From location 6 (Church), move to 0 (Miskatonic).  
- Witch’s abilities (for players at same location):  
  - Can use Dagger to defeat creature  
  - Elixir recovers 2 sanity  
  - No loss die roll when arriving at creature location  
- Follow event card instruction:  
  - Positive effects (e.g., move Necron back, gain items/sanity, remove creature)  
  - Negative effects (e.g., move Necron forward, lose sanity, spawn shadow, draw creature/event)  
- If event deck exhausted: shuffle all 12 cards, remove 4 at random, place 8 remaining next to last player.

Next Round: Starting player repeats Phase A. Starting player never changes.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Cooperative play: All players win or lose together.  
- Hidden information: Portal states are face down; players using glasses may not reveal what they saw.  
- Shared threats: Creature activations and event effects impact all players.  
- Item economy: Items are limited; trading minor items is essential.  
- Sanity management: Starting at 6, dropping to 0 eliminates a player.  
- Race against time: Necron track has two failure points:  
  - Demon space (if reached before GOO in R'lyeh is revealed → loss)  
  - Dimensional Rift (end of track → loss)  
- Banning the Great Old One:  
  - Requires playing Secret Passage (lose 1 sanity), moving to R'lyeh, and possessing required items (varies by GOO; e.g., Cthulhu needs 3 identical, Dagon needs 3 different).  
  - Banning player stops taking turns, loses 1 sanity per their turn, and is immune to events/creature effects.  
  - If banning player is eliminated, another must take over.  
- GOO Abilities (active when revealed):  
  - Cthulhu: Roll loss die twice when encountering creature/shadow  
  - Dagon: When restocking location, leave first (leftmost) item space empty  
  - Hastur: Witch’s abilities disabled  
  - Nyarlathotep: Losses from die rolls are doubled  
  - Shub-Niggurath: At start of each round, move Necron 1 space forward  
  - Yog-Sothoth: Positive event cards have no effect

6. Scoring & End Game  
End Conditions:  
- Loss:  
  - Necron reaches demon space before GOO in R'lyeh is revealed  
  - Necron reaches dimensional rift (end of track)  
  - All but one player eliminated (0 sanity)  
  - At game end, any portal remains open or an artifact was placed on a Wall tile  
- Win:  
  - GOO in R'lyeh is banished AND all portals are closed correctly  
  - After closing Miskatonic portal, reveal all portal tiles:  
    - All Portals must have correct artifact on them  
    - No artifacts on Wall tiles  
    - If condition met, players win  

Scoring (Optional):  
- Count spaces remaining on Necron track  
- Add total:  
  - Minor items held by all players  
  - Artifacts held by all players  
  - Sanity points of all players  
- Total = score

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can you use an artifact from hand to close a portal?  
  A: No. Only artifacts on your player board may be used.  

- Q: Can you trade while at Miskatonic with a shadow?  
  A: Yes, but you must first roll the loss die (unless Witch is present).  

- Q: What happens if Robert Craven is drawn when no creatures are on board?  
  A: Still resolve: move all to Miskatonic, retrieve location cards, discard card, draw new creature.  

- Q: Can you use Elixir of Nus if you have no sanity loss?  
  A: Yes, to recover up to max 6.  

- Q: If you defeat a creature, does it still count for Necron’s power?  
  A: No. Only creatures currently on board count when Necron card is drawn.  

- Q: Can multiple players attempt to ban the GOO?  
  A: No. Only one player may be in the process of banning at a time.  

- Q: Do you roll for loss when moving to R'lyeh?  
  A: No. You do not roll the loss die when traveling to R'lyeh.  

- Q: Can you use the Dagger to defeat a creature not at your location?  
  A: No. Only if you are at the same location and the Witch is present.
