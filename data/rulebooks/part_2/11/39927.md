## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Last Train to Wensleydale*, players take on the role of railway promoters in the Yorkshire Dales during the 19th century, seeking to build profitable railway lines through challenging terrain. The region is rich in stone and cheese, and passengers wish to travel between towns connected to two major railway companies: the Midland Railway and the North Eastern Railway. However, local landowners often oppose construction, and small operators must rely on influence and second-hand equipment to succeed.

**Objective**: Score the most victory points by transporting passengers and goods (stone and cheese), forming balanced sets, maintaining profitability, and minimizing leftover infrastructure. Victory points are awarded for transported goods/passengers, set bonuses, profit/loss position, and penalized for remaining track links.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **4 turns (4 players)** or **5 turns (3 players)**. Each turn has 10 phases:

1. **Investment Cubes**  
   Each player takes up to 12 investment cubes from stock, adding to any unspent cubes. Max holding: 15 cubes.

2. **Influence Points**  
   Place all 20 influence tokens in the bag. Draw one and place it on each of the 8 Influence Boxes (adding to fixed values shown).

3. **Auction Influence Points**  
   - Bidding order follows Player Order track.
   - Each player may bid in up to 2 boxes.
   - Minimum bid: 3 cubes (top row boxes), 2 cubes (bottom row).
   - Bid by placing investment cubes in a box. Overbid another player by exceeding their bid; return their cubes.
   - Cannot over-bid yourself.
   - Repeat until all players have 2 bids or cannot bid.
   - Resolve auctions in box order (1 to 8). Winner adds all influence points (printed + drawn token) to their total.
   - Update influence tracks, stacking tokens if tied. Top of stack has priority in ties.

4. **Orders of Play**  
   - **Build Track Order**: Determined by Government Influence (white). Highest goes first; ties broken by stack position.
   - **Buy Trains & Move Goods Order**: Determined by Train Influence (brown). Highest goes first; ties broken by stack.

5. **Build Track**  
   - Each player builds **one contiguous chain** of track links. No forking during a single turn.
   - Links connect borders between areas. Only one link per border.
   - Cannot build into or out of **hill areas**.
   - Cannot build into **"The South"** (can only build from it).
   - **First turn**: Must start from a company town (red or green).
   - **Later turns**: May start from any company town or any area connected to your existing network.
   - **Cost (Build Points)**:
     - Lowland–Lowland: 1 build point
     - Any connection involving a valley: 2 build points
   - Pay with investment cubes **first**, then influence points (any type).
   - Additional costs:
     - Building to/from a **company town**: 1 influence point of matching color (red for Midland, green for NER). If town is dual-colored, pay both.
     - Building into an area with **Opposition pieces**: 1 Government (white) influence per piece. Remove pieces after payment.

6. **Buy Trains and Move Goods/Passengers**  
   - Action order follows Train Influence track.
   - On your turn, choose one:
     - **Buy a train**
     - **Move one piece** (goods or passenger)
     - **Pass** (exit phase permanently)
   - Repeat rounds until all players pass.

   **Buying Trains**:
   - Trains are in 3 rows:
     - Top: 3 Train Influence points
     - Middle: 2 points
     - Bottom: 1 point
   - You may buy up to 3 trains total, but only **one per row**.
   - Only one player may own each train.
   - **Exchange rule**: If you lack Train Influence, you may spend **3 influence points or investment cubes (any combination)** to gain 1 Train Influence point. Only usable when purchasing a train.

   **Moving Goods/Passengers**:
   - Place piece in an empty slot on one of your trains.
   - Trains operate on **all** your track networks (not just newly built).
   - **Cheese**:
     - Can be moved if your track enters the area.
     - Cannot move if a **company track** (red/green) also enters the area. Remove such cheese from the board.
   - **Stone**:
     - Can be moved if your track connects to a **non-company town** adjacent to the hill area containing the stone.
     - Cannot move stone to a company town.
     - If only company towns are adjacent, remove stone from the board.
   - **Passengers**:
     - Can be moved if your track enters their area and they can travel via **your continuous track** to a **matching-color company town**.
     - Cannot move a passenger already in a matching-color company town. Remove such pieces.

7. **Profit and Loss**  
   - Calculate:
     - +£2 per stone moved
     - +£1 per cheese, red passenger, green passenger moved
     - –£1 per track link you have on the board
   - Adjust position on Profit and Loss track (range: –13 to +5).
   - Resolve in player order. Stack tokens if tied.
   - Remove all goods/passengers from trains and place in front of you (score pile).
   - Return train pieces to your supply.

8. **Order of Play**  
   - Reorder Player Order track based on **Profit and Loss** position.
   - Highest (or top of stack in case of tie) goes first.

9. **Takeovers**  
   - In Player Order, each player may **once** negotiate a takeover of one contiguous series of their track by Midland or North Eastern Railway.
   - Requirements:
     - Series must be **contiguous** (no forks).
     - First link must connect to a **company town** of the acquiring company.
     - Final link must end in a **major or minor town**.
   - Cost: For each influence point spent, replace **up to 2** of your track links with company track (red or green).
   - After replacement:
     - Remove cheese from areas now connected by company track.
     - Remove stone if only company towns are adjacent.
     - Remove passengers now in their destination town.

10. **End of Turn**  
   - Advance turn marker.
   - If marker is on turn 4 (4 players) or turn 5 (3 players), game ends. Otherwise, start next turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Investment Cubes**: Represent capital. Used to bid in auctions and pay build costs. Max 15 held.
- **Influence Points**: Gained via auction. Used to:
  - Build into company towns (red/green)
  - Overcome landowner opposition (white)
  - Buy trains (brown)
  - Pay for track building (any type, after cubes)
- **Track Building**: Linear chains only per turn. Terrain affects cost. No building in hills or into "The South".
- **Train Acquisition**: Limited by row ownership and influence. Flexible conversion rule allows spending cubes/other influence to buy trains.
- **Goods Movement**:
  - Cheese: Simple access, blocked by company tracks.
  - Stone: Requires adjacent non-company town.
  - Passengers: Require path to matching destination.
- **Takeovers**: Strategic removal of unprofitable track. Frees influence and cleans board.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
At end of final turn:
- **+1 VP** per goods/passenger moved (in front of you)
- **+2 VP** per **set** (1 stone, 1 cheese, 1 red passenger, 1 green passenger)
- **± VP** equal to Profit and Loss track value (e.g., +£3 = +3 VP, –£2 = –2 VP)
- **–1 VP** per track link still on board

**Winner**: Highest VP total.  
**Tiebreaker**: Higher position on Profit and Loss track.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build over a hill?**  
  No. Cannot build into or out of hill areas.

- **Can I fork my track?**  
  Not in a single turn. But you can create forks over multiple turns by branching from existing track.

  No. You can only build **from** "The South".

- **Can I build two links between the same areas?**  
  No. Only one link per border.

- **What if I run out of investment cubes?**  
  Take what’s available. Max you can hold is 15.

  No. Must spend cubes first.

- **Can I take over part of a forked network?**  
  Yes, but only one **contiguous, non-forked** series per turn.

  Yes. If you build to/from it, pay **both** MR and NER influence.

  Yes. Trains operate on all your track.

- **What happens to goods/passengers that become unmovable?**  
  Remove them from the board (e.g., passenger in matching company town, stone with only company towns adjacent).
