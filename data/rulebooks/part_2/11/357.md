## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
- The objective is to be the first player to move their marker to space #21 (the "X") on the outside track.  
- Players advance by earning points during their turns based on dice rolls and positioning on the Scoring Track.

2. Components  
- Two six-sided dice (assumed; standard for dice-based gameplay)  
- Player markers  
- Scoring Track (a linear track with numbered spaces where dice are placed)  
- Outside track (numbered spaces 1–21, with space 21 marked as "X")

3. Setup  
- Each player places their marker at the starting position (space #1) on the outside track.  
- The Scoring Track is initially empty.  
- Players determine turn order (method not specified; assumed to be agreed upon or randomized).

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. At the start of a turn:  
   - If the player’s dice are still on the Scoring Track from a previous turn, they immediately earn points equal to the value of the space their dice occupy.  
2. The player rolls both dice.  
3. After each roll:  
   - The player may choose to stop and place their dice on the Scoring Track, or reroll.  
   - If they reroll and roll an X, their turn ends immediately with no points scored and dice not placed.  
4. If the player chooses to place their dice:  
   - They may place them on any unoccupied space on the Scoring Track.  
   - All dice on higher-numbered spaces with values equal to or lower than the placed result are immediately removed.  
5. The player advances their marker on the outside track by the total points earned.  
6. Play passes to the next player.

5. Core Mechanics  
- Dice Reading: Always read the higher number first. For example:  
  - 6 and 7 → 76  
  - 1 and 4 → 41  
- Doubles: Rolling doubles (1,1; 2,2; 3,3) immediately grants 1, 2, or 3 points respectively, regardless of placement.  
- X Result:  
  - On the first roll, X counts as 0. Example: 7 and X → 70.  
  - On a reroll, rolling an X ends the turn immediately with no points or placement.  
- Scoring Track Placement:  
  - Players may place dice on any unoccupied space.  
  - Placing dice removes all dice on higher-numbered spaces that have values ≤ the placed value.  
  - Dice on lower-numbered spaces or with higher values are unaffected.  
- Carryover: Dice left on the Scoring Track remain there and score their space value at the start of the player’s next turn.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Players earn points in two ways:  
  - Immediate points from rolling doubles (1–3).  
  - Points from the Scoring Track space where their dice are placed (or remained from a prior turn).  
- After scoring, the player advances their marker forward on the outside track by the total points earned.  
- The game ends immediately when any player reaches or exceeds space #21.  
- The first player to land exactly on space #21 wins. (Note: Rules do not specify overage handling; assumed to require exact count.)

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: What happens if all spaces on the Scoring Track are occupied?  
  A: Not specified. Assumed that player must reroll or risk ending turn on X.  
- Q: Can you place dice on the 0 space?  
  A: Yes. Multiple dice are allowed in the 0 space.  
- Q: Do doubles trigger removal of other dice on the Scoring Track?  
  A: No. Doubles grant immediate points but do not involve placement, so no removal occurs.  
- Q: Can you reroll more than once?  
  A: Yes, until you either place your dice or roll an X (which ends your turn).  
- Q: What if my dice are on the Scoring Track and I roll an X on my first roll?  
  A: You still earn the points from the Scoring Track at the start of your turn, then roll. Rolling X on first roll counts as 0 (e.g., 5 and X → 50), and you may choose to place or reroll.
