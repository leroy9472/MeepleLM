# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
Gaining Favors is an unofficial expansion for Revolution: The Dutch Revolt 1568–1648, set during the Eighty Years' War. Players represent factions vying for control of the Spanish Netherlands. The core objective remains unchanged from the base game: earn the most victory points by the end of the fifth game turn. This expansion introduces mechanisms for influencing the Staten-Generaal and regional powers through province-based favors, new support boxes, and favor cards to enhance negotiation and strategic depth.

## 2. Components
- **Expansion Game Board**: Features the Seven United Provinces and Southern Lands, with three new Support Boxes: Elisabeth's Warchest, VOC, and The Iron Duke.
- **Favor Cards**: Four per faction (Habsburgs, Burgers, Realfermo—likely a typo for Reformers).
- **Gaining Favors Overview**: A reference sheet listing all favors by province.
- **Rulebook**: Explains setup, phases, and mechanics specific to the expansion.
- **Note**: No new playing pieces are included. Factions start with 46 units instead of 40.

## 3. Setup
- Set up the base game as usual.
- Print and place the expansion board.
- Each faction starts with 46 resource pieces (instead of 40). The initial number of armies (6) remains unchanged.
- The game is designed for 2 or 4 players. For 3 players, one player controls two factions (Burghers & Reformers), and two players control one each (Catholics & Habsburgs).
- The Nobility faction is not used.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### New Phase: Gaining Favors
- Occurs after Support Movement and before Maintaining Armies.
- Players, in game turn order, may gain one favor per turn.
- To gain a favor:
  1. Pay the one-time "bribe" fee for the province (returned to supply).
  2. Choose one of the two favors offered by that province.
  3. Place a piece on the province's image on the expansion board as a reminder.
  4. Pay any additional costs listed in bold (e.g., fl. 1, fl. 2).
  5. Execute the favor immediately, unless marked with an asterisk (*), meaning it takes effect later.

### Limits on Favors
- **2-player and 4-player team games**: Each side (Catholic or Protestant) may gain up to two favors per province.
- **4-player individual games**: Each faction may gain up to two favors per province.
- The one-time bribe is per faction or team. Once paid, it covers both favors from that province for that faction/team.

### New Support Boxes
- **Elisabeth's Warchest**: Burghers or Reformers place pieces here. When fully funded, the faction can defeat up to two enemy armies in coastal regions (Flanders, Zeeland, Holland, Friesland). Pieces then return to supply.
- **VOC**: Burghers place pieces here as investments. During the End Phase, if the Burghers' score increased by at least 0.5, they receive 1 coin per piece on the box. If the score decreased, pieces return to supply. No payout if score unchanged.
- **The Iron Duke**: Catholics place pieces here. It has three stages:
  - **Stage 1 (3 pieces)**: Remove one enemy unit from an enemy-occupied province.
  - **Stage 2 (6 pieces)**: Move one city's status marker two spaces right, or two cities' markers one space each.
  - **Stage 3 (9 pieces)**: Place an army from supply on a city in Holland, Flanders, Maastricht, or Utrecht to begin a siege. The army returns to its Command Block after resolving sieges.

### Favor Cards
- Four per faction. Can be given to another player at any time (except during the End Phase).
- **Card A**: "At any moment you see fit, take fl. 2 from my treasury." (If only fl. 1 available, take that and card is returned.)
- **Card B**: "Take the taxes for one of my cities." (Playable only during Tax Raising; recipient chooses tax rate 1–3.)
- **Card C**: "At the end of a game turn, decide my position in the turn order." (Forces the owner to be last; if multiple, highest scorer decides first.)
- **Card D**: "Consider your contributions officially recognized. I offer 0.5 points from my score." (Playable only during Status Phase.)

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- The game ends after the fifth game turn.
- The player whose faction has the most victory points wins. In case of a tie, all tied players win.
- Victory points are recalculated each turn from zero, based on:
  - 1 point per city card.
  - 1 or 0.5 points per province card (as noted).
  - Faction-specific objectives (e.g., Catholics for bishoprics, Burghers for trade towns).

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a favor be used if its condition cannot be met?** No. For example, Hay Ship requires an army in Gelderland.
- **Can a player use a favor that has an asterisk (*) after its title later in the turn?** Yes. The favor takes effect in its relevant phase (e.g., Power Besiege* triggers at the end of a siege).
- **Can pieces be recovered from the expansion board?** No. Pieces used to claim favors are permanently removed from the player's supply.
- **Can the VOC investment be converted to coins?** Yes, during Support Movement in a later turn, if the pieces remain on the box.
- **Can The Iron Duke stages be partially paid?** Yes. If a player has more pieces than needed for a stage, they pay only the required amount and move the rest to the next stage.
