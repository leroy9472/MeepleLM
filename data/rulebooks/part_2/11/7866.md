## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   In *10 Days in the USA*, players plan a 10-day cross-country journey across the United States. The goal is to be the first to complete a continuous 10-day journey where each day connects to the next, starting with Day 1 and ending with Day 10. The journey must follow specific connection rules based on geography and transportation types.

2. **Components**  
   - Tiles representing U.S. states, each colored to indicate region  
   - Airplane tiles  
   - Automobile tiles  
   - Tile holders (1 per player, with 10 slots)  
   - Draw pile and discard piles (3)

3. **Setup**  
   1. Each player fills their tile holder by drawing one tile at a time and placing it into any empty day slot (Day 1 through Day 10), without taking turns.  
   2. Tiles must remain in the slot where first placed unless replaced during gameplay.  
   3. Tile holders must be shielded from view of other players.  
   4. Remaining tiles are placed face down to form a draw pile.  
   5. The top three tiles of the draw pile are revealed and placed face up to form three discard piles.  
   6. Choose a starting player. Play proceeds clockwise.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   On a player’s turn:
   1. **Draw a Tile**: Choose either:
      - The top tile from the draw pile, or  
      - The top tile from any one of the three discard piles.  
      - If the draw pile is empty, shuffle all non-top tiles from the discard piles to form a new draw pile (keep top tiles visible).
   2. **Place the Tile**:
      - Option A: Replace any one tile in your tile holder with the drawn tile. The replaced tile is discarded face up onto any discard pile.  
      - Option B: Discard the drawn tile face up onto any discard pile (no tile in holder is changed).  
      - If a player takes the last tile from a discard pile, the tile they discard (either replaced or drawn) must refill that discard pile.  
   - After this, the turn ends.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Tile Placement**: Tiles may be placed in any order during setup. During gameplay, only replacements are allowed—no reordering.  
   - **Making Connections**:
     - **By Foot**: Two adjacent state tiles must represent bordering states. They must be placed side-by-side in the tile holder.  
     - **By Automobile**: An automobile tile must be placed between two state tiles that are not directly bordering but share a common bordering state. The automobile connects the two states via the third (implied) state.  
     - **By Airplane**: An airplane tile must be placed between two state tiles of the same color (same region). The airplane tile must also match that color.  
   - **Alaska and Hawaii**:
     - Can only be connected via airplane.  
     - Airplane departing from a state to Alaska or Hawaii must match the color of the origin state.  
     - Airplane returning from Alaska or Hawaii must match the color of the destination state.  
     - Any color airplane may connect Alaska and Hawaii directly.  
   - **Special Rules**:
     - Diagonal connections at the Four Corners (CO, NM, AZ, UT) are invalid. Only horizontal/vertical connections allowed.  
     - Michigan’s Upper and Lower Peninsulas are treated as one state; it can connect to both Ohio and Wisconsin.  
     - Automobile travel between Maine and New Hampshire is impossible—no third state borders both.

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - The game ends immediately when a player completes a valid 10-day journey.  
   - A **completed journey** must:
     - Start with a State Tile (Day 1)  
     - End with a State Tile (Day 10)  
     - Have each day connected to the next day in sequence (Day 1 → Day 2 → ... → Day 10)  
     - Follow all connection rules (foot, automobile, airplane)  
     - Transportation tiles adjacent to each other (e.g., airplane next to automobile) do **not** form a connection  
   - The first player to complete such a journey **wins immediately** upon completing their turn.

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Q: Can I move tiles around in my holder?**  
     A: No. Once placed during setup, tiles can only be replaced—not moved.  
   - **Q: Can I win without using airplane or automobile tiles?**  
     A: Yes. These are optional. A journey using only foot connections is valid.  
   - **Q: What if I draw a tile and don’t want to use it?**  
     A: You may discard it to any discard pile. You are not required to replace a tile.  
   - **Q: What happens when the draw pile runs out?**  
     A: Shuffle all non-top tiles from the three discard piles to form a new draw pile. The top tile of each discard pile remains in place.  
   - **Q: Can two transportation tiles be adjacent and still form a connection?**  
     A: No. Connections only form between state tiles via proper transportation tiles. Two transportation tiles next to each other break the chain.  
   - **Q: Can I connect through a state not in my tile holder?**  
     A: Yes. Automobile connections rely on real-world geography, not on having the third state in your hand.
