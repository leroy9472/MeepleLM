## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Stratego Factions is a modern reimagining of the classic battlefield strategy game, introducing asymmetrical factions with unique abilities and mechanics. Each faction represents a distinct playstyle and thematic identity, such as dragons, knights, planeswalkers, or psychics. The objective remains consistent across all factions: **capture the opponent’s Flag by engaging it with one of your units**.

### 2. Components  
- Game board (10×10 grid)  
- Units (numbered pieces 2–10, Spy, Bomb, Flag)  
- Faction-specific rule cards (optional for reference)  

### 3. Setup  
1. Each player chooses a faction **secretly** before setup.  
2. After both players have chosen, factions are **revealed immediately**.  
3. Players arrange their 40 pieces on their respective home rows (first four ranks) in any configuration they choose.  
4. The Flag may be placed anywhere, including on front lines.  
5. Bombs must be placed on non-Flag squares and can block movement like terrain.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn, a player may take **one action**, which is either:  
- A **move** (including multi-space movement where allowed), or  
- Use of a **special ability** (if available).  

**Engagement Rules:**  
- When two or more pieces occupy the same square, they are **engaged**.  
- At the start of an engagement, **all involved pieces are revealed**.  
- Damage is calculated simultaneously unless otherwise specified.  
- If a unit receives **damage ≥ its strength**, it is **removed**.  
- **Bombs and Spies** are removed if they take **any damage**.  
- **Flags** are not removed by damage but end the game if engaged.  

**Movement & Engagement Specifics:**  
- **2s** may move any number of squares in any direction (not necessarily straight).  
- **3s** automatically **diffuse Bombs** when engaging (i.e., survive bomb engagement).  
- **Spies** win an engagement **only if attacking**; otherwise, they lose.  
- The game ends immediately when **any unit engages the enemy Flag**.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### General Rules  
- **Damage does not carry over between turns.**  
- Each numbered unit deals **damage equal to its strength** (not necessarily its rank).  
- **Special abilities** only require revealing the activating piece and **do not imply engagement**.  
- Abilities with “n moves away” can target through walls, water, or pieces.  

#### Faction Rules  

##### Dragons  
- **5 (Fire-breathing):** Deal 3 damage to a target up to 2 moves away (not adjacent to water). All enemy units adjacent/diagonal to target take 2 damage.  
- **6 (Fire Blast):** Remove one of your Bombs and an adjacent or diagonal enemy unit.  
- **Bomb (B):** Loses all engagements.  
- **Flag (F):** Permanently revealed at the start.  
- **Global:** All units have **–1 strength** when adjacent to water.  

##### Knights  
- **5 (Detonate):** If on the same square as a **launched bomb**, remove all adjacent/diagonal enemy units (except Flags). Repeat if another launched bomb is removed.  
- **6 (Charge):** Move in a straight line until adjacent/diagonal to an enemy. Engage one. If moved >1 square, gain **+1 strength** in engagement.  
- **Bomb (B):** Loses all engagements. Can be **launched**:  
  - **Launch ability:** Permanently reveal and move Bomb 3–5 squares forward. It becomes impassable terrain but cannot be engaged and is immune to effects. Units may move through its original square.  
- **Global:** All units may move and attack **diagonally**.  

##### Planeswalkers  
- **5 (Phase Jump):** Move a unit two spaces in one direction through a piece (no engagement), then **push** that piece to the original square.  
- **6 (Planeswalk):** Move 1 space in any direction, including diagonally or over water.  
- **10:** May move any number of spaces in one direction. If movement results in engagement, **loses 0.5 strength** in that engagement.  
- **Spy (S):** Loses all engagements.  
  - **Disintegrate (ability):** If the Spy has **not moved this game**, remove an adjacent or diagonal enemy piece.  
- **Global:** No additional.  

##### Psychics  
- **9 & 10 (Telekinesis):** Move an adjacent or diagonal piece (ally or enemy) to any other adjacent or diagonal square.  
  - If used on an **enemy**, player must **correctly identify its rank**.  
  - If wrong, ability fails and **turn ends immediately**.  
- **Global (Mind-Reading):** Choose an adjacent or diagonal enemy unit to **reveal** (without revealing your own).  
  - If the revealed unit is **9 or 10**, the enemy **Flag is also revealed**.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends **immediately** when **any unit engages the enemy Flag** — the **player whose unit engaged the Flag wins**.  
- There is **no scoring system**; victory is binary.  
- No stalemate rules are specified. If both players are unable to act, standard engagement rules apply.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use a special ability and move in the same turn?**  
  No. Each turn allows **one action**: move **or** ability.  

- **What happens when a Bomb engages a unit?**  
  Bomb and engaging unit are **both removed**, unless the engaging unit is a **3**, which **diffuses** the bomb and survives.  

- **Can I launch a Knight’s Bomb onto water or occupied square?**  
  No. Launch must be to a valid empty square 3–5 spaces forward.  

- **Does Mind-Reading reveal the Flag if a 9 or 10 is adjacent?**  
  Yes. If the **targeted enemy unit is rank 9 or 10**, the **enemy Flag is revealed**.  

- **Can Phase Jump push a unit into a Bomb?**  
  Yes. If the pushed unit lands on a Bomb, engagement occurs and both are removed (unless unit is a 3).
