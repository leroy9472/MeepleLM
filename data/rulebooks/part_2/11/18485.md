### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game alternates between **Stock Rounds (SR)** and **Operating Rounds (OR)** until endgame conditions are met.

#### Stock Round (SR)  
Players act as investors. Turn order is clockwise, continuing until all players pass in order.  
- **Priority**: Starts with the player to the left of the last to take an action.  
- **Actions (in any order, any number)**:  
  1. **Sell Certificates**  
     - Any number of shares (including private companies) may be sold to the Open Market at current Market Value.  
     - Market Value drops **↓1 per 10% share sold** (except 5% NdM shares, which do not affect price).  
     - Open Market limit: 5 shares per company; cannot sell President’s Certificate, Private, or Minor Co. shares.  
     - 5% NdM shares: sell for **½ Market Value** (rounded up).  
     - Cannot sell shares of a company whose certificates you sold earlier in the same SR.  
     - First SR: No selling allowed.  
  2. **Buy/Sell Private Companies**  
     - Players may trade private companies at any agreed price.  
     - From Phase 3 onward, major companies may buy private companies for ½ to 1½× face value upon purchasing their first 3-train.  
  3. **Buy Certificate**  
     - Buy one certificate from the IPO or Open Market, paying the Bank.  
     - IPO: Pay Par price.  
     - Open Market: Pay current Stock Price.  
     - Cannot buy a certificate of a company whose shares you sold this SR.  
     - Yellow stocks (e.g., NdM) have **no certificate limit**.  
- **Floatation**: A company floats when **50% of its shares are sold** (IPO shares only; exchange shares count only after trade-in). Upon floating:  
  - Receive Charter, Stations, and $10 × Par in Treasury.  
  - Company is fully capitalized.  
- **Sold-Out Company**: If all shares are sold, Market Value increases ↑1 space.  

#### Operating Round (OR)  
Players act as Presidents of floated companies, operating in order:

- **Minor Companies** operate first (A → B → C):  
  - Lay 1 yellow tile.  
  - Must run their 2-train.  
  - Revenue split 50/50 between company and owner.  
- **Private Companies**: Operate and earn revenue.  
- **Major Companies**: Take actions in order:

     - **Train Range**: Counts cities and terminal off-map areas; towns (dots) do not count against range.

     - Must run if possible.  
  6. **Pay/Withhold Dividends**:

       - If unaffordable: Sell shares (↓1 per 10% sold), but President cannot change.  
       - If still unaffordable: **Bankruptcy** (immediate game end).  
     - Excess trains: Discard to Open Market.  
- **Minor Railroad Closure**: After fifth 3-train is sold (Phase 3.5), minors close:  
  - Tokens removed.  
  - Treasury transferred to associated major company.

- **Train Obsolescence**:  
  - 4-trains become obsolete after second 6-train is bought.  
  - Obsolete 4-trains get **one final run**, then rust.  
- **Par Values**: 60, 70, 75, 80, 90. Set when President buys Pres. Cert.
