## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Angola! simulates a critical phase of the Angolan Civil War from July 1975 to April 1976. The conflict centers on four factions—FAPLA, MPLA, UNITA, and FNLA—divided into two alliances: the Soviet-backed FAPLA/MPLA and the Western-backed UNITA/FNLA. Victory hinges on capturing towns and cities, winning propaganda victories, and controlling strategic locations. The game ends after ten turns, or earlier if a decisive victory is achieved. Only an alliance can win; individual factions cannot.

2. Components  
- Game map (34 × 22 inches) depicting Angola and adjacent regions (Zaire, South-West Africa)  
- 2 sheets of 5/8" cardboard counters (Minor Units, Equipment, Markers)  
- 1 sheet of 1" cardboard counters (Major Units, Infantry Brigades)  
- 65 Operations Cards (per faction: Column, Command, 5th Column, Blank)  
- 4 player aid cards (one per faction)  
- Victory Tokens (5 per faction)  
- Control Markers (23 total, one for each town/city except Cabinda)  
- Equipment counters: Mines, Minefields, Anti-Aircraft Missiles, Anti-Tank Missiles  
- Column markers (5 per faction)  
- First Player Marker, Turn Marker, Victory Track Markers  
- Reinforcement Card deck (65 cards)  
- Six-sided die  

3. Setup  
- Players sit according to faction: FAPLA (west), FNLA (north), MPLA (east), UNITA (south).  
- Each player:  
  - Places Units per faction deployment rules (e.g., FAPLA: 5 infantry + 1 armored car in Luanda).  
  - Sets aside 4 Major Units and 5 Victory Tokens off-map.  
  - Receives 5 Column markers.  
- Control Markers:  
  - Each faction places initial Control Markers off-map (FAPLA: Luanda; FNLA: Maquela do Zombo, Santo Antônio; MPLA: Luso; UNITA: Pereira de Eça).  
  - Remaining 18 Control Markers are randomly drawn: FAPLA & UNITA: 4 each; MPLA & FNLA: 5 each.  
  - 5 leftover Control Markers placed face-up on map (uncontrolled towns/cities).  
- Off-map Units: Players secretly place undeployed infantry Units on their off-map Control Markers (max 4 per marker).  
- Form Columns: Players create Columns using Column markers on map or off-map Units.  
- Deploy off-map Forces: Move all off-map Units to their corresponding towns/cities.  
- Place Victory Track Markers at "20", Turn Marker at "Turn 1", First Player Marker beside chart.  
- Shuffle Reinforcement Card deck.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has three phases:  
1. Planning Phase  
   a) Add new Operations Cards to deck (Turns 3–6).  
   b) Create Operations Pack: Players secretly select number of cards based on Turn Record Track (e.g., 4 cards in Turn 1). Must include Blank Cards.  
   c) Determine First Player: Roll die. Turn 1: 1–4 = chart result; 5–6 = re-roll. Later turns: 1–4 = chart; 5–6 = player to left goes first.  

2. Operations Phase  
   - Players take turns clockwise, flipping top card of Operations Pack:  
     - Blank: No action.  
     - Column Card: Move designated Column; combat if entering enemy region.  
     - Command Card: Reorganize Columns (swap or reassign markers) between unmoved forces.  
     - 5th Column Card: Move non-Column Force; cannot enter enemy region.  
   - Movement rules apply (see 7). Combat resolves immediately after movement.

3. End Phase  
   a) Victory Determination:  
      - Check for decisive victory (Victory Tokens ≥ Victory Track position).  
      - If turn 10, check end-game victory (closer to 10 on track).  
      - Otherwise, total Victory Tokens per alliance; winner moves marker down track.  
   b) Reorganization: Form Infantry Brigades (3 infantry → 1 brigade); reorganize Columns.  
   c) Direct Foreign Aid: Losing alliance checks Direct Foreign Aid Table; receive Minor/Major Units.  
   d) Recruitment: Set and variable recruitment (based on controlled cities/towns).  
   e) Covert Foreign Aid: Secret bids for Reinforcement Cards; draw cards, deploy aid.  
   f) Clean Up: Return airgroups; return Victory Tokens; flip Control Markers face up; advance Turn Marker.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Forces & Columns**: A Force is any stack of Units. Only Columns can attack. Columns hide Unit composition.  
- **Movement**:  
  - Road: Up to 6 regions if all connected by road.  
  - Clear terrain: Up to 3 regions.  
  - Combo (road or clear): Up to 3 regions.  
  - Jungle: Must roll ≥ jungle rating (1–3); failure adds +1 Jungle Marker (cumulative).  
  - Tanks/Major artillery: Can only move through clear or road; destroyed if forced into jungle/savannah/hills.  
- **Combat Procedure** (strict order):  
  1. Automatic Victory: Attacker has 6× strength, no defending Column → defender eliminated.  
  2. Commit Airgroups: Reveal number committed.  
  3. Reveal Units: All combat Units revealed.  
  4. Air-to-Air Combat: Resolve using Hit Table.  
  5. Air Strikes: Surviving airgroups (max 2) strike; anti-aircraft missiles optional.  
  6. Artillery Fire: Max one per side; Attacker first; suppressed after firing.  
  7. Minefields: Defender reveals; Attacker uses engineer to remove (one suppressed) or rolls 1d6 per armored unit (1 = destroyed).  
  8. Anti-Tank Missiles: Fire against armored units; 2d6 per missile; ignore one suppression if tanks present.  
  9. Combat Resolution:  
     a) Odds: Attacker vs. Defender strength, rounded down (1-4 to 6-1).  
     b) Net Combat Dice Bonus: (Supporting Regions + Unit Combat Dice Points) difference (max +5).  
     c) Roll Combat Dice: Terrain determines dice count. Defender gets +1 die for town/city (no assault engineers), escarpment, or minefield.  
     d) Difference adjusts odds via Adjustment Table.  
     e) Result Table determines outcome (e.g., retreat, elimination).  
  10. Straggling: Attacking Column loses 1 Unit (2 if ≥8 Units).  
  11. Transfer Control Markers and Victory Tokens if town/city captured.  
- **Engineers**:  
  - Must remove minefield (one suppressed).  
  - Else, act as assault engineers in towns/cities (negate defender’s +1 die).  
  - Else, fight as strength 1.  
- **Airgroups**: Off-map; committed per combat; after use, go to Air Mission Completed Box until turn end.  
- **Equipment**:  
  - Mines: Can be converted to immobile minefields.  
  - Missiles: One-use; return to pool after firing.  
  - Shared pool; assigned to Forces.  
- **Special Areas**:  
  - Zaire: Only FNLA/UNITA can enter. FLEC Base only accessible by FNLA from Zaire Proper.  
  - South-West Africa: Only UNITA/FNLA can enter.  
  - Cabinda: No Control Marker. Capture triggers Victory Track move for UNITA/FNLA. MPLA defenders convert retreats to “½ eliminated”.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Victory Tokens**:  
  - Town captured: 1 token from owner.  
  - City (non-Luanda): 2 tokens.  
  - Luanda: 3 tokens.  
  - Returned to owners during Clean Up.  
- **Winning a Turn**: Alliance with most Victory Tokens moves marker down track:  
  - 15+ tokens: down 3  
  - 10–14: down 2  
  - 6–9: down 1  
- **Decisive Victory**: At any turn, if alliance controls ≥ Victory Tokens as current track space.  
- **End Game Victory**: After Turn 10, alliance with marker closer to 10 wins. Ties possible.  
- **Propaganda Victory**: Highest bid in Covert Foreign Aid (if unique) moves enemy’s marker down 1.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Column Management**:  
  - Columns formed during setup, after Command Card, or End Phase.  
  - Command Card: Reassign or swap markers only between unmoved forces.  
  - End Phase: Merge Columns or create new ones with off-map markers.  
- **Retreats**:  
  - Attacker retreats to origin region.  
  - Defender chooses adjacent region, not enemy-occupied or attacker’s region.  
  - Penalty: ½ eliminated if retreating to region adjacent to attacker’s region or into retreat zone (empty region adjacent to friendly non-combat units).  
  - Tank/Major artillery destroyed if retreating to non-clear/hills.  
- **Control Markers**:  
  - Face up: Provide recruitment, aid, and port benefits.  
  - Face down: No benefits; flipped face up during Clean Up.  
- **Major Units**:  
  - Eliminated = permanently removed (unless Crisis Table result 1).  
  - Cannot retreat through non-clear terrain.  
- **Infantry Brigades**: 3 infantry → 1 brigade; counts as one Unit; irreversible.  
- **Crisis Table**: Rolled when can’t draw Major Unit for Direct Foreign Aid. Effects: recover eliminated units, withdraw units, reduce reinforcement cards, movement restrictions.
