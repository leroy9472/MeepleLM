## Guilds of London — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Guilds of London is a strategic tile placement and worker placement game set in historical London. Players compete to control guilds and special buildings by placing liverymen (workers), resolving tiles, and earning Victory Points (VPs). The game ends after a set number of rounds, and the player with the most VPs wins. VPs are earned through tile resolutions, second-place rewards, mayoral rewards, and adjacency of controlled tiles.

### 3. Setup  

#### General Setup (3–4 Players):  
1. Place two Guildhall tiles side-by-side, centering the compass rose. Place Compass Rose Token on the icon, pointing North.  
2. Place Church of St Lawrence Jewry to the right of the Guildhall, VP side up.  
3. Shuffle the remaining 4 Special Tiles into the 40 Guild Tiles. Form a face-up stack.  
4. Draw and place:  
   - 1 tile to the left of the Guildhall  
   - 4 tiles above the Guildhall row  
   - 4 tiles below the Guildhall row  
5. Place one $2^{\text{nd}}$ place token face-up on each of the 10 face-up Guild/Special Tiles.  
6. Place Beadle on the lowest-numbered Guild Tile.  
7. Place Scoreboard (3–4P side), Round Marker on space 1.  
8. Place Plantation Tile (agreed orientation) on the ship space.  
9. Players choose colours, take 2 markers each.  
10. Randomly determine Start Player. Place markers on turn order track (1–4).  
11. Shuffle Action Cards, deal 6 to each player. Form draw deck and discard pile.  
12. Place Neutral Liverymen on scoreboard:  
   - 2P: 4  
   - 3P: 6  
   - 4P: 8  
13. Each player places 4 Liverymen on the Guildhall. Rest go to supply.  
14. Shuffle Mayoral Reward Cards, deal 3 to each player. Each keeps 1 (secret), returns 2. Shuffle discard pile, place deck on scoreboard.

#### 2-Player Game Adjustments:  
- Use one Guildhall Tile (2P side up)  
- Remove Gog & Magog from the game  
- Place 4 Special Tiles around Guildhall in a "+"  
- Fill play area to form a 5×5 grid centered on the "+"  
- Place $2^{\text{nd}}$ place tokens normally  
- Flip Scoreboard to 2P side

#### Solo Mode Setup:  
- Set up as 2-player game  
- Only 2 Neutral Liverymen on scoreboard  
- Boris (AI) uses off-board supply; his liverymen start in Guildhall  
- Seed neutral liverymen:  
  - Virginia: 1 neutral on each of 6 lowest-numbered guilds  
  - Ulster: 1 neutral on each of 6 highest-numbered guilds  
- These neutrals increase majority requirement by 1 but do not count toward it  
- Boris receives no cards

### 4. Gameplay Flow  

Each round follows this sequence:

1. **Start New Round**  
   - Advance Round Marker (skip Round 1)  
   - Determine turn order: descending VP, top marker breaks ties  

2. **Player Turns**  
   - In turn order, each player:  
     - May play any number of Action Cards for:  
       - Hire a Liveryman  
       - Move a Liveryman  
       - Use Card’s Special Ability  
     - After actions, discard played cards  
     - Draw:  
       - 4 cards if no actions taken  
       - 2 cards if any actions taken (modified by abilities)  
     - Discard down to hand limit (7, or 8 if Master of University of London)  

3. **End of Round Phase**  
   - Resolve tiles every:  
     - 2P: every 2 rounds  
     - 3–4P: every round  
   - Resolve tiles from top-left to bottom-right, row by row  
   - Skip tiles with coat of arms up (already resolved)  
   - Only resolve if total pieces (liverymen + Beadle) ≥ majority value (top-left number)  

   **Tile Resolution (per tile):**  
   a. **Negotiation**  
      - In current VP order, each player may replace 0+ of their liverymen with neutral liverymen  
      - Replaced liverymen return to Guildhall  
      - If no player liverymen remain, skip tile  
   b. **Voting**  
      - Count liverymen per player  
      - Winner has strict majority (more than all others)  
      - Tie: +1 per orthogonally adjacent Master (own colour)  
      - If tie persists, no winner  
   c. **Rewards**  
      1. Winner:  
         - Takes 1st place reward and resolution bonus  
         - May choose to perform all, part, or none of abilities (left to right)  
      2. Second place:  
         - Player with 2nd most liverymen takes $2^{\text{nd}}$ place token  
         - If tie or no second player, no one gets it; return token to pool  
      3. Cleanup:  
         - Remove all pieces  
         - Flip tile shield-side up  
         - Place winner’s liveryman as **Master**  
         - Return other liverymen to Guildhall  
         - If Beadle was on tile, move to lowest-numbered face-up tile  

   - **Last Tile Resolved?**  
     - If yes and more tiles available: Round Marker jumps to next grey space (trigger Growth Phase)  
     - 2P: If last tile, resolve Plantation once more, then final scoring (even if not final round)  

4. **Growth Phase** (occurs when Round Marker is on grey space)  
   a. **Resolve Plantation Tile**  
      - Negotiation: each player may replace liverymen with neutrals (return to Guildhall)  
      - Voting: highest wins left reward, second highest wins right reward  
      - Tie for first: all tied get right reward, others get nothing  
      - Tie for second: no second reward  
      - Only one player: only left reward  
      - Winners return 1 or 2 liverymen to supply (per icon)  
   b. **Check Game End**  
      - 2P: if Round 10 or no tiles left → Final Scoring  
      - 3–4P: if final round (15/12) → Final Scoring  
      - Else: add tiles (3–4P only)  
   c. **Add New Tiles** (3–4P only)  
      - 3P: 5 tiles, 4P: 6 tiles  
      - Direction based on round:  
        - Round 3: North (above northernmost)  
        - Round 6: East (right of easternmost)  
        - Round 9: South (below southernmost)  
        - Round 12 (3P): West (left of westernmost)  
      - Remaining tiles placed clockwise around perimeter, no gaps  
   d. **Move Beadle** to lowest-numbered face-up Guild Tile  

5. **Final Scoring**  
   - Reveal Mayoral Reward Cards; add bonuses to score  
   - Score 1 VP per pair of orthogonally adjacent Masters (a tile can be in multiple pairs)  
   - Highest VP wins  
   - Tie: player with most Mayoral Reward Cards wins

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Action Cards  
Each card allows one of:  
- **Hire a Liveryman**: Play card → place 1 liveryman from supply to Guildhall (no cost)  
- **Move a Liveryman**: Play card → move 1 liveryman to any tile matching the card’s suit(s)  
  - Destination tile may show multiple suits; any matching suit is valid  
- **Use Special Ability**:  
  - Pay cost (gold = discard cards; other costs = return liverymen)  
  - Use effect (immediate or ongoing until end of turn)  

#### Hand Limit  
- Normal: 7  
- Master of University of London: +1 → 8  

#### Special Tile Effects (when resolved):  
- **Church of St Lawrence Jewry**: Draw 4 cards  
- **Company Hall**: Take 1 or 2 neutral liverymen (if available)  
- **Gog & Magog**: Win all ties while Master of this tile  
- **Lord Mayor's Parade**: Choose a Guild type for this Guild as Master  
- **University of London**: Hand size +1 while Master  

#### Scoring Mechanics  
- **Mayoral Reward Cards**: Secret bonuses scored at end  
- **Adjacency**: 1 VP per pair of orthogonally adjacent Masters  
  - Example: 2 adjacent → 1 VP; 4 in square → 4 VP (4 pairs)  
- **Tiebreaker**: Most Mayoral Reward Cards

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End Conditions  
- **2P**: Round 10 **OR** all tiles resolved (whichever comes first)  
- **3P**: Round 15  
- **4P**: Round 12  
- Growth Phase triggers final scoring if on final grey space  

#### Final Scoring Steps  
1. Remove all liverymen from unresolved tiles (return to box)  
2. Reveal Mayoral Reward Cards; apply bonuses  
3. Score adjacency: 1 VP per adjacent pair of Masters  
4. Total VPs  
5. Winner: highest VP; tie → most Mayoral Reward Cards  

#### Solo Mode End Game  
- Final scoring as normal  
- Boris scores only VPs (no adjacency, no mayoral cards)  
- You win if your score > Boris’s

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: What happens if I exceed hand size during Tile Resolution?**  
A: You do not discard until the discard step of the next round.

**Q: Can a Special Tile count for card effects requiring a suit?**  
A: Only if the resolved side shows the suit. Most Special Tiles do not show suits on shield side.

**Q: Can I use The Guild of Solo Board-gamers promo card?**  
A: Yes. Collect 3 $2^{\text{nd}}$ place tokens → spend them to claim a resolved guild (no master) as your own. Requires liveryman in Guildhall.

**Q: Does Boris place a Master when he wins a tile?**  
A: No. Boris only gains VPs. No Master is placed.

**Q: When does the Beadle move?**  
A: After a tile is resolved (if Beadle was on it), move to lowest-numbered face-up tile. After Growth Phase, always move Beadle.

**Q: What if no tile has a number for the Beadle?**  
A: Remove Beadle; game ends after current round.

**Q: Can I move a Master?**  
A: No. Masters are fixed. Only liverymen can be moved.

**Q: Do neutral liverymen from setup count toward majority?**  
A: No. They increase the required majority by 1 but do not count toward meeting it.

**Q: Can I win a tile with zero liverymen after negotiation?**  
A: No. If no player liverymen remain, skip resolution.

**Q: What if I draw a Mayoral Reward Card and deck is empty?**  
A: Score 5 VP instead.
