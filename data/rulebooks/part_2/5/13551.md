## OLTRE MARE — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players represent competing merchant families navigating the Mediterranean Sea during the height of Venetian trade. The goal is to accumulate the most Ducati by strategically managing cargo, trade, movement, and reputation. Victory is determined through final scoring involving cargo sales, harbor control, prestige, and penalties.

### 2. Components  
- 98 Goods Cards (7 types: jewels, scrolls, silk, salt, pottery, olives, grain)  
- 1 Venice Card  
- 5 Summary Cards (one per player color)  
- 5 Merchant Cards (player identity and prestige tracker)  
- 10 Wooden cubes (5 for Ducat Track, 5 as ships)  
- 1 Game Board (Mediterranean map with harbors and sea routes)  
- 32 Harbor Bonus Markers (6 types, placed face-up on harbors)  
- 40 Prestige Tiles (used to track Prestige Points)  
- 5 Minus Markers (track negative Ducati)  

### 3. Setup  
1. Assemble the board and place it in the center.  
2. Each player chooses a color and takes:  
   - 1 Ship (wooden cube)  
   - 1 Merchant Card  
   - 1 Summary Card (placed on Merchant Card to show Prestige = 0)  
   - 2 Wooden cubes: one for Ducat Track (starting at "11"), one for ship placement  
3. Shuffle Harbor Bonus Markers and place one face-up on each harbor. Return extras to box.  
4. **For 2 players only**: Remove all grain cards from the game.  
5. Shuffle Goods Cards to form the Goods Deck.  
6. **Determine starting harbors**:  
   - Draw cards from the Goods Deck until a card with a harbor name appears.  
   - Assign that card to a player as the first card in their Cargo Stack.  
   - Place player’s ship on the matching harbor.  
   - Discard the harbor marker from that harbor (not used).  
   - Repeat for all players.  
7. Reshuffle the Goods Deck.  
8. Insert the Venice Card approximately in the middle of the deck.  
9. Each player draws 4 cards into their hand.  
10. Choose starting player (e.g., player closest to Venice). That player takes the Start Player Tile.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, phases are executed in strict order:

#### 1. Maritime Power Phase  
- Check the top card of your Cargo Stack: its **Maritime Power icons** (lion symbols) set your hand limit.  
- If you have more cards in hand than this number, discard excess cards face-down to your **Pirate Stack** (you choose which cards).  

#### 2. Trade Phase  
- **Trade freely** with other players: exchange cards and/or Ducati.  
  - Other players **gain 1 Prestige Point** per turn (tracked via Summary Card), regardless of number of trades.  
  - Active player gains **no Prestige**.  
  - Players must truthfully reveal **goods type** on cards, but may lie about icons.  
- **Buy cards** (up to 4 total):  
  - From Goods Deck or own Pirate Stack.  
  - Cost: **3 Ducati each**, unless player has **0 or fewer Ducati** → cost is **4 Ducati each**.  
- You may alternate trading and buying.

#### 3. Main Phase  
- Must play a number of cards equal to the **Load icons** (freight symbols) on the top card of your Cargo Stack.  
- If you lack enough cards, you **cannot begin** this phase — return to Trade Phase to acquire more.  
- Play cards face-up and resolve actions in this order:

##### Ducati Action  
- Total Ducati icons on played cards determines payout:  
  - 1 icon → 1 Ducati  
  - 2 icons → 3 Ducati  
  - 3+ icons → 6 Ducati  

##### Pirate Action  
- Total Pirate icons determines cards drawn from Goods Deck and placed **face-down** on your Pirate Stack:  
  - 1 icon → 1 card  
  - 2 icons → 3 cards  
  - 3+ icons → 6 cards  

##### Market Action  
- Total Market icons determines cards drawn from Goods Deck into your hand:  
  - 1 icon → 1 card  
  - 2 icons → 3 cards  
  - 3+ icons → 6 cards  

##### Sailing Action  
- Must move ship exactly the number of **harbors** equal to total Sailing icons.  
- May not traverse the same sea route twice in one turn.  
- If your ship ends movement in a harbor with a **Harbor Bonus Marker**:  
  - Take it; it becomes your **active marker**.  
  - Previous active markers are turned face-down.  
- If harbor is empty, you lose your active marker.

#### 4. Cargo Phase  
- Place all cards played in Main Phase **face-up** on top of your Cargo Stack, in **any order** you choose.  
- The **top card** now determines:  
  - Hand limit (Maritime Power icons) for next turn  
  - Number of cards to play (Load icons) in next turn  
- You may end your turn with more cards than your new Maritime Power allows — discard happens at start of next turn.

#### New Active Player  
- Turn passes clockwise. The player to the left becomes the new active player.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Harbor Bonus Markers (Active Only)  
Only the **most recently acquired** marker is active. Others are inactive (face-down). Effects:

- **Compass**: Immediately move ship to any harbor. Take its marker (if any) as new active. **Discard Compass** from game. Cannot move to another Compass harbor.  
- **Fight Pirates**: Ignore **Pirate icons** during Main Phase → no cards added to Pirate Stack from Pirate Action.  
- **Good Terms (On Favourable Terms)**: During Trade Phase, bought cards cost: 1st = 1 Ducati, 2nd = 2, 3rd = 3, 4th = 4. Applies to cards from Goods Deck or Pirate Stack.  
- **Local Authority**: At start of turn, gain **(Maritime Power icons − 3)** Ducati. Minimum 0 (e.g., 3 icons → 0 Ducati).  
- **Big Deal**: Add **+1 Ducati icon** to total during Ducati Action (e.g., 2 real icons → count as 3 → gain 6 Ducati).  
- **Plain Sailing**: Gain **1 Ducati** for each **Sailing icon** on played cards during Main Phase.

#### Venice Card & Interim Scoring  
- When the Venice Card is drawn (or is on top of Goods Deck after a turn), trigger **Interim Scoring** immediately.  
- **Prestige Scoring**:  
  - 1st: 6 Ducati  
  - 2nd: 3 Ducati  
  - 3rd: 1 Ducati (even with 0 Prestige)  
  - Ties: all tied players receive full reward for position.  
- **Reset Prestige**: All players return Prestige Tiles to supply (set to 0).  
- **Freight Stack Scoring**:  
  - Each player removes the **topmost group** of same-type goods from their Cargo Stack (e.g., two olives).  
  - Score remaining cards in Cargo Stack **as in final scoring** (grouped sets).  
  - Discard scored cards.  
  - Keep top group as new base of Cargo Stack.  
- **Venice Card is removed** from game.  
- Active player **resumes turn** (if interrupted), or next player begins if turn was complete.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End  
- Game ends when a player draws the **last card** from the Goods Deck.  
- That player finishes their turn.  
- Then, all players complete **one final round** — ending with the player to the **right of the starting player**.  
- During final round, if Goods Deck is exhausted:  
  - Shuffle **discarded cards** (from Pirate Stacks, etc.) into a new Goods Deck.  
  - If this deck is also exhausted, score only up to Prestige in Final Scoring, then reuse freight and pirate stacks as new deck.

#### Final Scoring  
Total Ducati from:

1. **Cargo Sales (Freight Stack)**  
   - Sort stack into **contiguous groups** of same goods (top-down).  
   - Each group scores based on **size and good type** (see table below).  
   - Maximum payout per good type is capped (e.g., 5+ silks = same as 3 silks).  
   - Order in stack is **fixed**; cannot be changed.

   | Good       | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5+ |
   |------------|---|---|---|---|----|
   | Jewels     | 1 | 3 | 6 | – | –  |
   | Scrolls    | 1 | 3 | 6 | 9 | 9  |
   | Silk       | 0 | 3 | 8 | – | 8  |
   | Salt       | 1 | 3 | 6 | – | –  |
   | Pottery    | 1 | 3 | 6 | 9 | 9  |
   | Olives     | 1 | 3 | 6 | 9 | 9  |
   | Grain      | 1 | 3 | 6 | 9 | 9  |

2. **Harbor Bonus Markers**  
   - 1st: 6 Ducati  
   - 2nd: 3 Ducati  
   - 3rd: 1 Ducati (even with 0 markers)  
   - Ties: all tied receive full reward.  
   - **Tiebreaker**: Most *different types* of markers → if still tied, all score equally.

3. **Prestige Points**  
   - Same as Interim Scoring: 6 / 3 / 1 for top 3.  
   - Ties: all receive full reward.

4. **Pirate Stack Penalty**  
   - Lose **1 Ducati** for **each card** in Pirate Stack.

#### Final Victory  
- Highest Ducati total wins.  
- **Tiebreakers**:  
  1. Most cards in **Freight Stack**  
  2. Most **Harbor Bonus Markers**

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I look at my Pirate Stack?** No. Cards are face-down and hidden.  
- **Can I use Harbor Marker effects outside their phase?** No. Effects only apply during relevant phase (e.g., Local Authority at start of turn).  
- **What if I can’t move during Sailing Action?** You must be able to move exactly the required number of harbors. If blocked, you cannot play the cards.  
- **Can I trade after buying cards?** Yes. Trade and buy phases are interleaved.  
- **Does Big Deal help if I have 0 Ducati icons?** Yes. 0 + 1 = 1 → gain 1 Ducati.  
- **Can I gain Prestige from multiple trades in one turn?** No. Max 1 Prestige per player per turn.  
- **What if Goods Deck is empty during Market Action?** Use reshuffled discard pile as new deck.
