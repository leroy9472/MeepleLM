## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Mall of Horror*, players are survivors trapped in a mall overrun by zombies. The goal is to survive as long as possible, avoid being eaten, and be the last survivor standing—or at least the one with the most Victory Points when the game ends. Victory is determined by surviving characters and unused cards.

### 2. Components  
- Character tokens: Pin-Up, Tough Guy, Gunman (each player has one of each); Little Girl (in 3-player games)
- Voting Wheels (one per player)
- Action Cards: Hardware, Weapon, Hidden, Sprint, Threat, Security Camera
- Zombie tokens
- Dice (2 for setup, 4 for zombie rolls)
- Dice box
- “Closed” location masks
- Chief of Security badge
- Board with 6 locations:
  - Location 1: Unknown
  - Location 2: Cachou (closed in 3- or 4-player games)
  - Location 3: Unknown
  - Location 4: Parking Lot (never condemned)
  - Location 5: Security HQ
  - Location 6: Supermarket (only 4 zombies needed to enter)

### 3. Setup  
1. **Choose Characters**: Each player picks a color and takes matching Pin-Up, Tough Guy, and Gunman tokens. In 3-player games, each also takes the Little Girl. Each receives one random Action card; the rest form a face-down deck.
2. **Chief of Security**: The oldest player becomes the initial Chief and takes the badge.
3. **Close Location**: In 3- or 4-player games, close Cachou (Location 2) at the start.
4. **Place Characters**: Starting with the Chief and proceeding clockwise, each player rolls 2 dice and places one character in a location matching either die. If both locations are full, the player may choose any non-full location. Repeat until all characters are placed.
5. **Place Zombies**: The Chief rolls 4 dice and places one zombie in front of each indicated location. Ignore rolls for closed locations.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in the following order:

#### A. Search the Truck  
- All characters in the Parking Lot (Location 4) vote to decide who searches the truck.
- Players may play cards before voting.
- Voting is simultaneous using Voting Wheels. Only characters in the Parking Lot may be voted for.
- Winner draws the top 3 Action cards, keeps one, gives one to any player, and places the third at the bottom of the deck.
- Tie in vote → re-vote with non-present players getting one vote each. Tie in re-vote → no cards distributed.
- If no Action cards remain, skip this phase.

#### B. Elect the Chief of Security  
- All characters in Security HQ (Location 5) vote to elect the new Chief.
- Only those present may be voted for.
- Voting is simultaneous.
- Tie → re-vote; non-present players get one vote each. Tie in re-vote → no new Chief is elected; current Chief remains.
- If Security HQ is condemned, no election occurs; current Chief remains.
- If the current Chief is eliminated, the next player clockwise becomes Chief.

#### C. Arrival of the Zombies  
- The Chief rolls 4 dice under the dice box.
- Only a Chief *elected this round* may look at the dice.
- Players (in clockwise order) may play a **Security Camera** card to view the dice.
- No other information about the roll may be shared, but players may lie or negotiate freely.

#### D. Choose Destinations  
- If the Chief was elected this round, they must declare their destination first.
- All other players choose destinations simultaneously using their Voting Wheels.
- Players may not choose closed locations.
- Players may choose full locations (hoping others move out).
- No location may exceed its pin capacity (indicated by push-pins).

#### E. Move Characters  
- Destinations are revealed simultaneously.
- The Chief places zombies according to the 4 dice. Rolls for closed locations are ignored.
- If any *non-Parking Lot* location has 8 or more zombies after placement, it is **condemned**:
  - Place a “Closed” mask.
  - Remove all zombies.
  - The location remains closed for the rest of the game.
  - Parking Lot (Location 4) can never be condemned.
- Starting with the Chief and proceeding clockwise, players move one character to their chosen destination.
  - If the destination is full, the character goes to the Parking Lot instead.
  - A player **must** move a character.
  - A **Sprint** card may be played on a player’s turn to change destination (even back to the same location).
- Cards may be played during movement.

#### F. Attack of the Zombies  
1. **Add Extra Zombies**:
   - One extra zombie is placed at the location with the most characters (busiest).
   - One extra zombie is placed at the location with the most Pin-Ups (noisiest).
   - If there’s a tie in either category, no extra zombie is added.
2. **Resolve Attacks**:
   - Process locations in order from 1 to 6.
   - For each location:
     - If zombies ≥ characters, zombies **enter**.
       - Exception: Supermarket (Location 6) — 4 zombies are enough to enter, regardless of character count.
     - Tough Guys count as 2 characters when determining entry.
   - If zombies enter:
     - All players with at least one character in the location vote to decide who loses a character.
     - Players may play Action cards **before** the vote to reduce zombie numbers.
       - **Hardware**: Prevents one extra zombie from entering.
       - **Weapon**: Kills 1 or 2 zombies (based on card shadows).
       - **Hidden**: Makes one character immune to being eaten and unable to vote; still counts for blocking zombies.
     - Voting is simultaneous.
     - Tie → random selection (based on player count: 50% for 2 players, 33.3% for 3, etc.).
   - If zombies **do not enter**, they remain outside.
   - After resolution:
     - Eaten characters are removed.
     - Zombies that fed are removed (except Zed Heads — see Special Zombies).
     - Zombies that did **not** feed remain outside the location.
   - **Parking Lot Exception**:
     - Every zombie in the Parking Lot feeds, one at a time.
     - A vote is held for each zombie individually.
     - Hidden characters are immune.
     - After all votes, **all zombies are removed** from the Parking Lot.
     - The Parking Lot is always cleared at the end of this phase.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Voting Rules  
- Only characters in a location may be voted for.
- Players with multiple characters in a location have that many votes.
- Gunmen provide **+1 extra vote** when present.
- **Threat cards**: Discard to gain +1 vote per card. Valid for re-votes. Cannot play additional cards between votes.
- Re-votes:
  - Triggered by tie.
  - Non-present players get **one vote**.
  - Only characters involved in the tie may be voted for.

#### Card Effects  
- **Hardware**: Blocks one extra zombie. Cannot be used in Parking Lot or against 4+ zombies in Supermarket.
- **Weapon**: Kills 1 or 2 zombies immediately (based on card).
- **Hidden**: One character is immune to being eaten and cannot vote. Still counts toward blocking zombies. Effect lasts the entire round. Can be used in Parking Lot for all votes that round.
- **Sprint**: Play on your turn to change destination after revealing. Can return to previous location.
- **Threat**: Grants +1 vote per card played. Valid for re-votes.
- **Security Camera**: Allows viewing of zombie dice roll during Arrival phase.
- All played cards are **removed from the game**.

#### Player Elimination  
- A player with no characters is eliminated from active play.
- They may still:
  - Vote in re-votes (if no one is present).
  - On the next **Choose Destinations phase (D)**, place one zombie at a location of their choice.
- This happens **only once**, when they are eliminated.

#### Special Zombies (Optional Rules)  
- **Zed Heads**:
  - Created when rolling doubles during zombie placement.
  - One Zed Head per double (e.g., two doubles = two Zed Heads; triple = 2 Zed Heads; quadruple = 3 Zed Heads).
  - Zed Heads **remain after a kill** (unlike normal zombies).
- **Zacks**:
  - Created when a character is killed at a location with a Zed Head.
  - The dead character becomes a Zack and stays at the location.
  - Whenever a player leaves that location, the Zack **follows** them.
    - If another player leaves afterward, the Zack follows the next one.
  - Zacks are removed after a successful kill (i.e., when they help eat someone).
  - Zacks and Zed Heads can be killed like normal zombies.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends at the **end of the round** when **one** of the following occurs:
- Only **4 characters** remain (6 in a 6-player game).
- All remaining characters are at the **same location**, but **not** the Parking Lot.

**Winning**:
- Winner is the player with the most **Victory Points** (sum of numbers on surviving character tokens).
- **Tiebreaker**: Most unused Action cards.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can zombies be placed in closed locations during setup or arrival?**  
  → No. Ignore dice showing closed locations.

- **Can the initial Chief look at the zombie dice?**  
  → No. Only Chiefs *elected this round* may view the roll.

- **Can players negotiate or lie?**  
  → Yes. Negotiation, threats, and lies are encouraged. However, players **cannot show** dice or cards to others, except when giving a card from the truck.

- **Can a player stay in the Parking Lot by moving out and back in?**  
  → Yes. If a player’s destination is full and they have a character in the Parking Lot, they can move that character and return it.

- **Can a Hidden card be played after losing a vote?**  
  → No. Must be played **before** the vote.

- **What happens if all characters in a location are Hidden?**  
  → Zombies enter but cannot eat anyone. They remain outside.

- **Can zombies accumulate in the Supermarket if it’s empty?**  
  → Yes. They remain until they either eat someone or reach 8, at which point the Supermarket is condemned.

- **Can a player give cards to others?**  
  → Only the truck searcher may give one card to another player. All other card trading is forbidden.

- **What happens if the Security HQ is condemned?**  
  → No Chief election occurs. Current Chief remains. No one can view dice unless using Security Camera.

- **Does the game end immediately when 4 characters remain?**  
  → No. The current round finishes before checking end conditions.

- **Can Sprint be used to avoid moving?**  
  → No. A character must move, but Sprint allows changing destination after seeing others’ choices.
