## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Wealth of Nations is a strategy game of industrial production and international trade. Players take on the roles of competing economic powers, developing industrial blocs to produce and trade commodities. The goal is to maximize Victory Points (VPs) by building industry tiles, accumulating wealth, and managing debt. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Hexagonal game board  
- 6 Market boards: Food (yellow), Energy (blue), Labor (red), Ore (white), Capital (black), Finance (purple)  
- 15 Farm tiles, 9 Generator tiles, 9 Academy tiles, 9 Mine tiles, 9 Factory tiles, 9 Bank tiles  
- Commodity cubes: 60 Food, 50 Energy, 50 Labor, 40 Ore, 40 Capital  
- 30 Promissory notes  
- 9 Automation tokens  
- 108 Flags (18 per player)  
- 200 Monetary notes  
- 6 Reference cards  
- 1 First Player Marker  

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the hex board in the center.  
2. Arrange the 6 Market boards around it in order: Food, Energy, Labor, Ore, Capital, Finance.  
3. Fill each market’s Starting Market Area:  
   - Place one commodity cube in each well of the starting (lower) half of the market.  
   - Remaining cubes go to the supply area.  
4. Stack Automation tokens, money, and Promissory notes on the Finance Market.  
5. Assemble 5 Starting Packages:  
   - Package 1: 3 Farms + 6 Food  
   - Package 2: 2 Generators + 3 Energy  
   - Package 3: 2 Academies + 3 Labor  
   - Package 4: 2 Mines + 2 Ore  
   - Package 5: 2 Factories + 2 Capital  
6. Randomly determine the first player.  
7. Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player selects one unclaimed Starting Package.  
   - Immediately place all tiles from the package on the board in a contiguous group.  
   - Tiles must follow placement rules (matching partial dots or using Force Placement).  
   - Place one of your flags on each tile.  
   - Take the listed commodities.  
8. In a 2-player game, each player selects a second package (tiles need not be adjacent to the first).  
9. Each player receives starting cash:  
   - 2 players: $5 each  
   - 3 players: $0, $5, $15  
   - 4 players: $0, $5, $15, $25  
   - 5 players: $0, $5, $15, $25, $35  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A round consists of four phases, in order:  
1. **Interest Phase**: Each player pays $1 per Promissory note held.  
2. **Trade Phase**: Players take turns performing one action at a time until all pass consecutively.  
3. **Develop Phase**: Players take turns performing one action at a time until all pass consecutively.  
4. **Produce Phase**: All players run their industrial blocs.  
After each round, pass the First Player Marker to the left.

#### Trade Phase Actions (choose one per turn):  
- Buy 1–3 commodity cubes (one at a time) from any market.  
- Sell 1–3 commodity cubes (one at a time) to any market.  
- Barter with one other player.  
- Pass.  
Promissory notes may be borrowed or repaid at any time during this phase.

#### Develop Phase Actions (choose one per turn):  
- **Place a Flag**: Spend 1 Labor cube to place a flag on an empty hex adjacent to one of your flags. Cannot place in center hex.  
- **Build an Industry Tile**: Build on a hex with your flag. Pay listed cost. Must follow dot-matching rules unless using Force Placement.  
- **Move Industry Tiles**: Spend 1 Capital cube to move up to 3 of your tiles to any empty or flagged (by you) hex. Force Placement applies if needed.  
- **Automate a Bloc**: Spend 1 Energy + 2 Capital to place an Automation token on one of your industrial blocs.  
- **Pass**.

#### Produce Phase:  
- Feed and power all blocs before producing.  
- Cost to run a bloc:  
  - 1 Food per non-Farm tile  
  - 1 Energy per non-Generator bloc  
- Automated blocs may be fed with 1 Ore instead of 1 Food per tile.  
- Each full dot in a powered and fed bloc produces:  
  - 1 commodity cube (matching the bloc’s type)  
  - $30 per full dot for Bank blocs  
- Shared full dots between adjacent same-type blocs produce nothing.  
- Cannot use commodities produced this phase to run blocs.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Market Mechanics  
- Markets have rows of wells holding commodity cubes.  
- **Buy**: Always buy the cheapest available cube (lowest buy price, bottom-right). Pay the listed buy price. If market is empty, buy from supply at “Market Empty Buy Price.”  
- **Sell**: Always sell to the highest available price (top-left empty well). Receive the listed sell price. If market is full, sell to supply at “Market Full Sell Price.”  
- Prices change dynamically with each transaction.  

#### Force Placement  
- Spend 1 Capital cube to ignore partial dot color mismatches when building or moving a tile.  
- Applies to the entire tile regardless of number of conflicts.  
- Capital cube goes to supply area, not market row.  

#### Automation  
- Costs 1 Energy + 2 Capital to automate a bloc.  
- Automated bloc can be fed with 1 Ore instead of 1 Food per tile.  
- Still requires 1 Energy to power (unless Generators).  
- If bloc splits, only one resulting bloc retains automation (player’s choice).  

#### Barter  
- Occurs between active player and one other player.  
- Can trade any combination of commodities, money, or Promissory notes.  
- Cannot trade flags or tiles.  
- Ends the active player’s current turn in the Trade Phase.  

#### Promissory Notes  
- Borrow: Receive $20 per note (in V3.01).  
- Repay: Pay $25 and return the note.  
- Interest: Pay $1 per note each time you perform the Produce action.  
- End Game: Each unredeemed note reduces final score by 3 VPs.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### End Game Triggers (checked at end of Develop Phase):  
- Any player places their 18th flag.  
- Every board hex contains a flag or industry tile.  
- At least 5 of the 6 industry stacks are exhausted.  

#### Final Phases:  
After triggering, complete:  
1. One final Produce phase  
2. One final Interest phase  
3. One final Trade phase  

#### Final Trade (V2 rules variant):  
- For each commodity:  
  1. Sum all cubes of that type held by all players.  
  2. Divide by 2, round down.  
  3. Count down that many empty wells from the top of the market.  
  4. All players sell all cubes of that type at the sell price of the next well down.  

#### Victory Points:  
- 4 VPs per industry tile on the board  
- 1 VP per $10 (round down)  
- –3 VPs per unredeemed Promissory note  

#### Tiebreakers:  
1. Most money  
2. Most flags on the board  
3. Shared victory if still tied  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I hold industry tiles off the board?**  
  No. Tiles must be placed immediately when built.  
- **Can I place a flag not adjacent to my existing flags?**  
  No. All flags must be placed adjacent to an existing flag of the same player.  
- **Can I run a bloc partially?**  
  Yes. You may choose not to feed some tiles. Dots on unfed tiles (even partially) do not produce.  
- **What happens if a market runs out of cubes?**  
  Buy from supply at “Market Empty Buy Price.”  
- **Can I automate a bloc with only one tile?**  
  Yes.  
- **Do Generators need Energy?**  
  No. Generators power themselves.  
- **Do Farms need Food?**  
  No. Farms feed themselves.
