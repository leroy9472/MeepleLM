## Comprehensive Reference Manual  

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Players enter the volatile world of currency trading, building portfolios through strategic bidding and swapping. The goal is to maximize the value of your hand by the end of the game through smart trades and set bonuses. The player with the highest score after the final round wins.  

### 2. Components  
- 63 bank notes: 7 currencies × 9 cards each (3 × 20, 3 × 30, 1 × 40, 1 × 50, 1 × 60)  
- 6 silver-coin cards (10 points each)  
- 6 gold-coin cards (20 points each) — *Note: discrepancy with other sources; see clarification below*  
- 5 bluff cards ("newspaper" or "Gryphon Games Note")  
- 1 draw deck formed from shuffled bank notes, coins, and bluff cards  
- Scorepad and pencil  

*Note: Multiple versions exist. The core version (Money Rules.md) includes 6 coin cards of 10 points and 5 bluff cards. This summary uses data from all sources but defaults to the most consistent version.*  

### 3. Setup  
- **Player count adjustment**:  
  - 3 players: Remove all cards of 2 currencies  
  - 4 players: Remove all cards of 1 currency  
  - 5 players: Use full deck  
- Shuffle remaining bank notes and coin cards together.  
- Deal 6 cards face down to each player.  
- Give each player 1 bluff card. Combine with dealt cards to form a 7-card hand.  
- Place remaining deck in center as draw pile.  
- Reveal 4 cards to the **right** of the deck (right display).  
- Reveal 4 cards to the **left** of the deck (left display).  
- Designate a scorekeeper with paper and pencil.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in the following order:  

1. **Bidding Phase**  
   - All players simultaneously select a bid from their hand and place it face down.  
   - Bid may include any number of cards, including bluff cards.  
   - A bid consisting **only** of the bluff card means the player opts out of the round.  

2. **Reveal Phase**  
   - All bids are revealed simultaneously.  
   - Players who revealed only a bluff card return it to their hand and take no further action this round.  
   - All other bid cards remain face up on the table.  

3. **Exchange Phase**  
   - Determine turn order:  
     - Rank players by bid value (sum of card values).  
     - Tiebreaker: Player with the **lowest serial number** (FRED ###) on any bid card goes first.  
   - Starting with highest bid, each player takes one of three actions:  
     a. **Swap with display**: Take all cards from either left or right display; place your bid cards into that display.  
     b. **Swap with a player**: Take all cards from another player’s bid; give your bid cards to that player. That player now has the highest bid and takes their turn next.  
     c. **Keep**: Take your bid cards back into your hand (no exchange).  
   - After a player completes their action, the next highest remaining bid acts.  
   - If a player swaps with another, the recipient becomes the new highest bidder and acts immediately.  
   - Continue until all bidding players have acted.  

4. **Refill Phase**  
   - After all exchanges, refill displays:  
     - First, refill the **right** display to 4 cards.  
     - Then, refill the **left** display to 4 cards.  
     - If insufficient cards remain, deal what is available (right first).  

5. **Next Round**  
   - Begin a new round with bidding.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Bid Value**: Sum of face values of non-bluff cards in bid. Bluff cards have no value.  
- **Serial Number Tiebreaker**: FRED serial numbers (e.g., FRED 001 to FRED 069); lowest wins tie.  
- **Swap Priority**: Highest bid chooses first; swapping with a player transfers priority to them.  
- **Bluff Card Use**: Can disguise bid size; if used alone, player skips the round.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Game End**: Triggered when draw pile is exhausted during refill. One final round is played.  
- **Final Scoring Steps**:  
  1. Sort all cards by currency and type.  
  2. For each **currency**:  
     - If total value ≥ 200 → score full value.  
     - If total value < 200 → subtract 100 (minimum score = 0).  
  3. For **coins**:  
     - Silver coins: 10 points each (always keep value).  
     - Gold coins: 20 points each (if included; source conflict noted).  
  4. **Triplet Bonuses**:  
     - 100 points for each triplet:  
       - Three 20s of same currency  
       - Three 30s of same currency  
       - (Optional: 3 silver coins or 3 gold coins — only in *Pan tu nie stal* version)  
  5. **Full Currency Bonus**:  
     - If a player holds all 9 bank notes of a single currency:  
       - Score 500 points (300 face value + 200 bonus for two triplets).  
- **Final Score**: Sum of all currency values, coin values, and bonuses.  
- **Winning**: Highest score wins. Ties result in shared victory.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I bid zero?** Yes, by bidding only the bluff card. You skip the round.  
- **What if two players tie with same bid and lowest serial number?** Sources do not specify; assume players agree or use secondary tiebreaker (e.g., clockwise order).  
- **Can I swap with a player who bid only bluff?** No — their bid is not on table. Only active bids (non-bluff) are eligible.  
- **What happens if display has more than 4 cards?** Only happens if not fully refilled previously. No action needed; trade as normal.  
- **Can I take back my bid after seeing others?** No — turn order is fixed after reveal; you must act when your turn comes.
