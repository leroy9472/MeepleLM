## Machu Picchu – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Machu Picchu*, players take on the roles of Inca princes striving to protect their civilization from Spanish conquest. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by managing resources, deploying workers, performing sacrifices, and advancing along the Inca Trail. The game ends in one of two ways: either the Inca successfully rescue Machu Picchu (early end), or the Spanish arrive after Day 9 (standard end). The winner is determined by VP scoring, with special bonuses for gold in the conquest scenario.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Production Districts (Corn, Cloth, Coca, Pottery, Llama)  
- On entering: Take all bonus goods present.  
- If any goods were taken, each Inca in the district (starting with current player) may **produce 1 unit** of the district’s good:  
  - Corn: Free (3 corn = 1 unit)  
  - Others: Cost 1 corn each  

#### Deploy New Incas

- Advance scout **2 steps per good**.  
- 3 corn = 1 good  

**Condor, Puma, Sun Temples** (require matching Priest/Virgin):

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End Triggers (Any One Ends Game)  
1. **Last Priest/Virgin Tile Taken** → Finish current turn  
2. **Sacrifice Card Deck Empty** → Players due a card get **+3 VP** instead  
3. **Time Marker Reaches Day 9 End** → Game ends after final turn (no Night)

#### Victory Points (VP) – All Endings  
- **1 VP** per Priest/Virgin matching icons on your Sacrifice cards  
- **1 VP** per Inca in a district matching icons on your cards  
- **1 VP** if scout is at or above **Granary (7–12)**  
- **2 VP** if scout is at or above **Stable (13–19 or 20)**  

#### Spanish Conquest Scoring (If Game Ends on Day 9)  
- Total **gold** (cubes) on your Sacrifice cards  
- **+1 gold** if scout ≥7  
- **+2 gold** if scout ≥13  
- **Most gold**: Multiply **total VP x3**  
- **Second most gold**: Multiply **total VP x2**  
- Ties: All tied players get the multiplier

#### Final Scoring  
- Total VP as above.  
- **Tiebreaker**: Most goods (3 corn = 1 good)

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you move to a district with your prince and not trigger the action?**  
  No. Movement always triggers the action unless you choose the "take Moon tile" option (which skips action).  
- **When do Inca Trail rewards occur?**  
  At **end of the turn** in which the space is reached (e.g., reach 7 during turn → get 3 corn after turn ends).  
- **Can you sacrifice more than once per temple per day?**  
  No. Only **one activation per temple per day** via prince entry.  
- **Do you need a Prince in a temple to sacrifice?**  
  No. Once a temple is activated (by anyone entering), all players may sacrifice if eligible.  
- **Can you use corn from a free Moon reward to pay for a good?**  
  Yes. Moon rewards are resolved one player at a time; you may use corn earned from free reward to pay for a good in the same step.  
- **What happens when scout reaches 20?**  
  Return to 0, draw 3 cards, keep 1, return 2 to bottom of deck.  
- **Can you take a Moon tile if only 1 or 2 have been taken?**  
  Yes, but taking the **3rd** triggers end of day.
