## 1. Lore & Objective

Each player represents a subway builder constructing lines for the Paris Metro in 1900. The goal is to score the most points by completing long routes connecting stations. Routes that end at central stations score double points. Players earn points when any completed route—whether their own or an opponent’s—connects two stations via continuous track.

## 2. Components

- 1 game board featuring:
  - 32 stations
  - 60 empty spaces for tile placement
  - 100-point score track around the perimeter (color-coded, one per player)
- 60 rail tiles (4 copies of each type)
- 61 subway car markers (6 colors, 10 per player + 1 extra)
- 6 initial layout cards (one per player color)
- 6 score markers (one per player color)

*Note: The Metro Stock Auction Variant requires additional components not included in the base game: 2 extra player colors (pawns and cubes), used for stock mechanics. These must be borrowed from other games.*

## 3. Setup

1. Place the game board in the center of the table.
2. Each player:
   - Takes all subway car markers in one color (10 total).
   - Takes a score marker in the same color.
   - Places their score marker on the “0” space of the score track.
   - Takes the initial layout card matching their color.
3. Based on player count, each layout card shows which stations the player controls. Place one subway car marker on each designated station.
   - Unused subway car markers are set aside.
4. Shuffle the 60 rail tiles and place them face-down in a draw pile next to the board.
5. Each player draws one rail tile.
6. The youngest player goes first. Play proceeds clockwise.

## 4. Gameplay Flow

On a player’s turn, they must do one of the following:

- **Option A:** Play the tile in hand to the board, then draw a new tile.
- **Option B:** Draw a new tile from the pile and immediately play it to the board. The original tile is kept (no second draw).

After placing a tile:
- If the player has no tile in hand, they draw one.
- If they still hold a tile, they do not draw.

Play continues clockwise.

### Tile Placement Rules

When placing a rail tile, observe these four rules:

1. **Placement Location:** The tile must go in an empty space. It must either:
   - Be adjacent (edge-to-edge, not diagonal) to at least one previously placed tile, **or**
   - Be placed along the outer edge of the board.

2. **Orientation Requirement:** The arrow on the rail tile must align with the arrow mark on the board space where it is placed.

3. **No One-Tile Connections:** A tile may not connect two stations using only itself (e.g., a curve tile linking a corner station directly to an adjacent side station).  
   *Exception:* If no legal move exists without violating this rule, a one-tile connection is allowed.

4. **Adjacent Opponent Lines Allowed:** Players may place tiles adjacent to opponents’ stations or tracks, as long as the above rules are followed.

### Completed Routes & Scoring

A route is complete when a continuous rail line connects **any two stations**, regardless of ownership.

When a route is completed:

- Score **1 point per rail tile** used in the continuous path between the two stations.
- If the route crosses over the **same tile more than once**, that tile is counted each time it is traversed.
- If the route ends at a **central station** (stations located in the center area of the board), the entire route score is **doubled**.
- The **owner of the starting station** (where the route began) receives the points.
- Move their score marker along the track to reflect the total.
- Rotate the subway car marker at the starting station **90 degrees** to indicate the route is complete (each station scores only once).

*Important:* Any player who completes a route—by placing the final connecting tile—triggers scoring, but **the points go to the station owner**, not the player who placed the tile.

### Special Notes

- Closed loops not connected to any station have no effect and are ignored.
- A player may continue playing tiles even if all their routes are complete or they have no open stations.
- A player may complete multiple routes with a single tile placement; each qualifying route is scored separately.

## 5. Core Mechanics

- **Tile Laying:** Central mechanic. Players place tiles to extend or complete routes.
- **Route Completion:** Triggers immediate scoring. Can benefit any player depending on station ownership.
- **Scoring Ownership:** Determined by **starting station**, not tile placer.
- **Double Scoring:** Central destination = double points for full route.
- **Tile Reuse in Paths:** Loops that cross the same tile multiple times count each crossing.
- **Station Locking:** Once a station scores, it is marked (90° turn) and cannot score again.

## 6. Scoring & End Game

### Game End Conditions

The game ends when:
- All rail tiles have been placed, **and**
- All possible route completions have been scored.

### Final Winner

- The player with the **highest total score** wins.
- The scoring track allows only one marker per space. If a player lands on an occupied space, they move to the next available higher space.
- This prevents ties: no two players can share the same score.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

**Q: Can I score points for completing an opponent’s route?**  
A: No. The **owner of the starting station** scores the points, even if an opponent places the final tile.

**Q: Can a route start and end at the same player’s stations?**  
A: Yes. If a continuous line connects two of your stations (or loops back), you score when the first connection is made from one of your stations.

**Q: Can a route loop through the same tile twice?**  
A: Yes. Each traversal counts as one point. For example, looping over a tile three times counts it three times.

**Q: What if I can’t place a tile without making a one-tile connection?**  
A: You may make the one-tile connection as a last resort, per the exception rule.

**Q: Can I place a tile adjacent to an opponent’s station?**  
A: Yes, as long as placement rules are followed.

**Q: Do I draw a tile after playing?**  
A: Only if you have no tile in hand after your action. If you still hold a tile, do not draw.

**Q: Can a completed route use more than one of my stations?**  
A: Yes, but each station can only be used once as a starting point for scoring.
