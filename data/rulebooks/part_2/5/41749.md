### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Initial Auction Round  
- The banker selects the first share to auction (from any company).  
- Minimum bid: $10. The banker must either bid or pass.  
- Bidding proceeds clockwise. Each player must either raise the bid or pass. Once passed, a player cannot re-enter.  
- The winner:  
  1. Receives the share  
  2. Pays bid to the company’s treasury  
  3. Places one track cube from that company on any unoccupied city  
  4. Sets the company’s income marker to the **full value** of that city  
  5. Places their action marker on the lowest available space on the turn order track  
  6. Selects the next share to auction and chooses to bid or pass first  
- If all players pass on a share, it is removed from the game.  
- This continues until **one share from each company** has been auctioned (six total auctions).  
- After all six auctions:  
  - Any player with no shares places their action marker on the lowest available space on the turn order track, starting with the banker and proceeding clockwise.

#### Turn Order & Action Phases  
- Each round has **three Action Phases**.  
- **Phase 1**: The player at the top of the **turn order track** (space #1) moves their action marker to an empty space in the **first column** of the action track and may perform the corresponding action. Play proceeds down the turn order track.  
- **Phases 2 and 3**: The player whose marker is **closest to the top** on the **action track** moves to the next column and acts first. The next-highest follows, and so on.  
- A player may **choose an action but not perform it** (e.g., to block it).  

#### Available Actions  
- **Pass**: Do nothing.  
- **Develop**:  
  - Take a black development cube and place it on any **undeveloped city** with at least one track cube (any color).

- **Full value** (left number): if only **one company** has track in the city.  
- **Shared value** (right number): if **two or more companies** have track.  
- When placing the **first cube** in a city:

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I place a development cube in a city with only an opponent’s track?**  
  Yes, as long as at least one track cube (any color) is present.  

- **What happens to income when a second company enters a city?**  
  The new company gains the **shared value**. The original company **loses the difference** between full and shared value.  

- **Can I expand into a mountain hex if another company already has a cube there?**  
  No. Mountain and forest hexes can contain **only one cube total**, regardless of color.  

- **Can I choose an action and not perform it?**  
  Yes. You may move your marker to an action space and **decline to execute** it (e.g., to block).  

- **Who sets turn order after the first round?**  
  After each round, players move their action markers from the **rightmost column** of the action track back to the **turn order track**, **preserving their relative order** (top to bottom).  

- **Are unsold shares counted in dividend calculation?**  
  No. Only **player-held shares** are counted. Shares removed from the game or still in supply are **ignored**.
