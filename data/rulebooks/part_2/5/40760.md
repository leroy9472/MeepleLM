## Alea Iacta Est – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Each player assumes the role of Caesar, vying for the greatest Fame Points by strategically placing dice across five Roman buildings. Players expand provinces, recruit patricians, and curry favor with Fortuna through careful decisions. Though dice are involved, victory favors clever placement over luck. The player with the most Fame Points at the end of the game wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts **5 rounds (4–5 players)** or **6 rounds (2–3 players)**. Each round proceeds as follows:

1. **Starting Player rolls all 8 dice.**  
2. **Players take turns clockwise.** On a turn:  
   - Roll all unplaced dice.  
   - Optionally use one or more Re-Roll Tokens to re-roll any dice.  
   - Place a group of dice on **one** building, following its rules.  
   - A player may **start a new group** OR **add to an existing group**, but **not both** in the same turn.  
   - At least one die must be placed per turn.  
3. **Round ends** when any player places their **last die**.  
   - All remaining players get **one final turn** to place dice.  
   - Any unplaced dice are moved to the Letrinas.  
4. **Evaluate all 5 buildings** in order:  
   - Templo → Senado → Castrum → Foro Romano → Letrinas  
5. **Reset for next round**:  
   - Return all dice to players.  
   - Discard unclaimed Province and Patrician tiles.  
   - Reveal new Province cards (1 per player) and new Patricians (1 per Foro column).  
   - Pass Starting Player marker to the left.  

Repeat until all rounds are complete.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### I. Templo (4–5 players only)  
- Players place dice in increasing group size:  
  - 1st player: 1 die → takes 1 Fortuna tile (face down).  
  - 2nd player: 2 dice → sum must exceed previous single die → takes 2 Fortuna.  
  - 3rd player: 3 dice → sum must exceed previous pair → takes 3 Fortuna, etc.  
- A player may return in later turns to add dice to meet the current group size, but only takes Fortuna equal to **new dice placed**.  
- **End of Round Evaluation**:  
  - The player who placed the **most dice** this round keeps **2** Fortuna tiles.  
  - All others keep **1**.  
  - Discarded Fortuna tiles go face up near Templo. When face-down stack runs out, shuffle face-up tiles back.  
  - **Exception**: If only one die was placed, that player keeps **2** Fortuna.

#### II. Senado  
- Players place dice in **ascending numerical sequence** (a "ladder" or straight).  
- Minimum: 1 die (rarely useful). Maximum: 6 dice.  
- A player may only have **one ladder** in the Senado per round.  
- May extend own ladder on later turns (from either end).  
- **No duplicate ladders allowed** – no other player may have the same combination of **number of dice** and **values**.  
  - Example: 3–4–5 blocks others from placing 3–4–5, but 4–5–6 or 2–3–4–5 are allowed.  

- **End of Round Evaluation**:  
  - Players ranked by **length** of ladder.  
  - **Tiebreaker**: Higher total value (e.g., 5–4–3–2 > 4–3–2–1).  
  - Top 2 players receive S.P.Q.R. cards:  
    - 1st player: draws top 3 cards, keeps 1, gives 2nd card to 2nd player, places 3rd card face down at bottom.  
    - 2nd player: keeps 1 of the 2 received, returns the other face down.  
  - With **2 players**: Only 1st player gets a card.  
  - With **5 players**: 3rd player receives the discarded card from 2nd.  
  - All dice not claimed go to Letrinas.

#### III. Castrum  
- Players place dice of **same value** (a "group").  
- May place 1 die (e.g., a single "4") or multiple (e.g., three "5"s).  
- A player may have multiple groups of different values.  
- May **add to existing group** or **start new group**, but not both per turn.  
- **No identical groups**: Two players can have same value group only if **number of dice differs**.  
  - Example: One player has two "4"s, another may have three "4"s, but not two.  

- **End of Round Evaluation**:  
  - Rank groups by **number of dice** (largest first).  
  - **Tiebreaker**: Higher die value (e.g., 5–5–5 > 3–3–3).  
  - In order, each player:  
    - Recovers dice.  
    - Selects one face-up Province card and places it in front of them.  
  - When all groups are resolved or no Provinces remain, leftover dice go to Letrinas.  
  - Unclaimed Provinces are removed from the game.

#### IV. Foro Romano  
- Players may place:  
  - One die of **any value**, OR  
  - Two dice summing to **5** (1+4 or 2+3).  
- Place dice **as far left as possible** in columns.  
- Insertion rule:  
  - Place to the **right** of lower values.  
  - Place to the **left** of equal or higher values.  
  - Shift existing dice right to make space.  
- If a die is **pushed off the right end**, it goes to the Letrinas.  

- **End of Round Evaluation**:  
  - Starting from the **rightmost die**, players:  
    - Recover the die.  
    - Select one face-up Patrician from the Foro.  
  - Move leftward until all dice are recovered.  
  - Any unclaimed Patricians are removed from the game.

#### V. Letrinas  
- Dice go here if:  
  - A player cannot legally place elsewhere.  
  - A die is pushed out of the Foro.  
  - Dice remain unplaced at round end.  
- **End of Round Evaluation**:  
  - Each player recovers all their dice.  
  - Each player gains **1 Re-Roll Token** per die placed in Letrinas this round.

#### General Rules  
- One building action per turn.  
- Must place at least one die per turn.  
- Cannot place in Foro outside of column bases.  
- Cannot place two groups in Castrum in one turn.  
- Cannot place one die and a pair summing to 5 in Foro in one turn.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends after **5 rounds (4–5 players)** or **6 rounds (2–3 players)**. Final scoring:

#### 1. Provinces & Patricians  
- Each Province may hold:  
  - Up to 1 man and/or 1 woman.  
  - Must match Province color (except gray wildcard Province: holds any color, but **marriage pair must match**).  
- Scoring:  
  - **Occupied Province**: Value of Province + sum of Patrician values.  
  - **Vacant Province**: Value – 1 (minimum 0).  
  - **Unassigned Patricians**: 0 points.  

#### 2. Senate Cards (S.P.Q.R.)  
- Reveal all cards. Apply their Fame Point bonuses (see Anexo for details).  
- One card ("Descendencia") grants a special advantage.  

#### 3. Fortuna Tiles  
- Each tile is worth its printed value (I=1, II=2, III=3).  

#### 4. Re-Roll Tokens  
- Each **pair** of unused tokens = 1 Fame Point.  
- Odd token: 0.5 → round down (e.g., 5 tokens = 2 points).  

#### Final Total =  
- Province scores  
+ Patrician values (if placed)  
+ S.P.Q.R. card bonuses  
+ Fortuna values  
+ Re-Roll pairs  

#### Tiebreaker  
1. Player with **most valuable unplaced Patricians** (sum of values).  
2. If still tied, **shared victory**.
