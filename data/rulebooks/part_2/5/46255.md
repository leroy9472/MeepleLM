## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Campaign Manager 2008*, players assume the role of campaign managers for either Barack Obama or John McCain during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. The goal is to win the presidency by securing 270 or more electoral votes through strategic use of campaign events, media influence, and demographic targeting.

**Victory Conditions:**  
- McCain wins by reaching **270 electoral votes**, needing **115 additional votes** beyond his base.  
- Obama wins by reaching **270 electoral votes**, needing **113 additional votes** beyond his base (he starts with 2 pre-printed electoral votes on his track).  
- If both players reach exactly 269 votes, the game ends in a **draw**.

### 2. Components  
- 2 sets of **45 Campaign Strategy cards** (red for McCain, blue for Obama)  
- 2 sets of **12 Support markers** (red/blue)  
- 1 **"Going Negative" die**  
- 1 **"Going Negative" results chart**  
- 1 **scoring track** with pre-printed votes (Obama: 2, McCain: 0)  
- 20 **scoring tiles** (representing electoral votes; double-sided red/blue)  
- 20 **Battleground State tiles**  
- 4 **Issue markers** (2 per player)  
- 4 **Key Demographic markers** (2 per player)  
- 1 deck of **20 Breaking News event cards**

### 3. Setup  
**1. Build Your Campaign Decks**  
- Each player shuffles their 45-card deck.  
- Reveal 3 cards at a time; keep 1, remove the other 2 from the game.  
- Repeat until 15 cards are kept (forming the Campaign Deck), and 30 are removed.  
- Shuffle the 15-card deck and draw a **3-card starting hand**.  
- *Optional (first-time players):* Use preconstructed decks marked with a star (☆).

**2. Choose Starting States**  
- Each player selects **2 states** from their 10 state tiles (marked with their logo on the back).  
- Choices are made secretly; reveal and place all 4 states simultaneously.  
- *First-game recommendation:* Use starred states: **Florida, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey**.  
- Place Issue and Key Demographic markers in their starting positions on each state.

**3. Prepare the Breaking News Deck**  
- Shuffle the 20 Breaking News cards and place them face-down near the playing area.

**4. Determine First Player**  
- The player who finishes deck construction first goes first.  
- *First-game alternative:* The player closest to their 18th birthday goes first.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, they must choose **one** of the following actions:  
a) **Play a card** from hand, resolve its effect, then discard it (unless it’s a Media Support card).  
b) **Draw one card** from their Campaign Deck.

**Hand Limit:**  
- A player **cannot draw** if they have **5 or more cards** in hand.  
- Effects that grant card draws may still be resolved even at or above 5 cards.

**Turn Order:**  
- Players alternate turns.  
- After playing a card, resolve all effects **completely**, including winning states and drawing cards.  
- If the played card has a "Going Negative" icon, the **opponent rolls the die** at the **end of the turn** and applies the result.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Gaining Support  
To gain support in a state on a specific issue (Defense/Economy):  
- Replace an opponent’s marker with your own, or  
- Place your marker on an undecided (white) voter.  
- Once a white circle has a marker, it is **no longer undecided** and cannot be removed—only flipped.  
- Exception: **Campaign Fatigue** removes **all** support markers in a state, overriding this rule.

#### Shifting the Issue Track  
- Move the Issue marker up/down the track.  
- The issue it points to is the **majority issue**; the other is **minority**.  
- If the marker is at the edge, further shifts in that direction have no effect.

#### Altering the Key Demographic  
- Move the Key Demographic marker to the other group on the state.  
- Only the current key demographic is affected by Demographic Support cards.

#### Media Support Cards  
- Remain **in play** until replaced by another Media Support card (by either player).  
- Effects apply continuously while in play.  
- Example: *Media Support: Bias* allows the owner to choose which state is affected by Breaking News events.

#### Demographic Support Cards  
- Convert **all undecided voters** in **all in-play states** where the specified group is the **key demographic**.  
- Affects **both majority and minority issue sides**.  
- Cannot affect voters already claimed.

#### Discarding Cards for Effect  
- Some cards require discarding additional cards to activate their effect.  
- "Discard any number" includes **zero**.  
- The played card itself **counts as one discard** if required.  
- You may play a card with no effect to remove it from hand.

#### Going Negative  
- Cards with the die icon require the **opponent to roll the Going Negative die** at the end of the turn.  
- The opponent applies the result from the chart (e.g., gaining support or shifting an issue).  
- **State wins are resolved before** the die is rolled.

#### Winning a State  
- A player wins a state immediately when **all voters on the majority issue side** are their color.  
- Claim the state’s scoring tile and place it on your scoring track (aligned to not cover pre-printed votes).  
- **Immediately after winning**:  
  1. **Choose a new state** to replace the won one (from unused tiles).  
  2. Place Issue and Key Demographic markers in their starting positions.  
  3. Return all support markers to their owners.  
  4. **Draw and resolve a Breaking News card** (unless Media Support overrides targeting).  
- If multiple states are won at once, resolve them one at a time in any order.

#### Breaking News  
- Drawn **each time a new state enters play** (not during initial setup).  
- Resolved **immediately** after the new state is placed.  
- By default, affects the **newly introduced state**.  
- If Media Support (e.g., *Bias*) is in play, the controlling player may redirect the effect.  
- After resolution, the Breaking News card is **removed from the game**.

#### Reshuffling  
- If a player needs to draw but their deck is empty:  
  - Reshuffle their **discard pile** into a new deck.  
  - Cards played **earlier in the turn are not included** in the reshuffle.  
  - Continue play.

#### Card Interactions & Clarifications  
- **"All states" effects** (e.g., *DHS Warns of New Terror Threat*) affect **all in-play states**, regardless of Media Support.  
- **"Game Changer"** can retrieve a card removed by **"No More Politics as Usual"**—such cards are treated as **never drafted**.  
- **Demographic cards** may be played even if they have **no effect** (e.g., no matching key demographic or no undecided voters).  
- **Opponent’s discard pile is public**—all discards are face-up.  
- When a card grants a draw **upon playing**, the player **may look at the drawn card** before choosing a new state after winning.  
- Cards drawn via effects (e.g., *Oprah/Governator*) can be used as **discards** for the same turn’s effect.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Scoring occurs immediately** upon winning a state.  
- Place the scoring tile on your track; total votes are cumulative.  
- Game ends **immediately** when a player reaches or exceeds **270 votes**.  
- If all states are played and no one reaches 270, the player with more votes wins. If tied at 269, it’s a **draw**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can you play a card with no effect?**  
  Yes. You must resolve the card, but it’s legal if the effect does nothing.

- **Does "all states" include new ones brought in later in the same turn?**  
  Yes. "All states" means all currently in play at the time of resolution.

- **Can you choose not to apply a card’s effect?**  
  No. You must resolve the effect, even if it does nothing.

- **Can you use a drawn card as a discard in the same turn?**  
  Yes. Cards drawn as part of an effect can be discarded if required.

- **Is the discard pile public?**  
  Yes. All discards are face-up and public information.

- **Does Campaign Fatigue remove markers from undecided voters?**  
  Yes. It removes **all** support markers, even those on formerly undecided spots.

- **Can "No More Politics as Usual" cancel a Media Support card not in play?**  
  Yes. It cancels the **last card McCain played**, regardless of whether it’s still in play.

- **Can you play a demographic card if no states have that key demographic?**  
  Yes. It’s a legal play, even if it has no effect.
