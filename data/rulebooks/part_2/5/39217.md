### 1. Lore & Objective
Fighting Formations is a WWII tactical wargame series focused on platoon- and squad-level combat. Players control opposing forces in scenario-based battles, aiming to achieve victory through unit destruction, objective control, or unit extraction. Victory is measured by Victory Points (VPs) or specific scenario conditions.

### 2. Components
- **Track Display**: Contains the Order Matrix, Initiative Track, Time Track, and boxes for Command, VP, and Asset management.
- **Maps**: Hex-based maps with terrain features and identifiers.
- **Units**: Square (infantry) or rectangular (guns/vehicles) counters with stats (FP, range, ROF, speed, defense).
- **Command Markers**: Markers for Mission and Tactical Command with radius effects.
- **Hit Markers**: Indicate unit damage (with F/M restrictions).
- **Sighting Markers**: Represent hidden units or false positions.
- **Fortification Markers**: Represent obstacles or protective works.
- **Smoke Markers**: Provide hindrance to fire.
- **Fate Card**: Allows re-rolls and breaks ties.
- **Asset Cards**: Provide order and reaction abilities.

### 3. Setup
- Place Time and Sudden Death markers per scenario.
- Set up units, objectives, and Sighting markers as directed.
- Seed the Order Matrix with order cubes as specified.
- Place Initiative pawn and assign the Fate card per scenario.
- Set Command & Control levels and place Command markers in Available boxes.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Initiative**: The player with Initiative (based on pawn position and Fate card) removes an order cube from the Matrix.
2. **Pay Initiative Cost**: Move the Initiative pawn toward the opponent by the number of the row from which the cube was taken.
3. **Perform Order**: Execute an order (e.g., Move, Fire, Assault) by activating units, paying activation costs based on Command status.
4. **Reactions**: The inactive player may perform Return Fire (during Fire orders) or Opportunity Fire (during Move/Assault orders).
5. **Unactivate Units**: Flip activated units back after actions.
6. **End of Order**: Remove Spent markers and check for turn end (if no cubes remain on Matrix).
7. **Turn End**: Advance the Turn marker and perform admin steps: Sudden Death roll (if applicable), deplete Smoke, Sniper Activity, Regroup Command markers, Reinforcements, and reseed the Matrix.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Initiative**: Determines turn order. The pawn moves based on order costs. The player on the pawn’s side (or with Fate card at 0) acts next.
- **Command & Control**: Command markers provide Mission (0 cost) or Tactical (1 cost) Command within their radius. Out of Command units cost 2 to activate.
- **Activation Costs**:
  - Mission Command: 0 Initiative
  - Tactical Command: 1 Initiative
  - Out of Command: 2 Initiative
- **Orders**:
  - **Advance**: Move 1 hex (infantry only may enter/exit melee). Ignore MPs.
  - **Assault**: Half movement; may fire once for 1 MP (attracts Opportunity Fire). Vehicles only may enter/exit melee.
  - **Asset**: Play one Asset card from hand.
  - **Fire**: Direct or melee fire. Return Fire allowed.
  - **Move**: Spend MPs to move. Guns only may enter/exit melee.
  - **Rally**: Attempt to remove hit markers.
  - **Sniper**: Flip Sniper marker and perform a lower-order action.
  - **Support**: Draw asset cards.
- **Combat**:
  - **Direct Fire**: Roll attack dice (base 2d10), modified by range, fire arc, and conditions. Apply FP + dice vs. Defense + cover + 2d10.
  - **Melee**: Single-target attack using Melee Table target number. Roll dice vs. number.
  - **Hindrance**: Default 1; increased by terrain or Smoke. A die ≤ hindrance causes a miss.
  - **Return Fire**: One reactive shot per fire attack; costs Initiative based on Command status.
  - **Opportunity Fire**: Reactive fire after any MP expenditure; multiple units may fire, each costing Initiative.
- **Movement**:
  - **Forward**: Move into front hex; free adjacent pivot after.
  - **Reverse**: Move into rear hex at 3x cost; free adjacent pivot.
  - **Stationary Pivot**: Spend 1 MP to pivot in place.
  - **Column**: Vehicles in buildings must be In Column (marker), reducing cover to 0 and modifying melee combat.
- **Unit States**:
  - **Hit**: Marked with a hit marker; restricts fire/movement if circled F/M.
  - **Spent**: Cannot perform Return/Op Fire; removed at end of order.
  - **Eliminated**: Squad removed; platoon replaced by two squads (one with hit marker).

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Points**:
  - Eliminate enemy units (VPs per scenario).
  - Control objectives (VPs per hex).
  - Exit units off map (if allowed).
- **Game End**:
  - **Sudden Death**: When Turn marker reaches or passes Sudden Death marker, roll 2d10. If roll < Turn space number, game ends.
  - **Alternate Conditions**: Scenario-specific (e.g., control all objectives).
- **Winner**: Higher VP total; Fate card holder breaks ties.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Command Marker Movement**: Units may carry Command markers during movement.
- **Sniper Activity**: At turn end, the side with the face-up Sniper marker rolls 1d10 vs. enemy Command count. On success, opponent chooses to eliminate a Command marker or reduce Command & Control level.
- **Fate Card**: Can be used to re-roll any single die roll; passes to opponent after use. Breaks ties.
- **Smoke**: Hinders fire into, out of, or through its hex. Depletes at turn end.
- **Platoon Elimination**: Replaced by two squads; one inherits the hit marker.
- **Radioless Units**: Soviet vehicles have doubled Initiative cost for Move/Assault activation.
