## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Nuns on the Run*, novice nuns sneak out of their cells at night to retrieve their Secret Wish, but must avoid detection by the vigilant Abbess and Prioress. Temptation has drawn them from their beds, and only cunning, stealth, and luck will allow them to return unseen.

**Objective:**  
- **Novices:** Be the first to retrieve your **Keys**, then your **Secret Wish**, and return to your cell with both.  
- **Guards (Abbess & Prioress):** Catch novices a number of times equal to the number of players, or prevent any novice from winning by the end of Turn 15.

If multiple novices win on the same turn, the one caught the fewest times wins. If still tied, they share victory.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn has three phases:

#### A. NOVICES MOVE  
1. **Choose Movement**: Each novice selects a movement card and notes:  
   - Final dot reached  
   - Number of dots moved  
   - Movement type (ss/sn/w/r)  
   - Mark "K" if picked up keys, "SW" if obtained Secret Wish  
   - **First turn only**: Move **twice** using the same card (double distance).  
2. **Reveal Movement Cards**: All novices reveal cards simultaneously.  
3. **Noise Check**:  
   - If **either guard walked last turn**, each novice rolls a die.  
   - Apply movement modifier:  
     - Standing Still: –3  
     - Sneak: –2  
     - Walk: –1  
     - Run: 0  
   - Modified result = max hearing range (in dots).  
   - If within range of a **walking guard**, place a **noise token** next to that guard along the shortest path.  
     - Two equal paths? Place on either or both.  
     - Token already present? Stack another.  

#### B. GUARDS MOVE  
1. **Move Guards**: In any order, move each guard:  
   - **Walking**: 3–4 dots  
   - **Running**: 5–6 dots  
   - Must follow assigned **path card** unless diverted (see below).  
2. **Reveal Movement Cards**: After moving, reveal card used (Walk/Run).  
3. **Remove Tokens**: Clear all **noise** and **vanished** tokens from board.  
4. **Hearing Check**:  
   - Each **walking guard** rolls a die.  
   - Base result = max hearing range.  
   - Each novice within range applies movement modifier.  
   - If within modified range, place **noise token** next to the guard.  
     - If within range of **both guards**, place tokens for both.  
5. **Advance Turn Marker**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Line of Sight (LOS)  
- Each guard has a **180° forward arc** of vision.  
- **Max range**: 6 dots. Beyond that, no LOS.  
- **Blocks LOS**:  
  - Doors  
  - Walls (e.g., wall around dot 67, altar wall)  
- **Does NOT block LOS**:  
  - Trees, columns, statues  
- **Special Cases**:  
  - **Dot 82 (tree)**: Only visible if guard is **in dot 82**.  
  - **Chapel dots (59–61, 77–79, 87–89)**: All mutually visible.  
  - **Grouped dots with mutual LOS**:  
    - 12–15, 30–31, 33–35, 51–54 (except **33 blocked from 12–15 and 30–31**)  
    - 37–41, 46–49, 62–64  
    - 73–76, 90–94  

**LOS Check**: After **each dot** a novice moves through (including final), check if in any guard’s LOS.  

#### Visibility & Tokens  
- If **in LOS**, place novice token on the board.  
- If **leaves LOS**, remove token and place a **vanished token** between the last visible dot and the next.  
- **Exception**: If status is "Caught", **no vanished token** is placed when leaving LOS.  

#### Diverting & Free Movement  
A guard may **leave her path** if:  
- Sees a **novice** (token on board)  
- Sees a **vanished token**  
- Has a **noise token** adjacent  

While diverted, guard may move **in any direction** with remaining movement.  
At start of next turn, if no triggers remain, guard returns to path via **shortest route**.  

#### Catching a Novice  
- A novice is **caught** if a guard **ends movement on the same dot**.  
- **Consequences**:  
  - Flip status card to **"Caught"**  
  - Must walk (3–4 dots) toward own cell  
  - Loses **Secret Wish** (must be recollected)  
  - Keeps **Keys**  
  - **Does not roll for noise** while caught  
- Guard scores **1 capture point** (advance "Novices Captured" marker).  

#### Escaping Capture ("On the Run")  
- While "Caught", novice may **return to cell and flip to "On the Run"** at end of turn.  
- Or, when **out of LOS**, may **immediately** flip to "On the Run" and move freely.  
- Once "On the Run", must resume **noise checks**.  

#### Blessings  
- One-time use, discard after use.  
- Play **after die roll** if modifying it.  
- **False Noise (Novice)**: Place noise token **without revealing card** until **next turn**.  
- **False Noise (Guard)**: Allows guard to divert from path as if noise occurred.  

#### Monk Variants  
- **Blind Monk (Frederick)**:  
  - No LOS, but noise markers placed (for info only).  
  - If shares space with novice, **reveals but does not catch**.  
- **Deaf Monk (Robert)**:  
  - No noise checks, but sees novices normally (reveals but does not catch).  
- Both:  
  - Start T1 with one of three paths.  
  - Move 3–4 dots (walk only).  
  - Choose new path at destination (each location visited once).  
  - Return to Garden Gate → **remove from game**.  
  - Use only 4 of 6 path cards.  

#### All or Nun Variant  
- Winning novice is **out of game**.  
- After guard turn, **guard closes eyes**, novices silently point to location.  
- **Novices win**: All return with SW.  
- **Guards win**: Same as base game.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Novice wins immediately** by:  
  1. Getting **Keys**  
  2. Getting **Secret Wish**  
  3. Returning to **cell** with both  
- If multiple win same turn: **fewest captures** wins. Tie = shared victory.  
- **Guards win** if:  
  - "Novices Captured" ≥ number of players  
  - Turn 15 ends with no winner

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can novices pass guards?** No. Moving onto guard’s space = caught.  
- **Guard turning**: At start of each movement step, rotate figure to new direction.  
- **Guard in corner**: Does not turn until next move.  
- **Caught novice in LOS**: Guard **cannot** freely move; must return to path.  
- **Guard movement order**: Player chooses each turn.  
- **Reusing movement cards**: Allowed.  
- **Choosing movement card**: After moving, before revealing.  
- **Guard adapts movement**: Yes — reveal card **after** moving.  
- **First turn noise check**: Yes — novices roll even if guards didn’t move.  
- **Noise check after capture**: Next turn after returning "On the Run".  
- **Blessing after noise check?** No — movement is over; cannot "rewind".  
- **Moving out of LOS as caught**: No vanished token. Guard must return to path.  
- **Caught novice re-enters LOS**: Still "safe" — cannot be caught again.  
- **Seen but not caught**: Place token; if leaves LOS, place vanished token.  
- **Flipping to "On the Run"**: Optional when out of LOS; can remain "Caught".
