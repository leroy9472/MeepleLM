  - Place Election marker on Mayor space.
- **Building Tiles**:
  - Place 12 starting buildings: 4 purple (RES), 4 gold (COM), 2 blue (CIV), 2 red (IND) in designated spots.
- **Decks**:
  - **Town Deck**: Remove Airport event. Place 15 cards face-down at bottom. Shuffle Airport into next 6 cards, place on stack. Place remaining 15 on top. Reveal top 5 cards and top deck card.
  - **City Deck**: Remove Sports Team event. Same structure as Town. Not active initially.
  - **Metropolis Deck**: Remove Olympic Games event. Same structure. Not active initially.
  - **Planning Deck**: Remove 4 Urban Renewal cards (place in discard). Separate 14 events. Shuffle remaining planning cards. Shuffle 14 events into 14 planning cards, place as bottom 28. Place remaining 22 on top. First player draws 1 card, second draws 2, etc. Reveal 4 face-up cards and top deck card.
- **Player Setup**:
  - Each player selects color, takes cubes and cylinder.
  - Starting player takes Active Player tile.
  - Players take turns claiming and paying for starting buildings (pay value = sum of wealth and prestige on intersecting rows).
  - **Wealth**: 2 players: $39; 3 players: $27; 4 players: $21.
  - **Vocations**: Media vocation goes to player with most remaining wealth; tiebreaker is control of 3-value purple building.
  - Place prestige markers at 0. Place wealth/prestige markers in holding box.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn:
1. **Investment (Optional)**: Discard 0+ permit cards from hand, gain wealth equal to their printed wealth value.
2. **Spend Action Points (AP)**: 6 AP (8 if Union Boss). Actions in any order, repeatable:
   - Acquire face-up Build Permit or Urban Renewal card (cost = AP value of slot).
   - Build a contract (cost = AP value of slot; permits + wealth required).
   - Take a contract as a Favor (max 1 at a time; costs AP, not built).
3. **End of Turn**:
   - Slide face-up planning cards down toward 1AP slot.
   - Refill planning track: Draw from Planning Deck until 4 face-up cards and top card revealed. Resolve events, elections, payouts.
   - Slide face-up contract cards down.
   - Refill contract track from active deck(s):
     - Only Town active: Town cards fill all 5 slots.
     - City active: Town → 5AP slot; City → 4,3,2,1AP slots.
     - Metropolis active: Town → 5AP; City → 4AP; Metropolis → 3,2,1AP.
   - Flip top card of each active deck (Town always, then City/Metropolis if active). Resolve events, payouts.
   - Pass Active Player token clockwise.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Action Points (AP)**: 6 per turn; lost if unused. Union Boss gets 8.
- **Permits**: Collected via Planning Deck. Used to pay for building size (1 permit per lot). Zone-specific (RES, COM, CIV, IND).
- **Building**:
  - Pay AP, correct permits, and wealth equal to block value.
  - Must follow zoning: new building must be adjacent to same zone or no zone (parks ignored).
  - Diagonal adjacency counts.
  - Gain 1 prestige per adjacent same-zone building.
  - Claim vocation if named; if none available, steal from opponent.
  - Resolve card text effects.
- **Vocations**:
  - When claimed, all players score: per vocation marker owned, gain X wealth or X prestige (choice), where X = number on card.
- **Wealth & Prestige Markers**:
  - Placed in gray spaces on board edge.
  - Increase value of buildings in their row.
  - When moved, decrease old row, increase new row.
- **Urban Renewal**:
  - Use Urban Renewal card or Contractor ability when building.
  - New building must be ≥ size of demolished building(s).
  - Must occupy all lots of demolished building(s).
  - Zoning checked without demolished buildings.
  - Cannot demolish own building unless using Contractor.
- **Elections**:
  - Triggered by ballot box icon on Planning Card.
  - Election Track advances; elect politician named.
  - **Mayor**: Most vocations; Media breaks tie.
  - **DA**: Most valuable CIV; most CIV buildings if tie; Mayor breaks tie.
  - **Treasurer**: Most valuable COM; most COM; DA breaks tie.
  - **Police Chief**: Most valuable RES; most RES; Treasurer breaks tie.
  - **Union Boss**: Most valuable IND; most IND; Police Chief breaks tie.
  - **Contractor**: After Sports Team event; goes to player with least prestige; Union Boss breaks tie.
- **Payouts**:
  - Triggered by wealth/prestige icon on revealed card.
  - If matching marker on board, score based on # of buildings on that row.
  - Payout table: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th (adjusted for player count).
  - Ties: share points for tied and next rank(s); round down.
- **Events**:
  - **Planning Deck Events**: Resolved, then go to discard (can recur).
  - **Contract Deck Events**: Resolved, then removed from game (one-time).
  - Examples: Estate Auction (auction least valuable building), Urban Decay (auction for 3 prestige), Local Headlines (most valuable building gains 3W/3P).
