# 1882: Assiniboia — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Set in the Canadian territory of Assiniboia in 1882, players act as investors and railroad tycoons competing to amass the greatest personal wealth. The game simulates the early development of western Canada's rail network, with mechanics inspired by historical events such as the North-West Rebellion and the expansion of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The player with the highest net worth at game end wins.

**Victory Condition:** The game ends under three conditions:
- A player goes bankrupt during emergency fundraising.
- A stock price reaches the top-right corner of the stock market:
  - Instantly at the end of a Stock Round if triggered by full ownership.
  - At the end of an Operating Round if triggered by a dividend.
- The bank runs out of money:
  - If during Operating Rounds, game ends after the current set.
  - If during a Stock Round, game ends after one full set of Operating Rounds.

Final scoring: Player wealth = Cash + Value of owned shares (at current stock price) + Face value of private companies (if not yet closed).
