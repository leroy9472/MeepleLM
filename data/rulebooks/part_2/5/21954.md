### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Perikles*, players represent influential Greek families during the Peloponnesian War. The goal is to gain control of six major Greek cities, use their military to win battles over strategic locations, and earn Victory Points (VPs) through influence, battle victories, and commemorative statues. The game ends after three turns, or earlier if Athens or Sparta suffers four defeats. The player with the most VPs wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of 7 phases:

1. **Draw Location and Influence Tiles**  
   - Replace all 7 Location Tiles.  
   - Shuffle all Influence Tiles and place 10 face-up.

2. **Take Influence Tiles**  
   - Starting with the first player (random in Turn 1; Athens’ previous leader in Turns 2–3), players take turns selecting one Influence Tile.  
   - Players must:  
     - Place influence cubes equal to the number of pottery shards on the tile, in the city matching the tile’s color (or any city for "Any City" tiles).  
     - If the tile has a **Candidate** symbol, propose a candidate in any city.  
     - If the tile has an **Assassin** symbol, remove one influence cube (any color, any city) from the board.  
   - Players cannot select a tile of a color they already have, unless no legal tile remains.  
   - Each player takes 5 tiles (4 in a 5-player game).

3. **Propose Candidates**  
   - Starting with the first player, players take turns moving one of their influence cubes (or any player’s cube) from a city to a candidate space (α or β).  
   - First cube placed goes to α; second to β.  
   - Only one cube per player per city allowed.  
   - Continue until all 12 candidate spaces are filled.  
   - Players must propose if able.

4. **Hold Elections**  
   - For each city:  
     - The candidate with more influence cubes wins.  
     - In case of a tie, the α candidate wins.  
     - Remove both candidate cubes.  
     - Winner removes a number of their influence cubes equal to the opponent’s total in that city.  
     - Winner places a Leader counter in the city’s Leader box.  
   - If unopposed, winner only loses the candidate cube.

5. **Commit Military Forces**  
   - Players take control of military counters from cities they lead.  
   - If no city is led, player controls Persian forces.  
   - **Recovery Phase**: Starting with Sparta’s leader, each player recovers one dead counter (hoplite or trireme, lowest value) per city they control.  
   - **Deployment Order**:  
     - Use all Influence Tiles with 2 shards first, then 1 shard.  
     - Within each shard level, play proceeds clockwise from the last player who acted.  
   - When using a tile:  
     - Player may send 0–2 military counters to 1–2 locations.  
     - Counters can be from different cities (if player leads multiple).  
     - First unit on a side becomes Main Attacker/Defender; others are Allies.  
     - Allied units can be from multiple cities.  
   - **Sending Additional Forces**: After placing units, a player may spend one influence cube (from the sending city) to deploy up to two more units from that city (can go to different locations).  
   - Restrictions:  
     - Cannot attack a location controlled by a city you lead.  
     - To defend a location you don’t control, you must get permission from the controlling player.  
     - Once a city attacks a location, it is at war with the controlling city and cannot ally with it elsewhere.  
     - A player cannot have units on both sides of the same battle.

6. **Resolve Battles**  
   - Resolve battles in order (top to bottom).  
   - Each battle has up to two rounds: Hoplite and/or Trireme, in order shown on the tile.  
   - **First Round**:  
     - Winner gains a Battle Token advantage in the second round.  
   - **Second Round**:  
     - Winner takes the Location Tile for VPs.  
   - **Combat Resolution**:  
     - Reveal all units. Add intrinsic strengths:  
       - Gray symbols (defender): +1 to respective combat.  
       - Violet symbols (rebel): +1 to attacker.  
     - Compare attacker vs. defender strength. Use Combat Table column based on ratio or difference:  
       - 3:1, 2:1 (or 1:2), +2, -2, else 1:1.  
       - Use most favorable column for stronger side.  
       - Caps: max 3:1, min 1:2.  
     - Each player rolls 2 dice. Must meet or exceed number in column to claim a Battle Token.  
     - First to win 2 tokens wins the round.  
     - Tie at 2–2: continue until one succeeds and the other fails.  
     - If only one side has units of the required type, they win automatically.  
   - **Battle Outcomes**:  
     - Winner of first round starts second round with one Battle Token.  
     - Winner of second round wins the tile.  
     - If no second-round combat occurs:  
       - If unattacked: tile is discarded; Main Defender places 2 cubes in the controlling city.  
       - If only one side has units: that side wins tile (if attacker) or gets 2 cubes (if defender).  
   - **Casualties**:  
     - Loser of a round loses one unit.  
     - Must come from Main force if possible; lowest value.  
     - If no Main units, from Allied force (Main player chooses).  
   - **Special Cases** (from Attack Summary):  
     - Attacker Hoplite vs. No Defender: Attacker wins tile.  
     - Defender Hoplite/Trireme vs. No Attacker: Defender gets 2 cubes; tile removed.  
     - Attacker Trireme vs. Defender Trireme: Fight first round; Defender gets 2 cubes; no tile awarded.  
     - Attacker Hoplite vs. Defender Trireme: Defender wins first, Attacker wins second → Attacker wins tile.  
     - Attacker Hoplite vs. Defender Hoplite: Two rounds; winner of second round wins tile (must win both rounds).  
     - Complex battles with multiple units follow two-round structure with Battle Token carryover.

7. **End of Turn**  
   - Flip all Leader counters to Statue side and place in Statue Area by their city.  
   - Discard all Influence Tiles.  
   - Return surviving military counters to their cities.  
   - Check for game end: if Athens or Sparta has 4+ defeat counters, game ends.  
   - Otherwise, begin next turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Influence Placement**: Driven by Influence Tiles; determines political control.  
- **Elections**: Based on influence; winner loses cubes equal to opponent’s total.  
- **Military Deployment**: Ordered by Influence Tile shard value; allows strategic commitment.  
- **Combat**: Two-phase (Hoplite/Trireme), with first-round winner gaining advantage.  
- **Battle Tokens**: Used to track round victories; first to 2 wins the round.  
- **Casualties**: Loser of each round loses one unit (Main force preferred).  
- **Special Tiles**: One-time effects (e.g., Alcibiades, Brasidas, Plague) with specific timing.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**Game End Conditions**:  
- After 3 turns.  
- OR immediately if Athens or Sparta suffers 4 defeats.

**Scoring**:  
- **1 VP per influence cube** in cities.  
- **VPs equal to value** on each Location Tile won.  
- **1 VP per statue**, worth the highest uncovered number on the city’s VP track (defeats cover highest numbers).

**Tiebreakers**:  
1. Most VPs from Location Tiles.  
2. Most Statues.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **No Attackers/Defenders**: Tile removed, no cubes awarded.  
- **Only Defender Present**: Tile removed; Main Defender places 2 cubes in controlling city.  
- **Only Attacker Present**: Attacker wins tile (if Hoplite); Trireme alone does nothing.  
- **Persians**: Controlled by player with no city leadership. Shared if multiple such players. No casualties; all units return after battle.  
- **Assassin Effect**: Can remove own or opponent’s cube; if α space is emptied, β moves to α.  
- **Special Tile Timing**:  
  - Alcibiades, Perikles: During Influence Tile phase.  
  - Brasidas, Thessalian Allies: Before Hoplite combat.  
  - Phormio, Persian Fleet: Before Trireme combat.  
  - Plague: During player’s turn in Influence phase.  
  - Slave Revolt: During player’s turn in Commit Forces phase.  
- **Battle Token Advantage**: Cannot be stacked; cannot use Special Tile to gain automatic victory if already advantaged.  
- **Multiple Cities Controlled**: Player can attack with one city and defend with another against same enemy.  
- **Intrinsic Units**: Always fight if no player units; never count as casualties.
