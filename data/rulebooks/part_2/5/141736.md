## SAIL TO INDIA — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Sail to India*, players take on the roles of Portuguese nobles during the Age of Discovery, supporting explorers in their quest to find a sea route to India. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) through exploration, trade, building construction, and technological advancement.

The game ends when either the last coastal town (India) is discovered or two or more players run out of markers in their stock. After the triggering player finishes their turn, all other players take one final turn before final scoring.

The player with the most VP wins. Tiebreakers:  
1. Player who discovered India  
2. Player with the most wealth  
3. Player with the most VP on their Historian card  
If still tied, players share the win.

    - Movement must end there  
    - Reveal the card: gain 1 VP

  - After moving, optionally convert any number of ships into trade goods by placing them on empty trade good spaces on the town above

- **Sell Trade Goods**  
  - Return any number of your trade good markers to Lisboa  
  - Gain wealth and VP based on number of **different types** of goods sold:

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I move more than one ship to a face-down town?**  
  No. You may only **discover one town per turn**, so only one ship may move into a face-down town per turn.

- **Can I use a marketplace without selling any goods?**  
  No. You must return at least one trade good marker to Lisboa to trigger a sale.

- **What happens if I gain wealth but have no marker in Lisboa to make a banker?**  
  Surplus wealth is lost. You must have a marker available in Lisboa to represent additional wealth.

- **Can I use multiple "once per turn" techs in one turn?**  
  Yes. Each "once per turn" ability can be used once per turn, even if multiple are owned.

- **Can I launch ships from a stronghold I own?**  
  Yes. Strongholds act as secondary launch points—move markers directly from Lisboa to your stronghold’s sea area.

- **Can I return a scientist or ship builder to Lisboa?**  
  No. Only markers on buildings, trade goods, ships, bankers, and historians can be returned.

- **Do I lose VP if I can’t place a historian?**  
  Yes. If you gain VP but have no marker available in Lisboa, surplus VP is lost.
