### 1. Lore & Objective

**Lore**  
In the age before the Void consumed the Old World, heroes of diverse races—humans, elves, dwarves, and gnomes—formed unbreakable alliances to descend into the deep dungeons beneath the earth. These Dungeon Alliances sought knowledge, treasure, and glory, often competing fiercely with rival parties even as they battled the monstrous denizens of the dark. This was an era where the sacred oath between allies meant everything.

**Objective**  
The goal of *Dungeon Alliance* is to earn the most Experience Points (XP) by the end of the game. XP is gained primarily by defeating monsters, resolving quests, and interacting with challenges. All XP tokens—both face-up and face-down—count toward the final score. In competitive play, the player with the highest total XP wins. In solo or cooperative play, victory may also depend on completing specific quests based on difficulty level.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### Hero Activation Actions
- **Move + Move**  
- **Rest (Heal 3 HP) + Move**  
- **Move + Attack (+ Pet)**  
- **Attack A + Attack B (+ Pet)**  
- **Leave Dungeon (if defeated): Heal all HP, move to Starting Tile**

#### Movement
- Spend 1 Speed to move 1 space (including diagonally).  
- Pay 1 extra Speed to leave space adjacent to enemy.  
- Free spin in place allowed at any time before attack.

#### Doors & Chests
- **Normal Door**: 1 Speed to open.  
- **Locked Door / Secret Door / Locked Chest**:  
  - Spend 1 Speed to attempt.  
  - Roll Dungeon Die ≥ Dungeon Level.  
  - Spend extra Speed to add +1 per point to roll.  
  - Guaranteed success: Spend $1 + \text{Dungeon Level}$ Speed.

#### Traps
- **Revealing**: Hero adjacent to open door may spend 1 Speed to reveal Challenge Token in adjacent room (if no enemies present).  
- **Disarming**: Roll ≥ Dungeon Level; can spend Speed to boost roll.  
- **Triggering**: Entering room with face-down Challenge Token reveals and triggers trap immediately.

#### Combat
1. **Determine Range & Line of Sight**  
   - Melee: Adjacent, any direction.  
   - Ranged: 2–3 spaces away, line of sight (imaginary line from center to center, not blocked by walls/closed doors).

2. **Determine Attack Strength**  
   - Base Attack (from card or hero) + Bonuses from played cards.  
   - Attack Spells provide base attack; count as hero’s attack.

3. **Determine Damage**  
   - Damage = Attack Total – Defense Total.  
   - Defense types: Armor, Dodge, Obstruction (+1 per intervening character).  
   - If attack ≤ defense, no damage.

4. **Apply Damage**  
   - To monster: Place Wound Tokens (colored) beneath token.  
   - To hero: Place cardboard Wound Tokens on Hero Card.  
   - Poison damage uses green tokens.

#### Card Play
- Only one card of each **type** per hero per round unless:  
  - Burst of Strength used.  
  - Card text allows multiple.  
- **Enhance Spells** can target allies; only one per hero per round unless Burst of Strength.  
- **Reaction Cards** can be played during Monster Activation.

#### Burst of Strength

  - +1 Speed  
  - +1 Attack (melee or ranged)  
  - Remove 1 Wound Token  
  - Play same card type twice (e.g., two Action cards)  
- Only one Burst of Strength per hero per round.

#### Drafting Upgrades
- After movement/attack, may draft 1 card from Upgrade Draft Area.  
- Must be usable by at least one hero in alliance.  
- Pay XP equal to card cost (flipped face down).  
- Move Draft Token forward on Bonus Chart.  
- Replace drafted card from deck.
