## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Agents of SMERSH is a cooperative game where players portray UN Secret Service spies attempting to stop Dr. Lobo and his terrorist organization SMERSH International from achieving world domination. SMERSH, originally a Soviet counter-intelligence agency, was reformed by Dr. Lobo after its dissolution.

**Victory Conditions (achieve any one):**
- Advance the Location Intelligence Track to its required threshold (5 for 3–5 players, 4 for 2 players, 3 for 1 player) AND have Intel in the Intel Pool that matches or exceeds the symbols on Dr. Lobo’s track.
- Defeat all four Henchmen (Darling, Mr. Big, Fedor, Pierre) by defeating each at Level 3. This triggers an immediate win regardless of Intel or Location Track status.
  
**Loss Conditions (any one triggers loss):**
- Dr. Lobo’s Villain Track reaches "9".
- The Location Intelligence Track reaches its end but the Intel Pool does not contain enough matching Intel to Dr. Lobo’s track.

- May spend 1 Resolve to:
  - Add +1 to test total (before rolling), or
  - Reroll one die (only if not used for +1).
- Roll all drawn dice + Yellow Die (always rolled).
- Success if Gun symbols ≥ required (usually 1, sometimes [2]).
- Apply all Heal/Injury results before Pass/Fail outcome.
- Max 1 Resolve spent per turn on dice manipulation.

#### Dice Ratios
- Black: 4 Success, 1 Double Injury
- Red: 3 Success
- Green: 3 Success, 2 Single Injury
- Blue: 2 Success
- Brown: 1 Success
- Yellow (Grey Die): 1 Success, 1 Single Injury, 1 Heal, 3 Failures

#### Injuries

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **End Triggers:**
  - Location Track reaches threshold → flip all Intel Pool → compare to Dr. Lobo’s track → win if match, lose if not.
  - All 4 Henchmen defeated → immediate win.
  - Dr. Lobo reaches 9 → immediate loss.
- **Intel Matching:** Pool must contain at least the number and type of symbols shown on Dr. Lobo’s current track space.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Henchman Encounter in Book/Card Encounter:** Do not advance Location Track, but Henchman still levels up. If defeated at Level 3, remove.
- **Intel Overflow:** Remove all board Intel and excess Location Tokens (keep one). Check after all End of Turn Events.
- **No Available Status Card:** If rewarded and unavailable, gain Top Secret Card or Resolve (positive), or lower any Basic Skill (negative).
- **Rerolling Injuries:** Only final roll counts. Rerolling Injury removes it unless rerolled again.
- **Resting in Regional Areas/Islands:** Not allowed. Must move out next turn.
- **Multiple Tokens:** Only one resolved per turn.
- **Dr. Lobo Negative Track:** Possible. Cards are kept next to track to track net value.
