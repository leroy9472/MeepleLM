### 4. Gameplay Flow (Per Round)  
Each round consists of six phases:

#### 1. Bidding  
- The player with the **leader token** places the expedition figure at the start of their chosen path and announces a bid (in adventure cards) and destination.  
- Bidding proceeds clockwise. Each player may:  
  - **Pass**, or  
  - Make a **higher bid** than the current highest.  
- A higher bid on a **different path** moves the expedition figure to that path’s start.  
- Bidding ends when all players pass after a bid.  
- The **highest bidder** wins:  
  - Becomes the new expedition leader.  
  - Takes the leader token.  
  - Discards adventure cards equal to their bid.  

**Special Rules**:  
- A player who bids **4 or more** may play an **Ovetos** card to end bidding immediately.  
- A player may play a **Juju** card on another player during bidding, preventing them from further participation.  
- Players may re-enter bidding after passing.  
- A player cannot bid more than they can pay (but need not reveal cards).  
- **Air travel** (Drako/Zeppelin) cannot start with a 0 bid.  

**Card Types & Movement**:

**Air Travel Rules**:  
- Announce any destination site.  
- Expedition does **not** move from current site until Movement phase.  
- Requires at least 1 Drako or Zeppelin.  
- Cannot bid 0 as first bid.  

#### 2. Moving  
- Move the expedition figure to the **destination site**.  
- Place the **lowest-numbered available exploration marker** on that site.  
  - **Exception**: Do **not** place a marker if returning to **Base Camp**.

  - Only **two sea tokens** exist; no more are used after both are placed.  

**Sangaia Card (Optional Play)**:  
- Any player may play a **Sangaia** card after movement:  
  - If movement was **not by air**:  
    - Expedition moves again on a **different path of the same type** (e.g., jungle → jungle).  
    - Do **not** place a marker at intermediate site.  
  - If movement was **by air**:  
    - Expedition moves to **any neighboring site** of the original destination.  
  - Cannot play Sangaia if no valid second path exists.  

#### 3. Being Cursed  
- Any player holding a **curse card** matching the current site **must play it faceup** with their gold and treasures.  
- Curse remains in play and contributes negative points at endgame.  

#### 4. Finding Treasures  
- Any player holding a **treasure card** for the current site may play it **faceup** next to their gold.  
  - May play **multiple treasure cards** for the same site.

  - Worth +3 points.  
- **Bongo Card**:  
  - Discard a Bongo card to play **1 treasure card** for a **neighboring site**.  
  - Neighboring = directly connected by **land, river, or lake** (not sea).  

#### 5. Receiving Cable News

  - **Round 4**: Each player draws 2 treasure cards, keeps 1, discards 1.

  2. **Optionally buy 1 additional card** for **1 gold**.

- If the adventure deck runs out, **shuffle the discard pile** to form a new deck.  
- After drawing, any player with **more than 10 adventure cards** must **discard down to 10**.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Bolt Symbol Cards (Immediate Effect)  
When drawn (faceup or facedown), discard immediately and resolve effect:  
- **Makaks**: Steal a random adventure card from another player.  
- **Bigfoot**: Place or move Bigfoot figure to block **any jungle, mountain, or sand path**. Expedition cannot use it.  
- **Leviathan**: Place or move Leviathan figure to block **any water path**.  
- **Antik**: Draw 2 treasure cards; keep 1, place other at bottom of deck.  
- **Istwa**: Draw a destiny card; keep it (discarding current) or discard it. Place discarded card at bottom of deck.  
- **Marabout**: Steal a random treasure card from another player’s hand (not played ones).  
- **Diawas**: Shuffle deck, discard pile, and faceup cards together. Reveal 4 new faceup cards. Draw 1 card (from faceup or deck).  
- **Panda**: Choose 2 players (including self); each discards 3 adventure cards.  
- **Samedi**: Choose 2 players; each draws 1 curse card and adds it to hand.  

#### Alternative Cooperative Bidding (Optional Rule)  
- Players may **add to an existing bid** instead of making a new one.  
- Multiple players can contribute to the **same shared bid**.  
- Once part of a shared bid, a player **cannot bid on another path**.  
- If total bid reaches **4 or more**, a player may play **Ovetos** to end bidding.  
- **Juju** prevents target from adding to shared bid, but their prior contribution stands.  
- Move expedition to path with **highest total bid**.  
- Winning bidder (or group) pays total bid collectively.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends after the **16th exploration marker** is placed and the round completes.  

**Final Scoring**:  
Each player scores:  
- **+1 point per gold coin** remaining.  
- **Points for each treasure card** played faceup (value on card).  
- **+3 points** for each **Bonus card** played.  
- **Points from destiny card** (fulfilled condition; e.g., "Visit 3 jungle sites").  
- **Negative points** for each **curse card** played (value on card).  

The player with the **highest total score** wins.
