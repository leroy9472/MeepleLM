## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   Players guide their civilizations through history by advancing in Knowledge, Construction, Military, and Government. The goal is to build the most successful civilization by accumulating Victory Points (VP) through production icons, investor bonuses, and end-game scoring effects. The game ends when "The Future" card enters play, triggering final scoring.

2. **Components**  
   - 67 Civilization Cards (divided into Ages A, I–V and S)  
   - 72 Resource Tokens (RT)  
   - 5 Player Markers (colored)  
   - 5 Reference Cards  
   - 1 Rulebook  

3. **Setup**  
   1. **Prepare the Civilization Deck**:  
      - Separate cards by age (A, I–V, S).  
      - Place "The Future" card face down; place "The Internet" on top.  
      - Shuffle remaining cards of each age into separate face-down stacks.  
      - Stack Age V on "The Internet", then IV, III, II, I (oldest on top). This forms the Civilization Deck.  
   2. **Form the Market**:  
      - Reveal all 5 Age A cards face up to form the initial Market.  
      - In a 5-player game, reveal one additional Age I card.  
   3. **Distribute Starting Items**:  
      - Each player takes:  
        - 1 player marker  
        - 1 reference card (matching color)  
        - 4 resource tokens  
      - These form the player's Nation (open information).  
   4. **Deal Starting Cards**:  
      - Randomly deal one Age S (Government) card to each player.  
      - Unused S cards return to the box.  
   5. **Form the Reserve**:  
      - Place all remaining resource tokens beside the play area.  
   6. **Set the Supply**:  
      - Supply starts empty.  
   7. **Determine Starting Player**:  
      - Randomly choose first player; play proceeds clockwise.

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   Each turn consists of two phases:  
   **Action Phase → Cleanup Phase**

   **Action Phase (Choose 1 Action)**  
   1. **Invest**  
      - Cannot invest if already invested or has 0 RT.  
      - Choose an uninvested Market card.  
      - Place your marker and ≥1 RT under it.  

   2. **Complete**  
      - Must have an invested card.  
      - Move all RT from your invested card to the Supply.  
      - Check investor bonus indicator (magnifying glass icon).  
      - Count matching production icons in your Nation (excluding the card being completed).  
      - Take that many RT from the Supply (if available).  
      - Take the card and place it in your Nation:  
        - Stack with same-type cards (newest on top; only top effect active).  
        - Wonders and Leaders: not stacked.  
      - Activate Instant, Attack, or Attack All effects immediately.  

   3. **Snipe**  
      - Can only snipe if you have ≥ RT than the amount under the card.  
      - Pay the investor the same amount of RT they placed.  
      - Move all RT from under the card to the Supply.  
      - Investor:  
        - Takes RT equal to their Trade icons from Supply.  
        - Then takes ⌊½ Supply⌋ RT from Supply.  
      - Take the card and place in your Nation (same stacking rules).  
      - Activate Instant, Attack, or Attack All effects immediately.  
      - *No investor bonus is awarded.*  

   4. **Activate (Turn Action Effect)**  
      - Activate a card in your Nation with a Turn Action effect.  
      - If the effect grants a card, resolve it and activate any Instant/Attack effects.  
      - The activating card may be removed (e.g., Leaders).  

   5. **Harvest**  
      - Count Harvest icons in your Nation.  
      - Add that many RT from Reserve to Supply.  
      - Take ⌊½ Supply⌋ RT from Supply.  
      - If your RT < Current Age:  
        - Take from Supply to match Current Age.  
        - If Supply insufficient, take remainder from Reserve.  

   **Cleanup Phase**  
   1. **Replenish Market**:  
      - Reveal cards from Civilization Deck to restore Market to:  
        - 5 cards (3–4 players)  
        - 6 cards (5 players)  
   2. **Age Check**:  
      - Discard non-invested Market cards that are 2+ ages older than Current Age.  
      - Replenish Market after discarding.  
      - *Invested cards are safe from Age Check.*  
   3. **End Game Check**:  
      - If "The Future" card is in Market or owned by any player, game ends after this turn.  
      - Otherwise, next player takes a turn.

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Production Icons** (7 types):  
     - Culture, Harvest, Trade, Attack, Science, Defense, Industry  
     - Provided by card production stripes and permanent effects.  
     - Used for scoring, investor bonuses, and action requirements.  
   - **Card Types & Stacking**:  
     - Military, Construction, Knowledge, Government: stacked; only top card's effect active.  
     - Leader: only one allowed; new Leader replaces old (discard old).  
     - Wonder: not stacked; all effects and icons always active.  
   - **Effect Timing**:
     - **Instant**: Activate once upon gaining card.  
     - **Attack**: Activate once; target one opponent with lower military strength (Attack only).  
     - **Attack All**: Activate once; affect all opponents with lower military strength.  
     - **Permanent**: Active while top of stack; may be obsolete at end game.  
     - **Turn Action**: Activate during your turn as an action.  
     - **End Game Scoring**: Activate only during final scoring.  
   - **Military Strength**:  
     - For Attack/Attack All: attacker uses only Attack icons.  
     - Defender’s strength = Attack + Defense icons.  
   - **Investor Bonus**:  
     - Only awarded via **Complete** action.  
     - Based on production icons in Nation *before* adding the card.  
     - Cannot take RT from Reserve if Supply insufficient.  
   - **Reserve vs. Supply**:  
     - **Reserve**: Source of RT; used only for:  
       - Harvest action (adding to Supply)  
       - Replenishing RT to match Current Age  
       - Card effects that specify "Reserve"  
     - **Supply**: Central pool; RT from investments and Snipe payouts go here.  
     - *Never take from Reserve to fulfill investor bonuses or Snipe payouts.*

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   Trigger: When "The Future" enters Market or is gained.  
   Final Scoring Steps:  
   1. **Deactivate Obsolete Effects**:  
      - Any card with obsolete icon (⊘): effect turned off.  
      - Production icons still count.  
   2. **Base Icon Scoring**:  
      - Each **Culture** icon = 1 VP  
      - All other icons (Harvest, Trade, Attack, Science, Defense, Industry):  
        - Total count; every 2 = 1 VP (⌊total/2⌋)  
   3. **End Game Scoring Effects**:  
      - Activate all cards with End Game Scoring timing.  
      - Each Culture icon gained = 1 VP  
   4. **Sum Total VP**  
   5. **Tiebreakers**:  
      - Most cards in Nation → wins  
      - Still tied? Most resource tokens → wins  

   Example:  
   - 7 Culture icons = 7 VP  
   - 23 non-Culture icons = 11 VP  
   - "Einstein" (2 Knowledge cards) = 2 VP  
   - "Great Mosque" (4 Government cards) = 4 VP  
   - "Great Wall" (3 Defense icons → ⌊3/2⌋ = 1 VP)  
   - Total = 25 VP  

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **No Target for Effect?**  
     - If no legal target (e.g., no opponent with lower military strength), do nothing.  
   - **Insufficient Supply for Bonus?**  
     - Take only what’s available. Cannot take from Reserve.  
   - **Gaining Cards via Effects (e.g., Activate)**:  
     - Must resolve Instant, Attack, Attack All effects immediately.  
   - **Current Age**:  
     - Highest age among Market cards and player-owned cards.  
     - Used in Harvest and Age Check.  
   - **Discarding/Removing Cards**:  
     - Discarded cards are removed from game (not shuffled back).  
   - **Harvest with 0 Harvest Icons**:  
     - Still take ⌊½ Supply⌋, then replenish to Current Age if needed.
