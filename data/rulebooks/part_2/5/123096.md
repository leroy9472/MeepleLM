### 1. Lore & Objective
In Mission 1: Repair Satellite Zaragoza, your ship is sent to repair the failing communications satellite Zaragoza-12 in the remote Asunción region. Upon arrival, you discover four lifeless pirate cruisers near the satellite, one emitting a distress signal. Your initial mission is to repair the satellite. However, when enemy pirates arrive to respond to the distress call, your objective shifts to destroying the pirate ships. Success in this mission may help restore your tarnished career.

### 2. Components
- Player starship with station components (Captain, Helm, Sensors, Engineering, Shields, Weapons, Tractor Beam, Jump Drive, Damage Control)
- Map tiles arranged in a 3×3 grid
- Satellite (S) token
- Pirate cruiser (P) tokens
- Enemy ship cards and tokens
- Sand timer and Captain’s Log
- Damage, Repair, and Core Breach decks
- Jump Flux cards
- Experimental Equipment cards
- Various station-specific tiles, tokens, and cards (e.g., Tractor Beam tiles, Sensor tiles, Maneuver cards)

### 3. Setup
- Place the satellite (S) in the center of a 3×3 grid of sectors.
- Pirate cruiser hulks are nearby but pose no hazard and do not need to be placed on the map.
- Set ship starting speed to 3.
- Place the Nemesis marker at position 5 on the track.
- On turn 2, place 3 (or 4 if playing on hard difficulty) pirate ships (P) on the right edge of the map during Step 7. These pirates immediately gain a lock on your ship and move to attack.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Step 1 (3 min)**: Discussion and energy distribution. Captain leads strategy.
2. **Step 2**: Preparation. Stations set up based on energy (e.g., Helm draws maneuver cards, Shields draw shield tiles).
3. **Step 3 (30 sec)**: Action phase. Helm plots movement, Shields place tiles, Sensors match shapes, Weapons solve puzzles, Engineering matches tiles.
4. **Step 4**: Resolution. Ship moves, shields are set, sensor locks are applied.
5. **Step 5 (30 sec)**: Tractor Beam attempts to repair satellite or capture targets.
6. **Step 6 (30 sec)**: Weapons fire torpedoes at enemies.
7. **Step 7**: Enemy Action. Pirates move, gain lock, and fire. Nemesis marker moves.
8. **Step 8 (30 sec)**: Jump attempt (if applicable).
9. **Step 9 (30 sec)**: Repair ongoing damage or attempt core breach repair.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Satellite Repair**: To repair the satellite, the ship must be in the same square as the satellite, shields must be down, and the Tractor Beam Officer must match the ship's speed + 2 in Tractor Beam points.
- **Pirate Attack**: Pirates arrive on turn 2. If destroyed before satellite repair, the repair is assumed complete.
- **Boarding Parties**: Enemy ships with boarding ability may send boarding parties if:
  - Enemy is within 4 spaces.
  - At least one shield is down.
  - Boarding parties cannot beam through rifts.
- **Boarding Resolution**:
  - Entry point depends on the downed shield and proximity to attacker.
  - Boarding party moves one station clockwise each turn during Step 3.
  - If they reach Engineering: Core breach occurs.
  - If they reach the Captain: No discussion phase, no experimental equipment, no optional rules, and all players shift stations randomly.
- **Step 3 Boarding Defense**: Officer in the affected station rolls 3d6, re-rolling non-6s once:
  - One 6: Officer performs duty; boarders may move.
  - Two 6s: Officer returns to station; boarders cannot move.
  - Three 6s: Officer returns to station; boarders are eliminated.
- **Security Teams**: Damage Control Officer may spend power to send security teams, giving the defending officer an extra d6 in Step 3.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Victory Conditions**:
  - Destroy all pirate ships.
  - Optionally, repair the satellite (automatic if pirates are destroyed first).
- **Failure Conditions**:
  - Core breach not repaired by end of Step 3.
  - Ship destroyed by damage.
- **Mission Failure**: If the mission fails, the crew may jump out to save themselves. Another ship may be dispatched to retry or continue the campaign.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Boarding Party Movement**: If a boarding party is already aboard, it moves one station clockwise during Step 3, regardless of player seating.
- **Jumping with Boarders Aboard**: If the Jump Drive Officer jumps while enemies are aboard, continue playing until Step 3 to stop invaders and resolve core breach. Other ship functions are ignored.
- **Tie in Entry Point**: If port and starboard shields are down and equidistant to attacker, the Captain chooses the entry point.
- **Satellite Repair After Combat**: If pirates are destroyed first, satellite repair is assumed and does not need to be played out (unless the Tractor Beam Officer insists).
