## Catan Junior – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In Catan Junior, players take on the role of young pirates exploring a chain of islands filled with resources and treasures. Guided by Coco the parrot, players build pirates’ lairs and ships to expand their presence across the islands. The looming threat of the Ghost Captain adds tension—he blocks resource production when stationed on an island.  

**Objective**: Be the first player to build all 7 of your pirates’ lairs. A lair on Spooky Island (the Ghost Captain’s fortress) counts toward this total.

### 3. Setup  
1. **Choose board side**:  
   - 2 players: use side with 2 turtle isles  
   - 3–4 players: use side with 4 turtle isles  

2. **Place resource tiles**:  
   - Sort resource tiles into 5 piles (cutlasses, goats, wood, gold, molasses).  
   - Place one tile of each type on the 5 marketplace booths.  

3. **Prepare Coco Tiles**:  
   - Shuffle thoroughly and place face-up (Coco side) next to the board.  

4. **Place Ghost Captain**:  
   - Start on Spooky Island.  

5. **Place die**:  
   - Next to the board.  

6. **Choose color and take pieces**:  
   - Each player selects a color and takes:  
     - 7 pirates’ lairs  
     - 8 ships  
   - Unused white pieces (in 3-player game) return to the box.  

7. **Place starting pieces**:  
   - Place 1 pirates’ lair on each of the two colored starting lair-sites of your color.  
   - Place 1 ship on the adjacent ship-site of your color (marked with dotted line).  
   - Place remaining 5 lairs and 7 ships in front of you as supply.  

8. **Place building costs tile**:  
   - In front of you, face up.  

9. **Initial resources**:  
   - Each player receives 1 wood and 1 molasses tile from the stockpile.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in clockwise order, starting with the youngest. Each turn follows this sequence:

1. **Roll the Die**  
2. **Distribute Resources** (based on roll)  
3. **Build and/or Trade** (in any order)  
4. **End Turn and Pass Die**

---

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Roll the Die  
- On your turn, roll the die.  
- **If result is 1–5**:  
  - Each player with a pirates’ lair adjacent to an island showing the rolled number receives 1 matching resource tile from the stockpile.  
  - The active player distributes these resources.  
- **If result is 6**:  
  - No resources are distributed.  
  - The active player **moves the Ghost Captain** to any island of their choice.  
  - Then, they take **2 resource tiles** of the type produced by the island where the Ghost Captain is now placed.  

> ⚠️ While the Ghost Captain occupies an island, **no player receives resources** from that island—even if they have adjacent lairs—when its number is rolled.

---

#### Build  
You may build during your turn after rolling. You can perform multiple actions as long as you have resources.

##### Pirates’ Lair  
- Cost: 1 cutlass, 1 molasses, 1 goat, 1 wood  
- Can only be built on an **empty lair-site**  
- Must be **adjacent to one of your ships**  

##### Ship  
- Cost: 1 goat, 1 wood  
- Can only be built on an **empty ship-site**  
- Must be **adjacent to one of your pirates’ lairs**  

##### Building Rules  
- You **must alternate** between building a ship and a pirates’ lair.  
  - Example: If your last build was a ship, your next must be a pirates’ lair (if possible).  
- You **cannot build past** another player’s lair or ship.  
- You **cannot share** a ship-site with another player.

---

#### Buy Coco Tiles  
- Cost: 1 cutlass, 1 molasses, 1 gold  
- On your turn, you may buy a Coco tile from the top of the stack.  
- Immediately **reveal and resolve** the back-side effect:  
  - **Move the Ghost Captain as if you rolled a 6** (move to any island; take 2 resources from that island)  
  - **Build a pirates’ lair or a ship for free** (follow normal placement rules)  
  - **Receive 4 resources**: 1 cutlass, 1 goat, 1 wood, 1 molasses  

- After use, place the tile in front of you, **Coco side up**, to track ownership.  

##### Pirates’ Lair in the Castle (Spooky Island)  
- The player with the **most Coco tiles** places one of their unused pirates’ lairs on Spooky Island.  
- If there is a tie for most Coco tiles, **no one** controls Spooky Island.  
- If a player gains the sole lead, they immediately place a lair on Spooky Island.  
- If a tie forms later, the current occupant **removes** their lair.  
- The lair on Spooky Island **counts toward the 7 needed to win**.

---

#### Trade  

##### Marketplace Trade (once per turn)  
- Take **one** resource tile from any booth.  
- In return, place **one** of your resource tiles on that booth.  
- Always maintains 5 face-up tiles.  

> **Market Reset Rule**:  
> - If **5 tiles of the same type** appear in the marketplace:  
>   - Remove all 5 from the game.  
>   - Refill the marketplace with one of each resource (from stockpile).  

##### Stockpile Trade (unlimited)  
- Trade **2 of the same resource** to the stockpile to receive **1 of any other resource**.  
- Example: 2 goats → 1 wood  

##### Advanced Rule: Player Trading (Optional)  
- Players may trade directly with each other **only on the active player’s turn**.  
- The active player proposes trades.  
- Other players may accept or decline.  
- No trading between non-active players at any time.  
- The marketplace is **not used** when this rule is in effect.

---

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- There is **no scoring**—the game ends immediately when a player places their **7th pirates’ lair**.  
- This includes the lair on Spooky Island (if controlled).  
- That player **wins immediately**.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: What happens if I roll a 6 but the Ghost Captain is already on an island I want?**  
A: You may still move him—even to the same island. Then take 2 resources from that island.

**Q: Can I build a free structure from a Coco tile even if I can’t afford it?**  
A: Yes. The free build ignores cost, but must follow placement rules (adjacency, alternation).

**Q: Can I buy multiple Coco tiles in one turn?**  
A: Yes, as long as you can pay (1 cutlass, 1 molasses, 1 gold per tile).

**Q: What if the stockpile runs out of a resource?**  
A: No more of that resource can be taken until some are returned (via trade or game effects).

**Q: Does the Ghost Captain block resources from Spooky Island?**  
A: Yes. If Spooky Island has a number and the Ghost Captain is there, no one gets resources when that number is rolled.

**Q: Can I move the Ghost Captain via Coco tile to an island with my lairs to block opponents?**  
A: Yes. But you also block yourself from getting resources from that island.
