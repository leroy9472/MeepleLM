### 1. Lore & Objective

In *Pastiche*, players step into the role of artists recreating famous masterpieces by mixing colors to match the palettes used in iconic European and American paintings from the past six centuries. The term "pastiche" refers to an imitation or homage to an earlier work, and in this game, players honor the masters by reconstructing the color schemes of their works.

**Objective:**  
The goal is to score the most points by completing commission cards (representing famous paintings), earning artist bonus points for completing two works by the same artist, and maximizing the value of usable palette cards held at the end of the game.

  - Artist bonus points (earned when both of an artist’s commissions are completed)
  - A palette of 2–7 color "dabs" needed to complete the commission

- **131 Palette Cards**  
  Color cards used to fulfill commissions, categorized by type and point value:
  - **Primaries** (4 pts): Red, Yellow, Blue (8 of each)
  - **Secondaries** (1 pt): Orange, Green, Violet, Brown (12 of each)
  - **Tertiaries** (2 pts): Amber, Scarlet, Olive, Teal, Magenta, Purple (6 of each)

- **54 Palette Hexes**  
  Hexagonal tiles used to generate palette cards. Each has:
  - A center marking: one or two primary colors (red, yellow, blue)

### 3. Setup

#### General Setup:
1. Place the **Three-Hex Starting Piece** in the center of the play area.
2. Place the **Palette Board** nearby with all **Palette Cards** sorted and stacked face-up in their designated spots (this is the palette bank).
3. Shuffle the **Palette Hexes** and place them face-down in a draw pile.
4. Shuffle the **Commission Cards**. Deal **4 face-up** above the play area—this is the **Gallery**. Place the rest face-down as a draw deck.

#### Player Setup:
Randomly choose a starting player and give them the **Starting Player Card**. Each player receives:
- 2 random **Commission Cards** (placed on easels; kept secret)
- 2 random **Palette Hexes** (face-down)
- 1 each of the **Secondary Palette Cards**: Green, Violet, Orange, Brown (1-point cards)
- 1 **Player Reference Card**

Players keep their commission cards, palette cards, and hexes secret unless playing casually.

### 4. Gameplay Flow

A round proceeds clockwise. Each player’s turn consists of **three phases**:

#### A. Mixing Phase
- **Place a Hex**:  
  Place one of your palette hexes adjacent to the starting piece or any previously placed hex.
- **Collect Palette Cards** (choose **one** method):
  1. **Mix Dabs**:  
     Combine the "dabs" (small color dots) on the corners of your placed hex with adjacent hexes. For each group of **two or three adjacent dabs** of **different** primary colors, mix them using the color chart to earn a palette card.  
     - Two identical primary dabs → no card  
     - Three identical primary dabs → one **Primary** palette card (4 pts)  
  2. **Take Center Color**:  
     Take **one** primary color card shown in the center of the hex. If two are shown, choose one.

#### B. Painting Phase (actions may be done in any order, as often as desired, except where limited)
- **Trade Palette Cards**:
  - **With Other Players**: Freely trade palette cards (not commissions); the active player must be involved.
  - **With the Palette Bank**:
    - 3 of the same color → 1 Black, White, Secondary, or Tertiary (cannot get Primary, Bisque, or Gray this way)
    - 1 Yellow + 1 Brown → 1 Bisque
    - 1 Black + 1 White → 1 Gray
    - 1 Primary + 1 any card → 1 different Primary (used to switch primary colors)
- **Trade One Commission Card**:  
  Swap **one** of your commission cards with **one** from the Gallery (only once per turn).
- **Complete Commission(s)**:  
  - Spend matching palette cards to complete **any commission** (yours or in the Gallery).
  - Reveal the palette cards used, return them to the bank.
  - Place the completed commission face-up in front of you.
  - Draw a new commission card to maintain 2 in hand.

#### C. Clean-up Phase
- **Hand Limit**: Discard down to **8 palette cards** if necessary. Excess cards go back to the bank.
- **Draw a Hex**: Draw one palette hex to replenish your hand to **2 hexes**.
- **End Turn**: Play passes to the next player.

### 5. Core Mechanics

- **Color Mixing**:
  - Based on combining primary color dabs (red, yellow, blue) on adjacent hex corners.
  - Use the **color chart** on the reference card to determine resulting colors.
  - Examples:
    - Red + Yellow → Orange
    - Blue + Yellow → Green
    - Red + Blue → Violet
    - Red + Yellow + Blue → Brown
    - Three Red dabs → Red (Primary, 4 pts)

- **Hex Placement Strategy**:
  - Maximize color combinations
  - Block opponents from forming three-of-a-kind dabs
  - Position for future flexibility

- **Trading**:
  - Bank trades allow conversion of surplus cards.
  - Player trades are unrestricted but require mutual agreement.

- **Commission Completion**:
  - Must match **all** color dabs on a commission card.
  - Can complete commissions from hand or Gallery.
  - Always draw a replacement to keep 2 commissions in hand.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

#### Game End Trigger:
- Game ends at the end of the round when **one player** reaches:
  - **2 players**: 45 commission points
  - **3 players**: 40 commission points
  - **4 players**: 35 commission points  
  All players finish the round so everyone has equal turns.

#### Final Scoring:
Each player totals:
1. **Completed Commission Cards**: Sum of all commission point values.
2. **Usable Palette Cards**:  
   - Only cards in hand that can be used to complete **in-hand commission cards**.
   - Each card counts once, even if multiple commissions need it.
   - Example: If you have 3 green cards but only 1 commission needs green, only 1 green card scores.
3. **Artist Bonus Points**:  
   - Earned for completing **both** commissions of the same artist.
   - Bonus based on **combined point value** of the two commissions:
     - 15–17 pts → +3
     - 18–22 pts → +4
     - 23–27 pts → +5
     - 28–31 pts → +6
   - Awarded once per artist pair.

#### Final Score =  
Completed Commissions + Usable Palette Cards + Artist Bonuses

#### Tiebreakers (in order):
1. Most completed commission cards
2. Most points from usable palette cards
3. Most points from artist bonuses

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can I complete a commission during another player’s turn?**  
  No. Only on your own turn, during your Painting Phase.

- **Can I trade commission cards with other players?**  
  No. Only palette cards may be traded. Commission trades are only with the Gallery.

- **Can I mix colors from non-adjacent hexes?**  
  No. Only dabs on **immediately adjacent** hex sides are mixed.

- **What happens if the palette bank runs out of a card?**  
  The rules do not specify. Assume supply is sufficient; if depletion occurs, no more of that card can be taken.

- **Can I use bank trades to get primary colors directly?**  
  No. Only via the **Primary Swap** (give one primary + any card for a different primary).

- **Do I draw a commission card if I complete a Gallery commission?**  
  Yes. The Gallery is replenished from the deck, and you draw to keep 2 in hand.

- **Can I complete more than one commission per turn?**  
  Yes, as long as you have the palette cards.

- **Can I exceed 8 palette cards during my turn?**  
  Yes. The hand limit (8) is only enforced at the end of your turn.
