## VALLETA – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In 1566, Jean Parisot de Valette, Grand Master of the Order of Malta, founded the city of Valletta. Players act as builders contributing to the construction of the city. The goal is to earn the most Victory Points (VP) by constructing and upgrading buildings, using powerful character cards, and advancing along the scoring track. The game ends when specific conditions are met, followed by final scoring.

### 2. Components  
- 1 Street board (25 spaces)  
- 25 Barrel tokens (face-down, placed on street spaces)  
- 4 Player boards (1 per player)  
- 32 Houses (8 per player in 4 colors)  
- 4 Player figures (1 per player)  
- 1 Jean Parisot de Valette figure (purple)  
- 37 Building cards (in green, blue, yellow)  
- 73 Character cards (red, green, blue, yellow, purple)

### 3. Setup  
**Street & Barrels:**  
- Assemble the Street board.  
- Shuffle Barrel tokens face down and place one on each of the 25 spaces.  
- For 2 players: place Barrels only on every other space (odd-numbered).  
- For 3 players: skip every 3rd space.  
- For 4 players: all 25 spaces get a Barrel.  

**Building Cards:**  
- Select and shuffle Building cards by player count:  
  - 2p: 6 green / 8 blue / 6 yellow  
  - 3p: 8 green / 10 blue / 7 yellow  
  - 4p: 10 green / 12 blue / 8 yellow  
- Shuffle all selected cards together.  
- Deal into rows of 5 above and below the Street board alternately to form a display.  

**Player Setup:**  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 1 Player board  
  - 8 Houses  
  - 8 Character cards of matching color (with player icon)  
- Shuffle personal Character deck and place face down on Player board.  
- Draw 5 cards into hand.  
- Take 1 of each resource: Gold, Wood, Stone, Brick.  
- **Extra Resource Phase (2–4 players):**  
  - Last player takes 1 extra resource of each type.  
  - Starting from last player (counter-clockwise), each chooses 1 to keep and passes the rest.  
  - Unused resources return to supply.  

**Character Cards:**  
- Place 4 red **Builder** cards (no player icon) next to the board as general supply.  
- Place remaining Character cards on matching Building cards by letter (visible in top-right).  

**Jean Parisot de Valette:**  
- Place on the tower space at the left end of the Street board.  

**First Turn Adjustment:**  
- First player plays only 1 card on their first turn.  
- Second player plays 2 cards on their first turn.  
- All subsequent turns: 3 cards.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
**Player Turn Sequence:**  
1. Play 3 Character cards one at a time from hand.  
   - Resolve each card’s action immediately.  
   - Cards are discarded after use.  
2. After playing all cards, draw from deck to refill hand to 5 cards.  
   - If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new deck.  

**Card Types & Actions (Summary):**  
- **Red Cards (Basic Actions):**  
  - Shopkeeper, Lumberjack, Stone Sculptor, Brick Worker: Take 1 matching resource.  
  - Maid: Take 1 of any resource.  
  - Builder: Build or upgrade a building (see below).  
  - Apprentice: Copy the action of the previously played red or green card.  
  - Jean Parisot de Valette:  
    - Move Valette forward 1 space.  
    - Reveal Barrel: gain shown resource.  
    - Then: either discard 1 card to supply OR take 1 card from supply into hand.  
    - If Valette is on last space, no move or Barrel, but still discard/take.  

- **Building a New Building (via Builder or similar):**  
  1. Choose unoccupied Building card.  
  2. Pay full cost (Gold, Wood, Stone, Brick).  
     - Adjacency Bonus: Pay 1 less Gold per orthogonally adjacent owned building (min 0).  
  3. Take Character card from Building into hand.  
  4. Place House on Building card.  

- **Upgrading a Building:**  
  1. Choose owned, un-upgraded building.  
  2. Pay upgrade cost (Wood, Stone, Brick only; no Gold).  
  3. Flip Building card to upgraded side.  
  4. Return House.  

- **Substitution Rule:**  
  - When building or upgrading, substitute 3 of any resource for 1 of any type.  
  - Only allowed for construction costs, not for general exchange.  

- **Construction Bonus:**  
  - +2 VP (immediate) if building or upgrading in the same 5-space zone where Valette is located.

    - Nun: take 3 of one resource; each opponent takes 1.  
    - Architect, Grand Master, Emperor, etc.: pay resources to move forward on scoring track.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Hand Management:** Always play 3 cards per turn (except first round and final phase).  
- **Deck Cycling:** When deck is empty, shuffle discard to form new deck.  
- **Scoring Track:**  
  - Player figures move along 25-space track.  
  - Upon reaching space 25, take a 25/50-point token (25 side up), reset to space 1.  
  - On second pass: flip to 50.  
  - Third/fourth pass: take 75/100 token.  
- **Character Acquisition:**  
  - Gain new cards by building or hiring via Valette card.  
  - Dismiss cards to supply via Valette action.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**Final Phase Trigger (any one):**  
- A player moves Valette to the last Barrel (space 25).  
- A player moves their figure to space 25.  
- A player places their 8th House.  

**Final Phase Setup:**  
- After triggering player finishes turn and draws to 5, all players:  
  - Shuffle their draw deck and discard pile into one final deck.  
  - Keep current hand (5 cards) separate.  

**Final Phase Gameplay:**  
- Continue turns as normal: play up to 3 cards, draw to 5.  
- When deck is exhausted, do **not** reshuffle.  
- When a player runs out of cards, they take no more turns.  
- Game ends when all players have played all cards.  

**Final Scoring:**  
- **Building Points:** Sum VP values on owned Building cards.  
- **Resource Points:** 1 VP per 3 remaining resources (any combination).  
- **Total:** Building VP + Resource VP  

**Winning:**  
- Highest total VP wins.  
- Tiebreaker: most Houses built.  
- If still tied: shared victory.  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I substitute resources for Gold in adjacency discount?**  
  No. Substitution is only for paying construction costs, not for reducing Gold via adjacency.  

- **Can I substitute when upgrading?**  
  Yes, same as building.  

- **Does the Apprentice work after a blue/yellow card?**  
  No. Only after red or green cards.  

- **Can I hire a dismissed starting card from another player?**  
  Yes. Any card in the general supply can be hired.  

- **What if I have fewer than 3 cards in final phase?**  
  Play all remaining cards. No refill if deck is empty.  

- **Can I build across the street?**  
  No. Only orthogonally adjacent (up/down/left/right) on same side. Diagonal does not count.  

- **Do I get +2 VP for upgrading in Valette’s zone?**  
  Yes. Applies to both building and upgrading.
