## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
Warriors of God is a strategic board game simulating feudal conflicts between England and France during the Middle Ages. The game features two scenarios: The Hundred Years War (1337–1453) and The Lion in Winter (1135–1258). Players command historical leaders and their troops to gain control of territories, eliminate or capture enemy leaders, and earn Victory Points (VPs).

**Objective**: Score 30 VPs or have more VPs than the opponent at the end of 12 turns. The game uses a zero-sum scoring system—only the net VPs between players matters each turn.

### 2. Components
- Game map of medieval Western Europe
- 189 counters (leaders, troops, markers)
- 10 six-sided dice
- Two player-aid cards
- Victory Points (VP) Track
- Turn Record Track
- Impulse Track
- Captured Leaders Boxes (The Tower of London and La Conciergerie)
- Routed Leaders Boxes

### 3. Setup
**General Setup (Applies to Both Scenarios)**:
1. Place the VP marker at 0.
2. Set the Turn marker at Turn 1.
3. Place the Impulse Remaining marker at 0.
4. In each of the five neutral areas (Ireland, Lorraine, Navarre, Netherlands, Savoy), place two mercenary troops.
5. Sort unused leaders by arrival turn.
6. Use scenario-specific setup for initial leaders and troops.

**Selecting Non-Aligned Leaders**:
- Each player rolls a die.
- Higher roller chooses one of the two non-aligned leaders; the other player gets the remaining.
- English wins ties.

**Hundred Years War Setup**:
- Specific starting leaders and troop placements as per rulebook setup table (not fully detailed here, but referenced in rules).
- Non-aligned leaders are selected after board setup.

**The Lion in Winter Setup**:
- Neither side begins with a King.
- Use white-numbered leader counters.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn follows this sequence:

1. **Determine Initiative and Impulses**  
   - Both players roll 1d6, applying modifiers:
     - +1 if English King is in England
     - +1 if French King is in Ile-de-France
     - -1 if a player has no King
   - Higher roll wins initiative.
   - Initiative Player (IP) gets: 2 + lower die roll impulses.
   - Non-Initiative Player (nIP) gets one fewer impulse.
   - Ties: Initiative does not change; English wins on Turn 1.

2. **Conduct Action Impulses**  
   - Players alternate impulses, starting with IP.
   - In each impulse, a player may:
     - Move leaders
     - Remove an enemy control marker
     - Pass
   - Movement limits:
     - Up to 3 leaders across a river border
     - Up to 2 leaders across a clear border
     - 1 leader across an obstructed border
     - Naval movement:
       - Up to 2 leaders to a friendly-controlled area via sea connection
       - 1 leader to any area via sea connection
       - English may move up to 2 leaders from a friendly-controlled area across a sea connection to any area (Sea Dogs rule)
   - **Flypaper Rule**: A leader may not move from an area if the number of enemy leaders (plus enemy control marker) is ≥ friendly leaders. Control markers count as leaders.
   - **Aggressor Marker**: Placed when a leader moves into an area with enemy leaders and no friendly leaders.

3. **Resolve Battles**  
   - Battles occur in every area with leaders from both sides.
   - IP chooses battle order.
   - For each battle:
     - **Step 1**: Choose Battle Commander (BC)
       - Highest-ranking leader (most stars) must be BC; owner chooses in case of tie.
       - King need not be BC.
       - nIP chooses first.
     - **Step 2**: Optional Siege
       - Controlling player may retreat into a castle (become besieged).
       - **Siege Number (SN)** = AV + 3 + (Besieged BC Bravery) – (Besieger BC Bravery) – (Besieger Gunner SPs, max 2)
       - Besieger rolls 1d6:
         - > SN: Besieger wins — all besieged troops removed, leaders captured.
         - ≤ SN: Besieger retreats; leaders move per movement limits, may not enter enemy-controlled or occupied areas; those that can’t flee are captured.
     - **Step 3**: Conduct Battle Rounds
       - At least one round must be fought.
       - **Battle Dice** = min(BC Battle Rating, non-Gunner SPs) + min(BC Battle Rating, Longbow SPs/Leaders)
       - **Bravery DRM**: Player with higher BC Bravery adds difference to all die rolls.
       - Both sides roll simultaneously; hits on 6+.
       - **Aggressor Miss Tracking**: If aggressor scores no hits, place Missed marker. Two consecutive misses allow non-aggressor to force retreat after a third miss.
       - **Loss Assignment**:
         - Leaders cannot be removed if they have troops.
         - BC removed last.
         - One knight/chevalier SP removes two hits.
         - If any mercenary takes a hit, all remaining mercenaries on that side flee.
       - **Leader Elimination**: For each leader removed, roll 1d6 + leader’s stars on Elimination Chart:
         - Killed: Score VPs later.
         - Captured: Sent to enemy’s Captured Leaders Box.
         - Routed: Sent to Routed Leaders Box.
       - **Retreat Option** (after each round):
         - Either player may retreat, starting with nIP.
         - All leaders retreat to same adjacent area (per movement limits).
         - No retreat to enemy-controlled or occupied areas.
         - Leaders that can’t retreat are captured.
         - **Pursuit Round**:
           - Attacker conducts one final battle round.
           - Retreating side rolls no dice.
           - Attacker gets +1 DRM.
           - Surviving retreating leaders are disgraced.
     - Continue rounds until one side retreats, is destroyed, or surrenders.

4. **Determine Control of Areas**  
   - Remove all Aggressor markers.
   - For each contested area with leaders:
     - If enemy leader present, area becomes uncontrolled.
     - If uncontrolled and has non-disgraced leader:
       - **Home Area**: Automatically controlled unless mercenaries present → roll 1d6 ≤ 6 – (mercenary SPs)
       - **Non-Home Area**: Roll 1d6 ≤ leader’s rank – (mercenary SPs)
     - Only one control roll per area per turn.
     - Remove Disgraced markers.

5. **Raise Troops and Place Mercenaries**  
   - Non-initiative player first, then initiative player.
   - **Raise Troops**:
     - Controlled areas raise SPs equal to AV.
     - Can raise infantry or special troops (subject to limits).
   - **Special Troop Rules**:
     - **Knights/Chevaliers**: Only in England, Ile-de-France, Burgundy. One per area per turn. Only 3-star leaders can command (except 2-star Burgundians for Burgundian chevaliers).
     - **Gunners**: Only in AV 3 areas. One per area. Only French or English (not non-aligned) leaders can command.
     - **Longbowmen**: Only in England and Wales. Two each available.
   - **Mercenaries**: Return eliminated mercenaries to their home neutral areas.

6. **Deploy Troops and Recruit Mercenaries**  
   - Non-initiative player first, then initiative.
   - **Deploy Troops**:
     - Move unassigned troops between controlled areas along friendly-controlled paths.
     - Cannot cross obstructed borders.
     - Only English can deploy over sea connections.
   - **Recruit Mercenaries**:
     - Move from neutral home area to controlled area via friendly path.
     - Must assign immediately to a leader.
     - Cannot recruit if no eligible leader is present.

7. **Dispose of Captured Leaders**  
   - **Exchange**: If both sides have captured leaders, exchange equal star value. Initiative player chooses if multiple options.
   - **Ransom**: Pay ransom equal to leader’s star value by removing control markers (each worth AV in ransom).
   - **Rot**: Keep in Captured Leaders Box; lose 1 VP per star during scoring.
   - Exchanged or ransomed leaders go to Routed Leaders Box.

8. **Determine Leader Death**  
   - Roll for each leader in play, routed, or captured.
   - Use leader’s arrival turn number and Death Check Chart.
   - Roll 1d6 + leader’s stars:
     - Result determines if leader lives, dies, or is disgraced.
   - Dead leaders removed; flip to reveal next leader if applicable.

9. **Place Leaders**  
   - Place new and returned leaders:
     - 6 leaders arrive per turn: 2 English, 2 French, 2 non-aligned.
   - **Order**:
     1. Non-aligned leaders chosen alternately (nIP first).
     2. Remaining leaders placed by each player (nIP first).
   - **Placement Rules**:
     - Can place in friendly-controlled, neutral, or home area (even if enemy-controlled or occupied).
     - If placed in enemy-occupied area, place Aggressor marker.
     - If placed in home area, gain infantry SPs equal to rank.
   - **Crown King**: If no King, place King marker on any friendly 3-star leader.

10. **Dispose of Leaderless Troops**  
   - nIP assigns unassigned troops to leaders (up to command limits).
   - IP does the same.
   - Unassigned troops are removed.
   - Special command rules apply (e.g., non-aligned leaders cannot command gunners/knights).

11. **Adjust the Score**  
   - Score VPs for:
     - Controlling contested areas: 1 VP per AV per turn.
     - Killing leaders: 1 VP per star.
     - Capturing leaders: 1 VP per star.
     - Killing King: +1 VP.
   - Net VPs: Subtract lower from higher; adjust VP Track accordingly.
   - If VP ≥ 30, game ends immediately.
   - After Turn 12, highest VP wins. Ties possible.

### 5. Core Mechanics
- **Control Markers**: Track area control; removed if enemy leader enters.
- **Flypaper Rule**: Prevents leaders from leaving if outnumbered or equal in presence.
- **Aggressor**: Determines retreat and siege dynamics.
- **Command Limits**: Leaders command 3 × their stars in SPs.
- **Special Troop Restrictions**:
  - Only 3-star leaders command knights (except 2-star Burgundians).
  - Only French/English (not non-aligned) leaders command gunners.
  - Non-aligned leaders cannot command knights or gunners.
- **Mercenary Recruitment**: Must be assigned immediately; subject to same movement rules.
- **Sea Movement**: Only English can deploy over sea; both can move leaders via sea connections.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Scoring Phases**:
  - Area Control: 1 VP per AV per controlled area.
  - Leader Elimination: 1 VP per star for killed or captured.
  - King Killed: +1 VP.
- **End Conditions**:
  - Immediate win at 30+ VPs.
  - After Turn 12, highest VP wins.
  - Ties are possible.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can a leader move multiple times per turn?**  
  Yes, as long as each move is in a separate impulse.
