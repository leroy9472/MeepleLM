# Panzergruppe Guderian – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective

**Lore:**  
Panzergruppe Guderian simulates the German summer 1941 offensive toward Smolensk during Operation Barbarossa. The game focuses on the rapid armored thrusts by German panzer groups aiming to encircle Soviet forces west of Moscow. It captures the asymmetry of early Eastern Front warfare: German mobility and air superiority versus Soviet numerical strength and defensive tenacity.

**Objective:**  
Players earn Victory Points (VPs) based on territorial control, unit eliminations, and strategic decisions. The German player aims to seize key cities and maintain supply lines to the west, while the Soviet player seeks to delay the advance, inflict losses, and recapture objectives. Victory is determined at the end of 12 game turns by comparing VP totals and consulting the Victory Levels chart.

### 5. Core Mechanics

#### **Movement**
- Units may move any number of hexes up to their Movement Allowance (MA).
- **ZOC Rule**: Units stop when entering enemy Zone of Control (ZOC); cannot leave voluntarily.
- **Rail Movement (Soviets only)**:
  - Up to 8 combat units + leaders per turn.
  - Max 30 hexes; must start and end on railroad.
  - Cannot enter enemy ZOC.
  - Armored/Mech units count as 3 units.
- **German Rail Cut**: German units moving through a railroad hex may place a **Rail Cut Marker**. Soviets repair by moving into the hex during normal movement.
- **Out of Supply**: Movement and combat factors halved (minimum 1).

#### **Combat**
- **Initiation**: Phasing player may attack adjacent enemy units.
- **Soviet Requirement**: Attacking units must be within **leader’s radius**.
- **Odds Calculation**:
  - Total attacker strength vs. defender strength.
  - Round **in favor of defender**.
  - Apply terrain modifiers (e.g., forest ×2, river ×2 if attacked solely across).
- **Combat Results Table (CRT)**:
  - Odds range: 10–1 to 1–3.
  - Results include Ae/De, A1/D1, A2/D2, Eng, and split (e.g., D1/A1).

#### **Combat Results**
- **Ae/De**: All attacker/defender units eliminated. Opponent may advance.
- **A1/D1, A2/D2**: Choose to lose *n* steps or retreat *n* hexes. Entire stack retreats.
- **Eng (Engaged)**: Both sides lose 1 step. No retreat or advance.
- **Split Results (e.g., D1/A1)**:
  - Defender resolves first (loss or retreat).
  - Attacker then chooses to retreat or lose 1 step.
  - If attacker takes step loss, **may advance**.

#### **Retreats**
- **Optional**: May take step loss instead.
- **Path Determined By**: Opposing player.
- **Priority**: Retreat to **vacant hex** if possible.
- **Friendly-occupied hexes**: Allowed, but stacking limits apply.
- **Retreated units**:
  - Do **not** add strength if the new hex is attacked.
  - Are **eliminated** if that hex suffers any combat result (loss or retreat).
  - Exception: "Engaged" result does not trigger elimination.

#### **Advance After Combat**
- **Victorious units** may advance into vacated hexes.
- **Path**: Must follow retreat path; may stop at any point.
- **Ignore ZOCs** during advance.
- **If all enemy units eliminated**: Advance up to **2 hexes** (first must be enemy’s hex, second any empty hex).
- **Must advance immediately**, before other combats.

#### **Overrun**
- **When**: During Movement Phase only.
- **Cost**: +3 MP; attack at **½ strength** (after modifiers).
- **Success**: Must advance into vacated hex (no MP cost).
- **Failure**: Movement stops.
- **Defender Outcome**: If loss or retreat occurs, defender is **Disrupted**.
- **Disrupted Units**:
  - Cannot attack or move.
  - No ZOC.
  - Defend normally.
  - Soviet leaders lose function if disrupted.

#### **Supply**
- **German**:
  - Within 20 hexes of a road leading to hex 0120, **OR**
  - Trace 20 MPs (by unit type) to west edge.
  - Roads cross rivers for supply tracing.
- **Soviet**:
  - Unit must trace Line of Communications (≤ leader’s rating) to a **Soviet Leader**.
  - Leader must trace Line of Supply to **east edge**.
- **Out of Supply Effect**:
  - Movement and combat factors halved (minimum 1).
  - Judged at instant of movement or combat.

#### **Air Interdiction**
- **German**:
  - 3 markers per turn.
  - On railroad: +4 MP cost for Soviet rail movement.
  - Elsewhere: +1 MP to enter.
  - No effect on Soviet supply.
- **Soviet**:
  - 3 uses in game (not Turn 12).
  - Same MP effects as German.
  - **Interrupts German supply** if placed in hex.
  - Cannot place in German-occupied hex.

#### **Leaders (Soviet Only)**
- **Movement**: MA 10; infantry movement in forest, motorized on road.
- **Rail Movement**: Allowed; does not count toward 8-unit limit.
- **Functions**:
  - Enable attacks (must be in radius).
  - Coordinate supply.
  - Add leadership value to attack (capped at unit’s current strength).
- **Disruption**: Loses function if disrupted.
- **Evacuation (Optional Rule)**:
  - Once per turn, evacuate surrounded leader.
  - Returns next turn via hex X.
  - Max 2 evacuations per game.

#### **Stacking**
- **Soviet**:
  - Max 3 combat units per hex at end of movement or during combat.
  - May have 4 units if one is a leader.
- **German**:
  - Max 3 combat units per hex at end of any phase.
- **Retreats**: Overstacking during retreat causes excess units to be eliminated.

#### **Untried Units**
- All Soviet combat units start face-down.
- Revealed only when attacking or attacked.
- **0-0-6 units**: Removed when revealed.
- **0-1-6 units**: Can defend only; retreat if forced to attack.
- **Dead Pile**: Eliminated untried units go to pile; may be reused as reinforcements when counters run out.

### 6. Scoring & End Game

**Victory Points (VPs)**

**German VPs (Awarded at End of Game):**
- Occupation of cities/hexes (e.g., Smolensk = 20 VP, Yel'nya = 10 VP).
- **Occupation**: Must have combat unit present or be last to pass through, **and** trace supply line free of enemy units/ZOCs to west edge.
- **Bonus**: +1 VP per SW Front rifle division used (first 5), +2 VP per division (next 5).

**Soviet VPs:**
- **+5 VP** per **entire German division eliminated** (excluding Cavalry Division).
- **+2 VP** per city **recaptured** (must have been fully held and supply-traced by Germans on previous turn).

**Victory Levels (After Subtracting Soviet VP from German VP):**
- ≤ 0: Soviet Decisive Victory
- 1–25: Soviet Strategic Victory
- 26–49: Soviet Marginal Victory
- 50–79: German Marginal Victory
- 80–124: German Strategic Victory
- ≥125: German Decisive Victory

*Note: Optional rule allows German Marginal Victory to count as draw if players prefer historical outcome.*

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases

- **Can you retreat into a hex adjacent to the combat hex?**  
  Yes, as long as you move two hexes for a D2/A2 result, and final hex is vacant or friendly-occupied and not in enemy ZOC.

- **Can attackers retreat into the defender’s vacated hex?**  
  Yes, if it is vacant and not in enemy ZOC.

- **Do retreated units block ZOCs?**  
  Yes, but they do not contribute strength if the hex is attacked.

- **Can German units overstack during retreat?**  
  No. Overstacking during retreat results in elimination of excess units.

- **Does “Engaged” result eliminate retreated units?**  
  No. Only loss or retreat results eliminate them.

- **Can units be out of supply indefinitely?**  
  Yes. No elimination for lack of supply.

- **Can leaders be used to absorb step losses?**  
  Yes. Leaders count as one step.

- **Are split results subject to advance?**  
  Only if attacker chooses step loss (not retreat).
