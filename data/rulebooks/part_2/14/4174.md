## Lifeboat — Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Lifeboat is a survival and negotiation game set in the aftermath of a shipwreck. Players are passengers stranded on a lifeboat, each with personal goals: survive, save their loved one, eliminate their hated one, and collect valuable loot. The game ends when either the fourth bird is spotted (rescue) or all players die. Victory points are scored based on survival, relationships, loot, and special traits.

### 2. Components  
- Character cards (e.g., The Kid, Frenchy, Dr. Harter, etc.)  
- Love and hate cards (secret objectives)  
- Provision cards (items and resources)  
- Navigation deck (event cards)  
- Tokens:  
  - Wound (red)  
  - Thirst (yellow)  
  - Fight (orange)  
  - Row (brown)  
  - Overboard (blue)  
  - Unconscious/Dead (black)  
  - Bird (white)  
- Life Preserver (special item)  
- Player aid boards (bow, stern, middle, mini-expansions for 7–8 players)

### 3. Setup  
1. Deal one character card, one love card, one hate card, and one provision card to each player.  
2. Place provision cards to the left of the table.  
3. Arrange character placeholders in the boat in this order (from bow to stern):  
   - Bow: Lady Lauren, Sir Stephan  
   - Middle: Captain, First Mate, Frenchy, The Kid  
   - Stern: (end of line)  
   (Adjust for player count using mini-boards for 7–8 players.)  
4. Place Navigation deck to the right of The Kid.  
5. Shuffle Provision deck and place it near the boat.  
6. Place token supplies nearby.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each turn proceeds in three phases:

#### Phase 1: Quartermaster  
- The conscious, living player closest to the Provisions deck draws a number of Provision cards equal to the number of conscious, living players.  
- That player selects one card and passes the rest to the next conscious player toward the Navigation deck.  
- This continues until all conscious players have one card.  
- Unconscious players are skipped.  
- The Provision deck is never reshuffled.

#### Phase 2: Actions (in seat order from bow to stern)  
Each player takes one action:  
- **Do Nothing**  
- **Row**: Draw two Navigation cards. For each, choose to:  
  - Add it to the Row stack, or  
  - Place it face-down on the bottom of the Navigation deck.  
  - Place a brown Row token by your character.  
- **Change Seats**: Swap positions with another player.  
  - If they resist, a fight occurs.  
  - If successful and the other player hasn’t acted, they act immediately.  
- **Mug Someone**: Take either:  
  - A face-up Provision card, or  
  - One random card from their hand.  
  - If resisted, a fight occurs.  
  - The Kid may mug hidden cards without a fight.  
- **Take a Special Action**: Use an ability from a Provision card (e.g., open parasol, use medical kit).

**Fighting Rules**:  
- Declare fight by pushing attacker’s card up, defender’s down.  
- Others may join by aligning with a side.  
- Total Size values (character + bonuses from weapons).  
- Defender wins ties.  
- Losers (attacking side if tied) each suffer one wound.  
- If attacker wins, they achieve their goal (seat swap or mugging).  
- All participants place an orange Fight token (may trigger thirst).  
- Fight choices (what is taken) are declared **after** resolution.  
- Mugging someone whose only card is a used Flare Gun results in no card gained.

**Unconsciousness**:  
- A player becomes unconscious when wounds = Size.  
- Cannot act, draw, play cards, or resist.  
- Can be mugged or moved freely.  
- Others may play cards on them (e.g., water, medical kit).  
- If unconscious and goes overboard, they die unless they have a face-up Life Preserver.

**Death**:  
- Death occurs when wounds > Size.  
- Dead players are removed from the game if thrown overboard.  
- Otherwise, remain in boat as dead but score points if rescued.

#### Phase 3: Navigation  
- The conscious player closest to the Navigation deck resolves this phase.  
- If Row stack has cards:  
  - They look at all cards in the Row stack.  
  - Choose one to resolve; rest go face-down to the bottom of the Navigation deck.  
- If Row stack is empty:  
  - Resolve the top card of the Navigation deck.  
- After resolution, the played card goes to the bottom of the deck.

**Navigation Resolution Order**:  
1. **Birds**:  
   - Add a bird token for each bird icon.  
   - Crossed-out bird removes one bird token.  
   - At 4 bird tokens: rescue occurs, game ends immediately.  
2. **Overboard**:  
   - Named character falls overboard.  
   - Suffers one wound (unless Frenchy, has Life Preserver, or one is thrown).  
   - If Bucket of Chum is played or face-up in front of overboard player, all overboard characters suffer an additional wound.  
   - Takes wound from chum **after** initial overboard wound.  
   - Loses all face-up cards (except Life Preserver).  
   - Is returned to the boat unless dead or unconscious without Life Preserver.  
   - **Unconscious + overboard = death**, unless Life Preserver is face-up.  
3. **Thirst**:  
   - Triggered if:  
     - You rowed and card has oar icon.  
     - You fought and card has fight icon.  
     - Your name is under "Thirsty".  
   - Each trigger counts as one thirst (max 3 per turn).  
   - For each thirst, discard one water card or suffer one wound.  
   - Thirst is simultaneous.  
   - Unconscious players must be given water by others or die.

**End of Turn**:  
- Remove all Row, Fight, and Thirst tokens.  
- Row stack is cleared and recycled.  
- Begin new turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Turn Order**: Based on physical seat position from bow to stern.  
- **Switching Seats**: Turn order is fixed at start of turn; switching seats does not change action order.  
- **Life Preserver**:  
  - Permanent item.  
  - Prevents exhaustion wound from going overboard.  
  - Does **not** protect from card loss or chum.  
  - Must be face-up to work.  
  - Can be given to another player (before Navigation).  
  - Cannot be played on an unconscious player overboard.  
- **Weapons**:  
  - Multiple weapons allowed.  
  - Flare Gun:  
    - One-time use.  
    - Discarded after use (whether fired as signal or weapon).  
    - If used in fight, discarded regardless of fight outcome.  
- **Provision Cards**:  
  - Can be played face-up at any time.  
  - Face-up cards remain face-up forever.  
  - Cannot show hidden cards to one player; must reveal to all.  
  - Can be discarded face-down if voluntarily thrown overboard.  
  - Lost face-up cards (overboard) are discarded face-up.  
- **Cannibalism**:  
  - Body remains in boat.  
  - Loot remains on body until taken or lost overboard.  
- **Chum**:  
  - Effects are cumulative.  
  - Two buckets of chum = two wounds for overboard characters.  
- **Row Stack**:  
  - Recycled at end of turn.  
  - Unused cards go face-down to bottom of Navigation deck.  
  - Compass: Adds one card to Row stack before Navigation, even if empty.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
Game ends when:  
- Fourth bird is placed (rescue), or  
- All players are dead or overboard and unconscious.

**Scoring**:  
- **Survival**: Survival value of your character if alive.  
- **Loot**: Value of cash, jewels, paintings on your body at rescue.  
- **Love**: Survival value of your loved one if they survive.  
- **Hate**: Size value of your hated one if they die.  
- **Narcissist**: If you love yourself, score survival points twice (once for survival, once for love).  
- **Psychopath**: 3 points for each other death (excluding yourself and your secret love).  
- **No points** for death/survival of loved one unless you are a Narcissist.  
- If you love and hate the same person: score for **either** survival **or** death (whichever occurred).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Switching Seats & Turn Order**: Turn order is fixed at the start of the turn. If players switch, the original order still applies.  
- **Unconscious Players**:  
  - Do not act, cannot resist, can be mugged or moved.  
  - Must be given water by others or die from thirst.  
  - If overboard and unconscious, die unless Life Preserver is face-up.  
- **Life Preserver Overboard**:  
  - If only player alive, they are dragged alongside; treated as in boat for game purposes.  
- **All Players Unconscious/Dead**:  
  - Resolve Navigation cards until land is reached or all are overboard and dead.  
  - Unconscious overboard with Life Preserver dies if no one is conscious to pull them in.  
- **Simultaneous Chum**: Effects are summed (e.g., 2 chum = 2 wounds).  
- **Discarding Cards**: Voluntary discards can be face-down; lost overboard = face-up.  
- **Parasol**:  
  - Can be played face-up anytime.  
  - Must take "open" action to activate.  
  - Stays open if transferred.  
- **Weapons**: Multiple allowed. Flare Gun discarded after use.  
- **Mugging with Flare Gun**: If only card and used in fight, no card is gained.  
- **Defenders Win Ties**: In fights, if totals are equal, defenders win; attackers lose and suffer wounds.  
- **Mugging Choices**: Made **after** fight resolution.
