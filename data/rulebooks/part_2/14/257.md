## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. **Lore & Objective**  
   - Players are guests at Lucky Manor, each harboring a deep grudge against Dr. Lucky.  
   - The goal is to murder Dr. Lucky in secret—when no other player can see into the room—by making a successful murder attempt.  
   - Dr. Lucky moves through the mansion on a fixed path, and players must position themselves to strike when the conditions are right.  
   - Each failed murder attempt increases the attacker’s strength (via "spite tokens" or "Reasons"), making future attempts stronger.

2. **Components**  
   - Game board depicting Lucky Manor with numbered rooms (0–19)  
   - Player pawns and matching character cards  
   - Deck of cards: Movement, Weapon, and Failure (Luck) types  
   - Spite tokens (also called "Reasons")  
   - Doctor Lucky pawn (black)  
   - Optional: Pet tokens (cat Patience, dog Shamrock)  
   - Optional: Ghost-side Doctor Lucky card (for variant games)

3. **Setup**  
   - **Player Count & Room Closure**:  
     - 3 players: Close both wings (rooms 8–12 and 17–19 + Piazza)  
     - 4–5 players: Close one wing (either 8–12 or 17–19 + Piazza)  
     - 6–8 players: Use full board  
   - **Starting Positions**:  
     - All players begin in the Drawing Room (Room 0)  
     - Doctor Lucky starts in the Gallery (Room 15)  
   - **Cards**:  
     - Shuffle the deck.  
     - For 7–8 players: Deal 5 cards face down to each player  
     - For 3–6 players: Deal 6 cards face down to each player  
     - Place the rest as a draw pile; set aside a discard pile  
   - **First Player**:  
     - Shuffle cards and deal face up one at a time until a room card is revealed. The player who receives it goes first, and Dr. Lucky starts in that room.  
     - (Alternative setup: Randomly choose first player; Dr. Lucky starts in Gallery)  
   - **Optional Pets**:  
     - Dog (Shamrock): Prevents murder or card draw if it can see you  
     - Cat (Patience): Blocks all sight lines from the room it occupies (players in the room can see each other)

4. **Gameplay Flow**  
   Each turn proceeds in this order:  
   1. **Move**  
      - Take one free move between adjacent connected rooms (including through hallways and stairways, which are not rooms)  
      - Optionally play any number of Movement cards before or after the free move  
        - Each Movement card grants +1 or +2 movement points  
        - Some cards allow direct teleport to a named room  
   2. **Action**  
      - **Option A: Make a Murder Attempt** (if conditions are met)  
        - Must be alone in a room with Dr. Lucky  
        - No other player may have a line of sight into the room  
        - Player announces attempt and proceeds to resolve it  
      - **Option B: Draw a Card**  
        - Only if in a room where no one (including Dr. Lucky) can see you  
        - Draw one card from the draw pile  
        - If the draw pile is empty, trigger “Lights Out!”  
   3. **Doctor Lucky Moves**  
      - After the player’s turn, Dr. Lucky advances to the next room in numerical order (1 → 2 → ... → 19 → 0)  
      - Skips closed rooms  
   4. **Next Player Determination**  
      - Normally, play passes clockwise  
      - If Dr. Lucky enters a room with one player, that player takes the next turn  
      - If Dr. Lucky enters a room with multiple players, the one immediately clockwise from the previous player takes the turn  
      - **Exception**: On the first full round, all players must take one turn before Dr. Lucky can grant extra turns

5. **Core Mechanics**  
   - **Sight Lines**:  
     - Run perpendicularly through doors and hallways (no diagonals)  
     - Extend through multiple rooms and doors  
     - **Gallery** overlooks **Dining Hall** through the railing; sight is allowed, but movement is not  
     - Balustrade in Gallery also blocks line of sight between Lancaster Room and Lilac Room  
   - **Murder Attempt Resolution**:  
     1. Attacker declares attempt  
     2. Murder Value =  
        - Base value: 1 (default)  
        - + Weapon card value (printed on card; may be room-dependent)  
        - +1 per spite token (Reason) the attacker possesses  
     3. Other players, starting with the one to the left of the attacker, may play Failure cards or place spite tokens to add to the **Failure Value**  
        - Failure Value = sum of clover symbols on played Failure cards and any spite tokens contributed  
     4. If **Murder Value > Failure Value**: Attempt succeeds → attacker wins  
     5. If attempt fails:  
        - Attacker gains one spite token (Reason)  
        - All Failure cards used are removed from the game  
        - Other used cards (Weapon, Movement) go to discard  
        - One spite token from each contributing defender goes to the attacker  
   - **Spite Tokens (Reasons)**:  
     - Represent increasing frustration and strength  
     - Each failed murder grants one token  
     - Tokens are visible to all and increase future murder values  
     - Can be transferred to attacker when used to block a murder

6. **Scoring & End Game**  
   - **Win Condition**:  
     - A player wins immediately upon making a successful murder attempt (Murder Value > Failure Value)  
   - **Lights Out! Rule**:  
     - Triggered when a player draws the last card from the draw pile  
     - No more card draws (pile is empty)  
     - Sight lines are disabled: only players in the same room can see each other  
     - Makes murder attempts significantly easier  
   - **Game End**:  
     - Game ends immediately when a murder succeeds  
     - No further turns are taken

7. **FAQ or Edge Cases**  
   - **Can you move through closed rooms?**  
     - No. Closed rooms (8–12 and/or 17–19) are blocked. Players cannot enter or move through them. Dr. Lucky skips them in his path.  
   - **Can you stay in place during movement?**  
     - Yes. You may use zero movement and remain in your current room.  
   - **Can you draw a card and attempt murder in the same turn?**  
     - No. You may only take one action: either draw a card or attempt murder.  
   - **What happens if multiple players could take the next turn?**  
     - The player immediately clockwise from the previous player takes the turn, among those in the room.  
   - **Do you draw a card at the start of your turn?**  
     - No. Only if you end your turn in a room where no one can see you and you didn’t play a card or make a murder attempt.  
   - **Can pets block murder attempts?**  
     - Dog (Shamrock): Yes. If the dog can see you, you cannot attempt murder or draw a card  
     - Cat (Patience): Indirectly. It blocks all sight lines from the room, making it easier to hide  
   - **What happens to Weapon and Movement cards after use?**  
     - They go to the discard pile (unless they are Failure cards, which are removed from the game)  
   - **Can you play Failure cards even if you can’t see the murder room?**  
     - Yes. Any player may play Failure cards during a murder attempt, regardless of visibility (represents indirect interference)
