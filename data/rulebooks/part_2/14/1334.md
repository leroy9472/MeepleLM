## Entdecker – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
*Entdecker* is a tile-laying and area control game in which players take on the roles of explorers charting uncharted islands. The goal is to gain the most victory points by exploring islands, placing units (settlements, forts, scouts), scoring island groups, and collecting produce from jungle huts.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with edge start points  
- 6 stacks of blue (event) tiles – placed face-down (hidden stacks)  
- Numbered land tiles (1–6) – placed face-up in open stacks, except:  
  - Waterfall tile  
  - +5 tile  
  - +10 tile  
  (These three are set aside initially)  
- Scout, fort, and settlement markers (20/15/12 total units for 2/3/4 players, including scoring markers)  
- Money (starting with $7 per player)  
- Income die (used for variable income)  
- Produce tokens  
- Unit cost: Settlement $6, Fort $3, Scout $1  

### 3. Setup  
- Place 6 hidden stacks of blue (event) tiles.  
- Set up open stacks of numbered land tiles (1–6) face-up.  
- Set aside: Waterfall, +5, and +10 tiles.  
- Each player receives:  
  - $7  
  - 20 (2P), 15 (3P), or 12 (4P) scouts (including score marker)  
  - Choose color; priority order: red, white, yellow, purple  
- Place score markers at 0.  
- Follow any scenario-specific setup if used.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, follow these steps in order:

1. **Roll Income Die (if money < $4)**  
   - Roll the income die: gain X, each other player gains X+1.  
   - If result is "Wheel", active player chooses X (presumably from options, though exact values not specified).

2. **Select Start Space**  
   - Choose a starting point on the map edge **or** on an already-placed tile.  
   - If starting on a tile, it must be reachable from the map edge via connected white paths.  
   - The white line from the start must lead to an unexplored (empty) space.

3. **Pay Starting Expenses**  
   - Pay cost to enter:  
     - Map edge: no cost  
     - If starting from a tile: $2 per opponent’s settlement or fort located along the route from edge to start tile.

4. **Announce Number of Tiles to Explore**  
   - Choose how many tiles to attempt to place.  
   - Pay upfront:  
     - $4 per tile from **open stacks**  
     - $1 per tile from **hidden stacks**  
   - Payment is final; no refunds if fewer tiles are placed.

5. **Explore Tiles (One at a Time)**  
   - Draw and attempt to place tiles in order.  
   - For each tile:  
     - If it cannot be legally placed (must connect via white path to explored area), discard it.  
     - Otherwise, it **must** be placed.  
   - Player may choose to stop exploring early (explore fewer than paid for).

6. **Place Unit (Optional)**  
   - Place one unit on the **newly discovered land tile** where the ship ends:  
     - Settlement: $6  
     - Fort: $3  
     - Scout: $1  
   - Only one unit may be placed per turn.

7. **Cover Surrounded Single Spaces**  
   - If a space is completely surrounded and empty, fill it with a tile from the **open stacks**.  
   - If open stacks are depleted: search discard pile for needed tile; if not found, draw from hidden stacks (and reshuffle hidden stacks if necessary).

8. **Score Explored Islands**  
   - For each **island group** fully explored during this turn:  
     - Value = total number of tiles in the island + bonus if it contains the **Waterfall tile** (value not specified, but assumed positive).  
     - Determine majority control:  
       - Based on **unit type**, not number of units: Settlement > Fort > Scout.  
       - If tie in type, most units of that type wins.  
       - If still tied, active player wins.  
     - Scoring:  
       - 1st place: full value (round half up if needed)  
       - 2nd place: half value (round up)  
     - Return **settlements and forts** to owners’ supply.  
     - **Scouts remain** on the board and are used to explore jungle paths.

   - **Jungle Path Exploration (after scoring):**  
     - Active player sends their **first scout** along a jungle path.  
     - When a scout reaches a **hut**, draw a **produce token** and place it in the hut.  
     - Continue with other scouts in turn order (active player first).

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Tile Placement**: Must extend from edge or connected tile via white paths.  
- **Area Control**: Majority on islands determined by unit hierarchy (Settlement > Fort > Scout).  
- **Resource Management**: Money is tight; used for exploration and unit placement.  
- **Event Tiles (Blue Tiles)**: When drawn and placed:  
  - **Mine**: Gain $3  
  - **Pirate**: Lose half money (round down)  
  - **Friendly Natives**: Place 1 additional scout (no cost)  
  - **Storm**: End exploration immediately; no unit placement this turn  
  - *Note: Events only trigger if the tile is successfully placed.*

- **Scout Reuse**: When out of scouts, players may remove their scouts from the board to reuse them.

- **Stack Management**:  
  - Open stacks: preferred for replacements.  
  - If depleted: search discards, then hidden stacks (reshuffle hidden stacks if drawn from).

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- **End Condition**: Game ends when the map is **filled** (all spaces occupied).  
- **Final Scoring**:  
  - Score **huts**: For each hut, the player with the **most scouts** on the path leading to it scores the **produce points** on the token.  
  - **Tiebreaker**: Scout closest to the hut wins.  
- **Final Tiebreaker**: Most money.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I explore zero tiles?**  
  Yes, but you must still pay if you announced a number. You can choose to explore fewer than paid for.

- **What happens to scouts after island scoring?**  
  Scouts remain on the board and are used for jungle path movement.

- **Can I place a unit on a tile from a previous turn?**  
  No. Unit must be placed on a **newly discovered tile** during the current exploration.

- **What if I can’t place a tile from the open stack when covering a surrounded space?**  
  Search the discard pile. If not found, draw from hidden stacks (and reshuffle hidden stacks afterward).

- **Do events trigger if the tile is discarded?**  
  No. Events only trigger if the blue tile is **successfully placed**.

- **Can I use a scout placed via Friendly Natives to trigger jungle path movement?**  
  No. Jungle path movement only occurs during Step 8 (after scoring islands), and only scouts already on the board at that time are used.
