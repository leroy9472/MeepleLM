# The Capitals — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The Capitals is a city-building strategy game where 2–5 players compete to construct the most prestigious capital city over three eras (Victorian to Modern Day). The goal is to earn the most Prestige Points by the end of Era III to win the right to host the next World Expo. Players must balance growth across six city tracks—Population, Employment, Public Services, Progress, Economy, and Culture—while managing energy, initiative, and tourism.

2. Components  
- 1 Game Board  
- 35 Player Markers (7 per player color)  
- 5 Tourist Markers (1 per player color)  
- 75 Orange Energy Cubes (unlimited supply)  
- 1 Time Marker  
- 10 Construction Tokens  
- 110 Prestige Tokens  
- 143 Building Tiles:  
  - 27 Era I Buildings  
  - 27 Era II Buildings  
  - 24 Era III Buildings  
  - 25 Power Plants (sorted by level)  
  - 15 Starting Tiles: 5 Level 1 Power Plants, 5 Hotels, 5 City Halls  
  - 25 Prosperity Buildings  
- 5 Icons and Symbols Summary Sheets  
- 1 Highest Culture Token  

3. Setup  
- Separate tiles into stacks: Era I, II, III, Starting, Prosperity, and Power Plants (sorted by level, highest energy cubes first).  
- For 2–3 players: Return all building tiles marked with $\boxed{4}$ or $\boxed{5}$ to the box.  
- Shuffle Era I Building Tiles and place (2 + number of players) face-up in the $0 row of the Projects Area. $2 and $4 rows start empty.  
- Each player places one Player Marker on the starting space of each of the six tracks: Population, Employment, Public Services, Progress, Economy, Culture, and Workers.  
- Randomly assign Initiative Track order: place one Player Marker per space starting from the upper portion of the $3, 4x space and moving right. The last marker should land on the space matching the number of players (except in 2-player).  
- Each player pays the $ amount above their Initiative space, reducing their Economy Track accordingly.  
- Place the Time Marker on Round 1.  
- Each player receives:  
  - 1 Level 1 Power Plant, 1 Hotel, 1 City Hall  
  - 2 Construction Tokens  
  - 1 Tourist Marker  
  - 1 Icons and Symbols Summary Sheet  
- Set up city: place City Hall and Hotel side-by-side (horizontally or vertically), with Construction Tokens between them. Place Power Plant to the side and add 4 Energy Cubes to it.  

4. Gameplay Flow  
The game lasts 12 rounds, divided into 3 eras (4 rounds each). Each round has 5 phases:  
1. Political Phase  
2. Building Phase  
3. Tourism Phase  
4. Executive Phase  
5. Administrative Phase  
After rounds 4, 8, and 12: World Expo Evaluation (scoring).  
Optional Prosperity Phase occurs after Executive Phase in rounds 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Political Phase**: Players reselect Initiative order. Starting from the previous round's order, each player chooses an unoccupied space on the Initiative Track. Cost = (previous space’s multiplier) × (new space’s $ value). Players slide markers down first, then up to chosen space.  
  - 3-player exception: The 4-player space is usable after setup.  
  - 5-player exception: Rightmost space uses 1x multiplier in round 2 only.  
- **Building Phase**: In Initiative order, each player:  
  a) Selects 1 Building Tile from any Projects Area row ($0, $2, or $4).  
  b) Pays the row’s cost by decreasing Economy.  
  c) Immediately places the tile in their city.  
  - Placement Rules:  
    1. Must be adjacent to a Construction Token (4 sides).  
    2. Must be adjacent (including diagonally) to another tile of the same type—unless it’s the first of that type.  
  - Violating either rule incurs a -2 Prestige penalty per rule.  
  - Update all track positions based on tile effects.  
  - Immediate Effects (!) are resolved immediately.  
  - Construction Effects (wrench) trigger when built and when new adjacent tiles are added.  
  - Permanent Effects (∞) trigger when adjacent tiles are activated.  
  - No tile affects itself. Diagonal adjacency counts.  
  - Move any Construction Token that now has 4 adjacent buildings.  
- **Tourism Phase**:  
  a) Award Highest Culture Token to player farthest on Culture Track. Tiebreaker: Economy, then Initiative.  
  b) The player with the lowest Culture level loses their Tourist Marker to the Highest Culture player.  
  c) Attraction Levels:  
    - Level 1 (Culture ≥9): Take Tourists from players below space 6.  
    - Level 2 (Culture ≥14): Take Tourists from players below space 10.  
    - Level 3 (Culture ≥24): Take Tourists from all players below space 24.  
  - Only the Highest Culture player benefits.  
  - Tourist Markers remain on tiles until moved in Executive Phase.  
- **Executive Phase**:  
  a) Players activate tiles in Initiative order.  
  b) Number of activations = number on current Power Plant tile.  
  c) Highest Culture player gets +1 extra activation.  
  d) Activation cost = 1 more Energy Cube than currently on the tile (including printed cubes and Tourist Markers).  
  e) Tourist Markers may be used as 1 Energy Cube each. Must be moved to activate a different tile.  
  f) After each activation, check for triggered Permanent Effects.  
  g) Passing all activations grants 1 Prestige OR 1 Energy Cube.  
- **Administrative Phase**:  
  a) Move any filled Construction Tokens.  
  b) Advance Time Marker.  
  c) Move all tiles: $0 → $2, $2 → $4, $4 → removed.  
  d) Draw new tiles from current Era stack to fill $0 row. Total current-Era tiles in Projects Area = (number of players + 2). Include tiles in $2 and $4 rows in count.  
  e) If Time Marker passes a Prosperity symbol (rounds 3, 5, 7, 9, 11), proceed to Prosperity Phase.  
- **Prosperity Phase** (rounds 3, 5, 7, 9, 11):  
  a) Each player must either:  
    - Build a Prosperity Tile (if construction requirement is met), or  
    - Build a Lake (reveal any Prosperity Tile back-side).  
  b) Lake placement: adjacent to any existing tile, no placement penalties. Grants 2 Energy Cubes. Does not count as any building type.  
- **Progress Track & Power Plants**:  
  - Each ● on Progress Track allows upgrading Power Plant by one level.  
  - Only one Power Plant at a time. Replace old with new.  
  - Transfer all Energy Cubes from old to new plant.  
  - Higher-level Power Plants offer more Energy Cubes; best tiles go to first upgraders.  
- **Extra Taxation Action**: At any time, lose 1 Prestige to gain $3. Can be used multiple times per phase, but only to cover immediate expenses (e.g., tile purchase, initiative cost). Cannot be used for conditional effects. Must retain at least $1.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **World Expo Evaluation** (after rounds 4, 8, 12):  
  a) Employment Track: Gain/lose Prestige as shown on current space.  
  b) Unemployed Population: (Employment - Population). If negative, lose 1 Prestige per difference (max -3).  
  c) Public Services Adjustment:  
    - Apply track space effect (e.g., gain Progress).  
    - Lose 2 Prestige for each player ahead on Public Services Track. Tiebreaker: Economy, then Initiative.  
  d) Remove all Energy Cubes from Building Tiles (return to supply). Tourist Markers stay.  
- **Final Scoring** (after Era III World Expo):  
  a) Pay one last time for current Initiative space.  
  b) Resolve End of Game Effects (e.g., Community Center, Stadium, Theatre). Some trigger before World Expo (e.g., Gene Research Lab, Public Meeting Hall, Technology Park).  
  c) Score:  
    - 1 Prestige per 4 remaining Energy Cubes (return excess).  
    - 1 Prestige per 4 remaining $ on Economy Track (reduce accordingly).  
    - 1 Prestige per 2 Culture (round down).  
    - 1 Prestige per space beyond last Power Plant upgrade on Progress Track.  
- **Tiebreaker**:  
  1. Most remaining Energy Cubes  
  2. Highest on Economy Track  
  3. Leftmost on Initiative Track  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **End of Track Bonuses**: Trigger only once per tile built or activation, even if multiple spaces exceeded.  
- **Conditional Effects**: Apply once per qualifying resource. Example: “For every 3 Employment, gain 1 Culture” — if you have 12 Employment, gain 4 Culture.  
- **Tile Activation Same Round Built**: Allowed.  
- **Tourist Marker Use**: Must be moved to activate a different tile. Cannot activate the tile it’s already on.  
- **Power Plant Upgrade**: Only one level at a time. Cannot skip levels.  
- **Prosperity Tile Requirements**: Must literally have the most/least—ties do not count unless specified.  
- **Construction Token Movement**: Can be moved immediately when surrounded.
