## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Medici vs. Strozzi is a two-player economic strategy game set in Renaissance Italy, where players take on the roles of rival merchant families competing for dominance in trade and influence. The objective is to accumulate the most money by the end of three rounds through strategic auctions, efficient shipping, and control of trade routes and monopolies.

2. Components  
- Merchandise tiles: Each tile shows a number (0–5) and a color (Blue, Red, White, Green).  
  - Number breakdown per color: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 (six tiles)  
  - Two gold tiles (value 5)  
- Three harbor tiles:  
  - Harbor 1: Blue, Red, White  
  - Harbor 2: Green, Red, White  
  - Harbor 3: Green, Blue, White  
- Two player ship boards (Pink and Gray), each with three ships of increasing capacity  
- Money: Denominations of f50, f10, f5, f1  
- Monopoly track markers for each harbor and color  
- Starting capital: f300 (5×f50, 3×f10, 3×f5, 5×f1) per player  
- Central bag or pool for undrawn tiles  

3. Setup  
- Each player receives f300 in starting capital.  
- Place the three harbor tiles between the players.  
- Shuffle all merchandise tiles and place them in a bag.  
- Determine starting player: Pink (Medici) starts Round 1; Gray (Strozzi) starts Rounds 2 and 3.  
- Each player has three ships with increasing cargo capacity (implied by turn limits).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of 3 rounds. Each round proceeds as follows:  

1. Begin Round: The designated starting player becomes the first auctioneer.  
2. On Each Turn:  
   a. Auctioneer draws 1 to 3 merchandise tiles from the bag.  
      - May not draw more tiles than the number of open spaces on their largest available (undocked) ship.  
   b. Auctioneer sets a fixed price (can be f0) for the entire set of drawn tiles.  
   c. Opposing player decides whether to buy:  
      - If they accept, they pay the bank and take all tiles.  
      - If they refuse, the auctioneer must buy all tiles and pay the bank.  
   d. Purchaser must:  
      - Load all tiles onto a single ship, or  
      - Discard (dump) the entire set immediately.  
   e. If any tile is loaded onto a ship:  
      - That ship must immediately dock at an open harbor on the player’s side.  
      - Once docked, the ship cannot move, but additional tiles may be added to it later if space allows.  
   f. The player who purchased the tiles becomes the new auctioneer.  
3. End of Round: The round ends when either:  
   - All tiles have been drawn and auctioned, or  
   - One player has docked all three of their ships.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- Auction System:  
  - The auctioneer controls selection and pricing of 1–3 tiles per turn.  
  - All tiles drawn in a turn are offered as a single lot at a fixed price.  
  - Opponent may pass, forcing the auctioneer to buy.  
- Loading & Docking:  
  - All purchased tiles must be placed on one ship or discarded.  
  - A ship that receives at least one tile must immediately dock at an available harbor.  
  - Multiple ships can dock at the same harbor, but only one per player.  
  - Open spaces on docked ships may be filled in future turns.  
- Harbor Assignment:  
  - Ships are committed to a harbor upon first loading.  
  - No swapping or reassigning ships between harbors.  
- Cash Flow:  
  - All transactions go through the bank.  
  - Players may borrow from the bank during the game but must repay all debt before final scoring.  
  - The bank has infinite funds.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
Scoring occurs at the end of each round:  

1. Harbor Value Comparison:  
   - For each harbor, compare the total value (sum of numbers) of merchandise on each player’s ship.  
   - The player with the higher total receives f20 from the bank.  
   - In case of a tie, no one scores.  

2. Monopoly Track Advancement:  
   - For each harbor, adjust the monopoly marker for each color based on tiles present:  
     - Each non-zero tile advances the marker one step toward the owning player.  
     - Each “0” tile advances the marker two steps.  
   - After adjustment:  
     - If the marker is on the player’s side, they receive f10 from the bank.  
     - Bonus payouts:  
       - Third space: f10 bonus (total f20 if marker ends here)  
       - Fourth space: f20 bonus (total f30 if marker ends here)  
   - Markers do not reset between rounds; they carry over.  

Game End:  
- After Round 3, final scoring occurs.  
- Players repay any outstanding loans to the bank.  
- The player with the most money wins.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Can I draw more tiles than I can fit?  
  No. You may only draw up to the number of open spaces on your largest undocked ship.  
- What happens if I can’t afford to buy my own auction?  
  You must still pay the bank. Borrowing is allowed during the game.  
- Can I load tiles to a docked ship?  
  Yes, as long as there is space. Ships remain active for loading after docking.  
- Can two ships from the same player dock at the same harbor?  
  No. Only one ship per player per harbor.  
- Do “0” tiles count for value comparison?  
  Yes. They contribute 0 to the sum but still count for monopoly advancement (with double effect).  
- What happens if the bag runs out of tiles mid-round?  
  The round continues until either all tiles are auctioned or one player docks all ships.
