## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In mid-19th century Germany, over 200 railway companies rapidly expanded track networks, connecting small German states into a unified economic region. Players take on the role of shareholders in eight major railway companies, investing in shares and expanding track networks to maximize dividends and personal wealth.  

The game ends when all railroads are directly connected to at least two others, or such connections are impossible. The player with the most money wins.

2. Components  
- 24 company shares (3 per company)  
- 118 locomotives in 8 company colors  
- Money in denominations of 1, 5, 25, and 100 Talers  
- 25 player order tokens (5 per player color)  
- 5 player income markers (double-sided)  
- 8 company income cubes (one per company)  
- 1 draw bag for player order tokens  
- 1 game board with hex grid, cities, terrain types, and company start locations  

3. Setup  
- Place the board. Put one locomotive of each company in its starting city (colored hex). Place remaining locomotives in supply piles.  
- Place each company’s income cube on the income track at the value shown in its starting city (Main-Weser-Bahn starts at 2 due to ability).  
- Each player chooses a color, takes 5 order tokens and 1 income marker. Place income marker at 0.  
- Flip income marker to +50 side if player’s total exceeds 50.  
- Select a banker. Distribute starting money:  
  - 3 players: 40 Taler each  
  - 4 players: 30 Taler each  
  - 5 players: 24 Taler each  
- Auction one share of each company in this order:  
  1. Preußische Ostbahn  
  2. Niederschlesisch-Märkische Eisenbahn  
  3. Königlich-Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen  
  4. Königlich-Bayerische Staatseisenbahnen  
  5. Main-Weser-Bahn  
  6. Großherzoglich Badische Staatseisenbahnen  
  7. Cöln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft  
  8. Berlin-Hamburger Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft  
- Minimum bid: 1 Taler. Bidding proceeds clockwise. Highest bidder pays bank and takes share.  
- The winner of each auction starts the next auction.  
- After all 8 shares are auctioned, begin the first round.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in phases:  
1. Determine Player Order  
2. Execute Player Actions (in turn order)  
3. Check for Game End  

Phase 1: Determine Player Order  
- Each player calculates current income: sum of values of all shares they own (value = company’s current income).  
- Players place order tokens in draw bag:  
  - 1 token: highest income  
  - 2 tokens: second highest  
  - 3 tokens: third highest  
  - 4 tokens: fourth highest  
  - 5 tokens: lowest income  
- In case of ties, all tied players place same number of tokens.  
- Draw tokens randomly to determine turn order.  
- Players place their tokens on the player order track in drawn order.  
- Any leftover tokens return to players.  

Phase 2: Execute Player Actions  
Starting with first player, each active player chooses one action:  
- Pass  
- Offer a Share for Auction  
- Build Track  

After resolving action, player removes their token from the order track.  
When all tokens are removed, the round ends and a new round begins.  

Important: After a player builds track, immediately check for new direct connections and pay dividends.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Offer a Share for Auction**  
- Player selects one unowned share to auction.  
- Cannot offer 3rd share of a company until both 1st and 2nd shares have been auctioned.  
- Bidding starts at minimum 1 Taler.  
- Proceed clockwise; players bid or pass.  
- Highest bidder pays bank and takes share. Their personal income increases by the value of the share.  
- If all pass, share returns to unowned pool.  

**Build Track**  
- Player must own at least one share in the company they build for.  
- Choose one company and build up to 3 track segments (place locomotives), unless modified by company ability.  
- New track must connect directly to existing network of that company. Branching allowed.  
- Only one track per company in Berlin Approach zones.  
- Only one total track in rural hexes (plains, hills, mountains, Berlin Approach).  
- Urban hexes: cost increases by 1 Taler per additional company already present.  

**Track Costs**  
- Rural hex (plains, hills, mountains): 1 Taler  
- Urban hex: 2 Talers (base) + 1 per additional company already present  
- Berlin Approach: 2 Talers  
- Costs paid by company (from company’s money pool to bank), not player.  
- Company cannot spend more than it has.  

**Company Special Abilities**  
- (20) Preußische Ostbahn: May build up to 4 track segments per action  
- (17) Niederschlesisch-Märkische Eisenbahn: No extra cost in urban hexes (ignores +1 per company rule)  
- (11) Königlich-Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen: May build only up to 2 track segments per action  
- (16) Königlich-Bayerische Staatseisenbahnen: Each track costs 1 Taler less (minimum 1)  
- (14) Main-Weser-Bahn: Doubles income of the single highest-income city in its network  
- (15) Großherzoglich Badische Staatseisenbahnen: First track built per action on a non-urban hex is free  
- (12) Cöln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft: May spend at most 5 Talers per build action  
- (13) Berlin-Hamburger Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft: Pays no dividends until it directly connects Berlin and Hamburg with its own track  

**Income Increase**  
- When a company’s track reaches a city hex, increase company income by the number shown in the city (e.g., Hamburg = 3).  
- Immediately move company income cube on income track.  
- This increases value of all shares in that company.  

**Dividend Payment**  
- Triggered immediately after a player builds track that creates a new direct connection between two companies that were not previously connected.  
- All 8 companies pay dividends to their shareholders.  
- Each player receives from the bank: sum of values of all their shares.  
- **Priority Dividend**: The company that initiated the new connection pays double.  
- Indirect or prior connections do not trigger dividends.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Game ends immediately when:  
  - All 8 companies are directly connected to at least 2 other companies, OR  
  - Players agree it is impossible to achieve the above.  
- After final dividend payment (if triggered), players count only cash in hand.  
- Shares have no value at game end.  
- Player with most money wins. Ties are possible.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can a player build track for a company they don’t own shares in?  
  A: No. Must own at least one share.  
- Q: Does "directly connected" require adjacent hexes?  
  A: Yes. Two companies are directly connected if their track segments are in adjacent hexes and could allow through traffic.  
- Q: Does Berlin count as one city for all connections?  
  A: Yes. Berlin is a single urban zone.  
- Q: Can a company build more than one track in Berlin Approach hexes?  
  A: No. Only one track per company allowed in total across all Berlin Approach hexes.  
- Q: When Main-Weser-Bahn reaches a new city, which city’s income is doubled?  
  A: The highest-income city currently in its network. Only one city is doubled.  
- Q: Does Cöln-Mindener’s $5 limit apply to total cost or per track?  
  A: Total cost per build action.  
- Q: Can a player pass even if they have actions available?  
  A: Yes. "Pass" is a valid action.  
- Q: Are leftover locomotives a reliable way to judge game end?  
  A: Yes. Players can estimate if enough track remains to complete required connections.
