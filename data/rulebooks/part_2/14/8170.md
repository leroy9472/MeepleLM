### 1. Lore & Objective
Return of the Heroes is a fantasy role-playing board game where players take on the roles of heroes seeking to restore their family's honor by completing Heroic Deeds. The story evolves as players discover that a powerful evil force, the Nameless One, is behind the misfortunes of noble families. The ultimate objective is to defeat the Nameless One in a final battle. Players progress through exploration, combat, and quests to grow stronger before confronting this final threat.

### 3. Setup
**Introductory Game:**
1. Arrange region maps A–P in a 4×4 grid alphabetically.
2. Each player chooses a hero and corresponding character sheet.
3. Equip each hero with starting gold and hit points (e.g., Dwarf: 4 gold, 5 HP).
4. Place hero figures and manor houses on starting positions (e.g., Dwarf at D4).
5. Distribute specific Heroic Deeds:
   - Fighter: Free Daphne
   - Dwarf: Juan's Relic
   - Elf: The Axe of the Gnomes
   - Mage: Granatus' Panpipes
6. Place 32 PA tokens face-down on the board (2 per region, alternating edges).
7. Place 9 fixed-location counters at their coordinates (e.g., Crystal at A3).
8. Place 5 magic artifacts at their coordinates.
9. Place number chits and remaining counters beside the kingdom.
10. Use "The Shadow" as the Nameless One card (face-up).
11. Place Nameless One counter with the card; add to bag when first Heroic Deed step is completed.
12. Place Servants and Guards face-down beside the kingdom.
13. Place all other remaining counters (except market) into the cloth bag.

**Standard/Advanced Game:**
- Shuffle and randomly place region maps (excluding H, J, N initially in some variants).
- Players choose home regions.
- Nameless One card is drawn randomly and kept face-down.
- Heroic Deeds are either dealt randomly (Standard) or acquired during play (Advanced).
- Board setup otherwise follows similar principles with randomized exploration.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each turn consists of two phases:
1. **Movement Phase:**
   - Move up to your Movement Value (shown on character sheet).
   - Cost is 1 movement point per field.
   - Entering a field with a covered counter requires flipping it.
   - Movement ends when:
     - You enter a field with a red-border (monster) counter.
     - You choose to interact with a green (encounter) or blue (task) counter.
     - You take any action.

2. **Action Phase:**
   - After movement ends, perform one or more actions:
     - Combat (vs. monsters or Servants)
     - Trigger encounter (e.g., trainer, market, teleporter)
     - Accept or complete a task
     - Pick up an artifact
     - Complete a Heroic Deed step
     - Use an artifact (e.g., healing potion)
   - Actions end the movement phase.
   - Only one combat per turn unless specified otherwise.

After all players complete their turns, certain end-of-round procedures may apply (e.g., Threat Check in thematic variants).

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Combat:**
- Three types: Magic (blue), Ranged (green), Close Combat (red).
- To attack, choose a combat type available on the enemy counter.
- Roll 2 dice; total must be ≤ your Combat Value (modified by weapons/artifacts).
- Negative numbers in colored circles reduce your Combat Value for that fight.
- Multi-heart enemies require multiple successful trials in one turn.
- Failure = lose 1 Life Stone; Success = defeat enemy, gain reward, draw new counter.

**Trials:**
- Required for combat and movement across hidden fields (red, green, yellow).
- Roll 2 dice; must roll ≤ field number.
- Success = treat as normal field.
- Failure = place figure halfway; retry next turn.

**Hidden Locations:**
- Red, Green, Yellow fields require Movement Trial.
- Blue fields (lakes) cost 1 gold to cross unless using the boat.

**Experience & Skill Improvement:**
- Earn Experience Cubes (ECs) from tasks, events, and combat.
- Collecting ECs allows rolling extra dice during trials; choose best two.
- Combat Values can be increased permanently via:
  - **Trainers:** Pay 1 gold, fail a trial → +1 Combat Value.
  - **Artifacts:** Add bonuses (e.g., Elven Bow +2 Ranged).
- Maximum Combat Value is 11.

**Market:**
- Visit market counter to draw 3 (small) or 6 (large) random artifact counters.
- Buy artifacts yourself or sell to other players.
- Seller earns 1 gold commission per sale (paid by bank).
- Unsold items return to market pile.

**Death & Revival:**
- When natural hit points (above red line) reach zero, hero dies.
- New hero spawns at manor house with:
  - Starting gold and hit points
  - One inherited artifact (player’s choice)
- Lose:
  - All ECs
  - All gold
  - All tasks
  - All magic items (left on death field)
  - Market-bought items (returned to market)
- Heroic Deed card remains with family.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End Conditions:**
- **Victory:** Defeat the Nameless One.
- **Defeat:**
  - All heroes die and cannot continue.
  - In timed games: 45 turns elapse without defeating the Nameless One.
  - In cooperative variants: Servants occupy all four temple fires.

**Final Battle:**
1. Must possess a Precious Stone (reward for completing Heroic Deed).
2. Defeat one of the four Guards (requires Precious Stone).
3. After defeating a Guard, move immediately to [H3].
4. On next turn, fight the Nameless One:
   - Combat continues trial-by-trial until one side is defeated.
   - Each failed trial costs 1 hit point.
   - If the Nameless One has an asterisk (*) next to a combat type, you need a matching magic weapon to use that type.
   - With magic weapon, replace * with –3 modifier.
   - If you lose, you die; Nameless One regenerates fully.

- Fulfilled Heroic Deed: +5,000
- Defeated Nameless: +5,000
- Each magic artifact: +1,000
- Each Experience Point: +500
- Each gold piece: +100
- Each turn over 45: –500
- Each turn less than 45: +500

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I take multiple actions per turn?**  
  Yes, after movement ends, you can perform multiple actions (combat, task, encounter) unless a failed combat ends your turn (house rule dependent).

- **Can I fight other players?**  
  No, player vs. player combat is not allowed.

- **Can I drop items/tasks?**  
  Yes. Dropped market items return to market pile; other items/tasks remain on the field and can be picked up by others.

- **What happens to the bag after the Nameless One is drawn?**  
  No new counters are added to the bag. Defeated monsters are removed from the game, not returned.

- **Can I combine movement artifacts?**  
  No. Only one movement-enhancing artifact can be used at a time (e.g., boots, horse, cart).

- **Can I heal artificial hit points?**  
  No. Artificial hit points (from armor) cannot be healed. If lost, the armor is destroyed.

- **Do I draw a counter after an Event?**  
  No. Events do not trigger a draw.

- **Can I fail a trainer trial on purpose?**  
  Yes. You can choose dice results to fail intentionally and gain the skill increase.

- **Can I give items to other players?**  
  Yes, when on the same field (house rule encouraged for interaction).

- **What if I land on a dual-border counter without the matching task?**  
  You cannot see or interact with it. Ignore it completely.

- **Can I use the Magic Broom after failing the –2 Magic Trial?**  
  No. You must pass the –2 Magic Trial to pick up and use the Magic Broom.
