- Ship cards (29 total):  
  - 4 cards each of values 1–6  
  - 3 cards of value 7  
  - 2 cards of value 8  
- Promotion tiles (36 total), divided into 3 categories: Art, Science, Architecture (12 tiles each)  
  - Each category includes:  
    - 3 tiles of value 1 with gold symbol  
    - 3 tiles of value 1 with cloth symbol  
    - 3 tiles of value 1 with grain symbol

- Game board with commodity tracks for 4 cities (Venice, Rome, Naples, Florence)  
- Coins (kept secret from other players)

3. Setup  
- Each player chooses a color and takes:  
  - 3 flags (kept in personal area)  
  - 4 markers (1 for each city)  
- Place all player markers on the lowest space of each city’s commodity track.  
- Place coins in a supply near the board.  
- Shuffle all promotion tiles and place them face-down. Reveal 3 face-up next to the stack.  
- Determine starting player (any agreed method).  
- Shuffle ship cards. Remove cards based on player count:  
  - 3 players: remove 17 cards  
  - 4 players: remove 14 cards  
  - 5 players: remove 11 cards  
  - 6 players: remove 8 cards  
- Remaining deck is used for the round.

4. Gameplay Flow  
A round proceeds in turns. The round ends when all players have used all 3 flags or all ship cards have been drawn and resolved.

Each turn:  
1. Current player draws the top ship card.  
2. Players may bid on the ship in clockwise order, starting with the player who drew the card.  
3. Bidding options:  
   - Play a **Ware flag**: Gain +1 commodity at the matching port when placing the ship.  
   - Play a **+1 flag**: Ship’s value increases by 1 for speed ranking.  
   - Play a **Pirate flag**: Immediately claim the ship, returning any other flags to their owners.  
4. If no player plays a Pirate flag:  
   - The first player to play a flag (Ware or +1) claims the ship unless outbid by Pirate.  
   - If multiple non-Pirate flags are played, the first player to act claims the ship.  
5. If no player claims the ship:  
   - The drawing player removes it from play (face down) and draws the next card.  
6. After resolution, play passes to the left of the player who won the ship (or who drew it if no one claimed it).  
7. Players who have used all 3 flags are skipped.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Ship placement**:  
  - Ships are placed at one of three ports: Venice, Rome, or Naples (not Florence).  
  - Each player may place only one ship per port per round.  
  - Ships are stacked in descending order by value (highest on top).  
  - A ship played with a +1 flag is treated as one higher in value.  
  - If two ships have the same value, the one placed earlier is above (higher position).  

- **Commodity movement**:  
  - For each ware symbol on the ship matching the port, the player moves their marker up the port’s commodity track by 1 space.  
  - If the player used a Ware flag, they move their marker one additional space.  
  - Markers are placed farthest to the right in a space. If multiple markers occupy the same space, the one farthest left (placed first) wins ties.  
  - If a ship has scroll symbols, the player moves their Florence marker up by that number of spaces.  

- **Promotion tiles**:  
  - If the ship card has a promotion tile icon, the winning player selects one of the 3 face-up promotion tiles.  
  - After selection, reveal a new tile from the stack to maintain 3 face-up tiles.  
  - Value 1 promotion tiles have a resource symbol (gold, cloth, grain). If a player takes such a tile, they may move their marker up one space on the corresponding city’s commodity track (even if the ship wasn’t placed there).  

- **Tie-breaking in placement**:  
  - Ship speed: If two ships have the same value, the one placed earlier is considered faster.  
  - Commodity track: If two markers are on the same space, the one farthest left (placed first) ranks higher.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- **Round Scoring (after each of 3 rounds)**:  
  - **Ship Speed at each port (Venice, Rome, Naples)**:  
    - 1st (fastest ship): 15 coins  
    - 2nd: 10 coins  
    - 3rd: 5 coins  
    - Tie: Higher position in stack (earlier placement) wins.  
  - **Commodity Leader at each city (including Florence)**:  
    - 1st (highest on track): 15 coins  
    - 2nd: 10 coins  
    - 3rd: 5 coins  
    - Bonus: Players whose markers are in the top 3 spaces of a track receive additional unspecified bonuses (source confirms existence but not values).  
    - Tie: Marker farthest to the left (placed first) wins.  
    - Note: Starting space (bottom) does not score.  
  - After scoring:  
    - Players retrieve their 3 flags.  
    - All ship cards (used and discarded) are shuffled.  
    - Remove the appropriate number of cards for the next round.  
    - Commodity and Florence markers remain in place.  
    - The player with the highest marker in Florence starts the next round.

- **Final Scoring (after Round 3)**:  
  - For each promotion category (Art, Science, Architecture):  
    - Sum the values of all promotion tiles a player owns in that category.  
    - 1st (highest total): 30 coins  
    - 2nd: 20 coins  
    - 3rd: 10 coins  
    - Tie: Player with higher commodity marker in Florence wins the tie.  
  - Winner is the player with the most total coins.  
  - Final tiebreaker: Player with higher marker in Florence.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can a player use a Ware flag and a +1 flag on the same ship?  
  A: No. Each player may play only one flag per ship.  

- Q: Can a player place a ship at Florence?  
  A: No. Ships are placed only at Venice, Rome, or Naples. However, scroll symbols on ships allow movement on Florence’s track.  

- Q: What happens if all 3 face-up promotion tiles are taken?  
  A: As each tile is taken, a new one is revealed. The supply ensures 3 face-up tiles are always available if possible.  

- Q: Can a player advance on a commodity track via a promotion tile even if they didn’t place a ship there?  
  A: Yes. Taking a value-1 promotion tile with a resource symbol allows moving up one space on that city’s track, regardless of where the ship was placed.  

- Q: Do commodity markers reset between rounds?  
  A: No. Commodity and Florence markers remain in place across all 3 rounds.  

- Q: Who starts Round 2 and Round 3?  
  A: The player with the highest marker in Florence at the end of the previous round.
