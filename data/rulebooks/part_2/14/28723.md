## BEFORE THE WIND – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Before the Wind*, players take on the roles of merchants in a bustling maritime trade hub, acquiring goods via ships, storing them, and selling for profit. The goal is to accumulate the most victory points (VP) through strategic trading, storage, and shipment.

**Victory Conditions (End of Game):**  
- The game ends at the end of a round if **one or more players have reached the required VP total**.  
- In a **5-player game**, the threshold is either **50 VP** or **40 VP with at least four ships** in your personal fleet.  
- In games with fewer than 5 players, the game ends when a player reaches **60 VP**, and a second player reaches **50 VP**.  
- The player with the most VP wins. Tiebreakers:  
  1. Most goods in warehouse  
  2. Most money

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round proceeds in the following phases:

#### A. Start of Round  
1. **Start Player** draws a number of action cards equal to the number of players.  
2. Draw **1 card at a time**, from **at least 2 different decks**.  
   - Maximum of **2 cards from any single deck** (standard)  
   - In **5-player game**, max **3 from any one deck**  
3. Reveal the drawn cards face-up.

#### B. Select and Trade Action Cards  
1. Starting with the Start Player and proceeding clockwise:  
   - The active player selects **one face-up action card**.  
   - Other players who have not yet taken a card may **offer money** to the selector for that card.  
2. The selector may:  
   a. **Accept** an offer → receiving the money and giving the card to the bidder  
   b. **Reject** all offers → paying each offering player the amount they offered, and **keeping the card**  
3. Once a card is paid for (i.e., successfully bid on), it **cannot be re-bid**.  
4. Continue clockwise until all players have either:  
   - Acquired a card, or  
   - Been compensated (paid) and opted out  
5. Players may receive **Action Cards** or **Guilders (money)** as compensation.

#### C. Play Action Cards  
1. Starting with the Start Player, each player in clockwise order:  
   a. **Resolves** the action card they acquired this turn  
   b. **May play one Special Action Card** from hand, either before or after resolving the main card  
      - **Exception:** Cannot play a Special Action Card if a *Safe* card was used during the Trade phase  
   - **Restriction:** A *Purchase and Store* or *Exchange Stored Goods* card **cannot** be played immediately before resolving a *Shipment and Income* card  
2. Special Action Cards may be **held in hand** instead of being resolved when acquired.

#### D. End of Round Check  
1. **Pass Start Player Token** to the left.  
2. **Check: Fleet Leaves?**  
   - If **2 or fewer ships remain in the harbor**, the **fleet departs** at the end of the round.  
   - Trigger:  
     - Discard all remaining face-up ships  
     - Spoilage phase (see below)  
     - Replenish harbor with a full set of new ships  
3. **Spoilage Rules:**  
   - **In Hand:**  
     - All goods discarded, **except Builders** (not defined in source)  
     - **Silk spoils** (discarded)  
   - **In Warehouse:**  
     - Discard:  
       - All Apples  
       - ½ Spices (rounded down)  
       - All Cheese  
     - **Silk does NOT spoil in warehouse**  
   - **Preservation Cards:** Use after spoilage is determined. Save up to the number of goods indicated (first from warehouse, then from hand)

#### E. Replenish Ships  
- After fleet departure, deal a new full set of ships to the harbor.  
- In 5-player game: 3 large + 4 small

#### F. Check End of Game  
- After spoilage and replenishment:  
  - If **one player has ≥60 VP** and **another has ≥50 VP** → game ends  
  - In **5-player game:** Game ends if any player has **50 VP**, or **40 VP with at least four ships**  
- If not, start new round.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I play a Special Action Card without resolving a regular action card?**  
  No. You may only play one Special Action Card **if** you are resolving a regular action card this turn.  
- **Can I use Market Sales to sell goods after spoilage?**  
  Yes — as long as the goods were not spoiled (e.g., Silk in hand spoils, so cannot be sold)  
- **When does spoilage occur?**  
  After fleet leaves, **before** new ships are dealt  
- **Can I use Preservation on Silk in hand?**  
  Yes — Preservation can save Silk from spoilage in hand  
- **Can I use Exchange Stored Goods after spoilage?**  
  Yes — as long as the goods still exist  
- **Can I use Safe card to protect a card and also gain $5?**  
  No — two uses:  
  - Play **on your turn** during trade: blocks bids (protects card)  
  - Play **as a bid**: gain $5 from bank to acquire a card  
- **What happens if no one bids on a card?**  
  The selector keeps it automatically, without paying anyone
