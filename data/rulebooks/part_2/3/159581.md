## Maskmen: Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Maskmen is a climbing/shedding card game for 2–6 players where players assume the roles of wrestling managers, competing over four "seasons" to gain the most points by being the first or second to empty their hand each season. The core of the game revolves around dynamically determining the relative strength (ranking) of wrestlers through play. The player with the most points after four seasons wins.

### 2. Components  
- 60-card deck: 6 suits (wrestlers), 10 cards per suit (no ranks).  
- Wrestler mask tokens (or cardboard markers) to track relative strength.  
- Optional: tokens for scoring (+2, +1, -1).

### 3. Setup  
- **Hand Size**:  
  - 2–4 players: 15 cards each  
  - 5 players: 12 cards each  
  - 6 players: 10 cards each  
- Shuffle and deal cards face down.  
- Place wrestler mask tokens nearby for tracking strength.  
- Determine first Host: The player who last watched a pro wrestling match.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
A game consists of **4 Seasons**. Each Season is made up of multiple **Rounds**.

#### Round Structure:
1. **Host leads**: The Host starts the round by playing 1–3 cards of a single wrestler.  
   - If the wrestler has **not yet been played this season**, this is a **Debut** (must play 1 card only).  
   - If the wrestler **has been played**, this is an **Established** play (1–3 cards).  
2. **Turn Order**: Play proceeds clockwise. Each player must either:  
   - **Defeat** the previously played wrestler, or  
   - **Pass** (and is out for the rest of the round).  
3. **Defeating a Wrestler**:  
   - **If stronger (known)**: Play the **same number** of cards of a stronger wrestler.  
   - **If strength is unknown**: Play **one more card** than the previous play (max 3). This establishes the new wrestler as stronger.  
   - **Cannot play**:  
     - More than 3 cards.  
     - The same wrestler as the previous play.  
     - A weaker wrestler.  
     - A wrestler already played this round.  
4. **Update Strength Markers** (if needed):  
   - After a successful play that establishes new strength, update the hierarchy:  
     - Place the new wrestler's mask **above** the defeated wrestler.  
     - Copy over any masks above/below if the wrestler appears in other columns.  
     - Merge columns if all masks in one column are included in another; remove redundant columns.  
5. **End of Round**:  
   - When all but one player have passed, the last player to play cards wins the round.  
   - Discard all played cards.  
   - The winner of the round becomes the Host of the next round.  
   - **Exception**: If the winner’s hand is empty, the player to their left hosts the next round.

#### End of Season:  
- A season ends when **all but one player** has emptied their hand.  
- **Scoring**:  
  - 1st to empty hand: +2 points  
  - 2nd to empty hand: +1 point  
  - Last player with cards: -1 point  
  - All others: 0 points  
- **Reset**:  
  - Clear all Strength Markers.  
  - Deal new hands.  
  - The player who scored -1 hosts the first round of the next season.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Strength Hierarchy (Golden Rule):  
- A wrestler is **stronger** than:  
  - Any wrestler they have directly defeated.  
  - Any wrestler **below** those they defeated (transitive strength).  
- Relative strength is **permanent** once established.  
- Wrestlers in separate chains have **unknown** relative strength until linked.  

#### Strength Marker Rules:  
- When a wrestler defeats another:  
  - Place the winner’s mask **above** the defeated.  
  - If the winner appears elsewhere but not on top, **duplicate the chain above them** and place it above the new position.  
  - If the defeated appears elsewhere but not on bottom, **copy the chain below them** into the new column.  
  - Remove any column that is fully contained within another.  
- Players may use branching diagrams instead of columns for clarity.  

#### Play Limitations:  
- Max 3 cards per play.  
- Cannot reuse a wrestler in the same round.  
- Cannot play a weaker wrestler to defeat a stronger one.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Play **4 Seasons**.  
- Total points from all seasons determine winner.  
- **Tiebreakers** (in order):  
  1. Most +2 tokens.  
  2. Won the most recent round.  
- **Two-player variant**: First player to win **3 Seasons** wins the game (no need to play all 4).  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Q: Can I play a wrestler who has already been played this round?**  
  A: No. Only one instance of each wrestler per round.  

- **Q: What if I have no legal play?**  
  A: You must pass.  

- **Q: Can I play 1 card of a known stronger wrestler instead of matching 3?**  
  A: No. You must play **exactly** the same number of cards as the previous play.  

- **Q: Can strength ever be reversed?**  
  A: No. Once A > B is established, it remains for the season.  

- **Q: What if I run out of mask tokens?**  
  A: Use a branching diagram on paper or reuse tokens once columns are merged.  

- **Q: Can I start a round with a wrestler not yet ranked?**  
  A: Only if it’s a **debut** (1 card). Otherwise, only established wrestlers can be played.  

- **Q: What if the round winner has no cards?**  
  A: The player to their left hosts the next round.
