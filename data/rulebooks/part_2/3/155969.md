## Harbour Solo Rival Variant – Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
This is a solo variant for Harbour where the player competes against an AI-controlled Rival. The player aims to outscore the Rival by strategically buying buildings, manipulating the market, and managing goods. Victory Points (VPs) are earned through buildings and abilities. The Rival follows automated rules to simulate competitive behavior.

2. Components  
- Base Harbour game components  
- 4 White Dice  
- 1 Black Die  
- Rival player board (selected from two drawn)  
- Rival player pawn  
- Rival Bank (holds unused goods markers)  
- Central tableau of 5 building cards  
- Market board with goods tiles  

3. Setup  
- Set up as a 2-player game with 5 building cards in the central tableau.  
- Draw two player boards; the player keeps one, the other becomes the Rival’s.  
- Place the Rival’s pawn on the starting building of their board.  
- Randomly seed the market: place one good tile per market square.  
- Player sets up starting goods: choose 3 total goods from one of each color.  
- Place all unused goods markers next to the Rival’s board—this is the Rival’s Bank.  
- Player takes the first turn.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Turns alternate: Player → Rival → Player → Rival, etc.  
- The player takes a full turn following standard Harbour rules.  
- The Rival then takes an automated turn based on dice rolls and affordability.

5. Core Mechanics  
Player Turn:  
- Move worker to any vacant building (own, shared, or opponent’s).  
- Perform the full action. If using an opponent’s building, pay a toll (1 good of your choice).  
- May buy 1 building per turn (unless using Library or Clocktower).  
- Shipping: move goods down to ships, gain $ equal to ship value. Must sell all of a chosen good.  
- Building cost reduced by $1 per Coin icon owned.  
- Warehouses allow keeping 1 shipped good per icon (cannot store more than amount shipped).  

Rival Turn:  
- At the start of the Rival’s turn, check if they can afford the most expensive building in the market.  
  - If YES:  
    1. Purchase the most expensive building. In case of tie:  
       - Prefer the one with most VPs.  
       - If still tied, take the one furthest to the left.  
    2. Discard all goods from Rival’s board back to Rival’s Bank.  
       - For each Warehouse icon the Rival has, keep 1 good tile.  
    3. Adjust market:  
       - If building costs ≥$5: move $5 good down to a ship.  
       - If building costs ≥$9: move $4 good down to a ship.  
       - If building costs ≥$10: move $3 good down to a ship.  
    4. Restock the top row of the market.  
    5. Replace the purchased building with a new card from the deck.  
    6. Cost reduction: each Coin icon reduces building cost by $1.  
       - Optional: Anchor and Top Hat icons each reduce cost by $1 (for harder difficulty).  
  - If NO:  
    1. Roll all 5 dice (4 white, 1 black).  
    2. Black Die: Move Rival’s pawn one card to the left for each pip, cycling:  
       Market → Player’s buildings → Player’s starting building → Rival’s buildings → Rival’s starting building → back to Market.  
       - Skip any building currently occupied by the player’s pawn.  
    3. If the black die movement lands on a market building with 0 VP:  
       - Take 1 goods tile from Rival’s Bank and place it on Rival’s board.  
       - Remove the card and shuffle it back into the deck; draw a replacement.  
    4. White Dice: take the lowest value among the 4 white dice.  
       - Take that many goods tiles from Rival’s Bank and place them anywhere on the Rival’s board.  
       - Rival goods are always worth $1 when sold.  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- The game ends when any player acquires their 4th building (total of 5 including starting building).  
- If the **player triggers end game**, the Rival gets one final turn. During this turn, the Rival may buy any building they can afford that would give them the win, not necessarily the most expensive.  
- If the **Rival triggers end game**, the player does **not** get a final turn.  
- Final scoring:  
  - Total VPs from owned buildings and special abilities.  
  - Sell bonus goods (from Bonus Cards) for additional VPs.  
- **Tiebreaker**: The Rival wins in case of a tie.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- Q: Can the Rival use their own starting building?  
  A: Yes. The Rival may use their starting building action if their pawn lands on it during movement.  

- Q: Does the Rival benefit from Coin, Top Hat, Anchor, or Warehouse icons?  
  A: Yes. The Rival uses all icons on their board and buildings:  
    - Coins reduce building cost.  
    - Top Hat and Anchor can optionally reduce cost by $1 each (hard mode).  
    - Warehouses allow keeping goods when buying buildings.  

- Q: Can the Rival’s pawn occupy a building the player is using?  
  A: No. During Rival pawn movement, skip any building occupied by the player’s pawn.  

- Q: When the Rival gains goods from white dice, can they exceed 6 of a good?  
  A: No. The Rival cannot have more than 6 of any good. Excess gains are ignored.  

- Q: Can the Rival buy a building during their “cannot afford” turn?  
  A: No. Only during the “can afford” sequence. The white/black die phase is for gathering only.  

- Q: What happens if the Rival’s pawn lands on a building that gets bought?  
  A: The Rival’s pawn moves with the building to the new owner’s tableau and remains occupied. No toll is paid for the already-placed pawn.
