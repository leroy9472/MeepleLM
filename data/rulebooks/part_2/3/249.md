## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
**Lore:**  
The ship has struck a reef and is sinking. Players control sailors (and officers) scrambling to survive by boarding lifeboats, avoiding leaks, and reaching islands. Trust is scarce — every player acts in self-interest, voting strategically to sabotage or save boats. Rank, alliances, and betrayal shape the journey.

**Objective:**  
Get your pawns (seamen and officers) to islands to score points. The player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, the player whose boat reached an island first (or sits closest clockwise to that boat) wins.

### 2. Components  
- Game board with boat paths leading to islands  
- 6 colored lifeboats (Red, Yellow, Green, Purple, White, Black)  
- Colored pawns:  
  - Small pawns = Seamen (1 point each on island)  
  - Large pawns = Officers (2 points each on island)  
- 15 blue Leak Markers  
- Colored Hat Markers (3 per player, matching boat color)  
- 6 Vote Wheels (one per player)  
  - Made from:  
    - U-Shaped Cardboard Cradle  
    - Two double-sided adhesive strips  
    - Rectangular Front (with triangular window)  
    - Rectangular Back (no window)

### 3. Setup  
**Player Count & Pawns:**  
- 3–4 players: 5 seamen + 1 officer per player  
- 5–6 players: 4 seamen + 1 officer per player  

**Steps:**  
1. Each player chooses a lifeboat (not Black) and takes matching pawns and 3 Hat Markers.  
2. Assemble 6 Vote Wheels using provided instructions.  
3. Place blue Leak Markers beside the board.  
4. Choose Start Player; give them the Start Stick.  
5. **Boat Placement:**  
   - Start Player places their boat in any first-row bow outline (bottom of board).  
   - Others follow clockwise.  
   - Black Boat placed in any remaining first-row spot.  
6. **Pawn Seating:**  
   - Start Player places one of their pawns (officer or seaman) into any seat in any boat.  
   - Players continue clockwise until all pawns are placed.  
   - Pawns do **not** need to be in the player’s own boat.  

**Tiebreaker Note:**  
If tied in score:  
- First, whoever’s boat reached an island first wins.  
- If none reached, closest clockwise to the first-arriving boat’s owner wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round has **three phases**, led by the current Start Player:

#### Phase 1: Vote to Place a Leak  
- All players vote secretly using Vote Wheels to choose which boat gets a leak.  
- Reveal votes simultaneously.  
- Boat with most votes receives a leak.  
- **Tie?** Start Player chooses.  
- **If boat is full:**  
  - Conduct a **"You're-Out-of-the-Boat" Vote** among occupants only.  
  - Officers = 2 votes, Seamen = 1 vote.  
  - Vote to remove a pawn (by color).  
  - Most votes determines color; owner chooses which pawn of that color to remove (prefer removing seamen).  
  - **Tie?** Start Player breaks it (even if not in boat).  
- After removal, place leak in the vacated seat.

#### Phase 2: Vote to Move a Boat  
- All players vote secretly for which boat to move one row forward.  
- Boat with most votes moves.  
- **Tie?** Start Player chooses.  
- **If boat reaches island:**  
  - Remove all pawns from it.  
  - Score points:  
    - Islands award: 8/6, 6/4, 7/5 (high value for officers, low for seamen).  
  - Boat is placed next to board (in arrival order).  
- **Single boat remaining?**  
  - It moves forward every turn.  
  - If it sinks (more leaks than pawns), all are lost.

#### Phase 3: Swim to a Better Boat  
**Skipped if only one boat remains.**  
- **Deboard Phase:**  
  - Starting with Start Player, each player removes **one** of their pawns from any boat.  
  - Only one pawn may be removed **per boat**.  
  - If all your pawns are in boats already emptied by others, you skip.  
- **Reboard Phase:**  
  - Reverse order: start from last player who removed a pawn, back to Start Player.  
  - Each player places their removed pawn into a **different** boat.  
  - **No available seat?** Pawn drowns (removed from game).  
  - **Cannot re-enter the same boat** — must switch or drown.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Vote Wheels  
- Used in all votes.  
- Players rotate wheel to show:  
  - Boat color (for leak/move votes)  
  - Pawn color (for ejection vote)  
  - **Captain’s Hat** (special action)  

#### The Captain’s Hat (Override Rule)  
- During any vote, a player may select **Captain’s Hat** instead of a color.  
- **Only one player selects hat?**  
  - That player **Pulls Rank**: decides vote outcome alone.  
- **Two or more select hat?**  
  - Hats are ignored; vote proceeds without those players.  
  - **All players select hat?**  
    - All must vote again.  
- **Hat Marker Cost:**  
  - Every attempt (successful or not) costs 1 Hat Marker.  
  - Max 3 attempts per player.  
  - Markers are discarded immediately upon reveal.

#### Boat Sinking  
- After any phase, check: if **leaks > pawns** in a boat → **sinks**.  
- Remove boat, all pawns, and leaks from game.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger:**  
- All boats are either:  
  - On islands (pawns scored), or  
  - Sunk (all lost).  

**Scoring:**  
- When a boat lands:  
  - Each island has two values: [High/Low]  
    - High = Officer points  
    - Low = Seaman points  
  - Islands: 8/6, 6/4, 7/5 (assigned to specific island paths)  
- Total all points from landed pawns.  

**Winning:**  
- Highest score wins.  
- **Tie?**  
  - First, boat that reached island earliest wins.  
  - If none, closest clockwise to first-arriving boat’s owner wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I put a pawn in my own boat during reboarding?**  
  Yes, as long as it’s not the same boat you just left.  
- **What if I have no pawns to remove in Phase 3?**  
  Skip your turn in deboard phase.  
- **Can I vote for my own pawn to be thrown out?**  
  Yes — strategic self-sacrifice is allowed.  
- **What if a boat gets a leak and is full, but all occupants are mine?**  
  You vote alone. You decide who (if anyone) to remove.  
- **Can a boat move after reaching an island?**  
  No — it is removed from path and placed beside board.  
- **Do officers count as 2 for leak comparison?**  
  No — “leaks > pawns” compares **number**, not value. Officers count as 1 pawn.  
- **Can I use Captain’s Hat in the ejection vote?**  
  Yes — same rules apply.  
- **What if a boat has equal leaks and pawns?**  
  It does **not** sink. Only sinks if **leaks > pawns**.
