# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In Pax Pamir, 2–5 players assume the roles of Afghan tribal leaders navigating the shifting power dynamics of 19th-century Central Asia during "The Great Game." Players align with one of three empires—British, Russian, or Afghan—though loyalties may change. The game ends when an empire achieves Supremacy. The player with the most Influence in that empire wins. If playing with the Nation Building optional rule, the game ends after the 4th Topple or when an empire achieves Supremacy twice consecutively, and the winner is determined by Victory Points.

## 2. Components
- **120 Cards**: Includes 93 game cards (representing people and places), 4 Topples, 5 Loyalty cards, and 5 Player cards.
- **50 Cubes**: 10 per player in five colors (white, black, orange, yellow, purple). Cubes represent Tribes (on map locations) or Spies (on Tableau cards).
- **30 Cylinders**: 10 per empire in three colors (blue for Russian, green for Afghan, red for British). Cylinders represent Armies (on map locations) or Roads (on connections).
- **45 Discs**: 35 white (1 rupee each), 10 red (5 rupees each).
- **10 Red Discs**: Badal ("Revenge") tokens (optional).
- **6 Wazir Cards, 20 Headline Cards, 27 Capability Cards** (Khyber Knives expansion).
- **Regime Cards**: 4 cards indicating the current political climate.

## 3. Setup
- **Map Formation**: Arrange six Location cards (Transcaspian, Persia, Herat, Kabul, Kandahar, Punjab) to form the map.
- **Players**: Each player receives a random Player card, 4 rupees, and 10 cubes of their color.
- **Draw Deck & Market**: Create a deck of 40 random cards + 8 per player. Shuffle 4 Topple cards into four of six stacks. Stack these four (with Topples) at the bottom, then place the two non-Topples stacks on top. Deal 12 cards into two rows of six to form the Market.
- **Regime**: Place the "Political Fragmentation" Regime card near the map.
- **Loyalty**: Shuffle and deal one Loyalty card to each player. Each secretly chooses a starting Loyalty. Players seat themselves in ascending order by the seating number on their Loyalty card.
- **Favor Cards**: If an empire has only one loyal player, that player takes the corresponding Favor Card.
- **Optional Rules (Khyber Knives)**: Mix expansion cards into the deck. Use Nation Building rules. Form Empire Force Pools: Afghans start with 6 cylinders, Russians with 8, British with 10. Remaining cylinders are out of play until introduced via Headline cards.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
On your turn:
1. Take up to two actions (Standard or Special).
2. Take any additional actions allowed by the current Regime.
3. Perform Cleanup:
   - Automatically discard Patriot and Topple cards in the two leftmost Market columns.
   - Discard down to Tableau Size limit.
   - Refresh Market: Shift cards left and refill to 12 cards.

## 5. Core Mechanics
### Actions
- **Standard Actions**:
  - **Discard**: Discard one card from hand. If both Standard Actions are used to discard two cards, gain 1 rupee.
  - **Purchase**: Buy a card from the Market or another player’s hand. Cost depends on Market column (0–5 rupees). Pay by placing rupees on each card to the left in the same row. Hand Size = 1 + sum of ★ on Intelligence cards in Tableau. Cannot purchase a card if you placed a rupee on it this turn. Topple cards trigger immediately and do not enter hand.
  - **Play**: Play a card from hand to Tableau. Pay 1 rupee per opposing Tribe in the card’s location (negotiable). Tableau Size = 3 + sum of ★ on Political cards in Tableau. Place Units equal to card’s ★:
    - Military: Place Armies (Empire cylinders) at card’s location.
    - Intelligence: Place Spies (personal cubes) on card.
    - Economic: Place Roads (Empire cylinders) on adjacent connections.
    - Political: Place Tribes (personal cubes) at card’s location.
  - Resolve Impact Icons (Regime Change, Leveraged, Informants, Garrison).

- **Special Actions** (enabled by Tableau cards; each card can be used once per turn):
  - **Travel (Intelligence)**: Move Spies. Number of moves = card’s ★. Can place Spy on opponent’s Patriot/Loyalty Prize band to gain Influence.
  - **Counter-Espionage (Intelligence)**: Remove up to ★ enemy Spies from cards where you have a Spy.
  - **Bribe (Intelligence)**: Steal a card where you have a Spy. Cost: 2 rupees per ★ of target card. If target is opponent’s highest-ranked Political card, trigger a Coup (convert their Tribes to your color).
  - **Assassinate (Intelligence)**: Discard a card where you have a Spy. Cost: 2 rupees. Can take card as Loyalty Prize.
  - **Commerce (Economic)**: Take rupees equal to card’s ★ from any Market cards.
  - **Gifts (Economic)**: Buy a Gift (costs 2, 4, or 6 rupees) to gain 1 Influence in your current Empire. Or transfer rupees up to card’s ★ to another player.
  - **Tax (Political)**: Take rupees equal to card’s ★ from players with cards in the same location. Must have at least one Tribe and more units (Tribes + loyal Armies) than any other player in that location. Tax Shelter = sum of ★ on Economic cards.
  - **Campaign (Military)**: Move Armies and attack. Must eliminate defending Armies before Tribes/Roads. Lose one friendly Army per enemy Army eliminated. Can bypass Army-first rule with Intel (consenting Spy). Overthrow: If last Tribe in a location is eliminated, owner discards matching Political card.

- **Regime Actions**: During the current Regime, matching Special Actions do not count against the two-action limit.

### Optional Rules
- **Nation Building**: Remove Favor Cards. Game ends after 4th Topple or two consecutive Supremacies. Winner has most Victory Points:
  - 1 VP per Influence in the Supreme Empire.
  - +2 VP bonus if only one player is Loyal to that Empire.
  - **Honeymoon**: On first three successful Topples, remove all Units except Gifts. Players cull entire Tableau to hand (pay for Leveraged cards), then may freely discard.
- **Badal Tokens**: 10 red discs. Acquire one when your cubes or Tableau cards are eliminated by another player (max one per opponent per turn). Spend to increase ★ of a Special Action by 1 (max +3).
- **Khyber Knives Expansion**:
  - **Wazir Cards**: Awarded to the Ruler of each location (most Tribes + loyal Armies). Host on a Tableau card to use its actions (Consolidate, Regime Change), which take the host’s ★.
  - **Headline Cards**: Resolved when purchased. Can be sabotaged (discarded without effect). Round costs as indicated.
  - **Capability Cards**: Played when purchased. Can Augment a Tableau card (+1 ★, max 3) or provide a Capability (Persistent, Action, Interrupt, Topple) when activated.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
- **Game End Triggers**:
  - A Topple is purchased and an Empire achieves Supremacy.
  - The final Topple is discarded or fails.
  - (Nation Building) After 4th Topple or two consecutive Supremacies.
- **Supremacy**: An Empire has:
  - More Units in the current Regime’s Mode than all other Empires combined.
  - At least one Unit of each Mode (Army, Road, Spy, Tribe).
- **Victory**:
  - If Supremacy is achieved, player with most Influence in that Empire wins.
  - Influence sources:
    - **Loyal**: Loyalty card, Prizes, Gifts, Patriots of that Empire, Spies on opponent’s bands.
