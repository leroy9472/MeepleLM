## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Empire's End is a game of strategic decline. Players lead aging empires beset by famine, plague, and barbarian invasions. Though collapse is inevitable, glory can still be salvaged through wise leadership. The objective is to maximize victory points (VP) by the end of the game, balancing the loss of locations with the acquisition of powerful innovations. Victory comes not from avoiding disaster, but from leveraging it.

The game ends when the progress track reaches the "End" space. Players score VP from:
- Healthy locations (based on their point value)
- End-game scoring from innovations
- VP earned during Conflict phases and other abilities

The player with the most VP wins. In case of a tie, the player closest clockwise to the first player wins.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
The game progresses through a series of phases, advanced by moving the turn marker one space after each phase. Phases follow this order:

1. **Disaster** – Reveal disaster, bid or take
2. **Double Disaster** – (3–4 players only) Two disasters, resolved one at a time
3. **Economy** – Activate green abilities
4. **Industry** – Repair locations, build/sell cards, activate brown abilities
5. **Conflict** – Bid secretly, resolve outcomes
6. **Economy/Industry Combined** – Complete both phases in any order

After each phase, advance the turn marker. When it reaches "End", the game ends and scoring begins.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Disaster Phase  
1. Reveal top Disaster Card.
2. All players place a Disaster Marker on the location indicated by the number (counting left to right, including destroyed tiles).
3. Starting with the First Player, players clockwise choose to:
   - **Bid**: Pay 1 resource of a type shown on the card (Wheat, Hammer, Axe, or Coin as wild)
   - **Take**: Accept the disaster card and its consequences
4. Once a player takes the card:
   - They gain the First Player Marker
   - Take all bid resources (add to hidden stash)
   - Destroy the targeted location (flip to burned side). If already destroyed, destroy an adjacent location (or nearest if both adjacent are destroyed)
   - Gain the Innovation on the card and place it under a healthy location (following placement rules)

**Low Resources Rule**: After taking a disaster, if a player has fewer than 5 total resources, they may reveal their stash and spend 2 VP to gain 1 Coin. Repeat until they have at least 5 resources (can go negative in VP).

**Exhaustion & Refreshing**:
- Some Innovation abilities can be "Exhausted" (place cube on it) to use.
- Exhausted abilities cannot be used again until refreshed.
- One starting Road ability refreshes all exhausted abilities on adjacent locations during Economy phase.

#### Double Disaster Phase (3–4 players only)
- Reveal two Disaster Cards.
- All players mark both targeted locations (use both fire markers).
- Starting with First Player, each player must resolve both disasters during their turn, choosing order.
- May use resources gained from taking one disaster to bid on the second.
- First Player Marker goes to the player who takes the **second** disaster.

#### Economy Phase  
- All players simultaneously activate **green abilities** on healthy locations and innovations.
- Abilities may:
  - Gain resources
  - Convert resources
  - Refresh exhausted abilities
- Cannot use abilities on destroyed locations.
- Innovations under destroyed locations are inactive but remain in place.

**Starting Economy Abilities**:
- Farm (11 VP): Gain 1 Hammer
- Farm (8 VP): Gain 1 Axe
- Farm (3 VP): Gain 1 Wheat
- Road (x2): Refresh adjacent exhausted abilities
- Road (14 VP): Convert 1 Wheat → 1 Hammer or 1 Axe (up to 2 times)

#### Industry Phase  
Each player does the following in any order:

1. **Build or Sell Cards (up to 2 actions)**:
   - Build: Pay 1 Hammer (or Coin) per card. Cards with + cost 1 extra Hammer.
   - Towns reduce cost: Each healthy Town makes one card 1 Hammer cheaper (max 1 reduction per card).
   - Sell: Discard a card to gain 1 Coin.
   - After 2 actions, optionally discard all remaining cards and draw back to 4.

2. **Repair 1 Location**:
   - Pay Hammers and Coins as shown on the tile.
   - Only one repair per Industry phase.
   - Repaired location activates abilities **this phase**.

3. **Activate Industry Abilities**:
   - Only active on healthy locations.
   - Starting City ability: Reduce cost of one Innovation by 1 Hammer (has two copies).
   - City also allows swapping any two locations (innovations move with them).

**Innovation Placement Rules**:
- Place under a healthy location.
- Must go to a location with the fewest innovations already under it.
- Cannot place second innovation until all healthy locations have at least one.
- Innovations move with their location when swapped.
- One ability allows moving an innovation to another valid location.

#### Conflict Phase  
1. Reveal top Conflict Card.
2. Total Conflict Strength:
   - Base = number of healthy Armies (each gives 2) + any red abilities (each gives 1)
   - Add number of Axes and Coins secretly revealed
3. All players simultaneously reveal their bid (Axes and Coins).
4. Compare total Conflict Strength to thresholds on the card:
   - Gain/lose VP and resources as indicated
   - Player(s) with highest total gain bonus (listed in Victory box)
5. All players **not tied for highest** must perform the "Upheaval":
   - Swap their highest VP healthy location with the location at the position indicated (e.g., 11th tile)
   - If the highest VP location is already in that spot, no swap
   - Innovations move with locations
6. Discard all revealed Axes and Coins to supply.
7. Discard Conflict Card.

#### Economy/Industry Combined Phase  
- Each player chooses order: Economy then Industry, or Industry then Economy.
- Must fully complete one phase before starting the other.
- All normal rules apply.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
When the turn marker reaches "End":
1. Score VP from:
   - **Healthy Locations**: Add VP value of each healthy tile
   - **End-Game Innovations**: Apply all end-game scoring abilities on innovations under healthy locations
2. Final score = current VP track + location VP + end-game innovations

**End-Game Scoring Types**:
- Points for adjacent destroyed locations
- Points for adjacent healthy locations of a type
- Points based on number of destroyed locations (e.g., 2 VP per destroyed location)
- Points for having the most destroyed locations (13 VP)
- Points based on number of resource tokens (e.g., 1 VP per Coin)
- Copy another end-game ability
- Other specific effects

**Tiebreaker**: Player closest clockwise to the current First Player wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use Coin as any resource?**  
  Yes, Coin can substitute for Wheat, Hammer, or Axe in all cases **except** end-game scoring (where Coin only counts as Coin).

- **What happens if I have no healthy locations during Economy/Industry?**  
  You still perform the phase. You cannot activate abilities or repair, but you may still build/sell cards in Industry.

- **Can I repair a location and use its ability the same phase?**  
  Yes, repaired locations activate abilities **during that same Industry phase**.

- **Can I place an innovation under a destroyed location?**  
  No. Innovations must be placed under **healthy** locations.

- **Do innovations stay when a location is destroyed?**  
  Yes. Innovations remain under the tile and reactivate if the location is repaired.

- **Can I use a Free Bid ability more than once?**  
  No. Exhaust it to skip one bid. It must be refreshed before reuse.

- **Can I use Replace Current Disaster after bidding?**  
  Yes. You may use it at any point during the Disaster Phase, even after bidding. You must still bid or pass on your turn.

- **In Conflict, what if two players tie for highest strength?**  
  Both gain the Victory bonus. All others (not tied for highest) must perform Upheaval.

- **Can I swap a location with itself during Upheaval?**  
  No. If the highest VP location is already in the target position, no swap occurs.

- **Can I build two cards with only one healthy Town?**  
  Yes. One Town reduces one card’s cost by 1. The second card has no discount unless the second Town is healthy.
