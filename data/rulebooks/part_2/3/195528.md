## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
La Granja: No Siesta! is a strategic dice-placement and resource management game set on the island of Majorca. Players take on the role of farmers striving to build a successful estate. The objective is to earn the most victory points (VP) by efficiently using dice to collect resources, mark revenue boards, and advance along the Siesta track. The game ends when a player reaches the end of the Siesta track, and the player with the most VP wins.

### 2. Components  
- Colored player discs (4 per player in multiplayer; 8 player + 4 neutral discs in solo)  
- Dice (quantity varies by player count)  
- Revenue boards (player sheets for marking resources and income)  
- Siesta track board (shared progress track)  
- Esporles board (used in solo mode for neutral actions)  
- Roof tiles (24 total; 6 used for helpers, 18 used as timer in solo)  
- Helper tiles (grey and colored; quantity depends on player count)

  - Donkey/Commodity: 9 VP → neutral gains 9 VP, place on bottom cart  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
**Multiplayer:**  
1. Start player rolls all available dice.  
2. Beginning with start player and proceeding clockwise, each player:  
   - Selects one die from the roll  
   - Places one of their discs on the corresponding spot(s) on their revenue board  
3. Repeat step 2 with remaining dice until all are taken.  
4. Start player rolls the last remaining die; all players gain the resource shown.  
5. All players use collected resources to mark off spots on their scoring sheet.  
6. Pass the start player token clockwise.  
7. Repeat for subsequent rounds.  

**Solo Mode:**  
1. Draw one roof tile and set aside (timer decreases by 1).  
2. Roll 5 dice.  
   a. Player chooses one die:  
      - If it matches either of the two neutral dice (top box on Siesta board), neutral player advances on Siesta track.  
      - Place disc on corresponding circle on revenue board.  
   b. Choose one die for the neutral player → place in bottom box on Siesta board.  
   c. Reroll remaining 3 dice.  
   d. Player chooses one die from reroll:  
      - If match with neutral dice (top box), neutral advances.  
      - Place disc on revenue board.  
   e. Choose one die for neutral → add to bottom box.  
   f. Reroll last die and give to player:  
      - If match with neutral dice (top box), neutral advances.  
      - Place disc on revenue board.  
3. Update scoring sheet based on collected resources.  
4. After actions:  
   - If neutral player has no hats (discs) on their two dice (bottom box), they advance on Siesta track.  
     - If they land on a cart space, complete the highest available cart.  
       - Roll a die to determine which sport on Esporles board is taken.  
   - Move the two neutral dice from bottom box to top box on Siesta board.  
   - Combine the two previously top-box dice with remaining 3 for next round’s roll.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Dice Placement:** Players select dice to claim actions or resources tied to symbols.  
- **Resource Management:** Resources gained are used to mark progress on revenue board and scoring sheet.  
- **Siesta Track:** Shared track where players (and neutral in solo) advance; reaching the end triggers game end.  
- **Helper Selection:** When multiple players qualify for a helper, the player furthest ahead on Siesta track chooses first.  
- **Resource Carryover:** One commodity can be saved between rounds if a spare disc is available.  
- **Solo Timer:** 18 roof tiles act as a game-length timer; game ends when depleted if Siesta track not completed.  

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
**End Game Trigger:**  
- Multiplayer: When any player's hat (disc) reaches the end of the Siesta track.  
- Solo: When either the player or the neutral player reaches the end, or when the 18th roof tile is drawn.  

**Scoring (Multiplayer):**  
- Count all victory point spots earned on scoring sheet.  
- In case of tie: Player furthest along on Siesta track wins.  

**Scoring (Solo):**  
- Player’s final VP = base VP + (if player wins Siesta) number of steps ahead of neutral, or – (if loses) number of steps behind.  
- Scoring Tiers:  
  - ≤20: Practice, practice, practice…  
  - 21–30: Not enough to survive as a farmer on Majorca  
  - 31–40: People start to take you seriously  
  - 41–50: You have the potential to be a farmer  
  - 51–59: You can make a living as a farmer on Majorca  
  - 60+: Congratulations! The estate of 'La Granja' is now yours!  

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Tie in Multiplayer:** Winner is determined by Siesta track position.  
- **Helper Selection Order:** Determined by Siesta track position—furthest ahead chooses first.  
- **Spare Disc for Carryover:** Only one commodity may be saved between rounds, and only if a spare disc is available (i.e., not all discs are in use).  
- **Solo Neutral Advancement:**  
  - Neutral advances if no hats on its current dice (bottom box).  
  - After advancement, neutral’s dice are cycled: bottom → top, top + unused → next roll pool.  
- **End Game in Solo:** Game ends when either player reaches the end of Siesta track OR when the 18th roof tile is drawn.
