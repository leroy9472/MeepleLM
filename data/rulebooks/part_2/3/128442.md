# Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Eldar characters may form alliances with the Imperium when facing greater threats. In *Relic*, players can use Eldar characters with modified rules that reflect their unique abilities and technology. The objective remains the same as the base game: complete missions, gain levels, acquire relics, and be the first to fulfill the scenario’s victory condition.

### 2. Components  
- Eldar Character Cards (printable)  
- Eldar Wargear deck (fronts and backs with Eldar symbols)  
- Webway Portal wargear cards  
- Standard *Relic* game components (board, threat decks, power cards, etc.)  

### 3. Setup  
- Set up the base *Relic* game as normal.  
- Create a separate **Eldar Wargear deck** using the provided Eldar Wargear cards. Shuffle and place face down with a discard pile.  
- Eldar characters are placed on their starting spaces as per their character sheets.  
- Print and assemble Eldar Character Cards and Wargear cards as instructed (mounted on card stock).  
- If using Webway Portal wargear cards, they begin in the Eldar Wargear deck.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Movement Phase**: Eldar may use Webway/Forgotten Portals to teleport between portal spaces by spending 1 movement point.  
2. **Exploration Phase**: Draw threat cards as normal based on threat icons.  
3. **Engagement Phase**:  
   - Resolve threats.  
   - When drawing an **Eldar Enemy Threat Card**, choose:  
     a) Immediately discard and draw another.  
     b) Take it as an **Ally Asset**.  
   - Resolve text boxes if no threats.  
4. **Experience Phase**: Spend trophies, manage missions, discard excess cards.  

### 5. Core Mechanics  
#### Eldar Wargear Deck  
- Use **Eldar Wargear deck** when purchasing wargear (e.g., at Battlefleet Antias).  
- Eldar can use items from other decks (e.g., weapons from threat decks), but must draw from Eldar deck when purchasing.  
- If the Eldar Wargear deck is exhausted, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

#### Eldar Threat Cards  
- When drawing an **Eldar Enemy Threat Card**, choose:  
  - **Discard and redraw** one card.  
  - **Take as Ally Asset** (kept face up in front of you).  
- During combat, may **discard an Eldar Threat Card Ally Asset** to add **+2** to combat score.  
- Other players may **steal** an Eldar Threat Ally Asset; when they do, it becomes a **Trophy** instead.

#### Webway & Forgotten Portals  
- When an Eldar enters a space with a **Webway Portal** or **Forgotten Portal**, may spend **1 movement point** to teleport to **any other portal space** (Webway or Forgotten).  
- May continue moving if additional movement points remain.  
- **Webway Portal wargear cards** (items) can be:  
  - Placed on any space during Acquire Assets phase.  
  - **Picked up again** by the Eldar if on their current space during Acquire Assets.  
- **Cannot pick up** the board’s Webway or Forgotten Portals (they are not assets).

#### Apostate Assets  
- For **Eldar characters**:  
  - **Weapons, armor, equipment** = Apostate Assets **unless** from the **Eldar Wargear deck**.  
  - **Ally and Relic assets** = **not** Apostate unless they have yellow background (actual Apostate cards).  
- For **non-Eldar characters**:  
  - All **Eldar Wargear deck** items = Apostate Assets.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
- Standard *Relic* victory rules apply.  
- The first player to fulfill the scenario’s confrontation condition wins.  
- Eldar do not have unique victory conditions; they follow standard win conditions.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can Eldar use non-Eldar wargear?**  
  Yes, if acquired from threat decks or other sources, but must use Eldar deck when purchasing.  
- **What happens to an Eldar Threat Card when stolen?**  
  It becomes a **Trophy** for the stealing player.  
- **Can Webway Portal wargear be used by non-Eldar?**  
  Yes, but only if acquired (e.g., through theft or mission). However, only Eldar may **pick it up again** after placing it.  
- **Do Forgotten Portals count as Webway Portals for movement?**  
  Yes. Eldar may teleport between any combination of Webway and Forgotten Portals.  
- **Can Eldar discard multiple Eldar Threat Ally Assets in one combat?**  
  No. Only one may be discarded per combat (each card is used individually).
