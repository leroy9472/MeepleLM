## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Royal Palace*, players take on the roles of noble factions vying for influence in the royal court. The goal is to gain the most victory points by enlisting noble tiles from the palace garden, strategically positioning servants in castle rooms, and leveraging privilege cards. Victory points come from noble tiles, privilege cards, and end-game bonuses tied to control of garden areas.

---

### 2. Components  
- 1 game board (palace garden)  
- 42 noble tiles (36 placed on board, 6 unused)  
- 9 castle room tiles (forming a 3×3 grid beneath the garden board)  
- 4 sets of 25 servants (18 in personal supply, 7 in central supply per color)  
- Gold coins (general supply)  
- Privilege cards (draw pile and discard pile)  

---

### 3. Setup  
1. Place the palace garden board in the center.  
2. Shuffle the 42 noble tiles and randomly place 36 on the garden squares.  
3. Shuffle the 9 castle room tiles and place them face-down in a 3×3 grid under the garden board.  
4. Shuffle privilege cards and place them face-down as a draw pile; create a discard pile nearby.  
5. Place all gold in a central supply.  
6. Each player takes 18 servants of their color into their personal supply.  
7. Place the remaining 7 servants per color into a central supply.  
8. Each player places:  
   - 3 servants on the **stairway**  
   - 2 servants on the **parade ground**  
9. Starting with the youngest player (start player):  
   - The start player gives 1 gold to the second player, 2 to the third, 3 to the fourth. The start player receives no gold.  
10. In turn order, each player places 5 servants into any castle rooms (e.g., 2 in Pompadour’s room, 3 on the back door).  
    - After this phase, each player has 8 servants remaining in their personal supply.  

---

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take full turns in clockwise order, starting with the start player. Each turn follows a fixed sequence of actions (1 to 5). The game ends when 12 or fewer noble tiles remain in the garden at the start of the start player’s turn — that player completes their turn, then all others take one final turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Turn Actions (in order)  

**1. Parade Ground – Supply**  
- For each of your servants on the **parade ground**, place 1 servant from your **personal supply** onto the **castle gate**.  
- **Majority Bonus**: If you have an *absolute majority* (more than any other player) on the parade ground, place **1 extra** servant on the castle gate.  

> *Note: Servants on the castle gate are used to move into castle rooms later (via action 2).*

---

**2. Stairway – Move**  
- For each of your servants on the **stairway**, you may move one of your servants **one step** (orthogonally only) within the castle rooms.  
  - You may use all movements on a single servant.  
  - Movement may pass through multiple rooms in one turn.  
  - Unused movements are lost.  
- **Majority Bonus**: If you have an *absolute majority* on the stairway, perform **1 extra movement**.  

> *Note: Movement during this phase does not affect the number of movements this turn (only next turn’s stairway count).*

---

**3. Mint, Mme de Pompadour, King, Office – Action Phase (Order Chosen by Player)**  

**A. Mint – Gold**  
- Receive **1 gold per servant** you have in the **mint**.  
- **Majority Bonus**: If you have an *absolute majority* on the **parade ground**, receive **1 extra gold**.  

**B. Mme de Pompadour – Violet Seals**  
- The number of your servants here = number of **violet seals** you can use this turn.  
- **Majority Bonus**: If you have an *absolute majority* here, place **1 extra servant** (from personal supply or another room) into this room.  

**C. King’s Chamber – Turquoise Seals**  
- The number of your servants here = number of **turquoise seals** you can use this turn.  
- **Majority Bonus**: If you have an *absolute majority* here, place **1 extra servant** (from personal supply or another room) into this room.  

**D. Office – Enlist Nobles**  
- For each of your servants in the **office**, you may attempt to **enlist one noble** (if requirements are met).  
- No majority bonus.  

---

**4. Enlisting Nobles**  
To enlist a noble:  
1. Remove **1 servant** from the **office** (return to personal supply).  
2. Pay the **gold cost** shown on the noble tile.  
3. Return **X servants** from **Mme de Pompadour’s chamber** (X = number of violet seals required).  
4. Return **Y servants** from the **King’s chamber** (Y = number of turquoise seals required).  
> *Only if all conditions are met may you take the noble tile.*

- You may enlist **multiple nobles per turn** if you have enough servants in the office and can pay all costs.  
- Nobles with **no special benefit** are kept **face-down** in front of you.  
- Nobles with **in-game benefits** must be placed **face-up**.  

**Gold Cost Reduction:**  
- For each **adjacent unoccupied garden field** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) to the noble being enlisted, reduce gold cost by 1.  
  - Minimum cost: 0 (no negative cost).  
  - **Garden ornaments block adjacency** (do not count as open fields).  

**Edge Field Rule:**  
- If a noble is on the **edge** of the garden, after enlisting it, place **1 of your servants** (from personal supply or a castle room) onto that **empty field**.  
  - This servant remains there until the end of the game.  
  - It counts as "occupied" for movement but as **"free" for cost reduction** purposes.  

---

**5. Back Door – Privilege Cards**  
- For each of your servants on the **back door**, draw **1 privilege card**.  
- For each card you wish to **keep**, you must return **1 of your servants** from the back door to your personal supply.  
- Discarded cards go to a discard pile.  
- When the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.  
- **No majority bonus** on the back door.  

**Playing Privilege Cards:**  
- To **use** a card during your turn, pay its gold cost (to general supply).  
- Cards are played **at specific times** (see card descriptions).  

---

**6. Cardinal – Tie Breaker (Not an Action)**  
- Used to resolve ties in other rooms.  
- If two or more players tie in a room, the player with **more servants in the Cardinal’s room** wins the tie.  
- If tied in the Cardinal’s room, the tie stands (no majority).  

> *Example: Red and Yellow tie on stairway. Red has more in Cardinal’s room → Red gets majority bonus.*

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

**End Game Trigger:**  
- At the start of the **start player’s turn**, if **12 or fewer nobles** remain on the garden board, this is the **final round**.  
- All players take **one more turn** (including the start player).  
- Then proceed to **final scoring**.

**Final Score =**  
- Victory points from **noble tiles** (crown value)  
- Victory points from **played privilege cards** (face-up, paid)  
- **1 point per privilege card held in hand** (unplayed)  
- **Garden side control bonuses** (see below)  

**Garden Side Control (per side):**  
- Sides: Lion, Vase, Statue (Lying Man), Statue (Standing Woman)  
- For each side, count servants on edge fields.  
  - **1st place (majority)**: 6 points  
  - **2nd place (second most)**: 2 points  
- **Tie Rules:**  
  - Tie for **1st**: both get **2 points**, no 2nd place points.  
  - Tie for **2nd**: **no one** gets 2nd place points.  
- Corner fields count for **both adjacent sides**.  
- Players may place a servant on scoring spaces to mark points.

**Final Tiebreaker:**  
1. Most servants in the **Cardinal’s room** → wins.  
2. If still tied → **shared victory** (multiple winners).

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I use servants from the central supply during the game?**  
A: Only via a privilege card that explicitly allows taking servants from the general supply. Otherwise, **no** — all servants must come from your **personal supply** or be **moved from castle rooms**.

**Q: Can I move servants into/out of the stairway during action 2 and gain more moves that turn?**  
A: **No.** The number of movements is based on servants present **at the start** of action 2.

**Q: Can I enlist a noble that costs 0 gold?**  
A: Yes, as long as you meet all other requirements (servant in office, seals, etc.).

**Q: Do servants placed on edge fields after enlisting nobles count toward garden control?**  
A: **Yes.** They count fully for end-game scoring on garden sides.

**Q: Can I play multiple privilege cards in one turn?**  
A: Yes, as long as you can pay the gold cost for each.

**Q: Can I use a privilege card that gives extra seals to enlist a noble requiring 3 violet seals if I only have 1 in Pompadour’s chamber?**  
A: Yes. A "2 extra seals" card allows you to use **2 additional seals** beyond what your servants provide — even of a different color.
