### 4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Deal** 10 cards to each player.  
2. **Bidding Phase**:  
   - Players bid in turn, starting with the player to the left of the dealer.  
   - Each player must choose either:  
     - A number from **1 to 10**, indicating the number of tricks they intend to win.  
     - A **Nil** bid, declaring they will win **zero tricks**.  
3. **Trick-Taking Phase**:  
   - The player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick.  
   - **Spades cannot be led** until they are "broken" (see below).  
   - Players must **follow suit** if able.  
   - If unable to follow suit, any card may be played.  
   - **Breaking Spades**:  
     - Spades are "broken" when a Spade is played on a non-Spade lead (either because a player cannot follow suit or chooses to play a Spade when able to follow).  
     - Once broken, Spades can be led at any time.  
     - Exception: A player holding only Spades may lead a Spade even if Spades are not yet broken.  
   - The trick is won by:  
     - The highest card of the suit led, **if no Spade is played**.  
     - The highest **Spade**, if any Spade is played.  
   - The winner of the trick leads the next trick.  
4. Play continues until all 10 tricks are completed.

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Bidding**:  
  - All players must bid either a number (1–10) or Nil.  
  - Bids are binding; players are penalized for failing to meet them.  
- **Following Suit**:  
  - Players must follow the suit of the led card if they have at least one card in that suit.  
- **Spade Rules**:  
  - Cannot be led until broken (unless player has only Spades).  
  - Spades always beat cards of other suits when played in a trick.  
- **Trick Winning**:  
  - Card ranks (high to low): **A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2**  
  - Spade rank follows same order.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
After each hand:  
- **Successful Bid (X tricks or more)**: **+10 × bid amount**  
  - Example: Bid 4, take 4 or more → +40 points  
- **Failed Bid (fewer tricks than bid)**: **–10 × bid amount**  
  - Example: Bid 3, take 2 → –30 points  
- **Successful Nil Bid**: **+50 points**  
- **Failed Nil Bid**: **–50 points**  
- **Overtricks (bags)**:  
  - +1 point per trick taken beyond bid (including Nil)  
  - Overtricks are tracked cumulatively across rounds  
  - **Penalty**: When a player accumulates **6 or more overtricks**, they lose **10 points** and the overtrick count resets to **0**  
  - Maximum overtrick points per round: 5 (before penalty triggers)  

**End Game**:  
- The game ends immediately when a player reaches **125 or more points**.  
- That player is declared the winner.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I lead Spades on the first trick?**  
  No, unless Spades have already been broken or you hold only Spades.  
- **What happens if I take tricks while bidding Nil?**  
  You fail your Nil bid and lose 50 points. Each trick taken counts as an overtrick (+1 each), but the primary penalty is the failed Nil.  
- **Do overtricks from Nil count toward bag penalty?**  
  Yes. All extra tricks beyond your bid (including Nil) count as overtricks and contribute to the cumulative bag count.  
- **When does the bag penalty trigger?**  
  When your total overtricks (across all rounds) reach **6 or more**, you lose 10 points and reset your overtrick count to 0.  
- **Can I bid 0 without declaring Nil?**  
  No. The only way to declare zero tricks is via a **Nil** bid.  
- **Who deals first?**  
  The rules specify that **Player 4** is the first dealer in a fixed player order. Player 1 is to the left of the first dealer.
