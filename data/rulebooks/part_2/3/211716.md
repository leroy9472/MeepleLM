Players control influential families competing for wealth and prestige by managing Company offices, expanding trade, and influencing politics in India. The objective is to accumulate the most victory points by the end of the game through shares, manors, prizes, and revenue, while avoiding penalties from promises and game-end conditions.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
1. **Family Phase**: Each player (starting with Chairman, clockwise) takes one family action.
2. **Company Phase**:
   - Fill vacancies (Chairman first, then along blue ribbon).
   - Offices act in order along red ribbon (Ship Purchasing → Goods Purchasing → Military Affairs → Director of Trade → Presidencies → Provincial Offices).
3. **Trade Phase**:
   - Generate player revenue.
   - Pay Company expenses.
   - Allocate remaining revenue (dividends or office funding).
4. **Evening Post Phase**:
   - Reveal and resolve Evening Post card:
     - Events in India
     - Attrition
     - Local News (Law or Domestic Event)
   - Refresh board state.

### 5. Core Mechanics
**Family Actions:**
- Place cubes in one resource box per turn:
  - Writers, Officers, Captains: 1–2 cubes (up to 3 with Jones Family)
  - Shipyards, Factories: 1 cube per slot (must fill "6" before "5")
  - Shares: cost = current share price × number of cubes
  - Manors: 1 cube per turn
- Cube limits: if out of stock, use manor or prize cubes; if none, skip action.
- Jones Family Action (after players): roll 4 dice (2 players) or 2 dice (3 players); place cubes accordingly. Jones captains buy ships if available. Jones ships take "6" shipyard slots first.

**Vacancy Filling:**
- **Chairman**: Elected by Court of Directors.
  - Former Chairman nominates first.
  - Players vote clockwise starting with nominee.
  - Each cube in Court = 1 vote.
  - >50% support needed.
  - If no nominee succeeds, former Chairman chooses from failed nominees.
- **Executive Offices (E)**: Chairman promotes from Senior Offices (S); if none, from Writers.
- **Provincial Offices**: President promotes from Writers or Officers in army.
- **Purchasing Offices**: Director of Trade promotes from Writers.
- **Nepotism**: When promoting own cube over others, give 1 Promise per eligible player. Jones Family: 2 Promises.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
