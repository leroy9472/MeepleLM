### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Autobahn*, players take on the role of managing directors in the German BundesAutobahn organisation, overseeing the development of the federal highway network from post-WWII to the present day.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Building & Upgrading Roads  
- **Build Road Section**:  
  1. Place 1 tile on empty space (matching card color, adjacent to network)  
  2. Pay cost (varies by era and link length)  
  3. Place 1 Employee in matching Construction Office (leftmost seat)  
     - If full: bump left, leftmost Employee moves to Lobby  
     - If no Employees: return 3 from Lobby, place 1 in Office, **Promote 1**  
  4. Update city values if link completed  
- **Upgrade Link**:  
  1. Flip 1–2 tiles to dual-carriageway side  
  2. Pay cost per tile  
  3. Place 1 Employee in matching Office (same rules)  
  4. Update city values (cities gain +2 per upgraded link)  

#### Loading Trucks  
- Play card of matching color → place Truck in depot of that color  
- Load Goods (Appliances, Chemical, Automotive, Pharmaceuticals)  
- Can reassign existing Truck (return goods)  
- Second Truck unlocked via technology  

#### Building Service Stations  
- Available on 2-tile links  
- Must have at least 1 tile built  
- No cost

#### Promoting Employees  
- **Promotion Actions**:  
  - Use 1 or 2 arrows on card or bonus  
  - Requires unlocked Department access  
  - Move Employee:  
    - Lobby → 1st floor  
    - 1st → 2nd → 3rd floor (must have empty seat)  
  - Max 1 Employee per floor per player  
  - Max 3 Employees per floor total  
- If cannot promote: place Employee in Lobby instead  
- **Automatic Promotions**:

- **Era 1**: 10 sections built  
- **Era 2**: 12 more (total 22)  
- **Era 3**: 14 more (total 36) → all players get 1 extra turn  

**Administration Phase**:  
1. **Construction Budget**:  
   - For each Construction Office with Employees:  
     - Sum city values on that autobahn (connected cities only)  
     - Divide by # Employees in Office (rounded down) → each Employee earns that many DM  
2. **Promotion**: Trigger player promotes 1 Employee  
3. **Route Cards**:  
   - Check connection between cities  
   - **Status** = (# road sections) – (# upgraded links) – (# service stations)  
   - Best = 0 → gain all bonuses at that level and above  
   - Choose best alternate route if multiple exist  
4. **Reunification (End of Era 2)**:  
   - Remove 5 Roadblocks  
   - Add yellow Basic Cards to hands  
   - Replace Improved Cards in display with Advanced Cards
