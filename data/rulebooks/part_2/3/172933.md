## PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
You are an adventurer in the enchanted forest of Dragonwood, seeking to defeat magical creatures and capture powerful enhancements to earn Victory Points (VP). The goal is to score the most VP by defeating creatures, earning bonuses, and possibly defeating dragons. The game ends when either both dragons are defeated or two full passes through the Adventurer deck have occurred. The player with the highest VP total wins; ties are broken by who captured the Orange Dragon.

2. Components  
- 108 total cards:  
  - 64 Adventurer cards (red back): 5 suits (colors), numbered 1–12; includes 4 Lucky Ladybug cards  
  - 42 Dragonwood cards (green back):  
    - Creatures (green background): worth VP; require Strike, Stomp, or Scream to capture  
    - Enhancements (purple background): provide ongoing bonuses; no VP  
    - Events (orange background): trigger immediate effects for all players  
- 6 custom dice  
- 2 Turn summary cards  

3. Setup  
- Remove the 2 turn summary cards from the deck.  
- Separate the Dragonwood deck by card back (green). Identify and remove the 2 dragon cards (Orange and Blue).  
- Remove additional cards based on player count:  
  - 2 players: remove 12 cards  
  - 3 players: remove 10 cards  
  - 4 players: remove 8 cards  
- Shuffle the dragon cards into the bottom half of the remaining Dragonwood deck.  
- Reveal 5 Dragonwood cards face up to form the Landscape. Replace any Event cards revealed by reshuffling them and drawing new ones.  
- Shuffle the Adventurer deck and deal 5 cards to each player. Place the rest face down as a draw pile; place discard piles nearby.  
- Place the 6 dice and turn summary cards within reach.

4. Gameplay Flow  
- Play proceeds clockwise, starting with the last player to hike into the woods.  
- On your turn, choose one action:  
  a) **Reload**: Draw 1 card from the Adventurer deck.  
    - If you draw a Lucky Ladybug, discard it immediately and draw 2 replacement cards.  
    - Hand limit is 9 cards. If at 9, draw then discard 1.  
  b) **Capture**: Attempt to capture a face-up card in the Landscape using Strike, Stomp, or Scream.  
    - Announce target and method.  
    - Play qualifying Adventurer cards from hand.  
    - Roll one die per card played (max 6 dice).  
    - Add any Enhancement bonuses.  
    - Compare total to required value on card (by symbol: sword=Strike, boot=Stomp, face=Scream).  
    - If total meets or exceeds requirement, capture the card.  
      - Creatures: place in victory pile (face down).  
      - Enhancements: keep in front of you for ongoing use.  
      - Discard all used Adventurer cards.  
    - If failed: discard 1 card as a "wound"; return unplayed cards to hand.  
- After a successful capture:  
  - Replace the captured card with the top card from the Dragonwood deck.  
  - If an Event card is drawn, resolve its effect immediately, discard it, and draw a replacement.  
- Turn ends after action.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Strike**: Play cards in numerical sequence (e.g., 4, 5, 6), any colors.  
- **Stomp**: Play cards with the same number (e.g., three 7s).  
- **Scream**: Play cards of the same color (e.g., five reds).  
- **Single Card**: May be used as any type (Strike, Stomp, Scream), earns 1 die.  
- **Enhancements**: Provide passive bonuses (e.g., +2 to Strike). Cannot be used to capture other Enhancements.  
- **Events**: Affect all players immediately. Examples:  
  - Thunderstorm: each player discards 1 Adventurer card.  
  - Wind Storm: each player discards 1 card, then draws 1.  
- **Lucky Ladybug**: When drawn during a reload, discard and draw 2 extra cards.  
- **Deck Cycling**: When Adventurer deck is exhausted, shuffle discard pile to form a new draw pile. This may happen multiple times.

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends if either:  
- Both dragons are defeated, or  
- The Adventurer deck has been fully cycled through twice (each player gets one final turn after second cycle).  

Scoring:  
- Add VP from all captured Creature cards.  
- Bonus: 3 VP to player who captured the most Creature cards (ties: 2 VP each).  
- Enhancements give no VP.  
- Tiebreaker: Player who captured the Orange Dragon wins.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I use Enhancements when capturing Enhancements?**  
  No. Enhancements cannot be used to capture other Enhancements.  
- **Can I attempt multiple captures per turn?**  
  No. Only one capture attempt per turn.  
- **What happens if I roll more than 6 dice?**  
  You cannot. Maximum of 6 dice may be rolled.  
- **Do captured Enhancements stack?**  
  Yes. Multiple Enhancements can be used simultaneously.  
- **What if the Dragonwood deck runs out?**  
  Landscape remains at fewer than 5 cards. No replacement.  
- **Can I use a Dragon Spell?**  
  Optional variant: Discard 3 cards of same color and consecutive numbers to attempt a Dragon Spell (roll 2 dice; need 6+ to defeat a dragon). Only usable on dragons.
