## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
EuroRails is a strategic train-based board game where players transport goods between European cities to earn points. The objective is to deliver goods from their city of origin to distant demand locations, earning payout points based on distance and scarcity. Players build rail lines, manage routes, and optimize deliveries to maximize scoring before the game ends.

2. Components  
- Map of Europe with city connections  
- Train pieces (per player)  
- Goods cards indicating origin, type, and payout  
- City list with locations across Europe  
- Distance and cost table for routes  
- Payout reference for goods based on delivery  

3. Setup  
- Each player chooses a color and takes corresponding trains.  
- Place the map board; all routes are initially neutral.  
- Shuffle goods cards and deal a starting hand (exact number not specified).  
- Players begin in major cities (e.g., London, Paris, Berlin) — starting positions not fully defined.  
- Determine turn order (not specified).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. On a turn, a player may:  
   - Build a rail segment (cost based on distance; cities connected incrementally)  
   - Deliver a good from its origin to a demand city via owned rail routes  
   - Draw new goods cards (if allowed)  
2. Rail segments connect adjacent cities; players claim routes by building trains along them.  
3. Delivery: A player must control a continuous path from good’s origin to its demand city.  
4. After action, turn passes clockwise.  

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Route Building**: Players spend points or resources (implied by cost) to claim routes between cities. Route cost equals distance value (e.g., Torino–Marseille = 15).  
- **Goods Delivery**: Each good has:  
   - **Origin city** (e.g., Beer from München)  
   - **Demand location** (e.g., France, Germany, etc.)  
   - **Payout**: Increases with distance delivered (exact formula not given, but implied)  
- **Goods Types & Origins**:  
   - Bauxite: Budapest (HU), France, ?  
   - Beer: Dublin (IE), Frankfurt (DE), München (DE), Praha (CZ)  
   - Cars: Manchester (UK), Stuttgart (DE), Torino (IT)  
   - Cheese: Arhus (DK), Bern (CH), Holla (NL), Kobenhavn (DK)  
   - Chocolate: Bruxelles (BE), Zürich (CH)  
   - Coal: Cardiff (UK), Kraków (PL), Wrocław (PL)  
   - Cork: Portugal, Sevilla (ES)  
   - Fish: Aberdeen (UK), Oslo (NO), Porto (PT)  
   - Oranges: Sevilla (ES), Valencia (ES)  
   - Potatoes: Belfast (UK), Łódź (PL), Szczecin (PL)  
   - Sheep: Bilbao (ES), Cork (IE), Glasgow (UK)  
   - Steel: Birmingham (UK), Luxembourg (LU), Ruhr (DE)  
   - Tobacco: Napoli (IT)  
   - Tourists: London (UK), Ruhr (DE)  
   - Wine: Bordeaux (FR), Frankfurt (DE), Porto (PT), Wien (AT)  
   - Wood: Oslo (NO), Sarajevo (BA), Stockholm (SE)  
   - Marble: Firenze (IT)  
   - China: Birmingham (UK), Leipzig (DE)  
   - Cattle: Nantes (FR), Switzerland, France  
   - Copper: Serbia, Poland  
   - Bauxite: Budapest (HU)  
   - sh: Scotland, Norway, Portugal  
- **Delivery Rules**:  
   - A good must be delivered from its origin city to a demand zone (country or region).  
   - Payout increases with distance (e.g., longer route = more points).  
   - Example: Beer from Dublin to Germany pays more if routed longer (but must be efficient).  

6. Scoring & End Game  
- Players score payout points when delivering goods.  
- Payout values: Most goods have 3–4 units available; scarcity may affect value.  
- Game ends when:  
   - A player places a certain number of trains (not specified), OR  
   - A set number of deliveries are made (not specified)  
- Final scoring: Total delivery payouts. Highest score wins.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Multiple Origins**: Some goods (e.g., Beer, Wine) have multiple origins — any can be used for delivery.  
- **Ambiguous Cities**: “Holla” likely refers to Netherlands; “K Krakow” likely Kraków; “Lódź” and “Łódź” are same.  
- **Country vs City Demand**: Some demands are countries (e.g., Spain, Germany), meaning any city in that country may serve as destination (if connected).  
- **Via Routes**: Some paths require intermediate cities (e.g., Newcastle to Aberdeen via Glasgow = 17 cost).  
- **Route Ownership**: Only one player can claim a route; blocks opponent access.
