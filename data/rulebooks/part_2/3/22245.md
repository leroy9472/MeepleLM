## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In *Royal Visit*, players compete to attract the King to their Chateau. The valley celebrates the King’s visit, and prestige awaits the family whose estate he visits. Using the powers of the Wizard and Jester, players maneuver characters to entice the King or influence the Crown token. The first player to have either the King or the Crown enter their Chateau wins immediately. If neither achieves this, the game ends when the draw pile is exhausted for the second time, and victory is determined by the King’s or Crown’s position.

2. Components  
- 1 game board (divided into two Duchies, separated by a central Fountain space; each end has a two-space Chateau)  
- 1 Crown token (with two sides: Big Crown and Little Crown)  
- 5 character pawns:  
  - King  
  - 2 Guards  
  - Wizard  
  - Jester  
- 54 cards (four types: King, Guard, Wizard, Jester)

3. Setup  
1. Place the board between players so each faces their Chateau.  
2. Place the King on the central Fountain space.  
3. Place one Guard on each adjacent space to the King (one on each side).  
4. One player holds the Wizard and Jester in separate hands; the other chooses one. The chosen figure goes to that player’s side (on the empty space between the Fountain and their Chateau); the other goes to the opposite side.  
5. Shuffle the deck and deal 8 cards face-down to each player.  
6. Place the remaining cards face-down as the draw pile.  
7. Place the Crown token with the **Big Crown side up** on the middle space of the Crown Track (aligned with the Fountain).  
8. The player with the **Wizard in their Duchy** (between Fountain and their Chateau) takes the first turn.

4. Gameplay Flow  
On your turn, perform these three actions in order:  
1. **Play a type of card or use a power**  
2. **Move the Crown**  
3. **Refill your hand**

1. Play a Type of Card or Use a Power  
You must choose one of the following:

a. **Play one or more cards of the same type**  
- Play any number of cards of a single type (e.g., multiple Guard cards).  
- Cards are resolved one at a time.  
- You cannot play a card if the full movement cannot be completed.  
- Played cards are discarded face-up.

Card Types:  
- **King (1)**: Move the King one space.  
  - *King’s Privilege*: Play two King cards to move the **entire Court** (King and both Guards) one space in the same direction. This is the only case where multiple cards combine into one movement.  
- **Guard (1)**: Move one Guard one space.  
- **Guard (1+1)**: Move both Guards one space each, OR move one Guard two spaces.  
- **Guard (≪≫)**: Move both Guards to the two spaces adjacent to the King (one on each side).  
- **Wizard (1, 2, or 3)**: Move the Wizard 1, 2, or 3 spaces.  
- **Jester (1–5)**: Move the Jester 1 to 5 spaces.  
- **Jester (M)**: Move the Jester to the central Fountain space.

b. **Use a Power (instead of playing cards)**  
- **Wizard’s Power**: Move the King or one Guard to the Wizard’s current space.  
  - Must maintain that the King is between the two Guards.  
  - Cannot summon the Jester.  
- **Jester’s Power**: If the Jester is between your Chateau and the King, you may use Jester cards as wilds to move any one type of character (King, Guard, Wizard, or Jester). Conditions:  
  - All Jester cards played this turn must move the **same type** of character.  
  - You cannot play any non-Jester cards this turn.  
  - If moving the King with Jester cards, the Jester must **remain between your Chateau and the King** after each move.  
  - The Jester cannot move itself using this power.

2. Move the Crown  
Move the Crown token along the Crown Track toward your Chateau:  
- **1 space** for each character (King, Guard, Wizard, Jester) currently in your Chateau (two spaces at your end).  
- **1 additional space** if the **entire Court** (King and both Guards) is in your Duchy (your side of the Fountain).  
These effects are cumulative.

3. Refill Your Hand  
Draw cards from the draw pile until you have 8 cards.  
- When the draw pile is exhausted, shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile and **flip the Crown token to its Little Crown side**.  
- If the draw pile runs out a second time (i.e., after the Crown has already been flipped), the game ends after this turn.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **The Court**: The King and two Guards. The King must always be between the Guards, but not necessarily adjacent. The King and Guards cannot occupy the same space.  
- **Shared Control**: Characters are neutral; either player can move them.  
- **Crown Movement**: Determined at the end of each turn based on character positions.  
- **Card Play**: Only one card type per turn unless using Jester’s wild power.  
- **Powers**: Wizard and Jester offer special movement options, replacing card play.

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately if:  
- The **King** enters any space of a player’s Chateau.  
- The **Crown** enters any space of a player’s Chateau.  
→ That player wins immediately.

If the draw pile is exhausted for the **second time** (after the Crown has been flipped once):  
- The player with the **King in their Duchy** (on their side of the Fountain) wins.  
- If the King is on the **Fountain (central space)**, the player with the **Crown on their side of the Crown Track** wins.  
- If both the King and Crown are on the central space, there is **no winner**.

Note: If the King is on the Fountain when the draw pile runs out the first time, shuffle and continue.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can the King and a Guard occupy the same space?**  
  No. The King and Guards must always be on different spaces, with the King between them.

- **Can multiple characters occupy the same space?**  
  Yes, except for the King and Guards, which must remain on separate spaces.

- **Can I use Jester cards to move the Jester itself using the Jester’s power?**  
  No. The Jester’s power allows using Jester cards as wilds for **other** characters, not for moving the Jester.

- **What if I play a Jester M card to move the Jester to the center, but it breaks the “between” condition?**  
  You can still play it. The “between” condition only applies when **using** the Jester’s wild power during a turn.

- **Can I use the Wizard’s power and then play a card?**  
  No. Using a power replaces playing cards. You do only one of: play cards, use Wizard power, or use Jester wild cards.

- **What happens if the Crown is already on the edge and would move further?**  
  The Crown moves one space per scoring condition. It can reach the Chateau spaces and win the game.

- **Can I play a single Jester card as a wild without using the full power?**  
  No. To use Jester cards as wilds, you must use **only** Jester cards this turn, all for the same character type.
