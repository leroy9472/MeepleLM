## Keltis: Way of Stones – Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Keltis: Way of Stones is a strategic card-driven board game where players guide their figures along colored paths (Suits) across a mystical board, aiming to reach the Goal Area and score the most points. Players build sequences of numbered cards to advance their figures along stone paths, collecting special tiles and optimizing their scoring potential. The game ends when five figures total (across all players) reach the Goal Area or when the draw pile is exhausted. Victory is determined by final point totals.

### 2. Components  
- A game board with five colored paths (Suits), each containing Stone Spaces numbered from 1 to 10 and special Path Tiles  
- Cards in five Suits, numbered 1–10  
- Player hands (start with 8 cards)  
- Draw pile (face-down deck)  
- Five face-up discard piles (one per Suit)  
- Player figures: each player has multiple figures (including at least one large figure)  
- Starting Spaces (medium and large) for each player  
- Path Tiles: Number Tiles, Clover Leaf Tiles, and Wishing Stones  
- Scoring Track (for tracking points; supports lapping)  

### 3. Setup  
- Each player selects a starting side and places their figures on the Starting Spaces.  
- Shuffle the deck and deal 8 cards to each player.  
- Place the remaining deck face-down as the draw pile.  
- Create five empty discard piles next to the board, one for each Suit.  
- Ensure the board paths are visible, with Stone Spaces and Path Tiles in place.  

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise, beginning with the first player. On each turn, a player performs exactly two actions in order:

#### 1. Play 1 Card from Hand  
You may either:
- Play a card into one of your Paths (by Suit), or  
- Discard a card to a discard pile  

**Playing a Card into a Path:**
- Each Suit corresponds to one Path on the board and one column in front of you.
- You may have only one Path (column) per Suit.

**Starting a New Path:**
- If no cards of that Suit are in play, place the card face-up to start a new column.
- Move one of your figures from a Starting Space onto the first Stone of the matching Suit path on the board.
- Resolve the effect of the Path Tile landed on (if any).

**Adding to an Existing Path:**
- Place the card face-up below previous cards in the column (values remain visible).
- Advance the figure on that Suit’s path by one space.
- After the second card is played, the direction (ascending or descending) of the run is fixed:
  - You may continue in the same direction or stay the same (equal value).
  - You may not reverse direction.
  - Gaps between numbers are allowed.
  - Duplicate numbers are allowed.

**Special Case – Path Already at End Stone (10):**
- If your figure has already reached the 10 space on a path, playing another card of that Suit allows you to advance **any one** of your other figures by 1 space (instead of advancing the figure on that path).

**Resolving Path Tile Effects:**
When a figure lands on a Path Tile, resolve its effect immediately:
- **Number Tile**: Score the indicated number of points. Tile remains.
- **Clover Leaf**: Advance one of your figures (this or another) by 1 space. If it lands on another Path Tile, resolve that effect too.
- **Wishing Stone**: Take the tile and place it in front of you (counts for final scoring). Tile is removed from the board.

**Discarding a Card:**
- Discard one card from your hand face-up to the discard pile corresponding to its Suit.
- All players may draw from any of the five discard piles later.

#### 2. Draw 1 Card  
After playing or discarding, draw one card to restore your hand to 8 cards. Choose from:
- The top of the face-down draw pile, or  
- The top card of any face-up discard pile (by Suit)

### 5. Core Mechanics  
- **Path Construction**: Build ascending or descending runs in each Suit. Direction locks after second card.
- **Figure Movement**: Each card played advances a figure one space along its path (unless path is complete).
- **Tile Effects**: Trigger immediate benefits when landing on special tiles.
- **Wishing Stones**: Collected during play; provide variable endgame points.
- **Hand Management**: Balance playing key cards vs. enabling future draws from discard piles.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  
#### Game End Triggers (either ends the game immediately):
1. The **fifth figure total** (across all players) enters the Goal Area.
   - The Goal Area includes Stone Spaces worth 6, 7, and 10 points.
   - Suit of the path does not matter.
   - Effects of Path Tiles landed on during this final move are **not resolved**.
2. The last card is drawn from the face-down draw pile.

#### Final Scoring:
All players score simultaneously:
- **Each figure on a path** scores the point value shown next to its current Stone Space.
  - **Large figure** scores **double** the value shown.
  - Figures still on Starting Space score 0.
- **Wishing Stones**: Score based on quantity collected:
  - 0 stones: –4 points  
  - 1 stone: –3 points  
  - 2 stones: –2 points  
  - 3 stones: +3 points  
  - 4 stones: +6 points  
  - 5 or more stones: +10 points  

Total all components. Player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, all tied players share victory.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I change direction after starting a run?**  
  No. Once two cards are played in a path, the run direction (ascending, descending, or flat) is fixed. Subsequent cards must not reverse direction.

- **Can I have multiple columns of the same Suit?**  
  No. You may have only one Path (column) per Suit.

- **What happens if I play a card to a completed path (already at 10)?**  
  Instead of advancing that figure, you may advance **any one** of your other figures by 1 space.

- **Can I discard and then draw the same card?**  
  Yes, but only if it goes to the discard pile and is the top card when you draw.

- **Do I resolve Path Tile effects when entering the Goal Area at game end?**  
  No. If the fifth figure lands on a Path Tile when entering the Goal Area, its effect is ignored.

- **Can I use a Clover Leaf to advance a figure already in the Goal Area?**  
  Yes, but it has no further effect (figures cannot go beyond the 10 space).

- **Can I play a card to start a new path even if I have figures in play?**  
  Yes. Starting a new path uses one of your available figures from the Starting Space.
