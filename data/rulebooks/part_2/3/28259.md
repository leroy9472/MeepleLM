## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
Cutthroat Caverns is a competitive dungeon-crawling card game where players take on the roles of adventurers battling deadly creatures in a treacherous cavern. The goal is to earn the most Prestige Points by landing killing blows on creatures and completing special encounter conditions. Players compete individually, using tactical card play, bluffing, and sabotage to outscore rivals — cooperation is temporary and self-serving.

The game ends when the final encounter is defeated. The player with the most Prestige Points wins. In case of a tie, a sudden-death encounter breaks the tie.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Cards  
- **Attack Cards (Red icon)**:  
  - Deal damage. Values can be halved (rotate down) or doubled (rotate up).  
  - **Special Attacks**: Higher damage for character pictured. Protected once revealed (immune to unwanted Action cards). Optional to use.  
  - **Enhanced Attacks**: Have additional effects (e.g., Strike of Destiny).  
  - **Tactical Maneuvers**: No damage (e.g., Feint).  
  - **Stand In Cards** (e.g., Double Strike): Replaced immediately when revealed. Only final card is affected by modifiers.  
  - **Riders** (e.g., Focus Strength): Modify next Attack. Stay in front of character until used.  
    - Multiple additive Riders allowed. Only one multiplicative Rider per attack.  
    - Rotate both cards if modified. Count as single attack.  
  - **Edge Out**: Targets any facedown Attack card (except second Opportunity Fire card).

- **Action Cards (Blue icon)**:  
  - Played from hand, sometimes out of turn.  
  - Examples: *Not So Tough* (reduce attack), *Tougher Than He Looks* (increase attack).  
  - Priority: If multiple players play simultaneously, Initiative 1 acts first.

- **Item Cards (Jewel icon)**:  
  - Placed faceup beside character when drawn. Not in hand.  
  - **Potions**: “Tipped to drink” (rotated 90° clockwise). Cannot be stolen after tipping.  
    - Healing Potions used on others grant Prestige.  
  - **One-use**: Potions, Alchemist Fire removed after use.  
  - Can be used in player negotiations.

#### Character Abilities (Deeper & Darker)  
- Each character has unique ability. Declare use; takes effect immediately.  
- Associated attacks are immune to unwanted Action cards (except from Round 7 onward).  
- If conflict (e.g., Talon vs. Orn), first to declare wins; tie broken by Initiative.

#### Events & Relics (Relics & Ruin)  
- **Event Deck**: Draw Event card when revealing creature-based encounter.  
  - If encounter number matches Activation track, activate Event.  
  - Events! resolve immediately. Measures! at end of encounter.  
- **Relic Cards**: Earned via Events. Function as persistent Items. Can be affected by Item-interaction cards.

#### Poison  
- Poison token: -5 LP per token at end of each round; -10 damage per token on all attacks.  
- Cumulative.  
- Remove **one** token per player at end of each encounter.  
- Cannot prevent poison damage once inflicted.

#### Token-Based Encounters  
- **Undead (Endless Horde of Dead)**:  
  - Token starts Approaching (no attack). Flip to Attacking next round.  
  - Players may attack any Undead in play once current encounter is defeated.  
  - Use +1 Prestige tokens if out of Undead tokens.  
- **Protospores (Treasure Spore)**:  
  - Heal Treasure Spore 30 LP each at end of round.  
  - Attack Player #1 in next Initiative draw.  
  - If Treasure Spore “dies” with Protospores, heal 30 LP per discarded token instead.

#### Special Encounters  
- **Vampyre**: Player becomes Vampyre; damages chosen player for 5 LP per round. Not a creature. Reverts if Vampyre dies.  
- **Wereboar**: Player becomes creature; cannot win via Prestige. Wins only by killing all others.  
- **Emperor Lich (Boss)**:  
  1. Fight skeleton per player.  
  2. Fight dead players (as creatures, no Initiative, attack end of round).  
  3. Fight Lich (only part granting Bonus Prestige).  
- **Hivemind**: If *I Think He Called You Ugly Too* played, targeted token splits and attacks named player.  
- **Thantigist**: Physically switch seats; take other player’s hand, LP, Prestige, Items.  
- **Ragnarok**: May bring back dead players. Cannot pick who; optional.  
- **Barrier Magus**: If barrier up, attacks; if down, raises barrier instead. Barrier knockdown is not a creature attack (no Counter Strike).  
- **Blink Dogs**: Attack immediately when played; attack again when moved. Can be redirected with *I Think He Called You Ugly Too*.  
- **Cursed Naiad/Spitting Drake**: Use Hold/Strike cards. Hide under Attack card; reveal with attack.  
- **Shadowmancer**: First round normal. In subsequent rounds, new Player #1 must beat previous Player #1’s attack or lose turn.

#### New Main Deck Cards  
- **Strike and Evade**: If character portrait on card, play for double damage and Protected. Creature ignores you that round.  
- **Strike of Destiny**: Protected Attack for any character. Max damage 35 (cannot rotate higher). Edge Out legal but costly.  
- **If I Can't Have It**: Ensures another shot next turn.  
- **Impressive Move**: “Single attack” = separate attack.  
- **Snicker-Snackt**: Enables 60+ damage attack. Only cards with printed attack value count.  
- **Takin' One For The Team**: Gain Prestige by taking attack meant for another. Damage cannot be redirected.  
- **Unwitting Assist**: Change another player’s Attack card (remains their attack).

#### Custom Characters (Tombs & Tomes)  
- **Pre-Generated**: Use themed Reputations. LP already adjusted.  
- **Custom Draft**:  
  - **Quick Draft**: Deal 5 Reputations; choose any number (pay LP cost).  
  - **Standard Draft**: Deal 5, choose one, pass rest left. Repeat until all chosen. Then decide which to use.  
- Starting LP = 100 minus total cost of chosen Reputations. Cannot heal above starting LP.

#### Winning the Game  
- Game ends when last encounter is defeated.  
- Highest Prestige wins.  
- **Tie**: Draw random Encounter card (from set-aside stack) and play sudden-death encounter. Repeat until tie broken.

#### Dead Players  
- Player is out. Remove their highest Initiative card from game.  
- **Looting**: At end of encounter, draw Initiative. In order, players may take one Item from dead player.
