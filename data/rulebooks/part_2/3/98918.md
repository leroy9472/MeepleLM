# Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In Bios: Genesis, players represent fundamental forces of life (Metabolism, Specificity, Energy Absorption, Heredity) guiding the emergence and evolution of life on Earth from primordial conditions. Starting with simple chemical systems (Refugia), players seed environments, catalyze the formation of the first life (Bacteria), and guide evolution through microorganisms to marine and terrestrial macroorganisms. The objective is to score the most Victory Points (VP) by the end of the game through biological dominance, organism complexity, and ecosystem positioning.

## 2. Components
- **16 Wooden Bionts (4 per player)**: Player-specific control tokens. Represent a player's influence in a Refugium or organism. Score 1 VP each in organisms.
- **64 Wooden Cubes (Chromosomes/Manna)**: Generic components used as Manna in Refugia and as Chromosomes (Mutation cubes, Organ cubes, System Chromosomes) in organisms.
- **48 Plastic Disks (Catalysts)**: Act as currency. Used as Enzymes in Refugia, Antioxidants/Vitamins in organisms, and for purchases.
- **16 Refugia Placards**: Double-sided cards. Front is a Refugium (environment); back is a Bacterium (microorganism).
- **24 Event Cards**: Drive the game's climate, landform activation, and crises. Divided into Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic eons.
- **20 Mutation Cards**: Double-sided cards (unpromoted RNA/promoted DNA) that grant abilities to microorganisms.
- **8 Macroorganism Cards**: Represent marine and terrestrial complex life (e.g., Trilobites, Insects).
- **4 Parasite Cards**: Player-specific cards for parasitism mechanics.
- **4 Landform Cards**: Track active/inactive Landforms (Cosmic, Ocean, Coastal, Continent).
- **12 Six-sided Dice (d6)**: Used for Autocatalytic and Darwin Rolls.
- **Soup**: A central pool for unused cubes and disks.

## 3. Setup
1. **Player Setup**: Randomly assign colors. Each player takes 4 Bionts (3 in 4-player), 1 Catalyst of their color, and 1 Parasite card.
2. **Soup**: Place all cubes and remaining Catalysts in a central pool.
3. **Event Deck**: Shuffle 3 Hadean cards on top of all Archean cards, on top of 10 Proterozoic cards (7 for short game). Place face down.
4. **Landforms & Refugia**: 
   - Separate 16 Refugia placards into 4 decks by Landform (3 Cosmic, 3 Ocean, 5 Coastal, 5 Continent).
   - Shuffle each deck. Stack them in a column: Cosmic (top), Ocean, Coastal, Continent (bottom).
   - Place the corresponding Landform card on top of each deck, inactive (dim) side up.
5. **Mutation Decks**: Shuffle 20 Mutation cards. Create 4 decks of 5 cards each, unpromoted (RNA) side up. Place one deck to the left of each Refugia deck.
6. **Macroorganisms**: Place the 8 Macroorganism cards in a public stack.
7. **Player Tableaus**: Each player has an area for their pool of unassigned Bionts and Catalysts.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
The game proceeds in rounds, one per Event card, with five phases:

### Phase 1: Event
1. **Reveal Event**: Draw the top Event card.
2. **Aftershock**: If the card has an Aftershock icon, draw and combine the next non-Aftershock Event. Apply effects in order.
3. **Player Order**: The leftmost color on the Event card is first player. Skip unused colors. Play proceeds left-to-right. Parasites act after their Host.
4. **Wanton First Player**: A player with the most HGT icons on their Bionted organisms may declare themselves first player for any phase.
5. **Activate Landforms**: Flip Landform cards to active (bright) or inactive (dim) as shown on the Event.
6. **Roil Mutation Decks**: For each active Landform, move the top card of its adjacent Mutation deck to the bottom.
7. **Apply Event Icons**: From left to right:
   - **Heaven/Earth**: Draw a Refugium from the topmost/bottommost active deck. Set up Disorganized Manna.
   - **Extremophile Crisis**: All organisms suffer Atrophies equal to the sum of icons minus their Heat Shields (red cubes/Bionts, Heat Shield icons).
   - **Oxygen Spike**: All organisms suffer Atrophies equal to the sum of icons minus their Antioxidant Shields (green cubes/Bionts, Antioxidant/Vitamin disks, O2 Shield icons). Antioxidants/Vitamins may be discarded to prevent Atrophies.
   - **UV Radiation**: Organisms without UV Shield must discard Mutations/Organs down to the number specified. Without Immunology, lose healthy ones first.
   - **Cancer**: All macroorganisms make a Cancer Roll (like Darwin Roll). Atrophy on '5' or '6'; '1' generates a Catalyst. Cancer Shield reduces Atrophy to only '6'.
   - **Drought**: Terrestrial macroorganisms without Drought Shield suffer one Atrophy.
   - **Smite**: Refugia without Resiliency lose an Enzyme or, if none, the leftmost Manna cube (disorganized before organized). If no cubes remain, remove the Refugium; Bionts return without compensation.
   - **Global Temperature**: Track climate (Warm/Cool). Four of the same in a row triggers Armageddon.
8. **Armageddon Check**: If the last four climate icons are identical, a vote is held. All players vote Gaia (save) or Medea (end). If all vote Gaia, each player discards 1 Catalyst or suffers 1 Atrophy. If any vote Medea, the game ends.

### Phase 2: Assignment
In player order, players may assign Bionts and Catalysts.
- **Assign Bionts to Tableau**: Reclaim a Biont to your pool.
- **Assign Bionts/Enzymes to Refugium**:
  - **Valid Target**: Refugium in an active row, OR a row where you have a Biont (in a Refugium or organism with that home row), OR any row if a Bionted organism has Spore.
  - **Entropy Limit**: Maximum Bionts you can assign to Refugia is 1 + the number of green Chromosomes in the organism with the most green Chromosomes where you have a Biont.
  - **Deep Hot Biosphere**: Costs 1 Catalyst per Biont assigned.
- **Assign Antioxidants**: Place Catalysts on Bacteria or marine macroorganisms. Green = Vitamin (adds to shield and can be discarded); others = Antioxidant (can be discarded).
- **Assign Parasite to Host**: Attach your Parasite card to a foreign organism. Steal 1-2 Mutation/Organ cubes as Diseased cubes. Host must have a valid cube to steal and be in a valid row.
- **Supplanting**: Replace another player's Parasite if you can steal more Diseased cubes than it currently has. The supplanted Parasite may immediately reattach.
- **HGT (Horizontal Gene Transfer)**: If a Bionted organism has the HGT icon, you may move one of your Bionts from any microorganism to another microorganism, a Refugium, or your pool. Can be blocked by a player with more HGT icons.

### Phase 3: Autocatalytic Rolls
For each Refugium with Bionts, roll from top to bottom, left to right.
- **Contested Refugium**: If multiple Biont colors, the player with the most (Organized Manna + Enzymes) of their color is the Progenote. They roll and make decisions. Ties broken by Manna Structure.
- **Roll Dice**: 2 dice per Biont, 1 die per organized Manna cube.
- **Animation**: For each die matching the Life Die face (based on current climate), move one Disorganized Manna cube to Organized.
- **Death and Biosynthesis**:
  - **Manna Death**: For each die matching an uncovered Enzyme space, remove one Organized Manna (cube or Biont). A returned Biont grants compensation (1 Catalyst of its color). A returned cube generates a Catalyst of the same color (given to roller if uncontested, Progenote if contested).
  - **Enzyme Death**: For each die matching an uncovered Enzyme space, return the rightmost Enzyme to the soup.
- **Create Darwinian Life**: If doubles are rolled and a Biont remains, the roller (or Progenote) may flip the Refugium into a Bacterium. Use all Organized Manna and Bionts as Chromosomes.

### Phase 4: Darwin Rolls
In player order, each player rolls for their microorganisms. Parasites roll after their Host.
- **Roll Dice**: 2 dice per Biont, 1 die per Chromosome cube (including Mutation cubes).
- **Specificity Re-rolls**: Re-roll one die per yellow Chromosome.
- **Biosynthesis**: Earn 1 Catalyst for each triple rolled + 1 Catalyst per red Chromosome for each '1' rolled. Color determined by the organism's Metabolism.
- **Error Catastrophe**: Each '5' or '6' is an error. Each blue Chromosome blocks one error. Unblocked errors cause Atrophies. With DNA ability, only '6' is an error.

### Phase 5: Purchases
In player order, make one purchase per Biont in an organism. Parasites purchase after their Host.
- **Fission**: If the organism started the round with Fission, each Biont allows two purchases.
- **Cost**: 1 Catalyst from the organism's tableau pool. Color rules:
  - Mutation/Organ: Must match the card/cube color.
  - Marine Macroorganism: Any color.
  - Red Queen: Must match the stolen cube's color.
  - **Chemoselectivity**: Pay 2 Catalysts of one color as any other.
  - **Chameleon**: Pay 1 Catalyst of any color.
- **Purchase Options**:
  - **New Mutation**: Buy the top card from a Mutation deck in an active row or the organism's home row (any row with Spore). Attach card and add a cube.
  - **Promote Mutation**: Pay to flip an existing Mutation to its promoted side. Add a second cube.
  - **Marine Macroorganism**: Spend any color Catalyst and discard the required Chromosome cubes. The Bacterium becomes a marine macroorganism.
  - **New Organ**: Spend a Catalyst to add an Organ cube to a marine macroorganism.
  - **Red Queen**: Attack Host/Parasite. Steal a Diseased/Healthy cube or a Biont. Requires Red Queen ability and permission or icon advantage.
- **Pollution**: If a Mutation or Parasite has "Pollution!", an O2 Spike attack occurs against organisms in the same home row.
- **Trophic Level**: After all purchases, rearrange marine/terrestrial macroorganisms by metabolic rate (red + yellow Chromosomes) for Plant, Herbivore, Carnivore.
- **Landfall**: A marine macroorganism with all Organs filled flips to terrestrial, discarding Organs and Antioxidants.

## 5. Core Mechanics
- **Bionts**: Control tokens. Used for influence, purchases, and scoring.
- **Catalysts**: Currency. Used for purchases, as Enzymes, Antioxidants, and for Armageddon.
- **Atrophy**: Loss of a Chromosome (cube or Biont). Order: Mutation/Organ cubes > Chromosome/Endosymbiont Bionts > Trophic Biont. Immunology allows choice.
- **Entropy Limit**: Restricts Bionts on Refugia. Starts at 1, increases by green Chromosomes.
- **Home Row**: A microorganism's Landform; a macroorganism's ecosystem (Ocean/Continent); a Parasite's Host's home row.
- **Contested Refugium**: Multiple players' Bionts. Progenote has control.
- **Compensation**: Receiving a Catalyst when a Biont is returned due to Manna Death, Atrophy, or Extinction.
- **Extinction**: Losing the last Biont. Bacteria become trophies; macroorganisms resurrect as their Bacterium ancestor.

## 6. Scoring & End Game
The game ends when the last Event card is drawn or Armageddon occurs.
- **Cube VP**: 1 VP per cube on your organisms (including System Chromosomes).
- **Biont VP**: 1 VP per Biont of your color in any organism.
- **Trophy VP**: 1 VP per extinct organism card/placard.
- **Trophic Dominance**: 6 VP per macroorganism, or 12 VP if it is at the highest Trophic Level. Points split equally among players with Bionts (round down).
- **Total**: Sum all VP categories.
- **Tiebreaker**: Most Catalysts. If still tied, shared victory.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **HGT Block**: A player with more HGT icons can block a move to their microorganism. The Biont must move elsewhere, but the HGT action is used.
- **Commandeering**: If your microorganism loses all your Bionts but has Foreign Genes, the player with the remaining Bionts takes control.
- **Parasite Extinction**: A Parasite goes extinct if it loses its last Biont or its Host goes extinct.
- **Overcrowding**: If 4 marine macroorganisms exist, each may attempt Landfall. If still overcrowded, the lowest metabolic rate organism goes extinct.
- **Yellow Player**: Can perform Red Queen attacks against Parasites at no cost.
- **Refugia Removal**: If a Refugium has no cubes, it is removed; Bionts return without compensation.
