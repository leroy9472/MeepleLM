## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
*Archaeology: The Card Game* is a competitive card game of treasure hunting, risk, and strategy. Players take on the roles of rival archaeologists racing to uncover valuable artifacts from ancient Egyptian ruins, while avoiding hazards like sandstorms and thieves. The goal is to amass the highest total value of artifacts sold to the Museum. In case of a tie, the player who sold fewer total cards wins.

   - Map cards
2. Shuffle the remaining cards and:

5. Shuffle the remaining Sandstorm, Thief, and Map cards into the rest of the deck to form the **Dig Site** deck. Place it face down.

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
On a player’s turn, follow this sequence:

#### Phase 1: Draw from Dig Site (Optional until deck is empty)
- Draw the top card from the **Dig Site** deck and resolve immediately:
  - **Treasure Card**: Add to hand.
  - **Thief**:
    - Discard the Thief card face up.
    - Take **1 random card** from any other player’s hand into your own.
  - **Sandstorm**:
    - Reveal the Sandstorm card.
    - Starting with the player who drew it, each player **discards half their hand (rounded down)** to the Marketplace (face up).
    - After all players discard, the player who drew the Sandstorm **restarts their turn** (redraw from Dig Site and repeat Phase 1).

> Note: If the Dig Site is empty, skip this phase.

#### Phase 2: Take Actions (Any Order, Any Number)
Players may perform the following actions any number of times and in any order:

- **Trade at the Marketplace**  
  Trade any number of cards from hand for any number of cards in the Marketplace, provided the **total trade value of received cards ≤ total value of traded cards**. Any excess value is lost.

- **Explore the Pyramid**  
  Discard Map cards to claim a Pyramid chamber:
  - Discard **1 Map** → take the **3-card Small Chamber**
  - Discard **2 Maps** → take the **5-card Medium Chamber**
  - Discard **3 Maps** → take the **7-card Large Chamber**  
  > Each chamber may be explored **only once per game**. Discarded Maps are removed from the game.

- **Sell to the Museum**  
  Play a set of **1 or more identical treasure cards** from your hand. Place them face up in front of you in a new pile.  
  - Value is determined by the **sell chart** on the card (increases with set size).
  - You **cannot add cards** to a previously sold set.
  - You **cannot sell more cards than the max count** listed on the card (e.g., only 4 Pharaoh’s Masks exist).
  - You may sell **multiple sets** of the same type over the game.
  - **Sold cards are immune** to Thief and Sandstorm effects.

> After completing all desired actions, end your turn.

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Marketplace  
- Always contains **5 face-up cards** (refilled only via Sandstorm or other effects).
- Used for trading: compare total trade values (top number).
- Players may trade multiple cards in and out as long as value rule is followed.

#### Pyramid Exploration  
- One-time-only opportunities.
- Strategy involves timing Map use and anticipating opponent actions.
- Once a chamber is taken, it cannot be revisited.

#### Thief  
- Does not go into hand.
- Immediate effect: steal **1 random card** from any one player.
- Can be powerful mid-game when hands are large.

#### Sandstorm  
- Triggers mass discard: all players lose half their hand (rounded down).
- Discarded cards go to Marketplace (can be exploited).
- The triggering player **restarts their turn**, drawing again from Dig Site.

#### Selling Sets  
- Sets must be **identical cards**.
- Scoring uses the **sell-to-museum table** on each card (e.g., 1 Pot Shard = 1 point, 2 = 3 points, etc.).
- Sold cards are **permanently safe**.

### 6. Scoring & End Game  

#### Game End Conditions  
The game ends when **both** of the following are true:
1. The **Dig Site deck is empty**.
2. **All players have no cards in hand**.

#### Endgame Sequence  
- Once Dig Site is exhausted, players **no longer draw** at the start of their turn.
- Players may **pass** instead of taking actions.
- If **all players pass in succession**, the **first player who passed** must **sell at least one card** to the Museum when their turn comes around again.
- Play continues until all players have **0 cards in hand**.

#### Final Scoring  
1. Each player sums the **total value** of all sets they sold to the Museum.
2. The player with the **highest total** wins.
3. **Tiebreaker**: Among tied players, the one who sold the **fewest total number of cards** wins.

### 7. FAQ or Edge Cases  

**Q: Can I trade for more cards than I give, as long as value is equal or less?**  
A: Yes. You may trade one high-value card for multiple lower-value ones, as long as the total received value is ≤ given value.

**Q: Can I trade zero cards?**  
A: No. Trading requires at least one card given and one received.

**Q: What happens if the Dig Site runs out during a Sandstorm turn?**  
A: The player who drew the Sandstorm discards as normal, triggers discards from others, and then **restarts their turn** — but since Dig Site is empty, they skip drawing and proceed to actions.

**Q: Can I explore multiple Pyramid chambers in one turn?**  
A: Yes, if you have enough Maps and they haven’t been taken yet.

**Q: Are sold sets public?**  
A: Yes. All sold sets are placed face up in front of each player.

**Q: Can I sell a set larger than the max count on the card?**  
A: No. You cannot sell more copies than exist in the game (e.g., only 4 Pharaoh’s Masks exist, so maximum set size is 4).

**Q: What if I have no cards when it’s my turn?**  
A: You may pass. If Dig Site is empty, you wait until game end.

**Q: Do I have to sell if all others pass?**  
A: Only the **first player who passed** in a sequence must sell when play returns to them. Others may continue passing.
