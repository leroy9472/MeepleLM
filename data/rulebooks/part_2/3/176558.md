## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
The Godfather’s prized diamonds have been stolen during a heist. Players assume secret roles in a Cuban mafia setting, each with unique win conditions. The Godfather must recover all 15 diamonds to win. Others win based on their hidden roles—some by escaping detection, others by loyalty, sabotage, or elimination of key players.

2. Components  
- Diamond tokens (total: 15)  
- Character tokens (e.g., Henchman, Driver, CIA, FBI, Cleaner, Street Urchin, Diamond Lover, Revolutionary, Traitor, Minion, Crooked Lawyer)  
- One box for passing diamonds and tokens  
- One black/felt bag (for dismissed token)  
- Green Fake Diamond token (special role item)  
- Joker tokens (limited supply, used during investigation)

3. Setup  
- One player is designated The Godfather (role may shift during game).  
- The Godfather secretly removes 0–5 diamonds and hides them.  
- The remaining diamonds (10–15) are placed in the box.  
- The black/felt bag is given to the first player to the left of The Godfather.  
- The box is passed clockwise around the table for the Diamond Theft Phase.

4. Gameplay Flow  
**Phase 1: Diamond Theft**  
Players receive the box one by one and do the following:  
1. Count the diamonds in the box.  
2. Choose one action:  
   - (1) Steal any number of diamonds (becomes a Diamond Thief), or  
   - (2) Take one character token instead and leave the diamonds.  
   - Special cases:  
     - **First player**: May dismiss one character token into the black bag (keep it hidden) before taking diamonds or a token. Only one token may be dismissed; no diamonds allowed in the bag.  
     - **Last player**: May take nothing (0) to become a Street Urchin.  
     - **Empty box**: If a player receives an empty box, they automatically become a Street Urchin and must pretend to take something.  
3. Pass the box to the next player clockwise.

**Phase 2: Investigation**  
- The Godfather opens the box and knows how many diamonds are missing.  
- The Godfather interrogates players one at a time by saying: “Empty your pockets!”  
  - If the player is a thief and has diamonds:  
    - The Godfather reclaims the diamonds.  
    - The Godfather may continue to pick another player.  
  - If the player is not a thief:  
    - The Godfather gives them a Joker token and says, “I apologize.”  
    - Exception: No Joker is given if the player is CIA, FBI, Diamond Lover, or Revolutionary.  
  - If The Godfather has no Jokers left and selects a non-thief (except CIA/FBI/Diamond Lover/Revolutionary), the game ends immediately (GAME OVER).  

**Special Actions During Investigation:**  
- **The Cleaner**: At any point just before a player is about to reveal their role or diamonds, The Cleaner may shout “POW!” or “BANG!” to execute that player.  
  - If the executed player is CIA or FBI: The Cleaner wins alone immediately.  
  - If not: The Cleaner and the executed player are both eliminated.  
    - If the executed player was a thief, their diamonds are returned to The Godfather.  
    - No Joker is awarded to The Godfather for this action.  
- **Green Fake Diamond**:  
  - A player with this token may choose to take real diamonds (1) or become a Street Urchin (0).  
  - When selected by The Godfather, they must reveal the green fake diamond first.  
  - The Godfather may then choose to investigate them again with no penalty (no Joker cost).

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Role Revelation**: Most roles are revealed only when selected by The Godfather or through special actions (e.g., Cleaner’s execution).  
- **Win Triggers**:  
  - Immediate win:  
    - The Godfather recovers all 15 diamonds.  
    - The Godfather accuses a CIA or FBI agent (“EVERYBODY FREEZE!”) → that agent wins alone.  
    - The Cleaner successfully executes a CIA or FBI agent → The Cleaner wins alone.  
  - End-of-game win:  
    - Determined after investigation ends or GAME OVER.  
    - Thieves reveal their haul; highest uncaught thief wins (ties shared).  
- **Role Interactions**:  
  - **Driver**: Wins only if the player to their right wins.  
  - **Crooked Lawyer**:  
    - If a thief is the first accused, allies with thieves.  
    - If a Loyal Henchman or Cleaner is accused first, allies with Street Urchin.  
  - **Traitor**:  
    - If the game ends in GAME OVER (e.g., no Joker to give), the Traitor becomes the new Godfather and continues the investigation.  
    - If a Loyal Henchman is accused, that Henchman and the richest thief win.  
  - **Minion**: Wins if the Traitor wins.  
  - **Revolutionaries (2)**: Win together if accused; they share victory with the poorest thief.  
  - **Diamond Lover**: Wins if accused; shares victory with the player who has the most diamonds.

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends under one of these conditions:  
- **The Godfather wins**: Recovers all 15 diamonds.  
- **GAME OVER**: The Godfather selects a non-thief with no Jokers left (unless role is CIA/FBI/Diamond Lover/Revolutionary).  
  - Traitor becomes new Godfather and continues.  
- **Immediate win**:  
  - CIA/FBI accused → that agent wins alone.  
  - Cleaner kills CIA/FBI → Cleaner wins alone.  
- **Normal end**: Investigation ends naturally.  
  - Thieves reveal diamonds.  
  - Winner determined by roles:  
    - Highest uncaught thief wins (ties shared).  
    - Street Urchin wins if any thief wins.  
    - Driver wins if person on right wins.  
    - Henchmen win with The Godfather.  
    - Others per special conditions.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a player be both a thief and a Street Urchin?** No. Street Urchin is defined by taking 0 (last player) or receiving an empty box. They do not steal diamonds.  
- **What happens if The Cleaner shoots a non-CIA/FBI player?** Both The Cleaner and the player are out. If the player was a thief, diamonds go back to The Godfather.  
- **Does The Godfather get a Joker for accusing a CIA/FBI agent?** No. No Joker is given when accusing CIA, FBI, Diamond Lover, or Revolutionary.  
- **Can The Cleaner act after The Godfather says “Empty your pockets” but before the player reveals?** Yes—this is the only valid window.  
- **What if multiple players tie for most diamonds?** They share the win.  
- **Can The Godfather accuse the same player twice?** Only if the player has the Green Fake Diamond and reveals it; otherwise, no.  
- **Who wins if The Godfather runs out of Jokers?** GAME OVER. Traitor (if present) becomes new Godfather and continues. If no Traitor, game ends with no Godfather win.
