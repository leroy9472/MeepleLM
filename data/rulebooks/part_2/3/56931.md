## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective  
In *Arena Roma II*, players take on the role of powerful Roman rulers vying for dominance during a time of revolt. By skillfully deploying character and building cards, managing resources, and engaging in strategic battles, players aim to amass the most victory points (VP). Victory is achieved through economic strength, tactical card use, and weakening opponents. The game can be played standalone or combined with *Roma* for expanded gameplay.

### 2. Components  
- **55 Cards**:  
  - 26 yellow **Character cards**  
  - 29 green **Building cards**  
- **1 Icon Bar**:  
  - Assembled from 5 parts  
  - Displays die icons 1–6, plus "bribery", "money", and "cards" icons  
- **36 Victory Points (VP)**:  
  - Denominations of 1 VP and 2 VP  
- **Sestertii (Money)**: Used to pay card costs and activation fees  
- **6 Action Dice**:  
  - 3 per player, in player colors  
- **1 White Battle Die**: Used during attacks  
- **1 Rules Leaflet**

### 3. Setup  
1. Assemble the icon bar and place it in the center of the play area.  
2. Each player:  
   - Takes 10 VP as personal supply  
   - Chooses 3 action dice of one color  
3. Place remaining VP, money, and the battle die within reach as general supply.  
4. Shuffle the 55-card deck and:  
   - Deal 5 cards face down to each player  
   - Each player selects 2 cards from their hand and gives them face down to their opponent  
   - Players add received cards to their hand (now 5 cards total)  
5. Place remaining cards face down as draw pile; create discard pile nearby.  
6. Youngest player is start player.

**Beginner Variant**:  
- Cover the "bribery" icon on the bar  
- Deal only 4 cards per player (no card exchange)

### 4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns in order. Each turn has **three phases**:

#### Phase 1: Evaluate Vacant Spaces  
- Count unoccupied spaces on your side of the icon bar under die icons (1–6) and "bribery"  
- For each vacant space, forfeit 1 VP to the general supply  
- *Exception*: "Money" and "Cards" icons are not playable spaces and are ignored  
- **First turn note**: Start player begins with 5 cards but 7 possible spaces → forfeits 2 VP

#### Phase 2: Roll Action Dice  
- Roll your 3 action dice  
- If all three dice show the same number, you may re-roll all three once (optional)  
- Re-roll applies even if beneficial

#### Phase 3: Perform Actions  
You may perform any number of the following actions in any order, using die results from Phase 2:

##### a) Play Card(s)  
- No die required  
- Play one card from hand to any unoccupied space on your side (under die 1–6 or "bribery")  
- If space is occupied, discard the current card there  
- Pay card’s cost in Sestertii to general supply  
- Cannot play if insufficient funds

##### b) Collect Money  
- Assign one die to "money" icon  
- Gain Sestertii equal to die value  
- May repeat with other dice

##### c) Draw Cards  
- Assign one die to "cards" icon  
- Draw number of cards equal to die value  
- Keep 1 card; discard the rest  
- If draw pile is empty, shuffle discard pile to form new draw pile  
- No hand limit

##### d) Activate a Card  
- Assign one die to a die icon (1–6) or "bribery" icon on your side  
- Activate the card adjacent to that icon  
- Effect resolves immediately  
- For "bribery" icon:  
  - Must pay Sestertii equal to the die value used  
  - May activate only **once per turn**  
- Cards may be activated multiple times if multiple matching dice are available (except bribery)  
- Cards with crossed-out die icon are **always active** when face up  
- Some cards require two dice for full effect (see individual card text)

### 5. Core Mechanics  

#### Card Activation Rules  
- Only one card per icon space per player  
- Cards must be clearly assigned to one icon  
- Cards can replace existing cards (original discarded)  
- Die results cannot be split or reused  

#### Battle Mechanic  
- Triggered by specific cards (Arena, Ballista, Bestia, Decurio, Mercennarius)  
- Active player (attacker) rolls the **battle die** → attack value  
- Compare to **defense value** (shield icon) of target card  
- If attack ≥ defense, defending card is discarded  
- If attack < defense, no effect  
- Modifiers from other face-up cards are **cumulative**  
- Attacker may be modified by own cards (e.g., Decurio +1)  
- Defender may be modified by opponent's cards  

#### Special Card Types  
- **Always Active**: Cards with crossed-out die icon (e.g., Tuba, Telonium)  
- **Bribery Activation**: Requires die + payment; limited to once per turn  
- **Two-Die Activation**: Some cards require both die number and value for full effect
