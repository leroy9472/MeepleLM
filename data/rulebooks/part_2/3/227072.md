## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
In Chameleon, players take on the role of codebreakers using secret coordinates to discover a hidden word tied to a given topic. One player is the Chameleon — an impostor who does not know the secret word and must blend in by mimicking others.  

The objective depends on your role:  
- **Codebreakers**: Identify and vote out the Chameleon without revealing the secret word.  
- **Chameleon**: Avoid detection, deduce the secret word through others’ clues, and if caught, guess the secret word correctly to minimize point loss.

2. Components  
- Code Cards (one per player, all identical except one is replaced with a Chameleon Card)  
- Topic Cards (showing themed words in a grid format, e.g., Food, Animals)  
- Two Dice (yellow and blue, used to generate coordinates)  
- Blue Chameleon Card and Green Chameleon Card (used to track the Chameleon role across rounds)  
- Dry-erase pen and super-size Topic Card (optional, for custom play)  

3. Setup  
- Gather 4–6 players.  
- Shuffle the Blue Chameleon Card into a matching set of Code Cards.  
- Deal one card face down to each player. Only the Chameleon knows their identity.  
- Place a Topic Card face up in the center.  
- Designate a starting dealer (can be random).  

4. Gameplay Flow  
1. **Roll Coordinates**: The dealer rolls the yellow and blue dice.  
2. **Determine Secret Word**: All players with Code Cards use the dice numbers to find a grid coordinate (e.g., Yellow=3, Blue=6 → A4).  
   - They then locate the word at that coordinate on the Topic Card (e.g., A4 = Chicken).  
   - The Chameleon cannot do this and must bluff.  
3. **Give Clues**: Starting with the dealer and proceeding clockwise, each player says **one word** related to the secret word.  
   - Words must be single, spoken without hesitation.  
   - No repeats or overly obvious clues (e.g., saying “Chicken” when the word is Chicken).  
4. **Vote**: After all clues, players discuss and vote on who they believe is the Chameleon.  
   - If two players tie, the dealer breaks the tie.  
5. **Reveal**: The player with the most votes reveals their card.  
   - If it’s a Code Card: The Chameleon survives. Round ends.  
   - If it’s the Chameleon Card: The Chameleon is caught. They may attempt to guess the secret word.  
6. **Score**: Apply scoring based on outcome (see Scoring).  
7. **Next Round**:  
   - Switch decks (use Green Chameleon Card and matching Code Cards).  
   - The Chameleon from the previous round becomes the new dealer.  
   - Repeat setup and play.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Clue-Giving**: Each player gives one related word. Must be relevant but not revealing.  
- **Bluffing**: The Chameleon must give plausible clues without knowing the word.  
- **Deduction**: Players analyze clues and behavior to identify inconsistencies.  
- **Secret Word Access**: Only players with Code Cards can determine the word via dice roll and grid.  
- **Role Rotation**: The caught (or surviving) Chameleon becomes the next dealer.

6. Scoring & End Game  
Scoring is optional. First player to **5 points** wins.  

- **Chameleon escapes undetected**:  
  - Chameleon scores 2 points.  
  - All others score 0.  
- **Chameleon is caught but guesses secret word correctly**:  
  - Chameleon scores 1 point.  
  - All others score 0.  
- **Chameleon is caught and fails to guess secret word**:  
  - Chameleon scores 0 points.  
  - All others score 2 points.  

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Tie in voting**: Dealer has the deciding vote.  
- **3-player variant**: If the Chameleon is caught, they get **two guesses** at the secret word instead of one.  
- **7 or 8 players**: Not supported — text is corrupted and unplayable.  
- **Custom play**: Use the dry-erase pen and super-size Topic Card to create custom topics.  
- **Chameleon becomes dealer**: Regardless of outcome, the Chameleon from the previous round deals the next.
