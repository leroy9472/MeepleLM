## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
As French entrepreneurs, players compete to build railroads across France, connecting cities to increase the value of railway companies. The goal is to maximize victory points by strategically acquiring and trading shares in the most profitable companies, based on how extensively their rail lines are built.

The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins. In case of a tie, the first player (start player) wins.

2. Components  
• 1 game board showing a map of France with city and rural hexes, including Paris (Eiffel Tower hex), six starting suburban hexes, and a company value track  
• 198 locomotives (cubes), 33 each in 6 colors (representing railway companies: Blue, Brown, Yellow, Purple, Red, Black)  
• 6 player screens  
• 6 locomotive storing boards (one per color)  
• 1 linen bag  
• 1 start player locomotive (marker)  
• These rules

3. Setup  
1. Each player receives a screen.  
2. Randomly place one locomotive of each color:  
 a. In each of the six start hexes surrounding the Eiffel Tower (Paris).  
 b. On the starting position (value 0 or 1) of the company value track for each color.  
3. Place all remaining locomotives into the linen bag.  
4. Each player draws a number of locomotives from the bag and places them behind their screen (hidden):  
 • 3 players: 10 each  
 • 4 players: 8 each  
 • 5 players: 6 each  
 • 6 players: 5 each  
5. Distribute any remaining locomotives from the bag onto the locomotive storing boards, sorted by color.  
6. The start player is chosen randomly and receives the start player locomotive.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Players take turns clockwise, beginning with the start player. On their turn, a player must perform exactly one of two actions: **Build Track** or **Trade (Sell & Buy)**. Passing is not allowed.

5. Core Mechanics  

**Action 1: Build Track**  
- Take 1–5 locomotives from a single locomotive storing board (must be same color).  
- Place them on the board as track, following these rules:  
  • Must be adjacent to an existing locomotive of the same color.  
  • Cannot cross hexes divided by a checkered or heavy black line (not adjacent).  
  • No two locomotives of the same color may occupy the same hex.  
  • City hexes: maximum 1 locomotive (any color).  
  • Rural hexes: maximum 2 locomotives, must be different colors.  
  • Eiffel Tower hex and start hexes: no locomotives may be placed.  
  • A company’s track must always allow a connection from its start hex to at least one city (cannot be fully cut off).  

- Scoring during build:  
  • When a locomotive is placed in a **city hex**, the player immediately scores victory points equal to the current value of that company (shown on the company value track).  
  • Points are recorded on the scoring track.  
  • Placing in rural hexes does not score points.

**Action 2: Trade (Sell & Buy)**  
- **Sell**: Return 1 locomotive from behind your screen to its corresponding locomotive storing board.  
- **Buy**: Take 1 or 2 locomotives from **one different** color’s storing board and add them to your hidden stock.  
- You may not sell and buy the same color in one turn.  

- Maximum hand size by player count:  
  • 3 players: 20 locomotives  
  • 4 players: 15 locomotives  
  • 5 players: 12 locomotives  
  • 6 players: 10 locomotives  
- Exceeding the limit is allowed during play, but incurs a penalty at endgame.

6. Scoring & End Game  
The game ends immediately when **either** of the following occurs:  
- Only one locomotive storing board has locomotives remaining (i.e., 5 are empty).  
- Marseille has been connected by a railroad (a locomotive of any color is placed in the Marseille city hex).  

**Final Scoring:**  
- Reveal all hidden locomotives.  
- For each locomotive (share) a player owns, score points equal to the current value of that company on the company value track.  
  Example: 3 red locomotives × value 7 = 21 points  
- For each locomotive **above** the maximum allowed: subtract 20 points per excess locomotive.  
- Total all points.  
- Highest score wins.  
- Tiebreaker: the start player wins.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can I build track if no locomotives of a color are available on the storing board?**  
  No. You can only build with colors that have locomotives on their storing board.

- **Can I build more than one color per turn?**  
  No. Only one color may be used per build action (1–5 locomotives of the same color).

- **Can I trade the same color I just built with?**  
  Yes, as long as you don’t sell and buy the same color in the trade action.

- **What if building to Marseille triggers the end, but another condition is also met?**  
  Game ends immediately when either condition is met. Simultaneous fulfillment is possible and valid.

- **Are excess locomotives penalized during the game?**  
  No. Penalty is only applied at final scoring.

- **Do rural connections increase company value?**  
  No. Only placing a locomotive in a **city** increases the company’s value (via immediate scoring).
