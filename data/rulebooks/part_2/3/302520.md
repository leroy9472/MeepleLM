## Hues and Cues — Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Hues and Cues is a color-based guessing game that challenges players’ ability to describe and interpret colors through carefully chosen word cues. The objective is to score the most points by either accurately guessing the color described by the cue giver or by giving cues that result in other players guessing colors close to the target.

2. Components  
- 1 Game Board (featuring a grid of colors with letter and number coordinates)  
- 100 Color Cards (each showing 4 colors with their coordinates)  
- 30 Player Pieces (3 pieces in each of 10 player colors)  
- 1 Scoring Frame (a transparent overlay used to determine scoring zones)

3. Setup  
- Place the game board in the center of the play area.  
- Each player takes 3 pieces of one color.  
  - Place one piece on the starting space of the scoring track (to the left of “1”).  
  - Keep the other two pieces for gameplay.  
- Shuffle the color cards and place them face-down to form a draw pile.  
- Set the scoring frame nearby.  
- For first-time play: Assemble the scoring frame by sliding pieces A and B onto C and D, with fronts (side with “1”) facing outward and backs (side with “2”) facing inward.  

Determine the first cue giver: The player wearing the most colorful outfit starts.

4. Gameplay Flow  
Each round follows this sequence:

1. **Draw a Card**  
   - The cue giver draws the top card from the deck and looks at it secretly.  
   - They choose one of the four colors shown on the card. The color’s coordinates (letter and number) will be used later for scoring.

2. **One-Word Cue**  
   - The cue giver gives a one-word clue to describe the chosen color.  
   - **Restrictions on cues:**  
     - Cannot use basic color names: *purple, blue, green, red, pink, yellow, orange, brown, white, black, grey*.  
     - Abstract or specific color names (e.g., *chartreuse, lavender, terracotta*) are allowed.  
     - Cannot refer to the color’s position on the board (e.g., “top row,” “near B5”).  
     - Cannot reference objects in the room (e.g., “like your shirt”).  
     - Cannot repeat a clue previously used in the game.

3. **First Guesses (Clockwise Order)**  
   - All other players, in clockwise order, place one of their pieces on a color space they believe matches the cue.  
   - Each color space may only be guessed once (only one piece per space).

4. **Two-Word Cue**  
   - After all first guesses are placed, the cue giver gives a second clue.  
     - This clue may be:  
       - A two-word phrase (e.g., “sunset glow”), or  
       - A single word (same restrictions apply), or  
       - A pass (no clue given).  
   - **Important:** The clue cannot suggest positional comparisons like “lighter” or “darker” relative to existing guesses.

5. **Second Guesses (Counterclockwise Order)**  
   - Players place their second piece on any unoccupied color space, in counterclockwise order.  
   - Again, no color may be guessed twice.

5. Core Mechanics  
- **Cue Restrictions:** Clues must be descriptive and imaginative, avoiding direct references to color names, positions, or real-world objects.  
- **Guessing Order:** First round of guesses is clockwise; second round is counterclockwise.  
- **Cue Giver Strategy:** The cue giver may choose to pass on the second clue if they are satisfied with the first-round guesses, ending the round early and preventing second guesses.  
- **Color Uniqueness:** Only one player may guess a given color space per round.

6. Scoring & End Game  
- After second guesses, the cue giver places the scoring frame over the board, aligning the correct color (from the card) in the center using its coordinates.  
- The scoring frame creates three zones:  
  - **Center (exact match):** 3 points  
  - **Inside the frame (but not center):** 2 points  
  - **Adjacent to the frame (including diagonally):** 1 point  
  - **Outside these areas:** 0 points  

- **Scoring Summary:**  
  - **Guessers:**  
    - Correct color: 3 points  
    - Within scoring frame (but not correct): 2 points  
    - Adjacent to frame: 1 point  
    - Elsewhere: 0 points  
  - **Cue Giver:**  
    - 1 point for each guesser’s piece inside the scoring frame  
    - In 3-player games: 2 points per piece inside the frame  

- Maximum possible scores per round:  
  - Cue giver: 9 points (if all 9 guessers’ pieces are in the frame)  
  - Individual guesser: 5 points (3 for correct + 2 for second piece in frame)

- After scoring:  
  - All guessing pieces are returned to players.  
  - The next player clockwise becomes the new cue giver.  
  - A new card is drawn and play continues.

- **Game End:**  
  - With 3–6 players: Each player is cue giver **twice**.  
  - With 7–10 players: Each player is cue giver **once**.  
  - After all cue giver turns are complete, the player with the highest score wins.  
  - **Tiebreaker:** Play additional rounds (skipping tied players as cue givers) until one of the tied players takes the lead.

7. FAQ or Edge Cases  
- **Can a clue be a single word on the second turn?**  
  Yes. The second clue can be one word, two words, or a pass.  
- **What if all color spaces are taken during first guesses?**  
  This is impossible in standard play. With up to 10 players, each placing 2 pieces, and the board having 81 color spaces (9x9), there will always be space.  
- **Can the cue giver guess their own color?**  
  No. Only other players guess; the cue giver does not place guessing pieces.  
- **Can “light” or “dark” be used in clues?**  
  Yes, as long as they are not used to reference position on the board (e.g., “darker than the last guess”).  
- **What happens if a player breaks a clue rule?**  
  The group should agree on a correction—typically, the cue giver must provide a new clue.
