# PART 1 — Comprehensive Reference Manual

## 1. Lore & Objective
In *Founding Fathers*, players take on the roles of influential delegates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. The goal is to shape the Constitution through political maneuvering, debate, and strategic voting, earning recognition as the true "Father of the Constitution." Victory is achieved by accumulating the most victory points through influencing votes, dominating debate tracks, and securing endgame bonuses based on faction influence.

## 2. Components
- Game board depicting Independence Hall, divided into Assembly Room, Committee Room, and Debate Floor
- 55 Delegate Cards (including 5 Planner cards)
- 12 Article tiles (each with historical and ahistorical sides)
- 40 Influence Markers (wooden blocks)
- 5 Player Reference Boards (with faction distribution and rules summary)
- 5 Scoring Markers
- 12 Voting Chits (Yea/Nay)
- 16 Debate Tokens (4 per faction)
- Rulebook and player aids

## 3. Setup
1. **Determine Players**:  
   - 3 players: Use Madison, Paterson, Sherman  
   - 4 players: Add Pinckney  
   - 5 players: Add Hamilton  
   Shuffle and randomly assign one reference board to each player.

2. **Distribute Player Materials**:  
   - Give each player their Planner card and 3 Influence Markers.  
   - Place each player’s scoring marker at “1” on the scoring track.

3. **Prepare Decks**:  
   - Shuffle all remaining delegate cards (including unused Planners).  
   - Deal 4 cards face-down to each player. Each player keeps 2, discards 2 to a face-up discard pile.  
   - Place 3 cards face-down in the Draw Pool.  
   - Place remaining cards in a draw deck.

4. **Prepare Articles**:  
   - Shuffle the 12 Article tiles.  
   - Place 4 beside the board as “Resolved,” historical side up (no red ring).  
   - Place 1 in the Assembly Room, 1 in the Committee Room, both historical side up.  
   - Stack the remaining articles near the Debate Hall.

5. **Prepare Debate Area**:  
   - Place voting chits near the vote tracker.  
   - Stack debate tokens by faction near their respective debate tracks.

## 4. Gameplay Flow
- Play proceeds in rounds. Each round consists of player turns in clockwise order, starting with Madison in Round 1. Subsequent rounds begin with the player after the one who ended the previous round.
- On a turn, a player performs **one** of four actions:
  1. **Declare a Vote**  
  2. **Speak in Debate**  
  3. **Enact an Event**  
  4. **Snub Delegates**
- After the action, the player replenishes their hand to 3 cards from the Draw Pool. The Draw Pool is then refilled to 3 cards from the draw deck.
- A round ends immediately when the Assembly Room vote reaches **7 Yea** or **6 Nay**, or when **George Washington** is played as an event.
- After a round ends, resolve:
  1. Assembly Room
  2. Committee Room
  3. Debate Hall
  4. Prepare for next round
- The game ends after 4 rounds (all 12 articles resolved). Final scoring determines the winner.

## 5. Core Mechanics

### Declare a Vote
- Play one or more delegates from the same state from hand.
- Vote Yea or Nay in the Assembly Room.
- Place one of your Influence Markers on the delegation to claim control.
- Mark the state’s vote on the voting tracker.
- **Faction Bias Rules**:
  - Delegates cannot vote against an article of their own faction.
  - Delegates cannot vote for an article of the opposing faction (Federalist vs. Anti-Federalist, Large States vs. Small States).
  - Planner cards are wild and may vote either way.
- **Overriding**:
  - A different player may override a vote by playing more delegates from the same state on the opposite side.
  - Original delegation is discarded; influence marker returned.
  - New delegation takes control.

### Speak in Debate
- Discard one or more delegates of the same faction from hand.
- Place or advance your Influence Marker on that faction’s debate track by the number of cards discarded.
- Maximum of one marker per track per player.
- Debate track maximum is 7.

### Enact an Event
- Discard one delegate card to trigger its event text.
- Events override normal rules.
- **Persistent Events** (Rising Sun symbol):
  - Remain in effect until the end of the round.
  - Place face-up in front of you.
- Some events allow:
  - Declaring a vote (treated as Declare a Vote action).
  - Discarding voted delegates (if all from a state are discarded, that state may vote again).

### Snub Delegates
- Discard any number of cards from hand.
- Replace them when replenishing your hand.

### Replenishing Hand
- After action, draw from Draw Pool to restore hand to 3 cards.
- Refill Draw Pool to 3 cards from draw deck.
- If deck is exhausted, reshuffle discard pile into a new deck.
- If your Planner card appears at the top of the deck, you may reclaim it immediately (even out of turn).

### Influence Markers
- Players start with 3.
- Additional markers can be gained via Planner events or specific cards (e.g., Sherman, Morris).
- Markers can be reclaimed from anywhere on the board (Assembly, Debate, Committee) when needed.
- Markers on losing side of Assembly vote move to Committee Room.

## 6. Scoring & End Game

### Round Scoring
1. **Assembly Room**:
   - **Winning Side**:
     - 1 VP per delegate.
     - +1 VP if delegate’s faction matches article’s bias.
   - **Losing Side**:
     - Influence markers move to Committee Room.
   - Discard all delegate cards.
   - If article failed, flip to ahistorical side.

2. **Committee Room**:
   - Player with most influence markers scores 1 VP per marker.
   - That player may choose to flip the Committee Room article.
   - Ties: no score, markers remain.

3. **Debate Hall**:
   - Player farthest on each debate track claims that faction’s token.
   - Ties: no token awarded.
   - All markers returned.

4. **Prepare Next Round**:
   - Discard persistent events.
   - Draw 2 new articles: one to Assembly Room, one to Committee Room (historical side up).
   - Clear voting chits.

### End Game Bonus (After 4 Rounds)
- Sort resolved articles by faction.
- Rank factions by number of articles:
  - 1st place: 5 VP
  - 2nd: 4 VP
  - 3rd: 3 VP
  - 4th: 2 VP
- If factions tie in article count, both receive the higher bonus.
- Player with most debate tokens in each faction earns the bonus.
- If players tie for most tokens, all tied players receive the full bonus.
- Highest total score wins. Ties result in shared victory.

## 7. FAQ or Edge Cases
- **Can I override my own vote?**  
  No. Only another player may override.
- **Can I add to an existing vote?**  
  No. Once a state votes, no additional delegates may be added.
- **Can I change my vote later?**  
  No.
- **Can I declare a vote without an influence marker?**  
  No. An influence marker is required.
- **What if I run out of influence markers?**  
  You may reclaim any of your markers from the board.
- **Can debate tracks exceed 7?**  
  No. 7 is the maximum.
- **Does George Washington’s event pass the article if no votes are cast?**  
  Yes. The article passes on the historical side.
- **Do Planner cards score 2 points if faction matches?**  
  No. Planners are not “wild” for scoring—only for voting eligibility.
- **Can I use an event to place a marker on debate track if none is there?**  
  Yes (e.g., Dickinson, Butler, Martin).
- **Do influence markers move with delegations?**  
  No. They remain with the controlling player unless moved by game effects.
