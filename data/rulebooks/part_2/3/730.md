## Comprehensive Reference Manual

1. Lore & Objective  
Breakout: Normandy is a historical wargame simulating the Allied invasion of Normandy and the subsequent breakout from the beachheads in June–July 1944. The game is asymmetrical, with one player controlling German forces attempting to contain the invasion, and the other player commanding Allied forces striving to establish a foothold and break out into open territory.

**Victory Conditions (22.1 & 22.2):**  
- The **Allies win** by achieving a **Breakout**: they must control a Zone connected to a Beach via a supply line and hold both until the end of the current day.  
- Alternatively, the Allies win by accumulating **9.6 or more Victory Points** by the end of a weekly victory check.  
- The **Germans win** if neither of these conditions is met by the end of the game.

2. Components  
- Game map of Normandy  
- Counters representing infantry, armor, artillery, and special units (e.g., FLAK, Coastal Artillery, Nebelwerfers)  
- Impulse Track and Advantage marker  
- Weather and Turn Track  
- Rulebook with sequence of play, combat, movement, and special rules  
- Reinforcement schedules  
- Cards (from "Breakout Normandy Cards.md", though content not detailed)  
- Supply and status markers (Fresh, Spent, Disrupted)  
- Scoresheet for tracking game rounds, bids, sides, and status

3. Setup  
- Players bid for the Advantage marker; higher bidder chooses side (German or Allies).  
- Units are placed per historical scenarios (D-Day setup detailed separately).  
- The Advantage marker is placed on the Impulse Track according to bid difference.  
- Weather is set per scenario.  
- The Turn marker is set to the starting Impulse.

4. Gameplay Flow  
**Sequence of Play (21.1):**  
Each day consists of multiple impulses. The standard sequence (excluding D-Day) is:  
1. **Dawn Reinforcement Phase** (skipped on D-Day)  
2. **Daylight Movement/Attack Phase**  
   - Units move and conduct assaults  
   - Mandatory and optional assaults resolved per 8.51–8.52  
3. **Evening Refit Phase**  
   - Spent units may attempt to become Fresh (if not disrupted)  
4. **Night Regroup Phase**  
   - Units may reposition within friendly-controlled areas  
   - Stacking limits observed  

**D-Day Sequence (Modified):**  
1A. **Airborne Phase**  
1B. **Naval Bombardment Phase**  
1C. **Air Bombardment Phase**  
1D. **Amphibious Assault Phase**  
2. **Daylight Movement/Attack Phase**  
3. **Evening Refit Phase**  
4. **Night Regroup Phase**

5. Core Mechanics  

**Movement (8.36):**  
- 1 MF: Free Area  
- 2 MF: Enemy-controlled Vacant Area  
- 3 MF: Area with only Spent/Disrupted enemy  
- 4 MF: Area with Fresh enemy  
- Additional costs:  
  - +1 MF to cross river without bridge (Infantry only)  
  - +1 MF to enter Zone  
  - +1 MF for Overrun (Spent/Disrupted: +1, Fresh: +2)  
  - +1 MF per bridge seizure attempt (max one per bridge per impulse)  
  - +1 MF for non-seizing unit to cross bridge seized in same impulse  

**Assaults:**  
- **Mandatory Assault (8.51)** if:  
  - Entering enemy-occupied area not Contested at impulse start  
  - Entering Contested area across enemy-held bridge/river  
  - Landing on Beach with undestroyed Fortification  
  - Crossing river into Contested area without bridge (if bridge is enemy-held)  
- **Optional Assault (8.52)** otherwise  

**Attack Value (AV) (9.2):**  
AV =  
A. Attack Factor of chosen Point Unit  
B. +1 per additional assaulting unit  
C. +1 per supporting Field Artillery  
D. +1 per division with ≥3 units in attack (Divisional Integrity)  
E. +1 if Allies in Clear Weather (Air Support)  
F. –1 if SS and Wehrmacht units attack together  

**Defense Value (DV) (9.3):**  
DV =  
A. Defense Factor of chosen Forward Unit (reduced by Disruption)  
B. + TEM of defending Area  
C. +1 if assault across enemy-held bridge  
D. +2 if assault across river without bridge (Mandatory only) — use highest of C or D, not both  
E. +2 if Germans defend Fortified Area  
F. +2 if Germans in Clear Weather (Air Support)  
G. +1 per Fresh defender (excluding Forward Unit)  

**Combat Results (9.4):**  
- **Failure (AV < DV):**  
  - No effect on defenders  
  - Supporting Field Artillery become Spent  
  - Other attackers marked "Disrupt 1"  
  - All attackers must retreat in Mandatory Assaults  
  - Retreat optional in Optional Assaults (unless started in area or came from Beach Approach)  
- **Stalemate (AV = DV):**  
  - No effect on defenders  
  - Point Unit becomes "Disrupt 1"  
  - Others and supporting artillery become Spent  
  - All may retreat (unless started in area)  
- **Success (AV > DV):**  
  - Defender removes CP equal to (AV – DV)  
  - Exception: Bocage reduces CP by 1  
  - All attackers become Spent at impulse end  

**Casualty Points (CP) (9.5):**  
- 1 CP =  
  - Fresh → Spent  
  - Spent → Disrupt 1  
  - Disrupt 1 → Disrupt 2  
  - Disrupt 2 → Eliminated  
  - Spent/Disrupted unit retreating (cannot retreat and be eliminated)  
- Forward Unit must take first CP  
- **Overrun (8.53):** If CP exceed defender capacity, attackers may continue moving (except in Bocage or Zones)

**Retreat Rules:**  
- **Limits (9.63):**  
  A. Only Infantry may retreat across rivers without bridge  
  B. No retreat across unbridged flooded boundary, sea, or enemy-held bridge/river  
  C. No retreat into uncontested enemy-controlled area  
  D. No retreat into fully stacked area  
  - Retreating units must move to area adjacent to fewest enemy-controlled areas  
- **Priorities (9.64):**  
  A. Free Area adjacent to fewest enemy-controlled areas  
  B. Friendly-Controlled, Contested Area  
  C. Enemy-Controlled, Contested Area  
  D. Fully-stacked Area — must continue retreating until reaching non-fully-stacked area  
- **9.66 Retreat Distance:**  
  - Must end in adjacent area unless fully stacked  
  - If forced into fully stacked area, must retreat again  
  - Units unable to retreat must absorb CP via disruption/elimination  

**Bombardment (10.3):**  
- Bombardment DV =  
  A. + TEM of area  
  B. +2 if Fortified (Germans)  
  C. +1 per:  
    - Fresh FLAK (vs Air Bombardment)  
    - Fresh Coastal Artillery (vs Naval Bombardment)  
    - Fresh Field Artillery (vs Field Artillery bombardment)  
  - Nebelwerfers do not increase DV; Field Artillery does not increase DV vs Nebelwerfer

- **17.11:** No weather change during Naval or Air Bombardment Impulse  
- **17.12:** Advantage marker does not advance during Naval/Air Bombardment Impulse  
  - But Sunset roll can still end the day  
- **11.21 (Allied Losses):**  
  - Eliminating 1 Allied unit: lose Advantage if held  
  - >1 eliminated: lose Advantage + German moves marker 1 space per unit beyond first

  - Cannot have one fire while another remains Fresh in same area  
  - Mixed British/American: if one fires, other becomes Spent without firing  
- **19.4 Interdiction:**  
  - If first landing unit is interdicted, all others in impulse are subject to same interdiction, even if interdicting unit is later spent/eliminated  
- **20.1 Bridges:**

- **Q:** Can Advantage shift more than 3 spaces if multiple units eliminated?  
  **A:** No — max 3 spaces per Impulse (11.24)  
- **Q:** Can units overrun in Bocage or Zones?  
  **A:** No — Overrun prohibited in Bocage or Zones (Overrun 8.53)
