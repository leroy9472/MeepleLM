## Comprehensive Reference Manual

### 1. Lore & Objective
In *Edo*, players assume the roles of Daimyos during Japan’s Tokugawa era (1603–1868), tasked with developing Edo (modern-day Tokyo) and surrounding cities. The objective is to gain the most power points (VP) through building, trading, and accumulating wealth. To qualify for victory, a player must have built at least one house in Edo by game end.

### 2. Components
**Shared Components:**
- 1 double-sided game board (for 2/3 or 4 players)
- 12 Shogun officials
- 8 fortresses
- 54 Ryo coins (6×5, 8×10, 10×1)
- 120 resources: 20 rice, 20 wood, 20 stone (each in 4 units)
- 12 special authorization cards
- 10 merchant cards
- 3 cover tiles
- 24 profit tiles (pink for Edo, gray for cities)
- Start player marker
- Merchant figure

**Per Player:**
- 1 planning board
- 3 authorization cards
- 5 officials
- 7 houses
- 1 trading post
- 1 score marker (on VP track starting at "1")
- 1 game summary/reference sheet

### 3. Setup
1. Place board with player-count side up. Put Shogun officials, fortresses, and money in supply boxes.
2. Place wood, stone, and rice in common supply piles.
3. Shuffle special authorization cards; place deck face-down and reveal top 5.
4. Shuffle merchant cards; place deck face-down in left merchant box. Reveal top card to active spot, second card face-up on deck.
5. **For 2 or 4 players:**
   - Use cover tiles to randomly cover one profit chart per resource (wood, stone, rice).
   - Randomly mark one city (not Edo) as off-limits for building using an "X" tile or marker.
6. Draw:
   - One pink profit tile for Edo
   - One gray profit tile per active city
   Place each in its city center.

**Player Setup:**
- Each player takes 3 rice, 20 Ryo, planning board, 3 authorization cards, 5 officials, 7 houses, 1 trading post, and score marker (placed on "1").
- Randomly choose starting player. They receive start player marker and merchant figure.
- Create 5 resource packages:
  - 3 rice
  - 2 wood
  - 2 stone
  - 1 wood + 1 stone
  - 10 Ryo
- Starting to the right of the start player and proceeding counter-clockwise:
  - First round: Each player chooses to either take a resource package or place a house (on first building site) + one official (same color) in an unoccupied city (not Edo).
  - Second round: Repeat; those who took resources must place a house, and vice versa.
- Return leftover resource packages to supply.
- Start player places merchant figure on one of the 3 river spaces.
- All player-colored officials on the board become samurai. Neutral (Shogun) officials do not.
- Players may stack money to hide total; all other resources must be visible. Max 10 of each resource per player.

### 4. Gameplay Flow
Each round has 4 phases:

**Phase 1: Plan Actions in Secret**
- Simultaneously and secretly, each player:
  - Selects 1 action per authorization card (3 total).
  - Orders cards left to right on planning board (selected action facing down).
  - Assigns 1+ officials to each card to activate the action (1 official = 1 activation).
  - If no official is assigned, the action is skipped.
- All planning boards are revealed simultaneously.

**Phase 2: Perform Actions**
- Starting with the start player, players reveal and resolve their leftmost action card.
- Each player performs their action (or all activations if multiple officials assigned), then clockwise players do the same.
- Repeat for 2nd (center), then 3rd (right) action.
- Actions may be forfeited.

**Phase 3: Collect Wages and Income**
- **Wages:** Starting with start player, for each samurai on the board, player chooses:
  - Pay 1 rice to keep it on board.
  - Return it to planning board (becomes official for next round).
  - A player without rice must remove all samurai.
- **Income:** For each city with buildings:
  - Total influence points (IP): 1 per house, 2 per trading post (fortresses = 0).
  - Profit distributed based on IP ranking.
  - Tiebreaker: earlier builder wins.
  - Use profit tile matching number of players with buildings in that city.

**Phase 4: Prepare for Next Round or End Game**
- Check end conditions:
  - At least one player has ≥12 VP, OR
  - Merchant deck is exhausted.
- If not, continue:
  - Remove current merchant card from game.
  - Move face-up card from top of deck to active spot.
  - Flip new card face-up on deck (if available).
  - Pass start player marker clockwise.
  - Players retrieve authorization cards and place officials by planning board.
- If end condition met, proceed to final scoring.

### 5. Core Mechanics

**Actions Requiring Only Officials:**
- **Money (5 Ryo):** 1 official = 5 Ryo (up to 4x).
- **Money (7 Ryo):** 1 official = 7 Ryo (up to 4x).
- **Money (10 Ryo):** 1 official = 10 Ryo (up to 2x).
- **Rice:** 1 official = 1 rice (up to 4x).
- **Buy Rice:** Pay 3 Ryo = 2 rice (up to 2x); or pay 7 Ryo = 3 rice (1x).
- **Recruitment:** Pay 1 rice = gain 1 new official (available next round; cannot become samurai).
- **Travel:** For each official:
  - Place that official as a samurai on a border post, OR
  - Move up to 2 of your samurai anywhere (free).
- **New Authorization:** Pay 5 Ryo = take 1 face-up special authorization card (immediately refill).
- **Sell Authorization:** Sell 1 unused authorization or special authorization card = gain 30 Ryo (up to 2x).

**Actions Requiring Officials and Samurai:**
- **Resource Gathering (Wood/Stone/Rice):**
  - Must have 1 samurai on matching resource space per official assigned.
  - Yield depends on number of samurai on space: fewer samurai = more resources.
  - Max 10 of each resource type per player.
- **Building:**
  - Must have 1 samurai in target city per official assigned.
  - Can build: house, trading post (not in Edo), fortress.
  - Costs: See building chart (resources + money).
  - Gain VP immediately.
  - Buildings placed in order (arrow direction); max 10 per city.
  - Only 1 trading post per city.
- **Fortress Rules:**
  - 1 fortress allowed per every 2 houses in a city (any color).
  - Builder must own at least 1 house in that city.
- **Trading:**
  - Must have 1 samurai on merchant’s location per official assigned.
  - Current merchant card offers two options:
    - Buy 1–3 resources (up to limit)
    - Pay resources/money to gain 1 VP
  - With trading post in same city: can perform both options per action.
  - With 2 officials + 2 samurai + trading post: can do both options up to twice.
  - Before revealing card, may move merchant: 1 Ryo per space (even if not trading).
  - Cannot exceed resource limits during trade.

**Movement:**
- **Samurai:** May move at own expense before any action (including during Planning Phase, before revealing card). Cost: 1 Ryo per space.
- **Merchant:** May be moved by any player before revealing their action card. Cost: 1 Ryo per space. Cannot be moved for free during Travel action.

**Special Authorization Cards:**
- Cards with +1 or ×2 yield: Apply separately per action performed (i.e., per samurai yield).
- Cards reducing building costs: Apply once per building erected.

### 6. Scoring & End Game
**End Game Trigger:**
- Any player reaches 12+ VP, OR
- Merchant deck is exhausted.

**Final Scoring:**
- Players without a house in Edo are eliminated.
- Remaining players gain:
  - 1 VP per samurai on board.
  - 1 VP per 50 Ryo (round down).
- Highest total VP wins.

**Tiebreakers:**
1. Most combined resources (rice + wood + stone).
2. Highest influence in Edo (IP: house=1, trading post=2; tiebreaker: earlier builder).
